445022,Ziki,2010-03-18 15:44:00,128,this would make a great Hanukkah present
445025,Roy,2010-03-18 15:50:00,13728,A little late for that unless you meant to say Passover. What the heck...it's never too late to give a gift to someone.
445030,fish_fishburn,2010-03-18 16:03:00,1311,Are they the folding fillet knives Roy or are they made by some other?
445037,Roy,2010-03-18 16:20:00,13728,"No, these are the flexible 6"" blade, no-slip grip handle..includes the sheath and sharpener.  EDIT!  Oops, this is not on sale  for the whole week...this is just Saturday's door crasher. (March 20th)"

445294,pike slayer,2010-03-19 03:31:00,1177,"i have had one for about 2 years, they are a great little knife but i dont like it much. the end of the handle rubs on the table to much when skinning fish but other then that a good knife, just personal peference"
445341,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-19 09:31:00,2582,I grabbed one for the cottage a couple of years ago. I think they do the same sale every year. Can't go wrong for the price.
445418,NAW,2010-03-19 14:08:00,4022,"I got one for the same deal last year.  I like the knife, but the sharpening tool that comes with them is garbage.."
445430,darsky,2010-03-19 14:36:00,586,yup-if anyone knows anything about the Jewish holidays its Roy.
445438,Roy,2010-03-19 14:56:00,13728, hahahahahahahahaha
