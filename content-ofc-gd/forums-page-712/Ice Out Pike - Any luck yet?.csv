441111,Mykester,2010-03-07 20:04:00,241,"March Break next week, if the temperature can stay all week as it is today I'll definitely be on the Islands daily for pike."
441129,MSBruno,2010-03-07 20:43:00,369,I was out today.  Still lots of ice and very little places to fish.  Didn't see a single fish.
443298,yakpiker,2010-03-13 13:15:00,160,Toronto harbour is rolling this morning with whitecaps from the east...and the forecast for the rest of the weekend is brutal...lots of wind (50km/h + at times) and rain.  The western access to Hanlan's Point has opened somewhat...looks like the rowing channel still has ice on the south shore.  Only two more weekends for pike fishing so I hope next weekend is better.
443300,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-13 13:17:00,3761,"Yup, I'll be fishing Lake O pike, this Tuesday, next Saturday and the following Saturday. All booked up!"
443301,highdrifter,2010-03-13 13:19:00,2534, Going my way??!
443305,MSBruno,2010-03-13 13:37:00,369,"I was going to go out today, but the winds kept me home.  Maybe tomorrow."
443322,fishermccann,2010-03-13 15:12:00,655,"I was fishing for pike on Frenchmans Bay yesterday with a couple of other anglers, no fish caught. Last Sat. we were ice fishing on the Bay , this week open water and whitecaps."
443360,fish-miester,2010-03-13 16:24:00,864, I was gunna try my luck in and around there tomorrow for some toothy critters on my way to my dads house for dinner
443379,douG,2010-03-13 17:01:00,2693,Where is SNAG?  Conspicuous by his absence.
443382,MSBruno,2010-03-13 17:09:00,369," He's probably out making us look silly, catching all the mr and mrs pike we all can't."
443400,Tybo,2010-03-13 17:36:00,1373,Nice FisH!
443582,CLofchik,2010-03-14 01:45:00,854,"Hammy Harbour is open after all the ice grinding action over the last two days (there's more ice in the trees than in the water tonight!) This is the year I'm getting that 36""er...oh yes, I am.  Got all my baits doctored up, there's some Esox goin' DOWN!"
443614,vinnimon,2010-03-14 03:08:00,2593,"Oh no your not  Im going for their mamas and papas.I may take a stroll with my spin or bait caster in the AM.There should be an open spot there.My best was 18lbs down there on a #3 mepps.As too which one, Im not telling"
444603,fish_fishburn,2010-03-17 11:34:00,1311,"Been out on the Ottawa River four times so far in the canoe and nothing so far. All the main channel is wide open but the bays are still iced over. Was out yesterday and it was actually hot, about 14 degrees. Have been trolling stick baits and spinners as well as some casting. Probably a bit early but that doesn't matter. To bad the season closes at the end of March. I might go out today and play around in the islands, maybe the quebec side shore is more promising."
444780,fish-miester,2010-03-17 21:37:00,864,"I went out, and had a follow up but didnt commit !!!! then about half an hour later a guy about 30 feet from me caught a decent one around 36"""
444854,yakpiker,2010-03-18 00:28:00,160,I kayaked through the west end of the Toronto Islands after work tonight...all ice is gone and the water levels are very low.  I saw one mother of a wake and a mud path when I went through a shallow section...probably a big carp.  No other sightings or bites.  It's hard to be patient with presentation when you're fighting the clock and the sun to cover water.  Still was an awesome evening with a warm breeze and water as smooth as glass.
444978,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-03-18 13:53:00,0,I went down to the four stacks on lakeshore promenade yesterday. Didn't make any casts but I usually see them when they are there so it may be a little early.
439398,MSBruno,2010-03-03 21:14:00,369,"Anyone had any luck yet?  I'm planning on heading out this weekend, but unsure if the ice has broken."
439402,anders,2010-03-03 21:28:00,1168,ice out!!  thats not for another 4-5 weeks  hahaha
439404,Terry,2010-03-03 21:29:00,14456,you must be south of me
439405,MSBruno,2010-03-03 21:33:00,369, Toronto/Lake O
439410,cram,2010-03-03 21:42:00,1733, maybe a dumb question but i have never fished lake O for pike....when does season close/open?

439418,pike slayer,2010-03-03 22:16:00,1177,ya still a few weeks off here but by the winter we've been having it'll come early this year. and i wonder if its going to throw things off this year. there isnt gonna be much for flooding due to low snow conditions and the rivers wont be has high. if this weather keeps up the way it is then it'll be a really dry year with fire bans and what not. probably lots of weed growth in shallower lakes. i wonder how fishing will be never seen a year like this one.
439419,tdotfisherman,2010-03-03 22:18:00,317,"I have a boat.. and I fish around Toronto for Pike during the year..  Since the weather has gone above 0, I've had people that I took out last year asking me to take them out again.  Still way too much ice... End of the month some of the bays and harbours might be partially clear of ice, but who knows?"
439441,spinnerdoc,2010-03-03 23:49:00,556,can't wait to get them pikies at center island
439443,Rizzo,2010-03-03 23:51:00,4754,"sheesh I haven't started my ice fish season yet...this is when it starts to get good! Nice warm days, easy drilling, hibachi with a t-bone, some brown pops and flags popping up all over the place."
439446,Sudzy,2010-03-03 23:56:00,88, This exactly! lol
439453,Terry,2010-03-04 00:06:00,14456,"but I can say in the odd year  the cooks bay opened up before pike season closed, I have never done better for big pike, once you find them they are hungry and will hit anything"
439456,Sinker,2010-03-04 00:13:00,8692,"Ice out????? Dude, I was driving on 23"" of ice today. Break out your auger!!  S."
439473,Ben_Daniels,2010-03-04 00:46:00,435,Looks like there's open water in the Harbor. Harbour Cam .Probably no open water in the canals in the islands though. Harbor front or Ontario place might be good. A couple years ago around this time there was some crazy guys fishing around ice drifts in a float tube  Float Tube scroll down halfway.  -Ben
439478,yakpiker,2010-03-04 00:59:00,160,I was on the water last March and scratched the heck out of my kayak when the wind shifted some ice floes that blocked my exit from one of the channels.  I remember catching a few pike and losing feeling in my feet due to the cold.  Both my gear and my judgement are better this year so we'll see how the weather looks on the weekend.  Still lots of ice in and around the islands.
439506,CLofchik,2010-03-04 01:55:00,854,In Hamilton Harbour there's a yacht club that runs a bubbler all winter long to keep a few boats in the water ice free.  There's a patch of open water that's maybe 30'x20' you can cast to.   Nothing yet.
439658,NAC,2010-03-04 13:48:00,369,"Here's Kincardine's harbourcam - http://www.pilor.com/ ice should move out any day and the lake is wide open. Not sure how it relates to TO/Lake O harbours but with these warm temps, I'm thinking next week you should be able to start getting out in some spots. Good luck and let us know if you get out."
439661,MSBruno,2010-03-04 13:58:00,369,"with temps in the 5-10 degree mark in the next week, I'm heading our for some TO pike."
439663,vinnimon,2010-03-04 14:01:00,2593,"I seen that the other day, at the police marine unit building.Beside the yacht club.Years back icaught some monsters out of there."
439704,majorlifts,2010-03-04 16:14:00,171,"I have not seen the ice there off Leslie spit, although I suspect there is some, and by the time ice is out there Pike will be out. It only runs from January 1st to March 31st, then isnt opened till May 1st. Sad really, I had my best Pike ever down there, and always in Late March  Mid April. The new Regs SUCK."
439707,MSBruno,2010-03-04 16:18:00,369," Yeah, gotta take advantge of the fishing pre-March 31st."
439782,anders,2010-03-04 18:48:00,1168," I hear ya....this is when ice fishing shines....walleye, pike, lakers, and specks all come to play hard right now, till ice out in a month and a half, throw in some steel there and you got a great time of year."
439897,mike rousseau,2010-03-04 22:51:00,4661,im on the st.lawrence river and shes almost all the way open...im heading out tomorow for perch and maybe pike for a bit...  any tips on early season pike fishing...im kinda new at it
439925,diggyj,2010-03-04 23:22:00,548,0 for 1 on the ice out Pike this year. Hopefully things change over the next few days as I will be heading out.  Dirk
441105,yakpiker,2010-03-07 19:41:00,160,"What a beautiful morning here in TO...had to hit the water in my yak.  Took some fishing gear along too.  Not much access within the islands right now...one channel was blocked by a dock and the other by ice.  Tossed a husky jerk and spoon in a few spots, but no bites and no sightings.  The forecast is for temps to stay above freezing this week so maybe next weekend will be better. "
