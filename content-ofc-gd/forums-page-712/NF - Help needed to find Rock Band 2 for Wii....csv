Figured I'd just go pick one up...but NO!  I cant find it anywhere.  If anyone has a lead on it, please send me an email to [emailÂ protected] as the site is going down shortly!  I am willing to drive an hour or so from Durham region to pick it up.  New or used...doesn't matter...  But will need the kit...including the game disc, wireless drums, guitar and microphone.  Any help would be appreciated!  thanks!"
445482,Mykester,2010-03-19 17:01:00,241,"You will definitely find it online, amazon is your best bet for online video game purchases. Did you check EB Games?  Use the store locator:  http://www.gamestop.ca/StoreLocator.aspx  Call each one that's close to you and ask if they rock band 2 for the wii."
445490,Big Cliff,2010-03-19 17:17:00,6899,Go right to the Nintendo site.  Nintendo  If you order it directly from them you could have it in a few days. I've checked everywhere I can think of around here with no luck. I'll try the pawn shop this afternoon.
445492,Terry,2010-03-19 17:20:00,14456,I don't think those stores have it  you can find the game but not Rock Band 2 Special Edition (Nintendo Wii) that has everything.....you may need to buy used  there is the odd place to buy the different  individual Instruments but it would take a lot of running around  to get everything good luck or it's an IOU
445496,ccmtcanada,2010-03-19 17:38:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  Gotta love the internet!  I checked every Toys r us, Futureshop, Best Buy and EB games in Toronto and area.  Terry is right...you can get the game but not the entire kit.  I was finally told by the guy at EB games that it's likely discontinued now...as the new Rock Band 3 is coming out later this year.  I did however find a guy selling ALL his Wii stuff...but wiling to sell just his RB 2 and accessories...working on price now...  Thanks again everyone!"
