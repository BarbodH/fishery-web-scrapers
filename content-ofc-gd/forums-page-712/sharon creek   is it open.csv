444973,FisherMike,2010-03-18 13:29:00,108,"i drove by there on tuesday.  there is fishable open water on both roads.  there was one guy fishing but i didnt stop to ask if he was having any luck.  there was still a layer of slushy looking ice covering most of the water, but it is definitaly fishable and with these warm temps it should be wide open pretty soon."
