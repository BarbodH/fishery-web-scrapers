Needs a bit of work but that's up my alley. Now for the begging...lol. Anyone got any appliances or other stuff cheap for sale or free. We have a washer and dryer already. Anything else would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Curt"

It is a site dedicated for people to get rid of..or get... stuff for free. There are sites all over. In the last 3 years I have got a number of things for my home and cottage and quite a bit of stuff for my daughters first apartment. And it's all free. Check it out and good luck with your new home."
