248804,limeyangler,2008-09-12 05:21:00,5204,"Hi y'all,  got out to another new lake (for me) with chuck and his dad yesterday. Route lake is a fairly large lake about half an hour north of Dryden by logging road. Its a trout lake but has a good population of Walleye...and as with most lakes round here a fair few pike too.  We were pretty late getting to Chuck's dad (called Charlie), we had planned to be there at 8:30ish but it was closer to 10;30 by the time we rolled up. It was good to finally meet chuck's folks......they have a really nice dog too....lol    IFFRIT (i think thats how you spell it) WAS AN AWESOME LOOKING DOG!      Its been great to get out with chuck this summer, as he has shown me a few good local lakes with excellent fishing, and his dad a wealth of local knowledge too, and throughout the day he was giving me a rundown of the good spots on the lake, took us to a cliff on the lake with some old native pictographs, and showed me how to access a lot of little creeks that lead to little lakes. I must add here that according to chuck and his dad....a creek is the noise a floorboard makes....cuz they are originally from the southern states.....its actually called a 'crick'...lol....next thing i will be using crawdads and not crayfish baits...he...he....i know your gonna read this chuck ya ole redneck     WE FINALLY GOT ON THE LAKE BY NOON      After getting the boat in we headed straight to a good spot for Walleye Charlie has always fished. First fish in the boat was a tiny little pike, followed by what seemed to be walleye after walleye for charlie, while me and chuck just sat back and threatened to throw him in after about half an hour of catching NUFFINK!  The whole time Charlie was catching i kept wanting to ask him to slow his troll down as my walleye spinner was about midwater....lol....but i was in his boat.....and he was catching so i didn't. I was not wrong in my assumption though, because we soon discovered he was using a much heavier sinker so he was able to keep contact with bottom where the fish were. I did change up to a heavy jig to try and keep contact with the bottom and this seemed to work as it wasn't long before i managed to land one.    FISH AFTER FISH FOR CHARLIE UNTILL WE DISCOVERED HE WAS CHEATING WITH A HEAVIER SINKER        <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1939.flv"">         <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1943.flv"">     I SWITCHED TO A JIG WHICH SEEMED TO WORK...BUT CASTING AROUND 2 OTHERS IN THE BOAT WAS NOT IDEAL      After we discovered the heavy sinker solution we all started to catch pretty regularly. Chuck seemed to be getting a lot of pike, which was a nice change as that is usually my job.    A FEW MORE FOR CHARLIE       <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1952.flv"">     CHARLIE GOT THE BIGGEST AND SMALLEST FISH OF THE DAY      CHUCK FINALLY GOT INTO THE WALLEYE TOO      I GOT A COUPLE GOOD SIZE ONES TOO (i look pretty scary in that outfit....lol)      We were only 2 shy of our limit for walleye, and so decided to go to another spot when the bite died off. It was getting pretty windy and it was preety difficult holding the boat on a steady troll, or even at a stanstill with either the big motor or the small 4.5 HP, so we kept moving rtill we got a bite.   WE MOVED AROUND A BIT IN SEARCH OF OUR LIMIT  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_1951.flv"">     We found a spot behind a point of a small island, which was also a bit more sheltered and it was not long before we pulled in the last 2 walleye for our limit. After that we decided to try for some trout. charlie had suggested we 'soak' for them but the windy conditions changed his mind and we tried trolling. I think it was a bit too early to be trolling with sinkers in 10-30 FOW and think we may have done better using downriggers in the 30 -40 fow range in water upto 70 feet deep.....we did not catch any trout, but i will be coming back to this lake to try some icefishing for trout.   As i said earlier in the post Charlie showed us lots of interesting landmarks etc.....her's a few of the sights from the day.    PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST BEAVER DAMS I""VE SEEN YET      THIS EAGLE WAS ACTUALLY IN A TREE IN MY YARD BEFORE WE LEFT....STALKING MY CATS NO DOUBT       A NICE SPRING WITH EXCELLENT DRINKING WATER ON THE WAY TO THE LAKE       SEARCHING THE CLIFF FACE FOR NATIVE PICTOGRAPHS...PRETTY COOL                           A REALLY NEAT LOG ROLLER PORTAGE TO ANOTHER LITTLE 'CRICK'            AND A BEACH I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK TO NEXT SUMMER WITH THE TENT!              All in all another great day out...with good company...lots of laughs, lots of fish, and i got to see a whole load of stuff i would never have guessed was there."
