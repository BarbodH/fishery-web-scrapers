We'll be fishing for the first time so please bear with my ignorance.  We got access to a canoe and are going to buy cheap starter kits.  Any info would be appreciated...such as  1.  What kind of fish can we expect? (size, type) 2.  Do we have to paddle up to Lake Mary or could we stay on Muskoka river for good fishing? 3.  Do you recommend we eat our catch? If so, what kind of fish is good? 4.  Any advice on bait? (live vs lures)   Any other info would be appreciated.  I've had trouble finding info elsewhere. Hoping this yields something.  Thanks."
