248703,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-11 22:58:00,3761,I don't have a Ontario Regulations book on me and i would like to know some info of the creek/river fishing for salmon fishing in Oshawa. Saw somebody fishing at the local park today and am curious if people are auctually allowed to be fishing right now. Here is a picture of the area i was at.  So when can people start fishing and what time of year does it need to stop.  Thanks for any help given!!  Mike
