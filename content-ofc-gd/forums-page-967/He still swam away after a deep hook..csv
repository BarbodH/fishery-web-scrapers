He had the spoon right in the what i call the tongue, he was already bleeding a little bit but i got the hook out quickly. Should i be cutting the hook in this instance? He did swim away, which makes me happy."

248428,BeRad3000,2008-09-11 01:21:00,65,"I wouldn't doubt it. I hate when they get hooked bad like that, but i  guess it happens from time to time."

248435,GbayGiant,2008-09-11 02:05:00,1780,"The tongues usually no problem, if it's deeper in the throat it's a problem or in the gills is bad too, I usually only cut hooks if the fishes mouth is glued shut with a treble or if you can't pull it out with reasonable force or it's to deep in the throat to reach without ripping something. Not much more you can do other than trying to set the hook quicker but sometimes they just swallow it, and try to do the surgery before any pictures and in the water/net if possible, bout all you can do.  If it's really bad to the point where you think it's going to die just eat it, I usually fish the same area for at least 20-30min after a big fish release to make sure it doesn't float up, if it does try to revive it again or worst case take it home.  Oh, and nice fish."
248439,BeRad3000,2008-09-11 02:10:00,65,"Good advice, thanks."
248530,Reef Runner,2008-09-11 13:30:00,980,"Nice pike dude!  I find pike to be a very fragile fish and start bleeding if you look at them to hard, lol.  If it was in the tongue, I'm pretty sure the fish was fine.  Awsome catch!"
248536,bbog,2008-09-11 13:50:00,665,A beauty Frenchman's Bay Pike. Based on your description he should be okay.
248539,BillM,2008-09-11 13:54:00,17367,"Nice fish!!!   As everyone has said, getting a hook deep into the tongue isn't a spot that usually results in a fatality..   Got remember though, hooks are cheap..  If it takes longer then a min to get the hook out, just cut it...."
