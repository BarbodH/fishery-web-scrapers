We did manage a trip to Dryden area with endless walleye caught and even a day to Lac Seul.But that seems long ago . Hoping the change of seasons will result in renewed opportunities to get out there .  Hoping maybe Saturday morning for a wet ride around GBAY And have a weekend at the end of sept for a hunt camp clean up which always includes some early morning walleye .  Hope everyones had a safe and happy summer  talk to you all soon   TB

Bay, but please check with Enviroment Canada's webpage to give you Geo Bay weather and WIND conditions.  Maybe we can get out for a day during the next few weeks.  just JOHN"
