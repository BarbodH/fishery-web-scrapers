Is it possible to launch a 14.5 ft boat in there without sinking into the sand?? I also got a gas motor on it, will they allow it in there if I have the motor trimmed up with a garbage bag over the prop, and ONLY use my electric? Has anybody been hassled for launching a gas motored boat in there, even though they only used the electric?"
248657,jediangler,2008-09-11 20:19:00,1923,"You can have a boat with a gas motor as long as it's up and out of the water. The launch is tough unless you have a 4wd. I'm sure you could get the boat in, it's getting it back out that might be tricky. Not sure what the water levels are like, maybe someone else can give an update in that department."

248802,Fish4Eyes,2008-09-12 05:09:00,1022,"LOL how did you know I drove a toyota? Its a 4 runner 4WD, its got a ton of clearance but its heavy as hell, im worried about it sinking into the sand. What you guys think?"
248808,jediangler,2008-09-12 05:52:00,1923,I think as long as you have a 4X4 you'll be OK.
248816,modny,2008-09-12 10:34:00,502,"i also dont recomend launching any princecrafts in mountsberg, the ministry doesn't like those boats due to their color because they spook the bass and crappie fingerlings out of the shallows and into the mouths of pike."
248963,pokerdemon4,2008-09-12 17:52:00,135,Who cares what color his boat is.  You'll be fine with your 4x4 toyota.  Its a rough ramp but you can make it.
