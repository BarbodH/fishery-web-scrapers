The morning was dull and Grey with slight winds and a chance of rain however some die-hards decided to head out and give it a shot.  We watched the weather  forecast closely and would have moved the Tourney to Sunday had there been any chance that the boats entering would be put at risk. We left the Marina to head out to Port Maitland Pier at 6:30 am for shot gun start at 7:00 am  finding only a one foot chop on the water. By noon the skies started to clear and we ended up with a beautiful day. It seems all boats headed their own direction ...   There were 12 boats in total with many boats not being able to make it down  from other ports due to weather conditions the day before.   It turned out to be a great day on the water.
