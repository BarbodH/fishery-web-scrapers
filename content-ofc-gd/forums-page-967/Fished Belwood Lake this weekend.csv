I was planning on doing some exploring but it was pretty windy so I ended up fishing a bay that was a bit more protected from the wind and didn't leave since we were getting steady fish, and I brought a friend who doesn't get out much so he was loving it.  We probably got about a dozen smallies like the one below and about a dozen pike.  Most of the pike were small but 3 were decent, not huge but big enough to pull back.  We only got a couple of the smallies on tubes and the rest were smashing crankbaits which was fun.  I was impressed with the number of fish we caught and a couple of the bass were pretty good size (low batteries in the camera = no proof of those ones).  Here was an average bass for the day...  "

248046,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-09 21:03:00,0,Great report. I fished Belwood in the spring from shore and caught some pretty decent pike. I also fished the dam and did well also. Never fished the lake from a boat but I hear there are some pretty big pike in there. Sounds like you did pretty good. Anyways thanks for sharing.
248438,gogu392,2008-09-11 02:07:00,142,"Nice smalie. Good day on Belwood. Where did you fish, close to the dam or far away from dam? Tight lines."
248445,Rattletrap2,2008-09-11 02:30:00,1652,Nice Bass! I've driven past Bellwood and live fairly close. Do they allow outboards on that lake?
248453,Casey123,2008-09-11 02:55:00,461,Great Report.
248489,evster,2008-09-11 11:20:00,367," Yes they do, which is why I tend to wait until September to fish there.  It gets pretty busy out there.  Its a pretty deep lake.  They had already dropped the level quite a bit and it was still 45 feet deep in the middle."
248519,Reef Runner,2008-09-11 13:03:00,980,"Sounds like a great day, fish after fish, protected bay.  Gonna have to try Belwood once, sounds like an awsome place."
