248200,Breach,2008-09-10 09:23:00,25,"Just trying to make sure Ive got everything I need with me as Im going to be going after some pike Id like to be able to land it properly.  Pliers, wire cutters, net, that all i really need?"
248201,modny,2008-09-10 09:28:00,502,"you keep your net in your tackle box?  wow, Plano has thought of EVERYTHING!"
248216,ccmtcanada,2008-09-10 12:18:00,7971,"Hmmm....yeah...our net is pretty big, don't think it'll fit in our tackle box.  Anyhow, here's a few more items....  Scale, measuring tape, hook sharpener, scissors, flashlight (if fishing at night), jaw spreaders for pike, lindy glove if you don't like blood (your blood, not the pike's).  Not all of those items are for landing them specifically, but will help make an outing more complete."
248246,Reef Runner,2008-09-10 14:07:00,980,I would also have a towel and a piece of stainless steel to get that slime smell of your hands.  Wash your hands with the steel just as if it were soap.  A nifty tip.

248254,Casey123,2008-09-10 14:16:00,461,"To add to the first aid kit - Some Water Proof Tape for applying gauze pads.  We never use the gauze but the tape wrapped around the nicks and cuts keeps the infection out.  Also if you are like me, by the end of the day your thumbs will be chewed up and sore from hooks and fish teeth (I am convinced that there is a safe way to lip a pike LOL)."
248259,Bly,2008-09-10 14:21:00,1556," If you are going to continue in your pursuit of this, I would suggest super glue be added to your first aid kit lol   Small, quick, will close even deeper cuts until you are off the water and it is also waterproof ."
248264,bbog,2008-09-10 14:29:00,665,small bottle of bug juice...
248270,shane,2008-09-10 14:39:00,652,A zip-bag with toilet paper in case I have to make like a bear in the woods.
248272,bigugli,2008-09-10 14:45:00,6138,"Camp paper   water, twinkies  , jerky, compass, waterproof matches, first aid and sewing kits."

248345,wgk36,2008-09-10 19:16:00,69,I like to keep a lip grip in my box for those big ones.

248356,PERCHER,2008-09-10 20:09:00,787,(I am convinced that there is a safe way to lip a pike LOL).  There is another Board member who thought the same thing and I was there to wittness it.Not a pretty sight.Maybe he will chime in on lip gripping pike.
248369,Dutch,2008-09-10 21:19:00,831,"Bug head net  Muskol  A couple of those glow sticks from the dollar store, you bend them and they glow green  Side cutters  Needle Nose Pliers  Hook sharpener  Extra pair of polarized glasses  Tooth picks (for making plastic baits float)  Finishing nails (for making weedless baits sink faster)"
248371,CLofchik,2008-09-10 21:32:00,854,"Instead of a net I like the Normark stainless/kevlar mesh fillet glove.  Grips fish pretty good, no net untangling and a lot more portable than a net."
248385,nofish4me,2008-09-10 22:32:00,404," I've replaced that stuff with darts, cards, bug spray and spray on suntan lotion (have trouble gettin' guys to apply the other stuff on my back)."
248396,lew,2008-09-10 23:08:00,12767,"If your gonna be spending as much time fishin after dark as I do, you'll have to be sure you've got plenty of spare batteries for your headlamp.......one of the most important tools in your fish'n box."
248399,hurraylien,2008-09-10 23:15:00,95,i also hear washing your hands with toothpaste gets out the smell
248415,musky66,2008-09-11 00:37:00,273,"All of the above- but NOT in my tackle box. Several years back I started keeping all the stuff mentioned above in an inexpensive electricians tool bag. You can buy them at hardware stores, Home Depot, CTC, etc. I stuff it too the max and carry it in and out of my boat or friends- easy to pick up and take inside at end of the day as well. When it rains I stick it under my console. It has become indispensable. I keep only lures in my tackle box"
