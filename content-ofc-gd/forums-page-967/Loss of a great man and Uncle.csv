247731,LeXXington,2008-09-08 20:02:00,1928,"It is with the greatest regret that I must let you know that My uncle - Terry Hunt - the 2008 LakeAir Pike tourney winner has passed away. I can not express in words the joy he had on the trip and the smile that will be remembered forever or the picture holding the biggest pike of his life.  During that trip my uncle was complaining about slight acid reflux that continued to gain intensity during the summer. On Aug 7th they completed a check of the stomach and found stage 4 cancer that had completely blocked his stomach. He was told on Aug 14th that there was nothing to be done and the cancer had most likely spread.  He passed away this Sunday  When speaking to him he let me know that one of the greatest moments was catching that fish and the fun he had with my dad, me and Brother plus the many wonderful people he met.       Thanks again, all"

I am very familiar with gastric cancer as I am a care giver for a family member who suffered from it but won the fight so far. One reason why I have not had the chance to even wet a line this year or a few past . Looking at the huge smiles on Terry says it all though and brings a tear to our eyes making us count our blessings. I hope he passed peacefully. Rob
