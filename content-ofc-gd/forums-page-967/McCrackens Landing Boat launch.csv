248354,Paully,2008-09-10 20:05:00,712,"Directions from Toronto Follow Highway 401 east to Highway 35/115 (exit 436). Follow Highway 115 to Peterborough. Stay on the Peterborough bypass which will direct you towards onto Highway 7 towards Ottawa. At the 2'nd traffic light turn left onto Highway 28 (formerly 134) north. At 1'st Stop sign turnright onto County Road 4 to Village of Warsaw. Continue on County Rd. 4 through Warsaw (right then left at stop sign) north to stop sign at the Bethel Church. Turn right on County Rd 6 (Stony Lake Rd) and continue to stop at Hall's Glen. Turn left go about 1/2 Km then left on McCracken's Landing Road. Due North is about 1/2 Km on left hand side, watch for DueNorth sign on mailbox. About 2 Hours from Toronto Map  Perhaps this can help"
