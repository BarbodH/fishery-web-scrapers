248076,Jigger,2008-09-09 23:02:00,1237,"I've been following this remotely for the last year or two and now its time to fire up. This project could take the world in a great direction never before imagined. Or....we could all be space dust in the blink of an eye. Although even the experts against this project say its a very,very,very small chance of that happening.  I know its wikipedia, but it summarizes everything pretty well...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_the...Hadron_Collider  Eat, drink and be merry!"
248080,kickingfrog,2008-09-09 23:18:00,8333,"CBC radio's Quirks and Quarks just did a show about that particle accelerator. Neat stuff, even though much of it was a bit above me."
248089,mepps,2008-09-09 23:42:00,1301,We'll find out pretty soon!!
248091,kickingfrog,2008-09-09 23:50:00,8333,Boy I'm glad I kept all of my Y2K survival supplies.
248094,Pigeontroller,2008-09-10 00:06:00,2793,"Y2K survival supplies? Did they include a little booklet entitled ""What to do in the event the earth is swallowed by a black hole""!?"
248101,shane,2008-09-10 00:41:00,652,Looks like they're going to fire it up for the first time tomorrow.  http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Update_The_...rrow_23973.html
248107,carp-starter,2008-09-10 00:59:00,253,"December 21, 2012 is more interesting - on this date, the Mayan calendar ends.  Here is one piece of information.  http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-...maya-2012_n.htm  carp-starter  maybe we will find out that UFOs are real and the aliens are coming."
248131,kickingfrog,2008-09-10 02:01:00,8333," No, the book I have is titled ""dumbass things people worry about, that they really can't do nothin' about""."
248140,bigugli,2008-09-10 02:23:00,6138,We won't feel a thing if the worst happens.
248145,Wild,2008-09-10 02:31:00,704,Yes the end is in sight beginning tonight the first time the temp is supposed to go below 10 that's never a good sign.
248148,skeeter,2008-09-10 02:38:00,1907,   it is if you own a snowmobile and love ice fishing!!!!!!!!!!! 
248150,Jonaton,2008-09-10 02:41:00,72,"Even if a black hole were formed by the LHC it would be so small and so brief that it would be gone before it could do anything at all. There is no chance, absolutely zero that this will start a black hole that will suck up the universe.  As for the 2012 thing, the Mayan calendar ended several times, just in the past the good christians hadn't yet slaughtered them all so they were able to write another. With them all being dead now there is no new calendar"
248152,Bly,2008-09-10 02:45:00,1556,"  Ever read 2012 by Whitley Strieber?  The Mayan calenar, UFOS and aliens all in one book"

248273,Casey123,2008-09-10 14:45:00,461," Funny, I have the 3rd edition of this book."
248278,Canuck2fan,2008-09-10 14:56:00,1444,"Here today gone tomorrow will have a ""hole"" new meaning..... sorry couldn't resist. The best part is, is that it is win win. If it works and nothing bad happens they scientists involved will have done something totally amazing. If it goes bad it is not like anyone will be left to point a finger and call them stupid."

248436,POLLIWOGG,2008-09-11 02:05:00,835,Good thing is if we all die at once and there is no one to clean up after us we don't have to get rid of our porn and dope before we die.
248548,PatrickGG,2008-09-11 14:13:00,562,I suggest everyone here grab a rod and reel and a few rapalas at 12:30 before we go so we all have something to do while we wait in line.
248550,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-11 14:16:00,0,"Perfect timing. I was just wondering a few days ago, what was up with that and the next day, I get news they are going to start it up. The particles will be traveling slower than the speed of light. The black  It will be interesting to see the result. More than likely there will be super charged particles."
