248113,mikethespike,2008-09-10 01:23:00,51,"welcome aboard bro!  i was floatfishing downstream at the foot of trillium trail last labor day week end and 2 weeks prior,  caught/released mostly small trout  and white sucker.  their size doesn't even qualify as panfish.  don't ask me what the white sucker were doing there though i'm just as surprised finding a lot of them there.  maybe someone here has an idea?"
248117,John,2008-09-10 01:29:00,2956,Welcome Tony. Nice to see someone else who can still float fish with a spinning reel......
