248597,LeXXington,2008-09-11 17:17:00,1928,"Nice fish,  with your boat why peir fish, I take my boat down too bronte and park just out of reach of everyone casting and start casting.  Lots of room"
248615,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 18:08:00,7971," We typically only have an hour to an hour and a half to fish in the evening, so prepping the boat, launching and then taking the boat out and prepping it to be towed home is hardly worth it.  We have thought about it though, when there are lots of people down there!!"
248618,Bly,2008-09-11 18:20:00,1556,"Tracker....   Love the pic, I just might have to print and frame that one  LOL !!"
248704,Greencoachdog,2008-09-11 22:59:00,8163,  I think it's a little diffirent than that... I think bly actually poses with the fish she caught sometimes...
248715,salmon,2008-09-11 23:36:00,334," I had 50lb braid on a Calcutta 250 baitcaster last year. Almost got spooled real fast,  I snapped the fish off when I saw the black tape @ my spool. 10 1/2 ft St. Croix casting rod and I could not turn its head. Changed to 30 lb braid and no problems. Now Curado 300 and it has tons of line capacity. I still get outcasted by the spinning guys but not by much. Hope this helps Jose  Cliff, nice fish"
248716,PatrickGG,2008-09-11 23:39:00,562,"Thats one big salmon cliff, must have been one nice fight."

248779,skeeter,2008-09-12 02:36:00,1907,i see the red nails but no OFC COMMUNITY 2008 sign?????  nice fish by the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
248780,ccmtcanada,2008-09-12 02:37:00,7971, No OFC sign cause I caught a bigger one last week....just haven't updated our team thread yet!!
248447,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 02:34:00,7971,"Well, with bly's success last night, we decided to hit the piers one more time, this time trying a different trib mouth.  Talked to a bunch of fellow anglers who said there were lots around...lots of jumping and action.  A few hits and a few landed.  We found our spot out there and started casting our cleos.  Sure enough, we could see lots of action....I was hoping it was just a matter of time before one of us hooked into one.  When I first started fishing piers, I just did what everyone else seemed to be doing.  Chuck it out there and then start retrieving.  I read an article in a magazine that made complete sense so this is what I do now.  I cast out as far as I can, count to 5 and then start my retrieve.  I fan cast from my spot with the same count.  If nothing happens, I cast out, count to 10 and start the whole process again until finally my lure is hitting bottom.  Then it's start over again counting to 5.  Anyhow, on a 15 count, I felt a quick hit...set the hook and nothing is there.  I figured 15 was the number tonight, so I kept at that count.  Sure enough, about 10 minutes later, I feel another solid hit and the fish goes beserk!!!  Bly started counting how many times it actually cleared the water.  It dove deep and then I was reeling like a madman....fully anticipating a jump and sure enough it cleared the water by about 2 feet.  Then it dove again and once again reeling like a madman to keep up...this time it jumped 3 times in quick succession.  Anyhow, the final count was 9 times!!!  Talk about an adrenaline rush.  Here's the fish....not as pretty as my last one...this was already brown, but still a ton of fun to fight....measured in at 37 3/4 inches...didn't bother to weigh this one....wanted to get it back in the water as soon as possible. "
248450,Moosebunk,2008-09-11 02:51:00,3970,"Great stuff Cliff, and good helpful hints for those not in the know.  Thanks for the report."
248452,Casey123,2008-09-11 02:54:00,461,Awesome fish Cliff!  Where is the nail polish?
248460,solopaddler,2008-09-11 03:14:00,8605,"15 count eh?  What's the matter with you?  (Just joking, nice fish!  )"
248462,Joey,2008-09-11 03:15:00,9122,"Way to go Cliff.  I have never heard of the count thing either.  Do you go 1 mississippi, 2 mississippi, or just 1, 2, 3... ha ha ha!!   Nice size to that one for sure  Joey"
248465,Dondorfish,2008-09-11 03:23:00,1000,Way to go Cliff - but I think something is up!  Don
248466,Greencoachdog,2008-09-11 03:26:00,8163,"Great report pic, and fish Cliff!!!  I thought you were going to say your strategy was to pack up and leave and come back after catching a fish on the first cast!   ... the ol' countdown ploy eh?... I've never heard of it...  ... one thousand one... one thousand two... one thousand three..."
248473,MJL,2008-09-11 03:57:00,2427,"Great catch Cliff  Instead of counting from 1 to 15, try counting down from 15 to 1...You'll get more hits that way"
248474,Ramble,2008-09-11 04:11:00,713,Another nice fish. Good tip as well.  -R-
248475,badboi,2008-09-11 04:46:00,12,"alot of members talk about ""pier"" fishing.... does this refer to the manmade rocks placed at the rivers/mouth edge that people fish from? like at port credit?  I thought piers were sorta like docks......  thanks for the clarification."
248478,SlowPoke,2008-09-11 08:17:00,2984,"I can see a 5 count, even a 10 count but 15?!?!?! Didn't your foot get cold? Nice fish Cliff, sounds like an epic battle! -Brian"
248482,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-11 10:51:00,241,"Nice work dude! That seems like an efficient strategy and I think I'll employ it either this evening or first light tomorrow at the mouth of the Humber! How heavy is the line you are using? I don't want to get spooled and I maybe have 125 yards of 50 lb braid. At the same time, I don't want the fish to snap the line if I try to muscle it in. I've only been out twice trying to land salmon off piers and have yet to actually even get one on so I have zero experience in this realm."
248485,b2kptbo,2008-09-11 10:55:00,1505,"Another good one, thanks for the tips..."
248494,Basskicker,2008-09-11 11:37:00,421,Right on Cliff.....  Jason
248501,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 12:29:00,7971, Hey now!!! I spent 20 minutes photoshopping the nailpolish out only to have you put it back in.
248503,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 12:35:00,7971, Piers are man-made structures that go out into the lake.  Could be made of wood or concrete.  Here's a pic of one I grabbed from the net.....  
248505,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 12:39:00,7971, I'm using 30lb power pro.  The reel I use has a 250 yard capacity with 8lb test (same diameter as 8lb mono).  I'd say you have enough line for most of the fish....just make sure you use your drag properly!  There has been a fish or two though that just runs and runs like I didn't have my drag set....luckily for me both times it spit the hook and they didn't spool me!  I'd suggest using at least a 7 foot medium heavy rod...these fish are powerful!!!
248507,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 12:41:00,7971, Depends on my mood....LOL.
248508,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 12:42:00,7971, LOL....that is too funny Mike.
248509,ccmtcanada,2008-09-11 12:42:00,7971," Ok...maybe I'm slow, but I have no idea what you are talking about...LOL."
248510,Reef Runner,2008-09-11 12:43:00,980,"Nice job Cliff!  I agree, having a good drag system on your reel is key.  Nice catch."
248511,Leecher,2008-09-11 12:43:00,7832,WTG Cliff  She's a real beaut Nice job on the nails there bud Leechman
248529,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-11 13:29:00,0,Nice Salmon.Gotta love Salmon fishing at this time of year when you can catch brutes like that from shore!
248551,fishnsled,2008-09-11 14:20:00,3520,Nice fish Cliff! :thumbsup_anim:I see a pattern developing.....Bly's turn tonight to catch and your turn on the net?
248553,jwl,2008-09-11 14:29:00,1056,"nice fish Cliff, great to see your wife let you catch one this time  ,don't knock that countdown technique either, I do that for steelies and lakers from shore with spoons...it works pretty good"
