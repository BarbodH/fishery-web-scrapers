248535,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-11 13:43:00,0,Very nice! And it sounds like you were at the right spot at the right time. Didn't take long to land your first Salmon of the year! Thanks for sharing.
248541,BillM,2008-09-11 13:56:00,17367,"Who cares why the fish are hitting?  Should we only be fishing for fish that are actually hungry?  If I can disturb a big fish with a lure, and the end result is him smashing it, I win  Reef: Awesome fish bud!"
248585,CLofchik,2008-09-11 16:33:00,854," That spot where Reef was is deep & slow, between the QEW & Lakeshore there's not alot of current and some holes that are deeper than most people think, atleast 12', probably more.  Did well there last year paddling the canoe up casting spoons & body baits.  In the usual Lake O trib there's too many people & not enough depth to really use hardware.  If you find a big deep hole it can work, but there's not many around, and even less without it full of marshmallow plunkers. That stretch of the Credit was nice because it was full of fish and there's little access.    The only salmon meat hunting I do is off a GB trib (tasty fish!), and everyone I open up has eggs in it's gut, sometimes a few bugs.  If they're fresh from the lake they probably haven't had time to eat anything, but they'll still swallow stuff in the river.   It's a hen, they can grow some big fighting teeth on the bottom chompers without the big top kype.  Jeez dontcha know any wimmin's?  They can scrap too! Look at the pic turned the other way, 100% hen. "
248621,The Urban Fisherman,2008-09-11 18:36:00,2050," BillM - Well said.  Reefrunner - Sweet catch buddy, I'm jealous.....stinkin' lake erie tribs....  To the ""complainers"" of the board - give me a break, my 2 year old daughter knows that if you can't say nothin' nice, don't say nothin' at all!  Peace"
248636,solopaddler,2008-09-11 19:22:00,8605," Exactly.  Anyhow, who's to say for sure the fish was lined?, you weren't there StrealHeader. Would you bet your life on it? Not likely. So why the comment?  Once again, congrat's on the fish reefrunner!"
248639,StrealHeader,2008-09-11 19:25:00,56,who said anything about betting my life on it solopaddler.
248643,solopaddler,2008-09-11 19:32:00,8605," It was a figure of speech junior calm down. I said, would you bet your life that the fish was lined? Get it?"
248651,Reef Runner,2008-09-11 19:55:00,980,"Whoa, runaway post, lol.  Thanks for the kind words.  Thank you solo, especially, your response to my post on skein rigging helped me out a bunch.  UB, keep at it buddy!  Hope the family (and expected) is doin' great!  As for stealheader still trying to prove something with relentless posts, guys let it go.  This dude never reported on anything he ever caught, and until then, his comments are just empty words in my opinion.  I really never intended for this post to go in the direction it has.  Let's keep it a family site!"
248805,limeyangler,2008-09-12 05:31:00,5204,Fantastic......well done mate.....that for me would be a fish of a lifetime....thanks for posting.
248975,Bob,2008-09-12 18:16:00,370,"Seems I've been sorely misunderstood.  I wasn't complaining and I wasn't denigrating anyone.  I never suggested that the fish was lined either.  There were questions asked and I merely offered some biological information and suggested reasons why fish will bite even when they're incapable of digesting anything.  I also never suggested that folks should only fish for hungry fish, that's beyond silly.  Since no one cut the fish open to see if it had eggs or milt, the discussion about male female could go on forever.  The length of the jawline, eye position and lack of a pot belly also indicate male to me, even looking at it the other way up."
248446,Bob,2008-09-11 02:30:00,370,"The reason that Pacific salmon die after spawning is that their digestive system completely shuts down before they stage at the river mouth.  They'll still hit a lure from reflex or anger or whatever but they're incapable of really eating anything.  They'll attack a spawn sack and crush it but the thought on that is that they're killing another fish's offspring to give their own more of a chance.  Have you ever pulled in a spawn sack that was still intact but empty and you didn't feel the hit?  The fish has merely crushed it and let go. Sometimes you get lucky and the mesh gets caught on the teeth and the hook happens to turn the right way.  If they're actually on the nest and actively spawning, they'll attack anything that moves too close to the nest and if something actually drifts into the nest, they'll pick it up to move it away.  Bottom line is they're not eating anything.  Open one up and see what's in the stomach, you won't find a thing.  The reason that fish doesn't have a prounounced kype or hook on the jaw is that it's not ripe yet.  Give it a week.  Those teeth are a dead giveaway for a male fish.  They'll get bigger in the next week too."
