433127,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-14 04:34:00,10439,"  Nah, she wasn't robbed. It was very close, they were equal in their turns but the Hannah had better jumps. It is a bummer though. I think we were all expecting Canada's first ever Gold at home."
433128,Mykester,2010-02-14 04:35:00,241,"It was so disheartening to see all those wipeouts in the finals. Even though Hannah stole the gold from us, she was extremely awesome. Also Ammann stole the gold from Malysz in the ski jump, then I was pissed."
433137,BillM,2010-02-14 04:59:00,17367,"I wanted to punch the female reporter in the face who was interviewing her..  Make her feel a little worse for not winning gold, jesus christ..."
