431943,BillM,2010-02-10 21:09:00,17367,Aren't the 'giant' brookies in some of those pics actually splake?  If not... good god.
432035,S.M.05,2010-02-11 00:37:00,145,"dave524 All fish in those picks come from back lakes. Thats a bow not a steelhead and the specs are not nipi. specs although someday I will have the chance to catch some of those beauts.  BillM The three that follow the laker are 2 female splake and one male splake with a kype. The others are specs, first one was a big spring female and the last one was big kyped male which is out there putn the weight on as we speak.  Just have to learn how to catch steelhead now."

432133,dave524,2010-02-11 04:20:00,4508," Sorry, my mistake, I thought the one I quoted looked like a brown with  the spotting initially.  edit : Mike none of the pics were mine , unfortunately."

432292,S.M.05,2010-02-11 18:15:00,145, Your are right the first Fish is a brown. The second fish or first spec is a spec not a splake.
