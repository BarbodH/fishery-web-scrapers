433030,sirfish,2010-02-14 00:19:00,175,"Nice fish KF , but with a quick observation I surmise they were caught on possibly 4 different days ,Yes. Been way to slow down there this year compared to the last few."
433177,knightfisher,2010-02-14 14:39:00,237,"Thanks guys. The fish were caught on different days. The last bow caught this past friday. The bite is off by at least 60%, making for some real tough fishing. Only a few of us dieharts are determined to get out there.  "
