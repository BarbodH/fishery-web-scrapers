432459,solopaddler,2010-02-12 00:58:00,8605,You guys should check this out. I'm posting the link now only after my order was processed LOL! Amazing prices on a lot of different things but especially lures.  Only problem they only ship to the U.S.  I'm fortunate enough to have a buddy in Ohio who I shipped my order to. (As well as another stateside board member who kindly offered. Thanks buddy you know who you are.  )  http://www.overstockbait.com/Default.asp

I've used it for orders from the nflshop, worked out great."
