433244,danbouck,2010-02-14 19:34:00,4380,I was looking for a handheld GPS at the show yesterday and came away empty handed. Today I went to Canadian Tire and found a Magellan Explorist 500LE marked down from $299 to $109   I know I will be happy with this because it is the same one that got stolen out of my truck last year  They have 4 or 5 left if anybody is looking for one.

433249,danbouck,2010-02-14 19:57:00,4380,"ya it has an SD card slot to add maps, you can get a bunch of different maps and the marine one is exactly the same as Navionics Gold"
