432947,Fishing 24/7,2010-02-13 18:23:00,709,Me and steph decided to hit our favourite lake today!  paradice arival. 7:00 am  get the holes done and by 7:20am the lines are set.  a line get pulled and the tip up goes down. slowly. BASS! 8)    as im setting up the minnow.  steph runs and this one is a heavy pull.  a sweet 3 minutes fight of pure BRUTE!  as the pike is ready to go thru the hole....  4...5..6 gator spins and we lose him...... a seriouse 10 +  i kick the tip-up the cheap plastic real brakes and back to fishing ! :shock:  :?  Traumatized steph start jigging with a minnow.  BANG! hard hit. she sets the hook like a b1 master and reels the pig in.  no weight but. HOLY FLOCK of birds.    bass action was on all day.  here one of my cheap windlass.      Then one of many on the side winder spoon.    Still with a minnow tipped on a jig head steph is pulling bass out like a bass master classic 1995!    she would let the minnow drop to the bottom and at the seocnd or even the first lift BOOM BABY BANG! 8)  The bass had ambushed the pike bay cause with that early bite none other were to be seen.  but the bass were big and hungry.    You know you have a big bass when you can hold him by the tail and release him like a musky! :shock:    SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WEAT patern on this pig!    trying to count how many black spots there were on this one..... blacked out after 65.  Then to punish steph for missing the ONLY pike of the day ....i got her to pull the sled up to the car.    PULL. * SLASH* PULL   * WIP*  that will teach her to miss a fish!

432996,Leecher,2010-02-13 22:44:00,7832,You're a mean son of a bassman to let Steph pull that sled like that Sounds like you guys had some fun with the bronze backs.... Congrats to the both of you Some real nice footballs you got into  P.S. check your PM..... I replied yesterday and I won't be home tomorrow cause I'm leaving early in the am..... a couple of hours drive somewhere
433011,S.M.05,2010-02-13 23:20:00,145,Awesome bass though the ice 24/7. Are we gonna see some white fish from you this year?
433017,Whitespinnerbait,2010-02-13 23:40:00,2038,  Just might happen tomorrow...
433023,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-13 23:52:00,0,very nice achigan.
433105,Fishing 24/7,2010-02-14 03:14:00,709,  some say that the lake we fish for white fish isint frozen yet...  i dont know whats going on!  the rain we had here in quebec damadge alot of the lakes.  unsafe ice is nothing to laugh about or risk a life.
433121,splashhopper,2010-02-14 04:25:00,2931,"that would be some serious fun catching those monsters on a 24"" rod..."
433159,solopaddler,2010-02-14 12:47:00,8605,"Wow, impressive! (Just a tip lad, but with valentines day fast approaching you should have pulled the sled....with her in it.  )"

433184,fishyfingers,2010-02-14 15:04:00,46,Very nice!! Puts the lone bass I got on Dog Lake yesterday to shame. Where is this lake?? I am thinking road trip
433228,Curtis,2010-02-14 17:35:00,83,very nice.. those are some big smallmouth i think its safe to say that five of those fish would have weighed in at over 20Lbs!
433345,Fishing 24/7,2010-02-15 01:43:00,709,  you have a good eye!  that lake is godly for smallies and pike...  all over size for some weird reason... must be the NO pressure issue it has!   thanks for the great replies guys.  and for the valentin's thigny.  we dont celebrate such stupidity!
433457,iceslayer,2010-02-15 16:41:00,97,Wow!!  Great job man! I would love to get up that way for a weekend..  WTG!!  Jim
