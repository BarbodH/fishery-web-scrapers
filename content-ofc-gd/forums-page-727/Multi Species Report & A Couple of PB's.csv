433573,carll2,2010-02-15 22:33:00,443,.....another awesome report!!!i know ive said this before but im really jealous that up your way walleye and trout lakes are open all winter!!!!
433580,Leecher,2010-02-15 22:39:00,7832, Thanks Carl!!!  Trout season is closed up here.... but the rest is open.  Only way to go trouting is to go to an outfitter that has a license for hard water and you're good to go..... I used to go to Pourvoirie Pointes des Pins but no longer exist     Had some real nice outings there targetting specks on ice  Thanks again my friend!!! Jacques
433590,carll2,2010-02-15 22:56:00,443,  i was always under the impression that trout and whiteys were open on 31 mile and lake blue sea? gotta check my rules again lol
433597,Leecher,2010-02-15 23:07:00,7832," Yes Carl, whities is open on both lakes til March 31st but when hooking into a laker, must be put back ASAP.   Last year we got into some good laker action but unfortunately had to go back     I think we went 3 - 4 times and myself, only caught a whitie out of a couple of lakers  They seemed to be first on your bait for some bizarre reason    silly lakers"
433268,Leecher,2010-02-14 21:15:00,7832,"Had another go on the hunt for some walleyes at my favorite lake..... the plan was to get there early at sunrise for the morning bite, somehow had a feeling that the bite would be on...... and I wasn't wrong     Left home at 5:30am and made the usual detours for some hot refreshments and gas and the way I go....  Arrived around 6:30am, temp was -6C with winds from the west blowing at 24Km/h   with 79% humidity, all this to say that it was cold LOL..... drilled my first hole and ice was 20"" thick in 8 - 10 fow over a weed bed.  Got another 3 done for my tipups..... First fish to hit the ice was a snot rocket as the sun was rising    Then not too long after that a perch    Some time past before I get another on ice.... snot rocket    and another    Then it got real quiet for a while.  I was beginning to think to call it quits when this jumbo perch hit one of my tipups.... this one is pushing over 13"".... didn't take any measurements but I beat my PB for sure Here's the beast    The next shot is what I used as a studio tripod for the self time shots    And of course..... my setup    Again it went quiet for a while until this 25"" pike decided he wanted the minnow head on my jigging rod.... He wasn't going anywhere cause his mouth was shut with the treble hook in it's mouth    Was real happy with this one so I decide to keep it for the pan.  Then I notice my furthest tipup going down very slowly.... ran to it, grab the line and felt for weight..... was like feeling teeth and small tugs.... then a big tug and I set the hook     What came out of the hole was my new PB walleye... a 20"" golden beauty Here it is    After the photo session and putting on another minnow.... these three decided they wanted to head for cover    That was pretty much it after that cause my goal was achieved and felt satisfied with the results so I call it a day and drove home.  All in all, drove 2 hours, fished for 5 and landed a couple of PBs The set lines were rigged with dead frozen salted minnows and my jigging rod with a buck shot tipped with minnow head. All fish were CPR'd except for these two    Hope you enjoy!!! Leechman"
433276,pike slayer,2010-02-14 21:24:00,1177,sweet right on!!! one thing though?? why do you have your lines so close together and lined up?? myself i usually spread out my lines and move them often if theres no action basically to cover more ground.

433281,Leecher,2010-02-14 21:31:00,7832," Thanks worm dangler!!! Simply because the wind was so bad today, I didn't want to be running around too much and stay close to the car..... plus the holes were getting full of slush every 30 seconds or so with the drifts."
433282,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-14 21:31:00,3761,"Congrad's on the 25"" Pike, the PB Perch and the PB Walleye. I never got out today but tomorrow is looking promising. So anything above 25"" is not a ""snot rocket right""? Lol  Thanks for sharing the report bud, MTBF"
