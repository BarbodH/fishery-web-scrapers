The fishing and company were excellent...many big fish landed including my PB walleye after about 45 minutes of fishing, 10 lbs, 29""....   It took until almost the end of the day, while all the rest of us were hooking, catching, and losing (man I lost a pig!!!!!!!!) Juli, had lost one and missed a few, but nothing out of the hole...until Jamie stepped in and does what a guide does best...coached Juli into catching her PB walleye, 7 1/2 lbs...   What an awesome end to the day...great fishing, awesome company...all the fish landed by us were released...lost a nice eater at the hole, that would have come home with us!!  Big thanks to Jamie and the rest of the G2 crew...a class act all the way. Wish I was out there again today"
