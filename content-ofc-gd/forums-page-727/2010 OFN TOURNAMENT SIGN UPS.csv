423300,redneck666,2010-01-17 20:02:00,563,and bake....
423302,Roy,2010-01-17 20:07:00,13728, So you're not joining?
423303,redneck666,2010-01-17 20:12:00,563,"ive got a few questions for this.... well, one really. would i sitll be able to join up if i dont particularly get out that often? i dont get out to the bigger lakes too often, im more creek fishing and shore fishing at the local locks.  i still have yet to catch one of them damn illusive walleye down at the locks too..."
423306,danbouck,2010-01-17 20:22:00,4380,I'm a captain and can't catch a fish so your answer is yes
423355,redneck666,2010-01-17 22:21:00,563,another bump.........
423405,GBW,2010-01-18 00:11:00,8460,"bigredneck, yes. To all others, you can join even if you only get out a few times a year.  as long as you read the rules and think you can do it then sign up."
423518,SlowPoke,2010-01-18 09:16:00,2984,"The tourney is open to all regitered members. If nothing else, it might get you fishing for species you normally wouldn't fish for. You don't have to have the most submissions, biggest fish or the most combined team inches to win. If the tourney gets you out one more time than last year, you've won!"
423635,Handlebarz,2010-01-18 20:42:00,3790,Brian I might just have to get into it again this year so that we will have something to fight about on the boat like who gets first fish depending on how the reel sound when it starts to scream. And that goes for when we hit lake O this spring I think April sounds great.
423772,PERCHER,2010-01-19 03:36:00,787,You can count me in Brian.
423810,SlowPoke,2010-01-19 09:22:00,2984," ""It's on like Donky Kong!"" Full contact fishing is wayyy more fun than handing the rod over to the guest! As for April, I'm in but my boat won't be ready. We'll have to take yours or show up at Dan's place with a coffee... ""Hey Dan, whatcha up to? We were in the area and thought we'd drop by."""
423958,SlowPoke,2010-01-19 21:24:00,2984,Just a few more participants needed to pick teams. We have all the captains in place. Sign up now!
424005,Handlebarz,2010-01-19 23:22:00,3790,mine will be fine and maybe Deg will join us and show me how to run that thing for kings.  I do have the riggers that you picked up for me have yet to use them so what a better time to try them out

430271,SlowPoke,2010-02-06 18:26:00,2984,"You're optimistic, I have you down for Aug 18 at Noon in the Rizzo pool."
