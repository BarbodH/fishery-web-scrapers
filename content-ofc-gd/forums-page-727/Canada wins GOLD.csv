433364,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-15 03:03:00,3761,Right On Eh!
433365,joonmoon,2010-02-15 03:05:00,528,"That was an awesome run and congrats big time...woooohoooo Gotta feel bad for the dude from France who had the fastest time but missed the difficulty on the second jump, thought he should have got silver or at the very slimmest least bronze."
433367,John Bacon,2010-02-15 03:08:00,3277,"Aside from the gold, the 4th, 5th, & 11th finishers were also Canadian.  The silver medalist was born in Canada but compets for Australia.  Four out of the top five finishers plus the 11th place being Canada is quite impressive as well."

433390,Cudz,2010-02-15 04:35:00,2652,"Great run and a well deserved gold for Bolideau but I can't help but wonder if we are ever going to find a better way judge sports that are not timed.  I really wish we did not have to that subjective opinion involved in a result.  Anyway, it was a great day for Canada."
