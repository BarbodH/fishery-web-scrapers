433098,idesign,2010-02-14 02:53:00,149,I have got GMC W3500 turbo diesel cube van.It has speed limiter.The max i can go i 110 KM/H.Is there any way to disable it.The reason is i travel from Toronto to Ottawa.And it is so annoying.When i go little uphill the speed decreases to about 80 KM/H.The tractor trailers goes more faster then me.I don't want to speed but when i am going uphill i want to maintain my speed.I cannot even over take any body.Tractor trailer over takes me.I talked to some1 and he said speed limiter is set in transmission computer.You need some kind of programmer to re programme that.So does any1 know any way and can tell me where i can get rid of this problem.Pls let me know.thank you
