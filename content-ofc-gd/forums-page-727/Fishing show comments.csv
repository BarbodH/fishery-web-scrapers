433631,cram,2010-02-15 23:59:00,1733,"Just returned from the fishing show, and wanted to share a few comments.....  1 - thank you TJ for the free ticket.   Much appreciated.  2 - learned a bunch about carp fishing from a guy who i believe may have been hammercarp?  Is your name Lorne?  If so, i was the bald guy in the dark grey sweater.  Thanks for the advice...i'm going to try it out this summer.  3 - was able to pick up a manta glide bait at JB's (?).  I have not seen mantas anywhere else....that alone was worth the trip.  4  - of the *new gear* being sold at the show, the only one that looked really useful to me was a line cutter that you afix to your rod instead of using a knife/scissors/nail-cutters - zip cut pro.   Looked pretty good .  I picked up 3 of them.  5 - also picked up some kangaroo and camel sausage....only at shows like this will you see that stuff.  Can't wait to try iit.  6 - Pete Maina is quite the character.   Very entertaining.  Had really hoped to catch Jim Saric as well, but timing didn't work out.  Maybe next year."

433633,hammercarp,2010-02-16 00:06:00,964,Yup. That was me. If you have any other questions about carp ask away. 
433636,cram,2010-02-16 00:10:00,1733, I wondered after the fact.   Thanks again for the advice.  Visit my in-laws cottage once or twice a summer and usually see a bunch of carp.  Tried for them once with a mixture of cornmeal and crab-apple jellly rolled up into balls.  (obviously) didn't know what i was doing....  Will try again this summer armed with what you taught me today.
433646,hammercarp,2010-02-16 00:22:00,964,I hope you get some real drag burners! Can't wait for the pictures.
433687,cram,2010-02-16 01:50:00,1733,just tried the kangaroo sausauge and it was awesome.
433693,Stern Rules,2010-02-16 01:59:00,342,I tried a sample of both the kangaroo and camel pepperettes and I think I liked the camel better so I bought those ones. Kangaroo burgers are really good. I haven't eaten my camel burgers yet. This was the first time I noticed those pepperettes at the show. They've had alligator before but it was hot so you couldn't tell what it was. Still good though.
