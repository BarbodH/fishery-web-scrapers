387716,HUKDONFAWNIX,2009-09-28 16:29:00,135,Just thinking about the upcoming ice fishing season and I am looking for opinions.........Should I go to Nippissing or Temagami this year?  We will be fishing for Pickerel.  Thank you in advance for your help.
387722,Terry,2009-09-28 16:40:00,14456,you have a much better chance of getting pickerel on Nip  unless you get a good guide for Temagami
390067,walleyemaster,2009-10-05 00:14:00,325,No Way Temagami all the way..lots of walleye there winter summer and fall...dont be fooled terry
390084,Terry,2009-10-05 00:44:00,14456,Well I can't catch the dang things  wish I could
390132,johnnyb,2009-10-05 01:31:00,3413,"BOTH!!!  Head up to Temagami, and either get there early, fish for the day, then roll down to Nip for the evening bite...or stay in a hotel and hit Nip the next day"
390151,irishfield,2009-10-05 01:58:00,26272,There's no fish in Temagami...
391344,walleyemaster,2009-10-08 21:33:00,325,yah if your terry...sorry terry i had to say it
391348,Terry,2009-10-08 21:36:00,14456,"hell, I can't argue that point  LO   But I am willing to learn"
391481,fishhunter,2009-10-09 11:56:00,604,I second that!!!
391608,curlrap,2009-10-09 21:03:00,58,"Fishing sucked last winter on nippising, in are area anyway (from mouth of the french to goose island)."
433066,Terry,2010-02-14 01:56:00,14456,so what do I look for to find them walleye
433072,irishfield,2010-02-14 02:00:00,26272, 
433073,Terry,2010-02-14 02:03:00,14456,hell I had to try
433076,irishfield,2010-02-14 02:05:00,26272,You know where we can pull them up out of 70 FOW in the middle of the day.. but that's not the answer when they're in the slot!  Don't worry Terry... we'll have fun even if you don't get one!! Have a few spots in mind.. many actually...
433130,walleyemaster,2010-02-14 04:40:00,325, how many???? ya think that spots are gonna really help terry???
433196,danbouck,2010-02-14 15:39:00,4380, exactly
