432740,solopaddler,2010-02-12 20:45:00,8605,"Seems like every time I find a lure that I really like, a lure that actually catches fish, it gets discontinued.  The Minnow Rap wasn't out that long, but what a great lure. Similar to the Shad Rap but a longer more stretched out profile. I've caught tons of fish on these things, for me they're money in the bank. The #9 and #11 model in the purpledescent colour are lethal on walleye.    If I'd known in adavance I would have grabbed what I needed when they were still readily available. They're still available at a few places online and ebay, but I suspect supplies are limited.  If anyone knows of a source for the purple ones in #9 & #11 sizes in Canada drop me a line. I'll be eternally grateful."
432743,EC1,2010-02-12 21:02:00,930,"Can't help you find one, because I've never bought one of these in the first place. But my mom did find one in perch colour on the ground during a fishing trip though!  Never really caught me any fish though. Only snagged a huge carp in the back with it  I would also say take a look inside the Lebaron stores. There always seems to be a pile of discontinued crankbaits on sale, although the selection is very limited."
432747,skeeter,2010-02-12 21:19:00,1907,are these also called deep tail dancers????
432752,solopaddler,2010-02-12 21:43:00,8605," Nope, the tail dancer is different. It's a banana shaped bait with a more erratic action. Good lure as well though.    As mentioned it's called the Rapala Minnow Rap."
432754,pike slayer,2010-02-12 21:52:00,1177,http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/prod...mp;merchID=4006  what do i win!?!?
432755,jace,2010-02-12 22:01:00,472,"   unless the US is now a canadian province, you win nothing."
432756,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-12 22:04:00,2690,"LMAO!!!!   Come on guys, read the post properly"
432758,archie_james_c,2010-02-12 22:06:00,618,its still listed on their site  And yes it is known as an excellent Walleye bait...never used one personally but everyone seems to think they rock!
432767,solopaddler,2010-02-12 22:45:00,8605,          They do rock.

432769,adempsey,2010-02-12 22:50:00,1498,"Not sure if this helps, but I did see some Minnow Raps in the bargain bins at some of the exhibitors at the Fishing and Boating show today.  I have no clue what colors, nor do I recall if there were a lot.   Not sure if you are headed there or not this weekend, but best of luck!"
432782,archie_james_c,2010-02-12 23:54:00,618,Like I said though...the site still has them on there. Where did you hear they were discontinued?
432784,solopaddler,2010-02-13 00:02:00,8605," Thanks, not the right colour though.    Thanks for the heads up.    There's been chatter on the net for some time about it. Pretty much every online retailer is either blowing them out at reduced prices (I missed Cabelas big sale ),  or in some cases jacking up the price on their remaining ones. There's a couple of Stateside online retailers that have what I want but that's a last resort."
432785,archie_james_c,2010-02-13 00:04:00,618,  I know Cabelas blew them out the door @ like 2.50$ or something stupid....
432848,xeon,2010-02-13 05:03:00,350,"Well, time to find another fish magnet. Rapala is bringing out new lures left and right, I'd expect to see some decent ones this summer to replace what they discontinued."

433235,Steve,2010-02-14 18:43:00,2075,"as mentioned above, the fishing show had a discount retailer with 3 colours. hot chub, purpledescent, and some brown one.  five dollars flat.  i bought 5 of them, but they still had a few more...definitely will be gone by today though, unless the guy 'restocks' himself.  i got the scoop. balsa baits cost more to make than plastic injection mould - and they plan to phase out all balsa baits...they have already started some of their J11 and J13 to plastic."
433252,solopaddler,2010-02-14 20:02:00,8605," Sign of the times, that's really too bad."
433309,Paully,2010-02-14 23:14:00,712,Last summer me and a buddy caught 7 walleye in a half an hour off some locks in buckhorn on these. Best walleye fishin in a long time..
433374,skeeter,2010-02-15 03:30:00,1907,"thats funny. i stopped by the rapala booth on saturday at the show to ask them about it and the guy working the booth said, "" there not discountinued, thats one of the top sellers. look its listed in our new cataloge"" but then again he's not the only booth attendent at the show that didnt know what he was talking about !!!! thats another story that is way to funny. but i dont think i should post it .---maybe i should, i know there would be a lot of laughs over it..."
433400,adempsey,2010-02-15 05:53:00,1498," Sounds like a business opportunity to me =)  Although, the brand new Rapala Trolls-To and Flat Rap lure series are made of balsa.  So, not sure if that statement is true or not?"
433406,solopaddler,2010-02-15 12:32:00,8605, The Trolls-To looks decent I have high hopes for it.
