432770,smitter,2010-02-12 22:50:00,106,"Is it necessary, I say no.  If you have dedicated reels for ice fishing it can be nice though."
432928,scugpg,2010-02-13 16:39:00,1373,For me I'm always outside never in a hut...at least for this year.  Do you guys use swivels for panfishing and walleye?  What lb of florocarbon do you use?  I've tried the Berkley micro ice and it seemed ok.  I tried the Gamma co-polymyer 4lb and it seems to be terrible. Freezes up and not supple enough.  Wondering about trying the Berkley micro ice braid or the p-line at this point.
433132,walleyemaster,2010-02-14 04:43:00,325,i never use ice lines..i use 6lb for all my rods summer winter fall....
433163,wkrp,2010-02-14 12:53:00,656,I am using the new Power Pro Ice Line  10LB test with a flourocarbon leader and think its great . No more curlys blowing in the wind.
420643,Spiel,2010-01-10 13:22:00,9065,"   Another ""ditto"" here. Been using XT for many years on the ice, no issues. Have also used braid succesfully when in the warmth of my portable."
420656,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-10 13:55:00,0,"any ""ice line"" that isn't just a mono is garbage.  fireline, braids, all that stuff looks and feels like dental floss more than line.  on my one rod i have berkley XT and it's fine if it's not colder than about -10.  if you start getting into -20's and -30's i find regular mono freezes up really bad, loses it's limpness, and then my line starts to show up on the vex.  i find the berkley trilene ice or berkley trilene coldweather mono to work much better once it's real cold."
420661,Handlebarz,2010-01-10 14:07:00,3790,"I use the Berkley Trilene Micro Ice in 4 and 6 lb, for ice fishing I will have a good spro swivel with a lead of 6lbs floro to help prevent line twists when using the rapala jigging minnows the reason I like the ice line is that its BLUE that is the only reason I use it a couple years ago I was using cajin red for the same reason I can see my line as I jig this way I can see the light bite before I feel it if my line slacks any bit at all I set the hook. For me its all about being able to see the line and for the panfish I will use the 1lbs line on a very lite rod."
420900,Fisherpete,2010-01-11 00:09:00,1814,"I have tried many of the ""ice lines"", and there are mixed results:  Berkley Micro Ice - very good. Fairly cheap too, and I like the blue. I use 4 lb or 6lb on several of my setups.  P-Line Fluoroclear - AWESOME. Not the straight fluorocarbon version, but the fluorocarbon coated mono - it is my fave ice line, but I can't find any 2 or 4lb test this year... Only 6lb, so that is on my trout/whitey setups. If anyone knows where I can get some in 2 or 4, please let me know!  Berkley Fireline Ice - You can feel everything, but MUST use in a heated hut or you are wasting your time. Expensive too.  Powerpro Ice - Again, you can feel everything, but MUST use in a heated hut or you are wasting your time. Really pricey.  I also have good ol' regular Trilene XT or XL on a few rods - 4lb test - works just about as well as the ice mono..."
420910,solopaddler,2010-01-11 00:33:00,8605,"Trilene XT and XL are no brainers for me as well. Have to admit though I've been running 11.9lb Tectan on my dead stick rods the last couple years. Love it, stays amazingly limp even in super cold weather. Contrary to most I've also been using 10lb Power Pro on my jigging rods. Spray some of this stuff on your reel the night before, let it soak in and dry, and you're good to go.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  (I used to use ""Reel Magic"" but was recently turned on to this product and used it steelheading the last time out. It really works. It's not marketed as a de-icer but it makes your line hydrophobic. Spray it on your guides as well to reduce ice up)."
420952,Dabluz,2010-01-11 01:54:00,701, Wow....a Tectan user.  I love that mono too.  Quite expensive because I have to order it from Europe or the U.S.  I have been using 3 lb Tectan Premium for brook trout fishing in the summer....haven't used it for winter fishing yet and it is very fine.  It may not be as strong as other 3 lb test monos but it is finer (feels and looks like 2 lb mono) thus this means that the company does not sell you 3 lb line that is the size of 4 or 5 lb test line and say that it's super tough.  Stren does that.  They sell 8 lb mono that is the same size as the 10 lb mono other companies make and then claim it's the strongest mono on the market.  I would like to use Stren Original Clear mono but it is an inconsistent line....the diameter and strength varies throughout it's length.  That's why it is not expensive.
420987,fishnsled,2010-01-11 02:42:00,3520," Ended up on Quinte today, Miss Smith didn't not brave the -17 temps today.  lol!  Stayed outside all day, didn't use the portable at all as it wasn't windy in the morning and that sun sure felt nice.  I was tempted when those winds picked up out of the west though.  Slow bite for us, a few perch and no walleye.  As for the lines The mono was very stiff and fell off the reel.  Once the bait was down it was fine.  The flouro I was using was Seaguar AbrazX.  It did not go stiff like the mono did, fished with it all day with no problems.  Ended up putting the mono away because I just like how the flouro was working.  No problem with hookset and getting those might perch up the hole.   Looking forward to trying it out on some whities and lakers and see how it holds up then.    Yep mono doesn't like -17.    Great tip!"
421050,EC1,2010-01-11 07:22:00,930," Ahh, nice. I, on the other hand stayed inside the hut for practically the entire day to stay away from the cold and freezing lines.  And to report my findings on P-Line Floroice in 4#, I have very mixed feelings about it. First off, I loved the fact that it didn't turn into a slinky even at the end of the day. The line was very supple, and didn't make any loops even when I was reeling line in carelessly. BUT, for some reason I had this line snap on me on 2 hooksets(?) I may have put the line in contact with the heater, but I'm pretty sure that I didn't. Glad I didn't lose tackle from it, as I was lucky enough to grab the line just before the fish swam away and actually caught 1 of those 2 fish on the broken line  I believe I will be trying that line out ONCE more before I decide to keep it or throw it away, and might try the reel magic if I do make a trip out to BPS."

421104,Vanselena,2010-01-11 16:06:00,269,For Lakers and Whitefish I use braid with a floro leader open air in - whatever degrees. For perch no braid but use 2lb florocarbon.  Trick with braid is to run your line over a block of beeswax and you are good to go.
421172,Eazy,2010-01-11 17:33:00,260,"I do use super-lines for jigging..........The Bekeley one i find is the best for not icing up, because, techically, it's not a ""braid"".."

432618,cheaptackle,2010-02-12 13:27:00,849,"I have to echo the braid with flouro leader and agree that in the open the braid does ice up.  This year I'm using the lightest braid (not ""ice"" braid), PP 1-8 & 2-10 in red with about 24"" 10lb flouro leader.  I only go in huts so icing isn't a problem.  Don't know if I'm catching more or less as a result but I'm not unhappy with the performance of the lines (yet??).  One thing I do like about the red is I can immediately see if the line goes sideways at all in the hole (usually healthy bait but sometimes...)  I'm not sure if this is just because it's the first time I've tried it so I'm maybe paying more attention, but I feel pretty comfortable with it (isn't 90% of this sport your own comfort zone?).  Figured I'd try this setup so I can use the reels & lines on my ultra light rods in the soft water season too - might as well maximize the mileage! Michael"
432622,John the Fisherman,2010-02-12 13:49:00,45,"I have been using Spiderwire ""Mono"" 8lb for some years now on the ice.  It stands up to the abuses of getting caught on little pieces of ice around the hole, and is excellent for hook setting because of the lack of stretchiness.  I use this line for all spieces around Temagami.  Lakers, walleye, pike, specks.  It stays limber on cold days, and does not ice up too bad. There are some pretty crappy lines out there for sure, some come off a spool like a spring as soon as you flip the bail, and end up in a big mess.  Others are just too big in diameter for the smaller spools on ice rods. It works for me quite well, but it still takes a sharp hook to get the best out of your line. JTF"
432674,Dabluz,2010-02-12 16:26:00,701," I would like to use fluorocarbon lines in order to have a line that may be less visible to fish but all the ones that I have used so far (Vanish 6 lb test, Vanish leader material 15 lb test, Seaguar leader material 25 lb test)  do exactly what yours did.....simply snap well under their test rating.  All within the first hour of use."
432683,MCTFisher9120,2010-02-12 17:13:00,3761,"To fix my comment from before...Fireline Crystal is garbage. I've now switched to P-Line Fluoroclear(4lb) and it has worked great...except when I caught that 31"" Pike, she stretched a few yards of line. That with my 15lb Fluoro leader and I have no problem's catching pike. On Tip-Ups I use 12lb mono with the same leader material."
432689,Tybo,2010-02-12 17:36:00,1373,p-line fluoroclear here also. I have had it on a couple of reals for a 2 seasons with out a problem.4lb and 8lb.

432742,EC1,2010-02-12 21:00:00,930," I kind of have mixed feelings about this now. Lots of people say it is marketing, but at the same time I believe that the ice line really works. I used sufix elite on my very first ice fishing trip (and I loved it so very much during softwater), but it was absolutely terrible on the ice! Then I bought myself some actual ice line and found that it works much better, and after some line conditioner, the line works almost as well as sufix would during softwater."

420438,EC1,2010-01-09 19:52:00,930,"Good Afternoon everyone! Hope you guys have started your ice fishing / softwater adventures for the weekend!  I just had a quick question for everyone that is ice fishing. Is there really a need for ice line, or what type of line could I get away with? I used Sufix Elite in 6lb last weekend, and that line has pretty much turned into a slinky. Would ice line actually stay supple even in the extreme cold? I just wanted to make sure before I go spend anymroe money on ice fishing.  Thanks In Advance!"
420440,redneck666,2010-01-09 19:58:00,563,"good question, i got 4lb trilene spooled onto my ice rod, but i havent used it yet. and i have a full spool of 8lb trilene extra tough. so, who knows. thats the line i rely on my whole softwater season! it works fantastic and i hope it holds up when i finally get out on the ice!"
420461,EC1,2010-01-09 21:20:00,930,"Thanks Bigredneck. I am a little weary for using summer lines, but I don't know if I can get away without buying ice line, that's all.  No tips from anyone else? What does everyone else put on their reels on the ice?"

420488,s2k4mee,2010-01-09 23:02:00,73,"i tried powerpro ice today.  Can't say i love it.  It still has the tendency to freeze while jigging, albeit less than regular braid.  My suggestion, stay away from braid for hard water."
420491,pike slayer,2010-01-09 23:10:00,1177,"i find just regular monos work great, i think ice lines arent much different, in fact i find them to be pretty crappy, i've tried a few different brands and so far they all suck. im gonna stick with my regular summer mono hasnt failed me yet and isnt to bad for ice build up, no worse then ice lines."

420544,Dara,2010-01-10 01:41:00,3052,"I use 20 lb trilene wrapped around a board. I hang it off of a limber willow gad cut from the side of the trail on the way in to the lake. I use a 10 lb snelled hook hanging off the flasher. I change the line out about every 5 years.  When the hole ices over I stomp my heel in it to break the line loose and re-open the hole. Thats why I use 20 lb...it can take the beating of winter fishing and bouncing around in a sleigh.  The fish I catch specs, lakers and eyes don't seem to care. I have been ice fishing for 40 years now and I think somebody started calling it ice line about 2 years ago so people would buy special line for winter fishing.  I wouldn't use 6 or 8 lb line in winter. You get a decent fish rubbing it against the side of a hole and you may go home pretty depressed."
420553,pike slayer,2010-01-10 02:09:00,1177,i do pretty well the exact same setup as dara but i change my line every year and i put lighter 8-10lb on a jigging rod when i feel like jiggin. hasnt failed me yet.

420628,Dabluz,2010-01-10 06:19:00,701,"I hate fluorocarbon of any sort.  All of the independant tests on the internet say that it is just as elastic as most monos, is not more abrasion resistant than most other monos and it sure has terrible knot strength and shock resistance.  It's also stiffer than most other monos.  If I'm just using some whippy branches that I cut on the way to some distant lakes for walleye and pike, I use rather large mono (15 to 20 lbs) and a finer leader of mono for the walleye or 12 lb 54 strand steel leader material that is about the size of 4 lb mono (expensive stuff) for pike.  I use the large main line because it is a hand line.  For cod, flounder, halibut in 300 to 600 feet of water many years ago, I used to use 100 lb test mono as a hand line because of the stretch factor.  With a large trolling reel and rod, I use 30 lb test braid now.  For places where there are just walleye and I'm using a rod and reel, I use 6 lb good quality mono ...like Sensithin (no longer exists).  Ice line....that dark blue mono ice line....plain junk.  It may be ok where it's -20 or -30 but the water is nowhere near that temperature.  It's way too elastic and soft.  It even is thicker than ordinary mono of the same lb test.  Fluorocarbon and co-polymer lines....have always disappointed me.  I tried 25 and 15lb test fluorocarbon leader material (Vanish and Seaguar) and it was terrible.  Luckily, I had won those spools in a contest so I did not waste any money.  However, I'm glad when I see fishermen using fluorocarbon line....it means more fish for me.  Sure...ice builds up on the line.  If the line is old....the build up is worse.  New slick lines have less build up.  In any event, it takes a second to push it down the line into the hole where it softens up.  Ice on the rod tip is another problem.  I prefer using the thin titanium rod tips but I don't mind removing the ice on the rod tips....it's part of icefishing.  It only happens when you reel in fish and you let the water freeze up."
