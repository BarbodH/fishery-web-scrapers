432901,Daplumma,2010-02-13 15:27:00,1961,"Arrived late afternoon,unpacked and laid out my weapons of choice.Had very limited space so I took very few lures.  Headed for the beach,the tide was in and very high..no fish the first day.  The next morning I tied on a white twister tail and first cast.I caught many more of these all about the same size.  The twister also caught these other fish.Puffer  and this guy,who lost all of his color as soon as I landed him.  I traded a small spoon for a Sabiki rig from a native and modified it to cast easier,making two rigs out of one.  One morning I was throwing a crankbait and snagged a trash can lid sized stingray.I thought he was gonna spool me twice.I finally got him in close and he got loose.Glad it happened that way.Also got a 18 inch Bonita but did not have my camera that day. Here are some wildlife shots    Costa Rica is one of the prettiest,cleanest places I have ever visited.We were on the Pacific coast so the water was not Carribian like and had volcanic black bits in the sand.It was very hot 95 F most days.The local economy is in pretty good shape and going off the compound was not scary at all and not as touristy as most places.

432904,Spiel,2010-02-13 15:37:00,9065,"Shouldn't you be up on the roof.  Looks like a good time Joe, guess it sucks to come home to all that snow!  I gotta ask if you know what this guy is? Looks like some sort of Grouper.  "
432909,oxcowboy,2010-02-13 15:49:00,544,"looks like a great time joe, glad you got into some fish, it's always fun to catch new and exotic species.  Did your body go into shock when you arrived home to the cold and snow?  jason"
432922,lew,2010-02-13 16:18:00,12766," Joe, I think your biggest problem here was you were casting to the wrong spot. Pretty sure you shoulda been aiming for the water rather than the trees  Other than that, welcome home bud, it sounds like an excellent vacation."
432923,Daplumma,2010-02-13 16:21:00,1961,"It is some sort of Grouper Chris but not sure what its name is. This is what I got to return home to.Oh almost forgot,one of my furnaces fan motor went out and the new motor wont be in until next Tuesday.      Joe"

432926,TJQ,2010-02-13 16:26:00,7806,"Awesome, im gonna get there someday.. i liked the first set of pics better.. lol."
432927,SlowPoke,2010-02-13 16:37:00,2984,"No pic's from your layover in Atlanta? Nice shots Joe! Yikes, that's more snow than we've had here all season!"
432929,Spiel,2010-02-13 16:43:00,9065,Well the pitch on the main roof looks self cleaning and judging by this picture....    ....someone has already been up ther shoveling. At least it's a low pitch and easy to walk on. None the less be careful and don't hurt your back.
432952,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-13 19:29:00,4399,Timely report Joe the wife just booked a week at the Barcelo Langosta in CR today and I just might take a rod down with me. Tell me do you know if you need a license to fish the shore?
432966,steverowbotham,2010-02-13 21:01:00,1800,awesome!  I fished the Gulf side two years ago and had a blast!  I would love to go back to Costa Rica
432970,Rich Clemens,2010-02-13 21:27:00,3131,Quite the contrast in the North and South pics Joe.   Glad ya had a great time and thanks for sharing with us.
432971,Daplumma,2010-02-13 21:29:00,1961,"Dont know if you do but no one said BOO to me.I don't think that anyone would because the tourism dollar is appreciated.If I recall correctly you dont need a license to fish salt water here.Looks like you are also on the Pacific side.Have fun,bring your pole and Sabiki rig.Some sinkers,small hooks and a trip to the local bait shop may be fun also. Joe"
