433358,JohnF,2010-02-15 02:39:00,3494, If I was working nights or whatever shift during which an event is finishing I think I'd like to leave the radio off and hope to be able to enjoy the excitement on PVR or whatever. I plan to record some hockey games and hopefully no one will spoil those results for me. Kinda sux to sit thru a game when you know how it finishes.  JF
