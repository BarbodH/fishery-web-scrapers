431502,asdve23rveavwa,2010-02-09 19:34:00,2690,That should be hanging on a wall...too beautiful to actually use as a lure...nice!!
431505,uglyfish,2010-02-09 19:38:00,981,absolutely amazing!!
431506,Fang,2010-02-09 19:39:00,1330,"oh my, oh my my my  my bidding finger is getting real itchy. I have a small 8"" desk top muskie they did a number of years ago. Advanced is definitely in a class by their own."
431509,Terry,2010-02-09 19:46:00,14456,wow I just might catch a muskie with that thing
431510,TJQ,2010-02-09 19:47:00,7806,I forgot this picture...  
431512,Dara,2010-02-09 19:53:00,3052,Could you imagine that with Muskie tooth marks all over it.
431513,TJQ,2010-02-09 19:54:00,7806,  A crime that would be!!
431540,mbac31,2010-02-09 20:34:00,904,I've actually inquired  for  them to paint some custom lures. I will see them at the show to see if they still can. Hope he says yes.
431542,kickingfrog,2010-02-09 20:36:00,8333,"Are you aloud to use a walleye lure that is in the slot???  My mouth started to water just looking at that lure... little salt, pepper and a lemon wedge mmmmmm."
431550,walleyejigger,2010-02-09 20:47:00,876,WOW! that is very impressive
431593,ohhenrygsr,2010-02-09 21:49:00,947,Wow the Detail is amazing
431600,fish_fishburn,2010-02-09 22:05:00,1311,Thats one hot lure lure. Should call it the Underwood.
431601,smitter,2010-02-09 22:06:00,106,That looks like a skin mount!  Beautiful!
431609,canadadude,2010-02-09 22:34:00,769,"The boys at advance taxidermy are true artists, if anybody wants a mount made these are the dudes to get your work done. not only will you get an unbeleivable recreation of your fish you'll also have a piece of art"
431703,outllaw,2010-02-10 02:15:00,1232,beauty artwork. its for wall hanging. its not designed to run. the lip and screw angle are wrong. . definatly an amazing piece
431816,JPD,2010-02-10 14:46:00,296,"This is one of the examples of a limited edition set that the boys are producing to support a great cause for Shawn's son Chase. They will be creating 10 numbered lures in 6 different designs... they will be Walleye (as seen) blue walleye, bluegill, smallmouth, largemouth and perch.  For the collector that loves limited edition fishing related goodies and a great cause this is all of that. I don't think these will last too long once they get them going.  JP"
431872,fish-miester,2010-02-10 17:58:00,864,WOW those are amazing
432194,Fish4Eyes,2010-02-11 14:12:00,1022,"One of them in a 2-3"" size would be a sweet key chain."
432200,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-11 14:35:00,0, I'm pretty sure a custom paint job will cost the same as a custom replica. Minus the lure itself which isnt much. Sean has had a few ideas of lure making over the years but lure maknig is not a great business.   I hope he does well for Chase.
432951,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-13 19:22:00,0,Sadly didn't see any a the show.
432962,bassman,2010-02-13 20:35:00,384,I think it was auctioned off for app. $1000
433240,Guest gbfisher,2010-02-14 19:21:00,0,Not until march 27th.
