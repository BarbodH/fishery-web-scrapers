433080,Tinman,2010-02-14 02:09:00,376,Got the phone call i was dreading today. My grandmother had a stroke 2 weeks ago and seemed on the mend. My uncle called today and told me she had passed at aroun 12 pm. The toughest part was calling my dad on his cruise and giving him the bad news. She was 86. God bless Grandma.

433123,splashhopper,2010-02-14 04:27:00,2931,"Prayers from London,ON.   The Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi   Lord, make me an instrument of your peace, Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy;  O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love.  For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life."
