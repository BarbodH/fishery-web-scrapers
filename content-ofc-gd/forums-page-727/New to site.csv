As of last year it was my first time fishing, but i have owned some of the people I have fished with. I have already recieved certificates for big fish! and have had a wide variety of experiences in types of fishing including; casting, ice fishing, drifting etc... I'm looking forward to trying/seeing new things. This gives me a chance to learn something new everyday and meet new people"
