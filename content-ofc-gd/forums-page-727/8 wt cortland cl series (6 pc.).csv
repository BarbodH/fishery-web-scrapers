433541,spinnerdoc,2010-02-15 21:36:00,556,picked one up today and feels nice to me. nice action to it. i'll be using it for pike and bass mainly. fairly new to fly fishing and my first rod was a 4pc quantum fly rod so it is quite a jump. lookin to get into fly fishing more this year so i thought investing in a better rod would be a wise thing....so what do you think
