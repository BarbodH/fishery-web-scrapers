167577,ketchenany,2008-03-05 00:27:00,3229,"I just saw this on the Discovery Channel, what an amazing machine. Great toy for those that have it all. According to Harry Hainey it's for safety. The man is very mechanically inclined to say the least.  http://www.snow-boat.com/sb/"
167579,irishfield,2008-03-05 00:29:00,26272,Man would that be fun.... stuck in 16 inches of slush....  Wonder what's acceptable for patent buy out?
167582,Clampet,2008-03-05 00:33:00,1947,"The abscence of any video suggests it may not handle the rough ""seas"" or like Irish said, 6"" of slush.  I'd love to see that thing in action."
167587,ketchenany,2008-03-05 00:40:00,3229,"Sorry Clamp-it, on the web site there is a link to ""movies and pictures"" that show the machine in trials. I saw it carrying 5 people.  Irish, according to Harry, he has sent information to manufactures but so far no taker."
167590,Clampet,2008-03-05 00:51:00,1947,"Found the links. It seems like a compromise, between a sled and a boat, where neither is a benefit.  I can see some lawsuits coming."
167592,Terry,2008-03-05 00:54:00,14456,"gee, I like my idea of a snowmobile with a pair of pontoon floats at just the right position"
167595,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-05 01:03:00,1351,"im sorry, i dont really like it... u gots a snowmobile with a tub around it.. then when you get into the water, you gotta go put down and start up your outboard, once you pop out of the water(even more of a pain if the pond/water is only a small area) you gotta shut off your outboard and tilt it back up so the skeg won't hit the floor...?  im confused..."
167596,irishfield,2008-03-05 01:05:00,26272,Perfect platform for the Merc 9.9 Pro Kicker with electric start and tilt !
167598,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-05 01:06:00,1351,"you see the motor go flying, almost breaking off when the 'boat' finally got out of the water... http://www.snow-boat.com/sb/movies/snowboat_sagbay.mpg  don't want to sound negative... just some criticism so they may improve their product..."
167601,Casey123,2008-03-05 01:13:00,461,"That could possibly be the stupidest invention I have ever seen.  Reminds me of a boat-car from the 1960's, we all know how well that one did."
167672,KyleM,2008-03-05 02:46:00,218,"I second that, thats extremely dumb.  You could easily snap a leg on that thing when you come off your machine.  Been there, done that, dont plan on doing it again.   I wonder if I could jump it?"
167685,Mike the Pike,2008-03-05 03:02:00,3421,See it for yourself tonight it will be on Discovery channel at 11PM and I think 7am wednesday.  It looks pretty solid
167687,irishfield,2008-03-05 03:05:00,26272,  Many said the same thing about Mr. Bombardier as well...  And the amphi-car... my buddies got three of them. Think he got the entire production run ! LOL
167693,Casey123,2008-03-05 03:09:00,461, And the prototype
167694,irishfield,2008-03-05 03:09:00,26272, 
167790,Kerry,2008-03-05 15:00:00,383," Your buddy wouldn't happen to be Gord from Orillia would it Wayne? I have a Panther and it is a trail sled(real heavy for a fan cool) more than a lake sled and 6"" of slush is enough to slow you down considerably.If it's upgraded with a 1 1/2"" paddle track at least that'll help you float and move.Would have a lot of fun doing drive and suspension associated bearings though every other week being constantly submerged. Kerry"
167793,pikehunter,2008-03-05 15:06:00,1659,"A novel idea. I'm sure there are others in the planning stages as we watched the video. With more trials and thought it could work.  I don't cherish the idea of traveling over ice, no matter how thick it may be so maybe chickenpoops like me would entertain the idea of venturing out in a similar craft?  I still get a kick out of how this site self censors itself   Ha ha...chickenpoops"
167803,irishfield,2008-03-05 15:31:00,26272, You got it Kerry...
167866,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-05 19:44:00,2585," I have seen one that had inflatable floats that acted like pontoons, pull the tab and they blow up on each side of the snowmachine or atv.  WOnder why it never took off?  Cheers!"
