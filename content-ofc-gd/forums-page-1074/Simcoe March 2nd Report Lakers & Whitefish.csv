I say ""ok"" because it was double digit hookups the day before I was told.  Fished away from ""The Compound"" by about 200 yards and managed some rod bending action Whitefish & Lake Trout. Met up with some old friends and made some new ones.  Fished in 83-87 FOW and used Meegs (""mean green"") and Williams Whitefish with Blue holographic tape.   Heres one of my buddy Casey and PB laker thru ice    Group shot with Sly   Can't wait for more this week as I feel a flu coming on.  Sly can be reached @705 437 7880."
