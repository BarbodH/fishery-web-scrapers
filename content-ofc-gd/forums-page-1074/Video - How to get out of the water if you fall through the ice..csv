Watching this may save your life if you should ever fall through the ice. <br><br> <object width=""320"" height=""240""><param name=""movie"" value="" <br><br> Play safe everyone!!!"

In my area, there are quite a few drownings during the winter.  The video has important information for those who witness someone going through the ice.  There are no statistics on how many people go through the ice and are quickly rescued by friends or people nearby."
