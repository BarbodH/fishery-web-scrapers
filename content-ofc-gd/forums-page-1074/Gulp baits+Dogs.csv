167557,Rustic-Fisher,2008-03-04 23:35:00,826,Bought a bunch of gulp baits on the weekend and found that not only do they out fish live bait but also are extremely effective in coaxing dogs into feasting on the  unopened packages of bait.( my fault for leaving them out) 4 packs of gobys. Vet says what goes in will come out LOL. A reminder for myself to watch what I leave laying around. the guilty    RF
167561,aplumma,2008-03-04 23:50:00,6896,yup I reconize that look on their faces I had a beagle eat a small jar of mentholated vasoline once. Put her outside all day and brought her in just before bed. As soon as the lights were out a fart noise sounded from the hall and it was alittle more than a noise. The bad news was the dog wanted to see were the noise was coming from and went in a circle lookin for it. 30 min. with a carpet cleaner was my reward for that blunder.  Art

167578,Burtess,2008-03-05 00:28:00,901,"I have a boxer as well and the one ""fishing"" related item he has eaten (amoung roasts, steaks, numerous cat toosie rolls, chocolate truffels, etc...) is a brand new bottle of trout Dr. Juice....  Burt"

167606,Fang,2008-03-05 01:19:00,1330,best beagle story yet  gotta luv em. My guy ate something last week and painted the inside of his kennel.
167618,shane,2008-03-05 01:33:00,652,Love the dog stories!  My lab once ate one of my work socks.  I found it a couple days later coiled up in the back yard.  I could have washed it out and still used it!  But I didn't.
167625,eyeforelle,2008-03-05 01:44:00,38,good job ryan  .
167642,Rustic-Fisher,2008-03-05 02:11:00,826,"LOL.... Can't stay mad at them. Come trout season the boxers hobby is eating roe bag netting found at home or on the river bank. Drives me nuts worrying about ingested hooks from the river bank but so far so good. The netting does make for a colorful clean up in the back yard though, LOL..  RF"

167735,mart,2008-03-05 12:17:00,93,The look on those boxers are priceless!! They don't look guilty to me.... I guess GULP can catch almost anything. Good story and pics!!!
167819,Rustic-Fisher,2008-03-05 16:10:00,826,"Actually the big 120 lber is a Cane corso, The boxer breed in general is a natural comic and clown and seems to do anything for a laugh,(cant even tell ya the amount of trouble he's got in LOL) The big guy, well he's all business. One of them or some times both are with me on the rivers I Float fish  or the odd ice fishing excursion. Just keep your gulp baits close if ya ever see them running around. The boxer has also been known to steal a fish or two!!!  RF"
