A bound hard or soft cover book can be created, and what you have is a product that looks like something that appears on a bookstore shelf.  First thought was that I could make one of these for my fishing photos.  She said you download a program and do all the laying out yourself and send it to them through the internet.  The company is an american company and she said they have been very good to deal with.  The prices are pretty decent aswell.  I am sure there are a few companies that offer this type of product.  I have the company and the link available.  I hope this not qualify as spam, and if everyone is okay I can add the link to this message."
