168050,irishfield,2008-03-06 02:59:00,26272,I imagine it would have been a rink yesterday.. just like Midland Harbour was... but we got 10 inches of snow last night...
168094,motv8tr,2008-03-06 08:25:00,2587,"Kevin, you might have some traction, but it's always a good idea to have some cleats with you just in case  Wow Wayne, you got a lot more snow that I did, on this side of the Bay there was maybe 5 inches at best....ok maybe 6  Maureen"
168113,tinbanger,2008-03-06 11:52:00,1028,"6+ inches of snow on top of glare ice ...slippery ...you bet .  That and the 15-25 more cm of snow predicted has changed my plans to 'drive' out for whities on Saturday ,maybe walk out at BBP .  Kevin - I'll call you tonight so I can drop off your auction item on friday ?  TB"
168125,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-06 12:46:00,1351,and off i goooooooo
168151,irishfield,2008-03-06 13:44:00,26272, Happens all the time Maureen.. I've had 18 inches on my runway when my buddy had a dusting on his over on Champlain Rd. We get a direct hit from the gap between Beausilea(sp) Island and the main land... off the lake... as our house is the very first high ground after the lake in a North wind.  I may have also measured the drifts this time... but I had over a foot at the back door (the part that counts as I have to shovel it by hand!) and at least 7 inches in the laneway..
168195,cityfisher,2008-03-06 15:35:00,959,guys have been driving out on cooks for a while.. If you have 4wd and dont mind driving on the ice:) ive seen lots of little sunfires on the ice also !
