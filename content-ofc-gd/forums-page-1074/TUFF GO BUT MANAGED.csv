167900,dsn,2008-03-05 21:24:00,1018, Wow I'm surprised lampreys still exists. I haven't seen amy in years.  dsn
167982,Joeytier,2008-03-06 00:51:00,3990,You obviously don't fish Lake Ontario very much... They're extremely common on Salmon.  I see Chinooks with 2 lampreys on them at the same time quite often.
