167555,Roy,2008-03-04 23:30:00,13728,"Starts at midnight tonight here and ends tomorrow evening. 25cms in the forcast. Excuse me, I have to go hide the shovel."
167562,Greencoachdog,2008-03-04 23:54:00,8163,"I guess Cliff is sick of posting weather reports. We got our share of that storm from midnight last night 'til about 10:00 a.m. this morning, nothing real heavy but a real ""frog strangler"" of a rain. Water level should be up on Lake Henry for a couple of days!!!"
