167812,irishfield,2008-03-05 15:47:00,26272,"Kinda limits your choice in beer... doesn't it !  Glass I've always undertood... but cans at least rust away vs plastic never decomposing. Ideally everything comes back out.. that goes in, but we know that doesn't happen with a good number of canoers/campers."
167816,Stoty,2008-03-05 15:59:00,2910,"Hahah, it sure does!  Yes, I agree, its a shame that people cant be responsible enough to clean up after themselves. I am proud to say, I am not one of those people! I leave my campsites the way they looked when I arrived. Sometimes they look better when I leave because of ignorant campers before me!"
167873,Stoty,2008-03-05 20:02:00,2910,"Received another email from a guy saying Sec Lake (and area) has great bass and pike fishing. Has anyone ever been there?  How big are the bass/pike that you caught?  We are looking for some decent fish (4 lbs + bass), (10 lb + pike)"
167878,irishfield,2008-03-05 20:18:00,26272,Remind me to never PM you a fishing spot Stoty !
167882,Stoty,2008-03-05 20:34:00,2910,"I am not giving away anyones spots.....they are well-known lakes.  Thats like me saying Lake Ontario is a good spot for trout. Thats not giving away a spot.  I just want to get input as to what lakes to go, since I am a newbie when it comes to interior Algonquin trips."
168002,holdfast,2008-03-06 01:38:00,1813," Hey, is that the same Island where that young couple got eaten?  That was an interesting story, seems the Warden looked for them, got to the Island, found the Canoe, their groceries untouched but not them.  Thats when he called in the OPP and found a grisly discovery"
168032,johnnyb,2008-03-06 02:36:00,3413,"Well, here is a link to a page of topo maps for the park: www.fedpubs.com/mpchrt/maps/algonquin.htm Also, if you go here: http://www.scribd.com/doc/8488/algonquin-park-map , you can see a PDF of the whole park and it's canoe routes.  This particular map used to be easier to find on the web, but this was the only site I could locate it on. As for the fishing in Happy Isle, we covered the shoreline from the opening of the bay leading into Adrienne Lake, toward the first campsite across from the island, and did quite well with the smallies.  Green tube jig tossed out to deeper water nailed a beautiful 3+ lber.  From the looks of the lake though, any of the steeply dropping shorelines would produce...easy fishing. I think that was on Burnt Island....my buddy never shuts up about it...very difficult to get him to camp on islands now."
168059,Stoty,2008-03-06 03:23:00,2910,"Thanks for the reply. I have it narrowed down to 3 spots, just want everyone opinion which is the best for 1) decent sized fish 2) least amount of traffic.  Spots:  Happy Isle/Merchant/Redrock Lakes Sec/Wet/Little Sec Lakes Shall/Booth/Farm/Crotch Lakes"
168144,Cookslav,2008-03-06 13:33:00,1457,"LOL...  As long as the folks who PM'd you feel the same way Im sure its all good They may be some of the more well known lakes but.... They did ""PM"" you right?  No biggy I s'pose   Ya beer in Plastic bottle options are Steelback, ummm SteelBack, and ummm oh Ya Steelback LOL!!! The Nut brown Ale is Nice though...I was not a fan of the strong it was like Schlitz, AKA Paint thinner, and the Silver was like American beer, or like John Cleese says ""making Love in a canoe""  Its F-ing close to water (no offense to the m'ericans) "
168157,BillM,2008-03-06 13:54:00,17367,"My dad used to bring 'beer balls' when we'd go to the park.   2-3 gallons of Old Mill never hurt anyone  The only thing we ever caught in Opeongo was Lake trout (This was 15+ years ago), we'd spend most of our day fishing the little river off Annie's Bay for brookies.  The island we always stayed on was just outside of Annie's Bay.  It was extremely small, not even an acre in size..."
168159,Stoty,2008-03-06 13:59:00,2910," Ha ha ha, amen!"
167304,Stoty,2008-03-04 13:41:00,2910,"Thanks jnic, but I am going to try out Happy Isle Lake, its a lot closer than the east gate is to me. I would prefer a lake that doesn't allow motors though. Less noise, less fishing pressure."
167306,Stoty,2008-03-04 13:43:00,2910,"I forgot to ask about the wild animals around the Happy Isle Lake area. Should we be on the lookout for bears, wolves, etc? Should we hang out food from tree's?  (As you can see, I have never been to the interior of Algonquin Park before, LOL)"
167419,dannyboy,2008-03-04 19:13:00,367,"We hang our food barrel a little way from camp just out of habit any time we camp or canoe. No food or anything involved with food in the tent as a precaution. Keep you camp clean of any dropped food.  As for wildlife in Algonquin there are bears, moose, deer, wolves and other assorted animals, other than raccoons we have never been bothered. There have been bear and wolf attacks but they are rare.  Like anything else in life be cautious but not paranoid.  We keep an eye out but more for the privilege of seeing the animals in their natural environment.  Dan"
167698,Cookslav,2008-03-05 03:15:00,1457," 2 questions I can answer.... Number one....yes!!! Absolutely, and take lots of pic...we love to see them!  Number Two....If your on the island I say No, if your on the mainland I say Yes, unless you want a coon, squirrel, skunk, or what ever else into your food, and ripping holes in your gear.  Bears are plenty in the Park, and not overly shy, but if you can be bear ""smart"" you'll be fine. Common sence goes a long way"
167701,BillM,2008-03-05 03:20:00,17367,We used to camp out on an island on Lake Opeongo when I was a kid.  Had a moose and her calf swim over to the island one night.  That was a sight to see!
167703,Stoty,2008-03-05 03:30:00,2910,"Ya, better safe than sorry I say. In hockey, I could hold my own, but come face to face with a bear....I think I might be on the loosing end of that fight!  Actually what we were planning on doing was taking just the essentials, with minimal food basically keeping a few fish a day for food. (some canned goods just in case the fish dont co-operate)  Would I have to hang canned goods up?  (Don't laugh, I am new to the interior thing!)"
167758,Cookslav,2008-03-05 14:00:00,1457,Ah...theres an issue my friend.  No Glass or cans allowed in the park. You'll need to put your food into Plastic....its a pain but thems the rules
167761,Stoty,2008-03-05 14:08:00,2910,"Oh shoot, I didnt realize I couldn't have cans in there. My bad! Alrighty, so food in the trees it is! ha ha ha.  Thanks for pointing that out!   I just got an email from another guy saying that the Access Point #17 (Shall, Booth, Farm, and Crotch Lakes) is an excellent spot for pike/bass/lake trout with minimal portaging.  Which area would be better for us? (for decent fish, and the least amount of traffic)  Happy Isle/Merchant/Redrock or Shall/Booth/Farm/Crotch"
165129,Stoty,2008-02-27 17:37:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  Just wondering if anyone has done some interior camping inside Algonquin Park recently (2007)? I have always wanted to go into the interior just brining the essentials (tent, cooking gear, fishing gear, bathroom items) and basically live on what I catch for a few days.  I am looking for a low-pressured lake that hold a healthy supply of Smallie's. Not only would I like to keep a few for dinner, but also looking for a decent chance at getting a nice big fish as well to beat me PB of 5lb 9oz.  Any help or insight as to where I can find info on the interior lakes of Algonquin would be greatly appreciated.   Cheers, *Stoty"
165147,dannyboy,2008-02-27 18:16:00,367,"Stoty: You can catch smallies pretty much everywhere in Algonquin, beaver lodges almost guaranty a couple, they can get a little wormy in warmer weather though. For eating you may want to target Lake Trout which require gear that will get down deep unless you go in the spring when the trout are near the surface. Be sure to bring along some food in case the weather gets nasty or the fish aren't biting - to get to the interior of the park requires you to portage which burns lots of energy. I don't know your level of canoe experience but if this your first trip I wouldn't recommend going solo.  Lots of information here: Canadian Canoe Routes  Dan  ps: since when are 'bathroom items' essential gear on a canoe trip?"
165158,bbog,2008-02-27 18:26:00,665, My thoughts exactly!
165189,Stoty,2008-02-27 19:11:00,2910,Ever since I went on a trip without toilet paper!!!
165212,solopaddler,2008-02-27 19:42:00,8605," I've done numerous lengthy canoe trips from 1 to 4 months long where every single piece of gear is weighed and scrutinized before it goes in the pack. Toilet paper is a luxury I learned to live without. Trust me it's possible to do without.  As far as your question goes pretty much all of the large lakes along the hwy 60 corridor have good smallmouth. Interior lakes that stick out in my mind are Happy Isle, one portage away from Opeongo's N/W arm, and Radiant a widening of the Pettawawa River downstream from Cedar Lake.  Algonquin is generally known for numbers of smallmouth although you will catch some nice ones. Best place in the world IMO for trophy smallmouth and incredible flatwater canoeing is Quetico park west of Thunder Bay. Totally blows the doors off Algonquin if that's what you're after. In my younger years I travelled twice to Atikokan by Greyhound bus from Toronto and rented a canoe  when I arrived to fish Quetico. Where there's a will there's a way."
165221,irishfield,2008-02-27 19:53:00,26272,So that's why you wear brown boxers.....
165225,Stoty,2008-02-27 19:59:00,2910,"HA HA HA, brown boxers....but for the few grams it weighs...I am going to pack it!"
165231,solopaddler,2008-02-27 20:08:00,8605," It is possible to do without, and no my boxers were'nt brown  .  Should have said that any trips of a more ""normal"" length, toilet paper is always in my pack."
165233,Terry,2008-02-27 20:12:00,14456,"yeah but  getting "" it "" out of your finger nails after using your hand to wipe is tough  I would be taking paper"
165243,Stoty,2008-02-27 20:28:00,2910,"HA HA HA  Ya, the trip that I am looking to go out would be 4 days MAX. Probably a Thursday - Sunday type of thing."
165248,irishfield,2008-02-27 20:45:00,26272,Ahhh.. you can hold it that long Stoty!
165254,Stoty,2008-02-27 20:52:00,2910,depends if I run into a bear or not..........
165342,johnnyb,2008-02-28 00:31:00,3413,"I was also going to mention Happy Isle Lake....plentiful and co-operative smallies, with a good chance at some really nice sized ones.  Easy back lakes to get into from there as well, if you bring your lake trout tackle as well.  And yes, Canadian Canoe Routes is definitely worth checking out. Brown boxers.  Ha!"
165348,holdfast,2008-02-28 00:46:00,1813,"If you go to the east gate in the petawawa side you will not run to as many citIdiots.  Not too far from the East gate you can drive right to the Petawawa River where it widens known as McManus Lake.  Huge Musky and Pickeral.  Tons of cats at Night, and a chance to catch a trophy Smallmouth.  Drive further up and you have Grand Lake in Achray.  Lots of bass on the many lakes.  One Portage and your probably alone unless its a long weeknd."
165500,Stoty,2008-02-28 14:03:00,2910,"Thanks for the info everyone, much appreciated!  Where is the east gate of the park located? I am looking at google maps right now, and I dont see a main road that enters on the east side of the park.  Cheers, *Stoty"
165516,singingdog,2008-02-28 14:52:00,1047,The East gate is where Hiway 60 exits the park on the east (go figure) side.
165517,Stoty,2008-02-28 14:55:00,2910,"I assume you mean Whitney?  Also, are there any gates to get into the north end of the park?"
165519,dannyboy,2008-02-28 15:01:00,367,"Stoty: If you PM me your e-mail I can send you an Alogonquin map in PDF.  It has the access points, lakes and portages on it, it is a bit older and some of the portages have changed but will give you a general idea.  Dan"
165631,Stoty,2008-02-28 19:54:00,2910,PM sent.  Thanks!!
165721,Casey123,2008-02-28 23:28:00,461,"Citidiots,  I like that, I may just use that at some point down the road."
165777,holdfast,2008-02-29 01:38:00,1813,"My Mistake, what I meant was the Sand lake gate just south of highway 17.  Thanks for the correction Singingdog.  The road is also known as Achray road,  McManus lake is a drop point for portageing the Petawawa River.  If you PM me I can put you on to the Muskie hole, where the Lake Narrows, but dont tell anyone, Its just a stones throw inside the Military boundry.  shhhh"
165922,Stoty,2008-02-29 14:05:00,2910,"I just Google mapped Achray road, and it seems to end at highway 17, but there is another road called Baron Canyon Rd (hwy 28) that pretty much intersects Highway 17 where Achray Road ends, that leads right into the park. I am assuming thats the road your talking about?  Go on Google maps, and look where Highway 17 crosses Highway 26. Thats where Achray Rd ends, and Baron Canyon Rd starts. Is that the road you're talking about?  Thanks again."
166143,holdfast,2008-03-01 02:34:00,1813,"Yup, they must of changed the name again.  Achray, Barron Canyon or whatever is one main road that goes through Sand lake Gate,  Most of us call it the east gate since its East.  Just a tip, the Baron River for some reason does not have the quality and Quantity of fish as the Petawawa River.  It could be because there is heavier fishing pressure at the Black Bay Area historically.  If you want Brookies, there is a stream(Travers Cr) that runs Parallel to the road and RR Tracks and the fishing holes are just before you get to the Observatory.  What I did was waded downstream from a washed out bridge that once crossed the stream"
166361,Stoty,2008-03-01 22:06:00,2910,"Nice, thanks.  I just picked up the ""Backroad Mapbook"" of the Algonquin Area, and am doing my reserach as to where we are going to go. What I have been reading though, is that there doesnt seem to be smallies up in the North Western end of the park (North Tea Lake area). I was looking at that side, because its the closest area to me in Pickering.  I think that I might have to make the extra drive, and go in the east side."
166366,Corey,2008-03-01 22:31:00,355,"I haven't done any camping in there yet, hopefully soon though."
