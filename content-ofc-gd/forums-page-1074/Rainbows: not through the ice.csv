167329,bucktail,2008-03-04 14:56:00,1857,I am amazed you found enough open water that was slow enough to drift! Good going!

167751,Mike Pike,2008-03-05 13:19:00,1332,"Nice job on that beauty Bow and the jig!  Must be really satisfying to not only hook into fish like that with the conditions at this time of year, but to be able to trick 'em with something you tied yourself.. well that's like the icing on the cake.  Thanks for the post and pics!"
