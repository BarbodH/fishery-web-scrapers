167851,bowshep,2008-03-05 18:49:00,378,Have a great trip... it looks like a blast.  Ken
167889,ShaunB,2008-03-05 21:00:00,73,mmmm  I can taste the rum already...one more sleep...have a good time buddy
167896,scuro,2008-03-05 21:10:00,386,"Major piece of advice here...determine the tide...http://tbone.biol.sc.edu/tide/index.html. The ocean facing beaches will be sandy...the shore facing shore will have more flats and structure to fish. Scout for structure during low tide. You can fish a beach but look for the break in the shoreline. For many fish the best time is as the tide is going out...the first few hours. Where there is structure and water moving out...there are predators. Make sure you use leaders, silver and white work best, forget black. Work everything fast...even surface lures."
167933,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-05 23:24:00,1183,"Have a great holiday..relax, wear sunscreen...take off the rings before going into the ocean.  I was there 18 years ago...if you see something shiny, well you will see lots of that on the ocean floor...could be a wedding band we lost...and if you see skin dangling off a low hanging branch, that would be from my ex's forehead.  hahaha And if you run into Katherine and Joe, please say hello from Nancy. And if you take a horseback ride into the mountains...wave to both the white and black witch.  Enjoy"
167937,highdrifter,2008-03-05 23:33:00,2534," If you're staying at an all inclusif resort and alcohol is included, ask for Barcello if you're partial to run and cocas!!  Also, if you get the chance, ask about a quick tour to the cigar shop in Don Lucas.  Not only do they have an insane walk in humidor, they've got all kinds of nectar!  yyeeeeeee  mmmmmm  I can't wait to get home.  Gonna need a good one after today!"
167953,Daplumma,2008-03-05 23:48:00,1961,"Thanx guys,Shaun where are you staying?We will be at the Iberostar Bavaro Resort. Joe"
167975,ranger520vx,2008-03-06 00:33:00,164,We stayed at Grand Palladium Bavaro. Go down towards where ALL the charter boats leave from and see who is catching. $90.00 walk on rate for 5 hours or so. Other option is to rent small motorboat and fish the reefs out from beach.
167189,Daplumma,2008-03-04 01:43:00,1961,"I am headed to The Dominican Republic this Thursday for a week.I did a search and read the posts and am wondering if anyone has any more input.I am taking a medium spinning set up and a small  assortment of jigs,spoons,plastics and crankbaits.Any other suggestions for things to do there? Joe"
167193,Whopper,2008-03-04 01:45:00,2174,Have fun Joe!
167198,Golfisher,2008-03-04 01:54:00,586,"You will see mostly European vacationers there, and that means two things: lots of topless women walking around the beach, vitatiated by an equal number of fat dudes walking around in speedos!  The Lord giveth with one hand and taketh with the other."
167199,Stoty,2008-03-04 01:56:00,2910,"I was just there in Sept, and saw numerous fish cruising up and down the beach. A nice spinning rod with a jig, should do you well!"
167208,Crazyhook,2008-03-04 02:19:00,1154,"white bucktail jigs ( they catch everything from snapper to jacks to cudas), Raza spooks, chug bugs, Xraps!  catch em up man!!"
167210,lew,2008-03-04 02:33:00,12767,My wife just got back from there 2 weeks ago Joe and really enjoyed herself. Fabulous weather and beautiful beaches and she said the people were unbelievably friendly.  Have a great trip !!
167213,Nanook,2008-03-04 02:41:00,565," We were there many years ago Joe ! You will have fun and enjoyment, Just dont drink the water LOL"
167214,irishfield,2008-03-04 02:43:00,26272,No ice in your JD either....  Have fun bud... just enjoy the scenery and fish when you get home!
167218,highdrifter,2008-03-04 03:05:00,2534,"Actually just got back from DR last Saturday..  Stayed at the Grand Oasis, which is a great hotel.  Beach was 5 star, but the fishable water was pretty nil.  Purchased a 3 piece st-croix specifically for the trip, thinking I might find some fishable water.  Apparently, it is forbidden to develop beaches, so I thought I'd find some great flats.  I did find some flats, but anything you'll see inside the breakwall, is tiny.  Funny thing, I did see a local catch a moray eel and a small ray from one of the docs, but everything else was basically bait...  My advice would be to book a charter for deep sea fishing.  BOOK THROUGH THE HOTEL.  I made the mistake of booking through a local outfitter, and needless to say, we're lucky to have escaped with our lives.  Send me a PM if you require any more info.  Have a great trip either way!  cheers HD"
167220,Joey,2008-03-04 03:11:00,9122,Enjoy and take lots of pics.  And don't drink the cocktails if the ice cubes don't have holes in them.  Hepatitis is a queen.  Joey
167222,ShaunB,2008-03-04 03:16:00,73,flying out thursday too...is your flight around 5?
167239,Mike the Pike,2008-03-04 04:17:00,3421, Just bring us back a card full of fish pics
167289,Daplumma,2008-03-04 12:53:00,1961,"Thanks for all of the replies.I have already packed my speedo so I should fit right in!I will be very careful about what I drink.Shaun,my flight leaves at 8 am from Dulles airport. Joe"
167294,Greencoachdog,2008-03-04 13:12:00,8163,"Don't eat the BBQ monkey meat on a stick... even if it smells good!  The dark rum is good and will work for washing out wounds should you happen to step on a Sting Ray or Hardhead Catfish while wading.  You'll be sorry if you touch the pretty blue and pink ballons floating on the water (Portugese Man of Wars).  Tarpon and Snook around the lights at night. Snook, Mangrove Snapper, and 'Cudas around the Mangrove Islands during the day. Snook, 'Cudas, and Lookdowns around bridge pilings. Scoop Peeler Crabs off of seawalls with a small net for Bonefish and Permit.  No hanky panky on the beach without a blanket... sand is not good ""down there""!  If you hear deep toned cello music while swimming, get out of the water FAST!!!"
167297,Bernie,2008-03-04 13:20:00,3190,Have yourself a fine time Joe.
167298,TJQ,2008-03-04 13:21:00,7806,Have a blast!!

167312,perodimi,2008-03-04 13:59:00,124,"Just as a side note, there has been a Malaria outbreak there for a number of years. Make sure you bring lots of mosquito repellent and check out these government websites if you're concerned:  http://www.voyage.gc.ca/dest/report-en.asp?country=77000  http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/2008/mal_dr080206-eng.php  Remember you'll have to check it in because of the liquid ban on carry on luggage.  Many travellers from Canada don't realize that Malaria exists in the Dominican Republic and travel agents are reluctant to give you the heads up in fear of scaring away business. It's certainly good to know though. I don't know whether the anti-malaria medication is over kill or not. You have to take that two weeks in advance of your trip anyways so too late for that regardless. Your Doctor could advise you on that if you're concerned. The resorts are generally okay because they routinely spray but if you're going off property to go fishing for example, protect yourself for sure.  I don't mean to rain on your parade but I thought you may like to know. It's a great place and you'll have a great time.  Cheers,  Peter"
167317,Spiel,2008-03-04 14:15:00,9065,....Y'all have a blast and be safe.
167331,Chrispy,2008-03-04 15:00:00,168,"Hey Joe, go to one of the many kitchens at your resort and get them to give you some shrimp.....I watched a guy 2 years ago on the beach catching 2-3 pound fish (don't know what they were??) but he was having a blast all by himself.....I walked up to him and asked what he was using and he told me that the kitchen staff gave him some shrimps and bread.....he threw the bread out first which attracted smaller fish and then the bigger ones came in and took the shrimp.....you could hear this guy laughing to himself a mile away!!!  LOL!!!  Have a great time!!!  Have a couple Cuba Libre for me!!!!   Chrispy!"
167548,Daplumma,2008-03-04 23:15:00,1961,Tons of great advice here.Am I the only one who has not been there?I'll post pics when I get back. Joe

167733,Roy,2008-03-05 11:43:00,13728,"You have yourself a great time, Joe. Be safe and take lots of pics. I'm sure that Glen will ""look after"" your goats while you're gone."
167752,Guidofisherman,2008-03-05 13:19:00,206,"I was there a few weeks ago. The Bavaro beach is very long and beautiful and the water warm, but has very little structure. The reef is well off shore so you are better going on a charter. For tours, I did the ""Reef Explorer"" to snorkle with the rays and sharks, not the party boat version. Cost ~ $80. Good food, service, drinks and great weather. Here  are a few underwater shots and the parrot's claws did pinch the skin but that is what the rum was for. Enjoy!    "
