167365,Joey,2008-03-04 15:50:00,9122,Now that's funny Terry!!
167374,ccmtcanada,2008-03-04 16:24:00,7971,LOL Terry...now THAT is hilarious!!!  Congrats on the big fish....
167477,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-04 20:59:00,1183,"Nice pics of everyone...but I wasn't able to see where the video was...anyhow, doesn't matter.  Thanks for sharing."
167631,mistyriver1,2008-03-05 01:55:00,600,Guess I missed the video Joey.  Congrats on a great day.  You guys had some great company  Terry LOL
167699,nelly,2008-03-05 03:17:00,256,Joey consider yourself lucky. I have never had a whitefish on. My buddy and I spent one whole night in  a small hut in 90 feet of water with nothing.
167187,Joey,2008-03-04 01:40:00,9122,"We had the pleasure of fishing with Shelley, Chuck and Terry on Saturday, and Emil too.  The wind was ferocious and it was bleeding cold.  I have never caught a whitefish before and was pretty hopeful, but I only managed to get two on, but lost them halfway up     Better than nothing I suppose (although that's what I ended up with, nothing   ).  Anyhoo, I snapped some pics of the day and a video of Chuck catching a pretty big whitie.  Thought I'd post them so Chuck, Shelley or Terry can copy and paste their photos if they want.             Cheers,  Joey"
167192,Roy,2008-03-04 01:45:00,13728,Thanks for that Joey. That video is super too. Congrats to everyone.
167195,irishfield,2008-03-04 01:47:00,26272,Terry caught a fish... terry caught a fish!  Thanks hun !
167197,LeXXington,2008-03-04 01:52:00,1928,"Cool pics, great video.. Thanks"
167200,Terry,2008-03-04 01:58:00,14456,Terry caught a fish  Terry caught a fish wow oh wait that's me  you can sure hear that wind in the video  as always I enjoy fishing with you guys but I still think it weird how we keep showing up at the same place and the same time
167201,medmart,2008-03-04 01:59:00,587,Nice looking fish WTG guys  rob
167203,Rustic-Fisher,2008-03-04 02:12:00,826,"Nice pics, wind was bad that day, Movie makes it look like the whitie was snagged in the side though. That could generate some heat.  Tight lines, Rustic"
167206,irishfield,2008-03-04 02:17:00,26272,Never believe what you see at the movies.......
167211,Rustic-Fisher,2008-03-04 02:34:00,826,"Hahaha, Just kinda looked and sounded that way on the clip.  Some movies are based on true story's though.......  either way it is a deceiving clip.   Rf"
167215,ccmtcanada,2008-03-04 02:44:00,7971,Great report Joey!  Your time is coming...I'm sure you'll get one next weekend!  Congrats to everyone...some real nice fish!
167216,Joey,2008-03-04 03:00:00,9122,"The whitie was not snagged in the side, the line was wrapped around the fish in the ensuing fight, and when Paul pulled it out of the hole the lure came out of its mouth and stuck in the fishes side.  Sheesh, can fishing not just be about fishing without every little thing getting picked apart  And yes Terry, are you beginning to feel stalked  Joey"
167229,trapshooter,2008-03-04 03:43:00,1234,Cool report Joey.  Hopefully you get another chance with the whities this year.
167231,Mike the Pike,2008-03-04 03:48:00,3421,WTG folks nice whities the sound of the wind tells how cold it truly was.
167259,Chuck Best,2008-03-04 09:26:00,308,"Thx. for posting that Joey,Hope you get a chance a another one.....Maybe not this weekend,but the 15th for sure.......TC and tight lines..........Chuck......."
167262,Guest skeeter99,2008-03-04 10:10:00,0,"not trying to be a ass or nothing  but I watched the video several times and the fish appears as if it was foul hooked?  the spoon was clearly not in his yap when first came out of hole, maybe when gaffed it came off and got stuck in his rear as you can see in the video   just a observation, I was not there  but a nice big whitey to say the least"
167263,solopaddler,2008-03-04 10:31:00,8605,That was great Joey! Congrat's to everyone  .
167264,bowshep,2008-03-04 10:44:00,378,"Glad you got out Joey, you will get your fish.  Ken"
167282,iceguy,2008-03-04 12:33:00,341,Nice Video. Great fishing in Slyville. Hopfully we'll on top of them at now being plan March 15 Meet and greet.
167292,ccmtcanada,2008-03-04 13:09:00,7971,  Did you not read her explanation???   No need to further explain Joey...your word is good enough for me.
167302,TJQ,2008-03-04 13:24:00,7806,Great stuff guys.. Joey.. be patient....  I haven't caught a fish in years.....
167305,Cory,2008-03-04 13:42:00,170,I think they should ban all fishing pictures and videos on this site.  Just leads to bickering
167307,Terry,2008-03-04 13:45:00,14456,"they could photoshop them so you only see the backgrounds and no people or fish but when the fish first hit the hole it was hooked in the mouth  it isn't as nice but it works  here is with person and fish       and here is without...not much to argue here...LOL      <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=terr.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/terr.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
167333,irishfield,2008-03-04 15:08:00,26272,Can you put the fish back in the second shot to make the overall view prettier than the first shot!
167345,Terry,2008-03-04 15:30:00,14456,ah..picture perfect
