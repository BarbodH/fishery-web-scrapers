167001,TJQ,2008-03-03 17:04:00,7806,"It was time for a quick trip up to Jiggy... get the snow off the roofs, do some exploring and see if we could catch a fish or two.    Lotsa snow around the tent...    Fishied right out front with no luck...    Dug the tent out....    Ahhh hot wings after a long day!!    The smaller tent is getting buried!!!    On Saturday, we took a trip into a lake that I had visited in the summer... we thought there would be a trail broken with lots of fishermen going in.. When we got to the trail going in there.. it looked like no one had been in all winter... what an adventure that was.. all sorts of fluffy snow to play in.    Some beautiful cliffs on the lake.      Some neat water falls... frozen!    Even the beavers are getting restless this time of year.     Gotta watch the creeks!!    We even managed to bring in a Sat receiver and watched the UFC fights from Bed on sat nite~!!!!      What a great weekend... alot of work getting in and out for a couple of days though.. lol.. that much time on the skidoo's and I am some sore this morning...."
167005,Cookslav,2008-03-03 17:11:00,1457,"looks like a fun Time....nothing beats the winter blues like getting out and exploreing a bit on the sleds To bad the fish were not cooperating, Maybe next time!"
167008,Cory,2008-03-03 17:12:00,170,"""We even managed to bring in a Sat receiver and watched the UFC fights from Bed on sat nite~!!!!""  Next time bring Monique and you won't have to cuddle up to Tookie"

167253,Bernie,2008-03-04 05:03:00,3190,"TJ, I know how you feel about the place. It's beautiful. Good stuff! Feels good to get up there doesn't it. Lots more snow up that way. Does the watershed from there go into Nipissing? Hope it does because there isn't enough snow around here to bring the lake up in the spring."
167257,Mike the Pike,2008-03-04 05:27:00,3421,Looks like a good time sheesh satelite TV in the middle of nowhere.  I know you didn't catch fish cause it looks like you peed in the first hold you drilled
