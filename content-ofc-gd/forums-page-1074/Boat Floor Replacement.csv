167339,wmshaw,2008-03-04 15:21:00,42,Does anyone know of a shop that could replace the flooring in my boat with marine plywood  I have a 17 foot crestliner and the front area is getting very soft and spongy.  I do not have the facilities to do it myself and need to find a reputable shop to do the work.  Any suggestions?  Bill

I ended up spending about $300 on plywood carpet, ss screws and bolts, marine carpet, and the carpet glue.  The project took 3 days but that was during the 3 hottest days of last summer.  I'd say I really only worked on it for about 3 to 4 hours a day.  It was discerning doing it, but possible to do it yourself.  I would definitely do it again.  If I need to have the rest of the boat done I will be doing it myself.  Try it.  I have photo's I can up load if you like.  Entropy"
