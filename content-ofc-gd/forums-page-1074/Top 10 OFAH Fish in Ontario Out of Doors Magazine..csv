Makes me mad when I hear crap like this.It takes away from peoples accomplishments with real trophy fish. 36 inch walleye....NOT! 53 inch Pike NOT!!!!!! Hey Mepps guess we should have added 6 inches to our pike too! 29 inch largemouth........... do the math on that, they don't even come that long on the Stick Farm or other Trophy southern waters. I am going to submit my 22 inch perch this year!"

I figure you didn't enter because the way they run it and we all here on the board have seen your pics.  It not all about the size (LOL) Cliff mention it best ""it was just a honour to be nominated"""

167666,Terry,2008-03-05 02:42:00,14456,ok then I was just checking......LOL and you are right they are very rare and I doubt most  of the entries well except cliff and fishindevil and Barnie's Band of gold\and other OFNers
167679,nelly,2008-03-05 02:53:00,256,"Bucktail, I think your pic with the smallmouth is one of the holes that I fish. If it's the same one, the average bass there are good size and sometimes they are stack and other time they come and go."

167927,4thgen,2008-03-05 23:11:00,157,"I can't believe nobody has touched on the fact that 90% of the ""cohos"" are dirty old chinooks.  The Fishing Canada contest at least required a measurement picture that some people still took advantage of by holding the tape measure well behind the fish to add on like 6"" (ie. Gary Hodge). The only way to do it properly, in my opinion, is to have a measurement shot with a name brand measuring tape on a level surface. I understand that there aren't really any prizes so they don't care if people lie, but if half of the entries are fake, what's the point in running the awards at all?"
167987,BLACKFISH88,2008-03-06 00:58:00,191,Here's one from quinte last winter not a great pic but it was huge I estimated 14lbs. I was amazed at the size was only kept because it was bleeding profusely from gills. I still think that santa won with his 30lb zander LOL.  
167347,ccmtcanada,2008-03-04 15:31:00,7971,I was looking at the list and I spied Fishndevil on the Salmon list.  Congrats!!  Click the picture to get full sized....still hard to read the names so get out your magnifying glass!!  I'll try and rescan later on tonight....

167367,ccmtcanada,2008-03-04 15:54:00,7971, I ended up tied for 4th for walleye and tied for 4th for carp.  Bly missed out on this years list by a mere half inch for walleye.

Beamish, who is a friend if mine is on the list a few times. His entries are in that range. The Wilmot fish looks suspicious to me. I've never seen a Brookie with bright pink cheeks before. Check out Bountyhunters 25"" fish. Is that not a Steelhead??"

167583,Crazyhook,2008-03-05 00:34:00,1154,I am on the carp list!
