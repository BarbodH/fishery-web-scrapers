We dropped our buckshots tipped with minnows  we were onto fish.  Deadsticking worked as well wit standout hooks . Spent the entire day out there.  It was so beautiful we were sitting there in our sweat shirts. Came back with 60 perch all a good size.         Fished 47 feet of water in the morning and the fishing was slow, we moved out to deeper water later in the day 54feet and we were marking non stop all day.  It was hard to get the fish to bite. A few smelt around and the fish were hitting really light."
