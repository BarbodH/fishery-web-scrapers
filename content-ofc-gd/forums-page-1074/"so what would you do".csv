167686,shane,2008-03-05 03:02:00,652,Nobody's perfect.  It's all about balance.    /    I think I saw this on the Simpsons.
167737,Chris,2008-03-05 12:21:00,405,"No store has ever contacted me after they have overcharged me. I do not contact stores that have undercharged me. Sure, if I were to spend the time to go back to the store, put gas in the car to get there, etc., etc., they might give me my money back....if I could prove that they overcharged me. And I would be glad to give them their money back.....if they call me back and can prove that they undercharged me.  I think the stores karma and my karma have pretty much balanced out over the years."
167776,bramptonjerry,2008-03-05 14:46:00,132,ooooo ChrisS has a compelling argument
167800,Stoty,2008-03-05 15:29:00,2910,"Agreed......  I don't recall the grocery store contacting me over double charging me for a $7 block of cheese!!  But like I said, hopefully I have the same ""bad store karma"" that Jerry had this weekend at BPS. Hopefully they fail to charge me fore the GPS I am going to buy!"
167804,bramptonjerry,2008-03-05 15:31:00,132,Stoty is my new favorite!
167807,Stoty,2008-03-05 15:37:00,2910,   HAHAHHAA   Thanks Jerry!
167810,Kirk,2008-03-05 15:41:00,347,"Joe...no problem...  here's a compromise...call the store and tell them to send someone with a receipt to collect payment for a jacket or whatever gizmo they forgot to ring in while you were standing in line cash in hand, it would be at my home or office at my convenience and they'd send their employee to collect their money and give me a receipt...doubt too many stores would follow up on my offer...depending on the item...wouldn't be worth the employee's time, hourly whatever plus mileage.  I wouldn't return for the same reason.  Going back with cash in hand, A SECOND TIME, basically values your time as 0.00 and the gas and wear and tear on your car, not worth it but they can spend the time and effort.  Even when I return a defective item for a refund or exchange...I spend 10.00 get 10.00 back...my time is wasted in the translation and ends up valued as $0.00, which is poor customer service even in the 'best' stores for exchange and refunds, never mind Lebarons which has a unique journey through the gauntlets of hell before they part possession with a dime by refund."
167544,Daplumma,2008-03-04 23:06:00,1961,"Kirk,I will call you a cynic.I am sure you are not the only one wondering though.I wont beat a dead horse on this.Plain and simple bud,you either believe in doing the right thing for whatever reason or you believe that if someone makes a mistake in your favor its just too bad for them.The driving back to the store and all that without compensation have no bearing on right or wrong.You went thru the hassle of driving there to buy something,right?Be it Karma,Christianity,Budda or The gods of the flaot suit the people that will return and pay have a compelling inner reason to do it and no amount of disbelieving will change that.Did you ever have anyone tell you a really nasty rumor about someone?Did you feel good that they told you cause they could trust you?Or did you wonder why this person thought you were the type that would enjoy such crap?That is the crux of this argument.Which person are you?Not to single you out Kirk,you have been here a long time and I enjoy your posts,just speaking up for the ""other"" side.We are not all the same and that is what makes this world so great. Joe"
167581,bushart,2008-03-05 00:31:00,2628,"On that note...I also belong to that group that was lion bait for the ancient romans.  I also believe the place or amount is immaterial---there is right or wrong in this instance--not much gray area.  I read earlier in this thread about ""In real Life"" well in my real life within the last calendar year I was not charged on my credit card for a rental I used while moving---to the tune of 1800.00 dollars---Well I had it budgeted in the plan --so I called the company and asked them to investigate.  A mistake by a dealer at the other end--they thanked me and knocked 200 of the price---Even if they did not---As I stated in the first thread as a father and Christian how can I do otherwise.  I believe we all need to try in this world to get society to function peacefully.  Bushart"
167589,Burtess,2008-03-05 00:49:00,901,"I am thinking that the ""results of the poll"" would have been MUCH more even had it been anonymous.... I will bet a lot of people did not want to be ""judged"" if they sided with the ""keep it and run"" group....  Notice I did not reply to the original post   .....  Burt"
167602,Daplumma,2008-03-05 01:13:00,1961,"I disagree,I think most are comfortable here giving there names and opinions.For the most part over the years this group of people does do the right thing. Joe"
167609,holdfast,2008-03-05 01:22:00,1813,"So here I was at a gas station after filling up, and after shopping for some snacks I went to the counter and totally forgot that I had filled up.  About 10 minutes later on the Highway, realized that I had accidently stole some gas.  Common sense told me to go back and pay for the gas, but the Gazoo in my head said too sad too bad.  It still bugs me to this day, if you can believe that.  What would of you done in that situation fellas?  Dont worry I wont judge ya"
167630,bushart,2008-03-05 01:53:00,2628,Maybe I'm old fashioned but much of this is trying to rationalize theft.  Does it make it right because you did'nt get caught?
167633,danc,2008-03-05 01:59:00,4677,"How many of you guys that would ""do the right thing"" would go back to the store to pay for a 50 cent item that wasn't charged if the store was a 20 mile drive?"
167648,Daplumma,2008-03-05 02:13:00,1961,"I dont think I would notice .50 but if I did I would mention it to the manager next time I was there.Only to ward off the bad karma of the ill gotten gain.Its not about the amount or looking down your snoot,its knowing that you didn't pay your dues.To each his own... Joe"
