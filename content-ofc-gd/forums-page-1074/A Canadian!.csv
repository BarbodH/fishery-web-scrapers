In case anyone asks you who a Canadian is . . .   Proud to be Canadian  An Australian Definition of a Canadian - Written by an Australian Dentist   You probably missed it in the local news, but there was a report  that someone in Pakistan had advertised in a newspaper an offer of a  reward to anyone who killed a Canadian - any Canadian.   An Australian dentist wrote the following editorial to help define  what a Canadian is, so they would know one when they found one.   A Canadian can be English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German,  Spanish, Polish, Russian or Greek. A Canadian can be Mexican,  African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Australian, Iranian,  Asian, Arab, Pakistani or Afghan.   A Canadian may also be a Cree, MÃ©tis, Mohawk, Blackfoot, Sioux, or  one of the many other tribes known as native Canadians. A  Canadian's  religious beliefs range from Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim,  Hindu or none. In fact, there are more Muslims in Canada than in  Afghanistan. The key difference is that in Canada they are free to  worship as each of them chooses. Whether they have a religion or no  religion, each Canadian ultimately answers only to God, not to the  government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government  and for God.   A Canadian lives in one of the most prosperous lands in the history  of the world. The root of that prosperity can be found in the  Charter of Rights and Freedoms which recognize the right of each  person to the pursuit of happiness.   A Canadian is generous and Canadians have helped out just about  every other nation in the world in their time of need, never asking  a thing in return. Canadians welcome the best of everything, the  best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the  best services and the best minds. But they also welcome the least -  the oppressed, the outcast and the rejected.   These are the people who built Canada. You can try to kill a  Canadian if you must as other blood-thirsty tyrants in the world  have tried but in doing so you could just be killing a relative  or a  neighbour. This is because Canadians are not a particular people  from  a particular place. They are the embodiment of the human spirit of  freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, can be a Canadian.   Please keep this going! Pass this around the World. Then pass it  around again. It says it all, for all of us   'Keep your stick on the ice'"
