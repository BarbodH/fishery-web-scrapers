309158,GBW,2009-02-21 17:36:00,8460,"Hi all.  I need to run out and get a new Coleman Propane Cylinder so I was wondering where to get them at this time of year.  I just need 1 for fishing tomorrow.  I would rather not go to CTC so if there are any other places in the Whitby area I can go please let me know, thanks.  Geoff"
309161,paul_614,2009-02-21 17:46:00,168,"Wallmart, tackle shops......"
309164,GBW,2009-02-21 17:53:00,8460,Walmart would have these now?  humm I guess I'll have a look there.  Tks.
309617,ADB,2009-02-22 19:47:00,444,"For future reference, Le Baron sells them all year round."
309640,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-22 20:50:00,0,  wal mart has them out all year along with crappy tire/home depot/home hardware/zellers
309646,nancur373,2009-02-22 21:11:00,1211,Now what you really need is the fitting to fill those little cylinders from a 20 pounder. You can find them on ebay and hardware stores in the US.
309651,douG,2009-02-22 21:29:00,2693,"That little buggah is tough to find, even though they make them right around the corner, on Atwell Drive at Fairview Fittings.  I finally ended up buying dedicated hoses rather than the adaptors - stove to bottle, and then stove to tank."
309653,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-22 21:34:00,0,  cabelas easiest   20 bucks plus shipping not bad considering the amount of money u will save on the 1 lb tanks they are robbery these days  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...rset=ISO-8859-1
309654,nancur373,2009-02-22 21:39:00,1211,
309656,nancur373,2009-02-22 21:41:00,1211,you need to put the 1 lb tanks in the freezer for 15 minutes first. even then they only fill to about 75%. still cheaper than buying new ones.  Curt

309798,Bernie,2009-02-23 03:43:00,3190,Never totally fill a propane cylinder of any kind. Allow 20% of the space inside for expansion due to temperature increases.
309884,motion,2009-02-23 15:54:00,403,"I agree, great idea. Just bought one from Ebay. I go through a bunch of these and at $5 a piece, I usually try to conserve as much as possible. Now I wont feel so bad using up ones that I fill myself soon.  Cheers"
309910,blue pickeral,2009-02-23 16:45:00,267,Pretty sure that the small blue torch tanks will fit in a pinch - less expensive.
310009,motion,2009-02-23 21:19:00,403,"Crappy Tire stopped selling them. They have the short stubby Coleman type for soldering. They are basically the same price though, no real savings."
310566,Pope29,2009-02-25 02:53:00,29,Curious why you thought Walmart wouldn't have them at this time of year??? There are many year round applications for those little tanks.

310589,GBW,2009-02-25 03:17:00,8460,"because the Walmart by me is garbage, they never have anything in stock.  The CTC is closer but the place it a royal pain to get out of at the time I was going out because of the school."
