309979,tdotfisherman,2009-02-23 20:26:00,317,How about Pike or Musky tournaments? Has anyone ever entered one of these in and around Southern Ontario?
309988,diggyj,2009-02-23 20:41:00,548,"Some of the local resorts on Rice Lake have bass and walleye derbies during the season. Small entry fee, money for top spots and big bass. Followed by some poker tournaments. As they come up I will let you know.  Dirk...."
309990,nancur373,2009-02-23 20:45:00,1211,thanks
309996,Drew_10,2009-02-23 20:50:00,111,Join a local B.A.S.S. chapter.  Clun tournaments are about as cheap as it gets and you don't need to own a boat to fish.
310001,GoneFishin,2009-02-23 20:57:00,349,"How come OFNcommunity.com doesn't hold any fishing tournaments/fund raisers of their own? There's more then enough people interested on this site alone. And I'm sure there are people willing to take the time to set them up.  Just a thought, but it could be fun."
310005,motion,2009-02-23 21:06:00,403,Thats a great idea!
310006,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-23 21:08:00,3761,I also agree!
310008,diggyj,2009-02-23 21:19:00,548,It takes a tonne of work to run one properly. Someone may need to volunteer to set it up. Not sure if the mods would want to do it with everything they have on their plate.  Dirk...
310012,xeon,2009-02-23 21:23:00,350,"Isnt there a giant toury going on right now? lol  Just get some people on the board to donate prizes or something to the biggest fish, winning team ect, if you wanna make it seem more real."
310014,glen,2009-02-23 21:29:00,2641,Yep someone set up the Tournaments and i will take care of the fishing part.
310015,GBW,2009-02-23 21:34:00,8460,"Curt, check out CBAF(.ca) as there may be a club close to you.  I'm a member and I had a great time last year!  You meet new/great people and learn a lot out on the water too!"
310030,misfish,2009-02-23 22:44:00,29133,"I be willing to put one together on a small lake.If theres others that want to help out, let me know.  Only one thing. YOU ALL SIGN A WAVIER."
310051,aniceguy,2009-02-23 23:26:00,1094,"both of these sites can drive you to a local club, you ll have to make a decision on where to go.....  http://www.bigfatbass.com/  http://www.cbaf.ca/  I havnt fished the bass clubs in 2 years but the cbaf is a small membership to join ( like 60 bucks or so ) of which you ll get a sub to flw magazine etc..  Most tournaments are 60 to enter and as a non boater there is a set fee in the 40 to 50 or so range Bottom line where can you spend 100 bucks to go get into a 50 k boat in some cases fish all day with someone who can fishfor bass  hook fish and at the end of the day even make a few bucks"
310052,nancur373,2009-02-23 23:29:00,1211,Just got off the cbaf site. Think I'll join a club there.  Thanks guys.
