On the topic of surviving, there is more to it than hunting and gathering. I have been fortunate  to have been taught many old world skill sets like making bread. How do you make bread if you have no yeast, or if it's too cold for yeast to work? You make unleavened/flat bread. It can be baked in the oven, fried, laid out on a flat rock beside the fire, made thicker and wrapped on a stick over the open fire  Recipes are about as old as the Bible, itself.  Great for soaking up all that rich gravy from the stew    This recipe:  1 cup whole flour 2tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp sugar 2 eggs or sub with 1/4 cup oil 1/2 cup milk or water ( I prefer milk but in the bush water will do) 1 tbsp melted margerine/butter/shortening/lard/etc....  Mix dry ingredients first, then mix in wet ingredients in order. You should have a thick batter. If not add more small amounts of flour til thick. Then cook by your preferred method (oven is 400F for 15 minutes)  Enjoy"
