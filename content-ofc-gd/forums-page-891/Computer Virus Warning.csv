310818,danc,2009-02-25 19:46:00,4677,"From Snopes..  ""Although the Postcard virus is real, it isn't a ""BIG VIRUS COMING"" (it's already been around in multiple forms for a long time now),  it will not ""burn the whole hard disc"" of your computer, CNN didn't classify it as the ""worst virus"" ever, and it doesn't arrive in messages bearing a subject line of ""Invitation""."

310863,GBW,2009-02-25 20:53:00,8460,"I found this on Snopes too it's worth a read!!!!  Male Date Rape Drug  Police warn all male clubbers, party-goers and unsuspecting pub regulars to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink from a woman.  A new date rape drug on the market, called ""beer"", is being used by females to target unsuspecting men. The drug is generally found in liquid form, and is available almost anywhere. ""Beer"" is sometimes used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to convince their male victims to go home and have sex with them.  Typically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of ""beer"" and then simply ask him home for no-strings attached sex. Men are helpless against this approach: After several ""beers"" men often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts with women to whom they would usually not be attracted. Men often awaken after being given ""beer"" with only hazy memories of exactly what happened the night before, just a vague feeling something bad occurred.  Some unfortunate men report having been trapped in a familiar scam known as ""a relationship."" Apparently men are easy victims for this scam after ""beer"" is administered and they've been sexually approached previously.  Please! Forward this warning to every male you know. If you should fall victim to this insidious ""beer"" and the predatory women plying it, there are male Support groups in most towns where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly-affected, like-minded guys."
