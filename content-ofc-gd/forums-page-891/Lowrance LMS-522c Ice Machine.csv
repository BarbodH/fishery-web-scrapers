310409,johnnyb,2009-02-24 22:26:00,3413,"From the quick google search I did...looks like Ebay, Craig's list, Kijiji are your friend...good luck"
310416,leighfns,2009-02-24 22:43:00,103, They have the 522c but not the ice machine
310423,mbac31,2009-02-24 22:58:00,904,I have one of these. What do you need to know about it.
310427,leighfns,2009-02-24 23:05:00,103, Is it for sale  ahaha  Just wondering of they are a good choice and if people know where I can get my hands one
310437,mbac31,2009-02-24 23:22:00,904,Not for sale.   They are great units. Mine are linked on my boats and I take these everywhere that I need a mobile unit. I have the 2 transducers that can be used. I use the ice kit and the proper transducer and I use the normal transducer on my canoe/kayak. I have a 334 unit as well. I would check radio world. I do beleive they were selling some of them for a good price. I paid for my 334 with the full ice kit and boat kit I beleive around $1100 2 years ago.
310467,scugpg,2009-02-25 00:02:00,1373,"I recently got a 522 as well, but without the ice machine. Here's the kit you can buy....for $200 http://www.lei-extras.com/store/search.asp...p;ProdNum=16-46  Honestly, get the 522, spend $40 on a battery & charger, and make a mount for the kit. Less than $50 for it all. Even if you go buy the ice ducer you'll still be way ahead of spending the extra $ on the kit."
310481,leighfns,2009-02-25 00:37:00,103,   hmm...  Perhaps that will be what I will have to do... $200 is pretty steep for a batter/bag and transducer.
310665,superdad,2009-02-25 13:01:00,353,"Cabelas had a sale on the 522c that included the ice kit, check them out for the 'ice kit' probably cheaper than Lowrance.  Cheers"
