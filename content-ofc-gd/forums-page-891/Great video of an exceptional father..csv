310345,Leecher,2009-02-24 19:55:00,7832,Oh man that was one tough video for me to watch.   The love and courage this dad has for his son is incredible. Leechman
310347,web-fisherman,2009-02-24 20:14:00,54,"Roy - Yeah, I had it sent to me and it was on another playback - Google I think.  Love it!"
310348,web-fisherman,2009-02-24 20:17:00,54," Leechman - I hope your doing ok under your situation. I lost my father-in-law a few years so our family went through those hard times as well. This is a good time to surround yourself around friends and family to share those good times.  Were all thinking of ya man!!!  Best,  Mike"
310349,Leecher,2009-02-24 20:22:00,7832," I'm doing ok Mike, don't worry.... just got a little intense watching it and brought a memory flash. Jacques"
310355,Rattletrap2,2009-02-24 20:38:00,1652,"Thanks Mike! I've also seen that video and read the story quite a few times. Don't make the ""choking up"" any less just the same. A great story, but tough to watch without feeling something."
310378,web-fisherman,2009-02-24 21:11:00,54, I with you on that.
