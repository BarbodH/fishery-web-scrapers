310556,fishhunter,2009-02-25 02:23:00,604,I do think that is the speck master holding that fish. Hats off to the speck king!!!! All Hale King Terry
310557,Terry,2009-02-25 02:25:00,14456,I WILL GUESS  
310563,Leecher,2009-02-25 02:45:00,7832,Nice looking speck Terry  Are you sure that the back lake you caught that speck isn't connected to Temagami?? Cause if it is then your skunk is off my friend
310564,irishfield,2009-02-25 02:48:00,26272,We're not letting him off that easy Jacques ! lol
310573,Leecher,2009-02-25 02:59:00,7832,"  OK Wayne, but I tried LOL"
310587,walleyemaster,2009-02-25 03:14:00,325,sounds like you guys had a great time...and thats what its all about..
310588,Dano,2009-02-25 03:16:00,719,"Yea, it was a great time despite the weather, though we did have one absolutely gorgeous day where everyone fell victim to sunburn. We hit the lake hard, gritted our teeth and headed into the eye of the storm....several times. There were periods while I was driving the sled, following Wayne on the lake not more that 40 ft. back when he would completey disappear for quite a while.....digging sleds out, negotiating tight swithback trails while towing huts, freezing hands and best of all, great company. I'd do it all over again in a second.  Enough of that, the trip into the speck lake was an adventure in itself.....both days. This was a great crew to spend the time with, thanks for letting it happen Wayne! I didnt take as many pics as usual, but here is what I got.  Here is Capn' Lloyd, call him chefy, he supplied and cooked the food, thanks Lloyd!   Keith, Terry, Joe and Wayne....Wayne, what are you doing?   A night shot of the Chilcoot trail, looking down at the lake from the deck.   Waynes beauty speck!   Another shot of it   A nice brace of brookies   Wonderful memories. Joe was a nice addition to the crew this year and we all had a lot of laughs ( oh its well past that time Joe!). You know, one of the added bonuses of spending time with this gang is that I always come away a better fisherman because of it. It was nice to fish with you again too Keith. Terry, lol, I heard your rant across the breadth of Kokoko Lake, I said to Lloyd, uh oh, I think Terry just lost a fish...lol! Capn' Lloyd (buttercup) its always a pleasure buddy and Wayne, thanks for being such a gracious host. Sorry I missed meeting you Bunk, maybe next time.  Cheers"
310635,Moosebunk,2009-02-25 07:47:00,3970,"Holy great speck Wayne.  Not in trouble am I?  btw, cozy place and easy to find."
310742,irishfield,2009-02-25 16:17:00,26272, We'll let you off with a warning this time bud!
310819,Terry,2009-02-25 19:47:00,14456,"Rant you call that a rant, I just strung together a few curse words together you should hear when I go into a rant......LOL   it was good to meet you Moosebunk  , what happened to the other 82 photos....LOL"
310835,irishfield,2009-02-25 20:05:00,26272,Sorry Terry... that workshop thingy got in the way! I'll get to work on them ! lol
310837,Terry,2009-02-25 20:09:00,14456,yup work can get in the way
310840,Bernie,2009-02-25 20:14:00,3190,"I really like the ""do the dishes/skunked thing"". What do you think Joe? Should I get some pink latex gloves?"
310841,irishfield,2009-02-25 20:17:00,26272,No need Bernie... he carries his own pair! lmao !
310844,Terry,2009-02-25 20:20:00,14456,"Bernie, he really did bring his own.  a man must know his limitations"
310847,Headhunter,2009-02-25 20:27:00,5703,"In fact, the gloves were originally brought up to deal with the ""reach around"" I was told to be aware of... the watermelon spray was simply a very nice touch! The full poly pink suit was delayed at the border!!!! Bernie, same rule holds true, whether your on Temagami or Nip! Except the cook doesn't clean! HH"
310848,irishfield,2009-02-25 20:28:00,26272,Gee Joe.. I wasn't gonna post the picture of the new guys gift ! lol
310448,Terry,2009-02-24 23:38:00,14456,"Well   2 years and I have not caught a fish on temagami    We had a blast, lots of fun, jokes  and food  we ran to some backs lakes for specks and walleye      the trip up there was nasty, Headhunter showed up and we headed out just got on the 400 and there was lots of black ice and I was sliding all over the place, it snowed and the wind blew but we talked all the way there and time went fast  got there around noon we unpacked and took off to find the guys fishing   did I say I have yet to hook a fish on temagami   oh and my camera foze up and the lens had moisture in it so the pictures I took were blurry  I am sure others will post   pictures and fish that :THEY: caught......  thanks Wayne, I had another great trip up there"
310451,Terry,2009-02-24 23:40:00,14456,"by the way  don't believe the stories that I was a little P.O.ed when a fish got off my line, would never happen....LOL"
310453,misfish,2009-02-24 23:44:00,29133,"I have been with you and have heard the same stories.You got the SKUNK A ROO didnt you??????? Come on, tell the truth.  I think I,ll wait to hear the other stories, to make my final decision on your post."
310456,BUSTER,2009-02-24 23:47:00,1336,whats that smell?
310457,Terry,2009-02-24 23:49:00,14456,well   that smell is 5 days without running water  LOL  but I think I did say  2 years and I have not caught a fish on temagami and Last year was the first time on the lake  you do the math
310460,misfish,2009-02-24 23:52:00,29133," Math was my best subject.,,,,,,,,,,,99 BOTTLES OF,,,,,,,,,,,,   A polar bear dip would of been a nice thought."

310478,glen,2009-02-25 00:30:00,2641,Thats ok Terry.  I will find that post with all the pictures of the walleye you have caught.
310482,irishfield,2009-02-25 00:40:00,26272,"Come on Terry... don't be so damn hard on yourself! LMAO !!  Oh.. and you did forget to mention that while you... and I.. and someone else did get skunked on Temagami, we didn't get skunked somewhere else where you pulled 7 fish up the hole ! And 7 purdy fish they wuz ...  ....and as for that ""missed"" fish... man I wish I had that on video to share with EVERYONE!"
310488,medmart,2009-02-25 00:45:00,587,Terry as long as you had a good time with friends thats all that counts  Rob

310504,irishfield,2009-02-25 01:04:00,26272,"I think I'm the only one that took any pictures... and posting ain't gonna happen tonight. Been a long 7 days.. they went by way to darn fast.. but us 40..oh and Terry.. 50 something fellas roaming around on sleds for 60+ mile round trips two days in a row (in pretty rough wind blown drift conditons), plus all the other trips, slush shovelling, lifting sleds, slamming into trees, etc took the toll on me at least."
310505,BUSTER,2009-02-25 01:08:00,1336,slamming into tree's eh!  cant wait for the pics now...
310513,Terry,2009-02-25 01:19:00,14456,"yeah it does wear you out  wears you out not me   oh wait, me too, I sure slept well last night  it was an adventure for sure  backing my ski-doo down that tight trail because the sled before me couldn't make it up the hill was interesting too  the second day when we tried again to get to that speck lake and Wayne's sled was buried in slush right up to the auger and we dug it out and still all got on the lake and fished, was pretty crazy.....   and yes I did get fish on that lake  it is possible I caught the most fish that day.............."
310517,misfish,2009-02-25 01:27:00,29133," Im sure the mrs,s did to bud.  No pics need of that that."
310518,douG,2009-02-25 01:29:00,2693,"Attaboy, Terry, glad you guys all made it home safely."

310535,Terry,2009-02-25 02:00:00,14456,Wayne has 40 pictures and he posted those   LOL oh well it was our punishment for not catching fish
310539,fishhunter,2009-02-25 02:05:00,604,Well it was a blast like always. fishing was good and friendship even better!!!! Terry it will come lol Next year Terry you need to enjoy a few lemon drops it helps put fish on the ice for one of us lol
310540,Headhunter,2009-02-25 02:06:00,5703,"Well, I had a blast! I gotta thank Wayne and Terry, Wayne for the invite and hospitality for starters and Terry for carting my fat buttocks up hwy 11 and all over h.e.l.l.'s half acre of Temagami! You know, it's not often that you put your trust in someone you really don't know that well and I found it kinda funny, that I was able to do so with Terry. I'll explain. I don't have a snowmobile helmut, so Wanye lent me his old one. Well, one Satruday morning, when we headed out for the brookie lake, at minus 28, we managed to travel about 50 yards before my visor froze solid! I was completely blind for 25 miles! That my friends, is trust! An entire morning in the truck talking and you get to know a guy pretty good! I learned tons from these guys about fishin. Not a laker or whitie guy in my past, boy did I get schooled! Keith was fun to watch! Lloyd, same thing and pretty funny to! Dano, well what can yah say but... Dano, quick, look what time it is!!! Wayne, thanks for everything! Too many to mention. Now, the pics with the gloves... I'd heard that if you don't catch, you wash dishes, so I thought Terry might need them... turned out Terry and I did alot of dishes! LMAO! (Wayne got off on a technicality!) I am preparing myself for the pending pics! Gonna have speckles for supper on Firday!!!!! HH"
310541,fishhunter,2009-02-25 02:06:00,604,Your just lucky the store was closed for the outfit we had picked out for you and you sleeping partner that we could not get lol
