309688,nautifish,2009-02-22 23:34:00,1416,"Feb. 22 / 2009 Hi all, Just returned from the 1st annual Jimmy Riggin's (Rotten Ronnies Bait) Long Point Bay perch ice fishing tournament. Theres something special about a first annual event like this because it turns into a tradition, and this one will. In twenty years, people who are still going will say ""I was at the first one ever"". Its so nice to see the kids and families enjoying outdoor events like this one together. The weather and roads were pretty nasty this morning so I thought the turnout was great. We started the day meeting Dave (Northerner) and his wife Darlene, Steve (Nightwatcher)  From ammo's aka (Nautifish) fishing site at Rotten Ronnies Bait in Long Point. Jimmy Riggins the owner and reason the tournie happened was there with his wife to greet the competitors. Always a warm reception from both of them, truly nice people. After a wrong turn dead end (every road in Long Point is a dead end, including the main road in) we found  Old Cut and met our ride out. A very special thanks to Rob Saunders and his son Matt for giving us a lift onto the ice and for supplying the hut & heat....we can't thank you enough.  The ride out to the hut was comparable to a cross country trek in the arctic. Rob set us up in our temporary home on the ice and left us to fish. Steve set up his luxury accomadations ..the ""CLAM"" and we were off and fishing.     I kept checking to make sure Steve ( Nightwatcher) was still alive in his little tent as he disappeared inside and wasnt seen again. We're pretty sure he had a T.V. , microwave and bar fridge in there but he wouldnt let us in to see. lol Darlene , Ammo (Nauti) and I set up shop in the hut ...Dave earned his name Northerner and fished outside claiming that it was a summer day compared to where he comes from. Ammo ( Nauti) soon learned that her head was higher (and softer) than the roof of the icehut when she banged her noggin on it ...... twice. As if she isnt dizzy enough. Darlene supplied the caffiene in the form of chocolate covered coffee beans.  We looked for a Hortons but the Long Point Bay market hasnt been tapped by them  ...... yet. Dave caught the first fish.   He won our private tournament by catching the most fish of the day, I think he caught five or six,   Steve got two,This was his 1st fish of the day.   I got two and Darlene got one. Darlene fish.   Sinns fish   Sinns second fish and darlene eating her chocolate covered coffee  beans..lol    Have you noticed who's name isnt mentioned in the fish catching dept. ?    Even the perch queen can have an off day and Im sure Dave is going to remind her of it. Time flew on the ice, which it does when you are in good company and soon our ride was back to pick us up. My face is still thawing from the ride back in. I had a helmet without a visor and I looked like I had come back from an arctic expedition when we got back to old cut. My eyes kept freezing shut.  Back at Rotten Ronnies the hot chocolate was flowing and the hotdogs were steaming.  The weigh in produced the winner. Like most competitions experience and age dictated the winner. He stood tall and proud .....well not too tall. He was two or three years old and had a whopper of a perch.  All in all, an excellent day. A decent turnout and alot of fun. If you didnt make it out to this one, plan on attending the 2nd annual. Thanks to Dave,Darlene,Steve (the man who lived in a clam) for making it so enjoyable. Once again, a huge thank you to Jimmy, his wife, Rob and Matt for making our day a memorable one. See you all at the 2nd next year !!! Sinns & Nauti. A couple more photo's.   "
309698,Mike the Pike,2009-02-23 00:01:00,3421,Great report Tracy good to see a report from you since you live a busy life.  That is one nice looking perch did you happen to hear how big it really was.  Some of those shots look like you guys were on the North pole  
309700,nautifish,2009-02-23 00:05:00,1416,Thanx Mike.....  No i never happened to hear how much that perch weighed to be honest i was so busy talking to people....lol.....Then the next thing i notice is a few people taking pictures so i quickly ran over to get a few shots of my own.  He was so cute......It was fabulous seeing the kids out with dad fishing today. That little guy was more interested in his new fishing pole than the perch....lol...
309812,xeon,2009-02-23 05:13:00,350,"Just curious, how busy is it during the winter at long point? I remember being there for opening day bass last year and there were well over 200 boats in the first part of the bay where the yearly fishing sanctuary is. I still remember casting from a 14' aluminum and having people in 25'+ boats just trolling by literly 10ft away acting as if they didnt see you. Dont get me started on trying to find the Old Cut livery, let alone the street its on."
309858,nautifish,2009-02-23 14:13:00,1416,  Long point or should i say the inner bay is very busy during the winter months when the bay is frozen and the oporaters are up and running.  I fish the bay alot never had a problem but then i know not too hit the bay on Bass opener day....Just like bass opener on any other body of water it is crazy and i do not enjoy shoulder to shoulder fishing in a boat.  As for the Sanctuary click on the link. http://www.longpoint.on.ca/sanct.htm
