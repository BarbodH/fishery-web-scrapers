310661,Photoz,2009-02-25 12:56:00,792,This is somewhat more accurate! Anybody for drivin' your car on THIS?   
310662,Greencoachdog,2009-02-25 12:57:00,8163," I've never been to Port Hope, but I did notice what looks like a freakin' Palm tree on the left side of the pic... I don't think too many Palm trees grow outdoors in Canada!"
310663,Greencoachdog,2009-02-25 12:58:00,8163, Go for it Steve!!!... your insurance will cover you!!!
310666,johnnyb,2009-02-25 13:04:00,3413,"Well, yeah, there are palm trees in Canada...not just glow in the dark ones on hwy. 11 either (although those are my favourite  )...I had dinner here a couple summers ago...in Port Dover  "
310672,Photoz,2009-02-25 13:17:00,792," T'anks a lot buddy!!   I'm actually surprised there was nobody sittin/ out on that ice . . .    there was 3""+ out there . . .    I've often seen 'em sitting just about in the middle of that shot, on that much ice. I wonder if ice fishing regs cover this . . .   2 rods, or because it's a river . .    one rod?"

310681,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-25 13:38:00,2585,"yep i noticed right away that is not port hope, there is a palm tree in the background"
310682,Mike Pike,2009-02-25 13:38:00,1332,"The picture is not Port Hope and doesn't even look like its in Canada.  But hey, who cares about checking facts.  Much easier to just blame Immigrants for stuff."
310692,Zebco,2009-02-25 14:15:00,123,"If the Immigrants weren't the cause we couldn't point the finger could we.  Look at the Major cities in Canada, they all are filled with immigrants. Now look at the crime rates, wow the most crime is where these people live.  We can't blame them though because we will be called racist, but you guys can scream discrimination as much as you want to your advantage.  Next time I get pulled over or asked for a my liscense, I'm gonna try the ""Me speaky no english"" and start singing like the dali lama."
310697,Mike Pike,2009-02-25 14:31:00,1332,And let us know how that goes.
310698,Raf,2009-02-25 14:34:00,3495,i think there's peopel here who havent been out in 20 yrs much less to Port Hope
310700,kingofthesteelhead,2009-02-25 14:39:00,140,I have fished Port Hope for over 30 years.It still continues to be one of the best spots in Southern ontario. You have to pick your days and just get in there with the rest of the crowd. It really isn't that bad. I come from Oshawa and wouldn't waste my time at Thomas street as there are 3-5 people at each hole when the fish are in. At least at Port Hope you have lots of area to fish. I am glad a lot of steelheaders don't go there all the more fish for me!
310707,capt bruce,2009-02-25 14:57:00,820,"Sorry BUt I did know it was not port hope in the picture some people can recognize scarcasim when they see it lol . I thought we were talking about the zoo at port hope ,not the picture that I thought was a great CARTOON Representation of the mess I see at port hope most weekends . I live in TO still , but i have bought a new house in Brockville and comute there every Fri and return Sun so i pass by port hope 7-8 times a month on my way there and back. I have tried a few times ,late and early , to wet a line there as I have lots of old memories of fishing there with my dad , and its just way way to crowded . I also think as someone else said  its because its one of the few spots where there is easy access , for all , the experenced steal guys can walk the streams, find pools by them selves etc. ect. but where does the weekend guy , the wheel chair guy ,the newbe even the guy with bad back go ????? we need more access to our wters for these people so the crowds can thin out"
310712,FLEX ROD,2009-02-25 15:07:00,394,"Zebco – read ,my post my point is not to single out a whole continent and unless you are a true native your roots are of immigrant nature also, and if we investigate what came here and where it came from we will find that most of it was 1. From Europe and 2. Again “ most” of it was the undesirables and prisoners thieves and un desirables that basically had the choice of prison death or the New World.  I am not on a pro immigrant rant here I am on an anti racist and ani bigotry rant; treat each case on its own merit. Both my son and I are active members of Trout Unlimited to the point that I am on the executive committee and we both go out and do what we can to support TU and the whole environment from planting trees in the rain to streamside rehab and yes to picking up garbage also.  RAF – if that shot was directed at me, no problem I will handle any and all comments so in this case you are sadly mistaken I do get out as much as I can but unfortunately a Canadian almost killed me in a car accident so heath and kids have taken a big bite out of my free time but I still put on a lot of miles and Kilometres on my truck and I do get out to the Ganny, she is in the top 5 rivers that I have the pleasure to fish.  Any other shots can be addressed to me as I will be happy to stand my ground or PM me.  FLEX - John"
310714,davew3,2009-02-25 15:20:00,430,Somebody must be bored.   Look at the palm trees in the background.   Yes Port Hope gets crowded but there are all types of ignorant fishermen.  Do not blame just one.  Regards
310716,Toronto_Angler,2009-02-25 15:24:00,698,  I agree...Gotta love some of the stereotyping that goes on here by some of the members.
310743,Stoty,2009-02-25 16:18:00,2910,"Lighten up people...it was meant to be a joke.  No matter if your white, brown, blue, purple or pink...Port Hope is a zoo, and its really annoying!  I went down there yesterday to check the river out, and it was frozen over. But that didnt stop 3 guys from using the winch on his Hummer, to try and break up the ice!"
310746,FLEX ROD,2009-02-25 16:34:00,394,"  No Stoty this was not meant as a joke - and no response has been issued to state that, so that does justify these responses.  Nobody is arguing that the Ganny is a ZOO, but insulting a whole Continent of "" mostly "" honest hard working people should not be tolerated and or allowed!  If the post stated what you just did ""No matter if your white, brown, blue, purple or pink...Port Hope is a zoo, and its really annoying!"", that would have been fully understandable and agreable too, and recieved a completly different response,   and their would have been no need to lighten up  FLEX - John"
310782,quickme,2009-02-25 18:44:00,261," Flex, I agree that the post was Insulting.  I am of asian decent and have been through enough experiences of racial conflicts in my 31 years of fishing.  I'd love to say its much better now but as we can see by the post it really hasn't changed.  I've learned to ignore it and just let it pass.  One day I'll go out with Stoty in his new Ranger to some small town and he'll see the reaction I get.   The Ganny is a Zoo because of all the ""PEOPLE"" that fish there...  Not the number of pink, brown, yellow, black, purple people that are there!   Nick"
310357,Paully,2009-02-24 20:41:00,712,Where's a C.O when you need one... 
310362,capt bruce,2009-02-24 20:49:00,820,"Giveing my age away but I remember when you could fish in port hope and have the place to yourself most days , what a zoo is right ..."
310364,chickenhawk,2009-02-24 20:50:00,612,lol....looks about right!   Hawk
310368,misfish,2009-02-24 20:56:00,29133, Power of the WWW. Bruce.  I can remember going there 30 yrs ago and there would be 20 or so guys tops.
310375,bigugli,2009-02-24 21:04:00,6138,Even in the late 80's it could be a zoo with people shoulder to shoulder. Nothing has changed; almost.   Fewer CO's these days
310376,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-24 21:09:00,10439,"That sign is only for Canadians. I think you will find most of those people are of Eastern European origin. It does not apply to them. Even back in the 90's when I told one of them that Lake Trout were out of season he just ignored me and put it in his car. The OPP officer who arrived after my phone call took the fish but did not charge him. It seems that recent immigrants to our country have no respect for our natural resources or the laws that protect them. I'm by no means being racist but if I were to go to another country I would abide by their laws and we should expect immigrants to our country to obey ours. I'm sure some of those people in the photo are Canadians too but thier numbers are small in number when compared to the rest. I remeber one day watching the CO marching a crowd of poachers from what was then the sanctuary south of Dundas back upstream. There was close to a dozen caught and I will tell you this, that not one of them was born in this country. As I said I don't care where you are from there are laws in place for a reason and using your ethnicity as an excuse not to abide by them is wrong.  Rant Over.   P.S. To the Admin Staff, if you think that this post is out of line please remove it. I am not trying to slight anyone I'm just trying to convey my feelings about poachers and what is becoming of our country."
310379,misfish,2009-02-24 21:21:00,29133," Might get yanked Drift, but I can concure with your statment."
310382,osmondrs,2009-02-24 21:40:00,61,"Hey, Drifter.  I don't blame you for your sentiment.  Mind you, I'm saying this as a recent immigrant.  Conservation laws don't mean much in many parts of the world and I have quite a bit of experience with trying to get someone to enforce laws in places where poaching is considered a birth-right.  Effective enforcement takes place when everyone who cares acts as a C.O. when required, and takes a stand.  In my view, I don't give two hoots what the person's background is when it comes to someone trying to destroy what belongs to all of us and our generations to come.  You did the right thing by calling the cops on the guy you saw breaking the law.  Your efforts are in no way wasted.  That dude will probably think twice before doing something like that again, knowing that there are those who care."
310391,purekgw,2009-02-24 22:00:00,585,people keep more then they should or even out of season fish all the time in the grand makes me SO mad like what gives them the right to abuse the fishery
310395,solopaddler,2009-02-24 22:07:00,8605,Did you guys even look at the picture? Ummm...that ain't Port Hope!
310398,lew,2009-02-24 22:12:00,12766, Not unless they built a bunch of water front hi-rises in the last 6 months
310401,fishhunter,2009-02-24 22:14:00,604,Port Hope may be a zoo!! It has been for the 25 years that I have fished here and a few before my time im sure. Funny that people dont like the zoo but they keep coming back lol. As for the C.O. well thats a hole nother matter. Just do what you can. take a pic of the person and what he or she is doing wrong. take a pic of the car then just call local Port Hope police. They are more then happy to help weed out bad zoo animals. Have lived here 10 years and have used then lots of times to help fix a problem on the river. No need to get upset or yell just call and enjoy a good day of zoo fishing.
310402,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-24 22:15:00,10439," Yeah I looked at it, but it could have changed since I was last there 5 years ago. Don't blame me for not knowing it had changed there Paddler Boy!!!!"
310404,misfish,2009-02-24 22:17:00,29133, Nope I didnt.Just read the report
310405,kemper,2009-02-24 22:18:00,2232,kinda off topic...but does anyone know the numbers that head up the ganny? Is it really enough above other rivers to warrant the mass fishing fest 24 hours a day?
310406,buckster,2009-02-24 22:21:00,530,I think its the park and fish convinence personally!
310408,johnnyb,2009-02-24 22:25:00,3413,"I was waiting for someone to point out that it's not Port Hope!  I've just never been there, but from looking at the pic, figured it didn't look quite right   I liked the posts that were coming up though...gotta stand up for resources, like Osmond and Drifter said. Kemp...don't you have accounting to do?"
310410,highdrifter,2009-02-24 22:34:00,2534," Yeah no shnikes..  That looks like Long Beach, CA!!!"
310414,kemper,2009-02-24 22:42:00,2232, yes....still
310415,bigugli,2009-02-24 22:43:00,6138, Haven't been back there in over 20 years. Have no idea what it looks like any more.
310428,Billy Bob,2009-02-24 23:07:00,5865,I can see cactus type trees in the picture. You guys have them in the Great White North now ? ? ?
310459,bigugli,2009-02-24 23:51:00,6138, Yup.   ANd a whole forest of glow in the dark palm trees up Hwy 11 at gasoline alley!
310462,misfish,2009-02-24 23:56:00,29133, When I seen this reply I had to take me time and swallow(wasted enough from Roys replies).How true that is Bruce.
310625,douG,2009-02-25 05:32:00,2693,"Yo, PaddlerBoy.  I just like saying that, I don't mean nothing by that.  PaddlerBoy tee hee.  I call him Mike."
310641,solopaddler,2009-02-25 10:49:00,8605, Doug don't you sleep? LOL! At least I've got a reason for being up.
