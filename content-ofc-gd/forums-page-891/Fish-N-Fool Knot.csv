310562,irishfield,2009-02-25 02:43:00,26272,  Trilene knot was all I ever used..until I started loosing lures for no reason on braid when snagged. All I could determine was the knot was slipping undone and I started using the palmar on ppro on Lew's suggestion.
310570,Leecher,2009-02-25 02:57:00,7832," Thanks Bill... wasn't sure and now come to think of it, the trilene knot goes throught the hook eye twice, twist 5-6 times and tag end back into the loop.   I use the uni now on braid and when I get a snag, the hook will straighten before the line breaks.  That knot, the more you pull on it the more it tightens."
310575,Sinker,2009-02-25 03:00:00,8692,"  I may have lied  I use the improved clinch knot for everything......even braid. I just melt the tag end off, and it wont slip through with the little bit of burnt line on the end. I haven't seen it slip at all though.  S."
310579,jwl,2009-02-25 03:03:00,1056," beats me , always just called it the ""fishing knot"" it's more on the lines of what Kemper was talking about in his reply...wrap it around, put it through the hole, spit on it and tighten  , it's worked since I was a little kid and still works today so can't be that bad"
310593,kemper,2009-02-25 03:31:00,2232,"  ah but it does!  I added a little twist of my own with braid. Insead of pulling it tight after i go thru the loop, I take the tag through the new loop that was created by going thru the first one.  Holds like a charm even with braid"
310600,snag,2009-02-25 03:48:00,1932,Uni
310601,Sinker,2009-02-25 03:51:00,8692,"  That is an  improved clinch knot. The improvement is putting it thru the second loop.  A clinch knot is just wrapping it around 5 times, and thru the hole. Some might call it a fishing knot too  Works for everything, and takes about 3 seconds to tie with frozen hands.  Sinker"
310615,Garry2Rs,2009-02-25 04:49:00,1425,"On the Knot Wars show they use a machine to apply increasing tension until the knot or the line breaks. With the top knots the line often fails first...also the top knots are reaching tension well above the rated strength of the line. IE 20 pounds on 15 pound line. But in the end, these tests are entertainment, not the real world...for one thing, the lines are tested dry. I thought the twice through the eye thing was interesting, and will be adding it to every knot I tie."
310617,EC1,2009-02-25 04:57:00,930,"I watched this too, and supposedly this knot is the best for all lines - Braid, Fluoro, and Mono!  Garry is probably right about it being tested dry instead of wet though.  Tried out this knot the other day, but then I didn't catch fish, so I can't tell you whether the knot was any good. It was really hard to tie this knot at first though. This knot needs quite a bit of practice"
310637,Fish-N-Fool,2009-02-25 08:10:00,3,"Hi All, Fish-N-Fool here! The guy that developed the Fish-N-Fool Knot. Hope to answer a few questions for you and help you learn to tie the Fish-N-Fool knot.  Garry2r's   FNF;  You are very correct any knot that has 2 passes thought the hook eye is stronger then 1. I have tested all kinds of knots and the same knot with an extra wrap aroung the hook eye is always stronger. 3 wraps are stronger then 2 in some cases also.  Garry2r's  FNF; The Double Uni knot is used to tie 2 lines of the same diamater together, not to tie a line to a hook. I real Uni knot is once through the hook eye and 4 times around the main line. The Fish-N-Fool knot is twice around the hook eye and 5 to 7 wraps on the main line. This adds about 150% to the knots strength. A Uni knot tied with 14LB. trilene mono broke at 14.3 LB.  very respectable but with the same line the Fish-N-Fool Knot held untill the line broke at 20.53LB.  Garry2r's  FNF;  No it's not just turn ur head lol  Garry2r's  FNF; I also tie this same knot but in a little differant way I call it the Double Straw Knot as I use a straw to tie it with, I dont know of the tool you are using as an aid to tie this but a straw works. It's not as EZ to tie as the Fish-N-Fool knot. But I think it might be stronger also. I'm a knot tying fool also lol  I have about 4 totally differant knots I have developed that have tested very strong. This is one of them.      Here is My Fish-N-Fool knot with a better Diagram that will help you tie it easier. Note how you hold the knot with your middle fingers. The loop is facing you when you it, so if you turn the diagram on it's side is how you look at the knot when tying it. Also if I'm tying a Worm type hook on I hold the hook with the little finger it keeps it held and out of the way very nicely.     If you have any questions just shoot ."
310638,Fish-N-Fool,2009-02-25 08:21:00,3,"EC1  FNF; The stats are, it tested the best of all knots with Mono and braid and second best by a very small margine with Fluorocarbon, Still very impressive! I didnt know how good my knot really was till I saw it on TV."
310639,Fish-N-Fool,2009-02-25 08:27:00,3,Garry2r's  FNF; I've been testing The Fish-N-Fool knot in the Real World for a number of years and it passes with flying colors
310695,Raf,2009-02-25 14:28:00,3495,"you're kidding right?  you are naming the uni after yourself and claim to have 'come up' with it? have a look at the insert in a box of powerpro and see what they call this exact knot - WITH twice through the eye and 7 or 8 wraps.    if you're serious, you've really earned your name."
310702,Zebco,2009-02-25 14:42:00,123,So I can steal your knot and make it 3 times through the eye and 10 times around the main and name it the Spider Monkey?
310834,Headhunter,2009-02-25 20:04:00,5703,"Raf, you owe me a new keyboard!!!! Oh, the pain, the pain!!! HH"
310838,diggyj,2009-02-25 20:13:00,548,Wasn't expecting this to become such a heated debate.
310843,irishfield,2009-02-25 20:19:00,26272,Winternet... and Raf is an IT guy......
310854,Raf,2009-02-25 20:31:00,3495,did i mention it's a uni knot?
310857,solopaddler,2009-02-25 20:41:00,8605,"   Relax buddy you seem tense, knotted up in fact."
310870,capt bruce,2009-02-25 21:10:00,820,"A knot by any other name still holds as strong or it a rose and smell or ....  Raf did i hear you say it was a uni ..lol I have been useing this knot (silly me I just called it a knot ) for 30 years untill braid and than because of what I think is slipping I swiched to the other knot (I think its called palomar sp now I just called it the other knot , ).. Raf is a well respected member here mister fool so please behave or Roy will make you go sit in the corner"
310889,solopaddler,2009-02-25 21:46:00,8605,He really got his panties in a knot didn't he?
310907,Spiel,2009-02-25 22:39:00,9065,"Uno, I'm knot interested in seeing how this unfolds...."
310283,diggyj,2009-02-24 17:03:00,548,Someone brought this to my attention. It's from the Knot Wars that has been going on. As it turns out this knot is supposed to be the best and strongest. Has anyone ever used it?  Why don't the pros use this knot?  Dirk 
310285,douG,2009-02-24 17:06:00,2693,"They do use it, but they call it a uni knot. Uni Knot"
310286,rbaquial,2009-02-24 17:10:00,968," DouG, he only passed it through the ""Eye"" once... instead of twice, which I guess is a 'slight' variation of the knot?... I remember once trying to tie it... I was having a bit of a hard time with it... mind you, this was LONG before I was learning knots.... I'll probably give it another shot this up-coming season"
310288,diggyj,2009-02-24 17:13:00,548,"The Uni only goes through the eye once.  Do you think this will work for mono, fluoro and braid?  Dirk...."
310289,rbaquial,2009-02-24 17:15:00,968,"I can't remember what type of line I was using at the time (more than likely it was mono; I used to be religious about it! haha)... and from what I can recall, when it came down to 'sinching' down the knot... it was giving me difficulties....may have tied it wrong probably... but i dunno..."
310290,douG,2009-02-24 17:15:00,2693,"Even if you pass your line through the eye three times, it still looks like a Uni Knot."
310292,rbaquial,2009-02-24 17:18:00,968," True, but its 'modified'... but ever so slightly. which COULD make a difference... ya know?"
310295,BillM,2009-02-24 17:22:00,17367,"I haven't lost a steelie due to a failed knot yet, I'll stick with my improved clinch  It's also very easy to tie with frozen fingers.."
310297,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-24 17:31:00,2050,"That used to be my ""go to"" knot.  Passed through twice as seen in the picture, ever since I was a wee angler.  I always just called it a Double Uni.... I only ever used it on Mono because I hadn't used braid until about 2 years ago.  I was showed the Palomar a couple years ago, and have since switched.  The Palomar is faster and easier to execute, and is just as reliable.   I've actually probably had more break-offs with my ""Double Uni"" than with that Palomar....but that could just be because I used it longer...  Cheers, UF"
310328,BillM,2009-02-24 18:46:00,17367,"I use the palomar with braid, but never with mono...  I can't tell you why really, lol"
310333,jwl,2009-02-24 19:03:00,1056,"I use the same knot since I was a kid..just call it the ""fishing knot"" ever since I can remember...it's simple and never lets me down"
310350,eye-tracker,2009-02-24 20:27:00,89,"I use the Uni and double Uni knot for everything, that way I only have to know one knot  . It is great all around knot for everything from a hook to adding leaders to super-lines.   -sheldon"
310352,Radnine,2009-02-24 20:31:00,1538,I've got better drawings stuck on my fridge with magnets.
310353,Raf,2009-02-24 20:33:00,3495," same here, whenever a clinch type knot is needed.  this one works great for braid or mono.  when a loop knot is needed (ie. to form a loop on a leader), google perfection loop"
310356,Leecher,2009-02-24 20:40:00,7832," I use the uni knot also and find it very strong with all types of line.  With mono & fluoro, the only thing I would suggest is to make sure the line is wet when tightening and sliding the knot.  I used to tie on the Trilene knot and though it was the stongest but my good friend Paul persuade me to switch over...  and I don't regret it one bit"
310360,SlowPoke,2009-02-24 20:47:00,2984,"I use the nail knot for everything except splicing leadcore (willis). The nail knot covers braid/mono/fluoro, different diameters, snells... I can't think of anything it wouldn't work for although I'm sure there is something. I'm going to try it on leadcore as well."
310384,rbaquial,2009-02-24 21:42:00,968, LOL....does it have an actual name??
310393,kemper,2009-02-24 22:03:00,2232,"Am I the only person that uses only one knot?  I dont even know what its called...  Through the eye, spin the bugger around 6 or 7 times, back through the loop  spit on it yank tight and BAM there ya go"
310397,Leecher,2009-02-24 22:12:00,7832, I think it's called the trilene knot.... but could be mistaken
310432,Garry2Rs,2009-02-24 23:14:00,1425,"I have also been watching Knot Wars. Last year they had a knot called the Eye Crosser.  It was basically a Uni knot that went through the eye twice, and around the standing lines only twice.  It came second or third to the Palomar knot.  It seemed to me that the Uni should have been less likely to slip, with it's 5 turns around the standing lines...If that was so, then the key to the extra breaking strength had to be passing the line through the eye twice!  I started tying a ""twice through the eye"" Uni.  I also thought it was called a ""Double Uni."" but it is what they are calling a Fishing Fool. Please Note that their diagram is upside down. If you put the loop on the bottom, you will see that it's a Double Uni!. It's also much easier to tie with the loop hanging down rather than above the knot as it is illustrated. I use this knot on multi-hook baits where passing the lure through a loop was a challenge.  Recently, I have acquired a Tie-Fast nail knot tool and have been experimenting with it. I have decided to use Fluoro leaders this Summer. I wanted a splice that would go through the guides easily and settled on the nail knot splice... On Knot-Wars the Gryp knot, which is the nail knot used to tie on a hook-eye etc. was defeated in the second round. I now tie the Gryp with two turns through the eye and think it might be the best knot of all. Since I might have invented it, I will call it a Grryp knot, that's gryp with 2rs...HAHAHA. The big advantage over the Double Uni or Fishing Fool is the tag end is inside the knot where it can't be cut or damaged. This knot is very quick and easy to tie using the tool.  It can be done without a tool, but I would just use the double uni."
310440,mbac31,2009-02-24 23:26:00,904,I use this knot with my Crankbaits and Topwater baits only. Gives it a straighter pull while fishing. It has to be done right though or its very easy to break.
310550,holdfast,2009-02-25 02:15:00,1813,"Ive found that different Knots work for different lines, especially the 2-6 lb tests.  It doesn't even matter what Brands either.  Ive had it more often than not I would use a Palomar and it would break at the Knot.  Id try a Clinch Knot, same thing.  Then I would double my line and use a Double clinch.  That's my last resort as it usually works.  If it still breaks at the Knot.  Its Rotten.  Palomar knots are easiest to tie at night I find."
310552,irishfield,2009-02-25 02:21:00,26272, Just remember it doesn't hold with braid !!
310558,Sinker,2009-02-25 02:30:00,8692,  I've never had one slip. Its the only knot I use to.  Sinker
310559,BillM,2009-02-25 02:37:00,17367,  Clinch knot
