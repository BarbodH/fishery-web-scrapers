Special Seminar: Opportunity for All. An evening with Shane Mahoney    We are very fortunate to have a special seminar speaker in Kingston this Thursday evening at 7:30 PM at Queen's University in room 1101 of the Biosciences Complex (follow the signs on the main floor).  Shane Mahoney is an excellent speaker and anyone who is interested in issues associated with fish and wildlife conservation should definitely attend. He will be dropping by Queen's after addressing Parliament in Ottawa on Tuesday.    Born and raised in Newfoundland, Shane Mahoney is variously described as a philosopher, scientist, humanist, writer, and gifted orator. In fact, he is all of these things. He has emerged as one of the most recognized and influential personalities in North American conservation today. Shane has been the keynote speaker at virtually every major wildlife conservation and sustainable use conference held on this continent in the last decade, and is in increasing demand at international venues, both for his scientific expertise in wildlife management and his unique ability to communicate the relevance of our hunting and angling engagements in modern times. He has also addressed both the Canadian Parliament and the U.S. Congress. Recognized as a chief architect and champion of the North American Wildlife Conservation Model, Shane Mahoney has lectured throughout the world on the importance of the sustainable use approach to wildlife and fish conservation, and to the preservation of human cultures and traditions that have explored and maintained this earliest dependence on the planetâ€™s wild resources.  Shane has received the Public Service Award of Excellence from the government of Newfoundland, has been named one of the ten most influential conservationists in Canada by Canadian Geographic Magazine, was awarded the 2008 International Conservationist of the Year by Safari Club International, the Gold Medal in Wildlife Science by the Cesar Kleberg Institute in 2007, and has just been nominated for Person of the Year by Outdoor Life Magazine.
