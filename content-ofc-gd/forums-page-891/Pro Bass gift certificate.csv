310768,BillM,2009-02-25 18:19:00,17367,Check the back of the card?  Or check their website?
310790,Lunker777,2009-02-25 19:08:00,866,"is it pro bass or bass pro ? haha if you look on the back under the small print, there should be an exp. date ! I know there was on mine I got at Xmas"
310797,charlesn,2009-02-25 19:19:00,551,"I'm looking at the back of a few I have and they do not have a hard-coded expiry date anywhere.  However, they do stipulate that if there is a balance on the card, non-use of the card for a 2 year period will make the entire balance void.  I assume that when the card is ""activated"" the balance is placed and you have 2 years to use it.  These are the Bass Pro Cards with the red maple leaf on the front.  I'd give BPS in Vaughn a call and find out.  They can probably do something for ya.  Good luck."
310804,diggyj,2009-02-25 19:31:00,548,"New regulations state, that they can not expire."
310809,Grimace,2009-02-25 19:36:00,2020,Law says they can no longer expire.   It's the old scam sell a bunch of gift certificates at christmas time that expire in early January.   I was very happy to see that the government put a stop to it.
310810,bassjnkie,2009-02-25 19:38:00,1101,"From what I understand, You have 2 years from the date of purchase. BUT, If you use it before the 2 years is up, then they give you 2 years again from the last use/purchase. Then so on. I don't think card expire anymore.  To check if you card is still valid check here: https://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...p;addCards=true  The value shown is in US funds."
310826,DT10Sam,2009-02-25 19:56:00,480,"This is from us a retailer the gift certificates do not expire it is considered cash and should always be honoured.  Regards, Sam"
310865,steelheader42,2009-02-25 21:03:00,44,Thanks for all the info....
310932,Burtess,2009-02-25 23:32:00,901,"There should be a toll free number on the back of the card that you can call and key in your card number, it will tell you what your balance is.  Burt"
