310887,GeorgeJ,2009-02-25 21:43:00,207,I just got back from Canadian Tire and looking through the fishing stuff noticed these lures that look like fish nothing unusual till you read the package and discover they have a blinking light in their belly. Are these new or am I showing my greener side here again?
310890,diggyj,2009-02-25 21:46:00,548,"Those ones do work. If you know who Boyd Duckett is, he caught his fish on a Laser Lure during this years CLASSIC. They definately work, the real ones are expensive. Here is a link.  http://www.basstackledepot.com/laser-lure-...crankbaits.aspx  There are tonnes of them available. I have seen at CT and Walmart.
