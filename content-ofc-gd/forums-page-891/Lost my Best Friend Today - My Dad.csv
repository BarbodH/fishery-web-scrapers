He took his last breath as I was hugging him .  I will cherish that till the day I die!!!!!!!!!!!

This helps me a lot.

My father had been fighting lung cancer for the past year and a half getting chemo & radiation treatments.  Was admitted into a palliative care center about 5 weeks ago, it ended today at 12:25pm.....  Will never forget the last weeks spent at his bed side.... he was a fighter and even today, fought to the very end... he just didn't want to let go....  The hardest part for me was to see him gasp for air all the while our family was there, including his sister that is celebrating her 79th birthday today.  He definitely got great care and I'm thankful that his suffering ended.... I just could not stand seeing him that way anymore.  Might be selfish on my part but he is now in peace and watching over us.... Will miss him dearly.  Jacques aka Leechman"

Think of it this way. You were ready to lose the company of someone dear to you for his own peace & comfort. Now you're comforted because he's not hurting any more, not because because you were hurting. There's nothing wrong with feeling that way. Don't beat yourself up over it. You cared.
