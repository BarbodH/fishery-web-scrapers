310268,kemper,2009-02-24 16:19:00,2232,played with it a little. Gimme a break i'm ignoring my accouting homework    
310269,dobee,2009-02-24 16:25:00,301,nice fish man... & nice rod... custom?
310270,highdrifter,2009-02-24 16:25:00,2534,Hey I like the handle!!  Is that a custom build?  Nice feesh.  HD
310272,MJL,2009-02-24 16:30:00,2427,"Very nice Kemper  Hopefully I'll be able to make it out this weekend  Don't worry too much about accounting.  When stuff doesn't balance, stick the remainder into cash"
310275,kemper,2009-02-24 16:37:00,2232,"   Yep, custom handle. I love how the rod looks, but it just doesn't perform how I had planned. I cheaped out on the blank and it bit me in the ars. Beauty for smaller steelies (5lbs and less) but anything bigger and fresh kicks me pretty hard.  Thats okay, I got a new stick in my sights!  Thanks for the compliment on the build though, it seems to attract a lot of attention on the river as well. Not bad for a first build id say"
310310,jdmls,2009-02-24 17:59:00,575,nice ice breaker bud  Reel looks sick on that real seat !!!  You killed me with those texts that day LOL !!!  This weekend could be a very good possibility .... Keep in touch towards the end of the week

310380,silvio,2009-02-24 21:22:00,433,wow killing me bro killing me I am sure I can try to get out this weekend.
310394,Joeytier,2009-02-24 22:05:00,3990,"I've only made it out once since the thaw on Saturday, but didn't get anything.  I'll probably fish Wednesday or Thursday evening assuming the warm temps don't make the tribs too high."
310471,tibbs,2009-02-25 00:19:00,650,"Beauty Rod, Reel, and Fish!  I'll probably be out on Sunday."
