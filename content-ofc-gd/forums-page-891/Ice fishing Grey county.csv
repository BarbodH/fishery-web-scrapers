309856,Bitsmith2k,2009-02-23 13:53:00,396," we've fished Arran and Chesley.. there were guys catching on Arran, unfortunately it wasnt us..  mike"
309863,rhare,2009-02-23 14:24:00,387,some great lakes to be fished through the ice in grey.  get a stocking list from the MNR and you should be good to go.

310087,jediangler,2009-02-24 00:58:00,1923,"I think there is ""no ice fishing"" on Chesley. There are some good sized perch in Eugenia, I can vouch for that."
310212,cambo,2009-02-24 13:59:00,62,"Thanks guys, I fish  Eugenia a lot in the summer for bass, always thought about ice fishing there. Perch i've caught in the summer tend to be smaller in size. The ice near the dam would probably be unsafe I am persuming."
310369,duckdog,2009-02-24 20:57:00,162,"Chesley is good for small eyes and aaron for perch, the harbour in the sound when it actually freezes can get you some whites, give me a pm, I used to live in Owen Sound and fish grey county a little bit on the ice"
