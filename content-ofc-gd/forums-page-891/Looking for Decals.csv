I have been looking and looking on line but cannot seem to find anything local......I was really hoping that maybe there was some where in the brantford,hamilton or GTA erea that allready had decalls like this made up. I am needing them A.S.A.P  As i am getting ready for an event in two weeks time...  This is my new cart i bought in the fall last year & any help would be very much appreciated...    Thankyou so much.  Nauti."

310785,xeon,2009-02-25 18:51:00,350,"http://www.artcal.com/decal.html  These guys are in london, make sure to ask for a quote and see how well their product will hold up on your carts surface (stainless steel?). You'll notice that they already have a maple leaf hotdog sticker there so if you get that one or similar, you wont have to pay for design time.  You can also try http://www.have1.com/index.php?p=Products/vinyldecals theyre in owen sound.  Something like what you want will probably have to be silk screened though too, so its gonna cost a bit of money ontop of the design and vinyl cost.  If I were you, Id skip the whole local thing and goto concessiondecals.com where you got the two stickers from anyways. Just ask to see how long it will take to get the stickers to you. And it will be a heck of a lot cheaper than to go the local route."
