310758,12pointer,2009-02-25 17:45:00,10,hi im looking to put a kiker on my boat but it is a bass boat style so i cant mount the motor directly on the transom.i will prob need a motor bracket any1 know of any good brackets?i was also wondering what size kiker i should get for my 17 foot aluminum boat?thanx!
310765,Fang,2009-02-25 18:14:00,1330,on bigger water with any kind of wind I would say no. I run a 17.5 creastliner and used a 6HP for a couple weeks on temagami as a kicker. I found on many days out there I would have liked a bit more power to battle the wind.  If you've got one use it. If you're buying I would go bigger.
310766,grt1,2009-02-25 18:14:00,638,"I just got a flyer in the mail from Proctor Marine in Simcoe. they have a trolling motor bracket on sale for under $100. I have one of the same kind and the bracket is well made and sturdy.  If it is a heavy boat you are trying to push with a kicker, don't go smaller than a 9.9"
310770,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-25 18:22:00,10439, I agree 9.9 is IMHO optimal. You can even use it to power a zodiac or 12 foot tinny for smaller waters. I'm looking at a 9.9 and zodiac for flyouts and kicker for my 18 footer.
310773,fishhunter,2009-02-25 18:23:00,604,i run a 9.9 high thrust on my 23' charter boat great in all types of winds. as for the bracket make sure you use the one for 4-strokes about 3-500$. do not use the 100$ ones!! if you need any help pm me
310775,lew,2009-02-25 18:28:00,12766,"I'll agree with the others that you may want to go a bit larger on the horsepower.  I had a 6HP longshaft Merc on my 1650 Crestliner and while it would push the boat along perfectly for trolling, it had some difficulty turning into a strong crosswind unless I cranked up the throttle."
310827,taper,2009-02-25 19:57:00,611,My father in law runs a 6 Hp 4 stroke on his 16 foot bow rider and it is fine on normal days but a little light in the wind. I have an 8 Hp high thrust on my 17 foot bow rider and even in big waves it will allow for easy steering. The high thrust is designed to allow you to steer a larger boat at idle or just above in the wind.
310851,tizfun,2009-02-25 20:29:00,292,I ran a Yamaha 4hp 4 Stroke on the back of my Princecraft 167 with a 90 Yamaha.. It worked perfect.... Transom was wide enough..  I really miss her..     TIZ
310966,fishhunter,2009-02-26 00:54:00,604,hope this helps you http://www.thefind.com/sports/info-4-stroke-motor-bracket
310979,Terry,2009-02-26 01:22:00,14456,"I have a 5 hp 4 stroke on mine and it pushes it just fine never have to give it much gas  but unless you have a good deal line un on the 4hp, it never hurts to go bigger"
310983,PERCHER,2009-02-26 01:30:00,787,Like the others have said If you don't have a kicker as of yet I would go bigger.I run a Yamaha 9.9 high thrust on my 17ft Lund .No bracket was needed .And works great steering in tandom with my main motor.You can even add a Troll Master so you can control the speed of the kicker anywhere in the boat.I guess the weight of the boat would make a difference as well.Lighter boat smaller motor. 
311002,Mike the Pike,2009-02-26 02:06:00,3421,I myself just use a 2hp Honda with a long shaft it does a fine job. full throttle it pushes  my 16 foot Lund 4.5mph  I don't fish the great lakes so I don't need bigger. it has performed well for me even on a decent chop on Quinte.  Your boat however is fiberblass and much heavier you could always try out the 4 horse if it does not work out then sell it and go bigger.  Good Luck  
311019,stan_133,2009-02-26 02:53:00,77,i'm looking at buying a kicker same as you bud. i've call a few places and only bass pro has called back about the bracket i need to get the motor on my boat. i forget the persons name but i was told that to have it installed and parts for a 4 stroke kicker would cost about $650 before taxes. i'm looking to get the 6hp not not the 4 hp 4-stroke though.
