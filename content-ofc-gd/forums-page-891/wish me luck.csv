310167,ctdd2006,2009-02-24 05:08:00,531,Went through the same thing a little over three years ago!   Awesome.  Buckle up and make the best of it!  You'll never forget this ride!  All the best and congrats!  Cheers!
310387,Leecher,2009-02-24 21:49:00,7832,"I know exactly what you are going to go through.... 13 years ago was the same scenario you just described.  My wife was 2 weeks late.  Had an appointment at the hospital, packed the car with our stuff and the way we went.  What I can tell you is that you will feel a little anxious but in no panic, not like the stories you may have heard.  When we got to the hospital, we were directed to a room and waited for the nurses to come and prep my wife for induction.  While we were waiting, we could hear the yelling of other mothers in labor and we looked at each other and laugh.... don't ask me why we did that cause I don't know.  But when the medication started to take effect, it wasn't funny anymore for my wife cause the contractions were getting more intense.  In the pre-natal course we took, they showed us different massage techniques that would help pass the intense contractions and though I give it a shot, seeing my wife was doing the breathing like we were showed but as soon as I put my hand on her shoulder, she immediately said: "" DO NOT TOUCH ME ""  That was it for me,  could not do anything else except wait and walk the corridors with my wife  It was a very special moment that I will not forget and wish you the best of luck. Hope this will help you and your better half Jacques aka Leechman"
