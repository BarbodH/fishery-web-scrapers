69941,JFR,2007-05-10 12:12:00,498,"Closed during the week, but will be open weekends."
69943,Terry,2007-05-10 12:24:00,14456,thanks well that good..I was worried.... I only use it during the weekend..Misfish may not be as happy
69963,misfish,2007-05-10 13:09:00,29133,"Launch is open on weekends,but the parking sucks. I use the other as it,s wind protected and free to Barrie Residents. One thing I,ll say ,atleast we(Barrie) offer a free launch. Would be nice if other towns did that south of us,with parking.I know theres one,but I wouldnt launch a dingy there.LOL"

I went to put the boat in the water tonight after work and true, Tiffin launch was closed.  Went a km up the street hoping the booth was closed because I had no $$$.  Got there just as they were closing (7 p.m.).  Guy informed me it was free anywho to Barrie residents...then I come home and read this!  Guess I've been under a rock the past few years."
