IF they ever make a fishing boat..I'm in. The turns those things make are crazy! I'd bet you could convert one of them into a decent fishing boat quick enough.....hmmmmm.

70731,bigfish1965,2007-05-12 02:41:00,3382,I was watching the one video and thinking the same thing..half throttle and does a donut on the water. Dang. Hold on boyz!
70764,Northhunter,2007-05-12 05:18:00,214,"I think a lot of the people who get hurt/killed on them are inexperienced.  The jet/impellor has a lot to do with it - if you get in a jam and take your hand off the throttle as a nervous reaction, you just lost your steering. Someone who's a little more confident on one can turn on a dime and get out of a hairy situation.  The momentum isn't too bad if you're doing donuts or 180's and that type of thing, provided your in the drivers seat. If you're a passenger and further from the machines center of gravity, HOLD ON!"

70826,POLLIWOGG,2007-05-12 15:14:00,835,Its the age restriction that cut the accidents down. Some outfits would rent them to kids with no experience and it was an accident waiting to happen.
