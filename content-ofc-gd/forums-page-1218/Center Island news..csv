70199,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-10 21:30:00,0,Did anyone hear the latest news? They are thinking of turning Parts of the Island into a red light district(legal prostitution). What does everyone think of that? I think that they'd at least have to move center Island first!  Or did anyone see the New frozen burgers called Webers???I wonder if they are the same webers on hwy 11!!!!

70311,Rizzo,2007-05-11 01:57:00,4754,"21 years ago I was unfortunate enough to discover a nude gay beach on the island.  No sir, won't go back not even for fishing.  Ouch, 21 years ago man am I getting old"
