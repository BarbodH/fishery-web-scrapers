68912,Greencoachdog,2007-05-07 23:52:00,8163,That'sa pretty nice Goldfish ya caught there!
68923,Carp,2007-05-08 00:13:00,1488,Awe shucks. Those fish are too pretty. You just can't catch carp as ugly and fat as me anymore.  The swimming bulldogs I like to call them.  Keep at 'em.
68994,Weeds,2007-05-08 02:34:00,782,"Hey DSN, I tried sending you a PM yesterday but your personal messenger is disabled. Found a spot you might wanna try out."
69000,007,2007-05-08 02:43:00,537,Good job dsn - still the GTA carp king.  Nice action shots.  How you don't lose more fish though while you're taking the photos I will never know LOL.  I tried to PM you too but MJL explained why I couldn't - totally understand your reasons.  Good luck with the pollen allergies too. I might try the islands tomorrow after work - still trying for my first carp of the year.  007
69082,lazybum,2007-05-08 13:03:00,142,You must be using new equipment to be able to haul them in and take pictures at the same time. Got rid of the ugly stick?
69104,Victor,2007-05-08 14:23:00,1609,still going at it eh  ... i need to find some time to get out this week ... and hopefully i'll have a report to post soon

70472,ccmtcanada,2007-05-11 13:45:00,7971,"Nice carp!  Even though it was ""short"", the pics fill in where the words didn't.  I love your pics in your reports!"
70637,dsn,2007-05-11 22:10:00,1018,  yikes only two posts and you know I have an Uglystick? Word must get around quick. LOL   dsn
70638,dsn,2007-05-11 22:13:00,1018, Sorry but it isn't the uglystick as of yet. Its the Shimano EXAGE S.T.C.TE I'll only use the Uglystick when fishing for the bigger carp at the island.   dsn
