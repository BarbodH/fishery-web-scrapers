69816,mikeymikey,2007-05-10 02:14:00,376,"Hello everybody!  Here is my First 2007 fishing report.  My first time fishing for Pike. My first time fishing at the Toronto Centre Island. My First time using baitcast setup.  Date is May 9th, mainly cloud covered weather. Arrived at the Ward's Island around 8am'ish and started fishing right away walking toward the Central Island and to Hanlan Island.  Since it was somewhat cloud covered, I wanted to try top-water lure but did see any action with it.  So I switched back and forth between Rapala Husky Jerk & X-Rap and had a good luck with it.  I have to say, way pikes go after baits are very exciting. Yet I was some what disapointed with fight it gave.   Pike gave up fight real fast and just get dragged in but goes nuts when i put it on the ground.  All I can say is, it was a lot of walk around the island but it was very worth it as my FIRST experience was extremely satisfying!  Here are the proof...  The 1st...   2nd...   3rd...   4th...   5th...   6th...   and the last...   Thank you."
69819,mikeymikey,2007-05-10 02:15:00,376,"What I want to know is...  -----  One more thing, is there a proper way to hold a baitcast reel/rod? My hand get tired quick, maybe my hand is too small for this reel? Wrong grip?  ----- oh one more again... How long before these pike bite again? after being hooked."
69823,Mike the Pike,2007-05-10 02:23:00,3421,Oh ya I 've caught lots of Pike with that colour Rapala.  WTG on catching your first Pike.  If you get a big enough Pike it will give you a decent battle remember the fish are a little slower when the spring water temps are cool so the fish may not always want to tango.  Thanks for the report  MTP
69824,Victor,2007-05-10 02:23:00,1609,wow seems like u had a great day! i don't know much about pike fishing but thanks for the report!
69834,urbanangler1990,2007-05-10 02:40:00,933,"nice!  this makes no sense, i was out all day, even left tdot same time as u, lol, cept we began at hanlans, and got nothing nor seen anything, oh man, even used same lures, ad7&^&^d7, only diff is the color on ur husky jerk,  congrats...."
69839,urbanangler1990,2007-05-10 02:42:00,933,"well, the reel should be up, not below like on spinning rods, if ur like me, reel with right hand, and hold the rod in left, then yeah, my left arm gets tired..."
69841,Mike the Pike,2007-05-10 02:48:00,3421," URBY,Don't you get it the Newbies catch all the fish, beginners luck it happens all the time.Thats fishing"
69843,Rizzo,2007-05-10 02:49:00,4754,"Congrats on the first pike and a succesful outing.  You're right about those hammerhandle pike...hit hard then have the same fight as a wet worksock.  Wait till you tie into a big one though, all of a sudden they seem to figure out the fight thing"
69846,urbanangler1990,2007-05-10 02:51:00,933,"  if i really think about it and calm myself, lol, then yeah thats right, i know... sorry yall, i apologize for misdirecting ur report"
69853,frozen-fire,2007-05-10 03:11:00,542,"wow, maybe it is beginners luck at the islands. i'm hooked on pike now after my first outing yesterday!"
69867,007,2007-05-10 03:38:00,537,Congratulations on your first pike from the T.O Islands.  There seems to be plenty of those small ones around this year (not that Urban Angler or I are catching nay of them LOL).  Wonder where the large ones are hiding?  007
69994,b2kptbo,2007-05-10 13:59:00,1505,"Was a good day, thanks for the report..."
70052,ehg,2007-05-10 16:14:00,2666,Seven pike is quite an accomplishment considering all thoe firsts!  Most of the big females go back into Lake Ontario after they spawn.  Great report!  ehg
70067,tbayboy,2007-05-10 16:40:00,1497,Wow what a great job for all those firsts (as ehg already said).  Seemed to be all about the same size from the pics and that seems to be about the average with the odd monster here and there based on the recent reports.  Last weekend the small ones seemed to be putting up a decent fight to me - lots of flipping in the water (and on land but we've all seen that story - healed nicely now thank you).  I think you've convinced me to try out my baitcaster though - its been gathering dust as I don't want to drag out two rods and find out I can't use the damn thing.  Maybe this is the weekend to learn  Thanks for the report.
70069,Terry,2007-05-10 16:42:00,14456,nice jog  must be grass pike....lol
70074,Peps,2007-05-10 16:48:00,191,"good job,       Peps"
70078,Headhunter,2007-05-10 16:54:00,5703,"My thoughts exactly Terry! I don't want to rain on your parade here, but I'm pretty sure that those Pike would have a better chance at getting to be much bigger if they weren't left on the grass/dirt. They're slippery buggers and can be a challenge to hold... practice make perfect! HH"
