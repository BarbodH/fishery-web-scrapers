70742,bigfish1965,2007-05-12 03:39:00,3382,At this point we are going to look into the matter a bit more. We no longer can tell where the majority stands and we no longer have a consenus among admins. One option being thought out is that all viewers can see linked (using IMG tags) but only members can make uploaded images pop-up into fullsize. We do have a problem with people using uploaded images on other web sites. Since we cannot watermark the uploaded images (yet) we use up bandwidth without any return. We do thank you for your input and it is very much appreciated..especially to those that gave thoughtful responses.
70735,kennyman,2007-05-12 03:00:00,737,"Very well put Brian! I agree. Even if you wanted to restrict image viewing is requiring 10,20, or even 50 posts going to be that much of an encumbrance? Seems kind of pointless to me."
69990,Jen,2007-05-10 13:54:00,833,"The reason I chose to join OFC was because of the way people treated one another.  I understand your desire to control something, but seriously, if you close off viewing to the general public, how are you going to attract, not only new members, but advertizers etc.  Just my opinion. Leave it the way it is , because obviously , it is working.  Cheers, Jen"
70000,tonyb,2007-05-10 14:06:00,1637,"Yep, the site is flourishing as is.  Keep it free, keep it public, just don't post fishing reports or pictures of spots you don't want thousands of people a day to see.  Tony"
70064,Hookset,2007-05-10 16:29:00,367,"5 guys fishing in a bath tub....complaining because a mess was made, and pictures were taken, from their side of the tub.  That's how I see it, sorry if it offends, but are we really considering changes to the board based on this ?  My ""bath tub"" statement refers to the general area causing the majority of the debate, when compared to the size of the rest of Ontario. Shore Angler's in southern Ontario are in a tough spot. My sympathies are with them. I do not see how changing something on this site will make a lick of difference. It's a respect thing. Most of us learn that by the time we are 5 yrs. old. Some will never learn.  Please don't change the site.   Hookset."
70136,Entropy,2007-05-10 18:47:00,747,Is there a verdict ??  I kind of like it the way it is.  Blur if you feel you need to.  Post if you want to.    Entropy
70137,Entropy,2007-05-10 18:48:00,747,Is there a verdict ??  I kind of like it the way it is.  Blur if you feel you need to.  Post if you want to.    Entropy
70142,snag,2007-05-10 18:55:00,1932,"I know it's annoying,  But should we politely inform people to be a little more discreet when a bad photo appears were the spot is pretty obvious (easy to find within 3 feet???)  Kinda the same way we remind people to not do a vertical hold, post OOS catches, etc.  What think you."
70143,irishfield,2007-05-10 18:59:00,26272,How many people have you seen arrive at the ferry holding a picture in their hand like a treasure map snog...off load and then search the island like they're on a treasure hunt and the picture marks the spot..... other than when you did it using ehg's pictures that is.....
70148,John,2007-05-10 19:18:00,2956, Thought you were outta here by now...........
70153,Fishnfiend,2007-05-10 19:27:00,357,"I'll give my $0.02. I apologize for not reading this entire thread (in case someone else has suggested this).  If there is such a big concern with reports and pictures, then just make a 'reports' section that one must earn their chops to gain access to.  Pretty simple."
69558,tonyb,2007-05-09 15:18:00,1637,"I voted yes, to contributing members only.  I rarely post the results of my outings here anymore.  It's a lot of work to constantly try to remember to not reveal backgrounds and/or edit the pictures prior to posting them on OFC.  I used to share a lot more but complaints from other members about my reports and/or inviting higher than normal traffic at my fishing locations is not worth it.  This site has turned into the equivalent of drive-thru fast food but for fishing reports/locations...I don't want to encourage that anymore.  People are spoiled with the Internet, fewer and fewer folks are getting out there and discovering spots and hot bites on their own.  It's worth contributing to others that do the same, but that isn't the case here.  That being said, I understand the goal of this site and I think in it's present state that goal is being achieved.  Tony"
69597,Tdel,2007-05-09 17:32:00,393,"I voted no because before I joined, I enjoyed reading the adventures posted and seeing the fishing pictures.  That is what made me come back time and time again.  I did not visit the site to find hot spots and deplete the fish population in someones ""honey holes"".  I decided to join because I saw that Midland Penetang was not covered by any member and that I could share info that could help someone who wanted to fish the area.  If I had been restricted I might not have joined and would probably have moved on.  I just love it when I see ""PM me and I will give you the info"" and ""changing the background of pictures"".  I think that this pole is directly related to the above.  I think that if it comes down  to ""PM me or changing the background"" then keep the information and pictures to yourself and PM yourselves to your hearts content.  Blocking the background and just leaving a fish in a picture takes away from the whole story.  If I wanted to look at pictures of fish alone I could go to a fish ID site but that is not what I want to do.   Just remember that lurkers are future members who have not registered yet!  Yes I was a lurker before I joined like most of the other members.  Tom."
69600,BryonG,2007-05-09 17:43:00,52,Well said Tom
69614,suds,2007-05-09 18:23:00,70,"I voted no, and the reasons have already been eloquently stated by others that voted no also.  thanks"
69631,aplumma,2007-05-09 19:10:00,6896,"I think that people who want to see the pictures should be able to without having to post any posts, however if they had to join then the family would be even larger. A lurker will lurk forever and return to the site as often as he wants to get info or entertainment without feeling like they would like to return something to the family. How many times have you visited a site and wanted to chime in but it was to much of a pain to join and then speak up. You then continue to read and visit never putting the knowledge that you have into the posts that you found so interesting.  Secondly it would not drive people away from the site if they had to join it would shorten the time they were lurking. The bandwidth would be about the same but with the registered members they would be counted and that is the magic number that allows this board to sell advertisement. The more people that are accounted for (joined)is the sales number the product sponsors want to see. They do not see the guests as a sales base they only see the hits on the site and that is not nearly as easy to sell to the sponsors. The truth be told their are not many that did not lurk before they became members and I bet most of you joined to ask for help or information. I say lets give them a reason right off the bat to join and support the forum with their being counted and maybe the cost of this site will be easier to pay for.   Art"
69690,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-09 22:00:00,191,Just bought my ticket to moose factory  I'm gonna find those spots!   LOL!
69701,Gerritt,2007-05-09 22:34:00,6129,There is a simple answer to this.... Rick... how many unique page views do we get a month...... and how many are Members.. I bet a loonie... no 100 Loonies that non-members outweigh members by at least 50-1    so we have 50 non members taking info... how many of them register? 1 in 50 perhaps? a community is just that people that talk and share.... not leech an leave.  Hate to be the thorn... but this is my opinion.   Gerritt.
69703,misfish,2007-05-09 22:44:00,29133,"Well Ger,I think I made sence of that and totally agree.Like I said sometime ago(and this is in no offence to the owners or mods of the site)Private boards are becoming more and more common and if you do not pertake in the inputs, your are out.  Just my 2 cents on this."
69705,irishfield,2007-05-09 22:46:00,26272,..and the one that threw you out Brian is down to at most 30 visitors a day.
69421,OhioFisherman,2007-05-09 05:39:00,6623,"LOL, if you have to cherry pick your spots off the web you haven`t spent enough time fishing! Chances are if you went to those spots your results wouldn`t be good. You can learn more fishing long, hard, and often!"
69429,Northhunter,2007-05-09 07:31:00,214,I voted no. Won't go into a rant over it but vance and bassman's posts are the only ones I've read that have similar thoughts.  I've been here a long time. The post count elitest thing (not sure what else to call it) is something I despise everywhere I see it.  This is a fishing board. They are pictures.
69435,SlowPoke,2007-05-09 08:17:00,2984,"I voted no. Part of the reason I joined this forum was for the reports. Active members sharing advice, techniques and good ole fish porn.  I am of the opinion that; -if a person recognizes the spot (s)he's already been there. -if you want to protect your spot, take care not to reveal too much.  Restricting images will do nothing to keep poachers away nor will it clean up the shoreline from inconsiderate anglers. Can we even quantify the damage caused by these 'revealing' images? Of coarse not. Because it's plausible, it doesn't mean it's a problem. I think restricting images is a knee-jerk reaction for something that may or may not be a problem.  -Brian"
69436,solopaddler,2007-05-09 08:44:00,8605," I actually voted yes with a minimum number of posts, but was probably a bit rash in my decision...In retrospect I agree with Brian. It's really up to the individual to not reveal too much. For the success and health of the board in general it's probably best not to change a proven formula. My guess is if these changes were instituted less people would join and the board would stagnate.."
69439,Photoz,2007-05-09 09:05:00,792,"I long to have the 'good ol' daze' back, where you could take unrestricted pictures, trade info openly, and share everything. But . . . .    the 'net & it's countless info sites got too popular . . . .     you show a photo of a nice fish, and where you got it . . . .     literally within HOURS it was 'elbow to elbow' as the great unwashed couch potatoes decended in hordes, trampling everything, leaving garbage, and not returning a single fish, not even a minnow, to the water. A good example . . . .    the park over by the causeway on Scugog used to be a great place for families to fish . . .. .    you could even get a few pickerel, bass, carp, perch and other small panfish from shore. The last 2 years, I never saw ANYTHING caught near shore within casting distance . . . .    most of the shoreline was taken over by people who strung lines out from shore several hundred feet, to anchored buoys, and with multiple hooks . . . .     you get 10 people doing this, 50' apart, nobody else can fish, and they get everything that swims! Just one more family shore spot fished into oblivion! I hesitate to even post a fishing picture now, no matter how well disguised it is, (and if I must go to great lengths to disguise it . . .    why bother?) for fear somebody recognizes it, and reveals it on another board with NO restrictions, and even GPS waypoints are allowed! I think it's a great idea if you must take the time to register, AND contribute, BEFORE getting access to ANY info! The actual fishing related threads with good pics are getting fewer & fewer, soon there will be NO shots of fish being caught . . . .    if they post 'em at all, it'll be when they get 'em home, and it'll be done in the back yard! This is progress?"
69443,Marc Thorpe,2007-05-09 10:01:00,621,"Well,I think OFC has always been open to all public viewing and over the years that is what has made this site its strength.  I fully understand and share  the view of Snog ,Xrap and misfish,but I think we should heed his advice this coming season and consider angles when taking pics.Not regulate or privatize the site  To block out pics to all,in my view is defeating the purpose and what made OFC,we might just loose some of those viewers I agree not all lurkers are on the honest side,but so is some of our friends,aquaintance and family members.Somewhere you gotta say,who cares,so be it Its the responsibility of the poster and pic taker that should consider somehow not to show the background. Its up to the lurkers whom use this info to respect what they have found There will always be people trying to rip and reap from others,there will always be those that seem to come out of the closet,some that will follow you,at some point you address it yourself.I dont think OFC needs to be involved in this type of control,afterall we also are the public in which this board has come together to be  I think sharing your reports and trips is a personal choice,I think the education of what could happen if your not privatly carefull  is the responsibility of the poster,not OFC I am of the thinking of Snog and Misfish,I dont post much reports if any,because at times its my family time or friendly fish,I have dealt with the negative side of people whom cant do things for themselves or just ask,they prefer the sneaky way,in the long run I have found its not me that really lost or got ripped its those that endeavored in the actions that did themselves in  Possibly suggesting a propsoed way of taking pics or cropping would be an alternative  I voted no  Either way I am easy"
