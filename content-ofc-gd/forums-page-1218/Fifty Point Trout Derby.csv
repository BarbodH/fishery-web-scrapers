My apologies to anyone fishing. Ended up putting her leash on.  First time wetting a line in about 8 months. Couple others around me were landing trout on worms as far as I could tell. Hope to make it to the derby tomorrow but have an appointment to have a hitch put on our new vehicle. Shame too, whether is going to be perfect."
