70006,lovetofish,2007-05-10 14:17:00,500,"Decided to head to Toronto Island with a good friend of mine, to see if we could get into some of the pike action we've all been hearing about.  We just missed the fairy by five minutes, so we ended up catching the 11 O'clock fairy to the island.  And it wasn't until after we went to get a slice of pizza, that we got into some action.  Since we had never been there before we were trying to cover lots of water.  As soon as we got to the water after lunch, first cast for both of us and two fish landed and released.  Mine being my second biggest pike(guessing around 34"") and my buddy with a little hammer handle.  As soon as we moved down a little further we got another two small pike and that was it for the day.  My buddy and I were both very impressed with the fishing and the scenery there and hope to be able to go back soon.  Here is some of my pics.  My second biggest pike       A little guy     And some of the scenery     Thanks for checking out my report!  Lovetofish"
