So, I left and went to the ""lake ontario"" side of the conservation area and fished an inlet to the marina.  4 casts in, on a perch coloured spoon, I hooked a nice brown trout!  It was not my first time fishing that spot, but I've only ever fished there for smallies.  First time going after the big ones...  Anyway, started off bad, but with a little patience I landed my biggest ever brown trout.  Unfortunately I didnt bring my camera cause I was only expecting bows for the day.  Cheers all!  Mike"
