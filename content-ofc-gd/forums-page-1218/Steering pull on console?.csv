Except for having to change some hoses with the live well, every thing else went great - except I noticed a really hard pull on the steering wheel and I had to put a fair bit of effort into keeping it going straight.  Is this normal? Is it the wheel off-setting the rotation of the prop? I've only hd experience with higher end console boats before and don't recall this.  Thanks"

70518,specktacklure,2007-05-11 16:01:00,56,just make sure you turn the tab in the direction that the boat is pulling but rick made a ggod point as well so try the trim first then adjust the tab.
