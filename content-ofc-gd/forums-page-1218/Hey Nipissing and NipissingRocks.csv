70562,Andy,2007-05-11 17:58:00,330,Just wondering how things are on Nipissing and area. We had some nice showers down south of you a couple days ago. I know you didn't have a lot of snow last winter and was wondering how things are shaping up for the opener. Andy

70642,pigeonfisher,2007-05-11 22:43:00,696,I was in north bay on Wednesday and the bugs were BAD anywhere with trees.  Water level looked fine.
70693,Bernie,2007-05-12 01:03:00,3190,Hi Andy. Im on an island on the south bay. Not a bug in sight tonight. Water level is perfect. We had some showers yesterday and this morning so its looking great for the opener. Good luck next weekend!
