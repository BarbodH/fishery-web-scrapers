70469,irishfield,2007-05-11 13:39:00,26272,"Well nobody else can claim it. We know it's the only diagonally decked dock on the lake, thanks to the gal that boats the Hydro Meter reader around to every place on the lake. I'll find it Terry I'll find it."
70473,Terry,2007-05-11 13:46:00,14456,news Flash  someone hooked onto it and towed it away

70293,Terry,2007-05-11 01:18:00,14456,well if he runs there from Temagami it's a long way but he will be able to check up on his place on the way..doesn't seem to be on the lake though must be more grass pike
70296,Greencoachdog,2007-05-11 01:23:00,8163,Calamari?.. care to field this question???
70320,walleyejigger,2007-05-11 02:16:00,876,"from the pictures i've seen, i'd bet there's great places in eyesight of your dock, you just gotta get out there and try"
70325,irishfield,2007-05-11 02:22:00,26272,I don't have to leave the dock wj...my best fish have been caught off of it. Was just adding some humor to the recent Bull around here....and Dawg...we've had this conversation before... lol

70361,Jen,2007-05-11 03:33:00,833,"Mind taking a picture of your dock and pm'ing it to me ???  ???    Cheers,  Jen"
70362,irishfield,2007-05-11 03:35:00,26272,    I have no issues with public disclosure! lol
70366,GbayGiant,2007-05-11 03:45:00,1780,"Try that one rock, near the small weed bed, by the drop off, close to the sandy shore, beside the gravel bottom with the slow current eddy and timber pile to the left of the creek mouth.  I herd it is a great spot."
70367,irishfield,2007-05-11 03:46:00,26272,  
70409,Whopper,2007-05-11 11:06:00,2174,Way to funny Wayne!  Whopper
70410,Terry,2007-05-11 11:09:00,14456,Hey I think I know where those shoes are.. lets not show too much detail in your photos...people will know where all the good spots are   so I'm looking for a spot with shoes and a tire at the dock....this should be easy
70413,ccmtcanada,2007-05-11 11:32:00,7971, Love this picture!  Glad to see you had the drawbridge put in for that family of ducks that like to use this as a short cut.
70417,Cast-Away,2007-05-11 11:39:00,790,"Terry, does it look familiar now? I thought for sure that you or way would have figured this one out!  Map link"
70426,Terry,2007-05-11 11:51:00,14456,I knew where it was....lol
70445,Fang,2007-05-11 12:41:00,1330,Wayne  with that new boat and plan e you should be able to reach just about anywhere around Temagami now  Spitzig lake (just off spawning bay) is just full of pike - loads of 4-8 lb fish and the far north end bay is loaded in the spring  Far end of spawning bay is good in the grass flat just in front of the river that flows out of spawning lake.  both shorelines in kokoko bay for 500 yrds past the last A frame cottage.  and of course there's always the very far end of Shining wood bay. As you near the far end there is an island. Start on the north side of the island and troll back west out of the bay for 300 yrds. TRurn arouind and go back.
70450,irishfield,2007-05-11 13:06:00,26272, I dont need to move in...I live right around the corner cast away! They give me day passes.  Thanks Paul...can't fish spawning or kokoko for another week.
70453,Guest mistyriver1,2007-05-11 13:14:00,0,"Love that shot of the dock Wayne, very nice.  You must be really excited to get up there.  Jim"
