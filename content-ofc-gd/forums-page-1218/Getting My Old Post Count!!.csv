Is there anyway to get this back?  whenever I post now people think I am a newbie (not that there is anything wrong with being a newbie), however; I have contributed many fishing reports to this site and given sound advice to atleast a few people.  Regards, Mr.Wonderful (aka JohhnyNoFish)"
70140,snag,2007-05-10 18:50:00,1932,"Back of the line, NEWBIE!!!   How do WE know you're the same Mr.Wonderful?  What if your really just an imposter? Like, uh,   Guy Okay, or,  Mr. Moderately good?  You're really asking a lot here.  Where's the Mr.Atlas Avatar????Hmmmmmmmmmmm"
70149,leighfns,2007-05-10 19:21:00,103,  Check out the avatar now...  That should be proof enough
70173,leighfns,2007-05-10 20:13:00,103,Do I need  to contact the admins?????
70212,irishfield,2007-05-10 22:22:00,26272,Yes..Rick or Roy
70224,Roy,2007-05-10 22:43:00,13728,"Don't bother Rick, he's a busy boy. I don't remember any Johnnys with two H's in their name. You joined in November and to date you have NINE posts! How long were you on the old board to get 200-300??? I'm pulling your leg. Because I'm such an easy going dude, I added 200 posts to your count. I hope it makes you a better angler."
70235,leighfns,2007-05-10 23:00:00,103,  It certainly will not make me a better fisherman ....   I have not posted much lately as my fishing season is just getting started again.
