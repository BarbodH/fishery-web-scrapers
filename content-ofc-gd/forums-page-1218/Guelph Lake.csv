70156,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-05-10 19:29:00,34,"Going to Guelph Lake for Pike sunday morning.  I have never been before, soooooooo...............   Any tips / suggestions, things to watch out for?  Is it a decent Lake?  Specific tackle suggestions?  Would I be better off hitting Bellwood?  I will be fishing my scanoe with a 40# Maxxum trolling motor.  Appreciate any feedback.  Chris"
70158,Raf,2007-05-10 19:32:00,3495,"Not sure there are pike in Guelph.  Bass, carp, catfish and panfish.  Belwood would be my choice."
70162,easton13th,2007-05-10 19:39:00,371,"Guelph Lake offers the novice or pro-angler northern pike (trophy-sized), smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black crappie, yellow perch, and carp. Anglers can fish along the shorelines or from a boat. Only electric motors are allowed, no gas engines. Hydrographic maps are available at the gatehouse for ten dollars. Ice fishing is available in winter. (quote from the site)  http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cf...=126&sub2=0  Easton"
70222,jediangler,2007-05-10 22:36:00,1923,"Guelph lake is a great choice for pike as well as crappie and bass. Try around the island and any tree growth that is submerged at the base. Using spinnerbaits and spoons as well as crankbaits can be productive. With the cold front coming in Friday night you might want to go to jigs and sluggos to slow down your presentation a bit. This pike was taken on a football jig with a spider grub while fishing out of my Sportspal from Guelph a few years ago. It was 35"" long and 10.5lbs. You should have seen the faces of the European guys on shore when I released it. They were almost in tears.  Buy the map at the gate, it's worth every penny. Good luck PM me if you have any questions."
70424,jediangler,2007-05-11 11:47:00,1923,"If you go to Guelph, try up the creek arms in the stump fields for big crappie. My buddy Goatboy caught this 13.75"" crappie on Bass opener 2 years ago while flipping a jig into the stumps. It was released after the photo. "
70478,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-05-11 13:57:00,34,Thanks Jedi!  I will be getting the map at the gate.  Hope to have a good report on monday morning
70534,Blake,2007-05-11 16:38:00,418,Great fishing there for sure.  For Panfish look at the Phenix minitubes and the Technium stinger baits.  they work great in there.  Fishing World had some last time I was there.
