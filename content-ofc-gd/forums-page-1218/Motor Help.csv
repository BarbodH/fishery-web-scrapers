It also dies during idleing. But it works fine when i put it into a slow speed and then when i pump the fuel by hand with the pump it picks up some power and just takes off.But it doesn't do it itself,  Also if i slow down to like almost ideling speed it turns off again., anyone know what the problem maybe? thx"

70282,Bernie,2007-05-11 00:58:00,3190,Sounds to me like you have at least a fuel flow problem. Fuel pump or plugged fuel filter are possibilities. Also could be a dirty carburetors. Was a fuel stabilizer added to it last fall? Bad fuel is another possibility. Deposits can form in carbs that restrict fuel flow through the small jet openings.

70304,irishfield,2007-05-11 01:41:00,26272,Skip my advise...was more for an older small outboard. Does sound like the fuel stabilizer advert on TV. I'm told Hondas are probably worse for plugging jets if you don't use stablizer and Yamaha is a close second.
70305,Bernie,2007-05-11 01:41:00,3190,Good point Big Cliff! I usually dont figure that until the motor quits.
