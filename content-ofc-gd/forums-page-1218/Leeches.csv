70532,Blake,2007-05-11 16:34:00,418,I like using the Berkley Gulp leeches in black.  They last longer and work great for eyes.
70587,FinS,2007-05-11 19:29:00,463,i know a guy in michigan who has em but they cannot be brought into ontario i suggest if you really need em they can be found anywhere throughout ontario make yourself a leech trap add some raw meat and you should be in buisness leeches are nocturnal so its best to set your traps early in the evening and check em before sunrise find a whats his name or small pond that is knee deep in your area that dont hold fish and you might be in luck  Good luck finding 50lbs
