70180,Steelcat,2007-05-10 20:26:00,191,"I took the 8am ferry to Ward's Island.  While I was in the ferry, there was a VERY nice lady with a dog sitting across me.  She politely asked if I was going to fish.  Then she suddenly ""ordered"" me to move away.  I asked her why, and she replied, ""Why are you killing all the fish?  You know fishing kill will kill things right?""  She then asked me again, ""Can you go paint a bamboo as a hobby?  Painting a bamboo will not kill~!""  I just ignored her and moved on.   An interesting way to start my fishing day..... After I arrived, I immediately started to cast my lures.  Saw several Bass and one Pike cruising along the shore.  I tried to target Pike until 12pm, then I changed to target Carp.  I was using corn under a float, after the corn enter the water, the Carp started to appear.  I was getting all excited since my corn attracted them to group around.  But then I realized there's something wrong.  They were circling my float as if they were dancing a ""We don't wanna eat your corn dance"".  Then I saw some bottom disturbance close to shore so I slowly reel my corn to the area, within a second, my float went under..... I was all excited, then I saw a bullhead.  Overall I caught two bullheads, 13 inches and 15 inches.  At least I caught something today............  I'll for sure go back and try my Pike again  The lovely Toronto Downtown  A huge dead pike  Reeling in the 13 inches bullhead  The 15 inches bullhead "

70190,Golfisher,2007-05-10 21:06:00,586,"And I bet that nice ""lady"" never killed a single thing in her life, not even a virus.  Sheesh."
70192,urbanangler1990,2007-05-10 21:08:00,933,"thnx for report, ull get em soon..."
70266,dsn,2007-05-11 00:00:00,1018,hmm that cat looks pregnant.  or could it be all the corn I stuff him with. Yeah the carp are getting tougher in there.  Nice fat cat.  dsn
70275,fish4me,2007-05-11 00:26:00,59,"I went this after noon targeting pike, managed 1 only, clean and nice, but small.  Carp are starting to spawn, they are in there now, tough to catch, mostly on the surface."
70326,Rizzo,2007-05-11 02:22:00,4754, gee wonder what gave it away!
70328,irishfield,2007-05-11 02:24:00,26272,I would have asked her if you could borrow her dog for a wee while...
70471,ccmtcanada,2007-05-11 13:43:00,7971,"LOL about that lady with the dog...should have told her that even though it looks like a fishing rod, it's the latest in fencing gear.  Then go to jab her dog and see what she does... j/k of course.  Sorry to hear about the carp....but that 15"" bullhead sure is a big ulgy fish!!! When I'm being skunked, I'll throw a worm on a hook and bottom fish...most times I pull a bullhead out...makes me feel better....haha.  Great report!"
70552,Headhunter,2007-05-11 17:32:00,5703,I would have told her Jesus was a fisherman and was she insinuating that he was cruel and heartless? HH
