Most of us...in fact nearly all of us, if faced with the following dilemma...  Veterinarian: I can save your dogs life, but it will cost $200.  ... we would almost instantly get out the chequebook or credit card. But when faced with saving our own lives, somehow $200 is too much. Inflaters are non-intrusive, dependable and can save your life. You don't even know you are wearing one. Many, many times I've got home from fishing only to discover I still had the inflator on. Forgot I was wearing it. It's not just YOU that you have to consider. It is your family, friends and kids. Each May long weekend there are drowning deaths in Ontario of fishermen. We know it is going to happen. When we see it we all wonder...why were they not wearing life jackets? At the very least please always wear your PFD when the boat is underway.  If you still think it is not a big deal, ask your kids, your wife, your parents and see what they think. If you don't owe it to yourself, you at least owe it to them. Thank you for posting such a timely reminder!"

Me and the other guy were able to swim back to shore pulling the canoe and gear. There was nobody around to help us either. It was long and cold swim back."

70059,Golfisher,2007-05-10 16:24:00,586," Well, that explains why my wife has been so insistent on those PFDs."
70075,mdej,2007-05-10 16:49:00,98,"Whopper,  Good on ya for reminding us that we should be wearing some version of a life vest.  I appreciate you bringing up the topic so that when my nefews read this they are reminded to wear the life vest whenever they are on teh water.  Personally I'm horrible at wearing mine.  However when in the boat alone in motion I do wear it.  I force the GF to wear hers at all times when in motion (she's not a good swimmer).  And most of the time she just leaves it on.  I'm planning on investing in a manual inflatable vest style this year, hoping I can wear it all day and not have it bother me.  Think the sexy tan marks that would leave."
70096,Whopper,2007-05-10 17:18:00,2174,"mdej your response is exactly why I posted this thread in the first place. If this helps anyone at all the purposed is served.  I do wear a PFD while fishing alone while underway in my own boat, otherwise I pretty selective on when I wear one, just felt that I should have been wearing one last Sunday anywho.  Just for the record though at no point all weekend did I ever feel unsafe on my buddy's boat, he does such a great job handling rough water.  Already decided that my next purchase will be and inflateable that I will keep in my boat bag (and for those of you that know me my boat bag goes were ever I go) for the future for such conditions. Rick your totally right and that is one of the reasons that I felt so bad about this in the firstplace. Every year we hear about people drowning and say to ourselves this could have been prevented by wearing a PFD.  I'm sure that if I was to asked my wife (not that I would have to   ) for some extra money to purchase something that would keep me safe she would be glad to. I hope  Whopper"
70179,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-05-10 20:24:00,0,"Let me clarify things a little bit here. Our great Canadian government passed a law a few years ago that require all charter operators or guides to have life jackets and not PDF's for all passengers. I spent over $300 getting 4 adults, 2 kids and 2 for smaller kids at that time.  So by law I must have on board a life jacket for all passengers. So I keep 4 on board ( 3 of them fill my biggest compartment and one under the dash in case of emergency ) at all times and bring kid size ones when needed.  So if I was to get an inflatable I would have to get 4. And yes that's a lot of cash.  And Irish my boat is only worth 60K you are referring to yours."
