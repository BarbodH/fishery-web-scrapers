Was wondering if anyone has fished in jamaica (negril) and if there are any recomendations for fishing guides and charters. Im more interested in fishing the flats then deep sea action but any help is appreciated. Im staying at the Riu tropical bay.... Also what tackle should i bring for messin around off shore with my extendo rod? thanks guys and good luck out there
