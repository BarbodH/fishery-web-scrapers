I am trying to register and send him a msg but when I fill out the form and go to the next page, it asks me to fill in the security letter/number combo.  The picture doesnt show.  Doesnt matter how many times I refresh, I just see either a red x when I use IE or when I use firefox I get the little symbol with the shapes in it when it wont show a picture.  I have tried right clicking and selecting show picture with both browsers and no luck. I tried to email myspace but when I bring up the contact us page it has 2 drop down boxes.  The first one says pick your topic which I can do.  But the second says pick your subtopic and regardless of the topic I pick there are never any suptopics to pick from, and it wont let me go any further without picking one.  I have tried changing my firewall settings but that didnt work either. Any ideas?"
