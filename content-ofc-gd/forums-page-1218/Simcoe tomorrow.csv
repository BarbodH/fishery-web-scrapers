70513,icefisherman,2007-05-11 15:48:00,952,"It's this time of year again...Simcoe opener tomorrow...bright and early in the morning. Anyone heading that way? It'll be nice to see some familiar faces.  Speaking of the gas prices though, and my wife not willing to get up early in the morning I could use a partner in the boat tomorrow. Preferably from the West side of GTA. Someone willing to split the trip cost and early riser   feel free to PM me with your contact info. I'd say good fighting chance to get few nice fish in the boat ;-) The sooner we make plans the better. Good luck to all who are going tomorrow and hope to see lots of you on the lake.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
70516,misfish,2007-05-11 15:58:00,29133,"I,ll be heading out from Barrie up to the shoal then down to cooks bay for some pike and try for that elusive walleye.  Down side,15 k out of the N/E."

70595,icefisherman,2007-05-11 19:41:00,952,"  misfish,  I'll be in a 16' white Peterborough with 60HP Johnson on the back. I'll be launching from JP or Sibbalds PP. Will be watching the weather tonight, as I am considering going on Sunday vs. Saturday. Should be only 10K wind on Sunday...if you can ever believe the weatherman though  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
70623,Fisherman,2007-05-11 21:41:00,7201,"Just be careful out there, just took a look at this, http://www.theweathernetwork.ca/weather/ci...es/CAON0259.htm, I think I'll try and keep breakfast inside, no feeding the fish.."
70653,Rob,2007-05-11 23:26:00,467," I'm heading to Sibbalds Point PP and launching from there. Last year they were calling for 20km winds and it was dead calm there most of the day. Good luck out there tomorrow Brian, get some whities for the smoker!!  Talk soon, Rob"
70656,icefisherman,2007-05-11 23:40:00,952,"Well,  those guys here: http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/city/pages/...1_metric_e.html  have dropped the wind forecast starting tonight...I have a feeling the weather network has no idea what they are talking about AGAIN!!!  Anyhow...what time does the JP launch opens in the morning (someone is there to collect your money)? What do they charge now? I know it's going to be zoo there but it's closer to the fishable water then the park.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
70701,misfish,2007-05-12 01:15:00,29133,"Well Im still good from here in Barrie.Feel the need to jump some waves,if they come up. See ay out there."
70713,Skud,2007-05-12 01:48:00,739,I will be in Cook's Bay piking from 11am till 7pm tomorrow. Walleye fishing Sunday morning else where.
70718,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-12 01:56:00,0,"I may be there with Grilw(greg) too tomorrow, but we may change our minds and go else where last minute. Look for the silver alumacraft in cooks bay."
70793,misfish,2007-05-12 13:17:00,29133," Hey Skud,I should of went else where today.LOL"
70796,icefisherman,2007-05-12 13:23:00,952," ha ha misfish, I decided to go on Sunday because of the wind today....but guess what...it says right now it's only 11K wind...I should know the weather man NEVER knows what's going on. Forecast for tomorrow is 10K wind...will not be surprised if it is 20K ha ha ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
70817,misfish,2007-05-12 14:50:00,29133,"The only problem leaving from here and it,s an east wind,it has all that water to work up those 3-4 ft swells once it reachs the bay.  I need about another 2 ft of boat to ride them.LOL"
