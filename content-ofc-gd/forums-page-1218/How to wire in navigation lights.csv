70568,Fisherpete,2007-05-11 18:28:00,1814,"Hey guys!  Looking for some advice/input on how to install a bow & stern light on my new boat. The boat is a 16ft Tracker utility boat, no fuse panel or things like that. I have the lights already, and attaching them to the boat itself is no problem, and they both have electrical leads. Where do I go from here? I guess my questions are:  1) what kind of wiring to use, and where to get it 2) where to get some kind of toggle switch to turn lights on/off 3) which battery should I attach it to (starter one or deep cycle trolling motor one)  Thanks!  Would outdoor type wire from say Home depot do the trick?"
70573,Terry,2007-05-11 18:37:00,14456,"you can use an old extension cor,d any type of switch will do canadiantire will have a SPST  switch and depending on how long you leave the lights on and if your motor has a charging system..... I would go with the deepcycle unless you only use them when the motor is running"

70585,easton13th,2007-05-11 19:26:00,371,The only suggestion I would make is make sure the wire is oil and gas resistant. It will not corrode as fast.  Easton.
70599,POLLIWOGG,2007-05-11 19:54:00,835,"Canadian tire carries the 2 position switch, one position is the all around white light  and the other is all the lights. The extension cord would make a neat job of it and probably cost less than a roll of wire."
70606,Fisherman,2007-05-11 20:22:00,7201,"Like Polliwogg said, switch, Off/White/White,Red/Green, 16ga stranded is sufficient with a fuse on the +12V where it connects to the battery before the switch.  Try to position the switch to keep it out of the rain/spray, they tend to corrode easily."
