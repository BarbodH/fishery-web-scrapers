Small cities of ice huts pop up around Lake Nipissing during fishing season and tell a story about the people who live there for a few months every winter.  ""Just had sex, and it felt sooooooo good,"" says another phrase printed on one of the walls, punctuated by a happy face.  Callander filmmaker Kevin Hoffman directed Shackville, a three-minute look at the fleeting communities beached on the shore in spring as they wait to be hauled away until the next winter.  Hoffman's film is screening at the Rural Route International Film Festival in New York City celebrating rustic realms around the world.  He thought the festival would find something unique about these temporary ice hut societies.  ""There's a real abstract feel to it,"" Hoffman said.  Shackville features a young girl, played by his 16-year-old daughter, Sydney, who is swept up by the mystery of the makeshift communities and their inhabitants.  Clouds and rain greeted Hoffman's first day on the shore, and he brought his daughter along for the ride the following sunny day, creating different moods in the short film.  He created Shackville for the A Lure exhibit that continues until Saturday at the Alex Dufresne Gallery and Callander Bay Heritage Museum celebrating the business and pleasure of fishing on Lake Nipissing.  The film isn't Hoffman's first screening outside of Canada.   He worked on The House written by lead actor Jim Calarco, of North Bay, which was shown at international film festivals in Milan and Mexico where it earned a Silver Palm Award.  The three-day Rural Route International Film Festival features ""green"" agricultural films, documentaries and fun short films.  Shackville will be screened Aug. 7 at the Museum of the Moving Image.
