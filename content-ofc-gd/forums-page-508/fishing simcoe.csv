606845,Terry,2011-07-27 19:33:00,14456,"Well I decided to get out and try the boat to see if it is finally repaired  I have to thank Paul from Top Gun for repairing it..every time I took it to him it ran great..we went for a run on the lake with him and for an hour of starting and stopping it ran great..so how do you fix something when nothing is wrong......well he finally found the problem and fixed it..he did a lot of work without charging me and through in some used parts trying to figure it out......  my trolling motor died the day I was to take Misfish out on the river...Rockey in Orillia fixed it for me in 2 days.....warranty work..nice  so off I go everything worked great however I wanted to fish for whitefish and lake trout but it was just to windy and way to many waves so I stayed in cooks bay and played with my underwater camera  you would not believe how many sunfish and bass and rock bass there are in cooks bay, I moved about 10 times and over 2 miles totol but everytime I dropped the camera I saw fish..lots of fish fish everywhere it is just crazy it was hard to record because the waves were lifting the camera up and down..the camera was turning as it pulled through the weeds  I caught about 8 bass but spent most of my time watching the fish <a href=""http://s27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/?action=view&current=P7270001.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/P7270001.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/?action=view&current=P7270003.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/P7270003.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/?action=view&current=P7270002.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c177/Mrtbeee/P7270002.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>     <iframe width=""425"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/l1-SDPMfIaU?hl=en&fs=1"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

606851,John,2011-07-27 19:45:00,2956,Cool vid Terry. You would think there would be some monster pike in there with all of that food!
606853,motion,2011-07-27 19:49:00,403,Glad to see you finally got that boat going. Rockey's a great guy. He has helped me out a few times in the past.
606856,Jigs,2011-07-27 19:51:00,136,Nice. Love seeing underwater footage. Is that an aqua-view?
606858,Terry,2011-07-27 19:54:00,14456,this is it it's a no name but works well  http://cgi.ebay.ca/150ft-Underwater-Video-Camera-Motorized-0-360-View-/350375574954?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item519402fdaa
606860,Joey,2011-07-27 19:55:00,9122,Well I'm so glad you got your problems solved and got out fishing Terry.  Cool video too and some nice bass you caught!
606877,fishnsled,2011-07-27 20:20:00,3520,  I was thinking the same thing. Some good food for a big toothy critter. Great news on the boat Terry and the underwater footage is always great. Thanks for the report. Now put the boat away and get packing!!
606879,Jigs,2011-07-27 20:25:00,136, It looks great. Really decent resolution.  I paid twice that for mine a few years back and it's black and white and doesn't record.
