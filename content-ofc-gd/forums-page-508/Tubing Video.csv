I'll make a separate post in the photo section with all my photos once I'm back home.  I've really been working on my video editing lately for reasons that some of you may know(if you don't, you will in the near future) so here's my latest edit...Shot on GoPro, edited with Adobe Premiere...Enjoy!  <iframe width=""640"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/0lyOvfKThLI?hd=1"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

Great editing.  I'm still trying to figure out what program to use to get to veiw it on my computer, real player isn't that great, and adobe isn't doing anything for me????"
