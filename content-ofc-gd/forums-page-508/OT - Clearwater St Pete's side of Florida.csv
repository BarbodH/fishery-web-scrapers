We are looking for something with cooking facilities, swimming pool, not necessarily beach front; a good price and excellent condition. Trailer parks are ok. Any good recommendations or warnings of where or what to avoid would be greatly appreciated. bayboy"

Lots of bridges and piers to wet a line.  Great seafood restaurants.  Awesome sunsets, etc.  Have a great time!  PS.. Just remembered, about a half hour drive south of you is Sarasota Beach.  If you're a beach goer, you'll love it.  Sand is like powder!  Also Mote Marine Laboratory is in Sarasota and it's a neat place to see sharks and other sea life."

Just don't go to the small joints expecting Trump Tower and you'll be fine.  this is a good link  Staying in motels on the intracoastal side of the island is a cheaper alternative to beach front and the beach is no further than 2 or 3 blocks away. There are a couple of inexpensive restaurants there and a Publix grocery store on the island just before the end of HWY 60, also a Walgreens in Clearwater Beach. And the peir is right at hand  The Sea Captain is pretty decent, Sandman I just discovered is now history as well as the Sea Cove. My sister and husband stayed several time at the Ritz across from the beach.  Enjoy your trip south...and don't forget med insurance!  Probably a good opportunity to at least see this area before it becomes too expensive."
