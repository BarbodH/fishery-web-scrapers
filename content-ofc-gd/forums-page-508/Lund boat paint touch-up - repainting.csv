The paint on one side was rubbed off in many spots by another boat which was not tied properly while docked on a lake. I called many places (Lund dealers / auto body shops) and none of them do the painting. Does anyone know a good place which does a good job in boat painting?  Also the graphic sticker on the boat is damaged, I guess I will have to order it from Lund.  Thanks in advance!  Alex"

607022,irishfield,2011-07-28 00:49:00,26272,Find any good local paint shop that has PPG on their paint rail. That is what is on the boat and I'll try to dig up the paint codes as I have it somewhere.  Yes.. and Lund dealer can get you the decals.
607073,alexw,2011-07-28 02:51:00,74,Thanks everyone for your responses! I will give it a try.
607075,irishfield,2011-07-28 02:54:00,26272,Here is the old post I put all the paint codes in...  http://www.ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=31340&hl=%5cpaint+codes%5c
607076,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-28 03:00:00,1107,Lund also posted on their FB page that they are looking into getting a dealer program to carry touch up and order paint for repairs but that was only a month or 2 ago prolly not up and running yet .
