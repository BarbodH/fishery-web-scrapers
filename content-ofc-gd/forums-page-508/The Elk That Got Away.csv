607184,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-28 14:42:00,10439,That's pretty cool but I have seen an even better one. It was on a hunting show back in the 90's. The archer was 1/2 way up a fairly open slope with scattered pines and the guide was higher up the slope calling. The hunter was facing down slope hiding behind a tree when a big elk came along and rounded the tree. He came right up to the hunter and put his nose on the guys shoulder and took a big sniff!!!!!
607190,cjgraham,2011-07-28 14:51:00,104,Oh man that would have been awesome. There is that one out there too of the guy moose hunting. Moose comes in about 6 feet. Guy shoots and the bull charges him. Here is the link to that one.  
607274,jedimaster,2011-07-28 17:41:00,3472,There is another oune of a moose licking the broadhead ofthe arrow while he has it in this bow. Too bad he didn't have it pulled back.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-1uYxXLmNs
607302,OutdoorDan,2011-07-28 18:22:00,325,"Does that last video posted by jedi look fishy to anyone else? It's been around for a while and I've pondered it a bit. The guy looks fake and more like a store mannequin. He shifts a little (unnaturally) at the very beginning of the video, then is perfectly still - usually with videos like this you can see some movement from breathing. If you look closely at the way this ""guy's"" hat sits on his head, his hair and ears, as well as him thumb at the end of the video, these all look really fake. I think it is possible that this is just a dummy decoy with a broadhead that has been scented with attractant."
607303,Jds63,2011-07-28 18:33:00,1365,"wow amazing ""Holy Crap"" videos"
607304,jedimaster,2011-07-28 18:34:00,3472,"I dunno, you can see the guy blinking. must be a really good robotic one if it is a fake."
607308,OutdoorDan,2011-07-28 18:38:00,325,I didn't catch that the first time. I might need to get rid of my tin foil hat.
