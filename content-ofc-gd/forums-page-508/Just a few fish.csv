606132,Dara,2011-07-25 19:57:00,3052,Hummed and hawwed about heading out the other night after work and finally went for it.  We wouldn't normally keep so many but its been a long time since we brought home a meal.     the Pike came first after not even 5 minutes trolling and then before we finished the first pass we had a double header.    I think I may take another shot at them again tonight.
