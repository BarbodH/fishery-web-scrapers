606938,irishfield,2011-07-27 21:43:00,26272,In the lake would be a start..  I know there are smallies in there for sure and supposed to be Lakers as well !  BTW.. if you have a site along the river/creek between Lake of Two Rivers and the Mews you'll be able to paddle right up to your site from the lake.

607016,irishfield,2011-07-28 00:33:00,26272,"I caught a few smallies over against the South shoreline, where the walking path goes the length of the lake. Probably some out around the island as well. Take some weights and try the deep center for Lakers as well.  Just checked the neighbouring lakes and Mew is supposed to have Brookies and Smallies in it. Pog lake is supposed to have Lakers and Smallies in it."
