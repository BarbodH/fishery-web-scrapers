606750,mike rousseau,2011-07-27 15:59:00,4661,I spoke with the MNR enforcement department... And you are only allowed 1 possession limit... And if you catch them in a zone  where the limit is 6 and take em home where your limit is 4... Your ok...  And if you have your limit... Catch and release is ok
606753,mike rousseau,2011-07-27 16:03:00,4661, If the fish is gunna die... And you have your possession limit...By the rules you can't keep it... Where I live a legal musky is 48 inches... So if a 47 dies on me... I gotta let it float down the river and rot...
606758,beginner,2011-07-27 16:09:00,542,thnx mike... that answer the question...
606767,jimmer,2011-07-27 16:48:00,2730,Just go fishing already! LOL
606769,beginner,2011-07-27 16:49:00,542,
606636,beginner,2011-07-27 12:37:00,542,My family and friends are planning to go this weekend to Niagara falls and we want to grill fish... So I pitch in and said I have 6bass in my fridge the last time I went fishing... My question is:  1. Am I allowed still to throw some lures?? 2. Is the 6bass still my limit and I cant fish anymore?? 3. or this is just my possesion.. but not my daily limit...  I know this is not a brainer question but I need ur expertice  thnx bfisher
606637,johnnyb,2011-07-27 12:39:00,3413,You have your limit.  Start eating
606639,beginner,2011-07-27 12:42:00,542,I know eh.. lolz but I was trying to save it for the weekend.. and still I want to throw some lure in the shore... if I have time..
606641,Jer,2011-07-27 12:47:00,1426,"The possession limit pertains to where the fish were caught, not where you might actually physically possess the fish."
606643,johnnyb,2011-07-27 12:51:00,3413," Correct, but once you are in posession, you are in posession, and no matter where you go to catch more fish, you still have your limit.  Cut and pasted from the regs:  Catch and Possession Limits – The catch limit is the number of fish you are allowed to catch and keep in one day and includes fish that are not immediately released and any fish eaten or given away. The possession limit is the number you are allowed to have in your possession on hand, in cold storage, in transit, or anywhere. Possession limits are the same as one day’s catch limit except where otherwise specified.  Many many threads about this on here....simple and easy answer: read the regs"
606646,beginner,2011-07-27 12:52:00,542,"okay.. let say we ate the fish in lunch time.. possesion gone, right?? thus it mean im back with the limit??? lolz this is confusing lolz"
606649,Jer,2011-07-27 12:55:00,1426,"   It's up to the ""authorities"" to prove that they weren't. Otherwise, by that logic, you wouldn't be able to leave the lake on Balsam with a legal slot-size fish that would be an illegal slot-size in the rest of zone 17.  No."
606652,beginner,2011-07-27 12:56:00,542, that is hard to answer too... they might think ur lying to them... ur in zone 15 and you fish in 17.. complacated.. i guess picture of the place.. would be one proof..
606656,Jer,2011-07-27 12:59:00,1426,"If you have a four fish limit from one zone in your freezer, and are now fishing in a zone with a six fish limit, can you keep two more fish?  That's one I'm not sure about. Logic says yes, but regs have very little to do with logic sometimes."
606657,smally21,2011-07-27 13:00:00,993,didn't we have this conversation over about 200 posts a week ago? sinclair are you trying to start somethin'??
606658,Jer,2011-07-27 13:01:00,1426,"  Hopefully, in our supposed free country, the ""authorities"" wouldn't automatically assume you're lying."
606661,beginner,2011-07-27 13:03:00,542,thnx for the answer guys..
606690,adolson,2011-07-27 14:27:00,783,"A simpler solution for possession limits would be to make it a single limit per species, province-wide, that is higher or equal to the highest daily catch limit for the species in the province. But I don't make the rules."
606700,Nipfisher,2011-07-27 14:37:00,2449,"For those who are not aware of the regs. Not directed at O.P. or any contributers to this thread. Just F.Y.I.  Catch and Possession Limits – The catch limit is the number of fish you are allowed to catch and keep in one day and includes fish that are not immediately released and any fish eaten or given away.

606710,beginner,2011-07-27 14:56:00,542,meaning I cant fish for that fish  because I have the possession limit and it was considered to be a daily limit too... nice lolz
606711,irishfield,2011-07-27 14:58:00,26272,bf.. you can gift those fish to someone else in your family.. just sayin...
606713,Grimace,2011-07-27 15:00:00,2020," Different bodies of water deserve to be judged on their own merit.  Province wide limits is lazy and irresponsible.  The MNR does their due diligence to inform us on the sustainable catch limits for each region and body of water, the least we can do as anglers is do our due diligence in understanding the regulations.  It is not that hard.  It really isn't."
606716,beginner,2011-07-27 15:10:00,542," Thnx irish, you give me an idea... Im not trying to catch another limit, is just that while we are having lunch and some rest.. I was thinking throw some lure, I dont know about anyone but if I see water?? light bulb??? fish....."
606727,adolson,2011-07-27 15:16:00,783," I agree with you about catch limits. Had you read what I wrote, I specifically was talking about possession limits. I don't see any reason why there should be room for confusion with possession - those of us who actually want to follow the regulations might get screwed because it really is not clear, and there is room for error, potentially causing issues for those with no ill intent. A province-wide possession limit would solve that, while retaining the catch limits of individual zones and water bodies."
606728,beginner,2011-07-27 15:17:00,542,you sure?? I heard before that when you reach ur limit you cant targeted those species... because you may damage the fish and die.. this one is playing in my head... this is why I asked the question limits... so I would be in the safe side..
606731,beginner,2011-07-27 15:21:00,542,ty sinclair..
606736,Grimace,2011-07-27 15:32:00,2020," I get what you mean now.  I haven't thought of that, I would have to think about it more to decide on whether I would agree with it."
606739,smally21,2011-07-27 15:42:00,993,"if you are that worried about it how about stop taking them home? if fishing for you is more about stocking your freezer than the 'thrill of the hunt' just go to the grocery store.  if you had left that bass in the lake, or consumed it the day of the catch you wouldn't have anything to worry about. not sayin you've done anything wrong here, im sure you fished within your limit and nothing wrong with putting some fish in the freezer for a rainy day, and i appreciate your effort to learn more about the regs.  why don't you just eat the damn things and then  go fishing?"
606742,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-27 15:47:00,4399,"   Lord have mercy, I love these threads!!!  I would say you have to wait until you completely digest your limit and then have a bowel movement to be completely rid of your allowable limit, the answers to these questions can get rather silly can`t they!!!"
606748,beginner,2011-07-27 15:57:00,542,"Is not the freezer am worry about, Its the rules about possesion and daily limits...  I was saving the fish this wekend for bbq or grill... being said that.. I know its a possesion and its also a daily limit... I was going to Sinclair said.. I can catch and released... but this catch and released made left me with a question... what happen if a fish was damage and die?? I would be responsible?? Am I right?? Irish said I can give my fish to family... so I would be able to fish without a doubt...  sorry for the stupid question guys I apologize"
