I've been starting to cast the bigger baits alot lately trying to boat my first ski. Headed out with confidence last night and it paid off, well sorta...lol  Can you believe this guy hit a believer...haha  Was working it through submerged cabbage like a jerk bait and this little guy hit like a freight train!
