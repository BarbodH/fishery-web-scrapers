606743,dsn,2011-07-27 15:49:00,1018,Where are all the live bait and tackle store left in the GTA? The only one I know of is on Jane and  below the 401. Opposite of Maple Drive.  Is there any others that out there that don't know of?    Thanks  karper
606776,GBW,2011-07-27 17:07:00,8460,"There is one in Unionville/Markham on HWY 7 between Warden and Kennedy Rd. Here is the address; Bass City Bait & Tackle. 4361 Highway 7 East, Unit 4.  I've been there a few times and a scoop of minnows is a big scoop too.  I even ran into frozen-fire there before."
606779,BFSC Kevin,2011-07-27 17:21:00,1351,there are three in scarborough that i know of... pro j at sheppard and warden lucky fishing tackle at midland and sheppard av fishing tackle at markham and sheppard
606783,beginner,2011-07-27 17:28:00,542,pro j is gives more minnows if you want minnows...  avs fishing is cheaper if you want worms... 2.60d per 2 dozen I think  lucky is stingy
606797,crossover,2011-07-27 17:59:00,172,"The one on Jane (proline taxidermy) is fairly expensive. Anyone know of a cheaper tackle store in Etobicoke? There is also this one called Pagonis, $2 for a dozen worms, its more of an office setting than a tackle shop. According to their site they also sell larvae, roe, leeches, and crickets, all with the option of buying bulk."
606810,bigreddog,2011-07-27 18:35:00,84,"Any of the Angling Specialties locations in Mississauga, Concord and Scarborough would be a good source for live minnows and such.  Angling Specialties 325 Central Pky W, Mississauga, ON L5B 3X9, Canada +1 905-275-4972 ‎  Angling Specialties 3251 Kennedy Rd, Scarborough, ON M1V 2J9, Canada +1 416-609-0804 ‎  Angling Specialties 2104 Highway 7, Concord, ON L4K 2S9, Canada +1 905-660-9707  LeBaron and Bass Pro also have worm/nightcrawler fridges too, if that's what you're into."
606817,BFSC Kevin,2011-07-27 18:54:00,1351,Angling spec is scarborough is now closed
606839,jimmer,2011-07-27 19:30:00,2730,"I don't think there is one in Peterborough anymore, if you can believe it and it's right in the middle of the Kawarthas. Sounds like there is still a few around TO to choose from. Is that larger chain and on-line sales finally having a negative effect on the little guy?"
606982,BucktownAngler,2011-07-27 23:22:00,582,"Fish Ontario at HWY 400 Service center North of Teston Road  they have all size minnows, leeches and worms"
606992,GBW,2011-07-27 23:39:00,8460,Isn't that place the one that is a rip off?
606996,OutdoorDan,2011-07-27 23:51:00,325, Yes they are really expensive. Open 24h on weekends though.
607012,Pikeslayer,2011-07-28 00:23:00,1443," Depends on prices that you pay in Muskoka, Seguin or Parry Sound. I'd say they are cheaper than buying up there and their minnows easily survive the 2+ hour drive. I buy there all the time and have no complaints.  Slayer P.RTRD  BTW, not sure about 24 hrs but they open at 4/5 am during peak fishing seasons."
