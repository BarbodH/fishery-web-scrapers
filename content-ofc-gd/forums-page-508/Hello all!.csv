606426,Pickeral eater,2011-07-26 19:24:00,155,"Hey folks after reading some replies to other newbies I have decided to introduce myself.  My names Bill, I live in the greater to onto area.  I love the outdoors with canoe camping my passion.  Fishing has always been enjoyable but not tops on my to do list when out there until the last 5 years.  I started to go out with friends for opening seasons of trout and pickerel and hit the odd salmon run.  I fish for trout, bass, pike and pickerel on a fairly regular basis, and unlike my user name states it's not always for food lol.  So far I enjoy reading  the positive feedback,  tips and reviews from the experiences many of you have had and look forward reading and learning more. Thanks for now... PE"
