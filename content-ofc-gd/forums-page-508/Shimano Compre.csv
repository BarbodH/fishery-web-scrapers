606820,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-27 18:58:00,4399,"yes my medium heavys and mediums regular action have taken a lot of abuse and everybody knows rods are fragile but we all have bumped and jostled rods into rod lockers,cars seat,ceilings etc. with out issue but this one just snapped very easily. I hope they replace it as I have been a very loyal Shimano customer since I purchased my first Shimano Bantam some 25-30 years ago, we shall see!"
606824,bassman87,2011-07-27 19:10:00,586,i broke mine in similar fashion. was replaced no questions
606830,solopaddler,2011-07-27 19:23:00,8605,Over that last few years I've sent 4 Compre spinning rods in for replacement because the tips broke on each and every one.  Thankfully warranty is good.  I don't use Compres spinning rods anymore though.
