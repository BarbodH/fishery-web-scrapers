I've got the reel and drag assembly removed, as well as the three screw that seem to hold the cover on, but an unable to remove it. Does anyone have any experience disassembling this reel? Thanks"

607108,Spiel,2011-07-28 10:40:00,9065,You found the little release button underneath.
607126,LucG,2011-07-28 12:16:00,779,"No, the cover on the other side. I had had the three screws removed, but the cover was still secure. There was another bar type screw holding it from the other side."
607127,Spiel,2011-07-28 12:19:00,9065,"I see, well you got it off and that's what matters.  Some of my Quantums have a little slide release button underneath the reel."
607141,LucG,2011-07-28 13:02:00,779,"Yeah mine has that do, but thats to remove the cover that holds in the spool etc  I had to get at the gears."
