607060,BillM,2011-07-28 02:24:00,17367,I'll be driving through Wawa in about 2 weeks... Can't wait!
604426,Terry,2011-07-19 18:03:00,14456,thanks for the info....
604440,Joey,2011-07-19 19:08:00,9122," Abbey Normal  Have fun Terry, watch out for them Sasquatch.  Run if you hear knocking"
604447,Terry,2011-07-19 19:27:00,14456,"thanks Joey....as long as I can run faster then the other guy, I'm golden    I still have a week off before the trip   I am hoping my boat is fixed and I can get out finally"
604451,fishnsled,2011-07-19 19:33:00,3520,Have a great trip Terry!! I shouldn't be too difficult to do so.
606159,solopaddler,2011-07-25 20:41:00,8605,"Thought I'd bump this for you despite the pm's.  Surprised no one's mentioned Youngs general store in Wawa. It's a really cool old landmark, well worth checking out while you're there.  As far as the fishing goes ask the pilot to circle the lake a couple of times. Have your map and pencil handy and mark all the spots you see: points, rocks, and especially mid lake humps that would normally be difficult to spot.  I always spend a bit of time at first combing the lake with the graph pin pointing as much structure as I can find and marking it on the map as well.  Once you start fishing a couple of floating markers are very handy to mark the spots, especially the offshore humps.  On a new walleye lake I always troll either worm harnesses or crankbaits to find the fish.  Once they're found you can usually sit on them and pound them on 3"" twistertails tipped with half a worm.  White, charteuse, yellow and pink are all good colors.  Many of these smaller outpost camps don't have proper anchors.  It's always good insurance to bring a mesh bag (replacement landing net) and some rope. Throw in a nice round rock and you've got a servicable anchor.  Also good to bring a big roll of duct tape and some oversized nails.   Both will come in handy pretty much guaranteed.  Another thing I'll bring is half a dozen of those cheap solar garden lights from CT. I'll put one on the dock, and place several more on any major lake hazzards or shoal markers for fishing.  They're fantasticly handy if you do any fishing after the sun goes down.   Have a great trip Terry!  Very very ironically Terry is flying into the very same lake I'm bringing my young family to. We'll be there the week after Terry LOL!  (I'm expecting lots of detailed info from you when you get back. )   On a side note you might find this funny (I know I did).  Check out this piece the CBC did with the Wawa transit commisioner. It starts at the 14 minute mark.  http://www.cbc.ca/thisisthat/"
606165,Terry,2011-07-25 21:00:00,14456,great info thanks  I am going to put all the info and tips to use
606167,fishnsled,2011-07-25 21:07:00,3520, That is hilarious!! I wonder what they were even thinking to try to put that in place. Politics at it's finest??
606173,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-25 21:16:00,10439,  Me thinks the transit commisioner has had a few too many bong hits!!!

606273,HTHM,2011-07-26 01:44:00,4082, Mike you are BENT ! I am glad that not being a resident I will still be able to use TO parks for free. One of CBC's redeeming qualities.
606435,brw,2011-07-26 19:41:00,101,  The MacLachlan's are incredibly nice people and they run a first class operation at MarMac and Camp 88. And I agree about the drive along Superior. I have yet to see a more beautiful area from the Soo to Wawa....
606456,solopaddler,2011-07-26 20:37:00,8605,"  I've flown with those guys many times over the years, definitely cool neighbours you've got!  They run a great operation and have some really outstanding outpost camps.  Say hi to Danny for me when you see him."
606547,Sharkbait22,2011-07-27 00:48:00,297,"Kinniwabi Pines has very slow service.  Expect 2 hrs. No joke.  Food is good, so if you have the time ...  The Motor Inn is ok but 7 yrs ago it was great particularly wing night on Wednesday.  The Embassy and Columbia are alright.  Never eaten at the Best Northern but I've heard that it's good. No real winners.  Beer store closes at 6 except Friday Saturdays at 9.  The coast route is the best. Sultan road gets old real fast. Youngs GS has a great selection of lures and there is a tackle store at the end of Broadway past CTC. Old Woman Bay is worth a few cast right off the beach.  I don't fish for walleye enough to give advice but I'm sure you won't have any problems. Have fun."
606559,Terry,2011-07-27 01:08:00,14456,thanks
606622,solopaddler,2011-07-27 09:37:00,8605,"I'm surprised so many people are recommending driving 17 all the way to Wawa. Yeah it's scenic in spots north of the Soo, but it's also a lot slower going that route. A lot of small towns with traffic lights and transports that are impossible to pass..  My main priority is always getting there as fast as possible LOL!  The Sultan road is by far and away the shortest route. That said when I fly out of Hawk Junction next month I'll be taking 17 to 129 then 129 to 101. I'm overnighting at a small lodge (renting a cabin) just east of Hawk Junction and won't even step foot in Wawa.  The drive along the first half of 129 is also incredibly scenic as the road hugs the Missisagi river.  That route to Hawk Junction is almost exactly 40km's shorter than 17 to Wawa then east to HJ. Not ""that"" much shorter distance wise, but waaay faster because of less traffic..  Just my 2 cents."
606651,anders,2011-07-27 12:56:00,1168," We're not that bad are we?  Is it the smell, what? what is it?  LOL"

606781,cjgraham,2011-07-27 17:23:00,104,I used to work at a fishin lodge just past Wawa. It doesn't matter what you bring up your going to catch fish. these lakes don't see too much pressure. Jigs tipped with leeches are dynamite and X raps work well. Heck we even took spoons out of the kitchen drawer drilled a hole at both ends slapped a trebble on one end and caught pike with it.  Enjoy and have fun! btw the best place to eat in wawa is Tim Hortons.
606786,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-27 17:35:00,10439, That's pretty sad!!!
606795,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-27 17:50:00,2690,  Looking forward to that drive in four weeks!!!!  Have a great time up there Terry!!!  Hopefully you've used up your bad luck for the year
606873,Terry,2011-07-27 20:13:00,14456,"man, Friday can't come quick enough"
606951,Roy,2011-07-27 21:59:00,13728," I think Terry is safe for the rest of his life. Only good stuff's gunna happen now, Bud. You're driving up to get the plane Friday morning? If that's right you only have one sleep left?"
606956,Terry,2011-07-27 22:08:00,14456,no we are driving up on friday morning  flying out saturday morn
607005,RickOnt,2011-07-28 00:10:00,669,"Hey Terry  Have Fun! and Get the ""Big Guy""  Rick"
603649,S.M.05,2011-07-17 19:16:00,145,"I agree with the Sulton Rd. route. I take that way whenever Im head up to that area. Usually stop at the Arctic watershed?? Restaurant (Sultan and 144 junction) for a bite to eat.  As for tackle in Wawa check out the Beachfront Trading post great selectionof tackle, maps and info (14 Broadway Avenue).  Good luck on your trip."
603653,Terry,2011-07-17 19:22:00,14456,"thanks Jacques, good info there  good to know, Bill  I take a drift sock and hope it slows it down enough if not back trolling is the ticket for worm harnesses    thanks selfmade"
603656,northernboy,2011-07-17 19:32:00,13,"The road was generally graded weekly, I was usually going about 80 kph on it.  Just remember logging trucks are bigger than you and probably going faster"
603658,northernboy,2011-07-17 19:33:00,13,"Btw, the water temps up here beside Lakair are a cool 27.4C, and nothing biting"
603659,Terry,2011-07-17 19:40:00,14456,well they have to bite at some point......I hope...LOL   thanks
603684,Leecher,2011-07-17 20:48:00,7832,"Terry,  I'm sure you've seen those on the CTC shelves.... sort of like a drop shot setup but more robost    Once you locate those eyes, give the pickerel rig a shot.... I'm sure you'll like them    They are the perfect setup when anchored Jacques    Here's a link for the specks of it  Pickerel Rig"
603689,Terry,2011-07-17 20:59:00,14456,"Jacques, I have been using them for years and have caught my share of walleye and perch on them  they do work great  at one time that was all I used on Balsam lake for pickerel....but now we call them walleye so I didn't know if we were still allowed to use them....."
603692,Leecher,2011-07-17 21:04:00,7832, Terry    I just wasn't sure if you had seen them but now I know.... greatest little walleye gadget on the planet Good luck on your trip
603694,Terry,2011-07-17 21:07:00,14456,I have always like the ones with gold Aberdeen hooks and used to fish golden shiners or dace with the red strip on them
603696,Leecher,2011-07-17 21:16:00,7832, Since you like trolling..... don't forget the Storm Lures Original Hot'N Tot  Hot'N Tot  The one shown at the top of the page is my favorite They are killer for eyes
603699,Terry,2011-07-17 21:24:00,14456,"I don't have any of them, I will look for some"
603851,Terry,2011-07-18 09:41:00,14456,"anyone else got tips, hints or secret weapons of mass destruction on walleye"
603883,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-18 12:47:00,4399,"Our fly-in is getting closer aswell Terry 7 weeks and counting and can`t come quick enough,people keep backing out!!!   I heard bright colours work best orange,yello,chartreuse. I also heard if you lean over the boat and stick your tongue out they`ll will jump right in your boat!!!  Have a good time there Papa!"
603885,johnnyb,2011-07-18 12:54:00,3413,"Awesome that you are getting up there, Terry....have fun!"
603887,anders,2011-07-18 13:06:00,1168," Terry,  When you get to Wawa the first stop is the beer store, second is heading all the way down Broadway and stopping at Beachfront Outfitters and talk to Marcel he will set you straight and empty your wallet and the same time.  I cannot go in there without spending countless dollars.  Jigs in Pink, Green/yellow will keep you busy on your entire trip, when there pickup some knuckleball jigs...dynomite up here!!  After beachfront, if you still have money left head to the Embassy restaurant.  You will pass it on your way to Beachfront, it looks kind of grungy, but the food is amazing...try to panzarotti! All there breads are home made and made fresh."
603888,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-18 13:08:00,2690,"Looks like you've gotten alot of good info here already Terry. Just want to wish you ""good luck"" on the trip!"
603909,green&orange,2011-07-18 14:02:00,31,Just got back from the Chapleau area.  Water temps were in the mid 70's.  We did well with pitching jigs in shallow weed edges.  Best colors were chart/black/orange.  You will have a great time.  Good luck.  I will second the Columbia as the place to eat in Wawa.
603998,Terry,2011-07-18 18:08:00,14456,thanks guys     I was hoping someone on the board had been to this lake before...but doesn't look like it
604001,BillM,2011-07-18 18:12:00,17367,"Terry, did you mention the lake name?  I must have missed it."
604005,Terry,2011-07-18 18:18:00,14456,yeah I did but it was a few of my posts down   it's Abbey lake
604217,Dara,2011-07-19 02:10:00,3052,"  I moved last year and my new neighbor across the street owns MarMac lodge and White River Air...the old guy behind me used to fly for them and a lot of other airways...could be a neat new hood  edited to add, there is no way I would miss the drive along Superior to save an hour on a gravel road through Sultan and Chapleau"
604266,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-19 06:47:00,0, agreed.  that drive is terribly flat and boring.
604283,lew,2011-07-19 11:12:00,12766,Sounds like it's gonna be a great trip Terry !!
604386,Terry,2011-07-19 15:52:00,14456,I have to stop rereading this thread...getting to excited...............
604398,chris.brock,2011-07-19 16:23:00,4053,"A few years ago, we went with Parks Fly In to their Cam Lk/ Little Missinaibi Lk camp. It's pretty close to Abbey (we checked out the portage from Elbow to Abbey). Can't really give you any great tips, we did well with jigs and twister tails (no live bait needed). If the wind is pounding on a rocky shore, try casting minnow baits into the choppy waves near shore.  I know Solopaddler has been to Little Miss., pretty sure he's at Abamasagi this week though  have a great trip, ask if you want any more info"
603526,Terry,2011-07-17 12:55:00,14456,"30th of July I am flying out of Wawa going with Parks outposts camp  ?1. what is the best route to get to Wawa...up the 400/69 then ? fastest route/best route  ?2. what tackle do you use for walleye and how do you fish them..........any tackle stores or places I should check out in Wawa...best place to eat dinner the night before and breakfast the morning of the flight..  just trying to maximize my fishing........  ?3. what things to you take to make your fly-in trip better that most people/me would forget.   ok maybe I am just getting excited and want to hear a little fly-in chat.......   here pickerel, pickerel, walleye.....pike too  any tidbits can help thanks...........PMs welcomed..LOL"
603529,Dave Bailey,2011-07-17 13:04:00,1641," Then turn left at Sudbury on Highway 17 and keep following it to Wawa. But whatever you do, don't do"
603533,Roy,2011-07-17 13:20:00,13728,I hear your anticipation. Have a great trip Terry. Hope you don't get mechanical failure on your camera.
603534,Terry,2011-07-17 13:22:00,14456,"LOL...it could happen  someone told me up 144 was faster, but if I go on main roads it looked longer unless they were talking about that logging road that goes pass Saltan 667 or whatever it's called"
603535,Terry,2011-07-17 13:23:00,14456," 3 cameras, so one should survive"
603556,Dara,2011-07-17 15:12:00,3052,400 to 69 Sudbury and then west to Sault on 17. 17 north to Wawa from the Sault. You don't want to miss the drive along Lake superior from the Sault to Wawa. Bring your regular Walleye gear but make sure you have a bunch of yellow jigs with it. Say Hi in the way through the Sault if you get a chance.
603560,brw,2011-07-17 15:27:00,101," I have eaten at The Columbia a few times. Had a decent meal there each time. The place across the street from them (can remember the name) has always been very busy as well (never eaten there though). The Bristol motel is clean and the rooms are spacious.  Have been to Esnagi lake/Mar Mac lodge (fly in out of White River) and, assuming your lake is similar, I have had success on 1/4 oz jigs w/ a 3 in white Gulp twister tail tipped with half a crawler or a leech, or simply a bare jig tipped with either. one tip I can share is that I always have a separate rod rigged with a live bait rig--a long snell (anywhere from 2-4 ft) with one or 2 hooks. I place a few beads above the hook and one on your main line where you tie the snell on. A 1/4 or 3/8 oz walking sinker above your swivel completes the rig. I have found that when the walleye bite is finicky, they will often hit a live bait rig when they will not touch a jig. I think it's because the rig stays in the strike zone longer, particularly if the fish are suspended. If they are suspended, just slip on one or 2 ""floats"" (small, colored styrofoam piece with a hole bored in the middle--Gander or Cabela's sells them) to your rig and it will rise further in the water column.  Just find the outside of the weed edges (typically at 10 ft or so) and either should produce.  Enjoy your trip. For the 1st time in over 30 yrs, did not make it to God's country this year, and I'm going into serious withdrawl....!!!"
603561,Terry,2011-07-17 15:28:00,14456,Dara yellow...check  pretty sure just zooming by the Sault..but thanks       4eyes: thanks for the tips
603563,Terry,2011-07-17 15:33:00,14456,another question  On Fly-ins do you still fish or do you troll most of the time   I troll more then I still fish
603566,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-17 15:39:00,0,"for food in wawa i'd recommend the kinniwabi pines (on the side of highway 17 just outside wawa).  they have some real good good.  i also liked the restaurant at the wawa motor inn but it wasn't anything special.  not much there for tackle i don't think so come well supplied... jigs, cranks, spinner rigs etc.  i'm pretty jealous."
603567,Terry,2011-07-17 15:47:00,14456,thanks good info ..  I am pretty excited .......
603568,Gregoire,2011-07-17 15:55:00,1397,"I was just up wawa way last week. Kinniwabi pines was recommended as a place for a nice sit down meal. There is a place just after that before you go into wawa, by the gas station, something kitchen that is a dive, but has great burgers. The Canadian Tire in town, the clothing part on the side, has a selection of what looked like locally made worm harnesses. There is also a tackle store in town, right by the lake, across from the chinese restaurant. I didn't go in, but they may be able to give you some tips. The driving directions that you have already received sound right to me.  Have a great trip!"
603569,irishfield,2011-07-17 15:56:00,26272,Have fun my friend... catch some for me!
603571,northernboy,2011-07-17 15:58:00,13,"I live in Sudbury and used to work in Wawa.  I would take 144 to the Sultan Road, cut across the Sultan Rd to Chapleau and down 101.  Would make it from Sudbury to Wawa in usually less than 4 hours dpending on the condition of the road between the Watershed and Sultan"
603582,TJQ,2011-07-17 16:30:00,7806,have fun!!!
603587,Terry,2011-07-17 16:37:00,14456,"Thanks, you bet I will have fun  it's still 12 days away but can't fish so I am dreaming about the trip and getting things together I need  fishgreg, good info  northernboy, just how bad is the road, when I was on it last years ago , it truly was a logging road with washouts and lots of washboard type conditions"
603595,BillM,2011-07-17 17:03:00,17367,"Terry, which lake are you flying into with Parks?  I flew out with them with Solo a few years back and we had a awesome time.  The Sultan rd is about 77kms or so, and it won't be that bad this time of year.  It saves you about an hour or so on the overall trip..  Make sure you have a spare tire though.  I've taken it numerous times without issue."
603597,brw,2011-07-17 17:08:00,101," Terry: I will often troll to find fish, then throw out a marker and dunk w/ a jig or harness/bait rig over the same area. A great search bait for me is a Thin fin (made by Storm). I like it because it only dives to 3 ft or so and you can fish it in shallow waters w/ weeds and not get a lot of salad. I usually place a small split shot about 18 in above the lure to get me 1 more ft of depth if I need it. Silver w/ a blue tint, fire tiger, and perch work for me. Last yr on Esnagi (Aug) we had a stretch of 90 degree days and dead flat calm and our best success was trolling. They did not want a subtle approach like a jig.  That's the beauty of fishing: the fish will eventually tell you what they want!!! Good luck."
603598,Terry,2011-07-17 17:11:00,14456,great stuff guys   the name of the lake is Abbey
603599,BillM,2011-07-17 17:12:00,17367,"As far as baits all you'll need are some harnesses and big stick baits....  If the lake you are flying into has a decent population of walleye, you'll smash them on both.  It doesn't get much better then trolling after dark with big sticks baits!!!"
603601,Terry,2011-07-17 17:25:00,14456,"I have lots of harnesses and a flat of worms and plastics  and I do like stick baits when dark.......seems like the same things work everywhere up there  I was thinking of finding a folding minnow trap at a tackle store and try catching some minnows up there, I will not have leeches unless I get them on me swimming up there"
603603,BillM,2011-07-17 17:37:00,17367,"I've also used Berkley Gulp leeches on worm harnesses, they last at least 4-5 fish before they need to be replaced.  They'll work in a pinch if you run out of worms."
603612,misfish,2011-07-17 18:11:00,29133,"Terry I missed placed my ticket,can you get me another one.DANG.    Safe trip and have fun bud."
603624,Leecher,2011-07-17 18:47:00,7832," I've never been on a fly-in but the way I fish for walleye is as follows:  I use a 1/4oz jig with twister tail tip with live leech or worm in shallow waters and 1/2oz in deeper / current waters.  My preferred jig color is white, chartreuse for twister tail (the double twister is even better) Once on the fishing grounds, I like to drift and jig.... making bottom contact is key.... not into trolling much.  On windy days, use of a trolling motor is bonus to keep boat position and also to keep your vertical presentation on Q... A marker booey is good to have.... once you start catching them, throw it over board so not to loose the hot spot.  Another method I've used is anchored using a pickerel rig that you can purchase at CTC or Walmart.... I rig both hooks with live leeches.... trick is to keep contact with bottom.... any pickerel / fish in the vicinity will get them to strike.... lots of fun when you can hook into 2 at a time     Don't forget that those pickerel rigs require bell sinkers so you may want to purchase a small container if you don't have any.  Hope this helps and have a great time on your trip:) Jacques"
603631,BillM,2011-07-17 18:52:00,17367,"Terry, forgot to mention but for our flyin, we back trolled 99% of the time.  Best way to cover water unless you've found the motherload right below the boat."
