606473,MCTFisher9120,2011-07-26 21:29:00,3761,"Hello again OFC, hope the summer has been good for everybody so far. I just got back last night from my 9 week season at Kesagami Wilderness Lodge and it was a blast, hired as a 1st year Guide I spent 30 days guiding and the rest on shore doing dockhand work. It was so much fun to say the least, the people I met and the friends I have now are superior...Can't wait to get back as a Guide next season!  Here are pictures of guests I guided this summer, first well share these and some of the nice catches that we had along the way then onto some scenic and pictures of the friends and I  Boys with the Waschuck group haha lot's of fun these guys were.     And your's truly      Other guests I had during the summer.    41""   41""   43""   40""   42""   There were a few other 40"" + fish that I had guests catch this season and lot's of other big pike...once over 31 32 inches long these fish just get huge and fat, It was slow learning at first but once I got out more and more I learned new spots and started making better plans. Really looking forward to next year now that I can start off with lot's of confidence.    The Lodge     Staff fishing day was a blast and my first time guiding we caught a few walleye and a nice pike later in the day. Loved every second of it plus the 15 or more walleye they made me fillet haha...had to learn someway    Working in the boat, really fun to drive and do this haha    One of the bigger Pike I caught myself this summer, a healthy 37""   My PB 25"" Walleye  Shore lunch anybody? I miss shore lunch already    Black Bear at the lunch spot, had to cook with my buddy a few times this summer.    In the office chair    This was my first cast on Kesagami Lake, caught this beauty 34"" on a silver minnow    Hanging out with my friends around the fire      Picking apart a walleye    Bald Eagle up in a tree    Merganser's    Sunset    Golden Eagle, I saw 3 this summer      I had such a fun summer and it's only the start of it. I have some time in the city until this Saturday morning when I leave for 4 solid weeks of camping and fishing out in Leeds & The Thousand Islands again. Going to be such fun out there bassin every day.  Up to 3 setups now, possibly getting a 4th at the end of August     I treated myself to a new rod and reel and a little tackle. There is a picture at the bottom of the setup, it's a 7'3 St Croix Legend Tournament Big Jig rod, feels very nice paired with a 200E7 Curado  Well still lot's to do in terms of the family camping trip, I'll be on OFC then some days I hope but I need to start catching up on bass reports   Take Care everybody!

606749,JTorra,2011-07-27 15:57:00,50,"Guiding was the best ""job"" I ever had. What a life, huh? Glad you enjoyed it!  From your pics it seems that 40""plus fish were rare. Considering Kesagami's reputation I am surprised. Was it a function of the lake or the rookie guide?  Seriously though, I have been considering doing a Kesagami trip for a few years and may not now since I have already has some multiple 40"" fish days elsewhere. How many really big fish did you see or hear of at Kesagami, Mike?  Pics please from others, unless I am hi-jacking this thread..."
