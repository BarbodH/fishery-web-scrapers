I mainly Fish for Bass, Walleye, and Pike. And i mainly fish in the grand river near York.  Anywho I've been fishing the last couple days in York and can't seem to get anything. Never had any luck in the river in summer, Only spring..I had one jumping bass today that got off..   Does anyone have any suggestions ?"

Between the lack of rain and farmers irrigating it is lower than I remember seeing in many years -  and its really warm. Fishin will be tough eveywhere. I've only fished York a couple times, mostly got cat fish, small bass and the occiassional small sheepie . Keep looking and you will find where they're hidin.  "
