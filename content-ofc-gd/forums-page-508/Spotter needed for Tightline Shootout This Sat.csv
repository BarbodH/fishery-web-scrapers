There is a salmon tournament being held out of bluffers park This sat and you will need to be there to observer on another boat. Hours would be Friday night from 7-9 for meeting and then sat am from 530-3:00pm.  It is a great event and a chance to watch some of the top anglers on lake ontario for the day, great way to learn and have a free boat ride, there is some sweet boats and it is random draw.  Friday night is a fun night with a raffle and some great prizes.  Please call my cell phone if interested and all observers must have a fishing license.  Observers will get taken care of with a bag of loot from me or some gas money.  Please txt me or call me at 416 220-7451  Leave a message if I don't answer.  Thanks AL www.alsadventures.ca"
