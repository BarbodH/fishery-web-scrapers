553988,Uncle Buck,2011-02-21 15:12:00,1000,See with JEff at the Long Sault Motel... he should have one or be able to order one in for ya...
554044,wolfville,2011-02-21 18:20:00,396, I second that since you're so close to Long Sault. New Work Carp and Carp Kit International are also reputable online stores in Ontario if Jeff doesn't have what you want.
554049,mike rousseau,2011-02-21 18:32:00,4661,Thnx... I was looking at the chub vizor at new world carp but they are sold out and the same buy from carp kit int is like $100 bucks more...

554335,Victor,2011-02-22 13:47:00,1609,Musky Mike buying a Carp Bivvy?   I just had to say it haha.  Good luck with the search!
554352,wolfville,2011-02-22 14:55:00,396,"Getting it from UK is doable but bivvys are quite bulky so you'd be expecting to pay a lot for shipping.

Send a PM to Stephen in NWC and maybe he can let you know when he'll restock the items you're looking for or even special order for you, it has worked for me in the past."
