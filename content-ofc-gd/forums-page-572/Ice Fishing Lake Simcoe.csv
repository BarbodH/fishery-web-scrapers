How'd it go? Well, slow and crappy to say the least. We're never going back to that neck of the woods again, that's for sure ! My wife's uncle and his friends wanted to go (a bunch of guys that go fishing like 3 times a year) so it was an ""adventure"" for them, but the fishing stank. We booked an operator for them who was a nice guy, but didn't put us on the fish unfortunately. We had about 15 Perch for the day between myself and Afraz, and the other guys got skunked (mainly cuz they didn't know what they were doing). I felt bad that they didn't catch anything their first time out ice fishing, but this part of the lake was very slow that day (we talked to others on the ice, same story). On a positive note though, everyone had a good time being out at least. It was a good time regardless. At one point, we got checked by CO's, it's a good thing I stressed to my wife's uncle and his friends to make sure they printed e-licenses or it could've gotten ugly(er), lol! The day was so slow, I didn't feel like making a full video, but I did make a little short trailer for the trip, so hope you enjoy! Again, filmed on my trusty little iPhone 4. Thanks!
