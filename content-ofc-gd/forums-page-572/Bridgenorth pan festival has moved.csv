We had to cancel the event due to excessive wind. Ice Huts were blowing down the lake with wind gusts to 75km, this morning. Not a nice place to introduce new anglers to ice fishing. The OFAH opened up their new Heritage Center (beautiful facility) for the families that made the effort to join us. Hundreds of kids and their families took advantage of this generous offer and enjoyed a day learning about fishing and outdoors, inside out of the weather.  We tried spread the word as best as possible through the media but lots of people still made their way to the causeway, some even bravely ventured out on the ice for a little while. We worked to ensure that everyone who attended at both locations received a prize. Minister of Natural Resources, Hon. Linda Jeffrey dropped by to enjoy some time with the families at the Heritage Center and even came out to brave the elements on Chemong for a fish. No warm ride for her. She walked out to join the people on the ice.  With the hard work of all of the volunteers, we tried very hard to turn lemons into lemonade.  Thank You to everyone."

Considering the weather that is pretty amazing.  http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2987871  Thank you to everyone involved.
