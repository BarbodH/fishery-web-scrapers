554555,Dara,2011-02-23 03:50:00,3052,I finally got out fishing. It was a free weekend and I hadn't bought my license yet...do I get one or do I just stick with the Conservation limit.  Lemme tell you. It was cold. The weather forecast said -24 in the morning and a high of -15 with 15k winds.  Got up at 5 and it was -16. Not too bad. Left the trading post at 6:15 and headed north. When we left the truck it was -21 and windy. Got to the lake and for some reason I stopped at the spot we generally fish instead of looking for a sheltered spot....bad idea.  We had a hut but I can't fish specs from a hut. I need to be out watching my lines.      I was a bit concerned about slush what with last weeks reports but I had nothing to worry about. We had 2' of SOLID ice with just a dusting of snow on top to keep the sliders happy.  I picked up my first fish before the 2 guys I went with even had camp set up and a line down.  I hate getting a fish that fast because too many times it turns out to be the only one of the day.   Picked up my second a couple hours later.  Then Dwayne finally got one.    That was it...we called it a day at 3...just too cold and slow fishing to stay any longer.   My 2       They were full of perch minnows.   I'll be going back there in a few weeks to give it a warmer try.

What is it with that? a fast first fish then nada? Nice looking Splakes, yum.  That wind definitely firmed up the top here too, but the slush is there....waiting  Great report D  Thanks  Simon"
554627,Leecher,2011-02-23 13:57:00,7832,Nicely done Dara A couple of beauties for the pan Thanks for sharing Leechman
554644,johnnyb,2011-02-23 14:39:00,3413,LOL -- I was going to say that the tails didn't look perfectly square...   Nice fish...good on you for getting out.  Now get your license and get out some more!
554648,Rod Caster,2011-02-23 14:52:00,5784,"Nice speckled splake trout.  Full of perch minnows...I'd be jigging a perch chubby darter knowing that. Then again, I apparently can't catch trout through the ice if my life depended on it."
