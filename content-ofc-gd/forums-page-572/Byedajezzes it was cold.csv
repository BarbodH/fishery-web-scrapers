Awe no scence whining about it,as we had a good time fishn and talking.Always a good time with terry.Fishhunter joined up aswell. That guy can catch fish.Nice to meet you FH. Terry managed a nice white.Quick pic and released to fight another day.     Myself,I had one hit.The fish were there,but not liking what I had to offer I guess.  The winds died down,the sun was shining when it was time to leave.  Well looks like my next outing will be at the Tyler event.  Everything seems to have tighten up and lots of cars and trucks out there.Easy walking.  I,ll leave you with a short vid of the ride back.   <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvidmg.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fv731%2Fmisfish%2F20110221_02.mp4"">  FUN TIME OUT BUD,THANKS AGAIN."
554070,irishfield,2011-02-21 19:19:00,26272,LOL Brian.. you probably could have walked from the house to where Lloyd likes to fish !
554073,Terry,2011-02-21 19:33:00,14456,yeah we could almost see his house from where we fish...lol   great getting out with you again Brian
554103,misfish,2011-02-21 20:56:00,29133,  Now I know why you didnt take gas money.   J/K.   Always enjoy your company bud.
554108,Joey,2011-02-21 21:11:00,9122,"Glad you got out B.  Now if Terry had told you where it was, you wouldn't have had that lovely sled ride  Looks like it was a great day with friends.  I slept in"
554131,Leecher,2011-02-21 21:30:00,7832,"Great report, pic and video Brian But would you mind explaining this word for me ""Byedajezzes"" Sounds like fun... especially the ride back Thanks for sharing Jacques"
554138,misfish,2011-02-21 21:43:00,29133," if I had caught a fish,you be asking alot more my friend."
554140,fishnsled,2011-02-21 21:44:00,3520,"Love the video Brian!  Looks like you enjoyed the ride. Nice fish Terry. Looks like there is a bit more snow out there today, could use a couple of inches to smooth things out though.  I slept in today as well Joey and been fighting a headache all day trying to keep it from becoming a migraine. I think I've got it almost beat. Got some beef broth going for some beef barley soup and some beef brisket marinading for some jerky for the boys next weekend. I think the smells are helping my head."
554142,Leecher,2011-02-21 21:51:00,7832, That thought crossed my mind B Good luck next time around
554143,misfish,2011-02-21 21:52:00,29133,"Got to ride the drifts to cool the sliders down. We did hit a twist yer back spot,but the man held yer steady."
554146,Joey,2011-02-21 21:53:00,9122," Weird, that was my major reason for sleeping in, headache, which I still have.  Wonder if it is the heater in the hut?  Haven't made jerky in awhile, don't think the boys will complain if I make some and take it on our trip, thanks for the idea"
554154,fishnsled,2011-02-21 22:06:00,3520," Maybe the heater in the hut. I do keep the vents open as well as the top of the doors a bit. I was thinking it was dehydration the last time it happen. Yesterday I drank lots of water so who knows. Maybe just the front coming in, weather will bring on my migraines.  I'm sure that your jerky will be very similar to mine. After all, it is you recipe."

554171,misfish,2011-02-21 22:55:00,29133,"If the temps hold like they say,I,ll be driving out to that der spot saturday.Just have to register my youngest son and his friend at IBP first.  I want jerk too."
554177,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-02-21 23:19:00,1362," I think it's similar to the slang of the Gatineau Valley sayin ""mo-dzee-tabernack"" Jacques"
554179,muskymatt,2011-02-21 23:22:00,2608,"  I hear ya....I snuck out for a couple of hours this afternoon and holy crap.....did I mention I hate wind???.....the wind was howling across the lake, I even had my truck trying to block the wind, but no go. Even the Buddy cranked to high was barely enough to keep the ice off the lines, didn't help that there was no snow to pack her in. Managed 2 perch....  Still a great afternoon on the ice....did I mention I hate wind?"
554182,Bernie,2011-02-21 23:33:00,3190,"Nice post Brian. Looks like fun!  Joey and Will, perhaps a CO detector would be a good idea? Not sure how well they would work in a shack, but it beats getting a headache."
554364,Leecher,2011-02-22 15:31:00,7832, that's close enough Steve
