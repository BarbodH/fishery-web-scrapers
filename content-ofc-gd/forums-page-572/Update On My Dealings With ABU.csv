554400,solopaddler,2011-02-22 20:55:00,8605,"For those that may be interested, I was contacted by Pure Fishing in Brantford today and they are replacing my defective Revo Toro free of charge.  Was it good karma? The power of the internet? Who knows? I'm not going to speculate as to why this offer was extended out of the blue. I am however very happy and thankful.  A big thumbs up to ABU!"
554402,esoxansteel,2011-02-22 21:50:00,1307,"Glad everything worked out for you Mike, to bad all reels were not as simple and dependable as a centrepin"
554409,trapshooter,2011-02-22 23:23:00,1234,Nice.  Be interesting to see if the new one lasts.
554410,mercman,2011-02-22 23:34:00,7054,  Hummm Me thinks there be a few words missing here Glad it all worked out for you
554412,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-23 00:03:00,4399,Good to hear Mike!
554425,aplumma,2011-02-23 00:23:00,6896,Good deal Mike it restores my faith in Abu.  Art
554436,solopaddler,2011-02-23 00:30:00,8605," Agreed Ben. I'll definitely be putting it through it's paces this year so time will tell.    Yeah well, I figured I'd take the high road on this one. I'm getting tired of the bickering and locked threads.    That's exactly what I said to the ABU rep Art, totally agree."
554440,Billy Bob,2011-02-23 00:36:00,5865,"So you're saying that Abu is the ""REEL DEAL""..."
554475,Rizzo,2011-02-23 01:23:00,4754," ....ouch, sorry BB gotta nominate that one for worst pun ever"
554482,vinnimon,2011-02-23 01:35:00,2593,Glad to hear everything worked out for you Mike
554537,BillM,2011-02-23 03:04:00,17367,Mike there is a Calais for sale in the classifieds if this thing breaks again
554538,Billy Bob,2011-02-23 03:06:00,5865, Can't be since you haven't heard all my other ones....  :rofl2:
554539,cram,2011-02-23 03:09:00,1733,"Like i said, they replaced mine with one phone call -- no problemo.  You might have just caught someone having a bad day the first time around."
554544,solopaddler,2011-02-23 03:16:00,8605,"  I don't need another reel, I have too many as it is."
554551,Cudz,2011-02-23 03:35:00,2652,I have 5 abu reels. I am glad they stand behind them.  I would buy another now for sure. I wish I had the same result with the daiwa rod I broke about 3 years ago.  I have since bought about 7 reels and rods and none of them have been daiwa because I got screwed over on a broken rod.
554633,Leecher,2011-02-23 14:10:00,7832,"Glad to hear that they are going to replace it for free Mike Got to love it when that happens  I've only dealt with Pure Fishing once and was completely satisfied with their customer service     Mind you, it wasn't a reel but their Gulp bucket"
