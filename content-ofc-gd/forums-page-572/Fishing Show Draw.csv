I thought the seminars were AWESOME, however, i thought the sales were less than impressive. in fact, most vendors seemed to have jacked their prices for the show which annoys me (I love the buy 3 rapalas deals for $25 - no claks or x-raps either); Radioworld was selling the Navionics HotMaps for Canada for $110 plus tax, not a bad deal. All in all I was a little less than impressed, but again, seminars made up for a lot."

Use to be you would get a deal if you went to the show because the other stores jacked the price and had no local competition. Now with the internet and Basspro they have to complete all year round or you go somewhere else.  It was a nice day out,. Good too see new products and equipment."
