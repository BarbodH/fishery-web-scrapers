If I can only share one tip to everyone, it would be downsize everything! 2LB test, UL rod, sensitive spring bobber indicator and very small jig hooks.    Fished family day weekend, a huge muskie came interrupt my pan fish action. Caught the beast on my video camera, the fish looked HUGE down the hole, especially when I was fishing 6' FOW. "
