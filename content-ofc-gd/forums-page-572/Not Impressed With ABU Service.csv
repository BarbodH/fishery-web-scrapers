553980,solopaddler,2011-02-21 14:56:00,8605, It was purchased from BPS online.
554004,Cudz,2011-02-21 16:05:00,2652,Jaydub bought a reel from bps online and had the exact same problem with his and he took it back to bps in vaughn and they exchanged it without question
554080,thesarge,2011-02-21 19:58:00,1,"So just to clarify...  1. You talked to a bunch of different folks and - low and behold - Abu (the company that made your reel) was the only one to reply? Sounds reasonable so far.  2. They recommended someone to take it to... still good... we're unsure if you bothered to phone that company in Orillia to inquire as to how the process actually works with Abu products brought in for repair... still on the right track?  3. Your friend is now in on it, badgering a poor Rep for some odd reason. Not sure if he was in Malaysia turning screws on your particular reel but alas, he may be the one to blame.  And 4. You haven't seemed to bother trying to bring it back to where you bought it... a big box company that is typically worth their weight in salt when it comes to returning stuff...  Good luck I guess... try Shimano next time maybe?"
554081,mercman,2011-02-21 20:01:00,7054,OH............THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
554082,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-02-21 20:03:00,1362,Great minds think alike....
554084,Spiel,2011-02-21 20:04:00,9065,Not today.
553688,solopaddler,2011-02-20 18:31:00,8605,"Last July I made a post asking if anyone knew of any rep's I could deal with directly.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=45609&st=0&p=487690&hl=ABU%20Garcia&fromsearch=1entry487690  The line guide on my Revo Toro stopped functioning the second day of its use on a fly in trip no less.  Anyhow I just started inquiring about it a month ago since I'd been busy 'till then and have the time now.  I contacted a couple of different people that were recommended to me on my thread, plus ABU directly.  The only response I received was from ABU. They're not going to do anything for me. They expressed their concern that I have a problem with my reel, but they won't do anything directly to help, and suggested I take the reel to some place in Orillia.  Fantastic service, gotta love it."
553690,Leecher,2011-02-20 18:36:00,7832,That really sucks Mike... sorry to hear
553692,mercman,2011-02-20 18:54:00,7054,"Legally, if the reel is less than a year old, they either have to replace it or repair it free of charge.If it means sending it to Orillia, then thats what you have to do. Its a pain in the keister for sure, but cheaper than replaceing it yourself."
553693,Roy,2011-02-20 19:00:00,13728,"Get used to it, Mike. It's owned by pure fishing now."
553695,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-20 19:06:00,4399,"That`s shameful,I bought a Revo last year so far so good!"
553698,Leecher,2011-02-20 19:11:00,7832,"Mike, you can always send them an email saying that you are part of a fishing forum and that you have inquired / posted a question about the members experience with the aforementioned reel and see what they respond.  May work in your favor / may not, but just thought I mention it"
553717,solopaddler,2011-02-20 20:16:00,8605,"What's ultimately going to happen because I have no other options, I'll bring the reel to Aikmens and pay to have them fix it. (They won't fix it for free I asked).  Huge pain for me 'cause A.I don't have the time and B. I despise dealing with Aikmens  Oh well, live and learn."
553735,OhioFisherman,2011-02-20 21:24:00,6623,"I think it kind of sad, as a kid Abu reels were considered the best out there, I don`t personally know any one that buys them now. I haven`t bought a new Abu reel since the 80`s."
553747,perchslayer666,2011-02-20 22:03:00,280,Should have bought a Zebco.
553795,Gregoire,2011-02-20 23:24:00,1397,"I own quite a few abu reels and have found the customer service to be very good. Have you tried calling pure fishing? I think I gave you this contact info before but I have included the phone number this time. I hope this helps: Jordan Schwantz Customer Service Representative Pure Fishing Canada 131 Savannah Oaks Drive, Unit # 1 Brantford, ON N3V 1E8  (519) 750 - 0100 ext 1011 Fax   750 - 0492  [emailÂ protected]"
553816,solopaddler,2011-02-20 23:58:00,8605,  Yeah I talked to them directly in Brantford. They referred me to the place in Orillia.
553817,irishfield,2011-02-21 00:13:00,26272,Rocky is good in Orillia Mike... did my line guide pawl and a 25 year cleaning/lube on my Mag III for about $13 !
553840,irishfield,2011-02-21 00:41:00,26272,LOL Mike.. amazing what people remember when they're slighted !
553862,cram,2011-02-21 01:28:00,1733,"Isn't Aikman's an abu repair shop?  My revo toro was broken and they sent me there.  For the record, my toro broke on the 2nd or 3rd trip and they replaced it.  Quite happy with the service."
553880,solopaddler,2011-02-21 02:07:00,8605, What broke on yours? It was the line guide on mine.    Didn't bother me in the slightest Art. If you can dish it out you can take it too.
553894,cram,2011-02-21 02:59:00,1733," Not sure what to call it, but the spool disconnected from the axle that went through it.  Apparently a common problem with that reel (the guy from aikman's said he saw a bunch).  Called Abu and they ordered a fix and then ended up replacing it."
553912,Cudz,2011-02-21 05:30:00,2652,Not a fan of Aikmens at all. My sister lives next door to the guy in charge of Pure fishing in Canada but he lives in Portage La Prairie MB so it is not the same guy you are dealing with.  I can get his number if you want.  Pure fishing used to be based in Portage but have since moved but he still lives there.
553930,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-02-21 12:53:00,1362,"Mike,  I had an issue with my 3 year old C3 6500 reel last year and went through the crap you're facing with Pure Fishing tech support here in Canada....  I decided to try the US location and it was like dealing with another totally different company   ...I dealt directly with the support person who does the reel repairs and after discussing my frustration with how my ""reel"" blew apart, she gave me an RMA# and told me to send it back for repair at ""no charge""....she ended up sending me a new reel!!  It's worth the try....here's the info:  Pure Fishing USA 1900 18th Street Spirit Lake, IA 51360  Phone: Tel: 1.800.228.4272"
553935,solopaddler,2011-02-21 13:08:00,8605, Thanks for the offer bud. I'll shoot you a pm if it comes to that.    Now that's a great idea! Should have thought of it myself.   At the moment I have a friend badgering an ABU rep he knows to help me out. If this doesn't pan out I'll start following these other leads.  Pretty dissapointed to hear so many others are having problems with this reel though. I thought maybe it was just me.
553939,Rizzo,2011-02-21 13:15:00,4754,reel repair...interesting. When the line guide on my 6500 busticated I took it as a reason to go buy a new reel of a different make!
553943,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-02-21 13:22:00,1362, My problem was a little different....The spot weld where the body of the reel welds to the base of the reel broke off as I was grabbing my rod out of the Salty rod holder to land a Muskie....user induced???---> possibly but they replaced it for free
553946,Billy Bob,2011-02-21 13:23:00,5865," I also had great service when I contact Pure Fishing in Spirt Lake, IA by phone...they told me to send it in even though I didn't have the receipt any longer...the roller guide on a spinning reel was pinching the cutting my light 4 and 6# test line....Pure Fishing sent me a brand new reel and it was at my door within 10 days of me sending them my defective one. You know what I think I have the letter I enclosed and who I dealt with on my computer....I'll check and post here if I do have it.  Bob"
553947,solopaddler,2011-02-21 13:29:00,8605," I tend to agree, but when you're talking about an almost $300 reel that breaks the 2nd day you use it I want it replaced or fixed at no charge.    My scenario is a lot different than, say for example, someone who busts the plastic lip off a $6 lure bouncing it off rocks then whines about not getting any satisfaction from the company.  In that case I'd probably tell that person to suck it up, quit your whining, and buy another lure.  Just saying..."
553949,Spiel,2011-02-21 13:38:00,9065,"Bring it over here Mike, I'll fix it for you.  "
553962,lew,2011-02-21 14:13:00,12766,"Just curious Mike, but did you take it back to wherever you bought it for either a replacement or refund ??"
