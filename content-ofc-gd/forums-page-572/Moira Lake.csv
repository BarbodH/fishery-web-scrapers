554223,Banger68,2011-02-22 01:18:00,157,Nobody fishing this lake?  Not looking for your hot spots. Just a general idea for the quality of fishing in the lake.
554269,perchslayer666,2011-02-22 03:09:00,280,Not good. Stay far away.
554271,Banger68,2011-02-22 03:17:00,157, Too late ... booked already  Gather your on the lake.
