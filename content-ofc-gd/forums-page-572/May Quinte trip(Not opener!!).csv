554203,Grimace,2011-02-22 00:36:00,2020,"  Wayne buddy.  If I could tell you with any certainty I would jump on this.  I will not know until closer to the date.  I wouldn't want to be the guy that backs out on you last minute.  If you do not find anyone (which I hope you do) and it is closer to the date if I can swing it I will.  For the rest of you.  If you can swing it, do it.  I have had the pleasure of Wayne's company for last year's Walleye World and he is a solid dude.  I did not get to fish with Wayne as I fished from my boat but he had excellent results targeting shallow fish (they caught some real hogs).  In the evenings we watched some hockey and the lads were all class, a good bunch.  I would jump on this in a minute."
