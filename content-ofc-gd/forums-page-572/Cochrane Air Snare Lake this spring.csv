Told them we wanted to focus on good pike with enough walleye to eat, and per there availability we ended up with Snare Lake for June 4th for 5 days this spring. I'm sure we are in for some decent fishing but I was wondering if anyone has had experience with this lake, or the air service and their lakes in general. Any advice would be great!  Cheers, Andrew"
554165,Moosebunk,2011-02-21 22:40:00,3970,  PM me a list of any specific questions.  I've fished it (and stayed 6 days) along with the two connecting lakes Magiskan and Bateman.
