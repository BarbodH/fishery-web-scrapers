553503,danbouck,2011-02-20 01:49:00,4380, $475 plus tax
553504,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-20 01:53:00,1107,Can you camp there or just for the day I have seen people BBQin there before
553505,danbouck,2011-02-20 01:57:00,4380," I see people with tent trailers there, I don't think anyone would even care. Bayview marina in Port Rowan is $500 I believe and there is plenty of room for a camper there.  I have to speak with Old Cut in the next couple of weeks so I'll find out for ya."
