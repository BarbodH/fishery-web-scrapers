554371,Rattletrap2,2011-02-22 16:03:00,1652,"Thanks again for the tickets TJ (and also Gerritt!).  They didn't have the info from you at the will call booth on Saturday, but there was no issue with giving me the tickets. My Wife and I went and met our Daughter and Son in Law too.  I enjoyed the show. I didn't see any great deals, but it was a nice way to spend the day anyways. The expanded area was sorta a flea market of ShamWow type stuff. Hopefully next year they can fill that section as well. The dog training was neat though and a nice addition."
