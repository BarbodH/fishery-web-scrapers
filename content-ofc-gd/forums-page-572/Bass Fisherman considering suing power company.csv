554471,Billy Bob,2011-02-23 01:18:00,5865,This bass fishermen says the power company is responsible for his boat damage and it considering suing them.....what do you think ? http://www.wset.com/Global/story.asp?S=14072624
554474,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-23 01:21:00,0,this is somewhat akin to those goofs running their snowmobiles into a well marked hut and blaming the hut owners...  good luck buddy...
554476,aplumma,2011-02-23 01:24:00,6896,smmunnnnk....hehehehhee...sssss.... HA HA HA HA HA HA not a chance you hit it you pay for it. I would counter sue someone if they tried for that lawsuit.   Art
554477,irishfield,2011-02-23 01:25:00,26272,Insurance is mandatory for a tourney angler NO? $50k Triton and no hull insurance....
554508,Mahumba,2011-02-23 02:19:00,28,I just read the article and I hiccuped and spilled hot coffee on my lap right near my buster the clown that wears the German Helmet. I want to sue him for damages now!  Roger

554557,NBR,2011-02-23 03:56:00,163, I feel sorry for his loss but why wouldn't he file an insurance claim? My crystal ball sees a body of water closed to boats in the future.
554611,OhioFisherman,2011-02-23 13:28:00,6623,"A buddy fished a spring tournament at Kentucky lake in his newer 40k Triton, hit two logs. Broke the transom, turned the lower unit on his 225 merc. Insurance covered it, dude what are you doing trying to run around a lake after the winter melt at 70-80 miles an hour?  Most of us didn`t do much more than laugh at him, lucky you didn`t kill your stupid self?"
554635,craigdritchie,2011-02-23 14:13:00,1586,"I hate idiots like this guy, because they drive up the cost of everything. Instead of taking responsibility for his own problem, he tries to cast blame on someone else - in this case a power company. I would bet my last dollar that everyone who lives in that area pays more money for hydro than they actually need to - partly because the power company has to pay extra insurance costs to protect itself against nuisance lawsuits like this one.  Or, as NBR suggests, they just ban boat access altogether to reduce their exposure to nonsense like this.  I hope the judge not only throws this case out of court, but forces this jackass to pay the power company's legal costs as well."
554638,Roy,2011-02-23 14:18:00,13728,"Craig, we're not eyeballin' but we're communicatin'."
554640,Harrison,2011-02-23 14:20:00,2202,"Maybe he is just a savvy marketer trying to get more exposure for his sponsors logos... I dunno....doesn't make any logical sense.  Now if he nailed one of the unmarked sections of the ""train tracks"" on Rice, then yes, maybe he'd have something to pursue.  Brutal."
554684,jedimaster,2011-02-23 16:04:00,3472,"He hit a log? i thought he hit an unmarked power something or other? a Log? cmon dude, pull up your pants and call the insurance company, part your boat out, and suck it up. Now if the log was from someone dock and he knew what dock it was from...then you got something..."
554703,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-23 16:43:00,4399,"It makes perfect sense suing is a way of life in the good ole U.S of A.  Didn`t someone sue McDonalds for serving hot coffee?  The guy does sound like a dope though, anybody that runs a boat knows or should know you have to be very careful in the spring as those crazy ice fisherman leave all kinds of crap on the ice!"
554732,Whopper,2011-02-23 18:37:00,2174,"Just curious Phil, who should I have sent the bill for a new prop?, the bad part about it I knew they were there. I chalked it up to my own stupidy  So I guess Canadians don't sue anyone for any thing eh ?  Just for the record I think this guy or his insurance company is fishing. Nobody in their right mine would have a boat like that that didn't had insurance to cover such, unless they could afford to right it off."
554735,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-23 18:47:00,4399,  We don`t sue we are to polite and if we do we sue we say please and thank you!!!
554737,Fish4Eyes,2011-02-23 18:52:00,1022," We do sometimes, but it takes too damn long to get the money"
554740,pics,2011-02-23 18:59:00,1268,"Whenever I watch a Buffalo TV station, half the ads are for lawyers ""get what you deserve"" !!! I never see that on a Canadian channel....."
554741,Harrison,2011-02-23 19:02:00,2202," I found them the hard way too back when I was a teenager, so your not alone.  I do know one gentleman you hit them with his bass boat.  He did sue.. but the details I am not sure of.  I shake my head and wonder why they are not more clearly marked since they are man made.  Sorry to change the subject of the thread."
554748,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-23 19:15:00,835,"Insurance should not cover stupid but it usually does.  If that was in Ontario I would think there would be charges, maybe failure to keep a lookout or reckless.  You are suposed to know where you are, so if he hit the tracks on Rice he's got nothing."
554752,Harrison,2011-02-23 19:23:00,2202," Agreed 100%, but to be honest, I know Rice very well.  And I still do not know exactly where all the pilings are.  And if you are new or fairly new on the water, forget it.  You'd have no idea you can smack a concrete piler in the middle of the lake.  Even though there are channel markers, you can easily miss them."
