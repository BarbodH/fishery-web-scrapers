554025,Rod Caster,2011-02-21 17:32:00,5784,"Hey all,  Jim Jigger and I decided to try a new to us lake, near North Bay on Sunday. From what I know, this lake holds BIG walleye. The plan was simple... find access to the lake, walk out and drill a billion holes until we find structure or fish. Turns out the plans was a  bit of bust since we found nothing but 12feet of water. All we got were a few perch, one near 10inches.  3:00 arrives and my dad calls ""you wanna snowmobile to the shack?"" Since I opted out of driving to shack due to potentially bad ice conditions, and this ""new"" lake was a bust...I packed everything and headed to the landing on Nipissing. From the moment we dropped the lines, the perch were furious. Within an hour the walleye moved in. I caught three keepers, let go one tiny cigar, let go one in the slot and missed a BIG MOTHA at the hole. In total I have 25 perch to clean and three Walleye...pretty good for 2 hours of fishing.... the ice shack never fails.        Enjoy,  RC"
