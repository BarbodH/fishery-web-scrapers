554095,thebigcatch,2011-02-21 20:39:00,138,Just got some in the mail today     Www.custombasstackle.com
554295,OhioFisherman,2011-02-22 09:14:00,6623,Dang! you even get custom prices!
554298,Handlebarz,2011-02-22 10:23:00,3790,They have some very nice colors I could see doing well for other fish. Nice site they have there.
554372,bucktail,2011-02-22 16:03:00,1857,"I have just started custom painting cranks over the last few weeks , maybe in a while Ill share it with you guys. Spent years using my airbrush and decided to use it for good not evil, problem I have is the finish gel coat and sources and the consistancy of it for the air brush."
554377,thebigcatch,2011-02-22 16:11:00,138,Would love to see what you have been doing with them...... custom tackle is the best!
554384,bigugli,2011-02-22 16:34:00,6138,A lot of us love making our own stuff. Twice the satisfaction when something you crafted catches fish.
554386,Leecher,2011-02-22 16:37:00,7832, I agree 150% with what you said Bruce
554390,thebigcatch,2011-02-22 17:00:00,138,I don't make tackle but I do appreciate the time and effort that people put in to it
554583,singingdog,2011-02-23 11:54:00,1047,"Nice colors, but.....$10 for a bucktail jig?!? I am definitely in the wrong business."
554590,thebigcatch,2011-02-23 12:11:00,138,I got the jig (in the pic) for $4.50... That's a good $...but yeah custom tackle can get expensive tho  (but nice)
554593,Roy,2011-02-23 12:23:00,13728,I know lotsa folks who make tackle. Some are crazy nice...don't want to even wet them.....works of art they are.
554605,OhioFisherman,2011-02-23 13:13:00,6623,"Most lures are designed to catch fishermen, some may catch fish?"
