554130,fishnsled,2011-02-21 21:29:00,3520,  I'll practice with you anytime you want Brian. Too bad you couldn't make it yesterday but nice to see you were out today.
553831,Joey,2011-02-21 00:37:00,9122,"We went, we fished, we caught  The travel was okay, mostly rough ice and as was said in another thread, scratchers would have been good.  We were going to pick some up yesterday at Royal Distributing, but highway 400 and 11 were both closed, and it was not open when we drove by at 7:30 this morning, so we had to go without.  Sure ran the sliders hot that's for sure.  Lloyd travelled the ice all over and did quite well (so he says   )  No pics as he did not get one near us  In our crew, I got first fish, a nice laker, and an upgrade for Team 5 - 28.5 inches    Terry got second, a beauty whitefish     We had the pleasure of Will (Fishnsled) joining us today on our weekly outting, great to have you along Will, and congrats on your beauty laker     We moved once more and had lots of follows, but no takers.   Saw some great musky bait      Fished 9 hours today and I'm pooped so that's it for the report.  Joey"

553937,Spiel,2011-02-21 13:08:00,9065,Good stuff gang.  How's that new hut treating you Joey?
553956,Billy Bob,2011-02-21 13:54:00,5865," Oh, I thought he was cat fishing...."
553959,Leecher,2011-02-21 14:04:00,7832,Great report and pics Joey Sounds like fun was had by all.... nice laker Thanks for sharing Leechman
553960,NAW,2011-02-21 14:06:00,4022,"Good job to all!  You did better then we did.  Rolled a few, but nothing on the ice."
553961,Fisherman,2011-02-21 14:09:00,7201,"Nice catch, that pink dog, that's too much.  One of these days I'll run into you guys out there."
554013,Joey,2011-02-21 16:49:00,9122," New hut is great. If the sun is out, no need for a heater, and if it is not, I still can only put the heat on low, and sometimes have to turn it off it gets so hot in there.  Loving it  Thanks hon"
554037,icefisherman,2011-02-21 18:01:00,952,"Niow Joey,  I am yet to see one report of yours that doesn't have at least one super great picture...  Not sure about whities fishing but if you concentrate on the photo thing you might surprise pleasantly yourself  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
554038,splashhopper,2011-02-21 18:02:00,2931,great pics as usual Joey... thanks
554040,Roy,2011-02-21 18:05:00,13728,A great day for you guys for sure. Glad the weather cooperated more than Saturday. Couldn't you get a pic of Paul with a fish?
554046,TJQ,2011-02-21 18:23:00,7806,"Great Report Joey, thanks a ton hun!! Nice doggy doo!!"
554060,Terry,2011-02-21 19:09:00,14456, only when he is eating one of Joeys fish.....LOL  just kidding
554062,Jewelbee,2011-02-21 19:13:00,422, OMG!!!!!!!LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
554077,Spiel,2011-02-21 19:55:00,9065," I don't care who you are, that's funny!"
554094,fishnsled,2011-02-21 20:37:00,3520,"Thanks for posting up the report Joey. It was nice to hang out for the day and catch up, great to see everyone. Slow bite but marked lots of fish tight to bottom. Thanks to the tip on the lakers.  I wasn't marking them like you were. Lots of fun watching the bait on the screen and fishing coming in for the attack. Hopefully we'll do it again before the season is over.  I also like to thank our good luck charm Paul. It wasn't 10 seconds after he told me I was up next when the fish was on. I believe that Paul doesn't need to catch any fish as he gets so much enjoyment out of watching others do it for him, heck of a great guy.  Good times, a few fish caught, great company. Pretty much a perfect day on the ice."
554098,misfish,2011-02-21 20:49:00,29133,"Sry J, missed this one. Nice pics and report. We were there today aswell. Terry showed me up,but Im out of practice.  TFS"
554129,Joey,2011-02-21 21:28:00,9122,"LOL guys, thanks for the laughs (and Paul is laughing too)  Yep, Cheerleader Paul"
