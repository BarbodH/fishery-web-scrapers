553716,Beans,2011-02-20 20:00:00,3339,  Probably not too good for the 'skeeters either...  
553779,douG,2011-02-20 22:53:00,2693,"Should it be aloud?  I think it should be vewwy vewwy quiet.  How you doin', Chris?"
553919,ChrisK,2011-02-21 09:57:00,2772,"Couldn't be better Doug Now if only we could figure out a way to stop polluting Lake Simcoe and all the surrounding waters in Ontario and on a grander scale, the world. Any ideas Doug cause I think the banning of cars on the ice has pretty much been ruled out here...."
553942,Spiel,2011-02-21 13:17:00,9065,"Ahhhh....wrong Chris, Chris.  Yes, vewwy, vewwwy quietly, don't want to upset the locals.  Doing okay here too Doug, thanks for asking. You?"
553954,ChrisK,2011-02-21 13:47:00,2772,No...your Spiel and I'm Chris 
554149,fishermccann,2011-02-21 21:56:00,655,Put a ban on 2 strokes would be a start!
554168,Moosebunk,2011-02-21 22:44:00,3970,If ya couldn't park on the ice there'd be even more vehicles left idling in the streets around Simcoe's shoreline... and more townspeople lobbying to put up signage.
554172,Bernie,2011-02-21 23:00:00,3190," Did you know that some/most 2 stroke outboards made today have less emissions than 4 strokes?  Anyhow, keeping with the thread.  Walking down the street it isn't uncommon to see oil slicks, fuel leaks and coolant/antifreeze puddles. But if the same thing happens in a service garage over time, they make you clean up the contamination. I wonder how much contamination is under those streets?  I don't think it really matters where you park, it will eventually end up in the water system anyway. Don't get me wrong, I don't like it either.  If we all rode horses how much crap would end up in the creeks?"
554173,Terry,2011-02-21 23:06:00,14456," well if we have to ride horses, I glad it's you that has to tighten up the nuts and not me......LOL"
554174,irishfield,2011-02-21 23:07:00,26272,
554175,Bernie,2011-02-21 23:09:00,3190, LOL. Both of my grandfathers were blacksmiths. I'm glad that someone invented the infernal(sic) combustion engine.
554181,misfish,2011-02-21 23:24:00,29133," You sir,can buy my next motor then."
553279,trophypikehunter,2011-02-19 11:34:00,89,"The boys and I were chatting at the water cooler and they were asking me what I thought about Ice Parking and I said it should not be aloud, If I was to gather a crowd of people down by the water and then dump a barrel of motor oil in the Lake I would imagine these people would be angry and it could be tough getting out of there!(I live in Keswick) with all the vehicles on the ice I would think that a percentage will leak oil and other fluids on the ice but this is okay?  if we did ban vehicles on the ice this could improve the Lake and the fishing.."
553285,ChrisK,2011-02-19 12:01:00,2772,"I'm sure this thread will open up a can of worms but I can't resisit. I'll take the first poke at it. So does that mean that all motorized vehicles would be banned from the ice like snowmobiles,Atv's, modified snow machines,ice augers,generators and or anything that runs on gas using oil additives ??? Just wondering"
553286,bigugli,2011-02-19 12:05:00,6138,Don't forget all those gas and oil spitting boat motors. There are thousands of leaky motors plying those waters in the warmer month. just check out the oil slicks around the marinas.
553287,Terry,2011-02-19 12:05:00,14456," agreed how can you stop everything that has oil in it from being on the lake and the native people on islands would be pissed and ice water, is there a difference? so no oil on the water too..no outboard motors airplanes can't land on water no more shipping lanes.......fire boat is going to take a long time to get to a cottage on an island when they have to paddle their fire boat there"
553300,skeeter,2011-02-19 12:49:00,1907,No more off shore drilling for oil either!  No more Swamp People shows?
553422,ChrisK,2011-02-19 19:46:00,2772,I know I had this thread locked but did some thinking and I'm interested were this is going to go so have at her folks !!
553425,mercman,2011-02-19 19:57:00,7054,"I know there are lots of idiots out there who would not think twice about leaving crap all over the ice, but i like to believe that anyone who loves fishing enough to invest the 1000's of dollars necessary to pursue the sport, would take the time to leave as little traces as possible behind  them in the environment. Where parking is part of guided ice fishing or organized events, the organisers should be responsible for any cleanups required due to leakage of any kind. As far as outboards, i think most of us keep our machines finely tuned enough, and would try and clean up any spils as much as possible. But then again......maybe i'm just naive"
553426,Spiel,2011-02-19 20:03:00,9065,I think it should be as quiet as possible.
553430,Sinker,2011-02-19 20:24:00,8692,"Ya, lets ban everyone from going on the ice. Province wide. That should save some lives and reduce toxins entering the water. All we need now is enough manpower to enforce it..........  ........no prob!!!  S."
553435,Oggie,2011-02-19 20:45:00,588,I understand your concern but parking is a huge issue around Simcoe. Driving out to park on the ice is kind of a must in some areas. The municipality (residents) has forced the issue with no parking signs. How would we access the lake if we couldn't park on it?  Dan O.
553451,brifishrgy,2011-02-19 21:29:00,559,"parking on the ice doest do any harm, if the leaky cars parked on the roadways beside the lake it would carry the same oil into the water when the snow thawed"
553460,Skud,2011-02-19 22:56:00,739, I agree if cars were parked hundreds of yards away from the lake the water run off from rain and melting snow flushes all the crap into the lake anyway.  But BOTH actions DO HARM the lake.
553467,mercman,2011-02-19 23:18:00,7054,"Its up to us. I mean if you have a leaky car, you KNOW you have a leaky car. Up to you to choose not to park on the ice.Even on land near water, the RESPONSIBLE thing to do is drop cardboard under your vehicule, and take it with you for disposal when you leave. Makes sense...no"
553468,Tybo,2011-02-19 23:22:00,1373,The millions of tonnes of salt that get wash in to the lakes is more of a concern.
553469,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-19 23:25:00,0,i'm definitely thinking that runoff from the keswick and other towns on simcoe would be more detrimental to the lake than the cars that park on it...
553538,Afraz,2011-02-20 03:27:00,250,"Lets just ban human beings from Earth that way we can't pollute anything directly or indirectly...  Given that i am an Alien i should be allowed to fish anywhere i please.. LMAO !!!  Banning parking on the ice lmao..  There are bigger things to worry about.. Like the salt issue, and runoff during the thaw..."
553559,BillM,2011-02-20 04:27:00,17367,"Better ban everything on the lake.  ATV's, snowmobiles, boats, anything with a motor."
553561,irishfield,2011-02-20 04:31:00,26272,"Why I always get a good chuckle out of the Lake Association going on about water quality and how they're gonna save the environment single handedly... as they all run around the lake in an old boat with a 1950's 2 stroke on it, that got handed down to them from Grandpa (just like the cottage they can't afford the property taxes for)"
553563,BillM,2011-02-20 04:33:00,17367,"Oh, I forgot......airplanes to!!!!!  "
553564,irishfield,2011-02-20 04:35:00,26272,LOL Bill.. I leave no trace unless I miss the filler neck with the fuel can!! I have an oil seperator on my engine breather and dump any residue elsewhere. I have absolutely no oil leaks..
553567,BillM,2011-02-20 04:44:00,17367,I wouldn't expect a drop from any of your planes Wayne
553576,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-20 06:26:00,835,"There is a already a hefty fine for putting an oil slick on a lake, I don't see where it would matter if the lake is froze or not."
553670,Billy Bob,2011-02-20 17:18:00,5865," Unless you can contain your exhaust you leave pollution wherever you go including the water. Oh, I'm sorry....it now called carbon foot print, not pollution...  On the other hand mother earth has been around a LONG time before any of us even thought about parking a big SUV on the ice and has survived quite nicely and will continue to do so....  Well that's 5 minutes of my life I'll never get back because OP decided to go trolling today..."
553672,Cookslav,2011-02-20 17:41:00,1457,Heck I think all that pesky oil residue has to be terrible for the habbitat of the magestic Cormorant.... We MUST stop parking on the ice
