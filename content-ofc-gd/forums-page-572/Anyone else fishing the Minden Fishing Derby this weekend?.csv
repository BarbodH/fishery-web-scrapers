554883,Waterfowlr,2011-02-24 00:29:00,19,"So I am heading up to Minden this weekend to fish the Minden Hills Fire Dept. Derby.  Fished it last year and had a good time.  I won a fish finder! If anyone else is going, might see you there!  Anyone else interested, proceeds go to the fire dept for gear, truck, etc...  Seems to be all lake trout that get caught.  Few details I know are: starts 8am $20 adults kids 10 under $10.  Pigeon Lake Cash prizes approx: $1000.00 plus other prizes like portable fish huts, gift cert.  PS. Anyone else ever fished this lake.  The fish I caught last year wasn't huge.  Just wondered if anyone had any suggestions on what part of the lake to fish?"
