The train goes into a dark tunnel and a few seconds later, there's the sound of a loud SLAP. When the train emerges from the tunnel, the fellow from Quebec has a bright red hand print on his cheek. No one speaks.  The little old lady thinks, the fellow from Quebec must have groped the blond in the dark and she slapped his cheek.  The blond girl thinks, that fellow from Quebec must have tried to grope me but missed and fondled the old lady, and she slapped his cheek.  The fellow from Quebec thinks, that fellow from Saskatchewan must have groped the blond in the dark. She tried to slap him but missed + got ME instead.  The fellow from Saskatchewan thinks, I can't WAIT for another tunnel so I can smack that jerk from Quebec again."
