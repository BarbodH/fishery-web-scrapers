552043,Kwan,2011-02-16 04:22:00,132,I've been thinking of planning a week or so in the Kawarthas this summer to just pitch a tent on an island or somewhere on the lakes.  Which places are possible to do so?

Drive in sites, canoeing, power boat......etc. I went on a few camping trips last year in the bancroft area on some back lakes which were accessible with my canoe strapped to the roof of my 4X4 down some logging ""roads"". Had a blast doing so. Try to find a nice island if you can as we had a few visitors come thru the camp during our stay (bears).    Good luck! Colin"
552437,Kwan,2011-02-17 04:29:00,132, yeahhh Stoney lake is wonderful!  Does anybody know any place that rents canoes for multiple days?

552446,Kwan,2011-02-17 05:52:00,132,thanks!

552627,Governator,2011-02-17 19:27:00,879,Finding a quiet island somewhere in Temagami is heaven...  Be prepared for mosquitoes & black flies though.

554379,Live2fish85,2011-02-22 16:24:00,1633,It depends on what you are going for really Stoney Lake is decent but if your thinking of doing some what of a Portage Trip there are many others that are alot better Stoney can be really busy in the summer but there are awesome lakes all around Bancroft and maple leaf which are on crown land or you can go a bit less north to like Rice Lake or Scugog but again they have more traffic but still great fishing.
