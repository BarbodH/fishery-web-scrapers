553968,laszlo,2011-02-21 14:37:00,487,Anyone ever catch one of these before? I caught this one on Sunday.  
553970,Roy,2011-02-21 14:42:00,13728,My eyes tell me that ain't no buffalo. Wrong dorsal.
553975,Roy,2011-02-21 14:46:00,13728,ok ok a smallmouth buffalo then.
553976,Spiel,2011-02-21 14:48:00,9065,Me thinks...... [/url] http://www.dnr.state...30/Default.aspx
553981,laszlo,2011-02-21 14:59:00,487,  I think your right.
553982,Spiel,2011-02-21 15:03:00,9065," Well I might as well call it a day then, not likely it'll happen twice in one day....LOL  I've hit a few of them as well as Buffalo in the Grand as incidental catches and usually (accidentally) foul hooked."
553983,hammercarp,2011-02-21 15:03:00,964,"Quillback sucker. The long dorsal spine gives it away. They also have a very distinctive looking eye, with a vertical dark bar running through it."
554000,mercman,2011-02-21 15:54:00,7054,All kinds of weird lookin critters in our lakes. Very cool looking catch
554002,solopaddler,2011-02-21 16:00:00,8605,Billions of them come spring time in the south shore Erie trib's.
554012,laszlo,2011-02-21 16:48:00,487,  Funny you say that because this one was foul hooked as well.

554310,laszlo,2011-02-22 12:33:00,487,  You may want to stay silent since you were my main partner in crime during this violation.
