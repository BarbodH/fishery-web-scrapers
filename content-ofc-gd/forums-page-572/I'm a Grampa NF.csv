553916,Garry2Rs,2011-02-21 07:27:00,1425,Hi John; Please let me add my congratulations to all of the above. Garry2R's
553918,Twocoda,2011-02-21 09:00:00,4130,Ive been a Grandparent for three years now...now you need to decide what the babe is going to call you ...i think your going to be surprised at how many different ways there is to refer to a grandfather/grandmother...personally...we went with Nanny and Poppa....reason being is ...Poppa is alot easier to say for a babe then Daddy..  CONGRATULATIONS John!!!!!...your gunna love it !  Cheers!
553963,TJQ,2011-02-21 14:17:00,7806,Fantastic!!!
553965,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-21 14:27:00,2582,"Congratulations.  If your kids have been out of the house for awhile and you have got used to being #1 in your wife's eyes...well I'm sorry to be the one to tell you that this is about to change.  You are now officially #2. And not a close #2 either....  A very very distant #2.  But it has it's perks. My grandson who's 3 in July is out with ""Gemma"" shoveling the driveway right now...while I'm sitting here in my PJ's with my coffee"
553973,JohnF,2011-02-21 14:45:00,3494,"Matt's (the proud father) generation in our family have been pretty inventive about coining grandparent handles. Wendy's folks were renamed Granny (yeah, I know, boring) and Bumpa (that's inventive) but the prize goes to Matt and his brother for naming my Mom Gabby. That's what they got out of Gramma and boy, did it catch on. She's now only known as Gabby by half the population of our town. Even her old friends call her Gabby. She loves it.  Wendy and I are just going to wait to see what the little guy comes up with for us. Anything will be good.  Here's a pic of the little prince.    I'll get him a better hat for fishing, and some polarized shades. I've already got a couple of rod setups ready. One's a short ultralite spinning rig and the other is a 4'6"" rod with a Pfleuger Underspin trigger reel, like a hybrid baitcaster/spinning reel. I don't think he'll be ready for real baitcasting for a few years. He may actually be happier with a Spiderman rig (or whoever the superhero of the day is when he's ready) but these others will be ready for him.  JF"
553989,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-21 15:16:00,2582, Same with my daughter Erika. My mother-in-law used to always say  Erika was her sweet little Chickie. So Erika started calling her Chickie right back and it stuck. All Xmas and birthday cards and gifts  from then on where signed from Chickie.  Debbe's mom loved it too..and everyone who knew her well just started calling her that too.
553999,lew,2011-02-21 15:50:00,12766,"Great news John, congratulations &  and best wishes to the entire family, but specially for the little guy !!"
554001,ketchenany,2011-02-21 15:57:00,3229,Welcome to the club John. I have 3 and on other coming in June. They are great if you don't mind having things broken.
554009,Pikeslayer,2011-02-21 16:28:00,1443," Congratulations and blessings to you and yours John. BTW, being #2 has some awesome benefits. Abuse Use them to your full advantage.  Regards, Simon"

554183,Spiel,2011-02-21 23:41:00,9065,"That's way cool John, put a smile on me face indeed. Congratulations to all the family."
553602,JohnF,2011-02-20 13:59:00,3494,"What a great gift. Our first grandchild, a healthy beautiful boy, arrived yesterday at 3 pm. Everybody's doing great.  Dunno who he looks like. Don't think there's anyone in the family with a face like a big red whithered apple and no teeth. I was holding him last night and he made an awful variety of faces at me like he was trying to poop on me but I didn't mind.  He's not very smart yet. He kept trying to get his hand to his mouth but he was all wrapped up like a ""burrito"" as my son described the wrapping job when the nurse showed him how. I snuck one of his little hands out in the open but he just kept trying to munch on the burritoed one. Holding him is like holding a little furnace. He'd be a handy little guy in an ice hut.  I have a pic of me holding him here somewhere. Maybe I'll post it later.  JF"
553604,fish_fishburn,2011-02-20 14:02:00,1311,Congratulations John. A very special moment for sure.  Glad to hear everyone is doing well.

553710,JohnF,2011-02-20 19:45:00,3494, I was afraid my wife was going to try to steal him at the hospital last night. She's floating on air right now. I don't think sending him home will be the problem for a while. It will be more about her letting him go home.  JF
553711,Big Cliff,2011-02-20 19:46:00,6899,Well congratulations Grandpa! Just remember you load them up with chocolate JUST before you send them home to mom and dad LOL.
