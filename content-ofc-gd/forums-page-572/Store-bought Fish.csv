554244,Rizzo,2011-02-22 01:51:00,4754,I don't even eat the fish I catch so I definitely will not be buying any at the store. I just wish I could catch some shrimp because I do enjoy those tasty little buggers!
554250,aplumma,2011-02-22 02:01:00,6896, One of my friends is a Seafood wholesale/retailer and the tricks of the trade of the dishonest are down right frightening.I won't tell you the possibilities on shrimp... just enjoy them most merchants are on the up and up and will give you a fit product.   Art
554303,Jer,2011-02-22 11:58:00,1426,"A friend of mine bought a bag of chinese ""cod"" fillets a little while back. He said they tried them prepared in every way possible and still chucked the remainder in the trash, it was that bad. They're a British couple so they know their cod."
554317,fish_fishburn,2011-02-22 12:47:00,1311,Bigugli nailed this question right on the head.
554326,Billy Bob,2011-02-22 13:06:00,5865,"NEVER have to buy fish with Lake Erie less then 10 miles away.....HOWEVER, it's the vegetables that you have to be EXTREMELY careful with when buying...don't like my veggies fertilized with human waste...."
554370,Jonny,2011-02-22 15:56:00,1380," How is Erie fish for contaminants nowadays? I thought you still had to be careful how much you consume.  Veggies... you sure have a point there. Lots of produce in supermarkets comes from China now. Snow peas, garlic, a number of types of fruit, etc. Sometimes there's no alternative - i.e. it's very hard to find Can/Am garlic.  (I know Leechman will say ""Grow yer own!"")   "
554374,Leecher,2011-02-22 16:08:00,7832, You've read my mind Jocko  and yep
554382,bigugli,2011-02-22 16:30:00,6138,"Lots of good produce at the farmers markets as long as you seek out the farmers and avoid the jobbers. Just need to learn the old skills of canning, preserving and stockpiling. I don't buy produce in winter because I like to know where my produce came from, and who grew it.  I do know what is in the produce coming across the border, how it is processed , packed and stored."
554383,mercman,2011-02-22 16:30:00,7054, Bob !!! Poop is poop What diff does it make?Its knowing WHICH that makes it YUCKY !!!!!!
554418,Billy Bob,2011-02-23 00:19:00,5865," Lake Erie is no different then most any other lake unless you like to eat big old lake trout......  Garlic grows in the garden and is also available growing wild here....We also have a lot of green beans every year and some are still in the deep freezer....but there a some things that don't taste the same frozen, like tomatoes..."
554422,Billy Bob,2011-02-23 00:22:00,5865, It's the Mexican E-coli I shy away from....
554435,Jonny,2011-02-23 00:30:00,1380," Thanks, fishnsled... There's a LOT of good information here. I'd recommend that anybody who hasn't read it do so now.  Seems to me if they're doing that much testing of Chinese and Vietnamese fish products, you'd want to make sure to stay away from them.  There's also a section there about how the Chinese destroyed the Cdn garlic industry.  GRRRRR!   "
554456,bigugli,2011-02-23 01:01:00,6138,"Don't worry about the garlic. China has had a catastrophic garlic crop failure. They had buyers in Ontario paying upwards of $500 a bushel for seed stock. A lot of folks remember how they got screwed last time, and won't sell to them. Besides, Chinese garlic tends to lack the hardiness and shelf life."
554472,pikehunter,2011-02-23 01:19:00,1659," I hear ya but where do you think those tanker trucks full of sludge from the sewage plants are heading to? Right to the farm, that's where.  I see China on a food label and I usually drop it then and there, what is still worrysome is whare are all the ingredients in processed food coming from? From countries you don't want it to come from is the answer. You can't escape 3rd. world food unless you know the exact location your food came from. So all natural, local grown or raised and no store bought spices or additives. Even then who really knows"
554478,Billy Bob,2011-02-23 01:26:00,5865," I order all my beets from the Dwight Schrute Farm in Scranton, PA...."
554484,pikehunter,2011-02-23 01:36:00,1659,"Scranton Pa. ...30,000 pounds of bananas, Jim Croce. Always comes to mind when I hear the words Scranton Pa.  BTW, those sludge trucks all have their GPS units tuned to Shrutes farm LOL"
554493,Billy Bob,2011-02-23 01:50:00,5865," Thanks, PH....that quote made my laugh of the day......  :rofl2:  :good:"
554061,Jonny,2011-02-21 19:11:00,1380,"It's getting so we should prize our own sport-fishing catch more and more as far as eating quality is concerned.  Have you checked out the supermarket selection for frozen fish lately? Read the fine print on the back of the packages and you will find, disturbingly often, ""Product of China"". It's not only on fish we associate with the Far East like basa or tilapia, but on cod, haddock, salmon, sole, lots of the species we buy and associate with Canadian or American catch.  There are some ""mystery fish"" thrown into the mix like Product of China blue cod. What the heck is ""blue cod"".  There are ""Highliner"" processed fish products, supposedly Canadian, that also read ""Product of China"" when you check the fine print on the back.  I suppose these products have to pass inspection before being sold in Canada, but you can well imagine (I can!) the conditions under which these Far Eastern fish are raised, or caught, or cleaned or stored. Canadian catch and Canadian facilities could be bad enough; imagine what it's like over there.  When you catch and clean your own fish, from your own waters, you know the quality (top quality) you're getting.  Enjoy it!  (And, I would say, look for Canadian or American origin when you have to buy fish in a supermarket!) "
554069,scugpg,2011-02-21 19:19:00,1373,"That's scary. There are many Canadian companies out there that you assume products are made here. Time to get used to reading the fine print. Heck start even looking on candy wrappers and other process foods - much is coming from offshore these days!  I like my food to be as free from contaminants as possible. Not saying Canada is perfect but there are many other countries with not so good environmental records and/or reputations. Even with fish I don't eat great lakes fish often if at all and try to stick to inland lakes w/o much contimanation. Even that can be tricky, as some lakes have naturally occurring mercury for eg.  Thanks for the heads up!"
554071,irishfield,2011-02-21 19:25:00,26272, Don't always be so sure about that either Jocko !  I also find the fillets taste much better if you remove the red patch. Well honed knife and it carves right off..
554083,Jonny,2011-02-21 20:04:00,1380," You're right about that. I don't buy Made in China candies or confections for my grand-kids either. Partly because of quality concerns, partly because I'd rather support Canadian and American businesses.    Right you are. It's a good idea to read the safe consumption booklet from the Ontario gov't. But minimal concern if you're careful, I think.  The red usually doesn't bother me. I like my pike to have more taste than pickerel; sometimes I find pickerel a little bland. (Sacrilege I know!)   "
554085,danjang,2011-02-21 20:13:00,148,I'm not sure if this is credible. But I heard it's not  uncommon to raise/catch fish here and ship it over to china for processing and packaging and have it sent right back to us. Apparently it's just cheaper that way.
554086,Fisherman,2011-02-21 20:17:00,7201,"When I buy, I go to Johnnys Fresh Fish & Seafood on Bryne Dr in Barrie, so far I'm not glowing in the dark."
554088,Jonny,2011-02-21 20:19:00,1380," You could very well be right, although it makes no sense to me either. I mean when you get ""Wild Pacific Salmon"" and it's marked ""Product of China"" (I see that all the time), you wonder where it was caught. Is there a big salmon fishery in the Far East/Siberian coast/ etc? Not that I know of.   "
554090,Jonny,2011-02-21 20:22:00,1380," Some of the big supermarkets have fresh fish counters too. I wonder, if you asked would they be able to tell you where the fish came from?  I would assume that fish which is sold as fresh would be Canadian/American fish, but assuming things is often enough a dumb thing to do!   "
554091,misfish,2011-02-21 20:26:00,29133,"  Ya bet yer   . He,s got the best.Thats where I buy aswell.  While at work saturday,I just phoned him up and ordered,2 pound lobster steamed,long neck clams steamed also picked up scallops and some of his great smoked rainbow trout.  Betty was happy with the seafood pasta I made and the lobster/shrimp stirfry the next day."
554092,Governator,2011-02-21 20:26:00,879,"It's all about the buck, I bet they found it's a lot cheaper to export fish to china for processing and then reship back than it is to setup factory & employ here.  Pretty sad really."
554099,bigugli,2011-02-21 20:54:00,6138,"Many nations have fleets of floating factories that fish outside territorial waters then bring the catch home for distribution. Such fleets fly the flags of China, Japan, Norway, Portugal, to name a few. There is nothing new in any of this. The only thing new is in being forced to actually I.D. the nation packing the fish."
554105,aplumma,2011-02-21 21:06:00,6896,A lot of the seafood that is caught in international waters  off the coast of Canada/ USA are processed on board and then sold to Canada/ USA as a foreign product depending on the country of Documentation of the vessel. Some of the ships that are in Canada/ USA may have an office in China just for the tax breaks and lack of stiff rules so they can Document the vessel for the benefits. So an all Canadian crew/boat can be selling the made in China products to Canada. So hows that for thickening the plot here.   Art
554113,Joey,2011-02-21 21:16:00,9122,"Well I do alot of C & R, but I do keep a few for the table, so there is no need to buy fish in our house!"
554118,Jonny,2011-02-21 21:22:00,1380,"Pretty good!  So a catch doesn't have to be landed in China and/or processed in China to be ""Product of China"" ?  Chinese boats can sell their catches straight from the boat to Can/Am processors?  I did not know that. "
554119,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-21 21:23:00,2582, Same here Joey.  The only fish we buy is canned tuna.  And sushi...which I don't count.
554134,misfish,2011-02-21 21:37:00,29133,"Steve  You come up for a fish,you will get the best cuts to make yer own sushi..."
554139,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-21 21:44:00,4399,The last time we had Tilapia I looked at the package and it said product of Vietnam needless to say Tilapia has been scratched from the diet!
554158,Leecher,2011-02-21 22:20:00,7832, I agree 100% with what you said Joey I only eat the fish I catch when I have a little craving for it   the rest go back as well
554161,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-21 22:25:00,2582, I've never tried to make my own...but I sure would love to. You have knowledge or tips on this Brian?  BTW I haven't been on the ice for 3 weeks  ...2 because of work and I had to cancel on a buddy this weekend cause I was sick as hell yesterday.  Hopefully we can hook up once this winter.
554163,pics,2011-02-21 22:34:00,1268,"Basa is also a product of Vietnam, farmed on the same river that carries raw sewage and chemicals from unregulated factories........ Just seen it at Walmart... As for Tilapia, if you knew what they were fed you wouldn't eat it....."
554164,fishnsled,2011-02-21 22:37:00,3520,This episode of Marketplace was on a couple of years ago. Your post reminded me of it and thought I would share the link here.  Product of Canada Eh?
554191,misfish,2011-02-22 00:18:00,29133,"  Get yer    up here this Saturday for the Tyler event. I,ll pm you later in the week."
554199,bigugli,2011-02-22 00:33:00,6138,"Sorry, but the offshore vessels have offshore crews. Flags of convenience do exist, 90% of American owned bottoms use such flags as Panama, Liberia, etc...  They also rely on cheap offshore crews and Lascars. However, factory ships do all the processing from start to finish. The do not need land based facilities. Canadian fisheries have been destroyed by bureaucratic regulation and incompetence. The boys down east aren't working on Chinese or Portuguese vessels. They cost far more than the $2 a day crews used on foreign vessels."
554202,misfish,2011-02-22 00:35:00,29133," Dont go there Bruce,this stuff pisses me off."
554207,bigugli,2011-02-22 00:44:00,6138,It's pissed off many a friend who've lost their livelihoods and way of life. Highliner is mostly a sham. Canadian in name only. They buy up offshore fleets to do the catching.
