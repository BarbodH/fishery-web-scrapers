553765,ColdH20guy,2011-02-20 22:38:00,312,"as they say. ""anyone but Stewart"""
553767,irishfield,2011-02-20 22:39:00,26272,Junior's team got him in that.. taking their sweet time on the  pit stop!  Kid deserved that... pushed the 6 car for laps and laps before he was dumb and dropped down on that restart.  Notice.. not a scratch on the kids car either...
553769,Grimace,2011-02-20 22:42:00,2020,Awesome.  That was wicked.
553772,misfish,2011-02-20 22:46:00,29133,"  I was sitting here yelling at the tv,what the hell,4 tires?????????????"
553774,irishfield,2011-02-20 22:49:00,26272,He had a flat left rear.. but there was no effort to get him back out.. putting him in the pack..
553778,Muskieman,2011-02-20 22:51:00,2472,FORD   #1  #2   #3... exactly how it should be.
553780,Banger68,2011-02-20 22:54:00,157,Cool finish!
553781,splashhopper,2011-02-20 22:54:00,2931,  I was wondering the same thing
553783,misfish,2011-02-20 22:56:00,29133," You seen that little ""what ever kick"" to the back bumper too eh?"
553788,Gerritt,2011-02-20 23:03:00,6129,"""OMG am I dreaming!!??""  Way to go kid. Good young lad right there."
553820,tb4me,2011-02-21 00:16:00,3295,awesome race today....Lots of action for daytona..One of the best I have seen in years there..
553844,jedimaster,2011-02-21 00:45:00,3472,"Good for the kid, but it's gonna take some time or me to get into this new draft setup, just feela like a fix the whole way around. Doesn't feel like they are racing. No doubt they are but it just doesnt feel like racing."
553936,corvette1,2011-02-21 13:08:00,1765,thats not racing it's crap
553991,Mike Pike,2011-02-21 15:20:00,1332,"As a huge Ford fan, it was great to see the Fords 1, 2, 3.  There have been some pretty lean years for Ford fans in Nascar and I hope this is the start of a competative manufacturer's race again.  I remember when I first got into Nascar racing in the late '80s and the Fords were competative with the Chevs( and Pontiacs, at that time ).  Still can't believe a 20 year old won the Daytona 500.  And I think his birthday was just the day before!"
554217,jedimaster,2011-02-22 01:10:00,3472,"Also I didn't feel like I had any idea what was happening in the pits, it was just a mess the tv coverage felt so ambiguous. I am glad I am not the only one that doesn't like this dancing partner bananas versus racing. I think this will take alot of the driver versus driver out of the series. That's what I like about NASCAR. F1 I also like but it's more machine versus machine. Not as much about the driver."

553720,splashhopper,2011-02-20 20:30:00,2931,"i think the new ""bump draft"" that is allowed for the first time this year at Daytona is sloooowing the race down... caution after caution after caution ..."
553725,jedimaster,2011-02-20 20:36:00,3472,This whole bump drafting thing is gay. Takes away from the actual racing. It's more like f1 now. Not at all like NASCAR racing.  I am not impressed.
553727,misfish,2011-02-20 20:43:00,29133,Tony and jr.Knew it would happen.
