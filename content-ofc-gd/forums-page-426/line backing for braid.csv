For example the braid just pulls off the spool without any drag being used, also I cast out and find that i cannot reel in my bait and have to pull it in by hand. I'm pretty sure that it is because the braid isnt on tight on enough. Now onto my question, what kind of line do you use for backing? I heard from a buddy of mine that if you put some electrical tape or hockey tape on the spool before you tie the braid on and spool your reel it helps, can anyone else say the same? Thanks Bassmaster4"
680551,Joeytier,2012-03-27 15:11:00,3990,I use whatever 8-12 lb mono I happen to have kicking around and put maybe 20-25 yards on.  Use a back-to-back uni and connect your braid.

680557,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 15:20:00,4661,i just tie it on the spool like normal... then put a piece of electrical tape over the loop you just formed around the spool... then fill her up with some tension on the line...  always works for me... never slips...
680569,bassmaster4,2012-03-27 15:57:00,801,"thanks guys! drifter, i used your video and did it exactly how he showed, the knots were tricky lol now im all spooled up and ready to go thanks a lot!"
680578,Fish4Eyes,2012-03-27 16:17:00,1022,"Even though its too late now since you've done it, but on larger capacity spools I like to put extra mono so that I need to use less braid. Over the years I have found that when I replace my braid, 3/4 into the spool the braid has not even touched water, so may as well fill that part in with mono."
680581,bassmaster4,2012-03-27 16:20:00,801,"thanks anyway fish 4 eyes, a good way to save line and save money. Will definately do that next time i go to respool. Thanks again"
680642,Raf,2012-03-27 18:47:00,3495,next time you re-spool just reverse the line that's currently on your reel if you filled it completely with braid.  it's be good as new.
