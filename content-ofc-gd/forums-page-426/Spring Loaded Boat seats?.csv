I am trying to find some type of seat or seat attachment that will take the pounding away from my spine.I have seen the ""Smooth Moves seat"". I am in a 19 foot boat with the walk through windshield.Thanks"

678410,trapshooter,2012-03-22 03:28:00,1234,I've ridden in boats with the Smooth Moves seats before.  Something you need to experience first hand to understand how awesome they are.

678565,aplumma,2012-03-22 18:57:00,6896,Back in 2000 I used this seat frame and mounted a marine seat to it for my comfort shock absorber tractor seat. It is also mounted on my ZTR lawnmower and both are doing just fine.   Art
678599,Garnet,2012-03-22 20:24:00,2056,Google Industrial Seats. Air ride seats for heavy trucks. Way back in the late 80's they made marine models that I had installed in a bass boat. Worked great just very expensive.
678621,Tybo,2012-03-22 21:23:00,1373,I have a hydraulic shock type in the boat.Works pretty good in rough water.    
678628,lew,2012-03-22 21:54:00,12766,"My Skeeter came equipped with  seats  made by Springfield Marine and are known as Air-Adjustable.  They basically ride on a cushion of air and are very comfortable in rough water and take out all the harsh bangs associated with pounding the waves. Very nice in rough water when you feel the seat more or less floating under you.  They can be adjusted up and down as much as 6"" and also have sliders built into the mount so the seats can move front to back about 6"" also.  "
