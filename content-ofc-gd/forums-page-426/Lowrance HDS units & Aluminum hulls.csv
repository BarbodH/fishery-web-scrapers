680211,Lunker777,2012-03-26 16:55:00,866,Hey everyone  I want to pick up either a HDS 5 or 7 this year for my boat. Is it possible to run Structure scan with an aluminum hull boat ?  Are any of you doing this ??? Whats the power consumption of a HDS unit ???  Thanks in advance !!!
680216,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-26 17:11:00,10439,Hull type doesn't matter as the structure scan transducer is mounted off the stern the same as a regular transducer.
680217,Terry,2012-03-26 17:13:00,14456,I run it with an aluminum hall on the outside and sticking out from the transom... you can't shoot through the hull   they sure like eating power a hds 5 takes two 7amp batteries to run it on the ice for 8 hours you can double the time if you lower the back light to a minimum which is hard to do in direct sunlight
680220,Nipfisher,2012-03-26 17:18:00,2449,  Yep I learned that this year. I could get 4-5 hours with my HDS5 on the ice. I ajusted the brightness lower but not as low as it would go as I couldn`t see the screen well.
680248,Dan668,2012-03-26 18:36:00,1120,"If you want structure scan, go with the biggest screen you can afford. Also lss2 is coming out very soon. Supposed to be better"
680249,Terry,2012-03-26 18:41:00,14456,"HDS 5 is too small for structure scan, I added a HDS8, now it's great"
680250,scugpg,2012-03-26 18:42:00,1373, I saw a good discussion on the LSS2 here http://www.thehulltruth.com/marine-electronics-forum/412250-structurescan-hd-lss-2-first-impressions.html  Keep in mind the size of the LSS2 transducer (see pic in above link)...it sticks out at least 4 inches farther than the LSS1...motor would have to be trimmed up far to not get in the way. Good rebates on LSS1s and other Lowrance HDS products right now.  Jocelyn at Angling Outfitters up in Woodstock should be able to help you get setup
680253,Pikeslayer,2012-03-26 19:02:00,1443,"I run structure scan with HDS7 on my Sylvan. Transom mount transducer and yes they do draw a lot of power. (what Terry said). Mine is connected to my auxilary battery which is connected to my kicker w/alternator. I would think twice about connecting it to your cranking battery??  Disclaimer- I am not electrically profficeint. If I've mentioned something wrong in the above statement, feel free to correct me."
680254,Dan668,2012-03-26 19:15:00,1120,"They do draw alot of power, i always turn the brightness down.  I seen that discussion on the lss2. Im torn on whether to grab it or get another lss1 for the bow because of the rebate."
680258,Terry,2012-03-26 19:24:00,14456,"don't quote me on this I might be making the whole thing up or have the facts wrong  but I had heard maybe a year ago that Lowrance was in court about the design of the LSS1 and they had to change it to meet the patent rules...and nothing said that they were making it better just changing it....to keep humminbird happy  so the LSS1 may be better then the LSS2, except for the new longer transducer which is better so I hear"
