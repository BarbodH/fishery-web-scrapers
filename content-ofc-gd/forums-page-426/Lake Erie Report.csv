680143,Billy Bob,2012-03-26 13:38:00,5865,"I got out once on Lake Erie and did well.......but planned on another trip on Erie last Friday, however the stupid weather dork said somewhat high winds out of the NE with 3 footers.....so we took the LOOOOOONG ride to Chautauqua Lake for some crappies......all the way down there as we rode along the south shore of Erie there was NO wind......but the trip to Chautauqua was worth it......we scored big time putting a hurt on the crappie population down there...and I would rather eat crappies then any other fish that swims...  BTW.....THANKS for the FARM REPORT...."
