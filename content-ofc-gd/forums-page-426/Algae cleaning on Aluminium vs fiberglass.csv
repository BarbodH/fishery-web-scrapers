Always did a great job and had no ill effects on the hull.  Now we are looking at getting an aluminum boat and wondered if the same toilet bowl cleaner can be used on an allumnium hull? My worry is that the cleaner would strip the coating/decal on the aluminum. ( we are looking at princecraft/lund)  Thoughts??"
