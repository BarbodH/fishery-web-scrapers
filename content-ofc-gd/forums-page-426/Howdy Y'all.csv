680129,FishHeadRic,2012-03-26 12:47:00,226,"Hey Gang!  It's been a while since I've posted anything here. Been lurking but not really posting much being that I mostly fish the surf and salt now. Been down here on Long Island for almost 5 years already. Learning, re-learning the ins and outs of working the extremly harsh conditions down here. Got me a fleet of kayaks and a couple of boston whalers to get out on the water but putting on the wet suit and hopping boulders and getting pummeled off rocks in the surf has taken over most of my free time... LOVE IT!          These shots are from Montauk Point on the end of long Island.    School of bait getting blitzed!      30lb class fish crashing the breakers!           Bigger the storm, better the fishing! I've gotten to see some amazing things over the last few years fishing down here.Hopefully going into another great season. If any of ya ever make yer way down here and wanna have a good ole time drop me a line!   FHR"
