680430,mercman,2012-03-27 01:46:00,7054,"It is an awesome site !!! If you look to the south east, there is another planet starting to catch up with this cluster.Not sure which it is. Reminds me of the song ""Age if Aquarius"""
680432,irishfield,2012-03-27 01:53:00,26272,South / East? I'm currently looking at Moon and the two plants one above each directly to the WEST
680434,Nipfisher,2012-03-27 01:54:00,2449,"Ummmm those are windows Nick, and you're a peeping tom...lol. Just kidding. Theses clear cold nights are great for seeing the night sky."
680437,Bernie,2012-03-27 01:58:00,3190,"Saturn is just rising in the east, Mars is higher up and reddish colour. The moon is beside Venus."
680445,Pikeslayer,2012-03-27 02:03:00,1443,"   ""Age if Aquarious, south/east, planet, moon, two plants, west""  Deja vu"
680451,mercman,2012-03-27 02:11:00,7054,"  ok it moved  then. I can see it.Much fainter than the others. Right now, faceing south, its at about the 1o'clock position"
680452,mercman,2012-03-27 02:14:00,7054,  all over again...
675901,Gerritt,2012-03-14 01:11:00,6129,"Take a look to the West southwest.... see those to glaring ""stars""? those are Venus and Jupiter pairing up..  It is something to see... they dwarf everything else in the sky tonight...  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17312354  Hopefully other OFC'rs can see em... they look awesome here!   G.  Thanks to my buddy Steve for letting me know about this."
675908,solopaddler,2012-03-14 01:21:00,8605,"  I just stepped outside 15 mins ago, saw them and was wondering.  Thanks Gerritt, very cool!"
675910,danc,2012-03-14 01:21:00,4677,Stepped outside my motel room in Dryden and there was no mistaking where they were Gerritt. We are just at dusk here with still a little blue in the sky. Pretty cool. Thanks for pointing that out.
675911,irishfield,2012-03-14 01:22:00,26272,Clouded over here...
675912,tonka-toy,2012-03-14 01:24:00,139,"I was checking them out at dusk in scarborough.Thanks for clearing up what it was, the kids had me stumped about the bright stars."
675913,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-03-14 01:26:00,83,Thanks for the post Gerritt. I'll be near Bancroft this weekend and lets hope the west sky is clear to see this.
675914,Live2fish85,2012-03-14 01:30:00,1633,Thats cool i am going to check.
675925,Blue Lk,2012-03-14 01:39:00,337," Funny thing,I am about 20 miles west (Eagle River area),was just on the deck & noticed the same thing,came inside & read your post. Thx for the heads up Gerritt."
675926,Joey,2012-03-14 01:40:00,9122,"Thanks Gerritt, just checked it on my Starmapro and it pointed me in the right direction, went out and sure enough, there they were all bright and shiny."
675928,Bernie,2012-03-14 01:45:00,3190,"I have been watching the progression of them all winter. A couple weeks ago, just a sliver of the new moon was in between them. Looked pretty cool!  I am also watching the eastern horizon for the arrival of the star Arcturus before midnight.  When I see it over the hill to my east I know spring has arrived.  Orion is sinking to the west more every evening.  Here is a good way to find out what is in the sky at night. Night sky"
675947,Whopper,2012-03-14 02:23:00,2174,Very clear down here tonight and the view is spectacular
675951,NAW,2012-03-14 02:37:00,4022,They caught my eye a few times on the drive home.  Was wondering what they where..  Thanks for the info
675957,Gerritt,2012-03-14 02:43:00,6129,  Very cool link.... Thanks B!
675965,adempsey,2012-03-14 02:57:00,1498,"I have been viewing the planets with my telescope on and off for the past couple of weeks.  Venus is incredibly bright. At first I thought it was Jupiter.  You can also see Mars and Saturn quite clearly, but Saturn doesn't come out until later in the evening.   This site is great if you want to watch some live video broadcast from amateur astronomers  http://www.nightskiesnetwork.com/  Some of them are quite good."
675969,Skipper D,2012-03-14 03:16:00,1970,"Awsome to know , for a while i thought they made the space station bigger making it easy'r to see .......lol"
675970,bigugli,2012-03-14 03:19:00,6138,Been watching the past couple of weeks while walking the dog.
675983,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-14 03:56:00,0,i was wondering what those bright stars in the sky were earlier this evening.. thanks for the heads up.
676015,mercman,2012-03-14 11:39:00,7054," Same here. It""s been amazing to see them getting closer every day.I wasn't sure what i was seeing originally, but Google educated me rather quickly"
676035,l2p,2012-03-14 13:00:00,346,"Man was it ever a clear view last night... was out fishing late and the star show was phenomenal, even saw a couple shooting stars"
676054,jedimaster,2012-03-14 14:14:00,3472,"Saw it myself, just in case I wipped over to canadian tire and bought some axe deoderant and a couple boxes of buckshot shells. I was sure if it meant I was gonna hook up with swedish bikini models, or turn into a zombie. I figured I would be prepared either way."
676281,pikehunter,2012-03-15 02:16:00,1659," Me too, saw them when I was coming home from the store down the street and thought ""Hey look at the neat looking stars"""
676295,Handlebarz,2012-03-15 02:34:00,3790,I went and told the wife this and she laughed at me then told me I should listen to her more as these are the same two stars I have been watching (planets to all others) for a long time now what do I know not much but my I phone has a night sky app that is very cool just hold the phone to the sky and it will show you all the stars and planets and just about anything else except your neighbor.
676435,Mike Pike,2012-03-15 17:31:00,1332,Hey thanks for that Gerritt!  Saw them last night and it was pretty neat knowing what planets they were.  Kinda makes me wish I new more about astronomy.
676451,blaque,2012-03-15 18:27:00,2419,"THANKS FOR THIS POST!!!!!  I was in New Jersey with my Boss and they stuck out like a sore thumb when we stepped out of the bar. He wasnt very thrown by the sight, and didnt pay it much attention. I was befuddled at what i was looking at and thank you for the explanation."
680416,NAW,2012-03-27 01:11:00,4022,"Tonight the moon was right beside one of the planets.. Not sure if it was Venus or Jupiter.  Either way, I got out for a few pictures.   I wish they where a little better quality, but they're the best I can do with my lens.  I've been trying for weeks to get a decent shot.    "
