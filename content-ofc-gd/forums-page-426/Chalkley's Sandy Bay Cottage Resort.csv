680162,Toddyc20,2012-03-26 14:35:00,141,"I am planning to attend Chalkley's Sandy Bay Cottage Resort this coming June and I'm just wondering if anyone has had any experience with this resort?  Also how is the fishing in the area near the resort?  We will be targeting Pike, Bass, Walleye and probably I'll throw some Muskie baits.  Thanks in advance for the information"
680171,Nipfisher,2012-03-26 15:02:00,2449,Pretty sure our member sandybay is Jeff Chalkley. PM him. I have read his posts on other forums and he is always a big help. Lots of good fishing on South Shore and Jeff knows the area well.
680197,Bitsmith2k,2012-03-26 16:11:00,396,we've stayed there a bunch of times early june.. i really liked the place and jeff was always great to us.. we always did well with the walleye and pike.. last time we were up there the weather wasnt on our side (really windy)...
680238,Toddyc20,2012-03-26 17:55:00,141, Thanks that is good to know.  Nice to hear good things about the place too.  My friend' father lives in north bay and said he's heard nothing but great things so I'm really excited to stay there.
680283,Kingsalmon,2012-03-26 20:24:00,107," I've been going to Jeff's on and off for over 15 years now.   Jeff's a nice friendly guy and is always helpful.  Their prices are really good compared to others around the lake.  Its not a 5 star resort but it has nice clean cottages and everything you need for fishing in June.  Hey by the way this spring is going, you are going to be able to swim on the awesome beach.  Fishing wise, in a normal June, you could catch as many pickerel (walleye) as you want within sight of the resort.  If this warm spring continues the pickerel will be on the mid lake humps that are 5-15 minutes away.  Ask Jeff for the fishing hotspots at the time.  He knows where they are.  I'm pretty sure he'll chime in on this message as well.  Have fun."
680308,Jer,2012-03-26 21:37:00,1426,We've done a couple of hardwater trips to Sandy Bay several years ago. Had a great time. Jeff runs a top-notch operation.
680537,Toddyc20,2012-03-27 14:54:00,141,Does anyone know where I can find a decent depth chart for this area?  Looks like there could be a few hazards in the area.
