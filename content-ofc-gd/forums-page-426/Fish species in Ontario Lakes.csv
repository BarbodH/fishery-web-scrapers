679376,Bigworm,2012-03-24 17:42:00,119,  Thanks
680349,nancur373,2012-03-26 23:08:00,1211,According to this site there is whitefish in Pigeon Lake. Is this true????
680357,Christopheraaron,2012-03-26 23:19:00,3525,"Probably, if you think about it lake simcoe is filled with them and the trent connects all of those lakes.  But I'm not quite sure on the accuracy of other lakes, does lake simcoe really have brown and brook trout?"
680359,Moosebunk,2012-03-26 23:21:00,3970,"Site has been out a little while.  Not perfect with it's info and could use some fine tuning with some lakes, it's not a bad idea and it's a pretty good start.  Hope they keep up with it.  Something like this would be great if you could find a lake and get info such as stocking, when and how many fish, or even just accuracy with the species list."

680681,Jer,2012-03-27 20:51:00,1426,"   ...I keep hearing it was all Mike Harris' fault...for some reason with Dalton, nothing seems to stick...but lets not get political."
