Balsam.. the entire trent channel is open from Kirkfield to Balsam as best I could see. Channel is opening below the Kirkfield lift locks. Just happened to be across there to Coboconk today to recover an airplane that played with a tree!
676372,Squid,2012-03-15 13:28:00,1656,Lake Ontario is ice free!
676608,chris.brock,2012-03-16 01:30:00,4053,"I believe it, I bought rye from Cuba, tastes like drinking gasoline, I'll save it for when we have guests over"
676768,BucktownAngler,2012-03-16 16:32:00,582,anybody know Mitchell/Canal conditions?
676849,jedimaster,2012-03-16 20:18:00,3472,I am going to be in port perry tonight I'll scope out the ramps on scugog and post back... Anyone in the muskokas have an eye?
676857,Sinker,2012-03-16 20:49:00,8692,"Rice is wide open. Was out yesterday. No crappies, but we caught every other specie!  S."
676901,jedimaster,2012-03-16 22:56:00,3472,Scugog looks wide open as far as I can see and the boat launch in town is also free of ice. No dock in but people have launched as there are trailers in the lot.
677204,Bob,2012-03-18 03:26:00,370,"Checked out two of the lakes in town today, they're getting wet around the edges. Forecasts in the teens for next few days so not too long.  I've been here over 30 years and the earliest I've seen Elliot Lake open is April 15th. Might be considerably earlier this year."
677274,fishnsled,2012-03-18 16:46:00,3520,"Balsam - main lake still frozen. Mitchell - canal open but bays and lake still frozen. Simcoe - Beaverton side, lots of ice still out there. I would think that most of these areas should be ice free soon. Nice day for a drive...."
677309,irishfield,2012-03-18 19:53:00,26272,Orr Lake is dark green today.. will be gone tomorrow!
677329,Billy Bob,2012-03-18 21:54:00,5865,I am happy to report all lakes down here in the Great State of New York are all open and fishing is going on FULL THROTTLE....     Bob
677340,Bernie,2012-03-18 22:25:00,3190,Open water showing on Fish Bay on Nipissing. Couple more days and it will be wide open. Crazy!....I drove my truck on it a week ago and it was a solid block.
677587,misfish,2012-03-19 18:52:00,29133,Cant launch yet.A few days yet.  Tiffin      Barrie marina     
677599,BucktownAngler,2012-03-19 19:30:00,582,thx for the updates
677780,Bigfisherman,2012-03-20 01:28:00,100,Anyone near Orillia? is the Orillia launch clear enough to go to the narrows?
677817,jedimaster,2012-03-20 03:34:00,3472,Going up to 26 on wednesday.... Say good bye to the ice....
677820,irishfield,2012-03-20 03:42:00,26272, It was still iced in as of Wednesday afternoon if you're talking the launch across from the rec center on #12.. West of the narrows on the 4 lane. Ice could well be gone by now though.
677856,oldphart,2012-03-20 12:30:00,665,"~~~~As reported Simcoe main lake wide open, but there are some nasty little bergs, and ice sheets still floating around, between Thoarh and Georgina, there is a large sheet still intact,"
680098,fishinggeek,2012-03-26 05:30:00,325,Anyone know if the Muskoka lakes are clear yet? I would go see for myself but it is a bit far of a drive to be disappointed.
675649,jedimaster,2012-03-13 16:18:00,3472,"Well just thought I would post this to get some updates on the ice out... If you near the water post the lake date and open water reports... Specifically I was wondering if the Kawartha lakes are open yet, but post for whatever lake you know."
675651,Roy,2012-03-13 16:21:00,13728,"Except for a few sheltered bays, the St Lawrence is wide open."
675653,lew,2012-03-13 16:27:00,12766,Clear Lake in the Kawarthas is still covered but the neighbors dog went thru the ice this morning near shore so it would appear it won't be too much longer till ice out.  The pooch got out OK.
675656,Skipper D,2012-03-13 16:34:00,1970,The bay in Barrie is still full according to the bay cam .
675659,jeffw,2012-03-13 16:42:00,267,sections of the Holland river have been open for over a week now. Might try and get out this weekend and try for pike and crappie.
675663,Kawartha Kev,2012-03-13 17:02:00,281,I posted this link to a webcam from Lower Buckhorn in the Kawartha's in another thread recently so here it is again. It is from Reach Harbour which is about halfway down the lake and as you will see the main channel is wide open just click on the webcam button at the top of the pageLower Buckhorn in the Kawarthas  Kawartha Kev
675668,whiskywizard,2012-03-13 17:13:00,305,"Scugog River from Lindsay to Sturgeon Lake is wide open, of course, and the very south end of the lake is ""centre bare"". The channel is fully open out to beyond the navigation buoys, and it's widening so fast you can see it happening.  The bays at the south end still have some ice but it's punky and melting fast. It just barely supports the Canada geese!   This week, with temps in the teens, should open up some launch ramps."
675671,BucktownAngler,2012-03-13 17:20:00,582,"anybody have any info on Mitchell, Canal, or Balsam?  would like to get into some pike action"
675672,danbouck,2012-03-13 17:25:00,4380,Long Point has been open since Feb 2011
675674,Pikeslayer,2012-03-13 17:30:00,1443, Hey Whiskey. I'm in your 'hood' this Sat & Sun. Hopefully with the help of some strong winds and the warm temps we might be doing some soft water fishing :thumbsup_anim: .  Slayer
675683,Beans,2012-03-13 17:43:00,3339,On Sunday the north end of Pigeon was still frozen except out from the mouth of the river in town...can see lots of open water from the big bridge and can't tell how far it is open in the current area to the south between Big Island and the west shore...
675685,whiskywizard,2012-03-13 17:44:00,305, I can't believe how fast it's melting! I think you might be OK by the weekend Simon.Where will you launch?
675687,RickOnt,2012-03-13 17:45:00,669,West side of Simcoe from Innisfil Beach Park to the Islands and up to Oro appears to be Ice free.  Rick
675688,Pikeslayer,2012-03-13 17:48:00,1443," Top Secret :ninja: If I told you, I'd have to make you drink Scotch."
675704,whiskywizard,2012-03-13 18:17:00,305,  Hmmm - that doesn't sound all that bad.
675722,Pikeslayer,2012-03-13 18:45:00,1443, Meant to say really bad scotch. Really really bad.
675726,Bob,2012-03-13 18:50:00,370,No such thing as bad scotch. Just some better than others.
675778,Jer,2012-03-13 20:43:00,1426,"It's all ice in front of me on Upper Buckhorn, real punky ice though. I can see open water stretching right across from the direction of Gannons Narrows all the way to Emerald Isle. When I drove across the narrows yesterday afternoon it was pretty well open both directions as far as you could see. This afternoon I came across the Pigeon River by Emily Park and that was all open as well.  The water level is starting to come up a bit, but still at least a foot or two below summer level.  My buddy was saying he came by Scugog through Cesarea today and there was more open water than ice.  I may have to get the boat on the driveway this weekend and get it ready."
675804,irishfield,2012-03-13 22:16:00,26272,Pool is still solid.. yard is not.. buried the truck to the axle getting my 34' float trailer out today.
675923,limeyangler,2012-03-14 01:38:00,5204,"  I'm guessing you have never been to Japan...really, really, really bad scotch....lol"
675933,Basskicker,2012-03-14 01:53:00,421,"Just got back in from a nearby lake...8"" of snow on the lake still...over 30"" of good black ice, probably 3-4 feet of snow on the trail!!!  Going to be ice fishing for a while yet  Jason"
676060,panners,2012-03-14 14:24:00,7,Buckhorn out from theona park to Gannons should be open by Friday the way things are melting.
676063,whiskywizard,2012-03-14 14:32:00,305,"  I've tried that stuff. You're right; really, really bad stuff!  But it's called single malt whisky, not Scotch. To be Scotch it has to be distilled from barley, in Scotland, and aged in an oak cask for at least 3 years, in Scotland.  Sorry for taking us off-topic, but I had to speak up"
676065,jedimaster,2012-03-14 14:39:00,3472,There is no reason to appologize for talking about booze on any fishing thread.
676126,Bob,2012-03-14 18:14:00,370,"Yeah, I'd be guessing really bad scotch wouldn't be coming from Scotland.  On topic: the only open water we have here is in the creeks and rivers. Lakes are still solid with some snow cover. With the long range forecast I'm looking at, it won't be too long."
