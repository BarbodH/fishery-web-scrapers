680169,fishnsled,2012-03-26 14:56:00,3520,"One safe and hopefully happy pooch Joey. Ya, pretty darn cute as well."
680180,COUNTRYBOY,2012-03-26 15:26:00,130,  NICE DOG...LOOKS LIKE HE/SHE HAS EARS OF A DINDO BUT CUTE
680240,esoxansteel,2012-03-26 18:03:00,1307,"Leave out the chartrese and youll be fine, dog looks rather sporty  "
680243,esoxansteel,2012-03-26 18:08:00,1307,  Thats cause hes trying to hear what Joey and Paul are saying about him behind his back
680245,Terry,2012-03-26 18:16:00,14456,"I think she is worried about line twist, I noticed the snap swivel on the line   LOL"
680251,davey buoy,2012-03-26 18:52:00,5505,"Hey Joey,looks great .I wish i could take my dog out but she's too big,but sinks like a stone in the water.Better if she just stays home,also thinking of a smaller dog down that loooooooooong road. Would be a great fishing pal"
680252,Handlebarz,2012-03-26 19:01:00,3790,Black and orange??? Will he be joining us this fall just wondering
680259,Spiel,2012-03-26 19:24:00,9065,A few miss placed shots of chartreuse paint and a few over sized trebles and we'll definitely have something to talk about.
680309,OhioFisherman,2012-03-26 21:40:00,6623," Joey, I have a Boston, LOL I wonder how authentic the breeders are when it comes to their papers? He looks more like the French Bulldog in the picture, and tipping the scales at 30 pounds makes him very big for a Boston?  Mine turns 6 this year, and has always had the massive chest. The 4th er... Boston with papers our family had owned, 2 the traditional black and white with brindle, an all brindled one, and Bandit is white and seal. Bandit and the all brindled one both had big chests, Bandit`s is far larger though, the all brindled one weighed in at 25 pounds, and the black and whites at right around 20 pounds.  Great dogs, my kids and grandkids love them."
680331,Joey,2012-03-26 22:29:00,9122, You bet he will Mike
680332,Joey,2012-03-26 22:30:00,9122," Do yours have the pointy or the bat ears?  Great dogs nevertheless, and they are great with kids and other dogs.  Actually, they lover everybody"
680351,outllaw,2012-03-26 23:14:00,1232,joey. now i stopped chuckling heres an offer.orange is a good base. we can airbrush the jacket for free. the dog itself we can dye to match. if your going to troll her get good ear and nose plugs
680355,Christopheraaron,2012-03-26 23:17:00,3525,"Don't look in the eyes, TOO CUTE!"
680383,OhioFisherman,2012-03-26 23:45:00,6623," Actually Joey somewhat of a mix of the two, not as pointy as the Boston and not as batty as the French. His back legs are longer than his front legs, which gives him an angle. The first one we got after I retired and had time to spend with him, so he knows all the rules. My property is bordered in trees, he will chase a rabbit to them, but rarely goes a step or two beyond them. He will follow me halfway down the drive when I get the mail and stop and wait for me to return.  If I am doing something outside, which isn`t much anymore he will park himself under a shade tree and wait to see if I am going to play with him. Bostons and French Bulldogs don`t handle heat real well. Never leave one chained up or confined outside with out shade or water."
679927,Joey,2012-03-25 21:25:00,9122,Getting ready for his first year of boating season.  Can't wait!!!!!!!!    
679931,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 21:33:00,8333,Don't let Lew see that.
679933,Rod Caster,2012-03-25 21:40:00,5784,"haha cool, actually looks comfy for the little guy."
679934,lew,2012-03-25 21:41:00,12766, Too late Rob and I think three 7/0 trebles would work just fine  The little guy gets cuter everyday Joey
679936,misfish,2012-03-25 21:43:00,29133,"Is that a ""TACO"" shell?  We seen a rauf here today. Got me thinking. Nice little dogs."
679938,mercman,2012-03-25 21:47:00,7054,What size did you get Joey? Would that fit a Pomeranian?
679942,Joey,2012-03-25 22:02:00,9122," I got a small Mercman, says 15 to 25 lbs and since this breed it not supposed to get bigger than 25 lbs, I figured it would fit!  I would say it would fit a Pomeanian for sure!"
679943,aplumma,2012-03-25 22:08:00,6896,Doggie Bobber??   Art
679945,206,2012-03-25 22:09:00,563,"Great idea, these little guys get real hot out on the water and a quick dip is generally called for....the handle is perfect to get them back onboard   "
679946,Raf,2012-03-25 22:10:00,3495,"Where did you get the lifejacket Joey.  Our spaniel jumped into the pond and taught himself to swim today even with all the panic  :D .  I think they are more water dogs but, I'd still like to get him one for the boat though"
679949,Joey,2012-03-25 22:12:00,9122," I got it at Petsmart Raf, $22.00."
679951,asdve23rveavwa,2012-03-25 22:21:00,2690,Awwwwwwwwwwwww...too cute.
679984,Sinker,2012-03-25 23:15:00,8692,"Black and orange.....the only colour you need for musky!!  Looks like he's gonna be safe as can be, Joey!  I can't find a vest large enough for my dog. He doesn't like wearing them anyways....he's a pretty good swimmer though!  S."
679995,Joey,2012-03-25 23:31:00,9122," Well French Bulldog's are not known for their swimming abilities, so I figured this was the best plan.  If he learns to swim without it, all the better.  Petsmart had some pretty big ones if you want to look there!"
680028,NAW,2012-03-26 00:32:00,4022,Does he like wearing it?  Some dogs freeze up when you put a jacket on them.  Not mine.  She loves it!
680049,bigugli,2012-03-26 01:27:00,6138,"Petsmart has Xsmall jackets for toys up to 10 lbs. Small dogs may swim, but won't last for long if they fall out of the boat. No different than having a small child in a boat."
680050,bigugli,2012-03-26 01:28:00,6138,He's a cute little fella.
680099,motv8tr,2012-03-26 06:16:00,2587,"he sure is a cutie Joey, I hope he likes the boat....I'm not likely to find one big enough for my guy, he's weighing in at 175lbs and still growing...think I'll leave him home when I go fishing  Maureen"
680104,wormdunker,2012-03-26 10:24:00,1711,"Nice pix, thanx for sharing.  Caution, when out in the boat be aware of snapping turtles if U should let him go for a swim."
680118,OhioFisherman,2012-03-26 12:07:00,6623," French Bulldog? It looks more like a Boston Terrier. Mine tried walking across the solar cover on the swimming pool once, needless to say that didn`t go well for him."
680121,FishHeadRic,2012-03-26 12:11:00,226,Very Cute Joey!   FHR
680125,Joey,2012-03-26 12:35:00,9122,"  In the picture is a French Bulldog Licking a Boston Terrier.  The French Bulldog is stockier and has round bat ears, the Boston Terrier has longer legs and pointy ears.  Ralphie is just a puppy still so is not stocky yet, but has the bat ears and is starting to stock up in the chest.  "
680146,GBW,2012-03-26 13:54:00,8460,#80 test should work great with him!
680149,jedimaster,2012-03-26 14:01:00,3472,"Are you trolling for sharks? What pound test is that line? Very nice detail on that lure, looks alomst like a real dog."
