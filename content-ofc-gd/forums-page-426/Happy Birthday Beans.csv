679907,Beans,2012-03-25 20:18:00,3339," Hey Steve...I'm getting old enough to receive two pensions (76)...  No blackflies yet or skeeters...  Big Cliff and your fat little buddy (CPH) are terrorizing Sturgeon Lake while Meely and Buckster, Zen and I wetted our lines in Lake X...  I go by the saying...""if Tony ain't catchin' any, They're not in yet""...just like the carp in Peterpatch...'nuff said..."
