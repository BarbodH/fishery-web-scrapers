680573,Gerritt,2012-03-27 16:00:00,6129,Never even heard of them
680603,sneak_e_pete,2012-03-27 17:12:00,540,Spelled it wrong.... fincraft.... Made by Larson
680612,Fang,2012-03-27 17:31:00,1330,"saw the FX1750 at the spring fishing show and was highly impresses with the build, layout and design. The price was pretty awesome too at $23K boat, motor (115 HP) and custom trailer  Only thing left to do would be a water test"
680624,sneak_e_pete,2012-03-27 18:09:00,540,Is Larson a decent brand?
680626,bigbuck,2012-03-27 18:11:00,2449,"They look real nice. Nice layout and features. I have an older Larson Fish'N'Ski and can attest to the ride quality of the VEC hull, nice dry ride. The build quality is pretty good too. No wood in the hull to rot and have to replace."
