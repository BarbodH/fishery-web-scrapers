679727,Canuck,2012-03-25 13:21:00,491,"We did a half day charter in Florida out of St Pete's Went 4 for 10 on pretty crazy kingfish action.  Interesting fishing technique.  Jig 6 tiny hook sabiki rigs for baitfish (10 inch cigar minnows and sardines were the best), then hook them on pretty small circle hooks and let the line out behind the boat and drift and troll slowly around while you wait for the reel to scream. The fight is pretty close to King salmon. The charter captain prefers a very light drag which is why the rod does not bend much on the runs in the video (that and the fact that that rod was a pretty stiff saltwater rig.  Others he had were lighter and closer to our great lakes DR rods).  In this video we are near the end of the fight so you don't see the screaming reel part unfortunately.

679886,Canuck,2012-03-25 19:32:00,491," That's actually my daughter (a bit of a tom boy and one of the musicians in the music track) and she's holding an underwater camera on a long mount, not a gaff, and filming underwater. (its an Oregon Scientific ATC9K I have posted about here before - neat little camera).  I may splice in some of that footage later.  She was not aiming the camera that well so only caught a couple of shots of the actual fish.  Mostly just blue water and shots of the bottom of the boat in the underwater video."

679932,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 21:38:00,8333, I realized it was a camera once she pulled it out of the water. Maybe she would get better shots if she had more practice.   Meaning dad needs to catch more fish.
680016,Christopheraaron,2012-03-26 00:00:00,3525,"Nice fish, my trip down to mexico is coming up and I can't wait! Good on you for C&R."
680040,Rizzo,2012-03-26 00:52:00,4754,Nice King! I used to do quite a bit of deep sea fishing a few years back. Some days all you get is the head of those kingfish on the line because a big barracuda bites em clean through as you're reeling it in.
680089,Canuck,2012-03-26 03:23:00,491," Ha!  Actually she got two of them herself, I got one, and the big one is the on my bro got.  I did get more bait than the others though, for what that's worth!"
