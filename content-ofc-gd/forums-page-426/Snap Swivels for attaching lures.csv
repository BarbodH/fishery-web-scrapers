678980,mercman,2012-03-23 20:57:00,7054,"Ok Boyz !!!!!  Thanks for all your help. Biggest problem for us New Anglers is trying what everyone says to try.I will try all ov your ideas at least once for sure.  I like Danbobs best  ''Never use snaps or swivels. Even on spinner baits with no loop. I just have a rod for every technique, less tying ''  Now i better start looking for a new place to live"
678993,GBW,2012-03-23 21:24:00,8460,you my fishing friend WIN!  please take me fishing...  lol
679015,kickingfrog,2012-03-23 22:17:00,8333,Shrink wrap tubing works great on R bends.
679038,Sinker,2012-03-23 22:47:00,8692,"I use snaps, and I use inline swivels, but the only time I use snap-swivels is for great lakes trolling. I hate them, and I guarantee you will catch more fish without those ugly things on your line.  I use just a snap for jigging spoons, or crankbaits. Pretty much everything else is tied direct, unless I'm using a heavy leader for musky.  Try using an inline swivel to tie your leader from braid, then a snap on the fluoro/mono end for clipping on your lure. In some cases it will improve the action of your baits.  Make sure when you add the swivel between braid/fluoro you don't make it too long. There is nothing worse for your rod tip than casting an inline swivel thru it all day long. It will crack the tip eye for sure, over time.   S."
679039,Christopheraaron,2012-03-23 22:51:00,3525,"I don't use them at all, but I'm always nervous that one of my knots will slip when I have a fish on no matter how secure the knot seems."
679041,davey buoy,2012-03-23 22:54:00,5505," Don't you still have to tie a knot to your hook?,what's the diff?"
679048,Christopheraaron,2012-03-23 23:01:00,3525,What do you mean?
679051,davey buoy,2012-03-23 23:06:00,5505," A good knot is a good knot whether you tie one,two or three knots,I'll grant you the less knots the better."
679052,BillM,2012-03-23 23:06:00,17367, He's saying you're tying a knot regardless.  Whether it's to a snap or a hook it really doesn't matter
679077,Christopheraaron,2012-03-23 23:50:00,3525,"I know that, I'm just afraid that I'm not good at tying knots, which I am."
679092,captpierre,2012-03-24 00:23:00,2521,I'll never forget my Dad losing a monster musky on a large stickbait because his brass swivel opened up.  I use a swivel most of the time but always use one that has a little 90 degree bend on the end that snaps in.
679180,BillM,2012-03-24 04:01:00,17367," Practice, practice, practice.."
679223,solopaddler,2012-03-24 11:51:00,8605,"  Did anyone notice this response? Shane beat me to it.  If using braid (which seems to be the trend these days) consider using a tiny 2-way ""ant"" swivel to connect braid and fluoro leader.  At the end of your fluoro leader tie on the smallest cross lock snap you can get away with.  The cross lock snap WILL NOT hamper the lures action and the tiny inline swivel will elininate line twist if using spinners.  This combination has saved me a TON of money as well. Small two way swivels and cross lock snaps are super strong and waaay cheaper than buying a bunch of expensive ball bearing snap swivels. Have you seen how much the quality snap swivels go for? It's ridiculous."
679271,Sinker,2012-03-24 13:52:00,8692,"  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that part!  Option A:  A pack of 20 snaps.....1.99 A pack of 100 sivels...3.99  Option B:  A pack of 5 snap swivels....6.99.....  Way cheaper, and more effective with option A.  S."
679332,Beans,2012-03-24 16:14:00,3339," I tend to use the smallest swivel I can use safely on my main line (palomar), then tie with a lighter lb test fluorocarbon leader (palomar) on the other side of the swivel, then tie directly to my jig or spinner or make the leader into a carp hair rig then tie to the other end of swivel...except when using 4 lb test Berkley for panfish, then I use the same line below the swivel...  I have been known to use the Berkly # 1 snaps for most pickerel and bass lures except when trolling for musky, then it is mostly an eight inch wire leader...   "
679434,Joeytier,2012-03-24 20:27:00,3990,"I don't use braid, and will always tie direct unless I'm specifically esox fishing.  I'm also not the type to fly through my whole tackle box in a days fishing."
679446,Leecher,2012-03-24 20:51:00,7832, You read my mind Joey    cause that's exactly what I do... Snap swivel is only used when I target the bottom of the water column
679451,Fisherman,2012-03-24 21:04:00,7201,"All I can add is that if you do use them, don't go with the cheap barrel swivels, get the bearing type.  They turn much smoother unlike barrel swivels which under stress can lock in place and then twist. Brands like Sampo or Spro are probably the best. As for the other end, coastlock, crosslock or duo lock are all fine wit me.  For those that are a little visually impaired, the ""No knot fast snaps"" are great for attaching small hooks."
679454,Leecher,2012-03-24 21:14:00,7832," Edit:  I should of explained myself in more details.... here we go      I never use braid on my softwater gear, only mono and tie direct to the lures unless I'm targeting trout, where a snap swivel comes in handy for a slip bobber type rig  On hard water, I use braid and a barrel swivel between a mono leader to cut down on line twist since I'm fishing with a vertical presentation   It's also true for softwater jigging"
679463,singingdog,2012-03-24 21:39:00,1047,I can see using a snap if you aren't good with knots. I definitely don't use a snap-swivel unless I am using an inline spinner or a spoon. A snap-swivel will often cause lures like cranks and jerkbaits to run untrue.

680318,Billy Bob,2012-03-26 21:56:00,5865,"Each and every fishing presentation dictates what kind of knot and if there is any snap swivel or snap involved.  I do a LOT of jig fishing so most times I tie my jig on using a Rapala loop knot. This allows that jig the most action while I finesse it into the fishy's mouth....LOL  For casting or trolling stick baits like Rapala's, especially at night I like to use a Berkeley Cross Lok Snap...... If a snap swivel is required to reduce line twist then I use a Cabela's Ball Bearing Cross Lock Snap....  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishing/Terminal-Tackle/Swivels-Snaps-Clevises%7C/pc/104793480/c/104779980/sc/104616180/Cabelas-Deluxe-Ball-Bearing-Cross-Lock-Snaps-150-Nickel/738685.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse.cmd%3FN%3D1100372%26WTz_l%3DSBC%253Bcat104793480%253Bcat104779980&WTz_l=SBC%3Bcat104793480%3Bcat104779980%3Bcat104616180  Yes they cost more but the do the job....  For all other terminal direct tie ups I employ a double improved clinch knot that I can tie with my eyes closed....(good thing as I can no longer see the line....  )"
678865,mercman,2012-03-23 17:18:00,7054,"Knots All kinds of them I have to admit, i can tie them in the comfort of my home while getting ready to go fishing.It may take a couple of minutes to get right, but i can do it. But on the water, i always use really good quality snap swivels. Some have told me that this negatively affects lure action, and suggest i am an amateur(which i am,just dont like hearing it ) I always choose the smallest i can get away with for the type of fishing i am doing at the time. What are the thoughts of my fellow OFCers on Snap Swivels versus tie direct?  Thanks guys   "
678871,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 17:27:00,4661,depends on your fishing technique i would think...  i use these for cranks... and i love em...  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Fishing/Terminal-Tackle/Swivels-Snaps-Clevises|/pc/104793480/c/104779980/sc/104616180/Cabelas-Premium-Duolock-Snaps-Black/702222.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Ffishing-terminal-tackle-swivels-snaps-clevises%2F_%2FN-1100372%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_104616180%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253Bcat104793480%253Bcat104779980&WTz_l=SBC%3Bcat104793480%3Bcat104779980%3Bcat104616180
678873,Live2fish85,2012-03-23 17:34:00,1633,It all depends on what you are using. I don't use them for most of my lures but there is times where I do.
678874,kickingfrog,2012-03-23 17:40:00,8333,"All depends on your comfort level, technique and lure. Light lures with a delicate action have less tolerance for snaps or snap swivels. Just don't cheap out. Why lose a $10 lure trying to save a buck on a package of snaps."
678876,mercman,2012-03-23 17:46:00,7054,"thanks!!  The only time i tie direct is when i am fishing plastics for Bass.I like to fish them Texas rigged.I can change the bait, without changeing the hook.  "
678883,adempsey,2012-03-23 17:56:00,1498,"I mostly use swivels.  I have no idea if it impacts the action of the lure or not, but I still catch fish.  Maybe I would do better without them, who knows?  I'd probably tie directly [to stickbaits at least] if I didn't switch lures so often and wasn't so lazy about it  :   However, I would love to see some underwater video showing the difference in action on various lures to see if using a swivel makes a difference in lure action; or using different knots like the Rapala versus the Clinch.  Anyone have an empty long aquarium and a video camera???  Many lures come with O-rings and snaplocks pre-attached as well......"
678885,davey buoy,2012-03-23 17:56:00,5505,"I use them all the time,the swivel prevents line twist,I know I should use a two inch leader for pike,but the kinks in a wire leader sometimes turn me off.Also the swivel makes it really easy to change lures.There is a saying you pay your money,you take your chances,and the chances is what I take. Very seldom loose a lure but I use braid all the time and cut and re-tie when needed."
678886,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 17:58:00,4661,also in situations that require really heavey leaders or metal leaders...... like musky fishing... its easier to have a snap on one end and a swivel on the other instead of trying to tie a blood knot from your 100lb braid to your 100lb floro... then try tying a knot to you lure with 100lb floro...  snaps and swivels are way easier...
678892,davey buoy,2012-03-23 18:02:00,5505, Mike and you know this how??:rofl2:
678894,Harrison,2012-03-23 18:02:00,2202,"Depends on the baits Mercman.  I do not use snaps except when big water trolling(riggers, planers etc.)  I use a trilene knot for baits I use that work better not tied direct, ie. jerkbaits  Little practice tying some of the knots and you can get very quick at it!"
678896,Rod Caster,2012-03-23 18:04:00,5784,"I use 'em all the time unless I'm using a single hook, like when live baiting, drop shotting, wacky rigging etc. It's makes life that much easier when your changing setups. Unless your a pro, then feel free to complicate your life  Try these..SUPER cheap in bulk and they are very stealthy. I buy the cheap swivel to go along with them... if I'm more concerned with twisting or breaking, I use the ball bearing swivels. http://www.luremaking.com/catalogue/catalogue-index/catalogue-items/duolock_snaps.htm"
678900,mercman,2012-03-23 18:21:00,7054,"I'm also trying something new on one of my setups.A tip from a well seasoned Angler i know. Instead of uni-uni for attaching my leader to my braid.I am using a number 10(i believe) Mustad chain swivel.Its rated for 30+ lbs, and is small enough to slide through the guides easily if necessary.I will try and remember to let you all know how it works out."
678901,Live2fish85,2012-03-23 18:22:00,1633,I really only use them for casting spoons for trout and salmon.  After reading Harrisons post I am going to start using them trolling Ontario.  If you don't have problems using them Paul then use them. Who cares if people call you a amatuer. You catch fish.
678905,davey buoy,2012-03-23 18:26:00,5505, I use them for float fishing.Very strong swivel!
678906,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 18:27:00,4661,     experimentation...    
678909,OhioFisherman,2012-03-23 18:38:00,6623,"I rarely used a swivel snap, but used just snaps often. Swivels snaps are great for lures that may cause line twist, like in line spinner baits. I liked to use snaps that would test out at twice the weight of any fish I was likely to hook.  I always used a snap with a crank bait."
678934,NANUK,2012-03-23 19:38:00,797,"I use snap swivels all the time when fishing with lures like crank baits and spoons, I think in all my fishing life I had a problem with just once when a snap broke on me, that is pretty good for 30+ years compare to knots IMO. I even use the them on tiny cranks/spinners for trout & steelhead. Make sure you buy quality brand name duo lock or coast lock ball bearing swivels."
678935,BillM,2012-03-23 19:39:00,17367,"I like crosslocks.  Anytime I'm using a crank, jerkbait, spinnerbait, spinner, whatever I'll use a swivel."
678937,davey buoy,2012-03-23 19:43:00,5505,"Unless your still fishing,in my opinion you must have at least a swivel/snap swivel."
678942,mike rousseau,2012-03-23 19:53:00,4661,  unless you use one of the many spinnerbaits that have a twist at the eye forming a complete loop...
678945,BillM,2012-03-23 19:56:00,17367, A piece of rubber tubing over the notch of the spinnerbait will stop the swivel from going down the wire arm.  I think they mentioned this little trick on OOD recently as well.  I've been doing it for a few years..  Works awesome.
678946,mercman,2012-03-23 19:57:00,7054," Try this Sinclair.  Go to CT or any big hardware and buy the smallest ''O'' ring you can find.I have found them as small as 1/8 inch inside dia. Slide one over the loop in the spinner bait, then attach your snap to the exposed loop.You can usually get about 20 for a couple of bucks.  The ''O''ring will not affect the spinning of the blades or lur action at all. eddited to say.................... BillM beat me to it LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Same idea."
678949,Dan668,2012-03-23 19:58:00,1120,"Never use snaps or swivels. Even on spinner baits with no loop. I just have a rod for every technique, less tying"
678953,davey buoy,2012-03-23 20:05:00,5505," Even if they don't I can go 10 casts or more before I have to slide it back into position that one time,not a big deal IMO."
678977,davey buoy,2012-03-23 20:51:00,5505," Sinclair,with a swivel on a closed loop,I haven't seen that myself,or so seldom I don't remember it happening."
