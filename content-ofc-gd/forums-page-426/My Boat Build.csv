680440,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 02:00:00,4661,  Yup... Fits 3 no problem....  Unless everyone is 300lbs...  Perks of a tiller... Lots of room...
680444,mike rousseau,2012-03-27 02:02:00,4661, Not sure...  But my 5.4 liter F-150 hardly knows its back there...  I know guys that tow similar boats with 6 cyl cars no problem....
679349,Steve,2012-03-24 16:57:00,2075,"As mentioned earlier in January, I decided to get my boat restored rather than purchasing a new hull. Trailer and motor were ok.  Boats these days have lost all their ""fishability"". By installing ""through floor"" rod storage (for max 7' rods) they have reduced the space needed for full size livewells. Notice these days boats have two small ones, rather than one good one. Fishing for fish larger than 22"" requires a livewell much larger than found on todays boats.  My casting deck is also half the size of my boat....boats today have much smaller casting decks.  For these two main reasons is why I decided to get my boat restored, rather than buying new.  I decided on Ron Banks Marine service to do the job (after TONS of positive comments from folks who either know their work, or have had work done themselves). I was warned about his pricing - yep, it's expensive....but done correctly - the first time!  Replaced was 140 rivets, flooring (changing the lund 3/5"" non marine ply to 3/4"" marine ply). Also all carpet.  My ""upgrades"" were my electronics command centre, rigger mounts, and front trolling motor mount.  The price slowly escalated after each visit when I requested more and more upgrades....but it was all worth it in the end!    The Drop Off                Visit I  On my first visit I saw basically a stripped boat, with the 140 rivets changed and completed. All else was simply stripped. All stringers were in tact. Ron commented that my boat had ""double supports"" compared to lunds of today. My boat was a 1998 Lund Pro Guide CANADIAN EDITION. These were sent to lodges in the north under lease arrangements. My boat was sent to a lodge that quickly went under, so it didn't get much use. The reason I cannot find another one of my boats (i've never seen another in my life - internet, or on the water) is cause most of them were destroyed by heavy resort use.                               Visit II  My second visit was to see it at about 60% completion. The rigger mounts were done, as was most of the electronics. The supports under the floor boards for the seats are second to none. Lund had tiny tin squares cut out for the bolts to go through. Not any more! Its actually embarrasing to see the short cuts taken on factory boat manufacturing.....and this is a lund - can you imagine the short cuts on lesser quality boats.... Boat manufacture's definitely follow the ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality.                            All Finished  The finished product was amazing.                               Oh, and our first outing Thursday evening for the water test.  "
679358,mercman,2012-03-24 17:12:00,7054,"Awesome job, and i bet you saved a bunch compared to a new boat.A few pics didn tload, but i saw enough t know you made the right decission.  Enjoy !   Paul"
679365,Steve,2012-03-24 17:24:00,2075,"i'm not sure about the savings.  i'm about 60% into a new hull.  (the 2012 lund pro guide 1600 HULL ONLY is almost 15K - and this boat is now far superior to that boat. Oh, and my boat is a 1700 model...)"
679369,lew,2012-03-24 17:27:00,12766,Looks like they did an excellent restoration Steve.  Very nice work !!
679377,davey buoy,2012-03-24 17:42:00,5505,"Great job,and now following all the work that was done,it's almost like brand new to you.At least you now know the overall condition of the boat!."
679383,Wolf 3,2012-03-24 18:14:00,134,"Looks great. ""Brand-new"" is not always better..."
679388,Grimace,2012-03-24 18:24:00,2020,Great boat and a great Brown.  Does it get any better?
679389,livinisfishin,2012-03-24 18:31:00,661,Great job! Well worth the money spent!
679390,glirw,2012-03-24 18:36:00,200,"wow , boat porn at its finest. looks amazing."
679427,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-24 20:13:00,4399,"nice work that rig looked in pretty rough shape for a 98!, I hope the refurbished rig will have a cover or garage!"
679430,Steve,2012-03-24 20:20:00,2075," Well, it has a garage...  but it spends most of its time on the water...and it certainly has no cover there...  the biggest issue is towing in the winter....fishing in the winter....hell, the winter in general."
680131,Headhunter,2012-03-26 13:01:00,5703,Looks like it will provide you with quite a few more winters to come Steve.... congrats! HH
680152,ccmtcanada,2012-03-26 14:16:00,7971,Looks fantastic!!!
680157,NAW,2012-03-26 14:26:00,4022,Nice job on the re-furb.  You might consider a customer cover that you can put on while trailoring in the winter?
680164,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-26 14:41:00,10439,"Yeah, I would get a custom trailering cover for it. Especially since you are dragging it around in the winter with all the salt they throw around down there."
680165,mike rousseau,2012-03-26 14:42:00,4661,your boat basically looks the exact same as mine...just a few small differences... but overall really close...(for anyone trying to find a boat like this)  but i was lucky...this is the condition i bought mine in...  mines a 1997 lund explorer 1600  looks identicle to me...  great report....      
680166,SlowPoke,2012-03-26 14:43:00,2984," I know the feeling. I refurb'ed my 18'er, fully gutted with new foam and added aluminium bracing with an aluminium floor/vinyl. It's better than new but doesn't have the shine. It's a shame that I did all that work only to be selling it now but at least I know it was done right and will never need doing again. At least you were wise enough to pay someone else; I missed a LOT of fishing time doing it myself. It looks great and you will enjoy it for many more years."
680167,fishnsled,2012-03-26 14:44:00,3520,"Looks amazing!  Well worth the money spent I'd say, especially since you can't replace it with something you'll be happy with.	Cool to see the process of the work being done.   Enjoy the ""new"" ride Steve and thanks for the report."
680168,mike rousseau,2012-03-26 14:55:00,4661,whats the ballpark cost for a job like this...  pm me if you dont want to make it public...  but i think a lot would like to know the cost of fixing up older used boats..
680192,SlowPoke,2012-03-26 15:50:00,2984, Those that have done it are trying to forget how much they spent!
680213,Steve,2012-03-26 16:58:00,2075,"Biggest difference between the explorer and the pro guide is the transom width (pro guide an extra 3"") and the casting deck length.  Pro Guide casting deck length almost 30"" longer.  Of course, I'm comparing the 1700 explorer with the 1700 pro guide.  I'm not sure what your max hp is on the 1600, but the 1700's were the same at 60hp.   By the looks of your 1600, I'm not sure where the livewell is?  The 1700 Pro Guide, (I cannot remember the 1700 explorer) has the center livewell at 28 gallons.  Other than for the above, VERY CLOSE. And yes, yours is in great condition!"
680219,mike rousseau,2012-03-26 17:14:00,4661,  livewell is beside my electronic controlls on the back left...third pic on the left you can see the livewell cover...under my sonar head unit...i think you have a baitwell there by the looks of it... mine is 36 inch well there instead... and where your big well is i have storage...  max hp is 45 for my boat...  and yes... my front deck is pretty small... but i prefer that and my extra floor space... some days i wish the deck was bigger... but most days im happy with what i got...
680231,Steve,2012-03-26 17:35:00,2075,"Mike, I've seen your success. I'd say you do quite well in that rig.  They are great multi species boats!  Do you guide out of that boat?"
680272,kickingfrog,2012-03-26 19:42:00,8333,Hey Steve and Musky Mike: What is the approximate towing weight of those outfits?
680302,Steve,2012-03-26 21:07:00,2075, 1998 Lund Pro Guide 1700 Canadian Edition hull weight: 676lbs 50hp Yamaha motor weight: 247lbs I run 3 12v batteries as well (add another 220lbs)  1997 Lund Explorer 1600 hull weight: 615lbs 45hp Honda motor weight: 214lbs
