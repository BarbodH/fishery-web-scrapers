680337,Christopheraaron,2012-03-26 22:45:00,3525,"I'm looking for a good quality vice under $100, I'm not looking for anything super special I've been using a AA vice for a few years and I can't stand it, half the time the hook slips out when you tying and it is impossible to tighten, any suggestions?"
680342,ChrisK,2012-03-26 22:52:00,2772,I use an Apex and a Integra. Both are good vise's.
680343,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-26 22:53:00,10439,"I don't know about under $100 but I am now using a Renzeti Traveler and it is a sweet vise. The jaws grip like crazy and it's a rotary. Unfortunately it is double what you're looknig to spend, but if you can swing the extra $$$$ you won't be sorry.  I'm sure you will get plenty of responses of vises in your price bracket."
680347,Christopheraaron,2012-03-26 23:00:00,3525," Thanks Chrisk (That's my name too) both vices look good, I'm gonna wait and see what other recommendations come in."
680365,walleye wanderer,2012-03-26 23:26:00,64, I was giving a vise some consideration and found this site in my travelsâ€¦pretty good read I think. http://www.flyfishohio.com/Vise%20Review%201/Fly_Tying_Vise_Shoot-Out.htm
