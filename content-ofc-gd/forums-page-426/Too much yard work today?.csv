679920,Joey,2012-03-25 20:55:00,9122,Had to take these shots.  Paul and Ralphie were out front all day doing yard work and getting the boat ready for the season.  I didn't hear any more noise for quite some time and had to investigate.  This is what I saw

679922,Handlebarz,2012-03-25 21:00:00,3790,Looks like me last week at least I made it to bed. I hope to get the boat ready next week or so. What a start to spring
