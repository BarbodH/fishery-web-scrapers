679272,ehg,2012-03-24 13:53:00,2666,Fairly constant stream of walleye. Saw a smallmouth and carp go by as well. Kinda like scuba diving there.
679283,Christopheraaron,2012-03-24 14:14:00,3525, i just saw your carp.
679294,Muskieman,2012-03-24 14:45:00,2472,A very deformed tumorous Walleye was about yesterday ... Looked like someone glued a whole whack of gum balls to him....
679305,Nipfisher,2012-03-24 15:10:00,2449,I saw a little sunfish (bluegill) this morning.

679876,ehg,2012-03-25 18:58:00,2666,This river is in Wisconsin and flows into Lake Michigan.  Little murkier and less active today but saw usual walleyes and a pike. A white sucker went slowly along bottom and posed in front of camera for a minute.
680293,Christopheraaron,2012-03-26 20:52:00,3525,Carp  just ran into the camera!
