679340,Rizzo,2012-03-24 16:33:00,4754,"I put my boat/trailer on axle stands the first time this winter. Do you guys do this in the summer as well when the boat won't be used for 3 weeks? 5 weeks? I just pulled my boat back in to the garage, and decided to put it back on the stands. This time I put the stands in a different spot, more towards the back of the boat (through the winter I actually had the axle jacked up). Just dropped the tongue down, put the stands in place towards the back of the trailer, and cranked the tongue back up (I believe Wayne had suggested this method last fall). Also noticed a lot of weight up at the tongue, so I built a tower of 2x4's and other scraps and rested the tongue on that (guess I need to buy another axle stand!)"
679343,davey buoy,2012-03-24 16:41:00,5505," Great to have the weight of the boat off the springs and tires for the winter,but for a couple weeks to a month ,I'd have to say I wouldn't bother."
679347,Sinker,2012-03-24 16:48:00,8692,"I've never jacked my trailer off the ground. It doesn't sit long enough. I've had mine out at least once every month so far this year, and from here on out it will be at least twice a week  S."
679348,mercman,2012-03-24 16:49:00,7054,I put mine on jacks last fall too. I can't see the boat sitting 3-5 weeks in the summer though That would be unforgiveable
679351,lew,2012-03-24 16:58:00,12766,"Mines jacked up in the winter months too Roger.  Wooden blocks front & back      And jack stands in the middle    I've done it for years and figure it's a good way to take the weight off the tires, springs and whatever else. Don't know if it's really necessary or not but it can't hurt.  I also undo the rear tie down straps and the bow winch strap."
679354,Tybo,2012-03-24 17:03:00,1373,"To sit for 5 weeks,you`ll get flat spots on the tires.They should go away once they get some heat into them. One thing.Make sure you`re tire are at the right pressure."
679391,Rizzo,2012-03-24 18:53:00,4754," I hear you! Now if we can convince my wife  Lew, that looks like what I've done...tower of miscellaneous wood pieces! Your trailer looks MUCH nicer than mine though."
679744,Tybo,2012-03-25 14:13:00,1373,One thing I notice a few years back.That the chemicals in the pressure treat wood ate at the paint on the trailer.
679745,lew,2012-03-25 14:17:00,12766," Never heard of that before Paul, but I'll find out in a couple weeks when I remove them.  I'll let you know."
679755,Tybo,2012-03-25 14:33:00,1373,"Lew,That was on the tracker trailer.So might of be bad paint.Since then I don`t but the pressure treated against it."
679760,lew,2012-03-25 14:40:00,12766,This is the 1st year I ever used the pressure treated Paul but I had an extra 6 x 6 here doing nothing and figured it'd be good. If it did any damage I'll fix up the paint and use regualr wood next year.  Thanks for the heads-up.
679795,Billy Bob,2012-03-25 15:56:00,5865,"I have the same boat, motor and trailer for the last 27 years now....never had it up on jack stands.......tires and springs are fine.....but if you like doing that stuff......go and have fun...."
679820,lew,2012-03-25 16:45:00,12766,"And I'll bet you don't get your hubs wet either, eh Bob ??"
679837,smally21,2012-03-25 17:31:00,993,cant say id bother for 4-5weeks. sometimes its more about the thing not sinking into the ground where it sits than letting the weight off the tires and springs. i use these huge logs i rescued from a tree job and these dont seem to sink in the ground the way the tires would. (yoiu could insert asphalt here i suppose depending on temperature).  lew the rims on your trailer are pimpin'. they just need some spinners in the middle and you'd be blinged right up
679849,lew,2012-03-25 17:56:00,12766," Hey, now there's a thought"
679853,smally21,2012-03-25 18:00:00,993,Think they are the nicest ive seen. And ive seen alot of trailer tires!
679857,Billy Bob,2012-03-25 18:10:00,5865," Lew, the boat has been out 5 times already this year and those hubbies are still bone dry....  ....but the livewell has been very wet with fish aboard...."
679874,archer379,2012-03-25 18:55:00,277,Not sure if the same applies but I was told the worst thing for a suspension in a car is to let it hang for a long time  I have never put up a trailer on jacks. Also on my 24 ft camper your not to jack it off the ground anyplace along the frame as it can bend the frame. I would think that if your boat was big enough and heavy enough that blocking the frame at the back ant then lifting it with the front jack could put unneeded strees on the trailer. Just my option I could be out in left field
680034,smally21,2012-03-26 00:45:00,993,"Not at all. The trailer rails depend on the strength of the boat to provide rigidity. The bunks, thru the cross members, into the trailer rails provide the 'total rigidness' of the assy when loaded. All screwed up when lifted on just a few points. But there is little memory in a minor deflection of the trailer rails and no shock loads (read railroad tracks) during storage so generally no great concern. Something to think about at 34' or something...its a good point"
680069,rob v,2012-03-26 02:08:00,535,so jacking a trailer like this is bad for it ?
680100,GYPSY400,2012-03-26 08:55:00,191,When I put my boat away last season I jacked it up off the ground and supported it from the trailer to let the suspension hang.. Since it was outside I also took the tires off too and brought them inside so the UV rays dont eat them up.
680233,Jer,2012-03-26 17:41:00,1426,"  Funny you mention that. I happened to notice a couple of weeks ago while my boat & trailer was still up on blocks (right at the rear of the trailer) that the boat wasn't resting on the forward portion of the bunks at all, probably floating almost an inch above. I figgered that I would be adjusting the bunks, but of course once the trailer was off the blocks on the driveway, the boat was resting nice and flush.  I had never noticed this much flex in the trailer before, next year I'll be supporting the length of entire trailer a bit better."
