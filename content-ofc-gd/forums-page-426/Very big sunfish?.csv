680392,Garfisher,2012-03-27 00:00:00,229,"That's the genus name of what we call ""sunfish"" (wasn't sure if you were being serious or not)"
680395,bigugli,2012-03-27 00:17:00,6138,"Hybridization of sunfish stocks are a big business in the U.S., so it could also be an hybrid. Even here in Ontario, hybrids of bluegill/pumpkinseed can get quite large."
680475,Acountdeleted,2012-03-27 03:27:00,2562,Time to count the lateral line and caudal scales.  
680489,Billy Bob,2012-03-27 11:40:00,5865,Shellcracker/Bluegill......and a nice one at that...hope he let it go as those genes are hard to replace.
679557,hammercarp,2012-03-25 00:24:00,964,This was caught today by the son of one of the members of our carp club in North Carolina. Any guesses? 
679562,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 00:29:00,8333,"Could be a blue gill. They (""pan fish"") grow a little different down there then up here."
679565,misfish,2012-03-25 00:36:00,29133, Blue/crappie mix?  Huge piggie.
679566,danbouck,2012-03-25 00:37:00,4380,State record is 4lb 5oz there for bluegill
679572,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 00:44:00,8333, Wow! That is huge. A one pounder here would be a real beauty. I gotta find a photo of that.
679578,Garfisher,2012-03-25 00:50:00,229,Im pretty sure that's a giant redear sunfish
679581,Dozer,2012-03-25 00:51:00,896,"Kid makes it look bgger than it actually is, extended arms and all."
679583,Pikeslayer,2012-03-25 00:52:00,1443,Bream.
679585,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 00:55:00,8333, Which is a bluegill no?  btw Ontario record for bluegills is 1 pound 8 ounces.
679586,Pikeslayer,2012-03-25 01:00:00,1443, Not sure but probably? Just know there called bream south of the MDL. And plenty fun to catch.
679592,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 01:04:00,8333,I don't even know if it is a bream/bluegill.   That's what you run into with common/local names for fish. Makes for some fun chats around the campfire.
679598,206,2012-03-25 01:11:00,563,Look like a shellcracker
679606,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 01:21:00,8333, aka redear.  We can be sure it's not a walleye/pickerel.
679640,Christopheraaron,2012-03-25 02:12:00,3525,"Definitely not a bream, probably just a giant bluegill."
679644,danbouck,2012-03-25 02:15:00,4380, you sure?
679650,kickingfrog,2012-03-25 02:26:00,8333," Ok, I can be sure, ""we"" was a mistake."
679654,coreyhkh,2012-03-25 02:27:00,163,wow
679665,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-03-25 02:44:00,310,Nice gill kid.
679668,irishfield,2012-03-25 02:48:00,26272,7 years old?
679686,Garfisher,2012-03-25 04:51:00,229,"Redear Sunfish http://www.outdooralabama.com/fishing/freshwater/fish/bream/redear/angler/ Check out the two being held by Nick Lewis (9th row down), looks exactly the same"
679689,Acountdeleted,2012-03-25 05:09:00,2562,I can already tell you its not a Redear sunfish and its not a pumpkinseed. I'm 99% sure its a bluegill. Best way to identify is that it doesn't have any red or white on the operculum (ear flap) other then counting scales on the lateral line or the caudal that is the best way to tell.
679691,Garfisher,2012-03-25 05:15:00,229,"http://www.tnfish.org/PhotoGalleryFish_TWRA/FishPhotoGallery_TWRA/images/RedearSunfishLoudounNegus_jpg.jpg Opercular tab colour doesnt always work. While redears normally do have a red tab, not all redears have a red tab."
680325,Acountdeleted,2012-03-26 22:06:00,2562,"  Yep, but that one has a white leading edge on it where as on bluegills the white leading edge will be absent....... We took 3rd year fish at Fleming together didn't we? 2007 graduate?"
680344,Garfisher,2012-03-26 22:54:00,229,"2nd year fish here . I've never seen a bluegill coloured like that, and redears can have no/little colour around the opercular (and have the colouration shown). That's why I'm pushing redear. Either way its a very big Lepomis"
680366,Jer,2012-03-26 23:26:00,1426,  Are you allowed to say that in polite company?
