Plan to go tommorrw again subject to my wify approval since she starts to complain the time I stay home. Will take the advantage to go as much as I can before she has enough to tolerate my lack of time to spend with the family or else I have to find a new wife.LOL.

680265,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-03-26 19:34:00,310,Nice dark lookin' crappies dude.
680269,whiskywizard,2012-03-26 19:38:00,305,"Aha - since you posted that on OFC, I have deduced that you caught them in Ontario.  And I can see from the background that it's somewhere close to a road.  That's a good enough clue for me; I'm on my way.   [nice fish. thanks for the report]"
