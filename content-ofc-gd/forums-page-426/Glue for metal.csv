680063,Dabluz,2012-03-26 01:56:00,701,"Big question!  My bowmount electric motor does not work.  I took apart the motor and everything looks ok except for one big thing....2 magnets on one side of the cylinder that houses the brushes and the armature (coil) are loose.  The magnets on the other side are glued in place.  So, instead of buying a new part for about 60 dollars, I have decided that if the company can glue them in, so can I.  Since the motor is apart, I ordered some new brushes, brush springs and a bearing that goes into the brush holder assembly plus 2 new ""O"" rings.  I will start buy buffing the glue off the magnets and buffing the interior of the center unit (cylinder) to give the glue a good hold.  Now the question.  What glue should I buy?  It will be a metal to metal job.  There is not much stress on the magnets but I don't want them to come unglued."
