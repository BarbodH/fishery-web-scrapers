Fished from nogies creek down to the two little islands. Tried all shorelines, marinas, trailer parks. No crappies present in the shallows. I did see some bluegills and lots of largemouth and 1 muskie. I couldn't really fish the deeper water as my lowrance wasn't working. Was a great day otherwise."

680335,Dutch,2012-03-26 22:41:00,831,"Crappies usually pick up later in the season.  Water temp needs to be in the high 50's/Low 60's before they really turn on.  Way too early to get numbers yet.  You'll get scattered fish, but that's it.  With water temps int he range they are now - low 50's, they are staging in deeper water.  They will start moving into the bays as they heat up quicker once the temp gets a bit higher."
680378,ecmilley,2012-03-26 23:38:00,2163,"yup lots of sunnys around and active, crappies havn't really got into them yet on sturgeon water temps were in the mid 50's last week and were between 42 and 52 on sunday depending on what part of the lake i was exploring"
