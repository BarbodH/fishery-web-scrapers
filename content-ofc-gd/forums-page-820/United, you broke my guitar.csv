What a great way to get back at people who treated you like crap!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SxYGB8m2HA...feature=related"

360062,Headhunter,2009-07-09 12:30:00,5703,"I was sent that yesterday and LOL'd! I just hope that United finds the humour in it and doesn't decide to sue him! They have many more lawyers than a funny guy from Timmins! And a Taylor guitar, is a terrible thing to waste! HH"
360064,MJL,2009-07-09 12:42:00,2427,"From the looks of it, United is now in discussions with him on fixing his guitar  http://www.timminspress.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1647542  Love the song"
360074,Rattletrap2,2009-07-09 13:04:00,1652,"This guy sounds really, really good to me! Great exposure for him and his band, .....not so good for United. Too bad things have to come to this point before they come good on their mistakes!  I never could understand how any airline could treat passengers luggage this way when the passengers are sitting on the plane WATCHING! Imagine what they do when we can't see them? I have witnessed this behaviour several times myself on different airlines."

When you're lifting other people's stuff day in, day out I think the complacency overtakes you. I don't justify it -- it still sucks -- but I can see why these guys might get to that point."

360108,anders,2009-07-09 14:18:00,1168,"Great song...but i dont think it is just united.  COming back from Vegas last week i watched the very, very happy people at the air canada counter take our luggage and litterally throw it on the conveyor.  It wasnt just ours, you could hear the banging while you were in line as the all the luggage was being tossed like they were nothing."

360157,Cookslav,2009-07-09 16:44:00,1457,That was great LOL!  Good on them for not going quietly
