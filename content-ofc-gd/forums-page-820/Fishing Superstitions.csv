360526,Beans,2009-07-10 13:19:00,3339, Not at all as far as I'm concerned...  I lost my daughter when she was 35...Oh my how she loved to fish !!!  We spread some of her ashes at her favorite spot to fish and I blew some into my tackle boxes so that she is always with me when I'm fishing...
360592,Lunker777,2009-07-10 15:09:00,866,"Some good ones so far ! haha  Mine, whenever I go out, usually I have a tin of Skoal with me.... if the fish arent biting, Usually Ill throw a ""Rally Dip"" in. Half the time, I wont catch a fish still.... but I do catch a small BUZZZ  I also hate catching a fish the first cast.... tends to be a slow night when that happens  Whats the deal with the Bananas ?????????"
360645,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-10 17:27:00,1022,"I have herd about the banana thing before, and let me tell you it is bad luck! Tournament anglers: hide banana's in your competitors boats"
360655,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-10 17:52:00,2038,Ok i'll bite ...   Whats with the banana thing...
360663,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-10 18:11:00,1022,"  It just brings bad luck, whether related to fishing or not.  My buddy wanted to bring a couple banana's in my boat a couple weeks ago and I actually told him either eat them before we get on the boat, or leave them in the truck. He ate them before we went out. Now that I think of it I think it still brought us bad luck, well him more than me as I caught 2 pickerel (which we were targetting) and he didn't catch any. Meanwhile we were using the same bait, although he did catch other types of fish. Another thing, I lost alot of fish that day, atleast 5-6, some of which were nice ones. Could of just been a coinsidence but you never know. Funny aint it? Leave your bananas at home, and dont even think about them   . Their not the greatest for you anyway, they take longer to digest."
360168,Twocoda,2009-07-09 17:36:00,4130,"OK so as fisherman we all carry a little hidden secret to our arsenal of tackle ...is it a certain lure,shirt,undergarment,technique ...what exactly makes the ""fish Gods"" shine on your bait to out fish your buddies...????  Use your own discretion on what ya want to donate to this thread...  For me i have so many that i couldn't possibly list them all.... but will say ...when i fish with worms ..i spray WD 40 on them ...it makes them sweet and i seem to turn more fish then most...also my socks NEVER match each other...  Have atter , have fun and shine the light for the new people that want to know how to be as good as you ...."
360169,Bitsmith2k,2009-07-09 17:39:00,396," i never have luck when i fish with ginger kids.. i dont know what it is, but if there's a red head in my boat, no one on it is getting anything.."
360179,Twocoda,2009-07-09 18:16:00,4130,simple solution for the red head syndrome...sunny days reds can ONLY drink mountain dew on the boat and must wear sb50 or greater sunblock ...on cloudy days ...eat only plumbs and nectarines ....drinks dont matter but the red headed person MUST still wear sunblock...
360184,Roy,2009-07-09 18:33:00,13728,I think I posted this in the last superstions thread I think.  If you get to your favourite lake and see this.....you might as well turn around and go home cause you just ain't gunna have a good day. 
360186,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-09 18:38:00,2038,Yep ...  Everytime I go out fishing i think this is it ..Today i'm going to get the Big One.....
360187,Twocoda,2009-07-09 18:39:00,4130,lol...i didnt know there was already a superstition thread..my bad....  In that pic the FISH GODS might be telling you that your number 1 ...to turn around and leave could be a mistake ...
360188,Twocoda,2009-07-09 18:43:00,4130,I have the same attitude whitespinnerbait...every drift ...every second.... every shadow that crosses the suns path ....is when im GOING to get the BIG ONE
360200,Garry2Rs,2009-07-09 19:14:00,1425,Ginger Kids are no problem...        Unless you're fishing behind them!!!
360205,fisher,2009-07-09 19:26:00,451,"Whenever I take my shoes and socks off, and dip my big toe into the water, the fish seem to 'pop' to the surface.       ......Okay, I am going on holidays starting tomorrow and I couldn't resist acting a bit foolish."
360206,Twocoda,2009-07-09 19:28:00,4130,see its sunny out and i bet she has sunblock on and the PFD overrides the mountain dew....  adorable young lady ....ill never get over the magic of a childs face while holding a fish ...good for her
360208,Bitsmith2k,2009-07-09 19:28:00,396, there's always a few exceptions to the rule garry.. though if you put her in my boat she wouldnt be pulling out nice fish like that..
360209,blaque,2009-07-09 19:35:00,2419,i NEVER bring a net. and i always fish the same side of the boat
360210,jediangler,2009-07-09 19:35:00,1923,"No bananas in the boat. All found lures are already lucky, since I didn't have to pay for them. Dragonfly landing on your rod tip is good luck and catching a sunfish is good luck. Catching a fish on the first cast is usually the only one I'll catch that trip."
360221,Joey,2009-07-09 19:50:00,9122,"I have to have my lucky hat.  I'll try others, but if they don't work, I go back to my lucky one.  If I'm wearing it and I'm not catching, I take it off and go hatless.  Joey"
360261,watertight,2009-07-09 22:28:00,50,I toss a nickel or dime out each side of the boat. An offering to the fish gods.
360265,wallyboss,2009-07-09 22:35:00,1095,"When I have a net in the boat , as soon as I get to my fishing spot I have to dip the net in water.    I never, never, never want to catch a fish on the first cast."
360296,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-10 00:38:00,2038, Could be worse........  What if it was a lucky '' Top ''  then you would have to take it off and go Topless ...
360299,Greencoachdog,2009-07-10 00:39:00,8163,NEVER wash your fishin' underwear!!!!
360311,Lakeshore,2009-07-10 00:58:00,56,I make it a habit of never grabnbing the net until I get a good hard look at whatever it is on the end of the line.
360312,irishfield,2009-07-10 01:01:00,26272,Never fish with Terry !!!!!

360511,Jonny,2009-07-10 12:59:00,1380,"Some good chuckles here. Mine's a bit more serious.  We lost our son Rob a couple of years ago (25 yrs. old). He loved to fish ever since he was a little gaffer and never got to do enough of it.  Whenever my wife and I go fishing we always take a laminated picture of him and prop it up on the dashboard of the boat. We like to think he's led some nice fish onto the ends of our lines.  I hope this doesn't put a damper on the fun stuff here, but that's my superstition."
