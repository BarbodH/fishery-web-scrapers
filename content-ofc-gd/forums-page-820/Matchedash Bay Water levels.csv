360585,NAW,2009-07-10 15:01:00,4022,"I fished the Wab. chanel last weekend.  I sayed between the bouys, and there was 8' - 12' steady to the bridge.  I didn't go to the east of the highway though.  Some guys where catching pickeral in the morning.  I didn't catch any though.  I went duck hunting in the bay last year.  I never saw my prop bounce out of the water so many time before.  Some very very shallow spots in there.  Lots of logs, and debrise in the water."
