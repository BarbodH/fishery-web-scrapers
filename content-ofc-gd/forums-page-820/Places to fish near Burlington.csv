Are there any fishing spots/lakes/streams within an hour's driving distance of Burlington that I can fish at that have fish that are safe to eat? I'd like to be able to eat some of the fish I catch.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks"
359395,davew3,2009-07-07 17:11:00,430,Check out a map of the Grand River from Fergus to Lake Erie. Lots of good spots that you can try.  Good luck

Tell us a bit about yourself and some of your great fishing exploits, etc. People are a lot more welcoming once we know that you are going to give back as well.  And don't forget to participate in others posts as well. Maybe you know of a spot that someone else is asking about, or have some gear that someone is thinking of buying and can give a review.  Welcome, and good luck."

360201,Garry2Rs,2009-07-09 19:18:00,1425,If you want fish to eat go to Hutch's or the Fortino's If you want to catch fish try Bay Front Park behind Hutch's on Bay Street North.
