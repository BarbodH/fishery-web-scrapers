Waldo has spent the whole day at the vets here in London where they doped him up took xrays, put on a temporary splint and monday will go to Guelph for his surgery due to the surgeon being on holidays here in town....Sam new he had hurt Waldo and spent all last night under the bed and until this afternoon.....Poor fella.... Heres a picture of the dynamic dual in rest mode..... "
