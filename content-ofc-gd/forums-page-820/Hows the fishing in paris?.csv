360439,Cudz,2009-07-10 03:52:00,2652,The Seine is a dirty river but does hold fish.  I would try trolling a rapala off one of those Bateaux Mouches.  I would use a J-9 or J-11.  They will catch almost anything.  Right in front of Notre Dame on the point is a great spot (but keep that on the down low)
360453,timmeh,2009-07-10 04:34:00,609,Be sure to try right across from the Eiffel tower. I've heard that's a hot spot too.

Nothing crazy big, just normal sized carp.  Fished the top area there with spinners and a few other baits and caught one very small bass.  Not sure if the bottom has anything more interesting, but if not I certainly wouldn't bother."
