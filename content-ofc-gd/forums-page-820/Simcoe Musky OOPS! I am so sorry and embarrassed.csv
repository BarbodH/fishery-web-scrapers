360505,Headhunter,2009-07-10 12:43:00,5703,"How did it taste? Like a musky, bow or chinny? LOL HH"
360510,oxcowboy,2009-07-10 12:59:00,544,"musky or not, that is still a heck of a fish.  i wouldnt mind catching one like that anytime, even if i was targeting musky.  nice catch.  jason"
360564,Pachone,2009-07-10 14:31:00,276,wow that IS a really healthy looking Pike.... and the size is huge!!!  meet u at barrie! lol
360565,fishnsled,2009-07-10 14:35:00,3520,Beauty pike!!
360566,markiemark70,2009-07-10 14:36:00,158,"Nice fish for sure. Just an innocent question here, but does holding a large fish like that (rather than horizontally) decrease its chance of survival? Or did he keep it?"
360577,Radnine,2009-07-10 14:52:00,1538," Cudz, with all due respect, after looking at the picture of your friend I think you should exhaust all known forms of education before resorting to physical violence. You would have your hands full duking it out with that Pike, let alone the monster that's holding it! Jim"
360579,bucketmouthjohnny,2009-07-10 14:55:00,115,"Wow!! that is a huge bass  Seriously though, nice pike!!!! Gotta agree with Radnine, you might have a chance with the frying skillet to the back of the head"
360588,blaque,2009-07-10 15:04:00,2419,"I agree radnine, if it were me..........I'd just grin and say...... Uhhhhhh, WoW, That there is a nice ""Musky"""

360595,bigbuck,2009-07-10 15:13:00,2449,"And here I was thinking that it's a Tuna!! LOL!! Your buddy should study the back of the fishing regs book, it shows pics of the various sportfish here in Ontario and their identifying characteristics. Nice Northern, anywhere you fish, that is a nice one!!"
360606,cram,2009-07-10 15:36:00,1733,"Aurora trout.  Seriously though - not everyone is going ot know the difference btwn a pike and a musky (half my friends certainly don't).  I remember as a kid my dad catching this huge pike on a crazy crawler......biggest pike i had seen. Looking back now, it was clearly a musky.  W e just didn't know any better."
360641,Cudz,2009-07-10 17:12:00,2652,We have fought twice.  Both times at a bar.  I won the first tilt and I am pretty sure the second fight was a draw.  He is big.  About 230 and strong as can be.  He is my workout partner as well.  We might go again.  I really don't mind a good scrap.
360649,scuro2,2009-07-10 17:39:00,904, You may want to buy him a fish identification picture book for Christmas.
360654,ciceri,2009-07-10 17:51:00,535,a sticker one!  ^^^
360679,steverowbotham,2009-07-10 19:10:00,1800,beauty pike nonetheless
360723,misfish,2009-07-10 21:31:00,29133,Liquid courage.LOL J/K  Thats a very respectful pike for the AREA.
360770,Photoz,2009-07-11 00:36:00,792,
360791,RickOnt,2009-07-11 01:24:00,669,Hey Photoz  Very Funny  i know where you are commin' from!!!  LOL
360218,Cudz,2009-07-09 19:48:00,2652,"My fishing partner went out to our bass spot with a mutual friend of ours today and they managed to catch a 17 pound musky.  You don't see that very often on Lake Simcoe.  THe bass fishing there has been a bit slower than usual.  Hmmm, wonder if a big musky was scaring away the bass. I have not seen the pictures yet and my friend is not the best at identifying fish but he swears it is a musky and not a pike. (He once confused a chinook salmon with a steelhead)  EDIT:  I am so sorry about this.  You have to forgive me.  I can't believe that I came on here after my buddy tells me it is a musky and I see the pics and it is a pike.  I don't know who is dumber, me for posting here before I saw pics or my buddy for his inability to identify fish species. I am so embarrassed.  The fish looks nice and healthy but IT IS A PIKE NOT A MUSKY!  I am going over to his house to punch some sense into him."
360223,Joey,2009-07-09 19:51:00,9122,That would definately be nice to see.  Ron will be interested in this and to see the pic.  See if you can get it.  Joey
360238,Tom McCutcheon,2009-07-09 20:38:00,627,"Muskies Canada has been working on reintroducing Muskie into Lake Simcoe for a number of years. This could be a good sign that they are healthy. When they get released the fingerlings are about 8 to 10 inches long and will generally take about two years to reach 24 inches. After that there isn't too many predators around, large enough to bother them.  Tom."
360241,BillM,2009-07-09 20:44:00,17367,"Wow, a 17lb'er?  That's been in there a while.  That definitely wouldn't have been a result from the restoration project I worked on 2 years ago in the Pool with the MNR."
360256,steverowbotham,2009-07-09 21:43:00,1800,"I would love to see photos of that!  I rose a big musky on a jerkbait at the north end 2 years ago, never bit and never saw her again."
360259,Cudz,2009-07-09 22:09:00,2652,"I will have pics tonight at 11pm. I will post them.  I am anxious to see them as well. Oh , and here is the kicker.  It was caught on a 2"" crankbait using 8 pound mono, no leader!!"
360260,misfish,2009-07-09 22:23:00,29133,"No leader required,just photos.LOL  They are in Couch,so Im not surprised he got one in Simcoe. There are stories still of guys getting them on the flats in the north/east part of simcoe.  Looking forward to the back ground shot.HAHA"
360263,Cudz,2009-07-09 22:31:00,2652,LOL. I will fix the background shot.  IT will exactly the same as all the bass/perch photos. IT was in the Barrie Marina
360285,BillM,2009-07-10 00:13:00,17367,The Barrie marina produces some monsters!!!!!
360289,misfish,2009-07-10 00:24:00,29133,You would know.LOL
360292,Greencoachdog,2009-07-10 00:30:00,8163,"If there aeren't any pics.. it's just a ""fish story""!!!"
360370,Ron,2009-07-10 02:33:00,1683,"Oh well Cudz.  Prolly still worth posting the pics of this Pike. Must have been  a nice sized Pike.  Cheers, Ron...."
360380,BillM,2009-07-10 02:46:00,17367,"Post it anyhow, we can argue if it's a musky or not"
360381,kickingfrog,2009-07-10 02:48:00,8333,TIGER TIGER
360385,Cudz,2009-07-10 02:53:00,2652,"Bill, I just got off the phone with him and he swears up and down it was a musky.   I have since imposed a rule about identifying fish.  He is not allowed to ID any fish or send out emails until I have seen the pics. I will post them.  LOL! I should get banned from here for starting such a story.  I have heard of a few musky taken in Simcoe and a few in Couch so it wasn't as far fetched as one might think.  When I was on the phone with him I asked him again and again if he wasn't confused and he said he was 100% positive it was a musky.  the only 100% he was, was wrong."
360386,Cudz,2009-07-10 02:53:00,2652,Not even Rob.  I wish.
360388,TerryC,2009-07-10 02:54:00,196,Prolly an Atlantic....
360394,Cudz,2009-07-10 03:02:00,2652,"Ok, Here is the fish.  It is a really healthy looking PIKE.  Fat and all fins seem to be in great shape.  He didn't have a measuring tape but he figures 40+ inches.  He is 6'2"" tall so that should give you some perspective.   [(I have another pic but you can see exactly which boat in the Barrie Marina it was caught near)"
360395,Joey,2009-07-10 03:04:00,9122,Well it certainly is a nice pike!
360396,ciceri,2009-07-10 03:05:00,535,That is a Monster. But how do you mistake that for a Muskellunge? You better start sending him pictures and quizzing him.
360399,Cudz,2009-07-10 03:07:00,2652,Don't even get me started.  He sent an email to eveyone saying how he caught this nice rainbow and when I looked at it it was a chinook.  Then when he caught a rainbow he thought it was a chinook.  Go figure.
360401,Beats,2009-07-10 03:08:00,543,"I think some ppl just think if it's that big it's automatically a muskie.  Great fish, no doubt, but it's clearly a pike!"
360404,taz4432,2009-07-10 03:11:00,19,"Wow...that's a beautiful pike! Definitely not a musky, but definitely nothing to sneeze at.  As for him not knowing his fish...some people just can't seem to get them right."
360496,BillM,2009-07-10 12:12:00,17367,"That's easily over 40, probably pushing 45.  Get him one of those fish charts, laminate it and make sure you tape it to his boat"
360500,Cudz,2009-07-10 12:32:00,2652,It is a big fish.  And as much as I am ragging on him I have to give him some props too. He managed to catch and land the fish using 8 pound mono and no leader.  He also did not have a net!  Good effort.  Too bad it wasn't a musky.
