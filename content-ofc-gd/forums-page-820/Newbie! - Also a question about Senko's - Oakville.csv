360746,jpmclean,2009-07-10 22:57:00,9,Greetings everyone - came across the site tonight when i was just doing some research on some bait and love the place so far (been cruising through some posts as a guest for an hour or so)  Typically i fish at Bronte Creek - mostly upstream from Petro as i live right at Bronte/Lakeshore. I used to fish as a kid but took a 10 year hiatus so i might as well be a newbie again plus i was fishing in England.  Quick question if anyone can help that would be appreciated:  Where can/should I get my hands on some Senko's in oakville? I wanted to try them out on some bass this weekend.  Anyone know of a store i can grab them from? - or even better anyone had a good time with them around bronte?  (Or should i try GULP?)  Thanks so much!  Joel
360756,okumasheffield,2009-07-10 23:26:00,318,Have you been to Bronte Outdoors right beside the intersection of HWY-25 & QEW?
360757,jpmclean,2009-07-10 23:33:00,9,Yeah i'm familiar with it - Frank there always helps me out with good advice  I'll try and give it a go.  I heard somewhere that Walmart might even sell them (tho id much rather buy local from B/Outdoors but Walmart is open late and sometimes i can get a vehicle after 8pm if the wife gets off work early)   Thanks!
