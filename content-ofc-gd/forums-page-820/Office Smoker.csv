360228,keram,2009-07-09 20:07:00,585,"After little reorganisation in the office I have noticed lonely two drawers file cabinet standing in the corner, ready to be recycled. What a waste I'm thinking. After long discussion with HEINEKEN ( R&D department boss ) , I've decided to make it useful again. So here it is OFFICE SMOKER Some features of the working prototype. 1 Portable size 2 Modular design 3 Antitheft security 4 Highly precise smoke wents 5 Sophysticated temperature control 6 Mobile    Due to mobility the unit can be moved from cubicle to cubicle in no time, High security locking device will prevent theft of the meat, when you enjoy quite time in the washroom or taking a nap in boiler room   Working module brackets can accept up to three removable and interchangeable racks to accommodate different sizes and shapes of meat    Power and smoke generator module includes hot plate with highly sophisticated temperature control, wood chips container and liquid container for adding extra flavour if desired It is self contained and can be moved to any file cabinet in the office. In test run unit achieved working temp of 235 F in about 12 min  Now I need some meat to run quality test"

360245,fishermccann,2009-07-09 20:58:00,655,"What a great idea, how many folks will build one now that we have seen your prototype. Thanks."
360252,GBW,2009-07-09 21:27:00,8460,"Wow, very cool way to recycle and a good way to mess with the others around you.  as they ask what's that smell you can blame it on someone lunch in the microwave."
360262,misfish,2009-07-09 22:31:00,29133,"Very interesting,but I see a couple of problems. Toxic paint(powder coating) and it,s not stainless.Rusting.  Nice job tho."
360268,Krisco,2009-07-09 22:52:00,67,"I'm with Misfish, I work in the coatings industry and I can tell you that 235 F for 4 or 5 hours in that unit will allow more then just flavour to permeate into your food."
360295,backbay,2009-07-10 00:37:00,773,"Aside from the powder coating coming off and ruining the fun, Red Green would be proud."
360298,keram,2009-07-10 00:39:00,585," Well, I'm not an expert in this, but I think that powder paint require few minutes of curing at  approx 325 F, so I think that 230 F is  o.k..  BTW the cabinet is not painted inside."
360353,Burtess,2009-07-10 02:20:00,901, But is the cabinet zinc plated inside????  Burt
360378,gino,2009-07-10 02:40:00,400,"cool ideea, to bad is painted"
360489,Hud,2009-07-10 11:55:00,140,nice job and you didn't even use duct tape.
360599,blaque,2009-07-10 15:18:00,2419,i thought this was going to be an invention for folks to sit at their desks and smoke cigarettes without having to leave for a smoke break
