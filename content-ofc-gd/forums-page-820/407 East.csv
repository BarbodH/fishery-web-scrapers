360182,charlesn,2009-07-09 18:25:00,551,"I'm planning on heading east towards P-borough tomorrow and was wondering if someone could update me on the 407 East extension.  I need to get to 35/115, so I will probably be better off taking 401 there in the morning with minimal traffic at those hours, but was hoping to avoid rush hour on the way back.  Can anyone tell me if the eastern extension to 35/115 is done yet?  Thanks,"
360183,fishermccann,2009-07-09 18:27:00,655,"No not done yet, a couple of years for sure!"
360185,ecmilley,2009-07-09 18:35:00,2163,"might be done in 15 years, you can take 7 to peterborough from the 407 but depending on the hour the 401 east in the morning is pretty good and fast from scarborough out just watch for the radar all along this corridor in the am"
360189,KelfuN,2009-07-09 18:43:00,246,"401 would be the best bet. when you are coming home, traffic doesnt start on 401 until the bowmanville area to ajax...when the express lanes begins, no traffic at all"
360197,Garry2Rs,2009-07-09 19:03:00,1425,"The 407 stops at Brock Road, in Pickering, you turn right for about 10 Km to reach the 401 then go east on the 401 to exit 436...Hwys. #35/115. Follow the 115 into Peterborough. If you are traveling early, taking the 401 all the way is shorter. You can PM me if you need directions to a specific location in Peterborough, or the best way to reach a certain lake/boat ramp etc. Garry2R's"
360202,charlesn,2009-07-09 19:23:00,551,"Thanks to all!  With the money they've made off of suckers like me, you'd think they coulda made an extension to Ottawa and paved it with gold by now..."
360215,Fang,2009-07-09 19:39:00,1330,Get to google map and check out Taunton Rd. It's a few miles south of the end of the 407 East but It'll take you over to 35. It's a bit faster that 7 and less travelled  Has always been my shortcut through Ajax Whitby when 401 is a mess
360229,Sinker,2009-07-09 20:09:00,8692,"Take the 401, even if you hit traffic, its still quicker than 407. once the 407 ends, its all traffic lights and mostly single lane. Traffic on the 401 will still be faster.  S."
360247,aniceguy,2009-07-09 21:03:00,1094,  god dont even go there with the etr.....
360417,Dutch,2009-07-10 03:34:00,831,401 will be fine that early as far as traffic goes.  I'll get you on the right path for going home.  See you in the a.m!
