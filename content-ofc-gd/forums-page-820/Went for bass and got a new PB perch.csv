359822,Cudz,2009-07-08 18:08:00,2652,"We were out on Simcoe early this morn to get some smallies.  Got several smallies but no real monsters.  My largest today was a 3 pounder and my buddy managed a 4 pounder.  It is kind of funy that I no longer think of 4 pound smallies as monsters.  I guess that is what Simcoe will do for you.  Too many 5+ pounders around. We are spoiled. Anyway, on a side note the perch were smacking our lures.  I have literally caught a thousand perch in my life and I honestly believe that this is my PB.  It measured 13.5"" long and I weighed it on my digital scale and it weighed exactly 1.25 pounds.  1 pound 4 ounces is not too bad.  The fish was very fat.  My largest smallie of the day, 3 pounds caught before 6 am.   My buddies largest smallie of the day, 4 pounds.   My PB perch   Again with a tape measure "
