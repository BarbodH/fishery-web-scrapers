360519,bigugli,2009-07-10 13:12:00,6138,"Coloured pics for recognition are great.  I still refer to my ""Freshwater Fishes of Canada"" ( Scott & Crossman)  Can't remember what edition. The standard reference book with black and white illustration plates. All 900+ pages."
360528,Jonny,2009-07-10 13:21:00,1380," Yep, I've got an old copy of that one too. I don't think there's another book out there with as much fine detail about Canadian fish.  I've got mine from when my father was running a toxicity lab for INCO. He monitored water quality in all the effluent waters for INCO operations in the Sudbury area. The bigwigs would always include his lab in any tour they were giving visitors. He had some nice trout in his aquaria!"
