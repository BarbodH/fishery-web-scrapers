I also want to thank all our sponsors with out there support it would be hard to afford the great prizes we have each year.  THANK YOU to Advance Taxidermny and wild life design http://www.advancedtaxidermy.com/ Woodie Baits Mike Swan http://www.swanmoving.com/ Can/Am charter Captan rick http://www.can-amcharters.com/ Trojan Tackle http://www.trojantackle.ca/ Big Catch out doors http://www.bigcatchoutdoors.com/index.php Barrettes small engine in Belle River Charles Weiss http://www.charlesweissart.com/ Lucky Strike St.Clair Hound Artifact musky lures Also the Hamilton Chapter of Muskies Canada for a great deal on the Beckman net again  The fishing was slow this weekend with not many monsters caught but there was alot of small fish from in the teens to the 40"" range this is great for the next few years of fishing here on Lake  St.Clair these fish seem to be chunky and growing nicely we will have alot of fun chasing them in 2011 I cant wait but for now here is how we did.  On my boat we ended up with a couple little ones and a big breakoff that was sad. Here I am with what I thought would be catching the winning fish we did catch one and loose on on the Firebass Woodie but not the winner one small 30"" range fish and a long line release that the wife lost.   Thanks to my wife for making the deserts that included this cake     Now for the winners 1 place-Dean McKnight 51.5""  2 place and also Chapter winner -Marc Gratton 48"" he is one of our good friends from the south he comes up each year from Kentucky.  3 place- Francis Bacon 46.25"" Mike the Mover trophy Largest fish Muskies Canada member- Francis Bacon 46.25""   I would also like to thank the KofC hall of Belle River for always taking care of us and the Steak dinner was great and I must not forget my wife for making the deserts along with this cake."
