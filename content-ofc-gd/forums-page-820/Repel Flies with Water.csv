If it works there it'll work anywhere! Hopefully it does cause it would be nice to have fewer mosquitos at the very least while on the BBQ and doing yard work.

360653,fish_finder,2009-07-10 17:49:00,370,"I've tried it, it works to some extent.  I don't know about the whole penny in the bottom of the bag thing though......I've never done that and its been succesful.  Didn't do anything for the skeeters though...."
