359901,JohnAB,2009-07-08 23:50:00,178,Well was back home at the cabin in Saskatchewan. Met up with Rob aka holdfast and we headed to a lake north of his place in Big River called Hackett Lake for some fishing. I must admit it was with some trepidation that I met Rob based on some of his comments on here but I am happy to report he is a good guy and a most generous host and not at all as he sometimes comes across on here. We had a lot of fun fishing and I am hoping to get back up that way the August long weekend with my boat so we can try Delaronde Lake.  Rob with the first pike of the day    My first pike of the day    First walleye of the day    Rob's biggest walleye    My biggest    Rob with the stringer for the day    Will improve the photo taking the next trip.

359939,Greencoachdog,2009-07-09 01:29:00,8163,"Thanks for posting that John!!!  I've been watching for this post since Holdie posted his report, I hope he posts the rest of his pics now.  Nevermind Holdies gruff exterior, underneath that Drill Instructor Sargent persona lies a little fluffy puppy!  Looks like y'all had a great time and I wish I could get up there and have a chance to fish with both of y'all!!!"

360014,holdfast,2009-07-09 03:40:00,1813,"More Photos.  looking Forward to try that Huge Lake Deleronde John.  All I know is past the Narrows is great fishing.  A days ride in my Boat if the water is calm    I would say John caught most of the Walleye using a minnow.  I was doing great till I lost my Micro Jig.  For some reason I kept loosing my fisjh when brought up 2 Feet from the Surface.  I tryed small hooks, Larger hooks.  Deep Hook sets, Light hook sets, and no hook sets. Still they were letting go.  Almost a dozen in a row.    "
