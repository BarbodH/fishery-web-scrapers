360420,Cudz,2009-07-10 03:36:00,2652,"I bought a boat today for my family to use.  It is not much of a fishing boat but I will still fish out of it. It is an 18' cadorette bowrider with a 4.3l I/O.  I looked at many boats in my budget and this was very clean.  I would have loved to buy a fishing boat but with 3 daughters (8, 6, and 3) I thought I had better get something we can all enjoy. Check out the fishfinder.  It is a classic. It also came with a nice shorelander trailer. I have to get rid of TONY now. here are a few pics      "
360423,GBW,2009-07-10 03:39:00,8460,"nice buy, I hope you all get many great years out of it."
360424,ciceri,2009-07-10 03:40:00,535,"Nice clean looking boat.  They named it Tony? Not many people would name a boat that, usually girl names."
360431,Cudz,2009-07-10 03:44:00,2652,"No, this is TONY "
360438,bigugli,2009-07-10 03:52:00,6138,You can't get rid of the tub!  You won't want to take that fancy bowrider out for your late fall perchin expeditions. Ice and fibreglass are a bad combination.
360443,kickingfrog,2009-07-10 03:54:00,8333,"Nice boat. I'm in a similar spot. I want a serious fishing boat, but we can't have/afford/store two boats. I'll spend the winter looking for a compromise."
360445,Cudz,2009-07-10 03:55:00,2652,My fishing partner has a 14' Sylvan sea snapper with a 20 merc.  That is what we fish out of these days.  Pure luxury compared to TONY
360447,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-10 04:00:00,947,I think I see room for a wireless bow mount trolling motor. Nice boat
360448,GBW,2009-07-10 04:01:00,8460,"so you posting ""TONY"" on the site for sale?  I'm sure some OFC'er that is stuck on land right now would be happy to give it a good home."
360454,Mike the Pike,2009-07-10 05:02:00,3421,I remember that boat Cudz I had one of those Thornes 12 footers exactly like yours I should have called it flipper because thats what I did with it.  I had an 8hp Yammy on it almost the same as you .Enjoy the new boat get it slimed.    
360456,Cudz,2009-07-10 05:09:00,2652,"Those boats are a bit less stable than new aluminum boats.  On a side note, Do you think your minivan is loaded down enough?  haha"
360457,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-10 05:25:00,947, wow that thing ain't squatting at all
360472,misfish,2009-07-10 10:15:00,29133,"Nice boat. Were going into the same direction.Something both the mrs,s and I can enjoy together. Going for a test drive Saturday morning.   Enjoy your new boat."
360554,troutologist,2009-07-10 14:07:00,951,"Congrats on the new boat.  Hang onto old Tony, one of my favorite posts of all time was the engineering design of your motor mount.  UW (and the Bomber) would be proud"
360572,bigbuck,2009-07-10 14:44:00,2449,"Congrats on the new to you boat!! I too had to compromise this year, I bought a 19ft Larson fish 'n ski earlier this year and love it!! It's comfy for the family and I can fish out of it comfortably."
360576,blaque,2009-07-10 14:51:00,2419,"If it floats, .....its a fishin boat.  And the fishfinder............LOL I HAD THAT EXACT FINDER years ago LOL I think its still out in the garage.  Try not to jump this one over any land masses"
360582,Radnine,2009-07-10 14:58:00,1538,I agree with this statement completely. Congrats on the new ride Cudz. The girls will love it! Jim
360590,lookinforwalleye,2009-07-10 15:06:00,4399,"Nice boat, look after it because with 3 daughters in a few years you will be perpetually broke!!!"
360610,ciceri,2009-07-10 15:45:00,535,"I'll take care of TONY for you, lol."
360639,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-10 16:58:00,10439,"Nice!!! It can be made into a decent fishing boat by simply making a removable box/pedestal seat system for the front, removing the cushions when fishing and removing the seat box when not. Plus add a bowmount trolling motor and yer good to go. If the cushions are fairly solid they could just be left in place. Putting in the removable seat base and seat would take 30 seconds. Heck if you wanted to get fancy you could even make a door on the stern end of the box that would open revealing a stack of plano boxes. Have a look at the artists rendering and imagine a pedestal seat and trolling motor.  "
360657,Joey,2009-07-10 17:53:00,9122,"Very nice boat, I'm sure you'll enjoy her.  Congrats.  Joey"
360771,Leecher,2009-07-11 00:40:00,7832,Great looking ride Cudz   Congratulations Now time to get her slimmed Leechman
