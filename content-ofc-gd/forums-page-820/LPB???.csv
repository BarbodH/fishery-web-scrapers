Anyone want to give me some advice on where to head out to and launch?  I am coming from Dunnville and currently have to rely on my 55lb MinnKota as my motor until my 35HP Merc gets fixed. So, I don't want to go anywhere where it will take a long time to get to with my motor. I'll be bringing my wife and son, so I hope to be able to get into some fish for them.  Any suggestions? Thanks!"

You'll never get out to the weedlines with your electric. lol  Good news is, the bass are right in the weedbeds. Buzzbaits and spinnerbaits early will rise them out, after that get your flippin' arms ready and pitch to pockets in the weeds.  You'll probably get a bunch just beating the bank.  Good luck!"
