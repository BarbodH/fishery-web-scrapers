358872,HTHM,2009-07-06 03:43:00,4082,I am looking for some info on where I might find some toothy critters in this area. I will be without my boat as SWMBO has said we are pulling the tent trailer and NOT the boat. I hope to be up in that area July 15 - 18 and then in the Pinery's area the next week. By the way a hook up is MOST welcome!
358880,Pachone,2009-07-06 04:16:00,276,"just went camping up in Tobermory which is in the same area. If you can find a place to fish in town, do it. There are some big pike that like to float thru the waters, along with trout and salmon too. if you can get off a dock... the area is really for smallmouth too. not exactly where you are staying, are going to be, nor if your gunna get a boat... either way... the fish are there.

359179,Musky or Specks,2009-07-07 00:49:00,2710,Head over to Cyprus Lake National Park. First thing morning or evening go to the outlet creek in the lake There is a big shoal here. Wade out as far as you can. Cast the drop off should be good for some smallies.

360393,irishfield,2009-07-10 03:01:00,26272,"Thanks Albert.... gotta do something to pass time here.  Tell Myia you're off the OFC fishing board, with me recommending you, and she'll only charge you an EXTRA 10%  LOL !!!  Lakers are supposed to be pretty good. If you don't have a clamp on rigger or steel line... use a three way and a big weight to get down to the depths.  Wayne"
