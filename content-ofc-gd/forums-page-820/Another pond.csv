360254,bigugli,2009-07-09 21:30:00,6138,Got out for a few hours this morning to try yet another pond. Biggest bite today was the one that swallowed my bobber as it hit the water. It was a big boil and it probably still has it in its gullet.  There were quite a few large WGSF around getting in the way.   There were also some 1/2 -1 1/2 lb bass to keep me entertained.   I'll have to work the other shore next time out.
