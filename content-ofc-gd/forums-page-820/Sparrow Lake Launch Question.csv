I have been doing some research, and I beleive there's one at Franklin Park (off Kilworthy Rd).  Can anyone confirm this for me??  Thanks,"
359444,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-07 19:07:00,947,Yes there is a launch at that end of the road it's a long launch and parking is limited.  I just pay the 15 to launch at the south end in Lauderdale Marine

We tried to put the boat in there last year when we stayed at silver pines and wound up with the car more in the water than the boat!   When it came time to get the boat out, we went over to the marina and just payed the money to use that ramp, SO much easier."
