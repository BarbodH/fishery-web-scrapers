360623,Jonny,2009-07-10 16:12:00,1380,"My wife and I sometimes take out a friend of hers with us when we go fishing. The friend doesn't fish --- just likes to go out with us on a nice day and enjoy the outing and the shore lunch. I usually have four or five rod-and-reel outfits in the boat. I always assumed that we're OK as long as she doesn't put a line in the water. Am I wrong?  We have also taken her friend out with us to our ice hut occasionally. We always only have four lines in the water, though we have about 8 rigs stored in the hut, and usually have six or eight holes cut (both inside and outside the hut) so we can move around our four rigs once in a while. Again, the assumption is - four lines in the water, two per person with a fishing license."
340690,bigpikemike,2009-05-12 16:02:00,52,  omg too funny....thats what i do when i bring my buddies fishin in quebec....but it costs me 54 bucks to fish for the year in ontario....got to love kaybec 15 bucks for the year and the whole family is covered....even my gay lover (non resident fishin buddy)
340691,capt bruce,2009-05-12 16:04:00,820,"woodsman it was a few(many now im ageing myself) years ago and they didnt have a card than just I think a pink piece of paper, I think it was why they did bring in the card  and  made it clear (  ""It is an offence to attempt to obtain more than one card. It is also an offence to provide false information on a card application."" Pg. 5 of Fishing Ontario 2008-2009 Recreational Fishing Summary.) that it was one for each person . I would NEVER do such a thing again but it got me thu a  very confussing spring . Was very confussing the first year with no one really understanding the rules or believeing that they would really bring in  a license, the license sellers or the fishermen , we in Ontario just got used to the fact you didnt need a license and than we did I dont think many paid attention to the rule change and untill that day I was very confussed as to how I was to inforce the rule, now we have the cards and graded licenses etc. and I think most if not all serious fishermen have got used too and know all the rules and understand the need for liceneses ."

I was also thinking of the situation of life jackets or seat belts ie an adult responsible for minors thats all.

340760,solopaddler,2009-05-12 20:26:00,8605, That's pretty much exactly what my license fees were as a non resident of QC. Last weekend when I opened the camp I figured I'd grab my license. Pulled out 3 twenties figuring that'd cover it ($53 last few years). It's now $63.  (It's worth it though  )

341022,MAzing,2009-05-13 12:24:00,43,Someone I know took out a guy from work 2 summers ago. The CO showed up and the guy didn't have a license so he took the rod he was using and even though he was explained that the idiot didn't own any equipment he asked the boat owner wich tackle box he could take. These were musky tackle boxes so he lost his shirt that day.  Oh ya the visitor got the fine but it was no where near the loss the boat owner suffered.

I don't own a motor boat but do have a canoe and rent several motor boats each year.  I fish alot with friends and extended family.  Every year I run into the problem of no licence / forgoten licence as well as the ""I'm just watch"".   I hate having to lecture friends and family but I'm not losing any tackle or paying any fines because of them.  Cheers,"

360410,pikehunter,2009-07-10 03:26:00,1659,"As quoted from the regs:  Non-Canadian residents need an Outdoors Card to fish in Ontario if they are 18 years of age and over.  (NOTE: Non-residents 65 years of age or older are not exempt from requiring a licence).  The sportfishing licence tag (one year or eight day) or the conservation fishing licence tag (one year or eight day) accompanies the plastic Outdoors Card.  Canadian residents need an Outdoors Card to fish in Ontario if they are at least 18 years old but have not reached their 65th birthday.  The sportfishing licence tag or the conservation fishing licence tag accompanies the plastic Outdoors Card.  Ontario residents need an Outdoors Card to fish in Ontario if they are at least 18 years old but have not reached their 65th birthday.  The sportfishing licence tag or the conservation fishing licence tag is affixed to, or accompanied by, the plastic Outdoors Card.  Says nothing about a minor needing a licnece or his/her catch counts as part of yours.  link  I ensure all who boards has a licence. Took a German college student I was attending classes with a couple of years ago out for a day of fishing. I made sure that he had one, even took him to the tackle shop to buy one. Funny thing was, he was not an immigrant, an Ont. resident or Canadian Resident as he was only here on a students visa for one year. Told the guy at the shop he needed a non resident licence, the guy starts to fill out the paper and he gets yelled at by the store employee, ""You need a resident licence, I asked why? He says the guy is writing down a Hamilton address, he is a resident!"" OK whatever you say, but he had no documentation as to his Hamilton address. So that was that, he got an Ont. fishing licence."

If the CO wanna seize it.. they very well could ruin your day. It's a pain.. but I've started verifying all on board are legal before leaving the dock. Remember anyone (Ontario Resident) over 65 still has to be able to provide proof of age even though they don't need a licence. Many people, like me leave, my wallet behind when out in the boat.  ..and I forgot to check that Jose fella before letting him on back in December..."

340570,kickingfrog,2009-05-12 03:45:00,8333,"My opinion, which means squat, is that if they are minors (and they need a licence) probably. If is your boat and we're talking adults, probably not, although I believe all equipment used by someone breaking the regs can be confiscated. That's up to the CO's discretion. I understand how delicate something like this can be in a group of friends and/or family, but if it is your boat it could be your butt on the line. Good luck."

There was two of them in the boat and the C.O. informed them that they must both stop fishing and return to get it before fishing again. They were 4km from the cottage and the guy with his card wanted to keep fishing until lunchtime then go back. The C.O. said that unless they wanted to surrender all but one of their fishing rods to him, that they both have to be in possesion of their outdoors cards to continue fishing."
340614,POLLIWOGG,2009-05-12 12:04:00,835,One CO wouldn't let the rest of us fish with an unlicensed person on board.
340617,Greencoachdog,2009-05-12 12:15:00,8163,I'm a little unclear on the concept here... you're going fishing and you know you need a license???  Shouldn't it be in your possesion with your drivers and vessel operators licenses?... or do I just take my fishing too seriously?   ... and what about an open container (alcohol) in the boat?

He doesn't fish, doesn't like to fish, but just wants to be on the boat and take pictures. Does he need to have a license?

340658,capt bruce,2009-05-12 14:12:00,820,"First year for licenses , I was running my boat out of port weller in early April for lakers off the bar . I had told every one over the phone when they booked that this year evryone needed a license but I never bothered to check , Im not a CO ?? Just got set up one morning early and fish on, guy fights a nice 10 lb king , as I net fish Co pulls up . comes aboard asks the guy who just landed fish to see license , NO LICENSE.He than asks for a license for the other 7 rods I had out (only 1 rod per guy than ) lucky counting mine we had 7 lincenses on the boat . After threating to take the rod ,reel ,down rigger ,rod holder, net  and lure that was used by the guy with no license , he just fined the guy who caught the fish with no license and  told me if he saw more than 7 lines out that day he would be back and he would take the stuff . Needless to say we didnt run more than seven lines and I saw him watching me with his glasses a few times that day .What I did than was to buy 8 licenses so I allways had a license for each rod and when stopped all we had to do was for everyone to hold up a license and all was well , not sure how legel this is but never had a proplem since as long as each guy fishing holds up a license he or any other CO has never come aboard to check . ????"
340663,Fisherman,2009-05-12 14:21:00,7201,I didn't think you were allowed to possess more than one licence.

Now I find most if not all guys are used to to fact you need a license in the summer. BUT Ice fishing is another thing , the CO from Port Perry tells me he cant belive the amount of fines he gave to people who rented huts from me this winter , and I only have 8 huts ???"
340670,Woodsman,2009-05-12 14:43:00,1286,This is correct if you are referring to those under 18 that are non residents of Canada. If they are under 18 and residents of anywhere in Canada than no license is required and they have there own limit (Sport Fishing limits).
340672,irishfield,2009-05-12 14:56:00,26272," If you are not fishing..  you don't need a licence. Just like listening to that VHF radio. (insert Women in boat full of fishing gear..reading a book joke here) No doubt a CO took that tact though (since they all seem to have a personal rule book), epecially in Jedi's case where the guy was fishing and his licence was ashore. CO probably figured if he left they'd both go right back to fishing.  I had both daughters, a boyfriend and myself out last year. We had three rods out, because one daughter forgot her OD card in Toronto. CO came along side and we showed him 3 licences and I told him the daughter was our official photographer for the day because she was dumb and forgot her licence behind. He had no issues.. said we were only running 3 rods and he'd seen only 3 rods for quite some time.  As a coincidence... she took the pic in my avatar! Showing she wasn't sitting in a ""fishing"" chair, but the forward passenger seat."
