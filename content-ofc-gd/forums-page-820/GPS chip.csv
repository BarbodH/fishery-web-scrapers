360125,Court R,2009-07-09 14:59:00,213,What is the best GPS chip for central Ontario lake's for my Humminbird.  Thanks Court
360126,Stoty,2009-07-09 15:00:00,2910,Navionics Hot Maps Premium 2009 is a great chip.
360128,Bitsmith2k,2009-07-09 15:10:00,396, i'll second that too..
360131,Roy,2009-07-09 15:15:00,13728,"Just a little heads up here. Verify on the Navionics site as to which chips are compatible with Humminbird units. Some are fully compatible with some chips. Other are not compatible. And other still, are partially compatible.... i.e. Not all of the chip's functions are available.  You can find that information here: http://www.navionics.com/Plotters.asp  Hope this helps."
360133,Court R,2009-07-09 15:18:00,213,Is the gold any good
360140,Roy,2009-07-09 15:33:00,13728,"Yes the gold is good but be careful now, they are marine charts...basically the same depth/contour info BUT, the marine charts don't have the same bodies of water. The charts are for the great lakes and connecting bodies of water such as the Rideau system and the Trent Severn system."
360278,Billy Bob,2009-07-09 23:37:00,5865,By FAR the best deal out there right now if still available is the Navionics Hot Maps 2008 chip (almost the same as the 2009) for 50% less than the 2009 chip.  Here's the deal..........  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true
