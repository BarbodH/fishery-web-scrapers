360459,bubblez,2009-07-10 05:33:00,8,cool pic can anyone make out what kind of fish that is? kinda curious
360474,Whitespinnerbait,2009-07-10 10:26:00,2038,Osprey =
360480,Randy,2009-07-10 10:59:00,115, I kinda think its a small pike or walleye (pickeral).
360488,fisherman7,2009-07-10 11:53:00,325,Amazing birds. Used to watch them at Lagoon City Marina. There are a number of Osprey nests on telephone polls just north of Beaverton on the road by the lake. Don't know the name but just follow the lake and you can't miss them.
360508,Jonny,2009-07-10 12:50:00,1380,I love ospreys. (I guess you can tell from my avatar.)  They're a fascinating bird to watch when they're fishing.  Here's a pic I took last summer of one just a second or two before it hit the water about 200 yds out from our shore... 
360513,Raf,2009-07-10 13:04:00,3495,    osprey diet:   
360520,huey graphite,2009-07-10 13:12:00,362,Cool pics. Too bad we couldn't train them to take down cormorants.
360523,Jonny,2009-07-10 13:13:00,1380,"Great shots, Raf!  What's that toothy skull you're holding in the last pic?"
360529,Raf,2009-07-10 13:23:00,3495,couldnt figure it out.  bowfin maybe?  it kinda looked like a catfish skull but the teeth had me puzzled.
360530,BillM,2009-07-10 13:26:00,17367,  I'd say bowfin as well..
360539,cuillerierk,2009-07-10 13:46:00,32,"Wow what an amazing bird, I've never heard of it before. (well i heard the name but... )  I'm reading up on them as we speak. Truly amazing."
360547,Jonny,2009-07-10 14:01:00,1380," It's fascinating to watch them fish.  An osprey will make slow lazy circles about 60 to 100 yards above the water (my guess). When it sees a possible target it will stop and hover, beating its wings rapidly to stay in one place. If the target isn't good, it will resume its glide. But if it's a good one - watch out! It will stoop (dive), sometimes with a quick pause part way down (to line up better I guess), and then smack the water hard, disappearing in the spray. If it comes up with a fish in its claws, it will shake itself to get the water off its feathers and then line up the fish underneath it, ALWAYS with the head of the fish pointing forward for streamlining. Then it will fly off to its nest."
360557,tbayboy,2009-07-10 14:13:00,1497,Love these birds.  Here's on fishing on the Grand a couple years back that I managed to film:    hard to see in the video but he got himself a fish on that dive.  And some photos I've taken of them:  
360586,Jonny,2009-07-10 15:03:00,1380,Great stuff.  Found this on youtube as well... she works for that fish!...  
360827,splashhopper,2009-07-11 03:09:00,2931, a BIG one
