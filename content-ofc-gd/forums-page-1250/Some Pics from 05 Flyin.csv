48438,solopaddler,2007-03-17 21:34:00,8605,"Cool! I've got fond memories of Whiteclay and that very camp. When soloing through there a few years back a group of guys from Ohio staying at that outpost befriended me and invited me over for a steak dinner and some cold beers Good times, they were a great bunch of guys."
48440,mattyk,2007-03-17 21:40:00,2110,nice shots phil. Thanks for sharing.
48442,Whopper,2007-03-17 21:42:00,2174,"Thanks TG, most of the walleyes caught that week were in depths from 10 to 25 feet. Some were gold and some were silver and black or green and black, if you notice the one pic I have blue residue on my white tshirt from a few that were caught. That pike had been harassing my buddy and bit him off twice fishing for eyes before I put the whammy on him.  Wasn't a big fish but I called him and my bud couldn't believe it.  Lew they could drop me off and leave me there for a whole summer and it wouldn't bother me one bit.  Oh by the way this is one of the lakes that solepaddler has went through on at least one of his journeys.  Whopper  sorry solo you were replying while I was typing"
