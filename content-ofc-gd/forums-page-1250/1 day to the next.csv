48732,Jigger,2007-03-18 16:57:00,1237,"Congrats, CC, I knew you'd find it sooner or later. WTG!"
48738,SlowPoke,2007-03-18 17:16:00,2984,I miss the capitals CC. Your reports have gone downhill since you stopped using capitals.
48753,Marko,2007-03-18 17:58:00,854,"Just came back from Bronte, nothing happening there. Water was brown prety much and i dont think anybody cought anything. Couple of guys are fishing and some other people starting to show up. T his was my first time fishing for steelheads and it was a tough one."
48754,ccmtcanada,2007-03-18 18:04:00,7971,Scott...where I normally fish for steelies is normally like what you just described...LOL.  I'm hoping the waters clear throughout the day and maybe bly and I will hit a spot tonite.
48883,Victor,2007-03-18 23:07:00,1609,"i went out to one of the eastern tribs this morning with a fellow OFNer as well, not a hit, it was quite windy and alot of slush was coming down ..."
48889,Pigeontroller,2007-03-18 23:21:00,2793,Why are you whispering?
48890,Hooked,2007-03-18 23:24:00,891,"  AGREED!  I JUST DON'T RECOGNIZE YOUR POSTS ANYMORE EITHER.  TOO SMALL TO READ. OH WELL, GO GET NEXT TIME."
48905,canadian_copper,2007-03-19 00:08:00,925,well some say i never get skunked but yes i do!!! rare but i do  lol hmmmm where to go tomor  lol
48906,Canuck2fan,2007-03-19 00:17:00,1444,Had the same result as you today CC.... the first place I tried looked prime but the dang fish were only interested in the fly hatch. The second place there were so bergs flying out it couldn't be fished.
48911,canadian_copper,2007-03-19 00:24:00,925,i think the cold snap played a role in the bite as well!!! not agressive today!!! i seen fish but thats all  lol
48916,Canuck2fan,2007-03-19 00:31:00,1444,"It could have been the change in temp, I tried everything I had with me. A local who was right next to us had some of the sweetest looking roe I have seen in a long time and he got skunked too.  I did have plenty of amusement when I got to watch my buddy trying to figure out how to use his brand new center pin.... I also learned that when I get a pin I will heading out all alone to figure it out so I don't cause anyone to fall in because they are laughing so hard."
48917,danc,2007-03-19 00:32:00,4677,"Dang CC. I found this the other day and I've been waiting to use it for one of your posts, but it looks like I won't get the chance. Don't make me dig this out in the future...  "
48969,wallacio,2007-03-19 02:42:00,475,That's what keeps steelheading interesting...fish and/or ideal conditions are here one day and gone the next.   Making educated guesses which Great Lakes tributary to fish any given time is half of the fun!  Saturday was productive for me...there was a good window from the time the slush burned off (mid-morning) until the influx of meltwater (late afternoon) made for dirty conditions as you described.  Good luck to all that are able to get out this week.     
48970,cityfisher,2007-03-19 02:47:00,959,nice fish wallacio !!
48982,camillj,2007-03-19 03:20:00,1988,CC YA GOT A PM  J.
48986,young_one,2007-03-19 03:27:00,620,"Hmmm, you are still one of the best steelhead fishermen on this forum. Fish or no fish, great report. Caps are better, actully my most respected English teacher at school writes EVERYTHING in CAP.  - Will"
