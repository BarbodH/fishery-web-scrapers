48271,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-17 12:38:00,4399,"Don`t forget one of them portable battery packs i know most bigger boats nowadays have 2 or 3 batteries and the chance of running all 3 flat are slim but they are handy if your cranking battery needs a little help, Canadian Tire usually has them on sale, a good sharp knife to cut anchor rope you never know when that anchor will jam on the bottom, a first aid kit in case you grab the business end of a Musky and maybe think of a float switch for your bilge pump if it`s not already automatic. Enjoy your new rig I got a new full windshield boat last fall and they are nice on those cold mornings."
48275,lew,2007-03-17 12:46:00,12767,"I carry booster cables in my boat too, incase my cranking battery ever dies in the middle of the lake for whatever reason, I can boost it from one of my deep cycles, or I can use them to help a stranded boater, which I've been able to do a couple times."
48288,OhioFisherman,2007-03-17 13:21:00,6623,"On a boat that size my first pick would be an electric trolling motor, at least 74 pound thrust, 24 volt. You are required to carry a paddle or oar? Just my experiance that they are all but useless, well as a push pole if the water is shallow.  2 anchors and extra anchor line, in most cases 50 feet of anchor line is more than enough, but having an extra 100 feet or so on board is a margin of safety.  Like Lew mentioned jumper cables are a good bet. Most motors have a fuse under the cowl, find out what size and carry a spare!"
48319,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-17 15:11:00,4399,Now that you have your list of must have`s for your new boat i would suggest it`s time to look for a larger boat to carry all that stuff!!!!
48321,taper,2007-03-17 15:17:00,611,I agree with Ohio fisherman a paddle on a larger boat is useless. I carry a push pole and a spare anchor. You don't need a paddle if you have 2 anchors with at least 100 of rope. Don't forget in larger bodies of water you need that length of rope to anchor steadily in the waves. I think the rule is 7-1 for overnight and 5-1 for general anchoring.
48329,Tybo,2007-03-17 15:35:00,1373,The only thing that I can add is to find out if the electrical system is fused or breaker. If they are breaker system you don't want the auto reset ones  The reason why is that most trip do to a short. They will cool and reset them selfs creating the short again and again till the system burns it's self out. Usually causing a fire.

But when we were stuck on the dock due to wind and out comes a charcoal bbq and bergers, chips and dip  couple jugs of rum etc. it was ALL RIGHT!"
48352,Pigeontroller,2007-03-17 16:50:00,2793,A spare prop and the tools to change it! I consider the spare prop like a spare tire!
48354,keram,2007-03-17 17:04:00,585,"Great advices from everyone, but  In my opinion   you have to decide for yourself three things  1. What I have to have ? 2. What  I should have ? 3. What I want to have ?  Like somebody's said before you do not want to take you garage with you on the fishing trip, or if you do you will sink before you start fishing ( or you will need small barge or pontoon towed behind (with all the ""neccesities"") your boat if you want to be prepared for  for anything and everything..... If I had to do it this way, I should give up fishing long time ago. Just use your common sense.  For comparison: let say you've bought new car Do you care in your trunk?  spare battery ? jumper cables ? brake pads ? spark plugs ? brake fluid? can of oil? I could list tens more, but it is not my point  As I understand your boat is new, just enjoy it the way you want  Just not to discurage you  , you have to remember that you have also trailer, and obviously there are few things you have to have, should have and want to have.  My 0.02$"
48398,mdej,2007-03-17 19:48:00,98,"ROPE  - Lots of rope, and cleats on each side of the boat.  Bumpers - Don't want to pull up to that old dock and scratch all the paint off.  Knot Tieing Book - Don't want that new boat to float away  Patience - When you first pull into dock the boat, you will be going to fast, you will hit the dock, you will get used to it, just don't freak out.  A checklist for trailering - Including remembering to remove transom straps, check for power before floating off the boat, etc, etc."
48523,ryanheritage,2007-03-18 00:00:00,180,"I think maybe you should keep us OFC'ers off your boat!!!!! with all the stuff they would bring yer boat might sink!!!!! lol...... The poor guys first boat and he already thinking he should spent less to afford all the stuff to go on it!!! lol  Jackets, survival kit, a boaters kit( you pick up anywhere), and you should be good to go for an outing... Of course there is OH so much you COULD bring but each trip is different... Only bring what you need for each trip. But do have some spare parts in case. ie prop, fuses, gas, plugs (spark and hull), and oil . and a tool kit. learn your sonar inside and out and you will be good to go."
48573,love2fishhave2work,2007-03-18 02:37:00,212,"Thanks everyone for your suggestions, lots of smart and good advice.  One thing i would like someone to comment on.  I was told that when trailoring a boat, often the bearings on the wheels get worn and may cause the wheel to fly, hence I should keep extra sets in the car and watch for wobbeling.  Has this happened to anyone?"
48582,taper,2007-03-18 03:01:00,611,Check your bearings every spring to ensure no wear and repack with grease. Replace if any wear is noticed. After that just take a visual for signs of grease being thrown past the seals every time you go to pull away. Under normal circumstances and a bit of your attention you should have no troubles at all.
48156,love2fishhave2work,2007-03-17 01:27:00,212,"I am looking for advice from everyone who has a boat on this board.  I will be picking up a new boat in a couple of weeks that i picked up at the boat show a few months ago.  18 foot aluminum.  I have never personaly owned a boat.  I am sure there are lots of little things that i should have in my boat that i would never think of.  So with that said i am going to the sportsman show tomorrow and will be looking to but some of the essentials.  I can figure out the oar, life jackets, emerigency kit but i need some advice on what else are must haves that are not legal requirements that i cannot think off.  Any and all advice welcome."

And keep a a small gas can too. and a small cheapo tool kit you know one of those job mate ones from Canadina tire so you can do on the spot repairs... duct tape, knife and gear clamps."
48244,taper,2007-03-17 07:47:00,611,Definitely a spare plug as Slowpoke has mentioned and I always carry 2 anchors for still fishing. I can't remember if it was mentioned but a good first aid kit. Polarized glasses are another must.

If cup holders aren't already built into the boat, you may want to install a few to hold your drinks......nuthin worse than hitting a wave and having your Coke spill all over the new carpet  Always a good idea to carry a cell phone with you for emergencies.  Congrats on the new boat !!"
48260,Mike the Pike,2007-03-17 12:18:00,3421,When you buy your Anchor buy the rubber coated one it won't stratch your boat.Don't forget to bring the fishing spirit.
48261,love2fishhave2work,2007-03-17 12:20:00,212,thanks everyone for helping out.  I may have to create a few more compartments.  one would never think of this stuff  without prior experience and my guess is some bad experiences.
