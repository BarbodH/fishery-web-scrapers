48708,Tootsie II,2007-03-18 15:23:00,162,"I have to agree with you if you're over 50. Came back from two week fishing trip near Shining Tree in 2004. Noticed a small amout of blood on the side of the stool. The resulting colonoscopey saved my life. Caught the big ""C"" in the early stages low down in my rectal area. I now have a permanent colostomy but that doesn't stop me from still spending at least three weeks in the bush every year. Not everyone needs the ""scope"" but it's something we all should discuss with our GP during our annual physical."
48710,easton13th,2007-03-18 15:29:00,371,Early detection is the greatest!!! 5 years ago my Father got the big C prostrate....Had the surgery and saved his life. I'll never forget the first time we got back on the lake after he recovered. For years to come my kids and I have a fishing partner because of early detection.
48827,pikehunter,2007-03-18 20:39:00,1659,"Had a physical 2 weeks ago. The doc asked if I had any blood from ""that area"" of the body. Told him occasionally when the old hemorrhoids flare up. His response was all that bleeds is not always hemorrhoids. I go to see a specialist in June. Better safe than sorry I guess"
48857,danbo,2007-03-18 22:20:00,2646,"I'm 50.5 years old now! I asked my Doc ""What'cha gonna do with that great big probe?"" He said, ""I'm checkin' for squirrels first!"""
48860,danc,2007-03-18 22:27:00,4677,May 29th I'm having the big look see. Can't wait.
48879,pikehunter,2007-03-18 22:57:00,1659," I haven't had one of these yet, but I have had the prostate biopsy done a few different times. Get ready for the pipe! Youch!   Snap!   Zing!!   There goes another chunk   out of the prostate! I wonder which test is worse?"
48881,Gerritt,2007-03-18 23:02:00,6129,I will never look at my body the same way again after reading this thread.... might need a pill to sleep tonight...   Gerritt.
48887,danc,2007-03-18 23:16:00,4677,"Colon cancer is one of the easiest cancers to cure, yet one of the most difficult to detect. I made my appointment with my family doctor nearly a year ago. That's how long it took to see a specialist. Don't be shy guys. You gotta do what you gotta do."
48888,Tootsie II,2007-03-18 23:21:00,162,"The worst part about a colonoscopy is having to take the stuff that cleans you out and staying close to the toilet for several hours. They usually give you a mild anaestetic ( I believe they use the ""date rape drug"" and you won't feel a thing as far as the scoping goes."
48892,Gerritt,2007-03-18 23:25:00,6129,"I would want to be hit over the head with a sledge hammer to make sure I am ""out"" not looking forward to my 40's if this is what I get to look forward too.... I wonder if they give you a  kiss after at least, I know I normally get a kiss after I get ....... well I will stop myself there... perhaps a phone number?   Gerritt."
48939,easton13th,2007-03-19 01:02:00,371,You may not get a kiss BUT What happens in a doctors office stays in a doctors office
48946,Rattletrap2,2007-03-19 01:24:00,1652,"DanC, At least you get the long week-end in first! I had my Gall Bladder out ON the May 24 week-end. What the hell was I thinking? LOL"
48952,danc,2007-03-19 01:38:00,4677,"  LOL Rattletrap2... Believe it or not, I planned this around the May long weekend. If I was scheduled for triple bypass that weekend, I would have changed the date. I like your way of thinking..."
48972,OhioFisherman,2007-03-19 02:54:00,6623,"My grandfather(mom`s dad) died of colon cancer back in the early 60`s. They lived upstairs from us in a 2 story house in Cleveland. Things weren`t as good as they are now, we got to see him suffer every day. Grandma didn`t speak english well and my Mom and Aunt got to play nurse. Not a fun job, most or all of his colon was removed and he pooped thru a hole in his belly. Discovered late, back then I don`t know if they had anything they could have done anyway.  I had the colonoscopey about two years ago, part of my diagnostics for MS, I was having trouble, they needed to be sure I didn`t have colon cancer so a good idea. Prep was the worst part, I ate mostly fruits and veggies and cereal for a couple days before. They had given me a gallon jug with some powder in it, fill with water and chill.  I think I had to start drinking it like 12 hours before I was due at the hospital, I finished drinking it sitting on the can. It worked!  Wife took me to the hospital, here they specify they won`t do it if you don`t have someone to drive you home, you maybe be groggy. We checked in, they wanted me to watch a short movie about it, No! I don`t want to know nothing!. I had to wait in a hospital bed for a short period, they put a IV in my arm, then wheeled me in. Doc asked me some questions, I told him I didn`t have any problems before I got sick, but may have MS. They put a needle in the IV told me to count to 10, LOL I got to 1. I woke up in recovery. Piece of cake, probably no one is eager, there is a purpose, it can save your life, or more grief."
48991,Tootsie II,2007-03-19 03:44:00,162,"Nice to see that most of us keep our priorities straight through all of this. After my first colostomy/cancer surgery in Feb. 2004, I had to stay off work for 16 weeks. During that time my cousin asked if I wanted to come up to Mattagami Lake in the late May, early June (last two weeks of my convelescence ). Heck, couldn't turn that down. My fishing partner managed to talk his wife into letting him go to. This year will be our third year there. Then went on our regular 13 day trip to Shining Tree area in late July that year. That was our 26th year there. Last year at my 1st annivesary colonoscopy check, the surgeon suggested that I get a small stomal hernia fixed before it became a problem. That was in late June. NO WAY until I got back from the 14 day July/August trip. You see we've been sneaking in an extra day every year.  Yeh, our wives have noticed it. Had the hernia fixed Jan. 23rd, off work til last Saturday and I'll be fine in time for the first week in June and the 15 day trip in July. My fishing partner retires tommorow.  And yes we do catch fish. I made the mistake of reminding my sister-in-law of our trips just after she had seen ""Brokeback Mountain"". So you can guess the remarks we've gotten.  And I still owe all of this to agreeing to that original colonoscopy."
