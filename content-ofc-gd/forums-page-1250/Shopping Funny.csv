He pulls over to a toy store and asks the salesperson, ""How much is the Barbie on display in the front window?"" The salesperson answers, ""Which one? We have Work-Out Barbie for $19.95, Shopping Barbie for $19.95, Beach Barbie for $19.95, Disco Barbie for $19.95 and Divorced Barbie for $265.95."" The amazed father asks, ""What? Why is the Divorced Barbie $265.95 and the others only $19.95?"" The salesperson answers, ""Sir, Divorced Barbie comes with Ken's car, Ken's house, Ken's boat, Ken's furniture, Ken's computer and one of Ken's friends."""
