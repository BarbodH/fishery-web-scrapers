Is it determined by price? or is there one that will do it all, at a good price? I have a raincheck for the Garmin eTrex Summit. Any feedback re this one? Thanks in advance for your comments. bayboy"
48392,PatrickGG,2007-03-17 19:19:00,562,I had one and took it back it ain't to bad of a toy but the back roads and lakes software is almost 200 bucks.

48527,ryanheritage,2007-03-18 00:14:00,180,"which one did you get? I just recently got an etrex legend and yes the software for it is pricey but its software and if you know anyone good with computers ( downloading guys) you can get the info .. all of it for under 10.00 bucks...I love somoe bootleggers! It gona take a bit to gete used to but when you do get the hang of it you will find that it is a great tool for fishing, marking great spots on open water for ice fishing, getting back to ""spot"" or even just having a map at your fingertips. It is a learining process, but I think it will really help me out cause of how many different places I fish and how lost I get on the ice and open water. Now I need to get a decent fishfinder,, I know I could have got a all in one unit but having to seprate units dedicated to their own technology was a better idea for me and Iam not always fishing in my boat... Anyone know of a phenomanal fish finder for cheap???????????? like the 200.00 dollar range up or down but perferably down..lol"
