48864,motv8tr,2007-03-18 22:34:00,2587,"Not me, I already know how smart I'm not...don't need and IQ test to tell me that  Maureen"
48869,Bernie,2007-03-18 22:42:00,3190,Geez....not sure that I want to find out either. I just wanna go fishin'
48871,Dano,2007-03-18 22:45:00,719,"No, my last three tests were exactly the same, spaced out over 30 years. Guess beer doesnt make you dummer."
48894,Clampet,2007-03-18 23:32:00,1947,That scorecard doesn't appear to be useable.
48895,Gerritt,2007-03-18 23:34:00,6129,Works here and I printed it off etc... it is a PDF file meaning you need adobe acrobat installed.... go here for acrobat.. www.adobe.com   Gerritt.
48896,Clampet,2007-03-18 23:35:00,1947,Must buy printer.
48901,danc,2007-03-18 23:56:00,4677,"I'll stick with ""Deal, or no Deal"".  But thanks for the heads up Gerritt."
48902,Canuck2fan,2007-03-19 00:01:00,1444,I took the test online since it was so much quicker. At least I accurately predicted my I.Q. LOL
48907,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-19 00:18:00,0,"Hey I did it on the net, and I guessed I would get 120 and ended up with 117. I'm sure I missed at least 5 questions on time. Some questions I didn't get to read all the answers.  I guess I'm still above average."
48915,huntervasili,2007-03-19 00:31:00,1604,Awesome.... I had 1!!!! i guess i am the best in the country right?... Atleast I am with the national average of people though... how does someone get 100%???? lol
49015,GordieHowe,2007-03-19 07:39:00,4,"Geez, that was tougher/more fun than I expected it to be. Apparently, my language skills aren't so hot, and my memory sucks."
49027,huey graphite,2007-03-19 11:25:00,362,"  I believe the correct term is ""more stupid"" so the answer to that question would be yes!  (just kidding.....sorry couldn't resist   )"
49053,Garyv,2007-03-19 13:05:00,547,"Well not any smarter, nor any dumber....just slower!!!!!!!!!"
49070,ccmtcanada,2007-03-19 13:39:00,7971,Interesting test...I estimated 115 and got 118.  It was tougher than I thought it would be!
49116,pikehunter,2007-03-19 15:10:00,1659,"Geesh!!! You guys are a bunch of brainiacs!  I kinda feel like Hank on the TV show ""Corner Gas.""  I had a hard time trying to beat the clock on some of them and failed to answer on time. I faired in the average group of people."
49118,BITEME,2007-03-19 15:13:00,1969,guessed 120 got 115
49122,bullybass,2007-03-19 15:24:00,144,The wife and I played last night on TV. We actually had a good time playing. Sucked on the memory parts... gettin' old I guess... pulled off a 122... stupid memory questions brought me down... and who knew that baby lavalife needed attention paid to it... oh well fun nonetheless!!!
49151,Headhunter,2007-03-19 16:17:00,5703,"Well, I was gonna watch the show, but it was on at the same time as The Simpsons and.... well you know! Just took the quiz online, scored 135! Man, I thought I'd maybe break into the 90's but... think I'll ask for a raise!LOL HH"
49202,walleyejigger,2007-03-19 17:38:00,876,"didn't get to do it last night as i was working so i just took it, i said average (100) and scored 132, I""M A GENIUS, if only my high school advisor could see me know,  now if only i used my mind for good instead of evil.....mmmwwaaahahahahahahahah"
