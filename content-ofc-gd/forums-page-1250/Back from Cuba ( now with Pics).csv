48427,Mike the Pike,2007-03-17 21:18:00,3421,Crazyhook those beer cups are really small at NH Crystal so I figure you only had 63 regular size beer.Was the first shot of a bartender called Alain.I can't believe I could have been fishing last year.  Nice pics and tahnks for the report.
48441,mattyk,2007-03-17 21:42:00,2110,looks like a great trip. Thanks for sharing.
48449,GbayGiant,2007-03-17 21:56:00,1780,"I think your numbers on the beer were a little low, you could improve on that next time.  Nice pics and fish and gongrats on the fly cuda."
48467,Crazyhook,2007-03-17 22:29:00,1154," Dude I brought my own Mug!  Thats the bartender at the Flair bar named WIlber, he is ranked #4 in the World. Was a blast watching him make drinks..  I had a cuda pull the top part of my travel rod off and then the line broke, i headed into the lagoon to get it. Looks like 6"" of water but I was knee deep in mud and lost my sandals during the process"
48476,mepps,2007-03-17 22:51:00,1301,You look a little red in that last pic!
48495,Puckhead,2007-03-17 23:19:00,377,"Nice job bro!  Never had much interest in going to Cuba, but seeing that mess of fish gives me a new point of view!"
48611,Chris,2007-03-18 04:05:00,405,Welcome back paleface
48677,tjsa,2007-03-18 13:35:00,1578," LOL, you're a braver man than me Jamie, I wouldn't have gone into the water with fish that had chompers on them like those fish, never know what appendage might look like a meal to them.  Great pics and report."
48792,Crazyhook,2007-03-18 19:16:00,1154,"I went casting in the ocean as well with a big salt water X rap... went up to my neck while casting. ( I heard from many there was no sharks). got a follow from a mid 40"" cuda and that was it, back to the beach for me!"
48829,sirfish,2007-03-18 20:41:00,175,"Hey crazy hook , we were there last year for march break and had a blast. I was amazed at the variety of fish in those lagoons and how they slammed my lures. Looks loke you had a blast and that pic of the swim up looked all to familiar.. ...Did you notice how the water around those stools was always warmer."
48951,muskymatt,2007-03-19 01:34:00,2608,"Sweet looking holiday Jamie, looks like a lot of fun. Nice pics. Matt"

48263,Crazyhook,2007-03-17 12:24:00,1154," Got in last night from Cuba and had a great time. We stayed at the NH Krystal in Cayo Coco. Service was excellent food was food ( got to love lobster every day!) and the fishing was great as well. Beer was cold and the Sun was hot    I did not head out on a flats charter as planned as it was windy all week. Decided to hang around the resort and fish the differet Lagoons and flats there. Hooked two nice tarpon at night and both jumped and were free.  caught 35 cudas during my trip. 4 were over 10 pounds but most were small (1-4 pounds). Had one cuda get eaten by another as well... got broke off about 15 times too. I was fishing with a medium action spinning rod and 10 pound mono. Ran out of leaders and had to go au natural. Night time during the incoming tide provided the best action and produced the biggest fish including this 5 pound cubera snapper on a topwater storm bait .     I gave a go at fly fishing in the wind and caught my first cuda on the fly.. little guy but it fought great on my 8 weight  First Cuda on the fly ( ate a white deciever)   here are the numbers  35.5 Cudas, 15 bite offs, countless follows and topwater strikes 1 cuda on the fly ( few follows as well) 2 Cubera snappers 2 lost tarpon 1 lost lady fish 126 cold cuban beers 4 margaritas 1 awesome time  my daughter thought this cuda needed to plump up a bit and tried to feed it some bread  caught this little guy on my second cast right beside our room   who says snapper are bottom fish!?   average size cuda for the resort,   Glad to be home and can't wait to go back"
48265,Greencoachdog,2007-03-17 12:27:00,8163,Sounds like a great time!  Looking forward to the pics!
48266,Mike the Pike,2007-03-17 12:29:00,3421,Hey Cazyhook great to see you had a good time over there.I stayed at the same place last february with the wife.This was a freeby because I won the trip.Wish I had of brought my fishing gear like you.Can't wait to see the pics.
48272,joefish,2007-03-17 12:39:00,165,"And you got home in time to get snowed on!!!!!!!!!    I'm leaving tomorrow for the same area ( cayo coco ) , will also bring a rod and some tackle. What were you using if I may ask?"
48273,JEREMY,2007-03-17 12:41:00,300,"35.5 Cudas, 15 bite offs, countless follows and topwater strikes 1 cuda on the fly ( few follows as well) 2 Cubera snappers 2 lost tarpon 1 lost lady fish 126 cold cuban beers 4 margaritas 1 awesome time priceless for everything else theres matercard lol gladyou had a good time and welcome back to the cold."
48277,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-17 12:47:00,1351,sounds great ch.. welcome back to canada! over here its snowing in toronto..lol.. wish i can head over to cuba to fish.. maybe next year..
48278,taper,2007-03-17 12:55:00,611,"Cuba is a spot I would love to get to some day, mostly for the fishing."
48279,Crazyhook,2007-03-17 12:56:00,1154,"Joe where are you staying?  there are no places to by takle so stalk up now!  1/8 jighead with a white 3"" gulp minnow cast and retrieve very quickly. Even cast  in 6"" of water there are fish everywhere. I would buy 3 packs of that bait, I ran out on the second day.  For night time fishing get a storm topwater chugger in blue and silver ( get a few)  small rapalas worked for a friend I made down there, a casted out a huge storm plastic bait and it got torn in two on the second cast.  also bring small hooks and split shots. Make frinds with someone from the kitchen and they will give you shrimp which are gerat for bottom fish. if you need tips let me know!"
48281,Guidofisherman,2007-03-17 13:05:00,206,Sound like you had a great time. Were you ever able to get in contact with Orlando? I'm looking forward to the photos.
48285,Corey,2007-03-17 13:16:00,355,Did you have to purchase any type of license to fish down there?
