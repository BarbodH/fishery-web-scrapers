Cronzys version isn't nearly as good. We always ended up hearing ""The Wizard"" on fishing trips, so kind of adopted it as a trip song."

I third ""The Band"" and sure do like some Neil Young too.  For fishing like to keep it mellow.  The most often I'll listen to music while fishing is in the float tube, and so it needs to be slower tunes unless it's Zeppelin."
