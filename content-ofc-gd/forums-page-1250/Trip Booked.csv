46015,blaque,2007-03-12 14:51:00,2419,"Promiseland camp, Lake Nippissing, one week, end of May. Walleye are on the bill. Hopefully anyway. I havent been there in years and Im curious if anyone has any tips for techniques on the lake that time of year. Wont be keeping a ton of fish ( im aware of the slot ) but will probably do a fishfry a night or two.  Im used to slow trolling harnesses with bottom bouncers, or vertical jigging deerhair jigs tipped with bait,  casting suspending stickbaits in the evening for shallow feeders etc. Just wondering if anyone lends itself more to that particular lake at that time of year. Shes a big chunk of water! Im sure Frank at the camp will hook me up with some tips, but i gotta shop before hand so i have what i need. Any suggestions.  Thanks either way  Rob"
