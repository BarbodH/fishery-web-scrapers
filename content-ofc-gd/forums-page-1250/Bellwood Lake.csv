47783,sticky,2007-03-16 12:02:00,33,Has anybody caught anything big at Bellwood Lake in Fergus?  I've heard talk about trophy fish in there but all I've ever seen caught there where 1 lb pikes and 3-5 lb bass.
47868,steverowbotham,2007-03-16 15:46:00,1800,whats wrong with 3-5 pound bass ??
47874,Puckhead,2007-03-16 16:13:00,377,Ohhhhh my pride ---- My PB smallie is a hair over a 5lber
47904,jdmls,2007-03-16 17:22:00,575,I have been several times last year....got a good 10lb pike and several 1-2lb smallies....I fished at the south side of the lake by the first island just up from the Dam and really wasn't to impressed....The few times I fished from the bottom of the Dam from shore I got into some nice size smallies and lots of cats and carp.. I even pulled out one nice brown about a 1.5lbs..  Has anyone fished the top part of the lake ? I always wondered if it was worth venturing up...
48655,sticky,2007-03-18 12:09:00,33,oh nothing wrong with 3-5lbs at all....good catch definately.  Course those ones were the day pike season opened up.
48679,express168,2007-03-18 13:41:00,327,I have never caught any trophy fish out of Bellwood but I have always had good days on the water there. Remember it isn't always about the trophies.
48751,Marko,2007-03-18 17:50:00,854,Only fish that i caught at the Belwood lake were cats and really small trouts and pikes. usually there are  30 people fishing bellow the dam on both sides of the river and its just a headache.  I think they have a pike tournament on the lake every year and i hear they catch big ones.
