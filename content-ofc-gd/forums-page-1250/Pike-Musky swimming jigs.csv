I looked at their jig selection and I couldn't find a swimming jig to match?  They were too small.  I went to my local shop and they don't carry them either, but they would special order it for me.  Does anyone know who might carry this size (1 oz - 1 1/2 oz)?"
48745,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-03-18 17:31:00,135,I saw Pete Maina use it on his show on Red Lake in Minnesota.  They were haulin in some beauties and it looked like a lot of fun!

Going to seriously try the swimming jig (a la Doug Stange of IN-Fisherman method) and see what happens. The baits have a lot of appeal to me: single hook, size, depth and speed variability, etc. I hope they appeal to the fish as much."
