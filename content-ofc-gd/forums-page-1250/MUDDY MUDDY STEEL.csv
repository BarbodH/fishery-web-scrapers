48706,Puckhead,2007-03-18 15:15:00,377,Same here CC...  You know darn well these guys have some serious penis evny.  Keep those reports coming.  We all love them!  No matter what ity bitty peni thinks...
48715,xrap,2007-03-18 16:01:00,683,  LOL!!!
48735,majorlifts,2007-03-18 17:05:00,171,"I have some nice spots (you would have to guess where they are) with pics of nice steel, but they are to large to post. Any way around that?  We could have some fun with this. Sorta like Irishfield and the guess that area game, that was fun.  PS: Irishfield cracks me up."
48779,Squid,2007-03-18 19:01:00,1656,Scott keep up the great fishing bud. You are an asset to the family.
48639,lew,2007-03-18 10:05:00,12767,"CC, I'm not a river fisherman at all, just never had any real interest in it, but I always enjoy reading your posts and hafta admit, you've definetely got those fish dialed in. Your always helpful to the newbies and willing to share tactics that work and that's what it's all about around here.  After reading about your success and viewing your pictures, I was gonna take up river fishing, but darned if I could figure where your spot was from the photo's of the ice & snow  Keep doing what your doing Scott, and don't worry about a couple guys who figure they own the rivers."
47702,kemper,2007-03-16 03:30:00,2232,"DONT EVER STOP THE REPORTS CC! SEEING ALL THE CHROME YOU CATCH IS WHAT MOTIVATES ME TO KEEP GOING BACK TO THE RIVERS TO TANGLE WITH SOME STEEL!  I can deal with the caps, as long as there is some STEEL to go along with them!"
47704,ryanheritage,2007-03-16 03:36:00,180,Hey CC!  I am going to Duffins crk in ajax on sat ....would you mind sharing any tips with me? I have only ever once caught a steelie after many many many times of trying and I would love to get another. any tips at all for me? I have my 10.5 rod with 6lb mono and a 1000 series reel. I have alot of gear but no clue on how to actually catch a nice bow.  Im a river fishing poser.lol
47709,ryanheritage,2007-03-16 03:48:00,180,wow!!!! I just saw the posts by the eastern turdburglers...lol....  I can't believe someone or PLURAL people lol would have an issue with someone who is on here keeping everyones thirst for fishing quenched. I love seeing his posts and I enjoy seeing fish being caught and posted for CC's friends to see. Its unfortunate that them there eastern turdburglars can't give respect when its due. CC keep on posting pics and reports I look forward to them all the time. As fer the eastern turdburglars............ BE GONE!!! and may you catch nothing but beaver fever and bottom.   Got you eastern turd burglars a coffee!! no hard feelings 
47714,majorlifts,2007-03-16 04:19:00,171,"I like your drive CC, determination, and willingness to pound the pavement in search of steel. You should write a small book, paperback, called ""The Riddle Of Steel"", and tell all about your great adventures unraveling the riddle of steel. Every detail, because thats what keeps the reader reading.I would buy it. I always said, ""if I was as good at catchin steel as I was at catchin bass I would write a book.   Similar read would be Fly fishermans  Odyssey by Robert Mengel."
47717,majorlifts,2007-03-16 04:45:00,171,"Another quick reply, (sorry) but I have to say, Im really surprised by the responses of some of the others. I thought thats what this board was for. Trust me if your scared some newbie is gonna come out fish you in your spot, you should re evaluate your tackle, if you know what I mean. I fly fish most of the season, and there is so many tribs and rivers and systems connected to systems you would have to be a complete nob to worry about some guys taken your spot. And dont give me that crap about one day ya posted then the next day 5 guys were there on your spot. Ive been lifting Iron for many years now and in the first year I put on 50 lbs of hard core muscle and people always ask me how desperately they could make such gains, I tell them, and would you believe 99.9 times out of a hundred they do the same old crap that gets em nowhere. they want to but somehow never do.  My point is all that work you put in to the spot, they dont wanna do that, so 99.9 times outa 100 they will fail miserably. Trust me this still takes work well after the tip is given, and most people dont wanna work for anything.  Besides I would share secrets with many on this board, I think most people here are good people."
47867,Josh Rogers,2007-03-16 15:40:00,79,Yeah. Those guys are just jealous. Like CCMT said even new steelheaders know that when the ice is gone it's time to go fishing. Spots are gonna be crowded. There's not much you can do about it and who really cares? In my opinion the race to the spot is almost half the excitement of the fishing trip and if you don't get your spot there's always more water to be fished. So like everyone else said there are a lot of fish out there for everyone so go give her a shot.
47911,Canuck2fan,2007-03-16 17:46:00,1444,CC even with caps your reports are awesome and they don't EVER give away the really important details. I fish a little for chrome and I usually look forward to coming home after getting skunked and seeing your reports where you didn't. That GIVES me the incentive to go out and try again because I see it can be done with a little work.
47939,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-16 18:27:00,2050,"First off I can't believe I read all those posts! haha but seriously, CC's a good guy.....he's  given me some great tips and I honestly don't think I'd have ever gotten into steelheading if it wasn't for his stinkin' awesome reports!  Keep it up CC and I'm glad to see everybody backin' him up!  Good Steelheading..... UF  ps. i'm hitting the Credit River next weekend...SSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHH I don't think anybody knows about it!"
47456,canadian_copper,2007-03-15 16:26:00,925,"GOT OUT AT 5AM THIS MORN TO DO A TRIB CHECK!!! HIT 6 TRIBS AND ALL WERE TOTALLY UNFISHABLE!!! THOUGHT FOR A HOOT I'D CHECK  A PIER!!!

47490,kemper,2007-03-15 17:50:00,2232,"Nice CC, Ive been trying to find fishable waters all day and theres no way. I hit the Oshawa peir for about 20 minutes but was not dressed for it at all. All i caught today was to get my car really dirty and soak my feet.   You think it will be any better tomorrow?"
47498,ccmtcanada,2007-03-15 18:15:00,7971,"Great work Scott!!  Just when you think there's no way anyone can get some steelies, you go out and show us how it's done!"
47499,just2manylures,2007-03-15 18:16:00,144,Love the reports.  Nice Fish!!!
47500,xrap,2007-03-15 18:19:00,683,Way to show em up. Nice fish and report cc

47548,Dutch,2007-03-15 21:20:00,831,"WHY DO YOU TYPE ALL IN CAPS?  ARE YOU MAD AT EVERYONE?  I FIND IT VERY HARD TO READ, BUT THEN AGAIN IT WAS MY CHOICE TO READ THIS LINNNNNKKKKKKKKKKK!"
47587,camillj,2007-03-15 23:07:00,1988,Way to go Scott ... you beat me ... I went to the mouth of one trib around 6 am.... was chocolate soup ... so after a few drifts packed up and headed further east to the 'flow' you and I  fished last year ... found about eight guys there ... and only one fish ... spent a couple hours there and decided to take my chances walking the tribs ... packed it in by noon without so much as a sniff ... but then visibility was almost ZERO  Saturday or Sunday should be a blitz .... but then there will probably be 8 zillion guys ... so maybe next Tuesday or Wednesday is better
47590,canadian_copper,2007-03-15 23:09:00,925,FOR SURE BRO!!! DROP ME ALINE
47613,eastern steelheaders,2007-03-16 00:08:00,4," maybe his one eye has something to do with it  CC if you like gettin steel keep the mouth shut, your no pro bragging to a bunch of bass and walleye guys who dont river fish, I stand beside you as well as my buddies and always out fish you, no reason to brag.  BTW i think i seen a few of your pics from ff.net that you put up last year, why dont you visit that anymore?  THE EASTERN STEELHEADERS"
47625,ccmtcanada,2007-03-16 00:40:00,7971," Wow...nice first post.  CC is a classy guy...dont see why you felt the need to post this.  I am a Walleye guy who was looking to expand my fishing experience, and he helped me out...CC shares his experiences on here....shares tips and applauds other people who do well.  We never ask where his secret spots are and he doesn't post them publicly.  If that is not what ff.net was like, then I can see why he is here and not there."
47641,canadian_copper,2007-03-16 01:38:00,925,NO WORRIES !!! JUST ANOTHER CHICKEN WHO CANT SAY IT TO MY FACE!!! ITS TYPICAL IT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR!!! AND SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU THERE NOT LAST YRS PICS!!! IF YOU CAN OUT FISH ME THEN GREAT!!!! YOUR THE BEST THEN!!! I LEFT FF.NET FOR YOU PRO'S!!!
47649,Nater,2007-03-16 01:53:00,68,as my good buddy mark would say...Jesus Mary and Joseph!  It's nate here CC and I feel the same frustration as the guy who posted under eastern steelheaders.  Truth be known we have been fishing by ourselves since the weekend and posts like this are gonna bring out every yahoo around the GTA  Im sure we'll see you tommorow and I dont think that doing up reports here is the best thing to be doing this time of year it isnt all that fair to the rest of us who have put in the time busting out ice and trying to time it right when you do a report and you have everyone kneeling to you asking to take them out when most (no offence) are clueless  somethings are best kept quiet  Nate
47655,GbayGiant,2007-03-16 02:10:00,1780,"Hey fellas, I fished rivers from Collingwood to Wasaga up on Blue mountain and everything in between 3 days or more a week my whole life but stopped when I got up north, so there are some river guys here and CC is not the only one. Don't be mad cause he's out catching fish, and if he's taking out rookies from this site for free and teaching them how to catch some Chrome, than what's wrong with that ?  Let's see your pictures if you want to have a pissing contest. lol....jealous.  We like the reports around here, and he never specifies or shows the areas hes fishing, nobody owns the river. And why is it every river guy thinks there better than the next ? I use to get it from city guys that came up to Thornbury 10 years after I was fishing it, there is so many ways to find a spot, these posts from CC account for nothing of the fishing pressure. Think about it. If a guy wants to catch some chrome in the city area all he has to do is type ""Toronto fishing"" or whatever city or town into Google or go to the nearest bait shop or tackle store. And someone showed you the first time, right ? it's not like you guys were the Christopher Columbus of river fishing."
