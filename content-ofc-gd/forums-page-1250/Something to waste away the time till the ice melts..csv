48229,Bly,2007-03-17 04:20:00,1556,  Oh may the fish gods bless you with a World Record Musky!!!  Thank you sooo much!!  bly
48243,SlowPoke,2007-03-17 06:50:00,2984,Yep... you are very very close to finishing. Don't want to spoil it for you but if you're stumped PM me. -Brian
48375,wuchikubo,2007-03-17 17:52:00,1114,"Thanks Brian, I didn't notice it until you said there was somethingelse. Done!"
48376,Dutch,2007-03-17 17:58:00,831,"This is so frustrating, yet I can't stop...."
48570,pigeonfisher,2007-03-18 02:30:00,696,can't get the gold ball...how many combinations are there?  hhahaa
48580,pigeonfisher,2007-03-18 02:59:00,696,you gotta help me...I can't figure it out for the life of me.
48617,SlowPoke,2007-03-18 04:15:00,2984,The clue showing the scale with the gold ball is misleading... you don't actually get the gold ball out of the combination. The picture is to illustrate that there is more different about the balls than just colour. If you need a better clue PM me. -Brian
47913,tonyb,2007-03-16 17:49:00,1637,what light does the box go on?
47921,xrap,2007-03-16 18:04:00,683,"the light under the desk, but make sure u poke holes so the image transfers on the desk."
47925,tonyb,2007-03-16 18:10:00,1637,"Doh! I only had one hole poked on the shaded side of the box, thx"
47940,frozen-fire,2007-03-16 18:28:00,542,got it yesterday night....took forever with the balancing of the balls and figuring out what equals what.
48027,JEREMY,2007-03-16 20:36:00,300,I am still stuck on the animal wall thing anybody?And the boxand screwdriver no clue where to put the box.
48084,GbayGiant,2007-03-16 22:47:00,1780,It took a while considering I couldn't open all the locks with the screw driver.
48099,kemper,2007-03-16 23:21:00,2232,"I CANNOT FIGURE OUT THE DAMN ANIMAL BOX THING.  wow  Ive got a picture of a cat with a green border, a hand drawn red rabbit, and I see a blue butterfly under the table. Process of elim. on the last one will not work."
48100,wuchikubo,2007-03-16 23:23:00,1114,Is there anything else after the wall comes back after placing all the spheres correctly?
48112,tjsa,2007-03-16 23:35:00,1578,"I HATE YOU RICK!!!!!!!!!!! But, seriously, I do like this game, its challenging, frustrating, and gratifying, at the same time. These games have been around for a bit I am told by a co-worker, who has played them, he likes this one a lot, better graphics supposedly. I don't play internet games very much, but this one I like."
48128,GbayGiant,2007-03-17 00:27:00,1780, Use the crayon to color the page in the bottom book on the desk.
48144,bigfish1965,2007-03-17 01:01:00,3382,I've played games like this a few times and it is fun. Theres another good one and I'll see if I can find it. This one took me probably 3 hours altogether.
48161,stasbrute,2007-03-17 01:36:00,206,crayon what crayon????? argggg
48178,stasbrute,2007-03-17 02:15:00,206,I guess I dumb cant get past the animal thing on the wall ...........
48184,dobber1978,2007-03-17 02:35:00,13,Whats with the flower picture on the wall
48185,dobber1978,2007-03-17 02:38:00,13,"yeah,  Ok, got a couple keys, screwdriver, cup, code, marbles, cane, can't figure out the animal code, have green border on my cats, blue butterfly, pink rabbit, ????"
48188,GbayGiant,2007-03-17 02:40:00,1780,The crayon is under the couch.
48190,GbayGiant,2007-03-17 02:43:00,1780,"I just tried to play it again to see how fast I could do it once you know everything, and this time it wouldn't give me the key from the wall either, so I think there's a glitch going on for some people ? It worked the first time I played and not the second."
48192,Bly,2007-03-17 02:48:00,1556,"  oh thank you!!  I tried and tried this morning to get the wall thing to work, then I started a whole new game this afternoon thinking that I did something wrong and it still wouldn't let me get pass the wall.  Guess I will just try and load another new one....thanks again...thought I was nutz..of course I still could be but that is for another post! lol  bly"
48216,SlowPoke,2007-03-17 03:46:00,2984,"my wife and I are playing on two computers... codes were different. We're both stuck on the ball code in the wall and we need the gold ball for the scale. Is there a hint within the game for the ball code combination?     nevermind, figured it out.... duh."
48220,Bly,2007-03-17 03:54:00,1556,"ok, I have tried this thing 4 times now and on 2 different computers....I normally and not one to cheat but I also have trouble just walking away lol and I have to drive to MI in the am and I just know this thing is going to keep me awake...help!  I am at the wall with the animal code thing...can't figure out what I am doing wrong....I know the code is different every time....I have orange bunny  (drawing from drawer) green cat  (picture under table) pink butterfly (box/light) blue flower  (book & crayon)  also have  paper with box code crayon hook thing screwdriver screws brown dirt thing glass box 3 white balls 2 green 1 grey 1 red  am I missing something and is there anything with the flower picture on the wall ?? thanks!  bly"
48221,SlowPoke,2007-03-17 04:02:00,2984,After setting the animal codes did you press the button to open the drawer?
48222,Bly,2007-03-17 04:03:00,1556,  pressed the button and the drawer opens...nothing there  bly
48225,xrap,2007-03-17 04:15:00,683," Yes, you need to fill the cup up with water then put the dirt in. Then you rinse off the frog in the cup and then zoom in on him at the flower picture."
48226,Bly,2007-03-17 04:17:00,1556,  thanks for the heads up on the frog and flower picture but I still cannot seem to get the key tothe door from the animal code thing in the wall
48227,SlowPoke,2007-03-17 04:17:00,2984,You might have done the same thing I did... I thought it was a picture of a bunny but its a duck. Change your orange bunny to match the duck picture.
47746,frozen-fire,2007-03-16 06:08:00,542,i opened the door!  this thing is tricky...animal coding on the wall took me forever
47747,xrap,2007-03-16 06:12:00,683,how do you solve the number box in the washroom?
47748,frozen-fire,2007-03-16 06:19:00,542,"no idea...i did however fill the glass with water, but i can't pour it anywhere...  also...i thought that the balls were supposed to go into the balance thingy with 3 spaces on each...nothing seems to work...i tried screwing it in, but didn't work haha"
47749,xrap,2007-03-16 06:22:00,683,"Think u gotta find balls of each coulor i got all of them except one more gray one. Anyone know whats up with the flower, there pissing me off"
47750,frozen-fire,2007-03-16 06:30:00,542,i only have one red one... where'd you find the other two?
47751,xrap,2007-03-16 06:34:00,683,red? mine are greeen gray and white
47752,frozen-fire,2007-03-16 06:39:00,542,"3 white, 2 gray, 3 green and 1 red  check behind the plant pot on the floor...theres a vent that you can unscrew...i think i got the red ball in there."
47753,frozen-fire,2007-03-16 06:42:00,542,okay...screwed in the right side of the balance thingy....playing with what kind of combination of balls to use.
47754,Hooked,2007-03-16 06:47:00,891,"This is funny, last time I checked this, there was only my post, now 32!  On top of that, tons of hints, thx boys, too bad I'm crazy tired now."
47755,frozen-fire,2007-03-16 06:52:00,542,yeah...it's starting to kill my eyes
47756,frozen-fire,2007-03-16 07:02:00,542,"okay, finally got the code for the washroom box... turns out we need a gold ball now... omg...i want to go to sleep...but i wanna finish this!"
47824,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-16 13:45:00,0,"Ok I have no clue where to find the numbers for the bathroom box. I have a piece of paper semi rolled and a brown funny shaped one as well as a long hook thing I'm at a loss for what they are for. What to do with the Glass of water?  Anyone know what balls go where on the scale?  This has been fun but getting frustrating as i believe I've clicked on everyhting but I need that last key to see what in that drawer.  Update: OK I found a red ball in the hangning plant with the hook, and I managed to fit that brown thing in the glass of water. I guess it's not tea as I can't get it in the coffee cup.  2 of the books on the table helped to find the first code but what's with the frog?"
47837,Joey,2007-03-16 14:14:00,9122,I  can't poke a hole in the box with the screwdriver?  What am I doing wrong?  Joey
47840,Jacques,2007-03-16 14:37:00,97,Ahahahaha!  I did it!  Damn you for that that time-sucking post.
47844,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-16 14:54:00,0, Hints pls!!!!!!!
47845,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-16 14:56:00,0," You need to click the magnifying glass to bring out the box, click the box to flip it then poke it with the screwdriver. Big hole on the grey side and small hole on the opposite side."
47846,Jacques,2007-03-16 14:58:00,97,"The frog picture clue is key.  Are you in the bathroom?  Earth + Water + The Glass go together.  Mix 'em up and then see what you get when you rinse the glass out again.  Then take note of where the Frog ends up in the picture...  Once you're in the bathroom, you'll need to moisten the toilet paper...  anywhere in the room that seems a little dirty?  Get cleaning!"
47860,Joey,2007-03-16 15:22:00,9122,"Hmmmm, thanks Trophymuskie.  But after I did that it only shows a green butterfly and nothing else.  I tried the colour combo you showed before, and that doens't work either.  Frustrating.  Joey"
47863,xrap,2007-03-16 15:28:00,683,I rinsed the glass and nothing happened i don't get the clue with the frog in the book and the flowers and can't opent he code box in the washroom any help?
47864,xrap,2007-03-16 15:29:00,683,nvm got it
47865,xrap,2007-03-16 15:31:00,683,"I'm missing two balls and guessing thier the red ones, i still need to open the box in the washroom any clue on getting the dam number"
47866,Jacques,2007-03-16 15:35:00,97,Joey --  I think the colours on the washroom key box change by the game...  Xrap -- Try using the wet toilet paper to clean the smudge on the side of the plant pot.
47872,xrap,2007-03-16 15:59:00,683,wooooot did it
47873,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-16 16:10:00,0,"wow I thought I had made tea LOL never imagined I was washing off a frog. Once I found the frog it got easy. I knew where to put it and i had already found all the balls and figured which weighed more then the others so the final puzzle was a breeze.  I had a lot of fun, now without help I may of been at this for a long time.  Any more of these things out there? This is a great way to get the mind working."
47878,xrap,2007-03-16 16:18:00,683,whipe the smudge off find all the balls and put them in place

47728,kemper,2007-03-16 05:30:00,2232,"I cant explain it, its somewher near the big tree but I cant find it again.  Where is this code you speak of?"
47729,xrap,2007-03-16 05:32:00,683,when ur at the desk click the right side of it so u can see under there';s a piece of trash paper and it has the code on it
47730,kemper,2007-03-16 05:33:00,2232,AHH  beauty

47735,oldschool,2007-03-16 05:37:00,38,"Truly, there is simply not enough time in all eternity to continue with this excruciating example of futility.  But it was kind of fun.  Back to watching the infinitely more rewarding opportunity of watching paint dry."
47736,kemper,2007-03-16 05:40:00,2232,"Found the thing I was talking about, click on the hanging plant, then click on the outline of a box in the bottom left corner of the screen"
