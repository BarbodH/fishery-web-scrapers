48833,tjsa,2007-03-18 20:57:00,1578,"LOL, Glen, are you actually holding a fish, or are you putting your hand in front of a fish screen print on your sweater??????? Thats the way it looks in the picture anyways, but I do know you are holding a fish, cause I know you are fishing alone, and have seen a pic of the sweater before. No way you could stage that properly by yourself.  Good going btw."
48835,Jen,2007-03-18 21:04:00,833,That is a wonderful picture. Thanks for posting... nice to see someone has good weather.  Cheers Jen
48836,Clampet,2007-03-18 21:05:00,1947,Nice Picture Glen.
48854,Bernie,2007-03-18 22:13:00,3190,Hey Glen. You look a lot younger with your glasses off.   Maybe next time you can measure your fish in metric. Makes them seem a little bigger. Love the pics. Wish I was there fishin' with ya.
48867,motv8tr,2007-03-18 22:40:00,2587,"Good stuff Glen, nice to see some softwater reports.  Maureen"
48875,pikehunter,2007-03-18 22:49:00,1659,Nice Crappie Glen  But I didn't recognize you at first with a shirt and jacket on
48878,ccmtcanada,2007-03-18 22:53:00,7971,Nice report Glen!  Soft water without wearing 4 layers of clothing...I'm jealous....LOL
48880,Joey,2007-03-18 22:59:00,9122," Hahahaha, does it ever look like that.  Maybe he has two sweaters, but you'd think he'd have a larger fish picture on the sweater for all those takes with the camera he'd have to make.  Looks like a beauty day compared to here G.  And you got fish  Joey"
48908,Mike the Pike,2007-03-19 00:20:00,3421,"Well thanks for showing us your Red Neck face Glen.  So you really look your age  Happy belated Birthday March 15th 25 years old .So young, the sun really brings out the grey in your beard.  Man I am jealous can not legally fish until Late April.Nice pics keep them coming.  Yes you look as blind as me without Glasses. Like tjsa said that fish looks like it is printed on your sweater.  MTP"
49030,Whopper,2007-03-19 11:32:00,2174,WTG Dawg! I was hoping the fence would keep ya tied up a little longer so I could beat ya to a soft water report. Congrats for getting out and catching a few!  Whopper  PS. pikehunter don't encourage him
49034,bpsbassman,2007-03-19 11:50:00,941,Nice to see soft water Glen (guess you never see it hard though). What kind of rod holder rig is that behind you? Nice carpet job too
49039,lew,2007-03-19 12:12:00,12767,"Thanks Glen, we haven't seen too many softwater pics around here lately.  Our turn is comin soon though"
