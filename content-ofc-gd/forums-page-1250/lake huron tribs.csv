Went to a second trib barely no water still all iced up tried my luck for a few hours not even a nudge.  Well i tried to get a bow on the board for team 10  we'll need some warmer weather before things get going the whole lake is still ice as far as you can see.

They did clear up a bit today...about 7 to 8 inches of vis, but I had the little one and didn't fish.  Maybe I'll try my luck at some night drifting tonite.  Good luck your next time out!"
