48203,ryanheritage,2007-03-17 03:23:00,180,"A windtunnel ""O"" fun?!?!?!?!? I gotta try it out!!!!!!!!!! Its one of those things where tons of mental ideas comes into my head. I could find out if my fiance's chiaua can fly!! But seriously when no one's watching .... what do you do with a windtunnel ""O"" fun?"
48237,Northhunter,2007-03-17 05:39:00,214, Heh. I bet someone's got some stories they can't tell. I know I would
48253,Big Cliff,2007-03-17 11:46:00,6899,"I spent a lot of hours researching all sorts of deer repellents including several types desigined to go on your car. Save your money, they don't work!!!!  As far as the wind tunnle is concerned, not quite the same but...... (I don't know if this is true or not)  While testing the nose cones on some aircraft to see how they would stand up to bird impacts, someone came up with the bright idea of propelling the bird at the nose of the aircraft so they could study the results so they built a ""chicken canon"" (sort of like the one on Canadian Air Farce)  It was working well until some animal rights types got involved and they had to stop using live chickens. So someone went to the supermarket and bought some frozen ones. Problem, These were real aircraft nose cones on real airplanes that they were testing on and frozen chickens act very differently on impact than unfrozen ones. Yup, right through the nose cone and took out a whole bunch of electronics.  Thawed chickens apparently worked much better until one day, someone loaded the canon and they all went to lunch, when they came back they decided it was time to fire the canon.... seems that one of the cats that hung around the hanger had decided to have lunch too. From what I understand, it wasn't a very nice sight!"
48947,icedude,2007-03-19 01:26:00,459,"from personal experience-don't think they work worth a damn--got hit by a deer--not a school of deer mind you-on Smith Blvd in Egypt On--go ahead laugh--4K damage to my ride a few months back-the insurance company gave me a brand new loaner for 2 weeks--sweet!  from where i sit the deer whistle thing is a myth!  Yours in fishing, ID1"
49089,Gary George,2007-03-19 14:12:00,33,"Not to say that Deer Whistles do or don't work but think about this.  I have never caught a fish using a Swedish Pimple or a Red Devil. I am sure anyone here can make the same claim about virtually any lure you can think of. As well anyone here has one lure at least that never seems to fail them but no one else thinks is worth a dam.  I have never hit a deer and have never had ""whistles"". Everybody in my neighborhood has hit deer or been hit by deer at some time.  I have had more than a few fish slam the side of my boat or canoe or kayak. Never had any fish whistles on them.  We're talking about animals who's thoughts or rather instinctive responses we only understand thru the filter of our own perpective. So really it's pretty tough to say definitively that something like this works or doesn't.  Look at the different results between hatchery fish and wild fish in studies. Studying animal response can be as real or unreal as reality television. Once you point a camera at something it begins to act differently. There is a huge world of study on how studies affect behaviour.  Hatchery Deer would come to a whistle just like dogs do. Have you ever seen a bird sitting on a scarecrow?"
47773,SBCregal,2007-03-16 11:17:00,688,"Has anyone used one of those deer whistles that you put on your car? supposed to help avoid accidents and what not?  I plan on driving from Oakville through northern Ontario and out to Calgary around the middle-end of April, and quite obviously would like to do what I can to avoid hitting anything big   Other than paying attention and driving properly does anyone here have any tips on avoiding an unfortunate event like that?  Also going to avoid driving at dawn/dusk as much as possible.  Thanks guys and gals   Ryan"
47775,OhioFisherman,2007-03-16 11:23:00,6623,"A lot of guys had them on the Tractor trailers at work, mixed results."
47781,aplumma,2007-03-16 11:53:00,6896,One of the ways you get a deer to stop running and pause is to whistle at them. It might have the same effect  when they are crossing the road. The best advise is to brake as much as you can and still be under control and steer for the rearend of the deer. Dusk to dawn are also high traffic times for deer movement.  Art
47784,motv8tr,2007-03-16 12:10:00,2587,"I had them on my old car, never saw a deer, don't have them on the car I'm driving now and I've had a couple of close call now.  Do they work?  i don't know, but for the minimal cost of them...I'd use them if I could find the ones I had again.  Maureen"
47789,David Chong,2007-03-16 12:23:00,836,"I've had them on various vehicles and not on others! Never had a problem with the vehicles that had them, had a couple of close calls on the ones that didn't. Not sure if the whistles were the difference but for the cost of them why not? I have them on my current vehicle! Dave"
47794,SBCregal,2007-03-16 12:42:00,688,wow...thanks for the quick replies.  I'm pretty sure I'll pick one of them up.  Are they available at CT stores...or would I find them somewhere like BPS?  Ryan
47795,bigfish1965,2007-03-16 12:43:00,3382,These were tested and found to have no effect on deer whatsoever. I read the report (forget who did it) and they actually were found to antagonize Elk and not detract them.
47797,bigfish1965,2007-03-16 12:48:00,3382,
47800,just2manylures,2007-03-16 12:54:00,144,"Never heard of these things before.  Sounds pretty cool.  Driving to work the other day I saw a big ""school"" of deer in the feild."
47808,Bob,2007-03-16 13:10:00,370,They sell them in the 7/11 stores here.  Don't know if I'd want one on my vehicle during Bullwinkle's rutting season.  I've never used them but I know a couple of folks that would never use one again.  Guess why? Aunt Peg says Hello Ryan.
47819,Burtess,2007-03-16 13:29:00,901,"Just make sure you mount them the proper way, if you mount them backwards they will attract the deer to your car.                           LOL, just kidding, I have read a couple studies on these as well and they have supported the claim that they have no effect....  Burt"
47823,Joey,2007-03-16 13:45:00,9122,"I've never heard of the deer whistle.  I have heard of these shoorue but krikey, I don't live in Australia.  Joey"
47843,PatrickGG,2007-03-16 14:49:00,562,"Just stick a pair of antlers on the front of you car i am pretty sure that will stop any damage to your vehicle if you hit one. ""JK"""
47877,Northhunter,2007-03-16 16:16:00,214,"They don't work for skunks  We put a couple on the vehicle we took to Red Lake last fall. On the entire trip up (almost 24hrs driving), we saw one mammal. It was a black and white stinky sot, and we hit it  We did see a couple whitetails one night on the drive back, they were off the side of the road watching us go by.   Southern Ont. to Calgary is a long drive. They're cheap - throw a couple on and let us know how you make out. I know one report from 7 years ago won't stop me from trying them again."
47879,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-16 16:22:00,4399,  A big school of deer what were they doing spawning?
47880,verno,2007-03-16 16:29:00,178,"I think it was a previous thread here at OFC where someone was saying that if you drive fast enough to make the whistle work, the engine noise will drown out the whistle"
47893,ryanheritage,2007-03-16 17:02:00,180,"I think that deer whisltes are stupid. Most animals are curious.......... ""Hey Buck! you hear that whislting?""  Yeah Doe I do!!"" Well buck lets go check it out!"" "" but it might be a car!"" "" Doe..... Cars don't whistle...C'mon lets check it out>>>>  I know thats not what happends but I mean really... a whistle from the wind? that means when the winds a whistleing the deer are freaking out!! lol  Sorry for the stupidness BUT IT FRIDAY!!!!!!!!"
47916,Roy,2007-03-16 17:57:00,13728,They are absolutely useless. Do some research on any of the browsers.
48087,Gary George,2007-03-16 22:54:00,33,"A bit of logic would tell you that more noise can't be bad.  Of course tractor trailers make a pile of noise and they hit deer as often as anything.  For a couple ""Bucks"" it sure as hell won't lead to you hitting more deer."
48093,Daplumma,2007-03-16 23:08:00,1961,Been proven wrong many times.The last I heard was the sound does not reach the deer before the car at highwayspeeds..they may hear it as you go by though. Joe
48101,pikehunter,2007-03-16 23:23:00,1659,"I read a report in a magazine years ago that said they didn't work. The article also said that what good would they be anyway as any noise made by them would be downwind of the vehicle with them. Any noise, whether audible or inaudible to humans created by the whistles would be heard behind you, not in front of you.  So then maybe this theory is telling us to drive behind cars that have them to be safe?"
48105,tjsa,2007-03-16 23:30:00,1578,"A physics professor, who has a wind tunnel at my local university workplace, was also asked to evaluate them. Conclusion, after a month of testing........................................................NADA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No audible responses could be sufficiently discerned from them, at varying wind speeds, and he tested a few brands. Go ahead and believe your own personal experiences with them if you want, the science does not support it."
48116,Daplumma,2007-03-16 23:46:00,1961,Dude..you have a wind tunnel at work???Why would  you ever go home???There are so many things I would like to test in a wind tunnel.What is the top speed of this tunnel?How soon can I come visit you?Will they let my golf cart over the border without papers?Are chickens considered contraband there?Inquiring minds want to know... Joe
48120,kemper,2007-03-17 00:17:00,2232,"What is it about wind tunnels that interests guy...  OH YA, we get to imagine throwing different objects in and seeing them smash against a wall at a high rate of speed. AND we can even research how to make our golfcart more aerodynamic!  I love it!"
48123,irishfield,2007-03-17 00:20:00,26272,I could use one...about 40 feet x 40 feet please.....
