48364,TennesseeGuy,2007-03-17 17:31:00,957,"Beatrice and I were the only humans on Little Vermilion Lake for most of the week.  Sometimes Bea is a dog. We had spent a long day on the water and were picking up a few walleyes in Surprise Bay, just across the lake from camp.     Bea likes for me to fish with the sonar signal on so she can tell when we're over fish.  We were definitely over fish and she anticipated seeing my rod bend.  That's the signal for her to go crazy until a fish is boated.  When releasing a fish I must hold her collar with one hand and release the fish with my other hand or she'll be overboard. Bringing a wet dog into my boat in October isn't fun.     Minutes later Brett approached in his Beaver, came by to say hello and to let me know to bring in a couple of extra walleyes for the evening meal.  I got one photo and was set to take another when he reached our boat, but as he got closer Bea was frightened and tried climbing up my face.  No picture.     We had a great meal of fried walleyes washed down by the appropriate fluid.  Bea and I stayed a few more days until moose hunters came in.  We had the plane to ourselves back to Red Lake and then hit the road in our van for the 1465 mile ride to Tennessee.  Leaving the north country on the final day of the final trip of the year is a sad experiece."

48422,pikehunter,2007-03-17 21:10:00,1659,"Nice pictures!   Don't you just hate that last few minutes of the ride home. You know, just as you are ariving around the corner and your heart sinks low in your chest upon the realization that this is really the end.  For us it's coming down the 400 and seeing Toronto's buildings down the road. If we are coming back from Owen Sound or Sauble Beach it's when we come down #6 HWY and just come over the crest of the Niagara Escarpment and see Hamilton down below.  It's so depressing to see the city ahead."

48469,OhioFisherman,2007-03-17 22:30:00,6623,Great pictures Connie!
48482,TennesseeGuy,2007-03-17 23:03:00,957,"Thanks for the kind words guys.  Actually the scenery was great and hard for this point and shooter to mess up.  It was the kind of October trip that carries me through until the next May outing.  grt1, it's jig, jig, click, jig, jig, click and sometime it works."
