48750,silveradosheriff,2007-03-18 17:48:00,1025,Waiting impatiently to drown some lures!!!      
48755,keram,2007-03-18 18:04:00,585," Blind ???????    I do not thing so, but you can definitely hurt your hand I hope you have some good cutters and first aid kit"
48757,tjsa,2007-03-18 18:10:00,1578,"Ummmmm............................................bites tongue,"
48767,SlowPoke,2007-03-18 18:33:00,2984,"Glad I'm not the only tackle geek around here. My ""Brother P-Touch"" label maker got a workout this off-season too. Sure makes life easy picking boxes for an outing. I need a muskie storage solution, those Plano 3700 boxes are too small. I will probably get a Special-Mate for my trolling spoons too leaving the SlowPoke Tackle CasketÂ© home to all the other species.  "
48771,mason05,2007-03-18 18:42:00,258,Wow Dude!  Impressive. Does your old lady know you've got that much tackle?
48774,silveradosheriff,2007-03-18 18:48:00,1025,Know? - heck she keeps buying more!
48801,ryanheritage,2007-03-18 19:45:00,180,wow!!! my missus thought I was obsessed until I showed her your boxes of tackle and how their labeled... Thanks now I am off the hook with her and her saying Im obessed lol
48812,tjsa,2007-03-18 20:08:00,1578,"LOL, I just looked at that picture again, and all of those boxes ALONE, without being filled, would be my tackle budget for the summer."
48814,silveradosheriff,2007-03-18 20:17:00,1025,Well Bookoobeast - I'm glad I could be of some help. It is a bit more anal than it appears as each of the boxes is also labelled on both sides for use of viewing.  :-)
48920,Rich Clemens,2007-03-19 00:38:00,3131,I'm glad I don't have to help ya pack.  I ain't got half that many lures and get a headache trying to decide which ones to pack for each trip.
48930,Pigeontroller,2007-03-19 00:49:00,2793,"Never, ever, tell your Wife how much you spend on fishing gear!"
48959,silveradosheriff,2007-03-19 02:00:00,1025,The line I like is....  My worst fear is that when I die my wife will sell all my tackle for what I told her I paid for it.   Doh!  
48983,PatrickGG,2007-03-19 03:22:00,562,"Man i got the itch badly i was cleaning the blades on my spinnerbaits and adding trailer hooks to them also and sharpening up hooks and just going through my tackle 3 days in a row, i checked out the long term forecast and Thursday we are suppose to hit a high of 15 looks like the weather is going to look nice and what perfect timing pike will be closing soon and i need to break this itch."
49013,Bassman27,2007-03-19 06:44:00,98,Here's some of my obsession....lol      
49014,Bassman27,2007-03-19 06:46:00,98,Some more
