Other than a busted knuckle here and there ... anyone try or regularly do so?  Just wondering what power rods and line setup works best without feeling like you're draggng them up on a dull fiberglass stick.  Thanks in advance, Mark"

837926,dwc67,2014-02-23 13:49:00,140,"mooching rod are slow action long rods. so a laker would be a pretty dull fight because there would be no screaming runs and power shakes like salmon.  i would run a short light rigger rod with fast action like a 7foot light talora with braid line to feel the head shakes ,so you almost feel over powered."

I use it for everything, salmon, lakers, whatever.  I run the same stuff I run on my Diawa Sealines, 20lb Trilene Big Game.  Sounds identical to my rig. Same reel, I used to build a lot of rods back then, the Fenwick blank I used was one of their "" Fenglass"" high modulus fiberglass sticks , the numbers on the  blank were 1262 and it was a medium/ slower action. I beleve Lamiglass still make a similar blank in their high modulus S-Glass series if you want to go that route."
