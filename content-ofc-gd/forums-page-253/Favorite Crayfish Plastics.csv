838167,Acountdeleted,2014-02-24 18:04:00,2562,This is kinda a funny story but when I was a kid and a fish or rock or heavy pile of weeds would break my line and I'd loose my crayfish coloured Big O I would cry because it meant I had to use some orher terrible lure until I could buy a new one.
838220,porkpie,2014-02-24 22:13:00,2521,"Big O's are an amazing lure.  Funny you should mention it, I got my first big O off of a snag when I was wading a river for smallmouth when I was 14 or 15, It was a chartreuse big O, and I still have that lure today.  It is one that has never been sacrificed to the fish gods (by me anyway).  I now have a box full of them!  They are probably my number 1 bass crank, and I have inadvertently landed many pickerel, musky, crappie etc. on them as well!"
838236,d_paluch,2014-02-25 00:43:00,343,"http://www.anglerschoice.ca/  Also, check out there Wart Hawgs in 6"" size if you like fishing wacky. Unbelievable bait for me. My new favourite plastic. That picture on the site with the quick review is me on Simcoe. Highly recommend them and they are SO much durable than the senkos!"
838370,Acountdeleted,2014-02-25 18:43:00,2562,"At my parents cottage it is only about 15 feet deep at the deepest and packed with Milfoil thick enough to stand on. The depth the Big O runs is perfect to keep the lure right in the strike zone. Beginning of the year too, when the milfoil is still growing, it skims right over the top without getting hung up."
838390,mattaw,2014-02-25 20:55:00,162,"On the big O, any other colors than craw work well for you guys, Never used them before, I may have to go pick up a few... and by a few......"

838433,Canuck2fan,2014-02-26 01:23:00,1444,"I have never used any crayfish imitation baits.  Is that because you live in real province where you can still use REAL LIVE ones?  I quit bass fishing when they banned transporting crayfish over land in Ontario. Honestly I miss catching the crayfish more than the bass. Catching the crayfish took skill the bass not at all, once you knew the trick for the quarry I used to fish LOL."

838684,BillsTheBassMan,2014-02-27 04:39:00,932,"I think what this thread has shown is that a lot of quality fishermen use a lot of different lures to catch the same fish.  Sale hunt, try different profiles/rigs/colours and you'll find what works where & when.  It's more about how you fish the bait.  Most people new to soft plastics fish them way too fast or pop them way too much."

I have been using soft plastics forever, just haven't really had early success craw ones, so I focused on what produced, but go curious.  Fishing for me is great because it is always changing, things aren't set in stone.  You guys are awesome, and the variety shown in terms of what people prefer is really eye opening. Thanks"

For colours I usually stick to my pumpkins and watermelons, but I also like my blues and purples.  every one has a go to bait but these soft plastic craws are definitely mine."

838032,Big Cliff,2014-02-23 22:38:00,6899,"My favorite ""craw type"" bait isn't a plastic at all, it is a bucktail jig. Color depends on a lot of factors so a selection of colors and weights is esential but I have a few favorites."

I don't even use any others now. Has to be the crazylegs version though, i bought chigger craws on accident onetime, same color, and my success went way down. I should also add that its not only smallies that love em, walleye do to and 3 of my biggest pike came on these plastics. For pike and bass its usually on a weightless, or lighly weighted wide gap hook, for walleye its on a shakeyhead jig(i like northlands), and small round head jigs for panfish but i cut off the bottom 2/3 of the plastic"
