838355,Entropy,2014-02-25 17:53:00,747,"I am trying to find an article about why we hunt.   I think it may have been by a guy who was called Mahoney (?) perhaps not. It basically was outlineing our spiritual need to hunt, and explains that it is more than just killing.   Can anyone direct me to this?   I have tried google’n this but I have not the time to explore page after page of results. I was hoping someone here would know what I’m refering to (or something similar) and directing me to it quicker.   Thanks for you help.   Entropy  "

838489,bigugli,2014-02-26 13:20:00,6138,That was a good read. It sums up much that was a part of my upbringing
838491,akaShag,2014-02-26 13:44:00,2073,I didn't evolve through generations of successful hunters to be at the top of the food chain and then deny my lineage by eating tofu............
