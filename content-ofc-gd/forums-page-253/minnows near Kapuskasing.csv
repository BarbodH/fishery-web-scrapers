838622,bobowski,2014-02-27 00:47:00,360,Hey guys. I'm heading up to kapuskasing at midnight tonight and I was just informed that the guy in Kap that usually has minnows doesn't have any right now. I know its last minute but does anyone know of any places that have minnows near kapuskasing. We are driving overnight so it would have to be somewhere near there because of the time. Any help would be great. Thanks
