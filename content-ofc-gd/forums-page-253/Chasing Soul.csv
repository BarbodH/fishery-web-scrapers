Internet photography 101.  you on the other hand don't concern yourself with inflated hero shots....rather, the nature and beauty of fishing becomes primary...  as such, the way you approach a photo puts you in a league of your own.  That's exactly what I was gunna say!!"
838180,TDunn,2014-02-24 19:20:00,680,"Ummm, wow! Incredible pictures! Your very talented Mike!"

838256,MJL,2014-02-25 02:02:00,2427,"Thanks guys. Glad you liked the pics  They were the most challenging pics I've ever tried to take.   Too much lake trout in these pics. Needs whitefish.... and ling  And where was my invite when you went for ling? LOL  All I remember is Vic pulling the ling out from the cooler and seeing a trail of snotty goo attached to the beer  so many concern themselves with wide angle lenses, hiding hands, and sticking fish directly infront of the camera - oh, and of course looking at the ""fish"" instead of the ""camera"".

838063,MJL,2014-02-24 01:50:00,2427,"Winter - It's a love or hate affair for most. There's not many people who enjoy fishing outside in negative 20 degrees, or braving 60km/hr winds on the open ice. You can tell non-anglers or fair weather anglers you walk kilometres out onto a frozen lake, pulling a heavy sled full of gear and they won't understand why. You drill holes through ice a couple feet thick and continue till you find the promise land.  At work, my co-workers think I'm crazy for ice fishing without a hut in -25 degrees (even though I own a portable flip over). My fishing buddies think I'm crazy for lugging all my camera gear with me. When you do what you love, you'll love what you do even when the conditions suck - Especially when you gotta work 6 days a week during winter   For those in the know, ""chasing lakers"" has 2 meanings...It's what I do in winter. And it's what I search for in winter...  Seek & ye shall find...
