She said new breasts, I asked how much? 4 grand she said. I said no problem sweetheart, only one thing, I can only afford one this year and one next year.  "
838730,206,2014-02-27 14:42:00,563,Lowrance...Nuff said.  
838778,MrSimon,2014-02-27 17:32:00,217,"Really enjoying the HB 898HD SI I picked up last season, especially paired with I-Pilot Link...   Boat control on a whole different level. That is the exact same setup I run .... couldn't be happier!!"
838437,fishnguy,2014-02-26 01:43:00,96,"Looking at getting an upgraded fishfinder on the new boat I'll be looking to buy.  If you could have any fishfinder on the market, which would it be and why?  I've got a couple in mind, but curious what people will suggest.  Thx"
838451,fishnguy,2014-02-26 02:38:00,96,Should probably add that I'm looking for one with a GDP map and sonar combo
838453,Dan668,2014-02-26 02:42:00,1120,Depends on your budget. I run Lowrance HDS finders. Wouldn't part with them ever.
838454,mike rousseau,2014-02-26 02:46:00,4661,One that works and lasts...  : )

838467,Steve,2014-02-26 03:59:00,2075,one where the transducer doesn't fail after a couple years.  i'm not sure they exist.

838475,scugpg,2014-02-26 11:19:00,1373,I would pick the hds 8 gen 2 or the hds 9 touch.  big benefit on the 8 to have the quick access buttons on the bottom.  the 9 has built in structurescan and has the touch screen. rebates on both right now. best value would be the 8 gen 2 out of the two models.
838477,porkpie,2014-02-26 11:45:00,2521,"Anything with an 8 inch touch screen is my dream finder, but realistically what I have is quite satisfactory.  I plan to add either a Minn Kota ipilot or motorguide pinpoint this year, so who knows where that may lead me!"
838483,muddler,2014-02-26 12:08:00,623,As i get older I don't get too picky. This one will do.  
838486,BITEME,2014-02-26 12:53:00,1968,One that shows bottom
838487,Tim Mills,2014-02-26 13:06:00,476,Hope those are snagg proof the silicone leak may sink the boat.
838490,craigdritchie,2014-02-26 13:37:00,1586,Is this better?  Man it's been a long winter.  
838493,BillM,2014-02-26 13:48:00,17367,I need to start fishing in Florida more.
838506,muddler,2014-02-26 14:29:00,623,And for the ladies.  
838525,Lape0019,2014-02-26 17:06:00,647,My request for the next boat will be for at minimum Humminbird 9 series SI units but they just came out with the Onyx series which looks pretty cool. I think they are their answer to Lowrances touch technology. I am not sure I would spend the extra money on it though.
838534,JoshS,2014-02-26 17:35:00,729,"I just upgraded from older units to an 898... Haven't even used her yet. There is some cool stuff out there now, like the ability to create your own charts from sonar readings which I'm excited about (autochart for HB, Sonarcharts for navionics etc). I've used the hds touch series on my buddies boat quit a bit and they are sweet. But my dream fishfinder would be one of the ladies above for sure. There were some good deals out there on 898 and 998's HB's because the 899/999 just came out, probably still are."
838578,wkrp,2014-02-26 21:14:00,656,Lowrance Elite 7 HDI with Navionics Gold. Hopeing to buy one for upcoming season
838606,camillj,2014-02-26 23:20:00,1988,OK .. now Im feeling inadequate with my HB 5 series ... but hey ... I catch lotsa fish ... just have trouble finding the sunken treasure
838616,SirCranksalot,2014-02-27 00:16:00,3291,"As i get older I don't get too picky. This one will do.   You'd probably lose interest in finding fish, catching fish or eating fish if she was on board!!"
838649,Moosebunk,2014-02-27 01:51:00,3970,"Pull out the rod, tweak the artificials, turn 'er on, transducer in the hole, and put the ping speed and sensitivity right up to the max.  They'll be swimming by in no time."
838662,BITEME,2014-02-27 02:12:00,1968,Ha!
838667,fishnguy,2014-02-27 02:28:00,96,"HAHA....love the pics.  Some very good thoughts here. Thank you.  Re-reading my initial post, there was a big typo there that probably gave away my profession.  Only an economist would write ""I'm looking for one with a GDP map"" instead of ""GPS map"".  At any rate, thanks for the feedback."
838698,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-27 06:08:00,8243,"As far as the pics, talk about artificial lures!!!! I'm a natural bait kinda guy myself. One year I asked the woman I was with what she wanted for Christmas, anything she wanted, anything. She said new breasts, I asked how much? 4 grand she said. I said no problem sweetheart, only one thing, I can only afford one this year and one next year. Honest to God swear on my parents lives true story."
