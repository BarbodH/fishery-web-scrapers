837530,danc,2014-02-21 04:00:00,4677,Sweet!!
837532,BillM,2014-02-21 04:05:00,17367,What a tank!  Got any measurements?
837538,bigugli,2014-02-21 04:21:00,6138,That is a beautiful thing.
837539,Joey,2014-02-21 04:26:00,9122,"Wow, that's huge!  Congrats."
837542,jbailey,2014-02-21 04:51:00,866,wow what a tank
837543,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-21 04:55:00,8243,"A monstrous specimen, I've caught large crappie but now I have a different perspective of large. It's nice to see your arms tucked in for the pic of the 2 beauties.  Did you get a weight and measurement,? it really doesn't matter large is big but it would be nice to know.  That smile must be cramping up by now, it will take a while for it to go away.  Way to go kiddo. Smile and be proud, you deserve it."
837551,Terry,2014-02-21 09:57:00,14456,nice
837563,NAW,2014-02-21 12:51:00,4022,What a beast!!
837588,ch312,2014-02-21 15:11:00,1590,"What a tank!  Got any measurements?  Likely just an 11"" fish with an 8 incher for comparison. He just has his arms stretched out as far as possible                                     Nice fish!"
837644,walleye_man,2014-02-21 20:46:00,135,thanks everyone for the positive feedback! still in awe of this fish. the thing was 15 inches long and FAT most likely full of eggs! i fish this lake lots so she went back in hopes i can catch her again when shes pushing 16 LOL have never seen one this big around here so it gives me hope that there are even bigger! cheers
837648,landry,2014-02-21 21:02:00,1005,"I have never caught one that big and I love crappies. Nice fish!!!!!! However, my 11 year daughter caught a 16""er soon after ice out. It looked like a largemouth at first."
837653,misfish,2014-02-21 21:41:00,29133,"Last time I seen one that HUGE, was the one my son caught on a local lake.  Nice SLAB. Nice on the release as well."
837660,BillM,2014-02-21 21:56:00,17367,Good job on releasing that brute!
837683,TerryC,2014-02-22 00:09:00,196,Whoa...Nicely done!
837686,grizzlybri,2014-02-22 00:15:00,565,"well i know i cant post the word that i said when i saw the picture, but wow what a tank."
837688,akaShag,2014-02-22 00:24:00,2073,Any details for us?  Using a flasher?  Over weeds?  Bait?  etc.  Or if it's all information you want to keep to yourself I'll mind my own business.  I have caught many hundreds of crappies and never saw one that big I don't think.  Beauty!  Doug

Doug i like to fish these guys over drops or main lake basins. i use a vexilar fl 12 and suspend 5 feet up. you will see em roll in! the hot jig this season has been a tungsten diamond jig in glow white with maggots... enjoy

Very nice fish."
837778,akaShag,2014-02-22 18:27:00,2073,"THANKS!  Do you keep the maggots lively by storing them in your mouth, like the old timers?  Doug"
