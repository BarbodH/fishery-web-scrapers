838097,i2cool2fool,2014-02-24 04:27:00,349,A lot of happy 88 fans tonight. I am happy for Dale Jr. It's been a while since he won a plate race.
838098,danc,2014-02-24 04:37:00,4677,Congrats to my buddy Misfish and all the other Jr fans. What a great race we were treated to after the rain delay.
838099,danc,2014-02-24 04:54:00,4677,Brian. Don't tell me that you slept through this?
838115,misfish,2014-02-24 12:37:00,29133,Yes I did.  I watched the best part this morning. LOL  http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/2/23/dale-earnhardt-jr-wins-daytona-500-results-standings-wreck.html
838170,nancur373,2014-02-24 18:20:00,1211,"Aww Brian, too bad. Was the best tail end of the 500 in a long time"
838175,tb4me,2014-02-24 18:51:00,3295,Congrats to JR. Im a 41 fan have been a fan of Kurt since the Jack Roush Super chips f-150 days.. Harvick and Kurt were the only 2 Haas drivers to finish..Jr had that barebond stuck to his grill seemed it was enough to keep him out front of the field. He had a strong lead car all day. If I remember correctly the last time he won the 500 was 10 years ago 2004. Sure was odd seeing the #3 chev out there he was in just about every wreck out there last-night..Good Race.. I wish they would always run that race in the dark..
