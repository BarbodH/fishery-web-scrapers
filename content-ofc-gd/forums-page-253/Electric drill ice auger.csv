838108,Musky or Specks,2014-02-24 10:50:00,2710,We use a Dewalt Cordless with a six inch auger. Will drill holes all day. Gone are the days of lugging around a huge gas powered head.
838140,Terry,2014-02-24 16:07:00,14456,I could not find any for sale around here when I was looking. I plan on buying one in the off season.
838147,BFSC Kevin,2014-02-24 16:28:00,1351,"They sold out pretty fast,  those conversion adapter plates.. Lebaron did still have the whole entire conversion kit the last time I went in..  In two ft of ice and using a 8 inch auger.. I think I get about 20 holes on the 4amp-hour battery.  Previously I did test 32.5 holes in over a foot ice.  I didn't measure exactly how thick it was though.."
