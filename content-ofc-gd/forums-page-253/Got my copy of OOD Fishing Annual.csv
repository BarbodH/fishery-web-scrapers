837753,akaShag,2014-02-22 16:06:00,2073,"Subscription is free with membership in the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH).  OFAH (of which I have been a life member since they first offered lifetime membership) is our voice with the government on a host of important issues.  I know that some folks have issues with the federation for a number of reasons, but surely it is the old adage, ""united we stand, divided we fall.""  And amongst the many benefits of membership is a ""FREE"" subscription to Ontario Out of Doors...........  JMOYMV  Doug"
