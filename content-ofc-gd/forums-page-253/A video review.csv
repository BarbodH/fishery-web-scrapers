Don't be too harsh with me as it was me playing with the first time with a slide so I was just having fun. Worse comes to worse just turn your speakers off. haha Some fishing, hunting and camping shots from the last year. No dead mammals in the in the video don't worry.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42qsDIFHfxU"
