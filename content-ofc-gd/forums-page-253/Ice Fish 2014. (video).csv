838103,TDunn,2014-02-24 07:02:00,680,Great video man! Solid laker season on the ice!  TDunn
838132,Moosebunk,2014-02-24 15:28:00,3970,"Thanks again all.  Making videos is an even longer and more involved process than writing reports, but this was fun for something different and the end result IMhumbleO is pretty cool to me.   Very creative video  - loved the hooksets and psychadelic laker thrashes set to the music!  Totally Pete!!!  Drilling the hole and my girls being funny and swinging their arms in the sleigh were favorites for me too."
838146,Headhunter,2014-02-24 16:28:00,5703,"Thanks Drew, I really enjoyed that! Nothing like stickin 'em in the brain on the hook set! Thanks for taking the time and showing us! HH"
838243,MJL,2014-02-25 01:16:00,2427,Nicely done Drew  You've inspired me and given me some ideas on a few videos and pictures I'd like to take in the future
838254,akaShag,2014-02-25 01:47:00,2073,"As I stated elsewhere, that is an awesome video.  I did recognize small parts of it.  Yeah, I did find the music not to have been something I might have picked myself.  And yep, in '95 I wasn't 30, I was forty............so officially an old fart now I reckon.  Maybe next sound track could feature Uriah Heep.............  Doug"

837141,Moosebunk,2014-02-19 07:48:00,3970,"Apologies for your loose chiclets Wayne... but not for those AWESOME deafening tunes by White Zombie.  Some of you doods aren't old, you must actually be ancient.  Those two songs are nearly 20 years old now.  What were yas in 95 eh?  like 30??? lol.  Those tunes gotta make ya think hooksets and sled rides... everytime!  Thanks peeps!"
837147,solopaddler,2014-02-19 10:46:00,8605, Those tunes gotta make ya think hooksets and sled rides... everytime!    I'm thinking about kicking puppies while wearing a dirty sweat stained wife beater tee shirt when I hear that music.
837156,Rod Caster,2014-02-19 12:45:00,5784,"Kicking puppies is a Rob Zombie approved activity.   Nice Vid, lovin' the massive hooksets and the double holes. I used to drill double holes while Laker fishing 'just incase' that big one was caught."

837167,Joey,2014-02-19 14:38:00,9122,Wicked cool video Drew.  Love the tunes.  Now I better get back to work
837182,adempsey,2014-02-19 15:51:00,1498,Nice video!  Great season you're having so far.  My video would show me washing lures for hours on end with Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik (Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major) playing in the background.
837185,BillM,2014-02-19 16:09:00,17367,You can never have enough White Zombie.
