I'm in hamilton and there was about 18"" of ice last Saturday, anyone fished today how much of the ice did we loose?"

Later this week will be even more ice - slushy for sure today good luck getting huts of next weekend in Kawarthas as they are now in ice, never used a flame thrower before!"
837914,porkpie,2014-02-23 12:50:00,2521,"Lots of ice, but some deep slush beds for the bikes and sleds.  Walking conditions are getting pretty good, and will be better still in a day or 2.  A lot of the snow has been knocked down."
