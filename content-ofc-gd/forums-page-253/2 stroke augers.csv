838561,davey buoy,2014-02-26 19:51:00,5505,"Just picked up one recently,It's a Jiffy,only 28lbs.How many holes a day would that machine run on one tank of gas?.Still want to keep my arm strong with me in case of a break down.With this now I am able to drill more holes and move.It's a 8"" model.Is extra gas a necessity?I realistically can't see more than 20 holes a day.The ice is now 2' plus now.That's my worry.Trying to keep the sleigh as light as possible,it's all ready loaded up with my and other people's gear.Thanks."
838562,Fisherman,2014-02-26 19:54:00,7201,I would rough guess at least 40-50. I have never been able to drain a tank in one day.
838565,NAW,2014-02-26 20:03:00,4022,I would think Fisherman is close..  Mine is a Strikemaster.  I punched 12 holes through 3' of ice and it only burned about 1/4 tank.
838566,12footspringbok,2014-02-26 20:10:00,459,"Full tank on a jiffy will last me half the season..... I also do a lot of ice fishing weekends only though, but generally make swiss cheese of the lake I'm on that day."
838582,davey buoy,2014-02-26 21:25:00,5505,"Thanks guys,looks like I will be alright."
838585,bare foot wader,2014-02-26 21:43:00,1354,"full tank in the eskimo 51 will last about a month or so with heavy fishing on wknds, never counted but it's a lot of holes"
838725,Headhunter,2014-02-27 14:02:00,5703,"Perch fishing, I usually drill 10-20 holes per spot. It seems that I can do that all day and still have fuel left in the tank. Drill away! HH"
838826,Dara,2014-02-27 20:05:00,3052,"You will be wore out yourself if you drill enough holes in one day to empty that tank.  I have never filled mine...I always bring a bit of gas as fire starter so i don't have to worry but still,"
838846,davey buoy,2014-02-27 21:38:00,5505,"Great news guys,won't be able to get out till next Sat to try it.Two commitments this weekend.Should be a few weeks coming up that we'll be able to give it a good workout."
838851,akaShag,2014-02-27 22:10:00,2073,"I had a 3 hp Jiffy with a ten inch auger blade, and a tank of gas would last for more holes than I would ever drill in a weekend, let alone a day.  (Like everybody already said but I am post whoring now that I am a net mender instead of a fingerling or whatever it is/was...............)  Doug  PS)  It seems to me (and I had an older Jiffy) that the mix was a lot richer than usual, like maybe 24:1????  Not 40:1 like my chain saws etc....."

838870,wallyboss,2014-02-27 23:32:00,1095,"I was told by a mechanic that the best thing I could do to my new Jiffy 3 hp(yeah that one akashag) is to take the auger off put the head part on top of a plastic bucket, start it and put it a 3/4 throttle for 15 -20 minutes to do a good break-in. So i had about half a tank of gas in it and I let it go for 20 minutes. You can dig a lot of holes in 20 minutes of digging time and I only used a bit more than 1/4 tank. Now it works really good. But I still can't lie it on it's side without stalling it.  If it's a new one the gas oil mixture is 40:1.  If you can get oyur hands on Jiffy brand smokeless oil (it has gas stabilizer in it already) it comes in a small plastic bottle that is made to be mixed with 1 gallon of gas. http://www.jiffyonice.com/EComStore/product/2-cycle-oil,2739,25.htm"

838874,wallyboss,2014-02-27 23:45:00,1095,"No I never do that it has iced it up.  I just said that it stalls as soon as I tilt it. So I cannot walk from hole to hole holding it with one hand. I had a 2hp before that I started it 20 seconds later turn off the choke set it down on it's side and setup my Clam while the auger warmed up good. Now I have have to hold it upright to warm up   (aka shag I should've never done that trade, I've regretted it since. I really miss my 2hp)"
838886,akaShag,2014-02-28 00:44:00,2073,"back to wallyboss............  Hi Dan!And I gave that auger away to somebody or other when I bought a BRAND NEW Jiffy 2 hp 8"" auger when Canadian Tire was selling them for less than half price a few springs ago.  The NEW JIffy had a PLASTIC keeper for the bolt that attaches the head to the drill.  DUHHHHHHHHHH!!!  I gave THAT ONE to a guy as down payment for a lease on a hunt camp.  And now I own a Nils Master, best power auger EVER!!!  Doug"
