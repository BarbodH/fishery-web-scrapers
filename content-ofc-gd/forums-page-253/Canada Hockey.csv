A team does not form over night, it takes time for the team to come together and trust one another.  Team Cananda showed us just well a team grows.  They got stronger and stronger as the tournament progressed.  This team was unbeatable.  Lativa had an incredibly hot goaltender who played his heart out and made his NHL franchise proud ( hes currently in the AHL)  The US was a great team as well, they just got out played.  The had the most goals scored, think it was 20 goals on 100 shots going into the semi, Canada had 13 on 150 shots i think, half coming from the canons on the back end.  In the end, it doesn't matter who leads the scoring, all the matters is that everyone does their job, if the forwards aren't scoring but are clogging up the middle enabling the D'men to get off the big one timers, then they are doing their jobs.  This Team Canada was the best team ever assembled and it showed big time.  Mr Babcock did a great job, great coach, calm, cool, collected, his relaxed nature reflected across the entire team and they were able to stay loose and play great hockey.  GOLD CANADA GOLD!"

I do feel bad for him but rules is rules.. Also as far as doubting our team Canada, that's what this forum is for. Discussion, we all have opinions.. Some are right and some are wrong..Thats what makes this place so awesome..Lets face it, if we ALL were as hockey smart as we think we All are, we would be making big bucks in the sport..So unless your team Canada Brass or an AHL NHL coach its all just armchair sporting.."

BUT, only in NA did anyone consider the states to be a contender.  they have only received two medals in hockey since 1980.  they really are overrated here in NA.  internationally, no one gave the USA any thoughts of a medal.  Canada, Sweden, Russia, Finland (these are the biggest medal winners in the last three decades).  we live in NA, as such we buy into the NHL propaganda about how great NA teams are. Not sure if you follow the international HF boards but reading how the world sees international hockey, the states, and their two medals in 30 years, aren't nearly the favourite they are here in NA.  Its going to be a fun morning tomorrow"

I realize they aren't the most popular country out there, but they've got a lot of talent.  I hope our boys come out screaming tomorrow and just put it to Sweden for the entire 60mins."
837781,Steve,2014-02-22 18:39:00,2075,that we can agree on! i'm throwing a good house party tonight....we plan on going all night to be right ready for the game tomorrow morning  It's a good time to be a Canadian with a Finnish background.  Tomorrow is going to be a great time for Canadian Hockey!

837791,kickingfrog,2014-02-22 19:33:00,8333,I don't remember any serious talk about the US as medal favourite until they won a game in a SO against an awful Russian team. Don't forget that but for a disallowed goal the Russians win that game and medal talk never starts for the US.  Lundqvist plays back in the net. Deflections don't get by him as much but the corners are bigger.

837834,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-23 00:20:00,8243,"Steve, a little off topic. In 98' my crew and I went to Oulu Finland to visit Rautoruuki Steel in December. At 07:00 (at -30C) in the AM as we were traveling to the plant I asked one of the Fins what the great lights in the distance was. That's all the school kids skating. They all, every one of them from 1st grade to 12, skate from 06:30 until 08:00. School from 9 until 12, skate from 12:30 to 1:30. Back to school until 4PM. Then hockey practice starts. I turned to one of the guys that coaches AA here and said "" Robbie we're in trouble "". It's all paying of for the Fins, and the Latvians and, and, and. It's funny how the harder you work the luckier you get."

Camera angle I'm talking about is the camera is facing the players as they skate towards it, so you're looking at them skating towards the camera. Canadian players right foot on a big long stride extends out behind her and contacts the right foot of the American player just behind. that contact is what causes them both to fall. it was actually the Canadian player that caused them both to fall. I'm not going to complain about the outcome, because I was cheering for Canada. But I don't think anybody can say that the American caused a penalty there. Just being fair.  If you were that ref and saw that play, what would you call?  Remember you don't have the luxury to watch every single angle in slow mo     At a minimum it's an interference call in my books."

They won the draw in their own end, the Defense man immediately came off the ice .. The benches are so long that the forward was able to come out the other end of the bench and behind Our Dman..Ted Nolan is one hell of a creative dude..He spotted that and it payed off..Hats off to them.

837217,lookinforwalleye,2014-02-19 19:10:00,4399,"hate to say it but i think canada will be riding home with the russians later today,,,,,,,hope I am wrong but my gut feeling is telling me different "
837218,lookinforwalleye,2014-02-19 19:12:00,4399,"anti-climactic.  i guess we'll sneak this one out...but.....as I said two pages ago --- we need to really step it up.  i know, i know, he's only one player, but......is crosby even playing? Take your pick....anybody seen toews ???"
837219,bow slayer,2014-02-19 19:14:00,1074, like i said hope i am wrong....and it is still not over
837220,BucktownAngler,2014-02-19 19:16:00,582,Finally!!!!!  looked like the fix was in for a min
837221,Steve,2014-02-19 19:23:00,2075,"well, at least sid won a faceoff.....that was important.  Go Finns and Go Canada!"
837222,Steve,2014-02-19 19:23:00,2075,fix? we sucked. bad. hard. fully. and completely.
837223,muddler,2014-02-19 19:31:00,623,"What game were you watching? 55-15 shots. Out played them completely. One super hot goaltender for Latvia kept it close , that's it. A missed penalty shot. Wow! Like said 1-0 or 20-0  A WIN IS A WIN. We are the ONLY undefeated team there.  And we sucked.  Well done Canada Muddler"
837224,BucktownAngler,2014-02-19 19:34:00,582, fix? we sucked. bad. hard. fully. and completely.  how do you figure?  Latvia was domintated in every aspect of the game...and these are just the basic stats  
837225,glen,2014-02-19 19:38:00,2641,Canada sucked because they could have lost.
837226,Acountdeleted,2014-02-19 19:40:00,2562,I'm worried about the USA on Friday.
837229,Steve,2014-02-19 19:45:00,2075,"i'm sorry, i watched the game.  i don't follow stats, cause clearly, as per the above, they don't dictate much about the actual hockey game.  if a AAA team beats a house league team by one goal, and out shoots them 10 to 1, does that mean the AAA team didn't stink? nope, they stunk! just like we did!"
837230,grimsbylander,2014-02-19 19:45:00,3016,"I'm glad I can't quote...  By the posts on here it looks like some of the fans are the sucks. Win 8-0 or you're a bunch of over-paid, lazy bums. Try to understand more of the game than just how many times the flashing red light goes on behind the net."
837232,Steve,2014-02-19 19:48:00,2075,"Thanks, I'll try."
837233,muddler,2014-02-19 19:50:00,623,"Thanks, I'll try.  Now you got!"
837234,BucktownAngler,2014-02-19 19:52:00,582,"i'm sorry, i watched the game.  i don't follow stats, cause clearly, as per the above, they don't dictate much about the actual hockey game.  if a AAA team beats a house league team by one goal, and out shoots them 10 to 1, does that mean the AAA team didn't stink? nope, they stunk!  just like we did!   i also watched, and Canada dominated  Latvia's goalie stood on his head.  you should just wait for the final score to make your assumptions about the game"
837235,davey buoy,2014-02-19 19:53:00,5505,"A win is a win,I'll take it.They will play better against the USA team.The unknown was what we were up against.We know the USA players and play the same game."
837236,Steve,2014-02-19 19:55:00,2075,"sorry, I don't wear rose coloured glasses when i watch the games.  assumptions? i watched the game and gave my comments. no assumptions were made."
837237,muddler,2014-02-19 20:01:00,623,Canada 2   Latvia 1    'nuf said!
836872,kickingfrog,2014-02-17 18:29:00,8333,
836946,Acountdeleted,2014-02-18 02:07:00,2562,Crosby needs to learn how to score more then just one goal on the Olympic stage.
836956,kickingfrog,2014-02-18 03:04:00,8333,Ya a point a game over 10 whole games while playing reduced minutes is a real indicator of an over hyped hack.
836958,glen,2014-02-18 03:08:00,2641,Team canada doesn't look very good.  I have watched all of there games. The collapse and try not to lose teams need a good lesson in hockey.  Attack with speed or pass with speed. That will pound all teams and win the gold.
836977,moxie,2014-02-18 12:20:00,1566,"How many Canadian athletes have owned world championships in their respective sports leading to these games and for one reason or another have been nowhere to be found when it really counted?  Many of us seem to forget how far the ""other"" countries have come when it comes to hockey. As I said before, a hot goaltender, defense first and a lucky bounce........anything can happen. There is, after all, another team out on the rink."
836981,grimsbylander,2014-02-18 12:39:00,3016,A point a game while playing those numbers would be good in regular NHL games. Doing it against the best hand picked players in the world is terrific.
836984,muddler,2014-02-18 13:22:00,623,"It doesn't matter if you win 20-19, 10-0 or 1-0.  I haven't seen the other teams do anything great on the scoreboard against us. We are getting a lot of excellent chances to score. You can't ask for more than that. And you can't will the puck into the net. One super hot goal tender in one game could change things. That happens in this type of tournament.  Remember that the opposing team are very aware of Cosby and what he is capable of doing. When there best defensive players are used to work against Cosby the rest of Canada's lines up can face lesser defensive players.  I am impressed with Canada's toughness and talent. This is a superior team compared to the rest of the field.  Bring it on!"
837002,Acountdeleted,2014-02-18 16:33:00,2562,Crosby gets keyed on by these guys all the time in the NHL. I can't get excited about a point a game where 2/3rds of the round robin games are against the Edmonton Oilers and Buffalo Sabers of the world.  I really haven't noticed Crosby on the ice yet this year to be honest.
837026,kickingfrog,2014-02-18 19:40:00,8333,That says a lot doesn't it.   Well Ted Nolan gets to coach against Canada tomorrow. The Swiss were down 2-0 and they still played 5 back.
837048,tb4me,2014-02-18 22:42:00,3295,That says a lot doesn't it.   Well Ted Nolan gets to coach against Canada tomorrow. The Swiss were down 2-0 and they still played 5 back. Ya I got to see the last period..Was surprised to notice the exact same thing. Why wouldn't they go for it
837052,tb4me,2014-02-18 22:47:00,3295,As far as Crosby is concerned he is average at best and does need to be better..Lets home he steps up his game big time..Latvia tomorrow Think I feel a nasty cold or something coming on for the rest of the week...lol its a good thing im self employed or I may of ended up unemployed...Who else is gonna play hookie for the games?  Go Canada Go!
837056,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-18 23:14:00,10439,"No need to play hookie here. I'm streaming the Olympics live over our college's Student Information System, a network of LCD flat screens all over the college. Plus I'm running it on a laptop in my office."
837135,Acountdeleted,2014-02-19 06:08:00,2562,I have data entry tomorrow. Perfect time to slip an ear bud in to stream the game over the radio.
837180,BucktownAngler,2014-02-19 15:47:00,582,you can stream video too. thats what ill be doing
837191,tb4me,2014-02-19 17:05:00,3295,"NOVECHKIN ha ha ha ya bum, heading back to Washington.. The only way this day could be better is for Canada to win.."
837193,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-19 17:27:00,10439,GOAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!
837194,tb4me,2014-02-19 17:31:00,3295,Oh boy....Latvia gets right back in it..Carey Price just looked like I was playing net....
837195,DRIFTER_016,2014-02-19 17:38:00,10439,Canada looks like they're sitting back instead of taking it to the Slovaks. They need to step up the intensity or they could end up like the Russians.
837201,tb4me,2014-02-19 18:12:00,3295,Were out shooting them 33-8 but they are out hitting us big time..Why aren't we hitting back? Oh thats right Mike Babcock at the helm..Dont care for his coaching style.. We need to get physical quick.
837203,tb4me,2014-02-19 18:13:00,3295,This is NOT the team Canada I have been watching all my life.. Come on boys...
837204,glen,2014-02-19 18:24:00,2641,Canada is taking the puck in so slow the other team is always back and ready.  Spread them out before we lose. Crosby wake up there is a hockey game going on and you suck.   New game plan coach.  Cherry pick and skate.   Lazy bunch of losers.  Hardly worth watching.
837205,BucktownAngler,2014-02-19 18:31:00,582,if duchene & subban arent in the the lineup against the US we will lose.thats if we even win this game.  we need the speed on the ice to open up space and make plays.
837207,fishindevil,2014-02-19 18:42:00,6254,looks like canada is trying to play the trap ???
837208,lookinforwalleye,2014-02-19 18:44:00,4399,Oh boy....Latvia gets right back in it..Carey Price just looked like I was playing net.... Really...I thought the two 8 million dollar defensemen that let a guy named whatshisface get behind them looked like you!!!
837209,BucktownAngler,2014-02-19 18:45:00,582,Really...I thought the two 8 million dollar defensemen that let a guy named whatshisface get behind them looked like you!!!  ya that defs was not on Carey
835941,BucktownAngler,2014-02-12 15:00:00,582,"Great game by the womens team beating the US 3-2 i thought we were gonna get whooped, the US has been on fire.  For the mens team, Price in net game 1, Luongo in net Game 2. Both should be easy Canada wins "
835943,BillM,2014-02-12 15:03:00,17367,"Great womens game today, especially in the 3rd."
836034,Broker,2014-02-12 21:05:00,482,"On the mens side, do not agree where they have Duchene, top 6 guy."
836237,BucktownAngler,2014-02-13 19:56:00,582,"On the mens side, do not agree where they have Duchene, top 6 guy. he was a healthy scratch today, along with Subban.  i really dont get sitting Subban. seems like all puck moving defensemen are thriving on the big ice"
836239,davey buoy,2014-02-13 20:17:00,5505,"he was a healthy scratch today, along with Subban.  i really dont get sitting Subban. seems like all puck moving defensemen are thriving on the big ice I figured PK would of at least had a shift.Keep his temper down and he is one of the best.I noticed Stlouis had some ice time.Good for him!!!"
836241,kickingfrog,2014-02-13 20:23:00,8333,"It's not as if this is one of 30 nhl teams. There is not really a ""weak"" player that you could point at and say he's not good enough. These are all top-line guys that play 20plus minutes. Six to seven of these forwards are going to play less the 12 or so minutes a game. They need to understand their roles.  And Subban can move the puck on the big ice (so can just about every other all-star on this team). He also then has to make-up that big ice when he's out of position.  They play 2 teams that offer minimal high level challenge which really makes it hard to truly evaluate where they sit."
836244,BucktownAngler,2014-02-13 20:37:00,582,"  And Subban can move the puck on the big ice (so can just about every other all-star on this team). He also then has to make-up that big ice when he's out of position.  hes going to play tomorrow, i expect him to ""earn"" much more playing time going forward"
836290,moxie,2014-02-14 02:01:00,1566,Listened to a bit of the game at work and once they were done the analysis began. They're still analysing the damn thing at 9pm. One game. They won. Too many dough headed hockey pucks getting paid to chase their tails. Too funny.
836372,Mike Pike,2014-02-14 18:06:00,1332,"I agrea Moxie.  And I'm tired of everyone in the media yesterday telling me; 'Relax, people, it's just one game!'  I AM relaxed.  I'm not the one anazlizing a game with Norway for 24 hours after the fact!  No, YOU relax!"
836373,kickingfrog,2014-02-14 18:25:00,8333,"So Mr. Snider, about Team Canada's ability to select talent..."
836650,glen,2014-02-16 17:29:00,2641,Doughty Just scored.   He sure is playing good.
836651,davey buoy,2014-02-16 17:33:00,5505,What a fast paced game!!!Go Canada!!!!!
836652,Steve,2014-02-16 18:00:00,2075,"we need to stay sharp.  like in the juniors, the Finns are strong again.  Leo is rockin' it again. Doughty was reminded what Komarov's shoulder felt like."
836654,Steve,2014-02-16 18:32:00,2075,"well now, this is going to be a good third period."
836655,misfish,2014-02-16 18:33:00,29133,"Were dominating the ice,but not the score board."
836660,kickingfrog,2014-02-16 19:01:00,8333,"Finland is doesn't have the horses, or the talent. They are playing not to lose, they are good at it, and used to it."
836661,davey buoy,2014-02-16 19:17:00,5505,"Way to go guys!!!!!!!!Gotta admit,Finland played pretty well."
836662,muddler,2014-02-16 19:18:00,623,Great game for Canada. Played like champions. Just Awesome.
836663,misfish,2014-02-16 19:22:00,29133,Lucky us.
836664,Steve,2014-02-16 19:24:00,2075,"well, glad we won the game.....but.....wow - we are going to really have to wake up and step it up .... four notches ....  i hope crosby turns his game up a couple notches as well."
836666,misfish,2014-02-16 19:35:00,29133,  We all get older and slower.LOL  Sids not the one man team anymore.
836668,kickingfrog,2014-02-16 19:55:00,8333,"You play low skill teams that collapse to the net and the forwards get clogged up and the D-men are open. It won't be any different against the Swiss (or Latvia) but it will be against the Russians and Sweedes. The US doesn't have the skill either but they hate (and don't) play the try not to lose game. Canada is the best team, but the best teams don't always win one-and-done tournaments."
836669,tb4me,2014-02-16 19:59:00,3295,USA has a one line team and Russia cant seem to score..Id be more worried about sweeden then US or Rus
836683,muddler,2014-02-16 20:28:00,623,"We have size, speed and  offensive talent.  We are jelling at just the right time. No major injuries and a team hungry for gold.  Go Canada go!"
