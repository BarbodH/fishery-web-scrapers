The other day I counted 16 along a couple hundred foot fence line. Its so funny to be in the middle of the city, and see so many deer at once! This time of year you can't drive by without seeing a few, summer time they are hidden deeper in the refinery.  Does anybody else here know about this? I'm curious about the population and if the MNR monitors them and if they ever remove any.  I wish I had pictures, maybe I'll take some tomorrow."
838290,BITEME,2014-02-25 12:32:00,1968,Are you talking the one in west Oakville Their is one very large monarch in that mix and a whole lot of big males its a very healthy herd they have been resident there for a long long time im sure the ministry knows about them i have never heard about any moving or culling over the years the airport has a very large herd they have to split up every so often the herd at Petro(Suncor) west travels up and down 12 mile creek into Bronte Creek Provincial park and surrounding feilds throughout the year  If it is the east plant the bush on the west side of the road has a very large herd as well Peter
838357,Tim Mills,2014-02-25 18:09:00,476,Its a nice bonus to see them when fishing or walking the dog along the Credit and Bronte Creek. .
838363,Fang,2014-02-25 18:16:00,1330,"We see numerous deer along Rebecca west of Bronte as we head over to House Of Wings!!!   another visible herd is on south side of 403 extension, past IKEA going into Hamilton. Just west of King Road underpass there is a large open field on the south side. Have counted many in that field while out shopping"

You see so many of them together at this time of year because the deer yard up (group together) in the winter, especially when there is more than 10-12"" of snow on the ground. They do this for better protection against predators by strength in numbers and they're also less mobile in the snow so yarding up also creates well used trails which makes winter travel from bedding to feeding area's much easier.  Same goes for turkey, which is why it's normal to see big flocks throughout the winter."
838377,misfish,2014-02-25 19:09:00,29133,"Where there are big flocks of turkey, you will find deer most of the time. They will come out just after the turkey have scratched up a snow covered field. Easy pick,n for the deer then. We have a forest close to here. It,s a yarding area. Lots of deer there."
838379,lew,2014-02-25 19:18:00,12766,As I type this there are 12 deer in my yard.
