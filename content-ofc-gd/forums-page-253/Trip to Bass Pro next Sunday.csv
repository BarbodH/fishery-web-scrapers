837988,bass_man,2014-02-23 18:11:00,43,I'm planning a run from Brantford to Bass Pro next Sunday and was wondering if anyone from the area wanted to come along.  I can take 2 or 3 guys and we can make a day of it.  I will be taking the designated smoking van so be aware. You don't have to smoke but you have to be able to tolerate it.  Just let me know if you are interested and we can make arrangements to meet.  Jim
