838261,Skud,2014-02-25 02:55:00,739,I read the article from the MNR about supporting the deer herds. Very different from what they usually recommend. I bait for deer every year during the hunting season and then stop by mid December. This year my Dad and I decided to keep feeding them since winter hit so hard and early. The deer have been taking advantage of the free meals every day and there is a highway of tracks to and from the food pile. Even with all the snow the entire area is packed down solid with activity. I took down the trail cam on Jan first because it stops working after -15. Here are a few pictures taken at the end of December.              
838263,Rod Caster,2014-02-25 02:59:00,5784,Nice shots! I do find it odd however that the MNR is bothering with deer when there are hundreds of other species that are actually at risk.

838324,tb4me,2014-02-25 15:35:00,3295,We too feed the deer but only before the hunt. The problem with feeding them after is they will come to expect it and almost depend on it..
838372,Skud,2014-02-25 18:54:00,739,I will stop feeding them by the end of March and start a food plot in August. Come October everyone in the family should be able to harvest a doe. I have plenty of pics of the coyotes too but have yet to find any victims besides rabbits.
