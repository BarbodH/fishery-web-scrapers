838034,Steve,2014-02-23 22:44:00,2075,"that's an ok reel...i'm sure you'll enjoy it....  careful using it in freezing temps (if you were planning on river fishing, or similar)....  that reel isn't sealed very well...water gets in and freezes....happened to a buddy who uses that exact reel for both river fishing and ice fishing....  he's since went to a different reel...but continues to use that reel in the summer without issues."
838035,BowSlayer101,2014-02-23 22:58:00,296,"no man, i don't use such expensive reels for ice fishing, nothing over 30 bucks, just not brave enough lol. Im not paying over 100 bucks to have it break on me for some laker, i use bait casters and cheaper spinning reels with good drags for ice fishing. I just plan on using it for bass, pike, gar, maybe some trout with hardware, musky, etc. I use centerpin gear for river fishing usually."
838037,Steve,2014-02-23 23:00:00,2075,"in that case, you'll love the reel!  have a fun season with it"
838038,davey buoy,2014-02-23 23:01:00,5505,"Good luck,looks good!!!"
838041,BowSlayer101,2014-02-23 23:06:00,296,"thanks guys, hope it works as well as the guys at sail told me it would, lol!"
838127,BucktownAngler,2014-02-24 15:18:00,582,"thanks guys, hope it works as well as the guys at sail told me it would, lol!  is there a sale going on now? how'd you get it for $30 off?"
838142,Christopheraaron,2014-02-24 16:15:00,3525,There was a 15% sale all weekend
838148,bare foot wader,2014-02-24 16:37:00,1354,"nice reel, be careful with that handle"
838151,Rich,2014-02-24 16:58:00,3927,"I have a stradic fj... great reel as well and a lifetime purchase.  Oh, you already picked. Good choice. Lol"
838159,BucktownAngler,2014-02-24 17:23:00,582,There was a 15% sale all weekend  still doesnt equal $30 off
838162,Christopheraaron,2014-02-24 17:38:00,3525," still doesnt equal $30 off It equals $22 off, maybe he rounded it"
838165,Steve,2014-02-24 17:52:00,2075,"the note above about be careful with the handle.  its funny you mentioned that.  my dad has a pflueger president reel....he has had it for a long time...however, his handle ""stripped"" in the first year of use.  the tackle shop took a handle off another pfleuger and he hasn't had an issue since.  i should mention dad's reel has been rock solid in the 8 years he's owned his pfleuger....and he only owns one spinning reel....as such it gets A TON of use!  I wish my Stradics held up like his pfleuger has...."
838169,bare foot wader,2014-02-24 18:19:00,1354,"I've had bad luck with plfueger, don't wanna rain down on buddy's new reel but I broke the handle on my patriarch after a week or so, easy enough to exchange, but it was a lesson I've learned repeatedly mountain biking, carbon snaps and aluminum bends before it fails, why am I such a slow learner ha (and honestly, if a reel can't survive being dropped from mid torso height, it ain't for me)  then after 3 months of use I was rip jigging bucktails for walleye, drag set tight and did a fierce hookset into a musky and the gears seized up, pflueger was good on warranty, took about 2-3 weeks for a new reel...I promptly sold the new reel from warranty and kicked  myself for ever doubting my stradics  I don't mind the cheaper trion and president models for ice fishing, that's about it (but even then a shimano is still better!!)"
838193,BowSlayer101,2014-02-24 20:39:00,296,"i got it 30 bucks off, i don't know how, I'm guessing the cashier screwed up, not my problem, lol, i know shimano is good but after comparing a shimano to a president, i found pflueger is smoother, has more bearings, over all a nicer reel, the more experienced guy said there are shimano and pflueger guys out there but both reels are top notch, he said the pflueger would be a better choice, because it is known for quality and had better reviews, i know a bunch of guys who say that shimano is a problematic reel and the same number of guys saying that about pflueger, i was told though in the long run, i you take care of your reel, and don't drop it and put it in water, etc. then it will last you forever. I got the pflueger because the design was waaaaaay better then the shimano lol, also because it was lighter and just felt better in my hands, with the eva know and carbon handle, so far its been, good, got out with it for some steelies and ended up losing a nice brown, drag help up perfect in freezing conditions, never had a problem, i take care of my reels so i don't see why there should be a problem. I thought about getting the patriarch but the guy there told me the reviews were worse for it, and its not worth the 50 bucks more, he said its not even worth what the supreme costs, it has really thin material that is lightweight but in return breaks very easily, thats what i was told anyways. Also have a few friends that use shimanos for ice fishing and they say the drag screws up and freezes them all the time, (on the stradic models) so that kind of steered me off to."
838194,BowSlayer101,2014-02-24 20:42:00,296,"ok, so i was told that apparently the reels were more then 15% off this past weekend, so thats probably the reason."
838196,BillM,2014-02-24 20:46:00,17367,"As long as you like it, that's all that matters.   As for taking the advice from guys in big box stores, eh that's up for discussion"
838206,BowSlayer101,2014-02-24 21:22:00,296,"this guy is very knowledgeable, I've talked to him even before he worked at sail, i actually had no idea that he worked there but bumped into him, i find bass pro staff don't know the first thing about fishing but almost all the star in the vaughn sail fishing department are very knowledgeable, i don't have the time or money to drive to small stores, they usually charge much more then the big box stores i knew what i wanted, but advice from someone who knows his stuff certaintly didn't help! By the way, I'm not trying to put down the smaller stores, they know their stuff well but id rather save the driving, get the item on sale and if it happens that there are no knowledgeable staff there then just look at the specs and choose myself, however a small bait shop in barrie (bait bucket) caught my attention a month or so ago and a couple weeks ago i picked up a simax med/heavy 7' bass rod for 60 bucks, regular price is $145, so i was very pleased with that, and the guy there was very kind and knowledgeable!"
838209,Steve,2014-02-24 21:28:00,2075,i don't have the time or money to drive to small stores  that's unfortunate.
838211,BowSlayer101,2014-02-24 21:32:00,296," that's unfortunate. lol, to each their own"
838213,Roy,2014-02-24 21:40:00,13728,"Ok, you asked, you received advice, you bought the reel you wanted. That  takes care of this thread I guess. Now go get some fish with it and  show us some pictures!"
837886,BowSlayer101,2014-02-23 04:18:00,296,"hey guys, I'm looking to get a spinning reel for my bass setup, looking for a higher end reel to go with my 7' simax exclusive med/heavy action, i was thinking either the Abu Revo SX ask can get it on sale for 135 at bps in a week, or the Pflueger Supreme XT which i can get around the same price, any suggestions are much appreciated, thanks!"
837888,BillM,2014-02-23 04:35:00,17367,"In that price if you want higher end, you'll need to go used."
837890,musky_hunter,2014-02-23 04:42:00,328,Checkout the daiwa lexa or Procyon spinning reels. Very good for bang for the buck.
837894,leaf4,2014-02-23 07:25:00,2466,"I have the pfleuger supreme xt, and have had 0 issues with it over 2 seasons of moderate use, great reel IMO no bail problems or anything, my friend has a stradic and has had a bunch of issues with it so I am very pleased with my purchase"
837897,Rich,2014-02-23 10:04:00,3927,BPS Extreme is 80 bucks and probably the highest quality spinning reel ive ever owned.
837927,kingofthesteelhead,2014-02-23 13:55:00,140,I have a Daiwa procyon on my main steelhead rod and it has a fantastic drag and is one step up from the SS 1300 series.They retail at around 150 or so.
837934,Gregoire,2014-02-23 14:14:00,1397,"In my opinion when you are gong higher end stuff (over 100$) you need to think about servicing and replacement and service. I would look at shimano reels, and think about the stradic fj for a little more. The reel will last you a long time, and if you even need parts for it you can easily find them. Especially living in the GTA you can make a run to shimano in Peterborough and get your stuff serviced. All the other companies to me seem like faceless organizations in comparison."
837947,porkpie,2014-02-23 14:33:00,2521,"I love shimano gear and own many of their reels, however I have numerous diawas and have never had an issue.  I have a 1300 and a 700 that have way more fish than they should be rightfully entitled to, and both have had only the barest essential maintenance with 0 failures.  Diawa builds good gear!!  Over all the years I have been fishing, I have had only 2 major failures, 1 diawa, 1 shimano.  I know a couple of  guys personally that have had pfluegers fail within a year of purchase, one buddy having had several issues with a couple of reels and read of many more failures online.  I stay away from pfluegers, but your mileage may vary.   Diawa or shimano, you can't go wrong.  And while a little bit dated, I believe the 1300/700 line of diawas are quite possibly the most bullet proof reels around!  If I wanted something from shimano, I'd add a few more dollars to your budget and get a stradic.  I own 3 and they are all very solid!"
837950,BowSlayer101,2014-02-23 15:02:00,296,"im gonna stop by at sail today and have a loo at the stradic and pfleuger, all the reviews i read for all reels have mixed reviews, both the shimano and pflueger have near 5 stars and pflueger is known for quality from the president, I've heard guys say that shimano is amazing and some guys say that they'll never go back after using pflueger, lol. I'll just see which one fees better and has a better drag, I'm debating over a shimano or a pflueger right now."
837953,Christopheraaron,2014-02-23 15:14:00,3525,"Shimano Sahara, best spinning reel I've ever owned."
837954,Freshtrax,2014-02-23 15:17:00,2215,I second that.  I own 2.
837955,kickingfrog,2014-02-23 15:25:00,8333,Lots of sales in the next month or so. Shop around.
837957,BillM,2014-02-23 15:40:00,17367,"Buy an older user Stradic (white model), it will last you forever and will be well under $140."
837962,BowSlayer101,2014-02-23 16:11:00,296,"ya i was thinking of buying used but for that money i don't want anything second hand, i looked at the shamans they look nice but I'm not a fan of their designs, its no biggie but still, ill definitely have a look at some shimanos."
837963,BillM,2014-02-23 16:14:00,17367,I thought you wanted a higher end reel?  That's the only way you're going to get one in that price range.
837964,Fisherpete,2014-02-23 16:15:00,1814,"I have both a Daiwa Procyon and a Shimano Stradic FJ, both are excellent reels In that price range. I also have one of the older white Stradics, it is well over 10 years old and still works perfect!"
837965,bare foot wader,2014-02-23 16:31:00,1354,"shimano sahara or saros are both in your price range, I've never had a plfueger survive more than 2-3  yrs of abuse, I just don't think they stand up very well...or a few bucks more for a stradic, I still have stradics that are 7-10 yrs old and going strong"
837967,Gregoire,2014-02-23 16:32:00,1397,"I thought you wanted a higher end reel?  That's the only way you're going to get one in that price range.   You already made your point. For some people over $100 is higher end, for some people it is $500+."
837971,SlowPoke,2014-02-23 16:45:00,2984,"In my opinion; you're not going to find too much difference in reels from $80-$120, they're all damn good! Some tend to balance a little better than others (less wobble when spinning) but you'll go out of your mind trying to determine the BEST $100 reel. I've always ended up with Shimano because I've never been disappointed and I can recommend the Symetre or Saros without hesitation."
837974,Christopheraaron,2014-02-23 17:02:00,3525,"I second that. I own 2. Same here, that may even become 3!"
837981,solopaddler,2014-02-23 17:41:00,8605,In that price range I'd be looking at a Shimano Saros FA. They redesigned them last year and are an incredible reel for the money.
838000,adempsey,2014-02-23 18:40:00,1498,I really like my Shimano Symetres.  Never liked the feel of the Pflueger's and have had problems with my Daiwa reels.   I have some lower end Abu Garcia's that I use for ice fishing that I think are great too.  I'd still probably stick with something made by Shimano.    Doesn't hurt to keep an eye out for online sales either.  I picked up some closeout Symetres from American Legacy Fishing for $79 each free shipping last year.
838003,BillM,2014-02-23 19:02:00,17367,"  You already made your point. For some people over $100 is higher end, for some people it is $500+.  He gave his budget, I'm just trying to get him the best reel for the $$$."
838019,jeffw,2014-02-23 21:00:00,267,I love my last years model but the older model energy reel is still smoother and in my opinion has a better drag. Cheers jeff
838033,BowSlayer101,2014-02-23 22:38:00,296,"thanks for the input guys, i looked at some shimanos, i didn't really like the sahara, the drag was as good as the pfluegers i looked at but the design wasn't the best and the huge reel handle didn't really get my vote, i looked at some stradics, the cheaper white ones were ok and not far from my budget regular price 190, i could have gotten it for 150, i liked the stradic for 280 but thats was way out of my budget, the guys there recommended the shimanos and the pfluegers, they all told me that some guys like shimanos, others pfluegers, they all perform sty about the same level if they aren't abused. I looked at a daiwa but the guys there said its a problematic reel, so i looked at the pflueger supreme xt and the even more expensive one, didn't see a difference between the two, i though it wasn't worth the extra 50 bucks, i ended up getting the pflueger supreme xt, the experienced older guy at sail said he has had one since it came out and never had any issues, just gotta take care of it. They spooled it with 15 lb power pro for me, came with a reel glove and an extra spool, weights 8.5 ounces, carbon fibre handle and magnesium body, regular price was 150, they gave it to me for 120, overall I'm pleased with it, looks great, drag is amazing, really light, it met my expectations, heres a few pics:[/url"
