837278,Rich,2014-02-19 22:26:00,3927,"Anybody know where to get a relatively ($100 or less) cheap carp pod? I tried online but wow are they hard to find. Tried ""carp kit international"" found one for 40 bucks or so but they wouldn't accept my postal code as valid. Not sure why, BPS ships to it all the time. Anyway, any other online outlets or local southern ON vendors anyone knows of? Would like one before ice out (so y'know, June)"
837284,DOS,2014-02-19 22:45:00,119,"I can get them, $79 for a Wynchwood pocket rod pod.  I am in Orangeville  Dan"
837301,Fang,2014-02-19 23:57:00,1330,"Carp kit is located in Milton Rich. There should be a number on the site. I've placed a couple phone orders with him in the past  The other one I use is New World Carp in Hamilton, they usually carry a different line of products  My pod is the pro logic 3 rod, I've been happy with it being a bit more stable and heavy to suit the longer 13 ft rods  Last time I looked bills bait and fishing world both had a couple pods lying about, can't remember price or brand  Seen a pretty cool rig last fall that used the basic camera tripods from XS Cargo for $15 each but you still need bars and rod rests"
837302,Fang,2014-02-20 00:02:00,1330,"Hit post before I finished my thought  I built my first one out of 3/4 white PVC water pipe With t's, elbows and 45's I made one to do 2 rods for maybe 40 bucks  Used picture on the web to come up with a basic plan. Probably would still work for me today if I hadn't left it on the bank down in Hamilton one day. Hope whoever found it is still using it"
837307,Rich,2014-02-20 00:13:00,3927,"I was thinking about making my own , since carp fishing appears to still be months away anyway, lol.. but thanks everyone for the advice.. DOS, I may just be in touch if my creative side fails me."
837308,Rich,2014-02-20 00:14:00,3927,"You don't happen to have any pics of your homemade job, do ya?"
837310,nancur373,2014-02-20 00:24:00,1211,how many rods are you allowed while carp fishing. Lots of carp in Pigeon lake and I was thinking of trying for a few this spring
837313,crappieperchhunter,2014-02-20 01:10:00,2582,I got one from Photoz real cheap when he got me into carping. If I had not gotten a deal I would have made my own. I figure you could build one for free no problem. A bit of scrap lumber some nails and screws.
837314,shane,2014-02-20 01:17:00,652,"I make mine on the spot. Made with locally grown, biodegradable materials. Two forked sticks. One taller than the other. Placed at precise intervals. I'm working on a non-forked model for those times when I just can't find a forked one."
837327,Rich,2014-02-20 02:33:00,3927,"Hey I been using the sticks for a long time.. just like a bass fisherman wants a bigger bass boat I want fancier sticks, lol"
837344,mike rousseau,2014-02-20 05:30:00,4661,Carp kit international  New world carp  Canadian carp club even has an online shop now...  I prefer carp kit... Great to deal with
837345,mike rousseau,2014-02-20 05:34:00,4661,"I have a rod pod...  But 90% of the time bank sticks are the easiest/fastest way to go... And I don't me branches... Lol  Rod pods are needed if your set up on rock or something.,, or using multiple rods... In Ontario they aren't really needed very often..."
837350,Rich,2014-02-20 11:15:00,3927,The reason I want the pod is because the swim behind my house is all big concrete slabs. I can jam the bank sticks in between the cracks but it is not the same as having a pod. But I guess a homemade job would do just fine for that.
837356,Mike Pike,2014-02-20 13:02:00,1332,"I have that same postal code problem from time to time, Rich.  Dunno why.  But if you e-mail Carpkit, the fellow in Milton will e-mail you back and probably help you with your problem.  A very good fellow to deal with.  Or if he has the pod you're looking for in stock, you can probably arrange a time to pick it up at his place.  Very jealous that you have a swim behind your house.  I have Main Street in Hamilton behind mine!  lol"
837358,limeyangler,2014-02-20 13:28:00,5204,"This is a UK based website, i get some lures there from time to time, good shipping rates. They definitely cater toward the carp anglers. You can also set up the site to show prices in C$ instead of UK pounds.  http://www.harrissportsmail.com"
837664,dwc67,2014-02-21 22:07:00,140,there is one in hamilton just google hamilton carp tackle
837792,Beans,2014-02-22 19:38:00,3339,"Hey Rich...I use the bank stix I purchased from New World Carp in Hamilton (very sturdy and adjustable for height)...On the one in front one I screw on an alarm and on the back one I screwed on a holder...these also can be purchased from New World Carp...To get around fishing on concrete. I built a pod out of a four foot piece of 2""x 6"" spruce and drilled a hole just big enough to hold the bank stix snugly...see blow:  Stephan (owner of New World Carp) also has a forum on www.carpfishingcanada.com ... Check out their classified section...guys are always buying and selling stuff      "
