Next year, the good lord willing I intend to be back at my normal post (hopefully with a couple of my trusty sidekicks) and helping with the food side of things! (if my help is needed that is, things looked pretty well organized when I was there).  I was just wondering if the final count is in for attendance, and totals and I know Elisa had some pictures as well.  Kudos to all that donated, participated, and helped out!  "
