837900,Rod Caster,2014-02-23 10:51:00,5784,"Long held plans are hard to break. Doesn't matter if it means waking up at 4am facing 90km/hr gusts and a thick blanket of snow. Doesn't matter.  Nick (NAW) and Jason (LivinFishin) and I met up in Callander at 545am as we picked a fight with Lake Nipissing on the windiest day of the year. You can guess now who won that fight.  We never made it out to my shack, its too far in blizzard conditions, the old tracks are gone and I won't risk crossing a pressure crack after conditions change like that and visibility is low.  We bumbled around a small area of the lake, getting stuck, guessing and generally just showing up to the fight. We fished three locations and got into a few small fish, but nothing worth discussing.  At 4pm we were done. DONE. I was asleep at 7pm last night. The photos will explain.  Still I had a great time, lots of laughs and some catching up!  Early morning snow     Nick in his little cubby       Exactly how I felt after hours of wind-blasting "

837909,limeyangler,2014-02-23 12:06:00,5204,LOLOL….love the last pic Chad! Sums up what the other pictures are saying ….PERFECTLY!  awesome report…hardcore!
837921,BillM,2014-02-23 13:38:00,17367,"Good on your guys, I would have turned around and gone back to bed in those conditions."
837923,Joey,2014-02-23 13:43:00,9122,"Yes, that was a nasty wind yesterday.  Had to anchor my hut and it was rough setting it up and taking it down.  At least we didn't have the blowing snow you guys had.  Ain't fishing fun"
837935,NAW,2014-02-23 14:15:00,4022,"Yep.  It was an adventure!  We pulled out of Orr Lake and the roads where dry, no wind, smooth sailing.   Then I get a text from chad saying his road is in the worst condition he has ever seen in before...   Hhmmm...  Adventure time!   I think we only had to get out and push 3 or 4 times.   Hey, you gotta get a work out in somehow right!  Here's a few random pics I took during the day.   How I start most fishing mornings.   Chad setting up the Leachman Special.   Notice the direction the snow is ""falling""...   The throttle got a froze up on my auger...  So our last set up we had to manually turn holes through 3' of ice...  A lovely was to finish off the day...     Thanks for the fun times Chad!  You jeep guys really like to push your equipment!!!   It always makes for an adventure!  I too went to be early...  And up just rolling out of bed now.."
838056,Rod Caster,2014-02-24 01:23:00,5784,I sprayed down Jeep today and at least 100lbs of ice came off the undercarriage!
838060,chris.brock,2014-02-24 01:35:00,4053,"it has been a rough winter, that's for sure, that day looks like a good example, good for you guys for toughing it out, I'm sure the getting together aspect made it worthwhile"
838064,Terry,2014-02-24 01:50:00,14456,looks  like an adventure
838114,Skud,2014-02-24 12:26:00,739,Those pictures would be enough to keep most people from ever trying to go ice fishing.  BRRR!  Good on ya for giving it a go.
838134,Moosebunk,2014-02-24 15:30:00,3970,UGHH!!!  Harsh!  WHY??? lol.
838150,Cosmos,2014-02-24 16:54:00,588,"Wow, that is really cool guys. Chad, last picture is a bomb."
838233,Rustic-Fisher,2014-02-25 00:26:00,826,Love it !!!!!!! Nice work. Nice to see that jeep worked !
838238,MJL,2014-02-25 01:06:00,2427,"It's trips like these that are the most memorable. Adventure indeed!  Nick, that last picture with the auger might be one of my favourite ice fishing pictures of all time  "
838255,NAW,2014-02-25 01:52:00,4022, Jay needed a break at the halfway point.  We twisted that auger right to the handle...
