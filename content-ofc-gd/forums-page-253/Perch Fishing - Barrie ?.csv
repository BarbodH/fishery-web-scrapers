Knowing how quick he'd complain if I made him walk a half hour, I thought maybe here in Barrie would be just as productive with little walking needed.  Any tips on where to venture out from shore to hit some perch and if they are in reach within a short walk?  I'm assuming the ice in the marina area would be darn thick and the fish have moved out."

The ice is thick everywhere,I would suggest going near the ice hut operators.This past weekend was really slow.At least near them you would have a better chance of keeping him busy,if not maybe on the smaller size.Having said that these operators do not make a living on not catching anything.Good luck!!"

May need to move a short distance every hour or so if the fish turn off under the hole, and I did get into herring every half hour or so the two times I fished there this winter. Good luck fishing whereever you decide to head out to!"
