838264,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-25 03:03:00,8243,"How'd he carry the canoe on the bike? Just curious.  So I'm not the only one trying to picture this. Once he gets the canoe in the water where does the bike go? In the canoe? How else is he going to pedal not paddle back? I don't picture carrying the canoe back to the bike. I guess a light bike would go on the canoe with no problem. Probably lighter than my fishing partner who pretended to paddle. When I would turn around and look he'd say ""what""? Your paddle isn't wet that's what."
838267,SirCranksalot,2014-02-25 03:20:00,3291,"OK  Drop bike off at takeout--lock to tree Paddle downstream Unlock bike, lock canoe to tree Bike to vehicle Drive to take-out to get bike."
838318,Rich,2014-02-25 15:26:00,3927,The Nith has some great stretches too. More likely to hook into bigger smallies or a pike on the Nith than the Speed in my opinion. But it's all great water.
838333,PikeyArea,2014-02-25 15:46:00,19,It's a long river. Do you fish it down near Paris? Or further north?
838366,sofabed,2014-02-25 18:30:00,119,The Nith around the 401 and Trussler road is known for good pike and bass fishing. Fish around the bridges.
837697,PikeyArea,2014-02-22 01:33:00,19,Hey!  I hear people say they fish for bass and pike on the Grand river all the time. I just moved to Cambridge and I was wondering if someone could tell me where the better access are? I plan to fish from my canoe.  Thanks for the help!
837718,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-22 04:11:00,8243,"We are close to the lower Grand here in Haldimand. Labignon did a show a few years back getting many nice smallies from a Kayac right in your area. Can't help with access, looks to be plenty as I drive along 24 from Brantford north. Nice area, good luck."
837723,sofabed,2014-02-22 06:40:00,119,I have not fished the Grand however you can access it from the old rail trail in several places. Especially between Glenn Morris and Pairis
837730,fishing n autograph,2014-02-22 08:48:00,2540,There are thousands of places to launch. Lots of nickels in that river.
837836,PikeyArea,2014-02-23 00:36:00,19,Thanks for the help!
837896,Rich,2014-02-23 09:40:00,3927,"We always put the canoe in behind the gas station on river rd east, great stretch of river."
837968,SirCranksalot,2014-02-23 16:37:00,3291,From Glen Morris to Paris in canoe 1 Sun aft was the best bass fishing ever! The 2 of us caught 20-30!
838059,PikeyArea,2014-02-24 01:29:00,19,Thanks Rich and KnGuy!  Can you paddle back up river in either of those places? or is the current too strong?
838116,Mike Pike,2014-02-24 12:48:00,1332,"Thanks Rich and KnGuy!  Can you paddle back up river in either of those places? or is the current too strong? Hey Pikey, the stretch from Cambridge to Paris is the biggest elevation change along the Grand River.  Lots of rapids and fun paddling along there.  So if you can paddle your canoe back up river, you're a far better paddler than me!  lol"
838122,PikeyArea,2014-02-24 14:57:00,19,Haha thanks! I doubt I have the skillz required for that!
838178,fishing n autograph,2014-02-24 19:08:00,2540,I'm filling my streamer box as we speak to hit the grand and conestoga once pike season opens
838179,Christopheraaron,2014-02-24 19:14:00,3525,I'm filling my streamer box as we speak to hit the grand and conestoga once pike season opens Let me know if you need anything
838183,fishing n autograph,2014-02-24 19:35:00,2540,"Lol nope I can tie my own.... Started tying buggers, bunny leeches, clousers and double bunnies"
838184,bigugli,2014-02-24 19:37:00,6138,From Belwoods on down to Erie there is some fantastic water. It's going to take years to get to know the Grand well.
838185,Christopheraaron,2014-02-24 19:51:00,3525,"Lol nope I can tie my own.... Started tying buggers, bunny leeches, clousers and double bunnies Try some crayfish patterns as well."
838186,PikeyArea,2014-02-24 20:10:00,19,"I assume most people wade it because of the current, eh? hmm not really my style. Does anyone know of a better spot for canoe or boat? Also what about north of Cambridge?"
838188,SirCranksalot,2014-02-24 20:20:00,3291,"My friend used to take a bike with him, with his canoe on top. Then he would pedal(not paddle) back up from Paris or Glenn Morris, (depending on where he put in) along the bicycle trail(which, I believe, is paved)."
838189,fishing n autograph,2014-02-24 20:21:00,2540,Anything from Kitchener to Paris is a good go
838190,bigugli,2014-02-24 20:27:00,6138,There is some good smallie water around Brantford and down at least to York.
838191,PikeyArea,2014-02-24 20:29:00,19,epic lol
838192,PikeyArea,2014-02-24 20:33:00,19,Anything on Speed river?
838197,Rich,2014-02-24 20:55:00,3927,Smallies in all of the grand and it's tribs. More so it seems in the kitchener-paris stretch. The speed can be as good as the grand.. but really you're better off on the grand.
838223,fishing n autograph,2014-02-24 23:14:00,2540,Some spots on the conestoga but it's been heavily fished for 20 years....I'm gonna check out the Nith this year
838226,PikeyArea,2014-02-24 23:38:00,19,I wondered about the Nith too let me know how you make out
838237,Christopheraaron,2014-02-25 00:48:00,3525,"My friend used to take a bike with him, with his canoe on top. Then he would pedal(not paddle) back up from Paris or Glenn Morris, (depending on where he put in) along the bicycle trail(which, I believe, is paved). How'd he carry the canoe on the bike?
