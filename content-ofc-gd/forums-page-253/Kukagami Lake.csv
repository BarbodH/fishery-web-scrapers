837475,Steve,2014-02-20 23:14:00,2075,I have an opportunity to join a friend and fish that lake this year. (likely late spring - may'ish)  Does anyone know if there is a boat ramp on the lake that i could launch my 17' tiller? I have 4x4 truck.  Thanks!Steve   edit: Ashigami lake is also a possibility. A launch on that one?
838029,Steve,2014-02-23 22:21:00,2075,no sudbury folks floating around?  thanks in advance....
838067,solopaddler,2014-02-24 02:02:00,8605,"Was going to chime in earlier Steve. I have a buddy who lives up there who fishes that lake occasionally. I've asked him about the ramp, just waiting to hear back from him.  There is a lodge on the lake though, you could ask them?"
838070,Steve,2014-02-24 02:06:00,2075,"thanks mike, i appreciate it.  i don't know anything about the area and want to take a friend who isn't really a fisherman....  so I'm running blind.....  I saw there was a lodge on Kukagami.....but couldn't even determine if there was a launch at the lodge...figured i'd email them if I didn't get any info from here....  Ashigami appears to be a smaller lake, but still big enough, which might make it a better bet...but no idea about launching facilities.  thanks again.  cheers."
838091,BillM,2014-02-24 03:26:00,17367,Looks like the boat ramp is right off Kukagami Lake road according to Bing maps...
838121,Steve,2014-02-24 14:37:00,2075,"thanks Bill, I just checked Bing Maps...  (as I generally use Google)  How did u see the boat ramp? I was able to see Sportsman Lodge, but I wasn't able to locate a boat ramp nor a satellite view that showed a boat ramp.  Is there a way I can improve my Bing maps?"
838123,BillM,2014-02-24 14:58:00,17367,"You need to switch the view to aerial on Bing Maps.   Ramp looks like it's located on your right, about 300ft before Portage Lake Rd.  http://binged.it/1hKvBBo"
838136,Governator,2014-02-24 15:33:00,879,"There's a boat launch for Ashigami, I believe it's on the far north east side.  If you want some more info msg me, there's walleye & smallies to be had, did a weekend trip there a couple years ago.  EDIT: Not far north east side.  I'll message you directions to it."
