837552,Stoty,2014-02-21 10:18:00,2910,"I posted one of the projects I'd been working on a few weeks ago (an online fishing log) and I've had some amazing feedback from fellow members. I've even had multiple requests about making my log into an ""app"". I have looked into this, and it's just not worth it with all the setup and launching fees. The other option I have come up with is making my log available to anyone/everyone that would be interested by creating a ""membership"" based website. For a (very small) monthly fee, you can have your own personal online log setup that you would be able to access from anywhere you get a cell signal (internet access).  My question to everyone is would this be something that you would potentially use for a few bucks a month?   For more details about my log check out my original post ----> Found Here"
837554,Big Cliff,2014-02-21 11:25:00,6899,"I personally wouldn't but then I won't use Facebook or a lot of other sites or apps that I feel my information could be accessed easily by someone else. As for a fishing log; I keep most of mine in my head so it is always accessable, cell phone or not."
837561,Stoty,2014-02-21 12:45:00,2910,Data would be secured and backed up on a regular basis. No worries about losing the data.
837564,lew,2014-02-21 12:52:00,12766,"I kept a very  basic log for muskies for a lot of years but it was more just to keep track of the numbers of fish I caught from one season to another.  Date, time of day and whatever body of water I was on."
837573,BITEME,2014-02-21 13:35:00,1968,I wouldn't personally ....good idea though I like to keep it KISS (Keep it simple stupid)
837576,Fisherman,2014-02-21 13:45:00,7201,"No, my info is mine whether secure or not."
837580,BillM,2014-02-21 13:57:00,17367,"Nope, the only way I'd use this if it was a downloadable app or similar."
837591,EC1,2014-02-21 15:36:00,930,"I'd probably use it if it were a one time fee, and to be used offline. Anyways, you've got yourself a great idea, it might not be for everyone, but you should have some sort of following!"
837594,BillM,2014-02-21 16:10:00,17367,"The guys over on NPS would love this I'm sure, lol."
837597,bassassin,2014-02-21 16:27:00,152,monthly fees are a turn off for everyone!
837607,Stoty,2014-02-21 17:35:00,2910,"LOL Bill.  I'll just keep it as a personal project then, doesn't seem to be much interest."
837614,BillM,2014-02-21 18:58:00,17367,A phone app would be killer..  I'd buy that in a second.
837632,bigugli,2014-02-21 20:01:00,6138,"I keep 2 diaries for the conservation authorities every year, as well as my own personal log. I just could not see a reason to have a digital log as well."
837641,alphaalpha,2014-02-21 20:36:00,475,Id buy an app as well. A one time $5 purchase or something reasonable would do well. Monthly fees are the worst.  -AA
837642,BucktownAngler,2014-02-21 20:37:00,582,i like the app idea
837672,e-z-out,2014-02-21 22:52:00,1052,I'm in for the app idea as well
837677,misfish,2014-02-21 23:25:00,29133,"Im lucky enough I know how to click on the internet on my PC.LOL I have an old book that I use to keep all my days of fishing. Weather,water conditions,how many stacks were blowing.(oh i,ll bet thats got some wondering) Started it 1980..  Now I just go off my memory. It,s seems to be still working. My brain that is.LOL"
837678,manitoubass2,2014-02-21 23:29:00,11391,Id buy an app for that. Is it really expensive to design/license an app???(serious question)
837790,Stoty,2014-02-22 19:31:00,2910,"Yes, there's yearly fees of $100 plus registration fees as well. Plus the cost to have it developed as iOS programming is not in my list of known programming languages."
837793,BillM,2014-02-22 19:46:00,17367,"IOS? Bah, Android"
837799,nancur373,2014-02-22 21:00:00,1211,"IOS? Bah, Android X2"
837842,Stoty,2014-02-23 01:01:00,2910,Multiple platforms add to the cost. Apple would be first if I was to do it.
