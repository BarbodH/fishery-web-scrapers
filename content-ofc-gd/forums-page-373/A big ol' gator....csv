Awesome fight that included a couple muskie style launches out of the water, and 2 long runs from the side of the boat straight down to bottom. I want to catch him again when he gets even bigger!  He was 9 lbs 14 oz on the digital scale and was longer than my 32"" fish measuring sticker on the boat. Probably 33-34ish.  "
