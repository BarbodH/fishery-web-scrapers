724680,Jofitz,2012-08-24 01:29:00,5,I am not a neophyte to fishing but am unfamiliar with areas around Hamilton/Burlington that might yield a successful day of fishing for my 6 and eight year old. We have tried a few spots haphazardly while camping and at various cottages but were unsuccessful. The jokes are already starting about Dad collecting fishing equipment but never catching anything. Can anyone direct me to a spot where my kids can at least see that swimming things live under the water? I would really appreciate it. Thanks to all.

724771,ricoboxing,2012-08-24 14:18:00,398,Valens conservation area use to have lots of nice sized bluegills. Havent been there in ages.
724794,northernpike56,2012-08-24 16:14:00,717,  I used to fish there as a kid 5-6 years ago. Plenty of bluegills+perch there still.
724904,express168,2012-08-24 22:37:00,327,"Valens for sure, even Binbrook Conservation. If you can rent one of the row boats and drop a hook and worm there are plenty of fish and the chance for some decent bass. If the kids get too hot then you could hit the beach."
724955,Jofitz,2012-08-25 07:37:00,5, Binbrook it is. The rowboats sound like a great idea. Thanks much.
724979,Acountdeleted,2012-08-25 13:48:00,2562,Hamilton harbour can be a lot of fun right before bedtime. Take some worms and hula-poppers out there.
725024,jedimaster,2012-08-25 17:16:00,3472,"Is it called Valley Inn road? I used to take the kids there to fish for catfish. Certainly nothing I would keep, but the kids loved watching them wiggle around. haha Catfish creep me out."
725032,Jofitz,2012-08-25 18:16:00,5,"Thanks Jedi, I hear you but it will work for the kids. Much appreciated."
725468,jedimaster,2012-08-27 17:11:00,3472,a worm on a small hook with a split shot cast it out on the north side of the  and let it sit on the bobber and give it to one of the kids to hold onto. the catfish put up a good tussle in the hands of a child.
