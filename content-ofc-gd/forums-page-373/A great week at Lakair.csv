725116,irishfield,2012-08-26 01:05:00,26272,"BTW Joey, Leah says it was bad enough that I was taking pictures of her   and posting them here.... but you doing it now has her scared!"
721962,Joey,2012-08-12 00:50:00,9122,"We arrived at Lakair on Saturday the 4th and it was HOT and HUMID.  The bonus, my son came with us for the first time.  He was not sure what to expect, but let me tell you, he said he has never laughed so hard in his life and absolutely loved the place!!!!   We went down and saw Lew, Diane and Marv and within 1/2 an hour, I had to change into my bathing suit and take Ralphie swimming, it was that hot.  Sleeping that night was restless due to the heat, then in the middle of the night a big thunder boomer woke everyone up just for good measure to make sure it was a sleepless night all around     Heck, I enjoyed it so that's all that matters, I love a good storm (Ralphie, not so much).  So good to see you Lew and Di, can't wait to see you again and Di, I enjoyed our quiet time chats very much  We had some interesting neighbours this time in cabin 9 (we were in cabin 8), Bruno and Mary.  Mary was quite the interesting character (not to everyone's taste) but she was very entertaining to say the least.  Apparently, I am her new BFF  Art and Joe showed up Sunday to a great day of sunshine, laughs and a few wobblies.  Here are some pics at the beginning of our trip:  Me, Mary and Paul with Ralphie on his lap.    Art and Lew yakking it up in Art and Joe's boat.    Diane not too impressed with Mary's antics that day     I told them all to smile for the next shot, that is my son Alan on the left, then Diane and Mary.    Paul and Al    Bruno and Joe    Joe, ever the entertainer      Art    Roy and J showed up Monday and joined in the festivities    Roy's son Phil also showed up on his motorcycle.  I had met him before once at the fishing show in Toronto.  He and Al shared a cabin.  Great seeing you and hanging out with you again Phil    J and Phil in the cabin    Mmmmmmmmmmm, Apple Pie    We had a HUGE thunderstorm that night just as dinner was being finished on the picnic table.  Lost power a few times.  I took a few shots after the storm.      Ooooooooh, double rainbow     TJ, Monique, Jaden and Avery stopped by for a night aswell, but just for a few hours and then off they went.  Didn't end up getting any pics of their visit     Loved talking to you guys again.  Hope you are enjoying Jiggy Jiggy right now  We hung out in the cabin one night to get away from mosquitos and rain, checking funny videos on the internet and just hanging out.  Many jokes were told              The weather kind of went for a crap after that and it pretty much rained the rest of the trip.  Paul, Al and I trolled in the rain for a bit and caught nothing, but had a nice time.  I got a few wildlife shots:                We couldn't tell if this was a huge dead musky head or a deadhead.  Pretty sure it is a deadhead log but sure looks like it could be the other eh!!!     After all the late nights and constant traffic in and around our cabin, I let the boys fish by themselves a few times, but no musky were caught.  Roy wanted a fish fry and the Virginia boys had caught a few the day before, so we went on a quest and Paul caught a few small to medium pike, then I got a half decent one, then Alan caught the biggest one.  He was thrilled and that ignited the fisherman in him and he was hooked from there on.              Ralphie on his perch:    The fish fry     Al fishing off the dock with Paul giving some tips    Art fishing off the dock     Wayne and Leah showed up for a night and we had some great laughs with them.  Great seeing you two again          Gotta love when a woman takes the weeds off your lure eh hahahahahahaaha!!!!!!!      The boats:          Once again, a great time up at Lakair.  Moe and her friend and kids showed up, and Lego the dog.  Great to see you again Moe and meet your friend.  Thanks so much Leslie and Kev, and hope all is well     Please let me know okay!   Great time and best of times with the OFC crew once again.  A great big thank you has to go out to Roy and J, especially J, for her excellent cooking.  We ate like kings mostly due to her cooking.   Totally awesome hon, thanks!  Joey"

722305,Roy,2012-08-13 18:35:00,13728,"J, Phil and myself had a great time at Lakair. It was a short visit but it was fun. Really nice to catch up with some old  friends as well. I didn't take very many pictures at all but managed to find these on my camera.  This is Joey and Wayne.    Leah and myself, I have no idea who took the pic.    Here's one of Joe with a fine looking pike.    My son Phil relaxing.    J with a Nipissing smallie, Actually she caught a few of those.    My trophy for the week of course. (Stop it Terry, I can hear you laughing from here!)    Here's a water snake lazing on a rock. I know it's a water snake cause he couldn't possibly have walked out to the  rock.      I hope I can get up there for longer next year."
722308,Joey,2012-08-13 18:51:00,9122,"Those are awesome pics Roy, really nice  Had such a great time with you, J and Phil.  Can't wait to do it again!!!!!!!"
722310,misfish,2012-08-13 18:57:00,29133,"Great post J. Pics are awesome.  Roy,you look MA VO LUS.   Maybe next year."
722317,aplumma,2012-08-13 19:20:00,6896,A great time and good people is all I can say. Thanks for the photos both of you. BTW the flaw in your assumption that it is a water snake is even land based snakes don't walk.   I sure miss the evening chats where the beer makes this kind of debate make perfect sense.   Art
722320,misfish,2012-08-13 19:31:00,29133,"I meant to ask,,,,,,,,,,,who dem grey haired southern byes?"
722321,aplumma,2012-08-13 19:36:00,6896,  A few more weeks up North and I am sure the hair would be black again Brian. So maybe next year you can get your butt up there to fish with the Best? We look forward to it when it happens bud  Art
