724762,irishfield,2012-08-24 13:43:00,26272,No need to ruin Rick's family vacation thread....
724765,Rod Caster,2012-08-24 14:00:00,5784, I'm talking up his vacation grounds...no ruining here
724891,spincast,2012-08-24 21:52:00,3279,"  Glad you enjoyed the gift. I figured it was only aged half as much as your and Leah's marriage, so actually it was little young.   It was also a thanks - for all the other offers and help with this trip, as you well know. As for your busy calendar - no need to apologise at all. We truly enjoyed the times visiting - and hope to be able to do so again - and meet Jen.

725011,spincast,2012-08-25 16:13:00,3279,"and the correct place for that Walleyemaster, if you didnt get the two previous hints about hijacking my thread, is your own post. shees. -"
725028,Spiel,2012-08-25 17:32:00,9065,A shame how this is going.  Great report Rick and thanks for sharing your family vacation with us.

722399,spincast,2012-08-14 00:19:00,3279,"In March as the taste of spring entered the air the clan gathered round to vote for the family cottage get away.  After much discussion Temagami won out. Scenery, fishing and a little help locating a place sealed the deal. This week is one where fishing plays a role, but time with the family is the primary reason and time away from work and its embedded blackberry are savoured.  Last time we were up in Temagami was 2010. The fishing was good and G-man got introduced to something other than sunfish off the dock with a float.  He struggled feeling fish on the jig and got hung up or gave his worm away more often than not. Frustration was not far off when I introduced him to worm harnesses and his love of trolling was born. His sister has always had the touch,be it casting, jigging, or drifting. This year his sister is 13 and lets say interest in fishing, and lamoist anything I understand seems to have waned for the moment. Hopefully it will return. G was equipped with a new light, fast action set up and taught himself  to jig after  a couple pointers, watching the bass in the clear shallow waters.  The fishing wasn't as good this year but we all still had success and enjoyed ourselves.Here's a few moments with family, friends and scenery - all of which were great.  Family vacation equals at least one day of tubing   Steph got a new camera and wanted to try the action shots,        The weather wasnt great, with fronts blowing through almost daiily, and rain on 2 days. Thursday was a torrential down pour spouting funnel clouds. That shut them down. But on Monday a OFC friend showed up and took us out to a fishing spot - sharing OFC fishing stories the whole way ""that's Moosebunk rock; that's where Lloyd caught his big fish; that spot there will take your lower end out, Joey and Paul got some good one's here......."" A great opportunity to see and experience the lake through the eyes of a resident.   he put us on a couple of fish      G was thrilled to meet Wayne again after all their post exchanges. Thanks Wayne - really enjoyed our visits.  G is taking canoe camp this year and took an opportunity to practice his skills   G really wanted a chance to use his stringer he got this year,   Having some fun with the morinng catch before the meeting mack the knife.  and a few shots of Temagami to sign off.    I can never get enough of this scenery      moon rise through the trees sitting on the deck  time to hang it up till next time    "
722450,Musky or Specks,2012-08-14 03:24:00,2710,So nice to get away with your family and not many better spots to do it than Temagami.
722459,solopaddler,2012-08-14 09:43:00,8605,"Great pic's and even better smiles, looks like a great trip. Where did you guys stay on Temagami?"
722460,Roy,2012-08-14 10:23:00,13728,Good stuff! Looks as though the young'ns had a super time. Thanks for sharing that.
722461,spincast,2012-08-14 10:27:00,3279,  Thanks for the comments Mike. PM sent
722463,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-14 10:36:00,2690,"Some great family shots, Rick!!  Once again the smiles say it all."
722489,Rod Caster,2012-08-14 13:32:00,5784,I love that photo of G and his Sis in the tube  pure fun!  It's pretty cool that Wayne showed up...it's like he circles the lake seeking out OFC members haha.  Thanks for the awesome report.
722503,Moosebunk,2012-08-14 14:28:00,3970,I think the kiddies will be high on happiness for a good long while after that family trip.  Great read and pics.  Trying to think which rock??? lol.
722846,Leecher,2012-08-16 00:38:00,7832,Thats' Awesome Rick   Looks like the perfect place for a family getaway    Thanks for taking the time to post and share the pics with us Jacques
722858,Joey,2012-08-16 01:07:00,9122,"WOW, what a great report and super awesome pictures.   Yes, we did get a few good ones at that rock  Glad you had such a good time up there and I really love the action shots off the dock"
722861,walleyemaster,2012-08-16 01:10:00,325,as long as you guys stay away from my spots we will be ok...lol nice pics
722904,Broker,2012-08-16 12:03:00,482,beautfiil shots ! Looks like a fun time had by everyone  thanks for posting!
722969,mirogak,2012-08-16 19:14:00,387,excellent pics and fish .... tubing is awesome.
722982,bigbuck,2012-08-16 19:39:00,2449,Great pics and report. Good to see our Irish friend is still alive and well during his well earned disappearing act.
723155,Live2fish85,2012-08-17 02:55:00,1633,Awesome report Rick. Some awesome shots you got there.  Nice fish on top of all.
724679,irishfield,2012-08-24 01:28:00,26272,Wish we hadn't been rushed Rick! I had the entire week book marked until my Niece wanted to come up with my two great nieces. At least I found two fish....  Also... the 30th anniversary gift for Leah and I was extremely over the top from your family and MUCH appreciated.  I'll try to find some time over the weekend to add some of my pics I got of your gang!
724691,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 02:00:00,5865,"This area (Temagami) has ALWAYS sparked my interest, but every time I follow any of these threads for more fishing info I only see small or few fish caught...maybe I'm just not seeing the good thread on this area."
724694,irishfield,2012-08-24 02:12:00,26272,"They are called eaters Bob... we let the trophies go ! Have you missed my winter threads... with 4' lakers and such?.. or Walleyemasters sinks full of 'eyes for dinner?  It can be a tough lake to crack... 3500 miles of shoreline and as many shoals to search, learn and TRY to conquer."
724726,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 10:47:00,5865,"But it just a fraction of the water I fish in Lake Erie, with most times much better results."
724746,Rod Caster,2012-08-24 12:56:00,5784,I'd take the fish in Wayne screen shot before that dinky pike in yours any day
724749,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 13:02:00,5865," But he who laughs last, laughs BEST.....  :rofl2: "
724753,Rod Caster,2012-08-24 13:07:00,5784,"haha. That fish is only there because all the natural fish from that lake are long gone. Just in case you forgot, this is what a real pike looks like...from the Temagami area.  "
724754,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 13:09:00,5865,Still small compared to many of my fish...  :rofl2:
724755,Rod Caster,2012-08-24 13:16:00,5784,  ...%50 of those fish is heavy metals; of course they would be heavier
724756,Lip-ripper,2012-08-24 13:31:00,228,"The good thing about Lake Erie is, while you troll, you can use the lake water to develop film or bottle it for use as an effective Drano substitute.  p.s. Great report!"
