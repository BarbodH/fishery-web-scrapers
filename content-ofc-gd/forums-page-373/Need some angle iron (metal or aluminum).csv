724734,RangerGuy,2012-08-24 12:07:00,564,"Anybody got a short piece of 4"" angle iron lying around they want to get rid of? I only need 2-3' feet of it."
724735,Fisherman,2012-08-24 12:09:00,7201,Best deal is probably old bedframes you can get at the restore/recycle place.
724737,NAW,2012-08-24 12:10:00,4022,"What thickness?  Might have a chunk laying around.  If not, metal supermarkets will have something."
724766,RangerGuy,2012-08-24 14:02:00,564,"I'd say no less than 1/16"" or 1/8. It's just for mounting my quickset blind to the lund brackets"
724768,danc,2012-08-24 14:07:00,4677,I think that Canadian tire sells 3 foot pieces of angle iron.

724775,RangerGuy,2012-08-24 14:33:00,564,Thnx  If I can't find any I'll have to hit MetalSuper Market
724776,cheaptackle,2012-08-24 14:38:00,849,Try Bayview Boats - North end of the Southbound side of Gasoline Alley (he builds huge custom aluminums).  I picked up some plate from him VERY CHEAP$$$$$.  Bring small bills - he didn't have any change when I was there so he cut the price even more!  Now I feel guilty!  Michael
724782,ctered,2012-08-24 14:55:00,40,"What do you mean by 4""? Is that 4"" x 4"" x 3ft. I probably have 2"" and maybe 3"" but 4"" is getting big for angle iron."
724785,Dara,2012-08-24 15:12:00,3052,"I have from 1x1x1/8 up to 8x8x1...up to a hundred feet of each size...what do you want  edit, you can't get 1/8, it starts at 1/4 for 4x4. I can bend the 1/8 though"
724790,craigdritchie,2012-08-24 15:51:00,1586,Home Depot?
724818,krixxer,2012-08-24 17:30:00,274,i have scraps but I don't think you want to come to mississauga for a 5$ L bracket.
724821,davey buoy,2012-08-24 17:36:00,5505," For that size your pretty well limited to a place like Metal Supermarket or The Metal Place on steeles in Brampton, may have a off cut. Not sure where your located?"
724841,RangerGuy,2012-08-24 18:48:00,564,Ok so I just remeasured the mounting bases for my blind.  The angle iron would have to be 4 X 3 inches. Here is a pic of the bracket.  It's kind of hard to explain but this bracket is meant to be bolted to bench seats or a raised deck of some kind. It allows the blind to fold down towards the bow for driving and storage. My plan is to get 4 L shaped pieces of the appropriate size and bolt them to the lund sport brackets then bolt this to the L shaped piece so I can fully remove the blind in fishing season  I'm thinking it might just be easier to take a drive to the metal place with bracket in hand.  
724854,Dara,2012-08-24 19:17:00,3052,"  Thats an extrusion, not an angle"
724877,RangerGuy,2012-08-24 20:47:00,564,"I think I may need a different mounting method, I better fully assemble this thing before I decide on how I'm gonna mount it.. I looks like it's going to be way to high."
725036,Sinker,2012-08-25 18:25:00,8692," Thats what I was thinking. Mine is mounted to the front deck, and rear benches. I don't have a quickset.....same deal, only I made mine. I think its better myself. A lot cheaper, that's for sure!  S."
725473,RangerGuy,2012-08-27 17:39:00,564,"Got my material from Steel SuperMarket in Vaughan.  Yeh, I would have prefer'd to build my own, but time is closing and I just don't have the time to build one. It took me way to long to get my truck all fixed up this year   Thanks for the help everyone"
