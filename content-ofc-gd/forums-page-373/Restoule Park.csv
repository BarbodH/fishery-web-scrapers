725258,DMASSE,2012-08-26 19:11:00,420,"Hello  Well we just got back from Restoule last week,  As Dave Bailey posted the water was alittle rough but I managed to head out everyday mostly 2 hours before dark into the night on my fishing Kayak..    The Camp site was nice, and neighbour  and fellow OFNer was right across from us. (DAVE BAILEY)  I managed to catch some nice bass,  I ended up catching 5 walleyes jigging at dusk in 20ft of water with a rapala jigging minnow.  Marked tons of fish between 20-45ft of water...  On a day trip I found a great little trout stream, full of rainbows, and below the dam some nice bass, and rock bass...  Tons of wildlife, multiple pics of deer, raccoons, water snakes, and even a encounter with a bear...  Again a quick sorry to Dave for the noise (2 teenagers and a 10y)  and I hope you end up getting your stuff back....  It was nice meeting you and your family...  Dave"
