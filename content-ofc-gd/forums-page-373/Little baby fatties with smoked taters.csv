I used 10# of Jimmy Dean sausage and added 3# hamburger, a chopped onion, some rub and Montreal steak spice.  I then stuffed them with aged gouda and put a couple of strips of bacon around them.    Threw em on the smoker for a couple of hours or so.    When they were done, I put a chunk of Chipoltle Jack cheese on.    Then I made a batch of extra creamy mashed potatoes.  Lots of butter, sour cream, cream cheese and fresh chive.    I used yukon gold potatoes and gave em a half hour smoke.     Smoked taters just rock my world.    Thanks to Toad Hunter for the great idea."
