724099,lickmyarmpit,2012-08-21 02:27:00,359,I'll buy if there for sale......
724101,Stoty,2012-08-21 02:36:00,2910," You've got that right!!!!!!!!! Since my name was the first mentioned.... I believe that gives me the right to call ""shotgun"" on them!"
724103,Acountdeleted,2012-08-21 02:39:00,2562,Wouldn't that be a kick in the teeth if the season was canceled?
724106,Stoty,2012-08-21 02:44:00,2910,"You'll get refunded for the ticket prices, if the season is cancelled."
724110,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-21 03:03:00,2690,Will be a moot point if the spoiled brats (owners and players) can't get their act together.  I'm ready for a season of junior hockey this year.
724114,backbay,2012-08-21 03:19:00,773,Second prize is 8 tickets?
724665,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 00:44:00,5865,Leaf tickets.......  ....how do you consider that a WIN....  Almost like winning the right for Bills tickets....
724678,irishfield,2012-08-24 01:25:00,26272,"A win to me is being one of the few that have already stood at center ice in the NEW Maple Leaf Gardens... Ryerson's ""Mattamy Centre at the Gardens"""
724682,SirCranksalot,2012-08-24 01:31:00,3291,"  That's gotta be some kind of bad April fools joke---a few months too late, just like the Leafs!!."
724748,tb4me,2012-08-24 13:01:00,3295,Tell that to the 700 hundred thousand or so fans that want one of the 100 hundred thousand tickets avaiable..Now try that at a Bills game...lol
724752,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 13:05:00,5865," And how many MILLIONS are in metropolitan Toronto....compared to 265,000 residents in Buffalo......  ...also take into consideration that the Leafs sell what....25,000 tickets per game while the Bills sell close to 80,000 seats for each game...."
724757,torco,2012-08-24 13:32:00,656,"I got drawn to spend my money on Monday and was allowed to purchase up to 4 tickets. Here's the thing the thing though I bought 2 tickets for a friend and then another friend got back to me later in the day and also wanted 2 tickets, which I thought I could do but I didn't read the fine print. You are only allowed to make one transaction on the day so after I bought the first 2 tickets I was no longer eligible.  Also you are required to buy one of the other games as well. So all in all for 2 tickets it was $400 bucks. Thankfully for me I am not spending that money but my friend is, I was fortunate enough to get some corporate seats for the game.  Also since there is a good chance it will not happen, no need to worry you will get a full refund if the game is cancelled for any reason including weather."
724761,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 13:43:00,5865," You're a good friend, my friend....LOL  Now just hope they win those games......"
724770,ricoboxing,2012-08-24 14:15:00,398,You won the right to resell those tix and profit!
724798,irishfield,2012-08-24 16:29:00,26272,Not a sole on the team that will get their sweaty mitts on this one... the trophy either!!

724901,misfish,2012-08-24 22:24:00,29133, Here here.  Bettman needs a kick in the teeth. Wonder what a charity could make from buying tickets to that event.  That guy couldnt hold his nose any higher.
