The month started off with a couple club tournaments on Gloucester Pool and Lake Muskoka.  G-Pool was some of the worst weather I've fished in in a while.  It was blowing 30-40km/h all day and the rain came down HEAVY at times, with thunderstorms threatening all day.  I managed to scrape together a semi-decent limit, but one dead fish cost me big time.  The tournament was so tight that the 0.5lbs penalty dropped me 5 places in the standings.  Lake Muskoka was a different ball game.  The weather was changing all day, but some experience on the lake helped me out.  It was a tough go, as Lake Muskoka often is in August, but we put close to 25 fish in the boat and managed a second place finish.  No big fish, just consistancy.  Got most of the smallies fishing whatever weed clumps we could find with a mix of spinnerbaits and Slammers on a dropshot rig.  Next up was a BPS tournament on Gloucester Pool again.  With the conditions being more ideal, Mike and I were able to fish the zones we wanted to and put together a 17+ pound limit, good enough for 2nd place.  We got all of our fish in deep milfoil on 1/2oz and 5/8oz green pumpkin jigs.  Finally, I had a couple days off to fish my favourite lake.  I'd only been out there once for fun all season so I was excited to get out there and do some damage.  On Thursday, I targetted the deep milfoil and some rock piles I had located mid lake.  Both spots put out great quality fish in good numbers.  I had planned on fishing Simcoe the next day, but I decided to get back out there while the bite was hot.  Glad I did!  I had another awesome day out and landed a largie close to 6lbs on camera.  Most fish came on black jigs, but some on dropshot, senkos and craws.  Enjoy!
