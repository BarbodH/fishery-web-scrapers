725179,Billy Bob,2012-08-26 12:32:00,5865, OK Simon.......after I collect I'll let you know how much is your half...
725195,Sinker,2012-08-26 13:59:00,8692,"  Well, if you win, you might have enough to pay the launch fees  S."
724497,ch312,2012-08-23 02:29:00,1590," well, not those that know what they're doing.    launching solo is about 3 minutes, depending on how far away i have to park. i was pondering the idea about unhooking the winch so the boat floats right off. then i just have to walk back and tie to the dock eliminating the winch procedure and time involved with that.  i'm borderline OCD when it comes to efficiency, but i can't get around launching without the winch hooked up."
724500,LefroyFisherman,2012-08-23 03:00:00,602,"ch312, read my post above, to cut down launch time"
724519,smally21,2012-08-23 12:21:00,993,alot of boaters dont want their boat on shore.
724527,Luke V.,2012-08-23 12:59:00,286,"I have a good system down. Do the same routine everytime I launch the boat. Doesnt matter where I launch. Might only be a 14 fotter by I like to take care of my gear.  My Routine is as follows.  Undo lights, Undo transom saver, undo gunnel strap, tie on bumpers (dependant on dock side), Tie on ropes(one on the stern, one just befroe the bow), Unhook safety chain and winch, Put the plug in. The I do a ounce around the make sure I have all my safety/fishing gear. Back up to the ramp and stop just as the stern is in the water. If I am alone, walk onto the dock use the ropes to slide off the boat and tie it up. If I am with someone else, the grab the ropes and I push from the bow.  I have never been to or seen a ramp that the boat may slide of the trailer early. If I had a roller trailer that would be a different story. Keeping a routine makes the proccess efficent and ensures that somethings dont get forgotten. (like putting the plug in)  Retrieving is very much the same, line the boat up with the bunks. Walk the winch line out, hook on and pull it on. My feet never get wet, I have attached a 2""x10"" plank from the tounge of the trailer right to the end. (one of the best things I have done to the boat)"
724544,Rich Clemens,2012-08-23 14:14:00,3131,I have bunk on my trailer.  I typically wait until I have my trailer down the ramp and in the water before releasing the winch strap.  Never had a problem with bunks as the others have stated.
724548,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-23 14:34:00,535,"I always leave the winch strap on until my trailor is in enough water that if the boat slide off the trailor it would float, it just gives me peace of mind. I know a guy who's boat slid off his bunk trailor while going down a steep ramp (where I often launch) and that was enough for me to take the extra precaution, especially since I often launch by myself. His boat is a LOT bigger than mine too haha."
724550,RangerGuy,2012-08-23 14:38:00,564,"My buddy did this to my ranger (we had the same boat 680t 2 model years difference). He did this on his boat all the time so did it on mine. Late November on the second day of the weekend fishing trip we changed lakes and as he backed up the hull let loose on the bunks and we almost dumped my ranger on the concrete launch.  I heard a loud crack, guess it was the ice on the bunks letting go and my boat went flying, luckily he felt it let go and gunned it in reverse shooting my boat into the water, it was a very close call. Boy did that wake me up LOL!  Needless to say mine is attached until she's in the water."
724579,J.C.,2012-08-23 16:33:00,11,On my Lund I have a roller trailer and she rolled off one time at Big Shute. Never leave it unstrapped again!  On my Stratos it is a bunk trailer. Without water its not coming off unless you do some seriously crazy driving. Bunks have so much grip I added sliders. Only bought enough to do the first 1/2 of the trailer. I still find it hard to push off or wench in on some ramps. Going to add sliders to the rest of the trailer should make life easier for me.
724581,NAW,2012-08-23 16:49:00,4022,"  X2..  But I run a VW Golf, and 14' tinner.  So I don't mind running the boat up onto shore.  I wouldn't be doing that at a concrete launch with a fancy fishing boat."
724586,fishboy,2012-08-23 17:17:00,550,"I leave the winch strap attached until the stern is over water, then unhook it and tie the long bow line to the trailer.  Back the rest of the way in, stop quickly and the boat slides off.  Once the bow line tightens, slowly pull back up a bit and the boat comes back to the base of the ramp."
724628,ch312,2012-08-23 22:19:00,1590," with the old tinner that would have been fine, but definitely not with my current boat.  i'm glad i started this thread as it appears that boats do indeed slide off bunks sometimes and i now know that i'll never do it again."
724635,frodobuggins,2012-08-23 23:03:00,127," Oh man i read the title wrong. I thought it said ""lunching""  So hungry now...."
724645,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 00:08:00,5865,NOW we need a 3 page thread on how to retrieve....after all this is what holds up the launches....
724876,ch312,2012-08-24 20:44:00,1590, still waiting for you to start that one...
724985,pikehunter,2012-08-25 14:07:00,1659,"Just lke Lefroy said.  I've never had a boat larger or heavier than a 16' tinny with a 25 on it. but did just like that, a rope that's just long enough tied off to the upright on the trailer, unhooked winch and back her down, a light tap on the brake peddle, boat floats free but still secure. Exit vehicle, grab the tied off line while passing the hitch onto the dock, tie it off and park. Less then 5 minutes done and on my way. I could do it solo with ease and at times more efficient than if I had a dockhand. (Wife, son ya know what I mean)  Sometimes it's more difficult to launch when a ""helpful"" stranger lends a hand! But I never refused assistance.  Now that the boat is sold one thing I don't miss is the inconsiderate idiots who tie up the ramp uncovering, uhooking and loading gear right at the ramp entrance. It happened so many times last year. It's even worse if you're on the water waiting for your turn and incoming boats are coming in waiting to delaunch and try to jump ahead of you."
725013,Sinker,2012-08-25 16:23:00,8692,"First thing I do is unhook the winch strap. Been launching boats for a long time, and many different types, sizes, styles, and never had one come off a BUNK trailer. Rollers is a different story.  I do like Lefroy. Unhook everything, tie my bow rope to the trailer, and drop it in. If someone is with me, I get them to back me in, while I'm in the boat.   Here is a test. Pull down the launch until your almost in the water. Put some slack in your winch strap, and just try to push your boat off the trailer......good luck!! Its not happening! You can't make it come off, I will bet my paycheck on it!!   S."
725014,Billy Bob,2012-08-25 16:31:00,5865," Shayne, when and where can I pick up your pay check......as I do this EVERY TIME I launch my boat...remember, my hubs never get wet...  ...maybe next month Simon (Pikeslayer)  can do one of his videos of me launching my boat....BTW how much do you make and I hope you only get paid once a month...."
725034,Sinker,2012-08-25 18:19:00,8692,"No vids, no pay!!"
725039,pics,2012-08-25 18:56:00,1268,Try launching at fishmasters in Dunnville without the strap....I dare ya!!
725041,Spiel,2012-08-25 19:01:00,9065, LOL  Always launch there without the strap but the safety chain stays on till the boat is over water.   
725077,Pikeslayer,2012-08-25 21:25:00,1443, I'll bring the camera for video evidence + take half from who ever wins
725085,mike rousseau,2012-08-25 22:42:00,4661,Boats have slid off trailers in the past... That's a fact... I don't care what the situations were when it happened... That's enough for me to always leave the strap on the boat until its in deep enough...  Why wouldn't you?  It takes 10 seconds to hop out and remove it...  I have rollers so it's not a choice... The strap has to stay on...  And that's the advice I give others...
725089,davey buoy,2012-08-25 22:55:00,5505, Dare you to try Sturgeon Point marina in Wasaga beach:whistling:Nasty steep!!
725092,SlowPoke,2012-08-25 22:59:00,2984,Port Stanley is the worst I've encountered. Water comes over the transom because there isn't enough hull in the water yet to displace the weight!
725178,Billy Bob,2012-08-26 12:32:00,5865," LOL  But I do agree with you Sinker......bunk trailered boats need a push to get them off the trailer....UNLIKE roller trailers...but mine is set up to be pushed off pretty easy, even though is well over 1000 lbs......"
724295,ch312,2012-08-22 02:06:00,1590,on sunday i went to burwell to get some pickerel and the guy that was working at the launch suggested i unhook the winch strap before backing into the water. i tried it out and it worked on a steep ramp. still didn't like the idea.  it's a g3 angler 165 on bunks. is it safe to unhook everything when launching or was my near nervous breakdown justified?
724296,Rich,2012-08-22 02:16:00,3927,"I always do and have.. 16ft steel duck boat, never had a problem."
724297,ccmtcanada,2012-08-22 02:20:00,7971,"I've seen it done both ways. For my own peace of mind, I unhook everything but my winch strap and unhook it when the trailer is in the water and my feet don't get wet.  May save you 10 seconds, but I have this vision of my boat sliding off as I back up even though I know the weight of it won't really allow that to happen."
724298,Pikeslayer,2012-08-22 02:20:00,1443,I don't like the idea either. I always unwinch at the water and my feet never get wet. Does the guy working the launch own a nice boat??
724300,mercman,2012-08-22 02:25:00,7054,it would take a lot of momentum to cause your boat to slide off bunks.Rollers are a different story though
724301,Bondar,2012-08-22 02:30:00,817,"I've seen about half a dozen boats come off the trailer onto the launch at queenston launch in the winter with ice , but never in the warmer weather , make sure you don't have those easy load teflon strips on your bunks they are pretty slick as well"
724303,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-22 02:32:00,1107, several for many many years both burwell launches are run by great people. if it's a steep ramp then Ron or his son know what they are doing although I leave the straps on until it's in the water if it's steep .
724311,Raf,2012-08-22 04:12:00,3495,I thought thats how you're supposed to do it with a bunk trailer?  Never seen/launched with the winch strap attached.  Never seen/dropped the boat off the bunks either.
724314,soobnoob,2012-08-22 04:46:00,55,"I always used to have the winch strap attached... Until one day I watched someone else unattach theirs before lauching and actually braked hard when he backed it up. His braking hard was actually his way of helping his boat slide off the bunks by itself. It was the fastest most efficient launch I've ever seen. No getting feet wet, no need to push off nothing."
724325,mike rousseau,2012-08-22 11:08:00,4661,I have roller bunks... My straps stay on till the motor is over the water... It can be annoying.... But I can launch in really really shallow water....
724327,Roy,2012-08-22 11:13:00,13728,I have bunks. I do a quick walk around (away from the ramp) and the very first thing I do is take strap off and snap the boat line on. Have always done it that way and never had a problem.
724329,DanD,2012-08-22 11:33:00,2223,"When I had mine I’d unhook the winch; but I tied a bow line to the trucks bumper with a bit of slack. Enough slack that the boat could freely float off the trailer but not so much that if the boat began to slide off, the line would hold it. A bit of insurance and a lot of ease, being able to grab the line well out of the water and guide the boat to the dock. I actually had a hoop tied in the line at the right distance from the boat that I would just slide this hoop over the end of the truck’s bumper. No messing around tying and untying the line from the truck.  Dan."
724331,doubleheader,2012-08-22 11:52:00,497,"Whether or not this is safe is dependent on your particular set-up. I'd say most bunk trailers you would have no problem. The only folks I have ever heard having problems with bunks are guys who have added to plastic strips to their bunks or sprayed them with lubricate. My suggestion would be take off the winch strap but leave the emergency chain attached, back down the ramp and tap the brakes until you can determine how much force is required to slide your boat off your trailer. Just remember, once the bunks are wet the boat will slide easier. I have a roller trailer under my current boat, so this isn't an option for me, but with past boats I always unhooked everything but the emergency strap, it really only takes a few seconds to unclip that once you're transom is in the water."
724334,dave524,2012-08-22 12:44:00,4508,I would never undo my winch line until I was over water with my roller trailer for no one. I put a bow line on before undoing the winch line cause any slope to the ramp it wants to go.
724341,Billy Bob,2012-08-22 13:19:00,5865,Either way...........just don't get the hubs wet...
724345,Garnet,2012-08-22 13:50:00,2056,The best thing is 2 people 1 in the boat 1 backing up. Even before the wife could back up the trailer I would position the boat undo the winch strap and the wife would back up 2-3 ft.  I assume this ramp is so steep that undoing the strap is hard and then the boat shoots of the trailer.  The worst thing is tying a rope to the boat and letting it shoot of the trailer. Seen several wives get pulled into the water. Most are those ramps with quick drop right at that critical time.  Have also seen straps and ropes break from boats shooting off trailers.
724347,whiskywizard,2012-08-22 13:54:00,305, Good question. It's easy for the other guy to advise you on how to operate your equipment.
724359,smally21,2012-08-22 15:41:00,993,"I recommend this to my customers as well, sort of.  I leave about 2 feet of slack on the winch line then lock it again. back the boat up and it gently pulls away from the winch stops. then i just climb into the boat from the back of the truck, unhooking the strap on the way past..I used to do morning clinics on this at marinas. If a guy wants to learn they can be very receptive, if you offer help at the ramp i find you are most likely to get an earful from an already stressed/embarrassed guy.  even with other people around i launch and load myself. its a routine that one needs to have, and follow each time. as helpful and experienced others may be, i prefer to stick to the routine and if something goes wrong it was me...  boats stick like crazy to regular carpeted bunks. when we pull boats off bunk trailers to dry store it takes a tug of war between 2 trucks to do so..but i still wouldn't take an unrestrained boat down a launch.  if you leave the winch strap fully tightened on a steep ramp the bow eye can wedge itself under the top roller or vstop as the boat tries to float, can get you bound up pretty good. consider the upforce on the stop is equivalent to the weight of all the water the bow is displacing, adds up pretty quick.  a little slack prevents this, and locking the winch prevents something bad happening..  i do the same on a roller, only needs a few inches of slack. no reason to tie to truck or other object the winch will restrain the boat and your secondary chain/rope doesnt come off til in the water either..unless it is very short for some reason..  launching should be a <5 minute event. recovery just a little longer."
724443,ch312,2012-08-22 22:03:00,1590,"thanks for all the input.  i'm good at launching/loading as i often fish alone and am usually quicker on my own than other guys with 2-3 people. i've always unhooked everything except for the winch line, backed down the ramp, and then released the winch to let the boat float off the trailer. but, this is sometimes a pain as i can't get to the winch without getting wet or climbing on the truck.  after reading some of the responses here i think i'll leave the winch hooked up for peace of mind"
724453,Dutch,2012-08-22 22:37:00,831,"Leaving bow strap attached to prevent boat from floating away when launching on your own is a good idea.  Leaving bow strap attached for peace of mind thinking that will prevent it from sliding off the bunks backing down to the ramp is a bit of a stretch as that would never happen unless someone puts sliders on the bunks or lubricant, both of which are stupid.  Different story with a roller trailer.  If you can launch on your own faster than 2 people you are doing exceptional.  When launching with a buddy - everything comes undone, buddy backs trailer down to water, boat comes off, trolling motor comes down to get the boat away from the ramp, buddy parks truck/trailer, I pick him up at the dock and away we go.  Process takes maybe a minute in total.  When launching solo - everything comes undone except bow strap, which is loosened off about 2 feet.  I back in until the boat slides slowly back on the trailer about a foot. I step on the trailer climb into boat and start it.  Go to the front and undo the loose bow strap.  If the bow strap gets tight, it won't come off, so that's the reason for only letting the boat slide off a foot, but leaving at least 2 feet loose on the strap.  I drive the boat off the trailer in reverse, park at dock, tie up, return to park the truck, return to boat and drive away.  Elapsed time is about 5 minutes."
724458,sneak_e_pete,2012-08-22 23:05:00,540,"I had to put teflon sliders on my bunks as where I launch, I couldnt get deep enough to float the boat off without submerging the back of the vehicle.  I personally unhook everything about a foot from the waters edge and then back up quickly, hit the brakes and the boat slides off nicely.  Gentle slops to ramp though."
724463,Handlebarz,2012-08-22 23:24:00,3790,Same as Roy I take winch off boat and hook my boat rope back in until it floats then pull trailer out until I can unhook rope tie off boat then pull trailer out never had a problem knock on wood
724472,aplumma,2012-08-23 00:25:00,6896,I used liquid roller on my bunk boards for a fiberglass boat. It will slide off the trailer at a very low angle and pushes off with little friction. I always leave the strap on till it is in the water. On my aluminum boat without the liquid roller I still strap it but it is not really needed.   Art
724474,LefroyFisherman,2012-08-23 00:37:00,602,"I always unhook everything and tie the rope that is on the bow to the back of the trailer and then launch and the boat comes too shore when I pull the trailer out.... I sure get some looks from people until they realize the boat is tied to the trailer, lol"
724478,spincast,2012-08-23 00:51:00,3279,"winch stays on till the motor (at least) is in the water - whether I launch solo or with help. I stop once the skeg is free and clear of any scrapes then undo. Back in. Float boat. tie off boat far enough away the next guy can launch. Pull away. Perhaps over cautious from so  many years of driving tractor trailer - but if you have ever had to crank a dropped trailer up in a parking lot after you already raised the gear - well lets just say once bitten twice shy...  True story from launch attendant last week  -- We were kinda watching some of the boaters who shall we say, aren't familiar with launch etiqutte or whose backing skills qualify them for Canada's worst trailer driver and having some good giggles  "" You wouldnt believe what happpened last long weekend."" She says "" Crazy line up, like 20 minutes at the worst point to launch. One of the guys drove the whole way here with nothing tied down. Backs up - boat falls off the trailer 15 foot from the water. Tow truck and major screw up time.  Boat, motor - toast. The guys lucky it happened here and not on the highway""   10 seconds extra to undo once in the water. No brainer."
