725038,tomkat,2012-08-25 18:55:00,246,I am going for 4 days of musky fishing mid Sept. and trying to decide between the two. I have never been to either and was wondering if anyone might have some input. I kind of like the idea of nosbonsing being a lot smaller but I have heard so much good stuff about the west arm. If anyone has been to both I would appreciate your opinion. Thanks
725098,Rich Nelson,2012-08-25 23:22:00,332,"Nosbonsing is a very tough lake for Musky... It was hit very hard in past years, and the population is down. there are still good skis in there, but getting them to bite is a different story. they have seen a lot of lures! Not saying West Arm is an easy fishery, but I think your chances are better there, and some giants!"

725123,Bernie,2012-08-26 01:29:00,3190,The south end of Nipissing holds some big ones as well. Your chances are better on Nipissing than Nosbonsing.

725315,tomkat,2012-08-27 00:45:00,246,Thanks for the input I guess we will try nipissing I have wanted to check it out for some time.
725325,chris.brock,2012-08-27 01:02:00,4053,"another vote for Nipp. The French is an option also, about the same drive, mid Sept is prime"
725375,Rich Clemens,2012-08-27 10:16:00,3131, I sure hope so.   I'll be there in a couple weeks.
725376,LefroyFisherman,2012-08-27 11:06:00,602,"The wife and I are also going to the French in a few weeks, camping and muskie on our 1 year anniversary!"
725393,Squid,2012-08-27 13:00:00,1656,Nosbonsing is a tough bite. There is also Trout lake. But my vote goes to Nipp
