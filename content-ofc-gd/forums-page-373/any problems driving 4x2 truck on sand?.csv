724805,ricoboxing,2012-08-24 17:03:00,398,We have a weekend food vending/catering business and tomorrow the event is gonna be at Woodbine beach in Toronto. I have a 4x2 Chevy Silverado and pull a 6x12 enclosed trailer (probably close to 2500lbs loaded).  Am I gonna have any problems driving my truck and trailer on the beach? Don't wanna get stuck in the middle of a crowded beach!!
724806,Raf,2012-08-24 17:05:00,3495,You'll likely get stuck
724807,davey buoy,2012-08-24 17:17:00,5505," You will,even without the trailer:("
724808,ehg,2012-08-24 17:19:00,2666,You would get stuck on beach just with empty 4x2. Forget about towing a 2500 lb food trailer. The sand is loose not packed.
724810,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-24 17:21:00,535,You'd have a hell of a time towing even with a 4x4 in loose sand. I wouldn't want to try it.
724811,ricoboxing,2012-08-24 17:21:00,398,"thanks for the replies, I'll tell them to have us setup on the boardwalk instead."
724813,bare foot wader,2012-08-24 17:23:00,1354,"not a smart idea...but if's hard packed like sauble you could get by, haven't been to toronto beaches in a long time now, can't remember  what size tires do you have? lower the psi to 15-20...I think you'd be ok if you didn't have the trailer, but you can rent a 4x for the weekend"
724819,Sinker,2012-08-24 17:31:00,8692,Don't do it.  That is all.  S.
724820,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-24 17:35:00,535,  Haha your name is perfect for this topic.
724855,Dara,2012-08-24 19:19:00,3052,go for it...whats the worst that can happen
