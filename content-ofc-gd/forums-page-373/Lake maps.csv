724655,hockeyplayerz_14,2012-08-24 00:25:00,160,Does anyone know a place I can get lake maps of in land lakes. The lake im looking for is head lake and it's not on navioncs so I would like a paper chart. Any suggestions?
724662,ctered,2012-08-24 00:38:00,40,You can find one in the Kawarthas Backroad Map book. Not sure where you are from to point you in the right direction. Any Sail or MEC store should have this book. If you are near St. Catharines then Peninsula Press on Bunting has the book and possibly individual lakes.  Check your pm.

Most of they have the local bait shops listed too.  A good last resort option.  How you doing Alex?  Getting geared up for Hockey season?"

I was told the lake is full of rocks too, so be vigilant.  There is also one in the Backroads Mapbook.  It was in the Kawartha edition which is discontinued, but they I believe they combined all the Kawartha lake maps into on of the other fishing mapbooks."
