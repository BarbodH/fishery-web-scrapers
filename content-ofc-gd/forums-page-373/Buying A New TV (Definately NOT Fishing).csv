724362,smally21,2012-08-22 15:52:00,993,"id make another comment but craig ritchie covered everything i would say. couldnt agree more half of TV knowledge is tribal/water cooler talk and has no basis in fact, or is old school.  i tried to swing a friend to the liquidator i buy most of my tvs from. he walked into future shop and bought a 3500 dollar tv for 2600 just by asking. big box and boutique stores have room to move. i buy and sell dozens of speakers and receivers each year, do some home install, etc. and i never buy from a retailer at all. but someone has to.  consider the liquidators they have equivalent if not better warranties than the big box and the extra savings protects you slightly from the HUGE drop in prices on electronics. remember everything you are looking at today is going to get cleared out at 50% within a year or so..  so a 1000$ tv on sale at 859$ is gonna be 549$ on boxing day, and they will sell the last unit as old stock for 499$ eventually."
724379,jedimaster,2012-08-22 17:43:00,3472,"I had had some panasonics, samsung, sony and the best, most crisp and clear tv's I have seen and own are sharp aquos. Yoy can record with a dvd bner but you may want to consider getting a blueray. Dvd's are on ther way out as far as watching goes."
724468,JoshS,2012-08-22 23:55:00,729,"Don't stress over it, just get a LED the size you want from a reputable brand, picture quality is all pretty good on tv's nowadays.. samsung's are a great choice. Plasma's aren't ideal for bright rooms, get an LED if it's upstairs in the house."
724476,smally21,2012-08-23 00:44:00,993,"99% of people couldnt tell you the difference between LCD and LED. Except maybe one is 200$ more.  by the numbers, plasma gives you the best ""numbers"" for the dollar. ie specifications you can use to pick one over the other."
724477,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-23 00:46:00,10439,  I think you mean LED and CFL. These are the type of back lighting used to illuminate the LCD TVs.
724486,GBW,2012-08-23 01:26:00,8460,I sure do!  One is left on by my wife and kids all day and night in my house and the other in NEVER on as it just's isn't a good value to me...
724490,Paudash,2012-08-23 01:43:00,273,the advantage of LED is they use less power so they put out off less heat.  If you put a standard LCD TV in a smaller room it will keep the room very warm.  For example I have a 47inch in a 10x10 and we can not close the door in the summer because of the heat.  Less power means they are cheaper to operate as these larger TVs are power eaters
724494,blarg,2012-08-23 01:55:00,289,"Plasma is still the superior technology, some people like the look of bright led's, that would be because they don't like to watch tv as it was meant to be watched, extremely bright over blown colors might look good in the store but plasmas will perform better and look more realistic at home.  Good plasmas do not suffer nearly as much as they used to from glare problems, thats more of a myth now, but you still wouldn't want to have it in direct sunlight, but then no tv would look good in that situation, the viewing room should be dark.  Plasma also provides uniform screen brightness and picture, most lcd tv's cfl or led back lit will not be as good, none really.  The st50 from panasonic is a good choice, i have the st30 from last year and its great, i recently needed a software update and within a few days of talking to panasonic they had sent someone over to do it. Also plasma burn in isn't an issue anymore on the better models, unless you really abuse it, and even then it will normally go away in time."
724520,smally21,2012-08-23 12:24:00,993,i meant LCD and LED. and it wasn't a question.
724551,RangerGuy,2012-08-23 14:43:00,564,"Other factors are how bright the room you will be putting the TV in.  I've heard Plasmas are better in like a basement and LCD, LED are better in a brighter room.  Personal preference I think.  Seriously look at Samsung, costco has some killer prices on thier upper end LCD tv.  My brother-in-law has a 46"" Sony (not sure of the model) but it's about the same level as my Samsung and my tv has a way better picture. People say it all the time that even the news looks better on ours.  I've had my samsung series 7 (i think thats what it is haha) for 2+ years with no issues at all."
724553,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-23 14:48:00,10439, LED is the back lighting method. It is actually an LCD screen with LED back lighting as opposed to CFL (compact flourescent lighting) back lighting. There are 2 different arrangements of LED back lighting and one arangement for CFL. LED backlighting comes in edge or matrix. Edge being where the perimeter of the screen is lit while matrix uses LEDs that are spread throughout the rear of the LCD screen. CFL is edge lit only.  With this information we can glean some information about picture quality as it pertains to LCD televisions. Edge lit screens are brighter towards the edge of the screen because of the design. The blacks are also not as black due to light bleed because of the way the screen is lit.  Matrix back lighting has the ability due to the distributed nature of the LEDs to have more even light and better blacks because the LEDs can be controlled more precisely in an area where the picture is supposed to be black (ie. they can beturned off so much less light bleed is evidenced.  Their are however true LED screens that the image is actually produced by LEDs. The giant screens you see at sports stadiums are built this way.  So now you know.
724559,craigdritchie,2012-08-23 15:17:00,1586,And I always thought CFL referred to football. Duh!
724570,smally21,2012-08-23 15:54:00,993,"CCFL. and again, wasnt a question."
724583,J.C.,2012-08-23 16:58:00,11," Same here.  You may want to consider that if you are using your TV to watch HDTV 1080p you are supposed to be alot closer to your tv than previously recommended. HD has alot more detail that you would not be able to see at a distance if the tv is not of adequate size. I would suggest for you to determine you viewing distance and then to go to the store to see for youself. Start at that distance and walk right up to the screen that interest you. If as you walk towards the screen you start to notice more detail, then the screen is not big enough for your viewing distance.  Personally I find aything more than 10' and I loose detail on a 50""  http://www.the-home-...l#axzz24O9uW96G"
724584,smally21,2012-08-23 17:04:00,993,There used to be a theory and a calculation on screen size vs viewing distance. The new theory is you buy the biggest tv your wallet will allow. If your credit card clears you havent bought a big enough tv
724585,J.C.,2012-08-23 17:11:00,11,Lol smally21. I think the tv in my house would get pretty big if it weren't for my other hobbies.   By the way the boat in your avatar is that yours? Stratos 375XF?

Once I thought I had the best deal n a 42"" LCD at best buy, I went to Costco and found it for 50 bucks cheaper. On top of the better price, Costco adds an additional one year warranty on top of first year manufacture warranty for no cost. Two years where id have to pay extra for that. Buy it from Costco."
723403,beaser,2012-08-18 03:16:00,19,"Todays TV's are all HD. 720P is all you need but i usually go for 1080P cuz I',m a gear slut and usually it's really not much more cost.. Blue ray can use 1080P as can PS3 but the HD converter from the cable or sat providers  only use up to 720P. The set top box outputs in 1080P but the source is still 720P at best. If you want to you can up convert old VCR tapes to 1080P. P stands for progressive scaN. They usually have interactive feature videos to show all of the bells and whistles.    HDMI inputs are very necessary and you really need about 3. Cable box, DVD ot blue ray and a spare. I use  A Western Difital media player for some of my photographic work.  You never know whats around the corner. Plasma are getting blow out the door right now and they aren't a bad set but they do run hotter and they do take a bit more power than LCD or LED. I belive LED runs cooler and mat be brighter. (a whiter back light)    I echo the chorus. You can't go wrong with samsung. I've had one for 5 years now. My sony is 10 years old but LCD rear projection and old technology. My daughter owns 2 samsungs and my son has one. There has been absolutely no problem.   Buy the middle range Samsung. Each model range varies from basic cheap to over abundance of bling. Usually there is a set right in the middle that does the job without being rediculous.  Find a site that does a full comparison of features. Look at the sets you are surveying side by side and be aware, the video they play on the sets is designed to make the set look good.  Sony and Sharp are premium sets but both have base models. Panasonic has always been reliable as well. When I buy another it will be Samsung.  Good Hunting"
723414,pikehunter,2012-08-18 08:57:00,1659,"Sorry Photoz I can't add anything constructive here but I can only say I'm still happy with my 2 of my TV's, a cheap which is now old, 27"" picture tube style from Wally world and an even older 28"" ? Sears version of a JVC that came with a 3 year warranty standard back then and not optional. I also have a flat screen 19"" RCA (lcd, plazma which I doubt, I don't know and don't care) bought a couple of years ago and hate it! Too damn complicated! I like the old TV's, simple, no hastles, turn 'em on watch some mindless tv shows and that's it.  I like the KISS theory...keep it simple s_ _ _ _ _. And I haven't found one TV show, a sports event or even a movie worthy enough for me to spend the big bucks on a new TV set. Plus Cogeco doesn't offer a decent signal that's worth a dime either. I just want reliability, that's all I ask for and from what has been said here none of the brands discussed have offered that.

723454,The JAY,2012-08-18 15:27:00,239,"Just finished reading this thread, and thought I'd throw my 2 cents in. I work for a BigBox, in the electronics department. I don't sell, I just hook up all of the electronics, and keep them runnin' 12 hours a day, 363 days a year.  [center]BRANDS[/center]  SONY - Avoid them. They're not what they used to be, but priced like they are. Sony has gotten out of manufacturing their own components. They buy parts from other makers, and that just increases costs.   LG - Good TVs, that have come a long way in the 10 years I've been watching them. If 3D is your thing, they offer the best bang for your buck. Passive glasses and upconverting of ANY 2D signals on most of their TVs. (x5600-x5800 models, if memory serves)  PANASONIC - More expensive than most, but their boards are delicate. They only TVs I've seen the connectors fall off of the boards were Panasonic. I've seen it more than once over the years.  SHARP - Again, good TVs, but priced slightly more expensive than other manufacturers for similar features.  SAMSUNG - Quality is among the very best, and their 3D is the most impressive. I'm legally blind in one eye, so I have almost no depth perception. The new x7000 and x8000 series, with the more expensive active glasses, showed me what 3D is. That being said, with the bells and whistles comes the price you gotta pay.  HAIER - New to North America, but they have been making TVs since 1997. Their selection isn't as varied as the other makers, and their prices are low as they are trying to gain market share in North Amrerica. They also have the lowest rate of return among the brands I've listed, and more than half of their returns are to increase screen size.  TOSHIBA - I actually own one, although it's 3 years old. Now, I would lump them in with SONY, and stay away.    [center]SOUND[/center]  All of these TVs, generally, come with 2 down firing speakers. 3-10 watts. For anything more than the most basic sound, you're going to want to add a home theater. Stay away from sound bars unless you're truly limited for space. Good sound can only come from moving air, and little speakers can't move as much as larger ones. Sound bars are generally VERY limited for connectivity. Make a list of how you are going to hook everything up before you go into the store, and let the salesperson know how you're going to do it.   As I said, this is just from my own observances, dealing with these TVs for the past 15 years. If you have any other questions, fire away."
723455,Raf,2012-08-18 15:31:00,3495,"I have an LG 55"" 3D and very happy.  There was no premium for the 3D when I bought so why not go with 3D?  There are two types of 3D; active and passive.  The former requires more expensive (proprietary??),  bulkier, heavier, battery operated glasses, the latter does not. LG uses passive, Samsung (I believe) active. In terms of programming it varies by provider, but there is not much out there as of yet.. I am on Shaw Direct satellite we get occasional free 3d programs and I believe a PPV 3D channel.  For the most part you are limited to 3D Blu-Rays of which there is a rapidly growing amount.  LG, Samsung and Panasonic are the 3 brands too look at IMO --  LG are likely the cheapest good quality TVs, Samsung builds a good product priced a little higher and Panasonic are great if you have the $$$ and couch potato enough to warrant a higher end TV like that.  LG IMO, are the best bang for the buck for the casual viewer.  If you are concerned with such matters, LED TVs will hurt least on your monthly Hydro bill, Plasma most.  The power consumption difference is not insignificant."
723576,Randy,2012-08-19 12:02:00,115,"I have a 5 years old Sony XBR and it now has periodic flashes and negative white screen problems. Checking on the internet, many other people have similar or worse problems for this vintage XBR. It apparently is a soldering problem on one of the circuit boards. Since it is no longer under warranty, I'm outta luck unless I want to pay hundreds of dollars to fix it. I'm waiting for it to finally pack it in and then get something other than Sony.

723814,Paudash,2012-08-20 02:20:00,273,"things to remember when buying today's TV's  1)They do not last like the old ones they are now disposable and next week it will be cheaper (for the price they used to be they had to last 20 years)  2)what ever your budget is spend 40% of it on a sound system.  TV is way better when you can hear it and feel it. A good sound system will make a bad TV way better than a good TV with a bad sound system  3)LCD for upstairs Plasma for the basement  4)Plasma for 50 inch or bigger  5)do not buy it from a place that shows 50 TV's side by side because they play with the colour to make some look worse to up sell you  6)best deal is Costco by far because of the warranty 2 years vs 1 year and ask anyone that has had a issue with a TV and it is almost always within the first 18 months.  Also 90 day price guarantee (went back 3 on my last TV and they gave me a credit back every time with no issue)  7)do not get suckered into expensive cables, you only need a thin layer of gold not a thick layer like monster cables or the other cables they try to up sell you on.  The reason you put more gold on a connector is for repeated plugging and unplugging. How many times do you take the cables off once you are set up?

723861,craigdritchie,2012-08-20 13:29:00,1586,"To debunk a couple of myths .....  1. Plasma looks great in a dark room, but does not absolutely require it. Panasonic had a bunch of plasma displays in various airports over the past winter, where they were often fully exposed to bright sun (sometimes glaring off snow), and yet they all looked terrific. You do not need to confine a plasma screen to a cave to have it look good.  2. None of the manufacturers make all of the inside components themselves. Virtually every TV out there contains a number of major parts and components made by other (competing) brands. It is simply more cost-efficient for LG to buy tuners or circuit boards from Sony than to make their own - just as it is cheaper for Sony to buy LCD panels from Sharp than start their own manufacturing line. It has been this way for at least 10 - 15 years (just like computers), yet many people still believe all the parts in their TV were made by the same company. The end result is, there isn't as much difference between brands as some manufacturers (or salespeople) would have you believe.  3. Understand that each store will fiddle with the set-up on the display models so that the brands they make the highest profits on will always look best. They all do this - particularly the big box chains.  4. TVs have become disposable. None of them are made to last, so don't get sucked in to paying a ton of money for something that you will likely have to replace within 10 - 12 years.  5. Count me X3 on the sound system. Makes all the difference in the world!  Consumer Reports does a lot of TV comparisons each year. If in doubt, subscribe and get their reports. That's the best, and only truly unbiased, information out there.  Enjoy your new TV."
723873,The JAY,2012-08-20 14:33:00,239,"  I agree with everything here, except #3. I can't speak for other stores/chains, but not only do I NEVER adjust the settings when setting up floor model displays, but after talking with regional managers, etc. it has become part of our merchandising directive not to do so.  Again, I'm not speaking for everyone, but not EVERYONe does this.   I also can't emphasize enough the importance of spending some cash on the sound, especially if you're a big movie fan, or listen to a lot of music."

That being said, from my understanding the newer models use a much better non-reflecting glass.  So, it's more than likely you saw those ones in the airport.   Just something to keep in mind.  Also, not sure if this was mentioned or still even holds true, but Samsung uses panels from three different manufacturers.  Some claim one is better than the other.

723308,davey buoy,2012-08-17 21:14:00,5505,"Personally I would be looking at a HD tv for sure,a couple or three of usb ports,a lot of the newer tv's have internet ready.( To be used as a monitor,need be,also a bonus).That is good for let's say net flicks,if you should choose, IMO after owning plasma and lcd,my favourite is lcd,but haven't tried led. 3D is not quite there"" yet"",it is but not a lot of programs. IMO and maybe never from what I've read and heard. The highest available processor is also a advantage to quicker and sharper images. Although they cost a bit more,well worth the money. Good luck on your entertainment hunting!!!"
723315,wallyboss,2012-08-17 21:39:00,1095,"I would bother with 3D yet, it's still a long way until there will be enough 3D programming available for it.  Definetly go HD ( actually it is pretty hard to find one that isn't HD) I used to be a Sony guy also. But now I am all Samsung or LG. Sony have nice Bravia, but they are more expensive for the same specs than LG or Samsung. I have a 52"" Samsung HD for 3 years now and it is probably on 18 hours a day. And it's still as clear as Day 1.  Plasma is okay if you are putting it in a dark basement away from any sun glare, if not LCD is the way to go. Refresh rate of at least 120hz or more. My 52"" is 60hz and I can see a bit of movement in the background. I have a 50"" with refresh of 120 and it is crystal clear.  You are looking at about $1,300.00 for a very good 52"" with all the bells and whistle that you'll need. The Sony Bravia would be a tad more than that.  Go with Samsung,LG or Sony, they are all well built with top notch technology. Stay away from Citizen, RCa and other bugger companies."
723316,GBW,2012-08-17 21:48:00,8460,"Same here. Samsung is the worlds biggest MFG of glass for LCD's and keep the best for themselves and sell the rest to the others like SONY, Dell, HP and many others.  LG is next in line, sorry Joey.  Samsung even makes Apple products. I worked for Samsung for 2 years and needless to say ALL my stuff (tv, fridge, stove and more) is Samsung.  I did get a heck of a deal on it too so why not buy some of the best stuff out there.  Now, it's been many years sice I worked there and everything is going as strong today as the day I got it. You will need a HD box from bell/rogers and a HDMI cable (audio & video in 1) or 2 or 3.  Make sure your suroundsound amp can take HDMI and you should be good to go.  I had to go get a new amp but it wasn't much at all.  Good luck. Geoff"
723320,kickingfrog,2012-08-17 21:59:00,8333,"Costco did (double check current policy) double manufacture's 1 warranty  to two years automatically. Given the current limited longevity of these products it might be of value.  You don't have to get a HD box (either bought or supplied by your cable company) but I really like it for sports and nature/travel shows. At this point, imo, unless you are really into 3D video games and/or 3D movies I would not bother with 3D tv."
723326,davey buoy,2012-08-17 22:14:00,5505,Can't go wrong with either LG or Samsung!!!!
723330,kickingfrog,2012-08-17 22:29:00,8333,My 2008 LG lasted 18 months.
723335,davey buoy,2012-08-17 22:38:00,5505," Must of had a bad one?,the reviews are good.My oldest plasma is 10 years old,and about $2500.oo at the time for a 42"".Can you believe how much prices have dropped?Wow.!!"
723338,GBW,2012-08-17 22:58:00,8460,Not shocked.  My dad's LG range is less than a year old and they wanted $250 from him for a warranty call at his home for a $3.78 part.  He had to pay for the 'warranty' call but they were very kind and covered the $3.xx part...
723340,Broker,2012-08-17 23:01:00,482,"I love my sony Bravia works great! havnt seen any posts about sony yet  I thought it was a popular TV, maybe not lol"
723341,GBW,2012-08-17 23:02:00,8460,"because they are a far, FAR cry from what they once were..."
723343,Broker,2012-08-17 23:08:00,482," Hmm, had an old sony that lasted 18 years, then 2 years ago bought this one.. hopefully it lasts half of what the last one did.. lol"
723345,kickingfrog,2012-08-17 23:11:00,8333, Unfortunately there is not a chance that will happen.
723347,gaspumper,2012-08-17 23:15:00,393,Take a look at the LG LED's vibrant color and clarity.
723348,davey buoy,2012-08-17 23:18:00,5505,"My parents had a 26"" sylvania floor model. It was 20 plus years old when they gave it to someone else. They don't make them like that anymore. Tubes!!!"
723353,bow slayer,2012-08-17 23:50:00,1074,"samsung and Panasonic are the only 2 i would be looking at. Check online reviews and consumer reports they all have Samsung and Panasonic 1,2. Just talk to guys at some of the smaller retail places,not future shop or best buy. Samsung makes LCD and Plasma screens for almost everyone else including sony. And yes save your money and stay away from 3D.....for now anyways. check out the link   http://reviews.cnet.com/best-high-definition-tvs/"
723357,Christopheraaron,2012-08-18 00:17:00,3525,"""definitely NOT fishing""  You could watch WFN."
723362,smally21,2012-08-18 00:37:00,993,"i have 3 samsungs all have been reliable. the latest Un8000 series samsung in 64"" is quite the tv. 3d has been out for years lots of tvs and almost all av receivers are ready for it there is really no premium on the technology now.  lack of programming isnt a huge problem like surround processors modern units matrix 3d images its not quite as good as a dedicated 3d recording.  personally i have no interest in 3d but all my av gear accepts it.."
723363,Photoz,2012-08-18 00:39:00,792,"Hey . . . ..   thanks for all the input, guys . . .  one more question, do these fancy LCD & plazma TV's record just 'normal' HD DVD's? I do have a Sony DVD player / recorder . . .   not HD though? (Maybe e e e e  my ol' XBR will hang in another few years?)"
723368,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-18 01:08:00,10439,"I'm a big sports guy and because of that own a Panasonic Plasma. When purchasing my set a couple of years ago I found that even the most expensive LCD units suffered from motion blur when watching fast moving sports like hockey and racing. If you're not a sports guy go for an LCD as they use less power and are lighter in weight. Also go big!!!! My living room is 15'X15' and I have a 50"". It's a good size for the room, but the first day I had it I thought that I went too big. It only took a day for me to realize that I didn't.  Although I now think a 60"" would be nice."
723369,Fang,2012-08-18 01:24:00,1330,Just finished 9 months of research and looking at many different models plasma and LCD. I bought a plasma Panasonic Viera GT THX. It's a higher end but I'll share what I learned. On a good plasma you can place it it any room regardless of light. Again a better plasma has a very wide viewing angle. My choice came down to the Samsung Smart TV (LCD) and the Panasonic plasma GT. it was a dead heat except I found the colour on the Panasonic just richer and the Samsung was a little too bright and contrasty. It all comes down to colour and sharpness so watch that settings on the tv are not set to high so it looks better under the store lights I have 2 Vieras now and both are great
723385,GBW,2012-08-18 02:10:00,8460,"The TV doesn't do anything other  than show you the pic. What ever you use to recorder will be broadcast in the same manner.  Don't stress about it, just to get a nice new TV"
723395,Dabluz,2012-08-18 02:55:00,701,I also hate the blur when looking at a LED screen.  I bought a Panasonic with plasma screen and love it.  Do not believe all the hype about having a dark room to see the screen.  You can use any dvd player with the new televisions but the H.D. dvd players are not expensive anyway so why not be able to see your movies in high definition.  I also bought a Samsung home theater system.....the sound is awesome.
