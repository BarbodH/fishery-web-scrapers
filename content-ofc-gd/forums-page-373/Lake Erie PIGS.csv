714049,Toad Hunter,2012-07-12 18:48:00,261,"Nm, just realized this is an old thread lol, guess there were still some left as of last weekend"
714061,mercman,2012-07-12 19:35:00,7054,Billy will leave some for the rest of us.he's good like that:clapping:
714107,grimsbylander,2012-07-12 21:46:00,3016,I'm about a 30 minute drive from Fort Erie. Are you thinking about a park or something? I don't know anyone with a big back yard we could invade. I'll check it out.  ?
714122,Billy Bob,2012-07-12 23:04:00,5865," Grim.....that's EXACTLY what we are looking for......it will be just a one day get together near the end of April with a park of some kind to gather and cook up our catch of the day.....late April is a great time for Lake Erie Perch......we probably could all launch out of Crystal Beach....fish until noon or 1pm and then meet somewhere close for a HUGE Perch Fish Fry.....nothing fancy......but a great way to meet, greet and EAT.....  Bob"
714125,dave524,2012-07-12 23:15:00,4508,"there is a good sized city park at the launch area of Port Colborne, lots of parking maybe something could be worked out at that location."
714198,Moosebunk,2012-07-13 02:54:00,3970,OMG!!!  I never saw this spring carnage before.  Ressurect the PIGS... Lord of the Flies guys!!!
714231,grimsbylander,2012-07-13 11:08:00,3016,"Actually, there is a large park right at the crystal beach launch. Last Sunday there was a picnic going on there with about 100 people. I'll look closer next time and see if its a good fit."
714380,Billy Bob,2012-07-13 20:23:00,5865, This sounds PERFECT to get together after fishing and have a huge fish fry....
714381,Billy Bob,2012-07-13 20:24:00,5865, THANK YOU.....if the Crystal Beach park don't work this could.....
714382,Billy Bob,2012-07-13 20:26:00,5865, Wait until later or tomorrow.........I have a nice Lake Ontario Salmon report to put together......one word describes it best......KILLED...
714384,blaque,2012-07-13 20:33:00,2419, Thats good to hear.....Ill be going out of Wilson next weekend
714471,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 12:45:00,5865, Blaque.........we went out of Rochester.....the Genesee River to be exact....straight out and started trolling at 80 feet and never had to go to more then 120 feet of water...
714615,shimano19,2012-07-15 01:25:00,196,woah those are some monster perch!!!
724643,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 00:05:00,5865,grimsbylander and OR dave524..... Are you guys still on board with this SPRING FISHING FLING.......I think this could grow each year......
724653,skeeter,2012-08-24 00:21:00,1907,I'm good with this G2G!!  :thumbsup_anim: Count me in Billy Bob.
724660,mercman,2012-08-24 00:34:00,7054,I was just thinking.I havent caught a perch in months. Havent targeted them specifically. but i always get a bunch fishing other species. I'd love to get into some of those beauts.
724677,J.C.,2012-08-24 01:22:00,11,"Wow you really hit the mother load! Truly impressive.  I showed these pics to my 6 year old. She looked at me and said Wow, is the boat ready to go out fishing.  Thanks for sharing those awesome pics."
724690,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 01:55:00,5865, OLD pictures from April........but I'm hoping we can do a G2G next April and have a big fish fry afterwards....
724722,skeeter,2012-08-24 10:08:00,1907,"I just checked the pictures again, and they look as fresh as the day you caught them."
724727,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 10:52:00,5865,"And they are still tasting as fresh as the day I caught them...  When I get back from Vegas the perch bite should be on again........but the freezer is still bulging at it's sides with crappie, perch, walleye and now lots of salmon....maybe I'll have to practice catch and release perch fishing......NOT........"
724767,xKobeZx,2012-08-24 14:03:00,10,wow
724795,GreenCanada,2012-08-24 16:16:00,375,Holy perch! Good on ya for having the patience to fillet them all!
724797,captpierre,2012-08-24 16:25:00,2521,wow.  They look they're full of eggs but that can't be the case this time of year.  Are their stomachs full of minnows crayfish or gobies?  peter
724868,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 20:12:00,5865," Hello Capt Pete,  Those were caught back in April......so all eggs....yum perch caviar..."
688916,skeeter,2012-04-21 02:33:00,1907,You boil them in soap and water??
688970,oldphart,2012-04-21 11:51:00,665,"~~~Dang~~~Did anyone get an invite for supper, i sure didn't get an invite, and he only done up 9 fillets, does he think were just going to enjoy just looken at them, lets gather into a hungry mob, and storm his place.  PS: I'll need a ride"
688997,Grimace,2012-04-21 14:26:00,2020,"Is that lard?  Great for the taste, bad for the heart."
689010,Billy Bob,2012-04-21 15:57:00,5865, TUNDRA my Guard Dog was put on duty while we enjoyed Lake Erie's Finest...
689012,Billy Bob,2012-04-21 16:02:00,5865, Oh do I remember the days of using lard...  ...my beloved mother in-law would boil down her own lard for french fries and fish fries.....but that in the fry pan was heart health Canola Oil.....I buy it by the gallon at Sam's Club...  Now if we could get a Fort Erie local to set up a place to meet and greet we could all get in on the action on Lake Erie and have a feast....
689014,manitoubass2,2012-04-21 16:09:00,11391,Those pigs would eat the perch we get up here.  I'm jealous
689140,brw,2012-04-22 01:34:00,101, I have never seen a bigger collection of hog perch in my life!!! I bow dowm before thee....I am not worthy!!!
689199,Billy Bob,2012-04-22 09:59:00,5865, I get them like that every time out....only this time I had a camera....LOL....and I have a Peace Bridge for sale...CHEAP...  It just proves even a blind Redneck finds a perch now and then...
689432,skeeter,2012-04-23 01:00:00,1907,How much for the peace bridge?
689499,Billy Bob,2012-04-23 13:12:00,5865,"Skeeter, would you be using CN funds or US funds....  Maybe we could work out a deal so the tax man can't touch us....like maybe some nightcrawlers and Emerald Shiners...."
689723,skeeter,2012-04-24 02:09:00,1907,"I live in scarboro, there's lots of night crawlers around here.  :ninja:"
689754,pikehunter,2012-04-24 09:00:00,1659, That would be a concern if fishing inland lakes. Like to see someone tell that to the cptn on an Erie trawler. They scoop up all without any thoughts and the guy catching a few gets smacked for not catching and releasing a few females. Fishermen/ladies barely make a dent on Erie's populations.
689756,krixxer,2012-04-24 10:41:00,274,"I think I'll print out your pictures and clip them to the underside of the boat as perch porn. Sexy girls like that will surly it will bring in the big boys,"
689757,rufftuffcuff,2012-04-24 10:47:00,4,Those are HUGE perch! And lots of them too!
689758,Skipper D,2012-04-24 10:51:00,1970,"Which ""perch chip"" are you useing Billy Bob to find thease ......"
689815,jimmer,2012-04-24 14:32:00,2730,That is just not fair BB.
690045,Pikeslayer,2012-04-25 13:17:00,1443,Any update on this proposed LE G2G?? You may want to call it;   BAY OF PIGS 2012  
690090,Billy Bob,2012-04-25 16:17:00,5865,"Pike Slayer.......I like that name and will continue to work on this....but again, we need a local Canadian on the north east shoreline of Lake Erie (where you are only limited by your bait bucket) to help make this happen."
694438,mercman,2012-05-09 01:48:00,7054,Its amazing what you can find when you use PIGS as a search word. I had to take another peek at these porkers
694446,Skipper D,2012-05-09 02:00:00,1970,Mark the spot with a red flag Billy Bob and wi'll just meet you there when you say .........
694659,Billy Bob,2012-05-09 20:33:00,5865," If the weather holds, I will be on that spot again come Friday."
694685,ohhenrygsr,2012-05-09 22:52:00,947,Are those Walleye?
695029,Billy Bob,2012-05-10 21:40:00,5865, They are the cousin of the walleye....LOL  STILL LOOKING for a Canadian near Fort Erie to help out on a G2G for Lake Erie Perch.......we could have a HUGE fish fry afterwards.....
714039,Billy Bob,2012-07-12 18:28:00,5865,"I have recently had some more interest in setting up ""THE BAY OF PIGS"" for April of 2013....but still looking for one or two local guys in the Crystal Beach, Fort Erie area to find a spot to set up a get together site after we fish just one day and have a huge perch fry........anyone....anyone....anyone....anyone.....LOL  How about you grimsbylander...your not too far if I'm correct....and maybe would get fish together or at least follow each other out.......or any other volunteers ? ? ?  Bob"
714047,Toad Hunter,2012-07-12 18:37:00,261,"Those are some real pig toads u got yourself there  man, I can't wait to get back there, the bite is non stop and don't think I landed any under 10""s out of the at least 75 landed in the 3.5 hrs I was there - hope u left us some"
688686,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 13:34:00,5865, We would need someone local around Fort Erie to the Port Colborne area that has contacts to use a park or fire hall to do the fish fry....everyone could just start fishing at daylight of the day planned and be back to the meeting area with fish and fillet knives by 2pm......shouldn't take more then a hour to fillet and clean up....then a huge fish fry.....there use to be (35 years ago) a lot of cottages in the Crystal Beach area for rent for those who want to stay over 1 night....
688692,misfish,2012-04-20 13:56:00,29133,Can I fish with you BB.
688696,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 14:02:00,5865, SURE...but right now I have 2 other guys that want that spot....I'll put you on the LIST...
688700,Headhunter,2012-04-20 14:11:00,5703,Those are some trojan Perch BB! Way to go! What time is the dinner bell? HH
688702,misfish,2012-04-20 14:26:00,29133,"  No worries,as I like golbies and rice noodle soup."
688703,BillM,2012-04-20 14:32:00,17367,"Wow BB, those are some cows!  I gotta get the oldman out on Simcoe for a little bit of perchin' soon!"
688710,jimmer,2012-04-20 14:52:00,2730,Those have to be the largest perch I have ever seen! Nice haul BB. Have you ever eaten the egss out of those things???? Just wondering what they are like. There should be a whack of boats out there this weekend after everyone sees those pics! Wish I lived closer.
688712,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-04-20 15:01:00,535,Wow! That is incredible!

688728,adempsey,2012-04-20 16:00:00,1498,"Nice, some of the biggest perch I've seen.  Must have been a hell of a day!"
688735,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 16:58:00,5865, NO...I personally have never eaten the roe from perch...when I went to fishing school years ago our teacher cooked some up for us but I just ate the fish....most of the guys were on them like stink on a monkey...  But who knows....I now eat sushi and caviar while in Vegas...get few Lancaster Ice Teas in me and I'll try almost anything....
688737,Jds63,2012-04-20 17:03:00,1365,"wow , those are jumbos for sure, very nice"
688747,woodenboater,2012-04-20 17:45:00,2277,"If you keep the roe in the sac, try steaming them and put a little grated fresh ginger and some soy on it. I actually try to pick fish (bass for example) that are stuffed with eggs when shopping in Chinese supermarkets. The people working the counter usually know to ask if you want to keep the eggs as they're cleaning them.  Curious since it's been years since I've had perch from Erie ( Port Dover) but how deep do they trawl their nets when catching perch ? I had a chance to go out on an Erie fishing boat once but missed the opportunity."
688762,OhioFisherman,2012-04-20 19:00:00,6623,Dang! Muskie bait! They even have a Perch finish!
688770,fishnsled,2012-04-20 19:14:00,3520,That's some good fishing!
688787,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-20 20:50:00,310,"Wow, some of the biggest perch I have ever seen."
688802,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 21:49:00,5865, Correct me if I'm wrong.....but they don't trawl for perch....but rather set those nasty gill nets for perch....
688824,woodenboater,2012-04-20 22:40:00,2277,"sorry BB, meant that or however they bring 'em in. I like Port Dover in the summer, nice place to day trip."
688828,lovetofish,2012-04-20 22:46:00,500,Wow!  Gotta love them JUMBOS!!!  LTF
688851,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 23:42:00,5865,And now the final product......    BURP....

688524,Fish Farmer,2012-04-19 23:59:00,2234,"Billy, did you say Pigs? sounds like a good Farm Report to me.   Way to go bud, nice catch. My buddy and myself luck out with the pigs on our side the other day. We caught lots of mamas to, but like you said they blow their guts out when you bring them up from 65 FTW. I've had two Perch fries this week and even had Perch and eggs for breakfast."
688527,Wolf 3,2012-04-20 00:02:00,134,Monster perch!  Good job guys.

688560,skeeter,2012-04-20 01:16:00,1907,"SWEET !!!!!!!!!!!  Those are really nice looking fish.  Between the 2 of you, you are allowed 50 perch EACH. Instead of catching your limit, you limited your catch, so I tip my hat to the both of you. Kudo's-------  :thumbsup_anim:"
688561,Moosebunk,2012-04-20 01:16:00,3970,OMG those perch are awesome!  Some of the fattest I think I've ever seen off anywhere!  Nice haul BBob&Co.

688589,Skud,2012-04-20 02:38:00,739,Those perch are pigs alright. That is how I look(or at least feel) when I have dinner at my Mother in law's. Italian food is so good.

688621,mike rousseau,2012-04-20 06:20:00,4661,Sweet catch...  And don't worry about keeping them... If you kept 50 jumbos in the summer that's ok in most peoples eyes... Even tho those are the same fish that turn into slobs with eggs in em the spring...
688636,fishindevil,2012-04-20 10:41:00,6254,awesome catch !!! those are the biggest perch i have ever seen !!!  they are massive !!! wow...
688656,corvette1,2012-04-20 12:17:00,1765,congrats on the tanks bob. on the keeping side go on youtube and see what the netters take you take them or they take them they took less then one limit.
688660,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 12:31:00,5865," When I get a ""Way to go bud, nice catch"" from the FARMER I know I did good...  Perch fry you say....yes sir, the bride and I plan on one tonight...it's going to be 76 degrees here today....  ...so it will be a perch fry with lots of Lancaster Ice Teas (you listening Cliff) and a camp fire on the back deck....it don't get no better then that...  OH, BTW....you guys all know I'm the most frugal of the bunch here....so I did purchase Cabela's ""Rip Cord"" late last fall for my perch rig rod...I was going to get Power Pro but it was twice as much....but anyway's I got the Cabela's line in 15# test and they advertise it to be 4# Diameter  but it's really 6# Diameter   and it works FANTASTIC fishing in that deep water for perch...I wouldn't cast with it but this rod is only used for deep water perch fishing on Lake ????....LOL  Now here's a idea.....a G2G for Lake Erie Perch get together and a huge fish fry afterwards......and those who don't like keeping the big boys (really girls) can eat gobies......anyone in the Niagara area have any contacts like a fire hall that we could gather for fish fry ? ? ?"
688661,Grimace,2012-04-20 12:34:00,2020,Those are monsters.  Way to go.  My dad and his neighbour did very well the other night on the north side.  Great catch
688663,Pikeslayer,2012-04-20 12:40:00,1443, Well..........looks like I better get my passport renewed and a NYS fishing licence too.  What's the limit on gobies???????????

688458,Billy Bob,2012-04-19 22:10:00,5865,"My old buddy Don wanted to hit Lake Erie for some big perch.....he called me last night to change the game plan....my spot he heard was producing ZERO but his buddy Rick was getting some nice fish off the Wind Mills on the east shoreline......OK...we'll do that......dipped my own bait yesterday on the Niagara River trying to get the big Lake Erie minnows....zillions of them down there....one dip was enough to fill a bait shop, not my bait bucket....took only 1/4 of the dip home and still was concerned there were too many in my special 7 gallon bait bucket......  Well today we towed my old rig down to Small Boat Harbor in Buffalo....but when we were driving over the Sky Way we could see the white caps already forming well before 8am.....got down to the launch and the wind we up and we could feel it blowing right into the inner harbor....we decided to tow my boat to the Catt and hopefully the winds would stay south as they were when we left Small Boat Harbor......along Hamburg Beach with the south wind the shoreline was nice and calm...  When we finally reached the Catt (about 45 miles west of Buffalo) the winds had already started to turn to the SW......but not too bad, YET....  When I hit my hot spot per my GPS we had a hard time getting the anchor to take hold....we finally tied my small 10lb mushroom anchor just above my 3 feet of chain to add more weight...it worked....and this time we were only 52 feet off my hot spot when the anchor took hold.....and boy did all this Bull pay off in PIGS....I'll let the pictures tell the rest of the story....BTW we got blown off around 1pm...but we did manage 47 nice perch, which 35 were just friggin HUGE...you be the judge.   This is the tall boy 7 gallon bucket filled with only 47 perch    And finally filleted up. "

688475,Pikeslayer,2012-04-19 22:33:00,1443,Well done BB Can you save a few for treats for my cats? I'll trade you some venison tenderloin for Tundra ?
688477,limeyangler,2012-04-19 22:33:00,5204,"Those perch are huge!!!!  Awesome fishin' BB, i have to say that is the most impressive haul i have ever seen.....ever.   "
688479,Billy Bob,2012-04-19 22:35:00,5865, There you go again Mr Pike Slayer Sir.....no fish for you....come back one year.
688480,Christopheraaron,2012-04-19 22:36:00,3525,"Great fishin, would be nice to let some of those females go though..."
688481,Billy Bob,2012-04-19 22:36:00,5865, Thank You....I appreciate the compliment.
688482,bushart,2012-04-19 22:36:00,2628,Holy Smokes---Dem are the biggest perchkins I ever did see
688484,Billy Bob,2012-04-19 22:38:00,5865," Almost all were females....fishing in 60 feet of water, they don't survive MOST times...they then become sea gull food."

688504,Pikeslayer,2012-04-19 23:04:00,1443,"  Brian, Here's a quick excerpt from an article I found on line:  Walleye and perch have a reduced chance of survival if they are caught in water deeper than seven metres, brought to the surface, and then released. When walleye or perch are caught in deep water, their swim bladders can’t adapt quickly enough to the change in atmospheric pressure. This causes the fish equivalent of ‘the bends’. The internal damage that results will likely kill the fish.  Simon"
688507,misfish,2012-04-19 23:13:00,29133,"  I thank you for your reply Simon.  If you take from deep divers theroy,they tell you,if you come up slow,you dont get the bends. Truely when fishing for said fish,and you know what you are catching,slow retreive,will prevent the bends. Just saying. We brought many up  from 80 on Simcoe,and never seen a bladder.Why,cause we knew they were perch."
688510,Billy Bob,2012-04-19 23:21:00,5865, I guess these perch should of read your avatar then....  You do realize we are talking about Lake Erie here that has a fleet of commercial fishing boats that are out there taking these perch by the THOUSANDS....I called it a day with under 50 fish for the two us.  You can always count on a couple guys here to beat down a fishing report...seen it SOOOO MANY times now that many now don't even bother doing a fishing report.....  But anyway's......I glad I had a good day to share with those who enjoyed looking....and I have had several PM's for more info which I am always willing to share.  Bob
688513,Pikeslayer,2012-04-19 23:32:00,1443," And now I know something new. Thx For sharing Brian. I've learned on Quinte that you try to avoid the deeper 'eyes when trolling cause it's tough to control the rate of ascent, but never thought that way about perch. I guess that's why I like pike. LOL."
688516,misfish,2012-04-19 23:38:00,29133," Guess I,m looking at my new way of fishing BB. C&R. Many more for those, for  the days to come and enjoy, when you and I are gone. It,s not a beat down.just take it as one that has seen over harvest, and has seen what a no kill can do. I do believe we are allowed our opinions here still. Right or wrong.  Like I said,,,,,,,,,,to each their own,I believe we discussed it."
688523,Fang,2012-04-19 23:58:00,1330,I just checked on line and there's only a 20 minute wait to cross the border at the Peace bridge.
