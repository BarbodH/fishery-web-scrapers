So headed out with friends on lake Ontario yesterday looking to hit some bows and salmon. Put in a good 7 hr shift boating four fish but they were beauties. One bow and 3 kings, by far the biggest fish I've landed or even seen (other than on this site)!!! Pretty excited myself so I thought I'd share.  Have pics but don't know how to Post them. I'm operating on an I phone and want to show pics! Any ideas?? Bill"
