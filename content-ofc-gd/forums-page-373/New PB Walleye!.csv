724992,limeyangler,2012-08-25 14:39:00,5204, Thanks Dan....it came out pretty neat eh! I just saw the blue tinge on the fin and wanted a pic...the auto setting picked up way more detail than i had hoped.    Thanks Shawn!...a few more inches for Team 5!    Thanks man!
724993,NAW,2012-08-25 14:41:00,4022,Congrets on the the PB Simon.  What a beast eh  Nice clean looking fish too.
724997,mike rousseau,2012-08-25 15:10:00,4661,Great haul Simon...  Musts been some kinda moon cycle... Cause I managed 16 walleye in 4 hours on Thursday as well... They were practically jumpin in the boat....  No piggies like your big one tho... A few over 24...  Lost one around 27-28 inches yesterday tho... And landed 8 in 3 hours... So again... Kinda like you... Lots thursday... Half that friday...  Neat...
725006,Leecher,2012-08-25 15:55:00,7832,You hit the mother load this time around Simon  and caught on light tackle    Congrats on your PB
725009,Rod Caster,2012-08-25 16:07:00,5784,"I did well last night too, but nothing close to 32""!! What a catch."
725218,limeyangler,2012-08-26 15:15:00,5204," Thanks man....next stop 33""!   That's awesome Mike.....yup...there was something in the air that night!    Thanks Jacques...yup...have to get a drag setting i'm happy with.....but the big ones had me resetting my drag constantly.     Thanks Chad, we went back the other day and it was quite the different story......for me at least.....the two lads i took out got a nice one each...i only managed 2 dinky ones...here are some pics from Friday evening.    WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES.....24 LITTLE HOURS!                                   "

724777,limeyangler,2012-08-24 14:45:00,5204,"Hi all, Got my new PB walleye yesterday. I finished nightshift and headed out to my favourite in town spot.  Started out with a few small lakers for tomorrow’s lunch then headed off to seek some monster walleye..... they came out to play!  I had to move once as some bozo thought it was ok to slowly make his way over within 30 feet of my bow when we were the only 2 boats on the lake (I don’t get that at all   ) , but the magic number seemed to be 30'FOW and I soon found another spot and had a fish on again.  All fish came on a jig and minnow, trout in 70'FOW suspended at 40'FOW, walleyes on the flats near to the deeper water at 30'FOW.  Got about 10 walleye in all, not one under 24"" with one at 30'+ inches and my new PB by .25"" at a not too shabby 32.5""!  Great 4 hours on the water!       VIDEO OF THE AFTERNOON'S ACTION  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/aNFNK5DUP7A"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                                       Getting 10lb+ walleye on very light tackle with nothing more than a 3/8 Oz jig is addictive, might just have to sneak back there this afternoon.   Tight lines all."
724778,Spiel,2012-08-24 14:49:00,9065,"That's a beast Simon, many congrats!"
724780,Luke V.,2012-08-24 14:50:00,286,HECK YES!!!  Id be back there every morning and evening!!!  Way to go on the PB
724781,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 14:50:00,5865,Limer.......VERY nice fish.......on the flats you say....they could be moving to those fall transition areas where mud meets rock and none or not much change in depth...this has been a good pattern for me for years on inland lakes in the fall....but it's still a hot summer pattern down here.
724786,lifeisfun,2012-08-24 15:13:00,99,Awesome!
724788,ccmtcanada,2012-08-24 15:29:00,7971,Absolute MONSTER!!! Way to go and congrats!!!!
724789,adempsey,2012-08-24 15:31:00,1498,Nice!  They look like they grow up fast in that lake.  Good looking fish.
724796,manitoubass2,2012-08-24 16:22:00,11391,"man o man!  Beauty fish! Gonna be tough to beat that PB, so yeah, get out there again today and start trying!  "
724801,TDunn,2012-08-24 16:56:00,680,Wow.... Now thats some great fishing! Huge eyes man!!    TDunn
724829,Jds63,2012-08-24 18:14:00,1365,"Awesome Simon, always love watching your videos ... always wondered how you have your camera mounted to the fishing rod ?"
724836,manitoubass2,2012-08-24 18:40:00,11391," It would boggle your mind!  When I had the pleasure of fishing Rainy with Simon, he was literally holding the camera in place with his hand holding the rod! Not sure if hes since upgraded? But yeah, I was shocked to see how well he filmed these videos while landing fish! Plus its a sweet angle   "
724844,RangerGuy,2012-08-24 18:55:00,564,Now that's a HOG!  Way to go!

I'll never understand this either. Thanks for sharing the video, it was a nice way to end the week!"
724853,Roy,2012-08-24 19:13:00,13728,"Those are world class walleye by anybody's standards, Simon. Congrats to you, you certainly put in the time. Thanks for sharing your story, pics and video. They're great!"
724862,Handlebarz,2012-08-24 19:54:00,3790,Awesome congrats on a wicked night simon
724892,spincast,2012-08-24 21:59:00,3279,Nice shooting Simon ! Congrats on the PB (but I still think you're a witch - you have to be charm those beauties day after day ). Must have been the graveyard shift was it? either that or the midnight sun still shines bright?  (edited for spelling)
724894,misfish,2012-08-24 22:02:00,29133,Why do all yer posts have bragging rights  Great job Simon and congrats.
724895,Joeytier,2012-08-24 22:03:00,3990,Now that's a fist full o' walleye!

724987,limeyangler,2012-08-25 14:20:00,5204," Thanks !    I went back last night....bit of a wash out by comparison...a 27"" and a 25"" for the 2 guests i had in the boat while i had to settle for a 16"" and a 6""!    Its been a cold August after a unusually hot, dry summer but despite the whacky weather they are pretty much where they were last year on this lake.    Thanks...it was a memorable session for sure.   Thanks Cliff!    I doubt they do grow fast...its pretty cold up here so they grow slow....i will say this though...they aint growing fast but they eat well!    Yup, next bechmark is to beat 33"".....might be a while, but i'll just soldier on...its a tough job but somebody has to do it.     Thanks man!      Exactly as Rick says..........  "
724990,limeyangler,2012-08-25 14:34:00,5204," Thanks RG...i was a little bit panicked not to lose it when i saw the size of it at the surface....lol.     Awesome way to end the week....the bozo was lucky my buddy Cliff was not with me....he fires large musky lures at encroaching boats!    Thanks Roy.....definitely glad i have pics and vids of this for wheni'm older to share around the campfire on my hologram device!    Thanks Mike.....i see you have been doing pretty good too on LSC!    It was after nightshift.....got out out at around 10am, LOL...witch...i'd be in big trouble if you accused me of that 400 years ago!    Thanks Brian....i am just a lucky so and so to live where i do.   LOL...thanks JT.    Thanks VT...it is my desktop background as of last night.    Thanks Paul!"
