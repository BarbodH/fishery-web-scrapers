722156,Default User,2012-08-12 23:42:00,72,A pick-up isn't a viable option for us - we're leaning towards a crossover or SUV.  Wife also prefers something brand new - that way if anything goes wrong - its MY fault and nobody else to blame   Any thoughts on the 2012 GMC Terrain?
722157,Grimace,2012-08-12 23:46:00,2020,If my old lady gave me too much grief over the truck I was going to go with a Grand Cherokee.
722158,bow slayer,2012-08-12 23:47:00,1074, I thought the Terrain was a 4 cylinder.
722159,BillM,2012-08-12 23:50:00,17367, Comes with either.
722162,SlowPoke,2012-08-13 00:07:00,2984,"I have a 2012 Ram 5.7 quad cab with 6000 kms so I can't say a lot about reliability at this point. It handles towing with ease and probably the most comfortable truck I've been in and I've owned Suburban's, Tahoe's, a full size van and a mid size van for towing. The ride is nothing short of amazing and it has plenty of power. Highway Ttowing fuel economy is abysmal averaging around 11-13 iMPG while highway driving without a load will get you about 18 iMPG. City driving is ranges around 12-14 iMPG. IN MY OPINION... The Ram is the best looking truck on the market right now with the best ride. Mine is fully loaded and I really enjoy it but all I need it for is towing the boat. I'm not sure it would make for a great daily driver/commute vehicle.  "
722180,Default User,2012-08-13 01:57:00,72,"  That's correct It's available in 2.4L 4cyl (1,500 lb towing capacity) and a 3.0 6cyl (3,000lb capacity)  We're leaning towards the 4-banger because of its fuel efficiency. And realistically, I would only be towing a tinny or John boat anyway.  I don't get to go fishing enough to justify a nice bass boat."
722181,Grimace,2012-08-13 01:59:00,2020,I hate to be off topic but I love that Starcraft Slowpoke.  This is my rig. 
722207,SlowPoke,2012-08-13 03:31:00,2984,Thanks! Every time I've had it out I get some nice compliments and I'll never get tired of hearing them.

I have put about 10k miles on it, I no longer drive enough to worry about fuel prices.  It pulls my 6x12 enclosed cargo trailer well, and it has 10 feet of floor space behind the seats if I need a nap."

722418,Cast-Away,2012-08-14 01:37:00,790,i just got my wife a brand new Sante Fe V6 AWD. We towed the Legend (2000lbs) last week and boy it was way more powerful than my 2003 Caravan with the 3.3L engine. The fuel ecomomy is 10.6L/100km. This is the best time of year to buy a new vehicle if you plan to keep it a number of years and not worry about trade in value.
722448,Dara,2012-08-14 03:03:00,3052,  This...is the only real tow vehichle out there.   Milage doesn't change with or without a trailer and you can't beat 5.7 litres for passing

722527,Matty,2012-08-14 16:06:00,19,I had a full size SUV (wont name names) that I thought was a great tow vehicle as it was pretty much as big as they came.  I now have a 2011 f150 Lariat Limited and I realize that my last vehicle wasnt far from a great tow vehicle.  It is hard for an SUV to beat a full size pick up for towing.  It also has a massive back seat for kids and dogs!
722558,scugpg,2012-08-14 18:49:00,1373," I would double check, in this guide it suggests trailer brakes are required over 1000lbs http://www.gmc.com/content/dam/GMC/global/master/nscwebsite/en/home/Vehicles/Shared_resource/pdf/2012-gmc-trailering-guide.pdf  It also weighs quite a bit for being pushed with a 3L engine.  My not try a 2012 Escape, they are clearing them out now as the new model just came out. 3.0L 4x4 is good on gas (8L/100 on the highway)but I wouldn't want to tow much over 2000lbs with it even though its rated for 3500. Depends what you want to tow now and how much down the road."

The 4 cyl version is only rated for towing 1500lbs , but I suspect with AWD it may work ok and the 4cyl is rated as the best suv on fuel.  It has an econo/sport button to change the tranny shift points."

721643,Default User,2012-08-10 20:33:00,72,"Just wondering what car, SUV, van or truck you folks use to haul your boat, trailer, etc.  I'm looking to step up from the little Mazda and get into something a little larger (growing family) and with more balls (excuse my language) Ultimately, my next vehicle is going to be the Daily Driver / grocery getter / kid hauler / weekend warrior  Eventually, I would like to see myself with a nice little bass boat (or at least a tinny) in the near future  Thanks in Advance"
721644,davey buoy,2012-08-10 20:38:00,5505, Most of the suv's are more than adequate. Also the ford F series of pick ups:good:
721645,Raf,2012-08-10 20:39:00,3495,Grand Cherokee v8 is my tow vehicle  I wouldn't advocate anything less than a v8 if you are planning on a bass boat.  Keep the Mazda for daily driving.  I keep an 'ole Tercel for my commuting (100+kms roundtrip daily) I come out ahead on monthly costs even after if you figure extra insurance/plates for second vehicle just by the fuel savings.

721748,Fang,2012-08-11 02:54:00,1330,"My Expedition has been an absolute dream to own. No real repairs in almost 10 years other than normal wear and tear on parts, 250,000 km and other than it's a thirsty boy at the gas pump I could not have had a better truck these last few years. It's getting a little long in the tooth and I've started looking at an Explorer and the Honda Pilot.  If you want to spend a day and test drive a few different truck head out to AutoPark. You can drive a Dodge, Ford, Nissan and anything else they have in the lot in an afternoon.  I was at Burlington location last week just to do my first walk through and probably be getting something new to me this fall. Also like the possibility of the Buick Enclave but need to do more research. My Expedition came from there and we bought my wife a GMC Envoy from Autopark Barrie a few years ago. Both have been great.  It's a fine balance between gas mileage and power and after 8 years of the V8 Expedition I'm looking more at a V6 now. I pull a 1750 Crestliner Fishhawk and could get away with a smaller V6 now. It's the 3rd row seating that I can't give up. With temagami trips, friends coming along with my 2 kids and hunting and fishing, having that extra room is so hard to give up.  Good luck in your search and be sure to share your test drive results.  FWIW, we test drove the Cadillac SRX's when we bought my wife's Envoy and broke 2 on the test drives."

Loaded with the weeks worth of kit, the family and the boat, no problem pulling, and it doesnt sit rear heavy as many smaller vehicles do, which is an issue if you are front wheel drive and trying to get out of a steep ramp. 4 wheel drive is sweet at the ramp, in the snow and on the rough roads. Mileage is decent, ride and room is phenomenal. 1 of only a few trucks recommended by the Lemon Aid guide - which by the way if you want to look at a copy of for 2011 trucks, let me know - Only downside ..the price of the cap - was over 2k to get it installed, ouch."

721805,Grimace,2012-08-11 13:20:00,2020,"I just picked up a 2012 Dodge RAM.  I think it has the sharpest interior and I really like the nav system/media centre .  It hauls my 17.5 aluminum like it isn't even there.  My dad has a GMC and it is also great.  If you get the full 4 door and a tonneau cover it is pretty much a great family machine as well.    Any of the full size trucks are really good in my opinion.  If you go the truck route, just choose the one that you like driving the best and hopefully that is the one that gives the best deal.  Some people have to believe for some reason that whatever truck/boat/product they purchased is the best.  This reminds me of a great Mark Twain quote. ""It is easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.""  All that really matters is that you bought the best product for you.  Good luck."
