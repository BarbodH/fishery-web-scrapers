I have had this reel open at least 5 times; but the reel has a tick and pulsation that it has never had before.  Upon opening the reel again after discovering the tick and pulse, it appears that the hammer looking component with the pointed head freely rotates and is able to work its way under and rub on the bail engage (dog eared) gear under the main gear. Pic included  Anyone have this issue before and or know how to fix it?  I have played with is quite a bit and getting frusterated as I end with the same result each time.  "

724957,F_ast,2012-08-25 07:56:00,154,Got it figured out.  The anti reverse pawl was got engaged on the AR gear and flicking the teeth as it ran by.  Thanks.
