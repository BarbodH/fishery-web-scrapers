Bringing the fishing gear to pass the time, just wondering if anyone knows what species i may catch?  I have been told I can fish right at the Inn, just wondering if there is any where close by that may be better.  Need to keep my 8 year old son occupied (ok maybe it's his 36 year old father that needs to be kept occupied....SO WHAT  LOL)  Any info would be great.    Thanks    Ian"
