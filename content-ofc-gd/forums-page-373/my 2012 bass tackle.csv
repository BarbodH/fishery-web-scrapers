703512,GreenCanada,2012-06-07 04:59:00,375,Slick selection. Looks like you have your bases covered.
703543,Jacob,2012-06-07 11:53:00,186,Great collection.
703549,Handlebarz,2012-06-07 12:05:00,3790,that's why I pay extra for tackle coverage w/ my boat insurance   I asked my insurance company about that for my boat as I would leave tackle in it at times for musky fishing which can easily be $3000 at retail prices they said there was no extra insurance for that I told them the prices but they still told me there was no extra insurance you might want to shop around for a different place. And yes I would be covered if it was all ripped off even if it was not locked up in the storage boxes.
703583,bucktail,2012-06-07 14:15:00,1857,Awesome collection but Pixie and Tierra have to be the worst names ever!
703597,johnnyb,2012-06-07 15:25:00,3413,I never thought Tierra was a bad name....but when you say it next to Pixie....yeah....sounds just like Tiara
703654,bigreddog,2012-06-07 18:48:00,84,"Well, the series of reels on which the current PX is based were in fact originally named Liberto Pixy.  The reels also featured the word 'Pixy' in a large scripted font on the palm sideplate, so it seemed the obvious choice for a nickname. I'm also sure that the fact that 'Liberto' doesn't exactly roll off the tongue had something to do with it as well.  I guess the Japanese are more *ahem* comfortable in this area. You should see what Megabass came up with their Pagani line -- pink butterflies, anybody?"
724998,belippy,2012-08-25 15:10:00,88,"ah long, where are all your cores? you sold them all?"

725275,belippy,2012-08-26 20:40:00,88,"How's the pxl-rs? I saw you have 3. How good are they in terms of smoothness, weight and power? Are they alot better than the D7 or maybe steez?"

703240,krixxer,2012-06-06 10:30:00,274,That is some nice gear!  I had my T3 out a few times this year; casting machine! but could be a bit smoother on the retreive.
703241,Roy,2012-06-06 10:52:00,13728,Ok now let's see your 2012 walleye tackle.  You got some quality gear there.
703242,MCTFisher9120,2012-06-06 10:56:00,3761,"Very nice collections of rods and reels, it really is nice when you get your techniques matched right down to the specific rod's and reels. Thanks for the post, might get some pictures up soon"
703244,Broker,2012-06-06 11:08:00,482,"lots of money put into that collection , looks good!"
703245,backbay,2012-06-06 11:27:00,773,"Gosh, you didn't just drink the Koolaid, you drank the whole jug! Fabulous collection Didn't you own a Smoke for 20 minutes or so last year?"
703246,danbouck,2012-06-06 11:34:00,4380,Can I borrow some money

703253,Gregoire,2012-06-06 11:50:00,1397,Nice collection. I'm waiting to see your spinning combos and a drop shot rig.

703259,Christopheraaron,2012-06-06 12:08:00,3525,"Can I invite you to my birthday, for a gift I like fishing stuff"
703265,Joeytier,2012-06-06 12:24:00,3990,Are you a Daiwa shareholder yet?  We're expecting big things
703278,jigsnreels,2012-06-06 13:14:00,133," Hey, a true artist never blames his tools.  Especially when there's so many other things to blame..."
703295,cynmar,2012-06-06 14:05:00,169,"God, that's a downpayment on a house. Nice gear but I sure as heck couldn't afford it, I'd be afraid to get it all wet."
703314,jedimaster,2012-06-06 15:14:00,3472,Thats a long rod for skipping. I switched to a 6' st.croix spinning rod for skippig and find it far more accurate. I can run it mush tighter to the water as well.
703321,ah_long,2012-06-06 15:35:00,354,I tried a shorter rod but I prefer to have the rod tip closer to the water for skipping  I'll be doing some pictures of my spinning gear soon... I have the following matched up Daiwa Certate 2500 HA w/ Rapala Concept Ti 6'8MH Daiwa Fuego 1500 w/ NRX Drop Shot  For Crappie Daiwa Certate Vintage Custom 1503 w/ TSR792 Shimano Sustain 1000 FG w/ TSR791  For Walleye the Rapala Concept Ti combo for bucktails Fuego 6'10 Medium w/ one of the Spinning reels I'm not using that day for lighter jig heads
703323,ah_long,2012-06-06 15:36:00,354," yup, had the smoke for a day, found a bunch of defects so I returned it"
703327,Rattletrap2,2012-06-06 15:46:00,1652,"Ah_Long, Can I make an assumption that you are a single man? LOL I know if I bought all them purty fishing rods/reels in a single year...that I would be!  Seriously, that is some nice stuff you go there! I would hate to take it out and get it all slimed up with moss and junk!"

703336,ah_long,2012-06-06 16:26:00,354, take it apart and put some hot sauce grease on the gears.. the T3 came poorly lubricated.. me and my buddies all have this issue. Hot Sauce fixed it
703466,krixxer,2012-06-07 00:11:00,274,I thought I'll have to pick up a wormgear bearing for it but I will try the lub job first.
703488,young_one,2012-06-07 02:10:00,620,Who likes to know where he lives and where he hides his fishing tackle? Bunch of garbage and usless fishing tackles.  Let's see your spinning gears!
