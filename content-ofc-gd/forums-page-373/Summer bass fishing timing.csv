724949,ra95,2012-08-25 02:53:00,49,What timing do you have most confidence on bass fishing? I voted for LM bass fishing at dawn around 6am-9am.
724954,OhioFisherman,2012-08-25 06:14:00,6623,"I have caught them at all hours of the day or night, but most of my biggest ones probably came between 10 am and 3 pm. I don`t worry about the time of day when bass fishing, unless it was getting close to weigh in time."
725007,ehg,2012-08-25 15:57:00,2666,"I kind of kept track of this. The biggest bass (over 6lbs) i caught were surprisingly always in last week of August, first week of September between 9am to 11am. This happened 4 times over 25 yrs. in Kawarthas.  The walleye/pickerel were first thing at dawn."
725192,Rich,2012-08-26 13:49:00,3927,"Numbers at dawn, excitement at dusk, and big girls through the day!"
725193,steverowbotham,2012-08-26 13:53:00,1800,"Rich said it best... I find the low light hours often produce more bites, but the sows come out to play in the heat!"
725212,Dave Bailey,2012-08-26 14:54:00,1641,"For me, being in my canoe means dawn. The winds are light or non-existent so you can easily paddle, and you don't have to worry about getting back in the dark. Plus if you want to do some photography it's impossible to beat morning light for beauty. And the fishing is great!  Well, it's great IF you're in the right spot AND you know what you're doing. Which means that for me the fishing is usually NOT great."
725217,backbay,2012-08-26 15:09:00,773,"Out of habit, and the fact that it's so peaceful, I always try to get out at first light. Given the choice between dawn and dusk, though, I would take dusk every time. Like the others have said, you can get good fish pretty much any time of the day, even on bluebird days...."
725349,Rich,2012-08-27 02:30:00,3927,"All i know is, i've never done well on numbers or size when i'm sitting at home"
725357,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-27 03:11:00,535,"A few years ago before I really got back into fishing, the biggest bass I caught all year was in the middle of summer, 1pm on a VERY hot day (it was over 40 degrees). I was sweating just standing there up to my knees in the water. Then I had some old guy driving by stop his truck and tell me I was going to get cancer because I was standing knee deep in the moira river haha."
725358,ttahhan,2012-08-27 03:20:00,191,Success for myself has been early morning 5am-10am When season starts to 4pm-8pm late August and through September This applies to the Kawaratha's Rice Lake
