Topwater, lipless cranks and dropshot soft plastic minnows all produced fish-nothing gigantic but some decent 18 & 19 inchers.  "
724850,jimmer,2012-08-24 19:06:00,2730,Sweet! Always nice to get into the smallies no matter what size they are.
724897,Jigger,2012-08-24 22:12:00,1237,Noticed last weekend that the bigger fish that were missing in July have started to show up. Nice fish fb! You out there this weekend?
725018,Rod Caster,2012-08-25 16:51:00,5784,"I fished some Haliburton smallies for the first time last week and also quite well. A few 4 pounders and I was a happy man. All caught using 4"" grubs with jig heads, very slow retrieve, lots of pauses."
725067,fishboy,2012-08-25 20:55:00,550, thanks Jigger... I won't be out this weekend- the youngest has her soccer final tourney... how about you ?
725069,davey buoy,2012-08-25 21:03:00,5505,"Nice catch,the smallies are on fire everywhere !!!!!!!!!!!"
725072,Jigger,2012-08-25 21:13:00,1237,"Yup, got out for about 2hrs this aft. Non stop the whole time! Biggest was creeping on 20"". Just got a txt from a buddy across the way downrigging and doubleheaded a laker and a 4lb smallie. Theyre hitting great right now! Cant wait for the evening bite!"
