724405,Cudz,2012-08-22 19:43:00,2652,"I got out on Somcoe today for 6 hours.  I managed 3 smb and 1 perch and my buddy managed 2 perch total.  I went to most of my spots and I also made the trek to Thorah!!!!  I did well on openning day but since then it has been a struggle getting quality fish (mid you this is only my thord time out looking for them this summer).  I know I have said this before, but something is different out there. Hardly any follow ups either.  On a related side note. This morning while fishing Thorah I watched thousands of comorants fly from Thorah to Geogina Island.  It was a dense black cloud of comorants that actually stretched the distance between the two islands. I was shocked at the numbers.  THey were in the thoudands.  Maybe that where all the perch have gone."
724407,bushart,2012-08-22 19:48:00,2628,May not be just Simcoe  I'm gettin bad reports from too many places
724410,davey buoy,2012-08-22 19:52:00,5505,"You didn't see Pete bowman did you? 20-30' off drop offs,he was catching 6lb plus SM .Tons there .Maybe try a tad deeper."
724412,Garnet,2012-08-22 20:01:00,2056,It's not summer. It's fall you missed it.
724431,misfish,2012-08-22 21:25:00,29133,"If your not getting them Chis,theres a problem."
724440,Rod Caster,2012-08-22 21:46:00,5784,This is why you don't take a break from fishing
724466,Master of Bait,2012-08-22 23:48:00,196,"Hey Cudz,  Tough luck - it's a wacky weather year, that's for sure.  March was HOT, April was cool, and it's been a hot summer since then - so I expect some usual patterns are a bit out of whack.  I only fished Simcoe once this year (July).  Fished my usual spots, maybe a bit deeper, and did pretty well, hooking two 5+ hogs and numerous smaller fish, plus the standard jumbo perchies I always pick up when bass fishing.  That's the only tip I can offer (fish deeper).  Good luck out there.  MoB"
724469,captpierre,2012-08-23 00:04:00,2521,I know someone that has property on Thorah and they were given a permit by the MNR to shoot as many cormorant as they can whenever they want.  Could this be true?
724487,walleyemaster,2012-08-23 01:34:00,325,dont know about the bass but the lakers are on.. im killing them. and great fun also
724488,Cudz,2012-08-23 01:43:00,2652,deeper it is. I pulled one from 25 today. One form 14 and one from 8 so I hit up everything but not enough time spent in the 20+. Thanks guys
724496,Skipper D,2012-08-23 02:20:00,1970,"I am unable to find any thing this year in my spots each time i've been  out  , maybe i need the bigger boat in the water ... lol , thought the next time  out i'd try fishing every where on Simcoe i'v never fished before and see what that dose for me ."
724508,Cudz,2012-08-23 05:37:00,2652,"Anyway, I will redeem myself in the fall. That is the best time for huge fish anyway."
724511,singingdog,2012-08-23 11:01:00,1047, Join the club. The bite is quirky on the lakes that I fish: really tough to establish a pattern.
724512,krixxer,2012-08-23 11:06:00,274,Simcoe changes from week to week.  Last week I managed 1 bass and a dozen bullheads.  I think I'll leave the bassin' for you guys; this weekend I'll be perchin' .... Donâ€™t buy up all the minnows!!!!  
724514,mike rousseau,2012-08-23 11:37:00,4661,Not just simcoe  We are seeing strange patterns on the st.lawrence also...
724571,J.C.,2012-08-23 15:55:00,11,I am relatively new to fishing Smcoe. Not much luck in the shallower water so I am thinking you guys are right and I should try deeper.
724657,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 00:31:00,5865,"Fishing is NEVER the same as last year......and it's never as good, and never as bad as you hear it is or last year........this has held true for every lake I have fished in the last 40+ years."
724725,krixxer,2012-08-24 10:46:00,274," don't tell me that, I have a trip up the the nations in a few weeks."
724934,northernpike56,2012-08-25 00:57:00,717,"I couldn't catch anything when I went out on Simcoe, as well as every other place I fish. I have caught about 1/2 of the fish that I did last year, and that includes everything from small stream brookies to open water fishing on big lakes. I think it must be the weather, because I'm doing all the exact same things I did last year. I haven't even caught a pike over 30"" this year!!!! Hopefully next year will be better, because I'm feeling like I suck this season."
