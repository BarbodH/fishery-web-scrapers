I do not have a boat so I must be able to either rent a boat, or fish from shore.  I would be curious to know about shore fishing opportunities, if any, for salmon and trout at this time of year.   Also interested in just about any other species available as well.  Any information you could share would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.  Millhouse"
467899,pikeguy,2010-05-19 19:15:00,195,"My tip is not to go to the island this weekend. The natives are protesting the new HST and according to the news they are planning to shut down the only road to the island. Just a suggestion its up to you if you want to go,may have to sit there for a while before you get true would not want anybody to waste the weekend on account of this and i did not say anything    good luck and happy fishing                                                       http://www.sudburystar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2583778"

Unfortunately for me there is no turning back since my girlfriend is working there for the next couple of months so I am going to visit.  We both just thought it would be fun to get out fishing and also to see some of the Manatoulin Island sites :-)  Cheers!"
467927,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-19 21:32:00,0,enjoy!  it's a beautiful place.  i've spent a fair bit of time on the island but i can't help much with the shore fishing.  i can help with restaurants if you're interested.  there are some gems.

468372,skunked,2010-05-21 12:16:00,41,"Hey, I have in laws on the island, I go up there a few times a year. A boat is really essential. and there is a lot of private property around most lakes. sucker lake is good for walleye, musky and bass. Bass lake..  land the great lake manitou. full of whitefish, lake trout,  walleye, jumbo perch, bass.. head into the town of manitowaning, go into the musky widows tavern, say hi to norma and mike from jordan! and ask where you can go fish..   give it a shot. ask questions and buy some food as well! good luck and have a blast for all of us who cant get away!"
