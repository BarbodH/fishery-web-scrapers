468170,bassjnkie,2010-05-20 17:42:00,1101,I have a carp bait bag that the main zipper broke off. I want to replace it with a new large tooth zipper. I went to some local places today and no one is able to do it for me. Does anyone know where I can get this done?
468173,Fishnwire,2010-05-20 17:49:00,983,"I've asked my wife to repair pants with a broken zipper and she told me to just buy another pair of pants.  She said she can do it, but it's a fair amount of work and buying a new zipper makes it almost as cheap to just buy another cheap (that's all I wear) pair of pants. - I'm not sure how much your bag is worth and/or how attatched you are to it, but in today's throw-away world, you may be better of just to do that. - If you really want to get it done, you could try a place that does boating apolstery...seat covers and other leather/vinyl work.  I'm sure anything is possible for a price.   Good luck."

468180,Wally,2010-05-20 18:11:00,28,"  If its the slider thats broke ,you can get a zipper repair kit. I've fixed tent zippers , life jacket zippers , coats , etc ."
468193,TC1OZ,2010-05-20 19:13:00,987,"Damn! Sorry dude... I guess the guy near me has a queer eye for a straight guy! hahaha. He'll fix anything he knows how to..has a little kiosk in the mall. Does leather, boot, shoe, and stitching repairs. Maybe it is worth getting a new one, I'm sure the place in your signature will hook you up."
468198,Roy,2010-05-20 19:57:00,13728,I don't know what the bag looks like but can you not use two strips of Velcro on the inside?
468200,bassjnkie,2010-05-20 20:16:00,1101,"I was thinking of the velcro, but decided just to get a better bag shipped from the UK. Thanks for the help."

468239,bassjnkie,2010-05-20 23:13:00,1101,I have a boat and lucky no problems yet. Except for maintenance. Fingers crossed.
