468483,ems3,2010-05-21 17:20:00,1,"I have been coming here fishing, a week per year in early June, about 5 years in the 1970's and then again for the last few years. We stay at Jake's Blue Roof Cottages and fish for pike. The pike fishing is great and I know where to find them. I have always heard there are walleye here but never have caught one nor seen anyone else catch one. I have heard ""up by the lock,"" tried there with no success, but the location seems too general. Plus, I am used to lake fishing for walleye so I have no feel for what would be a good spot for river fishing for walleye or what I should be throwing at them to get them to bite. I will be back again this year in June and any hints, suggestions and specifics would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.  "
