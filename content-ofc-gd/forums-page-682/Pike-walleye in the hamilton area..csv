468266,JamieM,2010-05-21 01:08:00,22,  The waterford ponds have pike.
468268,basketclam,2010-05-21 01:16:00,115,"You may find that you're a bit late for the really shallow pike.  They spawn pretty early in the year, typically JUST after ice out.  With the warm spring, they may have started to move a bit deeper by now?  As for walleye in the Hamilton area, I couldn't even begin to provide any advice."
468315,Lunatic,2010-05-21 03:37:00,536,Thanks guys. i had no idea waterford ponds had pike. thought it was mostly bass and crappie. but i think i might get the raft out and get off the shore. i'll give waterford a shot.
