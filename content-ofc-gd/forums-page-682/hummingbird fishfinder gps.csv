467886,archer379,2010-05-19 18:22:00,277,i have been looking at fishfinder gps combo something like the hummingbird 385 or 387. i am wondering about the gps how does it work with out the navonics maps or do i have to buy the maps
467896,Fang,2010-05-19 19:00:00,1330,"I have a 787 without a map card. I will be getting the Canadian maps this year but have used it for ice and spring fishing so far. On most of the big lakes it will show a rough outline of the lake (water in blue, land in green). Shorelines are a little inaccurate and of course you don't get the lake depths unless you get the map."

467965,smally21,2010-05-19 23:49:00,993,i have a 580 combo. internal maps are okay for direction and navigation but not for depth. navionics cards are compatible.
467998,Moosebunk,2010-05-20 00:55:00,3970,"Got the 587ci combo here... so far, with Navionics chip in... I've still managed to only hit two shoals this month. lol.  Chip does help though, could've been worse.."
468026,curlrap,2010-05-20 01:44:00,58,I just bought the 597ci last week but did not get a chip yet. What's the best or cheapest  card to get for ontario lakes? Does Walmart or BPS sell these cards?
