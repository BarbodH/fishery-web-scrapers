468356,Stoty,2010-05-21 11:49:00,2910,"Yes, you should be looking out for the little ninja's that keep putting things in your cart because of all the great deals!  Sure makes the total add up fast!!  Enjoy!"
468363,bigugli,2010-05-21 11:59:00,6138,Easy to max out your CC on all the toys and gadgets at a BPS or Cabelas.    I figure my credit would hold up for about an hour.   I lock it up in the trunk  The bins in the aisles are where you find a lot of the feature and clearance items. Picked up 10 x-raps @ $4 a pop one year.
468364,robertag,2010-05-21 12:01:00,42,"I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. I live about 5 minutes from BPS.  So I don't go crazy every time I set foot in there, knowing I can go back anytime... and I do!"
468366,lew,2010-05-21 12:07:00,12766,If it's the Nashville BPS your heading to you may want to change your plans. Evidentely they received alot of damage from the recent flooding and lost most of their inventory.  Supposedly shut down until around next Christmas.
468395,irishfield,2010-05-21 13:25:00,26272,Yep you could boat right thru the store in a Cracker Lew!
468396,Raf,2010-05-21 13:26:00,3495, the directions to Cabelas.
468399,lew,2010-05-21 13:29:00,12766," Well, 1/2 ways anyhow Wayne, until it sprung the inevitible Cracker leak and went to the basement"
