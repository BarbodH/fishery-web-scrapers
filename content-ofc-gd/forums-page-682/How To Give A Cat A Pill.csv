467917,wolfville,2010-05-19 20:37:00,396,"I am in the same boat, my older cat takes 2 pills a day now. And every time it's a brand new adventure.  Grid it to powder? I tried, the powder all ends up on her fur.  Put in tuna? Okay, I tried tuna, salmon, turkey, beef, ... whatever you add the powder in, it won't be touched by the cat.  The only thing that worked to certain degree for us is to dissolve the pill in small amount of water, use a syringe to inject into cat's mouth. You still need to figure out how to get the cat to open up, but at least you normally get it done this way with less than 3 attempts ;-(  I found this on internet while researching cat constipation problem, and believe me, it's funny  Gave my cat an ENEMA last night"
