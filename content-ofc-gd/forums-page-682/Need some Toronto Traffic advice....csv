468214,motion,2010-05-20 21:40:00,403,"TJ, I'll agree with Wayne. You should be ok at 11:00 AM but you never know in the big smoke......................."
468218,bridge,2010-05-20 21:54:00,54,"don't be to quick to say your okay at 11 am all it takes is one accident and everything is backed up.  If you take the Allen to Bathurst route, if you go just east of Bathurst you hit Spadina which goes right down to the harbour front to but its kind of a nice drive.  You can see Castle Lowma?? (sp)."
468219,motion,2010-05-20 21:58:00,403, As I said............You SHOULD be ok. I'll agree an accident or unscheduled road work can change things quickly. Maybe TJ should drive to Yorkdale Mall and take the TTC.

468221,bridge,2010-05-20 22:03:00,54,the mall parking garage is under cunstruction not as many spots availible.  not a bad idea though.
468242,discophish,2010-05-20 23:45:00,392, We're practically neighbours!  I can probably reach your place with my 3 iron ... if I hit the ball after a few cans of Red Bull and a generous serving of spinach!
468245,ketchenany,2010-05-21 00:00:00,3229,"As I suggested an Alice Cooper CD and a cold one in the yard! Light a fire if you want the smoke affect  If you do come, leave the T . . u at home, we have enough problems with crowd control.  Have fun, most of the crowd will be heading your way!"
468249,Fisherman,2010-05-21 00:10:00,7201,"Jeez, get Wayne to fly you down and boot you out on a static chute from 600, won't be too far off the mark and you'll have enough gawkers to point you in the right direction."
468256,SBCregal,2010-05-21 00:40:00,688,woohooo....confirmed that we'll be there too!  gonna get there a bit early and maybe make a few casts while having a beverage or two.
468258,TJQ,2010-05-21 00:46:00,7806, LOL.. Hey Dunner.. it should be fun... I think we better leave tonight if I wanna make it though......
468261,SBCregal,2010-05-21 00:58:00,688,that MAY be a good idea!  I have to come up with a way to get out of work early tomorrow now.  at least we dont have the drive you have ahead of you.
468311,jjcanoe,2010-05-21 03:17:00,744,listen to 680am and they have a traffic report every 10 mins ( on the 1's) it is very trustworthy and they'll let you know where the backups are  jjcanoe
468337,Handlebarz,2010-05-21 08:05:00,3790,Tj put the AM dial (yes I know that is all you have for the North CBC radio) But down here you want to listen to AM 680 they have traffic every 10 min on the 1's LOL it is very god and will give you heads up on problems.  Enjoy the show
468369,dave524,2010-05-21 12:09:00,4508,"Save yourself a lot of headaches, for the past ten years coming into anything at the Convention Centre, Air Canada Centre, CNE etc or even stuff like the Museum and downtown businesses I just drive from Grimsby to the Burlington GO train, hop on and get TTC tokens at Union station if required, not much more than the parking if I drove and a lot less stressful. Maybe there is something coming from the north that could work like this for you."
468136,TJQ,2010-05-20 16:05:00,7806,Ill be in Toronto tomorrow morning around 11... Ill be coming south on the 400... I need to get to the Toronto Waterfront... Is it better to go via the Gardiner or Don Valley Pkway.. or is there a quicker/easier route for us Northern hicks....
468138,Raf,2010-05-20 16:12:00,3495," Don Valley Parking Lot is propably too far east.  If you want to stay on the hwys, I'd take the 400 -> 401 West -> 427 South -> QEW/Gardiner East.  Otherwise, take the Allen Rd to Eglinton East.  Then south on a major artery.  Have fun."
468140,Headhunter,2010-05-20 16:14:00,5703,"TJ... traffic should not be a problem at that time and date... I would take 400 south to the 401 west, than take 427 south to the QEW/Gardiner east to get downtown. Taking the DVP puts you pretty far east, only to travel south and west on the DVP to get downtown. HH"
468141,fishnsled,2010-05-20 16:14:00,3520,"I'd just stay where you are TJ, that's what I'd do.  I know that the Gardiner is under construction and down to 2 lanes each way at the Jameson bridge. Might be easier to go the DVP, at least there is no construction on it.       EDIT -  The Allen Rd route is a bit more direct. (as Raf said.)  I'd turn left at Eglinton and right onto Bathurst down to the Lakeshore."
468142,ketchenany,2010-05-20 16:15:00,3229,DON'T TAKE THE GARDNER it's under construction at Jamison; both ways  DVP/404 would be your better bet . . .
468144,Headhunter,2010-05-20 16:15:00,5703,Raf beat me to it! HH
468145,Raf,2010-05-20 16:16:00,3495,Get off @ Jameson or even Humber Bridge then and take Lakeshore.
468146,ketchenany,2010-05-20 16:21:00,3229," Jameson ramp is also closed, I work at Dufferin and King and it isn't pretty"
468147,fishnsled,2010-05-20 16:23:00,3520, I would imagine it's the back ups getting to the bridge that are the killer but I come in from the east so I don't know for sure.
468148,Headhunter,2010-05-20 16:23:00,5703,"I used to be such a sweet sweet thing, till they, got a hold of me I opened doors for little old ladies, I helped the blind to see I got no friends cause they read the papers, they can't be seen, with me, Feel free to carry on! HH"
468149,Raf,2010-05-20 16:28:00,3495," That does sound ugly..  TJ I'd take the 400 to 401 east to Allen Rd South to Eglinton, hang a left then make a right on Bathurst like fishnsled and I mentioned earlier.  You'll hit a backup on the Allen as you get to Eglinton but it should be ok otherwise."
468150,TJQ,2010-05-20 16:29:00,7806,Wow.. Im glad I asked!! ALICE COOPER HERE WE COME!!!
468151,fishnsled,2010-05-20 16:29:00,3520," And I'm gettin' real shot down And I'm feelin' meanNo more Mister Nice Guy No more Mister Clean No more Mister Nice Guy They say he's sick, he's obscene  LOL!!"
468153,Roy,2010-05-20 16:35:00,13728,Don't drink the Kool-Aid! Just a small mouthful of that stuff and they'll have you buying Maple Leaf T-shirts for the whole family.
468155,ketchenany,2010-05-20 16:42:00,3229,"  Getting off at Lawrence is even better, very little or no back up and then a right at Bathurst, did it for 10 years.  OR  Put an Alice Cooper CD, sit in the yard with a cold one! Because if you are heading back north Friday evening it won't happen.  I take the Friday before a long weekend off when I can."
468156,Raf,2010-05-20 16:46:00,3495, I like option #2.  That lawrence exit causes my blood pressure to rise unless I am one of the last minute mergers instead of waiting in line like everyone else.
468157,fishnsled,2010-05-20 16:50:00,3520,"  It's only if you drink the blue Kool-Aid Roy, it's hard to find right now anyways.  There was an increase in the Red Kool-Aid for a while and that was horrible.  People were buying Canadien jersey's!!"
468160,irishfield,2010-05-20 17:06:00,26272,TJ... 400.. off at Black Creek Drive. Follow it all the way down and when you go under the railway bridge you/and all traffic flow basically is turning left. I can't remember what friggin street it is.. follow it for a mile or so (and it runs East) past the leather factory etc and then the road bends/ turns South again and goes right down along the east side of High Park right to Lakeshore. Hang a left onto Lakeshore... I've done all the routes for over 30 years and that is the fastest to Ontario Place/Air Canada centre/Front St.
468164,ketchenany,2010-05-20 17:21:00,3229," Irish, that street is called Weston Road; turns into Keele Street at St Clair which turns into Parkside below Bloor.  I do it every day but don't go all the way to Lake Shore"
468172,kickingfrog,2010-05-20 17:49:00,8333," That's my route of choice as well, although I don't know what the current road construction situation is."
468182,discophish,2010-05-20 18:30:00,392,"Yup, this is the quickest route.  I live at College and Bathurst.  When I come back into the city from the cottage, I take Black Creek right off the 400.  Black Creek turns into Weston turns into Keele turns into Parkside!  Don't let that intimidate you, it's one continuous street!  Parkside ends at the Lakeshore, hang a left towards the Harbour.  You are there quick and easy! "
468184,TJQ,2010-05-20 18:35:00,7806,Awesome Thanks!!!
468199,SBCregal,2010-05-20 19:59:00,688,"if all goes well, i'll be at that show as well.  anyone else??? plans are to drive down, hang out a bit in the parking lot before the show... behaving of course  if you see a guy with a long goatee, bald, with a chick that looks out of his league, sitting behind a green safari... say hi! there may even be refreshments there!  ryan"
468203,ehg,2010-05-20 20:26:00,2666,"Grace and Harbord here. The above route is probably the quickest, but going to the Allen then down Bathurst to Lakeshore or Front might be less mental stress. Be prepared to pay lots for parking, you will be towed or ticketed otherwise."
468206,HTHM,2010-05-20 20:49:00,4082,"Avoid the traffic alltogether, but a flight from Porter and fly into the downtown airport...."
