Requires Ultralight pilot permit and registration in Canada.  Google Polaris flying boats... heck here's the link. http://www.polarismotor.it/  We've got a komakazi here in town with one.. or at least we did. I think he busted every aviation rule in the book and the boating laws to boot..."

468511,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-21 19:19:00,10439,  Got any idea how much these things are?
468564,irishfield,2010-05-21 23:19:00,26272,"Theres's a 10 year old used one in Michigan for $15,000. Probably grab an almost new one for $25k. New I think they're $40,000 !!!!  A zodiac... add a hang glider wing and a $7000 Rotax 582. Guess it all adds up. Be sure if you pursue.. 582 liquid cooled. Do not go with the 502/503"
468597,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-22 00:56:00,10439,  If I'm spending $40K on anything it will be a Snobear!!! I'll get way more use out of it.  It would be cool to have one though.
