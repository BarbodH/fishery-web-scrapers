From what I have been able to find out they are where they shouldn't be.If that sounds confusing it sort of is,a few guys have lucked into where they are but most are still searching.The ones that know are NOT telling where the fish are or what they are using.I have seen boats out trolling just before and after dusk but have no idea if they where catching or just feeding the bugs. Where is the cottage you are staying,I am on Pigeon at White Birches Camp maybe we can hook up while you are up here.I should have more info by Thursday.  vance"
