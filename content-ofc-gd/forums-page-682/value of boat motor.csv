467854,archer379,2010-05-19 16:46:00,277,I found the boat listed below and am wondering if anyone knows what the motor would be worth i am trying to decide if it would be worth buying it and selling my 1999 70 hp johnson 2 stroke i have contacted the seller and he is asking 6000 for just the motor but if i bought the hole thing switched the motors and then sold the boat. Does any one know anything about these motors. whats a fair price for the motor?  whats a fair price for my 99 70hp ?      http://peterborough.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-powerboats-motorboats-Deck-Boat-19-Ft-Aluminum-W0QQAdIdZ205133625

467875,trevy727,2010-05-19 17:28:00,351,"  I'd say that $6000.00 for that motor is a very fair price if it's as good as the add says. ""bought new in '06"" ""hardly used"".  If your 99 70hp is in great shape, you should get $3200.00-$4000.00? That's my guess. I'm no professional but I've been looking around for boats and motors for a while and just got one excactly what I was looking for."
467888,grt1,2010-05-19 18:25:00,638,I got a price on a 99 90hp merc here in Red Lake and they wanted $3000 and anothe $500 for the controls
467904,landry,2010-05-19 19:32:00,1005,I had the 70 hp version of that motor - assuming it is a 4 stroke. It was quiet and never gave me problems. That is a weird lookin boat - may be hard to get much for it.
468088,Jer,2010-05-20 11:34:00,1426,"  That may be a bit rich. I have the 2000 model year of the same motor, bought brand new for less than $5000.  I would be surprised if I could sell it right now for more than $2000 or $2500."
468093,Fish Farmer,2010-05-20 11:54:00,2234,"Motor in the picture is a 115 Johnson 4 stroke, that motor was made buy Suzuki. I'd say your 70 should be worth 3000 if in good shape."
