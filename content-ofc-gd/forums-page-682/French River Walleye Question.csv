Newish to walleye fishing and wondering what depths I should be targeting?  Will they go deep mid-day this time of year?  I have read so many different articles that I am almost confused.  Some said fish shallow....like 3-6 feet, some said target 10 feet.....any advice you can offer would be great so that I have a starting point.  Thanks in advance."

They are light hitters so you will need to ""sweep"" your rod to hook set instead of ""snap"" it like with bass. You will probably get a couple pike and cats as well. Don't be afraid to cook up the cats, they are tasty. Good luck!  Mark"
