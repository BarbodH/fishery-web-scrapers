467134,Roy,2010-05-17 12:50:00,13728,"I had a wonderful time Saturday with Lloyd (Fishhunter), Jose and Radar. Got down to the dock around 5:15 Saturday morning and Lloyd was just putting away the breakfast dishes. Jose and Radar showed up minutes later and we waited for a 4th guy. At 6 it was time to leave. Beautiful day though with lots of sun and a light breeze. Here are a few action and money shots of the guys... none of me in there...it turns out that you have to be on the OTHER side of the camera to be in the pic.            Here's a shot of captain Jose!    Cutest fish of the day.                    Mr. Machete man.    And here's the thank you shot.    I had a great time on the bay with you guys. Looking forward to doing it again, Lloyd."
