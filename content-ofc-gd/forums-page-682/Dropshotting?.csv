468023,chong,2010-05-20 01:37:00,102,I started to dropsot recently for walleye and didn't have to much success.What is the proper technique?Is it like jigging? What is the proper way to move my rod?   Thanks for you help.
468028,kickingfrog,2010-05-20 01:46:00,8333,"I would say less is more. Watch your drop shot at the side of the boat. Try to keep it still, it's hard to do if you've tied it right. Keep the movements subtle. If the fish want aggressive movements a jig or other presentation might be a better option. Play with the length of your dropper too.  Good luck."
468110,walleyemen,2010-05-20 13:24:00,316,"Dropshoting has been around for years and is fairly simple, and keep it just that!It's mostly designed to suspend your bait off the bottom, your lead is important as well, the more of the line angle the more line you need out to adjust for distance off the bottom, verticle dropshoting is intended to have the weight stationary while you have a sightly slacker line above it to allow you to twitch or shake the bait, you don't need to be agressive, thats what jigging is for, dropshoting is ment to be more subtle, there really is no wrong way to dropshot, everyone has their own version off it, you just need to find what works best for you, spend a day on the water and do nothing but dropshoting and you'll find what works for you.
