466230,Jackie,2010-05-13 23:25:00,124,"and 1- 4"" sunfish haha...nice catch"
466233,Twocoda,2010-05-13 23:36:00,4130,i bet that sunfish is pissed you didnt catch the pike a half hour earlier...

468335,chefboi17,2010-05-21 07:21:00,128,"looks like you missed a bit of meat by the tail, in the video the guy says to start at the anal vent and fillet from that point back to the tail"
