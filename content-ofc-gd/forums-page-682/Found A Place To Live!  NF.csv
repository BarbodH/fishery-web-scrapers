467656,solopaddler,2010-05-19 00:57:00,8605," Thanks buddy. It's funny you mention Attawapiskat.  After the deal was finalized my wife called me and expressed some, um,  ""reservations"" that I'm still going on this trip.  I agreed with her, said you know you're right I probably shouldn't go with a June 25th closing. Told her I'd call the boys tomorrow and let 'em know.  Then she pauses and says, no you really should go, I know it's important to you etc, etc..  Women    I love my wife."
467667,Spiel,2010-05-19 01:14:00,9065," Cool, I'm happy for you and your family Mike and you'll be 5 minutes closer to me now, no excuse not to come out and see you once in a while.   "
467669,solopaddler,2010-05-19 01:18:00,8605, You bet Chris and thanks.
467943,Kingsalmon,2010-05-19 23:06:00,107,"Hey Solo,  the Aquatherm thing posted previously is probably not what you have since that thing would not save  energy by pulling heat off the water heater.  Besides that technology is thirty years old.  I am 99% sure that you have some water lines entering the furnace other than the lines to the water heater.  The lines are routed into a pond or some other water source, maybe a well or septic.  The system circulates a water/antifreeze mixture and heat is exchanged through an exchanger at the source and at the furnace.  The lines to the water heater are actually for helping heat the water in the heater thus reducing your electric consumption further.  Considering the governement was giving about $8500 towards new installations this would explain why it is new.  My unit is twenty years old And still runs well but new units are 40% more efficient than mine.  I figure it costs about $300-400 dollars a month to heat/cool our 3500 sqft plus finished basement year round.  Forgot to mention that cooling is done through the same system just in reverse ie warm water is discarded through the exchanger.  If you need any other info about these units just ask, I studied the whole situation before the Internet was around."
467948,solopaddler,2010-05-19 23:12:00,8605, Thanks for the reply.  My first thought is you have one massive basement LOL!  Don't think you're right though. There's also a less than 1 year old standard air conditioner installed outside this house.
468057,Kingsalmon,2010-05-20 03:18:00,107," Well, I tried.  I would get the name of the guys that installed it, and poke them with a few questions, afterall, they will probably service it if it breaks down.  Best of luck."
468059,spinnerdoc,2010-05-20 03:35:00,556,"my boss has a similar set up if not the same and he says it costs a fortune to install but worth it .so i guess you are lucky to have such a system. according to him it is very comfrtable in the summer . it all depends i gues how your windows are located. he says its about 20deg. in the summer and the only draw back is in the colder days in the winter it gets cold and e has electric  heaters to assist but for the most part he does not need it.he has a big house by the way and he is around orangevile area.  he said like yours the heating is looped to the central duct system. so i would imagine there would be a kind of fan and rad inside the duct system. congrats on the new place mike  from what he explained to me, its a closed looped system that the pipes containing the liquid goes underground and picks up temps from the ground which is usualy cooler than above ground in the summer and the reverse in the winter....i think they go at least 6ft down.  with regards to heat...my boss's takes water and goes through some kind of gyro thing that spins around loops in high speed and the water heats up and that's where you get the heat from."
467565,solopaddler,2010-05-18 20:45:00,8605,"As many of you guys know it's been a stressful couple of weeks.  On the plus side we sold our house in Grimsby privately in a week simply by sticking a sign in the lawn.  On the downside the closing is June 25th and we've been scrambling to find something to purchase.  Arriving back from my brook trout trip we drove through the night and I got home around 9am. Was home for an hour and my wife had me out the door looking at 5 properties LOL!  We've looked relentlessly for the last 8 days with zero luck. In fact it's been amazingly depressing. Probably been through 30 or more houses in a very specific search area. In this sellers market anything decent in my area is going very quickly, many times for more than list. Most of the properties are just gross.  Anyhow we looked at a property on Sunday and loved it to death. It's a massive upgrade in every way to our current place in Grimsby, and needless to say we put an offer in.  Just received the official word that it's ours. Guys I'm so happy right now you wouldn't believe it!  Anyhow I have a question.  Apparantly there's a new ""Aqua Thermal"" furnace in this house. I've never even heard of the term before. I searched on the net and there's very little info out there..  Is anyone familiar with these things? Are they any good?  Thanks"
467568,Gerritt,2010-05-18 20:54:00,6129,"Water Source Heat Pump... same idea as a ground source heat pump.  The one issue i have seen with this setup, is while the heat may be free... the hydro to power the system is not.  I built a massive high end house in The Bridle Path area. Albeit it was a geo thermal system... hydro bills were close to 2k a month!  Mind you this was a HUGE modern house...  Ask to see the electric bill... especially in the winter months.  G  Edit to add... Do you if they are using radiators or in floor?"
467572,wuchikubo,2010-05-18 21:02:00,1114,Don't know much about the aqua thermal. But congratulations none-the-less! Now I can look forward to some more fish porn posted by you.
467573,solopaddler,2010-05-18 21:04:00,8605,  Thanks for the info Gerritt. I'll get more info on the unit later this week.  But all I know it's a standard duct system with a fan driven furnace. It's hooked up in conjunction with a normal looking water heater.  No rad's or in floor heating...
467574,Gerritt,2010-05-18 21:07:00,6129,seems a bit odd.. normally at least from what I have seen is the water is pumped to manifolds and distributed throughout the house... unless there is a heatpump involved as well I suppose exchanging the heated water to heated air.. I would be interested in seeing this system  So where abouts are you moving?
467575,Big Cliff,2010-05-18 21:08:00,6899, 2K a month? what part of the house was the grow op in?
467576,solopaddler,2010-05-18 21:18:00,8605," I'll let you know for sure. For what it's worth the guy said there was a 60% savings on heating bills.  We were specifically looking west mountain since I work at the airport and my wife in downtown Hamilton.  The place we bought is in a dead end street just off 20 Rd. Basically the corner of Garth and 20.  Great area, great house, wicked lot and most important great school right around the corner."
467577,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-18 21:33:00,10439,  You haven't seen the houses on the Bridle Path have you? The houses are so big they have multiple HVAC systems.
467578,Gerritt,2010-05-18 21:33:00,6129,LOL! this house was huge! extremely modern.. all the floor were light weight concrete.. it has been in a number of ads and commercials! they thought it would reduce costs.. but given the windows it hindered it!  My link
467584,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-18 21:48:00,10439, Ya broke your link Gerritt.  Here is my ex business partners place on Mississauga Rd. It is a little $$$$ to heat and such too. You have to go down to the bend in the road.  Little House on the River
467586,Terry,2010-05-18 21:58:00,14456,sounds like they just use a ground source heat pump and a heat exchanger to the plenum and duct work for heat and cooling from the ground source water  I like what I have read about it
467589,JohnF,2010-05-18 22:02:00,3494,I looked it up and here's what I found.  http://www.richardcollins.net/renheat_aquathermal.html
467590,JohnF,2010-05-18 22:03:00,3494, What's the water source?  JF
467592,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-18 22:05:00,10439,  It's a loop that is taken off the hot water heater.
467594,JohnF,2010-05-18 22:12:00,3494, Generally there's another source that extracts ambient heat or cold from available water like a pond or the grey water from the household plumbing. Taking it all from the water heater does nothing to conserve energy. It just puts all the heat generating pressure on the water heater. Sounds wrong to me.  Assuming there was another ambient source involved there would be a supplementary heating device in the furnace/fan unit.  JF
467598,HTHM,2010-05-18 22:17:00,4082,"So we ain't gonna be neighbours, eh? Congrads on the house!"
467608,solopaddler,2010-05-18 22:44:00,8605,   John that's not it at all. It's hooked up in conjunction with a standard water heater. I think there's simply a coil/heat exchanger in the outlet duct of the furnace that's fed from the hot water tank. Think of it as a giant version of a car heater.      Actually bud as the crow flies my new place is precisely 3.9km from your front door.
467616,JohnF,2010-05-18 22:59:00,3494, Some of the builders around here are now installing a furnace/water heater combo unit. I wonder if that's what you've got. I don't remember the brand names on the units.  JF
467620,Terry,2010-05-18 23:05:00,14456,"When a First Co. AquathermÂ® ""Combo Heater"" (air handler) is connected to an adequately sized natural gas, LP, or oil fired water heater, the water heater becomes a dual function appliance that can provide comfortable, efficient space heating as well as hot water for domestic use.  First installed in California in 1974, there are now over a million Combo systems in operation from Canada to Florida and in both single and multi-family applications.     ok that's interesting and no what I expected   I think to have the water the right temp for domestic hot water, the temp is too low for efficient heat exchange in the furnace..but who knows"
467621,solopaddler,2010-05-18 23:06:00,8605, I think it's pretty new technology at least in this area.  I'm just not sure if it's any good.  I hate being a guinea pig.
467626,Jer,2010-05-18 23:25:00,1426,  The hot water tank can be run at a higher temp and the domestic hot water supply can then be sourced through a tempering valve combining hot and cold water to reach the desired temp at your tap.
467629,Terry,2010-05-18 23:39:00,14456,"oh yeah, somewhere in my brain I knew that...LOL"
467636,danbouck,2010-05-19 00:11:00,4380,"I'll be in the Bridle Path area tomorrow, I'll ask a couple builders and see if they know anything about it."
467639,solopaddler,2010-05-19 00:17:00,8605, Thanks Dan
467648,rock34,2010-05-19 00:46:00,215,"Im glad you found a place Mike.  Not as glad as you I am sure though.....Attawapiskat here you come!  I dont know anything about that type of furnace but I could get any info that you want about it so let me know, what you need to know lol."
