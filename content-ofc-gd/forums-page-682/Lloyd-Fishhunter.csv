Will be fun regardless!!  Looks like two spots still open according to him in the hook up section. Was going to take my boat out on Sunday on Scugog, but, couldn't pass up this opportunity!!  Besides which, it will be alot more comfortable fishing out of Lloyds boat than my 14 foot aluminum in the rain Looking forward to learning some new trolling tricks!"
467587,Roy,2010-05-18 22:01:00,13728,"You'll have a good time for sure. Forecast for rain might be off by a day as it's only Tuesday but if it does rain, Lloyd's got you covered.  I'd like to have made this one too but I need to be FARRRRRRR outta town on the Monday and it would only give me 3-4 hours sleep. I know you and Juli will have a good time....take lots of pics for us illiterate folks.  I know that two more dudes will chime in cause this is too good a deal to pass up."
467588,Terry,2010-05-18 22:02:00,14456,"rain snow or wind his boat is well protected  and now with the DVD player and the bunk up front , it sounds like fishing could be secondary on lousy days"
467625,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-18 23:16:00,2690,"There will definitely be lots of pictures with Juli there...she takes about ten for every one I do.  Usually I'm too busy fishing As far as having us covered, saw the boat in your pictures, very nice rig!! Anybody else interested should definitely PM Lloyd...an amazing deal for a day of Quinte walleye!"

468419,daking_eh2007,2010-05-21 14:39:00,31,"Very excited! Looking forward to meeting you guys on Sunday. Went out with Lloyd twice last fall and everytime it was a blast even with 65kph wind and 4 ft waves, we still manage to boat some good sized 'eyes."
468444,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-21 15:32:00,2690,"The weather is looking great for Sunday...cloudy with sunny periods, 10 km SE winds.  Fingers crossed for some walleye gold! See you bright and early, Sunday morning."
