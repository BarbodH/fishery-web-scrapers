467980,beertech,2010-05-20 00:08:00,118,Have a merc motor that is oxidized and has water spots.  Anyone know of any cleaners waxes that will fix this up
467987,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-20 00:24:00,10439, The best thing I have found for removing water spots and the crud that builds up on the lower unit is CLR. For the cover I have a polisher and just use regular car polishing compounds and wax. I also use regular car wax on the lower unit after the CLR treatment.
