467752,lew,2010-05-19 11:38:00,12766,"I've been busy around the new house since moving in the beginning of March and now that the nice weather is here, I've been working outside most of the time. We planted a vegetable garden yesterday plus we've put in lots of flowers and a couple trees.    Best part of country living though, at least for me, is the quietness of the place. I've got a mile of bush right behind me and wander thru there most days just taking in the sights. Just me, the deer, turkey's and Mr. Bruin, although I haven't met him personally yet. Often hear the coyotes late and night or early morning too.    Most of the neighbors head south for the winter so it'll be even quieter when the snow flies.  We live near the end of a 12' wide dirt road so there's almost no traffic 'cept for a couple neighbors. Still strikes me as funny when someone just parks in the middle of the road and walks up for a visit. I worked outside for 3 hours yesterday and never saw a car go by and about the only sounds we hear are the birds chirping and the odd boat running up Clear Lake.  Then to top it all off, we were sitting on the front porch last evening and a couple go by in a horse & buggy, make a u-turn at the end of the road and head home again.  Ya gotta luv that      Reminded me of the good old days in Toronto when I was a kid and we had everything delivered to the house by horse drawn wagons"
467754,Jer,2010-05-19 11:46:00,1426,"The place is looking nice, Lew.  It seems ""Lew o'clock"" comes a lot later these days, must be the fresh air."
467755,corvette1,2010-05-19 11:52:00,1765,looks good lew you miss driving the 401 at rush hour ill bet
467756,BITEME,2010-05-19 11:54:00,1968,
467757,lew,2010-05-19 11:54:00,12766," I'm still always up around 3 A.M.Jer,  but these days I spend more time just reading the different boards rather than posting."
467761,TJQ,2010-05-19 12:12:00,7806,"Im happy for you Lew, its certainly well deserved."
467763,lew,2010-05-19 12:13:00,12766, I've had to go down to the city a couple times lately  and can feel my blood pressure rising by the time I get to Oshawa
467764,crappieperchhunter,2010-05-19 12:16:00,2582," Hope you got it fenced or I'm sure some of your ""new neighbors "" will be helping themselves   2foot high chicken wire will keep the rabbits out and give you a chance anyway.  Nice peaceful spot you got there Lew, I'm glad your enjoying it."
467775,Beans,2010-05-19 12:47:00,3339, I know how you feel Lew...  I'm that way just going to P'boro lately...  Mostly to see some specialist or sumpin' or to the hospital every three months for the urologist to take a look inside my bladder...You wouldn't believe how he does it unless you have been through the procedure...  The house looks great !
467776,Marty,2010-05-19 12:48:00,873,"I'm envious bud.   Place looks great and I'm sitting at my keyboard thinking ""Man, would that be nice."""
467783,solopaddler,2010-05-19 13:03:00,8605,"Sounds and looks perfect Lew, you're a lucky man."
467787,Tarzan's Jane,2010-05-19 13:12:00,1183,"You have what many could only wish for.  Your place looks so nice and I bet there is no other better smell than walking through the bush.  When it happens to me I'll turn to the person/people I am with and I'll ask them if they can smell that.  I ususally get - 'smell what'?  Sitting on my balcony last night I was enjoying watching a couple of ducks playing...going to be hard to give that up.  Enjoy your summer - nothing like fresh tomatoes, cucumbers heck fresh everything"
467788,Rattletrap2,2010-05-19 13:17:00,1652,"Place is looking real nice Lew!  Every day is an adventure, isn't it? I guess Marvin is enjoying all the new scents to sniff at as well? I'm sure he will enjoy it more than sniffing garbage."
467793,jimmer,2010-05-19 13:30:00,2730,"The best move you could have ever made Lew.  I did that 24 years ago at the age of 28.  Everyone said there was no way you could move to the country and survive.  Yes there were tough times, but I live on the lake and have paid off the house.  Life couldn't be better! Reading the replies from some of the other members that say your one of the lucky ones reminds me of all the naysayers. If anyone is desiring to live in the country, just DO IT, life is short.  Maybe I shouldn't say that, the population might increase around Lew; Sorry about that!"
467805,bigbuck,2010-05-19 14:26:00,2449,The house is looking prettier and prettier. Good job Lew!! Enjoy!!
467827,cityfisher,2010-05-19 15:50:00,959,very nice lew! piece of heaven !
467832,fishnsled,2010-05-19 15:57:00,3520,Very nice Lew.  Must be a real treat from the city life where the sounds of the traffic can drown out the sounds of the birds.  Nice to have it the other way around.
468091,Jer,2010-05-20 11:46:00,1426,"  I know exactly how you feel, Jimmer.  I did very much the same 14 years ago when I was 27. Although the house isn't quite paid for, it's close enough that there's light at the end of the tunnel.  Having grown up in Mississauga, this is paradise."
468118,Beans,2010-05-20 14:07:00,3339,Awe...Ya!  Nothing like country livin'...  I just came in from putting the run on the damn fox that kept me awake last night with it's catterwallering...Don't know if it was calling a mate or was after my cat...  Horrible sound...Sounds like a mix of a baby crying and a cat hacking up a furball...
468122,Joey,2010-05-20 14:45:00,9122,"That's just a little slice of heaven there Lew.  And as already pointed out, well deserved.  You'll have to give us a time delay photo essay of your vegetable garden  Joey"
468197,Gerritt,2010-05-20 19:48:00,6129,looking good Lew!  Is that Clear Lake across the road from you that I am seeing in the pics?
468210,Rich Clemens,2010-05-20 21:26:00,3131,Great to hear that Lew.  I can certainly see why you moved there.
468238,Twocoda,2010-05-20 23:09:00,4130,nice Lew ...well deserved im sure ...find the sunniest spot on the property and plant two apple trees.... tie a hammock to them and have a rest and a bite to eat
468401,Beans,2010-05-21 13:30:00,3339,  Careful...Bears likes apples...!
468409,lew,2010-05-21 13:44:00,12766,"Jeeeez, I forgot all about this post, and thanks again everyone for your comments  Yes Gerritt, that's Clear Lake & Twocota, I don't have any apple trees, but I've got a couple maples that are spaced perfectly for the hammock.  Norm, the trees are right beside the new up & coming garden so I sure hope Mr. Bruin doesn't like carrots or radishes"
