467740,lew,2010-05-19 09:53:00,12766," You definetely don't need an expensive rod like an Avid for trolling for muskies Vinnie and you can get way with far less. I use the Shimano Compres and their excellent, but many guys are even using the TDR's and are very happy with them for a fraction of the price."
467741,Roy,2010-05-19 10:02:00,13728,What's done is done but $120 sounds terribly expensive for a 209. Bullet proof winch for trolling though and Lew is right on with the rod advice.
467749,dave524,2010-05-19 11:13:00,4508," Same thought here. Used a few of them back in the late seventies when salmon fishing was taking off on various boats, believe the endplates were a red bakelite material back then, don't know if they been upgraded much over the years but for $120 you are close to a Garcia 7000 which I had on my boat, still got a couple, don't know of anyone still using their old 209's."
467750,Randy,2010-05-19 11:22:00,115,I still use my 209s for salmon fishing. Only thing I had done with them over the years was to replace the drag washers. I bought mine as a rod and reel combos for under $100 each over 10 years ago.
467765,irishfield,2010-05-19 12:18:00,26272, They sell for $55 new Roy... and the most I've ever paid is $23 on Ebay. I have 11 of them and use them for riggin for lakers.
467918,Uncle Buck,2010-05-19 20:38:00,1000,thier gear ratio is too small... takes forever to reel in...  otherwise good quality for a cheap $$ leadcore setup
467931,glen,2010-05-19 21:56:00,2641,The Penn 209 used to troll for muskie eh. If you use it every weekend it is a one year reel at best.  The small gear ratio is a pain.  Use an 8' or longer rod to help keep the line tight. The drag is also a pain.  A small movement on the drag and it goes from light to full drag.  However it does have enough drag power.  Usable reel yes.  Would i use it for trophy fish no.
467994,vinnimon,2010-05-20 00:39:00,2593,I paid $20 for it new at the store I was working at.And thanks for everyones replys.
468037,Carp,2010-05-20 02:15:00,1488,Two of the first salmon trolling reels I ever owned. Still use them more than 20 years later as spares. Never had an issue.
