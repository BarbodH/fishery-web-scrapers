468008,Terry,2010-05-20 01:17:00,14456,I'm looking for the free boat ramp on Sturgeon Bay around the corner form Waubaushene I think there is on could someone post or PM me as to where it is   if there is one  
468065,irishfield,2010-05-20 04:18:00,26272,"TTBOMK.. there is nothing in the bay.. but maybe Caswells Beach will let you put in. I haven't been there in a couple decades. Leah lived on SBay as a little kid.... and her Dad kept the place into the 80's. Daryl was conceived on that property..... lol  As far as I know there is still a public launch in Victoria Harbour though.. it's just a couple rock piles around the corner...  I will also add that Leahs' father faught the sewer plant in the courts and unfortunately lost.. it went in anyhow. Pump treated/untreated sewage into a bay, that at it's deepest spot is 8 feet. You USE to be able to water ski in Sturgeon Bay... now you can't even troll thru it thanks to the Phosperous and weed choke!"
468071,kenzy31,2010-05-20 04:58:00,261,"there's a pretty rough, exposed, public access at the end of Park St. / Robins Point Rd.  Just a short ride around Robins Point and you're in the bay.  Launch my boat there a few times a year as one of my close buddies lives on Sturgeon Bay.  when the wind picks up out of the West, some decent waves can crash in on ya.  makes re-loading a PITA!  the launch in town in Vic Harbour is decent, good luck.  looking forward to a report when you return"
468077,Terry,2010-05-20 09:12:00,14456,thanks for the info guys
468094,AzuluSpookd,2010-05-20 11:56:00,348,Leave your boat at home.  Go out with Andy.
468152,Terry,2010-05-20 16:31:00,14456, LOL  well if I want to catch fish that's the best way
468175,Harrison,2010-05-20 17:55:00,2202,"Hey Terry, I use the Victoria Harbour launch.  There is also a trailer park on the west sideof the bay I have used in the past as well."
468188,Terry,2010-05-20 18:46:00,14456,thanks guys   so I take it Victoria Harbour is Hogs bay?  where in Victoria Harbour is the free ramp....yeah I know I want a lot..LOL
468190,mikeh,2010-05-20 19:06:00,824,"the free launch is on Albert Street, What species are you targeting?"
468192,NAW,2010-05-20 19:12:00,4022,"Yep,  It's Hog Bay.  On Albert Street.  There's a vacant lot that people park in there."
468195,Terry,2010-05-20 19:30:00,14456,"thanks guys   walleye and pike  and if we can't find them, anything that will bite my hook"
