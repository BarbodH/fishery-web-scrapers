I don't leave the boat in the water longer then a weekend, don't tow with it too often, and it's main purpose was for protection while in my driveway.  I get about 3 years out of them and that is it.  My present one I bought at Walmart.  It seems to be a better fabric then the others I've had in the past.  Cheaper alternative then a custom one but I don't think you can beat a custom cover.  My next one will be a custom cover.  You may want to look at these guys as well.  Good Luck.  http://boatcovers.iboats.com/"
