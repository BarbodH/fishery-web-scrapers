468248,bushart,2010-05-21 00:08:00,2628,Pretty sure he left a callin card for Lew a week ago that was found whilst out walkin the dawg
468272,bassman,2010-05-21 01:23:00,384,I miss him and his humor. When does he get out of the penalty box?
468280,Gerritt,2010-05-21 01:52:00,6129,"I think it is a penalty box of his own choosing... best to leave sleeping ""dawgs"" lay... so to speak.. I am sure it is not the last we have seen of him..  G"
