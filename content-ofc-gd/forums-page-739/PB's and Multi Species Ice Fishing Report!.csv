423034,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-16 20:17:00,3761,"I went out with my buddy Rick (Gone Fishin) for a day perch fishing. I was going for perch and he was fishing for pike. Fishing from 9:30am to 2pm I caught my first fish through the ice and a PB Perch along with Rick getting his PB Northern Pike! A great 20minute fight this beast put out!  Had a great day!  A surprise Pike, my first pike/fish through the ice!   Now a 3lb Bowfin I caught up shallow while fishing for perch.   The best part is the Line snapped after this picture so I had to throw the camera and grab the fish quickly!  So, pike, bowfin..time for a Crappie now lol    Then the perch started to bite for me. I caught a average sized perch after the pike in the morning then came 2 12"" perch then a 13"" perch while I was on the phone lol...Pictures do not do the perch justice but for only catching 4 perch they were huge. The 13""er was a PB of mine by far  Perch #2   Perch #3   Perch #4   And the last photo of the day   Best ice fishing trip of mine so far!  Thanks, MTBF   O and here is a picture of Ricks Pike! This pike have him a great 20min fight. Wow, what a catch man. Congrads again on the PB! "

423196,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-17 12:23:00,3761," Lol to yourself and leechman. I thought I might of had a walleye on or well something else. Wasn't sure but I got a good look at it when it came to the hole...then it went for a run again. A good 5-8minute fight it gave me. There fun to catch but after I caught that and before I caught it no Perch were under the ice where i was fishing. I went out to see my buddy catch his PB...Came back after 20minuted to check my rods and had a 12"" perch on.  When they are around, nothing else is."
