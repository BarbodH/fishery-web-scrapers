423041,Terry,2010-01-16 20:47:00,14456,"just to let everyone know they are charging 10 bucks to park at Innisfil Beach Park and from 6am on, there was a long line up to pay I went else where, what can I say, I hate crowds and waiting in line  got out on the ice and set up fishfinder, camera and lure down the hole in 72 ft of water I could see whitefish swimming around but they would not touch my lure jigging it they would not even turn to look at it. It was like the lure wasn't even there  I tried to record the fish but my recorder for the camera just would not work today, turned out to be the battery  anyways I couldn't get them to bite so I moved out deeper  as soon as I put the fishfinder transducer in the hole I marked lots of fish minutes later after  3 bumps I had one on  I just got a look at it and off it went  I dropped the lure back down, the lure just hit the bottom and I had another one on this one was iced and was kept for dinner I had no real plans on keeping more but the next fish as I got it to the hole I could see the lure in it's mouth it bumped the ice and the second set of hooks went in it's eye it was bleeding like a ....never mind. I kept it  I put on a bigger lure and hoped to get a trout. but that didn't happen. I kept getting whitefish..oh well, I played them real slow and reached in the hole to release them. lost some from reeling slow  went 5 for 8 only the last one I got was snagged, the sure fight when they are, the rest of them had the lure in it's mouth  was a good day and the wife is happy. she has fish to eat life is good...LOL       so just for Lloyd I am not Terry"
423043,Cudz,2010-01-16 20:49:00,2652,Dinner.  Nice.  Bleeding like a vampire's mouth is what you meant correct? lol
423057,dagoat_1,2010-01-16 22:16:00,72,Sucks about the parking fee and line-up.  Glad you found alternate access and found the fish. We were at BBP and managed one whitie in the morning lost 2 others and then the bite stopped.  Did not even mark a fish except the odd laker (i think) that would rise from the bottom but would not commit.
423062,vinnimon,2010-01-16 22:26:00,2593,"We got to ibp and lucked for parking.One nice whitey between the three of us.Marked a few chasing baitfish and the odd laker was marked as well.I personally missed a good hit,twice actually!But nothing showed up on the aqua view.Oh well maybe next time."
