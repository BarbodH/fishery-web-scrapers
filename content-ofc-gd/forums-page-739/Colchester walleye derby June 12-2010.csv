For those looking for a great 1 day walleye event with very little cost, during an incredible time of fishing in the western basin of Lake Erie. The annual derby only cost $20 per entry and has a big fish top prize of $1500 paying 10 spots with 10th getting $100. After the derby there are numerous door prizes a beer tent and food. This event usually kicks off the season for walleye anglers in SW Ont. For those looking for a little bigger tourney the shoot is for you!    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I have been the front man for the Colchester Derby for the past 17 years. This Derby, as many of the members of this Board can attest, Is the largest best Derby in Ontario. We usually draw 550+ participants each year and pay out over $6000. in cash and prizes, with cash payouts to the top 10 anglers.  Like all derbys it is a 1 big fish derby. Anyone can win, so this is a big fun day for all entries.  For the last 3 years someone from a charter boat has won the derby. You know what happened, people started complaining that the playing field was not even.  We decided, to keep the integrity of the derby, we have agreed in principle to create the Colchester Shootout, a tournament within the derby.  We are going to allow 25 boats to enter The Shootout @ $210.00 per boat. We will payout 80% of the fees so the payout will be $4000.00 for a Winner Take All payday.  The date for the Derby and The Colchester Shootout will be 12 June 2010 at Colchester Harbour.  The applications will be posted on the Derby website on or about 15 April 2010.  The basic rules will be 4 walleye by length.  All boats must leave and return to Colchester Harbour and be subject to inspection.  No alcohol allowed in the Shootout, although it will be encouraged afterwards at the Kinsmen Tent.  A tie will be broken by the longest walleye of the four and if still tied it will be broken by the use a balance beam.
