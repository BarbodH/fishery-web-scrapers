423322,redneck666,2010-01-17 21:10:00,563," another question is, do you know of any other lakes up along the windmills and such? i got told last year that the windmill roads they made go into some ponds with decent specks, wether or not thats true..... who knows."
423324,Dara,2010-01-17 21:12:00,3052,  There is one nice little lake back there but I thinks its private. The snowmobile trail crosses a couple that I have seen holes drilled on..could be the same one. You gotta do some exploring
423326,redneck666,2010-01-17 21:16:00,563,"ya thats true, i've wasted some valuble gas so far drilling into what i thought were small lakes but turned out to be marshes haha!"
