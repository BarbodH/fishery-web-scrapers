423419,holdfast,2010-01-18 01:06:00,1813,I got out for a few hours on Saturday and not even a Bite.  I even fished the same hole as last weekend where I caught three pike.  Next week depending on the weather I may attempt a walk in lake that I fished in the summer.  I bought this holder from Walmarts which hopefully will do the trick.  a guy I bumped into suggested to put a long stick on the base to help it from tipping.     My portable ice shack.  Good if there isn't anymore snow.    These minnows were not nearly as frozen as the ones I was using last week.  They were easy to dig out.  Unfortunately I only used 3 of them    Yea I think next week Ill try another lake.
