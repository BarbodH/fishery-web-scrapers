423532,capt_hooked,2010-01-18 13:10:00,212,capt.hooked theorem: on any given fishing trip the total number of fish caught is inversely proportional to the number of beer that have been consumed. corollary: the success of a fishing trip is not necessarily based on either the number of fish that were caught or the number of beer consumed.

Some guys from down your way tried that this past weekend for a bonfire. The owner of the property caught them at it. Needless to say he wasn't too happy. Some charges were laid. These guys couldn't have known much about lighting a fire, green wood doesn't burn too well"
423667,Sandbag,2010-01-18 22:30:00,533,  Yeeesh...not too bright.  I am heading up to Nip in the morning for a couple of days..will post the results when I get back.  Cheers  Craig
