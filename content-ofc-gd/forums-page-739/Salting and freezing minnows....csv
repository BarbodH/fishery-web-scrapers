423252,The Urban Fisherman,2010-01-17 17:25:00,2050,I'm assuming you just dust them with salt and toss them into a ziploc then freeze 'em up but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask before I ruin a bunch of bait...  Thanks guys!  Ryan

423261,johnnyb,2010-01-17 17:43:00,3413,"Yep...the coarse salt is way better, and you have to drain the water that it extracts.  I throw mine in a margerine tub with salt, put it in the freezer, and drain it once a day.  After a couple days, there's no water left."

I place them on a large flat plastic tray in such a way that they don't touch each other and freeze them in the freezer.  30 minutes later, I put them into plastic bags, add a bit more salt and put them in the freezer downstairs.  They never stick together.  I have tried salted smelt against non salted smelt and it seems to me that the non-salted smelt produce more fish."
