Tried everything from 3 fow to 20, hard bottom, muddy bottom, weeds, no weeds, drop offs, lots of different presentations.  On my second hole I had a bite from a perch that was no bigger than my thumb (3 fow, lots of weeds), but he spit me at the hole.  Sadly, that's the closest we came to icing any fish all weekend.  I'll be out there again, as I'm sure I haven't exhausted the possibilities (not even close) yet.  On another note, I got a Humminbird 565 for Christmas and was trying to get it sorted out.  Couldn't.  I see guys using transducers made for boat mounting, but they have them attached to an old hockey stick or something.  Is this to get them to hang straight down?  Is this likely my issue?"

423568,GBW,2010-01-18 16:44:00,8460,make a T out of wood and screw the transducer on the l portion of the T.  Make the top of the T long enough so that it covers both sides of your hole.
