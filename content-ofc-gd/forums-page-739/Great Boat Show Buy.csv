I've been on the look out for a Mustang hydrostatic Inflatable PFD for myself for a while now. Well I found a smokin' buy today at the boat show.  Picked up the Mustang MD3153 for $230 at Inland Liferafts & Marine Ltd (416)207-0446  http://www.mustangsurvival.com/products/product.php?id=508  This particular vest retails between $320-340  Tomorrow, sunday, is the last day for this year's Toronto International Boat Show if anyone is interested.  Cheers, G."
