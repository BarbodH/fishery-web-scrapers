423446,Sinker,2010-01-18 02:04:00,8692,"I used to fish caribou out of Brooks cottages, but haven't been up for quite a few years. I think we were the first ones to ever rent one of thier cottages in the winter. Since then, they've winterized most of thier cabins, and even supply huts from what I hear.  Back in the day, the fishing was awesome. We used to haul lakers and eyes out of the same holes. My brother caught a 19lb pike once too!  There is a shoal, which I'm sure they will show you, to the west of the islands off the point. Find 60-70FOW and jig, you'll get fish there. I'm pretty sure they still stock the lake with eyes.  Are you sure the ice is good up there? I know caribou is the last lake in the area to freeze up safe.  S."
