423275,FisherMike,2010-01-17 18:42:00,108,im just wondering if anyone here has fished deer creek in simcoe.  ive heard that there is some decent fishing there and i wouldnt mind giving it a shot sometime.  a few buddies of mine ice fished it last year and got a couple crappie but that about all i know about it.  any info would be great. thanks

423292,FisherMike,2010-01-17 19:32:00,108,thanks for the info.  thats good to know.  i didnt think it would be a problem fishing in a conservation area though.  is it closed in the winter or something??
423296,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-17 19:57:00,2690,"Haven't contacted anyone in authority yet, but, drove by there yesterday and there were at least four parties ice fishing...the gates are closed and you are definitely fishing at your own risk, and, more than likely trespassing.  If you are concerned, try getting in contact with someone at long point conservation areas."
423352,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-01-17 22:14:00,1107,  Yes it is closed early fall and there are no trespassing signs by the dam but not sure if they are ment to keep people off the dam or out of the park completely suprised there were only 4 groups out with the ice on LPB getting to be unsafe thought there would be lots out today.
