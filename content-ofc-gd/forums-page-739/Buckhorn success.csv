423702,Dutch,2010-01-18 23:48:00,831,"Congrats!  Now, where are those crappies?"
423739,Michael_Brown,2010-01-19 01:33:00,411,"   I will take not around Mike B's ice hut for $500 Pat.    I personally think everyone is holding out on me. You people are just nailing huge crappies everywhere in the Kawartha's and nobody is saying anything. I mean these lakes are polluted with panfish. Especially with the water down two feet, they should just squirt up the hole when you drill a new one.  Somebody is going to slip up and when they do, I'll be all over them like white on rice (or chemong).  I'm suppose to film two upcoming TV segments for the new angling oppourtunities and the Bridgenorth Winter Panfish Festival and as of right now I'm going to try getting them to film on shore, maybe at Tim Hortons in Bridgenorth.    The panfish festival is shaping up nicely, a good idea has turned into a full-time volunteer job for my lovely wife (  ). She has done a great job and we are looking forward to a great day on the ice with lots of new and seasoned anglers with their families. Please join us on Feb. 13, 2010, it is a free event with proceeds being donated to the Peterborough United Way. Thank You to the members of this board who have offered to volunteer. We will be sending out update information in the next week or so.  http://www.clearvieworganizing.com/22.html"
