423070,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-16 22:59:00,3761,"Great job buddy, wow amazing pike!  I'm targeting pike again in 2 weeks but until then it's time for some perch and walleye fishing!  Great report and pictures! MTBF"
423071,Dozer,2010-01-16 23:00:00,896,Those smallies have freckles!  Nice fish for sure!
423078,The Urban Fisherman,2010-01-16 23:16:00,2050,"Man Im SO jealous that I can't target bass here!    I've got some wicked winter bass water that I have to avoid all the time while targeting panfish because the big largies always want to come out and play.  I realize you can't help what you catch, but I try to steer clear of those spots.   I'd be ALL over the winter bass action if it were legal here.  Thanks for the report!  Nice gator to!  Cheers, Ryan"
