423102,skeeter,2010-01-17 00:30:00,1907,i have an older model jiffy that i just picked up. does anyone know what the gas mixture is for them?
423105,walleyejack,2010-01-17 00:33:00,358,"mine is 9yrs old, i use 24:1"
423108,skeeter,2010-01-17 00:39:00,1907,thanks walleyejack i was guessing at 32:1 glad i asked...
423109,Terry,2010-01-17 00:50:00,14456,the best thing to do is buy synthetic motor oil like amsoil  and run it 50 to 1 or all the wayto 100 to 1 you motor will love it and no problems
423110,skeeter,2010-01-17 00:52:00,1907,wow that thin for an oldie? or is it because synthetic is that much better?   and thanks for the reply terry
423113,Terry,2010-01-17 00:56:00,14456,"because synthetic is that much better I was afraid to run it that high myself, all the stuff on the amsoil site said it was fine I first ran it 50 to 1 and now I run them about 80 to 1 and they run great  synthetic is that much better"
423114,skeeter,2010-01-17 00:58:00,1907,perfect i will try the 50:1 synthetic thanks  for the replies guy's
423240,Tybo,2010-01-17 16:37:00,1373,Terry. Isn't that A NEW auger in your white fish post.  12 years on the auger and just starter catching fish throw the ice last year. I have drilled ALOT of holes. Mix mine at 24:1 and only use castrol 2 stroke.
423249,Terry,2010-01-17 17:07:00,14456,"yup new , but doesn't run/work better then my old one"
423492,Vanselena,2010-01-18 04:04:00,269,I have a friend that is 90 year old and we were talking about this very subject on Friday. He said he only uses 10W30 motor oil and has never had any problems with any of his 2 strokes. I was shocked at first but then could only comment that obviously using 10W30 has stood the test of time.
423494,redneck666,2010-01-18 04:13:00,563,i use 50:1 in my sleds.... one is a 1981 and the other is a 1992. they both run fantastic! all though terry's suggestions sounds pretty good too.
423504,cityfisher,2010-01-18 05:06:00,959,Not sure anout jiffy but my new strikemaster auger says in bold red letters Do Not use syn oil!! And asks for 40 -1 ratio
423510,troutologist,2010-01-18 05:29:00,951,Most guys I talk to in the older Jiffys run Opti 2....the little package in 1gal of gas = 80:1. Been fine in mine and others successfully use this as well.
423515,johndox,2010-01-18 06:52:00,54,A friend has an old Jiffy and he mixes his 24:1. Think the new ones are 40:1. Check the website they might have details
423531,skeeter,2010-01-18 13:06:00,1907,"checking jiffy's web site was the first thing i did. they only show there newer model they dont have any info on the older ones at all..  thats why i asked cause i knew i would get the right answers here. and if Terry says it, thats good enough for me how can i argue with him? he took my advise when he asked about atv or sled awhile back. btw terry my ski-doo is in the shop having the engine rebuilt for the SECOND time.... long story but the guy that did it the first time no longer works there ---too many mistakes!!!"
423533,skeeter,2010-01-18 13:11:00,1907,"i was just thinking!!! ( yes some times i do that) Terry hows your sled running?  was my advise good or could this be ""Terry's revenge""  LOL just kidding , i know you would steer anyone wrong  thanks for all the advise from every one"
423576,Terry,2010-01-18 17:15:00,14456,"LOL my sled is running fine thanks..LOL  I checked and double checked. Jiffy's site didn't help, but other sites said it would be fine and that amsoil at 100 to 1 had more lubricating properties then 20 to 1 regular oil  ran it in the old one for a few years"
