I will be going through google to find out what and where, however I figured I'd ask the expersts.  At this time of year, what should I be doing / going to catch any fish?  Thanks for the input."
423254,Fisherman,2010-01-17 17:32:00,7201,"Go to Metro or Provigo..   not quite sure when the tommy cod run is at St Anne de la Perade, give it a google, you can have some fun there."
423258,Roy,2010-01-17 17:40:00,13728,You can try THIS place. It'll be different. It's a party more than it is fishing but you'll come away with lots of tommycod...decent eating too.

423267,Fisherman,2010-01-17 18:11:00,7201," I was using a quick response rig, ya did one of those places back around 1974-5, went there with our whole shift of 20 guys, we had a hoot to say the least and a pile of little tommies."
423283,Gerritt,2010-01-17 19:07:00,6129,that place looks fun!
423293,Dabluz,2010-01-17 19:33:00,701,"I live about 3 hours north of Quebec City and on the fishing forums from around Quebec City, not many go for tommy cod.  It's quite expensive.  I would go there only for a couple of hours with the kids.  There are lots of places on the St-Lawrence for walleye, pike, perch etc.  Go to this forum:  It's a french speaking forum but I'm sure that you will get some great answers from the guys I know.  I'm almost certain that you will even get invitations to go fishing with some of the guys.  You will have to join the forum to post a question but that's easy to do.  My name on the forum is ""Phern"".  If you want translation help, I will be looking out for your questions and I will translate.  http://www.pecheenville.com/Forum/index.php"
