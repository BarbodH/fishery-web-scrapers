So what I'm asking is, does anybody know where I can get my nils head sharpened (need to be certified from nils, a normal sharpen will make it worse), or where I can buy another head? Failing that, does anybody know a place which carries Nils Master Augers..? (Within Canada that is)  I contacted Nils, and they sent me a link to cabelas us, but I didnt really want to pay shipping/fees from the states etc.  Its crazy that I cant locate anybody who has these, after using it I will do whatever it takes to get my hands on another..  thanks in advance!"
