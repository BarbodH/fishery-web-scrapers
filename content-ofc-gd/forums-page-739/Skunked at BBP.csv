423339,Skud,2010-01-17 21:48:00,739,I was on the ice with my Bro-in-law from 7:30am till noon. Many fish came up to have a look at our lures but I only had one hit on a jigging Shadrap around 11:30 which I promptly lost after a 5 second fight. Lots of people everywhere. I seen only a few fish iced.  May try again tomorrow afternoon.
423342,BillM,2010-01-17 21:54:00,17367,I've never walked so much in my entire life like I did today out on the lake.  Slow is an understatement.  However we did stop at the end of the day and nail a bunch of jumbos
423350,richyb,2010-01-17 22:11:00,774,I was out on simcoe today also. Had about 30 mins of decent action and then it went dead. Didnt see many fish landed and people were moving alot.
423368,12footspringbok,2010-01-17 22:48:00,459,Ya its weird out there some days. Didn't get a single hit till they turned on at 12 yesterday. Today went with three buddies and were heading back in with our limit of whities at 9 with a couple more released and many lost.
423382,BillM,2010-01-17 23:20:00,17367,  LOL!!  Guess I was fishing all the wrong spots today   Glad you guys made out good.
423403,Skud,2010-01-18 00:04:00,739,Same here. We moved around to several spots also. 105 fow up to 85 fow. Tried lots of different lures too.
423404,BillM,2010-01-18 00:09:00,17367," We couldn't find a decent concentration of fish.  The odd blip on the graph and that was about it...  Ah well, what can ya do!!!  I need to get some aluminum ramps for the truck so I can quit walking and start riding the ATV..."
423418,maksuttt,2010-01-18 01:02:00,21,"Hey Doug, The bite was tough today - true... Managed only 3 lakers. All in 100'+, lost a few... See you on the ic:) Max"
423423,Rob,2010-01-18 01:11:00,467,"I couldn't get a whitie if I shot one. I got one laker, tons of lookers and no whities. My buddy fishing 2oo' away nailed 4 whities in less time out there than me and was using the exact same lure. Oh well guess that's why it's called fishing and not catching!  Rob C"
423468,Bondar,2010-01-18 03:02:00,817,heres a couple from yesterday       80' of water   dont wait for fish to come to you Move move and after that move again
423525,Spiel,2010-01-18 12:26:00,9065, Now this sounds more like the Doug I know.
423546,Skud,2010-01-18 14:31:00,739," It certainly does unfortunately. I'm surprised I still enjoy fishing after all these years of sucking at it. I guess I'd rather sit and do nothing but stare at Mother nature than the TV.   Max, I did see you walking about looking for a better spot to fish. I should have followed after you."
423585,maksuttt,2010-01-18 17:58:00,21,Next time   See you on the ice!
