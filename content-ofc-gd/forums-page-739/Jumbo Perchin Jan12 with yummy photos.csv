422729,Mako,2010-01-15 22:20:00,25,"Date: Jan 12th 2010 Location: Belleville Area Ice thickness: 12 inches Time: 7:30am-11:30am Lures: Jigging Raps & Swedish Pimples with minnow chunks  I headed out Tuesday morning with my buddy, Jean Marc, to track down some jumbos. We fished the same spot I had gone to a week before.  The first drop in the hole and we got a perch. Always a good sign.  So we set up the hut here and were able to do really well for the first hour and half, but by 10am everything slowed down. We left the warmth of the hut and popped a few more holes but the fish seemed to have shut down.  In the end we landed around 40 fish, and I brought 8 home to cook up.  The meal I wanted to do was Tempura Perch with Rice and a Lemon Ginger sauce. I also wanted to take some photos of the plate in my white box, which is a setup I have for doing product shots.  I have never done tempura before but it turned out quite well and as the recipe stated, if done right it wouldn't be oily at all.  Also included are some shots from last Sunday when we headed out for walleyes at Mass. Pt but unfortunately they were not cooperating that day....although I did get a nice sunrise photo.

Presentation is simply awesome!....nothing wrong with being creative....keep watching the food shows...and keep posting those piccies   INSPIRATIONAL...looks delicious!"
423248,Mako,2010-01-17 17:07:00,25,"Thanks for the feedback.  This was the first time shooting food and I felt rushed since I had to take the shots and run back up and continue cooking the rest of the fish.  Once you add the club soda & egg to the dry ingredients you have to fry with it right away to keep the batter bubbly, which in turn creates a great crust.  Aron"
