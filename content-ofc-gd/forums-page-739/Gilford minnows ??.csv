421684,FISHINGNUT,2010-01-12 23:37:00,253,Heading to Gilford on Sat to Petes huts to be exact and it seems he doesnt carry minnows  any more so I was wondering if any one knows if I can buy them in the area there. I have never been there and dont know what is there? I am driving in from Waterloo I really dont want to be out all day with my 9 year old and not have minnows.
421687,Dondorfish,2010-01-12 23:49:00,1000,Corner of 89 and younge st ( #11) - on the right as you come up 89.  Don

421743,johnnyb,2010-01-13 01:52:00,3413,What those guys said   Keith at the corner of 89 and Yonge has the best minnows around...plus lots of goodies on the wall
421877,Governator,2010-01-13 15:16:00,879,"Peter supplies minnows for you, no worries (I was in his huts Sunday)"
422042,FISHINGNUT,2010-01-13 22:35:00,253,Thanks for the info guys.Pete told me via email Sunday he had no minnows   for 10 bucks I will pick some up anyways  just in case before getting there.If he has them again by Saturday thats ok you can never have enough salties .My kid is convinced for some reason that you have to have some sort of live bait when we go fishing plus the minnows usually keep him amused for at least a while
423228,fishboy,2010-01-17 15:29:00,550,"  We always stop there-quality bait and decent scoop size.  For whatever reason, this guy and that Peter guy do not see eye to eye...."
