754374,landry,2012-12-25 14:57:00,1005,Was wondering if anyone has fished this lake for lakers or ice fished it. I am heading there this winter for some ice fishing. Thanks Landry

754393,bigbuckzone,2012-12-25 17:41:00,7,"I've fished that lake quite a bit in the last couple years. Theres plenty of trout in there, but don't expect anything bigger than 3 pounds. I hug the shore along the south side of the lake in 50' to 65' of water. If you wana catch a big one try fishing on Salmon lake"
754395,Joeytier,2012-12-25 18:00:00,3990,"It's small and wall to wall with cottages, but it gets stocked every year so obviously there will be some little guys around at least"
754424,fishindevil,2012-12-26 00:05:00,6254,That lake has a slot as well and only one line through the ice as well !!! Please read the regs before you go !!!
754438,bigbuckzone,2012-12-26 03:35:00,7,"Yes I should have mentioned that, it only applies to Salmon lake though, Fortescue is fair game for trout, open all year with no slot or line restriction. I usually fish Fortescue in the morning just as a ""warm up"", then head over to Salmon for the bigguns. Fortescue may be worth it this year if the little dinks from 2 years ago managed to survive. I havent had a look at the charts but I think they stock about 1000 yearly"
754446,landry,2012-12-26 05:55:00,1005,Thanks for the great feedback and tips guys. I am going in march. Will be a great time. Landry]
754491,Squid,2012-12-26 19:19:00,1656,Does anyone know of a boat launch on Fortescue?
754607,ecmilley,2012-12-27 15:55:00,2163,"off a white lake road, not much of one but that's the access"
754611,stendec,2012-12-27 16:12:00,22,"      Terry, What app for google maps is that? I have never seen anything like it."
754612,Christopheraaron,2012-12-27 16:21:00,3525, Fish ON Line
754614,Terry,2012-12-27 16:25:00,14456,good website to check out lakes  http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_online/fishing/fishingExplorer_en.html
754689,stendec,2012-12-27 22:36:00,22,"Thanks guys, that helps a lot! cheers!"
754738,singingdog,2012-12-28 11:55:00,1047, As long as you don't care much about accuracy   The info about species is rarely correct for the lakes that I fish.
754742,fishindevil,2012-12-28 12:41:00,6254,Yes that's true one of my lakes I fish in Haliburton for bass says there is no pike and well we catch several every year.... So it's def not 100% that's for sure ... I thinks it's just a general info that's all for more info its always best to call local boat shops or the local guys usually know best
