Our family settled into a new home and I settled into a new job. Outdoor exploration in unfamiliar surroundings was plentiful!  Following some winter Steelheading, I hiked the upper stretches of local creeks before opener to take some pics of spawning fish and to see how healthy the run was.           Once opener arrived 95% of the fish were gone. While fishing for Carp and Channel Cats in June I was shocked to get this one.         A few Carp were captured on the fly as well. This has become one of my favorite types of angling over the last 3 years.       Most years I leave the Salmon alone once they enter the rivers. I needed to scratch the itch before Steelhead season so I couldn't resist. When they first enter in the lower stretches, they sure do love flies!         Now that the temps have cooled down nicely, Steelie fishing has been awesome! 2012 is the year of the bead for me. Never really gave them the respect they deserve before.                   Hope everyone has a great holiday! 2013...Bring it."
