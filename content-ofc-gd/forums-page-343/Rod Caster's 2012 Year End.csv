754174,4x4bassin,2012-12-24 15:41:00,1025,"Good year for you , thanks for the recap ! Your picture with the buried truck is my kind of fishing , it looks to be in there pretty good . How did you get it out of that mess ?"
754177,Rod Caster,2012-12-24 15:50:00,5784,"I tried for 4 hours to get out with whatever nature had nearby and my dinky jack. When all that failed and I had no energy left, I called for Off-Road recovery and they got me out in 5 minutes haha  This poor truck has seen so much terrain and abuse, but it gets me to some nice quiet lakes!"
754206,adolson,2012-12-24 17:50:00,783," Yep, the laker lake. You can tell by the tree line that it's the same lake, and in this pic you can just see the back of the little guy breaking the surface as well as my bottom-bouncer:    I think we only went to our walleye lake once with Joeytier all of this year, unless I'm not remembering right.  As for lakes around here, I dunno. A couple weeks ago I saw some crazy guys at a splake lake standing on the edge of the ice, near a current and open water... So I'm guessing by now it's probably fine for sane people.  I haven't gotten out yet, though.. I'm exhausted. But oh do I ever want a nice trout through the ice!"

753338,Acountdeleted,2012-12-20 04:55:00,2562,Awesome review. Looks like you had a good year..... was that one unknown fish a lamprey?
753340,Nipfisher,2012-12-20 05:52:00,2449,Good job buddy. Needed you out there with us today. I hope to be in alot more picture with you in 2013 (if we ever make it).
753360,LucG,2012-12-20 13:11:00,779,"A good year for sure! Not everyone can line up pics like those ones.  Nice canoe, she is a beaut!  ...especially when atop a truck buried in mud. Lol  Looking forward to getting out again."
753373,Lip-ripper,2012-12-20 14:10:00,228,Well done! Looks like it was a terrific year for you. I'd like to hammer some of those ling this year if you feel up to it. The pic of the wife sitting in the canoe on the ice is classic! she doesn't look to impressed...
753374,torco,2012-12-20 14:22:00,656,"Great report, looks like a great year!"
753382,NAW,2012-12-20 15:11:00,4022,Great season Chad!  Nice report for sure.  I like Stash Tony's fish he drawing in Blair's hut.  That was a G@ for the memory books for sure.
753395,wormdunker,2012-12-20 16:39:00,1711,Nice job Chad.  Love the wally pix!
753488,Rod Caster,2012-12-20 22:38:00,5784," You got that right. I have many brookie spots in mind.   You know it Rick! Someday I'll take you up on that offer.   Hahahaha. Does that mean I would have to listen to Skrillex too?   Once Nip locks up, we'll be hooking up more often for sure.   hahaha. ..that means I must have captured the moment! I had to remind her that canoes float.   Yes, that was a great meeting. I'm glad I took a  lot of photos.      Thanks for all comments!  "
753520,trapshooter,2012-12-21 00:29:00,1234,Great year for sure.  The fact you went fishing on your honeymoon says a lot!!  Lucky dude!
753543,Moosebunk,2012-12-21 02:08:00,3970,"1.  Stellar year for ya RC.  Great mixed bag but do love the walleye slaying going on.  And them ling!!!  2.  Didn't realize it, but this post clearly identified we at OFC have quite the North Bay group of anglers here.  Cool!"
753559,Nipfisher,2012-12-21 05:17:00,2449,"  Andrew, between here and Sturgeon Falls we must have 20 OFC members. Nice that a few of us fish together regularly too."

754120,adolson,2012-12-24 04:49:00,783,"That pic of me was not looking for a walleye, that was me losing that little pike - along with your Rapala!"
754172,Rod Caster,2012-12-24 15:23:00,5784," Not the one while we were laker fishing, was it?  I thought this was from our top secret walleye lake... I might be wrong however.  The lakes must be locked up pretty good in your neck of the woods by now? Lets make plans"
