754458,limeyangler,2012-12-26 14:23:00,5204,"Hi all,  -30C last night, went to start truck and it would not go. Was plugged in all night. Battery seems fine its just like there is no 'spark' or something.....turn the key and you get the same sound as usual.....it just wont kick in and start. Any ideas?"
754459,Roy,2012-12-26 14:26:00,13728,Frozen gas line?
754460,4x4bassin,2012-12-26 14:27:00,1025,"Did you try some gas line antifreeze Simon , maybe you picked up a bad tank of gas somewhere !"
754461,BillM,2012-12-26 14:31:00,17367,"Spray some starter fluid through the TB, if it starts (Or at least stumbles), you've got a fuel issue."
754462,limeyangler,2012-12-26 14:32:00,5204,    Thanks guys....why didn't i think of that. Can i use the same stuff as i use for my skidoo?
754469,misfish,2012-12-26 15:14:00,29133,Do you hear the fuel pump Simon when you turn the key? I always fill up with petro Can. Never had an issue.
754472,limeyangler,2012-12-26 15:32:00,5204, Did not hear that Brian....but even without the anti freeze the truck started an hour later???????  WEIRD!
754474,misfish,2012-12-26 15:48:00,29133," The pump MAYBE your prob. Not work,then work. I went through that. Just a thought. FYI If you can,always try to keep the tank full during the winter."
754519,skeeter,2012-12-26 22:54:00,1907,As a starting aid you can use WD40. It does not strip oil off the cylinder walls like either does. Yes it does work great. I have used that method for years.
754524,Rich Clemens,2012-12-26 23:23:00,3131," Exactly what happened to us Christmas Eve (am).  Works once, then not, then works, then it works no more.  Replaced fuel pump and starts right up now.  This was on a 2000 Taurus."
754549,Muskieman,2012-12-27 02:14:00,2472,"It's happened to us in all models we've owned ... FUEL FILTER  was the culprit , from Ford to Honda to VW and back again , FF was the culprit , just not letting enough fuel through during initial startup. ."
