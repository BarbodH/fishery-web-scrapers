After a few years , I seen it , a vintage 1985 or so Berkley Lightning Rod brand new in the bag ...  Anyway he gave it to me last night , gonna make a fine addition to my Man Cave decor . Never used never will be ... I'm a Lightning Rod fan , the first expensive rod I ever bought was a Lightning just like this one . I was 14 and paid over 100$.  http://s1275.photobucket.com/albums/y444/Mallarduck/?action=view&current=69B0F002-1937-4E4C-8B6C-A85D479A4449-4512-00000146B9353863_zps61b3e390.mp4"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i1275.photobucket.com/albums/y444/Mallarduck/69B0F002-1937-4E4C-8B6C-A85D479A4449-4512-00000146B9353863_zps61b3e390.mp4"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket Pictures, Images and Photos"" /></a>  Randy "

754211,Fisherman,2012-12-24 18:25:00,7201,"The parents of Lightning Rod must have been pretty prolific, I have the triplet with the $59.97 tag still on it, bought it at a Kmart in Yorkville Sk.  Last one on the shelf about 25 years ago.  And no, not for sale."
754216,irishfield,2012-12-24 18:39:00,26272,"I still use my 6'6"" as a daily fishing rod... purchased at LB's on Dundas... 1983! Have never found anything better... well until Spiel made a couple custom rods for the family.. but of course he put other peoples names on them so I'm not allowed to use them!"
