753695,Guest,2012-12-21 20:56:00,0,  Ya a little.  Once you get a head of a 20+ pounder following your lure to the boat it becomes an obsession lol.
753700,captpierre,2012-12-21 21:15:00,2521,"You don't have to preach to the converted.  Many of us are trapped in the musky addiction and are needing therapy.  It costs us thousands every year.  Stresses our marriages.  Almost as frustrating as that 4 letter word, golf"
