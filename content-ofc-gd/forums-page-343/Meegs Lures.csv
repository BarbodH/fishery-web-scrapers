754220,Terry,2012-12-24 18:57:00,14456,"I am looking for them, not all the knock offs that are out there does anyone know where to get them"
754257,Spiel,2012-12-24 20:48:00,9065,"Have you tried PM'ing ""Meegs?"""
754259,Terry,2012-12-24 21:05:00,14456, dang that might work....lol
754261,Roy,2012-12-24 21:13:00,13728,Eggnog must be more potent this year.  Good stuff Terry. It's good when we can encourage one of our own.
754262,adempsey,2012-12-24 21:14:00,1498,"Here is the contact information I have.  edit: I wasn't able to post the website and email.  416-850-4560  The website doesn't seem to be operational any longer though.  If you can't find them, I think the Magz Bad Boys are just as good."
754269,Terry,2012-12-24 21:29:00,14456,"thanks  yeah, jigs is a dead website but it was ran by someone else, who by the way was also a member here at one time.  A guy I met on the river today who was looking to buy some meegs lures...he recognized me from this website he reads it all the time but does not post, hi Mauro"
754281,irishfield,2012-12-24 21:59:00,26272,"Next time you're fishing with Andy.. just steal some out of his box!! LOL James is a good lad... his ""seller"" .. ie meegs on line didn't do him any justice.. just sayin.  Great to see you help a guy advertise his product though Terry!"
754286,misfish,2012-12-24 22:04:00,29133," I do believe,Meegs was the original was it not? just saying.  Ya pm James. He,ll get back to you."
754288,Terry,2012-12-24 22:08:00,14456, yeah I think he was first and all the others are a knock offs... I will PM him
754289,irishfield,2012-12-24 22:23:00,26272,Yep.. James made them and the masses followed. Brian you know whom I was referring to... that was selling James product. His name is still in the word filter for many many reasons!
754291,Terry,2012-12-24 22:29:00,14456, we all remember John
754316,Handlebarz,2012-12-25 02:00:00,3790,But you can still say musky John
754356,Meegs,2012-12-25 12:28:00,249,"Yes, still trying to forget that name myself.  Send me a pm terry, im sure I can help you out. Dont really make them in the masses any more, just no time with work/kids, and id rather be fishing myself with my time off, but I still make a batch or two every year"
754357,Terry,2012-12-25 12:32:00,14456,thanks
754377,glen,2012-12-25 15:39:00,2641,Great lures.  Merry Christmas Meegs.

754380,Meegs,2012-12-25 16:00:00,249,"Thanks guys, hope everyone has a fantastic holiday"
754382,Chuck Best,2012-12-25 16:07:00,308,"Merry X-Mas to all and don't forget James,I've got lead o' plenty for you......(couple buckets anyways...)..TC all and tight lines.....Chuck......"
754425,Sinker,2012-12-26 00:24:00,8692,"I happen to have a mold and lead to make a batch. What hooks and paint should I use? I find the meegs do work the best, and. I've tried them all. I find shoal diggers are the toughest, but don't work quite as well as the original Meegs jigs!!"
754457,Meegs,2012-12-26 12:40:00,249,"Order hooks from luremaking.com, I like the mustad ultrapoint, best hook for the price.   I use automotive air brush paint and seal it with epoxy"
754478,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-26 17:40:00,10439, Then if you want them bullet proof cover with Soft Tex. You can get it at Bass Pro.  
754567,Sinker,2012-12-27 04:53:00,8692,Thanks for the info guys. I'll giver a whirl and see how they turn out. I find some of the lead is much softer than others. Do you have a preference? The stuff I'm using is in sheets that were used to line the walls of an xray room. I'd say its pretty pure lead. Would wheel weights be harder?  S.
754568,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-27 06:17:00,10439,The wheel weights would be harder. I believe they add tin to the lead to harden it up. You could add some of your sheet material to the wheel weights to cut down on the amount of wheel weights you need.
754570,wormdunker,2012-12-27 08:07:00,1711,"Please post a pic, I'd like to see the Meegs."
754593,ecmilley,2012-12-27 14:37:00,2163,"Sinker you want wheel weight lead come and get it, have 10-12 lbs in a bucket"
