I have to go get my bandages removed, stitches out and my new pacemaker regulated tomorrow afternoon...   Even afterwards I'm not to lift my left arm above my shoulder and no heavy lifting or work for another 6 to 8 weeks...  I should get my driving privileges back tomorrow then I will drive the truck back and forth over the driveway to pack the snow down to save throwing up gravel with the snowblower...   "
