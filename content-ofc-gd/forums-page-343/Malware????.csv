754361,aplumma,2012-12-25 14:00:00,6896,The thread was scanned and it comes up clean. A ticket was submitted to the server and the thread was removed to be safe. We would rather be safe than sorry here. If anyone ever has any possible issues feel free to send a P.M. to the Mod of their choice and we would be happy to help.  Merry Christmas  Art
