747205,jedimaster,2012-11-27 19:31:00,3472,Just as a heads up I got my 5x dsi that I ordered friday delivered yesterday. its all put together and waiting for the hard water.
747240,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-27 21:25:00,10439, NICE!!!
747246,jedimaster,2012-11-27 21:40:00,3472,"Yep, ordered friday, delivered monday. Great service thus far and awesome deal. I think I am going to not use the D cell battery layout and instead rig up a 10 amp UPS battery, I think I'll make a little insulated box for it to help try and increase battery life."
747249,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-27 21:44:00,10439, Not sure what the battery pack is like in this unit but I have been able to remove them or cut them out in other units and use 7-9 mah gel UPS type batteries in my other similar portables.
747298,livinisfishin,2012-11-27 23:07:00,661,Nothin in the mail for me...
747310,super dave,2012-11-27 23:57:00,323,"Got mine today too.  What's more amazing is that my wife didn't give me grief for another ""useless fishing product""."
747338,livinisfishin,2012-11-28 01:20:00,661,Do they send you an email saying they have been shipped?
747343,Marko,2012-11-28 01:31:00,854,"I got mine today.  I got a conformation email from them telling me that my order had been shipped,along with the order number."
747345,livinisfishin,2012-11-28 01:37:00,661,"The only email ive gotten so far is the ""order process"" one.  Maybe tomorrow lol"
747601,northernpike56,2012-11-28 22:56:00,717,I bought one from that site as well now. thanks for posting it.  
747605,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-28 23:02:00,10439,Still waiting for mine but it does take longer to get here. Canada Post has to transfer it to the dog sled at the NWT border and then to birch bark canoe for the trip across the  McKenzie River only to be transferred yet again to another dog sled for the final leg of the trip to Yellerknife.
747626,hotsky,2012-11-29 00:06:00,400,I just checked out some reviews on that portable Lawrence fishfinder and the 3 I found at Cabelas side are negative. but they paid $250 for it. Anyone actually used one before are they any good?  Optimal speed is 14km/h would it still work on my inflatable cruising around with my 30lb trolling motor on a low speed? Don't want to waste money on something I cant use.
754429,ctdd2006,2012-12-26 01:45:00,531,Just got one for xmas.  Can one buy or does one need an ice ducer?  I want to primarily use on ice.  Thanks. Ps.  If so any suggestions as which one and where to buy?
754430,kickingfrog,2012-12-26 02:00:00,8333,"No, an Ice transducer is not necessary."
746068,MCTFisher9120,2012-11-23 21:18:00,3761,I think Gagnons might be doing a cyber monday too...details still to come
746076,Marko,2012-11-23 21:31:00,854,"Thanks for the link for the fish finder. I have been looking for one for a while now...awesome deal, just ordered one."
746105,Rustic-Fisher,2012-11-23 23:08:00,826,Sierratradingpost.com Some good deals today.
746122,GBW,2012-11-23 23:53:00,8460,you know you are talking about Gougers um I mean Gagnon's right?!?!?!  They don't care about squat unless you are spending thousands there yearly.  Mike is the ONLY nice person there and he's almost never out front!
746144,super dave,2012-11-24 00:46:00,323,I just ordered online as well.  Did u guys get a confirmation number?
746148,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-24 00:54:00,10439, Nope.
746151,Acountdeleted,2012-11-24 01:12:00,2562,Rumor has it (for the obstacle course folk in our group) That warriordash.com will be selling tickets to any race in 2013 for $35 on Cyber monday. I have yet to see proof on the site but my buddy who told me this is a pretty reliable source.
746154,super dave,2012-11-24 01:17:00,323,"If you go to ""my account"" details are there. Confirmation is also emailed.  Can't wait!!! Thanks trouty"
746162,Cosmos,2012-11-24 01:46:00,588,Thank you man. Just ordered one. Awesome deal.
746173,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-24 02:28:00,10439, Thanks!!! Seems it didn't go through the first time.
746187,Marko,2012-11-24 03:27:00,854, My confirmation was in my hotmail junk folder. Check that before panicking haha
746193,Lip-ripper,2012-11-24 04:17:00,228,Wow! I guess it was a terrific deal after all! Glad I was able to help you guys out. Here's hoping your new toys help put some trophy fish in your hands!
746227,MCTFisher9120,2012-11-24 14:18:00,3761," Sundays guys  The gougers are up the street remember that  Well and the noobs that run the place. On a positive note we have lot's of ice gear set up so far and am still waiting on more to come in from Clam, Strike Master, Jiffy, etc...Jigging Raps were done and priced down last week. Stop in, there is new gear coming through every week. I did the Abu Garcia/Fenwick spring order not to long ago.  Tightlines this holiday season everybody. MTBF  And don't use the word ""they"" there is a great crowd of experience anglers and hunters that work at the shop and I would fish with any of them and have. I see countless people leave happy, from tying nots to showing a texas rig every day i witness the good in our store....And that's why we offer service that no BPS or Sail could. All the time I am filing special orders, dealing with guys rods and reels etc.  When I'm on the floor I try to run from next person to next person when things are busy but park ass behind the counter when I'm not plugging away in the back. The Christmas sale is coming up, Nov 29th-Dec9th...be prepared to save money on some great gear...I've answered some emails here regarding tackle and equipment..don't be shy to send a PM."
746326,GBW,2012-11-24 22:10:00,8460,"Mike I know you mean well, after all 'they' do help pay your bills.  but the fact still stands that for MANY years (inc. now) 'they' have been over priced.  And I'm not talking against a big box store, just check Lebaron's prices and even though they are high too they are still better.  The owners of the store should learn from past mistakes they and others have made and try to adjust and improve.  Customer SERVICE & PRICE keeps people going into the store, not 1 person who works there.  Maybe I'll go see who's working at SAIL tomorrow just for fun..."
746383,SirCranksalot,2012-11-25 00:33:00,3291,What does 'portable' mean when applied to fish finders? The FF posted above seems to require a 12V battery. I though 'portable' meant it would run on dry cells such as AA's.
746396,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-25 01:22:00,10439, If you're talking about the Mark 5 DSI portable it runs on 8 D cells. Happy? I remove the battery holders and use a 7 AH 12 volt gel cell. Better battery life and the ability to recharge.
746400,GBW,2012-11-25 01:39:00,8460,The Q  The A  Also A.2.  Portable for a FF also means that it is not fixed to a boat or other such item where it must be mounted.  Portable doesn't mean 'light' by any means.  Just that you can move it.  Help a bit?
746501,Jer,2012-11-25 14:51:00,1426,"  I hafta disagree with you somewhat, Geoff. I've bought quite a few things at Gagnon's over the last few years and have always found them to be fairly priced.  A new Compre rod this past summer was $20 less than at Sail. An Ice Armour suit a few years ago was $30 less than Bass Pro, with a much better selection. A Stradic and a Citica last year at blow out prices, $115 & $89 respectively. Just a few I can think of right now.  I've been through the Sail store a few times and have yet to buy anything more than some plastics and some hooks.  I do agree that service can be somewhat lacking (of course I've never had the pleasure of being served by Mike) but I find that pretyy much everywhere I go, Lebarons and BPS are usually much worse. The service at Sail isn't bad, but there are no customers so it's easy for them.  If I feel the need to chat with someone in a store, I just go see Frank at Bridgenorth Sports."
746529,registerfly,2012-11-25 15:48:00,198," portable WRT FF means no size 27 battery to lug around, so yes to the 12 v little guys and in the case of the Lowrance dry cells if you must but PITA really."
746530,GBW,2012-11-25 15:52:00,8460,"Just an example for you Jer. @ Al Flaherty's outdoor store Streamside Float Rod 10.5ft, 2 Piece, Sliding Rings #FL1052 @ $58.50 ea  @ Gagnon's Streamside Float Rod 10.5ft, 2 Piece, Sliding Rings #FL1052 @ $69.99 ea  *edit to add* these prices are not sale prices but normal prices."
746532,registerfly,2012-11-25 15:58:00,198,"   Gagnon is ONLY ok if you are local, can plan to purchase many items on sale at the same time to make it worth the 1hr drive from GTA. ""personally"" I would much rather save the gas money and shop LeBaron and or Sail and then Bass in that order. If you are shopping cost, LeBaron is almost always the best for that. If you want better service, I find all three are on par and find uncaring and ignorant salespeople the same across the board, then spend any amount of time and $ in any of them and you can strike a repoire and get the service you want.  I realize there are LeBaron HATERS out there but I honestly love it. My son and I go there quite a bit and know half the staff, almost like Norm walking into Cheers. YMMV"
746533,kickingfrog,2012-11-25 16:01:00,8333,Different stores will have different prices for different items.  My local stores prices may not what a chain's prices will be but gas is $1.25/litre and it's an hour and a half minimum round trip to a chain for me.
746587,MCTFisher9120,2012-11-25 20:30:00,3761,"Cyber Monday start's at midnight tonight!  http://gagnonsports.com/news.html  15% off shimano and 20% off everything reg priced. Should be fun, didn't get to see you today Geoff   Just posting this little link, it's new for us but with all the online gear I/we have been putting up it's time to see where the kinks are. And I still like my local shops don't forget. When I'm in Lindsay i stop into the shop by the locks and all my minnows this winter will be from tightlines  Anyway good luck this season guys MTBF"

745515,206,2012-11-21 16:41:00,563,Just thinking about this Friday or monday and if anyone would like to share great deals or ones some of us here might like!  i just seen best buy and thought i'd start this thread   GoPro HD HERO2 Outdoor Helmet Camcorder $179.99 Save: $170

745524,Fisherman,2012-11-21 17:33:00,7201,"With all those wierdos in the stores, it might just be peace and quiet on the water."
745532,John,2012-11-21 18:04:00,2956,Stores open at 12.01am Friday........so if you feel inclined to self abuse go for it. Maybe just media hype but there is talk of 3 hr line up's at the border.
745539,Marko,2012-11-21 18:16:00,854,YOu would have to drag me by my sideburns to get me to go to one of these malls on a day like that....i dont think i would go and wait in line if they were giving crap out for free lol
745540,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-21 18:16:00,10439,Staples will have 32GB Blackberry Playbook tablets on for $118 on Friday.
745550,registerfly,2012-11-21 18:54:00,198,"   this isn't hype, guaranteed at least. I did my US shopping Monday, got some good deals, no lineups anywhere and great day to play hookie with the wife.  I don't believe there is anything in this world that would be worth the line ups involved unless they were giving away organs, and it was my blood type.  (body)   And if they open at 12am, they're late. This year they are starting between 8 and 9pm, THURSDAY during dinner. Some states workers have set up protests about the earlier hours despite holiday pay."

For her, it's a weekend away with the girls. For me, it would be a weekend of incredible self restraint to not say, and do, the first thing that came to mind."
745780,Spiel,2012-11-22 19:28:00,9065,"Good Lord, has it been a year already!  One year ago tomorrow (Black Friday) I took a road trip to pick up 1000 cork rings (all long gone). Upon arriving home the weather was just to gorgeous not to attend to some outside chores. I decided to clean the eaves troughs before the cold set in permanently. Didn't take long before I fell off the roof into the neighbours driveway breaking several ribs on my left side (front and back), two fingers on my left hand and my wrist in three places....... *ouch*  The next day I cut off the cast and removed the finger splints so I could work on rod building......LOL  Thinking I'll stay off the ladder tomorrow."

745984,Lip-ripper,2012-11-23 16:47:00,228,this is the best deal I've come across... a $375 Lowrance fishfinder for $99. Too bad I just bought a humminbird...  http://radioworld.ca...ble-p-8005.html
745988,Jigger,2012-11-23 17:06:00,1237,Was looking for a Dslr camera. The difference between prices Stateside vs Canada are staggering. Were getting fleeced 10/10. Its really no wonder people run south when these deals are on.
