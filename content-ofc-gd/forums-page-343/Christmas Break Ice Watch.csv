754627,Locnar,2012-12-27 18:09:00,645, Ya think out by Goreski's would be iced over nicely? I'm definitely itching to get out there
754725,bigbuckzone,2012-12-28 04:02:00,7, I haven't been down that way but the only thing I can tell you is that the ice is very uneven and lots of wet spots so stay near shore and don't go anywhere where you think there might be current.
754824,fishboy,2012-12-28 19:45:00,550,please keep me up to date...hoping to be up after New Years ! 
750324,jedimaster,2012-12-09 02:49:00,3472,"Well the longterm looks mediocre with daytime temps above zero for the next week but the nighttimes look like crackin temps..Any reports on Ice on the back lakes? Post your area, pictures and ice if you have, lets keep everyone christmas spirits up with some ice..."
750326,Joeytier,2012-12-09 02:54:00,3990,"Small lakes in the near north region are mostly safe, and will likely be very solid [5+""] by next weekend."
750348,Rod Caster,2012-12-09 05:03:00,5784,"2.5"" black ice on a small splake lake today. Still not safe yet., but a good base. This is northbay area"
750436,Nipfisher,2012-12-09 17:17:00,2449,  R.C. have you checked / heard about the bay we fished last year on Nosbonsing. Been on it 3 times before Christmas.
750531,Rod Caster,2012-12-09 22:09:00,5784," Haven't checked that spot yet... I might be looking for some perch next weekend so I'll probably check then.  Today, still only 3"" or less...the ice didnt' really form last night with the snow cover. So close, yet so far."
750576,chris.brock,2012-12-10 00:33:00,4053,Haliburton big lakes have a skim in the back bays smaller lakes are barely frozen over with less than an inch
750628,Basskicker,2012-12-10 03:01:00,421,"Manitouwadge  6-8"" ice on smaller lakes, no snow and making GREAT ice every night...-15 to -20 the last few nights!!!"
751233,jedimaster,2012-12-12 12:51:00,3472, From the highway north of youngs point... omw bow hunting.
751235,jedimaster,2012-12-12 13:30:00,3472,"Some of the deeper spots have wet spots, springs on shore and around some stumps are wet. Looks like good ice coverage across all areas. This is paudash... "
751241,lew,2012-12-12 13:53:00,12766, You drove right past my place and the coffee pot's always on.
751283,Sinker,2012-12-12 16:08:00,8692,"Drove thru Bewdley today. Rice lake was ice as far as I could see. Still some geese waaaaay out in the middle though, so there is still some open water out there. I didn't stop to check thickness, but It certainly didn't look like much.  S."
751380,Handlebarz,2012-12-12 21:15:00,3790,Lsc is wide open and that is great as the boat is hooked up ready to go
754365,jedimaster,2012-12-25 14:23:00,3472,"Any updates for the apsley or north area, or a Halliburton?"
754428,GoneFishin,2012-12-26 01:44:00,349, Ill be going up that way sometime this week for some spake and im hoping to test out my sled. Does anyone know if there is snow up that way yet?
754436,Ryan Landry,2012-12-26 03:02:00,128,"Most of the back lakes north of sudbury should be good. The ones we fished have 4-6"" on the bottom layer and 2"" on the top with about 4"" of slush in between. In a few more days they should lock together for a good 10-12""."
754437,NAW,2012-12-26 03:25:00,4022,I've been trying to post local Ice report the past 2 weeks.  But things have been crazy.  Little lake Barrie was open in the middle on Monday.  Orr lake is skimmed Over but far from safe!
754439,bigbuckzone,2012-12-26 03:52:00,7,"Scugog is very patchy. Some areas have been frozen for most of December, but other bays are wide open. By new years I should be perch fishing near shore, I definately wouldn't put the huts out for at least a few weeks though."
754440,Mack66,2012-12-26 04:00:00,19," There's maybe 2"" in front of my house, I can stand on it but wouldn't go more than 5' from shore for fear of getting wet feet lol, lots of damp spots too. Hopefully I'll be walking out new years day."
754441,Christopheraaron,2012-12-26 04:05:00,3525,Any news on the Halliburton ponds?
754442,jedimaster,2012-12-26 04:25:00,3472,Hopefully going to go this week somewhere between bancroft and apsley but it may be a last minute type of decision. Was hoping things would have locked up by now.
754451,fishindevil,2012-12-26 11:56:00,6254,The smaller lakes In Haliburton were froze and had a few inches but they have got about 8-10 inches of snow and is insulating them but guys are out walking and fishing on them !!!! It's cold there today and its helping for sure !!!! But yes guys are out on lakes in the Dorset Haliburton forest area .... Stay off the big lakes  lots of slushy spots and open water on them !!!! That's a report from last night  by brother -inlaw is a plow driver for Haliburton county ... He knows has been there for 40yrs....
754481,Jigger,2012-12-26 18:14:00,1237,"Promising day up here on 12Mile L. The lake was wide open exept for the bays last night and is pretty much ice all the way across today. If the snow stays off and the temps/wind low, should be some very fishable lakes up here in the newyear!"
754525,Rod Caster,2012-12-26 23:29:00,5784,6-8 inches on a splake lake near north bay today. Cold as heck out there too
754530,Locnar,2012-12-26 23:41:00,645,Anyone have any news on the back lakes near Gooderham?
754619,bigbuckzone,2012-12-27 16:57:00,7,"Was out on Scugog today on 2.5 to 4 inches, drilled about a half dozen holes within 400 ft from shore along starrs beach. didn't catch any perch, probably because I got a late start. Ill give it a shot tomorrow morning so I'll let you guys know how it goes. My friends were apparently into some crappie closer to Port Perry but im not sure how safe the ice is down there"
