Out the door i went off to town and into the butcher shop and asked for 5 lbs of beef and 5 lbs of pork hamberger ..... told then twice not to lean and twice it was redone to get some red out .... lol . Now into another store i fly , grabbing 4 spainsh onions , small bag of potatoes , a container of bread crumes , salt , pepper , and sage then headed for home , i had every thing i need but i could'nt help thinking we proably all ready have all this stuff at home , what ta hell i don't care and this is my idea any ways .... lol . Now home and in the cupboards i don't see a pot big enough to hold those two packages of meat i just bought , ha ha ha .... theres a good size roasting pan , i think thats what you call it but any way its big enough to hold 5lbs of gound beef and 2 1/2 lbs of gound pork ...... not to lean ... lol , so i set the burnner on number 3 , added one cup of water to the roasting pan and thru in all the meat , its a good idea to keep stiring it til its cooked ... which i did ... lol , at the same time i peeled 5 good size potatoes and put them to cooking , then i choped up two of those spanish onoins .... now remember i "" DO NOT COOK"" never never never do i cook ! , but any ways the meats done now , the pan is still full to the top and its allso full to the top with some kind of juice, so i got a jar and drain it all off , now while every thing is still hot i add in all of the two spanish onions and all the potatoes that i mashed up , still with the burnner set on three i cooked them in stirring every thing the hole time , then came the taste test ..... hum not bad put it needs so i added in one cup of bread crumes , 1/4 can of sweet peas just to give it a pinch of coulor , one table spoon of salt , one table spoon of black pepper and one table spoon of sage and did another taste test ..... Bam !! to me its perfect . Now what ta hell am i going to do with it , i have no where to put it ???????? , in the jeep and back into town i go to the food store again right into the frozen section and i grabbed 8 boxs of deep dish tenderflake pie shells then speed back home . Thawing the dam things out took for ever they did , so to help them out i place then all on a thick towlle .  After cooking all that meat and having a full roasting pan i only had enough ingredints to make six of the nicest bestest tasting FRENCH TOURTIERS i ever tasted and i never cook ....... never ! . O'' ya .... lol now the wife walks in from work and says WHAT TA HELL !!!!  THE KITCHENS A MESS !!! , right then and there i've already got one pie cooked with a slice cut and i go here try this and right away she go's no way but i make her and she dose , then she says this is awsome , you did'nt make it , who helped you , as she did all the clean up and washed all the dishs as i rested with my feet up with my five pies in da fridge . Merry CHRISTMAS TODAY every one and may all your meals today taste as good as ours dose ..... lol ."
