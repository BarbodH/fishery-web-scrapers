754037,Joeytier,2012-12-23 21:21:00,3990,"Between visiting friends and family and a promising job interview I've managed to put 1500 + km on the truck in the past 4-5 days.  Since those in the banana belt seem to be parched of winter, I thought I'd share a few shots of my icecapades over the weekend.  Didn't think I'd need the snowshoes for this little splake lake...I was wrong.      Only one measly troot made it above the ice, but since most of the time was spent on shore so as to avoid getting swept away in the 70 k winds, it was alright.  Spent a few hours chasing pikers and eyeballs on a local lake...  The weather was great and we experienced some great flurries of action.  There's no ice like early ice...  Everyone loves the sink shot...   Also got to meet OFC member Cosmo, and watch him school the locals with some seriously chunky walters.  Good job dood"
