753894,kemper,2012-12-22 18:34:00,2232,"Batson hardware, Chris?  I'm trying to find a source for some anodized hardware, I know Ernie gets it but a little pricey for me..."
753896,Spiel,2012-12-22 18:49:00,9065," Yes Sir, Titanuim anodized Batson, 8.5."
753899,kemper,2012-12-22 19:12:00,2232,"  Used a CA finish on this stuff, but less coats and polishing because I didn't want the mirror shine"
753902,Spiel,2012-12-22 19:30:00,9065,Looks great Bud.
753915,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-22 21:10:00,10439,Just brought home a new toy for my shop.  
753916,kickingfrog,2012-12-22 21:18:00,8333,  Looks a little different then the one I used in shop class.
753917,Spiel,2012-12-22 21:22:00,9065, Isn't that the one you got several months back or is it another one?
753931,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-22 22:52:00,10439,"  Same one, just finally got it home. It's been at work since I got it because I was renovating @ home and had nowhere to put it. Still not done with the renos but the shop area should be done next week."
753933,Spiel,2012-12-22 22:58:00,9065, I'm sure your happy to finally have it home Dave.  Looking forward to seeing what comes off it down the road.
753988,Spiel,2012-12-23 14:30:00,9065,Well the glue was dry this morning so I now have the matching butt caps.   
754010,kemper,2012-12-23 17:41:00,2232, Gorgeous.  Struble hardware on the middle one?
754016,Spiel,2012-12-23 18:11:00,9065,"  Thanks Brady, yes Struble on the middle one for effect only."
754029,spinnerdoc,2012-12-23 19:21:00,556," Those are some nice looking wood Chris, I esp. like the square blanks     I'm sure you'll make excellent work out of em."
754036,ChrisK,2012-12-23 20:31:00,2772,The green one on the bottom is mine   I know it looks blue but it will be green when its done like this one  
754274,Spiel,2012-12-24 21:33:00,9065,"One more just for you Albert (HTHM).  It's Cherry, not overly exotic but it's real nice and will look sweet on the right fly rod.  It came in a box of assorted hard woods from Aplumma (thanks again Art  ) and it's the first one I've turned from a very large selection sent.    "
752992,Spiel,2012-12-18 20:46:00,9065,"I had a bunch of wood come in yesterday and I've been busy turning it from square blocks to round. They're a long way away from being reel seats at this point but boy oh boy, they're some real nice pieces of wood.  They start as 1.5"" X 1.5"" as seen here.....       Two long pieces that'll make many seats. The top is Padauk and the bottom is Bocote.     These are stabilized, Spalted Big Leaf Maple, very nice.     Again stabilized Big Leaf Maple, this time burl the bottom one is green dyed and will be on ChrisK's new rod.      Not much to look at yet but once they are shaped, finished and polished they'll be gorgeous!"
752993,solopaddler,2012-12-18 20:50:00,8605,"Love the maple, looks great!"
752996,Twocoda,2012-12-18 20:53:00,4130,What Mike said ^^^
752998,Joey,2012-12-18 20:58:00,9122,"Wow, those are beautiful"
753003,kickingfrog,2012-12-18 21:10:00,8333,"You knew someone was going to say it, I'm just surprised it took 4 people.    Nice wood."
753008,misfish,2012-12-18 21:15:00,29133,"I wonder,,,,,, One of them would look great for my fixed seat section.Match the wrap and reel.  Is that still do able Chris?  Nice colors.   Edit,I would like one as duck call as well."
753010,Spiel,2012-12-18 21:19:00,9065, Sure it's doable Brian but labour intensive ($).
753039,John,2012-12-18 22:42:00,2956,"Lovin' the maple Chris.......let's talk, maybe save me a piece until I know what I want..."
753042,HTHM,2012-12-18 22:47:00,4082,Do you ever use cherry?
753052,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-18 23:16:00,10439,Love the stabilized spalted maple. I used a piece of it dyed blue for my Z-Axis build. I did a CA finish on my seat that turned out really sweet!!! Very purdy.      
753055,misfish,2012-12-18 23:19:00,29133,That is a piece of art Dave.
753074,Twocoda,2012-12-18 23:55:00,4130,What Misfish said ^^^ Dave
753122,ChrisK,2012-12-19 03:22:00,2772, Sweet!! :worthy:  :worthy:
753169,rhare,2012-12-19 13:22:00,387,Love the spalted BLM burl can't wait to see it in handle form.
753219,Spiel,2012-12-19 17:04:00,9065," No, not to date Albert, though I do have a few pieces here."
753271,Ainsley,2012-12-19 21:51:00,142,Very nice! That would make some sweet knife handles.  Do you ever work with desert ironwood burl or cocobolo?
753393,fishin jesus,2012-12-20 16:18:00,53,what a true artform...just amazing to see   
753671,Spiel,2012-12-21 19:42:00,9065," Iron wood no, not yet. Cocobolo yes.     Keep in kind most of my wood seats for float rods are done by a good friend.  However I do turn some here, this one is for a fly rod, I just finished it moments ago. Orange dyed Padauk finished in 15 coats of CA and fitted with bronze hardware.   "
753684,misfish,2012-12-21 20:27:00,29133,Dats purdy.
753694,Bill Shearer,2012-12-21 20:55:00,456,"CA does a wonderful job! A little scary the first time, but a very hard and durable finish. Well done Chris! Too bad that it is so difficult to do that finish on a JC style seat! Just too many bumps in the road, I fear. The mental picture of trying to polish that without it being on the lathe brings tears of laughter!!"
753859,mistaredone,2012-12-22 14:27:00,913,Absolutely amazing work!!!  Just wondering what CA is?  Ever thought of doing a YouTube video of the process or would that be giving away trade secrets?
753863,kemper,2012-12-22 15:10:00,2232," Not too much of a secret, CA is essentially super glue. With many coats and some careful work you can achieve a glass like finish.  There are some YouTube videos that describe the process."
753865,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-22 15:30:00,10439,"  Check youtube for CA finishing as well as penturning web sites. For the sand papers (down to 12,000 grit) & CA I got from Lee Valley.  CA Glues  I use these by hand and not on a power sander.  Micro Mesh Disks  Some CA finish videos"
753870,Spiel,2012-12-22 16:47:00,9065," I see you query has been thoroughly answered, thanks guys.  Video(s), no there's plenty up there now, not sure I could add anything of value."
753887,Spiel,2012-12-22 17:49:00,9065,"Still playing on the lathe, much fun.        "
