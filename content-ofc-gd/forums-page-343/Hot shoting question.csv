Can be boring to some,but I like doing it.The spring is killer.   My question is,will it work at this time of year? Water is super cold now,and getting real clear. Im thinking the bait has to be placed right in front of their face at this time of year.  Your thoughts and experince."
754500,Snidley,2012-12-26 20:18:00,620,"I use hotshotting at the Niagara year round but thats really deep water with lots of fish and current. It's less successful is streams after the weather gets cold, better to use spinners, spoons and crankbaits simply cast and retrieved. They still will hit moving baits in the cold."
754503,esoxansteel,2012-12-26 20:51:00,1307,"Definately works this time of year, wobbling plugs like hotshots, and flatfish, quickfish, and fireplugs etc, letting them wobble in deep runs or holes, and also arching them through the runs as well, especially effective on Coho's as well as steelhead."

754540,BillM,2012-12-27 01:13:00,17367,"As long as it's slow, they'll smack pretty much anything."
754581,moxie,2012-12-27 13:37:00,1566," Was at Duffins Creek yesterday and my buddy  had a take down while holding his phone to his ear and the bait dangling in the current. Actually hit it twice. No matter how cold it gets, when I'm hungry and if it ain't there in front of me, I will chase food."
754610,Rustic-Fisher,2012-12-27 16:09:00,826,I've seen guys doing if along ice shelves and getting fish.Another outing a guy was letting his Kwik fish hotshot under a large ice formation and pulled a decent rainbow right from under our noses !! I'd say deffinitly worth a try
