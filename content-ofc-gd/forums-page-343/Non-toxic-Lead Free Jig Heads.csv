I have been checking online for suppliers of Lead Free or Non-Toxic jig heads for some time.  I would prefer a supplier from Canada, but I would consider an American manufacturer.  There are a few sources from China but I want to avoid them.  I found a couple of suppliers...  Canadian: Larry's Lures and Jigs First Mate Lures Sourdough Bay Fishing Supplies  American: Green Tackle Lead Free Jig Heads   Ideally I would like the price point to be around $0.50 per jig."
