754402,bobowski,2012-12-25 19:52:00,360,With some steady minus temps in the forecast over the next week or so im getting super pumped to kick off my ice fishing season. Im hoping to be out on simcoe in two weeks. Do you guys think this is realistic? I certainly do. Can't wait for bacon wrapped perch.
