753428,reelinrolly,2012-12-20 17:52:00,281,Hey guys  I am looking at getting a fish finder for both the bow an console of my boat  I will be doing a lot of drop shorting. And would like to have both units networked together  I have a $2000 budget to work with.   Any suggestions??
753530,hirk,2012-12-21 00:52:00,571,How deep and what kind of cover do you usually fish?
753535,trapshooter,2012-12-21 01:37:00,1234,I have a Humminbird 788 on the bow and a 898 at the back.  Sweet graphs that are networked together.  Should be close to your price range.
753552,bassfanatic25,2012-12-21 02:40:00,36,A Lowrance HDS7 Gen2 on the console and HDS5 Gen2 at the bow would be a nice combo to have networked together and would put you right under that $2000 mark and you would still have the option of adding the Structure Scan side/down imaging at a later date if you wanted.
753562,moemoe,2012-12-21 06:57:00,352,"sail actually has the hds 7 gen 2 on for 749, plus a 150 rebate, 2 would put you well below your target price, rebate is a visa gift card though"
753564,wormdunker,2012-12-21 08:02:00,1711,I bought a new Bird 798 with side image & down scan.  Love this unit.

He will set the units up for you no messing around and no Bull. His customer service is second to none.
