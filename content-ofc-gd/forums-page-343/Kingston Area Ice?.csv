Just wondering if anyone knows anywhere near Kingston where the ice is good yet? I was able to fish Dog lake by this time last year, anybody been out there yet, in particular Maple Hill in Dog Lake?  I would appreciate any advice as to where you have been in the area that had ice, or even if the ice was no good a heads up is also good, if you noticed ice starting or people out fishing, anything is appreciated !  Also, Bay of Quinte ice reports needed/appreciated."
