754234,misfish,2012-12-24 19:47:00,29133,"I have been looking at under water cameras,really wanted to go the GOPRO way,but was siting on the fence. The mrs,s and I decided not to get each others gifts this year,and concentrate on the grand kids.We get each other stuff all the time anyways.  Well,she didnt keep her side of the bargain. Yesterday,she comes up to me and says,here ya go,it,s not a Christmas gift.   I was handed a bag,and what was inside   Well first off,it was out with the old,it has served me well,,,,,,,,,,,    And in with the new,,,,,,,,,  XP50         Man I cant wait to hit the water with this. Under water shots/videos, are going to be so cool. Fuji has some real good stuff on youtube to learn about the camera.    I had to get her something now,and I did. I,ll just give her the gift Christmas day,and say,it,s not a Christmas gift.  First pic I took.  "
