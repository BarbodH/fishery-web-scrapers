753875,Guest,2012-12-22 17:08:00,0,"Hows it going guys.  I am very new and have asked a few questions already which you guys have been awesome in answering.  And just to let you know that im more of a questions quy then an answers guy.  If that makes any sense lol.  Anyways just wondering if anyone can tell me how to obtain a depth chart for Lake Simcoe.  Was wondering were all the deep spots are.  I have a small one around Georgian Island that I found on a website, but would like to see everything on Simcoe.  Next year I will probably buy a vexilar (I think thats what my brother told me to buy), but to have a successful ice fishing season I need to know the depths especially around cooks bay.  Thanks guys."
753880,mike rousseau,2012-12-22 17:26:00,4661,If you have an iPhone.... Get the navionics app
753881,Live2fish85,2012-12-22 17:29:00,1633,Yep any Android phone or iPhone  has the app for navionics and it's great.
753883,Guest,2012-12-22 17:32:00,0,"Sorry guys, but no iphone for me.  It would have to be a website that I go to so I can print off the map.  Thanks anyways"
753886,Beans,2012-12-22 17:47:00,3339,I've got a map that I bought at CTC that covers Lake Simcoe and Cook's Bay...the finish on it makes it waterproof and it has Bob Izumi's name on it...It shows the depths...

753889,Jon,2012-12-22 18:13:00,209,A quick Google search should find some.  One of the Lake Simcoe boards used to have depth charts on-line as well.  Jon
753893,Fang,2012-12-22 18:29:00,1330,What you need is a trent Severn waterway map #2028  Harder and harder to find these as everyone is going digital

753935,dhickey,2012-12-22 23:07:00,1038,Maps are nice to have but your main concern should be .? Where are the presure cracks and where is the good ice..
753976,Guest,2012-12-23 10:46:00,0,Thanks guys for the info.  I found the chart that I was looking for.  Lake Simcoe will now be fished out so any of you guys who enjoying fishing there you might want to find somewhere new.lol
