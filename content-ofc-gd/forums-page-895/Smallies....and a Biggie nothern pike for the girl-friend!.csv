We decided to hit a VERRRY small lake. were i knew there was pike and bass.  the plan was to hit it in the A.M.  good thing we did.......  the day starts of with me hitting a fair 3 lbs pike.    then one of my buddies tip-up goes down....... SLOWLY.... B.A.S.S!    his first ever on ice!  winds picking up and my girl-friend (stephanie) keeps complainning.  but this time she was going to warm up.  a tip-up goes down and its her turn to grab it. RUN!!!  she sets the hook like a pro and what seems to be a small bite ends up beeing a real nice fight!.....  well let me tell you folks she fought this pike like a pro... it took 3-4 runs and she let the slack go . didnt horse it in NOTHING!  BANG she lands it!      A serriouse 5.6 lbs pike ! her PB on the ice!  from this point the bite slows down .....  a couple more bass action kept us busy tho.    mike with his dinner.    STIFFY!    TWAS a nice day to be out with the ''WIFE'' and friends.  all fish were kept for tonights FEAST!  we cought some fish but the biggest thing we cought today was a........SUNBURN BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  hope you enjoi the report!               P.S :  How did a summer pictures get there!

306777,jwl,2009-02-15 21:06:00,1056,"nice fishin..you guys must be the first people to say a chunky little pike like that is only 3lbs  , it's really probably bigger than that..even a nice chunky 26 incher for example is pushing 5-7 lbs"

306836,steverowbotham,2009-02-16 00:09:00,1800,"I'm usually the first to criticize ppl on exaggerating the size of their fish, but those pike look to be bigger than you stated."
