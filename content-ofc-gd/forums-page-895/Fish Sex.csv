307611,HTHM,2009-02-18 00:29:00,4082,"How does one determine what sex a fish is? I have yet to see one with ""bits that swing in the breeze"". This is a genuine question, because I do not know."
307613,douG,2009-02-18 00:32:00,2693,"I think this is a sorta personal question, of interest to only another dogfish / catfish / goby, whatever.  Yer sounding a little pushy right there."
307614,misfish,2009-02-18 00:35:00,29133,"Some fish it,s the mouth. Hook nosed or what ever. I know I was told the one with the biggest kype was the male."
307625,Joeytier,2009-02-18 01:07:00,3990,"It's far more obvious with some fish.  For example, 99% of the larger, fat perch you catch this time of the year and into the spring are females, and male salmon and rainbow both typically get very dark and develop kypes when spawning.  Some species like bass it's very difficult to tell."
