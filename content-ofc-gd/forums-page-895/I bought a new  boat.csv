307824,corvette1,2009-02-18 15:32:00,1765,what a sweet ride congrats
307832,Spiel,2009-02-18 15:51:00,9065,"Very nice Lew. For and aft casting decks, how perfect is that."
307844,fishnsled,2009-02-18 16:58:00,3520,Great looking ride Lew.    I'll tow it for you anytime if you like/need.  Of course I'd have to help you slim it up at the end of the tow     Congrats!
307858,BUSTER,2009-02-18 17:33:00,1336, you should call her       LEWSKIES
307275,John,2009-02-17 03:11:00,2956,Congrat's Lew that's a great looking boat........
307277,ohhenrygsr,2009-02-17 03:12:00,947,"hey Lew congrats.  I dunno what you where thinking about posting your new boat on this forum but if you read the fine print on becoming a member of OFC.  It states that anyone who starts a thread of the new boat they bought, the member must take everyone that post in the thread out fishing in your new boat.  Well enjoy it LOL"
307280,tschirk,2009-02-17 03:25:00,261,Awsome ride Lew! Your are going to love the ride of a glass boat on those rougher days. The longer length will make for a nice ride too. Cheers Ted
307354,pikehunter,2009-02-17 12:14:00,1659,Really nice Lew   You're going to have many many hours of happiness!
307356,b2kptbo,2009-02-17 12:19:00,1505,"Very nice Lew, good for you..."
307365,Gerry,2009-02-17 13:14:00,257,"Nice boat. Did you get a kicker for it?  The downeasters are great rod holders but they will roll when mounted on the rails, you just can't get them tight enough. If they do let me know because I've got a fix for that."
307366,lew,2009-02-17 13:18:00,12766,"Thanks again for all the positive feedback folks, it means alot to hear that cause there's nothing worse than writing a large cheque & then having everybody tell you that you just bought yourself a piece of crappola  I've used either Merc's or Johnsons my entire life and have owned alot of them over the years and never had a problem with any of them, but this is my 1st venture into a Japanese motor but I've got several friends who run them and they all say how great they are, so that's a good thing too.   It's hard to narrow down as to exactly why I bought this particular outfit over the other ones Cudz, but it just seemed to ""fit & feel"" right and I knew it was the one for me. I looked at, and compared alot of similar boats in the last couple months, both physically and on-line and this one had it all together just the way I wanted it.  Not saying it's better or worse than any of others on the market, but for my wants & needs this just seemed to be the one, plus Skeeter & Yamaha both have excellent reputations. It'll probably also be the last boat I buy so I wanted something that's gonna last a few years and hopefully this'll do the trick.  And no Gerry, I didn't get a kicker as I don't troll slow anyways, but can always buy one later if I decide I need one. As for the DownEasters on the grab rails, I just assumed they'd lock on tight enough with the proper mount but I've never tried that particular set-up before, so I spose I'll just have to try it and see how it works. I don't like the idea of drilling any holes in the glass."
307367,Mike the Pike,2009-02-17 13:24:00,3421,Congrats to you Lew what a beautiful boat I guess you will now have a roof and be much warmer and dryer when the weather gets ugly.   Now bigger boat =Bigger fish right   MTP
307372,Beans,2009-02-17 13:34:00,3339, Sounds like the story of my life...  You're talking about Lew's new boat  Sweet lookin' ride Lew...Congrats !!!
307375,Roy,2009-02-17 13:41:00,13728,"Lew, I would imagine that if the holders slip a little on the rails, the best fix for that would be a 'cut to size' thin piece of rubber (inner tube) around the rail under the clamp. It would also serve as protection against marring those new rails."
307376,aniceguy,2009-02-17 13:52:00,1094,Lew I had a friend look at the exact same boat and color at the show and I was pretty impressed with the boat there was nothing missing and at the price it was a serious deal...Im guessing you picked up the one from the show
307402,tinbanger,2009-02-17 15:46:00,1028,gosh I don't log on for a couple of days and you go and buy a boat !  Nice looking rig. will keep an eye out for you this summer.  TB
307436,Squid,2009-02-17 17:06:00,1656,I call shotgun!!
307438,TJQ,2009-02-17 17:14:00,7806,Good for you Lew.. you deserve it.
307439,DT10Sam,2009-02-17 17:17:00,480,"That a boy Bud  Regards, Sam"
307461,irishfield,2009-02-17 18:45:00,26272, That's perfect Pete... you put the first scratch in the side of her with a believer and then I'll go the next trip when Lew's cooled off !
307465,lew,2009-02-17 19:18:00,12766,"Yer right Wayne, the 1st guy that dings it will be having a long swim back to the dock"
307481,mikeh,2009-02-17 20:18:00,824,"Lew, I'd recommend picking up a keel guard for the front of the boat, I'm not sure if BPS stocks them , if you want one you might have to order from the states."
307533,Stoty,2009-02-17 21:57:00,2910,Nice rig Lew! Congrats!
307537,icefisherman,2009-02-17 22:05:00,952,"Simply beautifull Lew. Congratulations and hope to see you on the Great Lakes with it this coming season ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
307542,Handlebarz,2009-02-17 22:17:00,3790,Very nice ride for sure Lew I guess you got sick of riding in others covered boats in the late fall and had to make the jump right Pete.  As for them rail mounts the guys here use them all the time and they work great ask george he will let ya know what you need he has set up many boats with them I also like them for another reason you can twist them down for down rods or up out of the water and make the bait run higher with out taking in line I would have put them on my boat but the rails were just not a option.  I cant wait to see her this year congratz on the new girl so does Pete or Sherry get the first ride for musky?
307622,bassdreamer,2009-02-18 01:05:00,128,awesome looking boat lew.
307638,jediangler,2009-02-18 01:27:00,1923,"Congrats on the new boat. A friend of mine bought a skeeter bass boat 5 yrs ago. He's been very happy with it, and man that thing can fly."
307710,Ron,2009-02-18 04:33:00,1683,"Nice ride Lew!  Does this mean you have to start your Muskie count all over again?  Sharp looking and well built, how can you go wrong with that? Perhaps the missus will get out with you more often too!"
307729,Sinker,2009-02-18 05:35:00,8692,Nice boat Lew!! have you picked a name for her yet?  Sinker
307174,glen,2009-02-17 00:10:00,2641,Is it a ski boat?
307175,Rich Clemens,2009-02-17 00:11:00,3131,Sweet ride Lew.   Glad you were able to fulfill your dream.   Not too long now until you'll have the opportunity to really get that slimed up.
307177,cram,2009-02-17 00:11:00,1733,Beautiful boat. I am very jealous.
307178,kickingfrog,2009-02-17 00:12:00,8333,Muski
307180,glen,2009-02-17 00:15:00,2641,Ya i guess i could fish out of it.
307182,OhioFisherman,2009-02-17 00:17:00,6623,Nice ride Lew !
307188,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-17 00:26:00,260,Awesome boat Lew congrats  You will be very pleased with the 'glass ride and stability.  I would not want anything but a 'glass boat after running one for years.  I have been in one of these and I must say they are spectacular.  Good choice with the four stroke
307190,Squid,2009-02-17 00:29:00,1656,"Its going to be awesome seeing Lew in his new boat netting my muskie. HAHAHAHAHA just kidding buddy, sweet sweet ride."
307201,Roy,2009-02-17 00:37:00,13728,Congrats Lew! Very nice indeed. I never figured you for a glass kinda guy. Ok now who's the poor dude who has to drill holes in her to put the rod holder tracks in? You're gunna FLY in that thing! GREAT!
307203,Leecher,2009-02-17 00:38:00,7832,Great looking rig Lew     Congratulations
307222,lew,2009-02-17 01:14:00,12766,"Thanks folks, I hope it turns out as good as I figure it will.   And Roy, there won't be any holes going in that glass and the DownEasters will be mounted on the siderails. Just the thought of drilling those holes gave me the shivers"
307226,Radnine,2009-02-17 01:18:00,1538,"Congrats Lew, Is that the one you were looking at when I was chatting up your better half? Jim"
307230,Cudz,2009-02-17 01:21:00,2652,"That is a sweet boat indeed!!  Exactly what I have been looking for.  If you don't mind me asking, what made you choose the skeeter over the lund fg tyee or the stratos 386 or the champion etc?  In other words, what does this boat offer that would make you pony up the $$ over the others. I absolutely love it."
307231,Dano,2009-02-17 01:27:00,719,"Wow! Congratulations Lew, she looks like a sweeeet ride!"
307239,Rizzo,2009-02-17 01:36:00,4754,What a machine! Very nice Lew...may you get 5 good years out of it and then sell it to me for a song

307273,TerryC,2009-02-17 03:08:00,196,Sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
307124,lew,2009-02-16 22:59:00,12766,"I've been looking around for a new boat  for a couple months now and finally decided on a new fiberglass Skeeter and went out today and bought it.  It's 18' 9"" long with a full windshield and comes with a new 150 HP Yamaha 4 stroke with a stainless steel prop and on the front I went with a 24 volt MinnKota Maxumm with 80 pound thrust.  The boat in the picture is identical to mine, 'cept mine is gonna be mostly burgundy on top and white on the bottom with beige carpet and grey seats and the trailer is also burgundy with chrome wheels & surge brakes and is a great looking combo.  I  went with a bugundy snap-on trailering cover and am also getting the full standup cover with clear side curtains for fishing on those cold, snowy November & December days.  It's all fiberglass with no wood anywhere in the construction, and also has the hydraulic steering system so there's no steering wheel torque to worry about anymore and it also has tilt steering, stereo system and adjustable seat.  It has a built in flasher in the dash, and I'm also gonna keep my sonar & GPS units from my current boat and install them too.  I've wanted a big glass boat for quite awhile and with the 150 Yammy  I think it's gonna make a nice set-up for me and my fishing partners and also a smooth ride when things start getting rough on some of the bigger waters I fish  Just thought I'd share it with everyone.  This picture seems a bit blurry but if you click the top and make it full size, it comes out clearer.  Life is good  "
307127,Terry,2009-02-16 23:00:00,14456,wow nice boat
307130,GeorgeJ,2009-02-16 23:02:00,207,the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the picture was WOW! CONGRATS!
307131,salmon,2009-02-16 23:03:00,334,"Congrats, very nice  Jose"
307133,Bernie,2009-02-16 23:05:00,3190,You will like the glass Lew. It's still my preference for how I use a boat.
307134,Grimace,2009-02-16 23:06:00,2020,That is a gorgeous boat.
307135,highdrifter,2009-02-16 23:07:00,2534,Great looking boat Lew!!  Nice of you to think of the non-fisher folk too..  A coupla fat sacks in the mid section and she'd be a great wakeboard boat!!  Happy fishing.  Life is good ain't she?!  cheers HD
307140,BUSTER,2009-02-16 23:10:00,1336,stellar!

307145,HTHM,2009-02-16 23:15:00,4082,gorgeous!!! I hope you get many gallons of slime over her
307147,misfish,2009-02-16 23:16:00,29133,Very nice boat lew.Nice pick. I missed your sale of the old one??????
307149,mikeh,2009-02-16 23:17:00,824,"congrats, nice boat and with a four stroke also. Was that the one at the fishing show?"
307150,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-16 23:17:00,0,"  never go wrong with a skeeter the first bass boat and the best boat period, other may try!!!!  Lew hit skeeter up for a jacket or inflateable lifejackets they are good that way I asked and they just kept giving me"
307151,medmart,2009-02-16 23:19:00,587,Great looking boat Lew congrats
307152,Joey,2009-02-16 23:22:00,9122,"Congrats Lew, that's fantastic.  I'm so happy for you  Very nice looking boat  Joey"
307153,misfish,2009-02-16 23:24:00,29133, I dont think Lew has BASS on his mind.LOL
307154,misfish,2009-02-16 23:28:00,29133,That 80 maybe a bit under rated for your boat Lew IMO. Alot of glass to pull around.You can always upgrade if you dont like it
307157,motv8tr,2009-02-16 23:42:00,2587,"VERY NICE!!!  I look forward to seeing live and up close   I'm sure as nice as the picture is, it doesn't do it justice at all!!!  Enjoy!!!  Maureen"
307161,jwl,2009-02-16 23:46:00,1056,"right on, I am sure that will prove to be a great fishing machine for you..can you smell the musky snot on the carpet already?"
307163,irishfield,2009-02-16 23:49:00,26272,But Lew... is it riveted or welded?  Congrats fella.. looks like a nice ride and good to see you've reached my age and need a windshield and top ! lol  That 80lb will be plenty misfish! My 75 motorguide pulls my boat at 4.7MPH !
307165,2 tone z71,2009-02-16 23:55:00,1311,Very Very Very Nice Lew congrats thats figgin awesome
307166,Greencoachdog,2009-02-16 23:55:00,8163,That's a heckuva beautiful boat Lew!!!... Congratulations!!!   ... can I borrow it?
307169,fishdawg,2009-02-17 00:01:00,912,right on Lew I guess you have secured a spot to keep it close to home after the trailer closes?
307172,kickingfrog,2009-02-17 00:06:00,8333,Nice! You'll be able to slalom really well behind that thing.
