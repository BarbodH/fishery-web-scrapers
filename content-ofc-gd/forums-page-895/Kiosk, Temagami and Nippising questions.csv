Looking for a spot to park my truck and walk out, the only spot I have bin on is Nip on Callander bay the others I have not even been to yet, I dont want your honey holes lol just curious I would like to go out somewhere new tommorow and wonder if I can just park and walk to fish, info mainly wanted for kiosk and temagami   Thanks guys  Nelson"
307035,irishfield,2009-02-16 18:31:00,26272,Nelson.. Temagami.. you can either hit the Lake Temagami Access road to the hub and drive out on the ice road that goes all the way to Bear Island.. or go to town and drive out the packed path from the boat ramp and follow to it becomes plowed to at least my place and probably down to at least Island 27. Just be sure to go a GOOD distance from the road before drilling any holes to fish.  Also many lakes right along #11 that you could park and walk out onto them.
