307105,diggyj,2009-02-16 22:13:00,548,"Personally I don't think the Cumara rods are worth the extra money. Nothing wrong with Shimano's Crucial line up of rods. They are awsome. Graet bang for the buck, lifetime warranty, what more do you want.  Dirk..."
307284,JPD,2009-02-17 03:33:00,296,"Hi workwear,  I have been fortunate enough to use the Cumara's for the past year and I can't say enough about them. The difference between the Crucial and the Cumara is quite a bit. The guides are SIC rather than Alconite, the blanks are lighter and more sensitive being IM-10 rather than IM-9, the split grip high density foam and custom handles are a dream to handle as well. The best part being that they both have a lifetime warranty.  They are one of the best I have fished with and unless you are looking for a big flipping stick which they do not have in that line up I would not hesitate to try them.  If your need to now about specific actions or lengths please feel free to ask.  JP"
