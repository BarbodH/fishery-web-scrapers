307922,legacey,2009-02-18 20:53:00,127,"I had the same problem with posting my recent vacation pics. (user legacey69)  Spent a while compiling the pictures and sound. Uploaded it and 24 hours later received an email that it contained copywritten music. The band was Squirrel Nut Zippers if anyone has heard of them.....too bad, it fit perfectly.  First I get banned by Metalica on Napster, now them....I can't win!  I guess I'll have to record some  I've since heard Youtube and the music industry are in a battle and they will now remove your audio.  Good luck.  Paul"
