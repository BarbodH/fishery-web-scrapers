307274,Jet,2009-02-17 03:08:00,364,"Got skunked too, from Dave's huts. Others got skunked too. A few got 1 to 4 fish, but only a few.  I marked fish throughout the day, not a lot but a decent amount. Many chased my spoon between 3 and 8 feet, the turned back. Happened on four occasions.  Interesting thing, the ice was cracking all day long which tested the nerves of many. On the way back there was a huge crack line near shore on the north side of Georgina Island that loosened up a car sized slab of ice. Luckily Dave's guys are very conscious and noticed the crack before driving over it and marked it off. It went from one end almost to the other. Any unlucky vehicle would have went in if they didn't see it first. It was bad enough that we had to walk to shore."
