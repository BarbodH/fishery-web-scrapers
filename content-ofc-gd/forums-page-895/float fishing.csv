264668,wuchikubo,2008-11-04 21:20:00,1114," Don't know if it's older than dirt, but my the looks of it you may be able to do some carbon dating on it!! LOL  Actually, looking at it again, keep the set up as it is and bring it to the next antique roadshow. I have a couple of fly reels, but don't look anything like that one."
264671,blaque,2008-11-04 21:44:00,2419," Its got character is all, its very interesting blowing the dust off stuff like this"
264672,Paulus,2008-11-04 21:45:00,522,"Do you think you can try macro setting in the daylight, with flash off? Your pics will come out clearer. If there are some connoisseurs on the board, they might also be able to tell you if you have a collector's item there...  No doubt about it being a fly fishing setup, though. For float fishing, you will be forced to pony up some dough...  p.-  p.s. macro setting is the one that looks like a little flower. It's the same on all cameras.  "
264679,solopaddler,2008-11-04 21:58:00,8605,"Yes the tackle is a fly rod/reel, and frankly not worth spending your money in IMO.  The reel is kind of interesting. The small lever sticking out in front leads me to believe it's an automatic reel. If so there'd be a knob on the backplate that you wind up and then pull the lever up to retrieve line. They were a true oddity back in the day, never really catching on with anglers..."
264683,GBW,2008-11-04 22:19:00,8460,"Thanks Pualus about the pic info, so with that said here is the new pic's as I deleted the old ones.      let me know what you know about this when you can, thanks!! Geoff"
264684,GBW,2008-11-04 22:21:00,8460,"PS, solo, how old are you talking when you say back in the day? I'm not after money for this is anyway as it's not mine.  I want to know more about it and if I can use it today...  Thanks again all. Geoff"
264703,dannyboy,2008-11-04 23:21:00,367,"It cleaned up nice. Multiplier fly reel and Mitchell fly rod, the reels were imported by L M Dickson (on the reel) from France in the late 1950s to 1960s and carried by many sporting stores. Very useable for fly fishing. You will probably need to replace the fly line and backing if it is the same vintage. The reel may not carry enough line if you hook into a good sized steelhead.  If you want to float fish you will need to look into getting a different rig, a basic centerpin reel and rod can set you back over $250 though. I already had a decent baitcast reel, so I bought a cheap ($50) 13 foot baitcast float rod, a couple floats, hooks, small swivels, split shot (without the wings), roe bags and I went float fishing.  Dan"
264716,TerryC,2008-11-05 00:04:00,196,"I learned a valuable lesson today regarding float reels, I fished the whirlpool in Niagara for about 5 hours today, with a spinning reel. I was fishing some really good drifts and was taking note of the other anglers around me. I watched about 15 steelies caught today and every fish caught was of of a float reel set up. I fished the exact same baits Roe and small worms and caught nothing. Eventually I broke down the rod and spent about an hour watching the float reel guys and it was quite evident that their drifts were way more natural looking. I also will be asking Santa for a new float set up. Good luck with the new equipment."
264751,GBW,2008-11-05 02:23:00,8460,"Wow, thanks Dan. Do you know any place in the GTA East end where I can get the reel cleaned up and serviced?  Or is it not worth it and the basic clean up that I have done should be good...  What I would like to know is how to work the drag system on this reel as i was tinkering with it and I think the drag may be shot because of being left on full force (I think) for so many years in storage. Funny thing though, the line looks to be only a few years old as it is still bright and strong.  I grabbed a section and gave it a few solid tugs and there was no give or breakage.  Either way, I'll replace the line... Any other comments are welcome as well, I thank you all. Geoff"
264841,dannyboy,2008-11-05 15:45:00,367,"Your reel may have drag in the form of that little copper coloured star under the handle you may be able to carefully reform it, keeping in mind it may have hardened over time.  Many fly reels don't have drag; just a clicker and you can also supply the drag to the spool or line with your hand.  Servicing should be easy as there are not too many moving parts, if you are comfortable do it yourself; get an old white sheet, good light source and decent tools. Use your newly found camera skills and take pictures of every step of disassembly, lay out the parts in order of removal. Carefully wipe off any old grease and replace with a small amount of grease - remember if you can see the grease it isn't doing anything other than collecting dirt.  If the line is in good shape and has no cracks it should be fine, you may need to unspool it and put it in a tub of warm water to get the curl out of it.  While you unspool it take notice if there is any taper to the line - fly lines come in many different configurations.  If the line diameter doesn't change over the length of the line it is a level line which is more challenging to learn to cast with. HIH Dan"
264933,GBW,2008-11-05 22:01:00,8460,thanks for the reply Dan.  Looks like I'll be doing some tinkering soon...  cheers. Geoff

262563,GBW,2008-10-28 14:05:00,8460,Hi all.  Well with all these threads on float fishing and some real nice pic's you have got me wanting to give it a try.  So my questions to all you float fishers out there is how often do you need to replace the floating line (main line?)?  What's good to use for line(s)?  I have access to a float set up but neither my father nor I know how old the set up is and how old the line is.  We don't even know where the rod and reel came from as I asked him and he doesn't know.  I just know I can get it from the cottage in 2 weekends when I go up.  Any tip's on how to loop/cast with one properly?  I can watch video's till my eyes bleed if need be.  Or if anyone is willing to teach a not so old dog a new trick I would be thankful.  Cheers.  Geoff
262569,kemper,2008-10-28 14:16:00,2232,"If you dont know how old it is, you are going to want to replace the line for sure. I like the Raven bright pink line, seems to float well (for a while, then it collects water and sinks like a rock) and it tough as nails. Im sure others will have their own opinions on the line though.  As for casting learning the side cast is super easy and simple to do when its cold out and your hands are frozen, just watch a video you will pick it up in no time.  It will twist your line though so learning a spinning cast is a bonus"
262577,Greencoachdog,2008-10-28 14:28:00,8163,I think you can do the same thing with a cane pole and a cork!
262579,KelfuN,2008-10-28 14:31:00,246,"i just started float fishing maybe 1 month ago, so don't count on me 100%..lol  i run 10lb siglon F main line..using a swivel, i tie a 6lb siglon FC leader about 18-24'' long depending on the situation. i then put shots gradually down from my float to the swivel (no shots on my leader). and i ONLY use no. 6 shots, i believe they are 0.105grams. 90% time i use the 2.0gram blackbird float since its a good all around float for slow to medium current. as for casting, just watch some videos on youtube and you'll learn in no time. one thing i realized is that after a cast, i have to guide my line back to my pin in order to have a smooth drift."
262582,GBW,2008-10-28 14:47:00,8460,"thanks guys, any more comments are very welcome. Kemper, do you think Gangon's is going to be my best bet for a good deal around here?"
262605,kemper,2008-10-28 15:16:00,2232,"Yep, just let them know you are getting into float fishing and they will help you out."
262612,GBW,2008-10-28 15:29:00,8460,thanks Kemper.

262668,kentooley,2008-10-28 17:39:00,208, No problem...Those Ohio boys are a good bunch. I invited them up here for some steelheading and Swatskee is setting up the details for a road trip in Nov or Dec. If you or anyone else is interested let me know.
262676,GBW,2008-10-28 17:49:00,8460,"Me, HAHAHA.  I would just slow everyone down asking for help, tip's and tricks when it comes to float fishing...  but thanks."
262714,bigredfisher,2008-10-28 18:58:00,300,"the best thing that you can do is walk down to any river and watch what other people are doing, you will learn fast that way but be sure to check 1. how far away from the hook is their last shot 2. how many shot they have on their lead ( i like to run 2 small ones 3. the size of their float 4. amount of shot under their float 5. the weight of their float and remember you need different leads for different baits ie... roe i use a shorter lead and for pink worms i use a long lead. hope this helps !!!!!!! thanks bigredfisher"
262765,spooner_jr,2008-10-28 21:28:00,193,"GBW:  Unless you are planning to drive a fair bit, the creeks in your area aren't real wide, so you don't need to worry about the line ""floating"".  Just make sure the reel will turn easily, that is the main advantage to a float reel;  you can continue a straight drift beyond where a spinning reel will let you go.  As far as casting goes, its like backing up a trailer, you can get an idea from a video but you need to practice."
262772,Paulus,2008-10-28 21:43:00,522,"i use raven 10lb mainline green (cheeeeep and strong) and ""phantom"" (by redwing) fluorocarbon leader. i also use riverwood balsa floats, most of the time.  i agree with all the other comments & can add that the best part is when the float goes down  whatever pain you go through with this new discipline, keep dropping us the odd post & we will help. but it's worth learning the skill if only to see that float go down and have it come trailing a bright chrome steelhead  post a pic of your stuff once you've retrieved it. we can tell you what it is you've got!  and finally, welcome and good luck!  p.-"
262821,GBW,2008-10-28 23:39:00,8460,"thanks all! do you find that on a short float in the tight areas that you can just use mono as your main line with a good fluoro leader?  I'm thinking like an 8LB or 10LB good mono as the main if that will work.  I'll post a pic or few for you when I get my hands on the set up just so you can help me out with things (thanks in advance) as well as give me any idea of the age of this gear.  thanks again all and I'm willing to get out there and give it a shot any time I can.  With that said, I must talk to the wife and see what plans we have for us and the kids...  Cheers!  Geoff"
262856,Paulus,2008-10-29 00:33:00,522, Yes  p.-
262902,spooner_jr,2008-10-29 01:46:00,193,Just remember to put some kind of backing on the reel before filling it with mono.  It's cheaper and takes up more space.  You can also check out www.floatfishing.net
262907,silvio,2008-10-29 02:03:00,433,Post pics of the setup when you get it. Once you get it shoot me a pm and all help you out all pm you my phone number and walk you through the process of setup and rigging. I must warn you float fishing is an incurable disease.
262930,GBW,2008-10-29 03:14:00,8460,"Ah HA, good to hear!  TKS, as I have a low cost but good mono I use as backing now on all my other spinning and baitcasting reeels.  pic's will be added as soon as I get the set up home.  I'll PM all that are willing to help me out as it's in MY best interest to take any help offered.  So you will be hearing from me... Oh and don't you mean ANY fishing is an incurable disease?  It sure is for me, Bass, walleye, pike, panfish and now MORE!    I swear I had golf clubs not to long ago but they must have gotten lost by all this fishing gear..."
262932,kennyman,2008-10-29 03:20:00,737,WOW. What a great link. Thankyou very much for that! That should keep me busy for a while.
264604,GBW,2008-11-04 16:17:00,8460,"Ok, so I got the rod and reel the other day and I'll post pic's soon.  Here is what it is. Rod: 8'6"" Ranger by Mitchell R85 with AFTMA 7-8 printed on it. Reel: (I might have the spelling worng because of the font used) Lm Dichsovy, #106 MAGINOT. Is this any good?  I think the reel might be pooched, is there a place in Durham that can service it at a fair price?  Thanks folks. Geoff"
264624,dannyboy,2008-11-04 18:21:00,367,"It sounds like it is a fly rod and reel, just as addicting but a little different than a float rig. Will know better when you post a picture.  Dan"

264631,GBW,2008-11-04 18:54:00,8460,"Thanks guys, as I'm new to this type of rod and reel I wasn't sure.   yeah, how so?  I know it may look older then dirt, so is it older then dirt?  HAHA"
