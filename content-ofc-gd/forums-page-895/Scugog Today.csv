Sure a change since the last time...all hard surface, no snow and solid ice  Tried a different spot today as it was easier to walk/slide further out.  Had a few solid hits but unable to hook any   starting to think Scugog doesn't like me  Spoke with some locals moving their hut...walleye was good last few days.    Good 16 inches of ice on average where I was today.  Lots of people out, cars, trucks & ATV's.    Not sure when I will get the chance to go out again but I am hoping it will be somewhere else."

307582,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-17 23:41:00,260, Rub it in!  Was nice just to get out...even if I had to go work on Family Day  Whats a holiday?
