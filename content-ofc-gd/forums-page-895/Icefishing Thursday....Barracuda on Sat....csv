307765,iceslayer,2009-02-18 12:46:00,97,Felt crazy to be ice fishing one day and then targeting these monster just a couple of day's later.   First for me but wont be the last.  What a fight.   Jim  
307801,Greencoachdog,2009-02-18 14:34:00,8163,"Nice fish and I'll bet you had a great time catching them... but you really shouldn't keep those big 'Cudas like that.  They can be pretty poisonous to eat, Ciguatera is cumulative in the fish and the people that eat them!!!  Cigautera"
307804,snag,2009-02-18 14:40:00,1932,"Wow GCD,  Never knew that!  Iceslayer,  Make some local cats happy! Save yourself!"
307814,Leecher,2009-02-18 14:59:00,7832,Awesome Jim Bet it gave ya a huge rush of adrenaline catching them cudas  Thanks for sharing Leechman
307815,Zubris21,2009-02-18 15:04:00,563,Nice looking fish!  Hopefully in March I'll be able to make my way south for something similar!
307816,tinbanger,2009-02-18 15:05:00,1028,Must have been a blast ! thanks for posting ...any pics of the action from the boat ?  TB
307822,johnnyb,2009-02-18 15:24:00,3413,"Yeah, barracudas are pretty awesome to reel in...and the small ones are super tasty...but GCD is right...the big ones can be bad for you.  MEt a guy in Bahamas who got sick 3 times...but he says they taste so good he can't turn 'em down   I enjoyed a few small ones, and they are delicious!"
307827,highdrifter,2009-02-18 15:36:00,2534,Classic Canary scenario..  I say feed em to the cat first..  If the cat doesn't go blind after a couple hours..  Have yourself a cuda feast!!  cheers HD
307845,iceslayer,2009-02-18 17:01:00,97,  We did'nt keep them but the guides do anyway.  They say they give to local villiges.......  We figured they would sell them.  Either way....What a fight!
