306281,Chris,2009-02-14 12:36:00,405,"cram  The above is a great example of how out of touch with reality most government union workers have become. I have four siblings, all of whom have government jobs. My brother is retiring this March at 53 years old with 75% of the average of his highest paying 5 years pay as his retirement salary. My sister (a teacher) will retire earlier than him, but she refuses to discuss her retirement details, saying she is embarrassed to talk about it. I have another sister who started out in the same line of work as myself, only her career was at National Defense. I have worked hard and started a small business and work twice her hours yet she makes roughly 25K more per year with a full benefits package. Her whole department has Wednesday afternoons off....it's time alotted for exercising in the gym they have at work, yet nobody uses it, they just go home and get paid for sitting on their arses. All four of them think that their retirement packages and pay scales are typical of the private sector wages and benefits. I will be working til the day I day to make ends meet and you know what their response is when this is brought up??? If you don't like the job you're in, get a job in the publis sector. Can you imagine if everyone went to work for the government? Who would generate an economy.  As far as teachers paying for supplies out of their own pocket......nonsense. We are given a list of supplies that WE are responsible to send to my child's school at the start of every year. Those supplies are way more than one child will ever use in one year and they go into a general ""kitty"" and are distributed, supposedly by the teachers. Yeah my parents bought me supplies at the beginning of each year but it was at their discretion. Now they give you a list and tell you it's what you're gonna buy.  To the person who compared teachers unions to automotive workers getting a bailout. Are you for real??? Last time I looked teachers were not losing their jobs.  In fact, at the same time enrollment is declining and schools are being closed, we are hiring more teachers. But that dosn't surprise me. When I went to school we had over 30 kids in each class. What are they down to now? It's hard to keep track when the class sizes are decresing every year.  Yeah it would make sense that the ones supporting striking teachers are teachers themselves (or spouses or relatives of a teacher). But let's look at some of the arguements. There is talk of all the hard work, education and money spent to become a teacher. So what's the point??? Everyone with a decent job had to work, go to school and spend money to get there. I know lots of people who put in extra hours, many times with no compensation. They too have a choice.....stay or find a better job. Every year, actual teaching time is decreasing. Every year my daughter goes on a field trip to Upper Canada Village. She's sick of seeing the same thing there every year. It seems like every week there is a day off for something, teacher prep time, courses, parent/teacher interviews, etc. etc. There was a ski trip last week, we chose to let our daughter stay home and actually learn something. Snow days haha.....when I was a kid there had to be four feet of snow before they would call a snow day. Now it only has to be in the forecast and the kids are home for the day. Have the teacher's unions every considered the hardships that families with two working parents have when they still have to drive thru that snow to get to work, while the schools are ""off"" and trying to figure out what to do with their children for the day??? Or during a strike???  Just out of curiosity......to the teacher who turned down the two higher paying jobs.....what were those two jobs and how much did they pay???  The propaganda being spread by most government unions these days (has anyone heard ""it's not about the money, it's about dignity and respect"" lately) may have worked in the dark ages, but people have the internet now and the truth is readily available. Spreading the same old tired propaganda not only makes you look bad, but in this day and age people are onto the games these unions play. You don't demand respect, you earn it. As far as dignity.....I wouldn't have any either if I carried myself the way some teachers do. Enough said!!!  Be happy that you have a job in these uncertain times and teach our kids and for god's sake and stop the whining, you have it darn good. No sympathy here for the teachers union."

306307,Cudz,2009-02-14 14:14:00,2652,I guess you are referring to me. I lived in Dubai for 8 years Just as it was growing.  I was offered one job in eral estate as the markets wre just opening to foreigners.  My friend took the same job and is now set for life.  He has made welol over $3 million. Second job was in the same place but had to do with a Canadian company that sets up fire safety/hazmat instruction for the government.  I would have been a partner. Both my friends who are the managing partners in the company make well over 6 figures each year.
306362,Cookslav,2009-02-14 17:28:00,1457," Yes but this ""more funding"" is not for the students supplies per say...its to hire 1,500 more teachers to lighten the work load more then anything....The main issue for teachers is not salaries this is true, its about the work load.  Sure more teachers lowers class sizes, and lightens the load...some would agree thats needed(myself included) But why not threaten a strike based on THAT? Why hide the agenda in a mass coverall clause of ""funding for students"" There is something a bit shady about the way it all went down if you ask me. I for one will be watching to see how many new teachers are actually hired in the next 4 years, and see what pay increases are handed out  so the next time a strike talk comes up...I know were the line is.  The unions Stance here(hidden agendas and all) is laid out like this... It is about a $711 per student funding gap between elementary and high schools in Ontario. Sorry but I'm not sure a Junior kindergarden through grade 8 student needs as much cash for supplies then say...a grade 9 through 12 highschool shop, music, science, art, or biology Student? A saxaphone costs a bit more money then say...Paper and paste. That just seems like an unrealistic margin to bridge? Unless of course you mention that $700 of that funding is going towards hireing new teachers, and building new schools to lighten the work load. The teachers union needs to invest in Public relations rep LOL! People might atually buy into what they are selling if they present it better, but of course the union doesn't want to be on the stick for actually Spending the way they said they would....They just want the funding.  The sad Fact is they ""were"" offered an $800-million deal that would have given teachers a 12 per cent pay raise over four years which supposedly wasn't enough To bridge that gap AND hire more teachers to lighten the load, so it was not accepted...in retrospect that was a HUGE mistake now that the econmoy tanked, and those funding are no longer available.  All I know is the pulic will be watching closely now... This whole little ugly mess left a bad taste in our mouths, and I hope there are 1500 teachers hired, schools built, and no talk of strikes for the next 4 years.    http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/sto...gam_mostdiscuss"
306383,cram,2009-02-14 19:21:00,1733,"  Long post, but you're basically arguing my point.  Funding for students may indeed mean for hiring teachers to reduce class size (i don't know), but the point is they presumably gave up larger personal gains in income to provide more funding.  The paper and paste you refer to --- wouldn't it be nice if the school could pay for it instead of the teachers out of their own pockets?"
306384,cram,2009-02-14 19:27:00,1733," I have many friends who are teachers (probably not a surprise) and i can tell you --- much of what is used in the classroom comes out of their own pockets.   Maybe your school board (or individual school) has a better system.  Its not hte case where my friends teach.   That part more than anythign disgusts me.  As for the raise...it basically matches historical inflation.  Most people's salaries match inflation.  And, everyone says ""if you don't like it get another job"".....well, they didn't liek it and did something about it.   I have no problem with that.   Keep in mind that with the union structure there are no options for good teachers to get paid more than the crappy ones either.  Just as it lifts some weak people up, it holds some strong ones down.  I for one would LOVE a free market.  The good ones would get paid more, and would have more optoins when they're paid unfairly.  I think what you should be arguing against is there being a union....not teachers wanting more (salary matched to inflation...what greedy people).  btw - the auto companies took $4B out of our pocket this year to keep paying lien workers 140k.  I personally have no problme paying 700mm to pay the teachers of my kids an average of 71k (+2.5% per year)"

306610,Cookslav,2009-02-15 04:09:00,1457, Pretty sure most of it is? Do they not have a budget? I know my daughter teachers complain about it not being enough so I assume there is a limited budget. Maybe not enough for some...maybe adequet for others?  I guess its subjective to the lessons.
306624,cram,2009-02-15 04:25:00,1733," You mean that you assume most of it is, because that would make sense.  I did as well.  If your daughter is in elementary school, next time you visit ask the teacher what in the classroom was paid for by the school/board and what was paid for by him/her.  You'll be surprised.  Maybe its just peel region, but i doubt it."
306699,boatman,2009-02-15 14:52:00,350," Now that is an educated post. Average salary for a teacher is more than $60K, but much less than $92.  People may get into teaching for the love of the work, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be compensated for it. If you do a job you deserved to be fairly compensated. I'm not commenting on whether they make too much or not enough. I will say that the government workers, at least those below management do not make huge amounts of money. I know some government workers and they don't make that much at all. I know trades people, farmers and retail employees that make more.  Either way, I can understand people being upset by teacher strikes or strikes in general. I for one am no fan of unions. However, without a union government employees would see little in way of compensation. The union agrees on terms that span 3-5 years and after that period have to renegotiate the contract. Money is usually the smallest part of the contract. In fact, the money portion usually only covers inflation. I know some government employees that won a contract in the early 90's and then the government said ""forget it"", legislated the workers back to work and then cancelled the contract. Those same employees went without a contract or wage increase for 10 YEARS. That means they effectively took a paycut every year for 10 years. To put that into perspective, with the rate of inflation if they made $40,000 in 1998 they still made $40K in 2008 instead of the $53,000 they needed to make just to stay on parr. How many of you would go 10 years without a pay raise?  Like many of you, I too have struggled to make ends meet. I've worked terrible jobs just make less than minimum wage and been glad for the work. However, I'd never bash someone for trying to get ahead or at least just hang onto what they have.  Also, teachers pay taxes, too. They pay for their jobs as much as we do."

Now he laughs at me every time I see him. He truly was smart and I was the idiot.

I don't even want to talk about his ridiculous sick days allowed. I'll work a 10 hour day, sometimes 6 days a week and often don't stop longer than 5 minutes for lunch.

305973,snookey318,2009-02-13 16:13:00,9,"""Those who can do, and those who cannot teach"" very truthfull saying in my book. Unfortunately the Ontario taxpayer is being held hostage by one of the strongest unions in the country who manage to get a 10% raise when others are just fighting for there jobs being there the next day.  I was dating a teacher in Toronto earlier this year and she would work a six hour day (when she didnt call in sick) and get the usual 2.5 months holidays and yet still recieve $82,000 a year. If she worked during the summer you can image what here final income would be for the year. Her idea of stress was 7 year olds not listening in class. Thats terrible, what about the real world where you have to PERFORM and answer to your boss on a daily basis or you will be fired. Whats troublesome is that this group seem to think they are entitled to yearly increases just because their union has the public by the balls.  Reality check: Teachers are like a jack of all trades, if they didnt teach they certainly WOULD NOT earn $100,000 a year in another career field. 100K is a lot of money that should be a result of HARD WORK or a skill set in high demand. I think many would agree with me that most teachers do not possess or demonstrate either of these traits.  Didnt Reagan fire all of the striking air traffic controllers in the 80's?"
305975,cram,2009-02-13 16:25:00,1733,"  Snookey -- i'm assuming you don't have kids, right?  btw - average is 71k, not 100.  Headhunter -- do most of the teachers show up 15 mins before and leave 15 mins after?"
305984,snookey318,2009-02-13 16:41:00,9,  Actually two young boys that take a lot of my time and money but their great.
305985,albany_guide,2009-02-13 16:41:00,23,"  Well that is just an indication of ignorance right there.  I have taught in elementary, secondary, and am currently teaching at a college.  How about you?  Any teaching experience or are you just talking out of your arse?  Just one example....try setting up multiple bulletin boards in a classroom every week using students work...since manufactured products are now frowned upon.  See how long that takes.  Having taught a number of grades all the way through the system, including post secondary, I can tell you that preparing an effective lesson, evaluating student progress, maintianing a bright, visual classroom conducive to learning, and other demands of the profession for elementary teachers are not less time consuming than secondary.  People assume they know what it takes to be a teacher since they went through the education system.  That's like me saying I know what it's like to be a bank manager since I'm a customer of the bank.  Experiencing the product of a profession does not indicate an understanding of what that profession entails.  People need to educate themselves and quit assuming they know what it's like to do someone else's job."
305989,Headhunter,2009-02-13 16:47:00,5703,"Cram, I know where you are going with this and I agree with you... most Teachers do go beyond the required by law hours... however, many don't. If you recall from my earlier post, from yesterday, I started off by saying that most Teachers are good at what they do! However, like most things in life, it's the few who don't contribute that require the lion's share of the adminstrators' time. Just to clarify my position... I have met with and spoken to many excellent teachers who I would not hesitate to bring my kids to... however I have also encountered too many who are simply not in it for the right reasons. It certainly does take the ""right"" kind of person to be a strong teacher, unfortunately the one who aren't and have no intension of ever being more than they are now, are protected by the union. It paints a bad picture for the rest of the group. My beef is with the union and their protect the employee at any cost attitude. Too many useless people in a profession that has no real accountability or ramifications for incompetance. And don't forget the sense of entitlement that so many have! HH"
305991,cram,2009-02-13 16:51:00,1733," So if you value your kids education, and teachers are such morons, did you pull your kids out of the public system and put them in private school?  Or home school?"
305993,cram,2009-02-13 16:56:00,1733," I get that.  Unions are crap.  I so prefer a free market.   Not sure how it works in that profession though.....you'd have good teachers earning more and crappy teachers earning less (all good things), but you'd also have good teachers aggregating on good neighbourhoods and leaving the less desirable ones.  Curious - what does your wife think about the extra funding for students?  I assume she can't be steamed about that."
305994,snookey318,2009-02-13 16:57:00,9," Of course I do.  I believe that a teacher who is payed a maximum of $55,000 a year can provide the same proper education to my children that a $80,000 (sorry, $90,000 in 4 years) teacher has the ability too."
305995,dp3200,2009-02-13 16:58:00,31,"  I believe the issue that most people have is with teachers striking if they don't get what they want when everyone else understands that if you want more, you should just work harder, become more qualified, choose another profession, etc. Some examples that are offered seem to make it pretty obvious that there is a lot of room for teachers to do so if they wish, but they don't. At least that is my issue with it. It has nothing to do with ""Envy"".  There is a serious problem with the sense of entitlement that some people have - if you don't get what you want, you find another job or you suck it up. If teaching was an unfair profession, nobody would do it. The fact that people do it and they don't go find something better is because what they are getting is fair.  I don't care if teachers work 5, 40 or 100 hours a week. I just think that they should be paid based on what the market for their skills and outputs determine, and not what some over-powered union demands."
305999,cram,2009-02-13 17:06:00,1733," If teachers are such morons and you do value your kids education you should pull them out of the public system and put them in private or homeschool.  btw -- 90k is for maximum tenure and maximum upgrading (taking courses through thsummer etc).  The average is 71.     I bet most teachers in their 30's are making 60-70k, after 4 years of university and 1 yr of teachers college.  We just gave $4B to the auto industry to pay guys who are making 140k for standing on a line (i have lots of friends in teh auto industry, and even they say they're overpaid), yet everyone's belly-aching over 700mm (1/6th what we paid the autoworkers), most of which IS BEING APPLIED TO STUDENT FUNDING, NOT TEACHERS.  These are your kids, and your neighbours kids, and your brother/sister's kids.  You probably spent more on beer last year than you did on school tax."
306000,cram,2009-02-13 17:07:00,1733, How do you find the *market value*?  If you look at private schools are the teachers makign more or less?
306006,dp3200,2009-02-13 17:25:00,31,"  The same way that millions of other wages are determined. Pay whatever it takes to get enough qualified teachers. If salaries were too high you would have more teachers than jobs, and if they were too low there wouldn't be enough teachers to go around.  I know someone that was making $150K as a IT project manager back in the dot com boom because the industry exploded and there weren't enough people with experience to go around. The ridiculous salaries caused a huge flood of people to get into computers, and now he can't even seem to find a job that he wants. Does anyone want to go into computers now? Not really...at least it's nowhere near as attractive as it was a decade ago. The supply-demand relationship balanced out at about $100K for what he does, and he doesn't go on strike about it.  I'm not saying teachers are overworked, overpaid or otherwise - I'm saying that people earn what they are worth until a union gets involved."
306007,cram,2009-02-13 17:32:00,1733," So accomodate the lowest common denominator.   I would prefer a free market, but the free market means you get to negotiate your own contract.  So, if you're a good/great teacher you get to earn more than the average.  It would be an interesting situation.  btw - I can tell you from first hand experience that the tech market the past 3 years has been as good or better (for the IT guys) than the dot-com boom you're referring to.  If you remove the Y2K contracts the market is actually bigger than it was back then."
306015,Headhunter,2009-02-13 18:45:00,5703,"Cram, my wife and I have been putting serious thought into putting our kids into private school. There are a number of reasons for this, but unfortunately, financially, right now, it would be financial suicide for us.  RE: the tech market... well I have some personal experience in that market Let me just say that salaries and hourly rates have dropped in I.T., but really only in the last 6 months or so. That market is really all about riding the next technilogical wave and being at the crest of that wave, at the right time. The folks I know in the industry are folks who stay ahead of the game by staying educated and current. I know people making $100/hr and I know people making $15/hr. They are worth every penny a company will pay them or they wouldn't get it! HH"
306018,snookey318,2009-02-13 18:49:00,9," I never said teachers were morons. I am saying that they are overpaid for the work they perform because of their unions stanglehold on our citizens and government.  You keep on mentioning averages. The fact is that with any unionized government job you will be making the MAXIMUM allowable after working for awhile. If you screw up in your job, dont matter. Increase is coming. The issue with paying teachers so much is that it comes out of our paycheck in the form of taxes. Something is wrong when the average home in TO is paying over $4000 a year in taxes. Not everyone is ""entitled"" to the yearly increases and feels the affects of a high tax burden.  Yes my kids education is important but they can recieve the quality instruction they need if teachers were paid less. To be honest, I dont recall being impressed by many teachers from primary school to university. They regurgitate material from a book and right it on the board. Great way to stimulate young minds.  Yes there are some good teachers but many bad ones as well who go into it for the summer vacation,big bucks, and lack of accountability."

I like teaching.  I like the kids.  It keeps me young and in the know.  I like the fact that I can enpower a generation and help to them to participate in society effectively.  I try to teach them life-lessons, morals and values as well as the curriculum.  Not all are successful but the vast majority are.  I believe that I am a role model and I believe I do a good job.  The job, like any other, has its ups and downs but the positives far outweigh the negatives.  I am not ashamed of being a teacher.  I am proud of it. Believe it or not, not everyone can be a teacher.  Some of you naysayers think it is just the easiest job in the world.  I will tell you this; there are some people in 'your real world' who wouldn't last a semester in my 'fake world (I guess that is what it must be??)'  Just makes me laugh.  Oh yeah.  I do teach because I love it.  I get paid well but I don't really care about that.  My wife and I in the years coming up to 2003 were financial very stable.  My wife decided to stay at home with the kids for the past 5 years.  I am not a top level earning teacher and I have 3 children.  I get paid well but not crazy amounts of money.  If I wanted more money I would quit being a teacher and find another job.  I am confident I could do that but I live a comfortable life without much luxury (have you seen my boat?  I share it with a friend and got it and everything in it for free).  I do admit a good chunk of your taxes go to education.  I don't believe teachers should ever strike or complain about their wages.  I think if you talk to teachers you will find that there are very very few who think they are underpaid.  Would I take a pay cut in times like these;  YES I would. For those of you who don't like the way teacher's teach, here is what you can do.  1. go to university and get a degree 2. go to university for a 5th year after being at the top or near the top of your undergrad class (this is called teacher's college and only high achieversr make it in) 3. Get on a school board list and supply teach for at least 2 years or so and do a few LTOs along the way. 4. get a contract to work (You will probably only start with a 1/6 contract and work your way up from there to 6/6 or full contract which often take 2 plus years) 5. Once you have a contract, do all kinds of university courses in order to become a high level teacher (each course costs $800 and I have taken 6 so far and am not at top level).  By this point you still might be making $45K.  so it really isn't that difficult.  Any takers?  Should only cost you about $70-80K to become a teacher."

Strikes are ridiculous IMO  Teachers got it good...sorry but its 100% true Not saying its easy by any means, and I'm not saying it was not earned but lets review the facts.  Great pay consistently over the national average Great job security Weekends off, and reasonable hours Great...and I mean GREAT Pension plan and benefits and more time off then pretty much any industry I can think of.  It ain't easy I'm sure (lots of opinions out there on that) but its better then many, or most have it right now, and that's why there was so little public support for this ""near"" strike. The whole idea was not in touch with today's reality, or Public empathy.  If they were not happy that Highschool teachers get more perks...then go teach in highschool? Gosh it seems odd that a dullard like me should half to point out such a simplistic & reasonable solution to the elite minds of our educational system LOL!"

305436,hotrod,2009-02-12 17:42:00,103,"The problem the teachers face is in the court of public opinion and unfortunately for them most of us went through the public system and experienced first hand all the dead wood that exists, it's not about how the media reports it. Like any union the dead wood can never be removed and keeps piling up.  Another problem is the politicization of the classroom particularly during a strike which in my opinion does not belong there. People send their kids to school to learn how to read and write and not be indoctrined with the political philosophy of the teachers who have a captive audience.  I also don't understand how a public school child would demand the same resources, prep time and funding that a high school kid would. To me it is a smokescreen that people are seeing right through. I feel most teachers are held hostage by the union heads as was said in earlier posts most would have taken the original deal. To strike now will cause outrage among the public."

I know it was and it's still going on. So are you saying a grade 1 teacher needs the same prep to teach abc's as a calculus teacher? How about some numbers on how much the teachers fork out of their pocket. If I need a tool or some workclothes should that come out of my pocket or my employers?"

Not clothes.  If you need tools, then yes -- i'd say they should come out of your employer's pocket OR be tax deductible.  The money you spent on them should not be considered income.  If you're a tradesperson i bet that's the case, right??  Prep time -- i don't even really know what that is.  Time off between periods?  As for funding -- just do what i said.  Ask the teacher.  I did.  Its pretty scary.   You'd likely find that 75% of the stuff in an elementary classroom was paid for by the teacher out of her pocket....including the books.   I personally have no problem funding my kids' education.   Esp when - as muddler pointed out - we're paying our teachers less than daycare babysitters."
305444,Grimace,2009-02-12 18:13:00,2020,"If you want to know where all your tax dollars are.   Ask a doctor. They over book, rush you out of their office so they can jam the next appointment in ( more appointments more minimum charges per appointment).    But that is small game, the Hospitals are raking it in.   Overcharging the government for everything, they don't even have to give you a bill stating what they are charging the government for.   So they can give you one thing drive up the bill for service fees for this and that and the government believes them because there word is bond.  Hospitals always cry poor, lets have another community event of executive dinner to fund our new dialysis machine.   Your donations, guess what.   Tax deductible.  But it is a necessary evil.  If the government stops letting the hospitals and doctors rip them (us) off, they will just go to the states and rip off the insurance companies off, the insurance companies get sick of it and stop covering things, this hurts the people.   Kind of what our dentists do here, but just like in Hammy Hamster.  That is another story.  A busy Doctors office will charge more to the government in one week than the government funds a classroom including teacher in a year.  Canadians pick up 83 percent of doctors malpractice fees as well.   Swwweeet.    If you have a malpractice suit against a doctor and they can use government money to drag out the legal fees to break you.   Nice.  http://www.thespec.com/News/Local/article/509183"

As a student, I appreciate the work that our teachers do and understand that it isn't exactly the warm cuddly job that everyone seems to think it is BUT this striking thing has got to stop. I have friends at York that have been completely screwed because of the strike there. When you are paying for school (be it out of your pocket or in tax dollars) you should get exactly that, school.  Teacher's union strikes are not a good thing.  Also, there is no chance that an elementary school teacher needs the prep time of a highschool teacher. Sorry if that offends anybody."

Maybe we just don't have the same values.

I was just giving an example of how it does.  If you have a problem with the teachers paying for supplies then why don't you step up? I'm sure you'd want a number before you opened your wallet.  What does this have to do with values? this isn't personal. It's about union heads trying to extort money and benefits for their membership out of the public in the guise of it being ""for the kids"". I'm sorry I don't believe that, but it seems that you do.

I value my kids' education.  I don't get why we are freaking out over whether or not to properly fund our kids education when the $'s are far below what i spend on beer annually and FAR FAR FAR below what we paid the automotive industry to keep their workers in ontario.  btw - average teacher's salary is 71k.

I don't shun them away and I certainly don't expect to be paid overtime and won't be for staying later cause I would never ever ask for that.  Yes, I like my job.  I think people are very un-educated when it comes to teachers.  Ya they have summers off, and march break but for good reason, teachers work 10-12 hours a day, not 6.5.  Teachers have to deal with something worse then kids, stupid new age parents.  Same hockey moms that are lashing out at teen reefs cause jr. dot a penalty or the reef missed a slash.

305927,Headhunter,2009-02-13 13:57:00,5703,"Hi guys, Not to belabour the point, but I had a bit of a conversation with my wife about this... yes she is steaming!!!! Currently, there are 300 minutes each day, for teachers to teach. This is required by Ontario law. The teachers, under their current contract get 200 minutes per week of prep time... that's time not in the classroom, but time they are to spend preparing for future classes, marking etc... Now, and here's the part that really sticks in my craw... should they receive more prep time in this agreement, they will essentially be in the classroom four days a week! Yes, they will be in the school, but not in front of kids! So, who pays for this? You guessed it! You and I! Think about it. In order for the board to run the school properly, they are now going to have to hire more teachers, just to maintain the status quote, with regard to ensuring kids have a teacher in the classroom. Now, couple that with 2.5% increase over 4 years and you have a recipe for a huge sucking sound coming out of the provincal coffers. So, leagally the teachers have to be in class 15 minutes before class starts and they legally have to be in the class for 15 minutes after class. Does anyone know of a job that requires you to be at work for 5 hours a day and pays what a teachers job does? Benefits, holidays etc.. not with standing! Good gig, huh! HH  PS... Shad, you hit the nail on the head... the only reason my wife is still in the job, is because she loves it! Could she be doing a much better job, you bet, but her hands are tied. And yes, the new age parent is one of the biggest pains in the butt she has! Also, regarding the Education Assistants... they fall under C.u.p.e. and their contract states that they are required to be in the school until 3:30pm. My wife holds staff meetings from 3:15pm and at exactly 3:30pm, most of the EA's get up and walk out! Mid sentence, they get up and walk out... how many of us would still have a job if we simply got up and walked out on our boss, mid sentence?"

If the other person is perceived to be similar to the envier, the aroused envy will be particularly intense, because it signals to the envier that it just as well could have been him or her who had the desired object.[2][3]"

To me striking is equivalent to sulking like a child that doesn't get what they want. Whatever happened to working harder to better your situation? There are all kinds of people that are way better off than teachers and they have never had to strike for it. They just do something that society values more.  I'm sorry, but it doesn't take much education to become a teacher. They are lucky to make what they do, because there are thousand of people with equivalent education less the ONE year of teachers college that can't get a job in their field at all. I have a sibling with MORE education than teachers and she works as a waitress. And doesn't cry about it.

You'd create a class system that makes it very difficult for a kid in a poor area to get a good education and earn a great living later in life....does anyone really want that?"

Yes there are times (like now) that even the good workers are unemployed. But many of us work hard and I am sure we all have our tales of how hard it can be. There were times starting up my business working seven days a week 16 hour days over the first 5 years. But a strike now (by any union) I don't believe is a good plan. Sure will create lots of hard feelings. I honestly don't know how much teachers make but it isn't a pittance and they have some good benefits and pensions. If they are honestly concerned about the kids let them forgo a pay increase so the money could go towards the supplies required.

I think it's just insane when school boards, transit systems, garbage collectors, water services etc etc etc are allowed to walk out and totally screw up the lives of the very people that are paying their salaries.  A perfect example is the recent York University strike that screwed up the students for 3 months. It's basically over now, but alot of those students have lost their job opportunities for this summer and the money they were counting on for next years tuition.  In my job as a fireman we weren't allowed to go on strike, and the politicians would sometimes seem to use that to delay contract negotiations and force us into arbitration, but in the end we usually came out OK.  Were in the 21st century now and I think it's time we come up with a better solution to wage settlements that don't totally screw up the lives of all the innocent people that are caught in the middle of the disputes.  I always find it interesting that the politicians never have the money to pay the workers, but everytime THEIR contract comes up for re-negotiation, a bag of cash seems to drop from the sky.

Don`t you think someone you are trusting to educate your children should be to afford to live in the neighborhood they teach in?  In the states so things are probably a bit different. they not only have to be teachers, but cops, and moms and dads, because their parents either aren`t interested(unless little Johnny gets in trouble, then it`s my baby wouldn`t do that!) or don`t take time.  I delivered to a lot of schools in Cleveland, the teachers there should get hazardous duty pay, some had 3 or 4 cops roaming the halls.  Next door neighbors, both were teachers, I still is, cad/cam at the local vocational high school, he was in private business but took the job as a teacher at lower pay to be able to spend more time with his family, he has more than just teaching credentials, also an engineering degree. His wife stopped teaching to home school their children because she could give a better education with out the influence and distractions of other peoples kids.  Certainly a bad time to be in contract negotiations, but unlike politicians, businessmen, Wall street? The teachers don`t give themselves a raise, they have to bargain for it. You don`t bargain you fall behind, like most people with out unions.  Politicians belong to a Union (political party) doctors belong to a union ( American or Canadian medical association) businesses belong to unions ( chamber of commerce, Cose-council of smaller enterprizes) to negotiate for their best interests. Maybe they are just smarter?"

305391,Cudz,2009-02-12 15:52:00,2652,"Money is NOT the issue that is the problem for these teachers. It is equal time and working conditions as secondary teachers and safety issues. Money is a third or fourth consideration.  I have many teacher friends and none of them want to strike, in fact all that I have talked to wanted to accept the offered contract. SOmetimes unions act without fully consulting their members.  I know this.  Secondary teachers were not even shown their new contract, terms and pay raise offer until after the union already turned it down.  Every secondary teacher I knew wanted to agree to terms yet they somehow turned it down earlier in 08. When they finally did get a chance to vote, they overwhelmingly accepted the terms. THe union is strong and at time might not always represent the members.  Finally I would just like to thank the media.  Of course the media makes it a money thing.  Many teachers would accept 0% raise or even a pay cut in these times.  It is funny how everyone gets mad about how much money teachers get paid and their time off.  If it makes you so mad then maybe you should have become a teacher.  That is what I tell my friends who rag on teachers.  Good pay, great holidays and benefits.  Teaching is not for you? Oh, ok, then maybe you shouldn't comment on things you can't do and leave it to those who can. Just my opinion though Remember there are always 3 sides to every story and the media only shows you one."
305401,Cudz,2009-02-12 16:06:00,2652,Not true. Full Senority and experience and top level makes about 85 k 4 years from now with 3% per year they will be near 94 k
305404,Headhunter,2009-02-12 16:25:00,5703,"At the risk of being blasted, I'll chime in! My wife is a Principle in the Toronto Board, the school is K-8. She arrives at school no later than 8:00am. She leaves at 5:00pm. She has not had a lunch in 3 years! Yes, three years! As a single administrator in the school, her secretary takes her lunch, leaving the office empty if my wife isn't there. The secretray is a member of CUPE... she takes her lunch and breaks no matter what is happening in the school. My wife works nightly, until 10:00opm, doing the outragous amounts of paper work the board throws at them. That work does not get sdone during the day because my wife is constantly dealing with parents, disciplining students, dealing with various problems, kids hurting other kids, knives, drugs, drunk teachers... and all adminstrators do this! I have nothing but respect for adminstrators of schools... Teachers, well that's a differnet story! There are some really good dedicated professionals who do care, but I have to say, that many and I do mean many are folks who would not last a minute, in what I like to call the ""real world"". These people have graduated university to become teachers and so many of them can't meet dealines. EG, report cards late, spelling mistakes on report cards, gramatical errors on report cards... Oh and they virtually have to kill a child to get fired. I know of far too many teachers who simply get shipped from one school to next as they burn their bridges everywhere they go! Who pays for this ... the kids! And if the teacher has a level of seniority, they must be hired above other candidates, regardless of the actual abilities, or lack there of. Don't get me started on Education Assitants or custodial staff. My wife tells me her school is a dump! (mice , rats, racoons, chip munks) I ask her if she has confronted the custodial staff regarding the problem and her is is this; ""I have to be really careful how and what I say to him as I need him to work with me, so if I bust him too hard, he's actually do less!  And to make matters worse for her, he may file a grievence with the union, suggestioning that he is being brow beaten by and adminstrator. In the real world, he'd be fired! Not gonna happen. E/A's as they are called, are positions ANYONE can apply for! No education post secondary education required, nothing! They make around $35 -$40k per year. Teachers have a tough gig, unfortunately their working environemnt has changed and in my humble opinion, so has the ""type"" of person who gravitates to the profession. This ""strike"" is about prep time, not money. I think I should ask my boss if he could give me more time to prepare to do my job... I can already hear me working at my new job as a result... asking it you would like frys with that! LOL HH PS... Ronald REgan had the right idea!"
305408,Headhunter,2009-02-12 16:31:00,5703,"Cudz, salary is dependant on the board you work for... I know some teachers who are in the $90K plus bracket. As far as principals are concerned... well they are essentially the CEO of thier school... they have responsibility for everything and all things that happen at the school and in many cases, they are responsible for what the kids are doing off of school property as well! They don't get summers off completely... my wifes is on call 7 x 24 x 365 with regard to anything that happens at her school... I don't think her salary is out of line for any position with a similar level of resonsibility. HH"
305411,misfish,2009-02-12 16:44:00,29133,"Muddler thanks you for that. Well said. Also by others here too. I dont believe I was bashing the teachers.Pointing out that striking in this day of the economy is not right. Also my comment about then and now as far as the care of the teaching.I have seen the change,you just have to listen to the kids out there these days. Back in the day you got a good cuff it you spoke out of line.Now the kids run the show."
305416,cram,2009-02-12 16:54:00,1733,Lots of interesting views here.   I wonder -- would everyone prefer if schools were private?  If it were a free market?
305417,cram,2009-02-12 16:55:00,1733,Headhunter -- sounds like your wife hates her job.  That's really unfortunate.
305418,Grimace,2009-02-12 16:59:00,2020,That really sucks that the secretary at a school gets a lunch.    What can we do to stop this injustice?
305419,Headhunter,2009-02-12 17:01:00,5703,"Cram, my wife loves her job! What she doesn't like is the mediorce or incompetant being rewarded with life long postions, with little or no interest in anything but themselves. If she frustrated... you betcha! Her perception of what she should be doing on a daily basis, spending time in class rooms and working with the community to introduce new curiculum is what she loves to do... and she's good at it! Unfortunately, the lions share of her day is spent very much like the guys that follows the elephant in the parade! HH"
305421,cram,2009-02-12 17:08:00,1733," Well it sounds like she hates all the people she works with, which doesn't sound like much fun."
305422,LeXXington,2009-02-12 17:09:00,1928,"Its a quick one, No Employee on the public purse should have the right to strike. PERIOD.  Cause we the People don't have a way of saying no. Enough is a Enough.  I hate it when we get held hostage until we give in. Regardless how much it hurts the average person Goverement has to get the money from somewhere to pay there people what they demand so they just tax more.   There are many people on this board that are having job issues.  Being told to pay teachers more just cause they said so or they will strike if you don't is a form of terrorisim too me.  teachers have the best of the hostages going... Not only do they hurt the kids but they put the parents in trouble too.  You are a union employee working for a company that has competition go strike enjoy.  If it works for you good if not and your out of a job oh well.  Say NO to public unions"
305423,muddler,2009-02-12 17:14:00,623,"I just happen to be watching KIRO news fron Seattle a couple of days ago. The mayor of Seattle has offered to take a 3% pay cut and hopes that it sets an example for the rest of his staff. Now that's the kind of thinking we should all have.  In todays Sudbury Star the headline reads,""Elementary teachers pressured to accept new $700-M deal today"". Sounds good for the teachers, but once you read a little further it reads, ""However, it doesn't appear to resolve a key issue: the union's demand that the province commit to closing a $711-per-student funding gap between elementary and high schools.""  So waht's all this about? Take a walk around your local Elementary School or better yet volunteer a day a week for a while. You will be shocked by what you see. $711 X 30 students per class = $21338 for resources and materials per class per year.  Tough to argue that!  Muddler"
305433,Cudz,2009-02-12 17:33:00,2652,Generally the salaries are within $1000 of each other in every board.  Some teacher will make extra money if they are dept. leaders and can make extra money on top of that if they are co-op leaders etc. so $90 k is possible but there are very few.  Administraiton can make over $100K but you already know that seeing as your wife is one.  $85000 is for a catgory 4 teacher (as qualified as can be) with 11 years teaching experience. Teachers can make less thatn $40K if they are new and not as qualified.
305140,misfish,2009-02-11 23:21:00,29133,"Seem the school board wants more and by the sounds of it,dont care what comes of it. Get what they want,or strike.  Heres my statment on this. If you are a teacher and offended  Fathers and mothers are losing thier jobs, Some are just hanging onto thier jobs. Can they afford childcare,can they afford to take time off of work to care for thier children?  NO NO NO.  I know what I am saying ,as we went through this during a teachers strike. Lucky for us then,our working conditions were good and we could take turns with days off and had friends to help watch the kids.Cost us holidays, but we got through it.  In this day of lay offs and loss of jobs.ya all need to give yer head a shake on this one.    Or is the thinking,THEY NEED US.  Teachers and those above them, need to go back to the care for the child and help them learn. This crap puts a real sour taste in my mouth.  I always wondered about home teaching,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I CAN SEE WHY THEY DO IT.  This crap is getting way out of hand,and well like the CAW,yer NEXT. This is one strike I want the goverment to say back to work,if ya dont,see ya.Next.  This really is not a union bash as more a deeper topic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Our children and grandchildrens future.   Im done venting."
305142,Terry,2009-02-11 23:26:00,14456,"so are you saying someone who works 9.5 months a year 6.5 hrs a day should be happy with the 92 thousand bucks they were offered and not want the same pay as high school teachers 96 thousand  and you think they daont need more planing time less teaching time  dang, in many parts of the USA the same doesn't make 45 thousand"
305143,Gerritt,2009-02-11 23:27:00,6129,Well said Misfish..... not to mention how the kids at York U. got screwed... declare our educators an essential service.
305147,aniceguy,2009-02-11 23:33:00,1094," wheres my hat to take off for ya.....we know this thread will get tanked soon so here is some more to add... Unions  they certainly had thier place in past to secure better conditions, asafe environment, better pay and beyond of that there is no doubt and many owe thier current situation to  union members from past..our global economy has changed there are policies and programs in place to protect workers at the work force I for one think unions have out lived thier times and I think much of those dues could go to better places like workers pockets"
305149,walleyejigger,2009-02-11 23:34:00,876,"good point, never thought of it that way, (being a child care provider in itself, even though that's not what its meant to be)"

305177,rob v,2009-02-12 00:26:00,535,"I have to say - I think our educators deserve a decent living - they certainly do an important job. And I want the best teaching my kids.  But having said that - there's only one pocket all this comes out of - and sooner or later that pot is going to run dry (many think it already is). In addition to that, the thing I get tired of is what appears to be the lack of quality control.   I think most of the teachers out there are good, but it doesn't seem like their performance is what drives their remuneration. What seems to matter only is the number of letters behind their names.  Something that many of us in private industry don't have the luxury of - either perform - (and the bar is always being raised) or say good-bye.  Timing is everything and this certainly isn't good timing to be conducting these types of negotiations especially with public money.  Hopefully they use the education they've got and think this through.  Public opinion certainly isn't going to be on their side if they walk out."
305181,Fisherman,2009-02-12 00:32:00,7201,"I think they should be allwed to strike....all summer long.   If they can't get along on the salary they make now, maybe they should try minimum wage for a while."
305190,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-12 00:43:00,2585,they get paid well enough and have summers off.  i know where this thread is going lol  unions are ruining everything in our country.
305195,misfish,2009-02-12 00:51:00,29133,"Like I said,union aside,I want to know, why they got into this profession for????????  Educating or the money?  When I was in high school.it was all about the teaching.Yeah, I still skipped and failed classes,but they always tried to help me make it up."
305216,Tarzan's Jane,2009-02-12 01:22:00,1183,"I'm not a teacher, and have to say that I'm not so sure I would want to be.  Times have changed, laws have changed, much has changed.  In many ways it's a doggie dog world and I would think that any one of us would like to make more money.  Haven't they though agreed on some things although I'm not too 'up' on their 'demands'.  Depressing is what it is to be living in our messed up world....it's tough being a young person trying to figure out what profession to get into, never mind having to deal with peer pressure, troubles at home and some teacher in your face cuz you didn't get your homework done...where and how do young people get rid of their stress...cuz they have it too....do you think maybe it happens in the classroom...no doubt some of it does....one teacher with 30 or more young people who are getting ticked off at the world because in their eyes adults messed up and that one adult standing up there getting the summers off, driving a nice car should really  'earn' their easy money.  Who knows eh."
305236,TennesseeGuy,2009-02-12 01:58:00,957,"Don't know about up yonder, but down here we have private schools doing a much better job than government schools and at half the cost.  We would benefit from a voucher system."
305243,holdfast,2009-02-12 02:04:00,1813,"Yea like the leader of Teachers in New Brunswick that the CBC did a big stink about because this week he is the victim where last week it was the kids, parents, and us Hicks that cared when he decided to take the Anthem away from morning periods because HE felt that the students shouldn't be as he quoted SUBJECTED to the National Anthem.  This looney toon ring piece should remember who actually pays for the schooling.  Yup you got it.  Me and you and the Students parents.  I still remember the incompetence's in our High school that called themselves educators.  Oh yea and in the 70s we had a lot of strikes.  It only hurts the students in the end. LOL look what happened to me.  I blame it on the Strikes.  Now can I get stress leave and payment."
305271,douG,2009-02-12 03:23:00,2693," That still happens, misfish.  Except now the problems with the kids are even worse.  Those kids in gangs, ignored by their parents, no respect, violence, all the social ills we been talkin bout, guess who gets to deal with that during daylight.  Sometimes they show up for class, a gr 9 with 20 dime bags and a flick knife.    26 slime and mold filled portable classrooms, and 70 bus loads of kids every day. This happens in Halton region, btw.  The teaching still happens, and they try even harder these days, with credit recovery programs, opp or regional police on campus, adult ed courses and sidestream diplomas where you learn to read roadsigns, cook for yourself, and stay off welfare.  I can pick more than a few folks that would totally suck at that job."
305272,cram,2009-02-12 03:29:00,1733,"You guys don't know what you're talking about.  I don't know a single teacher making 92k. I bet the average salary is 60.  Much of the platform they are supposedly striking behind has little to do with salary and much to do with funding for your/our kids.  I personally don't get why that is their issue to fight for, but for some reason its part of it.  Maybe because most of the stuff in your child's classroom was paid for by the teachers, out of their pockets, and isn't tax deductible.  So...maybe funding from the government means they dont have to pay for it themselves.....i have no idea.  I think the contract they're negotiating is for 4 years or 5 years.   The optics on timing are bad, but its hard to not ask for $ increase that at least matches inflation when you're locked in to that for quite a while.  The negotiation has been happening for a long time (a year or two?).  While i doubt they go on strike soon anyway (has the union said that, or the media just hyping it up to make news), there has been ample time to get something negotiated on both sides.  But again, the part that pisses me off is that teachers pay for most of the stuff in kids' classrooms.  That shouldnt' be the case."
305274,cram,2009-02-12 03:32:00,1733,"btw - someone should look up what board administration folks make.   Plus look up what the custodial staff make.......and then compare both to teachers.  Its fine to complain about it coming out of OUR pockets, but I would rather pay my kids' teachers more $$ and the board administrators less (many of whom make multiple hundreds of thousands)."
305285,muddler,2009-02-12 04:03:00,623,"Oh, yes ! The favourite teacher bashing has started.  I agree that this is not a good time to be talking strike.  The teachers should be setting an example in these hard times, but.......  It's always funny to hear the half truths from someone looking from the outside in.  I have friends in all kinds of jobs. One is a bricklayer. He lives ina very nice house (mortgage free) and has two very nice SUVs. He goes to Florida for the winter, has a boat down there. I know he makes a pile of money (he won't tell me how much). He has all kinds of investments. What an over paid job. So one day he asked me to help him out. So this is my big break, I can learn how to make some big money. Up at 5:00 am and at the job site by 6:00 am we worked until sundown that summer day till about 9:300 pm. Now I think he's under paid. I worked one day and I was sore for a week. He does this 6 (sometimes 7) days a week. I think he earns his money.  Another buddy is a heavy machine operator. You the those big rigs for excavting that you see on highway construction. He works like a dog and makes a lot of cash. Has the winters of to do whatever he wants. Nice job huh? Is he over paid?  I've a pile of stories like that, and I'm sure you do too.  Just about every job looks that way until you get in there and sniff around.  Now let's look at teachers. In 2005 (it was the only data I could find in a hurry) the average daycare per child in Ontario was $420 per month. At that rate a teacher with 30 students for 10 months would earn ....lemme see....... $420 X 30 X 10 = $126000 . I could handle that. Oh yes, they have to teach too. Teach to strict Provincial tests (EQAO) so that when the school gets rated, they get blamed if the their school  doesn't preform to some expection that is set by someone else. If the school scores are high, well the students are really great. Teachers are required to be educators, guidance councillors, coaches, cirriculmn planners and report to each parent if there are any concerns. Teach discipline , values and deal with every issue from , bullying, gangs, drugs, nutrition, hygene and abuse often with little support from some of the parents of these kids that need the most help. They take courses to improve their teaching skills and to stay on track with new changes in education in thier OWN TIME DURING THE SUMMERS! They take work home to be marked and corrected on a daily basis (most people don't get to see that).  They have to prepare lessons that will motivate the students to learn (try that some time) and they do not have a choice in the topic s that they teach. $96000 at year if you last 10 years and you are in the top category, most start with a lot less than that.  I'm a retired teacher. I was at work at 7:00 am and usually left at 7:00 pm. Once we had children of our own I left work at 5:00 pm (still got there at 7:00 am) and I would work after the kids went to bed. Weekends, what weekends? I was marking most weekends, but I had the summers off and I was over paid.  A neighbour of my used to give me the gears on how easy my job was, over paid, summers of until his son married a teacher. Then he changed his tune a little. When he retired he volunteered at the local school for 2 days a week. A month late he apologized to me. He asked, ""How do you put up with all the crap every day, yet alone teach?"" He was a very successful hard working Civil Engineer.  Yes, it always looks good from where you're standing. I respect everyone's job and I don't knock what they are making. If it was that easy we'd all be doing that job. Teachers are the easiest group to complain about. Why not, free daycare and an education to boot at a bargain price. The ""love of teaching"" is gone. Thank Mr. Mike Harris for that. Standardize everything taught and process the kids like little sausages. It's very cost effective.  Enough!  Muddler"

I have no idea how much they make, but it might be in the range of 200-350 k or more.  Yet, dentists have the highest rate of suicide of any profession.  How hard could it be to do a little tippy tap, pick, poke etc.?  That ain't woikin, that's the way you do it.  I bet those dentists get their chicks for free.  Money for nothing, not to mention."
