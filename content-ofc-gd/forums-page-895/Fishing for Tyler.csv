306924,MuskyBill,2009-02-16 05:00:00,311,"Hey Mo, there was a lady out there taking pictures, & I was wondering where those pics will turn up. It was a really nice camera she was using & I'd like to see how she made out in other spots on the ice."
306984,Beans,2009-02-16 14:42:00,3339,I believe that lady photographer is with one of the local newspapers...hopefully Maureen remembers which one...  She comes to the event every year...  Actually there were two women wandering around taking pictures out there...the second one was the mother of the young lad that Photoz was entertaining affording her the time to take some pics...I hope Maureen has contact with her...
307497,motv8tr,2009-02-17 21:06:00,2587,"  Hey bill, there were two women out there taking Photo's, one was from the Bradford Exchange, and the other was a professional photographer who brought her son out.  The lady from the exchange will print a couple in their next edition, and both will be mailing me CD's of the photo's they took.  When I get them I will post some....  Maureen"
307564,MuskyBill,2009-02-17 23:18:00,311,"Yeah, that was her. We spoke for a while, & she said her son was autistic as well.  She had a really nice camera, so I'm thinking the pics would come out great!"
307618,motv8tr,2009-02-18 00:54:00,2587,I'll let you know when I get them....if there's some you want I'll figure out a way to get them to you....  Maureen
