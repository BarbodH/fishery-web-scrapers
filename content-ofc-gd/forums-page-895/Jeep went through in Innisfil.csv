307026,irishfield,2009-02-16 18:05:00,26272,Let me guess.. they slowed down to cross a pressure crack and dunked the nose?  As for current...Saturday was the first time fishing a lake where my line was sideways in the hole.
307034,mikegta,2009-02-16 18:28:00,39,was it a blue 4dr jeep???  as i was coming off the ice i saw a few guys get out of this jeep(which had blue plates) and they were talking to the fire and rescue guys.  we  were waiting to see if they were gonna launch the rescue vehicle but after a short chat they left!?
307043,Whopper,2009-02-16 18:46:00,2174, Wayne some of the ice flow pirates on Lake Erie said the same thing a couple weekends ago
307048,irishfield,2009-02-16 18:57:00,26272,
307067,Fisherman,2009-02-16 20:02:00,7201,"Okay, then I wasn't doing the crosseyed thing, our lines were probably 12-15 feet N/E of our holes on both Saturday and Sunday in 90 FOW."
307091,cityfisher,2009-02-16 21:40:00,959,glad they made it out safe... I was out on the ice yesterday but with my quad  Saw a BUNCH of cars and vans / trucks all around me on cooks.. ice where I started was close to 19' inches. But poop does happen! i know
307106,TJQ,2009-02-16 22:13:00,7806, LOL
306790,Cudz,2009-02-15 22:38:00,2652,My buddy just called as he watched a jeep go through the ice. He was first on the scene and all the guys got out albeit a bit wet and cold. They were from Indiana.  My buddy (on his argo) made sure they were fine.   They were a bit freaked out obviously. I will post more when I get the details.  THe jeep apparently did not sink completely
306795,Joeytier,2009-02-15 22:42:00,3990,Is there current in Innisfil?  I couldn't imagine a vehicle going through at this point in the season.
306799,glen,2009-02-15 22:52:00,2641,That's why i didn't drive out yesterday.
306803,Joey,2009-02-15 22:58:00,9122,"Well the problem is, ice is not always the same thickness everywhere.  It's a crap shoot, and it looks like they lost.  Glad everyone was okay.  Joey"
306804,Terry,2009-02-15 23:01:00,14456,I was told that on Saturday there was a current around there all that rain flowing down the rivers had to go somewhere
306807,Cudz,2009-02-15 23:08:00,2652,Pressure cracks as well.  I didn't drive out either yesterday.  Better to be safe than sorry.  I didn't mind the exercise.
306808,rhare,2009-02-15 23:11:00,387,"its the pressure cracks, some have opened hugh and re-froze with only a few inches of ice. I usually drive out but its just too iffy."
306810,danbouck,2009-02-15 23:12:00,4380,I don't think I can ever drive out on the ice! Not worth it for me.  (plus I can use the exercise  )
306812,richyb,2009-02-15 23:14:00,774,Buying a sled or an atv is cheaper than having to pay to get your vehicle out of the lake !!!!    Does insurance cover vahicles that go through ?
306813,Joeytier,2009-02-15 23:20:00,3990,"As far as I know, they do not cover it."
306816,FUSION,2009-02-15 23:23:00,81, Not 100% sure but if so I would love to here the conversation to the guys insurence company were he has got to explain to them he sunk his truck through the ice out of country.
306820,GeorgeJ,2009-02-15 23:34:00,207,"Vehicle on ice = no insurance, you were able to purchase extra insurance for a snowmobile going through the ice but not sure now a days."
306825,Big Cliff,2009-02-15 23:49:00,6899,"First, glad the guys are OK! Second, I asked my insurance agent that very question and was told ""There is no stupidity clause in your policy, you are insured for ALL perils""! Now, I have never personally tested that out......"
306827,BUSTER,2009-02-15 23:53:00,1336,covered by insurance for sure
306831,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-15 23:56:00,2585,glad there safe.  i think some insurance companies cover it.  cheers!
306834,kickingfrog,2009-02-16 00:05:00,8333," Sorry Big Cliff I can't leave this one alone...  Is that ""no stupidity clause"" specific to you?  How does ones insurance company deem a client worthy of such a clause? Is it one big dumb thing or is it a bunch of little ones? I wonder if that's in the small print on my own policy?  That's all I got for now, glad you (or I) haven't needed it."
306844,Terry,2009-02-16 00:28:00,14456,LOL I think he means if you have ALL perils in your policy then you are covered and there is no stupidity clause that states that if you do something stupid you are not insured  well that's how I took it
306850,Bernie,2009-02-16 00:38:00,3190,"Depends on your insurance company. Some will, some don't. If you are going to drive on the ice you should always check with several local folks that go on the lake themselves. Know the waterway and it's nuances. Currents from creeks and rivers after rains and mild spells erode ice thickness quickly. Pressure cracks seem to form up here when it's cold and the ice is expanding. Fissures can form during mild spells."
306872,Chuck Best,2009-02-16 01:57:00,308,I've been driving out there for 2 days .....I'll have to drive out tomorrow and find out where this guy went through.....Chuck....
306873,Big Cliff,2009-02-16 01:59:00,6899,"LOL, Terry understood me"
306875,glen,2009-02-16 02:02:00,2641,I saw a spot where the ice had opened up and refroze.  Head for that spot if you want to go though.
306897,Joey,2009-02-16 03:31:00,9122,   Make sure you stop right where he was Chuck and take some pics
306912,Sinker,2009-02-16 04:27:00,8692,"If you don't drive into cracks, you won't go through. Ya gotta watch them cracks......."
306916,tschirk,2009-02-16 04:43:00,261,My broker friend confirmed ths is true...
306950,Cudz,2009-02-16 13:07:00,2652,I will upload pics of the vehiclein the water etc later today.  I will start a new thread.  Pretty crazy pics
