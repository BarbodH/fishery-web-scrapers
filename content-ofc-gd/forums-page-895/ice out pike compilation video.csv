306216,limeyangler,2009-02-14 02:50:00,5204,"Hi all,  Well i got a nice 30"" pike yesterday, but due to not reading the rules to the tourney properly it aint gonna be allowed...my bad.  After getting a bit of flak from SNAG...lol...who apparently suffers from ""Taranna Pike Envy"" (good one GCD!) i found yself reminiscing about larger pike i've had, trying to convince myself that i would get a better one than 30"" for team # 3 anyway.  I did not realise i had so many videos of large pike i've caught, then realised that most of them were taken last May at the bottom of our yard right after ice out....and i put this little compilation together........still another two and a half months of ice fishing to go....but man...cant wait for some more of this...save so much on gas and its right on the doorstep....dont get much better than that! And with the baby due any moment now...i am gonna be spending a lot of time close to home anyway....lol.   The video is pretty long...sorry 'bout that...
