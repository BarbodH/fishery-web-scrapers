306983,Handlebarz,2009-02-16 14:39:00,3790,They are nice trucks and alot of the parts come from Canada to the USA where they are built its always nice to here people buying  North American built cars and trucks not total imports.
307018,tschirk,2009-02-16 17:03:00,261,"Over 12 years we had bought 9 new GM vehicles. Without going into why (that's been beat to death) I switched brands & bought a 2005 Pathfinder....I love(d) that truck, power, towing, snow, 4wd w stability/traction control...it was amazing. I found the service experience the same as GM (not great). With 147K now I was looking at new Catalytics ($2,300 due to ""bad"" gas??) body work and general maintenance to the tune of $6,000 total. Hence my decision for a new vehicle was financial and desire for high reliability. It felt like the Pathfinder wasn't going to last as long as I hoped for. The point is while it was initially a good quality vehicle, I think it would have long-term quality issues.  I hope the Honda lives up to the accolades I hear, I am excited!  Thank all of you for your very kind comments! Cheers Ted"
307030,doubleheader,2009-02-16 18:15:00,497,I have a 07 Ridgeline. I think it is essentailly the same as the new ones. I think you'll be very satisfied.
307033,Bernie,2009-02-16 18:25:00,3190,Of all the vehicles that come into my shop Honda seems to stand out as one of the most reliable vehicles. Not overly fancy but tried and true. There is a reason they hold their value. Great choice!
307039,misfish,2009-02-16 18:39:00,29133,"Cool truck. We stamp out many parts here in Barrie, for that truck and alot of the other Honda lines"
307071,Scott S,2009-02-16 20:36:00,203,"Great choice!!!  I just picked up one myself. I also work at Honda in Alliston. We still make the ridgeline in Alliston but only small lots. Mostly Civic's in both plants, the new plant in Alabama took the majority of the ridgeline and pilot. The Ridgeline is an awsome truck for those who don't need a full size. Scooter"
307378,cranks bait,2009-02-17 14:01:00,721,"Hey Ted,  Congrats on your new truck.  I fished with you a couple of years ago at Quinte.  I had mine there then.  Your boat will be no problem behind it.  I pull my Lund Explorer with ease.  I've had mine since they first came out.  I'm debating on getting a new one or buying out my lease.  They are a great truck."
306571,tschirk,2009-02-15 02:33:00,261,"After lots of research I bought this:  http://image.internetautoguide.com/f/auto-...a-ridgeline.jpg  Selection Criteria was: 1) Quality/Reliability per consumers reports 2) Tow at least 3,500 lbs 3) intelligent/auto 4WD 4) fuel economy 5) utility 6) fit in my garage (full-size was to big) 7) Good commuter vehicle - (I drive downtown TO every day)  And it's built Alliston Ontario to boot!  BTW: I used carcost.com and paid $500 over list, e.g. saved more than $8,500 off of MRSP."
306576,glen,2009-02-15 02:47:00,2641,Nice one.  I think it is 5000lbs towing cap.
306577,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-15 02:48:00,2585,right on its a nice truck!  cheers!
306578,Greencoachdog,2009-02-15 02:49:00,8163,They are beautiful vehicles... but don't you own a larger type boat?... and isn't a Ridgeline a little small for pulling it?  I guess I'm just old school.  I hope it brings you many years of enjoyment!
306581,Mattones,2009-02-15 02:57:00,587,"How much did it run yah? I like those with a cap on the back.  I went to the Applewood GM Dealer in Sauga today and priced out a Canyon with executive pricing it would cost me 30k unless i pay cash and get $4,500 off. which ends it up at $25k. Tough to decide. if i wanna buy new or used. I can't get over that freight charge is 1200."

306595,NANUK,2009-02-15 03:26:00,797,"Congrats! a very good & reliable vehicle, you'll love driving it, specially in the winter with that automatic 4WD, no fish-tailing in the snow/ice & no need to put sand bags in the bed. 5000 lbs towing capacity to boot, best of all its over 90% made in Canada. you did well on the price!"
306598,John Bacon,2009-02-15 03:30:00,3277,  I don't think that is true anymore.  Didn't they move production out of Aliston to the US to make room for increased production of Civics when the price of gas shot up?
306602,BillM,2009-02-15 03:46:00,17367,"Only thing I don't like about the Ridgeline are the high bed sides and that fact that you cannot lock in 4wd..  My brother in law has one, he's had zero issues with it since new.."
306603,NANUK,2009-02-15 03:51:00,797,"I stand corrected, its over 90% made in North America (some parts are from USA), but I think its still made in Alliston Ontario so as the Pilot and Acura MDX."
306606,NANUK,2009-02-15 04:04:00,797," I know what you mean LOL, those high sides ARE odd looking, you either like it or hate it, but I like the ""In Bed Trunk"" fill it with ice and you ready for a tailgate party You can lock in 4WD, its called VTM4 lock, but only in 1st, 2nd or Reverse gears, as soon as you reach a speed of 28kph it kicks out of the 4WD Lock and goes in automatic 4WD mode together with Vehicle stability control, electronic brake distribution etc , Honda's VTM4 Lock feature is only meant to get you out of a jam like a tricky/slippery slope or boat ramp, it kicks out to automatic to protect the 4WD system on higher speeds,"
306623,Sandbag,2009-02-15 04:24:00,533,And a resale value to boot.  Very nice  Cheers  Craig
306631,smbhunter,2009-02-15 04:31:00,186,"Nice. I'm in the market for a new vehicle, and have narrowed down the search to either a Toyota Tacoma, or a Ford Ranger. I didn't even check out the ridgeline, but I will look into it  now. Thanks for the post."
306651,tschirk,2009-02-15 06:30:00,261,My GF likes it because it looks like a smaller version of the Avalanche but with benefits of a Honda.
306655,lew,2009-02-15 10:16:00,12766,Congrats on the new truck Ted and hopefully you'll be very happy with it. I spent alot of time driving different Ridgelines last year  and I was always very impressed with everything about them.  There's just something special about driving down the road in a brand new vehicle
306659,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-15 11:38:00,1362,Looks like a nice truck Ted..  congrats on your new wheels!!
306670,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-15 13:03:00,2038,Congrats ...  Honda = Quality
306689,motv8tr,2009-02-15 14:04:00,2587,"Looks good, congrats to you and I hope it lasts a long time....they are a nice vehicle... Maureen"
306725,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-15 16:47:00,10439,"You're going to love it!!! I got a Pilot last year and it is a sweet vehicle. My last 4 vehicles have been Hondas and each one has been great!!!!! Have fun with it.  The VTM4 activates the center locking differential in 1st, 2nd and reverse as was stated. It locks all 4 wheels for superior traction in really crappy conditions. I have used mine to claw my way through a foot of snow on the lake.  UPDATE: once  the snow gets up to the bottom of the doors she gets stuck. At least with the conservative all season tires."
306730,LeXXington,2009-02-15 17:02:00,1928,"Very nice,"
306732,Billy Bob,2009-02-15 17:02:00,5865," According to Consumer Reports the Honda Ridge Line and the Toyota Tacoma better know as the ""Taco"" are rated very high.  Good Luck with the new sweet ride, Bob"
306789,2 tone z71,2009-02-15 22:36:00,1311,"dont ""trucks"" have frames ha JK ,nice looking lil rig"
306864,trophypikehunter,2009-02-16 01:41:00,89,"Thanks for buying the truck, I built the seats for that baby in NewMarket  although now the Ridgeline is being produced in Alabama aswell as the seats your purchase has insured another paycheck for me which means more fishing gear"
306919,tschirk,2009-02-16 04:47:00,261,Glad to help!!!
306940,blue pickeral,2009-02-16 12:10:00,267, One thing I learned from buying a new vehicle through the APA buying plan (www.apa.ca) is that the freight and PDI cost is negotiable along with everything else - extended warranties etc. Go into the dealer with the price you want to pay....not the other way around.
