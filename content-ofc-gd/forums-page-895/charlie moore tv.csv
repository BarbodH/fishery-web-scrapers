306784,scugpg,2009-02-15 22:16:00,1373,That is so true! Next he'll be having shore lunches once or twice an episode
306809,richyb,2009-02-15 23:11:00,774,"I liked his old show , Beat charlie moore, when it was like the scott martin challenge. I watched a bit of the show the other day and i think hes lost his mind !!!!"
306815,GBW,2009-02-15 23:23:00,8460,"Pull the plug on this show, PLEASE!!!!!  We would have a better show with any OFC'er then this FOOL!"
306819,Joeytier,2009-02-15 23:30:00,3990,Urban Outdoor Adventures and Hooked w/ Mark Krupa are both WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than this trash.
306858,Cudz,2009-02-16 00:53:00,2652,I like the show.  It is better than lunkerville.  Charlie's wife is good looking.
307463,fishingisliving,2009-02-17 19:09:00,170,"Saw Charlie Moore show once, the entire show he sat on his front steps, talking about how cold it was fishing for strippers. When he finally hooked a stripper(with 5 seconds of boat footage) the camera came back to him talking on his steps..  then some guy is crying because he cant go fishing with him...  then his wife says she doesn't like the cold.. and tells us to buy his book???  then he is on his steps again....  then commercial! YES!!!!!   ""..Hi! Billy Mayes here, with the hercules hook....""  "".. would you drink this stained water?.. why would you, but you are breathing it every day.... you have nothing to lose so call me""  ok back to charlie sitting on his front steps... BAH!!!!  Bring on the TARPON TOUR!!"
307464,BillM,2009-02-17 19:13:00,17367,This should would be a whole lot better if there were lots of strippers
307466,Roy,2009-02-17 19:29:00,13728,I think ol' Charlie probably got your hints by now.
306179,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-14 01:20:00,2585,"Man I thought I would give this guy another shot since the first impression i got was not really all that good.  But man every show i have seen is him talking about how great he is.  And since that bothers me everything about him is now bothering me.  even his wife is on the show now saying how great the show is, who are they trying to convince??  I hope wfn drops this show and picks up getting hooked.  8pm time slot on a friday night sure would be great!  Would love to see more canadian content.  Anyway guess im just bored lol  Cheers!"
306180,aniceguy,2009-02-14 01:21:00,1094,krupa is a neat show thats for sure
306183,Joeytier,2009-02-14 01:25:00,3990,"Charlie Moore is easily the worst fishing show I've ever seen.  Honestly, who wants to watch an arrogant loser like him drive around in a hummer, smoke cigars and catch 3 ounce bass for an entire show."
306184,TerryC,2009-02-14 01:25:00,196,I would rather sit with my wife and watch JOHN & KATE plus 8.   Clarence
306185,BUSTER,2009-02-14 01:27:00,1336,"lol   I KNOW   LOL     i really cant watch that show anymore and its always on for some reason,  the show is just sooooo hard to watch...eahhhha"
306187,Muskieman,2009-02-14 01:27:00,2472,I'd rather watch re-runs of Casting Out with Vince McDonnell  Tomorrow .    RFS 
306188,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-14 01:27:00,2585," thanks for the laugh, its funny cause i know you have done that lol  cheers!"
306189,tdotfisherman,2009-02-14 01:33:00,317," Good point.. has anyone noticed that in a lot of the fishing shows on WFN where there is Largemouth Bass fishing, the hosts will be very impressed over a 1-2 pound Largemouth.. calling it a big fish, and a real chunky fish, and this and that.. I don't get it? All the Largies I've ever caught have been at least 2-3 pounds.. and Canada isn't even known for its Largemouth.. anyway, food for thought..  and yeah, Charlie Moore TV is without a doubt the worst program on WFN.. I think I'd rather watch the Linedancer infomercial.."
306203,Greencoachdog,2009-02-14 02:12:00,8163,"... but ya gotta love Roland Martin with his ""This is a good 3,4,5,6,7,8 lb. fish!!!""  ""SON!!! YOU GOT HIM... SON!!!"""
306231,brifishrgy,2009-02-14 03:31:00,559,I have only seen his show once and it was by far the worst show I have seen .. I am sure he knows someone in high places at WFN .. its the only thing I can come up with since he is still on
306258,SlowPoke,2009-02-14 05:23:00,2984,"It's a weak show with very no payoff. I normally have WFN on while doing other things and I'll pay attention when I find something intriguing. When his show comes on, I have been switching the channel. I'll even sit through Courtney and Shelly; that's how much Moore's new format turns me off."
306262,moemoe,2009-02-14 06:11:00,352,"when your giving camera time to the camera guy talking about fart noises on a fishing show, you have defintetly lost it....Bring back Urban Outdoor Adventures and add Getting Hooked...."
306270,Handlebarz,2009-02-14 10:46:00,3790,I think some emails to WFN would be in order I can say that I dont know his show I think I had it one once but never again maybe that is why I dont remember it?
306279,FISHINGNUT,2009-02-14 12:21:00,253,Its 100% garbage with all the fisherman out there that would give there left jewel to have there own fishing show and this guy gets sponsors and air time I dont get it ???????????
306285,bigugli,2009-02-14 12:57:00,6138,Even the Dime Store Fishermen aren't that bad.
306287,Zebco,2009-02-14 13:06:00,123,"The way the guy talks, I think he has something stuck in his mouth."
306289,Handlebarz,2009-02-14 13:11:00,3790,well that's 2.5 min of my life I will not get back I saw it was on at 8 or right now so I wanted to be reminded about the show and I have to agree that is is very bad and I could not bare to watch the 2.5 min I did the best part is the wife did not know that I was watching it to see how crappy it was and made some comments about it also how fake they were. The only thing he has going is his wife. As for the show it will never be on my tv again.
306292,GeorgeJ,2009-02-14 13:17:00,207,"I'm watching it right now it's real bad, I'm wishing I had the last 15 minutes of my life back. It makes you look forward to the commercials"
306308,bobkayla,2009-02-14 14:18:00,148,the show sucks and so does charlie moore..
306706,lew,2009-02-15 15:19:00,12766,"I don't watch too many fishing shows and I'd never seen this one before,  but after everything you guys were saying about it I decided to have a look when I saw it advertised yesterday afternoon, and your right, that guy is just plain terrible and his show is even worse. I struggled thru it for 15 minutes and just couldn't take anymore.  Makes you wonder how something like that would even got a sponsor."
306761,hogman3006,2009-02-15 19:51:00,41,"I agree, someone write to WFN and send them a link to this thread. Charlie Moore sucks."
306768,BUSTER,2009-02-15 20:15:00,1336,
306770,BUSTER,2009-02-15 20:19:00,1336,
306772,KelfuN,2009-02-15 20:29:00,246,i agree with all of you guys 100%. i first watched the show for 10 minutes then gave up to another channel. never watched his show ever again..  Getting hooked is an amazing show..but Oasis keeps repeating it. is there only like 5-10 shows out there???
306774,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-02-15 20:38:00,0,"Would that show even be worse than the dime bag I mean dime store fisherman yippin and yahooin for every stinkin fish they catch, almost as sickening as the two goons who caught about 20 bows at the Ganny today throwing up into the sanctuary, and letting their baits drift down. P"
