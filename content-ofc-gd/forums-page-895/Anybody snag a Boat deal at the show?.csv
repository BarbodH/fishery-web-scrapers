I found what I think was a decent deal a couple a couple of weeks ago, last years model bought when dollar was at par about $1200 less than an 09 so the dealer passed that on to me. Did Boats seem priced real good? I read another post where tackle and stuff wasn't priced that great. I'm still looking for a 20 to 25 hp motor too if anyone noticed any real good deals on one..."
306806,danbouck,2009-02-15 23:03:00,4380,Didn't look too much at the boats this year. But did notice that the boat I bought last year is now $3000 more and nothing has changed on it.
306841,tdotfisherman,2009-02-16 00:21:00,317,"Deals on boats were far and few between.. everyone's raising their prices, even with a recession.. and most of the dealers throw a whack of unnecessary extra taxes and fees on top.. you see a boat for $14,999 sticker price, and once everything is all worked out it's somehow out to over $20,000.. what a rip off.. I think i'm going to be going the used route.."
306846,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-16 00:30:00,2585,there are some boat dealers out there that are selling off 2008 models for way cheaper then the 2009s that is the route i would go if you are stuck on buying new.  cheers!
306909,Gerritt,2009-02-16 04:19:00,6129,Looking for a boat???... Have I got a deal for you!  G

307001,nancur373,2009-02-16 15:59:00,1211,"Didn't look into the boats much at the fishing show. But the one that did stick out at me was a boat for 37,999.00 with a fishing show special of 36,199.00. A 'WHOPPING' savings of 1,800.00. Give me a break!"
307054,hirk,2009-02-16 19:06:00,571,"Guys it's simple, 95% of the product comes from the US and our dollar tanked resulting in 2009 product being about 15%-20% more before even allowing for the normal yr.-yr. 2-3% inflationary increases.If you can find what you want in an 08' you will save huge compared to 09' because the dealers purchased this product with close to PAR money."
307139,GeorgeJ,2009-02-16 23:10:00,207,"Sorry, yes I meant Spring Fishing and Boat Show"
307146,GeorgeJ,2009-02-16 23:15:00,207,Yup I saved $1200 on my 08 Grizzly 1448 AWL and matching trailer vs buying the same thing 09 model year. The lower dollar is about to take it's toll on automobiles and a whole lot more.
