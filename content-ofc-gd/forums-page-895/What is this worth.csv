306157,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-14 00:24:00,3761,"A friend of mine gave me this 1997 coin collection a few years back and I am  curious about how much money it's worth. Inside the case are 8 untouched, mint condition coins, the one on the top is a silver dollar and the coin to the right of the quarter below the silver dollar is a 50cent coin. Pictures:     Pretty cool set i think"
306160,Joeytier,2009-02-14 00:25:00,3990,Looks like $4.75 to me.
306161,Handlebarz,2009-02-14 00:26:00,3790,$4.91?
306163,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-14 00:28:00,3761,"   What, no big coin collector would want to give me more for this thing(i'm not selling btw)"
306164,Joeytier,2009-02-14 00:28:00,3990,I can't say I'm a coin collector.
306167,SNAGKING,2009-02-14 00:31:00,43,$4.16 plus case
306172,dnb_cbr,2009-02-14 00:51:00,61,$4.66.  what do I win??
306198,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-14 01:55:00,2585,i think it needs to be a lot older to be worth money.  hold on to it for 25years then ask around  cheers!
306201,Bernie,2009-02-14 02:00:00,3190,Put it away for your great grandson Mike. It may have increased it's value by then. Unless you have a rare one it takes a long time.
306206,Greencoachdog,2009-02-14 02:19:00,8163,"If they were double Beaver coins, you'd really have something there!!!"
306271,Big Cliff,2009-02-14 11:12:00,6899,"If you were selling it, probably about $21.00 to $25.00 ($25.00 if you are lucky) US. If you were buying it you would probably pay about $30.00 US (plus freight).  To get top dollar for stuff like this you have to be in the right place, at the right time. Dealers want to give you about half of what it is worth on the open market but if you try to sell it on EBay by the time you get done with the time involved and fees and hassle you are probably further ahead to just go to the dealer."
306273,Roy,2009-02-14 11:20:00,13728,What Bernie said.
306274,BUSTER,2009-02-14 11:22:00,1336,"me mother started collecting for me and my older brother since we were born, i have every one since 1975 pennie-100 bill !  I really should start a collection for my kids every coin since birth but iam 12yrs behind already!!!"
306276,pikehunter,2009-02-14 11:43:00,1659,"Unfortunately probably not worth as much as you would like it to be worth or think it's worth. We just sold off what was left of my father's coin collection. We had some pretty old coins including several mint sets like you have and there was enough coins to fill one of those big plastic storage bins you can buy at Walmart plus some more. Trust me, for what we got none of us got rich, if I had my way I and the room for them it would have been as well to have just kept them. My share was enough to buy a tank of gas, some groceries and a case of beer.  Enjoy the set for it's beauty and don't ever disassemble the case and touch the coins. Like said, put them away and maybe someday..."
306293,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-14 13:18:00,2038,$ 2.27 cents American
306302,Zebco,2009-02-14 13:47:00,123,"I agree not worth much I have alot of old Silver Dollars, Susan B anthony's and half dollars that my Grandfather gave to me.  Gonna save for my kids.  Just like my Baseball Cards, you will get ripped off if you try selling them to a dealer!"
306338,Toronto_Angler,2009-02-14 15:30:00,698,Unfortunately coins aren't really worth much money unless they have an error on them or are in short supply....Even if you have coins over a hundred years old they still don't fetch much.
306340,MCTFisher9120,2009-02-14 15:42:00,3761,"Thanks for the comments everybody, I'm not planing on selling my little collection i was just curious to see if it was worth anything. As others have said i will hold on to it and keep it safe for many many more years.  Thanks for the feedback and please add more if needed.  Mike"
306348,johnnyb,2009-02-14 16:10:00,3413,"Keep it for a long time, and while you're waiting, anonymously buy up every other set like it, so they become rare and mysterious...then slowly sell them off, one ""newly discovered"" set at a time"
306646,CLofchik,2009-02-15 05:48:00,854," Unfortunately age has nothing to do with coin value.  It's all about scarcity & errors.  My grandfather collected pennies in his spare time, by the time he was done he found every penny from 1900 to 2000.  1900 penny might fetch $5, 1923 $50 (only a few thousand made that year in the Depression), but the most valuable he found was an off centre struck 1978 that was missing half the Queens head, $500.  Run of the mill Canadian coins will never be worth much, a set like yours will be lucky to fetch $100 in your lifetime."
306724,mad_on_fishing,2009-02-15 16:38:00,21,"im big on  coin collectin,,and both my sister and i got one for each of the years that we were born...at the time,,,they were about $30...now,,im thinking about $35-$40."
307066,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-16 19:50:00,0,  those are going for $10 to $11 bucks  nothing these days is collectible cause everyone collects them  what you need to get is a 1901 canadian penny and a 1926/1927 quarter now we are talking real money
307196,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-17 00:33:00,260,When you have some free time wander through some flea markets...there are plenty of coin collectors offering stuff for sale/trade etc.  You will get to see what is common and what is rare.  I have a small collection including some rare bills that I won't be trading any time soon  I also have an American $2.00 bill.  If you ever find one grab it.  I spotted a large collection of Amercan $2.00 bills done up in a glass frame recently...almost fell over when I saw the price.  It stayed
307198,BassAsin,2009-02-17 00:36:00,806,does that mean she has two quarters from 1991? they are very very rare
