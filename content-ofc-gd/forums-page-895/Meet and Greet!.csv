I was blowen away buy the crowds at my seminar's and all the signings after! You guys rock! I wish I had more time to hang out with you all at the meet and greet. But the short time we had was great. I say we make this a tradition who knows maybe I can turn the corner of the booth into a bar!!  Once again thank you ALL for your support as always!  Pete thanks for the hat it will hang in my office in a place of honor!  Take Care everyone  Dave Mercer"
