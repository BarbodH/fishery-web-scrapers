307884,carp-starter,2009-02-18 18:53:00,253,"I thank you all for your info. After a short snooze, I was able to keep my eyes open.  I used the easiest way - to me - and I used muddler's method (right click on AVG Icon and then click on 'Exit' then ... press yes).  Some of the solutions I read on the Net were simply out of this world.  Tomorrow, I will scan my first slide and see the first results - too tired right now. I bought the scanner to digitize my slides. I doubt it very much if I find even one PIC relating to fishing.  Thanx - carp-starter  muddler Are you using Windows Xp? If you are, maybe this is the reason why you did not get the message that I got. I have Vista.    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  I bought an Epson V500 flatbed scanner. All looks OK and I thought that everything was going to go smoothly.  But when I got to install the Epson software, I was informed --  ""Please disable any anti-virus software before continuing this installation"".  I looked but I could not any info as to how disable AVG.  I do not know how to disable AVG temporarily. I could delete AVG and then re-install but because I have dial-up, it would take me over 3 hours.  Can anyone help me - my installation of the Epson software has stopped.  In the mean time, I will keep on looking on the net.  Thank you every one.  carp-starter  EDITED AND ADDED --- I have Windows Vista.... AVG version is -- AVG Free 8.0 I hope it is a simple explanation or else I might get lost  EDITED AND ADDED I have decided to delete AVG and then re-install AVG. It will take time but it will be the simplest way.  In any case, I will have some sleep because I have not slept in 33 hours - I almost fell out of my chair here - lol - I have done it more than a few times before.  I thank you for your help guys."

307898,muddler,2009-02-18 19:39:00,623,I also have an Epson Perfection V500 Photo flatbed scanner. When I installed the software from Epson I did not get a warning about diabling AVG.  But go to the tray icon in the lower right corner of desktop... right click on AVG Icon and then click on 'Exit' then ... press yes. That should disable AVG until you reboot.   muddler
