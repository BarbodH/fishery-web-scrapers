307058,fishinfool,2009-02-16 19:13:00,366,"I got out with a bud yesterday on Simcoe, a friend showed us where all the Whities are. Got there at 11:30 and by 5:00 we had caught about 30 Whities and I got my first Laker ever. Of course we only kept 2 each and the rest went back to be caught next time. Around 3:00 pm about six carloads of people that knew our guide showed up, kids everywhere. James and I started handing our lines over to the little ones when we got them on and the little ones brought in some good sized Whities. They all had a great time and I think all of them got at least one fish each. It was fun watching their faces while they were bringing up the fish, they were in their glory. My first Laker gave me quite a tussle with 4 lb line on, it went about 12 pounds and fought hard all the way up. All in all, the day was awesome sunny and no wind until around 2:00 and even then it was pretty nice. I have a couple of movies but I am not sure how to post them here, I will try and figure it out but until then this is the only pic I got."
