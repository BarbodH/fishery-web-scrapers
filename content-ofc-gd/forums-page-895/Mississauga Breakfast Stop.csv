I'm planning on leaving early to try and avoid traffic and would appreciate any recommendations on a good restaurant for breakfast near Courtneypark & Tomken.  Thanks in advance for the help.  Dan"
307318,rbaquial,2009-02-17 04:45:00,968,"I used to work at Tomken & Eglinton area - not too far away from where you're headed. Anyway, there is a PORTUGUESE RESTAURANT that is open as the earliest nearby factories (7am I think?) Well, its around TOMKEN & TIMBERLEA (just north of TIMBERLEA) found  HERE . I don't know if they're still around (its been almost 3 maybe 4yrs ago now). Anyway, if I remember... their sign was WHITE BACKROUND and RED FONTS."
