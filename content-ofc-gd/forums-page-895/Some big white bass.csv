307541,ehg,2009-02-17 22:13:00,2666," Thanks for further replies. That Gizzard Shad fought like a sheepshead, but was quite undesirable.  Usually the Browns are still hitting until mid- April, i stop fishing for them at end of March. There are still decent walleye to be caught like in my avatar.  Glad some folks still enjoyed this less than stellar report.  Cheers, ehg"
306580,ehg,2009-02-15 02:55:00,2666,Had some morning obligations but was still able to get out fishing this afternoon with my buddy Dave.  Tried our usual spot to see what was happening. Got all prepared and arrived there to see the whole northern shore of Lake Ontario looking like chocolate milk in this area. We still went out thinking it would clear once away from shore.    You can't really tell from picture above but visibility was less than a foot from all the rain and melted snow dumping in the lake a couple days ago. No matter how far out from shore it was still murky. Turned out to be one of the lesser excursions but still managed some fish.  Dave managed some decent white bass. Some pictures   more  and more   Caught one of these things you don't see to often   It is a gizzard shad. They are plant eaters so i think i snagged it in it's face. Probably why they are rarely caught.  Actually was not the best fishing day but was nice to get out on softwater and cast etc...  Saw this oddness when arriving back at the vehicle    Some dude was ripping around on the ice on his motorcycle.    It was pretty wicked and he was going fast. Once he stopped to show his tires which were studded. He said the faster you go and sharper you turn the more they dig in the ice.   Pretty cool stuff!
306593,Joeytier,2009-02-15 03:19:00,3990,Nice going.  The lake looked nice and calm.
306607,Leecher,2009-02-15 04:06:00,7832,Great report and pics ehg Beautiful white bass you guys caught... gotta love open water Thanks for sharing Leechman
306611,snag,2009-02-15 04:11:00,1932,You're mad.  It was clearly murky out there.  Yet you went anyways??!!  I'm waiting for Tuesday for the brown water to leave.  I'm in awe of the species that are attracted to the warm water there.  Can't wait for your piranha and shark reports! LOL  Way to go EHG (Erik Has Gonads)  
306612,Beats,2009-02-15 04:11:00,543,The look on your face as you hold that shad is priceless.  Actually it looks a lot like your avatar.
306619,Greencoachdog,2009-02-15 04:20:00,8163,"Excellent report and pics Erik!!!  The ""so-called"" Gizzard Shad is clearly a mutant Whitefish and should've had it's pic taken with our Team Logo to be entered into the tourney Bubba!!!  ... as a matter of fact, pic all of your fish with the logo... and I'll decide what they are at the time of posting!!!  Thanks for taking the time to post that Bubba!!!"
306634,Sinker,2009-02-15 04:42:00,8692,That gizzard shad is pretty cool! I've never seen one before........neat catch for sure!!!  Sinker
306658,lew,2009-02-15 10:46:00,12766,"Thanks for that Eric, I always enjoy reading your fishing tales when your out in the boat in the middle of winter.........good stuff !!"
306663,b2kptbo,2009-02-15 12:37:00,1505,Some good sized white bass...
306666,OhioFisherman,2009-02-15 12:50:00,6623,"Nice job EHG! Used to catch a gizzard shad every once in a while Crappie fishing on bays off of Lake Erie, every one was foul hooked so I believe you are right on them eating plants. Nice sized whities!"
306675,limeyangler,2009-02-15 13:26:00,5204,Nice job Ehg!  WOW....open water...lol...i wont see that until May!!!!
306701,majorlifts,2009-02-15 15:03:00,171,"That was a great day all the same, not sure the fish were feelin it. I was really expecting some Browns but I had an awesome day throwing the line out there in open water. NICE!!"
306716,jace,2009-02-15 15:43:00,472,"I can't tell from the picture if it's a factory ice tire but we used to do this to our bikes and 3 and 4 wheeler tires all the time.   All you need is a few hours, a few boxes of cap screws, and  a socket on a drill to turn them into the knobs.   If i remember right, it usually takes 3-500 for each tire depending on how big it is.  There are proper hardened screws for this too but we never bothered...   talk about grabby traction."
306717,jwl,2009-02-15 15:50:00,1056,"gotta love it..open water fishing in the lake and ice sports all in the same report  nice looking fish, shows ta go ya that you just never know until you get out there fishing"
306740,irishfield,2009-02-15 18:08:00,26272,Great stuff Erik... always great reading your adventures (that most wouldn't even attempt this time of year)
306754,SlowPoke,2009-02-15 19:31:00,2984,"Ahhhh, soft water. Can't wait!! Thanks for the report."
306757,Fishing 24/7,2009-02-15 19:40:00,709,awesome whities...............bass!
306767,Zubris21,2009-02-15 20:07:00,563,Great report!  thanks for sharing!  It's nice to see a couple species we don't see all the time!  keep it up!
306878,ehg,2009-02-16 02:21:00,2666,"Thanks for the replies!  Probably the worst fishing day out there, never had 'blown' conditions in this area. The gizzard shad was pretty strange however, too bad it was so slimy and kinda smelled strong.  The motorcycle on the ice was real cool though. The fella said the tires were factory tires. The studs weren't sharp they seemed more like they crushed the ice for traction.  Hopefully will have better luck with the fishing next time.  cheers, ehg"
306918,snag,2009-02-16 04:46:00,1932," Oh yeah,  Like you were skunked!  "
306962,Jigger,2009-02-16 13:45:00,1237,"Cool looking shad. I've always pictured them a little smaller. Thanks sharing, always like your midwinter reports."
306986,OhioFisherman,2009-02-16 14:44:00,6623,"Here in Ohio studded tires were legal, I don`t do enough driving to worry about them any more. Tire had pre made hole in them and most tire shops could insert the studs for a few bucks a tire. Hard to beat on icey roads, probably the only thing better is chains but a hassle to put on and remove. I always used to use studded tires on my cars in the winter. Points aren`t sharp, looks kind of like a pop rivet, hardened.  LOL never seen a shad? Wait till you experience one of their die offs. They seem to be severely affected by water temperature and can die off in the thousands, smell, and if your using a lure with exposed hooks you get to remove smelly dead shad from them."
307323,Markystang,2009-02-17 04:55:00,131,"I used to put hex head sheet metal screws in the knobs on my dirt bike. It's awesome in the winter, but not so much fun on pavement in the summer. Makes a cool orange ring around the tire at night though..."
307442,CLofchik,2009-02-17 17:28:00,854,"If you're caught on the road with studs on your tires south of Parry Sound it's a $1k fine.  Just sayin'....... Frenchman's Bay is fine though, and slightly awesome  What water temps usually start putting your usual spot off, how long can the brownie bite still be decent there? Keep meaning to go back there but my gonads are starting to shrivel with age.  Ever see any pickeral, used to get some nice ones after dark along the rip rap there after dark?"
307448,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-17 18:02:00,2050,"Same here - I always enjoy your softwater winter reports, even if they do make me seriously jealous!  Those white bass are on my ""to catch"" list to, so it hurts that much more!  cheers, UF"
