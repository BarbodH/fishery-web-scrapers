307179,glen,2009-02-17 00:14:00,2641,http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0001000_100-1-1  Anyone have any input on this reel.  I want a low profile reel that will reel in baits like a calcutta or curado.   I need left hand too.  Is this it?
307183,rbaquial,2009-02-17 00:17:00,968,I think Calcutta's are ONLY the ROUND-MODEL baitcast reels....almost positive.  If you're in the market for a low-profile baitcast reel... I bought 4 DAIWA TIERRAS found  HERE ... and I've NEVER had any problems with them!
