He wasn't the biggest pike in the world but he sure was fun. Take a peek.    Its 5:14 am here and Im about to go and hit the water again.  Be back with more pics soon"

370924,farsider,2009-08-09 16:32:00,456,"If you start targetting them, you would be well advised to use a 80lb fluorocarbon leader with appropriate snaps and swivels.  After being bitten off with 30lb and then 50lb braid like it was cotton candy, I started using the fluoro and haven't been broken yet(fingers crossed).  Cheers,  Mark"

371136,hoot33,2009-08-10 04:02:00,93," Ya I really didnt think they'd be hitting it as hard as they were but in 6-8 ft of water it was working amazing, I was fishing for bass to be honest, but as soon as I noticed the pike striking I figured wth why not lol"
