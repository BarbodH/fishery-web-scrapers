After bringing it on the deck, started right away cutting a piece of pine to square it to 6""    Another shot    Once I had cut the piece.... I adjusted the the table top to 40 degrees so that I could remove as much as material around the piece for the next step    Here is the results    View from the top    and another shot on the table    Then I got busy sanding the piece with my sander to accelerate the pace and at the end had to use sand paper by hand to mold it to my likings.... here's a few pics    and the piece sitting up right    Here's a view of one end of the spook    and both ends completed    Finally finished    Got it painted and varnished    Tested it and she floats like a real trooper!!!    Hope you enjoy as much as I had fun making it!!! Leechman  ********** UDATE **********  Today got busy again and wanted to make a popper.... needed some thinking about cutting the piece and counter sinking the mouth at the front.  Don't have any pics of when I started but here is the results  Side view   Front view   Now all I need is to buy a skirt for it and she's good to go Leechman"

370821,Leecher,2009-08-09 03:08:00,7832, Thanks Brian!!!  Only in November for the gun
370920,BillM,2009-08-09 16:27:00,17367,"Jacque, I forgot to comment on the workmanship..  It looks top notch man!!!  I mentioned the weight balance because anytime we have to put a flouro or wire leader on our spooks (we fish them all the time) it really messes up the balance..  They end up nose diving if there is any kind of chop...  We've started making 30-40lb mono leads (which float) which helps out quite a bit."
371017,Leecher,2009-08-09 22:05:00,7832, Thanks Bill!!!  No problems.... I truly appreciate your comments... it helps in tweaking the projects I work on Just added another creation to my tackle box... will be posting the pics shortly  Jacques
