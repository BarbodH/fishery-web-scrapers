As far as what I've heard/been told... Dusk brings good Walleye at the Blue Water Bridge... I mostly fish from SHORE (as mentioned) but in terms of location, I'm usually near the ""Blue Water Bridge""... or the Seaway Rd/Harbour Rd near the Marina.  I'm not asking for your favourite spots/secret locations (But if you feel like a nice Guy/Gal, I'd be happy to hear from you!) ... I was just wondering what SPECIES are plentiful this time of year (around the area).  The last time I was in Sarnia, I caught my 1st 'Brown' trout!  Pretty exciting...   Anyway, Thanks in advance to whomever gives their input!  Fella Angler, Rob"
