Made me a little choked up cuz my little boy is named Jacob and I can't image how much of an emotional rollercoaster this must be.  Kids are tough and they bounce back really quickly.  Your little boy is definately in my prayers.  Be strong for him and he'll be strong for you.   Keep us updated on how the little boy is doing.

369769,nancur373,2009-08-05 14:10:00,1211,He came out of surgery at about 7pm last night. We were allowed in at 8. He is doing great. Breathing and eating on his own. He is doing so well that if they had a room available on the 4th floor he'd be going into his own room. So we just have to wait in critical care ward until one opens. He got pretty fiesty when he woke up this morning (redhead) so they upped the morphine a little to calm him down...lol. The wife is doing well. We've been able to hold him today. I'll keep you updated as we go along. No wireless in the ward but they have a pc station for parents on the main floor. I'll keep in touch.  Thanks everyone for your prayers.  Curt

Anyone who thinks the docs don't have a heart didn't meet the guys we did. Hopefully your experience will be as rewarding.  Little kids are resilient. It's the parents who have the biggest problem with this stuff.  All the best to all of you.  As for the heart stuff - I have friends who elected to have PFO's fixed surgically just so they could scuba dive safer. Don't worry about it.  JF"

361946,nancur373,2009-07-14 12:32:00,1211,"Well the Sick Kids Hospital called yesterday to say that our youngest son Jacob's surgery has been bumped up to tomorrow. It was supposed to be Friday but I guess with some cancelations he moved up. For those of you who don't know he has double outlet right ventricle. This is a condition where the two major arteries come out of the right ventricle instead of one out the right and one out the left. He also has a rather large hole in his heart. The surgeon is hoping to be able to redirect the artery inside the heart rather than outside thus eliminating artificial conduits and reducing the chances of future surgeries. He will be six months old on Sunday. Please pray for him.  Thank you my Friends,  Curt, Yolanda, Alex and Jacob McDonald"
