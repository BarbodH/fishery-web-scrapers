370762,Ramble,2009-08-09 01:04:00,713," Where to start? Where to start?  I had an awesome season at Kesagami again. The big report will be along at some point. Right now, I’m just waiting on some more photos.  In the mean time I’ll leave you with a few photos from my season.                        I’ve only been out fishing once since I have been home. I headed out to a spot learned to fly fish, with my fly rod. The change of pace was welcome and it was great to be on home water. I didn’t land any fish of size, but I did manage a few good photos.                   Today I was digging through some old photos. My grand father had collected these over his life and have been passed on. He was an avid outdoors man to put it mildly. So I thought I would share a few of the photos with you.  He was one of 4 children and had a twin brother.   This was the primary room of his school.   This one is from the 1920’s. Barely a teenager.   We actually have a copy of one of his report cards which is good a laugh.   He told me once that the report card was as it was because he was building this. His friend that he built the cabin with turned a photo of it into a Christmas card for him once.    His father ran a creamery and did not approve of his school attendance.  (My great grandfather as a young man.)   The Wooler Creamery    Creamery Picnic   Once out of high school he spent as much time as he could in the bush. I have a map of his from 1939 of Temagami where he spent about 3 weeks with some friends.            The boat he used for checking his trap lines.       A friend from one of their trips.           Some of those photos are from before he joined up for the Second World War in 1942 and some are from after. I was digging around and found his dog tags, which I haven’t seen in about 10 years.    Anyway. I could carry on here for ever and a day. If I come across the album with his war photos I might post a few more.  I thought I’d just give you guys an update on my return to the board as well as a few photos from another generation.  Tightlines. -Dave  "

371300,scuro2,2009-08-10 19:17:00,904,Always enjoy the old outdoor pics. Who started the pipe smoking pic? Kind of like cigar pics last decade. Was it Bing Crosby? Smoking a pipe after the deer kill defines and outdoor era.
371529,solopaddler,2009-08-11 10:54:00,8605,"Well done lad, the old pic's are great and those are some nice healthy pike there. The pic of the boats in the rough water made me shudder. When I was at Kesagami the boats were always my pet peeve. Such long heavy boats and so underpowered with 9.9's. In heavy water you'd sometimes get stuck in the troughs between waves with no power to get out....not much fun."
