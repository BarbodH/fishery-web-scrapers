I was wondering, if anybody could steer me in the right direction so I dont have to spend the whole time fishing a dead zone..??  I would like to hit smallmouth bass, walleye, and well pretty much any species that will be in the area I am fishing (except for carp etc.) (A sturgeon like the one in that video would be nice lol!!)  I have a 17ft boat, so if the weather is bad I know I gotta take it easy...........  Another question, are there any bait and tackle stores local to that area that have a good selection of higher end fishing rods/equipment and live bait?  thank you in advance!  -Mark"

Drift troll 10' and deeper or beat the shore (lots of slop along the edges). Launch from Chippewa for the lower Welland. Go right and you're heading to the Niagara. Go left and you can run all the way to the Pt Robinson aqueduct. Lots of spots to try either way."

Try some of these.Upper is 10 to 20 ft deep average.Lower is deeper average 40 to 50ft . If you get a NY license open up a lot more water to fish.Hope this helps"
