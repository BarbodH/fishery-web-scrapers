365976,Fish Farmer,2009-07-25 03:01:00,2234,I can't wait to try the rod and reel in the down rigger Salmon fishing. I think safety glasses will be a must.
365979,Jonny,2009-07-25 03:11:00,1380, I checked back and I see Cudz mentioned a rod too. When I was at Dollarama today I only saw a reel. $2 for the reel.
365998,Cudz,2009-07-25 04:09:00,2652,The rods are telescopic and green in colour.  THey are $2

365719,Cudz,2009-07-24 03:50:00,2652,They do sell leaders there as well but not the ones SNAG has on his spinners.  I will be looking very close at the pics as well. **No catching fish with your normal rod and reel and then putting the dollarama rig in the pic.  This has to be legit and honest.

One store has a rod reel combo for $2 and the other has a telescopic rod for $2 and reels for $1.25 I think.  I think I am going to get the telespcopic rod.  It looks the strongest.  Not that it matters, I think the reel will be the week link.  Apart from the wire bail I didn`t anything but plastic on it."

That will leave you 6 bucks for dollar spam for bait and lures. I could be wrong though...  I do have a few Dollarama lures and they have worked. My son actually picked up a $2 rod back in the spring because he just couldn't say no to it, I rigged it up with an old 1970's Mitchel 300 reel but none of us has tried it yet.  Your dollar derby idea sounds like a good plan."
365739,Jonny,2009-07-24 11:30:00,1380," You could maybe post a picture of your fish, on a Dollarama lure, showing also the Dollarama reel and the front page of the current day's newspaper, posted to the site before, say, midnight."

365816,JohnF,2009-07-24 16:19:00,3494," Not fair. You've been researching the Dollarama lures and practicing with them. There should be a 10% penalty for ""experts"" or at least have a Pro's Division & one for us Rookies.  JF"
365821,Jonny,2009-07-24 16:43:00,1380,"I picked these up this morning...    There was a whole rack of them, and I don't think any two lures were alike.  Couldn't quite get myself to spring for the $2 reel though. I like bargains for tackle but that one kinda stuck in my craw... for now anyway.  The lures look like they might last through a fish or two but the reel looks like it would be a real challenge to catch anything with!

365824,Cudz,2009-07-24 16:53:00,2652,I bougth two lures today as well but they are WAY BETTER than yours.  I am writing up some rules and regs and I will post them here in my first post when I get them done.  If you have any changes you would like seen the rules let me know.  I will have them a little later today.  I have to go play with my kids.

You can't use anything but dollarama stuff and we have a fishing tourney. There is a good assortment of spinners, spoons, cranks, and poppers to choose from.  No live bait allowed but you can use the food from the food section.  Rod and reel is $2 and that leaves $8 for lures.  Should be funny.  I will let you know if we get this off the ground.  I wonder how long the reel will last?  Maybe 2 fish."

We'd be forced to drink a lot to overcome the embarrassment of using cheesy gear - and getting our butts kicked by newbies - - -  Oh wait! Newby - that's me!  Hey! This is a great idea. We all start off on an equal footing with no $300 rods that no one can remember the name of, or Kazillion dollar reels that have 47 bearings in the little finger spinner thingies alone, and who knows how many in the real important gutsy parts that most of us don't understand, and line that is priced by the inch and will horse a small whale, and plastic baits that cost more than it would to hand raise the little worms from babyhood, including worm diapers and teeny little soothers.  Hmmmm! Does Dollarama sell Minnkotas, GPS's & hi-def fishfinders? And I suspect that's not a baitcaster or a pin for $1.00. That'll seriously cripple some of these guys if those aren't available.

Anyone think that the time from Aug 29 to Sept 7 is a good time?  It is the last week before the kid's head back to school and it cover the long weekend.  I mean, those that cannot do a GTG and have maybe a day or 2 to get out can post the fish with said rod, reel and lure from any days in that time?  And then the others that can make a GTG post those?  these are just ideas as I think this would be too damn funny to see the pic's and see what goes on - on the water with this ""gear""...."
365711,Cudz,2009-07-24 03:41:00,2652,"Ok, so here is the deal.  I would love to have a tourney on Simcoe out of boats but it is probably not going to work.  I was thinking this.  We start a dollarama thread and we all take one day (or a couple of hours in a day, I don`t want to ruin your whole day) and we fish anywhere we want with our dollarama rigs.  When we catch a fish on our dollarama gear (IT MUST BE ALL DOLLARAMA INCLUDING ROD REEL LINE SINKERS HOOKS LURES ETC) we post pics.  Rod and reel in hand and bait in mouth if possible.  No live bait.  Just dollarama stuff.  If we don`t have a dollarama thread we can just post reports with dollarama in the title. I am buying my rod and reel tomorrow (be careful some already look broken in the packages LOL)  Looks like snag has already got a leg up on the competition.  I remember last year a bunch of blue fox and YUM stuff was on sale at dollarama.  They have a 15 piece jig set there as well as some nice hardbaits, lol.  I will buy some hooks and weights and drop shot for some trophy Simcoe smallies.  If we really want to do this right we should spend an extra $10 and go to goodwill at the same time and get some sweet swag to accompany our sweet fishing tackle."
