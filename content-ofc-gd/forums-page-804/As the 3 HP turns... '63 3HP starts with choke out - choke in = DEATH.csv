370767,wask,2009-08-09 01:11:00,174,"So had the 3HP out for the first time tonight, had it running in a trashcan and it seemed ok, but not sure if I actually pushed the choke in or if it was out the whole time. (first time I've owned an outboard, lame I know)  Put it on the boat tonight, hoping to do a test run a little fishing in the local river.  The motor starts fine with the magneto on start, then with the choke out I can swing it to fast and it runs fine, choke still out.  When I push the choke in, it sounds like it is going to turn into a champ and take off and then if fizzles, sort of coughs and dies.  I would think, and I'm not mechanic or even really knowledgable, but either it is a carb problem or could the mix be wrong?  Or could it be something else?"
370772,BillM,2009-08-09 01:18:00,17367,Main jet could be completely clogged or you could have a float height issue in the carb bowl.  I'd take the carb apart and give it a good soak and cleaning...
370779,Rich,2009-08-09 01:23:00,3927,"If it's the same as my old 3 horse, you push the button in to choke it. Pulled out means it's not choked, which means it's running fine.  If all else fails, clean the carb!"
370788,Greencoachdog,2009-08-09 01:41:00,8163,Yup!... starved for fuel= nasty carb!!!  If you don't have carb experience it should only cost you $35-$50 at a good marine repair place.
370795,wask,2009-08-09 01:52:00,174,"Is it a really hard thing to do?  It seems like a pretty simple motor but if it's too hard, I'll consider taking it in.   "
370815,camillj,2009-08-09 03:01:00,1988,Does the ball collapse ... or go soft ... have you tried pumping the ball when you give it gas ... could also be a problem with the fuel line/tank/pump valve ... its amazing how often the motor is fine its the tank/fuel line that are the cause of the problem ....
370817,wask,2009-08-09 03:03:00,174,My tank is on the motor.  So... I don't think I have access to any of that...  
370898,Sinker,2009-08-09 14:35:00,8692,"Go to your local NAPA dealer and get a can of seafoam. Mix it about 2oz/liter of gas, and let it burn that for a while. Take it for a good long ride at full throttle. That will clean A LOT of crap out of your fuel system. Be prepared to see a lot of smoke.  S."
370907,Black_Blade,2009-08-09 15:44:00,258,"As I posted in another thread, a good repair forum to check out The Marine Doctor  Very helpful site for this type of thing."
370948,JohnAB,2009-08-09 17:59:00,178,"Definitely a fuel/air problem. Either your air setting is way too high or you are starving for fuel. Clean the carbs good including the jets, set your air and check your float height etc."
370959,wask,2009-08-09 18:47:00,174,"Set your air?  Sorry, not sure what that means.  I don't think I can adjust that on this motor though...  "
