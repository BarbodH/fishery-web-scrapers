370405,Joey,2009-08-07 01:38:00,9122, I'm not actually sure what kind of snake it is.  I think its a water snake but could be wrong.
370448,ravinerat,2009-08-07 11:19:00,64,Quite the tallent on the bucktails. They are some real beauties. I love the Lund pic too. My dream boat when mine grows up.  RR
370462,tonyb,2009-08-07 13:03:00,1637,Looks like a great trip! good to see the Lund getting put to good use.  Does the Verado still make you grin each time you run it?  Tony
370469,Joey,2009-08-07 13:44:00,9122," It's a dream Tony, just a dream"
370524,tnt,2009-08-07 19:25:00,63,Looks like an awsome time!
370587,Squid,2009-08-08 02:22:00,1656,Excellent report Joey!! Great pictures and that is one  sweet looking boat!!!
370615,Spiel,2009-08-08 11:53:00,9065,"I've been trying to avoid this thread on account of I couldn't go. But admittedly I was curious, wish I'd been there. Thanks for the expected state of depression Joey."
370618,Joey,2009-08-08 12:04:00,9122,  Well that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said......... sniff sniff
370619,Joey,2009-08-08 12:06:00,9122," Hey Chris, we bumped into your friend up there.  He said you were very close to going.  Wish you had of.  He didn't quite have the same sense of humour that you do"
370620,Whopper,2009-08-08 12:18:00,2174,Glad to see you and Paul out and about  Sweet looking ride  Paul with a make over    thought maybe you found a new fella
371072,ccmtcanada,2009-08-10 01:20:00,7971,Sweet looking baits Joey!!!  And yet another great Lakair report.  Looks like a great time was had...gotta try one of them cabins one of these times!
371089,lunkerbasshunter,2009-08-10 01:40:00,2585,great report some really great pics there!  Cheers!
371183,Fish Farmer,2009-08-10 12:21:00,2234,Great report and pictures. Nice looking Ride. One of these days I'm going to take Chris on his offer.
370110,Joey,2009-08-06 02:35:00,9122,"Paul and I decided to spend the long weekend in a cabin up at Lakair.  So much easier than tenting it and it was much more relaxing.  We arrived Friday night about 10:30 p.m. and left Monday afternoon.  The musky did not cooperate this trip, but the pike did of course.  Only took a couple of pics of the pike, because as I've said before, they pretty much look the same  I made a few new baits in the days before we left and felt confident they were going to be ""the lure.""  Not even a musky sniff, but they didn't sniff any other baits either, so I didn't feel too bad.        We stayed in cabin 11 for the first time, the one right at the launch.  What a great cabin, with a great view, which included being able to see our boat the whole time.  That meant we didn't have to take all our gear out every time.         Saturday was quite pleasant, well compared to the rest of the weekend anyhow.  No weather report I heard mentioned the wind and overcast/rainy weather that we were to experience from Saturday night on.  If it wasn't rainy, it was damn windy.  I suppose it beats melting in the hot sun all day, but swimming was definately out    Caught a few pike Saturday and a few pickerel at night before the big wind blew in.  That was the theme for the whole weekend, a few pike during the day, a few pickerel in the evening.  Except for the 19 inch pickerel Paul pulled out of Muskrat while trolling a musky lure     I didn't get a chance to take a pic of the pickerel.  It was in the slot so back she went nice and fast.  This was the biggest pike of the weekend.        I tried to get a good shot of the osprey, but with a moving boat, its not that easy on full zoom.  The talons on these birds are just amazing.        Good old Digger seemed preoccupied with a rock cut at the dock.  I finally had to inspect and found out what the fuss was all about.        A few scenery and other shots.              Some loons with their babies.        The almost full moon didn't seem to help the musky/pickerel fishing much    Cormorant problem, what cormorant problem    And finally, the sunset/dusk shot, before the mosquito's came out in full force (in August   )    It was a nice relaxing weekend and ended all too soon, as anyone who's been there knows.  We certainly didn't want to leave.  Cheers,  Joey"
370116,jediangler,2009-08-06 02:44:00,1923,Great report and fantastic pics Joey. Those are some good looking bucktails too.
370119,rbaquial,2009-08-06 02:52:00,968,"Awesome report! I wish/need to head to a place that has fish of that magnitude!!  Btw, I've been meaning to ask you (Since I've joined) - What the heck are you doing in the Cooler?"
370122,kickingfrog,2009-08-06 02:55:00,8333,"Nice photos Joey.  I've seen some big flocks of cormorants on the south east side of Nipissing, but not that many in the west."
370123,Joey,2009-08-06 02:56:00,9122, Just chillin
370124,rbaquial,2009-08-06 02:56:00,968," LMAO! Seriously, eh! Hahahaha...I love that picture btw! Its funny as h3ll..."
370125,kickingfrog,2009-08-06 02:57:00,8333, Ha Ha. That's the first thing I asked her when I met her at Lakair last year.
370132,ciceri,2009-08-06 03:20:00,535,"Nice report, and nice boat!"
370149,Rich Clemens,2009-08-06 10:21:00,3131,Great report Joey.   We're already looking forward to our next trip up there. Oh yeah .. Love your sytlist Paul.
370166,John,2009-08-06 11:49:00,2956,"Thanks Joey, great report. Barbara & I are headed to the West Arm this Sat for a week. Rumour has it there will be a few other familiar faces up there too.  Nice talons by the way........."
370183,Greencoachdog,2009-08-06 12:44:00,8163,"Great report and pics Joey!!!  That's a pretty nice Pike Paul got!... were y'all trolling or casting when it hit?  How were the bugs at this time of year?   I remember the first time you posted that pic of you sitting in the cooler, I got a good chuckle out of that!"
370199,Joey,2009-08-06 13:12:00,9122," Hey Glen, we were casting when Paul got that Pike, in a shallow, calm bay.  The bugs were terrible.  The only saving grace was the gale force winds that kept them at bay most of the time.  The one night when we were pickerel fishing in a sheltered bay was bad tho.  They came out as soon as dusk hit and there was no fishing after that.  It was unbelievable.  We raced back to the dock and sprinted to the cabin"
370203,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-06 13:19:00,1022,"  Ya they were pretty bad at times, but not the whole weekend I found. The one night I went into the fish hut to fillet a couple, and I didn't even cut out the rib bone because I was being bitten so bad."
370207,TJQ,2009-08-06 13:28:00,7806,"Nice report Joey!!  A good time as always, nice baits as well!!!"
370221,highdrifter,2009-08-06 13:58:00,2534,AWESOME as usual Joey..  I'll waste company time for you anyday!!  cheers HD
370229,blaque,2009-08-06 14:34:00,2419,"That looks like a perfect weekend, aside from the bugs. And  I know what you mean about having a cabin with a view of the boat...........its the ultimate in rest and relaxation.......dock the boat turn the key off and step on the front porch. No loading and unloading of gear every time its lunch time. And no worries of waves slamming your ride into the dock is even more comforting. It allows for complete......worry free .....relaxation.  And im sorry, but of all your pics......i find this is the most georgeous of them all. Im sure you just sat back a time or two on the front porch just saying to yourself........WOW, i cant believe that beautiful thing is mine   You are a VERY LUCKY couple to be able to attain something like that. I can only dream for now.........but someday i hope to replace my vessel with the latest version of that very boat. Its absolutely beautiful. "
370247,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-06 16:07:00,1022,"I left all my gear and even my fish finder in all weekend without a problem. Have people stolen things in the past? Actually if you look at the pic above, directly infront of Joey's boat is mine and you can see my tackle bag on the left."
370255,Victor,2009-08-06 16:25:00,1609,Those lures look awesome!! Definitely caught me even if it didn't catch any muskie lol!  And I love that T-shirt too!  Thanks for sharing with us.
370256,Joey,2009-08-06 16:26:00,9122," Ya, that's funny we were even talking and fishing beside you and didn't know you were an OFC'r  I think there were a few incidents of things being stolen before.  I think one time all of Kevin's engines were taken from his boats on one night.  Very unfortunate that there are people out there that would do something like that, but there are."
370288,doubleheader,2009-08-06 18:33:00,497,"Hi Joey, nice report.  Glad to see you liked our old cabin 11, great cabin except when it's hot in the evening and then you just pray for the sun to go down. Looks like Kevin still hasn't found the time to paint those replaced boards on the deck though. I see Digger is still enthralled by that water snake on the dock, I almost stepped on it twice on our visit but I'm kind of glad to see it's still hangn around."
370292,Jonny,2009-08-06 18:54:00,1380,Nice wildlife and scenery shots... that's half the day right there. (Except for those damned cormorants.)  And those are some purty bucktails!
370304,misfish,2009-08-06 19:31:00,29133,Got to love that camera eh J. Great photos and report.
370319,mepps,2009-08-06 20:07:00,1301,Awesome stuff!
370358,laszlo,2009-08-06 22:35:00,487,What kind of snake is that by the way? Rattle Snake?
370359,Terry,2009-08-06 22:41:00,14456,good report some great pictures oh and I love your boat
