371314,misfish,2009-08-10 19:48:00,29133,"With the new boat, we plan on staying at some transient docks and there are electrical hook ups. I dont have one of them plug in,s on my boat. With the purchace of a few items which require power,I would like to hook up something that would allow me to use the power supplied at the dock and not my cranking battery. I have made up the power cord for the hook up.30 amp 125 volt.(not to worry,it was made waterproof by our resident electrician). What else do I need to do so I can run the power through the boat ,without using up my cranking battery, like I said.  Thanks"
371319,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-10 19:51:00,947,What kinda boat is it again Misfish?  I would look into a bank charger that way you can just plug it in and forget about it. Well until you leave for the main body of water lol

371326,bassjnkie,2009-08-10 20:00:00,1101,"Let me understand. You are hooking up the power so you can run the boat, eg. using lights through the 125v connection, not the battery. If that's correct you will need a 125V to 12v converter."
371327,misfish,2009-08-10 20:01:00,29133," Yes, the lights and dvd player and cd player.  125V to 12v converter? Whats involved with this set up? Do I just hook it up to the cranking battery? Thanks"
371330,bassjnkie,2009-08-10 20:09:00,1101,"I know ways to do it for my uses. But for your application give the RV stores a call. they use the setup you need in house boats and RV's. All that is requires is a selector switch, which you turn one way for battery and the other to the converter. And of course power plugged in to the converter via a plug."
371354,Terry,2009-08-10 21:32:00,14456,so  you want a 120 to 12v power supply they aren't cheap.. your lights and dvd are 12v  it would be easier to just bring 120 lights and tv and what not and hook them up to the 120 supply at the dock  or get a good automatic battery charger and hook it up to the batteries if it doesn't need much power it will supply 2 amps if you need more the charger will increase the amps as the lights and tv need them
371379,misfish,2009-08-10 23:02:00,29133, So what you are saying is just put on a onboard charger and let it run the night while we have things on? I bought an extra cranking battery just incase.  Thanks again.
371384,danbouck,2009-08-10 23:10:00,4380,Getting a 120 12v power supply will run you about $50 but a battery charger is almost the same. Terry is right it will be a heck of a lot easier to just get 120v lights and plug them into the supply at the dock. Then you don't have to mess around with the boat wiring.
371390,misfish,2009-08-10 23:19:00,29133,"But if everything runs of the cranking battery,then a auto charger,will do right? While we sleep the night it will put everything back to norm?  Thanks again."
371393,Terry,2009-08-10 23:23:00,14456,"well yeah if the charger doesn't  have the balls to keep up with use, then over night while no power is being used the battery will be charged by the charger..but your lights and tv and dvd shouldn't take more then 10 amps  12 Volt DC Amp Ratings Appliance or Accessory 	Estimated Amps Aisle Light 	1 Amp CO Detector 	1 Amp Fluorescent Light 	1-2 Amps Furnace 	10-12 Amps LP Gas Leak Detector 	1 Amp Overhead lights (Per Bulb) 	1 Amp Porch Light 	1 Amp Power Roof Vent 	1.5 Amps Radio/Stereo 	4 Amps Range Hood (Fan & Light) 	2-3 Amps Refrigerator (LP Gas Mode) 	1.5- 2 Amps Security System 	1 Amp Television (12 volt) 	4-5 Amps TV Antenna Booster 	<1 Amp TV Antenna Booster 12 Volt outlet 	Up to 8 Amps Variable Speed Ceiling / Vent Fan 	4 Amps VCR Recorder / Player 	2 Amps Water Pump 	4 Amp"
371407,danbouck,2009-08-10 23:37:00,4380, Yes just make sure the charger has balls and you should be fine.
371414,misfish,2009-08-10 23:45:00,29133,"Thanks again guys. When I get the boat back from getting a new look,Im going to look close at what my options are. Be nice to plug and play.  Thanks again."
371417,danbouck,2009-08-11 00:04:00,4380,If you get a charger rated for 12-15A you will be ok. Then add in a 12v-120AC power inverter and you can go ahead and plug just about anything into it.   Charger  Power Inverter  These are just the CT ones. BPS and other places sell different brands.
371423,misfish,2009-08-11 00:13:00,29133,"Thanks Dan. I have the inverter, as I can play my dvd with the cig lighter plug in thing quad set up..  Im trying to get way from using the battery.   Thanks again."
371425,Fisherman,2009-08-11 00:16:00,7201,"Do a bit of research when or if you buy an inverter, there are different quality levels, MSW or modified sine wave inverters are not the greatest for electronic items such as microwave/TV/DVd's etc, you are better off with a true full sine wave inverter, they cost more but don't cost you in the long run."
371450,Greencoachdog,2009-08-11 01:19:00,8163,"Touch yer tongue to it... if yer nads don't curdle, then it's okay!!!"
371512,Sinker,2009-08-11 06:02:00,8692,"How many batteries are in the boat now? Im assuming just one cranking?  If it was me, I'd add another battery, with a two bank charger. Run all your toys off one battery, crank with the other, and just plug in the charger at night.  The proper way to do it is to get the switch and converter, but thats gonna cost $$.  S."
