370644,Musky or Specks,2009-08-08 16:09:00,2710,"Congrats on the first set of wheels. This was mine    The freedoms it brought to go fishing was awesome. But even with the back seats folded down it was still not the greatest of places for ""sleeping"". Enjoy the freedom having your own car brings but be prepared for the repair bills with all the k's you put on it going to your fishing holes."
