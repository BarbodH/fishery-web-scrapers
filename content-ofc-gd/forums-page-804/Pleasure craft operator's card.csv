If that person or organization is not able to supply you with a replacement card then you have to take the course again from an other issuer to get a new card."
370624,POLLIWOGG,2009-08-08 12:43:00,835,When you get your card photocopy the 'ell out of it..  I think providers now must keep a data base but I might be wrong and a lot of providers ignore the rules.
370625,Terry,2009-08-08 12:52:00,14456,"my card started to fall apart, seems my wallet was too much for it and there was a round indent in it, but that's another story.  anyway, I sent for another card and for a couple bucks more they send two, so now I have 3 cards I should be good for a while"
370628,smally21,2009-08-08 13:29:00,993,that is good to know.  i dont know if it has always been this way but the online exam is offering 2 cards when you write your exam.

370639,4thgen,2009-08-08 15:42:00,157,"I lost mine a couple of years ago, called the provider and they had no record of me! Luckily I've found the card since then.  In my opinion there should be a registry of all card holders regardless of the provider.  Imagine losing your drivers license and having to take another drivers test to get a new one..   What a stupid system..."
370876,pikehunter,2009-08-09 13:06:00,1659,The topic of this thread is more evidence of how much a Micky Mouse system of boater competency the government came up with. Maybe they hired Goofy write up the rules?
371092,John Bacon,2009-08-10 01:45:00,3277,"  Or, if you are any good on photoshop you can just make a new card.  There is no registry, there is no standard format for the cards; thus, there is not way for a cop to tell if a card is legitamate.  The boaters card is the worst piece of crap legislation that I have ever seen."
