371510,Sinker,2009-08-11 05:49:00,8692,"John Prine is one of my all time favourites. I was born and raised on his stuff. I find it amazing how many people have never heard of him, but when you break out the flat top and do one of his tunes around the campfire, it gets everyones attention. The man see's and sings about things most people would never notice, but we've all experienced in some way or another. A true legend in my eyes.  This one is a favourite to me.......    Frig, I think I""m gonna pull out the guitar and have a little jam now  S."
