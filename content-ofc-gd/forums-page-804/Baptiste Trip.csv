We only had a trolling motor on the boat so we were kind of limited as to how far from the launch we could fish, but we did alright.   "
370929,Paully,2009-08-09 17:08:00,712,Did you catch the same fish twice?  The sunset in the pike pic is nice...

371022,GeorgeJ,2009-08-09 22:22:00,207,"good report, I fished Baptiste last week, we caught Pike, Pickerel and small mouth. Although we didn't catch any we saw a floating dead perch so they must be in there too. It was my first time on Baptiste."
