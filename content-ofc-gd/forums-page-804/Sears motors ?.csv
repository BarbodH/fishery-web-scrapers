371111,splashhopper,2009-08-10 02:33:00,2931,"the guy bought a bigger boat and motor.... unloading a 5.5hp sears motor cheap... with an 8foot cartopper boat....  any thoughts on the old sears motor... (we will be test running it in the river before I drop ""all"" the money on it....."
371122,Jonny,2009-08-10 03:08:00,1380,My dad had a 3 HP Sears  (60's vintage) for many years. Good little motor.
371124,sturgman,2009-08-10 03:18:00,249, I was raised boat smart from my Dad many years ago on a 6 hp Viking motor pushing a 16 ft. Geisler cedar strip..... I may be wrong but wasnt the Viking series a Sears product?
371129,Jonny,2009-08-10 03:35:00,1380,The Viking was an Eaton's brand. It was Chrysler under the hood.
371162,Alumacraft,2009-08-10 10:41:00,139,"If fished the lower niagara for years, all year round out a 14' mirrocraft and a 1972 ted williams (sears) 7.5 hp never had a problem. Motor started fine every time out."
371176,Greencoachdog,2009-08-10 12:00:00,8163,"If you buy it, buy it as disposable. You can't get parts for Sears or Chrysler motors anymore!  I learned that the hard way."
371178,Spiel,2009-08-10 12:11:00,9065,I had a 5 horse Ted Williams (Sears) that would have served me better as an anchor!
371181,Greencoachdog,2009-08-10 12:17:00,8163,"  ... now that you mention it, yeah."
371187,Jonny,2009-08-10 12:39:00,1380," I should have picked up on this yesterday!  I can still remember fishing as a kid when my dad had his first motor - a 7.5 Elgin he went halves on with my uncle - and we used to rent 16 ft cedar strips from Laronde Creek Lodge to put it on. I'm not sure if they were Geislers. Not much speed with those little motors on a heavy cedar strip, but we thought it was great! (Early 50's). Those were the days when you could tell the Americans by the West Bend outboards they used to use."
371259,boatman,2009-08-10 16:45:00,350,Condition is everything. Lots of these motors are still in service. Age will determine parts availability. Don't expect much. Resale is very low. If I was buying the package I'd pay whatever I thought the boat alone was worth.
371347,Letterstorm,2009-08-10 21:11:00,3,Air cooled I think. Everyone on the lake will hear you talking to your partner...except your partner.
371355,dave524,2009-08-10 21:36:00,4508,"  Friend's dad had an  ""Elgin"" in the early 60's about 5 horse, pretty sure it was aircooled. Looked identical to the "" Eska "" brand motors  that were advertised in dad's outdoors mags. Probably they made them for Sear's or so we thought."
371520,boatman,2009-08-11 10:27:00,350,"Kissel, Westbend, Chrysler and Eska have all made outboards for Sears. Westbend and Eska both made air-cooled models. The 5.5 hp is probably an air-cooled Westbend."
371600,Bob,2009-08-11 14:25:00,370,"I ran a 5.5 Eska for years.  Reliable but with a tendency to vibrate the screws loose.  Always had to carry a screwdriver to tighten things up when they started to rattle. As already stated, they're noisy. I believe the power head was a Tecumseh from Wisconsin. Should be able to find parts still."
