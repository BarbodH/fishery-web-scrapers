370729,bucktail,2009-08-09 00:10:00,1857,"That was great!!!! Everytime I am in the river I wonder how many of those dino's are underneath me, I assume that was lower river?"
370732,Leecher,2009-08-09 00:22:00,7832,Awesome Steve Congrats on your first dino    Real beauty!!! Leechman
370794,BillM,2009-08-09 01:48:00,17367,"We snagged a sturgeon years ago when fishing the sandbars for lakers...  Took a good 2hrs to get it close to the boat, estimated at around 10ft or so...  Biggest thing I've ever seen in fresh water..  We had a little floatilla of boats around us wondering what we had on that was taking so long to bring in.  Got it up to the boat, tail out of the water and gave the rod a good snap and the shad rap came free..."
370902,Paully,2009-08-09 14:50:00,712,Totally Cool!!  Is there many sturgon in the niagara river?...
370919,BillM,2009-08-09 16:21:00,17367, I would guess it's probably one of the best places to fish for them in southern Ontario..  Just a guess though.
370945,Steve Piggott,2009-08-09 17:51:00,196, Sturgeon is closed all year round on the Niagara.I have fished the river for 20 years and that is my first.I know of a few others caught on roe.

371559,Rizzo,2009-08-11 12:48:00,4754,"I have seen one on the underwater camera while drifting down the upper niagara, maybe just a bit smaller than that one. Very nice!"
371563,bridge,2009-08-11 12:56:00,54,Nice fish.  I Caught a sturgen in the whirl pool last year on roe about that big.  Took a long time to get up on a 10' noodle rod.
