371493,HTHM,2009-08-11 03:44:00,4082,"What is the law for recovering a boat that has gone ashore. I saw a 20+footer on the shore of Lake Erie today that had a boat nearby that was obviously watching it. There is no doubt that this was a wreck, the whole boat was up on shore and not at all able to navigate under its own power. Can I walking on shore lay claim to the vessel by going on board and recovering it? This is not a moral question, but rather a legal one."
371517,Terry,2009-08-11 09:49:00,14456,"well not sure that it would fall under marine salvage laws it's on dry land and someone owns the land, which would give some control to the land owner  if I beach a boat because it is in trouble of sinking, could someone claim salvage rights on it, I don;t think so but if it is under water or adrift, that's a different story.... just my opinion"
371528,bigugli,2009-08-11 10:51:00,6138,"It's been beached. Hard to press a salvage claim.  Adrft, you would be within your right to do so. However, you may only claim a fixed percentage of the vessels worth as your salvage fee unless no one claims the vessel. If unclaimed, a percentage reverts to the Crown. There are , again, fixed time frames to follow. You really do need to talk to a lawyer."

371541,BITEME,2009-08-11 11:58:00,1968,I dont believe ther are salvage laws for the great lakes
371542,HTHM,2009-08-11 12:02:00,4082,"I had no intention of trying to recover it, but it got me wondering."
371544,Garnet,2009-08-11 12:09:00,2056,I found a boat on Scugog 30 years ago and learned. Never turn it over to the police. Phone local cops make a police report after 30 days you can make whats called a Quick Claim and that gives you ownership.  The police will want to pickup property up just say no.  Garnet
