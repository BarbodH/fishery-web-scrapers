370973,rbaquial,2009-08-09 19:43:00,968,I posted the SAME EXACT question too! hahaha  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=34960  I'll be fishing from SHORE though; that might be the only difference.
371002,ch312,2009-08-09 21:37:00,1590,ill be fishing from shore as well
371026,rbaquial,2009-08-09 22:38:00,968,When are you heading to Sarnia? I may be heading this weekend... Leaving Friday I think.
371118,ch312,2009-08-10 02:58:00,1590,hmmm...i guess nobody fishes that river?  ill be there monday to friday. look for a tall almost bald guy with a shorter native guy
371141,rbaquial,2009-08-10 04:07:00,968,"Yeah, doesn't look like we have anybody that does....  Monday? like... Tomorrow Monday? (Aug.10)? I'm going to be heading there Friday (Aug.14) till Sunday (Aug.16).  EDIT: The only thing I know about the area... under the ""Blue Water Bridge""... there's a particular spot that the locals go to and fish for Walleye w/ Power Grubs - Hope that helps."
