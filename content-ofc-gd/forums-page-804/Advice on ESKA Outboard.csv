It gave me 100's of hours of trouble-free service but I stopped using it about 6 years ago because it was developing rust in the integral gas tank. I put in an in-line a fuel filter and used it that way a few times but then stored it away. Later I got a 2 HP Johnson and just never started up the Eska again.  I'd like to get it running again because I now use 2 boats interchangeably and would like a kicker on each, without having to move the 2 HP all the time.  Question --- anybody know what I can do about the rust problem in the gas tank? It flakes off and gets into the gasoline. There must be a better solution than just a fuel filter."
369647,Dara,2009-08-05 02:38:00,3052,  I have the same sorta problem with a 2 evenrude about the same age. It hasn't been used in years. If I can't find a new tank. I'm going to try to adapt a plastic gas can to it. It will look goofy.
371123,Jonny,2009-08-10 03:18:00,1380,I'm still hoping for an idea or two about what to do re: this problem.
371134,danbo,2009-08-10 03:59:00,2646,Remove the tank..drain it..then take to a car repair shop & ask the mechanic to blast it with an air hose. Shake it all out & go home.
