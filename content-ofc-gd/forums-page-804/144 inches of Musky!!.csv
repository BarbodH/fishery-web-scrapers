371029,Wendel,2009-08-09 22:45:00,213,"Just got in, so this won't be a long ramble.  Weather was nice, pretty windy some days.  We had alot of family for visits so we couldn't fish as much as we wanted to.  I guess I'm pretty good guide though, I did manage to put my wife on 6 fish, 4 of them were of excellent size and girth..  Here's some of the pics...  A skinny 45    A fat 48    And her best and our boat's best... a 51    Almost all of our fish were on the same lure,  a perch super shad rap...  Also, what the hell are these turtles up to... I thought they were fighting.... she thought they were mating... maybe there were just arguing lol..  pretty big snappers, not the biggest I've seen but the largest I've seen there..    "

371032,Whitespinnerbait,2009-08-09 22:54:00,2038,Very Nice Looking Muskies right there.....
371036,Gerritt,2009-08-09 23:17:00,6129,awesome report! but one question? and not being a smart-ass.... are those special gloves that protect the fish?
371040,Wendel,2009-08-09 23:23:00,213,In theory I suppose they help protect the fish. In reality they protect my girlish hands more! I was tired of getting my fingers shreded by teeth and fins and gills etc. They have saved me from alot of pain
371047,Gerritt,2009-08-10 00:00:00,6129,  Good enough answer for me! thanks for the report... I enjoyed reading it!  Now to get through Solo's EPIC saga.... too many reports to mull over lately! (Jealous!)   G

371265,Wendel,2009-08-10 17:02:00,213,"  Steve,  no doubt, the wife was huffing and puffing she was so excited. I guess I should take the time to tell the story of the one that got away. It was the biggest fish we've ever had on the end of a rod. She fought it for about 7 minutes which is really long for a musky.  It got to the boat and ran back out three times. Finally it got to the boat and decided to go under, it pulled the wifes rod down and as soon as the rod hit the boat it exploded into two pieces... The fish was still on so I grabbed the line and was going to horse it in, it was right at the boat, but when I let off on the line to pull in the broken half of the rod... bye bye fishy.  We were going to invite you down for a day, but we had some problems with the boat.  It seems my motor is too heavy for my boat, so I had to take it in for service and get a fancy bracket made for it.  Didn't know for sure what my schedule was going to be...  Mark"
371283,mistaredone,2009-08-10 18:14:00,913,The ones that get way are sometimes as good or better than the ones we land. The broken rod if you still have it would make a great wall mount. Lol!!  Jenn is ready to have the baby any day so I'm land locked for the next few weeks.  Congrats again on some big fish.
