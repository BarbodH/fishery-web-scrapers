370805,misfish,2009-08-09 02:43:00,29133,"I paid to watch the last one,100. I think Grif can win. As for Penn, Kenny should kick his donkey shark skin ass."
370834,crankbait,2009-08-09 04:03:00,82,"Wow Silva dismantled Griffin like it was no problem. KO in the first round, very impressive at 205."
370858,Terry,2009-08-09 10:47:00,14456,Silva made it look like Griffin didn't show up for the fight
