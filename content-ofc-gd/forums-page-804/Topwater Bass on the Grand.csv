I worked downstream to where I exit the river and after one swipe at it this guy head butted my lure.  Pretty close to the eyes, but no damage.    Healthy fish, good scrapper considering the hook location.    The camera had been a jinx for me lately so I was glad to land this guy and post up some pics  Paul"
