1012388,Rizzo,2017-08-31 03:14:00,4754,"We used to have a cottage near there on ""Windfall"" lake. I never fished Roberts because it seemed way more populated than many other lakes in the area. The spots I went to (and they had easy access) all offered great pike and bass so I never needed to bother with Roberts"
