1011884,farsider,2017-08-22 21:56:00,456,Disgusting.  65 days in the water.  880 kg of fish.  http://windsor.ctvnews.ca/lake-erie-fishing-boat-captain-fined-for-not-retrieving-net-from-water-1.3556780
1011888,grimsbylander,2017-08-22 22:08:00,3016,"That's $2.58/lb!! There's the problem right there. That POS should be covering the entire cost of the investigation, the court costs and as a minimum, the cost of 1940 lbs of fresh fish. Great system we have...let's spend a $100,000 to recoup $5000. Grrrrrrrr"
1011889,fishindevil,2017-08-22 22:22:00,6254,that's a pretty pathetic fine ....unreal.......
1011893,manitoubass2,2017-08-22 22:56:00,11391,Agreed grimbsy.
1011898,LostAnotherOne,2017-08-22 23:35:00,956,I say get yourself a water proof drill and find his boat.
1011899,OhioFisherman,2017-08-23 00:08:00,6623,""" The abandoned net contained approximately 880 kilograms of several species of fish including walleye, yellow perch, lake sturgeon, white bass and white perch, in various stages of decomposition.""  Lake Sturgeon are an endangered species here in Ohio and possession prohibited, I wonder what they would  fine a recreational angler for having just one?"
1011900,manitoubass2,2017-08-23 00:24:00,11391,No idea of the laws there. But if caught in NW Ontario you'd be fishing up s**** creek without a paddle
1011901,buick14,2017-08-23 00:30:00,741,This makes me absolutely sick.  I'm with Grimsby on this one
1011951,zenon11,2017-08-23 16:23:00,75,Sounds like he just forgot it in the water. The lack of intent is probably why the fine was so light.
1012258,outllaw,2017-08-29 15:19:00,1232,lol its the cost of doing business for commercial operators. the fines never equal the resources lost.
