1012161,the spirit of fishing,2017-08-28 15:23:00,141," I won't be pursuing the 6 cyl engine. The Ram 8 cyl appears to have lots of muscle.However the fuel economy is worse than a Ford or GM with similar capability. Brand loyalty isn't important to me so any of these are good and I'll see where my search leads me now. For those that suggested the diesel engines, I have given thought to them but I think the extra expense is too high. It's nice to be able to reach out to a group of people willing to help steer you in the right direction. Thanks to all!"
1012193,JoePa,2017-08-28 20:36:00,179,When I bought my 2005 F350 Super Duty I was told that 70% of the people buying that truck ended buying a diesel - I went with a gas engine - 5.4 V8 - the reason I did that was because I also travel all over Canada with my truck camper pulling a boat and always have a lot of extra gas in case I need it - I have a 13 gallon tank in the boat and an extra 12 gallon tank for the boat - sometimes you can't always get diesel fuel if your way up in the boondocks - besides down here for some reason diesel fuel costs more that gas - I always think I made a good choice especially when you hear of the troubles connected with owning a diesel
1012194,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-28 21:11:00,8243,"I had a Chevy 3500 diesel 20 some odd years ago. I always had to carry 5 gallons around with me as even in southern On. it wasn't available at every filling station. I hate, too strong a word, I strongly dislike with a passion that incessant clanking, cackling, carbuncklement diesel sound. When I was a kid our bedroom was about 20 feet from a bus stop and they sat there idling for what seemed like hours, the sound and smell of the diesel engine reminds me I shared 2 beds with 5 brothers and numerous cousins on weekends. My first ever pay I bought a Pup tent.  Haven't heard from you here for a while JoePa, good to see your still with us."
1012220,Raf,2017-08-29 01:40:00,3495,"20 years ago was 20 years ago, technology & infrastructure progresses  picked up my new colorado diesel today and achieved 7.7l / 100 (that's a little over 30 US mpg) on the 150km drive from the dealer.  it's only going to get better as the motor gets broken in.  i wouldn't make a habit of pulling a 5000lb horse trailer with it -- eventhough it's rated for 7600lbs -- that's what full size trucks are for. but it will handle a moderate load just fine.  i hear GM will be putting an oil burner in the silverado/sierra 1500 in the next couple of years, i think it will sell well, like the ram eco diesel."

Lots of guys I work with have the hemi and love the power of it. Fuel economy isn't too bad either.  Regardless, good luck with your purchase."

Hands down the 5.0 gets better gas mileage however the turbo series is boosting the truck at 14 psi will yield 3.5 plus 1.75 for a displacement of 5.25 in theory a 10 % loss is expected so it is roughly a 5.0 under boost. both are up to the job and with further tuning the 3.5 turbo in the raptor is rated at 450 H.p and 510 FT lb of torque. There is lots of room left in the turbo series using tuning and a few mechanical tweeks. One of the thing people forget is displacement at atmospheric pressure is easily overridden by increasing the inlet pressure and increasing fuel rate at the same time. With the computers now a days mapping the spark, fuel and o2 is easily done. The second benefit of a smaller cubic inch motor is it can spool up quicker because it has less friction and mass to accelerate.  Turbo lag which is minimal due to the space age materials we use and advances in design are not the same concern as yesteryear.  Art"

1012101,the spirit of fishing,2017-08-27 01:26:00,141,"Hi all. I'm hoping to get some advice to help me choose a truck while all these sales are on. Presently I'm looking at the Ram pick ups. I like the fuel economy of their 3.6 l V6 but I'm concerned the torque rating of 269 lb-ft won't be enough to tow a travel trailer of around 5500 lbs throughout Canada. Properly equipped the specs say this truck is rated to tow 7420 lbs., my concern is that this rating is a marketing tool and can only be met with a tailwind going downhill. Hope I can get some help from anyone who knows about this stuff."
1012104,chris.brock,2017-08-27 02:31:00,4053, I have that engine (Pentastar) in my Jeep. I'd like to see one on the dyno because it doesn't feel anywhere close to the output numbers they are claiming.
1012105,boombap,2017-08-27 02:37:00,310,I would steer clear of that engine if your planning on towing 5000 pounds for any extended amount of time.  Not saying it won't do it but it won't do it well.
1012108,OhioFisherman,2017-08-27 05:50:00,6623,"Over the years I had a total of 3 GM Astro - Safari vans with a 4.3 v-6 which had similar torque numbers. They were fine for pulling my boat (roughly 1500 lbs total weight, b/m/t and gear). They could handle, barely, pulling my tandem axle utility trailer loaded with a cord and a quarter of fresh cut slabwood ( roughly 5000 lbs ) 20 miles from the sawmill home.  To pull a 5500 lb trailer around Canada? you are going to want at least a mid sized  v - 8, a diesel might be better. I have a 2500 series GM van with a small v-8, no doubt that it would pull a 5000lb load better, but if I had planned on pulling a weight like that around regularly I would have gone with a bigger motor.  Those little motors have to work hard to pull weight."
1012111,porkpie,2017-08-27 07:26:00,2521,"Most folks experience regret when they purchase a pickup truck that 1)  doesn't have a V8 and 2) doesn't have 4 wheel drive.  Not all, but most!  Just some input from a long time truck owner, who's buddies have tried every cost saving measure that ended in buyers remorse."
1012112,Raf,2017-08-27 11:01:00,3495,Get the diesel if you will be towing regularly.  You will have both fuel economy and towing capacity.

1012117,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-27 14:49:00,8243,There is nothing that trumps horsepower for towing. What you save on fuel over the years you will spend on maintenance on all mechanical components because of the strain on a smaller power plant.

1012120,Dutch01,2017-08-27 15:34:00,1431,"A little perspective. I have a 2015 Silverado 1500 4x4 with the 5.3L (355hp, 385 pounds of torque).  Because I have 3.08 gears, it's only rated to pull 6200 pounds (which is fine for me I'll never tow that much).  BUT  Some say it's best to stay under 80% of max tow for the longevity of the vehicle. 80% of 6200 is 4960. So if I were towing across Canada I could do it with my truck, but I'd think twice. Anything less than that and you're asking for expensive repairs and/or a vehicle with a shortened lifespan.  Just my opinion so take it with a grain of salt.   Edited to add: I couldn't afford the gas to tow 5500# across Canada either. Go diesel."
