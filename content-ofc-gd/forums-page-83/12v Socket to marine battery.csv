1012869,Governator,2017-09-07 02:48:00,879,I use a trolling motor on my SportsPal canoe and I'd like to have a removable 12v socket for it. I go island camping a couple times a year and it'd be nice to blow up an air mattress with the battery or charge a phone.  I know I can buy the minnkota battery box but figure I can save some $ and do a DIY project.  Anyone done that? Things to know?
1012871,Sinker,2017-09-07 04:10:00,8692,You can buy one that clips on the battery with alligator clips.

1012877,Governator,2017-09-07 10:58:00,879,Just found $6 at CT lol.  Cheers
