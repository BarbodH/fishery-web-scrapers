1012627,JoePa,2017-09-03 16:29:00,179,I'm thinking of getting a drone - mostly to look at things around the area where I live - since I live in the country I won't be bothering any neighbors - it would allow me to look over my property and adjoining land - the question I have - can I fly it in Canada and take pictures when I'm fishing up there - anyone have any thoughts - thanks - Joe

Drones allow one person to project their presence onto an entire landscape, decreasing the enjoyment of the other folks that have made an effort to get there. I am sure that most operators are well-intentioned, but that doesn't change the ever-increasing presence of these mechanical insects."
1012668,leaf4,2017-09-04 15:13:00,2466,"Ha.  If you can enjoy the outdoors the way you want to, why should someone else not be able to enjoy it the way they want to?"

1012702,manitoubass2,2017-09-04 21:42:00,11391,"Hahaha about 6 weeks ago someone was filming me fish. Was kinda funny for a minute but for an hour it was quite the annoyance  No idea who was filming my either???? I could see the operator.  I'd love one though, and I love seeing the footage.  I think used for documenting personal things etc it would be a blast!  I'd fly one here no prob!"
1012707,Terry,2017-09-04 22:00:00,14456,most small drones only have just over 15 minutes battery life I think it must be the .CIA must be watching you
1012712,manitoubass2,2017-09-04 22:29:00,11391,Lol. I see border patrol drones frequently but I doubt the CIA is watching some cripple fish lol
