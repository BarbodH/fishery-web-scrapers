Ill be doing night fishing mostly while the other half is asleep! lol Im Mostly familiar with rice lake but I cant find anything available for us to book!  Any help will be appreciated!"
1012022,jimmer,2017-08-24 18:03:00,2730,I have tried Stoney in the fall and found it to be a tough lake.  I feel the population on Little Bald is pounded during the winter and spring. My bet would be on the Otonabee.  Just my thoughts though.
1012045,DJGeneral,2017-08-25 15:22:00,163,"Thanks a lot man, I really appreciate it!"
1012060,KawarthaAngler,2017-08-25 18:49:00,273,All of those lakes should be OK if you find the right spots.  That's the hard part.  I can go out fishing for Crappie and get nothing but a friend of mine who is a big Crappie fisherman can go out the same day and come back with a nice haul.
1012061,jimmer,2017-08-25 19:06:00,2730,That's very true AdamW.
1012246,206,2017-08-29 13:05:00,563,I only find them in spring...they are easy picking when they come in to spawn  I gather they come shallow to feed in fall at dusk?
1012263,DJGeneral,2017-08-29 15:48:00,163,Thanks guys ill see what happens and ill let you guys know what happens and yes 206 fall time they come shallow to feed I have a lot of success on rice I fish all night there in the fall  up until the closing day in November when ever I get a ride that is took an uber lastweek 160$ was the damage Think I might put up a post requesting a fishing buddy that drives!
1012272,206,2017-08-29 18:06:00,563,Thanks guys ill see what happens and ill let you guys know what happens and yes 206 fall time they come shallow to feed I have a lot of success at the bewdley government dock on rice I fish all night there in the fall  up until the closing day in November when ever I get a ride that is took an uber lastweek 160$ was the damage Think I might put up a post requesting a fishing buddy that drives! They bite on soft plastics or do you use minnows?
1012278,DJGeneral,2017-08-29 19:02:00,163,If the bite is good I usually just use a minnow on a coloured hooked preferably green or if the bite is tough I use a northland gypsi jig tipped with a minnow! even get  walleye to hit this set up last year we had two nice eyes a day before the season had closed
1012279,DJGeneral,2017-08-29 19:08:00,163,too bad you're not in Toronto we could have gone out one night! ill let you know when im coming up when I do get a ride! lol and we could probably meet up

Welcome to the board DJ. Good luck on your search. I would suggest not mentioning exact locations, or you will find , you will not have a spot to fish, as it will be taken over by lurkers, or those wishing to not find their own spots, but yours.  I prefer late fall crappie and first ice crappie myself.  All on small micro jigs tipped with a maggot or mousie. I also use the throat of my catch. Thin slices of the silver outer flesh."

1012390,bellyup,2017-08-31 07:16:00,2,Thanks misfish.  Stoney lake has a popular boat rental spot close to good smallmouth fishing and at this time of the year could be the most fun type of fishing
