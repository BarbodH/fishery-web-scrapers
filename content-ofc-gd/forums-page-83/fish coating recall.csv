1012585,kickingfrog,2017-09-02 20:21:00,8333,"I don't use it but thanks for the heads up!   Got freaked out for a second but nope, I bought fish crisp.  Same here. I hadn't heard of it before either but figured that this might be a place that someone would have."
1012586,manitoubass2,2017-09-02 20:48:00,11391,I've used it but years ago. Def. Found better coatings.  Thanks for the heads up though! Im sure numerous anglers on this board still use that product
1012587,kickingfrog,2017-09-02 21:31:00,8333,"I like the store bought coatings, but prefer: crushed cornflakes, panko, regular bread crumbs  or Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I use the same for grouse as well."
1012592,woodenboater,2017-09-02 22:13:00,2277,"never understood buying coating when cornmeal, flour and some s&p is all you need  Quetico pickerel tasted good in that, mmm."
1012597,manitoubass2,2017-09-02 22:55:00,11391,"Nothing wrong with that at all. Heck just flour/seasoning salt is great!  But I rotate because there are ALOT of ways to enjoy fish  Sa.e reason I'll cook/season eggs about 20 different ways, and enjoy them all!"
