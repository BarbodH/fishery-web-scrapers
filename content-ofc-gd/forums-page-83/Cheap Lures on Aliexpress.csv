1011750,Cjones19,2017-08-20 20:32:00,4,"Has anyone actually tried buying lures off of the website ""Aliexpress.com""? I have bought other items from them and know that they are legit, but i am too scared to purchase their fishing items, it just seems too good to be true.  https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170820123114&isPremium=y&SearchText=fishing+lures  If anyone has bought anything from them please let me know how the product was!"
1011752,aplumma,2017-08-20 22:13:00,6896,I bought a diawa tatium reel making sure it was a current version and it was correct and new in box saving $40.00 US. i also bought a few lures and hooks but found them to be poorly made and the hooks cheap. If it is a brand name product your o.k. The penalty for making a mistake and trying to return it is a pain in the butt for sure.   Art
1011755,Fishwilly,2017-08-20 22:51:00,206,I've bought bearing snap swivels and they were a bargain. Caught numerous salmon and they're flawless.
1011823,jimmer,2017-08-21 20:18:00,2730,I just checked it out and will probably place an order at some point to see what they are like.

1011904,popofish!,2017-08-23 00:49:00,41,"Aliexpress is great, you just have to know what to buy. Spinners are good just make sure they are the Vibrax knock offs and that the weight and size is right. I've bought plenty of stuff from there. Be prepared to wait 2-3 months for delivery though."
1011923,AKRISONER,2017-08-23 12:23:00,5558,"a close friend bought some crank baits and top waters from them, they looked pretty good but the quality was absolute garbage."
1011931,GBW,2017-08-23 13:55:00,8460,PM me Cjones19 if you want bulk items as I can get them at possibly a better rate
1011948,canoecarrier,2017-08-23 16:03:00,54,"If you look on the reviews for the site, almost all of them say you will get scammed. Probably not a good sign, it is tempting though, very cheap for sure. Some of the reviews even said they went as far as stealing personal information, many have lost money off that site, check out the reviews before you decide to buy anything on there."

I bought the fake vibrax to compare them to the real ones.  I didn't even bother testing them and just gave them away.  It wasn't worth it for me when I can find them on sale for $4.  As for the mepps inline spinners, they sells fakes of them too.  Watch out for a guy on kijiji out of mississauga who sells mepps spinners.  They're the mepps knock offs.  A lot of guys I've seen try to pass these spinners off as authentic.  Also they buy a lot of other crap and try to sell them as their own product.  I like buying my terminal tackle off kijiji.  Cheap tungsten bass bullet weights, circle hooks, swivels, 3 way swivels, carp terminal tackle, beads for steelhead, acrylic and heavy beads of all sizes are bought off aliexpress and all repackaged as their own brand of beads.

1011992,206,2017-08-24 01:27:00,563,I have bought a few things..just beware most stuff is knock off  I bought 2 lews reels BNIB and they sent 2 different boxes with knock off reels. When i complained they gave me 1/2 my money back and the knock off reels dont work too bad.  I also bought 3 kast king reels on there to try out for worst and giggles. So far so good for a chap reel.

1012248,206,2017-08-29 13:09:00,563,"3 reels were under 120 to the door, 2 Sharky and a Mela. For the price its hard to be disappointed. Seem to work well under normal use so far, but i dont tend to catch alot lol"
1012257,outllaw,2017-08-29 15:17:00,1232,odds are you will get burned on quality. any metal products have lousy tensile strength including hooks etc. .we have dealt with china for years. unless you truly know your supplier its definatly buyer beware.
