1012200,Fish frames,2017-08-28 21:34:00,36,"I was able to get a bucket list fish thanks to an amazing guide out of Montreal. We met him at 6pm and we were out in a flash. It was pretty amazing to fish the St Lawrence - a river we all learned of its significance in our history books. Also incredible how our guide stumbled onto the fishery and location. A true angler who puts the time in, on a very calm Saturday night, not a soul around and these beastly fish were jumping all around us, unreal.  Hope you enjoy the video.  "
1012201,misfish,2017-08-28 21:58:00,29133,"Is there a season for these on the Larry? Only ask, as all I have ever heard is they are closed to angling here and there. There being everywhere.  The Queens fish  LOL"
1012202,captpierre,2017-08-28 22:04:00,2521,Wow. Thought the Fraser River was the only place to go.

1012209,manitoubass2,2017-08-28 22:38:00,11391,We have em in zone 5 too but no targetting
1012211,misfish,2017-08-28 22:50:00,29133,We have em in zone 5 too but no targetting   Seems legal where they are. Thats cool. I was just asking a question.
1012213,manitoubass2,2017-08-28 22:58:00,11391,"No worries mang, wish it was legal here too. Super fun to catch one or two, then it kinda becomes a nuisance lol  I spose if you set up to Target them it would be one heck of a day!  Sturgeon populations here are INSANE"
1012242,Rod Caster,2017-08-29 12:54:00,5784,"Is that your guide holding the fish in the leading picture? I went to college with that guy... always figured he'd be a fishing guide or something, definitely a true, caring angler."
1012244,Fish frames,2017-08-29 13:00:00,36,"He's my cousin, and he's one of the best guys I know. He should be out there guiding, somewhere. It was pretty funny, our guide was great, chatting, just good company and very knowledgable. We were picking his brain, and when he realized my cousin was outfishing him, guide quieted down into heavy concentration, lol.  He proceeded to school us, but cousin gave him a good run for his money. What a fun Saturday night!"
1012295,lickmyarmpit,2017-08-29 20:52:00,359,Awesome man I can target them in my area zone 8. I've tried once with a 1/4 oz. sliding sinker circle hook and cut herring with no luck.  What baits and what kind of water were you guys fishing?
1012299,Walleye'm Fishing,2017-08-29 21:11:00,310,Great stuff right there!
1012302,manitoubass2,2017-08-29 21:41:00,11391,Just walleye fish. They hang in the same area and bottom feed

1012308,Fish frames,2017-08-29 22:04:00,36,"They were what the guide called in a wintering area. Slight current on the edge of a 50 ft hole, fishing in 30 Fow.  He had a cool rig on a hook. 2 worms threaded, looked like an octopus(fourtopus?) lol."
1012311,Fish frames,2017-08-29 22:06:00,36," Funny you say that, we hooked into an eye there.   We also hooked into a bunch of 8-9lb channel cats too."
1012328,manitoubass2,2017-08-29 23:20:00,11391,All my incidentals have came walleye fishing
