1011963,AKRISONER,2017-08-23 20:26:00,5558,"a little personal story about grandkids...  I caught a severe bout of food poisoning earlier this year and was on day 2 of 3 of literally living a life of upchucking and passing out just barely managing to stay hydrated. I was staying at my parents house and my mom came to check up on me and i asked for her to possibly bring me some plain crackers to try get some food back into my system. She brought me some old-garbage stale crackers and said ""thats all ive got sorry"" i eat them reluctantly...a day later i emerge from my room mustering the strength to make it to the kitchen i look for more crackers and what do i see but a brand new box of cheese nips...i ask my mom what the hell is this? i thought you said we had no crackers?! you made me eat those disgusting ones! her reply ""those are for the grandkids"""

1011972,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-23 22:07:00,8243,Yep. All my parents Grandchildren are spending my inheritance. However I'd rather they see someone enjoy it while they are still alive.
