1012570,kickingfrog,2017-09-02 15:03:00,8333,So in my search for an alternative to crap-bucket for photo hosting I went through some photos I had on flickr. These would be from a trip to Mexico in February of 2005.         These are likely film photos from a disposable waterproof camera that where put on a cd.
1012576,manitoubass2,2017-09-02 16:49:00,11391,Awesome! What is that fish you have gaffed?  Thanks for sharing Rob!  I need to ocean fish at least once in this lifetime
1012584,kickingfrog,2017-09-02 20:18:00,8333,The little one was a barracuda and the bigger one on the gaff was a wahoo I believe.

1012626,ch312,2017-09-03 16:13:00,1590,"Wahoo, what a great tasting mild fish. We have a cheap ($2/lb) source for battered/frozen Wahoo and the stuff is delicious."
1012642,Rizzo,2017-09-03 22:17:00,4754,"I see baby barracuda, wahoo (although I first thought it was a kingfish), and then a ballyhoo (they make fine bait)"
1012659,Moosebunk,2017-09-04 03:25:00,3970,"Is Flickr cumbersome and slow Rob, or do you find it quick and easy to upload many images at once like PB?"
1012669,kickingfrog,2017-09-04 15:23:00,8333,I've only just starting using it again and haven't uploaded many photos. Once hunting season starts hopefully I'll have some batches to load and share.
