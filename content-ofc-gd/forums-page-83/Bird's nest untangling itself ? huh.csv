Ended up with an ugly bird's nest, which I couldn't be bothered picking apart since I had another rod with me. Someone else then needed a rod so I lent them the spinning and went back to the nest. It would only cast short distances but somehow, the nest untangled itself after a few casts and all was good. Saved me a job.  Has this ever happened to anyone else or were the fishing gods taking pity on me ?  re:fishing - the Cranking Rap enticed a pike but it shook the hook (only barbless allowed in Quetico). Got a smallie as well but it was its namesake...small"

1012223,Rizzo,2017-08-29 02:09:00,4754,"cant say I have ever casted thru a birds nest but it would make sense. Every once in a while you get one where no picking is required, just keep pulling hard on line. Now this video is something else. That I will have to try some time....almost excited for a backlash to happen"
1012224,manitoubass2,2017-08-29 02:13:00,11391,"I seen a different vid, similar though, years ago. Works like a charm but it won't work everytime"
1012245,Lape0019,2017-08-29 13:01:00,647,I can see it happening but I've always picked them out as soon as they happen. Some are just a pull on the line until it looks good on the spool which would probably come out with a few casts though.
1012253,woodenboater,2017-08-29 14:13:00,2277,"yeah, I pulled on the line a few times but figured I better not make it tighter. Perhaps flinging the Rapala had enough torque to clear it, dunno But def gonna try to remember that thumb trick !  btw, was a Power Pro nest"
1012273,SirCranksalot,2017-08-29 18:19:00,3291,Looks like Murphy finally took a day off----after all those years of not missing a day!!
1012286,Weeds,2017-08-29 20:07:00,782,Nice. Splurged on a 300 yard spool of 80 pound braid to start musky season this year on my c3 6501 and managed a loop/snare on the first day of season so deep I can't  make more than a 30ish yard cast yet can't for the life of me get the snag put of the line. Might have to cut the entire spool away for all I know. Enough to drive a man mad.

1012294,boombap,2017-08-29 20:45:00,310,This will not work on braid
1012301,Pikeslayer,2017-08-29 21:35:00,1443,IT DOES WORK ON BRAID!!  So there  LOL
1012303,misfish,2017-08-29 21:42:00,29133,"IT DOES WORK ON BRAID!!  So there LOL   I,ll let you know Simon, the next time I get one."

1012314,Pikeslayer,2017-08-29 22:12:00,1443,Haha....
1012315,Rizzo,2017-08-29 22:13:00,4754,doesn't work on braid...forget it...I will just troll then!
