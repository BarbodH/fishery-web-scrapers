Wondering for next year we're probably going to want to head up to the same area, but more likely for a week, are there any private campgrounds that cater to trailering up that way?  Thanks in advance for any direction ?"
1012807,SirCranksalot,2017-09-06 13:54:00,3291,I think Killarney does in fact have elec sites
1012812,leaf4,2017-09-06 14:44:00,2466,Only the yurts from what their site shows
1012823,Headhunter,2017-09-06 15:52:00,5703,"I would suggest that you call J&G Marina in Espanola. They service McGregor Bay, which is just north of Killarney. we used them this summer and they were great! Give'm a shout and ask them about camping spots in the area, they will know. The fishing opportunities in McGregor Bay far exceed what's available in the Killarney area as the bay is stuffed with islands and shoals, where the Killarney area has less fishable areas. Also, McGregor Bay can be fished regardless of wind as there are so many islands you hide out and out of the wind. HH"
1012836,Acountdeleted,2017-09-06 20:22:00,2562,I think Restoule does? Possibly Black Sturgeon as well.
1012837,woodenboater,2017-09-06 20:32:00,2277,I believe Sturgeon Bay PP (north of Parry Sound) has electric sites. Been a few years.
1012857,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-07 00:01:00,8243,Nothing to add other than have a great trip.
1012861,OhioFisherman,2017-09-07 00:43:00,6623,I believe Sturgeon Bay PP (north of Parry Sound) has electric sites. Been a few years.  http://www.ontarioparks.com/park/sturgeonbay/camping  According to this they have electric sites.
1012873,leaf4,2017-09-07 10:34:00,2466,Thanks hopefully the weather cooperates!
1012874,leaf4,2017-09-07 10:35:00,2466,Thanks I'll look into it for sure
1012878,woodenboater,2017-09-07 11:36:00,2277,"Thanks I'll look into it for sure   iirc, they also had docks, so you're a short hop into the Bay"
