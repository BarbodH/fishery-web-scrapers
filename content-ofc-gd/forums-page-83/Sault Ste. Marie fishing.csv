Marie the first week of October to target trout and salmon.. Its going to be a 9 hour drive me so I was hoping someone could help point me in the right direction and possibly give me a couple tips on the area and where to fish. I'll be float fishing and tossing spoons and help is appreciated... thanks ?

Edit: yes he still is guiding http://www.tylerdunnguiding.ca/"
1012767,Huntress87,2017-09-05 21:08:00,4,Awesome thank you for the contact tip
1012834,maker a laker,2017-09-06 20:14:00,33,"Check your regulations and open seasons. Speckles in the rivers usually close labour day weekend or Sept 15th latest. October may also be too late for salmon run. A buddy has done the trip twice, with success in mid August. Atlantics in the St Marys River were his interest, but also went north to Agawa, Sand & Montreal rivers.  He spoke with the fly fishing/tackle shop guy right in SSMarie for advice."
1012849,huzzsaba,2017-09-06 21:55:00,884,Anyone know when when the pink salmon run happens up in sault ste Marie?  I heard it happens every 2 years.
1012859,Huntress87,2017-09-07 00:31:00,4,"Thank you for the info  ....I'm most likely going to head up in September so I can still catch the pink and Atlantic salmon, I might be alittle late but it's worth a shot... thanks again for the great tips  "
1012882,J Roelofsen,2017-09-07 14:18:00,84,Happens every year;) They should be kicking around in the Soo rapids already and they usually show in numbers somewhere between Sept 10-20th on the nearby tribs.
1012883,Dara,2017-09-07 14:30:00,3052,Salmon and rainbows in the rapids downtown. Warm waders and felt soles are a must. Not much in the way of float fishing there unless you want to end up in lake Huron. Every gate is open. You almost need earplugs to dim the roar. There is rainbow fishing in the rivers up north of the Sault but read the regs as some rivers can be closed. Again its wader country. Talk to Orst at the trading post on 17 North. he will sell you stuff and point you in the right direction
