I do my own firewood, but this year there was a problem with my usual source, and I have kind of been left high and dry. I have a few cords ready to go, but I am going to need a lot more sooner than later.    I have called a ton of kijiji yahoos as well. Hard to find someone to deliver a load of logs.   S."

I don't know anything about the operation and there's no phone number posted anywhere or even a name but maybe if you search the web you can find something. It's only a few miles from me and I was by there today but didn't see anyone around and can't offer you anymore than that.  "

They do mention on their home page that they might be able to link people up with tandem loads if you call them. I used to buy lengths from a company called Merrill Barry in West Guilford, but he isn't listing wood on his webpage anymore.  He might know someone though. That's all I've got Sinker"

Most already have a source that buys the wood or they stockpile it and split firewood during slow times to sell themselves. Personally, I just hit Kijiji for firewood as it's free and already cut into manageable sizes.   I've used my new Fiskars 8lb splitting maul a couple times now and it makes life so much easier.

One of the Amish sawmills near me used wood that wasn't high quality to make wood pallets, another place near me ground up wood pallets to make mulch, they even dyed some of it. Some of those sawmills had mountains of sawdust, now it gets loaded into big dumpsters and is used to make wood pellets for pellet stoves? Some now do the same with their slab wood.  http://www.woodpellets.com/heating-fuels/pellet-processing.aspx"

I got 4 good loads of ash out of confederation park in Hamilton when they were cutting there in the spring. I don't know of anyone who would sell logs around here but that would be a good idea for the years where I couldn't scrounge enough.. Splitting it is a different thing,  I usually rent a splitter once a year but I'd love to find a good used one.."

Many years ago we used to get a permit ($) to harvest trees that we not good for lumber but had to be cut. Near Bancroft I believe. Huge pile of logs we cut them to fit a truck and loaded it up. Have to be careful they are not neatly stacked and one of our boys had an accident. .

1012350,crappieperchhunter,2017-08-30 13:53:00,2582,$410 for the  bush cord I bought last fall here in Oshawa. I get almost 2 full seasons out of a bush cord. Weekends in the fall winter and early spring you will generally find Debbe down in the family room chilling in front of our woodstove.  Best money I spend.
1012351,Raf,2017-08-30 14:23:00,3495,I think I paid $320 for a bush cord delivered last year in dufferin county.  Which reminds me...

1012357,jimmer,2017-08-30 15:56:00,2730,"I paid $300 a bush cord this year and go through 3 a year. You might be talking about a face cord Old Ironmaker. It is definitely getting harder to find a good source.  They like to short change you through the length of the wood or including crappy wood in the mix, that happened to me last year buying off Kijiji.  I think if you find a good place it will be $350 a bush cord, but better than being short changed."
1012359,lew,2017-08-30 16:02:00,12766,Wish I'd known you needed wood a couple months ago Shane as I just got rid of my airtight wood stove down in the family room and replaced it with a propane.  I sold 1 1/2 bush cords of split & dried hardwood for $200
1012394,Sinker,2017-08-31 13:44:00,8692,"Bummer!!!  Finding wood is easy, finding good wood, not so easy.  Old....if you are getting bush cords for $60, and its good hardwood, I'm already on my way. A lot of people call a face cord a cord....which its not. I know down in your neck of the woods, there is a lot of dead ash, thats infected with the Ash Borer Bettle....I'd rather not bring that up here. Its here now, but no need to make it worse.  Finding a truck load of logs is not as easy as it usually is this year. Not sure what the deal is. Maybe too wet?? I dunno, but I need wood asap. I hate paying top dollar for it though....anyone have some trees they need cut down? I'm pretty handy with a chainsaw.  S."
1012397,GBW,2017-08-31 14:24:00,8460,anyone have some trees they need cut down? I'm pretty handy with a chainsaw.  S. To bad my father signed a deal with a guy to bring a big maple down in Oct in his yard... However the guy 2 doors over sells wood but not sure his rates.  PM for name if you are willing to go to Burnt River for it.
1012398,OhioFisherman,2017-08-31 14:24:00,6623,"That Ash Borer will probably be a problem anywhere there are ash trees, it is sure a problem here in Ohio, you can look at a tree line and spot the Ash trees, they are the ones dead or dying, they have restrictions here on transporting Ash, some counties don't allow it."
1012399,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-31 14:26:00,8243,"No it's not a bush cord, sorry. It's all slab hardwood though from a local mill. it's packed tight so more than a face cord but no bush cord."

The last couple of winters here have been very mild, the Amish sawmills in the area are having a glut of slabwood, I got 6 cords delivered a couple of months ago for 425 bucks an early season sale! Never saw it advertised like that before."
1012403,crappieperchhunter,2017-08-31 14:38:00,2582,"what crappieperchhunter said, 4x4x8  or... 3 face cords (or just cords) = 1 bush cord  You gotta be careful with what some call a face cord. Some wood is all cut 14 inches so your getting screwed out of a lot of wood if you assume 3 of those face cords would equal a bush cord. I get all my wood cut at 12 inches so 4 face cords would be a bush cord...which is why my wood costs more as well...because it's more cutting/work for my supplier. I pay it because our wood stove is smaller and if I get anything much over 17 it becomes a PITA to fit in and because 12 inch cuts are much easier for Debbe to handle/split when I'm not home."
1012471,Woodsman,2017-09-01 01:35:00,1286,Legally in Ontario there is only one definition of a cord. 4' X 4' X 8'. Legally no such thing as a bush or face cord.
1012473,dintymoore,2017-09-01 02:45:00,62,I know a guy. Call 705-657-2300 during the day. Ask for Rod.

1012481,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-09-01 11:16:00,535,"Be very wary of buying wood from someone you don't know. Get references if possible. Maybe buy 1 cord at first, pile it to make sure it's a full bush cord then buy more.  I cut all of my own wood so I know what I'm getting. My stove is small so I usually cut 12-14"" long. One option is buying logs and cutting and splitting them yourself. They will need time to season though but you'll save a ton of money that way.  Make sure it's not only the right amount but also good hardwood and properly seasoned. The wood should be turning grey on the outside. If it seems like it's too good to be true, it is."
1012506,OhioFisherman,2017-09-01 15:23:00,6623,I don't think you could squeeze a cord of wood into a pickup truck without some pretty high ad on sides on it.
1012508,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2017-09-01 15:34:00,535,You can't. I've got a 6' box and I might be able to squeeze a face cord into it if I pack it to the max. If they're just delivering it with just a regular pickup even with an 8' box and calling it a bush cord I'd be telling them to turn right back around.
