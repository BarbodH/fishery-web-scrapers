Looking for Walleye and Smallmouths an hour or so north of the Buckhorn\Peterborough  area. Any suggestions for a good lake in the area?  Appreciate any suggestions.  Thanks "
1012147,ecmilley,2017-08-28 02:17:00,2163,I would  have recommended rice but since u wanna go north boskung soyers jack cedar anstruther take your pick
1012157,GBW,2017-08-28 14:23:00,8460,Sturgeon lake is also an option if you have a good sonar/gps
1012158,AKRISONER,2017-08-28 14:55:00,5558,id fish pigeon or stoney to be honest lol
1012163,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-28 15:44:00,8243,"If I was where you are Stoney Lake for sure, take a shot at Burleigh Falls where Stoney starts too. Launch at Burleigh."
1012164,Terry,2017-08-28 15:45:00,14456,Yeah I would have said the kawarthas but you said north.
1012165,KawarthaAngler,2017-08-28 15:57:00,273,This is the perfect thread for me as I was going to post the same question as the OP !!  I'm on Upper Buckhorn as well and my father wants to do some walleye fishing.  He was hoping to find a lake an hour or so north of Peterborough/Buckhorn that may give us some fun results for a day trip.  We have found the Tri-Lakes/Lower Buckhorn area to simply have too much pressure and lousy walleye results. We went to Selerno Lake (south west corner of Haliburton Highlands) on the weekend but got skunk'd.  Hoping we may get a couple good suggestions of a lake that has a fairly good boat launch.  Thanks!
1012167,jimmer,2017-08-28 16:10:00,2730,The problem is that most won't share one of those fragile smaller lakes that are in the Haliburtons.  The best bet is to identify which lakes have walleye and then go and explore.  You might have to go a little further than an hour from Peterborough.

We tried Selerno because his neighbor spoke highly of it.  We may have simply had a bad day.  We were fishing drop-offs along shortlines where the weeds ended it went quickly to approx 20ft.  Not a single bite, not even bass.  Then we worked around some rock shoals that where just sticking out of the water and had transitions to weeds and drop-offs ... again nothing.  We finished off at one small section that had some shallow lilly pads and I have one large mouth smack my surface frog ... approx 2lb'r ... saw it swim away."
1012177,AKRISONER,2017-08-28 18:07:00,5558,hmmm  fishing walleyes during the day in the dead of summer is always gonna be a tougher bite.  but my accidental catches of walleye on those lakes tells me that its a pretty decent fishery.
1012185,Sinker,2017-08-28 19:57:00,8692,"Oddly enough, I was going to suggest selerno lake....  S."
1012187,Sinker,2017-08-28 20:00:00,8692,I wouldn't leave the kawarthas for walleyes within an hour of PTBO. There's tons here.  S.
1012188,KawarthaAngler,2017-08-28 20:02:00,273,"Oddly enough, I was going to suggest selerno lake....  S.  That's funny.  My fathers neighbor says he likes the lake.  Obviously then we did something wrong.  We weren't on the lake 5 minutes and asked a family sitting on a dock where they had 2 little kids fishing .... your typical nice young family scene on the dock ... and asked if they had any fishing suggestions since it was our first time on the lake and the guy said ""not much fish in this lake"".  LOL  I'm thinking we fished it like we fish the Trent Severn lakes which was a mistake.  That is too much focus in shallower water and crankbaits along the top or along the sides of the weedbeds."
1012190,Sinker,2017-08-28 20:15:00,8692,I have done well trolling worm harnesses off the weed edges/drop offs in there. Bottom bouncers in 15-20ft usually works now.  S.

1012367,jimmer,2017-08-30 20:12:00,2730,^ good advice
1012395,Sinker,2017-08-31 13:45:00,8692,This is an excellent tip. I wasn't going to say anything....LOL
