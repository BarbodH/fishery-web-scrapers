1012285,Toronto_Angler,2017-08-29 19:54:00,698,One corporate name changed to another corporate name. I'm sure someone will be outraged though lol
1012287,misfish,2017-08-29 20:15:00,29133,Was this not the name of the Ottawa rink at one time?
1012292,DRIFTER_016,2017-08-29 20:35:00,10439,Was this not the name of the Ottawa rink at one time?  Where?
1012296,misfish,2017-08-29 21:00:00,29133, Where?   I thought it was once named the Scotia bank center.
1012298,Walleye'm Fishing,2017-08-29 21:10:00,310,It was called Scotia Bank Place in Ottawa.
1012300,misfish,2017-08-29 21:26:00,29133,"It was called Scotia Bank Place in Ottawa.   Thank you, we are doomed.   LOL"
1012305,muskymatt,2017-08-29 21:45:00,2608,"  Thank you, we are doomed.   LOL As opposed to all the winning your team has done since 1967??  Bahahhahaha......the laffs suck so bad they gotta change the name of the rink.  too funny!!!"
1012306,misfish,2017-08-29 21:53:00,29133,"As opposed to all the winning your team has done since 1967??  Bahahhahaha......the laffs suck so bad they gotta change the name of the rink.  too funny!!!   I like you Matt, Yer funny.  Maybe they ( the bank ) figured they needed a new generation team to make them a winning sponsor. We will need to though, wipe the stench/ infection of your rink, with many bottle of javx.  LOL"
1012312,grimsbylander,2017-08-29 22:07:00,3016,"As opposed to all the winning your team has done since 1967??  Bahahhahaha......the laffs suck so bad they gotta change the name of the rink.  too funny!!!  Curious, do you use the shortcuts CTRL C and CTRL V for all your responses? This could save you an absolute ton of time."

1012324,BassMan11,2017-08-29 23:06:00,583,The Sens have had 4 arena name changes since 1996. I really don't care since they are an irrelevant franchise in the NHL.... But I just thought i'd point this out.  Don't like the name change myself but money talks obviously. I am sure by the end of this 20 year contract Ottawa won't even be in the league.  GLG
1012326,Terry,2017-08-29 23:12:00,14456,"someones team must be pretty bad, if the only good thing you can say for your team is negative comments about other teams  so so sad"
1012329,dave524,2017-08-29 23:21:00,4508,"It was called Scotia Bank Place in Ottawa.  It was also the Paladium  and the Corel Centre , but then I'm old"
1012330,misfish,2017-08-29 23:27:00,29133," It was also the Paladium  and the Corel Centre , but then I'm old   I remember the Kanada sp, was the first, NO ?  KANADA DO ANYTHING RIGHT."
1012332,leaf4,2017-08-29 23:46:00,2466,Yuck! ACC has a nice ring to it... Scotia Bank arena not so much!

1012341,Acountdeleted,2017-08-30 03:05:00,2562,Sooooo boring. If they really wanted to get their name across they'd call it 'Scotia bank presents the (insert catchy name). But no. It has to be the Scotia Bank place.  Just like how I wish it was 'Rogers presents the Sky Dome'
1012348,muskymatt,2017-08-30 13:35:00,2608,Aaaah---let MM have his fun!! The Leafs deserve all the abuse they get!! They certainly do lol
1012349,muskymatt,2017-08-30 13:37:00,2608,"Sooooo boring. If they really wanted to get their name across they'd call it 'Scotia bank presents the (insert catchy name). But no.

Just like how I wish it was 'Rogers presents the Sky Dome' Scotia Bank presents the ""team that has done nothing in 50 years and is the laughing stock of the NHL"". Yeah, that has a nice ring to it"
1012356,DRIFTER_016,2017-08-30 15:51:00,10439,"Scotia Bank presents the ""team that has done nothing in 50 years and is the laughing stock of the NHL"". Yeah, that has a nice ring to it  OMG!!! Is Scotiabank sponsoring the Sens barn too?"
1012360,jimmer,2017-08-30 16:02:00,2730,"It should be called Scotiabank's Customer Arena, since the funds are coming out of the pockets of all the people who bank with them. $800,000,000?  MLSE is doing something right! Maybe it's a good move now that they will be one of the better teams in the league."
1012365,John Bacon,2017-08-30 20:07:00,3277, OMG!!! Is Scotiabank sponsoring the Sens barn too?  They did in the past.  Now they have found another NHL team with whom they would rather be associated.
1012372,Acountdeleted,2017-08-30 21:51:00,2562,Looks like they finally want to back a winner.
