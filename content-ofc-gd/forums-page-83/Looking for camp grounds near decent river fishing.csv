1012690,Ssancients,2017-09-04 20:52:00,1,My buddy's and I are hoping to get a trip in towards the end of september/ start of October. We live in Port Dover and don't want to drive more than an hour or 2. Lastly we'd like the option to fish in a spot that's secluded so we don't get in trouble if we're drinking.
