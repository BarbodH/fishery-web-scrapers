1009441,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-19 18:44:00,937,I'm in the market for a tackle bag for bass.  I'm leaning toward the smaller version of the Plano A Series  Last week it went on sale for $39.99  What are you guys using?  EDIT:  I'm a shore angler and wanna keep it light      https://www.sail.ca/en/plano-quick-top-bag-3600-302320  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2nncQzxHwY  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5dsRH7QBEg

1009445,grimsbylander,2017-07-19 19:36:00,3016,"I don't own a bag. Plano boxes go straight to the boat's compartments and back to the garage after each trip. On the rare occasion I need to transport them, they go in a duffle bag until I get to where I'm going. I find tackle bags are cumbersome and just another thing to dig through when I'm looking for something. JMHO"
1009447,GBW,2017-07-19 19:47:00,8460,I have a spiderwire bag from Ctire and it's perfect I got the same one last year when it went on sale at Can Tire as the base of my old one got a rip in the soft plastic bottom.  The tool holder on the front it handy as you can take it off and clip it to you so your pliers are always handy
1009448,GBW,2017-07-19 19:50:00,8460,Look like Plano has a guide series just like the Spiderwire one I have http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/plano-guide-series-bag-with-4-x-3650-stowaways-storage-boxes-0777567p.html#srp
1009450,Dan668,2017-07-19 19:52:00,1120,"I currently throw stuff all in a compartment but thinking about buying a big waterproof duffle that I can slide under the console. I store my boat outside, so after each trip, everything comes out."

I find tackle bags are cumbersome and just another thing to dig through when I'm looking for something. JMHO   I have a stack of plano boxes. When I know what I am going for, I just put them in a flip lid cooler. It holds 4 boxes, 2 batterys for the finder, 2 frozen bottles of water and lunch. Just grab my rods and cooler when I leave the crib. When I get to my local, I just pick the ones I want, put them in my toon pouch.  I still have my old Plano carrying bag. The only one I ever bought 20 YAG. I  use it for when I am walking to shore fishing areas.  I also use a back pack when fishing the tribs. Plano and go."
1009464,Andy,2017-07-19 22:57:00,330,I really like the Cabela's Advanced Anglers tackle bag in the large size for my bass and pike lures. And I'm not that advanced. Andy
1009480,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-20 03:48:00,937,"I have a spiderwire bag from Ctire and it's perfect  I'll have to check it out next time I go.  I remember it being a black bag with 4 storage boxes and always on sale.   http://www.basspro.com/shop/en/bass-pro-shops-xps-stalker-top-loader-tackle-bag-or-system   been loving this bag, the rain cover and especially the line spool pouches with dispensers are so key! pull a length of line for a leader and snip.  Looks nice but outta my price range.  Looking to spend no more then $50   I don't own a bag. Plano boxes go straight to the boat's compartments and back to the garage after each trip. On the rare occasion I need to transport them, they go in a duffle bag until I get to where I'm going. I find tackle bags are cumbersome and just another thing to dig through when I'm looking for something. JMHO  I shore fish and I try to go as light as I can.  I usually bring out one plano 3700 box each trip I go with what I want to use that day.  But some days I wish I could bring out more baits.  Sucks going fishing and you leave something behind that's working for everyone else.  Look like Plano has a guide series just like the Spiderwire one I have http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/plano-guide-series-bag-with-4-x-3650-stowaways-storage-boxes-0777567p.html#srp  That's not bad.  Do you know if they go on sale?"

1009490,GBW,2017-07-20 11:53:00,8460,That's not bad.  Do you know if they go on sale? Not to sure but I'd guess yeah.  I made a deal with the MGR here at my store on mine as someone took the trays so all I was getting was the bag.  I had a bunch of trays so not worried.  He tried to give me more trays and I said no it's fine so I got it for the sale price plus the 'cost' off for a pack of trays.
1009495,colin519,2017-07-20 12:21:00,101,I've had a KVD bag that was stolen.  Moved to a Plano Guide series I think. Anything with a solid plastic bottom is nice. Easy to clean up and stable.  I would consider a backpack if I were always fishing from shore.
1009646,msp,2017-07-21 16:51:00,1336,Currently I am  using a 16ft Sylvan sc. Or a hockey bag lol
1009647,DRIFTER_016,2017-07-21 17:31:00,10439,I don't bass fish but when I'm hitting the rivers for trouts and sammins I have a shoulder pack I wear. When in the drift boat I have a bag similar to this. http://www.cabelas.com/product/fishing/tackle-storage/tackle-bags%7C/pc/104793480/c/104777280/sc/104619780/cabelas-tackle-utility-bag-with-boxes/1651574.uts  Would probably do what you need.  Personally I would go with some kind of waist pack and travel very light or get one of the backpack tackle systems.
1009665,Andy,2017-07-22 09:17:00,330,I noticed last night that the Canadian Cabelas site has a backpack tackle bag on sale. That may suit your needs. Andy
1009684,OhioFisherman,2017-07-22 18:25:00,6623,"I used to wander around at night fishing some ponds and small lakes from shore, I used a back pack for that. Carrying a couple of rods and a flashlight to see my way around dangers left a shortage of hands to carry stuff."
1012049,PUMP KNOWS,2017-08-25 16:46:00,937,Finally pulled the trigger on a bag.  I'm gonna buy more stowaway storage containers for other species and will just mix and match when I head out.  
1012065,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-25 21:20:00,8243,I use a knapsack that was on sale at CTC years ago for 15 bucks. It has exterior and interior pockets and it holds 3 Plano boxes plus whatever I throw in the bottom of it. For whatever I am going for that's the boxes I put in it. I love the 2 straps it has as I can sling it over my shoulder and have 2 free hands for rods and my lunch bag/cooler. Can't beat it. Plus when it's MT it's a knapsack.
1012113,Duckie,2017-08-27 13:30:00,305,"I was using a bass pro bag that came with those clear tackle compartments, it was I think $80. after a year, the shoulder strap ripped off. disappointing.  I invested a little more money and bought a G. Loomis tackle bag. its amazing and much better quality. Feels like I'll have it for 20 years. I love it."
