I had planned to drift around casting crank baits, rather than battle the rice fields.  I caught a few, but they were smaller fish.  I could see the rice and it seemed to be calling me.  I caved and headed over to a patch that I had not fished much this year.  I had a frog and a fluke tied on. I wasn't getting any action on the frog, so stuck with the fluke.  I headed into the thickest stuff and everything went crazy. Had a hit almost every cast; they were chasing the fluke even as I was lifting it out of the water.  All  I would have to do is drop it back in and wham.  Even had a good size muskie chasing the thing around.  Lost count of the number of fish I caught, but it was one of those nights you get every once in awhile.  Nothing huge, but always fun when something is pulling.  Sorry no pictures."
