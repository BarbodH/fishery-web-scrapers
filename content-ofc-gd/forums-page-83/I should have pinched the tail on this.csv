1011906,chris.brock,2017-08-23 01:31:00,4053, Awesome muskie Bill! The French can be tough but it does cough up some beauties like that one.
1011939,msp,2017-08-23 14:28:00,1336,Tank ! nice one Bill !
1011961,Dusky,2017-08-23 19:59:00,310,Nice fish!! Glade you got a picture as well.
1011969,mike rousseau,2017-08-23 21:03:00,4661,Don't worry about pinching  If it made you happy that's all that really matters  Nice fish
1011975,Rizzo,2017-08-23 22:18:00,4754,Awesome! One heck of a fish. I have a buddy in Barrie who always casts a dang believer when we go out (for me I just use it trolling as well). So you are not the only one (even from Barrie!) who likes to cast em.
1011986,smithy97,2017-08-24 00:14:00,70,"Beauty fish! Musky fishing is my absolute favourite. Can't get enough. My PB is 41"" from Pigeon Lake. This is my first full season of fishing for them. After I get a bit more experienced I plan on getting to the Wolseley Bay area of the French to try and catch the fish of a lifetime. I know its tough going on the French so a huge congrats to you!"
1012027,blaque,2017-08-24 20:19:00,2419,Great fish man.........was up on the french before musky season for eyes'. Not many rumblings at camp about whats in the river for these beasts but nice to see an example
1012102,Gallie,2017-08-27 01:35:00,1215,Sweet ski bill!
1012110,Freshtrax,2017-08-27 06:41:00,2215,"Beauty fish  . Some monsters In that fishery  skis , pike, walleye and bass. Problem is it all looks fishey."
1012401,Brettiop,2017-08-31 14:33:00,279,"Nice Fish Bill!  The first big Ski is certainly a Rush, still searching for a real biggun myself."
1011708,BillM,2017-08-20 14:22:00,17367,"Parents were up at French River for a week or so with my niece and her cousin.  I decided to head up Thurs and spend a few days fishing.  Weather was crap, rain everyday but at least the temp was constant.   Heard rumours of some muskie being hooked and caught, brought my muskie stuff with me and thought I'd put some effort into them.  Second night, back bay about 15ft of water just off the edge of a nice weed edge, absolutely destroyed my jointed Believer as soon as it hit the water.   Fight was maybe 5mins, half of that was telling my oldman to put the net away    She got rolled up pretty good but none of the hooks were buried.  Quick measurement was 47in to the fork and very very girthy.  Bigger width wise then any pike I've caught.   Such a nice fish.  Of course didn't have a camera, lucky some people we knew were only about 50ft away and grabbed some pics for us.   She swam off great after about 5 mins.   I understand why people get hooked on these fish.  I'm 6'3 and as you can tell I'm not holding the fish 5ft from my body    She was a big big girl.   The HB 959 I picked up also works awesome with the Terrova!  Nice to have a big screen up there.  "
1011709,Raf,2017-08-20 14:32:00,3495,"Congrats.  Now it begins.  French river fish have ""shoulders""."
1011710,OhioFisherman,2017-08-20 14:39:00,6623,Nice fish!
1011717,misfish,2017-08-20 15:41:00,29133,"Nice fish bud, but yer still ugly.LOL"
1011719,Weeds,2017-08-20 16:09:00,782,"Nice! Always think of believers as being primarily trolling lures, although I know they work casting too."
1011720,Bass Tard,2017-08-20 16:37:00,128,"Good fish for sure!  I don't understand put the net away?!  We're going to be up in Alban in two weeks, a few of our boys looking to hook into their first muskies."
1011723,ketchenany,2017-08-20 16:41:00,3229,"Nice fish Bill,  Don't listen to Brian he is having widthdrawl pains didn't get out yesterday!"

1011728,BillM,2017-08-20 17:01:00,17367,"Good fish for sure!  I don't understand put the net away?!  We're going to be up in Alban in two weeks, a few of our boys looking to hook into their first muskies.  Didn't have my big salmon net with me."
1011731,BillM,2017-08-20 17:10:00,17367,"Nice! Always think of believers as being primarily trolling lures, although I know they work casting too.  With the double eyelets to change your depth, these are one of my fav casting baits.   Especially when you wanna swim it just above the weeds, makes for a great surface lure as well."
1011732,Joeytier,2017-08-20 17:20:00,3990,Never caught a musky before??  Great start if so!
1011743,captpierre,2017-08-20 19:05:00,2521,Well done. You know what I say.... A fish like that is better than sex. ?
1011746,manitoubass2,2017-08-20 19:19:00,11391,Wow! If ya woulda told me bill never caught a muskie I'd call ya full of it.That's one heck of a fish bill!Congrats!
1011747,farsider,2017-08-20 19:32:00,456,"Nicely done!  Thanks for sharing.  Cheers,  Mark"
1011754,Moosebunk,2017-08-20 22:50:00,3970,It really only takes people one muskie to start their madness.  Nice one Bill.
1011758,spincast,2017-08-21 00:01:00,3279,nice fish.
1011761,LeXXington,2017-08-21 01:22:00,1928,very nice !
1011763,BillM,2017-08-21 02:13:00,17367,"I've caught muskie, but nothing even close to this."
1011777,grimsbylander,2017-08-21 11:53:00,3016,That's a great fish Bill. Congrats on landing that beast! I still have a Strawberry coloured Believer hidden away somewhere!
1011780,AKRISONER,2017-08-21 12:58:00,5558,"unreal bill...im still waiting for my first chunky one from that neck of the woods.  Glad to see everything worked out with the unit as well! Im still actively shopping for an upgrade on the graph for the front of my boat as well!  The muskys have indeed been active, I caught one two weeks ago (not nearly this huge) and saw multiple surfacing this past weekend while trolling eyes...Pops also slapped a 40+ inch pike this past weekend. I think the mild summer has got the big fish frisky."
1011782,buick14,2017-08-21 13:04:00,741,That's a great fish congrats !!
1011785,Ralph Field,2017-08-21 13:47:00,1018,Congrats ! A fish of a life time.
1011792,Reef Runner,2017-08-21 15:08:00,980,Nice shootin'.  My PB is also 47 and it's been that way for years.  Keep at 'er.
1011848,Sinker,2017-08-22 14:07:00,8692,"Nice fish. Never measure to the fork!! Take the longest possible measurement. My biggest of the season is a 47.5"" from LOTW.  S."
1011880,BillM,2017-08-22 21:01:00,17367,"Nice fish. Never measure to the fork!! Take the longest possible measurement. My biggest of the season is a 47.5"" from LOTW.  S.  I was holding the fish, my oldman did the measuring, lol!  ah well I'll just have to catch something bigger next time"
