1012402,Old Ironmaker,2017-08-31 14:35:00,8243,No one is going to give you their hot spot on this or most any fishing forums. It's actually discouraged. Maybe someone will PM you. I would ask someone where you are staying.
1012416,jimmer,2017-08-31 16:18:00,2730,Let us know if you find a hotspot.  I fished out of there a couple of times over the years in the fall and never caught one walleye.  Ended up focusing on Perch so we could have a feed while we were there.

1012672,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-04 16:05:00,8243,I have gotten all my Pics on Stoney in waters 6 to 15 feet deep. So you should fish the water from 6 to 50 feet and you should be good to go.
