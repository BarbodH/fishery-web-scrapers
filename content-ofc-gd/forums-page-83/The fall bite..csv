1012409,OhioFisherman,2017-08-31 15:40:00,6623,"LOL, we always tried to time our September trips to PAB to hit right after the first real cold spell, it seemed to signal the fish to feed, it was almost always mid to late September. This time of year here we are usually still dealing with the dog days of August."
1012412,jimmer,2017-08-31 16:06:00,2730,What bite???? LOL Frost warning in the Kawarthas also.
1012414,fishindevil,2017-08-31 16:08:00,6254,"the fall bite for smallies has started already because of the cooler water temps and air temps in central Ontario.....I was fishing and it was 5 degrees last weekend in central Ontario with a few lakes in the 68 degree water temp and some as low as 64....the smallies are putting on the feed bag ,,,,,,,  :clapping:"
1012428,AKRISONER,2017-08-31 17:30:00,5558,i fished a tourny on pigeon last weekend and the friggin water was 68!  I can honestly say that the pointe au baril area literally topped out at 70 degrees this year...unbelievable.
1012436,jimmer,2017-08-31 19:08:00,2730,I saw the results of those tournaments.  It looks like other than the top teams most struggled to put anything decent in the boat. I had fished the lake on the Saturday and found it tough.
1012438,DJGeneral,2017-08-31 19:52:00,163,my favourite time of the year for fishing! Fall fishing can be hit or miss well in this case it is for me since I don't got a boat anymore! lol
1012444,OhioFisherman,2017-08-31 20:44:00,6623,"October used to be a good month for me smallie fishing on Lake Erie, getting good enough weather and finding them could be a problem."

1012453,Joeytier,2017-08-31 21:58:00,3990,"5 degrees this morning, huge smallies chomping in 2-4 feet of water.  It is shaping up to be an excellent September for lakers and brook trout to round off the season."
