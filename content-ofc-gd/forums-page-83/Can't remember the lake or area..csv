1012029,floater,2017-08-24 23:52:00,220,On the way to Lake Nipigon we talked to an older gentleman who had the same truck camper and boat set up we did. He mentioned he was headed to an lake up near Timmins that has crown land camping on the north shore. It was called something like Kapkakong Lake. I can't find it on the road map or google cus I bet i'm spelling it wrong. Would anyone have an idea what i'm talking about? The lake itself is off of the same named road. Long shot I know but i'm looking for a place to go a little closer than Nipigon in september.

Pretty much all crown land surrounding according to my maps anyways.  Bring warm clothes it was 3 degrees and frost this morning."
1012071,floater,2017-08-25 21:57:00,220,3 degrees?????? Crap. If this keeps up the ice fishing stuff will be prepped and ready for October!
