I have been told one can never be too old to do something or learn new tricks, not always, sometimes 58 is old and too old to learn new tricks. Comparing riding a bicycle and riding a bike is like saying I should be able to fly a plane because I know how to drive a car."
1011527,hirk,2017-08-17 14:06:00,571,"A good plan would be to take the safety course which will allow you to get your m1 and see how you like it and if your capable all without having to buy a bike or get insurance. If you buy one check insurance premiums on that model before buying it. I started riding last summer with 3 yrs previous experience but had not rode since I was 40 and am 57 now and love it, run to work and all over on it. You risk your like waking up, everything in degrees but if you dress for a fall you are much more likely to walk away."

Always get good advice here from Guys that know. Cheers Peter  Nothing to be scared of really. If you can ride a bicycle, you can ride a motorcycle. On my daily commute I am riding with no hands on the bars for a good 5-10 kms, just using body english to navigate slight bends in the road and to counter wind.  If you're a bad driver in a car/truck or have poor situational awareness you should likely stick to 4 wheels. Most people who wipe out on bikes fall into this category. Observe other vehicles and learn to anticipate what their next move will be, drive according to conditions, maintain your bike properly and you won't wipe out.  Defensive driving is key.  Start small (250-500cc) as the smaller bikes are typically lighter and much easier to learn on.   You can get your M1 and be riding the same day. I suggest spending the $40 or whatever it is to get your M1 and buy a cheap little bike just to see if you like it. You'll be out very little money to see if riding is really for you or not. Give it a good 500-1000 kms before deciding to give yourself a chance to relax and enjoy the ride as everyone is a bit nervous while learning.  Expect to pay around $40/month for insurance on a 250cc and it goes up significantly with engine size. Insurance companies I contacted stated they base their rates strictly on engine size and the make/model/year of bike is irrelevant. Best prices I found on a 600cc was $60-70, 800cc was around $90, and 1000cc was $130/month."

That's brutal, all because some twit decided it would be a good idea to cross the line on what's apparently a blind curve.  It's a good idea to be in the ""driver side"" tire track of the lane most times, but when it comes to blind hills and curves I always shift to the shoulder side of the lane just in case someone isn't holding their lane.   Shortly after the initial crash, another northbound motorcyclist collided with a car that had stopped at the scene and another northbound motorcyclist went off the roadway and into the ditch on Sunday August 20th.  What that says to me is these other two guys who wiped out were not driving according to conditions. Limited visibility = slow down."

1011394,aplumma,2017-08-15 20:46:00,6896,"I have rode and built  motorcycles since 1978 . I have been on bikes as small as 350 up to 1200 cc from cruisers to full blown race bikes. I have gone down on a bike twice and walked away from them with no broken bones but lots of aches and pains. That all said the first bike needs to be small enough for you to be able to manhandle it such as a 350 or 400 in an cruiser style very basic and under powered for attempting 2 people rides. After you get comfortable and master the bike then you might feel like getting a 650 or greater and be able to ride 2 people. Personally I do not ride 2 up because if they get hurt or killed it would make me feel like I was the reason for this. I will say the ability to ride a bike has no bearing on riding a motorcycle because of the weight difference, acceleration and braking do not cross over. If you do decide that you want to get a motorcycle you might want to find an old dirt bike and trail ride it to see if you have the low speed balance and coordination before going on the road. You can always trade or sell it if you do decide to get a road bike.   Art"

1011399,cheaptackle,2017-08-15 20:59:00,849,"As was mentioned before - check into the insurance issues before you commit yourself.  I've had my motorcycle license since I was 16, BUT because I haven't owned (read maintain active paid insurance on) a bike for many years I found out it would cost as much/more for insurance than for a couple of bikes I was considering - and they weren't big hawg cruisers either!  My landlord thought he would save a ton using a bike he bought that needed ""minor"" work (if he could ever get it to run), spent a few hundred on parts, (didn't get it to run) then he went out and got the biker leather jacket & gloves, high end helmet (bike still not running) went and failed his motorcycle course twice before getting the learner permit (bike still not running - used a loaner) then went and asked about insurance (bike still not running - this is now 3 years I'm watching all this and bashing him over the head about checking into insurance) and found out it would cost him 3-4 times more for the insurance than what he could possibly hope to save in gas etc in his car.  Jacket, helmet & gloves (about 800.00 worth) in the closet, bike in the shed (STILL not running).  He's out quite a chunk of change with a bunch of unused stuff (including the bike)  just because he wouldn't make the call to enquire about insurance FIRST. Now if insurance costs (along with all the rest) are not a concern then indulge yourself but DO take the safety courses, both for the learning and the riding experience.  Initially, try to ride with at least one other bike if not a group (safety in numbers) and do remember you can't carry a passenger until you are fully licensed, insured, equipped, trained and experienced!  Get through all that and then you will indeed have FUN!  Michael"

Your not a tiny guy but not big either, I'm not sure if Honda still make the Rebel but something akin to it would be a perfect beginners bike. Lightweight so you can learn to ride properly (counter steering is a thing to wrap your head around) & if you lay it down easy enough to pick up. You can always move up in CC's when you have a good feel for riding, If the wife wants to ride it would be better for her to ride her own machine instead of being the monkey (sidecar racing term) especially if you're a new rider"

Seen it getting a snack, it's locked up inside between the pizza place and the gas station. I do echo the comments on cost and safety.  I looked into it last year (in my 40's) just to putt to work and back and nope, wasn't going to save anything.  I had my dirtbike growing up and like MrB I had access to a Ninja 750r to also play with.  You may be better off with dual e-bike's for you and the Mrs if you must be on 2 wheels.  I think an older car would be a better idea as then you can get 'casual' insurance as it's not a daily driver."
1011406,aplumma,2017-08-15 22:03:00,6896,The cost of insurance down here must be a lot cheaper. I have all of my insurance thru the same company and it cost only $75 dollars a year for each of the 4 bikes I own. They are limited use vehicles meaning I ride them less than 7500 miles a year. So check around and see if raising the deductible to $1000.oo or limit the mileage or time of year you can ride.  If you can find an old rebel it will be a great bike to learn on. A Yamaha Maxium 650 would be a nice second bike being easy to balance and cut low enough to put your feet on the ground. Both of them are inexpensive and well supported still.   Art

I have shopped around and haven't found much better (am with CAA right now).  Bear in mind that currently there's a 30-35% difference in our dollars and add in our government is involved to ""help"".  I believe my Landlord was going to be in the 1,500.00 plus (maybe more) per year for his bike (think he paid 750.00 to buy the bike) as a new rider, and would have been lucky if he could ride it 7-8 months of the year.
