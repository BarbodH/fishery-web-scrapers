My name is Ken and I live with my family (wife Trish, our four adorable children Melissa, Jonathan, Michelle and Rebecca and family pooch Patches) From May to October we live on a beutiful  Island in the South Bay of Lake Nipissing, (We call it The rock)  I am so fortunate to spend summers  at the lake.  Question How do I send a few pictures with this? later Ken."
