58697,Victor,2007-04-11 19:34:00,1609,"man o man, i think you really should go back to work CC ... for the following reasons ...  1) all the steelhead would be able to take a break from eating your speical bait and start spawning (lol) 2) you would not get any PM with profanity and offensive words sent from jealous/angry people as the one i was about to send out  just kidding  don't mind me, i am jealous though, stupid work  once again great report!.."
58699,xrap,2007-04-11 19:39:00,683,Nice chromers. Looking to get out on the water friday hope they clear up by then. How was the water clarity today?
58711,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 19:54:00,7971,"Scott....well, I'm at a loss for words here.  No matter what kind of conditions....choc milk, gin clear, you bring them in every time you go out!  Awesome looking fish there!  Xrap...I'd assume the waters were gin clear today....gonna get bad tomorrow I would think since the rain is supposed to continue until the afternoon....Friday may be ok with a bit of luck...I'm assuming Sat or Sun may be prime conditions again."
