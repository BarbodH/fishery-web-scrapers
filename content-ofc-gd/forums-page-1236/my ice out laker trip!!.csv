58649,carll2,2007-04-11 18:23:00,443,"tuesday april 10th  me and a couple friends had the itch to fish, but seeing in quebec not much is open we opted to go for a 2 hourdrive to vermont where you can fish lake champlain for lake trout,browns,and landlocked salmon all season long. basically we werent sure if the ice would be out of not so we were praying that it would be,on the way down it wasnt looking too good with atleast half of the bays and boat launches still locked up with ice.  we arrive to our spot. yes the ice is gone,we talked to a local and the ice had gone the day prior. by 7am we were out on the water searching for them lakers.  here i am keeping an eye out on things since we had seen lots of baitfish on our sonar     heres what i nailed watching them baitfish, fish came out in 15 fow.     releasing her..even though you dont see much     next was a double header, my rod goes off and so does my buddys..yes fishh on!!     our rigger set-up   we also used planner boards    all in all we were 3 in the boat , i ended up landing 3 lakers  and my 2 friends got 2 each. so in our boat total count was 7. we also had 2 friends in another boat fishing  with us and they caught a total of 6. all lakers were between 5-9lbs  most fish were caught just by flatlining spoons/streamers and  yozuri minnows and rapalas.. we caught 1 fish on the downrigger and that was it, and nothing for the planner boards.  water was damnnn cold, and it was about 0 degrees all day with a 5k wind  id definately go back soon, there was hardly anybody , gotta love fishing during the week  so thats my report enjoy    btw: those wondering if we had life jackets yes we did , they were there in the boat ready for us"
