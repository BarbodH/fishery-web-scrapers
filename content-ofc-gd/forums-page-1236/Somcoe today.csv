35558,icefisherman,2007-02-17 00:51:00,952,"Well...tired again from hard walking, but happy to have something good to report...started early at 35' and kept drilling all the way up to 100'./...got a perch in 40' and kept moving deeper...around 10:30 first laker...    A bit later decided to drop a minnow line....the moment it got down bam...fish on...lost shortly after...  30min later a bigger laker...in the blowing snow with screen and hole full of snow...couldn;t see when the fish got close to the ice...hit the ice and run away...ticked off big time...  30 min later...nice herring...down the hole it goes... then one more hit and fish on...lost again...  All my fish caught on Rapala B/W in 100 fow. Buddy of mine got one whitie on Williams and I saw two more whities on the ice today.  Slush everywhere...deep slush...ATV's barely going...very hard walk though shorter this time... Anyhow...is was a while since I had laker for dinner so it was good...but could have been better...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
