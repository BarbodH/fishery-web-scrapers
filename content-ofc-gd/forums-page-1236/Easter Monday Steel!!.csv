I don't drift for steel (I want to, just no time) but I can just imagine battling big brutes like tht in close quarters with the multiple snags around.  Truly a test of an angler's ability.  Great job to both you and Bly!"
58980,fishergirl72,2007-04-12 01:49:00,455,"WAY TO GO CLIFF AND CAROLE!   And you are right, whenever a couple sticks together and are a team they are ALOT more sucsessful in what they do! And you have proved that over and over!   I would love to get out fishing very soon! Carole, maybe you and I should head out one morning just us girls while the men are at work and the kids are in school!LOL   Sorry Cliff and Shawn!"
58985,carll2,2007-04-12 01:59:00,443,"awesome fish guys..you make me jealous ,,too bad we dont have tribs with steelhead like that here in quebec keep up the good work"
58095,discophish,2007-04-10 20:57:00,392,"Green with envy.  Great job you two!  You have been on fire!  May I suggest that you start wearing metal helmets on the river ... to become one of them ... the steelheads.  It seems you have been hanging out with them on a regular basis.  I wish I had a good relation with the fish.  They never want to be in the same picture with me.  All I get is nose in the air, flippers crossed, and a head shake ... and they take off.  Very rude.  No means no I guess.  <sigh>"
58406,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 11:43:00,7971," LOL...love the part about fish not wanting to be in the same pic as you.  Let me see if I can put it into perspective....I started trib fishing for steelies in late December.  I've been out probably 20 times since then and only managed to bring in a total of about 8 fish total.  Guys like CANADIAN COPPER do that in one day....LOL.  I've had a few surface, look right at me and then slowly swim away too...talk about maddening!!!"
