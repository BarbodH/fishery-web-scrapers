58631,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 17:53:00,7971,So...seeing as rain is in the forecast for the next few days...probably some blown tribs...you know he's out there right now...  I'm guessing he goes.....4 for 6.....no wait.....5 for 7.   Not bad for a few hours on the trib I'd say....haha.
58633,ecxstriper,2007-04-11 17:54:00,343,waiting with baited breath!!
58634,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 17:56:00,7971, Stop eating the trout roe....we need it to fish with...no wonder your breath smells like bait....LOL

58654,xrap,2007-04-11 18:30:00,683,i'll say 8/11
58658,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 18:39:00,7971, LOL...if he lands 8 then he's beaten my ENTIRE steelhead count in one outing. (I've been fishing for them since late December and have gone out probably 15 or so times since then and only landed 7).  Then again...he has done 8 and more in the past.....haha.
58662,xrap,2007-04-11 18:44:00,683,LOl I've only caught 2 small ones ever. I've been going out since  late novemebr and probally have gone out 20 times. I'm starting to get a little better at it even tho I'm not landing them. I'll be out on the tribs this friday  after the rain. Hopefully I'll get my first 5lber. I'll post a report if I catch something.
