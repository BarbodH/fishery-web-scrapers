58847,highdrifter,2007-04-11 23:53:00,2534,"Moose Tags for purchase??  I'm waiting for the draw, but I wasn't aware that you could purchase them elsewhere than an outfitter....  I need to be in the now!!  Hence, we shall need more details, please.  thanx in advance  HD"
58866,tjsa,2007-04-12 00:04:00,1578,"I believe malcolm meant to say licenses, at least for moose, dunno about turkeys, we don't have any where I am except for the usual ones that also have two legs, but cannot fly."
58886,highdrifter,2007-04-12 00:18:00,2534,"Hey TJ!!  Long time no speak.  Good to know we still have allies...  Moose licences (calf) are available for purchase yes, but bull tags??  Which brings to mind the following rant.  I have a bone to pick with our local outfitter.  We're loosing out on availability, because our local outfitter is buying the moose tags right from under us, and sending his clients to hunt a piece of land that our family has hunted for thirty years...  You got the idea what this comes down to.  Okay, now I'm ticked!!  HD"
58893,Fishmaster,2007-04-12 00:25:00,920,My shop has both turkey and moose ...just hope the 2007 Hunting Regs get out soon so guys no whats need to get tags ..
58894,tjsa,2007-04-12 00:26:00,1578,"Outfitters, as I understand it, are alloted a certain amount of tags for a certain area, based on population of animals and clientele. I could be wrong, but I do not think they are allowed to purchase any amount of tags they want for any given area, unless they are somehow doing it illegally(which is not unheard of, check the OCOA site). They eventually get caught, and prosecuted.  Are you hittin' the tribs' yet???  I still have a couple weekends before I do."
