59002,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-12 02:37:00,181,Nice fish!
58450,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 13:44:00,213,"Hi OFNers,  Just thought I'd pop in here and say hi. Is everyone enjoying spring? Beautiful, eh?  Where's all the global warming?  I expect many of you are like me in that you are in the transition mode between ice and open water. I spoke with your feerless leader here, TJ, this morning ... was telling him about my final ice fishing trip of the year in Saskatchewon. Great group of Canucks there ... they say (EH) a whole bunch there ... so I'm still saying eh ... eh?  We were on Tobin Lake in Saskatchewon, with John Gillespie's TV show (some of you know of it). Still plenty of ice there, as an auger extension was still necessary. We had a great time and caught some real nice northern pike. The biggest was a 45 1/2 inch fish with a great build, that Rob Manthei, good friend and one of our writers at the magazine got. First day was real good and then fishing got a little tougher, coupled with some bad luck, it seemed, hooking fish (which I expect was simply because fish were pretty ""off"" and not grabbing baits well). We had a great trip though ... I even got a fish on one of my 9 foot muskie rods ... pretty funny.  Well, I expect it will thaw out soon ... and we'll be  Pete"
58460,Terry,2007-04-11 13:57:00,14456,"sounds like a great way to end the season.. love John Gillespie's  show don't know where he will be fishing the next week, I like the idea of shooting a show and putting it on the air the same week..I wish a station in Ontario would pick up his show....."
58467,~CK~,2007-04-11 14:02:00,30,good to hear the saskatch won.
58470,lew,2007-04-11 14:07:00,12767,"Landing a 45 inch pike thru the ice is a pretty impressive accomplishment Pete, be good to see some pics of that brute !!  I spose it'll be in the magazine ??"
58485,Moosebunk,2007-04-11 14:22:00,3970,"I don't believe one word of this Pete.  How can I, there's not a single picture.  and we all know about the difficulties you have catching toothy fish."
58502,TJQ,2007-04-11 14:42:00,7806,LOL... Ill have to start posting reports with no pictures... then I will start to catch some big fish!!!!
58527,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 15:08:00,213,"HI,  Boy, rough crowd around here ... didn't know you Canucks were all this skeptical.  How ya doing Lew? ... good to hear from you. Of course you too Bunk and all. The show actually just aired ... so, ha ha  ... for all you doubters, there are some folks who have actually ""seen"" what we caught.  As far as pics, I have a couple issues there. First, I'm a complete computer dope, and not even remotely certain I could post a pic if I had one. Computers and me, well  The other problem is currently don't have any. I did take some stills of Rob's big one, and got some nice shots, but it was the old-fashioned slide film. I just got it back and will be getting it out to our production guy at the magazine ... and possibly after a while can get some scans. It really was a pretty fish.  Anyway, I think I'll be stepping (somewhat ... and grudgingly) into the new millenium and getting a digital camera for this coming year  Pete"
58535,lew,2007-04-11 15:19:00,12767,"Hey Pete, we've just got a policy around here......  ......if there's no pictures of the brutes......it never happened"
58585,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 16:54:00,213,I see ... good to know the policy here Lew. Guess I gotta get that new camera.
58594,Terry,2007-04-11 17:04:00,14456,"you can also draw the picture of the fish, like we did for Lew and crazy  and if you get a big one you get one of these   which would be 45"", converted to US    but you have to post pictures...lol"
58733,GbayGiant,2007-04-11 21:07:00,1780,"Oh my god, that's funny Terry.  Thanks for the story Pete, nice fish EH."
58734,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 21:08:00,213,Now that's great stuff Terry    round of applause for you.  Great drawing man!  Pete
58752,lew,2007-04-11 21:38:00,12767,"That's some funny stuff Terry, I'd forgotten all about that  Mind if I save it ??"
58756,Moosebunk,2007-04-11 21:48:00,3970,"Ahhhh dood.  Once you go digital every good fish up the hole or in the boat gets the full on ""cat walk"" treatment.   It's kinda sick in a way for the fish, as they might just develop that ""metro-gay"" sorta complex from all the attention.  Then, down the road they won't slam the baits but instead just nibble and nit-pick around the fat, maybe taste the feces and veggies in the area around the bait, then later complain about their weight and not want to eat anything at all.  Stay old school and the fishing will never change for us.  I'll take your word on your big fish this time then Pete.  Next time, scan the print and send it directly to me.  Got the photo thing down pat around here."
58757,Moosebunk,2007-04-11 21:49:00,3970,"Yeah Terry, your art sucks but in a very funny way.  And Lew should only be on $100's. lol"
58768,Bernie,2007-04-11 22:01:00,3190,Good stuff on the fishing Pete. Digital is becoming the way of the world it seems. Im still learning it too but it does get easier over time.  Funny stuff Terry and Moosebunk.   Keep it up guys.
58770,Smokey,2007-04-11 22:04:00,1278,"Looking forward to seeing the show Pete. Any Idea when it air on WFN here in Canada, if so let us know."
58771,Terry,2007-04-11 22:04:00,14456,"well when he catches a 100"" muskie I will put it on the 100 bill"
58776,GbayGiant,2007-04-11 22:09:00,1780," Ye, but the fish looks over 50"" ? you might have to add a couple loonies and toonies."
58785,Terry,2007-04-11 22:21:00,14456,sorry I'm like the bus drivers...correct change only
58816,Pete Maina,2007-04-11 23:15:00,213,"You Canucks are too much ... Loonies, Toonies ... correct change  FYI Smokey that Gillespie's show doesn't air on WFN, sadly ... just The Next Bite. Hope folks are continuing to enjoy that.  Dood, ""metro-gay-sorta"" ... I think I will stay old school and risk being called a liar  Pete"
58825,Mike the Pike,2007-04-11 23:22:00,3421,"Terry  We need pics Pete.Pics Pete, Pics Pete,Pics pete"
58832,Terry,2007-04-11 23:36:00,14456,or.........    
58881,Smokey,2007-04-12 00:14:00,1278,Thanks Pete. I didn't read the first part of the post well enough or I'd have known that.  Have a good night
58990,Pete Maina,2007-04-12 02:11:00,213,"Hi all,  Appreciate the comments and correspondence today from folks here ... pics, pics, pics ... OK, I'll try to remember ... had some good laughs.

Musta been that rocking fishin' tune and ...  Well, sadly, to Minneapolis for meetings tomorrow and Green Bay next day for seminars ... you Canucks be good!"
