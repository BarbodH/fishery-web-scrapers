58256,finfan,2007-04-11 01:34:00,44,Just thought I'd give them a thumbs up! They've given us some exciting ball this season. A real team we should be proud of...EH!
58286,GbayGiant,2007-04-11 02:05:00,1780,"Yup, they are doing great, surprised me this year for sure."
58288,Rizzo,2007-04-11 02:10:00,4754,"I am a LONG SUFFERING fan.  Finally some success again.  Nice to see Miama choking the last few games as well.  A date with the Wizards, or even better, Wince and the Nets would be fine with me"
58322,charlied,2007-04-11 03:10:00,584,They are really playing this half of the season...hope they go the distance!
58326,urbanangler1990,2007-04-11 03:16:00,933,"yup its been a looonnngg timee, we are playing awsome, they play like they been playing together for some years, great chemestry, no one thought theyd be this good soo fast"
58327,Hooked,2007-04-11 03:16:00,891,"Glad to see some other Raptor fans out there.  They have played some great ball this year, and most importantly, have finished games.  Love to see them against the Wizards, down 2 of their best players, can't ask for much more than that.  Go RAPS!"
58333,kennyman,2007-04-11 03:34:00,737,"Yep,CB4 is incredible. The management really has collected a very nice young core and somehow picked the perfect support players. Attitude is everything.  If they let Colangelo do his thing they should only get better over next few years. You gotta love it."
58341,Minnow,2007-04-11 04:02:00,177,"Raps have been playing the best ball I have seen from them in a while and can't wait for playoffs to start, I really think that they have a good chace this year at making a good run towards the finals. Will be cheering for them all the way"
58431,Victor,2007-04-11 13:08:00,1609,Certainly they're doing amazing. There's always someone who would step up when other are having a cold night. Just hoping that bargnani can come back soon.  Go Raps!
58432,Terry,2007-04-11 13:11:00,14456,oh.... had to google it  Raptor a basketball team in toronto.....  so do hockey players play that in the off season
58458,David Chong,2007-04-11 13:54:00,836,GO RAPTORS GO!!!!!!
58487,Puckhead,2007-04-11 14:23:00,377, hahaha!!!
58563,urbanangler1990,2007-04-11 16:11:00,933,  is that a joke? cause its halarious
58568,Terry,2007-04-11 16:23:00,14456,JOKE ? ...yes I was being a smart @$$
58571,ribak,2007-04-11 16:26:00,19,"bargnani should be back this friday...hopefully hes in full form one thing thats great about the raptors is their depth, some teams rely heavily on 1 or 2 players, but after bosh, raps have some great secondary players seems like raps can beat anyone in the east except possibly detroit (yes they can handle chi-town, miami, and cleveland)"
58729,urbanangler1990,2007-04-11 20:53:00,933,okk then...
58744,GbayGiant,2007-04-11 21:22:00,1780,"Terry quit being a smart @$$.  You'd be surprised how many Canadians don't know we have a professional basketball team (the Raptors) use to have the Grizzlies in Vancouver but they only lasted 3 or 4 years in the NBA.  Canadians are programed for Hockey.   I wish Toronto got a NFL team but too with the CFL they won't allow it, but what I find funny is all the players in the CFL are Americans anyway, so is it really Canadian ?  We also got Steve Nash (from BC) in the NBA with 2 MVP's the last two years in a row and he could get it again this year, he is a legend in the NBA and that is a almost impossible task, and more Americans know who he is than Canadians."
