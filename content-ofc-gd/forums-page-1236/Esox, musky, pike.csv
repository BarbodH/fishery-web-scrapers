58106,GbayGiant,2007-04-10 21:17:00,1780,"Well, I seen these pics on one of those other sites.  Thought is was interesting because last year I witnessed a musky eat a large seagull off the serface of the water and I thought I was hallucinating but a friend told me the next day that he seen a floating musky with a seagull wing sticking out of her mouth. ( they choke on seagulls, with all the bones )  Here is an example of what a little Pike can do, so imagine what a 50lbs musky can eat.  Keep your small dogs and infants out of big musky water.       "
58110,express168,2007-04-10 21:26:00,327,"A long time ago while fishing Nippissing with my older brother we saw a seagull get hit , water and feathers everywhere. The seagull rolled over and there was a big bite out of the side, my brother looked at me and said one word, ""MUSKY"". I will never forget seeing that."
58116,GbayGiant,2007-04-10 21:35:00,1780," The one I seen, it took three hits and a lot of screaming and feathers flying before the musky finally submerged the bird. Nature at it's finest, I bet the musky didn't expect it to be her last meal though."
58192,Fishn Technishn,2007-04-11 00:09:00,198,Maybe we can train Muskies to eat CORMORANTS!!!!  FT
58234,lunkerbasshunter,2007-04-11 00:59:00,2585,i have seen a pike grab a small duckling.  On belmont lake in havelock.  the pike didnt look ot big either.  maybe 8 or 9 pounds.  Im sure it happens more often then we think but it was somehting that I will never forget.  Cheers!
58273,Bob,2007-04-11 01:51:00,370,That looks like a young cormorant in that pike.  I once saw a good sized pike come 3 feet out of the water and take a swallow that was chasing bugs.  Don't know how he coordinated a hit on that fast moving bird but he nailed it right out of mid air.
58291,Rizzo,2007-04-11 02:13:00,4754, that would be amazing to see
58303,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-11 02:39:00,181,Thanks for the interesting post!
58306,fishindevil,2007-04-11 02:41:00,6254,"Wow...thats very interesting,and i know its well documented about musky and pike eating small ducks and other birds i have heard pete mania talk about them also eating muskrats and other rodents and reptiles as well i guess they also eat water snakes too....they sure can have big apetites cant they..???    thanks for posting that report     cheers"
58325,tbayboy,2007-04-11 03:16:00,1497,I saw this when browsing a Cabelas sale last week:  Waston's Baby Duck    Guess this post shows it would work.
58342,Sinker,2007-04-11 04:05:00,8692,I had one try and take a duck decoy on sturgeon lake once. It hit it 3 times before it gave up. I thought my decoy was toast for sure.....he was a brute!  Sinker
58353,tundra,2007-04-11 05:45:00,18,"At my Grandfathers cottage, (Shadow Lake, Norland), every spring a family of ducks would swim by with 8-10 babies.  Each day there would be 1 less swimming with them."
58355,musky66,2007-04-11 06:19:00,273,"Years back I winessed a gull go down and not come up on the Muskoka River- not a Musky, but I've seen 30 lb plus Pike come out of there!"
58360,Mattitude,2007-04-11 07:28:00,155,"I used to work at a resort and they had a duck pond.  Each year the swans would have Signets sp? and apparently there was a massive snapping turtle that would take them all the time.  I remember seeing around six of them, next day five and so on usually only 1 or 2 survived."
58379,aplumma,2007-04-11 10:29:00,6896,Now you know were one legged seagulls come from. Turtles and muskies and pike o myyyy.   Art
58388,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-11 10:48:00,621,Ya know what Art I am told they even eat bucktails
58389,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-11 10:49:00,0,"The Iowa state record Muskie puked up a 2 pound seagull, after the weigh in as well."
58397,ccmtcanada,2007-04-11 11:24:00,7971,The things that happen in nature are amazing!  Thanks for posting your pic...must have been a surprise to see a bird come out of that pike!
58457,bassmaster4,2007-04-11 13:54:00,801,did u still eat the pike after you found out the bird was in it?
58469,mattyk,2007-04-11 14:05:00,2110,i once caught a pike from the Nottowasaga that had a big mouse in its stomach.
58483,Pigeontroller,2007-04-11 14:20:00,2793,I think i'll have to pick up a few new Topwater baits at the Odyssey this weekend!
