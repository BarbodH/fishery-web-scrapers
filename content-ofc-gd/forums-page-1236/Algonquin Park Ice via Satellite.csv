53284,Nemo,2007-03-30 00:45:00,727,Not for the opener but we are heading in at the end of May for four days. Can't wait. Cookslav you going in?
53344,Cookslav,2007-03-30 06:21:00,1457,"Yes sir...2nd till the 9th and I can't wait!!!  Destination is unknown yet Depends on the crew.... I was planning a route to Hogan, but if my Dads comming thats a bit aggressive for him... So we may alter the route and head south through ragged into procupine, and see how close to welcome Lake we can get over the week. not a huge excursion but good enough."
53393,Nemo,2007-03-30 13:31:00,727,Send me a PM if you end up going into Hogan I have some info that may be useful.
53404,icefisherman,2007-03-30 14:21:00,952," Hey Nemo, if this is an open invitation I might join you...I'll be back in the park end of August (after great time we had last August on Opeongo I can not resist repeating it;-). This year it'll be just me and now 2 year old son.  I'd love to go deep in the interior myself though before that...it'll be nice to go for the first time with someone more experienced in Algonquin interior...and knowing you as such (including great fisherman) I can not think of a better choice ...so yes....if you have spot for me let me know  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
53413,douG,2007-03-30 15:07:00,2693,"I'll be arriving at the park office on Opeongo on Tuesday, May 6 for four nights in.  I hope our spot on the north arm is all set up by the advance troops by then.  Some of our crew will be trekking to Hogan, Nemo.  Please forward your info to me too, with thanks."
53521,fishindevil,2007-03-30 21:06:00,6254,"WOW..  ..the details are so clear,well it wont be long now till most of southern ontario will be ice-free,and it appears that lake ontario and most of her harbours are open as well....i might hit the pickering nuke plant soon....cheers"
54447,Nemo,2007-04-02 18:12:00,727,Today's Image  Looks like a little progress. Who says I have cabin fever  
54448,Nemo,2007-04-02 18:16:00,727,Oh yeah and the rest of the lakes here..  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...es.143.250m.jpg
54453,douG,2007-04-02 18:27:00,2693,"Keep those iceout reports coming, John.  Thanks!"
58908,Nemo,2007-04-12 00:40:00,727,THe latest sattelite photos of APP at Opeongo for those of you looking forward to the Trout Opener.     Soon
58912,carll2,2007-04-12 00:44:00,443,hey nemo i want satelite shots for quebec to monitor the ice..do you know where i can find them> thanks
58917,mason05,2007-04-12 00:48:00,258,I sure hope the ice is out sooner than later.  I'll be on Carl Wilson the first weekend of May in search of trout.  Can't wait to get in there and enjoy what the park has to offer this year.  Corn Nug
58972,Nemo,2007-04-12 01:29:00,727,"Carll2 I got mine from here  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html  It looks to be all focused on the Great Lakes Basin. Have a look see.  There is lots of sattelite images of Quebec but they are not current. Maybe check with environment Canada..sorry  Corn Nug .. Let me know how you do on CW for the Opener. It was on the list of possibles for last year but I didn't get to it.  This weather though may make it tough on ice out on the bigger lakes.  I remember getting stuck in the ice on Merchant May 10, 1997. Here the trend.     You may want to stay posted here: http://www.electricpenguin.com/iceout/  The Tornados last year in August apparently also slammed that area. Apparently lots of trees down on the portages. I think it has been dealt with. CW apparently has some giant boulders in it and general rocky structure."
58981,mason05,2007-04-12 01:51:00,258,"Thanks Nemo.  I think we'll be ok but you never know what mother nature has in her back pocket. Here's a pic of a days catch last year to wet your appetite.    Cheers,  Corn Nug"
58998,Nemo,2007-04-12 02:29:00,727,Nice One. Blue Tarp and Lakers.....ahh the memories.
59009,Cookslav,2007-04-12 02:51:00,1457,"It better start warming up soon.... 3 weeks from today I plan to wet my paddles, and the snow right now has me nervous..."
