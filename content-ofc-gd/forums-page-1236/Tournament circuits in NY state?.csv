I've been wanting to do some buddy tournaments with my cousin from Connecticutt who is a hardcore bass fisherman! This area is a good half way point for the both of us and a real great opportunity to spend a lot more time together doing what we both love. I've fished Champlain a fair bit with him but want to fish other waters such as Oneida Lake and the Hudson River near Catskills. Has anyone fished these waters? Hows the fishing? Any general information that could be used to start would be greatly appreciated. e.g. water color, angling methods used, baits/color and possibly areas to look at?"

Our Club and some others had small tournaments on Findley( a small lake ). Just my understanding that Chautaqua has a lot of them and some are bigger( a bigger lake ). Seen and caught some nice fish out of both. New York has some nice lakes!"
