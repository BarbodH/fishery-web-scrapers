Definately need optical zoom too, probably at least 5 MP's as well.  Any help would be great.  Been checking out Cnet, Zdnet so far."
58345,jediangler,2007-04-11 04:24:00,1923,Try Kodak. They have a couple models that should fall into your category. I've been using Kodak digitals since 2001 without a problem.

58590,Paulus,2007-04-11 17:00:00,522,"Stay AWAY from Kodak! They are too slow. Cannon and Sony are best. Since Sony took over Minolta, their technology has vastly improved. Most cameras have zoom of some sort, so you're ok there. Also, make sure the data storage card is SD. They are cheaper and more universal. For good deals, take a look at XS cargo. http://www.shopxscargo.com/product_catalog...?category_id=19"
