58490,taper,2007-04-11 14:25:00,611,TJ I have never seen this magazine before can it be bought on news stands?
58492,TJQ,2007-04-11 14:26:00,7806,http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=5808  Yup....
58560,mdej,2007-04-11 16:06:00,98," According to their website it can be purchased at newsstands.  However I have looked everywhere since Feb trying to find it.  Have had no luck so far.  Even the mega chapters downtown did not have it.  Ah now I see TJ's thread, seems that OFC is more up to date then their own website.  2 - 10 days I will check again on the weekend."
