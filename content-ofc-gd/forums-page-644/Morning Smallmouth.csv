494502,ctranter,2010-08-14 23:26:00,543,"Hey Everyone!  Despite forecasts for rain, I decided to head out on the lake this morning.  It was unusually windy for first thing in the morning, which was messing with my trolling speed.  Started off chuckin jigs and senkos at my favourite drop offs but only landed 2 average bass.  Decided to try a hole that used to produce regular monster smallies a few years ago, but recently was just average.  Sure enough this hog slammed my crankbait and put up a hell of a fight.  He was shakin the lure at the surface and I was really worried that I would lose him at the boat.   Such a fattie, which is pretty uncommon for the lake.   Measurement (17"", need to buy digital scale!!!)   Self-timer from the dock (No, I don't keep Bass, he swam away with vigor)   I turned the boat around, and went back to same drift path with the same crankbait and another one slightly smaller just hammered the floating crank as soon as it hit the water.  This bass cleared the water 3 times, once had to be at least 4 feet out of the water.   One more self-timer   Here's a summary:  Fished ~ 3 hours, caught 8 Smallmouth (2> 16"") Air Temp - 25 deg c Water temp - 74 deg f Wind - Strong, NW direction What worked:  Lucky Craft transparent perch pattern floating series (4-5' dive), Bubblegum & Pumpkinseed coloured senko's, Drop shot live worms Depth - Fished rocky drop off points that transition from 12 ft to 5 ft"

494531,OhioFisherman,2010-08-15 01:25:00,6623,Nice! It`s funny how you can catch them in the same spot or area and one will be a fat pig and another the same size will be streamlined? Some may start they fall feed early?
