In other words, if someone were to give you a set of coordinates so you can find the spot, how can you enter them? As usual I've read the manual and apparently am too stupid to figure it out. Thanks to all who respond."

494620,Sinker,2010-08-15 14:15:00,8692,"Yup, what fish finder said.  Just hold the enter button down. It will ask you if its OK to save the WP, but before you click OK, cursor up to the coordinates for the spot your in, and change them to the spot you want. Easy, sleasy.  S."
