Did a little channel surfing and came back to Hamilton's channel 11 and there was Lorie and OFC's Fishfarmer representing the Stelco Fishing Club and promoting the family fishing derby tomorrow.  Dave, keep it up and your going to have your own   fishing show. Good job ol' buddy right here"

492964,Fish Farmer,2010-08-09 18:17:00,2234,"Thanks Harry. I didn't think anyone would have been up at that time. I was at a meeting with the Hamilton Harbor Front Trust last week, the Committee guys from the Stelco Club, Dofasco club and a chap from fisheries and oceans said I was the man to go in front of the CH Morning Live camera. I think my Buddy's set it up because my mouth is always flapping at our meetings  , so guess what.  Man, it's different when a camera is in your face  , couldn't get the mouth to flap like it does at our meetings. Lori is a very nice person, even off camera. This Sat. if you have any little ones, bring them down to the Police Dock Harbor Front 8 AM. There is a 1000 Rod & Reel combos that we give out to the kids. Every fish a kid catches, they'll get a entry ticket that goes in a drum for draws at the end of the day for Lots of prizes. At the Stelco Club booth we give a free bag of candy for the first 100 kids that catch a fish. It's all FREE. So, come on out guys, bring the kids. Thanks Guys"
