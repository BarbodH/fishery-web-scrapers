494656,SudburyAngler,2010-08-15 17:02:00,154,"thats a nice one, nothing like a big walleye, gets you going eh"
494670,fish_fishburn,2010-08-15 17:20:00,1311,"Atta boy, you don't catch them everyday out of the Ottawa. Any wallleye I have ever caught in the Ottawa in that size range have all been in under eight feet and mostly in the spring time shortly after season opens."

494877,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-16 13:01:00,0,Congrats on the PB! Being caught casting as opposed to trolling is an extra bonus!
494879,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-16 13:04:00,2690,"Congrats, a beautiful ""walter""!!!"
494914,frozen-fire,2010-08-16 14:51:00,542,I really like that release vid! Makes me want to invest in a waterpoof point and shoot camera.  Congrats on the PB walleye.
