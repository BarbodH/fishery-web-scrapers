494232,hirk,2010-08-13 22:20:00,571,"Thx HTHM,I'll try them Brian I can run it as is no problem,just don't want it cracking too much more and ending up in pieces.It's custom made,no swaping it out,I could just take it off but it serves a purpose so would rather weld it."
494253,vinnimon,2010-08-14 00:24:00,2593,  There are lots of tractor/trailer repair shops around along the 401 corridor.They do alot of alum welding as well.
494378,Tybo,2010-08-14 14:53:00,1373,Myself would replace it.It crack once do to stress. Welding it would make it weaker.
