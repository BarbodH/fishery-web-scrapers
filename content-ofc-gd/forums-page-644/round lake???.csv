494825,jediangler,2010-08-16 03:33:00,1923,Which one? There are so many Round lakes in Ontario. I know a little about the one up by Barry's Bay if that's the one you mean.
494828,johnl,2010-08-16 03:41:00,197,i'm pretty sure the one i'm talking about is in the kawarthas.So i'm assuming it has musky walleye basss crappie etc.
