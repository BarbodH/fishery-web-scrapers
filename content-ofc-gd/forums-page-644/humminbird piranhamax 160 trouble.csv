Is it a pretty good sign that when depths start going crazy , and the screen appears broken and marking fish that aren't there, that the battery is running very low?"
494577,alexcba,2010-08-15 08:13:00,634,"this happens often on that model.  -when the screen goes a little whack, it's just adjusting to your auto depth range.  - when you hear a beep but nothings there 1 of 2 things are happening.  1. you see a blob on the screen. i've seen alot of these usually marking a school of baitfish. (if you want a good way to test this toss out a very tiny lure, and see what you pull up, i've nailed perch and shiners all kinds when this was happening. )  2. your over a very weedy flat bottom and there's a fish burried underneath all the crud."
