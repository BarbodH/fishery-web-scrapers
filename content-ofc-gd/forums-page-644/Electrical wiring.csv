494469,walleyejack,2010-08-14 20:59:00,358,Think i had enough for today hahaha. Will take apart the one i put in a few years ago in the other room and see what it looks like tomorrow. Maybe good fortune will shine on me Sunday.  Thanks for all the help guys  Al
494473,toca,2010-08-14 21:22:00,274,return the light fixture and tell them you want a new one and ur money back!
494474,toca,2010-08-14 21:23:00,274,also google aluminum wiring.
494558,Whopper,2010-08-15 03:28:00,2174,Call Sparky
494569,nofish4me,2010-08-15 04:49:00,404,"Just by chance, there wouldn't happen to be more than one light switch that would operate this fan?"
494605,walleyejack,2010-08-15 13:12:00,358,Only 1 light switch
494611,Terry,2010-08-15 13:33:00,14456,on the fixture...blues and blacks together..put them on the single white  white wire on fixture goes to the 2 white wires in the box..and damn it that should work...LOL
494615,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-15 13:51:00,0,  Now what would that do seeing as there are a few Licensed sparkys in this thread already... Terry has it right and he's not licensed.
494630,walleyejack,2010-08-15 15:05:00,358,"Terry, took er back and got another one. will try it again, dang, this might start me to drinkin in my hot rod lincoln, and i haven t had a drink in 3 months.. lol  Thanks Al"
494637,toca,2010-08-15 16:04:00,274,yeah no problem
494643,Terry,2010-08-15 16:12:00,14456, Yeah but I did stay at a Holiday Inn
494648,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-15 16:39:00,0,  When you stayed there did you do any wire pulling?
494666,walleyejack,2010-08-15 17:16:00,358,"EUREKA !!!!!  Fianlly got it working, had so much confidence in fellow OFC ers, that i didn t even test it as I went along,put the whole thing together,blades,lights, and sure enough,flipped the switch and it didn t work.  Then i pulled the chain. I thank everyone immensley for their input, and Terry who dug and kept coming up with suggestions.  Thanks everyone."
494667,dave524,2010-08-15 17:16:00,4508,"I'm not an electrician, but I have done 4 fan/light combos in my home, all with switches for the light, three were retrofitting an existing light fixture and one was a new installation in the middle of the living room when I got a gas fireplace. All are wired the same, so the fan is allways live to the pull chain and the light is switched by the light switch, the pull chain for it is left on. I would say what we need to do is identify the pair of wires that go to the light switch, is that possible ? is there attic access ? What I've done is connect the black from the switch alone to the blue light wire, I then  put a black band with marker on the white wire from the switch for future reference at the fan electrical box, connect all your black wires and the black banded wire together and the white wires together , guess the ground doesn't come in play here as it is only a 2 wire circuit. That should take care of it if I understand the problem correctly.  edit: I'm assuming the only wire going to the switch is the one dropped down a wall from the fan and there is not any run direct fron the fuse / breaker box."
494680,Terry,2010-08-15 17:59:00,14456, LOL..NO I just gave instructions on how to do it...........
494695,toca,2010-08-15 19:01:00,274,Interesting.....
494698,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-15 19:21:00,0, Must be nice being paid well and having someone else pull your wire all day.  Desiganted wire pullers...
494700,Terry,2010-08-15 19:40:00,14456,I find strippers make the best wire pullers........  they are so eager to learn
494706,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-15 20:06:00,0,  As long as they don't nick the wires it's ok. You have to make sure you have good strippers though eh...
494707,toca,2010-08-15 20:06:00,274,yeah for a price
494416,walleyejack,2010-08-14 17:57:00,358,"Not sure if anyonc can help, but would appreciate it. I have an older house,lots of 2 wire wiring, I am replacing a ceiling fixture with a fan,i took the old fixtre out which has two receptacles in it,there is 3 sets of wires in the box,3 blacks tied together, 1 white hooked into another white,then the 2 whites, I tied the wires in the fan to appropriate colors,and blew the breaker,took 1 white out and no power, same with the other white when i switched, I am not sure what to do now.I put 1 in my kitchen yrs ago and had no problems. Any ideas would be appreciated, there was a green wire in the fan to hook to ground wire, but i don t have a ground wire in box. Thanks Al"
494417,Roy,2010-08-14 18:00:00,13728,The green ground will go to the frame of the box.
494418,Terry,2010-08-14 18:06:00,14456,I take it there is a light switch on the wall in which case the single white would go to the black wire on the fan and the double white wire would go to the white wire on the fan  green is ground
494420,walleyejack,2010-08-14 18:23:00,358,ok    let me try that Roy.    got my cell handy here for fire dpt.  Thank you.
494422,toca,2010-08-14 18:35:00,274,"Ceiling Fans Should Have Three Wires Including Ground. Black, Blue(or Red) and white. Green or Bare is your ground. The Other wire is your support wire that you just loop it to a secure screw or hook depending on the model/make of the fan. Before trying to figure out the wiring open the light switch box like terry mentions to find out whats there  1) Find your neutral(white) and tie them together.  2) Find your Switch Wire Where It Should Be Just One Black Wire Unless you have multiple lights controlled by one switch.  3) ""3 sets of wires in the box,3 blacks tied together, 1 white hooked into another white,then the 2 whites"" im going to assume one of your 2 white wires is your control/swtich wire."
494425,walleyejack,2010-08-14 18:41:00,358,"I tried what Terry mentioned, no luck, the 3 blacks in the box are tied together, one white is tied into another white, then there is the single white and the two tied together, tried Terrys suggestion,got no power to my switch,(swithc ligths up when off) I m pretty much lost. but Thank you for the help"
494426,Terry,2010-08-14 18:42:00,14456,"I believe that my answer is correct, if there is a light switch   the 3 black wires 2 are live the third black wire goes to the switch and comes back to the box as white and that would be the single one the 2 whites together are live..... so  single white would go to the black wire on the fan and the double white wire would go to the white wire on the fan"
494428,walleyejack,2010-08-14 18:44:00,358,"I tried that Terry, no luck, but thanks"
494429,toca,2010-08-14 19:03:00,274,"Eh Jack.  You Didnt happen to take the old light fixture out and some how ""forgot"" which goes where?  Because if there is only one black wire and one white wire in the light switch box then the white wire should have constant power and the black wire is the return power for the light fixture.  in your situation you have all three black wires tied together and one white wire going back to neutral always blowing the breaker when you flip the switch aka shorting the circuit.  so it really should be two blacks with a white wire tied together(cap it off and never touch it again) then it should be the two white wires which are your neutral and one black wire that should be ur switch/control wire.  do you have a volt tester?"
494431,walleyejack,2010-08-14 19:07:00,358,"no volt tester, when i took it apart thats how they were, 3 blacks tied up,1 white into another,then 2 whites left. the old receptacle had two fixtures in it and tied into each other.I didn t change anything.    "
494432,walleyejack,2010-08-14 19:08:00,358,there was 1 white wire each going to the wires in the receptacle.    
494433,Terry,2010-08-14 19:15:00,14456,but wasn't there a total of 3 white wires  2 tied together and one by itself  how did you have 2 single wires going to the light fixture??  or I am not understanding
494434,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-14 19:17:00,0,never mind....lol
494436,walleyejack,2010-08-14 19:18:00,358,"You are understanding correctly. 2 sockets in the light fixture.2 black and 2 white tied together, then out of the box there was a single white to 1 side of sockets and the dbl white to the other side of the sockets. you have it correct, but i don't "
494437,toca,2010-08-14 19:19:00,274,can you take a picture of the light receptacle and the light switch?  or can you put back your old light fixture and see if it does the same thing?
494440,walleyejack,2010-08-14 19:30:00,358,got the pics trying to upload
494442,Terry,2010-08-14 19:38:00,14456,"figure it must look like this   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=light.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/light.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
494444,walleyejack,2010-08-14 19:44:00,358,"i think that is close. 3 cables coming in. 3 blacks together, 1 white into the other, and a single white, I m sorry i don t know how to explain it any differently, I hooked the old fixture up and it works fine, and the light switch lights up. was trying to upload pics,but that wont work for me either,  whew  sat the 14th bad day."
494445,Terry,2010-08-14 19:49:00,14456, if you hooked it up the same as the old light fixture then the new fixture is broken..wired wrong inside or burnout/shorted out
494446,walleyejack,2010-08-14 19:51:00,358,"maybe, i hooked the whites,blue together and the blacks together."
494452,Spiel,2010-08-14 20:14:00,9065,"Indispensable....  http://www.idealindu...tage_tester.jsp  I have an older home that for the most part is and has been a wiring nightmare. Without something like the above tester, for determining what is hot and what is not I never would have been able to replace any fixtures, switches or outlets.  I know that's of no help now but if you liking doing your own renos and such it's something you should aquire."
494460,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-14 20:38:00,0,  Yes...if you are hooking up a fan there certainly can be two hot wires. One for your fan and one for your lights in the fan. They do this so you can control your lights and fan separately with two switches. Hook the blue with the black in the fan first then add to the circut using Terry's diagram. Hope this helps.
