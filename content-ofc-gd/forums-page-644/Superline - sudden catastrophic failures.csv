Sometimes this happens when the line is brand new, but more often, when the line has been used for quite awhile.  Personally, I had this problem with the 30 pound Powerpro, on my casting rods, a couple of years ago.  The line was over a year old, but it still looked good.  Then suddenly it began to break between the rod and the bait when I tried to pull a lure off of a weed or snag.  At I-Cast, last month, Sufix announced a new braid called ""Sufix 832 Advanced Superline.""  The name comes from the fact that this new line is an 8 strand braid and 32 pics, or weaves, per inch.  Eight strands with such a high pic count will make this line very tight and round.  One of the 8 strands is made from Gore-Tex!?! Curious, about the supposed benefit of this Gore-Tex fibre, I did some research.  According to Sufix, when the superline fibers drawn tight, past a certain point, they start cutting themselves!  The effects shows up as a slightly fuzzy look when the line is dry.  Over time this weakens the line to the point where a sudden shock causes catastrophic failure...IE. Sudden unexpected break-offs.  According to Sufix the purpose of the Gore-Tex fibre is to lubricate their very tight weave, thus eliminating this problem.  So far I haven't seen any of this new line for sale.  Most of the new products from I-Cast will be hitting the US market in November.  If that's the case, I will give you my first impressions of it on-the-water, this winter. Garry2R's"

494324,alexcba,2010-08-14 08:19:00,634,very interesting. thanks for the heads up garrry.
494333,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-14 09:55:00,0,Sounds very promising. I've had my 50lb pwer pro for ages and no problems other then the line turning white but i still catch fish. I bought some 20 lb for slop.I hope it doesn't start breaking. The trilene mono has been giving me all kinds of problems with tangles.

494498,Garry2Rs,2010-08-14 23:12:00,1425,  I don't think it will be too pricey. I think I heard $20.00US. There are supposed to be some discount coupons available soon to help dealers clear their old stock. Garry2rs
