494832,kevinhiles,2010-08-16 03:52:00,22,I'm a newbie at fishing but I like to get out when ever I can and I'm starting to use a lot of the tips I've learned on this board.  I was fishing last weekend at a friend's cottage on Gananoque Lake - didn't have much luck. Does anyone have any tips for fishing that lake? I plan on going back in a few weeks. We have a boat - which helps.  Any help is appreciated!  Thanks
