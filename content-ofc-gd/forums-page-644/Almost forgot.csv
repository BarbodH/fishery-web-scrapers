As a young boy (not too long ago) I quickly fell in love with hiking the small creeks and rivers of Ontario in search of browns and brookies and pinning for fall and spring steelhead. I hope to gain lots of knowledge as a young fisherman, from the many wise and respected fishermen/women on this forum.   Evan."
