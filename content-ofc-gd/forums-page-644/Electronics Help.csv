Was fishing last Saturday and all was working well...came back Monday and nothing on the panel would work.  Changed the main fuse, nothing.  Took the panels off and tested that I was getting power to everywhere, all looks good.  Anyone have any ideas as to what might be my problem?  Thanks in advance!"

494602,tknohpy,2010-08-15 12:59:00,162,Can you tell me how I would go about testing the grounds?
494603,Spiel,2010-08-15 13:09:00,9065,I think a 12v continuity tester should do it.  One end to the red wire feeding the instrument panel and the other to the ground (black) wire leaving the panel. Make sure the panel power supply switch is on.

494718,aplumma,2010-08-15 20:26:00,6896,The gauges in most boats are wired positive in series so it is most likely a ground issue. Remove clean and reinstall the ground and all of the wires that go to the battery. Find the ground wire that goes to gauges and see if it has come loose at the last gauge. Clip the continuity tester to the battery ground lug and touch the power wire to the gauges if their is power the light will come on and confirms the ground is missing.   Art
