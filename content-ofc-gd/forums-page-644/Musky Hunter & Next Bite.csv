494092,mistyriver1,2010-08-13 14:11:00,600,Does anybody know why Musky Hunter and Next Bite are not on WFN anymore ?
494094,southpaw24,2010-08-13 14:13:00,32,"I thhink Musky Hunter is still on, its just late friday nights whn it airs"
494102,lew,2010-08-13 14:37:00,12766,"I was wondering the same thing Jim, I always liked  MuskyHunter but haven't seen it in quite awhile."
494111,Terry,2010-08-13 14:58:00,14456,well that explains why my pvr hasn't recorded those 2 shows lately...i like them...and the next bite may be my favorite fishing show
494125,bucktail,2010-08-13 15:38:00,1857,"I love both shows , especially next bite and the way they describe the rigging and presentation of baits."
494127,SudburyAngler,2010-08-13 15:40:00,154,"Those are both very well done shows and I was wondering the same, but my favourites are propably The new fly fisher and facts of fishing and fishn canada"
494138,muskymatt,2010-08-13 16:05:00,2608,Hmmm...so it wasn't just me.  Definitly a loss if they are not on anymore.
494139,SudburyAngler,2010-08-13 16:05:00,154,"yes sir, very good programming"
494173,alexcba,2010-08-13 18:29:00,634,"maybe the seasons over for them, perhaps the network only gave them a certain number of shows for this season. not sure how it works but that could be a good possibility. i love both shows aswell, and im pretty sure many others enjoy them aswell so i doubt they've been canceled."
494198,mbosh1980,2010-08-13 19:51:00,349,"Both shows are still listed on the website but come up as ""no episodes this week"". I would assume if they were dropped by the network they would be nowhere to be found on wfn.tv.  I have to guess they will be back once some new episodes are in the can."
494210,NAW,2010-08-13 20:29:00,4022,I hope Alexcba is right..  Two great shows for sure.  I can only take so much bass fishing eh.
494213,muskeybugged,2010-08-13 20:42:00,282,"Yeah I think they were both in their 3rd rotation of reruns for this season.  New ones come out just after the new year or so.  I hope this is the case, and I hope the return to the Monster Fish Thursday time slot fits my schedule perfect."
494290,[emailÂ protected],2010-08-14 02:11:00,25,"Ya not much of a reason to watch...and I get ""bassed"" out pretty quick.  Time for some fresh ideas fellas/ladies.  I think I could watch April Vokey on Fly Max forever"
494381,Whopper,2010-08-14 15:14:00,2174,I don't get either one of them down here unless they air them on Versus I still have a bitter taste in my crawl after EA took a three year membership fee from me and never sent me a a refund or even a letter as to why they felt the need to take my money and close down shop
494382,SudburyAngler,2010-08-14 15:17:00,154,HAHA I could watch mariko izumi forever  
494383,Terry,2010-08-14 15:17:00,14456, I see you have never seen those 2 shows the only time you will see bass is if they are using them for bait.....
494385,SudburyAngler,2010-08-14 15:19:00,154,"I have no problem with bass just it's very....repetitive and they're all pretty well the same size, now muskie and pike and the odd walleye from cronzy, thats enjoyable"
494404,chimpboy_to,2010-08-14 16:53:00,27,You can watch all of seasons 1-5 of the next bite online here: http://www.thenextbite.com/node/14472  Lots of great episodes.
494405,SudburyAngler,2010-08-14 17:12:00,154,thanks
494626,thefireman,2010-08-15 14:49:00,51,"I'm with Tommy! Mariko all the way! In the tropical locations though, as she always had the bikini on!lol"
