493549,ehg,2010-08-11 15:10:00,2666,"Last night i saw a couple of very bright shooting stars, right here in downtown Toronto. The Perseid meteor shower is starting. The peak is to be around 4-5 am(lew o'clock) Friday. Anytime it is dark and clear the next few days it is worth a look. Especially away from city lights. Just a heads up! Cheers"
493553,bulltron,2010-08-11 15:21:00,88,"thanks for the heads up!!  going up to my cottage at lake nepewassi today for 5 days, will defn' be lightless! hope i get to see some!"
493556,lew,2010-08-11 15:36:00,12766,A group of us were at a cottage on the West Arm of Nippissing last August during the meteor shower and it was great sitting outside in near total darkness watching it.  Fantastic show of Mother Nature at her finest.  We're heading back up there again this Saturday but may not see it this year because of the date and also the clouds and rain their predicting.  Definetely worth watching if anyone has the chance !!
493558,bdox,2010-08-11 15:40:00,329,"I should be on the 401 heading east to Quinte at that time, hopefully will make for a interesting drive and not to much of a distraction."
493563,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-11 15:49:00,932,"Thanks for the heads up EHG!  Last year I was driving and saw a crazy meteor shower in Kitchener-Waterloo - it was spectacular.  At first we thought it was a plane crashing as everything that was falling was on fire - very intense.  Hope to see something like it again.  Cheers, Ryan"
493564,ehg,2010-08-11 15:51:00,2666," If you are outside and it is clear next couple of days Lew, you should see the meteors where you are. Saw some last night, in the city here, after dusk even."
493711,ehg,2010-08-12 00:28:00,2666,bump... lots of shooting stars next few nights

493732,Joey,2010-08-12 01:47:00,9122,"Well I just read up on my new camera for the last couple of hours and changed all my settings to possibly get a few pics or videos of the shower, but alas it is overcast.  Maybe tomorrow night!"
493774,lew,2010-08-12 08:48:00,12766,"Cloudy here this morning so nothing visible. Oh well, maybe it'll clear up for tonight.....hopefully."

493970,Raycaster,2010-08-13 01:41:00,528," LEW, heads up. Don't worry about the Meteor Showers, go get the lunker we missed a few weeks ago around Pine Creek! All we caught were baby pikes and a 26"" but a VERY big boy came up to the boat in 4' of water...It sat beside the boat and stared at every lure and figure 8 we could show it. It got bored and went right over to our other boat to tease them too. Couldn't believe 2 separate boats saw it over 50 feet apart..."
494017,Nemo,2010-08-13 04:38:00,727,Just saw a couple of meteors while sitting in my back yard.  Let me know if you see any.  Got work tomorrow so have to pack it in.
494023,Sinker,2010-08-13 05:46:00,8692,"Pretty decent show in this neck of the woods. Watched it from the water for about an hour, then the ride home.  S."
494026,lew,2010-08-13 08:58:00,12766,"Very dark here with clear skies this morning so I took my coffee out to the back deck about 3:45 and sat for the next hour watching the light show and it was well worth it.  I counted 41 meteors, 5 satellites and 1 bat  Great way to start the day"
494030,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-13 11:01:00,2582,Heading for the cottage tonight. Is this going to be going on tonight...Friday... as well? I'll make sure I am down at my fav bridge to get a good view.
494046,cram,2010-08-13 11:59:00,1733," 41 meteors!  sad that i missed it.  what time do you go to bed, Lew?"
494160,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-13 17:20:00,0,I counted 25 in an hour just passed 1am down here in the city. Was somewhat hazy but there was no mistaking them when they went by. Was nice to see.
494618,danbouck,2010-08-15 14:02:00,4380,"I had no idea this was going on and we were in Restoule. Friday night my boy and I were looking at the stars and saw them non stop, it was Awesome!"
494623,Cudz,2010-08-15 14:21:00,2652,Me too.  Spent most nights sitting on a big rock at cottage watching them flying all over the place.  Must have seen over 20 one night.
