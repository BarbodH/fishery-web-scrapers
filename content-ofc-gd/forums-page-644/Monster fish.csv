494713,kickingfrog,2010-08-15 20:15:00,8333,Night fishin' a river in the Amazon inhabited by pirana would make me think EVERYTHING was a monster.

494780,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-16 01:05:00,932,I had the pleasure of taking in the Gar episode and some of the Amazon episode.  I hope to watch all of them in the near future - they are great shows.
494843,spincast,2010-08-16 09:20:00,3279,those are sime seriously big fish. The one guy said the biggest he caught was over 7 ft and 260 lbs! They do charters for them too - take alook at these snaps: Texas Fishing charter too bad its so far away - not exactly a weekend trip...  
494844,OhioFisherman,2010-08-16 09:20:00,6623,"N/G has some good programs, watched a couple last week. Studies of the cause of dropping water levels in the upper Great Lakes. 6500 year old tree stumps in 40 feet of water in Lake Huron? Glaciers compacted the ground by the shear weight of the ice? and it is still rebounding? Heck I thought I moved slow!  Building the new Camaro at the Oshwa and St. Catherine`s GM plants. The CA in Camaro must mean Canada?"
494902,SudburyAngler,2010-08-16 14:32:00,154,I'd love to hook into a gar
