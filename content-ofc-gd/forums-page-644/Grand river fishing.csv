493602,Lunatic,2010-08-11 17:27:00,536,they were removed so cooler heads would prevail
493605,tb4me,2010-08-11 17:35:00,3295,Oh Thank-god I thought I was going crazy for a minute there...yikes!
493663,Musky or Specks,2010-08-11 21:55:00,2710,Its not that I'm a non believer in the Grand I'm more agnostic. I have faith that there are big fish in there. I just don't go after any particular one.
493666,purekgw,2010-08-11 22:02:00,585,"the grand dosnt have any fish at all dont waste your time or gas to drive out here, no point"
493668,toca,2010-08-11 22:06:00,274,thanks for the tip
493672,smally21,2010-08-11 22:34:00,993,the grand use to have a walleye and a sheephead.  now you've caught the walleye.....
493698,vinnimon,2010-08-11 23:56:00,2593," The sheephead,high tailed it right out of the grand! Lost his buddy and ran away! Flipped me the fin on his way out! So YEP!!! NO FISH IN THE GRAND!"
493843,lookinforwalleye,2010-08-12 17:21:00,4399,"You are not allowed to post fishing location on this site, someone might try and fish there!!!"
493861,tb4me,2010-08-12 18:41:00,3295,Heaven forbid somone fishes where I did...as I said earlier access is by either canoe or my Grnadfathers land..Good luck with the latter of the 2.
493865,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-12 18:56:00,932," Man, don't get all fired up.  Just don't name specific spots - it is against the rules of this forum - this is why your post was edited and my posts were removed (to stop the flame war and post closure that would have surely ensued).  Consider it a lesson for the future and let it die now.  For all you know, that ""spot"" is 4-5 other members of this board who have gone to great lengths to keep it quiet - that's the heart of the rule - it is designed to protect the fishery, because newsflash, word of fishing spots travel quickly and they don't remain good spots for long after that.  (And FYI - the Grand is a navigable waterway, your Grandfather's land isn't ""untouchable"" so your argumentative tone is misplaced)"
493889,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-12 20:17:00,0,"Great Report. That pickerel looks mighty tasty! Enjoy! I too used to post detailed info and got alot of complaint email.lol Some people are very protective when it comes to their fishing grounds. Especially when it is a small area and can easily become overwhelmed and outfished by fishermen.  Didn't read the initial report, but thanks for sharing. The Grand has one of the best eco systems in North America and will provide great fishing for many years to come."
493964,lookinforwalleye,2010-08-13 01:19:00,4399,  Just in case you did not realize my tongue was firmly planted in my cheek!!
494391,oates,2010-08-14 15:40:00,151,"Lower Grand has been slow for me this year. Funny, last year was cold and wet but Bass where jumping, this year is hot and supposedly bass weather and its slow. I can't find walleye in the grand (where I wade) so maybe in Sept. when things cool down. Fished 5hrs yesterday, hooked in to two decent size bass but not another bite, strange."
494451,fishinguypat,2010-08-14 20:06:00,547,Stay out of the Grand... there are no fish
494453,SudburyAngler,2010-08-14 20:16:00,154,good report
494550,sauce,2010-08-15 03:01:00,219,"The grand is awesome. Glad to hear you had a good day. I grew up shore fishing this river. Good times. I bought a boat and forgot about the awesome fishing available within walking distance. Last summer I got back into shore fishing and had some great days myself. The river is loaded with fish. All you have to do is find an access point and get in the water. If you walk more than 500m and don't catch a bass you are doing something wrong. Man, the number of 16"" plus bass that I've caught near my house is unreal. And I've caught 20s down there too. Just not as many."
