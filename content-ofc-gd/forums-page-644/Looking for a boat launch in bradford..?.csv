Possibly thinking I may like to fish the mouth of the holland marsh river..possibly killarney bay?? I live in toronto, so ideally, any launch in simcoe which would be closest to toronto would be the greatest....I'm heading out with a few ppl who would be looking for the least amount of commuting...    Any suggestions would be great  thank you!  -Mark"
