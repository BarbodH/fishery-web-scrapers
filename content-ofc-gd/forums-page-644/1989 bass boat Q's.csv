It has a 70hp merc. the only info i have gotten is that malibu makes a good wake board boat. lol"

While it is nice that it has new support parts trailer, batteries, trolling motor etc how is the other components as far as wear? Is the steering free? does the electrics all work? Most importantly if the motor goes bad is it worth putting a new motor on? Check over the hull for gouges and soft spots they can be a major factor if the boat was stored outside even covered. I picked up a 1989 Ranger with a 150 gt that was garage kept and had no dings or even a scum line here in the States for $1200.00 so the deals are out their. Finally if he is a buddy and the deal goes bad will it affect your friendship??? Ask for a day of fishing were you will pay for everything so you can see it in action might be a good starting point. Then a trip to the mechanic for a motor evaluation will go far in being pleased with the great deal.   Art"

494737,Garry2Rs,2010-08-15 22:00:00,1425,"Malibu isn't a name brand. If it's what I think it is, it's under 16 feet long and an old tri-hull design. In spite of the new parts, it's not a very desirable boat at any price."
