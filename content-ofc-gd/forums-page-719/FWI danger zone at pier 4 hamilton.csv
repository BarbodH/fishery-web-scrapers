438988,vinnimon,2010-03-02 20:59:00,2593,I was out on sunday and I was warned about some huge hole that was cut by someone.And not a fisherman.A local in the area told me that some idiots did this for a joke.Mind you I didnt see the hole first hand but I figured Id pass it along to you guys who plan on fishing the area just in case.With these warm temps it may be very dangerous at the 15 to 25 fow areas.In the boat ramp area this morning it looked fine to me.But dont qoute me on it.Just an FWI and what I was warned about by the locals on sunday.For Gods sake be careful out there.
