437942,Terry,2010-02-28 00:25:00,14456,yeah yours was a little loose in my hole.............what did I just say.....dang...lets try again  the pin you lent me was too skinny for the towbar hole..that sounds better...but it worked well thanks I will check it out
437944,irishfield,2010-02-28 00:27:00,26272,Like throwing a hot dog down a hallway...
