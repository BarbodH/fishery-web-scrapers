439763,ehg,2010-03-04 18:14:00,2666,Nice fish! First picture of a spring rainbow i have seen this year. Some of these spring runners must be around the estuaries/mouths of the Lake O tributaries now as well.
439766,Dozer,2010-03-04 18:18:00,896,Is that a spring run fish?    I don't know much about color change in the fish and how fast it happens but those black specs on top of the fish are used for camoflauge in the river.  Experts chime in please?
