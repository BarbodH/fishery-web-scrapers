439445,Syn,2010-03-03 23:54:00,519,"I want to tie a few 6-8"" perch flies with a 4/0 5/0 hook Some thing like this with a large size profile http://www.uksaltwaterflies.com/acatalog/a...gbunkerfly.html  The material in question is ""Moss hair body"" material.  http://i.imgur.com/lXAJa.jpg   Can I use moss hair or will it be too stiff to create a lifelike undulating body in the water. Like this:  Should I be using ""Angel Hair/silk"" type hack instead?    Edit: I've been doing more ""homework"" about the materials and I've found out the Moss hair above probably is not hydrophobic  and the angel hair is not really meant to hold a large vertical shape for a Puglisi type fly although you can use the angel hair to highlight the fly.  Right now I'm researching between  Enrico Puglisi EP Fibers VS Congo hair. Yes Ep would be my first choice but its more than 3X the price of congo hair  on the upside I was reading a fishing post and it ended with ""P.S. The wife was at work when the package was delivered.  ""  ,which made me chuckle heartily.  Edit2: Found nice detailed HD videos for a EP Bait Fish variant (really awesome)  http://flyartstudio.com/wordpress/?p=634"
