Trade Carry Price before his career gets ruined.  Ive noticed that he gets bullied in his own net by the opposition with no payback.  Lets face it, their European type hockey hasn't worked in over a decade.  The following is a list that must be traded, unless they trade all of them as a package, they ain't getting nothing.  Yea I know Plekanec is having a career season, but he only plays when its not rough.  52  Mathieu Darche    6' 1"" 215 26 Nov 1976 33 Montreal, QC, CAN 46  Andrei Kosteatsyn    6' 0"" 214 3 Feb 1985 25 Novopolotsk, BLR 74  Sergei Kosteatsyn    6' 0"" 210 20 Mar 1987 22 Novopolotsk, BLR 40  Maxim Lapierre    6' 2"" 207 29 Mar 1985 24 Saint-Léonard, QC, CAN 15  Glen Metropolit    5' 10"" 196 25 Jun 1974 35 Toronto, ON, CAN 14  Tomas Plekanec    5' 11"" 198 31 Oct 1982 27 Kladno, CZE 94  Tom Pyatt    5' 11"" 187 14 Feb 1987 23 Thunder Bay, ON, CAN 47  Marc-Andre Bergeron   **  5' 9"" 198 13 Oct 1980 29 Trois-Rivières, QC, CAN 44  Roman Hamrlik    6' 2"" 207 12 Apr 1974 35 Zlin, CZE 6  Jaroslav Spacek    6' 0"" 210 11 Feb 1974 36 Rokycany, CZE 31  Carey Price    6' 3"" 219 16 Aug 1987 22 Anahim Lake, BC, CAN"
439205,Lunatic,2010-03-03 07:47:00,536,"moving finger will be almost impossible. his contract is disgusting,burry him in the minors.  i really hope/wish they move grabovski. i cant stand his play and he gets thrown out of the face-off circle more then anybody. the summer free agents are terrible this year,and we only have 1 chip to use for trades in the summer(kabrele,and he is a ufa) so i dont expect a great team next season either."
439228,kickingfrog,2010-03-03 13:14:00,8333,"Considering his poor performance in the Olympics, I'm sure Pittsburgh will be trying to move 87. They might get a late 1st rounder for him."
