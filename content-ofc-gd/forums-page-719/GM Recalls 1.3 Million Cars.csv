GENERAL MOTORS RECALLS 1.3 MILLION VEHICLES  DETROIT (AP)  General Motors has announced it will recall 1.3 million cars across North America over a potentially faulty power steering motor following a federal probe into the problem in January.  The recall would cover 2005- through 2010-model year Chevrolet Cobalts and 2007-2010 Pontiac G5s, along with similar models in Canada and Mexico, the U.S. automaker said in a statement. Complaints had been filed about power steering failures that could make the vehicles difficult to control.  ""After our in-depth investigation, we found that this is a condition that takes time to develop. It tends to occur in older models out of warranty,"" GM vice president of quality Jamie Hresko said in the statement.  ""Recalling these vehicles is the right thing to do for our customers' peace of mind,"" he added.  The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a probe of 905,000 Chevrolet Cobalts earlier this year after receiving more than 1,100 consumer complaints, which included reports of 14 crashes and one injury."

438939,jediangler,2010-03-02 17:43:00,1923,"Two of my buddies bought new cars last year. One bought a Cobalt and the other bought a Corolla. The Cobalt owner has been razzing the Corolla owner to no end over the last few months. Now the shoe is on the other foot, so to speak."
438942,SBCregal,2010-03-02 17:51:00,688,this recall will probably fix the problem though
438944,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-02 18:10:00,4399,"I also heard this morning that Toyota is not recalling 1.6 million vehicles for an oil hose problem that could cause engine failure. The guys at Toyota are quick learners, they are calling this non-recall a service advisory.LOL"

438986,Jer,2010-03-02 20:54:00,1426,  Probably because no one has or probably will be killed by this defect...
439017,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-02 22:43:00,10439," The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a probe of 905,000 Chevrolet Cobalts earlier this year after receiving more than 1,100 consumer complaints, which included reports of 14 crashes and one injury.  Just a matter of time."
439052,bucktail,2010-03-03 00:37:00,1857,"Still wont go to hearings since the US goverment is in fact the major stock holder in the company now. If you thinnk the Toyota bashing is because of the defect your pretty gullible. its simply a chance to try to knock down Toyota sales and increase Gm sales by the goverment. this whole thing is as dirty as a 3 day old diaper!  ""Probably because no one has or probably will be killed by this defect...""  ""Complaints had been filed about power steering failures that could make the vehicles difficult to control.""   Yea a loss of steering control will probably never result in accidents."

439206,west lake charlie,2010-03-03 07:55:00,40,This is worth a read to anybody who is busy toyota bashing.  http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/cont...0225_403524.htm
439211,Jer,2010-03-03 11:31:00,1426,"  If you can't control your car when the power steering fails, you probably shouldn't be driving. What do you think happens when your engine unexpectedly stalls? Seems preferrable to unexpected acceleration anyday."
439221,holdfast,2010-03-03 12:46:00,1813,"sure, youve convinced me they are safer.  Like some one mentioned, I doubt there will be a senate hearing.  never was for the exploding gas tanks upon impact either."
439240,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-03 14:17:00,4399,"  Yes all this is smoke and mirror`s just to bring Toyota down,sure it is!!!  Damn floor mats."
