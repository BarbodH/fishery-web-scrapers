439044,archer379,2010-03-03 00:11:00,277,I was up at bass pro on the weekend and was looking at the new  carbonlite rods and reels was just wondering if anyone has had a look at them and whats your opinon of it?
439053,redneck666,2010-03-03 00:39:00,563,LOL! I asked the EXACT same question not too long ago...  no one answered me....
439065,Cudz,2010-03-03 00:50:00,2652,I like the rods.  Very light.  Reals are very light too but they feel kind of cheap (probably because they are light)
439071,archer379,2010-03-03 00:59:00,277,  what did you think of it
439074,redneck666,2010-03-03 01:01:00,563,"havent even layed a finger on one yet. im no wheres close to a bass pro shops. i gotta go all the way to traverse city in michigan to see one...... i wouldnt mind goin there though, seems like theres lots to do there."
439099,archie_james_c,2010-03-03 01:41:00,618,Seems to me Cabelas and Bass Pro's house brand looks to be rebranded chinese crap. I shouldn't say that all Chinese stuff is crap. But 99-109$ USD for an IM9 graphite rod isn't a bad deal at all.  Personally I'd save up for a Loomis GL2 rod or a Croix Avid.
439143,perchslayer666,2010-03-03 03:02:00,280,"   Huh? Have you even picked up a Bass Pro reel or rod? I'll agree with you for the lower end BPS stuff, but the ""higher"" end stuff is just as good as St. Croix or G Loomis stuff (same cost)  I was in BPS today and picked up a Johnny Morris Elite signature rod, and it feels and looks like a $210 rod, with more features than a comparable Shimano/Loomis/St. Croix ect.... They make great stuff, just look at the higher end stuff and you'll be pleasantly surprised."
439144,salmon,2010-03-03 03:04:00,334,"I picked up two of the Carbonlites several weeks ago. One 7 Ft casting and spinning model I was in the market for another St. Croix Avid or a G. Loomis Mossyback. I figured for less than $95 , why not. I was impressed and the lightest rod I held. Even though I am not a big fan of the split grips these felt really nice. Only one problem, I asked about the warranty and it was only a one year warranty on them.  Jose"
439148,archie_james_c,2010-03-03 03:10:00,618,  Yah...an 85 million modulus blank with REC's for 160$....theres nothing suspicous about that....   Buy Loomis or Croix...support companies that hand build rods in North America and stand behind a LIFETIME warranty....  Or...buy a BPS...
439209,singingdog,2010-03-03 11:22:00,1047,"I only have second-hand info. Lots of folks down south have been fishing the carbonlites since they came out. The consensus seems to be that it is the new Compre: lots of performance in a very reasonably priced rod. The warranty doesn't stack up against other companies very well, but the rods are getting good reviews."
