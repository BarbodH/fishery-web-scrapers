439146,vinnimon,2010-03-03 03:06:00,2593,"MY favorite recipe when camping.  1. A good hot fire pit. 2. A fillet of choice freshly caught. 3. depending on the size of the fillet,dice it up in cubes,about 1/2 -1/4""cubes,I prefer pickerel 4. 1 can of cream of brocoli or whatever of your choice as long its its cream of something 5. slowly cook the cubed fillets and cream of brocoli/califlour over the hot coals to desired richness 6. Eat till your hearts content.  We did this in Bruce National Park with a fresh 12lb pickerel I caught 1/2hr before.We were hungary and only brought up canned food to make it easier for use.Man that was some awesome meal.  The turtle recipe is surely a dinger.I may try it out one day to freek out my kids  .  BTW in most contest,arent family and employees excluded?"
439208,Big Cliff,2010-03-03 10:32:00,6899," Glad to share it Joe, you won't find it in any cook books, it took me a couple of years to perfect it.  I'd have shared my French Onion soup recipe too but I use dehydrated puffball mushrooms in it and I don't think you can find them in any store, I always dehydrate one or two every fall when I get them. You'll just have to make a side trip when you come up this summer, I'll give you some to take home with you and the recipe!"

Here is Grilled Chicken and Vegetable Fajitas  Pics here: http://www.mykitchenaddiction.com/2009/08/...etable-fajitas/  ""Grilled Chicken and Vegetable Fajitas  * 1 packet Amazing Taste Fajita Seasoning * 1 pound chicken breast tenders * 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided * 2 small bell peppers, cut into 2 inch slices (I had one green and one purple from the garden) * 1 small yellow squash, cut in half lengthwise an then sliced * 1 small onion, sliced * 4 ounces baby portabella mushrooms, sliced * 1/2 lime * Flour tortillas * Fresh salsa (optional) * Sour cream (optional) * Fresh cilantro (optional) * Lime slices/wedges (optional)  Preheat the grill to medium heat.  Combine one tablespoon of the seasoning and one tablespoon of olive oil in a bowl. Add the chicken breast tenders and toss to coat with the seasoning and oil. Cover and refrigerate while preparing the vegetables.  Slice all of the vegetables and place in a large bowl. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, the rest of the seasoning packet, and the juice from the lime half.  Toss to evenly coat all of the vegetables.  Transfer the vegetables to a grill basket and cook on the grill, stirring occasionally, for about 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the chicken on the grill, cooking for about 8-10 minutes, turning once.  Transfer the vegetables to a platter, and top with the grilled chicken tenders.  Garnish with fresh cilantro and lime slices, if desired. Serve immediately with flour tortillas, salsa, sour cream, and all of your favorite taco/fajita toppings!""

437981,danbouck,2010-02-28 02:36:00,4380,"Well this is something that I kind of made up one morning.  Take 1 package of egg whites and pour them into an egg poacher    Start cooking the eggs and when they start to harden around the outside toss in cut up onion, peppers, mushrooms and a small chunk of low fat cheese.  Cook until the egg is good and solid. Toss on a plate and serve with 2 slices of whole wheat toast.  When you sink your fork into it. it's like a lava cake of cheese  This has saved me while dieting. It tastes better then any breakfast I've had and it has only about 200cal, 5g of fat and about 30g of protein."

438945,Leecher,2010-03-02 18:18:00,7832,"Leechman's chateaubriand steak.  This recipe I make every week during the winter and it's pretty good. Ingredients you'll need:  3 Chateaubriand steaks, 1 oignon, a couple branches of celery, half sweet pepper red all grossly chopped, one small packet of Bovril beef flavour, 1/3 cup of warm water.  Dilute the bovril into 1/3 cup of warm water and set aside.  Preheat a pan on high and after a minute, drop a chunk of butter.  You should hear the butter sizzle while it's melting.  When completely melted, add the steaks in the pan and sear each side.  Don't over do it.  The middle should be rare at this point.  Move the steaks into an oven casserole or corning ware container and preheat the oven at 200 degrees.  Add / spread the oignons, celery and peppers around the steaks.  Pour the bovril on top of the steaks and vegetables, salt and pepper to taste.  Cover with foil and into the oven for 1 hour and a half.  Serve with mash potatoes or rice if you like and Cesar salad. Enjoy Leechman"

439012,Big Cliff,2010-03-02 22:21:00,6899,"Cliff's Cream of roasted garlic seafood chouder.  Ingredients:  5 garlic Bulbs 4 Tbsp Olive Oil (a little more won't hurt) 2 1/2 cups chicken broth 1 cup white wine (and a glass for you while you are cooking) 2 1/2 cups of milk 1 cup heavy whipping cream 1/2 cup peeled and cubed potatoes 1 1/2 cups salad shrimp (but you can use clams, scallops or almost any fish cut into small pieces or any combination of above) (you can leave the fish out if you just want to serve this as a soup) salt and pepper to taste  Cut about 1/4"" off the top of the garlic bulbs and place them cut side up in a shallow roasting pan, drizzle olive oil over the cut area and bake in a pre heated 350° oven for 1 hour. Cool slightly then press individual garlic cloves between thumb and finger squeezing the garlic out.  In a sauce pan, combine garlic, chicken stock, and white wine, simmer on low heat for 30 minutes.  Stir in the milk, cream, and potatoes and simmer for an additional 30 minutes.  Puree the soup/chowder in a blender then return to the sauce pan.  Now I usually take the bits of raw garlic that came out of the top of the bulbs and add it to the mixture at this point then add the shrimp or whatever else I am using. Add your salt and pepper, reheat and serve with a garnish of grated cheese or parsley.  I may not win the prize but I will promise you one thing, if you do make this, your whole house smell warm and sweet, and your guests will love it.  Oh, and if I could, I would serve it with some of Bruce's fantastic home made bread on the side.  (now you know why I'm BIG CLIFF LOL.)"

Take note though that the bulbs of garlic is the WHOLE bulb....5 of them not just 5 cloves.  You'll love this stuff and serve it to everyone.

439069,dheitzner,2010-03-03 00:55:00,314,"Hey Art, I'd love to be included in the draw, great idea! This is Gord Pyzer's recipe, originally published in In-Fisherman a number of years ago. It is not for the faint of heart or those who don't like spicy food (Gord says it will make a Swede sweat bullets), but it may be my favorite fish recipe of all time.  -1.5lbs fish fillets, cut into 1"" cubes (whitefish, perch, walleye and pike are all excellent, I've also used tillapia) -3 or 4 strips of bacon, diced -2 cloves of garlic, crushed -2tbsp onion, chopped -2 sticks of butter (I use way less, in the neighborhood of 2 or 3 oz) -2tsp cayenne pepper -1.5tsp dijon mustard -1/4 tsp basil -1/4tsp thyme -1/2tsp oregano -5 squirts Tobasco sauce -2tsp fish boil seasoning (I rarely use)  Preheat oven to 375deg F. Sautee the bacon, garlic and onion in a skillet until the onion is translucent. Add butter, mustard, cayenne, basil, thyme, oregano, Tobasco and fish boil, and simmer 3 minutes. Add fish, stir and simmer another 3 minutes. Transfer to a baking dish and bake in 375deg F oven for 20 minutes.  I usually serve with rice.  As stated, this is quite a spicy dish; if you can't handle the heat, reduce the cayenne.  Darcy "
