439336,ch312,2010-03-03 18:38:00,1590,"thanks guys, have it back to normal now.   vinnimon, we only managed a couple dozen perch after a whole day of fishing. literally the worst trip to simcoe i have ever had and a couple buddies thought i was joking when i shared our results for the day. im guessing it was the nasty weather that turned them off.   we will be back up there friday. but this time im taking the ATV, borrowing a power auger, and ill be testing out the clam yukon TC that i just picked up yesterday. we shall be fishing in style now"
