438971,ketchenany,2010-03-02 19:29:00,3229,"Ottawa River ice mishap leaves man missing  1 hour, 51 minutes ago  Police were at the Ottawa River near Petrie Island Tuesday, trying to decide whether to resume the search for a man believed to have drowned after his truck broke through the ice.  The man had been towing a fishing hut across the ice when it broke beneath him around 7:30 p.m. Monday in the city's east end, near Trim Road.  The Ottawa fire department's water rescue team and Ottawa police dive team searched late into the night, but were unsuccessful at finding the man.  On Tuesday, the green roof of the truck could be seen poking out of the ice.  The missing man has been identified as Jocelyn Bélanger by friends waiting at the river Tuesday morning for the search to resume.  Relatives also waiting in the area declined to speak to CBC News.  Friends said Bélanger, known as Peewee because of his small stature, was a well-known member of the tight-knit community of people who ice fish in the area. Many of them said he was in his 40s and was originally from Sudbury, Ont.  Réjean Avon, who had known Bélanger for about five years, said he was very experienced and usually knew when the ice was safe.  ""The gentleman is from up north. He's done this thing his whole life ... I can't understand why he would have ventured like that,"" Avon said.  Those who fished with Bélanger said it was the lure of a fancy new fishing hut sitting beyond the safety of the bay at Petrie Island. The hut was sitting out in the open river, where currents quickly erode ice.  Avon says the owner abandoned the hut and told Bélanger he could have it if he could recover it.  ""It's ... maybe $1,500 worth of wood,"" Avon said. He added that those who ice fish are mindful of the dangers, and had been discussing them recently. ""Mother Nature is Mother Nature. If you respect Mother Nature, it'll respect you. If not, it'll come back to bite you.""  A provincial law requires all huts to be off the ice by March 15. But this year, temperatures have been unusually mild. Most people removed their ice-fishing huts a week ago and said they had noticed the ice was becoming too unstable to support the weight of a truck. However, some of the larger huts can only be removed with the help of a vehicle.  Yves Grandmaitre, who owns the Petrie Island Bait and Tackle Shop, said Bélanger will be mourned by the local ice fishing community. He hopes the death will increase awareness about ice safety on the river.  Several vehicles have gone through the river's ice in the past month, and seven people have required rescues in the past week, the City of Ottawa reported Tuesday."

Nobody ever wants to go through this, but the article stated several vehicles have gone through lately, so I have to wonder what kind of wake-up call does it take, to keep people off the ice with a vehicle? It will be happening soon enough on other lakes in our area, as well. Once the calendar flips the page to March, all bets are off, regarding safety on the ice, especially with a vehicle."
