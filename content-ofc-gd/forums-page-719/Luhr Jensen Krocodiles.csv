439111,Eazy,2010-03-03 02:09:00,260,"Hi all, just wondering if any fellow anglers out there have ever given these spoons a whirl, they seem to be very versatile, caught my pesonal best speckie while trolling with one of these in the spring of the year.."
439127,pike slayer,2010-03-03 02:36:00,1177,that is a very nice speckie you have on your wall!! a true trophy. havent given them an honest go
439129,solopaddler,2010-03-03 02:39:00,8605,"My favourite pier spoon for browns and bows, love 'em."
439133,Burtess,2010-03-03 02:49:00,901, Yup.... I use the hammered silver / orange stripe VERY often....  Burt
439150,archie_james_c,2010-03-03 03:13:00,618,  YES!!! I have the location AND the lure you used to catch that dinosaur!! MUAH HAHAHAHA
439164,Twocoda,2010-03-03 03:52:00,4130,  yeah smooth gold/orange strip single hook trolling and in the early river run....salmon love them...
439167,CLofchik,2010-03-03 03:57:00,854,"Great lures if there's any smelt around, I'm not a fan of the newfangled VMC hooks on them though."
439212,dave524,2010-03-03 11:42:00,4508,"They're good, rate them just below EGB's and the Delfin Alligators ( silver plate / red stripe) for specs."
439251,pikeie,2010-03-03 14:58:00,380,"I use them for pretty much anything lol... cast them for salmon, and rainbows, cast or troll them with a plastic grub added to the single hook and they slay pike. Or i even jig them under the ice! the pike love um!... o ya orange stripe or all orange!!"
439252,Harrison,2010-03-03 15:04:00,2202," Agreed, can almost hit NY from the Eastern trib peirs with the krocs."
439253,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-03 15:04:00,2690,Now THAT is/was a spoon...still have a couple...nothing caught more bows off the piers in the old days!
439260,troutologist,2010-03-03 15:23:00,951,"The hammered Kroc, in brass with an orange stripe seems to mimic a red sided dace quite well.  Lakers in certain Algoma district lakes suggest they like this resemblance."
439263,Spiel,2010-03-03 15:34:00,9065,I still have a handful of 30 year old Krocs that I take pier fishing with me.  
439268,Burtess,2010-03-03 15:42:00,901,I just Googled the Luhr Jensen Krocodile and the Gibbs Croc......  Looks like I mostly use the Gibbs Croc (as most of the ones in Spiel's pic)....  which one is preferred????  Burt
439269,mark02,2010-03-03 15:43:00,27,"The regular Krocodile is OK but I prefer the Krocodile Stubby.  At one time, Luhr Jensen called the Stubby the Little Jewel.  It's imilar to the Little Cleo but deeper cupped like the Delfin Aligator.  2/5 oz. is a good all around size; 3/4 for salmon.  The 1/3 oz. chartreuse/orange-fire-dot Little Jewel was magic for Lake Ontario browns in the days before zebra mussels.  PS Call ACME and request the return of topless Cleo on the back of the lure.  The engraved headlights were like a beacon calling out to fish."
439270,highdrifter,2010-03-03 15:43:00,2534,As I recall Gibbs also makes a croc spoon almost identical to Luhr Jensen...  I use the 1/2oz all the time.  Many a northern have fallen for em over the years!  Chris that red spoon with the black dots is a Gibbs if I'm not mistaken.  cheers HD
439301,Spiel,2010-03-03 17:06:00,9065,"   Well I had to check (I thought a few were Gibbs), but stamped on the back of every one of those spoons it says ""Krocodile-Luhr Jensen""."
439355,CLofchik,2010-03-03 19:50:00,854," Spiel's look like mostly Luhr-Jenson Kroc's, they're narrower but thicker made out of solid brass. I prefer them over Gibbs, and everybody knows the killer spring colour is solid Firetruck Red with pearl holo tape"
439384,ScugogBoy,2010-03-03 20:39:00,36,"I used the 2"" silver with brown sides on Little Lake up in Barrie almost 25 years ago and could not keep the ""hammerhandle pike"" off the lure.....slow troll gave it the best action."
439640,singingdog,2010-03-04 12:25:00,1047,Krocs and Little Cleos are almost all I throw. The Kroc comes in a killer rainbow pattern that works well in this area.
439768,ehg,2010-03-04 18:19:00,2666,   They sound productive if these seasoned anglers give them the thumbs up.
