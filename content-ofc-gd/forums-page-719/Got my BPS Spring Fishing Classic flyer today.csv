438836,Cudz,2010-03-02 04:34:00,2652,Nothing that really makes me want to run there and be the first in line.  Would have liked to see more deals.  I will still go to the sale as I have a nice little $50 BPS card that needs to be emptied.
438860,Jer,2010-03-02 11:43:00,1426,Is it available on-line?
438863,Syn,2010-03-02 12:22:00,519,It might show up here in the next few days http://toronto.flyerland.ca/bass-pro-shops/110/flyer/17250
438883,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-02 13:33:00,2690,"Need to take the ""old man"" out there during that, got him a card for his b-day...usually only make one trip a year since I discovered Angling Outfitters.  Still love going though, always spend a couple hours wandering through ""tackle heaven!"" Any deals on ice fishing equipment?"
438916,bucktail,2010-03-02 16:23:00,1857,Maybe I own too much but I found I wasnt alll that thrilled in the deals. There is however 40% off spinner rig components which I will use on Erie this year and 20% off Loomis rods.
438922,CLofchik,2010-03-02 16:43:00,854,Anybody have an idea what the daily specials are going to be other than the first two days?
439018,uglyfish,2010-03-02 22:45:00,981,i agree... not a whole lot that really gets me excited. theres a few things that might be good to grab or stock up on. the only reason ill be goin is the 75 bucks worth of gift cards i have and the reel trade in. ill be getting a new reel for about 85 bucks once all is said and done. not bad for a 200 dollar reel! lol
