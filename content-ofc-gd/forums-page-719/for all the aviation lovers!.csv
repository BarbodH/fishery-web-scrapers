439620,pikehunter,2010-03-04 10:51:00,1659,Great!   Isn't it enough the we have to deal with clowns on seadoos buzzing us while fishing? Now maybe someday we will be getting buzzed on the water and from the air all at the same time. Pretty   idea though and I too was also hoping the girl was part of the deal.
439626,hammercarp,2010-03-04 11:35:00,964,Those hoover craft are unbelievably noisey.You can hear them miles away on a lake. They're absolutely great at ruining a nice quiet morning. They are as annoying as seadoos while putting out ear bleeding decibels.
