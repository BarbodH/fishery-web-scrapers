439437,Syn,2010-03-03 23:26:00,519,"  Sure you can find it in store but the ASP is a grey item. I can go downtown and buy brass knuckles (prohibited) even seen them in store windows in the past. Since its not a spring loaded baton you can buy it legally, but many reputable security stores that sell batons ask for ID, security lic and proof you took the baton course or they won't sell you it.  The baton you have is not prohibited because its not spring loaded, so they can sell it legally.  ""13. The device commonly known as a “Kiyoga Baton” or “Steel Cobra” and any similar device consisting of a manually triggered telescoping spring-loaded steel whip terminated in a heavy calibre striking tip."" http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/sor-...sor-98-462.html  BUT  all it takes is a person seeing you with it (while walking your dog), who calls the cops and you can get yourself in trouble quickly. For example: If the police want to they can charge you with carrying a concealed weapon. Now you may go to court and get acquitted but you would have spent your time and money with a lawyer if you aren't one.  Because you live far away from Toronto and the many crazy people we have here probably those you see while walking your dog and know you wouldn't bother you, knowing you carry a baton. I'd bet the local police would not even bother you about it. But sometimes all it takes is a cop in bad mood to find yourself arrested then the'll just drop the charges later after you've been stressing out for a few weeks.  Yes I carried a baton only after taking the baton course and only during work. We were told if you pull that baton out at work for example to threaten teenagers to leave (bad idea), you would be charged with assault.  If it was totally OK, many people would be caring a baton, although many people (esp homeless) find a knife to be more practical to carry around."

439503,Dara,2010-03-04 01:47:00,3052,  A dog fight is a bit different than a yote fight. They are a wild animal and can be very mean. I had an oportunity last fall where I put a bullet in one. It was down but not dead. My buddy poked it with a stick to see just how hurt it was. I ain't ever seen nothing meaner and there is no way I would step in there to save my dog unless I had a gun with me.
439512,FishinNanna,2010-03-04 02:17:00,15,"When they were bringing in the gun registration, we got rid of all that we had (not that we had alot, but certainly something to keep one of these at bay).  Now I'm quite concerned and wish I still had a 22.  I'm a little concerned about going for walks on the country road!"
439606,ch312,2010-03-04 05:44:00,1590," well...just an FYI, spring load batons are prohibited while the ones you flick the wrist are 100% legal providing they are never concealed. the baton/holster must be visible at all times or a concealed weapon could come into play. these batons must not be taken lightly as they can kill humans quite easily. for an attacking dog id go for the ribs first and then the head.  there are different parts of the body that you whack depending on the threat level..."
439607,ch312,2010-03-04 05:51:00,1590, no it isn't. the baton is either concealed or its not. its either a spring loaded one or not. there are no gray area's when it comes to defining this weapon as prohibited or concealed...one or the other.   like i mentioned in my previous post before reading your reply. if the baton and holster are 100% visible it is not possible for you to get nailed with concealed weapon. as long as you use it for dog defense the cops cant do squat.
439609,bigfish1965,2010-03-04 05:56:00,3382," I am guessing you put up the wrong image which is why I editted it out. This thread is about coyotes, not whacking people with a baton.  Pepper spray is a very effective tool. I had a childs aluminum bat as my defense when the coyote went after my dogs. the trick is to get them apart without getting bit!!"
439612,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-04 07:05:00,158,"Seriously, when are people ever going to learn that we can't control nature.   Respect it.  Rick probably knows more than anyone else who has posted on this topic.  Take the guys Advice.  I see coyotes all the time where I live and here them every other night.  they only nail he farmers herds who don't have dogs (big dogs) or a Donkey or Lama.  The population is at an all time high, guess what happens next, a crash.  I bet we'll hear a bunch of people complaining about too many deer  and not enough coyotes to eat them in about 4-5 years.  Seriously, if you want to walk rat dogs in the dark or near habitat, use your head, and I love all the stories about the one sthat were off the leash.  Right, smart idea.  And what is teh deal with cops dealing with this, shoudln't a wildlife person like a CO take care of this, go do some real police work.  Take some money out of the police budget to hire more COs already.  I saw a young lady carrying a pomeranian while i was looking at musky baits in bass pro a couple of years back.  i was so close to asking her where she found the live bait."

439675,Syn,2010-03-04 14:48:00,519," Its my fault for not being 100% clear. ""grey"" is a sales term, it has nothing to do with prohibited by law or not. The baton (non prohibited version) is a grey market item. (edit: there are different versions to the exact definition of ""grey market"" depending on the item to be purchased but the point is ""grey"" has nothing to do with prohibited/non prohibited and everything to do with sales). ""grey"" 100% legal to sell, but government and police are making it harder for you to buy it by cutting supply in some areas (especially crime ridden).  The spring loaded baton black market item. For example: In my area we had a variety store that sold lotto tickets/food/ sweaters and hats. He also had a glass case full of knives, batons and other edged weapons, and fighting sticks (which i still have). I came back months later all that was gone. Why? Owner told me cops came and basically harassed him into not selling it any more. Told him about teenagers buying and committing crimes in the area, school stabbings, etc. He could have told the cops off but he probably weighed the pros and cons and decided not to sell anymore. I'm finding government and the police being more restrictive in how easily the general public buys weapons.  edit: exact same thing in the airsoft market (over 18). The guns look so real and have been used in holdups. They are legal to sell provided you have the proper licenses but police and government would rather not see them being sold so readily and openly especially in the city.  Here is what I wrote:  ""Sure you can find it in store but the ASP is a grey item. I can go downtown and buy brass knuckles (prohibited) even seen them in store windows in the past. Since its not a spring loaded baton you can buy it legally, but many reputable security stores that sell batons ask for ID, security lic and proof you took the baton course or they won't sell you it.

""if the baton and holster are 100% visible it is not possible for you to get nailed with concealed weapon. as long as you use it for dog defense the cops cant do squat.""   You can be charged with other offenses and it will depend on the officer and on which part of Ontario you get stopped by police with your baton. There is no way I'm going to walk around with a visible baton. To get to my local park I have to walk 5 minutes down a sidewalk passing kids going to school, people waiting for the bus with a baton. My park (humber river) has had rapes committed with the use of weapons in the past and there is a conservation and real police officers roaming the asphalt trail.  one example in the tread from blue line forum http://forums.blueline.ca/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2225  ""If I found someone carrying an ASP baton, I would definitely lay a charge under 88.(1) of the CC, Possession of Weapon for Dangerous Purpose.  The elements of the offence are proof of possession, and that the purpose of possession was one dangerous to the public peace. With an ASP baton, there is little doubt what you a carrying it for, to hit someone with it. With the singular use of the ASP, I would argue that the only reason for carrying it would be for a purpose dangerous to public peace.  The annontations, state that the section does not prevent someone from arming themselves for self protection, that an offence is not committed under this section if the accused is carrying an appropriate instrument to lawfully repel a reasonable attack, and that the accused is competent to handle the weapon, and is likely to use it responsibly.  The charge would probably go to trial, but a reasonably competent crown should be able to illustrate the training necessary for police to be able to carry the baton, and talk about the no hit areas such as the head, spine etc. If the accused does not have specific training in the ASP, it could be argued that the accused is not competent in handling it, and thus committed an offence.  It should be noted that a conviction under this section can bring a weapons prohibition order. ""  Post by Grum  ""N"" division, on horseback   So you see, you can still be charged. Cop could just give you a speech and say bye. Or charges are dropped immediately or could go to trial. You will say you were going to use it to to repel against coyotes and the officer and crown will argue about you baton certification, the specific use of a baton (not recognized and marketed as a wild animal defense), how many coyotes you have defended against in the past and even that a baton is a poor weapon of choice against wild animals because the baton is so short you have to get in really close to strike.  You will argue it was for self defense, crown will argue you were being dangerous to public peace especially if some one had called to complain and people to being intimidated by you and seeing the baton.    edit: I'll be seeing an officer later this week (family) so I'll bring it up. Please do the same with an officer in your area. I would not be surprised if we get different answers because there is no such thing as 100% consistency in application of the law.  In the end I still think a baton is not a very good choice for wild animal defense. If it were 100% guaranteed not to get charged, I would carry  a walking stick sword for wild animal defense because its lighter to swing and has twice the reach of a baton and its sharp. but if it were legal to carry around a sword then I'd upgrade to an AK-47."
439166,hammercarp,2010-03-03 03:54:00,964,A while ago I read that the eastern coyote inherited a much heavier jaw structure from it's eastern wolf ancesters. This makes them able to kill deer and makes them a lot more dangerous. I think the link to that was from this forum.

MAN UP and get in there to help your dog. i know for a fact that my two dogs would be there to help me if i was getting attacked so i'd sure as hell help them. eastern coyotes are usually 40-50lbs so they are quite small. the ones you have to worry about are ""coydogs"" which are the offspring from a coyote breeding with a domestic dog. they can grow larger and show less fear of humans.  before anyone starts...no im not an armchair warrior. ive been in the middle of some nasty dog fights and wouldnt hesitate if a couple yotes were feeling brave.  that said...i dont like really small dogs and wouldnt hold a grudge against the yotes that took out that rat dog"

Last week in the morning as the kids waited for the bus pick up, one of the mothers pointed one out not more then 50 Yards from the bus stop.

439002,Roy,2010-03-02 22:00:00,13728,"It's really too bad about the woman's pets. I must admit however that that ""reporter"" could have cleaned up the story just a touch unless he was quoting Durham police verbatim.  I was half expecting the last paragraph to read:  ""The second dog did not appear to have been hurt however, the coyote was later seen on Woodbine, propped up against a tree and smoking a cigarette. His breathing sounded stangely like a whistle."""

439006,tightline,2010-03-02 22:06:00,322, LOL...it's a dog eat dog word out there  :w00t:    Somebody had to say it!!!
439007,fishinfool,2010-03-02 22:07:00,366, Now that there's funny!! Howlllllll no pun intended.
439008,bigfish1965,2010-03-02 22:07:00,3382,"The police warnings are actually the MNR issued standard protocol. Coyotes are a big problem in the cities now. People living in the city have no idea the dangers coyotes pose. City coyotes are MUCH braver and bigger than rural coyotes. This summer could be a major problem if people do not change their habits.  Walking your small dogs at night near parks in coyote areas is no long an option. I am in the midst of a coyote study and the reports coming in are all pointing to urban coyotes now being a permanent resident of the cities and we all have to adapt to it. CARRY PEPPER SPRAY if you are in city parks. We are having signs placed in all city parks with known coyote populations so people can beware. If you live in a city with coyotes, talk to your kids and make sure they are staying away from all 'dogs'. Texas went through this a few years ago and the number of kids getting bit was alarming.  So you guys living in the country..do not think these are the same skittish coyotes you are used to. There have been reports here already of coyotes challenging adult humans.  We all have to change our ways because we cannot get rid of these animals...so we must adapt."
439009,fishinfool,2010-03-02 22:12:00,366,Last summer while walking my dog on the boardwalk at Frenchman's Bay a lady told me that a Fox had run out of the bushes and tried to grab her poodle. Another man walking with his dog chased the Fox and it ran back into the bushes. Has anyone ever heard stories of Fox doing this before?
439010,Chuck Best,2010-03-02 22:20:00,308,"A freind of mines' wife watched in horror as 4 yotes played tug o war with the family cat,right on the front porch of their house in Queensvile last summer,you would think there would be enough natural forage around,but no, the #'s are growing and at a quick rate....personally I think there should be a bounty put back on them and maybe that would help keep the #'s in check,anyhow the make nice hats.......TC and tight lines....Chuck...."
439011,pike slayer,2010-03-02 22:20:00,1177,ohhh and dont forget to bring your rape whistle to!
439014,dave524,2010-03-02 22:34:00,4508," Just tell you let a few rounds fly at it from your deer rifle, you'll have a bunch of squad cars and a SWAT Unit there in under 5 minutes"
439016,uglyfish,2010-03-02 22:42:00,981,"  thats odd... foxes are typically VERY skittish around humans, they are also not much for hunting down food, rather scavenge for it. but, ya never know rite!"
439019,irishfield,2010-03-02 22:45:00,26272,"From a guy that has had rabbies shots twice in his lifetime, me, that isn't normal behaviour for a healthy fox!  They will definitely hunt food.. usually squirrels/chipmunks/moles... but if they aren't scared of you chances are it's rabbid !  MInd you.. that said... my neighbour at the lake now has a red fox coming to the door and eating scraps out of his hand. I told him he's nuts doing so..and it's going to be a problem when his cat goes missing.. but he won't listen."
439020,Big Cliff,2010-03-02 22:47:00,6899," Trust me, they are not that skittish in the country, we often see them in broad daylight, I had several wild rabbits living around here last winter, by spring there were none to be found but there were lots of coyote tracks around.  If you are involved in a study, what sort of information do you need to help you?  Reminds me of a story:  Coyotes were descimating sheep in one area, there was a big meeting with a lot of ideas and suggestions and one tree hugging woman suggested castrating the males.  One elderly sheep farmer stood up and addressed the woman. He said ""Lady, the coyotes aren't banging my sheep, they are eating them""!"
439022,ecmilley,2010-03-02 22:50:00,2163,12 guage or compound bow is how I treat coyotes anytime i see them
439024,pike slayer,2010-03-02 23:08:00,1177,"trap and relocate them to P3TA rallys and high nusense areas and in large packs, then maybe action will take place and have a cull"
439026,bigfish1965,2010-03-02 23:19:00,3382,"Culling coyotes is a total waste of bullets. Yes, fox behaviour is changing as well and this is due to the coyotes. Just like wolves won't tolerate coyotes, coyotes will push out the foxes. This is also happening here with foxes peering into peoples homes and taking up residence in peoples yards. They are less afraid of us than the coyotes. Niagara-on-the-Lake is going through that now. The foxes are all struggling to find new places to live. It has been more than 15 years since any rabies has been found down here."
439027,Whitespinnerbait,2010-03-02 23:21:00,2038, Ummmmm...coyotes have rights to you know and they have to eat....
439030,Flappn,2010-03-02 23:32:00,245,I am moving to the country (10 acres) and the increase in Coyote's is concering me. Is there anything you can do to to prevent attracking them? Knock on wood I haven't seen one yet and there haven't really been any issues or concerns and i did see some rabbits last weekend.  I haven't checked the regs and should but might as well ask...are they hunable? I figure that may deter them a bit....
439031,camillj,2010-03-02 23:34:00,1988, Couple years back I actually watched from about 50 yards as an elderly neighbor was gardening and a mother fox and her two kits sat about 10 feet behind him and watched with interest as he planted tulips .... I was dumbfounded ... so obviously thay are not nearly as skittish as you would think ... in fact they looked like they were patiently waiting for him to finish so they could get in there and dig up all his bulbs
