439358,pike slayer,2010-03-03 19:53:00,1177,i really like these videos you have there tj. i just bought a new waterproof camera and dying to try it out. on this one lake i fish theres a sweet bay almost like a whole other lake and its loaded with pike. its amazing to watch 2-3 pike coming after your lure at once even double hooking the odd time. this summer i'm definitely taking some videos! ohh and keep them coming if you got them!!

439380,BUSTER,2010-03-03 20:35:00,1336,So true
439424,msp,2010-03-03 22:38:00,1336,If you watch closley you see it lunge twice between hits. some times they just bump the bait like crazy without ever biting it. Thanks for the sharp hook tips.
