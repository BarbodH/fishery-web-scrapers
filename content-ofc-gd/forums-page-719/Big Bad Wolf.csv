439200,Cookslav,2010-03-03 05:39:00,1457," Dude...really? I'm Not saying your in P3TA... Just pointing out the similarity of their position vs. your stance. Seriously Maybe I am dense...but your stance is not clear at all.  Muskie=Special live bait restrictions All other fish= nuts Wolves=Special protection All other species= nuts  And all this because you think Wolves and Muskie are smarter then all other species? Sorry dude but makes no sense at all to me.  I get that you obviously reeeeeely like Musky, and Wolves... Everyone is entitled to their opinion, Its just yours happens to be the same kind of opinion that got the spring bear hunt cancelled. I guess I take exception to that. Suggesting hunting be further restricted is just so backwards coming from a fellow sportsman to me, and gets under my skin a bit. Sorry for the rant, and I'm truly not trying to be a jerk.  I guess I was hopeing for clarification, but its not going anywhere so.... Away we go."
439256,Zubris21,2010-03-03 15:10:00,563,"This wolf was shot in Alberta, there was a brief article in one of the major hunting magazines but I can't recall which one.  As for the ethics of Wolf hunting...  I moved to Northern BC last year, and have taken up hunting.  From my perspective the majority of the wolf hunting is done for population control as opposed to trophy purposes.  This I guess, could in-directly be seen as a meat hunt as you are helping the meat bearing (palatable) animals survive.  Wolfs are rampant in the North, so much so that there have been numerous wolf bounties put in place over the past years.  For example this year there has been a $250 bounty for turning in wolf skulls which were obtained legally.  I don't believe this was through the MNR, but I imagine it would have been sanctioned by them.  I guess my point is that perspectives can change based on where you live and how much of a population you get to see/know, so don't judge before all the facts are gathered.  I know if I saw this bruiser walking by, he'd end up with 180gr in the boiler room."
439257,troutologist,2010-03-03 15:16:00,951,"Just a quick point on the relative size of deer.  As mammals live towards the northern part of their range their average size is larger and the population density is usually smaller.  This is a rough interpertation of Bergam Rule.   Also on the relative size of predators, it stands to reason that wolves that prey mainly on moose need to be larger than those whose diet is comprised largely of deer.  A mirror of this is observed in Tsavo, Africa where lions are much larger than those on the Savannah. Tsavo lions prey almost exclusivly on cape buffalo, and have evolved a larger size.  I've seen a few wolves that were the size of deer. 2 in particular last spring made me reassess my thoughts on the species. They were massive over 3' at the shoulder.  We tried to guess their weight and a conservative estimate was 125-150lbs....if Dr Salvelinus is reading this, how big do you think??"
438217,cram,2010-02-28 19:28:00,1733," And its not fine to just shoot deer and leave them in the bush to rot, is it?"

438401,mbac31,2010-03-01 00:06:00,904,I hseveral Wolf Fish. They are indeed ugly fish an can even bite through a fuel line in a tiller boat. Funny that someone posted that. I hope the fish was caught dead in a trap as they have been on the endangered list for some time and killing one gets you a very large fine.
438539,cram,2010-03-01 05:06:00,1733, caught on a rod apparently....i found it on a google search from this site - http://fishing-norway.com/index.php?side=N...ultat&id=10

438816,John Bacon,2010-03-02 02:49:00,3277," If I remember correctly, the deer you claim to have seen was five feet at the shoulder.  According to Answers.com white tail deer are 32 to 40 inches at the shoulder.  A wolf the size of a deer wouldn't be much more than a bight sized snack for what you claim to have seen."
438820,irishfield,2010-03-02 02:57:00,26272,"You might wanna check the size of a Canadian whitetail ...to the US mid state whitetails you have specs for there John!

438833,ch312,2010-03-02 04:27:00,1590, so basically you should have started off by saying that you are against hunting animals that wont be eaten and not that you are only against wolf hunting. i can only assume that not too many wolves are shot each year in ontario which would imply that most hunters who shoot one would be happy with their trophy. they would likely take the hide and get it tanned or donate the hide. the meat would likely be fed to dogs or left in the bush...just like coyotes.  make up your mind here...are you against wolf hunting just because or are you against hunting that involves leaving meat in the bush? these are two totally different debates...
438840,bigfish1965,2010-03-02 04:54:00,3382,"Uhh..deer in these parts are MUCH bigger than that John. If I am standing beside one and we're eye to eye (I'm 5'11"") like a few weeks back...they gotta be bigger than that!  I can see why some people are against wolf hunting. They are very close to dogs. We all love dogs. Some of us..mostly those who do not live anywhere near a wolf...see them as kind of majestic creatures. We see lots of deer and don't really have that mystique. Personally, I would not shoot a wolf. Would I shoot a coyote? I don't know. A few years ago the answer would have been no, but they are like vermin here now, so my answer is 50-50 either way. It's all relative to your experience, I think. I'd never shoot a polar bear, but a black bear yes. I would shoot a moose, but not a white moose. Does that follow any logic? No. But it is not always going to be black and white. Sometimes we just have to agree to disagree."
438841,John Bacon,2010-03-02 05:12:00,3277,"Mabe Scarborough has smaller deer... I have certainly never seen one that would be eye to eye with me.  I assume the 42"" is average so many would be taller than that but 60"" ???"
438842,cram,2010-03-02 05:17:00,1733," Actually if you go back and read the thread you'll see i started off by saying ""hope they ate'em"".   The majority of my argument (which is probably what you`re referring to) was in response to another poster suggesting htat anyone against hunting wolves is basically a member of P3TA.  I`m not at all anti-hunting.  I don`t like hunting for sport when the meat isn`t harvested.  Especially when they`re wolves....which i do find to be pretty magnificent creatures (and a non-nuisance animal).  Doesn`t make me a member of P3TA.  That said, to each his own."
438850,solopaddler,2010-03-02 09:56:00,8605,  Indeed. Mankinds greatest burden to bear is the knowledge of his own mortality.  Who's to say though what really goes through the mind of an animal. A lot more than we realize I'll bet.  Personally I think they're all plotting against us and must be shot!
438898,Cookslav,2010-03-02 14:27:00,1457," If you don't participate....in my books is fine. If you don't Like it....in my books its still fine. But Suggesting it be illegal based on a personal set of ethics is not. And yes it is in fact right on par with P3TA ethics like it or not  If its not your cup of tea...say so But don't get heated with some one suggests you re-think your position on a fishing/Hunting forum When the likeness of your veiw is colaborated in spades with the likes of P3TA.  Sugesting wolf hunting be illegal feeds directly into the P3TA Machine.... First its ""save the wolves"", next its fishing is Murder... Catch my drift?  I'm not suggesting your a full blown member of P3TA, I'm merely pointing out a hypocritical point in your post which perhaps you could clarify or retract?  Not hunting based on a personal choice is cool... Not hunting and suggesting it should be illegal....not so much"
438901,cram,2010-03-02 15:12:00,1733," I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  I'm all for hunting when the animal is harvested for food.  Don't like it when the carcass is left in the woods (especially when its a wolf).   If you think that makes me a member of P3TA, then i guess we'll have to agree to disagree.  I also think musky fishing with live bait should be illegal (kills too many fish), and i throw musky lures all season.  Does that make me a member of P3TA as well?"

439137,John Bacon,2010-03-03 02:53:00,3277, Personally I can't really judge the height of the deer without something beside it to provide some scale...  interestingly a quick google search lists Elk as being 4 to 5 feet at the shoulder with only the bulls approaching the upper range.  That makes it pretty hard for me to picture a wolf or white tail reaching that size.
439168,danc,2010-03-03 04:00:00,4677," Google and askme searches are great, but nothing is better than witnessing something for yourself. You're right. There's nothing in the photo to guage the animal with. I'm pretty sure that nobody that works at either google or askme saw this particlular animal, but I did. Here's my best guess. 40""legs, 24"" leg to shoulder, 14""shoulder to ears. That's a 6 1/2 foot animal before you add the antlers. You wouldn't want to get between him and a doe during the rut. John, I see these massive animals frequently. If I wasn't stuck in Red Lake right now I could try to go out and get something in a photo to scale it with. They are common in the north."
439169,Carp,2010-03-03 04:00:00,1488," I seen wolves chasing a deer while I watched from my tree stand. Just NE of Newmarket. Yes, they were wolves. 2 almost as big as the one in this thread and a third about the size of a full grown German Sheppard.  The deer ran along the edge of a field, around a corner and down into a gully. Three wolves appeared at the edge of the field and appeared to be communicating about how to get the deer, which was now circling back into the bush. Two wolves went after the deer and a third doubled back into the bush to cut off the deer as it tried to run back through the forest.  After a few minutes, the two wolves that went after the deer re-appeared at the edge of the forest, completing a big circle. The third wolf remained in the bush, listening and waiting for the deer to run back to the deep woods. I made a soft doe call and they started walking toward me. Had them about 15 yards away, when they walked behind a small bush, just big enough to conceal them, and disappeared. Kind of freaked me out a bit how they just vanished. I watched that bush for about 20 minutes and nothing moved out from behind the bush. I was worried about getting out of my stand because I wasn't sure if they had left.  Yes, I believe wolves have some planning and strategy to their hunts. Never would have believed it if I hadn't seem it myself."

439191,Cookslav,2010-03-03 04:57:00,1457," No, But its an odd position for me to digest?...and I'm guessing I'm not alone in that statement.  I would understand your stance if you thought live bait should be illegal in general for all species.... But if the only reason you think it should be illegal is the Musky mortality rate I'm confused? Why view the life of musky over an above all other fish?  Ethically speaking it is very narrow to me...I don't mean to be offensive but its odd to me? It's really just kind of strange to pick and choose which creatures deserve more protection or respect then others based on what you consider to be smarter animals?  I could agree to disagree and appreciate your stance if there was a rhyme or reason such as endangered numbers. But to pick and choose species for protection over and above others and point the stick at your fellow sportsman as foul comes across as a bit arrogant IMO  But I suppose in some ways it is better then a blanket statement which is what P3TA does....although in truth their position is a bit more clear LOL.

439194,cram,2010-03-03 05:11:00,1733," Yep - its pretty smart stuff.  They will also line up and ""relay race"" deer and other game.....instead of a mob of wolves chasing a deer and tiring together, they set up in advance spots along a projected chase line to take turns running the deer into an ambush.

Those instincts may be highly refined, sophisticated, and effective.....but they don't think subjectively or with a serious level of context or emotion.  They have the simplest brains of all vertebrates, and msot of their ""thinking"" happens in the brain stem where stuff is more ""automatic"" than thoguht through...if htat makes sense.  To give you some examples - do you think a fish has fun?  Feels sad?  Feels regret?  Loyalty?   Anger?   OR does a fish ever think -- hey, maybe i'll go over to the other side of hte lake and see what Joe's doing?  I don't think a musky ever thinks any of those things.  I know my dog does."

437654,cram,2010-02-27 01:24:00,1733," Could be a zillion page thread that incorporates different views on religion, philosophy, etc.  In short, maybe we define sentience differently.  I think a dog... - has feelings  (joy, sadness, angry, etc) - is self aware (ever see a dog walk around a room boasting with pride with a big stick or a ball in its mouth, or a dog that's embarassed?) - is subjective...(see a dog act more gently around elderly or babies) - has relationships (its pretty hardwired in them, obviously.....its what makes them great pets).  I don't know that it is sentience....but its definitely different from a fish.  And i love fish...they're just more ""simple"".  Anyway - i'm don't disparage anyone who hunts wolves.   It is everyone's legal right.  I just wish the laws were different.  I also think fishign for musky with live bait should be illegal.  And i think the sport fishing possession limits are often too high.     I'm not a P3TA type...just happen to like wolves.  I also enjoy eating venison, moose,  duck, and ruffled grouse."

Amazingly enough I never actually saw a single wolf in all my travels in the Hudsons Bay lowlands, on the rivers that spill into the bay. Polar bears yes, wolves no.   The wolf I saw in Puk actually walked into my campsite, stopped and stared at me from maybe 30 feet away. It was reddish brown in colour, very shaggy looking.

437305,doubleheader,2010-02-26 14:26:00,497,"Our coyote population in PA, which has now been proven to contain wolf genes, has exploded over the last 20 years. I read an interesting article in Pennsylvania Sportman just this week entitled the ""Disnification of Wolves and Coyotes"".  According to this author the conservation people in Yellowstone are the ones that got this propaganda started, convincing the tourists the wolves are like the Disney animals we see on tv. Again according to this author there is danger in misinforming people that these creatures are nearly harmless creatures in that they begin to lose their fear of man. He went on to site and classify the reported coyote attacks and showed that while the number over the last 20 years remains low it doubled over the previous period, and that the nature of these attacks were such that one could draw a reasonable conclusion that the animals were hunting the humans (a significant number were children playing in their yards), they were not the result of surprising the animals . It was an interesting take, not sure myself if the cause of the increase isn't simply a result of the increased population. I would think the bigger danger is the fallout from this misinformation, the anti- hunting mentality that results from folks that think these predators either have some higher form intelligence or that they are just furry balls of cuddley love. Neither is true.  Personally I believe legal hunting of both coyotes and wolves is acceptable.  It is designed to maintain a healthy population of the animals while maintaining needed population control. Additionally hunting brings in much needed revenue to many remote areas around the world. I have never killed a coyote, they're wiley buggers, but I've seen quite a few while either scouting or hunting. That said there are now a great number of coyote hunts organized across the state. I'm thankful for these sportsmen and women for keeping the population of these predators in some semblance of control."
437338,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 15:29:00,3382,"In the midst of all this I will say we all are entitled to opinions. No one is right or wrong. There is much to be said about trophy hunting and much to be said about trying to maintain the balance of a top level predator population.  I will say that trying to control coyotes via hunting is a waste of time and bullets. Much studying shows it is a futile effort. Their population levels are only determined by food source. Only in a full scale organized extirpation would have an impact. However we need to coyotes to control mouse, rabbit and other prey levels.  I would not shoot a wolf, but that's just me. I used to think I would not shoot a coyote either, but after having one attack my dogs last summer, I would not hesitate should one come looking again...except I can't shoot in city limits so a good old fashioned beat-down will have to suffice.  Hunting and fishing are forever intertwined and we do have to show support for the hunters otherwise fishing is threatened as well. The unfortunate thing about hunting is that catch and release has not really been shown to be effective ...  This summer will be Ontario's first glimpse by urban dwellers of the coyote problem. The numbers indicate that problems are inevitable. There will be dogs taken, cats missing and kids bitten. The density is at a critical point. But study after study has shown that hunting won't fix it. We have to change our behaviour. We have to stop being a food source and they will retreat from the cities.  Thank the MNR for their massive rabies immunization programs over the last several years. Had it not been for that we would have already had BIG problems."

437353,cram,2010-02-26 15:57:00,1733," You may want to do some research yourself, my friend.  If you knew anything about wolves, you'd know that they often work in coordinated hunts where some members of the pack drive prey to ambush points where other members are waiting to join in.  Soemtimes it is more complex with 2 or 3 different groups waiting at ambush points taking turns running prey down.  There's lots of verbal communication btwn them to signal actions on the hunt as well.  As for intelligence....i would like to think that if chimpanzees or gorillas were native to Canada we would not hunt them.  Or if dolphins swam in ontario's lakes we would not hunt or fish them.  Obviously wolves are not on their level....but the point is the same. And wolves are a billion times more sentient than a fish.   And certainly more intelligent than an ungulate.   If people ate wolves...fine.  I just would choose not to hunt them as trophies.  I don't begrudge you for doing it.  But don't consider me a member of P3TA for not doing it.  Final point - as others have pointed out already, comparing wolves to coyotes is like comparing muskies to rock bass.  I wouldn't hunt coyotes either - they're still intelligent, and hunting them provides zero value in controlling population - but there might be one pack of wolves for every 150 square miles.  Coyotes are more like rock bass....they can over populate an area."
437366,torco,2010-02-26 16:15:00,656,"Not my cup of tea, I don't particularly like the way the pictures are taken but as easy as it is to judge you can't really get too bent out of shape over hunting of a wolf where deemed appropriate and not have a problem with any other hunting. It would be hypocritical. Its like the P3TA people upset about furs and seals but walk around in clothing made of oil, how is that better for the earth?  I do feel some sadness for the wolf that was harvested but no more than I would for any of the earths other creatures."
437380,troutologist,2010-02-26 16:46:00,951,"A well managed sport hunt is one of the most effective ways to control predators.  The nature in which wolves were killed in the last 150 years or so in Canada resulted in very low wolf numbers. Ecosystems adapted a new homeostasis, once these natural controllers of ungulates and smaller prey species were removed.  Recently, conservation efforts, regulations and general lack of harvest have brought back wolf numbers to much higher levels.  With little or no control on these species there will be a natural cycle of boom followed by bust, through which nature will find a new equilibruim for wolf numbers and prey numbers.  The abundance of deer and moose are of great concern to resource managers, particularly due to the resource user demands (hunters) for abundant game.  To agument this natural cycle, the use of hunting as a management tool is extremely effective and if done properly quite humane.  Think about this if you would, if there is an overabundance of wolves in a particular area there is inherently increased competition for resources, which are generally present in a limited amount.  Younger wolves are forced into new territory with the outcome of conflicting with other dominant wolves or humans, both scenarios are usually detrimental to animal health.  Further, once an area surpasses its (wolf) carrying capacity, there is a die off through starvation or disease.  Granted both natural methods for keeping populations in check.  High densities will yeild a lower overall population health and may have long term inpacts of a diluted (or less fit) gene pool.  Due to the nature of human interference in natural systems, we cannot ignore the responsibility to manage nature. Often a well placed bullet will provide a more humane end than the potential suffering I mention above.  I would love to debate this topic with others, I'm curious to hear thoughts on it. However, often these issues require a bit more investigation and deliberation that a quick google search or a wikipedia ctrl-c/ctrl-v...."
437400,Steel28,2010-02-26 17:48:00,160," x 3  well said Cookslav, let's not promote P3TA  How about slaughtered beef, chickens and other hormone ejected meals? I got into hunting for ethical reasons."
437401,Cookslav,2010-02-26 17:50:00,1457," I don't begrudge you at all cram, But your sending a mixed message.... If you don't begrudge hunters for doing it, why would you think it should be illegal?  Not par taking in a wolf hunt because its not your cup of tea is one thing...thinking and sideing with P3TA is another     Bingo...some smart men right there"
437403,cityfisher,2010-02-26 17:52:00,959,"I was on haliburton lake which is very close to Algonquin found 2 fresh wolf kills and even heard them outside the cottage  Try hunting them , probably one of the hardest game to target"
437435,Kilka,2010-02-26 18:57:00,17," Again, you are wrong about wolf interactions, especially about interactions between packs. Relationships between different wolf packs are generally hostile.  I do agree however that you should eat whatever you hunt for.  And yeah people comparing wolves to coyotes are l-o-l.  And again, stop making the intelligence point.  Wolves' social capabilities do not make it any more or less intelligent than other animals.  May I ask what kind of scale you are using to guage intelligence here?"
437441,cram,2010-02-26 19:17:00,1733," I think you're misunderstanding. I don't mean that PACKS collaborate.  Wolves WITHIN the pack collaborate in an intelligent and forward-thinking manner.    Instead of just mobbing an animal in one giant mass, many wolf packs will set up a coordinated hunt with a few members chasing game into ambush points, where other wolves are waiting.  Or, sometimes with 2 or 3 different spots, depending on the type of game (size/endurance/ease of takign it down).  There are lots of different scales to judge intelligence.   However we judge them, a wolf (relatively complex, sophisticated vertebrate) is far more intelligent than a fish (maybe the simplest vertebrate brains).  As for social stuff....your best example was ants, which do indeed have sophisticated social systems, but they are hardly ""emotional"".   I hate to use the dog comparison because dogs are pets....but a wolf's emotional intelligence is far closer to rufus than an ant."
437442,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 19:20:00,3382, I do not think the same applies for coyotes..especially now with the prey levels still very high in this area because of the successive wet summers. Managing numbers via hunts or culls during high prey pop'n cycles is like peeing into the wind. It is like the urban beaver and the futile efforts we saw here to control the numbers. Trapping resulted in killing dominant females which sent all the females into estrus. This pushed the litters way up since the food source was still far ahead of demand. There are remarkable and concerning differences in the urban versus rural canid behaviours that are starting to surface. The coyotes are pushing the red foxes out in Niagara on the Lake and I am hearing more and more reports of foxes taking up residence in peoples yards. The yotes have been forming loose pack affiliations. The sheer numbers are staggering and I can PM you some farmer cull numbers.  Interestingly I think the answer is opening more areas to deer hunting. This may push the coyote litters down.
437446,Headhunter,2010-02-26 19:31:00,5703,I bet the Roadrunners aren't very happy with all the coyotes either! HH
437448,cram,2010-02-26 19:32:00,1733, Beep beep!!!!
437450,troutologist,2010-02-26 19:33:00,951,"  You raise a very interesting point Rick. In my understanding you're correct, attempts to control coyotes have been an immense challenge and money sink with little in the way of success.  I was speaking with some wildlife disease folks this week and they were mentioning in areas of the US where this is the case, they are seeing very rapid mutation of new rabies varients.  These new varients are actually getting quite specific in target species.  Hunting/trapping is not the only answer to the predator problem, especially in an urban/suburban setting.  I appreciate the challenges of the resource managers when a number of groups are pressuring with their own interests and the manager needs to meet on middle ground while still trying to maintain a healthy ecosystem.  Is the Govt or muncipality still actively attempting control measures in your area?"
437460,irishfield,2010-02-26 19:41:00,26272, But the coyote caught the road runner..did I not send you that video???
437465,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 19:48:00,3382,"We are currently pushing the municipalities in this direction, but the resources are scarce. It really hit fast and hard and caught them off guard. With all the new green spaces (usually connected by brown fields) and urban sprawl and the unexpected nearly exponential population changes, it is all very new. We still do not have Forestry Management Plans so it is tough sledding to get them to see the need for Wildlife Management Plans. The MNR, to date, has no real new ideas though their approach at educating urban dwellers is good, its just not being embraced by the towns. The municipal gov'ts are afraid to wade into it hoping the MNR will take control...which isn't going to happen. We've not had a confirmed case of rabies here in nearly 20 years. I know in Texas their big problem is the number of bites to children mistaking them for dogs. Chicago has an extensive urban coyote program as does Vancouver. I have been reading their stuff and it all points to one common theme...they are here and are going to stay, so get used to it. Our biggest problem so far is people. They are inadvertently feeding them (loose pets, outdoor dog/cat food, unsecured garbage) so we are now seen as a food source."
437474,troutologist,2010-02-26 20:05:00,951,"I'm uncertain of its effect on coyotes but there is a caribou herd co managed by Alaska and Canada, which they are trying to reduce predation by sterilizing male wolves.  Act of mating occurs but fertilization/implantation doesn't.  I'm sure someone has thought of this previously with coyotes though??"
437491,cram,2010-02-26 20:37:00,1733, There's lots of research on coyotes' compensatory reproduction countering the effects of culling.   You'd have to think someone has thought of or tried sterilizing them.

437216,xeon,2010-02-26 05:30:00,350," I definitely agree with what you have written.  Furthermore, people have to realize that everyone has their own view on ethics, and everyone likes to express it. What they don't realize is, nobody cares about your ethics, because unless you're easily persuaded, your ethics are set in stone and are not changing -both a good and bad thing. When someone doesn't like what they hear, they turn into holier than thou fundamentalists, or what I like to call ""weekend conservationists"". Don't dare shoot the plentiful dogs for sport because its disgusting, but you're dam right we're keeping the biggest fish in the lake for a conversation piece. Seriously, wheres the difference? How about stop putting different species into different piles based on your ""Give-a-Dam"" scale. You can spray a bee hive in Raid with a big smile on your face, but would shed a tear putting a hole through a dog.  As to how we should define our ethics and actions, generally speaking we use the law. It's basically the ""bottom line"" to determine if something is ethical or not, mainly because its a set of rules formed by our government that we all, in the end, have to agree with.  So to those who don't like the hunted wolves, its time to open your mind up a bit. Hunting doesn't always have to be just for food, there is a factor of sport involved with it."

Even an amoeba will writhe around to try to escape a pin prick.  Anyway - i'm not slamming hunting.  I ate venison earlier this week.  I just don't like hunting wolves.

The government believes that there is an over abundance of coyotes so they need to be ""thinned"" in a sense. I'd say coyotes are even smarter than wolves from allot of things I've seen. Are you going to get upset over that too now that even smarter animals are being shot left and right? http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/coyote-control  Basically, the OMNR has switched to a ""SUSTAINABILITY"" approach to fisheries and wildlife management. That means, if something can not SUSTAIN an open season, there will, under no circumstance, be an open season. The wolves are currently open to harvest because they are... SUSTAINABLE. Also, there is $$$ in it for the government if Americans come up and hunt them through license costs. That money is then put into a special purpose account for Fish and Wildlife related use, which helps pay for your fish stocking for example.  If you don't like it, well, thats kinda too bad, its going to happen, and keep on happening. And some of us will continue to thoroughly enjoy it."

However, in the last few years there have been so many coyotes around here that they have started to become a real problem. They are getting bolder coming right into farm yards and killing live stock even in broad day light. It use to be very rare that you'd even catch a glimps of one, we often see them out here on the lake now.  A local farmer shot 23 of them here last winter, most of them right from his back porch. Four years ago there were lots of turkeys and deer around here then a pack of coyotes moved into the area. It didn't take very long before we started to see less and less deer and turkey. When their populations dropped the coyotes started going for livestock.  I am very privlidged to be able to hunt several farms around here but I can tell you right now that if I was hunting one of those farms and didn't shoot a coyote if I had the chance, the farmer wouldn't be very happy about it.  For those of you that think it is wrong to kill something you aren't going to eat; what do you do when you are fishing and catch a goby? Deep fried or just lightly battered?"
437256,Kilka,2010-02-26 12:16:00,17,"Cram,  You are wrong on so many points about wolves. They DO hunt in packs, but they DO NOT organise ambushes.  In fact, there is little planned cooperation when they bring down an animal.  So before you make sweeping statements, at least get educated.  Here's a wiki page to get you started:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_Wolf  Your emotional/intelligent argument is also out of place. You don't know what an animal thinks or feels, and there are rarely correct ways to rank intelligence. Wolves have a seemingly complicated pack life, but you don't know what that is based on. Ants seemingly have an even more comlicated community life than wolves, a life that even humans would have difficulty organising. Is an ant smarter than you?"

You can't hunt them in the park and recently the MNR canceled the hunt in 3 townships in the round lake area based on sceintific study. The wolves were leaving the park in this areas to feed in the deer yards located in those areas, and some wolves were being harvested once they left the park. But have no fear Algonquin Wolf numbers are doing just fine, and there is little concern about the current balance. The bigger concern at this point is conserving the Eastern Wolf genes as pure....Grey wolf and Coyotes genes are interbreeding.

437132,Dutchy,2010-02-26 01:50:00,416, I was wondering that as well.
437134,archie_james_c,2010-02-26 01:50:00,618,"New world record, shot in Alberta I beleive, google ""world record wolf"" it will bring you to a film companies web site, apparently they got it all on tape."
437146,xeon,2010-02-26 02:18:00,350,"They're hunted for the thrill of the hunt, as well as their hide, and there is nothing wrong with that. I can already see a discussion on ethics in the brew."
437148,Kinger,2010-02-26 02:20:00,351,thats disgusting.
437151,tb4me,2010-02-26 02:23:00,3295,I was afraid to post my opinion on this..Im glad I did and Im also glad im not the only one..
437171,cram,2010-02-26 02:56:00,1733,this is the kind of world record wolf i like....  
437175,grt1,2010-02-26 03:03:00,638,"Wow, that is one ugly fish, why would anyone want to keep that?"
437180,cram,2010-02-26 03:15:00,1733, world record wolf.
437181,BillM,2010-02-26 03:19:00,17367,  It was shot in Bulgaria if I'm not mistaken...  There are stories of it being shot in Alberta and even Gogama!!  lol
437182,Beans,2010-02-26 03:24:00,3339, Hey watch it CPH...I resemble that remark !!!
437198,bigugli,2010-02-26 03:59:00,6138,Now you see where the idea of the werewolf comes from. A dog the size of a man and does not have the same fear of man that most wildlife have.
437204,Cookslav,2010-02-26 04:31:00,1457," If its taken in a legal season there is nothing wrong with it at all, and its no different then harvesting any other animal, or fish for that matter. Be it for a hide, sustinace or trophy its legal and I'd tread carefully on how you value one animal over another lest ye give P3TA amunition. Outdoorsman alike should support our kin even if is not our cup of tea.  If I shot a wolf for a hide...is it any different then you taking a Muskie, or a bass in season to be stuffed? Its the same thing except some people revere Wolves as Dogs, and think of them as Pets....which they ain't.  The MNR sets the guidelines around here, and they do it based on hard science to promote ""healthy"" populations keeping sport in mind as a secondary thought. It all plays into a master plan that acounts for other animals that the Wolves prey on such as Beavers, Rabbits, Deer, Moose etc... It's all about balance, and we should leave that to the experts.  Its the tree hugger mantality that canceled the Spring Bear hunt and that is not exsactly sitting well with people these day is it?  To each there own as long as its with in the law, and the law is doing their due dillegence in supporting a sustainable healthy population.  Sorry if I come across as harsh but don't go spouting off about wanting to hunt the hunters cause you feel bad for the big wild puppy dogs "
437206,Stern Rules,2010-02-26 04:50:00,342,Oh that's funny.
437207,cram,2010-02-26 05:00:00,1733," I don't mind hunting when the animal is harvested for sport AND food.  Not really a fan of harvesting for trophies....be it a wolf, a musky, or anythign else for that matter.  And, to your point -- muskies have tiny brains that are very simple.  They are more instinctive than thinkers.  They certainly do not have emotions.  Wolves are intelligent, social animals.  They collaborate on hunts...and do things that demonstrate intelligence and sentience that fish and deer/moose/etc don't have.  I don't blame anyone for hunting wolves...it is legal. But, i do think it should be illegal.  Killing whales was legal at one point as well.   Think about that."
