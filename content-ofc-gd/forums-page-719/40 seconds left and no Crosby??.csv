438573,canadadude,2010-03-01 13:22:00,769,"I guess my super tonight is a big ole CROW hehehe,I was more then skeptical about this team but in the end they played well together and achieved the goal, congratulations Team Canada. You only turned into pylons for 2min in the 3rd, just to test my weak heart.Hats off to a Canadian Hockey Hero, Sidney Crosby at 21 yrs of age he has cemented himself as great Canadian Hockey Legend, it's going to be hard for him to top that goal. Great game by 2 great teams, a fitting end to 2 weeks of incredible international sport, by far the best winter Olympics I've seen. Great job by all the Atheletes, Volunteers, the City of Vancover and the Country of Canada it truely was a memorable Olympic Games"
438640,tb4me,2010-03-01 17:32:00,3295, What he said!! Im still an awe! Go Canada..Sid the kid for PM lol
438644,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-01 17:44:00,0,qmjhl champ; world jr's gold; stanley cup champ; olympic gold... he must be really lucky!  what has ovechkin won again?
438658,capt bruce,2010-03-01 19:03:00,820,"what has ovechkin won again?   I think it was the ""MOST LIKELY TO BE GAY "" the whos in the NHL that hides in the closet contest"
438699,Twocoda,2010-03-01 21:41:00,4130,  he won a GIECO caveman look-a-like contest......
438706,Dutchy,2010-03-01 22:04:00,416," Two Stanley cup finals in a row is not to be sniffed at either even if you do only win one of them. I lived in the burgh for 3 years, still support the Pens."
438710,Radnine,2010-03-01 22:10:00,1538,  I still think that Pronger is a wanker (he's just a wanker with a gold medal). Jim
438741,JohnF,2010-03-01 23:28:00,3494," The way he started I thought he was gonna get benched, but then he got with the program. However, despite reactivating his brain for part of the game, he still got away with a big crosscheck that should have put us on the PK.  JF"
438830,Cudz,2010-03-02 04:11:00,2652,"I am not a Pronger fan at all but he really had a solid game.  As far as Sid not scoring much, just remember this.  Every other team puts out their best shut down line as soon as Crosby is on the ice.  He often has to play against the best opposing defensive players.  This is beneficial to the rest of his team as those defensive specialist never play against other lines thus allowing for more offense when Sid is on the bench."
438924,JohnF,2010-03-02 16:50:00,3494, He also serves who sits and waits?  JF
438937,blaque,2010-03-02 17:40:00,2419, Confucius?
438949,tb4me,2010-03-02 18:29:00,3295,Exactally..half the time when Crosby is on the ice he double covered and that openes up the ice for the rest of the team! The dude had 4 goals 3 assists? Thats not low scoring at all.Considering were playing each countrys supposed allstar teams..The sid the kid VS Ovenchicken thing is just silly..Ove is an amazing player and I say we get him on a Canadian team offer him dual citizenship and a chance to play for a real team in 2014 Yeah baby!!!!!
438965,JohnF,2010-03-02 19:11:00,3494, Who did he play for?  JF
438966,JohnF,2010-03-02 19:14:00,3494, A garbled John Milton.  JF
439001,blaque,2010-03-02 21:58:00,2419, Shandong River Otters
439013,JohnF,2010-03-02 22:28:00,3494, QHL?  JF
439045,Twocoda,2010-03-03 00:14:00,4130, Quite Heavy League?  i hear they have a short season due to thin ice
438301,Cudz,2010-02-28 22:32:00,2652,I see the time out and I am thinking put crosby on.  He needs to be out there for speed.  I am angry now.  I know he hasn't had a great tourney but come on!!!!!!!!!!!
438309,buckster,2010-02-28 22:35:00,530,he's been smelling up the joint!
438310,Stoty,2010-02-28 22:35:00,2910,He's been invisible for the past 2 games...as well as this one. Gotta go with who's hot.
438316,Cudz,2010-02-28 22:38:00,2652,No way.  Got to go with speed not strength.
438323,buckster,2010-02-28 22:41:00,530,"Yup he is so fast, So fast in fact that he's invisible!"
438324,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-28 22:42:00,4399,He`s looked more like Bing Crosby!!!
438331,BUSTER,2010-02-28 22:53:00,1336,saves the day
438337,Cudz,2010-02-28 22:54:00,2652,take that crosby haters!!!!!!!!!
438342,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-28 22:56:00,4399,  That Bing can shoot the puck!!!LOL
438343,buckster,2010-02-28 22:57:00,530,Figures lol
438348,Dusky,2010-02-28 23:03:00,310,He decided to peak at the best time:)  What a goal will be going in memory lane for long.............
438351,JohnF,2010-02-28 23:07:00,3494,Need he say more?  JF
438354,jjcanoe,2010-02-28 23:12:00,744,Still trying to figure out why Babcock called the timeout in the first place?????????? did he think the US players needed some extra rest???  jjcanoe
438358,kickingfrog,2010-02-28 23:20:00,8333,"Clueless, if you're measuring a hockey player by goals and assist. Thank goodness you all didn't have a say in picking the team. Stick to fishin'."
438359,holdfast,2010-02-28 23:22:00,1813,Good thing he got benched in overtime eh.
438360,Cookslav,2010-02-28 23:22:00,1457, Ditto LOL....
438378,danc,2010-02-28 23:35:00,4677,"I'm not a Crosby hater at all, but why do you need speed when you have all 12 players bottlenecked inside the blue line? What good is speed in that situation? You need big bodies to muscle guys off of the puck. Sure, it didn't work out but I think it was the correct call. It was a defensive situation."
438400,Twocoda,2010-03-01 00:05:00,4130,   Bing Crosby was a hero too ...i have some of his 8 tracks
438424,Sandbag,2010-03-01 00:28:00,533,  True enough...Crosby just being on the ice opens so much up for everyone else on the ice.  It's very hard to see the impact that he has on the ice without seeing the whole surface.  Cheers  Craig
438426,scuro2,2010-03-01 00:38:00,904,So shudauppa you Crosby haters!!
438433,Radnine,2010-03-01 01:02:00,1538,"I always knew that you were clever Cudz, but you look like a genius now! Jim"
438447,Marty,2010-03-01 01:18:00,873,"I guess we''re stuck with him here in Pittsburgh.   He's a current Cup champ, he scored two game winners in the Olympics and his final goal will immortalize him.   He sucks.    Does anyone want my signed jersey?   I'm going to throw it away."
438456,scuro2,2010-03-01 01:33:00,904,...and what did you accomplish at 20?
438529,holdfast,2010-03-01 04:12:00,1813," yea like all the arm chairs slagging Pronger, Niedermayer, Richards, Thornton, Getzlaf, etc etc.   They may of never scored, but I can tell you despite their size, they seemed in the opposition end more than their own.  yea, now that I really had a chance to see Niedermayer play, now I know why he is a great Captain and defenseman."
438561,solopaddler,2010-03-01 12:48:00,8605,"Just noticed this thread, how ironic the earlier posters were bashing Sid.  On a side note Sid was interviewed shortly after the game was over. Was asked how it felt to score the winning goal after being held pointless the previous 3 games.  Honestly, considering the moment, and with the entire country watching and behind the team, a simple ""Great game Sid, congratulations!, And from all of Canada THANK YOU!""  It would have been much more appropriate."
