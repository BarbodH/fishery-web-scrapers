439365,Spiel,2010-03-03 20:10:00,9065,I wish I could but I'm busy building rods.
439386,solopaddler,2010-03-03 20:46:00,8605, That's right. Don't even think about fishing 'till my rods are done!    
439393,Spiel,2010-03-03 21:05:00,9065,LOL....I've done enough for one day. Time to eat and rest with your permission of course.  I gotta say though the colour scheme is beauty.
439411,Great Lake Steel,2010-03-03 21:44:00,41,"Spiel, this and your fly threads have piqued my interest. What rods you tie, and what are your prices (maybe some examples?). If they're half as good as your flies they're masterpieces.  I'm in 'watching the highway and calculating how much daylight is left to justify if I leave early to go fishing' mode."
439417,solopaddler,2010-03-03 22:10:00,8605,  Fantastic. I thought it would be good but it was a total guess. Glad I went with the colour preserver I think.
439457,Rob,2010-03-04 00:13:00,467,"Well Solo, I guess you were right! My two buddies went out this afternoon and got 2 whities each in a 1/2 hour. They said they were hitting like crazy out there.  Rob C"

439666,Spiel,2010-03-04 14:15:00,9065," Well GLS, I guess over the 35 years I've been building rods there isn't much I haven't built. Prices will generally run from a few hundred dollars to over a thousand. Depends entirely on what the customer wants.  Here's a shot of the butt wraps on 2 of my float rods.    This one belongs to Gerritt, the butt wrap is pre finish.  "
439676,blaque,2010-03-04 14:53:00,2419,"WOW, ive never seen or heard of this before. Pretty crazy.  I have seen this phenomena and its equally as cool. Thought my mind was playin tricks on me when i saw something similar to the picture here a couple years back  "
