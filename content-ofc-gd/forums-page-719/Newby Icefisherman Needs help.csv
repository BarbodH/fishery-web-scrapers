The perch are pretty much always on, good chance of pike at almost anytime in the perch grounds and you can switch it up for whities and lakers if you want. Also, lots of decent operators on Simcoe, depending where you want to head out from. Good luck, Darcy"
438921,Governator,2010-03-02 16:37:00,879,A lot of huts will be coming off of simcoe and others by this weekend.  The warm temps are going to give the shorelines a pounding.  Still a lot of ice but it'll be wet and I'm not sure how stable it will be.  So just be safe out there.

I'd go to Port Burwell or check into it we took home about 20 perch from there none under 11 inches...caught about 100 but who needs that many!!
