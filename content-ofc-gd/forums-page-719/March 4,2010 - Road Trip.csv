We drove out Route 133 from Collins Bay to the Generating Station, the North Channel is ice covered and appears to be solid enough to support the commercial fishermen who are out on the ice (100 yds from shore) tending their nets. North Channel ice covered from Finkles Launch ramp to the generating station.  Hay Bay is ice-covered with some spots of open water that are filled with ducks.There are holes in the ice around Ram Island, we saw some guys out on the ice - guess they were fishing for perch.  Headed over to Huffs Road for a peek. Lots of blue water there.    Another Angle,    There was ALL kinds of open wtaer around Forresters Island.  Only eight weeks til open water walleye......................  Stay Tuned."
