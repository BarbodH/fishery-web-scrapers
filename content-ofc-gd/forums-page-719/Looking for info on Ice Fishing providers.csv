438791,raptorfan,2010-03-02 01:35:00,126,"Hey guys and gals,  A friend and I are looking at getting out one last time before the thaw.  We are thinking of a day on Scugog, Simcoe, or Quinte.  I wouldn't mind targeting lakers and whitefish which from my research seem accessible in simcoe, but just perch and pickerel are fine by me as well.  If anyone can offer up any good experiences with outfitters in these areas they have found, or outfitters to stay away from, it would be greatly appreciated.  We are hoping to go next thursday, weather permitting.........  thanks in advance  shawn"
438982,cityfisher,2010-03-02 20:49:00,959,QUinte walleye season is now closed.  Id check out the Lake simcoe board for outfitter reviews.  I can recommend http://simcoefishingadventures.com/ for perch on cooks... Tell him papageorio told about it.
438987,Jer,2010-03-02 20:56:00,1426,The walleye season is also now closed on Scugog as well and huts have been removed. You can still go out for panfish on the lake though.
438989,cheaptackle,2010-03-02 21:12:00,849,"All non-portable huts had to be off in zone 17 (Kawarthas including Scugog) & Quinte yesterday.  Walleye closed in Scugog & Quinte Sunday night.  Kawarthas now have a year round season on perch, sunfish, crappie & pike though.  Simcoe is about your only option for operators for now.  With the warm weather this week I wouldn't wait too long, conditions could deteriorate rapidly.  Michael"
439046,raptorfan,2010-03-03 00:15:00,126,"thanks for the info guys, much appreciated. If perch is all that is available, I might as well just stay here and fish the inner bay at st williams if there is still ice.  Nights look like they are staying cold enough, so there is hope."
439048,Roy,2010-03-03 00:27:00,13728,Now would be a good time to seriously reconsider plans of venturing out on the ice. But hey...that's just my opinion.
