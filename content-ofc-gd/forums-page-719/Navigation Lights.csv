439304,Fisherman,2010-03-03 17:13:00,7201,"On my old boat I had the regular lightbulb version,red/green front and white glowstick on the back, enough to keep you legal and from getting run over by the bassboat nuts(not all) that just absolutely have to go 100mph in the dark."
439307,GBW,2010-03-03 17:17:00,8460,not me but thanks for the link!
439310,bassjnkie,2010-03-03 17:24:00,1101,My uncle has those on his 12'. They are bright and work really good.
439316,danbouck,2010-03-03 17:45:00,4380,LED lights are great. Should work perfect
439317,Dara,2010-03-03 17:47:00,3052,"Cheaper at CT, but not that amazing cammo colour...why would you want a cammo light?"
439319,irishfield,2010-03-03 17:50:00,26272,"Daughter used one everynight, the summer of 2005, to drive from work at Temagami Shores back to our island. With it on.. and a mini mag light in her hand (shining up) for the white light and I could see her for the entire distance.  ..and as said, just walk into CTC.. cheaper there and no postage!"
439328,MooseMerch,2010-03-03 18:16:00,68,Right on thanks fellas
439330,MooseMerch,2010-03-03 18:18:00,68,"  They have camo and no-camo, not sure why they have a camo 1, they also have camo couches..."

439556,skeeter,2010-03-04 03:15:00,1907,i put the regular 12 volt lights on mine. i run them on a small 12V gell battery along with my fish finder and my gps and the bilge pump.
