439226,Stoty,2010-03-03 13:09:00,2910,"What does everyone think about the deals so far, as well as the rumors flying around?!?  Sounds to me like the Leafs just gave away Ponny to the Penguins. Thoughts?"
439230,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-03 13:19:00,2690,"Just heard about that one, Jamie...he'll probably score 40 goals in Pittsburgh!!"
439231,jediangler,2010-03-03 13:33:00,1923,"It won't matter what line Poni is on in Pittsburgh, he'll have a better center than he's had in Toronto since Sundin left. Forty is within his reach for sure."
439232,ADB,2010-03-03 13:40:00,444,"Ponikarovsky is a good player, but he'll never score 40 in Pittsburgh.  Even a proven scorer like Guerin hasn't scored 40 playing with Crosby.  In the end, there's only so many goals to go around, and Poni won't be scoring 40 if Sid and Malkin are scoring 50 each.  I'd put him between 25-30, as per usual.  Caputi is a good prospect, and is essentially on par with getting a second rounder.  He has great size as well, and if having a good year in the AHL.  Also consider that they will try to flip Skoula today and get a 4th or 5th round pick.  I wish I wasn't in class today, or I'd have a lovely date with my couch..."
439233,ADB,2010-03-03 13:42:00,444,"However, I also expect it to be a relatively quiet day in terms of trades, unless something comes totally out of nowhere."
439254,anders,2010-03-03 15:06:00,1168,its boring...all this hype for minor league deals.
439266,Mike Pike,2010-03-03 15:39:00,1332,"I gotta agree with Anders.  TSN promotes this as a day to take off work and watch their coverage all day, but no matter how exciting they keep telling me it is, it's not!!!  I'd rather just tune in the end of the day and have 'em recap the deals.  Takes all of a minute and a half."
439267,southpaw24,2010-03-03 15:41:00,32,well its usually after noon or 1pm when all the trades come pouring in and really there isnt that many big name players to be moved
439286,anders,2010-03-03 16:34:00,1168,it should be on from 2pm to about 6...all this crap before hand is useless till then....    Wow...maybe i should say what i really feel...lol
439300,capt bruce,2010-03-03 17:05:00,820,"Ducks trade Pogge and 4th to Carolina for Ward , still nothing for the leafs.. oh wait just in Martin Skoula to jersey for 5th , big deal ??"
439302,ADB,2010-03-03 17:10:00,444,"As predicted, the Leafs traded Skoula to the NJDs for a 5th round draft pick, effectively making yesterday's trade Ponikarovky for Caputi and a 5th."
439306,Harrison,2010-03-03 17:17:00,2202,"Just in, whole leaf team to Pittsburg for Crosby, Burke's bringing the Marlies up to play with him.  Trying for a playoff run."
439341,[email protected],2010-03-03 19:02:00,97,The day has been preeeeety darn boring IMO..only surprise thus far is the wolski trade to Phoenix... I feel a huge storm coming in though...one hour remaining and I'm curious to see where Ray Whitney is headed to and if SJ will do the unthinkable and trade away their numero uno goalie Nobakov for Roloson...  Sadly i have a class to go to and will miss the final half hour...  Hope BM doesnt make any silly trades for the Sens..  Cheers!
439347,diggyj,2010-03-03 19:32:00,548,The TSN tradecentre APP for the iPhone is awsome. Sends you push notifications the minute a deal goes down.  Dirk
439349,Slop,2010-03-03 19:34:00,151,Nothing short of a yawnfest as far as my HABS are concerned. Too bad to see Toronto give up a half decent player like Pondfullofcrappie.
439379,kickingfrog,2010-03-03 20:32:00,8333,Speech from the throne is on as well you know.
439580,[email protected],2010-03-04 03:53:00,97,"Whitney an Oiler?!! Fitting end to one of the most boring trade deadline days since I got hooked on hockey.  Did any of the current playoff contenders get any stronger?? What do you guys think?  Also..dont mean to poke at the leafs but who's left on the the team other than Kessel, Phaneuf and Kaberle??"
439631,Stoty,2010-03-04 11:52:00,2910," For sure they did.  New Jersey with getting Kovalchuk, is HUGE. They are the best defensive team in the league to start with, and adding a 50 goal scorer just makes them an even bigger threat!  Pittsburgh also added a lot of depth to their already strong lineup as well with adding Ponni and Leopold. The East is going to be a TOUGHT conference to come out of this year! Pitts, Washington and New Jersey could all come out!  Also, kudos to Phoenix, they really improved their team!"
439638,daryl0815,2010-03-04 12:20:00,225,"I have to say, I think Toronto didnt really get enough for Poni in my opinion, he will definitely do better in Pittsburgh, having said that I dont really know much about Luca Caputi, from what I hear he is a decent prospect, but without much NHL experience. As for the other guys the Leafs got I have no clue who they are, Chris Peluso and Matt Jones.  I definitely think that Washington, Pittsburgh and NJ have improved, they should all be cup contenders.  I was a little surprised that no goalies were moved to teams like Washington or Philly.  All in all a fairly boring day, I guess with the salary cap, big moves cant be made the way they used to."
439680,Dutchy,2010-03-04 15:05:00,416,"It was boring, but alot of the top players are tied up on massive contracts now so moving them is almost impossible. Plus what you would have to give up to get them would probably kill your team."
439692,Rizzo,2010-03-04 15:45:00,4754,perfect...somehow the Leafs managed to get even worse. Man oh man I wish I was a Bruins fan. #1 pick overall the next 2 years!!!
439719,[email protected],2010-03-04 16:44:00,97,"Well the devils, pens and caps were already on the top of the contender list to begin with...the Kovalchuk trade completely skipped my mind but other than that I dont think the Pens and caps have added anything spectacular to their already annoyingly awesome line up...A little depth but nothing that gives them the ultimate edge IMO.  Even though the leafs did crap..I'm hoping that they go on a tear in the next 10 or so and get out of last place just to spoil the Bruins chances of getting the 1st overall.."
