438886,TJQ,2010-03-02 13:37:00,7806,"Thanks!  Those lakers are amazing, I don't know if anyone else knows this, but there are several lakes up here, usually very small,  where the main feed is crayfish.  This leads to a lake trout with meat almost as pink as speckled trout.  The taste of these fish is simply amazing.  I prefer it over pickerel.  Eaten fresh its UNBELIEVABLE."
