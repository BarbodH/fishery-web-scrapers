438022,Leecher,2010-02-28 04:47:00,7832,"Been working on a this since Friday and late this afternoon, had a chance to give them a new look I like this pattern simply because it will be noticeable on the hard surface.....  Here they are    and well balanced    Ultra light    another shot    Enjoy!!! Leechman  ****************************************************************************** UPDATE    Personalized  "

438033,bassdreamer,2010-02-28 11:07:00,128,Awesome looking tip-ups Leechman !!!!you ever think of selling them ?
438036,Terry,2010-02-28 11:32:00,14456,man those are great looking
438038,phiphntek,2010-02-28 12:08:00,115,nice looking rigs !!
438041,Leecher,2010-02-28 12:21:00,7832, Thanks bassdreamer!!!  Yes I thought about it but for now just a hobby   Thanks Terry!!!   Thanks phiphntek!!!
438072,e-z-out,2010-02-28 14:18:00,1052,I'll put in an order for 2 once the hobby is over
438084,kickingfrog,2010-02-28 14:50:00,8333,Thet do look good enough to sell.
438097,Handlebarz,2010-02-28 15:37:00,3790,they sure do look nice the only thing I might suggest to change is only paint one end orange that way you will not get confused if the tip up is down. I had my old ones painted kinda the same different colors red/green and changed it so that just the top was green so that I knew when the fish was on.  Other then that they look great and I like the idea of having the extra holes to change your position of the pin great work as always
438280,archie_james_c,2010-02-28 21:56:00,618,  I'd buy one as well if you can paint my OFC Username onto it all nice and spiffy like
438477,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-01 02:00:00,709,jaques great work man!  i might have a side project for you!  a ice rod holder.  a bracket that will hold my ice rods horisontal.  and when a fish strikes the tip goes down center with the hole .  bock of the drag on the spool and the fish pull the line free spool.  once you get to your rod. tight the drag and set the hook.  this way you fight the fish on rods.......  you know were im going with this?
438480,Fishing 24/7,2010-03-01 02:03:00,709,something like this!  
438579,LucG,2010-03-01 13:38:00,779,Nice Leechman. I've been thinking of doing somethng similar myself.  Question: Why is the rear part of the horizontal stick offset? Is this for line or for balance?  Good job!
438616,Leecher,2010-03-01 15:54:00,7832, Thanks AILE GOBY!!!  I'll keep that in mind   Thanks Rob!!!  Almost done   Thanks MrEh!!!  The extra holes are for adjusting the sensitivity of the top depending on the species you're targetting..... couple that with reels that have drag knob brings sensitivity to another level Thanks for your suggestion on the color pattern   Thanks archie!!!  I'll also keep that in mind   Thanks Kev!!!  I know where you're going with this..... it's doable.... thinking retractable wooden holders for ease of transportation   Thanks LucG!!!  This is the only design I made that would make a top look different from others that are simply straight.... it's main purpose is for installing a plastic reel    balance comes from the 10 holes that I drilled into it
438676,LucG,2010-03-01 20:17:00,779,ahhh I see Thanks
