252573,Rich,2008-09-25 10:04:00,3927,Salmon run's the best I've seen in a while on the Lake Erie tribs. Ours are about 98% natural with 2% strays from the US.
252624,canadadude,2008-09-25 14:38:00,769,"Salmon hit in the rivers due to aggresion, they are not feeding only protecting the area there in. It dosn't really matter much to me why, as long as they hit.  As far as runs go this year has been dismal to say the least, at dams a few fish jumping may give the impression there are lots but in reality the numbers are way way down from previous years"
252787,Paulus,2008-09-26 01:56:00,522,"Thank GOD I haven't been able to get out much. I'd be chewing my own shirt off my back in frustration.  And, by the way, as soon as the fish cross the line from the lake to the estuary, they stop eating completely.  (Did I just say that?   DOH!!)  p.-"
252795,CLofchik,2008-09-26 02:09:00,854," Ontario has never stocked any chinook into Erie, the US used to stock Dunkirk & the Catt but stopped putting kings in years ago.  There hasn't been any Kings stocked in Erie since 1997.  Though lot's are being caught, they're either strays that have colonized rivers, or even Huron stocked fish that have come down in a search for food."
252893,Rich,2008-09-26 14:55:00,3927,Cool! Interesting to know. There must be a little natural reproduction at least because there are a couple of creeks I know which get pretty good (nothing in comparison to lake O) returns every year.  Another interesting thing is the pink salmon... where the heck do they come from?
252906,12footspringbok,2008-09-26 16:16:00,459,From what understand the pink salmon were accidentaly stocked in to lake superior many years ago. They have managed to naturally reproduce and spead into all of the great lakes. Actually saw one of those ugly buggers in the notty last year.
252428,CLofchik,2008-09-24 19:50:00,854," I'm old enough (and travel to the states enough) to know what lot's of fish are, your idea of ""plenty"" and mine are a bit different.  The # of returns doesn't jibe with stocking, those fish are coming from somewhere.  The MNR says there's alot of natural reproduction to justify not stocking, most guys with alot of rod time have a gut instinct that most are Yankee table scraps.  The irony being the fin clipping you are talking about that will definitively answer this question in four years wouldn't be possible without NYS loaning multi-million dollar equipment to Ontario this spring for a week.   Salmon are migratory, just because fish are caught off Port Credit in July doesn't mean they won't be across the lake in September.  There's lot's of big fish entering rivers.......just not in Ontario.  That 2% number has been bandied about for 20 years, and now is generally thought to be way off.  Don't forget that's also including fish stocked in rivers that have ZERO reproduction (i.e. chinooks in the Credit are not allowed above the Streetsville dam, essentially reducing their chances of spawning to nil, and I don't think there's too many spawning infront of the Burlington Lift Bridge).  Here's a link to a 2005 MNR funded study that's part of the current research into reproduction, in the rivers out East there's ALOT of reproduction happening.  But even in the best case over half the fish returning are stocked fish..........returning to rivers where NONE were stocked.  Those mystery fish have to be coming from somewhere, and it sure as heck isn't Ontario hatcheries......errrr hatchery.   http://www.zoo.utoronto.ca/lakeontario/research.htm    So one run of fish and a few days of decent fishing over five weeks is a good season to you?  Off Bronte there's only been three days of decent fishing in the last five weeks, usually only the 3-4 hours it takes for a run to work itself past the pier and up the river.  The rest of the time it's a vast desert wasteland, if there's two fish landed in the entire harbour all night that's a good night.  Credit isn't doing any better, Oshawa is barren compared to the last two years, I got lucky at Dalhousie and caught one run but the rest of time I haven't seen a single fish landed.......usually at dawn even if you weren't catching anything there would be atleast fish surfacing SOMEWHERE on the horizon.  Instead it's just a vast open barren lake.  There's a few fish trickling in here & there but the East & West runs are pretty much over, and it's been a sad sad season any way you cut it.  Dalhousie is still going to pick up in the next week or two, but I'm not expecting much.  That pretty much leaves the Niagara, which are all Yankee fish."
252441,kemper,2008-09-24 20:20:00,2232, I had a night where between 5 people at the mouth over 25 salmon were hooked (Floating Skein)  And although Im not in Oshawa anymore I have heard from buddies of mine that there is still hot fishing at night (like 2 am night)  Which leads me to think that there is still some fish that have yet to run.  Fish oshawa often?  We have probably run into each other at some point
252449,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-24 20:46:00,3761," Is that true, lol. I have not heard that before."
252451,xrap,2008-09-24 20:51:00,683,"There's lots of salmon down at the wp, they were jumpign liek crazy last time"
252460,Wild,2008-09-24 21:13:00,704,"I checked out the mouth of etobicoke creek just for the halibut and did see a nice sized salmon porpoising around on the shady side, went up to the old dam and figured I would see a few. Oh well that was a waste of time  well until two chicks flashed me on the path --- WOOHOOO!  when I returned to where the salmon was it  was already on it's side and gasping it's last few breaths, all that and ready to die alone without doing the nasty?  Awwww   Oh and is the salmon run over? Naw give it more time."
252464,kemper,2008-09-24 21:17:00,2232," Well im risking starting a cage match in a thread that is going fairly well so Ill try to keep both sides happy in explaining.  YES AND NO is the answer.  A fish that is fresh into the river (ie, the one that you caught) will readily take bait. The only question in that is whether it is biting out of hunger to actually consume the bait or biting out of instinct. Some say that salmon will hit eggs just to destroy them so their own young have a better chance of survival (personally I dont believe this theory).  Salmon that are decaying/dead and USUALLY not going to bite anything (and why would we want them to?) These fish are spawned out and likely near the end of their life. Catching them would probably kill them anyways.  General consensus is that fresh fish will hit FOR SURE in the lower sections of the river, why they hit and if they are actually eating is left to be debated. Fish that are not fresh/decaying/spawned out USUALLY will not hit, although I have landed many Chinooks in late october early november that are pretty beat up and have hit roe patterns. Also, if you are in clear water and you can sneak up on a salmon in a shallow run (PLEASE dont do this to a spawning pair) toss an unweighted pink worm or white worm into the water above it and watch what happens when it gets to the salmon. THEN tell me that salmon in the tribs dont bite. [this only works if the fish isnt spooked and you can manage to see it without it seeing you]  Seriously try it, its wicked cool to watch a salmon SLAM a bait in shallow water, just becareful because its easy to snag/line a fish in low water and that is not something you want to do (I Hope). If you are testing my theory please watch your line and get the hook the hell out of there if it looks like you are going to end up with a snagged fish."
252476,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-24 21:56:00,3761, Im not sure if i will try it this year but possibily next year. Thanks for the info:) .
