Fish mostly the great lakes and the kawarthas/Simcoe.  I noticed they had two differnt types.. MARINE maps which has a Great lakes and maritmies map set and I also noticed a navionics Hotmaps premium for Canada.  What do you have?  Thanks all."

I don't fish the great lakes, but it does well for the inland waterways that I visit - notably Nipissing.  I fish the French River a few times each year, which is not on any these chips.   To get around that, I purchased MapCreate Canada and made my own maps.   Thye work OK for navigation, but it only shows the contours.  I can still save my trails, Waypoints, and ICONS and such, and that's about as good as it gets for me with the Map Create 6."

I am sure Navionics must have something new coming out for next year if there is a $50 rebate offer, but I checked out the lake list and it covers all the lakes I intend to fish for the foreseeable future"
