Military sports is Big out West with 1 Brigade ( Western Soldiers) participating in a Brigade sports Competion (AKA Srong Contender) once a year for a week in the Winter.  It is also highlights for the Edmonton, Winnipeg Sports News casts.  One of the sports is Broomball which is the only contact sport.  However the PPCLI developed a sport which they call Broom-A-Loo.  Its broomball with no rules, little protective clothing and full contact.  On their own sports days its a tradition for the Officers vs the Men and it is rough.  I actually played a game which I had been invited and witnessed an Officer getting a stick in the head and being carried out by the medics while the game carried on.  Anyways heres a game that as a soldier Id like to share.  Of note there are some awesome war footage of YOUR Canadians if you U Tube Canadians fighting in Afghanistan.  For the rock em sockem fans enjoy.    "

If your offended by foul Language or aggressiveness go back to your computer games otherwise see what your brothers are doing.  In my opinion, keep fighting in Hockey, and out of Peace keeping operations otherwise we will get complacent and rolled all over  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niwF6TEsw5w...feature=related"
