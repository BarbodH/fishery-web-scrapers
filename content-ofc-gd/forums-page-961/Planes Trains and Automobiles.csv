243241,fishnsled,2008-08-25 14:49:00,3520," I couldn't agree with you more Dan.  There certainly is a lot of ""magic"" here on the board.  Thanks for the great report."

243335,Zubris21,2008-08-25 20:04:00,563,The colour on some of those sunset shots is amazing!  what kind of camera/lense were you using?  any photoshoping involved?
243362,Dutch,2008-08-25 21:58:00,831,Great report - good to see a bunch of great OFC's getting together to outsmart a bunch of nice trout!
243366,Terry,2008-08-25 22:08:00,14456,great report and pictures  looks like it was a fantastic trip
243367,scuro,2008-08-25 22:12:00,386,"Awesome report, nice pics and some really nice fish Dan. I'm gonna fish that lake if it kills me!"
243530,b2kptbo,2008-08-26 14:28:00,1505,"Was waiting for this one, did look like a fantastic trip, great repot and pictures, thanks..."
243713,tjsa,2008-08-27 00:31:00,1578,"Completely forgot about those guys showing up. I was supposed to go fishing with buds on Saturday, but suffered a hand injury, I could have drove up there for a few hours though, oh well."
243739,Guidofisherman,2008-08-27 01:57:00,206,"I loved the storyline and the photos to go with it. Super job! I just missed you guys by a few hours, but did get to hear the plane take off from the camp site. I'm glad the OFC members finally got to experience Nipigon Brookies. I had to leave the lake early as my motor broke (again) right in front of your camp and I didn't get to stop in at the site. Great report Dan. Alan"
244159,Moosebunk,2008-08-28 13:03:00,3970,Great seeing/meeting ya Dan and thanks for everything.  We boys certainly enjoyed the visits from you and Wayne.  Just in the door here and will have a report up over the weekend.
244379,danc,2008-08-29 00:52:00,4677,"  Glad to hear that you made it home OK Moosebunk. You've got your work cut out for you as far as reports go. I know that your number 1 priority is seeing your girls. You mentioned that several times while we were fishing. You've got your priorities right for sure. I'm sure that it's great to be home.  We'll have to do this once again some time. In fact, I'm sure that you already know that we will. Tie up them jigs just a tad shorter. You know what I mean. It was a pleasure Bud. I'll see you at the camp site sooner rather than later.  To the others that replied to this thread, Thanks so much. I enjoyed sharing this special weekend with all of you."
244381,BillM,2008-08-29 00:57:00,17367,"If there was ever a post to be jealous of, this would be it!"
244424,Ramble,2008-08-29 04:17:00,713,Great Report  Looks like you fella's had a blast. Those Brookies are gorgeous...  -R-
253026,irishfield,2008-09-27 04:37:00,26272,"Thanks for the great recap Dan and the hospitality (let alone the brand new tent!)!!! It was an unforgetable experience and the fishing was great too LOL !! I'd fish with any of the 4 involved anytime.  Spending 19 hours stuck in Marathon though was a tad much for me and I could care less if I see the place again. Thank god the lads were stuck there with their Bell 407 as well, for conversation, and also had something to do/get dirty with (tore all the covers off and helped do an annual inspection on it with the AME riding in it). That and the flight from Chapleau to Marathon that I can't even write about or TC would pull my licence..........  Hopefully I find the time before heading back up North, after Thanksgiving, to get my reports together. Have over 1500 pics from May until Sept 22 to go through and 200 alone from the Temagami to Nipigon to Temagami 4 days ! Right now it's a scamble to get to Montreal by diner on Sunday with Dano."
243050,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-25 01:42:00,957,Thanks for great report and photos.  What more could you ask for on a fishing outing?

243145,Ron,2008-08-25 10:51:00,1683,"Oh man! What a year to miss out on Nipigon. I have fished with Irish and can attest to what a great experience that is. Fishing with Moosebunk would also be an honour I am sure. Looks like you guys hit the water pretty close to prime time. If only I could get there next week, bummer.  Great report DanC, I see Buttcrackus Island made it in the background a few times.... ha ha ha  Cheers, Ron..."

243165,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-08-25 11:57:00,1362,Nice report!!.....those trout are beautiful!!
243174,Roy,2008-08-25 12:07:00,13728,Arguably the most beautiful fish in Canadian waters. You guys did super. There must have been some pretty good campfire stories going back and forth. I've been waiting for this one Dan and you sure didn't disappoint. Thanks for letting us tag along on your adventure.
