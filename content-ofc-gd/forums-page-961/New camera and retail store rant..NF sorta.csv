I'm sure if a demanded a mgr. a flyer wouldn't be necessary, but I'm generally in there on weekends and waiting for the on-duty mgr. can take a while so a flyer is the way to go.  Anyone know of any other chains with ""regional pricing""?"
252814,bigugli,2008-09-26 02:55:00,6138,"Take a look at every grocery store or garden centre or lumber yard. Regional pricing provides a very comfortable margin to cover freight costs, etc... Other chains may keep a chain wide price. It just means that the stores closer to point of supply have pricing that helps offset higher price costs in more remote areas. Either way the customer pays. After all a business exists to make money, not lose it."
252816,ctdd2006,2008-09-26 02:59:00,531,small price to pay for living in god's country I guess!
252869,Greencoachdog,2008-09-26 13:13:00,8163,"Buy online! Save $$$, time, and gasoline!!!   That's what I'm talkin' about!!!"
252227,Roy,2008-09-23 23:31:00,13728,"Y'know.... I reckon that if a company wants to price match, it means that they would have been selling the product for more in the first place. Why then would you not buy the product from the company who had the best price in the first place? Am I missing something?"
252238,mikethespike,2008-09-24 00:11:00,51,"sorry to hear about your experience,  i can assure you tho, that s5is is 1 sweet camera.  i've had mine almost a year now and i've enjoyed using it whenever i can.  i think i got mine when it was $ 339 at canadacomputers.  it came with a free 1gb card which is not much.  i got a 4gb sdhc card for it and wished i got the 8gb instead since i don't want to keep transfering pix over a lot."
252250,Beats,2008-09-24 01:17:00,543, I'm always amazed that so many ppl have never figured this out.  It's fairly well known.  Must be great to play price wars with yourself and always win.
252376,bigfish1965,2008-09-24 15:12:00,3382,"I wasn't going around to save 40 bucks. I was just trying to buy the thing. FS started the mess by putting an item on sale that they didn't have instock, so it was a matter of ""now that I'm out shopping i will go find one"". I don't have a Henry's or smaller camera store in my area..big box stores pushed them all out. Walmart goofed by agreeing to a price then balking at the last minute. I was buying it either way. But to make a deal then back out says all I need to know. And I need Walmart?? Hardly. They are done.  Now that I know FS and BB are the same thing (should have suspected that) gonna have to find another option."
252380,kentooley,2008-09-24 15:40:00,208,"Crappy Tire doe's it all the time!! It seems almost every time I need something in their flyer, it's sold out! Last time it was a rice cooker...got there at 8am and none to be had. I took the display model to the cashier(no box or paperwork,and told her someone on the floor said it was ok. Big deal...it was only 10 bucks I think.) It's a way to get you in the store and then spend you're hard earned money on something else. I think it's perfectly legal if that display model is still there."
252525,Rich,2008-09-25 01:26:00,3927,"Not really Future Shop's fault that the shipment never came.  I hate that, when we have meat on sale and people whine and complain to ME when the stupid truck driver's don't bring us what we ordered a WEEK in advance. I try to explain that to them as nicely as possible how we're just as PO'd as they are because we have to hear about it from customers all day, some people just can't be pleased. Ya know what, go to a butcher shop and get it then and see how much you pay. For now just take my gawd dang rain check. GRRRRR  Okay, not related, but in the same way it is.  Anyway, glad you finally got your camera at least. lol"
252630,bbog,2008-09-25 15:19:00,665,You gotta learn to play the game. FS and BB are the same but have different sales. Each will price match the other and give an additional 10% of the difference. SO.... when you find a sale item in one flyer go to the other store. 1. It will more likely be in stock and 2. It will be cheaper than the sale price.  As for CTC. Some stores are good and others not. When you figure out which then getting the sale items is not a problem.
252639,bigugli,2008-09-25 16:05:00,6138,"I gave up on the big box electronics stores. I find most of the staff as useful as teets on a chicken. It's like buying tackle at CTC or Walmart. If you're really lucky the staff in sporting goods might know a little about hockey. Other than that you are SOL. On top of that, the pricing at a big box is not always cheaper."

252643,ctdd2006,2008-09-25 16:40:00,531,"watch for CTC and their ""regional"" pricing.   Here in Elliot Lake because we have a small store our prices (in the flyers too!) are up to 15% higher here than let's say Sudbury (1.5 hrs away) or even Espanola 1hour away and a town a third of our size!  That drives me nuts!  Crazy thing is if I bring in an on-line flyer from a CTC in a different postal code my store will match the price but I have to bring in the printed version of the flyer!"
252651,wuchikubo,2008-09-25 17:04:00,1114,"Sorry to hear about the runabout that FS and WM played on you.  I had a similar incident earlier this year when I went in for an Apple wireless keyboard and then was given the run around by FS saying the price I found by a shop down the road was not an ""authorized dealer"" but a ""distributor"". Needless to say I went down the road a 5 min trip to SIG electronics and paid about 60% of what FS was having on sale.  Glad to hear you got your camera though."
252667,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-25 18:36:00,957,Most of my purchases are made on-line and a brown truck delivers them.  My blood pressure is usually around 132 over 67.   Pretty good for an overweight geezer.
252669,BillM,2008-09-25 18:40:00,17367,  All they have to do it look it up in the system under a different store number.  It's funny you have to bring in a flyer!!!
