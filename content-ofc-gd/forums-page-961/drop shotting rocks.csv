253068,ultraman18,2008-09-27 15:27:00,4,"+1 to the Strikezone baits they work really well, but the tail part seems to get chomped off pretty quickly  no complaints from me though"
253090,Mark Kulik,2008-09-27 17:55:00,348,"Thank Ultra, unfortunatly the tail is one of the triggering features, thats one of thr reasons I've come up with the fat version, good triggering but more panfish resistance, on some bodies of water like Erie ,Simcoe  it doesn't seem to be as many panfish, on the kawarthas , however the fat slammer will help ."
253096,dharapiak66,2008-09-27 19:15:00,6,when i dropshot for walleye i always use a jig instead of just a sinker. this way i can tip the dropshot hook with something different and you see what the flavour of the day is. it works great.
252186,ecmilley,2008-09-23 22:12:00,2163,"Well I just had a week off work and spent what time i could in the boat when it wasn't blowing like mad on the lake. with all the unstable weather the last week getting fish to co-operate was a bit tough, but with some expert advice I used drop shotting most of the week and was surprised at the amount of fish I got into, the big fish for me of the week was a 21 inch smallie  (no camera that day go figure) tons of 1 and 1.5 lbers kept me amused. Also did the Gulp versus strikezone tourny baits, If you like drop shotting those strikezone baits were outfishing gulps easily 2 to 1 awesome action. hers's a couple pics of some fish anyway.  decisions decisions  little guys  even little skis like strikezones  another toothy critter  same fish diff angle "
252187,Terry,2008-09-23 22:17:00,14456,got to love drop shotting
252195,Roy,2008-09-23 22:27:00,13728,You did real good. Thanks for sharing.
252203,Streamerguy,2008-09-23 22:40:00,121," I think you have an addiction      lol  Nice report,thanx for sharing  cheers Streamerguy"
252229,Mark Kulik,2008-09-23 23:41:00,348,"Hi Ernie thanks for the kudos, glad they are working well for you, Karl and I just got back from a  day drop-shotting with slammers also we caught over 20 smallies with a 6lber karl caught on a ledge in 3 fow , I'll post a pic when he sends it to me, I noticed the walleye too, a lot of anglers are starting to find that walleye love a drop-shot rig too, we'll have to give them a good workout with Shaun in Oct. talk soon Mark  PS streamer guy-I wont post pics of my collection you'll think i'm nuts!  LOL"
252297,Cudz,2008-09-24 03:35:00,2652,Not to hijack this thread but I was wondering where I can get yout strikezone stuff Mark.  Is it only available online?  I live in Barrie and would like to pick it up rather than have it sent.
252331,bucktail,2008-09-24 12:33:00,1857,"Now thats a selection of drop shotting tackle.  1 question, do you think the Strikezone out fished the gulp because its more pliable and thus has a more natural action?  I find the gulp a little too rigid, just wished it was softer.   Darren"
252341,ecmilley,2008-09-24 13:13:00,2163,"http://www.strikezonetournamentbaits.com/dealerlocator.htm   looks like you will have to order cudz, no dealer close to you.  Bucktail personlly I think that the  slammers have a much more natural action for the finesse fishing that dropshotting is these things squirm dance and vibrate with the least amount of input, where the gulps smell good but like you said arn't very pliable and seem to require a more jigging like action than a twitching"
252344,legacey,2008-09-24 13:19:00,127,"In the last bass tournament I fished, I drop shot rigged for the majority of it. honestly, and stupidly,    this was the first time I've tried this presentation and out fished my partner big time.  Even caught about a 6 lb walleye too.  Cheers,  Paul"
252349,Mark Kulik,2008-09-24 13:33:00,348,"Hi Cudz simcoe bait and tackle on innisfil street in barrie carries strike zone baits if there's a color they don't have or you require bulk order let them know i can have them there within a day or two i have a lot of friends that have been out fishing their partners that have being using other techniques by as much as thirty to one at times, while drop shotting is considered an advanced technique it really shouldn't be because its quite simple to use check out the article i wrote in luresandtours.com fact of the matter is my kids and beginning anglers i take out catch a lot of big fish drop shotting give it a try and i know it will work for you."
252355,BillM,2008-09-24 13:48:00,17367,"Mark, my dad and I recently tried drop shotting for the first time out on Go Home Lake a few weeks ago.  It was quite fun, caught all kinds of fish!!  I think I'll give those baits a try!  I'll let you know how it works out  BTW, would you recommend going with a bigger bait now that the fish are on the fall feedbag?"
252356,bucktail,2008-09-24 13:48:00,1857,"Going to have to give them a try. I dont dropshot much but I should, too much fishing ADD and lack of confidence with it. Thanks Mark maybe I will stop in there tomorrow on my way up to the cottage and pick up a couple bags."
252358,Leecher,2008-09-24 13:59:00,7832,Great report and pics ecmilley  Thanks for sharing Leechman
252374,Mark Kulik,2008-09-24 15:00:00,348,"Hi Bill, the fat slammer has been working well, I made it to give more bulk, and bigger baitfish in the fall, they have been producing well, Simcoe bait have the regular slammers, I can them som Fat slammers if you like, yesterdat we caught our fish on Couch on regular slammers, the fat ones are also better when a lot of small panfish are present, they don't get the tail bit as much. Hope they work well for you bucktail, Fishing world , JB's and Gagnons also carry them.  feel free to pm me if you need tips or info, always happy to help."
252399,Cudz,2008-09-24 18:06:00,2652,Thanks Mark. I will go and see Lou tomorrow. Brown colour?  or would you go with something that is a bit lighter?
252413,Mark Kulik,2008-09-24 18:52:00,348,"Hi Cudz, this is just my personal preference, but I've done great on Simcoe and Couch as well as other clear bodies of water with smoke, yesterday we used straight smoke 202 and smoke shiner 204, which is two-tone they both worked , smoke /copper , smoke red  etc..  one thing I noticed yesterday is the fish hit the 2-tone real hard, usually they just pick it up but yesterday a couple tried to jerk the rod out of my hand! in the fall I've had good success on Gr.pumpkin as well as watermelon shades."
252556,Cudz,2008-09-25 03:27:00,2652,sold.  I will have one of each and give it a try this weekend and buy more of the one that works best. thanks. Sorry about the thread hijack ecmilley
252585,ecmilley,2008-09-25 12:38:00,2163,  It's all good
252636,jwl,2008-09-25 15:53:00,1056,"nice fishin there...great way to catch fish on a nice day, we just boated a tonnes of fish the last couple days too this way..mixed bag of smallies,eyes,perch, of course sunnies   . Sounds like you had a great time on the water."
252716,CLofchik,2008-09-25 21:21:00,854,"How do you use those line grabbing ""dropshot"" sinkers? What's the point to those instead of just a good ol' bell sinker, or even just pegging a bullet sinker on the tag end?"
252717,splashhopper,2008-09-25 21:23:00,2931,
252737,Mark Kulik,2008-09-25 22:44:00,348,"just to answer the weight question-you could use a bell weight or split shot, the clip on is good because itr has a built in swivel which helps line twist also you can re-position the hook to weight distance without re-tyinging, if you get snagged you lose only the weight."
252839,singingdog,2008-09-26 10:24:00,1047,"The other thing to use for a weight is a jig. It's not as easy to reposition as the snag-on weights, but covers more water. It's a great way to figure out if the fish are keyed on suspended food or bottom feeding. The occasional double-header is entertaining."
252909,ecmilley,2008-09-26 16:37:00,2163,"I stopped by Gagnons after work Thursday and they have recently been restocked with the strikezone baits if anyone is intrested, my wallet takes a pounding in that store but i got some cool colours"
253056,Jer,2008-09-27 13:42:00,1426,I found myself in Oshawa yesterday as well and stopped at Gagnons and picked up a pack of 'slammers' in watermelon/red fleck.  Tried them out last night on a drop-shot rig and in about an hour I had three small bass and a crappie. No size to the fish but more than I caught the night before on Chemong in about 3 hours on my senko.
