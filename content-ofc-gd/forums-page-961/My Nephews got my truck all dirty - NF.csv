252649,BillM,2008-09-25 16:55:00,17367,Looks like fun!  Nothing like getting a truck all dirty..  Needs more diesel though
252656,silveradosheriff,2008-09-25 17:47:00,1025, Can't say I'd be too motivated to drive her through the bush for some trout....  
252658,Disspatcher,2008-09-25 18:14:00,73,Cameraman musta followed him in with his Ford Focus!   j/k nice truck.
252665,silveradosheriff,2008-09-25 18:31:00,1025,There were some quality spots - but given the fact that my Nephews are teenagers and the truck is brand new....wasn't going to happen!  :-)
252673,Disspatcher,2008-09-25 18:48:00,73,Smart kids...dont blame them a bit!
252674,blaque,2008-09-25 18:51:00,2419,"i hope the camera man was using the zoom and not actually that close to a speeding truck coming at him and turning in the slop lol. That is fun, ive got my second F-150 and its pretty new (and black) so thats about as far as i go with it as well, its not hardcore, but its fun none the less. (steelhead season is coming, and to get back on the reservation down here in new york.......i have to drive thru some pretty bushy trails, i can hear the branches screetching down the side of my truck already like nails on a chalkboard) They rub out pretty easy though with some 3M products"
252722,Mattones,2008-09-25 21:38:00,587,My Mazda 626 LX has more dirt on it. lol The construction site is horrible for dirt flying around after someone drives by. The back of the car is a dark brown and must be 1/8 thick i had to clean the back window before coming home today:P  Today I shall clean it as its almost been a week. haha
252958,iceguy,2008-09-26 20:15:00,341,Nice video Rod! Lets get into some back woods speckie lakes with her now.
253021,Greencoachdog,2008-09-27 02:38:00,8163,We have a red clay that is slicker than snot on a glass door knob and sticks like Napalm when it gets wet down here.
253034,jediangler,2008-09-27 08:47:00,1923,You better get that truck all washed off before Sunday's hockey. You wouldn't want Frank to see how you treat your Tundra.
253046,Casey123,2008-09-27 12:59:00,461, That is awesome!
