We were targetting eyes and boated lots of fish but only two  eyes but both outside of the slot a 22.5 and a 26"".   Beauty fish.   Weird thing, we didn't get any under the 16"" slot but two other parties at the cleaning station only caught under the slot.  Our nice surprise was half a dozen 18"" plus smallies in  30 fow where we got our eyes.....also a pile a perch, some jumbos over 12 inches.   Starting to heat up!   Next week should be better!"

Some nice smallies, and a few pike......lots of eyes. Eyes were taken in one spot in about 20-25 FOW on worm harnesses attached to bottom bouncers.......others were taken in about 10 FOW just off a weed line using spinners and grubs. Most of them were in the slot with 2 being just over and 2 being just under.....found a lot of suspended fish too that wouldnt take anything if you hit them in the head with a lure.....in about 35 FOW....  Feel free to PM me if you want more specifics....."
