252281,Laker272,2008-09-24 02:51:00,45,Hello All. Just wanted to introduce myself to the members who don't know me from the other forums. I have been fishing my whole life thanks in part to my father who had the smarts to put a rod in my hand at a very young age. I have had the opportunity to fish many greeat waters over the years and have enjoyed every one of them no matter what the fish count. I prefer to practice catch and release as I definately like the bite better then the taste. I'm there mostly for the fun of it all. I fish year round and I am the kind of guy who looks forward to the hardwater all summer and counts the days down to the softwater in the winter.LOL. I have met some great guys on some of the other sites and I hope that continues here. Thanks Laker272
