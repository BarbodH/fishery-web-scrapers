Are there any bass around the shoreline right now, have all the weeds and pads died off. Any help and or ideas to help me to catch some bass. I would love to use my topwater snakes this weekend and hammer some largemouths but again not sure if the fish are still there. Thanks in advance for any help.   Mike"
