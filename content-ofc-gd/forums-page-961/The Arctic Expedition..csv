247516,Moosebunk,2008-09-08 00:18:00,3970,"Lew.  I have nothing.  On trips like this they take care of all that stuff.  At home, in the bush, someone always knows where I've gone, and where I may go for a back-up plan, when I plan to return and when Bren or another should panic."
247519,Radnine,2008-09-08 00:41:00,1538,Thanks for that. It was a pleasure to read. Jim

252826,Ramble,2008-09-26 03:51:00,713,Good idea irish....it is goooooooooooood fish porn!  *drool*  -R-
252828,camillj,2008-09-26 04:52:00,1988,"Wow, all I can do right now is book mark it ... and send the link to everyone I know !  Great story and awesome pic's !"
252830,OhioFisherman,2008-09-26 05:25:00,6623,Fantastic pictures and report!
252845,Moosebunk,2008-09-26 11:19:00,3970, Good to see ya back fella.  Place ain't the same without ya.
246853,Smokey,2008-09-05 10:54:00,1278,"Congrats. Would what an adventure you had, looks amazing.  Thanks for posting all the pics and story  Mike"
246903,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-05 13:58:00,241,"Totally epic dude! Great report, stellar pics and some of the raddest fish one could ever hope to land. Congrats man."
246911,Moosebunk,2008-09-05 14:14:00,3970,"  Send them.  I'll post 'em up here.  You guys caught your fair share of beauties too, and I'd bet Shane would be happy to see more in this post once it gets sent to him.  And Raw Legend....... I can only guess who???   PM sent."
246913,Moosebunk,2008-09-05 14:14:00,3970, No Probs.
246917,Moosebunk,2008-09-05 14:28:00,3970," I don't.  It might happen as there's one more planned biggy left in me.  It's been fun and I really enjoy the freedom and practice that comes with writing on the internet.  Peoples enjoyment of the reports is great and even validates that I might just be doing something right and well.  Telling a fishing story this way, by linking the whole experience through words and many pics is exactly how I will want to relive it 10-20-30 years from now when the memory is slipping but the printed story will remain.   Thanks again for all the replies."
246924,cityfisher,2008-09-05 14:39:00,959,amazing as always... you just made my morning:)

Yep, just FREAKING AWESOME!!!! Yet again!!      Thanks a ton for putting that all together, simply AWESOME!  Love those Char pics!   Thanks again Drew."
247103,issamhay,2008-09-06 03:48:00,77,"wow mazing report, how do u get the oppurtunities to go all over canada, those char must be one of the most beautiful animals on Earth"
247107,Mattones,2008-09-06 04:19:00,587,Wow. Just amazing. i have to go.
247135,steverowbotham,2008-09-06 14:18:00,1800," YEAH!  Not to intrude, but what do you do for a living?"
247155,jwl,2008-09-06 15:43:00,1056,"all your fishing reports always have an epic story behind them..man, I envy the type of adventures you get to go on, all the shared trips with your kids, and you are a lucky man that your wife often gets involved in your adventures too.  do you ever need like a ""caddy"" or something in the boat with ya???...you know..someone who can suggest using the 3-iron kind of thing ...what about a camera man"
247169,limeyangler,2008-09-06 16:50:00,5204,"That is truly awesome, lol...i will have to come back and read the rest....but the pics of those Char are absolutely amazing...colors are incredible!!! I am a little jealous too.....especially as i always wanted to catch Grayling from a very young age.   Thanks for sharing."
247183,lunkerbasshunter,2008-09-06 17:35:00,2585,wow man that is one huge report!  The first pic is one of my favorite of all time on this board thanks for that!  The colours on those char are awesome!  Lakers are huge and i cant believe the price of food up there wow!  Thanks for a great report!!!!!!!!!!!  Cheers!
247251,cisco,2008-09-06 23:07:00,597,"Breathtaking report Drew!     Took several stabs at er to finally get it read.  With your wonderful report here on OFC and elsewhere, Plummers really should send something for all the promo............ in fact it sounds like fishing pros go there probably for free while you two pay to go, yet you provide a fantastic report for all to read to show what Plummers is all about.  You my friend really do deserve something for this FANTASTIC article!  All the best to you and your family and thank you again for the report and pics!!!!!"
247263,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-06 23:50:00,0,"Awesome report! Didn't have the time to read it all, but the pictures speak more than a thousand words!Some nice Lakers, and Grayling, but those Char by far steal the spotlight. Absolutely amazing colors on those fish!!!  Also some great scenery shots, but that water fall looks absolutely magnificent!!!!  Thanks for sharing!"
247289,snag,2008-09-07 01:14:00,1932,Brilliant Bunk!  Those beautiful colours remind me of silly-cibin trips.  Your handle with the photography is impressive too!  Thanks again.  
247310,ccmtcanada,2008-09-07 02:36:00,7971,"Wow.  Un-freaking-believable!!!!  After I read your report last year about the BC Sturgeon, I thought that's the best trip anyone can make.  Well, I think what I just read tops that one hands down!!!  Very envious....the stuff of fantasy....something you'd see in a movie...it looks awesome, but it's not real...it's just acting.  You two got to live the stuff of dreams....  Thank you.....thank you....thank you!!!!  Congrats to you and Bren...what a trip!!!"
247325,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-07 04:20:00,1183,"A few days ago I had taken a little peek knowing that I would need to have more than just a few minutes to read your report entirely. My first thought when scanning quickly the pics and seeing the brilliant red colour on the fish was 'poor guy, something happened to his camera'  Fantastic report!!!"
247387,Moosebunk,2008-09-07 14:25:00,3970,"""My first thought when scanning quickly the pics and seeing the brilliant red colour on the fish was 'poor guy, something happened to his camera"" - Twilight  I liked that one.  Witty.   ""Those beautiful colours remind me of silly-cibin trips."" - Snag  Without the got rot on the odd bad trip.   ""YEAH! Not to intrude, but what do you do for a living?"" - Steve  I'm a full time stay at home fisherman.   ""do you ever need like a ""caddy"" or something in the boat with ya?"" - jwl  The tackle bag is getting heavy in my old age.   ""You my friend really do deserve something for this FANTASTIC article!"" - Cisco  My online fees ( $0.00 ) are waaaay to cheap I guess.... and come to think of it, my kids probably deserve something for all my time at the computer.  We're going fishing today then.  See yas.   Thanks again for the great replies all."

What means do you have up there for contacting emergency medical help in-case you need it in a hurry for injury or illness that you can't take care of yourself, specially when your alone on one of your adventures ??  Do you have reliable cell phone use, satellite phone, 2 way radio's ??"
247422,ehg,2008-09-07 17:02:00,2666,"Ditto on the amazing selfless report. Those char have the most intense vivid colouration imaginable. You are blessed. Thanks for sharing, ehg"
246500,cram,2008-09-04 04:09:00,1733,I am soooo blown away.  What a trip.  Wow.
246505,Nemo,2008-09-04 04:46:00,727,MB I read and I am exhilarated. I think this is the most important part.  What a great trip. You did justice in the documentation.  Truly a masterpiece of content and writing skill. You also grabbed the back story on the guide and the history.  You talents are great. Stick to writing Bren is obviously the fisher..  LOL. Bren that Char - wow  Also Plummer's should hire you that was an awesome (1 hour for me) infomercial.  You have set the bar..... congrats  How do you intend to top this?
246510,GBW,2008-09-04 05:19:00,8460,"I read every word in awe when matched to the pic's of the story you told. Like others have said, keep on posting and documenting these events as i am sure you will be rewarded... I THANK YOU! Geoff"
246514,sharper,2008-09-04 06:50:00,279,"Wow that report was just amazing! The pictures were breath taking, I can only imagine being able to experience it myself. Who else to share a fishing trip of a lifetime with, then the significant other."
246516,canadian_copper,2008-09-04 07:06:00,925,AMAZING REPORT!!! BREATH TAKING SCENERY(ESPECIALLY THE RIVER WITH NO ONE ON IT OR SHOPPING CARTS IN IT LOL) AND AMAZING FISH!!! TALK ABOUT A TRIP OF A LIFE TIME FOR MOST AND THATS PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU SEE EVERYDAY  LOL

I could read your reports all day, or even given the chance sit around a campfire and listen to all your stories!   thanks for sharing those amazing pictures and those amazing catches.  thank you!"

Thanks again Drew...... 47 minutes from start to finish, I must admit, like Glen, I ogled those Char shots a little too much for my own good...........  It is a trip that I have been dreaming about for years, now I know that I will make it a reality."
246600,youngvedder,2008-09-04 14:52:00,72,"wonderful report, beautiful pictures, and amazing fish. I truly enjoy your posts so much. they take me out of my office and where I want to be!"

246610,Leecher,2008-09-04 15:36:00,7832,"WOW Bunk.... What an awesome trip. Congratulations to both of you for your PB's on those chars The colors and size are out of this world  The report is very well written with lots of details and pics, truly enjoyed it.   Made me feel I was part of your journey.  Again great job and thank you! Leechman"

246676,Ramble,2008-09-04 18:49:00,713,"Well my friend, you have set the bar a notch higher yet again. I hope i can pull off something half as awesome with the K-Sawg Report which is brewing in my mind. I'm not sure really sure what else i can say. It was a well rounded report. More writting needs to have depth to it like your reports. Good story telling is a dying art in todays world, but by God it's not dead yet!  The quote ""If you take a guy to a place where the environment wraps around him, the inner ego lets go and he can become a part of the land"" hit a personal chord with me. Usually it takes me about a month to get ""back to reality"" after i get out of the north and i could never put into words why.....that is why.   Keep up the good work Duuuude.  -Dave"
246678,kemper,2008-09-04 18:56:00,2232,"Moosebunk you have just completed my number one dream fishing trip, one that is in the works for sometime in the next 5 years with my father. I could not have imagined a better plan then the one you have just reported.  Unbelieveable trip, epic fishing and writing that puts me on the river with you.  If its okay I will be contacting you when I decide I can escape for this trip myself."
246721,Ron,2008-09-04 21:19:00,1683,*Yawn*.....     NOT!  This is where one of my brothers and I are suppose to be going next year. Slight change in plans now and it won't be happening until 2012.

246771,tibbs,2008-09-05 00:11:00,650,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Fantastic report and awesome pics!
246818,Cookslav,2008-09-05 02:23:00,1457,"OMG....That was just bloody awesome. I swear I'd pay money to read that in a magazine, just being 125% honest.  Seriously, I've not read a mag article with pics that good ever.  I've seen and read reports of Large NWT Lakers, but never have I ever seen Char like that! Simply Awesome, Thanks so much for sharing that!!!!"
246842,Raw Legend,2008-09-05 05:43:00,1,"Great shots bud....you know that bottle of single malt wouldn't of lasted an hour in cabin #2.....I should send you a few of our shots. Not near as picturesque, but still make me wish I could do it every year!"

The Graylings were very nice and something you don't see every day!  Those Char though!!!  ... them there things really made my sticker peck out!!! The most beautiful freshwater fish I've ever seen, and Frackin' HUGE TOO!!!  ... gotta get me some ARCTIC CHAR!!!!"
246418,JeffBornFishin,2008-09-04 01:12:00,260,Thanks for the post!  Excellent pics  I would love to go up there some time.  Trip of a lifetime you would never forget
246420,HotelTango,2008-09-04 01:23:00,21,This is in my opinion the best report I have ever seen on this site. Great job and keep up the good work.

246445,solopaddler,2008-09-04 01:49:00,8605,"Just incredible Drew, like Roy said in your previous thread it's getting hard to come up with adjectives to describe your exploits. There's no doubt that male char in their spawning colours are by far the most beautiful fish in freshwater, the fish you guys caught are truely spectacular, big congratulations! Interesting that you mentioned the guy using the float reel on the Tree river. One of my best friends in the world (who I'll be fishing with in 2 weeks  ), lives in Yellowknife and has guided at Plummers and the Tree River camp for years. He's an old river rat originally from Ontario and he consistently slays big numbers of Char using his float rod and centrepin.  Thanks for taking the time to put that together, lord knows it must have taken a while!  Cheers,  Mike"
246448,Musky or Specks,2008-09-04 01:53:00,2710,When I die I want to come back as you. That was an awesome report.
246450,tbayboy,2008-09-04 01:57:00,1497,"Stunning, just stunning Moosebunk.  You have a wonderful knack for both pictures and words and the fact that you get out to some fishing spots the rest of us just dream about only makes it better.  Those char are simply unreal looking fish.  Time to start saving up I think!"

Some of us are always searching and it looks like you found Nirvana, and with your wife to boot! I thought you couldn't enter heaven as a couple.  The Char ....the Char ...beaut photos...great narrative, detail...and then in the middle of the story, one great big belly laugh.  Yeah, I read a paper about that recently in THe Journal of New England Medicine, seems that wallops of lard and ascorbic acid create a very toxic byproduct....I fully understand bro!"
