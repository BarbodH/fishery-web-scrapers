251978,kickingfrog,2008-09-23 01:34:00,8333,"Glen and I got up to Lakair Thursday afternoon, set up camp next to Lew, lunched the boat and hit the water. One of the first spots produced a nice start to 4 days of fishing.  Glen sets on a fish.   Six pound test, medium spinning rod.   And the fish is DEEP in the weeds. After a while the weeds/fish are at the side of the boat for the first time.   After the second attempt to land this pike Glen may have said something along the lines of ""Put down the damn camera and help me!"" But he's too nice. I did however put the camera down and help him land the fish.  A nice 37 inch pike. Did I mention the 6 lb test line no leader and a pile of weeds???   Glens' been at Lakair for less then 2 hours and he's ready to start booking the next trip.  Some release shots...     I had a follow from another nice pike as glen was releasing his fish, but no hook-up.  On we went to explore and look for other spots.  We found a few walleye before heading back to camp for diner.   After we got back to camp we talked to some other OFNers and found out that the fishing had been slow. Good thing we had got out before we knew. As it turned out Thursday was our best day fishing.  Friday we were back at it.  shhhhh, don't tell anybody about this secret spot.   And another spot nobody knows about. I think this one was 25 inches.   Back at camp around the fire I had to take some shots of Dawg's hat. That's Spiel talkin' to him.    I was sure that was dead when we past it on the road???  A nice morning down at the dock.   We also got into some bass.   Lots of fun, and lots of fishing, not as much picture taking though.  See you all next time. "
