252741,Billy Bob,2008-09-25 23:14:00,5865,"I was going to suggest Navionics 2008 Premium Hot Maps because there is a $50 rebate going on until 12/31/08 HOWEVER, I do NOT see Simcoe on the list.  It might be a misprint and a quick email to Navionics will answer that.  Here's the lake list site for you.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/content/...avionics08.html"
252746,brickNblock,2008-09-25 23:29:00,598,"George, I've honestly no experience with the hotmaps but have heard great things about them but that being said I do have the Navionics Gold......and I love it. It  is the GreatLakes version and Maritimes. I llive in Quinte so having the bay and this area is important to me but I also get all the Kawarthas, Lake of the Woods and ...........to there,  as well just about every other water body I normally fish. I find the depths and land/water boundries are quite often incorrect as well  a lot of depths but we get along."
252749,JorgeCarlos,2008-09-25 23:33:00,109,thanks a lot Billy Bob.  George
252757,JorgeCarlos,2008-09-26 00:11:00,109,"thanks brickNblock, i apreciated your input. George"
252794,BillM,2008-09-26 02:08:00,17367,"Some of the HotMaps have been known to be waaay off...  I run the Navionics Gold map, it's been dead nuts on regardless of the body of water...."
252802,skeeter,2008-09-26 02:26:00,1907,according to the guy at lebarons: they have redone the hot maps for 2008 and they have added a lot of new lakes including simcoe kawarthas and bay of quinte thats the 3 i inquired about buckhorn has been corrected also
252940,Billy Bob,2008-09-26 18:17:00,5865,I have the US Eastern States 2008 Premium Hot Spots Maps and so far the mapping on 3 different lakes including Lake Erie has been dead nuts on.  I am ready to purchase the 2008 Canadian chip this week while I have a $20 off coupon from Cabela's plus the $50 rebate plus $85 in Cabela's Bucks. It don't get no better than that
