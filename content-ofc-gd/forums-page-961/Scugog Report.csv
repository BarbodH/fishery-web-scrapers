I only caught 1 bass that weighed 2.7lbs. I caught this fish not far from of 10 feet off shore using one of my Origional Fishing Snakes. I also used a white spinnerbait,rapala husky jerk, some yum dingers and a x-rap shad and i caught nothing, not even a bite! Then i tied on one of my snakes and went to the weedy area's and that is where i got my bass and 2 other good hits. Next time i will put batteries in the camera O well i had a fun time and caught a nice fish!  I am going there again tomorrow, any suggestions or techniques i might want to try?   Mike"
