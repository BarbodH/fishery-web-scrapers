251901,Clampet,2008-09-22 21:15:00,1947,"I came across this article in the Toronto Star this morning.  It is a case of abuse to another human being, I thought the members of this board should be made aware of.  Click Here"
251904,Woodsman,2008-09-22 21:36:00,1286,I also read the same article. No way they could have not known if the story is even remotely correct. Although it is possible the story is completely wrong I doubt it. They won't see any of my money unless I see something convincingly to change my mind.  Rick
251905,danbo,2008-09-22 21:46:00,2646,"As long as there's greed, there will be abusers. I only hope that the Karma of the evil ones is reciprocated later."
251908,ccmtcanada,2008-09-22 22:25:00,7971,I read it today as well...noticed in the comments section that there is another Whispering Pines on Rice Lake that is getting some nasty phone calls and emails.
251909,bbog,2008-09-22 22:29:00,665,There are three sides to every story! If any of this is remotely true then all involved in the exploitation of this poor woman should be SHOT.
251932,chickenhawk,2008-09-22 23:39:00,612,Iunno about this......something seems a lil fishy to me here   Hawk
252017,BillM,2008-09-23 03:53:00,17367,The lodge and the placement company should be shut down..  What a crock of poop this is.
252020,Mike the Pike,2008-09-23 04:04:00,3421,Thats pretty Sad.Thanks for posting Paul
252029,Rich,2008-09-23 09:55:00,3927," My uncle used to run the Whispering Pines on Rice Lake. The new people there are good people, not sweatshop owners, lol"
252040,ketchenany,2008-09-23 11:22:00,3229,"I too read the article and to me it seems like exploitation of this poor woman . . . wonder how many more are being treated the same and nothing is ever heard, sad."
252193,Terry,2008-09-23 22:22:00,14456,I would really like to hear the other side(s) of the story   but if true I would like to see more then boycotting the place  maybe picket the place
252397,LeXXington,2008-09-24 17:58:00,1928,Such a nice spot to visit...  NOT
252411,fishinggeek,2008-09-24 18:48:00,325,"Thanks for bringing it to my attention.  Businesses that don't play fair really tick me off.  Not to hijack this thread, but http://www.ocoa.ca/Pages_MNRnews/index.htm is the conservation officer's association website and they list convictions of individuals and businesses.  You'd be surprised at how many companies have been convicted that one may have dealt with, such as William Kitts, owner of Temagami Marine, who has been convicted 3 times for altering the shoreline.  I suggest a quick browse for companies you may be considering."
252479,Terry,2008-09-24 22:05:00,14456,ok maybe I am still missing something  Shirley Bollers owns  Whispering Pines Lodge is that right and where is anything in a statement or facts about her not just statements from Manuel......  Heron Lloyd Tait of Jinkholm International was the nanny broker and the do have some stuff from her.....so what is it I am missing  so again..if it's true ...it's more then nasty but I like more then a angry ex-employees statement before I convict anyone...call me crazy
252484,Gerritt,2008-09-24 22:49:00,6129,"anyone happen to have an email address? seems there is more then one ""whispering pines""  G"
252492,reddhaute,2008-09-24 23:37:00,1,"I called Whispering Pines because I visit there very often.   It is a clear and simple case of the owner caught up in the misdeads of a bad agency and an immigrant not wanting to return back to her country.  The place is nice and the owner is great.  Basically she took the lady in because a friend that hired her did not require the service.  Then instead of the agency sending her back they asked the employer to find a job for her and she did with her friend at the Inn.  The owner never knew the legalities of the process, and when she told the agency she did not want the service and let the lady go, she then claims she was abused and over worked???  Your right....something smells fishy....easy citizenship!!"
252494,Gerritt,2008-09-24 23:41:00,6129,I would say something is fishy all right.... this being you're first post..  G
252503,Woodsman,2008-09-24 23:55:00,1286,"Although I'm a little suspicious of the whole ordeal, the above statement carries little weight with me from a first time poster. Why this their first post? Damage control? Any business owner that has been in business for anytime would know or should have reasonably known the employment rules.  The above two posts happened while I was typing & cooking supper. But than I only type with two fingers also."
252511,ketchenany,2008-09-25 00:27:00,3229,"  I'm with Girrit on this one, but I'm going to keep looking at this in the paper/news for updates. The Star is not  a rag and probbaly will stand behind what they wrote.  Lets face it, there are people / companies in all industries out there willing to get as much as possible for their money, it will never end knowing very well that few will complain."
252659,icedude,2008-09-25 18:18:00,459,  caught that report as well--sad to be sure--if there is some validity to it all--quite frankly disturbing  i do not have time for this nonsense--is not a response that one would expect on the surface  as far as 'Fishermnsfrds' first post is concerned--how transparent is that--hiding in plain view dude?   have had absolutely no conatct with Whispering Pines Simcoe to date--not--on our US referral list--clearly will never make the grade after this kind of press   Thanks Paul for bringing this to the boards attention   Cheers  Paul
252660,fishinggeek,2008-09-25 18:20:00,325,I concur.  They'll never see a dime from me or my family.  I'm much more inclined to believe a reputable newspaper like The Star than someone posting for the first time.
252755,Rich,2008-09-26 00:07:00,3927,"Hate to play devil's advocate, but how does the amount of posts one makes define whether or not they are a reliable source of information?  I don't have an opinion on the subject either way. I do believe basing judgment on only a newspaper article is very biased. Half the time their information is wrong or embellished."
252769,Ron,2008-09-26 00:36:00,1683,One can only assume this can get cleared up fairly fast simply by one side or the other to produce pay stubs. So I would have to say it's up to Whispering Pines to show this evidence.
252773,Greencoachdog,2008-09-26 00:45:00,8163,"Hard work, long hours, and low pay... welcome to the world of being an immigrant!!!  Did this woman have to work this job?... no!  Should she have spoken up?... yes!  How long would it have taken y'all to figure out this wasn't a babysitting job?.... the first day?  This woman needs to hug her ex-employers neck for just making her do honest work, and teaching her a life lesson!!!  Some female immigrants a forced into much worse lines of ""work""."
