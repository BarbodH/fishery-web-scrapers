253084,Roy,2008-09-27 17:31:00,13728,But is 'anger' the correct word?

253092,irishfield,2008-09-27 18:21:00,26272,"Angry at the crappy ""summer"" weather we had... of course I'll get no tears around here for that! LOL  A/C ran once this summer back in June. Heat was on every night through out the summer to maintain the cottage at 60F. Lost count of the snow/hail/sleet days... and nights down to 2C in AUGUST!  I remember Leah talking with Bly one day in late July or early August. Bly standing in front of her Air conditioner and at the same time I was just lighting the wood stove to dry the place out for Leah.  Speaking of which.. no matter how much I razz Carole/Bly about her weekly to bi-weekly FOUR hour phone calls to Leah......I've got to thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping Leah through a real tough summer.  Stan.. fish porn will have to wait! (and there's not much anyhow.. think we fished 9 times) Gotta a fishing trip to pack for and have to pick Dano up at 9am tomorrow. We'll be back next Friday and then I may get time before heading North again around Thanksgiving. If not it will be late October before I get much up on OFC."
