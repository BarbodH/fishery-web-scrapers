The bite was good with some sizeable fish hitting both spinnerbaits and tubes. This bass ate a tube. 17 inches and 2-2 1/2lbs.    The smallies wanted the spinnerbait.   I didn't even notice this little fella. I just felt him strike at my trouser leg a couple of times. Must be from this year's hatch, just shy of 12""   There is one smallie there that got the better of me twice today. Probably close to the 20"" mark. Took my spinnerbait into a tree to free himself in the morning. Went back to the same spot in the afternoon and he bit off my tube. I'll deal with him later"

I get stuck at home enough already. Right now I'm stewing up another batch of salsa ( like the batch we never cracked open at the trailer) Then I got another bushel of tomatoes dropped off at the house to be processed tonight. My neighbours can smell the cooking walking up the street for a block.
