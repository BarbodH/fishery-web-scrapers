If I can dig up some time this Sunday I was going to take a run down to Scugog and try it out for the first time.  Probably be looking to rent a boat - can anyone give some suggestions on the best rates/availability for someone who doesn't book ahead?  So far I was thinking Westshore out of Port Perry.  And...without giving away any 'honey hole' areas - would there be a generalized area I should maybe head for first instead of chewing up all the rental time hunting for them?  Our main target will probably be Largemouth, but I'm not opposed to the opportunity to take on a musky!  Any and all info appreciated.  Thanks!  B"
