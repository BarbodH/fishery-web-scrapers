252748,Dutch,2008-09-25 23:32:00,831,Nice smallie for sure!
252825,Cookslav,2008-09-26 03:49:00,1457,"Nice day out on the water fer sure!  And that thar is a Fisher.   Lots around these days? I've seen them before in the same habitat, chaseing mice, and birds in the rocks around the Dam At both the Shand Dam (Belwood lake) and Pittock conservation area(Woodstock)  Cute little buggers."
252993,gozwob,2008-09-26 23:09:00,34,nice work folks......beauty smallies!!
252996,mepps,2008-09-26 23:53:00,1301,NICE!! Those are some serious footballs!
252578,jediangler,2008-09-25 11:54:00,1923,"Great report and pics you two. Too bad about your luck on the Grand but she can be a fickle mistress when she wants to be. That is a really nice smallie as well Rich, well done. I'd say that fuzzy critter is a mink. I'm no expert but I think Martens have a white patch under their chin and are a bit larger in size."
252591,joonmoon,2008-09-25 13:02:00,528,"Good job guys, the critter that we all are guessing at in my opinion is a fisher. They are small weasel like scavengers known to frequent shorelines for meals. Martens are more northerly and weasels are more southerly, Mink are much the same but my money is on fisher. Seen lots around the Grand areas I fish. Beauty fish and Sugarpacket you should try out for the Fishergirl calendar....One thing Rich....how the hell did you end up with such a hottie girlfriend?...lol. Glad to see yas had a good few days on the water."
252602,Reef Runner,2008-09-25 13:44:00,980,"That's the way to spend some time off, WTG on the mixed bag!  I think that's a fisher as well, I see them crawling around the rocks when I head to the banks on Lake O sometime.  I like to call them rock rats, lol."
252618,Ramble,2008-09-25 14:10:00,713,"I'm gonna guess mink. Martens live in mature conifer forests for the most part, mink have the white chin, but the picture doesn't show that. Fisher prefer conifer or mixed forests as well. I've seen them around belleville sine there population boom a few years back. That doesn't mean it isn't a fisher, but i'd be surprised to see one living in those rocks they are tree hunters.  In conclusion, i'm betting mink. Did you see a white chin Rich?  -R-"
252622,Leecher,2008-09-25 14:23:00,7832,Great report and pics Rich  Looks like you guys had a blast out there! That bass is a real nice chunky one  Good job you two and thanks for sharing Leechman
252633,corvette1,2008-09-25 15:46:00,1765,what a mixed bag looks like you & sugar had a great time nice smallie
252650,CLofchik,2008-09-25 17:03:00,854," Y'know looking at it again I'm going to have to go with fisher, martens have bigger ears like a cats and their tails are bushier.  There's a small colony of goby addicted martens that run around Bronte after dark, watching them wrestle with lampreys can be a fun way to pass the time"
252652,Bly,2008-09-25 17:33:00,1556,Thanks for sharing your days off with us!  Beauty smallies!
