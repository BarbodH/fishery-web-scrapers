252439,TJQ,2008-09-24 20:18:00,7806,"Got back from Camp Jiggy Jiggy to find my 'net connection out...  got it fixed today and WOW... very nice and fast for now anyway.  Last weekend Monique and I headed up for the opening weekend of partridge hunting, one of our most favorite weekends of the year.. we put a ton of km's on the bike and were pretty successful, bagging 9 birds in an afternoon and a half!  It was a blast, and for once the weather gods were very friendly.  It went down to below zero both nites, but we were warm with a fire.  Here's some pics and comments:  At Dads Outdoor Store in Temagami, we stopped in to see if they had any decent orange raingear, which they did.  Some really nice Helly Hanson gear at a VERY good price, (I have to wait till spring to get my Xtra Lard ass set,...) and we got to looking at this really nice youth model, double barrel .410....  well...  ealry xmas present I guess for Monique.  She fell in love with it!!  http://www.dadstemagami.ca  He had some really nice guns and some excellent prices by the way!  If your going up that way for moose stop in its an excellent store!  After Camp was set up, while i was getting ready to go, Monique walked up the trail and bagged this one not 100 yards from camp.. all by her lonesome!!!   I was grinning ear to ear when I heard the shot!!    What a day we had after that!!       Up to Sisseney lake and a leg stretch!    The one day was windless, what a nice quiet afternoon!    After all the partidge hunting was done, Monique decide on some topwater off the dock using our freinds at Hammerhead topwater lures, and after a bit of persistance she landed this beauty!!!      Of Course... I couldnt let that stand, and after only once cast I put her to shame with this massve Northern....    OK... OK.... maybe I held it a bit too close to the camera.... but hey the smaller ones are harder to catch... takes way more fishing finesse!!    Anyway we had a great weekend with no equipment breakdowns which was nice.  Heres till next time...  and the big hunt is coming SOON!!!"
