252775,danbo,2008-09-26 00:56:00,2646,OFC..Love it or leave it!!
252776,Roy,2008-09-26 01:01:00,13728,I added (NF) to the thread subject line so's people will know not to read this if they only want fishing threads. Hope you don't mind.
252777,Greencoachdog,2008-09-26 01:02:00,8163,  WHY did you have to post another one???  If you're not part of the solution... you're part of the problem!!!
252779,maybe,2008-09-26 01:20:00,307,"Not to be a nitpicker, Kemper...but I think you also forgot vertical holds and muddy/bloody fish.  Roy, you devil, you!"
252780,jwl,2008-09-26 01:21:00,1056," I like that one  perhaps the real question was ""how come no one has been coming on here and giving me a map of all thier good fishin holes, and who wants to lend me the gear so I can try ..oh wait better yet, who wants to just do the fishin for me??? """
252821,Nanook,2008-09-26 03:15:00,565," Shoot, Ive made over 1000 post and the VAST majority nave been N/F. Am I in the wrong place?"
252842,pikehunter,2008-09-26 11:04:00,1659,"OH NO! Not this again.  OH NO! Not this again.  OH NO! Not this again.  OH NO! Not this again.  OH NO! Not this again.  OH NO! Not this again.  OH NO! Not this again.  OH NO! Not this again.  OH NO! Not this again.  Don't like it, well...you know."
252856,Headhunter,2008-09-26 12:40:00,5703,"Terry's turning soft! Quick, everyone Terry's turning soft! See what Ottawa river musky will do to you Terry! Stick to those ""pretty"" silver line screamers! LOL HH"
252678,fishermccann,2008-09-25 19:16:00,655,"Why o why all the none fishing topics, look on the list its about 50% - way too much don't ya say!"
252679,bassjnkie,2008-09-25 19:20:00,1101,"I agree. But all forums are the same. May be we should make a new category called Off Topic, but it's not up to me."
252680,anders,2008-09-25 19:21:00,1168,main page i only counted about 4 or 5.  I dont mind reading some non fishing.  Sometimes i see things (like some news) that i wouldnt have unless i choose to read it.  Always have the option of NOT reading the NF posts.
252681,Terry,2008-09-25 19:22:00,14456,on my first page there are only 4 non fishing threads one of which is yours  but here at OFC we like to chat even when we are not fishing we share our lives and things happening around us and I do understand that that is not what some people want in a fishing forum  there are many other forums out there that might suit you better but it would be nice if you hung around
252682,fish_finder,2008-09-25 19:28:00,370,"I like to see it as a place to chat with like minded folk......whether its about fishing or not, its usually good chatter."
252683,addy79,2008-09-25 19:30:00,573,"cry me a river...  topic doesnt interest you, dont read it!   problem solved!!"
252684,ecmilley,2008-09-25 19:39:00,2163,"this again, oh well console is better"
252687,John,2008-09-25 19:49:00,2956, Well said Terry...
252690,Joey,2008-09-25 19:57:00,9122,"Oh brother, not this question again  Don't read them!!!  Simple."
252694,TennesseeGuy,2008-09-25 20:30:00,957,I appreciate a good title that is not misleading about the post content.  I'm aware that most posters are not trying to please only me.
252695,highdrifter,2008-09-25 20:31:00,2534,"Not enough people fishing with too much time on their hands..  We're all to blame for that one!  We could post more, but....  Someone fill the gap for me.  HD"
252698,kemper,2008-09-25 20:45:00,2232,"Beer, Wings, DANG!  again?  Console, mallows, flossing."
252707,steve_paul,2008-09-25 20:54:00,658,Time for a poll soon I think
252709,pigeonfisher,2008-09-25 21:04:00,696," Kemper,  You forgot Elitism   DANG, BEER, WINGS, ELITISM"
252710,kentooley,2008-09-25 21:06:00,208,Tiller!
252712,johnnyb,2008-09-25 21:14:00,3413,"First: what Terry said Second: If there's not a lot of topics that interest you, putter through the rest of the site...classifieds section, news/announcements...or...and this one may be a stretch...make a post about fishing!"
252714,blaque,2008-09-25 21:16:00,2419," Yu furrgot 2 right ""NF"" inn yur thred tidal"
252719,bukee,2008-09-25 21:27:00,58,Yuk.......grrrrrrrrrrrrr........who started this non fishing topic....lol.
252720,aplumma,2008-09-25 21:32:00,6896,Does this mean you don't want to know whats going on in other peoples lives? I like to read that Bernie has finished the roof on the cottage and that Nanook is on the mend or even that bill's wife had a baby. If I didn't want to read those then I would see that they have placed the universal signal of NF ( not fishing) beside it so I would just breeze by the post and read the other 50% of the threads which is still a lot of reading enjoyment for all of the money that you have spent getting here.   Art
252721,kemper,2008-09-25 21:34:00,2232,"  I knew I was forgetting something!  elitist Basssturds.  or steelheaders?  oh wait,  thats me."
252723,Wild,2008-09-25 21:39:00,704,From now on all yer posts must contain at least one fish pic!
252764,Ron,2008-09-26 00:23:00,1683,  Holy Crap Terry!  You must be having a good day! ha ha ha
252768,salmon,2008-09-26 00:34:00,334,The NF topics keep me from going insane? LOL
252770,Terry,2008-09-26 00:37:00,14456,hey it's the new kinder gentler  me......LOL
252774,holdfast,2008-09-26 00:53:00,1813,agreed
