1030640,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-03 18:10:00,937,I know its early but I just bought my first flip over ice hut and runners. I was wondering if I should build a smitty or will the runners be enough?    
1030644,Terry,2018-07-03 18:24:00,14456,Are you pullin by hand yes build a smitty skidoo or  ATVs.  Not as much.
1030650,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-03 18:42:00,937,"Yup, pulling by hand. Are the runners only good for when there are no snow on the ice?"
1030655,Terry,2018-07-03 18:54:00,14456,IMO  the runners are more to protect the tub with a smitty the hut is twice as easy to pull by hand
1030656,AKRISONER,2018-07-03 18:58:00,5558,"if towing it by hand, you will definitely want to get it up outta the snow. Ive got a 2 man clam and its basically impossible to tow through the snow by yourself for more than a couple of hundred meters."
1030657,porkpie,2018-07-03 19:18:00,2521,"For that 2 man, your going to want the smitty sled.  I sometimes even put my one man on the sled if the snow is deep and the ice still a bit skinny for a machine.  Build it!!"
1030658,ketchenany,2018-07-03 19:38:00,3229,we have pro smitty builder on the board  a bit of  a loony too.
1030662,misfish,2018-07-03 20:31:00,29133,LMAO 4 SOME ?
1030663,misfish,2018-07-03 20:41:00,29133,"You will want a smitty. Question is, do you have a truck or car ? Here is mine with the smitty upside down. Fits like a glove. I will be going from 10"" lift to 12"" next year.  Also going with the new style skis. My buddy used them last year. They glide so easy. "
1030698,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-04 18:26:00,937,Thanks guys  Both. What are new style skis?
1030699,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-04 18:29:00,937,My buddy built these for his flip over.  I was thinking building the same.    
1030701,AKRISONER,2018-07-04 19:01:00,5558,i believe he is referring to parabolic vs straight skis...
1030704,ketchenany,2018-07-04 19:20:00,3229,wouldn't water skis work much better because of the extra width?
1030707,misfish,2018-07-04 20:19:00,29133,"NOOOOOOOO  LOL  Yes you would correct. They are wider now and they seem to need less attention, waxing then the old style. Plus the wide fronts will lift on the snow instead of digging ."
1030708,misfish,2018-07-04 20:23:00,29133,"Theres your guy to build for ya. Remember to keep the weight to the back. Im going to try something different. Looking at a horse drawn wagon, you will notice there is to 2 lines to the draw bar. SO im thinking this would work not pulling the tip inwards. From the bar, I will have a pull rope in the middle. Hope that kinda made sense. "
1030709,misfish,2018-07-04 20:28:00,29133,
1030710,ketchenany,2018-07-04 21:41:00,3229,Nice corn dog stand!
1030711,misfish,2018-07-04 22:26:00,29133,?
1030732,BFSC Kevin,2018-07-05 14:45:00,1351,Yes build one. No doubt.
1030733,BFSC Kevin,2018-07-05 14:47:00,1351,Runners don't help with the hand pulling. They are for protecting the tub if you're pulling over concrete on the road or pulling behind a machine on ice. You want a Smitty sled to lift your hut off the snow so it's not plowing it while you're hand pulling. Less friction.
1030734,BFSC Kevin,2018-07-05 14:48:00,1351,"The devil is that, Brian."
1030735,Terry,2018-07-05 15:02:00,14456,  the rope from the skis could be rods 
1030738,misfish,2018-07-05 15:33:00,29133,"Yup ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Like I said, this I believe would stop the tips of the skis from bending in.  Yes you could pull from the smitty it,self, but I like the idea of being able to lift the skies over banks and ledges. Where you been my bearded friend ? "
1030744,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-05 17:51:00,937,"Instead of pulling a smitty by rope, has anyone tried building a push bar at the back like a shopping cart?"
1030767,SirCranksalot,2018-07-06 01:43:00,3291,No comments on the sled but that ice sure looks good in the middle of this stinking heat!!?
