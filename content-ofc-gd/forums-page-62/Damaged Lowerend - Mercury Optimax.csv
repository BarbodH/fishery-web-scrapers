1030205,hutch4113,2018-06-23 19:13:00,374,"Hi Everyone, Looking for some assistance.  At the end of the season, I hit a rock and damaged the Skeg.  No biggie I thought, as I have access to someone who works with Aluminum.  Finally able to pull the boat out this weekend, to get it addressed, and ready for the season.  However after we took the Lower End off (which came off fine) we noticed that I had actually cracked the Aluminum further up as well - by the shifter. Any thoughts on what I should do to get it fix?  And where I should take it? (Barrie, Ontario).  I am not sure it will be a quick fix.  I am checking with my Aluminum guy as well and will see. I was turning when I hit, so I am guessing that is why I have damage further up.  Mechanically the motor works fine - I used it the rest of the weekend without issue.  (By the way - what do I call that part of the motor?).

1030209,hutch4113,2018-06-23 20:20:00,374," It was.  I thought I had taken out the Hull.  My family heard it from the Island we were staying out, and came out to investigate."
1030211,aplumma,2018-06-23 21:00:00,6896,The name of it is the lower end or lower unit you can purchase reconditioned lower ends from various places. The ability to weld it needs to be looked at closely by a welder.  Sorry as garnet pointed out I was wrong I thought it was on the lower unit from the picture. Art
1030215,Garnet,2018-06-23 21:24:00,2056,The lower unit is off that part is called the leg.. If it can't be welded  it's a total disassembly of the motor to replace that part. And it's big money. I would take it to Top Gun or Extreme for consult it could be a write off.
1030217,John Bacon,2018-06-23 23:00:00,3277,"Is it insured?  If so, hopefully it is not too late to contact them.  It looks like it would be worth going through insurance if it is covered. "
1030222,DRIFTER_016,2018-06-23 23:22:00,10439,Citywide Welding in Mississauga does lower units as well as props. They should be able to fix that up for you.
1030229,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-24 01:30:00,8243,"With a whack like that it may be more than a crack. The drive shaft may be bent. Post this ? on iboats.com. If there is an answer 1 of the 10,000 marine gurus will have it."
1030247,Sinker,2018-06-24 14:03:00,8692,"Yeah, I'd say there is more damage there that you aren't seeing. That's a hard smack to do that. Take a real long, hard, close look at your transom too. Oh, and blow the dust off your wallet, your going to need it.  S."
