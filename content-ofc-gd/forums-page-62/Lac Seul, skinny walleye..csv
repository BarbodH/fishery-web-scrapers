Wanted to show him the lac Seul walleye experience...hmmmmmmm....took 4 hours to land the first fish....that has never happened before. heard reports from all over of the same experience last week. Some of the fish we caught when they eventually decided to bite were very skinny, also heard reports of this from all areas of the lake, hope its just the hot weather/low water.  "

No fish in the morning, then hit a hot spot and land 13 in an hour or two, then not even a bite the next day in the same spot. I can't figure it out. Hopefully its just a phase for now.  Glad you got into a few of them."
