1030566,Joeytier,2018-07-02 16:33:00,3990," One of the more memorable mornings of fishing I've ever had.  Enforced my love for these fish, and the places they live.  I was out the door before 4:00 to get back to these fish early, everything caught before 7:30.  As soon as I felt the warmth of the sun on my back, things had shut down.  This was my last trip pre-heatwave.  The lakes will be too warm to safely catch these fish without killing every single one.  Praying for cool and rain."

1030578,Tomcat,2018-07-02 20:05:00,395,Fabulous wild brook trout action. Just outstanding to be able to hear the drag singing. Thanks for sharing.
1030581,Moosebunk,2018-07-02 21:41:00,3970,Very nice Joey. The kind of morning that you'll never forget for sure.
1030588,Acountdeleted,2018-07-02 22:55:00,2562,Holy smokes. Some great fish bud.
1030590,Joeytier,2018-07-02 23:42:00,3990,"Thanks Jeremy, hope all's with you man. That is for shore.  It was part lake selection, part timing, part luck lol There's not much out there in fresh water that pulls harder than a large brookie pound-for-pound.  With light line and small baits/hooks, you really can't horse them in either.  These were all landed on 4 lb test."
