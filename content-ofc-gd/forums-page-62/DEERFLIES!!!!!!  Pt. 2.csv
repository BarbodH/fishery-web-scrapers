One part water, one part ACV. Spray all over and saturate tips of ears and base of tail(they go for highest point). You have to reapply every 15 min. or so, but it's better than a kick in the bum(with a frozen boot). At least she can run and play for stretches without the vile things on her. P.S. It has to be raw, unpasteurized and contain ""mother of vinegar"". Try it, T."
