Marty, we live up by Gettysburg and it's been a great area to raise the kids and enjoy what life brings us.  I get to Pittsburgh a couple times a year, but the trips are always short. Gerritt, FF #2 NNA&S does this make that old group like the ""Original Gangsters""? douG, How many days of Pho did we share.  Not enough.  Too Many good times were had.  I hope that same community feel still exists.  Anyhoo...I will post a report if and when said trip takes place.  Otherwise it'll be a pan fry or something for the kids.  Be Cool.  Steve"
