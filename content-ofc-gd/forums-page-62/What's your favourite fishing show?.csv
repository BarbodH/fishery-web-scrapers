Going fishing TV? seriously? That show is such crap. He fishes in remote locations where anyone could catch anything and then he eats everything! You have to love the heavy breathing and lip smacking/grunting as he stuggles to bring in a 2lb walleye."
175681,doubleheader,2008-03-24 19:38:00,497,"With my Dish Network I record at least 20 fishing shows.  Hands down the best of the best is Larry Dahlberg's The Hunt For Big Fish.  http://www.huntforbigfish.com/upcoming.html  He''s the real deal. He can handle a fly rod as easily as a big caster. He goes to places no one else even considers. He's obsessed yet has a nice way about him on camera. He's not an informercial, in fact he shares how he makes many of his own swin baits."
175752,Billy Bob,2008-03-24 22:22:00,5865,"I agree with you that Larry Dahlberg's The Hunt For Big Fish is  GOOD show but it's not about fishing in areas we would be fishing. Going overseas or to wild area's in Africa or South America is not something I will ever be doing so I really don't learn much from watching his show. However, Larry is a GREAT guy to watch and easy to like. If I remember correctly he was a chief editor with In-Fisherman years ago when the Linder brothers own the company. His show is definitely a different show and a breath of fresh air when everyone else is doing the same old, same old thing."

Bob's knows his stuff but seems bored.  Urban outdoor adventure?               : Great variety. Informative and down to earth.   Conclusion: U.O.A takes the prize.  Going fishing blows donkey chunks. I like a show with variety and doesen' just show bass and walleye caught from a boat over and over again. There are many species out there that seems to be overlooked. I think these shows need to have more nerve and imagination and feature them  No more ""same old, same old' please  Thanks for reading hot air (lol)"

Mercer's show is cool. I like the format except he doesn't tell you where he fishes sometimes. Scott Martin is a cool concept too.  Shows I don't like, well Cronzy is a tool. Aside from the fact that his campfire is completely ridiculous, anybody can go to a lodge and have guides put them on fish. I also don't like that Fishing University show. That guy a billboard and doesn't stop plugging products. Another show I can't stand is Lunkerville. The guy looks like a bum and looks so awkward when he is fishing."

But I can respect that part of his show.  He does it knowing many viewers, like me, don't like it, but puts it on anyways.  Other shows, like FNC Uncut, put things on to gamble that viewers will like it (IMO).  So even though I dislike both Al's spiritual bit and FNC Uncut, I respect the former for being himself but not the latter for trying to artificially differentiate their product."

When I finally was able to get WFN I was exited to see Al again, that is until the end of the show when he started quoting passages from the Bible. Not the time or place for Bible study in my opinion.  Every other show is a half hour infomercial. When Angelo Viola brings the CEO of Cooper Tire on and they start talking about which tire is best for his Dodge Ram to trailer his Pricecraft boat with the Mercury Optimax which he uses his Shimano rod and reels with a Rappala on to fish while at ABC Lodge of which his Garmin GPS helped him and Pete find it then they put on the Muskol, that was enough.  I cancelled my WFN subscription and saved me a total of $1.99 plus HST. No more infomercials. If I want to know something about fishing I'll come here and ask.  I will watch Charlie Wray on Saturdays. He is no only a good guy personally he actually talks about how he caught that fish. Of course with all the stuff that sponsors his show. No sponsor no show unfortunately. I have learned much about long lining from him, of course as long as I have Seagaur leader tied on.  I'll say it again no sponsor, no show."

There's three reasons why I watch it. #1 is because it's on the Oasis channel in high def. Just awesome video quality. #2 is because he's an entertaining host. He gets right into his quarry, and doesn't try to educate the viewers about the basics. In fact he doesn't attempt to educate at all, which is probably my biggest pet peeve about most shows. He just goes fishing and takes you along with him. #3 is the fact that he fishes many of the same species that I do. His Labrador Brook Trout show was simply awesome. I've seen it 3 or 4 times now and I'll watch it again if I get the chance. He generally fishes the northern areas of Canada. Lake Trout, Grayling, Pike, Brookies, Steelhead and Salmon. YEAH!!!

Anything with Lindner is a must watch, every show he films is packed with very useful information.  Newer shows that I enjoy are the Musky Hunter, Urban Outdoor Adventures, The New Fly Fisher and Fishing Alberta. I watch Fishing Alberta regularly now that my brother moved to Edmonton, so when I go visit him this year I'll be ready with locations and techniques.  Honourable mention goes to Extreme Angler TV.  A very informative show, but do they only fish for bass? Mind you I haven't watched very many episodes, but I don't recall watching one with a different target species. Is this bad luck on my part, or is it the norm?  Finally, another honourable mention goes to Good Fishing with Babe Winkleman. I find this show both informative and entertaining.

I like the shows that feature Lake Ontario, Lake Simcoe,Erie,St, Clair, Georgian Bay and Inland lakes from up north. Stuff most of us can fish and can drive too. Kinda why I like making vids of local up to date fishing."

175437,waterwolf,2008-03-24 02:16:00,556,"quality viewing always from the LINDERS . no loud , irritating music  , just no-nonsense info i can use or enjoy watching.     izumi's got a decent take on things with a bit of humor thrown in for entertainment.  i'll watch almost anything fishing related except  leo stacos  , ron james ,ok, not that side kick."
175469,holdfast,2008-03-24 03:43:00,1813," Only one problem with Charlie Wray, he is a walking ,talking advertisement for Seagar, St Croix, and OKuma.  As a matter of fact, he is so bad, its aggravating"

Courtney and Shelleys i think was supposed to be a Girl's-Gone-Wild-Fishing-in-their-Bikinis show but then the producers changed their minds when they saw them in their swimsuits.  Its like watching an episode of The Real Life (except theyre not hot, plus they don't know how to fish and have no clue wth they're talking about)"

I gotta say, my fav would be The Musky Hunter, informative, to the point and no Bull...  Plus, the hosts don't talk to you like you just finished grade school (Watch Bob Mehsikomer or Italo, you'll know what I'm talking about)"
175593,Billy Bob,2008-03-24 16:36:00,5865,"Does anyone remember a GREAT looking gal named Debbie Johannesson. I believe her show was called ""Outdoor Encounters"".  I have a autographed picture from 1992 and back then she was a HOT Blonde that loved to fish.  Met her at the Buffalo Show that year. I just got there about 30 minutes earlier. When I stopped for her picture she autographed it for me and ask if I wanted to go for breakfast with her. Being married I thanks but I just got there and wanted to see the rest of the show."

Once a poacher, always a poacher. Wazchuch can keep his golf and salty fish, I don't watch him anyway."
95933,Handlebarz,2007-07-19 21:13:00,3790,My Favorite show is urban Outdoors Adventures it has been a great show to watch these last couple years cant wait for the next season.

In the ""All Canadian Fishing"" section go down to Shawn Rickard's Urban Outdoor Adventures and check out the Kawartha episode.

174254,Zubris21,2008-03-20 20:38:00,563,"I just thought of one more show that I liked but it totally contradicts this , but I can't remember the name of it. The host looks like Conan O'Brien and he has some great destinations although a little far for me, but the photography was incredible. I love the Yukon pike episode. Somebody post the name of this show for me. Where did it go?    I think your referring to Hooked up with Mark Kruppa.  I liked that show too but it seems to have been taken off the air.  The guy is kinda flaky sometimes but he does get to some great locations.   I was actually watching a movie (human trafficking) and he has a pretty lead role in it.  I looked up his bio and the guy has been fishing forever (as with most of them) but he is also a professional photographer, can speak 4 languages and has been in quite a few movies.  I also agree about your view on Pete Bowman and The guys from FishTV, I think they make great hosts.  I have to say the worst of them out there has got to be Italo,  seems like every other episode is on Bay of Quinte (not that its bad fishing, just gets boring seeing the same thing all the time).  He treats all his guests like imbeciles and he seems almost scared of the fish at times."
174281,Billy Bob,2008-03-20 22:26:00,5865,"#1 Linder's Angler's Edge  Since I don't get the Outdoor Channel (next higher tier of programming) I haven't seen IN-Fishermen in a LONG time. However, I can't see it being the same since the Linder's sold IN-Fishermen.  That was I thought the ELITE fishing info show. Now most of what we see are just commercials telling us what rod. reel, line and lure to use. The other day they even gave a plug to the landing net they were using.  Even the Linders are guilty of this.  #2 Babe Winkleman is OK. He was better years ago when he was married to Charlie. Who trades DOWN when you get remarried.  This wife is down right UGLY.  I use to see Babe years ago at the Cleveland Sportsmen Show. He stayed at the same hotel as we did and he was a PLAYER when it came to the ladies of the night. He always had a girl or TWO at the bar with him.  Red Fisher was entertaining. My wife always got a kick out of him when he would hide in the bushes after his shore lunch to film the sea gulls coming in to clean up the left overs. If you remember he would always have binoculars hanging around his neck. They were filled with booze. Red Fisher was a drunk.  I really miss the old IN-Fishermen ONE HOUR shows. When they first came on there were only 4-6 shows a year because there was so much content in that one hour show. Now they could do almost a whole season what they did for those one hour shows. Just too much selling now a days. I still have MANY tapes of those show. Don't know how they are holding up in VHS tapes but I must have about 20 tapes of IN-Fishermen."

95457,nautifish,2007-07-18 17:12:00,1416,To be honest i would rather just be out fishing. I am not a tv buff as it is.  I am partial to dave mercer mostly because i just love his sence of humour on or by the water. Courtney & shelley how the heck did they even manage to get a show? Talk about put you to sleep. That has to be one of the worst. & these shows where they are fishing in burmuda and the carribian and staying at resorts where i would have to second mortage my house. C'mon now. Those shows do not interest me one iota.   Honestly though i like to watch all the real life fishing video's on You tube myself.

He may stretch the truth a little now and again, but isn't that part of fishing history as well. You know the old adage ""a fish story"" .... well, that may have well started with Chronzy LOL.As far as his shore lunches go I wouldn't mind joining him for a few. I like his articles in the ""Ontario Fisherman"" mag as well.I sure would love to own his property. WOW!  I guess if I could only watch one it'd probably be The Next Bite. I like watcing them catch the toothy critters and Pete Maina seems like he'd be fun to fish with. Talk about a walking commercial though. Just had my first Johnsonville Brats on the bbq at Murphy's Point last week. Not bad actually. Also,Fish n Canada seems to get a bad wrap as well around here and of all the hosts I'd want to fish with Pete Bowman get's the nod as my favorite. I'm not even sure why. I just like the guy. He's very entertaining and down to earth. Seems like good people to me.Fish TV's Ron James (seems like great people too) and Leo Stakos seem to get little airplay, but have a really great balance between teaching and entertainment. I'd like the show even more if I could actually see it more. Get on board with these guys WFN!  Shaun Rickards Urban Outdoor Adventures is also one of my favorites because it's educational, shows local areas ( that I have a chance of fishing someday) and has alot less hype and advertising throughout the show. Extereme Angler is also very cool, but in a completely different way. There's headbanging adrenaline   and some serious bass action. Pretty hard to fall asleep during this show LOL. I wish there was a little less hype and a little more teaching, but if I'm in the mood this show can be enjoyable (especially having a couple drinks with a fishing buddy). Sorry BigBassRich, I'm not trashing your favorite show and maybe Karl could take a couple pointers from the Action Angling Crew. There are so many shows I enjoy, but most of the shows I like to learn from as well. I'm well behind most of you on this board in the experience and knowledge departments, so I try to take in (and make sense of) as much info as I can. So I look for entertainment but most importantly information. I just thought of one more show that I liked but it totally contradicts this , but I can't remember the name of it. The host looks like Conan O'Brien and he has some great destinations although a little far for me, but the photography was incredible. I love the Yukon pike episode. Somebody post the name of this show for me. Where did it go? Since this has been ""dug up"" im March of 2008 I'll have to add Simply fishing with Charlie Wray (one of my favorites now), the ""New Fly Fisher"" show and Dave Mercers new ""Facts Of Fishing"" show since it didn't exist before. Also the 2008 Extreme Angler shows seem better than ever with more teaching/adviice happening. If I could just shut up that tickertape thing at the bottom of the screen LOL."

95643,solopaddler,2007-07-19 01:29:00,8605," Actually I agree too. Funny story about Cronzy: I was paddling by myself through a small lake on the Attwood River system N/E of Armstrong when I spied a vacant outpost camp. Whenever I do any of these long solo trips I always check the camps for food left behind by fishermen, sometimes it's a goldmine. Anyhow, I walk in and I'm assaulted by this horrible stench. On the table is a bowl filled with rotting pieces of fried chicken, yech! Although I was so hungry that I ""almost"" tried a piece anyway  . Beyond that there was tons of other non perishable food: pasta and jars of sauce, 2 packs of Kraft Dinner, cans of beans and chili, box of complete pancake mix and syrop, a box of chocolate/marshmallow cookies, 2 cans of peaches, instant coffee, sugar and whitener, several cans of Coke, and BEST of all an almost full 40oz bottle of Crown Royal  . On the wall written in magic marker with the date being the DAY before: ""Gone Fishin' film crew, Darryl and Josh Choronzey"" THANK'S CRONZ! I lived off your scraps for a full week   (although I drank a large portion of the Crown Royal at the end of a particularly brutal day and it just about killed me  )"

I do enjoy Getting Hooked, Urban Outdoor Adventures, and Fishful Thinking - good clear, watchable hosts who fish ""regular"" spots & teach you a few things.  Ive been watching & reading Choronzey (Going Fishing/Ontario Fisherman) since nearly the beginning. Ive said it once & i'll say it again... Darryl is the Don Cherry of Ontario fishing, you may not agree with him, but he says it how it is & isnt affraid of the the outcome & most often is factually correct. And being a Great Lakes (Salmon) guy myself, I almost allways totally agree with his view point."

All about fun, never anything serious, just wacky on the water antics and he caught a ton of fish!  He actually changed his name from Claude to Fish legally! (from what I remember)  One episode he wanted to do was on getting hooked and how to remove a hook from yourself.  He got tired of waiting for it to happen so he picked up a treble hook and jammed it in his hand!  I wish I could get hold of the tapes.  Now he just sits around in a studio hosting Bass Masters or something... he not like he was in his shows."

He mostly fished for bass from the area and always put on a good show. I remember one show he did for bass & musky with Big Jim.  No crapola, but a good sense of humour and some interesting stuff.....anybody remember who I'm talkin about ??  There was another 1/2 decent show I used to like with a girl by the name of Karen Monahan ......or sumthin like that.....but I think she got involved in  the scandal with Henry & Italo and sorta disappeared from the fish'n scene."

95903,Handlebarz,2007-07-19 20:01:00,3790,"here is a story that was printed about Italo and Henery  April 3, 1998   Two Men Fined A Total Of $1,800 For Fishing Violations Italo Labignan, 41, of Freelton, Ontario and Henry Waszczuk, 47, of Burlington, Ontario were fined a total of $1,800 today on three charges under the Ontario Fishery Regulations.  Labignan and Waszczuk pleaded guilty to a joint charge of using a hook in a manner to hook whitefish in body parts other than in the mouth. They appeared in Ontario Court (Provincial Division) in Trenton. Labignan also pleaded guilty to a charge under the regulations of failing to release a fish in a manner that caused the least harm to the fish and was fined $200. Labignan and Waszczuk are the hosts of a television show, Canadian Sportfishing.  Conservation Officers from the Ministry of Natural Resources investigated the two men's fishing activities after receiving a complaint. During the investigation, COs seized a number of video tapes. The tapes, along with other evidence, showed the two men as they were videotaped fishing for whitefish in the Trent River in Trenton on November 6, 1995 using a fishing lure commonly called a jig. They caught a number of whitefish, and with the possible exception of one or two fish, the fish were hooked in parts of the body other than in the mouth. The whitefish were re-hooked in the mouth and then the fish were taped being brought in once again.  As part of the sentence, the court ordered them to destroy all video footage for November 6, 1995 that may be in their possession or control. Video footage already seized by the MNR was ordered forfeited.  Labignan's charge of failing to release a lake trout caught during a closed season resulted from an incident on the Trent River in Trenton on November 6, 1995. Labignan obtained a lake trout caught by another angler, hooked it onto his own fishing line, and recorded the fish being brought in.  In addition, Karen Monaghan, 37, host of a TV show produced by Canadian Sportfishing called the Natural Angler of Toronto, was fined $800 after she pleaded guilty to a charge under the Ontario Fishery Regulations of using a hook in a manner to hook whitefish in body parts other than in the mouth.  The court was told this offence also took place at the Trent River in Trenton on November 6, 1995, Monaghan hooked a number of whitefish in body parts other than the mouth using fishing jigs. The fish were then re-hooked in the mouth and recorded being brought in, hooked in the mouth. Monaghan was ordered to destroy all video footage for November 6, 1995 in her possession or control, and a forfeiture order was issued for the video footage already seized by MNR.

95250,John,2007-07-18 01:31:00,2956,To be honest I don't watch them. Just most of them way too corny for my taste........

95281,Gerritt,2007-07-18 02:28:00,6129,"I voted other because all of the above suck...  Fish'n Canada Lost me when they went ""EXTREME"" it was Bull Izumi fishes places I could never afford.. I just DONT like Canadian Sportfishing... Fishing the Flats... well yeah not in my lifetime The New fly fisherman.... well I aint one. Going fishing TV.... nope not a chance...  You forgot the much loathed fishing with Shelly and Courtney though...not to mention a SLEW of others...  I also like Angler Edge and Urban Outdoor adventures.. They keep fishing real for the average joe  I think this poll should be for the most hated fishing show on tv... as not one is better then the other..  PS.. add the dimebags to that list and you have a perfect most hated list! LOL  Gerritt."
95289,Stoty,2007-07-18 02:48:00,2910,My Fav's:  - Scott Martin Challenge - Beat Charlie Moore - Best of FLW Tour - Bass Techs  GOD BLESS THE WFN!!!!!!!
95291,Guest lundboy,2007-07-18 02:52:00,0," Other for me.... Big Al's the MAN!!    In-Fisherman is nothing since he left.  His new AnglingEdge is the Best!  I've been watching it for over a year on U.S. TV (old U.S. OLN now called Versus,  I won't say how).  I almost have the entire 07 season recorded to DVD, just have to pvr the 8th episode on the 23rd and that will be it.  It's what fishing shows should be.  It tells you exactly what to use, where to use it and why to use it.  Still some commercialism though.   I do watch the occasional Bill Dance for the entertainment value."
95293,Raf,2007-07-18 02:53:00,3495,"couldnt tell ya, i am out fishn when they are on."
95294,FishFinder,2007-07-18 02:53:00,481,what no Getting Hooked with Aaron and Barry?
95295,StrikePro,2007-07-18 02:53:00,29,WFN is incredible!  I don't see how anyone can stand Chronzy though.  He patronizes the hell out of all his guests and fishes in areas that you have to have next to no skill to catch fish.
95299,Bcee,2007-07-18 02:54:00,25,"Mine is ""Get Wild with Cindy Garrison"", for obviosu reasons...  http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/tv/news..._Wild_Saltwater  "

95305,Guest lundboy,2007-07-18 03:00:00,0,"  Courtney and Shelley, CDN Sportfishing get my vote for worst ever (GAG), but that WFN show that has the 40 carp tournament guys sitting around the pond for an hour is pretty bad as well"
95307,Guest lundboy,2007-07-18 03:04:00,0,"  Oh Oh... watch out Al Lindner, I may have to change my pick....."
95330,danbo,2007-07-18 07:35:00,2646,Angler's Edge
95332,xrap,2007-07-18 08:06:00,683,"Extreme Angler for me, And Canadian Sport fishing is alright if thier not fishing in cuba or something. Those episodes suck."
95335,lew,2007-07-18 08:48:00,12766,"About the only one I ever watch anymore is Izumi, always enjoyed his show since he 1st came on the tube 20 odd years ago and still find him entertaining.  All Cronzy wants to do is eat every fish in the lake.....  Italo always makes me think he's talkin to a bunch of 6 year olds, and why does he measure every  fish he catches ?? Who else measures every fish they catch....and why would you  ??.....and why is he always impressed by the way a fish shines  ....sheeeeeeesh.....  That guy from Simply Fishing is nuthin but a walking commercial.....  And Fish'n Canada.......well, we won't even go there.....  Always liked In-Fisherman, but can't get it anymore.  I'm with Raf, better to go catch yer own fish than watch these guys"
95349,Rich,2007-07-18 11:07:00,3927,Extreme Angler TV is my favourite by far.
95362,wallyboss,2007-07-18 12:07:00,1095,"I would have to say that i have a bunch of favs. 1) The Next Bite 2) Extreme Angler 3) Angler Edge 4) Urban Outdoor Adventure 5) Real Fishing 297,000,000)    Anything with Italo or Henry. Once a poacher, always a Poacher 297,000,001)  C R O N Z Y The big fat musky fillet eater.  Big Fat (talking about the fillet)"
95370,aniceguy,2007-07-18 12:29:00,1094,"FLW, and fishing university"
95373,tonyb,2007-07-18 12:51:00,1637," That's what I was gonna say!  Best show for spots around here, although I think they are filming a Shark episode out in Nova Scotia soon.  That's great and all, but I think the format of fishing local urban spots or drive-to lakes and providing tips to catch more of those pressured fish we all encounter is the key to success in this market.  Anyone can catch fish at a fly-in lodge or some crazy secluded floating lodge out in BC or Cuba, keep it real!  Also, I like the In-fisherman stuff (technical approach to fishing and understanding fish behaviour), FLW Outdoors (High tech cameras and overall great tourny coverage), Pro Tarpon tour (insane crowds of boats going bonkers, fish jumping into boats,...mayhem   ) and there are probably some others I am forgetting since I haven't had T.V. for about 6 months."
95374,tonyb,2007-07-18 12:56:00,1637," I wonder if you know the real story behind what happened to Canadian Sportfishing...  Cronzey...Well he does overdo the shore lunch thing, but you'd be hard pressed to find another fishing show host with as much knowledge on conservation, stocking, mnr politics as he does.  Credit where credit is due..."
95375,BITEME,2007-07-18 12:57:00,1968,  I'll second that!!!!!!!!!
95379,wallyboss,2007-07-18 13:21:00,1095,"A poll is usually to voice your opinion!!!! I voiced mine. I really don't care if they had a reason to poach!!!!!!They still poached and they were fined for it.  And the other concern about Cronzy I don't know him personally and all I have to go with is his fishing show(which this poll was all about) and he is still my 297,00,001 choice."
