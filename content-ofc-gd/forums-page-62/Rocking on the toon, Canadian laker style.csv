1030562,misfish,2018-07-02 15:58:00,29133,"Thanks fellas  Got off just before the dark clouds started to move in this morning. Played 2 innings. 6 strike outs. One has bling bling, as I seemed to have a knot in my leader. Lost 6ft of leader and a vabrado.  Short work week then fly fishing for largies on the weekend."
1030564,misfish,2018-07-02 16:12:00,29133,Your  coming to  Angus ? LOL That will be a day for sure Doug.
1030567,akaShag,2018-07-02 16:56:00,2073,"Yep.  I reckon you, Einrich and I could find a spot to wet our whistle.....?"
1030569,Joeytier,2018-07-02 17:04:00,3990,All ya need is one when they're big like that.
1030585,misfish,2018-07-02 22:16:00,29133,I keep the odd one for an old friend. That fish will feed him many meals.
1030586,misfish,2018-07-02 22:18:00,29133,Maybe he has a BBQ and a cooler Doug.
1030591,Joeytier,2018-07-02 23:43:00,3990,"I didnt mean for eating, but yes that too lol! Straight to the smoker with those big fatties"
1030651,Acountdeleted,2018-07-03 18:44:00,2562,Holy smokes. Some real nice lakers there. Happy Canada day bud. Looks like you had a blast.
1030653,Moosebunk,2018-07-03 18:53:00,3970,"""Take it... to the limit.""  How befitting a tune to be playing in that toon. You've certainly pimped it out since I last saw it. Lots of vigor on the torpedo release. lol. Great lakers! Surprised they didn't burn that Symetre right out."
1030660,misfish,2018-07-03 20:26:00,29133,"No way in hell would I put a laker in my smoker. White fish only. LOL Thanks Drew. This old man is having fun. The way it is suppose to be. Think I lost about 6 pounds this weekend, rowing and sweating. Is that what that reel is?Never looked. LOL With all this hot weather Jer, I will be waiting til the fall again to get up your way. That lake warms up fast. They get that dam issue resolved? Hows the baby factory coming along ?"
1030666,akaShag,2018-07-03 21:19:00,2073,"WHOA!!!  Only whities for the smoker?  Lakers are excellent smoked.  Cut fillets into chunks about two inches wide.  Use a wet brine for 24 hours in the fridge, take the chunks out and allow them to dry on newspaper or paper towels (to form the pellicle) and into the smoker for three pans of hickory.  It's good filtered try again please, mon."
1030667,akaShag,2018-07-03 21:20:00,2073,"""filtered try again please"" what the hell? I said Good Charlie Hotel India Tango................"
1030671,Acountdeleted,2018-07-03 21:53:00,2562,"The dam is still a mess. I have no idea what they are doing. Let me know when you are free late September, early October, my cousin and I do fall fishing up there. Bass are hard to find but walleye and Muskie are usually pretty active.  Looks like I have about a year before we start trying for a baby. Wedding date is May 25 2019."
1030837,Rustic-Fisher,2018-07-08 21:01:00,826,Nice fish Brian !!! Love the toon .
