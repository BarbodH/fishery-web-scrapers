1029987,mamona,2018-06-19 13:05:00,597,"Cannot stop staring at the photos, nice trip! Where did you catch the biggest ones? Shallow, deep? Weeds, some other structures? What was the water temperature?"
1030003,NAW,2018-06-19 16:03:00,4022,Amazing!!
1030018,blaque,2018-06-20 13:55:00,2419,"Awesome fish, had to be a blast"
1030022,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-20 17:07:00,8243,"Talk about The Beauty and the Beasts. You being one of the beasts. Good going,  you 2 slayed them."
1030024,lunkerbasshunter,2018-06-20 17:28:00,2585,WOW those are some amazing fish thanks for posting! Cheers!
1030051,adempsey,2018-06-20 21:53:00,1498,Baboom! Really nice fish Bill and friend!
1030098,crittermo,2018-06-21 14:13:00,2,"You didn't mention the name of the lake, is it a secret spot or can you tell us what lake it is?"
1030120,aplumma,2018-06-21 19:13:00,6896,Good question but one that we ask people not to answer on this board. We prefer people get out and find their own places so they do not become over fished. Thank you Art
1030138,Carp,2018-06-22 00:03:00,1488,Beautiful fish and great pics. Thanks for sharing Bill.
1030150,crittermo,2018-06-22 03:56:00,2,"thanks art, your right, i I was planning to take my 9 year old son to the secret lake and fish it clean. if i had the time to go fish all 10,000 lakes in ontario to figure it out for myself then i would understand, what kind of a board are you running. so we all just look at pictures and tell people how awesome they are. if the posters want to tell what lakes they are fishing then good for them. wow, i mean really, wow, what, i should have expected as much from canada"
1030154,AKRISONER,2018-06-22 10:58:00,5558,dude...you have two posts and you already found a way to get butt hurt?  Look at yourself lol  here fill this out it might help  
1030183,LostAnotherOne,2018-06-22 20:46:00,956,Nice catch.  Im sure your inbox is full lol.  You sure know how to catch that big one with several different species of fish.  Nothing beats having the better half land some beauts too.
1030184,chris.brock,2018-06-22 22:14:00,4053,"How about this, if you don't like Canada we probably don't like you either and don't want you up here. Loose lips sink ships, I've seen it happen plenty of times."
1030187,aplumma,2018-06-22 22:46:00,6896,Issue solved back to the nice fish porn. Art
1030188,farsider,2018-06-22 23:39:00,456,Nicely done Bill!  Thanks for posting
1030219,Moosebunk,2018-06-23 23:09:00,3970,"Imagine you miss your Pops a little, but she's cuter, probably snores less and is much cozier at nights. ;) Maybe we crossed paths on the highway, dunno?  My buddy and I took our wives for the first time. Bren only put me off for 10 years for this trip.  A few reasons we couldn't pike fish much and didn't have the success you two did.  All over other parts of the lake I wondered how the fishing and traffic would be where you were?  Knew you had postponed but made the trip and figured on where you'd be. Pike fishing there is second to none in our Province and rivals many of the big trophy pike fisheries. 47 is a great one Bill.  Much better in her arms. The 50's are waiting though..."
1030345,pics,2018-06-26 20:31:00,1268,I just got back Sunday from the Nipigon area... We only had one fish in the 38 inch range but we fished mostly small back lakes for Walleye..
1030366,Ron,2018-06-27 12:45:00,1683,"Wow, And to think we were ("") this close to meeting up. I should have taken pictures of you and your lovely girlfirend. We came into the one bay and we asked if you guys were at the camp on the island as I mistook you for another couple. I asked why you weren't chucking with the fly rod. We kept our distance as you had the fish cornered. LOL There were a lot of sore lips out there that week. Cheers, Ron..."
1030368,BillM,2018-06-27 13:38:00,17367,"That was you?!?!??!    Crap man, I wish I would have recognized your boat!  lol!!    Maybe we all need big OFC stickers with our usernames on them"
1030374,misfish,2018-06-27 15:41:00,29133,Glad  I was not the only one Ron. SEE Bill. LOL
1030375,BillM,2018-06-27 15:46:00,17367,"Brian tie me some monsters and I'll toss them next year, lol!"
1030379,Tom S,2018-06-27 16:15:00,362,I’ve got an 11wt that could use a workout if you are interested for next year. You’ll be a bit outgunned with your 6wt.
1030391,BillM,2018-06-27 21:58:00,17367,"Tom, I wouldn't even attempt it with my 6wt.   I'll hit you up next year and see if that 11wt is still available"
1030393,misfish,2018-06-27 22:28:00,29133,Your on Bill.
1030419,Tom S,2018-06-28 19:12:00,362,Heh heh. You better call up every deer hunter you know and start collecting bucktail this fall.
1029894,BillM,2018-06-17 18:46:00,17367,"Just got back from northwestern Ontario and some great pike fishing.   I love these things, especially chasing giants in 2ft of water or less.   Biggest fish of the trip was 47in, saw ones much bigger but they were rather uninterested in my presentations but did enjoy sunning themselves    Surprise 29in walleye to finish the trip off as well!   The 47in was one of the thickest pike I've ever seen, shoulders on these fish (Even the high 30in fish) were insane.    You'll also notice no GoPro shots and fish being held 8ft away from us.  No need to camera tricks with these things.    Our best day was 12 over 40inches,  I caught 4, 42inchers in an afternoon but of course she got all the big ones, lol.   Can't complain, her first time pike fishing, she definitely got spoiled!  Biggest for me on this trip was 45in, I'll be chasing that 50 next spring.   No weights on these fish, just a quick measurement, pic then back they went.  47in giant..  she could barely hold on to it. https://i.imgur.com/NGBwq8j.jpg[/img] Bonus walleye!  Hit a Dr spoon, not surprised I've caught some pretty big walleye on pike gear "
1029901,chris.brock,2018-06-17 19:53:00,4053,"That's some serious, big spring pikes! It sounds like you've got a good fishing partner there too. You guys tenting or in a cabin? "
1029902,BillM,2018-06-17 19:55:00,17367,"Thanks Chris, she didn't complain about the long days we had and caught a lot of giants.  We camped."
1029903,spincast,2018-06-17 20:29:00,3279,sweet. Love it when those big shouldered rockets slam the presentation?
1029910,Raf,2018-06-17 22:36:00,3495,nice shootn bill.
1029911,RickOnt,2018-06-17 23:06:00,669,Hey Bill        Some beauty Pike  Well  done!!   The girlfriend  is a 'Keeper' for sure!!  My days of sleeping on the ground are long gone!!  Thanks for posting Rick
1029916,msp,2018-06-18 11:33:00,1336,Whoa ! Well done Bill. Slaying BIG hens. Sorry I couldn't make it this year. I guess I will have to go next year
1029920,AKRISONER,2018-06-18 13:44:00,5558,"man, now those are some seriously monster pike. What was the go to lure for the week?  Also some of the photos aren't working now? I cant see the walleye for example."
1029922,PUMP KNOWS,2018-06-18 13:58:00,937,Sweet catches :)
1029923,JoshS,2018-06-18 14:07:00,729,Great work! Looks like an awesome time. Big pike!!! My wife will do 3-4hrs maybe max and most of that time is reading a book lol
1029926,BillM,2018-06-18 14:28:00,17367,"We caught them on everything, although each day kinda had its own pattern.    Walleye pic should be fixed, dunno how that happened."
1029928,AKRISONER,2018-06-18 14:32:00,5558,is it just me or does that walleye remind you of a bowfin...its heads shape is kinda fat! crazy looking fish.
1029935,BillM,2018-06-18 15:32:00,17367,"I thought I had a big pike on to be honest with the way it was staying down,  then I saw the head and just started to laugh."
1029936,Freshtrax,2018-06-18 15:37:00,2215,Good going. Looks like the water warmed up since I was up there.
1029937,mistaredone,2018-06-18 16:07:00,913,Wow!!  Some big pike there!
1029939,jimmer,2018-06-18 16:12:00,2730,"FISH PICTURES! Thanks for sharing, it looks like you had a blast."
1029941,misfish,2018-06-18 16:39:00,29133,What ? Didn't bring the fly rod ? That would of been cool. Sweet fish buddy.
1029942,BillM,2018-06-18 16:52:00,17367,My 6wt would have been destroyed    Maybe next year I'll pick up a heavy stick and bring it along.
1029950,Joeytier,2018-06-18 17:49:00,3990,I'd deem that a successful trip...amazing average for sure.  That big eye looks like she still hasnt bulked up from the spawn.
1029951,BillM,2018-06-18 17:53:00,17367,"Big head and skinny body, I was thinking the same thing.  I interrupted her trip back to the lake"
1029955,grimsbylander,2018-06-18 18:28:00,3016,Great trip and really nice fish. That shallow water hunting must have been a blast.
1029956,PUMP KNOWS,2018-06-18 18:34:00,937,"Yup, I see it.  I guess it fought like one too"
1029974,Rizzo,2018-06-18 22:10:00,4754,wow...that is all I have to say!
1029977,MJL,2018-06-18 22:44:00,2427,This must be Florida...I've never seen gators that big.Haha  Nice Bill! Totally agree with you on the photography aspect of hero shots. Big fish don't need help looking big
1029979,Pikeslayer,2018-06-18 23:43:00,1443,??? Nice shootin' Bill.
