I'm going to be staying at the south end of the lake, and have access to a small boat/motor(too small to go all around the lake but can fish a few small bays maybe). Is there anywhere near there I could get a few pan fish to keep the kids happy? Either from the boat or shore."
1030752,adempsey,2018-07-05 21:07:00,1498,"Well, if there are panfish that's probably where they will be.  I've only fished it during ice season as well.  I'd probably fish the bottom 1/3 of the lake for panfish if that was what I was after.  The upper 2/3 is quite deep for the most part.  I did hear people used to catch rainbows near some of the incoming streams, but that was probably in the spring and maybe just people talking.  There is a nice hump near deeper water at the south end that you could always troll for some lakers :).  Rubber band with 2-3oz bell sinkers and away you go."

I have a very close friend that owns a cottage at the south end of the lake   near the girls camp. on the west side of the south end there is a nice shoal that drops off to deeper water and we found some nice 10 inch plus perch more than a few times over the years. we actually caught some nice size bows trolling shallow not far from the east shore, 10 pound plus. if I remember right we used lake erie walleye deep divers that go down around 15 feet only. a huge drop off very close to shoreno dipsy's, jet divers or heavy snap wts. it was the middle of august a few years back. left my boat at home and fished out of hid 14' tinny and 9.9. I love that lake and the bar in Sundridge good music and cold beer. think its called the caswell or something. sorry no capitals, woke at 3am and it felt like I broke my wrist. condra calcinosis. did nothing yesterday except use ratchet straps to tie down a counter top.
