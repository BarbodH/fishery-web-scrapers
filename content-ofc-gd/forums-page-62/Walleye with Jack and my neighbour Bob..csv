My next door neighbour Bob saw us headed down the lawn with bait and joined us to Jack's delight, I also love it when Bob tags along, really great guy.  "

1030865,OhioFisherman,2018-07-09 02:11:00,6623,"Great! Looks like you had a fun outing! A couple of questions, how is the guiding going for you? I noticed water being pumped out on the right side of the boat a few times, does your livewell pump it out? or bilge pump cycling?"
1030870,limeyangler,2018-07-09 10:54:00,5204,"Its a leak in the live well line, turn on the live well and the boat fills with water, so when i'm keeping fish I have to have bilge and live well running or we are going down....lol. "
1030877,OhioFisherman,2018-07-09 13:45:00,6623,"OK, that explains that, my boat was older and I haven't really kept upÂ  with the newer technologies, water did seem to be coming out of a livewell a lot stronger than it did out of mine. Hope it is an easy fix for you."
