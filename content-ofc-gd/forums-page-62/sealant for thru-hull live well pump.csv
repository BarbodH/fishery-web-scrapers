1030639,porkpie,2018-07-03 17:37:00,2521,"4200 is supposed to come off.  I have used it in the past and it has remained watertight.  If your just replacing the pump,  in the original inlet and not cutting any new holes, 4200 should do the trick and keep you dry!"
1030670,Raf,2018-07-03 21:35:00,3495,"Thank you.  I got some 4200.  Yes, just replacing the existing pump.  Now for the heatwave to break."
