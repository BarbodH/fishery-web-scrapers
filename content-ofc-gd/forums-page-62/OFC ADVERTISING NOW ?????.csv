1030032,misfish,2018-06-20 20:19:00,29133,Got a kinda advert in my email today  More of a advertising promo for OFC.  Anyone else ?
1030034,Terry,2018-06-20 20:22:00,14456,WAs it this  Pictures:  OFC Weekly Fishing Report Update and Latest Outdoor News    in your setting you have given them permission to send the email   would be my guess
1030035,misfish,2018-06-20 20:27:00,29133,"You forgot the advert part.  NOT THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT  The Ontario Fishing Community was started back in March of 2011. We are an online community interested in the many fishing opportunities in the province of Ontario.  We are a community composed of professional and amateur fishermen; charter captains; environmentalists; hunters; outdoor enthusiasts; and men, women, and children of all ages with the goal of environmental preservation and sustainablity.   Just asking a question here."
1030052,aplumma,2018-06-20 21:53:00,6896,We send out a monthly e mail to all of the members to show them a sample of what is going on to see if they want to visit more often. We are hoping to get the site to pay for all of the security and program upgrades we are doing to enhance the site. If you do not wish to receive it you can opt out in your settings/ other settings under your profile. We hope in the future to add some of the other projects that T.J. has cooking. We will have to see if we can do it without burning out our I.T. Blueye aka Chad. Thanks to everyone and Chad for helping us do some much needed maintainance Art
1030054,BlueEye,2018-06-20 22:10:00,338,Yeah there is also an unsubscribe in email footer if you wish to opt out anytime.  It’s a nice non-spam email just to keep members in the know. Thanks again
1030056,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-20 22:22:00,8243,"Very good move. I get monthly emails from most of the forums that I am a member of andit does remind me to visit more often. Hi BlueEye, I still can't PM anyone. When I hover the window for ""Follow Member or ""Message"" the cursor stays as an arrow. Any thoughts?"
1030057,misfish,2018-06-20 22:25:00,29133,"All good here, It was just a question. What ever it takes to bring OFC back to what it was."
1030059,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-20 22:32:00,8243,"Catch more fish, or in my case get a body transplant and go fishing."
1030064,lunkerbasshunter,2018-06-20 23:03:00,2585,I like the monthly email.  it allows me to take a break from work and look at reports and see whats going on. Cheers!
1030173,ratherboutdoors,2018-06-22 18:24:00,132,"I have no problem with it either, and if it makes some extra $$$ to make the site better than that's the least I can do."
1030299,iFish4real,2018-06-25 14:29:00,386,We saw an advert for OFC on a billboard on HMY 17 in Sturgeon Falls Didn't know if it was real or some fan put it up
1030305,misfish,2018-06-25 15:42:00,29133,"ITS REEL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  DATS WERE DA BOSS LIVES"
