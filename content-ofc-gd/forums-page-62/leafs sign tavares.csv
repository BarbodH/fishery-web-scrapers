1030540,BillM,2018-07-01 20:07:00,17367,Where are these mythical D men that were ready to sign?
1030549,leaf4,2018-07-02 00:00:00,2466,Who needs defence when you have this much offense! ?
1030555,grimsbylander,2018-07-02 01:41:00,3016,It's not everyday a player at JT's caliber comes along and wants to play on your team enough to leave upwards of $14M on the table. Let him go and shop defense? lol Tavaras with Marner & Matthews with Nylander...Ohhh yeah!
