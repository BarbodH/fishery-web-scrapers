1030757,captpierre,2018-07-05 22:26:00,2521,Just announced
1030758,craigdritchie,2018-07-05 22:44:00,1586,"Old news. https://plus.ibinews.com/2018/06/28/alumacraft_sold/ Also over the last couple of weeks: Polaris buys Bennington, Rinker, Hurricane and Godfrey ( http://www.polaris.com/en-us/company/article/polaris-industries-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-boat-holdings-llc ) ..... Winnebago buys Chris-Craft ( https://www.tradeonlytoday.com/industry-news/winnebago-buys-chris-craft ) and C-Map merges with Navico (parent company of Lowrance ... https://plus.ibinews.com/2018/07/02/navico_and_c-map_announce_merger/ ).    Lots of consolidation and new players in the boat industry!"
1030764,John Bacon,2018-07-06 01:20:00,3277,I think the lack of their own boats has been hampering their sales.  This should help them build up their sales. 
1030773,Mister G,2018-07-06 11:01:00,1429,Not sure if this is good or bad for us E-TEC owners.......
1030774,AKRISONER,2018-07-06 11:19:00,5558,"ughhhh As an alumacraft owner, this is very very very disappointing. Anything Bombardier has gone to the complete pooper if you ask me. Bad news all around. Glad we got one when you could still get a yamaha put on em...not anymore!"
1030776,2 tone z71,2018-07-06 11:32:00,1311,Agreed
1030778,captpierre,2018-07-06 12:36:00,2521,Not sure what you mean.    I hear E-Tecs are pretty good. CanAm makes a decent ATV and Seadoo is the PWC  leader. What is the concern?
1030780,BassMan11,2018-07-06 13:34:00,583,No issues with my 09 E-tec 75 tiller. Like anything... if you take care of things properly they seldom let you down. That said there are always lemons across all manufacturers. Good move by BRP.
1030781,AKRISONER,2018-07-06 13:34:00,5558,"i own two ski poos... and that companies track record of producing total garbage over the last couple of decades is well publicized. Just look at Toronto's contracts with Bombardier for its TTC vehicles, they are all complete garbage. My whole family used to be a Ford motors, Bombardier products, domestic outboards family, we have completely moved away from buying any domestic motorized vehicles at all. They are nothing but problems, this goes right up to 2 years ago buying my truck. I just bought a used boat and i made damn well sure it was outfitted with a yamaha. Surprise surprise the only things we have never had issues with are our suzuki and yamaha outboards, and my old man's acura SUV."
1030782,John Bacon,2018-07-06 13:41:00,3277,"That's a completely different company, and has been for about 15 years now."
1030784,John Bacon,2018-07-06 13:48:00,3277,I don't think it will make any difference to current E-Tec owners.  People who want to pair an E-Tec with an Alumacraft will probably get a better deal in the future. You'll still be able to pair an Alumacraft to a Yamaha if you want.  You just won't get the discount for taking an all BRP package.
