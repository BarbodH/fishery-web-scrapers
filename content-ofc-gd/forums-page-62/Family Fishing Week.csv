1030440,captpierre,2018-06-29 12:19:00,2521,Waterways will be extra busy this week. No license required. The fish will see a lot of lures. I might go strawberry picking instead.
1030445,Acountdeleted,2018-06-29 13:35:00,2562,"A good weekend to find lakes that motor boats and the general public can't access. Man do I love owning a kayak.  Agreed though, big water and boat launches are going to be very very busy."
1030450,jimmer,2018-06-29 14:22:00,2730,I will probably avoid the water this weekend.
1030456,OhioFisherman,2018-06-29 14:47:00,6623,"Heat index temps are predicted to be 100+ degrees here for the next few days, it maybe a better time to swim with the fishes than to sit in a boat and try to catch them!"
1030478,misfish,2018-06-29 20:46:00,29133,"On the water before light, and off when it gets hot and busy.  Living local has it perks.  PLAY SAFE ALL"
1030493,ketchenany,2018-06-29 23:52:00,3229,The early bird get the worm! And that you are.
1030494,Terry,2018-06-30 01:13:00,14456,Did you just call him a worm  ...lol
1030500,Joeytier,2018-06-30 03:31:00,3990,"Too hot, too busy.  I'll gladly wait for the tourists to go home and the mercury to drop."
1030531,spincast,2018-07-01 16:52:00,3279,"Fishing opportunities are too scarce for me to pass on any of them.  G & I headed out at Misfish time, set up by 6:30, on the way home by 10:00 The lunatics were still sleeping      "
1030533,Terry,2018-07-01 16:59:00,14456,Nice fishies there
1030565,Joeytier,2018-07-02 16:16:00,3990,"Beat the heat and the crowds, perfect. "
1030589,Acountdeleted,2018-07-02 22:57:00,2562,Worked out well for us at the cottage as well. All fish were caught half an hour before sunrise and half an hour after sunset. Think we ended up with 10 pretty good bass in total. (And think my mom hooked and lost a snapping turtle. XD XD)  also lets see if the pic works of me and the wife with the double header.
