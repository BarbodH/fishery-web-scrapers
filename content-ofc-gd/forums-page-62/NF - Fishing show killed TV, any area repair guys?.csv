Its a cheap Sanyo only a couple years old and was working fine and hate the idea of chucking a whole TV due to 1 blown cap or chip... Went thru the youtube trying to troubleshoot but I'm a hack electronic guy at best. Anyone in the Hamilton area do repairs that will end up under the price of a new unit? Costco has 55"" 4K cheapies in the $500 range so not sure its even feasible to repair 3 yr old unit..."

It was happening alot and I thought maybe it was kaput after only 3 years, then I wondered if a connection had come loose with expanding and contracting with the crazy hot weather lately. Sure enough I tightened everything up and it's now working perfectly again. Just a shot in the dark but maybe give it a try and see what happens.  "
1030672,ketchenany,2018-07-03 22:25:00,3229,"I agree with Lew here. Mine did the same thing - not supported message. Gave the cable guys a call and if they came and it wasn't them $75. But go buy a HDMI cable. IT’S your cable, still have to buy it. CT 12.99, dollar store  3.99. The cheap one works fine. And after buying it I find two in a drawer. Worth try if the connection is gone. Can always return it."
1030678,misfish,2018-07-03 23:26:00,29133,Power surges will cause the same thing. Trust me I know. I have 6 robots at work. I find connections that have jumped off their connections.
1030683,smitty55,2018-07-04 01:36:00,928,"If you can get the back cover off there is likely a fuse in the power supply that you could check for continuity. Otherwise look for swollen capacitors with a bulging top or bottom and just give a general scope out for signs of anything burnt like a track or other component. Capacitors are generally the first component to go in most circuits, I've had to repair three satellite receivers and in each case it was a capacitor. Good luck.  Cheers"
1030685,Loonietoon,2018-07-04 02:44:00,1450,There is a guy on Barton St by Kenilworth call Branko Audio 905-545-8952  I believe the name is. Fixed mine for $100.00 new power supply might try him he will check it out and tell you if it is worth fixing...
1030779,Raycaster,2018-07-06 13:26:00,528,"Thx for the replies guys, sucks as not a simple visual repair. Will give Branko a call, again thx. "
