1030463,Bill Shearer,2018-06-29 16:50:00,456,Double cotton jacket rubber lined 65mm is best. To make even more effective put a small pool noodle inside. Fasten every 2-3 feet and hide the nails in the edge above and below the noodle. No marks on the boat and  safe . Some fire depts cut the couplings off the hose and give away to members for this purpose. Know any firefighters who could ask the repair guy?

It's the larger of the 2 types they use, which looks like it should slide right over a 2X4. Maybe even a 2X6. I figure I'll slide it over whichever piece or wood I use, then pull it tight and staple or screw it down along the sides. Right or wrong way, I'm not too sure. "
