1030363,limeyangler,2018-06-27 12:23:00,5204,"As an avid Youtuber, who came to it late by modern standards I have to chime in....lol. I think comparing Youtube to the likes of WFN is an apples and oranges situation. Like any media platform there is going to be stuff you like and stuff you don't, there are some amazing fishing channels and some really awful ones, that being said Youtube does offer average Joes like me the chance to share content that just does not happen in the corporate world of WFN et al.  Youtube also allows a degree of interaction not possible with TV shows, I have a good rapport, instant rapport, with subscribers and have made friends with some and even had meet ups. There are some amazingly good fishermen and women in my area who don't fish tournaments, it's just not their thing. I am in awe of some of the local guys that year in and year out deliver on the competitive stage, I have tried before with mixed results, but for me it takes the fun out of fishing (unless you win....lol). A lot of my subscribers have little interest in my fishing abilities, they tune in because of the cool places I get to fish, the rapport I have with them, my dog, my family, especially Jack my young son, scenery etc...etc. I have had some lucrative offers for sponsorship but I am not going down that route just yet, I think it would take away from my content and make it into an infomercial, the very reason I never watch WFN, instead I chose to air my videos on local TV, folks in our area get a real hoot out of seeing the places they know and I have had some very possitive feedback, thats enough for me. So, in summary....lol...WFN is good if thats your thing, youtube is also great if thats your thing, but they are very different entities."

1030382,Garnet,2018-06-27 16:34:00,2056,I subscribed to it and a company I do shows asked me about it. Think they did something with him. It was a little bit to much travel for me .
1030389,PUMP KNOWS,2018-06-27 20:00:00,937,It's nice seeing full episodes posted on youtube.  Looks like most Fishing shows are doing it. I rarely watch TV these days unless it's sports.
1030592,Joeytier,2018-07-03 00:29:00,3990,"Angling skill is right near the bottom of things I look for in most fishing/outdoors media.  Some of the most enjoyable outdoors content online are from people that are new to the sport and/or trying new things.  I have no doubt that Italo and Bob are excellent anglers, but their shows are incredibly dull and inundanted with advertisements to the point that they are no longer enjoyable to most people.  Not to mention, if you don't think there's world class anglers on YouTube, you're clueless."
1030602,Garnet,2018-07-03 10:19:00,2056,I love your passion .  And there names are.
1030612,limeyangler,2018-07-03 13:23:00,5204,ME!   lolololol. ?
1030613,AKRISONER,2018-07-03 13:30:00,5558,"if you want to watch good fishing shows, watch uncut angling, 49 hours and tactical bassin, done and done."
1030615,grimsbylander,2018-07-03 13:36:00,3016,"I'm the complete opposite. I don't watch an outdoors show so someone can entertain me. If there's nothing to learn, for me, there's no sense in watching. They should just hire actors to do fishing shows. lol"
1030628,Garnet,2018-07-03 15:38:00,2056,a couple are actors even a couple shoe salesmen.
1030172,Lord Letto,2018-06-22 18:24:00,70,I'm subscribed to The Fish'n Canada Show on Youtube & last week they started uploading episodes from Season 1 back in 1986! Episode 1 Episode 2
1030180,kickingfrog,2018-06-22 20:38:00,8333,It'd be a nice addition to a man cave to have the diorama of the different classifications of lake they used to use in those early days.
1030193,Rizzo,2018-06-23 11:46:00,4754,wow that many years making a living fishing. Good for them!
1030196,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-23 15:21:00,8243,"Fishin' Canada and all the rest. 30 minutes of flogging everything from tackle to tires and everything in between. I had WFN with my Bell package and cancelled it, those shows drive me nuts. Fishin Canada is now a 1/2 infomercial for Cooper Tires and Ram trucks. I don't think Angelo Viola and Pete Bowman should be giving exact GPS co ordinates to the ramps. I had better log off, I have 2 pals and my wife putting in a new kitchen and I told them I searching Google for door handles."
1030207,SirCranksalot,2018-06-23 19:52:00,3291,Didn't 1 of those guys get busted for poaching? 
1030282,Toronto_Angler,2018-06-25 02:57:00,698,"Loved watching fish'n canada, izumi and Canadian Sportfishing with italo and Henry growing up."
1030284,ehg,2018-06-25 06:22:00,2666,"I think it was Italo of Canadian Sportfishing.  Anyways, i remember delivering newspapers to the Violas on Wecker Dr. in Oshawa.  This was in 1981, i was 12. Didn't know them, thought they were gay. Later found out were brothers opened Barclays off 401 in Oshawa. "
1030285,dave524,2018-06-25 10:14:00,4508,Henry got busted too about the same time   https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/fishing-host-fined-for-illegal-angling-1.165298
1030287,Duckie,2018-06-25 13:15:00,305,"yeah, Henry and Italo really black painted all fishing shows with that scandal. everyone assumed they all were doing that and if im not mistaken they claimed everyone was. Now Henry has been down in Florida for years making ""fishing the flats"" and Italo is still on TV with Canadian Sport Fishing. They got busted fishing out of season and taking someone elses fish and putting it on the end of their line. "
1030289,Terry,2018-06-25 13:23:00,14456,"yup, Henry and Italo Fish'n Canada was the ones who decided to change their format to Gangst they all wore black, lots of bleeping out on the show from swearing they slapped the bass down back into the water and harassed the driver of their RV while driving down the road it was sad and embarrassing, to fishermen everywhere "
1030306,BillM,2018-06-25 16:11:00,17367,"A buddy of mine has guided some very well known TV hosts that were filming episodes.   The stories he tells me are pretty crazy.    Fish caught by other anglers used in the show, fish caught by himself and re-hooked, lol.  Anything for that shot I guess."
1030310,Jds63,2018-06-25 17:15:00,1365,I can’t understand how the networks still get sponsors for those shows ... especially Fish TV... some of the best fishing videos are on youtube channels... way more informative and in many ways filmed better ...
1030316,SirCranksalot,2018-06-25 20:32:00,3291,So why or how did Cdn Sports Fishing carry on with a known poacher???
1030317,BillM,2018-06-25 21:01:00,17367,"They got busted for snagging and Henry got busted for fishing bass a week before the opener, lol."
1030329,KawarthaAngler,2018-06-26 13:21:00,273,"Crap like that happens all the time on the supposed 'reality' tv shows. I know an outdoors man that writes for a column, teaches, etc.  He did a small bit for a reality tv show where he camped the night in an old jail.  Suppose to be haunted, etc.  The idea was suppose to be unique, fun, novel, etc.  He said the next day when the crew returned and had nothing interesting to show (no ghosts or strange activity while he camped out) they fabricated some stuff. Just like Ma and Pa use to say ..... 'you can't believe everything you see on TV'."
1030331,jimmer,2018-06-26 14:26:00,2730,The fishing industry is booming and advertisers want their info out there.
1030333,KawarthaAngler,2018-06-26 15:07:00,273,"I agree but I think it's a demographics thing. I see this first hand in my family.  My kids are late teens and they watch almost all video via portable device and YouTube.  Then there is me, I do 50/50 YouTube channels I follow and PVR some of the shows on TV.  Then there are my parents, where they never go to YouTube and do all watching traditional TV."
1030336,Garnet,2018-06-26 16:24:00,2056,Most you tube or a lot are made by fly weight anglers. With no credits nothing  to prove angling skill. And just as boring as fishing shows.  
1030339,grimsbylander,2018-06-26 18:53:00,3016,"I agree. I don't consider a 20 something that spent time on google a worthy authority on fishing. Ambitious, yes."
1030341,Jds63,2018-06-26 19:43:00,1365,"like anything you have to find the folks that know what they are doing and you can tell they have put in their time, there are lot of guys with Youtube channels that have way more credibility as anglers than some of those on TV ..."
1030351,Garnet,2018-06-26 22:44:00,2056,I've fished against many TV anglers. And I know how good they are. Can't think of 1 YouTube worth my time. 
1030354,grimsbylander,2018-06-26 23:25:00,3016,Sounds good. Post their links please.
1030355,grimsbylander,2018-06-26 23:29:00,3016,That's it right there. It's one thing to record a show with the ability to edit the crap out of it and another thing to have the guts to fish competitively when you have a show. Izumi has forgotten more than most people know.
1030359,Garnet,2018-06-27 10:12:00,2056,I fished against Bob when he was parking his rig at Barkly's to go on dates with girlfriend and still his wife. You needed your A game to beat Bob then and every years since then. That's impressive. The Itlo  and Henry  thing is way more complicated than stated here. They still don't get a free pass from me. Itlo is 1 of the best multi specie anglers in the world  and to this day if shows up at a tournament he is hard to beat.
1030362,SirCranksalot,2018-06-27 12:03:00,3291,"Too bad Mike Borger doesn't have a Yuotube channel, or a TV show!! That would make me drool!"
