1030696,BillM,2018-07-04 18:09:00,17367,Can't blame them after reading that article.
1030746,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-05 18:05:00,937,Is the pier still closed off?
1030749,Snidley,2018-07-05 19:18:00,620,"That's a great spot for fishing but a bad spot for confrontation. With shore anglers now blocked from fishing the pier and marina  it will resolve the issues that used to happen between shore anglers and boat anglers at Dalousie. They can block shore anglers because tresspassing is a local juristiction, fishing in a boat, on the water, on navigable waters is a provincial juristiction and therefore boat anglers are well within their rights to fish in and around Dalousie while shore anglers can and probably will be charged with fishing while trespassing which I believe is a $500+ fine. I have fished there myself in the past and truthfully  the shore anglers are generally a motley clique of fellows who carry on in selfish and destructive ways to the area and to fishing in general. Good riddence if the land based guys are blocked from the area."
