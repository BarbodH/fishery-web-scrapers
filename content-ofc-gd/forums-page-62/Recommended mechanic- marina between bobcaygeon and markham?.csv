1030194,wask,2018-06-23 14:21:00,174,Hey guys I have a 70 HP 1985 Johnson i just bought and it was cheap so it of course has issues. its feul starved so I assume the carbs need cleaned out or (hopefully not) rebuilt. i live in Markham but the boat is south of Gooderham so I can drop it anywhere between here and there. looking for someone I can trust who isn’t going to take me for an unecessary ride.  who do you trust? thanks in advance as always  .
