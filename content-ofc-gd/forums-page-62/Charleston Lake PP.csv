1030327,mitch seguin,2018-06-26 10:51:00,98,Excellent lm and sm bass.  Fair lake trout and pike.
1030334,mamona,2018-06-26 15:31:00,597,Any suggestions which part of the lake would be most productive for bass and pike?
1030338,smitty55,2018-06-26 18:31:00,928,"Midsummer Pike fishing is minimal at best as the good sized ones hold near deep water. There is a large weed bed between Flat and Rabbit islands across Big Water that could hold some Pike still but for the most part you would have to target the deep edge in 25 fow. Good luck, it's a real nice lake.  Cheers"
