He has video of the whole thing...they did the same kinds of things...people passed out, puked etc.....  He'd do it again in a heartbeat!!  I think it cost $800 per person for about 20 minutes in the air."
135517,Terry,2007-11-21 15:48:00,14456,that was just great  and that would be fun to try   I love the black outs
135576,Spiel,2007-11-21 18:10:00,9065,Oh man I'd love to try that! I've no doubt that I'd pass out as well and that's probably why I was laughing so hard everytime Steve did.
135642,TennesseeGuy,2007-11-21 21:03:00,957,I really enjoyed it.  Not sure if I need that ride.  Saying I'd do it would be easy.  Doing it is a different story.  Probably not for me.
