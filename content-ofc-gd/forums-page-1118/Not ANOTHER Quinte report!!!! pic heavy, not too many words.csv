Wayne, Mike and Terry   The docking arrangements leave a lot to be desired, here is one of the victims, Gerritt   Joe, cooking some of those killer vegs!!!   Peter and the lovely Joey   Ok, here is my arguement, this is a species of esox, of which the pickeral is also a member, so why didnt I win the tourney????     You want extreme fishing? Ted was actually using his filet knife to scrape his rides windshield!!   Catch of the day!   Worshipping at the feet of Walleye Dan, why you ask? Because I get results!!!!!   See?   Fish in the boat.   Lovely golden colour...at this point I figured if I caught a sheephead, I'd have a Quinte grand slam!!  I had a wonderful time, fished with some good people, hung out with some good people and had a lot of laughs. Thanks to all who were there."
