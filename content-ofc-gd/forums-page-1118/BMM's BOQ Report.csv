I'm thankful to a few people who made it all happen. I was supposed to have a partner for the trip but he backed out on me last second so i had to make other arrangements so i posted on the BOQ thread and noticed Brian (Slowpoke) was asking if anyone needed a ride well i was in on that. Thanks for the Ride and the company Brian. Since i was not bringing my boat he also offered me a spot in his boat. I also found my accommodations this way asking if anyone wanted to split a cottage or had an extra spot for a straggler LOL A few more people came to my rescue Shelly (Lady Walleye), Chuck (Big Chevy 4x4) Joey & Tybo and Roy Thanks so much guys it was great bunking with you's.  It was really good that Merlands screwed up the reservation cause we landed in this beauty for the first night!!! <a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/DSC02549.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photo Sharing and Video Hosting at Photobucket""></a>   The next day we had to move to a little smaller cottage but it was great too!   Well the first night was really windy and we ended up hanging out meeting people and and talking about tomorrows Strategy..   Well the next day after a headache and a puke!! Brian and I headed out to see if he could put me on my first Walleye and sure enough he comes through for me! 4.5 lbs not too shabby......   See how happy he is for me!!!   The next day we head out again with Carol (Bly) to see if we can get Brian his PB. and land a few more for the team!!! Sure enough he comes through again. 9.6 lbs    Smile for the camera!!!
