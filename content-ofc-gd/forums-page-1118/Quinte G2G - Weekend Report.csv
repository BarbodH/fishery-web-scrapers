134571,Joey,2007-11-19 03:24:00,9122,Great report and pics Cliff.  Its great to see the weekend you just had from another person's point of view  And kudos to Sam from Carra Outdoors for his generosity.  That was a nice surprise I bet.  Joey
134576,danc,2007-11-19 03:32:00,4677,Awesome report Cliff. I always had the feeling that Sam was a great guy and your report seals the deal. Way to go Sam.
134586,tbayboy,2007-11-19 03:57:00,1497,"Been waiting all weekend for the reports to start trickling in and had a feeling Cliff might be first.  Why was not suprised to hear that it was bly that had one on from shore - I'm gonna guess the red devil (or blue and white crank), do I win  Sounds like it was a great time even if the fishing wasn't the greatest.  Love hearing about the good Karma - Sam and Mr. Mercer coming through big time."
134615,solopaddler,2007-11-19 12:04:00,8605,"Nice report Cliff, sounds like a great time despite the slow fishing!"
134624,Rich Clemens,2007-11-19 12:22:00,3131,"Great report Cliff.   Looks a wee bit cold out there, but I'm sure the camaraderie warmed everyone up.  Wishin I would have been there."

134703,LeXXington,2007-11-19 16:25:00,1928," I TAKE OFFECE to this, I had 2 almost record SHAD, athough they were out of season and released. Wish I got a picture for proof  it must have been at least 4""  It was great bunking with you guys and fishing on the docks. You 2 are an amazing fishing team..  take care"

134708,bassmastermike,2007-11-19 16:45:00,295,Hey Cliff it was great seeing you again wish i could have gotten out with you and Carol together on sunday but i think 4 in the boat would have been a little tight!!!LOL... Hope to see you again soon BMM
134733,ccmtcanada,2007-11-19 19:15:00,7971, If you want to get technical about it then yes..you caught 2 fish...LOL.  I suppose that means I wasn't skunked that night either with my 1 shad caught.  It was fun spending some time with you as well...hopefully we'll meet up again at another G2G.
134739,PERCHER,2007-11-19 19:56:00,787,Great report Cliff.It was a real pleasure finally meeting you and Carole.Sorry I didn't stick around for the pot luck.But it was time to head home.Again Cliff and Carole it was a pleasure and I hope we can all get togetther again.  Dan
134807,addict,2007-11-19 23:19:00,475,nice report to bad the fishes didnt co operate.nice floater jacket that sure was a sweet deal.
134861,Greencoachdog,2007-11-20 01:43:00,8163,"It was great to see you and Carole again Cliff!!!  All y'all were the perfect roommates!  I was hopin' to get out fishin' with y'all but that cold weather kicked my but with a ""frozen boot!""  I think we both had about the same luck fishin'... but I think my Perch is bigger than yours!"
134864,Greencoachdog,2007-11-20 01:51:00,8163,   I heard that Caroles Wall-ice was knocked off the hook with a net on purpose by a jealous fisherman   that couldn't stand to be out-fished by a wimmins!
134871,Corey,2007-11-20 02:05:00,355,Ya dawg! and I witnessed it...
134884,Mike the Pike,2007-11-20 02:54:00,3421, Thats why you call them Wall-Ice Glen   .This one had too much ice on it and kept slippin out the net.S h e e t Happens.  What an awesome report Cliff nice jacket.It was great to meet you and Bly can't wait to fish with you both again.Too bad the Dog found it too cold to teach me all about the Sabiki rigs  MTP
134885,ccmtcanada,2007-11-20 02:57:00,7971," I didn't mention that part or names on purpose Glen...LOL.  Oh well, now that Mike has acknowledged it I guess I wont get many net jabs from him any time soon....LOL."
134887,ccmtcanada,2007-11-20 02:59:00,7971, Yes it does Mike....and I think you felt worse about it than Carole did about losing the fish.  We've both lost fish at the net....and it will happen again I'm sure.
134888,Greencoachdog,2007-11-20 03:00:00,8163,I witheld the names on purpose to see if the guilty party would chime in... worked like a charm!
