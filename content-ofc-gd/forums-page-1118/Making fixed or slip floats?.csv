I am going to use balsa wood, and I need to jimmy rig a lathe<< (help on this one), paint and gloss<<(suggestions). If I am missing something please post it.  Thanx in advance, Daniel OCH"
135200,bassjnkie,2007-11-20 23:07:00,1101,"No one makes floats, or knows any good sites.  Click thing ehh.   Oh well, Daniel OCH"
135205,FishFinder,2007-11-20 23:18:00,481,"You should be a little more patient, I make floats and could probably help you out with the basics, but some things are best learned through trial and error.  Cheers SkelWoods    "
135208,misfish,2007-11-20 23:22:00,29133,"I use to make my own floats years ago.I commend you for looking for a project to pass the time. I made up a stand and attached a regular drill to it.I then bought some balsam wood and 1/8 dowel to make the stems. Drilled a hole through a 2 inch square piece of balsum,pushed the dowel through with a bit of glue to hold.Then I put it in the drill and used a wood rasp file to create the shape then sanded smooth and applied dope seal to it, then painted. I cant explain to well typing,but they worked out just fine.They were not slip floats,they were floats that required surgical tubing to hold them to the line. Hope this helps abit. Enjoy   LOL Yep something like Skelzwoods. Nice floats there sir."
135212,solopaddler,2007-11-20 23:32:00,8605, Very impressive!
135265,bassjnkie,2007-11-21 01:15:00,1101,"SkelzWoods Very impressive floats. If you don't mind, I just need to know what you use to turn them, eg. lathe? Then I know I will figure it out, by screwing a couple floats up. Also where do you get your balsa wood from, and the tube for the slip floats?   Thanx in advance, Daniel OCH"
135277,FishFinder,2007-11-21 01:33:00,481,Balsa and the tubing comes from hobby shops. I turn them with a home made lathe i made out of an old dremel. Balsa is soft almost anything will work.
135280,Sinker,2007-11-21 01:36:00,8692,"I make them the same way as Misfish. On a drill, with balsa and 1/8 dowel. I started using the clear sticks, but they seem to break once in a while. I like the slip float tubes......gonna have to try that one!!  Sinker"

135503,bassjnkie,2007-11-21 15:16:00,1101,"Ok I jimmy rigged an cheap dramel tool as you did SkelzWoods. Where is the best palce to get the basla dowel? and what do you use for paint, acrylic or enamel?  Thanx, Daniel OCH"
