135064,tonyb,2007-11-20 16:25:00,1637,I've got one...$40/yr for a Non-Resident license.
135079,steverowbotham,2007-11-20 17:31:00,1800,40/yr for non-resident .... 15 for a day pass
135083,charlesn,2007-11-20 17:37:00,551,"Also there is a $25 for a 1-week non-resident license option.  Gander Mtn's bait shop is open at 5 AM if you're in a crunch and need a license that day.  For bass addicts like me, it is a must, otherwise you can't legally fish for bass until June which is crazy.  Charles"
135088,tipupesox,2007-11-20 18:03:00,167,I find it almost a must to have both a NYS and Ontario fishing license when fishing the Niagara as well as Lake Erie.  Better to be safe than sorry............  My friends have been telling me fishing in the upper river has been slow along with Buffalo harbor.  Tom
