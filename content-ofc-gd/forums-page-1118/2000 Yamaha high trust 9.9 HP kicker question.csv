135397,icefisherman,2007-11-21 05:14:00,952,"I am considering purchassing used 2000 Yamaha 9.9 HP , 4 stroke, long shaft, electric start, high trust motor. It says manufactured in 09/99 on it but apparently it is 2000 year model (?!?) What is good price for such motor at this time of the year? What would you consider ""deal I should not miss"" on it?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
135450,taper,2007-11-21 12:20:00,611,I can tell you that a 2006 8hp high thrust yamaha will set you back about $3400.
135494,icefisherman,2007-11-21 14:39:00,952," Thanks Taper,  waooooo....So would price of arround $1100-$1200 be considered ""great buy"" then?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
135588,kennyman,2007-11-21 18:45:00,737,"I'm no expert, but it seems like that woud be the going range for a ""newer"" small 9.9 outboard. For example there's a 2002 Yami on E-Bay with a buy it now of $1299. If you know who you're buying it from, that's a bonus for sure."
135592,icefisherman,2007-11-21 18:52:00,952,"  Keeny,  I think the motor you are reffeting is 2 stroke?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
