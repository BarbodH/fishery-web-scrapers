135167,Weeds,2007-11-20 21:57:00,782,"Hi. Topic title more or less states it all. I do alot of fishing for Pike along the Toronto waterfront on weekends, especially now that the Kawarthas have closed up shop for the season.  Now I have a great Musky rod but that just seems a little heavy duty for Piking along the T.O. waterfront; I know they have some monsters in there but at the same time there are quite a few hammer handles as well. I actually just purchased a medium 6 and a half foot St. Croix Baitcasting Rod for Toronto outings but it almost feels a little light for what I imagine a good pike rod would be (I've only ever caught one pike, it was about the size of a whole Mackerel you might get at a Restaurant). So....Suggestions....anyone? I've read a few articles and seen a few fishing shows where they actually suggest a medium power action rod but I'd like to hear others thoughts. Thanks, Ross"

I've used my cheapo BPS tourney medium as well though and didn't have any problem with the bigger guys either though a couple times I wished I had a bit more backbone."
135198,cranks bait,2007-11-20 23:01:00,721,"I have a 7' Crucial Baitcast Med that is alright for pike, I have landed a few 40"" with it.  I prefer to use my 7"" Compre baitcast that is med. heavy.  I still have the senitivity, but more power.  I also use a 7'2"" Cumara spinning Med. Heavy.  It also works really nice for the pike and bass.  I get a lot of feisty fish here in the St. Lawrence river, thus I prefer a med. heavy rod."
135306,snag,2007-11-21 02:28:00,1932,"I use MH 7' for both baitcast and spinning.  You will need to go deep and your gear needs strength for weeds, lure weight, distance and hauling a largish fish in an obtuse location.  I also have some back-up rods 6' to 8' for specific applications.  Tip: Leave your expensive rod at home if you are fishing below 0 degrees with a windchill.  Good luck!  S."
135342,GbayGiant,2007-11-21 03:05:00,1780,"Yep, I have no problem pulling them in on a medium walleye rod, but it would depend on lure weight/reel size/line diameter as well, I think a MH to H bass flipping rod 7-8' would probably be the best all around pike rod, I find musky rods are way to heavy even for the biggest pike and a medium action walleye rod can't handle heavy lures. So if I had to choose one I'd go with a MH or Heavy bass flipping rod or I'm sure some companies probably make Pike signatures, not sure but they would be similar to a flipping rod.  When you say medium it all depends because they always vary in strength, like a bass medium, walleye medium and musky medium are all way different but basically a MH bass would be good all around."
135351,Weeds,2007-11-21 03:18:00,782,Thanks for the replys. I'm kicking myself because when I picked up the medium action rod I could have just as easily gone with a medium heavy or even heavy. But.......I suppose this will have to do. For now. Until I can sneak one more rod into the house without the wife noticing.
135361,007,2007-11-21 03:28:00,537,Hey weeds  I use a 7ft Medium-Heavy BPS Tourney Special for casting lures for pike - caught a few small ones with it without any problems and also caught carp to 15lbs with it.  I'm hoping to give it a spin tomorrow along the TO waterfront/islands tomorrow - fingers crossed.  007
135379,Raf,2007-11-21 03:59:00,3495,"as mentioned the 7' mh is a great pike rod.. if you're shore trashing however, a longer rod may be a good idea.  this time of year i wouldn't be afraid of using an 8' muskie rod and throwing the big stuff for pike too."
135404,brickNblock,2007-11-21 06:28:00,598,"...yesir....Im thinking what Raf said, Maybe even 8-6 mh with a fast taper."
135505,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 15:21:00,7971,"Yep...medium heavy is my preference, but I have used medium with some success as well."
135543,Toronto_Angler,2007-11-21 16:53:00,698,Sorry to Hijack the topic. Are the Pike still biting at Harbourfront? The last few times I've been down the cabbage that is left is brown and dead and I couldn't even get a follow.
135835,Dabluz,2007-11-22 03:55:00,701,"For the past 10 or 15 years, I've been using 2 rods for pike.  Both rods are exactly the same.  They are 8 1/2 foot Berkley Steelhead Rods.  However, one was broken about 10 inches from the tip.  They have both been great so far.  I've just bought a MH fast action Team Daiwa 7 foot one piece rod that looks and feels fantastic but I have yet to use it.  To me, the rod I choose is more due to the type of lure and technique I am using than what sort of fish I am targeting."
135873,Rich,2007-11-22 06:56:00,3927,6'6 Medium action is all I use unless I'm after trophies (then I use my musky rod).
135921,addict,2007-11-22 13:17:00,475,7ft medium heavy baitcaster good for pike bass and anthing else that swims
135928,mistyjr1,2007-11-22 13:42:00,97,"I use 7' medium heavy like many it seems.  Caught a nice 36''er on one this year.  I know that this is a bit heavy for a pike but if you think there might be a chance you will be fishing somewhere with both muskie and pike, I have a Pete Maina 7' medium heavy, can definitely hold pike and can hold a good size muskie too. Combo with a nice reel is 200$.  My 3 cents  Mistyjr1"
136016,Burning Babies,2007-11-22 17:25:00,150,"In my limited experience with pike fishing, 6'6"" and 7' MHs have worked well as well.   Given that the OP's question has been pretty unanimously answered, perhaps I can add a similar one.  On the few occasions I have gotten to fish pike, I have spent a fair amount of time fishing bigger baits than a MH can really handle: 7"" Bomber long As, big 1 oz Reaper spinnerbaits, etc.  I have been using a Bass Pro Shops 7' H action, medium to slow power Spiralcell rod for these.  The action and overall length feels about right, but the 12"" handle feels too short, and I find casting it hard on the wrist.  I am considering a Pete Maina 7' MH rated for 1/2 to 2 oz lures, but I am concerned it might be too stiff:  I have a Maina 7'6"" MH which is way stiffer than I would want for this job, but it is also rated for far heavier baits (2-10 oz).  Does anyone have experience with this rod, or have an alternative recommendation with a similar length and handle size?  Edit: Jeeze; I didn't read Mistyjr1's post completely.   Is Maina pretty comfortable for throwing bigger pike baits?  How does the action feel compared to an MH bass or muskie rod.  I guess I'm looking for something in the middle."
