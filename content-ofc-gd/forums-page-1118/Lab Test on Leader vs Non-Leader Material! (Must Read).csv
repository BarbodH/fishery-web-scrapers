Strength: ================================= Maxima Perfection Leader Material broke @ 6.68-lbs Maxima Regular Ultragreen broke @ 6.64-lbs Stren Megathin broke @ 6.40-lbs  Diameter: ============================ Maxima Perfection Leader Material: 0.19mm Maxima Regular Ultragreen: 0.24mm Stren Megathin: 0.28mm  Cross-Section: =================================== Maxima Perfection Leader Material: consistently round Maxima Regular Ultragreen: consistently round Stren Megathin: lotsa deformation, inconsistent   Final Comparison:  Price per yard (Using Megathin as the base unit) ========================= Perfection Leader: 10.0x of Megathin Regular Ultragreen: 2.5x of Megathin  Diameter (Using Megathin as the base unit) ============================ Perfection Leader: 0.7x of Megathin Regular Ultragreen: 0.9x of Megathin  Strength per diameter (Using Megathin as the base unit) =================================== Perfection Leader: 1.5x of Megathin Regular Ultragreen: 1.2x of Megathin  In conclusion, Perfection Leader is only slightly better than the other two lines but the price is 5 to 10 times more ...  so, i got SKUNKed by buying it ...  Am I the only weirdo who does the test? Coz' I have not seen such a report anywhere yet ..  Cheers ................. I got SKUNKED by ""Leader material"" ................................."

135609,Raf,2007-11-21 19:52:00,3495,what about abrasian resistance??
135610,solopaddler,2007-11-21 19:54:00,8605,"I've used the Maxima perfection as tippet steelhead fishing and have found it to be NO WHERE near as durable or strong as Maxima Ultragreen. No comparison really...  As far as the other line goes, are you sure you don't mean Stren ""Magnathin""? I could quite easily be wrong, but I've never heard of Stren Megathin...  Anyhow, as far as the Magnathin goes, when I'm finesse fishing with light spinning tackle, 8lb Moss Green Magnathin is by far my favourite line, (if I can find it). Virtually no memory and quite durable..."
135612,Terry,2007-11-21 19:58:00,14456,"Raf, totally posted the important question   and if I am going for a line record,,I want it to break at the lb stated on the box...... seems like an unnecessary study to me"
135631,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 20:45:00,7971,"Not sure if this matters either, but does the temperature of the line at the time of testing make a difference?  Most of my stream fishing is in waters that are pretty cold....most would think that the colder something is the more brittle it could become?  Does the different manufacturing of these lines affect this?  It would be cool if this could be tested with more brands of line too.  You've done great work!  More than most of us could accomplish.  Hopefully some of these suggestions can make it into your next study."
135669,Spiel,2007-11-21 22:03:00,9065,....Been using Maxima Ultragreen on my float reel for years and the same stuff (lighter test) for leaders. Guess I somehow knew it was the right choice.
