134678,Mike the Pike,2007-11-19 15:39:00,3421,"The time finally came to drive down the 401 and leave the worst roads in Canada behind.  GlennK and I arrived wednesday night just after a good quantity of rainfall.As we walked in our Cabin we got to meet the Greencoachdog who I had long been waiting to meet.Percher took Glen out on the water on wednesday and Dan has a nice fish to report.  It was great to finally meet some new faces Like ,Greencoachdog,Vatordude,Kyle,Gerritt,Corey,BitsmithB2K(The really tall guy)Oldphart.Ted the Gadget,Slowpoke(who looks younger in person  )Big Chev 4X4,Bill Parker, Bassmastermike,Lexington and Bly(Carole)and CCMT Canada(Cliff).And Many more  I did have the pleasure of fishing from the docs in Picton at night with Carole ,Cliff,Lexxington and GlennK which I really enjoyed and learned a few pointers from Carole about shore fishing.I also got to see what Quinte Shad look like which I had never seen fat little minnows for sure.  Tried to get Dog out on Friday to show me the Sabiki rig thing but it was too darn cold for the dog there is always next time Glen.  Although many caught some nice fish and some who caught PB's the fishing was on the slow side after 4 days of fishing my Buddy GleenK boated a fish it  was his PB.Pics to come later.  A word of thanks to Gerritt who worked very hard with me to organize the Potluck dinner and most of all finding a place for some to bunk with others and most of all making sure no one got left on shore and I don't think anyone stayed on shore.Wayne had as much as 4 people in his boat and so did Oldphart who shared his boat with Slug,Kyle and Vatordude(Jeff)  I know Brian(slowpoke)has a nice fish to show us and looking forward to his report.  Congradulations to Chuck(Big Chev 4X4) the winner of our first ever OFC Walleye tournamaent and congrats to Lady walleye with her PB of almost 8lbs  And to Kevin with I beleive second place was it bigger than slowpokes?  A special thanks to DouG,Vatordude, and Bill Parker for helping me clean  up and set up the potluck dinner.  Now on with the pics.   This is how you dress with a tiller boat in November now those goggles made my eyes comfortable out there   My fishing partner GlennK.   This is a shot of Kenny and DouG out on Thursday Morning.   Can you believe it Percher,Biteme and Pointed let me hang my yellow survival suit beside theirs.I am honoured guys.   Chuck ,Greencoachdog,Tybo and Kenny's friend Blair.   Now I know halloween is over but this guy made his scary appearance.The one and only Greencoachdog!!!!!!!!   Joey,DouG,Irishfield,Dano,and Bassmastermike.   Yes it was cold at times so GlennK covered up very well.   Percher,Biteme and Pointed on Thursday before Peter 's little incident on Friday you will have to ask Biteme what that was     These shots are for you Brian shall we make this a tradition on G2G Tybo did leave us a Molson Canadian to throw in.     I had the pleasure of fishing with this gentleman Cliff .I really enjoyed your company out there it was a great time and the water was so calm despite having to fix my trolling plate in the dark.      After washing all those lures for such a long time GlennK hooks into the only fish that came aboard my boat for the entire weekend a new PB for Glenn 6lbs 4oz.finally I have to tell you I put him on that fish and I did a great job netting it to.So what if I got skunked.   Now this was the potluck dinner a shot of Ted the Gadget.Before that Peter(Biteme)says man this is a FOOD ORGASM.Unbelievable amount of food.Once again the OFC members made our Potluck dinner a succes thanks to all who cooked or had there wives whip us up some grub.   Carole enjoying  the huge selection.those are the Cabbage rolls that vatordude brought   A shot of my contribution with GlennK and Percher's stew which was also awesome.   Sunday came and I had lost a spring from my trolling plate which would have been a quick fix but would have wasted valuable fishing time trying to find a spring in town.Kenny's partner went home so the three of us fished in his boat sunday morning and they constantly reminded me that I was the only one who did not catch a fish this weekend   kenny and me the one with the Skunk.     One last pic for the road leaving the bay.  Despite my skunking I had a great time with our OFC members I look forward to out next event.  Mike the Pike"
