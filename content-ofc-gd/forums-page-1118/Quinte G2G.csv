134815,PERCHER,2007-11-20 00:05:00,787,Well I arrived at Merlands around 9am in search of the dog.After looking around and a few phone calls later I decided to have a look around.  After a little while the phone rang and with the help of a few OFNERS I found Glen. After about 10 minutes of chatting it was time to wet a line.   It was slow fishing but it paid off in the long run.The first rod went off but it was a very short battle. then about 20 minutes later this guy took the bait.    And that was it for are walleye. the rest are a few shots of the rest of the weekend.    after a hard day fishing it was time to relax.     It was a great weekend meeting new faces and some old faces.It was nice to talk with slowpoke and finding out that we both had lived in the same area and new all the same people.It was also nice to finaly meet Cliff and Carole and Fishing devil and all the other great people from OFC. So thanks guys and girls for making it a great weekend. And a special thanks to my new Bamy buddy GCD. Glen you were a great fishing partner and enjoyed every minute we were in the boat. I hope you had a good ride home and hope to see you in the future.   Dan

134833,Greencoachdog,2007-11-20 00:58:00,8163,"It was great to meet, and fish with you Dan! I learned a lot about planer boards and downriggers while in your boat. I also appreciate the loan of the float suit, gotta get one of those. Even though the fishin' was slow it was still great fun fishin' in your boat!... Yer a Class Act Bubba!  I'll post pics of that fish with the rightful owner as soon as I get them loaded."
134948,Rich Clemens,2007-11-20 10:40:00,3131,None of us can recognize Dog in any of those pictures.    Should have made him stand up and take his shirt off for the pics.
