Every year we'd get together to watch that one game and he'd always take the western team and I'd take whoever was playing for the east and we'd put $20 on the game.  I couldn't have ever cared less who won the game or even the $20 but it was always a blast watching that game together with him, and even now that Dad's been gone 10 years, those Grey Cup games always bring back fabulous memories.  Just thinking about it now makes me smile   .....thanks for the memories Holdfast"
