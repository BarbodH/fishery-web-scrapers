135739,TennesseeGuy,2007-11-22 00:09:00,957,"No winner so far.  Gotta beat 73 years, 3 months and 28 days."
135745,Beans,2007-11-22 00:20:00,3339,1st August 1987 (20 years)...15 years after I gave up booze !!!  Player's Mild was my brand...  If I won...send the beer to Misfish...(I owe him one for some wizzles he sent me)...   Cripes !!!...you are even older than Nanook !
135757,John Bacon,2007-11-22 00:53:00,3277,"41 years, 2 months, and six days.  Add nine months or so if I am allowed to start counting from conception.  Carlsberg will do fine."
135843,kennyman,2007-11-22 04:18:00,737,"I can't win this one but I've been clean for over a year and a half. I think a year and eight months actually.There are times when I can still feel the craving. If you're going to work, grab a coffee and roll down the window ...... here comes the rush. I've even grabbed for the darn things a few times. It's getting easier all the time, but I still have weak moments. I'm not giving in though. They say it's harder to quit than heroin ........................... I can believe it."
135848,keram,2007-11-22 04:33:00,585,"  About an hr, but it was downhill    Heineken is fine"
135627,TennesseeGuy,2007-11-21 20:39:00,957,To anyone who has gone longer than I have without smoking a cigarette.  Let's hear from you.  List your brand.
135629,jedimaster,2007-11-21 20:42:00,3472,Nine years - Used to smoke Green Death.
135630,misfish,2007-11-21 20:44:00,29133,Now thats just not fair.I enjoy a good beer and a smoke together.How do you guys do it???????????  Nice offering though.
135633,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 20:47:00,7971,Since 2 oclock this afternoon...just before my last meeting.  Do I win?
135634,jedimaster,2007-11-21 20:49:00,3472,I was at a friends house drinking and slept over on the couch. When I woke up my friends cat was sleeping on me and I could hardly breathe from my cat allergies. I lit up a cigarette out of reflex and nearly threw up. That was the last time I light up. No cigs' colts or cigars.  Nothing like what feels like a near death experience to make your quit something.  I never really went through any withdrawls or anything. My mind just told me enough was enough and that was it for me. Never really even wanted to smoke again. Not even tempted to have a puf here or there. I think I smoked the strongest possble ones too in the green death's.
135635,misfish,2007-11-21 20:53:00,29133,"I do have to admit,I dont light up til I get home. I do have the odd smoke at work,but only when Im stressed and I can bum one.LOL Some wonder why I cant quit,hell I wonder why I cant."
135636,snag,2007-11-21 20:55:00,1932," Exports,  I presume?"
135637,Garyv,2007-11-21 20:55:00,547,Cigarette....haven't has one since July 1978 and I used to smoke 50 to 70 of Craven menthols  ( or Salem's in the States ) a day.  If I win donate the case of beer to a VFW or old folks home that's having a Christmas party because I haven' t had a beer for over 30 years.
135638,jedimaster,2007-11-21 20:56:00,3472,You have to want to. If you don't want to quit you won't..and just because you want to quit doesn't mean you will be able to quit. Mind over matter and matter over mind.
135639,jedimaster,2007-11-21 20:57:00,3472, Yah Export A Green. Do they even sell them still? Same ugly green color package?
135640,irishfield,2007-11-21 21:00:00,26272,That's not fair Connie.... I'm nots as olds as you!  That said.. I haven't smoked a CIGARETTE in 45 years & 8 Months....as of tomorrow! lol
135645,Whopper,2007-11-21 21:05:00,2174,"First thing is I'm surprised to hear you ever smoked TG. Chesterfields? Not going to win this bet but I quit smoking cigarettes over fours years ago, quit once for seven years but had a two year relapse. Marboros were my choice.  edit I have to come clean, I'm not smoke free because I do indulge in cigars. Don't I already owe you a case of beer?"
135649,TennesseeGuy,2007-11-21 21:10:00,957,"No winners so far.  I meant list the brand of beer you'll accept for winning.  Wayne, are you sure?  I guess your picture makes you appear older.   Was thinking we're about the same age, give or take a year or so."
135651,TJQ,2007-11-21 21:11:00,7806, I smoked a Rothman's behind the benches at the local arena with my cousin when I was 12.. I haven't had one since....  that's 30 Years...  I drink Carling.....
135653,lew,2007-11-21 21:12:00,12767,"Export ""A"" smokes for me also, and like so many others, I told myself for 30 years how much I enjoyed smoking them ....... ya right........ but it's been 16 years since I had one and have never given them a second thought.  Used to drink Export beer too, but it been about 14 years since I packed that stuff in also, and like the smokes, I didn't miss the beer either, so if my name is drawn TG, you can give my beer to the same vet that GaryV is giving his to.  Somehow though, I've got a feelin  that your gonna tell us you NEVER smoked the filthy things so it's gonna be pretty tough to beat ya"
135656,kemper,2007-11-21 21:19:00,2232,17 years and 231 days.  but  im only 17 years and 231 days old.  which is apparently not old enough to accept the prize...
135657,jedimaster,2007-11-21 21:23:00,3472,"hehe I was just thinking the same thing, either him or someone else is gonna say I am 50 years old and never smoked a cig in my life.  lol Dito to my case of beer, although I woul dlove to drink it, I am ok with buying my own, take my case to a local legion or firehall."
135660,TJQ,2007-11-21 21:32:00,7806,"Ill be at the Legion beside the Firehall, next to the police station and the old nurses home....."
135662,lew,2007-11-21 21:35:00,12767,That covers most of the angles TJ
135664,TJQ,2007-11-21 21:41:00,7806," If someone else is buying, you can be sure ill be in close proximity..... lol... its been a long day...."
135665,Greencoachdog,2007-11-21 21:52:00,8163,That beer is mine!!!... if you haven't smoked one in the past 5 minutes!!!!
135667,Whopper,2007-11-21 21:57:00,2174, Ouch
135678,Rich Clemens,2007-11-21 22:16:00,3131,"27 years ago was my last.  Smoked while I was in college.  Once I got married and had a child, the last pack of cigs went into the garbage can and never picked one up since."
135691,Greencoachdog,2007-11-21 23:09:00,8163, LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
