135469,Spiel,2007-11-21 13:47:00,9065,"....Well I finally broke down and bought a snow blower (health issues necessitated it). I purchesed this one yesterday. The price at $999.99 was offset by my having saved $305.00 in CTC funny money and a scratch and save event that netted me another $100.00 in CTC money refunded. I know many of you could or would rather wait for the white stuff but me, I'm looking forward to using my new machine."
135471,irishfield,2007-11-21 13:49:00,26272,Good deal Bud! And also great to hear we won't be gettin any snow in Hamilton this year...since yuz is prepared and all !
135472,Spiel,2007-11-21 13:51:00,9065, ....I could live with that Wayne. Then everyone in the area would be thanking me.
135473,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 13:53:00,7971,"That's a great deal!  Have fun with the thing....and if you're ever in my neck of the woods, feel free to clear my driveway whenever you want.  Free hot coffee inside when you're done....hehe."
135477,lew,2007-11-21 14:00:00,12767,"Nice machine Spiel and I think your timing was perfect, were sposed to get a bunch of that ugly white stuff tonight  My winter tires are going on the truck today."
135485,JohnF,2007-11-21 14:19:00,3494," I don't think you'll regret your choice. I bought it's bigger brother a few years ago when my 25 year old Ariens calved on me. I used it for two winters then gave it to my son last winter as he had a much bigger drive to clear and the damned thing used up too much garage space. I then went out and bought it's baby brother, a better size for my garage and my drive size.  One suggestion in case you haven't already thought of it - while it's still squeaky clean get some industrial silicone spray and cover the inside of the bucket and the chute plus the auger and impeller. It helps keep snow from jamming up inside, especially in the chute. Dry snow's no problem, but the wet heavy stuff is a pita.  JF"
135521,douG,2007-11-21 15:53:00,2693,$305 in CTC money?  Wow.  The cashier must have been ecstatic to get all that stuff back in the till.
135568,Spiel,2007-11-21 17:55:00,9065,"  Thanks John a great idea and no I hadn't thought of it.   Coffee! Ah you will be putting Baileys in it, right?   I had it all sorted and stacked in bundles of $50 Doug but still she counted every bill. I'm just grateful no one was waiting in line behind me."
135572,Tybo,2007-11-21 18:02:00,1373,WOW HO. Spiel going to keep the launch open?
135577,Spiel,2007-11-21 18:12:00,9065, Sure thing Paul but we haul it in the back of your truck!
135648,mattyk,2007-11-21 21:08:00,2110,my father has a honda snow blower and he loves it. It would have been nice to have one around as a kid when i had to clear the drive way all those times.
135658,motv8tr,2007-11-21 21:27:00,2587,"Looks good Chris, I'm buying one tomorrow, it's a toss up between an Ariens 6 HP and an MTD pro 8HP...decisions decisions  Maureen"
135659,jedimaster,2007-11-21 21:27:00,3472,Most I had was about 150 bucks they called another person over to help count it. And I didn't even have a single $1 or $2 bill.
135736,Fisherman,2007-11-22 00:03:00,7201,"Do yourself a favour Maureen, get an Ariens, it's quality, mines almost 40 years old and still working fine.  You missed the sale last friday night at Home Depot, 15% off list, my son bought one for $930, tax in."
