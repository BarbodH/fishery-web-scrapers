135499,fishindevil,2007-11-21 15:02:00,6254,"WSell as usual....Hmmmmm ...i bought another $ 1000- $2000, worth of new lures,  man you can just never have enough,i try to explain that to my GF,but she doesnt understand,  its like an addiction isnt it.??????and it never ends isnt it unreal how much money fishermen spend on fishing equipment & gear??????   well i know how much i spend everyear and thats probly why i have never owned a house,cause at an early age i wanted fishing,gear instead,and its never stopped...LOL..LOL..LOL.....cheers"
135551,mattyk,2007-11-21 17:12:00,2110,"I picked up a lot of new muskie stuff, especially from ebay. I picked up Frabill muskie net that I really like and some Knipex cutters. I picked up bunch of bucktails and spinner baits for a really good deal. I got a St Croix MH primer 7'6 muskie rod and a calcutta 400 real, 7'6 XH shimano compre with a 6500 Abu c3. I have really liked everything so far. The best lure that i picked up this year was a few super believers, and I really love their action. For my birthday i also got a double D, bulldawg, manta, and suick. Hoping to catch a fish on them next year.   "
135712,glen,2007-11-21 23:30:00,2641,I got a new Honda outboard and its perfect.  I got alot of other good stuff and i am still waiting for some muskie stuff from cabela's.
135717,Muskieman,2007-11-21 23:42:00,2472,"I found this cool lure called ..get this ..""The Banjo Minnow"".....  I actually bought a Rocket Fishin Rod for my 3 year old and she loves it , she was taking pot-shots at passer-by beavers  with it  and actually reeled a fair amount of panfish and a Walleye.  I graduated my 10yr old to a spincast..  I have all the equipment I'll ever need.. bout the only time I buy stuff is when I lose something Believe me  I lose alot of lures... so far this year I'm probably looking at 400.00$ worth of lures alone.. not counting the line and stuff that I'll never use..  Best lure I've bought this year ... I a refill of 4"" white Berkley Gulp twister tails and a whole whack of short shank Fireball Jigs assorted colors... Mostly chartreuse and orange.  #2 Blackfly Tackle  1.0 oz spinnerbaits   great $$ tough as nails and catch fish."
135806,mistaredone,2007-11-22 02:36:00,913,"Favorite new lure...  9"" Zar Spook.  Not just a tone of fun to watch dance but the crazyest top water hits I have ever seen.  Worst buy is tied between Gorilla Tough braid ( rope ) and the fifty dollar shopping spree on Storm soft body lures which only made for good bath tub vids."
135241,Canuck2fan,2007-11-21 00:21:00,1444,I bought a couple of rods that I really like  Bass Pro Wally Marshal Crappie pro 8ft really good deal when it was on special for 29.95 U.S. and would have spent double on it. Excellent for pan fish and on my last bass excursion this year I landed a 2.4lb smallie and one over 4lbs no problem.  11.5 ft Swan Noodle Rod Company Black haven't taken it out of the wrapper yet but used a friends and can't wait till I need to use this one.  Got a pair of Redhead Neoprene waders and so far have really enjoyed using them. Can't wait till it gets a little colder to see how warm they really are.  But the BEST fishing equipment I bought for sure enjoyment though was a shimano convergence 10fter and a Pflueger 6740 President for my dad to steelhead with. Seeing him nail his first rainbow in about 15yrs with that combo was priceless!!!!
135258,sonny,2007-11-21 01:02:00,511,To much stuff to list!!!!  But the biggest purchase would be my humminbird 797si
135261,danc,2007-11-21 01:12:00,4677,"I bought some new line. Cabelas 6 lb. mono pro line, a few new Rapala Countdowns and a dozen or so jig flies (a local thing). Pretty much the same stuff I buy every year. About $75.00 worth total."
135263,tdotfisherman,2007-11-21 01:13:00,317,"Well letâ€™s see... this was my first year of buying my own equipment. In the past, I had only gone fishing up at other people's cottages, and usually just borrowed their rods, and used their tackle. This year I decided it was long overdue to go out and buy my own stuff.. now on to the list..  I bought 4 rods, 6'6"" abu garcia, 8'8"" shimano, 7' zebco and another 6' zebco for my spare reel.. I got an abu garcia specialist spinning reel, a shimano spinning reel, and a zebco spinning reel..  I laid out for a nice plano tackle box, fishing gloves, net, plyers, scale, file, etc.. and over the course of the year I bought assorted tackle.. everything you can think of.. spoons, spinnerbaits, jerkbaits, crankbaits, plastics, topwater, jigs.. the list goes on..  All this fishing stuff put me back a bit (poor university student), but 2008 is really going to have some lavish purchases.. just need to save up some coin.. hopefully my woman won't be offended by the golden arches.."
135266,Crazyhook,2007-11-21 01:15:00,1154,nought a weighed musky lure made out of wood. Some fine fisherman kept pushing them on me and I am glad he did.. a 30 pounder was boated and the rest is history!

135294,pikeie,2007-11-21 01:54:00,380,"6'6"" shimano compre- great rod i found, ive only used it for walleye so far and it is super sensitive  7'0 shimano crucial- by far my fav spining rod, used it plenty of times for those giant simcoe bass, some hawg river walleyes, i even got a 6.75 lbs largie on it fishin smallies.  7'6"" fenwick hmg flippin stick- great rod for largies in the thick stuff  shimano symetrye (sp??) 2500- paired it up with the new compre  abu garcia 802 spinning reel- was a good reel untill the anit reverse went on it after a few months lol.  john spahr float reel- picked up this little beauty at simcoe bait and tackle from little john himself lol, has been great and is my first float reel, i would recomend this reel to anyone!  BARE cutthrought waders great waders  TONS of lures (to many to name) its been an expensive year lol"
135296,Garyv,2007-11-21 01:59:00,547,"Mmmm lets see.  After selling my Starcraft Salmon boat I spent some dollars on a Eagle 502I GPS bought the navionics great lakes card.  Purchased a new Unidin VHF radio, bought 2 new bass/walleye rods a St Croix Avid and a G Loomis and picked up a used 70 hp Evinrude to replace the 30 Evinrude on my boat.  Trouble with all this was/is I was to sick all summer to try any of the stuff so next year I won't have to spend any money on anything.  Oh one other thing I had a custom Bimini top made for the boat for those hot sunny days."
135308,Dondorfish,2007-11-21 02:30:00,1000,Canon Mag 10 electric riggers with telescopic booms ( pair ) - awsome!   Don
135312,Gerritt,2007-11-21 02:35:00,6129,"well if were talking specifics... I also purchased a Stradic, 2 daiwa sealines, a Quantum PT, 2 Shimano TDR's just about every variety of Reef Runner made, and a crap load of mann's Stretch 20's.. 4 Salty's, 4 grippers, 2 anchor cleats etc... the list goes on and on... Including a New boat, trailer and motor...  I spent almost 700.00 just for the Quinte trip alone!... my payback for all that $$ a 3-4lb Walter...   Go figure..  That fish was worth about 175.00 per pound I figure... but he went back to be caught another day by a fisherman that spent even more...   again a great thread and look forward to it every year.  G."
135317,Terry,2007-11-21 02:40:00,14456,I can't  put my list  my wife might read it and kill me but they are all good
135323,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-21 02:44:00,1351," lol, terry you're too funny!"
135333,Hooked,2007-11-21 02:54:00,891,"Didn't pickup too much this year, but I like what I did get.  Start off with this Daiwa Tierra 2500 spinning reel, awesome:    Landed 5 salmon this fall, drag handled like a champ!  and a Shimano Clarus 7' spinning rod, really like it.  Also tried Spiderwire Stealth line, my new favourite super line and some P-line Evolution copolymer line, also very good line."
135377,Raf,2007-11-21 03:56:00,3495,"this was a slow year for new gear, I guess I just have what I need.  having said that, I got a pair of okuma convectors (30dlx and 20dlx - lefty linecounters) last xmas, both performed well. the smaller size caught a lot of trout in the spring.  a new-to-me frabill net got slimed.  knipex cutters came in handy a few times making hook-cutting a breeze.  i found the daiwa regal xi (?) to be a great value for spinning reels (got a 2000 and 750 size).  lure-wise, the winners were homemade baits.  diplip tied up a couple of monster 15""+ double blade colorado 10 boos that are just awesome in the water and a reel workout to throw.. they've been bit.   i also got a custom 'hose' trolling bait that is just awesome.  overall however, i've found myself simplifying and going back to the handful of lures that consistently produce - that means i still haven't caught a fish on those danged bulldawgs and the red october tubes i got at the odyssey hardly saw the water."
135470,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 13:48:00,7971,"When this year began, I had literally a few cheap spinning combos.  This year marked my first full year of fishing, so even though we didn't spend a TON of money, I did my fair share of shopping....  Fishing Rods - 12.5' Shimano Convergence for hunting steelhead - 7 foot medium/heavy Shimano Sojourn for shore salmon fishing - I got this Shimano trolling rod with an Okuma reel for my birthday.   Boat Stuff You may recall that Basskicker gave us this sweet canoe!   So I went out and bought this stuff because well...I'm lazy...LOL     In October, we purchased our first fishing boat...a 14 foot tinny with 18hp Merc.   That about covers it for major purchases....next year will be an expensive year though...getting our boat all decked out to our liking....  All the stuff has worked out great!  I broke the Sojourn in the car door...so cant blame them for that one.  New one is on it's way though."
135475,lew,2007-11-21 13:55:00,12767," You'll like those Double D's Mike, their an excellent twitch bait and will definetely put a few extra muskies in your boat next year."
