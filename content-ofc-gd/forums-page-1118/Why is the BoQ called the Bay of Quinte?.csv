Since the French were the first Europeans to have contact with that First Nation, they spelled it Quint√©.  Here is some early history of the area, and here is the phonetic history of the name.  Just in case you were wondering."

135338,John Bacon,2007-11-21 02:58:00,3277," Gee, I have never heard of anyone referring to a chain or grass pickerel as walleye... is that a new trend???"
135341,Grimace,2007-11-21 03:03:00,2020,Wiki says that Belleville made a fortune hustling booze during Prohibition.   Now THATS good Canadian history!!!!
135385,douG,2007-11-21 04:14:00,2693,"LeXX, that question was what started the research, that and Lake On the Mountain.  I've learned that LotM has the same water level, hour by hour, as Lake Erie.  As for the Reach, it was formed from a combination of glacial push to form Sandbanks, tectonic rebound after the glaciers retreated, and some tectonic movement not associated with the other two.  I really have no idea."
135387,BLACKFISH88,2007-11-21 04:24:00,191,canada is called canada because I believe what my history teacher told me it was a mistake. The natives took early settlers down the river which I believe was somewhere in Quebec and the natives called it kanata which I believe the river is still there so the early settlers proclaimed the land Canada. Just what I remember from school unsure if it is a fact.
