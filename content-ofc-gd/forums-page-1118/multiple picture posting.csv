135138,DANIMAL,2007-11-20 20:42:00,215, How do I post multiple pictures without making them really small like this one?
135139,ccmtcanada,2007-11-20 20:44:00,7971,"Danimal....  Open an account at www.photobucket.com  Upload your pictures there.  Copy the image location and paste it right in your report...that way you can post as many images as you want and they wont be that small.  If you have any more questions, just let me know!  Good luck."
135151,DANIMAL,2007-11-20 21:27:00,215,Thanks ccmtcanada I'll try that out and hopefully have a report soon.
135206,DANIMAL,2007-11-20 23:19:00,215,I tried that out and something went wrong. Take a look at my report (Grey bruce bass report)
135214,bobkayla,2007-11-20 23:34:00,148,hit the code that says message boards and that should fix you up..
135235,Mike the Pike,2007-11-21 00:05:00,3421,Dan when your in photobucket copy where it says direct link.Then go back to your post on OFC Clic insert image the box with the sun and tree then right clic paste in the rectangle and clik ok this will allow the pic in your post to appear full size.Remember you will need to scale down your photos from a softare that can shrink the image before going to photobucket.Good luck .Mike
135236,Roy,2007-11-21 00:08:00,13728,I still don't understand why you guys don't just post directly from your desktops.
135244,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 00:30:00,7971, Because us peons on the board only get 250k to attach...which means only 2 or 3 pics before it says we've run out of attachment space.  You guys get unlimited....LOL.
135247,Roy,2007-11-21 00:35:00,13728,"OOPS, sorry Cliff. This came up before but I'd forgotten about it."
135252,DANIMAL,2007-11-21 00:44:00,215,"Thanks guys, I'm just learning all this computer stuff."
