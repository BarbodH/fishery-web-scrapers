134868,stasbrute,2007-11-20 01:59:00,206,"Hey, anyone know what would be best to repair the cork on my rod, closed it in the door OOPS!!!!! "
134875,urbanangler1990,2007-11-20 02:28:00,933,"resin and that other paste u add, cant remeber exactly though"
134877,outdoorguy61,2007-11-20 02:29:00,220,"This looks repairable. Sanding with a plug and glue to seal in a nutshell should catch it. Aikmans in Mississauga should be able to do this if you do not have access to someone that works with rods.  Oh...and you can also make your cork clean again (it looks filthy....lol) by a wiping it down with a bit of bleach diluted in warm water. Afterwards, wash it down it clear water.  outdoorguy61"
134930,HTHM,2007-11-20 05:27:00,4082,"there is a two part glue that I use for trim, I'm a carpenter, called miter bond. I think that will fix it. PM your addy and I can meet up with you to do the repair. It'll cost ya a timmy's."
134951,Spiel,2007-11-20 10:46:00,9065,"....LePages two part epoxy will work (not the 5 min variety), use masking tape to secure while it dries."
135076,1Harringtona,2007-11-20 17:21:00,77,Superglue LOL
135183,addict,2007-11-20 22:41:00,475,bubblegum or duct tape .or maybe j.b weld this stuff will fix just about anything
135197,Gerritt,2007-11-20 22:58:00,6129,can you just not replace the cork in its entirety?  G
135313,stasbrute,2007-11-21 02:36:00,206,I'm leaning towards the epoxy I hope it works out its my fav. rod thanks for the replies
135318,irishfield,2007-11-21 02:41:00,26272,"""Leaning"".... I think I'd take the ""typing"" of a rod builder, especially Spiel, verbatim if I was you."
135332,stasbrute,2007-11-21 02:51:00,206,yes. yes epoxy it is....how foolish of me....
135334,irishfield,2007-11-21 02:54:00,26272,
135427,Spiel,2007-11-21 11:10:00,9065,"  ....Verbatim....lol. Well there are other types of glue that would or could work but IMO epoxy is the best because it is for the most part, permanent!  Thanks Wayne."
135839,Dabluz,2007-11-22 04:09:00,701,"Don't forget to insert a small piece from an old broken rod before gluing the end of the handle back on with epoxy.  Every time I come across a piece of rod or a broken rod, I keep it in order to salvage parts when friends come to me with their broken rods to be repaired.  When I have enough broken rods, I make some short ice fishing rods for fishing trout, pike and even saltwater fish like cod and halibut in up to 600 feet of water."
135841,outdoorguy61,2007-11-22 04:16:00,220,"If using 2 part epoxy, it is very important that both surfaces be clean and a nice fit is secured. This fit should somehow be compressed to make it perform and last better. Just a tidbit.  outdoorguy61"
