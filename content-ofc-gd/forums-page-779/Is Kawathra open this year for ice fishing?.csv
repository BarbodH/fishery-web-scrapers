390509,CRAPPIE,2009-10-06 01:29:00,213,"There is a thread talking about the Ministry allow ice fishing in the Kawathra Lake this year, Is this true?"
390512,jediangler,2009-10-06 01:44:00,1923,"Nope. Not that I've heard anyways. Of course Scugog after Jan. 1st, but that's it."
390577,Stoty,2009-10-06 10:37:00,2910,If they do...say bye bye to our fishery! Stupidest move ever!!
390602,mbac31,2009-10-06 12:30:00,904,"Wasnt there a posting about opening it in 2010 for ice fishing. Panfish only I beleive. Hope they do, especially to tone down some of the panfish populations. I have been gtting crappie/Bluegill everywhere in the Kararthas this season. Very large ones as well."
390662,jediangler,2009-10-06 16:53:00,1923,You can fish panfish in the Kawarthas in April and May if you want to try and lessen their numbers.
390670,ciceri,2009-10-06 18:21:00,535,I wouldn't mind that at all.. Last time we were at Balsam we were saying how good ice fishing would be there.
390760,Stoty,2009-10-06 23:35:00,2910,"You know that people would be harvesting Walleye/Bass etc. Most people follow the rules, but a lot of people don't as well.  Stupid move if you ask me."
390764,pikeie,2009-10-06 23:41:00,380, I totally agree... there are enuff lakes in close proximity that are open in the winter... Keep'em closed!
390768,crappieperchhunter,2009-10-06 23:46:00,2582,I have mixed feelings about the Kawartha's being open for the hard water. I plan on retiring to Bobcaygeon so it would be nice to fish closer to home in the winter.  However I have the same concerns as Stoty about the fishery going to hell.  I think a good compromise would be to open it for pannies and walleye for a short season like Scugog...but really monitor it. If the fishery starts to go south then close it up again.  It would be fantastic if it was sustainable.....and it would be good for local businesses to get a little more tourist $$$$ during the winter.
390795,Ron,2009-10-07 01:10:00,1683,"Well if people are going to harvest fish out of season (poaching), I guess we might better close all seasons of all species to coincide with Bass opener and then close them on November 15th.  Cause everyone knows, guys keep walleye, bass, muskie and pike starting on the 4th Saturday in April."
390797,irishfield,2009-10-07 01:12:00,26272,Tell us how your really feel my friend! lol
390799,Terry,2009-10-07 01:13:00,14456,I thought I read some sarcasm in his post
