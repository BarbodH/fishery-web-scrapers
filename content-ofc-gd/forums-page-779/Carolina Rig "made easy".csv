390458,splashhopper,2009-10-06 00:05:00,2931,I like this guys SHORT simple and clear video presentations of knots and rigs:  Carolina Rig>> 
390462,Greencoachdog,2009-10-06 00:11:00,8163,"Forget the Carolina rig!!!... yer a ""Top water Dude""!!!... remember?  Seriously though, I find I get a lot of ""deep hooked"" fish on the Carolina rig, it's hard to detect the bite... and most of the time they've already inhaled the lure!  It is a very effective presentation for plastic worms and lizards!"
390466,splashhopper,2009-10-06 00:15:00,2931,I also think this other rig may be an effective set up in some of the trout waters I will be fishing shortly  sacrificial 3-way rig >>
