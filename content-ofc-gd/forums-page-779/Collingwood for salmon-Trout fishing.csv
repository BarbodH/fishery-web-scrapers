390284,juan96,2009-10-05 14:16:00,23,Hi  I'll visit Collingwood next week but didn't tried fishing there yet.  Any information is welcome for Salmon or Trout fishing...  Notawasaga river is good for Trout or Salmon?
390439,xkempx,2009-10-05 22:43:00,84,"good luck with your trip. The Natta.. is good for Salmon, And Pine river to."
390442,Rustic-Fisher,2009-10-05 22:56:00,826,"Remember ""The Pine"" is closed.  Notty will have plenty"
390445,trout-eater,2009-10-05 23:02:00,21,"isn't the notty the holding place of the Ontario steelhead record???   my guess if yes, then it should be good."
390485,xkempx,2009-10-06 00:49:00,84," Oh yes, dont go to the Pine. Go to Notty saga."
390487,StoneFly,2009-10-06 00:50:00,574,"check your reg's for the closed areas as well as Catch and release only for Steelhead.  not many Salmon left in that Fishery, Steelhead are still ok, but its a little early and unless you know your stuff, the Lower notty may prove a formitable challenge.  If you are a Newb, try somewhere like Erindale Park on the Credit in mississauga, you can learn alot from the right people, pay no attention to the goons snagging,....unless of course you want to report them."
390610,juan96,2009-10-06 12:56:00,23,"Thanks for reply but..  I'm not newb and I tried few years for salmon and trout..  Anybody can link Google map for exact place , e.g. where I have to park my car and where I have to down .. the river is not short.. too long.. and I have no idea where I have heading..."
390654,BillM,2009-10-06 16:06:00,17367,I don't think anyone is going to give you exact spots on the Notty to fish.   My only suggestion would be to head down to McDonalds in Wasaga Beach and go from there.
