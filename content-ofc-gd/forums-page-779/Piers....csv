We've been at Bronte and Hamilton Harbour for like 8+ hrs every day since Wednesday and haven't even seen a fish jump.  I did however see one dead in the water, filleted.. heh...  Anyone else having such bad luck?"
390388,highdrifter,2009-10-05 19:19:00,2534,Urge to spawn...  RISING!!
390403,frozen-fire,2009-10-05 20:00:00,542,They're in the rivers bud! Look at all the rain we got. That's what all the fish were waiting for.
390407,tdotfisherman,2009-10-05 20:14:00,317,I gave up pier/boat fishing for Salmon 3 weeks ago...
390408,Fang,2009-10-05 20:16:00,1330,rain spurred on the fish that were in tight. The next batch are still lounging out offshore as warmer water is still kicking around. I was out a couple weeks ago and all the way from 120 FOW to 280 I had 65F down to 80 feet deep. Was on the pier last night and noticed a ton of river washout in the water. No sign of any salmon surfacing in the harbour or off the breakwall. Water temp in the river was still 63F. Talked to one gent who had been out on the weekend and was still picking up salmon and rainbows in 250 FOW. We need some cold nights of a good north wind for a week

390470,[email protected],2009-10-06 00:29:00,290, No Way!  I'm going tonight at like 3am. I am determined to land one.  Gonna try there and Bronte Pier.
390498,danjang,2009-10-06 01:08:00,148,"I went to the ganny, humber and the credit mouths on the weekend. Very few fish, almost no salmon and only a few trout. I'm thinking pier and mouth fishing is pretty much done for those rivers. The other fisherpeople I've talked to agree."
390500,Greencoachdog,2009-10-06 01:12:00,8163,"  Yup!... it's the full moon!   ... if they're not biting in the middle of the night, they aint biting!!!"
390528,CLofchik,2009-10-06 02:21:00,854," Sowry again Dawg, but the full moon is bad for the salmon bite. It's been too bright & calm off Bronte & Burlington, the darker & stormier the better the pier fishing.  The next night there's a 20knot breeze will be good in your usual spot Utyma.  Then again there's always some fish around, was one of two caught off a local spot.  "
390637,[email protected],2009-10-06 14:28:00,290,I ended up falling asleep and waking up right now. So I guess I missed it last night lol.  Pretty sure I'll be there tonight though!
390689,johnnyb,2009-10-06 19:43:00,3413,"LMAO!!!  When you're determined to go, but still fall asleep, you know you need the rest   I'm gonna take the seasoned vet's advice, and wait for the wind to blow the right way...that pier has beaten my spirits down too much to go back just yet"
390693,fishinguypat,2009-10-06 20:00:00,547,   compared to your foot that thing looks small hehe
390803,[email protected],2009-10-07 01:19:00,290,I went today from about 5pm till the storm came in and didn't get a single bite.  I did however see a nice one jump like 200 yards out...  I wonder if the rain has subsided.. I'm tempted to go back.. or to Bronte..
390810,CLofchik,2009-10-07 01:31:00,854,"Might hit up the pier when the rain stops (I'm so sweet I'm made outta sugar dontcha know  ). There's a couple spots I might check out too (pssst, the Lift Bridge is just their first stop)"
390812,[email protected],2009-10-07 01:34:00,290, Its stopped raining here in Brantford...  I think I might go..  PM me their route! lolol...
390900,[email protected],2009-10-07 03:36:00,290,I'm there now sitting in my car. The rain seems to have stopped...
390910,young_one,2009-10-07 06:20:00,620,best of luck! I'll be fishing in a few hrs in the morning at the east tribs.
391051,CLofchik,2009-10-07 18:35:00,854,"Got out later in the morning, the breeze was good to add some ripples to the water but all the rain made it too murky.  Fished for an hour without a touch then tried a few other spots around the harbour looking for some brownies but came up skunked."
