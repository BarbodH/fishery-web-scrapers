390631,Raf,2009-10-06 14:07:00,3495,"do it once and do it right, spend the $$$ on goretex.  i have the bps 100mph bibs and the cabela's guidewear jacket (i don't like the nascar'esque gawdy advertising the bps 100mph suits have) they will be the last rain apparel you will buy.  both offer lifetime warranty.. if they leak, bring them back and you will get replacements on the spot.  mine are un-insulated but i buy a size larger so that i can layer up underneath during the cold months and still be comfortable in the summer.  they're breathable so no sweating your balls off."
390640,solopaddler,2009-10-06 14:38:00,8605,"Echoing Raf, a good goretex suit is the best fishing related purchase you will ever make. Spend the money you won't regret it."
390643,scugpg,2009-10-06 15:03:00,1373,Is BPS the only ones who carry them or are there local retailers as well?
390652,solopaddler,2009-10-06 16:01:00,8605, Check out Mountain Equipment Co-op. Shipping is usually free so it doesn't really matter that there's not one close to you.
390653,irishfield,2009-10-06 16:05:00,26272,I echo what Raf said as well. Leah and I both have Gortex coats and pants. Best $1000 we ever spent considering we're at the lake 5 months/year. We've never got wet and haven't even bothered to use the extra zipper.
390672,bigbuck,2009-10-06 18:26:00,2449,"Spend as much as you can afford. Cheap suits are just that,they will last 1 or 2 outings then fall apart. Spend the extra dough and you will get much more enjoyment out of it."
390673,scugpg,2009-10-06 18:34:00,1373, I did that with my floater suit and waders....probably going to do the same here. I'll see what Angling Outfitters has and go from there.
390674,Fang,2009-10-06 18:36:00,1330,Yep Gortex all the way. I've blown out 5-6 regular ones of all sorts of price points.  One of the most important tips i could provide is to make sure you buy one that has a double baffle over the front zipper.
390699,jimmer,2009-10-06 20:13:00,2730,"I am also looking for a new rainsuit.  I have been using a wetskins for the past few years and it has served me well, but I did not like the hood.  It doesn't really close or tie down tight, so usually get soaked when running the boat.  Does anyone know if they changed the hood style to a full hood? I have a couple of buddies that use the Frogg Toggs and they swear by them.  You have to order them from the States though.  I think they are about $100."
390728,Roy,2009-10-06 22:22:00,13728, You can buy them in Ontario also...check out the Ontario dealers for one near you. http://www.froggtoggs.com/locatedealer/loc...te.asp?State=ON  And welcome aboard.
389930,scugpg,2009-10-04 20:38:00,1373,"I was wondering what you guys like for rainsuits. Already have waders but would like a rainsuit for the boat that can handle the wind. Not sure if I can justify the 100mph suits at BPS, but wanted to know what you guys like. It has to be breathable though no yellow suits for me"
389931,Radnine,2009-10-04 20:40:00,1538,"Good question, me too. I am still using my golf rain suit and it ain't cutting it. Jim"
389932,TDunn,2009-10-04 20:42:00,680,I have a pair of gander mountain TecH2O unisulated and a pair of cabela's guide wear insulated bibs.... No complaints about either.... gander mountain is very reasonable...But it is in the USA so i dont know if your close enough to drive or if you would have to ship.... Northface jacket that is not uninsulated and when its cold I just wear a helly hanson floater in the boat....  TDunn
389939,Leecher,2009-10-04 20:49:00,7832,Here is the one I bought at CTC and not expensive $60 plus tax    Better than the yellow one I had and it's insulated. Leechman
389941,scugpg,2009-10-04 20:50:00,1373, Hoping to find one in Canada - I too have the orange beacon suit for the cold weather boating but she gets hot fast when its not to bad!
389968,Twocoda,2009-10-04 21:29:00,4130,im the same a leechman ...wetskins are best bang of the buck ...64 bucks at CTC...mine is blue though ..
389974,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 21:36:00,8163,"I love my Frogg Toggs! Water and wind proof, but very light weight!  They're also inexpensive, about $60 for the hooded jacket and bib ""overall"" type pants suit together!"
389977,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-04 21:40:00,3761,Too bad ya don't like yellow. I also got a Wetskins rain suit and I love it $144 at Canadian tire 2-pc and it's warm also.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/Appa...2C%2BYellow.jsp  And believe me it has been well used!
389983,ColdH20guy,2009-10-04 21:48:00,312,I'm with leechman and twocoda..picked one up a few weeks ago when they were on sale at CTC..blue as well..great buy and comfortable!
389985,Burtess,2009-10-04 21:49:00,901,"If you have a Costco membership (or know someone who does) they usually carry the Wetskins brand as well.  The price can't be beat, and the ones that they stock have more pockets than the ones at Canadian Tire.   Colours are not yellow, usually grey and navy.  Some have a removable fleece liner.   Not breathable, but good none the less.  Burt"
389986,hooksetgod,2009-10-04 21:50:00,9,I always wear my Mustang Survival suit when fishing on a boat. It can get as high as 90' and I'll still wear it. Rain or shine I'll aways wear mine. lol
390017,HTHM,2009-10-04 22:48:00,4082,I have a helly hansen two piece suit that I bought on the east coast. Darn near indistructable and I use it at work as well.
390026,jaydub,2009-10-04 22:55:00,145,"Although I didn't buy one, CTC sells a nice Shimano suit that is regularly $140 but has been on sale for $100 this summer and maybe will be again as an end of season sale.  It looks like a great rain suite but was out of my price range for this year."
390034,Governator,2009-10-04 23:05:00,879,"I bought the cheapest green one from CTC (It was like $30-40)..... worst.idea.ever.  The thing rips so easily, lasted about 3 outings.  Ran in to a guy at a lake who had the same one and his whole butt was sticking out too lol.  I'm hoping santa brings me a real one."
390038,SlowPoke,2009-10-04 23:08:00,2984,"I have insulated rain gear from Mark's Work Warehouse. Windriver brand. Outstanding. Parka, detachable hood and pants, black and substantially cheaper the BPS and Cabela's top offerings. Be warned, they are very warm!"
390044,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-10-04 23:21:00,53,"Dropped the wad on a 1oo mph BPS suit a few weeks back. It hasn't stopped raining since I got it home. Thinking about takin it back and trading it for snorkel gear. LOL I gave it a good workout on the ATV the other day, worked great. I should really put it to the test next weekend at Lady Evelyn..........rain and wet snow forecasted so far."
390047,troutologist,2009-10-04 23:30:00,951,"I was in the same boat a few years ago. Asked the question on the board here and was advised that 100mph were the way to go. I boat the guidewear (on sale at cabelas) and they are great. However, if you are sitting in heavy rain expect to look like you wet yourself after.  Otherwise great, super durable and warm."
390055,acmarou,2009-10-04 23:50:00,63,Helly Hanson. Picked them up 2 yrs ago at Lebaron. No complaints.

390199,Bondar,2009-10-05 03:45:00,817,"I bought a wetskins from COSTCO in London its olive green and black Breathable good pockets , just the elastic was tight in the waist so i cut it and just use the supplied belt , I wore it in the rain today for 6 hours and didnt get wet at all , best 60 bucks ive spent in a bit"
390228,ohhenrygsr,2009-10-05 11:12:00,947,The higher quality wet skins suit aren't bad.  I recently bought a viking 2 piece suit love it..  But in a couple of years i will fall off my wallet and get a Gore-Tex suit 100MPH
390268,goteeboy,2009-10-05 13:35:00,175,"i got a used, but excellent condition bps 100mph goretex and love it. it goes for over 200 but i got it for 100 onebay."
390469,joep,2009-10-06 00:21:00,2,"For the money,I don't think you're going to find one better than the $65 Wet-Skins at Canadian Tire.  I went to BPS and Lebaron and tried on just about every rainsuit that wasn't mega-$$$$$ and the Wet-Skins was by far the best..even better than ones that cost double.  I used it yesterday and we stayed totally dry and warm in some pretty severe rain.  The material breathes and they aren't restrictive at all for casting etc....As for how durable they are...they seem very well made but time will tell.  Though I'm sure they will all wear out and rip sooner or later so I think I'd just get another one when that happens."
390625,F_ast,2009-10-06 13:53:00,154,I have had no problems with my Viking 2 from Marks work wearhouse.  Grey jacket and pant and a wicked price.  Tons of colour options too.
390627,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-06 13:58:00,1022, I saw this suit last night and it was real nice. Not insulated though.
