390375,redneck666,2009-10-05 18:53:00,563,"to be honest with you guys, the only fish i can really I.D. are brookies, pike, walleye, perch, lake trout, LM and SM bass, and whitefish.... cat fish... the ones that dont take much to tell apart haha! i just love fishin but maybe i should take more time to i.d. my fish."
390377,snag,2009-10-05 19:02:00,1932, Your in good company around here then!  Nice catches!
390405,redneck666,2009-10-05 20:01:00,563," hmmm.... if you compare a photo of an atlantic to my ""stellhead"" lol you can tell its an atlantic.... but they were feeding like crazy even in early july late june. but they have moved out same with the whitefish... they'll probably be in there next year."
390406,redneck666,2009-10-05 20:05:00,563,"all you guys wait till next spring..... well, summer, when brookies open. i'll put up some pics of the brookies i catch from creek fishin. the thing is alot of people either overlook the creeks or dont bother travelling up the creeks to the bigger holes. biggest i got from a creek in town here is 12"". but hey, i got a secret pond too where you can catch 16""-18""ers almost every cast from shore no matter the weather conditions."
390420,solopaddler,2009-10-05 20:55:00,8605,"Nice fish dude, but yeah for gawds sake learn how to ID your fish LOL!  The steelhead and the pink are both atlantics   .  Living in the soo you should be aware that the rapids sees a huge run of atlantics. Peaks in July but you'll find the odd one there almost any month."
390538,troutologist,2009-10-06 02:31:00,951,"  And how ARL LSSU this site will let you know what fish are running and you can practice you id on the fish cam.  Tight regs on the atlantics, so it could be a costly mistake."
390668,redneck666,2009-10-06 18:05:00,563,"well, i never keep more than 1 salmon a day and when one type of salmon is out of season i dont even bother with the rest. and im also no great salmon angler by any means, i just love the fight."
390711,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-06 20:55:00,0, it's just good to know what you're catching my friend.  especially when you're posting pics on a website that so full of excellent salmonid anglers.
389802,redneck666,2009-10-04 05:14:00,563,"well, im not too sure how this is going to go but here they are, fishin pictures from around the algoma district.  steelhead (looked bigger than it does in the picture) caught on the whitefish setup. lol i chased this thing down the pier trying to cast the tear drop in front of its mouth about 4 times and on the 5th, it finally took it.   whitefish caught on tear drop with split shot 3 feet up the line. caught off the western pier at soo locks   small lake trout caught at a lake that will remain un-named, only got this one trout there but theres deffinately plenty more than that.... it was caught on a mepps furry aglia #3 i believe. we shoulda caught more but do to improper trolling and poorly picked still fishing spots, we once again only got that one. i wont be makin the same mistakes again lol.   pink salmon caught with a glow in the dark 3/4oz little cleo first cast about 7:00pm august 28th     king salmon caught by drifting roe below the power house at soo locks at about 7:30am it measured 28""   i dont know if you can see this picture but, this is my 12 inch perch caught by st joseph island on a plain hook and worm without a sinker at about 7:00pm august 20th   there are more photos but i have no clue where the ones of my 'eyes went....."

389972,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-04 21:34:00,0,not telling you to be a dink...more because it's important to be able to ID the fish you catch considering that they have special regulations... do your homework homeboy.  look at a few of your pics and see what you find!!  is that a steelhead?  is that a pink?  http://www.fishcreeksalmon.org/atlantic-salmon-id.htm

390117,splashhopper,2009-10-05 01:19:00,2931,"excellent effort on getting the pics up...  pretty good for a ""redneck"""
390152,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-05 01:58:00,0,Looks like some great fishing in the Algoma area. Lot of variety too. Thanks for sharing.
390154,StoneFly,2009-10-05 02:01:00,574,I think the first Fish is an atlantic....Dave caught one today about the same size...maybe he can chime in with Fresh eyes....
390168,BillM,2009-10-05 02:32:00,17367,"Those first two fish(not the whities) are Atlantics for sure, look at the spots and the size of the mouths.  Last skinny fish looks to be a chinny."
390225,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-05 10:54:00,2038,They all look like '' Green '' Trout to me..
