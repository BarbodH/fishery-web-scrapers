This fish was on the bank still alive so I took a couple pics of it's crazy teeth and pushed it back in the water. It swam away but was surely down to it's last few minutes of existance.      Dead salmon all over the place with plenty live ones still spawning. Glad to report that I didn't see anyone snagging today.  Must admit that salmon fishing in the river is really not my thing. Maybe that's just because I suck at it.  Later Laz"
