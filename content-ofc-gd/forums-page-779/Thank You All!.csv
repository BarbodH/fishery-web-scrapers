390441,Joey,2009-10-05 22:54:00,9122,"I'd like to thank everyone for their outpouring of support this past week and especially today.  It is not easy to lose a parent and so many of you have shared your stories and experiences with me to help guide me through this time in my life.  I really want to thank all of you.  When I got to the church today my ""stepmother"" said ""There are flowers from some fishing people here!""  She seemed genuinely shocked.  I told her they were from the Ontario Fishing Network Community and she just couldn't seem to grasp the whole community of fishermen who cared about me!  I told her they cared about all of their members and what a great bunch of people we are and that we did care.  She just said ""wow!""  I'd like to thank the members who could make it, Spiel, Cliff, DouG, and the ones who intended to but could not, Wayne & Leah, Brian & Betty.  Rich and Patsy for the card awaiting me when I got home today, and all the thoughts and well wishes from everyone, including the card Cliff gave me today Carole.  You've made this time in my life a whole lot easier to transition through.  I will remember it always.  And of course to Roy, who was always there, day and night, on the phone and on MSN at 4 a.m. when I couldn't sleep.  THANK YOU!!  Joey"
