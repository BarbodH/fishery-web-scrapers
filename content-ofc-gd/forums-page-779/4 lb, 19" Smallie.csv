Friday night my neighbour Mark and I decided to cast off of my dock using various methods. I went to my trusty Arbogast Jitterbug in the Frog/White Belly colour and Mark was changing lures so fast I wasn't sure what he had on. After about 30 minutes or see, I hear a small bubble sound and I immediately realize there is something decent on so i set the hook and the battle ensued. The noise was hard to describe, almost like the fish is inhaling the lure and water at the same time. So I reel in and once again it was pitch black and I hollered at Mark to grab the net. The battle was over pretty quick and I was able to hoist the beast on 30# PP up onto the dock. I could see exactly how big it was and thought it was going to be close to the 21"" beast I caught a few weeks ago. Having Mark there was a definate help as we got the weight and measurement very quickly and he snapped 2 decent shots that I was able to trim right on the camera for a closer shot.  After all was said and down this monster Smallie measured 19"" and weighed exactly 4 lbs on the nose. I can't believe this isn't my PB..........   for most people it might have been. She was released right away.  Dirk   By diggyj, shot with DSC-S730 at 2009-10-05   By diggyj, shot with DSC-S730 at 2009-10-05"
