Figured I'd hit the upper tribs before they closed so I went out last weekend. Was mostly in search of specks but had a nice surprise at the end of the day.  Didn't take pics of all the specks but here are a few... Didn't get any real big specks but a few nice ones in the 8-10"" range.       This next pic is quite interesting. I thought I had an average fish when all of a sudden it started to pull twice as hard...    Apparently the hook went through the chubs mouth and a brookie tried to steal it...   Managed to get into a couple little resident bows like this guy.    Apparently I wasn't the only one interested in closing weekend. These guys showed up to see what was going on...      And finally on to the last fish of the day, which turned out to be quite a nice surprise. I had hiked my way to a small log jam I found earlier this spring that had a few brookies around to check it out. First cast I get a nice hit and I knew I had a nice sized fish on. I was hoping to see my PB brookie but instead found a nice brown. I wasn't too disappointed though  .  Was fishing by myself so I couldn't get a good pic and wanted to release him ASAP so here's the best I could do.    As always when fishing for these smaller trout single barbless hooks were the order of the day. And all fish were put back right were I found them. Now it's time to start thinking about those bigger trout."
