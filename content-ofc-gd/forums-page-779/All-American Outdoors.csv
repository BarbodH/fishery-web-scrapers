Just looking to see if this site is reliable and wont rip me off with my credit card information.  Thanks, MTBF  http://www.all-americanoutdoors.com/home"
390477,ADB,2009-10-06 00:44:00,444,"I added an item to my cart and entered my postal code so it could estimate shipping.  It gave me this:  Available shipping options:  International Orders - Exact amount via USPS - Calculate at ship time  Your answer, Mike:  If you buy the reel, expect your credit card to be charged additional shipping at a later date once they calculate the exact price.  This has nothing to do with the site's integrity."

390483,splashhopper,2009-10-06 00:47:00,2931," That just goes to show how long it's been that I have bought beer,  One Day at a Time"
390489,JustinHoffman,2009-10-06 00:53:00,482,"Have ordered from them a couple of times in the past - shipping was about $10 and I was charged the exact amount as was listed on the package. That was nice to see for a change.  Reputable company and I've had no issues..  Good Fishing,  Justin"
390549,kickingfrog,2009-10-06 03:05:00,8333,A few other members have bought products from them and have had good things to say. If you use the search function you should find some of the posts.
390555,muskymike,2009-10-06 03:40:00,772,"I know Garrett has used them and like kickingfrog said, a few others.  There were a few posts about them a year or so ago, nothing bad was said about them. And their prices are great.  PM Garrett, if I recall correctly, you could quote OFC and they will help you out. Dont know if thats still going on though."
390714,aplumma,2009-10-06 21:04:00,6896,They are a most excellent site. I have purchased reels from them over the last few years and never had an issue with them. I how ever can not address the shipping question but can vouch for their integrity.   Art
