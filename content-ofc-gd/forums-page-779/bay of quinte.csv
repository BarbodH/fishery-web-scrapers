I really don't know where to start on this big body of water.  I don't even know where to find a boat launch.  I was thinking of going to Napanee.  Any help of a location of a boat launch or any tips would be greatly appreciated.   thanks,  lovetofish     Ps.  i have brand new planner boards and i figured this would be a good spot to try them out"

390521,irishfield,2009-10-06 01:59:00,26272,I would have been all over Fishhunters offer for a day on the bay for the cost of fuel.. and then go out in your own boat the next day with your new learned knowledge...
390525,fishhunter,2009-10-06 02:04:00,604,have a look in hook ups.
390537,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-10-06 02:30:00,53,I'm not sure how/if it will affect the fishing but CBC Radio reported today that a severe blue-green algae bloom is occuring in Quinte right now. Jack.

390558,west lake charlie,2009-10-06 03:47:00,40,"there is a board for quinte quintefishing.com it will help you out bud,  There is a nice boat launch in picton, alot of people troll east of glenora.   There is also a boat launch at the glenora marina but only if you have a nice 4wd to pull it out there.  If you fish east of the glenora ferry you can use 2 rods per person.  I picked up some maps for the area I think from hotspots maps.  I hope that helps you out man.  charlie"
390570,young_one,2009-10-06 06:59:00,620,"May I add, one of our sponsor site, www.fishingbayofquinte.com also has very good beginner information on Fall walleye. Check out their maps of boat launch and forum section.  Fishhunter offers a great oppertunity with the hookups, you'll learn plenty. I joined once last year, and immediately after with my own equipments, I had success catching."
