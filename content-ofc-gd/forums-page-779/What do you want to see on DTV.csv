390753,fisherman7,2009-10-06 23:30:00,325,"I'd like to see bloopers as well. Also, maybe take a kid fishing or someone who has never fished before."
390779,danbouck,2009-10-07 00:05:00,4380,"  I like this one. Between Ryan and Dave they have both ends of the ""Bucket Talk"" covered"
390783,Greencoachdog,2009-10-07 00:31:00,8163,Dave fishin' from a tiller type boat... Dave cleaning and filleting a limit of Wall-ice.... bikini clad assistants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
390871,Leecher,2009-10-07 02:35:00,7832,"You got some good feedback so far Dave and I think, to put it simply, keep up the great work   as mentioned before, would be great to see the tweaking of the lures for enticing finicky fish and plan of action on new body of water.  I enjoy watching those DTV segments!!! Again great work Dave Leechman"
390872,HTHM,2009-10-07 02:36:00,4082,"In the same line as JohnF, perhaps some segments on different reel types, how to pitch, or how to flip, how to use a very long rod as opposed to a shorter one. When to use a paticular rod for a paticular application, and so on. Or to put it another way, more tips. I am unable to get your show as it is not on network TV so this is the only way that I am able to be entertained and educated by yourself. Thanks for what you do."
390875,pike slayer,2009-10-07 02:46:00,1177,"ya i say fish some back lakes, places where that big fast expensive boat of yours can't go. try new waters and an attack plan and actually doing it and learning how to fish new lakes. also some hot ""assistants"" would really add to it also!"

391005,Fang,2009-10-07 16:30:00,1330,"Great post Dave,  I would love to see a few Dave + a fan shows. Love the Lunkerville concept but I think it could be taken to another level with the show host guiding someone for a day.  Not to steal from JP's show but as an industry the ICAST show is so poorly covered. Would love to see Facts of Fishing do an in depth product, and interveiw show from ICAST on what's coming out in retail  A show on the tournament scene in Canada and what it takes to get involved as an amatuer angler. Great lead in the spring as a one stop reference for getting ready.  Love to see a day in the life,..... CO's, biologists, MNR staff, even more on independent organizations like ringwood hatchery  the bizarre alternate species are always enjoyable. Last few years great shows have been done on sturgeon, sharks and of course alligator gar.  Cudo's on getting out of your comfort range too Dave. Enjoyed the fly fishing show. Like the centerpin idea. what about some more ice fishing stuff. There's only so many bass I can see being caught."
391039,misfish,2009-10-07 18:00:00,29133,"  I believe this is what JPD,S show is all about.IMO.     Dave yer crazy.Keep it up. And yes,I too would like to see the dropshot more.With underwater  cameras videoing the strikes."
391041,BITEME,2009-10-07 18:06:00,1968,"To be honest I dont watch fishing shows at least not since red fisher and if I was that means Im not out fishing and for me thats bad a suggestion: I cant think of any, people seem to like you just do what you do,. I hear you eat alot of subs though"
391043,Headhunter,2009-10-07 18:12:00,5703,"All good suggestions above! Based on the amount of bad press fishing has received of late, I would like to see something that discusses fishing ethics. I believe that both sides of that issue, could use some knowledge and experience and I feel that your unique style would lend itself to many folks. I wouldn't expect that to change everyone, but if a few folks gain some knowledge, well, it's like that hair commercial from years ago... he told two friends and they told two friends... HH  ****Or if that doesn't work, you could always do a segment on the advantages of coloured marshmellows vs plain old white!"
391098,Ben_Daniels,2009-10-07 22:49:00,435,"   Yea I gotta agree, I hate watching that infomercial...I mean fishing show. 20 minutes of plugging different products and then 5-10 minutes of actual fishing, I think I actually saw more fishing in the Line Dancer infomercial.  -Ben"
390682,Dave Mercer,2009-10-06 19:32:00,148,"Hi Guys, I hope all is well with everyone. I want to thank everyone that has been watching the DTV segments. Some DTV segments are tips, some are news, and some are reports from fishing events. My question to all my fellow OFC'ers is what do you want to see in these segments. What can we do to make them better and is there something that we are missing? It's your chance to be my producer and tell me what to do! It does not mean i will listen but I will try.  Look forward to your feedback.  Dave Mercer"

I see that on your site, I can click on ""video blog"" and see all of them from the beginning. Personally, I enjoy the tips, but variety is good too. Tell me, will there one day be a kind of a compendium with all the fishing tips listed in there?  Keep up the work... and the laugh doesn't hurt either."
390688,GBW,2009-10-06 19:42:00,8460,run clips of out takes from time to time. how and when to use a bait as well.

390692,trout-eater,2009-10-06 19:55:00,21,"stop chuckling like  a girl, and stay away from the great lakes, yes we know, they produce big fish.  would love to see segments on more local lakes ( SMALL ONES)    and yes i love your show!!! you make me laugh all the time.  especially when you squirt some alive ""sauce"" in the mouth of a smallie, priceless!!"
390695,legacey,2009-10-06 20:04:00,127,"How about me in your boat!  Seriously though, I suggested this on the WFN forum sometime back when they asked about programming and still think it would make for an interesting show or addition to an existing show...  Something I like to refer too as The ""Reel People!""  A show that is about shore fisher people...visiting local hot spots (TO harbor, BOQ shores and the likes for example) and talking to those fishing from land (or ice) and possibly add in those coming back in boats etc. for interviews.  Tips, tricks, tackle, equipment, what to look for in harbors or land structures, as well as etiquette, timing for fish spawning (crappy, perch...) and availbility, etc  Reading a lot of forum information over the past years, there's a lot of questions on where to fish from shore, what to use etc. And where / how better to get people into fishing, sharing the knowledge and understanding that you don't have to spend a lot of money or time trying to locate these fish and can have fun with program like this?  I know watching most of the current shows, there's a lot of glitter, expense, time and effort....it really can and would be nice to see the ""grass-roots"" approach once again we all learned doing and from...the mighty shore line of your favorite watering hole.  ....take an adult fishing and he'll (eventually) take a kid with him!  By the way...please feel free to contact me Dave.  Cheers  Paul"
390697,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-06 20:10:00,3761,"Your segments are great Dave keep up the good work. Maybe some stuff like johnny said, tweaking baits, favorite baits on local spots like Scugog.  Honestly your show has put the fishing world into a new and better view and I just love it. Try your best to tell us when things like seminars are and your 100%. That and it's always good to see your buddy's like JP.  5/5 on your recent and future success! MTBF  O ans a guest once and awhile on your show would be good also!"
390698,Dave Mercer,2009-10-06 20:11:00,148,All great ideas so far and Trout eater you will be happy because this season we did a few shows on very small water. Please remember it's not the Facts of Fishing show we are talking about here it's the Dave TV web segments that are at the top of this page we are looking for feedback on. Thanks and keep up the great feedback
390701,BillM,2009-10-06 20:15:00,17367,"Dave, I'd like to see you with a center pin in your hand (Maybe that would make for a good episode for Facts of Fishing)  "
390702,JohnF,2009-10-06 20:27:00,3494,"This may sound inane but until I came here (OFC) I had no idea there was a difference between a Walleye Boat and a Bassboat for example. I think it might be interesting for viewers to see an overview/comparison of the different boat styles and configurations popular in Ontario. You could show examples of the high and low ends of those various types cost and equipment wise, and demonstrate what in partivcular makes them better suited to certain types of fish and fishing.  Another thing might be some good U/W video of our favourite gamefish in their natural habitat, something more than fast cuts from fish to fish as fill between show segments. I've seen a lot of them in my diving adventurers - huge catfish, carp, pike, all flavours of bass, muskies, trout, perch and walleye in our local waters - and I've rubbed shoulders, literally, with big Tarpon in Grand Cayman, touched sharks in Mexico, been lovingly embraced by a big Green Moray off the Florida Keys, etc etc. It's really interesting to watch them and to see how they interact or ignore when not being stuck with hooks etc. For whatever reason they usually just ignore a slow moving diver. I guess they think it's just a seriously ugly fish. What it means to me now as an angler is that I have a good idea of how the fish acts while grazing, hanging out or just cruisin' and that helps me to envision him responding to my lure, bait, whatever. There are some who might justifiably argue that it doesn't seem to have helped my own fishing skills but to them I can only say ""Think how bad I could have been without this insight.""  Perhaps a short video on the relative merits of the different styles of minnow buckets in human waste composting??  JF"
390704,LeXXington,2009-10-06 20:37:00,1928,Lets See -- First I would love too see  longer DTV segments.  I really would love to watch the TV show on more TV channels  The Score and WFN got out voted in my family with Family Channel and Discovery Kids
390705,TC1OZ,2009-10-06 20:42:00,987,Keep them coming!!!  If I knew what information I needed I wouldn't be watching your clips! hahaha!
390707,acmarou,2009-10-06 20:44:00,63," I'll second that!!! I saw Dave flyfishing last week, or the week before, and couldn't believe my eyes. Pretty cool seeing him wave that fairy wand and nailing fish!!  :lol: I'd love to see him with a centrepin. I'm sure he'd figure it out in no time and teach some of us something as well."
390708,Roy,2009-10-06 20:45:00,13728,UMMMM  And here I thought that the question was about the WEB segments.      THESE!  Available by clicking on these images on our board.

390715,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-06 21:11:00,0,How about working on more lures/rods/reels with your name on it and showing how they catch fish. People just eat that stuff up. I still have a bill dance fat free shad and I dont think I hardly used it but I had to have it.lol

I want to see what to look for on the fish finder. How to set it up(which most already know)and then actually jigging for it and seeing the strike and what to do.Deep water and shallow water.

( yes i know that is how it is all paid for,... but geesh.... the pro fishermen can do better than those guys that just ""turn left"" all day and yak  about their sponsors.   )  3) Introduce some kids/ families to your segments.  4) Have an interactive segment or two teaching someone how to use different set ups.. ie fly rods.. bait casters .. etc   And most important.... keep doing the fun stuff you are known for Dave..."

I know on one of your shows you talk about driving the lake looking at your sonar etc. But looking at at map, what are you looking for? I love the little graphics that you have on the show to illustrate boat position etc. more of that. I liked John F's suggestion about boat differences. We want to be educated Dave, can you help us??? I enjoy the DTV vids. Thanks! Jim"
