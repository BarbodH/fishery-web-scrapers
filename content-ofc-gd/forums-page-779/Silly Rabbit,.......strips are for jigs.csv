390252,misfish,2009-10-05 12:46:00,29133,    Nice work.
390253,kemper,2009-10-05 12:46:00,2232,"Looks good,  How do you find the narrow strip to tie with? Was it a narrow crosscut?  I tried to tie with the narrow strip once and found that the jigs came out snowball like with no shape to them, still worked though!  I love tyin jigs...give this pattern a try its been my best     gobble!"
390260,blaque,2009-10-05 13:04:00,2419," i had both narrow and narrow crosscut.............i did notice the difference in the overall body shape between the two kemper.  I wrap them pretty tightly and densely (overlap previous wraps) which helps ""lay down"" the wraps and keep them from looking too snowballish"

390271,tipupesox,2009-10-05 13:44:00,167,Nice looking jigs Blaque.  Tried fishing one of the medium sized tribs in the Southern Tier Sunday morning.  Water was brownish in color with around 6-8 inches of visability in the runs.  The fish were in and rolling around but were not willing to hit our presentations.  A torrential downpour occurred around 9:00 AM and the water turned chocolate.  Decieded to head home and take a nap before the football games started.  My go to jig colors are white or white and a hint of pink.  Creeks should be fishing well once they start to clear.  Tom
