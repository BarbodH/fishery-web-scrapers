390006,ccmtcanada,2009-10-04 22:22:00,7971,Love the deep colours on that pike!  I haven't tried the TO Pike in a while...maybe I should bring my gear to work on of these days...
390056,msp,2009-10-04 23:50:00,1336,"Did you say something about slamming strippers ? MMMMMMMMM Strippers........... Oh yeah, back to the pike, looks good to me ! Jerk B8 ?"
390060,highdrifter,2009-10-05 00:06:00,2534," Ya strippers are ""fun"" to.. ""catch"".  LC 100 SP, Clown.  Been doing some tweaking on my leaders and I've started using braid.  80lb mono is just too stiff and buoyant for slash baits..  "
390066,ehg,2009-10-05 00:14:00,2666,Was thinking i would wait until someone posted a pike from there before going down to harbourfront. Nice job and you probably made the right decision going for pike instead.  Maybe run into you again. Good stuff!
390070,highdrifter,2009-10-05 00:18:00,2534," Thanks bud.  Ya know where to find me!  Plus, I don't mind risking my life to land em.."
390071,WeedLine,2009-10-05 00:22:00,322,Good one Castro! Congrats on the engagement.
390074,highdrifter,2009-10-05 00:25:00,2534, Noticed I mentioned your name in the report?  Just to remind you that I'm still thinking boutcha!!  Thanks dude.
390102,splashhopper,2009-10-05 01:04:00,2931,"Nice pike....  and if your buddy is ""slaying strippers"" he may be some guy named bubba new ""buddy"" in da joint eh"
390391,highdrifter,2009-10-05 19:21:00,2534, 
390398,Harrison,2009-10-05 19:33:00,2202,"Nice fish bud.  I am going to take a walk tomorrow on lunch, I work right by the dome.  Probably get some looks in a suit with rods and gear on the Go train though."
390400,highdrifter,2009-10-05 19:48:00,2534, Funny you mention that.  Grant and I were thinking of getting decked out in our finest and getting thoroughly slimed by some gators.  Now that would make a kewl report!!  Thanks bud.  Go git em.
390402,Harrison,2009-10-05 19:58:00,2202,"Hmm, ya, never thought of that.  I gotta get a bib."
390430,GBW,2009-10-05 21:55:00,8460,"""But honey, I swear we we not chasing Strippers, that smell is pike!"""
390434,4thgen,2009-10-05 22:09:00,157,"Nice.  I used to fish down there all the time about a decade ago. It still blows my mind how many fish you can get that close to downtown. I remember one day on opener just after they imposed the season when we stopped counting at 50 fish two hours before we left. It was literally a pike every other cast.  It isn't nearly so consistent up here. I find they're either there or they aren't. I did manage 18 in about 4 hours a while ago, including 10 that were 34"" or better. I couldn't break the magic 40"" mark though despite three that went 38"".      "
390440,highdrifter,2009-10-05 22:45:00,2534," I've encountered the same thing.  They're nomadic creatures around these parts...  Could it be that they follow the baitfish??  Either way, those are some beauts!!  I've broken the 40 mark for a coupla times, xept for this year.  They're around though!!  MSP got one this spring in the area that was in the mid 40s at least, and I've seen some BIG post spawn females that were slinking along, recuping from their harassement, but have yet to tie into one of them yet..  You get those fish this year?  They put Snag's fish to shame dude HAHAAH!"
390634,4thgen,2009-10-06 14:18:00,157,"Not only this year, but all the same day. I've found the average here to blow away the lake O fish. I caught a 42"" each of the last two years and I'm about due this year.  I have seen some fish in the harbour that I would legitimately call mid forties, and a friend got a 44"" out of a float tube at one point. One thing I never saw for sure though was a muskie. I would kill for a picture of a musky caught in Toronto."
390754,snag,2009-10-06 23:31:00,1932," Agreed. you're still an   Dude, I really tried. It just didn't care.  I can't believe nobody else has caught or SEEN one here??"
390766,MJL,2009-10-06 23:42:00,2427,"Awesome Fidel!   You don't need 8pc rods for concealment...4pc rods will do.  Shove it down one pant leg and if the missus asks why you're walking funny, tell her you're packing some serious heat for later...Worked for me"
390769,highdrifter,2009-10-06 23:50:00,2534, I got a coupla pack rods but they're only 3pc...  Should do the trick though.  Shouldn't be too hard to stash in my long johns...  Thanks brah!!
389927,highdrifter,2009-10-04 20:27:00,2534,"Hey gang,  Was supposed to hit up a trib today for samskies but looked at the Hydrometric charts and decided against it...  Decided to terrorize some local gators instead.  Turns out it was not a bad idea.  Fish were on definetly on, in spite of the storm cell moving through.  Water was just hazy enough to keep the fish in ambush mode.  They would smash a bait just as it hovered over the weedline.  What a rush to see the takes.  I think I love piking again!  3pm was the happy hour today.  This fish took just after the dinner bell rang!    If only FHR was with me.. I hope he's slaying strippers on the coast.  Miss ya dawg.  cheers HD"
389934,tdotfisherman,2009-10-04 20:47:00,317,"Nice fish man. T.O. Pike are certainly on right now, and have been on for quite some time.. although there have been a real lack of GTA pike reports.."
389938,solopaddler,2009-10-04 20:49:00,8605,"Nice pike buddy!  So....you hope FHR is slaying ""strippers"" on the east coast?"
389940,raptorfan,2009-10-04 20:50:00,126,"Gorgeous lookin fish man.....you fishing from shore, or were you in a boat?"
389943,Leecher,2009-10-04 20:53:00,7832,Nice gator Fidel Good on ya for making that split decision     Sweet reward for your efforts!!! Thanks for sharing Jacques
389944,highdrifter,2009-10-04 20:56:00,2534, Shore bound this time.  The harbour police don't like when I tube in the harbor.
389945,highdrifter,2009-10-04 20:57:00,2534, Hah jeeze...
389946,highdrifter,2009-10-04 20:59:00,2534," That will soon change, once my photoshop skills are up to parr."
389950,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-04 21:04:00,3761,"crap man, nice fish. Ugh, would love to catch something right now, DAM this river lol  Thanks for sharing that biggin, MTBF"
389951,GBW,2009-10-04 21:05:00,8460,"then tie off to the back of a boat and say you are waiting for your ""uncle"" to fire up the boat and take you for a spin...  nice pike, I wish I was able to get out today but I think my wife would kill me, being her birthday and all..."
389952,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 21:07:00,8163,Now that there is a real purty Eel Socks!!!   ... but the dang holder is ruint!!!  Good on you getting out Bubba F!!!... and thanks for sharing!
389956,highdrifter,2009-10-04 21:17:00,2534, HAH!!  Unkie Herb is right around the corner I swear!!  Best you take care of biz today though.  One day is better than a lifetime of hurt!!  My ladie's birth date is next weekend. I gotta spend 2 days in Haliburton at this icky spa retreat and the gear has to stay at home!  BRUTAL.  If only they made an 8 piece baitcaster!
389958,highdrifter,2009-10-04 21:19:00,2534, She was a bit on the thin side.  Real purty face on her though!!  And the funk is wrong with my hold dawg??!!
389960,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 21:22:00,8163," ... it ain't the hold... it's the ""HOLDER""! (the one that holds the fish!)  Just kiddin' ya Bubba!"
389963,Joey,2009-10-04 21:23:00,9122,"Nice fish Fidel, great picture.  Hope you shaver gets repaired soon  Joey"
389965,GBW,2009-10-04 21:25:00,8460,"See, now you got it... Yup, it's been a whole weekend thing here too. Ouch, SPA and no fishing?  Can't you sneek out while she's in the spa?  Tell her your going to go get her *insert gift here* and you will be right back.  BTW, when you pack the car she doesn't know whats in the back...."
389970,highdrifter,2009-10-04 21:32:00,2534, Sorry dawg I just can't rock the wool like you can...
389973,highdrifter,2009-10-04 21:34:00,2534, But I'm supposed to let it grow!  I promissed the guys I'd be rocking a full muff for my bachelor party... IN VEGAS!!
389976,highdrifter,2009-10-04 21:38:00,2534, Ah I gotta dou it incognito eh?  That's the kind of thinking that's gonna git me in a heap dude!
389979,snag,2009-10-04 21:42:00,1932,"Hey Scruffy!  Nice pike thar.  Tis a good spot. Did you notice how that big ol weed bed is gone out there and it's all just on the wall. Weird  I'll skip on the ""hello"" kiss next time we meet. Ouch! :blush"
389982,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 21:47:00,8163, ... and the Snagglepuss rears his ugly head!!!... care for a bowl of collard greens?
389996,snag,2009-10-04 22:03:00,1932," Who you callin' ugly  I would care for some collard greens, In a ""large"" dixie cup with extra sauce  Thank you"
389998,Greencoachdog,2009-10-04 22:06:00,8163,  One large dixie cup of collards with extra sauce comin' right up!!!
389999,highdrifter,2009-10-04 22:13:00,2534," Yip I hear ya.  Some spots are absolutely void of cabbage, while others seem to be okay.  I probably has alot to do all the rain we had over the summer.  Murky water means less light penetration, and less light means less weed growth.  No biggy though, the spots that have cabbage will have more fish!!  And don't worry about my scruff.  It won't hurt... much.."
390001,highdrifter,2009-10-04 22:14:00,2534, You guys are messed up!!
