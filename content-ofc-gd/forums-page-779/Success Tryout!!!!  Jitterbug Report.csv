389724,Leecher,2009-10-03 22:03:00,7832,"Just got back from trying out the BUG and I just can't believe the results..... As promised, here is my report:  I left home around 2:00pm and got to Lac Leamy at 2:15pm.... tied on the BUG and not 10 minutes into trying..... BLOWOUT    SAW THE FISH COME OUT OF THE WATER    but just barely missed it    My heart stopped for a few seconds there  I kept trying that spot for a little while  but did not get any more strikes so I decided to shoot a video of the retrieve to show you guys how this thing worked.  Here is the video Simon style:    It works great but only one thing, have to keep the tip of the rod high so that it doesn't sink under   but that's OK by me  I kept walking along the shoreline and stopping ever so often to work specific areas but did not get any more blowouts..... so I decided to go back to where I first started earlier and what a good decision that was     check the video and you'll know why    This was the fourth time I got action and this time the pike did not miss the lure..... was I ever happy to finally land this beaut..... have to remember that I don't tie on leaders and with pike, had he swallowed the lure, would of snap me off...... here is another pic of it on shore    Now the BUG needs a new paint job cause it got scratches on it Here a couple of pics      So all in all that was absolutely the ultimate feeling of catching a fish on a lure that I made Thanks again to all that commented on my other post.... I will certainly make some adjustments for the next one I create.  Leechman"
389726,Dutchy,2009-10-03 22:09:00,416,Thats awesome Leechman. I used to get excited back in scotland when I caught trout on a fly I had tied. Its excellent. Everyone should try it.

389809,OhioFisherman,2009-10-04 07:06:00,6623,"Great! Always nice when a plan works! They used to make a larger one, Musky jitterbug, haven`t seen them around for a while.  Just a tip and you may be aware of it, fish blows up on your lure and misses it take something totally different, say like a soft plastic bait, eg. lizard and pitch it near the blow up, it might catch the missed fish."
389812,12footspringbok,2009-10-04 10:27:00,459,Good stuff nothing like seeing the fruits of your labour!

389832,Leecher,2009-10-04 13:48:00,7832, Thanks walleyejigger!!!  Real proud of it   Thanks splashhopper!!!   Thanks OhioFisherman!!!  Now you got me intrigued..... might just make a bigger one for gators   Thanks 12footspringbok!!!   Thanks Kevin!!!  Did you and Paul go bass fishing yesterday??
389833,jaydub,2009-10-04 13:55:00,145,"Wow, the action on that baby was pretty impressive   (who cares if you need to keep the tip up).  Gotta say, that thing seems to run a lot more like the real deal than I would have guessed.  I've never made a lure, but I can imagine it's a pretty good feeling when you land a fish on one of your own!  Great report!!  BTW  Did you know there were snot rockets in there, if so, that's pretty risky fishing your homemade lure without a leader don't you think?  Imagine this post if it was just a story about ""the one that got away""...with your lure. It just wouldn't have been the same."
389843,Leecher,2009-10-04 14:30:00,7832," Thanks Jay!!!  Very impressed with the action also.  One thing, it doesn't produce the flocking sound as loud as the real deal but works the same.  Like I said previously you must raise the tip of the rod high when you start the retrieve and once it wobbles, can lower the tip  I knew there was pike in the area I was fishing and was kind of gutsy to not tie on a leader but I did not expect to get a hit from a snot rocket let alone any fish  It was pretty cool to see this snake finally nail the bug and the ultimate feeling when I landed it   B) Jacques"
389851,GBW,2009-10-04 15:08:00,8460,"good job Jacques, you must be very happy.  I would be..."
