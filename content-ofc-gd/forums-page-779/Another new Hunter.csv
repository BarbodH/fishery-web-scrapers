I sold some of my bass gear to my friend and have a bit extra to spend for the first gun.  I might settle for Rem Wingmaster 12g in the worst case  Need the gun mostly for birding but might get into big game as well.   Thanks!"
390302,BITEME,2009-10-05 15:11:00,1968,Never owned an eagle but have heard noting bad supposedly a fantastic gun good luck and welcome to the lost art
390307,Steel28,2009-10-05 15:25:00,160,Thanks BM!! Always wanted to hunt and finally decided to cut my fishing time so now my dream came true.

Personally I love my Nova Pump. Benelli makes some great guns, also look into the Beretta Extrema 2 with the kick off. My dad loves it."
390373,dave524,2009-10-05 18:46:00,4508,"  Just a thought, for the difference in price between an 870 and the Benelli you could probably buy a respectable rifle for big game."
