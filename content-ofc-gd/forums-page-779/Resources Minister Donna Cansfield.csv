I would think since the goverment is making these decisions,is there a chance of a lawsuit if someone is killed? Just thinking out load.  No spring bear hunt    Home with the flu.Nothing else to do but surf."
390249,GBW,2009-10-05 12:40:00,8460,"In the past 10+ years we have never had a bear on the property at the cottage, this year we had one.  Even though I don't hunt I say open the season up."
390292,edmichit,2009-10-05 14:48:00,145,"Agree, when will they put a hunter in charge? Since the cancellation of the spring hunt, most nuisance bears, that could have been harvested (meat and hides utilized), are still being shot. The only difference now is the implementation of the Triple S policy. Shoot, Shovel, Shut Up. so yes the population is exploding, despite what the gov'ts interputation, of the results are."
390293,BillM,2009-10-05 14:54:00,17367,There are more bears where my parents live (Coldwater) then there ever have been before..  There needs to be a open season.

The bear wise program is a farce...we called it once...""there is a bear in our backyard, around the crab apple tree""..bear wise; ""go outside and take the crab apples down""...me:""you dont understand...the bear is in the backyard, around the crab apples""...bear wise:....silence!  Thanks for the help..."
390313,CLofchik,2009-10-05 15:42:00,854, When hunters raise the same amount of slush funds & votes that a clueless Libtard soccer mom from Etobicoke can.
390314,LeXXington,2009-10-05 15:49:00,1928,"You get what you vote for, If anything the tree huggers are much more of a force than hunters and fishermen.  Call, write, donate to who you want in power.  Otherwise, gather up all the bears and send them too the Toronto Island"

390457,Kerry,2009-10-06 00:01:00,383," Yeah, Haven't been down the river this year,but the last two years you gotta keep your ears open if you're in the boat down between Coldwater and Fesserton especially if you tie off to the reeds and want to drift fish the holes.I saw four in total last year.I heard there was a real nasty male hanging around Lawson Line last year.
