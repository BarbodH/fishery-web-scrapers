389683,Chris,2009-10-03 17:12:00,405,This used to be on CHEZ 106 Ottawa during the 90's. Don't know if it was on the air elsewhere. I think it was comedy duo McLean & McLean that originally did it.    
389685,Radnine,2009-10-03 17:21:00,1538,"I'm laughing just thinking about it. Thanks. In these parts it was done on Q107 by a guy called Brother Jake (Jake Edwards) I think. But I remember someone doing it before him, I think. The you-tube clip sounds like I remember it on Q107 with Jake Edwards. I think. Jim"

389691,raptorfan,2009-10-03 17:41:00,126,"Me and some buddies were sitting around the other night talking about ""The Champ"", he was awesome.  One episode that really stuck in our head was when Mrs Champ went to Chicago to stay with and see Michael Jordan.  When the Champ asked MJ how Mrs. Champ liked Chicago, he said she really enjoyed their Blackhawks......I said pardon?"
389697,JohnF,2009-10-03 18:05:00,3494,A few years back I was into curling. So one night the four of us were driving to a neighbouring club for the Mutual (for any who curl around here) and our second sticks a tape (or cd) in the dashboard. It was the Champ. We howled the whole way there and once we hit the ice we couldn't stop reciting the lines. Of course we cracked ourselves up - and demolished our game. The other rink must have thought we were nuts. The year before we were nearly unbeatable and that year we were gone immediately.  Damn the Champ!  JF
389701,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-10-03 18:44:00,53,"The Champ is classic! I've got 3 Champ CD's in the boat and every time I get together with a fishing bud of mine from that era we play them til we pee. My fav album is ""Twas The Fight Before Christmas"""

389885,hooksetgod,2009-10-04 17:48:00,9,I played golf this summer at a charity event where Jake was entertaining some of the players while on the putting green. You can only imagine what the 'Champ' stories sound like when some 'colorful' language and 'non-radio acceptable' stories are told!! He had 10 guys near peeing themselves.lol
