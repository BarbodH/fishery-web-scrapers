390809,solopaddler,2009-10-07 01:30:00,8605,What can I say? I was inspired by Doug's post and thought I'd share my own cam pic's.  I've had a rash of thefts lately down by the dock. Small shiny things usually....although a pack of chewing gum and a box of Twinkies mysteriously disappeared last week.  Unnerved by the happenings I installed a camera and was able to capture this incredible footage!  The regular cam produced a blurry but disturbing image:     When the infrared kicked in this startling image materialized:     Apparantly the rare and ellusive manther is attracted to musky baits!

390823,highdrifter,2009-10-07 01:47:00,2534,Yee wha???!!    
390825,kickingfrog,2009-10-07 01:48:00,8333,I think I've seen one of those... 
390837,irishfield,2009-10-07 02:05:00,26272,DANG.. I wonder if anything shiney is missing in my boat... man this thing gets around...  
390843,solopaddler,2009-10-07 02:10:00,8605,  BAHAHAHA!  He's devious beast Wayne you'd best be on your guard.

390854,Skud,2009-10-07 02:13:00,739,Doesn't everyone organize their lures like that?  It keeps the amateurs from using them.
390860,muskymike,2009-10-07 02:20:00,772,Is that a parasite? The twinkies missing doesnt surprise me....
390862,solopaddler,2009-10-07 02:23:00,8605,  Apparantly manthers like bright shiny things and brown tee shirts! HAHAHA!   I don't normally organize my lures like that. I was baiting for the manther and figured a giant shiny clump would be more attractive...  Guess it worked

390865,solopaddler,2009-10-07 02:27:00,8605,"  See? Someone else knows the ways of the manther! Twinkies, Ho Ho's, Ding Dongs....whatever, manthers love 'em all.   Beware the FUPA!!"
390868,tibbs,2009-10-07 02:30:00,650,I'd be careful... you don't want to mess with the hulk.
390874,ChrisK,2009-10-07 02:36:00,2772," Hey,that manther looks awfully familiar ??? "
390876,BillM,2009-10-07 02:46:00,17367, I'm about 5 seconds away from pissing my pants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Drive fast!  Less time on highway!
390878,solopaddler,2009-10-07 02:50:00,8605," AHAHAHAHA!  Me too man, I'm making myself laugh.  I think a road trip is in order."
390882,BillM,2009-10-07 02:59:00,17367,"I think you are correct..  It's been way to long.  Let's just make sure we don't decimate any rivers or streams.   Cause ya know, you are well know for that."
