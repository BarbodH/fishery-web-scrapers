848661,mukluk,2014-04-18 21:12:00,196,"Noticed a problem getting through to the General Discussion page last night.  Started blaming myself right away.   Now what button did I mistakenly  press to cause this?   Home Depot ad kept popping up.   Never gonna shop there again if this doesn""t clear up.  Ok now."
