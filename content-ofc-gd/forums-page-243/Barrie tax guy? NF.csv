He did the taxes for my father's global business and now does them for my girlfriend and I. You would have to mail him your stuff as he resides around Windsor Ontario but he is very good. I am in full commission sales so I need a good tax guy and I would recommend him to anyone! PM me if your interested, I too live in Barrie but would rather mail to this guy then find someone closer."
