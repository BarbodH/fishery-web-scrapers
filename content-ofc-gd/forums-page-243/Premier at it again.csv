848225,Headhunter,2014-04-16 12:44:00,5703,"  That said, I have to wonder what the current state of ""E-Health"" is and futhermore, how much more $$$$ we have poured into it, with still nothing to show. I guess the first billion spent was a test to see how much more they can actually spend. HH"
848230,Big Cliff,2014-04-16 12:50:00,6899,  I guess the first billion spent was a test to see how much more they can actually spend. HH Starting to sound more and more like the long gun registry!
848237,LeXXington,2014-04-16 13:55:00,1928,"Every government from the dawn of democracy has always found way to grow the government.  When you get enough people living off the government dole there are bound to vote to keep what they have.  Get more people working and voting for the government you hit a critical movement.  We, the people who pay the bills are screwed!  Greece anyone?"
848245,Headhunter,2014-04-16 14:45:00,5703,"  Our fabulous Ontario Gov has been dealing with E-Health since Smitherman was Minister of Health. Over a billion into it, they decided that perhaps the path they chose wasn't the correct one to take and a ""re-write"" was in order. I don't know what the current price tag is at, but I bet we are close to another billion with no tangible results. Couple that with the gas plant fiasco and there's close to three billion evaporated. As I have said before, we don't seem to have a ""money shortage"" to fund projects; we seem to have a spending problem. Wait until we start to see the 40% increase in natural gas costs as well as the 50% hydro costs we will be absorbing... the whole time we are selling hydro at a loss or worse yet, being charged by other jurisdictions just to take away our access. Yes, it's time for drastic change... HH"
848250,lew,2014-04-16 14:56:00,12766,"  Wait until we start to see the 40% increase in natural gas costs  Last summer I payed somewhere around $0.75 per litre for propane, then as the temps dropped the prices rose and I paid $1.10 by January and then they started to drop and last week I paid $0.79  Now that the NG suppliers have received the go ahead to raise prices 40% I imagine it's only a matter of time before propane sky rockets again and stays high."
848294,jimmer,2014-04-16 18:25:00,2730,"bigugli : she is the Premier, one that's in hot water. The leader of our province is supposed to have some brains (LOL). She should have stopped the appointment in its tracks, because of the optics. I'm also very aware that it's who you know that gets the jobs. Most of us have experience with that, but when it's a high profile position with a government organization that should be shelved, that's another thing."

848299,Thrilla,2014-04-16 18:42:00,164,Everytime I see her or hear her name I cringe
848306,woodenboater,2014-04-16 19:00:00,2277,"I think Wynne was win a no win situation here. Derail the appointment and she'd be accused of meddling in the board's affairs, do nothing and she gets hammered regardless.  I think there are bigger issues to worry about and this is small fish tbh. think life will be better under howath or hudak ? pleaseâ€¦.  all people can do is make sure she's aware that a fire is lit under her and anything untoward and she's golfing."
848307,davey buoy,2014-04-16 19:05:00,5505," Last summer I payed somewhere around $0.75 per litre for propane, then as the temps dropped the prices rose and I paid $1.10 by January and then they started to drop and last week I paid $0.79  Now that the NG suppliers have received the go ahead to raise prices 40% I imagine it's only a matter of time before propane sky rockets again and stays high. Maybe another tank and fill now may be a good idea? :)If I remember correctly,the rental of the extra may not work."
848310,Dara,2014-04-16 19:20:00,3052,"Good question? They all lie to us and not one of them seems to know what it is like to live in the real world! I tried to fight back once and voted for Bob Rae back when he was NDP, we all know how that ended. I believe in getting out there and voting but when all you have to choose from is the best liar.......   Things are not going to change until there is accountability and saddly I don't see that happening in my lifetime!  So now back to the question; who do you vote for and why?   Unless you were a government worker and subjected to Rae days...ie, an unpaid day off for all government workers...Bob didn't do all that bad a job in tough times...wasn't it the liberals that left him  with a pile of debt back then too  edit...maybe not...gotta read back a few years, seems he cause a bunch of debt during recession  I guess we all gotta go wit Hudak"
848312,jimmer,2014-04-16 19:31:00,2730,"I don't really trust any of them, which makes it tough to vote. bigugli - private sector, I have a choice of where my money goes. Public sector not so much. My rhino party never got in. LOL So, unfortunately there will be a double standard if the government operates in a transparent fashion."
848346,Twocoda,2014-04-16 22:11:00,4130,we have allowed no accountability from our elected officials. from city polictics to federal.. pretty sad when folks have died for freedoms and then this. she is sueing Hudak for libel to the tune of 2 million...we all should be sueing her and her party for fraud CLASS ACTION put our tax dollars working for us for a change
848350,Big Cliff,2014-04-16 23:11:00,6899,"That might be one heck of a good idea except the only winners would be the lawyers. If we sue her and her party and we win, where do you think the money is going to come from to pay us? Trust me they will find a way to make us pay it!  Her suit against Hudack is a total farce anyway IMHO, she knows that by the time anything legal comes from it the election will be history.  They all lie and when they do get caught they just tell new lies! Corruption in politics in Canada is alive and well!"
848351,Twocoda,2014-04-16 23:16:00,4130,instead of doing nothing and letting them get away with time and time again ...it will cost a bit to pay layers to represent us ...but i would rather see the money go to our long term benefit than to a political parties benefit to purchase seats ....Lock her up and the guilty jerk before her...these people belong behind bars
848357,Big Cliff,2014-04-16 23:39:00,6899,"Well, I agree with you totally about the ""lock em up"" part of it but we would have to build new jails if we locked up all the corrupt, lying politicians!  Actually, that alone might create quite a few new well paying jobs and the billions of $ wasted (squandered is probably a better word) that we would save would easily pay for it. There might even be enough of a surplus to reduce our taxes.  I know, I know, wishful thinking!"
848359,moxie,2014-04-16 23:53:00,1566,Bill Carroll of Talk 640 is waging a War against Wynne and recruiting people from across the social medias. So hop on your Faceplant and/or Twitter and instead of posting pics of the dump or meal of the day or other nonsensical stuff that no one really cares about other than the one that laid it out there get behind something that will get some real and important attention.  I have my own personal war to wage with these idiots and wouldn't want anyone within range to get hit with any scat should it hit the fan. Besides I'm almost certain that for but a few I'd be left hanging in the wind if I needed the help of many to back me up.
848752,moxie,2014-04-19 02:30:00,1566,Man it got quiet in here. Exactly as I figured.

848029,jimmer,2014-04-15 15:33:00,2730,So Premier Wynne thinks it's a good idea to appoint her brother-in-law as the interim eHealth boss. When does it stop? Are these people living in the real world? What arrogance. They never cease to amaze me.
848030,misfish,2014-04-15 15:38:00,29133,It works for the Ford Brothers.

They were voted in,Wynnes brother in law from what I hear was just appointed the job??.Must be nice to have the power to put whoever you feel ,either family or friend?.I can't grasp how they can do this?.Most places of employment especially now ,will not allow any family or friends.Unlike the old days."
848093,Sinker,2014-04-15 20:20:00,8692,Its all of us that are allowing this to happen.  I think its high time we knock some heads. This is Bull!  S.

848113,moxie,2014-04-15 23:01:00,1566,"I don't mind the brother in law thing but come out ahead of it instead of allowing the optics to write the narrative. A continuation of the flagrant disregard for you, me and the rest of us. A big ole' screw you with a middle finger salute to the blood, sweat and tears they take from us day in and day out and just throw away to their friends and others lined up on that kickback convoy that has followed this group of thieves around for the last decade.  Tim Hudak might have spoken out of term but I would dare her to take any action on any of the nasty E-mails I have and keep sending to her and a couple of her incompetent ministers week in and week out. I'd love for her to make a martyr of me. I double dare her in fact.  I wonder how that would go over with my fellow Ontarians. I wonder if they would stand behind a sacrificial lamb, show some spine and finally show the size of cahones needed to make an example of this group and put future politicos with a similar aspiration to lead what is expected.....no,  demanded of them on notice if they choose to be honoured enough to lead us, the people.  Until then we continue to read the headlines, listen to sound bytes and banter back and forth while they figure out how to retain power so they can continue getting away with the utter destruction of our province. The campaign promises made to us with our own money drive me crazy.  We don't even flinch. Why does this happen? Are sports, selfies and you tube vids more important than our future? If so that is a damn shame. Opprtunities lost folks.  I bet they're having a laugh at our expense while huddled around a campfire that is kept lit by them throwing our hard earned money onto it.  Come get me Kathleen. Bet you mine are bigger than yours. Not by much but still bigger.   Edited cause I simply lose my mind when I write about these dogs!!!!!!!!"
848132,Oggie,2014-04-15 23:49:00,588,I can't believe she would do that when she's weeks away from an election. She obviously knows she won't even win a minority. My problem is who do you vote for? I can't stand any of them.

I can't stand any of them. I feel your pain but its the action that speaks volumes. Utter decimation of this party is necessary along with a continued onslaught when the new sheriff in town wanders off the path set out for them by ""US"". A mass rally when they get out of hand wouldn't hurt either. We have the ultimate power. We just have to demonstrate our willingness to use it. All depends on who we want to blame when our kids ask us why things are the way they are. We giveth and we can taketh away."

848144,crappieperchhunter,2014-04-16 00:23:00,2582,OK I'll play the devil's advocate. She gets friends or family members a job. Big deal it happens everyday. I'm betting there's not many out there who haven't  done the same for there friends or family when they can.  My second job out of school 30+ years ago I was hired by my best buddies older brother. I started out higher in a company ahead of people who had put in time there because I was a family friend and they knew I was capable. I worked my butt off to prove that a good choice was made.  Was it fair to others..perhaps not. But at the end of the day it was a good business choice.  Trust me I'm not sticking up for any politicians. I don't follow politics...hell I don't even vote. Just saying that many in the same position would do the same thing.  Now if it was a poor choice and the person is grossly under qualified...then I guess we just round up the posse and go hang them all
848165,Oggie,2014-04-16 01:49:00,588,Private sector isn't funded by our tax dollars so how they hire is up to the company. Public sector is/should be held to a higher standard. You don't tender purchases in private sector but you're supposed to in the public sector. Thing must be more transparent and accountable.
848169,manitoubass2,2014-04-16 02:02:00,11391,"Lol, where is billm telling you all to get out the tinfoil hats? This stuff is so rediculous now it's not even shocking, just normal. Nothing to see here, move on."

The board of directors at eHealth appointed him to the *interim* position until they find a new head. So while the optics aren't that great, I'm not going to lynch Wynne over this one. She was arms length from what I can see. Blame the board but I guess since it's an interim position, they probably wanted someone who knew the lay of the land. ymmv"
848175,moxie,2014-04-16 02:11:00,1566,Time to revolt and overthrow the government!!! Wish it were that easy Joey. Peoples' bellies are full at the moment. We'll see how they feel when they start to experience hunger pains. By then it might be too late and of little consequence to initiate change.
