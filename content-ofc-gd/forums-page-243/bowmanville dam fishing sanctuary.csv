Nice to see the ladder is complete, but sad to see that the fish are too stupid and are jumping on the other side of the damn  I also noticed that the marker line hanging over the creek advising of the no fishing line seems much much closer to the dam this year.  The sign said ""no fishing within 25 yards of the dam""  while the other sign (which I think are the signs from last year) said no fishing within 120 meters of the dam.  So did they change the regulations on this thing???"
848660,porkpie,2014-04-18 21:03:00,2521,"Likely changed to reflect similar regulations at other dams.  There is an active fishway now, so theoretically no need for an extended sanctuary.  Don't worry, the trout will eventually figure it out!"
848662,redpearl99,2014-04-18 21:18:00,259,that's terrible.... so snaggers will essentially be fishing the boarder of the dam on opener
848771,Twocoda,2014-04-19 04:47:00,4130,anybody have any pics of the new dam?
848841,Garnet,2014-04-19 16:35:00,2056,The town has a bylaw 120 meters above and below Goodyear Dam. Think it was for construction but it's still on the books. I know Mitch is charging people so maybe my taxes are going down.
