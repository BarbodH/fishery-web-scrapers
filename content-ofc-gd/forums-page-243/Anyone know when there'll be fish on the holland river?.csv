848699,BowSlayer101,2014-04-18 23:52:00,296,"the crappies are in but not in the spots where everyone fishes for them but thats kinda obvious, they are in small quantities, in some spots they are in larger quantities but up river from where the crowds are. The dogfish are in, in some spots as well if you're into that, i myself will be slaying the crappies in the trent/talbot are tomm."
