848508,aplumma,2014-04-17 20:34:00,6896,Once the water is drawn from the reservoir it is then pumped into a tower and as it passes thru the pump a product called Chloramin is aerated/injected into the water. All of the filtration is done when it is pumped into the reservoir. This action was done just to placate the people and head off a scandal or Bull lawsuit.   Art

848569,aplumma,2014-04-18 11:55:00,6896,Never mind what is in the water if you really want to see YUCK it is as close as the money in your pocket or the ice machine at any restaurant. Thankfully the human body can fight off most of the stuff you are bombarded with in an average day. We humans on the cellular level are amazing with what our bodies do in the background of our lives.  Art
