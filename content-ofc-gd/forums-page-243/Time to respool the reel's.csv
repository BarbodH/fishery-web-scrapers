848820,tender52,2014-04-19 14:19:00,270,"This has probably been on here before. flurocarbon or mono? Another question is can I fill a spool with fluro, as you would mono? I fish everything under the sun from Bass, Pike, Perch Crappy, eyes, you name it. My biggest question would be does fluro last longer than mono? My stuff takes a real beating year round.  Thanks all  Colin"
848824,BillM,2014-04-19 14:38:00,17367,I'd be putting braid on over flouro and mono to be honest.   6lb Nano or 6lb Fireline will work for anything.
848826,NANUK,2014-04-19 15:03:00,797," The only mono goes on my downrigger reels, I use braid on almost all other reels, sometime with a floro leader,"
848827,kickingfrog,2014-04-19 15:03:00,8333,Same here for a superline. Braid on baitcasters and some spinning. Nanofil or fireline on spinning. If/as needed I then use mono or flouro tippets.  For me that gives me the versatility I need/want.
848828,BowSlayer101,2014-04-19 15:07:00,296,"power pro braid and a fluro leader for the smaller fish just fluro, can't remember the brand but i think its some kind of trilene."
848833,davey buoy,2014-04-19 15:45:00,5505,I agree also with braid. Power pro 8/30 in moss green works well for baitcasters and spinning imo.
848847,Bernie,2014-04-19 16:51:00,3190,After years of using Fireline using a rod with mono is like fishing with a rubber band. No line memory and long casting ability is also a key factor.

848852,mattaw,2014-04-19 17:29:00,162,"Braid for almost everything, different diameters from 20-50 pound test depending on what I'm fishing. I will match a floro leader in most cases for the visability factor. The only case where I use pure floro is ultra finesse and on my cranking reel as floro sinks a bit better than braid."
848856,Meegs,2014-04-19 17:51:00,249,"Power pro slick 8...  I dont own a reel with only mono or floro anymore, except for.my float reels."
848862,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-19 19:21:00,540,Braid and floro leader
848884,solopaddler,2014-04-19 21:25:00,8605,"For those that like braid try the moss green Power Pro in 4 or 5lb test for lighter applications. It's so thin it's amazing. I use it primarily jigging for walleye as well as casting for trout in small streams and inland lakes. Most often I don't even bother with a fluoro leader, just tie direct."
848885,Dan668,2014-04-19 21:28:00,1120,"Fluoro for everything but topwater, frogs, jig fishing heavy cover. Use braid for those techniques."
848966,tender52,2014-04-20 14:31:00,270,"Thanks all.  Ive benn using mono all my life.  A friend said to switch months back, (early fall) then while watching fish T.V yesterday, they were promoting the suffix fluro and got me to thinking.  Thanks again"
848968,Bernie,2014-04-20 14:35:00,3190,With all the paid promoting they do on fishing shows I don't believe a word of it.  
848975,kickingfrog,2014-04-20 15:04:00,8333,Most of us had used mono all of our lives as well. Then we tried a superline.
