848338,Twocoda,2014-04-16 21:21:00,4130,i was in the trailer park yesterday and there were bows swimming around the campfire pits...lol..at the top of the chute on the highside there is one row of the grate exposed and inside the ladder is a straight flow....there is no indication inside that it is a ladder at all....i have pictures of Mill Dam from yesterday completely submerged and not even registering a ripple on the surface of the river ..water level is at the bottom of the Paisley bridge...Sauble River looks like the Saugeen's normal appearance....
