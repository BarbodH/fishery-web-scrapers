Would be very interested in communicating with anyone who knows or lives in the area, especially North Frontenac. Looking to do some ice-out trout fishing this year, north of Highway 7 and looking for a roads/lakes report given the flooding and late breakup this year.  Also looking for a spot with some good pike for May.  In my immediate area, lakes are about 2 feet higher than normal, with record water levels dating back to the 1970s.  Roy"
