848767,Twocoda,2014-04-19 04:30:00,4130,A friend captured these images and thought the fish was a trout...most definitely not ...but if i was to guess...maybe a mooneye? what do you guys think ??? because im sure as heck am not certain  
848768,Twocoda,2014-04-19 04:32:00,4130,"If i knew how to edit the title i would fix the word ""friend""...lol..."
848769,Joey,2014-04-19 04:38:00,9122,"Click on edit, then click 'use full editor' and you can change the title.  Not sure what fish it is, but great photos"
848772,Twocoda,2014-04-19 04:50:00,4130,Thanks Joey
848775,misfish,2014-04-19 08:23:00,29133,Horse head sucker.  Nice shot
848779,Roy,2014-04-19 08:53:00,13728,Nice pics. Definitely not a sucker....most likely a mooneye.
848782,Jon,2014-04-19 10:39:00,209,Tough to tell. Mooneye or Gizzard Shad.  Jon
848783,solopaddler,2014-04-19 11:25:00,8605,Tough to tell. Mooneye or Gizzard Shad.  Jon  Pretty positive it's a shad.
848784,Roy,2014-04-19 11:33:00,13728,"Yup, hadn't even considered shad but that's even more likely. The anal fin is a giveaway for either unless I'm missing something."
848785,Christopheraaron,2014-04-19 11:36:00,3525,Atlantic!  Nice shots.
848793,kickingfrog,2014-04-19 12:10:00,8333,I say shad as well.
848801,dave524,2014-04-19 12:29:00,4508,"Too big for a mooneye, unless they get bigger than the ones we used to get flyfishing in the Grand or that is a very small Osprey. Shad sounds good. Where are these pictures taken??? that would go a long ways to figuring it out."
848812,Twocoda,2014-04-19 13:37:00,4130,pictures were taken at the Bluffers Park  the Osprey was her target to capture....the fish is a bonus! ...Thanks guys..I hadnt considered a Shad either...I was stuck with goldeye and mooneye
848813,fishing,2014-04-19 13:39:00,167,"Shad (big, wide body), not trout, not mooneye (small, narrow body)."
848871,PikeMolester,2014-04-19 20:11:00,428,pretty sure its a shad as well
848905,OhioFisherman,2014-04-19 22:54:00,6623,A shad was my first thought too.
848908,big guy,2014-04-19 23:29:00,414,Post spawn largemouth bass
848918,gino,2014-04-20 00:59:00,400,Asian   carp
848919,Terry,2014-04-20 01:02:00,14456,"well, it's not simcoe herring..cause he would have released it"
