T'was a pretty decent day out with tropical temps this morn.    Got the bulk of my dock building lumber onsite, now I just need the hardware and time to get it all assembled. But that will have to wait for the thaw as there is still 3+ feet of snow in the bush.    I spent about an hour packing in the trail to the site from the ice road. I still managed to get stuck pretty good at the shoreline as the snow was about 8"" of wet snow on top of 2 feet of corn snow.  â€‹I was going to head out tomorrow and do some lumber-jacking but I think I'll wait for the snow to melt first."

849086,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-21 01:19:00,10439,Me neither!!!! Been a loooooooong winter up here with way to many -40 days. Only got out ice fishing twice this winter. Of course I was in Florida for 7 of the warmest weeks of the season.
