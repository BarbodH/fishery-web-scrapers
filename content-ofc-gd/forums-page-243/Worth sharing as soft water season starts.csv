I use this as a word of caution when I  go out, especially since I met Dave and chatted with him personally about the incident.  The author of this is an experienced great lakes fisherman and author.  You can tell by his face that these events are still clear as a bell in his mind and experience.  ""I never go out without an inflatable pfd anymore Rick -and everyone on my boat has to wear pfds"" An inflatable is on my list, as I hate wearing a pfd - but I'll put up with it in the meantime  http://www.glangler.com/_blog/Great_Lakes_Angler/post/MULL%27s_BLOG_Stupid,_Adrift_and_Thanking_God_for_a_Coleman_Cooler/"

In warm weather it can make all the difference.  In foul shoulder season weather, it may save you if your picked up quickly, or at the very least will make your recovery easier.  I forget I'm even wearing it these days."

I told my partner for the day to make sure he brought his pfd, and he just laughed at me. We fished only a couple hundred yards from camp, and started smashing crappie right away. I hear a boat and called it out, MNR lol. Sure enough it was. Pleasant folks but one of them tried stinging me on my outdoors card for absolutely no reason lol, just silly. But my buddy got a hefty fine for not having his pfd. $350 if i remember correctly. Anyhow, there life saving abilities make them a must have. And if ya dont have em it can easily cost you your life, or $350 dollars"
848617,grt1,2014-04-18 16:50:00,638,i always wear my inflateable vest and when I change locations I put my regular life jacket on over it. saves forgetting to put the inflateable on when I stop.
