848168,stasbrute,2014-04-16 01:53:00,206,"Hello folks, I am just lookin to pick your brains, I would like to attach some seats to my aluminum benches. I would like the seats to be removable, any suggestions on what type of bracket works well, and any installation tips out there .....   Thank you  Greg"
848172,porkpie,2014-04-16 02:09:00,2521,"Canadian tire sells an excellent clamp on seat mount designed for bench seats. They are removable with wing nuts and lock washers.  They include a seat swivel, are all metal and run $35. Just bolt on your seat and clamp it on, good to go!   Better than the half plastic ones at BPS for $29.99"

848202,wormdunker,2014-04-16 06:46:00,1711,I have the same unit Mike is showing.  They work very well in my 14' Lund.  Just be sure of your location before boring a hole in the existing bench seat in your boat.
848256,big guy,2014-04-16 15:32:00,414,"Canadian Tire sell a seat bracket that screws on to the seat and allows a swivel to slide into it, making them removable for storage, cleaning etc. I tried to find a picture/link of them, but couldn't. I have them installed on my boat and they are great, very easy to install, easy to take off when needed and extremely durable. They are made of black ABS, the swivel on the bottom of the seat slides in and locks into the base. They weren't expensive either, I would highly recommend them."
848383,trevy727,2014-04-17 01:29:00,351,I have a pair of these I can sell you for $35 if you're interested. I'm in guelph
848395,pidge,2014-04-17 03:41:00,438,"I run the clamp style on my Jon Boat. Bought at BassPro last year. Wasn't to expensive, but the seats can be. I went the cheapes route and I'm happy. There are 4 sheet metal screws that need to be drilled in to hold these little lip bracket things that hold the clamp from popping out when you lean back. This is what it looks like outta the box.  http://www.ebay.com/bhp/jon-boat-seats  Works well and I'm happy."
848491,jimmer,2014-04-17 19:08:00,2730,I like this system out of all the ones I have seen for small boats. I bought this at Robinson Marine in Lindsay. I'm sure you could order through the mail with them.
848659,stasbrute,2014-04-18 20:51:00,206,"some good ideas there people, thank you for the help"
848993,pidge,2014-04-20 16:00:00,438,"Hey Grog, I was over to basspro yesterday and they've got the one I linked in the previous post on sale for 29.00. Thought you'd like to know."
