When he had the (2001) 90 4 stroke, it was sitting on the 2nd hole from the top.. Just curious ? is his newer 115 sitting too high ??  Are the hole patterns not the same ??  We took it out and the 115 hp ran slower that his 90 hp did ??Any help would be much appreciated..Tiz"

849124,doubleheader,2014-04-21 13:34:00,497,"Best way to tell is to plane the boat and trim the motor. Does it blow out excessively when turning? On the other hand, are you creating excess drag with the vent plate?"
849208,tizfun,2014-04-21 21:45:00,292,"Thanks for all the tips everyone...  Waiting to take it out again, this time he's got a 17 pitch 4 blade Trophy and a 21 pitch Laser II that we're going to try... The prop that he got with the motor was a Michigan Wheel 19 pitch and the blades seem to be so thick compared to the SST's..  The cavitation plate it about 1/2 higher that the bottom of the boat... So it looks to be installed correctly.  Thanks again,"
