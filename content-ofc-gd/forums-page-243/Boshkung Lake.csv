848849,SWOrange,2014-04-19 16:54:00,6,"Hi folks,  Will be up on Boshkung Lake (just north of Minden) mid-July, just wondering if anyone can give me a little direction on this lake? It is part of a 3 lake chain apparently, so perhaps some of the adjoining lakes are worthwhile?  My reading seems to point to LMB, SMB and lakers. Anyone know if there is decent pike fishing?  I've never personally had much luck for lakers, but haven't really chased them much. I know by July they will likely be deep? Any advice for lakers?  Thanks for any help you guys can give me!"
