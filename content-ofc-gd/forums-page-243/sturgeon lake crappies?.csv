848431,super dave,2014-04-17 13:06:00,323,Anyone know if sturgeon lake has a decent crappie population?   I just got a new yak and I'm dying to try it out.  I've never targeted crappies before but it's the only thing open now in the lake. Thanks
848432,Sinker,2014-04-17 13:24:00,8692,pigeon and scugog are better.  S.
848438,Garfisher,2014-04-17 13:47:00,229,"Sturgeon has a real good population of crappies (mind it they seem to disappear in the winter haha). Got lots of 10-13"" crappie in the nets (trap netting with Fleming College), so you shouldn't be disappointed when you do find them"
848445,super dave,2014-04-17 14:13:00,323,Thanks.  Would it be too early this weekend?

Those other lakes can get crazy trying to get on one of the spots. You haven't tried crappie fishing on Sturgeon Lake then. There are some but the few spots that they do seem to concentrate in are fished very heavly. One spot that comes to mind; it is not unusual to see up to 25-30 boats fishing a small bay. It gets bad enough at times that you could almost walk across them and tempers start to get out of hand. The other thing is that we seem to have a population of fishermen that take everything they catch so it is unusual to find anything of a decent size.
