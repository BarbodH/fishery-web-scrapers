849015,Raycaster,2014-04-20 17:52:00,528,"I have it running pretty smooth from my pc so I went and ordered a unit from gboxcanada for downstairs without a pc.  The $129 price jumped to $139 when I ordered, the shipping added $20 and the taxes rounded it out to $180!!!.  I ordered on Tuesday and received confirmation 2 days later. Its still in transit in the maritimes due to my bad timing (Easter holidays).  $20 shipping for over approx 10 days shipping of a small parcel seems pretty high. The $20 UPS or something better than Canada Post 10 day expedited shipping might had been more in line.  My one question that I don't seem to get an answer with xbmc is the p2p. Is this just a glorified streaming torrent app? Is the cache of the movie I watch being uploaded to others?  Just a follow up...  Package arrived Tuesday and I have been playing with it big time! Unfortunately I am going to return it as I was really expecting more. I have xbmc installed on a pc and tablet and it works great but the Android box seems very under powered and handicapped without a mouse or touch screen. It took almost an hour to enter in my login information for Netflix as the remote and cursor would cancel the input so I finally had to plug a keyboard in. Then the unit wouldn't allow the shift key on the keyboard for ""@"" so I did 1/2 with keyboard and 1/2 with remote cursor. A lot of the applications had these problems of input which probably could of been prevented with another $$$ remote. Also had a ton of problems viewing any movies where the PC version had no problems. I thought the GBox with OTA updates would have the latest respository info etc. but really seemed slow.  The GBox may be a great unit but just not for my family. Unfairly I wanted it to be super user friendly for the wife/kids but it's input killed that right away. I unfairly hoped for more of a ""AppleTV"" environment having easy control and access to Netflix and Slingplayer along with xbmc."

It does take some getting used too and the broken links can be a PIA but for a 100 bucks it will pay for it`s self in no time just in movie rental and download fee savings.

The driod box has to be constantly left on for updating, cause if you dont it has to update when you turn it on and is completely useless when updating.

848108,206,2014-04-15 22:22:00,563,"I can see this being short lived like FTA lol.  Here is the latest post from XBMC facebook page  There is a growing (and worrying) misconception caused by some websites and people who sell HTPC devices with XBMC pre-installed. These often contain add-ons from we which we would like to clearly distance ourselves, and for which we will not offer support of any kind. We will not call these add-ons by name.However if it all seems to be good to be true like watching content (movies and tvshows) for free, you should start asking yourself if this can still be considered legal. In some countries it can be considered clearly illegal.It a regretful development that in our eyes, the most awesome media centre there is, is clouded by such a development. These few people are giving and spreading a misconception of what XBMC is and stands for, and are giving it a bad name. We would like to remind everyone that XBMC should be seen as a media centre platform for which you must provide your own media obtained through a legally obtained manor, PVR or by using add-ons which do not clearly violate copyright laws.Hopefully we can break this tide and restore and improve our good name that we worked so hard for. As always the only and official news and XBMC versions can be found at from http://xbmc.org/about/ Please help us and spread the word of the true purpose of XBMC. Thank you."

844784,Gerritt,2014-04-01 02:02:00,6129,"What raf says.... I will add it also depends on the demand you upstream provider is experiencing.  I have 14mbps here and stream hd with zero issues using the box I purchased.  I don't want to get into what box is better, what website is better what seller is better nonsense, what I can say for fact is the unit I picked up works. Plain and simple. And you don't have to be a computer nerd to use it. Just plug In and go. Any updates required are pushed OTA. Provided by where I purchased it from..... For now....in my experience these companies don't last forever, I felt better to own a unit I control, should a company go teats up. I am not left with a brick.  For those of you considering this... Use it to augment your current service. Until you decide it is right for you. And either cancel your service or lower your cost by going with basic service... Up to you.  Here in my house we watch first run movies, series (including ones from netflix exclusive ones for free, however not broadcast from Netflix)and documentaries, fishing shows.... This list goes on and on. If you are a netflix subscriber you can use it on your box as well.  I have had a bunch of pms asking me if a computer is needed. The answer is NO! The box you purchase is the computer, it runs on android, so if you can use your cellphone you can use this... It is just another app  Go to YouTube, and search gbox or xbmc you will see for yourself just how simple this system is to use.  One last thing to say in this thread...  Would you be willing to pay a monthly fee for something you own outright? A car? A boat? Sounds like a bill for something you already bought paid for and own. Just for the privilege of using the item you own? The whole idea is to eliminate bills!  Not me. I bought what works, and free support from a trust worthy company ( for however long they are around like most others)  No matter what u decide to do.... It is a great way to stop the big three machine.  Good luck and if u have any questions pm me.  G"

844801,Old Ironmaker,2014-04-01 07:31:00,8243,"I know more now concerning the options for TV signal vs. Ma Bell and Mr. Rogers. Early in my life I would be afraid to ask a question occasionally in case I was supposed to already know the answer to. I came up through the ranks and missed 4 years or so of engineering. Now I couldn't care less. I have a few question for you guys that only a very simple basic knowledge PC user would ask. Never too old to learn, right Big Cliff? I am somewhat confused as well and stopped counting the number of options for service at 6.  Some simple questions for some of you if you will please.  What is ""android box fully rooted"" to mean?  ""Buying it unlocked""?  What is meant by download/upload?  What is Bandwidth and why is it important?  How is Bandwidth and live stream related?  Live stream is live TV? Like a game on TV is broadcast live in real time?  That's it for now, from Page 1, thanks.  I have watched a few shows I missed on the internet through the network i.e. History Channel, get 1/2 way through and a tiny circle appears and the video dies, need to start from the beginning, it drives me nuts. If this can happen with these boxes forget it I'll pay my 70 bucks for Bell Expressive, which I hate paying but works even through some bad storms here on Lake Erie shoreline. I watch only HD channels, again it's worth the goof tax to Bell for HD if not much HD on these boxes."
844804,big guy,2014-04-01 11:02:00,414,"I should be able to help here.  Android is essentially the operating system the box has installed in it, like windows on a computer. Fully rooted i believe means that's it all set up, the best apps are already loaded on to it from the company when you buy it so you can just plug it in and use it.  I believe unlocked is related to my last sentence above, I think.  Download/upload is the speed at which you can download content from the web, according to the service you have. Like i said above we have 5Mbps (5000 Kbps) download speed and we can put stuff out on the Net at 800 Kbps. The faster the speed the faster you can receive content, images, movies. Thus my concern about live tv being choppy, starting and stopping when viewing it.  Bandwidth is related to the above but also how much your package from your provider allows you to download per month before it starts to cost you extra for exceeding that limit. We pay a little extra per month to be able to download an unlimited amount of content.  Bandwidth and live stream i basically covered 2 paragraphs above.  Live streaming is yes, watching something as it's happening live, like HNIC on Saturday.  I like the idea Gerritt had about using the Gbox to watch movies and older shows etc, as they won't be streamed live, then keeping a basic package from bell that will allow us to watch HD channels and live sporting events. It's probably the way we will go until our download speed improves out here in the country.  Thanks to all for the info, great thread."

844911,Consigliere,2014-04-01 20:12:00,121,"People interested in this should look at Roku.  Best device I have used for streaming.  I've used it to cut the cord at my house.  Best thing is live sports is completely do-able and full HD quality for about $100 per season per sport.  In fact, some of the services are better than paying for the Gamecenter/Super Sports packages because you have full DVR capability for EVERY game in NBA and NHL.  NFL is also available but requires you to use the official NFL game center package and use a EU DNS service for $200 for the season.  I've gone from $$150 a month to $40 and have access to every game for every sport I watch.  Any shows I want to watch I downloaded to begin with so I continue to do that."

I do have an antenna mounted on my roof pointed at the CN tower for the local channels (I'm in Grand Valley)-- which other than the cost of the antenna, is now free.  if my math is right that's $240 - 10% of your yearly $2400.  our viewing habits may differ so this may not work for you."

Anyway he got me a great deal on the new long range wifi modem the Rogers nextbox pvr free for 6 months for both no contract. All just to switch from bell. So needless to say in 5 months time I will cut back to basic cable and keep the internet package. XBMC is awesome! Found an amazing HD TSN feed for tonights game.."

845508,lookinforwalleye,2014-04-04 04:24:00,4399,When I signed with Rogers they told me they would give me 100 $ rebate...never did they lied...they said they would give me 2 boxes free for 3 years...now they tell me  sorry that deal is now 12 months...they lied...their equipment is junk constantly freezing and rebooting...they are a rotten company and they treat the customer like they are doing them a favour!  Rogers are criminals it's as simple as that...

844537,Raf,2014-03-31 00:48:00,3495,"Ow, thanks.  definately not an option if you are rural and have no access to cable / dsl.  if you do have either however, there are plenty of package especially from third party resellers that have large enough bandwidth limits."

Then they asked me to go to receiver #1 and tell them what the code was, I did and within seconds it started working again. Same thing with receivers 2 and 3. When it came time to do receiver 4 and 5 I explained that they weren't at this location and that is when the crap hit the fan so to speak.  Oh, and mine weren't plugged in to the phone line either."

The issue is the low monthly bandwidth caps you have .   Video, especially HD, eats up a lot of data."
844632,tb4me,2014-03-31 16:23:00,3295,XBMC s the way to go. Future tv is better if you dont like to mess around constantly. You just simply turn it on and enjoy. Future tv also has child locks that work well.. Almost too well. its a pain to have to enter the code. There is one thing with any XBMC box or even future TV one box per TV. So if you have 3 tv's you will need 3 future tv subscriptions or 3 android boxes. Unless you dont mind moving your computer or andriod box to different tv's.

If I went with a internet system could I still get hockey i.e. all the Habs and Leaf games? And the other shows I like....Pawn Stars...Ice Pilots... Walking Dead etc?  If anybody could shed some light on that please!!!  you're in orangeville right? get an HD antenna and point it at the cn tower, there's your CBC HNIC broadcasts along with anything else the Toronto stations broadcast.  If you want all NHL games, you will need NHL Gamecenter subscription, you will also need a service ($1.99 / month to get around the local blackouts).  Mine is $99 / season that's still cheaper than basic cable when you break it down by month.  Walking Dead is on netflix, The other shows are available via XBMC plugins.  You won't get the shows the day they are aired but if you're ok with a day (or a few hours) later, then no issue.  even basic cable was like $70+ / month with box rental for us, that's $840 a year!  By comparison, my expenses for TV are $99 / year for game center + 8.99 / month (netflix) + 1.99 / month blackout service."

Its the content that can get you into trouble and from what I have seen there is no such content..Im not going to say what said content is cause I find it disgusting and I cant even say the words. The illegal stuff was FTA and that is long gone now.

844778,Raf,2014-04-01 01:26:00,3495,5mpbs may or may not be enugh for hd.  it is enough for netflix but may not be for nhl gamecenter as they stream at a higher bitrate.  if the tv is the only thing using the internet in your house while watching then maybe but you'd want at least 10 as mentioned for HD.  5 should be more than enough for sd.  we have 25 mbps down here and can watch netflix on two tvs in hd + surf web / play ps3 at the same time without issue.  the lack decent high speed internet in rural areas in canada is really a pet peeve of mine.  it's not like you're 200 miles from civilization either.

I believe that if you buy it unlocked, it's the same: basically no fees. I'm also just getting into using XBMC and I love that as well. Like you said, not perfect, but for the price difference (i.e. xbmc = $0.00) you can't lose.  Another ""secret"" which Rogers & Bell don't want you to know is that the old fashioned antenna is back with a vengeance. I've got one mounted on my house & get about 30 channels from it. Granted, you don't get the ""cable"" channels, but you get all the big ones - CBC, CTV, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, PBS etc... plus if you boost your signal a little you can also get a bunch of US specialty Over-the-Air channels similar to many cable channels, For example, we can't get Treehouse for our kids, but we get ""Qubo"" over the air - just as good, and free.  The other thing that nobody will tell you is that Grandma's old antenna captures a digital signal, which means that it gets you the absolute clearest, highest quality HD signal. Cable and Satellite are poor cousins, as far as HD quality goes. It's truly sparkling.    p.-  p.s. so I got to see every wrinkle on Carlyle's face last night as he prepares to get fired as Leafs coach over the summer... lol!"

I have have alot of trouble with both boxes if you don't leave them on all the time when you fire them up don't expect it to work right away it likes to hog bandwidth to update it's add ons making streaming slow until its is done.
