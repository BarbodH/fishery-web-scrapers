Properties next to windmills devalue significantly.  You have no say in the building of a windmill .... that's whats unfair.  If they put a highway through your property they need to expropriate and compensate. Not so with a windmill.

Those European countries that went all in,  are backing away,  knowing full well that the solar / wind industry cannot sustain itself without the ongoing, heavy subsidies they have been receiving.   The same goes for here in Ontario.   But so far, the lemmings keep re-electing the Ontario Liberals.   $1.1Billion wasted on aborted gas plants!   awe that's ok,  didn't somebody apologize for that,  and besides,  I gotta get to work, and pick up the kids, and then there's the grocery shopping.   Just too busy ... oh, and the subsidies are covered by the Liberal Government""  anyway ... right?!    Oh wait,  that's us ... the TAXPAYER.  Now we are selling lots of our Ontario electricity to the States,  and other jurisdictions, right?   ... so that must be good.   What's that?    We're selling it at a net LOSS?   Why would we do that?    oh never mind,  I'm sure it's all good,   and I'm so busy, busy, busy ... there's that phone again.   Gah!  Vote for a different party than the Ontario Liberals in the next election?   why do that?  They're all the same right ... fibers all of them.   Now the Conservatives are on record as saying they would put a moratorium on further subsidies for solar / gas.   But do we believe them?

The province does not verify these studies. http://www.ottawasun.com/2013/06/18/barrhaven-bridge-delay-for-the-birds  The moral of the story is the Liberal government wants as many wind turbines built as soon and fast as possible regardless of how it effects locals, wildlife, habitat, or hydro rates.    According to this website:  http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2012/02/09/wind-nuclear-infographic/  1 Nuclear plant = 60 year lifespan, always produces power, much less space required (50 acres). **That 50 acre figure must be incorrect as the Bruce nuke plant has 2,300 acres of land.  2077 wind turbines to equal one nuke plant = 20 year lifespan, variable power output, requires backup power generation (gas?), more space required (318 square miles or 203,000 acres)    According to this site:  https://www.wind-watch.org/faq-size.php  Depending on the model, each turbine requires 32 - 78 acres.  The Liberals want more than 6,000 turbines built in Ontario. Using those numbers, there will need to be 192,000 - 468,000 acres available for the turbines.     Unfortunately, many people are still going to vote red because they have been brainwashed into believing the Bull and/or they want pot legalized."

They could alleviate some of their probs (birds, pressure, sound etc) by employing double helix turbine technology. It presents a constant shadow so birds are less likely to be diced and there's no pressure waves from spinning blades.  I'd pick nuclear over hydro for the sake of rivers, lakes etc but I don't know why we couldn't build smaller scale plants vs huge operations.  One concept I've read about that uses green tech is not to store power in batteries but to store the potential energy (think massive air compressors for example) that can be released during demand periods. This would solve several problems that solar and wind have to deal with currently.  That we have to wean ourselves off dino is a given, how we do that and how serious we are about it is the question that needs to be answered."
