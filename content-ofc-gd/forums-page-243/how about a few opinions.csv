Now I need to get some ramps to get the quad in the box.  a neighbour has told me that the folding ramps were useless and to stay away from them. I would like the opinions of those of you out there that have ramps as to what I should get."

848717,vance,2014-04-19 01:16:00,719,"I have 2 kinds of ramps,the 2 piece folding which I hate and the 1 piece trifold which i love.The biggest thing about either is that the ramps will move out from under the tailgate as you load or unload,I solved this by bolting chains on to the ramp and with a quick release attached them to the cargo tie down in the back of the truck and no more worries.  vance"
848718,Sinker,2014-04-19 01:18:00,8692,Whatever ramps you get make sure you strap them to the truck when loading/unloading. The ones I use are one piece.  S.
