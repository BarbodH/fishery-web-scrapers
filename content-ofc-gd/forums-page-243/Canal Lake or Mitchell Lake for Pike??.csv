790419,hungryforpike,2013-06-04 20:04:00,46,"greetings all,  jumped onto Canal lake for the first time 2 weeks ago..we had 25km/h wind and 1ft swells all day. Not a single pike was even seen. I know based on the Pike tournament that occurred in May that they are certainly there..so now we are considering another attempt this weekend. A buddy said to fish Mitchell Lake instead..""has way more pike"" was his comment. So my question is..Canal or Mitchell for pike and has what have been everyone's experiences on either?? Thanks,  HFP"
790422,craigdritchie,2013-06-04 20:29:00,1586,"If I wanted to catch pike, I wouldn't waste a day on either one. LOTS of much better choices, starting with Simcoe and Georgian Bay. Why fish for little dinks when you can have a shot at plenty of legitimate big gators?"
790453,BucktownAngler,2013-06-04 21:56:00,582,you can catch at both. ive seen some big pike/musky sunning themselves at mitchell
790459,Rizzo,2013-06-04 22:18:00,4754,"I would say both Canal and Mitchell are riddled with pike. Personally I would go to mitchell (because its closer to ""kawarthas"" and catch and keep as many as i was allowed)"

Plus with all this wind, i understand both lakes can get nasty quickly. If you can recommend another location that is smaller water, I would love to hear about it.  ""I would say both Canal and Mitchell are riddled with pike. Personally I would go to mitchell (because its closer to ""kawarthas"" and catch and keep as many as i was allowed)""- Good info, I was leaning towards Mitchell previously because of the smaller size as well."
790501,glen,2013-06-05 00:30:00,2641,Yep go get them and good luck.
790534,Dave Bailey,2013-06-05 01:36:00,1641,I've pulled them in on Mitchell.
790581,Rich,2013-06-05 10:47:00,3927,Mitchell.
790602,craigdritchie,2013-06-05 12:53:00,1586," Sorry man. Over the years I've learned that the key to keeping good spots is to not talk about them on the internet. I bust my hump to find nice spots that aren't overcrowded with other people. Why blow it?  Georgian Bay and Simcoe are both big lakes, but the best pike fishing isn't out in the middle. If you do a little research you can find LOTS of places to get out of wind regardless of which direction it blows from. Or try a big river, like the St. Lawrence RIver. It's fairly protected and, being part of the Great Lakes, still loaded with much better pike than you will find in any of the Kawartha lakes."

After some more research based on your comments and some online digging..I think we are going to roll the dice and try Cooks Bay at the foot of Simcoe instead and see how we do."
790782,Rich,2013-06-06 10:23:00,3927,You certainly have a better shot at bigger pike on cooks
790790,Cosmos,2013-06-06 11:30:00,588,"Spent 3 hours yesterday evening trying to catch a pike on Cooks, was dead slow. Saw couple perch following my lure - that was it."
790794,nlpaintballer,2013-06-06 11:50:00,122,"Mitchell, because you can also get to Balsam via the canal. Big pike in both lakes, lot's of them and lots of sheltered water if its windy.  Fished them yesterday, boated 12 pike, largest being a 32"" who nailed a bulldawg. Also taking the pike from these 2 lakes helps the muskie population and slows the spread of pike through the rest of the kawarthas."
790907,cityfisher,2013-06-06 19:35:00,959,MItchelll has lots of smallish pike and some skis too.... Canal is similar .. both have excessive weed growth... Bring your weedless gear !

791242,Rizzo,2013-06-08 13:13:00,4754,I did my part...just got back from a trip to Balsam and caught a pike that had to be close to 40 inches. We ate the stinky beast.
791269,nlpaintballer,2013-06-08 16:46:00,122,"Impossible Rizzo, there are NO pike other than little hammer handles in that lake   Nice one, those big pike give some really nice fillets"

But the same experience, lots of perch followers..not a single pike was seen or caught though. May go back to the original Mitchell Plan for next time.  HFP"

I have a cottage on Canal lake. I fish Balsam at least twice a year. I caught 6 pike last year. The ministry wants people to keep all the pike caught to try and keep them from taking it over. I haven't caught as many in Canal lake in the last few years. A lot o bass though."
848844,Cando,2014-04-19 16:39:00,90,"Whoops typo, Should be Balsam."
848920,Dave Bailey,2014-04-20 01:13:00,1641,The ministry wants people to keep all the pike caught to try and keep them from taking it over.  Then they should remove the possession limit.
