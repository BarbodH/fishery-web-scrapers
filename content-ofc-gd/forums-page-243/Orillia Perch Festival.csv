847374,Fisherman,2014-04-12 19:39:00,7201,"Honestly, it can be hit and miss, some days the perch biting will be non stop, other days you couldn't blow one out of the water with a brick of C4.  Closer to the Narrows you can often see them swimming around in big schools, dangle the hook and minnow and they swim away.  Other days, you can drop a bare hook down and they're fighting for it.   Hope you pick the right day and your little fellow has fun."

847387,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-12 20:40:00,540,"Oh!  I thought it was like a ""festival"" lol.  I should really look this stuff up before posting."
847395,bigugli,2014-04-12 20:59:00,6138,They do have a Kid's day with all sort of activities at Tudhope Park on Sat May 3rd from 11am
847454,Fisherman,2014-04-13 01:20:00,7201,"I think years ago they changed  ""derby"" to ""festival"" to make it more P3TA correct.  Derby would make you think of lots of big fish to try and win.  Now you can enter the daily registration with a live perch no matter how small or big."
847794,Beans,2014-04-14 16:52:00,3339,We used to have good luck off the cement pier in the Orillia Beach park just north of the Harbourmaster's building near the statue...then there is the fishing only pier just outside of the Harbourmasters (South side)...best of luck !

849110,freddyp,2014-04-21 11:41:00,27,"Assuming you're boating... If the ice permits you can use the public launch at the end of Collins Rd/Smith's Bay. From there boat into the narrows, 2 small bays over and you'll see the perch in the marina's. If the ice isn't open enough yet Blue Beacon has a pay launch and I know they're open. As long as you don't tie up to their docks you're usually ok to fish in the marina areas, just respect the owners!Use minnows and tight lines! Or even when they're barely biting a rapala ice fishing jig is guaranteed to get you a few with a little finesse! They might just bump it but best part is there's a hook right there! Just keep jigging. Be sure to keep one each to bring in for the daily draw. And you must register before hand... @ Trombley's, Tudhope even Blue Beacon has registration forms.Best of luck!"
