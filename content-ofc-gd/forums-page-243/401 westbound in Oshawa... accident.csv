848669,Locnar,2014-04-18 22:20:00,645,"10 minutes ago, whilst driving home from work on the 401... I noticed what appeared to be road kill on the west bound, right near Harmony Rd... as I passed by, I saw what it really was... mangled bloody dead guy. Blood smears, no cops... so I just missed it. As I pulled off the highway in Courtice, I saw the police drive by with their lights on and knew exactly where they were heading. "
848673,redpearl99,2014-04-18 22:27:00,259,Dexter really messed up this time
848678,irishfield,2014-04-18 22:49:00,26272,Hope it was no one you knew...
848681,sauce,2014-04-18 23:01:00,219,"You might wanna contact the police.  If the guy that hit him took off, he possibly passed you at some point. Sounds like an awful thing to see."
848684,Locnar,2014-04-18 23:06:00,645,"The police were contacted, they were already on their way there."
848709,Big Cliff,2014-04-19 00:54:00,6899,"When I came past it about 7 there were two transport trucks stopped, one about 200 yards West and in the center lane and one about 25 yards East of the body, (which by then had been covered), a small black car almost at where the body was. Saddly someone isn't going to be spending Easter weekend with their family."

848714,grizzlybri,2014-04-19 01:11:00,565,I'm glad i came home when i did other wise i could have very well be stuck in the back up
848730,Locnar,2014-04-19 01:46:00,645,"Well big cliff, probably for the best that the body was covered... it was a bloody, twisted mess. The only car that I saw stopped was a red car. I heard that he was trying to cross the 401 and got smoked by a vehicle... I cannot attest to the accuracy of that rumour, but from the shape the body was in, I do not doubt"
848742,Big Cliff,2014-04-19 02:12:00,6899,"It might have been a red car, it was small and on the North side of the road, I didn't have time to really check it out. I suspect from the trucks that were stopped and their position it might have been the one I saw in the middle lane. No matter, still very sad!"
848751,Locnar,2014-04-19 02:23:00,645,"It was probably the truck in the middle lane... if it was stopped when you passed, i must have missed the action by seconds because there was no stopped trucks as I passed by. Insane."
848761,big guy,2014-04-19 03:09:00,414,Report on it  http://read.thestar.com/?origref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ca%2F#!/article/5351d03bec0691063e0004b9-man-dead-after-being-struck-by-vehicle-on-highway-401

848965,iFish4real,2014-04-20 14:28:00,386,"sounds like suicide, unless he was masively drunk or had mental problems...sad anyway"
848970,Big Cliff,2014-04-20 14:41:00,6899,It is sad that a life was lost regardless of the reason but I can't help wondering how it will affect the drivers that hit him?
848977,outllaw,2014-04-20 15:08:00,1232,I hate reading these things. ...thoughts for his family/friends and the driver.
