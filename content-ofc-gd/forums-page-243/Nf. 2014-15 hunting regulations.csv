847984,turtle,2014-04-15 11:10:00,274,The date on last year's regs was April 12.  I'm interested in the additional archery tags for WMU 78.  Last year there were none.

849081,mcdougy,2014-04-21 01:09:00,274,"Yes they seem to come online before they go to print. I did notice last years were april12th  just wondering if anyone knew a actual date. I am interested in finding GGS for moose. You can start buying tags and appplying I believe, but would like to know if we should apply for a bull or cow. We all know how much logic goes into the moose tag allocation and being able to read the regs SOMEWHERE would be helpful...."
849083,mcdougy,2014-04-21 01:16:00,274,Hold that thought just found the 2014 GGGS for 2014 online and looks as if they are going to be cutting way down on moose tags..3/4 of the areas have no guarantee regardless of group size
