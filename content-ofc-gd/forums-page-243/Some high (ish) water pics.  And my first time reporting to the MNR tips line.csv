848619,NAW,2014-04-18 17:05:00,4022,"So this morning, I wake up at 6:30 and can't get back to sleep.  Wife, son and dog are all sleeping.  So I'm thinkin early morning hill ride on my bike.  Nope, it's raining out..  OK, so I get a work out in, then do my taxes finally!!  This is weird, 9am, wife and boy are still sleeping...  So I wake them both up.  Son is not acting right.  Has a temp.  Moments after taking his temp, he decides its a good time to projectile vomit all over daddy!  A good 2 cups of matter flew from this kids face, and covered me....  This is the most puke I have ever seen come out of him..  Crappy start to the day.  But we decide to continue with our morning plans, which was to run up to Big Chute, and White's Falls to check out some high water.  I should have gone up a week ago, I think I would have been more impressed.  The water was no where near as high as I thought it would be.  I go to my first spot to check on the way up.  A little place I like to go for bows.  And this is what I see when I pull up..  This place opens next weekend.  And is a sanctuary up until that point.. And to top it off, they are within an illegal distance of a lamprey barrier.      So after a little pondering, I called MNR TIPS for the first time.  The woman on the hotline took my info.  15 minutes later I get a call from a CO.  He took more detailed info, and said he was going to make his way over.  I didn't say a word to the anglers.....  On to Whites Falls.  I've never seen it this high before.          Big Chute was not as spectacular as I was hoping...   This boy was like this the entire way!!   He only woke up for a few bumps on Big Chute Rd.    Aside from the vomiting, and rain, it was a good way to start of the long weekend.  Next weekend is openner!!  Can't wait."
848626,Musky or Specks,2014-04-18 17:49:00,2710,I hope they nailed him. Nice pics.
848630,NAW,2014-04-18 18:34:00,4022,"There was actually 2 guys fishing there.  When I walked over the bridge, with my cell phone out in the process of resting it on the ledge for a crisp sturdy shot. ....  The second guy turned his back an walked away."
848643,big guy,2014-04-18 19:31:00,414,"I hope they lose their car, everything.  Well done."
848652,Moosebunk,2014-04-18 20:05:00,3970,"Chose to do the same thing today.  Take a tour and take some pics.  Alls good from here to Tatlock, nobody out breaking rules cept maybe some trespassing deer, partridge and turkeys.  Good call today man!"
848664,Rustic-Fisher,2014-04-18 21:54:00,826,"Poaching losers ! Good on ya for calling them in. Hope it's followed up on. Sucks about the little guy, we were doing the puke and clean last week. Not fun !!!"
848666,SirCranksalot,2014-04-18 22:10:00,3291,"Are you sure they were fishing illegally? The way I read the regs, it's open downstream from the bridge on that river. Was the sign upstream from the bridge?  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/geospatialmaterial/241300.pdf"
848667,irishfield,2014-04-18 22:11:00,26272,Look at the second picture and see where the sign is...
848668,d_paluch,2014-04-18 22:12:00,343,"I called the MNR today for the first time too!  Was going to Terra greenhouses just north of Clapissons corner and decided to check out the pike grounds, aka Mountsberg Resevoir. There were 7 people fishing directly below the dam, all using jerkbaits and nailing pike one after the other. A couple guys were keeping them. Out on the main lake I saw 2 canoes, each with 2 people fishing.  Called up the MNR and told them everything, not sure if anything came of it but I am sick of people messing with our fisheries. Not to mention these same people are probably the ones who leave all of their garbage in the grass/bushes when there is a huge dumpster RIGHT BESIDE WHERE THEY PARK.  Stupid people, there is a LARGE sign near the path down to where they are fishing showing the species and when they are open"
848670,NAW,2014-04-18 22:24:00,4022," Thanks for your link and info.  But at this point, I don't doubt my actions."
848683,SirCranksalot,2014-04-18 23:06:00,3291,Wow! Now I'm puzzled. It's reasonable to expect what's written in the regs( as shown on their website) to match whatever signage there is in the field. Otherwise the fishermen have some basis to challenge any charge of poaching.
848687,NAW,2014-04-18 23:28:00,4022,The area these guys where fishing was not zone 14.  You might be mistaken on the location.
848694,Meegs,2014-04-18 23:38:00,249,Good job! that place is 100% closed till next weekend. Suprized noone was off the town dock in your one pic
848696,NAW,2014-04-18 23:43:00,4022,Thanks meegs!  There was only two guys in town fishing further up.  The rain must have been keeping them away.
848756,BillM,2014-04-19 02:56:00,17367,Thanks meegs! There was only two guys in town fishing further up. The rain must have been keeping them away.  I saw those two guys fishing today and just laughed when I drove by.  Do people not realize that you're not going to catch anything when the water has about a half an inch of vis?
848759,NAW,2014-04-19 03:00:00,4022,Ya...  She was blown pretty good eh...  I was surprised to see anyone at all to be honest...
848760,BillM,2014-04-19 03:03:00,17367,"I thought if anyone was going to be there, they'd be at the dock... Not up at one of those small bridges....  Did you end up checking out Swift Rapids?"
848762,NAW,2014-04-19 03:26:00,4022,Nah.  I was pressed for time.  Swift rapids with a sick baby in the backseat...  Oh boy.  We'd be cleaning up more puke for sure!!!!
848770,Joey,2014-04-19 04:43:00,9122,"Wow, that really is high.  Great pics.  Good on ya for calling MNR.  Hope they fined them!"
848818,BillM,2014-04-19 13:54:00,17367,"I usually call TIPS a few times a year, especially in the Fall on the Pine when our friends come up from the city and gank the salmens!"

848911,SirCranksalot,2014-04-19 23:37:00,3291,"Sorry, N.A.W., for causing any confusion. It looks like you were not at the location that I had assumed. In any case, given that there were signs, you did the right thing by phoning and I commend you for it!  Re the level at Big Chute---bear in mind that the river upstream is dam controlled for power generation, so they could be holding some back at this point."
