846134,hotsky,2014-04-07 02:07:00,400,I would like to do some fishing for cats next weekend in Dunville if the weather is nice. Tried a local spot today and didn't get anything. Has anyone tried this year?
846176,Court R,2014-04-07 13:03:00,213,Water still to cold.
846360,hotsky,2014-04-08 03:02:00,400,It is usually a certain temp when it happens?
846448,fishing,2014-04-08 15:48:00,167,"They start to bite when water temperature is above 5 or 6 °C, and it's only about 2 °C now. So wait for just a few more days, we will be good to go."
846482,lhousesoccer,2014-04-08 17:58:00,442,What do you guys use this time of year when it's cold?  I'm assuming you're bottom fishing with some sort of 3-way rig with a dropper and some smelly cut bait?
846743,Rich,2014-04-09 21:07:00,3927,"Until the water hits about 40 degrees, the best bet is freshly dead minnows on a jighead. Only caught some bullheads so far out that way myself.. but channels have been caught there already this year."
846812,HTHM,2014-04-10 01:02:00,4082,When Rich speaks you are wise to listen. I thought it was 43 degrees though?
847166,Rich,2014-04-11 09:32:00,3927,I never was too precise on the temps HTHM.. you may be dead on. For me it's when all the fringe ice and snow is completely gone and the currents have slowed down that it's time to run the cut baits. Ps thanks for the props! Lol
847172,mistaredone,2014-04-11 11:52:00,913,Google jeep death wobble. Just cost my budy 5 grand to fix his Rubicon
847178,jedimaster,2014-04-11 12:33:00,3472,Is that a new cat fish method? Me thinks you posted this in the wrong thread.
847238,aplumma,2014-04-11 19:10:00,6896,dead bait with lots of patients. We are at 50 degrees F right now and the bite is slow with muddy water and semi swift flow. Most fish caught on the dark flats or wind blown area. Back swirl areas should also be looked at as the fish kill from sever temperatures will pile up food for them to eat.   Art
847307,Ryan Landry,2014-04-12 03:13:00,128,That was random! Lol
847324,mistaredone,2014-04-12 13:03:00,913,Lol!  That was supposed to be on a towing thread??  Lol
847414,wormdunker,2014-04-12 23:07:00,1711,What's jeep got to do with cats??  Dun ville is with 2ns as in Dunnville.  LOL!
847416,hotsky,2014-04-12 23:10:00,400,I'm guessing he meant to post that in a Jeep thread.
847495,Rich,2014-04-13 12:46:00,3927,"The situation's a little different here Art. Your fish are residents. Ours are migrating from Lake Erie for a couple months, never to be seen again. Along with their migration comes a massive migration of emerald shiners which stay put til the water hits about 43 (thnx HTHM). The key areas right now are simply slack water. The river's been raging since March."
847514,Fishmaster,2014-04-13 13:45:00,920,The Cats are now Bitting just so you all know ...water Temp was 44 to 45 yesterday ...my shore line was packed with Carp and Cat Fisherman yesterday  Get Out and  Enjoy Fishmaster Bait & Tackle
847523,Rich,2014-04-13 14:35:00,3927,"^^ there's the man we really needed to hear from here lol, have at 'er.. i'll be going this week."
847530,Fisherpete,2014-04-13 15:45:00,1814,"If you go bring lots of weight - the river is flowing faster than I have ever seen it -  I was using two 3oz weights on Friday night and still getting pulled downstream in a hurry. Lots of debris being pulled along the bottom as well - weeds, sticks, leaves - covers your weight and cutbait pretty quick."
847630,aplumma,2014-04-13 23:36:00,6896,Interesting we have a winter kill of shad in the river that is like ringing the dinner bell. They live year round in the Potomac river due to the fact it flows to Saltwater.    Art
847743,dave524,2014-04-14 13:24:00,4508,"The situation's a little different here Art. Your fish are residents. Ours are migrating from Lake Erie for a couple months, never to be seen again.  Rich, lived in Port Rowan for a few years back in the early 70's, A few guys , me included , would fish channels all summer right up to duck season surf casting lake side off Hasting's Ave, best spot was where the old creek channel comes close to the lake. Wade a few yards out to the first bar and cast, come back to shore and set up in a rod holder and wait, some evening the action was very good. Can't see that they are still not there."
848638,Afraz,2014-04-18 19:02:00,250,Is the grand still flooded with high water ?
848797,Mirkydog,2014-04-19 12:16:00,4,Yep
