924662,captpierre,2015-07-14 03:03:00,2521,Out of Bluffers tonight for 5 hrs Fished 80-130 ft. 50-60 ft down Dipsies/spoons. And riggers with flies. 68-71 surface temps Few hooks and bait out far but lots of bait in tight Darn east wind.
924665,Freshtrax,2015-07-14 03:45:00,2215,I've had success fishing a little deeper than that in the west end the last two outings.   I mean deeper and running the balls deep too down around 100-125 over 180-280 fow.
924668,spincast,2015-07-14 09:35:00,3279,"If the winds are out of the East, I'm heading to a different lake. Been skunked on too many trips"
924670,dave524,2015-07-14 10:24:00,4508,"You need to lower a temperature probe before even setting lines, few days of east wind you can see it 60 degrees at 80 feet in the west end. If so pack up and move to Erie for Walleye or catch up on the honeydo's."
924678,FloatnFly,2015-07-14 11:42:00,1640,"And here I was expecting to see a picture of skunk in the lake!  Tough luck with the east winds though!   That old saying holds true, east is least, west is best"
924685,BillM,2015-07-14 12:23:00,17367,Been real patchy out there from some of the reports on Spoonpullers.
924701,Gallie,2015-07-14 13:55:00,1215,"Yea it sure has been a treat to fish so far, try running your flies on your dipseys or even 1 fly 1 spoon, i rarely run anything else on dipseys these days. On sat we went 2/4 (ugggh!) and the two we dropped were screamers one on the right dipsey with flasher fly and one on the left with ff. First one was on for about 5 min till the reel gave out and disintegrated in my hands, 2nd one got off after about a min with my buddy fighting it. Both fish were between 170-220 fow 50-70 down. Hopefully it picks up soon, my people are gettin antsy lol."
924731,captpierre,2015-07-14 17:01:00,2521,Was going to add. No fleas on lines but lots of nasty biting flies in the boat. Wear long pants and socks Bring a flyswatter
924741,Crazy Ivan,2015-07-14 17:35:00,184,"Agree about the flies, nasty little buggers!  Too hot to cover up - 'deep woods off' works. They dont like it."
924782,FloatnFly,2015-07-14 23:21:00,1640,"My dad is making the trip up from Sarnia on the long weekend, hopefully plenty of fish to be had by then"
