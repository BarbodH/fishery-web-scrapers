924612,Beans,2015-07-13 17:56:00,3339,Good to hear you are on the mend Lew...nasty buggers them wasps...  We have killed off two separate underground nests since we moved up this way...both times I poured gasoline down the entrance in the late evening then stuffed an old towel in the hole as far down as I could with a broom handle then more gasoline...  I removed a nest from the crawl space late in the fall one year after they had died off for the year then set it on fire to make sure the queen was dead...still amazed how they chewed through a metal screen...
924615,Mike Pike,2015-07-13 18:26:00,1332,"I remeber mowing my lawn one day and rolling over one of their underground nests.  Two of the buggers came out and stung me on each leg.  Painful and all these red blotches started breaking out on my body.  Anyhoo, I have no idea how I could have handled an attack of that many, Lew.  Pain must have been excruciating!"
924616,lew,2015-07-13 18:33:00,12766,"Pain must have been excruciating!  Yup, that pretty well describes it Mike, not one of my favorite days."
924617,Rodbender,2015-07-13 18:56:00,1027,I'm with you on that Lew in 1985 in Kap(junior Ranger program) I stepped into a burrowing bees nest my foot actually broke ground 165 bee stings from the knee down(glad the foreman was there with a water gun and knocked the rest of them off) in the Kap hospital for over a week now if I get stung it could be fatal I never felt that much pain and I'v broken a lot of bones ripped ligaments stabbed by an Ex not fun at all
924618,quickme,2015-07-13 19:23:00,261,great to hear that you are okay.  This could have been much worse which I'm sure your aware of.   Kill those my mom hates me!
924625,davey buoy,2015-07-13 21:09:00,5505,Did you get rid of the buggers yet Lew?.Maybe I missed that.?.
924627,lew,2015-07-13 21:24:00,12766,Did you get rid of the buggers yet Lew?.Maybe I missed that.?.  The deed will be done later this evening around sunset davey.  Sposed to happen last night but plans got changed around abit.
924629,Pigeontroller,2015-07-13 21:30:00,2793,Scary situation. Glad your ok...
924630,esoxansteel,2015-07-13 21:34:00,1307,"I hope those wasps go to sleep for you Lew, and you can do the manly deed, not like the birds who seem to be chirpin all night, and don't seem to want to sleep for some reason, do you think those pesky muskies might be getting back at you for stinging them all these years"
924633,lew,2015-07-13 21:49:00,12766,do you think those pesky muskies might be getting back at you for stinging them all these years  Are you suggesting a critter conspiracy Steve ??
924643,manitoubass2,2015-07-13 23:29:00,11391,"Looks like Ill be heading in now.  Just noticed one of my stings appears to be infected.  day after I was stung in that spot I had a quarter sized red spot  Stupid me I never bothered looking at it(as its near my hip), I look today and its about 8""s long and the only reason I looked aas because of how itchy it was"
924646,NANUK,2015-07-14 00:43:00,797,"Glad you're OK Lew, Could have been a lot worst. now go and blast those nasty buggers"
924648,lew,2015-07-14 00:58:00,12766,"Glad you're OK Lew, Could have been a lot worst. now go and blast those nasty buggers  I just walked in the door and the job is done and hopefully I got them all.  I emptied 2 cans of RAID wasp killer into the hole and the surrounding area 30 minutes ago and so far haven't seen another one. I got a good look at a couple of the dead ones and it looks like they were yellow jackets for sure.  Rick, sure hope you haven't got too much of an infection in those welts of yours."
924652,manitoubass2,2015-07-14 01:15:00,11391,No real symptoms Lew so hopefully Ill be good (just freaks me out that it appears to be spreading).  Glad you got those yellowjackets?
924735,mr blizzard,2015-07-14 17:21:00,1589,"Lew hope your on the mend , reminded me about 8 years back when I used to cut the lawn at moms house after my dad passed, they were in old town Woodbridge, 3/4 acre , tractor was not working so I got the lawn mower out, started cutting, stung twice, but wanted to finish the job, as my wife were living in Barrie area, went back out got zapped 3 more time, ran in the house one bugger was still flying in my shirt , got zapped before I could get him, all I could find was a dust covered old bottle of Dettol LOL  Got back Barrie and went to emerg, the one arm was swelling like a baseball bat But where I got stung on the legs were not swollen, the doc said some have a venom and some dont,  My son used to laugh for a few months after, bacaue when ever a fly or mosquito landed on me I would jump about a foot off the ground  Take care and keep the spray handy Cheers"
924418,misfish,2015-07-12 10:51:00,29133,Holy crapolla. My first read of the morning.    Glad your feeling better Lew. .
924419,lew,2015-07-12 11:04:00,12766,"Thanks fellas, I'm feeling great today other than a few spots that are still sore, specially in my left ear.  I'll head into town this morning for the bee killer aerosol and blast the daylights out of them this evening.  I've used this product before and it kills them instantly.  "
924420,buick14,2015-07-12 11:15:00,741,Omg that kinda thing seems like the last thing to worry about...sure a bite here qnd there.   Man u must have been so scared....im glad ur ok!
924422,Rich Clemens,2015-07-12 11:27:00,3131,"Glad to heAr you made it through this Lew.  Our one grand-daughter ran into a nest of bees in the ground some years back and they really did a number on her.   Nasty little buggers.   Thank goodness you are not allergic to,bee stings.    Drink a cup of coffee for me this morning if you will."
924423,FloatnFly,2015-07-12 11:33:00,1640,"Glad you're doing better! Gotta be wasps for sure, honey bees would not attack like that.  Get em all, glad it was an adult that found them, would be a much worse story if that was a young kid."
924424,TennesseeGuy,2015-07-12 11:50:00,957,"Glad you're okay Lew.   Could have been much worse.  I was lucky in almost your same situation when I disturbed a hornet nest in shrubs I was trimming.   Fortunately the hornets attacked the electric hedge trimmer and dive bombed it as I dropped it to the ground and ran.   They continued to dive bomb the hedge trimmer even after it was unplugged.   Late in the afternoon I drove my truck to within about 10 feet of them, rolled down the window a few inches and sprayed the little guys.   It worked.   Don't give them a chance to get you again when you spray.   Since your system is already topped up with their nastiness you might consider having a neighbor do the job for you.  I'd volunteer if the drive weren't so long.  My shrubs are ready for a trimming and last week I sprayed them with insect spray so I'll be okay to trim in coming days.  I was lucky the first time.   Believe I already said that.  Since they're in the ground you might locate their hole in the ground and start a walk behind mower over their nest, then wait for the sun to come up which will cause them to get out of bed and head out of the hole.    Still a good idea to check the hole for a few days."
924427,bigbuck,2015-07-12 12:11:00,2449,A pot of boiling hot water also works well. Pour it down the hole and you kill the nasty buggers. No chemicals. I have had a couple of ground nests and thats how I dealt with them.
924428,TennesseeGuy,2015-07-12 12:14:00,957,You're right.   Good idea.   Guess I was wanting a body count.
924429,lew,2015-07-12 12:25:00,12766,I'm gonna use the RAID killer 1st and I'm sure it'll do the trick. We found a nest under the deck last year and this stuff was amazing. I hit it about 5 in the morning before the critters were awake and we never saw another one. Pulled the nest down and dumped it way back in the woods.  Lotsa good suggestions though and all appreciated.  Or maybe I can catch them alive and haul them down the road to my buddies place who's having a problem with the Canada Geese using his property as a public washroom. I'll get rid of my bees and he may get rid of his geese....win win for everybody
924430,Gallie,2015-07-12 12:45:00,1215,"Glad to hear you are ok buddy! When i was a kid i collapsed a ground hornets nest in my backyard and was swarmed instantly, i was stung almost 30 times and definitely felt some of those symptoms. The kicker being it was on my birthday! Important note lew, after that attack i devolped a mild allergy to bees so that a single sting will swell an entire appendage or even limb so i have to be very careful now, it might be in your interest to take an allergy test and/or buy an epi pen to carry with you. Good luck on your recovery, i need to see some big ski pics from you yet!!"
924431,OhioFisherman,2015-07-12 12:49:00,6623,"Glad to hear you are OK Lew!  Years ago I had an experience with them, I was cutting some high weeds in a field behind my old home with a scythe, the next thing I knew I was under attack!  I went running to the back of the house and turned on the garden hose and started spraying myself and the area around me to chase them away. My two older girls were young then, and thought dad was playing and came running over to play too. I chased them in the house so they wouldn't become new targets.  I must have gotten stung 20-30 times, but no problems from it, I certainly don't want it to happen again though."
924434,bigcreekdad,2015-07-12 13:14:00,546,Good God Lew!!  Glad you are OK. 
924436,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-12 13:17:00,8243,I just turned on this Laptop after a few days and see this! Glad you are better. How many Bees died from stinging you?
924438,bow slayer,2015-07-12 13:51:00,1074,"sorry to hear this,I had a similar incident with them a couple times. If they are borrowed in a hole in the ground they are probably yellow jackets(wasp). very aggressive if you go anywhere near the nest. What I did was wait til they settle down in the evening then pour gas down the hole and light it. Took care of the problem. I guess you could also empty a can down the hole in the evening as well as they should all be in there and in a relaxed state."
924439,bow slayer,2015-07-12 13:55:00,1074,heres a link that might help...http://www.doyourownpestcontrol.com/yellowjackets.htm
924450,lew,2015-07-12 15:41:00,12766,"Thanks for that link bowslayer, it was interesting reading.  I just got back from town with a couple large aerosol cans of bee,wasp & hornet killer by RAID. We're heading up towards Bancroft for dinner tonight and if we're back before dark I'll do it then, otherwise I'll wait till Monday evening.  All the stings I received are now showing up as red dots red  it looks like I got hammered even more times than I originally thought plus some swelling under each eye where I got hit alot.  Oh well, I'm feeling pretty good now and will just chalk this one up to one of lifes little hiccups."
924451,Joey,2015-07-12 15:43:00,9122,"Holy moly Lew, that is some scary stuff.  So glad you are okay bud!!  Hope the bites don't hurt for too long and you are back to normal soon!!!"
924452,mistyriver1,2015-07-12 15:55:00,600,"Holy crap Lew.  Same thing happened to Sue a few years ago at Lakair, it's scary stuff.  Glad you are feeling better my friend.  Take it easy."
924554,doubleheader,2015-07-13 12:51:00,497,Apparently you're just too tough for those little beasties Lew. Glad everything worked out okay.
924559,lew,2015-07-13 13:10:00,12766,Apparently you're just too tough for those little beasties Lew.  I didn't look so tough when I was laying crumpled on the floor Fred
924561,BillM,2015-07-13 13:31:00,17367,"Holy crap Lew!  Similar thing happened to my oldman, ran over a nest of yellowjackets with the lawnmower, they got him good!"
924562,manitoubass2,2015-07-13 13:35:00,11391,How ya feeling now Lew?  I got hammered by hornets as I mentioned earlier and that goldbond anti itch lotion works wonders
924571,Fisherman,2015-07-13 14:30:00,7201,"Glad you beat the little stabbers,  got hit in the side of the throat years ago, lost vision in one eye for about 2 minutes, that venom must be nasty poop."
924593,James77,2015-07-13 15:47:00,175,"Lew, glad to hear you're doing well! I've had a few run ins with the Peterborough hospital over the last few years and they've always been great."
924606,crappieperchhunter,2015-07-13 16:51:00,2582,Doesn't sound like any fun Lew but I'm glad to hear your doing good.
924363,lew,2015-07-12 00:51:00,12766,Today was beautiful and I spend hours in the yard just working and the flower beds and grass.  I was down on my hands & knees when it suddenly felt like someone was sticking needles in me. Within seconds I was being attacked by a huge swarm of bees and after a couple more seconds most of my body was covered in the bees.  I was wearing shorts and T-Shirt so there was plenty of bare skin for them to go after and I swear every bee hated me and was doing their best to kill me. I pulled off the T-Shirt and used it to try and swat away as many as possible while I ran for the back door.  I sure as heck didn't want them in the house so I stayed on the deck until I was sure I had them all off me then I made and mad dash inside and closed the door behind me but the swarm was still trying to get at me.  Within seconds my head started spinning like crazy and I couldn't stand up anymore so I sat down on the nearest chair. While the whole world was spinning like crazy I started feeling sick like I've never felt before and I honestly thought this attack and the huge amounts of venom was killing me.  The nearest ambulance is in Lakefield which is 8 miles south of  me and when we called 911 they were here within 10 minutes and  the volunteer firemen were here before them.  I was a fireman down in Toronto for 32 years and can't tell you how absolutely impressed I was with all the emergency personel who responded and took care of me.  They immediately put me on oxygen and epronephron (sp) then loaded me into an ambulance for the long rush down to Peterboro hospital. It was lights & siren the whole way and the normal 40 minute drive was done in half  that time.  My whole body was shaking and I was in alot of pain.  I was rushed into Emergency and they started helping me almost before the stretcher came to a halt. They hooked me up to a bunch of fluids and treated me like I was the most important person in the hospital.  They kept me there for 5 hours until I was feeling better and once they saw I could walk down the aisle and back without tipping over they sent me home.  I'm still weak and many of the bites are still very sore but most of the swelling has gone away and I'll be good as new in the morning....hopefully.  It may be the worst medical emergency I've ever personally gone through and I know my wife and daughter were both scared for my life.   Out here in the country it's nice to know we have outstanding emergency crews around and a hospital not too far away that treats the patients with total respect and  the dedication shown by the staff at Peterboro hospital.  Long story but I'm just glad I made it thru OK....and so are my family and and friends.  SO...how was YOUR day.  Picture my daughter took with her phone.  
924366,spincast,2015-07-12 01:03:00,3279,"wow - that is some scary Lew. Glad to hear you are OK - bee venom can be nasty, and that sounds very painful . Hope you don't become sensitized to bee stings  from this event. Did you happen to dig into a nest that they went nuts one you? Or is there an after shave we need to know about ? (just kidding) Take it easy and best wishes for s speedy recovery"
924367,Tomcat,2015-07-12 01:04:00,395,My day was a heck of a lot better than your day Lew!  So sorry to hear of your ordeal. One just never knows when something unwarranted or uninvited is going to happen that can impact your life as you know it. Suffice to say that I'm happy to hear about your timely excellent care and that you're feeling somewhat better.
924369,LeXXington,2015-07-12 01:07:00,1928,"Wow Lew, take care!  That many bee's could be fatal if the body reacts bad.  Glad your OK.."
924370,bigbuck,2015-07-12 01:09:00,2449,Ouch!!! Epinephrine us your friend. Are you allergic or was it just that you got stung so many times? Shoulda smiled at them.
924371,kickingfrog,2015-07-12 01:09:00,8333,"Geez Lew, glad everything is ok. Have some honey on your toast in the morning."
924372,Snowball,2015-07-12 01:10:00,167,Sorry to hear about your very painful event.  Take care!  Snowball
924373,chris.brock,2015-07-12 01:17:00,4053,"We (me included) whine about our high taxes, but we don't complain about the help we get when we need it.  Glad you're ok, good story."
924375,captpierre,2015-07-12 01:21:00,2521,"Glad you are on the mend, Lew. Close call for sure. You musta really pissed off those bees. Or were they wasps or hornets. Not like bees to do that"
924376,captpierre,2015-07-12 01:21:00,2521,"Glad you are on the mend, Lew. Close call for sure. You musta really pissed off those bees. Or were they wasps or hornets. Not like bees to do that"
924377,HTHM,2015-07-12 01:23:00,4082,Heres to a full recovery!
924384,lew,2015-07-12 01:36:00,12766,"Not like bees to do that  Thanks guys and I'm feeling better by the minute.  I was in a bit of panic mode I spose and honestly don't know for sure what they were, but they didn't appear to be as long as a wasp or hornet & I'd guess they were maybe a 1/2-3/4 inch long but I'm sure no expert on them.  Interesting too how there's always somone alot worse off than we think we are.  As I was laying on the stretcher in the ER feeling sorry for my lousy luck, a man was wheeled in on a stretcher with his face covered in blood and shortly after that another ambulance brought in a small boy who was crying and wearing a neck brace and was followed by a police officer so we just sorta guessed the little guy was in some type of accident.  No matter how bad we've got it, someone else has it alot worse.  And I've got good neighbors around here too, after they saw me leave in the ambulance somebody put away all my tools and lawnmower."
924386,Pikeslayer,2015-07-12 01:41:00,1443,Holy moley Lew. Happy to hear you're all square.
924387,glen,2015-07-12 01:44:00,2641,Glad your ok.   I sprayed a big hive today.  That spay works great. Bees don't bother me much but I keep them under control for others. Get lots of rest and then hunt them down.  I saw you on 11 south bound when I was north bound two weeks ago.
924389,lew,2015-07-12 01:54:00,12766, I saw you on 11 south bound when I was north bound two weeks ago.  We were coming back from a week at Mashkinonje Lodge on the West Arm Glen. Heading up to Memquisit for a couple more weeks in August.
924391,woodenboater,2015-07-12 02:05:00,2277,"holy smoking jayzus Lew ! Glad help was there asap and you're much better. never heard of swarm attacks like that before unless a nest or colony was threatened but you've been there for years so it's strange that this happened.  Be interesting to have a local beekeeper come by and see if he can figure out what they were. I know I've seen few things that I haven't seen before. metallic blueish looking thing, almost wasp length but didn't bother me. wonder if keeping an epi pen or something similar on hand would be worth looking into having on hand."
924393,Rustic-Fisher,2015-07-12 02:12:00,826,Wow! Glad your ok . Scary stuff .
924397,Gerritt,2015-07-12 02:26:00,6129,Wow that's some scary stuff Lew! I have seen plenty of bees that live in burrows underground. Perhaps you disturbed them?  They don't have hives per say but burrow deep and that's where they live out their lives...coming and going to collect pollen and nectar etc... Keep an eye out in that general area for bees landing in the grass and see if you can find their burrow and spray the heck outta it.  I'm glad to see you are alright! Could have been much worse.  G
924398,craigdritchie,2015-07-12 02:28:00,1586,"Also spent my day working in the yard, but it wasn't nearly as exciting as yours.  I'm very grateful for that.  Glad to hear you're going to be ok. Once you're back on your feets, you might want to call a pest control guy to get rid of the hive you evidently stirred up. Sometimes they're in the ground."
924399,lew,2015-07-12 02:43:00,12766,"I have a 2' high  wooden retaining wall in the yard and I was trimming the grass right at the end of it. I'm thinking the bees were living down in the ground where the wooden 6x6 timbers meet the ground. That was my 1st impression anyways.  My neighbor dropped off a pressurized container of bug killer for tomorrow but there's an aerosol made specifically for killing wasps, hornets and bees that I've used before and it practically kills on contact. I may go into town tomorrow and grab a couple cans.  I'll definitely be wearing long pants, gloves and my bug jacket when I do the deed though."
924401,Kerry,2015-07-12 02:45:00,383,Sounds definately like you disturbed a ground hornets nest.The hole opening will likely be up to 2 inches and you might mistake it for a skunk or squirrel grubbing around the lawn.They are nasty.Sting first and once one gets set off they all go.Had a nest in our back yard that was 3ft down.Took 3 separate tries at burning it out before we finally got it. Good to here you are doing OK. Kerry
924410,manitoubass2,2015-07-12 05:57:00,11391,"Holy crap lew!  Glad your ok and were well taken care of?  I hope your feeling much better, thats pretty crazy.  I got hit today with hornets(no lie), so I find this kinda ironic.  Got ready for the evening campfire, grabbed a piece of firewood and all the sudden it felt like hot embers were dropping on me. It was half dark so I could'nt see what was going on so I kept truckin about wondering what the heck?  By the time i realized it was hornets i already had quite afew stings. Hard to tell how many lol my upper body still feels like its on fire.  I dislike hornets  Heal well Lew?"
924411,Big Cliff,2015-07-12 08:17:00,6899,Sorry to hear about the incident but I'm sure glad to hear that everything worked out as well as it did for you!
924413,NewHips,2015-07-12 10:03:00,111,Scary to say the least.........Glad it had a positive outcome. Prayers coming your way for a fast recovery.
924415,davey buoy,2015-07-12 10:22:00,5505,"Holy cow Lew,glad your on the mend . Lawn mowed over one a few years back.Rotted stump under ground. 20 stings before I could make it into the house.Ankles only for the most part.Just at about dark that same evening,a can of hornet blaster when you know they are all in for the night.One long steady spray did it.Doing this during the day would not be a good thing.Take care Lew."
