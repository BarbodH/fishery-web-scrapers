925436,Sterling,2015-07-20 18:47:00,477,Thinking of picking up a t-box (http://store12459.americommerce.com/store/p/27-SP200-T-BOX.aspx) and hooking it up to a tablet.  My only concern is; will the unit allow me to see the thermocline?  Anyone have an idea?

925510,wormdunker,2015-07-21 09:21:00,1711,This looks like an interesting piece of electronics.  Good luck!  I'll follow this thread to see what comments other people offer.

925522,Gallie,2015-07-21 11:38:00,1215,A buddy of mine was thinking of getting one of these but i steered him towards a cheap humminbird finder instead why kill the battery on your phone in 2 hours when you could just get a ff for a couple hundered? Even the less expensive models now have awesome detail. Either way best of luck with whatever you decide and let us know how it goes.
925538,porkpie,2015-07-21 13:42:00,2521,I agree. A decent greyscale unit can be had for under $100 these days.  Spend $150 and you can have color.

Thing is, I'm interested in the plot charting (on the fly) made possible by the sonarphone setup. Seeing the thermocline is a bonus!"
