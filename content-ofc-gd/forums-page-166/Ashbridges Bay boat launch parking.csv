I am considering launching out of there tomorrow.  I don't want to drive all the way down there and find out that there is no where to park.  Also, do you know what is costs to park there?  I have only ever used it in April when the parking is free."
925157,msp,2015-07-18 02:00:00,1336,Plenty of available parking down there. Better get there early to guarantee a spot. Cost $7 for the vehicle and $7 for the trailer

That's a lot of water so not sure hope often they spot check. Thought about getting the license but never got around to it.  and it's a big lot but bring your nose plugs, last time I was there, the place reeked of who knows what died upstream"

The eastern boundry is around Victoria Park or the Harris water treatment plant.  A harbour license is required for the Ashbridges Bay launch.  I have one, so that is not a problem.  It sounds like parking may be an issue on weekends.  Thanks for the responses.  I have new plans for tomorrow; but may try out there later this year.    "
