925466,Steve,2015-07-21 00:16:00,2075,"apparently not..at least accordingly to work......  we were allowed virtually any phone on the market .... and the company would buy them (or put money towards them, depending on how much they cost) ... all except a BB  edit: so I went back and pulled my cell phone papers from when I got my new phone and the reason we can't use Blackberries is because BB doesn't support the Good Enterprise Application (or at least at the time of purchase - November 2014). I just did a quick search, and it appears BB still does not support the Good application."
925483,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-21 01:49:00,10439,"I would pay cash to go back to a blackberry. (I would die for a keyboard again).  our company will not support blackberry software right now. Many ap's we use, and require, aren't available on the BB platform (I guess the enterprise BB server isn't worth it anymore either).  sad days.  I can't type using on screen keyboards. Always hitting the wrong key, not so with my BB. I just upgraded  to the Classic. Nice phone and have been able to get most android apps to run but you do need to tweak them a bit.  Actually the BB Enterprise server now works with iphones and android devices. It enables you to secure them, have a locked work space and be able to wipe them on command just like you can with BB devices."
925488,woodenboater,2015-07-21 02:04:00,2277,"I have an Otterbox for my 6 but can't remember which one. All I scan say if I lost in the snow in the gutter of a Fort Frances sidewalk and when I found it, worked like nothing happened. has the screen cover that allows bio locking which can be very useful.  I missed my BB keyboard for a year or so but the iPhone is a better media consumer and has more apps that I need. If BB Storm was not fumbled, they'd have more share."
925496,manitoubass2,2015-07-21 03:02:00,11391,What? You were in fort frances and never hit me up?  Im sad
925500,Freshtrax,2015-07-21 03:24:00,2215,FYI Samsung s4.  Is on for 0 $ on a two year at rogers... Was due for an upgrade picked one up for the wife today .....still a great phone.
925507,fishindevil,2015-07-21 08:01:00,6254,Lots of great ideas guys !!! Thanks !!!  I will be looking at a few different models for sure now including the LG model as mentioned by a few like I said mostly for the basics & pictures & Facebook and weather apps and of course our site ofc !!!  )  and some have said the newer phones are way bigger and don't fit in your pocket very well !!! I have an otter box on my iPhone and it does make it a fair bit bigger and bulkier do I will take it all into consideration when getting a new one very shortly !!!! Any more ideas keep them Comming.      Thanks.     Shawn
925539,FrankTheRabbit,2015-07-21 13:50:00,479,"if you go the Android route, you may want to consider the type of Android OS to use. OnePlus, Motorola, and Nexus phones have a pure Android experience. Very clean interface and no manufacturer bloat ware. Majority of the other Android manufacturers (Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony, etc) installs their own version of Android, which includes many other features not found in pure Android. Over time, some of these extra features can take a hit on the phone's performance. Also, they receive the slowest updates. Android Lollipop has been released over a year ago and some Samsung phones have only started receiving updates recently. Some other manufacturers won't even bother supporting it because they're busy working on their next phones. Personally, if you go the Android route, I'd stick with a pure Android device, with the OnePlus being close to the pure Android experience. The last I've heard with the OnePlus phone, although great in price, is based on an invite system. You'll need someone that has a OnePlus phone to send you an invite to purchase it. And even then, because they're a small player in the phone industry, there might be inventory problems.  As for the iPhone cases, I've been using a LifeProof case, which is slim and waterproof at the same time. It also allows you to use the thumb print reader with the case on, so your phone is completely sealed.  Have fun with your phone shopping experience!"
925546,leaf4,2015-07-21 15:08:00,2466,They got rid of the invite system and are actually releasing the oneplus two very soon!
925547,porkpie,2015-07-21 15:27:00,2521,"Whatever you get, be wary of lifeproof cases.  While very slim and compact, I am on my 3rd case now.  They were great with warranty replacement, but the cases don't last.  I will try the otter waterproof case next, even though it is significantly bulkier than lifeproof."
925548,BillM,2015-07-21 15:33:00,17367,Why not send the phone off to Liquipel?  A lot cheaper in the long run then a $50 case X 3.  http://www.liquipel.com/
925550,porkpie,2015-07-21 15:41:00,2521,"I had never heard of it, interesting idea.  And lifeproof cases are closer to $100 than to $50.  The only reason I have one still is because the 2nd and 3rd case where warranty replacement."
925639,Sinker,2015-07-22 00:47:00,8692,"I have the Q10 with the keyboard, because I always liked the keyboard over touch, but the keyboard on this phone is garbage.  It is a tough phone though.  S."

925659,pics,2015-07-22 03:56:00,1268,"After watching the latest update on the apple documentary (where they send in an undercover journalist into the factory), I wouldn't ever buy one.. I'm not saying any other manufacturer is better but when you have 150 some odd billion in cash on hand ,you need to have all your ducks in a row when it comes to treating people right.. They are WAY over priced..Apple claims to make 248 bucks on each phone but it could be double that according to the documentary.... they seem to break easy as well...."
925334,fishindevil,2015-07-20 00:42:00,6254,My iPhone 5 is had it's day and I'm looking for new phone I have had 3 iPhones now and don't care if I get the new 6 if it's worth it ??? What about going to android & the galaxy too line phoeb ... ??? Any pros or cons    Thanks
925335,fishindevil,2015-07-20 00:45:00,6254,A bigger screen would be nice as my eyes are not getting any better ... Lol and way more memory this iPhone 5 has 16 gigs and it's full !!!! Time for an upgrade going shopping very as on to to decide just wanted some opinions on the two models !!!!     Thanks.      Shawn
925337,leaf4,2015-07-20 00:48:00,2466,"Android is much nicer IMO, more like a computer and less limited."
925339,woodenboater,2015-07-20 00:59:00,2277,I have a 6 but know people who wish they'd bought a 6+ instead of 6. got mine with 128 gbs of ram. camera is great. much will depend on how many apps u use.
925340,Raf,2015-07-20 01:00:00,3495,"i have the samsung note 4, great phone huge screen."
925345,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-20 01:31:00,10439,â€‹These were just announced this past week. Look like kick donkey little pieces of tech. Especially if you're a music lover.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phones/11745730/Marshall-launches-loudest-mobile-phone-on-Earth-for-music-lovers.html  
925346,FrankTheRabbit,2015-07-20 01:37:00,479,"I've had a few phones in the past and from my experience: If you wanna tinker and tweak and spend time getting the most out of your mobile device, Android, hands down. If you want a phone that you use and download apps, Apple iOS is what I found to be better.  I remember spending hours tinkering with an old Galaxy Nexus phone and it's fun and all when you have the time to do all that stuff. Lately, I'd rather spend time on other things (like fishing ), instead of tinkering/tweaking a phone, so Apple's iOS works for me.  No point debating which eocsystem is better, it's an endless debatejust write out a list of things you'd want your next phone to do and base your decision on that."
925351,manitoubass2,2015-07-20 02:00:00,11391,I have the galaxy 6x now and I strongly prefer it over my iphone  Tons of memory too and drop box is an awesome feature
925352,porkpie,2015-07-20 02:02:00,2521,"I went from an iphone 3 to the latest galaxy at the time.  I dumped it just as soon as the iphone 5 came out.  As the guy above mentioned, if you like playing with the phone, android is for you.  If you just want to download the apps you use, check email and calenders  and browse the net etc.  then iphone has it hands down .  I am an iphone guy, because it is extremely user friendly within the limits I use it.  I don't need a rocket ship, just a workhorse.  The androids can do lots, but they are just not required for me.  It will depend what kind of user you are."
925365,wormdunker,2015-07-20 06:59:00,1711,"I'm on my 3rd IPhone - now a 5s.  I'm a basic phone user -  internet, camera, gps (maps), talk, text a few apps.    I'm not interested in learning a new phone.  Way too many techy things for me."
925367,fishindevil,2015-07-20 07:51:00,6254,I mainly use it for all the basic stuff weather apps fishing apps taking lots of pics and checking emails and stuff like what worm dunker said !!! And yes wasn't sure about getting to know a new phone & system as the iPhone is pretty easy to figure put and I have had them for years now !! I think the biggest thing I need is a bit bigger screen and lots more memory  and like I said mostly just basic stuff is what I use this phone for was just wondering like I said all the pros & cons of both before I get another one
925374,BillM,2015-07-20 09:41:00,17367,Can't go wrong with either.
925397,MrSimon,2015-07-20 12:38:00,217,"I recently upgraded and had to choose between the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6+.  I liked the huge screen on the 6+, but it was too difficult to use with one hand and too big to put in my pocket.  I went with the iPhone 6 and love it.  It's screen is still quite large, the cameras are great, everything works smoothly and I didn't have to read any manuals.  I really like the thumb reader.  No more passwords."
925400,Steelheadphycho,2015-07-20 12:54:00,470,"I throw the thought of switching from my iPhone 5s to the galaxy just for the simple fact it is fully submersible. The iPhone's are so delicate when it comes to water. You can get protective cases, but all the waterproof ones are so bulky. I've always been with iPhone and I can't imagine switching. I've heard many times that iPhone users who switch hate it and Galaxy users who switch hate it and they all want to go back to their tried and true........  There really is a lot to consider"
925402,Lape0019,2015-07-20 12:59:00,647,I use a Lifeproof case. Its water proof and not terribly bulky. I have not found a thinner case for the Iphone 6 yet.  I am hard on my cases though and they don't tend to last a year.
925419,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-20 15:57:00,4399,"I left Samsung for the LG G3....awesome phone with nice features, great camera features...my old eyes love the big screen....and it actually makes a decent phone call!!!"
925422,manitoubass2,2015-07-20 16:10:00,11391,Another plus on the galaxy 6x is it has really good battery life compared to my iphone.  Also it comes with a buncha apps I use already preloaded on the phone  The iphone is WAY MORE user friendly outta the box.  My galaxy 6x took a week or so to get used too and learn all the functions.  It take really great pics but most new phones do nowadays.  Also the galaxy6x is water resistant. They claim waterproof but no way am i testing that out lol. But it has gotten wet and no hiccups or damage from rain or light water.  Dropbox is an awesome feature that allows you to store music and pictures and they dont use memory on your phone. I find that awesome but it already has alot of memory so in one year I havent had to use it.  Just some other things to consider...
925423,manitoubass2,2015-07-20 16:11:00,11391,Either or I will say I think youde be happy with almost any new phone on the market these days
925431,quickme,2015-07-20 17:42:00,261,"i was a loyal Iphone user (3,4,4s,5,5s) and after seeing where iphone was going ( now where) I made the switch.  I went with the Oneplus one.  ( www.oneplus.net )  Great phone and much cheaper than a samsung, LG or HTG.  I use my phone for a lot of things and this does what I need it to do. Email, photo's, Navionics, etc.  64gb is under $400 and unlocked ( great for travelling)   Its can customize if you are into it or it can be a simple plug and play."
925449,Steve,2015-07-20 22:52:00,2075,"without adding any extra cases, straight out of the box, the Galaxy will last longer ....  if your hard on your phone, iPhones break....  Our office stopped replacing iPhones after the third break....  Yes, it's the users fault for dropping, etc, their phone.  But we seem to replace far less Galaxy phone's than iPhone's...  Both phones work to their intended purposes."
925453,leaf4,2015-07-20 23:17:00,2466,"+1 to this, I also have a oneplus. If you want a comparable it has similar specs to the LG G3 which is a very good option as well, my girlfriends younger brother just got one and its a very clean user experience"
925455,Sinker,2015-07-20 23:30:00,8692,"My gf just got the LG G3 and yeah, its slick.  My work supplies my phone. Its a blackberry, and it sucks. I hate using it!!  S."
