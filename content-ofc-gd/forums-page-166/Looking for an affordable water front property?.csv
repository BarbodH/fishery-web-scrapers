The Petoskey News-Review reports that an online auction started July 1 for the Isle Aux Galets lighthouse on Skillagalee Island. The active lighthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places and is being sold through the U.S. General Services Administration. The new owners will be required to maintain the light following government standards for treating historic properties. Skillagalee Island is about eight miles offshore of Cross Village in northern Michigan's Emmet County. General Services Administration spokeswoman Catherine Langel says, ""Isle Aux Galets is available for sale because advancements in navigation technology have reduced the Coast Guard's requirement to own and operate houses."" The only bid as of July 13 was for $5,000 US. Bids must be increased by increments of $1,000 US. No auction closing date has been announced  The corner store might be a bit of a drive though https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Skillagalee+Island,+Michigan,+USA/@45.6883027,-85.1075434,12.5z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4d4a42ef0a9921b5:0xf159f550e26888df"

I suspect there would be severe limitations on any modification to the site. The old saying fits here ""If it sounds to good to be true it probably is""."
924825,bigcreekdad,2015-07-15 12:08:00,546,I read something this morning that indicated lighthouse sales were only to non profit corporation that would maintain them in working status. Owning and living in one does sound kinda neat though.
