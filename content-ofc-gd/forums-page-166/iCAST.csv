924946,kickingfrog,2015-07-16 01:09:00,8333,Not sure how close some might be following iCAST but wondered what had caught your eye?  Saw something about a low profile baitcaster with a 9:1 gear ratio.

925093,AKRISONER,2015-07-17 15:37:00,5558,   this blew my mind  Live Target hollow body
925094,fishindevil,2015-07-17 15:37:00,6254,Some of the new swim baits look amazing !!! As well as the new high gear reels !!! I have a 7.1 and it's great but wow !!! A 9 would be awesome for some applications for sure

925100,kickingfrog,2015-07-17 16:36:00,8333,    this blew my mind  Live Target hollow body  Big deal.  
925103,manitoubass2,2015-07-17 16:44:00,11391,^^^???
925108,Lunkerhunter,2015-07-17 17:10:00,455,the new plano muskie box looks good.  as does the new abu Garcia revo toro beast muskie reel. I am curious to see how this performs next to the Calcutta and tranx.
925121,manitoubass2,2015-07-17 18:37:00,11391,Better not be better than the tranx lol. I just got mine a few months back
925138,kickingfrog,2015-07-17 21:47:00,8333,Too bad it only comes in a right side version.  
925146,FrankTheRabbit,2015-07-17 23:57:00,479,"Looking forward to the Stradic FK. Specs and photos sure look nice!  9:1 lowpro casting reel, how lowpro is it? I think the Zillion TWS comes in 9:1, but it's a pretty big honking reel."

925246,Lape0019,2015-07-19 02:44:00,647,That sunfish is the one item I have to have. Looks amazing and that video just sealed the deal. I have an 8.5:1 metanium XG and it has its place and time and works wonders. I don't know if I would ever need to go faster than that though.
925324,craigdritchie,2015-07-19 21:15:00,1586,"lots of stuff, my facebook has been bombarded with plugs on all the new stuff.  Not sure it's open to the public? but it and the classic are on my bucket list of places to attend  Not open to public - trade only (meaning dealers, distributors, manufacturers and legitimate media). Still some tournament guys running around begging for freebees, but the show management continues to do a great job of weeding out the beggars.  It was a good show this year, record attendance (over 12,000) and it was a noticeably loud building ... lots of conversations, deals being done, contracts being signed. Nice change from 5 - 6 years ago, when you could hear a pin drop from 200 feet away. Combining with the fly tackle dealer show seems to be working out well."
925633,misfish,2015-07-22 00:04:00,29133,"Craig, can ask why ""Not open to public""  What I mean to say is, can you amagine the crowds, let alone the gate fees.  This would be the ULTIMATE fishing show. Just need a stop here in Ontario."
