Looks like there isn't much information on Nine Mile, but may help you avoid targeting something that's not there  http://www.muskokawaterweb.ca/lake-data/mnr-data/lake-fact-sheet/mnr-n"

924719,jtracc,2015-07-14 15:38:00,97,Ya that's the lake... I remember lots of fish and even a few nice ones but that was over 10 yrs ago

If you head up give a wave to the three cottages on the left just as you enter Moon Bay,they were the first cottages built on the lake and have been in the family from day one. Will hopefully be heading up with my boys this summer at some point. Oh and watch for bears along the road in as someone hits at least one a year.  Dan"
