924688,Cast-Away,2015-07-14 12:52:00,790,I really can't stand when some of you guys get so negative on these positive posts about the event and some even getting off topic about car salesmen. My parents used to say if you don't have anything good to say then keep your comments to yourself.  Go find another forum where people like all of the negativity because OFC is not the place for this.

924702,Gregoire,2015-07-14 14:00:00,1397,"I agree that I got off topic. My point is similar to the one Cast-away made, just not stated as well. The games are a great opportunity to celebrate athleticism, and I am enjoying them. If you don't that is fine, but please don't get all negative about petty little things, as in my opinion there is far too much negativity in the world. If people were to appreciate what they have, instead of tearing down what they see wrong in others, and even maybe celebrating with others, or at least take action instead of just criticizing, the world would be a better place in my opinion. Sorry again for getting off topics."

924710,ratherboutdoors,2015-07-14 15:02:00,132,Back on topic...  sort of....  I have 4 tickets for sale in the classified section for anyone interested.
924718,misfish,2015-07-14 15:24:00,29133,"The games are what it is. Im not sure if the city/ province will win or not with this.  I cant wrap my mind around this though,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Toronto Pan Am Games security  to cost $247-million   How is this covered and by whom? Seem outragous to me.  Another question, as I have tried to find it and cant.  Where the events are held. Like say, Hardwood Hills in Oro Medontie. Do all ticket sales or partial of the funds, go to the event holder or township?"
924723,Toronto_Angler,2015-07-14 16:33:00,698,Don't see anything wrong with people criticizing  a sports event (not even olympics) that will cost 2.5billion of our tax dollars (if it was private funding my views would change) when homeless levels last june were at a record high. Think they are more important areas we can be spending public money and it is my right to question that instead of blindly supporting this event.
924724,Pickeral eater,2015-07-14 16:35:00,155,"Well I'm one of those civil servants you speak of.  I did work yesterday and am picking up a shift today.  I'm there to provide medical care for injured athletes as its mandatory in order for the games to go on.  I work along with doctors, physiotherapists and chiropractors in the medical outposts.  I guess I feel a little offended from some of the comments I have read but at the same time I'm not shocked.  Many times I work for an uncaring and uneducated public until we are needed.  Am I saying that all the monies spent are justified? Absolutely not but let's not paint every everyone with the same brush."
924734,irishfield,2015-07-14 17:16:00,26272,Well I know my youngest wasn't too happy about having to push her sister half way across down town in a wheel chair to get from $30 parking to the gymnastics event in the Coliseum last night. They wouldn't even let her drop her at the door and then go park... after that they enjoyed what they got for $77.50 ($50 accessibility + 27.50 assistant seat)
924736,fishing n autograph,2015-07-14 17:21:00,2540,"I am too. I walked 12.4km sweeping angus glen. It wasn't fun.  Security cost that much because there are six police services working 24/7 for the entire games plus a private security firm. In a perfect world security wouldn't be necessary however, with all the extreme left wing groups threatening to cause havoc, different groups world wide wanting to make statements and the fact that athletes and visitors from all around the world want to feel safe, security is necessary."
924749,ketchenany,2015-07-14 19:21:00,3229,Did you find any golf balls?  I'm working on the ad campaign right now.
924751,fishing n autograph,2015-07-14 19:37:00,2540,plenty lol
924752,SirWhite,2015-07-14 19:49:00,210,I'm seeing lots of scalpers downtown. Should be easy to get
925008,Mike Pike,2015-07-16 15:16:00,1332,"Went to see women's soccer last night in the Hammer.  Pleasantly surprised to find that the ticket price included two games!  At 5:30 we saw Brazil decimate Ecuador and at 9:30 Canada played Costa Rica( and unfortunately lost ).  Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  It's was a great evening and the staff and volunteers were very organized and accomodating, getting us to the stadium and through the concorse and to our seats.  Really surprised at how friendly and professional everyone was.  The Tiger-Cats could learn a few things about the fan game experience from this crew."
925050,FloatnFly,2015-07-16 23:25:00,1640,"Got tickets this afternoon for Saturday Nights semifinal baseball game, $20 each, can't wait!  have no idea whos playing in it yet"
924093,captpierre,2015-07-10 01:37:00,2521,Thinking of taking in an event. Last minute now. Checked on line Crazy expensive tickets Don't know  now.
924095,irishfield,2015-07-10 01:52:00,26272,"Daughter bought tickets to Monday nights gymnastics, way back in October!"
924096,woodenboater,2015-07-10 01:57:00,2277,"With tickets sales way below expectations, dropping the prices will be a necessity to getting bums in the seat otherwise the tv cameras will need to be selective about what they show. nothing like empty seats to instil booster spirit lol."
924137,Gregoire,2015-07-10 12:21:00,1397,The prices are in line with top flight international competition. It is unlikely that they will drop prices beyond the 20% that was already offered. It is more likely that tickets will be given away. Doesn't make a lot of sense but that is the way it works.
924185,Acountdeleted,2015-07-10 16:36:00,2562,"They had the chair of the event on the fan 590 last night. Man, what a used car salesman. According to him, the pan am games will make all of our lives 100% better and we should all be thankful they are here.  Oh. And they proceeds will make everyone rich.  What a joke."
924189,Mike Pike,2015-07-10 16:57:00,1332,I'm gonna catch some soccer here in Hamilton.  Looking forward to it.
924198,cuzza,2015-07-10 17:55:00,467,"Going to the rugby on Sunday afternoon at BMO for $35 a ticket, not really ""crazy expensive""  Most of the arenas are pretty small meaning there's no such thing as bad seats for most events and no need to go for the pricey options"
924199,fishing n autograph,2015-07-10 18:04:00,2540,You'll enjoy the rugby. I was guarding their training venue and watch them practice. Quite interesting
924293,woodenboater,2015-07-11 14:24:00,2277,"wonder why they're playing 7 vs 15 ? I'd be going to Hershey Centre or whatever they're calling if during the Games, for the martial arts. Love me some judo and wrestling"
924304,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-11 16:16:00,4399,with reference to the car salesman comment....in the showroom all the people walking around with Pinocchio like noses are customers....not salesmen. If a salesman is lying to you report him to OMVIC!!!
924308,Steve,2015-07-11 16:28:00,2075,"The prices are in line with top flight international competition.  Whoa, you mean there is going to be some top flight international competition? All I've seen so far is Pan Am games advertised .... not top flight international competition...  unless it the Sham Am games you are referring to as that top flight international competition, lol."
924321,Acountdeleted,2015-07-11 19:48:00,2562,"All I've seen is ads telling me to stay off the roads and to take all my vacation now to avoid traffic.  I'd like to see the wrestling, I just don't have the time or money."
924341,Cast-Away,2015-07-11 21:05:00,790,On my way to gymnastics right now. Free Go Train from Newmarket and free Go Bus home with the tickets. Hi perk eh!
924566,cuzza,2015-07-13 14:01:00,467,"Rugby was awesome, two golds for Canada and I'd say it was top flight level play  and a great value day out (apart from the beer but that was my choice  )  Woodenboater - I guess it's because sevens is a lot less physical than 15s (quick scrums, no real rucks/mauls), I think all teams played 3 or 4 x 15 minute games yesterday so the whole ""tournament"" is over a weekend. Sevens is also a lot more crowd friendly as it's end-to-end.  Like Cast-Away, I took transit for free. Maybe the detractors should actually go before knocking it?"
924613,SirWhite,2015-07-13 18:07:00,210," I disagree, for example just ask him if that's the best price they can do. The next thing out of his mouth is a lie"
924635,Gregoire,2015-07-13 22:15:00,1397,"That comment is ignorant. Besides the elite high level athletes competing at the games, there has also been a large investment in developing sports infrastructure, most of it outside the downtown core. Pick a sport and go out and enjoy it. If you choose not to fine, but please do not add your voice to the rest of the sheep complaining. That is just baaaa d form."
924645,pics,2015-07-14 00:23:00,1268,16 events are qualifiers for the Olympics . My wife was elated to win tickets to the equestrian event..not something I would watch but her and my daughter are very excited.. front row too..
924650,woodenboater,2015-07-14 01:07:00,2277,"was at the aquatics today when we won some hardware. looked iffy for a bit with the women's 10 m but they nailed their last dive to grab the gold. walked over to roller sport speed skating and that was interesting, seems like it's popular in south america judging by the results"
924653,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-14 01:22:00,4399,"and I disagree with you....not saying salesmen don't lie but if we lied as much as customers then we would all likely be in jail....sold a Santa Fe to a guy today and on his trade in the disclosure he said no insurance claims or damage...when we did the car proof what do you know there is a claim of several thousand dollars, when I asked him about it he said he forgot....LOL....if a customers lips are moving there is a good chance they are lying...."

Sorry, didn't know if I didn't agree with you, that made me a sheep.  I guess ""elite"" and ""high level"" have different meanings for different people.  and we'll see how the investments are used upon completion of the games....such as the Milton velodrome. I gave it three years until its re-purposed."
924674,Gregoire,2015-07-14 11:12:00,1397,"Just to clarify, I said you're comment was ignorant, as in lacking valid information and not based on facts. I also said that you are a sheep because you bashed the games seemingly for the sake of being negative, not because you disagree with me. If you were to provide some solid reasons as to why you hate the games, besides the fact that your already long commute has become longer, than you would be adding done thin tintype conversation."
924675,moxie,2015-07-14 11:16:00,1566,"Buy them, Buy many and please buy often. But wait... increased ticket sales could be spun into success and be a catalyst to us landing a first class games like the Olympics which would cost even more than these games will.  Shouldn't they be begging countries to host games instead of countries bidding for them? Sounds Bass Ackwards to me. Anyhow, I hope the athletes get what they need from the games but as far as the games revenue/cost ratio is concerned I only want to see complete FAILURE so they or any other game(s) never set foot here again.   I know I can rain on just about everything but when I see us cheering for games and people in the same city living in increasing squalor, personal bests are truly meaningless.  If all else fails they could give them away at the LCBO with a purchase."

Comments of a public servant for whom the sun always shines on the pot of gold which is the public purse? A lot of people made out like bandits and others will write their names in history while patting themselves on the back for this fiasco of another rotting corpse dumped in a black hole of debt we continue to allow bureaucrats to dig in our name.  Building so called infrastructure for this second rate event while we get stuck with the bill? You Danny are the ignorant one. Since when do we have to host something in order to build infrastructure??? Inane comment and sad if one thinks it should be done this way. If you need it, and it is necessary, build the Damn thing!!!!! Mountain bike courses and velodromes aren't necessary.  In 2011 Guadalajara used the games in order to build much needed infrastructure(Cause they had none) and it cost them $200 Million. Its going to cost us well over $2 Billion. For a track and a couple of swimming pools?  What type of genius thinks this is a good use of OUR money in a flailing economy? That's beyond ignorant.  Better to be referred to as a Tin Hat than a Cement Head."
