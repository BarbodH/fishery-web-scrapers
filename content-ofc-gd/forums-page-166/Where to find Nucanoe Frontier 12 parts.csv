I know I can buy the parts I am looking for off of the nucanoe website but I feel as though, if I place an order, summer will be over before I get it.  For those of you who own a nucanoe frontier, you know those metal brackets that go inside of the track? They are the ones that you can slide back and fourth that keep the bench seats from coming of when you screw them down. I lost all 4 of those.  If anyone knows where I can buy them or has extra I would gladly travel and pay. I'm hopeful that the paddle shack may have what I'm looking for but I'm not holding my breath."

I would just order direct, international shipping is pretty quick, most orders I make from the US are here in a week or less.  I haven't seen another shop carrying nucanoe."

925244,zeeter,2015-07-19 02:39:00,92,I ordered a bunch of stuff directly from Nucanoe. They shipped quickly but i got nailed on duty charges. I heard of the store Outdoors Orientated. They have the fasteners on their website. Never been there.  Let me know how it works out if you go.  http://outdoorsoriented.com/collections/kayak-fishing-accessories/products/yakattack-track-hardware-1
925415,Acountdeleted,2015-07-20 15:34:00,2562,Sweet. Thanks.  Turns out the missus was saying I actually just left the parts in the closet. Made her a deal if she's right I just give her the money for the parts and if she's wrong she'll pay for em. Seems like a win win to me.
