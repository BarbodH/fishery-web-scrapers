925530,BillM,2015-07-21 12:12:00,17367,You didn't get the ownership transferred to you when you bought it?
925532,bigbuck,2015-07-21 12:30:00,2449,Your bill of sale is the title. Your regustration papers are for the liscence # on the bow. Keep both in a waterproof container along with your insurance slip if you have insured your boat.
925573,John Bacon,2015-07-21 18:14:00,3277,"Most people would just use the bill of sale for proof of ownership.  You do get a title of you actually register your boat.  However, very few people register their boats; most just license them."
