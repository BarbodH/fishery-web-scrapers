924697,Pike-stalker,2015-07-14 13:35:00,6,Heading up camping in the Collingwood area next weekend and wondering where is a good spot for pike or bass. I've got a 15' with a 20hp on it so have some mobility. Taking some people who are new to fishing with me and would really like to introduce them to the sport with a bang. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

We should have a sticky about first posts.OFC etiquette is to introduce yourself and share something about your fishing experiences. That being said the harbour and Black Bass Point will produce a few fish but Collingwood is not the greatest warm water fishing destination.

It is what it is.   Lake Eugenia is about 30 min away and has small and large mouths  This was once a great small lake fishery. I enjoyed it some many years ago. Was a great bass lake. The internet has taken care of it not being no longer. Over fished and over pressured now. Yes there are still fish, but nothing like in the late 80.s early 90.s."

Oh ya, what the internet has decimated is beyond belief."
