925719,misfish,2015-07-22 14:41:00,29133,My in-laws stop by unexpectedly sometimes too....    Thats cool Lew. Im thinking thats a second hatch .
925721,SirCranksalot,2015-07-22 14:58:00,3291,Tell them to come back Oct 12---they are invited for dinner!!
925728,Joey,2015-07-22 15:43:00,9122,Get the stuffing ready
925736,Cast-Away,2015-07-22 16:38:00,790,Dit they gobble up the bugs in your lawn Lew?
925740,captpierre,2015-07-22 16:55:00,2521,Very nice. Always amazes me how the chicks survive predation. The adults can fly and roost in trees. But the young?
925753,NANUK,2015-07-22 17:57:00,797,You're very lucky to have neighbors like that ! They look a bit disappointed . You killed their breakfast
925763,OhioFisherman,2015-07-22 19:33:00,6623,"Great! All I see is buzzards, I think they come to check up on me! Is he done yet? LOL"
925781,Beavertail,2015-07-22 21:33:00,331,"The young are very strong fliers, no problem at all getting into trees to roost. They make it look easier than the adults do, after all they are only a fraction of the weight of the adults....any 20lb+ bird has to work to get airborne!"
925789,captpierre,2015-07-22 22:52:00,2521,Ya but I mean when they are real young
925791,Beavertail,2015-07-22 23:04:00,331,"Yeah, pretty vulnerable for the first couple weeks while stuck on the ground. Survival rates go way up once they start flying. I heard some can fly by 10 days."
