925061,kickingfrog,2015-07-17 01:52:00,8333,"Had a frog bait with all the ""legs"" pulled out and came up with this repair/fix and thought I'd share.  I used a pick and 25lb test mono.   I used the pick to pull a loop of line through the legs holes that didn't line-up so that you could just loop the line on its own.    I figured the thick 25lb mono would help not to ""cut"" the line as I pulled the legs through, but was still gentle.    Don't put mono loop in the middle of the legs or you'll have to pull more leg through the frog, just do the 1st third or quarter. Once the legs are through then even them up.    I had turned the hooks around to make it easier, not sure if it really made a difference or not.  Hooks flipped back over and ready to go again.   I might try some crazy glue to help hold the legs in place."

925083,kickingfrog,2015-07-17 14:19:00,8333,You'd recommend gorilla glue over crazy? I haven't used gorilla before.

925143,kickingfrog,2015-07-17 22:52:00,8333,I have some some socks that need mending Rob.  Nice repair   No problem. I'll also sew the holes at the tops as well.
925144,kickingfrog,2015-07-17 23:13:00,8333,This one had much more realistic legs that were pulled off. Used a spinner bait skirt and the same technique. Tried some gorilla glue to hold the legs in place and fill the holes that are a little bigger than on the other one.  
925170,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-18 03:22:00,8243,Brilliant procedure. I love Gorilla glue. I wish they made clear. Do they? I always use too much and it can make a mess but that crap holds anything to almost anything.
