925446,FishOn,2015-07-20 22:44:00,136,"So what if carpets stay wet, boats are made for water. Stick to carpet. This is what trailer manufactures use and boat manufactures approve.  Just my two cents."
925454,Sinker,2015-07-20 23:28:00,8692,Wet carpet rots the wood.
925484,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-21 01:52:00,10439,"Great thread guys. Im off to Home depot to do mine tonight. Problem is that I have to go down to the launch and complete all the work in the parking lot.  Why? I just jacked up the back of the boat and put it on jack stands with 2x6's on top and then jacked up closer to the front and blocked it up on beams. This gave me the room to undo and remove the bunks, repair and replace with out leaving the garage!!!"
925486,FishOn,2015-07-21 02:04:00,136,I do mine when I go fishing. Get the bunks ready  and just change them there. 5 min I am done. They don't rot that fast anyways.

925499,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-21 03:20:00,8243,"I used pressure treated wood and a commercial carpeting that does not have a rubber backer but some type of polymer. I glued and over wrapped then stapled. I didn't even think about stainless staples but I got lucky as they have not rusted so they must be SS.  I saw  the aftermath of a nice new boat with a new 4 stroke that had the plastic like bunks that slid off onto the concrete. Not a pleasant sight, 2 grown men sobbing and curled up into a fetal position. I'll change the PT to cedar when and if it rots. When the cranking gets tough I back the boat back in a few feet and she cranks easily. If I had a larger glass boat and did not have a slip I would go Fish Farmers route, for sure or get a electric winch."
925571,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-21 17:53:00,10439,"Can also crank the tongue jack all the way down and then block up the 2 back corners and crank the tongue jack back up and the boat will come off the bunks then jack the front up a bit and block it. Both will work though   Exactly ho I do it. Jack all the way down, place axle stands with 2X6 blocks under the back of the boat then jack all the way up, block under hull forward and lower the jack to provide enough room to pull the bunks."

924840,Tybo,2015-07-15 14:11:00,1373,"Has anyone use indoor/outdoor carpet for there bunks on larger,heavier boats? An was there any ill affects to the boat. Paint or other wise?"
924858,DanD,2015-07-15 15:46:00,2223,"You probably could get away with regular indoor/outdoor; as long as it doesn't have a rubber backer and it was a tight weave. Have a look at etrailer, they're running some specials on actual bunk carpeting.  http://www.etrailer.com/s.aspx?qry=Trailer+Bunk+Carpeting&furl=-pa-1&ymm=0  http://www.etrailer.com/Boat-Trailer-Parts/Fulton/FCR8012.html  I've order quite a bit of stuff from them; they usually ship USP, so there's no brokerage charge to get gooned by.  Dan."
924864,misfish,2015-07-15 15:59:00,29133,"Hey Paul  The indoor/ out door high quality at Home Depot will work just fine for you. When I redid my bunks on both the tinner and bass boat, it lasted no worries."
924899,msp,2015-07-15 19:59:00,1336,"BPS has it in 12"" x 8Ft. rolls for around $25 . a couple of pressure treated 2x4s and your good"
924906,Bondar,2015-07-15 21:01:00,817,I used home Depot gray indoor/outdoor. No issues yet
924929,Fish Farmer,2015-07-15 23:58:00,2234,  No more carpet for me. Carpet holds the water.
924938,Tybo,2015-07-16 00:33:00,1373,Good stuff. Thanks.
924940,Rob,2015-07-16 00:43:00,467,I just got 2 lengths of plastic decking and used that now for 2 years and no problems at all.  Rob C
924947,DRIFTER_016,2015-07-16 01:13:00,10439,I used Home Hardware grey indoor outdoor carpet on mine several years ago and it's holding up just fine.
924976,wormdunker,2015-07-16 06:50:00,1711,I purchased my plastic (puck board) runners from Fish Farmer 3 years ago.  My 14' Lund slides off very nicely & a lot easier to winch the boat on to the trailer.
925082,mattybculp,2015-07-17 14:03:00,388,That's too funny 2 weeks ago I picked up the grey/black indoor/outdoor carpet at home depot to do the bunks on my trailer .
925171,Tybo,2015-07-18 04:07:00,1373,"2, 10'x 2""x 6"" boards, grey indoor/outdoor carpet,2 tubes of water proof glue. All for 58 bucks. can't beat that."
925173,irishfield,2015-07-18 04:55:00,26272,"Could you do 4 more at 9' 8"" Paul.. I'd prefer black carpet though!"
925188,Fish Farmer,2015-07-18 14:31:00,2234,"Carpet is old school, this is the way to go now, boat doesn't freeze on the trailer, wood doesn't rot as quick, and boat launches and loads easier. Wish I had found this guy years ago. http://www.kijiji.ca/v-boat-parts-trailer-accessories/hamilton/boat-trailer-bunk-glides-made-in-ontario-20-foot-package/597028382?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true"
925200,irishfield,2015-07-18 16:08:00,26272,"Dave how's the paint doing on the hull where you load it?? Just curious if the weight of the boat on the UHWW is wearing it off.  I'm not sure plastic against paint is a great idea for my 3000 pounder, but sure have lots of it around if I decide to go that route."
925202,landry,2015-07-18 16:16:00,1005,"When using plastic instead of carpet, Do u have to keep boat hooked up when launching so it doesn't slide off the trailer onto the ramp?"
925203,Raf,2015-07-18 16:19:00,3495,same question.
925209,Pikeslayer,2015-07-18 17:12:00,1443,"I got the 4' puck boards off of Fishfarner (thx again) & had enough to do 2 x 8' on the runners. On second thought, I wasn't comfortable with reduced friction the full length of the 8' runners when towing, braking or launching. So I decided to run 4' of board + 4' of carpet. I only need the 4' of board @ the front end of the runners when power loading the boat (21' Sylvan) anyways. The 4' of carpet gives added friction to help prevent the boat from sliding under tow, braking & launching. I measured the depth of the puck board & the height of the carpet and calculated how much I would have to rip off the front 4' of runner to end up with carpet & board on equal plane. Here's a pic. The best I could get with the boat on the trailer.    If the winds back down tomorrow, I'll get another few pix."
925210,Pikeslayer,2015-07-18 17:21:00,1443," Paul, I have 2 extra 4' sections of the puck board. There yours if you want them. Power loading is so much easier & safer  My boat is a 21' Sylavn & I can power up with a lot less throttle & more control.   Here's a pik of the hull in line with puck board runners. Not a scratch "
925213,Fish Farmer,2015-07-18 18:00:00,2234,"Good question Wayne, I don't know about the paint being scratched, my Princecraft and Lund have no painted bottoms. As per launching, DO NOT!!! unhook boat till you're near the water or at least transom touching the water  . I love it for power loading when you're by yourself  , I can put it to the winch  . I have noticed my lund will move a little sideways if I turn a sharp corner, my Princraft had keels like Pikeslayers boat above, didn't move at all. Once you get the hang of it, it's great. Roller trailers have plastic rollers, guys have been load glass and tin boats for years. Why the Buck Board, it's 1/2 "" so you can countersink the bolts, I use flat head beveled bolts with a locking nut, all Stainless. My Princecraft trailer had 2X6 boards and my Lund has 2X4, Maybe because Lund bottoms are better Pikeslayer has a good idea if you're worried about movement."
925216,irishfield,2015-07-18 18:42:00,26272,"LOL Dave... my trailer has four 9'8"" long x 2 x 6 bunks."
925221,Tybo,2015-07-18 19:24:00,1373,"Was thinking of using puck-board,Have a sheet in the garage for sliders on the porta-huts. The thing is the trailer has 4 bunks and the inside ones ride on the leading edge of a power stake and the rivets for this rides  on the edge of the bunk. So in time,loading and movement on the trailer will be very hard on the rivets and the edge of the power stake. There is also about 50 rivets that sit on the bunks."
925393,msp,2015-07-20 12:22:00,1336,Great thread guys. Im off to Home depot to do mine tonight. Problem is that I have to go down to the launch and complete all the work in the parking lot.
925433,landry,2015-07-20 17:58:00,1005,What is the best wood to use for bunks? I may redo mine this summer. Thanks.
925445,Bondar,2015-07-20 22:42:00,817,I used cedar 2x6
