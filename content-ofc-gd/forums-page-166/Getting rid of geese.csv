They have a gardener who's spent the last 3 days cleaning up the filth and every morning the mess is back again.  They come up his boat ramp or just fly over the retaining wall.  They've tried everything to scare them away including dogs, noise and even running at them but they just keep coming back for more.  He had the same issue a few years back and killed a couple of the birds with a shotgun and just left the carcasses on the ground and that seemed to scare then away but now he's got some nieighbors not too far away and doesn't want to use a gun again.

Our neighbors lawn hasn't been cut (at the water) in weeks, hasn't slowed them down.  The other neighbor has two dogs but the geese just seem to know when they are out or in the house. Sorry if you got one of the geese I've hit with a pellet but I'm sure not going to let them ruin my property.  The pellets I use are target match pellets so they have a flat face to them, they are desigined not to penitrate so perhaps that is why they bounce off..

I checked TSC down in Peterboro and they have coyote decoys for $60 & $80 so their gonna go have a look at them.  The fireworks is another thought that may work.  They've tried blocking the boat ramp and everything else but that doesn't even seem to slow the birds down.  My bud is 89 years old now so he needs something that doesn't involved alot of running or chasing on his part."

924264,G.mech,2015-07-11 11:15:00,830,"When I was a kid we raised the big white geese for meat on our farm (like 500 of the honking, stinky idiots at a time).  We used to move them around the pasture fields every week so they didn't completely kill the forage.  We contained them by corralling them with a single strand of electric cattle fence about 10"" off the ground.  It was easy to install and move, non-lethal, and fairly cheap (the controller is the only expensive part and you can get a low end one for under 100 bucks at TSC).  If these ones are hiking up from the water and not flying in, this would certainly keep them away.  It doesn't hurt them but is very effective at keeping them on the other side of the wire.  After a couple of days they won't even go near the wire even if it's turned off.  They have little handles you can put on the plastic wire to act as a 'gate' at the boat ramp without zapping yourself or you can just shut it off and move it when needed.  The wire just looks like a piece of string but it has some fine wire strands running through it which carry the power and you just clip it to metal posts with insulators so it's really quite simple to install and move.  Just a thought..."
