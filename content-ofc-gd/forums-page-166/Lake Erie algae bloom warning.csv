924681,OhioFisherman,2015-07-14 11:57:00,6623,Look at what happened in Ohio last year.  http://ecowatch.com/2014/08/03/toxic-algae-bloom-500000-without-drinking-water-ohio/
924686,BillM,2015-07-14 12:37:00,17367,Can we blame the farmers?
924687,AKRISONER,2015-07-14 12:50:00,5558,"honestly blame the United States, Ontario has basically banned the use of most fertilizers specifically for this reason.  Until we learn that a green lawn 400 days of the year is not of pure necessity this will keep happening."
924691,DanD,2015-07-14 13:00:00,2223,"Can we blame the farmers?  I guess we could and make them use an organic fertilizer, which would wash untreated bacteria (Crap) into the water table. Or we could shut the farmers down and buy our fruits and vegetables from countries like India, China, South America, Africa; which all still use DDT as an insecticide? It's a pretty vicious circle.  Dan."
