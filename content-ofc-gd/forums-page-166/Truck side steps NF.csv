924540,Beans,2015-07-13 03:01:00,3339,I saw a truck with home made aluminum running boards recently...I'm sure you could fashion sumpin' like that...  I had to reach over and give Maribeth a hand to pull her up into the cab of my old Ford 150...  I was tempted to carry a kitchen step stool in the truck...You could let her get in first then pick up the stool and toss it in the back...

925053,SBCregal,2015-07-16 23:54:00,688,"whichever way you go, i'd avoid most black or chrome bars.  they tend to be just coated mild steel. if you want the shiney chrome look you should go with polished stainless.  most stainless bars come with a lifetime finish warranty while most chrome/black come with 3yr up here in Canada.  if you're looking to go with black there are a few manufacturers making painted or powdercoated black stainless or aluminum bars.  the aries offroad 4"" big step is a nice step if you're looking for black.  they're a 4"" round bar so you have a nice big step pad and they are aluminum so they wont rust out on you.  aries also makes a nice 4"" oval bar with welded steel endcaps instead of the plastic that most have.  if you have any other questions on this kinda stuff don't hesitate to send me a pm  Ryan"

Im going to hold off til Im back to work and make my own I think. Good solid steel steps . I have use of a plasma cutter, so I can make something personalized."
925086,Lape0019,2015-07-17 14:51:00,647,"Most Canadian Tire stores are keystone dealers and you can order almost anything from them. Other than that, go to a truck accessory place and they can help you out. I prefer oval shaped over round tube for the reasons stated above. I have factory ones on my Sierra and I know you can get a set from Ram so there are a tonne of options for you even though you don' t want to order online."
