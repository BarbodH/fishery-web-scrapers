925161,musky666,2015-07-18 02:37:00,126,"Weigh station at scrap yard or landfill site. landfill is where I had mine done a few years back, need to get the new rig weighed..."
925163,Bondar,2015-07-18 02:45:00,817,Truck stops often have scales 
925166,porkpie,2015-07-18 02:59:00,2521,"Landfill usually does it for free.  If you want a print out of actual weight, they charge a small fee."
925177,fishindevil,2015-07-18 09:49:00,6254,Just curious why would you or need to weigh the boat ? Is it you are having towing issues ? What is the model & make we can probly give you a pretty accurate weight also the manufacturer would have the info on that as well as the motor ? Just wondering ??
925181,OhioFisherman,2015-07-18 11:23:00,6623,"We have a local gravel yard that sells sand and gravel, they have a truck scale. One in your area may have one too?"
925182,spincast,2015-07-18 11:39:00,3279,"MTO weigh scale - assuming you aren't worried about anything covered by the HTA, that is.. If the lights aren't on, stop in and ask em. Or you can give them a call. All the inspections station numbers are available on line."
925185,musky666,2015-07-18 14:04:00,126,"Always good to know actual travel weight of your rig- manufacturers numbers don't always reflect real world conditions- fuel, oil, gear, batteries, motors, travel items ( bikes, luggage, coolers) etc. Yes you can ballpark the numbers....."
925222,Big Cliff,2015-07-18 19:25:00,6899,"Got one done at MTO scales a few years ago, they looked at me kind of funny but did it for me anyway. Truck stop scales are usually certified, they will charge you $15.00 but you do get a certified print out. Scrap yards will usually do it for you for free or for a small fee."

My boat is a 16 ft Deep V fibreglass bowrider boat, an older 1980. When I had the flooring change few years ago, using pressure treated wood as joist , then 3/4 plywood everywhere, flat flooring on top with sub floor, aka bass boat , and plenty of storage underneath, lots of hidden seat on the sub flooring, can sit six, and ski on this as well. I knew it got heavier, so I wanted to just weigh it,  i do not know the actual weight since I own the used boat almost 10 years ago.  Thanks for all of your input. For $15, I do not mind getting it weigh when I go fish and pass to one of the weighing station..  I recently installed some used passenger 145 x80 R12  size tires instead of 5.3x12 trailer tires. Tires got ruined after few fishing trips , where the steel belt hair like wires came out of its side wall. I was not sure if it was the bad used tires I bought, or tires were not rated for my boat weight. or boat too heavy."
