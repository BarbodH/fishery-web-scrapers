Going to be nice actually fishing in it. I start my holidays on Saturday and we are heading up to Big Rideau lake again for a blissful week on the island, love that place. So, all the work on the boat will be able to be enjoyed. Looking forward to posting lots of big Laker pics.  This year I'm predicting a PB in the 30lb range."

Grampa here, on the other hand, has been too busy with his new grandfatherly duties to go fishing. Closest I'm getting to fishing is the fresh pot of ""fish head"" chowder I cooked up tonight."
