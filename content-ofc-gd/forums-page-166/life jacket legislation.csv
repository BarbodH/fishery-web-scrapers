Yet you are in favor of a rule that forces everyone to wear a PFD at ALL times in any boats shorter than 24'.  I actually applaud you for wearing your inflatable at all times.  That is a very responsible and safe thing to do.  More of us probably should do the same and it's good of you to encourage us to do so.  BUT, supporting a law or regulation that FORCES us to wear them at all times is what puts our hackles up.  Forced government regulation doesn't sit well with most folks."
925003,KLINKER,2015-07-16 13:58:00,256,"The question here is what box of cracker jacks did this guy get his PCOC  from, anybody should have known they needed life jackets on board. The thing to do would be to ask the JP for a hundred bucks off if you put it towards a CPS boaters coarse for your son and friends. I think CPS tried to get a boating coarse part of a fine, something like drunk school but they wouldn't go for it.  On BOQ  there was a guy who would take his paddle boat out past the weed line a few feet from his dock for a swim. Cops waited for him to get back on the boat and charged him for no life jacket."

As it currently stands Simon, yes to each their own. The law states you dont have to wear one, so go ahead and dont wear one. If that person drowns because of their own negligence then so be it.  Doesnt mean that my stance on wearing them wavers. Seatbelts are also the law, do people still choose to not wear them? Absolutely. Do i feel horrible when i found out that someone gets hurt in a car crash because they werent wearing a seatbelt, its sad yes but preventable.  I have a friend who died while joy riding drunk with his best friend...tragic indeed, but if i didnt know him id say ""well that was preventable""  Honestly, who here has never..had...known someone or witnessed someone whos had a close call/actually had a problem...i bet very few of us."

924873,AKRISONER,2015-07-15 16:47:00,5558,"do you guys feel like its a tragedy when someone drinks and drives and kills themself? or doesnt wear a seatbelt and dies from a fender bender?  just pointing out how dumb it is. We all do dumb things but when i hear stories of guys out on the lakes not wearing life jackets and falling in and drowing all the time, it makes me think hmm maybe that $150 spent on a good comfortable PFD would be worth the dough?  I guess IMO its not much of a tragedy if it can be very very very easily prevented.  My uncle is a retired search and rescue technician, hes told me outright, 100% of the people that he was able to rescue floating in water were wearing a life preserver.  Ask an OPP officer if they enjoy pulling bodies off the bottom of lakes and informing your next of kin.  cant believe im catching flak for stating common sense."
924881,Terry,2015-07-15 17:19:00,14456,i dont think you can compare them drinking and driving is against the law   and a hazard to others not wearing a lifejacket is not against the law and you risk only your own life  thats like comparing murder and farting

But that would probably be much different if I was fishing lake O or any big body of water.  We use float suits at ice out and my kids arent allowed in the boat at that time(but thats also river fishing with strong currents.  There seems to be some grey areas with COs as well. I got a warning last year on a tiny lake, 20ft from shore in a paddleboat, for no PFD.  Off topic but fishing crappie from a paddleboat is fun???  And lol terry???"

924886,jimmer,2015-07-15 18:19:00,2730,You can't prevent everyone from doing things that can harm oneself; that's called a police state. Most people that operated boats all their lives know when and where a lifejacket should be worn. I believe many of the drowning situations are renters and clueless of the risks involved with boating until it's too late.

There is only one person that is confused about the regulation and he got a $500.00 fine for not having life jackets for his passengers.  I still think this is covered in the handbook you read to take a boaters card test  The last thing I need is another law forcing me to wear a PFD in my boat. All the CO or OPP has to do is sit somewhere and wait till I take it off to apply sunscreen and jump me with a fine"

Im guilty of not wearing a lifejacket, and i've never needed it....because I dont put myself in situations where I would be at risk of needing it.  And, yeah, there is always the risk of something happening, but I could also be killed walking down the sidewalk, so i'll take my chances.  S."
924905,davew3,2015-07-15 20:44:00,430,This discussion got me thinking. You are out on the water and unless you are Jesus you can't walk on it. 
924910,Spanky80,2015-07-15 21:28:00,152,"I copied this from a discussion on another forum:  You are 26 times more likely to die of a fall than by drowning, why don't we have a program to encourage people to wear helmets while on ladders or roofs?You are also 7 times more likely to drown from falling into a swimming pool, bathtub, or other body of water than by boating. Should we ask people to wear PFDs when they are within 6' of water? Should we fence off all water?You are also about 10 times more likely to be killed as a pedestrian or twice as likely to be killed on a bicycle than by drowning in a boating accident. Should we require helmets and body armor?You are twice as likely to freeze to death from natural cold than drown in a boating accident. Should we require people wear jackets?What is acceptable risk? I say all this fretting over wearing life jackets is just stupid. I say it's up to each person to weigh the risks and decide for themselves and certainly not up to some condescending finger-wagging ninny or cubicle dwelling bureaucrat what gear I wear on any given day.  Agreed!  This fishing season, I decided to start wearing a PFD whenever the motor is running, during the cold-water period.  Not interested in wearing one in 25-30 degree weather.  My personal choice...we already live in a police state, being bothered every time we go out on the water checking for safety equipment while boaters around us on the water and at the launch ramp use no common sense.  We don't need more rules."
924912,misfish,2015-07-15 21:38:00,29133," I think you are generalizing the entire population of us who wear inflatable PFD's  I wear mine literally every time im fishing now.  Honestly you should try them out, they are by far one of the best investments ive ever made when it comes to fishing gear.   I too wear one, BUT, it,s always in the back of my mind, if Im knocked out or pass out, whos pulling the rip cord? I fall or slip in and Im done. They are comfortable to wear, but there is a down side.    to be short, no i dont feel bad when people that I do not know die from doing something stupid.  How about the ones you would know?  You cant have it both ways here.  I would say to the OP. Try to get the fine lowered and get the jackets where all can get to them fast. No need to lose a life."
924913,Fisherman,2015-07-15 21:41:00,7201,"Can't argue with that.  I wear mine, now if I could remember to clip on the kill switch more often."

Actually where do you see a grey area? In this case you legally required life jackets. It's not a grey area just because the CO choose to use his disgression and issue a warning instead of a fine. The next guy may not be as lucky especially if he has an attitude."
924931,manitoubass2,2015-07-15 23:59:00,11391,"I should have worded that better. We both had PFDs they just were not on.  And the grey area is a No pfd law is never enforced around here for non motored vehicles.  Where I was was also where I swim, lol, and i sure as heck dont wear a PFD doing that!"
924932,irishfield,2015-07-16 00:15:00,26272,If you had of had it on ... you wouldn't have needed your flashlight! Figure that one out..
924933,Woodsman,2015-07-16 00:18:00,1286,If you had the PFD's no law was broken in that respect & the CO was full of it. Now did he inspect you for the other required safety equipment? Still not a grey area if they choose not to enforce the law. It's call disgression.
924935,hirk,2015-07-16 00:20:00,571,"I have no doubt more people would die from heat stroke, heart attack etc. should they be forced by law to wear a pfd at all times then the total potential lives saved and doubt the numbers would even be close."
924936,John Bacon,2015-07-16 00:21:00,3277,"I should have worded that better. We both had PFDs they just were not on.   Were they inflatables?  If not, you don't need to wear them; just have them available."

924948,SirCranksalot,2015-07-16 01:21:00,3291,I wear my pfd in my canoe unless it's hot and the water is warm. If I was req'd by law to wear it I'd have to jump into the lake more often just to cool off! I would probably still be OK to take my pfd off while swimming but I'd have to put it on when I got back into the canoe in case I fell into the lake. If this makes sense to you give your head a good vigorous shake!!

Once again, to each his own. If you are on a small lake in the middle of summer and you arent wearing a PFD, then whatever, but if you are on on Lake O by yourself...you might just end up like the body of that salmon fisherman they found a week ago.  I can tell you right now, the number of us on here that have had close calls or at least know someone who has either died or been close to dying from falling in the lake is probably huge.  My uncle has been in a boat where someone fell off and drowned. My dad has fallen off of the boat and was unable to get himself back in by himself.  Lew thats why i think the manual inflatables are a little ridiculous. If you are in a boat crash there is a very good chance you will not be able to pull the rip cord yourself, hence wearing auto inflatables.

924740,irishfield,2015-07-14 17:35:00,26272,Seat cushions haven't been legal since the cold war ended...
924742,davew3,2015-07-14 17:45:00,430,"   FYI  Approvals  Canada  Approved devices that fulfil the legal requirement for lifejackets and PFD's carry an approval label permanently affixed to the device.  In Canada, design and manufacture are tested by the independent Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC) before being approved by Transport Canada, a department of the federal government. Until recently approvals were also given by the Canadian Coast Guard. Many current lifejackets and PFD's carry this Coast Guard approved label and are legal as long as they are in good serviceable condition and fit the person who would be wearing them.  Note: Flotation seat cushions are no longer approved devices.   • Read ""A few words on lifejackets and personal flotation devices in Canada"" (Approvals) Transport Canada - Office of Boating Safety "
924743,Dara,2015-07-14 18:07:00,3052,"Them seat cushions are way too hard to sit on after the boat flips over...especially after a couple of beers...better off with a jacket that you can do up...this information really should be in the much maligned boaters card testing  PS, in Michigan, you have to have a throwing seat cushion along with your life jackets"
924758,Garnet,2015-07-14 20:22:00,2056,"What's the label on floatation cushion say. And if you can make a reasonable argument make appointment with the Justice of the Pease and make your case.  They can throw tickets out and reduce fines.  Most States require a throw cushion and is a way better idea than that floating rope we need, so I kept the cushion and tied the rope to it."

924845,AKRISONER,2015-07-15 14:34:00,5558,"uhhh...see the title of the post. Clearly someone got confused. Yes I will agree that thinking that the pfd seats are sufficient is incorrect, however i dont think theres much question if you just make people wear them all the time like a seat belt.  Im not perfect myself I cant say that I wear a pfd 100% of the time, but im pretty darn close, im also 27, a very strong swimmer and never drink while boating.  I still wear a PFD 100% of the time when the water is 60 degrees or colder.  My point is that its pretty hard to wear a foam seat 100% of the time or any other oddity someone may consider as a PFD.  To anyone that is willing to complain that life jackets are uncomfortable or something along those lines, get an inflatable PFD, i literally forget im wearing mine every time i have it on."
924846,jimmer,2015-07-15 14:37:00,2730,"I sure hope they never make it mandatory to wear life jackets at all times. They are uncomfortable, so people just need to be responsible. I will put it on when travelling in rough water, but would not be a happy camper if I had to wear one in 30C weather with no wind. I surely don't need anymore liberal legislation to look after me. I think your kid should go to the JP and plead ignorance and hopefully get a reduction in the fine and then learn from the experience."
