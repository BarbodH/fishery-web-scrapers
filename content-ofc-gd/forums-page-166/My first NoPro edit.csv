924721,206,2015-07-14 16:06:00,563,I picked up a pair of off shore action cams back in the spring and finally got a few shots with them. I quickly ran them through original gopro editing software and made a quick video. A lot more to it then I imagined....koodos to those who make these cool video's!! Here is my first go....open for critics to respond.. lol Filmed by my daughter while we were fishing the 1000 islands Big Bass Challange a week or so ago...We caught over 20 Bass and a few pike but none big enough to win a prize. our biggest 2 were just over 3lbs the big fish for the 2 day event was 6.93!!
