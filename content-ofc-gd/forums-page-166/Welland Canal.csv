925368,Reel Man,2015-07-20 07:58:00,80,Hey guys.  So the wife and I are moving to St Catharines next weekend.  Our new place is about 5 minutes down the street from the Wellland Canal by the QEW bridge.  Question is:  Is there anything to fish in the canal?  I've read a few widely varied opinions on the subject including a few posts on this site a few years back.  Didn't sound very promising but you never know what a few years can do to a fishery.  Mostly just hoping cause it's so close to home!  Any tips or advice greatly appreciated.  Also any locals who wouldn't mind a couple of new fishing buddies Lela and I are always looking for fishing friends!

Dain City is a popular destination and I've got some decent smallies where it narrows for a train bridge near Port Robinson.  I said recently unused, that was about 1970, recent I guess is defined by your mileage."

After 911, American Homeland Security wanted the entire canal lined with razor wire and armed guards. There are lots of quiet little holes and corners to tackle in the region, with a wide range of species. All within 20 minutes of St Catharines.  Hopefully we can find some time to connect."

There are plenty of carp around and lots of little pike. Never caught anything big there myself. Its not the safest place to paddle around as the water level changes pretty quick, but there was lots of shore spots as I recall.This is going back to 2004-05."

So far was not successful. We heard pike and bass , most reports were carp and channel cats.  Port delhousie has bass , I heard walleye, occational sheepheads at night at the mouth. You have more chance fishing it."

925667,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-22 08:03:00,8243,"I have seen plenty of shore guys fishing the old canal. I know that is not he proper name of it . The fall fishery at Pt, Dalhousie is hot. I have seen cars parked there with plates as far away as Michigan and Ohio. I used to fish Jordan Harbour. We pulled out very nice Large Mouth out of there in the late 80's. Lots of slop and good weed lines back then, now? You will find out. Good luck and welcome to the Peninsula."
