Planning to visit Ottawa and Montreal for a few days then spend a week fishing. Do any of you fine anglers have any recommendations for a lake with cabins for rent with a boat?  Over the last 3 years we've done  Manitoulin Island (twice) Lake Nippising  Those locations are quite far from Montreal, if anyone knows a good spot within 1-3 hours of Ottawa/Montreal, we don't mind to venture out a bit into Ontario but not so far north as Nippising or Manitoulin.  Any suggestions, greatly appreciated."
924337,oates,2015-07-11 20:24:00,151,I've come across White Lake? Anyone know much about it?  http://www.whitelakeon.com/iwhere.html#Cabins
924342,mike rousseau,2015-07-11 21:35:00,4661,I was on that lake today... Lol
924349,oates,2015-07-11 22:36:00,151,"Awesome, would you recommend it? Know any people up there renting cottages/boats?"
924356,Fishwilly,2015-07-11 23:50:00,206,White lake is mostly a bass lake . Don't know of any guides there. Cottages to rent a plenty though.
924388,mike rousseau,2015-07-12 01:45:00,4661,It's a nice lake with lots if room on a busy day... We had a tough day and we still got about 15 largemouth bass... 6 pike and a walleye... And we finished around 2pm... The bass we got were smaller 1.5-2lb mostly... But fun on light gear...  I would recommend it for a trip...
924392,smitty55,2015-07-12 02:10:00,928,Check out Cedar Cove resort. New owners did some good renos and spruced the place up a lot. Adam has also started a small guiding/outfitter business the last couple of years. They have all you want and are in a protected bay for those real windy days. Not too far to the deepest part of the lake. Plus a good restaurant. Like Mike said the lake is heavy with those clones but there are big bass there along with tons of pike and a decent Walleye population. Also known for having good sized Perch but mostly targeted in the winter. It's a nice lake.  Cheers

924491,oates,2015-07-12 20:36:00,151,"Thanks for the help guys, I think the chevruilblanc.com location is a bit out my price range but it looks awesome.  I've contacted 5 or 6 locations in White Lake, Cedar Cove is booked out all summer (sign of a good place). Just checking google maps, so I've moved over to Golden lake too? Anyone know it?"
