706115,fishnsled,2012-06-15 14:49:00,3520,Awesome report!! High teens for sure.
706117,torco,2012-06-15 14:54:00,656,Wow great pics...no idea on the Laker what a beauty.
706321,Spiel,2012-06-16 13:43:00,9065,Solid report Jason and solid fish!  I would concur with those who figure that big trout would be high teens.
706353,Joeytier,2012-06-16 18:05:00,3990,"Some amazing specimens!  As for the laker, I would place it in the 20 lbs class, if not higher personally!"
706001,Basskicker,2012-06-15 03:11:00,421,"Haven't posted in a while, so I thought I'd throw together a short report.  Fished a lake near Manitouwadge last week and caught a few nice big fish.  There was so much wildlife in and around the lake.                          So just how big is this laker?  Never had a chance to weigh or measure, it was quite the ordeal getting him to the boat!!!             Jason"
706002,Moosebunk,2012-06-15 03:15:00,3970,"Great picture loaded post Jay!  You're certainly enjoying the outdoors out your way.  Gonna guess on the laker (and it's a fatty) somewhere high teens, maybe 20???  You didn't measure it all?  It's a heckuva fish man!"
706005,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-15 03:23:00,2690,"Great post Jason!!!  I'm with bunk, high teens.  Love the gators and bears.  Man I can't wait to get north again!!!!!"
706006,Rod Caster,2012-06-15 03:27:00,5784,Worthy of its PB status!
706007,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-15 03:28:00,10439,Hard to get a really good judge by those photos but I would say 16#-18#s.
706008,Stoty,2012-06-15 03:33:00,2910,"Some gorgeous shots there!! I'm not a laker guy, so I'm not gonna guess, but its a beauty fish none-the-less! What lens did you use for those shots?"
706010,Live2fish85,2012-06-15 03:38:00,1633,Awesome Report. Those a re some beauty pics and fish.
706011,funfishing,2012-06-15 03:38:00,147,"Very cool report, nice shots"
706017,adempsey,2012-06-15 04:09:00,1498,Those are some nice looking fish!  That laker is one fat pig!  I really think this is a great photo:   Thanks for the report.
706036,Broker,2012-06-15 09:47:00,482,Great pictures
706038,spincast,2012-06-15 09:55:00,3279,"Congrats on the PB, that thing's a tank."
706039,Roy,2012-06-15 09:59:00,13728,"Wow, all very healthy specimens and some great release shots. Those bears don't look too scrawny either. As for the laker, that would have been my PB as well but I couldn't hazard a guess. Thanks for sharing."
706040,solopaddler,2012-06-15 10:01:00,8605,"Wow, some pretty nice fish there bud."
706052,Jacob,2012-06-15 11:05:00,186,"Thanks for the report, what a laker, way to go!"
706080,johnnyb,2012-06-15 12:49:00,3413,"Beautiful pics....looks like paradise!  Fantastic laker as well.....my jealousy says 15lbs, but I'm sure it's more like 18    Congrats....that thing's a monster!  I've found the length/girth formulas to be pretty accurate over the years, especially for lakers...I don't even know where my scale is anymore...just get the measurements.  But kudos for not worrying about that stuff and getting it back in.  Heck, just tell everyone it was a 20 pounder, you earned it!"
706084,fishindevil,2012-06-15 12:57:00,6254,"now thats a tanker of a laker !!!!   im thinking close to 20lbs !!! huge for sure,great pike too,and lots of scenery and wildlife   thanks for sharing !!!"
706086,Raf,2012-06-15 13:00:00,3495,"nice fish  you've graduated from those panfish, you can remove the ""B"" from your name now."
706092,iFish4real,2012-06-15 13:18:00,386,"Impressive...good job fishing and very nice pics, thanks!!!"
706094,jigsnreels,2012-06-15 13:26:00,133,Pushing 20 for sure.  Congrats and great pics!
706098,Grimace,2012-06-15 13:39:00,2020,A great bunch of fish and photos.  How did you catch that big I one?
706101,Basskicker,2012-06-15 13:54:00,421,"A white tube jig in 52ft of water.  I actually watched the fish hammer the jig on my lowrance,  it made 4 runs back down to the bottom before we cradled him."

706103,Jds63,2012-06-15 14:01:00,1365,"beauty fish , those are some chunky pike too  the laker i would say hi teens as well"

706107,Joey,2012-06-15 14:20:00,9122,"Really great report and pictures, that is one fat laker.  Congrats on the PB!"
