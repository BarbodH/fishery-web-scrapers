I managed to catch a half dozen nice browns (10-13"") from the each of these small creeks I visited. I would translate those browns to be about the same as a 20"" fish from the Credit.  Average depth, 1ft.  Average width, 6ft.  I also managed to land a few nice resident rainbows from these creeks as well (12-14"").  As usual, I was spin fishing my ultralight setup, with my favourite lure selection(s).  I really like the picture below showing two specimens from different small creeks. 1) Because they were delicious and 2) Because the markings are so different.  Tightlines.  Oh and I managed to find a new creek with some nice brookies. No pictures of those because they show too much background unfortunately. Next time I go back there, I'll take some more pics!       "
706721,BillM,2012-06-18 00:46:00,17367,Naturals or stocked?
706722,Rod Caster,2012-06-18 00:47:00,5784,Beautiful markings indeed. I've never eaten a brown. Are they as good/similar to brook trout in flavor?
706738,GreenCanada,2012-06-18 01:26:00,375,"Brown's taste really good. I find they taste very similar to rainbow trout, but not quite as good as brook trout. Brook trout are by far my favourite eating trout, but brown trout in the 8-14"" range are really flavourful and firm.  To my knowledge, I expect most if not all of the fish I caught in these streams are naturals. I haven't read any stocking reports close to these particular areas that would indicate otherwise.  Hiking and fishing. Doesn't get much better."

706852,Joeytier,2012-06-18 15:55:00,3990,Those little brownies are super fun to catch.  Nice going!
706869,jigsnreels,2012-06-18 16:26:00,133,Always nice when the scouting pays off with a delicious fish dinner.  Great pics.
706891,Mike Pike,2012-06-18 16:54:00,1332,"Some of my favourite trout fishing trips include a nice plate of pan fried trout at day's end.  Salt, pepper and dusted in flower, then fried 'til golden brown in butter.  Don't get any easier or tastier."
