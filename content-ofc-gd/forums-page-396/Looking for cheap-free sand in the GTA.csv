706315,Master of Bait,2012-06-16 12:59:00,196,"Hi folks,  Just checking in to see if anyone has any leads on where I can pick up free (or cheap/wholesale) sand.  I've seen a few ads on craigslist and kijiji but I was too late.  Trying to fill a sandbox for my boy.  Thanks,  MoB"
706331,Garnet,2012-06-16 15:23:00,2056,Head down to Lake O. Maybe not Ashbriges Bay but Frenchman Bay or a dozen other spots.
706357,Spiel,2012-06-16 18:43:00,9065," That'd work, not clean sand and I'm pretty sure not legal either. Just saying."
706364,woodenboater,2012-06-16 19:26:00,2277,"I'd pass on the beach sand not the least of which is the point Spiel brings up re:legality. There may also be the matter of cleanliness of the sand, too many geese and gulls basically  For a child's sandbox, I'd find proper, clean sand and I would think any place that sold aggregate would be able to fill your order for cheaper than HD or Cdn Tire ($4 per 18kg bag)."
706366,aplumma,2012-06-16 19:37:00,6896,Check with a few landscaping companies and see were they buy it from it usually is bulk load and cheaper than bagged.   Art
706371,Sinker,2012-06-16 19:55:00,8692,"Look for a place that sells bricks and you should find sand. I know a few places out this way, but its probably too far. I could fill a truck for free if you were close enough and own a shovel!  S."
706424,Grimace,2012-06-16 23:20:00,2020,"Brick sand is beautiful for sand boxes.  Most construction sand is garbage for sandboxes as it turns very hard like concrete after a rain.  Not brick sand though, brick sand is almost as nice as a Caribbean beach."
706431,Terry,2012-06-16 23:37:00,14456,cats sure like sandboxes
706436,Grimace,2012-06-17 00:08:00,2020,I cover my kid's sand box the minute he is done playing in it.   No cats!  Lol.
706440,Garnet,2012-06-17 00:23:00,2056,"You boys did see free and cheap. The ""legality"" by the time somebody finds somebody to call buddy will be gone."
706484,John Bacon,2012-06-17 04:34:00,3277, So it's okay if he doesn't get caught?
706534,aplumma,2012-06-17 13:50:00,6896,O.K. here is a free and legal source of sand....Sweep it up off the edge of the highway if they put down sand like they do down here on every little snowflake you should have to sweep just a little bit.   Art
706834,capt bruce,2012-06-18 15:03:00,820,"  Same way poachers get away !!! Not good advise , good CLEAN brick sand (the kind you will want your children to play in , remember children will put their hands in their mouths even if covered in things i.e. sand and dirt) is not very costly , probably less than a spool of power pro , some senkos and and a cheap combo ."
706847,Harrison,2012-06-18 15:44:00,2202,"Arnts Landscape supply in Pickering/Whitby.  You can bag your own, pretty cheap and clean.  The free stuff you see is probably from guys re-doing old landscaping and need to get rid of it."
