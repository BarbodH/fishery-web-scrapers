I have a 100 dollar gift card for bass pro that I would like to use but bass pro is a hour and a half away so by the time I drive up there my 100 bucks is more like 50 with gas. I have been looking on the bass pro site and have seen 2 that I like one is a bit big I think its a ""ascend ms 3300"" the other is "" ascend 3000dx"" seems like it would fit the bill wondering if anyone had any suggestions I would like one with a frame of some kind the would keep the cargo from digging in my back"
