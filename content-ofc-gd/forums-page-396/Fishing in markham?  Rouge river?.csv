616255,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-27 19:45:00,130," I fished it years ago. Brown trout, rainbow trout, small mouth bass (if they dont swim out to lake) Salmon, carp. I even caught a pike and saw an eel there. A record brown was caught out there many years ago.  I have been as far north as Steeles on it (carp carp and more big carp) I fished down from the Toronto Zoo and would walk from there to hwy2 and always wanted to fish up in the markham area but I think that it may not be so good up there.  I would not eat anything from it."
706617,wask,2012-06-17 18:03:00,174,Thanks for the reply on this and the pms guys - anyone else have any insight into fishing in Markham?  I live near the hospital near 9th line and 7.  Thanks! Hope it was ok to dig up this old thread.
