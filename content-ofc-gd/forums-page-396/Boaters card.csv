705768,lew,2012-06-14 14:11:00,12766,Here's the new boat the OPP will be using in the Kawarthas.  21' Boston Whaler with a 300 HP Merc.  You won't be outrunning these guys Ernie   :lol:  http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/1358289--peterborough-county-opp-buy-new-motorcycle-and-boat
705770,woodenboater,2012-06-14 14:17:00,2277,shoulda seen the RIB's used during the Huntsville G20...some serious heaviness going on in a nice stealthy black
705787,jedimaster,2012-06-14 14:54:00,3472,"I got asked for a boaters card once. The same day I got a ticket for having the wrong color reflective boat numbers on my lund... installed from the dealer... Red boat. Silver backed sticker with red letters. Clearly visible and reflective too. anyway. 125 dollar fine or something like that. Went to court for that one and got off. out of anger I kept the stickers and painted the boat for the picture I brought in. Stickers have since been replaced though. Fishing licence was asked for a small handful of time, hunting license or tags, never, gun licence, never, gun reg certs, never."
705819,blarg,2012-06-14 16:27:00,289,"Ive been checked 5-6 times in the last 5 years, checked everything else, but never asked for the card."
705822,ecmilley,2012-06-14 16:31:00,2163,"must of been the property tax increase this year to cover the cost, really a bosten whaler for the kawarthas is serious overkill and a waste of our tax dollars. as for out running it if they can follow where i run at 60mph they can lay all the charges they want"
705886,Hud,2012-06-14 19:27:00,140,got stopped on the Ripple.  CO asked me for my fishing liscense.  I offered to show boaters card and he said nah that was more of an OPP thing. thought ok whatever you want to see....
705914,mike rousseau,2012-06-14 21:27:00,4661,"  and its people like you that make the card a joke... for every boater that gets a ""friend"" like you to take the test... thats another uneducated weapon on the water that may hurt or kill my family...  thanks champ..."
705924,Steve,2012-06-14 21:57:00,2075,"MM, if that concerns you, what about the 1000's of anglers who simply paid for a PCOC license, never even opening a single test book / website.  Didn't even have to pay an inflated amount, just simply paid, and card send to them via email until the real one arrived.  Two of the folks who offered this service are members of this very board."
705929,ehg,2012-06-14 22:10:00,2666,Have been checked a few times. Last time was on Head Lake near Norland. The CO was in about a 14 ft. boat with 30 hp Mercury.  Nice guy but no one would get away on this smallish lake.
705931,mike rousseau,2012-06-14 22:33:00,4661,   yes and no...  i believe its the government wanting money...  but on the other hand i have friends that knew nothing about boating safety and they studied and passed... now they have at least some common knowledge... they didnt even know what a buoy was before the test... sure i could have done the test for them... but i wouldnt be doing ANYBODY any favors...
705934,misfish,2012-06-14 22:42:00,29133,"LMAO. I paid 45 bucks for a fake saftey for a car in 79. I dare any old timers, tell me they didnt.   This thread is as bad as the gun reg.   You all give yer heads a shake.    CASH GRAB ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; EDUCATION"
705936,mike rousseau,2012-06-14 22:50:00,4661, i agree the government could probably care less about the education side of it...   but some people that are taking the test and studying and learning... and to this guy... thats sees crazy amounts of stupidity on the water all the time... even if a few people out of a hundred learn a bit... thats better then nobody learning anything...
705955,jedimaster,2012-06-15 00:04:00,3472,"Would you vote for a federal party that instituted a 25 billion dollar program to mandate boating tests done by the federal govt, where you had to apr in person at service canada to get your learners boat permit, then take an in person hands on boating test? If 50 bucks shuts the anti's mouths then so be it. I would bet the liberals would try and sneak that one in for sure.  Let the official flame wars begin."
705966,kickingfrog,2012-06-15 00:26:00,8333,No point in boatin' if there ain't no fish.
705970,Roy,2012-06-15 00:44:00,13728," There will be no flame wars, trust me."
706013,Stoty,2012-06-15 03:42:00,2910," Too bad that isnt in the test eh! It's amazing how many people have NO CLUE how to use one even with the instructions, lol.  In 2010 during a tournament on Rice Lake, my partner and I noticed a big cruiser smoking quite heavily...we pulled up the minn kota, and booted it over to them, to find their boat was ON FIRE. They had the extinguisher out...but had NO idea how to use it! We had to jump on board, and put it out for them. First and only time I've had to use my Firefighter training so far, LOL.  Imagine if we hadn't showed up and they had to sit and read instructions WHILE their boat was on fire.... what a joke! These are common sense items that people need to know how to use. Could save your life, along with others."
706412,Fisherpete,2012-06-16 22:11:00,1814,"The way I looked at it was this... I really didn't think I needed to learn anything about boating, since I have been driving one since I was 7 or 8 years old... yikes that is now 30 years of experience lol... but I took it seriously, studied the guide hard, and did very well on the test, I think I only got one wrong answer. I did learn a few things, and one day, one of those things might come into play out on the lake.  My wife does not have her card yet, and wants me to get it done for her online - but I refuse. I really want her to read the guide and do the test herself as she does not have any on the water experience with a motorized craft. You get out of it what you want to... take it seriously and it can only be a good thing. The same goes for my 13 year old - if he wants to drive my boat, he has to do the test first, the right way.  If everyone took the same approach, maybe there would be a few less of those jetskiiers whizzing 10 feet past the end of our dock on Rice while the kids swim there (one was nearly killed a few years back when he lost control...)  To those parents who just do the test for their kids...  Oh, and in response to the original question... I have been stopped 4 times, once they checked my safety gear, the rest they just asked how the fishing was. Never asked for my fishing licence or PCOC."
706517,Fish Farmer,2012-06-17 12:57:00,2234,"Buddy got stopped on Quinte on the opener and got charged $125.00 for not having his card on him. He left it in his other boat clove box, was the wrong answer.  He does have one. I haven seen any difference since they brought out the card thing. Made a few people richer"
706526,SlowPoke,2012-06-17 13:15:00,2984," Government doesn't profit from the operators card, it costs them money. This system is about optics; they're showing they care at the least expense. Not far off the Drive Clean program in Ontario.  I was asked to produce my card this spring to Niagara Regional Police. First time since I obtained it."
706677,mikdor,2012-06-17 22:47:00,109,I got checked in the Marten River area on Friday and that was the first thing they asked for. mikdor
706884,fishermccann,2012-06-18 16:46:00,655,"I think that it is to prevent people from claiming ignorance of the law as a defence, "" but you passed the test"". Guilty."
705422,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-13 16:21:00,1107,I am just curious has anyone EVER been asked to show there card ? I get stopped on longpoint bay the OPP and CO's atleast 2-3 times a year (I think they like me LOL) but have never been asked for it I even asked them if they would like to see it and they said no .So who has had to show their Boater card.  The other thread got me thinking about this and I didn't want to hijack it
705423,Millhouse2020,2012-06-13 16:25:00,152,I have had the same experience.  Stopped many times in the west arm of Nippissing but they never asked for my card.  Just wanted to verify if we had life jackets and safety gear and confirm no alcohol in the boat.
705427,whiskywizard,2012-06-13 16:52:00,305,"Mixed bag here, some cops want to see it and some don't.  I was boarded by a joint task force in the Niagara River, just south of Lewiston.  A fast RIB with 1 Coastie, 1 Niagara Region cop, and 1 Canada Customs agent. They wanted the PCOC. Metro Toronto Harbour police always ask for the PCOC but, ironically, never ask for the (required) Harbour licence. Was boarded by 2 RCMP in Lake Ontario, about 5 NM south of Toronto.  They wanted ID, any kind would do, and vessel registration papers.  I offered the PCOC instead of real ID. Whenever my kids are stopped (from their teen years to now as young adults), they're always asked to produce PCOCs."
705428,NAW,2012-06-13 16:57:00,4022,"I was in my canoe loaded with camping gear, and a big dog.  Got stopped.  He asked for my card.  I told him it was in my wallet, in the bottom of my bag, at the bottom of my canoe.  I would have had to gone to shore, unpack everything.  He trusted me, and didn't make me dig it out.  He went down the river further, and busted my budy for not having the correct safety gear."
705447,kickingfrog,2012-06-13 17:59:00,8333, Did you have a motor on the canoe?
705450,John,2012-06-13 18:06:00,2956,"Usually get stopped on West Arm at least once a year. License, Boaters Card, Lifejackets, safety stuff.....yadda yadda...Usually nice guys and gals but they can't handle a boat to save their lives........."
705468,NAW,2012-06-13 18:55:00,4022, Oh ya.  Forgot to mention that.  Electric trolling motor.  That's why I had all the gear and dog.
705470,strik,2012-06-13 19:08:00,175,was asked  last friday   on lake huron  ..  They were nice  to deal with
705489,Jacob,2012-06-13 19:40:00,186,"Last year i was stopped three times, they wanted my card, registration and safety stuff.  It might be because of my age though, my grandad was stopped and they just wanted safety stuff.  Jacob"
705523,Joey,2012-06-13 20:31:00,9122,"  Agreed, very bad at that whenever they pull us over up there!!!!"
705548,krixxer,2012-06-13 21:56:00,274,in my first boat on the first day out within the first hour  and never since
705572,Bernie,2012-06-13 23:13:00,3190," Ya, the last time they stopped by me up here they tried to get close. Thought they were going to damage my boat. I said never mind,  I'll come to you. Never did ask for my boaters card....Imagine that, wonder how they got theirs? HA!"
705644,Sinker,2012-06-14 02:24:00,8692," No kidding. I had them nearly sink me on lake simcoe a couple years ago. They pretty near ran right over my boat. Water came in over the gunnels. I LOST IT! They didn't even check my safety gear, or ask for my PCOC. They just apologized and carried on. I was PISSED, and asked them for theirs. They didn't like that too much!!!  I've never been asked for mine. Kinda like my gun license, and boat registration. Been checked many, many times, but never asked for it. One time had 6 cruisers pull into a field we were hunting, with a swat team on the main road. They still didn't ask for our gun licenses!! The landowner snapped on them for driving all over his field and they left with their tails between their legs!!  S."
705645,Mack66,2012-06-14 02:25:00,19,I got stopped twice in one day on scugog. Once by opp and once by Durham region I think. They didn't even know they we're out there at the same time.
705646,Mack66,2012-06-14 02:26:00,19,Forgot to mention both asked for pcoc
705672,Stoty,2012-06-14 04:20:00,2910,"Yup, I was asked for it on Quinte last summer.  Agreed about them not being able to drive a boat.... I had to KICK their boat away from mine before it hit me..... Def thought about asking if he had a card... but wanted to get back to hammering some GOLD instead of them breaking out the ""rubber glove""! LOL"
705704,ecmilley,2012-06-14 10:56:00,2163,"on sturgeon 2 times i have been stopped by the opp in 9 years living here, one time was to say hello never checked for anything other than a floating flashlight polite and seemed to be able to drive the boat, other time was 2011 chashed me from emily creek to snug harbour area and they were pissed that i didn't see them or couldn't catch me they checked everything 3 times looking for something wrong was accused of doing a u-turn to avoid them for whatever reason after 20 minutes that other site there search they left and were even more anniyed when i suggested they get a faster boat. also one episode on scugog years back I'll let fishindevil tell you about that"
705705,lew,2012-06-14 11:13:00,12766, That wouldn't have gone  over too well I'll bet   :lol:
705707,mike rousseau,2012-06-14 11:22:00,4661,Never had my boaters card checked...  Never had my livewell checked...  Never had any storage compartments checked...  Never asked for any ID to prove I am the same person on my fishing license...  Never had my bait checked...      Only ever been checked for fishing licenses...life vests... And safety requirements....
705708,Roy,2012-06-14 11:24:00,13728,I have never been asked for my boater's card. The place I've been stopped the most often is the West Arm of Nipissing. Never asked for the card there either. Always polite and smiling though. It's good that they're getting the job done. I kinda wonder about the cards though.
705709,Stoty,2012-06-14 11:25:00,2910," I always wondered why they run 16ft boats with 60HP on it..... For example, if someone were breaking a rule and they noticed the MNR coming their way...what would stop someone with a 150/175/200/225/250, to simply outrun them?  You don't see cops driving honda civics.... they have impala's with supercharged Vette engines...."
705712,mike rousseau,2012-06-14 11:38:00,4661, Lol  Really...16 footers...lmao  Our cops are jacked to the max here...  20+ foot zodiac boats with large twin outboards for RCMP...They have 3 I think...  Opp on 1000 cc sea doos.... As well as a large boat... Forget how big...but it's a good size boat...  And MNR is rocking a Boston whaler with a 225 If I remember correctly...
705718,Stoty,2012-06-14 11:47:00,2910,I've been stopped twice in my life and both times they had 16ft tinnes with 60HP on it....
705745,smally21,2012-06-14 12:55:00,993,"never been asked for the card. the boats in hamilton, temagami and lake erie i get checked by aren't tin cans they are serious twon outboard machines.  alcohol seems to be their major concern. searching, searching, open this, show me in here.  whether they find anything or not they ALWAYS provide some sort of lecture..the last one was ""the hardest part of my job is pulling bodies out of the water"" so i interrupted him and asked how many bodies he'd pulled out of the water.  the guy didnt say anything and his partner chimed up that neither of them had ever pulled a body from the water or even seen one.  which was ironic considering the guys in the boat he was lecturing had seen plenty."
705761,Slop,2012-06-14 13:53:00,151,"I was checked out just last week. I asked the officers what percentage of boaters stopped, were not in compliance. They did not have a number but said it was quite low. They did say that alcohol offences were through the roof."
