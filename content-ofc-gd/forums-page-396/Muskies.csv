I have been out a few times in the past year and a bit. Out only once this year. I joined the local muskies club here in southeastern PA and they do a whole lot of cool stuff, like raising money, stocking fish, fish rescues (rescuing muskies that get swept over a damn in to small creeks), lake clean ups, etc. I got to fish some  interesting lakes and rivers here in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Susquehanna and Delaware rivers are really beautiful. I have yet to catch a river fish which is my next goal. I miss fishing for muskies in ontario. I will be coming back in July for the month and will be fishing Nipissing, the Kawarthas and Georgian bay. Here are few of the muskies that I have caught down here south of the border. Nothing huge, but still pretty fun. This one lake that the muskie club has been stocking now for 6 years is doing really well. The fish are up to 42-43 inches and many people are catching our fish. Although the bass clubs hate our muskies and are complaining that the muskies are eating all the bass. I had a great day last year when a front was coming through and I managed to catch 3 fish (38,35 and 32)in 2 hours and 2 fish were on back to back casts which was pretty nice. At the time these fish were only about 3-4 years old. We have some nice tiger muskies in our lakes but I think they are harder to catch then the pures. I have caught a few in the spring and they are really pretty.      "
