706059,limeyangler,2012-06-15 11:49:00,5204,"Hi all,  I've had some time off work and spent my time with family and friends and of course lots of fishing. In fact i have 7 or 8 reports to post....so i’ll get started with last weekend’s  fishfry.  WE TOOK JACK TO SEE THE OLD LUMBER TUGBOAT IN THE MORNING, HE'D BEEN BUGGING TO GO SEE IT FOR WEEKS!                           THEN I HEADED OUT TO GET SOME FISH FOR A FISHFRY THE NEXT DAY   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/jHQUutXcCl8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                               WITH ENOUGH FISH FOR THE NEXT DAYS FISFRY I HEADED HOME AND WATCHED THE SUN GO DOWN IN THE BOAT WITH MY PUP                     The next morning my wife's uncle and my good fishing buddy Cliff and his daughter came to help build the swing set we bought for Jack.  Thanks you everyone for the suggestions/advice given for a GPS choice when i asked a month ago,  but i spent my hard saved cash on the swingset and sacrificed the Garmin....I spoil that child! Anyway, for my hotspots i pretty much have them memorized better than any hard drive....and use the rock/tree/rocky point triangulation method! NEXT YEAR!    <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/_f9IIRdl_N8"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>       MY WIFE'S UNCLE HARD AT WORK, CLIFF WAS ALSO PRETTY HANDY TO HAVE AROUND.        JACK HELPED TOO, BUT SPENT MOST OF THE TIME PLAYING WITH CLIFF'S DAUGHTER            FOR ONCE I FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS AND DID AN INVENTORY THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THERE WERE SO MANY SEPERATE PIECES PROGRESS THE FIRST DAY WAS SLOW BUT STEADY                        WE ALSO FOUND THE PERFECT SHADED SPOT BEHIND THE HAMMOCK AND CLEARED THE AREA OF OVERHANGING TREELIMBS.            THAT EVENING CLIFF, HIS WIFE AND 4 KIDS AND MY NEW BUDDY SCOTT JOINED MY WIFE AND ME FOR A FISHFRY.  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Cgb9nPJQkpY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>       FOOD AND COMPANY WAS GREAT....KIDS HAD FUN TOO                          AFTER THE FOOD AND CHATTER WE HELD A MINI FISH DERBY, AND DESPITE KEEPING THE KIDS ENTERTAINED WITH A CRAYFISH HUNT, CLIFF FINALLY JOINED IN AND WON BRAGGING RIGHTS WITH 2 FISH! I GOT ONE, AND SCOTT GOT THE WOODEN SPOON.                         AFTER A BRIEF AND PRIZELESS DERBY, AN UNPLANNED CASTING CLINIC WAS HELD FOR THE KIDS BEFORE EVERYONE HEADED HOME.                 THE NEXT MORNING I WAS UP AT 5AM SO I COULD ORGANIZE ALL THE PIECES OF THE SWINGSET ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTION SEQUENCE.                     SOME OF THE MORE TECHNICALLY GIFTED MAY BE THINKING...""SO WHAT!""...BUT IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND PRETTY USELESS AT ANYTHING MORE TECHNICAL THAN SCREWING IN A LIGHT BULB......DEFINITELY WORTH THE HOUR SPENT DOING SO AS CONSTRUCTION TO NEAR COMPLETION TOOK UNDER 3 HOURS ONCE WE STARTED....                         JACK LOVES IT!!!! WELL WORTH NO GPS!                                 AFTER NAP AND SUPPER THE WHOLE CLAN WENT DOWN THE LAWN FOR AN EVENING CRAYFISH HUNT/ FISH/RELAX SESSION...BEAUTIFUL EVENING BY THE LAKE!                                   Great start to the weekend and the next few days saw some excellent fishing too......  reports to follow....but its 6:42am on Friday morning and i am going fishing in an hour for lakers and walleye. More reports to follow.    Tight lines all."
