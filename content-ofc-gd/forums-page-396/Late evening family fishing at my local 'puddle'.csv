Not much to say other than what a nice way to end a day for everyone...especially since mum was at work, Jack had to be at the sitters while i was being prodded with sharp needles in the shoulder, just nice to all meet up and relax outside.          FAMILY OUTINGS ARE JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/RHC25sdHDWA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                       MY FAVOURITE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD      HE HAS HAD HIS STICK FOR OVER A MONTH NOW AND ALWAYS BRINGS IT TO 'PADDLE' WHEN WE GET OUT IN THE BOAT       LOL.....BY THE LOOKS ON THE FACES IT WAS A STRESSFUL,LONG DAY       FISHING IS SERIOUS AND THIRSTY WORK!
