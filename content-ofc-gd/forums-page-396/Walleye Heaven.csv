Got out to a local lake for some walleye action....we were not disappointed.My buddy cliff had been buggin' to get me into this lake....like i need any persuading...so with time off...we went in, jigs and minnows and spinners did the damage.  Fishfly hatch in full bloom here at the moment and we found all the fish on flat muddy areas...i am assuming thats where the larvae hatch from, cuz the ones we filleted were stuffed full of fishly larvae.   We ended keeping only three as we had no measuring device with us so we were only confident that one of the fish we had was under 18"" (limit 4 fish only one over 18 per person zone 5).   I did get a nice 30""er to add a 1/2 inch to team 5's 29.5"" entry......  We laid the fish on the wooden seat, with the tourney sign.....made notches in the wood at head and tail....an measred when we got back...lol...one way to do it...and Cliff has a permanent reminder in his 14' tinny that he still has to get a 30""er!!!!!  He came very close yesterday...but thats another report altogether.    <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/o2LV6Bepdps"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                                    Very grateful to Cliff for sharing his secret lake with me...what an awesome afternoon of walleye fishing."
