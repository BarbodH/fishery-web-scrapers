I have heard the surrounding lakes are good but not sure about Gowganda Lake. Any info would greatly help. Thanks"

We fished the back lakes and the fishing was good to excellent. If you like bass, Hangingstone and Frypan are unbelievable, the access is down a logging road and to get to the boats is steep decline- not bad going down, but a tough slog going back up (it's worth it for the fish). Obushkon has BIG bass and good sized pike and walleye. We never fished Stumpy Lake (terrible access road-not for the faint at heart) but I heard from those who have that the walleye fishing is great. We stayed at Lookout Point Camp. The owners Vicki and Larry make you feel right at home and the camp is spotless! By the way there's no closed season for bass. We went the second week of June last year and the bass fishing was great!"

Frypan was a great lake, we did well for some BIG walleye and pike in there. If you like smallmouth you gotta hit Elkhorn Lake (rough road in but you can ATV or 4x4 it) best bass fishing I've ever experienced."
