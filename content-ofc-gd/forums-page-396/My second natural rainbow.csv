706712,GreenCanada,2012-06-18 00:22:00,375,"Looked like a nice couple days on the water.  What exactly do you mean by natural rainbow though, never really heard that term before."
706715,dave524,2012-06-18 00:32:00,4508,"Don't think that is Hogweed but our native Angelica (Angelica atropurpurea), nice resident bow too."
706723,BillM,2012-06-18 00:47:00,17367," Resident fish, not a steelhead."
706725,Musky or Specks,2012-06-18 00:49:00,2710,I believe what he means is a resident bow. A fish that has lived its entire life-cycle in a stream as opposed to smolting out to the lake to live the majority of its life(anadromous)
706735,GreenCanada,2012-06-18 01:17:00,375,"Ahh, I figured that's what it was. Thanks for clearing that up!"
706752,Sinker,2012-06-18 02:36:00,8692," Your probably right, but better safe than sorry.  Its hard to judge the size of it in the photos, and they look very similar, other than the size.  I still wouldn't go near it, unless I was sure!  S."
706808,misfish,2012-06-18 13:24:00,29133,"The plants were 5-6 ft tall.  Thanks for clearing that guys. By natural,I mean resident."
706820,johnnyb,2012-06-18 14:11:00,3413,"Great looking stuff, Brian...if they're striking short, change up the fly.  I'm always amazed at how hard they hit when you have the right fly on, even though they'll peck away at the wrong one, making you think it's what they want."
706822,BillM,2012-06-18 14:25:00,17367,I would have made a drift or two through that deep section with an indicator and a nymph..  Deadly when the fish are lethargic.
706823,Spiel,2012-06-18 14:28:00,9065,"Sweet looking water Brian and a super nice bow.  But it appears to me that your ""olive caddis"" is an olive stonefly.  "
706828,fishnsled,2012-06-18 14:47:00,3520,    I think you are correct Dave. This site shows the difference between them. I would of stayed clear of it to be safe as well and would do so in the future.  Giant Hogweed Similar Species:   Nice fish Brian!!
706833,Harrison,2012-06-18 15:03:00,2202,"Brian, looks like you found another new passion.  Congrats."
706551,misfish,2012-06-17 14:47:00,29133,"First off,HAPPY FATHERS DAY to my pop and all you fathers out there.  Yesterday,I went for a drive to find some new running waters.Took the fly rod with me. My fly of choice was the olive cadis. Not to small and not too big.    I missed one fish. I couldnt believe I couldnt get fish in these waters. It looked so prime.        Found these little imprints.Little baby deer tracks. Wish I could of seen him/her.    Today I headed back,but to another section of the river, armed with my ultra light,spooled with 4 pound and choice of spinner was,the black w/orange spots,Panther Martin. Quickly I got 2 small smolts.  There was so much beautiful water again.              I hit this one area with fast flowing water. I was rewarded with a nice natural rainbow. Quick pic,and swam away to fight another day.    Had to be back early. Got burgers to make up and salads.Kiddies are coming over for lunch.   All you fathers have a great day."
706554,jigsnreels,2012-06-17 15:03:00,133,"Great way to spend a lazy Saturday.  Nice little rainbow, too!"
706558,Broker,2012-06-17 15:08:00,482,Beauty fish !
706560,ccmtcanada,2012-06-17 15:13:00,7971,Brian...I've been following your stream fishing all year!  Some great waters and fish in all your reports!
706565,Christopheraaron,2012-06-17 15:28:00,3525,Nice!
706566,Jacob,2012-06-17 15:31:00,186,great fish.
706572,misfish,2012-06-17 15:50:00,29133,"Thanks guys. Glad you are enjoying it Cliff. It,s been very educational and soulful.  I came across this cool plant.Anyone know what it is? I took some pics in it,s different stages of growing.      "
706574,bushart,2012-06-17 15:53:00,2628,Careful it's not that hogweed Brian---not kiddin  ps beauty bow
706576,Terry,2012-06-17 15:55:00,14456,great way to spend fathers day even with all the walking
706582,Musky or Specks,2012-06-17 16:12:00,2710,"I wish we actually had a nice river with real resident bows. We almost did, we had a contract with Alberta to bring in bow river eggs for the Grand above Belwood Lake but then whirling disease hit the rockies and that was the end of that I guess now its the odd fish that doesn't smolt out or nothing"
706589,misfish,2012-06-17 16:42:00,29133," Did some research,and it does look like it Terrance. There seems to be a site to report such findings.I sent the pictures off to them and location.   Thanks bud. The walking is so much easier now.It,s the slippery rocks,that get your attention,REAL FAST.      I seen alot of smolts this morning.Many were behind this laying/floating log,that was like a feeder chute,and they were surfacing and jumpimg at small insects. I had numourous hits today as well. This river seems very healty IMO. Im still waiting to get my first reasonable brown still."
706591,Leecher,2012-06-17 16:46:00,7832,"First and foremost, Happy Fathers Day to you too Brian     I too been following your stream side adventures and must say that, for a guy that has been away from it for some time, you certainly are having some soulful times and getting back into the beat along the water banks  Great job on the bow    She's a beaut  Keep them reports coming! Thanks for sharing Jacques  PS.  If you want I can make a little video with your pics... have a good tune to go with it   ELP comes to mind"
706596,misfish,2012-06-17 16:56:00,29133," Thanks Jaq for the kind words.   I have a couple more outing first, before I want to put a vid together."
706598,bushart,2012-06-17 17:01:00,2628,I understand that stuff can ruin your life---I'm always reminding my kids about that one (and deer ticks) when they're in the outdoors
706600,misfish,2012-06-17 17:06:00,29133, Nasty  http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&ved=0CHwQFjAH&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.worksafebc.com%2FPublications%2FMultimedia%2FVideos.asp%3FReportID%3D34980&ei=wg7eT9fNJIj56QH7_Y24Cw&usg=AFQjCNF9bud2HAtde0Yw-vZvyJqvr65_bg&sig2=elNqx4dlJ5iIl6Lo1qd8bA   http://storage.canoe.ca/v1/blogs-prod-photos/6/3/2/6/0/63260c867b32721855cd5f954d5f3500.jpg?stmp=1278953424
706603,Ralph Field,2012-06-17 17:15:00,1018,That water looks nice for steelheading in the fall and spring.
706619,Joeytier,2012-06-17 18:04:00,3990,"Good stuff.  Do you use a strike indicator?  They help in presenting the fly to the right depth, not to mention...indicating strikes.  Also, you can add 1 or 2 small shots in faster flows to help get it down quicker.  I bet you'd find some browns and/or brookies if you moved upstream into some headwater stretches"
706620,Leecher,2012-06-17 18:04:00,7832, OK fully understand B
706635,bushart,2012-06-17 18:43:00,2628,Good Vid on that Bri
706638,misfish,2012-06-17 18:56:00,29133," I pretty much use the loop at the end of my main line to detect a strike..Lots of times,I can feel the strike.Lots of short strikes. I have coverd alot of water the last two months. Im still relearning how to read of the water."
706672,davey buoy,2012-06-17 22:19:00,5505,Looks like you had another good day!!!!!Way to go:clapping:
706673,MJL,2012-06-17 22:29:00,2427,Sexy water Brian...Great catch
706674,nroadrunner,2012-06-17 22:40:00,113,"Beautiful fish.  I have a river near me that looks prisitne for trout they even stocked it a couple times with rainbows over the last 20 years.  Nobody can seem to catch any though, very frustrating  LOL    Ian"
706689,Sinker,2012-06-17 23:24:00,8692,"I would say that's hogweed for sure brian. Stay the hell away from that stuff. Very, very nasty stuff!!  Great lookin water there bud. The stream fishing is keeping ya busy. I'm sure it clears the mind as well.  Oh ya, happy fathers day!  S."
706703,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-17 23:57:00,2690,"Great report Brian, beautiful fins on that bow."
