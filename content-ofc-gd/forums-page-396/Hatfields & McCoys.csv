703802,Canuck2fan,2012-06-08 02:26:00,1444,"Having seen all 3 episodes, I was fairly impressed. Good acting for the most part. After the first installment I was worried they had made a remake of ""titanic"" using the feud as just a historical backdrop to a love story. By the end though they were back to telling about the feud.  I don't know exactly how accurate it is though. Really though with a feud like that who would know what was the REAL story but the people dead and buried. Except for court transcripts and the government records all the rest would just be from letters if they survived and those letters would be just a bunch of ""they said"" and ""we did"" yadda yadda yadda go team.  I read an article that Paxton visited the real area before he flew over to Romania to shoot it, and that he didn't really feel any affinity for his character. Pretty good acting by him is that was true..."
703813,danc,2012-06-08 03:03:00,4677,Pfffftt. There was a Storage Wars marathon on A&E airing at the same time. No brainer as to what I watched.
703849,Fisherman,2012-06-08 11:15:00,7201," Yup, much better than watching a bunch of 'tards having a shoot em up over even more retarded stuff.  Looks like pretty low IQ.  Similar to the Moonshiners program, I would be rather embarrased to be seen on TV as a hick of such low quality."
703850,Roy,2012-06-08 11:31:00,13728," It's still history, whether you like it or not."
703851,Billy Bob,2012-06-08 11:41:00,5865, Anyone who would pick Storage Wars over the Hatfields & McCoys need to have their IQ checked.......  You do realize that Storage Wars is completely scripted....or do you....
703856,bushart,2012-06-08 12:02:00,2628,I do find history an interesting subject----(maybe hoping not to repeat it   )  Heck I even enjoy watchin Pawn Stars---seeing what piece of history walks in the door
703871,iFish4real,2012-06-08 13:35:00,386," heh, funny...""bani"" is like cents here  ...so ya 47mil ""lei"" would be around $13mil USD...pretty cheap I guess"
703881,Fisherman,2012-06-08 14:12:00,7201," It's what they find in some of the storage bins that is interesting, not the idiots that do the bidding"
703904,Billy Bob,2012-06-08 15:39:00,5865, I agree but find the show as a  whole is waste of my time...I sometimes get stuck watching it at the FH...Pawn Stars IMHO is much better.
703917,Fisherman,2012-06-08 16:05:00,7201,"Yes, Chum Lee, my favourite.."
703919,Billy Bob,2012-06-08 16:11:00,5865," I like the OLD MAN........but also CL......did you see the one where a guy came in with a ton of silver......they purchased it for $111,000.00.....Rick took some and had Silver dollars made with ""In Old Man We Trust"" on them.....to be sold at $60 each........too bad they didn't have them when we visited their shop in April......but I do have a OLD MAN shot glass...."

703925,Harrison,2012-06-08 16:23:00,2202,Really looking forward to watching this show.  I reserve myself to watch a couple shows at a time.  Right now it's Game of Thrones and Mad Men.  No spoilers on the Hatfields & McCoys though please.
703959,bushart,2012-06-08 19:02:00,2628,Yes I have'nt seen pt 3
703962,Harrison,2012-06-08 19:10:00,2202, Including one OFC'er.
705212,Ralph Field,2012-06-12 22:23:00,1018,Nofish4me thank you for posting your link I enjoyed watching the episodes on the computer.
705271,chris.brock,2012-06-13 01:44:00,4053,"after watching it, I researched the actual history of the feud and the TV show was bang on, the sequence of events is almost exact and true, the length of time may seem abit distorted though (in reality, there were years of gaps without incidents between the 2 families, it all didn't happen in less than a year the way it appears on the show) very cool that they stuck to the facts, even more shocking is how people can be violent and set on revenge I thought it was bizzare that the head of each family, who could have likely ended the trouble early, lived the longest"
705353,HTHM,2012-06-13 12:06:00,4082,  I saw what you did there...
705700,blue pickeral,2012-06-14 10:42:00,267," Go back further in time and you'll discover that the original 'white' settlers of this area were displaced farm workers -rednecks so named for the time spent out in the fields - from Scotland. While better educated Scots were making their marks around the world -John A MacDonald, Sanford Fleming and others - the rednecks were the squalling drunken louts.  As such it should come as not much of a surprise that a man from Kentucky -Clay I think it was - was a big proponent behind America attacking British North America in 1812. Seeing as Britain was dealing with Napoleon in Europe and minor grade troops were garrisoned in Canada, Americans such as Clay thought the timing was right to fulfill American 'Manifest Destiny' - occupying all of North America.  Due to a number of factors, including an enlistment clause which determined that U.S. troops would not have to leave American territory unvoluntarily, the U.S. lost the war. They did get a national anthem out of it though.  Program on the War of 1812 on the History Channel (Canada) this Sunday at 9."
705828,Millhouse2020,2012-06-14 16:46:00,152,  Interesting...  Somehow I doubt that will make it to A&E or The History Channel
706781,Billy Bob,2012-06-18 11:23:00,5865,Here is some more info/news on the Hatfield & McCoys.......  http://hosted2.ap.org/NYBUE/f7ded15e4d4846268a17b79c1c4b7cb8/Article_2012-06-18-US-Hatfields-and-McCoys/id-ddef542e84dd48b499f4c8a77af5e2ff
703530,Billy Bob,2012-06-07 11:25:00,5865,"Did this come on your History Channel up in Canada.....I know you guys sometimes get things later then we do.......but if you do have a chance, WATCH this....it's a TRUE STORY......but my advice is Tivo or DVR it as it tends to have a lot of commercials, ESPECIALLY towards the end of each episode....BTW it's a three episode series....all 3 have already played up here....but anyway's see here from more info....  http://www.history.com/shows/hatfields-and-mccoys"
703532,grimsbylander,2012-06-07 11:30:00,3016,"Hey BB, yes it's been on here too. The third and final episode will be on this coming Monday. We've been watching it and really enjoying it. Very well done."
703536,Billy Bob,2012-06-07 11:39:00,5865,OH........that's GREAT......here's a game of questions you can try to answer....might not be easy for you guys not seeing the final episode.....but it shouldn't ruin it for you......some are hard to answer....AND it timed (which I didn't know for the first question) so the faster you answer the more points you get......  http://www.history.com/shows/hatfields-and-mccoys/interactives/hatfields-and-mccoys-trivia-game
703548,smally21,2012-06-07 12:03:00,993,its up here and its pretty good! they sure knew how to settle a score back then. can't say too much about the genius hatfield boy...and his excellent decision making when it comes to women.  good tv but its no game of thrones..  ill be in front of it next monday!
703552,bushart,2012-06-07 12:17:00,2628,Been watchin---really good  I was the only one in my discussions that said after episode 1 that they maybe they did'nt kill the young Hatfield boy in the cabin even though previews eluded to  What can I say---when it comes to Hillbillys---takes one to know one
703554,smally21,2012-06-07 12:45:00,993,nice! leave it to BB to bring up the gun-totin' score settlin' kentucky west virginia fueds!! where did the concept of 'vengeance' go..  any real history buffs that can vouch for the accuracy of the show so far? has it been glamorized/adapted for tv or has it been fairly true to the events???
703561,iFish4real,2012-06-07 13:20:00,386,"it's funny you post this today cause just this morning one of my coworkers told me about this movie being filmed in Romania, my country of origin :) it is a nice country but seriously, they make a film about Virginia and film it in Romania??? ...it must be all about money"
703567,smally21,2012-06-07 13:32:00,993,"romania? that would explain the occasional gothic castle in the background...  i heard it cost 47 million lei$ to make , to give you an idea that is like 47 billion bani$!!!!"
703575,grimsbylander,2012-06-07 13:51:00,3016,  I detect the beginning of the soon to be famous Sinclair-Billy Bob feud!! I can see them now...firing 1/2 jigheads at each other!! LOL

703611,Billy Bob,2012-06-07 16:43:00,5865, Some days I feel that old....
703613,Billy Bob,2012-06-07 16:46:00,5865," If you research it, it had nothing to do with money...The Appalachia Mountains are no longer undeveloped like they needed to use as back drops in the 1800 hundreds....it was too hard to get back drops without houses, telephone poles, electric lines, etc.....so Romania was chosen as the hills there fit right into the times for the movie."
703614,Billy Bob,2012-06-07 16:48:00,5865,  Better watch your back Simon....Billy Bob is a VERY good shot.....
