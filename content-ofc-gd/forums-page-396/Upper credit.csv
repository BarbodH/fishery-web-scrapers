Started further downstream casting small spinners into likely structure and logs, this turned out 2 small 5"" browns (sorry no pics). The water was (complete guess) probably around 17 Celsius and at a normal level.  After that we headed upstream to the provincial park, a very long (hour or so) hike in waders in full sun yielded no fish but nicer water, after hiking all the way back we headed to the far north end of the park. Casting spinners produced nothing, after wading downstream I observed several small splashes in the middle of a river. So I took out the old fly rod and tied on a royal wulff, as soon as it ouched the water, FISH ON! A very decent 9"" brookie, which capped off the day nicely before barbecued chicken for dinner! "
