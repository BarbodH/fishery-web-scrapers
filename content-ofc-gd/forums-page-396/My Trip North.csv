705262,Live2fish85,2012-06-13 01:19:00,1633,"Well I just got back from my trip up north, the fishing wasn't the greatest but was still a great time.  We got up there saturday night and it was to late to fish so we just talked and planned for the next morning.  We weren't able to get the boat until a bit later that day so we went to a nice shore spot. Was so nice to be north in the with nothing but the sounds of nature and not the city. The spot we started at was awesome a nice bay with a little waterfall/rapids running into.    I got a nice picture with the new combo that I was excited to use for pike to say the least.    Well the first cast my friend takes with a spinnerbait he got a nice little pike after that he tried his look at some eyes with the float rod. At that time I tried the fly rod for some pike. After a few cast bam, see the flash and the line go tight, set the hook and I finally hooked into my first pike on the fly combo and first actual fish to put up a fight unlike the rockbass I caught while practicing with it days before lol.  Heres me fighting the fish     I didn't get a picture of the fish as I was to far from my friend and wasn't able to get a good one by myself.  We kept fishing and my friend got a nice little eye on the pin. He was happy as it was a first for him.We kept fishing with only rock bass and some oos smallies to show.  We went back to the cottage and ate breakfast then got the boat and took off. After trolling for a few minutes my friend landed a nice pike. Then that was it other then oos smallies and rock bass.  Later that night my friend got one walleye which went nicely with his pike.  The next morning we were back at it bright and early. We went to the spot which produced the most, took a bit of worked hoping out on the beaver dam and pulling the boat over but we got in and after a few rock bass and oos smallies my friend hooked into a walleye, then two seconds later I got one. Wasn't like the Lake Erie walleye but was going to taste better.    We went on without much luck until we were trolling and my friend got a nice walleye to add to the fryer. We didn't end up with anymore walleye though.    After fishing but nothing to show but rock bass and the oos smallies which the lake is full of, I convinced my friend or bugged him enough to try for pike again so I could use my fly rod again. Well we were working the shore line drop offs and he got snagged in a tree. Well as hes working on that I was busy casting away. I thought I seen something go for my fly so I casted back at the spot let the fly sink and bit and start to retrieve the line, I could barely see my fly and then I see a mouth open then a flash and then the line tightened and I set the hook. Finally got something a bit bigger and alot better fighter. It wasn't big but felt great on the fly rod, did I mention that I love fly fishing. There is nothing like it that I have experienced.  Heres my mangled fly.   and a pic with he scrappy little guy   That was it for the fish. To me I couldn't have asked for a better trip. I got to catch a pike on the fly which I was really hoping to do, landing 2 was icing on the cake.  Now time to get at tying some flies for Brian. An to prep for tomorrow as I may head down for some gar pike on the fly.  Hope you enjoyed  Chris"

705354,Moosebunk,2012-06-13 12:09:00,3970,Great report Chris.  The area you're fishing (the pics) remind me alot of a place nearby where the fishing is much like you describe.  You get me motivated to get out with the long pole and try to get the same results.  Good stuff!
705360,Live2fish85,2012-06-13 12:28:00,1633,Thanks MB. It truely is a blast and I envy you for living nearby to something that is so nice lol.  I need to find a job up north lol.  Also thank you catch and release.

705604,Live2fish85,2012-06-14 00:51:00,1633, Thanks man. It is a blast catching them on the fly rod. I can't wait to get another on the fly.  The scenery was nice. Nothing like going up north and being surrounded by nature and the smell of the north.  Smells a hell of alot better then Hamilton.
705609,spincast,2012-06-14 01:06:00,3279,Hey bud - looks like you did well  Sweet scenery and you got what you were looking for - congrats. Carp on the fly at the folks place next?
