706497,ckozizzle,2012-06-17 12:07:00,1,"Newbie fisherman here. Just looking for a bit of info regarding Perch fishing in port dover. When is the best time of season? When is the best time of day? Does someone under the age of 11 need a fishing license? Is the lighthouse dock still the place to go?  I want to take the little guy fishing there and i dont want it to be a bust, i would like it if we caught at least something. lol. Thanks!"
706587,mike rousseau,2012-06-17 16:34:00,4661,Don't need a license till he's 18...  Other then that I can't help...
706611,Ralph Field,2012-06-17 17:40:00,1018,Why not take him to a trout farm in your area where he is guaranteed to catch fish? Perch fishing off a pier is often hit or miss.
706667,Billy Bob,2012-06-17 21:21:00,5865,Is Dover on Lake Erie........are you fishing from shore......
706683,Twocoda,2012-06-17 23:14:00,4130,is it a bust to take your child fishing and not catch anything??? re-evaluate your fishing experiences with your family....fish are just a bonus and not an expectation  As stated its hit and miss ...if your there and its on you could be in for the time of your life...if its not on....youll have made some great memories...i understand the need to be a super hero in your childs eyes...but being a realist...fishing is called fishing... not catching  Good Luck if you decide to go...either way ...youll end up being a super hero in your childs eyes  Cheers
706864,coolwater,2012-06-18 16:20:00,43," Twocoda:  I don't  post a lot but read the boards every week, hoping I can get some good info, or better yet, help someone else but I just had to say what a good quote you had for ckoz Re:  ""fishing is called fishing...not catching"".	I tell my grandchildren it's a day out together, what else do you need.    	Thanks"
706878,Billy Bob,2012-06-18 16:38:00,5865,But the CATCHING Days are a lot more fun......
706885,Mike Pike,2012-06-18 16:46:00,1332,Dover is a good choice whether the fish are biting or not.  Just make sure your little fella has his swim trunks and you can always pack it up if the fishin' is slow and go for a swim!
