706329,Sawyer,2012-06-16 14:43:00,48,"Wow! I have to say this board has its share of members filled with a negative disposition.  Relax.  What I find interesting is the ratio between posts with subjects specifically targeting ""good deeds"" and ""bad deeds"".  It's clear the latter receives significantly more attention.  My personal experience on and off the water shows that there are way more anglers out there who conduct themselves in a conservationist and preservative way - and I believe you know this too.  I believe our Ontario fishery on the whole is and will always continue to be world class.  And it will remain that way because of all the good people on and off this board - the silent majority that never get's the same attention.  -Sawyer"

706056,Dave Bailey,2012-06-15 11:26:00,1641," As far as I know there was legislation, but during the 80s (if I recall correctly) it wasn't being enforced due to cutbacks. I believe that a government inspector was required to board incoming ships and ensure that ballast water was dumped at sea before coming down the St. Lawrence. At least, that's what I've heard, but others may have better info.  But don't worry about more horror stories coming from our government, they are now enacting measures to prevent you from hearing such things: Parks Canada staff banned from criticizing Feds"

706072,Dave Bailey,2012-06-15 12:31:00,1641,"   That seems to be getting around. I coined it years ago as Bailey's Second Law: There is no direct relationship between the three virtues of intelligence, education, and wisdom.  Bailey's First Law states: Necessity may be the mother of invention, but laziness is usually the father."
706075,Photoz,2012-06-15 12:37:00,792,"Although I have read the whole series of posts on this subject, (several times) the amount of the fines, where the fish were dumped, the names of the offenders . . . .    I STILL HAVE NOT SEEN WHAT SPECIES OF FISH WERE DUMPED? Rainbows? Salmon? Bass? Snakehead? Silver carp? Grass carp? If they WERE Asian carp, snakehead or grass carp we REALLY have a problem! If they were bass, trout, perch etc., other than the fact they could be infected with SOMETHING, they PROBABLY won't do any HARM! WERE the kind of fish that were illegally 'dumped' identified? Just WHAT were they?"
706087,bushart,2012-06-15 13:03:00,2628,"  Does'nt matter---a waltz thru the fishing regs is very exact about transferring ""ANY"" species from one body of water to the next  To the point about having live fish in a livewell in transport home  IF these fish were indeed farmed---may come with a whole gambit of issues on wild stocks"

Just seems to me that our democratically elected representatives and their policies are becoming more Orwellian by the day...  And I'd be interested in knowing what species that couple released as well, although it's true that it doesn't really matter from a legal standpoint as they weren't released into their native water in any case.  Hopefully they were few enough and small enough that they ended up being nothing more than an exotic and tasty treat for the local residents..."
706116,bigbuck,2012-06-15 14:54:00,2449,"We've got plenty of laws and don't really need more of them. We just need to work with what we have and enforce them properly. If there is a lack of enforcement staff, hire some more, the fines they generate will propbably pay their wages and also take a chunk out of the deficit (or end up in someone's pocket LOL)."

706151,bushart,2012-06-15 17:02:00,2628,"This is off the radio website in Dryden Ontario   Strong Turnout For Protest On Closure Of ELA  By Mike Ebbeling - June 15th, 2012 - 9:08am  About 90-people converged on Kenora MP Greg Rickford's Dryden office yesterday in a noisy protest. They were out to protest Bill C-38, which passed in the House of Commons overnight. Those in attendance were most upset about cuts to environmental programs and the closure of the Experimental Lakes area west of Dryden. Dale MacKenzie says the Federal Government is more like a dictatorship and Rickford should be held accountable. MacKenzie says the ELA is a world class research facility and says the Feds can afford the $600,000s to keep the facility running. MacKenzie says the way Bill C-38 was handled was ""un-democratic"" and that voters are getting cranky. Rickford was in Ottawa."
706159,jedimaster,2012-06-15 18:17:00,3472,"The reality is there is no legal political means to stop Bill C38... The reality is that if the Liberals didn't force feed in the Gun registry the Con's would not have a Majority. Of course the NDP's had several chances to join with a minority govt to squash that, as well the liberals could have also voted the registry down as well, but they all were in it for there own good as well.  The reality? There will be no riots, there will be no revolt, there will be no buses turned over or cars set on fire, the Govt will not be overthrown by the public, there will be no stopping this bill. Its funny how the Canucks losing in the playoffs can cause a riot but something like this just goes by with people shaking there fists in the air. So I suggest everyone just sit back and eat your TV Dinner."

706161,bushart,2012-06-15 18:33:00,2628,  No there will  not be be a riot---but these points should be noted for the next election so we cannot claim that ignorance is bliss  Notes like this C38 that gutted environment and fisheries protection like a deer---items not campaigned on  Don't recall the talk of oas hittin 67 in the last campaign  I guess when Harpo sat at the piano and sang a little help from my friends---he was eluding to Enbridge and Suncor  Eat that tv dinner

Im sure when for decades all of our other governments were pandering to say the car manufacturers you were equally as bothered.  Speaking of bother, why do you?  I must have missed the government that only ever enacted laws on things the explicitly said they were going to during the election campaign."

If it is so important to the entire world perhaps it should be funded by the UN."

We let these great big ocean liners enter our waterways and let them dump thier ballast releasing hitch hikers from other countries in our water ways.  If our governemt had 1/2 a brain there would be legislation to prevent this act with serious concequences. The ships should be forced to hold the ballast until it is a safe distance from our ports or to dump long before they are in our ports. So they either come in full or empty either way we could tell if they were dumped near our waterways.  I call for fines large enough to hurt the parent companies and jail time 10+ years for capitans of these vessels that dump in our ports.  As for the people that sparked this conversation. 1 answer JAIL TIME!!!, FINES!!! and confiscation of the vehicle used to get there, fines against the person & business.  So sick our weak laws and governemt!!!"

705873,jigsnreels,2012-06-14 18:47:00,133," Agree.  Unfortunately, I don't forsee heavy fines for industrial polluters coming from a government that is currently in the process of watering down our environmental protection laws, muzzling their own environmental oversight bodies or otherwise shutting them down entirely, restricting the ability of non-profit environmental watchdogs to raise funds, and labelling any public entity that shows concern for the environment as ""terrorists,"" all done as a thinly disguised reach-around to the oil industry so that they can be free to build their pipelines without having to worry about such minor annoyances as overwhelming public disapproval or the resulting contamination and destruction of wildlife habitat."

The Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments have destroyed the confidence in public service. Every public sector worker in under attack because no one wants to talk about the value that they provide.
