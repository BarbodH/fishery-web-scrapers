706190,lew,2012-06-15 21:42:00,12766,"The truck & boat are all washed, waxed, loaded and ready to roll at sunrise tomorrow morning. This'll be about my 8th year at Lakair on the West Arm of Nipissing and we spend about 3 weeks a year up there.  The muskies can be tempermental at times and do a good job of hiding deep in the weeds, but with alot of effort they can be dug out. My last trip up there was 10 months ago when I was able to get these 3 pretty ladies.  I know where these girls hang out and hopefully their Momma's will be there  too.  I don't bother posting many fishing reports anymore but if the Nipissing musky Gods smile on me next week I may just write one up      "
706191,Roy,2012-06-15 21:48:00,13728,"You have a super time up there Lew. Find big momma and give her a hug for me. Looking forward to a LEW report.  I see those three biggies were caught casting.  Once you know your water, casting's the way."
706192,Joey,2012-06-15 21:50:00,9122,"See you tomorrow Lew.  We're all packed and ready, planning on arriving noonish tomorrow  I'm hoping one day you and Paul can do a morning fish so I can sleep in"
