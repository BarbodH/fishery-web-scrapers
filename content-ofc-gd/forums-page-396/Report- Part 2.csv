On our way home we hit the Nipigon River for a couple hours. Mixed bag for us there!  A few lakers, a few OOS eyes, whitie,  brookie and a bow!            An amazing trip all around!!! I will be back sooner than later!!!  Now its time to get ready for walleyes! Heading up to Oba, Ontario to guide walleyes for 2 weeks! Can't wait!  Hope you all enjoyed!   TDunn"
