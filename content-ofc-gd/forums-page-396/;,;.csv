704908,Nipfisher,2012-06-12 01:26:00,2449,Not sure about the bottom of the French. We have to wait until Sat to fish the upper part near Lake Nipissing.
704911,captpierre,2012-06-12 01:43:00,2521,"My take:  fatty fish like alwives, herring, whitefish, trout equals large, fat muskies like on  GB.  Contrast the Kawarthas.  Long fish but the weight isn't there.  I suspect the French would be in between there.  peter"
704921,backbay,2012-06-12 02:07:00,773,"I'm speculating, because I don't fish the French, but I wouldn't argue with what you have to say about GBay. I don't really think they'd be bigger in the French, though, just my opinion."
704925,Nipfisher,2012-06-12 02:10:00,2449,"Just a guess as well but My guess is average muskie for French river is probably 33 -35"". High 40s and some 50s to be found but most #s would be in the 30s."
704957,Rich Nelson,2012-06-12 03:23:00,332,"Certain parts of the bay and the French are better for numbers. Georgian bay has bigger fish on average, and as Im sure you know , exist in a very low density. The French definately has some giants in it as well, but its not a numbers game like the kawarthas...."

705257,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-13 01:07:00,535,"  Wow, that is really incredible! I knew it was a trophy water but that is insane!"
705260,BillM,2012-06-13 01:11:00,17367,GBay has the next world record.
705366,OhioFisherman,2012-06-13 12:42:00,6623," I spent about 25 years going to Pointe Au Baril, it was very rare for us to see a small muskie, or catch one. We did lose a number of pigs over the years, our success at landing them was nil. It was enough though to keep us going back, it was never a numbers game for us and we should have been better prepared for a huge fish. Most of our big fish hook ups came after we had given up on Muskies for the day and were bass fishing.  The French probably has the numbers, perhaps in limited areas? I think a lot of Muskies at Pointe Au Baril might just be deeper water fish? They don`t have to look as hard for food?"
705406,Raf,2012-06-13 15:09:00,3495,"there are no fish in gbay or the french, stick to the kawarthas."
705414,lew,2012-06-13 15:57:00,12766, None in Nipissings West Arm either.
705574,mike rousseau,2012-06-13 23:18:00,4661,  The Larry has been completely fished out also...
705825,Millhouse2020,2012-06-14 16:35:00,152,"  Dang, I guess I should make other plans this weekend..."
705865,Squid,2012-06-14 18:23:00,1656,Lake babaganouche has muskies!!
705899,lew,2012-06-14 20:21:00,12766, Absolutely Pete
705991,bigcreekdad,2012-06-15 02:31:00,546,"I've been fishing the French above and below the Chaudiere dams since the mid 90's.....I've never seen a muskie, or heard of any caught. You need to talk to the Indian elders to get any of the stories of muskie from the old times.  That being said, we've caught some massive sheepshead, and, for numbers, you can't beat the rock bass."
706889,Loadman,2012-06-18 16:50:00,63,"I was at one point an exclusive musky guy for about 10 years... and almost always fished GBAY. Having said that, I think its great there are alot of people that want to go out and fish it understand this though. You can go DAYS without a pull and then all of a sudden you get 3 in a day. It can be very frustrating but the rewards are great. I was there the day G. Bristow caught his 58"" and let me tell you its a fine thing to see. Scary part is we have seen fish there that are gross in size. Time on the water and many, many fishless days. But all it takes is one pull on the rod and your the next K. O'brien."
706942,Fishing yoda,2012-06-18 19:15:00,29,"You guys all have great points but since when do pple say there is no muskie in west arm, i caught one last year right behind honeymoon island ????? i think maybe you guys might not be looking in the right places. My unlce has lived here for years and catches them every spring off the dock.... If you truly want a good concentration of good size muskie( between 40"" to 50"") my recomendation would be the veuve river , a lot of big muskie caught in this small river. I have 2 friends that fish this river regularly and they have both caught some over 50"". I would say the french is good for muskie probly the average would be in the 40's .  I've been fishing the area for about 10-12 years now and there is pletty of muskie up there just need to know were to find them..."
706945,danbouck,2012-06-18 19:22:00,4380,"No muskie in the west arm, lots of pike though"
706951,Squid,2012-06-18 19:34:00,1656,"  Fishingyoda, everyone was kidding about no fish anywhere...."
