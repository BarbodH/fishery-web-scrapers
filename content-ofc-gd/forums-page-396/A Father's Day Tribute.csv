So I'm taking a few minutes to remember our forefathers, the sons, the husbands, the many who grew up without fathers and husbands and the young men who never had a chance to become fathers.  Watching Hamilton's Avro Lancaster fly overhead I'm reminded of the dedication of this plane to one such hero.  http://www.warplane.com/pages/ourstories_mynarski.html  With that I wish all of our soldiers past and present both here in Canada and the U.S. and all the fathers here a very Happy Fathers Day.   *Salute*"
