706342,Terry,2012-06-16 16:59:00,14456,a bit expensive but Xmas is coming  or make one
706368,Handlebarz,2012-06-16 19:41:00,3790,Dang that looks cool I will look into one some day I like the idea of making one but would be afraid of loosing my camera. All though I would be trolling right beside the boat watching a down rod.  Thanks for the ideas maybe I will head to the hard where store any way and see what they have.
