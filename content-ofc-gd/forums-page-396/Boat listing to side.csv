706814,pylon,2012-06-18 13:50:00,68,I have an 18' in/ out board seems to list to on side sometimes worse than others. Is that an adjustment to the little fin just above the prop ??
706815,Roy,2012-06-18 13:55:00,13728,Does it also list when you're not moving? How's the weight distribution? Does it pull to one side? Yes it could very well be the 'fin'.
706819,Fisherman,2012-06-18 14:11:00,7201,Are you saying that the boat is lower in the water on one side or the other or trolling in circles.  Listing is caused by the weight(person)s) in the boat.  Going in circles is caused by the trim tab.
706825,Roy,2012-06-18 14:35:00,13728,Is it possible you have water trapped in the under-floor hull compartments? That would cause it too.

706868,pylon,2012-06-18 16:25:00,68,No it's usually level when going slow. Seems to be a higher speed thing. How do you adjust the trim tab ( fin ) And yes there was more water in it than I thought   Thanks guys
706887,DanD,2012-06-18 16:48:00,2223,That tab (fin) is to compensate for engine torque; in other words you adjust that to take the pull out of the steering when under power. There must be some form of extra weight on the side that it is listing to; that when the boat is on plain and much of the hull is out of the water; this weight is causing the boat to lean?  Dan.
