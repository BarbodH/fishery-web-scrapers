706563,ricardo,2012-06-17 15:22:00,26,"I have a baitcasting reel that looks brand new and its still in the box with leather case and oil. Its from 1974 and it says heddon. I put some line on the reel, followed the instructions on how to use it and can't get the hang of it. So I'm thinking of selling or trading it but can't seem to find the value. Any suggestions?"

706593,aplumma,2012-06-17 16:47:00,6896,From that era they are very nice mantel pieces. The low end baitcasters we have today are way ahead of the unit you are trying to use. You might find a place on the want ads here and see if someone wants to trade with you.   Art
706652,ricardo,2012-06-17 20:13:00,26,I would love to put up a pic of it but I don't know how to with my mobile phone. Its the only thing I use. It is a nice looking reel. But I'd rather up grade if I could.
