I will be fishing the river in the paisley area. thanks in advance  tight lines, Eric"
706740,fisherkid4,2012-06-18 01:33:00,32,"I also heard that upstream from paisley has resident browns on the main saugeen if anybody could confirm this it would be greatly apriciated! Feel free to pm me if u dont feel comfortable posting intel on a public forum!  Fish on, Eric"
706741,GreenCanada,2012-06-18 01:42:00,375,"If you do some google searches you're likely to find some useful information to start with.  Look up what water conditions browns prefer, ie. water temps, etc. Then try to find out what the temperature of the water might be around where you're thinking of going. Some Government sites offer up to date water conditions. Best part of catching nice residents is finding them!  Good luck, we look forward to reading about your experience if you get out on the water this coming weekend!"

Not only will you likely kill any fish you catch due to stress, they also won't be actively feeding at these temps so the fishing will be slow. Probably have more fun bothering the bass and pans."
