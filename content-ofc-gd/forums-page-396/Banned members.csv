706654,misfish,2012-06-17 20:22:00,29133,"I would like to ask,how long a ban is in effect on this site?  It would seem some have had a ban for sometime now. Good people(maybe not in the mines of mods or other members,time to grow up IMO) but good willing and helpful. Some may  come across as ignorant,or disrespectful,like myself,the words come out wrong,and taken the wrong way.Or it,s the way the real worlds is,and some dont want to except it.  I would like to see  a short ban if need be,but it,s time to let some good members back in.  Guys like DR.Sal,and GBFISHER come to mind. Guys that have their opinions,but speak truth most of the time.You may not like their opinions,but this is an open forum.   Many here have not met each other,but when you do meet a member,it,s like,holy crap,he/she,is a great person. I speak from experience.  Time to lift the iron gate, for some that want to rejoin.   "
