Well, my little guy (who's just 3) and I went out this evening and got a great deal on this new (to us) canoeâ€¦. just $150! The previous owner ran the keel over some rocks, and repaired it with ""fiberglass foam"" and say it's watertight, but I will rip out their repair and fiberglass it properly at some point in the next couple of weeks. The boy and I are very excited. I can't tell you how many times in my life I have gone out and bought a couple of paddles, because of a new canoe, and here I am, at it again! Oh, so, btw, any advice on where to buy the marine fiberglass stuff, do the repair right? I'll probably try and do a little reading on the internet, of course. Cheers     "

706276,woodenboater,2012-06-16 03:32:00,2277,"Lotsa free parking at West Marine and since you're in the Beach, it's a short drive. Noah's is a cool shop but it's further west. Neither website is super easy to navigate"
706287,blue pickeral,2012-06-16 09:43:00,267,"Long ago, I had a Watson that also suffered some damage. Took it back to the manufacturer and they fixed it inexpensively so that it looked brand new. Not sure if they are still in business, (can't even remember where they're located) but having the original mold for the canoe makes for a better job."
706289,mrpike,2012-06-16 10:09:00,151,You can get what you need at CANADIAN TIRE in the marine department.  just put on a light patch of  fiberglass. And then paint to match or repaint the hole thiing  just use marine paint light coats two or three coats should do it for you. AND THEN YOU ARE GOOD TO GO.  GOOD LUCK   SIR.
706292,thatleetboy,2012-06-16 10:54:00,143,"I was in my Crappy Tire last night, and despite the fact that I thought I had bought similar stuff there in years past, was unable to find anything. That's actually part of why I thought I would ask.... I was going to try again at the big one at Leslie/Lakeshore, and I guess the referral to West Marine gives me a couple of great options. Thanks guys.  Mrpike> will marine paint actually stick to the fiberglass the, and jazz up the appearance of the exterior? Just use a regular brush? Does it add much weight? Thx."
706293,thatleetboy,2012-06-16 11:12:00,143,"The Watson Canoe Co does seem to have gone out of business... but I found an interesting page while trying to look up the ""how to paint a canoe""  http://www.mohawkcanoes.com/care_f.html"
706313,zamboniwaterboy,2012-06-16 12:48:00,126,"The glass and resin in CTC may be questionable.  To paint, buy high quality marine paint at West, Noah, or Composite Canada.  Two person paint method -  using a mini  low fuzz roller, one person roll the paint on, as the second person uses a high quality 3"" brush, just touch the paint ever so gently to knock the bubbles off.  DO NOT REWORK THE PAINT WITH THE BRUSH!  The brush should have next to NO paint on the tips of the bristles!  Done properly it will produce a really nice finish."
706488,blue pickeral,2012-06-17 10:01:00,267,"Too bad about Watson. Why not just patch all over the place - even where it doesn't need it. Will make the canoe look mean - kinda what they did to the team bus in the movie ""Slap Shot"".  another idea - once you've got the fiberglass patching done, maybe one of those vinyl 'wraps' might work over the canoe? Certainly would be unique."
