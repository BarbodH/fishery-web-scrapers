1028038,dave524,2018-05-07 20:27:00,4508,"I tried to get that stuff 30 plus years ago unsuccessfully, was going to use it as shooting line on a Hi Density 30 foot shooting head fly line , ended up using 100 feet of 20 pound Maxima, it worked fine.  edit: you would not believe how effective a 280/300 grain head with a short leader and a black Wooly Bugger is at dragging smallies off the bottom in 10 to 20 feet of water, just saying "
1028062,cuzza,2018-05-08 12:55:00,467,"Thanks Dave, looking for some to try as part of a nymphing leader setup - I like how easy it is to get it to straighten out. I have some blue Stren I can use for now and I'll keep an eye out. Love fishing shooting heads, not delicate but easy to cast - have them as options on my 6wt and 8wt  I use the coated running line as it's a bit easier to manage when you've got line all round your feet"
1028063,BillM,2018-05-08 13:57:00,17367,"Richard, why not use a service like CrossBorderPickups?   Easy way to get whatever you want from the US without paying crazy shipping and duty.."
1028078,cuzza,2018-05-08 17:41:00,467,"Hey Bill, I go south of the border a lot for work so normally grab stuff but I couldn't even find any in Texas. I haven't tried the services like CrossBorderPickups, will look into it - thanks!"

1028223,dave524,2018-05-11 11:56:00,4508,"I prefer the shooting head concept when fishing sinking flylines, I found this that seems to be a pretty good primer on the technique. Basically it is a weight forward line with the level running line behind the 30 foot head replaced with a heavy mono.  https://www.fishing.net.nz/fishing-advice/how-to/tips-for-using-a-shooting-head/"
1028224,cuzza,2018-05-11 12:47:00,467,"Sums it up perfectly I'm playing around with the single hand Skagit lines at the moment which are super short shooting heads (the 6wt one is 13.5ft but you need a tip on top of that), easy to get good distance with no back-cast, great for big streamers/mice"
1028227,dave524,2018-05-11 13:33:00,4508,"I starting playing with this back in the late 70's, yes shorter and fatter gets deeper faster than the more traditional 30 foot head. When building a head I always bought heavier line than the rod was rated , would cut it after a test casting where I felt the rod was optimally loaded.  Never got into the spey thing."
