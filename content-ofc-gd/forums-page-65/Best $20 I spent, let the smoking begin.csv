1028668,misfish,2018-05-22 18:40:00,29133,How is it insulated ?
1028671,GBW,2018-05-22 19:23:00,8460,My fav. combo of woods to use
1028672,GBW,2018-05-22 19:41:00,8460,My day yesterday....   
1028674,misfish,2018-05-22 20:21:00,29133,"Ok, what the hell is on the fish, and are those bacon wrapped poppers?  What ever the answer, my mouth is watering.  Anyone ever try smoking escargots in mushroom caps ?"
1028675,misfish,2018-05-22 20:26:00,29133,"I,ll bet doing Portobello mushrooms would be awesome. Yes Im hungry right now."
1028676,GBW,2018-05-22 20:37:00,8460,Jalapeno ring's for added flavour and yes they are poppers.  SOOOO good!!!
1028681,FloatnFly,2018-05-22 20:58:00,1640,1 inch insulation wrapped with a sheet metal exterior.  You can see the base little smoker inside    
1028683,FloatnFly,2018-05-22 20:59:00,1640,Have these yummy morsels simmering in the sauce mix right now 
1028687,misfish,2018-05-22 21:47:00,29133,"Thanks for the replying. Chad right? That smoker looks like it,s been worked over pretty good. I am thinking I could build a plywood box and line it with reflex insulation. Would that work the same? The wrap they use on water heaters and hot water pipes. Maybe I am over thinking outside the box.  And that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Looks awesome."
1028692,FloatnFly,2018-05-22 22:34:00,1640,"Haha no, not chad  The smoker was my dad's for 20years before he gave it to me  He used stainless because it won't rot out in the elements.  Pork belly burnt ends, salt them over night, cube them up, smoker for 4 to 5 hours, then bbq for an hour and a half in a mixture of your favourite bbq sauce, little bit of honey, and butter.  It's like pork candy0"
1028694,woodenboater,2018-05-22 22:55:00,2277,BACON !!!!!!!!!
1028375,FloatnFly,2018-05-14 21:21:00,1640,"I've got that same smoker, my dad gave it to me when he upgraded, it's over 20 years old, but works like a champ.  Mine has been modified to hold the heat better, has a 1 inch layer of insulation wrapped in another layer of sheet metal."
1028381,woodenboater,2018-05-15 00:27:00,2277,awesome ! can this smoker be used for ribs as well cuz that would be wicked !
1028383,Tom S,2018-05-15 01:54:00,362,"I don't believe so. I think these are meant for a cold smoke (~165F), which is great for fish, jerky, sausage, and cheese. For ribs, brisket, pulled pork, and such you need a hot smoke, at 225F. For poultry you want to be even higher, 325F. Using too low of a temperature can open yourself up to food safety issues."
1028386,woodenboater,2018-05-15 03:17:00,2277,I smoke ribs at 225-250 on a Weber kettle or a Masterbuilt gasser as I like a low and slow smoke. I'd be curious if the Luhr can take a few more ˚s in temp to get to that magic zone ? would love to smoke trout and salmon so will be watching this thread for recipes 
1028388,FloatnFly,2018-05-15 12:44:00,1640,"I absolutely have used mine for ribs, and pork belly and smoked burgers.  It can't be used as a cold smoke, because of the heating element being in the unit.  Cold smoking requires smoke only.  These are the ribs I did in mine last week.  I cook them in a bbq sauce mixture with butter and honey on the bbq after words to make them sticky and delicious "
1028400,DanD,2018-05-15 15:36:00,2223,"You can cold smoke chicken; but it should be cured in a brine for at least 12 hours; that has curing salt in. Curing salt that contains 6.25% sodium nitrite and the remainder is table salt. It's the same stuff that keeps cured/smoked ham that pinkish colour that we're use to seeing and tasting. It also kills the bacteria that causes salmonella food poisoning. I've cured & cold smoked skinless chicken breast and then slice it up thin; using it for sandwich meat.  With a smoke generator and a card box, large enough to hold the amount of chicken i'm doing. I've also used my propane smoker; that I stick the cold smoke via a hose, into the smoker and left the burners off. 6-8-10 hours of smoke, depending on how smokey you want it. The temp inside the cardboard box or the smoker never goes above 80° The chicken is cured and ready to eat; the smoke just adds to the flavor. Dan."
1028403,dave524,2018-05-15 15:59:00,4508,"Did ribs last week, 25 minutes in the Instant Pot pressure cooker with some apple juice and liquid smoke , mopped them with BBQ sauce and finished them under the broiler for about 10 minutes in the gas oven, fall apart tender in under an hour"
1028405,Tom S,2018-05-15 16:11:00,362,If you boil your ribs the terrorists win. Just say no to boiled ribs.
1028407,dave524,2018-05-15 16:19:00,4508,"Not boiled , more like steamed, they are rubbed with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, brown sugar and paprika and sit on a trivet above the liquid.  Do I get a free pass or am I still a heretic edit : to make things worse I microwaved the baked potato we had with them"
1028408,FloatnFly,2018-05-15 16:37:00,1640,"If you boil your ribs, you're making soup and dumping all your flavour down the drain"
1028410,smitty55,2018-05-15 17:08:00,928,I make homemade Canadian bacon in my Big Chief smoker and it works great. I can get the the meat temp up to 125° and then I finish it in the oven to reach 150°. Sure puts store bought to shame.  Cheers
1028417,Tom S,2018-05-15 18:51:00,362,"You used liquid smoke. You're a heretic. Proper ribs need 3 things: -Cook technique - low and slow on a smoker for the entire time. None of this boiling/par baking/roasting shenanigans. -Texture - should pull away from the bones easily, but still have some bite. None of this sloppy fall of the bone mush. -Coating - develop a nice bark to give a flavour boost and some texture. Sauce sparingly and only right before eating."
1028424,misfish,2018-05-15 20:33:00,29133,"My ribs are done on the BBQ indirect heat. Low and slow. I like to put a dry rub on them. When done, mop the sauce to them, hit the flame side for a char. No one has complained yet.  So back to the smoker. Plywood box will be made to keep heat in. Looking for that single top burner as suggested. Also want to find chunk wood, not chips/shavings. First step will be the box and see if that gives me the heat I want. I want to be at that 175-210 deg.  I too want to do the bacon thing. I have done the oven method, but there was no smoke."
1028428,GBW,2018-05-15 21:34:00,8460,Yes you can get chunks.  They are smaller than you may guess but bigger than the wood chips.  TSC may have what you are looking for Mr B as I know I have purchased small bags of chunks before but cannot recall what store... When I have access to apple wood and black cherry I take it and make my own chunks from the limbs ans smaller sections of the tree.
1028429,GBW,2018-05-15 21:40:00,8460,"This is my fish brine. Brine: Soy (500ML), water (2L), honey (3 spoons), sweet chili tai (1/4 jar), pinch of brown sugar and then diced fresh jalapeno peppers.  Then I boil the brine and then let cool before I use it so the brine is well mixed. The wood used for smoking is key. I like apple & black cherry in the smoker together for fish. When I make a brine I keep some for a misting/spray bottle. Part way through the smoking process I'll give the fish a mist. The fish turns out super moist and not like a dry jerky. Also I don't pat it dry I put it right in the smoker after it's sat for 24hrs in the brine in the fridge. My old unit had a large drip pan and I was learning at the time but if I was going to make some anytime soon that's how I'd be doing it. Big Cliff has eaten it this way and said it was great, so has young_one (or what ever name he's using now).  My kids even love fish smoked this way."
1028563,pics,2018-05-18 17:00:00,1268,"I haven't really found a great method for ribs yet but for salmon I use a simple water, kosher salt and brown sugar brine.. I found that apple gives the best flavour for fish along with a maple syrup glaze.. All of my smoking wood is stuff I cut myself so I can choose the size. I recently tried a combination of soaked chunks and dry sawdust and it worked great.. Offset smoker with homemade charcoal.. "
1028601,DanD,2018-05-20 07:12:00,2223,Oh man that looks so good!!!
1028604,akaShag,2018-05-20 12:28:00,2073,"I have used Luhr Jensen smokers for about 35 years, first a Little Chief, then another Little Chief, and for the last 20 years or so, a Big Chief.  GREAT smokers! The element it comes with is just fine for smoking, in my view, and yes you definitely want to cover it with something (cardboard box is good) for windy and cold weather, it keeps the smoke in and the temperature up. ABSOLUTELY leave the skin on fish for smoking. One pan of smoke is not enough, in my experience, for fish of any type.  Hickory is by far my favourite, and two to three pans of smoke. To get dryer smoked fish, leave it in the smoker longer.  You can still use a wet brine, take the fillets out and put them on paper towels or clean newspaper to air dry for about an hour to allow them to form a ""pellicle"" which is a kind of tacky surface to which the smoke sticks better. Whitefish in my view take smoke better than any other fish.  If you get LOTS of them (I know Simcoe only has a small limit, but elsewhere you can keep more), then put the fillets into the smoker (after brining) for two pans of smoke, then pressure can them.  AWESOME. Doug"
1028605,akaShag,2018-05-20 12:33:00,2073,and yes you can do back bacon in your Luhr Jensen smoker.  It's FABULOUS.
1028621,smitty55,2018-05-20 17:02:00,928,Got that right Doug. Best of all you can adjust the seasonings to suit. The curing salt I get from the butcher is white so my meat didn't get that red tinge but is it ever good. I vacuum seal it in chunks and it's still excellent.   
1028631,pics,2018-05-21 12:25:00,1268,What kind of wood is the best for whitefish?.. I would think maple or apple/pear would be good rather than hickory but I haven't tried to smoke one yet..
1028632,akaShag,2018-05-21 12:58:00,2073,"My personal favourite is hickory.  After that, cherry.  I have not tried maple with fish but the thought does not appeal to me.  Never tried pear, but probably at some point I did try apple.......... Doug"
1028638,misfish,2018-05-21 16:00:00,29133,". Im going to pick up a few bags of different chips and chunks. I,ll be doing the bacon thing this fall. Along with steel head and salmon."
1028642,woodenboater,2018-05-21 18:46:00,2277,bit off topic but am using a combination of apple and cherry to smoke some back and side ribs today  weather is so fine today. Hope everyone is enjoying their long weekend !
1028645,pics,2018-05-21 21:28:00,1268,Hopefully I can get into some whitefish when I go to the Nipigon area in June.. I would love to smoke one..
1027957,misfish,2018-05-06 17:03:00,29133,"This came up in a classified ad.  I could not, pass on it. Now to   some whities next weekend and looking forward to some fall smoked salmon and steel head.  It,s an older model, top load.   If anyone has a dry smoke cure, I would like to hear from you. Im not a moist smoked fish guy. More of a jerky eater."

1027993,misfish,2018-05-06 21:46:00,29133,"Doing the you tube search, I could not find where it says how many times I should fill the wood chip pan. I have only seen where guys do it 2 times, 1 hour each, then let the fish cook for the rest of the 5-6 hours. Do I want the smoke going through out the full cook?  One thing I have found out for sure, strikly dry wood, no mixed wet/dry."
1027994,Fisherman,2018-05-06 21:46:00,7201,"Ok, leave out the sugar products and add cracked pepper, get a bag of peppercorns, Bettys rolling pin and lightly crush them.  Apply to your taste.  Not the rolling pin but the crushed p/corns."
1027996,dave524,2018-05-06 22:17:00,4508,"I had that exact model,  yes 2 pans is all you need for a stronger flavoured fish like salmon, one pan might be sufficient for a mild fish. Continue to dry after the pans are done to your desired dryness."
1027997,mitch seguin,2018-05-06 22:44:00,98,I still have the original box it came in.  I invert the box over the smoker which increases the smoke contact time and shortens the drying period.

Or a Force outboard works good to. For anyone here that has an OMC or a Force engine I feel your pain."
1028004,Tom S,2018-05-07 01:16:00,362,"You probably want to look for a salmon jerky recipe, instead of a smoked salmon or lox recipe. I'd be tempted to try this one (http://www.alaskafromscratch.com/2012/03/27/salmon-jerky/), eliminate the liquid smoke and do the dehydrating on the smoker. Use alder wood for the first bit to get the smoke flavor in there. Something with not enough smoke flavor can still be very tasty, while something with to much smoke flavor can be awful and can actually turn people off smoked food. So if you're unsure of how much smoke to add, I'd start on the light end and adjust the next time you smoke until you reach the level you like."
1028141,kenzy31,2018-05-09 17:21:00,261,"Enjoy that smoker buddy, good to see you again! See you on the water soon to smash whities ?"

1028318,misfish,2018-05-13 18:59:00,29133,"It was done sooner then I thought, BUT, It is very salty. I used sea salt, not pickling salt.  MISTAKE ?  There was a hint of smoke flavor. It smoked for 1.5 hours. Only did one pan 3 hand full of chips. The taste and texture,was like  salt cod. SOOOOOO This batch will go for fish cakes monday.    "
1028343,fish_fishburn,2018-05-14 13:00:00,1311,"I have the same one. They operate at a cool temperature. Makes these smokers awesome for fish. 1.5 hrs is barely getting the fish warmed up. In the fall you have to put a cardboard box over it to keep the heat in.. Do your fish with the skin on. It takes about 8 hrs to do a full batch of salmon chunks with skin  down. I use about 3 pans of wet wood chips  2 at the beginning and one more halfway through the cook. Everytime you take the lid off to look it will take another hour to get cooking again.. These things cook slow. Sorry mine is the Big Chief, same thing just a bit bigger."
1028344,Fish Farmer,2018-05-14 13:04:00,2234,"I have the same smaker Brian but the Big Chief. I use a wet prine but lot of people make a mistake Brining to long, Wet or dry 3 to 4 hours is long enough then rinse, sprinkle with you choice of seasoning. let dry. Last year I basted my Salmon with Sweet Chilli Tye  Guys loved it. I do 3 pans of chips but leave it in the smoker longer, it all depends on the size of your fish pieces. Some like moist and some dryer. Time is about how hot it is outside, shelter your smoker to make internal temp hotter. Put a box around the whole smoker, make for faster results. Old school was enough salt in the water to float a egg or potato. You probably would have had success with you fish Brian if you would have rinsed the salt off then put your spice on before you smoked. Your fish looked like Salt Cod buddy, hard to take the Neuff out of the Neuff "
1028366,misfish,2018-05-14 20:27:00,29133,"It,s a learning curve for me. Need to get out there and get me a couple more to smoke again. I have read where guys have built a plywood box to cover the smoker. I had a sheet of steel covering the breezy side, which in turn, blocked the sun from helping with the heat thing.  I smoked for 1.5 and cooked for a total of 5 hrs.  I found the thicker pieces on the middle rack , they were a bit soft still. Lower rack next time. Kenzy did mention I might want to swap out the burner that is in it, and put one of those stove top burners to have better heat.  Hence why I am making fish cakes brother from this batch."
