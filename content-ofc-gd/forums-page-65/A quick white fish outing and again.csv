Did not take long to get the first one hooked on the meegs and on the stringer. While Im doing that, the screen is lighting up. Also, fish are breaking the surface all around me. Drop the meegs and bang. Another. Im thinking ok lets just release and play til time to go. I went 7/7 in 2 hours. Kept the last one to make my 2 limit. One is being marinaded in cilantro,lemon,smoke paprika and sriracha for wraps tonight.  On the fence to put on the smoker for 2 hours then finish in the oven. Just for smoke flavor. The other was dropped off to a old friend.  	Crazy action.   "
