Might also check out point pelee since I'm close by anyways. Looks like best place to wet a line would be at the wheatley harbour. What should I expect to catch at this time of the year? What bait should I use? minnows?  I know worms are the easiest but not sure of the goby situation on erie and would hate to weed out through a bunch of gobies. Not planning to cast and retrieve, rather just simple split shot and hook off the bottom. Peaceful fishing in other words . Also is the south pier better or the north pier? Praying the rain holds off for this weekend  Thanks"
