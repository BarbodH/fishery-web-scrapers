1028077,smitty55,2018-05-08 17:41:00,928,"Bill many folks just use a frayed rope with no hook so the gar's teeth get caught up in the rope thinking that it is a legal method, which it is not.  Cheers"
1028081,BillM,2018-05-08 18:08:00,17367,"Yeah, I'm familiar with the rope method"
1028082,G.mech,2018-05-08 18:19:00,830,I've seen a few TV fishing shows and read lots of articles in magazines written by some reputable anglers where they've used this method....surprised they were never called on it.   I never really knew there was a rule about or a debate either I guess.
1028083,aplumma,2018-05-08 18:27:00,6896,If you do use a rope lure please take the time to remove all of the fibers before releasing them otherwise they can not feed or breath correctly. Art

1028105,G.mech,2018-05-08 22:40:00,830,Yes....but I'm not posting links.  Google it and you'll see lots!

1028231,John Bacon,2018-05-11 15:17:00,3277,"Looking at the quotes from the regulations summary (see below).  The rope lure would seem to fit the definition of angling rather than 'non-angling methods'.  According to the regulations, angling require a line; it doesn't mention hook.  	Non-angling methods of capturing fish include: dip nets, seine nets, spears, and bow & arrow.  The rope lure certainly doesn't fit any of those.  	Based on what I see on the summary of regulations, I would interpret the rope lure as 'angling' rather than a 'non-angling method of capturing fish' As per the regulations summary: Angling – Angling means fishing with a line that is held in the hand or attached to a rod that is held in the hand or closely attended. Residents and non-Canadian residents with a valid recreational fishing licence may fish with one dip net, one seine net, one spear or a bow and arrow for the species and during the periods outlined below.

1028259,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-12 13:14:00,8243,We fished for Gator Gar in south Florida using knitting yarn wrapped and tied around the shank of a large sized bait holder hook with the sharp end of the hook cut off. I don't know how that would be interpreted as it is a hook so to speak.
