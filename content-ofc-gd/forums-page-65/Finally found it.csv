1028430,wkrp,2018-05-15 22:32:00,656,After a long search for touch up paint for my 2002 Lund I finally found a supplier close to home. IÂ  took the paint code to Carquest and they were able to get it for me the same day. I ordered two spray cans and picked them up the next day. WOO HOO the old gal gets a face job
