1028447,Lape0019,2018-05-16 13:41:00,647,"See, that makes sense to me. The few times I have ever been stopped by the OPP(again, Marine unit), they have never once looked in the livewell or asked me about the fish. Only if I had a fishing license and operators card. They would also check for safety equipment. The situation definitely sucks no matter how you look at it but other than a badge, I am almost certain that cop had no more authority than OI did. If she would have gone up to the person fishing, the badge may have made a difference but so could have calling the tip line."
1028463,KawarthaAngler,2018-05-16 16:02:00,273,"I believe if stopped on the water: OPP: check for valid boating license, alcohol (drinking and driving) and mandatory safety equipment MNR Enforcement Officer: check for valid fishing license and to review the live well (any possession of fish and if valid size and season)  FYI ... I currently have this question out with a MNR Enforcement Officer that I'm an acquaintance with.  Will update when I have 'the word'."
1028473,AKRISONER,2018-05-16 17:16:00,5558,ive been asked for a fishing license by an OPP officer before?
1028475,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-16 17:42:00,10439,Bass are open year round in Lake O but I don't know if that includes up to Dunnville or not.Bass are open year round in Lake O. Not sure if that includes up to Dunnvile or not. Been a long time since I checked ON regs. 
1028480,dave524,2018-05-16 18:36:00,4508,"Your right, it's been a long time , the Grand River / Dunnville flows into Lake Erie and there is a closed season there."
1028481,AKRISONER,2018-05-16 18:39:00,5558,huh? are you saying on the US side? cause definitely not on the ontario side
1028483,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-16 18:58:00,10439,LOL yeah. A long time
1028490,John Bacon,2018-05-16 23:00:00,3277,No they aren't. 
1028491,misfish,2018-05-16 23:27:00,29133,"That is  No they ,are not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1028492,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-16 23:34:00,8243,There was a time Walleye was open all year on the Grand up to the Caledonia Dam at least. Now it is closed on that river including Bass until the openner. Erie has open season all year for Walleye but Bass is not. It looks like the OPP do not have the power to enforce the On. fishing regs. as I interpret what has been said here. I guess the easiest way to confirm that is to ask one the next time I am in a Tim Hortons
1028493,SirCranksalot,2018-05-17 01:01:00,3291,"Rudely interrupting coffee breaks will get you nowhere, OI!!"
1028495,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-17 01:34:00,10439,Unless you ply them with an eclair!!!!
1028496,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-17 02:10:00,8243,So the OPP can enforce the Ont. Fishing Regs. or they can't? 2 schools of thought based on comments here. I think I'll just ask the next time I am in Hortons and interrupt their safety meeting. They sure have quite a few safety meetings there. I bet they don't have a consensus.
1028499,chris.brock,2018-05-17 02:40:00,4053,"This is from an article in the Owen Sound Suntimes, it could be just a local thing or it could be totally wrong but here it is-  When police or conservation officers check boaters -- both are authorized to enforce fish and game laws as well as boating safety laws -- they look for safety equipment and ""alcohol for sure."""
1028507,G.mech,2018-05-17 12:01:00,830,"From what I have been able to figure out, I think the answer is that the all police officers including the OPP and CO's are authorized by law to enforce these rules but each municipality has their own agreement with the OPP as to which laws & Acts they are required to enforce within their jurisdiction.  There is a basic minimum service level that includes Criminal Code, Highway Traffic Act, etc but others such as By-law enforcment, Fish & Wildlife, Federal boating laws, Liquor License Act,etc are discretionary and the scope of service is determined by the local municipal Police Service Board. (if you really want to read more about this look up Police Services Act sections 5 & 10 but it's pretty dry reading).    The extra enforcement requires special training & equipment and therefore costs extra money which may explain why you are more likely to see OPP enforcement in more remote areas since the larger centres simply don't want to pay for the extra service.    I doubt that any officer would have much support from their superiors if they stuck their nose in where it didn't belong and the situation went sideways.... maybe she deserves a pass on this one(?) EDIT:  I just sent an e-mail inquiry to the OPP so see if they can shed any light on this,   I will post there response if I get one."
1028519,KawarthaAngler,2018-05-17 17:06:00,273,"The word from my Enforcement Officer acquaintance .....  Conservation Officers (CO) for the most part focus on mandated legislation......natural resources related. However, CO’s also enforce the boating regulations, alcohol, etc. We can arrest impaired boaters and do on numerous occasions. OPP are also considered to be CO’s under the FWCA. Not Fisheries Officers...........so they will and can ask you for your fishing licence.  They don’t look at numbers, size, and seasons very often. So even though it may not be known by every police officer ... since not everyone knows every potential element of their job ... they can certainly enforce fishing legislation, just as Enforcement Officers can arrest and impound impaired drivers."
1028531,Tjames09,2018-05-18 00:29:00,664,That’s what I was saying above. Most of the fishing regulations come from the fisheries act not the FWCA
1028543,dave524,2018-05-18 12:29:00,4508,"A lot of the hunting regs are from the Migratory Game Bird Regulations, watch for the boys with the yellow stripes down their legs, "" They always get their man "" , . I believe in some provinces they are the police in rural areas."
1028559,Lape0019,2018-05-18 15:51:00,647,"So basically, that cop could have went up to the individual and asked to see the fishing license if she so felt like getting out of her car but that is about it. Well, at least that is what I am getting from the info provided."
1028560,KawarthaAngler,2018-05-18 16:03:00,273,"Yes.  It's possible not all police officers are aware that they are within their power to enforce fishing reg's.  Many probably don't know what the different fishing reg's are and simply stay away from it.  But for this officer to go over and discuss license and what is in season to what is not when looking at their bucket of fish, they certainly could and noone could question it."
1028214,Woodsman,2018-05-11 01:16:00,1286,"OK Bill you have to explain this one to me. First off there is no such thing as a possession season that I know of. There are daily catch & possession limits. Daily catch limits have seasons but possession limits do not. Do you mean the season was open with a 0 daily catch limit? Catch limits are fish allowed to be caught & retained daily. Possession limits apply to fish you have on hand or in storage, in transit or anywhere. No season on possession limits. But if caught when a daily catch limit is zero you can not retain them as part of your possession limit."
1028215,Terry,2018-05-11 01:25:00,14456,"Here is one  trout is open but you can't keep any   Only one line may be used when angling through the ice. 	Lake Trout open from Jan. 1 - Sept. 30. 	Lake Trout S – 0 and C – 0 from Jan.1 – Feb. 7, Apr. 1 – June 23 & Sept. 1 – Sept. 30. 	Lake Trout S – 1 and C – 1, must be less than 61 cm (24 in.) And muskie with a C license"
1028216,BillM,2018-05-11 01:32:00,17367,"Woodsman, FMZ14 look in the exceptions for Parry Sound...   lake trout regs (Terry posted it above)..     Perhaps I explained it with words that were confusing?    Should have used daily catch limits instead of possession I guess    Not like I keep those buggers anyhow, lol."
1028222,AKRISONER,2018-05-11 11:40:00,5558,"I remember the first time we went fishing for lakers in parry sound and the old man and i were lost with the regs...I had never seen anything like it either. Literally some of the tightest regs in the entire book. The ""no fish"" border on the imaginary line across the bay. The 0 possession limit and the size restriction during the keeping months...you gotta have the regs totally on lock if you want to fish there."
1028237,BillM,2018-05-11 20:33:00,17367,"Yup, and the lighthouse isn't where the boundary starts, lol.   I wonder how many people they nail that think it is."
1028238,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-11 21:36:00,8243,"There are fish sanctuaries out here on Erie at the east end of the lake and in Long Point I am familiar with. If you go by the regs. you had better know each and every county road, residential road and landmark and have a very good GPS to know when you are in them. Ridiculous if you ask me. Example, 200 meters SW from the old Marina at Butter Rd. to 400 meters due south from the Old Billingsly Farm which has the Red Barn with the green Cockatoo wind vane on it, in a direct line NE of the Conservation Area next to the Golf Course. OK I'm making it up but it doesn't sound that far fetched. Forgot to report a fishing morning on The Grand south of the Dunnville Dam. Nothing to report, got skunked, plenty of pictures of no fish, see below."
1028244,SirCranksalot,2018-05-11 22:59:00,3291,"You are so rude, OI!  Interrupting a cop having coffee! Shame shame!!"
1028390,Mister G,2018-05-15 13:02:00,1429,I am guessing it was her coffee break and when that was over she was going to lunch and since she was late for work that day she planned on going home early to make it up. Just another day behind the badge.
1028391,dave524,2018-05-15 13:29:00,4508,The bass sanctuaries out of Port Colborne are just as bad.
1028394,Mister G,2018-05-15 14:33:00,1429,Do you think bass  sanctuaries  are necessary in Lake Erie. NYS bass fishing is as good if not better and they have early bass seasons.
1028397,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-15 15:08:00,8243,"Actually Dave that is exactly the area I was thinking about, the explanation of the boundaries are absolutely ridiculous. At least the Bass sanctuary in Long Point Bay are marked with buoys."
1028399,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-15 15:20:00,8243,
1028401,AKRISONER,2018-05-15 15:41:00,5558,"thats just the structure available, has nothing to do with the regs.  I can assure you that allowing the bass to spawn basically undisturbed has a positive effect on bass populations. Go fish a heavily pressured lake like the kawarthas and then take a trip to the north eastern side of georgian bay where the smallmouth population is virtually undisturbed all year aside from a couple of anglers...People think their fishing is good on their respective lake, they have no bloody idea.  ive been lucky enough to fish a lot of lakes from BC, to manitoba to ontario all the way down to alabama...The best fishing is always where the least people are. Theres a balance for sure though, colder water means slower growing fish...there is definitely a sweet spot though."
1028406,dave524,2018-05-15 16:11:00,4508,"The Port Boundaries , to my knowledge are unchanged in over 50 years since dad would take me and rent a 16 foot cedar strip from Ray's Boat Livery for 50 cents a hour or 3 bucks for the day, he would put his green 5 1/2 horse Johnson on the back and we would put out to the foghorn or if he was real adventurous the pilot boat buoy and troll for Yellow Pickeral. The locals should  have a pretty good handle on the boundaries by now. 6 pounders are more common now than 4's back then."
1028411,AKRISONER,2018-05-15 17:21:00,5558,you ever drive through there with the electronics on? i think the fish know where the boundary is too lol
1028418,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-15 18:57:00,8243,I always wondered how NY State Smallmouth knew when they crossed the border and became Ontario Smallmouth. Getting nesting Bass to bite isn't as easy as it sounds. From watching the Smallies on their nests from the deck they will feed late in the day and then and only then do they leave the beds.
1028421,AKRISONER,2018-05-15 18:59:00,5558,"you gotta piss em off enough, just like a river run salmon, its not that they are eating, its that youve made them mad enough to lash out lol"
1028422,Lape0019,2018-05-15 19:18:00,647,"Going back to the original post, is it confirmed that ALL O.P>p officers can enforce MNR regulations? I was under the impression that it was only the marine units that could enforce SOME of the regs. Like, mostly the safe boating regs. Anytime I have ever read anything to do with poaching, it always seems to be handled by a CO. I have seen CO's work with the marine units as well but I have never heard of a traffic cop providing a citation for an MNR regulation. I have been looking when I have a bit of time to see if I can find anything that supports the OPP officers enforcing the regs and I haven't found anything yet."
1028432,G.mech,2018-05-15 22:47:00,830,"BINGO.  It depends on the OPP contract with each municipality.  Not all OPP are required or trained to enforce hunting and fishing violations which is why they often work in tandem with the OMNR&F officers.  That said, it's far easier for the OFC community in general to toss these folks under the bus an ask questions later so let's not let facts get in the way of a perfectly good lynch mob."
1028436,chris.brock,2018-05-15 22:59:00,4053," If that's the case, the grumpy officer could have politely explained that instead of just giving OI a smart azz reply. Still a poor job on her part IMO."
1028437,dave524,2018-05-15 23:02:00,4508,"When I in the Port Rowan / Long Point area in the 70's the RCMP did a lot of the Migratory Game Bird Enforcement, they were obviously well trained in waterfowl identification, the regulations and had waders, boats , really well equipped for the task . On occasion they would even roadblock the causeway and pull over any hunters for a vehicle search during duck season."
1028438,G.mech,2018-05-15 23:20:00,830,And OI could have called the TIPS line .....same outcome anyway; they can't react effectively either.
1028441,chris.brock,2018-05-16 02:29:00,4053,"she could have reacted effectively even if she can't enforce fish stuff, she could have talked to the poacher and threatened to call a CO, I bet those bass would have ended up released, instead she just grabbed a coffee and went cruising, doing nothing, accomplishing nothing except pissing off OI"
1028444,Woodsman,2018-05-16 10:40:00,1286,"Here's your answer found in the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. Section 87 (1) The Minister may appoint a person or class of persons as conservation officers for the purposes of this Act. 1997, c. 41, s. 87 (1). (2) The following persons are conservation officers for the purposes of this Act by virtue of their office: 1. A police officer or First Nations Constable appointed under the Police Services Act."
1028446,Tjames09,2018-05-16 12:53:00,664," The laws for fishing are actually under the Fisheries Act and the regulation under that act called The Ontario Fisheries Regulations. Fish and Wildlife Act is more for hunting and just fishing licenses. The Ontario Fisheries Regulations is where you find over limit, OOS, sanctuaries, etc. "
1028152,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-10 01:05:00,8243,"What a beauty of a day. I was in Dunnville doing some business. I went down to the Grand River to have a Tim's. There were a few folks fishing. I talked to a gent all hooked up Carp fishing. Next to them were a couple fishing. The gent gets a fish on, it's a small Smallmouth Bass. I watch him put it on a stringer and hang it over the dock wall, His wife gets one, repeat. Now I'm interested, they have 2 stringers full of small Smalies. What do I do? Start the conversation and get the ""Me no speak English."" Or let it go. Just about as I was about to leave an OPP cruiser pulls up so she can have her Timmy's. I walk over to her car and mention these folks are poaching. Her reply in a very sarcastic tone. ""Do I look like an MNR employee.? "" Conversation over, I walked away. I left pissed off, still am. I have her badge number. What would you do after that?  Report her and look over my shoulder everyday? I dunno."

They may still be doing it, I’m not sure. The no speak English line is always spoken “where they did learn that line”?can’t win my friends NO respect for our laws! People actually line up for Tim’s.

I could charge 12 bucks but my overhead isn't much."
1028161,Woodsman,2018-05-10 02:05:00,1286,"Your response should have been "" No you don't look like a MNR employee but you sure look like a Conservation Officer.

1028162,GBW,2018-05-10 02:39:00,8460,Amazing answer! I would still call it in to the tips line no matter what if you are 100% a law is being broken and in this case SMB a law is broken.

We have about 40 or so OPP here in Haldimand, not positive with that number, probably too high. Everyone knows everyone pretty well. I guarantee if I Rat on one I am getting pulled over for doing 84 in an 80 every day. Is the hassle to me worth it? I say no way no how. It's not like they are ever going to investigate the poaching anyway. If any of them wanted to do the task of a C.O. all they have to do is go down to the river or ramp at Pt. Maitland and look in some buckets. It makes me angry, very very angry.Even a call to the MNR is a waste of time but I am going to call them regardless tomorrow and report it. I can't complain unless I do my part. Off topic of course. We have been pricing new flooring for here for a few months. From Burlington to St. Catherines. I bet I have wasted 2 tanks of gas at least at $125.00 per with my dear Lady pricing stuff, need a good deal right? The best price I got is in Dunnville today, Coopers flooring about 25 minutes from our shack. And I used to bug my Dad for driving from store to store all day for the best price on toilet paper. Am I becoming my Father? I hope not but I think it is evident I surely am. Maybe not a bad thing as he just turned 91after laying brick for 38 years in a Steel Plant."
1028171,woodenboater,2018-05-10 12:05:00,2277,I don't think you'd get blowback from reporting the officer but you also don't know what kind of day she's had. Might be  a reason she was short with you. I'd keep it in your back pocket for now...
1028172,Fisherman,2018-05-10 12:48:00,7201,"If you're not going to report it, then there's no point in gathering opinions whether you should or not."

I would have taken their stringer and kindly released the fish for them. No speak english is a Bull excuse nowadays. Most of the no speak english crowd can understand just fine, its just PURE IGNORANCE.  S."
1028175,AKRISONER,2018-05-10 13:12:00,5558,"Ol you should have called the MNR immediately. The response you got from the cop is friggin ridiculous... A couple years back i was at severn falls and sure enough there was a polish guy blatantly poaching in the heavily marked ""no fishing"" sanctuary. I called the MNR and we were able to provide them with his description and license plate. You never end up finding out what happens to these folks but maybe a stop by and a freezer check happened on buddy? I am sure if there is an actual CO nearby they would have no problem swinging by."

1028180,dave524,2018-05-10 13:44:00,4508,"Not sure I want the police enforcing any more than trespass when it comes to fishing and hunting, sadly they don't know the regs in most cases and on the roads they let you go 55 in a 50 with no ticket, guess you would be OK with 55 perch on a 50 perch limit too. When was the last time a CO pulled you over for a traffic offence ?"
1028181,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-10 13:46:00,8243,I called the MNR satellite office in Long Point and left a message. The reason I asked opinions here is to get feedback from others if they have had the same experience and what the results were. Cops have enough on their plates trying to get their heads around the Highway Traffic Act let alone Fishing and Hunting regs. Maybe a good task for By-Law enforcement.
1028182,BillM,2018-05-10 14:26:00,17367,"Call MNR TIPS, report what you saw and hope someone gets down there. I was fishing out in Gbay when I got pulled over by the OPP, I told him what I was fishing for and he said they were out of season.  I had to bring up the regs and show him that the possession season was over, but I was still legally allowed to fish for them until the end of the month.   He wasn't very happy about that, lol."
1028183,chris.brock,2018-05-10 15:08:00,4053,"If I was in the right mood, that's probably what I would have done too. Years ago we saw a bunch of small OOS bass in a bucket.
