1021199,chris.brock,2018-01-14 03:34:00,4053,"  He's got 3 camps so far and is looking for more. There's a lot of crap for sale on a lot of dud lakes. The 3 Jason picked up are really cool, each in their own way. There's always pike, walleye and bonus brook trout at any camp. 2 Mile is a drive to on the Little Current River. Lots of water,fly in quality fishing and privacy at a dirt cheap rate. Balson Lake is a sleeper cell in brook trout country with access to the section of the Dusey River and lake Mike has fished. Ogoki River has access to Ogoki and Kayedon Lakes, lots of legendary water to explore. Jason, Chuck, Adam, me and a couple others are going to Ogoki in late August this year, it should be epic. I dug up some of my old Ogoki pictures to pump the guys up.         2 Mile is probably intriguing to some guys here because it's cheap, it's fly in quality fishing and fly in quality privacy but at a cheap price and when you run out of beer you can just waste half a day and go get more. Show Jason some love. Oh yeah, Jason wanted me to mention what song I was listening to at the time, that would be luke bryan  "
1021209,crappieperchhunter,2018-01-14 13:33:00,2582,Thanks for sharing this Chris. Great to hear someone with a passion... working up the nerve...rolling up there sleeves and  jumping in with both feet to give it a go.  Best of luck to Jason and his lady on this journey.
1021210,chris.brock,2018-01-14 14:33:00,4053,"oops, forgot his website https://namegosikaaoutfitters.com/ Namegosikaa is Ojibway for where the trout are"
1021211,kickingfrog,2018-01-14 16:07:00,8333,Saved for later consideration. I see moose hunting on the site but for me a September fish and grouse hunt would be my number one option.
1021219,chris.brock,2018-01-14 20:30:00,4053, 2 Mile would work for that Rob. There's lots of logging roads and trails and nobody around. Brook Trout are closed after Labour Day though.    
1021220,kickingfrog,2018-01-14 20:57:00,8333,Maybe it's just as well. If there was brookies and grouse I might become a squatter.
1021224,SirCranksalot,2018-01-14 23:54:00,3291,Now if I could get my buddies interested in making that drive I'd be on my way to Nakina----again!!
1021232,AKRISONER,2018-01-15 13:59:00,5558,one can only dream....sigh
1021318,ckewley,2018-01-18 13:22:00,699,Oh man I'm PSYCHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1021352,chris.brock,2018-01-18 23:47:00,4053," 2 Mile is as good as any fly in lake in the area. Guys are talking about 100 fish days being common fishing at the base of the rapids. What do you mean your outpost days are over Chad, what happened? Yeah Chris, I'm pumped too, sucks we have a 6 month wait though, lol."
1021360,chris.brock,2018-01-19 02:31:00,4053,"it sucks to hear that Chad, I know how you love to do stuff outdoors, take care of yourself"
1021367,Chuck Enwinde,2018-01-19 07:17:00,247,Me too.  Dis gonna be fun.  Someone might need to humor me for a bit while I try to catch whities.  Bet they've never even seen a Meegs jig.
1021463,Old Ironmaker,2018-01-21 04:28:00,8243,"I wish your pal the very best wishes both for his family and himself. I too have been told you are ""nuts"" or you ""can't do it"". Naysayers need not apply. A trip up there before I hit my best before date would be fantastic. Where does a commercial airline fly to that is closest to Nakina?"
1021478,Jmeyer,2018-01-21 15:07:00,83,"Thunder bay is the closest airport then it's about 2 and a half hour drive to nakina, the drive to camp is another hour beyond town. Thank you for the kind words, your right I've heard all those things but don't forget the mighty oak was once a nut like me!"
1021628,chris.brock,2018-01-23 02:49:00,4053,"Maybe we'll see ya in Nakina, we're at Ogoki the week after. You guys are talking whities, I'm thinking big pike and fat brook trout, lol."
1021749,Jmeyer,2018-01-24 22:14:00,83,Here's some pics of the two mile camp on the Little Current river.   
1021853,Jmeyer,2018-01-26 03:42:00,83,That spot is about 2km down stream there's two ways to get there by canoe or trail. You will get all the GPS sweet spots when you get there.
1021900,maker a laker,2018-01-26 20:38:00,33,"Guys, Nice camp, decently maintained over the years, until the ice got the dock. Rocky beach is fine for daily launches of boats. Fish numbers noted above are real from my 4-5 week long trips there over the past decade. Watch for golden eagles when you go all the way upstream to the rapids. Bald eagles hang out downstream from the camp. Great place, I plan to book again in the next few years. "
1023042,brkygetr,2018-02-16 16:20:00,425,Hey guys. Thinking about booking a moose hunt with Jason this year at Balson. Anyone have any first hand experience at this camp?
1023164,Jmeyer,2018-02-19 13:57:00,83,"I only know of two people that have been there, Mike Borger and another guy that wanted I hunt there this  year that I couldn't accommodate because of a lack of tags. I can send you his number"
1023270,Zenfish,2018-02-21 12:46:00,7,The two-mile lake outpost camp looks awesome. I have talked to Jason about booking here in 2019 with my wife for an anniversary trip. Anxious to hear reports from the upcoming season and see more pics!
1027350,Jds63,2018-04-25 12:50:00,1365,i hear ya ... that feeling never gets old .... any chance to head north on a fishing trip always makes feel anxious ... and Jason is a great guy to deal with
1028177,Jds63,2018-05-10 13:19:00,1365,wow ... time is flying ... looking forward to hearing about your adventure !!!!
