1027938,PUMP KNOWS,2018-05-06 01:50:00,937,I've been playing around with a underwater camera last year and managed to get some cool footage. I hope you guys enjoy      
1027943,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-06 03:23:00,8243,"Man that is some great video, good on ya Pump. I can't tell with the depth of field how much line you had out. Doesn't look like much, how much? Not that many years ago you would need Professional video equipment at big bucks to get that in a lesser resolution. Good job. Pump knows video for sure. I have to add that shad at 6 minutes is very life like. We spent many hours underwater diving watching bait and fish chasing it, that shad works fantastically. Almost exactly what I saw many times underwater. You should sell it to the manufacturer. Too late now I guess. You video guys shouldn't be to quick to post it publically unless you copyright it. Another discussion I imagine."
1027947,Musky Plug,2018-05-06 14:03:00,398,Great videos! Interesting to see how fish react to different baits. Those look like some pigs too. Can I ask where did you get those swim baits from? They look sweet.
1027953,misfish,2018-05-06 15:39:00,29133,Thats alot of coverage and editing. Thanks for taking the time. Enjoyed.
1027963,OhioFisherman,2018-05-06 17:49:00,6623,Cool videos!
1027964,OhioFisherman,2018-05-06 17:56:00,6623,I think some of them are European baits? https://www.lureshop.eu/
1027967,BillM,2018-05-06 18:06:00,17367,"Awesome camera work man!!   One reason why I always vary my retrieve with pike, they love to follow nose up to the bait."
1027992,farsider,2018-05-06 21:40:00,456,Some Westin lures used among others.  JB's had some last year and North Bay Outfitters also carries some. https://www.northbayoutfitters.com/product/westin-percy-the-perch/ https://www.northbayoutfitters.com/product/westin-mike-the-pike/ 
1028033,PUMP KNOWS,2018-05-07 19:43:00,937,Thanks guys.  I have a few more video's as well that I'll post in the near future. Some of the lures can be ordered online through here - Strike pro shad jr and Flatnose shad https://www.kanalgratis.se/en/  Yup.  I have more vids of westin lures I'll post in the near future
1028139,Snidley,2018-05-09 17:00:00,620,Very good footage. Shows how close they follow without biting. Those Scandinavian lures look awsome especially the Westin ones. Heres some Rapalas that we don't get here https://www.normark.fi/kalastus/vieheet/rapala-vieheet They have videos when you click on the picture of the top 3 lures. The Scoop is a copy of a Luhr Jensen Quiver which I have and have fished for salmon with no luck. Maybe pike is the proper quarry which would be weird for a Luhr Jensen product
1028140,AKRISONER,2018-05-09 17:02:00,5558,been following all of these on the gram. Really cool stuff.
1028170,jonasdry,2018-05-10 11:57:00,63,What camera are you using and how do you rig it up?
1028187,PUMP KNOWS,2018-05-10 15:47:00,937,I contacted Rapala Canada about those 3 lures a few months back.  They told me that they aren't sure if they will bring them in to the Canadian market and to check back in fall.  I would like to get my hands on them if sold locally.  Cheers!  Water wolf underwater camera and you tie it on your line and add a leader with your choice of lure.
