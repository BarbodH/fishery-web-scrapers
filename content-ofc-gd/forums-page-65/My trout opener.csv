1027589,Dutch01,2018-04-28 22:59:00,1431,"Well, today was nothing short of amazing! I started the day with some friends at a river east of the GTA. It wasn't as crowded as I expected and everyone was pretty well behaved ?. We saw loads of fish caught, and caught a few of our own too. Had I quit there, it would have already been a great day.  When I got home I decided to check the ""backyard"" (I live on a Rouge trib) and managed to catch a real beauty! This was <100 yards from my back patio ?.      Best. Trout. Opener. Ever!"
1027592,huzzsaba,2018-04-29 00:02:00,884,Nice! hopefully will get out soon as well. I guess you will now be spending more time in your backyard lol. did you just use roe bag and split shot?
1027601,Dutch01,2018-04-29 04:37:00,1431,For sure I'll be spending more time in my backyard. Starting tomorrow! We were catching them using just a row bag and small splits under a float. I'm going to have to tie some more in the morning.
1027602,LittleWorm,2018-04-29 05:47:00,122,"Dutch01, IS this in Cobourg? Many years ago we use to go up to Cobourg and rent private land off a farmer who has a stream run through his land. He had it all sectioned off and it was really nice. We paid $10 per person per day and there was usually 7-10 of us just in our section. I can't even imagine how much money he hade every year from opening weekend with all the land he had and the amount of people he rented it our to. I haven't been up there in 20 some years. "
1027606,Rod Caster,2018-04-29 12:10:00,5784,Cool. Wish I had tribs with rainbows nearby.
1027607,Rizzo,2018-04-29 12:49:00,4754,that's awesome to have that in your backyard!
1027612,Dutch01,2018-04-29 13:59:00,1431,"No it wasn't Cobourg, I guess that narrows it down some. No time like the present to get back at it. The ""backyard"" is in east GTA."
1027613,Dutch01,2018-04-29 14:00:00,1431,I wish I had some of the fishing down here that you have up there so call it even. I still remember those walleye you put us on!
1027614,Dutch01,2018-04-29 14:01:00,1431,"No doubt! In truth, the fish are not there in any numbers most years by the opener. This year's cold and late spring has kept them around for me"
1027645,misfish,2018-04-29 22:01:00,29133,Break the fly rod out and make it a challenge. LOL  Nice.
1027657,Dutch01,2018-04-30 11:14:00,1431,No thanks! I have enough challenges as it is and I already get enough flak for not using a 'pin! ?
1027664,misfish,2018-04-30 14:09:00,29133,
1027668,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-30 15:40:00,2585,great pics!
1027681,GBW,2018-04-30 21:25:00,8460,Nice fish and so close to home.  I'd have stayed in had I seen that black cloud in pic's 2 and 3...
1027885,Thrilla,2018-05-04 23:10:00,164,Went 5/10 on a Huron trib opening day. Surprised at the lack of people. Not a bad thing lol
1027915,Dutch01,2018-05-05 18:09:00,1431,"I am quite the artiste, no? ? I was pleasantly surprised that the Ganny wasn't too busy for us either. Sounds like you had good fishing yourself. 5/10 would be a banner day for me!"
1027916,PUMP KNOWS,2018-05-05 18:18:00,937,Good stuff Dutch!  Catching a fish in your backyard must've been the cherry on top.
1028020,Dutch01,2018-05-07 16:42:00,1431,"Got another nice one yesterday. Saturday I start fishing walleye on the kayak so not sure if I'll fish Steelhead again this spring. If not, this was a great way to end my season!  "
1028043,misfish,2018-05-07 23:47:00,29133,Nice . Get that yak up here for some Simcoe laker fun. I will guide ya. Free of charge. LOL
1028054,Dutch01,2018-05-08 02:41:00,1431,That is an offer only a fool would refuse - PM sent!
1028149,Moosebunk,2018-05-10 00:54:00,3970,Some great looking pink cheeky monkeys for the spring. Nice!!!
