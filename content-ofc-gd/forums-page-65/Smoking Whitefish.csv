1028606,akaShag,2018-05-20 12:48:00,2073,"About a gallon of cold water, about a cup of salt, about a cup of sugar (white or brown), mix well.  Put the fillets in the brine skin side UP, and into the fridge for at least 12 hours, but no more than 24.  Take the fillets out of the brine, lay them to dry on paper towel or clean newspaper, for about an hour.  Hit your smoker grills with some PAM or other non-stick spray, lay the fillets skin side down, and smoke for a couple pans of smoke.  Whitie fillets a half-inch thick will need about four hours in MY smoker, yours may vary. You can add endless extras to your brine (lemon juice, soya sauce, garlic,,,) and you can also dust the fillets with sugar/spices before they go into the smoker. Doug PS)  Some folks RINSE their fillets after they take them out of the brine.  I don't."
