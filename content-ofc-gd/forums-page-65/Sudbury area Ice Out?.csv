1028035,Can_38,2018-05-07 19:55:00,152,Just curious if anyone up in the Sudbury area could share an ice out report?
1028036,misfish,2018-05-07 20:12:00,29133,"I can tell you there is still 28"" on the lakes in Port Loring. I only know this as buddy wanted to get his boat up there this weekend. LOL Aint going to happen for a couple of weeks."
1028039,Rodnreel,2018-05-07 20:38:00,11,"I'm on a small lake, French River area.   Still have 6in. of ice as of Saturday."
1028040,AKRISONER,2018-05-07 20:44:00,5558,"back bays in Pointe Au baril are still iced up. We lost our main ice last thursday, but anywhere that doesnt have a lot of current are still locked. Might be a few more weeks before ice out in sudbury."
1028050,northernboy,2018-05-08 02:13:00,13,"I am on a mid sized lake in Sudbury, ice is 100' offshore from the house, will be gone in the next few days.  All lakes that I have seen have crappy honey comb ice"

1028065,Can_38,2018-05-08 14:42:00,152,"Thanks for all of the replies.  Anyone else concerned about walleye opener having open water on the small / medium lakes.  I suppose if you live in the area it is what it is, but for folks like me who have invested $ into lodging & vacation days etc.. I am concerned."
1028074,Rodnreel,2018-05-08 17:18:00,11,When are you heading up ? Opener ?
1028084,Can_38,2018-05-08 19:29:00,152,Yes.  May 18-21 & yes I know opener isn't until the 19th.
1028090,Joeytier,2018-05-08 20:25:00,3990,"That area will be wide open by the weekend, mostly open now.  North of 17, there will be remnants of ice on many lakes on the long weekend, but most should be navigable.   Small lakes should be mostly open by the end of this weekend.  Big lakes like Temagami and Kipawa are still pretty tight, Nipissing should be wide open in 4-5 days."
1028101,northernboy,2018-05-08 22:13:00,13,"Ice went out on my lake, McFarlane, today.  Also saw Nepiwan and and it is ice free.  Lake Wanapitei looked like honeycomb ice on Saturday.  Nice to see the blue water again"
1028468,Dara,2018-05-16 16:39:00,3052,Ice is out up here in the Sault in Echo bay. Water is so cold though walleye weren't there yesterday...lots of little pike though
1028469,misfish,2018-05-16 16:40:00,29133,"Yup, buddy got the call yesterday. Open water. That ice melted fast."
1028482,Can_38,2018-05-16 18:57:00,152,"Thanks everyone.  I'll be on the road tomorrow morning, can't wait"
