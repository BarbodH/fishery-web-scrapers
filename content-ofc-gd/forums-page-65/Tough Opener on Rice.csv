1028293,Jacques,2018-05-13 01:32:00,97,"Maiden voyage today in me and my buddy's new boat.  Decided to christen her on Rice and it was pretty tough sledding. Water temps were 58-60 degrees.  Guys were stacked on the usual weed beds, with slower than usual growth and little to show.  Reports of OOS Smallies and few walleye.  We fished a few holes in 14-17 FOW as well, some shore line, river mouth.  Jigged with minnows, worms, bucktails and lures of most description.  A few taps, one good hit, no takers. Wondering how everyone else fared or if it was just us.  A late spawn?"
1028299,captpierre,2018-05-13 02:23:00,2521,Couldn’t face the cold this morning early. Got out around 10 on Pigeon. Couldn’t find any green weeds. Landed a solid smallie  on a jerk bait. No eyes. Not many boats out.  No panfish at the dock yet. I always struggle in May.
1028303,bigugli,2018-05-13 03:45:00,6138,We got pike and walleye on the Welland R this morning.  And yes it was a tough bite.
1028304,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-13 04:12:00,8243,"The spawn is late this year. I saw some shiner's trying to escape pre spawn Smallies today. The Bass will chase the minnows right to the beach. It is a few weeks late. Should be late with other gamefish too. Not a terrible winter but bad enough with a late ice out here on Erie. There was still piles of snow under the shadows of the Pine trees just 2 weeks ago. I look for buds to start on the Maple trees, that tells me it is pre sawn for Smallmouth and the big Cats are on the feed in the river."
1028308,dintymoore,2018-05-13 13:41:00,62,"Wife and I got one each, in slot Saturday afternoon, on Rice. 8-10 fow on wally divers"
1028339,BassMan11,2018-05-14 12:00:00,583,Up this way water temps were 53 on a small back lake. 8 Pike 5 OOS smallies and had 2 walleyes on but lost both. No fish was caught deeper than 12' in weedy area's.. Slow moving soft swimbaits were key as the fish were very lethargic.
1028342,Dutch01,2018-05-14 12:56:00,1431,"Water was only 50 degrees on Balsam, couldn't find any weeds anywhere. 1 pike, 3 oos bass is all we could find. I'm off to Stoney Saturday for a kayak club meet up. Hopefully things will heat up by then."
1028345,AKRISONER,2018-05-14 13:06:00,5558,"things were very slow last weekend as well, everything is a few weeks behind...we were finding walleye crappie and perch in winter patterns in 25 fow. A few pre spawn bass up shallow...depending on how the weather holds, bass opener might be absolutely insane with fish still on the beds."
1028347,Sinker,2018-05-14 13:32:00,8692,Hit rice last night 6:30-830 and went 3 for 4.  S.
1028353,Headhunter,2018-05-14 16:50:00,5703,"Hit Lady Simcoe Saturday morning with Fishnsled, with Perch as our goal. Found them in 12-15 fow, almost 100% males and aggressive! Ended up with about three pounds of fillets! HH"
1028354,captpierre,2018-05-14 16:57:00,2521,"I’m thinking the bait is still deep as you say. . Like I said nothing at our dock,  South shore. I tried north shore weed beds. Nada."
1028355,AKRISONER,2018-05-14 17:03:00,5558,"This was taken 6? days ago...(side note god i love down imaging, counting individual fish in a ball of bait? yes please) "
1028363,Sinker,2018-05-14 19:23:00,8692,"Try shallower. Inside weed edges. Warmest water. Most guys struggled with them this weekend, but I found them right where I always do on opener. No boats in sight. Think outside the box. Bait would be the last thing I look for on pigeon.  S."
1028365,captpierre,2018-05-14 19:44:00,2521,Ok. Thanks.  I’ll give it a try this weekend.
1028396,jimmer,2018-05-15 14:51:00,2730,"The bite was over by 10 am for us.  We ended the day with 11 walleye.  Some under, some over and 5 in the slot. Some oos season muskie and a gazillion large mouth that were everywhere."
1028398,Loonietoon,2018-05-15 15:19:00,1450,"Fished Rice all weekend out of Pinecrest Cottages, went 7 Pickeral 3 kept in slot caught  on Bigugli (Bruce) chartruse worm harnesses "" thanks Bruce"" and white twister tails white jig heads just outside the weeds 3 OOS Bass and some perch. Sorry no pic's forgot camera"
