Has anyone tried this style setup and can give some feedback about it? Thanks   "

1028219,BillM,2018-05-11 03:08:00,17367,"You aren't going to get that much forward thrust, when the motor is on and going foward, it's going to pivot and actually wedge that mount in super tight."
1028220,PickerelHunter,2018-05-11 04:17:00,100,"Awesome thanks for the replies guys. I left it as is, when I tightened it seemed to be very secure. Giving it a shot this weekend"
1028249,thatleetboy,2018-05-12 01:08:00,143,"Pickerel Hunter > I built one out of oak, just like the one in your picture, and have had no problems like you are concerned about. There is a little twisting at full speed, but like BillM says, it just wedges it in. I don't use a motor often, but it's great to have it available, should the occasion call for it. I had an extra long cable put on the Minn Kota so the battery could sit up near the bow.... Good Luck with the test!"
1028340,PickerelHunter,2018-05-14 12:28:00,100,"Thanks to everyone for their insight and comments.  Here's what I ended up with, worked like a charm.  Didn't go full speed on it as had no need but went up to 3 of 5. Having the hand knobs to tighten made it much easier than playing around with a wrench/socket.  Might add strips of rubber where the two pieces of wood clamp down on the gunwhale for added support. Even got into some brookies!   "
