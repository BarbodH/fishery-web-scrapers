453169,skeeter,2010-04-07 20:18:00,1907,"If your going to do this on any garage door, make sure the door is SOLID STEEL. and then set up a video camera so you can get the thief that TRIED to steal the car on video. this way when the ambulance hauls his butt to the hospital from his self inflicted injury's, you have proof that you didnt beat him half to death.  then send a copy of the video into funniest home videos and collect the $10,000 prize."
