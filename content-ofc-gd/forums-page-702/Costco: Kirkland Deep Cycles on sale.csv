453635,skeeter,2010-04-08 20:10:00,1907,"just an FYI on Kirkland batteries from Costco. my battery went kaput's on me in my Mazda mx3. i needed a battery and had to walk to Costco to get one. it was the closest place within walking distance. i pushed it home in a shopping cart. put it in the car, and the car fired right up. and it continued to fire up without a single problem for the next 4 years.  so i highly recommend there batteries for any application.
