453545,Afraz,2010-04-08 14:51:00,250,"Oh snap worms in our bellies, are these fish parasites dangerous to humans ? last thing i like watching is a creepy crawlie moving about in the flesh of the panfish i keep. I promise dmyself never to fish in Montreal ever again for this exact reason. Every single fish (perch, Bluegill, Bass) we caught from that one location had some trippy crap inside em, after we gutted and went ahead to filet em these things started moving. Freaked theheck outta me. All went in the garbage."
453581,suds,2010-04-08 16:51:00,70,This thread was making me really hungry until the left turn at the yellow grubs...  thanks...
453688,pikehunter,2010-04-08 23:01:00,1659," Wouldn't even a turd taste fine if it were beer battered?  I do trust the words of those who have dined on these colourful little fish, someday I will give in and bring some home for the table."
453693,MJIG,2010-04-08 23:14:00,227," Not if you're cooking the fish before you eat it. If you're eating them raw, there are definitely things ""out there"" that you wouldn't want. One of the creepiest of the lot, however, has apparently only had five human infestation cases confirmed ever - 3 from guys that ate their bait minnows   , and 2 from home-made sushi."
453700,GBW,2010-04-08 23:42:00,8460,"Duno about that, might get real soft and runny in the cooking process and I would sure hope the beer flavour took over..."
453709,Fisherpete,2010-04-09 00:31:00,1814,"You guys got it all wrong. The turd first has to be wrapped in cheese and bacon, THEN beer battered and served with a side dish of grubs (pretend they are corn).  HOW EXACTLY DID THIS POST GO THIS WAY?!?!?!?  Everyone leave their computers and go fishing immediately!!! For tasty sunfish LMAO!!!"
452847,Mykester,2010-04-07 00:30:00,241,"As a kid my dad would always tell me to throw them away, we deemed them as ""junk"" fish because they wouldn't let the perch to the hook. It could be that in the motherland they didn't have sunfish but perch were plentiful, as well as different species of panfish. And growing up, the only people I've seen taking these sunfish were white bucket fishermen. I've seen a few reports here with sunfish being kept. What's the final verdict?"
452857,Fisherpete,2010-04-07 00:41:00,1814,"You have been missing out... cold water sunnies are just as tasty as perch or crappie in my opinion... but what do i know BURP! Oh yeah, I just finished a plateful from yesterday!!!   When they are a good size (8""+) they are much easier to fillet."
452862,Syn,2010-04-07 00:47:00,519,Tastes great in beer batter!
452866,Sinker,2010-04-07 00:58:00,8692,"Hell yeah they're good eating!! If I could consistently catch them over 9"", I'd spend A LOT of time chasing them!!  IMO, they're better than crappies, but not as good as perch.  S."
452906,bigugli,2010-04-07 02:39:00,6138,"You are one deprived lad. Take a plate of slab sunfish over crappie any day. Flesh is also a little firmer than a crappie. As for the little hook robbing sunnies, my fish theiving dog just loves em"
452931,crappieperchhunter,2010-04-07 04:29:00,2582, I agree with that statement 100%.
452932,crappieperchhunter,2010-04-07 04:33:00,2582, Seems I remember him trying to chow down on Cliff's smelt when we where down this winter with you Bruce  Don't you feed the poor little guy
452936,Stern Rules,2010-04-07 04:41:00,342,Gills and crappies are very tasty. I tried pumpkinseeds for the first time last year and they're not bad either. All are good. My preference is the crappies.
452946,Afraz,2010-04-07 06:08:00,250,"Pound for pound (if you manage to land a 1 lber lol) i would take a sunfish/bluegill over a crappie any day. Better den crappies but not as good as perch, WORD !!!"
452968,bigugli,2010-04-07 12:03:00,6138,What would you rather eat? Kibble or fish. The dog is no dummy
452986,steverowbotham,2010-04-07 12:55:00,1800,"I love a good beer battered bluegill.  I agree that bluegill/pumpkinseed are better than crappie.  Its a nice sweet meat, especially out of cold water."
452990,Beans,2010-04-07 13:06:00,3339,It's too bad that McDonalds can't use bluegill/sunfish in their Fillet O' Fish sandwich...  A breaded bluegill/sunfish fillet is just the right size for a hamburger bun...some lettuce and Heinz tarter sauce...YYYUUUMMMM
453049,OhioFisherman,2010-04-07 15:08:00,6623,"Yep, great to eat, finding ones of any size can be a problem, they are out there though. I didn`t mess with them unless they were 8 inches or more either. A friend had a pond that they grew big in, 10 inches or more. On light tackle they can be fun to catch."
453050,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-07 15:11:00,2690,"Okay, now you guys are making my stomach growl!!!!"
453056,skeeter,2010-04-07 15:46:00,1907, Thats an interesting concept. McDonalds selling some thing with REAL meat/fish in it.
453067,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-07 15:56:00,2690,"Too bad more people don't keep them and release their sportfish...they are called panfish for a reason.  Like Steve said out of cold water, delicious...same goes for rock bass (believe it or not)!!"
453104,Beans,2010-04-07 17:17:00,3339,"  I saw a feature on TV that showed that McD uses some kind of Australian ""trash"" fish in their Fillet O' Fish...had a face on it like a mackeral...Go figure !!!"
453109,Ron,2010-04-07 17:32:00,1683,"Gills and Pumkinseeds are awesome! Too bad some tourists operators think Canadians consider them to be garbage fish. They could use the extra business if they promoted it wisely.  We have been getting some decent gills in the shallows right now. Don't bother downsizing your baits either, the small guys can't seem to get the hooks in their mouths.  Also remember, if you are fishing the Kawarthas, the new regs show you can only keep a limit of 30 Crappie, 50 Perch and an astounding amount of Sunfish. 300 Sunfish, with only 30 of them over 7.1 inches."
453116,bigugli,2010-04-07 17:48:00,6138,Even better if wrapped in baacon and melted cheese
453140,dsn,2010-04-07 19:04:00,1018,Just watch out the yellow grubs in them. The seem to be the most popular fish with yellow grub problems from my experience.  yuck hate those pillsbury boy grubs !! They crawl after you dug them out of the flesh of the fish.    dsn
453154,Mykester,2010-04-07 19:48:00,241," At Algonquin we'd always catch about 20 rock bass pushing 9 inches, and a good amount of smaller ones thrown back. Good eating."
453159,Governator,2010-04-07 19:56:00,879,"  I've thankfully never come across those, what is it exactly?  Mind you I've never bothered fileting a sunfish just perch."
453190,ciscokid,2010-04-07 21:05:00,52,"I like them and will occasionally keep a bunch if im not catching anything else. Plus id imagine its better for the fishery to take out a mix rather than focus on just perch or something, kind of evens things out. Just a thought"
453514,Spiel,2010-04-08 13:38:00,9065,"  Yellow grub are very common in perch, in fact I've seen them in just about every species of fish I've cleaned over the years. Chances are you've eaten them.  http://www.michigan....26966--,00.html"
453535,Governator,2010-04-08 14:34:00,879,"  I've only been fishing a few years, sounds disgusting lol.  I've caught them with black spots out of bass lake in orillia.  That was pretty disturbing."
