I find I am needing the larger font more now. It's easy to deal with, ctrl+ changes it easy. Not that I have a problem with the larger font,and the topics in a light blue. When I clicked on a topic and went back, the topics I did click on were in black, so I knew I had read them or responded to them.  A couple of hours ago, it all changed, all topics are in a much smaller font, and all are black, even the clicked on topics, and I have not changed any settings whatsoever.  Any ideers?????????  I liked the topics in a light blue colour(or whatever colour), and the ones I have read in black. Font size I can deal with."

Well, Rick fixed something, just not to my liking is all,    Easy fix, press and hold the ctrl key on the bottom left of your keyboard, and hit the + key on right hand side or upper right of your keyboard. It instantly increases the font size, do it a couple times or more for your liking. You can also press the ctrl & - keys to decrease the font size."
