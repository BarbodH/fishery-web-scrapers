453572,superdad,2010-04-08 16:23:00,353,"Laker John and I went to Hay Bay this morrning hopeful to remove a wheel from the dock, but the rust had an upper hand  and we have decided on Plan B, remove the tire and install a better tire and a tube.  The water level in Hay Bay is attrociously LOW!!!!!!!!!!!! At least two feet short of the 'normal' spring level.  Stopped by the Shermans Launch ramp and the dock has not been put in the water, in fact we can't see the dock at all, they used to store it beside the building.  Headed into Napanee to have a look at the water below the falls at SpringSide Park. There is a LOT of construction on-going, they have replaced much of the rock baskets with really big rocks and they are widening the walkway.  Looking into the water, we could see a ton of Red Horse Suckers that appeared to be spawning. They were banging and crashing in the shallows behind rocks. We walked along the wall towards the falls and the backwashes. Finally Laker said have a look here and sure enough there was a pair of walleye behind a big rock close to shore. The white tipped tail was a dead give away.  So we can assume that walleyes are getting ready for the spawn, we didn't have thermometer to get the water temp....  By the way - RiverSide Fries at SpringSide park are making some VERY TASTY French Fries - FYI.  Stay Tuned  David  aka  Superdad"
