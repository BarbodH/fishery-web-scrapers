453404,rigger,2010-04-08 03:53:00,8,Never thought to take pics of smelts here.  My arm is still sore cleaning them a few nights ago.  There is alot more smelt this year than many years I have seen but still not the same as in the late 60's when a 6x6 smelt net would break bringing up one load of smelt and you could load one bushel basket full with one catch.  The smelt are a younger class this year with only a few of the mature older ones.  I just can't wait until next year so I will only have to clean 60 or so for some good frozen meals.  Take care....Rob!
