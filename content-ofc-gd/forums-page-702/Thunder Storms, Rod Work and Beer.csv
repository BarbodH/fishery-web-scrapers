453053,Spiel,2010-04-07 15:30:00,9065,"Well it's absolutely pissing down rain here in Hamilton, lots of thunder and lightening, the dog has gone into hiding.  I have a couple of rods I was hoping to apply the winding finish on but it'll have to wait. The possibility of having the power go out while the rod is in the drying lathe is never a good thing, this I know from experience!  The good thing is we need the rain and I have beer so things aren't all bad.  Oh and of course I have OFC as long as the power don't go out."
453057,Joey,2010-04-07 15:47:00,9122,Life is good eh  Rods and lightening never really go together well do they  Have one for me dear
453058,MJL,2010-04-07 15:48:00,2427,Acentone can take finish off a messed up rod AND a kitchen table…Thank God for table coasters and vases  Show us some custom rod porn already!
453059,skeeter,2010-04-07 15:49:00,1907,"oh come on spiel. you have beer, so you can spin the rod by hand if the power goes out."
453073,Spiel,2010-04-07 16:05:00,9065," Just one....    LOL....I prefer not to create extra work Mike.  As for the rod porn, well I'll have to dig out the camera.     Sure I could but the rod lathe is too far from the beer fridge and I need to stay near it in case the power goes out. Wouldn't want my beer to get warm.  "
453078,highdrifter,2010-04-07 16:16:00,2534,"You sir are a tease!!  Even more so than these scantily clad cali babes doing yoga at my doorstep..  I could get a camera, but then...  I'd have to dig it out!  MUAHAHAH!"
453080,Spiel,2010-04-07 16:20:00,9065,"  For goodness sakes Fidel, let 'em in, I'll bring the beer.  "
453081,solopaddler,2010-04-07 16:22:00,8605,If it was my rod I'm glad you decided to take a break.  It's a wild day isn't it? Warm and breezy with thunder rumbling. Almost like June instead of early April.
453085,Spiel,2010-04-07 16:25:00,9065," Yep, one of them is your rod Mike, maybe tomorrow.   "
453086,GBW,2010-04-07 16:27:00,8460,you had me at beer...
453088,Harrison,2010-04-07 16:28:00,2202,"Ahh, title brings back some good memories of my early years.  Go ahead and turn the rod Chris, I've seen your work and would pay for a defect no worries!"
453090,highdrifter,2010-04-07 16:41:00,2534," Don't suppose you have a warp machine do ya??  I'm in Del Mar Beach, CA right now...  pondering whether or not to buy a surf rod and harass the surfers!!  Show us some macros and just maybe, I'll return the favor eh!"
453096,Spiel,2010-04-07 16:49:00,9065,"Okay, here's a couple of shots of a casting rod I'm doing for Solopaddler, he picked up a spinning rod a week or so back which is the twin to this one.    "
453117,solopaddler,2010-04-07 17:51:00,8605,"Sweet, she's goona be a nice stick.  In case anyone's wondering and I'm sure Spiel will agree, these Rainshadow XST blanks are unreal.  Right on par with the most expensive Loomis blanks for lightness and sensitivity."
453122,Spiel,2010-04-07 18:11:00,9065,"  They certainly feel nice and look nice Mike. I must say I really like the Carbon Pearl finish, my pics unfortunately don't capture their true beauty."
453123,MJL,2010-04-07 18:14:00,2427," I can come by with my DSLR and take some better pics for you...Mind you, the best light to use is natural sun-light...Especially outside...At the river..."
453124,Spiel,2010-04-07 18:18:00,9065," My door is open to you any time Mike, but you're right, we should do this by the river, any river.   "
453125,John,2010-04-07 18:20:00,2956,Are the Rainshadow blanks yours Chris or did Mike supply them?
453126,Spiel,2010-04-07 18:21:00,9065,  Mike supplied them John.  
453129,John,2010-04-07 18:26:00,2956, OK thanks Chris I will talk to him...
453130,John,2010-04-07 18:28:00,2956," Hi Mike,  Do you have a source for those blanks that you can share? e-mail me if you like, [email protected]"
453131,Spiel,2010-04-07 18:28:00,9065,"Oooops, my bad. The Rainshadow RX8 blanks are satin black, the carbon pearl is the St Croix III blank I have next up on the build desk for Roy."
453133,solopaddler,2010-04-07 18:36:00,8605,"Actually the XST blanks are called ""titanium chrome"" by Batson. They're gorgeous blanks.  John check your pm's."
453135,Spiel,2010-04-07 18:47:00,9065," I guess your right Mike, I was going by their RX8 blank line up on their website which I now see are also offered in ""titanium chrome"", it's beauty for sure.  http://www.batsonent...=122&Itemid=101   It is very similar to the St Croix III Carbon Pearl."
453204,highdrifter,2010-04-07 22:11:00,2534, OOHH that blank would match up purrfect with my Antares..  mmmhhmmmm!!
