Anybody fish the inner bay for pike...didn't realise it had an all year season (not that I really want to keep any, but, the opportunity to fish for them is there). Asked the same question on the Long Point forum and got some great tips from Jimmy of Rotten Ronnies, just wondering if any OFNers give it a shot. Figured it might be a good spot to try the boat out for the first time this spring...if the pike fishing is off always have perch as an option"
