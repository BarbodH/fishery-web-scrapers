452402,hawk-eye,2010-04-06 02:19:00,141,"Love it - Ive got it on a lot of my rods, Spooled one up with 10 lb for drifting the niagra 3 years ago and I havent had to respool it yet, I run 20 lb on my carp setup, 50 lb on a flippin stick and a 8 foot baitcaster i use for casting for pike and muskie, 4 rods spooled with 30 lb for trollin dipsy divers in the big lakes, and 2 with 100 lb for trollin muskie.  I love the stuff and would not change anytime soon."
452407,bassman87,2010-04-06 02:25:00,586,seriously you guys should try the suffix braid and you'll cringe at the thought of using powerpro again

Tie a palomar knot if you are tying a swivel, or a uni knot if you are tying directly to a lure.  KNots. I don't understand the line fail way down the spool, tho."

452496,canadadude,2010-04-06 11:29:00,769,"Hey Mike I bought 2 150yd spools of 2-10 Power Pro for $10.00 the day I saw you at Port D, Maybe I can hook you up next time your down there. The stuff I got this time is red, but it seems to work the same as green.  Another trick on the lighter braids, especially in cold weather is spray the line with leather protectant or silicone spray this brings it back to original condition. Braids when new have a coating which wears off after prolonged use,when given a spray of protectant every few trips the line casts farther and also reduces Icing in the winter."
452501,Sinker,2010-04-06 11:47:00,8692,"I've never broken power pro unless I cut it myself. I use it for just about everything nowadays too. From 15/4 up to 100lb test. Sounds like you got a bad batch, or your guides are messed up.  S."
452513,JPD,2010-04-06 12:36:00,296,"If your line keeps breaking by the reel, odds are good that you have a burr or a gap in your roller bearing. If the line was bad it would break in various places, not consistently at or near the reel.  JP"

Can`t help ya with your line problem cause I have been using good ole mono for 40 plus years,tried some braid because everybody said it was so great personally I can`t see what all the fuss is about."
452546,charlesn,2010-04-06 13:42:00,551,"Even with taking the possibility of it being ""fake"" Power Pro out of the equation, any type of line can have a bad spool.  As you can see some swear by it (they haven't got a bad spool yet) and some hate it (got one).  I've tried all the brands mentioned here and now I get ""whatever is on sale"".  I have had good experience with all the brands PP, Stren Superbraid, Spiderwire, Spiderthread, Suffix, Tuf-line.  Maybe I'm just lucky but in probably 50 spools worth of usage, I've never experienced (yet) what you speak of.  Once down in Texas a friend had cut my line when I wasn't there and then reeled back over the cut.  I cast out as usual and had the world's biggest backlash and lost my lure and he laughed til he nearly peed his pants.  I laughed too.  Maybe you're being sabotaged?  j/k"

Also been using Fireline for many years at smaller diameters for panfish, walleye, pike, trout, bass, etc. Never a problem, except for a couple of birds' nests, but that was my fault. My casts with Fireline are easily twice the distance of similar mono line."
452594,Blake,2010-04-06 15:18:00,418,I have used Power Pro for over 7 years and it has been great. I have never had any issues with any size of test.  There was an issue 4 years ago of some fake Power Pro coming in from China but was easily spotted by retailers with the information provided by Power pro.  I have 90% of all my reels using Power Pro.  Check your reel guide or rod for nicks.  I know when I am out on the water fun fishing or tournament fishing that I am confident in my Power Pro line to feel every bite and land all my fish.

452619,John,2010-04-06 16:19:00,2956,I am liking JP's thoughts on the roller on the bail arm. I used to have similar problems with mono depending on the reel quality and construction. It used to get wedged down in the side of the roller and one cast would do it....... twang! I think that if you are using 4# equivalent PP then the small diameter just might get down in there on some reels....
452639,diggyj,2010-04-06 17:09:00,548,"Never had any issues with PP. Works great and I'm sticking with it, although I want to give Spider Thread a try this year! I hear good things about it!  Dirk"
452678,houski,2010-04-06 18:39:00,61,"Hey guys,  Just my two cents here...  I switched my Muskie line from 80lb Dacron to 80lb Power Pro back around the time it first came out. I had multiple problems with it breaking mid cast, and on sudden hooksets, and other sudden stopages lost more than my fair share of baits, and fish with this line. Now I gave it a chance, but after buying/returning 4 or 5 spools of it, I would never reccomend it to anyone.  I ran through all the troubleshooting (eg. checking my rod guides, visually inspecting the line for frays, nicks, or any discolouration, etc.) However, I haven't used it in years, so, I'm not sure if they've improved thier line or not.  I will say though, that from my personal experience, Power Pro was very strong if you were applying even tension to the line, (eg. pulling in large sticks, attempting to bend hooks out on snags, etc.) but where I think it really fails as a line is where the line is suddenly stopped, and a great amount of force is applyed quickly, as in setting the hook on a large fish."
452725,Garry2Rs,2010-04-06 20:42:00,1425,"I have had old power pro, where the colour was washed out, start breaking like that.  These lines had been used in very dirty water down south.  Since the Spectra fibers are so tiny, I wondered if the silt might be getting into the braid and weakening it over a long period of time???"
452735,lew,2010-04-06 21:15:00,12766,Been using Power Pro on all my musky rods for probably 7 or 8 years now and never had a problem with it.  It's good stuff in my books.
452849,Mike Pike,2010-04-07 00:33:00,1332,"Thanks again for the suggestions folks.  I just inspected the roller on my the bail arm for a gap and all looks fine.  Noticed what looks like some wear on the one end of the roller, though.  Hmmmmm.  I'm wondering if the braid does this over time?  It's a Rapala reel with a brassy looking roller but it's darker and 'appears' rougher towards the one end where I believe it may be worn( Best as I can tell with my glasses on and usng a magnifying glass as well! ).  So, I'm gonna switch to a newer reel and since I have one last spool of Power Pro, I gonna give it one more try.  I'm also gonna get my buddy, who was having similar problems, to inspect his rod guides and reel as well.  Good fishing y'all!"

452149,Mike Pike,2010-04-05 18:40:00,1332,"Ok, so I've been using Power Pro braid( 15 - 4 )when drifting in the Niagara area and when I get snagged up and tug on the line, the braid just breaks.  It's happened several times now.  It just snaps about a foot or two from the reel.  Odd because you'd think my 6lb floro leader would break first or my 6lb dropper line, but no.  The braid breaks, and with minimal pull.  A friend of mine complained to me about Power Pro too, and said he had his break when casting pike spoons on Georgian Bay right near the spoon itself.  He's getting frustrated loosing lures and says he won't buy it anymore.  Just wondering if anyone had a clue as to what the problem is and if you've had silmilar experience with the stuff.  Thanks."
452151,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-05 18:44:00,0,Chech the eyes on the rod yer usin. Sounds like one might have a crack in it and making your line snap
452153,bassman87,2010-04-05 18:46:00,586,switch to suffix braid you wont be disappointed
452156,CLofchik,2010-04-05 18:52:00,854,"PP, and Spectra braids in general, main (only?) weakness is they are very prone to abrasion compared to mono or flouro.  One nick and you loose half your strength.  Essentially they are a cable, and once you cut one strand it starts to unwind rather quick.  Anytime I'm drifting or bumping bottom I use a long tippet of mono or flouro and don't have any problems except getting my knot small enough to slip through the guides (Albright's Knot)."
452157,Syn,2010-04-05 18:53:00,519,"One theory I was reading about was constant pulling weakens the line and using a weaker leader to save your braid would make it last longer. I will find the link. brb.  edit: here http://www.striperso...ad.php?t=497830   Also maybe you have a defective batch, I would take it back and get it exchanged.  more edit: I've had pretty good luck with the power pro. Broke only once on me in 2 years. But I heard it is made with 4 strands and I will be trying 6 stranded braid like Sufix Performance Braid this year for pike fishing."
452158,Mike Pike,2010-04-05 18:53:00,1332,"I'll check the guides with a q-tip, GBFisher, to see if I have a problem there.  It's a new rod and I've been careful with it, but ya never know til you check, right.  Failing that, maybe try the Suffix riverfisher22 suggests."
452159,ciscokid,2010-04-05 18:55:00,52,I ve never used power pro and after reading this i can safely say i will never use power pro.
452165,uglyfish,2010-04-05 19:09:00,981,"power pro just sucks. plain and simple. used it before, and same thing, very weak line, breaks off easy, and even breaks off when tossing some baits out. and i used 30-50lb. after that, line was stripped off the reel, and tossed, never will use it again. it doesnt sit well on the reel, doesnt cast as good, and the power in it sucks... oh, and i didnt like my hands turning green after using it one.  i only got it cause the store had a sale on bulk line spooling. i normally would use spiderwire stealth. after that fiasco, i went back to spiderwire and thats all."
452167,MJL,2010-04-05 19:25:00,2427,"I use 65lb PowerPro for my ‘extreme’ carp fishing when zebra mussels are involved.  I do find lighter breaking strains just don’t have the same abrasion resistance for zebra mussels.  Everywhere else, I found PowerPro (15-20lb) very reliable and handled snags great (often times I pull snags to shore with it) – Still have PowerPro spooled on my reels since 2001.  It sounds like you may have a cracked guide or simply a bad batch of line – Possibly a counterfit spool from China which made their rounds a couple years ago?"
452169,torco,2010-04-05 19:32:00,656,I use powerpro for chucking spoons off piers for salmon and have so far been impressed. I actually thought it took a pretty good beating and never broke. I think I was using it 10lbs test (diamter).  Its weird that it breaks near the reel for you. I would check that something is not damaging it on the reel or like others said the rod guides.

452182,John,2010-04-05 19:57:00,2956,"Personally I love the stuff, but only in the larger diameters. I have had 80# PP on my musky reels now for 3 seasons and except for the colour it performs the same. I tried lighter 15# on my spinning reels and hated it, but it did not break on me..  I am also thinking that you may have a guide problem. The other thought was do you wear a ring that could be fraying it?"

452261,tjsa,2010-04-05 23:04:00,1578,"I only use it on my walleye trolling rods, not for casting. You do have to watch it, it will get in behind the bail roller if you are using a spinning reel because of its smaller diameter. Never had a problem with it in over 6 yrs. I use a section of wooden hockey stick to wrap it around to break it loose from a snag if that happens. Darn near put the gunwales of the boat or canoe underwater doing it though."

Now this season I bought some 50lb PP and I'm using it on my jig rod...casted some pike jerkbaits with it feeling rock bottom on the entire retrieve with not one nick or cut in the line. Seemed to do well in that situation fishing.
452364,Mike Pike,2010-04-06 01:36:00,1332,"Just wanted to say a quick 'thanks' for all of ya who took the time to answer.  So, I put my glasses on, took a q-tip and inspected the rod guides and all look nice and smooth with no nicks.  The spool and reel seem to check out ok too.  I'm wondering if chucking those heavy sinkers repeatedly with full force( Niagara River shore anglers will know what I mean )adds some kind of extra stress to braid???  Anyhoo, I'm gonna start using one of my other reels( incase it's a reel issue that I wasn't able to see )and if it happens again I'll switch to another line.  Spiderwire or Suffix, as was suggested, will be on my list.  I pay anywhere from 20 to 25 bucks a spool for the Power Pro, and when I cast a mile out and it breaks close to the reel, I end up loosing a lot of line.  Just looking for the most reliable bang for my buck.  Thanks again."
452389,MJL,2010-04-06 02:04:00,2427," Yes it can.  Surf fishermen and carp anglers casting at long range often use shock leaders to minimize the probability of cracking off.  It’s not about fatiguing the line with repeated casts that causes the line to break (though theoretically it can), it’s the single sudden shock experienced on the line at that one single moment during the cast.  Shock leaders are a length of heavy mono or super strong braid spliced onto the end of the mainline to take the force of the cast (often 30-45lb for 3-4oz weights).  I use them for my long range carp fishing at 100+ yards - I use the specialty tapered shock leaders though which taper from 45lb to 10lb (when using 30lb PowerPro or 10lb mono for a mainline).  I find punching too early during the cast or not smoothly accelerating during the casting stroke can cause crack offs no matter the line you're using."
