452916,Stoty,2010-04-07 03:13:00,2910,"Well, with the beautiful weather last week, it was the perfect time to get the Ranger out of storage and get out and get some fishing hours on the newly open year-round Kawartha's!  It was also a great time to get out with some buddies and do some fun fishing.  Man oh man, the first two trips of 2010's softwater season didn't disappoint!  We hit over 300 fish per day! Literally every cast! It was insane. By far the best Crappie fishing I've ever experienced.  90% of the fish were caught on the brand new LUNKERHUNT panfish baits, that are being released later this year. Hot colours seemed to be pink and red (see the picture below).  Lots of little ones (5-8 inches), but also lots of great eaters (8"" plus). Our biggest was 16"" and weighing it at 2.1 lbs!!  Here are some pictures:        "

452921,Syn,2010-04-07 03:26:00,519,"oh man, now I'm officially jealous.  Congrats on your crappie haul!   So many great threads lately of people having a great day fishing. I'm double checking the regs in my area for crappies. I know where there is a ton of them not far from my home."
452925,Stoty,2010-04-07 03:32:00,2910, The big one is in the first picture......
452934,crappieperchhunter,2010-04-07 04:39:00,2582,Well done. I'm loving this early crappie action. I see your using the lunker city jigheads with your new deadly bait. If there is a better quality jig head out there in 1/32 and 1/16 ounce size I haven't found it.
452959,Stoty,2010-04-07 11:33:00,2910," Agreed, they are wicked little jig heads! Super sharp too! I learned the hard way a few times, lol."
452961,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-07 11:43:00,2690,"Awesome crappies Jamie!!!!!  Was talking to John (Purpleghost), guess they were killing them as well."
452980,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-07 12:31:00,655,Very nice crappies WTG!
452985,steverowbotham,2010-04-07 12:53:00,1800,nice!
453013,muskeybugged,2010-04-07 14:05:00,282,You could almost fit your hand in that ones mouth.  Good job.
453185,solopaddler,2010-04-07 20:47:00,8605,Fantastic. I'm thinking I might trailer the boat up for the day with the kids. Great stuff.
453210,EC1,2010-04-07 22:22:00,930,That bait looks mighty fine! Is it going to be an expensive one? Nice fish btw!  I've been waiting for a while to use my lunker city heads again! Can't wait to use them once again tonight! (The fish earlier in the year wouldnt take jigs with such a big hook).
453215,thebigcatch,2010-04-07 23:08:00,138,looks like a good time guy nice lookin fish...... it time nest week to gt the nitro out and have some fun
453256,Stoty,2010-04-08 00:40:00,2910,Thanks guys!   I'm not too sure what they will come out at but The LUNKERHUNT baits are very reasonably priced. The typical price range for soft plastics.
