453505,myot,2010-04-08 13:17:00,131,My brother is looking at buying a stratos 1760dv but there is no dealer in ontario that has one is stock He would like to look at one before he opens up his wallet I was just wondering if any OFC members own a 17' Walleye/Multi species boat and would mind giving him a tour the boat does not have to be that exact same model.  Thanks Dan
