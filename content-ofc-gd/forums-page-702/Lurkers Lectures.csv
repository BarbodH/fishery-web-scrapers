453463,MJL,2010-04-08 08:40:00,2427," What’s your point?  Jim Butler has never seen me with anything other than a 7ft spinning rod on our local rivers tossing spinners. Henry Lee from Cobourg hasn’t seen me use a float combo since I was a teen opting to use his custom wooden plugs or flutter spoons instead in the trench.  They spend tons more time on the rivers than either you or I (Though last spring and fall I was out 4-6 times a week before work, after work, nights and weekends – Fishing was too good to pass up)  I’m certainly not limited to just using spinning reels when it gets windy…That’s my point.  I can use a spinning reel pretty much everywhere I use a centrepin plus more (at least in terms of efficiency for bottom bouncing and lure chucking).  If you re-read my original post, I mentioned that for sheer versatility, the spinning reel is the way to go.  As far as teaching newbies to use a pin on the river and answering questions for people who post them on a forum; they’re the ones asking for help. Centrepins are a sexy topic on the net…More people talk about them for steelhead on this board – Basic statistics.  The more people who ask about which centrepins and float rods to get, the more I will reply to them with my own opinions…If someone’s asking about what spinning reel to get for steelhead, I tell them what spinning reel I recommend. I’m certainly not the one telling them they need to get a pin to catch more steelhead  From what I gather, the last few posts of yours revolves on trying to prove the hypocrisy amongst anglers who use centrepins VS not using spinning reels…We get it…I prefer to use a centrepin for float fishing because of its efficiency and  fun factor (As I stated in my 2nd post – I’m sure others feel the same way).  It certainly doesn’t mean I’m a slave to the pin when I want to catch a lot of fish. I’ve always felt it was the angler who catches the fish, not the tackle.  Tackle only enhances the skills and knowledge an angler already possess.  Great anglers IMO are flexible, adaptive and receptive to new ideas regardless of the tackle they use.  It’s obvious that your perspectives on float fishing are based on a limited knowledge base and experience.  You have no idea what you’re missing out on.  With that said, you can pick away at various small points of my posts and selectively ignore or fail to consider others as you have done…From my own perspective, a lot of your arguments or points either directed at me or other board members lack substance related to the topic.  That’s all I really have to say about that.  You’re an angler who’s obviously passionate about the sport and I respect that…I, like a bunch of other people feel like you’re coming off as arrogant, ignorant and unwilling to accept new ideas  As far as the net goes…That one’s Victors…He felt more comfortable using a net than tailing it (or at least trying to multiple times).  I’ve never harvested a steelhead in the 20yrs I’ve fished for them. I don’t believe in killing fish just for roe or keeping for the sake of keeping…But that’s just me."

You must be one of the guys that always shows up at the top of the hole when five guys are already there casting spinners and thinks he has the right of way to drift down 200 yards...  By the way I along with many other fisherman would take bottom bouncing over ""pinning"" on the Notty anyday. I guess unless i had to line up shoulder to shoulder with all the other yahoos down at the beach and get in the ""drift""..."

453415,rigger,2010-04-08 04:16:00,8,"Float reel:  Instant hook-ups and longer, smoother slow drifts.  Alot more line at your disposal and almost never a reel failure.  Spinning reel:  You can cast farther upstream all day long, fish 14 hrs/day and 7 days/week with no arm fatigue and loose less fish with a good drag.  Guides:  Try not fish on weekends when most of their clients book and hope when you run into them that their clients have experience, etiquette, commensense and the wrong bait.  Rob!"
453416,StoneFly,2010-04-08 04:21:00,574," Just to clarify are you saying that you can drift down 100-200' and keep your line as tight with a nice presentation with a spinning reel as with a centerpin?  also are you saying that spilt second you have to lock down and keep a fish out of the wood work is as effective with a spinning as it is with a centrepin?  if so,..(which I dont beleive for a second)...and you have this skill...why do you own a centrepin...would seem redundant...and a waste of money for the truelly skilled anglers....your words seem to suggest only the middle of the road guys would use it...but spinners are gfood for newbies and the well skilled guys.  please clarify"

I agree on casting...no doubt there.  your argument about elitest is also B*...recall i used to use a spinning set-up...do you think I changed becasue I think its cool?  LMAO...give your head a shake!!!  as far as reeling in...i can rell a 5"" reel in faster than a soinning reel,..im not sure who couldnt.   the only time a spinning reel for a float set up even come close is in the ditches....but landing the fish has less success,..and the topic of FUN hasnt even been introdcued,...isnt that what its all about...?"
453425,troutologist,2010-04-08 04:50:00,951,"Stonefly,  you're very obviously the goof wearing Patagucci with a matching centerpin. Time and again here you have proved ignorance and lack luster intelligence by tossing out some insults and misinformation.  If you can't comprehend the fact that your Lake O ditches are vastly different than the Superior tribs you are dense.  Bottom bouncing is a proven and very effective technique up where we alls are imbreds.  It doesn't equate ubiquitously to flossing as you seem to gather. To learn to catch fish and save tackle in northern tribs or the rapids, you have to have some skill. Its how all of the people I know learned...though once the horseless carriages made it possible to ship float reels into Northern Ontario (past Barrie for you) a growing number of people are trying because it is a new challenge.  I like to think of being a steelheader as opposed to a centerpinner (though I use one alot), Im out there to catch fish on whatever it takes, not just to look the part."
453426,Cudz,2010-04-08 04:55:00,2652,"Wow, this thread took a turn for the worse. Got a wee bit heated up.   I am a brutal steelhead fisherman but I am always up for a good ruck. I don't have a centerpin reel but I have used one.  I wasn't very good with it and because I rarely fish for steelies, it wouldn't be my choice of reel.  I am sure once you get the hang of them they work better for most situations but for the average Joe like me to drop $200 (at least) on a reel that I would use 3 times a year seems senseless.  I don't think 95% of guys are using pins but maybe that is just on the rivers I have fished.  I would say about 10% use pins on the Notty but I may be wrong. I am useless at drifting and I bottom bounce but never ever floss fish.  I think the satement about all bottom bouncer fishermen are flossing fish, is not true for the majority of people.  Stonefly, I do like your passion for centerpins and I think you're probably a great fisherman but for me a spinning reel or casting reel would be a better choice.  For you and Solo a pin makes sense and for most situations they probably work better.  PS.  If this turns violent, count me in.  Don't know which side I will be on but I will be in it.  LOL!"

If I were you I wouldn't buy a pin either,..you need to be avid river fisherman to make the learning curve worthwhile....I really dont know where the notion of Centre pin guys use it for any other reason than it is more effective came about and I dont really care...I think the only guys that disagree are the ones that didnt have the patience to use it effectively....or just dont get it.  I am the last guy that would use something becasue I thought it made me cool...geeez im on the river with a rod with a broken tip...and a jacket with gluestains all over it because i used it for construction on rooftops...and my sweater ,..the blue one..is 15 years old, the zipper doesnt work and its got perminant burrs lodged in it...oh also I have the cheapest chest pack money can buy...but inside is gold....if that is elitest,..i dont even know what I would call some of the other guys wearing $3000 worth of gear.  cuz it aint me.  To your last 2 points...You probably dont know you are flossing...but alot of guys do...and as for the centrepin working better for some guys,..its only because they took the time and effort to learn...and now understand how much better it is than a spinining reel for drifting...regarding the notty...I disagree bigtime...closer to 80% or more use pins... but then again its more of the catch and release guys.  And to the last one...I had a very frustrating workday today and was punching walls and steel doors anytime i wasnt around co-workers....kinda wished I was on the river close to some big mouths that were here yapping a bunch of Bull!!! lol...not directed at you Cudz....but some of the name callin guys...GIDDY UP!!!!"

I can relate to having bad days at work.  Wait a second, no I can't, I am a phys ed teacher.  Anyway, I know how it can feel after having a bad day and then feeling like everyone is on your case about something you believe strongly in. Writing on the internet can often come across differently than you plan it to.  Often, the readers will put their own tone on a post that is not the same tone as you had written.  Sarcasm is a good example of something that doesn't work well on the internet or in text messages.  Anyway Stonefly, I think you are a good fisherman and I think you have some good insight and info that would prove valuable to many anglers here.  I don't want to see you get banned or have you stop posting over something as small as an opinion about suitable river gear.  Hope you take that into consideration and make some little changes to a few post before sunrise.  That would be cool."
453444,vinnimon,2010-04-08 05:50:00,2593,"Just for a joke Im bringen the red and whites down for some float fishing in the am. I recall an old gent criticizing me over my gear.What he said was""what do you need that fir, are ya tryin to intice he lady fish with the fancy what nots, this what you need boy"". On that note as I remember I do the same on occasions.No more than 5 bucks for a set and bait. And he out fished me. This rig up caught me a monster pike and a few trout."
453445,MJL,2010-04-08 05:57:00,2427," I can do both: go to total lock down in an instant and do long drifts…Not sure if you have the skill yet to do it though  I never suggested that only newbies and pros can use spinning reels...Quite the opposite...Given practice and ingenuity, anyone can achieve the same results.  On top of that, you also have the versatility to switch up to lure chucking or bottom bouncing.  For long drifts with the spinning reel, I usually have an open bail and feather the line as it comes off the spool to control the speed at which line flows off the reel – You can also control speed at which line goes off the spool by varying the distance at which your finger is away from the lip of the spool…I almost always cast directly across from me or slightly downstream.  In faster flows I sometimes cast a few feet upstream to ensure my bait is close to bottom throughout most of the drift (but never enough to not be in contact with the float). Manipulate the angle of your rod to control slack and lightly mend if required (similar to trotting a float with a pin)...Continue on with the drift for however far you want to fish.  The limper the line, the easier it is to do (6-8lb Silver Thread is my favourite).  As with centrepins the longer the rod, the easier it is to do.  Should a fish take the bait, trap the line against the spool with your index finger and set the hook (At least that’s how I do it) – Close the bail and proceed to fight the fish.  You may question “don’t you lose fish when you gotta go through all those steps especially when you have to close the bail?”  I personally don’t…Usually when you hook a fish, they usually headshake for a bit which gives you enough time to close the bail and reel in whatever minimal slack there may be.  The 6.1 ratio on my Stradic makes it easy (Especially with a 4000 size reel).  One other method which I’ve seen was with BBNotty’s son.  He manipulated his drift by opening and closing the bait to create a seamless drag free drift – He also controls slack on the water by adjusting the angle of his rod and casts across or only very slightly upstream to make sure his offering is down near bottom throughout the drift.    The day I fished with him, he actually did end of catching 95% of the fish out of all the anglers that day which were almost all pinners.LOL  There are a few different ways to get a good long distance drag free float.  Pick one that you’re comfortable with and practice.  Why do I use a float reel? - It’s fun to use and more efficient than a spinning reel - My first ever centrepin (a 3.75"" Hardy Silex replica) was given to me for free as a kid by my early steelheading mentors who were English (and also machinists).  They made it for me and taught me how to use it at no charge - My $800 custom AngSpec was also free (Why not use it?)  Why don’t I use a spinning reel for float fishing 100% of the time? - As I said, a float reel is fun to use and efficient - I do use a spinning reel when it’s blowing more than 25 clicks - I do use a spinning reel off the pier for chucking spoons  - I do use a spinning reel to bottom bounce.  Usually use either a 9-11ft Med-light or med action rod for fast water or an old 10'6"" noodle rod in slower or shallower water as seen in the background of this picture)...Sometimes fish spook from the sight of even clear floats...Gotta adapt.   - I do use a spinning reel to toss spinners (Usually with a 7ft Shimano Compre spinning rod as seen in this picture)   - From time to time, I still do take a spinning reel out to float fish with if there's only enough room for 1 reel in my bag (I was a poor university student at one time who had to take the bus everywhere - 2000 Stradic matched with an old 13' Loomis...float fish, bottom bounced and spinner fished with it depending on what stretch of river I happened to be fishing as well as the conditions)    My 2000 and 4000 Shimano stradics get a good work out during the season.  I like variety so I also fly fish and swing large streamers for steel but I guess that wasn't part of the question...   As an aside  Why don't I use a spinning reel + 13ft rod 100% of the time? I wouldn't mind getting stuck using a spinning reel...A 13ft rod however might be a great choice for float fishing, it isn't always the best tool for the job for other steelheading disciplines(In case you may be wondering)...For my fishing, I worry more about the action and physical abilities of the rod I'm using than the reel...But that's just me...Anyone who fishes with me knows I use whatever tactics work the best for the conditions given...And No float fishing isn't always the best.  In my opinion, learning a variety of different skills makes you a better angler...Of course that's just my opinion."

I do happen to enjoy fishing with a long light rod and a centrepin reel, that's obvious.  Many times it's deadly because of the presentation. In many instances it's not and another tactic is superior.  If you can't grasp that simple fact, and it's clear that you don't, you really do have a lot to learn.  While you have zero problems imposing your odd thoughts on others it seems you get a bit touchy when someone contradicts you.  "

453399,rigger,2010-04-08 03:44:00,8,"Been fishing for trout for almost 40 yrs here and 35 years float fishing with a float you had to buy made from balsa wood in the States.  There are different drifts with my Tournament Drifter float reel setup, you just cannot fish proficiantly.  I still try to bring 3 rods with me to fish with but its getting harder to portage all that stuff to some places.  Float, spinning and casting setups, each has its skill and catches fish.  You cannot say one is better than the other because I have gone to rivers where 30 or more people have drifted a bobber over the same area with the same technique and presentation and the bite has gone off.  I see this, and either bottom bounce out in the fast, deep flowing river where the other fishermen just can't cast or they float through way too fast through it, or I hotshot a Kwikky also where they cannot drift because it is way too deep for them to reach float fishing.  This produces alot of fish and then they wonder what they are doing wrong.  One example is off the piers at the 'geen and another is the Niagara(upper n' lower).  Lets see you floatfish in the Forebay 30 years ago.  I have seen guides send people to some spots to hold so they can bring their clients there later.  Still not happy about that one here.  I have seen many things that young fishermen still need to learn.  Etiquette, manners, releasing fish, the proper way to post fish photo's on the internet and the list goes on.  Sorry to bore you all but cya on the river n' gl there......Rob!"
453402,StoneFly,2010-04-08 03:50:00,574," dude,..just reacting to the insults as they fly at me.  How would you rate holding a fish from diving into a logjam using a centrepin vs. spinner on a float set-up?  theres  many other instances....if you re-read the posts,..it was obviously an attack at me as I supposedly some sort of centrepin elitest...which is total Bull....but again my qustion was to you was,..of your last 3 threads you posted how many of those fish were not caught on a centrepin?  Im betting zero....in addition,..i have stated many times that other presentations ie., flyrod and spinning reel for spinners and spoons can be effective....the main point is that drifting with a spinning rod is inferior to using a centrepin...this is what i have been saying all along....im not sure what is so hard to understand."
453406,MJL,2010-04-08 03:57:00,2427,"Between Sinker and Solo, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was close to 60yrs worth of steelheading knowledge and experience pooled between the both of them – Not to forget the other guys who chimed in…  As far as evolution goes, centrepins are the oldest reels in history developed by the Chinese a few thousand years ago (made of wood) and perfected by the English in the 1400’s…Surely spinning reels and baitcasters (with multiplier gearing and drags) would be the next step…  If I had to choose only 1 reel to take with me on a trip, a 2000 or 2500 sized spinning reel would be my choice for sheer versatility.  I almost always have my spinning reel with me in my bag as a backup as well as for bottom bouncing or tossing lures (often times I bring a dedicated spinning outfit along too).  If I lost the center screw on my pin I could easily use my spinning reel to drift floats down river (Which I did 2wks ago - found the screw in the end though).   From a use perspective, I use a pin for the sheer fun of fighting a fish with it.  The only limitation a spinning reel has for presenting baits or fighting fish is the limitation in skill of the angler using it.  Can you go from total free spool to lock down while fighting a fish with a spinning reel?  Definitely: Just finger the spool with your index finger (not too different from using a pinky as a drag with the pin)…With the right technique you can make the same long, drag-free drifts as well as trot the float back.  Is it easier to drift a float with a centrepin?  Sure, it’s more efficient to use one…Is a centrepin more effective at drifting? No  I don’t believe that anyone here is arguing that spinning reels are more efficient or effective than a centrepin at drifting…They are arguing that spinning reels can be AS effective at drifting given the skills of an angler to adapt and use them.  By ‘effective’ I’m referring to the fact that you can make the same drag free drift as you can with a centrepin.  With regards to bottom bouncing, understandably it’s a different culture on the rivers now (at least for Lake O tribs) – Most guys who are starting the float game now do so with a centrepin.  They don’t think they can use a spinning reel to achieve the same quality of drifts as with a pin (or they get frustrated learning how to or see the growing population of pinners pounding fish – More pinners = more fish caught with pins).  Lake O rivers nowadays are silt choked, slow moving ditches (not that they weren’t before but way more now) which makes bottom bouncing less desirable to do (though still very possible).  If I was faced with a river full of pocket water or stretches of deep, fast flowing water, I wouldn’t hesitate to leave a $1400 float combo behind at home and use my 9ft med action spinning combo to bounce bottom.  If I was going to purposely snag or line a fish, I wouldn’t use a float either…It would save me $2.50 in tackle in case I break off as well as give me a more direct point to snag a fish with. I see tons of float guys run ‘search’ leaders well overdepth attempting to line fish in shin deep water – It works both ways  With all said and done, with the right guidance, a newbie can pick up a spinning reel + float rod and within a 5-10min lesson can pound fish…As EC1 can attest from last December.  I must say, he did have a kick-ass guide…  "
453408,Sinker,2010-04-08 03:58:00,8692,"Its obvious you don't know how to use a spinning reel.....  A center pin will aid in presentation......yes. In fighting a fish....not so much. Haven't you ever used your finger on the spool of a spinning reel?? It comes as second nature to guys who use them. Not to mention a way faster line retrieve, for when they turn and run right at you. A spinning reel is also a lot warmer than holding a solid piece of aluminum in your hand when its freezin cold out. I know for sure you can't cast as far with your pin as I can with a spinning reel too.  You say you don't have the ""elitest"" attitude, but I'd beg to differ, after reading your replies. Your so caught up in it, you don't even realize it."

453411,StoneFly,2010-04-08 04:09:00,574," that is a much more well thought out intelligent reply Rob...and I think you have agreed with what I have said several times....(I should have pointed out the niagara as an exception)  not too many other rivers get to 30'+ deep.  I thought i had made it clear that float/centre pin, spinnin/baitcaster for spinners, and flyrods were 3 methods that are effective in my opinion....yes obviously on the niagara, alot of guys bottom bounce 30' down....but in 4' ; of water....sorry I still dont agree,..but thats fine...Ive seen what ive seen.  And FYI,..i never claimed to be any expert on any of it....but my experience on the rivers has shown me, i do a little better than the average guy...Do i think I am in Solo's league,..no way...he has got 20 years and 30 hours a week to fish ,..lol....I still beleive no matter what he says for the purpose of this thread, he uses a pin for steelhead from the riverbank 95% of the time,..and he has not denied that.  I understand at your age, riverromping is maybe too much...not a dig,..and thats why you sold your pins and bought a chair to bottom bounce.  there are some morning I want to do the same,..but it gets real boring to me.  anyways,..i hope more guys do take up bottom bouncing in the smaller rivers...more fish for me to catch.  and what you mentioned about 'switching it up'..i fully agree,..but not neccesarily for technique...but bait,..shot..etc...i love walking up to a roe pressured hole and dropping in a nymph and get a fish on first drift."

453273,StoneFly,2010-04-08 01:06:00,574, Couldnt you bottom bounce with the pin?  It helps to land a fish way better than spinner.  but also isnt bottom bouncing just about lining/flossing fish in the river?  lol
453280,solopaddler,2010-04-08 01:16:00,8605, 'Course you can bottom bounce with a pin. You can throw hardware as well. It's not the right tool for the job though. As Frankie said sometimes bottom bouncing is the way to go. The very best steelheaders I know started out as primarily bottom bouncers. To become good at it requires a level of skill and touch far beyond centrepinning. Regarding the spinning reel I can't agree that a pin will help you land fish better. It will in most instances allow a much better presentation. That said there's many instances especially in big water where I replace the pin on my float rod with a spinning reel when float fishing. Sometimes the pin is a hindrance.  To be truly good versatility is the key. Master all the disciplines not just one.
453286,StoneFly,2010-04-08 01:28:00,574," Have to disagree with alot of what you are saying!!!  I almost never see anyone bottom bouncing unless they are trying to line the fish.  Controlling the drag with your hand is way better than relying on the spinning reels drag...I constantly see guys loose fish because they cant lock down the way you can with a pin nor control the drag.  Its interesting that 95% of the fish caught are by guys with a Centre pin,..not too mention 90% of Steelheaders use one.  there are all facts.  Most of what you said is heresay,..and I would bet yu use a pin >90% of the time."
453289,solopaddler,2010-04-08 01:31:00,8605,  Well....I'd have to say you have a lot to learn as do the 95% of guys who strictly use a centrepin.

453298,Dara,2010-04-08 01:41:00,3052,I really don't see that it matters a lot what you wind the line up on. Knowing what you are doing at the bussiness end is what counts.
453303,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-08 01:57:00,2690,"Funny, I didn't want this to turn into a war, but, thanks Mike (solopaddler) for your comments! As for the flossing or lining of fish...the stretches I prefer to bottom bounce, I am making long casts, can't see the fish even with polarized glasses...I have seen as many or more guys float fishing with centrepins, force feeding bows on the spawning beds. Centrepin is not the be all and end all of steelheading...many of us caught many bows before a centrepin was even used on Ontario rivers. Again, yes they are awesome tools, but, don't be closed minded. Perhaps you fish mostly the Lake Ontario tribs where it wouldn't surprise me to see guys flossing...a technique I abhor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
453305,Dara,2010-04-08 01:59:00,3052,Just what is flossing?
453306,Sinker,2010-04-08 01:59:00,8692,"I'm with solo. I know for a fact I would catch as many fish with a spinning reel as with a pin. Its not the reel that catches the fish. A guy who knows what he's doing can also present his bait as well as a center pin can, with a spinning reel. Frig, I could present my bait as good with a casting reel. I don't know where the whole center pin mentality came from, but I see it too. If you don't have one, you don't know squat.......gimme a break  I was center pin fishing long before a lot of guys even knew what they were. Back when there were decent numbers of fish in the tribs, and the crowds were bearable. You know, the days when a lot of guys bottom bounced, and used spinning reels. We always caught a lot of fish. If I was to go steelheading right now, I'd use a spinning reel. I KNOW what I can do with BOTH.  S."

452427,StoneFly,2010-04-06 02:56:00,574,You bet I will be and Im rootin for ya...Im just not sure why you agreed with the guy that said all you need is a crappy tire rod and reel when you went out and bought a centre pin....?
452437,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-06 03:14:00,0,there are skilled steelheaders of all sorts.  i got my butt kicked by a drift angler with spinning gear today.
452440,cityfisher,2010-04-06 03:18:00,959,I also like a members only area
452442,irishfield,2010-04-06 03:21:00,26272," There are over 6000 ""members"". A members only section won't change anything. The same ones complaining now would still be doing so there .."
452520,jediangler,2010-04-06 12:56:00,1923,"I belong to a kayak fishing site that allows lurkers to view all the forums except the fishing reports section. They can read up on how to rig various different kayaks, what members suggest for equipment and the buy, sell & trade sections. If they join then they can view the fishing reports section without a minimum post count. If OFC had a members only forum instead of a fishing reports section available to members only, it would still be full of NF crap like it is now. It's not a members only area we need it's a fishing reports area viewable only by the members and post count should not come into play."
452523,Raf,2010-04-06 13:08:00,3495,"jedi, this site is what it is -- too big, too commercial and too full of people who don't fish for anything like that.  that is what those smaller sites are for."
452651,bigfish1965,2010-04-06 17:42:00,3382, and too full of complaints...
452658,cram,2010-04-06 17:53:00,1733,"Guys - this site is great.  Remember that there's always a few bad apples in every bushel, so don't let it bother you when one of them shows himself.  For every 10-20 great guys there are going to be 1 or 2 idiots.  Its simply a matter of volume.  I do like the members only area though. Makes a lot of sense.  I also wonder if you guys thought about grouping threads based on topic...there could be a trout section, a musky section, fly fishing section, etc etc.  It'd be great for access to content and building productive micro-communities amongst the bigger OFC umbrella."
452663,dannyboy,2010-04-06 18:02:00,367,I wouldn't join any club that would have me as a member.  Dan
452670,rock34,2010-04-06 18:11:00,215," I agree with this idea Bill. I better get posting though in order to get past that 100 mark! lol  Seriously though this is a great idea. I also agree that one person ""hammering"" fish on a lake or river doesnt mean that the guy right beside him will.  I have been the guy on both ends of food chain on that one."

452684,cityfisher,2010-04-06 18:48:00,959,true but probably another 15000 lurkers
452746,raptorfan,2010-04-06 21:32:00,126,"  That isn't the exact point I was agreeing with.  I was more agreeing with the fact that their are fishing eliteists who think you have to spend $1000 on a set up to be a true fisherman and look down on those who use cheaper equipment.  Same with alot of games, golf per say."
452788,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-06 22:56:00,2690,"Exactly, and, I didn't specifically mean cheap equipment for steelheading, I use a Diawa Tierra spinning reel and up until a few years ago a fairly expensive Fenwick rod...as far as catching steelhead, I have fished Lake Huron tribs for over 25 years, before many of the guys reading this were even born. All I was saying was any angler that shows respect for nature and the fishery, whether they can afford a $1000 outfit or a $40 one...should be judged equally. It all comes down to LOVING THE SPORT OF FISHING...not turning it into some contest of who has the most expensive rod and reel. Have fun out there people, THAT is what it is all about!!!!!!! Also, apologies to Doc, his original thread has turned into a bunch of rants about other topics, not necessarily a bad thing, but, just wanted to say that I love reading his reports as well.  Don't change for one guys opinion!"

451917,bigfish1965,2010-04-05 02:57:00,3382,"Okay the problem with a 100+ forum is that eventually all the action slides into there. Then we get the main section dying a slow death. We can deal with it this way... People can post any pics they want. Don't like it?? Too bad...go away. I have never understood this issue and it seems to be trout guys. You do yourself no favours by coming off as elitist idiots.  Here..I will prove a point.. I have caught well over 100 ten pound walleye in Port Dalhousie from shore. I don't care who knows cause it will take a big amount of time and effort to figure out the rest. And if you are that dedicated, you deserve it. Heck if you PM me I might even meet you down there are show you how I do it. But there is still a touch to it... I have gone down with Aaron Shirley and other guys and it is alot of work..but well worth it. Supposed to go with Crazyhook but he keeps bailing  We, collectively, own the fish...not just guys with fancy equipment. I see alot of guys complaining on other boards that they have to share the water with guys using a different system..that is amazingly arrogant.  So lets just ignore and block the idiots and have fun doing what we do."

As far as the fancy equipment and whatnot...I have bottom bounced certain sections of the Saugeen river for over 25 years, and, will continue to do so for (hopefully) at least 25 more...I don't care how many guys fish there with extremely expensive centrepin reels.  Give me a good spinning reel with a smooth drag and a 9-10 1/2 ft rod and I'm good to go.  I also hate to see elitists in the angling fraternity...if a guy wants to go catch some fish with a ""Walmart special"" rod and reel and some worms, so be it.  It isn't expensive equipment that makes the angler."
451996,bigugli,2010-04-05 12:02:00,6138,That would cause a huge loss in the revenue stream and some form of fee structure.

452014,torco,2010-04-05 13:28:00,656,"Hey Doc,  Keep posting your reports and that goes for the rest of the members. If you want to blur backgrounds and what not go for it, I know how it is down here in southern ontario but I love to see peoples reports and not because I want to steal there spots. Its just great way to take a break at work, cheer yourself up when life doesn't allow you the time to get out fishing.  I am fairly new to the board, don't post much but do try to post when I can add value and have learned a lot from what others have posted. If we start segregating the members based on post numbers I think we let the bad lurkers win. I'm sure some are just lurkers because they lack confidence to post. I know I lurked for almost a year before joining and I guess it was a strange confidence thing for me which was quickly left after I made my first couple posts."

I still think the minimum requirement idea of 100 posts for a ""special"" members forum is a good idea. I think I know which forum Bill is referring to as I am a member there as well...the requirement is quite a bit less than 100, but, it does cut down on lurkers. I also agree with Steve R...I don't even bother reporting my steelhead trips, between either having to distort backgrounds, or worry about somebody taking your virtual head off for showing them it just isn't worth the hassle.  That said, I still enjoy reading these reports when posted by Mike or Bill or whomever...I take it for what it is...enjoyment of the sport.  There aren't too many secrets left out there, and, I am darn sure that any of those special spots are well guarded by the guys (as they should be)!!!! Going way back to the beginning of this post, don't let it bother you Doc, not worth it!"

451823,Dara,2010-04-05 00:58:00,3052,I really can't figure out what  guide from t Bay would be upset about fishing steelhead in the Sault. I can understand a guy from the south not wanting people to head up to the sault because he would loose customers. T Bay has as good or better steelhead fishing. I would think he would be happy that sal was getting guys pumped up to get out and newbs would call the guide for a few trips.  Nope..I don't get it.
451825,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-05 01:02:00,4399,"I think the mods should ban fishing reports all together!

451835,Cookslav,2010-04-05 01:14:00,1457," You already said it Doc... I've identified a couple of spots in a few members posts, but the truth is I recognize it...cause I fish it.

451838,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-05 01:16:00,2690,"Valid points, but, how many people are going to actually bother doing that? Anyways it was a thought/suggestion that I'm sure the ""mods"" have already considered. In the end it comes down to the point that for better or worse the internet and fishing forums exist...if you don't like them...don't use them. Like anything else dealing with a large group of people, you will have many opinions.  You will also have arguments, it just isn't worth taking them personally...two guys on another forum were ready to come to blows over comments made...ironically they met on a cruise ship not long ago...one of them recoginised the other, they talked and came to terms sharing a few ""pops"" over the duration of the cruise.

451714,Syn,2010-04-04 20:21:00,519,I was at another fishing forum where the fishing reports are separated from the main forum. The only way to access the fishing reports is to submit a detailed fishing report of your own. When your fishing report is approved by the mods then you are granted access to the others fishing reports. Also noticed the fishing reports were subdivided geographically for easy reference.
451715,BillM,2010-04-04 20:21:00,17367," We are talking about a sub forum where fishing reports would go....  So instead of posting reports in the main forum, they'd go into a 'members' forum..  In order to read this forum you'd need 100-200 posts..  This is done on one particular forum I visit and works pretty well."
451716,steverowbotham,2010-04-04 20:26:00,1800,I've stopped posting steelhead and brook trout reports all together.  Not worth the hassle for me anymore.

451721,archie_james_c,2010-04-04 20:34:00,618,"  Keep postin' Sal, you are a smart guy I enjoy reading and learning from your posts.  If this ""guide"" in town here is worth a damn at all he shouldn't need to rely on a couple spots that some scrawny fish geek frequents    Kidding...  Seems to me theres alot of white trash hunters/fisherman in our town that no nothing about the sports, just know a few hot spots they stumbled on...when they find them they try and brag about their ""secret lake"".  Pretty pathetic if you ask me."
451726,StoneFly,2010-04-04 20:57:00,574," I agree with your last Statement...although how often do you catch fish without Solo?  or how many did you catch before you met him?  Lol...J/K  As for Backgrounds,..to each his own,..personally I crop mine out as I have personally witnessed hoards of people the next day at a spot with a background posted when there none the day before.  It is true that 90% of the fish are caught by 10% of the anglers,..to a degree...however,..part of that is the intuition to know where to go and when...and its much more rewarding fishing a hole with a couple buddies and not 10 other guys."
451728,irishfield,2010-04-04 21:00:00,26272,The guide should be happy Doc... if your posts were raising so much awareness to the area's tribs.. his phone should be ringing off the hook !!
451732,BillM,2010-04-04 21:07:00,17367," I changed the background in my most recent report because it was a dead giveaway as to where we were.  And honestly if we are down in PA or OH I really couldn't care less.  If guys are going to make that drive they deserve to catch as many fish as they can.  But even you know it could be hot one day and cold the next...  I did pretty good for a rube before I met Mike surprisingly enough.  First day out with a pin ever I nailed a shaker out on the 'Geen.  Next time I went out with a few of the boys from the board and we did great on a few Lake O east ditches.  However my learning curve shot through the roof when I started to fish with Mike.  Now anytime I go, I'm fairly confident I'll bank a few regardless if anyone around me is or not."
451735,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-04 21:11:00,0,"he says he doesn't guide ""for profit""... is this volunteer guiding?  why does someone who lives in the northwest region aka thunder bay travel all the way to wawa to guide then give me balls about my home stretch about lake superior?  if you don't like it, stay on your side of the lake buddy."
451739,BillM,2010-04-04 21:21:00,17367,Yeah and I work for free at work
451740,StoneFly,2010-04-04 21:24:00,574," ""Even I know""  lol...yes I know it VERY well...one hour to the next even...there is alot to be said to get fed tips and follow more experienced anglers around,..there something else to be said for using your own intuition and getting into fish everytime as well.   For me the later is half the challenge   Like finding new spots and new holes on your own.  Like I said elsewhere, I love sleeping in,..and as the crowd clears out becasue the bite hasnt turned on yet,..then showing up with the river relatively to yourself and they ALWAYS turn on,..its just a matter of what you do...another part I love is watching a dozen guys walk right past a spot,..that may not look like a hole,..then jump down and nail a fish first drift....or walk up on a roe pressured hole and drop in a nymph and slam a fish first drift...ahhhhhhhhhhh Steelheading....its different everytime...and so many options and intracacy's....gotta love it!!!"
451743,BillM,2010-04-04 21:33:00,17367,"Everytime out is an education.  Bit after a while you start to figure things out on your own, which is always good.  I hit the Credit last year all by my lonesome and cleaned up pretty well...  Just gotta apply the knowledge you've learned.  And don't get me wrong, there are days when I get absolutely skunked and my buddies do fairly well.  The best part is learning why you didn't catch any fish, change it up, go back and lay a beating on them..  Now THAT is a great feeling.  We did a fair bit of 'educating the locals' on Friday, that's for sure, lol."
451746,StoneFly,2010-04-04 21:45:00,574," I think if I stopped learning, it would lose something for me...Everyone gets skunked at some point, especially if you just are heading out to get out...sometimes there just arent any fish,..lol.  I think Mid-Notty in the early spring is a good example...with the stretch being so long and the dynamics of that river and how high it can go and how long it takes to clear out,..the runs could be anywhere...I think only 2 points will give you as close to a guarentee as possible in the spring and one of them is off lmits,..the mouth area with the right conditions....and then the dam at nicolston...totally closed right now...but sure fun to watch them try to jump it.    it seemed to be only the smaller to mid-size fish trying to jump and not even getting close,..maybe the repeaters know the ladder is just to the left,..lol"
451749,BillM,2010-04-04 21:48:00,17367,"The Notty is still my nemesis, lol...  Takes a while to figure out that river for sure."
451755,StoneFly,2010-04-04 21:59:00,574," Notty is where I learned and exclusively fished the first few years almost never getting skunked...although in the last couple years I gotta admit she has kicked my butt a few times...the flow charts help,..but vis is a tough one in the spring and not always related to levels at all...I find it easier to fish in the fall for sure as its more predicatble.  you probably know as much about it as I do,..but your Jedi master Han solo might be able to help you out.   If not...Im up for trading spots any old time."
451766,StoneFly,2010-04-04 22:40:00,574,Back to the original point by the Doc...it is interesting though...right now there are 65 members online and 57 guests (lurkers)...thats kindof odd...why not join?  takes what about 30 seconds?
451771,fish_fishburn,2010-04-04 22:57:00,1311,"I'm only six hours from Tbay, I hope I never get a hold of that guide when I come up there to fish. I hate to pay for something I can get from my fellow members for free. Keep em coming Doc and don't sweat the small stuff. The world is full of clowns. Maybe you should show us all his spots hehe."
451772,raptorfan,2010-04-04 23:00:00,126," I can agree with this to the word.  Also, as has been said by a few, the learning is the funnest part.  I notice improvements with myself every day trying to pin and it makes me feel much better about the efforts I am putting in to one day be a good steelheader.  I know solo told me it is the easiest fish to catch, which I am sure had some sarcasm to it, but once I have the experience he does I hope that I can be as good at it as many of you are.  Dr sal, don't listen to the haters man.  As many others have said I really enjoy your posts and videos.  Always good to see good people having great days on the water man.  Keep em coming.  Shawn"
451778,StoneFly,2010-04-04 23:11:00,574," Shawn, did you get skunked again?  I was hoping to see your first post...that said...the lake O north side Fish have either moved up or have been caught several times and with this heat stress and barriers to moving up...better to leave em alone right now....its gonna rain this week which should bring a fresh run..try your luck next weekend...  As for getting as experienced as Han Solo,..Well I think he has been at it over 20 years...so that may take awhile  As for Steelhead being the easiest fish to catch...that is true to a degree...when they are on,...they will hit anything with the sloppiest presentation....but when they are aren't,..well you have to get creative...and half the battle is right time right place.   After that...the men get seperated from the boys"
451779,BillM,2010-04-04 23:15:00,17367,"Yup, you gotta be a part time weatherman sometimes"
451790,raptorfan,2010-04-04 23:41:00,126,"Saturday morning when me and my boy headed out, it ended up being more of a hike and scenery walk than a fishing excursison.  He had a lot of fun though.  I am slowly learning to use the charts and follow the weather I think, but it seems to be the hardest part of the learning curve.  I have always been of the belief though that nothing worthwhile is ever easy to learn.  I had an offer from a guide on here that I am most definately going to take up.  Just waiting to hear back from him.  Till then though, I will live vicariously through all you experienced guys, and wait for all the congratulations when I get into one on my pin"
451791,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-04 23:42:00,0,i've been watching flow charts all day and i'm getting a little sweaty right now just thinking about it.  things are looking good.
451794,phiphntek,2010-04-04 23:47:00,115,  here here.......your pics are awesome
451796,StoneFly,2010-04-04 23:51:00,574, Dabbling in atmospheric meterology and climatology when I was in school and then being a supplier to the landscape industry I must admit I have a knack for predicting weather... Heck I remember working from my office with an eye on the radar letting some key clients know their crews were in for a a flash storm...5 min before it happened...understanding weather is key and the radar is your best friend is you know how to use it.  Oh yes for river fishing also   for real..peeps that have know me well have told me to get into it full time...but meh...maybe some day!!!
451641,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-04 16:23:00,0,"For the second time in as many months someone has joined the forum for the sole purpose of lecturing me on posting reports which they feel are too revealing because of my ""hero shots"".  What gives?  I generally post pics of me with beached fish or closeups of fish etc...  if you can identify a river by seeing a fish, a few spruce trees and some rocks then wouldn't you already KNOW where that spot it?  Can I do anything to deter people from continuing to bust my balls over this?  It's a real deterrent to posting future reports when I have to take flack all the time."
451646,laszlo,2010-04-04 16:29:00,487,Your posts are great and they don't reveal too much at all. Just brush it off and don't let it get to you man. Keep it up!
451647,splashhopper,2010-04-04 16:30:00,2931,"Hi Doc: I am not sure if my input is what you are wanting to hear... but living in Southern Ontario is a bugger sometimes when t comes to posting identifiable features on waterways.  In the short 4 years I have been fishing, it is disgusting at how many times some places are over run with ppl that ""heard about this spot on the net"".  Not living in the Sault, I don't recognize any of the places u fish. That is not the case down here in our VERY populated regions.  I wonder if some of the ""lecturers"" know the region where you reside in?  Your posts are always informing and a beautiful trip for some of us to take,,,, PLEASE don;t stop posting... this member appreciates your adventures vicariously .  Sincerely  Splashhopper"
451648,Dozer,2010-04-04 16:31:00,896," The way you feel is probably the same reason why we don't see more reports.  I love your reports dude, keep 'em comin' and screw the haters."
451650,bigfish1965,2010-04-04 16:44:00,3382,"Please feel free to forward those PM's to me and they will be dealt with quickly. No worries, they won't be able to bother anyone again after that. We will not tolerate cowards using the PM system to harass members."
451652,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-04 16:47:00,0,he claims to be a guide...  so i can't reveal locations but he'll take you to them for money. hypocrite.
451654,solopaddler,2010-04-04 16:58:00,8605,"I deal with it all the time, imo don't worry about it. Unless it's an extremely remote location I never name the spot. If someone happens to recognize it then as you said they're already aware of it."
451665,danbouck,2010-04-04 17:19:00,4380,"Do what I do and make up locations that don't exist. Except when I'm on a big lake, then it doesn't matter. I don't have any issues sharing spots with people that are active on the board by PM."
451667,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-04 17:24:00,0,"apparently it's not ""giving away the location""...  it's promoting steelheading on lake superior in general that bugs this GUIDE...  "
451672,BillM,2010-04-04 17:41:00,17367,"He sounds like an ass, I wouldn't worry about it to much."
451678,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-04 17:55:00,0,you better watch out bill!  i saw that report you posted today!  i'm hopping in my car today!  all i need to do is drive around and find the background that appears in your photo!
451679,jediangler,2010-04-04 18:00:00,1923,"I believe it's time OFC started a sub-forum just for reports, and like many other forums, it should be viewable only by the members. Let the lurkers read the posts about repairing outboards, seminars by tv fishing hosts, how to cook an easter turkey, why my toilet doesn't work, where to store your boat, how to build a deer blind, how thieves can steal your money from a bank machine, happy birthday wishes, and pictures of vintage motorcycles. They will either join the forum and eventually become contributing members or find another place to poach fishing spots."
451680,Sinker,2010-04-04 18:00:00,8692,"Well, the way I see it is its not the spot that catches the fish. I can send 10 guys to a spot I fish, and only a couple of them will manage to figure out how to catch the fish there. Don't worry about it bud, you should mention this guides name so every one knows what a tool he is  S."
451681,BillM,2010-04-04 18:01:00,17367,HAHAHA!!!!!  I PS'd it so well you'll be looking forever!!!
451683,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-04 18:05:00,0," anonymous - although it was suggested that i ""might be surprised"" by who it is.  not sure what that means."
451685,fishinfool,2010-04-04 18:11:00,366," I feel your pain Dr Salvelinus. It just seems we have to put up with a handful of righteous members who have nothing better to do... I wish they would go fishing and stop harassing the ones who are on this site for what it was originally intended for, sharing their fishing adventures."
451686,BillM,2010-04-04 18:14:00,17367,"I think most of the people complaining about the reports are the ones that show up, expecting a slam and only witness everyone else around them catching fish.  Same thing with steelheading..  Someone makes a report, people get their panties in a bunch, drive to the river, catch squat then blame the reports because of it.  You ever wonder why the same guys go to the same river and catch fish regardless?  It's got nothing to do with internet fishing reports I'll tell you that."
451687,Swan_Dive,2010-04-04 18:21:00,46,I think your posts are awsome and I think you should continue to share your trips.  Like you said if someone can figure out where you are by a picture of the shore then they already know the area and shouldn't worry about it.
451692,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-04 18:51:00,2690,I totally agree...have a members only forum!!!!!
451694,BillM,2010-04-04 18:56:00,17367,So people will join up only to lurker the members forum....  If anything you need to have a certain amount of posts in order to view the members forum...100-200 or something similar.  That would weed out the lurkers for sure.
451696,fishinfool,2010-04-04 19:00:00,366, When they are trying to become a member they should have to contribute 15 or twenty posts before actually being able to view the members only forum. A lot of them will give up at this point if they are just looking for a spot to fish that day.
451702,EC1,2010-04-04 19:29:00,930,"This guide sure is greedy....Almost as much as the RLTA! Anyways, I say continue with the pictures! I for sure don't know where your pictures are from, but I enjoy those pictures much more than those that have swirly backgrounds and such!"
451705,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-04 19:34:00,2690,"Absolutely...100 would be a good number to start with...anybody that takes the time to make at least that many posts, would (hopefully) be worthy of member status!"
451707,smitter,2010-04-04 19:43:00,106,"Don't pay attention to the haters, your reports are great!  You're right that anybody who can recognize the river based on a picture of it already knows there are fish there.  Also, anybody who would send you a critical e-mail without identifying themselves isn't worth listening to in the first place."
451709,skeeter,2010-04-04 20:00:00,1907,"im confused. how does a new member post 100-200 posts if they can not read any posts? they cant ask any questions cause they cant read the replies. they cant answer any posts cause they cant read them.  this is why there are administrators & moderators. if they see a problem they deal with it right then. if they dont see the problem (PM) you need to let them know.  BTW Dr. Salvelinus, keep those posts coming, 6000+ enjoy them."
