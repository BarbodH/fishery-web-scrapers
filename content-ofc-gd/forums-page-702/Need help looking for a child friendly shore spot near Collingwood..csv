453139,wuchikubo,2010-04-07 18:58:00,1114,"Hi Everyone,  I've got a couple of days I need to be up near Collingwood for work and will have my kids up there with me too. I was wondering if anyone could PM me any place(s) where I could take the kids (9 & 6) for some shoreline panfish for a few hours. I know there are some trout rivers there but I don't think my kids will have the patience for them (using the 15 minute time span equation). I will be up there just before the trout opener (24th).  Thanks,  Stan"
453166,Fisherman,2010-04-07 20:13:00,7201,"I think you're pretty much out of luck for panfish around Collingwood, you ""might"", and that's a mighty big might get the rare bite on the inside of the harbour at the old grain mills.  Wish you luck."
453183,ketchenany,2010-04-07 20:45:00,3229,You want to try the private ponds just south of Collingwood on Hwy 24 and just north of 33 sideroad 
453220,wuchikubo,2010-04-07 23:31:00,1114,"Thanks Fisherman and Ketchenany for your replies.  I don't think fishing in a private pond will be an option.  I will have to try and look up any bait & tackle shop up that way then.  Thanks a bunch again,  Stan"
453229,misfish,2010-04-07 23:58:00,29133," There was a time,way back.We use to catch alot of perch of the mills FM.  You can still catch some pike and the odd  rainbows and whites there this time of year.  Stan,grab a bag of minnows, and give it a try.Atleast you and the the young ones got out.  Try the first part of the harbour.Just where you first get to the water.  Oh.Please make sure they are wearing a PFD.  Dont forget your camera to take pics of the swans."
453244,Fisherman,2010-04-08 00:23:00,7201," Hahaha, now you're dating yourself"
453254,misfish,2010-04-08 00:35:00,29133,"Stop laughing,Im still younger then you.  Oh ya,stay off my docks."
453270,Fisherman,2010-04-08 01:01:00,7201," Ya, but you are always catching up, no way around that one    Careful of the banana peel on the dock.."
453500,wuchikubo,2010-04-08 13:10:00,1114," Thanks Brian,  I'm looking at Google Maps and not sure which marina/docks you are talking about, could you PM me the closest road (as I don't frequent Collingwood at all)? I can't locate the grain mill you mentioned.  Thanks, Stan"
453504,wuchikubo,2010-04-08 13:14:00,1114,Looks like I'll be able to pick up some free bait today (worms are out).
453519,Fisherman,2010-04-08 14:11:00,7201,"It's the road that leads to the grain elevators, one street east of the main lights in town on highway 26. The boat launch is on the left side of the road, although as of last week, the docks had not been put in.  Good luck."
453661,wuchikubo,2010-04-08 21:36:00,1114,Thanks Fisherman! I will check it out.
