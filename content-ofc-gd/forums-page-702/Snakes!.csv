452704,ehg,2010-04-06 19:26:00,2666,Went with my 7 yr. old daughter for our annual easter snake hunt. Riding bikes around Toronto harbourfront was cool.     Found some snakes to add to the fun.      These little puny Dekay's or little brown snakes are tough to catch.     A diversion on a beautiful Easter weekend!  Can't wait till June for the muskies however.

452886,pike n' whities,2010-04-07 02:10:00,131,seems like a fun idea! i hear them things are pretty tasty.... according to bear grylls
452897,pike slayer,2010-04-07 02:28:00,1177,so is your daughter keeping them to put in mommys bed while shes sleeping??
452965,bridge,2010-04-07 11:53:00,54,Cool report Ehg.  I take my 3yr old out every couple of days looking for snakes or what ever else we can find in the reveen across the street from our house at Jane/Sheppard.  Its amazing what you can see in the city if your looking.  Snakes are one of my favourites.
452979,Dara,2010-04-07 12:30:00,3052,  I have also found that there is no shortage of snakes in the city.  Cool report though. Girls shouldn't be afraid of crawly things...but warn her of the other snakes
453009,Carp,2010-04-07 13:47:00,1488,"We were at a hockey tournament in Waterloo last weekend and had some time to kill, so went to the banks of the Grand river. A nice trail along the shore and the kids found one of them slithery critters crossing our path.  Nice pics.  thanks"
453032,MJL,2010-04-07 14:34:00,2427,Super cool pics!  Totally neat the wildlife you can find around the city.
453071,Syn,2010-04-07 16:00:00,519,Your child is braver than I am. I am too scared to hold a snake the size of that bigger one in the pic. No problem holding a 2-3 ft lizard.
453194,ehg,2010-04-07 21:32:00,2666,Thanks for the replies again!    Started doing this when my daughter was three as well.    The snakes like rubbly overgrown warm sunny areas this time of year. Have found them 100m from City Hall in downtown Toronto in abandoned parking lots even.
453197,Mykester,2010-04-07 21:38:00,241,Lol I need to try this. When I was younger I came across a lot while biking and I ran away with bricks being bull.
453235,bucktail,2010-04-08 00:06:00,1857,"I grew up in Gimli Manitoba, its home to limestone pits that host 1000""s of hibernating garters. Always like to see them around shows a good ecosystem!"
453287,Toronto_Angler,2010-04-08 01:30:00,698,Snakes! Why did it have to be Snakes?!
453302,Paully,2010-04-08 01:53:00,712,"""Im sick of these Monday to Friday snakes on this monday to friday plane!"".. if it were on superstation.. they hack everything"
453419,Stern Rules,2010-04-08 04:27:00,342,"I agree with Syn, your child is pretty brave. Wouldn't catch me touching those things."
453448,Cudz,2010-04-08 06:06:00,2652,That brings back fond memories. I remember living in BC as a 6 year old and catching gater snakes and racing them against each other. My kids too love catching them and have done so quite often here.  It is funny because I too am more aprehensive about picking them up than I used to be. Here are a couple of pics of my older daughters and their snakes.
