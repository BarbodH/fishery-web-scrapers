452024,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-05 13:49:00,655,"I hit the Niagara on Saturday with a friend Mitch, and we absolutely hammered them  After a couple of lousy trips, I needed this! Well over 20 fish to the boat - stopped counting after a dozen. The action was so good, we didn't take many photos, we just wanted to get back in the water! All damage done on a brand new prototype soft single egg. Not one fish on roe? One laker on a bass Trigger X pink worm.  American guides were asking me all day ""what the heck are you using?"". To which I replied ""a new soft single egg that isn't available yet"", to their dismay. I gave a few of the new eggs to US guide John Delorenzo to try, and he smashed fish until they were gone, then had a tough time. He boated up to me after and said ""are you kidding me? I can't get these things right now?"". Haha, afraid not John, you'll have to wait until next year. Here are some pics from our day.                    Mitch has some pics on his camera of himself.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
452051,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-05 14:45:00,2690,"Great report and ""pics"" as usual Aaron...the prototype, looks alot like single egg yarn flies that I have had success with. Beauty bows!!"
452060,dave524,2010-04-05 14:58:00,4508,"Nice report and pics, looks like someone brought back the Luhr Jensen Jensegg of twenty-some years ago."
452067,Joey,2010-04-05 15:22:00,9122,"Oh sure, you have a secret weapon  Great report Aaron, thought we saw your boat out there.  Glad you had a super day.  As discussed in our PM, next time we'll call and do the tour so we can learn the Hole to be safe.  Joey"
452225,I'mHooked,2010-04-05 21:56:00,525,"Wow, nice day for sure!  It was good talking to you at the Sportsman show (Sunday around lunch time).   I'mHooked"
452236,BillM,2010-04-05 22:21:00,17367,"Aaron, I am sad to report you just destroyed the fishery on the Niagara because now there will be a million boats out there tomorrow, lol    Those are some hogs!!!!!!  Good job man!"
452330,WeedLine,2010-04-06 01:01:00,322,Solid fish. Very nice
452390,young_one,2010-04-06 02:04:00,620,"Beautiful pictures, the colours are unbelievable. What camera/lens was being used?"
452393,hawk-eye,2010-04-06 02:06:00,141,"Great work, keep up the reports, you got yourself a great camera man"
452397,MJL,2010-04-06 02:07:00,2427,Well done Aaron...Beauty fish all around
452432,solopaddler,2010-04-06 03:06:00,8605,"Nice bullets man, great job!"
452434,StoneFly,2010-04-06 03:09:00,574, WOW...  ...I hope it still is that hot in 2 weeks!!!
452435,Kinger,2010-04-06 03:10:00,351,Nice fish for sure!!  Single egg ftw.
452497,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-06 11:29:00,655,"Thanks everyone. Not all trips are this good, so I appreciate the ones that rock!  Young_one, I use a full body Kodak Z980. 12mp, 24 optical zoom and smart Capture so it takes great pics in most conditions with great colours. I just like to point and shoot for quick release on fish. It has a wide angle lens and is the best digi cam I have ever used.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
452498,Cast Adventures,2010-04-06 11:43:00,74,well looks like after the weekend all the steelhead have gone back to the lake......runs over......can't wait till the fall! good to see you the other day!
452502,canadadude,2010-04-06 11:48:00,769,hahahahahahahah
452534,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-06 13:25:00,655,LMAO Paul.   Haha
453205,ball9320,2010-04-07 22:14:00,26,"Looks like an awesome day, I've yet to fish steelhead by boat but am thinking about heading down to the Niagara sometime next week. If you don't mind me asking where is the most convenient place to launch?"
453221,douG,2010-04-07 23:41:00,2693,"Head for the church.  St. Saviour's Anglican Church at 12 Princess Street, Queenston, ON L0S 1L0  Get Directions (905) 262-5111.  Put that into yer google maps, hit sattelite view, and all will be revealed, Grasshopper."
453231,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-08 00:00:00,0,Just awesome. I love the niagara reports whether from shore or on water.
453242,ball9320,2010-04-08 00:19:00,26,"Thanks, Satellite maps are great! Just another question, on an american site it advises not to fish upstream of the Lewiston bridge without a guide if you have limited experience on the river due to fast current. I know the fishing is still pretty good up to and past the hydro dam just wondering how dangerous the water is, I'm in a 16.5 foot 35hp boat with trolling motor and such, just don't want to get into something nasty unexpectedly."
453277,douG,2010-04-08 01:14:00,2693,"Don't do it, Davey."
453459,Minnow,2010-04-08 06:45:00,177,Wow! Nice fish and the colours on them are gorgeous!
453497,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-08 13:00:00,655,"Thanks everyone, it is nice to have a great day out.  Ball9320, please go with a guide, that is a very small boat and it is serious water. Catching chrome isn't worth your life. For the cost of a good guide, you can't go wrong.  A couple of years ago, a big whirlpool opened up and sucked in a 20' guide boat and killed 2 of the 3 people."
