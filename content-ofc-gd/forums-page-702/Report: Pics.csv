452470,TDunn,2010-04-06 05:17:00,680,"With this awesome spring we have been having, I have been really enjoying getting out on the tribs. Lately, I've been fishing with my 2 cousins in both the St Marys rapids and a handful of Superiors tribs. Although many of my early trips were quick, Ive been making it out more frequently and will continue this trend until the end of the season. Here are a few glory and scenary shots from in and around the Soo.                                     Last week, we decided to take my cousin Teds boat out of storage and take it for run on the St Marys to test out the new graph. We only hit one fish for our efforts but it was a good looking atlantic for the river this time of year.     The night before walleye closed last week, Ted and I hit a lake just outside of the Soo for some eyes. We jigged 3"" gulp at the mouth of a river in a small 12 footer. The bite was on and we decided to keep a couple small males for the pan.     Hope you enjoyed and I plan to make a full report of a day soon!  TDunn"
