Nothin majorly big but there were decent 8-10 inchers, plenty of fish though over 60 between me and rob. Heres a couple teasers since rob will prolly post a full report later.     at one point the fish died down for a couple min then someone caught a walleye(on a 2 inch grub) when they started hitting again i got this dude.   **sorry for the horrible grammar, lazy."
