453143,anders,2010-04-07 19:09:00,1168,Awsome video!  Thanks for sharing...just solidifies my urge to get up there and fish!
453146,MJL,2010-04-07 19:15:00,2427,Congrats on some nice fish...Awesome video Dave  Do you use an auger like this? 
453155,solopaddler,2010-04-07 19:50:00,8605,"This deserved to be bumped up. I've watched the vid a couple times now buddy, just amazing.  On a side note Eddie watched it last night and wants to head up there next winter. He was pretty impressed."
453168,bigugli,2010-04-07 20:15:00,6138,That was one fandamtastic trip. A trip of a lifetime.  Thank you for the video.
453173,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-07 20:23:00,10439,  Don't even have to click on the link to know what it is. Those augers are needed a little further North. This is mine.     Thanks Mike. Tell Eddie it's best to come in the spring as camping in -40 temps pretty much SUCKS!!!!
453418,Moosebunk,2010-04-08 04:26:00,3970,"Finally got a moment to sit down and take that in.  Man... if it wasn't for a wife and kids I'd be destined for a place like Yellowknife or Whitehorse.  Love the shorelines, the skidoo travel, your ""mint"" camp and especially those beauty lakers.  Thanks for the report.  Stellar vid too.  Sadly didn't have volume at work so may have to watch it again for a listen."
451876,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-05 02:04:00,10439,"My buddy Terry from BC came up for a little ice fishing, NWT style. While we didn't land any true giants we did have our chances. This video chronicles the 8 day journey chasing lakers on the ice roads of the area. Enjoy!!!  Lake Trout Video"
451880,ciscokid,2010-04-05 02:14:00,52,"Maybe not as big as some of the monster up there but decent lake trout anyday. Nice work. Awsome background as well, i d love to pend a few years up there before i die. Looks incredible."
451881,irishfield,2010-04-05 02:15:00,26272,Great stuff Dave !!! Sure beat anything that's on TV! Love the camp...
451888,WeedLine,2010-04-05 02:21:00,322,That was a great video. Must have been a memorable trip. I like that tune as well so it made watching the vid even better. Thanks
451889,trapshooter,2010-04-05 02:23:00,1234,Great vid Dave.  Your winter camp looks awesome.  Love the night shots of it with the fire going.  Some nice trout too.
451890,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-05 02:23:00,0,thanks for that.  very enjoyable!
451896,Leecher,2010-04-05 02:32:00,7832,"Awesome report and video Dave Loved the bit where your friend Terry was fighting the big'un at the end I see that you had the extension on the auger   still lots of ice up there.... are there any additional trips that you're going to undertake cause by the looks of it, you've got some pretty safe ice  Again awesome footage and thanks for taking the time to share with us Leechman"
451910,Sinker,2010-04-05 02:49:00,8692,"Nice job on the video Dave. Looks like a great trip! You guys got into some nice fish too!! That camp is great......did you use it as a base camp, and move around fishing? I would love to do a trip like that sometime......especially up in that neck of the woods!!  S."
451915,raptorfan,2010-04-05 02:57:00,126,thank you for that awesome video.......that would be a dream
451927,waterwolf,2010-04-05 03:14:00,556,"can't imagine headin' out with dual trailers of equipment just to survive. man that's some big cahonaes. just a great report . great photos of some solid lakers . love the bright yellow fins on a couple of those biggens. fantastic camp set-up .once in a life time experience for so many ,, thanks for the trip."
451938,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-05 03:32:00,10439,"Thanks fellas!!!1  Sinker, yes the camp was used as a base camp. It was set up about 165kms from Yellowknife on the East Arm of Great Slave Lake. We left right from my door and travelled about 110kms on an ice road supplying a mining exploration camp off the Hearn Channel. We spent 1 day getting there, 3/4 of a day getting the camp in order, 1 day getting back and 2 1/2 days fishing. Then we spent a couple of days running the diamond road made famous by the ice road truckers show.  Leechman, yep we have a little ice left yet. Yesterday we drilled through as much as five feet of the hard stuff. No more trips like that but I will be heading out every weekend until the shoreline goes. Mostly to the lake a friends cabin is on. Not many biguns' but I usually catch a few good eaters.  ciscokid, yeah there were some decent ones in there but of course the bigun's managed to escape capture. A combination of short rods, barbless hooks and bad luck are to blame. At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!! I had one on on day 4 that was a dandy. I thought I had bottom for several seconds before it slowly swam off and the hook pulled!! There's always next year though."
451944,Grimace,2010-04-05 03:43:00,2020,That is awesome.  Nice set up.  Wicked fish.
451981,fish_fishburn,2010-04-05 10:38:00,1311,"Great video, thanks."
451983,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-05 10:49:00,3761,Awesome video guys. Must of been a great experience
451988,Spiel,2010-04-05 11:07:00,9065,Hardcore.
451998,dave524,2010-04-05 12:09:00,4508,"Best fishing video I think I've ever seen, tells a story, great footage and great fish, music is even good. As Irishfield said "" Beats anything on TV "" take the commercials and product promotions out of any 1/2 hour TV show and they pale in comparison to the content of that short video."
451999,danbouck,2010-04-05 12:10:00,4380,Amazing Vid
452019,ehg,2010-04-05 13:43:00,2666,"Many, many thanks for posting this  :Gonefishing:  The ice road exploration shows are all the rage on TV these days."
452021,Roy,2010-04-05 13:46:00,13728,"Fantastic report Dave! And yes, great choice on the tune. You realize of course that without having ""fixed"" the backgrounds, the next time you get out there, you'll be shoulder to shoulder with wannabees eh? I'm sure that lots of folks wish they had done the trip but lots of those folks don't have the garbonzos to actually pull it off.  Congrats to you and your bud Terry. Thanks for showing us."
452038,johnnyb,2010-04-05 14:11:00,3413,"That was amazing, Dave...I would easily give up a season's worth of outings to do that trip...maybe a couple seasons.  AWESOME!!!"
452044,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-05 14:27:00,10439,"  Yes, I thought of that, but believe that the artistic value of leaving the backgrounds in out weighs keeping my spots secret!!!! In 5 days out there we only saw 6 other snowmobiles and they were just passing through."
452048,Terry,2010-04-05 14:41:00,14456,wow that's a trip and a half  and very nice fish no matter where you are
452086,Carp,2010-04-05 16:14:00,1488,Some very nice lakers.  Thanks for the report and video.
452349,ctdd2006,2010-04-06 01:18:00,531,"Amazing stuff!  Thanks for adding something to ""the list"".  Love it!  Cheers."
452359,NAW,2010-04-06 01:31:00,4022,That was great man.  Nice job on the video!
