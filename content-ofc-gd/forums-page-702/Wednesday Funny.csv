One day while he was on one of his frequent fishing trips, he got a call that a woman at a neighboring farm was giving birth.  He rushed to her aid and delivered a healthy baby boy.  The farmer had nothing to weigh the baby with so the doctor used his fishing scale.  The baby weighed in at 32 pounds, 10 ounces!"
