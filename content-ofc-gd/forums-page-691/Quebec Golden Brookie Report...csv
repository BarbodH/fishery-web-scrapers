460072,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-26 21:02:00,2038,  We were casting deep into the fallen trees along the shoreline....15' to 20' of water under the trees .   The trout would come up an ABSOLUTELY smash the Black Mepps ..

459684,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-26 00:29:00,2038,"Teamed up with 24/7 and hit a little Lake X up in the mountains in Gods Country..A little cool in the morning hours , but nothing the bright sun couldn't chase away in a hurry...water temp rocked back and forth between 53 and 54 degrees  And it wasn't long before they came out to play...24/7 working the fallen birch trees along the north side shoreline...three minutes on the lake = Bang !!            Clear water and Golden Specks...           Black Mepps was the ticket in the morning and Mini Big-o was the ticket in the afternoon      Later on in the afternoon all living creatures around seemed to be enjoying the sun.                       Only one speck was kept ..(  a bleeder )...All others released to swim another day.."

459912,Fishing 24/7,2010-04-26 15:59:00,709,  that crank is one of the best lure of the lake.  we found that out after most of the specks regurgatated minnows the same color and size.  they must eat 7-8 minnows every 1-2 houres.  they also love salamanders.  can you imagine the size of the lure you need to replicate that bug.  2-3 inches...  so they feed on big things.
459919,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-26 16:12:00,2038,  A River Otter..
