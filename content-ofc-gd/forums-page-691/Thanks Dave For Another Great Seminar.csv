461171,Fish Farmer,2010-04-29 12:50:00,2234,Dave does it again  . I was at the Dofasco Fishing Club meeting last night and Dave Mercer was there speaker. I think this was my 6th. Dave Mercer seminar I've seen and still come out with sore cheeks from laughing  . All the guys setting at our table had a great time. Thanks again Dave for a great entertaining night.
