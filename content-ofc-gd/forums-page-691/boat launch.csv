I'm going there on Saturday and I know it's going to be busy so a place that has parking would be nice.  I don't mind if I have to pay to park and launch.  Thanks"

461562,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-30 13:55:00,2690,Read on the Quinte forum that the boat launch in Trenton is closed due to low water.  Might want to double check.
