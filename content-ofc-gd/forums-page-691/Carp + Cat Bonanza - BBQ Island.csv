But becuase i had the itch and i was being sttuborn even though my friends didn't want to go. And thought that i was stupid for going after cats and carp during what little trout time was left. I went anyway  Well one of my buddies came along but the poor guy just caught one channel cat and one brown bullhead.  I on the other hand landed 4 Carp, 6 Channel Cats, and one bullhead. I was all dressed up cause it got really cold at night (well it was cold for me) i just had a T shirt on underneath the layers, and the wind wasn't helping. Hence the many jackets  The pics aren't all that great but ennnh    Sorry i can't post pics apparently they have to be 250 k  mine are from a 3.2 Mega Pixel, no idea how to shrink the images so if you must see em they are on OOD."

After you install it you can right click on your picture and it will give you several sizes you can use. Click on one and it will make a copy that is smaller for use on the forum. Hope this helps. Get them carpy pictures up there.
