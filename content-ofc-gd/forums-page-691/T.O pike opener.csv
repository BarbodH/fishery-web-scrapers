Judging from a thread about Quinte, i would assume that pike and walleye are open around here as well. Am i right?  Wondering when walleye are open on Pigeon Lake as well. Thanks!"
461222,BucktownAngler,2010-04-29 15:35:00,582,"all of lake ontario, pike/walleye opens this Sat."
461223,Raf,2010-04-29 15:36:00,3495,1st saturday in May for Pike on L. Ontario.  2nd saturday in May for Walleye in Kawarthas - seems odd thought it was 3rd for inland lakes.
461224,BucktownAngler,2010-04-29 15:36:00,582,"pigeon lake, i think 2nd Sat in May...."
461232,ehg,2010-04-29 15:53:00,2666,Thanks for the quick confirmations. I'll plan excursions around these dates.

461310,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-29 18:20:00,3761,"Yup, this Saturday is the day, heading out for the day with GoneFishin this Saturday in search of Pike...jerkbaits, spinnerbaits should be fun tossin baits around again in semi warm water...that bite before the season closed sucked for me. Hope I can turn things around this time haha.  1 more day"
