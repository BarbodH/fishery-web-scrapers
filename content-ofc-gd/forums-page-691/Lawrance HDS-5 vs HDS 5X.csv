I am just wondering if anyone can tell me the differences between the two.  From what I can see, the HDS 5X is missing the GPS....am I correct and is there any other differences?  Or if anyone knwos if the info was posted prior, can you please post a link.  Thanks"

459781,SlowPoke,2010-04-26 09:49:00,2984,Looks like  HDS 7X would be sonar HDS 7M would be chartplotter HDS 7 would be a combo unit
461544,Stoty,2010-04-30 12:34:00,2910,"Yes, you're right the 5x is just a sonar (no GPS). No other differences."
461547,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-30 13:04:00,3761, And sonar = fish finder?
461599,Gerry,2010-04-30 16:29:00,257,And that would be correct.   
461647,Terry,2010-04-30 18:53:00,14456,fishfinder....well I find fish with them some only find the bottom of the lake and for them we call them sonars
