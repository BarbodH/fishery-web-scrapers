In the vicinity were some blue herons, a big Niagara bank beaver, and , for a real treat, a bald eagle. To join me was Rockfish. You just never know what you are going to catch on a Lake O trib and we had a nice mix.     The mix was rounded off by some OOS incidentals and a line peeler that straightened the hook ( some mutant fishzilla? or a big old carp) Had so much fun we stayed til the sun went down."

461394,mbosh1980,2010-04-29 23:15:00,349,nice perch! is the pale colouration seasonal or because of location?
461442,bigugli,2010-04-30 00:52:00,6138,Most fish in muddy waters have a paler colouration. Once they run back out to lake O they will darken. Grand walleyes are always pale.
