461521,Marc Thorpe,2010-04-30 09:15:00,621,"Jat we were running the baits down around 10 to 15 feet,adding weight when the bite was deep and removing the weight as the bite rose.  Roy,that plate looks delicious,even I would want to eat fish  Tybo,I think they mistook my truck for a Chevy actually,got side window hit by a rock twice in the same week,the second one did the damage,weird way  Just got back from fishing not 1 but 2 snow storms,brutal to say the least Looks nice for this weekend,Oh Royyyyyyyyyyyyyy anyway of getting out of push cart Duty"
461523,Roy,2010-04-30 10:08:00,13728,I'm smartening up Marc...did my pushcart stuff last night. Sorry to hear about the white crap for you this week.
461549,Rattletrap2,2010-04-30 13:32:00,1652,"Roy, As if the trout pictures were not good enough, the dinner shot is awesome! Looks like a meal fit for a king!  Good stuff."
459785,Roy,2010-04-26 11:03:00,13728,"Well, Saturday was just a wonderful day. 2010 trout opening was great. Marc Thorpe and I went out scouting lakes in the townships on Easter weekend...we had a few in mind but there were also some lakes that neither of us had fished. I wanted landlocked but they were all going to be a zoo on opening day. Also, it was early enough at Easter that we couldn't predict the weather so we tried for a lake with good protection from the wind. We didn't want a lake with dozens/hundreds of boats either. Dodging the traffic while fishing is just not my style. We were supposed to leave here around 5:30-6:00am but I was online at 3AM and he popped up there too and was ready to go.so everything was ready he just had to pass by my place whenever. We left my place around 4:45.  The score for the day was 4 for 7, not large ones but beautiful fights. Although the fish were all over the water column, the sweet spot seemed to be 32-42 FOW and about 12-15' down. Almost all fish were caught on Savage Gear baits, the ""Prey"" model in natural colours. Using brand new rods from FhishingStuff. The challenge was that it was a brand new lake to both of us and we hadn't much time to figure it out. We kept two eaters just comfortably over the slot.  Here are a few pictures.              Ok,the truth is we didn't have much figuring to do....all we had to do was fish near here:    I hope you all had a great time!  added:  "
459786,Spiel,2010-04-26 11:08:00,9065,"Well done my friend. Good company, good weather and some nice looking trout, perfect day."
