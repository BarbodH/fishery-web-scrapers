461338,Great Lake Steel,2010-04-29 19:27:00,41," Work kept me from getting out much this week, but that's one pool I'll avoid then. I'd rather walk 10km's and catch one fish without the crowds than stand in a pool like that and catch 25.  Thanks for the info, and please pass my compliments along to you and your friends. It was nice of you to help teach the kids beside you too."

461308,Great Lake Steel,2010-04-29 18:01:00,41,"From the pictures I realize that I ran into your group Sunday evening.  What did you think about that gong show?  Kudos to your friend with the fur lined hat, he's some fisherman. Leading the fish he was fighting downriver to clear the pool was classy, grabbing that kids fish and reviving it for him even classier.  I didn't even want to get involved in that mess and just watched for a while."
461316,l2p,2010-04-29 18:34:00,346,"cant say much about the circus, i mean theres not really much u can do about them. like it or not their guna be there hahah, that pool was given its name for a reason. just cant belive that the fish stayed active the whole time. we went back monday and was pretty much the same thing exept when the cold front moved in, then they finally shut down."
461320,Great Lake Steel,2010-04-29 18:49:00,41," I hear you, you guys were definately outnumbered.  Was she as crowded on Monday as Sunday? I live up the river and just happened to walk down that far. It was the only fishable pool (holding fish) I saw all day."
461324,l2p,2010-04-29 19:04:00,346,yeah it was just as busy if not more... go figure. we evenn stayed after the sun went down to see if the crowds would die down.. they did then next thing u know theres 15 glow sticks floating the pool... lol what can ya do its almost tradition at that pool.
