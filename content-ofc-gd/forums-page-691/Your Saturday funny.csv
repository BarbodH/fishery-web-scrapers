The Manager says, 'Do you have any sales  experience?'  The kid says, 'Yeah.  I was a  salesman back in Saskatchewan.'  Well,  the boss liked the kid and gave him the job. 'You start  tomorrow.  I'll come down after we close and see how you  did.'  His first day on the job was rough, but he got  through it.  After the  store  was locked up, the boss came down. 'How many  customers bought something from you today?'  The kid  says 'one'.  The boss says, 'Just one? Our  salespeople average 20 to  30  customers a day.  How much was the sale for?'  The  kid says, '$101,237.65.'  The boss says, '$101,237.65!   What the heck did you sell?'  The kid says,  'First, I sold him a small fishhook.   Then  I sold him a medium fishhook.  Then  I sold him a larger fishhook.  Then  I sold him a new fishing rod.  Then  I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down the  coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we  went down to the boat department and I sold him a twin  engine Chris Craft.  Then he said he  didn't  think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I  took him down to the automotive department and sold him  that 4x4 Ford Expedition.'  The boss said, 'You mean to  tell me that a guy came in here to buy a fish hook and  you sold him a BOAT and a TRUCK?'  The Saskatchewan farm boy said,  'No, the guy came in here to buy Tampons for his wife and  I said, 'Dude, your weekend's shot -- you  should go fishing!' "

Before working at that store he worked in a drug store back in Saskatchewan, and an elderly customer came in one day complaining of a bad cough. They were an exceptionally small store in an exceptionally small town and had run out of their meager supply, so the manager offered to drive to a larger town and procure some. When he returned he asked the lad where the customer had gone. ""Oh, I fixed him up boss, he said he couldn't wait so I sold him an ex-lax chocolate bar."" The manager looked puzzled and said ""ex-lax isn't meant for coughs!"" The kid smiled and replied ""Well I made him eat the whole bar boss, now take a look at him. He's over the road there hanging on to that lamp post and he's too afraid to cough!"""
