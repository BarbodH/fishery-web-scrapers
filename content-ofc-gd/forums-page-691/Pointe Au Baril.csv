461740,yakpiker,2010-05-01 00:38:00,160,"Had some success with pike up there hitting Rapala husky jerks...a lot of guests commented on catching with these.  Water temperature was the key factor in terms of where to fish and how fast to retrieve.  If it's under 70F then head for the shallow bays and look for weeds.  If it's over 70F then stay in water between 6 and 10 feet deep.  For pickeral, did ok with jigs and twister tails...cast them out in the river and let them sink to bottom before reeling them in slowly.  May not be a pro tip, but it worked for me. Good luck."
