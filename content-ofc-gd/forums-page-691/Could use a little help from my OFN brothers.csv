The ice fishing video I made when my buddy Terry came up last month is currently doing well in a video contest it is entered in but I could use a few more hits before the contest ends on Friday. So if you could see your way clear to visit and have a look, it would be much appreciated.  http://www.trophy-clips.com/view_video.php?viewkey=3a2b5af89203c2b78c67"
