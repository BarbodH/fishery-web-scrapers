461707,Muskieman,2010-04-30 22:29:00,2472,"How an Economic Stimulus package works...   It is a slow day in the small Northern Ontario town of Sturgeon Falls , and streets are deserted. Times are tough, everybody is in debt, and everybody is living on credit.  A rich tourist visiting the area drives through town, stops at a local fishing lodge, and lays a $100 bill on the desk saying he wants to inspect the cabins on the Sturgeon River to pick one for the night.  As soon as he walks from cabin to cabin, the lodge owner grabs the bill and runs next door to pay his debt to the butcher.  The butcher takes the $100 and runs down the street to retire his debt to the cow farmer.  The cow farmer takes the $100 and heads off to pay his bill to his supplier, the Farmer's Co-op.  The guy at the Farmer's Co-op takes the $100 and runs to pay his debt to the local prostitute.    The prostitute, who has also been facing hard times, has had to offer her ""services"" on credit.  She rushes to the fishin'lodge on the Sturgeon River  and pays off her cabin bill with the lodge owner.  The lodge proprietor then places the $100 back on the counter so the rich traveler will not suspect anything.  At that moment, the traveler comes down the stairs, states that the cabins are not satisfactory, picks up the $100 bill, and leaves town.  No one produced anything. No one earned anything...However, the whole town is now out of debt and now looks to the future with a lot more optimism.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how a stimulus package works.   RFS "
