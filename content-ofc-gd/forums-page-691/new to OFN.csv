461813,wormdunker,2010-05-01 10:01:00,1711,Welcome Pike guy.  I had the great opportunity to work in Sudbury last summer for 3 months.  I worked for All Purpose Crane Rental (I'm a crane operator).  Great bunch of guys.  Although I've never fished Ramsay I fished lots of the smalls lakes near the Watershed truck stop every week end.  U folks have an excellent fishery just north of Sudbury.  Today I'm targetting perch on Lake Erie!!  WOO HOO!!

461419,pikeguy,2010-04-30 00:10:00,195,Hi every one. I live in Sudbury and enjoy fishing allot. I spend most of the time fishing on nipissing and on Ramsey  lake. I fish mostly for bass pike and perch occasionally i head out to Mcgregor bay for rainbow trout. I enjoy the great out doors and spend as much time as i can out there. If anybody has any interesting places for me to check out let me know

Sturgeon Falls is almost half way. We definately should arrange something for local board members in the Sturgeon Falls area this summer. I have a trailer at Glenrock on Nipissing. Maybe T.J. will all have us up to his palace a.k.a. Camp Jiggy. lol

461811,Handlebarz,2010-05-01 09:38:00,3790,Welcome aboard PikeGuy do you hit Ramsey after may 24 weekend? When I lived there i would be out there daily at moonlight beach pounding the eye's I was wondering how the fishing there was and how the pike fishing is around bald rock or the bay to the right just after you leave moonlight beach we fished that area alot and got some really nice fish from there.  I see your on Nipp do you do any musky fishing? if so there is a local chapter of Muskies Canada with a great bunch of guys they meet at the Falcon down stairs if yer interested.  Cheers Mike
