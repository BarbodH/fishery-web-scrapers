461585,Carp,2010-04-30 15:21:00,1488,Very good of you to try and locate the owner T Fisher.  
461587,GBW,2010-04-30 15:29:00,8460,"Good on ya for trying to find the person. I hope the ""fishing God's"" return the favour to you."
461591,The JAY,2010-04-30 15:56:00,239,It's been said that angling is a Gentlemans passtime.. You're proving that. Cheers!
461600,blaque,2010-04-30 16:30:00,2419,"Did you check the port-0'-potty..........they may have just been tending to an ""emergency""    lol"
461615,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-30 17:08:00,0,I think Chris Hiltz should be commended for returning the equipment Tom.
461688,Dara,2010-04-30 20:49:00,3052,The sad part is you couldn't even leave it at the nearest store or bait shop and expect the owner to get it back.  Maybe post a note somewhere in the area
461692,ctdd2006,2010-04-30 21:13:00,531,good on ya!   PB's are sure to come your way!  Cheers.
461693,Big Cliff,2010-04-30 21:13:00,6899, I think he just did!
461737,bigbuck,2010-05-01 00:34:00,2449,Good on you!!! Too many people would just grab everything and RUN! The fishing gods will smile on you and you can look at yourself in the mirror and say you did something good for someone you don't even know. The guy that grabs and runs needs to look over his shoulder when he looks in the mirror.
461788,T Fisher,2010-05-01 02:59:00,139,Hey GB maybe you should ask B-4 you post a remark. Chris and I were fishing together the founder was me not Chris. I told him to post the find on the other board and I would post on this board.  PM SENT.
