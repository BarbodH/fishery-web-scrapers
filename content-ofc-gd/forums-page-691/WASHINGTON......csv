461269,jedimaster,2010-04-29 16:57:00,3472,"Well I don't mean to start a hornets nest here but, the call on the goal that called back was pretty bogus. He got pushed into Halak by Gill. But none the less they had a whole game to score 2 goals. Halak, won that series for them hands down. Best playoff perfomance for a very long time by a goalie. I hate the Habs, but I need ot root for them now since they work out best for my hockey pool.....err uuuu Go Habs Go....... CRINGE shudder....with shivers up my back.   And the reson Gill isn't being talked about is because if they didn't call that goal back Gill would have been booed out of town for pushing the washington guy into Halak and causing them the series. He played solid but man oh man I bet he was shitting in his skates for a few seconds til they called the goal back."

461300,LipDip,2010-04-29 17:51:00,39,"  'Crosby doesn't battle like Ovechkin,' 'I'd take him over Crosby.' lol I may have a television with cable you can borrow guys lol.  I judge players like lures. Some are flashy and produce nothing, or only produce alongside everything else. Others are reliable and will catch fish when it's tough and have a production record. I ask again....how is Ovechkin any different than any other skilled euro past or present who can't lead and has piled up stats while never even winning on a Nevada Ticket? If you like hotdogging, soundbites, goofy antics and a real penchant for predatory play, Ovechkin is your man. Very quietly Backtrom and Semin appear every bit as deadly as Ovechkin. Both are equally effective. Look what Fetisov, Fedorov etc accomplished while playing like adults. Ovechkin needs to win something or lead a team and worry less about being a goof.  Ovechkin=Poor Man's Bure. Headed north, you boys have fun!"
461307,tb4me,2010-04-29 17:58:00,3295,well written! couldnt have said it any better myself..Im north too baby!! going to fish the mouth of the oxtongue river in the lake of bays for a couple o days!

461332,Slop,2010-04-29 19:24:00,151,Halak in six this round.
461335,anders,2010-04-29 19:25:00,1168,For all you Caps fans...there is a new History will be made commercial up on nhl.com right now featuring Halak.  hahah
461350,jedimaster,2010-04-29 20:05:00,3472,"I would take Ovechkin over crosby any day of the week. but ove wouldn't be the captain. He would be the number one left winger. He is a goal scoring freak. He needs a mentor, like Federov had in Yzerman and Linden of Bure, before the florida co captain thingy with Paul Laus. The flashy goal scoring russian freaks need a solid North american style player to show them the ropes for a while and keep them in check before they become a better well rounded player. At there current ages and skill sets, I would take ove over crosby. But to be honest with you ANY team would take either one over ANY of the player on there teams. They are hands down the two brightest most tallented players in the league right now. but yah the caps sure choke on that 3-1 lead. man o man my pool is effed up now. I gotta hope for a Boston or Montreal cup win to even have a chance."

461356,tb4me,2010-04-29 20:37:00,3295,"Just ask Washington what happens when you count on just one player to win the games. Montreal has a ""D"" but their small up front..Should be interesting to see the next series. I personally take the pens in 5.They have a good solid team.No individual players all about teamwork."

461385,fish_fishburn,2010-04-29 22:47:00,1311,The caps might of scored only one or two goals while on the pp in the whole series.  Thats dismal.
461396,kickingfrog,2010-04-29 23:18:00,8333," 1 for 33 (1%) to be exact. They had the highest percent success rate during the regular season at about 25%, I think the next closest team was the toilets seats at around 21%.  I think we know why Team Canada may have decided why not to take Green over Doughty for the Olympic team."
461403,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-04-29 23:23:00,0,"I have to agree with Jedi. Washington got robbed on that goal and I think Halak took a dive after he KNEW it went in. The puck went in well before the alleged interference.I was telling my brother, if Halak stays sharp they will win, but if they break Halak early, they will open him up. The goal called back breathed more life into him.  Hal Gill played amazing and I was not happy when I heard they traded him. I was one of the guys that wanted Gill to come to Toronto in the first place.  In game 6? Even though I am a leaf fan, I really wanted Montreal to win. I told my brother that Washington has the skill but Montreal has the heart and is more hungry. Halak looked strong in game 6. I didn't see Halak's pre-season games but was very impressed with Halak in the winter Olympics. Solid goaltender.  The truth of the mater is Washington outplayed Montreal(But their power play sucked big time). The shots on goal tell it all. Montreal was just hungrier, blocking shots, aggressive fore checking, and of course Halak standing on his head. ect...  Washington can't be blamed. Montreal played a good game. But Washington might be looking to bulk up next season.  This playoffs is going to have some amazing hockey games!"
461428,Dondorfish,2010-04-30 00:29:00,1000,  I believe it was 1 for 34 - counting the one in the last 2 minutes of the game.  Don
461459,Daplumma,2010-04-30 01:27:00,1961,"Our power play was pathetic,we played without heart.Our guys were doggong it and expecting the puck to bounce our way.I feel bad for OV,Backstrom,Carlson.Chimera and a few others that gave the 100%.The rest thought it was there cup to lose...They lost it!The team is still very young and will be a force for years to come,thank you Ted.I could pick apart the referee bad calls and the bad luck but the bottom line is this series shhould not have even been close enough for a few bad calls to make a difference.We played poorly and the Canadiens wanted it more.Very humbleing and now I have no hockey to watch until fall.Best of luck to whoever wins this thing,I think the best team has been eliminated and educated.

461535,JohnAB,2010-04-30 11:29:00,178,"Excuses for a team with no heart. Bad referee calls both ways. Always a joy when Ovie loses. Last year when Washington was up 2-0 on Pittsburgh, Ovie singing on the bench with the fans in Washington, Pittsburgh sucks. Was so nice when Pittsburgh took them out. Now my Habs have taken them out which makes my season. And agree, it is very apparent why Green was not on Team Canada. Comes to the big games and where is he? Something like 12 games in the playoffs now with out a goal.  As they say, goaltending and defence win in the playoffs, Washington has neither."

461109,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-29 02:48:00,0,Novechkin strikes again! May the Crosby vs. Ovechkin debate rage on! One has won every accolade available and the other has yellow laces.
461140,ADB,2010-04-29 05:06:00,444, My sentiments exactly.
461161,LipDip,2010-04-29 12:07:00,39," The nice thing about Roethlisberger is that despite being 260 with a face-tan, he still genuinely believes he's a hockey player. His hockey hair is off the hook.  Crosby? Says very little, bigger the game, better he plays. Already decorated professionally and internationally. No sound bites, no limelight. A playmaker and his team mates love him. Probably the best ambassador in any sport since Gretzky in my mind. Funny, they're both humble, small town guys. You could not pick a better guy to lead a group. It's all action, and a resume of production.  Ovechkin? Bigger the game, less of a factor he is. Walk right down the line with this one. World Jrs, Olympics (there's still a Search Warrant out on him), Stanley Cup Playoffs. Not a leader. Even guys on his own team shake their heads at him. It's been documented. At his best in 11-2 games in Decemeber when there's zero on the line. A glorified Pavel Bure if you ask me. The way Ovechkin picks his spots physically is another thread altogether. I think as his act wears thinner and thinner with all that talent and zero results, he just may get his clock cleaned, Evene in today's pansi-friendly league. Yzerman, Coffey, Gretzky, Lemieux, Orr, these guys all ""loved to make score goals"" just as much as you do. The only difference is they acted like men when they did it. And am I the only one who thinks Ovechkin could be a stunt double for one of the cavemen on the Geico commercials? Crosby may look like he's wearing lipstick a lot of the time, but the shape of Ovechkin's skull and forehead along with his bert 'n Ernie cut really does make him look like Austropolithicus.  I think the tale of the tape in the results department will be so lopsided in Crosby's favour ten years from now that it will be a joke we ever compared the two."
461165,Grimace,2010-04-29 12:25:00,2020,"So LipDip, I guess we will mark you down as undecided then?   Lol."
461166,fish_fishburn,2010-04-29 12:27:00,1311,The shape of someones skull or haircut doesn't make a hockey player. Thats just stupid to even comment on that. The difference is Crosby leads by example and is a humble person. His team  mates would follow him off of a cliff. Ovi hasn't figured out there is no (I) in the word team and seems to be more interested with his personnal goals and achievements.
461178,JohnF,2010-04-29 13:03:00,3494," Probably the biggest factor, but I don't think I've ever seen Hal Gill come thru like that for a sustained period. He was a rock on defence. And Gomez (and a few others) maintained the energy level to keep the speed up there. Mebbe speed only works for Ovy when he's the only speedster in the mix. He got poke checked more than I've ever seen before. In fact, Montreal back checked as well as any team I've seen in a while. When a Caps player would try to skate thru neutral ice with the puck as often as not it seemed a Hab would just catch him, lift his stick and take the puck. It was sure fun to watch.  Now the next big question, can the Habs keep that energy level thru another fast series. I can't be any more surprised if they do but I'm not betting on them getting out of this next series. As much as it pains me to say it, those Habs put on one of the gutsiest performances I've seen in a long time and I've become a temporary fan for the rest of the playoffs. Naturally I'll be back in Blue when preseason starts again, and cheering for whichever of their platoons of goalies and d-men appears.  I kinda felt sorry for Price at the end. It would have been nice if he could have had a little piece of the victory after all the abuse he's had thrown at him by the fans. From what I've seen of Habs fans over the years (only on tv) they're the most hypocritical pricks in the hockey fan world. All the love in the world for their team when they win but watch them turn on them if they're down 0-3 in the next round. While the rest of the hockey world will still be raving about the great job done by the Habs against the Caps their own fans will be booing them (even Halak) for not walking all over Sid and the Pens. Am I being too hard on Habby fans?  Is anyone betting against Subban to be a regular next year?  JF"
461179,kickingfrog,2010-04-29 13:07:00,8333,"I do think Crosby is a better all-round hockey player than Ovechkin.  We are only 5 years into this comparison that will last for the next 50 years and both players have 12-15 seasons still to play. That said Ovie is very entertaining to watch, maybe more than Crosby.  My first instinct is to not like ovie (that's growing-up with the Iron curtain for you I guess). Ovechkin loves to play hockey. Much of the time he acts like the biggest kid in the world, and I find that refreshing. The down side is that, like a kid, he wants to stay out on the ice all the time. Hockey shifts of over a minute are not the most efficient use of a human's energy systems. No amount of training, or genetics, can overcome that fact.  If Ovechkin were to take shorter, but more frequent, shifts he would have a similar amount of total ice time but the quality of his shifts would go up dramatically. That's scary when you think what he has been able to do up to this point doing his way."
461181,Lunker Larry,2010-04-29 13:14:00,122,Any bets there won't be a coaching change in Washington next year? He can get them to the playoffs but not past he first round.....!

Maybe they were not great golfers so the leaf guys didnt want them bringing their golf games down . How many more EX leafs will be enjoying the play offs, Rask etc. sad sad"
461246,Dutchy,2010-04-29 16:21:00,416," The guy shining up his Stanley Cup ring from last year.  :clapping:  He played very very well for Pittsburgh last year in the run to the cup, very underrated. He did play really well for the habs in this series as well.  Ovechkin is somewhat predictable. When he comes in and a blocker steps in his way, he shoots anyway. Crosby and Malkin typically pass the puck off instead even just to keep possession. This will be a very different series for the Habs."
461250,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-29 16:29:00,4399,"Gill played real well and he did the same for Pittsburgh last year in there run to cup. Loved the way Josh Gorges played, not bad for a throw in player in the Rivet deal, if I had a vote in who the next captain should be he would be my choice."
461251,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-29 16:31:00,4399," I agree it will be a different series for the Habs,this one we win in six not seven!!!"
461255,walleyejigger,2010-04-29 16:40:00,876,"Not just Washington, but the top 3 seeds in the east.... buh bye la.  I think it was a big mistake by washington to leave varlamov in there, they should of went back with theo, mtl put in price after an ify halak but went back with him, you have to believe in ur players, theodore was their man for the playoffs, a bad game and they dump him, big mistake in my eyes, varlamov was hardly a descent goalie in this series  GO HABS GO"
461259,canadadude,2010-04-29 16:44:00,769,"Ovechkin hits, checks and grinds out on the ice, Crosby dosn't battle like Ovi and they were pretty equal in stats this year only because Crosby played 15 or more games. The one thing I do like about Syd the kid is he's finnally stopped crying about every check.They didn't need a Zamboni in Pittsburg for the previous 4 yrs they just flooded the ice with Crosby's tears hahahahaha.Anyway both those dudes better move over soon, Stamkos will be taking over.  If the habs can shut down the most powerfull offence in the league they should be able to take out Pittsburg. Watch out for Detroit, the best team since the Olympic break is beginning to roll and they like winning Stanley Cups"
