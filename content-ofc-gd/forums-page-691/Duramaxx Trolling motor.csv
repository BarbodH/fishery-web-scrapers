461429,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-30 00:30:00,2690,Anyone????
461435,tb4me,2010-04-30 00:43:00,3295,bow or transom mount? 38lb may be a tad weak but you cant go wrong for 100 bucks..
461438,danbouck,2010-04-30 00:48:00,4380,"38 will do fine for that boat, Can't go wrong for that price"
461451,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-30 01:10:00,2690,"Transom mount.  I figured the same thing, for a $100 what the heck...can always upgrade in a couple years, but, was hoping to hear from somebody who has one possibly. Thanks!"
461455,Blue Lk,2010-04-30 01:17:00,337,"I bought 1 2 yrs ago on sale at ctc,use it lots on my 10ft jonboat,no issues,works good 4 the $."
461469,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-30 01:42:00,3761,Go for it...my 30lb Kota moves my 12' fine...a 38 should be good for a 14' bud...I would love to see somebody get 2 and put them on their transom...run them both lol...only in the south i guess lol.
461485,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-30 02:05:00,1107,"just go buy a bowmount if ya can .you will eventually anyways, unless you will have another use for it. I think I paid $399 for my 40lb minnkota bowmount and I think the price has come down a bit since then. prolly find a good 1 used for $300 but for $100 it will do the job but they can be a pain on the transom."
461526,scugpg,2010-04-30 10:22:00,1373, Much easier to pull than push the boat in the wind. If you can afford it consider a bowmount.  If your boat has some weight to it I'd consider something bigger like a 50lb.
461528,danbouck,2010-04-30 11:02:00,4380, I had a 45 and 30 going on my tinny at the same time
461530,Roy,2010-04-30 11:08:00,13728, Must be a hoot to steer eh?
461533,danbouck,2010-04-30 11:26:00,4380, Arm resting on one and holding on to the other. Actually wasn't too hard to steer.
461534,TC1OZ,2010-04-30 11:29:00,987,"Humm new with a year warranty, can't go wrong."
461546,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-30 12:44:00,2690,"Thanks, guys....I grabbed one first thing this morning at the CT around the corner from where I work...only one in stock (go figure!!!!!!!!!)....has a two year warranty and a spare prop.  Should suffice for what I want it for...basically just puttering around near shorelines.  My 15 hp Merc trolls fine."
461548,TC1OZ,2010-04-30 13:06:00,987, I'm going to check my local CTC when I get off work today.
461557,hirk,2010-04-30 13:44:00,571,"Take the head off and spin it 180*,this will allow you to go backward (pull instead of push the boat for better control) with all your forward speed options."
461595,The Urban Fisherman,2010-04-30 16:09:00,2050," yeah if you do this you can mount it on the front of your boat and putt along just like any other bow-mount.  Obviously not as easy without foot control, but much better for pounding the shoreline than having it mounted on the transom.  Enjoy your motor!"
