444064,ehg,2010-03-15 19:18:00,2666,Good or bad?   Good
444068,Eazy,2010-03-15 19:32:00,260,"Hah!...........I was goona say, that's pretty in-depth!"
444069,Eazy,2010-03-15 19:37:00,260,"I said something along the same lines........She still din't seem to understand tho!......Remember, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than understanding!....How much was that four-wheeler?"
444121,smitter,2010-03-15 21:37:00,106,"Fishing is not an addiction, trips to the tackle store can be though.  And that's an addiction I've got bad!  :D"

443481,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-13 21:26:00,0,Like any addiction. Ya gotta learn how to hide it...

443488,vinnimon,2010-03-13 21:46:00,2593,"I know that all too well  I always get the,   ""When did you get that and how much did it cost""Question all of the time. I always reply I traded some flies and an old rod for it and some beer money as well.What a steal, its worth a fortune. Yes it is an addiction, but a good one indeed."

443490,vinnimon,2010-03-13 21:57:00,2593,Wouldnt that be considered eccentric in some manner.And a trip to the cocanut house in someones latter years?
443498,Sinker,2010-03-13 22:30:00,8692,I wish it was just an addiction!!! Its soooo much more than that!!
443504,OhioFisherman,2010-03-13 22:44:00,6623,"Sit on your butt behind a game console, or at a bar, or out in the fresh air and sunshine? or rain, lol to each his or her own? Addiction? no, a state of mind."
443524,backbay,2010-03-13 23:39:00,773,"My girlfriend says it's bad. Very bad. Me, I could quit if I wanted to........."
443540,brkygetr,2010-03-14 00:29:00,425,The reality of the situation is it is not that easy in todays society to introduce youth to the bounty of nature. It takes time and patience to enjoy and understand either fishing or hunting and the gratification it can provide...Unless you live or are raised in an area of the province that is still rooted by trees and rock.  I really wish i could show my nephews what it means to 'get away' but unfortunaetly they just want instant action and results.....both of which are easily attained via a game console. 2 days in a boat and tent would just be too trying. It is sad and painfull but I beleive that is truely the case. As far as addiction is concerned I beleive we all know the answer to that.

443574,Mykester,2010-03-14 01:34:00,241," Born and raised in Toronto, hooked (lol) since I was 4. But I see your point."
443605,Whitespinnerbait,2010-03-14 02:39:00,2038,Fishing is not an addiction... its a Passion..........
443619,shadowfly,2010-03-14 03:30:00,84,"no addiction here , just the love for being away from the daily routine away from it all. my ex girlfriend used to say I'm addicted to fishing . in a heated argument one day she gave me the option sell all my gear , rods and reels and get married and do more ""FAMILY ACTIVITIES ""  or she will go her way  well Told her gonna miss her , my last words to the poor women wore a lie since i don't miss her at all."
443636,cityfisher,2010-03-14 05:15:00,959,"It's a lifestyle , it's part of me, what I enjoy to do, where I enjoy to be, outdoors:)  my wife accepted that , so far atleast"
443638,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-14 07:09:00,158,"  LOL, Good on ya mate. I have been offered the ultimatium myslef before in more indirect terms.  Why on earth do some women think they can change a man.  And why oh why would they want to snuff out our greatest passion.  So they can have a shell of a man mope around the house? Just beyond me.  It stopped being an addiction for me years ago.  Its my life now, they day i stop fishin' is the day I die."
443649,Marc Thorpe,2010-03-14 11:02:00,621,Its only an addiction if your trying to quit
443650,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-14 11:40:00,1362,My wife brings this topic up at least once a week....she's my best friend so I talk a lot about fishing to her....something I'm trying to control a bit more now I keep telling her it could be a lot worse....I could be at the peeler bar every other day talking fishing to strange women
443655,laszlo,2010-03-14 12:45:00,487,"being outside is my addiction. whatever the means...fishing, hiking, running, biking, gardening, basketball, walking my dog, frisbee, swimming, eating on a patio, and on and on and on and on..............."
