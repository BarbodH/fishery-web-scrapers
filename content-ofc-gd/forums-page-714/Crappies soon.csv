443460,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-13 20:11:00,2050," I don't use jigs at all.  Although I'm usually targetting gills, with crappie catches being incidentals.  Here's a pasted report I did last year on some ice out panfish techniques...   Cheers, Ryan   Hit the reservoir one last time this morning, and decided to do a more in depth report than ""went out with the kid and smashed them""  So, as most of you have seen, these past few weekends I've taken my daughter out to fish early season Panfish from shore.  I've been landlocked seeing as our second child is due anytime.  Anyways, the panfish trips, albeit from shore, are a nice way to get into the swing of things, and to get some good eatin' fish early on in the season.  This fishing is probably one of the easiest ways to get kids into the sport, but can also be a ton of fun for the seasoned angler as well.  It's not all dew worms and red bobbers.      Quick and simple, look for warm water, with submerged cover, that has easy access to deeper water and you should find fish.  Creek mouths, with early growth vegetation and submersed brush or fallen tree's are good places to start as well.  Don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for beaver huts, as they've been very productive for us this season.  The crappie will be looking to start their spawn, and although bluegill don't spawn until a little later in the season, they'll be holding in similar areas.  And hey, you may even catch the odd bonus fish, like Averie's first encounter with a rainbow trout.    Technique #1:  One of the best ways to quickly find these tasty, and feisty little fish, is to cast or slowly troll micro crank baits.  Most people prefer tiny spinner baits, but I just find that cranks have out-performed spinners for me in the past, and tend to get more hook-ups.   Well today, one of my first casts out, I snag a tree, and lose the only micro crank I packed.  If I was in my boat I could just head on over and get my bait back, but oh well.  In the past I've used Mini Rapapla's, as well as BPS brand micro cranks.    Dumbass Tip #1: Always pack more than one crankbait, even when you're hauling everything in by foot....even with a 2 year old on your shoulders.   So much for plan ""A"".    When the fish are on, there's no better way to catch Them.  Also, the plus side of crankbait fishing for panfish, is it's a big fish technique.  You spend more time fishing for keepers, and less time taking tiny fish off your line.  Which brings me to technique #2.  The good old Berkley Powerbait pink trout worm under a slip float.    This bait is hard to beat for spring panfish, the only down-side is you better be willing to weed out the small ones.  After about an hour of fishing I must have caught 50+ fish and only had 4 keepers.  As soon as your bait hits the water the little 3""ers  hammer it.    If you're out to get your kids into fishing, this is the way to do it, but if you're out to bring home some eaters, you better have patience.  We forgot our pliers this morning, which was BRUTAL.  Try getting a #10 or so hook out of a 3"" sunfish's mouth.  Not an easy feat.  So Dumbass tip #2: always bring your needle nose pliers.    Once the kids are satisfied that they've caught enough fish themselves, and are busy playing with the fish you've put into a livewell, or cooler filled with water, you can go back to fishing a crankbait, or throwing some larger soft plastics.  Technique #3:  Something I stumbled upon this year was wacky rigging tiny senko type worms.    Fishing them weightless, with NO FLOAT gives you one major advantage, you're always going to end up in the strike zone at some point during the cast.  With spring gills and especially crappie, If you're bait isn't at the right depth, they often won't hit.  It might be just under the fish, or a little to high to bring them up.  With this rig, you just toss it out and let it slowly sink to the bottom.  This way, no matter what the magical depth is, your bait will eventually be in their strike zone.  When you're float fishing you have to constantly move your bobber stop.  Maybe you set it to shallow, then to deep the next cast.  With this set up, if there's fish in the area, you're going to get a bite.  Another advantage is that, because you're using a bigger bait, with a bigger hook, you tend to zero in on the bigger fish.        Anyways, we've taken home a few dozen panfish over the course of the last few weeks, learned a few things and made some solid memories.    So do yourself a favor and take a kid out panfishing this season, I guarantee you'll have a lot of fun, and you might just find a new early season species to target.  That wraps up my ""haresting"" for the season.  I'm having a baby (hopefully soon or my wife is going to snap) and once that settles it'll be pike action on the bay until bass opener.  I know this stuff is all pretty run of the mill info for most of you guys, but my intention is to help out some of the younger, or less experienced members of the board.  Or maybe even to get some of you guys to try something new.  As usual, have fun, and be safe.  Cheers, UF"
443465,frozen-fire,2010-03-13 20:25:00,542,Excellent advice Ryan!  Time to put away the ice gear and dust off the ice out crappie and steelhead stuff!
443552,Beans,2010-03-14 00:50:00,3339,"  Tony has been there and done that...you couldn't find any of his ""specials"" for love nor money...  The manufacturer reneged and started making them again..."
443555,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-03-14 00:53:00,160,cant wait!!!!!!!! i use tubes under a float as well works amazing.
443609,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-14 02:51:00,2582,Yep and I have a bag or 2....but I can't buy a fish on them. The man has the touch...that's all I can say.Some fishermen catch fish cause they put in the time....that's me.  Some catch fish cause they just know. Buckster is in that group.  PS Tony...I love you like a brother...but I hate you too...lol.
443611,buckster,2010-03-14 02:59:00,530,   The feeling is mutal when you take me to your perch hole! lol
443708,Beans,2010-03-14 15:33:00,3339," I know that feeling first hand Tony...  The ratio is about CPH 5 : Beans 1...  Sound about right to you ???  Come to think of it, Cph usually beats me in the carp department also..."
443867,Whitespinnerbait,2010-03-15 00:28:00,2038,    Might even give it a try this year myself...
444061,ehg,2010-03-15 19:10:00,2666,Kept 35 crappie once from a Kawarthas lake a couple of years ago. It was a lot of work cleaning them but worth it. Thirty per person seems sufficient.  I saw you Beans in that spot that day.
442883,gil,2010-03-12 12:58:00,41,"With ice out happening as we speak, it won't be long before the crappies start hitting!  I use a lot of tube jigs under a slip float ,in a lot of different colors. One of my faves is a #10 RATSO in chartruse it's a killer. I rarely use live bait.     What's your go to bait or lure for these tasty critters!  Heres hoping for some real CRAPPIE weather soon."
442889,homie66,2010-03-12 13:11:00,3,"I was up at Lake Seymour yesterday the ice is almost gone.  I imagine with the rain and warm temps this weekend there won't be anything left by Tuesday.  I use the same setup, a 1/32 oz jig head with a 1.5"" micro tube (white with blue, black, and gold flecks).  It was pretty successfull on Seymour and Pigeon last summer.  I tried 4lb mono and fluoro, but didn't really notice a difference in the number of hits.  I'm gonna stick with mono this year."
442895,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-12 13:45:00,2050,"I have yet to catch decent numbers of ice out Crappie.  So far I've got the big bluegill dialed in, but the big schools of crappie have evaded me.  I have had some great success catching them on micro crank baits in late summer and early fall.  Late in the season I find they tend to group up on  the larger weed clumps that are still around once the cover starts dying off.  They're easy targets, and are feeding heavy before they start their annoying suspending winter patterns.  Cheers, Ryan"
442942,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-12 15:42:00,2582," Get some Fin S Shads.... 1.5 inch size.... made by lunker city. Ice shad or arkansas shiner color, or find your own color that works well in your area. Your tubes will pretty much collect dust after you try these baits. I have never used live bait for crappie. And I have not used a tube for 6-7 years at least.  Bring on the spring crappie !!!"
442947,skeeter,2010-03-12 15:52:00,1907,"i use the small twister tails , micro tubes and micro jigs with a piece of worm on it."
442950,Harrison,2010-03-12 15:58:00,2202,"Steelhead maribous, eggsucking leaches and wollybuggers but don't tell anyone.  FinS... umm hmm.   Good call."
442977,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-03-12 17:09:00,1107, Hey Ryan in a week or 2 I will get ya into some ice out crappy there not big slabs but they are perfect eating size I know a small lake that's loaded with them last spring I caught more than I could count I a couple hours I will give ya a call when I get the boat ready to go.
442980,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-12 17:20:00,2050," Sounds like a man-date to me buddy!    I'm in!  Cheers, Ryan"
442981,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-03-12 17:23:00,1107, Easy on the bromance talk there big guy LOL.
443170,Beans,2010-03-13 01:41:00,3339,Remember to check the new regulations for different areas...lots of changes to daily limits...30 only in zone 17 (Kawarthas)
443172,BillM,2010-03-13 01:43:00,17367,I am going to give ice out crappie a go this year for sure.
443174,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-13 01:51:00,2050," Good Point Beans...  I still thing 30 per person is a little high anyways! haha  I took home 12 big bluegill, combined them with fries and salad and fed 6 adults...  Then I was able to go out and catch some more the next weekend!  Just my opinion though...  Cheers, Ryan"
443265,EC1,2010-03-13 09:11:00,930,"Ah Urban, I guess not everyone is able to catch the limit even with that, and then you have people like me that would like more than 1 feed after a trip.  My ideal would be to have about 5 meals from 1 fishing trip every once in a while. And the rest of the trips could be 1 or 2 meals. I guess I just like to eat crappie a lot.  I'm actually cool with the 30. I'm pretty happy they took out the no limit. What is the number you have in mind?  What does everyone else think?"
443297,bassman87,2010-03-13 13:12:00,586,I thought they wanted the carppies out of the Kawarthas? I thought I heard that somewhere.
443309,Beans,2010-03-13 13:49:00,3339," Nasty rumor started by pickerel fishermen...  Crappie are here to stay in the Kawarthas...  Ryan reminded me of the first time I targeted crappie up here with Lew and Meely (yep...you heard right...Lew)...We wanted some to have with our lunch and all we were catching that morning was bull bluegills...  I suggested we keep some if we wanted a taste of fish with our chicken, steak, Kolbassa, salad etc...(that Meely sure puts on a spread...he is more than a g'weech maker)...they thought I was nuts but after tasting bluegills they changed their minds...    We did get into the crappies in the afternoon...  "
443312,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-13 14:15:00,2050," I see where you're coming from EC1 - I've just seen first hand what it's like down here in port rowan, when 3 guys go out in their boat for perch, keep their limit of 150 perch... clean them, give half of them away, eat some then go back for several consecutive weekends or even days and keep another 150, then 150 more.... They don't even care how small they are....  I don't care what anybody says, that can't be good for the fishery.  And in my opinion, this is likely a contributing factor as to why the perch fishing in the bay has been terrible the past few winters.  The problem with a high limit isn't from guys like you, who will harvest their limit, put some in the freezer, then maybe target another species, or leave the crappies be until you need to restock the freezer.  It's the people who abuse the limits, keeping fish even though they've got a full freezer, or even selling them illegally... it happens down here!  At the end of the day it's just personal preference though right.  I know if I kept 30 crappie it'd likely last me a whole year.  But for somebody like yourself, that clearly isn't the case, and who can blame you, they are tasty little critters.  If there was a 15 fish limit, it wouldn't bother me, that's 30 fillets.  But I live 8 minutes away from amazing panfish water.... so maybe I'm just spoiled!  As much as we anglers love to knock the biologists who come up with these limits, we have to put some faith in that they know what they're doing, and that it's what's best for our fishery.  So get out there and get you're 30 fish limit, but make sure to post pictures for us all....or it'll just be another fish tale! haha  Good luck out there guys, and be safe.  The water is still pretty damn cold after ice-out.  Cheers, Ryan"
443313,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-13 14:17:00,2050, Beans I'll take the fight and the meat from a big bluegill over big crappies any day.  Bluegill out-fight crappie 2 to 1 easy and the big ones aren't as skinny as them crappies..... they have a little more mean on their shoulders. mmmmmmmm only a couple weeks away for me!
443352,Beans,2010-03-13 16:16:00,3339," A few years ago we used to fish crappie at Rice Lake (no limit) in the evenings in the fall and there was an army of people taking home coolers full night after night...we used to give them ours until we found out they were selling them...After that you should have heard them crying when we tossed back big slabs about (1 1/2 lbrs)...""I'll take it...I'll take it""...""Naw...too small...too small""  Not too sure if it was illigel for them to sell the crappie but they wern't selling anymore of ours..."
443372,buckster,2010-03-13 16:52:00,530,
443434,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-13 18:51:00,2582,  Hey I've watched you put a big hurt on the Slabs using your Tony's specials...as Beansie calls them. HEHE...you will get buried in PM's now.  But this winter I did clean the tackle shoppe in Innisfil out of my secret colour that they don't make anymore so I should be able to at least catch as many as you this spring. Should have seen the look on the kids face when I took all 11 bags they had left
443438,Mykester,2010-03-13 18:55:00,241,"I use the smallest possible white twisty tails, they go crazy for that where I go and won't hit anything else."
443442,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-13 19:08:00,2582,"  I fish crappie for the fun of it. The few I keep I generally give to friends or family or use in my fish chowder, mainly because taste wise they are my least favourite panfish. Nobody gets my bluegill fillets though, unless you come to my house and eat them with me. Much better table fare in my opinion. And I also agree ounce for ounce nothing beats the scrap you get from a big gill on your line. If I could get 14-15 inch Bluegills I'd be in heaven."
443444,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-13 19:38:00,2050, Give me a couple weeks and I'll give you a bleugill report that'll make you sick to your stomach!
443447,EC1,2010-03-13 19:42:00,930,"Oh yup, And I wanted to ask this: Do you guys continue to use ice fishing sized jigs (size 8, 10, 12) with small baits when the ice just melts? Or are you guys already using normal sized jigs by then?"
443455,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-13 19:51:00,2582," SMACK...Sir may I have another... SMACK...Sir may I have another...  Bring it on Ryan, I can take it!"
