443907,Bondar,2010-03-15 01:49:00,817,"Tuesday i had an idea to get my grandfather out on the Niagara River for some steelhead action , so  I spoke with Paul from Cast adventures to book a trip , just so happened he had someone cancel on him,  so Thursday was open! I called up my gramps and told him that we had a trip booked and i'd pick him up at 730 Thursday morning ! got to the queenston ramp around 8 am and Paul was there and ready to go,  we got suited up in our floatsuits and off we went .  we hit the first drift of the day and it didnt take long at all for Paul to get us on the Fish , and keep us on them , we fished from about 9 am till 2pm and lets just say the fishing was really GOOD for pretty much the whole  time we were there, with a couple breaks for lunch and little tour of the shore line to see the sites and back to catching fish  we ended up with a Niagara grand slam as well a Laker a Brown and a rainbow  What a great day on the River with Great company a Day my Grandfather and myself  will never forget thats for sure            Thank you Paul for making this such a great day for us !!"
