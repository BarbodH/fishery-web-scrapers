If you're in a minimum wage job, don't blame the situation on the employer.  I should also note.. that the wife's god father started with little if nothing in his pocket but the dream to buy into a store (on borrowed money) and never lost sight of the dream...  He is also the person I learned "" the harder I work.. the luckier I get"" from ! ... as he is so sick and tired of people stating how lucky he is to have what he does."

I'm just trying to put together how you figure Canadian Tire is such a wonderful place to spend money. But I suppose it's not like there is any other stores in North America offering dirt cheap rods/reels, automotive parts and accessories, etc, etc. It's all produced offshore and that's what I stated was my problem with big block companies in the first place...that and crushing small businesses."

443248,charlesn,2010-03-13 04:50:00,551," I sure hope they don't close/although a BPS on the waterfront would be great.  They open early for people to get a NY license which is usually the primary reason I end up there, but I've bought a hoodie, rain jacket, mitts, gloves (you get the idea - underprepared for cold/wet weather) and always found it a bargain and the quality very high.  Fishing gear wise, I'm usually pretty well stocked already but have never left empty handed.  Never had the cashier problem you speak about, but I'm a very occasional visitor.  The Walmart in Dunkirk is usually license plan B."

I used to work at CTC in Barrie when it was the 2 story store in Bayfield mall.  I worked in the fishing department.  I was good back in the day.  Anyway, each summer the Billes kid came to work at our store in the paint dept.  He was maybe a year or 2 older than me but he drove a jag to work and then mixed paint all day.  Too funny.

I usually steer clear of the knock offs but the last few seasons I've been a big fan of their XPS minnows, best bargain in stickbaits going.  Their quality kicks Rapala in the slats, at almost half price.  Then again if non-fishing relatives didn't give me gift certificates as presents I probably wouldn't go in there much, Le Baron's has better non-sale pricing and smaller specialty places have better selection on specific items (trout fishing, Angling Outfitter's; trolling gear, Grimsby Tackle or Shortwave; Pete's & Bronte Tackle have a little bit of everything)."

They have stood behind these products when I did have a problem....like the battery charger that was 4.5 years old and 2.5 years out of warranty.....it stopped working so I called them to find out who made it so I could contact the company and see if there was anything I could do about it myself....they said ""That has our name on it"" send it back to us so we can evaluated it.....I spent $14 sending it back and they sent me the new updated one for FREE (my favorite 4 letter word) that cost $139......now would ANY LOCAL dealer do that for you ?  ?  ?

And lastly my favorite little shop with 2 young bros working their hearts out to make everyone feel welcome is Bills Bait and tackle in the Hammer(keep up the good work Tim and Greg).Fishmasters as well, thank you for your good service, steve(Ill be back to launch very soon). As for BPS, I support the locals!They will come close/ match or beat your prices.The service is below par at BPS.I called and asked the night before.I drove up there the next morning hoping for a price match and 10% disc if I purchased from them, as I was told.I brought a 2006 catalogue from lebarons with me and it was nov2005.I showed them the next years prices  for comparison.Guess what the clowns told me  The prices are out of date and its last years prices  HUH! I told lebarons and another outfit about it.$4000 later,BPS didnt see a dime of it, and I received much more than a 10% less than advertised. I will spend my dough on the locals any day of the week. Just my rant, and I needed to get it out of me. Cheers"

I distinguish between them and a Walmart, (or Eatons, who when they expanded into the west put lots of competition out of business). I bet the Morris family are as good people as you could meet.  That said, I still shop at Lebaron's and my local marina. BPS happens to be well-located for when I'm heading north, and I think they've helped fishing grow. Service to me is about inventory, and if BPS doesn't have something, I'll spend that much more money at their competitors', just to reward them for it. That's how it works for me.

Selection could be better as well.  On a positive, Cabelas announced just this week they are opening 2 new stores in western Canada. One to be open this spring, one this fall. holdfast, they will announce in two weeks the exact locations but rumours are Regina and Red Deer although I am going with Saskatoon and Edmonton. Never been one to go with the flow."
443095,steverowbotham,2010-03-12 23:04:00,1800,"BPS is a retail outlet, so not all the staff is going to have a deep knowledge base.  some of them are part time students paying bills, some are just merchandisers and shelf stockers.  We have many employees that have a vast knowledge, and there are some in each department at all times, I guarantee it.  As far as pricing on products, some is up, some is down thats the same anywhere.  Shops around on portable ice huts and find a cheaper place.. if you can, let me know."

443153,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-13 01:01:00,158,"I just want to point out that for every dollar you spend as bass pro would have been spent at a local shop if basspro wasn't there.  i think there was enough healthy competetion between stores in the GTA before bass pro came along.  I agree that fishing stuff with bass pro name on it usually sub-par when compared to the product it intends to copy/mimic.  They fishing section actual has a pretty pathetic selection, since half of it flooded with stuff with their own name on it.  Someone pointed out about internet sales, good point.   I have to agree.  Most local shops would be happy to order in something if they don't have it in stock. You mean I have to wait...  Gasp, oh the horror.  Good customer service is worth paying for and driving to imo.  I mentioned my concept in the openng post.  If you buy local, your money stay local, therefore it has a better chance of ending up back in your pocket.  Its not rocket science.  I honestly try and stay out of all big box stores, especially ones that aren't Canadian, which is most of them.  Like I said, if I spend money at a shop down the street, maybe that person will come eat at my restraunt, or buy something at my clothing store, or use my landscaping buisness.  When you spend your hard earned money at BPS, where does it go?  Yes I get that most of the products come from overseas, china, taiwan, mayalsia, blah blah blah, so it doesn't matter where you buy them.  Trust me, that gets to me as well.   I really like x-raps, guess where they are made, Estonia.  Not Finland, no wonder they are junk.  The point is at least some of your money stays local by shopping at a local shop.  I have actually started buying some lures and baits directly from the makers.  I am currently obsessed with musky fishing and some baits i buy now are right from the guys who labour to build them themselves in their own basements and garages.  In the future I also hope to buy my rods this way as well.  Its pricey, but a few quality items will get your further than a bunch of mass produced ones imo.  You save a buck today sure, but what is the cost in the future? I beleive we have to start somewhere.   I made my choice and stoppped going to PBS, Walmart, home depo all of it.  Just wanded to see if anyone else out there had as well.  I do believe everyone can do as they please, I don't begrudge anyone.  Thanks for sharing."

Soon everything will be built oversea's and we will all be crying that there's no jobs when in fact it was our own personal greed that drove everything to be built off shore.

443221,archie_james_c,2010-03-13 03:38:00,618," Sure a sliver of their profit stays in Canada...the rest pays for their entire inventory of junk exported from China and other Asian countries.  I'm interested to know how much of that money stays in Canada? How many Canadian jobs is ""Canadian Tire"" supporting? Well...if you read the bottom of 90% of the stuff they sell...not a whole lot. The only Canadian job's it supports are the stores employee's...and they treat them real good don't they...kinda like how well Walmart and McDonalds treats their employee's.

442929,JohnF,2010-03-12 15:10:00,3494,"This whole thing with dissing the big box shops generally originates from a group of concerns totally unrelated to the specific businesses being criticized. As the local grocery, hardware, appliance and clothing retailers gradually morphed into consolidated outlets, often with foreign ownership, their size enabled, even dictated, that the outlet be relocated to the periphery of the urban development for parking, access and cost reasons. This caused problems for the municipal core areas which were losing viability and even becoming ghost towns. Look back at Chatham's core a few years back. This meant there had to be a new effort to attract and retain viable enterprises in these core areas. A standard part of the battle was slagging the box shops with Walmart being the classic model. Municipal governments were pressured into using the Planning Act provisions and zoning regs to deter the urban decay/sprawl.  As has already been hinted at here by a few logical thinkers many small retailers simply didn't have the ability or inclination to change with the times, to strive to keep their clients' loyalty by improving or at least updating their business model (product, prices, business hours, etc). Some fought back with better personal service when they couldn't compete with the box shop prices. Unfortunately for many of them the internet and the manufacturer/distributors have no sympathy and have in many cases abused the local retailer's quality service and willingness to display the goods for sizing etc as an easy way for their bargain hunters to try sizes etc before they buy online. And that doesn't even begin to address the problem for the local retailer who is expected to handle all the warranty support for product bought online or from a department store which has no facility for service support (one of the reasons the box shop can sell for less).  The fact is we all love the idea of parking at the door and having lots of product selection to paw thru. To me Bass Pro or Cabela's is like a day at Disney World. And if I happen to see something that's too good to resist, naturally I'm gonna buy there. I commiserate with the local retailers but after watching my family agonize over whether or not to continue a successful children's clothing retail enterprise as the new business models nibbled away at our customer base I think we did the right thing in surrendering to the changing times and getting out of the business.  I guess what I'm saying is that the smalltown retailer may be doomed unless he's willing to change a bit. One way is to band together with similar businesses to have better purchasing power and clout with the distributor/manufacturers. Often the product cost to the low volume local guy is equal to or higher than the retail price offered by the box shop. The other is to offer the personal touch like Jos and his associates. That means though that they still have to maintain good inventory and competitive pricing but they seem to be holding up just fine.  Hey, I'm a big fan of the local retailer surviving. I love to wander into the local Fishing Store when I have a few minutes, to ask questions and occasionally to pick up a piece of gear to go along with the advice. In fact I buy most of my gear there but once in a while I'll spot a bargain like the $99.95 Calcutta that I found in one of my box shop perambulations in Ohio. Byron showed me his dealer price list on that reel and even offered to buy it from me at a $50 profit.  I really want to keep him and his store here in Stratford. I like to have a place to go locally when I need stuff or advice. I'll support him to the best of my ability but I doubt any amount of complaining or wishing it were so will make the box shops go away. They're here to stay and as JP says they're probably doing us a favour by making our local guys be the best they can be. Hopefully, for their sake and our own, it'll be enuf.  One last thought. The next time you go into your local retailer to see how a product feels in your hand or to try it on for sizing before you order online to save a few bucks ask yourself what it will be like when you've driven all the local stores out of business and you have to guess at sizing or just trust to luck that an online product will be what it's represented to be. Would it have been worth a few extra bucks to have bought locally to keep that local guy in business? Sadly, some of you will never get that concept.  JF"

442976,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-12 17:07:00,0,personally BPS is not for me.  and that's nothing to do with any of the politics discussed in this thread...  i find much of their stuff cheaply made/overpriced and find smaller stores back their products more readily than BPS...  i could save money through purchasing some terminal tackle through them but it's not worth the hassle of getting off the expressway when i pass through the big smoke.
442979,JPD,2010-03-12 17:14:00,296,"That is the one advantage that the smaller stores have and will always have, customer service. Not to say Bass Pro has bad customer service because in reality they are very good to deal with but the knowledge base in a small store can be much more refined since they don't have a bunch of staff to train.  I think we are incredibly fortunate, as TJ said, to have stores like Angling Outfitters, Fishing World, Angling Specialties, Gagnons, Natural Sports, Hirks and JB's because they know what their clients are looking for and what their area thrives on. They are still around because of the specialty items and service they give and will continue to be there.  Any tackle store that complains about a company like Bass Pro, who ultimately has increased the profile of the industry in which they try to make a living is nuts, if they are good at what they do, they should only benefit from the increased attention to the sport of fishing.  The last thing I would want to see happen is the smaller retailers shut down, that would set back fishing for sure. The biggest problem for them stems not from competition from Bass Pro, it stems, as mentioned before and by a few, from internet sales. The internet will not offer the assistance that your local retailer will offer or the last minute option to pick up hooks before your trip without waiting for shipping.  JP"
442990,Cudz,2010-03-12 17:51:00,2652,"I love any store that sells fishing gear.  I don't even care if they are more or less expensive than other stores.  I just like looking at fishing gear and I usualy end up buying at least one thing in the store.   I can remember back in the day when Sears, Kmart, towers and zellers also sold fishing equipment.  I loved it.  PS.  I will be on y way to BPS today.  I will bet there at 4 ish.  I will be the one with 3 little kids running around and Jaydub will have his 4 little kids there so there will be 6 little blond girls and 1 little boy running around causing chaos there.  Sorry to the employees who have to clean up after but we do our best to limit our mess.  By the way my kids love BPS.  It is kind of like wonderland in the winter when wonderland is not open."

443029,adempsey,2010-03-12 19:38:00,1498,"I shop at many different stores within an hour drive of my home.  I can't imagine buying all the things I want at a single shop.  I go to local stores because they carry items I cannot find anywhere else.  Prices can be better too.  I worked next to JB's and went there all the time.  Best prices on St.Croix rods, Yamamoto baits and has a great selection of musky tackle.  I don't do any downrigger fishing but if I did, that is where I would go as well.  I go to CT for something to do.  Generally overpriced, but they can have items I cannot find anywhere else.  For example, I looked everywhere for spin bubbles but only found them at CT.  I also picked up some really old Len Thompsons that looked like they were there for 20 years.  Just thought they were cool.  Sometimes they will have a lure in a color that I was looking for that I couldn't find anywhere else.  I go to Walmart to look at the clearance items.  Sometimes you can get great deals, not so much lately.   I recently discovered some Yum grubs in a lime green color that I had never seen anywhere, not even on the Yum website.  All the Walmarts in my general area (about 10 of them) looked to have really scaled back on the fishing section lately.  It's very unlikely I will go there specifically for fishing gear though.  BPS is great for me.  I can go to the mall with my family and not be bored to death shopping for clothes.  I just got back from the big sale they have on and got some good deals as well.   The Vaughan store also carries Canadian made lures (e.g., Lucky Strike, Len Thompson) that I don't think they sell at the US stores [at least they don't show up on the website], so it shows that they at least have some flexibility and are not forced to carry all the same items.  I also visit Lebaron regularly.  They have good prices on some of their items.  I often buy bigger ticket items there due to the discount card and their prices are often cheaper anyway (not as much as they used to be though).   Their tackle selection also differs from the other stores.  Even the two Lebaron stores in the GTA differ in what they carry.  Stores like Radioworld are also great.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for my electronics.  I also order online.   Many times from Cabelas and from some smaller retailers like Jammin Jigs.  Whenever I go away I try to visit the local tackle/bait shops as well.   I often pick up something, most often a locally made spinnerbait or something.    Sometimes I get lucky and find a lure or a color that has been discontinued.  Bottom line, BPS doesn't always have the best prices nor do they have a huge selection (at least as far as fishing tackle goes); a lot of their stuff is their own brand, which I don't particular like.  So for me, it is not a one stop shop and I doubt it ever will be."
443030,ehg,2010-03-12 19:38:00,2666,Really...how many Wal-Marts in Canada?
443033,charlesn,2010-03-12 19:54:00,551,"The BPS in Grapevine Texas (DFW Metroplex area near the airport) has a great steak restaurant and a brewery.  Yup, you read that right, a brewery!!!  I've been to it every time I've flown to DFW and I was hoping and praying Vaughan would have the same when it was being built.  As far as supporting local, I think it is great to support those that support you.  All I know is that BPS seems to give a whole lot back to the anglers through conservation and prizing and other stuff.  I know I've spent thousands of dollars in other local shops and couldnt even buy a smile at the cash register with a 100 dollar bill taped to my forehead...  I've heard their service improved once they were no longer the big boy in town.  That's good to hear but way too little to late for me and many others from the stories I've heard.  I'm not sure what it is about Cabelas that you guys like.  The one in Michigan was very very underwhelming for me.  Maybe because I don't hunt?  One store I really like that is sorta a big box is Gander Mountain near the airport in Buffalo.  Luckily I never need help or customer service at a tackle shop because I already know everything!!!"
443040,Cudz,2010-03-12 20:14:00,2652,I think there are 7 wal-marts in Canada.
443052,adempsey,2010-03-12 20:41:00,1498, There are 244 Walmarts and 76 Walmart Superstores in Canada as of Jan 2010.

442849,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-12 08:01:00,158,"I know I am gonna' catch a ton of flack for sayin' that, but I am just wondering if anyone else out there agrees?   Not only is bass pro not the one stop shop it pretends to be, but it hurts the little guy.  I for one like to buy off of a neighbour, in hopes they will send money my way in some shape or form by buying goods or services that i have to offer.  And before anyone says they can't afford to shop anywhere else, you really haven't shopped around.  let the ranting begin...."
442852,lew,2010-03-12 09:38:00,12766," They sell fishing gear, fishing clothing, hunting gear, hunting clothing, boats, boat accessories, outboard motors, electric motors, electronics, archery equipment, camping gear, very good outdoor clothing, boots, hiking gear yada yada yada  Just curious as to why you say it's ""not the one stop shop it pretends to be"" and what is it your looking for that they don't carry ?? Actually, I don't ever recall BPS saying they carried absolutely everything an outdoorsman would need anyways, but perhaps I missed that part.  As for hurting the little guy, it seems to me that the ""little guys"" around the GTA that were doing  well before BPS came along are still doing well. Fishing World in Hamilton, 2 LeBarons locations, JB's in Toronto, Tightlines in Pickering, Gagnons in Oshawa  Sure there were some small Mom & Pops that went under after BPS arrived, but from my perspective, they were the ones that never improved themselves or grew with the times anyways. Same tired old baits sitting on the dusty shelves for 20 years, same old ratty fish mounts hanging on the walls and not many improvements done over the years to attract or keep customers anyways.  In my own personal opinion, and for what it's worth, I think the smaller shops that keep up with the times as far as new gear goes, have knowlegable friendly staff and offer good customer service have nothing to worry about with the likes of BPS  Personally, I buy most of my musky gear from JB's just because I like the people and  what they offer, but I still enjoy wandering around BPS because I think it's a very nice store, almost like a mini-Sportsman Show.  As for prices, I bought a 400 TE from JB's awhile back that was $115 LESS than BPS  The one thing I DO find frustrating at BPS though is the fact that so many of the staff aren't familiar with the products their selling, but you'll find that in most big stors that hire alot of part-timers.  Course, this is only my opinion on the way I see things"
442854,Handlebarz,2010-03-12 10:24:00,3790,"I pass by BPS when in Ohio and love stopping there the guys and girls are great and some prices are crazy cheap I also really like the store in Rossford Ohio but I do also shop at the local guys here in Chatham. Bass Haven is the best bet Dennis has the right stuff not just alot of extra crap you would never use  There is a NEW store in Belle River I think it's called big catch outdoors I have not made it in yet but here they are very good I have met the guys before and they are very nice guys they hand make knives that will last forever as well as a fish gripper thing for cleaning fish its cool and the wife loves hers.  In Windsor Wallys is hard to beat he has alot of stuff that is used at his door step on the DR river,Erie and LSC.  I really enjoy trip when I can to a small store in Lambeth just west of London on HWY 2 Steve is a great guy to chat with and has a very nice small store not alot of stuff but again he has what people want and ask for.  Then the big small guy Angling Outfitters its hard to believe that he might have as much or more then BPS in his small store I have bought alot here and even bought my GPS/Sonar there for more then I would pay in the USA at the time just because his customer  service is #1.  I guess what I am trying to say is along the lines of LEW if you keep up with the times the small stores will be around for a long time.  Yes we have alot of competition for the store in my neck of the woods with in 30 min of these Chatha/Windsor stores you can be a many different Gander mountain stores and als oBPS not to mention Dicks Sporting goods. With in a 1 1/2 hours you can be in Ohio at BPS then Gander then Janns net craft then up to MI for Caballas we have a lot of choice here in the SW and the good shops are still around.  Many thanks to the guys who help us on the local front."

442867,Radnine,2010-03-12 11:51:00,1538,"I think that all one had to do is drive through Hamilton or Brantford down town cores, then drive to the mall and check out the parking lot there, to see the ""big box"" effect in action. Now, whether it is right or wrong, or inevitable, or evolution etc. is a debate that will rage on forever. I still love going to Bass Pro. Like Lew said, for us it is like a trip to the sportsman show. Having said that, I feel almost the same stopping at Epps on the way up highway 11. I love the small shops, I do. But am finding that the idea of driving to the local shop and hoping that they have the Rapala (for instance) in the colour and size that you want, is getting very antiquated. If you have time for advanced planning, and the items are not too heavy, buying on the Internet seems to be the way to go. Jim"
442868,Paully,2010-03-12 11:58:00,712,BPS is a great place .. just don't ask any questions regarding their products.   They seldom know what they're talkin about.
442875,desship,2010-03-12 12:26:00,96,Nice place to look see and then leave . Cheaper at other stores. Check their price in flyer with Radioworld or Le Baron and guess who is cheaper on large ticket items.

Lets not forget both Bass Pro and Walmarts are a Business.  Both have Lower Prices and variety of selections which is good for competition.  Why am I like this, as a Military Soldier, I was posted in Wainwright AB, and Petawawa before Walmarts, even FM stations were brought in and they have made the Quality of life a whole much better.  Maybe Im not spoiled.  You should feel lucky to shop at a Bass Pro, thankfully since this year, I only have to travel 7 hours to Calgary to visit my closest shop."

442897,JPD,2010-03-12 13:46:00,296,"I have to disagree with a few things... firstly, Bass Pro employs more Canadians in that store than all of the other tackle stores in Ontario combined...  They also donate more money to local conservation efforts (Yes, LOCAL) than any other store in Canada and have been doing so since their start.  Regarding other stores... this one is a real kicker... Bass Pro has also made the other stores, like Lew said, who are willing to advance with the times, better... why? Because BPS has brought more new people into fishing that have never picked up a rod or haven't gone in years with their ""walartness"" store that acts as an attraction. a day with the kids or better yet and pass through to the mall. All the eye candy you see get's people interested and creates new anglers. Most of the stores that are still standing are actually doing better.. the internet has hurt more store owners than BPS ever will in it's lifetime!  Yes, other stores are cheaper on some items and that's also great news for the smaller guy. BPS has not come to Canada and flexed their muscles and used their buying power to destroy the market... they have 100 times if not 1000 times the overhead than a 2000 sq ft store has, 100 times the employees, marketing and donations... so they charge accordingly.  Keeping it local is a pretty sad excuse to use for not visiting BPS... just about 98% of the lures in every tackle store are made elsewhere, not by the local store owners, so who are you really supporting? China? The USA? Who cares! We all need tackle, reels and rods and whoever has the best deal gets the business.. but the repeated kicking at bigger companies on here without qualifying your reasons really gets old quick.  BTW... seminars are free, parking is free, charity BBQ for Mercer's Casting for a Cure Cancer fundraiser and other BBQ's to support local conservation efforts, 40,000 reels donated through the reel trade in program to kids fishing organizations and the fact that the reel prices during the trade in are well below their cost, yup! They're really hurting Ontario!  Sorry for the rant  JP"
442898,outllaw,2010-03-12 13:50:00,1232,"bass pro is a generality store. greaty to explore. as guys specialize in species its normally a regional thing. local sporting goods stores do specialize in knowledge. finding out the hot info of...where, what their biting on, weather reports is priceless.. big box stores do not carry specialty items.theres many quality products that fishermen seek that the walmarts, bass pro,s dont carry."
442900,OhioFisherman,2010-03-12 13:50:00,6623,"LOL, Toys-R-Us? A very good tackle shop in my area, and I know and have fished with the people that run it. They are all fishermen and good ones! I still used to go to BPS and Cabela`s, Janns Netcraft at times, they took the place of the Cleveland Sportsman show for me.  Quantity purchases made where the cost was the cheapest, but in time of need locally. Some stores carry different products, it is nice to have options. Not really into house brand lures and such, but is anything made in our countries any more any way? BPS seems to have caught on to that fairly quickly and push their house brands, for nearly the same prices that name brands carry, and the price of a few lures is more than the poor dude in China or Korea makes in a day for turning out hundreds of them.  LOL Bass-Mart?"

I do however support their efforts to build fishing exposure in this province and will not slam them for the buisness tactics... that being said, I have to agree with Raf, personally, I would have preferred a Cabela's in that location.

Personally I love BPS, they have been more than helpful with everything Ive ever asked of them, prizes, donations etc.  The first time I went into the store, I was astounded.   Personally I think that (and don't take this the wrong way)  alot of urban dwellers are spoiled when it comes to shopping.  Ive said it before... I get one isle to shop at in my Local CT.  I don't go to Bass Pro for prices, I go for selection.   Its a treat for me to shop there.  And its right on my way in and out of Toronto!

BUT when I had to be in Toronto last year, thanks to directions on how to get there from the board members here, I discovered that BPS was just minutes away from my aunts apartment where I was staying.  Needless to say, I had to go and see the store and the stuff they carried. I would have been more impressed if I hadn't been to Cabelas in Owatanna just a few months earlier.  The store is nicely laid out and it was easy to find some of the things I needed but since I was flying home I couldn't get too much.  On my way to the airport (flying out of Sault Ste Marie) I stopped at the service centre on the 400 north that has the bait shop and I asked the guy at the bait shop how BPS had affected his business. They told me, it really hadn't. In fact they told me they regularly supply BPS with minnows and since they were open early and BPS didn't open until 10am they did a good business with fishermen who wouldn't wait til the 10am time came."
442924,hirk,2010-03-12 14:53:00,571,"I think the point Muskygreenhorn is making is that once the money goes to BPS it no longer circulates within the community (he's referring to area in the outlying GTA I believe).I agree with you JP BPS does do alot of good things and yes having a shop where I'm located I do lose business to them but I don't begrudge them or my customers that shop there (95% do at some point),people work for their money and if BPS has a deal that saves them dough then hell I tell em you better jump on it lol, we don't live in a vacume,there is always competition.Now with Walmart because they park there stores right in many smaller communities I do have issues with their business model.They suck money out and all that remains to circulate is the minimum wage they pay.My 18yr old out of the blue started telling me he didn't like Walmart because of the negative effects it has on small towns,blew me away that he had on his own grasped the whole idea of capital moving around ie. Joe pays me to fix his house and I pay Ed to fix my car etc.,if too many business's suffer in sales Joe can't pay me so poor Ed loses because I have to fix the car myself and it goes on like a wave.There are small towns in the US that ended up ghost towns because once too many people lost thier jobs due to the ripple effect and had no money Walmart pulled out due too poor sales,leaving no jobs never mind minimum wage.Muskygreenhorn is a great customer of mine and I am thankful that he supports my business.Go easy on him guys,he's just expressing his social conscience with concern for his community."
442925,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-12 14:57:00,2582,I like wandering through and would probably do it regularly if it was closer. However it is too far away for that. And I can buy locally cheaper then I can at BPS and save the drive so I just don't go.  I have been in the store maybe 5 times since it opened. Except for a good pair of hunting boots I probably have not spent $50 there in those 5 visits.
