443537,Daplumma,2010-03-14 00:14:00,1961,"Try to do it yourself,there is a guy or two here that can help you through it.Spiel has put some guides on one of my rods,as well as the handle,the seat ..well he built the whole durn thing he did.There are also some other rod builders here . Joe"
443651,Spiel,2010-03-14 11:41:00,9065,Well if you were closer to Hamilton I'd be happy to do it for you but since you're not why not try and do it yourself as Daplumma suggested. It's not difficult and there's plenty of online info and I'd be happy to offer any needed advice.
