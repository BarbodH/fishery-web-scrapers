With moving up north and college generally keeping me too busy to fish, I was eagerly awaiting this reading week to head back home and hit up my favourite steelhead waters.  I arrived to prime water conditions and decent numbers of fish.  Hope all you steelheaders got out and enjoyed the prime conditions.  Here's some pics.  Enjoy.  All fish were released.       Now for some northern speckles."
