It was my inaugural season for guiding on the ice, and I would say it was very successful.  Thank you to all who supported me and continue to support me over the years, to all that read my posts and follow my story.  I'm going to take a couple weeks of personal time and smash some steelhead, then in a few weeks time I'll be back on the water guiding and fun fishing for perch, crappie and Kawartha pike.  Should be a blast!  I spent most of my season on the West side of Simcoe fishing Lefroy up to Hawkestone, depths changed every day, but my best depth for trout was around 91 feet and my best depth for perch was about 45ft.  My top producers with season for perch were small jigging rapalas and a small scud bug fished on 2lbs test.  Top producers for trout were the zonker jigs, laker takers and tubes, hands down.  Enjoy some pics from the season.  Thanks again for looking!  fund day out for myself, getting a feed of perch  first trout of the year, January 7th  Mike with a beauty laker on the laker taker  Outfished 4-3 by my fiancee  test driving the zonker  The famous white faces  couple for the smoker  tank caught by myself, bad pic  A good day for the gumbos  Another solid fish on the laker taker  Love taking the old man out  Nice one  Some keepers for the ladies  4 hours work  Sometimes I go for suckers of the deep  nice whitie on the spoon  4 hours of productive fishing  Good way to bond with the father-in-law  No complaints  One of hundreds released to swim another day   board members do it best  first 5 minutes  Loved the hookset and cheers!  awesome!  headed home early with their limit  brotherly love  Great way to end the season  Thanks again everyone,  Tight lines!"
