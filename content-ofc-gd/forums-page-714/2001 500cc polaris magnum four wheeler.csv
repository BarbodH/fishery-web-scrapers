443502,livinisfishin,2010-03-13 22:39:00,661,Has 265 hours on it. Im looking at buying an atv soon and im not quite sure what route i want to go. Through a dealer or classifieds. Thanks

443509,Fang,2010-03-13 23:03:00,1330,"I'm in the same boat, looking to pick one up for next years hunting/ice fishing season. What I've been doing is reveiwing kijiji ATV listing's weekly to give me an idea of asking prices. After a couple of weeks you'll see the same ATV's relisted at lower pricing. Auto trader seems to have a lot of dealers and not much private sales  Without seing make and model I'd say a 2001 should be in the $3.5-4K range"
443547,livinisfishin,2010-03-14 00:40:00,661,It is really hard trying to find something. No matter what kind of model or make it always will end up being slammed. In the end i guess it will just come down to gut feeling. Are polaris atvs really that bad compared to any other brands?
443549,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-03-14 00:48:00,160,if you dont mind spending the extra money go with the dealer. I bought an atv last year (used) and it was in really bad shape and me and my dad never knew until we took to a dealer and they showed my dad the problems and the repairs are too much.
443554,livinisfishin,2010-03-14 00:51:00,661,Thanks fishman i probably will end up doing that.
443557,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-03-14 00:54:00,160,its more reliable and the quad itself can be beaten up and you dont want that.
443559,livinisfishin,2010-03-14 00:58:00,661,Know of any dealers that have a decent used selection?
443583,GeorgeJ,2010-03-14 01:46:00,207,"to answer your original question an 01 Magnum's worth, about $3000 give or take a couple hundred dollars. A good machine but almost any 9 year old quad will require some spending here and there to keep them going, also for what it is worth in the crowd I ride with it seems the Polaris's need a little more attention than the others."
