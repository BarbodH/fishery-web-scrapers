I'm not sure what the official highs have been the past two days but to describe it as ""tee shirt weather"" is an understatement. Yesterday we had a lunch time bar b que at the job site and it was almost too hot when standing in the sun in a tee shirt. I had to duck into the shade occasionally. The snow is gone. Small ponds and lake shores are opening up. When I arrived here two weeks ago we would drive 5 miles or so across Red Lake to get to the job site and back. Not anymore. The ice shacks that littered the lake a week ago are only a memory now. I'm not sure if it was last spring or the spring before that, but a member here was concerned about the lakes being ice free here by May long weekend. That's over two months away from now. This year the question is will they be open by the end of March. Anyways, I'm enjoying every minute of it. Surely it will change back to normal highs at some point in time, but I'll take it for now."

443912,Whopper,2010-03-15 02:02:00,2174,"Dan I was one of them two years ago that was concerned about ice out in the Red Lake area the day before walleye opener We were held up in town for four hours before flying out to a still half frozen Little Vermillion, ice wasn't completely off the lake until the following Tuesday. It was my first experience that far north at ice out and it was awesome, we weren't in tshirts thought"
443913,danc,2010-03-15 02:13:00,4677,grt1... check your message box.  Phil. That was you?? You'd never know it was the same place if you were here right now. Any chance you might be heading up this way this year? I could be here for a very long time.
443914,tjsa,2010-03-15 02:15:00,1578,"Yup, an 'el nino year again. A bud of mine pointed out to me when this happens, we typically get less snowfall. But, this year is ridiculous. I am enjoying it though, just does not bode well for fish that spawn in the spring unless we get rain, and lots of it.  A few years ago, guys were out fishing on open water before the walleye season closed mid April for a month and a bit. Probably going to be the same thing this year unless the temps dip."
