443168,Dozer,2010-03-13 01:34:00,896,Do you have a website that you sell your art?  Interested.
443193,bushart,2010-03-13 02:32:00,2628,  Nah there's about 3 or 4 more stones on the road I have'nt kicked yet---I'm probably going to get one---I've got issues with art on the internet---The whole thing is so saturated I don't know how anybody can sift through it all to find what they want.  To date I've stayed traditional with galleries---I may be forced soon though.
