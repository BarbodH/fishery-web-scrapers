Sold off my older cheap spinning rods last fall and have started the replacement collection of more expensive rods/reels  So far I got a Rapala R-Type Baitcaster with a Rapala TS2 7'MH Rod(15lb Fluorocarbon), and a Abu Garcia Revo SX with a Rapala R-Type 7'2""MH Rod(50lb Power Pro Braid)  I got a good setup for fairly heavy cover jig and frog fishing also using it for the pike it will handle those toothy fish without a problem go a great multi purpose combo. The other will be used for spinnerbaits and plastics for the season.  Can't wait to get out fishin for Pike this week!  :D"

443527,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-13 23:43:00,3761,Look for the hat...say hi
443530,ColdH20guy,2010-03-13 23:54:00,312,hey Mike did u end up joining the Lindsay Bassmasters? just curious....
443546,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-14 00:39:00,3761,No I did not. Went to a meeting and liked the crowd but after some serious thought I'm not just well prepared this year. I have a summer job to commit to. Next season it's a possibility for sure.
443550,hockeyplayerz_14,2010-03-14 00:49:00,160,i like that fire tiger colour
443588,danbouck,2010-03-14 01:55:00,4380,nice setup
443616,ohhenrygsr,2010-03-14 03:16:00,947,Nice Setup's Mike
443695,BillM,2010-03-14 15:00:00,17367,"Mike, take those lures off...you'll do nothing but scratch both your rod and reel"
443830,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-14 22:30:00,3761," Haha, no they wont. I got the lure wraps and the rod socks...guess I need to get some of those hook covers now."
443833,BillM,2010-03-14 22:40:00,17367,  .........or you could just store the lures in a tacklebox like the rest of us do
443843,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-03-14 23:07:00,1107,MTBF Hook your lures on the hndle of your BC reel no scrathes and they are easier to carry a few at a time without hooking yourself I always leave my rods rigged prolly shouldn't but this way protects the blank and reel from getting scratched to crap .    nice stix by the way.
443891,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-15 01:15:00,3761,"Ya, it keeps the hooks off of the blank, thanks for the idea. On single hook I'll put it on the hook keeper usually. Whatever works right."
443908,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-03-15 01:51:00,1107,I use the handle all the time unless its a wacky rig hook (they don't stay very good) I find that bullet weights and large offset hooks ding the blank quite often.
