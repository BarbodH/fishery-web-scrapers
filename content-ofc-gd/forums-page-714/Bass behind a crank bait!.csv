443106,ehg,2010-03-13 00:00:00,2666,All these little underwater videos are great
443113,dheitzner,2010-03-13 00:09:00,314," You said it!!! Keep the underwater vids coming T.J., really entertaining to watch. Do you just use an Aquaview with a recording device?"
443133,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-13 00:29:00,3761,Cool video TJ. Next time slow down the crank and you will catch that fish bud
443142,Dozer,2010-03-13 00:42:00,896,"I love the footy you've got, keep 'em coming.  I love them 'cause they show how the fish reacts, how far it chases, how it strikes.... lets me appreciate them more.  I think fishing is more than ""hey mines bigger than yours!"", more about the beauty of the animal."
443145,Leecher,2010-03-13 00:47:00,7832,Ya should of changed lures TJ..... it wasn't interested enough for a strike but pretty cool to watch Leechman
443146,tomO,2010-03-13 00:48:00,363,I like the 70s porn music !
443217,TJQ,2010-03-13 03:28:00,7806,"Yup.. an aqua vu and a recording device.. whne I originally did these I didnt bother capturing the misses... but later.. well they seem almost more interesting to me.  Ive go lots more coming, im trying to get one or two a day done, so I have a bunch more for the next few months.. then.. im gonna get some NEW stuff done!"
443243,archie_james_c,2010-03-13 04:34:00,618,  Agreed . Keep it up TJ!
443443,dheitzner,2010-03-13 19:13:00,314, RIGHT ON!!!!
