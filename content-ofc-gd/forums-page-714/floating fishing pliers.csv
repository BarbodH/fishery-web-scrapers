443361,kickingfrog,2010-03-13 16:32:00,8333, Good idea! I think I'll use a lifejacket.
443363,Spiel,2010-03-13 16:37:00,9065, Well since I've seen that you generally wear your lifejacket at all times they'd always be handy.

They work, and they float - controlled testing only  When you squeeze them tight, the handles squeeze in more once the teeth come together, seems a liitle weak that they flex like that.  They do work though, never had any problems with them and they are easy to find, use due to the colour.  They also have a wrist lanyard.  They have a carbide cutting blade that works good with braid, except it flattens out the end a bit as the blade squeezes the line against a flat piece of metal to make the cut.  The cut is clean, no fraying, but just flat.  I would recommend them, but only at a steep discount.  They aren't worth the $20 regular price."
