427607,Bass Tard,2010-01-30 16:37:00,128,"Okay, so we're not able to make our usual trip to the usual place this summer due to restrictions with time off and now we're scrambling to find something soon so we don't miss our vacation.  This place seems like people would know where they stay and what's good.  What we're looking for: Lakefront 3+ bedrooms 4ish hour drive from London crap-zu's allowed  Any help would be appriciated, its so hard to find good information online, a lot of it is cobbled or just poorly marketed.  Thanks!"
427646,yakpiker,2010-01-30 18:02:00,160,I've rented cottages through this website before...will probably use them again this year...good selection at different prices.  http://www.northerncomfort.com/
427649,sandybay,2010-01-30 18:09:00,64, What's a crap-zu?
427654,SBCregal,2010-01-30 18:28:00,688,shih tzu maybe? wonder if the board censored it
427668,Big Cliff,2010-01-30 18:56:00,6899,Do you have your own boat or do you want a cottage with one? Do you want something with a beach? For how long and what dates?
427709,Bass Tard,2010-01-30 22:04:00,128,"crap-zu is indeed the dog but OFC is too worried about offending anyone by our dog species..  More details: I have a 17' aluminum bass boat that I will be bringing but we will be looking to rent a boat from somewhere nearby, or on the resort or whatever. Beach we don't care about, we'll be relaxing in the sun for fun, fishing, and perhaps having some beer but none of us are swimmers. And it's for July 10-18th ish.  Normally we go away for Canada day long weekend but I just started a new job and I'm on contract for now and can't control when I get time off, hence looking for a new destination.  Thanks for the help so far guys!"
427713,Big Cliff,2010-01-30 22:22:00,6899,"Give these guys a look, they are just down the road from us and I have heard some really good things about them, I do know that they fill up early and they always seem full.  Lunge Haven Cottages"
427715,solopaddler,2010-01-30 22:30:00,8605,What type of fish would you prefer to catch? Do you want a private cottage rental or a resort? Is water access okay or do you prefer drive to?
427716,Roy,2010-01-30 22:33:00,13728," Had ""shih tzu"" been correctly spelled, it would have gotten posted. Sorry.  Good luck in your search."
427887,Bass Tard,2010-01-31 15:56:00,128,"  Bass, walleye, pike, something along those lines. Either is fine, but we're looking to be able to score a rental boat from somewhere close if it's a private rental, I only have one boat with two seats, and there's six of us. Water access is fine, but again with the one boat thing..."
427891,Big Cliff,2010-01-31 16:04:00,6899,"Sturgeon Lake has all except the pike, lots of muskie though. If you do decide to come up this way, let me know and I'd be happy to give you a quick tour and show you a few spots to get you started. One good thing about Lunge haven (although there are many) you don't have far to go to get into some really good fishing and even if it is a very windy day, you can fish the river which is somewhat sheltered from the wind."
427902,solopaddler,2010-01-31 17:09:00,8605,There's literally endless possibilities. Here's a good one that I'd check into if I was looking. It's a water access private cottage on the Pickeral river downstream from hwy.69. It gives you access to miles and miles of beautiful water to explore including the lower French and the Bad River delta if you're adventurous. I'm familiar with the area which is why I looked for one here. Great fishing for all species. Boat rentals are available as well.  http://www.montaguelodge.com/index.htm
427918,Musky or Specks,2010-01-31 18:04:00,2710,Give my buddy a try He rents a nice lakefront cottage on Lake Restoule. He also has boats on back lakes in the area.  http://www.northbayonline.ca/businesses.php?accnum=3276  Unfortunately he only has the one cottage so you have to book early.
428138,grt1,2010-02-01 01:22:00,638,"I got a buddy that runs Fees Landing on the Kawartha Lakes, he has been on the fishing show that Charlie Wray has. It is pretty close to London, Give Fees Landing a google."
428162,Radnine,2010-02-01 02:11:00,1538," I am not sure where you are looking, but I find it super easy to find great places to stay on line. You should have seen the misrepresentation of shacks when all you had to go on was a three line ad in the classified section. Here are a couple of sites that I have had success with.  http://www.cottagelink.com  http://www.cottagesincanada.com  http://www.cottage-canada-usa.com  Looking for great cottages to rent has become a bit of a hobby of mine and the search is half the fun. Don't forget that if you find the information lacking on the site you can always email the owner and ask for more photos. Good luck! Jim"

428701,torco,2010-02-02 15:08:00,656,This website is excellent for private cottage listings which for my situation is the only way to go.  http://www.ontariocottagerental.com/  We are in the process of booking a cottage for 10 people plus multiple dogs and people tend to give us a harder time with German Shepherds.

428800,davew3,2010-02-02 20:44:00,430,Check these out.  We stayed at this one.  Reasonable price.  http://www.cottagesunlimited.com/cottpages/cott181b.htm  http://www.findcottage.ca/cordovalakecottage.html  This is just east of Peterborough and offers excellent fishing.  Walleye right off the dock.  Good luck.
428805,tb4me,2010-02-02 20:59:00,3295,"Here is the company we have used and recomended for 6 yrs now..we just bought our own place so the least I can do for them is recomend them http://www.cottagerentals247.com/ ask for Cathy..Tell her exactally what you are looking for and she will hook you up..Man the last cottage we rented from them was a beautifull a frame cottage on elephant lake..absolutly amazing..If you wish to rent another boat I recomend elephant lake lodge.They have a bar and a restraunt right across the lake from that cottage we rented!! They can put you on almost any lake thou. They are into thier 9th rental season with over 120 beautiful cottages. In orderfor them to rent any cottage out,  they must all have direct access to good waterfront.Just give her a call, she wil do the rest"

443883,Billy Bob,2010-03-15 01:05:00,5865,I would stay away from Rice Lake....rumor has it you will ONLY be allowed 300 fish to keep compared to like 4 walleyes elsewhere...
