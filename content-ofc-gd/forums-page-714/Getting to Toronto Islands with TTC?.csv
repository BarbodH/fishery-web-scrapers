Google is a bit sketchy, would like to get a second opinion. Thanks.  EDIT: Website says this:  Take a subway to Union station and street car 509 or 510 to Queen's Quay Stop. Union station is quite close to the Ferry Docks so you can get there by foot.  Is this correct?"

Alternatively, take the street car (doesn't matter which) and get off at the first stop.  Climb up the stairs to street level and walk to the docks.  I always take the subway down"
