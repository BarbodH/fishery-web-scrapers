439015,Lunatic,2010-03-02 22:40:00,536,"I'm already dreaming about summer fishing. usually every year we do a fair amount of camping but once a year head out to muskoka/haliburton to a cottage/resort on a lake so my gf and i can rent a boat,do some fishing,go hiking ect. we like to have resorts because of the activities in the area,but not big resorts,the last few we've gone to were private cabins on lakes.  anyone have ideas where i can go this summer,with a small boat rental available and have good LMB fishing. i like to fish lakes with pads n such rather then trolling.  i dont want to travel more then 4 hours of toronto. thanks for any help"
