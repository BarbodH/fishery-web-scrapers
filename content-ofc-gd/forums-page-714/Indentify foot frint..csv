443111,Spiel,2010-03-13 00:06:00,9065,Given the amount of snow melt in those tracks I'd be hard pressed to even venture a guess.
443115,Syn,2010-03-13 00:12:00,519,Some of them look like shoe prints walking back and forth and they have melted.
443120,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-13 00:16:00,3761,"No idea, take pictures when the tracks are fresh and have a measuring tape with you. Measure the width and length of the individual track then a set of tracks.  We have been doing animal tracking and those don't look to familiar to me at all.  Good luck, MTBF"
443125,BIG FISH,2010-03-13 00:23:00,54,looks like  linx but hard to tell forsure
443128,irishfield,2010-03-13 00:27:00,26272,Porqupine !  LOL.. they're melted holes for god sakes... who knows!  Lynx.. would be much bigger.. I have a girl at the camp
443129,idesign,2010-03-13 00:28:00,149," I will try tomorrow to get better pictures.this tracks recently started showing up from last week.we never had that track before.BTW,we also left some frozen meat outside in box last week and half was gone.looks like something is coming to eat .note this is farming area.i will get back with new pic tomorrow morning.thx for reply"

443134,Ron,2010-03-13 00:30:00,1683,  Ya.....OK.....  Looks like premature woodpecker tracks if you know what I mean....
443135,LucG,2010-03-13 00:30:00,779,"Could be a fisher or a marten. They hop as a squirrel would, sometimes leaving marks similar to that pic. But with the melt, it is certainly anyones guess."
443140,bassman87,2010-03-13 00:41:00,586,pictures of the crap please
443144,Leecher,2010-03-13 00:44:00,7832,I'm guessing here..... but could be bear if you left meat outside but pretty hard to ID.  Leechman
443147,BIG FISH,2010-03-13 00:51:00,54,  no...... i dont know what you mean.....  care.......to explain.......

443186,Fisherman,2010-03-13 02:15:00,7201,Maybe ya should have waited another week and then we could tell by how far the grass is bent..
443201,Dara,2010-03-13 02:49:00,3052,  you mean a Polar Bear right?  I think the rest of em are still sleeping...up here anyway
443214,Leecher,2010-03-13 03:22:00,7832," No a black bear..... with the mild temps thus far, might have prematurely awaken some of them"
443218,Dara,2010-03-13 03:31:00,3052,  close but a bit early still in this neck of the woods...the one under my deck is still sleeping.....maybe not in his
443220,TerryC,2010-03-13 03:33:00,196,It's the ever elusive Reebok!   Clarence
443560,chickenhawk,2010-03-14 00:59:00,612,my first guess was a bear but you really cant tell....lets see the poo haha
