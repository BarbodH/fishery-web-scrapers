443600,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-14 02:33:00,10439,"Here's my latest.  Not as sweet as April though. This is a seat I'm building for my latest build, a Sage Z-Axis 7136-4 Spey conversion. The skeleton hardware is Struble nickel silver and the wood is dyed and stabilized spalted big leaf maple burl.  "
443602,BillM,2010-03-14 02:35:00,17367,"Dave, if I ever get sick of cork and sliding rings, I'll be giving you a call"
442575,solopaddler,2010-03-11 18:17:00,8605,"Dave (Drifter_016) just sent me this butt cap and matching winding check. Wood is cocobolo with the bottom part of the cap made from a hockey puck. The finish is incredibly smooth and shiny, like glass. I'm not 100% sure how Dave achieved the finish except I do know he used crazy glue and buffed it up.  Thanks buddy, very nice.  "
442579,Spiel,2010-03-11 18:21:00,9065,"Very nice work Dave. I've been at this so long I still can't believe I don't own a lathe of some sort for turning caps, reel seats and checks but it is on my need to get list.  So what new rod are you putting these on Mike?"
442580,solopaddler,2010-03-11 18:27:00,8605, 13' 3pc Rainshadow XST with a hand turned sliding ring handle.
442586,Harrison,2010-03-11 18:43:00,2202, That's goona look sharp!  I have a Hardy that would like one of those too... any extras?
442587,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-11 18:46:00,10439,Shiny enough for you Mike?
442590,Spiel,2010-03-11 18:51:00,9065," I think we discussed that handle, yes?"
442600,solopaddler,2010-03-11 19:10:00,8605," Ask Dave, he's taking orders.    No    Yep."
442622,TJQ,2010-03-11 19:50:00,7806,Nice!!
442649,vinnimon,2010-03-11 20:48:00,2593,"Nice Bud, I would love a custom add on on my 13 1/2 raven IM6 float rod.Any chance for a match up for the butt end?"
442651,highdrifter,2010-03-11 20:53:00,2534,"Oooh that's sweet.  April Vokey sweet.  Can I get one like that for the lamiglas??!  The one I have now is a little..  well, it's kind of..  pointy."
442679,solopaddler,2010-03-11 21:50:00,8605, You can achieve the same finish on the wood in your handle with multiple coats of gun stock oil and a lot of rubbing.
442738,Leecher,2010-03-11 23:54:00,7832,Great job Dave Awesome looking butt cap!!!
442741,irishfield,2010-03-12 00:00:00,26272,Guess the lad has to do something when he can't go outdoors up there...  How long did it take you to polish solo's knob Dave??
442760,misfish,2010-03-12 00:44:00,29133,"Im not a pinner,so what is a ""winding check""?  Real nice and shinny  Nice work."
442761,Paully,2010-03-12 00:53:00,712, LOL  .. Zing!
442765,Terry,2010-03-12 00:55:00,14456,The winding check protects the cork from chipping where it meets the rod and also provides a finish to the look of the rod
442768,misfish,2010-03-12 01:00:00,29133," Thanks Terry.  Im heading out this weekend down to the nottty on Sunday with my trusty ol spinner.Not sure if the ice has broke free yet here.  Oh BTW,I always knew you were a clown,but,,,,,,,,LOL"
442773,solopaddler,2010-03-12 01:14:00,8605,"  Hours and hours Wayne, the finish on my knob is incredibly tough and shiny. It's like blue steel man, a cat couldn't scratch it!!"
442777,danbouck,2010-03-12 01:30:00,4380, ... biting my tongue
442783,troutologist,2010-03-12 01:37:00,951,"  Yes good comparison.  I might try a little buffing on the cts, make mine Vokey sweet.   Nice work Dave."
442785,Dara,2010-03-12 01:51:00,3052,  so you put a bit of oil on your wood when you set to polishing it eh.  Turned out really nice. Is there a reason for the hockey puck other than looks? Possibly protecting the butt when you set it on the ground?
442843,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-12 05:51:00,10439,"  Just looks with this finish but when rubbing on oil you can leave it uncoated to act as a regular butt cap. If you were to coat it with stock finish it would crack and wear off quickly. The CA finish is much more durable than stock finish, varathane or rod finish.  Another reason for the puck is to finish off the butt cap. The wood is turned on a mandrel so there is a 5/16"" hole all the way through it. The solid piece of rubber is epoxied on when the wood part is finished. I then thread the wooden part to accept a short threaded mandrel to finish turning and finishing. You can't turn the wood piece on the short mandrel because it is only supported on one side and there would be too much deflection in the mandrel."
442936,highdrifter,2010-03-12 15:28:00,2534, That shouldn't be a problem.. my right arm is grotesquely oversized..  from casting!!
