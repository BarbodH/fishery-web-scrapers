442805,BillM,2010-03-12 02:37:00,17367,The start to a very nice spring I'm sure!   Good work bud...  I am really hating this new project at work   Takes up to much of my fishing time!!!
442813,Kinger,2010-03-12 03:02:00,351,Beautiful fish!!   i can't find any chenille like that for my jigs!
442830,okumasheffield,2010-03-12 03:56:00,318,Just when I thought all steelheaders keep their voice down while hammering them this season!
442835,Paulus,2010-03-12 04:23:00,522,"Thanks for sharing, Mike. I always like to see fresh pics of even fresher fish! That water looks pretty good, too. And hey! I think I recognize the handiwork in that male's mouth  p.-"
442903,fish_fishburn,2010-03-12 13:59:00,1311,"Nice pics Solo, Is that you new Paine FAlls reel? Sweet love the colour.  My new reel has to be anodized green, not into the bling bling. Thanks for sharing."
442907,solopaddler,2010-03-12 14:11:00,8605, No actually that's the Riverkeeper Frogwater. I'm meeting Adam and picking up the new Paines Fall next week.
443071,MJL,2010-03-12 21:42:00,2427,Well done Mike!  Great to see the reports back up
443073,douG,2010-03-12 21:45:00,2693,"Sweet, Mike.  A gorgeous fish."
443092,ehg,2010-03-12 22:46:00,2666,"ah,,spring is here"
443198,Moosebunk,2010-03-13 02:40:00,3970,Still icefishing here Mike. lol.  Kinda think I'd rather be doing what you're doing though...  Bring on the sun and fun ya say!!!  Nice catching.
443369,tibbs,2010-03-13 16:43:00,650,Great Report Solo!
442518,solopaddler,2010-03-11 15:07:00,8605,"It hasn't been a particularly bad winter here in southern Ontario, but for me it's been a long one. I have had the chance to get out steelheading a handful of times throughout the winter with decent success. The Niagara especially has coughed up a few brutes for me. Yesterday was special though as it was the first time I've fished in such warm spring-like temperatures with obviously bright fresh run fish. Spring is in the air folks! In addition I was finally able to hook up with John (FLEX ROD on the board). Once again the greatest thing about this board is the quality of its members and the new friends that you meet. It was a pleasure fishing with you yesterday John and I'm sure we'll do it again!  The water at our river of choice was running extremely high and slightly stained from spring runoff. This freshet pushed goodly numbers of steelhead into the system and provided almost perfect conditions. Fish were caught on a mix of brightly coloured jigs as well as the usual oversized roe bags tied in chartreuse.  Here's a few from yesterdays outing. With spring fully upon us and the weather cooperating there'll be a lot more of the same in next 2-3 weeks.             Cheers,  Mike"
442522,highdrifter,2010-03-11 15:18:00,2534,Dude...  You make us weekend warriors writhe with all your week day escapades!!  Very noice! HD
442525,troutologist,2010-03-11 15:23:00,951,Right on Mike. Good to see the steelhead pics again.    I've got to fish for them soon or I'm gonig to go crazy.
442526,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-11 15:23:00,0,sweet. yesterday was my last day out with the snowmachine (barring some sort of biblical snowstorm) so steelheading is near...  let's hope the superior tribs will cooperate.
442529,vinnimon,2010-03-11 15:28:00,2593,Beauty Bow Mike.
442532,Steel28,2010-03-11 15:36:00,160,nice going Mike!
442533,tonyb,2010-03-11 15:37:00,1637,"And so it begins...those poor mykiss don't stand a chance.  Great to see you your reports again Mike, hope we can share a drift again soon.  Boat comes out of hibernation on April 15th, let me know if you want to get out for some spring Kings.  Tony"
442540,Hairpy,2010-03-11 16:06:00,73,How was the traffic down there Mike ? I might stop by on sunday after visiting the inlaws.  Joseph
442542,strakey,2010-03-11 16:16:00,78,"Mike im not to sure how you do it but you are a steelhead magnet. They must leave every other river and gravitate to you when you go fishing, because my rivers arn't coughin up anything. Good first spring post"
442552,Spiel,2010-03-11 16:39:00,9065,"  Wow, now I know why you wanted that neon chartreuse thread with white trim on your new rod, it matches your fly perfectly."
442555,solopaddler,2010-03-11 16:42:00,8605,  Yeah right.  Don't you be messing with my thread colours now.
442557,icefisherman,2010-03-11 16:44:00,952,"So while I was closing ice season you were opening the soft water one. Way to go Mike. Great reports and love the pictures.... I can smell the season coming in....time to start getting the boat ready.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

442560,rock34,2010-03-11 17:00:00,215,I need to stop looking at your posts when I am at work...it makes me really unproductive the rest of the day as my mind dreams of dancing steelies on my line.  Great job!
442683,FLEX ROD,2010-03-11 21:58:00,394,"Mike, you coud not have summed it up any better, ""Once again the greatest thing about this board is the quality of its members and the new friends that you meet"".  Once again many thanks for the great day I had a blast and any time and you have space and paitience I will be ready.  Thanks,  John"

442764,archie_james_c,2010-03-12 00:55:00,618,I was just down at the local river tonight to try out my new Croix rod. First cast with a 2/5 oz. Cartreuse/Silver Cleo...BAM. 'Bow on! Made a little jump and shook his head at the same time...off the hook and gone   .  Should have never cheaped out and ran mono as opposed to my normal braid...
442799,Dozer,2010-03-12 02:19:00,896,"Spring starts when solopaddler starts reporting on steel... 'cause Chuck Norris said so  Nice fish, I cant wait to hook into more steel this season"
