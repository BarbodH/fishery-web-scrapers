791459,bigugli,2013-06-09 20:16:00,6138,i might be buying a sixteen foot boat with a pull start twenty five h.p. evinrude but im not sure how i would hook up a fishfinder\gps? is there a way to hook a battery to the motor to charge it or would i be stuck charging another battery to power my electronics?
791461,aplumma,2013-06-09 20:38:00,6896,Does the motor have an alternator?  I would think not since it is a pull start. The magneto is what provides the electricity for the spark and is not a charging source.  Art

791470,Bill Shearer,2013-06-09 20:47:00,456,"Have to charge the battery separate from the motor. Not really a big deal. Solar is always a possibility with what is now available. Draw is so minimal from what you listed, that you could probably go 5 days use with a regular battery before you had to think about any charging. High output battery would give you 7 full days, I'd bet. The solar panel would eliminate any doubt."
791477,davey buoy,2013-06-09 20:57:00,5505,Small gell battery and charger.Not much money and will run your fishfinder fine.
791492,Fisherman,2013-06-09 21:52:00,7201,"1, 2, 3...25, 26...hopefully you have good shoulders when it decides it doesn't want to start on the first or second pull."
791500,Bernie,2013-06-09 22:09:00,3190,Depending on the year some pull start 25's came with a charge outlet.

791507,express168,2013-06-09 22:45:00,327,"Took a fully charged deep cycle and used it to power my fishfinder in a rental boat for week last year, worked all week without the need for charging. There is very little draw from a fishfinder."
791600,GYPSY400,2013-06-10 09:49:00,191,"Small outboards charge very little anyhow.. Like 4A at full rpm.. You could run a deep cycle battery and solar or trickle charge it.. I run a ""trailer breakaway battery"" for my portable fish finder I got at princess auto for like $30. Another option is to install the charging system onto the motor.. If its a Johnson or evinrude I know they sell a kit to make the magneto charge for like $150, but like I said, you only get 4Amps."
791637,BillM,2013-06-10 13:13:00,17367, Do yourself a favour and get a motor with electric start..
791706,Sinker,2013-06-10 17:52:00,8692,"I don't see any need for electric start on a 25hp engine. I have a manual start 40hp, and my 11 year old son can start it up no problem. It helps if you maintain it, and have it running good.  I'd just get a small 7Ah gell battery to run the graph. It will run a graph all day no problem. You'll need a battery charger, but its a lot better than hauling around a 75lb deep cycle.  S."

791740,boombap,2013-06-10 19:52:00,310,"Get yourself a lawnmower battery from walmart. I run my garmin echo500 which is a colour screen and my bilge pump all weekend. It weighs about 20-25 pounds, charge it ASAP after every use and your good to go.  If it lasts you 2-3 seasons.. It did the job for $50"
791790,Rizzo,2013-06-10 22:28:00,4754,small gel battery is all I ever used when I had a pull start engine.
