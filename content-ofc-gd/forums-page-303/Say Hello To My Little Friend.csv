790508,Terry,2013-06-05 00:54:00,14456,nice  nothing like a new toy
790514,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-05 01:06:00,10439,"  Nope, I'm doing it."
790517,kickingfrog,2013-06-05 01:17:00,8333,"Glad you posted that second photo, cause without a prop that beast isn't going anywhere. Ice out yet up there?"
790522,Ron,2013-06-05 01:20:00,1683,Tiller model? LMAO.....
790523,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-05 01:20:00,10439,Ice is gone off the smaller lakes but still ice on the big lake.
790527,NAW,2013-06-05 01:28:00,4022,You must be pumped!
790537,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-05 01:41:00,10439, Understatement of the year.  Already have the new controls installed and will be installing the Mercmonitor Smartcraft gauge and Atlas jack plate tomorrow. After that I just have ot mount and hook up the engine.
790702,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-05 23:31:00,10439,"Right!!! Got the controls , Mercmonitor gauge and jack plate installed. Motor goes on tomorrow.  Between the original motor and the transom there was a spacer made of some kind of fiberboard. Needless to say it was in rough shape after 22 years on the back of my boat. I replaced it with a piece of 1/2"" Lexan that I painted the back side the same colour as the boat. This should last forever.      Got the jack plate bolted on after installing the Lexan spacer.      Still have to connect the Mercmonitor to my GPS as well as tidy up the console wiring and install some engine sensors after the engine is mounted. Waiting on steering wheel controls for trim and jack plate from BPS too."
790978,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-07 00:16:00,10439,"Got the motor mounted and the rigging mostly finished. Just need to make the connections to the motor, stick on a prop and PDI the motor then I should be ready to fire her up.  Got to admit it looks pretty bad   !!!       "
790993,Roy,2013-06-07 01:28:00,13728,Better get a transom saver on there pronto!
790996,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-07 01:38:00,10439, Been using one since I bought the boat in 1991. I won't trailer without one.
