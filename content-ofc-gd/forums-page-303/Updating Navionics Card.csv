Gold Canada maps. for Humminbird, I plug it in, it says I have 323 days left of free updates.  Great! So I go to update it, it says that there is not enough room on the card to perform the needed tasks  Is this a common problem?  I have requested help from Navionics regarding this, but that was late last night. I am hoping someone here has some insight on this. thanks  j"

778443,ecmilley,2013-04-09 12:52:00,2163,"never had that issue with my plat+ or hot maps cards, can't remember if you have to unlock them first to record data to them (little switch on the side)"
778444,blindjustice,2013-04-09 12:53:00,6,Yes it's a common problem.  Contact Navionics and they will send you a larger SD card.  You will have to send in your card first though.  Had the same issue in the Fall and they had a new 2 Gb card to me in a week.

791122,mistaredone,2013-06-07 18:38:00,913,"I had no idea that you could update the maps?  Thanks for the info guys, I'm going to try and update my Kawartha hot maps tonight."
791123,BillM,2013-06-07 18:40:00,17367,"Nice to have some Navionics representation on the board, lots and lots of guys use them. (Myself included)"
791639,RichNavionics,2013-06-10 13:20:00,22,"Don't also forget to update the software on your plotters as well. This is free and adds great new features. Lowrance has updated their Gen2 and Gen2 touch to add shallow water highlights, depth contour shading, rock filtering, and more. "
