790525,kickingfrog,2013-06-05 01:27:00,8333,Looks like I've missed the first few episodes of this season. Tonight's show is the Lake Champlain episode.
790526,nancur373,2013-06-05 01:28:00,1211,PVR buddy PVR....
790532,kickingfrog,2013-06-05 01:33:00,8333,"Already setup, but once a show is in reruns I delete the timer."
790542,nancur373,2013-06-05 01:53:00,1211,who is your provider? Bell there is an option where you can set to record only new episodes. It's pretty sweet
790550,pike slayer,2013-06-05 02:11:00,1177,just watched it. it was on sea lampreys. monsters yes. danger to humans i dont think so.i got one smelt fishing a few years back and it ended up on the highway.the show before that was awesome. he was catching 200lb tarpin in a little rubber tube.
790553,BillM,2013-06-05 02:18:00,17367,"Killer tarpon then lampreys...  I don't think he got a tarpon over 100lbs, lol.   Let's hope the show gets back to giant man eating fish and less of what we've seen the past two episodes."
790554,Sinker,2013-06-05 02:21:00,8692,"Yeah, I've had the new episodes on, but didn't really get into them. They were just kind of on as background noise.  S."
790560,kickingfrog,2013-06-05 02:45:00,8333,"There is a finite amount of ""monsters"" and most are more myth then anything, but for me the lamprey is the creepiest creature he's dealt with."
790570,Bassaholic,2013-06-05 03:27:00,74,Glad I'm not the only one...To me Lampreys look like something out of a sci-fi movie!
790571,Sinker,2013-06-05 03:29:00,8692,"I don't like those big stingrays he pulls out of nasty, dirty waters. I'm ok with lampreys, but those rays are gross!  S."
790610,Headhunter,2013-06-05 13:23:00,5703,"Thought last nights show was pretty lame, until he let the lamprey attach itself to his neck. It was at that point that I began to question the guy's sanity. And who knew that Lamprey could trun out to be the other other other other other other white meat!? HH"
790615,ccmtcanada,2013-06-05 13:50:00,7971, Yep...I wondered about his sanity when he went into a pool filled with piranha just to see if they'd eat him alive....LOL.
790780,Rich,2013-06-06 10:18:00,3927,I can't stand the 45 minutes of overdramatic interviews with locals.  Give me a real fishing show any day.
790821,BillM,2013-06-06 13:57:00,17367, Luckily for you this isn't a real fishing show.
790827,wkimwes,2013-06-06 14:14:00,76,"It's an awesome show, must remember to set it up!"
790940,bare foot wader,2013-06-06 21:41:00,1354,"  agreed, it's as much about the destination, travel and local myth as it is the fishing......one of my favourite shows going lately"
790952,davey buoy,2013-06-06 22:29:00,5505,"Love that show,the natives are my favorite part. Great to see other parts of the world where if you go down to the lake for a wash or swim,you may not come back!!!  .We just don't see these size fish/monsters here.!"
790979,Rich Clemens,2013-06-07 00:23:00,3131,I'm just upset that he was not able to catch the Lock Ness Monster ...  I wanted a good close-up of Nessie
791002,Moosebunk,2013-06-07 01:48:00,3970,Bell sattelite here?  What channel?    Living in dark age.
791004,nancur373,2013-06-07 01:53:00,1211,Discovery 520 regular 1602 HD
791006,Moosebunk,2013-06-07 01:56:00,3970,"Thanks... but hmph!!!  Not in one of our ""bundles."""
791075,mattyk,2013-06-07 14:10:00,2110,"I love the show. It's not just about the fishing, but the travel and local culture and story telling as mentioned above."
791139,davey buoy,2013-06-07 19:49:00,5505,Exactly!  .
791155,RJackson,2013-06-07 21:03:00,113,"Great show and like many have said, it's not a fishing show.  The bizarre locations and oddball style fishing it shows is intriguing.  He has an absolute savage on a rod though!  RJ"
791239,Rizzo,2013-06-08 13:09:00,4754,"I do enjoy the show, but wish he would keep it to more ""tropical"" destinations and unusual species. When he starts to talk about 6 foot killer pike and deadly tarpon it seems silly to me. Talk about some bizarre fish I've never heard of and I might believe that it could be dangerous."
