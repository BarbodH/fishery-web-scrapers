791372,Roy,2013-06-09 03:15:00,13728,"Wow! I had no idea there was a play by play going on here!  For me it was a great time with four friends. Aside from the excellent fishing, there were enough stories told by all that'll keep me laughing for another while."
791373,Joey,2013-06-09 03:16:00,9122,

790512,Roy,2013-06-05 01:05:00,13728,Hey Rick....I'm way past licensing age.  All I do is show them my old dude card that has my phone number on it in case I get confused and lost.
790519,Ron,2013-06-05 01:19:00,1683,"Call me nieve, but does that apply to a non resident as well? I assume you live in Quebec Roy so esentially you would be considered a non resident of Ontario no? Just curious...  Cheers, Ron..."
790529,RickOnt,2013-06-05 01:30:00,669,OK Now Ron is making it complicated!! However we should check.  I have a couple years to go before no more license!!  Rick
790530,Terry,2013-06-05 01:30:00,14456,thursday and sunday still open if anyone wants to get a group together
790535,dhickey,2013-06-05 01:36:00,1038,Can I just watch you guys in action? Then Im in Sat.. I wont even fish.
790540,Ron,2013-06-05 01:49:00,1683,"Sorry Roy.  just did a search....  A person is deemed to be the holder of a Recreational Fishing Licenceif they are:1. Residents of Ontario and Canada under 18 years old, or 65 years ofage or older and in possession of any licence, permit, certificate oridentification card issued by the Government of Canada or aprovincial or territorial government of Canada that indicates theirname and date of birth.  but still Roy, i thought you were older than 18.  i always thought of a non resident, as in not living in Ontario. (Thanks Lloyd)..."
790546,Terry,2013-06-05 02:01:00,14456,sunday still open if anyone wants to get a group together
790559,fishnsled,2013-06-05 02:44:00,3520,"Tried to put together a group but between surgery for one, family commitments, work etc, just not happening.  A great opportunity to learn from one of masters of Lake Ontario.  Don't miss out!!  I may have to put the boat in and stalk you guys on Saturday.  lol!  Have a great time gents!"
790603,misfish,2013-06-05 12:54:00,29133,"Ok Rick,check pm,you too Terry.  Roy,you coming down the Friday?"
790616,Roy,2013-06-05 14:04:00,13728,Yes me Brudder. I have to leave in the early evening of Friday...just after Montreal's rush hour traffic. Either grab a motel in Newcastle or sleep under the stars.  The weather is improving for Saturday.
