791423,oOmunkeyOo,2013-06-09 16:38:00,8,"Hi all,  I started fishing a few years ago and have been hooked since. Mostly I catch bass and pan fish and also went salmon fishing a few times.  I feel it is time to try something different. I want to learn how to catch muskies. Would anyone know any affordable muskie guides? It's more important to learn the basics of how to do it then actually catching one (although that would be a bonus of course )  Thanks in advance!"
791424,Terry,2013-06-09 16:40:00,14456,in what part of the world or ontario would you like to fish for for them
791428,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-09 17:03:00,535,"Yeah it would help a lot if you narrowed down the area you'd like to fish, plus how you'd like to fish them (troll or cast)."
791442,oOmunkeyOo,2013-06-09 18:44:00,8,Around 3hrs within the GTA would be ideal. Maybe the Kawarthas.  Would prefer casting over trolling.
