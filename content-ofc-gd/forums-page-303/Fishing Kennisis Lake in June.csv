I've spent a few weeks later in the summer on Redstone and never saw anything but small mouth. Tried looking for lakers down deep but never got a bite and I suspect this may have been due to the warm water in August(and me a newbie lake trout fisher). Whats the best way to try and get into the lakers during June?. Also what is the prospect of finding perch, walleye ect.. as bass season does not begin until the 22nd. Thanks for any help.  -Adam"

791106,boatdrinks,2013-06-07 17:33:00,11,"Thanks, I've got a few 3 way rigs ready to go. Have you had any luck with perch or muskie on Kennisis?"
791124,jimmer,2013-06-07 18:44:00,2730,I don't believe that there are muskie in Kennisis. I have heard of some walleye though.

791742,cityfisher,2013-06-10 20:00:00,959,Kenesis is hit and miss.. mostly miss... huge body of water... Def not the best lake in the area for fishing... for waterskiiing and jet skis maybe
791762,Sinker,2013-06-10 20:49:00,8692,"Should still be able to pick up lakers flatlining deep diving cranks. My go to is a TD9 taildancer. Let out a cast, and 3-5 good rips of line and you'll be down 15-20ft. If that doesn't work,  go bigger to get deeper. I've caught piles of lakers on. The #7 tail dancers as well. They only get down 15ft if your lucky!  S."
