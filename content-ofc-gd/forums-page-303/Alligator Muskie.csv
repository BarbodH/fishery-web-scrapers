790545,captpierre,2013-06-05 01:58:00,2521,"Finally got out today at the cottage on Pigeon.  Acceptible winds for a change.  Anyway a 24 inch 'eye on a large clown Husky Jerk in 3 ft of water near rocks.  Back she went.  Was 3pm in bright sun with a steel leader.  Not suppose to happen.  Did see, for the second time in my life, a decent ski cruising around like a gator with it's head and eyes above water.  About 20 yrds from me in about 15 ft of water.  After 30 seconds, a flip of the tail and it was gone  What are they doing when they do that.  Trying to warm up in the warmer surface water?  peter"
790548,mercman,2013-06-05 02:03:00,7054,"I understand that they are getting a look around to get better acquainted with thier surroundings. Also the surface water temps are higher, so they may be warming up to help thier digestion."
790551,pike slayer,2013-06-05 02:14:00,1177,could be going after bait fish swimming to the top and diving down after them and not even paying the slightest bit of attention to your offering. i'd seen big walleye do this and pike to.
790564,Pigeontroller,2013-06-05 03:14:00,2793,Watchin' you!
790580,Rich,2013-06-05 10:45:00,3927,I saw pike doing the same thing two days ago. I asked them why they were doing it but they never replied. I think they may have been spies.
790618,NAW,2013-06-05 14:07:00,4022, What a prick...
790631,jammer,2013-06-05 15:03:00,43,Have seen pike do this right under the ice...  Scares the crap out of ya...  Ambush from above would be my guess...
790634,JoshS,2013-06-05 15:46:00,729,I've seen pike do it twice. I think I'm sold on the theory that it has something to do with digesting a big meal.
790641,Jigger,2013-06-05 16:41:00,1237,Not sure if serious? I laughed either way...
790656,jedimaster,2013-06-05 19:09:00,3472,I have heard its to aid in digestion. I have seen them do this before on balsam. The whole head clean out of the water mouth wide open cruising in about 15 fow for about 50 yards or more.
790668,Rod Caster,2013-06-05 20:01:00,5784, hahaha same here. I dont' think a musky has any knowledge and/or care of the surface world. Useless he's  got land envy.
790677,Hooked,2013-06-05 20:11:00,891,"yeah, I've seen Muskie do that at Rice Lake.  Also have seen Pike do it as well in other lakes.  Definitely an odd site to see."
790709,mercman,2013-06-06 00:02:00,7054,"Truth is no one knows for sure, and after googleing it, this seems to be a common theory. I laffed too when i read it though"
790724,DundasSteelheader,2013-06-06 01:05:00,166,"I've seen salmon porpoise in rivers before, momentarily sticking their head out of the water. Don't know what the purpose of that would be other then looking up river? I have no idea."
790853,mercman,2013-06-06 15:38:00,7054,AHHH...YEE OF LITTLE FAITH
791059,Rich,2013-06-07 12:50:00,3927,Sounds like thats what the musky WANT you to think when they RISE UP AND TAKE THE POWER BACK!! lol
791101,Rod Caster,2013-06-07 16:48:00,5784,"Hahaha! They don't have periscope technology (luckily!), so I suppose they have to monitor the limbed surface dwellers somehow."
791109,muskymatt,2013-06-07 17:50:00,2608,"I had almost the same thing happen to me years ago on the Ottawa river near Shirleys bay. A bud an I were trolling and had not got a sniff if a Muskie. We decided to call it a day and had started to reel in the lines. I was trolling a spinnerbait and was reeling fast, the bait came to the surface and was skipping along to the boat. I turned around when the bait was about 20' behind the boat and saw this Muskie on the surface, head almost out of the water, chasing the bait. I stopped reeling and let the fish catch up. When it did, it just did an about face and with its head still out of the water, took off like a bat out of hell. It stayed on the surface for about another 30' or so. Was the weirdest thing fish related I've ever seen."
791125,GbayGiant,2013-06-07 18:47:00,1780,sucking air for it's air bladder. They need ballast to suspend after all.   cheers
791237,Rizzo,2013-06-08 13:04:00,4754,some stinky bass farted and they are getting their nose out of the water
