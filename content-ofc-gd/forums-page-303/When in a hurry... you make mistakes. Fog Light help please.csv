Decided to rewire lights etc. and add a rocker switch panel on the console for aux/fishfinder/USB 5V etc.  The original owner had a set of fog lights that he never installed so I thought no prob, just add to panel, nice and clean.  I'm totally embarrassed as in my hurry I forgot about the 55W bulbs.  The rocker panel has fuses inline (5A I think) and of course it blew immediately.   I slowly remembered a relay in the fog light package that I ignored!   Any boating/foglight instructions online? I have no instructions with it and will be hitting google but thought I'd ask the pros here. "

791271,Tybo,2013-06-08 17:10:00,1373,The first one is the way to go. It's better to fuse the switch seperate from the relay. 18ga for the lights and 22 for activation.
