791146,blaque,2013-06-07 20:28:00,2419,"Well, actually cheektowaga.  Im going to need a second job having a cabelas 5 minutes away from my home  Anyway, Im sure ill be passing many of you southern ontarionites' in the aisles next fall"
791149,porkpie,2013-06-07 20:39:00,2521,"Yep, heck if they won't put one here, I'll see you there!!!"
791152,solopaddler,2013-06-07 20:48:00,8605,Fantastic news!
791172,kickingfrog,2013-06-07 22:22:00,8333,"I know someone in Tonawanda who won't be impressed, but then again not much does."
791175,danc,2013-06-07 22:50:00,4677,Well that's strange. The Cabelas store that I most frequent in Owatanna Minnesota just added a buffalo to their early America mounted animal display. So I guess that I can say that there's a new Buffalo in Cabelas. How weird is that??
791210,Pigeontroller,2013-06-08 05:11:00,2793,I heard a rumor there's one being built in Niagara...
791218,wormdunker,2013-06-08 10:33:00,1711,I heard its going to be a Bass Pro located at the old Garden City Race track. near the Leons superstore.
791225,Sebastian,2013-06-08 12:04:00,208,Bass Pro is going to the super mall in Niagara on the Lake while Cabelas is going in near te Walden Galleria mall in Buffalo(where Bass Pro decided not to build and went to NOTL instead.)
791227,Marko,2013-06-08 12:15:00,854,Here is a stupid question Is there a reason why Cabelas havent built a warehouse and a store in GTA somewhere? Seems more logical then Buffalo.
791234,woodenboater,2013-06-08 12:54:00,2277,not Cabelas but BPS related. I heard that BPS wanted to open a store in Buffalo but there was serious opposition to it so they said adios. Was also something about being waterfront so they could have boats on the water etc.. Don't know the full story but sounds like a shortsighted move if true.
791236,wkimwes,2013-06-08 13:03:00,76,"I am not understanding why Cabelas hasn't setup shop here too.  Not that I don't like BPS, but Cabelas has stuff to offer that I'd be interested in too that BPS doesn't.  Plus healthy competition is good for us all."
791256,blaque,2013-06-08 15:14:00,2419,That there is pretty clever
791285,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-08 19:22:00,8243,"I am not understanding why Cabelas hasn't setup shop here too.  Not that I don't like BPS, but Cabelas has stuff to offer that I'd be interested in too that BPS doesn't.  Plus healthy competition is good for us all. . This is similar to a thread on the same subject a few months ago. As I said then I won't drive to Toronto unless I absolutely have to catch a plane.  Most folks from Burlington to the Niagara river agree even with the average bridge wait time it's not worth grinding through that TO mess. The new store's address is NOTL and is located at the east end of the Garden City Skyway where the old horse track was which most of us believe is St. Kitts."
791366,Pigeontroller,2013-06-09 02:24:00,2793,"I know there's a BPS going in at the new mall in NOTL.  Again, I heard a rumor there's a Cabelas being built somewhere between Hamilton and St.Catharines..."
791369,kickingfrog,2013-06-09 02:39:00,8333,And rumours  have had one being built in Barrie for the last few years.
791597,Stoty,2013-06-10 07:10:00,2910,When is the Buffalo Cabela's going to open?
791611,blaque,2013-06-10 11:50:00,2419,Scheduled to open next fall
791714,kickingfrog,2013-06-10 18:31:00,8333,Too bad it's not this fall. We've already made plans to go to another Bills game. First thing I did when I heard about this new one was see where it is in relation to Rich stadium and the Sabre's rink.
791717,blaque,2013-06-10 18:43:00,2419," Agreed, sooner the better. And you should only be about 15-20 minutes to the new cabelas from either the stadium or the FN center. Thats one of the upsides here, you can get just about anywhere in about 15-20 minutes lol."
791729,lookinforwalleye,2013-06-10 19:06:00,4399,I now have a excuse to visit Buffalo
791749,nexstar,2013-06-10 20:13:00,63,  I second that.
