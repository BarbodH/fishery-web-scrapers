I have a bunch of different colour and size worm harnesses and bottom bouncer weights, decent assortment of plugs and minnow baits, swim baits and twister tails (in white and yellow).  Anything else I need?  Any other colours twister tails recommended?  We will have worms and I will also bring some leeches.  Thanks!! Burt"

I like the Rapala Clackin' Rap for casting/covering water. Never really honed in on a specific twister color, but I like bright (like blue, yellow, white) for dark waters and also prefer using 4"" for walleye.  When the fish are slow, piggyback the jig/twister with a piece of worm.  Find rock points, shoals and get serious at around 7pm. Fish should be quite active right now."
