791517,GNODDY,2013-06-09 23:14:00,163,Hey Guys  Don't post here much as work and a baby have kepte busy the last year. Long story short I overnight travel a lot and am in huntsville quite often with nothing to do. Can anyone point me in a direction where I can shore fish there?

Also on your way to the Locks there is a public dock just past cemetery on the left where people fish for bass and pike.  Also have seen people fishing from public docks on main street behind Pizza Pizza.  Good Luck  Ian"
