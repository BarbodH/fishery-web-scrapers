791519,DRIFTER_016,2013-06-09 23:24:00,10439,Got her out for some on water testing and break in time for the new engine. Gotta say I'm pretty pleased so far. Need to do a bit of tweaking to the setup but it's almost where it needs to be. The Smartcraft gauge with troll control are the cats   !!!! With troll control you can vary the trolling speed 10 rpm at a time from 550 rpm to .................................. You can also set trolling speed by MPH/KPH if you have tricky or wavy cons.
