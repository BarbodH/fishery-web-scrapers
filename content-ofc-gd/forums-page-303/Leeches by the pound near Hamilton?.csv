791197,Burtess,2013-06-08 02:31:00,901,Anywhere to buy leeches by the pound around Hamilton?  By the dozen is too expensive for a week fishing trip!  Thanks!! Burt
791203,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-08 03:43:00,8243,Try one of the Asian markets on or around York Boulevard in Hamilton. I'm not kidding.
791204,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-08 03:49:00,8243,"Try one of the Asian markets on or around York Boulevard in Hamilton, I kid you not. Bring a picture of a leach, there are language barriers when I shop for things at these markets often.  OOps."
791224,gaspumper,2013-06-08 11:42:00,393,"You are only allowed 120 in your possession at anyone time,a pound would be over that."
791238,Christopheraaron,2013-06-08 13:05:00,3525,"hmmm, what if you could split them between a few friends though?"
791283,Burtess,2013-06-08 18:48:00,901," Exactly...... seems to be common to buy them this way on-line in the USA, but can't find anything in Canada.  Burt"
