791594,Stoty,2013-06-10 06:45:00,2910,"Hey all,  My wife and I are planning a camping/fishing trip to one of the parks surrounding Sudbury in July. We'd like to stay within an hour(ish) drive as we have family in Sudbury that will be coming to visit us.  Being the hardcore fisherman I am... fishing is the #1 criteria for me and the choice of parks will be made on that. I'm interested in: - Bass - Walleye - Pike/Musky  The three parks that we're debating between are: - Halfway Lake - Windy Lake - Fairbank  Any info on these parks/lakes would be much appreciated. I have been told by another member on the board that Halfway Lake is worth the extra 40 min drive. Any other people agree?  Cheers and thanks in advance for any help! "
791599,GYPSY400,2013-06-10 09:40:00,191,"For convienience I would choose Windy Lake.. The bass and lake trout fishing are as good as Fairbanks, but the road getting there is way better.. I've never fished on halfway lake, so I can't comment on that."
791622,bow slayer,2013-06-10 12:30:00,1074,"I did some research myself on this, I ended up booking a couple days at Wakimi and then a few more at Halfway in july. By all accounts the fishing seems to be better at halfway with less traffic then Windy or fairbanks."
791624,capt_hooked,2013-06-10 12:32:00,212,there are also a few private parks in the Sudbury area.. that give you good access to fishing....
791642,Stoty,2013-06-10 13:38:00,2910,"Thanks for some great feedback!  Capt - I'm def open to suggestions. As long as they have nice washrooms (ladies coming) and hydro, I can handle the rest. I'd love to hit some Walleye/Bass. Any recommendations?"
791648,Dave Bailey,2013-06-10 14:04:00,1641,"I seem to recall that Halfway Lake is one of the parks that has gone non-operational, you might want to check."
791650,Dave Bailey,2013-06-10 14:08:00,1641,"Just checked, Halfway isn't on the list. I was probably thinking of Ivanhoe."
791670,torco,2013-06-10 15:22:00,656,"My wife and I stayed at Halfway lake a few years ago, didn't do much fishing but I hear it is decent. The rest of the park seemed clean and well maintained, we enjoyed our short stay. Just 2 nights and did some hiking."
791754,capt_hooked,2013-06-10 20:25:00,212,"Capt - I'm def open to suggestions. As long as they have nice washrooms (ladies coming) and hydro, I can handle the rest.I'd love to hit some Walleye/Bass. Any recommendations?   I have a good friend runs this place:  www.lakair.com  Only transient camping,  good docks... marina and great fishing...  walleye, bass, pike and musky A small clean park.. very clean washrooms water and hydro at each site."
791760,woodenboater,2013-06-10 20:38:00,2277,and that wall tent set up is pretty sweet huh Capt H   I won't be bringing my tent on the next trip up
791764,solopaddler,2013-06-10 20:56:00,8605,"French River PP, downstream from hwy 69 is where I'd go, launching at Hartley Bay. All the sites are water access and obviously there's no services, but the scenery is spectacular as is the fishing for walleye, pike, musky and bass. It's precisely 1 hour south of Sudbury."
791902,Stoty,2013-06-11 08:54:00,2910,"Thanks Solo, however services are a must on this trip. I'll def keep that in mind for a ""guys"" weekend though!"
791903,Stoty,2013-06-11 08:59:00,2910," Thanks for the suggestion, I'll check it out."
791906,solopaddler,2013-06-11 09:05:00,8605," Bear in mind you can camp close to the marina if you want, they have everything you might need there.  http://www.hartleybaymarina.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=5"
