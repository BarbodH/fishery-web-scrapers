791468,RickOnt,2013-06-09 20:46:00,669,"A ""Fantastic Day"" with some great people and an excellent Captain who really knew what He was doing and operated like a fine tuned machine.  Setting out an 8 Rod spread and putting us on Fish!!  He was also very patient when he requested 'a little right' and then had to follow up with 'No the other Right'!!  And answered my non stop questions!!!LOL  The Coho is going on the BBQ very soon. Dinner is gonna be good!  Thanks for a 'Fun' day  Rick"
791481,Sinker,2013-06-09 21:06:00,8692,Good stuff boys! Looks like a fun day for sure!  Let's hear some details......how deep? How far down? What colours? Spoons? Flies? Dipsies? Riggers? Sooo many questions  S.
791483,Handlebarz,2013-06-09 21:16:00,3790,Looks like one heck of a great time and nice water to be out on Congrats guys
791604,fishhunter,2013-06-10 10:59:00,604,"It was so nice to have the four of you out. Great report and pics. One of the first thing i said after we were under way was I put those track pants on because i knew someone would say something  lol they have been put away for awhile but had to bring them out just for you.  Its always nice when you can spend the day on the water with 4 great guys. Some may have to learn right from left but i'm sure thats something that still can be learned Someone forgot some jigs on my boat. Just pm me mailing address and ill send them out asap.  Now as for what was working, everything. Every set up took a hit. 10 rod spread. 6 core 2 dipsy 2 riggers."
791606,Roy,2013-06-10 11:08:00,13728,I think the jigs are Brian's.

791441,Leecher,2013-06-09 18:26:00,7832," Nice video Terry and good choice of tunes    Next time instead of speeding up the vid, cut out what you don't want your audience to see and use the side swipe effect from left to right... imo it's a more effective way than speeding it up  Looks like fun times!  bet there was some good stories telling between the bytes Jacques"
791458,misfish,2013-06-09 20:13:00,29133," Lets just say,we kept the, CPR pics to our selves.LOL"
