791184,grt1,2013-06-08 01:27:00,638,today I went out scouting for walleye and to give my boat it's first run of the year. I got a surprise catch at one of my usual walleye spots when I drifted over the reef I got this 17 1/4 inch bass. Now this is a surprise catch since gullrock is not supposed to have smallmouth in it. over the years I've caught several small rock bass but this baby was really a lunker  
791185,danc,2013-06-08 01:35:00,4677,Nice! I'll be in Red Lake in a week or so. What a great place to spend the summer.

791199,grt1,2013-06-08 02:56:00,638,that was the first smallmouth I've caught since I was a preteenage kid when I grew up in Brantford and fished the Grand river at the end  of our block

791307,ehg,2013-06-08 21:57:00,2666, Hard to believe but bass season opens down here (FMZ 17) next weekend.   Almost seems that smallmouth could be seen as an invasive species on Gullrock L. there.  Nice catch though.
