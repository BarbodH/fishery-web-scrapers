766924,wantabigone,2013-02-11 17:35:00,97,"Hello all. Are there any individual fishermen out there that would like to join our group of 3 at Richter lake for walleye? Pike too!  We are a group of low key fishermen, (we do not wake at the break of dawn to fish and fish until the sun sets), Not hard drinkers, aged 80, 70ish and 45.  If anyone in interested we are located in Toronto, driving to Nakina the third week of June. Leaving June14th and likely back in Toronto June 23rd.  If interested send me a PM!"
766934,solopaddler,2013-02-11 18:30:00,8605,"Hopefully someone steps up, Richter is a good one for sure. Still regret not making that trip myself a couple falls ago.  Speaking with Eddie recently he'll be doing a bunch of improvements to the camp as well.  Cheers"
767326,wantabigone,2013-02-12 20:23:00,97,So then come with us Mike and then you will have no more regrets!
767332,solopaddler,2013-02-12 21:03:00,8605, Already have 5 trips booked for this year one of which is at the exact same time.  If I could I'd love to.
767574,SirCranksalot,2013-02-13 17:36:00,3291,"What, just 5 trips?? Yep, things are tough all over!  (didn't realize you were semi-retired?!)  Never been to Richter? And here I thought you were the Hank Snow of the fishing world!"
767672,yakpiker,2013-02-14 01:44:00,160,I fished the Attawapiskat with this guy a couple of years ago.  He was a stranger then...now he's a fishing buddy.  You will have a great time fishing with his group.  I'll be on Beteau the same week.
767779,hoops12,2013-02-14 14:53:00,127,"I have fish Richter before and if you like 22"" walleye every other cast, this is your lake!!"
768358,wantabigone,2013-02-17 03:01:00,97,It sounds like a fun lake to fish Hoop. It is why we decided on this lake. Did you guys look for big pike? If so - any luck?
768402,lookinforwalleye,2013-02-17 14:30:00,4399,"Not really a trophy pike fishery  the week our group was there if memory serves there was maybe 2 or 3 pike over 35"" caught largest being 38.5"". The pike fising is better in the Toronto harbour."
770320,hoops12,2013-02-26 17:04:00,127,"We got a ton of smaller pike as well, the biggest was 42"".  It's not a trophy pike lake but the number of fish caught in a week is amazing"
770326,wantabigone,2013-02-26 17:28:00,97,"Thanks hoops... 42"" is a mighty fine pike in my books. Could you PM me on where abouts you found the bigger pike? I hear there is a weedy section west of the cabin. Is this an area you found the bigger pike?  I really am itching for June to get here."
770328,kickingfrog,2013-02-26 17:41:00,8333,"It's a small enough lake that you can fish the whole thing in a week if you want to. The bulk of the weeds, and bigger pike, are in the bottom end of the lake near/past the island.  I don't remember a spot that didn't produce fish. We would decide to troll back to the cabin for lunch. We would just head straight for the cabin and have stop because we were catching fish so often that we would have never made it."
770336,wantabigone,2013-02-26 17:59:00,97,Thanks for the heads up. I am sure we will be having alot of fun with the numbers. I certainly hope I can locate some of the bigger pike.  Tight lines all
770346,BillM,2013-02-26 18:38:00,17367," Sounds like the problem isn't the fish.....   Comparing Richter to Toronto Harbour, lol!"
770365,lookinforwalleye,2013-02-26 19:58:00,4399,I don`t think the problem was with the fishermen although that lousy fishermen Ben Beattie couldn`t catch a big pike to save his life that week!!!  just kidding Ben!!!  And although the Toronto comment does sound kind of funny I don`t think its that much of a stretch...maybe it was just a bad week for all six guys!!!
770396,solopaddler,2013-02-26 22:16:00,8605,Richter is a walleye factory with few equals but it's not a destination for trophy pike.
791446,wantabigone,2013-06-09 19:24:00,97,"Well, unfortunately mother nature conspired to keep us out of Richter this year. Due to weather conditions Eddie has been unable to have the camp ready for our June 15th departure.  Here's hoping everyone has a good season this year with great new memories and experiences."
791526,RickOnt,2013-06-09 23:30:00,669,So Where are you going now?  Rick
791806,wantabigone,2013-06-10 23:16:00,97,"Ogoki Lake with Ogoki Lake outfitters. Nice cabins and boats. Fishing is quite good for walleye, I have difficulty finding pike there however we have caight a 46 incher while fishing for walleye.  This will be my third time there and luckily they had an opening."
791809,BillM,2013-06-10 23:29:00,17367,"Wow, you'd think by June 15th things would be in full swing."
