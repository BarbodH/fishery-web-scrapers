Last year My GF saved the day last minute with an 8 lbs Pike use a little Cleo Spoon, I heard about it all year long!  This year we book the trip with a few hour s before we left. She was pretty pissed I left it that long, but I'm pretty sure we got the best damn site in the park. Corner lot on the water right near the bathrooms,procrastination pays off!  So Back to fishing, she is reading and we are miles from the park. I've stumbled into some pretty decent weeds and tell her this might be a good place to start fishing again. A few cast later she, I see her tugging on something like she is hung up. I give her the ole you got something, she says not sure. I watched for a couple seconds just looked like dead weight to me. I was going to take the rod and try to ripe though the weeds I assumed she had. Just before I was about to ask for the rod I saw something slowly raising. So after 15 minutes, with her stupid red Cleo spoon, 8 lb bread, no wire liter, or net we get this thing into the boat.  We paddled to the nearest dock to take pics and get er back int he water. It was pretty beat up, so I didn't try any rough measurements. Any idea on what the length and weight might of been? She seemed pretty thick to me not a thin as some muskies ive caught in the past.  So there wasn't any fish for dinner, but main concern is what will the taunting be like  this year! "

791484,Djeep,2013-06-09 21:22:00,199,"Congrats to your GF! Looks like a mid 40s fish that could be up to 20lb but likely a little less.  A net is a good thing to have when fishing balsam, try not to rope em up next time but everyone learns with experience."

791521,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-09 23:25:00,535,"Very nice fish, big head on it! I'd say it's closer to 50"" than 45.Can hardly fault a person for not having a net big enough to land a fish that size when they don't target musky, they're not exactly cheap and would take up a lot of space in a canoe."
791545,Rich Nelson,2013-06-10 00:42:00,332,Nice fish! Id say 46
791551,Rizzo,2013-06-10 00:59:00,4754,Zoinks! Nice fish. Maybe 47 or 48? Either way its a beauty
791553,Cloudy15,2013-06-10 01:07:00,141,"Thanks everyone, sounds like its between 44 and 50. With that being said, when people ask how big it was I am going to go with 56 and hmm 44 lbs?"
791554,Moosebunk,2013-06-10 01:09:00,3970,Doesn't matter the length ya give it today cause in 40 years it'll be double. lol  Congrats Cloudy.  Fine muskie for the Missus and yerself dood.
791592,mike rousseau,2013-06-10 06:15:00,4661,"I'd say its pushing 50""... Maybe 47""-48""...  How tall are you... 6 foot?"
791691,Cloudy15,2013-06-10 16:27:00,141,"6 foot I am , Thanks for the guess"
