791222,HTHM,2013-06-08 11:03:00,4082,"Include any identifying numbers, hull id number, serial number of the motor, etc."
791223,gaspumper,2013-06-08 11:29:00,393,"A bill of sale for the boat,one for the motor ,and one for the trailer,each one includes there own serial number."
791252,kickingfrog,2013-06-08 14:30:00,8333,"I would also have a separate bill for any other stuff. Trolling motor, batteries, fish finder etc."
791259,BillM,2013-06-08 15:31:00,17367," What's the point of this?  Trailer, motor, boat are all that you need."
791264,glen,2013-06-08 16:13:00,2641,Merry her quick before she leaves with the boat.  Wait what was the question?
791267,kickingfrog,2013-06-08 16:31:00,8333,   Legitimate way of lowering the taxes paid on buying used.
791273,Tybo,2013-06-08 17:18:00,1373,Since you are buying used.The bill of sale should be lower price than the cost.
791287,bow slayer,2013-06-08 19:35:00,1074,"the only thing you will have to pay taxes on is the boat,so get a seperate receipt for the motor...for example  for someone I know the break down was like this ,3500 for boat and trailer and then 6000 for the 2 motors. they  had to only pay taxes on the boat portion......plus the bills were lower than the cost. as mentioned above"
791288,kickingfrog,2013-06-08 20:18:00,8333,Taxes are paid on the trailer when you get (or transfer) the plates as well.
791343,ah_long,2013-06-09 00:16:00,354,"this would make your life a lot easier  straight from transport canada's website  http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/marinesafety/billofsale-actedevente-eng.pdf  Right beside engine details, I would hand write and add the following  Trailer details: Brand: Year: VIN: Color:  And in the price, write this down: $xxxxx (boat price) $xxxx (trailer price)  Warranty period just put as is  rmb to print two, one for you and one for the other party"
791370,BillM,2013-06-09 03:04:00,17367,"Legitimate way of lowering the taxes paid on buying used.   That's why the Boat + motor take up most of the price, the trailer is the cheapest"
791588,Cudz,2013-06-10 04:50:00,2652,You still have to pay taxes on the boat.  It took them almost 3 years to send me a tax bill for my boat.  The trailer tax is immediate.  I think Rob is itemizing so that when the time comes to pay tax on the boat he will save.
