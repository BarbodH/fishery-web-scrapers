790658,Henricus,2013-06-05 19:13:00,118,Does anybody have any experience with the alleged Hutcheson Beach boat launch in Hunstville (Lake Vernon)?  I might be looking to launch there in the coming weeks and was curious of the condition of the launch.  Apparently there is one there but I can't seem to find on google satellite. Thanks in advance. Rick 
790667,Freshtrax,2013-06-05 19:59:00,2215,It's there...if its the one I'm thinking of its in town then you have to run up the narrows to the lake...decent gravel ramp when I was there years ago no dock that I can remember
790670,beagle dad,2013-06-05 20:05:00,224,yes its there just east of hwy 11 south side of bay..u will have to go under 11 to get to the lake little park launch is fine
790671,misfish,2013-06-05 20:06:00,29133,"Theres a dock,watch for nails. If you launch there,you can go to   Vernon or Pen. Pen can be a fun lake to fish."

790685,Henricus,2013-06-05 20:53:00,118,"Thanks for all the replies but something tells me everybody is referring to the Avery beach launch on the east side of 11.  I am referring to the west side of 11 on the north shore of Vernon.  Apparently there is a launch, and this is an assumption, at the end of Hutcheson Beach road.  Is anybody familiar with this one?  Again, thanks for all comments so far. Rick"
790690,beagle dad,2013-06-05 21:35:00,224,never seen 1 there
790695,misfish,2013-06-05 21:58:00,29133," Ya I only know the one just as you get into town (left down the hill to the beach launch),and the other thats in town."
790711,steelhedrmatt,2013-06-06 00:07:00,278,"hutcheson beach launch is just west of the OPP station at muskoka rd 2.  turn left at hutcheson rd.  VERY shallow launch.  last time I was there my truck was in the lake about 20-30 yards to get the boat off the trailer.  If you have a big boat, I would suggest the one in town and run the narrows to the lake."
790763,Henricus,2013-06-06 06:55:00,118,"Solid info, thanks all."

791235,Dave Bailey,2013-06-08 12:55:00,1641,"I was at the Hutcheson Beach Road launch yesterday, just drove to the end of the road and then turned around. There seems to be some construction going on in the parking lot so if there's any activity ask the guys where you need to be to stay well out of their way."
791247,adempsey,2013-06-08 13:52:00,1498,Is this it at 1:50 ?  
791249,Dave Bailey,2013-06-08 14:10:00,1641," Yup, dat be da place. The construction, or maintenance, or whatever, is going on to the left of the ramp in that shot."
