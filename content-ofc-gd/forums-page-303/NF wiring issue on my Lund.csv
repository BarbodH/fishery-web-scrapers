791241,fishindevil,2013-06-08 13:12:00,6254,Anyone around in the sturgeon lake area can give me a hand with a wiring issue?? My bilge pump is not working and I have power to switch but seems when I had the timer on my livewell pump replaced they fed into another wire?? I don't have all the testers and stuff myself !! Heck not even sure about that !!!! Lol....and I did find a corroded small broken wire but it doesn't seem to come off the bilge pump ??  An electrician I am not
791243,fishindevil,2013-06-08 13:15:00,6254,And of course we could go for a fish out on the lake !!!!
791257,Parnelly,2013-06-08 15:18:00,108,Have you checked for continuity through the switch? Check for power at the pump itself when the switch is on. Could be the switch a wire or the pump itself. How old is the bilge?
791280,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-08 18:30:00,8243,"I'm the kind of guy that had to call the electricians to change the batteries in my flashlight at work. Just this year when I replaced the battery my bilge no longer worked. Forgot to put the wires onto the battery posts, they were jammed somehow below the battery tray. Sometimes it's the silliest things. Possible?  Yes I towed the boat into Don Hyde marine to have them check it out, took them a record 2 minutes, no charge just a good laugh."
791300,fishindevil,2013-06-08 21:18:00,6254,Pump is 2006 came with my boat  and it now seems bilge is shot ?? I think ...thanks for the info I will check
791302,fishindevil,2013-06-08 21:21:00,6254,Ya I hear you there iron maker !!! We have all had those moments including my fair share !!!! Well I took it to my dealer to get it fixed I gave up on it so it will be fixed regardless so it's all good thanks
791323,workwear,2013-06-08 22:48:00,592,just changed the bilge pump on my lund...35 dollars for the cartridge....but boy was it a pita....  dont you have two bilge  pumps on your lund??...one manual the other auto?..
791327,Terry,2013-06-08 23:26:00,14456,"are  they not the same one , just a switch to run it auto or manual"
791329,fishindevil,2013-06-08 23:35:00,6254,No I only have one bilge on my boat ...and beside it it's my livewell intake pump !!! Yes it's a pain to get down in there as well . I got the switch for the bilge tested and it's ok might be a bad ground in the fuse block ???
791330,workwear,2013-06-08 23:35:00,592,on my lund terry they are separate....2 bilge pumps....  one manual one auto ...great feature when dockin the boat over nite on the water...   im thinking it could be a time for a new pump
791342,Terry,2013-06-09 00:14:00,14456,"it is cool to have 2, I will have to check my lund when it shows up this week...(touch wood)"
791378,mike rousseau,2013-06-09 03:48:00,4661,I would cut the wire coming from the pump and touch the wire directly to a battery... That'll tell you if your pump is dead (usually the problem)... If by chance it runs doing this you simply put male/female connections where you cut (male on pump end... female on wire going to the switch) and troubleshooting is easier next time...
