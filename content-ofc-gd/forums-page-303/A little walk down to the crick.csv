The stream does have brookies, browns and the odd resident rainbow but the section within walking distance for a 4 year old is somewhat less then ideal. I figured we'd at least walk in some woods and maybe see some animal tracks.  He's not ready for fly casting but I figured the single action reel would simplify things a bit for him.    After trying a few spots we finally hit scales. A few chub were all we found but it was short, simple, completed without tears and we were home before 8:30am so hopefully it will be the first of many.  "

791427,ehg,2013-06-09 16:53:00,2666,That is awesome! Your son should remember that forever. I  remember my father talking me to local creek 40 yrs. ago  for perch and bullheads like it was yesterday.
