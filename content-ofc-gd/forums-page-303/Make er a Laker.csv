We started with jigging but no luck, the fish just weren't moving to the jigs like we hoped. So trolling was next, and it was awesome.  We went 5 for 7 with a couple dandy fish. All fish were caught in 55-65 fow with a 1.5mph troll. Silver and copper first but we had to switch to just silver after a while.  The bite was consistent, marking them moving on the downrigger ball meant a strike was going to happen. Here's three, the fourth fish pic wasn't taken due to a gill hook and blood everywhere, we were in cleanup mode.  The fifth, and a really nice Laker was immediately released( no pic) because we had our limit.    Me with a decent starter!    Brian with a little guy, prime for the smoker!  "
