981349,chris.brock,2016-09-11 22:22:00,4053," We went to Dave Lake. What a crappy name for a fly in lake or any other lake for that matter (nothing against you guys named Dave),but an Ojibway name for a lake is more appealing in my opinion.  It's on Mike's site  http://www.canadafishingguide.net/dave-lake-outpost-an-algoma-country-gem/  Here's some teaser giant fish pics        "
981350,Terry,2016-09-11 22:32:00,14456,good report looks like  Dave has some nice fish hooked neck    looked nasty
981358,ckewley,2016-09-12 01:55:00,699,"Read this last night, awesome!  Love the ""you're buggered"" !"
981359,OhioFisherman,2016-09-12 02:21:00,6623,Great pictures and ouch!
981361,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-12 05:44:00,8243,"A trip that brings back some great memories. Thanks, and never leave the dock without good bolt cutters just in case.  I had to laugh at the pics of the grey bearded gentleman with the Tilly hat. He didn't really look like he was very happy to show off his Walleye or happy to be there."
981372,adempsey,2016-09-12 13:40:00,1498,Nice looking camp!   Sounds like you guys had a decent trip.   Thanks for the report.
981389,Jds63,2016-09-12 19:32:00,1365,Great report Chris! I was trying to get in a September fly in but couldn't find anyone to go ... So reading the reports is better than nothing ... ???
981390,jimmer,2016-09-12 19:49:00,2730,I was going to say that was a weird place for a piercing.  Looks like a great trip! Thanks for sharing.
