981082,grt1,2016-09-06 19:19:00,638,"a buddy of mine gave me 2 gallon jugs of mercury 2 stroke engine oil. the store he purchased them at had them on a display that said it was opti oil, and he figured the opti engines are 2 stroke so this should be good to go.  but, the oil i always buy says opti oil right on the jug, not 2 stroke.  so my question is , to those who know such things , if i use this as my opti engine oil , will i screw my 150 hp opti. or should i save it to mix with gas for my 20 hp motor?  any and all comments and advice gladly accepted"
981084,Joeytier,2016-09-06 19:25:00,3990,"I would stick to using Opti oil, it's OPTI-mized (hah) for those engines."
981086,Garnet,2016-09-06 19:41:00,2056,Your 2 stroke oil is likely blue in colour and the opoti is black with a goldish brown.  If you get into a warranty thing with merc the factory will ask what colour the oil is and even a sample. Sell the 2 stroke and move on.
981088,fish_fishburn,2016-09-06 19:53:00,1311,I think it would be fine.
981090,G.mech,2016-09-06 20:02:00,830,If it has TCW-3 certification on the label it is okay for the Opti.  It think the only oils Merc sells with that rating are the Optimax oil and Premium Plus which are both synthetic blends.  I wouldn't use regular 2 stroke oil in the opti.
981093,John Bacon,2016-09-06 20:32:00,3277,I think an Optimax requires low ash oil.  I am not sure whether or not your oil would be low ash.  Considering the cost of a jug or oil vs. the cost of a new motor; I would give it to someone with a traditional two stroke and buy the proper oil.

The last I heard (years ago) is that all 2 cycle oil is now ""low ash"" oil."
981177,grt1,2016-09-08 13:00:00,638,"i picked up the oil yesterday, it was the premium plus oil and it says on the jug it is for oil injection and is rated better than the tcw3 . so I guess i'll use it but maybe i'll mix it with the expensive opti oil"
981179,John Bacon,2016-09-08 13:36:00,3277," i picked up the oil yesterday, it was the premium plus oil and it says on the jug it is for oil injection and is rated better than the tcw3 . so I guess i'll use it but maybe i'll mix it with the expensive opti oil   Oil injection does not mean Optimax.  Virtually all 2 stroke outboards over 40 hp (and smaller ones too) built in the 35 years have oil injection.  They are not all Optimax."
981181,DanD,2016-09-08 14:36:00,2223,Use it or not but don't mix the two. The chemical packages in the two may cause each other to break down or separate? I'm no chemist but working as a machanic I know some additives don't mix.  Dan.

According to that link Premium Plus is not OK for Optimax.  Only the DFI Outboard Oil is OK for Optimax and I would recommend only using DFI Outboard Oil in Optimax motors."
981239,John Bacon,2016-09-09 20:20:00,3277," According to that link Premium Plus is not OK for Optimax.  Only the DFI Outboard Oil is OK for Optimax and I would recommend only using DFI Outboard Oil in Optimax motors.  That's not the way I read it.  The chart indicates that Premium is 'Not recommended'.  Premium Plus is listed as 'Better'; while DFI is listed as 'Best'.  I would think that an oil listed as 'Better' as OK.  However, if I had paid for a new 150 hp Opti, I would go with the 'Best' and give or sell the Premium Plus to someone a traditional two stroke."
981246,grt1,2016-09-10 02:07:00,638,i guess i'll take the safe route and keep with the opti oil and use the other on my 20 hp .
981247,G.mech,2016-09-10 11:45:00,830," According to that link Premium Plus is not OK for Optimax.  Only the DFI Outboard Oil is OK for Optimax and I would recommend only using DFI Outboard Oil in Optimax motors.  The table at the bottom seems pretty clear, not sure how you could possibly draw this conclusion.  Anyway, like the others, I only put Opti oil in mine whether it's really necessary or not."
981248,Terry,2016-09-10 11:47:00,14456,"lets see , merc recommends their expensive  oil yet many other oils meets or exceeds all warranty requirements  hmmm what to do"
