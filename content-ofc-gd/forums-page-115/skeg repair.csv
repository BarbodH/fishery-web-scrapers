980853,bow slayer,2016-09-01 04:13:00,1074,"Well yesterday morning I pulled a bonehead move and broke off some of my skeg.  I was up at Restoule PP and got up before everyone else and checked the weather out and seen there was thunderstorms heading that way. So I decided I would take the boat out so I could start packing up since we were headed home that day. The lake was calm so I decided to go for a small ride before I took it out then back to the dock. I backed the truck and trailer down the ramp,then jumped in the boat and drove it on the trailer. This was the first time in about 6 or 7 years I had done this unassisted,usually one of my sons (who were both still asleep in the tent) drive the boat on the trailer and I just back up the  trailer and wait for them to load it. Well after loading it I jumped in the truck and drove up the ramp completely forgetting to trim up the motor,so now I am missing the bottom couple inches of the skeg.  No damage at all or near the gears just the lower section of skeg.  So now I need to find somewhere in the London area or realatively close by to get it repaired. Anyone have a suggestion,or even better a rough idea how much this going to cost?  Any help is greatly appreciated. thanks"
980854,Dabluz,2016-09-01 04:34:00,701,Any welding shop can fix this.  Should cost between 40 and 80 dollars.

980904,mistaredone,2016-09-01 21:32:00,913,City X 3. They did great work for me at a reasonable price
980923,ecmilley,2016-09-02 02:57:00,2163, This is the repair i made
981067,Sour_Squirrel,2016-09-06 10:38:00,196,What kind of engine and hp ? If you're interested I have a stainless steel skeg guard just like the one in the picture above.  It's for a 75-90 hp Johnson/Evinrude  Let me know if you're interested in it.
981099,captpierre,2016-09-06 22:46:00,2521,I took a 2x2 inch off the corner of my skeg. Fixed it myself with JB Weld Epoxy Putty. Sanded the edge of the broken edge rough. Overlapped a bit. Applied it. Cut it to shape with a hacksaw and sanded/filed smooth. Has stayed on for three years now. Marina wanted to take lower unit off and drain the oil before welding. I think quote was over $200.
981196,bow slayer,2016-09-08 17:49:00,1074,"yes I am interested, I have a 70 hp 4 stroke Johnson,wondering if it would fit?"
981212,fishermccann,2016-09-08 22:31:00,655,"X2 on the JB weld, 6 years later and it is still holding on, not bad for a 10 buck fix."
981227,bow slayer,2016-09-09 13:55:00,1074,"where could I find JB weld,CT? Princess Auto? TSC?"
981229,jimmer,2016-09-09 14:53:00,2730,Canadian Tire carries JB Weld as do most hardware stores.
