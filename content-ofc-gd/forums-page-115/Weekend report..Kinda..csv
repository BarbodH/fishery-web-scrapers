This time I invited a god friend and one of his sons up for a weekend of fun and fishing with my daughter and myself .Their names are Drew and Brayden. We left Fri PM hit up the H&H tackle here in Brantford and got 3 dozen minnows. Got there about midnight, had a couple cold ones kids had pops and off to bed we went..We got the boat in the water the next morning. Fishing was slow. So slow we had minnows to give away at the end of the weekend. We did manage to boat a few fish for our efforts.  The youngster turned out to be the lucky one in the boat. His first fish is a good sized smallyLook at the smile, how could I not share..One proud Dad here I think..A few minutes go by and Boom the kid is on again. This time its for real. I thought he was into a big walleye. As it turns out it was just a small 21 inch pike. He was able to (barely) hang on and actually land it. He had ZERO interest in touching it so I held it for him in this pic..We did manage to land a few more fish but these were the photo worthy  moments I just had to share.. Way to go Brayden, were all proud of ya my little man!!!"
