Cant wait to see Austin Willie and Mitch this fall..If Mitch doesnt make the cut (witch I highly doubt) he has to go back to the OHL. I just cant see him getting any better there.Futures bright!!!!"

980261,AKRISONER,2016-08-23 13:50:00,5558,he wont make the team...and if he does he will be a utility for the marlies on a 2 way...basically just adds some depth to the 4th line if one of your bigger guys gets hurt you can use him in a limited roll.  Prust has had some serious leg injuries that have hindered his skating abilitiy. The bonus here is that he is an experienced NHLer that can provide that to the marlies.

I may not have been a big fan of Kessel when he played for the Leafs but I will say the man is a heck of a guy!!!!  http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/phil-kessel-stanley-cup-1.3684253   By Matthew Cullen, CBC Sports Posted: Jul 18, 2016 4:43 PM ET Last Updated: Jul 18, 2016 4:43 PM ET Pittsburgh Penguins forward Phil Kessel celebrates after winning the Stanley Cup in June. On Monday, Kessel returned to Toronto with Lord Stanley's mug and made a stop at the Hospital for Sick Children. (Christian Petersen/Getty Images) How times can change. On Monday, the oft-criticized former Maple Leafs' star made good on his promise to bring the Cup to the city he called home for five years. However, instead of a flashy news conference or a public event, Kessel made a quiet visit to a place he knew would appreciate it – Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. The 28-year-old spent the day Monday at SickKids sharing the Cup with children and their families.      SickKids was buzzing with #StanleyCup fever today! Thx for visiting our patients & families @PKessel81 #NHL When Kessel first announced in late June that he would be returning north of the border with the Cup, many thought the former Leaf was just taunting the Toronto fan base that hasn't celebrated its own championship since 1967.  @PKessel81 taking the cup back to Toronto is pretty much a big middle finger to the entire city phil kessel bringing the stanley cup to toronto is peak pettiness i love it. However, the Madison, Wis., native now seems to have quashed any bad feelings about the move with the Toronto faithful. Phil Kessel brought the cup to Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto... Class act I've not been a @PKessel81 fan these last few yrs, but I tip my hat to him bringing #StanleyCup to @sickkids. Classy.  Phil Kessel takes the Cup back to Toronto and lets kids who are sick in the hospital have a great day with it. What a human. Kessel even had some extra company coming down for the big visit – former Maple Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf and actress wife Elisha Cuthbert.  "

Swedish outlet Expressen's Johan Svensson reports the team is nearing a deal withJhonas Enroth. The 28-year-old Swede spent last season with the Los Angeles Kings, backing up Jonathan Quick. He appeared in 16 games, going 7-5-1 with a goals against average of 2.17 and a .922 save percentage. Enroth was originally taken with the 46th-overall pick in the 2006 National Hockey League Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres. After nearly five seasons with the Sabres, Enroth was shipped to the Dallas Stars at the 2015 trade deadline. In 147 career NHL games, the Stockholm native is 50-66-15 with a 2.80 GAA, .911 save percentage and seven shutouts. Enroth has represented Sweden internationally on a number of occasions, including as part of the gold medal-winning team at the 2013 IIHF World Championship and the team that captured silver at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. The Leafs also have goaltenders Garret Sparks and Antoine Bibeau under contract.  "

Or will he be a back up to the new young gun? Is that streven, think thats his name, going to be the back up and Bernie gone? The leafs havent had a solid  goalie since Cujo,Fuhr, Wregget and Palmateer, Potvin. My god Im dating myself."
974359,leaf4,2016-06-21 01:00:00,2466,"Bernie is as good as gone this season after this move. I hope the leafs can continue to improve their corsi because that's what Andersen's been used to playing behind is Anaheim who was a large possession team, so the leafs have to keep trending up and start where they left off last season"

This guy is signed for 5 years...meaning he is in for the long haul. I dont expect him to be great this season while this team continutes to mold. But 3 years from now when the likes of marner, nylander and now matthews have learned to play at the NHL level, you are looking at a team that can play both ends of the rink and provide some protection.  Most important part here is that the leafs just signed a starting goalie, and no one really has anything negative to say about it..No one is calling him the second coming of jesus either so there is no pressure at all on him. since when does that happen in toronto?"

975001,leaf4,2016-06-27 20:53:00,2466,"If they could get him at 9 mill a year that's the limit on what he's worth in my opinion, with 2-3 years on a lot of these young guys entry level contracts you can afford it, plus with lupul, robidas, greening, laich, michalek all on deals that still run a year or 2 and are all very unlikely to stick on this team after their deals are up I'm sure they could ditch the contracts somewhere, but you also have to realize stammer isn't getting any younger, and for what it's worth I'm happy with Babcock being a mentor to the guys they are going to need to lean on in the future"
975006,grimsbylander,2016-06-27 21:30:00,3016,Edmonton is the poster child for a what happens when you stack a team with 19 year old stars...absolutely nothing. It doesn't have to be Stamkos but there has to be someone with leadership and mentoring qualities. Remember when the Pens signed Gary Roberts way back?

At the same time I'm pulling for Joe and Marleau, those two totally deserve it too, a combined 3000+ games between the two of them and they haven't made it to the finals it would be awesome for them to close it out"
971620,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-28 22:54:00,10439,"http://www.tsn.ca/leafs-marner-named-chl-player-of-the-year-1.497378   Mitch Marner, Claus Andersen/Getty Images RED DEER, Alta. — Mitch Marner's dad built him a display case for his accomplishments while he was still playing minor hockey. His latest trophy might need its own stand. The London Knights forward was named Canadian Hockey League player of the year on Saturday — a trophy so big in size that two people had to carry it for Marner when it was time for him to take pictures with it. ""My dad got (a trophy case) made when I won my first one, it was special at that time with little trophies,"" said Marner. ""It's special to be named to this, (but) I don't know if this one will fit in the trophy case."" The 19-year-old Marner, who the Toronto Maple Leafs selected fourth overall in the 2015 NHL Draft, tore up the Ontario Hockey League this season, and has been picking up awards with ease. He was named the OHL's most outstanding player in the regular season after producing 39 goals and 116 points in 57 games. He followed that up by winning the OHL playoff MVP with 44 points in 18 games, leading his Knights to a spot in the 2016 Memorial Cup. Marner, from Thornhill, Ont., has played the entire season on a line with Matthew Tkachuk and Christian Dvorak. All three broke the 100-point mark for London, finished 1-2-3 in playoff scoring and have been unstoppable at the Memorial Cup. He believes the award wouldn't be his without their help. ""Those two could be on the trophy just as much as I can,"" said Marner, who has 13 points in three games at the Memorial Cup — just three off the tournament record. Connor McDavid earned the award last season. ""There's a lot of big names on (the trophy), but like I said all year it wouldn't be possible without the players and the coaching staff. Without those guys on my (line) who knows what would have happened?"" Dvorak says playing with Marner has made hockey an easier game to play. ""He can do anything out there, makes a lot of plays, knows where we are on the ice without even looking,"" said Dvorak. ""Awesome player, not only finding people but being able to bury it too. You can rely on him in all situations,"" added Tkachuk. Marner beat out Dryden Hunt of the Moose Jaw Warriors and Francis Perron of the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies for the honour. When he called his parents to tell them the news, they didn't know what to say. ""They were speechless,"" said Marner. ""They are the reason why I am here today. It's crazy what they've done for me. I wouldn't be anywhere without them."" The CHL gave out nine other awards on Saturday. Mississauga's Alex Nylander won rookie of the year, Everett's Carter Hart earned goaltender of the year and Brandon's Ivan Provorov took home defenceman of the year. Moncton's Conor Garland won the top scorer with 128 points in 62 games, Cape Breton's Pierre-Luc Dubois earned top NHL draft prospect, sportsman of the year went to Shawinigan's Samuel Girard, Saginaw's Will Petschenig won humanitarian of the year, the scholastic player award was given to Alexis D'Aoust of Shawinigan and Rouyn-Noranda's Gilles Bouchard was named coach of the year. Marner and his Knights will face Perron and the Huskies in the Memorial Cup final on Sunday. His advice to upcoming players trying to do what he's done this past season is simple: ""Sacrifice, work as hard as you can every day and just buy into the system that every day you are prepared.""

George skinny jeans Strombopoadoppleous is gonzo!!!!!  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/rogers-to-replace-stromboulopoulos-with-ron-maclean-on-hockey-night-in-canada/article30519154/   DAVID SHOALTS The Globe and Mail Published Last updated Rogers Media is planning to replace George Stroumboulopoulos with Ron MacLean as host of Hockey Night In Canada next season but many details need to be worked out before the deal can be declared official, according to multiple sources. The chief stumbling block to the move is that Mr. MacLean, 56, is adamant that he will not give up his position as sidekick to Don Cherry on the Coach’s Corner segment on Hockey Night, nor will he step down as host of Rogers’ Sunday night show, Hometown Hockey. A source says the Rogers plan has the backing of National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman, despite his past fractious relationship with Mr. MacLean. The move also comes as Rogers has struggled in the first two years of a 12-year, $5.2-billion deal for the Canadian na-tional broadcast rights to NHL hockey. The negotiations with Mr. MacLean are continuing. Until Mr. MacLean and his bosses, Rogers Media president Rick Brace, Sportsnet president Scott Moore and production chief Rob Corte, can work out how Mr. MacLean will do all three jobs, the ouster of Mr. Stroumboulopoulos, 43, cannot proceed, sources said. If Mr. MacLean regains the job he held from 1986 to 2014, when he was demoted from host of Hockey Night to the Sunday-night show and his spot with Mr. Cherry, it will be a stunning comeback. Mr. MacLean lost the post in no small part due to his battles with Mr. Bettman. The two clashed on the air many times during interviews as Mr. MacLean took a strong pro-player stand during the NHL’s many labour squabbles. After Rogers cut the deal with the NHL, Mr. Moore said many times that he regarded the NHL as a partner. Mr. MacLean himself acknowledged his relationship with Mr. Bettman could have cost him the host’s job. Mr. Bettman could not be reached for comment and Mr. MacLean declined to comment in detail. “I can’t say a thing until Rob Corte or Scott Moore say a thing [about the plans for the 2016-17 season],” he said Sunday night. But Mr. MacLean did add that when it comes to Hometown Hockey, “I’m not going anywhere, I’m really into that and committed to it and Coach’s Corner.” Mr. Stroumboulopoulos did not respond to a request for comment. One of Mr. Stroumboulopoulos’s friends said the broadcaster was in the midst of riding his motorcycle from Toronto to Los Angeles. Several sources said Rogers’ hockey employees are expecting to hear the company’s plans for next season as soon as the NHL draft wraps up on Saturday. Over the past two years, Rogers has been hurt by the struggles of the seven Canadian teams, resulting in ratings declines and firings in the hockey department. Company staffers have said they expect sweeping changes to the hockey broadcasts over the summer. Mr. Moore said in an e-mail that the story “is speculation. We won’t comment on rumours.” Mr. Brace and Mr. Corte could not be reached for comment. One source said Mr. Moore was responsible for the decision and he has been considering the move for at least a year. Discussions are under way with Mr. Stroumboulopoulos’s representatives about a contract settlement (it is believed he has two years remaining on his deal), the source also said. Mr. MacLean took the loss of the Hockey Night host job in stride and remained loyal to Rogers. While the ratings on Hometown Hockey were disappointing, often because too few good games were shown that night, Mr. MacLean was said to have done an outstanding job as host. He broadcast each week from a small town in Canada and the show was seen by those at the top of Rogers Communications Inc., including chief executive officer Guy Laurence, as important from a community-building perspective. They loved Mr. MacLean’s work and his stock with Rogers’ top executives rose dramatically. Mr. Stroumboulopoulos was hired to give the staid Hockey Night show a more youthful face. But his his style never captured the imagination of the television audience. Criticism of Mr. Stroumboulopoulos’s skinny suits was frequent on social media and viewers also felt his passions – he still has a CBC radio show that focuses on music – did not lie with hockey. Rogers hockey staffers contacted Sunday said they were not surprised about the pending move, which was signalled this summer in the surprise firing of Gord Cutler, the head of hockey production at Rogers. Mr. Cutler was hired away from rival Bell Media’s TSN and he, along with Mr. Moore, were behind the radical change in broadcast style from the CBC version of Hockey Night. Rogers sources said Mr. Cutler made it clear he was not as enamoured of Mr. MacLean and Mr. Cherry as the previous regime and their time on air was cut under the new boss. But after Mr. Cutler was fired, Mr. MacLean and Mr. Cherry were seen more often on the air during the playoffs. So was another old CBC hand, legendary play-by-play announcer Bob Cole. Rogers insiders say viewers can expect to see a return to a more traditional look for the hockey broadcasts this fall.   http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/report-ron-maclean-to-return-as-hockey-night-host-replace-george-stroumboulopoulos/   Hockey Night in Canada might have a different look next season, but it’s going to feel awfully familiar for Canadian hockey fans. According to the Toronto Star’s Dave Feschuk, Rogers is set to replace Hockey Night host George Stroumboulopoulos with Ron MacLean, who Stroumboulopoulos had replaced in the host’s chair when the iconic program became part of the Rogers broadcast family. Stroumboulopoulos took over as host on the tail of his successful CBC interview show, and the hope was ‘Strombo’ would draw in and appeal to a younger audience. The change hasn’t been made official by Rogers, and Scott Moore, president of Sportsnet, told Feschuk that at this point the reports of the switch back to MacLean are “simply speculation,” adding that no plans have been finalized for the 2016-17 season. However, if the swap is made and Stroumboulopoulos is out as the host, it will mean he lasted only two seasons as the face of the program. There are no details regarding the possibility of Stroumboulopoulos continuing with the Hockey Night broadcast in any other capacity. As for MacLean, his return would see him inch closer to 30 years as the host of the program. MacLean’s original run as the host began in 1986 and continued until 2014, at which point he was replaced by Stroumboulopoulos. MacLean has remained with Hockey Night, though, working the first intermission with Don Cherry on Coach’s Corner and MacLean was host of the Sunday evening Hometown Hockey broadcasts. Cherry recently signed a multi-year deal to remain a part of Hockey Night, and MacLean, his longtime sidekick, will remain in the role. MacLean told Feschuk that he is committed to fulfilling his duties on Coach’s Corner and Hometown Hockey, but wouldn’t comment on the report that he was set to take over hosting duties once again.

They also gave up a 2nd rounder next year. The leafs still have 11 picks in this years draft including #1 and #31.  http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=886552     The Toronto Maple Leafs announced today that the hockey club has acquired goaltender Frederik Andersen from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for the 30th overall selection from the 2016 NHL Entry Draft (originally acquired by Toronto from Pittsburgh) and a second round selection from the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. Andersen posted a 22-9-7 record with a 2.30 goals-against-average (GAA) and .919 save-percentage (SV%) in 43 games (37 starts) last season with the Ducks. The 26-year-old also went 3-2 with a 1.41 GAA and .947 SV% in five playoff starts in the 2016 post-season. In 125 career regular season games with Anaheim, Andersen has posted a 77-26-12 record with a 2.33 GAA and .918 SV%. He also holds a 17-9-2 career post-season record with a 2.34 GAA and .916 SV%. In 2014-15 season, Andersen became the fastest goaltender to reach the 26-win mark (26-5-0) in NHL history and tied the league record for the fastest to 50 career wins (50-13-5), originally set by Montreal’s Bill Durnan (50-9-9) in 1944. During the 2013-14 season, Andersen was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team after posting a 20-5-0 record with a 2.29 GAA and .923 SV% in 28 appearances. That season he led all rookie goaltenders in wins, goals-against average and save percentage -- the best numbers in those categories by any rookie netminder since 2010-11. The Herning, Denmark native was selected by Anaheim in the third round (87th overall) of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. "
974333,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-20 22:00:00,10439,"http://www.tsn.ca/statistically-speaking-leafs-land-a-new-goalie-1.511676   Frederik Andersen, The Canadian Press TSN.ca Analytics Follow|Archive The Toronto Maple Leafs are going to be a lot better next season and they started their quest by dealing for a new starting goaltender. Statistically Speaking breaks down Toronto’s trade for Frederik Andersen. Anaheim was dealing from a position of strength, and Toronto addressed a need. The Maple Leafs Get: G Frederik Andersen Andersen, 26, has been an above-average puck-stopper for the Ducks, posting a .918 save percentage (.925 at even strength) in 125 career games. He also has a .916 save percentage in 28 playoff games. He doesn't appear to be a star but, more and more, we've seen that a star in net isn't what is needed to have success. The difficulty for Andersen was that he had been battling John Gibson for playing time in Anaheim, and it’s a battle that was tilting in Gibson’s favour, not least of all because Gibson is a highly-touted, 22-year-old so, at least theoretically, he offers more seasons of prime performance. Andersen is a 6-foot-4, 220-pounder who hails from Denmark that has the size teams tend to seek out in goaltenders and that stands in contrast to the goaltender that the Maple Leafs currently have under contract, Jonathan Bernier, who is listed at 6-foot and 184 pounds. While Bernier has struggled in the past couple of seasons with the Maple Leafs – his .915 career save percentage isn’t far off of Andersen’s track record – and it’s likely going to be what the Leafs try to sell on the trade market. There aren’t a lot of teams with needs for a starting goaltender, or at least a goaltender with a $4.15-million cap hit, but it won’t be a surprise if Bernier is playing somewhere other than Toronto next season; either that, or he will be an expensive backup. Andersen, who made $1.3-million last season, was set to be a restricted free agent, but has signed a new five-year contract with the Maple Leafs. He’s the present and the future in goal for the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Ducks Get: A first-round pick in 2016 and a second-round pick in 2017 The first pick that the Ducks receive will be the 30th pick in this year’s draft (which originally belonged to the Pittsburgh Penguins). The 30th pick typically offers a little less than a 40% chance of turning into an NHL player. The Ducks now have a couple of late first rounders to play with in Friday's first-round. There’s some variance with the 2017 second-round pick that the Ducks will receive, since it depends on the 2016-2017 standings, but a second-round pick, generally, presents just barely better than a one-in-three chance of becoming an NHL player. Between the two picks, there is a fair opportunity for the Ducks to find a player that will have some value to them long-term, and this is a case of Anaheim dealing from a position of strength. Gibson is a very good young goaltender so it made no sense for the Ducks to pay a big price to keep Andersen too. Verdict: While the price of the picks might appear significant, there’s a lot of uncertainty there, more than would reasonably be expected when evaluating a goaltender with Andersen’s track record. Thus, the Maple Leafs get the nod for acquiring the better player at a fair, but not unreasonable, price.  "

Edmonton has bad D because they refused to draft or trade for D. I know goalies are a little bit more difficult to draft (see DiPietro) but Edmonton has done nothing to address the problems their teams have. They just keep hoping their young stars will one day 'Get it' and they will outscore other teams 10-8.  I like Edmonton, I do. I used to live there and got to catch a few games live. Its all the more reason that I'm angry with the nonchalant attitude they are taking to rebuilding the franchise."

968254,muddler,2016-05-01 19:45:00,623,"Lucas , please read my previous post carefully. I think you put much more into it than what was said.  The Oilers will get to the cup before the Leafs. Count on it.  When you are at the bottom it's a looooooong way back up, especially when every other team is trying to the same thing. As typical Leafs fans, I have heard this from so many other over 40 years. I will take a lot more than one #1 pick to change that. That's what I was saying in my previous post.  To even suggest otherwise is (in your words) , ""delusional"".  muddler"
968256,glen,2016-05-01 20:00:00,2641,I'd put money on the leafs. Before oilers.  I saw that interview with Austin and he didn't look happy.

It may not be in our lifetime but the oilers have made some poor poor decisions and the worst part is they refuse to own up to them. They could have built a decent team by trading some of their big name players but refuse to for some reason.  As long as the Oilers have Hall, Nugent-H, Eberle and No-goal-Apov, they aren't going anywhere.  (And I mean all 4 of them. I think they should keep 2 and move the other two for their areas of need.)"

964935,leaf4,2016-04-02 19:26:00,2466,Kessel with another.....
964954,G.mech,2016-04-02 21:26:00,830,Kessel with another..... Wow that makes 26 for the year!!!  He's the man.  http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/penguins-phil-kessel-the-most-overrated-player-according-to-player-poll/
964959,John Bacon,2016-04-02 22:03:00,3277,Too good not to share!!!  http://www2.tsn.ca/bardown/Story.aspx?Players+vote+Phil+Kessel+most+overrated+player+in+the+NHL&id=576338   It looks like only 27 players voted.  The article below mentioned that he received 30% of the votes; then later mentions that he received 8 votes.  And when Phaneuf was voted the most overrated... it was because he received all of the three votes.  Obviously there is not much participation from the players in these votes.  http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/penguins-phil-kessel-the-most-overrated-player-according-to-player-poll/  
965064,leaf4,2016-04-03 19:14:00,2466,Stamkos out with a blood clot.... Blood clot at 26...? Weird.
965094,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-03 22:43:00,10439,The Habs have called John Scott up from the minors.
965394,dave524,2016-04-06 12:35:00,4508,Wife just commented that Reimer had 29 saves for his 3rd shutout in 9 games.
965406,grimsbylander,2016-04-06 13:28:00,3016,Edmonton is really starting to piss me off.
965407,leaf4,2016-04-06 13:30:00,2466,"Yuuuuuuup! How can you be that bad.... Seriously I'm praying the leafs lose the rest of the season and Edmonton wins just one, that's all we need to secure first but how on earth are they even in the position they're in..."
965408,grimsbylander,2016-04-06 13:35:00,3016,There's trying to tank after you trade away a couple of your top players and then ice a Jr team VS trying to tank after getting 3 number one picks....I call bull$#!). LOL
965412,jimmer,2016-04-06 13:59:00,2730,"Edmonton and Toronto have the same number of points, but Edmonton has more wins, doesn't that give the first overall to Toronto if they both lose out the season?"
965418,Acountdeleted,2016-04-06 14:39:00,2562,How can you be so bad for so long if you're Edmonton? Seriously? Not making the playoffs since 2006 is one thing but how many times have they finished bottom 5 in the past 10 years? All of them?
965420,grimsbylander,2016-04-06 14:41:00,3016,Edmonton should get 10 points for diving! Lmao
965424,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-06 14:58:00,10439,Wife just commented that Reimer had 29 saves for his 3rd shutout in 9 games.  That's what happens when there is a good defense in front of your goalie.
965425,G.mech,2016-04-06 14:59:00,830,"Edmonton and Toronto have the same number of points, but Edmonton has more wins, doesn't that give the first overall to Toronto if they both lose out the season?  All the teams still go in the draft lottery, nobody secures first pick based on standings you only better your odds a bit by taking a dive."
965426,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-06 14:59:00,10439,"Edmonton and Toronto have the same number of points, but Edmonton has more wins, doesn't that give the first overall to Toronto if they both lose out the season?  Edmonton has played one more game than TO @ this point. That's why they are 30th."
965440,grimsbylander,2016-04-06 16:10:00,3016, Edmonton has played one more game than TO @ this point. That's why they are 30th. That's the whole point! One game!?
965449,jimmer,2016-04-06 16:32:00,2730,"Yes, I understand the lottery, just hoping the Leafs get the best odds. We all know how that went for Buffalo last year though. Now it's a lottery for the top three picks."
965458,Acountdeleted,2016-04-06 17:19:00,2562,"If Edmonton comes in 29th or 28th and they still win the lottery are they just going to toss the rest of the envelopes up in frustration?  In all honesty, if Edmonton wins  I can see an 'Oilers clause' being put in place where you can't win the #1 pick two years in a row."
965459,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-06 17:25:00,10439,"If Edmonton comes in 29th or 28th and they still win the lottery are they just going to toss the rest of the envelopes up in frustration?  In all honesty, if Edmonton wins  I can see an 'Oilers clause' being put in place where you can't win the #1 pick two years in a row.  Actually I think that once you win the #1 pick the team should be pulled from the #1 drawing for 5 years. Heck if they were just pulled for one year they still have the chance of winning 3 out of 5 years which is really not much off what Edmonton has done with 4 wins in the last 6 years."
965460,G.mech,2016-04-06 17:33:00,830,Maybe it should be a fan vote for the top 3 picks....it worked for the All Start game didn't it???
965462,Acountdeleted,2016-04-06 17:38:00,2562,I vote the team with the first pick must select John Scott!
965463,BillM,2016-04-06 17:43:00,17367,"Edmonton should be removed from the league if they get the #1 pick again, lol."
965465,leaf4,2016-04-06 18:10:00,2466,"I agree with not picking 1st two years in a row, but what happens to their potential pick at that spot? Say they leave the odds as it is and if its them that comes up first should they toss it so the odds aren't changed or what algorithm do they then use as odds are a tricky thing to get right to please all parties"
964372,leaf4,2016-03-29 21:04:00,2466,I don't understand how he is over rated though? He's been a consistent performer and does what he's been typecast into really.

964385,leaf4,2016-03-29 22:09:00,2466,"I could see subban as overrated (as he was voted by the fans) makes way too much for the production he's had, never showed near enough for 9 mill a year, not even stamkos, he's on a decline"
964491,lookinforwalleye,2016-03-30 18:26:00,4399,well if the fans think so it must be true...
964494,davey buoy,2016-03-30 19:03:00,5505,"Heard today,there is a long list of players that would love to work for Babs. Stammer was mentioned again.Any one hear that,?.Just caught that last part on the radio."
964501,jimmer,2016-03-30 20:02:00,2730,The Leafs need to send some of those high flying rookies down and bring back the old legs for the rest of the year. Casts and all if that's what it takes.
964502,manitoubass2,2016-03-30 20:03:00,11391,For the love of god please dont sign stamkos
964518,leaf4,2016-03-30 21:40:00,2466,"+1 to that, guys past his prime"
964547,Oggie,2016-03-31 00:25:00,588,Stamkos wouldn't be a good fit. He's past his prime and we've been down this road before.  Stick with the youth movement!
964551,DRIFTER_016,2016-03-31 01:26:00,10439,Anyone watching the Sens/Jets game? Byfuglien dang near killed Stone with the best body check this season!!  
964564,leaf4,2016-03-31 02:26:00,2466,Like skating into a freight train that is
964570,manitoubass2,2016-03-31 02:43:00,11391,Holy crap!  That rattled the brain
964620,grimsbylander,2016-03-31 14:00:00,3016,OH boy did he get crushed. He saw tweety birds after that hit. Ouch
964683,misfish,2016-03-31 21:29:00,29133,Give the big man credit after as well. He just held on to the little guy that wanted to fight him. LOL  260 POUNDS. WOW.
964684,manitoubass2,2016-03-31 21:33:00,11391,Especially since hes a bass angler lol

964713,leaf4,2016-04-01 01:46:00,2466,Look at his stats and tell me I'm wrong PLEASE  He's not been the same since his injury.
964714,manitoubass2,2016-04-01 01:52:00,11391,Yep!  The way he came back im guessing he was getting alot of cortisone shots. If thats the case he'll be retiring early as it wreaks havok on tendons and ligaments
964738,lookinforwalleye,2016-04-01 12:01:00,4399,I don't know what stats you hockey experts are looking at but outside of his injury year he is top 5 in goals usually top 3...have you guys noticed a general trend in goal scoring is way down...not a Stamkos thing it's a league thing...might have something to do with what the NHL lets the goalies wear....
964739,leaf4,2016-04-01 12:31:00,2466,"Regardless of your opinion on goal scoring and points, it only further shows the guys not worth whatever people think he'll get on the open market, I think he was offered 8.5 already, shoulda taken it and ran"
964741,lookinforwalleye,2016-04-01 12:42:00,4399,Well neither is anybody else using your metric...
964752,leaf4,2016-04-01 13:22:00,2466,"  Map the regression, he's not quite a point a game player as it is, and the only reason he is close is because of his seasons over 3 years ago...  You are a Habs fan after all so I don't suppose common sense is in large supply!  Also take into account he's currently sitting in 17th in points across the league being outscored by guys like Johnny gaudreau, Erik karlsson and evgeny kusnetsov, to name a few of the guys who probably should be in his rearview mirror in points"
964760,jimmer,2016-04-01 14:19:00,2730,"That's the way I like to see the Leafs play out the season. At first I thought adding Stamkos would be a great move by the Leafs. I still think he would be a great addition, but not at the money that is being thrown around. It will tie their hands when those young guys play out their rookie contracts."
964829,G.mech,2016-04-01 19:38:00,830,"Map the regression, he's not quite a point a game player as it is, and the only reason he is close is because of his seasons over 3 years ago...

The plus side for Phil is, he will never get injured they way he plays unless he fans a big one timer and fall on his a$$ again."
964832,leaf4,2016-04-01 19:47:00,2466,"Maybe a 10million dollar salary, not cap hit, which is what matters.  He's making too much for what he's been producing, for what its worth I think had mike Sullivan been coaching all year he would be well ahead of his point totals that he currently is due to the bad system mike Johnston was implementing, did not play to the strengths of his team and led too conservative of a game.  Now kessel playing under Wilson or Carlyle was a points beast, but also a huge defensive liability in part to the systems each coach used, he is being made more accountable with Sullivan and weball know how streaky kessel can be, what's he at in the past five games? 9 points,  Again kessel is not a center man nor is he stamkos they are completely different"
960583,John Bacon,2016-03-01 23:04:00,3277,"I do not agree that this is different ,in that they have always given away there draft choices.  You're right that they have always give away there draft choices.  But now they are acquiring draft choices instead of giving them away.  This is the first time in at least 40 years that the Leafs have tried to rebuild by acquiring draft choices.  Trading away their draft choices for the past forty or so years has not produced good results.  Maybe acquiring draft choices will.  It won't be this year; but they may eventually have a good team with the draft choices that they acquire.  If they continued on the old way then they might make the playoffs once in a while; but they would never go deep into the playoffs.  I am willing to wait a few years knowing that there is at least a chance (no guarantee) that they may actually have a really good team when their talent develops."
960651,glen,2016-03-02 10:27:00,2641,Yes hopfully drafting will work.  But the new style of play in the NHL hurts my eyes.  The good days are over.
961098,DRIFTER_016,2016-03-06 02:47:00,10439,WHEW!!!! That was close!!!! The Marlies almost beat the Sens!!!!  
961116,G.mech,2016-03-06 14:59:00,830,"I actually felt a bit sorry for Phaneuf last night.  Right off the opening draw he coughs up the puck and gives up a semi-breakaway 2 seconds into the game...I think maybe his nerves got the better of him.  I'm not sure who won the fight but the tribute was kind of nice, notice they never did one for Kessel though."
961570,huzzsaba,2016-03-09 11:42:00,884,I am so happy for Reimer.  gets a shutout last night and the happiness on his face : Priceless!  Will be nice to see him get a second chance at the playoffs this year.
961576,Acountdeleted,2016-03-09 12:52:00,2562,"I hear Reimer shutout and all I can think is the Leafs didn't get fair value in that trade. Its a shame, Reim's is going to be a pretty good backup in SJ. Especially with the goal scoring to help him out when he coughs up 1 or 2 bad ones."
961586,manitoubass2,2016-03-09 13:42:00,11391,Im happy for reimer as well!  But hes never gonna be a #1 goaltender unless some fantastic coach can turn him around.  He reminds me of triple a goaltenders thinking their dominique hasek.
961593,leaf4,2016-03-09 14:43:00,2466,"I don't mind seeing reimer walk, he's good but needs to stay consistent for a full season before he can be considered a no. 1  Anyone see that polak and nurse scuffle? I would love to see round 2 when polak isn't jumped unsuspecting for hendricks losing an edge, hopefully nurse gets a game or 2, polak didn't even drop the gloves sheesh"

Looks like the laffs will lock up last place so at least you got something out of the season. Hopefully Edmonton doesn't win the lottery this year. Sad state of affair for Canadian hockey when even the laffites won't jump into a little banter. "
962340,grimsbylander,2016-03-13 21:17:00,3016,"Yup. Sad day when a Leaf fan is too disinterested to mock the Sens. Oh well, we're right where we should be to give us the 20% shot at first pick. It's going to take a long time to turn this ship around so no use getting hyped up about anything. If Edmonton gets first pick, I'm done forever! Lol"

960401,DRIFTER_016,2016-02-29 22:46:00,10439,"http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=871447   The Maple Leafs finished up their extensive roster work late Sunday and early Monday with a number of moves – some of which involved deals prior to the NHL trade deadline, while others came in the form of player movement between the Leafs and AHL Marlies. And although some familiar names moved out of Toronto, the franchise’s youth push is moving full-steam ahead, and that presents an exciting challenge for Buds head coach Mike Babcock & Co. “Eight years of junior I coached, but I never had a team this young in the American League,” Babcock said prior to Toronto’s game against Tampa Bay Monday at Air Canada Centre. “Obviously, it’s exciting, you watch them they’re exciting. But they’re also kids.” The Leafs made a deal late Sunday night with Washington that sent forward Daniel Winnik and Anaheim’s fifth-round draft pick in 2016 to the Capitals in exchange for forward Brooks Laich, minor-league prospect defenceman Connor Carrick and a second-round pick this summer. And while they didn’t make any further moves before the 3 p.m. trade deadline, their recent run of manoeuvres saw Toronto GM Lou Lamoriello also ship out goalie James Reimer, blueliners Dion Phaneuf and Roman Polak, and forwards Shawn Matthias and Nick Spaling in various transactions, and bring in four second-round draft picks, two fourth-rounders, veterans Milan Michalek and a number of experienced pros for the Marlies roster. In addition, the Leafs recalled five forwards from the Marlies Monday – William Nylander, Kasperi Kapanen, Zach Hyman,Nikita Soshnikov and Ben Smith – and loaned forwards Mark Arcobello, Josh Leivo and Brendan Leipsic to the Marlies. All in all, the roster reshaping made clear what the plan is for Toronto in the months and years ahead: patience, development and a reliance on a deep pool of young talent that’s only getting deeper. “This was our plan all along,” Lamoriello said in a post-trade-deadline press conference. “Once we got to the trade deadline, we felt it was the opportune time with 20 games left (in the NHL regular season) to try and get as many of these young guys that we can in here to get the experience, and yet keep them all eligible to go back for the (AHL) playoffs. It’s what’s best for their development.” The Leafs will take on the Bolts with seven new faces (including Laich and Carrick) in the lineup, and Buds fans likely will be most interested to see the NHL debuts of youngsters Nylander, Kapanen, Soshnikov and Hyman, none of whom are older than 23. All four forwards have enjoyed stellar seasons with the Marlies, and with Leafs veterans Tyler Bozak, James van Riemsdyk and Joffrey Lupul on the sidelines nursing injuries, the quartet will have every chance to make a positive impression on Babcock and team brass. “I want to know who’s a real player,” Babcock said of the opportunity awaiting the newest Leafs. “Just because you did it in the American League doesn’t mean you’re going to do it here. I want to know who’s got upside, and who’s got hockey sense, and who’s got determination, who lives right, who’s going to be a Maple Leaf for a long period of time, and who’s not.” Despite speculation, the Leafs did not find an appropriate trade for winger P-A Parenteau, who has repeatedly expressed his happiness playing in Toronto. He and fellow veterans Leo Komarov – whom Lamoriello said was “a core member” of the team he didn’t consider moving – and Matt Hunwick will be relied on the rest of the season to show the Buds’ fresh faces what it means to be a professional at the NHL level. And the organization will continue to work with their youth to create a competitive core it hopes eventually will rival any in the league. “To say that we would not have given P-A an opportunity to go to a team if it was the right decision, we were, we were prepared to do that,” Lamoriello said of Parenteau. “(A trade) did not work out, he’s here, he’s had an excellent year, and he’ll help the young guys along throughout the process.” Lamoriello – who also noted defenceman Jared Cowen would not play again this season and have the final year of his contract bought out this summer – believes the sum total of the deals that were made in the weeks and hours before the deadline gives the Leafs sufficient salary cap flexibility with which to navigate the NHL waters, continue to identify and acquire key components down the line, and strengthen the organization in the process. “I think what we did was accomplish by cleaning the cap problem not only today…but for the future,” Lamoriello said. “And I think it does give us the flexibility to do what’s necessary. We certainly have players to sign, we have the ability to acquire players, we have the ability to sign players, we have that room that’s necessary to do what we need to do.” Babcock concurred. “We’ve done a real nice job of acquiring prospects and picks,” Babcock said. “This was our plan, and we want to set ourselves up for a long run, so we’re not talking about trading guys at the deadline, we’re talking about who we acquired at the deadline. That’s our goal.”  "

No, it is not the ""same old song"".  This is the first time in over forty years that they have tried to rebuild with draft picks.  The  ""same old song"" would be trading away their draft picks for questionable talent.  This is what should have been done in 2006.  I think the management is good, but it is going to take a while to undo years of bad management by their predecessors.  Being the richest team doesn't mean much when there is a salary cap.  The days of being able to buy a good team ended in 2004.  It took the Leafs 10 years to adapt to the new reality."

Where else can you go and discuss a whole lot of overpaid players and still feel like this.Mr Bacon and whoever the same,as I have said this will kill the Leafs and further.These players are way overpriced and doing something we used to play for free sometimes lol."

I said crap 3 times sorry guys,Could of called it worse,but this is my opinion as many I know. Hope they suffer for a few years.What a waste of management $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
958069,davey buoy,2016-02-16 20:37:00,5505,"My take as always,not so much getting rid of Dion,maybe. They say 3-4 years,not sure why they want to put us through that for another 3-4 years.Draft choices,draft choices/trade. This is a long haul. You have some cap room ,treat us Leafs fans for a bit of optimism . We need a captain/center,whatever,maybe this will happen in the next two weeks?getting rid of Dion,give us a veteran or someone to build around.As a life long Leaf fan I am not so sure I can wait another 3-4 years for again /maybe a good Leaf team. Just me wondering what these all high priced management are going to do and justify for the next 3-4 years..START NOW,by the dead line ."
958149,Oggie,2016-02-17 14:00:00,588,Wow! I had no idea about this! I had no idea either!  Burke .... unless they were NCAA grads he'd never draft them!  Iguess that's why I share Dave's sentiments.  The leafs do work harder and they do play with a system so you can see they're being coached. The problem now is they have so little talent and they're so young.  I'm just weary of the unpteenth rebuild!  Let's dump the salary cap and just buy a team the way the Yankees do!
958166,leaf4,2016-02-17 17:22:00,2466,"Wouldn't that be nice, but the mlb just makes the team pay them directly with a luxury tax, with the NHL it affects next seasons cap by reducing it"

Toronto has the Blue Jays and Raptors so people aren't even following the rebuilding Leafs.  It's about time the fans walked from Leafs Nation.
958899,FloatnFly,2016-02-22 15:24:00,1640,"Hockey is loosing fans from the people I talk too.   its because the NHL is too focused on building interest in the states, they've kinda let Canada go by the way side.

959307,Oggie,2016-02-24 15:19:00,588,TSN panel last night says 5 years to build a Leafs team that will make the playoffs on a consistent basis.  Go Jays Go!  I won't be following them at the end of 5 years and I'll bet the season ticket holders won't be either.  I always knew it would take a mass exodus by the fans to precipitate change.
959309,netminder,2016-02-24 15:35:00,514,Hockey is loosing fans from the people I talk too. A friend of mine used to work at Sportsnet and can confirm this. I say used to because he was recently laid off. Seems the $5 billion they spent on the hockey rights have gotten them very little in return. I bet they're thanking every god there is that the Jays are still relevant.
959316,leaf4,2016-02-24 15:58:00,2466,"Which is why they now can't afford to not sign bautista back, he helped make Canada care about baseball of all things lol"

960059,Oggie,2016-02-27 21:29:00,588,Well  trading REimer will make the tanking less obvious.  Looking over your shoulder Edmonton?  Disgraceful way to improve your odds of a first overall pick.  I wish Reimer all the best. He and his wife weren't treated very well in Toronto.  Bet he's smiling heading to a playoff team. His best hockey took place in the playoffs.
960060,Raf,2016-02-27 21:32:00,3495,"no surprise, he's a UFA, no real market for goalies right now and they're propably not willing to pay him what he wants.  they already have a tier ii goalie in bernier locked up."
960063,glen,2016-02-27 22:06:00,2641,Good for him. Can they get a good goalie when they need one.
960087,manitoubass2,2016-02-27 22:59:00,11391,Id say it unlikely.  What toronto needs is a draft pick to end up being a fantastic goaltender.  Not many move around these days and when they do its for big money on the downside of their careers

960097,leaf4,2016-02-27 23:32:00,2466,"He didn't rule out coming back, however unlikely there is a chance, a lot of teams are committed and he wants to be a number 1.  I hope they can draft or trade for a decent goalie prospect, cause trading for a starting goalie isn't always easy on the budget or the prospect/draft pool  Also I hope bibeau or sparks can fill the need for now and hopefully into the coming years develop real well, until either Bernie gets his groove back or they figure something out for the position"

957097,davey buoy,2016-02-10 22:00:00,5505,"I think they should sign Stamkos anyway if he is available. Sign him for 5-6 years,you will need a guy like that anyway. Build around him,he is still young enough and give the fans something to enjoy. The waiting I do not get."

To be fair, Crosby hadn't been up to a whole lot the first half of the season. And Pittsburgh is in a playoff spot right now while the Leafs, Sens, Habs, Jets, Oilers, Canucks, and Flames are all on the outside looking in. So no matter which Canadian team you cheer for Kessel is still better off lol.  More rumours heard this morning on the radio about Stamkos coming to the Leafs for next season, or maybe even at the trade deadline. I know there was a lengthy discussion about him earlier in this thread but I can't be bothered to go back and read it (lazy kids these days). My opinion on the matter is it doesn't really make sense to bring someone like him to the team now, unless he's going to be the only option for a top tier scorer the next 2-3 years. The Leafs aren't making the playoffs this year (no kidding) and probably not next year either. Before they blow their brains out on $12 mil/year on Stamkos they should make sure the supporting cast is actually going to be... supporting."

I believe he currently is in 42nd in scoring .....  certainly not a $12M / year player!!!  (but I do believe we will be signing him...just not sure for how much)"

Delusional laffites at it again   They didn't get where they are by signing free agents.  It was from tading draft picks and young talent for players of questional benefit.  Rask plus the six draft choices they gave up for Toskalo, Kessel, and Raycroft would be nice to have right now.  Signing a UFA for a reasonable contract isn't going to derail the rebuild."

957028,muddler,2016-02-10 12:22:00,623,The Leafs will purge even more players. Count on it. They want lots of draft picks and a huge surplus in the salary cap. Once all the pieces are in place they will go after players to complete the puzzle to become a serious contender. I'll give it 2 years. That's how winning teams are made. They are on the right track. They're not ready for Stamkos yet. That would just be a waste of money and future picks. Grit your teeth Leaf fans and wait.   muddler

957041,leaf4,2016-02-10 13:58:00,2466,"Agreed, for what stamkos brings, without the surrounding cast is a moot point and a hindrance to the salary cap when you can develop from within and get good young guys that are producing, at a cheaper rate and potentially lock them up long term at a good rate, like john klingberg in Dallas, they got a deal there, 22 years old 7 year 29.5 million dollar deal, 4.25 AAV that is a steal"

Last two seasons actually.   43 goals?  i hope they dont sign stamkos either...but you cant diss the guy lol  but stamkos isnt coming to toronto, the whole point of opening all of that money up is that gardiner, kadri, rielly all need to be signed within the next couple of years.  Leo isnt going to be the next captain, rielly is, everyone knows that already."
957044,dave524,2016-02-10 14:04:00,4508,Kadri??? trade him for some one that isn't a spoiled brat.

He's not going to right the ship himself but it's a damn good start. And we are talking about a free agent signing and not giving up picks in a trade.  You're telling me if Toews, Kane, Ovi, Malkin, Tavares, Seguin, Benn, or Crosby were available as a UFA you wouldn't want to sign him because your team is ""not ready"" and is in a rebuild?  There is no Conner McDavid in this coming draft or the next (at this point)... remember Nail Yakopov was highly praised and a #1 pick as well. No guarantees Austin Mathews will ever become even an elite player.  Only player on the Leafs now that should be signed and get his money is Reilly. Everyone else is expendable. I'll take Stammer at 11mill rather than Kadri at 5mill (which he will be asking for).  That being said.... can't understand why he would want to come to a team that is in a full rebuild when he is in the prime of his career. Regardless it will be very interesting if he doesn't sign with Tampa by the deadline........ As a die hard Leafs fan... I would take him in a heartbeat."
957058,manitoubass2,2016-02-10 16:33:00,11391,Well my son thinks the stamkos deal is already in the books.  And hes right on with this stuff most the time which is hilarious...  Time will tell but id love to see him in toronto
957060,AKRISONER,2016-02-10 16:50:00,5558,"guys guys guys...please pleaseeeeeee do not group me in with the kadri fans. I absolutely despise him.  In what world could you be a fan of a guy who dives, crys and gives up on plays after he gets hit or gets the puck taken away. He IMO is exactly whats wrong with Canadian Hockey. You have a bunch of pretty boy d bags trying to toe drag instead of going into the corners, playing body and putting the puck in the net.  Ive been praying for his failure all year so that he can go and ask for a bunch of money and they simply take him to arbitration and he ends up getting 2 million a year cause his stats suck."
957064,Acountdeleted,2016-02-10 17:43:00,2562,I'd rather they just trade Kadri away. Rebuild the entire culture not just the expensive pieces. Ship him to a team that will put up with his crap.
957066,Oggie,2016-02-10 17:53:00,588,"Lupul, as long as he can stay healthy, mature and well spoken individual. Lupul has lost his mojo and he should be a healthy scratch most games IMO."
957067,manitoubass2,2016-02-10 18:00:00,11391,Kadri has always acted with poor sportsmanship and seems to think hes a 100 point per year type of player.  I wouldnt want him as a teammate  I think Lupuls injuries have just caught up to him. Its too bad if thats the case because the talent and attitude are there to be a really good player
957074,AKRISONER,2016-02-10 18:57:00,5558,Lupul has lost his mojo and he should be a healthy scratch most games IMO.  he is definitely not 100% and is playing through it because if he took any more time off he will be out of the NHL
957076,glen,2016-02-10 19:39:00,2641,The leaf players suck. If management does everything right they will a playoff team in two years.
957084,leaf4,2016-02-10 20:53:00,2466,"I would say its a stretch for Leo to be the C, he is loved and admired by all (including myself) but I find him a longshot to be the guy who has to answer the questions at the end of the night, lupuls A was taken away and given to hunwick, so I doubt that, and rielly I think needs to be able to focus on his game before he moves into a leadership role. Naz no way, not a huge fan of his either.  IMO bozak or jvr are the options, maybe parentau or polak, polak I'm sure leads by example he's a very intense guy who shows up every day and never takes a second off"

Along with Phaneuf, the Leafs send forwards Matt Frattin, Casey Bailey, Ryan Rupert and defence prospect Cody Donaghey to the Senators in exchange for defenceman Jared Cowen, forwards Colin Greening, Milan Michalek and Tobias Lindberg as well as Ottawa’s second-round pick in the 2017 NHL Draft. No salary will be retained by either team over the trade’s entirety. Phaneuf, 30, has three goals and 24 points assists in 51 games with the Leafs this season. He has five years remaining on a seven-year contract he signed two seasons ago worth an average annual value of $7 million. Originally selected ninth overall by the Calgary Flames in 2003, Phaneuf has scored 120 goals and 424 points in 801 career games with the Flames and Maple Leafs. Toronto acquired Phaneuf from Calgary in a seven-player blockbuster in January of 2010 and he was named the 18th captain in franchise history prior to the 2010-11 season.   "

955410,netminder,2016-01-29 22:25:00,514,I think it's reasonable that a guy should have to sit out a game if they claim to be too injured to coast around during the all-star game. It's part of their obligation whether they like it or not.  And good for John Scott for sticking it to the league and actually going to the all star game. If you haven't read his essay on the player's tribune I highly suggest taking a few minutes to read it. It definitely opened my eyes. I'll be rooting for him for sure. Today on hockey central he said he was going to score 6 goals between the two games and he's participating in the hardest shot and claims he has a shot in excess of 103 mph. I can't wait to see that.  http://www.theplayerstribune.com/a-guy-like-me/
955470,fish_fishburn,2016-01-30 14:53:00,1311,I read it yesterday Netminder. I say good for him. NHL has egg on their face over this saga. They tried to make him look like a knuckle dragging thug without realizing he is a very articulate individual. I hope the Habs bring him up to shake things up a bit for that organization. I wonder who was the NHL isiot who phoned him and asked him if he thinks his kids would be proud of him for participating in the ASG. Im betting it came from Bettman. The league is a joke and he has to go.

951643,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-03 02:53:00,956,Leafs are 7-2-2 in last 11 games.  Playoffs here we come lol
951684,Oggie,2016-01-03 15:15:00,588,Don't really care if they make the playoffs but it sure is nice watching a team that plays a system.  You can actually see guys that know what their doing and depend on each other.  Nice to see Bernier returning to form. I never like watching a goalie losing his confidence.  BTW. Who ever commented late last year that the start of the long decline began with the loss of Kormarov was dead on! I never realized what a good all-around hockey player he is.  Babcock has certainly recognized it and someone on this thread did as well.  Bill M  I'm thinking???

951866,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-04 22:55:00,956,I like to see Komarov get some interest at the trade deadline later this year.  He would be a perfect fit for any team making a push for the cup.
952069,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-06 17:15:00,10439,As per the Leafs facebook page.  Leo Komarov has been named to an NHL All-Star and will represent the Maple Leafs in Nashville.

They can probably get a better return by trading him than they get for a weaker player.  A lot depends on his contract too.  If he becomes a UFA after the season then trading him now for someone who can help the team in two or three years may make sense."
952106,LostAnotherOne,2016-01-06 23:34:00,956,Big trade.  Seth Jones for Ryan Johanson.
952107,leaf4,2016-01-07 00:03:00,2466,"Wowowowow big trade! Both these guys have huge upside, though d men like Jones don't pop up every year.  On another note Lecavalier and Schenn for a prospect and a 3rd round pick, lol salary dump"

If he becomes a UFA after the season then trading him now for someone who can help the team in two or three years may make sense.   Leo is still locked up for 2 more years (at an incredible $2.95m / year).  UFA in the 2018-2019 season.  Leo will not be traded. Not even for a 1st round draft pick at trade deadline. The only teams that would want him (that would pay for him) would be teams making a run for the cup. If a team makes a run for the cup, that means they'll have a high draft pick. Trading Leo isn't even worth a 1st round pick above 18 or so....  Leo will be around for the length of his contract...and by that point, he will be revered like Gilmour or Clark was (not saying as good, just as revered) ... and he will be offered a long term contract to end his career with."

952231,Oggie,2016-01-07 19:40:00,588,Boy the Leafs sure can frustrate a team with that defensive style of play. I thought Anaheim was going to blow a gasket last night!  Bernier is returning to form and it's nice to see. My son was a goalie and I feel for them when they lose their confidence.  It's such a challenging position mentally.

950971,Steve,2015-12-28 17:45:00,2075,Another amazing year of World Junior Hockey! Some surprises already...some great hockey!  Matthews needs to step it up ... he isn't even in the top five right now in the tournament ....  But I think he will step it up.  Laine and Pulji are insane....wonder if one of them (likely Laine) will knock off Matthews from first overall.
947186,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-01 00:34:00,956,Prediction.  Sparks will get the win tonight and the goalie controversy will begin haha
947212,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-01 01:35:00,10439,Prediction.  Sparks will get the win tonight and the goalie controversy will begin haha  Pretty electric so far!!!
947235,Steve,2015-12-01 03:13:00,2075,good prediction!!  Sparks - great game. Komarov - another smokin' hot game. Phaneuf - strong game.
947241,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-01 04:26:00,10439,Welcome to the show junior!!!  http://www.tsn.ca/must-see/video/ford-must-see-best-bench-in-sports~760444
947260,BillM,2015-12-01 12:31:00,17367,"So happy for Sparks lastnight, nice to see some emotion!   Corporal Komarov just doesn't stop!  I hope he doesn't end up injured this year, he's been playing awesome."
947305,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-01 16:09:00,10439,Who would have thought he would be the Leafs leading scorer? I know I didn't.
947310,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-01 16:15:00,956,With Kessel leaving the top scoring leader was pretty much up for grabs.  Komarov lol.  He should get some attention at trade deadline if he keeps it up which I pretty much sure he will.  Sorry Steve
947320,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-01 17:01:00,10439,So the new kid has more wins than Bernier now after one game in the bigs!!!
947322,Acountdeleted,2015-12-01 17:03:00,2562,Haha. I never thought of that. Start planning the parade route!  The Spark-Knight (or sparknado) gets the next start too. Hope the kid stays hot.
947331,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-01 17:41:00,10439,Haha. I never thought of that. Start planning the parade route!  The Spark-Knight (or sparknado) gets the next start too. Hope the kid stays hot.   We now have Optimus Reim and The All Spark!!!
947501,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-02 17:48:00,10439,"HAHAHA!!!! Well that's embarrasking!!!!  http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=790703    The Toronto Maple Leafs announced today that the club has assigned goaltender Jonathan Bernier to the American Hockey League’s Toronto Marlies on a conditioning loan. Bernier has appeared in nine games with the Maple Leafs this season, posting a 3.28 goals against average and a .888 save percentage with a 0-8-1 record. In 184 career NHL games, Bernier owns a 76-75-21 record with a 2.66 goals against average and a .915 save percentage. The Maple Leafs return to the ice tonight in Winnipeg (7:30 p.m. ET) while the Marlies next game will take place Friday night when they travel to Rochester to take on the Americans."
947503,Acountdeleted,2015-12-02 17:52:00,2562,I love the leafs but here is where goalies come to die.  Raycroft Toskala Poggie Aubin Scrivins (Anyone want to chime in with the rest I am forgetting)  And now Bernier.  Edit: Tellquivst Gigurere Clemmensen Gerber Rynnas McDonald Gustavsson  ....... I think that's everyone.
947517,leaf4,2015-12-02 19:14:00,2466,"I wouldn't consider anyone of them starters except giggy, but he came in more so as a teacher and not to play a ton of games at that stage in his career, these were all poor management choices in either drafting or trades no matter how you slice it.  Bernier will be back on his feet soon enough"
947519,Dutch01,2015-12-02 19:20:00,1431,"He had better be, his stock is falling fast!"
947520,manitoubass2,2015-12-02 19:36:00,11391,Dodnt yall here don cherry?  Reimer is the best goaltender in the league
947524,Dutch01,2015-12-02 19:40:00,1431,"To be fair, he was the best goaltender in the league for about a week before he got hurt!"
947525,manitoubass2,2015-12-02 19:44:00,11391,Well maybe in short term stats...
947542,BillM,2015-12-02 21:15:00,17367,"Bernier will be back, goalies aren't allowed to have slumps in Toronto?"
947555,lookinforwalleye,2015-12-02 22:10:00,4399,if only the season was a week long....

947644,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-03 03:34:00,10439,So much for his 1.000 goals against average. The team played like crap in front of him all night.
947873,leaf4,2015-12-04 03:42:00,2466,"Great game played by the boys tonight, just couldn't get an allowed goal due to the offside challenge  that aside reimer was solid again"
948124,John Bacon,2015-12-05 20:42:00,3277,Maybe he can be the one to bring the cup back to Toronto  https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/desperate-for-backup-goalie--ahl-s-toronto-marlies-sign-zamboni-driver-133801048.html
948156,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-06 00:30:00,956,I'm thinking Sparks is going to be feed to the wolves tonight.  Best of luck
945094,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-17 17:01:00,956,"Am I the only one who doesn't want to see Edmonton win the cup ever.  I know there Canadian, but come on."
945096,Roy,2015-11-17 17:17:00,13728,"Yeah, that McDavid deal really helped them out too eh? They're already up to 29th place!"
945108,BillM,2015-11-17 17:41:00,17367,I hope McDavid finds a new home somewhere.
945109,Acountdeleted,2015-11-17 17:45:00,2562,Just once I'd like to see a premium star go elsewhere after their rookie contract. I was really hopeful with Tavares. Maybe McDavid?
945142,jimmer,2015-11-17 20:41:00,2730,Maybe Stamkos will make the leap????
945146,manitoubass2,2015-11-17 20:48:00,11391,Yes! Jump ship asap
945198,misfish,2015-11-18 01:00:00,29133,"It,s getting out of hand,,,,,,,,,,, Time out for all yas,,,,,,,,,,  "
945211,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-18 02:58:00,10439,Special teams are on fire tonight!!!! 4 PP and a shorty to lead the Aves 5-1 late in the 3rd. Bab's will be very happy although a few even strength goals would be nice.
945402,Oggie,2015-11-19 19:56:00,588,"So Kessel joins the Penguins and the dressing room looses it's cohesiveness.  HUH! There's a shock!  He is a coach killer with his poor attitude.  I'm sure Babcock made his trade part of his hiring conditions.  Sure don't missing him on this year's Leafs and I don't think his ""buddies"" miss him either.  Imagine him under Lou's thumb ...... might have been fun to watch for a while."
945412,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-19 20:31:00,4399,Kessel who????
945416,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-19 20:43:00,10439,Kessel who????   
945456,dave524,2015-11-19 22:22:00,4508,"Hear that Bernier is on the market, at least that rumour is circulating"
945467,leaf4,2015-11-19 23:05:00,2466,"You guys are silly, kessel is doing just fine"
945497,misfish,2015-11-20 01:12:00,29133,"Hear that Bernier is on the market, at least that rumour is circulating  That would be a silly thing right now.  Riem is shining and it,s so great to see. Both he and Bern can be a great duo. Lets let it wash out and see. Babs not a choker or quick trigger guy."
945825,muskymatt,2015-11-21 22:24:00,2608,I see the laffs are winning their way out of a draft pick! 20th overall would be nice!
945832,misfish,2015-11-21 22:53:00,29133,"I,ll take winning right now thank you."
946589,Oggie,2015-11-26 15:15:00,588,So the Leafs dropped to third in most valuable teams. Guess the fans are voting with their wallets.  More incentive to improve! Bet they don't settle at third place either. Momentum will carry them downward.  On a bright note they're sure more interesting to watch!  Can't believe Babcock can make that much difference but he seems too.
946602,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-26 16:48:00,4399,What difference they are a 25th place team....
946606,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-26 17:42:00,10439,"What difference they are a 25th place team....  The difference in the way they play the game. Better defense, more compete, breaking out of their own zone, puck posession. Give them a year or two and you will see them much higher in the standings. They are already a much different team than they were in the first few weeks of the season."
946618,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-26 19:28:00,4399,of course they are I was just poking fun....
946927,Steve,2015-11-28 20:00:00,2075,Leo vs Ovi  Can't wait!!!  Myself and three friends have great tickets....jersey's instead of suits...a nice change
946932,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-28 21:04:00,956,Lucky you Steve.  I always wanted to see Ovi live.
946960,Acountdeleted,2015-11-29 02:53:00,2562,Oilers vs Penguins 3 on 3 OT. This is some entertaining hockey.
946961,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-29 03:08:00,10439,"Yep, was fun to watch. Turned it on after watching the Bernier Show on CBC. Getting ready to watch the Jets game now."
946962,Acountdeleted,2015-11-29 03:10:00,2562,Only one that wasn't Berniers fault was the pinball goal. What a joke.
944551,Steve,2015-11-13 19:22:00,2075,"agreed.  outside of a select few games, the season has been a joy to watch so far."
944554,Headhunter,2015-11-13 20:06:00,5703,"If this winning keeps up, we might hear from MuskyMatt again! HH"
944556,muskymatt,2015-11-13 20:22:00,2608,"If this winning keeps up, we might hear from MuskyMatt again! HH They are riding a hot goalie at the moment, but we all know that won't last. I did see how the moved all the way up to 27th place, must be fascinating for the laffites to watch. I bet some are even having cup dreams I have no doubt that the goalies will start to suck again and the momentum will die off and they will ultimately end up where they belong. In the basement"
944557,manitoubass2,2015-11-13 20:46:00,11391,Thats where I want them this year?
944574,Acountdeleted,2015-11-13 22:50:00,2562,..... It won't? So you would be happy if they missed the playoffs by 2 points and picked 20th in next years draft?
944577,misfish,2015-11-13 23:05:00,29133,Riemanator is showing he can be the one.  I dont thing Bernie is seriously hurt. I think he dosent want to be part of a rebuilding team. Riem will take what he is given and roll. Just dont screw with his head Babs.
944731,Oggie,2015-11-14 19:58:00,588,Thats where I want them this year Me too but let's get to first place and then go into a free fall ........it's a tradition!

944873,misfish,2015-11-15 20:55:00,29133,Another 40 shot game against. Im sure many were just on the net. I dont get to excited when I hear these numbers. I would sooner see quality shots on net count.  Riems the man.
944896,manitoubass2,2015-11-15 23:15:00,11391,"All of us leafs fans, just like every year lol"
944924,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-16 01:45:00,10439,If we are going to get the #1 pick in the draft maybe we should sit Reims and let Bernier play all the remaining games.

944929,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-16 02:21:00,10439,I rolled my eyes so hard on that 1/2 court goal I think I pulled something!!!

We already have a very solid core of youth that will form tomorrow's team.  IF we missed the playoffs by 2 points, with the team we currently have, and BY NOT bringing up all our marlies, than we would no doubt see huge improvements from guys like Kadri, JVR, Bozak, and Rielly.  That is a good thing.  Of course the Leafs are not going to ""miss the playoffs by 2 points"" ... but whether they finish last, second to last, or whatever, I don't care....I just want to see them do the best they can.....whatever that may mean."

943534,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-05 22:16:00,10439,So Patrick Kane seems to be in the clear!  Although I did read the chick could potentially file a civil suit for stress etc (which she would more than likely lose because she was the one who came forth with the allegations)  He should sue her for defamation of character and undue stress as well as anything else his lawyers can come up with. With the info that has come out it's pretty clear this chick was just looking for a pay day.  The best piece of info was that the sexual assault kit showed 2 different male donors and neither was Kane!!!!
943536,davey buoy,2015-11-05 22:33:00,5505,"Agreed,but there will still be a part of him that most people will remember.defamation of character for ever.He needs to fight this to the end ,it will stay with him forever ,even knowing it wasn't him.Some will never accept the fact he was cleared.Very sad."
943537,leaf4,2015-11-05 22:35:00,2466,"Yup, I find it ridiculous the way he was painted in the press, it was guilty before proven innocent the way the media portrayed it, and how stupid do all the fans that chanted at him ""she said no"" and ""no means no""  Also for anyone that wants to read into my comments and say he might still be guilty they just can't prove it... Exactly, no one but him and her will actually know 100% what happened that night, but with the DNA evidence its very strongly suggesting nothing happened"

944268,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-11 19:42:00,4399,Really charged and JAILED....no trial ....Mr.Kane was pretty tip lipped all the way along and his team did not want this to go to trial so they got what they wanted....we will probably never know the whole story now!!!

944548,Oggie,2015-11-13 18:37:00,588,Fun team to watch! They never seem to quit.  I liked the shot of the bench last night between the end of the 3 on 3 and the shoot-out. Lots of smiles and good chemistry!  I think they've finally found a coach that knows how to manage the individuals on this team.
942180,Acountdeleted,2015-10-28 16:52:00,2562,"Took the words out of my mouth Ark. Babcock knew it will be 3 years minimum, probably more like 5 and that these first 2 years would be the dark ages. That being said, if you can build a good culture of never giving up now, the young guys will have a standard to live up to when they get to the Pros. THAT is what has been the problem the last 10 years, and why guys like Kadri, Schenn and the like have only been sub-par."
942972,muskymatt,2015-11-02 00:00:00,2608,Anyone know how the laffs are doing?  Reminds me of a good joke.  What goes 1-7-2 Thud?      The laffs hitting rock bottom! 
942974,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-02 00:07:00,10439,"Anyone know how the laffs are doing?  Reminds me of a good joke.  What goes 1-7-2 Thud?      The laffs hitting rock bottom!   Yep!!! Things are going perfectly!!! Lot better chance @ the #1 draft pick finishing in the basement. Don't expect to see a lot of improvement for at least a couple of years.  By that time the Sens if they're lucky will be able to say ""well we gave it a good go but lost in the 1st round again""."
943030,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-02 14:35:00,4399,Who cares the Habs are 11-2....
943032,netminder,2015-11-02 14:41:00,514,"Who cares the Habs are 11-2.... As a fellow habs fan, yes this is true. But they are due for a correction soon too."
943038,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-02 16:03:00,956,"I got to admit it the Habs are a pretty good team.  I would put them at the top of the league, but we will see if they are a championship team or not.  More pressure on the Habs then any other Canadian team right now."
943040,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-02 16:25:00,10439,They did look very strong against the Jets last night. I thought it would have been a much closer game than it was.

I'd say by 2018-2019 we'll see the playoffs....  and by 2019-2020 we'll see a true Cup run...."
943109,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-03 00:48:00,4399,A NHL caliber starting goalie would certainly help....
943160,Acountdeleted,2015-11-03 17:27:00,2562,Someone didn't get the memo. Leafs weren't supposed to beat Dallas.  Still an enjoyable game. Good to see a few lucky bounces.
943175,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-03 18:10:00,10439,They played a decent game last night. Was nice to see a full 60 minute effort. The only thing I didn't like was the shots against count. Was too high and looking like last year again.
943192,lookinforwalleye,2015-11-03 19:24:00,4399,Dallas is very beatable...there goaltending is very ordinary....on the other hand the Habs back up goalie is leading the league...albeit a small sample size!!!!
943265,Steve,2015-11-04 00:39:00,2075,I think we'll take any win we can get  Dallas is a good team.  2 wins..it's a start lol

I've seen my share of ""rebuilds"" over the years and maybe, they will get it right this time. History suggests it's unlikely though. I bet the folks at Bell are drooling over the tv numbers the Jays drew and I get that the Jays are a national team, but the Leafs draw well across the country and should they ever get to the playoffs and deep into them, the numbers would be huge. With that said, I have to wonder how long Bell is going to sit around and wait for the current regime to show some consistent winning.

Why didn't I think of that? That's what the problem is....the leafs need a larger rink.  I wonder how long Babs is going to last....He's starting to stutter in his post game interviews.

941931,Steve,2015-10-27 02:07:00,2075,Babcock will be around for many more years.  As will Shanny and Lamoriello.
942029,muddler,2015-10-27 20:48:00,623,I like the comments that Babcock made to the Leafs. Finally a coach that says it the way it is.  http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/27/babcock-lays-into-leafs-after-yet-another-loss  I agree 100%. That work ethic and desire to win is a must at the pro level. Never mind the score. The fans come to watch a hockey game that demonstrates the best of the best (pros). Just mailing it in is NOT acceptable. I'll watch PeeWees if the players are NOT giving up.  Way ta go Babs. I may become a Leaf fan yet.
942039,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-27 21:22:00,10439,You got that right. He tells it like it is and holds everyone accountable. I was very happy when Babs signed on as the Leafs coach and this is the reason why. He will given time mold the Leafs into a winner. Just watch.  He is right that the team did not play well last night like they had in previous games this year. His dressing room speech during the second intermission did some good though as the team picked it up in the third.  PK in the last couple of games as well as inconsistent goal tending are big issues.  GO LEAFS GO!!
942052,Steve,2015-10-27 22:23:00,2075,"I know, I sound like a broken record, but ... the Leafs played a decent game.... We stunk for a bit, but picked it up in the end, making a good run at it.  How long has it been since we saw the Leafs actually come back in a game...last few years we'd play a strong couple periods, and collapse in the 3rd...like clockwork .  Now we have a structure that motivates the team to give it their all right to the end. Good coaching!"
942054,manitoubass2,2015-10-27 22:25:00,11391,"Second year of peewee and mah boy got a hat trick first game!!! Nice goals too, two back hands bar down and a one timer from the slot!  I love the NHL but kids hockey is friggen awesome!!!!"

All the dads go out and play with kids on off days and it sure makes a difference!  Look at some of the local areas players, we have wicked development. Toews, keith etc.  Its soo fun to watch!  I was a good hockey player, and my son is already twice what I was at his age"

Part of the reason might be there is now zone triple A teams.  They draw the best rep players off of many of the local teams. The local teams draw the best players out of house league.  And the House League well ..........you saw the result.  I feel for the good player stuck at the lower level (usually becasue of finances) with no good players to play with.  Hard to develop when your wingers can't skate."
942165,Oggie,2015-10-28 15:22:00,588,I worry about Babcock's energy level. The slugs can wear a good coach out!!  I'm not concerned about his job security more about his sanity.  Time for Shannie to send a message. Somebody has got to go and I'd suggest it be the guy wearing the C.  That will send a message.
942171,AKRISONER,2015-10-28 16:05:00,5558,lol to people thinking babcock is shook...he took the job knowing this exactly what was going to happen...why do you think they sent all of their best players down to the AHL...everything is going perfectly according to plan.

Kasperi Kapanen, Jesse Puljujarvi, and Leo Komarov from the Finns and of course William Nylander, a Canadian / Swede.  Jesse is a huge young man, who loves to throw his weight around, while still scoring....similar to Leo, but likely better.

940949,muddler,2015-10-21 23:15:00,623,"That's what the other 29 other teams are doing too. It is the culture if the team that has to change, I've said it here for years.

940055,Steve,2015-10-17 01:37:00,2075,"great game.  Love that Leo made it official.  another fantastic, entertaining Leafs game.  love this season so far.  edit: and Leo follows up with the open net goal....great game boys, great game!"
940058,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-17 02:06:00,10439,T'was another good game. They looked very good tonight. Starting to pick up on Bab's system.
940281,dave524,2015-10-17 23:36:00,4508,"Wow, went to go to the Leafs game after baseball, finally found it on City TV , how weird is that."
940350,Steve,2015-10-18 14:44:00,2075,"well, we lost by a goal, but another great game....pvr'd and watched when I got home last night....  Leo continues to shine  :)  7 hits and a goal."
940371,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-18 16:21:00,956,Everything is going to plan in Leaf land.  Yes
938904,glen,2015-10-10 12:45:00,2641,So the first two games I tried to watch but could not get past the half way mark. It hurts my eyes.
938922,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-10 17:42:00,10439,So the first two games I tried to watch but could not get past the half way mark. It hurts my eyes.  Obviously you are not watching the games properly. Sounds like there is a lack off booze involved here!!! I managed to watch the whole game but it took a few extra drinks!!!!
938923,Steve,2015-10-10 17:52:00,2075,"Watched the Ticats win last night at ivor wynne.  But if I wasn't there, I would have been watching the Leafs, with a smile on my face...  You know, like a fan would."
938924,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-10 18:26:00,956,"Was suppose to see the Ticats with Scott last night Steve, but I'm fighting a cold.  Not sure if you saw him there.  This year is probably going to be the toughest for me as a Leaf fan.  Hate to want my fav team to lose, but its for the best I think."
938927,Steve,2015-10-10 18:40:00,2075,the stadium was electric last night....great game !!!
938958,muskymatt,2015-10-10 22:35:00,2608,"Was suppose to see the Ticats with Scott last night Steve, but I'm fighting a cold.  Not sure if you saw him there.  This year is probably going to be the toughest for me as a Leaf fan.  Hate to want my fav team to lose, but its for the best I think. I don't think you wanting them to lose is going to make a difference. They WILL LOSE, and , A LOT!  So I'm curious. Why is this year going to be tougher than the last 50?"
938968,leaf4,2015-10-10 23:18:00,2466,"Because they're going to lose, a lot and shouldn't be close to being competitive.  They have an ok first line and d pairing, past that, the rest of the team is 3rd liners at best"
938971,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-10 23:27:00,956,After picking up Marner in the draft this year and with Reilly and Nylander its looking like they have a good future.  If they keep sucking there going to get another top five pick.  Its all about rebuilding muskymatt.  The Leafs are looking a lot brighter then those Sens for the future.
938973,Steve,2015-10-10 23:38:00,2075,"they are going to do just fine....  they are handling joke teams like Ottawa, I'm sure they'll do just fine with some real teams."
938976,LostAnotherOne,2015-10-10 23:48:00,956,Anybody see Max Domis performance last night.  Goal and assist.  Tie must be smiling
938983,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-11 00:21:00,10439,"Anybody see Max Domis performance last night.  Goal and assist.  Tie must be smiling  Yeah, the kid is awesome!!! Was fun to watch."

938985,darsky,2015-10-11 00:25:00,586,Hows that working for ya?????  Laffs suck! all academic anyways because they will both end up losing to the 'Abs anyways

939016,Steve,2015-10-11 02:38:00,2075,"left to go for dinner with the wife at end of first period...  thankfully we picked a place where I could watch the game on the tv's.  when we were down 3-0, I thought things were grim. But this is where I think the coaching staff shined. I saw Babcock work that bench, up and down, providing confidence on the bench.  3 unanswered goals by the boys in blue. I was proud. 3rd period when we went down by one, fought hard, and managed to tie it up...to bring it to overtime. great stuff!  This is great hockey.  It was a fantastic game, and if I get to watch another 80 of those, I'm going to be a happy camper this year"
939244,misfish,2015-10-12 20:00:00,29133,"So the Habs beat the Leafs, Sens beat the Leafs. The Habs beat the Sens and the Leafs.  Must be nice to be proud Hab fans."

You wake up tomorrow morning and you are in 2045. You know you will be back to 2015 the day after. Forget about everything else, do you look to see if the leafs won the cup in the past 30 years?"
939486,manitoubass2,2015-10-13 21:13:00,11391,I agree  He obviously has that passion and the skill set behind it.  Not often a rookie comes up and makes vets look that bad  Good on him?

If it had been caught when it happened it may have been called a penalty, but no penalties will be called after the fact with the coaches challenge."

Now how is that not a penalty?  big thing I noticed last night was as serious and intense as Babcock is, there was a play where two shots were blocked in a row and then the zone got cleared, and a whistle blue for offside, the camera zoomed in on both guys coming off gingerly and as they sat down, you saw babcock run all the way down the bench and congratulate both guys for doing the right thing. He didnt leave it to the players to congratulate them or their respective defensive/offensive coach.  As a hockey player myself, those moments are the type that get you motivated, be it your captain or your coach come down and taking notice of you making the right play.  Good stuff."
938710,Steve,2015-10-08 16:27:00,2075,Last night's game was absolutely fantastic!  Great Energy.  Strong playing.  Proud of the boys in blue

938820,muskymatt,2015-10-09 15:50:00,2608,Sens 1-0 Laffs 0-1 get used to it 
938828,DRIFTER_016,2015-10-09 17:24:00,10439,HEY!!!! KESSEL is leading the PENs in +/-!!!!  He has 0!!!!

938894,leaf4,2015-10-10 03:27:00,2466,I'm glad you think they're going to win the cup cause none of us do!  Just shows your delusion in being a sens fan

938903,Acountdeleted,2015-10-10 12:29:00,2562,What muskymatt doesn't realize is this is what a proper rebuild looks like. This is exactly what I expect from the Leafs this year. I'm probably not going to watch many games but this needs to be done. Groom the kids and hopefully add a few more in the next 2-3 years.
937015,tb4me,2015-09-28 22:02:00,3295,Well the only thing consistent about Boyes is his inconsistency and he has had 1- 20 goal season since 2008....but hey somebody will have to score on this team so he might get 20 again...having said that it is a low risk move for a team going no where....the main thrust to my message was regarding you suggesting they could trade him at the deadline for a first round pick....sorry but that is just crazy my friend!!!! Id love you to explain the difference between Brad Boyes and Mason Ramond? Please do tell then  I will elaborate here.. Boyes last year had 14 goals 24 assists 38 points and a plus 11 Raymond last year had 12 goals 11 assists 23 points and a -23 The nucks bought him at the deadline for a first rounder.. are you saying that Vancouver is stupid? Or are you saying that no buying team at the deadline would never do that again? Shanny and Lou know a little more about hockey then you give them credit for..
937018,lookinforwalleye,2015-09-28 22:24:00,4399,What is your fascination with Mason Raymond??? The guy has had 1- 20 goal season in his career....and again there is not a GM in the NHL that would give up his first pick for Boyes....  There is nothing wrong with signing Boyes...the Habs are trying the same thing with Semin and perhaps Fleischman....

This is that part where I have to eat crow now..Raymond walked a free agent..my mistake..I confused him with Santorelli.. My bad and I appoligise...lol
937074,Jigger,2015-09-29 01:38:00,1237,"Fact is, all of the free agents that the Leafs signed are deadline commodities. This includes the trade for Grabner. All will be bit pieces to be pawned for picks.  I hope they don't get Matthews. He'll fly to Phoenix after a year. They need a stud Dman to pair with Reilly, the guy from Sarnia gets high praise. Chyuchin i think?"
937094,grimsbylander,2015-09-29 10:01:00,3016,Takes a lot of balls and knowledge to predict that Kessel will score more goals playing for the Pens with Crosby vs. The Leafs. LOL!!!

936856,craigdritchie,2015-09-28 01:50:00,1586,"Time for my annual prediction, and if you read my annual predictions over the past several years you will realize this is in no way influenced by the simple fact the Loafs got their backsides handed to them by the Habs last night.  I predict:  Loafs will be totally on fire in November and early December, when it doesn't really matter. In January they will start to slide, by February the excuses will be flying and fingers will be pointing, and by the end of March they will be booking tee times. But as always, they will be absolutely unbeatable for the last two weeks, climbing in the standings just enough to ensure they don't even get a good draft pick, and encouraging Loaf fans to all say wow, did you see them when they started to click? Next year, baby, next year! Plan the parade route!  And that's all I have to say for this thread, See you all in April."
936858,leaf4,2015-09-28 01:57:00,2466,"Another one of those who put words in the mouths of fans, I don't think any actual fan would agree with a thing you just said, have you looked at the leafs roster? How on earth would anyone expect them to be ""on fire"" they have an ok 1st line at best, and the rest of the team are prospects and career 3rd liners lol... Always gotta be one guy I guess"
936863,glen,2015-09-28 02:19:00,2641,It is going to be unwatchable.  9 out of 10 I get put to sleep.

936908,BillM,2015-09-28 15:05:00,17367,Haven't you heard?  Kessel isn't going to score anything this year according to some
936919,Acountdeleted,2015-09-28 15:52:00,2562,"Wow. People have nooooo clue how actual leaf fans are thinking are they?  The over/under most fans are putting out for the leafs is 32 games. I don't think they will hit it. We have almost no scoring and the Defense is still growing and maturing.  This will be a great year for Babcock to see who he wants to keep around in 3-5 years when this team is legit ready.  Believe me boys, this year, no one in Toronto is going to be saying 'Wow! Did you see that?'  But whatever helps you sleep at night."

Everyone will say wow did you see that when Uncle Lou signs Stamkos...lol one can wish..As for Matts comment..Honestly Matt Boyes is a 20 goal guy in Florida and is from Toronto.. We paid 700K for a year..Much like Mason Raymond last year he will be dealt at the deadline and get a good first round pick for him, from a buying team looking to go on a run..Its a win win and Shanny has that figured out already..If you ask me and 90% of the hockey world you can see Boyes was a great deal..."
936966,jimmer,2015-09-28 19:26:00,2730,"This Leaf fan is still hoping they bottom out for a chance at the Matthews kid in June. It will be interesting to see what Babcock can get out of these guys. I hope Reilly doesn't get damaged with a season they are heading into. I have a neighbour who thinks they will be great and make it to the playoffs, always the optimist and typical Leaf fan."
936973,lookinforwalleye,2015-09-28 19:53:00,4399,Well they were not really beating Boyes door down in the off season were they.....But you are the eternal optimist when it comes to the Leafs and the things they do.....and if you think they will get a first round pick for Boyes you are crazier than Musky Matt.....  :clapping:

Leafs have 4 roster spots available and a crap load of cap space.."
937001,lookinforwalleye,2015-09-28 21:31:00,4399,Well the only thing consistent about Boyes is his inconsistency and he has had 1- 20 goal season since 2008....but hey somebody will have to score on this team so he might get 20 again...having said that it is a low risk move for a team going no where....the main thrust to my message was regarding you suggesting they could trade him at the deadline for a first round pick....sorry but that is just crazy my friend!!!!

936145,tb4me,2015-09-23 21:45:00,3295,this just keeps getting better and better.. UPDATE: Erie County Central Police Services commissioner John Glascott released a statement regarding today's developments in the Kane case. All evidence related to this case that was given to Erie County Central Police Services by the Town of Hamburg Police Department is accounted for and remains in its original packaging in the possession of Erie County Central Police Services. This includes the evidence in the rape kit and the packaging itself. This evidence has been analyzed and reports of that analysis sent to the appropriate agencies.
936160,BassMan11,2015-09-23 22:49:00,583,"Looks like the procecution is grasping at straws. There Doesnt seem to be any DNA evidence coming from leaked information. Let's also remember Mr. Kane is such a mess that he actually has a retired police officer chauffeur him around to keep him out of trouble.  If they do find something and he is guilty I hope he gets everything coming to him.  If not, and they find out the victim was just looking for a payout, I hope the media ruins her life as well."

He won't go into a corner,  won't stand up for teammates, won't stand up for himself unless he can hack at the other guys legs  and this morning in the Sun they are saying 40 goals.  Ha ha ha.  In a way(ok, a small way) I feel bad for Kessel because he's in a no win situation. If he goes out and has a 40 goal season, the crowd will be all over him for the reasons quoted above. If he lights it up along side Crosby, it'll be Crosby who gets the credit, which to a certain extent is true. Hell, I could score a goal if Crosby banked it off my a$$. Kessel's super talented, he just needs to play on a line that can carry his weaknesses."
936522,leaf4,2015-09-25 18:45:00,2466,"I don't think he's in a no win situation in anyway at all, he's been put in a position to succeed and even management has stated they just want him to worry about playing his game, not the media or carrying the team like he did in the blue and white, the only way he doesn't win is if he doesn't form chemistry with Crosby or malkin, but he already got 2 goals (albeit preseason goals) and yes they were assisted by Crosby, but look at crosby's point totals, always more assists than goals, he is a playmaker before a scorer and a selfless player in terms of goals, he doesn't care whether its his goal or anyone else's as long as its his teams"

Its easy to have contempt for them because of what they have and appearances, but they work extremely hard for what they do and have devoted a hell of a lot more time and effort and made sacrifices to be able to do what they love for work, and when people get the chance to draw blood, some will.  As far as hockey players being the worst, very doubtful.  Ignorance is bliss I guess, so many hockey players, so many drinking and drug problems, and so much promiscuity.  Its the dark side of proffesional sports that only rears its head so often, but even then some of the greats have fallen in a lot of sports.  You think the whole crap thats going on in LA is a one off case?  Ill make a point that you can usually tell which guys are the ones that get involved with all of that garbage vs the ones that keep a clean nose (per say) and work their butts off."

934921,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-17 23:12:00,956,I heard today that it has to go before a grand jury (23 people) and they decide if its going to go to court or not.  If its goes to court he can settle so nothing happens.  Basically he pays he to be quiet about the whole thing and charges are dropped.  Its messed up I know.

934924,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-17 23:23:00,956,Hated him ever since he assaulted that cab driver a few years back.  My dads been a cabby for 40 years so it hit a nerve.
934954,tb4me,2015-09-18 02:40:00,3295,"Folks if he buys her out, that has to be an admission of guilt in the leagues eyes...Then the question is does the NHL allow him to get away with that? Do they want that talked about every game for the next year and a half...I dont think he will be allowed to play a regular season game at all..I honestly think Chicago is forcing the league to deal with it. Take for example Nascar and Kurt Busch, Chevrolet and Nascar both suspended him indefinitely until his name was cleared..He was found innocent and missed 4 races this year including the Daytona 500..This was for a supposed assault..She claimed he grabbed her by the neck..This is potential rape here..Buy out is not an option for him..He has to clear his name..But thats just my opinion...lol"
934955,manitoubass2,2015-09-18 02:46:00,11391,"Just my opinion...  If he sexually assualted a girl his status and money shouldnt matter;jail time  If this girl is lying, she is in contempt of court and guilty of extortion;jail time"

935006,AKRISONER,2015-09-18 13:44:00,5558,"its amazing what happens when you give a bunch of boys a pile of money and fame...they feel like the rule the world.  Id argue Hockey is one of the worst sports for behaviour of its athletes. Considering that unlike football and basketball where a large majority of players grew up in really rough environments, most hockey players have suburban parents carting them around in luxury SUV's to games their whole childhood.  They then get taken away from school and home at 16 to go play hockey for the rest of their lives...you end up with a bunch of 25 year olds with 16 year old sensibilities and way too much money running around.  I have stories about teams and players from my best friend that are just ridiculous. (he worked at a bar that visiting teams in Ottawa always frequented)"

935462,leaf4,2015-09-20 21:27:00,2466,"Agreed. Its easy to have contempt for them because of what they have and appearances, but they work extremely hard for what they do and have devoted a hell of a lot more time and effort and made sacrifices to be able to do what they love for work, and when people get the chance to draw blood, some will.  As far as hockey players being the worst, very doubtful."
935463,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-20 21:27:00,10439,First pre-season games of the 2015-2016 season tonight!! Leafs play the Sens tomorrow night. On TSN4&5.
934292,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-14 16:24:00,956,Ok guys another season is coming upon us.  Let the trash talk begin.  Go Leafs Go
934305,fish_fishburn,2015-09-14 17:03:00,1311,The leafs have a wicked team (front office) this year. They should do well.lol
934311,Steve,2015-09-14 17:54:00,2075,Go Leafs Go.  Can't wait for the first person to blame the leafs success (or lack thereof) on their horrible fans who fill the arena year after year (and will again this year).
934313,Craigson,2015-09-14 18:09:00,117,Looking forward to a new season. I think this is the year Galchenyuk breaks out. We shall see
934320,Oggie,2015-09-14 18:54:00,588,"You know it's going to be a long year when Hockey Magazine (can't remember the specific name) says the first line for the Leafs will be JVR, Kadri and sorry can't remember the winger.  Kadri on the first line ........we might get that first pick over all!"
934341,DRIFTER_016,2015-09-14 21:36:00,10439,The 2015/2016 Leafs TV schedule is out.  http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=778983  
934491,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-15 16:46:00,956,So the guys I'm going to be watching this year is probably McDavid and Kessel.  Lets see how McDavid does against grown men and with Kessel to see if he can hit a career high in goals hopefully.  Even seeing how Eichel does his first year.  He could very well challenge for the Calder.
934557,tb4me,2015-09-15 21:36:00,3295,Did anyone catch Hitchcock on Leafs lunch today? He says he wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if the leafs made the playoffs this year..He also said to expect a speedy rebuild with the group of guys running the show now..Stamkos to leafs..I hear Yzerman may trade him rather then loose him at years end..
934582,LostAnotherOne,2015-09-16 00:06:00,956,You never know what Babcock can do for the Leafs.  Hopefully they bomb it for a season or two and pick up some decent picks to add to what they already have.  This will be the toughest season for me at least cause I'm hoping they lose every game.

934613,muddler,2015-09-16 12:05:00,623,"Ok guys another season is coming upon us.  Let the trash talk begin.  Go Leafs Go Then this shouldn't be called a ""HOCKEY thread"" but rather a ""Leafs thread"".  It isn't trash talk when a team lacks a consistent work ethic. As I and others have said, work hard the whole time and play 60 minutes and we'll all enjoy the sport. Something the laffs have lacked for so many years.  The Jays have captured Canada. Why? Well if you look closely they NEVER give up. Jose Bautista typifies what a winner is. He always plays  (offence and defence) like the Jays are behind by one rune and that what he does will change the outcome of the match. He leads by example , ALL the time. Can the Laffs say that for the last dozen years? When they all play with heart ALL the time, I'll stop bashing them. It doesn't matter if they win by 10 goal or loose by 10 goal as long as they work 100% of the time. In the mean time I'll cheer for any team the does that.  Now let's have a real hockey thread.  muddler"

That's all I really want.  im most excited to watch some very very talented young players build their game. There will be flashes of brilliance for sure, some of nylander's highlights from rookie camp are unbelievable...it will be interesting to see how much of that he can bring into the NHL."
934631,davew3,2015-09-16 13:57:00,430,"I am waiting to see how long it takes for the buzz in Pittsburgh to fade.  He won't go into a corner,  won't stand up for teammates, won't stand up for himself unless he can hack at the other guys legs  and this morning in the Sun they are saying 40 goals.  Ha ha ha."

934639,manitoubass2,2015-09-16 14:33:00,11391, Its gonna be fun to watch!!!!  Also imo Eichel has a better chance at the calder this season than mcdavid.  Cant wait for hockey this year! Of course Im a leafs fan but I follow a few teams as well.  I just have a feeling this is gonna be a great season!!!

934675,davew3,2015-09-16 18:58:00,430,"Look at the division the Pens are in.   One of the toughest, physical in the league.   I am a Leaf fan so I was happy to hear when he was traded.  Now if the front staff can pull in more quality players.  Put a defence in front of their goalies. It should be interesting.  But the Leafs need a fighter (s).  I do not agree to ban fighting.  If they do then they have to make the penalties hurt the players and the team that take the cheap shots. Liberties if you will.  If Toronto had some decent enforcers last year it may have turned out different.  regards"
