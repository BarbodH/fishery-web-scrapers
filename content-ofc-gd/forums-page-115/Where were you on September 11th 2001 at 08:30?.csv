Used to live down the road from my grandparents and her father used to hunt on their property) from down the hall come in and say that a plane had hit the WTC, and another one did soon after. The early suspicion was there was a poor visibility day and the one plane was trying to follow the other and both ended up hitting the buildings. No one anticipated it being a jetliner, more like a Cessna. I honestly can't remember what happened the rest of the day, but it couldn't have been much. Everyone was pretty distracted, to say the least."

I'm still opening my Hortons when he says turn on the radio, a plane hit the World Trade Center in New York and its on fire. I had a small clock radio in my office and there were three or four of us huddled around it, listening, when the second plane hit. And all I could think of - selfishly, I admit - was I don't know what's going on, but man am I ever glad to be home."

I was working on transitioning to a new company and by myself in the office. My new boss was working from an office, three blocks away. My mother in law called me to tell me of the first plane. I trotted down to the coffee shop on the main floor, as I knew they had tv's throughout the shop. I was standing there, sipping my coffee, when the 2nd plane hit... strangest thing I have ever seen. I went back to work, hoping someone from my new company would call and let me know what their plans were, and I waited.... About two hours into it, I finally decided to call myself and was told that they had forgotten about me and that they had already sent everyone home!!!!! Rumours at the time were that Toronto's financial district would likely be a target as well, so, I locked up and went home to watch the events unfold. My wife, pregnant at the time was in tears, thinking that the world was about to end and is this the kind of world we want to bring a child into? A remarkable day to be sure.... HH"

I remember, no-one could fathom what they were seeing right in front of them on television, but there was still conversation happening in the room. And then it happened..........the first tower collapsed, any conversation had stopped abruptly, and the whole room deflated. The unfathomable turned to surreal, people were just walking out of the room with an almost panicked yet subdued look on their face, like they just werent all there. Tears, disbelief, anxiety, just numbness all around. I remember people just going back to their desks to gather their breif cases and purses, and without a word to their managers or higher ups.........just walking out from their jobs for the day.

981442,DanD,2016-09-13 17:17:00,2223,"You don't need to look all the way to the Middle East to see or feel how some felt that day. I moved into my house 28 years ago and over those years there has been many new Canadians move into the neighbourhood; mostly Lebanese. The family right next door to me had a group of their friends sitting in a semi circle on the front lawn; passing around a hookah pipe that afternoon. They were speaking Arabic, laughing and every once and awhile we'd hear them cheer? I took the dog for a walk and found out what the cheering was all about; they were watching the news reports on a portable tv. Every time they'd play a plane hitting one of the towers or the towers coming down they would cheer as if they were watching a sports game and their team just scored. I went in the house called the cops; where I was told they couldn't do anything. They did send a cruiser and the cop did get out and talked to them; where their little party did break up. Before 9/11 the women wore western clothes and most did not have their head covered; the men were mostly clean shaven. Since then 90% of the women are dressed more Eastern and I have never seen the neighbour without her head covered. For at least 5 years after 9/11 he and most of the Lebanese men had full beards. I'm only speaking of what I have seen and lived with; I'm not trying to paint everyone with the same brush; but they do live among us.  Dan.   "

There might not be a single Muslim family in our county, what a difference from the city and here rurally. If there is I don't know where. We must not paint all with the same brush like Dan said. When I was a kid growing up in a Wasp neighbourhood and one of only 2 Catholics going to a Wasp school I was painted by the same brush and it hurts badly. When the survey I grew up in was built a few years before we moved within it there was an application to buy a home, no Jews, Negroes or Catholics, I have seen it. I should have kept it.  Shortly after 911 I was called by an engineering consulting firm to work with manufacturing companies that were vulnerable to terrorism (sabotage). It was unbelievable how easy it would have been to cause several millions of dollars damage as well as put many lives in jeopardy if someone knew what button to push or valve to turn and could walk right into these plants right off the street. I hope things haven't gone back to the lax ways we were in pre 911."

I was up at 5am and got the grapefruit cut and ready. Heated up the skillet for eggs and klick.  Woke gramps up at 530am and we had our grapefruit, then klick and eggs.  Next up was always cbc then cnn for an hour or so.  Gramps hit the washroom and thats when the first plane hit.  I never bothered him because in all honesty I thought it was one of those CNN docu movie type things.  By the time I realised that it was real we barely left our chairs.  By 530pm I went on a beer run and gramps asked for a 12 pack instead of his 4 pack. I bought a case, knowing he was shook and it was gonna be a long night.  That was one of three times I seen my grampa cry, one talking about being in ww1, two when gma died.

981272,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-11 05:42:00,8243,"""A date that will live on in infamy"". That's what FDR said when addressing the nation after the Pearl Harbor attack. My wife called me about 8:30 or so on her brick Motorola shoe phone as she drove to her job in Hamilton. She told me to turn on CNN  because Q 107 broke in programming with news that a small plane accidently crashed into the World Trade Center. The first thing I did was look outside and saw Blue Bird skies. Maybe in NY it was fogged in. What I saw on TV for the next 3 days was what everyone else saw. In the next few hours I tried to call my 1st cousin in New Jersey as well as relatives in NY state only to hear the nert, nert, nert of a busy signal. My family was under attack. My US born Mother answered in Hamilton just after 9 AM when the first tower collapsed. She said it was the same feeling she had as a 10 year old listening to the radio after Pearl Harbor on the radio. I shared her feeling. A feeling I never thought I would have. She was in a panic as she couldn't reach any of my Uncles and Aunts.  About 1 PM I went into town to return a DVD still in a surreal mental fog. The town is sleepy on any day but it was empty that afternoon. The lady at the ""In and Out"" store in Selkirk had no idea what had happened 4 hours latter as she was doing what she does at the store with her Mom. When I told her what had happened she broke into tears. Her husband had just gone to NY city the day before and she wondered why she didn't hear from him that morning. Bruce was fine but she waited a day to hear from him, she didn't know if he was in Manhattan or not, he was. I think we might all have that 6 degrees of separation from someone that was there. I have a distant cousin I never met that was in Tower 2 and broke his leg escaping. He was originally from Stoney Creek moved to NYC and did all the morning shows in Ontario some weeks latter. No way to get notoriety.  Prayers still go out to those souls that died and those still dying of complications from being exposed to all those cancer causing building materials as well as the trauma of those that survived as well as those that mourn loved ones lost that dreadful day in our history.  Where were you? Can history repeat itself?  "

They volunteered at zero wages. Hindsight is 20/20, the thousands of tons of drywall dust which is laden with Silica has and still is taking the lives of individuals that were part of the recovery and clean up. As well we remember the images of those covered in an inch of drywall and concrete dust running from and for the Cops and Firefighters running into ground zero. Those are the real heroes of our society including every volunteer from the Red Cross to our Ironworker, not ball players making 20 million a year or the celebrities that do nothing other than pretend they are someone else. I remember then seeing workers with only bandanas wrapped around their mouths for breathing protection and screaming at the TV to get those workers proper protection when my Health and Safety training kicked in. It came but for many too late. If you look at a individual specimen of Silica under a microscope it looks exactly like a miniature Skill Saw blade. Once in the lung it never leaves. As one breaths those saw blades cut into the soft tissue and cause irreparable damage. Silicosis is the disease.  I cringe when I see young and old workers exposed to basic beach sand or stone dust etc. commonly referred to in the industry as ""Free Airborne Silica"" without the proper basic protective equipment. Don't get me going when I see babies playing in a sand box, same stuff if you stop and think about it really."
