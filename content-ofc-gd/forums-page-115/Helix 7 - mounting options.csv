980879,Jds63,2016-09-01 13:21:00,1365,After many years of using the portable HBird 535 I upgraded to the Helix 7.  Does anyone have suggestions on a removable mounting system ?  I would prefer to not have to drill into my boat for a mounting system so I was looking at some of the Scottys mounting hardware. My boat is a 14 ft Princecraft  Yukon.

980884,Jds63,2016-09-01 14:35:00,1365,Thanks I found the Ram mounts online ... do you drill holes into the gunnel with this setup ? 
980885,grimsbylander,2016-09-01 14:51:00,3016,Google the RAM double suction mount...  RAM-B-189B-FRO1U-RAM  Might work for you and no drilling.

980895,Jds63,2016-09-01 19:33:00,1365,Thanks all ... I see there are a few options ?

980912,porkpie,2016-09-01 22:46:00,2521,Ram mount all day.  That's a pretty sizeable unit.  I run a 7 inch screen on the medium size ram ball setup and its very solid.

Thanks (sorry) You may have trouble if you are looking at it with polarized glasses.  I found that trying to look at a console unit by peering over my shoulder from the bow seat would cause the screen to look black when I had polarized glasses.  IF you turned around and looked straight at it, it would be fine.  Mine was an older BottomLine unit.  I am not sure if the issue affects all screens.   But if the screen and your glasses are both polarized, it will probably have that issue.  I would think that both the Scotty and Ram mounts can be flipped 180 deg.  The Scotty unit can be set in 12 positions in 30 deg increments.  The Ram may be able to give continuous rotation.  "
980936,wormdunker,2016-09-02 12:55:00,1711,I have the ram mount on my 14' Lund with a Humminbird 798.  Solid as a rock & versatile for moving to different positions.
980940,fishindevil,2016-09-02 18:11:00,6254,I have my HELIX 9 DI mounted on a 6 inch RAM mount in my Lund and I can see it from the front of my boat as it will almost swivel around and the larger ram ball mount it does not move at all and trust me the helix 9 is fairly heavy and no issues just drill a few holes mount it and you are good ..... Advice is get the largest ram mount you can get away with as the 6 inch mount had me almost looking face to face with it as opposed to looking down at it ???
980955,Jds63,2016-09-03 03:41:00,1365,Did you drill holes in the gunnels ?
