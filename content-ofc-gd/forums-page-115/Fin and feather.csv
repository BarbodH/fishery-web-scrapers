981121,NAW,2016-09-07 14:17:00,4022,Nice Shooting Dara!!  As if I wasn't already  pumped up enough for goose opener down here!!  I have a feeling it will be slow this year.  The farmers where I hunt aren't seeing many birds this year.  They thinks it's because of the heat.  But I'm not sure.
981134,misfish,2016-09-07 20:16:00,29133,"Hey Nick. I seen a real nice flock Sunday near cold water. Talking to a guy that hunts up there alot ,was saying the farmers are turning thier fields already. I have noticed though here in the bay, the duck population is growing real fast. I am down there at dark in the mornings and just sit there listening to them quacking away. Gets the old hunting blood going. Yes I know Im just teasing myself as I wont be shooting any.LOL"
981135,Joey,2016-09-07 20:41:00,9122,"Nice, good job"
981180,Dara,2016-09-08 13:56:00,3052,"It was just too hot to keep the shoes on in the boat, even the hunting was pretty warm, but that's early season. Next weekend chickens will be open. Hopefully it cools off a bit this year"
