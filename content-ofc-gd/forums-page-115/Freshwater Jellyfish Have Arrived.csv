981074,Oggie,2016-09-06 17:22:00,588,Out fishing this morning I realized I was looking at thousands of submerged blobs.  After looking closely I realized they were jellyfish .....thousands of jellyfish.  My camp is on a small (2Km by 1Km) spring fed lake with no inflows.  I guess these invaders arrived on a boat hull from the public launch.  After a quick google I realized they're in lots of Ontario lakes.  Anyone noticed a difference in their lake after these invaders appeared?  
981085,captpierre,2016-09-06 19:34:00,2521,First I've heard of them.
981089,manitoubass2,2016-09-06 19:57:00,11391,I just posted about this two weeks ago  Im in northwestern ontario and many lakes near me are on the list.  Ive noticed zero difference fishing these lakes.
981098,captpierre,2016-09-06 22:34:00,2521,Googled them. Likely invasive species from China. Harmless to people. Barbs apparently can't penetrate human skin. May be increasing due to global warming.

981105,CaseyB,2016-09-06 23:12:00,6,Found them in Haliburton this weekend. First time I've seen them.

981108,GBW,2016-09-07 00:15:00,8460,Found them in Haliburton this weekend. First time I've seen them. Seen them there years ago fishing a club event.  All the size of a dime to nickle
981115,fishindevil,2016-09-07 08:49:00,6254,Several lakes I fish in Haliburton have them .... Usually see them about this time of year as well I did see some a few weeks ago but last weekend there were many ..... They are about the size of a dime pretty cool to see them moving in the lake for sure but the MNR are not too concerned about them there is a list somewhere which shows what lakes they have been confirmed in and there is more than I thought in Haliburton .... Seems like they are spreading as well
981117,lastcall,2016-09-07 09:27:00,33,"Yup, I'm on a 5 chain lake in Haliburton and all 5 have them."
981124,Oggie,2016-09-07 16:13:00,588,Well it turns out these things are becoming increasingly common in Eastern Ontario. I'm up by Mattawa.  Hard to believe a jellyfish from China made it here.  Guess we really do need to start taking this boat washing thing seriously. 
981126,PUMP KNOWS,2016-09-07 16:43:00,937,Interesting... I had to google image and youtube it
981128,GBW,2016-09-07 17:05:00,8460,Guess we really do need to start taking this boat washing thing seriously.  Yes we DO!!
