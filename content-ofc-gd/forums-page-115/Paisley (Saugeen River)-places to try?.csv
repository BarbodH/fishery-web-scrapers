Looking to target bass and pike action in the two evenings available to me..any suggestions of places to try and good tactics for that river etc please fire me a PM..thanks  From the maps I looked at, where the North meets the main river, looks to be a likely spot for some action, not sure how wide or deep the river is around there, it don't take much to float the sportspal tho"
