980953,porkpie,2016-09-03 02:19:00,2521,"You have a shot at salmon if you target 20-40 foot of water.  There's already small numbers of fish in some tributaries and the cooler nights will push fish into the harbour mouths.  You could probably do ok very shallow at first light.  There are tons of fish staging in 60fow at the moment off of other tribs.  Try trolling some deep diving cranks, and have fun."
