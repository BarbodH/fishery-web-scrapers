Lost between me and my buddy were 7 glow in the dark spoons and a full reel of line not such a good night but thats how it goes sometimes. Still had a good time with lots of laughs.

981348,Rizzo,2016-09-11 22:18:00,4754,how did you lose 7 spoons?
981362,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-12 05:56:00,8243,"I wonder how much tackle is on the bottom of those urban piers? If 2 guys lose 7 spoons and a few hundred yards of line in a few hours multiply that by a few thousand. How does that happen FH?  A bad day or night fishing is better than many things more productive, like being at work. Good on you guys for toughing it out and enjoying it. Even after loosing close to a 100 bucks worth of tackle."

I do recall a bail closing accidently mid cast and 2/5 ounce Cleo sailing into the wild blue yonder. Rotten line could have been the culprit, hence the lost line."
981385,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-12 18:51:00,8243,"Yea Dave if I lose 1 plug per year that's about it, usually a cast that wraps the tip and snap goes the plug."
