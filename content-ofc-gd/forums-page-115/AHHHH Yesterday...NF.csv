He was a Kiwi here on a a vacation back in the mid to late 80""s just looking to connect with anyone, so he does what any logical person would do, go to High School. Man the pictures he produced has me both cringing & laughing, many MANY will not see the light of day here due to.........whatever, but man what a AWESOME blast it was chatting with a brother from a different mother, feel I'm becoming abit of a old folk......GASP!!!!! Gotta say we were a very multi cultural group of misfits, & without diving into what would now be considered non-PC we existed without malice  even though we jabbed one a other daily, it was the punk thing to do.  Playing Cricket in the hallway, cigarettes lit..damn the teachers    Hanging at the coffee shop skipping school, the bearded one was 6 years old scoring us beer....we were 7 or so....love this shot!!!!    Not the normal day when this would happen outside ( it was a inside daily occurrence)  , fire drills were a conman thing, good thing there was a teach to stop it right there.......!!!!    LOLOLOLOLOL me & my Buddy Holly glasses...........I laugh because no matter what I did the police would not convict/retain me........ every one else...!!!!!!!!!    Not sure how he ended up with this picture but am glad he did, me & my Da,  late 80's ish    One of MANY journeys out to Nova Scotia (early 90's) just tore Halifax apart never mind Sydney, F%^K YA!!!!, The Mexico pictures are not appropriate for here!!!!LOL !!!! So many stories that can't be told........................longing for my youth (kind of) !!!!!!  "
