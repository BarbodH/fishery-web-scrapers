LOL Back in the 70s all our batteries, we had in stock were left dry; until they were sold. We had a keg of acid in the stock room where we'd fill the batteries and then put them on slow charge for at least 4 or 5 hours before the customer got their car back.  Dan. No not really..........but you are correct about many batteries being shipped dry and even today that is true at some places. However, it has nothing to do with the battery case material."
981573,Garnet,2016-09-15 18:44:00,2056,I re read your post and you should clean those battery post and make sure your charger clips are clean.  Dirty oxide post means less and less charge over time until you think battery is toast.  Get a wire brush from $1 store.

The first lead-acid batteries consisted of glass cells that were enclosed in tar-lined wooden boxes. A damp concrete floor could cause the wood to swell, breaking the glass inside. The Edison cell (i.e. the nickel-iron battery) that preceded the rubber-cased battery was encased in steel. Those that weren't isolated in crates would discharge into concrete quite easily. Later battery cases used primitive hardened rubber, which was somewhat porous and could contain lots of carbon. A moist concrete floor combined with the carbon in the battery cases could create electrical current between the cells, discharging them.  Art"

My on the job training in the Mills since 11th grade on weekends and summers gave me a leg up on all the Engineers graduating into supervisory positions after I transferred to operations, where the $$ was. I finally got my Metallurgical Degree after 10 years of night and some day classes at our local University. By then I had a few engineers working for me. It didn't give me an advantage then but did after I took a ridiculously very early pension at 45 and went on and worked as a Ministry of Labour inspector for the province of Ontario for 8 years.

981610,Canuck,2016-09-16 10:43:00,491,"You need to make sure your charger has a desulphate feature to get the most life from deep cycles.  Some of the new charger maintainers have that, but they are not designed for large capacity batteries.  If you do some research, you will read that large deep cycles need high amperage bulk loading charging with a charger that is at least 10% of the amp hour capacity (or something like that).  So a high capacity battery will not last if you charge it with a small trickle charger.  It will need maybe 30 amps.  Plus the new chargers have a condition mode that you run periodically to break up the crystals that settle to the bottom.  It uses high amp/voltage and basically boils the battery for a short period, then drops off to a trickle mode again.Another less helpful alternative if you have an older but high amp automatic charger is to use a Battery Life Save or similar pulse unit.  You can read up on them.   It basically constantly pulses into the battery that continuously desulphate said.  They add that circuitry to the new small maintainers to help make batteries last while in storage.   They prevent desulphation or slow it, not fix it.  And they are not as effective on large capita batteries unless you get the really large maintainers.  This is an area where if you go too small, you pay the price in cost of new batteries over the long run.I bought one of these to use on my golf cart battery bank on my bigger boat because it had an old charger without desulphate mode.   It worked well until I replaced the charger with a higher capacity new one.   It's now not in use.  I should sell it.https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Life-Saver-BLS-12-24BW/dp/B006X24P50"
981490,rhymobot,2016-09-14 13:58:00,174,"Hi.  I have a Motomaster Nautilius battery. They don't have the same model on CT's website anymore so I can't show you exactly which one I have. I seem to recall it being about $220 four years ago.  Anyway, I use it with a 32lb trolling motor on my 11 foot inflatable. And this is the fourth year using it and I go usually about 30 to 35 times a year for a few hours.  When I'm on the small lakes I almost never run out of juice even though I am hopping from one spot to another.  However, trolling is the problem. Many times I go up and down a river after work for a couple hours. And I troll on 4 or 5 speed. I'd guess after about 1:15 of actual trolling I can tell the battery is losing power gradually. And probably within 20 minutes of noticing, it pretty much slows me right down to the point of me going so slow that it feels like I'm trolling on 2 speed even though I have it on 5.  The first couple summers I had it I could troll on the river for at least twice as long.  This is the charger I use. Nautilus charger. I let it charge on ""optimal"" for 6 to 8 hours. And a handful of times I rapidly charged it because I went for a morning session on lake then needed the battery ready for an afternoon session.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/motomaster-nautilus-battery-charger-15-10-2a-0111525p.html#srp  I also kept my battery in the basement in the winter and would charge it to full once a month between Nov. and May.  Is my battery simply reaching the end of it's life cycle? Maybe I didn't maintain it as well as I could have.  But is there a simple way of reviving it by adding some kind of water? The battery itself is in good shape on the outside. Looks pretty clean. And I think it's a sealed battery.  By the way, I'm not exactly a handy person. But if there's an easy enough way of doing this I'll give it a try. Or maybe I'll just have to suck it up and buy a new one.  Thanks for the advice."
981492,John Bacon,2016-09-14 14:11:00,3277,"If it is a seal battery then there probably isn't much you can do.  If it was not sealed, and the water levels were low, then topping it up with distilled water would help.It sounds like the battery is reaching the end of it's life.I have had better luck with batteries from Walmart or Costco than I have had with the ones from Canadian Tire.  But, completely draining a battery each time you use it will wear the battery down quickly.  Your winter maintenance sounds fine.  You may need to replace your batteries more often than someone who only uses them to position the boat."
981493,Korber,2016-09-14 14:18:00,79,"I have a good auto-off battery charger/ maintainer, I use this on my NAPA battery. Seems to do me well. pushes my 14' Tinny with 2-4 people in it well. We troll with it and spot hop on smallers lakes. Usually i charge it after every night but sometimes I go two days without charging it but at the end of the second trip on the second day its dead.  Your Battery could be at the end of its life, I don't think there is anything that you could do, but there maybe a specialized battery shop that could help you save it but it might be more money than a new battery is worth.  I would also suggest getting a smaller solar panel (5W)They are great if you can make a mount for the boat. helps top off the battery while your out. they are top notch to keep the battery moving when you are out for the weekend fishing but that is more so a fun tool then a required one."
981494,NANUK,2016-09-14 14:46:00,797,"If you have been using the battery right down to nothing on most days, I would say 4 years is pretty good you got out of it, There are only so many life cycles you get out of a battery, a battery charged after 50% use will last much longer than one charged after 80% use. There isn't much you can do to revive it back."
981495,Garnet,2016-09-14 14:51:00,2056,You need to load test the battery. CT or any shop has a load tester.

The more you spend the more charges from dead you have. Never let them die and they will last 10 years, I had one that went 10 years.  I leave them on a maintenance trickle charge all winter, switching from each one every few weeks.  Looks like you are in the market for a new battery and the new one should last you twice as long. Check the manufacture date on the thing before you buy one. Some are 2 years old when they sell you a new battery."
981521,aplumma,2016-09-14 20:20:00,6896," This is a cut and paste from a website on batteries    Why Lead-Acid Batteries Stop Working  All rechargeable batteries work by producing chemical reactions, and each new charge and discharge makes minute permanent changes to the battery’s chemical structure. In lead-acid batteries, the most popular choice for vehicles and industrial situations, the breakdown occurs because of a chemical reaction between the lead and the sulfuric acid in the battery. The two substances form a third substance called lead sulfite, and as the battery gets older, the lead sulfite starts to form crystals inside the battery. Because the battery is no longer able to use the lead and sulfuric acid in the crystals, the battery’s functionality goes down until the crystals get big enough to render the battery entirely useless.
