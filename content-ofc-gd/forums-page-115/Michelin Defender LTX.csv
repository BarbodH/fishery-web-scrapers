980934,ecmilley,2016-09-02 11:47:00,2163,Lew seen if that price includes an alignment checknor a half price alignment. When at active green and ross we would quite often do the align for half price when someone purchased 4 tires felt that strongly about it. Why gamble  a 1200  rubber
980935,lew,2016-09-02 11:56:00,12766,"Yes, I'm definitely getting the alignment checked Ernie, something I always do when putting on new tires."

980957,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-03 06:14:00,8243,"I put on 4 Cooper Discoveries on my 1/2 ton Silverado last winter. An aggressive all season that look like winters. I love them all seasons now. I know you have made a choice but for those looking a great tire for a 1/2 ton 4X4 and no need to change to summers I highly recommend them. Worked all winter and quiet in the summer. I see no significant change in summer or winter mileage compared with the factory supplied all seasons. I think they were Good Year that went 80K. Much, much better on ice and snow by far."
980963,misfish,2016-09-03 16:17:00,29133,Had them on my F150 . Great tire. Looking around for pricing for the Ram now.
980964,lew,2016-09-03 16:22:00,12766,"For anyone interested, I had these tires installed early this morning and after driving only about 25 miles I felt I'd made the right decision in going with the Michelin Defenders. Very smooth and quiet ride  at 60 MPH and I think I'll be happy with them.  Timing couldn't have been better either as I found a 1 x 1 1/2 inch tear in the sidewall of one of the old tires. I'm always real fussy with my tires and check them frequently but this tear was on the side facing under the truck and I never noticed it before.  Gonna probably be driving about 3000 miles in the next few weeks so I'm sure glad I didn't have those tires on....whew !!!!  "

980996,Old Ironmaker,2016-09-04 19:37:00,8243,"This past spring I shopped for new tires for my 2011 1/2 ton Silverado at 80,000 KM. I wanted something aggressive without road noise and good value. I shopped hard for a few weeks. I settled on Cooper Discoverer AT/3. All 4 installed and balanced for $800.00 at Caledonia Tire. So far so good. They are not winter rated but I will have no problems with the aggressive tread on them other than catching the odd stone in the tread. I am surprised that there is virtually no humming at high speeds. I highly recommend them.  edit: I bought them even though I hate the 1/2 hour Cooper Tire commercial called "" Fishin' Canada""."
980813,lew,2016-08-31 16:32:00,12766,"I'm putting new 20"" tires on my '13 F-150 and have read some good stuff about the Michelin Defender LTX.  Just wondering if anyones using them and what are your opinions...good or bad.  I use dedicated winter tires so these will only be 3 seasons."
980814,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-31 16:46:00,627,I have been running Michelin tires on my vehicles since the early 90's Lew. Both my wife's cars and my trucks. Perhaps not the Defenders but LT's for sure on the trucks. Winter dedicated snow tires are Michelin's as well. I have always been happy with the ride and handling.
980815,lew,2016-08-31 16:57:00,12766,"Thanks Tom, I've had Michelins on a few other vehicles but not for 10 years or so now and was always happy with them. Evidentely the Defenders are a new model but I'm sure they'll meet the standard of Michelin.  I can get a set  of 4 installed, balanced, taxes and road hazard warranty for $1193 out the door at Kal Tire in P'Boro.  Heck of a good price in my opinion"
980816,Dara,2016-08-31 17:47:00,3052,"If I put new tires on mine (same truck) I'm getting 18"" rims...I don't like the 20's, too rough. And I have them Perrellis on now...never again"
980817,DanD,2016-08-31 17:48:00,2223,"What's the size Lew, not just the rim size; I would like to see where my shop stands with your supplier?  Dan."
980818,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-31 18:01:00,627,"for 20"" tires Lew, that's a great deal. I have purchased tires at Kal Tire in the past and they have always switched my winter to summer and summer to winter free of charge. (so long as the tires were purchased there)  They will even store them for you as well, which I have never taken advantage of.  Although with your empty garage, storage should NOT be a problem."
980820,lew,2016-08-31 18:19:00,12766,"What's the size Lew, not just the rim size; I would like to see where my shop stands with your supplier?  Dan.  Dan, the Pirelli's I have now are P275 / 55 / R20 111s  Dara, I like the 20's and don't find them too bad, but your right, my winter tires are 17 and they for sure are a bit smoother with the higher sidewall.  Tom, yeah I shopped around and Kal Tire was cheaper than the other lowest price and $400 cheaper than the FORD dealer...which wasn't unexpected.  I also like to deal with a company that specializes in tires unlike CTC or Costco.  I always change my own tires plus my daughters for the winter and your right, I have plenty of space to store them as I have an upstairs loft in the garage and all 8 tires fit comfortably under the stairs completely out of the way."
980822,DanD,2016-08-31 18:31:00,2223,"That is a good deal, I come in at about 60 buck less but no road hazard. I'll have to talk to my supplier! LOL Good shopping Lew!  Dan."
980824,lew,2016-08-31 18:42:00,12766,"Thanks Dan, IMO that road hazard is a big plus.  Kal Tire up here has a very good rep and I think they'll be good guys to deal with.  Gonna call them right now and get them ordered as the Mrs. and I are heading for Nova Scotia & PEI in 2 weeks and  I want them on for the trip."
980830,Tom McCutcheon,2016-08-31 19:28:00,627,"A little bit off topic, but worth mentioning. For those who change their tires up every fall and spring. don't forget to RE TORQUE the nuts after 100 or so kms. I neglected to do this and found my left rear wheel making lots of noise and just about to come off. 3 lug nuts sheared off and 3 more loose. Ruined the aluminum wheel and needed six new studs and nuts."
980844,ecmilley,2016-08-31 23:47:00,2163,Michelins be good lew almost put them on my truck but decided to go with goodyear duratracs for the off roading i do
980845,ketchenany,2016-09-01 00:02:00,3229,Lew I put Michelins (first time) on my Jeep two winters ago and they are amazing in the snow. I just nota new 2016 and I can still use them  I only put on 7 to 8 km per season so they are still new. On this Jeep I have 4x4 and a snow option hope that will make them even better.
980847,Fisherman,2016-09-01 00:43:00,7201,"Lew, don't know if you have a Costco nearby, they may be a few dollars cheaper and they have the lifetime rotation and repairs included.  I just had a bad dealing with Goodyear, anything other than manufacture defect, they are not warrantied without buying an extra plan.  I've had Michelin on all my other trucks, I'll be junking the goodyears next spring. I believe the new Defenders are an upgrade to the LTX MS/2 series."
980849,SBCregal,2016-09-01 01:01:00,688,I was looking at these as well to replace the tires on my truck.  I had the ltx ms2 on my old safari van and they are probably the nicest tires I've driven on.  Let us know how you like them.  Ryan
980850,captpierre,2016-09-01 02:11:00,2521,Scary Thanks.
980859,lew,2016-09-01 11:44:00,12766,"Lew, don't know if you have a Costco nearby, they may be a few dollars cheaper  I called the tire center at COSTCO in Peterboro 4 times yesterday and couldn't get anyone to answer a phone so to heck with them, I'll give my business to KalTire who answered the phone on the 1st ring and  gave me a quote within 1 minute. They ordered my tires yesterday and hope to have them in tomorrow and if so will do the install on Saturday.  That's the kind of folks I like to deal with."

Ruined the aluminum wheel and needed six new studs and nuts.  Just to add to this, make sure the mating surfaces of the wheel and the hub are 100% clean; especially on aluminum wheels. Wire brush or sandpaper it right down to bare metal; a coat of paint if you like but it must be clean and smooth.  Dan"

980866,DanD,2016-09-01 12:24:00,2223,"X2 or they will stick worse than gorilla glue.  I'm not so worried about them sticking; it's the corrosion breaking away after the wheel is bolted back on, allowing the wheel to become loose.  Dan."
980868,lew,2016-09-01 12:35:00,12766,I swap my tires back & forth twice a year and have always wire brushed them but a couple years back I started using anti-sieze also and it works very well. Never had a wheel stuck on a hub before but now it's even better.

Thanks Dan, and Lew for the Anti seize idea."
980893,Headhunter,2016-09-01 17:50:00,5703,"A little off topic, but I thought I'd pass along a recent tire/rim experience I had with my Ford Flex. i had my shop do a tire rotation and afterwards, the truck was shaking badly at highway speed. Shop thought the balance may be out so they checked all four tires. Well, it appears that I had a bent rim. Here's where the head shaking begins! Ford wants $1,200 all in for a new rim! My gut hurt from laughing at that price!!!! Called a few wreckers and sourced a used rim out of Quebec... $330 all in. HH"
980896,Tom McCutcheon,2016-09-01 19:43:00,627,"Yep, new rim for mine from Ford was $1100.00. Got one from a wrecker that almost new condition for $300."
980897,John,2016-09-01 19:57:00,2956,"Hi Lew. Greetings from PEI.  Defender LTX is a good tire. My price all in installed, balanced, taxes included, including road hazard, no charge seasonal changeover and 24/7/365 North America wide tire roadside assistance is $1120.00. So your Kal Tire price is OK. Forget Costco, they are a pain in the rear to deal with and Defender to Defender their tires are not exactly the same. On some models they buy a specific tread design exclusive to them. I am not a fan.  John"
980909,lew,2016-09-01 22:33:00,12766,"Thanks John, I was hoping you'd chime in with your price.  I guess KalTire may not be the cheapest but I'm happy with $1193, specially compared to the other places I talked to.  We've been following your trip on Facebook and it sounds like you & Barb are having a great time and hopefully the trailer is everything you hoped for. We'll be leaving on the 12th so maybe we'll pass on the hi-way somewhere LOL"
