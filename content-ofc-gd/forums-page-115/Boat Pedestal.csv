I find the $200+ adjustables break and the seals give out  Only problem is they seam to jump from 13-15"" then the next size is 24-25""  I want something between 18-20""  Are there any out there? Is there a way to cut down a 25""?"

I have a virtually brand new adjustable bass seat that goes to 31"" I believe and a single standard seat post that came with the Lund Boats...  Mike, I know the amount of fishing you do, and the boat you have.....  Those wedge seat post mounts are horrible.....but if you can use either posts I have, let me know."
