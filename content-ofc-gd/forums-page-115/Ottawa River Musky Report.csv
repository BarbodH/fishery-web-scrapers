And it's shallow dirty water which is the opposite of the st Lawrence River  I hate it because I've fished this River 5-6 times over 4-5 years and never put a fish in the boat despite finding fish and getting follows every trip... Even got a few bites but didn't hook up  Today I had a score to settle and needed to break my Ottawa River curse  Hit the River at 7am and first spot we move a fish in the mid 40's but it didn't commit... Good start  Later we missed one on a nice weed point but again couldn't get the it hooked up  Then we had a fish close to 50"" follow hot but my partner didn't see her early enough and missed a good boat side opportunity  We hit a few other spots then decided to go back on that big fish as it was on the way home anyways  We pulled in and I put on a nice glider and 3-4 casts into the spot I get hit... FINALLY BROKE THE SKUNK CURSE.... I yelled fish on... Get the net it's coming right at us...   PIKE!!!!!  Never been so disappointed to catch a fish in my life...  Ottawa River wins again...  I will have my day... Someday"

As we all know, the first is always the toughest, but all signs are pointing to landing one next time. I remember the first propwash fish I caught...stinky jack...huge excitement followed by huge disappointment. So ticked I nearly ate that pike...until I remembered I don't like fish much and it got to swim away"
