66708,lew,2007-05-01 21:55:00,12767,"I phoned Cabelas last Thursday night and ordered a GPS unit, and was told delivery would take between 3 - 7 business days to arrive here in Toronto.  I received it today.........3 business days.  No wonder some companies flourish !!"
66710,Roy,2007-05-01 22:04:00,13728,I have never bought anything from them but I keep hearing good things about their service. This is just another confirmation. Glad they (and you) did good.
66718,Dondorfish,2007-05-01 22:14:00,1000,3 days eh Lew - Hmmm - slowing down   LOL  Always top notch service in my books  Don
66720,solopaddler,2007-05-01 22:22:00,8605,"I'm not surprised. For the last 10 years or so I've probably averaged 5-6 orders a year with them, and never once have they let me down. Shipping is always fast, prices are good, selection is the best, and return policy is second to none."
66725,Terry,2007-05-01 22:31:00,14456,and the price the quote you is the price you pay..it is a great place to buy from
66730,Heybud_e,2007-05-01 22:45:00,208,"just got my new rod from Cabelas in the mail yesterday, quick shipping, very happy customer! .. Bud"

66772,carll2,2007-05-02 00:21:00,443,"i order from them quite often   all i have to say is number 1 service, and its weird sometimes i get charged duty and other times i dont get charged ...weird.."
66788,mistyjr1,2007-05-02 00:41:00,97,"Yea Lew, Dad, Ben and I like Cabelas.... Just not the bill  "
66798,PatrickGG,2007-05-02 00:47:00,562,"Cabelas has a good reputation when it comes to getting your purchased items on time, I recently ordered a few things and got them in 4 business days."
66806,Whopper,2007-05-02 00:55:00,2174,Place an order online last Weds for some baits for an upcoming trip   and they were sitting on my dinning room table when I got home from work Friday. I was impressed!  Whopper

66828,GbayGiant,2007-05-02 01:17:00,1780," If the products are manufactured in the US there is no duty, if they are made in China or any other country they will hit you for the duty fee."
66829,solopaddler,2007-05-02 01:17:00,8605," Made in North America, no duty is paid, made elsewhere, you do."
66838,danc,2007-05-02 01:28:00,4677,"I've been ordering from Cabelas since the 70's. I've never had a bad experience yet. Even if something goes wrong, they fix it and fast."
66847,Dano,2007-05-02 01:52:00,719,"Yea, Cabelas rocks for sure I've got tons of stuff from them, never a problem yet."
66922,ricoboxing,2007-05-02 11:14:00,398, how can you find out where it was made?
66931,lew,2007-05-02 11:40:00,12767, Cabelas customer service could probably help you out with that  1-800-237-4444
66955,rickster,2007-05-02 12:33:00,495,The business I work for became an international dealer for Cabelas last year.  I have looked after the ordering for our customers and the sales have been great and the service from Cabelas is super.
67040,RangerGuy,2007-05-02 15:45:00,564,Yup I would have been much happier if we got Cabelas instead of BPS. Cabelas is much better store.  Always great service and lots of stock
67051,Terry,2007-05-02 16:27:00,14456,"well I like both stores the only problem with BPS online ordering is they ship UPS and UPS screws you with broker fees everytime I am sure BPS has lost millions in Canada cataloge sales after going with UPS, pity"
67075,SlowPoke,2007-05-02 17:51:00,2984,We normally order pizza for take-out...
