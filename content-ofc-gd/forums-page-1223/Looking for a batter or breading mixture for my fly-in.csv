67105,ssauvain,2007-05-02 19:22:00,77,Wanted some ideas on an easy batter or breading for my fly-in trip. We have a fish cooker at the cabin. Two of the boring old farts need something non-spicey...appreciate any ideas.
67108,Smokey,2007-05-02 19:26:00,1278,"Fish Crisp. In regular, italian or roasted butter. All taste great and come in small packages. Its all the guys watn on my fly-in. If you can get to BPS the Uncle Bucks is also great tasting.  Good Luck"
67118,Harv,2007-05-02 19:49:00,19,All I ever use is Italian bread crumbs.  I dip the filets in milk (or water) and then into the bread crumbs.  It makes a nice dry batter that fries up nice and golden.  When the fillets come out of the grease I spice them up accordingly.  I love the Lemon and Herb Clubhouse spice as well as the Cajun.  Have a great trip.  HARV
67127,solopaddler,2007-05-02 20:11:00,8605,"I also like the Italian seasoned bread crumbs as well. What's also really good is a 50/50 mix of Italian bread crumbs and grated Romano cheese (the kind in a can you sprinkle on pasta). Dip the fish in milk like Harv mentioned, coat them in the mixture, then saute in 2/3 extra virgin olive oil, 1/3 salted butter. Squeeze a bit of fresh lemon on before you eat, and let me tell ya, it's amazing!"

67129,douG,2007-05-02 20:13:00,2693,"Jeeze, I shouldn't read threads like this right before dinner.  It's tough typing in a puddle of drool."
67157,Gerritt,2007-05-02 21:41:00,6129,or check here (OFC has everything!) http://www.ontariofishing.net/fish-recipes/  Might I recommend mine? just mix all the dry stuff together in a large bowl stick it in a ziplock bag till your ready to use it   Gerritt.
67160,Smokey,2007-05-02 21:48:00,1278,Gerritts works as well I tryed it this winter. Really Crisp batter style.
67161,grt1,2007-05-02 21:49:00,638,"if you want simplicity, get the Rocky Madsen batter mix that features labatts blue. the directions tell you to add  the contents of the package to a bottle of Blue minus 2 sips (you gotta love it when you get to test one of the ingredients ). This makes as good of a beer batter as any I've tried and it beats the daylights out of adding beer to pancake batter mix."
67162,bigbuck,2007-05-02 21:50:00,2449,"Soak the fillets in beer, then dip them in pancake mix batter made with beer. It's awesome!!! The beer helps the batter not soak up too much oil so they are nice and crispy and damned good!!"
67184,niplodge,2007-05-02 22:36:00,7,"Try Aunt Jemima original just add water pancake mix, but insted of water I put ahalf a can of beer in a bowl and add the mix untill the batter is fairly runny. Ontop of the batter I shake seasoning salt mix well.the fillets are first tossed in flour and next into the batter, then into the oil.Delicious beer batterd fish. Most importent, make sure the other half of beer is put to good use.Enjoy."

67196,Greencoachdog,2007-05-02 23:22:00,8163,"All purpose flour in a gallon size zip-loc bag with garlic salt and pepper to taste, throw fillets or whole fish in and shake... deep fry until done... enjoy!"

67232,Zib,2007-05-03 01:26:00,369,Walleye is pretty good dipped in milk & then into some pancake mix. Good stuff.
