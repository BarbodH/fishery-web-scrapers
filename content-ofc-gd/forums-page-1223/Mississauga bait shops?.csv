67272,urbanangler1990,2007-05-03 02:47:00,933,"ok thnx mjl, now which is closer, lol from 401 west?"
67275,FishFinder,2007-05-03 02:54:00,481,"i wouldnt trust lebarons because they dont always have roe, go to angling specialties. I would rather buy jigs or worms if i was you as their pretty turned off by roe because of all the pressure. "
67276,MJL,2007-05-03 02:55:00,2427,"Looking at Google maps, they're only 10min away from each other.  With that said, AngSpec is closer to the Credit if that's where you're going  You can Google map Angling Specialties: L5B 3X9  Or LeBaron 1590 dundas street east, mississauga, Ontario"
