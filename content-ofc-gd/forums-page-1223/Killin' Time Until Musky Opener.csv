Sure there are other species to fish for, but nothing quite fills the musky void.  The angler formerly known as Reefhawg and I will probably be heading out for some walleye the next couple of weekends and then we're making the long trek up to Red Lake for the second last week of May. Hopefully we'll get into some fat pike up there to tide us over until opener."

Pike opener is so close, I can almost taste it.  It doesn't taste very good by the way, but I'm still looking forward to both esox openers."

67030,Smokey,2007-05-02 15:12:00,1278,Hey we missed the opener on Rice this year. I was teaching a course so never bothered contacting anyone for lunch. I'm thinking though the boat will hit the water today and see if I can dig up a few fish.
67055,speedtroll,2007-05-02 16:57:00,52,Hey Sandy  Is Adam still alive? I missed you guys at the Odyssey. Hope all is well.  RAF  HOLY %$&&.   Nice trout. I see JP has kept you busy. Should be a great Pike opener with the water still so cold. You should hammer them up there. Make sure you guys post some picks.  TTYL  Speed
