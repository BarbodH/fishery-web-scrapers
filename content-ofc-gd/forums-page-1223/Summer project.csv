66776,verno,2007-05-02 00:31:00,178,"My buddy and I have co-owned a boat for several years, and out of convenience we left it at his cottage.  They had a better boat up there so ours was neglected.  Well they sold the cottage so now our boat is in my drive and we will spend the summer cleaning it up.  It's gonna need new carpet and seats and a good powerwashing.  The trailer got new tires and lights for the trip down, but the trailer will have to be stripped and painted at the very least.  Here's the before pics.  I may be asking some questions along the way.   The motor is the biggest concern, we took the cap off and it looks like no water got in there but there were a couple cobwebs."
66785,xrap,2007-05-02 00:40:00,683,Good Luck!!
66796,Rob,2007-05-02 00:45:00,467,ICARAMBA!!!! that's nasty!!
66797,Dondorfish,2007-05-02 00:46:00,1000,This could get very interesting!  Keep us posted on the progress  Don
66814,irishfield,2007-05-02 00:58:00,26272,"Geez guys...it's just mold ! Lotsa soap...elbow work and she'll look like new. Power blast that lower unit...a coat of paint... and worst case if she dies on you, those nice old seats pull out into beds.  Good luck with it Verno. Put a bit of pride into it and a nice set of rod/rigger mount tracks and you'll be good to go. Hopefully the motor was fogged when put away..but doubt that would even matter considering the years of varnish imbedded in the cylinder walls to protect it."
66824,Sinker,2007-05-02 01:13:00,8692,"Well as long as  your not in a rush, it could be a fun  project.  I'll bet that old johnson fires right up!  Sinker"
66825,Smokey,2007-05-02 01:14:00,1278,Man you have your work cut out for you but it will all be worth it in the end.  Hows the bird hunting been going?
66827,KyleM,2007-05-02 01:17:00,218,Nothin like fixing up an old boat.  Iam in the middle of doing a 69 starcraft aluminun falcon.   Looks like a lot of fun to me.
66833,Terry,2007-05-02 01:21:00,14456,well looks like a summer project to me. soap or bleach and rubber gloves
66857,vance,2007-05-02 02:17:00,719,Here is a link to what you have to do to reawaken that motor of yours.  http://forums.iboats.com/showthread.php?t=158086  http://forums.iboats.com/showthread.php?t=167352  Those old 35 were tough motors and I bet it won't take much to purring again.  vance
66945,pikehunter,2007-05-02 12:14:00,1659,"Looks like a fun project. Just watch the wallet and don't spend any cash on items that are not needed.  What condition is the hull in? You mentioned the floor, carpet and seats. But as you probably know the hull is the most important. Those old glass boats can be pretty rotted. The fold out seats can be replaced. There are many internet sites that sell them.  As for the motor. Get it running before spending time prettying it up.  Good luck. I hope to see a photo journal of it soon."
66967,caper,2007-05-02 13:03:00,210,"Good luck on the project Verno, In the meantime your more than welcome in my boat to get out on the water.."
67063,keram,2007-05-02 17:22:00,585,"Good luck with it. Looks like a ""dream"" project for ""garage engineer"""
67230,verno,2007-05-03 01:18:00,178,"Thanks for the input guys, I'm hoping you guys are right and the old Johnson will fire right up. Smokey I havent had a chance to get out for Turkey yet, I'm hoping my next set of days of. Vance, thanks for the links I have saved them, I think they will come in real handy. Pikehunter, the hull looks pretty sound so far, the transom we have gone over very well and there are no soft spots.  Havent been underneath yet. Caper, I may just have to take you up on that offer. Keram, I got the garage cleaned out just the week before, any earlier and the wife would have had it full of junk before the boat got here. A side note on that, I never told her the boat was coming till the day before.  It really is easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission."
67242,pikehunter,2007-05-03 01:43:00,1659," I'll keep my fingers crossed for you Verno,   in hopes that the rest of the hull is also sound."
67245,Sinker,2007-05-03 01:50:00,8692,  You got that right!!          LOL
