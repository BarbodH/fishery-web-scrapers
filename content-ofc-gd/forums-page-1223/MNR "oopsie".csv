66868,fishdawg,2007-05-02 02:39:00,912,"found this on the ""spoonpullers website""  dont think it has been posted here yet  The ministry released 50k Lake Trout of the 11th pier at 3:00 p.m. They were hugging the shoreline well into the night. Needless to say the pier was packed with smelters. There must have been 60 cars parked, 6 generators, and every inch of per taken. The MNR made one trip to the pier at night to check buckets. Later in the night the Township of Oro was controlling traffic and warning everyone not to keep the Trout. Have you ever heard anything so stupid! ""  kind of a similar thing happened localy here this week,     me & my partner were pulling the boat out at the ramp on Sat night & I commented on how many big minnows were in tight,   upon further review theye were freshly stocked rainbows & salmon  those netting bait or smelt in the coming weeks please take caution, as its stocking season"
66902,Greencoachdog,2007-05-02 09:42:00,8163,How do they get those itty bitty fish to wear stockings???
66903,Terry,2007-05-02 09:44:00,14456,"yup I heard about it there are 100s of smelters there every night, so the MNR should have known better"

67059,misfish,2007-05-02 17:16:00,29133,Now thats a real brain fart.  Gues theres no out of the way bay or cove they could of done this at  . This is where cottagers should get involved and offer up there water fronts to launch this sorta thing.  IMO.
67061,Patches,2007-05-02 17:19:00,48,Wonder how many of the 50k were battered and fried that night........
