66667,Daplumma,2007-05-01 20:33:00,1961,Catch a 30+ pound anything and you will have a fight on your hands.I would say that a 30+ lb Muskie would outfight a Carp of the same size.
66746,Photoz,2007-05-01 23:33:00,792,"A muskie of equal size to a big carp will put on an aerobatic show than no carp will ever hope to match . . . . .    but, pound for pound, I'd put my money on the carp for brute strength & pulling power!"
66756,Daplumma,2007-05-01 23:50:00,1961,Keep thinking that... Joe
66862,Rich,2007-05-02 02:22:00,3927,"Ahh no fish fights better than the other, they're all just different. You can say carp are comparable to salmon, but they really aren't. Salmon give it lots of runs but none of the erratic movement that a carp can give. I find channel cats similar to musky when they get above 10lbs but a musky is a heck of a lot more exciting with it's near surface action. Channel cats like to bulldog. It's all great.. just grab a pole and go fishin', there's excitement in anything if you do it right."
66870,wolfville,2007-05-02 02:52:00,396," I totally agree. They are just different. Went panfising this afternoon, caught so many fish I gave up counting. With 2lb line a bigger bluegill put up a hell of fight too. Got a carp on the hook and it was like hooked a train literally, it just went and I could just wait for the line to break.  My point is, fishing is fun, no one single species is more fun than others. If you still think differently, maybe it's because you do not know how to make fishing for other speicies fun. Heck, sometimes I get so excited even when I skunk."
65924,bassmaster4,2007-04-29 23:44:00,801,I like carp as of today. They are crazy good fighters.
65928,Rizzo,2007-04-29 23:49:00,4754,"Geez, tough call, they are all so ugly.  I guess the one that freaks me out the least is the mighty sheephead so I'll have to go with that."
65932,danc,2007-04-29 23:55:00,4677,"I didn't see ""none"" listed in your poll so I didn't vote."
65933,bassmaster4,2007-04-29 23:56:00,801,sorry lol
65936,huntervasili,2007-04-29 23:58:00,1604,"Thats the one i wanted too... add in ""too gross to fish for so I cut the line when I hook one"" to the pole"
65938,bassmaster4,2007-04-30 00:03:00,801,are you kidding theyre great fish not to eat obviously but the fights are good and tehy look nice in pictures because theyre usually pretty big
65939,Beans,2007-04-30 00:04:00,3339,Can't pick just one...never caught a sheepshead but I have caught black drum off the pier at Daytona Fla...same family...  They are all fun to catch
65951,urbanangler1990,2007-04-30 00:33:00,933,"carp , for me, carp are too underated in canada"
65956,bassmaster4,2007-04-30 00:45:00,801,agreed
65969,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-30 01:09:00,2050,"well, I voted sheepshead only because I tipically fish for them while bass fishing....and bass are my favourite sportfish......  I prefer the fight of a carp, but I have to be in the right mood for carp fishing....a lazy mood.... I'm more of a hunter than a sit and wait kind of fisherman...  But in early spring, before the carp and sheepies move in, I have NO problem goin after suckers!  Cheers, UF"
65971,Daplumma,2007-04-30 01:14:00,1961,Catfish are NOT coarse fish! Joe
65973,ccmtcanada,2007-04-30 01:16:00,7971,"I chose carp, even though I have never caught one.  Of all the course fish there are though, carp interests me because of their size and fight.  I'll be targeting them this summer for sure!"
65990,Minnow,2007-04-30 01:53:00,177,"Carp but all are fun to catch! Carp are very underated in north america, Bass is my favorite fish to catch but most but these fish are fun to hook into! I will take the fight of a 30lb carp anyday! These are the fish I grew up fishing and it is what got me hooked and for many shore anglers a great way to get hooked on fishing!"
66002,Rich,2007-04-30 02:29:00,3927, Lemme guess... you complete puzzles in your spare time and listen to Bob Denver? Sheesh!  Keep away from those icky carp!
66024,MJL,2007-04-30 04:10:00,2427, You gotta try your hand at fly fishing for them on shallow flats.  It's the closest thing I can think of to fishing for bonefish or permit down in the tropics.  Stalking them is another technique that's more akin to hunting - break out the camo.  Carp fishing is far more dynamic than most people think.
66028,glirw,2007-04-30 05:24:00,200,They are all great fighters and make for fun days on the water.  The lack of appreciation they get means that there is more left for me and folks like me.
66030,ch312,2007-04-30 05:29:00,1590," bahahaha...owned!  i voted catfish. might be damn ugly, but they taste great.  carp put up one hell of a fight"
66163,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-30 17:42:00,2050," It's funny you mentioned that MJL - I met a guy who was doing just that at the mouth of the creek where I normally carp fish!  He was using some sort of flies and actually hooked into one while I was there...one heck of a fight on fly gear!  I might have to try it someday, but without my dog....whenever I wade out into the water, beyond his reach he howls and barks non-stop until I get back to shore! drives me crazy!  Good Fishin!"
66217,bassjnkie,2007-04-30 19:49:00,1101,"To the people that don't like these fish, especially carp. I have one thing to say, hook in to a 30+Lb sucker mouth, ugly looking, stinky, beady eyed,  freight train, then we'll talk.  JMHO  Anyways I obviously voted carp.  Also vey good poll and topic.  Daniel"
66231,xrap,2007-04-30 20:32:00,683,Voted for catfish. Carp are good fighters but I think a 15lb catfish fights better then a 15lb carp.
66257,misfish,2007-04-30 21:32:00,29133,"Voted ol wisker face.Atleast you can eat,em.LOL"
66312,GbayGiant,2007-05-01 00:05:00,1780,"Voted cats, but only big channel cats if not it would be carp, the average carp is scrappy."
66410,Photoz,2007-05-01 09:16:00,792,"Although I'll take carp over ALL other fish, a good sized sheepshead can give you a good scrap, as can the larger channel cats. I've found the carp in the 12 to 20 pound range put up the best fight, I've caught a few over 30, they make a few half-hearted runs of maybe 50+', and in they come. I've burned my thumb using it for a brake on my spool trying to slow 15 pounders down! But, for $100.00+ you can get a rod, reel, line and some hooks, swivels and egg sinkers, drop by any grocery store and pick up a can of corn, drive to almost ANY larger body of water (or connecting trib) and start catching carp . . .    anywhere from 5 to 40+ pounds! Or you can spend a small fortune on all the lastest carp gizmos . . . . .     and have about the same chance! Whistling salmon I call 'em! (Play it right, ya might even catch a swan!)"
66412,Greencoachdog,2007-05-01 09:36:00,8163,"I voted for Catfish, but I don't really consider them a coarse fish. Some places around here even have creel and length limits for them.  Hey Photoz, what's the creel and size limit for Swans up there???"
66620,Photoz,2007-05-01 18:02:00,792,Not sure if there's a slot size on 'em or not. Definitely way y y y  y   y too big for my roast pan . . . .     but it would likely fit a nice plump bread-fed mallard or black duck!
