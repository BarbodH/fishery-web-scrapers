67085,davew3,2007-05-02 18:28:00,430,I was thinking of waxing my Starcraft which is aluminum with enamel paint and I am wondering if good old Turtle Wax would be good enough or is there a brand out there highly recomended ? Any input would be appreciated.

67097,blaque,2007-05-02 18:56:00,2419,"I use 3M products for the vehicle, they are pretty much the shizzy for detailers and weekend washers alike. Worth the cash. For the boat, i just use Zymol.........goes on and comes off easy as can be and really brings any fade out of my dark blue gelcoat (fiberglass boat). Cleans up real nice with just a wipe with a damp towel after a day on the water. Not sure how well  it would work on enamel paint?"

67133,spanky,2007-05-02 20:24:00,195,"i personally use Zaino or meguirs on my car... Zaino lasting alot longer, not sure how it would work for a boat tho?"
