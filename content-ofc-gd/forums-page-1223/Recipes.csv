Walleye Pizza Take walley fillets and lay them on a pizza pan to form the pizza bottom Top the fillets with your pizza sauce and add your favourite toppings then spread mozza cheese over them and bake until the cheese is melted and browned to your liking.  It may not sound too good but it was the one dish at this corn roast the crowd couldn't get enough of, you had to be quick to get any."

I have tweeked a little bit though  4-5 lbs Northern Pike (or walleye) fillets -- cut into 1"" cubes 1 lb bacon strips, cut in half Italian style dressing Your favourite BBQ sauce Bamboo skewers   Marinate cubed fish in Italian style dressing for 1 hour. Wrap bacon strips around marinated fish cubes. Spear into skewers so bacon doesn't unravel. Repeat until skewers are full. Cook over medium heat on barbecue; turn continually. Brush on your favourite BBQ sauce when the bacon begins to get crisp. Continue turning periodically until fish is white and bacon is crisp.  Caution: Keep a watch on the skewers. The fat from the bacon causes flare-ups  I make a pan out of tin foil and put some olive oil in the bottom before I put the wraps in to eliminate flare ups. Haven't put any BBQ sauce on them yet the first time had them plain and the second time just peppered them with hot sauce, goes well with a ice cold beer  :thumbsup:         Whopper"
