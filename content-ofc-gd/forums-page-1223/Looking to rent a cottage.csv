66771,irishfield,2007-05-02 00:21:00,26272,Father-in-law has a place on main land ...between Penetang and Midland on Georgian Bay...but doubt you wanna pay the $2400/wk that he gets for it all summer long. Also has a place out on Present Island but don't know what it rents for. Probably 1/2 of the above.
