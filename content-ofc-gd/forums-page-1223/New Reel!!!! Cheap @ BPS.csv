I figured what the heck, it's too good a deal, the same reel was $129 a little while back, so, I picked one up. I figure it should be good for bass, pike, bottom bouncing for wally's and when I'm tired of fishing for bait, the odd Kawartha muskie. It seems like a decent reel that will work good with my spare bass casting rod. I'm gonna spool'er up with 50lb PP and go have some fun this summer. There's also some great deals on bass casting reels, there's a $200 Johnny Morris bass reel that's on for $79 and the Citica is also on special as well for I think $119."
