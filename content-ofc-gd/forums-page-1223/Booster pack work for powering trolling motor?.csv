67038,Terry,2007-05-02 15:32:00,14456,depends on amp hours and Reserve Minutes it should say somewhere
67320,hawg_hauler,2007-05-03 11:02:00,69,"I think most boosters nowadays have smart circuitry in them and require a small amount of voltage to turn on, which would require you to still have a battery."
67324,ricksed,2007-05-03 11:22:00,8,Black Blade.I tried a 700 A booster on a 12ft. with a 34lb Minnkota and after 30 min. of stop and go I had to break out the paddle.
67490,Rob,2007-05-03 19:20:00,467,"If you have a variable speed trolling motor, then don't hook it up to the fish finder as well. The surge created from the trolling motor will surge the FF and probably blow the resistor in it. Believe me, I learned the hard way after many resistors  , I isolated the fish finder and no problems since  . Run the FF on its own battery and use a deep cycle battery for your trolling motor.
