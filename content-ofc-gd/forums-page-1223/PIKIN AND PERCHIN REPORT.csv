Finished school last wednsday and since then went out for perch on simcoe twice and out for Pike once......All three days were non stop action ....I love the spring   The first day of perchin was great and we boated over 60 perch and atleast 25 of them were over 11inches ,the biggest being close to 14.  The second day of perchin the action was even better and close to a hundred in three hours and atleast fifty were over 10 inches, we caught a couple that were 13.  Went out yesterday for some pike. It was a beautiful day but a bit windy . The fish were biting thats for sure but i was rusty on the hook set. I went 8 for 14 on mr pike....OUCHHHH. my buddy andrew caught one pike and four huge bass hunting for the toothy criters......In total we boated 9 pike and six huge bass in the process. Dont wurry they were released boatside as they are out of season and on there beds. The biggest pike was 31 inches and we only caught one under twenty eight....not bad Me with a pike about eight pounds  Another one about the same size   It was a great couple days on the water and it will only get better as the water temps climb"

67434,irishfield,2007-05-03 16:44:00,26272,See his double post. Pike is indeed open in Division 16 (Georgian Bay) and I'm sure some others...like Temagami where it's open ALL year.
