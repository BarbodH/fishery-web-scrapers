40506,Fisherman,2007-02-27 03:06:00,7201,"Shipshaw (les Barrages a Arvida) does have some nice fish, everything from perch on up, but do check on the specific requirements for each specie of fish, some you need a daily tag etc, some areas you may need a guide cause you'll be considered a non resident( best I can remember).  See if you can get hold of ""dabluz"" local member from there.  They may still have the two ponds open on the Base( Parc Lambert) Lambert Park for the blokes or tetes carres(flash cube)"

40509,carll2,2007-02-27 03:21:00,443,hey bill parker  get a hold of dabluz. theres alot of oppurtunitys for fishing.  do you speak any french?
40515,huntervasili,2007-02-27 03:38:00,1604,Je Ne parle pas bon Francais... but I do know a couple of bilingual guys who could act as translators... Oh and as well...
