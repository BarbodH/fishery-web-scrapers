66885,luv2drift,2007-05-02 03:40:00,147,I would just like a quick survey of your top five fly patterns and hook size for rainbows/steelhead including surface and sub-surface.
66891,MJL,2007-05-02 04:22:00,2427,"After some serious thought, I came up with these  My Top 5 producers of 2006 5. Prince nymph - Size 10-12 4. Black stonefly - Size 6-10 3. Purple Austrian variant - Size 4 2. Egg-pattern (any) - various sizes 1. Black woolly bugger - Size 8  My 5 most fun to use 5. Bunny Leech - Size 2-4 on a strip/swing retrieve 4. Clouser minnow - Size 1/0 to 2 off the pier or beach (Watch your head) 3. John Valk micro spey on a swing (Watch your shoulder on the take) 2. Black woolly bugger - Size 8 (it's a numbers pattern) 1. Wake N bake surface fly - Only caught 1 steelhead off the top with it but it was pure bliss when it took.  Haven't seen them rise since"

66897,danbo,2007-05-02 08:20:00,2646,"I agree with MJl ...but my secret weapon is... A White marabou streamer with krystal flash wound over silver tinsel for body. Use a lead-weighted belly one for deep/fast water. Bead-chain eyes & black thread for head, with a red marabou throat. Killer in warmer temps when trout will chase a swung fly. Browns too."
