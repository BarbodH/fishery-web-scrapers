66786,Spiel,2007-05-02 00:40:00,9065,"...Well I finally found a few hours to get out to a local creek for some trout action. No this is not a steelie report but rather a speckie report. This stream I've been fishing for several years now typically coughs up plenty of fat specks in the 12"" to 17"" range. But as in previous years when the opener is cold and water temps have yet to reach 50 degrees the fishing can be painfully slow. And it was slow, my buddy and I only managed to land three fish with two lost in the two hours we fished tonight. I will however endeavour to get back after the warm weekend (if it happens?) time permiting and try to improve on the numbers.  In the mean time here's the a few pictures of the creek and the fish....   It's a tough little creek to fish !   Snags are quite common.   But the rewards are well worth it as seen here in my buddies hand.   Some times well worth it  As for me well I couldn't by a speck but I did get this little beauty....   and I now know where his mama his hiding"
