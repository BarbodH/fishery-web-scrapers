67189,RLS,2007-05-02 23:09:00,8,I see Navionics 07 has a digital map of Red Lake Ontario. Has anyone seen or use the map of Red Lake and what is your opinion of the map?
67206,Guest lundboy,2007-05-02 23:38:00,0,Seems to have pretty good detail.....  Here are some photos

67219,danc,2007-05-03 00:30:00,4677,It doesn't seem that this lake has much structure. I'm no so sure that I'd buy a map for it. A depth finder should do the job.
67226,grt1,2007-05-03 01:07:00,638,I took a look at the program at the local dealer here and it seems to  be ok but for my money (price here is 250) I would just use the local maps that are $14 to see where the structure is.
67404,RLS,2007-05-03 14:51:00,8,Thanks a lot for the info. I am planning a trip to Red in June and have a paper map on order. After vewing the map I will see if it is worth the $149 US for the digital map. Man that is a deep lake; I hope my sounder is good enough to read that deep. :-)
67441,Guest lundboy,2007-05-03 17:13:00,0,"  Remember the map chip has 10,000 Canadian lakes (majority in Ontario), and it also has some road data.  If you already have a GPS unit, this is a great buy it's $195.00 CDN local (GTA), and gives you tons of maps for the money.
