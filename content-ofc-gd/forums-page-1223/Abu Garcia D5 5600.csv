67119,leighfns,2007-05-02 19:50:00,103,Bass Pro had what looked like a good deal on this real.  Just wondering what your opinion on it is?  Do you think it would be strong enough for Pike and Musky?  
67125,Raf,2007-05-02 20:08:00,3495,"just my opinion but for occasional muskie fishn, as long as you are not going nuts with lure size and weight I think it will be fine.  i do spy a lot of plastic on there and if you plan on fishn for muskie a lot, then i would look elsewhere.  looks like a fine bass/pike reel."
67163,sturgman,2007-05-02 21:50:00,249,Although I have only caught a few Musky on the one I bought from ebay it seemed fine until I blew the drag washers.. Other than that it has been good to me..Mine was $65.00 shipping included. What are they at bass pro?
67176,bigbuck,2007-05-02 22:17:00,2449,"I wouldn't be using it where there are potential world record type muskies. I bought one yesterday and it looks like a pretty decent reel for the money. For pike, bass and the occasional muskie, it should be fine. If you want a reel exclusively for the big toothy critters, get something else."
67258,ChrisK,2007-05-03 02:13:00,2772,You could cast medium sized bucktails and bodybaits for pike and muskie all day with that real. I have a smaller ABU levelwind I like to go to when taking a break from the bigger baits.....Also really great real for bass and pike in heavy cover...  Cheers !!
