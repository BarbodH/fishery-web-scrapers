If anyone knows anything about this area, fishing or otherwise it would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers,  Jen  The lake is between McKeller and Whitestone on 124 outside of Perry Sound!"

Shawanaga Lake Your On-Line Agent   RE/MAX Parry Sound Muskoka Realty Ltd., Brokerage   Property Archive     Information on Shawanaga Lake    Year the lake was surveyed  1975  Lake Size in hectares (1 hectare=2.47 acres)  221.9  Average Depth  5.8  Maximum Depth (m)  17.7  Lake Perimeter (shoreline length in kilometers)  23.7  Percent of lake shoreline fronted by Crown Land (Note: this is a rough approximation determined at the time the survey was completed)  80%  Number of resorts on the lake at the time the survey was completed  1  Number of cottages on the lake at the time the survey was completed  35  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   yellow perch  rock bass  white sucker     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Depth is in metres, so it doesn't look bad there. No gamefish listed...that seems unusual. If I were you I'd give the MNR in Parry Sound a call and ask to speak to someone, preferably a biologist about the lake.  cheers  (OhioFisherman just posted this info before me, didn't mean to post it twice. BTW, can someone please explain to me how to post just the link to a page?  )"
66872,OhioFisherman,2007-05-02 03:00:00,6623,"Solo, I don`t know if it is the best way but I bookmark the page, then come back to the OFC thread, copy the bookmark and paste it on the thread. It works for me and is something I can remember.  The river coming into the bay is pretty big, as big as some lakes down here, but you go up it a ways and there is a water fall, not big but it would require a portage. It is high enough so maybe only a salmon could jump it as I recall. Never tried to take a boat above it, there were a couple of decent size pools that we could see from shore, and we did catch a few smallish smallies out of the first pool from the bay. That was the extent of my fishing it, and I was young at the time maybe 16. I really have no clue what it is like farther up. Too many critters for me to be wandering around there."
66876,Lostchild,2007-05-02 03:13:00,153,Apparently it has good bass and pike fishing.
