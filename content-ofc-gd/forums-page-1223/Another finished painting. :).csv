66580,SlowPoke,2007-05-01 16:37:00,2984,"Nice painting indeed Pam.  As you watch your kids growing up, it's fun to observe them developing thier own personality. Watching the progress of this painting on Pam's website was much the same. Seemingly random strokes of colour coming together to depict thier true personalities.  In an attempt to broaden thier taste horizons I sometimes bribe them to try new things. One night at a buffet I offered $1.00 to try frogs legs.  Guess who boosted thier allowance that week, Sarah on the left or Hannah on the right?  Thanks again Pam, this will be a Mother's Day to remember for my wife and mother-in-law. -Brian"
