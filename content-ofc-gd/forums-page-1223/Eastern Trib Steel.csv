66458,ccmtcanada,2007-05-01 13:26:00,7971,"Well, CANADIAN COPPER and I had planned to fish on Tuesday, but we decided on Monday night.  I thought he was crazy because he was out from Sunday 7pm until 2pm yesterday!!  Anyhow, CC, bly and I headed to a spot for some night fishing, but the only fish caught was a carp by CC!!! It was a little maddening, because you could hear and see the big steelies breaking the surface all night long!!!  Well, after a while, we took CC home...poor guy was a little tired...WIMP!! LOL.  Bly and I headed to another trib and decided to drift there for a few hours.  On my fifth drift, I hooked into this beauty female!  Breaking my old PB of 26 3/4"" was this 28"" drop back hen.  It put up quite the fight, but this was the only fish I had on all night and I didn't want to lose it!!  She was caught on roe...water was gin clear and low.    If you look closely, you can see one single egg dropping from her...pretty cool.  Well, we got in late, but at least one of us caught a fish!"
