1000805,Stern Rules,2017-04-18 12:12:00,342,Found these Friday outside of Brantford. Not only out of season but a lot of wasted meat still on the carcasses. What a waste. Shame on whoever pulled this crap.       
1000900,chris.brock,2017-04-18 21:43:00,4053," Was that by the Cockshutt Bridge, lol.  It looks like the guy got cold feet and just left his haul. Disgusting."
1000902,Acountdeleted,2017-04-18 21:45:00,2562,"Jesus. What is wrong with people.  Also, can't wait for the person who caught these fish to come on the forum and say they caught them with half the meat off of them."
1000904,chris.brock,2017-04-18 21:49:00,4053,"Jesus, don't start the witch hunt! We don't know all the facts! There could be a logical explanation, hahahhaha"
1000905,Acountdeleted,2017-04-18 21:53:00,2562,Beahahahahah. Pretty much.
1000906,misfish,2017-04-18 21:58:00,29133,You mean the last report on this area might of lead to this?????????????? SAD

1000909,GBW,2017-04-18 22:11:00,8460,"I cannot even grasp as to why this was done.  As the OP said ""so much wasted"" and I don't just mean the flesh left on these either."
1000926,moxie,2017-04-19 00:00:00,1566,A waste indeed. I dont leave anything but guts when i poach. There's soup in them there bones.
