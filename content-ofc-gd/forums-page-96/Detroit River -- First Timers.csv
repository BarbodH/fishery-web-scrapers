The day started rather cool and overcast -- you forget how cold the wind can be with the water so cold in early spring.  We launched out of LaSalle -- which is a great launch with lots of parking.  We fished mostly the Canadian side, upper river providing most of our fish.  We caught 11 fish, ranging from 24 inches up to 28, and our biggest fish was just over 7 lbs.  We were jigging with 1 oz jigs, using mostly black and ""bloody mary"" coloured fin s minnows and worms with stingers.  Ian was an excellent guide.  The fishing was tough, and many other guides we spoke with didn't have much luck.  We were steady throughout the morning.  We ended up keeping 8 fish -- all but one were spawned out.  I'm sorta surprised they allow an open season for walleye when they're spawning like that, but I guess the population is healthy?  All in all a great day -- if you're looking at a guide for the DR or St. Clair I'd really recommend Ian Jones - he was excellent, and a very nice guy as well!  Here's a few pics:(the smallie was a brute, and was immediately released after a very quick pic)       "
