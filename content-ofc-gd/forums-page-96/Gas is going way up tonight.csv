Buy some free runners at the local farmer, now they taste like eggs.  The hens diet has a huge impact on flavor while shell color has nothing to do with taste. But, the mental thing gets some people and they believe one color is better than another for whatever reason. Some won't eat brown or colored eggs because they're ""gross"", which is downright silly. Winter free range eggs do not taste as good or have a deep yellow yolk like eggs laid during the warmer months because the birds aren't eating all of the organics they find while scratching.  I was selling ours for $4/dozen, until I realized I can get $10/dozen for the same eggs sold as hatching eggs. And no, there is zero difference when eating fertilized vs non fertilized eggs.  Almost time for double yolkers again. Should start seeing them around August or September.    As for gas prices, it really has me wanting to sell the 10 year old Ram with that thirsty Hemi. The bike really cuts down on gas costs (225 kms for $6-7 worth of gas), but the high prices make gassing up for fishing and hunting trips a bit more painful."
