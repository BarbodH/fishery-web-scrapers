1000495,KraTToR,2017-04-16 01:35:00,506,Never really did much trout/salmon fishing this time of year but it looks like a great way to start the season so I'm heading out of Jordon on monday AM.  Looking for a 2nd.  I dont have downriggers but I do have planers/dipsys etc.which should get the job done. ' Would like someone to join me that has some knowledge of this type of fishing please and thanks.  PM if interested.  Cheers!
