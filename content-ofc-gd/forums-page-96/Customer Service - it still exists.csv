Is is possible to order another one? What do you need to get the right model ? Thanks"" ""Hi Rick, just send us your address and we'll mail one out to you."" Thank you, Trevor   This is actually the second time I have ha d a similar experience with these guys. 3 years ago I had a Fishhhawk TD that wasn't functioning properly. I emailed them and asked about it. They sent me a new one, no questions asked.  Now, if I can just get that skunk out of the boat. "
