1000933,iFish4real,2017-04-19 00:22:00,386,"I've committed to buy a 2007, 16' Sylvan Never had one before so, I'd like to know what people here think about them. Much appreciated!"
1000934,Raf,2017-04-19 00:24:00,3495,i think sylvan is no longer a boat brand but a pontoon boat division of smoker craft.  ie.  your boat is a smoker craft and i'm sure it will be a solid rig.  enjoy.
1000936,iFish4real,2017-04-19 00:27:00,386,Must have still been Sylvan in 2007 cause it's written on the side Thanks!
1000939,msp,2017-04-19 00:36:00,1336,"I have a 16 ft Sylvan SC  2008. Great boat. Doesn't ride as smooth as a Lund but for my style of fishing its great. A higher and larger deck than the Lund . Light weight for towing , can get into some real skinny water too.Handles big Lake Ontario rollers and white caps too. raf is correct. Sylvan stopped production of their fishing boats and only makes pontoon boats now. Obviously there are better made boats out there but they come with a larger pric tag. Good luck"
1000940,iFish4real,2017-04-19 00:38:00,386,Thanks! Worth $7000 with 25hp 4st ? Everything from '07
1000942,Raf,2017-04-19 00:40:00,3495,if it gets you on the water it's worth it  you didnt give us a boat model number.
1000943,iFish4real,2017-04-19 00:42:00,386,"Not sure. All I have is 2007 16' Sylvan Resorter W/E-Z Loader trailer 25hp, console"
1000957,Dara,2017-04-19 02:05:00,3052,I have an 09 16' sc explorer Heavier model I believe. I think the resorter is a tad smaller hull without all the weight of floor and storage etc They are fine boats 7000 doesn't sound bad to me if its been well kept
1000959,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-19 02:11:00,8243,A solid boat from what I know.
1000961,camb,2017-04-19 02:17:00,3,I had a 21 ft sylvan skipper it was a great boat
1000962,chris.brock,2017-04-19 02:19:00,4053," I had a Sylvan Striker for many years and I thought it was a good, well made boat.  That Resorter is going to be a little on the slow side with a 25 but that would be easy to change if you wanted to."
1000964,iFish4real,2017-04-19 02:21:00,386,Thanks all! Can't wait to take it on the water
1000972,Garnet,2017-04-19 10:15:00,2056,My 1 st tournament boat was a 16 ft Sylvan Super Snapper. Started with a 30 tiller and upgraded to a 40 tiller.  Smoker Craft had the exact same model don't think I ever checked the price difference.
