Woodford Reserve double oaked, blantons, four roses single barrel are fantastic.  I will admit that I may not have a refined palette, but I did enjoy Collingwood Whiskey.  I am drinking some cheap Evan Williams right now and I think it's pretty good for what I paid for it.  I normally drink them neat.  I liked the Four Roses I had (i don't know which one it was, but it was a more premium batch), but honestly, I preferred the Jim Beam Black Label more."

994874,ckewley,2017-02-20 13:24:00,699,"Here's a couple that I enjoy from time to time.  Aberlour 18 YO Balvenie 15 YO single barrel sherry cask Glendronach 18 YO  Balvenie 15 Sherry Cask is phenomenal but now that it has shot up by $100.00 per bottle (Thanks KGBO!) it puts it out of range for most people, the 21 Port Cask is equally as good but again now $100.00 more so I will be sitting on my bottles for quite some time. Most of their range is quite good & consistent, not a fan of the Tun series for the price (again LCBO shot these up 300-400 over the last year) Extremely hard to beat GlenDronach's core range for price & consistency, their 12 year sherry bomb is $70,00 & a staple in my place. I'm a Islay fan so I enjoy BIG peat & smoke, Ardbeg 10 is a standard, very consistent. I have a real hard time paying more for a NAS whiskey over a age stated one not that there hasn't been some real dynamite NAS ones, I would just find a good whiskey bar & pay for a shot to try before plunking down good hard earned cash. A place like Feathers Pub or Via Allegro are a great place to start. Kilchoman is another favorite but being a smaller distillery their output can't match the big boys for volume so their prices are a bit more but well worth it IMO. Big bourbon fan too, for everyday drinking you can't beat Elijah Craig or Knob Creek  <$50. Blanton's is my personal fav but at $65 per copy it comes out once in a while, Bib & Tucker is really fine but again $100.00 per copy.. I just won through the LCBO lottery a Colonel EH Taylor single barrel bourbon that might just be the best I've ever had & seeing as such small amounts are released to the LCBO my chances of winning again are quite small so I'll be sitting on this for awhile.  just noticed this is from 2007"

995518,scugpg,2017-02-25 21:52:00,1373,I presume it's the smoke smell that is the deterrent?  Definitely takes some getting used to but the peated(think smoke like smell) scotches can be excellent. But there are some stellar scotches that are either lightly or not peated at all. Think a lot of folks smell a something like a lagavulin or Johnnie Walker black and get put off initially from the peat lol.

But thankfully there's an exception to the rule:  Laphroaig.  It's from the Western Isles and has a reputation for being ""peaty"" and somewhat of an aquired tastte.  I have a bottle left over from a trip to Scotland in '94 -- and a buddy of mine who knows I drink the stuff who's still in the Army grabbed on in the US Army PX in Guam (imagine that) on his way home from Afghanistan in '02.  I've seen Laphroaig at LCBO in the past couple years -- didn't notice the price.  10 year and 15 year stuff, I think.  I have the 10 year stuff.  It's fine.  Suits a good cigar and fireplace nicely.  Sitting here in the middle of the Southern Ontario blizzard -- I might just do that....  As far as the post about SCREECH goes -- from my time Down East I can tell you -- Screech is fine.

143549,bigbuck,2007-12-17 22:44:00,2449,"After a few scotches, you could give someone paint thinner to drink and they'd never know the difference. Seriously though, Glenfiddich used to be a nice single malt before they got all commercialized, now it's only average. Lagavulin, Glenmorangie, Glenlivet are nice. It all depends on how much you want to spend and whether or not it will be truly appreciated. I have a buddy who thought he knew all about Cognac, I was giving him Remy VS (nice but average) and had him convinced he was drinking XO (real nice and expensive). It takes a lot of time to refine your tastebuds to be able to notice the subtle nuances between liquors and wines. Have fun though, it's a blast to try different liquors. We used to hit the Niagara region and hit a dozen wineries or so for tastings, after the last one, I felt bad for the designated driver for the day because we'd all be pretty pickled."

A Lagavulin can push $100 in Ontario and be $60 in NY.  If you are looking for a good inexpensive starter type, I like Aberlore or Delviny.  But for the quality go for Oban or Lagavulin.

142710,Tomcat,2007-12-15 00:56:00,395,"Just my opinion but I contend different single malt scotches vary greatly in taste. I don't believe anyone would compare Lagavulin to Macallan. Consequently, if you're really interested in your father-in-law enjoying a bottle of scotch, ask him for his preferences. That way, you can be assured that he'll enjoy your thoughtfulness."
142718,boatman,2007-12-15 01:56:00,350,"I'm not a connoisseur like some here, but I enjoy a little Scotch. One thing I can tell you is that you can't pick a Scotch solely by its name. They can be very different. Personally, I like the mellow tasting Scotches (this is where I show my lack of Scotch knowledge). For me the general rule is the lighter the better. The dark coloured Scotches have too much bite for my liking. Currently, I have a bottle of single malt 12 year old Glen Livet in my cupboard. Its not too expensive, but good just the same. I have not had anything by Johnny Walker or Glen Fiddich, yet, that I liked. Of course, I've only sampled fewer than a dozen different single malts."
142732,John,2007-12-15 03:25:00,2956,"Scotch is distilled in regions and is quite different from region to region. My personal favourites are Islay whiskeys, Lagavulin, Bruichladdich, Bowmore. They are an aquired taste and are quite ""peaty"", ""smokey"" and some have a mild iodine aftertaste. Bowmore is probably the best value starting in the $50's but Lagavulin is my personal choice. As a bottle will last me a month, I don't mind the $90+.  Highland and Lowland malts are a little more mainstream. The Grant distillery in Speyside produces some nice whiskeys, Balvenie is one of the best in my opinion. Again from $50ish per bottle for bog standard 12 year old to $150 for an amazing 21 year old Portwood.  Grab a book or two from the library as a good start.  By the way Ken, there are no garbage malts, just some are more average than the others.  John.."
142734,JohnF,2007-12-15 03:45:00,3494, Oban is now $100. I just picked some up. I've tried to appreciate single malts but for the life of me I can't honestly say that I've found one I like better than Famous Grouse. It is far and away the nicest blended I've found.  JF

If you had $11K to blow I know where you can get a bottle of 40 yr old Bowmore..... And although its not Scotch..... The Bheag (pronounced Chay Veck) is quite nice too  All of the above mentioned too.....hard to go wrong if you dont mind spending $60-$100
142792,Cookslav,2007-12-15 15:17:00,1457,"Laphroaig, or Isle of Jura  Both are nice and affordable(although not mainstream) single Malts. But if I were you....I'd find out if he likes a Peaty scotch or malty scotch guy. If he's a connoisseur he's have a distinct type he likes.  Scotches tend to lean to one side or the other. (A Peaty scotch has an almost anise like quality, with a mouth feel that slightly numbing, while a Malty scotch is generally lighter in flavour with a sweeter finish)  Laphroaig is heavily weighted to the peaty side, while Isle of Jura is definitely a Malty Scotch."
