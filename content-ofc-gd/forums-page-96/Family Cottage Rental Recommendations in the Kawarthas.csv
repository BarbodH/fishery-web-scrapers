1000000,sneak_e_pete,2017-04-11 17:46:00,540,"Hi all.  It's been a long time since I have been on here, so first....HELLO!  I am looking to book a cottage / cabin in the Kawarthas for myself and my 3 boys (9, 8 and 5) in July, and am looking for some recommendations.  Here is what I am looking for:  Bonuses (not deal breakers) I have been saving for this trip for a year, so don't want to just book something because it looked good online.  Thanks in advance for your help!"
1000002,GBW,2017-04-11 17:58:00,8460,"The only place I have stayed at with my kids is Halimar in Haliburton.  Fishing for bass, walleye and panfish right off the dock or a short paddle boat trip into the bay.  Pool and beach for swimming.  Boat rentals too if you changed your mind as well as dock space if you were to bring a boat.  They also run a kids camp so you have some you time and sometimes they even overlap so at meals like dinner.  The food there is great.  We liked it so much we went 3 years in a row.  They knew what I liked to 'drink' after the first night and they went to the LCBO and stocked up in-case I wanted a bvg with dinner. *edit to add* they have some nice bike trails there and a golf course up the road.  They even supply bikes to use free so one less thing to pack.  If you go just make sure they have bike sizes in working order as I'm sure you can guess they get treated pretty rough from some folks..."

1000045,adempsey,2017-04-11 22:09:00,1498,http://muskiebayricelake.com/ http://www.southviewcottages.com/  Don't know about rates any longer.  It's been a while. Rates have gone stupid though.  http://lovesicklakepark.ca/ - havent been but lots of kids and near the falls.  they have some cottages
1000109,Rattletrap2,2017-04-12 15:19:00,1652,"Lake Dalrymple Resort. Ownership changed hands a few years back, but Hazel and Gail were still working there helping out. They have a nice big dock to fish off, good safe swimming, playground, campfires at night, etc. They also rent boats. I rented a boat off the new owners last year and they seemed decent. The deepest stretch of water in the whole lake (33 feet) is just out front of this place, so although it is shallow close to shore, the deep water is close. Nice Crappies and Walleye off their dock."
1000261,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-13 16:08:00,8243,"The place we used to stay at was sold and unfortunately they built a McMansion there on Clear Lake 3 years ago. It would have been perfect for you, and cheap too. I love the Kawartha's but don't get there enough. Enjoy your vacation with the boys. They will love it and love you for it. We had great trips when we were kids and went north. Veranda Beach or Puerto Backyarda, both on the north side of our house."
1000265,Sinker,2017-04-13 17:05:00,8692,I would second southview cottages. Good fishing off the docks for walleye and crappies at night.  S.
1000813,T-Bone,2017-04-18 13:51:00,160,"A little above the price point as you're in peak summer, but stellar place with great dock fishing, wonderful kids / adult activities (even tubing, etc.), nice built-in pool and just a gorgeous part of the world. We went here when my kids were young and they loved it. May be out of the price range, but if you can extend that a bit you can't go wrong here.  http://www.pinevista.com/"
