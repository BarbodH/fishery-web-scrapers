1001099,mike rousseau,2017-04-19 22:57:00,4661,Hello  I'm looking for recommendations based on experience if possible  Looking to take the family on a little trip this year  Basically not really fussy  Looking for a little cheap cabin on a lake that looks nice and has a few fish in it  Probably take my boat so a dock would be nice  Taking a 4 & 6 year old so some kid friendly stuff would be great too  I'm looking to stay within 2 hours of home so let's say within 1 hour of Ottawa or Montreal  Thanks for your help

Kelseys  Marina also has cottage rentals. Rates seem to be better. http://www.kelseysmarina.com/cottage-rentals-index-page.html  If you've never been there it's a gorgeous lake with good fishing for Lakers, Bass, Pike and panfish.  Cheers"
