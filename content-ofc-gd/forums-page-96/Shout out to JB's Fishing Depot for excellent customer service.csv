1001493,Duckie,2017-04-23 00:02:00,305,"Shout out to JB's fishing Depot in Etobicoke for excellent customer service. I had purchased a G. Loomis rod back at the spring fishing show from them (Feb) and I took it out to fish last weekend and realized there was a guide issue. When loaded, some epoxy that was split from above a guide foot would make a very loud 'click' sound which quickly became very annoying as it occurred during every cast. I called them up and they let me exchange it with no hassle at all. I wasn't looking forward to shipping the  7'1"" rod back to loomis/shimano as I thought I would have to.. Thanks JB's."
