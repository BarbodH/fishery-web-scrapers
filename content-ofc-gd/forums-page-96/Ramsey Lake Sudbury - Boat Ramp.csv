I have used the lake a few times, always launching my boat from the south end at the public ramp near Science North but it is a bit of a trek.  I have tried searching for one on Google and even used Earth to look around the lake, but the only one I can find is the one at the south end.  If anyone has any tips, that would be great.  Thanks."
