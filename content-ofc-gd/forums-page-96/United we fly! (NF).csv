I didn't think there were 2 sides to discuss!!! No matter what you think of the guy's character, it's obvious that the so-called 'overbooking' resolution was very badly handled. The flight was actually not 'overbooked'---UA decided that they need 4 seats to get employees to the destination. Did they really need to board everybody before they figured that out. Morons!!!"

United has usually offered much lower incentives than other airlines.  They have since increased the limits that staff are allowed to offer; so they may have this problem in the future.Here is a little satire on the issue.

Actually, asking someone to give up their seat after they have boarded the plane is very rare.  It may not have even been legal for the airline to bump him at this point.  Generally if you are going to be bumped from the flight; it happens before boarding.  I don't think the media really has much choice on who will be the poster boy for this issue.  What are they going to do?  Wait until someone with a less embarrassing past gets dragged off of a plane?  I am not really sure what you are getting at with the amount required for a volunteer.  There wouldn't be a media frenzy if they had a volunteer.  They didn't need Dao to volunteer; just someone on the plane.  United has some of the lowest average payouts for volunteers in the industry.  Most airlines would offer at least $1,350 before they bumped someone.  One airline stated that they have gone as high as $9,000.  If they had offered a little more, I am sure that someone who could afford to be a day late would have accepted their offer.  While Dao may be making the most of the situation.  He could hardly have planned this."

1000709,ch312,2017-04-17 19:19:00,1590,"The airline asked for volunteers to leave the plane, offering compensation up to $1000, and when nobody volunteered they chose random people. In United's contract, which passengers agree to when purchasing a ticket, it says they reserve the right to deny boarding for such reasons with boarding being defined as any time before the plane actually takes off.  Zero sympathy from me and this idiot got what he deserved for acting like a child and resisting authorities. Three other passengers were also removed from the plane and this guy is the only one who caused a scene, which says a lot about the guy. Whether you're right or wrong, resisting authorities typically doesn't end well for those who choose to resist.   Lastly, in 2016 nearly 500,000 people in the US were bumped from their flights due to overbooking. Almost half a million cases of people being bumped and this tool is the ONLY one to cause such a scene? I suppose he think's he's special."

Boarding is defined as any time before the plane takes off which makes removing this guy 100% legal, as stated in the contract when passengers purchase their ticket. With almost 500,000 passengers being bumped last year in the US alone, I can't help but assume at least a couple thousand of those were bumped after physically stepping in the plane.   This is just another case of a self entitled snob not reading the details when he purchased his ticket and agreed to United's contract/policy in the process."
1000712,Headhunter,2017-04-17 19:32:00,5703,"Well, United thought he was special! Special enough to be asked off the plane. I have been bumped, once leaving Toronto and once they attempted to bump my wife and I in Paris. We were lucky that a group of high school kids (25) were on the same flight and volunteered to stay a day in Paris, all compted. Came close to getting arrested at the airport, armed cops and all, but we got our flight and we both made it to work the next day. I agree that the ""victim"" acted like a spoiled child, but I don't agree with airlines' bumping policies. HH"

First passengers to check in get a seat or like in this case of this Doctor's flight; it was airline personal that wanted the seats. 20 some odd years ago, my wife, two kids (6&8 years old) and myself were flying back from Dubai on Air Emirates and had to transfer to Air Canada at Heathrow in London. Get to the Air Canada desk too be told there were only three seats left available. Well after already being in the air for 6 or 7 hours; we were not the most patient of people to be told this and raised a big enough stink; that they bumped someone else off the flight, as to get all 4 of us on. So the airlines can do pretty much what they want, when and if they want. Well maybe not drag a person off the plane; but I'd bet this Doctor wasn't the first to have this done too.  Dan.  "

He was right, he is suing them, everyone sues everyone else down there as well it is becoming more and more the norm here too. If I dragged someone along the ground and gave them a fat lip I would be spending the night in jail. There was no need for violence in this case. I know there was someone on that flight that would have taken fair comp. I used to hope they were looking for someone to bump me. I was given 2 free round trip tickets anywhere American flew into Florida from Buffalo for only delaying a flight to Buffalo from Ft. Myers Fla. Pick me, pick me please.  On a another note we are going fishin' tomorrow. Cats on the Grand."
