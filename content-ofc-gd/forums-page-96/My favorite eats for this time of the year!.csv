1001041,jimmer,2017-04-19 18:19:00,2730,I always look forward to catching a mess of these in the spring and having a few fish fries. They are best out of the colder water. 
1001042,GBW,2017-04-19 18:26:00,8460,"Nice, it will be a bit longer for me to get the boat in and case some fish.  Enjoy!"
1001046,Sinker,2017-04-19 18:52:00,8692,"My favourite is perch, but them gills are right up there too! I'd take them over crappies, but I love my perch! Pound for pound, those gills pull harder than anything!  S."
1001051,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-19 19:20:00,8243,"Haven't eaten a Blue Gill for years, I know some Yanks that only fish for them and Sunnys. My favorite meal this time of year is any fish straight out of the water, even Silver Bass if eaten day 1 or 2, after that even if frozen fresh they go off. A lady I know served us a Sheepshead chowder a few years back, and it was good too! Lots of Tabasco helps. I missed the Catfish fry today with the crew, hopefully I will boat a few this Friday if we don't get rained out like today."

1001110,crappieperchhunter,2017-04-20 00:18:00,2582,Still getting Simcoe perch from shore Jimmer. May 1 we move back into the cottage in Bobcaygeon and I'll be chasing me some Sturgeon and Pidgeon gills then. Looking forward to it so leave a few for me.
1001180,bigugli,2017-04-20 11:28:00,6138,gotta love a good feed of bluegill. Been getting them steady for the past few weeks.
1001181,wallyboss,2017-04-20 11:31:00,1095,Crappies with a side of wild leaks and fiddleheads.
1001183,Acountdeleted,2017-04-20 11:38:00,2562,Looks delish. Can't wait to boat some panfish.
1001192,manitoubass2,2017-04-20 12:25:00,11391,Jealous.  Numerous times I've tried to Target bluegills with little success.  I get a few here and there walleye or crappie fishing but that's about it.  Last year I got lucky shore fishing and landed like 20 in a row off this submerged dock cribbing. Musta been a big school traveling upriver
1001468,Joeytier,2017-04-22 14:46:00,3990,Love spring pannies.  Those gills are just pure muscle.
