1001257,OhioFisherman,2017-04-20 17:47:00,6623,"Lol I'd say so.  Hey it works both ways though.  Your pup is safe. Mine attack wolves and Badgers.  Opposite ends of the spectrum  So your dog sounds like a wuss lol, mine make me a wuss since im constantly worried their fate is sealed each time they run  Glad there aren't any big critters here, well except coyotes and deer, don't want him getting himself in trouble, the other wandering dogs are enough. He is not that much of a wuss, he has no problem attacking neighbor's alpha labradoodle if he gets a chance. Funny they have 5 - 6 dogs, that is the only one he has an issue with."

I felt like a passenger on the trips out and back and yah, when Rolloff shook the water off his back, tears! Thanks so much for sharing this! Hysterical! HH"

1001365,Headhunter,2017-04-21 15:21:00,5703,"Yah, as an owner of a Lab, I kept thinking that it was my dog out there chasing the ball, which he would do all day! I think I'll re-watch it as my day hasn't been the best so far, but that video will help a lot! Thanks again Simon! HH"

1001386,4x4bassin,2017-04-21 20:13:00,1025,"Video looks great Simon , might look into that mount for my dog . On a side note and just throwing it out there for those who don't know ( I didn't till last spring) Dogs , specifically labs and other sporting breeds develop what is known as ""broken tail"" or ""dead tail"" from swimming in ice cold water for any length of time . My dog loves the water and will swim all day and last spring we were out throwing the ball around a local lake a week or two after ice out and she developed this issue . It was very painful for her and her tail actually looked like it was ""broken"" Took a couple days to recover and everything was good again but definitely no more lengthy cold water swims for her any more . Just thought I would mention this in case anyone out there ever experiences something like this with there own dog."

1001010,Cast-Away,2017-04-19 15:38:00,790,Well if you dog wasn't fixed I am sure that the ice cold water would do the trick!
1001025,Tomcat,2017-04-19 16:38:00,395,Nice result with the Go Pro attached to Roloff. Thanks for sharing.

Nice result with the Go Pro attached to Roloff. Thanks for sharing.  Kinda cool huh, I made some money from my youtube account and use it as my equipment fund, took 4 months to get $400, but that will get me a GoPro Karma grip which is waterproof. Its basically a handheld, waterproof 3 axis gimbal for liquid smooth footage, dog will look like a cyborg with it attached but he's a good sport and the footage should be interesting and cool!  Hahaha that's awesome!   Neat eh? shame there are only three dog lovers on this forum...lol. ( I know, sarcasm is the lowest form of humour) I'm getting paranoid now, once upon a time i'd post and get a whole bunch of replies and banter, like pages of it, LOL...I blame Trump....that should get things going."
