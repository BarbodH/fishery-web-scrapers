1001090,Locnar,2017-04-19 22:23:00,645,"Hey guys, a couple buddies and i are looking to get out for channel cats... do you know if there is a boat launch on jordan harbour? Or if there is any other spot either down that we could launch at and fish for kitties?  Or is there is a boat launch on Percy reach? I hear there may be some kitties out there as well?  Any help is much appreciated, Cheers"
1001108,kuhaman,2017-04-20 00:02:00,503,The Beacon at Jordan harbour has a launch but I think the lower Grand river in Dunnville would be much more productive. Check out Fishmasters website.
1001111,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-20 00:27:00,8243,"The lower Grand is your best chance for Cats, and some big Kitties too. If you see my Blue on White StarCraft say hi. Go out of Fishmasters and get some of his stinky bait. Along with some uncooked shrimp. Use circle hooks and a heavy slip weight of at least 3/4 oz. Put a bead where the wt. hits the swivel. We've caught them trolling worm harnesses and a worm this time of year too. I wouldn't bother with Jordan. Good eaters too this time of year."
1001114,Locnar,2017-04-20 00:54:00,645,"So Jordan is not a great spot eh? Too many bullheads to weed through? Dunnville is a bit of a hike for us, I'll see what buddy thinks of it. I got some cut sucker, do you think that'll work well on the Grand? Does he charge much to use the launch? I'll let you know Old Ironmaker if we decide on the hitting the Grand. None of us have ever fished for channel cats, so it'll be interesting trying to figure it all out.  Thanks again guys."
1001138,leaf4,2017-04-20 02:06:00,2466,You can launch free out of port Maitland and take the channel left and get into them there... Out to the right is erie
1001145,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-20 02:17:00,8243,"The free launch is good as long as there isn't a south wind, it can bang around your boat real good. Fishmaster's launch was 5 bucks last year. Cut sucker is what they sell there at Fishmaster's. Like I said uncooked shrimp works some days suckers don't. It isn't complicated fishing. Find a hole, toss in the line and wait. Go to You tube and watch Charlie Wray's video fishing there on the Grand. He has made a few shows with the Fishmaster, Steve Hardcastle. I'm positive you will find the video. Fishfull Thinking is Charlie's TV show.  From Whitby to Dunnville is not really much further than to Jordan. QEW to Red Hill Valley Parkway South, 56 HWY south to HWY 3 east to Dunnville. The short cut is to go through Caisterville.  Here I found it for you.  "

1001158,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-20 02:50:00,8243,"I'm glad I re watched it. I have mono for my leaders, should have braid."
1001165,Locnar,2017-04-20 03:11:00,645,"Are they rocking two rods each? Thanks again, we'll probably head down there and give'r a go!"
1001170,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-20 04:23:00,8243,No only 1 rod each in the river. On Lake Erie you can use 2 per fisherman. Don't forget the camera and sound man can put out a rod as well.

1001222,Court R,2017-04-20 15:55:00,213,"Jordan is a great spot as well as the Grand, I would try the harbor if that is closer for you, you don't need a boat there are some shore spots to fish, one spot would be at Bailys bridge and walk north towards the harbor with it gets a bit wider, pulled many cats up to 20lbs out of there.."
