1000598,chong,2017-04-16 23:51:00,102, What do you guys think of the curado hg for jerkbaits? will it hold enough line? (14lb fluoro) or should i get a bigger reel?
1000630,FrankTheRabbit,2017-04-17 01:58:00,479,http://www.tackletour.com/previewshimanocurado70.html  The TT review mentions filling around 70yds of 14lb fluoro. The will prob also depend what line you use since each manufacuturer varies their line diameter.
1000993,MCTFisher9120,2017-04-19 13:30:00,3761,The 70 size should be fine with your 14lb you should get a little over 200' on that reel. I use the Aldebaran 50HG for jerk bait's and use 10lb fluorocarbon on that setup. I make long casts and still have more than half the spool full. (Reaction FC Fluoro)
