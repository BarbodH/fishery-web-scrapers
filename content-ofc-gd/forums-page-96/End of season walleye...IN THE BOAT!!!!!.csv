My buddies came out with me and we had a hoot, nothing too big but enough for a supper in the near future.   "

1000513,spincast,2017-04-16 13:13:00,3279,"LOL. The fact is Simon - we just hate you.  Anyone who lives that close to perfect fishing and is already nailing a fresh walleye feed from the boat, well I mean what can you say that won't sound petty or  jealous?  Next you're gonna rub salt in the wounds with a big ice out pike and turn your nose up - hrmmpf, jackfish  I need to get back up there. May try for a run this summer is everything works out"

I get lots of requests from youtube to guide, but so far have chickened out, guiding puts a whole new spin on the fishing experience, It kind of reminds me of a quote attributed Mark Twain, "" Golf, a good walk ruined"",  if you think of golf as guiding and a good walk as a good days fishing....lol."
