1000324,4x4bassin,2017-04-14 03:45:00,1025,Just throwing this out there for those that are heading up to Algonquin for the trout opener . I received notification today that all backcountry permits are delayed till April 28 thus putting a hold on getting to your favorite back lake in Algonquin for the opener . All lakes in the area are mostly ice covered and they don't expect them to be clear for at least another week or two . The back roads and portages are still snow/ice covered as well .

1001382,4x4bassin,2017-04-21 19:39:00,1025,Just been looking at some pictures from Algonquin (Opeongo) and there won't be any fishing in those lakes over the next couple days unless you have an auger . Completely ice covered with a bit of melt around the shorelines. Next weekends schedule opening could be in jeopardy but it will be close with some nice weather coming in over the next week.
1001389,muskymatt,2017-04-21 20:44:00,2608,I'd say from past years experience the 28th still looks good. Fingers crossed.
