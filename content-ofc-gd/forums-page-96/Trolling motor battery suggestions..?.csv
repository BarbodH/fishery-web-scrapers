1001296,kenzy31,2017-04-20 22:29:00,261,"I picked up a 24V Motorguide 82lb trolling motor a couple weeks ago and I'm in the market for two batteries. Value or ""bang for my hard earned buck"" is what I'm looking for. I've heard good things about Kirkland batteries, anybody here vouch for that? What about Duracell deep cycles? Any experience? My neighbour might be able to get me a deal through a friend. And another question, Group27 or 31 size? Space isn't an issue, lots of room for 31's but is the difference in performance worth the price? Thanks for the input y'all, tight lines! Less than 2 weeks until pike opener so good luck all!

1001297,Mister G,2017-04-20 22:32:00,1429,Group 31's and you will never regret it...............I was just out (few days ago) using my Minn Kota for 6 straight hours and it still had 3/4 battery charge left.
1001301,porkpie,2017-04-20 23:12:00,2521,"Buy the 31's.  Walmart has everstarts for around $135 a piece.  Kirkland doesn't sell 31's, at least not that I've ever seen."

1001412,fundseeker,2017-04-21 23:24:00,27,I bought the Walmart 31's last fall for a 24 Volt  80 lb Terrova. Worked well on warm and cold days so far. After doing a lot of research it didn't seem worthwhile going for other than wet cell batteries. I spent the extra $ on the expensive on board Minn Kota charger to keep the moderately priced batteries in optimum condition.
