The path to allowing MJ will be just as long and hard as the path alcohol took to being legalized. Mistakes will be made and lives enriched or ruined is the norm for allowing another mind altering substance into modern living. So right or wrong here it comes educate yourselves so you can decide how it impacts your lives and the loved ones around you.   Art

My independent study from going to U of T 69 to 74 , when Yorkville was still a street of hippies and Roachdale College was still going strong , I'd say unequivocably that pot use was higher then.  If the stuff back then was anywhere near the strength of the stuff today though you might have seen more negatives from it's use, while still the same plant you are comparing apples and oranges."

With weed, I'd guess it could be counted on a hand or two.  That said... people just gotta be careful either way.  Just this winter alone I have seen three different ugly truths with weed... The most extreme as an example... An acute psychosis resulted in a gruesome mutilation and death of one's own left hand with a meat clever.  Same guy on booze is just a wild party animal, I hear.  MJ may not have killed his brain cells, just altered this guys enough for him to nearly chop his hand off.  It was ""JUST WEED"" alone that triggered this.  An extreme and rare case, yes, and only one of two in 18 years doing the job which turned that extreme.  But pot for some with underlying psychiatric issues such as Schizophrenia can trigger nasty reactions.  It does happen!  But compared to booze issues, it's just a drop in the bucket.  Alcohol can be devastatingly damaging as we all are aware.  Drink and toke responsibly!"

I would always rather deal with someone stoned on weed than hammered on booze. I have never heard of someone high on weed rob a bank with a weapon. Maybe a slow speed chase ala ""Up in Smoke"".  I caught the tail end on the radio today when the Minister of Health Canada was laying out proposed guidelines for weed. She did say 18 years and older holding 30 grams or less will not be a chargeable offense. 4 plants grown at home no more than a metre high will be allowed.

I think the daily users in those days would have been a bit higher than 9 to 10%, but then again, I was one of them for at least 3 of the 4 years so my sample is probably biased.

997502,GbayGiant,2017-03-21 12:18:00,1780,"Out of all the research that’s being done around the world into the many beneficial uses of medical marijuana, epilepsy is one of the most studied conditions. From the use of CBD oil to treat Dravet Syndrome, to the scientific evidence that people with epilepsy may have an endocannabinoid deficiency, it is clear that epileptics around the world have something for which to be hopeful. Now, two major studies in Canada are being executed to examine the potential benefits of medical marijuana in pediatric epilepsy patients. The first comes from Dr. Richard Huntsman, who is a pediatric neurologist and professor at the University of Saskatchewan. Huntsman, along with Dr. Richard Tang-Wei, a pediatric epileptologist at the University of Alberta, will be examining the effects of cannabis oil in childhood epilepsy. The research will examine the effects cannabis oil has on treating the disorder, and will also investigate how cannabis can directly improve the quality of life for children with the disorder. In an interview with CTV News, Huntsman said, “For me, I would feel as a parent, having better quality of life would be just as important as control of seizures, so that’s something we really want to look at.” The study will examine 30 children with severe epilepsy between the ages of 1 and 10 years old. These kids have have either not responded to regular treatments, or have significant side effects from the use of traditional pharmaceuticals. Some of these children have 50 to 300 seizures a day and struggle with basic life skills as well as regressed development. Many parents have told Huntsman that they already give their children cannabis oil to help control their epilepsy despite the fact that researchers are still not completely sure as to why cannabis works so effectively on the condition. “It seems to have an effect on certain neurotransmitter receptors in the brain,” Huntsman said. The study is being partially funded by the Children’s Hospital Foundation of Saskatchewan and the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation. Concurrently, researchers at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children are beginning a study on the use of cannabis extracts to treat children with severe epilepsy. That study will examine 20 children with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 1 to 18 years."

Sorry Sterling have to disagree with your comment on the developing mind crapola. So according to you since cannabis use has gone up hugely since the 70s 80s that psycosis and other mental issues must have gone up as well. But if you do some research and check that is not the case. Mental disorders haven't kept up to cannabis smokers at all. Nice try.  This crapola is confirmed by every study ever done on weed's effect on the developing brain. Who would have thought that a psychoactive drug would alter a young brain???  Here's a gigantic list of scholarly studies confirming this: https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?q=cannabis+effect+on+adolescent+brain&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiahcet_ufSAhUm34MKHbrmBKkQgQMIGjAA  As a regular user myself, I wouldn't care if my kids used, so long as it's past the ~20 year mark.

While taking constant cigarette breaks or having a few too many drinks during happy hour has become socially acceptable in the business world over the past several decades (just watch an episode of Mad Men), admitting to marijuana use has remained off-limits — even as we enter a post-legalization era. That doesn’t mean, however, that some of the most successful business leaders in the world have completely abstained. In fact, some of the world’s most celebrated visionaries have not only admitted to using cannabis in the past, but they continue to use it. Now that the social stigma is starting to fade, it’s only a matter of time before even more people become open about their cannabis use. Although we’re headed in what many people would consider the right direction in terms of our attitudes toward marijuana, that doesn’t give the average American worker a free pass to smoke, vape, or otherwise ingest. You can still be fired for marijuana use, after all, even if it’s within the confines of state law. Some are also worried the Trump administration could crack down on marijuana, a big shift from the hands-off approach of the past president. But to illustrate the point, we’ve compiled a short list of successful CEOs who have, at one time or another, provided a bit of insight into their own marijuana use. For some of these people, their relationship with cannabis ended decades ago. For others, it’s become a daily ritual. Either way, they go to show using marijuana doesn’t need to be a career-ending decision. Here are some of the business world’s most successful marijuana users. No. 6 is a co-founder of one of the most valuable companies in the world, while No. 10 is more likely to pass you a handmade cookie than a joint. ou might remember George Zimmer as the former CEO of Men’s Wearhouse. He’s the guy who would famously say, “You’re going to like the way you look. I guarantee it.” Well, Zimmer was fired a few years ago. And that’s a bummer. But Zimmer is still one of the more famously successful marijuana users in the business world. He has admitted to being a user for half a century, in fact. He now acts as an advocate for legalization and even told CNBC that marijuana prohibition was “the biggest con that has been perpetrated on this country in the last century.” Ted Turner is a media mogul, as the man behind many television stations, including CNN, TNT, TBS, and more. He’s also a long-time marijuana user. It only makes sense that the man who pretty much invented the 24-hour news cycle would be under the influence. Rumor is he was even caught growing pot in his dorm room while attending college. Billionaires don’t often admit to using cannabis, but Richard Branson is an exception. He even sat down for an interview with High Times to dig into the subject a little bit. He’s also gone head to head with politicians regarding marijuana use, comparing it to alcohol and saying the vast majority of people who use cannabis in moderation end up being perfectly fine. ary Johnson is more famous for being a politician than a CEO. He served as the governor of New Mexico for eight years from the mid-1990s until the early 2000s and ran for president as a Libertarian in 2012 and 2016. A regular marijuana user, he said in an interview with USA Today that he abstained during his presidential run because he wanted to be “completely on top of my game.” Previously, he was CEO of Cannabis Sativa, Inc., which focuses on development"

But I have read a few posts in this discussion that offend me.  I am not addicted to weed. I am a 40 year old manufacturing technologist and have been a recreational user for the last 22 years. I am not a ""loser"" and people that know me would agree that I am successful.  Cigarettes, coffee, fishing. These are things that I am addicted to. I've gone weeks without weed and suffered zero withdrawal. I'm sure I could quit cigarettes and coffee too. But any time I've tried, the urge brings me back. Quit fishing? Never gonna happen. Lol.  I know people that are drug addicts. They feel the need to be high all the time. At some point in their lives, they all experimented beyond the herb. If they continued using ""hard"" drugs, I doubt they would be able to hold down jobs. These people are able to keep thir urges in check by using marijuana. They know that the high isn't the one they are striving for. But it satisfies the urge and allows them to stay above level. One of these friends educated me on his addiction and it really helped me understand how hard drug users function. They rarely have money and holding down a job is a reality that they soon give up on.  Recreational use allows people like me to relax and chill. It allows people with strong addictions to get a high that satisfies their addiction and helps them forget about the high that they were craving."

More of you than I thought. So maybe I am wrong and my experience growing up was a bad sample.  I will say that if someone said they drank to get a buzz on every day for 20 plus years, I would think that might be a problem. If you have smoked weed every day for 20 or more years with only short times when you didn't, I am sorry, but that sounds like some form of addiction to me. And don't equate coffee addiction or cigarettes with weed or booze. I would let a pilot fly me in a plane after a coffee and cigarette.  Look I am all for live and let live. And I hope I am wrong and the world will still spin around once a day and all will be fine. Probably will be for most people.  And no doubt for those that need medical use, it will be vastly better.  Hell, once its legal I might have a puff once in a while. Nah. Probably not. I kinda like the reality I live in without augmenting it.  But that's just me.

997279,manitoubass2,2017-03-18 03:05:00,11391,"I have a really good book on the pyschology of addictions.  Marijuana is addictive, just not in the means most think of as addiction.  Physiologically stopping marijuana use is of no concern  Psychologically it could cause issues however if the user stops. But again, it's vastly different from other addictive compounds.  Show me any activity or compound that is enjoyable, or eases burdens, and it's psychologically addictive in some sense.   I've never seen marijuana use destroy a family though, unless it's through illegal drug dealing. Not saying it doesn't happen, I'm sure it does. I'm not buying it on a scale that one would seem a significant issue.  Also, new studies are suggesting marijuana usage to be safe and effective means of treating addictions and even improving mental health.  Opiates for example, withdrawal can include violent bouts of naseau(marijuana treats that), use causes weight loss and poor nutrient uptake(marijuana treats that) opiate withdrawal effects proper sleep(marijuana treats that) opiate withdrawal creates dopamine and serotonin imbalances(marijuana treats that), opiate withdrawal can cause heavy bouts of physical pain/discomfort(marijuana treats that) opiate withdrawal can cause seizures(marijuana treats that)  I mean, just to name a few. This list is 100% true of alcohol withdrawal as well.  The more marijuana is studied, the question is quickly becoming ""why isn't everyone using marijuana products""?"

If you do it enough during a day over and over again it becomes habit forming like anything else can be.

I know plenty of heavy weed users that 1. are addicted to pot 2. are negatively effected by it from over use....if you want to argue to the contrary you can try, but observation is all i need as well.  Just like basically anything, too much of anything is not good for you...you can mess yourself up from drinking too much water as well..its all relative.  You guys can claim that iron is spreading mis-information, but i feel like if you are telling people that regular heavy use of weed has absolutely 0 negative impacts you are also spreading mis-information.  I smoke too much i feel like crap the next day...if i eat too many doritos the same thing happens.  stranger things have happened, but the last thing I would want someone around here to do is read a thread that says you can do as much pot as you want and have no negative effects...i know its unlikely but you never know."

997312,Canuck,2017-03-18 20:51:00,491,"Wading in late, and may regret it  I'm 53 and spent the majority of late elementary and high school smoking weed, hash and oil.  I was one of those kids that worked hard and got good marks in school, but liked to have a good time too.  Because of my smoking I had two groups of friends - The ones that made weed a priority in our lives and the ones that did't smoke or not much.   Then in grade 12 I realized the heavy pot smokers were not planning on going to 13 or college or university and most of the other group was.  I smoked maybe 20 joints in 4 years of university.  It was there (so were all the other drugs), but only the Caribbean students seemed to smoke all the time.  In my experience I think there is a relationship between use of pot (or any mind altering drug) and success where motivation and drive is needed.  It kinda makes sense.  Heavy pot use makes you chill and less motivated. I don't give a rats a$$ if its physically addictive or not.  I think if they ever did a study about ""life success"" for pot smokers vs those who moved on and grew up, I think there would be really noticeable difference.  I don't just mean financial success.  I mean stable job, nice house, stable family - that kind of success.  For those of you that smoke weed a lot.  I mean no disrespect at all.  I don't think you should be treated like criminals or risk jail time or anything like that.  Its my choice not to smoke, and your choice to smoke.  But have you ever thought if it has had any effect on your success in life?  If not, no harm, no foul I guess.  What about your friends?  Do you think that it has affected any of their success?  For all of you that are employers or make hiring decisions, humour me with an informal survey: You have two guys interviewing for a job at your company.  One says he likes to spend his weekends smokin with his buds.  The other one says they like to hang with the buds and have a few beers.  Who you gonna hire?   What does that say?  Discrimination?  I don't think so.  For me, decriminalizing pot makes 100% sense.  Allowing it for legitimate medical reasons I am absolutely 100% for.  But legalizing it, I am not for at all.  I am not convinced that society will be able to prevent the vulnerable from making their lives worse than they could be.  For those of you that smoke weed a lot.  No disrespect at all.  I don't think you should be treated like criminals or risk jail time or anything like that.  Its my choice not to, and your choice to smoke."

996899,GbayGiant,2017-03-13 22:25:00,1780,"Liberal CFO a pot multimillionaire MONTREAL — Liberal Party of Canada CFO Chuck Rifici has become a multimillionaire in just a few months thanks to his stock-traded medical marijuana company, QMI Agency has learned. Documents show Rifici's initial investment in Tweed Marijuana Inc. has so far sprouted into an $18-million bumper crop. Rifici co-founded Tweed and served as its CEO until he resigned on Aug. 27. He remains on the company's board. According to financial statements, Rifici's fortune exploded after Tweed's initial public offering in April 2014, when it became one of the first to sell legal marijuana under a new Health Canada licensing system. Rifici obtained some of his shares directly and other shares were purchased at 89 cents each. Tweed shares are now worth $2.36 and the company's value is $ 95 million, according to Bloomberg. This sets the value of Rifici's shares at $ 21 million. Tweed's net worth has fluctuated between $20 million and $100 million since the IPO. With Rifici owning a 22.1% stake in the company, his shares were worth between $4.4 million and $22.1 million, according to financial documents. Rifici, a Franco-Ontarian, is a staunch supporter of Justin Trudeau, who has advocated that marijuana be legalized. ""I like his ideas, I'm not hiding that,"" Rifici told QMI earlier this summer at Tweed's factory in Smiths Falls, Ont. Health Canada says the number of Canadians using medicinal marijuana is expected to rise tenfold over the next decade, to 450,000 people. The market could be worth $1.3 billion by 2024, the department says. ""We'll have to meet this demand,"" said Rifici. His is one of just 13 companies with licences to legally sell pot. Tweed grows its pot in the town's old Hershey chocolate factory. A police station is right across the street. Although the marijuana is officially used for therapeutic purposes, marketing is very prominent in Tweed's sales pitch. The Tweed logo is front and centre on the company's website, which also features branded pot products with names such as Weaver, Bogart and High Lands. In an Aug. 27 news release announcing his resignation as Tweed's CEO, Rifici said he was stepping down ""to help the company recruit a CEO with the skills and experience to take Tweed to the next level of expected high-volume and rapid growth in this aggressive market segment."" Rifici and the Liberal Party were not available for comment as of press time. Medical pot smoke and mirrors, say doctors Despite a very lucrative business and a very aggressive marketing, the Canadian Medical Association said in a 2011 position paper that it has ""concerns about the lack of evidence on the risks and benefits associated with the use of marijuana."" Quebec's College of Physicians went even further in a directive to its members in April, saying ""the use of dried cannabis for medical purposes is not a recognized treatment."" The Quebec professional order recommends its members exercise extreme caution before prescribing the drug. Health Canada says it allowed companies to legally produce marijuana because the old system, where patients grew their own pot, had spiralled out of control. There were reports of infiltration by organized crime as well as sick people selling pot to healthy buyers.(proven wrong in court) In 2013, the last full year under the old system, licensed patients were consuming 17.7 grams of pot per day even though it's believed they only needed between one and three grams daily. ""The courts forced us to accept the use of medical marijuana,"" said Health Canada spokesman Sean Upton. He points out that according to current research, marijuana is ""bad for health"" and that its use should not be encouraged. Watchdogs' joint warning about 'green gold' rush In June, Canada's securities regulators urged investors to be careful about pouring their money into medical marijuana stocks. ""Just the announcement of intent to develop a medical marijuana business has resulted in an immediate rise in a company's stock price,"" said the statement by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). ""The CSA is concerned investors may face financial harm by purchasing such shares at an inflated price before there is a viable business."" History of medical marijuana in Canada: 1999: Health Canada allows individuals to possess marijuana or grow it in limited quantities for medical purposes. 2001: An Ontario judge rules the ban on marijuana possession is unconstitutional unless it includes an exemption for medical marijuana. Health Canada introduces a regulatory framework. 2002-2013: The number of licensed medical marijuana smokers rises from 477 to 29,888. 2014: Health Canada introduces new system that restricts medical marijuana sales and production to commercial, licensed producers."

In a statement of claim filed with Nova Scotia's Supreme Court, Wagners alleges that Mettrum breached its contract with consumers and that its development, distribution and sale of medical marijuana was negligent. Canopy Growth, Canada's largest publicly traded medical marijuana producer, purchased Mettrum earlier this year. A spokesman for Canopy Growth said Tuesday he couldn't comment immediately on the lawsuit because he hadn't seen it. Lawyer Ray Wagner says representative plaintiff Neal Partington, a house painter from Nova Scotia, says he suffered severe nausea and vomiting over the six months that he was taking Mettrum products to deal with symptoms of an injury. Wagner says it could take six to eight months before the court decides whether to certify the class-action lawsuit. The allegations in the statement of claim have not been proven in court. Canopy Growth CEO Bruce Linton has said that the use of unregistered pest control products was ""inexcusable"" but that Health Canada had determined the pesticide wasn't likely to cause any adverse health consequences.

995883,GbayGiant,2017-03-01 16:35:00,1780,"Trump administration’s dubious claims about pot and opioids are dead wrong   The Trump administration hinted yesterday of a forthcoming federal crackdown in the eight states that have elected to regulate their marijuana markets. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer alleges that such federal intrusion is necessary in order to try and stem the rising tide of prescription opioid abuse sweeping across various parts of the nation. Spicer stated , “I think that when you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people (by regulating the adult use of marijuana).” Yet even a cursory look at the available evidence finds Spicer’s concerns to be misplaced and his allegations to be dead wrong. In reality, permitting legal access to cannabis is consistently associated with reduced rates of opioid use, abuse, and mortality.  For example, a widely publicized study in the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine reported that the enactment of medical marijuana legalization laws is associated with year-over-year reductions in opioid analgesic overdose mortality. Overall, researchers determined, “States with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8 percent lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate compared with states without medical cannabis laws.” The JAMA study is hardly unique.  A 2015 examination by investigators at the RAND Corporation similarly determined, “tates permitting medical marijuana dispensaries experience a relative decrease in both opioid addictions and opioid overdose deaths compared to states that do not.” A 2016 assessment by Castlight Health, an employee health benefits platform provider, reported that adults are more than twice as likely to engage in doctor shopping for opioids in states without cannabis access as compared to states that permit it. Allowing adults legal access to marijuana is also associated with the reduced use of other, potentially more dangerous prescription drugs. For example, investigators at the University of Georgia assessed the relationship between medical marijuana legalization laws and physicians' prescribing patterns in 17 states over a three-year period. Specifically, researchers assessed patients' consumption of and spending on prescription drugs approved under Medicare Part D in nine domains: anxiety, depression, glaucoma, nausea, pain, psychosis, seizures, sleep disorders, and spasticity. Authors reported that prescription drug use fell significantly in seven of the nine domains assessed. ""Ultimately, we estimated that nationally the Medicare program and its enrollees spent around $165.2 million less in 2013 as a result of changed prescribing behaviors induced by ... jurisdictions that had legalized medical marijuana,” they concluded. Similar results appeared earlier this month in a new study published in The International Journal of Drug Policy. Investigators reported that patients’ prescription use of opioids, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants fell significantly when they had legal access to marijuana. Studies of chronic pain patients similarly find that cannabis’ analgesic properties are sufficiently effective to motivate patients to reduce their opioid intake or to give the drugs up all together. For instance, a recent assessment of chronic pain patients by University of Michigan researchers reports “a 64 percent decrease in opioid use, decreased number and side effects of medications, and an improved quality of life” following cannabis intervention. Another trial, conducted last year in conjunction with the Israeli government, similarly reported a 44 percent reduction in opioid use among pain patients who had access to legal pot. Separate clinical trials also indicate that marijuana may play a role in assisting some subjects kick their opioid dependence. In fact, several studies now show that the moderate use of cannabis is associated with greater treatment attention among this struggling population. Proponents of marijuana prohibition have long alleged that experimentation with pot acts as a ‘gateway’ to the use and eventual abuse of other illicit substances. But the evidence does not support this claim. In reality, permitting marijuana sales to be regulated by licensed, state-authorized distributors rather than by criminal entrepreneurs and pushers of various other illicit drugs results in fewer, not more, Americans abusing other, potentially more dangerous substances. Paul Armentano is the deputy director of NORML (the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and an adviser for Freedom Leaf. He is the co-author of the book ""Marijuana Is Safer: So Why Are We Driving People to Drink?"" (Cheslea Green, 2013) and author of the book ""The Citizen's Guide to State-By-State Marijuana Laws"" (Whitman Press, 2015)."

At least in my area, police will not press charges on unlicensed growers because they keep losing in court It is 100% legal for Medical Patients and why the LPs have used this idea(guise) to get to the recreational market they want only..."
996859,manitoubass2,2017-03-13 18:18:00,11391,"Yes, very disturbing. I wouldn't even doubt making people sicker was part of the plan to make it appear marijuana was causing people harm."

996861,AKRISONER,2017-03-13 18:22:00,5558,"honestly giant when you consider how the alcohol lobby is run in Ontario is it any surprise at all that the big medical producers will be the ones that also run the recreational market?  the last thing that the govermnent wants to do is create a free for all where the exact reality becomes the same one that the anti legalization sentiment has been preaching about for years. Aka, kids buying pot from anyone anywhere.  The more red tape they put up the safer they are from avoiding the problems they are facing in the states with no oversight of the suppliers. Yes, we there is a major issue when companies like OGI are using banned pesticides on their products...but at least we are aware that this has happened, and they are going to be held accountable for it. I would prefere this scenario over one where we end up with the exact same problems that we have with criminalized pot...aka Organized Crime being the supplier and putting god knows what in your product.  Accountability is a good thing, especially with these companies being traded in the public market...its great to be a conspiracy theorist and talk about how these publicly traded companies are poisoning us etc etc...but real regulations exist to make sure that both customers and shareholders in these companies are obtaining all of the information that they require. When a CEO starts hiding information from his shareholders and gets caught...he goes to jail.  Its hard to convey my thoughts clearly by writing on here...but lets not start bringing conspiracy theories into the discussion surrounding legalization...that sounds exactly like something a bunch of stoners would say...surprise surprise.  The whole purpose of legalization is not to allow a bunch of pot heads buy weed everywhere. The purpose is to regulate a gigantic industry that is currently operating illegally while effectively cutting the financial burden of the massive amounts on enforcement required to regulate it, while also taking money out of organized crime's hands. At the same time still providing those that need it for medicinal purposes with consistent effective medicine.  I get it GBAY you wanna use weed every day and have it free to you all the time...dont get me wrong...i love weed too...but you arent convincing anyone that its a good idea for absolutely everyone to be using the stuff every day...its not...i wouldnt tell you to take a tylenol, or aspirin, or have a coffee every day either.  Lobbys are lobbys, if you want this industry to go legit...then its going to be subject to the same rules that every other industry in canada has, and be part of the capitalist system that Canada has. To me I would prefer it that way. Im excited to see some legitimate business men involved with the industry. They have turned Canada into a world economic power, hopefully this fledgling industry can become a massive exporter of Canadian products world wide in the near future. providing jobs, and massive economic benefits to everyone here at home. The right people to get it there are the exact people that you are somewhat demonizing for being venture capitalists...good for them hopefully they make their weed businesses the biggest best companies in this sector in the entire world.  TLDR...Keep weed companies publicly traded, regular regulation will keep everyone honest. If you dont believe capitalism is a good system, move to cuba."
996862,jimmer,2017-03-13 18:27:00,2730,It was interesting to read Manitou's results of the topical usage.  I might have to look into that for all my arthritic joints (no pun intended).  Would you get this through the route you took?  How long did the relief actually last?  I have no luck with anything that is out on the market for topical application.
996865,manitoubass2,2017-03-13 18:33:00,11391,"Conspiracy theories???  Not sure where that comes in?  And there is no ""laced"" weed. That's a total farce. Any smoker will know immediately if there product is laced by taste smell of the product.  Also, if I'm a dealer, does it makes sense to put a more expensive drug into the cheaper drug and selling at the cheaper drugs cost????  Gbay is bang on, this is gonna get real ugly really quickly now that the info is out."
996866,AKRISONER,2017-03-13 18:33:00,5558,"also..yes OGI did some shady stuff...the market/lawsuits will handle that...have faith in regulation. I personally wouldnt be trading in that company if someone gave me free money to trade with. Thats how the free market economy works. You screw up, you get sued and fined into oblivion...Ask Volkswagen about that.  The conspiracy theory is that all of the medical producers are ""poisoning us""  What a shame...i have no clue what the hell the hells angels have put in my weed the last 20 years either...and no one will ever know because it was being illegally grown.  These guys got caught and will now suffer the consequences...thats how the system is supposed to work."

I've gained 35% mobility back in my knee since starting. My blood clot didn't respond UNTIL is used marijuana extracts.

Also comes with a Dr. Consult and follow ups at month 1,3,6,9  No additional yearly fee for option 1  $149 renewal fee for option two"

I am amazed how effective a topical is considering fat soluble compounds usually suck in dermal carriers.  Tomorrow is going to much different however. The experimenting dosages/products begin.  Also, grown hydroponically on site, no sprays. Even tested the CBD and THC content of each product before my eyes  Great service and the Dr. Was incredibly knowledgeable(not just on marijuana, my injuries suffered and prescription meds etc)"

You go from there. It is different for everyone. That would make you second guess any pharmaceutical seeing as the same thing for everyone is how it is supposed to go, It may take you five weeks taking it each night until you get there. You may find you can do this after a week. Its NOTHING like smoking. There is suppository form as well if you do not want any high and you can take the 500 mgs right off the hop sorta say..  good luck with it...  its not a wonder drug but,,,,, I've personally seen it do some really amazing things for people from kids to adults alike!

995370,GbayGiant,2017-02-24 05:26:00,1780,"may be anecdotal but.  IN JANUARY 2011, then-14-year-old Alysa Erwin began having intense, debilitating headaches. By that spring she was diagnosed with Grade 3 Anaplastic Astrocytoma — brain cancer — at University of Michigan Medical Center. According to information at mdguidelines.com, “Individuals with grade 3 astrocytoma have a median survival time of 18 months with treatment (radiation and chemotherapy). … Even with aggressive treatment, astrocytomas of all types tend to recur, making the prognosis generally poor.” Alysa’s tumors were spread throughout her brain like ivy or a spider web. There was no local tumor that could be targeted for radiation. The Erwins, including Alysa’s parents Carly and David, returned to their northern Lower Peninsula home with five days worth of Temedor, an oral chemotherapy pill, to begin treatment. “We were told she could live 18 months to two years on chemo,” says Carly. “We thought that was a death sentence to her.” Still, seemingly without options, the Erwins figured they would give the chemotherapy a try. “She was deathly sick,” says Carly of her daughter after taking the Temedor. Carly was bedridden with terrible headaches and couldn’t keep food down. The Erwins were devastated. A few days later they got a call from Carly’s father, who lives in southeastern Michigan, saying he’d recently gone to a meeting with the group now known as Michigan Compassion and heard about Rick Simpson Hemp Oil, a cannabis extract that some people are using to treat cancer. The Erwins then watched the videos “What If Cannabis Cured Cancer” and “Run from the Cure,” both available on YouTube. “This is the end, we thought,” says Carly. “If this is all that chemo can do, at least we can make her comfortable for the months that she had left with us.” At first, the Erwins couldn’t find cannabis oil. Eventually they met Gersh Avery in the Ann Arbor area, who facilitated the Erwins in finding what they needed. In early August 2011, Alysa had her first dose of oil. Carly mixed about eight milliliters of cannabis oil with about a half-cup of peanut butter. She gave her daughter about a half-teaspoon, once in the morning and again in the evening. After the very first dose there was a miraculous transformation in the sick girl. “About 30 minutes after taking cannabis oil she was out of her room eating and smiling,” says Carly. “We knew what we wanted after seeing her, but we wanted to see what she wanted because it was her body. The light was back in her eyes again. She was back to herself. She said she wasn’t doing chemo anymore; she was only doing cannabis oil.” Starting out, Alysa slept a lot as her body became accustomed to the high levels of cannabinoids in her body. And, as she was able to tolerate it, her mother upped the dosage until Alysa was getting about one-and-a-half milliliters a day for a year, then upped it to three milliliters each day. At first they didn’t tell Alysa’s doctor. They were afraid and unsure of the legal implications. At her first three-month checkup, the MRI showed that the cancer was not growing. The Erwins told her doctor that Alysa was doing the chemo. The subsequent exam showed the same result, but the doctor had questions because Alysa’s blood work was not showing the indications expected of someone on chemotherapy. The Erwins admitted then that they had stopped the chemo in favor of cannabis oil. The doctor’s response was cautious because cannabis oil is not a condoned treatment. But she said, “Whatever you are doing, keep doing it.” After a year, the cancer had evolved into five identifiable tumors at the back of Alyssa’s head. One of the tumors was near her brain stem and threatened her ability to breathe and walk. The Erwins agreed to have radiation treatment. “After six weeks, I wished we’d never done it,” says Carly. “Her brain started swelling.” They continued the cannabis oil treatments. In January 2013, two years after the onset of her headaches, Alyssa’s MRI showed no cancer. Subsequent MRIs, the most recent in October, have shown no cancer. Her next scheduled test is in April. “The doctor looked at the MRI and she just smiled,” says Carly. There were a lot of smiles going around. During this time it was usually a scramble to get cannabis oil. According to information available on the Internet from Rick Simpson, one pound of high-grade marijuana produces about 60 milliliters of oil; at one-and-a-half milliliters each day, a pound would last only 40 days. And with the cost of a pound of good quality marijuana somewhere north of $3,000, you can see the problems. With help from Carly’s father, the Erwins have spent about $17,000 on cannabis oil medicine. Some of what they got was donated to them. Avery, from Ann Arbor, helped the Erwins find a good strain and advice on how to produce oil. Today, Alysa lives a pretty much typical teenage life, except she takes cannabis oil. She took driver’s training and passed her licensing test during this period with no problems. “I didn’t really know anything about it,” says Alysa. “I started watching videos and seeing other people’s stories. I thought I should try it. I was excited to try it. I didn’t want to do that chemo anymore because of the way it was making me feel. I think I would have gave up if I had to keep doing that chemo.” In the past year, she has started speaking publicly in support of the therapy that saved her life. “I’m trying to spread the word around what this medicine can do; what it can help,” says Alysa. “The last time I spoke, it was trying to fight for the oil. I’m trying to help people out to get a second chance like I got. I know my family was really scared. I was too. Once I found out about this oil it just gave me hope. That’s what gave me hope for this cancer being gone. I like to let other families know that so they can have that kind of hope.” In a few weeks, Alysa Erwin will have been officially cancer-free for one year. It will have been more than 36 months since her 18-month death sentence. She continues her cannabis oil treatments. Need I say more? Note: A previous version of this article said that Alysa was 4. She was 14.  Heres is another with the same.  good info        imagine what 60 years of research instead of prohibition, would have seen"
