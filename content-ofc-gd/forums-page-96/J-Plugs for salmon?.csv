1000466,John Bacon,2017-04-15 17:20:00,3277,I know that Lymans are popular on Georgian Bay and some people use them on Lake Ontario too.Has anybody had much success with J-Plugs for salmon and trout on Lake Ontario?
1000467,GbayGiant,2017-04-15 17:22:00,1780,"J plugs were around before lymans.. used on the west coarst where most of our baits for salmon come from. Custom colors work well!  but fire tiger...white ladder back and anything blue or purple and silver works well depending on the time of year, size helps as well."
1000472,Gallie,2017-04-15 18:21:00,1215,We use j plugs as well as lymans with similar success rates.

Is this what you mean by white ladder back?    "

1000600,Pikeslayer,2017-04-17 00:04:00,1443,"Lymans are my ""almost always gets something"" go to. Glow white ladder back dawn & dusk, fire tiger when the suns up. Always on the 'guest rod' 10 colour core"
1000610,Gallie,2017-04-17 00:41:00,1215,"I guess i could have mentioned colours, our best 2 were green with black ladderback and blue with black ladderback, orange belly usually out performed white belly though. I usually ran one lyman/jplug on my middle dipsey and you never know what would hit it."
