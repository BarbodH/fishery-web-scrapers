Lots of nice scenery, fish, and some cool underwater shots:      Also did a short cabin tour video. It's included in the long video, but again wanted to make sure it doesn't get lost in the shuffle.      Hope you enjoy,   Cheers,  Mike"

858605,solopaddler,2014-06-15 22:11:00,8605,"Thanks guys. I'm really not a pro when it comes to video in fact my 10 year old daughter can do better. I'm still learning how to use this program and I know there's a few glaring errors with the soundtrack and some of the title pages.  I'll learn quick though, the videos will only get better."

Nice one in the cradle!I guess it doesn't get that big by being a fussy eater!!  Video quality is fine---I don't know how you manage it at all and still play that guitar!!
