1000871,Shloim,2017-04-18 18:54:00,515,"Hi folks, was thinking of adding IPilot to my Powerdrive V2 and noticed that I lose my foot peddle?.... But I don't wanna lose my foot peddle..... There is apparently a cordless foot peddle is there not? Thoughts on this as remote only control is not gonna fly!"
1000883,BillM,2017-04-18 19:45:00,17367,That's the problem with adding iPilot to the Powerdrive units.   It sucks that you lose the pedal control.
1000890,Sinker,2017-04-18 20:26:00,8692,Sucks bad. I'd put it on mine in a heartbeat if could still use the foot pedal. I can't stand the hand controlled remote.  S.
1000935,iFish4real,2017-04-19 00:25:00,386,"Just take a while to get used to it. I like mine. Gives you control from anywhere in the boat, even from shore )"
1000937,limeyangler,2017-04-19 00:34:00,5204,"Just take a while to get used to it. I like mine. Gives you control from anywhere in the boat, even from shore )    I'm with ^^^^^^^  Way easier with the remote, remember, with the gps autopilot ( if your unit was not auto pilot before) you hardly have to make any adjustments as the motor holds you on a heading, unlike motors without that which if left alone will steer you in a circle, I set my heading and every now and again press left or right, I use the spot lock more often than I do steering, hell you can even set the speed you want with cruise control and it compensates for wind and current on the go....and I can move around the boat at will without worrying about where i'm going, just concentrate on my FISHING...foot pedal?????.......MEH!"
1000974,Shloim,2017-04-19 10:30:00,515,Well I'm still just as confused. Except now I guess I can start getting my head around it. The pros outweigh the cons on this one I think.... plus a buddy in the biz just just told me I can hook a unit up and try it out for a couple weeks as long as I can return it perfectly packaged.Hard to say no there....
1000980,Hoppy,2017-04-19 12:05:00,95,I got both with my terra nova but have never even tried the foot pedal. I don't think you'll miss it. Embrace the remote.  Have fun with the new toy.
1001052,G.mech,2017-04-19 19:20:00,830,I put the Autopilot on a Powerdrive V2 a few years ago and never ever missed the footpedal.   I've had 2 terrovas since and the footpedals have never been plugged in.  You'll find you don't need to adjust hardly at all if you use the Autopilot mode.
1001066,bare foot wader,2017-04-19 20:54:00,1354,"so after the ipilot upgrade on the pd v2 units, you can't upgrade to the ipilot foot pedal for it, not a compatible plug in? or we're saying only the old v2 pedal is no longer compatible after the upgrade?  I started out with the terrova, so this is news to me but will pass it along to buddy who is talking about upgrading....imo I need both the foot pedal and the remote, I could never give up the foot pedal entirely, just depends on the style of fishing any given day....days where I'm primarily casting out of the bow, I prefer to use the foot pedal still"
1001074,aplumma,2017-04-19 21:19:00,6896,I run a motor guide with a hand fob and foot pedal. I have the foot pedal up front to use while I am fishing and anchor lock. The hand fob is for the person in the rear of the boat to use when I am distracted. It works out well I could lose the foot pedal easily and just use 2 fobs.  Art
1001075,G.mech,2017-04-19 21:22:00,830,"Unless something has changed in the last couple of years, once you put the i-Pilot or the Co-pilot wireless on the Powerdrive units, you lose the ability to plug in a foot pedal.  You can use both on the Terrova's."
1001288,Mister G,2017-04-20 22:05:00,1429,"Sucks bad. I'd put it on mine in a heartbeat if could still use the foot pedal. I can't stand the hand controlled remote.  S. Trust me Sinker, I know how you fish and you will NEVER miss the foot pedal and embrace the i-Pilot."
1001325,Sinker,2017-04-21 01:36:00,8692,I have used ipilot many times and cant stand no foot pedal. Its like a bad habit i cant break.  S.
1001496,206,2017-04-23 02:08:00,563,those foot pedals for the powerdrive are junk anyway...got 3 in the garage only one may work lol  I love the ipilot remote is a lil large for my liking but works like a charm
