Last fall I purchased a new Abu Garcia Revo spinning reel and needless to say I was ultra excited to use my first $100+ reel set up.  Having fished my entire life with ultra cheap gear, to have a decent qualtity name brand reel was a treat.  First day on the water, i take a cast and immediately I can just tell, something isnt quiet right...  Go figure, I go and finally spend a decent amount of money on a reel and it doesn't work quiet right.  I begin to wonder, is it all in my head, or is the very very slight clicking, and stiff points in my reeling actually happening. I fish the entire fall, and spring, i take the reel apart and can see no problems, to make matters worse, when i take the reel off of the rod, theres hardly any noticeable problem at all. I must be going crazy  Finally after much self speculation, i call Rocky's tackle and they tell em to send my reel in. Off it goes...  The weekend while my reel is gone, i head to the kawarthas to do some bass fishing with friends, and my friend is nice enough to lend me 2 of his set ups. The first reel I use feels buttery smooth, and i start to feel a bit better about myself, because maybe not all reels have a slight click and drag and in them, but then i pick up rod 2 and my confidence is totally wavered as his second reel seems to have the exact same feel as mine  After fishing all weekend I return to work, and my reel returns, I unpackage the reel and rocky's notes that they have replaced the gearing and greased the reel. Off the rod the reel feels the same...a torturous week ensues with my self doubt growing every higher, until finally i arrive at the cottage on Friday evening, I cant even wait to get set up, I ditch my stuff in the car and run down to the lake to try out my fixed reel....   Its the smoothest reel I have personally ever used....maybe I am not crazy afterall?  "
