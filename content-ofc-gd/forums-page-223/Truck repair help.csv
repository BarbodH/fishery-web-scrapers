864095,mike rousseau,2014-07-21 16:38:00,4661,Good afternoon  So... 2005 F150 FX4 5.4L  So I have a clicking sound in my front end... Passenger side...  It has a metallic sound to it...  A while back my passenger brake stuck and everything got burning hot...  I got underneath and nothing felt loose or anything...  The sound got stringer and more uniform in 4x4  Any thoughts?
864098,ecmilley,2014-07-21 16:43:00,2163,Brake or wheel bearing. Seen lots and lots of f150 seize brakes and loose frt bearings
864101,mike rousseau,2014-07-21 17:19:00,4661, Ok... That's not so bad..  I took the brakes apart and filed where the tin slides go... I didn't know I had to do this when I did the brakes... So they aren't sticking anymore...    Also I forgot to mention my ABS light and e brake light are staying on... I changed my e brake shoes and hardware today... And as far as I know the ABS sensor is in the bearing assembly... So bearing is making sense...
864102,aplumma,2014-07-21 17:40:00,6896,Sorry to hear this Mike. Maybe Bernie will chime in with a little wisdom also.   Art
864127,fishnsled,2014-07-21 20:25:00,3520,Could be as simple as the cheap chrome plating on the rims peeling off and rubbing on brakes.  I've had that on mine.
864135,davey buoy,2014-07-21 21:26:00,5505,"I'm thinking bearing,as that is what the ABS reads off."
864138,outllaw,2014-07-21 21:43:00,1232,caliper seize?
864143,ecmilley,2014-07-21 22:35:00,2163,"Lift the offending wheel give a spin and check for play. Usually the later fords its a rotor assembly but the there is aftermarket bearing only available. Any q, s dont hesitate to ask"
865412,mike rousseau,2014-07-29 14:26:00,4661,Ok  So bearing assembly changed....  My vibrations at 70+km/h are gone...  But the clicking sound is still there...  And e brake and ABS lights are still on...  I only hear the clicking when driving under 20km/h...  I was also able to hear the clicking when I spun my front passenger wheel when it was still lifted....  Any thoughts...?  Disregard... Vibration still there
865439,DOS,2014-07-29 15:44:00,119,cv shaft u joint.  you said its worse with the 4x4 engaged?  That aint cheap
865442,ecmilley,2014-07-29 16:08:00,2163,As guess bent/damaged brake clip
865443,ecmilley,2014-07-29 16:09:00,2163,Make sure the tone ring isnt damaged on shaft
865449,mike rousseau,2014-07-29 16:52:00,4661,  Definitely getting above my knowledge of trucks here...  Not sure exactly what that is either...  I can get complete cv axles for $80 rack and from what I saw on YouTube I can replace them myself...   That being said the cv shaft looks ok... Boots look fine...
865468,mike rousseau,2014-07-29 17:39:00,4661,Just noticed this... I'm not sure if this is related to the sound but now I have another part to get fixed... Leak where the driveshaft connects to the differential...  
865469,mike rousseau,2014-07-29 18:02:00,4661,Checked oil level and it seams fine
865478,jimmer,2014-07-29 19:54:00,2730,"There are some seals and bearing in the front of your differential that can go. I just replaced my rear end on a Ranger for $300, which was much less than the garage wanted to charge me. A minimum of $1500, but I know it would have been more when they got into brakes. So rear brakes and a diff from the wreckers all for less than $500. Car repairs can drive you nuts! I feel for you."
865497,ecmilley,2014-07-29 21:56:00,2163,Put vehicle in 4 wd lift wheel see if it spins if it does broken axle. Make sure hub engages little vac line there
865500,Bernie,2014-07-29 23:03:00,3190,"The hubs disengage with vacuum applied.If vacuum fails it defaults to lock, just in case you rip off the hose in the bush.The noise could be a bad lock too. The leak at the diff is called a pinion seal. It will need to be replaced. "
865501,Bernie,2014-07-29 23:14:00,3190,"If the red brake lamp is staying lit, check the brake fluid level.If low, this can turn on that light. If level is OK and the park brake pedal is fully retracted the fluid level switch in the master cylinder may be stuck down or has a bad switch (It's a magnetic switch)."
865538,mike rousseau,2014-07-30 04:36:00,4661,I'll try that tomorrow  Thanks again
865539,mike rousseau,2014-07-30 04:39:00,4661,I checked and it looked fine  I'll double check and top up of needed...  Thank you so much everyone for the help...  I'm learning a lot between you guys and YouTube...
