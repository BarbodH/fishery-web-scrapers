864697,Sour_Squirrel,2014-07-25 16:51:00,196,Here's a video I took of myself catching a Smallmouth Bass on Lake of Bays.  It's not a big fish but was still fun catching him while on a kayak with a 6' light action rod. To be honest I can't remember how I managed to shoot the video (using my iPhone) while at the same time reeling in the fish(!!).
