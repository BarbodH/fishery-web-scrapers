858285,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-14 03:43:00,10439,Pollen SUCKS!!!! I spent the better part of my trip to FLA this spring inside due to the worst allergies I have ever experienced. â€‹Luckily my allergies are non existent up North of 60* it seems. They were pretty bad in the GTA @ this time of year before I got out of Dodge!!
858438,Raf,2014-06-15 01:07:00,3495,"""they""'re saying this is the worst year in a long time for allergy suffers.  i am not normally affected but this year i've some symptoms."
858465,Paudash,2014-06-15 03:31:00,273,looked like it was snowing at one point today with all the white stuff blowing off the trees
858473,grimsbylander,2014-06-15 04:03:00,3016,Yeah it seems to be worse this year. My truck is yellow and my eyes are red. I try to survive without antihistamines but I may have to resort to using them.
858488,fishindevil,2014-06-15 09:35:00,6254,It's in the lakes too !!!! Some lakes in Haliburton are green !!!! Lots of pollen floating in the water and you get a nice dirty scum line on your boat and trailer !!!! And yes I have had watery eyes and sore throat too !!! You can taste & smell the pollen in the air too !!!!

Here's what to do folks: head to your nearest pharmacy, go to the counter (not available on shelves), and ask for Novo Pheniram. You won't find a better antihistamine. And it isn't expensive."
858566,Ralph Field,2014-06-15 19:18:00,1018,No wonder my eyes are swollen.

When I saw the post about allergies it reminded me about this one. I mentioned ^this^ to my sister in law and she said it was the best thing she'd ever tried. Not sure if it works the same for everyone, but Dave, my sil thinks you are a genius."
865070,BillM,2014-07-27 23:09:00,17367,No yellow stuff around my area yet..  Although I'm sure it will be any day.
