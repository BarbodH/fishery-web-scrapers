BUT , I don't have time to look and what I want to know is there a way to download a Netflix or Youtube etc video and save it to maybe watch it at the cottage or the next day or week etc. and how much is the devise and how much can the devise store?  Also I want to know what connections you need. if you can hook it to HDMI ,RCA etc."
865613,BillM,2014-07-30 18:37:00,17367,Saving Netflix or Youtube vids to watch at a later date requires you to re-record and capture the video again.
865614,Raf,2014-07-30 18:39:00,3495,"ps3 browser wont work.  it's very outdated.  plug-in through HDMI, one of these android devices (what we use) or some people use chromecast? for stuff life projectfreetv.  live sports can still be hit and miss for cable cutters (it is improving though). if you have no desire to frack around in order to watch them, a $ubscription may be the way to go (I get NHL Gamecenter which I can watch on the PS3, WDTV or any PC/Mobile Device).  If you are into multiple sports, this could potentailly chew into any savings you achieved by cutting cable significantly."
865617,JoshS,2014-07-30 18:52:00,729,"Thanks. I throw on the odd jays game on and mainly concerned about catching leafs games. I'll look into gamecenter.  I just looked up chromecast and looks pretty good... I'm going to look into this further. Or might just go hdmi route.  I'm thinking digital rabit ears might be worth it too to get a few basic channels, catch the live news etc and sat night cbc games."
865618,Raf,2014-07-30 18:54:00,3495,"an OTA antenna will work decently for live sports if you're close to the cn tower (CBC/CTV/Global). not sure where Jays games are broadcast these days but you have HNIC covered.  hint: if you 'trick' nhl gamecenter into thinking you're from outside north america, the subscription is $99 / year.  you will need the same to get around blackouts related to region."
865621,JoshS,2014-07-30 19:06:00,729,"I will definietly go that route if I get gamecenter. Appreciate the tips, gotta get a few things sorted being a new cable cutter.

I use my WDTV live and can pause, stop, go back later, whatever I want to do. My computer isn't connected directly to my TV except through the WDTV wirelessly (didn't want a cable running across the floor) and if there is a TV show that I want to watch I just down load it using KAT, run it through VUZE and play it on my TV. I get HD or whatever it was broadcast in which is perfect for me.  Again it is as good as having it on a DVD and when I am done with it, a couple of keystrokes and it is gone or if I want, I can burn it to DVD or a memory stick and take it up to the kids with me easy as drag and drop.

I also might watch something in pieces or if it is good or I am trying to figure something out watch it a couple times and chewing up my download limit on the same thing...  Most of the reason I haven't used more video was our download speed at home and with work needing most of the bandwidth and we just switched to Techsavy.  I haven't had time to look into the options and packages and how it works and thought the netflix topic was a good place to ask rather than trying to sort some of the hype from reality.

I use Vuze (find it very easy to navigate I'm a little computarded). Download torrents from piratebay or kickasstorrents. With a 80 gig limit I never go over and I do grab most of my movies in hd.

865570,Consigliere,2014-07-30 12:54:00,121,"Roku is absolutely the way to go.  Do not get a WD LIVE.  Roku is very likely to be the operating system of the future for the majority of TVs.  It is amazing and with some time and effort you can essentially get all sports, TV and movies for free.  There is some out front money to do this but it is possible.  Google the Plex App and IceFilms, SS Plex unsupported apps.  The 109 is for Roku 3 which the only feature really is that you can plug in a USB stick to it and hard wire it to your LAN.  Roku 2 has same functionality except Wifi only and no USB port.  I have both a 2 and a 3 and really should've just got two Roku 2."

The same cannot be said for the others.  If you are tech savvy, have the time to fiddle around with it, buy/configure additional software/hardware ie. Plex Server, yes the others may have a leg up.

You can simply try it from your computer first.  Why spend $100+ and find out Netflix doesn't cut it for you?  Also, you can get free movies etc.. using the aforementioned methods, but it should be made clear that doing so is not legal for the most part."
865593,mepps,2014-07-30 16:39:00,1301,"I've been without cable TV for almost 10 years now and have no regrets. Most of our shows are watched out Netflix or Hulu. I'm using another service that is $5 a month more to get the US version of Netflix, and free version of Hulu which offers a ton of new content weekly.  I've never used AppleTV or WDLive, but I have my computer hooked up right to my TV and a small Android PC that plays just about anything you Android phone will play on your TV screen (with exception of Hulu Free). Its a bit clumsy, but very user friendly if you already have an Android phone.  As far as bandwith, not all Netflix media will stream at the highest HD, and I think there may even be an option to user lower quality, but I'll have to double check that when I'm home. But as everyone has said, 30gb is likely too little."

If you are willing to do a bit of work and use your computer then by far Roku exceeds all other devices and it's not even close.  If you want to take it out of the box, plug it in, use it for Netflix etc then they are all equally capable of that and have different functionality.  I can not say enough that if you are willing to use your PC as well you can get every TV show immediately after it airs for free, all live sports from the 4 major NA leagues you absolutely need a Roku...WD Live is the weakest by far in that area and Apple TV is in between."

We have Bell FIBE internet with unlimited bandwidth for $82 taxes in per month, Netflix for $8, and run it all from our laptop thru HDMI cable to our 50"" plasma  Anything you can't find to watch on Netflix can be found on projectfreetv.com, as long as you have good anti virus and some patience to find a working link lol.

864959,Canuck2fan,2014-07-27 14:57:00,1444,"30GB as a limit won't work with Netflix... Your overage charges will kill any savings. If you do want to use Netflix you would have to increase your limit, by switching providers or using another offer from one to get Bell to raise your limit with them. Not sure what options you have around you but getting a decent cable connection with 200-300 GB shouldn't cost more than 55.00 a month including taxes. So if you can cancel or reduce your cable package to get a higher GB limit and Netflix for the same money you are paying then it makes sense.  I started using freephone.ca for voip last August and got rid of my phone bill totally after paying 130.00 to set it up. I then dropped my Satellite package to the lowest one Shaw offers, but increased my internet to use the voip and d/l anything I want to watch that isn't on Shaw. So I went from paying 28.00 for home phone, 44.00 for internet and 67.00 for satellite. To 41.00 for shaw (which I am going to cancel next month, as there just isn't anything worth watching on the minimum package anymore) and 51.00 for internet....  For the longest time I just paid the bills when they came in and didn't really look at if I was getting any real value for the money. Then I got my hours cut at work and so I started to really examine where my money was going. I was paying over 1668.00 a year and will have cut it to 612.00 for a year next month with no real change except I have to pick and choose the media I want to watch."

864991,adempsey,2014-07-27 16:15:00,1498,"I was considering doing the Netflix switch myself.    However, I would definitely upgrade my internet bandwidth to unlimited.    More for peace of mind than anything.   I am with Teksavvy as well, and going from 300G to Unlimited is an additional $20/month for me.  So, I'd still save $40+ by cancelling my satellite TV after subscribing to Netflix and upgrading my internet connection.  However, I'd recommend testing it out first.  I am sure they still have those 30 day trials.   I say this because when it first came to Canada I went with a 30 day trial.   I don't know why, but the quality was just horrible.   It was worse than watching a VHS video tape.   Maybe it was just my settings, I don't know.  I just assumed Rogers was throttling me and Netflix set me at the lowest quality because of it.   What I've seen at other peoples homes is far superior though.  HD quality.  Couple of points with Netflix though.  When you subscribe, you get something like five accounts.   So, I've had multiple people offer me free accounts.  What you get on Netflix in Canada differs than what is in the UK and USA.  However, there are ways to get all three if you are inclined to do so.  It might be worth checking out Apple TV and the Roku media devices as well.   You don't need them since almost every device has Netflix on it these days.   However, they offer other streaming services that make switching from cable/satellite much more appealing.  However, some of it is not for the non-techy since it's still early days and can be buggy."

There are a few good series; House of Cards, Covert Affairs but after last winter we had watched almost everything right up to date that we were interested in. We hardly ever turn it on anymore."

Be a good way to utilize the unit as it hasn't been used in over two years . Thanks again for all your comments,been quite helpful."

A simple DNS change will get you the US content."

Unless you can tell me to ""Click here"" and give it to me step by step I have no idea what I am doing LOL. Don't even know what DNS stands for ""well maybe"" Do Not Surender?  Actually I think we have the US content, my son set it up for me. We do use the Wii but we also have a WDTV Live unit and I just use it. I find it easier."
865058,mosquito,2014-07-27 22:45:00,111,"TechSavvy cable is one I would recommend. 30G isn't enough, with working from home (remote desktops..) , youtube, daughter streaming music and a few other items WITHOUT netflix we can occasionally go over 150Gb.  I would also suggest you look at the shows you want, there are companies where you can purchase a proxy from for less than $50 a year and you can set it so it looks like you are in the US, the UK or any other country you want.  I don't have Netflix but was thinking I might in the fall and when I looked into it one of the criticisms was that the Canadian selection isn't as large as the US or UK.  By setting up a proxy you can setup the UK or US. My brother in law turned off the cable completely and uses a free to air (think the old rabbit ears... but now it is digital) to watch a couple of the local channels (you can get an indoor antennae for about $25) and the rest on the computer.  This one article you can check out but I see the links to ""free tv"" in the related articles list. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/gadgets-and-gear/gadgets/roku-streaming-tv-box-a-new-option-for-canadas-cable-haters/article4103183/"

865066,porkpie,2014-07-27 22:56:00,2521,New customer.  I had just dumped Rogers for everything including my cell phones.  I called Ma Bell to order a landline (wife's insistence) and was going with teksavvy for internet and was going to use the internet for television etc.  Bell came up with a deal for 2 years that I couldn't beat and included unlimited internet. They tried to screw me about 4 months into it ( of course) but I had written everything down including names of those I had talked to etc. in anticipation of that (dealt with Rogers and bell way to many times in the past) and they had no choice but to honour the deal.
865109,Raf,2014-07-28 01:42:00,3495,"We use adfreetime.  1.99 / month -- for the cost of an extra large double double, I don't have to worry about the free ones going down and the aggravation of finding a new one.  I'm worth more than 2 bucks for 5 minutes. LOL  In addition to Netflix region picker, it also lets me get around the NHL Gamecenter blackouts and stream Pandora   There's a host of other services they support but we dont use them."
