863940,grimsbylander,2014-07-20 16:23:00,3016,I just bought a NOCO Genius 4-bank onboard charger and a plug adaptor for 50% off.  http://www.geniuschargers.com/  Promo code = SJS50  Crazy good deal.
863944,Terry,2014-07-20 16:49:00,14456,"@ 1.1 amp per bank I would have no use for it, it would take 3 or 4 days to recharge my deep cycle batteries  but if you had 4 batteries stored for the winter it would maintain them"
863948,fishnsled,2014-07-20 17:06:00,3520,"@ 1.1 amp per bank I would have no use for it, it would take 3 or 4 days to recharge my deep cycle batteries  but if you had 4 batteries stored for the winter it would maintain them  If your click on the marine tab at the top of the page there are several models to choose from up to a 4 bank 40Amp (10 per bank) charger.  Not that I need one but the promo code worked on that.  Good deal it seems."
863949,Terry,2014-07-20 17:12:00,14456,oh yeah those ones would work fine then  never mind ...lol yeah just checked and the 3 bank one is a great deal

863971,d_paluch,2014-07-20 18:35:00,343,"damn great deal  no real need for this, but at 50% off its hard to say no!"
863972,d_paluch,2014-07-20 18:38:00,343,going to pick up the gen2 mini.  At $65.....
863977,d_paluch,2014-07-20 18:53:00,343,"24.95 shipping to canada, but still a damn good deal"
863994,grimsbylander,2014-07-20 20:01:00,3016,I don't know what I'm more excited about...the charger or the handy adaptor so I don't have to open the back compartment just to plug in the batteries!!!

864034,grimsbylander,2014-07-21 01:02:00,3016, Haha picked that up too!  
864787,porkpie,2014-07-26 02:59:00,2521,"FYI canadian tire has the NOCO chargers on sale this week.  $92 for the 2 bank charger.  About the same as buying it down south with shipping and exchange rate, plus you can have it in your hand."
864790,Dan668,2014-07-26 03:17:00,1120,"I don't use this charger, but a few friends own them, no issues. Pretty cheap price for what your getting. Solid deal."
864793,grimsbylander,2014-07-26 03:24:00,3016,You need to read the specs on that deal. Its the mini 4amp per bank charger. Not a great everyday charger. Noco's 10 amp charger in a 2 bank is $216US. The more you spend the more you'll save. And living close to the border helps!
864798,porkpie,2014-07-26 04:00:00,2521,"Fair enough pal, I just noticed it and passed on the info. I'm not buying myself, and didn't look into the fine details!"
864803,d_paluch,2014-07-26 08:50:00,343,"But, plug in the 4amp/bank charger 2 nights before fishing and you should be good to go, right?  I usually use my current regular charger @ 10amp and it charges in less than a night no problem. By the way, mine came in the mail. Looks and feels like a solid unit. Going to install it later this week."
864806,grimsbylander,2014-07-26 10:34:00,3016,Did you get charged any duty or taxes?

I use the 2 bank 4 amp Noco mini charger and .after fishing the strong currents of the upper Niagara river for 7-8hrs my batteries r fully charged in less than 7hrs."
864817,mattp33,2014-07-26 13:21:00,290,code no worky anymore
864826,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-26 14:37:00,10439,code no worky anymore  Yeah I noticed that last night.
864847,mattp33,2014-07-26 17:32:00,290,can tire does have the 4 bank but its $$$  And I'm not sure if its ok for marine use?
864910,d_paluch,2014-07-27 02:18:00,343,no duties or taxes charged  can't wait to install it this week
864916,Wagoneer,2014-07-27 06:12:00,118,"Not a huge fan of the Noco chargers. They seem to cut out a little early before the battery is fully charged. The cut-off is set a little bit too far on the safe side. Not a huge deal if you're using it for a maintainer or using it on something that has an altenator, but it made a significant difference on the run-time for my trolling motor. They are nice to charge up a completely dead battery though. I really only use mine for that anymore.  I have two battery tender juniors - 0.75A. One is constantly hooked up to my deep cycle and the other to my motorcycle. Both are ready to go whenever I need them. After I discharge the deep cycle after a trip I use the Noco to bring it back and then use the junior to top it off."
