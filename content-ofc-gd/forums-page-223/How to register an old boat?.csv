865782,Entropy,2014-07-31 17:39:00,747,"I have an old boat with a 'plate' on the stern that has a number and max hp rating on it.  It is very old, was given to me from a friend years ago, but I now have a 15 hp motor on it.  How do I register it?  I couldn't 'google' up a quick page for it.  Any Help?  Entropy"
