864520,Bernie,2014-07-23 23:53:00,3190,"Last April FisherPete posted he had an old engine for sale, a 1955 25 HP Johnson. We swung a deal and the guys brought it up in May.I puttered with it once in a while since then. I noticed it had new ignition wires so I didn't bother to check the coils.The powerhead doesn't appear to ever been apart and it has good compression.The lower unit has been apart because the skeg is off of something newer. Checked the gear oil, no water, good sign.So I threw it on the test tank at the shop, hooked up the dual line fuel tank and primed it up. Fuel leak appeared immediately at the glass fuel filter. Pulled it off, cleaned the crud out of it.At this point I am figuring a carb overhaul. It's an electric start, kind of rare for this era, so I hooked up a battery and cranked it over. It sputtered a little bit but failed. Lightly tapped the carb a few times to unstick the needle and seat, opened up both jets to allow any crud that may be blocking them.Crank again, yep, she fired up. Gave the jets a quick adjustment, checked for water pump flow. Let it idle on the tank for a few minutes.It runs a little clanky like most of these 25's did, but it's running on two cylinders. Some of the noise may be due to the hood rubber mounts missing.I loaded it up and brought it out to the cottage. Took my 18 off and plunked it on the transom. It's a lot heavier than my old 18, it was all I could do to carry the dang thing."
864525,Ralph Field,2014-07-24 00:16:00,1018,Great to see it restored instead of it being scrapped.
864526,Kerry,2014-07-24 00:17:00,383,Remember my old 18.First one I worked on.Pain in the butt pressure tanks but they run forever.Sounds great Bernie! Kerry
864527,John Bacon,2014-07-24 00:18:00,3277,"Looks like the exact same model that my dad had on his old cedar strip.  Ironically, his motor was also a replacement for an 18 horsepower."
864533,Big Cliff,2014-07-24 00:35:00,6899,Oh that is so nice to hear! Great work Bernie!
864536,Handlebarz,2014-07-24 00:46:00,3790,Always nice to get some more life out of someone's scrap. I had 4 old motors I wanted to rebuild but after taking up floor space for a few years I found a new home for them I always wonder if they we brought back to life
864543,Joeytier,2014-07-24 01:45:00,3990,Very cool.  I just purchased a late 60's model Viking 6 hp that runs quite well but I wish I had your talents for when things start to go sour.  Maybe I'll make the drive south to powassan and pick yer brain
864550,Fisherpete,2014-07-24 02:53:00,1814,Awesome to hear Bernie!!! Glad she fired up without too much fussin.
864571,outllaw,2014-07-24 12:05:00,1232,"sweet were they 33-1 mix . if so I remember them days. mosquito,s were never an issue"
864581,Headhunter,2014-07-24 14:12:00,5703,Nicely done Bernie...now you just need another cedar strip boat so you have a boat for each motor! HH
864586,Bernie,2014-07-24 14:51:00,3190,"Nicely done Bernie...now you just need another cedar strip boat so you have a boat for each motor! HH  Where would Will park his? I'd have to build another dock.  Pete, any chance of the tiller handle for the engine be kicking around? I had to take one off of one of dads for the time being. "
864589,Fisherpete,2014-07-24 15:06:00,1814,"No, sorry Bernie, that's how it came when my dad bought the boat. Rigged up for the steering wheel."
864609,misfish,2014-07-24 18:44:00,29133,That thing really scoots along Bernie. NICE   BTW  You have deer on that island?
864613,pidge,2014-07-24 19:04:00,438,"Bloody hell that moves! I always had a soft spot for the old motors. The chrome, simplicity, paint etc. always like stopping by those guys from a club that set up shop at the sportsman show and such to show there restorations and such. Nice stuff."
864616,fishnsled,2014-07-24 19:12:00,3520," Where would Will park his? I'd have to build another dock.  Pete, any chance of the tiller handle for the engine be kicking around? I had to take one off of one of dads for the time being.   You might have to build another dock but I'd gladly lend a hand with that.     Nice to see the old girl running, she flies!!"
864620,davey buoy,2014-07-24 19:40:00,5505,"Nice motor,she sure moves along.Great find!!"
864658,Freshtrax,2014-07-25 01:17:00,2215,I need to finish my giesler resto. Pronto.
864659,Bernie,2014-07-25 01:27:00,3190,"Took it out for a good run this evening on calmer waters.Runs really well, and yes, it is quick. I'll GPS it to know for sure.It has a torque steer I'll need to address, it pulls pretty hard.This one is worthy for a paint restoration and new decals. It will be a good winter project."
864866,Big Cliff,2014-07-26 18:44:00,6899,"I'd be interested in hearing what you get on the GPS! Not that it is a factor, the fact that it runs so well just amazes me. What is that saying ""one mans garbage is another mans gold""?"
864870,Bernie,2014-07-26 19:15:00,3190,"Thanks for the reminder Cliff.Just went out and tried it. 24.5 average, not bad for an old clunker and a 16 ft wood boat."
864900,Big Cliff,2014-07-27 01:06:00,6899,Not Bad? That is fantastic!
