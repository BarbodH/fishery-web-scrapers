864964,cptpronin,2014-07-27 15:16:00,3,"Hi OFC,  Long time angler, forum newbie.  Good to meet you all!  I live in Halton and like to make the best of all the opportunities it offers.  From Lake Ontario to the Conservation areas and streams.  Just me, some waders, or my trusty inflatable.  That's the good life right there!  Like to take a fun, active, cheap, environmental approach to fishing and practice good conservation. A few shots from '14 so far, all from the Halton region.            "
