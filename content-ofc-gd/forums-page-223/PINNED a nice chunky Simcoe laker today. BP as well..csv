864843,misfish,2014-07-26 17:26:00,29133,"Seems Terry this year has been having all the luck  with the lakers. Ya I have caught a few. That two fish on one line is still my highlight of the season. Today,I decided to bring out old faithful and see if my luck would change.. THE PIN. Last year I was nailing them,so figured it couldnt hurt.   Well it didnt let me down. Marked a nice pod of fish,lower the ball to tick the bottom,raise two feet and we have lift off.   My biggest laker so far.  33 7/8 inches long.     This half peeled NK did the trick. I love this lure. I nailed abunch last year with pretty much the same thing. LOL     Some random shot from our outing.  Terrys new toy. Vision down rigger camera thingy ..             "

865119,Joeytier,2014-07-28 02:28:00,3990,Looks like a blast.  Are you running your river rod for the rigger?
