865451,misfish,2014-07-29 17:04:00,29133,"LOL  Only if I had an electric motor on my toon too. Aint happening though. I,ll get out there on my natural power.     Added some safety flags to our toons . Also added  rod holders to mine. For today I just strapped my finder on,but have a ram mount I made for it. Will have that set up for the next outing.        Crazy bugger was gone but I could still see him. Barely.   That little dot out there is Terry. HEY,WAIT FOR ME,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,     Hows the fishing out there?????????/ What? I cant hear you.       Smallie,s seem to have moved out. Managed three in the short time we were out there. All on spinner baits.     HAVING FUN"
865458,Terry,2014-07-29 17:15:00,14456,"hey I was on my way out to jig for lakers, but it got to windy out there,  found a bunch of fine perch and big pan fish            "
865459,misfish,2014-07-29 17:19:00,29133,Me thinks thats a scud in the first pic. Nice. Got a few of them sunfish too. Perch were in huge numbers again.
865460,BillM,2014-07-29 17:21:00,17367,"Terry, nice looking bluegill."
865461,misfish,2014-07-29 17:23:00,29133,"Terry, nice looking bluegill.  Yes you would be correct Bill. Missed that little dot on the side."
865462,crappieperchhunter,2014-07-29 17:30:00,2582,Killing me with the perch pics Terry. Haven't had a feed of Simcoe candy since April
865471,misfish,2014-07-29 18:06:00,29133,"Steve  Where we launch mostly with the toons,there is no boat launch near us. We look for access spots and a place to park the car and truck. If you want a feed and willing to fish with us,your going to need a toon.LOL  This to me,is the best thing about our float boats."
865472,highdrifter,2014-07-29 18:15:00,2534,My my my Terry...  You have some nice toys..
865495,Rod Caster,2014-07-29 21:51:00,5784,Man those things look like fun!
865523,Nipfisher,2014-07-30 01:17:00,2449,Never used that toon once Chad. Wait 'till you see my fishing Yak.

Too busy chasing gills and crappie up in Caygeon at the cottage. But I do miss my Simcoe perch as they are my favorite fish to eat. I just have to be patient and wait until the fall.  Those toons look like alot of fun. I could seriously see myself with one someday. I already have at least a dozen spots where I could launch one and enjoy some quality fishing."
865600,Rod Caster,2014-07-30 17:24:00,5784,Never used that toon once Chad. Wait 'till you see my fishing Yak. I know some rivers where that Yak would be prime!
865606,TJQ,2014-07-30 18:17:00,7806,That is a sweet setup!!
865664,colin519,2014-07-30 22:21:00,101,best part of those is that they float even when you flip them. how durable are the outside of the pontoons? are they susceptible to hooks?
865666,Terry,2014-07-30 22:26:00,14456,there is an outer shell the zips over the air bladder to protect it so there is some protection but if a hooked fish caught it and kept wiggling   it could be bad
865669,misfish,2014-07-30 22:47:00,29133,  Thats why I stay close to shore. Not going 4 miles out.
865671,Terry,2014-07-30 22:59:00,14456,yeah when I was jigging lake trout today I was trying to figure out just how to release them without getting close to the tubes  well did not get to try I did have some fish flying up to hit my jig but just wouldn't commit
865674,misfish,2014-07-30 23:12:00,29133,Just dont forget the title of this thread.
