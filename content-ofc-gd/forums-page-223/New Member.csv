865207,Joeytier,2014-07-28 16:58:00,3990,"Welcome to the board.  I just watched a good portion of your Onaping video...very cool.  Just a tip though, holding your rod 3/4 up the blank while i a pike is thrashing around on a tight line is a great way to break a rod, and yes, I am speaking from experience"

865416,Will-Fish,2014-07-29 14:30:00,31,Welcome to the board. I am pretty new too. Nice boat. Can you share some info on your legend boat. Looking to get one myself. Thanks
865446,thegrumpyfisherman,2014-07-29 16:26:00,59,"Welcome to the board. I am pretty new too. Nice boat. Can you share some info on your legend boat. Looking to get one myself. Thanks  Sure Will and thanks!  It's a two year old ProSport 14 footer I bought new.  It of course has an aerated live well, 25 hp 4-stroke Electric Start, the driver swivel seat was custom installed, and I added the following toys to it:  Lowrance Elite 7 HDI fishfinder Minn Kota Powerdrive V2 trolling motor with a power series deep cycle 185 battery Canon Downrigger Deckhand 40 power anchor winch with 25 lb anchor 2 additional Scotty Rod holders 2 dock bumpers driver-side mounted cup holder  Best money I ever wasted!  In hind sight if you're thinking of a boat similar, I should just point out you will be a bit limited with this one as to where is safe to venture out.  It handle 1-3 foot waves not too bad, but any more than that I wouldn't go there.  I'm actually thinking of upgrading to a Nitro Z-7 next year so who knows it may show up in the for sale section this winter  Tony"
