865553,fishindevil,2014-07-30 09:53:00,6254,Wish every summer was this way !!!! Love it !!! Ya it's nice to be able to spend 12hrs in the boat on the lake and not COOK TO DEATH !!!! Great for sleeping in and working in !!!!
865559,SirCranksalot,2014-07-30 12:18:00,3291,"went for a paddle yesterday---no sweat, no sunscreen, no bugs. Perfecto!!!  ( and I've had it with weather folks who inject their opinion re what is a 'nice' day. Just give us the bloody forecast and keep your opinions to yourself!)"
865562,kickingfrog,2014-07-30 12:22:00,8333,"I really like a mild summer, but I know that it doesn't come without consequences."
865576,wkimwes,2014-07-30 13:56:00,76,"i like the cool temps  but can do without the rain and wind That is the part I'm not happy about, but everything else I'm golden."
865578,Lucky Linda,2014-07-30 14:10:00,93,I would rather the cool temps. I love winter actually! Easier to put on a jacket than pull myself back into the boat after diving in to cool down. ?
865588,Headhunter,2014-07-30 16:01:00,5703,"Well, I prefer a hot summer. This nonsense should be ""enjoyed"" during May and September. I blame that dirty rotten jet stream. HH"
865597,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-30 17:12:00,10439,Record high here in Yellowknife yesterday may break another today.
865598,Rod Caster,2014-07-30 17:22:00,5784,Record high here in Yellowknife yesterday may break another today. You could always move south to get away from the heat.... Now that is an odd thought.
865607,TJQ,2014-07-30 18:17:00,7806,Ill take this cool weather anytime!!
865625,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-30 19:16:00,10439,You could always move south to get away from the heat.... Now that is an odd thought.  I moved up here to get away from Southern Ontario summers.
865719,Paudash,2014-07-31 03:48:00,273,going on holidays next week and I hope it warms up but I am loving these cool nights
865784,AKRISONER,2014-07-31 17:45:00,5558,nothing like being able to go for a run at 2 in the afternoon and be totally comfortable.  Even better is sleeping at night and riding my bike to and from work in the mornings without being a sweaty pig by the time i get to work or home.
865809,davey buoy,2014-07-31 20:05:00,5505,"nothing like being able to go for a run at 2 in the afternoon and be totally comfortable.

Loving it as well.  ,but I'm not heading to the beach either,lol."
865286,kuhaman,2014-07-28 23:36:00,503,Just had to light up the woodstove! Not feeling like summer in this neck of the woods!
865287,porkpie,2014-07-28 23:39:00,2521,I'm loving it!  Best summer ever so far!
865292,Rod Caster,2014-07-28 23:46:00,5784,Me too man. It's been great for working around the property.
865307,OhioFisherman,2014-07-29 01:05:00,6623,"The high here hit 67 degrees F, my kind of weather! I went to Florida once in August, and thought I was in hell! LOL"
865311,Terry,2014-07-29 01:17:00,14456,i like the cool temps  but can do without the rain and wind
865313,lew,2014-07-29 01:18:00,12766,"The high here hit 67 degrees F, my kind of weather!  Same here Paul, I'll take 67 over 87 any day of the week."
865322,Joeytier,2014-07-29 02:00:00,3990,I feel like slapping anyone I hear complaining about this weather
865324,Steelheadphycho,2014-07-29 02:05:00,470,It's all my fault..........  Because I installed a swimming pool this year.  Last Friday the pool was 80 deg F  Today it's 70  WHY ?
865327,pike slayer,2014-07-29 02:12:00,1177,i cant complain about the temps its nice. The only thing is that i've noticed around the sault area is that the leaves are already starting to change!!
865328,solopaddler,2014-07-29 02:12:00,8605,It's all my fault..........  Because I installed a swimming pool this year.  Last Friday the pool was 80 deg F  Today it's 70  WHY ?   I can make it rain by going camping. A weekend trip will induce light showers. A week long trip and people start building arks.  Farmers should pay me for my services.
865333,OhioFisherman,2014-07-29 02:22:00,6623," Same here Paul, I'll take 67 over 87 any day of the week.  I wonder how many people would be so eager to head south if they hadn't of invented air conditioning? Granted that it was my first trip that far south and I was already heat sensitive due to MS, but a couple of hours outside in the morning and late evening was all I could handle.  65-75 always seemed like perfect weather to me, especially out in a boat fishing!"
865347,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-29 04:04:00,10439,We could use some of that cool wet weather up here. Hasn't rained since June and the temps have been hot and windy. T'was 27 today and will be again tomorrow.
865351,davey buoy,2014-07-29 07:59:00,5505,Perfect weather as well for me.Nice sleeping temps. Hardly any AC being used..Fishing has been good as well.What more could a fella want?.
865357,mattyk,2014-07-29 10:57:00,2110,It's 57 degrees here and 77 for the high today! I love it!!!!
865362,leaf4,2014-07-29 11:31:00,2466,"I'll take these nightly lows any summer, saves my electric bill (or at least if I'm the one watching the stat) my brother had it set to 72 when it's 64 outside lol - waste of energy.)"
865369,kuhaman,2014-07-29 12:22:00,503,"I feel like slapping anyone I hear complaining about this weather Not complaining, I love it too. Just not used to lighting up the ole woodstove til about mid september."
865372,bigugli,2014-07-29 12:37:00,6138,Sounds more like Suomen suven.  I can recall many an August night needing to fire up the woodstove.
865375,kuhaman,2014-07-29 12:52:00,503,"Sounds more like Suomen suven.  I can recall many an August night needing to fire up the woodstove. Ya ,for sure. I have fond memories of those days too"
865391,d_paluch,2014-07-29 13:35:00,343,"Odd summer this year, thats forsure  During the work week it can be as cool as it wants, I wouldn't mind a few more scorching hot weekends at the cottage to be honest with you."
865400,Rod Caster,2014-07-29 13:46:00,5784,"Is it another polar vortex? Haha. Someone told me that and I said, it's also called 'a cool summer'."
865488,JoshS,2014-07-29 20:59:00,729,"I'm loving this weather. I can't understand why some would rather sweat than be comfortable. I can understand being on a beach or dock, but other than that 22 is way better than 32! The musky like this weather way better too."
865493,misfish,2014-07-29 21:41:00,29133,They say warmer then norm winter. That means river fishing again up here .  Dont say it BillM
865504,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-29 23:26:00,10439,+29C right now in Yellowknife. Feels like 32.
865510,Steve,2014-07-29 23:59:00,2075,+19C in the Hammer.  strange weather these days. NWT 10 degrees warmer than here.
865519,moxie,2014-07-30 01:06:00,1566,Been a real pleasant surprise temp wise and were turning the corner into August. No complaints here.
