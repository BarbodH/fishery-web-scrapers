Fairly young guy and gal cops had a 300 hp very new looking Mercury Verado.  Couldn't help myself from yelling  "" Shoulda got a Yammy""  They weren't impressed with the situation to say the least"

865566,Garnet,2014-07-30 12:32:00,2056,If it was a Yammy the parts would be on a boat and here by Nov.
865569,lew,2014-07-30 12:53:00,12766,If it was a Yammy the parts would be on a boat and here by Nov.  Wouldn't be necessary as Yammie's don't break down
865571,Garnet,2014-07-30 12:58:00,2056,Thiers only 2 outboard out their. Blown up out boards and those that are going to blow up.
865572,BillM,2014-07-30 13:04:00,17367,"Why do I think that this has nothing to do with the motor and all to do with them hitting something? You should see what the young kid do the Coast Guard boats, it's almost unbelievable."
865574,Spanky80,2014-07-30 13:38:00,152,"I hope that the two rope used met the stringent Ontario standards to keep us all safe from certain death, and the boater towed the OPP boat in a manner that meets the stringent Ontario standards to keep us all safe from certain death, and that the OPP officers had their life jackets securely done up to meet the stringent Ontario standards to keep them safe from certain death.

865577,trevy727,2014-07-30 14:09:00,351,Yammies break too when you hit rocks.
865580,ecmilley,2014-07-30 14:45:00,2163,Dont really care whats on the back of it $120 000 to purchase of taxpayers money and taxpayers gonna fix it
865581,jimmer,2014-07-30 14:52:00,2730,"I agree, their boats are a little over kill for the Kawarthas. What a waste of money."
865641,captpierre,2014-07-30 20:17:00,2521,"Actually, I'm glad they  buy North American.  That's what governments should do IMO.  Couple years ago I saw an American Coast Guard boat with 2 big Hondas on the back.  If there is an outboard made  in the home country, those are the ones governments should buy.  It's all about image and manufacturing jobs."
865648,davey buoy,2014-07-30 20:40:00,5505,"Just like the opp and metro,and most others with there crown vic intersepters,chargers etc.Maybe water vessels don't follow the same rule??,agree it should."
