We were fishing with worms on bobbers. He got 4 largemouth and he caught his biggest ever largemouth. We got a ton of bluegill too, but they were not as fun as the largies! He was so excited and there were lots of screams of excitement! He was telling everybody that he was a bass master.        "

865622,AKRISONER,2014-07-30 19:09:00,5558,i need to start teaching my nephew to fish. So far we have only allowed him to use a weight with no hook because he is a total madman...I wonder if I got him to catch a sun fish on a bobber if it would calm him down enough....
865687,mattyk,2014-07-31 00:11:00,2110,Akrisoner  It does with my son. He gets so excited when we see the bobber go down. I don't have time to use my rod. He takes all my attention.
