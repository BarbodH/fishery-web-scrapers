I've seen some stuff on the Canadian tire website but am skeptical. Does anyone have any first hand experience with anything of this nature to fix them?  "

This product is the one that actually works.  http://www.caswellplating.com/restoration-aids/epoxy-gas-tank-sealer/dragons-blood-gas-tank-sealer.html  The chemistry of gas makes most all external applied products at best, temporary at worst fails completely. The correct way to seal a tank is to etch the metal with a special cleaner and then to rotate the tank as the epoxy cures. There are videos on the process if you search for motorcycle tank sealing.

Like almost any product, the success is directly related to the way the surface is prepped.  http://www.permatex.com/products-2/product-categories/specialized-maintenance-repair/radiator-fuel-tank-repair/permatex-fuel-tank-and-radiator-repair-kit2013-05-21-19-14-47-detail"
