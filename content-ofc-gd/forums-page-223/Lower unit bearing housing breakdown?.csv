865226,ch312,2014-07-28 19:20:00,1590,"2006 Yamaha 90hp 4 stroke   Can anyone tell me how to disassemble the lower unit bearing housing? I'm replacing the housing, bearings, and seals with new parts and want to reuse the old gear but cannot figure out how to get the old one apart.  The shaft is removed so now it's just the housing with the o-ring and gear on one end... "
