865004,misfish,2014-07-27 17:31:00,29133,Thats some nice waters there. Nice buckets.  Almost looks like spots Justin Hoffman fishes out that way.
865075,Christopheraaron,2014-07-27 23:28:00,3525,It doesn't get any better than flipping grass and trees!
865080,Spanky80,2014-07-27 23:55:00,152,Wow nice work!  Flipping and pitching is definitely something I need to improve on and try more often.

865145,farsider,2014-07-28 12:59:00,456,"Nice haul!  I especially like the boat mods you have made to the aluminum. Any more pics of those?  What you are happy with and what you would change or do different?  Cheers, Mark"
