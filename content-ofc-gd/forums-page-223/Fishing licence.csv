864935,mistaredone,2014-07-27 13:08:00,913,So instead of printing off the conformation page of my licence renewal I saved the screen shot on my phone. Of course I killed yet another phone and no longer have that conformation and I'm still waiting for my licence to come in the mail. How do I get proof of my licence?
864938,kickingfrog,2014-07-27 13:40:00,8333,"No email confirmation? Lesson learned.  I guess you could fish and take your chances that the CO would believe you and give you a chance to produce your licence, but Murphy's law usually reins.  Maybe the website has some solutions or try going to a service Ontario office during the week."
864939,Terry,2014-07-27 13:46:00,14456,"well if you type in your info it will tell you  the status, that wight be enough"
864952,mistaredone,2014-07-27 14:47:00,913,Right!  If I re-apply it should show my licence status. Thanks guys
864953,BillM,2014-07-27 14:48:00,17367,"They can also look up if you've got a valid license or not, but they still might ding you for not having it onboard."
864954,Raycaster,2014-07-27 14:49:00,528,I know with the Boating license you can phone and have them send you a temp. pdf file you can print up. I have a slow pontoon and am targeted the minute I launch from Balsam every year. I have been stopped 3 times in 18 months while boats around me are breaking Guinness Speed Records.... grumpy... a little.
864961,BillM,2014-07-27 15:01:00,17367,Probably because they think you're on a booze cruise

Sorry about your luck but if you can be caught the easiest because you are the slowest then can you blame them? LOL Seriously, I don't boat but I have seen a few times when it appears the OPP's that are out seem to be treating it as a paid vacation day..."
864998,BassHunterOttawa,2014-07-27 16:58:00,29,"What kind of phone is it? And how did you break it? A screenshot is just an image file, and if it's an Android or Blackberry, I know how you could recover the data (if the hd isn't pooched)"

Buddy #1 catches a fish and chooses buddy #2 to go for a swim. I'm lmao and buddy #2 decides to take me with him for the swim, phone and all. Brand new 5s fried. Good times still"
