It makes an electronic whirring sound when i press the button but does not seem to be connecting to the engine....its sounds like something is spinning freely in there but not connected to anything. It will need to warm up a bit before i can turn it over with the pull start."
760001,mr blizzard,2013-01-17 15:47:00,1589,"Hey Simon, We had the same or similar problem with ours when we moved here. The spring was to cold and stiff and not pushing the starter gear down all the way to the flywheel, we had to gently warm the starter with a hair dryer it worked, but were warned not to heat up to quick as it could crack things, all I know is it worked for us. -43 here today. Liked your video, check ours on the weather network, fun isn't it. Sometimes after u use the blower a bit of moisture will freeze in there after the machine cools off."

760017,Skipper D,2013-01-17 16:11:00,1970,"x's 2 , if it worked good the last time you used it .Some cold nights here we have the same problem on our 125 horse power tractors , we get  the heat gun to the starter and away it go's ....."

760023,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-17 16:28:00,10439, When I lived in Ontario I only used the electric starter once too Bill. Now that I live in the far North I would not even be able to get it started without the electric starter.
760058,Old Man,2013-01-17 17:18:00,822,"Hey Simon. I'm assuming it's an MTD brand of snowblower with a Tecumseh motor.The spline collar is probably the culprit.  If so, this link may help.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VprSphnQqk"
760083,limeyangler,2013-01-17 18:16:00,5204,"Thanks folks, will check out all suggestions.   Got all the snowblowing done....now do i wanna head out fishing in minus 28C with a 30kmh wind?....probably....lol."
