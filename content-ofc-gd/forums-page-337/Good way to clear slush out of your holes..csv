Most times when fishing i will drill lots of holes in a pattern to cover some contours at any given spot. Usually when with buddies, we have a couple drilling holes and someone else following behind clearing slush...usually get most of it out with the auger.....but  would this be neat when you had a lot of holes and wanted to clear them fast!  http://www.slushcopter.com/Videos.html"
760209,kickingfrog,2013-01-18 00:45:00,8333,"And had no issues with the slush floating up the other holes as you ""clean"" the others?  If your holes aren't that close I guess it has a purpose, but I just scoop mine."
760250,NAW,2013-01-18 02:50:00,4022,I try to run as light as I can.  And half my holes are full of slush half the time.  Doesn't bother me when I'm running hole to hole.  I'd have not room for that thing.  Neat idea though.
760257,kemper,2013-01-18 02:59:00,2232,"It's neat, no doubt about that.  Would I carry it around? Not a chance.  I'll scoop, I think."
760271,irishfield,2013-01-18 03:50:00,26272,"Notice it only works if you pack a slush ball in the hole! Besides... I've learned, from being schooled by others, first fish is obtainable by shoving your spoon thru the slush and jigging... so it doesn't see the light!"
760575,Dabluz,2013-01-19 04:09:00,701,I fish where there is current so there is a good chance that I spend the rest of the day cleaning slush from my ice holes.  I also run light.  An ice scoop already takes up a lot of space.  Carrying something that is almost as large as a manual auger is out of the question.
760579,Joey,2013-01-19 04:45:00,9122,"Neat idea, but as has been said, just another thing to find room for unfortunately!"
760600,Rich,2013-01-19 13:16:00,3927,"There's barely any slush when the ice is never over 4"""
760618,GbayGiant,2013-01-19 14:22:00,1780,If the guy spent a little more time driling his holes properly he wouldn't have had to drag a shovel or the slush copter out with him. Would also have helped if he did not fill his holes back up with slush after they were cleaned out by the auger in the first place. Way to much time.
