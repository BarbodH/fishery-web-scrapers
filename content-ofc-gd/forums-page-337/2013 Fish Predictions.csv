759381,Guest,2013-01-15 03:44:00,0,I thought of that last year and wondered if it would actually work.  Your sitting making a few cast and then all you hear is thump on the bottom of your boat.  Cool

I'd like to see (I don't need to catch it) an Ontario record sheephead this year.  My buddy caught one last year that tips the scales at 15.5 pounds and he says on clear days he has seen bigger. I'd love to see one pushing 20+.

759112,Guest,2013-01-14 16:44:00,0,"Hey guys.  Just thought I would post a topic on what are going to be the big ones that I am going to catch this year.  My main goal is to catch at least a 20 inch bass.  Dont care if its smallmouth or largemouth.  Almost had it last year, but lost it right at the boat.  Im hoping to beat my pike record of 30 inches too.  I know thats small, but the lake I fish in doesnt have big ones.  Also I would like to beat my perch record of 12.5 inches.  Had a 12 this year at Cooks, so I was close.  What about you guys."

759122,Fang,2013-01-14 17:12:00,1330,"Winter target would be a whitefish that gets it's shoulders caught in a 6"" hole  For spring, I'm looking for a 30lb carp (several high 20's over the last few years) and I'll also be trying to add a few on the centre pin. Be nice to do both together.  and about the only thing I really have a jones on for is a big rainbow out on the lake, something that'll nudge that 20lb mark (2 years ago I had a piggy on in out in the blue zone that was so fat it couldn't jump out of the water. All it did was get halfway and then fall back  - still haunted by those images as it threw the hook close to the boat)"

Find a few more ""secret"" fishing spots and camping locations.  Hit the big lakes with somebody from this board for salmon or steelhead."

759265,Rich,2013-01-14 23:15:00,3927,"I imagine I'll slam perch, crappies, gills and big northerns through the ice. I'll spend spring catching giant catfish and carp, steelhead and crappies. In the summer I'll focus on trophy bass and pike worth catching (38"" and up). Fall continues that, accompanied by big salmon and spring trout. Hope to get up for muskies and some bigger walleye this year at some point, as well as catch my first laker."
