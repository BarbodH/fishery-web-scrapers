759745,mercman,2013-01-16 18:19:00,7054,i almost choked !!!!
759781,Reelaction,2013-01-16 21:41:00,33,"How about several strands of fiberglass insulation to simulate tiny water fleas. Could wrap them around your favourite downrigging outfit and show the kids how hard it is to real up a big Lake O Chinny.  or  Glue several layers of small pebbles on the inside of a 4"" abs pipe. Could simulate the effect zebra muscles have on our industrial and drinking water intake pipes."
759792,aplumma,2013-01-16 22:03:00,6896,Good example with the water pipe issue.  Art
759543,TJQ,2013-01-15 20:53:00,7806,Need some ideas quick!!  So Jaden is presenting a thing on invasive species tomorrow and shes got the content all written up.  She has to give some sort of a demonstration along with it.. but of course I cant get my hands on an invasive species this time of year..  It has to be something she can pass around the room to demonstrate what an invasive species does..  ie a girl thats doing one on asthma is passing a straw around so people can feel like what it feels like to breath with difficulty... i need something similar that gets some sort of point accross...  any one got any ideas.. im stumped....
759546,anders,2013-01-15 20:57:00,1168,Bring in a vaccuum and attach it to your arm...turn it on = lamprey  stuff like that?
759548,TJQ,2013-01-15 20:58:00,7806,YES!!  Ideas exactly like that.
759549,anders,2013-01-15 20:59:00,1168,that one was free  bring in a plate of food and then have someone eat it all fast = cormorant!

759554,aplumma,2013-01-15 21:09:00,6896,On the Cormarand thing bring a bag with X amount of stuff equal to a days/week worth of fish they eat.   Art
759556,Acountdeleted,2013-01-15 21:10:00,2562,"Its a shame its such a far drive, would be easy to get and preserve some round gobies this time of year. A minnow trap with kibble and 15 minutes down on Lake Ontario always yeilded about 4 or 5 whenever I needed some for presentations."
759557,Christopheraaron,2013-01-15 21:11:00,3525,then drop a bag of mayonnaise on everyone for the waste
759558,Spiel,2013-01-15 21:12:00,9065,"Wow, I'm truly impressed with the off the cuff (quick) ideas. Great stuff guys, very creative."
759559,SylvanOwner,2013-01-15 21:13:00,266,"Not to split hairs here but are you meaning ""invasive"" or ""non-native""?  Invasive meaning something that tends to take over or displace existing flora/fauna.  Non-native meaning a specie that is not historically found in a specific area and then establishes in that area (usually aided by human means but not always)  example:  -small mouth bass can be invasive when stocked in a natural brook trout lake, smallies will often out-compete brook trout but surrounding lakes make be naturally full of small mouth and are therefore argueably native to the region. -zebra mussels are non-native to Ontario and wouldn't be here at all without human assistance because they can't move from Russia by themselves, they are non-native and invasive  earthworms are also non-native to North America and invasive and also attainable this time of year (even in the Gret White North) and also would make excellent classroom show and tell  ....just saying.  If she gets an A, I want credit....."
759560,Christopheraaron,2013-01-15 21:14:00,3525,"Oh, you could grab some rainbow smelt from the grocery store, they are a big problem in algonquin..."
759562,Acountdeleted,2013-01-15 21:16:00,2562,Personally (just because I do a lot of work with them) I love the lamprey/vaccum cleaner idea. She could attach it to a kid (or the teachers arm) they can comment how its mildly agitating and then she can mention how it must feel to not be able to remove that from your body due to lack of hands and then go into further detail.
759563,Nipfisher,2013-01-15 21:17:00,2449,"How about a jar full of water. Then add a drop of food colouring to it, then another drop, then another drop. The change in colour will represent the way a species can take over a lake like rock bass killing off walleye and perch populations up North."
759566,Raf,2013-01-15 21:19:00,3495,Bring in a white man and point to North America. Did I just say that?
759570,Acountdeleted,2013-01-15 21:23:00,2562,"Oh Oh I totally forgot, or bring in a small fish tank with weeds planted in it and nice rocky shoals but with mud underneath. Then let the kids scoop up all the mud and make a mess with shovels and explain thats what common carp do.  Or ask the kids to sound like a boat and then throw large fish at them. Asian Carp!"
759571,Christopheraaron,2013-01-15 21:23:00,3525,LOL!     Nice!
759572,aplumma,2013-01-15 21:23:00,6896,an asian carp eats 5 to 10 percent of it's body weight per day.  A cormorant eats 400-500 grams (1 lb) per day.  A bag of styrofoam peanuts would be pretty dramatic per pound.   Art
759580,Gerritt,2013-01-15 21:45:00,6129,"TJ, show up shirtless.... Sturgeon Falls Sasquatch.  Just a thought"
759589,moxie,2013-01-15 22:23:00,1566,Like this one the best so far.
759590,TJQ,2013-01-15 22:28:00,7806,  So does jaden!!
759592,Roy,2013-01-15 22:40:00,13728,A hole saw would be a closer match to what a lamprey can do. Their mouth is essentially made the same way and can burrow their way right through a fish. Teacher gets it first.
759594,moxie,2013-01-15 23:00:00,1566,Hole saw huh? Veeeery subtle.
759603,Locnar,2013-01-15 23:15:00,645,"Get a Norway Maple twig, which is what most maple trees in the big cities/suburbs are... They are prolific seeders and highly invasive."
759627,Guest,2013-01-16 01:14:00,0,Best idea so far
759703,Christopheraaron,2013-01-16 14:46:00,3525,What did she end up choosing to do?
