760194,carll2,2013-01-17 23:44:00,443,i really like power pro and suffix
760197,MJL,2013-01-17 23:48:00,2427,"I primarily fish outside of a hut. For lakers, I use 8lb Berkley Trilene XL. My UL panfish reel is spooled up with 4lb Berkley Micro ice. If I was inside a hut, I'd be more inclined to use braid or a superline of some sort."
760203,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-18 00:29:00,2690,Used the P Line Ice for the first time last year and loved it. The 5 lb was perfect up at Nipissing.
760206,dheitzner,2013-01-18 00:35:00,314,I've had good luck withBerkley Micro Ice as well (4 to 8lb test depending what rod it's on)... 
760223,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-18 01:22:00,10439," Yep, Duracast is all I use."
760224,ColdH20guy,2013-01-18 01:32:00,312,thanks guys!
760227,Leecher,2013-01-18 01:42:00,7832,"I like to use Power Pro Ice as my main line tied to a barrel swivel, tied to Trilene Cold Weather mono leader.... this for my jigging rods... for my dead sticks, dacron seemed to be the best durable wise IMO   As for freezing / ice up, not much you can do about it... no matter type of line used, when it's cold, it will ice up or freeze. TJunkie"
760230,castgame,2013-01-18 01:48:00,161,how does fluoro fare on the ice? i remember having some trouble with breakage on a cold day steelheading
760237,adempsey,2013-01-18 02:01:00,1498,"I like all the superlines.   However, I've never had one that didn't freeze up.   I've tried line conditioner as well,  didn't seem to help much.  I always manage though.   Maybe I'll try the Tuf-Line as well."
760238,GBW,2013-01-18 02:05:00,8460,"make that 3x on the Tuf-Line Duracast, not even the ice version..."
760246,Joeytier,2013-01-18 02:35:00,3990,Trilene XL up to 8 lb. and XT for heavier applications...
760255,kevin booth,2013-01-18 02:55:00,57,"braid to flourcarbon,fire line or spider wire."
760259,kemper,2013-01-18 03:04:00,2232,"Trilene XL, but I rarely catch anything..."
760267,Freshtrax,2013-01-18 03:40:00,2215,triline 8 lb on the tipups and dead sticks.  braid to barrel to floro on the jiging sticks used in the hut.
760317,Raf,2013-01-18 13:12:00,3495,Still prefer mono on the ice.
760322,BillM,2013-01-18 13:28:00,17367,Fireline on all my ice fishing rigs.
760329,Lunkerhunter,2013-01-18 13:57:00,455,powerpro ice braid or sufix ice braid with a flouro leader of course.  on my tip ups i use heavy mono with a smaller diameter leader
