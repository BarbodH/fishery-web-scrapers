758822,ckrb2007,2013-01-13 07:01:00,449,"My original plan was to head north with Kenzy31 (Jesse) to search for some back lakes but with the weather being less then favourable for icefishermen, we had to cancel. I got a call late in the week from my buddy, Todd saying that he was pulling his boat out of the barn and wanted to know if I was in. ""I'm in"".....flu and all.We got to the launch at around 8am in Barrie and were surprised to see all the boats. Guess we weren't the only mental ones. We got the boat in the water and made the 13km run out to the mouth of the bay. Conditions were pretty good, with it getting choppy only when you leave the bay due to the south winds.The fishing wasn't too bad. We ended up with 2 lakers, which went back and 3 whiteys for the table. All whiteys were taken with a Williams and the lakers with a white tube.  Here's the porn......  Todd's whitey....a nice long one. 36"" according to his tape. hahahaaha My Whiteys ...and here's the tank I got. We figure it went about 15lbs.   Cheers, Colin"
