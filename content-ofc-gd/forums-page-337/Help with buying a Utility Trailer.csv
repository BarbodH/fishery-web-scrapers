759744,Entropy,2013-01-16 18:18:00,747,"I'm looking to buy a utility trailer to use for camping, small home renos, firewood, dump runs, etc.  I'd like something I can tow behind a sub compact car and a lite SUV.  I don't want anything wider than 5.5 ft or longer than 8ft box.  I've been entertaining something like this:  http://www.homedepot.ca/product/5-by-7-marathon-galvanized-utility-trailer-60-084-tll/979143#BVRRWidgetID  Any suggestions?  Recomendations, Experiance?  Thanks,  Entropy"

759759,wormdunker,2013-01-16 19:04:00,1711,"I'm searching as well.  Lots on Kijiji St. Catharines.  Priced from $200.00 - $900.00  Good luck in your search!  Get something decent for $400.00 if you want to do a few minor repairs, such as paint."

759795,trevy727,2013-01-16 22:12:00,351,I have a trailer maybe identical to the one in the ad you posted. It's about 1.5 years old and I've only used it 3-5 times. I'd be willing to sell it for $800 if you're interested.
759797,tb4me,2013-01-16 22:37:00,3295,"I have this trailer for sale right now..$550.00 to any OFC member.Its light and handy, im just out of room..http://brantford.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-RVs-campers-trailers-cargo-utility-trailers-5-x-11-landscape-quad-hauler-for-sale-W0QQAdIdZ437362828"
759832,pikehunter,2013-01-17 00:28:00,1659,"You can do better. There is a trailer dealer in Waterloo? Guelph? Forget exactly where, but they advertise occasionally on kijiji and they offfer galvanized trailers and some with sides at better prices the H.D. But if you are planning on buying with a H.D c.card to take advantage of 6 months no interest or 10% off or whatever the deal is this month then H.D is a decent option. Me, I'd rether buy from a dealer, even though I work for the big box.  I think this may be the place. They have a galvaized 5x7, folds out to 8' 4"",  for $975. It's al lot better looking than the one at Home Depot.. http://www.ontariotrailer.com/"
759835,moose,2013-01-17 00:36:00,266,if you buy brand new you at least have a warrantee and you know te bearings and tires are good
759867,Entropy,2013-01-17 02:34:00,747," Nice,  The $1200 one here http://www.ontariotrailer.com/untitled4.html  I like the higher side on it over the 5 x 7, but the price is nice.  Need a 5x7 with fold down front and higher sides.  Just thinking about camping gear bouncing out, and would rather not put plywood sides on, as that is what my current trailer looks like.  now would that be ok for future toys, like a sled, or ATV???  long enough?  I'd love to get that trailer for $1000 or less.  Anyone have any experiance with these TORSION axles?   Do they hold up?   I can't see myself putting more than 1500 pounds in.  Entropy"
