758805,ah_long,2013-01-13 04:09:00,354,is there a mobile version of OFC right now?  the full version doesn't seem to load properly and it's a mess on my phone (Google Nexus 4)
758808,Handlebarz,2013-01-13 04:30:00,3790,Yes you can change the setting at the bottom of the page I'm using it on my iPhone it works good but is very different from before
758826,Muskieman,2013-01-13 07:54:00,2472,Yep .. Different.. I like the upgrade . ..especially the box on the top right.
758828,fishindevil,2013-01-13 09:47:00,6254,I'm on my iPhone right now and I have both versions on my phone !! Try opening it in safari !!! Works great !!
758829,fishindevil,2013-01-13 09:52:00,6254,When I said both versions I meant the desktop version as well ad the mobile version !! I didn't have to change anything when the board changed it did it automatically on the mobile version as well !!!! To upload pics just send them to photobucket then paste img code back to ofc and you are good to go !!!! I use my iPhone to access it more than my laptop way faster !!!!
758858,Handlebarz,2013-01-13 14:29:00,3790,I have just been using the safari version I have not tried the app yet.
758870,i2cool2fool,2013-01-13 15:09:00,349,"The IP.Board app is nice. Before the upgrade, it's all I really use. I downloaded the new ""IP.Board Community"" app and prefer it when on this board but it doesn't play well with the other forums I visit.  I like the upgrade. Great work T.J. and gang!"
758885,kemper,2013-01-13 16:33:00,2232,Thumbs up for the IPB iPhone app
758916,TJQ,2013-01-13 18:21:00,7806,"Thanks guys... were working on new skins and perhaps were gonna add another mobile version as well, so lots to choose from EVENTUALLY.  The person we have hired to do the skins for us .. has just come off a bout with the flu, a bad one I may ad, and they are behind in work, so things will get done, just not as fast as I would like them to.  but rest assured we are doing everything we can to get things back to whatever we consider ""normal"" around here.  We're getting stuff done by professionals, I would do the skin install, but I'd rather have someone do it that does this type of thing every day rather than me or Roy would could easily make a mistake.  So everyone is just gonna have to be patient."
759027,ah_long,2013-01-14 03:04:00,354,Works good now. Thanks

759335,fishindevil,2013-01-15 01:44:00,6254,I am only using safari on my iPhone 4 do I just install the app like you said ?? What does that change ?? I don't want to install it if I don't understand what it does ?? I like the new setup just not used to it yet...and when in chat the message window is very small on the mobile version?? Is that normal or can I change it ?? Just not sure as I usually access the site from my phone more than my laptop !!!!
759354,nancur373,2013-01-15 02:38:00,1211,just open OFC on a normal web page. Go to the bottom where it says change theme. touch ip board mobile
759370,michigander fisherman,2013-01-15 03:07:00,64,Absolutely love the IPB app
759371,NAW,2013-01-15 03:12:00,4022,"Looks good on my I-phone.  Is there a way to have the green skin on my I phone?  Either way, works great.  Except when I try to type to fast I alway end up accidentally opening the app download screen..   That happens a lot.   Tricksters placing advertising links in common mis-strike areas....  Everyone does that.  Drives me nuts."
759406,GYPSY400,2013-01-15 10:40:00,191,"I downloaded the app, but I can't seem to login.. I do like the mobile version on Safari though.. One of the reasons I frequent this site."
