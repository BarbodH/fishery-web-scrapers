I read that it can read thru ice which would be handly. Can you also use it from a boat? I'm guessing the boat would have to stay still, but would the cord be even long enough?"

759737,Tdel,2013-01-16 17:41:00,393,I have a Marcum ShowDown Troller Sonar but haven't used it for ice fishing yet. I have used it in the fall on a 16ft aluminum boat when we were drift fishing and liked it a lot. I didn't think my eyes could handle the multiple flashing colours that other flashers have so I bought the Marcum. I bought it mainly for ice fishing and portability but it can be used from a boat too as long as the distance from the water to the gunnel is less than six ft.  The cord on it is six feet long.
