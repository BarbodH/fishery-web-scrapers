759701,Rich,2013-01-16 14:31:00,3927,Has anybody used it? Looks awesome! A cell sized aqua-vu! Very much want to order one but hoped to get some real life reviews before dropping $400.
759702,BillM,2013-01-16 14:32:00,17367,"Ouch, $400 for something that probably costs $25, lol."
759707,buick14,2013-01-16 14:57:00,741,Im interested as well....
759719,Lunker777,2013-01-16 16:17:00,866,seems like alot of $$$ to watch a cell phone sized screen....
759721,Fisherman,2013-01-16 16:20:00,7201,"I've read a few comments on other sites, the most mentioned is it only has a 50' cable which limits your depth.  Second is the lack of a power port to provide backup power when the battery depletes.  Battery is supposed to be good for about 6 hours.   Other than that, most seem to like the clarity and small size for portability.  I almost bought one at the x-mas sale at Tromblys, but like usual, wrong item and wrong price."
759726,Tdel,2013-01-16 16:53:00,393,Cabela's.ca has Aqua-Vu Micro priced at $319.99 Haven't used it so can't give any kind of review to help you.   This one isn't the + version.
759739,buick14,2013-01-16 18:02:00,741,lol wrong price there I bet....
759740,buick14,2013-01-16 18:03:00,741,"Im a little sketched out with ""aqua vu"" seeing as it seems like ownership has bounced around a few times lately, so I dont know of the long term quality on these puppies"
759746,Rich,2013-01-16 18:24:00,3927,It'd be nice if they sold the camera / cable on its own and teamed it with a smartphone app. THAT would be ultimate.
759747,Rich,2013-01-16 18:26:00,3927,"The + version does have AC input, AND video output for recording or transferring to a larger screen (tablet etc). The 50' cable will be 30' too much for almost all my fishing trips, so that doesnt bother me."
