759480,Twocoda,2013-01-15 17:17:00,4130,"Scary stuff going on in the MNR. New proposed changes to the implementation and regulations of the Endangered Species Act (2007) including broad and vague exemptions. All for the sake of budget, and yet they haven't even finished implementing the original Act, and permit fees don't cover the cost of issuing them... Please comment! The MNR needs to use their heads and be held accountable! See http://www.ontarionature.org/act/action_alerts/alert_template.php?n_code=582 for more info."
759660,pics,2013-01-16 04:49:00,1268,The government wants to make it easier to develop the ring of fire and other big projects like mega quarries without red tape. Good for big corporations but bad for everything else. Must be some serious lobbying going on.....
759664,MuskieWannabe,2013-01-16 05:26:00,79,"This all starts at the Federal Level...They gut the Environmental Act in their latest omnibus bill thus causing this, they have downloaded all of the environmental proctection laws to the provinces who cannot manage that much of an increase.  If the federal government thought about us the provincial government would not have to do this, without raises taxes..."
759668,Rod Caster,2013-01-16 08:05:00,5784,"Yup, please make your comments heard on the ""environmental registry"". Just google Environmental Bill of Rights and search through the listings pertaining to the Endangered Species Act. They got an earfull from me."
759694,moxie,2013-01-16 13:47:00,1566,"We need an open season on politicians. No hunger strikes, blockades or protests that are pushed to the side of the road and not taken seriously. A short, week long window to sting the thieves that continue to lower our  quality of life without impunity. It might seem a tad Barbaric but it would keep them accountable."
759696,limeyangler,2013-01-16 14:08:00,5204,yeah....but they got rid of the gun registry
759762,Twocoda,2013-01-16 19:30:00,4130,Omnibus Bills blatantly defy democracy.....Can anyone answer why they even exist? This is why every Canadian has a vested interest in the Idle No More Movement regardless of the colour of your skin.
759779,torco,2013-01-16 21:29:00,656,Lets not forget the gutting of the navigable waterways protection act as part of the omni. Omin-bills should be outlawed
