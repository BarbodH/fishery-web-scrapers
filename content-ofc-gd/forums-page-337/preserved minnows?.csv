759908,BucktownAngler,2013-01-17 05:02:00,582,   i must be confused here.  are we talking about lake herring? (cisco)  where would you even find live herring?
759909,Christopheraaron,2013-01-17 05:23:00,3525,Trap them....
759919,Freshtrax,2013-01-17 06:28:00,2215,Catch one.  You just can't do it on simcoe.
759934,gaspumper,2013-01-17 12:05:00,393,"Gerritt I see your from Brighton,Luckys convenience  on the Loyalist Parkway is maybe 10 min.from you"
760061,mike rousseau,2013-01-17 17:27:00,4661,I tried cabelas preserved minnows...  They are cheap and you don't have to keep em alive....  But they don't really work well...  They are stiff so even when jigging the it looks like a twig on your hook...  And the flesh is kinda mushy... They fall off the hook...  I tried em one year and never got em again....
758033,Gerritt,2013-01-10 12:47:00,6129,Anyone use preserved minnows? I have a hard time finding minnows locally so I was thinking of picking up a package of preserved minnows.... worth the 13.99 for a pouch of them?  G
758034,moxie,2013-01-10 13:05:00,1566,Long long ago we used to keep the smaller panfish and layer them in a pail with the odd layer of salt and use them to chum our hut in the winter but never with minnows.
758073,4x4bassin,2013-01-10 16:41:00,1025,"I have not had very good luck with those preserved minnows , they tend to be a little ""fragile"" and rip off the hook easy. I now salt up a bunch of shinners in the spring and they last me all year ."
758074,BillM,2013-01-10 16:49:00,17367,"If you can't keep your minnows alive at the house, just salt them... So much easier."
758077,Christopheraaron,2013-01-10 16:56:00,3525,"I think I know the answer, but If i trap minnows in the spring and then salt them can I keep as many as I want? (provided i only have120 alive at a time)"
758079,4x4bassin,2013-01-10 17:00:00,1025,"I believe that you can't have anymore then your limit at one time in your possesion , dead or alive ."
758081,adolson,2013-01-10 17:09:00,783,"I bought a couple packages of those last year and caught nothing on them.  But I don't know if that says more about the bait or more about my lack of fishing skill.  I catch a lot on worms, though."
758089,richyb,2013-01-10 17:19:00,774,I have tried them and caught diddly squat. They have an alcohol smell or something to them that I dont think the fish like. I was trying them out for catfish just laying on the bottom with no luck. Maybe on a jig or something where they are moving and are more of a visual thing they would work better.
758253,camillj,2013-01-11 03:53:00,1988,I been freezing my left over minners for years .... and then use em in the winter for ice fishin .... I dont salt em ... just dump the water and stick the bag in the freezer .... caught some big-ash Lakers on last years suckers/shiners etc.  Just saying   Honestly though I would say you would be better off going to your grocery store and buying some frozen herring (chop em up if necessary) ... lots of old timers caught lots of monster lakers on grocery store herring !
758271,Guest,2013-01-11 10:54:00,0,Got minnows right now in my fridge from yesterdays ice fishing trip.  Hopefully they can last until next Wednesday.
758278,hirk,2013-01-11 12:23:00,571,"$13.99??? The preserved should be under $5,what brand were they?"
758280,MCTFisher9120,2013-01-11 12:31:00,3761,That's what I was thinking haha. We sell lot's but never hear good stories about them.
758284,Gerritt,2013-01-11 12:41:00,6129,Well I picked some up... seeing as how I cant get live here... and will give them a shot...  here is a picture of the package  
758288,Joeytier,2013-01-11 13:10:00,3990,"Never liked those packaged ones, but frozen shiners work just fine"
758366,hoosier,2013-01-11 17:21:00,29,Tried the exact same brand on a fly in this past year. Did not catch a single fish on them while at the same time my boys were nailing them with worms on their jigs.
758370,Christopheraaron,2013-01-11 17:30:00,3525,"If you can find 'em ya, but they aren't the easiest things to get."
758381,BucktownAngler,2013-01-11 18:09:00,582,didnt even know it was legal to use herring as bait.
758385,Christopheraaron,2013-01-11 18:23:00,3525,"Pretty sure you can use anything you buy from a store (if it's dead), for example shrimp makes good bait but it's not listed    (also, you can also use live herring)"
758418,Joeytier,2013-01-11 19:41:00,3990,Herring are not game fish so yes you can use them as bait
758421,Christopheraaron,2013-01-11 19:51:00,3525, Neither are carp but you can't use them as bait...  Herring are listed as a baitfish in the regulations
758562,Hooked,2013-01-12 05:38:00,891,I have heard of guys using smelt from the grocery store.  At times they would chop them into chunks and use them with success.  Whether that's legal or not not sure? But your best bet is to go artificial for now until it's time to net your own emeralds.....salt like others have said.  I personally have to work on my salting technique as they either dry out or get soggy.....
758569,Rich,2013-01-12 10:10:00,3927,You could use a carp as bait because it is a minnow.
758570,Rich,2013-01-12 10:13:00,3927,And the preserved minnows suck. They are filled with that fish repelling substance called BORAX which i have no idea why its still applied to any application related to fishing anymore.
758573,misfish,2013-01-12 11:01:00,29133,I have used that brand G.  GARBAGE. I also tried the dyed ones.GARBAGE.   Soryy you asked.   Im all for salting them.
758612,Nipfisher,2013-01-12 15:17:00,2449,"Gerritt, I was looking at those last time I was in Can. Tire. Pretty sure they were $5 but might have been a smaller package. Anyways I saw the have Anise scented ones. I have heard good things about nthe perch going wild on the Anise scent."
