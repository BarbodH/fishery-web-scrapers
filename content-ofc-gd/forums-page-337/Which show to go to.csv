759093,Oryx,2013-01-14 14:35:00,186,"i am in need of some advice here. The boss says that I can only go to one FISHING show this February and I need to choose. The first show is the Toronto Sportsman Show, Feb 7 - 10 th Exhibition place and the second show is the Spring Fishing and Boat Show Feb 15 - 18 at the international centre Can somebody enlighten me which is the better show for the angler as I have not been to either of themin the past.  Cheers"
759110,Guest,2013-01-14 16:37:00,0,I recommend the Toronto Sportsman Show.  They have everything from purchasing fishing lures to activites for the kids.  You can spend the whole day checking out the vendors.
759119,Steve,2013-01-14 17:08:00,2075,"""Spring Fishing and Boat Show Feb 15 - 18 at the international centre""  100000% for sure.  less junk that isn't fishing (or even remotely fishing related).  free parking.  better location.  Andy who runs the fishing show puts so much back into our fishing community while walter who runs the sportsman show only takes from our community while offering very little as a return."
759123,Fang,2013-01-14 17:15:00,1330,I'm going to just 1 and it'll be the Toronto one. I see less and less at the International each year and looking for a new venue to hopefully see something different
759144,TJQ,2013-01-14 18:19:00,7806,Ikll be at the spring show this year.  Missed it last year.. its a great time of year for Monique and myself to take a break!
759146,moxie,2013-01-14 18:28:00,1566,"I'll head up to the Spring Fishing and Boat show this year. Its been a few years since I've been to either but seems to me the Sportsman show should have stayed put where it was, in the Fall and my reasoning for this is simple. Why make me choose  ? If you spread them out I'd be more inclined to attend them both."
759147,BucktownAngler,2013-01-14 18:28:00,582," x 2  plus the musky seminar they had last year was great. im not sure if they will be doing that again this year. they have better deals on tackle  sportsman show didnt have much going on...too much non-fishing (or hunting) related stuff  they do have more outfitters at the sportsman show however, if youre looking to plan your next trip"
759183,Squid,2013-01-14 21:00:00,1656,The Musky seminar will most proably be a go this year again. We were very impressed with the turnout for the seminar!! Another show to consider is the Musky Odyssey in ST.Catherines /April 2013.
759283,Joeytier,2013-01-15 00:00:00,3990,"Sportsman show if you're interested in more than just fishing stuff.  Really enjoyed it the one time I went, but will never go again."
759314,danbouck,2013-01-15 01:13:00,4380,I'll be at the spring fishing and boat show in the Fish-A-Thon booth
759386,John Bacon,2013-01-15 04:01:00,3277, The Sportsman show supports Ringwood Hatchery.  I believe they have donated over $35 million to date.  I don't think it is fair to say that Walter that Sportsman show give very little in return.
759416,outllaw,2013-01-15 12:50:00,1232,i will head to the musky odeseye. ..put on by musky canada
759419,Oryx,2013-01-15 13:10:00,186,"Sounds like I will be going to The Spring show.  Thanks for all thee input. Might go on the ""Avoid My FAMILY DAY"" long weekend"
