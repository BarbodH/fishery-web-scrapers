760583,kemper,2013-01-19 06:04:00,2232,"Calling all rod builders... Does anyone happen to have a tip section for a Batson XST float blank (2 piece, 13')?  The part number is XST1562-F.  I didn't receive a receipt when I purchased the blank, and I doubt the warranty house at Batson is going to believe that for one minute.  Thanks!"
760586,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-19 06:19:00,10439,Just give Batson a call or email and if they won't cover it under warranty they will sell you a replacement.
760589,wall i,2013-01-19 06:32:00,48,Tell em you bought it used

760608,kemper,2013-01-19 13:49:00,2232," Email is out to Batson, that's the first thing I did hopefully they come through for me.  Thanks"
760610,kemper,2013-01-19 13:51:00,2232," Will do, does he carry Batson stock?  I build my own rods, so no issues there... I could repair it, but replacing the section is preferred."
760616,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-01-19 14:15:00,83,"""Will do, does he carry Batson stock?""  I don't know Kemper. My only connection with him was last year when he build me an Ice Fishing rod for Lakes and White Fish, which I did'nt get to use because of conditions. Like I said give him a call, he works shift so you might have to leave a message.  "
