759281,Joeytier,2013-01-14 23:57:00,3990,"rubbing shoulders with hooligans in the city or relative solitude on a pretty lake?  Seems simple to me!  Can't chime in as to ice safety, but I would guess smaller lakes are just fine."
759294,Christopheraaron,2013-01-15 00:30:00,3525,Can anyone who lives up there confirm?
759418,Rich,2013-01-15 13:06:00,3927,"It was two days of warmth. If there's still two inches here in the south i think muskokas are probably at about 12"" now."
759422,BillM,2013-01-15 13:18:00,17367, 12inches of what?  Ice?   That's wishful thinking..
759423,Rich,2013-01-15 13:23:00,3927,We were at 6 here before the thaw. Muskokas are usually double. Im talking small lakes.
759424,BillM,2013-01-15 13:31:00,17367," Even the back lakes aren't close to 12 inches, the weather up here has been as warm as it's been down there.   Cross your fingers for some cold weather."
759426,Christopheraaron,2013-01-15 13:37:00,3525,"Ya, we're going to wait till friday so that we're sure that we aren't wasting gas. Thanks everyone!"
