759520,ch312,2013-01-15 20:08:00,1590,"   you're suggesting that every hunter has been instructed to do the wrong thing by waiting 30 minutes? pushing a wounded animal into the next county where you'll probably lose the blood trail and never recover it is a better idea? unless you see or hear it go down, it's usually a good idea to wait a little bit to give the animal time to expire.  many deer are lost every year due to new/impatient hunters pushing wounded animals rather than giving them time to expire. the idea of giving a wounded animal time to die so you can actually recover it has been around since the spear throwing days..."
759522,ch312,2013-01-15 20:11:00,1590,"  this doesn't happen as a deer with a non lethal wound wouldn't lay down within sight and wait for a hunter to finish it off. it may eventually bleed out, which is why hunters are taught to give the animal time to lay down and die before attempting to retrieve the animal if it runs out of sight and/or farther than normal. if you pressure a wounded animal you may force it to run which dramatically lowers the chance of recovering the animal. it's recommended to leave a wounded animal for a half hour to overnight, depending on what it was shot with, where it was hit, and how it reacted to the shot. typically, a deer shot in the ""boiler room"" will expire well within 100 yards whether shot with a firearm or bow and can be retrieved immediately.  the only time a deer would drop on the spot and require a follow up shot is after a spine shot which is definitely lethal, just not very nice to watch. most hunters i know would gladly finish off the animal.   you're comparing giraffes to cucumbers here"

They usually expire quickly anyway.  Typically I keep perch, pickerel, crappie, and on occasion I keep steelies, usually when I need some skein, however I do eat smoked trout, but typically give away kings that I keep.  If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do.  It kills instantly, bleeds the fish out, keeps the meat fresh, and you will have no blood while cleaning, nor any blood in your eggs if your harvesting some roe as well.  Only way to fly IMHO, and I've been doing it for nearly 20 years now!  Give it a try.  I will add, I think all the purposefully distasteful comments about letting them flop and suffer for enjoyment, watching them gasp etc.. Are extremely distasteful."

759019,Rich,2013-01-14 02:23:00,3927,"Actually, for a fair comparison you'd have to smother the deer with a pillow. Fish have gills."
759021,John Bacon,2013-01-14 02:41:00,3277, Hunters typically try for a lung shot.  A lunge shot is not immediately fatal.  The deer will suffocate as its lungs fill with blood.  Hunters are typically taught to wait for the deer to dir after a lunch shot rather than persue the wouldn't animal.  Maybe not such a good example.

Three things I noticed. First cleaning the fish was really neat, no blood, second the meat was completely free of blood, and tasted better (sweeter) and third, the fish died very quickly. They bleed out real quick if you hang 'em upside down. To this day I bleed all the fish I keep.  In the summer when the water is warm I keep them alive until I get to the dock and do it. In the Spring and Fall when the water is really cold I just bleed them straight in the livewell. It just makes filleting a breeze and a clean job."

I do bleed walleye in the livewell and clean them once they have expired. Makes a bit of mess in the live well but it just pumps out and is clean quickly."

758844,crappieperchhunter,2013-01-13 13:27:00,2582,"I never really gave it much thought. Once I have made the decision to keep the fish in my mind I guess I already consider it dead because I have made the decision that it is now food. I have seen nature shows where animals are ripping apart there prey while it is still alive. It is what it is.  If your going to release the fish I say do everything possible to get it back in the water as quickly as possible. If you have made the decision to keep it for food, well then however you proceed from there on out is up to you."
758848,DoubleDigits,2013-01-13 13:49:00,140,"For best quality of meat, a little rigor mortis is necessary, I think. But If you're interested in an efficient means of fish killing, and also keeping flesh quality in mind, I would get the hang of Ikijime. This is the Japanese method of inserting a spike (an iki spike) into the fishes brain, causing it instant brain death, and apparently, blood from the muscles to travel to the gut. When you hit the right spot (between the eye and the false operculum) you will know it, because the the jaw will pop fully open, all the fins will flare, and then the fish will just go limp and be dead as a doornail. A filet knife works in place of the spike."

If you think that bonking the fish is any more ""humane"" than any other fishing, hooking and releasing, aquaculture, stocking (are we giving the fish more friends to hang out with), then you are very naive. Fishing is firstly to feed people, secondly a sport. Your imaginary line between ""humane"" and not ""humane"" treatment, based on a fish flopping on the ice, is completely made up in your head.  Wasting edible fish, or trying to hurt the fish for fun is deplorable and disturbing. Beyond that, enjoy your catch whichever way you prefer."

I only whack em so they don't flop and get blood in the wife's kitchen while I'm gutting them....  Considering we trick em into hitting our bait then sink a hook into their faces and fight them to exhaustion..,,,  being humane isn't really on the menu..."

758796,moxie,2013-01-13 03:11:00,1566,Worked on a kill floor for a couple of years and I can say that the process didn't always go according to plan but even when it did humane didn't make the grade there either. If it bleeds it will most certainly suffer.
