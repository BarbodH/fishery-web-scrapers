759613,Leecher,2013-01-15 23:50:00,7832,Awesome Marc    I love catching specks thru ice    Ice looks sketchy   Good on you for making the best of it even in poor condition   Can't wait to target them   It should harden up the top in the coming days     I'll make sure I'm ready for it
759628,Rod Caster,2013-01-16 01:26:00,5784,"YOu could have just punched your holes with a 4"" hand auger  Great report! That is exactly the type of fishing I'll be doing this coming weekend."
759673,Marc Thorpe,2013-01-16 10:48:00,621,"Hi Jacques,love fishing up there.Beautifull scenery Ice was very good saturday,water at the end of the day on the ice ,sunday it was just too iffy Next time I am up I let you know and see if your free to join us  RodCaster,ya I do use a large auger, we used 8 and 10 icnhers The ice had gone white and looked very brittle Good luck this weekend,we use small spoons,tiped with worms I dont think it mattered,Paul a buddy of mine who lives upthere used small jigs and did equally good  good cold weather is coming in so it will harderden what ever melt and make a nice thick chunk gonna take 2 -3 days for it to be safe"
759674,solopaddler,2013-01-16 10:49:00,8605,Very nice Marc! The first pic is truly excellent btw.

759691,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-01-16 13:31:00,310,Gotta love those QC brookies through the ice!!! Great pics dude.
759733,Leecher,2013-01-16 17:39:00,7832," Yes it's beautiful up there for sure.... love it    It's a great stress reliever for me when going up fishing.  Thanks for the info on ice!  Haven't been out yet this season and did not know the ice condition up there... now I have a general idea of thickness  Thanks for the invite Marc! Would be an honor to meet / join you guys!  Question:  Have you ever tried salties for specks?  The reason I ask is some times when their finicky, switching to salties triggers them to react and bite.  Other times worms works great or Gulp products such as paste in pink, fish fry or 1"" minnows.  Tight lines Jacques"
759923,Marc Thorpe,2013-01-17 10:12:00,621,"Mike B,the first pic shows how mythical that morning was  Joey,myself love th auger shot  Hi George hope all is well and wood dust is covering you  Jacques ,I have used Fry Minnows,small tubes ,small spoons (tipped with worms or maggots) Not sure what you refer to as salties They can be finicky Generally I have found when they are not bitting when there is motion,idling the bait/stop and wait after vigorous jigging they seem to take it. It seemed the way to get em this weekend,they would not take it while the bait was moving you had to jig short but agressively then iddle the bait,then they would take bite  we punched some 50 to 60 holes,kepts moving as they were scattered"
760099,Leecher,2013-01-17 18:57:00,7832," Marc, salties I refer to are frozen minnows in salt... I use those on my dead sticks and more often then not, specks just like that presentation over jigging spoons or jigs.  I've even got some on my jigging rods while they were in the rod holder.... go figure"

760303,Marc Thorpe,2013-01-18 11:04:00,621,"jaqcues Paul did use frozen dead minnows Worms or dead bait did not make a diffrence on that day Tks for the explanation  As for dead baiting or idling bait on your tip ups,after last weeknd,It does not surprise me Paul had some set up same way and got some action  Dax, Frabill has been in invloved with my services,my muskie research projects and my educational web show FishFactor.TV along with any others for many years"
