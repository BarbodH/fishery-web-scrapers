Me and a buddy decided we're gonna do the haliburtons one day, i have a couple lakes in mind but generally just looking for some lakes where pike and lakers exist. I dont need to know where there's tons, just where they exist. If you have details on where a couple first time ice laker chasers would likely hook up, i'd certainly appreciate it, but it's not necessary. Thanks!"
759963,SirCranksalot,2013-01-17 13:50:00,3291,It depends---if you are taking lots of gear you'll probably hook up anywhere(ditch by the side of the road)
759997,Rich,2013-01-17 15:40:00,3927,Uhh. K.
760179,deffect,2013-01-17 23:00:00,15,Kushog lake has both pike and lakers. If you can find a map of some sort look for fairly shallow flats near structure/deeper water?
760190,Rich,2013-01-17 23:35:00,3927,"Thanks actually, I fished Kushog as a kid, we stayed at the Ox Narrows often. I kinda forgot about its existence til you reminded me. Thank you very much!"
760195,chris.brock,2013-01-17 23:46:00,4053,"I agree with LH, if both species are important, than Kushog would be the best bet. Lakers may be a little tough on Kushog though.  12 Mile also has both species,  if it's mainly pike you're after, Horseshoe likely has the biggest population.  If you're going to Haliburton, I'd say don't bother with the pike and target lakers, or other trout/ char species"
760361,SirCranksalot,2013-01-18 15:48:00,3291, Aaaah. I wuz jest joshin' yuh!----trying to refer back to the popular thread you started abut fishing gear! Sorry I couldn't  be of help.
