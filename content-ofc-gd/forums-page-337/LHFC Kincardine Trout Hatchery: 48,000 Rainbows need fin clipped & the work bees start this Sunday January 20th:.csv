Anyone who wishes to help would be welcome. Let me know & I'll pass your info on to Al.W. If anyone wishes to help fin clip but at another time please let me know and we can probably work that out. Pass the word to your friends & see if their interested. I would like to get 48,000 fish clipped before January 28th if possible. Thanx & Tight Lines SBK  Picture from last year  "
