759920,EC1,2013-01-17 06:34:00,930,"3/16 when shallow, light cover 3/8 for most pitching 1/2 slightly heavier 1oz can be ok for punching much of the kawarthas"

759986,206,2013-01-17 15:24:00,563, LOL  Thanks for the replys...i'm upgrading my lead pinch on weights for some quality sliding tungsten.  Color really make much difference?
760327,Luke V.,2013-01-18 13:52:00,286,I'm my opinion flat black is best. You want the fish attracted to your bait. Not a shinny sinker
760343,NAW,2013-01-18 14:49:00,4022,X2.  I've only ever used black.
760355,jedimaster,2013-01-18 15:40:00,3472,I just buy the cheap grey ones. drop a bullet weight into the muck and see if can see it. chances are good if you are using them in weeds its a mud bottom and the weight will burry into the silt and color won't mean anything.
760454,MCTFisher9120,2013-01-18 21:42:00,3761,"I have a large assortment of bullet's but to start off go with this. I have all Ultra Tungsten, there a decent price. They make the peg's too that you might need, I like to use them when pitching plastics 1/4oz 3/8oz 1/2oz 3/4oz 1oz  I use 3/8oz and 3/4oz most common but on worms and other baits the little weight's like 1/4oz come out.
