759470,richyb,2013-01-15 16:38:00,774,I got this from the ctv news on facebook    http://www.icontact-archive.com/jkeka-84aTHar11S4Jhd44AMsP0bDlkr?w=1
759472,lew,2013-01-15 16:59:00,12766,Very sad.
759476,BillM,2013-01-15 17:07:00,17367,Just gotta shake your head at that...
759478,TJQ,2013-01-15 17:09:00,7806,Very sad indeed.
759661,pics,2013-01-16 04:57:00,1268,Was he taking a short cut home to meet his buddies?...at 2 am alcohol could be a factor...way too young....sad story..
759662,irishfield,2013-01-16 05:14:00,26272,"A ""short cut"" (cuts a good 2 miles to town walking across the ice there) he's most likely been using, at this time of year, since he was knee high to a grasshopper. Unfortunately Penetang Harbour has numerous springs and there's an open section of water there right now, even though there are huts out on the bay. Condolences to his father and family.  Bill.. guess there was no compassion training in your up bringing."
759688,NAW,2013-01-16 13:08:00,4022,Ya.  This is sad news for sure.  Not a good way to start the new year.
759695,mr blizzard,2013-01-16 13:52:00,1589,"Yes it is very sad turn of events. Condolensces to the family.  Somehow there has to be a better education process for people who venture out on the ice who do not normally spend a lot of time out there. What is common sense to you or I  may never come into their train of thought.  I know we have grilled some rules into our son regarding ice since he was 4, at 17 he still plays by the same rules. It is cheap insurance and gets us all home safe.  Our prayers are with them."
759700,kemper,2013-01-16 14:30:00,2232,"Very sad, and awful for the family.  It would be great if people stopped playing with thin/unsafe ice. If he was a local kid, he probably knew it was a risky crossing with the weather and ice conditions."
759704,irishfield,2013-01-16 14:47:00,26272,"Like I said Kemper.. he lives right there.. and I'm sure knows the ice like the back of his hand. Definitely not a first time crossing, just stepped in the wrong place Monday morning in the dark. 2 funerals attended, for 2 x 19 year olds in 2 weeks... is too much for this old guy!"
759706,kemper,2013-01-16 14:55:00,2232, Too much for any guy Irish.
759839,Cudz,2013-01-17 00:55:00,2652,I taught him and his brother.  Condolences to the family.
759942,Rich,2013-01-17 12:38:00,3927,"I would not walk across the ice in the dark, but then again I haven't grown up knowing that as a winter walking trail. I'd say it's a tragic mishap, nothing more.  Condolensces to the family."
