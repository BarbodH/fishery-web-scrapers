759984,Rod Caster,2013-01-17 15:21:00,5784,Haha good stuff. -25 with a 10 degree wind chill in Nbay this morning. I nearly lost some fingerprints to a piece of metal! Yikes! Love it though... This cold spell should add a couple inches of ice to the snow-barren lakes

760251,NAW,2013-01-18 02:52:00,4022,Cool video Simon.  Reminds me of when I was a hired hand on a farm.  In the winter we would rebuild combines.  I had to clean them first.  The pressure washer was more like an ice blaster on the super cold days..
760321,limeyangler,2013-01-18 13:22:00,5204,Now that would be cool!
760324,aplumma,2013-01-18 13:41:00,6896,About the only good thing about not going metric is F* numbers give the perception it is warmer than it is.    Art
