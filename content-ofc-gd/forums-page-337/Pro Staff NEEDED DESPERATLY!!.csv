758673,TJQ,2013-01-12 21:29:00,7806,Thanks guys.. Ive got more than enough now.. let me sort this out!
758749,DMASSE,2013-01-13 00:48:00,420,"I would be interested as well.  I do alot product testing for a number of companies,  So helping you out would be fun..\  Let me know  Dave"
758871,Steve,2013-01-13 15:12:00,2075,"TJ, i just wanted to THANK YOU for pointing out what PRO STAFF means.  Too many anglers feel ""pro staff"" means professional - heck no.  Most pro staff have less hours on the water than average fisherman, cause they are so busy in bps's, sportsman shows, and the like trying to hawk their goods, while other anglers are on the water 150+ days a year.  PROmotional staff correct. PROfessional staff - maybe five or so guys in this province - maybe.  I think the past recently showing someone's son holding a laker is a great example of PROmotional staff - not PROfessional staff."
758878,kevin booth,2013-01-13 15:48:00,57,"well said steve so true,iam totally into promo staff but you couldnt pay me enough to be a pro staff just for those reasons,i need to be on the water every weekend to keep me insane and thats what i do.the worst part is i promote alot of products out there for free and would love the oppertunity to try some new products without haveing to pay a fortune for them.i can tell you that i should own shares in northland products,but iam now starting to feel like i should be on there promo staff lol."
758921,TJQ,2013-01-13 18:29:00,7806,"Ya.  well to be honest.. I just need pictures and videos of normal guys (not too many around here..lol) using the stuff i sell and getting me pictures/videos of catches, so i can show them with the products im gonna sell.. so yes promotional staff.. maybe more like product boosters...  The majority is gonna be the mainstays of fishing so no new fancy shmancy 10 dollar lures..  not what Im or my store is gonna be about."
758927,lew,2013-01-13 18:53:00,12766,"Hey TJ, hope you've still got the video of Peter winning the pike tourney with the Jumbla.  That was definetly a classic"
758928,BillM,2013-01-13 18:54:00,17367,Don't tell any of the guys over on NPS what pro staff means  :)
758929,Roy,2013-01-13 18:58:00,13728, HA!  Best post yet!
758931,mercman,2013-01-13 19:07:00,7054,I'll give it a shot TJ. The quebec market needs some good tackle suppliers.I'll even promote you on my Local FaceBook Group. Montreal Anglers Club   Paul
758954,Rich,2013-01-13 21:01:00,3927,"""Professional Staff"" seems more like a label for an employee at the store. Haha"
759011,danbouck,2013-01-14 01:26:00,4380,"I have yet to see anyone refer to a prostaff member as ""professional staff""  A lot of people have an issue when they see someone with logos on their shirts and boats, not sure why. If someone wants to help a company promote items that is up to them to do.  By the way, if you get paid working for the company or get paid in a tourney you a professional by definition."
759015,spinnerbaitking,2013-01-14 01:56:00,1622,Lure Whures lol sign me up for a few if needed Tight Lines SBK
759367,michigander fisherman,2013-01-15 03:05:00,64,I would definitely like to take a couple pictures using your lures to promote them. Let me know

759787,camillj,2013-01-16 21:52:00,1988,"OK ...

759790,aplumma,2013-01-16 22:01:00,6896,Do what I did I sent him pictures of all of my nice fish and he said he would stock the lures that are in the picture. Says it will save him money.....   Art
759807,Roy,2013-01-16 23:25:00,13728, I don't think he stocks pork liver and stink baits.
758521,TJQ,2013-01-12 03:00:00,7806,"LOL.. not really.... but i do need a few!  Ok, so my online fishing tackle store is coming along fine.. just about ready to open... But I need pro staff. Upon some investigation I found out that pro staff doesn't really stand for ""professional staff"" like I thought, but actually ""promotional staff""... like what it should be cause most of the ""Pro Staff"" out there really are not actually ""professional"" as they get paid in product for the most part. So I want to get some people to use my lures, and ""promote"" them i.e. take some pictures and tell me what works for them and what doesn't.  I really don't want to use the term ""pro staff"".. cause.... well... I'm me..  So I was thinking I could call my ""promotional staff"" - wait for it.... ""Lure Whures"". Any one got anything better????  "
