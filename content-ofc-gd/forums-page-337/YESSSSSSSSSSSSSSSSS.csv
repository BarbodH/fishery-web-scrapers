759393,krixxer,2013-01-15 04:52:00,274,looks great!
759413,wkrp,2013-01-15 12:44:00,656,The Best!
759483,ketchenany,2013-01-15 17:31:00,3229,It looked amazing and the when I signed in it went back to white
759484,TJQ,2013-01-15 17:34:00,7806,bottom left - change theme....
759490,ketchenany,2013-01-15 18:18:00,3229,"Well I got it right on THIS computer, and I'm not touching anything else. Now for the other two at home, it's a different story, but I'll get it!  Looks really good"
759526,woodenboater,2013-01-15 20:27:00,2277," Yeah, I was wondering about this as well. Just feels a bit unbalanced to my eyes. This entire post and thread 'frame' is shifted to the right and the left is lined up with 'Member Menu"" box at upper left as noted.  Will probably stick to IP.Board theme if it's beyond tweaking although I really like the colour of Aplitex Earth."
759534,Roy,2013-01-15 20:39:00,13728,Quick fix...move your chair to the right.
759555,Spiel,2013-01-15 21:10:00,9065," Hahahaha, you're way to witty my friend."
759578,woodenboater,2013-01-15 21:43:00,2277,but what if I get strange looks from my co-workers when I sidle up beside them
759579,TJQ,2013-01-15 21:45:00,7806, Id bet your co workers are used to strange behaviour...
759584,Fisherman,2013-01-15 21:54:00,7201,"Ya, I have to agree, get rid of the Member menu block at the left.  I tried to move my chair right, I can't, there's a wall, so I moved the computer left and buddy next to me gave me the evil eye.."
759585,woodenboater,2013-01-15 22:02:00,2277,you got that right T.J.
759612,Leecher,2013-01-15 23:43:00,7832,The new skin looks mint    Great job Roy    This calls for a martini on the rocks   even though I don't drink liquor... still  warrants a glass in your honor

759250,kickingfrog,2013-01-14 22:50:00,8333,If you click the ball at the left of the tittle it should take you to the first unread post.
759251,misfish,2013-01-14 22:51:00,29133,"You are not allowed to use that image extension on this community.  Never mind,used to many things.LOL  WORKS  "

759301,Slop,2013-01-15 00:50:00,151,"That was one heckuva blizzard. Everything is perfect, thank you!"
759302,mukluk,2013-01-15 00:53:00,196,It's OK.     But still am missing the old format.   Do not adapt to change as I get older I guess.

759201,jedimaster,2013-01-14 21:52:00,3472,Moocho Better... spacing is still a bit too much but way way easier on the eye balls.
759206,misfish,2013-01-14 21:56:00,29133,"WHAT??????????????????? CAN I CLICK ON THAT NOW?????????????????     GOD SPEAK TO ME,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
759208,Twocoda,2013-01-14 21:56:00,4130,"Now that this is behind us....what are the chances of getting a ""view new content"" at the bottom of the pages so we dont have to scroll all the way back up to the top to hit it?"
759212,Twocoda,2013-01-14 22:02:00,4130,whiner.....lol
759213,misfish,2013-01-14 22:03:00,29133,"Yes,there is a god.  Thanks me brudder. Much better on the eyes."
759214,Rod Caster,2013-01-14 22:04:00,5784,Looks great! A nice earthy brown/green. agree with Sinclair about spacing.
759219,TJQ,2013-01-14 22:14:00,7806,"Thanks Roy, good job... weve got another version like this in the pipe.. we will see what the ""spacing"" is in that one... I dont know that there is much modification we can do to this...  may just have to deal.. Once again, Roy took care of this.. kudos bud."
759220,Roy,2013-01-14 22:16:00,13728,You don't have to scroll back up. At the bottom of the page there's a white arrow in a red button. Just click on that.
759221,Skipper D,2013-01-14 22:18:00,1970,Hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! how did you know i was gona like this ......

759226,lew,2013-01-14 22:21:00,12766," I don't know much about this stuff, but FWIW, I'm using Windows 7 with Google Chrome and my zoom is set at 100 % and my spacing is perfect with no scrolling or anything else required."
759227,Christopheraaron,2013-01-14 22:22:00,3525,"nevermind, found it"
759228,Roy,2013-01-14 22:23:00,13728,"Nah, you might just have to go to the bottom of the page and select the ""Aplitexearth"" skin."
759232,kickingfrog,2013-01-14 22:26:00,8333,"Last time I did that, things went kabluey, so you understand my hesitation."
759235,misfish,2013-01-14 22:27:00,29133,IT WORKS ROB. IM HAPPY.. PASS THE SIPPY CUP.
