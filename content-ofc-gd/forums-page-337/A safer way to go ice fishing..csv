760157,LuresAndTours,2013-01-17 21:56:00,1,"Yes, the Argo is Amazing. RMC Argo Beaverton zipped media around using the ARGO at the Canadian Ice Fishing Championship last year when Roy and his son were volunteering. Top speeds of 35 km/h made the 3 to 5 km runs out to the fishing zone a breeze, taking out 4 adults and their gear, including reporters and their video cameras. Having the protection of the canopy was welcome shelter from the high winds and bitter cold of Day One (February 25, 2012). Day Two was a totally different outlook, with more risk of sunburn than anything else. Did you see the footage and pics? There is a slide show  - not sure how to post it tho. We also have summer  video of it in the water -truly amazing amphibian! "
