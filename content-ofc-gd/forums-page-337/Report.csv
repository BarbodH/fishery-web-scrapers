759151,TDunn,2013-01-14 18:42:00,680,"Hey OFC!  Now that the holidays are over, I found some time to sit down and write up a report. Our Fall Here in the Soo was wet, cold and windy. Prime steelhead weather.... October alone brought 5 inches of rain and 6 inches of snow. November was much the same.  With this much precipitation on each trip north on Superior tribs, I was welcomed with prime water almost each time. Fishing was steady with consistent numbers on each trip but it was tough to anticipate a big run of fish with the water high all season.   I fished roe, beads (both single and tandem rigs), jigs and pinkies on occasion. An orange bead, pegged 1.5-2” above my roe bag was my best producer. I noticed chartreuse was highly recommended on the board this fall and will be messing around with that colour in 2013. Threw a bit of hardware but stuck with the float rod for the most part this fall.  No Superior giants this fall but lots of fish like this...       I finally pulled Ted out of his tree stand and we hit the St. Marys for our one and only trip of the fall. It was only for a couple hours but once we figured out where and what they wanted....it was a fish a drift. Had the GoPro on for the first half hour we were out trolling and killed the battery. We did get one fish on film but missed out on some serious action!  Started the afternoon off with this trolling http://s490.photobucket.com/albums/rr266/TDunn84/?action=view&current=GOPR0326.mp4  switched up spots and technique             Ted ended the afternoon with nice steelie!      I made one more trip up north to Superior tribs and it was getting fairly locked up!      I then concentrated my efforts on the rapids whenever I could get out. Short days and then busy holidays doesn’t make for a ton of time on the water. Not to my standards anyway lol! I didn't hit any big number outings but they all had fish involved which was great!      A little video of a steelhead landed in the rapids  http://s490.photobucket.com/albums/rr266/TDunn84/?action=view&current=002-2.mp4  Atlantics were around also....Not big ones but fish like this.   Ice fishing has started off not to bad considering the mild winter we are having again. Ive been chasing whites and perch at a few local haunts. 10-15 minutes from my doorstep.           Ted with a 14 1/4""   I cant fit it all my ice fishing pics from this year into this report so I'll save the rest for next time!  Good luck this winter and be careful on the ice!!!   TDunn"
