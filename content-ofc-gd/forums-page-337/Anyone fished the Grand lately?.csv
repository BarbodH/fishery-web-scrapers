759030,pics,2013-01-14 03:43:00,1268,The water will still be high and muddy..... http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cfm?Sec=2&Sub1=6&Sub2=4

759635,Rich,2013-01-16 02:07:00,3927,Before the thaw brought it into turbulent chocolate milk... I fished around the ice booms as best I could through the brantford stretch.. notta. I have definitely had good winter days there though. I'd wait til it settles.
759641,hotsky,2013-01-16 02:52:00,400,"I went to the Harbour instead, verry murky water no visability. Fished by the Desjardines canal and Pier 4 and no luck. Met a guy there he said he tried LaSale earlier today and got skuncked."

759655,hotsky,2013-01-16 04:03:00,400,"I'm uptodate on the regs. pike, trout, carp is what I was after."
759657,solopaddler,2013-01-16 04:22:00,8605," Well you mentioned Caledonia in your original post. Based on your species of choice, once again you may want to check the reg's."
