758492,Rod Caster,2013-01-12 00:43:00,5784,"Thursday was a gorgeous day. -2 Celsius with low winds and some bluebird skies. Joey, Sarah and I went for some splake action (inspired by Joey's report) and tallied very well, with 20 fish hitting the ice. Most of them were fairly small, but we kept 7 for the frying pan...one of which is sitting in my belly as I type this.  Here are some photos and funny video. Hope you laugh and enjoy. Remember, we are laughing with her.        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8xWul79qjk"

759152,fishnsled,2013-01-14 18:45:00,3520,"Always easier to laugh at someone's mishap rather than your own....thankfully there is no video of mine.      Nice report Chad, looks like an awesome day to be on the ice."
759469,SirCranksalot,2013-01-15 16:27:00,3291,That Sarah looks like a good sport! She must be a keeper.  Jeremy----maybe you can find 1 like that!
759493,Rod Caster,2013-01-15 18:28:00,5784,"A great sport! Out of 4 days we had off together, she agreed to fish for 3 of them! She really likes the taste of trout, so that helped a lot...as did the mild weather.  Sarah has a few cute, single friends here Jeremy"
759675,solopaddler,2013-01-16 10:55:00,8605,HA! Good stuff. I was half expecting the fish to squirm out of her hands and back down the hole after she dropped it the first time.
759681,mercman,2013-01-16 12:41:00,7054,That made me chuckle Chad ! Thanks for the report. Looks like fun
759925,Marc Thorpe,2013-01-17 10:30:00,621,"Nice RC,very colorful splake"
