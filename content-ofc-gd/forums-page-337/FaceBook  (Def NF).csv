759494,TJQ,2013-01-15 18:29:00,7806,"OK..  First the announcement..  http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/speculation-rife-ahead-of-facebook-s-mystery-announcement-1.1114843  Now... my prediction..  I'd bet $$ its a search engine....Last year (or so) when Google came out with Google+ it was a direct hit at Facebook.  Facebook didn't have a search engine that went much outside of Facebook, and now Google was aiming directly at them with all of Googles muscle (Google + which is for most a failure.)Ya see I've been saying for years that all FB had to do to take on Google is enable a search... or even partner with Bing...Now we see FB on our users list spidering us when we've never seen it index our site before...If you want to do an internet search .. you have to leave Facebook to do it.  If they can come up with a good search engine, (and now that Google has really pissed off a bunch of webmasters just like me) I wont hesitate to use it instead.Cause then they can.. #1 highlight Facebook pages like mine in their results (keeping people on Facebook, generating more $$) then serve their own results, #2 as well as selling ads on the side which is the MAIN source of Googles revenue.Ive been saying for a couple of years now that gGoogle has to be careful.. and I think FB is about to take a shot back...Also.. you make a tablet or a phone... you ""build"" a search engine.This is my prediction!!  Glad I've been putting lots of effort into FB.  I know its not fishing, but this stuff is unfortunately important to me and should be to anyone whose in business..  It will be interesting to see if I'm right."
