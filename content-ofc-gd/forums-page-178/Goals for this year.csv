912119,mike rousseau,2015-04-24 16:08:00,4661,"I really wanna break 55"" on a musky... Came close last year at 54.25""  And I'd like to break my PB for carp at 36lb 12oz... That one has been lingering around for like 6 years...  And always looking for that local 14lb Walter for my wall... I lost one meeting that criteria a few years ago and it still haunts my dreams... Gotta be local 14lb tho... Right now 12lb is my PB...  Those goals have been going for a few years now  New goal is finding crappie by boat... All the spots I know are from shore and I hate shore fishing with 20 other slobs fighting me for a spot...  Also entering a pike tournament next weekend for the first time... Top 10 would be cool for that...  And #1 on my list is winning the annual summer walleye tourny in Lancaster Ontario... I've been fishing it for like 10 years... Never won it... Got second place 3 years straight now... Missed by 1oz 2 summers ago... That hurt..."
912127,Acountdeleted,2015-04-24 16:55:00,2562,Oh yeah! I want a gar too.  And any fish on the fly.
912144,NAW,2015-04-24 19:05:00,4022,I want to put my girlfriend on a big fat fish.  Any species will do!  Preferably a 40+ pike.  But beggars can't be choosers!
912158,porkpie,2015-04-24 20:04:00,2521,"Get out there, I won't even fish on a weekend.  There has to be some benefit to shift work, and quiet launch ramps and few people on the water is one of them!"
912166,netminder,2015-04-24 20:50:00,514,My goal is to get out as much as possible to justify my spending and see if my sudden obsession with fish will carry over to next spring when I hopefully have enough saved up to afford a boat.
912267,Sinker,2015-04-25 03:07:00,8692,"Im off every other wed/thurs, and dont start until 1pm fridays. If your ever up this way, or want to come this way, get in touch! Finding a weekday fishing partner aint easy!!  S."

912286,pics,2015-04-25 11:31:00,1268,I'd just like to get out fishing more... a moose with the bow would be nice as well..
912287,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-25 11:52:00,2582,I'm aiming for 100 plus days on the water. I like that one the best Bruce. Makes me miss my old continental shifts though. Back in the 90's I did that on Lake Simcoe alone in a year...forget about where ever else I fished. Working Monday to Friday SUCKS.
912318,fishindevil,2015-04-25 17:06:00,6254,A few years ago I fished like 13 new lakes in one summer !!! I have since re-visited at least half if them and pulled big smallies & largies from them!!! So in gonna fish a few more and do a bass tourney on a new lake as well this summer so my goal is to do well and learn another few lakes up north and get both 5-6lb smallies & buckets. !!!  And cash a cheque I hope )
912359,Craigson,2015-04-26 00:07:00,117, Guess I need another new goal. Break 10lbs w a steelie?? We'll see   
912500,sofabed,2015-04-27 01:36:00,119,I hope to catch a 4+ lb small or large mouth bass on Balsam lake. I hear they are in the lake however in 3 years of fishing Balsam I have not caught a big bass on it.
912522,fishindevil,2015-04-27 09:47:00,6254,
912637,sofabed,2015-04-27 22:50:00,119,Thanks for the advice fishindevil. I can use all the help I can get.
912639,Rich Clemens,2015-04-27 23:09:00,3131,"Same as last year, and the year before, and the year before that, and .......  Oh well. Land my first 50"" class musky."
912672,PBenson,2015-04-28 01:36:00,154,"50+ inch musky on LSC, catch a species of shark that I have not got yet (Bull, Hammer, Tiger, or Spinner), and to catch a big pike."
912713,ken wasik,2015-04-28 11:45:00,9,"My weekends are Tuesday to Friday. Very quiet on the water, nobody ripping around in their boat. fish where and for as long as I want. Love It."
912739,Acountdeleted,2015-04-28 14:15:00,2562,"It's funny too, my goals have changed since friends and girlfriends have gotten into fishing.  I want to see DynamicBear get a Muskie I want to see my girlfriend (soon to be posting under username 'laughing my bass off') get a Muskie. I'd love to see a sturgeon caught.  Oh and I want to put my sister on some big bass."
912941,Raycaster,2015-04-29 15:25:00,528,"1) I'd like to get comfortable with LSC and hone my planar board skills. 2) Help my buddy catch his first musky, he's driving me crazy. 3) Become a better Fall fisherman, being skunked every Fall is embarrassing. 4) If I happen to find my favorite rod/reel I left at the bottom of Balsam last year.... well I'd be a happy camper."
912971,CRUD150,2015-04-29 19:09:00,87,"Flow ice still blocking the harbor mouth, couldn't launch the boat so my son and I tried some beach fishing. Nice female for him, nice snack and some quality roe for the stream opener. Male for Dad, released. Goal is to share many more days like this together."

911847,Craigson,2015-04-23 11:10:00,117,"Im going for my first true Steelie on my 'pin. Caught a little shaker last year but was hardly enough to bend the rod.  Another goal is to get to a certain backwoods pike lake in search of a 40"" fish."
911871,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-23 13:10:00,937,Carp on the fly.  Bows on hardbaits.  Top water bass.
911875,ken wasik,2015-04-23 13:18:00,9,"Have a new shift at work. Work Sat, Sun, Mon, 12hr shifts, off Tues to Friday. My goal is to really hit the bass and perch in the Magnettawan. Lots of pike and pickerel in river too. Left my boat up north for the winter.(won't do that again). I also want to learn the lakes close to the GTA. Some info on this would be very helpful."
911877,AKRISONER,2015-04-23 13:24:00,5558,"I started participating in OFC last August and since that time a few very generous friendly knowledgeable members have provided more guidance than any person could ask for.  The interesting thing for me is that I can pin point the exact day that my fishing addiction went off the charts and that was the day that after long discussions about tactics and presenations, I caught my first top water Georgian Bay Smallmouth. From that day I have been fully addicted to fishing.  The best part is that 2 of my great friends are also enthusiastic about fishing and feeding off of eachother our passion for fishing has grown even more. Collectively we have agreed on a set of goals for this season.  1. a 4+lb smallie or a 5lb largie 2. Kawarthas Musky 35"" or more 3. Personally, a 15+lb northern."

911882,Acountdeleted,2015-04-23 13:34:00,2562,Carp.  I'm pretty easy.  I wanted a whitefish too but I buggered that one up.
911887,MCTFisher9120,2015-04-23 13:52:00,3761,"Got a few for this season, first is the same as every Spring. Goal is to catch 4 or 5 nice rainbow's on the small flatfish/quikfish & spinners using my spinning outfit, always a blast fishing 5 or 6 days after opener and catching trout on reaction baits...no bobber watching for me so this might not be as easy to do but I like the challenge.  Second goal is to of course break the PB Largemouth, need a 7lb largemouth to do this.  Third goal is to break my smallmouth PB out on those small lakes I fish every summer, had one close to 5lbs, went to stoney weeks later and got one a 1/4lb over 5 was stoked but still want to break the 5lb Smallmouth mark on my lakes, should make for a fun August/September when I make my 2 week and 1 week trips this summer.  And the last goal is to have a successful Musky opener on Scugog. Taking the old man and my uncle out for a day of trolling and casting, got some smaller Musky baits should be a good challenge we got the equipment so always love a new challenge."
