913525,bigugli,2015-05-04 01:07:00,6138,So far we have not seen too many yet.
913527,Joey,2015-05-04 01:14:00,9122,I hear it is going to be a bad year.  I'm almost afraid to go to my fave photography sites now
913534,Sinker,2015-05-04 02:16:00,8692,"I've had dogs all my life, and only seen one tick ever, and that was last summer on my chocolate lab. He also passed away last summer. I don't blame the tick, just found it ironic.  Nasty critters. I hope I never get one on me.  S."
913535,manitoubass2,2015-05-04 02:20:00,11391,Youve never had a woodtick?  Ive had thousands living up here.  30 a day is pretty common on an early summer bush excursion  Ive had 4 already. Many more too come
913552,Sinker,2015-05-04 12:58:00,8692,"Nope. Never. Only seen the one, and it was on my dog. This area doesn't have many. I spend a lot of time in the woods too.  S."
913559,manitoubass2,2015-05-04 14:22:00,11391,Wow that would be nice!  They are quite the nuassance
913567,mosquito,2015-05-04 15:16:00,111,"As anicdotal , not suggested as reliable, B1 vitamin seems to discourage them.  I used it one year visiting my relatives in Minnesota where even with strong DEET you got ate by mosquitoes and it seemed to help some with the mosquitoes.  At sunset they mosquitoes rose like clouds and strong Deet and the B1 change it to slow Macarana instead of slap dancing.  We went to an Uncles cottage and got stuck in the pine sand on the way back to it.  So I was hot and thirsty and cut across the meadow and my Dad stayed to the road, later I also walked over to the creek to try casting a few flies.  Now to the point... my Dad had stopped taking the B1, he had 3 ticks and all had bit, by the end of the day I had removed 75 and none had bit.  I was taking 300mg in the morning and evening for a couple days before I went there so it was in the sweat.   If you can't avoid them it MIGHT be worth a try for a week or two to see if it works (how ever long a bottle lasts)."
913569,Joey,2015-05-04 15:24:00,9122,"I've never gotten one on me or my dog ever, never seen one.  Guess I've been lucky!!"
913578,manitoubass2,2015-05-04 16:17:00,11391, It is anecdotal as studies suggest it doesnt work.  But try it yourself(b complex is good take take daily regardless)  And see how well it works.  Which reminds me I better start taking mine again lol
913594,fishnsled,2015-05-04 18:29:00,3520,"I've never gotten one on me or my dog ever, never seen one.  Guess I've been lucky!! I've never had to deal with them or seen one either.  Looks like it maybe the norm soon.  I'm guessing the banning of all of the pesticides and herbicides has helped the tick to reproduce more??  (Or maybe global warming??  Someone had to say it.  ) Thanks for the tip on the supplements M and MB2."
913603,manitoubass2,2015-05-04 19:14:00,11391,Theyve always been thick up in nw ontario.  Never seen one when i lived in edmonton or gande prarie. Then again they dont even have mosquitos
913610,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-04 19:57:00,937,"I got my first one ever on saturday trekking the river, it turned me off from fishing"
913612,misfish,2015-05-04 20:04:00,29133,"Why no matter how cold or hot, when Im walking rivers through the bush,I always wear my hoodie with log sleeves. It does get hot,but best way for me any ways, to keep them off the skin. Always have a hat on as well. Not sure that will 100% prevent one attaching to me,but been working so far.  BITE BACK ROLOF"
913666,Blue Lk,2015-05-05 01:03:00,337,"Simon,we have had excellent results with Advantix,a couple of years now & the dogs have been tick free.We used to use flea & tic collars but found Advantix to work better."
913705,dave524,2015-05-05 11:25:00,4508,"Our vet started Elsa on Revolution in April, maybe similar to Advantix, controls a number of nasties. There was some fleas when we gave her a home last August, we gave her a few treatments then and I found a few dead ones when brushing her so it does work.  https://www.revolution4dogs.com/"
913730,captpierre,2015-05-05 13:51:00,2521,"K9Advantix is the way to go. Revolution is not great for ticks -although great for everything else. There are also oral medications that are effective. Can't depend on flea/tick collars. New info suggests they are also potentially toxic  Hotspots for Lyme disease is the north shores of Erie and Lake O.  Especially Long Point, Prince Edward County, Kingston and up the St Lawrence. Nasty disease. Be careful. You and your dog."
913732,dave524,2015-05-05 14:11:00,4508,"K9Advantix is the way to go. Revolution is not great for ticks -although great for everything else. There are also oral medications that are effective. Can't depend on flea/tick collars. New info suggests they are also potentially toxic   Thanks for that info capt, our vet usually refers to it as heartworm medication . I've never had a tick in my yard here in 31 years but Elsa does like to run with the pack at the local dog park and she was a rescue initially , so the heartworm  is a plus for me.  To get rid of the fleas in the house  I spread Borax on the carpeting , worked it in with a broom and vacuumed a few days later, lot cheaper than the specialty product at the pet store."
