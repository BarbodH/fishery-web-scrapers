913221,icceman,2015-05-01 10:48:00,36,Morning all.  Will be heading out Sunday for the first time this spring.  Hoping to catch a few yellow bellies.  Wondering if I should head to my winter spots.  I usually fish around snake island area.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Not asking for anyones spot just a general direction.  Thanks
