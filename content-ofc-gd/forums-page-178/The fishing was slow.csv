Surface temps were as high as 13 Celsius. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPyZJBsvOKE&feature=youtu.be  Besides some initial instructions I've been trying to let him do it on his own. I didn't even say anything about the jazz hands finish. Last night when I uploaded the video to the computer though Ryan saw it and said ""What am I doing with my hand?"" So some refinement might be coming.  Driving the boat:   Had a musky and a pike follow a 2 inch minnow bait in one back bay. Ryan had a ""big"" bass on his tiny tube jig until it wrapped in the wood. Some catfish, turtles, otter and a pair of mink."

913644,kickingfrog,2015-05-04 23:23:00,8333,Ya except for the thing with the left hand it is a little startling how much he looks like me.  I'd really like to talk to whom ever put mother's day during spring fishin'.
