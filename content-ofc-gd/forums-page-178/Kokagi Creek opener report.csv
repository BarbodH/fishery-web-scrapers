We had to drag Teagan out because he's not interested in panfish or finicky salmonids, he likes the toothy critters.    A few fish, nice Hawk Air hat    quite a few OOS smallies, a couple sips    My brother had the big score of the day, a quiet moment, tobacco laid and he has a souvenir.    I took this home. I thought it was too beefy to be a deer femur. After looking online, pretty sure it's a deer femur. I'm going to put it in the park by my house after dark to see if it causes a big freak out.    A little butt muncher said he wants to come out next year.  "
