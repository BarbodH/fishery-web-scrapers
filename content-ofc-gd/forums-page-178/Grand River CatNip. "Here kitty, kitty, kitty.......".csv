Timing is everything and with the past weeks temps I figured it would be a little on the tough side but the sunshine and a little guess work the four of us managed our first Erie Cats and personal bests. Always good to see fish.  We'll be back in two weeks and plan on making good on surpassing those numbers. Would like to thank FisherPete for sharing his knowledge with us.    Heres a short clip ;   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuaKb5GvvvY
