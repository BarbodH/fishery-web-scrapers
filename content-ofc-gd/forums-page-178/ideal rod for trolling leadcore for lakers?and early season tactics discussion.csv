905020,smitty55,2015-03-20 23:49:00,928,"I used to use, and still have, a Depth O Plug that gives you the temp and depth in one shot. It was invaluable when I started fishing Lakers as it gave me a good depth to troll at . Specially in the heat of summer.  Cheers"
905136,4x4bassin,2015-03-21 14:55:00,1025,"I""d bet surface temps will be right around the right temp then. Your graph will tell you that. If not, it will only be a few feet down to find the colder water. That time of year, fish are looking for warmer water.....where in summer, they're looking for colder water. Your thinking backwards. If you have a portable graph that tells temp, sometimes you can just drop the transducer down a few feet and see the change in temp.  The north shore of a lake gets the most sun, therefore warms up earlier than the south shore, which is shaded.  As well as the north part of the lake getting the most sun it is mostly sheltered from cold prevailing NW winds . Also lake trout will eat anything so in the spring just after ice out they will be cruising around these warm bays picking off everything from sunfish to leaches . They have a big appetite in the spring ."
905138,solopaddler,2015-03-21 15:04:00,8605,fwiw the north end of Dayo in behind those islands was a great spot for us last spring.

905150,123chadder,2015-03-21 16:51:00,165,fwiw the north end of Dayo in behind those islands was a great spot for us last spring. at the very north end of the lake in that bay?or before that?  http://travelingluck.com/North+America/Canada/Ontario/_5935902_Dayohessarah+Lake.html  http://canada.realty-world.info/map-d111.html
905154,solopaddler,2015-03-21 17:28:00,8605,at the very north end of the lake in that bay?or before that?   Right here. Flatlining all over this entire area was very productive.  (For those that don't know this is a fly in lake  )  
905161,123chadder,2015-03-21 18:23:00,165,Cool I thought that's what you were talking about Thanx

904702,Headhunter,2015-03-19 18:15:00,5703,"To get deeper, just use a snap weight where your leader and the core meet. HH"
904704,Old Man,2015-03-19 18:20:00,822,"We just use 6 1/2 foot Medium Heavy Berkley Lighting Rods with a Garcia 5500LC spooled with 30lb Power Pro.  Early in the season around here, we troll at moderate speed with line weights and a heavy spoon.  Later in the season, to go deeper, we troll faster using Dipsy Divers or Pink Ladies with a 3 to 4  foot leader and a spoon. Had great luck with #3 Lucky Strike Canoes in Pearl.  "
904707,Joeytier,2015-03-19 18:28:00,3990,"Early season tactic?  Don't use leadcore for one thing.  I like flatlining smaller gangtrolls with your favorite flutter spoon 2-3 feet back.  On a lake im unfamiliar with I will just troll the shoreline until I find what I'm looking for, which is usually boulder flats in 15-30 fow.  Last summer we never saw surface temps over 70 so nothing heavier than a 3 oz bottom bouncer was necessary, but that can get me down 40+ feet slow trolling with braid.  Lot more fun catching 2 pound Lakers on a light casting outfit and a small weight than a telephone pole with 10 tons of cable on it lol"

904711,chris.brock,2015-03-19 18:50:00,4053,Early season= flat lining  I like heavier spoons like a Cleo or Cyclops. Trolling in around 15 FOW over soft bottom flats and around rocky points.
904713,BillM,2015-03-19 18:55:00,17367,"Like it's been mentioned, early season = shallow and planner boards.   Get those baits off to the side of the boat and way back."
904716,Freshtrax,2015-03-19 19:16:00,2215,A two colour setup might be deadly on simcoe early season.   On smaller lakes no need.

904720,123chadder,2015-03-19 19:36:00,165,"also,we will be about 2+ weeks from ice out so fish will be a tad deeper i imagine"

The first week after ice out they seem scattered all over the water column and I end up jigging my winter spots in 70 FOW for marginal results.  Last year, the May 24 weekend was prime for flat lining lakers in Haliburton.  What area are you headed to?"
904814,Joeytier,2015-03-20 01:16:00,3990,"Yep, I prefer a few weeks after ice out myself too.  If the waters less than 55 on top, then they definitely wont necessarily be pushing deep"

904820,123chadder,2015-03-20 01:25:00,165,the first two vids mike borger made
904823,Consigliere,2015-03-20 01:38:00,121,In dec and jan this year did well trolling reef runners and taildancers on leads from 40-180ft on planers on the larry. Averaged about 8 lbs or so and most action between 15-35ft trolling between 1.5 and 3 mph  Haven't tried that area after ice out but will be this year!  Don't see too much need for lead core or weights early season but you never know. If you know they are in the area it's just figuring out depth and speed.
904898,4x4bassin,2015-03-20 15:11:00,1025,"I spend a lot of time on the water from May till October chasing lake trout and I can tell you from experience that this early in the season there is no need for a lead core setup . The magic water temperature for lake trout is around 50 - 55 degrees so find that and you will have all the lakers you need . Where you are going I would imagine the surface water temp. wouldn't be much more then the preferred water temp. for the lake trout , putting them in the top 20 feet of water .  Like Bill said , if you can you should be going out from the boat at this time of year with planner boards instead of deep or a long line . If you want to go deep there are some better options for this time of year and that being a 1 oz inline weight ( will get a spoon to 30-40ft on a troll ) or something like a deep taildancer from rapala (20-25ft) That is plenty deep enough when the surface temp. is in the 55-58 degree range. Another thing to remember is lake trout are not the smartest fish to swim but have great eyesight and feed up so they will chase your lure from 30 feet down no problem when aggressive and water clarity is good . One of my favorite patterns for early in the year is to head to the northern part of the lake and fish the bays and sheltered areas first . Reason for this is that this area warms up first and brings life to that part of the lake starting the cycle and of course the lake trout are on the top of this cycle feeding on all this new life . If you hit it right this pattern can produce big time . We actually stumbled on this situation by accident on a lake we fish and it produces year in and year out . Good luck , looks like its going to be a great time"

904933,smitty55,2015-03-20 17:50:00,928,"I use leadcore almost exclusively with big gang trolls. A long rod helps a lot, not only to spread lines apart and help the fight, but to aid in netting fish if you are fishing alone. One more thing, 28lb line goes deeper than the 45lb due to it's narrower profile. The strength of the line is in the braid, not the lead core.  Cheers"

904940,Sinker,2015-03-20 18:10:00,8692,"I prefer to flatline them too. More fun, and just as effective that time of year. Diving cranks work great once you have the depth dialed in.
