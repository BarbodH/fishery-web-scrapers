913199,Pigeontroller,2015-05-01 02:49:00,2793,"I've discovered a new hobby, keeps me busy in the garage tinkering...And out Flea Marketing with my Wife!  Cleaning and refurbishing old Coleman Lanterns...    There are millions of Coleman Lanterns out there, dating back to the early part of the last century, many different models, the date of manufacture is usually stamped on the bottom.    If anyone has any old ones kicking around collecting dust, I'd gladly take them off your hands, for cash...Or trade for fishing gear!"
913204,irishfield,2015-05-01 03:18:00,26272,Is that a boob cup.. lol  I have a few in camp in the work shed... I'll see what vintage they are when and if we get there this summer.

913278,bigbuck,2015-05-01 17:36:00,2449,"Just fired mine up on the weekend to make sure it still works. Other than mantles, it has been trouble free for 25 years. Sooo much better than the propane ones now."
913284,adempsey,2015-05-01 17:50:00,1498,Very nice.  Definitely a unique hobby.  The ones you refurbished look brand new.
913285,bare foot wader,2015-05-01 18:10:00,1354,those are very nice....you flip them or just collect? there is a bit of a niche market for old colemans  those old lanterns sure beat the new stuff they have out now
913292,davey buoy,2015-05-01 19:32:00,5505,"I have a 30 plus year old one I probably haven't used in 10 years.Has a nice metal case as well.I would never sell that one,looks brand new as well. Nice job on the ones you brought back to life.Nice hobby!!"

913364,johnb,2015-05-02 12:32:00,15,I used to belong to a hunt camp that had a coleman lantern from the 50s. It was a CPR lantern that used kerosene. Was in great shape and probably used to this day. Strangely enough it worked on the same principal as the naptha lanterns of today. I didnt think kerosene was volitile enough.
