913608,huzzsaba,2015-05-04 19:56:00,884,I use to go fishing with my granduncle back in the days (20 years or so ago) when I was a little boy.  He lived in sault ste marie at that time and I remember leaving home before sunrise and fishing from a pier or something like that.  It was so long a go that I don't remember when I look it up on google maps as things have changed since then.  The spot was a public spot where and there is a proper parking place and people fished from the pier and from shore alongside the pier.  I would love to go visit this spot when I visit the area in July.  I remember my dad caught something every time he cast from that spot.

I will be staying at the sleep Inn close to the water and close to the Art Gallery of Algoma.  is fishing along the waters behind the art gallery allowed? I believe there is a trail that runs along the river.  Thanks"
