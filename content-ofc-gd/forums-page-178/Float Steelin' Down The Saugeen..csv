913476,FloatnFly,2015-05-03 17:54:00,1640,can't say im not jealous! would love to do that with fly rod in hand!
913479,Beavertail,2015-05-03 18:11:00,331,Looks like a great way to spend the day. Wonder what was the fate of that Red-Tail?
913508,SirCranksalot,2015-05-03 23:12:00,3291,"I have been wanting to float part of that river for see time now but haven't overcome the hurdle of a car shuttle. What section of the river did you do, or is that a secret?  It really looks beautiful along there with the sand banks etc  thx"
913510,fishindevil,2015-05-03 23:16:00,6254,Looks like a great trip and  very nice scenery !!!
913528,chris.brock,2015-05-04 01:15:00,4053,That looks like a blast. I love paddling those rivers with a quick pace and no nasty spots.
913539,Moosebunk,2015-05-04 05:53:00,3970,"So thats what it looks like . SWEET.  Those toons are totally stoked. I,ll bet they are not cheap.  Loved watching the drift through your eyes bud.  Thought of you and Terry a couple times while out there.  Belly boat float buddies.  Guessed you'd dig this report Brian.  And those toons... I didn't even ask price.  Lenny only owns the best in everything, he totally disgusts me dood. lol.  Looks like a great way to spend the day. Wonder what was the fate of that Red-Tail?  Redtail died of a little buckshot to the belly.  Rather fresh kill.  Turkey opened day before, guess some dummy couldn't tell the difference.  I cut feathers off for myself and the lads but misplaced mine somewhere on the trip.  Bummer cause, we got one serious dreamcatcher over the head of the bed, and I thought the hawk feathers would be a great addition with the osprey.  Eagle and owl to come later.  What section of the river did you do, or is that a secret?  No worries.  Put in at Walkerton but got out somewhere quite a ways down.  Not past Paisley though.  Lotsa friggin' river to roam that's for sure."
913540,solopaddler,2015-05-04 09:23:00,8605,"Looks like fun! Had considered floating it myself on the Sunday of the opener but bailed because the numbers of fish that passed through the lift at Denny's was pretty low.  (also fwiw it's a Huron trib, not a Georgian Bay trib )"
913558,netminder,2015-05-04 14:17:00,514," Yeah, to properly do it justice all the way from Walkerton to Southampton you need at least two days. Last time I did we stopped in Paisley the first night at the campground. Starting anywhere further upstream towards Hanover or Durham is a waste of time. You'd end up portaging further than boating."
913580,Beavertail,2015-05-04 16:31:00,331,"That's what I thought, brutal. I'm sure the ignorant slob who shot it knew the difference, but didn't care. Good luck with the dream catcher, sounds neat!"
913585,Ralph Field,2015-05-04 17:12:00,1018,Looks like a great trip and very nice scenery !!! x2
913606,davey buoy,2015-05-04 19:51:00,5505,"What a nice piece of paradise Drew. Could only imagine the fun,you guys did it right !!!!"
913607,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-04 19:55:00,937,Wow... I never been but that place looks amazing
913751,Ven-Pisc-ator,2015-05-05 15:58:00,39,That looks like a great trip.  Lots of fun no doubt.  Some great pix.Ven
913767,SirCranksalot,2015-05-05 18:11:00,3291,"Yeah, to properly do it justice all the way from Walkerton to Southampton you need at least two days.  I think it takes 2 days just paddling, Mike. I've float down the Notty here and only covered 5-6 km in a day of fishing(wasn't a really long day, mind you)"
913768,Steelheadphycho,2015-05-05 18:16:00,470,That'd be a blast!  Another great report/ pics  Thanks Bunk!
913907,Moosebunk,2015-05-06 01:49:00,3970,"bailed because the numbers of fish that passed through the lift at Denny's was pretty low.  it's a Huron trib, not a Georgian Bay trib   Geeesh!  Wished I had of known that... ON BOTH accounts. lol.  That's what I thought, brutal. I'm sure the ignorant slob who shot it knew the difference, but didn't care. Good luck with the dream catcher, sounds neat!  Bit of buck in the belly.  Good news... I found the feathers. Stuffed then in my flyrod tube for transport but forgot.  Showed Bren at home here (she LOVES feathers) and got, ""you only brought home two?""  She's right man, I should have trimmed the entire lot off.   and only covered 5-6 km in a day of fishing(wasn't a really long day, mind you)  Float-tubing down rivers in the past like the Moose & Attawapiskat I'd say it usually took in those slower summertime flows about 3-4 hours to cover 5-7km's.  Makes for a great day.   Thanks all."
