913422,manitoubass2,2015-05-03 00:45:00,11391,"All fish came on black grubs but the bigger pike, that was on a clown subwalk.  I hope its nicer tomorrow so i can get some pics. It was raining so no camera today which is a bummer. Really wanted a pic of my first fish outta there.  Im gonna put a picnic table and firepit down there  Wicked nice place to hang out and chill. Water levels are a lil low right now though the banks are super muddy"
913461,Nipfisher,2015-05-03 14:51:00,2449,Some smaller minnow style cranks or spinners may get you some more of the small pike for fun. But there has to be a few bigguns in there.
913464,manitoubass2,2015-05-03 16:11:00,11391,We will find out!!!
913466,i2cool2fool,2015-05-03 16:24:00,349,
913468,manitoubass2,2015-05-03 16:27:00,11391,"Thanks man!  Yip we sure will!  Ill still be fishing rainy river/rainy lake/lotw. But its awesome to have this in your backyard.  Even if ya just have an hour you can walk down for a quick fish, thats awesome.  There is barely any current too so its a lil safer for the kiddos.  When we bass fish the rapids i have to watch the kids like a hawk lol"
913474,bigugli,2015-05-03 17:45:00,6138,Nothing like having a wee honey hole right in your backyard.
913477,manitoubass2,2015-05-03 17:54:00,11391,Especially finding out whats in there.  Thats the real fun part
913538,Moosebunk,2015-05-04 05:42:00,3970,Can't see the pics at work but it reads like... you're onto something there.
913542,solopaddler,2015-05-04 09:54:00,8605,Nice backyard! I would assume that creek flows into the Rainy River. It should be an early season hotspot! Beyond that things could get tough if the water drops and gets too warm. Glad to hear you found a couple.
913560,manitoubass2,2015-05-04 14:25:00,11391,Yip Mike.  Where im fishing is maybe 1000 yards or so upstream
913331,manitoubass2,2015-05-02 01:25:00,11391,"Well, we moved into a new home december.  Big bonus is that rainy river is still a hop skip and a jump from our front door step.  But...we have a small river about 300 yards from our backyard?  Im not sure what took me so long but +23 temps and no wind made me venture out today.  Now, previously ive asked the locals and all said no fish, dont bother.  So I go down this even to wash some lures, no expectations. Navionics days 7 fow. A jig says 13  I get down there, s√®e about 20 turtles sunning on the mud bank, quickly scurry into the water on my arrival.  I set up and fish are jumping everywhere!  Now im excited!  Beautiful weather, virgin river, fish jumping and nature. It doesnt get any better then this...  Until...  I start casting. Follow ups on almost every cast. Mainly small pike, and a few bass.  I wash top waters, spinner baits, some crawfish, and some twitch baits.  All get follows  Not ONE single hookup!  In two hours i probably seen 30 fish, and couldnt catch one!!!!  All i could do was laugh and enjoy the scenery  I will post a few pics but photobucket is being a pain in the..."
913335,SirCranksalot,2015-05-02 01:45:00,3291,"Sounds like fun just the same!! When folks say ""any luck'? I say ""Yes, I'm lucky to be able to fishing today""."
913337,manitoubass2,2015-05-02 01:52:00,11391,Oh it was a blast?  Ill be right back down there tommorrow
913338,manitoubass2,2015-05-02 01:58:00,11391,     Fell off the bank and landon on a rock Good pain lol

913345,Grimace,2015-05-02 02:34:00,2020,"1 vote for the best fishing necklace ever.  Cheers, looks like a great spot."
913346,Grimace,2015-05-02 02:36:00,2020,Perch coloured necklace.  Solid.
913348,manitoubass2,2015-05-02 02:50:00,11391,My daughter makes them. They are awesome!  All tackle
913350,Joey,2015-05-02 03:04:00,9122,Cool looking river.  Would love to have that in my backyard.   You'll figure the fish out in there the longer you fish it.  Nice owwie on the arm.   Looks like something I'd do
913365,Rizzo,2015-05-02 12:37:00,4754,"right on! Who cares you caught none, you know they are there, gotta eat sometime!"
913367,davey buoy,2015-05-02 12:45:00,5505,"Nice find Rick,lots of fun times ahead I would think!!"
913369,lew,2015-05-02 12:53:00,12766,You got yourself a pretty nice neighborhood up there Rick !!
913371,Steelheadphycho,2015-05-02 14:03:00,470,"That's a nice stretch of water!  You'll get it figured out. One thing is for sure, the fish are curious.  You lucky you......"
913374,manjo39,2015-05-02 14:28:00,354,Nice backyard! After a follow I would try a follow up plastic bait slowly jigging it back.
913384,manitoubass2,2015-05-02 16:35:00,11391,"Yeah I didnt bring any grubs or other plastic just crawfish.  Im gonna go try again today, since its +26 ill probably stay longer.  The water is very muddy at least right now. Its like 3"" visibility lol.  I might walk further too and look for some structure  Seen alot of baitfish getting chased too. I wonder what they are? Maybe just sucker fry???  Looks like good sucker spawning enviroment but I have zero clue what else is in there  Ill sure have fun finding out though?"
913386,manitoubass2,2015-05-02 17:01:00,11391,
913387,Joey,2015-05-02 17:28:00,9122,That'll buff right out
913388,manitoubass2,2015-05-02 17:43:00,11391,Hahahah  Doesnt even hurt. And im not one to bruise easily.  I musta smacked her purdy good
913399,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-02 20:32:00,956,You got a gold mine dude.  Maybe there's a twenty pound pike living there so you can fight him everyday lol.
913406,SirCranksalot,2015-05-02 22:25:00,3291,You got a gold mine dude.  Maybe. But he probably could have gotten a nice new house right next to the 400 coming out of TO for the same price!
913411,manitoubass2,2015-05-02 23:35:00,11391,Wooohoooo found some pike today!!!
913415,chris.brock,2015-05-03 00:13:00,4053,Pretty sweet backyard. It definitely has it's perks living up there.  What did you get today?
913417,Terry,2015-05-03 00:22:00,14456,"nice spot and your arm, that's just a natures tattoo  a little sweet grass and peyote and it will be good as new  lol"
913418,manitoubass2,2015-05-03 00:28:00,11391,"Im not sure how many chris but id guess about 15 pike, also caught one OOS bass and a few suckers.  Most pike were guestimate 20"" but i did catch one good one around 30"" before a storm rolled in  Man the wind was up and that lil river is soooo dirty. I hope it clears up abit"
913419,manitoubass2,2015-05-03 00:29:00,11391,Peyote??? You have a source? Inbox me  Lol
