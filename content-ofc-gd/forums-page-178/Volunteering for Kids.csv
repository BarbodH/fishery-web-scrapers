913582,Spiel,2015-05-04 17:04:00,9065,Well the warm weather fishing season is now under way and local kids fishing events are on the agenda for myself and fellow Stelco Fishing Club members. We had the first volunteer day this past Saturday at an event organized by the Optimist Club of Strabane.     ( https://www.facebook.com/KidsCopsCanadianTire )   Members of our club committee volunteer time and a truck load of equipment and bait to get the kids out fishing at a handful of local events. Always good to see the kids connecting with the outdoors. Our time is spent assisting the young'ns and untangling a steady barrage of tangled lines.  Her's a few pictures I grabbed of the day.      ^ Our own OFC member Fish Farmer.           Photo bombed by Brook (my dog) .... LOL

913598,Rich Clemens,2015-05-04 18:51:00,3131,That's the kind of stuff where you get much more out of it than the kids do. you may never know the true impact you had for just that short amount of time.  Kuddos Chris.
