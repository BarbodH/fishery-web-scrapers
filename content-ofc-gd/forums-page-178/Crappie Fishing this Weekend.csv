Anyone have any luck so far yet for crappie in these spots? I know that there will be tons of people this Saturday since it will be 20 degrees.  I'm strictly a shore fisherman only and I've been scouting different places around the GTA. I do not share honey holes, just public places that's accessible to anyone.  Anyways, I will be posting my video report on my youtube channel and adding the full report to my website.  For my youtube channel What the hell? Where to fish? -> Here For my website (under construction until June 2015) -> www.wheretofish.ca  Good luck to y'all! Let's hope we catch some huge slabs this spring!"

913396,misfish,2015-05-02 19:40:00,29133,"You might want to add that not all areas you show allow fishing.  Example.  Barrie  No fishing allowed on the marina side of the first break wall. Also no fishing allowed off the cement dock at Heritage park. It is well posted. Showing this would help those that think they can.  FYI  is all Im saying.  Heart lake sure has changed from when I remember it 35 years ago. Cat fish and stocked trout and the odd bass. It was my home lake as a young teen.  I see where you want to help others to get out fishing, but IMO, let anglers find spots them self. The WWW has done enough damage already. IMO"

Not to mention this year was no where near the numbers there used to be. Probably just a natural cycle but me thinks a couple internet postings can go a long ways to the destruction of such a tiny spot."
913440,Gallie,2015-05-03 03:29:00,1215,For the record im talking 20 boats in an area maybe 300 feet long by 60 feet wide. You do the math on that.
913491,Sinker,2015-05-03 20:27:00,8692,I have some great crappie spots ii wont even go to annymore because of the crowds. Ignorant people too. Nothing worse.  S.
