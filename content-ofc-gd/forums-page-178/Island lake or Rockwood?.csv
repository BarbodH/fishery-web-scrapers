913125,netminder,2015-04-30 19:36:00,514,I'm taking my young cousin fishing this Sunday and was trying to decide where to go. Looking for a fun and easy place to get to and have narrowed it down to island lake in Orangeville or Rockwood park. I'll be bringing a canoe. Any suggestions or tips on which spot is better this time of year? I know Rockwood stocks trout and island lake should be good for crappie and perch.  Which would you choose?  Thanks

Throw the odd dink pike in and youve got a kid entertained all day. There is even the odd largie and crappie but dont go out expecting to fill the boat with them.  You cant beat the accessibility of island lake either, with plenty of options for a a nice snack lunch/dinner with the kid right next door. its even within eyesight of a canadian tire in case you forget anything."
