913231,cuzza,2015-05-01 12:01:00,467,"Great vid!  New Zealand is just below Alaska on ""the list"" for me - I have some friends down there too"
913232,ken wasik,2015-05-01 12:15:00,9,   That was great.
913237,Ven-Pisc-ator,2015-05-01 12:40:00,39,"That was cool. With all the dragon flies being taken, I thought it was an a dead dragon fly being taken until the line went tight.  Ven"
913239,ken wasik,2015-05-01 12:43:00,9,"I actually have a couple dragon fly lures, they are great. Made by river2sea."
913244,dave524,2015-05-01 12:48:00,4508,"In situations like that I always struck too soon, at the bulge, and pulled it away before the fish had it. Watching the leader line junction really helps. Great video"
913249,cuzza,2015-05-01 13:28:00,467,"I try to see the take, say the word ""trout"" and then strike, easier said than done sometimes though"
913256,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-01 15:03:00,10439,Actually they are not dragon flies though in the same family. They are damsel flies.

913283,cuzza,2015-05-01 17:48:00,467,Actually they are not dragon flies though in the same family. They are damsel flies.  There's a fine line between a damsel and a dragon
913339,FloatnFly,2015-05-02 02:01:00,1640,"This a great video any fisherman would appreciate,  i saw this video a while ago, its called damsels in distress"
913390,esoxansteel,2015-05-02 18:28:00,1307,Just watched it  OK Time to go fishin now
913394,misfish,2015-05-02 18:55:00,29133,"Seen no Damsels today, and I was getting stressed.LOL  There was a bug hatch going on. Maybe baby black flies."
