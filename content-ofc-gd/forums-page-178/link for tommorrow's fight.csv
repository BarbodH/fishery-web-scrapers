913441,Smokercrafty,2015-05-03 03:30:00,227,"Haven't been able to get AAA working anymore, it was awesome at one point though......  Running Helix...."
913449,lookinforwalleye,2015-05-03 13:18:00,4399,There were some issue a little while ago perhaps a fresh download...
913459,manitoubass2,2015-05-03 14:47:00,11391,So how was the fight of the century???  ????
913481,Beavertail,2015-05-03 18:36:00,331,"I didn't watch but I heard the purse was estimated at $300 million, and Mayweather was guaranteed 60% win or lose....I can't even wrap my head around those numbers, crazy. Highest paid athlete in the world."
913486,Smokercrafty,2015-05-03 19:52:00,227,"Yea, I found a way to download it. Was kinda late, caught the last round, which looked brutal. I woulda hung myself if I paid the dollars to go see it live."
913493,BillM,2015-05-03 21:16:00,17367,Undercards were so much better then the main event.
913494,woodenboater,2015-05-03 21:35:00,2277,couldn't pay me to watch his fights. and how about Bones ? guy is spiralling out of control
913495,Toronto_Angler,2015-05-03 21:36:00,698,Not sure why ppl bought the media hype. May weather is a great fighter but is boring as anything. Always has and always wil be its his style
913576,AKRISONER,2015-05-04 16:06:00,5558,Everyone got reminded why no one watches boxing lol
913609,davey buoy,2015-05-04 19:57:00,5505,"Everyone got reminded why no one watches boxing lol Thinking and heard that somewhat. Looks like the last big boxing match for some time. Great marketing by UFC !!!,we now have something more to compare it to,and I after seeing parts of this ,UFC can only get better IMO.$100 plus million,win or lose ,Mayweather.That won't happen again,at least for a long time .The amount of money to each fighter is ridiculous."
