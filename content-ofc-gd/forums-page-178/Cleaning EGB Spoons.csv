Want to get them tuned up nice for my lake trout trip a week from now ."

913748,Sinker,2015-05-05 15:51:00,8692,Ive also had good luck on tarnished spoons. Ive had days where a tarnished spoon is the only one they will bite. Ive even taken a lighter to spoons to give them a tarnished look with success.  S.

913770,solopaddler,2015-05-05 18:27:00,8605,Love EGB's but they tarnish like crazy! And no they don't work as well either. I've cleaned many an EGB with silver polish successfully - the stuff you use for silverware. Careful if it's a copper EGB (my favorite). You can rub the copper finish right off.

913935,4x4bassin,2015-05-06 02:58:00,1025,"Thanks for the replies everyone , they are really not that bad so I think I might just leave them as they are and hope for the best . They are mostly copper/gold with paint so I don't want to ruin them with a cleaner ."
913937,adempsey,2015-05-06 03:31:00,1498,"For the copper spoons you could try soaking them in a mild acid, like lemon juice or vinegar/ketchup.   Ever drop a penny in some cola?  That always cleaned them up!  If the others are silver (not sure if EGB's use real silver plate or not?), but good old baking soda with a piece of aluminum foil and hot water works great."
