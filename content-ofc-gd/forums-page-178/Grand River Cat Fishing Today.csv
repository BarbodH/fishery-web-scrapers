913400,Bill Shearer,2015-05-02 20:35:00,456,"My buddy and I had the pleasure of fishing for Cats today with Fisherpete. For those that don't know or have never met him, he is very personable, and knowledgable about the quarry, and the catching! For some reason known only to the cats, they were not anxious to get caught today. But catch them we did! Pete said we had to cast to the other side of the river, in order to interest the fish. Believe me he almost did! We caught a variety of sizes, but the biggest was around 15lbs!, the smallest would have been around 3 lbs. All were caught on Petes specially prepared, and carefully stored premium special.* I'm not shy, just careful of the sun. I hate sunblock stuff!   Here are a few photos.       *see Pete for recipe"
913404,c10,2015-05-02 21:37:00,131,"Awesome! Nice fish, thanks for sharing!"
913405,grizzlybri,2015-05-02 21:49:00,565,"great report, all of the recent reports from the cat fish trips makes me excited for mine tomorrow"
913408,Ralph Field,2015-05-02 22:38:00,1018,Looks like a fun day !
913412,landry,2015-05-02 23:41:00,1005,I was there with 3 kids. It was the first time I have ever been skunked there. Fishing was tough. Well done.
913421,Bondar,2015-05-03 00:41:00,817,"We had a tough morning, but managed to salvage the afternoon with 6 quick fish, biggest was 17 then 14 all the way down to about 2 lbs. Ended with 8 I believe. Thanks Pete for meeting me on the river to complete a classified transaction lol nice hand off floatman"
913424,Acountdeleted,2015-05-03 01:12:00,2562,Some great cats there. Nice report.
913428,sleepjigging,2015-05-03 01:30:00,207,"Good stuff.  80% of fishermen know about them Channel Cats 20% can catch them Only the select few, like Pete, can do it right NOW.  I am still waiting to catch a big kitty."
913429,Fisherpete,2015-05-03 01:30:00,1814,"Great fishing with you and Frank today! It was indeed a tough bite today, catch a few fish then had to move to another spot. You and Frank landed 11, and I managed another 9 after you left for a total of 20. Six of my nine came in a twenty minute flurry just before dark.  Nice meeting you as well Jeff - that mid-river handoff was a wee bit sketchy lol!!! Oh well, nobody and no gear ended up swimming - all is well. See ya out there in the morning.  Back at it tomorrow - doing a multi-species day with Brian and guest Mike (cats and carp). Gonna be fun!!!  Pete"
913448,akaShag,2015-05-03 13:00:00,2073,"I guess it will be up to Andy to receive Pete's tutelage this year.  I did win the ""Fishing for Tyler"" auction that Pete donated, but things got a wee bit too busy here and I also did a hand-off, but not over water...........  I hope the cats cooperate when Andy makes the trek down there!  Doug"
913571,AKRISONER,2015-05-04 15:32:00,5558,"glad to see you guys caught a few!, some day I am going to have to save up some pennies and get Pete to take me out for some musky.  The part about Pete being personable is dead on, hes the kinda guy you want to be fishing with for sure. One of the nicest guys on the boards for sure."
913583,landry,2015-05-04 17:06:00,1005,Are. You guiding now Pete????

913621,Fisherpete,2015-05-04 20:35:00,1814,"Are. You guiding now Pete????  Yes I am Landry - the Fishing for Tyler charity trips I offered up have led to some others... and I have to say it's been an absolute blast helping people catch these fat cats! I'm just doing it on a part time basis on the weekends. I'll post a full report of all my trips later this week, last Saturday with another board member and his buddy was one for the record books... stay tuned! (Hint : 10? 20? 30? 40????)  Pete"
913632,landry,2015-05-04 21:42:00,1005,Well good luck with that - it will help pay for more fishing necessities:)
913633,grizzlybri,2015-05-04 21:45:00,565,I'll be posting a report on the day I had yesterday
913728,AKRISONER,2015-05-05 13:45:00,5558,cant wait to see some more reports from Pete's trips. It makes it more interesting knowing the guide in person!
