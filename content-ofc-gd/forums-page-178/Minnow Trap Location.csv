I have a metal minnow trap, but have never had luck catching them.  All the info I read says put the trap in feeder creeks...but there arent any.  Tips appreciated.  Thanks."
913635,Gallie,2015-05-04 21:50:00,1215,Best i can tell you would be to find a spot in the shallows and weeds where you can see baitfish and set your trap there. Make sure it is labeled.
913636,cheaptackle,2015-05-04 22:00:00,849,A slice of sourdough bread in the trap as bait.  Under the dock overnight.  Worked well for me!  Michael

913663,Sinker,2015-05-05 00:52:00,8692,"Yes, leave it overnight for sure."

There's lots of creeks that may look fishy but in actuality, they could be void of cyprinids..  X2 on what Gallie mentioned.  Your best bet is to find a shallow bay with some weed growth (the temperature may suit minnows better at this time of year), locate the bait and set up there.  Good luck on the French!"
