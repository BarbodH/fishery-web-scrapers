They're asking people to guess when a lure they have lying on the ice completely falls through. Very few people have entered and it won't be long before the ice goes, so pretty decent odds.  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Brace-Lake-Outfitters/147981611920988?fref=nf&pnref=story  "
912998,chris.brock,2015-04-30 00:26:00,4053,Pretty cool idea.  I'm going to check the sat images and give it a shot.
913028,tb4me,2015-04-30 04:29:00,3295,I took may 12 at 3pm..we shall see!
913032,FloatnFly,2015-04-30 10:30:00,1640,"Pretty cool idea.  I'm going to check the sat images and give it a shot.   they do daily ice updates on their FB page, still about 18"" left"
913034,solopaddler,2015-04-30 10:40:00,8605,"  they do daily ice updates on their FB page, still about 18"" left  Yes, but many lakes west and north of Nakina are already ice free. There's still lots of ice but it's in very bad shape.  Some info for you guys. Remember last springs historically late ice out? Brace Lake was the ONLY outfitter who still flew in on the opener. They had to fly the plane in from Geraldton because Cordingly Lake in Nakina was still frozen. Why? Because Brace Lake warms up faster than any other lake in the region. It's always the first lake to be ice free.  I'm pretty sure it's going to go way before May 12, fwiw  ."
