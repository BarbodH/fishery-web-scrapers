913328,tb4me,2015-05-02 00:43:00,3295,So why are they all burnt? Do they just burn them when they cant get them off the ice in time? If that crap keeps up they wont allow huts out on the ice much longer..

913353,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-02 03:45:00,8243,Absolutely disgusting as well as extremely dangerous to boaters. One would have to be nuts to boat in that water after ice out.

913447,akaShag,2015-05-03 12:55:00,2073,"Same thing happened to me on Simcoe about 1987 or so.  I had a large ice shack off Big Bay Point and we got a thaw the second week or so of January.  Ice travel was impossible by any means except maybe hovercraft and helicopter.  The ice did not firm back up until weeks later, and when I could get back out to my shack, the TOP of the floor was more than a foot under the ice surface.  It took two of us the better part of a day to wreck the shack and cut it out of the ice with a chain saw and pry bars/etc.  We loaded the debris into a trailer and took it to a landfill site where I paid more good money to dump it.  I never owned another permanent shack...............   "
913544,myot,2015-05-04 11:44:00,131,This is why in the future you'll see a no permanent huts allowed and I'm sure Clam corp and Fraible are licking their lips at that  Dan
