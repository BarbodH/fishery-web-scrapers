913138,Gallie,2015-04-30 21:58:00,1215,Is there any way to vote without having facebook?
913142,Terry,2015-04-30 22:24:00,14456,I did the first day and now just got 3 family members to like
913143,Acountdeleted,2015-04-30 22:31:00,2562,Looks like she's in the lead by quite a bit. Keep my fingers crossed for the win.

913152,Fisherpete,2015-04-30 23:14:00,1814,Done!
913153,Handlebarz,2015-04-30 23:16:00,3790,Thank you all so much it's been a neck to neck race every time one goes ahead the other pulls out big numbers to take back the lead. Keep spreading the word
913155,Gallie,2015-04-30 23:29:00,1215,"I used my wifes account to vote, she was ahead by 25. Good luck"
913322,Handlebarz,2015-05-01 23:47:00,3790,Thanks for all the help everyone Danna was kicked out of the contest because I tagged people in my comments. The rules stated no tagging the photo but had nothing about making comments so I kinda screwed her over and the other girl complained.  Again thank you all for supporting her.
913324,Acountdeleted,2015-05-02 00:07:00,2562,Awww geez. What nonsense. They should have been more specific on the rules.
913342,Joey,2015-05-02 02:16:00,9122,"That sucks Mike, the rules seem pretty silly to me.   You've won on OFC anyhow Danna"
