913083,KraTToR,2015-04-30 15:29:00,506,"I'm looking for a kick-a$$ gas pressure washer. Something that delivery pressure north of 3000 psi and is easy to find parts for.  I currently have a Grizzly (bought it at Rona) with a Honda engine but even the ""O"" rings for the wand are not standard size.  Pretty frustrating and I contacted the manufacturer and he pointed me to a service centre in my area.  The service centre informed me that they didn't have the O rings and i'd have to order a new wand and hose...  Bull!  Thanks in advance!  Patrick."
913123,captpierre,2015-04-30 19:32:00,2521,Looking for one too Costco has one that usually goes on sale for $400. Honda engine and Karcher pressure system. The hose is rather thin and plastic. Lowes have heavier duty Dewalt units but $800+. Just want it for around the house and cottage What to get?
913124,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-30 19:33:00,8243,"Unfortunately that has been my experience as well on most everything these days. They don't want us to repair much of anything. My remote foot pedal for my Motor Guide needed to be replaced, nope I needed to buy a complete unit, the remote control foot pedals are no longer available. I can't remember which brand it was but a pal had the same exact experience as you, he needed a part for his expensive power washer wand and had to buy the complete wand. Sorry I can't help."
913127,DanD,2015-04-30 19:58:00,2223,"Have you tried going to an automotive supplier; places like NAPA and Carquest, usually carry a large assortment of O rings. Or a hydraulics rebuilder, they may have these odd ball seals, you may not find the seal by application; but by comparison and measurements?  Dan."
913131,davey buoy,2015-04-30 20:47:00,5505,"Try Able O rings if you ever get to Toronto,On Steeles,south side just east of Pine Valley.They have any o-ring or seal.That's what they do.Bring a sample if possible."
913136,F7Firecat,2015-04-30 21:41:00,347,A Honda motor with a comet pump and you will never have problems finding parts.
913144,NANUK,2015-04-30 22:35:00,797,"Sounds like you need an industrial grade gas power washer, You won't find anything like that at a big box store, We have a Goodway pressure washer at work, very reliable and robust pump ( hot water rated ) with a Honda engine, parts are available here in Scarborough. http://www.goodway.com/products/pressure-washers"
913148,ecmilley,2015-04-30 22:49:00,2163,Yamaha 3600  psi gas washer is 849 and kicks ass
913162,ketchenany,2015-05-01 00:00:00,3229,THANKS  I drive by there every day and never noticed them! I'm been having lots of problems with and electric Simonize (sp) crap and they say wand can't be fixed (leaks) only used a few times  I'll check them out.
913191,Basskicker,2015-05-01 02:11:00,421,"I just bought a Diamond 2600PSI with Honda engine on sale today for 399.00 at canadian tire. The reviews were good and it only took 15 minutes to put together, fill with oil and gas and it fired up on the 1st pull.  It's in this weeks flyer."
913192,Freshtrax,2015-05-01 02:14:00,2215,Any bearing shop will have the oring.  Heck they have oil seals for old motors long discontinued.   You will need dimensions or the old one.
913200,OhioFisherman,2015-05-01 02:57:00,6623,"I have no idea if you have Harbor Freight Tool stores up there, if you get stateside they might be worth a visit?  http://www.harborfreight.com/catalogsearch/result?q=o+rings"
913219,DanD,2015-05-01 09:44:00,2223,"No Harbor Freight North of the boarder but we have Princess Auto and I never thought of them until you posted.  http://www.princessauto.com/en/search?Dy=1&Nty=1&Ntt=o+ring  I always stop in at HF when we go over to Port Huron; a man's Avon store full of inexpensive stuff, that we don't always need; but have too have. LOL  Dan."
913326,ketchenany,2015-05-02 00:21:00,3229,"I bought the Pricess Auto O ring box but none did the trick! Now I have lots of  O rings. The manufactures make them so you can't fix them as told by Simonize, buy a new wand and hose, cost of a new unit. They sell a crap product that only works for a few times. I will get even soon, I will find a way of stopping the leaking problem they say can't be fixed."
913327,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-02 00:43:00,10439,You could pick up a wand @ Princess Auto too. Maybe one with replaceable O-rings.
913354,Freshtrax,2015-05-02 03:53:00,2215, Like I said earlier any bearing / industrial supply shop will have the seal your  your looking for.
913701,Mister G,2015-05-05 11:06:00,1429,The Best Power Washer is the one you borrow from your neighbor. Just make sure he tops off the tanks with expensive gasoline and soap. And it's always best to use his water too.
