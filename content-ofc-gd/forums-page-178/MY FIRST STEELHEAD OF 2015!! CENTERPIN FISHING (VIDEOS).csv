910427,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-16 11:40:00,937,"I fished a new trib and from the looks of it every popular hole was packed with people.  So I had to find a little stretch of my own to fish.  This spot I choose had lots of snags but had potential to have fish in it.  After getting snagged and retying numerous times, I finally catch my first steelhead of the year  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBiRRyC6crU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yxlCcy6Qc"
910431,BillM,2015-04-16 12:05:00,17367,Nice fish!  Good job at handling it as well.
910432,Steelheadphycho,2015-04-16 12:08:00,470,That's what it's all about!  Nice fish!
910433,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-16 12:10:00,937,^^^ Thanks  Nice fish!  Good job at handling it as well.  These don't have sharp teeth

910618,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-17 12:05:00,937,Thanks guys!
910955,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-19 12:52:00,937,I can't wait for opener  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yxlCcy6Qc
911637,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-22 14:25:00,937,My first steelhead caught with a hardbait.  We kept this one because the treble pierced its eye.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-LAtCh5BaQ
911684,Salmonidstalker,2015-04-22 17:35:00,265,At least now you know to switch those trebles to a single siwash.  Less lost lures and safe release on future fish.
911805,Freshtrax,2015-04-23 01:19:00,2215,I've killed way more rainbows with siwash hooks over trebles.  Rainbows always seem to take em in the brain.
911861,BillM,2015-04-23 12:39:00,17367,"If you're that worried about hooks, pinch the barbs... treble or siwash it doesn't matter.  I find siwash hooks do way more damage (especially out in the lake)..  Ends up making giant holes in their faces."
912945,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-29 15:47:00,937,"I'll be pinching 2 of the 3 barbs .  As for opener, I found it to be less fish then last year...I see lots of them spawning but I don't target those  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1U4nW36HiY"
912949,Ven-Pisc-ator,2015-04-29 16:00:00,39,"Nice, I love the way the reel sounds when the fish is on a run.  It looks like the duck landing on the water triggered the one fish.   Ven"
