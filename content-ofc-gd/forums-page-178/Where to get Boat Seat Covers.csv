913605,jimmer,2015-05-04 19:30:00,2730,"I had bought a boat seat cover to go over a fold down seat a few years back. The cover eventually rotted due to weather. It was purchased at Canadian Tire. They no longer sell them and I can't seem to find anyone local that carries boat seat covers. Anyone know where I can find them? It was waterproof with an elastic around the base. The cover just slipped over the seat for storage purposes, it was removed when the seat was in use. Any ideas? Thanks, jimmer"
913613,Fisherman,2015-05-04 20:06:00,7201,"Well how about this, I use the large outboard motor covers from P/A for both my BBQ's and outdoor chairs.  They have drawstraps and buckles, 3 years so far and still in good condition.  They go for about $16 maybe less on sale.  Don't hog mine http://www.princessauto.com/en/detail/70-to-150-hp-outboard-motor-cover/A-p8196941e"

LOL  http://www.etrailer.com/Covers/Classic%20Accessories/052963854633.html  Dan  Sorry forgot to add; I've ordered stuff from E Trailer in the past. They're fast and I think they use USPS, so the brokerage fee won't give you a heart attach when your purchase arrives."

913736,jimmer,2015-05-05 14:27:00,2730,Thanks for the great suggestions. One of these should work and the garbage bag is the fall back that I have been thinking about. My wife didn't like the garbage bag idea. LOL
