Anything you want to share is welcome  So far, I have figure out the VISPAS link and the fishing allowed map App. Zander=walleye. They have pike, perch. Pickperch=pickerel. Bicycle rentals 5Eu/day so I can get to some spots."
912688,irishfield,2015-04-28 02:41:00,26272,You'll be so busy window shopping that you'll never make it to the fishing !
912692,BillM,2015-04-28 02:54:00,17367,Hire a guide.
912693,Acountdeleted,2015-04-28 02:55:00,2562,I'd be too busy 'counting red lights' to go fishing if I were there.
912700,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-28 04:37:00,8243,"The only thing I can suggest is to stay at the Hotel Krasnipolski in Amsterdam. Also wear a Canadian flag pin. The Dutch love Canucks, it was overwhelming to me. The last thing I would be doing in The Netherlands is waste time fishing unless you are there for weeks. I know I just said fishing was a waste of time but it sounds worse than it is meant to be. You are in Holland man, see the country it is gorgeous this time of year. If you insist hire a guide like Bill suggests."
912771,esoxansteel,2015-04-28 18:00:00,1307,"Red lights and Hash Bars, if your going there to fish you out of your mind"
912779,fishingwithbob,2015-04-28 18:52:00,123,"Not sure Iâ€™d be fishing over there, but others seemed to like to drop a line in the canals while I was there.  Too much other stuff to do.        "
912818,HTHM,2015-04-28 21:49:00,4082,"With the amount of culture that is literally at your fingertips, buy a train pass and follow its' headlights getting off at random stops. Holland is a very safe country, just like Canada. Equal amount of dickheads. Best defensive phrase: Rout op. (Get lost)"
912847,Gerritt,2015-04-29 00:11:00,6129,Might help to learn Turkish too
912856,sleepjigging,2015-04-29 01:06:00,207,"You guys are being shy. Besides red lights and hash bars, you are keeping very quiet about your adventures over there.  Just saying:)"
912880,HTHM,2015-04-29 02:33:00,4082,Might help to learn Turkish too And farsi... Vervelete buiterlanders.
912889,Lunkerhunter,2015-04-29 04:03:00,455,"Been many times. Love it over there  Enjoy the ""coffeeshops"" , museums, amazing restaurants and culture.  I would probably agree fishing will not make it on my list things to do the next time I go either  If you are looking for a good restaurant in Amsterdam check out casa di David. It's in the Jordaan district. Reservations pretty much required.  Another good one is a small place but amazing Indian food. It's called balraj and its on haarlemerstaaat. On the way to the restaurant pop into one of the many coffeeshops to help build your appetite. Haha  If your looking for something outdoors to do go walk through many of the beautiful parks all over the city. The popular one is vondelpark but many others.  The redlight district is fun for a night of bar hopping and taking in the scenery. Lmao  Enjoy your trip. If you know what area of the city you are staying I can help more."
912893,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-29 04:20:00,8243,"I'm not shy. We were  toured around the city by a few youngsters that insisted they let them show us their hospitality. They had a brand new 500 series Benz and a cooler full of beer in it. I've been around and was suspicious that we were about to get scammed which the seedier side of any international city has. One of our stops was a gorgeous 500 year old mansion with a bar/club that doubled as a brothel.  $100.00 USD cover charge which was no big deal. That $100.00 including any top shelf libation they had, no Louis XIII but Courvoisier and Armagnac they did have, now with us that is a deal and a half. This is how it works, if a young lady sat with you for an hour and you bought her drinks during that time she would escort you to her room for a half hour. Of course she was drinking Dom at $500.00 a bottle which was in reality ginger ale, but they charged you for the Champagne. As well she or he, whatever was your preference as I saw a few rich ladies in the joint, could prove she was born a she with a piece of paper.  Now that has to prove she is a she, hell she had a piece of paper to prove it. I kept my 500 bucks and something else in my Levi's.  It works that way in most international cities around the world. The hospitable drivers get a cut from the establishment for bringing you there. No pressure to buy in that club in Amsterdam, none whatsoever. Some places like in Rome play the heavy hand with civilians. They were very polite at this place and we sat there chatting for a few hours. When we left the young guys in the Mercedes drove us back to our hotel and bought a round of Heinekens and Vodka shots. You can't go to Amsterdam and not visit a brothel, a classy one only."
