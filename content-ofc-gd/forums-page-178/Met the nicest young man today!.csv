I was also impressed that his mom came for the drive with him, turns out she grew up in Lindsay, not many parents today take the time to see what their kids are up to but she did!  Looking forward to seeing more of both of them!"
913482,Spiel,2015-05-03 19:05:00,9065,I've had the pleasure of spending time with him on a few occasions now Cliff. A finer and more talented young man you'd be hard pressed to find in today's world..
