371628,frozen-fire,2009-08-11 15:30:00,542,"My first real outing after the trip to Scugog where I got the muskie Decided to try Rice for the first time this year. I had no idea there was a tournament going on, so I figured it wouldn't be such a good day. Despite seeing lots of tournament anglers and many other fishing boats out there, we did okay! Lots of smaller fish, nothing to brag about        At least they kept us occupied.  Fish were caught jigging visible weedlines. I was going for walleye but came up empty handed. spinnerbaits didn't produce, topwater in the evening by the pads and scum didn't produce.  Here are some pics of the earlier ones we got that day. Most of the fish were clones. Seemed to be exactly the same size... born the same year I guess. We stopped taking pics cause it seemed like we were catching the same fish over and over again haha.      "
371632,evster,2009-08-11 15:42:00,367,Sweet fish!  Looks like a fun day.
371634,Dusky,2009-08-11 15:49:00,310,Nice going!
371637,TC1OZ,2009-08-11 15:54:00,987,"Nice fish man!  I'm jealous of your fishing abilities, canoe, boat, and girlfriend! hahahaha!"
371638,Radnine,2009-08-11 15:55:00,1538,Nice job! And having a girlfriend that will fish with you will make things a lot easier in the future. Thanks for the report. Jim
371639,frozen-fire,2009-08-11 15:58:00,542,I love it when she joins me out on the water! Her passion is pike and crappie fishing though...not a big fan of bass haha.
371648,Leecher,2009-08-11 16:11:00,7832,Beauty report and pics frozen-fire Some nice looking bassin you guys got into!!! Good job and thanks for sharing Leechman
371659,jediangler,2009-08-11 16:36:00,1923,"Nice bass frozen-fire. I'm with your girlfriend on the bass fishing, more of a fan of pike and crappie. Musky is still #1 with me though. Congrats on getting a musky on Scugog. I must have been at the cottage when you caught it and missed the report. Looks like you had very calm conditions for Rice."
371673,frozen-fire,2009-08-11 16:58:00,542,"Very calm in the morning, but the winds picked up later on towards the evening...to the point where I put my pfd back on!"
371752,rbaquial,2009-08-11 22:00:00,968,Nice catch!  Looks like you guys were just rotating the boat around... and re-taking the picture of the same fish!!  hahaha JK

373770,REQ,2009-08-18 14:49:00,2,"Nice pics!  Which part of Rice Lake?  Did you a rent a boat?  Any suggestions would help, I'm planning to head up to Rice Lake for some bass!"
373783,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-18 15:58:00,3761,"Good to see nice healthy fish coming out of there! I'll have to make my way out to Rice one day.  Thanks for the report, MTBF"
373840,hockeyplayerz_14,2009-08-18 18:49:00,160,Nice fish rice lake is really good for big largemouth.
373960,JohnF,2009-08-19 00:51:00,3494,"Jeez! All you young guys are killin' me here. Nobody told us back in the antediluvian days that pretty girls fished.  Who knew? If only I'da had a hint I'd never have given up fishing way back then.  Not that giving it up helped me get pretty girls anyway. Even the sports cars and the long neck 5 string (yeah, yeah, yeah, there was a very brief time when guys with banjoes were considered cool) didn't do it. Girls didn't seem to appreciate my better-than-average abilities with a 4 speed shifter either. I'm slowly coming to the realization that mebbe, just mebbe, I was kinda ugly or something. My ego is still slightly bruised after all these years.  Man. If only I hadn't quit fishing for so long. I think I got you young pups figgered out though. You really don't care about the fish. You just do it fer the wimmen.  Smart.  JF"
