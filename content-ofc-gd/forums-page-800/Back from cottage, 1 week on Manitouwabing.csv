373007,Cudz,2009-08-16 02:23:00,2652,"Just got back from a cottage on beautiful Lake Manitouwabing near Parry Sound.  I stayed at a small resort on one of the many bays.  Such a nice lake.  Didn't matter how hard the wind blows you can always find calm water (unlike Simcoe).  Anyway, I have 3 small children so we did a bunch of panfish fishing and we caught a bunch but I don't fish as I am too busy taking off fish and putting on worms.  Between eating and taking kids for tube rides, I managed to get out fishing 5 times by myself for 2-3 hours at a time. It took me a day to figre out what would work and where the fish were.  I am not much of a walleye guy so I didn't even try for them.  I don't really target pike either (got a few by accident), but I do like the bass.  Overall it was a very good week and once I figured out the bass I managed to get about a dozen per outing.  Unfortunately I forgot my net at home and it cost me on 3 occasions.  I lost a 4+ pound largie at the boat while trying to lip it, another decent largemouth at the boat and another huge smallie.  doh!  My boat isn't exactly fishing friendly but hey, beggers can't be choosers.  enjoy  Here is the cottage  Setting the boat up  Boat on dock  Little Pike  Another little hammer handle off the dock  Ok now onto the bass First bass was a smallie (how fitting)  Nice clean Largemouth  Even better Largemout 2.6 pounds  This picture is dedicated to Simon (Limeyangler) due to the blurr. haha  Another nice clean smallie  Nice Largemout  Best Largemouth of the trip  Best fish of the trip 21"" smallmouth (note how wet I am trying to lip the fish off my ladder on the back of my boat.

373418,hoops12,2009-08-17 13:44:00,127,How is it fishing out of a Bowrider?  Looking to get a boat/family boat.
373673,msp,2009-08-18 02:20:00,1336,Great report. I always heard great things about that lake. Looks like you got em pretty good. Thanks for the report.
373675,hockeyplayerz_14,2009-08-18 02:25:00,160,VERY nice fish. Good Report!!!!!
373681,Cudz,2009-08-18 02:36:00,2652,It is not ideal but a boat is much better than no boat.  I can't complain at all but would love to have a bow mount electric. It is a bit tough to land fish without a net as it is quite deep.  That will teach me to forget my net at home when i go to a cottage.
