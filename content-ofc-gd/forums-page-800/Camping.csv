I usually go interior camping but this year plans have changed, but'm still looking for a place that has that feel to it.   Thanks for you help"
373462,Fang,2009-08-17 15:31:00,1330,do you have a general area targetted or range of driving time from where your located.  You can not beat Algonquin for the fall. Spectacular and the crowds have diminished a lot.

373582,John Bacon,2009-08-17 22:47:00,3277,Will you have a canoe?  Algonquin park has some paddle to sites that are a comprimise between dive to and interior.  Their are water taxi's on Lake Opeongo that can take you to a site on the lake.  The Cannisbay and Pog lake camp grounds in Algonquin do offer some somewhat secluded sites.

You can fish from shore where it narrows towards the Military side, but nothing beats a canoe.  Best spot to fish is just inside the Military side.  Dont worry the Helicopters if they see you wont do anything.  Too much of a problem for RangeControl to drive then boat just to tell you to stay out.  Trust me."
