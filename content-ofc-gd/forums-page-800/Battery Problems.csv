373244,Hutch,2009-08-16 23:17:00,11,Having trouble with my battery that is used for the engine.  I'm not connecting the wires correctly and it's not recharging itself.  I have two neg and two positive wires.  I don't know how else to explain it but any help would be appreciated.
373262,Fisherman,2009-08-16 23:56:00,7201,"Well, I'm going to take my stab at it, one pair of positive & neg wires to start the motor and the other pair for accessories such as lights, radio, fish finder, etc.  Both the positive wires go to the positive post, the neg's go to the other post. No two ways about it.  If it's not charging, then you may have a blown fuse in the charging circuit or the ""electronics"" that do the charging may be faulty.  What kind of motor, etc, do you have?"
373264,Terry,2009-08-17 00:00:00,14456,yup
373387,Jer,2009-08-17 11:42:00,1426,"If it's not the charging circuit on the motor, could be as simple as the battery is pooched and won't hold a charge."
373397,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-17 12:10:00,1022, What he said.
373401,Garnet,2009-08-17 12:30:00,2056,Fully charge the battery.  Either a load tester or a multi meter. Should be between 12.5 and 13.25 if you have the load tester $39 at princes auto load test the battery if that checks good start engine and check battery should be 14+ if battery still test at same volts your charging system is not working.  Completely clean battery post and every connection and use white die electric grease on every connection.  Garnet
373454,Tybo,2009-08-17 14:59:00,1373,"Why would you use di-electric grease on the contacts. Isn't this stuff made, not to conduct electricity."
373465,Fisherman,2009-08-17 15:57:00,7201,"That sort of goes with the ""high octane"" myth...oh ya, it makes wayyyy more power,  some folks should read what some products actually do and what they shouldn't be used for."
373471,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-17 16:13:00,10439,The Di-Electric grease is not there to help conductivity it it there to help protect the connection from corrosion.
373487,Tybo,2009-08-17 17:00:00,1373,A properly cleaned and tight connection prevents corrosion.
373490,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-17 17:09:00,10439,It would need to be pretty darn tight to let no air in between the post and cable end.
373493,Tybo,2009-08-17 17:19:00,1373,Corrosion is caused by heat. A loose and/or dirty connection will draw more amperage. More amperage means more heat.
