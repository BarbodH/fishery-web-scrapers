373176,Joey,2009-08-16 20:37:00,9122,"It was hot, we fished, we caught fish, the end    Started off with this nice one, what a fight, took me forever to get it in.     Stuff like this was EVERYWHERE.  It was like an obstacle course.    Then the Double Header     That was fun, and a big mess of lines, but we boated them both.  Here are the twins        This was a problem all day long - fleas, yuck.    Cheers,  Joey"

373499,tonyb,2009-08-17 17:25:00,1637,"Very nice!  Lucky Lund strikes again  Double headers are great when you have help, but try that when you're on your own ...not so great hehe  Tony"
373502,blaque,2009-08-17 17:32:00,2419," Boo Hoo Tony, Boo Hoo."
373503,Twocoda,2009-08-17 17:34:00,4130,good shootin guys ...double headers are fun ..triples are kaos...(the spring derby we managed two times to pull off...double headers on one rod...( mainline and cheater ) fun fun fun
373506,Dooops,2009-08-17 17:48:00,9,"Nice, when you say a double header do you mean you have two hooks on your lure and you had a fish on both hooks at the same time?  Also, I am looking at the flea picture and I was curious as to what that is? Is it something that floats on top of the water and accumulates as you reel in?  And now to the comments. Beautiful fish! Those are rainbow trouts right?"
373522,Joey,2009-08-17 19:06:00,9122," Hey Doops, a double header is when two rods get a fish on at the same time.  So, when trolling for Salmon (or any fish) two rods go off and you have a fish on each one and two people are fighting a fish at the same time.  If you are alone, as Tony mentioned, that would be quite hard to do.  The fleas are in the water, I'm not sure at what depth they hang out, but they accumulate on the line and build up and then when you are fighting a fish reeling in they all jam up at the tip of the rod and at times you can't reel in anymore.  And those are salmon.    Thanks for the replies everyone.  Appreciate the nice comments.   Joey"
