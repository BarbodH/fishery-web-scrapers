373500,The Urban Fisherman,2009-08-17 17:28:00,2050,"AWESOME report buddy!  You did your homework, caught some GIANT bass ( the bowfin are really cool to! ) , and my favorite part is the fact that you took your little cousin out and got her into some fish....not to mention the fact that you were able to put your pops onto some good fish also!  I am envious of you brother.  Hard to beat two weeks spent like that!  You're a good big cousin, big brother, a heck of a son, and a future bass  tournament contender!  Thanks a lot for the report.  Cheers, Ryan"
373505,johnnyb,2009-08-17 17:46:00,3413,Wow...you certainly lived up to your name...way to go!    And thanks for taking the time to post it!
373545,Dusky,2009-08-17 20:08:00,310,This is some serious fishing! a good read.
373660,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-18 02:03:00,3761," Thanks for all the reply's everbody, it was a great fulfilling trip!  I just wanted to say thanks to you Ryan for your kind words, now with 4 years of college comes tight budgets but hey all the more time to perfect my skills and get ready for a possible future of small time tournys and fun fishing. I like to think that because of me my brother has started to fish more after i bought him a rod, same deal with my cousin, i got her into fishing and she lives on a lake and never fished before   Anyway, just wanted to say a special thanks to you because well I don't often think of the appreciation that my dad, brother, and friends and family show me when I take them fishing and get them onto fish. This Thursday-Monday I'm going up to a friends cottage up on the Georgian Bay and I have more teaching to do up there lol.  It will be fun and as always expect a report!  Tightlines, MTBF"
373669,msp,2009-08-18 02:15:00,1336,Great job on the largies. They look way heavier than you say. Lets just call the big one a five pounder ! Every good fisherman knows how to exagerate or just plain out lie ! Thumbs up
373678,hockeyplayerz_14,2009-08-18 02:30:00,160,wow some big fish and i liked where you were fishing
373687,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-18 02:55:00,3761," lol, sure bud. I forget to type up the weights correctly but for the record 4.10lbs is the same as 4lbs 10oz...Next time I'll type out the weights better but hey my Rapala Digital don't lie...too bad it would lie 6 oz's or so so that bass would be a 5lb'r   MTBF"
373696,ciceri,2009-08-18 03:36:00,535,"Good report Mike... Good luck up on Georgian Bay, we've finally found the smallies, biggest being just a tad over 5 pounds, a few 4's and 3's, and plenty under that."
372951,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-15 22:39:00,3761,"Hello again everybody, i have not had a chance to read through the reports and threads yet so bare with me. I had a amazing time up in Eastern Ontario(35mins past the Smith Falls Exit on the 401) for these last 2 weeks. I caught/weighed 22 bass over 1.2lbs and pulled in 4 Bowfin and a nice sized pike for the area.After a quick calaulation and look at my organized weight/species/photo # chart i prepared my biggest 5 bass gave me a weight of 17.7lbs...better than last years bag or around 13lbs+ as i remember.So as in the title i got log's of pictures to share with you readers/viewers. We got out new boat fixed up and sea worthty, got a small motor and a battery, paddles, and carrying handles for out Thornes 12ft boat! It was a blast being able to stand up and cast and be safe and confident the boat was not going to throw me out of it. Now let me start with the photos:So, here is a shot of our waterfront ""Village"" where we had our tents and cooking area out behind my grandmas house-My little brother, Doug and I out on the boat for the first time...also a future OFC'r!Doug getting to try out driving-Now keep in mind these photos were shot all within a 2 week time frame so in no particular order here the rest of them come.Solo cruise into bass territory-Decent largieAfter about 5 hit/misses i landed my first bass on a frog...not a giant but a start!And with 1 comes 2!lol, as every report i try to include a animal picture...well here is something I'm sure everybody has seen-First ""big"" bass of the trip, 2.11 this fish was-For all you bowfin lovers out there here are some bowfin I pulled out of this lake during out trip-5.11lbs3.14lbs(Bad photo I know)6.1lb PB BowfinThought I would slide in a photo my my Great Grandmother who had her birthday this trip and turned a astonishing 101 years old Thought I would throw in some Crappie's also before I get to the bass segment-The firstAnd the SecondOn to bass...otherwise known as the best fish of freshwater Took my Dad out fishing and got him use to fishing weeds with my snakeslargie on the snake(as many of the other fish)And another he caught on our outingOk, back to me. Cool shot of a 1lb bass's throat with a small 3-4"" perch it almost swallowed...keeping in mind the 7"" snake it tried to eat!Average size bassAnd a long skinny bassShot 2Caught a lot of panfish on those shad shallow cranks by Rapala but this was a nice fish i pulled up trolling on the mouth of a bayRan up to the shore to get a pic of this bass in the eveningPerfect rod/lure shotGrass bassShot 2One of my 3lb range bassCatchAnd ReleasePhoto my my younger cousin who i taught how to fish and well made her happy3.4lb largemouth i caught on a skitter pop.Back to back bassAnother high 2lb fishThis was a very very good size smallie for this lake. I didn't even catch a second smallmouth so I was sure to get a photo and let this fish go....had to be 18-20"" long. It weighed 3.4lbs and it was skinny.3.9lbs of pure bucketmouthThis was the 2nd best highlight of my trip was catching a pike. Always loved to catch pike and for here in a foot of water this was a grand catch!3.5lbs it was but being so long in the fall this fish IMO could top 4lbs or so and well for such a small lake it brought a smile to my face, light line and no leader got this beauty in...also 1 of 4 fish we kept was this pike.Here is another pic of my cousin with a 2.10lb bassNow it's my time to shine. I went out to a deep water edge(30ft) off of a rock wall and threw out my snake as I was tying a lure onto another rod. Not expecting a hit something smashes my bait!After a hook set i was fighting this Trophy and not seeing it i thought i had to of had a pike on but to my boat came up a 21"" long 15"" girth 4.10lb largemouth bass...pure adrenalin and excitement came to my face. I also had the bass entered into the Wings Live Bait annual fishing tournament and as of now I have the second biggest largemouth bass! Thats right country fokes a Oshawa Boy came in and bumped you all down a spot That's right Team 4, 21"" + Upcoming bonus points!Tournament weigh in sign-Here's a pic of our ride when it was full and dirtyAnd a pic when of it empty and cleanThanks for reading everybody,Tightlines,MTBFEDIT*I gathered some statistics of the fish I caught. Now smaller fish were caught by my dad and brother and were not recorded but on the occasions when I went out I weighed and recorded. I have my best 5 bass, and a bass average I calculated using a Ounces to pounds equation.Main Weight/Species Chart2nd ChartI read on my map of this lake that the average was between 1-2lbs....Guess there has been a rise."

372984,Jacques,2009-08-16 00:59:00,97,Great report.  That perch looks a little uncomfortable.

373003,Cudz,2009-08-16 02:02:00,2652,"Way to go Mike.  You crushed them.  Some really nice Largies there for sure.  I had that exact same boat and caught lots of fish out of it. They are really unstable but once you get the hang of it, it does the job. You really improved on last year.  Looks like you have been studying.  Godd job bud.  You must have been stoked with that 21"" Donkey. Congrats on what looks like a fantastic holiday!"
373004,Cudz,2009-08-16 02:05:00,2652,"I was a bit scared to look at your pics as you are clearly threatening nudity with this statement (not only that, but it appears that you want us to be as well)"
373016,profisher25,2009-08-16 03:14:00,185,"WOW!!!! Looks like the most successful trip you've had this year, lots of bass, some bowfin, and finally a pike!!!
