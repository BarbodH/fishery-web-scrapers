373311,GreenCanada,2009-08-17 01:55:00,375,"I was wondering what species of fish will be up near the Norval dam? I know at the dam is a fish sanctuary, but I am curious about the bridge and below to Hwy 7. Is there trout or salmon (are salmon able to get up that far in the fall) around there still or does the Streetsville dam prevent them from getting further?  I was there last night and didn't have much luck other than a couple nice bits. So I'm just curious  Thanks!"
