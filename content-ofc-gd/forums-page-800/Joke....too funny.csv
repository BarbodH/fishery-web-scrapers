Although not familiar with the lake, the wife decides to take the boat out.  She motors out a short distance, anchors, puts her feet up,  and begins to read her book.  The peace and solitude are magnificent.  Along comes a Fish and Game Warden in his boat.  He pulls up alongside the woman and says, 'Good morning, Ma'am. What are you doing?'  'Reading a book,' she replies, (thinking, 'Isn't that obvious?')  'You're in a Restricted Fishing Area,' he informs her.  'I'm sorry, officer, but I'm not fishing. I'm reading.'  'Yes, but I see you have all the equipment.  For all I know you could start at any moment.  I'll have to take you in and write you up.'  'If you do that, I'll have to charge you with sexual assault,' says the woman.  'But I haven't even touched you,' says the Game Warden.    'That's true, but you have all the equipment.  For all I know you could start at any moment.'     'Have a nice day ma'am,' and he left."
