Anyways,this is my first report, and my biggest bass i ever caught.   So got to Balsam lake at 6 am, water was flat,no waves, so got to try my new trolling motor at it's best performance.  After loosing few fishes the first hour, i finally got on the roll here is the result:  It weights 4 lb and 21 inch long    btw it was all thanks to this little guy: Yum Dinger Worms   Next time i will try to get the pictures on the water, as i had no camera with me today."

373317,yarik20,2009-08-17 01:59:00,4,"it was calm in the morning but did get windy later in the day, i was boiling, putting aloy on my burnt skin as i type."

373492,Cudz,2009-08-17 17:13:00,2652,"Hmm, might want to pay a bit of attention to that facebook stuff."
373588,Slayingm,2009-08-17 23:09:00,204,"Great job Yarik!  Balsam is one of my favourite lakes and we have boated over 150 Walleyes, tons of Bass (Largies and SM) and some nice pike and Lunge the past few weeks on customer trips.  That is one nice Smallie for that lake.. congrats!.... Greg."

373702,linweir,2009-08-18 03:59:00,202,"Balsam is a great lake. I fished last two weekends. Caught 5+ pd smallies each time. Last weekend fishing was slow over all, due to hot weather."
