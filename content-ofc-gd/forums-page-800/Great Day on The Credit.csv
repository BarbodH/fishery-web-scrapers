So I had to pick up the parents yesterday evening from the airport but thought I would go to my special spot on the Credit River for some daytime fishing.  Well, surprisingly I have never landed a Brown trout, though I have had many on over the past few years. I typically prefer to fish barbless hooks so I find the trout can shake the hooks easier too. Anyways, the location I was fishing doesn't have any ""special"" regulations so either way I can go barbless or not.  So to make a long story short I got to my spot around 11am and walked up the river fishing towards my sweet spot. From 11am until about 4pm I managed to catch and land 8 brown trout, and as a bonus another 5 rainbows. The largest was a brown around 13"" and rainbow close to the same. None were less than 10 and everyone of them fought like a dream! I didn't keep any, as I wasn't going home anytime soon but I had an amazing day and just wanted to share the experience of landing my first 8 browns!!  Sorry, I was on my own and I typically don't take pics when river fishing because I don't like to keep the fish out of the water while I try to take a pic."

The big guys will likely be more willing to take your lure/bait.  The only problem about that section this time of year is the tempreture.  It puts a lot of stress on the fish.  Bill."
