373978,JohnF,2009-08-19 01:09:00,3494,"Somebody shoulda shot it and put it outa it's misery - the boat, I mean. Let the idiot swim to shore or drown, whatever his midget brain can come up with as a followup act.  JF"
373982,Burning Babies,2009-08-19 01:13:00,150,Reeeeaaaallly dangerous situation.  Can't say I enjoyed it.
373984,GBW,2009-08-19 01:14:00,8460,"I was thinking of chuck the big 2, 3 or 4 prong anchor in it to ""slow it down"" for him..."
373987,bassboy,2009-08-19 01:18:00,161,What a pillock.......lucky he did not lose any appendages. Guess he dosent know what a kill switch is.....
373989,Syn,2009-08-19 01:20:00,519,"Yeah saw it earlier, I thought he was going to get run over by his own motor.  Did you see the boat video after that one? It lifted off the water like a hover craft. So cool. http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=716_1250603976"

374001,JohnF,2009-08-19 01:37:00,3494, I still cringe when I see anything like that. A friend of mine got whacked in the face by his own skeg and prop one time.  Had a near perfect imprint of the prop blades on his face. I will not tell the story of how he happened to be swimming where that could happen. Suffice it to say we were 15 years old and actually believed we were immortal.  JF
374023,TC1OZ,2009-08-19 02:19:00,987,"Didn't Forest say ""stupid is as stupid does""?  I lol'd!"
374027,kickingfrog,2009-08-19 02:24:00,8333,About 10 years ago the big hydro boats came to Barrie. I was fortunate enough to snap these shots. The driver was alright. These are scans of old prints so the quality isn't the best.      
374061,hockeyplayerz_14,2009-08-19 04:42:00,160,haha thats funny
374080,Stern Rules,2009-08-19 07:03:00,342,Some people are morons and idiots aren't they. Too bad he didn't drown.
374088,spinnerbaitking,2009-08-19 11:11:00,1622,No one in the boats there really cared about him or one if them would have put their boat in between him & his boat to stop him from getting run over Richard
374089,aplumma,2009-08-19 11:22:00,6896,I think I am in love with the blue houseboat.   Art
374099,John,2009-08-19 12:35:00,2956," Was thinkin' the same thing Art!  You know, I'm a pretty tolerant guy but what keeps coming to mind is maybe the world was lucky enough that the prop castrated him so that he wouldn't pass along the bowl of stupid he ate for breakfast to his offspring!"
