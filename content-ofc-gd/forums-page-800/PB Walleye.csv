373609,LucG,2009-08-18 00:12:00,779,"Had an amazing weekend on Nipissing and caught a new personal best walleye. It measured 26"" @ 6lbs  We did really well fishing walleye in deep waters. Approx. 30-45 ft. on a good old jig and a worm.  Also ran into alot of smallmouth once we drifted into 10-20 ft.  None stop action all day long both sat & sun.  I wish I had time to post more pics, but this is the one I'm stoked about.  "

373641,LucG,2009-08-18 01:37:00,779," Its funny you mention that, cause I noticed the same thing looking at the pic. I hadn't noticed it until I uploaded it, but it did have a distinct white mark on its tail like usual."

373765,Jonny,2009-08-18 14:23:00,1380,Nice one!  You posted a while back about places you could drive to with a canoe? Looks like you had an opportunity to get out on the big lake and you took good advantage of it! Good for you.  Somebody's going to ask you if you threw it back.

373767,LucG,2009-08-18 14:33:00,779," I was fishing past the manitou islands if your leaving from North Bay.   Yes it was! I like to keep my share of walleye to bring back for dinner, but you allways hear of how much better tasting the smaller ones are. Got some pictures, its weight and lenght, and back she went."
373769,jediangler,2009-08-18 14:38:00,1923,"Congrats on the PB Luc and good on you for releasing it. It's true, the little ones taste much better anyway."
