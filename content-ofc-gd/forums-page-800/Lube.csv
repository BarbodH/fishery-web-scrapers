373569,grinandbearit30,2009-08-17 22:07:00,50,"I use KY on my ""outboard""."
373578,HTHM,2009-08-17 22:32:00,4082,"Poor solitary you, I use mucus..... I think the lube points can be noted by the GREASE nipples along the shaft of your motor.....I think grease is the word.... *I know, I know, very punny*"
373586,scugpg,2009-08-17 22:59:00,1373,I use Amsoil marine grease on my bearings and motor http://www.amsoil.com/storefront/gwr.aspx about $9 a tube
373625,Muskieman,2009-08-18 00:59:00,2472,"Red Teck ..Ultra Tacky.....about 7.00/ tube.  AMAZING stuff NOT to be used in WINTER dissipates heat like no other. Awesome for wheel bearings. I sell cases of the stuff to the Marinas and Truckers , Farmers or anybody who may need a Lube Job.   RFS   Happy Lubing!!...Remember to wipe the NIPPLES clean afterward ...If you don't , the NIPPLES tend to collect debris ... You might accidentally inject unwanted particles into the movements upon your next Lube Job."
