I head out sometimes and use the trolling motor for 3-4 hours straight and never have a problem. This is not the proper way to do it, but I don't want the excess weight on the boat from having 2 batteries."

374154,Billy Bob,2009-08-19 14:54:00,5865,There are dual purpose batteries like the Delco Voyager battery that works great in these situations. I have one on my boat now for about 8-9 years.......so long I really can't remember how old it really is.  Bob
