373333,rbaquial,2009-08-17 02:41:00,968,"Hey Folks,  Just curious... Has anyone heard of the ABU GARCIA AMBASSADEUR C5 Series?? I've never heard of it.... just off this ""1"" particular place.  If anyone has, lemme know...I'm not too sure it even exists?  :dunno:  I'm only asking because back when I was in the market for a ROUND BAITCAST REEL, I never came across this name/model. Maybe discontinued??????  Thanks, Rob"
373335,Syn,2009-08-17 02:56:00,519, A few hits show up on google. Mag X Some dating back to 2002  http://fishing.about.com/library/weekly/ne...ws020204abu.htm   Don't see a C5 at the Abu site http://www.abugarcia.com/cat.php?k=132487&sk=132487  Saw a few c5 hits on ebay too.
373402,Roy,2009-08-17 12:33:00,13728,"I have one. It's an excellent reel. If you can find one, buy it. "

373581,Fish Farmer,2009-08-17 22:47:00,2234,"I have a C3 6500, C4 6500 & 2 C3 7000 for rigger fishin. The 2 6500, I had to change to a bigger handle. Better retrieve under load. I take it the C5 is a narrower reel by the picture Roy posted. All I can say, nice reels,I wished my 7000 had a counter."
373665,bow slayer,2009-08-18 02:12:00,1074,I bought one last year at CTC on sale half price. great reel.

373694,Cudz,2009-08-18 03:28:00,2652,"Serioulsy?  Where can I find this?  Do yo have to be a member or pay a monthly/yearly fee?  Your other option, if you have a question about a fishing reel, is to ask on OFC.  That is what I would do.  It is afterall a fishing forum.  Legit question A2F."

373741,Cudz,2009-08-18 12:50:00,2652,"It is ok to be ignorant.  That is not a crime.  Neither is slothfulness.  He clearly knew it existed at some point but obviously wanted to know if it was a whorthwhile reel.  Again, legit question."
373826,Canuck2fan,2009-08-18 17:47:00,1444, If what you are looking is available anywhere in Canada these guys will have it.... or something darn close. The only drawback is the 25.00 minimum order in the showroom. However you can usually find something to buy to make up the difference. I have had a couple of issues finding different threads over the years and they have always had it even when the manufacturer said it wasn't available any longer LOL.  http://www.spaenaur.com/
373833,rbaquial,2009-08-18 17:59:00,968," Thanks Cudz - I DID have intention on looking it up - but it was only AFTER I posted the thread, that I realized I was being Lazy/Ignorant."
