It has a 24 volt trolling motor set up in bow with on board charger and a fish finder running off the power here as well. Wondering if anyone knows a boat mechanic or someone good with boat electronics who I can get to explain a few things about the electrical to me. I am in Barrie but don't mind driving an hour or so to get to the right guy. I have basic questions like how the onboard charger works ( I have never had one before), what I can hook up to the system and a few other questions. If you know someone who can help me or if you can help I would appreciate it. Thanks, Ryan"

He's the guy the marina's go to when they can't figure out the problem...lol...he's near pier 69, small shop.  Maureen"
