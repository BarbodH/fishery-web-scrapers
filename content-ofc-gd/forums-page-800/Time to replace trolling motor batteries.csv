My 2 Interstate 27's are at the end of life (7 years old) and I want to get something quick (this week). Would prefer to get a maintenance free battery if possible. Looking for 27 size again and need 2 for 24V system.   Was at CTC this morning before week and they're standard deep cycle is $140. Good reviews but would like to see what else is out there/  Any info is appreciated. Anyone ever buy from a battery place just in behind Fishing world in Hamilton I think its on Kenora Ave  Still not convinced the $ on orbital batteries equals the better performance."
