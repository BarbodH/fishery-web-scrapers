373633,Rizzo,2009-08-18 01:19:00,4754,I know this because I just canceled my plans to go fishing tomorrow based on the forecast.
373637,Terry,2009-08-18 01:27:00,14456,"yeah, that always works out for me ....yeah...  but good luck"
373743,Rizzo,2009-08-18 12:53:00,4754,"just as it always happens...scared off by a forecast (lightening lightening and more lightening) that doesn't come true. When will I learn to not trust the weatherman? Even if it starts now, I still would have had a solid 3 plus hours in great conditions"
373748,JohnF,2009-08-18 13:00:00,3494," If it makes you feel any better, it poured here starting around sunup. The rain is very localized this year though. Yesterday it came down in buckets at my office mid-morning yet nothing but dark clouds at my house a mile away.  JF"
373790,hendrix,2009-08-18 16:13:00,61,"i was taught that rain is great for some fish, especially walleye... the crappier the weather the better"
373848,Rizzo,2009-08-18 19:36:00,4754,"rain is not the problem, it was all the lightening that was predicted. Pouring rain in 85 degree weather is actually nice (and good for the fishing). It appears that today was the perfect day"
373908,dnb_cbr,2009-08-18 22:21:00,61,"you know what they say....""rain before seven, gone by eleven"""
