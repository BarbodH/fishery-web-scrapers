739842,vinnimon,2012-10-27 02:59:00,2593,"Once again for a third year in a row,I would like to announce that myself and my daughters will be hosting this contest again  I would personally like to thank everyone that has donated prizes last year, and asking them if they wish to donate again this year  All the info will be listed below for all that are not familiar with the contest.  Start date Dec 25/2012 End date march 15/2013(or the day huts have to be pulled out of lake simcoe)  Rules: 1: have fun and play safe, dont go to extremes for a photo oportunity. 2: Must be you in the picture while ice fishing. If there is no ice in your area, no problem, time stamp the photo and pm me the info. 3: Fish do not have to be in the picture, just yourself. An advantage if there is. 4: Keep it clean, for yours and my kids sake 5: HAVE FUN  For those that dont know and a reminder as well. My daughters are the judges, their decisions are final, I have no part in that  We are only doing this for the sake of winternet. The only gain thats received is a good laugh or smile from everyone  Thank you once again from myself and my girls for a wonderful 2 years, lets make this year even better  Anyone that wishs to donate prizes again this year, post it or just pm me. I would also like to add that there will be first, second and third place prizes again this year  Cheers Vince"
