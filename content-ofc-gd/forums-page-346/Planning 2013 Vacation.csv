751806,Musky or Specks,2012-12-14 17:14:00,2710,So Im low man on totem pole for choice of vacation time. I'm going to take off for a week to Algonguin on the May 24 weekend. I don't want to be there for the 24 weekend however. Ill plan to arrive there on the Monday. From the Friday to the Sunday I'd like to float tube for Minden/Haliburton Area Rainbows to see what I can accomplish(something different for me). Looking for PM's and advice on the how(public) and where to go (PM) if I could get that kind of advice from knowledgable board members. Thanks in advance.  Brad
