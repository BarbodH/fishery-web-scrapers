750852,misfish,2012-12-10 21:59:00,29133,I was lucky enough to get the proper charger for the 12v gel batteries. I have the ones from the emergency exit signs.    I like yer positive thinking.

750861,misfish,2012-12-10 22:12:00,29133,"Yes Dave they do.Thing is today,they are running them at 6v now. You would need to hook them up to make 12v.No biggie. I always have two batteries when Im out."
750880,Fisherman,2012-12-10 23:02:00,7201,"Davey buoy, after hunting I'm pretty sure what you need to make a cord is in the second picture down at the link( or something close in size). The end that would normally plug into the small 8AA pack, would plug into that connector hooked up to a 12V Gell battery.  Then you can flipflop back and forth as you wish.  Maybe the old Radio Shack over on Little Ave might just have that."
750882,davey buoy,2012-12-10 23:08:00,5505," Thank you,I was thinking something along that line. Will drop by on the way home tomorrow!"

751072,davey buoy,2012-12-11 19:53:00,5505,"Fisherman,tried finding connectors but to no avail. Terry you were right,cut the lead to the AA battery box at about 3"",put male spade connectors at that end,female connectors on the main lead from the transducer. Best of both worlds,slip the line connector to the gel battery,or to the end plug and use with AA batteries when need be.I like it,thanks everyone! I also think the charger for $19.99 is a must,it has a shut down with a maint charge.No need to worry about forgetting to unplug the charger. $34.99 for the battery,7ah."
751081,Burtess,2012-12-11 20:43:00,901,Did you get the charger and battery from BPS?  There is one on Cabelas.ca for $45 including charger. I am debating to go this way and buy the finder and stuff separately or buy an Elite4 Ice Machine and be done with it  Burt
751087,davey buoy,2012-12-11 20:53:00,5505," No Burt,I think it might be a Christmas gift,lol.It is easy enough to change over. My problem was that this unit works well in the summer,and apparently just as well in the winter. One unit for all seasons. Make sure it is a smart charger."
751089,misfish,2012-12-11 21:01:00,29133,"Heres the battery and proper charger for these batteries.      The charger has aligator clips.  It is also a gel cell charger.   Rechargeable Sealed Lead-Acid Batteries and Chargers Chargers  Chargers automatically switch between a fast charge and maintaining the charge level. They have an LED mode indicator, two-prong plug, and 3-ft. leads with alligator clips. Operate on 120-240 VAC, 50/60 Hz (except 7448K79 operates on 120 VAC only). To select the right charger, match your battery's voltage and amp-hour rating to the battery charger's output voltage and amp-hour rating.

750154,davey buoy,2012-12-08 12:50:00,5505,"The standard batteries in my Eagle Fish Easy 245ds requires 8 AA batteries. I already know that unit is ok for ice fishing even with the standard transducer. My question would be, should I get a gel battery for winter use?, Will they have the right hook up to the unit?,and how much of a difference do they make?. I take it they come with a charger of some sort?. Thanks again for any help."
750155,Terry,2012-12-08 13:01:00,14456,aa has a Nominal Voltage of 1.5 X 8 12 volts yup a 12v gel would work great I think total battery in barrie can set you up BPS has them with charger Misfish might have info on them too you can make a hook up real easy from the 8 aa hook up and you will love how long it will last
750156,davey buoy,2012-12-08 13:03:00,5505," Thanks Terry,is the need for a gel battery because the AA batteries don't like the cold?"
750162,Terry,2012-12-08 13:49:00,14456,No/yes/maybe the 12v will give the unit better voltage and aa type batteries don't like the cold
750168,davey buoy,2012-12-08 14:23:00,5505,Would a 7 ah battery be a good choice? or a different size?
750201,Terry,2012-12-08 16:25:00,14456,"That is good. The 9 ah is the same size but a little better, but I use the 7ah one"

750206,Roy,2012-12-08 16:58:00,13728,"For the rare times I've needed to use a finder in another boat than mine, (AKA a lodge boat or rental boat) I have a 7.5AH 12 volt in the home security system plus a spare battery. The home system is always on charge via the plug in transformer. I just swap out the batteries as needed."
750207,Terry,2012-12-08 16:58:00,14456,I could be wrong LOL
750325,BillM,2012-12-09 02:51:00,17367,"All the batteries that come with the portable units usually are 7ah.  They work just fine out on the ice.  9ah, even better just more run time."
750354,davey buoy,2012-12-09 11:14:00,5505,Any ball park figure on cost of battery and charger?
750356,Roy,2012-12-09 11:48:00,13728," This will give you an idea. http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B0006OBOFK/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new  You can get the battery anywhere from $20 to $40. Most people have correct size transformers in a drawer somewhere, purchased with an appliance they no longer use."
750359,davey buoy,2012-12-09 11:52:00,5505," Thanks Roy,very helpful."
750364,Billy Bob,2012-12-09 12:14:00,5865,YEARS ago I used a motorcycle battery in my ice unit....but now I use one of these....on sale with charger for $27.99  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cabelas-Rechargeable-12-Volt-Battery/700551.uts?Ntk=AllProducts&searchPath=%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch.cmd%3Fform_state%3DsearchForm%26N%3D0%26fsch%3Dtrue%26Ntk%3DAllProducts%26Ntt%3Dbattery%26WTz_l%3DHeader%25253BSearch-All%2BProducts&Ntt=battery&WTz_l=Header%253BSearch-All+Products
750367,Rich,2012-12-09 12:26:00,3927,"I use a quad battery from walmart.. Cost about 30 bucks. Boat charger works on it, and it lasts several days."
750369,davey buoy,2012-12-09 12:30:00,5505, I guess a normal battery charger is way overkill?. Kinda like the plug in type charger though. That's not a gel battery Rich?
750372,Rich,2012-12-09 12:34:00,3927,"No, its just a deep cycle. The gel versions were much more expensive. I have 3 different 12v chargers for my boat batteries so i didnt want to opt for something that had a whole new charger. The plug-in ones with the cabelas batteries will overcharge if left on too long."
750375,Terry,2012-12-09 13:02:00,14456,"I find that lots of chargers will not see the battery amps are too small, in many cases you need under a 1 amp charger"
750410,Sinker,2012-12-09 14:46:00,8692,"I charge mine with my deep cycle battery charger on the 2A setting. Works fine so far. Going on my 5th season this year. I use it all winter, and a few times in summer when I need a portable unit. I also run my running lights on my boat off the smaller battery in the fall for duck hunting so I don't have to drag around my big battery for no reason. Works great.  S."
750814,davey buoy,2012-12-10 20:28:00,5505,"Forgot guys to mention it's portable. I know I mentioned batteries but finding out now with the different connectors may not be as easy.Two separate connections from the transponder.Is there a adapter for the plug to the battery,as the other wire goes to the screen?. Maybe I'm missing something,but a gentleman today said if it was the fixed mount no problem. Thanks for any help."
750835,Fisherman,2012-12-10 21:37:00,7201,"Yes if it's a fixed mount it's easier, however, don't despair.  I think its on page 29 of the manual it shows the ""extra"" connector, it goes between the 8AA battery pack connector and the plug that goes into the back of the Unit.  It's the little receptacle end you might have a bit of a problem finding, usually called a chassis mount connector.  Anyway, you can splice 2 more wires into that present short wire connector to get you to your 12V Gell battery, add a 3A fuse and you're good to go. Another method I did for a friend of mine who had a similar one, we carefully soldered 2 wires in parallel to the ones that come out of the 8AA pack to hook up to the 12V battery.  You handy with the soldering iron?"
750841,davey buoy,2012-12-10 21:42:00,5505," I can solder,but would I only have access to the gel pack now on,or will it still allow me to use AA batteries when needed?"
750845,Terry,2012-12-10 21:48:00,14456,there should be no reason why you cant put on connectors so you can use either
750848,davey buoy,2012-12-10 21:53:00,5505," I'd really like to find one of those plug in adapters.Would be a nice clean install. I'll pick up a battery at BPS tomorrow anyway,and than see what I need to rig up. Thanks."
750850,Billy Bob,2012-12-10 21:55:00,5865, Take your time...I don't think there will be much ice this year either...
