749776,NAW,2012-12-07 01:08:00,4022,That's wild for sure.  Never seen anything like that.  Any guesses at the Value?
749777,Fisherman,2012-12-07 01:14:00,7201,"I'm pretty sure it was at the CNE boatshow way back in the late 80's, and cost around $300K back then.  Best I recollect it was a front wheel drive system same as what they use in the wheel trans buses with tag axles."
