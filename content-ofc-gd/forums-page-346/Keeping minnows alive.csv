751185,funfishing,2012-12-12 01:58:00,147,"Just bought a bunch of small minnows for tomorrow from Angling Specialties, given to me in a bag with air.  Is there a way for me to keep them alive overnight without an aerator?  I'm thinking just a bucket and hopefully it won't freeze overnight..."
751186,MJL,2012-12-12 02:02:00,2427,Don't open the bag and keep it in a cool place...They'll live overnight in the bag with no problems.  I keep my minnows in the garage or basement overnight.
751188,funfishing,2012-12-12 02:13:00,147,"There's a lot of them in there, but I will take your advice because it doesn't require any additional effort on my part and I am pretty tired after a long day."
751189,Joey,2012-12-12 02:26:00,9122,"Ya, I just keep them in the bag and put them in the fridge.  They're fine the next day!"
751190,funfishing,2012-12-12 02:29:00,147,"Fridge that's a great idea! I was going to leave them in my car, at -4, could end up an ice cube. Don't have a garage, so to the fridge they will go."
751195,lakemaster,2012-12-12 02:42:00,36,They wont die just dont open it and keep the in a cold place
751212,GBW,2012-12-12 04:20:00,8460,minnows are better in the cold so if it was ME; they would be in the car over night rather that the fridge at this time of year.  that bag will not freeze over night.  PS; read this post... http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=66803
751220,funfishing,2012-12-12 09:15:00,147,"Due to laziness they remained in the car, will see tomorrow how they ended up. I am now second guessing whether or not oxygen was pumped into the bag, I don't think it was.  Thanks for the link GBW."
751261,Lunker Larry,2012-12-12 14:52:00,122,"Years back I bought an aquarium pump, hose and aerator stone at Walmart and it cost me around $12. Use it all winter in my garage here in Ottawa. The odd time when it is really cold I have to break the ice off the stone, but other than that, it keeps everything alive. Spend a few bucks and relieve your anxiety. Too easy!"
751572,ch312,2012-12-13 15:42:00,1590, x2  it has to be pretty cold to freeze stuff that's inside your insulated car. -4 last night and a 1/4 full water bottle wasn't even frozen this morning...
751574,funfishing,2012-12-13 15:49:00,147,"A few were dead but for the most part they were alive just fine. There was hardly any air in the bag so I was surprised.  As per the other thread, I salted the heck out of them after use and put them in the freezer for future use.  Thanks again for the tips everyone."
751578,wormdunker,2012-12-13 15:58:00,1711,During the hardwater season I put my minnows in a large plastic tote out in the garage.  I have a small pump used to spit water from an ornamental turtle from my fish pond.  I raise the discharge hose out of the water so it splashes & creates bubbles.  Minnows are good for several weeks.  Very few will die.  If your water is too warm just add some ice cubes.  Hope this helps for the future.
