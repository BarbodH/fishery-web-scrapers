Distance doesn't really matter, I am located in port perry.  Fish species... probably prefer lakers, pike or walleye or combination of any of those 3. Not completely set on that just looking for something new and fun with lots of fish. I would love to hear your suggestions.  Thanks"
750114,bare foot wader,2012-12-08 04:20:00,1354,"nipissing and temagami are the obvious choices, lots of info online   but I've been itching to plan a trip to this place, now that there are no hut operators on big ab...do you have a portable to tow behind your sled?  http://www.perrylakelodge.com/"
750138,Moosebunk,2012-12-08 08:36:00,3970,BFW... Echoing that on the Ab!  We used to enjoy Tamar on Temagami but the fishing there can be tough.  Having a sled or quad opens things up too.  Renting a cabin or cottage on some good fishing lake in ON or PQ can sometimes offer up great fishing.
750215,bare foot wader,2012-12-08 17:39:00,1354,"yep, abitibi has some good fishing  Lunkerhunter - with a sled and portable hut, you'd open up a lot of possibilities"
751205,Lunkerhunter,2012-12-12 03:13:00,455,"Hey guys. I have a sled and portable and Truck to tow it all. Haha. I have done temagami, I was looking for something different then that.  @moosebunk would you have any suggestions in Quebec? That may be a good little adventure.  Any ideas welcome. Feel free to pm if you would like.  Thanks for the suggestion bfw I will look into that."
751209,Tayzak15,2012-12-12 03:34:00,318,"I would suggest Nighthawk lake just east of timmins, Theres no lodge there but we always seem to pull out monster walleyes, pike and saugers"
751213,ctdd2006,2012-12-12 04:21:00,531,Really?  Fished that big pond this fall and said never again.....
751218,Tayzak15,2012-12-12 05:13:00,318, where on the lake were you? Many locals set up their huts there. I go there once or twice per year and always do good.
