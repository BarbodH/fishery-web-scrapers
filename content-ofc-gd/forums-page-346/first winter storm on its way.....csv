750597,BillM,2012-12-10 01:19:00,17367,It's nasty up here now folks!
750599,Gerritt,2012-12-10 01:27:00,6129,"And here people mock the fact you try and inform others..... I drove my.son home.early... So niether myself, my.ex... Nor my son had.to.deal with this....freezing rain here...  Good luck to all of you who have family out in this weather....  G"
750603,Fisherman,2012-12-10 01:29:00,7201," Lets look at it in a slightly different manner. If there were no one driving on the road and it was a complete skating rink, would there be any collisions?  No, so why blame the icy conditions, blame the idiot drivers that can't seem to understand that slowing down a modest 10k would make more sense.  Oh and I'm not ragging on you kickingfrog."

750617,dhickey,2012-12-10 02:25:00,1038,Thanks Jerrit I made it home with my new/used 2 man portable ice hut just in time to watch everything turn to slushy ice that was about 3hours ago. Now its all just ice and my hut is set up in my livingroom..  Fishing is a little slow but it will get better  Don.
750652,funfishing,2012-12-10 05:36:00,147,"Drove from Ottawa to Toronto leaving around 6pm..encountered all forms of precipitation just as expected. One 18 wheeler in a ditch and one car in a ditch were the only accidents I saw from 416 to DVP. Was able to do 70 most of the time, 100 once I hit Port Hope area. Most people seemed to be driving at safe speeds.  Gas in Shannonville for 106.9"
750968,Sinker,2012-12-11 05:11:00,8692,Hmmmm.....some storm eh??
750971,irishfield,2012-12-11 05:40:00,26272," HEY.. I almost slipped and fell during that 18 foot walk to work! (1/2"" thick freezing rain up here!)"
750398,Gerritt,2012-12-09 14:12:00,6129,Just a heads up to anyone on the road today.... Please take it easy!
750402,outllaw,2012-12-09 14:27:00,1232,"rain here. im in the banana belt southern ont or northern u.s.a.,but we dont talk funny YET"
750404,funfishing,2012-12-09 14:30:00,147,I'll be driving over 1000km today...oh joy
750406,NAW,2012-12-09 14:31:00,4022,"""First"" winter storm of the year?  This will be the second for my area.  We had over a foot of snow the other week."
750407,Sinker,2012-12-09 14:37:00,8692,"I haven't seen a proper winter storm in years.  So its going to snow a little, maybe a bit of rain, and worst case, freezing rain. No big deal.  What is with the weather guys.....they hype up all these minor systems to make people think its going to be the storm of the century. Drives me NUTS!!  Kinda like Sandy. So we got a bit of wind, and some rain.....wow....that was scary. Good thing everyone went out and bought generators and stocked up on food for a week. What a joke!!  I'll believe the weather when I see it. Until then, I can only use it as a guideline on where I'm going to hunt or fish that particualar day.  S."
750409,Handlebarz,2012-12-09 14:41:00,3790,Last Thursday I was mowing my lawn and took a video of it to send my brother in northern Saskatchewan he was not impressed as he has already used his snowblower 18 times and shovelled 8 more times
750415,whiskywizard,2012-12-09 14:57:00,305," They have to do that, make a big deal of the forecasted storms, or the people who aren't prepared and can't cope well will let themselves get into deep trouble."
750417,Sinker,2012-12-09 15:01:00,8692," Too bad for them!! Suck it up buttercups! Maybe if they had to suffer a little, they would toughen up and learn how to cope with a bit of snow. I mean, we all managed to survive somehow all this time........  I will bite my tongue now. This drives me NUTS!!  S."
750418,bigugli,2012-12-09 15:03:00,6138,"Another ""much ado about nothing"" weather report. I'll still be turning soil next week."
750420,BillM,2012-12-09 15:11:00,17367, Would love some more white stuff on the ground!
750426,Rod Caster,2012-12-09 15:39:00,5784,There roads were brutal yesterday and still today around NBay. Accidents everywhere. I guess this post was meant for southerners haha
750429,mr blizzard,2012-12-09 16:01:00,1589,"Be safe back there on the roads.  THATS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YELLOWKNIFE. WE HAVE 2 SEASONS> Summer and winter.  Minus 37 c this morning. Have had snow since before Halloween.  No sloppy messy stuff here, beats the crappy stuff we had do deal with in Barrie for 18 years.  Awesome winters, awesome summers.  Been ice fishing for 4 weeks."
750430,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-09 16:32:00,2582,  Who pooped in your cornflakes this morning Shayne   Just ribbing you buddy.  I think you need an extended hunting or fishing intervention.
750432,misfish,2012-12-09 17:04:00,29133,"When you can see just the tip of the roof,THATS A SNOW STORM. Right Shane."
750433,Sinker,2012-12-09 17:10:00,8692," I'm just sick of the hyped up weather forcasts. They never hype up the nice weather, but if there is even a chance of rain or snow, its the end of the world    Now your talking! Bring it on! I have photos of my dad standing on top of the cab of his pick up reaching for the top of the snowbanks. He couldn't reach  Now THATS a snow storm!! Remember we used to measure snow in feet.....not cm's.  Bring it on I say! The more the better!! Colder that a witches bra and snow by the foot! We'll see who's complaining then!! It won't be me!!  S."
750437,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-09 17:25:00,2582, 49 and I've still never been given a scientific measurement for that.  Just how cold are we actually talking? Can you ball park me a number for that
750448,Sinker,2012-12-09 18:05:00,8692,If it stays below -20 for over a week.....  S.
750449,funfishing,2012-12-09 18:14:00,147,"I was on the road during Sandy in southern Ontario. I saw downed trees, broken traffic lights, power outages. Someone died in Toronto from falling materials due to high wind. Sandy was a horrific storm.  The upcoming system is going to be the first of the season for millions of Ontarians. The more warning people get, the less accidents. I'm all for weather warnings, they can save lives."
750476,Fisherman,2012-12-09 19:34:00,7201," Now that would be the last thing I'd do, heads up and you get a snotbox full of snow and ice pellets. But like a few of the others said, I think everyone north of #7 is getting tired of the weather nets yodeling and yammering of what's coming.  It's Canada and borderline winter so get with the program, get winter tires and learn how to drive.  If ya can't do that, then either stay home, get into the ditch right away or take transit."
750480,Gerritt,2012-12-09 19:45:00,6129,*note to self* never give my peers a heads up if they are heading out and freezing rain is being called for and they did not know....  My bad.
750482,Fisherman,2012-12-09 19:50:00,7201," Hahahaha, that's the way, they'll all be in the ditch and you'll have an empty road to drive on."
750487,Gerritt,2012-12-09 20:08:00,6129, And hope no one is seriously hurt......
750489,Sinker,2012-12-09 20:12:00,8692," No worries Gerrit. I'd be willing to bet everyone knows about the weather that's ""supposed"" to come though. Its all over the TV, radio, and internet. Unless they're living in a cave somewhere, they had to of heard about ""the first winter storm"" of the year.  My bet is we get nothing worth worrying about.  S."
750497,lew,2012-12-09 20:25:00,12766,Twice in the last couple weeks I've heard the weather dood on Global saying this winter will be quite cold with plenty of snow for our little corner of the world.  Then last week I saw David Philips on the TV saying he expects another rather mild winter for Ontario.  These forecasters are always good for a chuckle.
750513,i2cool2fool,2012-12-09 21:04:00,349,"Hey Gerritt, I appreciated the heads up. Thanks."
