750083,Live2fish85,2012-12-08 02:35:00,1633,Nice work. Those are some nice fish you got there.
750139,Moosebunk,2012-12-08 08:39:00,3970,"Lots of goods there man!  Mackerel, snook, red, bass... Solid fishing.  You do stick that tongue out alot too.  Every now and then you probably slip up and lick an armpit I'm betting. lol."
750226,lickmyarmpit,2012-12-08 18:31:00,359,Thanks for the props fellas. The second last one is a cuda check out her teeth imagine what one of those could do to a twenty dollar musky bait.  Bunk my mom always told me if I keep making that face one day it would stay like that I guess she was right after all.
