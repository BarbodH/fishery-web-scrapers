751193,Eazy,2012-12-12 02:38:00,260,"All this  ever increasing cold weather has inevitabaly got me and a lot of my fellow anglers thinking about the fast approaching hardwater season, and, (speaking for myself) LAKERS!  I would have to say my personal favorite for hardwater season Lakers is first, the tube jig,in either white or chartreuse,and sometimes just as deadly, the ABU KOSTER (if you have them).  However, sometimes if the bite slows down, usually mid February or so, I'll drop the presentation size down to a 1/4oz Buckshot Rattle Spoon, tipped with just a tiny piece of minnow."

751204,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-12 03:08:00,10439,White tube jig and airplane jigs are my top two baits. Number 3 is a large gold williams whitefish. All baits tipped with a chunk of cisco.
