751016,4x4bassin,2012-12-11 17:03:00,1025,I know this sounds simple but i'm looking for something to hold my bucktail jigs in place and not allow them to bounce around into each other. I have invested a decent amount of money on these big bucktails for my lake trout jigging and I am finding that they are rubbing on each other causing the paint/hair to get damaged . Is there a box or something out there that will allow me to store/secure them individually and stop them from bouncing around ? I made a small jig box with foam and a box tray (works half decent)but was thinking there might be something better out there . Thanks

751022,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-11 17:29:00,10439,"I coat all of my jigs with Softex. I was having issues with all of my Meegs being depainted, but no more. It provides a clear ruberized coating that protects them nicely. It is tough to ship so you might try to find it through your local fly shop as it is used to make tough heads on flies that are to be used on toothy critters.    Available @ Bass Pro Shops"
751043,Christopheraaron,2012-12-11 18:55:00,3525,  You use it on the hair?  
751049,BillM,2012-12-11 19:00:00,17367," No, just the heads."
751050,Christopheraaron,2012-12-11 19:02:00,3525," Then how would it protect the hair, if that's what he's most concerned about..."
751055,BillM,2012-12-11 19:11:00,17367," That stuff is like hard epoxy, put that on a hair jig and you've ruined it."
751083,bare foot wader,2012-12-11 20:46:00,1354,"a large saltwater fly box sounds like it would work well, but they're pretty pricey for what you get  a google search will find you lots:  http://www.orvis.com/store/product.aspx?pf_id=7597   I made my own, I dremmel tooled the tray dividers out of a large plano box, bought some 1/2"" thick sheet foam at a craft shore, used marine goop to hold it in...nice and big, I prefer the thicker foam for the larger hooks, lasts longer too...drilled holes all around the sides for ventilation  keeps them securely separated so they don't bump and chip paint away...and wet bucktail/fur won't bleed colours to other jigs...I keep new jigs and at one end of the box and used wet jigs on the other side"
751132,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-11 22:58:00,10439,Yes on the heads to protect the finish. It protects the paint from rocks and fish teeth too!!!
751177,4x4bassin,2012-12-12 01:19:00,1025,"Those boxes are exactly what i'm looking for , I will check them out . That softex stuff looks really good as well for protecting the jig heads , I am going to try and find some and your right Drifter after a couple ""snaggle tooth"" lake trout the heads can get scratched up pretty good ! Thanks"
751207,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-12 03:24:00,10439," You can either dip them or paint the stuff on with a model paintbrush. If yo dip them clean out the eyes before the stuff hardens (doesn't take long).  Might want to do it in the garage, with the door open. The stuff is pretty stinky and you get light headed if you use it in an enclosed space."
