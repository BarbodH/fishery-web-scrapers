751383,fishnsled,2012-12-12 21:22:00,3520, I'm surprised that Joe got some pictures posted let alone any video.

751412,Rattletrap2,2012-12-12 22:37:00,1652,  LOL. These were my first thoughts! I'd also be afraid she might panic and end up in the pool! That would not be fun!
751413,Headhunter,2012-12-12 22:48:00,5703,  Bah ha!!!!!You aint kidding! HH
751445,Toad Hunter,2012-12-13 00:57:00,261,"I remember a couple years back a deer ran (smashed) through a diner window in downtown Kitchener- with all the urban sprawl, where do they all go ??"
751311,Headhunter,2012-12-12 18:23:00,5703,"I work from my home office in Scarborough. I was starting to think what to have for lunch when my dog started to growl and huff and puff... I turn around and look in my backyard and see this!    So, I am taking reservations from the cross bow/bow hunters who would like to stake out my back deck... I'll take pepperettes as payment! HH"
751317,Headhunter,2012-12-12 18:33:00,5703,"SO far, I have tried to feed it a carrot, didn't seem interested, nor the apple... but it just did take some romain lettuce out of my hand! It's now waiting at the bottom of my stairs for more food! HH"
751323,fishindevil,2012-12-12 18:39:00,6254,awesome !!! fire up the BBQ ....im on the way...yummy bambi burgers....
751329,bushart,2012-12-12 18:48:00,2628,As it's just a fawn---have you named it---Hansel or Gretel Yet???  C'mere l'il precious and have some nice lettuce.....Muuwwaaa ha ha!!
751330,Headhunter,2012-12-12 18:49:00,5703,"Turns out that I had to cut the apple as it was too big to fit in it's mouth! So as I am cutting the apple, the silly thing walks over to me, I feed it a 1/4 apple and comence to petting the silly thing! i wish mykids were home to see this! HH"
751331,Nipfisher,2012-12-12 18:51:00,2449,"  SO far, I have tried to feed it a carrot, didn't seem interested, nor the apple... but it just did take some romain lettuce out of my hand! It's now waiting at the bottom of my stairs for more food!   No need for crossbow or bow, just a handfull of lettuce  or cut up apple and a hatchet."
751333,Nipfisher,2012-12-12 18:53:00,2449,  Tie it up and it will still be there for your kids to see.
751335,bushart,2012-12-12 18:54:00,2628,Of Course it goes without sayin that It's still a wild critter with really sharp hooves if it feels threatened in any way
751337,Headhunter,2012-12-12 19:05:00,5703,Bacon wrapped tenderloins on the BBQ.... drool.... Here deerie deerie... uncle Joe has a nice apple for yah! LOL HH
751340,myot,2012-12-12 19:19:00,131,I have a 78E doe tag left
751347,lew,2012-12-12 19:30:00,12766,"That's great Joe, always nice to see the critters around."
751348,fishnsled,2012-12-12 19:41:00,3520,Very cool Joe!  Save some of those pepperettes for Bernie's!
751349,Headhunter,2012-12-12 19:46:00,5703,"It is kinda neat when you figure I live in the country's largest city, the 401 is two minutes away and I can hear a city bus going by every 15 minutes! BTW - she doesn't like celery! I walked up to her, showed her the celery and she just snorted and wagged her head at me. I know you guys who are lucky enought to make a living and live outside of T.O are probably shaking your heads at me, but it's pretty rare for a deer to be walking around in your back yard in the city. FnS... what should I feed her next, she can self marinade for us! I wonder if she likes Franks Hot Sauce! LOL HH"
751350,BillM,2012-12-12 19:51:00,17367,"So when are you calling the MNR?  If you keep feeding her, she's not going to leave."
751353,Gerritt,2012-12-12 19:56:00,6129,Not feeding her.... Fattening her.
751354,Dozer,2012-12-12 20:03:00,896,Club it on the head and if anyone asks.... self defense  We have a lot of deer near the Bluffs. Found a couple of sheds throughout the years of bike riding around here.  Thats pretty neat that you are feeding it.
751357,Headhunter,2012-12-12 20:16:00,5703,"I'm waiting until my kids come home from school... I want them to see it. Shortly there after, I will be introducing her to my 80lb lab named Lucky... I think she may leave on her own... Thanks for the concern though... HH"
751358,irishfield,2012-12-12 20:20:00,26272,Is it sharing the Doritos yet?
751359,chessy,2012-12-12 20:21:00,610,please be carefull with your lab.. one kick to the head could be deadly to the dog.. open a gate and let her go on her own... i have seen a few dogs that have been killed by deer  (mostly beagles) the deer will only take so much
751374,Headhunter,2012-12-12 20:57:00,5703,"I plan on having the dog on a leash... I figure the second she see's the dog, she'll just jump the fence the way she came in and take off into the ravine. HH"
751377,workwear,2012-12-12 21:07:00,592,"your poor pup must be goin crazy right now.....lol....""let me att'er let me att'er!!!"""
751378,RangerGuy,2012-12-12 21:14:00,564," I think you could open your gate and just guide it out..without stressing it out by having your dog bark at it.  I would enjoy the chance to actually see some wild life other coons, coyotes and skunks in the big smoke.  Be careful and enjoy the experience, then guide her out peacefully, no need to stress her out.  Wouldn't it be cool if she was a common visitor...."
751379,Headhunter,2012-12-12 21:15:00,5703,Let's just say we have some windows that need some windex on the inside! LOL She just wandered off into the ravine behind my house... HH
751381,Christopheraaron,2012-12-12 21:16:00,3525,Cool! We saw some down our street a couple months ago. any video?
751382,outllaw,2012-12-12 21:18:00,1232,"sweet deal. i love venison,but thats a different story when bambi is in your back yard"
