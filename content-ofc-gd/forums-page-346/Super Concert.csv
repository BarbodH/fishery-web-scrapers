751786,Billy Bob,2012-12-14 15:47:00,5865,This concert was in behalf of those effected by Hurricane Sandy.....when other natural disasters happen ANYWHERE on the globe the U.S.A. is the first to respond....but when a natural disaster happens in the U.S.A. it is almost silent from the rest of the world.....the only friend I heard of that came to the aid of those in NY and NJ was our old faithful friend CANADA......  THANK YOU
751791,DoubleDigits,2012-12-14 16:07:00,140," Well, as a Canadian, you're welcome! But...when disaster strikes in the USA, usually the whole world offers assistance. Immediately after Katrina, for instance, over 80 countries around the world offered monetary and resource assistance. More than $854 million was sent or offered to assist with the disaster...Only $40 million was spent on disaster relief, $400 million (in oil) went 'uncollected', and the rest was so bound up in red tape, it never got anywhere."
