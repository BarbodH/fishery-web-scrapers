In the 70's he was still a kid but his family had season tickets at Maple Leaf Gardens. This blog post of his has photos that he took.

How could I forget the Milkman.  Thanks for that link. Kind of nice to remember back when I was a hockey crazed kid

Maple Leaf Gardens (Mattamy Centre). Next Wednesday night (19th)... $25.. tickets go on sale on Thursday.. 10am. Don't imagine they'll last long, not a lot of seats in there compared to the Glory Days.  http://www.mattamyathleticcentre.ca/events/detail/rbc-play-hockey-charity-challenge"

Spent many a night at MLG with my dad in those days when you could afford to see a great hockey game....but the coolest thing was shovelling Ian Turnbull's driveway as a kid for extra money and fishing for carp in Darryl Sittlers backyard..aka Sittlers pond.  Wayne...hope PK puts a team together soon but me thinks he could beat all those leafs by himself...hahaha"
