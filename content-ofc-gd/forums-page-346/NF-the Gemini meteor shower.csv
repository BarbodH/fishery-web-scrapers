751763,Twocoda,2012-12-14 13:44:00,4130,IT was very cold and windy looking out over Huron at 3ish this morning ...seems the good meteor displays were when the camera was pointing in the wrong direction or processing a shot...oh well ...i did manage to capture one in about the hour i was out there... It was really really windy and i didnt have anything heavy to stabilize the tri pod...next time  
751765,Moosebunk,2012-12-14 13:49:00,3970,"OK.  Didn't know there was a meteor shower going down.  Was telling Bren while watching The Big Bang Theory, that science would certainly conclude that the very thick and bright streak of white light which landed over yonder in our backyard, could have only been caused by a UFO.  She called me a white streak of light which has obviously burned out.  Dang meteors."

751768,lew,2012-12-14 13:54:00,12766,Outstanding picture Twocota !!  I was out on the back deck around 4:00 but I guess I was too late and didn't see any.
751793,4x4bassin,2012-12-14 16:22:00,1025,"I was out on the back deck around 0100-0200 and it was definitly a sight to see , I was seeing 3-10 meteorites every minute at that time and I didn't want to go inside in case I was going to miss something !!! They were mostly in the NNE lower/mid horizon and actually around 0100 I seen 4-6 meteors all at the same time traveling side by side in the same direction in the NE horizon , wish I had a camera for that will never see that again"
751794,fishindevil,2012-12-14 16:26:00,6254,"nice shot for sure,and yes it was quite the show,i seen a few that looked like they were almost comming right down to the horizon,im sure lots of pics were taken they will have it on the news tonight im sure !!!!"
751795,Rich Clemens,2012-12-14 16:31:00,3131,I like that shot.  Lots of patience I assume
