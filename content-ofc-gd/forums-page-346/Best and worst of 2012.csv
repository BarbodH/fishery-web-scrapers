So, let's' see your nominations in the Best Thread and Worst Thread categories over the past year.  Let' keep it fun though---no re-hashing of old arguments that went on, and on, and on in some of the 'worst' threads. Lets's see if we can get this rolling w/o going downhill!"
751670,Roy,2012-12-13 23:31:00,13728,This should be interesting.
751671,Terry,2012-12-13 23:32:00,14456, agreed
751672,aplumma,2012-12-13 23:35:00,6896,You got a better chance of stapling water to a tree than this making it off the first page before it goes downhill.   Please prove me wrong.   Art
751682,mike rousseau,2012-12-14 00:12:00,4661,No specific post for me...   My favorites are Limey's fishing posts/videos with his little fella in them..... Gives me experiences to look foreword with my little guy....  The worst.... All the NF threads that get 5-10 times the replies that fishing reports/questions get....  ...
751684,RickOnt,2012-12-14 00:14:00,669,"Is that ""NF""??  Maybe we should have 2 categories 'NF'  and  'F'   Rick"
751685,Nipfisher,2012-12-14 00:18:00,2449,Worst ones are the polictical threads that CAN'T be worked out because it is all opinion and all politicians are liars anyways.
751694,Stoty,2012-12-14 00:47:00,2910,"Best threads: any with fish porn in them.... Worst threads: Any post with ""Maple Leafs"" in it."
751696,kickingfrog,2012-12-14 00:58:00,8333, So almost none of yours… And about half of yours….
751697,GreenCanada,2012-12-14 01:00:00,375,Can't wait to see everyones favourites!   Best: Mike's Sutton River Journal.  I haven't seen that many amazing photos in one place ever before. What a joy it was to read and view. (Thanks again for sharing Mike)  Worst: I'll have to sleep on that.    edit: spelling mistake
751698,kemper,2012-12-14 01:02:00,2232,"The Sutton River Journal will be hard to beat, although the Tree River posts are always a favourite for me..."
751699,Rod Caster,2012-12-14 01:03:00,5784,Best: I'm split between moosebunks arctic char (others as well) and Mike/Bill's sutton river.
751700,Stoty,2012-12-14 01:08:00,2910, Goes for 90% of people on here as well. The other 10% are trolls...
751702,danc,2012-12-14 01:12:00,4677,I don't see anything good coming from this thread. Just call me Kreskin.
