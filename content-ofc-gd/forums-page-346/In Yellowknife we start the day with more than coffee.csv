751471,capt_hooked,2012-12-13 02:18:00,212,We love to brag about the cold.....   Like the time we had to build 5 foot fires under the 2000 pound propane tanks ... in order that the propane would still turn to gas from a liquid... (this at -60F).  And most stove oil.. freezes after -40C...  
751485,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-13 03:04:00,10439,How we BBQ at -40.  
751499,irishfield,2012-12-13 03:50:00,26272,LOL Dave.. why I can never figure out why people go with Propane furnaces... tried to tell my kid that. He'll learn the hard way one night!
751516,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-13 05:56:00,10439, My furnace is propane. Never had a problem though as it's beside a slight hill. It gets burried by snow early so it's well insulated.
751630,wormdunker,2012-12-13 20:44:00,1711,"I just returned from Fort McMurray.  -20 & -25 every day, -32 at night, 3' of frost in the ground & 2' of snow  BRRR! Oh yah & we worked every day! Guys are ice fishing in Ft Mac with 4x4 trucks on the ice!  Woo Hoo"

750807,Locnar,2012-12-10 20:13:00,645,Now that... is friggin cool. No pun intended
750808,kickingfrog,2012-12-10 20:16:00,8333,Works down here too. It's just not every week that it's that cold.
750824,mr blizzard,2012-12-10 21:00:00,1589,Thanks for the help Dave.
750825,davey buoy,2012-12-10 21:05:00,5505,"I heard It's a dry cold,so you don't feel it as bad!!."
750826,craigdritchie,2012-12-10 21:09:00,1586,-38??  I knew there was I reason I don't live up north.
750828,mr blizzard,2012-12-10 21:12:00,1589,"Your right, it is much drier than what we had in Barrie. I would happy fish in -35 up here than -10 back in Barrie where we had spent 18 years. Your ice fishing seasons here are guaranteed."
750832,mr blizzard,2012-12-10 21:26:00,1589, At -38 .....thats the start of our bbq season up here
750837,mr blizzard,2012-12-10 21:38:00,1589,Thanks for the assist Dave
750849,Joey,2012-12-10 21:53:00,9122,That's cool!  I remember days like that when I was a kid living in Flin Flon for a few years
750857,mr blizzard,2012-12-10 22:04:00,1589,"Joey we met briefly at fishing for Tylor a few years ago, your welcome to come up and relive the Flin Flon memories. Just bring a couple of steaks."
750862,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-10 22:13:00,10439, No problem John.
750863,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-10 22:14:00,10439, T'was -48 with the wind this mornin'.
750869,aplumma,2012-12-10 22:21:00,6896,You know what my thermometer says when you throw water up and it powders into ice?  MOVE FURTHER SOUTH.  Thats cold enough to kill a Cajun yaa know    Art
750906,Rich Clemens,2012-12-11 00:33:00,3131,We freak out when the temp drops below 0.   Can't imagine that.  Coldest down here I can recall was -25 F a number of years ago.
750915,Joey,2012-12-11 01:30:00,9122, Sounds like a good deal to me  I might just have to take you up on that offer
750919,Handlebarz,2012-12-11 01:41:00,3790,Dang I should let my brother in Saskatchewan know that his -25 was nothing today
750941,capt_hooked,2012-12-11 02:59:00,212,At -40C = -40F....  folks generally switch to F. below -40...   
750948,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-11 03:20:00,10439, Why switch? It's not like C & F are all of a sudden the same below -40  -45C = -49F -50C = -58F -55C = -67F -56.66 = -70F The boiling point of liquid nitrogen -60C = -76F -67.22 = -89F The lowest recorded temp. ever (Snag Yukon a long time ago)
750959,GreenCanada,2012-12-11 04:22:00,375,"The lowest natural temperature ever recorded on Earth was in 1983 at the Soviet Vostok Station in Antarctica, where it reached  −89.2 °C  or −128.6 °F.  But I hear it didn't feel that cold, because it was a dry cold"
750960,dhickey,2012-12-11 04:31:00,1038, Send it down my way Simcoe needs the help.
751008,capt_hooked,2012-12-11 15:53:00,212,   You have to be there....!
751010,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-11 16:26:00,10439, I am here and have experienced temps down to -57C!!! BRRRR!!!
751065,aplumma,2012-12-11 19:34:00,6896,Y'all are all making stuff up everyone knows the universe freezes at - 10F.    Art
