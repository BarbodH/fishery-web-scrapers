751364,DOS,2012-12-12 20:32:00,119,"Just wondering if this is something you would use, I got some samples in and I got to say they look impressive.  Especially the steel leader that you can tie, no crimps required...Looking for feedback to see if I will carry the full line.  http://www.aquateko.com/  red"

751367,Raf,2012-12-12 20:44:00,3495,"the swivels look gimmicky and cheap  the tieable wire seems expensive.  tieable wire has been around for a while and i think it has its place, how does it compare to tygerleader or cortland products ?"
751368,misfish,2012-12-12 20:45:00,29133,I would have to see it in person.Hard to tell how big they are. Pretty interesting though.
751370,davey buoy,2012-12-12 20:49:00,5505,"All for trying new products,but the regular swivel works well for me.Will be interesting to hear the feedback. I haven't fished big enough fish yet for that to be a option for me."
751373,kemper,2012-12-12 20:56:00,2232,Infomercials instantly destroy any credibility a product may have for me...
751384,bare foot wader,2012-12-12 21:25:00,1354,"those swivels are legit but seem to be geared more at saltwater anglers....I chartered a guide in florida uses them, he said they last longer and more durable as they don't corrode....he was using 50 lb swivels I think....also said that occasional fish will swipe at the flash of the stainless swivel and damage the mainline  I use the Rio wire tippet for fly fishing and ice fishing but based on my impression of the swivels, I'd try the wire without hesitation"
751397,Roy,2012-12-12 22:06:00,13728,I'm not impressed by either of the products.
751407,Burtess,2012-12-12 22:26:00,901,Haywire twist works for me with single strand SS when making pike quick strike rigs.... don't think I'll be changing soon just for a bit of stretch  Burt
751410,msp,2012-12-12 22:32:00,1336,"I have been using the Rio wire leader this year with great success for pike fishing. Very easy to tie a back to back uni knot , no kinking whatsoever and way more durable than flouro leaders. I do have some of the swivels but have not tried them yet. They look durable and well made. Trout guys fishing gin clear water will love them."
751423,kickingfrog,2012-12-12 23:50:00,8333,"If swivel visibility is a concern I would just make my lead longer, although the saltwater corrosion is an aspect I don't have to worry about. There are a few brands of tieable wire line out there."
751561,DOS,2012-12-13 14:54:00,119,"Thanks for the feedback guys, they look good.  Big Jim Mc really likes the stuff, just not too sure about putting a large investment out there if there isnt too much interest..  RED"
751598,JoshS,2012-12-13 17:06:00,729,The infomercial website really threw me off. What's up with that? haha
751600,funfishing,2012-12-13 17:09:00,147, Infomercials work! Do you have any idea how much money Bowflex makes?
751673,Rich,2012-12-13 23:37:00,3927,Meh. Regular swivels work for me. Don't fish muskies often enough to need anything more.
751947,GoneFishin,2012-12-15 03:50:00,349,I'd rather go with a smaller metal swivel because if I'm going to use a swivel to connect my lines then I'm going to be using a spinner or something that is constantly moving and if they dont get scarde off by your main line the swivel shouldn't bug them. If they where snap swivels though I might be interested because of there nutural buoyancy. It would be great for throwing topwater and jerkbaits.
