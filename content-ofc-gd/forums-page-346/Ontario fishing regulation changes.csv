751571,BillM,2012-12-13 15:38:00,17367," I'm sure there are a few fall spawners, but most of them are hold over fish that spawn in the spring time."
751573,Snidley,2012-12-13 15:48:00,620,"You really can fish Steelhead any time of the year as long as you don't kill them either from mishandling them or killing them for roe or a questionable feed. Unfortunately both the spoonpullers and the floaters all have rationalizations that allow their view to bang around in their essentially empty heads. Bottom line if you are killing these rare animals for bait, food or ignorant handling you are the problem."
751575,Hairpy,2012-12-13 15:56:00,73,"I think its a big misconception that the paying clients really WANT to take the fish home and that they would not get their money's worth otherwise. Its old school thinking, look around the world , doesn;t look like out west is having any decline in customers because there are special limits in place.  There are rainbows that spawn in the fall but very little , usually its a hatchery fish.  Joseph"
751580,Headhunter,2012-12-13 16:10:00,5703,"Rare invasive species! REALLY! It's put and take as you well know. Guess what, I kept two of your rare fish this year after dragging spoons for a day. Both were under 16 inches and according to my wife, they tasted dandy! (So far, she doesn't have any poisoning as a result) I think I'll change up my fishing plans for 2013 and hit my Wii game, so as to not hurt any fish! Someone pass the tofu... I've got a cedar plank just itching for the BBQ. HH"
751582,Spiel,2012-12-13 16:13:00,9065, Rare? Seriously?      
751585,Snidley,2012-12-13 16:27:00,620,"Rare seriously. The abundance of steelhead, IN ONTARIO WATERS especially our rivers, is relatively rare. On the US side, not so much. Yet their regulations are tighter. Go figure. The adult fish are unhealthy to eat on both sides of the border and yet heroes bring them home to feed their uninformed families including children and women of child bearing age. Brilliant move fellows why not chase down that contaminated fish with a smoke, a stiff drink and a line of blow. You've got to die of something might as well be tainted mushy Lake O fish."

751314,SirCranksalot,2012-12-12 18:27:00,3291,   I think you are confusing what you have a right to do with the right thing to do.
751319,kemper,2012-12-12 18:36:00,2232,"  How about this - I PERSONALLY believe that it is my responsibility as an angler to practice sustainable harvest regardless of what the MNR believes ""sustainable"" to mean.  I have no authority to ""tell"" anybody what they can or cannot due, but I certainly think that as anglers it's important for us to educate ourselves on ethical and sustainable practices.  Again, if you want to go out to the local pond and crack your limit on the noggin' every day then have at it. There is nothing anyone can say about that, if it's within the law it's within the law. I just think if we all used a little common sense here and there our kids might get a chance to experience the same (or better) fishing that we are able to."

751369,GreenCanada,2012-12-12 20:46:00,375, Couldn't agree more!  Thanks for the info Ron
751416,aniceguy,2012-12-12 23:25:00,1094,"I wear two hats these days, one is a conservation director for the CBAF and the other vice chair of CRAA I saw that zone 17-18 had made some great inroads to a regulatory change for bass and advised through the CBAF that we should also request such to the Zone 20 manager and council.  In quick fashion the science was adressed and adopted, MNR chose to also preceed with the regulatory change for Zone 20.  Great forward thinking and positive attitude towards a change really what the MNR should be about. Im pretty sure 19 and 16 will follow suit in two years, although I strongly believe Simcoe should be left out of any change due to its different spawning cycles. Now if we can get a trophy bass season on Eire to mimic NY that would be great!!( NEXT CHALLANGE MAYBE)  The second is CRAA, those that know me understand those chrome things are my pets and because they dont speak I adopted to be thier voice in southern ontario through CRAA, its members and dedicated board. It was I who with the support of the club solely that requested this change on rainbows, It is a positive change in the right direction. Thanks MNR for finally being proactive!!  If we reduce mortality via harvest by 10 % then we are on the right track personally I think this does way more. Sadly I have yet to see 5 fish recover on an ice chest or any fish recover from being mishandled regardless of malice or mis-intention..  For those that quibble about angling mortality and floaters, Im sure that like many changes we all will adapt.  500 feet of cooper usually will kill the fish as does flopping ona deck for 10 minutes, so taking time to refresh or re adapt technique that provides the best chance for a successful release should be your mantra anyhow. Eating fish in a sustainable fishery is a warranted act, if we give up that right the non anglers win, this is about helping to make a great fishery becoime a world class destination. For those that argue this change, the opportunity did exist to comment on the EBR as it did through the vast array of stakeholders in the province. Sorry if this change offends some but based on avaliable data it was the right course. milo"
751420,Locnar,2012-12-12 23:36:00,645,Reducing the Rainbow trout from 5 to 2 in Lake Ontario??? People actually keep and eat Lake Ontario fish???
751424,craigdritchie,2012-12-12 23:50:00,1586,"Great news, but I'm sorry to say this still won't stop several hundred people from bonking them anyways, thinking they're coho or chinooks or Atlantics or whatever. How many posts do we see every year where someone caught a silver fish and they're asking what the heck it is? Sad, but true fact --> a huge number of Great Lakes anglers simply cannot identify the fish they catch.  It's pathetic, and completely unacceptable, but true.  The new regs will reduce the number of rainbows killed by charter boats, which is a big plus, but I won't be surprised to see all kinds of people still killing in five rainbows a day otherwise. Hopefully the COs will spend a little more time at the ramps and weigh stations this year to get the message across."
751434,Mack66,2012-12-13 00:25:00,19,I wish they'd done something to relieve the pressure on the Scugog walleye population though.   Was just gonna say this but maybe next year the will do something.
751455,Snidley,2012-12-13 01:27:00,620,A small step forward. Still not near enough IMO. I bet the Spoonpullers are are screaming bloody murder. Charter boys would be too but they are mostly in Costa Rica this time of year chasing 2 legged quarry with paper. If only we could train the stream guys there might be some positive results from this conservationist trend.
751466,Joeytier,2012-12-13 01:49:00,3990,And you're helping the cause immensely by painting brushstrokes like that...

751505,Fish Farmer,2012-12-13 04:17:00,2234,"If you would like to know, it was a Lake Ont. charter captain that proposed the 5 down to 2 Rainbow Trout and he is a Spoonpuller member. You can go on and talk about floaters, it happens in all species. But if we don't try something, we mite as-well sell our rods and take up golf. Tell me, who would or can eat 5 Big Lake O Rainbow every day."
751508,Gerritt,2012-12-13 04:20:00,6129,  Good point! and I have to add... Who would WANT to eat 5
751509,Fish Farmer,2012-12-13 04:32:00,2234,I just edited my post Gerritt then I read your reply. I wasn't fast enough
751544,Headhunter,2012-12-13 14:08:00,5703,"This flag waving is really kinda ironic, don't ya think? We have two groups discussing these fish, with one group suggesting that their choice of fishing these fish, from a bank is nobler than the one's out on the lake, dragging lures... Fact is, if you bank guys really want to save the fish or make this area a ""world class destination"" then you would not fish during the species spawning run. Pretty simple really. They close the season for other species, yet they leave it open for plundering when it comes to steel... anyone else see the disconnect here? HH"
751545,Joeytier,2012-12-13 14:09:00,3990,Rainbows have a MUCH better chance of survival when they're not taken out of the water.  We ran large cywash hooks and just flipped them off boatside.  Never seem a floater doing that but it' almost a guarantee when you net them and let them flop around
751549,Harrison,2012-12-13 14:25:00,2202, Folks who pay hundreds of dollars to experience the catch and harvest.  The blue zone aka. bow water can save your day when the salmon bite is slow.  Especailly late season for the charters on the east end of the lake.  You may see more move west now.
751552,chessy,2012-12-13 14:30:00,610," are you telling these people they may not be edible for human consumption , these people probably don,t know ... i wanted to put a sign down at the river by the boat launch telling people be wise on what you eat and post the ""recomeneded eating guide"" i had a few boaters tell me they would rip it down. i wonder if there has ever been a lawsuit of a charter boat telling people they are good to eat.. i have heard a few of them say that at the cleaning station ?????"
751558,Harrison,2012-12-13 14:48:00,2202," Ethics, some folks have them, some don't.  I agree and know where you are coming from. Even once ethical operators complete their due dilligence, the final decision is the clients. Too bad they couldn't come with a warning label like a pack of smokes.  On that note, I like to harvest the odd shaker and one day I had an chat at the launch with a couple gents bank fishing.  One asked in disgust how I could eat fish from Lake Ontario then he lit up a smoke.  Found that funny."
751565,BillM,2012-12-13 15:08:00,17367," There are a lot of guys that don't fish spring steelhead, I've been out the odd time in the spring, but I do 99% of my steelheading in the fall.   Give them to me in the fall when they're full of piss and vinegar."
751569,SirCranksalot,2012-12-13 15:35:00,3291," From what I have read and seen, I understood that lots of bows spawn during the fall. e.g I saw 1 caught a few days ago that was totally bloated and looked ready to spawn."

751245,Fish Farmer,2012-12-12 14:15:00,2234,I feel for the tourist industry around Nippissing. Blame who! Won't say any more.
751248,Ron,2012-12-12 14:18:00,1683," To the best of my knowledge, there is still discussion on Scugog but the reg changes didn't make the books for 2013."
751251,solopaddler,2012-12-12 14:25:00,8605,Reducing the limit on rainbows from 5 to 2 in the lake is HUGE news!

751256,Rich,2012-12-12 14:44:00,3927,Wow this means... Absolutely nothing for those of us in the actual southern portion of ontario. Guess i can travel to fish bass a week earlier.
751259,Rich,2012-12-12 14:51:00,3927,Lake ontario is an hour and a half north of here..
751260,Rich,2012-12-12 14:51:00,3927,And its the LACK of nicotine talking ... Lol
751262,BillM,2012-12-12 14:53:00,17367,Awesome news about the reduction from 5 to 2 rainbows on Lake O!   No more kill boards loaded with steelhead from the bluezone!
751263,kemper,2012-12-12 14:54:00,2232,"Charter boats or not, the reduced limit on zone 20 bows is fantastic news.  Never could wrap my head around the limit of 5 - way too many boats heading out every day and coming in with 15-20 bows in a box."
751265,BillM,2012-12-12 14:57:00,17367," This is going to have a great effect on the amount of returns we see each year.  Great start if you ask me.   Now if we could protect those spawning fish a bit more, I think we'd really be headed in the right direction."
751266,grimsbylander,2012-12-12 15:09:00,3016,This is all very good news. The bass regulation change makes my wonder a bit...the Ministry stated the change due to warmer climate trends. Hawkesbury = yes...Windsor = no. And does Lake Ontario warm quicker than Erie?? I'm no biologist so I know I'm missing something. Great update regarding the rainbows for sure.
751270,chessy,2012-12-12 15:23:00,610,now that this has happened it will be interesting to see if the rainbows rebound??? i know there has been a private study going on at a river that has absolutely No fishing pressure and the rainbows have been declining  cause they have been killed or eaten in the lake NOT in the river
751272,Rich,2012-12-12 15:29:00,3927, Exactly what I was thinking. Why would an earlier bass season be encouraged in obviously colder waters than we have in the southernmost part of canada?
751273,kemper,2012-12-12 15:33:00,2232," I have no knowledge of how/where these changes start, but I would take a shot in the dark and say its possible that pressure from lodge/resort owners in our area got the ball rolling? Bass season is bread and butter for them..."
751275,kemper,2012-12-12 15:36:00,2232," No doubt we will see higher returns almost immediately, but that's not to say that more people won't be bonking fish at the river that they normally would have taken in the lake. The kill on the rivers lately has been crazy, seems like 3 fish bonked for every 1 released.  At the end of they day, educating people on sustainable harvest is the best option. Until we can dispose of the Neanderthal gene that leads us to indiscriminately smash everything that swims over the head with a stick limit changes like this will have to do."
751278,Headhunter,2012-12-12 16:00:00,5703,"From 5 per day down to 2 for Lake O steelies... to me, that means there's gonna be a lot more floaters in the blue zone, then there ever were! Let's face it, a good percentage of fish caught in that area, simply don't survive being caught. So now, folks will ""cull"" their catch and there will be chrome floating everywhere. Just so the river folks can beat them with a stick, gut them for their eggs and leave on the bank. Personally, I don't really care about the reduced number, it won't effect me personally, but I bet that we won't see much of a change in returning steel as a result of these changes. HH"
751280,young_one,2012-12-12 16:03:00,620, I agree with the floaters
751281,fishindevil,2012-12-12 16:03:00,6254,"well said headhunter !!! more floaters in the blue zone as a result,but guys are forgetting the massive reduction in stocking as well,as the cormorant issue!!!! the numbers will stay the same..."
751284,chessy,2012-12-12 16:11:00,610,"if the floaters become a issue then the next step is to say if you catch it you kept it.. if the survival rate of a released fish is zero like is being said then it should be considered a caught and kept fish and the MNR should step up enforcement (never see it) and if the people care about the fishery as much as they say then they wont fish the blue zone as from my limited knowledge trout and salmon feed in different temperatures  Studies have shown that rainbow trout can survive being caught and released (Klein 1965; Horak  and Klein 1967, Reingold 1975, Mongillo 1984, Taylor and White 1992). While artificial and egg  baits generally result in less than 10% mortality, other natural baits can result in mortalities of up to  50% (Mongillo 1984).  "
751289,kemper,2012-12-12 16:24:00,2232," Since when has any Ministry been able to make perfect decisions that are in the best interests of all parties involved...  I agree, if people are within the law then nobody can say a thing - everyone has the privilege of harvesting their limit.  BUT - a little education goes a long way. Whacking two fat females every time you go out is within the law, but certainly not sustainable."
751297,SirCranksalot,2012-12-12 17:08:00,3291,Why not reduce from 5 to 2 in all the lakes. Who the heck needs to keep 5 bows??
