751004,Joey,2012-12-11 15:25:00,9122,Those damn voices do it every time
751030,bigugli,2012-12-11 18:18:00,6138, Best thing to do is take the lead and put it out for discussion. Don't need to be admin to organize a GTG.
751033,Headhunter,2012-12-11 18:26:00,5703,The standard rules apply so I'll say it... NO PICS NO GTG! HH
751044,Christopheraaron,2012-12-11 18:56:00,3525, 
751051,Handlebarz,2012-12-11 19:02:00,3790,Gerritt  Huh sure sums up what I put Earlier today and I sure love AutoCorrect. What I was trying to say is I was talking to squid On the cell phone when he was at the GTG I recognized some of the voices around the table and heard new ones I did not know. I had Pete say hi to everyone for me after we got off the phone. I felt like I was the phone a friend for him.
751053,Gerritt,2012-12-11 19:05:00,6129, Now it makes sense lol
751062,Handlebarz,2012-12-11 19:27:00,3790,I guess I should make sure to wait to make my first post of the day. 4:52 bc (Before coffee) Was not at good choice. Next time it'll be 4:52ac Then everything might make some sense
751080,HTHM,2012-12-11 20:43:00,4082,"Those who WERE there have the best pics, memory pics...."
751109,Christopheraaron,2012-12-11 21:56:00,3525," Yup, it was great listening to your stories Albert!"

750373,fishindevil,2012-12-09 12:36:00,6254,"The problem is we are all spread all over and depending on where the g2g is sometimes its hard for people to come from long distances. !!! Almost need a north,east,west,south g2g contrary to popular belief Toronto is not the center if the universe. !!! Lol...."
750392,Christopheraaron,2012-12-09 13:50:00,3525,Lol! Wherever it is ill try to be there
750957,SirCranksalot,2012-12-11 04:14:00,3291,"Maybe the next 1 can be just North of TO, say Vaughan to Newmarket. Making it into the inner city(Anything Lawrence or below is a major PITA for those not used to it. The traffic---yi, yi, yi!"
750975,Handlebarz,2012-12-11 09:52:00,3790,It was nice to hear everyone again and the voices I did not know I guess in the way I was there Kinda only a friend style.

739232,irishfield,2012-10-24 16:55:00,26272,Doesn't fit the chemo schedule at this point.. but it might work if she decides the week following that she wants to be home in her apartment for the weekend. I've got the date marked.. we'll see what happens.

737544,Ron,2012-10-18 03:04:00,1683,"I would be willing to drive the 3 hours if it was on a weekend or a Friday night. I would end up making a weekend out of it by fishing the area too.  I met back then ""EH"" for the first time. You know, there are some things you regret in life... and that wasn't one of them. Can't forget the ""Jester"". Good times it was.  Cheers, Ron..."

737843,John,2012-10-19 00:22:00,2956,One more bump to the top looks like a December Fri or Sat is the way to go...
737876,fishnsled,2012-10-19 03:35:00,3520,A December date should be doable.
737916,mirogak,2012-10-19 12:44:00,387," Dang - this is in the GTA!  Mr. Borger, MJL and Spiel are in, count me in too...."

737955,Christopheraaron,2012-10-19 15:50:00,3525,Sounds good to me!
737966,bigbuck,2012-10-19 16:19:00,2449,"Its in my neck of the woods. Depending on how I feel, I will try to stop in for a wing or two."

738196,MJL,2012-10-20 15:59:00,2427,"Bring on the wings...Maybe some fish n' chips  I'll try to duck out of work early...Possibly to hit up a river on the way  No manager in their right mind would think someone with ""violent diarrhea"" is lying"
738200,i2cool2fool,2012-10-20 16:34:00,349,Hmmm. Maybe we should chat and possibly car pool part of the way. I am just easy of London and considering to join the party.

737319,Spiel,2012-10-17 16:30:00,9065, I'm sure I can swing it and because I'm without a vehicle I'll get the lovely Miss Julie to accompany me.
737323,John,2012-10-17 16:34:00,2956, Sounds like a plan...I will make sure that I don't have a vehicle either...
737329,John,2012-10-17 16:50:00,2956,"OK I guess I jumped the gun. They don't take reservations on 2 4 1 wing night, first come first seated. Any thoughts guys and gals?"

737410,Handlebarz,2012-10-17 21:27:00,3790,I'm also a weekend only person can't take time off work for it.
737430,John,2012-10-17 22:48:00,2956,Nothing magical about Tuesdays. To me the most important thing is to give as many as possible the opportunity to GTG. Lets give this a few days to see who else is in and we can go from there. Maybe a Friday night?
737447,irishfield,2012-10-17 23:11:00,26272,Pending date and time... you never know. Not a long haul from Jen's but it was the last time we did the firehall all the way from home!
737448,Handlebarz,2012-10-17 23:13:00,3790,I did the same Wayne drive up from Chatham met new friends talked with some I already knew and drove home it was a great night.
737452,MJL,2012-10-17 23:20:00,2427,"I'd be interested in a G2G. If it's in Oakville and on a weekend, I may be tempted to hit up a nearby river or two before and after the swill"

737481,Christopheraaron,2012-10-18 00:25:00,3525, I wonder why...
