750658,mike rousseau,2012-12-10 08:26:00,4661,I think I'm gunna give musky a shot this week before it closes....  I never really target musky this late in the season.... Usually all my energy this time of year goes into walleye fishing..... Now I KNOW a few spots that are holding musky.... I'm just not sure how to get em to bite this late in the year...  I've got under 40 degree water temps....  Now I know most say go big... But I've boated 10 nice musky in the last few weeks while trolling 3.5 inch baits for walleye.... So this is where I second guess what I've read....  Anyways...  I was thinking trolling 10-14 inch baits at around 2.5 mph....  And/or  Jig some plastics....  Are there any tips/tricks you guys feel like sharing....?  Thanks  Mike...
750663,lew,2012-12-10 09:36:00,12766,I'd hit those good spots Mike and start big & slow  and see what happens. You don't always need real big in cold water but it's a good starting point.  Change things up and see what pattern you come up with.  And if I hadn't left my Christmas shopping so darned late I'd come join you
750664,Handlebarz,2012-12-10 10:01:00,3790,Mike down here our Muskie love small baits all year long but this time of year once the water temperature is below 40Â° i change my program totally I only run 10 inch baits and speeds of 2 miles an hour to 2.8 mile hour max.  Don't be afraid to try jigging bulldogs or Bondy Baits they are awesome also I know fish still bite on small stuff like you said 3 1/2 inches but majority of the big fish will eat large slow-moving easy meals as they are only trying to fatten up at this time of year they will not waste a lot Of energy chasing down meal giver Hell there I can't wait for the reports good luck.
750685,Rizzo,2012-12-10 13:34:00,4754,"personally, when the water gets real cold I like to jig big plastics in deep water. Trolling/banging bottom is just too frustrating for me...I always second guess whether my lure is clean so I'm forever checking it. I jig with a big bait where the hooks are on top so no fouling issues. Plus, you can band bottom continually, stirring up a bit of a ruckus."
750690,Squid,2012-12-10 13:49:00,1656,Thursday is a NEW moon which is  a great time to be out fishing!! Looks like Thursday for me with Saturday sprinkled in for good measure
750775,mike rousseau,2012-12-10 18:45:00,4661,"I have the following to try jigging... Bondy bait... Bulldogs.... Tubes... Giant kalins.... And a fuzzy duzzit..... I was gunna lean on the bondy bait for jigging....  As far as trolling... Ill probably bounce between stalkers, believers and jakes and 13 inch grandmas.... Lures I trust and that have out performed in most situations.... I'm hoping to get 1 or 2 people to join me for the extra lines for finding the pattern....."
