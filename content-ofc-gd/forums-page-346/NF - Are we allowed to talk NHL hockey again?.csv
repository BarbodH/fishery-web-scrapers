750439,tb4me,2012-12-09 17:46:00,3295,"Ecklund polled 50 players..The results are somwhat suprising....Have a read here http://www.hockeybuzz.com/blog/Eklund/Polling-50-Players-on-NHLs-3-Demands-Take-Important-Survey-and-Be-Heard/1/47870     Eklund The Anonymous Hockey Blogger • RSS• Archive• CONTACT     I have talked to over 50 players.  1. 45 of them want a 10 year CBA. The realize CBAs only get worse for players in all sports each time you negotiate them. So every year you get between negotiations the players win.  2. 44 of them believe that while a 5 year term limit could potentially hurt the middle to lower guys they also agree that missing a season will ABSOLUTELY hurt those same players who will be replaced by two draft crops entering the NHL at once who will make half of what they make. Last time when we lost a full season over 100 players lost their jobs when it returned. a 5 year deal sure beats early retirement.  3. 47 of the 50 like transitional NHL systen which allows teams to have salaries which could reach 70M despite only paying out 50%. The players like this because without it teams would be required to dump salary and trade players, AND the summer UFA market over the next two years would be shot.  So these are the three issues Fehr is unwilling to accept and these are the three issues Fehr IS willing to throw away all the players December money for.  But don't worry. Some of the players are actually getting together and planning a way to make something happen. I do believe enough players at this point realize Fehr made a hell of deal in getting the 300 make whole and arbitration, UFA, Pension, etc.  The NHL took all that off the table, but I am told it would only take a new proposal with the players agreeing to these three issues as the NHL wants them (which is also how the players want them)  I was also tipped off this morning that Fehr himself may actually like the three issues as well but is holding out for 380M. He believes the owners will cave on that. I honestly don't know, but I really think in a shortened season paying players for games they didnt play with a fanbase that is pissed off in an economy less than 30 days in America from a financial cliff...It won't fly. The players hold the power now as shown by the owners willingness to do the make whole. The second the season is cancelled, going into next year, the owners will hold all the power.  Talking to some owners now, over the last few days, there is sort of odd calm to them. I really believe the owners feel the deal is done and they are amazed watching the players throw away the December checks.  How I see this playing out is simple  At some point...end of the month, before the owners cancel the season the owners will give the players another shot at Tuesday's deal. The Players will get one more chance at 300M and 10 years. All they will need to do is accept the 3 things. It will be a ""make it or take it"" deal, and some will cry the NHL is ""strong-arming"" the PA. But it will be the deal Fehr masterfully got them.  There is ZERO POINT ZERO ZERO chance the players throw away a year of their pro hockey life/ a hundred or so careers over the Three issues.  ZERO.  A season will happen. The owners are baffled that the players won't accept the three things now and get paid in December (and more at the end of the year because of another month of HRR) but the owners don't think the players will cancel the season over what is left.  Bottom line. The players can make a season happen and it is up to them as to when it starts. Anyone who says I am pro owner or wrong to put this all on the players remember this. I am saying Fehr has negotiated a MUCH better offer then I thought anyone could. The fact that the the owners are getting their 50/50 and honoring the signed contracts without taking away arbitration is absolutely a WIN for the players...and the longer you can ride this CBA...the players win every year longer because 50/50 will go up and up and up after year 3.  I don't know how many more times I can say the same thing and more to the point hockey fans, many of whom are struggling financially are really starting to lose touch with the players they once loved over it. The game is being damaged every day we wait. People are either pissed or what's worse just apathetic. And I can't blame them anymore...  This survey will be telling...I don't put it in here to be a jerk. I put it in here to honestly see where we are."
750441,tb4me,2012-12-09 17:47:00,3295,I think if the PA were to put it to a vote right now this is over and were back to watching hockey.. Interesting......
750444,kickingfrog,2012-12-09 17:54:00,8333,That fool has zero credibility.
750445,tb4me,2012-12-09 17:59:00,3295,Perhaps so..This is different..There is clearly a divide in the PA....
750447,kickingfrog,2012-12-09 18:05:00,8333,The PA has 700 odd members. Of course they are not going to agree on every individual issue. A ten year role playing vet has a different agenda then a second year potential star etc.
750450,tb4me,2012-12-09 18:15:00,3295,On thiurday night John Shannon (I belive it was anyway) reported on twitter that the PA agreed to the term at the table with the NHL. They went into meetings with the PA and Fehr told them (the PA) to hold out for more. Hence the disgust of Gary at his pressie...this will end this week..That im sure of.. Also as far as Ecklunds report 45 out of 50 are good to go..That number seems kinda staggering and has tipped the scales hugely in favour to getting back to the game..I think if the PA put forth a vote with Fehr this is over...Mind you this is just my opinion..
750451,tb4me,2012-12-09 18:21:00,3295,"Bob McKenzie‏@TSNBobMcKenzie  As fan protests go during the lockout, this one is exceptionally well done. These guys from the L.A. area are angry. http://vimeo.com/55149830"
750455,kickingfrog,2012-12-09 18:38:00,8333,It's hard to say if we are even discussing facts but agreeing to term does not mean agreeing to a deal. The term is only one small aspect of this negotiation.  Remember the 43% and 24% rollback offered in the summer?
750457,moxie,2012-12-09 18:39:00,1566,"NHL Hockey? What is that anyway?          Note: Its quite laughable to see and hear the value people put towards professional athletes these days. After all, they play games for Pete's sake!"
750459,jedimaster,2012-12-09 18:46:00,3472,"The only roadblock I see is the nhl owners unwillingness to negotiate back and fourth to find a middle ground. The nhl succeeds on the blood, sweat and skill of the players. I say put every club up for sale and bring in a fresh crop of owners.  I don't think there will be a deal done. But I hope one side or the other cracks and pronto. I don't care what side cracks as long as a deal gets done. I'll happily watch the world juniors but watching ahl is so boring."
750462,Whitespinnerbait,2012-12-09 18:57:00,2038,"Hopefully the owners never give in....let the players crawl back on their hands and knees begging for a deal of lesser value. I mean after all according to the players....All they want to do is Play Hockey !!!!!  If I hear a hockey player say All we want to do is play hockey one more time, I'll poke both my eyes out with a dull pencil."
750464,kickingfrog,2012-12-09 19:00:00,8333,What do the owners want?
750465,tb4me,2012-12-09 19:00:00,3295,"I agree with most above..Except the AHL the Marlies are exellent to watch..I also belive that this will settle this week. The owners and players are going to have to agree eventually..why toss the season aside.. In my opinion as we stand right now, the players hold all the cards, if this season is cancelled the owners have all the power..I also think that if the NHL cancelles this season they should fold up shop and start a new league without a greedy union.."
750470,Jigger,2012-12-09 19:23:00,1237,"I find all of this rather laughable. If the owners wouldve let the season begin under the rules of the old CBA and then the players went on strike as talks broke off, Id say the players were at fault. But seeing as the owners saw fit to not honour that part of the agreement, theres no question as to who is taking the blame.  My contract ends in May right as the the new 3yr contract begins. Union security is nice sometimes . I just dont see how this was not taken care of long in advance.  Edit: eklund lol"
750607,jedimaster,2012-12-10 01:41:00,3472,"Sure in 5 years of kicking out all of the players and recruiting all of the AHL teams, the NHL may recover talent wise. But for the next 5 years its going to be mediocre hockey full of players that aren't good enough to be in the NHL, only good enough by default. Only a very small percentage of the AHL players will ever see an NHL game for no reason other than they are not good enough. There is a reason Kadri isn't in the NHL yet and that's because he is NOT good enough. Not even good enough to make the Leafs. The Marlies are one of the better teams in the AHL and he is one of the better players on the Marlies... so what does that tell you. It tells me one of the better players on one of the best teams isn't good enough to play for one of the worst NHL teams.  I am not trying to pick a fight or pick on the AHL, its competative hockey, no doubt, and they play with heart. I am just pointing out that these guys just aren't the best of the best and that is what the NHL is. Thats what I want to see. The best of the best."
750608,jedimaster,2012-12-10 01:51:00,3472,"Case in point, just out of curiosity, I just went to ticketmaster, I can get a pair of Row EE platinum  seats in the section beside the corner(mid faceoff dot area I think).... Even without another competitive market that pair is only 86 bucks and available readily a week before puck drop. There is NO NHL right now, and people aren't even willing to pack the house with lower bowl tickets for a 10th of the price as the NHL, and 10 billion times the availability."
750626,tb4me,2012-12-10 02:59:00,3295,I agree 100% with this statement. You would be surprised on how many of those pros would break the ranks of the union to play almost right away let alone within one season..I'm sick of the employees dictating how much the business owners put in their pockets..Thats not how it works anymore...Not in the real world..Just ask the Teachers.....

The fact is the average Joe can't afford to take in a game with their kids because the ticket price is outrageous and the vendor prices are just as bad.

Because again and again they caved in to the outrageous salary demands of the players for far to long and have an unrealistic expectation of profit. throw in a couple ""dumb factors"" Like a players union with their heads in the clouds, agents whom make their living off exploiting the youth of the game under the illusion of protection from some crooked unholy alliance between both owners and Players unions....and of course then there is Bettman The only guy dumb enough to think Hockey needs to be expanded to be better?

750909,dhickey,2012-12-11 00:49:00,1038,Can't wait for the world junior tourny.  I agree . It is all about greed.  Pls correct me if Im wrong but didn't I just hear on the news last week that the hockey players got 10.000$ ?? (STIKE PAY??)  If that is so than that is an insult to every hockey fan.  I think its safe to say that most people would be thrilled to make 10.000$ over 3 months working every day never mind sitting on your duff trying to figure out what to do today.  The biggest problem players/owners and agents have is tying to figure out what golf course to play next week.  As a fan Ive had enough... Let them call off this year and next year.  Enuff of the spioled brats.  On a side note I have often thoght that if every hockey fan were to boycot watching any sport including every thing/ or gambling this would see the revenue of all sport related media suffer thus putting preasure on the advertisers as well as broacasters news meada in genneral causing a ripple effect.?  Dont forget WE are the customer/client not the players/owners or meadia...  Just a thought.
750916,dhickey,2012-12-11 01:30:00,1038, Hmm.  My sled will destroy your sled any day  As a secondary thought it might be time to find a leader that has extensive knolage of hockey not a bettman but a hockey person . Say for instance like a Pat Quinn? Thats what the NHL needs to lead it into the future. Im shure there must be several great hockey minds/buisnes men through out the northern climates.Not only within North Aerica but ovrseas as well? Please correct me if im wrong but Betman did well with baseball and basketball yet openly addmited that hockey will be a challange. When he took the job of commisioner?  He is failing.
751025,SirCranksalot,2012-12-11 18:04:00,3291,"I guess the NHL is like a lot of companies---intimate knowledge of how things work on the 'shop floor' is regarded as being unnecessary, or maybe even an impediment, in 'upper mgmt'! Call me cynical if you like. I don't mind."
749914,jedimaster,2012-12-07 16:29:00,3472,"i think the mear fact that there is a collective bargaining agreement means there is collective bargaining. If you want it so the Player's have no and aren't part of the collective bargaining process, then you need to bancrupt the NHL, and start over, have open tryouts and hire players as staff. Of course, then you have to determine does the NHL as a whole employ the players or do the teams? If its the NHL then the league would determine who is in and then there could be a draft for every team. If its the teams then unless there is some sort of agreement between all of the franchises then you would need to have some sort of agreement on what sort of caps they want to impose on salary etc... now of course when you have that many players and that much money involved there will eventually be a union formed between players in of all the teams. Then there will need to be a collective agreement and terms so that every player is treated the same between teams.  Then of course there are going to be poor teams that won't be able to compete with salaray so you will need to have some sort of max or minimum, perhaps a profit sharing or luxury tax between rich and poor teams. Or I guess you could just scrap the 10 crappy teams. There is no way to run a league the size of a pro sports league without some sort of collective agreement in place. Labour laws etc... all dictate that. It's just how the beast is. You want the best players, every team wants an edge to win, they WILL pay as much as they need to to try and get the best players. You need to keep it under control so you need contracts etc...  As it is right now. The league bargains with the players associate to come up with a CBA. Thats just how it works or breaks. Like it or not."

749956,jedimaster,2012-12-07 17:56:00,3472,"x2 NHL players take risks every time they lace up the skates, ask all the guys with concussions. People WANT to pay to see the BEST. Thats why they get paid so much. It has nothing to do with who the owner is. You could swap out all of the billionaire owners for millionaire owners, or groups of pension fund owners and people would still pay to see the BEST play hockey. Swap out the BEST players in the world for second rate players and people won't pay nearly as much... That what the AHL is. People aren't paying 500 dollars a ticket to see the AHL. Same reason why the CFL is not so popular. Some may like second rate talent, but the majority want to see the very best. CFL versus NFL Olympics versus Panama Games MLB versus AAA NHL vrs AHL NBA versus D league  People want to pay the big bucks to see the best talent. The little baby league's will have there strong supporter's and good for them, but why begrudge The Best  of Best, when any single one playing in the little leagues would sell there soul to the devil to be in the big leagues."
749960,kickingfrog,2012-12-07 18:11:00,8333,"Another argument (not necessarily brought up here) is that ticket prices are based on player costs. Gary said as much last time he locked-out the players.

You're getting millions of dollars! These guys make more in a year than most of us make in a lifetime. The owners took the risk of making a MAJOR investment. They should be allowed to make as much as they can, as long as they treat their employees fairly. I'd say millions is pretty fair."

749979,jedimaster,2012-12-07 19:13:00,3472,"All of the major leagues have had lockouts and strikes. NFL, MLB, NBA etc... This is a lockout, no different than the others. The owners make an offer and say its there best and want to negotiate The players counter that offer The owners reject it without reviewing it, they want a yes or no The players wait for a new offer The players counter The owners reject it without reviewing it, they want a yes or no The players wait for a new offer   Evenutally the Owners will have to actually start negotiating or they will need to cave and make an offer that the players will accept. Either way that will take a long time, because the owners show no sign of wanting to negotiate a deal, and the players are going to keep waiting for a good offer. I mean its not like the owners are actually willing to negotiate for real. If they were then this would have been signed sealed and delivered long ago."
749981,kickingfrog,2012-12-07 19:18:00,8333,  Financial risk? Just this week the billionaire owner of the wings waddled up to the government trough (citizens tax money) for a new arena.

Team owner (many are not individuals anymore but it keeps the typing easy) also owns the arena his team plays in and a parking lot next to the building.  The arena charges the team a rental fee to use the building, not only on game nights but practices as well.  The arena charges rent to the team for coach and management office space.  The parking lot profits all go to owner and are not reflected in the team's revenue even though the fees are double on game nights.  The owner takes in profits and a salary that he pays himself. And don't forget the salary counts against team's P and L statement.  The owner says ""My team barely broke even last season"". Better yet, ""we lost x amount of money"" 'cause that's a wright-off.

So far all I have heard from Bettman and the owners is here is our offer, take it or leave it, we will not entertain any counter offers, if you refuse our offer then the deal is off the table.  Right or wrong, Lockout vrs Strike, good deal or bad deal, that is no way to negotiate. I don't think anything is gonna happen until next year after the season is lost...

Best thing for Toronto hockey since 67   "" I want a bald eagle in the dressing room""  ""We're not giving you one""  "" Toronto said I could have a bald eagle, and they said he would have his own stall and everything""      The small market teams would go out of business , we would be back down to 20 teams.  So what like California needs 3 teams. And Vegas needs a team like I need a hole I'm my head,"
749843,BillM,2012-12-07 04:50:00,17367,"Screw the NHL, I'm looking forward to Dec 26th and the Juniors!!!!"
749854,bare foot wader,2012-12-07 05:26:00,1354, well that depends on the industry you work in and your position/relationship to the business processes  counter offers when giving notice are pretty common   I'm not missing the NHL this time around and personally support the players 100%  the juniors are going to be even more special this year
749858,glen,2012-12-07 08:24:00,2641,I forgot all about hockey. But since you bring it up is Bettman getting close to being fired. I hope the players start up there own league.

749876,jedimaster,2012-12-07 13:13:00,3472,"I have negotiated back fourth in many places. If an employer was negotiating with me and said here is the deal take it or leave it. I would leave it. That's not negotiating at all. And I agree, I just don't get why people try and compare pro sports to normal life. When the cbc comes to your work to put you on national tv doing your job and millions of people pay to watch you work then I would also support you in your negotiation for a contract."
749877,bushart,2012-12-07 13:17:00,2628,Contracts must be different for pro sports  An average working career goes for decades while a pro sports players shelf life is considerably smaller  Making Hay while the sun shines to the max
749891,ecmilley,2012-12-07 14:28:00,2163,good thing the fish don't go on strike
749892,Jds63,2012-12-07 14:44:00,1365,"still miles apart  http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/nhl/article/1298936--nhl-lockout-putting-on-a-show-rather-than-doing-a-deal-cox  Taken from above article... ___________________________________ So where are we actually? Closer to a deal? Well, close on some issues, and still a ways apart on others, difficult ones. The key issues appear to be limits on the length of contracts — the league wants five years, the players offered eight — and the term of any new collective bargaining agreement. The league wants a 10-year deal — most fans do, as well — while Fehr’s contention is anything longer than five or six is unreasonable. _______________________________________"
749897,jedimaster,2012-12-07 15:06:00,3472,"The players offered an 8 year CBA with an opt out at 6, the league offered 10 years with an opt out at 8. To me that is REALLLY close. The league should come back to the PA's offere with a 9 year with an opt out at 7. But they won't Bettman doesn't want to negotiate. We wants to write the deal up from start o finish take it or leave it. To me that sounds very unreasonable.  Think about it this way. You will work in your career for 30 or 40 years. The NHL its 6 years(well 5.6 but lets round up... If you were part of a negotiation process would you want to lock terms for 50 or 60 years? That seems unreasonable to me. How can anyone possibly predict where the NHL will be in 10 years. Will there be contraction, expansion, how many teams will be relocated or bancrupt in that time? It doesn't matter what the salary cap is or how long the deals are, some teams will never make money. To me it makes sense to match longest contract term with the term of the CBA.  9 year CBA with 6 year opt out,  6 year max contract with 9 year max if resigned as a ufa to the same team.  Those number fall in between what the NHL offered and what the PA offered. Thats what negotiating is, finding a middle ground that both parties can live with.  No different than one of us selling a fishing real.  What if I put an Ad up for a Shimano Stella that said  NIB Shimano Stella STL1000 FE 700 dollars willing to negotiate - OBO  You emailed me and said I'll give you 600  I emailed you back and said no its 700 take it now or I am going to pull my 700 off the table and raise the price to 750 dollars and I won't let you use it until next summer.  Chances are good you would tell me to piss off.  Now this is afishing thread so this should keep it alive for a while."
749901,blaque,2012-12-07 15:41:00,2419,"Weve created these monsters....no one but ourselves to blame.  Theres a bit of a disconnect from reality when you see this kinda stuff:   Heres his summer home: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMdEDt-B3O0  Totally ""unfair"" for a 17 goal scorer last year and 10 the year before."
749902,camillj,2012-12-07 15:42:00,1988,"OK ... I suggest we poll ALL the juniors (and the players)...NOT the UNION ... and ask them if they wanna play Hockey for a living ... get their shot at fame and fortune ... play for 5 years (with an option for another 5 if they perform) ... ask them if they could live on a million a year plus expenses (plus endorsements) .... first/best 1000 to sign up get in ... best 500 get to play ... other 500 play for 50% in the minors ... best 50 performers get 2 Million, next best 250 get 1.5 million ... lowest 10 percent get bumped down to the minors to give the next crop a chance ... stop screwing around and get on the ice ... or get to the back of the line - or go do something else for a living - so the other 1,000,000 hopefuls get their shot.  Let's face it .. the guys who finally 'make it' ARE getting THEIR dreams fulfilled ... and a very lucrative (if short) career ... they're not doing it for us or for the owners ... come on - these guys come and they go ... and we always take whoever comes along next (and have been for generations)  On the flip-side its up to the owners to figure out how to make that financially sustainable ... its NOT a partnership ... its not a negotiation ... and if some of the players have become THAT rich that they can afford to buy a team (or shares in a Team) and are prepared to take the RISK (by the way it would be interesting to ask the few players who have done so whether it was a such great investment) - ONLY THEN would they have the right to their share of the profits (or Losses) ... getting to play is an opportunity at fame and fortune for a very fortunate few... and I'll bet ya most would do it just for the fame if thats all there was on the table  IMHO it's time for everyone to get off their high-horse and get back to reality.  GO LEAFS !!!!! (or should I say .. COME BACK LEAFS !!!)"
749903,John,2012-12-07 15:46:00,2956,Quite frankly I'm happy with minor hockey and looking forward to world juniors. Other than that I really couldn't care less.
