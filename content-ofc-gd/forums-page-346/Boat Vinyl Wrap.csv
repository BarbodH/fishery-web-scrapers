Sometimes when I lift my trolling motor the propeller hits the boat.  I was thinking of putting a small piece of vinyl at that spot to prevent against nicks to the paint.  I live near Bass Pro Shops and my boat is near Lindsay, anyone know where I could get a piece of vinyl wrap.  Also, anyone use a keel guard and/or skeg guard?  I'd like to hear about your experiences with it.  I want to protect those areas as well as they are suseptible to bottom scrapes.  (I fish shallow alot)."
751292,lew,2012-12-12 16:38:00,12766," I've got a KeelGuard on my boat and it's excellent. I put my boat right on top of a truck sized rock on Nippissing last summer and not only did it protect my boat, there's not even a scuff on the guard.  I'd definetely recommend it to anyone with a glass boat that fishes in rocky areas."

This stuff is so durable that a stone will dent before it scratches the paint. Check with a local car/truck accessory shop or detail shop; they might have scraps available. Failing that, I could give you some 2"" wide strips to make what you need. PM me if you're interested."
