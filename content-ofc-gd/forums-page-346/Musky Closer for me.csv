751437,Ron,2012-12-13 00:36:00,1683,    LMAO......
751474,Squid,2012-12-13 02:22:00,1656,LOL
750707,Handlebarz,2012-12-10 15:06:00,3790,Rizzo I know it's rough out there this time of year with the top up that's why we just trolled. I like to call it hardcore pansy musky fishing. This was the first time I used the top in three seasons I do love it and would not buy another boat without it.  Thanks Mike good luck to you this week
750710,Squid,2012-12-10 15:12:00,1656,If it wasn't for the top and the nose cover we would have been swamped a few times as waves actually crashed over the bow!!
750713,SlowPoke,2012-12-10 15:27:00,2984,"I've run the bimini or full top almost every time out this year and I've logged almost 150 hours on the motor. It's a lot easier to stay cool than to get cool, likewise for warmth.  My new boat has so many top options that it's no longer a nuisance; - full open with top stored flat and out of the way (this required a $30 modification) - bimini - bimini + windshield extension - bimini + windshield extension + side windows - bimini + windshield extension + side windows + rear drop curtain - bimini + windshield extension + side windows + full camper back  It's probably not exaggerating to say that the top options have doubled my time on the water on several occasions. I considered getting a buddy heater but I don't think I need it now; although, Mike could wear his shorts. LOL  I'll be the pansy out there on Dec. 15th (unless I'm in New Brunswick again) and back at it in March for salmon. Who's coming?"
750719,asdve23rveavwa,2012-12-10 15:41:00,2690,"Awesome stuff, Mike!!!!  Way to close her out!"
750761,JoshS,2012-12-10 18:03:00,729,Nice to see a musky report. I was gonna get out there for one last shot last weekend but never did it. Good for you on getting out there!
750764,K_F,2012-12-10 18:04:00,107,"awesome report, looks like youve got the pattern dialed out there....thanks for posting this"
750771,Handlebarz,2012-12-10 18:29:00,3790,Pete I forgot about all those waves yes we did eat a few of them I love the front cover It sure keeps a majority of the water out of the boat.  Frankie thanks it was a great day with Pete.  Joshs thanks there is still time for the last kick at the can.  KF Thanks yes I did have a pattern figured out I am just glad the musky hold to the same program year after year it makes things easier when they cooperate.  Slowpoke if you're hinting that I need to change the title of this thread I can do that and start a new closer thread next Sunday. My only problem is I will  need a chauffeur pick up at my house Saturday morning My truck will be gone for a brake job
750801,Joey,2012-12-10 19:57:00,9122,"What a fun report, awesome Mike"
750811,Squid,2012-12-10 20:24:00,1656,I may be heading back down to Lake St.Clair on Thursday for the new moon.
750813,Handlebarz,2012-12-10 20:28:00,3790,I might be sick cough cough
750827,Squid,2012-12-10 21:11:00,1656,LOL Mike!!
750831,Handlebarz,2012-12-10 21:25:00,3790,Thanks Joey you know with Pete it's always fun
750833,SlowPoke,2012-12-10 21:30:00,2984," ""Musky Closer Pre-Fish"" If I'm going, picking you up is not a problem. Maybe I'll put in a cake order too!"
750838,Handlebarz,2012-12-10 21:38:00,3790,Sounds good to me but you know you have to place the order yourself do I don't mess it up heck it will be the last with her old oven as the new one comes Saturday when I'm out fishing.  How did my closer turn into maybe two more trips??? Not sure but I like it
750842,Squid,2012-12-10 21:42:00,1656,LOL
750896,irishfield,2012-12-10 23:51:00,26272,"Something about.. ""the older you get, the wiser you get""!"
750976,Handlebarz,2012-12-11 10:46:00,3790,Lol Wayne Now thats hardcore Nancy Muskie fishing

751234,Squid,2012-12-12 13:25:00,1656,Tomorrow is looking so gooood!!!
751242,Ron,2012-12-12 14:10:00,1683,"Nice to see you boyz ended with a bang Mike and Pete.  I failed to get out one last time since being down your way.  The weather just wasn't favorable on the weekends I could get out.  Still had a great season overall though.  Cheers, Ron.....  Pete, looking for a partner Thursday??? Nah just kidding, tough to make a one day trip on a weekend let alone on a weekday!"
751371,Handlebarz,2012-12-12 20:50:00,3790,Ron if you change your mind we will be at belle river dock at daybreak
751392,SlowPoke,2012-12-12 21:59:00,2984,"Daybreak? LOL Don't hold your breath!! Ron, you're welcome to join us and meet me in London"
751404,Handlebarz,2012-12-12 22:19:00,3790,Brian I was talking about tomorrow but yes Saturday is still a go heck depending on tomorrow I might need to take Friday off also.
751408,Ron,2012-12-12 22:27:00,1683,"In all the years I have loved my wife, this is the first time she has put her foot down. As Terri put it..... ""Your gonna send that whole web site into shock..... (cause Ronnie couldn't go).....""  Geesh, you think you know someone after being married to her for 24 yrs..... what a ""ahem"" sweetheart......  Not so cheerful, Ron..."
751417,Handlebarz,2012-12-12 23:28:00,3790,LOL that's what you get for ASKING first you would think after 24 years you would know better. Just think you could have been down here landing the third musky of the day before she knew you were missing and then when she did call you would not get the call as we all know cell phones don't work on the water.
750358,Handlebarz,2012-12-09 11:51:00,3790,"Yesterday I the chance to get back out on the water with Squid to close out the musky season we met at Subway after making the girl behind the counter blush and then laugh then wonder whats wrong with these two we headed off to Belle River. The weatherman was calling for light NE winds early then changing to N 14MPH then NW 18mph with gusts to 27mph and lots of rain scattered into the mix.  we decided to just troll with the top up on the boat (I know hard core pansy musky fishing) well that's what I call it LOL, I started off running the same program we do every year at this time and it paid off very fast as Pete netted the fist musky with in 10 min of starting out nothing huge but I had to take a picture for some one who will remain nameless that was supposed to come out fishing but lets say he was a ""slowpoke"" getting back from PQ so we had to make it known to him what he was missing.  sorry about the blurry pics I forgot my camera bag at home   Quick pic and it was off I fire off a text and get back from said member that we are cork soakers I guess he was watching Saturday night live at the time  Now we are running again not to long after the same rod goes off Pete does not want it he commented that he was happy catching what bites his line and I could get my own rods so I did quick fight and Pete does another great net job.  Here ya go Slowguy we take another pic for ya then text it away this time I am told ""Lose my phone number I can not put his last word here""   off we go again trolling along I have the same rod go off again but this time I loose the fish so I am nice and tell Slowdriver we lost another one well he thought that was just plain of ""GOOD"" Im not sure if he was happy for us or just having a nice day driving home from Belleville?  I could not answer that text as I was busy watching Pete net my third musky of the day and at 10:35 so I had to send another text    Im thinking that said Slowman was not happy with me as he sent me a picture of pouring rain and transports asking if I was jealous? not sure what his point was we had not traffic around us and the rain had stopped.  at 11:02 I sent him another text letting his know that we had a slow point of the morning as I just lost 2 and got this one   I can not put the last text from Slowsupertrucker but lets say he was very happy for us.  I had a awesome day out on the water 4 musky landed 3 got away but we saw them at the boat side all musky went home super fast and ready to eat and fatten up. It was great to have Pete out again but I think he jinxed us as he had said after the third musky I boated he will take my rod if I get 5 musky in the boat well 4 was the limit I guess as they were done.  The wind did as the weather man said it would and by noon all other boats left Pete and I were the only ones left fishing in the 1.5' waves with 2-3' footers mixed in we called it a day and maybe my season at 2:15 what a great year I will try and do a recap later.    See Brian it was to rough to be out there anyway you made the right choice by working"

750376,fishindevil,2012-12-09 13:08:00,6254,Great season closer guys !!!! Some quality fish for sure !!!! Great story too bad Mother trucker Brian would rather be in traffic driving in the rain !!!! Too funny..... Thanks for the laugh and great report mike
750377,SlowPoke,2012-12-09 13:11:00,2984,"Surrre, I take you to that spot last week and now Pete knows about it. I would have been there sooner but I had to keep pulling over to safely read and answer text messages. My boat isn't put away yet!"
750381,Rich Clemens,2012-12-09 13:15:00,3131,Great way to end the season Mike.
750382,Gregoire,2012-12-09 13:15:00,1397,Great report. Those are some really healthy looking fish.
750384,Gerritt,2012-12-09 13:23:00,6129,Very nice guys!
750386,Squid,2012-12-09 13:28:00,1656,It was an awesome day to be out Mike! Brian your lol secret is safe with me lol. Roy I was 0 for 0 yesterday lol like Mike stated I said I would take the 5th fish but Mike decided to long release a couple so he could keep his count under 5 hahahaha
750387,Roy,2012-12-09 13:34:00,13728, Good friends out fishing...that's the nuts and bolts of it all. Glad you had a good day.
750388,Squid,2012-12-09 13:41:00,1656,Oh yeah had a ton of fun at others folks expense at least the fishing wasn't as slow as poke.
750391,Squid,2012-12-09 13:48:00,1656,One more kick at the can for me next weekend on the upper. OFC used to do a G2G on the closer so if anyone wants to come out you are more than welcome.
750393,lew,2012-12-09 13:55:00,12766,"Good stuff Mike, some nice fish there !!"
750394,spincast,2012-12-09 13:55:00,3279,Great way to close out the season.   I'm pretty sure you turned one trucker green.
750413,Handlebarz,2012-12-09 14:51:00,3790,Roy your right I'm sure he was super happy for Pete and I.  Thanks Andrew this was by far my best closer.  Fishindevil I'm sure he had a good reason to work extra maybe he did not want to watch me catch em all first hand???  Brian I'm sorry to slow you down it was not my fault I blame the musky goddess. Hmmm your boat is still going are you free Saturday? Maybe my closer was not my closer.  Rich Dan and Gerritt Lew thanks guys  Pete you had better keep that spot a secret I know I will. It was a great day. Good luck next weekend.   Spincast I'm sure he was a bunch of colours and changed with each text.
750453,Whopper,2012-12-09 18:36:00,2174,Mike you might have had the top up but were you still wearing shorts? Good to hear you two got out and had a good day
750484,Handlebarz,2012-12-09 20:00:00,3790,Yes I did Phil but I cheated and had my summer gortex pants on to keep me dry. The temps were nice until that N wind kicked into high gear.  Phil it was nothing like you and I a few years ago in the pouring rain 40+ mph winds and then blizzard now that was a cold no shorts day
750493,linweir,2012-12-09 20:19:00,202,Thanx for sharing. This was a good outing.
750533,Leecher,2012-12-09 22:34:00,7832,Great way to end the season Mike    4 for 7 is frigging awesome in anyone's book
750539,irishfield,2012-12-09 22:44:00,26272,Mike... are you saying Peter got skunked again?  Glad you had a good day out... I've had the boat at the door for months now and it just never works into the plan around here.
750548,Rod Caster,2012-12-09 23:12:00,5784,Great report. I got a good laugh too
750574,Whopper,2012-12-10 00:29:00,2174,"I remember that day well, I also remember we were the last ones off the water that day while we watched a few of our group in fully enclosed tops wuss out Bad part about it I still had fun"
750600,Handlebarz,2012-12-10 01:27:00,3790,Linweir it was a great outing  Troutjunky it was dang awesome we had a blast  Wayne I'm not sayin I'm just sayin if ya know what I'm sayin now go get that door out of the way.  Rod caster it was twice as funny Saturday in reel time just as Brian.  Phil even with the flooded boat frozen hull death leap for the shore blown live well lines and no fish it was a great day. I must say I was shocked when the cabin cruiser left because it was to cold out lol I thought they had the heat on full tilt.
750616,Rizzo,2012-12-10 02:19:00,4754,"fantastic report...but fishing with the top up? C'mon! I was on Balsam about 2 weeks ago, whitecaps crashing the bow..me and my partner were literally coated with a cm or 2 of ice (as were all surfaces of the boat). We didn't catch as many as you guys, but I dare say our day might have been just as memorable! (having said that if I had a cover I would have used it   )"
750657,mike rousseau,2012-12-10 08:16:00,4661,Great closer......  I haven't targeted musky in almost 2 months.... I might have to give em another try before closer Saturday....
