751429,kickingfrog,2012-12-13 00:14:00,8333,Local tv news just had a bit on an American eel that has been netted in Simcoe. Rare but not unheard of and the numbers have been increasing. No catch or possession. MNR says that it is a good sign of improved water conditions and let the them know if you catch one.
751430,Christopheraaron,2012-12-13 00:16:00,3525,Good news!
751433,Acountdeleted,2012-12-13 00:21:00,2562,Facinating.
751436,MJL,2012-12-13 00:34:00,2427,"Very cool!  I never wouldâ€™ve thought American eels would make it to Lake Simcoe. From my understanding, all eels migrate from the Sargasso sea (in the Atlantic ocean where they were born). They would have to swim up the St. Lawrence and go past many dams before reaching Lake Ontario. Then migrate through the Trent Severn canal system (also past many dams) before finally making it to Lake Simcoe. There they live until they migrate back to the Sargasso sea to spawn (kind of like a reverse life cycle of a salmon and with a longer lifespan). Is this right?"
751440,kickingfrog,2012-12-13 00:47:00,8333, Yep. I think they said there was 41 dams/locks that they would have had to have passed to make into Simcoe.
751443,Christopheraaron,2012-12-13 00:55:00,3525,"It would be cool if we could fish them. I caught one once off shore while fishing for stripers in nova scotia once, great fighters!"
751447,danjang,2012-12-13 01:04:00,148,"There's been reports of American Eel in the Rideau canal system too. They also live very long. Given enough time, an eel can make it's way anywhere there is access. Getting back to spawn however...."
751457,big guy,2012-12-13 01:28:00,414,"The eel was probably released by someone into Simcoe, much more likely than getting there from the ocean"
751462,Muskieman,2012-12-13 01:38:00,2472,"We used to go to Ardock, On. for a few weeks during summer when I was a lad. (not sure where around Ardock, I was 8-9-10-11) and catch them at night with a BIG net , I think Dad ,uncles Angus and Howard drank too much sauce and used the badminton net from the camp... anyways , I remember running around with an Eel Belt tied around my camo pants.  They were cleaning them with pliers and scissors like we do with  'lil Brown Cats, we had a HUGE Eel fry, Clam Boil,Upsidedown Turtle, Frog Legs and Barbotte and Ecrevis ( I'm Scot/French we eat anything)"
751476,Slop,2012-12-13 02:27:00,151,"Like the Atlantic salmon, the American eel was able to complete it's cycle of life without barriers in many watersheds connected to the Great Lakes. Some lakes in the Ottawa area see the odd catch of the American eel...but the hub and concern for these eels is on the Ottawa River....doubt they've lost their way. <in the mind of an eel> Don't make your problem, my problem mang."
751507,irishfield,2012-12-13 04:19:00,26272,"We saw them in Smiths Falls, between the main lock and Old Slys in the 70's! I lived on the river there..."
751521,Muskieman,2012-12-13 12:11:00,2472,Ardock is near Smiths Falls / Perth right ?
751522,Rich,2012-12-13 12:13:00,3927,"Does anyone else remember catching them fairly regularly at cootes paradise, before the carp traps? I remember my dad catching at least five in my lifetime in the desjardins canal before they blocked off access."
751533,Fish4Eyes,2012-12-13 13:34:00,1022,About 15 years ago I caught an eel at Bronte and I still remember to this day the fight that thing gave me. All spectators figured it was a salmon judging by the fight.
751568,Dave Bailey,2012-12-13 15:21:00,1641,"Back in the 90s I saw a guy catch one in the Humber, at the site of the old marina off South Kingsway."
751594,SylvanOwner,2012-12-13 17:01:00,266,"MJL is bang on with the life cycle....interesting creatures for sure.  We used to electrofish quite a few during annual/seasonal sampling on the Toronto waterfront and I remember a buddy angling one as kid from the Bay of Quinte - hell of a fight.  I don't think we've seen one now in several years and it's quite well known that the population is in severe decline due to man-made barriers.  There is some effort underway to improve passibility of these obstacles, hope it's not to late.  This would be a very difficult specie to reintroduce given the ""reverse"" life-cycle (explained by MJL above).  How do you imprint/train young eels to migrate from the Sargasso Sea to the tributaries of the Ottawa River for example?"
751596,NAW,2012-12-13 17:03:00,4022,"Crazy  Are they edible? ( realize there is no possession limit, just curious)"
751602,DoubleDigits,2012-12-13 17:19:00,140," Indeed they are! I would describe them as having the texture of California Condor, the underlying bamboo flavor of Giant Panda, combined with the unmistakable finish of rare Lake Ontario steelhead."
751603,Raf,2012-12-13 17:21:00,3495, They are ideal for the smoker (fatty).  Smoked eel is delicious and a delicacy in many places.  We used to fish for them in the Bay of Quinte (back when they were numerous - propably mid-late 80s).  Hope they make a rebound.
751604,captpierre,2012-12-13 17:28:00,2521,I think there was a significant commercial fishery for them in Lake O way back.
751610,fishindevil,2012-12-13 17:58:00,6254,"they are lifting them over the dams on the st lawrence river,and yes they are native species,but the barriers have decimated thier numbers,and they are now protected i believe,you cannot poses them at all,they are now listed as endagered"
