751703,limeyangler,2012-12-14 01:12:00,5204," Thanks man, will be getting out at least once this weekend.....cant wait.   Thanks DB!    Not long now Nick    I feel your pain...the last 2 weeks have been torture!    Thanks Ernie, cant wait to try it in deeper snow. I heard ya about learning how to adjust the articulating suspension...seems a bit fiddly...but after today it felt set up pretty good as is....no pushing in cornering....pretty much turn on a dime....such a huge difference from my skegless old XLT!   Come on up....would be a blast. jack did a little happy dance round the living room when i asked if he wanted to go for a ride.    Thanks Brian....whats wrong with my outerwear? Speedos are still in fashion right?  Long time left breaking her in....but she is gonna fly....the torque on this thing is phenomenal!    Thanks Joey......we have some good sleds eh?    Awww....Rick....i never knew you felt that way about me.    Thanks TJ....I got something in the mail that I will be trying out this weekend when i get out....more pics to follow.    "
