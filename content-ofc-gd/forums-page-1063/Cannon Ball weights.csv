176146,natemr2,2008-03-25 16:07:00,21,"The sharks do work great but be careful on which you buy, there was a bad batch of them that had an air bubble in the casting, which resulted in them not tracking straight, when running dipsies whith the bad ones you were gauranteed a big mess. They have since taken care of the problem but there are alot of bad ones still out there, have a look at the ridge back rattlers we have had good results with these as well. As far as weight goes 10's seem to be what most guys run, but it all depends on the guage of fiberglass your boat is, make sure you use some sort of backing plate if you are deck mounting them.  Nate"

176155,2 tone z71,2008-03-25 16:23:00,1311,thats nice work man is that your swirl
175456,2 tone z71,2008-03-24 03:17:00,1311,"so I got a set of Mag 10 HS just itching to go ,whats the normal most common size rigger ball thats used any favorites in perticular,what else will I need got the rods/reels/tackle"
175462,discophish,2008-03-24 03:30:00,392,"I just bought a pair of new mag 10's, and I still have to pick up the balls and 6"" pedastals (man are they expensive!) , and retreivers.  I will be running 8 pound balls.  I was thinking of using bricks to save some money, but hey, I have already went this far"
175465,2 tone z71,2008-03-24 03:37:00,1311," I was gonna surface mount mine ,whats the reason for the risers and whats the retreiver for grabbing the ball ??? they look to be like great riggers,8lbs sounds good  what are they worth"
175472,discophish,2008-03-24 03:52:00,392,"I have a feeling that with my luck, when I reach to retrieve the weight/line from the water, I will end up swimming.  And knowing whom I'm with, they probably won't swing around to pick me up.  So the retrievers will prevent from taking that unexpected swim, and perhaps save a bad back if you have one.  I need to lift the units up so that the rods have enough clearance in the holders where I'm mounting them, and at the same time to save my back.  I know it's only 6 inches, but I believe it will make a big difference.  I can flush mount them as they are and they will clear the gunnels ... but I want them lifted.  From what I see, balls are anywhere from 20 to 60 bucks more or less, depending on the design."
175474,2 tone z71,2008-03-24 03:56:00,1311,"cool I like that idea I may have to look into them,thanks"
175475,2 tone z71,2008-03-24 03:58:00,1311,"Disco Phish how are ya planning on wiring them,are you gonna conceal the wire and use quick connects or just rough it"
175488,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-24 05:58:00,835,"""I have a feeling that with my luck, when I reach to retrieve the weight/line from the water, I will end up swimming.

In the days of sailing ships sailors wore  gold rings so that it would be worth stopping the boat and coming back for them if they went over the side. Maybe you should invest in some jewelry."
175494,silveradosheriff,2008-03-24 10:03:00,1025,DP - you may consider running a bar across the back. It provides a combination of practicality and safety....   
175730,discophish,2008-03-24 21:35:00,392," It would be ideal to connect them short to a panel so that they can be taken out easily.  You wouldn't want to run the wires under surfaces where it will be too much of an inconvenience to disconnect if you want them portable.  Eventually, I would aslo like to loop the switch at the dash and have control of them at 2 locations.  I haven't looked into that yet.   Interesting to know, I have actually never heard of that.  That's a wise insurance policy to invest in.  Hope the sailors didn't wear too much that it them sink faster than they could be saved.  Too ironic!   Excellent suggestion SS.  I was thinking about that and wish I could, but the boat we have is already small enough (16 foot Princecraft).  I thought about the idea when Irishfield was explaining his progress on his mounts.  Unfortunately we would need a bigger boat, because we are having a hard enough time making our space resourceful as it is.  Great job on yours!  What do you think about this Z71?"
175733,Spiel,2008-03-24 21:45:00,9065,....I've used a number of cannon ball styles over the years and I'm partial to anything not round. I picked up a pair of these in black (10lb) last fall and but have yet to try them. I've no doubt they'll do the job. I wouldn't hesitate to go 10lb or even 12lb as I find 8lb to be just a little light.
175736,fishindevil,2008-03-24 21:50:00,6254,"Well 8lb are not too bad if you are not running deep,i use 10-12lb,thats the most common weights,for salmon & bows on lake ontario,8lb balls will track to far back,when trolled deep,and wont give you a true dept,also the io & 12 will almost be sraight down,making it possible to see on some graphs,mine pick them up just perfect,so thats something to consider too,as well as what you have your riggers mounted too,you dont want 15lb balls on a 2 inch thick transom,it will pull your boat apart,so theres some things to check for sure !!!!"
175751,2 tone z71,2008-03-24 22:22:00,1311,"im gonna mount mine on the flat pads on each side of the transom I can get my hand in there so maybe hopefully ill be able to thru bolt them,then on each side im gonna run a 12 V disconnect for each rigger and neat up the wiring,I think after reading the last few posts ill stick with a 8-10 lbs ball dont wanna rip the back of my boat off lol  "
175877,silveradosheriff,2008-03-25 01:12:00,1025,"I hear you DP - but that set-up is on my 16'7""."
175905,icefisherman,2008-03-25 01:38:00,952,"I too got pair of new Mag 10 HS recently and just mounted them on my Lund yesterday. Boy do they look nice.....pictures to come shorlty when finish all installations....  I've been using 10 Lbs so far but am planning to switch to 12 Lbs for the new season to minimize the drag. By the way Mag 10'S are rated for up to 20 Lbs. so plenty of room to move up.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
175933,fishdawg,2008-03-25 02:09:00,912,"10 lbs are good use 12 is your running a temp probe to minamize the blow back   when possible & practible, try to mount all the down riggers & rod holders on the corners & the side gunnels - try to leave the back wide open to allow plenty of room to net fish"
175944,2 tone z71,2008-03-25 02:34:00,1311,thanks fellas all cannon ball @ mounting info appreciated
175999,POLLIWOGG,2008-03-25 05:11:00,835,when you bolt them on try to get a plywood or metal plate backer on the inside.  I wouldn't go under 10lb and keep them  the same so they track together in turns.
176019,Billy Bob,2008-03-25 11:24:00,5865,"Don't use anything less than 10 lb balls.  The stress is really nothing on the boat however, when I first mounted my Cannon down-riggers 23 years ago I was also concerned but I have no problems after all these years. Again go 10 lbs minimum.  BTW use SWIVEL MOUNTS.  This makes it very easy to rig as the ball can be swiveled into the boat. This is really important on rough days."
176073,2 tone z71,2008-03-25 13:25:00,1311, thanks they came with the swivel mount that will work great
176077,Landlocked,2008-03-25 13:34:00,171,Just bought a few of these in plain black on the recommendation of many hardcore big water trollers: http://www.sharkcannonballs.com/
176080,2 tone z71,2008-03-25 13:44:00,1311,"those are nice how much they ding ya for shipping ,I hate UPS"
176089,Landlocked,2008-03-25 13:56:00,171,"Actually picked them up locally at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock.  Don't be discouraged by the prices shown on that site, I paid quite a bit less but for the life of me can't remember how much since it wasn't the only purchase"
176121,Billy Bob,2008-03-25 15:10:00,5865, VERY nice. I like the looks and shape but $75 - $79 each is way more than I would ever pay for a cannon ball. I got my cannon balls for less than $20 each.
176122,Uncle Buck,2008-03-25 15:15:00,1000,"Cannonball weights depend on depth typically  up to 60ft deep 8lb up to 100ft deep 10lb 100+ ft deep 12+lb  the heavier the cannon ball, the less blowback you'll recieve also need to go heavier if you're running a down speed probe...  as for rigger boards/risers... i can custom make them for you if you'd like...  i've done a bunch for people...  samples of my work:                  "
176127,fishindevil,2008-03-25 15:26:00,6254,"Yes those sharks are expensive,but they work just as good as an attractor too !!!!   man those salmon key right in on those sharks big time,sometimes they will even strike the shark we have seen it on camera !!!! they are worth their money for sure !!!"
