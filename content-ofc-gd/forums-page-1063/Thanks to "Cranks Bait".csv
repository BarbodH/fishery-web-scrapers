176454,irishfield,2008-03-26 01:21:00,26272,"Just wanted to publicly thank Scott for going out of his way... buying sale items on spec at CTC and offering them to OFC members at cost LESS his delivery expenses. I don't think Scott even ice fishes... but he went out and bought an ice shelter and an ice auger just in case someone here wanted them and couldn't locate in stock items in their area. Heck he even drove to Prescott, from Brockville, to shop for them!  Scott went out of his way and delivered a 2 man ice shelter.... down into a dead end farm road out on the Carleton Place hwy...to my mothers/step-fathers ON EASTER SUNDAY ! I picked it up last night after coming out of Ottawa and brought it home today.  It's guys like Scott that make OFC a great place to hang out and participate in.  Thanks Scott !  Wayne"
176458,Joey,2008-03-26 01:25:00,9122,"Wow, that is fantastic.  Kudos to you Scott.  You went above and beyond.  That's why OFC is such a great place, people like you.  Joey"
176460,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-26 01:30:00,1351,yup. Scott aka cranksbait is a fine gentleman! He helped me pick up a float suit last year at his local surplus store and mailed it out to me at cost only..  Much appreciated Scott!!   kevin
176487,GbayGiant,2008-03-26 02:00:00,1780,"Lot's of good guys on here, amazing Scott. It's one of the only sites I know of that you can actually trust someone you don't even know and never met before. Wayne's one of those guys too, that's why it came back too you."
176494,Mike the Pike,2008-03-26 02:05:00,3421,Wow
176497,Bly,2008-03-26 02:06:00,1556,:thumbsup_anim:  WTG Scott!   Now everyone is going to know that you are a nice guy!
176502,douG,2008-03-26 02:09:00,2693,"I hate this miserable crap.  What is the point of doing something like that, anyway?"
176504,ccmtcanada,2008-03-26 02:10:00,7971,Cranks is a great guy!  I bought a float suit off him at a great price...he shipped it FAST and for free.  When I opened the package I noticed a few nice cycling touques in there that he just gave us...we use them all the time.  Would fish with this guy in an instant!!
176509,irishfield,2008-03-26 02:14:00,26272,I should add.... he didn't even have my money yet ! Someone gave him the impression I was good for it... wait till that puppy bounces! LOL

176587,huntervasili,2008-03-26 04:17:00,1604,"WTG Scott, from the little that I have spoken to him he seemed like a 1st class sorta guy, Way to be there buddy!"
176629,Whopper,2008-03-26 11:21:00,2174,"Kudos to Cranks!  Wayne sounds like something you would do, glad to see ya on the receiving end this time"
176633,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-26 11:44:00,2585,"right on, very cool of him to do!  Cheers!"

176636,OhioFisherman,2008-03-26 11:50:00,6623,Nice job! Always nice to see people helping out any way they can.
176652,Stoty,2008-03-26 12:49:00,2910,"Agreed, a big thanks in advance to him for picking up an auger for me when my local stores (which are a complete joke), gave me the run-around on them!  Cheers to Scott!  *Stoty"
176653,cranks bait,2008-03-26 12:51:00,721,"You're all making me blush here.    I'm just glad I could help out.  Wayne's right I did go out of town to get this stuff, but it's not like I was really going out of my way.  Had to see if there was anything I wanted, which there was.  I just happened to notice this stuff, so I grabbed it.   And no I don't ice fish, even though I live right on the water?  Now don't go getting any idea's that I'm a nice guy, I've got an image to preserve  Again, glad I could help out.  Now I just wish I lived closer to everyone to get out with them.  Guess I'll have to hog the Larry all to meself"
176660,Reef Runner,2008-03-26 13:10:00,981,Good on ya Scott.  People like yourself keep this community above the rest for sure.  reefrunner
176669,wuchikubo,2008-03-26 13:25:00,1114,":clapping:  WTG Scott, truly an act of pure goodness! And definitely Wayne on the receiving end has a very similar character as well as a bunch of others on this board.  Thus the reason this is the main board I check out when I do get on to see what's happening around the fishing community."
176710,shane,2008-03-26 14:32:00,652,"WTG Scott!  And thanks Irishfield too.  I like to hear positive, upbeat stuff like this in the morning."
