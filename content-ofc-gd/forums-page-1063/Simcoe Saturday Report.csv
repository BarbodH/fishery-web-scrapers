176075,Headhunter,2008-03-25 13:26:00,5703,"Got out on Saturday with FishnSLed and my buddy Tom for some Perch action. Walking out from Keswick, we were stunned by the lack of fellow Perch hunters as we made our way out onto the ice. We were, what looked like, the only guys fishing that area for at least a little while, but it never got busy all day. Tom quickly drilled 15 holes and we stared jiggin. Me with a blue and silver Jiggin Rap and Tom with a Fire Tiger Rap and FnS with a jiggin spoon. Well folks, it was a 5 inch perch fest! Tons of little ones and barely a scant few, maybe ten ""keepers"" with one monster, caught by me. Not that we are competitive or anything, but when the size just isn't there, it's a numbers game for bragging rights! Tally for a full days perchin; Tom - 97 Headhunter 75 FnS 35! Tons 'o ice out there on Saturday and I can't help but believe that it was making more over the weekend. We did walk out, but felt a little silly walkin as there was plenty of ice for my truck! 22 inches is what we figured. Shore melt was non-existant and the wind chill was -19 on Saturday morning. All in all a great sunny day and lots of laughs, especially at FnS's expense... it's a technique Will... you'll get it! HH"

176128,Joey,2008-03-25 15:28:00,9122,"Jeeez, I wish we'd have gone now.  Sounds like you guys had alot of fun.  Great report.  Joey"
176134,Headhunter,2008-03-25 15:39:00,5703,"Actually Joey, it was a lot of fun! I just can't seem to get enough of Perchin! Truth be told, we found it to be a bit of a slow day out there. Our usual numbers are much higher than that and the 5 inch fest we encountered was becoming an area of frustration. Still tons o ice on the bay and by the looks of the long range forecast, many weeks to go! HH"
176161,Mike Pike,2008-03-25 16:30:00,1332,"Did you head out from Glenwood's Avenue, Headhunter?  Just curious, because I find the perch in the bay run kinda small, unless you're able to get into the deeper water.  Sounds like a great day, though, and some good fun!"
176186,Headhunter,2008-03-25 17:10:00,5703,"We walked out from the ""Pump House"" and started fishin in about 25 feet, moved deeper as the day went on and ended up in about 30 ft. HH"
176300,fishnsled,2008-03-25 20:26:00,3520,"Great to get out with you and Tom as always HH.  I don't know what I was doing different but that stretch of getting nothing for about an hour and a half killed my numbers.  Oh well, next time."
176332,MuddyWater,2008-03-25 21:21:00,218,go deep it seems the bigger ones have been in the depths this year. over 30ft even 60 is where the big guys are i havnt been out in a few weeks so they might be moving shallower
