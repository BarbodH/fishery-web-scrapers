176219,TJQ,2008-03-25 18:14:00,7806,Roy... I have got to get you here for a weekend.  I got lots of floors to ya!
176256,Whopper,2008-03-25 19:13:00,2174,Well done Roy!
176341,supergeorge,2008-03-25 21:48:00,4,looks great roy... Like the muskie baits
176505,Mike the Pike,2008-03-26 02:11:00,3421,Nice job neighbor does the wife make you mop the floor on your hands and knees too  squeeky clean.  Oh the advantages of smurfism  
176510,ccmtcanada,2008-03-26 02:14:00,7971,"Very nice work Roy!  And bly wasn't kidding...when are you getting here? LOL.  Our floors need done too, and I'm afraid I'm going to have to do it.....haha."
175906,Roy,2008-03-25 01:39:00,13728,"Well, I too had a long weekend this weekend but I could not get out of the house. I had to move furniture out of the den (up a few stairs). Then sand the floor. I tell you, wood dust does not hold a candle to freshair. Then did four coats of urethane.Then painted and installed new wood trim. Then the wonderful job of putting everything back in place without scratching the floor. One piece is 500lbs empty....down two steps onto the new floor. It's bad enough just moving it around on old floors. But, once I'd donned my Wilie Coyote hat and sat at the drawing board, I was able to calculate angles of departure, leverages and whatnot. OH, and being the techno wizard that I am, was able to re-connect all the video/adio stuff in less that an hour this morning. (Now THAT alone was worth a beer.) I know it's a terrible pic but it's the only one I took today.    The only saving grace for me this weekend that was at least fishing related was that between coats of urethane, I was able to get a little work in on some muskie baits.    I would have gladly traded places with any of you guys on the tribs or anywhere else fishing this weekend. And it certainly wasn't as glamorous as Bernie's beauty ceiling job....."
175910,Joey,2008-03-25 01:42:00,9122,"What a super job Roy.  Excellent workmanship.  Oh ya, the floor looks good too  Joey"
175911,Bly,2008-03-25 01:42:00,1556,Looks Beautiful Roy......and the baits also!   Since you are now a pro at the flooring...when can I expect to see you at my place??
175916,danbouck,2008-03-25 01:46:00,4380,"That floor looks great, nice job!"
175917,danc,2008-03-25 01:46:00,4677,"Looks really awesome Roy. There's a lot of pride when you do a job like that by yourself. Makes it all so much more worthwhile. Oh, and nice tv too!"
175918,bowshep,2008-03-25 01:47:00,378,Nice Job Roy... looks great  Ken
175922,tjsa,2008-03-25 01:49:00,1578,"I knew i liked linoleom for some reason! Now I know what reason. I could not walk on that floor, for whatever reason, in whatever footwear."
175923,Casey123,2008-03-25 01:50:00,461,"Beauty Job, Baits look like they are all ready for another season.  The floor looks great too....  I guess this is classified as fishing lure porn, with serious wood?  "
175925,Bernie,2008-03-25 01:51:00,3190,"Very nice Roy. I broke out in a sweat just thinking about sanding the floor. You did surprise me though, didn't think you could lift 500 lbs."
175927,Sinker,2008-03-25 01:53:00,8692,"Geeze Roy, you did all that over the weekend......you need a week off now!! I know first hand how much work that is!!! I did the same thing here......took me longer than a weekend......but I had almost the whole main floor to do.....what a job. I thought we'd never get rid of the dust!!  Nice work!! The floor looks great!! Any before pics?  Nice lures too......beauties!  Now take a break.....holy...your making me tired!!  Sinker"
175937,Roy,2008-03-25 02:14:00,13728,Thanks folks. You're very kind.   Bernie I can't lift 500lbs. Got J to do it.
175939,Greencoachdog,2008-03-25 02:20:00,8163,"Man that floor looks good!!!  Is the urethane ""gastric juice proof"" for when one of the Tadpoles hurls up grape juice on it???  I'm glad no Mucksies read this board, or they'd be jumpin at the monitor tryin' to eat those baits!!!"
175942,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-25 02:31:00,1183,"Really very pretty floor...have never seen that colour before....you know, I would have come....would have massaged your back, a few good pounds to get that dust out of yer lungs....I would have even painted the baits...remember...all kidding aside...You did fantastic work Roy....you missed out on bacon splashes but then again one can only handle so much pain...haha...bisous."
175943,TennesseeGuy,2008-03-25 02:32:00,957,Well done.  The work of an artist.
175946,Nanook,2008-03-25 02:42:00,565," Nice job on the floor Roy, the lures look pretty good too!  Taking a rest from painting pictures??"
175949,solopaddler,2008-03-25 02:49:00,8605,"Nice job Roy looks excellent! (and I can relate). I just finished refinishing the hardwood on the entire main floor of my house (living room, dining room and hallway). Finally got the furniture back in place on Saturday.  Not a fun thing when your kitchen and back deck is piled high with furniture for over a week and there's an unhappy wife and 2 young kids in the mix.. I sanded mine down to the bare wood as well then rubbed in 4 separate coats of stain then applied 3 coats of oil based urethane. Looks mint, but with drying/curing time it took a while. How did you manage to do it in one long weekend? LOL!"
175952,bpsbassman,2008-03-25 02:51:00,941,Great job Roy! How did you get rid of all the dust before putting the Urethane down?
175954,solopaddler,2008-03-25 02:55:00,8605," Educated guess here, but vaccum first from ceiling to floor then wipe the floor down with a rag dampened with mineral spirits. (Then do it a 2nd and 3rd time just to be sure  )"
175955,Roy,2008-03-25 02:58:00,13728,I actually was able to get all the sanding done Thursday night and into the wee hours. Was able to start the coats friday morning after  vacuuming everything and damp mopping the walls/ceiling/fireplace etc...No dust. Or very little.  Ha! You're quicker than I am Mike.
176084,highdrifter,2008-03-25 13:46:00,2534,Nice work Roy!  4 coats of urethane outta keep that floor perty for years to come..  And you can practice your moon walk in your wool socks!!  Nice baits too..  Desert in lieu of dinner.  Here's to you getting out there soon budday.  merde! HD
176092,BillM,2008-03-25 14:03:00,17367,"Roy,  Completely offtopic question:  What type of clearcoat do you use on the lures once you've applied the paint?  (I've got some beat up Suicks that I'm going to play with before the season)  BTW, floors look awesome, as do the baits!!!"
176098,Roy,2008-03-25 14:17:00,13728,Thanks Bill. There are all kinds of topcoats you can use for baits. A lot of the pros use 2-ton epoxy. I use either 2 part crystal resin or Vitra-Laque. The guys at tackleunderground.com are very helpful and there's a ton of info on there.  Good luck.
176191,Reef Runner,2008-03-25 17:24:00,981,"Nice baits...  Some great craftsmanship on the floors ther Roy.  I know what you mean about the sawdust, once worked in a door factory on the cutting floor.  My boogers turned to paste, great for paper mache though....  reefrunner"
176195,Gerritt,2008-03-25 17:33:00,6129,Nice job Roy!! Pickled Maple?  G
176213,Moosebunk,2008-03-25 17:59:00,3970,"Great report Roy, you really slayed 'em all this weekend. lol.  Chores that is."
