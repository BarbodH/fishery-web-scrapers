Remember that all service stations have their storage tanks buried below ground. The colder the ground the more dense the gasoline, when it gets warmer gasoline expands, so buying in the afternoon or in the evening....your gallon is not exactly a gallon.   In the petroleum business, the specific gravity and the temperature of the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, ethanol and other petroleum products plays an important role.  A 1-degree rise in temperature is a big deal for this business. But the service stations do not have temperature compensation at the pumps.  When you're filling up do not squeeze the trigger of the nozzle to a fast mode. If you look you will see that the trigger has three (3)stages: low, middle, and high. In slow mode you should be pumping on low speed, thereby minimizing the vapors that are created while you are pumping. All hoses at the pump have a vapor return. If you are pumping on the fast rate, some other liquid that goes to your tank becomes vapor. Those vapors are being sucked up and back into the underground storage tank so you're getting less worth for your money.  One of the most important tips is to fill up when your gas tank is HALF FULL or HALF EMPTY. The reason for this is, the more gas you have in your tank the less air occupying its empty space. Gasoline evaporates faster than you can imagine. Gasoline storage tanks have an internal floating roof. This roof serves as zero clearance between the gas and the atmosphere, so it minimizes the evaporation.  Another reminder, if there is a gasoline truck pumping into the storage tanks when you stop to buy gas, DO NOT fill up--most likely the gasoline is being stirred up as the gas is being delivered, and you might pick up some of the dirt that normally settles on the bottom. Hope this will help you get the most value for your money."

175994,holdfast,2008-03-25 04:38:00,1813,I did hear that Canadians gas is measured at temperatures lower than the States.  So.... Our Litre is really less than a litre.  Another Gouge for the Companies
176672,Tootsie II,2008-03-26 13:30:00,162,"If you read the fine print on the pumps, there's usually a sticker that says what temperature the pumps are calibrated for. This means that at colder temperatures the pumps give you a little less than what's showing on the gauge to allow for that expansion. It's suposed to give us a little more in very warm weather. Yah, right and maybe I believe in the tooth fairy too! IMHO it's another way for the gas companies to sc**w the little guy."

176760,charlied,2008-03-26 15:34:00,584,well I started pumping my gas slower when I got this email about a month ago...and I get about an extra 50 kilometres to a tank now in my truck....so I say there is truth in this
176814,Ramble,2008-03-26 16:43:00,713,"i'm going devils advocate on this one.  Charlied...how do you know you're not just filling your tank up to a higher level by going slowly? Sometime maybe you should try filling it up from a 1/4 tank slow and see how many liters you put in it, then the next time fill it up fast and see how many liters you put in it.  As far as poring it slowly goes.....wont a volume of fluid being poured out a small hole have more surface area then a large hole? As well wont the gas in the tank have a larger surface area longer? Both would increase the amount evaporated if surface area is increased.  How much temperature fluxuation do you think occurs in those tanks?? Even in the winter the frost line is only a few feet, the ground is an excellent insulator...Who remembers root cellars??? Not to mention the length of time it would take to change the temperature of a liquid of these volumes   You want to save money on gas buy a hybrid. I'm pretty sure there is a bit a of a tax break on them...  -R-"
