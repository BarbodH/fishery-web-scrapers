176353,TJQ,2008-03-25 22:07:00,7806, Three very true statements...
176356,Guest lundboy,2008-03-25 22:12:00,0,"There are also ""unwritten rules"" that are not specified.  These usually end up having your thread locked or having the post/thread deleted entirely without explanation, like it never existed.  You will usually see this when it is something political (which there is not any written-defined rule against)."
176370,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-25 22:30:00,1183,"  And there's also one's personal decision to have a thread pulled..such as I have done many a time.       Just ""blame it on the rain"""
176381,camillj,2008-03-25 22:49:00,1988,Fish crisp vs poached ... Musky ... even if its 'legal'  left hand vs right hand retrieve  cast vs troll   All very legitimate grounds for discussion
176386,TJQ,2008-03-25 22:54:00,7806," Often a political thread or something that just doesnt ""sit well"" with one fo the mods will get tossed.... this is true.  Usually if one of the mods is concerned the thread is getting distasteful, it will be locked and or pulled..  Ive done it a few times when someone or something was getting bashed, and it was enough....   no hard rules for those....."
176388,lookinforwalleye,2008-03-25 22:55:00,4399,"imagine that mentioning a lake or river on a fishing site! Oh the shame.  There are a lot of touchy issues some justified some not so much so, but the biggie is mentioning a fishing spot."

176393,TJQ,2008-03-25 23:06:00,7806,Ya... lol.. those are the ones the mods love!!  Subject:  Why did my obnoxious and spammy thread get pulled?? I want my money back!

We have had family and friends have great successes, great heart aches, live through pain and live through the support of the OFC.  As with anything in life, you can watch and learn the environment which you live.  Understand what get's punished and what doesn't.  Sometimes you will find that the good old boys network will prevail, praise be to the good old boys!!!  You will get upset because your post gets pulled but Big Cliff posts the same thing in two days and it is met with great reception.  Such is life.  If you feel you need to defend, rather than explain your position on a certain subject you may consider whether or not it belongs on a fishing forum.  I don't defend topics in life as I tend to get emotional in defense.  If I can't respond in an explanatory or enlightened way then I don't do it.  In life and here.  Enjoy it kids.  It won't be around forever and if it gets abused it will be gone before you know it.  No spell check, grammar check, OFC RULE check or other checks have been performed on this post.

176196,livinisfishin,2008-03-25 17:36:00,661,Hey Guys Since i have been on here (a whole month and a half) I have asked quite a few questions and got quite a few great responses! Over this time through posts and pm's i have been told that i shouldnt ask certain questions. Well now is the time where i want to know what is acceptable and what is not. My last topic was about the coldwater river and i was sent a pm saying i should watch what i ask because then fishing spots i ask about have the potential to be overrun by people who have otherwise never thought of going to a spot like that until they read about it. The pm was just a word of advice it was not a threat to me or anything like that ( i just want to clarify this). I wuold now like to hear where people stand on topics such as this and others on this forum. Thanks Again.
176199,Gerritt,2008-03-25 17:41:00,6129,"Jason,  Great subject!  There are rules and they are located in the Rules section...  Everything else is fair game within moral standards.. that being said everyone's morals are different and if you do receive a PM such as the one you did, you were either being given advice (from someone else's moral standpoint), or they had their own agenda in mind.  If you follow the set rules of this forum, your right as rain.  G"
176201,TJQ,2008-03-25 17:45:00,7806,"Rules are here...  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?act=boardrules  one of them is:  Please do not post VERY SPECIFIC information on fishing spots, ie pinpoint locations and maps. It is our belief that sharing this type of knowledge to the general public is not at all good for the resource itself. When communicating info on spots, please keep it to email or a PM."
176202,Raf,2008-03-25 17:48:00,3495,"we encourage discussion of tiller vs console, dill and gaffs, separate off-topic forum, oos fish pics, etc."
176203,Gerritt,2008-03-25 17:49:00,6129,   Hahahahahahaha!
176204,livinisfishin,2008-03-25 17:49:00,661," i was just going to post that very rule.  Key words "" very specific "" so asking what kind of fish species are in a river is not that specific?? Also on one of my first posts abuot spots to fish from shore, I had to make it clear that i was not asking for specific locations i was asking about whta kind of land marks or spots to look out for say while driving around...that cuold be anywhere in the world i was looking to fish. I can get very specific but i also respect my own spots enough to respect everyone elses. I would not purposely give out information on somebody elses spots because i know i would not want mine to be overrun with people. I am not trying to offend people here by any means."

176208,Moosebunk,2008-03-25 17:55:00,3970,"Very popular topics are  Leafs and Sens,  and,  Leafs and Sens fans.   Vertical muskie holds and several pictures of the same bow go over really well too.  Keeping trophy fish for the wall.  Gill netting and spearing always get   too.  We should have one thread started today to discuss them all at once.  Civil-like of course."

176320,Big Cliff,2008-03-25 20:56:00,6899,"I post specific spots and even GPS Lat/long lots of times. I even posted the coordinates for spot right out in front of my house once and watched for a couple of weeks to see how mant people fished there, None! (could be no one believed me) But if you really want to know my secret holes you have to come fishing with me and unless I know you well and trust you, you will never know all my best ones or what I was using. Actually, If I don't trust you, you won't be going fishing with me anyway.  If someone asks me for help and I think it might infinge on someone elses enjoyment or if it is a spot someone has taken me in confidance then I don't violate that confidance. If I feel that I can help someone and they have shown a willingness to help others then I often supply the information via PM or email. I have been fortunat enough to be able to help a few people here over the years and have received just as much if not more help in return.  I guess about the only rule I worry about is to ""do unto others"". Seems to work for me anyway."
176321,CLofchik,2008-03-25 20:58:00,854,"I caught a fish, it may or may not be trout......could be a salmon, i'm not telling.  There might have been more landed, possibly even more hooked, but I'm not saying.  It could have caught in a Lake Ontario tributary, possibly not, but definitely in Ontario.  Anyway thanks to the community for letting me share my fishing trip, tips up!  "
