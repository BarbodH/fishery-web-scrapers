176409,Rustic-Fisher,2008-03-25 23:38:00,826,"Headed home from night shift and decided to kill a few hours searching for some bows, their in there but between snapped off fish and sloppy hook sets I was able to go 0/4. Thats terrible, back out in the AM to make up for it. Did snap a few pics of some deer and a robin though. RF   "
176417,Roy,2008-03-25 23:59:00,13728,Nice RF. Thanks for posting. Maybe the next time you should blank out the deer in case one of the pinboys recognise them.  I hope you know I'm kidding.

176535,kemper,2008-03-26 02:34:00,2232,I recognise that deer.  He hangs out under the third brand of the white tree just past the bridge underneath smith street at  john river.  Kidding.  Nice pics! good luck in the morning!
176538,Bly,2008-03-26 02:36:00,1556,Cool pictures RS....you'll get into the fish next time!    Roy.....you're killing me!  LOL
