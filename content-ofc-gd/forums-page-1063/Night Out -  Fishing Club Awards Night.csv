176154,Gerritt,2008-03-25 16:23:00,6129,Pikehunter will you be there?  G
176157,pikehunter,2008-03-25 16:25:00,1659,"Just edited the above Gerritt. If I do get there I will be leaving rather early, how late would it run?"
176160,Gerritt,2008-03-25 16:29:00,6129,They can run late... but would still be worth your while to drop by for an hour or two..   G
176174,Roy,2008-03-25 16:53:00,13728,Have a good time out there tonight guys. We're expecting a pictorial essay. HINT: Pics should probably be taken early in the evening.
176179,pikehunter,2008-03-25 17:02:00,1659,"Gerritt, It would be nice to meet everyone, and the entertainment sounds great too!  Be a shame to miss it, however my meeting is actually a job interview. Actually it sounds like a gang fight as there is 3 of them against me, one of those panel type interviews and one of the interviewers is coming from out of town to see me! Wow, put the pressure on or what?   So if I decide to stay home and study up on my presentation I hope that FF, Spiel and you understand why.  H."
176688,Gerritt,2008-03-26 14:03:00,6129,"Well I had a blast, Had a few pops, blew some $$ on prize tickets etc... and listened to Italo tell me how good Rapala Taildancers are  I drug Bill Parker along with me who seemed to enjoy himself as well... shot the carp with Spiel for a good portion of the night, and I won a Rod and Reel! (unknowingly until this morning LOL)  and it appears I was sitting beside Sonny all night... did not have a clue it was you sorry bud.  Anyways all in all it was a blast and I am already looking forward to the upcoming meetings.  G"
