176099,douG,2008-03-25 14:18:00,2693,"Who gave away the secret location?  Ahh yes, now I remember, it was the dood who complained about posting too much information.  There must be other issues at play here, because that just doesn't make any sense to me.  Keep those reports coming, Kemper.  Goodonya."
176108,mattyk,2008-03-25 14:40:00,2110,thanks for sharing!
176156,ricoboxing,2008-03-25 16:24:00,398,"yesterday was a day off for a lot of people, which explains the crowds."
176166,jdmls,2008-03-25 16:40:00,575," Nice one bud, you must feel like Chuck Norris after that comment !!......you know there is a whole board dedicated to winers and cry babies like yourself.....FLOATFISHING.NET....go hang there for the spring !!!"

176266,kemper,2008-03-25 19:24:00,2232,"Honestly?  Can we get a mod to delete the post that nater made with the river name?  Your a joke, take a long walk off a short pier."
176273,huntervasili,2008-03-25 19:32:00,1604,"Good report Kemper... Thanks for sharing, sorry for your jealousy Nater, loving the contributions you always have   Glad I have someone to look up to    Ohh and Kemper... that log sticking out of the water over your left shoulder gives away the spot  and I think I have seen that colour water better change that up too... I look forward to the east trib reports and that includes you man, keep up the good work and get some more fish!"
176282,Roy,2008-03-25 19:45:00,13728,I'm busy right now looking after some important little people. I'll be back later to look after the children here.
175783,kemper,2008-03-24 23:41:00,2232,"Got out on the river for an hour today around dinner time...saw a few OFNers including Bly   and Cliff. Heard that cliff was being outfished as usual...  Only had an hour but I managed to land one and miss three despite the big crowds...it was like opener out there today. I hit a little spot I know that will produce the odd fish but gets overlooked by everyone on the river, the only reason that I even know its there is because Ive walked the entire river many times in the summer with my friends when I was little. Picked this guy up on roe, missed two more on jigs.    Not bad for an hours work, I wish I hadnt missed the other two though. This hole im speaking of has a very strange current and the bottom of the water column flows much faster than the top, it seems to cause missed fish because by the time the float goes down, the fish has had a few seconds to figure out theres a hook involved.  anyways, it was a good day."
175834,kemper,2008-03-25 00:28:00,2232,"Also, Who was the OFNer I met under the bridge today?  I forgot to ask for a name."
175871,GNODDY,2008-03-25 01:05:00,163,"Hey Kemper,  I forgot to ask you who you were too LoL names Geoff. I am sure I will bump into you again. I went home and had a bite to eat came back down with the float rod and managed 2 but no camera as my buddy who wanted to come left the cam in the Van.  Cheers  Geoff"
175882,kemper,2008-03-25 01:18:00,2232,"I was thinking about going down after dinner, But i had to drop my sister off at soccer instead. lol that was a blast!  Im sure we will run into each other again, Ill be on the river Wednesday afternoon and Dawn till dusk thursday its a short week at school!"
175895,Bly,2008-03-25 01:34:00,1556,Nice to see you again Kemper and nice looking fish!   That pool always frustrates me!   Hope the girlfriend isn't too mad  lol     Take care
175903,kemper,2008-03-25 01:37:00,2232,"Shes fine!  Actually, she will be joining me for an outing on wednesday! Ive explained that she cannot utter the words ""Im tired"" ""Im bored"" or ""take me home"" unless she wishes to take a swim in the drink. The very very cold drink.  She seems excited, we will see how it goes."
175908,Bly,2008-03-25 01:39:00,1556,"That is great...I hope you 2 are able to get into some fish and that no ""bad"" words are mentioned"
175912,kemper,2008-03-25 01:42:00,2232,Im going to be out on wednesday and thursday if you and Cliff are looking for someone to drift with!
175914,Bly,2008-03-25 01:44:00,1556,Thanks!   Will shoot you a PM if it looks like we can get out either of those days..
175964,solopaddler,2008-03-25 03:16:00,8605,"Nice fish, man does that water look mint  ."
175971,jdmls,2008-03-25 03:22:00,575,nice fish...wish I was that close to a Trib...I am stuck waiting around for crowd filled weekends !!
175976,Nater,2008-03-25 03:27:00,68,"Wonder why there were so many people, couldnt have anything to do with all these reports?    whatever good job on the fish.  I opted to avoid the crowd today and ended up hammering them.  Nate  if you don't want 6000 people out try and keep things quiet...tons of lurkers read these posts, see the reports and that's the extra push they need to go out and you end up with crowded rivers.  Simple as that."
175978,jdmls,2008-03-25 03:36:00,575," Hence the fact that no locations are revealed and pictures are edited for the benefit of the resources   ...without these posts I would have nothing to do at work !!! Keep em coming, LOL"
175980,iceguy,2008-03-25 03:45:00,341,So I guess a video report I made would fill up all the rivers out east?
175982,Toronto_Angler,2008-03-25 03:52:00,698, The nerve of people trying to enjoy a day of fishing.
175984,ehg,2008-03-25 04:00:00,2666,"Nice fish and report. Its pretty cool running into other OFNers while out fishing.  I was lucky enough to spend about 12 yrs. living very close to that creek.  Nice going,  ehg   I think there were so many people due to it being sunny and Easter long weekend. No big deal."
175985,kemper,2008-03-25 04:04:00,2232,"I guess we should all stop posting reports...because nobody will fish then right?  Give me a break, Im gonna keep posting my reports because I know people enjoy reading them, just as I enjoy reading posts from others. You will NEVER see me give away a location, nor post a picture with anything obvious in the background. If you can recognise the river from that picture then congratulations you are superman.  Take off.  Hosers.   Thanks for the kudos and conversation to everyone else!  tightlines!  (good humoured bob and doug joke..if you dont get it..well then take off)"
176004,PALEFACE,2008-03-25 06:53:00,10,"Kemper, it's...  ""well then take off eh, hoser"""
176005,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-25 07:48:00,1183,Nice fish - the girlfriend is just preparing ya for the little ones
176029,Cory,2008-03-25 11:48:00,170, At the time of this posting there have been 416 reads on this post....half of them are from TJ trying to figure out why somebody was at his camp.  Wouldn't call that tons.  I'd hate to see what would happen if somebody posted a Cooks Bay perch report.  The lake would be full of people.
176039,pigeonfisher,2008-03-25 12:14:00,696,You are always such a positive contributor Nate!  Keep up the good work!
176061,Toronto_Angler,2008-03-25 12:49:00,698, That's because no one wants to fish near you.  Hope this helps.
176087,Headhunter,2008-03-25 13:50:00,5703,"Good report Kemper! Don't let one little person stop you from posting... I just hope that all those folks lookin for some fish don't read my Cooks Bay report... awe, never mind... I didn't take any pics so they won't know which part of the bay to fish to find my ""hot spot""! Nater, if you don't like it, don't look, don't log in and post your opinions.. we all know them... enough already! HH"
176093,bowshep,2008-03-25 14:11:00,378,Look right now everyone will be out their... and when opener happens there will be more... you cant do anything about it... get into the flow and do the float dance... yes some times the line gets tangled... but get over it... its not intentional... and its funny how you see the people that complain about the crowds  fishing in the same places that l do... so many people and not enough shore line... catch and release and we will have fish for tomorrow.  Ken
176097,largemouth,2008-03-25 14:17:00,112,"hey i know that spot, I didn't know it held such fine fish though. Thanks for the heads-up, I will get a few buddies together and try it. I will post a detailed report when I return."
