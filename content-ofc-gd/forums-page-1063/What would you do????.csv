175934,Sinker,2008-03-25 02:11:00,8692,"Jigger, from this board, showed me a trick he uses, and I though it was pretty cool.  He puts that stick on velcro on the bottom of his camera.......it sticks perfectly to the carpet on the bow of his boat......hit the timer.....grab the fish and presto....your in business.  I kinda stole his idea, but I put a piece of velcro on the bow of my boat, where the trolling motor is......and my camera sticks on there great. Its hard to get it off.........but its the perfect hight for a standing shot....  You still have to take the time to set up your shot before you get a fish on, but it works pretty good, and no room lost to the tripod....  Sinker"
175991,maybe,2008-03-25 04:28:00,307," It's a good thought, but it doesn't work out in practice.  Cameras record video at much smaller image size than they do still images, and there's not enough image detail to print (unless you like tile mosaics).  Using my own 10mp cam as an example, a normal snapshot is 3264 x 2448 pixels (dots).  Decent prints up to the 16x20"" range.  Very nice 8x10""s.  The highest resolution video my cam handles is 640x480, which is the wallpaper on the computer you owned in 1996.  It's slightly more than half the width/height of standard screen resolution today.  Grainy prints at 4x6"" in an emergency.  Smaller cams are more likely to shoot video at 320x240, which is more like a grainy hockey card.  If you'd like to try printing these image sizes, here are some sample files:  1)  a 320x240 burro from ray3d.com  2)  a 640x480 field from Jordan's farm  3)  a 3264x2448 gateway from Worldisround"
176110,shane,2008-03-25 14:41:00,652,Thanks for explaining that TangledLines.  I learned something new today already.
176124,maybe,2008-03-25 15:20:00,307,You're welcome!
176132,Moosebunk,2008-03-25 15:32:00,3970,"Plenty trial and error will help with set-ups.  I fish tonnes of time alone, don't carry a tripod as it's cumbersome to move around in a canoe that I fish out of bow to stern when alone.  Afterawhile though you'll know where you can place a camera without zoom and where you should be in the boat to make it all work out.  Try it without fish a few times first.  If there's a flat surface in the boat that you know will provide you with a good angle for photos with catch try placing there and work with it.  As far as the big muskie goes... if you're not set-up you likely be too slow.  If you know how to set-up quick as you've practiced keeping things handy then, I'd suggest removing the lure, giving the fish a little to breathe while setting the timer, then, quickly hoisting the fish for the shot.  I've done this with pike a few times but, with practice and a fish that co-operates with hook removal you can usually have the fish in the boat for under 30 seconds and have everything accomplished.  To summarize, PRACTICE and work out photo scenarios ahead of time, then you'll be ready quickly and efficiently."
176140,wallyboss,2008-03-25 15:56:00,1095,"Justin you just told us your secret!!!!!!   One livewell, one fish,  lots of different change of clothes. No wonder you catch a lot of nice fish!  !!!!  hehehe  Joking!!!"
176142,JustinHoffman,2008-03-25 15:58:00,482,"Ha ha! Dan - I must of been into the bottle last night - no way should that secret of made it's way out!  Good Fishing,  Justin"
176171,BillM,2008-03-25 16:48:00,17367,"Luckily for me I rarely fish alone.  I dunno what I would have done in that situation..  Most likely land the fish, put her in the bottom of the boat, snap a pic and let her go...   Or leave her in the net and see if I could take a pic of her in the water...  She would be let go either way, no reason to keep a monster like that..  Even if it was a world record, I'd dunno if I could ever get rid of the guilt  I'd feel if I killed her."
176346,wjw,2008-03-25 21:55:00,35,"Another thought is video.  In recent years I have fished Canada alone during my spring trip. In order to get some pictures of fish, I have a video camera secured to the back bench.  When I hook a decent fish I will hit the record button and describe the action. The running camera makes for a quick release.  With the side view finders you can tell if you are ""off camera"". Even if your out of view, the audio keeps the video interesting.  If the weather is rough I will put the camera away while moving.  I always enjoy watching the videos during the winter."
176424,Lungelarry,2008-03-26 00:15:00,294,"So where is everybody putting this 55 to 58in. 50 lbs. muskie while they are setting up their tripod? Just holding it with one hand in the water and getting your gear ready with the other? Putting it in the live well..not to many guys have that big of a live well. Maybe tied to the boat with a big rope, maybe? Really I,ve been there and its way to hard to take a pic by yourself, let it go and only you know."
176427,JustinHoffman,2008-03-26 00:23:00,482,"Larry - don't you musky hunters carry nets/holding pens that are large enough to hold water buffalo?? I'm pretty certain that could contain your prized fish while you get things in order...No? Like I stated, the camera and tripod is already set and ready to go. Simple push of the button and you're done...  Good Fishing, Justin"
176434,Lungelarry,2008-03-26 00:34:00,294,"No net for me.... reverse gaff and boca grip. I,m not saying it can,t be done, but most times you catch the biggies is in nasty weather and usually your fishing for one  fish a day, so having the camera out all day isn,t realistic(rain ,wind). Murphy's law seem to work extra when your muskie fishing"
175835,LeXXington,2008-03-25 00:28:00,1928,"Great world of digital, Prior we took the picture then hoped it worked when we got it developed  ahhh the old days.  I am going to try the tripod this year prior it was set up like Lew has but if the fish was big I was pratically standing on the motor to get all of me in it.  Take the wife, now how she going to take the picture with her head over the side?"
175880,shane,2008-03-25 01:16:00,652,"  What if?  Instead of using the timer, and hoping you were in position when it went off, you set your camera to 'video mode' and get a quick 30 seconds or so clip lifting the fish up, hold it for a bit, and then back int he water. And then you could probably 'capture' a frame and make a picture from that."
175883,danc,2008-03-25 01:19:00,4677,"There's some really great self photos and advice here guys. Congrats.  One thing that I haven't seen mentioned here is the importance of focusing your shot. I'm sure that the guys that posted photos on this thread are aware of, and using proper focusing methods, but for those of you that attempt this in the future, here's a little more advice. You can use manual focus and have the focus pre set for the distance that you will be in front of the camera for the shot. Or you can use auto focus, in which case you must do a half press on your shutter button on your camera to achieve focus. But be sure that the lens is aiming at something that is the same distance away from the camera as you will be when you jump in front for the shot. I see a tripod in the back of a boat that could possibly be pointed to the horizon, which will result in a blurry shot once you jump 5 feet in front of the camera if using auto focus. If you're going to be 5 feet from the camera when the shutter activates, you'll want the camera aimed at something 5 feet from it when you do your half press. Once you half press, you can move the camera to any position and as long as you hold down the half press, focus will remain locked. From there you can continue on to your full press to start the timer. Simple as that. Just a little something that I thought was overlooked here."
175892,JustinHoffman,2008-03-25 01:32:00,482,"Good advice, Dan....something that I forgot to mention. No point using a tripod if all of the shots come out blurry...  Another tidbit is to use fill-in flash on all of your shots. Brightens up the shadows and makes the fish much more vibrant and colourful..  Good Fishing, Justin"
175893,Radnine,2008-03-25 01:33:00,1538," Not only are these fish awesome, and the pictures fantastic, but the little organizer on the seat is very cool and you might be the best dressed bass fisherman I have ever seen. Great post."
175897,danc,2008-03-25 01:35:00,4677, And yet more good advice Justin. Thanks..
175915,JustinHoffman,2008-03-25 01:45:00,482,"Thanks for the compliments, Radnine...  The little organizer I picked up about a dozen years ago. I believe it was made by Fish Formula, and holds three bottles of scent, files, pliers, etc. Excellent tool to keep things organized at the front of the boat.  As far as being ""the best dressed bass fisherman"", well,.....I do my best. ha ha I do photography for fishing magazines, so looking half decent on the water has become second nature to me...I actually bring various clothes and hats out on the boat with me, just to add variety to my stock photography stuff...  Good Fishing, guys..  Justin"
175924,Greencoachdog,2008-03-25 01:50:00,8163,"A pic and then a helluva fish fry!!!  Seriously though, my front pedestal seat is my tripod. All of my pics are by myself with the self timer function on the camera. It can be a challenge sometimes with the larger fish, but when you get used to doing it... it's not that bad.  Personally, I would make the decision after the hooks were out and the fish was ready to release... can the fish stand a pic or 2... or is we gonna have us a fish fry???"
