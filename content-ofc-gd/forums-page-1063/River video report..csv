176115,iceguy,2008-03-25 14:54:00,341,"Haven't been river fishing in years so I took Steelhedrmatt on his offer to lend me a 12ft rod(not use to a rod that long and not attaching it to a down rigger) and give it a go. I got the big skunk out there but Matt and his friend Nick caught some nice fish so I thought at least I better catch some fish on camera.

176285,steelhedrmatt,2008-03-25 19:49:00,278,"  I guess I shouldn't tell ya that I was exactly 381.5 steps from my truck. Right beside the third red rock from the fourth willow tree, on top of the bump in the trail then.  It's no secret river.  It's spring!!! the fish are everywhere right now.  If it's a flowing river in S. Ont. it'll have fish.  Go have fun everyone!!! And remember, C&R!!"

176448,Milty,2008-03-26 01:01:00,121,"that was awesome,..thanks for sharing,..as for the local,..I was thinkin it was a spot I knew on the notty,..just goes to show you trees are trees,..and very well put,...everywhere in southern O that holds steel is holding steel,..why some guys get there knickers in a knot over backgrounds is beyond me...if you know enough of how to catch these fish and what the background looks like,...you will know where to go and when,..backgrounds or not,..quite simple I think."
