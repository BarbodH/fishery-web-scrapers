177064,FinS,2008-03-26 22:37:00,463,i find its more challenging to land a fish without a net most of the time i dont use a net and when i do is mostly shore fishing off of breakwalls where i can only get the fish in by a net
176869,maybe,2008-03-26 17:47:00,307,"Now that's a useful tip.  Adding a can of Great Stuff to the shopping list.  Thank you!  I'd really like to hear more about the new flat-bottom coated nets vs cradles.  Space is a big factor for us.  We have a bowrider, and by the time you get 2 adults in there with boat bags, multiple big tackle boxes, and a claw anchor on the floor, yadda yadda, you're hoping nothing else bulky needs to come along.  We've got one of those Crappy Tire folding Rapala nets, mainly because it knocks down to a 3x18"" or so bundle that can hide in the boat's nooks & crannies instead of being hauled to/from the marina every day.  It doesn't get much use.  The more I learn, the less happy I am about putting a fish near uncoated mesh and sock-shaped nets.  A full-size net is really bulky when you're used to a folding toy.  Cradles collapse down small enough to hide on the boat, which makes them attractive - if they're actually useful.  If they're just going to give me a Rapala nose ring when Jeff catches a fish, maybe we'd better learn to live with a bulky net.  Input, anyone?"

176896,Milty,2008-03-26 18:07:00,121,"when steelheading on the rivers,..anglers only use nets until they are experienced/skilled enough to not use them or need them,..if the fish is close enough to net,..it is close enough to tail,..,..goes hand in hand with experience and skill, the more inexperienced the angler,..the longer you will have to play that fish, using a net saves no time at all,..also the type of net makes a huge difference,...there is also no need to beach a fish,..it seems to be implied that a fish will thrash around more if its not in a net on the beach,..well the argument was you can bring it in faster so it will have more energy, ..wouldnt that then imply that the fish will thrash more on those rocks and mud that you innevibly have to set it down on to untangle the mesh from all the thrashing,...its not overly difficult to tail a steelhead and remove the hook with your foreceps (although there are always exceptions,..big water like the niagara being one), keeping it in the water,...if you need a net, use a rubber one,...again talking exclusively about steelheading on the rivers here!!!"
176929,BillM,2008-03-26 18:57:00,17367,Can someone explain to me why the salmon net my oldman and I have used for the past 15 years isn't any good?
176965,richyb,2008-03-26 19:40:00,774,hey milty  if you are just talking about steels in the river about netting being bad .... does that mean that you have no problem with netting lets say a pike ?  ... Are steelhead anglers a different type of angler than others? ....  You catch a fish reel it in and release it .... no different than a bass fisherman or any other species .... I agree that slime comes off and the fins can get split apart from the net .  I personaly hardly ever use a net but if your not comfortable grabbing a fish then by all means use one...   I also disagree that its a skill to hand land a fish ..I have seen a couple first time ( unskilled ) anglers hand land a fish without thinking twice.  its all personal preferance.
177021,Clampet,2008-03-26 21:09:00,1947," Lest we fergit..  Forget the net, grab the gaff!"
177034,irishfield,2008-03-26 21:31:00,26272,"Oh and thanks Glen... this is the way it should be done.  If someone's got a great ""solution"" to a perceived problem start your own thread... don't going ruining someone's perfectly good post."
177037,fishnsled,2008-03-26 21:36:00,3520, I'll second that.
177063,aplumma,2008-03-26 22:27:00,6896,I am a big fan of nets I carry the net that will land the fish that I am fishing for according to the size of the expected fish. I have a med large net that is made of rubber that  works well for fish under 20 lbs. I also have a big frabil that I use when I come up north for the bigger fish that I hope to catch that day. I also fish for big catfish from a 28ft  boat and it is very difficult to use a net due to the railing and the height from the water. I have been using a boca lip gaff to hoist them from the water. The mouth of the catfish and the jaw structure are very friendly to this device and I have released many large fish without damage. I don't feel that this is a good answer for fish like pike and muskie or fish with teeth since their jaws are weaker and you have a chance of damaging their teeth with it. I have seen more fish damaged from a gill hold for the camera than the abuse of a net so if you do want the picture please don't slip your hand in the gill plate it is a slow killer even when done carefully.
