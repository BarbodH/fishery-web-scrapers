170319,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-03-12 14:10:00,160,"Hi Guys,  I’ve been swimming around this board since last month and might have posed or asked questions without the proper introductions, I apologize…  So here it is… My name is Anton and I am 31 years old. I am from Scarborough, Ontario. I work for Novopharm (pharmaceutical) and I LOVE fishing!!! I try my best to get out and fish under any conditions regardless of season  (ie: I was out on Cooks Bay last Saturday during the massive storm, had a great day with jumbo Perch, biggest being 1.6 lbs). The reason I joined this board is to gain good knowledge about the sport and to make some good friendships.  I have been checking out other boards as well, but I think when it comes to pure knowledge and experience, this board ROCKS, I’ve noticed there are several serious / heavy weight fishing guys here, so I decided to stay   Anyways.. I am glad I am here, and if anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask.  Cheers,  Anton Aka: BrownFisher"

I lurked for about a little while too before I decided to register....and came to the same conclusion that you did after visiting a bunch of other fishing messageboards.  Stick around...it's a great place to waste away your day at the office....ummm...I mean occupy your non fishing time.  Cliff"
170351,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-03-12 15:00:00,160,"  Well I don’t have a specific fish that I seldom fish for… I will fish for anything, but never did Pike, Musky, walleye. I would like to try pike this season, but I don’t know much about it… where to go and what to use.  I usually fish in GTA, islands, Pickering, rouge, Frenchmen’s bay, Rotary park, duffins, bluffs etc."
