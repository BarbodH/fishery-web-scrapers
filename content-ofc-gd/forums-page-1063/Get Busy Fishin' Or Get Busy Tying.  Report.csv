176065,Moosebunk,2008-03-25 13:03:00,3970,"Thanks guys.  Chris, Kesagami report is in the making.  Some hitches this year in the plans but it will arrive in the coming weeks.  So far so good.  WallyB.  Everything that comes out of the dirty Abitibi is freakish in nature. lol.  You know that.  The clarity turns everything pale... real pale.  Yes, the road was a benefit to the community this year.  First time ever having that kind of access to south.  The local hockey tournament weekend saw 253 vehicles cross the dam at Otter.  I hear Hydro didn't like that much.  New hydro lines are pretty much in now so next year it will likely be back to the same isolated normal.  I didn't take the drive.  I hope the community finds funding to open it themselves in the coming years as it seems to be harder to reserve space for vehicles on the train now that development in the area (DeBeers and all other things DeBeers) is booming.  About the MNR... yep, you'll see and read more on that in my winter Kesagami report to come.  It's great seeing them out there protecting Ontario's trophy fishery."
176068,wallyboss,2008-03-25 13:17:00,1095,"They didn't show a good map of the road in the article,  does it cross the dam at Abitibi Canyon then back across at Otter??  Or the other way."
176094,Moosebunk,2008-03-25 14:11:00,3970,Exactly what it does Dan.  Opening the world of fishing up to a whole bunch of new possibilities.  I missed out.  Should have been thinking brookies instead of pike.
176106,wallyboss,2008-03-25 14:36:00,1095,Would kind of make it fairly easy to go ice fish  Takwata. I think there is a motel of some sort at Abitibi Canyon which is now opened in the winter for the Snowmobile trail North Loop. From there it would be about 45 minutes ride on a sled to get to Takwata. Not sure if New Post band are there in the Winter though.
176123,John,2008-03-25 15:16:00,2956,Amazing report as always Drew. You always leave us yearning for more when we reach the end.....
176137,setomonkey,2008-03-25 15:46:00,872,"Great report as usual. Your reports are among my favorite to read, because you don't just focus on the fishing and catching, but also about the local geography, a little bit of history sometimes, and of course the scenery too.  Thanks, Mike"
165541,bowshep,2008-02-28 16:01:00,378,Nice work on the Flys.

165563,shane,2008-02-28 16:52:00,652,Thanks for the great report and story.  I always like hearing about life up in Moosenee.  Nice flies too.

165652,moemoe,2008-02-28 20:34:00,352,"Captivating story as always, you have a way with words, and a talent with flies"
165654,Ramble,2008-02-28 20:41:00,713,"Another Gem of a Report Bunk. Your fly tying is getting pretty damn good, definalty better then I 've been capable of in the last year or 2. Thanks for the picture of the flies...i almost forgot about my fly post....almost lol  It's closing in on march ...how many days till you hit the K-Sawg??  -R-"
165762,Moosebunk,2008-02-29 00:55:00,3970," Not this weekend Dave but the one after is when I'll likley start the trips in with Bren.  She's picking up live minnows next week and I have a dozen or more frozen fallfish for deadbaiting.  I can tell ya, I live all winter for these 3-4 weeks in March.  Aiming for a 25+ pounder or a 45+ incher.  MNR is reportedly setting up camp in there this winter."
165767,irishfield,2008-02-29 01:08:00,26272, Getting low on fuel money for the TBeaver eh ! LOL
165775,danc,2008-02-29 01:33:00,4677,"Can't wait for your Nipigon Report MB. With any luck, I'll be in it. Keep 'em coming Bud.."
165800,Jen,2008-02-29 02:21:00,833,"I read your reports, on the edge of my chair, wanting to move ahead faster, to see what comes next, my eyes darting forward as quickly as possible... rivetted... Your every word brings your adventures alive.  Well written, well said and even more importantly well lived.  Your an inspiration... in so many ways!  Thank you for sharing  Jen  He will be alive always in you... your friend!"
165821,Ramble,2008-02-29 03:19:00,713,I'm glad someone has got the MNR motivated the MooseCree Band guys who were down in teh summer were NOT happy about the reports of the walleye being netted. I wonder who gave them that information???  -Ramble
165822,OhioFisherman,2008-02-29 03:19:00,6623,Great pictures! but better with out the snow and ice!  Nice job on the flies!
165824,Tybo,2008-02-29 03:24:00,1373,Sweet report Drew.  I had to read it in segments so I didn't get caught at work flaking off  Joey
165825,Joey,2008-02-29 03:26:00,9122,"Dang, I really should see if I'm logged in before I post.  See above  Joey"
165917,Moosebunk,2008-02-29 13:56:00,3970,"Thanks very very much Jen for the kind response.  Appreciated, and happy you enjoy my reports.   Thing of it is Dave they could be there for a number of reasons.  1.  You know the Band here is in charge now.  Their ""Adventure Corp"" has bought the lodge.  Now that they are invested they will protect.  It's hard to say if an MNR presence is found in there this winter, that it was the result (maybe even help) of the Band.  2.  MNR has known for some time of the plane loads of walleye being scooped up out of there by poachers out of Quebec netting and fishing illegally in Kesagami.  (especially down Newnham)  The local outfitter here counted 13 private planes on ice over one weekend a few a years back.  Poachers filling their planes, flying out, picking up beer and flying back in.  They all head east to cross the boarder where they're then out of OMNR jurisdiction.  I've been on the ice and see a few planes come and go myself, but, they're a little shy to land around us now.  3.  MNR has been in there the last 2 out of 3 years.  I've been checked by them.  They've come with OPP air support before too, so they're looking to fry big fish I'd think.  One of the fellas involved with the Band's ""Adventure Corp"" is a racist pr!ck.  I wouldn't put it past him to complain to the MNR that I'm going in there, or that ""whiteman"" in general are going in there, because afterall... anyone non-status is just a trespasser on Traditional Lands.  (as an aside) - Heck, I took a group skidooing into a rarely visited back lake about 5 years ago, only to go back a week later to find trail accesses signed up with ""Traditional Territory"" signs, and word from a hospital employee that this fella was at our work telling people to make sure we have our fishing licenses and to not leave garbage in there.  (we left a burnt out fire pit in the middle of the ice and four auger holes)  You should see the dump he and his father have left in there.  5 years of his ""respect for the land and waterways"" has settled the little lake with a couple cabins to get drunk at every spring.  4.  Charlie seemed some interested in my winter excursions in there.  Heck, I published my successes fishing on that lake.  From the Detour Mine Road it's not all that far to skidoo in there, even though snowmachines aren't allowed in the park.  I am sure that winter ice fishing exposure for that lake wouldn't be in Charlie's or The Band's best interests.  Again, protecting assets.  Charlie did not like hearing about the netting when I told him.   Thing is this Dave.  If the lodge was to fold up again because of mismanagement it's still a win - win situation for MooseCree.  They will continue to have it making money, or it'll remain protected park from non-status and yet with full Native usage."
165927,solopaddler,2008-02-29 14:19:00,8605,"That was epic bud, great read!  Appreciate the time it took to write that up..."
165933,Greencoachdog,2008-02-29 14:34:00,8163,"Great report and pics!!!  It looks like you've got the fly tying down to a fine art!  Congrats on the Ling and that's an excellent Walleye, although he does look very cold for some reason."
165957,dannyboy,2008-02-29 16:12:00,367,"You have a great talent for writing; your posts include the entire experience, not just the fishing. As a reader I feel I am sharing your adventure.  Thanks Dan"
175987,scuro,2008-03-25 04:13:00,386,"I was actually searching for the yearly Kesagami report when I stumbled upon this gem. You are still one of the few who can immerse me into a report and leave me in a better state coming out the other side. Nicely done once again, my friend. Pics are first class too!"
176043,wallyboss,2008-03-25 12:21:00,1095,"Bunk seems like the letter to the MNR last year worked!!! There was a 2 page story in the Ottawa Sun on Saturday about the ice road from SRF to Moosenee, good reading.  Those Northern Ontario lings are of a different color than down around here for sure. Used to catch lots on the Mattagami in the spring."
