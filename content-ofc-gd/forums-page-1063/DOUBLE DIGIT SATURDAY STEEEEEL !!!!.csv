Water had cleaned a up a bit more overnight to make for about 15"" visability...As I put my neoprenes on , a couple guys came up from the river to the parking lot to pack up both saying the same thing : ""How'd you do ? "" "" Ah way to much slush ....to cold....can't even fish. Its not even worth the walk"" "" Oh, ok thanks""......As I smiled and chuckled under my breath  Walked down to the hole I left off at yesterday and ahhhh not a sole in sight first 5 DRIFTS  = 5 FISH !!!!! couldn't beleive it... left that hole after about 8 fish as my azz was  freezing having to fish in the shade.....Others around did ok but like CC says, FRESH ROE is everything !!!  Went 11 for 13 from 10:00AM -2:00pm.....One of my best pre season day's in a long time !!!            "
174984,ccmtcanada,2008-03-22 21:15:00,7971,Fantastic!  Congrats on a great day out there!
174985,fatherof3,2008-03-22 21:20:00,1769,congrats on an awesome day
175009,fish_finder,2008-03-22 23:45:00,370,"Jeez, theres nothin wrong with that at all!!!     now, could you email me the gps coordinates of that 8 fish hole???"
175095,jdmls,2008-03-23 04:14:00,575," LOL, if I only knew !!!"
175107,kennyman,2008-03-23 05:33:00,737,WOW!! Beautiful.   I've got to learn how to do that.
175108,Milty,2008-03-23 05:34:00,121,"nice work on the double dig's,..nice to see you got into some good action with notta crowds... the last one you were holding looks pretty decent compared to the others...were you using chartruese roe bags?  reason i ask is that im tying up for monday, water should be nearly back to normal by then,...how was the fight on?  any jumpers?"
175118,b2kptbo,2008-03-23 11:16:00,1505,"Gotta love days like that, WTG..."
175144,ehg,2008-03-23 13:35:00,2666,"Nice post! It's hard to get a photo of those squirmy things. Looks like a memorable day. No crowds either, thats pretty good.  thanks for posting,  ehg"
175146,sonny,2008-03-23 13:41:00,511,nice job!!
175155,jdmls,2008-03-23 13:56:00,575," Pictures don't do justice, my friend...majority of the fish were pushing 6-7 pounds with a couple over 10...I hooked one that fought for a solid 10 mins and I still couldn't even get its head up....Those females get heavy this time of year when their stuffed full of eggs. Jumping...more like just a lot of rolling and bulldoging...rainbows rarely jump in March -10 degree weather.....bag color didn't make a difference. White , chartruese, yellow, pink they all hooked fish... like I said ""FRESH ROE IS THE KEY"""
175186,canadian_copper,2008-03-23 15:12:00,925,NICELY DONE BRO!!! STILL STUCK AT HOME HERE!! GEUSS THAT HELPS THE REST OF YA OUT  LOL GONNA BE ANY LEFT BY THE TIME I GET OUT??LOL

175409,pikehunter,2008-03-24 01:19:00,1659,"Great report, making me think it very well is worth the trek out in the cold and getting a frozen azz out of it."

176375,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-25 22:35:00,1183," lol...sneaky...mind you I have thought about doing the same thing....but I am just too darn honest...but I'm learning, I'm learning. Great post, thanks for sharing."
176508,jdmls,2008-03-26 02:14:00,575, naw i think those guys were telling the truth about their day...The slush was bad but its all about fighting the elements...and working with the conditions
