Grabbed a small hand auger and a handful of jigs and off we went. Drove around a bit and decided to try a small bay near Minden for whatever.  Punched the first hole through about 10-12 inch of ice and started to jig.  Not 5 minute later my son yells fish on…only to lose the fish at the hole…a bright coloured fish either a white or cisco.  10 minutes later he yells again, “I got you this time…but it's a dark fish”.    Small Laker, Sheldon’s first trout of the year.  Quick picture, put er back.    We had 5 or six fish on but only able to land this only fish… Couldn’t think of a better way to spend couple of hours...  Good fishing."
