176725,evster,2008-03-26 14:53:00,367,I caught one this past weekend.  Just had a smelt on a hook on bottom.  It spit out some macaroni when I got it up on the ice...maybe thats the key bait
176728,walleyejigger,2008-03-26 14:55:00,876,"caught one last week, jigging in about 100' of water with a spoon for lakers, not what i was targeting but that's how i caught it"
176762,Hookset,2008-03-26 15:34:00,367,"- head to your favorite Laker grounds - fish between dusk and dawn - salted minnows on a spreader - right on bottom - chum holes with same salties - don't blame me when everything you have brought with you is covered in slime  seriously though, they are fantastic eating.   Hookset."
176778,wuchikubo,2008-03-26 15:57:00,1114, Now I'm sure someone said that when I put their first worm on their hook but now their hooked on fishing and will put their own worm on.  It's just another fish I want crossed off my list of having caught. The fact that many also list them as a good eating fish also helps. They are listed as coarse fish and haven't a season or a limit (right now anyways) make them a good inbetween season species to fish for. I've heard of good size specimens as well.  Anyone want to hook up for fishing for ling?  Stan
176786,walleyejigger,2008-03-26 16:04:00,876,   ahahahahah now that's funny right there
176788,irishfield,2008-03-26 16:05:00,26272,Ling fling was last weekend in Temagami. 300 people out to eat it can't be wrong !
176801,wuchikubo,2008-03-26 16:22:00,1114, Doh!  I knew I should've asked earlier.  Although Temagami is a bit too far for a single nighter trip.
176979,Woodsman,2008-03-26 20:03:00,1286,Just after dark is the best time. Shallow flats (15'-35') beside a drop off to deep water. Live or dead bait on bottom. Glow in the dark spoons jigged also catch fish & draw the ling into the area. Tip Only fish one line per person if fishing in a hut or close to the other lines. Lings like to circle & will tangle all nearby lines quickly. When one is hooked pull all nearby lines fast.  Good Luck: Rick
