175280,Bernie,2008-03-23 19:33:00,3190,"She's an awesome fishing partner. Baits up, lands and unhooks. Now if I could just get her to clean them. "
175287,Moosebunk,2008-03-23 19:49:00,3970,I'D ONLY WISH SHE'D WANT TO COME OUT MORE.              This year it'll happen.  She'll get bitten by the same bug the rest of us have.
175292,Tinman,2008-03-23 19:58:00,376,My wife hates it! but my 5 yr old daughter is always up for a trip! Thats her fish in the avatar picture!
175358,BillM,2008-03-23 23:14:00,17367,"Unless it's 80 degree's out and I have a nice place where she can lay out in front of the boat to sun tan, I don't even bother asking."
175394,JeffBornFishin,2008-03-24 00:47:00,260,Wife will go every chance she gets.  Sometimes I get too busy unhooking fish for her to keep a line in the water myself.  Would be nice if she would handle the fish herself.  Funny how we never go empty handed out of BPS.  Always spotting something new and interesting and she just has to have it.
175402,mepps,2008-03-24 01:07:00,1301,"Mine likes to catch em, jsut doesnt like to hold em!  And as long as we arnt fishign for shark, or using live bait she is happy to join me!    "
175452,LundGuy,2008-03-24 03:09:00,169,"Well its nice to see the gals like to fish. There are some pretty awesome pictures of them showing off their fish. Many that would envy even the most skilled, hardened fisherman.Great to see and hear from the folks who love one of the greatest sports and hobbies on earth.  Thanks folks and nice to hear from you all. LundGuy"
175483,maybe,2008-03-24 04:56:00,307,"Hey - if something's thrashing around with hooks sticking out of it, I'm gonna let you be the big tough guy!  Look on the bright side - whenever I catch a nice fish, you're the one in the brag photo."
175531,cranks bait,2008-03-24 12:52:00,721,"Sunday rituals are usually me going out in the morning to fish.  Come back at around 1 pick up my wife.  We usually get lunch from the harbour snack bar then head to a calm area to relax.  We usually swim a bit then I will fish while she reads a book.   When I hook into one she gets really excited to see it fight.  She makes a really good net keeper.  Every now and then she picks up a rod and takes a wack at it.  She still gets upset that I have lures bigger than the fish she catches.  Being that she was a Dave Mercer contest winner she now has her own stuff and is excited to get out and try it again.  I've also caught her at the cottage fishing off the dock when she thought nobody was watching, put a smile on my face."
175548,nancur373,2008-03-24 14:19:00,1211,That's ok man. She'll be great company tho.
175641,Scott S,2008-03-24 18:19:00,203,"We made a deal that she had to tie her own knots and put her bait on. Now we fish all the time when we can both get . The only thing she doesn't do is take of her fish, She was jabbed by a walleye and that was the end of taking off her fish Scooter"
175762,discophish,2008-03-24 22:50:00,392,I told her she can either take an inner tube or swim noodle to fish on from now on ....  I hid all her gear.    and replaced with this:  
176240,Fishnfiend,2008-03-25 18:54:00,357, Perhaps Cliff can give you the name of his support group for guys who get outfished by their ladies.
176268,ccmtcanada,2008-03-25 19:25:00,7971," I used to go to www.crymeariver.com, but bly pulled her PB Steelhead out of it."
176277,SlowPoke,2008-03-25 19:40:00,2984,Well done Cliff!! One of the best one liners I've heard in a long time!!!! -Brian
176280,Joey,2008-03-25 19:43:00,9122, That's flippin hilarious Cliff.  Joey
176374,discophish,2008-03-25 22:34:00,392," That is super funny!!!  Good one!  I looked into the ""World's Most Smallest Violin"" support group for anglers, and stumbled upon this image:    ... and beneath it wrote ""Cliff played this for Bly when he caught his 14lbs pickerel.  She broke the violin over his head it, unstrung the bow, tied on a lure, and used it to catch her 15 lber""  I decided not to join."
176396,Zubris21,2008-03-25 23:08:00,563,"I took my girlfriend out fishing for the first time about 2 years ago and she's been hooked ever since....  Luckily she bates her own hook, handles the fish and cleans them.  This was her first cast and her very first fish...   This was the very next cast, her second fish...  Steep learning curve I guess.   Then my buddy and I brought the girls on a Walleye fishing trip... guess who caught the biggest eye of the weekend...    figures"
176546,ccmtcanada,2008-03-26 02:53:00,7971, LOL!!!! Ok...pick on Cliff day is over.
175081,SlowPoke,2008-03-23 03:06:00,2984,"Getting back to the topic at hand (sorry Lundguy), I've never fished with my wife other than a few minutes off the dock. I'd like to get her out this year but I suspect she'd enjoy reading a book on the bow moreso than chucking lures. -Brian"
175104,scuro,2008-03-23 05:03:00,386,"  I have a nice picture of her with a large pike but I thought I'd show a new pic of my lovely yellow marshmallow. She likes to fish and she likes to shop to fish. Notice the new flower print boots...she enjoyed buying flats boots recently too. But when it comes right down to it if we are there to fish, and there is action...I couldn't ask for a better fishing partner."
175110,OhioFisherman,2008-03-23 09:09:00,6623,"My wife has, she likes fishing in Ontario and New York a lot more than here in Ohio, she can cast a spinning reel ok but is a bit baffled by a baitcaster. Has to be 75 to 85 and sunny though, and not a lot of casting, she would rather fish live bait and let it do the work. All 3 of my girls are more interested than my son, go figure."
175113,Rich Clemens,2008-03-23 09:49:00,3131,"My wife goes out with me as well and fishes for as long as the patience holds out - which does surprise me at times.   If the catching is slow or non-existant, she sit down to a good book and let me keep right on fishing - as long as I want.   Sure - when I catch one, the book gets put away ... for a little while anyway.  It doesn't matter to me whether Patsy is fishing or not.  More important is that we're out there together, whether we're fishing or doing our own thing."
175114,medmart,2008-03-23 09:59:00,587,Not mine she is afraid of the water every time i ask and tell her how safe it is it's still no way but the good thing is she lets me get what ever i need for the sport  Rob
175115,pikehunter,2008-03-23 11:03:00,1659,Yes she does go fishing and sometimes outfishes me! But that's OK it helps to build interest. She is tied for my 1st favourite fishing companion. Now if I can only get her to take her own catch off the hook and to thread a worm herself....  OK there goes my mind off on a perverse tangent again
175120,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-03-23 11:18:00,1362, My wife is exactly the same as yours Rob...but she's a sweety and encourages me to get out as much as I can!!...a lot of my fishing electronics have have come from her on B'days and Christmas....   :  Steve

175122,splashhopper,2008-03-23 11:31:00,2931,"ummmm.. my wife says: "" honey why aren't you going fishing yet ? You were so much happier when  u were fishing everyweekend last fall   .  I asked her if she wants to come fishing with my youngest daughter and i this spring and she said she would try it.  So, we will give it a try.  I hope she likes it and catches a fish.  Kinda reminds me of the time i took her golfing with me on a pitch and putt course. She has a great natural swing and we were laughing our butts off...  Then it started raining...and she REALLY STARTED laughing cause i promised to take her shopping as soon as we finished playing golf"
175133,Mike the Pike,2008-03-23 13:06:00,3421,My wife go fishin NOT  but she expects to eat walleye when I come back.  She does not understand catch and release.  Thankfully I have my son.  My daughters are losing interest    
175167,Golfisher,2008-03-23 14:17:00,586,I picked up fishing just to get away from my wife for a few lousy days a year!

175183,Deano,2008-03-23 14:59:00,767,"My wife loves fishing except  not on big water not at night not if the bugs are out not if the fish aren't biting not if it's not too hot not if it's not too cold not if it's raining not if it looks like it might rain not if were gonna be there too long not if the dogs won't sit put not if the waters have any waves not if the wind is blowing and a few more I can't think of right now,  but  yeah, she loves fishing."

175222,Rich,2008-03-23 17:22:00,3927,I rarely fish with anyone else anymore. She gets angry if I go out fishin' without her!
175223,tdotfisherman,2008-03-23 17:25:00,317,"My girlfriend thinks I'm fishing obsessed, which may be a tad bit true. She doesn't mind fishing, but she's not really into the whole casting lures, searching water, working structure and all that like I do. She just likes putting a worm on a hook or a jig, and patiently waiting for a fish to bite.. to each their own.. but at least she doesn't hate fishing or anything, and I think by now she's taken the hint that any fishing related stuff makes a great gift!"
175225,danc,2008-03-23 17:30:00,4677,I bring this Gal with me a few times a year. Please ignore the guy standing behind her.

175040,Greencoachdog,2008-03-23 01:44:00,8163,I'd really like to... but that means she would have to go outside... and that just aint gonna happen too often.

My last girlfriend was no exception:    This bass that she caught flipping was just two ounces shy of my personal best. A personal best, I might add, that took me 21 years to accomplish. She did it in two years.  Good thing we broke up...  I think I'd have a hard time dating someone that didn't enjoy the outdoors in general, and fishing in particular......just too good of a thing not to share with a loved one.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
