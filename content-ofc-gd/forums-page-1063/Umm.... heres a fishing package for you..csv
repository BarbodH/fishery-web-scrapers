176151,Marko,2008-03-25 16:20:00,854,Those prices are unreal!!! imagine how nice of a boat you can buy for that much lol
176158,cranks bait,2008-03-25 16:26:00,721,That would be an awsome trip to go on.  Although I would prefer the money go towards a boat.  Just gotta find 5 people to go in on it with me.  Still cheaper than a week of Heli-boarding at Weigle's in B.C.
176162,yellowboat,2008-03-25 16:31:00,211,I'll take 2 weeks please.

176254,TJQ,2008-03-25 19:12:00,7806,I think that if you had alot of dough.. i mean alot of dough.. you could spend some time doing stuff like that.
