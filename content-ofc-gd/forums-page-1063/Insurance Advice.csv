I've got a propane stove/oven for cooking and a wood stove for heat.  My question is this:  Will my insurance company give me a hard time about the wood stove.?..I've heard they'll do that if it is your only source of heat.  My Father-in-law had coverage through his guy but he took out the policy 25 years ago and canceled it as soon I took it over.  His coverage is through his old union anyway, so I couldn't assume the policy.  What do you guys think?"

Since the cottage is 16km away from the volunteer fire dept they factored in the replacement cost as they figure the foundation would not be saved!!!  So long story short I am with Gore Mutual and pay a whopping $800.00 a year.  Good luck in your quest!!!"
