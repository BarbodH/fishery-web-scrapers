Ok guys it's time to step up to the plate View calendar entry  For those of you who don't have time to get involved with fish and wildlife programs or habitat planting etc. you can do your part by just going out for dinner. Yes it is expensive. That is because it is a fund raiser. If your not like me and spend hundreds of dollars every year to renew your multiple memberships to various organizations, you can give back another way. By attending a fund raising dinner like this one.  Pheasants forever does not release pheasants. They secure properties and restore them back to a hospitable state for our wildlife and not just pheasants but an assortment of species including allot of endangered ones. Even if you don't hunt, as fisherman you can appreciate how things on land affect the fisheries through runoff. A healthy land environment adds clean water for our fish to swim in. Having wild turkeys to look at on the way to the dock is a sign things are getting better.  Pheasants Forever Niagara needs your help this weekend just to get off the ground. They are hosting their fund raising dinner in Niagara on the Lake so it should be a classy deal. Dinner will be followed by an auction and from the conversation I just had with Ian Magee, there will be some awesome must haves up for bid. This is an event put on by sportsman for sportsman. I really hope the Niagara area sportsman step up to the plate  Also there is an outdoor speaker Dan Elliot, the  Provincial Coordinator of the Pheasant program from the MNR, with a  power point presentation. Dan will be able to answer all your questions and stress the importance of this program.  Michael Olsen Chef from Canada In The Rough, will be signing DVD videos.
