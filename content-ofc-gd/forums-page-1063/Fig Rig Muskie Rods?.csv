175689,Sebastian,2008-03-24 19:57:00,208,Been looking at Fig Rig rods for a while now and plan to buy a longer muskie rod in the 7'6-8' range soon. I want something for bucktails. I've limited it down to St.Croix(Avid or Premier) & Fig Rig. Want to find out some honest opinions on the Fig Rig. It feels very light but I`m not too sure on strength. Can anyone help me out?

175849,Fang,2008-03-25 00:43:00,1330,"Hey Seb  I bought a Fig Rig Tooth Tamer from JB's a few years ago. Just love it. 7'6"" 25-80lb - use it as a jerk bait rod, top water and has in a pinch worked out for bucktails but it is a little stiff  Very light and fits up with a Abu6500 or Shimano 400 series nicely.  I'm always looking for something different and everyone I know had St. Croix's  Looking at another one this year but for bucktails"
175870,Sebastian,2008-03-25 01:04:00,208,Thanks Fang. I like them too but just want to make sure because i've read mixed reviews online.  One guy wrote an article about breaking 4/8 fig rig rods  but other than that i hear they're great. Breaking that many rods most likely means he's doing something wrong. I think i'll most likely pick one up soon.  As for reels you're right. Cant go wrong with a 401 Calcutta. I spend lots of time (and money) at JB's and played with everything in there. Thats where i got the whole Fig Rig rod craving.  Thanks Sebastian
175909,Fang,2008-03-25 01:41:00,1330,sounds like deja vu to me  You'll be happy with the rod  I'm looking at the 20-50 now 7'10 but I tell ya I have no place for these 1 peice rods that are longer than 7'. My War Room at home here where I store my fishing anf hunting stuff has a low ceiling
176447,Sebastian,2008-03-26 00:59:00,208,Thanks Fang. Ya i am pretty sure i'm just gonna buy a Fig Rig Tooth Tamer along with another Calcutta 401.
