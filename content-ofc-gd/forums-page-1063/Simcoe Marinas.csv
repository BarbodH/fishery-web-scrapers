I am thinking of putting it on Lake Simcoe, after three seasons on the Kawarthas (Scugog, Chemong, Buckhorn).  Do you know of some good marinas on Simcoe that I can start looking at?  Preliminarily, I'm looking at Cook's Bay, since it's close to my home.  However, I'm open to suggestions too.  My major consideration is on-water distance to fishing ground.  I like fishing for any species, although I don't think I would want to troll for laker every weekend.  In general, I like casting a bit more.  My boat is 17' with 90hp.  I'd consider Simcoe to be a very big lake.  When it's windy out there, I'd have to stay away from the main lake.  Therefore, places that are close to bays or islands would be good -- at least I can still go out and fish on those windy days.  Any suggestion is welcome.  Thanks a lot in advance.  Jackie"
