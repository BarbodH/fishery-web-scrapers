72833,bigfish1965,2007-05-18 01:07:00,3382,Found me some drop shotting hooks and sinkers and got me some flouro...now just need to know the best way to tie this all together. Hoping some of the bass guys can help out. I'm hoping this becomes a killer walleye tactic for me.
72838,Greencoachdog,2007-05-18 01:14:00,8163,"It's the Palomar knot Rick, I haven't had very good luck with it... but I wish you all the best!  Ya may wanna take a look at these: http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...t=SearchResults"
72840,bigfish1965,2007-05-18 01:18:00,3382,Thems the hooks I got Dawg!
72841,Black_Blade,2007-05-18 01:21:00,258,Drop Shot Walleyes  That is a link to a good article about drop shotting...hope it works and hope it helps!  just copy this into browser if it don't work...www.in-fisherman.com/walleye_insider/articles/wi0407_DropShot/index.html
72845,Daplumma,2007-05-18 01:36:00,1961,Dawg is dead on its just a polamar knot with a sinker on the tail..splitshot will work and snag less than a bell type.Curious to see how it works out for ya with the eyes. Joe
72846,Sinker,2007-05-18 01:42:00,8692,"Its funny.....I've been drop-shotting eyes my whole life. For the longest time, it was the only way I knew how to catch them. Now the bass guys are using it, and come up with a fancy name for it....  I always call it ""the rig"".  The stand out hooks are good, just check your line once in a while, I find the line wraps around the hook, and wears the line out. I like a big split shot for the weight in snaggy water....it just slips off when  you get snagged.....easier/cheaper than a bell weight every time, and easy to adjust your height off bottom. I can't see the point of spending 4-5 bucks for a few of the clip on weights, when you can get a bag of splitshots for half the price.....and they do the same thing......??  I just use the improved clinch knot, and leave a long tag end for the weight. You'll catch eyes with that rig for sure.....no question about it!  Sinker"
72856,GbayGiant,2007-05-18 02:12:00,1780,"I like using a jig for the drop weight, might as well, unless you want the bait just above the weeds.   I was drop shotting using a 1/2-1oz jig with a wormharness last year and just letting the current do the work, it's a great technique for small current areas, just anchor, cast it out and wait, it worked great and I'll be using way more this year.  I like to use a swivel so the hook or harness above the weight/jig can slide an I use the improved clinch for everything."
72904,misfish,2007-05-18 10:40:00,29133,"Yes it is a palomar knot,but then you bring the line back down through the eye to have the hook sit gap up.  Dragging a tube as the wieght doubles yer odds.  Owner makes a great dropshot hook.  Also at the end of the day,I remove the hook and wieght and open the spool and let 100 ft of line or so drag behind the boat.This allows the twist in your line to untwist .  Myself I have found that a baitcaster works better for less twisting of the line.  Have fun with it Rick.  Sinker,I never knew either til a few years ago,we been using this tech. for ice fishing aswell for many years. Only fall back,it,s had to drift or drag on the ice."
72928,Bitsmith2k,2007-05-18 13:27:00,396,"i use the palomar knot as well.. and almost always tie that for ice fishing, i dunno why but it seems to be the only setup that works for me... never had any luck when we tried for 'eyes with it though.. good luck!"
72958,Tacklebuster,2007-05-18 15:55:00,303,anyone try dropshotting for whitefish?
73034,OhioFisherman,2007-05-18 20:51:00,6623,"You can also use pegged worm sinkers for the weight, they make some that are a simple cylinder with a hole, they don`t snap as much and with a rubber peg slide off easily if you get snagged."
73049,Mark Kulik,2007-05-18 21:53:00,348,"Hi Guys , the palomar is about the best i've used so far, and yes it works great on the Eyes! I haven't tried it on the whities, but it works great on lakers also, the key is to keep the hook horizontal, by threading the tag end back through the top of the hook eyelet, helps with this, good luck.  Mark"
73053,misfish,2007-05-18 22:33:00,29133,You see Mark I did learn something.LOL
