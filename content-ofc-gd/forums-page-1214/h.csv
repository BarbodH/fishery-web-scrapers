72885,wolfville,2007-05-18 04:35:00,396,Good luck on the larry and show us the pictures when you are back....
72895,Badger Shark,2007-05-18 08:15:00,291,"Good luck Al, hope you get some more big ones.  Is mini-me going with you?  Wait till you post a pic with one of those suckers that he catches everyone will see what a good fisherman a five year old can be.  We are all ready to head up to Crotch lake in the morning, hopefully we will have some good luck, this years weather looks like it will finally co-operate for a change.  See ya when we get back Minday night."
72992,Uncle Buck,2007-05-18 17:43:00,1000,"That was plan B, but the weather didn't look to good... 40-60% chance of rain...  still haven't seen a solid report coming from that area though..."
72995,tonyb,2007-05-18 17:46:00,1637,"I think the fishing will improve as the water continues to warm up.  I think it will really pick up once they finish spawning as well, should be soon.  Tony"
73031,Jackel,2007-05-18 20:48:00,25, I'll check the the temp this weekend down there and post it when I get back.  Jackel

He has been up this way since Monday but Maribeth and I were away terrorizing Montreal (and Roy) last Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday...Weather was lousy but we sure did see the inside of a lot of basilicas including this one next door to where we were staying...
