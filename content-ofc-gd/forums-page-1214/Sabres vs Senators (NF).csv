72608,tipupesox,2007-05-17 13:39:00,167,"Well all you Sens fans can put those brooms away.  Hopefully the Sabres can win game five Saturday, than let the head games begin.  Could it be another Sens choke............."
72658,RobHall,2007-05-17 16:11:00,261," The Sens have lost one game and we are already using the ""choke"" word.     Ain't going to happen non sens fans.  In fact i predict the Sens will lose again on Saturday, only to pull it out at home in game 6.  With that said...a true Sabres fan wouldnt give up, so for that....  FOTB "
72808,Jackel,2007-05-18 00:04:00,25,  Want to buy one cheep???
72916,98Fahrenheit,2007-05-18 12:00:00,108,Who watches HOCKEY NIGHT IN CANADA @ bloody 2pm in the afternoon on Saturdays?  Dumbass American stations!
72929,Billy Bob,2007-05-18 13:27:00,5865, I have to agree. That is a Crappie time to play hockey.  Go Sabres ! ! !
72936,tipupesox,2007-05-18 13:45:00,167,"Being from the States, I agree it is a stupid time.  I can see it occurring in the earlier series so you don't have programming contention but not now.  The game is going to cramp this weekends outdoor activities, might have to pull the TV outside and watch the game out on the patio.  GO SABRES ................."
72943,Puckhead,2007-05-18 14:09:00,377,^Good call!
73033,Northhunter,2007-05-18 20:49:00,214,"I like the timing. I thought I was going to have to choose between it or the opening day evening bite!  Now I can sit back, watch the game.. then hit the water when the little fishes are looking for dinner"
72313,blaque,2007-05-16 17:41:00,2419," Sour grapes is right, didnt you read my signoff? Bitter Sabres fan?  I give Ottawa all the credit they deserve. Theyve played amazing when its counted, end of the season and the playoffs. But they really need to be throttling the Sabres with their absence of any emotion or effort, in fact, Id go as far as to say its the most embarrassing team Ive seen in the post season in quite a while. So yeah, Id say the Sabres are doing their fair share to make it easier on the Sens. Im just pointing out, with all due respect, Ottawa better watch out that Buffalo doesnt lull them to sleep and lower their expectations for the finals. All that being said, i think Murray will agree with me and send your boys out for the KILL tonite! My sabres are gonna take that long, somber fllight home tonite. Very disappointing end to a wonderful year. Hopefuly we go in underdogs again next year, I think some guys let the all star status get to their heads this year."
72334,wallyboss,2007-05-16 18:30:00,1095,"Canadians would be better off cheering for the Sens, cause if they're waiting for the LAFFS to bring the cup home,  we'll have to wait a heck of a long time."
72423,Badger Shark,2007-05-16 22:21:00,291,"Oh boy Wallyboss, first post and your starting trouble!    Taylor is not here so calm down.  haaha"
72574,misfish,2007-05-17 10:38:00,29133,"I would say the fat lady lost her voice because she wasnt sing away last night,and boy did it ever go quiet at the final whistle. Sabres win the next one,I think your going to see a come back in 4 series."
72590,blaque,2007-05-17 12:37:00,2419,OOPS!
72591,Billy Bob,2007-05-17 12:50:00,5865,Does anyone remember 2004 when the Yankees performed the biggest CHOKE in sports history losing 4 straight games after taking a commanding  lead 3-0 in the American League Championship Series over the Boston Red Sox. I LOVED every minute of it  The Bo Sox went on to win the World Series beating the Cardinals four games straight. Best year in sports until............................
68744,RobHall,2007-05-07 17:52:00,261,"I don't expect too many folks on this board to be cheering for the Sens in the ECF.  But I think there are a few OFC members here, who are Sens fans.  I have changed my avatar for this series and will change it to the one below, if the Sens lose to the Sabres.    FOTB "
68769,easton13th,2007-05-07 19:27:00,371,HABS fan but in the event...GO SENS GO!  It's a canadian thing.  Easton
68770,98Fahrenheit,2007-05-07 19:29:00,108,The ONE and ONLY Canadian Team left .... gotta give it to them!  GO SENS GO!  (although I really hate Alfredsson)
68783,bassmaster4,2007-05-07 20:00:00,801,id rather have the sabres win the eastern conference final and then lose in the cup final
68786,bbog,2007-05-07 20:04:00,665,Anyone but Ottawa
68798,kennyman,2007-05-07 20:25:00,737,"Hate them both (I bleed blue and white), but GO SENS GO!!!! Bring that cup back where it belongs!"
68808,Hookset,2007-05-07 20:54:00,367,"Go Buffalo !!!  If any town needs a break it's that town. Good thing hockey doesn't need a place kicker or Buffalo would never win. Besides, you can cheer for the Canadian players on that team just as easy without having to admit you are a Sens fan."
68812,carp-starter,2007-05-07 21:05:00,253,"I am for Canada and so ---------  Go Sens Go - All the Way  fishinonthebrain, I used your photobucket PICS - thanks - I hope it is OK.  carp-starter"
68828,RobHall,2007-05-07 21:42:00,261, No problem carp-starter.
68846,Moosebunk,2007-05-07 22:24:00,3970,"Avatar is old news dude.  Sens have been there sure, but, it doesn't hold true anymore.  This is the farthest they've been.  They beat the League's best scorer and his support of young talent, then they turned around and beat the League's best goalie and cast of seasoned veterans.  Buffalo or Ottawa is a toss up.  Should be one heckuva series though, and, either team is worthy of beating the other.  Win or lose for the Sens at this point... no one can say they choked.  They've rolled over Pitts and NJ like a team possessed."
68870,silveradosheriff,2007-05-07 23:10:00,1025,Anyone but that cry-baby Ruff!  Go Other Team Go.
68896,xrap,2007-05-07 23:38:00,683,"Sens suck, Go Ducks Go!!"
68913,Carp,2007-05-07 23:53:00,1488,"As much as I despise the Ottawa Senators, I like the idea of the Stanley Cup remaining on Canadian soil, so.....GO SENS GO !!!"
68963,Bear,2007-05-08 01:25:00,106,will be an exciting series for sure   Sens in 7
68970,muskymatt,2007-05-08 01:35:00,2608,WOW   I'm shocked  All the leaf fans cheering for the sens  Sens  are playing text book hockey........no matter how you look at it.  Nice to have hockey in May .....isn't it ???  Go SENS Go
69019,fishdawg,2007-05-08 03:26:00,912,"as much as I cant stand Ottawa, I am affraid I hate Buffalo even more!"
69184,blaque,2007-05-08 19:01:00,2419,"This is coming from a die hard sabres fan.......They've gotten thru two series playing worse than they have all year against two VERY desperate and strategic minded teams that played just outstanding against them......and they still came out on top, somehow. If Buffalo ever gets their ""A"" game going, they'll eat em' up and spit em' out. However, i dont see that happening, their performance to date in the playoffs has been lackluster and uninspired. For the most part. Not to mentoin Ottawa owned us all season. I predict the Sens in 6 games. No way Buffalo is gonna make it thru to the Sens to the finals...........as vomit inducing as that is to say, thats just my take on it.  Oh and by the way, all coaches are crybabies.......Ive never seen one without his share of tantrums."
69280,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-05-08 23:37:00,0,Sens in 5  The Cup is coming back to Canada where it belongs.  It really is nice to have Hockey in May.
69299,tjsa,2007-05-09 00:09:00,1578,"Whut's Hockey??????????????? Who are the Sens???? I know what buffalo are, but how do they figger into this????????  :lol:  :lol:  :lol:  Go Jays"
69308,irishfield,2007-05-09 00:27:00,26272,LOL Tom ! And you're right...baseball is what's supposed to be played when it's 25C outside...not hockey.
69360,Abberz,2007-05-09 01:42:00,140,Go Sens Go.  Let me know if you want any tickets to the series I am selling the ones I have below face value.
69405,Badger Shark,2007-05-09 03:59:00,291,"I am not a leaf fan but if the situation was reversed and the leafs were the only canadian team left, I would cheer for them.  The cup has been gone way to long from where it belongs.  But if they lose to Buffalo at least it will be to the team that stayed on top all year and not a choke job this year.  I am very pesimistic when it comes to the sens but this year in the playoffs they look like a different  TEAM,  they are actually a team now.  So I guess we will just have to wait and see."
69410,holdfast,2007-05-09 04:15:00,1813,"Prediction..  Sundin, Koivu, Nasland spending the time watching the cup on TV Basking in the Nordic sun.  Next Alfedson.  If there is any rough stuff, which there could be with Buffalo.  I figure he will do a dissipearing act like the Sedin brothers.  But you never know, he could make Bettman proud by being the only non North American Captain to hold the Cup.  But I doubt it.  Ducks or Buffalo"
69415,lickmyarmpit,2007-05-09 04:31:00,359,Neither team has a chance at the cup so it dosen't matter. lets go red wings!!!
69545,blaque,2007-05-09 14:38:00,2419," The Sabres are a different team now......alot of teams have figured out how to slow them down, they arent the powerhouse that Ottawa has been in the playoffs. Season started from scratch in round 1.  If Ottawa loses this series, they better go find a deep hole and stick there heads,  collectively, .....and as a team.........in that very hole."
