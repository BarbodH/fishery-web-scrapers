72946,Paulus,2007-05-18 14:26:00,522,"I use fluoro as tippet when I'm fishing for steelhead & found that vanish was ok only if it was brand spanking new & on the first fish - and only in rivers where the line never comes in contact with obstructions or debris. Another thing to note is that it's not 100% fluorocarbon, so it is not as invisible as it could be. I switched to Raven fluoro, then to BPS and recently tried RedWing(#6.6). I like the Raven (when new); the BPS is definitely better; but I was shocked by the Redwing. It's amazingly thin, is 100% fluoro (or so it says on the package) and I landed 6 or 7 fish on one 4 foot section of it on the opener. I've never had a fluoro go through this much pressure. Not sure if this was just the luck of the draw, but I'll be trying it again. The downside to my comment is, other than BPS, my comment relates more to tippet than to line you actually spool onto your line.  p.-"
72493,Muskieman,2007-05-17 01:34:00,2472,I've used it and like the stuff .. but it's nothing to write home about I have'nt caught or lost more or less fish because of it..I 've returned to using Spider Wire on my Baitcast outfits and good'ol Trilene XL and XT on my spinning outfits.. i use my leftover Vanish Fluoro. for leaders in rocky areas for Walleye.   I say it's user preference.   GOOD LUCK   FISHIN!!   Randy....
72512,Zib,2007-05-17 02:17:00,369,I've been using the Vanish Transition for a year now & have no problems. You must make sure you spool it on the reel properly else you will get line twists. My buddy had the line twist problem because he spooled it wrong & I haven't had that problem. For knots you need to use nothing but a polamar knot & nothing else. The Trilene knot is useless for fluoro.
72518,MJL,2007-05-17 02:43:00,2427,"I tried the regular Vanish a few times over the years in different pound tests and didn't care for any of them.  4, 6, 10, 14lb were used and my findings were  - First time out on the water, each line performed great, no problems other than a little more memory than regular mono.   - Second time out on the water (usually next day or 2 days after first trip), the lines would coil like mad and would fray on basically everything - eg soft weeds, sand, gravel - Forget about using near zebra mussels. - At home I performed my own abrasion tests - Lines in 4-10lb test frayed while I cleaned the grime off with a moderately damp paper towel... WTH! I also had it fray on grass while doing some distance casting in the local park. - Knot strength (both wet and dry) was horrible using various knots - Trilene knot, polamar knot, clinch knot, improved clinch, grinner knot, uni knot, and uni to uni knots to braid. - Fresh lines would mysteriously snap on the initial run of a carp, 25ft up the line.  Other cons Too expensive to fill an entire spool with - Especially a large baitrunner, big-pit or larger spinning reels.  Better off sticking to other brands of fluorocarbon IMO.  I'm having my best experiences using other brands of fluorocarbon (eg Siglon and Scientific Angler) as leader/tippet material and hybrid lines like P-line."
72550,Sinker,2007-05-17 04:06:00,8692,"I agree with what has been said about vanish. I find its great for icefishing, or vertical jigging. I think casting with it really weakens the line for whatever reason. Its ok for leaders, but that's about it.  Sinker"
72562,Hooked,2007-05-17 05:33:00,891,"I tried Vanish when it first came out, seems like it hasn't changed according to your results Cliff. I really don't see the use of spooling up with the flouro they have to offer.  The way I see it, its meant for leader material."
72568,Photoz,2007-05-17 09:31:00,792,"I used 12 pound VANISH on my carp rod & reel, and found it was well named, because of line twists & break-offs (had the consistency of piano wire) it 'VANISHED' within a week from my reel. I next went to 15 pound P-LINE . . . .     and still use it, casts well, and other than having it cut off by zebra mussels, never had a carp (or salmon) break it in a straight tug-of-war yet! What I prefer over ALL others . . . .     ANDELINE, pretty hard to come by, very inexpensive, and a touch thicker that other lines of equal strength, but excellent right from 4 pound to 20 pound! I got the P-LINE for just under $25.00 (330 yards) taxes in, but the ANDE runs about $15.00 . . . . .     for 900+ yards!"
72575,tipupesox,2007-05-17 10:41:00,167,"I have used 4 lbs. Berkley Vanish for steelhead since the product came out.  I have never lost a fish to a knot failure.  My outfit consists of a 12 foot noodle rod, very soft action, not sure if the soft action will help by putting less stress on the line.  I do have tro agree with the coiling issues the line creates, can be aggrevating at times.  Cliff - How has the fishing been on Sturgeon?  I will be coming up next Friday with the family for our holiday weekend and will be staying up the lake from you at Gil Mar.  If you see a blue and beige Starcraft Islander (NY registration), give me a shout.  Tom"
72582,Wes Bender,2007-05-17 12:18:00,105,"This spring I bought a spool of Seagar florocarbon and a spool of Cajun Red Line to use as leaders for steelhead fishing. I can say with confidence that the Cajun Redline fooled the steelhead and the florocarbon did not. I literally watch the steelhead move out of the way of my in coming drift when using the florocarbon but they smacked it when I was using the the Red Line. I admit there may be other factors at play there but I had it happen numerous times on different days. I have never had a real full of either until now. All my walleye rigs are spooled with the 8lb RedLine. We'll see how it performs this weekend. I am heading out at noon today. Have to get there either to get the good camp spot. Everything is on fire up here so there are very few lakes to go to, that are not under Area Order by the MNR. It is going to be a busy weekend. Crap! If I have any bad news about the red line as a full spool line then I will make another post after this weekend. Up to now I have only used either as leader material. I also tried the Vanish a few years back. I didn't like it and promptly switch back to mono."
72615,ranger79com,2007-05-17 14:02:00,7,I fish bass touneys where I stand to win money and the only two floro lines I have found that is any good is seagaur and p-line. all others are too stiff and just break for no reason at all.
72628,tonyb,2007-05-17 14:31:00,1637," They were likely moving out of the way of your float and shot, not the flourocarbon leaders.  Tony"
72650,Wes Bender,2007-05-17 15:47:00,105,"No float, I was fly fishing. My tippet was long enough so the trout most likly did not see my shooting line. But it is likly that it did see my shot, what little shot I was using. Like I mentioned, could have been other factors not just the line. All I know is I won't use it again. Redline seem to do the trick for me."
72689,bowshep,2007-05-17 17:27:00,378,"Its Name is Perfect Hooks Vanish, Fish Vanish and the urge to use it Vanish. Peace Ken"
72849,Big Cliff,2007-05-18 01:50:00,6899,"Tom, fishing has been a little slow, we have had several cold fronts in a row and not much rain until the last two days. Bright days, clear water, and cold fronts, and post spawn stress all combined to make the walleye shy. It is supposed to warm up in the next few days, we've just had two days of rain, I think you could be hitting it just about the right time, I expect the action to start to pick up over the weekend and it should be in really good shape about mid week. Drop by if you get a chance and if you run into any trouble out on the lake with boat problems or anything, give me a call. 705-328-0750 ( that goes for any OFNr, if you are fishing Sturgeon lake and run into any problems, I'll do my best to help out.  Now back to the fishing line; I must say while I was not impressed with the product I sure am impressed with the support I have been getting from Berkley and their Canadian rep. Pure Fishing. I'll let you know more once all the facts are in but they are sure trying hard to help me sort things out and that means a lot to me!"
72908,tipupesox,2007-05-18 10:49:00,167,"Cliff, Thanks again for the information, if I am in need of any assistance I will give you a shout.  If time permits I may swing by, all depends on how much of my time is committed to the family.  Extended forecast looks favorable for next weekend, hopefully it will hold up.........   Thanks again, Tom"
