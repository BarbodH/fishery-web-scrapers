72874,Mike the Pike,2007-05-18 03:35:00,3421,Well I am leaving at 4am from Montreal if all goes well I should be launching the boat around 8 am in Deseronto at Mohawk Bay park campground.Looking forward to spending time with GlennK one of our members his Dad Ron and my Buddy Serge.Ron will be in at 10:30 am so I will have my partner for the day  .  It was a rough week my son Ryan(8) wiped out on his skateboard tuesday and now has a hairline fracture on his foot no cast but he is on crutches and should be OK in 3 weeks.Unfortunately no sports for a month.His soccer pratice starts this weekend.It was a stressful week and work so 4 days of fishing will clear my head.  Well hopefully I will have some fish pics and a report when I return Monday.  Good Luck to all who are fishing this weekend and please be safe.  MTP
