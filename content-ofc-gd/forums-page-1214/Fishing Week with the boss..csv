This is a good opportunity for me to get that promotion I've been wanting, could you please pack enough clothes for a week and set out my rod and tackle box, we're leaving from the office & I'll swing by the house to pick my things up.""  ""Oh! Please pack my new blue silk pajamas.""  The wife thinks this sounds a bit fishy, but being the good wife she does exactly what her husband asked.  The following weekend he came home a little tired, but otherwise looking good.  The wife welcomes him home and asks if he caught many fish?  He says, ""Yes! Lots of Walleye' some Blue gill, and a few Pike.  But why didn't you pack my new blue silk pajamas like I asked you to?  The wife replies, "" I did, they're in your tackle box.  Easton"

72796,glirw,2007-05-17 23:39:00,200,It's just that effortless to catch fish in Canada ! It's true !  .... unless you're on Lake Simcoe. No fish there.
