72784,mikeymikey,2007-05-17 23:06:00,376,"Hello.  Went to Lake Scugog to Goresky.  We rented a boat and started fishing just out side and around the marina and not a single walleye. But we did end up catching few huge jumbo perch.  and the weather got little too windy around mid afternoon and decided to call it that.  So, if someone here could help me out... How,where can I catch my first ever walleye from Lake Scugog?  Renting a boat and only catching perch sucks!  Some hints/tips would be appreciated. (oh we used worm and minnows)"
72811,Greencoachdog,2007-05-18 00:11:00,8163,"The Wall-ice bite when the boat rental place is closed.... early in the mornin' and at night, it's in their contract! You may get lucky and catch a suicidal one during daylight hours... but they will be few and far between."
72828,mikeymikey,2007-05-18 00:56:00,376,Well that sucks.  Rental open 8AM close 7:30PM.  = Close during peak hours.  Suck.
72848,Sinker,2007-05-18 01:47:00,8692,"Next time, head over to the nonquon river. Its pretty much straight across from goreski's. GCD is right tho.....the rental places are closed for the prime eye bite.  I've caught lots of eyes on the west side of the lake, across from goreski's, drifting the flats, casting small spinnerbaits. White or chartreuse, with double colorado blades. A worm harness drifted over the same area's will work well too. It needs to warm up a bit before the flats get good tho I think......  Sinker"
72850,Big Cliff,2007-05-18 01:55:00,6899,I have done well right out in front of the marina just past the marker bouy. Find the edge of the weeds and try working right along that weed line.
72852,fishdawg,2007-05-18 02:04:00,912,think outside the box & try something different
72959,Entropy,2007-05-18 16:15:00,747," Warm Up !!!      The surface water was 19 deg C last weekend, that might start to send them deep."
72967,lookinforwalleye,2007-05-18 16:43:00,4399,The key to finding early season eyes on the BOG is green weed find the new weed growth and you will find Walleye if your fishing last years dead weed you won`t catch much.
72977,Terry,2007-05-18 17:13:00,14456,"I fish the bog shallow year round...well the whole lake is shallow so that easy to do  but what Big Cliff said, works most times"
72996,tonyb,2007-05-18 17:48:00,1637,I got skunked the last time I was there (it was in the late fall though) so don't feel too bad.  I am convinced that there are no fish in that lake  Tony
73005,Sinker,2007-05-18 18:46:00,8692," 19 deg C is 66F.  If you found water that warm, you should have been catching. Where I was, it was tough to find water that was 60F. Most of the day it was below that. You need warm water to promote the weed growth........that's where the eyes are gonna be. I didnt' see any new weeds, and I fished all day non stop looking for some.  Sinker"
73016,mikeymikey,2007-05-18 19:48:00,376,"Well,,, weeds where everywhere already. Some parts on west side already had weeds to top of the water. While slowly moving along west side of shallow weedy water, I did see some what looked like a musky just sitting there and few bass swimming around.  and I did fish around buoy, which is where I caught all my jumbo perch."
73052,Big Cliff,2007-05-18 22:31:00,6899,Guess that's why they call it fishing instead of catching!
73119,mikeymikey,2007-05-19 03:16:00,376,  Isn't that a Scugog River?
73134,Sinker,2007-05-19 09:31:00,8692,"Nope.  The mighty scugog runs out of the lake on the east side of the lake into lindsay, then into sturgeon lake."
73165,ccmtcanada,2007-05-19 16:05:00,7971,I've rented a boat a few times out of Port Perry and never caught a fish from it....LOL.  The only thing we seem to catch are panfish...and my 5 yr old rules our family in that regard...  Hope you have better luck next time!
73167,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-19 16:26:00,191,Ya even on the Boq you get the odd ones through the day but like GCD said sun-up and sundown is when the bite is.
73190,mikeymikey,2007-05-19 18:14:00,376,"hmm ...  just like most of fish.   btw... people say look for fresh weeds. but like i said before... lake is already full of weeds... does that mean fish anywhere? i am guessing not?  sure buoy is good spot , i guess? but why is it a good spot? Obviously good because a lot of boats are surrounding that area."
73209,Big Cliff,2007-05-19 20:20:00,6899,"It's good because there are weeds right there but there is also a transion point there. Just to the West of the bouy there is a deeper hole. So, you have shallow water and weeds then deeper water and no weeds. It's hard to find better conditions than that for walleye. The weeds you are seeing are last years weeds, you need to find some new growth, this years weeds, They aren't up very high yet, the water has been too cold."
