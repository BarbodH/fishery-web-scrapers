I am used to seeing wildlife and have become accustomed to some areas having far more than others.  I saw: - 50+ mountain sheep - 55+ elk - 30+ whitetail and mule deer - 3 moose - 3 blackbear - 1 grizzley  This was all between Canmore-Jasper and then Clearwater BC. I also observed one brookie near Twojack Lake in Banff and 2 rainbows at the outflow of Maligne Lk in Jasper.  There was still ice on Bow Lk and an estimated 4.5+ ft of snow at this elevation. The Columbia Icefields were a bit too covered to really notice the glacier and its blueish tinge. It sure has changed since I was first there in 1986.  Just some notes. Mountain sheep always seem easier to notice on sunny days near sources of salt like by roads. Elk, etc. are always easiest to see during low light times, in areas like fields be it near a town or along the route.  outdoorguy61"
