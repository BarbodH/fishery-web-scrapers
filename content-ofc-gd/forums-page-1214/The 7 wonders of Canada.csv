72050,danc,2007-05-16 00:04:00,4677,"CBC is hosting a contest to honor the 7 wonders of Canada. There are 50 nominees. All are worthy of being in the top 7 IMHO. We (Thunder Bay) have one entry. It's called the ""Sleeping Giant"". It's what we see as we look out over Lake Superior every day. You don't have to look too hard to see the figure of the giant. His head is to the left in case you haven't quite figured it out from the photos below. We, as a city, are pushing quite hard for votes to try to get on the top 7 list. I guess you can call it a civic pride thing. The photo on the CBC page isn't quite so flattering, so I've posted a couple of my own which may, or may not, inspire you to vote for the giant. You can vote for 7 nominees at once. So I ask you, please vote for the giant, if you find it worthy. If not, vote for which ever nominees that you like. Here's the CBC page where you can view the nominees.  7 wonders of Canada  And here's a couple of my own photos of the giant. We'd appreciate your vote if you find it worthy. Thanks.    "
72057,highdrifter,2007-05-16 00:21:00,2534,Very kewl Dan!  You guys have my vote.  cheerio  HD
72060,Lostchild,2007-05-16 00:25:00,153,"You got my vote, as of now you are in the top 7. I think they should have submitted your sunrise/sunset photo of ""the Sleeping Giant"",  truly stunning!  18 000 submissions, I bet almost everyone of them are a wonder in there own right, we are blessed to live in such a beautiful country. Good luck, there will be no losers in this one!"
72064,martymonty,2007-05-16 00:37:00,26,"Cool pics DanC, enough to get my vote. I hope everyone considers Niagara Falls, no pics really needed! Best of luck to all entries"
72070,bucktail,2007-05-16 00:45:00,1857,I was thinking about this! Does it count?  
72077,Rizzo,2007-05-16 00:54:00,4754,"mmmmmm...Pamela has my vote.  She could wake that sleeping giant, but can he compete with Tommy Lee?"
72082,tjsa,2007-05-16 01:01:00,1578,"LOL, Pam is not in the final 50 as far as I saw, but I did make my vote for the final 7."
72123,charlied,2007-05-16 02:52:00,584,I also have a pic somewhere of a sleeping giant...but taken way up in quebec somewhere!
72142,danc,2007-05-16 03:44:00,4677," Thanks Lostchild. That would be a sunrise, looking east."
72143,snag,2007-05-16 03:47:00,1932,You got mine too!  Awesome!
72177,tundra,2007-05-16 11:17:00,18,If they need to be natural wonders....then Pam wouldn't qualify
72180,Whopper,2007-05-16 11:27:00,2174,"Awesome pics Dan! I always enjoy the site of the ""Sleeping Giant""!   Whopper"
72183,Guest mistyriver1,2007-05-16 11:43:00,0,"Very cool Dan, I remember you posting the top one before.  I watched a little bit on the weekend of some of the entries, we have a very beautiful country."
72191,Wes Bender,2007-05-16 12:15:00,105,Since man made structures count as a wonder then Canada's longest foot suspension bridge at Eagle Canyon should have made the list.  Nanabijou received my vote.
72200,rickster,2007-05-16 12:50:00,495,I am sure that the judges would disqualify Pam for being not totally NATURAL but Id still vote for her. Every time I'm in Thunder Bay I marvel at the sleeping giant.  You got my vote  Rick    Three more sleeps to walleye opener
72229,Hedfish,2007-05-16 13:49:00,76,"I don't know what's wrong with me, but I don't a giant in those pictures.  Still a beautiful scenery though."
72278,fishergirl72,2007-05-16 16:26:00,455,Hey dan im with you....i hope it gets to be one of those wonders...i cant wait to see the show and to figure out what they are...cheers
72279,fishergirl72,2007-05-16 16:27:00,455,Hey dan im with you....i hope it gets to be one of those wonders...i cant wait to see the show and to figure out what they are...cheers
72309,Joey,2007-05-16 17:27:00,9122,"Well I was torn between the sleeping Giant and Drumheller.  If you've never gone to Drumheller, it is the coolest thing to walk down in the amongst the hoodoos and quicksand.  But I did have your other picture of the Sleeping Giant as a screensaver for quite some time and enjoyed it every time I started up my computer.  But I figured out, you can vote more than once, so go for it Dan, keep voting again and again     I voted for both  Joey"
72865,danc,2007-05-18 02:36:00,4677,"Geez people. We're in first place. Canada has some awesome places, as we all know. In fact I'd personally pick a few others over the Giant. But we'll take it.  Our entire city had rallied to get votes for us, much like I have done here. The message to vote for the Giant has  been in the newspaper, on the radio and no doubt sent through thousands of e mails and message boards. Thanks to you that have voted for the Giant. If anything, it certainly can't hurt our depressed forestry based economy. If you have a moment, give the Giant one more vote. Thanks...  "
72954,wallyboss,2007-05-18 15:17:00,1095,"Charlied I think you mean the monutain top that looks like a hat.  They call it Chapeau de Taschereau.  And whoever said Pam on the giant, wouldn't that be the 8th wonder of Canada, ""The First retractable Ski Slope"""
72978,Joey,2007-05-18 17:13:00,9122,Looks like the Sleeping Giant has pulled into first place  Joey
