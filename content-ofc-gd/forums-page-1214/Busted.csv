71605,Terry,2007-05-14 22:34:00,14456,"well if it was sunday, I took off my coat and was just in a T shirt"
71628,Billy Bob,2007-05-14 23:45:00,5865," SO WHERE DOES IT SAY IN ""MY"" POST that I said not enough was done. Since I have NOT purchased a Ontario license in several years (this year will be different)  and your fish/game laws are different than here in NY State it was a honest mistake as to the consumption part. BUT that was NOT what you were referring to and YOU know that. At least I can admit to my mistake, how about you NANUK ? ? ?"
71636,misfish,2007-05-14 23:59:00,29133, Was that a small or extra small T SHIRT.
71649,ehg,2007-05-15 00:14:00,2666,"Ha Ha Thats what i was thinking as well. Forget the cheeseburgers it'll be deep- fried whitefish for days.  The registration #'s of the boat are quite clear, that should help.  Gutsy post.  ehg"
71773,Terry,2007-05-15 11:46:00,14456,"Jigatollah, what part of the lake were they in, I will keep my eyes open for them if it's near where I fish    oh and Misfish..piss off.....medium ......tshirt.....lol"
71777,misfish,2007-05-15 11:49:00,29133,"HEHEHEHEHE   Im thinking that posting that picture at all the launches/bait shops, would be a good deterent ."
71783,Hookset,2007-05-15 12:03:00,367,"Way to go Jigatollah. That's awesome. I'm kinda miffed at some of the responses though. Sounds like some people would rather ""stay on the couch"" and complain that ""nothing will ever happen"" than to do something like you did. Doing something is always better than doing nothing. I'm gonna carry that pic with me for a while, especially when I'm on Simcoe. Well done Bud.  Hookset."
71788,mattyk,2007-05-15 12:12:00,2110,great work!
71852,Jigatollah,2007-05-15 14:47:00,53,  They were west of Sibalds point probably out from Bonnie boats.
71859,Terry,2007-05-15 15:02:00,14456,"I was in the group out from Jackson point , so I will keep my eyes open for him thanks"
71893,Guest gbfisher,2007-05-15 16:23:00,0,SLYATV said he saw 2 guys on the side of the road SUNDAY that had 25 or so whities pulled out of their truck and on the grass...TO be counted.....by the MNR....HA HA HA HA.....  Can't believe what some will do for a bigger limit.... .Hope they were able to do something. Ya have to like the rights the OMNR have. Search and seize with out warrant as waiting for one can be to late.  GREAT JOB JIGGY!!!  
71895,keram,2007-05-15 16:32:00,585,"Regardless of the outcome you did........  :thumbsup_anim:    ,then   :clapping:    , and then   :worthy:"
71897,wuchikubo,2007-05-15 16:45:00,1114,"Jiggy, I applaud your efforts   , I hope the guys will get busted for poaching. But as many have said above, at least you made them think twice about doing again!"
72001,Slick Willy,2007-05-15 22:02:00,18, Ten or twelve beers will do that for ya too.  >Bill
72003,setomonkey,2007-05-15 22:04:00,872,Good for you for calling and taking the photo. Hopefully something will be done.  But even if they don't get hit by the MNR they now know that honest anglers are watching and won't just sit by and say or do nothing!  Mike
72878,Jigatollah,2007-05-18 03:49:00,53,"Just an update to the call I made last week. When I phoned in to find out what happened, the number called automatically switches to the region you are calling from. I'll have to wait until this weekend when I'm back on the lake to find out if they got busted or not."
72902,misfish,2007-05-18 10:33:00,29133,"Looks like the winds will be nil,see ya out there Jig."
72939,Shaky,2007-05-18 13:58:00,25,
71313,Jigatollah,2007-05-14 04:17:00,53,"While fishing Simcoe today for white fish. Myself and a friend noticed one boat leave and return a few times after catching their limits each. On their 3rd trip back, we watched them catch and keep 8 whitefish . The limit is 2 per person.I approached them with my camera out  and took a picture of the poachers. Once they realized what was going on, they pulled up their anchor and sped away. I phoned 1-800-222-tips and gave a report to a officer and I'll have to do a return call tomorrow and email them the picture I took. Hoefully they get what they deserve. Here's the picture of them in their boat.   "
71315,snag,2007-05-14 04:21:00,1932,PRICELESS!  Nice job!  Sure wish those numbers were clearer
71318,jediangler,2007-05-14 04:30:00,1923,Way to go Jigatollah. You are the Jigatollah of Rock and Rollah. Keep us posted. It's just too bad they didn't have a nicer boat to lose. The Force is strong with this one...
71321,majorlifts,2007-05-14 05:00:00,171,"HEY THATS ME!!!! Just jiven, lol, to bad you didnt catch em with the fish in the pic. I think that would make the case stronger. I think they call it evidence. lol hey dude just bustin chops. pretty brave good think they were`nt choice or angels, That could have been messy."
71322,majorlifts,2007-05-14 05:04:00,171,"WAIT!! WAIT,... ITS Randy and Mr Lahey from trailer park boys!!  Hahahaaaaa"
71329,Dano,2007-05-14 09:56:00,719,Well done Sir!
71331,Rich Clemens,2007-05-14 10:10:00,3131,The one guys pulling up the anchor does have a bit of concern on his face. Good for you jigatolla.  Hopefully they'll be getting a visit soon.
71335,Terry,2007-05-14 10:21:00,14456,very good lets hope something is done
71338,motv8tr,2007-05-14 10:26:00,2587,"Very good, hope something can be done about them...  Maureen"
71340,Billy Bob,2007-05-14 10:27:00,5865,You might of discouraged them from bagging more fish but I don't see where much can be done. All they have to do is dispose of the evidence and it's your word against theirs. And who to say they didn't consume their first catch and come back for more. BUT they will think twice before pulling off this caper again.
71346,misfish,2007-05-14 10:53:00,29133,"Hey Jiggy nicely done.  I would say they knew exactly what was going on,just by the look on the anchor mans face.  Im very surprised the MNR wasnt out there as they KNOW,whats going on out there and it,s not like they have to travel for miles to catch these type of guys.  Are you reading this Mr. MNR."
71351,motv8tr,2007-05-14 11:30:00,2587, What do you want to bet they can't afford the gas to get their boats out on the water...  Maureen
71352,mart,2007-05-14 11:34:00,93,Great Job!! Even if the MNR doesn't do anything at least these two characters might think twice about poaching again.
71363,Fisherman,2007-05-14 12:15:00,7201,"Uh oh, better check the rules on daily catch and consumption... What you consume on the day caught counts towards that days catch, so NO you don't go back and forth ten times to feed your extended family. 2 whities per person per day."
71375,BUSTER,2007-05-14 12:44:00,1336,nothing will come from this
71378,OhioFisherman,2007-05-14 12:54:00,6623,"Good thoughts doing this, but unless they catch them with the fish doesn`t it become he said she said? Got to believe they stashed them with someone not involved once they became aware of what you were doing? Still maybe it will prevent future crimes."
71424,NANUK,2007-05-14 17:33:00,797,"Jiggy, you have done good! that's the most anyone can do from one boat to another on open water without getting in to a confrontation etc. you have done more then most would have you can't win here tho, if a guy mentions about a poacher here, everyone says ""Don't just come here and tell us! why didn't you take pictures and call M.N.R"" well, you just did that!  and now some are saying that's not enough, ""its your word against their""  ""its not enough evidence"" give me a break"
71438,outdoorguy61,2007-05-14 17:58:00,220,"I applaud your efforts an hope you were careful, given that there are some crazies out there. Whether or not this was successful in a court of law, I believe that this would help a whole lot in making these two fellows ""think"" about their actions and possible consequences. Hopefully a few people that know them observed your post and the photo. Sadly, I bet they are in a defendable position.....I hope I am wrong.  outdoorguy61"
71441,Billy Bob,2007-05-14 17:59:00,5865,"Nanuk  I don't see where ANYONE said Jigatollah didn't do enough INCLUDING myself. What I did say it's their word against yours and WITHOUT evidence nothing can come of it. HOWEVER, I applaud him for his efforts.  You shouldn't put words in some else's mouth. I know I don't like it and many others don't either."
71447,bigfish1965,2007-05-14 18:13:00,3382,Poachers are usually not just one-hit wonders. Clearly these guys knew they were breaking the law by their various return trips. Hopefully this triggers a visit from the MNR. Quite often the poachers have other crimes they are trying to hide which can be discovered with a cursory investigation.
71454,NANUK,2007-05-14 18:27:00,797," Billy Bob,  I didn't mention anybody's name, neither do I have to put any words in your mouth, its you who typed the above response. NOT ME! please read catch & possesion limits in the reg book(page 3 & 4)."
71518,kennyman,2007-05-14 19:37:00,737,"That was an awesome thing you did.  . If nothing else you've at least scared the crap out of these guys.  I'm sure it's happening everywhere. It's kind of sad really,that a country as rich in natural resources dedicates so little of it's monetary resources towards it greatest asset."
71591,GbayGiant,2007-05-14 21:50:00,1780,"Good job bud. I agree though, they have to be caught red handed with the evidence unless you had video evidence. But if you stopped/scared them from thinking of doing it again than that is a good start."
71596,Big Cliff,2007-05-14 22:04:00,6899,
71598,didoban,2007-05-14 22:09:00,65,"some tough hide these guys, no shirt in the middle of the lake...today a bit breezy and 16C ? must really be getting a workout hauling fish."
