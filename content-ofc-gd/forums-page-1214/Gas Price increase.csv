73144,Guest lundboy,2007-05-19 12:30:00,0,"Well you pretty well know that it's all a scam when some government opposition people make a phony demand to investigate oil price gouging, and the slimy prime minister says ""there will be no investigations"".  It would have cost a ton of money to do the investigations, but at least he could have said something more placating like: ""Yes this is out of control and we need to look at our options"".  But we all know that as long as the politicians are on the take from big oil (especially Harper), we are all gonna get screwed.  Isn't it kind of suspicious that the same oil company that had the fire now has a power failure that will take a week to fix just before a long weekend?  After the long weekend they will lower the price slightly and that will become the new norm saying it's because the reserves are down even further.  Yet they won't spend a dime of their ridiculous profits to build new refineries!"
73148,Roy,2007-05-19 13:06:00,13728,"The price of gas is the same for everyone....rich or poor. I don't like it when the price of gas rises either. I could sell my boat, vehicles and the rest of the gas powered toys I have but I choose not to. You won't affect gas prices by squawking on a fishing board. Your best option is to put yourself in a position where you can afford it."
73156,Steelcat,2007-05-19 14:21:00,191,"We have to plan ahead to buy several horses to pull our boats (SAILING Bass boats).  All those government environmental talk is a way for them to get big bucks.  If they really want $$$ to research for the environmental friendly mode of transportation, I'm sure they can find the $$$ from all those free golf pass, $3 million office refit for Toronto's Mayor, $1 million airfare from our Ontario Preimer.  With 50% on gas, heating fuel, electricity, does our government want Canadian to stay home not going anywhere, start farming, and burn wood to keep warm in an apartment?"
73162,Mark Kulik,2007-05-19 15:25:00,348,"Well MRPIKE hit the nail on the head! everyone stay home for a week, spend time with the family and send a clear message!  see how the corporate bullies like that! the only way to hurt oil companies is in the wallet!!, I hear people saying buy a small car, I have one for commuting, but I work very hard, why should I give-up the sport I've enjoyed my entire life? sur I could sell my boat, but then who gets the last laugh. the trouble is trying to get everyone united!   the other option is to boycott one big company like Petro-can , then hurt them one at a time.  My 2 cents"

73173,jeffya2,2007-05-19 17:17:00,6,"We need to stop complaining & do something about it & I as well as several others have posted here that you need to buy oil company stocks. This is not a joke but sound financial advice.This is no different then hedging the Canadian Dollar fluctuation vs the American dollar. If 1 goes up the other goes down & you maintain you  your retirement dollars. Invest only $10,000 & you are hedged forever & this works even if you have to borrow the money.I did this after the rediculous prices in the late 70's with $25,000. I kept this in it's own portfolio to track it. I have never paid for ANY GAS PERIOD & 2 years ago I bought a fully loaded Yamaha V175 Pro Walleye Boat from this account. With all of this my investment portfolio is now $53,455 {After paying my gas & new boat} The time to do it has never been better then now & here's why. China's industrial demand is sucking up all resources faster then they can be produced. The USA is about to bring $20 million Mexicans on board who can now get a drivers license & hense a car & interest rates are still relatively low. Our gas prices are cheap by world standards & this is about to end with the new world order. It should be evident that we are getting squeezed out of the ""cheap Arab oil"" & all H is starting to break out over our future ability to get sufficient oil supplies. In the future {sooner then later} we will be happy to get oil regardless of the price. The world is made up of doer's & talkers. The future has never been so clear. In 20 years the doer's will still be driving cars {compacts} & the rest will be on Scooters & Bikes."
73270,Greencoachdog,2007-05-20 01:47:00,8163," Holy Crap!!!... ya mean I actually gotta work for a livin' now???... what a novel idea!  I've got my moped reserved for my T.O/Lakair trip, so if a blur with 2 large suitcases and a rod tube passes ya in the fast lane doin' 150kph.. honk, it's me!!!"
70779,holdfast,2007-05-12 11:14:00,1813,"Also, I live day to day.  I quit smoking 2 years ago in the hopes to add a few dollars so I can take my 14 ft aluminum and 10 hp second hand outfit to go fishing a couple times a year.  I can barely afford the boat launch.  My point here is since when in the History of Oil prices has gas gone up between 5 cents and 10 cents at a time.  The world Market is between low sixties and high seventies.  Katrina started an epidemic where the rich slobbering oil companies started the Phenomenal gas gouging.  Even the smell of a minor storm sends prices souring.  I'm a former soldier and "" YOU CANT OR IT WONT WORK WITHOUT TRYING IS NOT in my vocabulary.  Since when can a government cant control their own resources.  For starters you tax the Companies higher as they take our resources.  Maybe you can ease the price at the pumps.  Don't lie down and give up because now your giving in and you will be walked all over you.  Its human nature"
70789,bigfish1965,2007-05-12 13:03:00,3382,"Badger; It wasn't intended to be harsh, but to make people try and come up with a solution rather than just get upset. We've had a long history of trying to get the government to fix problems for us when something is wrong. It isn't always the governments job or responsibility to do so. By not using fuel wisely we've collectively driven up the price. By shopping big box stores rather than the local merchants we've killed small business. We've only ourselves to blame for a company that makes obscene profits. Price shifting is inevitable as companies that use fuel eventually have to pass increases along. Several trucking companies have fuel price surcharges already. As for dropping the tax..do you think it will result in a corresponding drop at the pumps? Our dollar is very strong resulting in lower costs for Canadian oil companies..but this never did result in lower prices. The one thing this will do is push more competition into the market as profit margins make new ventures more viable. this will bring down prices. Gas costs 1.13 because we will still pay 1.13."
70999,holdfast,2007-05-13 08:02:00,1813,"So Boys, let me know if your gas goes or went up since I STARTED THE POST. how MUCH, WHAT REASON.  They have an excellent marketing strategy.  Its got Rick fooled"
71002,Badger Shark,2007-05-13 08:20:00,291,"Last I saw when I went home the price was still at 1.09.7, but I am willing to bet that tomorrow when I head out it will be at least 1.11 or 1.12  And by next Friday up around 1.20.  I went out and filled my towing vehicle yeterday and my car and my boat and three 5 gallon jerry cans in anticipation of the big increase for the long weekend.  Total cost.......178.00.  Next week at 1.20   ouch dont even want to think about it.  Oh well I will be"
71064,frost,2007-05-13 14:22:00,6,"As much as I hate paying these prices , and knowing how much is tax, A guy at work brought up a point the other day.....  how many of us drop into the corner or grocerie store and WITHOUT even thinking pay 1.25 to 2.00 $ for a litre of , in some cases plain old well or tap water thats been run thru a reverse osmosis , or some other type of simple water treatment and slapped into a 2 cent plastic bottle lol...  In some cases, gas you're getting starts in Venezuala etc, supertanked thousands of miles to the refinery process, these being multi billion dollar facilities, then transported to your local station, and it's less in most cases per litre than your local groundwater stuck into a plastic bottle.  I know this doesn't come close to explaining the gouging , but does make me feel a weeeee bit better when i get  fired up over a 95$ a tank fillup on my truck hehe =)"

71129,fishfarmer2,2007-05-13 18:52:00,76,*Ok* My friends a few years back you rember when the (gas) prices shot up i forget then what the price was sorry. My buddy ask me to to go to his trailor park north of *peterborough* called the *Home-Stead* this was in the middle of (Summer) i couldent believe it the (Park) was almost empty . What going to happen now when the (Gas) goes up to $1.25 a litre . Look like no one will be in the parks any more to bad ?????
72426,holdfast,2007-05-16 22:41:00,1813,"Well as predicted our Gas jumped another (4 cents a record breaking 1.21) this morning in time for the long weeknd.  I love it, No Katrina, No New middle East Conflict, but fairley stable world gas prices.  I guess the other Oil Companies got to keep up with the 34% profit so far.  Wait till KYOTA or something similiar kicks in.  Hows things in Ontario?"
72448,gussser,2007-05-16 23:35:00,85,"Drill Alaska---Screw the caribou.   Seriously -has anybody got facts as to how many if any have been harmed?? More supply is needed. More refining capacity is needed. Government makes the most profit on fuel, (tax) as the price go up so does the tax. It is a %  Gov't won't lower that %. Oil companies won't lower profits. Shareholders wouldn't allow it.  Back to only answer. DRILL ALASKA      But I am building a wood burning car."
72544,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-17 03:46:00,2585,"if you stop buying gas one day for once a week, motnh or year.  the goverment will just raise taxes so the price will go up to compensate for it.  lets not blame gas companies for this.  the governmnet takes there huge amount of tax on this as well!  its funny if you think about it. if the gas companies make a billion $$$$ the government is making how much lol!  the way i look at it is gas prices are a bargain compared to what they will be 10 years from now.  Cheers!"
72553,mrpike,2007-05-17 04:11:00,151,JUST STAY AT HOME FOR ONE WEEK . (  EVERYONE  )   O and pull all money out of all  ( BANKS )  .  AND also make sure you tell ( GOVERMENT IN POWER )  THAT THEY WILL NOT BE GETTING YOUR VOTE AND YOU MEAN IT.  OR  just keep on doing what you are  doing . And it will keep going UP AND UP .

72619,lilkynan,2007-05-17 14:14:00,173,"Heard that there was a power outage this week in Nanticoke - so I guess gas will be $1.50 by Friday at 5 pm - May 18 - 2007  Also heard there was a poll by the governement asking if we would pay 50% more for gas to save the enviroment. Dont see how this will save the earth - just ensures that the pigs at the troph keep lining their pockets while the man gets screwed!!!  This is in the back rooms in Ottawa - 50% increase for car gas, heating gasses, electricity - to save the enviroment?????  Time to stand with arms!!!!"
72622,tonyb,2007-05-17 14:25:00,1637,"Gas prices will continue to rise.  We need to consider other means of transportation, what about horse and carriage?  Tony"
73131,holdfast,2007-05-19 06:14:00,1813,"Wow I guess I was wrong!  Gas went up 3 times since I started this thread, not two as I predicted.  Today I woke up and found it went up from a cent to two cents.  Broke the all time Sask record to 1.22.  Theres no stopping the increases now.  Looks like I wont be fishing this weeknd.  With the weather I might as well save my gas for a nice weeknd.  yea, Im definately into boycotting any gas company.  One day wont work but I bet a week will.  Or we can bend down and take it up the"
73138,Fish Farmer,2007-05-19 11:38:00,2234,"I think the government is trying to cripple the country can't afford the gas for the boat and truck to pull it. Time to sell everything and sit at home and not spend your money on Gas, boats, trucks, accommodations. ( unemployment big time) Ever try and pull a 18' boat with a Hybrid. Lets all get out on the 400 series hwy and slow down to 5 miles an hour to save gas. We'll all have the time because we won't be working. When was the last time you seen made in CANADA. It gets pretty bad when our government officials go to the corner store in a empty jet liner on our tax money.   Gezz, I forgot my blood pressure pill."
70476,Zib,2007-05-11 13:50:00,369,"The only thing we can do about the high gas prices is bend over & take it like a man. Don’t expect a reach around in return. It’s doesn’t matter what government you are talking about, they all could care less about high gas prices because they make off with the taxes on gas.  I think I’ll need to look into getting a good bike that I can tow a canoe behind.  I had to change my fishing plans for this weekend due to these gas prices. Was going to fish the north side of Lake St. Clair for some smallmouth (Michigan has catch & release season) but have since changed that to fishing the Detroit River for some walleye since the launch is less than 20 miles from my house.  I was going to fish the Kawarthas for the musky opener but that plan has been canceled."
70481,Flappn,2007-05-11 14:17:00,245,"I wont let these Gas prices stop me from what I want to do. We work to hard during the week and think way to much about what we want to do in our free time to allow The government and Oil Comapies ruin our plans. Yes Gas is more expensive, yes I will walk/bike more often, yes I will be cutting back in other areas to compensate however going up north and fishing are two things I am not giving up. Life is way to depressing as it is.  If anyone can think of a good way to protest against this..I'm in. Do I think there is a resolution...no....no one has come up with one yet.  Just get out their and enjoy it.....leave the worries behind. It may come to a point one day when most of us really wont be able to afford to do this anymore. So better enjoy it now!"
70490,Puckhead,2007-05-11 14:39:00,377,"Boycotts will just drive prices higher.  Gas companies want you to lower your demand - They want to supply less for a higher price. It's pretty simple, you get less for your money, they supply less and make more.   North America was built around driving.  Once economies start to suffer due to lack of car travel, the government might do something.  Until then, no one is forcing you to fill up."
70496,Golfisher,2007-05-11 14:56:00,586,"You can't boycott something whose demand is as inelastic as gas.  The necessities are great while substitutes are few and far between.  It'd be like boycotting air.  Oil companies will charge what the market will bear, and judging from the sustained demand, they will keep screwing us for the foreseeable future.  You want the prices to come down?  Pray for a recession, or for greed to take over petroluem industry as it did in the 80s."
