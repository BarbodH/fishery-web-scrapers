72971,glen,2007-05-18 17:08:00,2641,"So the back wood floor of my boat is a little soft.  I pulled a 2' chunk out and it was all water logged.  Then i pulled out a piece of the foam and it was water logged too.  A piece 1' sq and 1"" thick weighed 4lbs.  So i have no choice but to pull the whole floor out of my boat.  What type of foam can i use that wont hold water at all???  Can i use some sheet foam and some spray foam?  Thanks."
72985,tonyb,2007-05-18 17:37:00,1637,"I don't see why not, make sure it is closed cell foam so it doesn't absorb the water.  Perhaps someone with more experience in the marine flotation department can help though...?  Tony"
73019,Roy,2007-05-18 19:59:00,13728,"I would use the expansion foam sold in a can and used as insulation. It's VERY light, waterproof and dries hard. No cutting of foam...it'll expand its way into every crevice."
73023,Fishnfiend,2007-05-18 20:12:00,357,"Be careful with the expansion foam if you decide to use it.  The stuff can cause expansion where it is not desired.... They sell low-expanding foam, too."
73080,Dutch,2007-05-19 00:13:00,831,If you are using that canned spray foam be careful to read the instructions.  Some brands will only work if you hold the can upside down.  Wear eye protection and DO NOT get it on your skin.  I learned the hard way.  Use gloves and wear long sleeves.  I think I still have a bald spot where I had to shave off a bunch or arm hair.....  Good luck with the project.
73085,taper,2007-05-19 00:41:00,611,The foam under the floor of my boat looks very similar to the expansion foam you buy at the hardware storein a spray can.
73086,Zamboni,2007-05-19 00:45:00,235,"Go on iboats boat restoration forum, tons of info on foam. If you do put new foam in you need a closed cell type-how to's on install are important, foam is powerful when it expands so do read first. Personally, i'm in the no foam camp on restorations. All foam holds water, just not as easily....many boats out there are holding an extra 300-400 lbs of water in the foam."
73104,tomO,2007-05-19 02:10:00,363,"What I did was get the 4x8 sheets of insulation from Lowe's and cut it to size then I wrapped the pieces with  wide clear packing tape, it took a bit of time but that was several years ago and I pulled the back flooring section up the other day and it wasn't water logged at all."
73128,glen,2007-05-19 04:32:00,2641,Thanks for the help.  Zamboni brings up a good point.  Maybe no foam or foam in places above the floor would be better.
73132,danbo,2007-05-19 07:19:00,2646,Best excuse for a new boat I ever heard...   Wear a PFD & to hell with new foam.
