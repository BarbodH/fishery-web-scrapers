72961,niedmanns,2007-05-18 16:29:00,1,I will be heading out this weekend for the Bay of Quinte (Picton area). First time there for Walleye. Does anyone have any tackle recommendations? Any other info would be greatly appreciated as well.

Fished the east side from Picton launch passed McFarland park and had good luck.  Try the same just north near the bouys.  Good luck and play safe  Ken
