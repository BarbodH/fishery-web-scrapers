73126,bassmaster4,2007-05-19 04:07:00,801,I am going to try for brown trout this weekend as well as pike. I have never targeted brown trout before and they seem like an interesting fish. I want to catch one for i hear they are good fighting fish. I have a prblem because i have 10 lb test copolymer line and i dont think that will help in catching my first brown so i want to try fluro carbon leaders. How long of a piece for brown trout? Also what kind should i buy? Do i tie them on to a barrel swivel? I want to try bottom fishing with worms for them. I'm fishing a small part of the grand about 10-15 feet wide with fast moving water at some parts of it. I will try casting spoons too. How many lbs test should i use for brown trout and pike? or should i just use titanium or steel leaders for pike? Ill be throwing mepps x-raps and using minnows for pike.
