72535,fishboy,2007-05-17 03:22:00,550,"Hi All-I'm looking for some info on a public launch on Sparrow.  There's supposed to be one near the Silver Pines but I've heard that it is quite shallow there and difficult to launch from a trailer.  If anyone has some info or a suggested alternate, I'd appreciate the help.  Cheers"
72585,mart,2007-05-17 12:28:00,93,I'm not sure of a public launch but there's a good launch at Lauderdale (marina). Also down the river at the swing bridge there's a launch at the resort right beside the bridge.
72825,fishboy,2007-05-18 00:47:00,550,"Thanks, mart.  I'm hoping that someone has some info on the northern section of the lake."
72907,misfish,2007-05-18 10:49:00,29133,"Yep,watch out for rocks. That lake really isnt marked the best.Move around with caution when out of the channels.  Water is mostly clear at times,but once the big rigs start coming through,she gets dirty and they give off some good wakes. Be aware of your surroundings.   Enjoy."
72914,mart,2007-05-18 11:59:00,93,I think there's a resort on the NorthEast side of the main part of the lake but I'm not sure if they have a launch. Here's a link to it. Good advise from Brian about being cautious. There's some unmarked rocks/shoals off of the main channel. http://www.silverpinesresort.com/
