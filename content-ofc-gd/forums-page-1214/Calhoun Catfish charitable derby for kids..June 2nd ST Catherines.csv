73279,TangerineDream,2007-05-20 02:17:00,47,I volunteer every year at this event for kids. This is a charitable event for a good cause. Several open season species allowed. Many anglers in region of derby bring in some nice fish with their kids. Some big cats and carp. Good event for the family. I encourage anyone to fish the surrounding area and enter their kids. This is a great event with great prizes for the kids.  http://npcc.on.ca/foundation/catfish%20derby.html  Any questions please ask...  Remember it's all about the kids...
