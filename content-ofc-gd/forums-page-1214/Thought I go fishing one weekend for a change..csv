73208,dsn,2007-05-19 19:53:00,1018,Thought I'd go out and fish the weekend for once. Usually I stay home weekends and try to avoid the shore line crowds. But since it was nice I thought ok I'll go give it a try. Saw quit a few folks fishing. Didn't see anyone catch anything at all.  But the fish were hitting.   Look in the sky cause I heard a strange plan engine. And this was what I saw. A fighter plane? It's not even time for the canada airshow yet. Wonder what's up with that? We going to war?   After the plane few by I looked into the water and saw this letter guy. Spawning by him/her self. So thats what it all comes down to huh? Raising kids on your own. Tough job.    After a few fish 3 I left.  dsn
