72695,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-05-17 17:42:00,34,My father purchased a used 17' console fishing boat package.  50hp on the main motor and 15h.p. kicker motor.  I am in heaven! We plan on testing this baby out this week-end for a few hours and wonder where the best place to take it out for a few hours of testing and a few hours of fishing?  I live in Brantford and am willing to travel within an hour or so in any direction.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Side question being this is his first boat... any items or tips on operation or items which should be brought with us on this adventure?  He has a VHF radio and antenna - what channels do I need to know and keep stored for him in case of emergency?  Thanks in advance  Chris

72704,misfish,2007-05-17 17:59:00,29133,Theres a place I hear talked 50 point. I hear you can fish there to.LOL  Enjoy the new toy.
72712,snackpack5150,2007-05-17 18:14:00,79,"Why not head down to long point,I hear the perch are in and some nice sizes are being caught out by EC 10 Buoy.  Good luck  and play save.  Ken"
72715,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-05-17 18:21:00,34,"Erie was my first thought.  I am a little nervous because neither of us have handled a boat in large water or a boat this large as of yet. We plan on doing our boaters exam in the next couple of weeks. I will pick up the book and start reading this week-end.  Thanks again,"
72726,Uncle Buck,2007-05-17 19:32:00,1000,"Bayfront Park in Hamilton...  free launch... nice ramp, plus it's in the harbour, no need to worry about hitting bottom"
72739,pikehunter,2007-05-17 20:24:00,1659,"I agree with uncle Buck, Hamilton Bayfront Park. It is a relatively sheltered area where the ramp is. If you should have an immediate problem then you have no worries. If you venture out into the bay just beware of the wind direction, it can get quite choppy on the open harbour especially if you haven't much experience, you will be OK though in a 17'er but I used to have a 12' boat and it was nasty a couple of times. My 16 handles it better.  2Nd choice would be the Grand River, Dunnville. Launch behind the arena or across the bridge at the Grand Island BBQ both charge a fee. You can put it in on the upper river for free above the dam just before the high school. It is a good launch with a new dock this year, but parking is limited when it's busy.  Have fun and maybe you may even catch some fish"
72740,John,2007-05-17 20:28:00,2956,  Good suggestion for a first trip Buck...
72755,mepps,2007-05-17 21:27:00,1301,I would think aynwhere with water should be good.
72783,Fisherman,2007-05-17 23:02:00,7201,"CH 16 for emergency only, some areas use 68, 71,72 as the "" chatter channels"".  Take a VHF operators course, it's worth the effort for those who have no background in using that type of comms."
72807,JFR,2007-05-18 00:02:00,498," Chris  You will have to comply with Transport Canada requirements for equipment.  Here is a link that will help:  http://www.boatingsafety.gc.ca/  You are required to have a Radio Operators Licence to operate a VHF radio.  Check with your local Power Squadron and find out when the next course is.  You will also require a copy of the boat registration in the boat, ie: the numbers on the side of the boat. (At purchase, you should have received the licence from the seller)  You go to a Service Canada office and change the ownership into your fathers name.  Enjoy your first outing  John"
72836,danbouck,2007-05-18 01:12:00,4380,   Most of long point bay is now a fish sanctuary until opening of bass 
72921,mart,2007-05-18 12:31:00,93,A suggestion for a good spot for your first venture out would be Pittock reservoir in Woodstock. There's panfish/pike/bass inthere too. Very sheltered and safe for your first outing. Here's a link. http://www.thamesriver.on.ca/Parks/Pittock_CA.htm
73213,jjcanoe,2007-05-19 21:04:00,744,I'd also vote for Pittock or Wildwood in St. Mary's.  and you can drop the wife/girlfriend off at the beach there as well.  jjcanoe
