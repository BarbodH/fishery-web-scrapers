I know there is a launch on the north side, though just to be safe, does anyone know the actual directions? I'm assuming the launch is free?  Also, I know its a great Pike lake, though what about the pickeral? Lots of pickeral?Can I jig for whities like they do on Simcoe?  Last question. How far is it from north York?Either kilometers or hours wise.  Oh and does anyone have a map for Chaandos?"

Wally fishing is pretty much dead, I've heard claims that there is to much Lime in the water for them to reproduce, but that is just here say.  The Lake has been getting hit pretty hard in the last three years. I remember the opener five years ago and there was only two trucks at the launch. Now it's packed in comparison. All well, good things never last forever, or is that secrets.  If you still want directions then shoot me a private message and I will get them for you."
