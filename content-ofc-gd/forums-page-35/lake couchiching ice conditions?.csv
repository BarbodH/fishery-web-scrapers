1054049,huzzsaba,2019-12-24 03:51:00,884,Can anyone give an update on Lake Couchiching ice conditions.  I know it freezes before all other lakes in that area.  Thanks
1054058,Terry,2019-12-24 13:59:00,14456,I know lots of people are fishing out from tudhope
1054066,irishfield,2019-12-24 15:51:00,26272,Bring a boat if you want to do Midland Harbour !
1054067,misfish,2019-12-24 15:58:00,29133,I cannot believe I seen sled tracks in that video.
1054068,Terry,2019-12-24 16:00:00,14456,Yup thinking snowdog time. LOL
1054305,David Chong,2019-12-30 21:40:00,836,"Drove through Orillia on the 28th and there were plenty of people out off of Tudhope! With these warm days, I would check the ice carefully if you're heading out! Walk in single file, have a rope that everyone in the group is tied off to, spud as you go & check the ice thickness every so often! If it is a warm day, I would make sure that I do the same coming in as you can lose ice during the day! Be safe out there!"
1054517,Musky Plug,2020-01-03 21:00:00,398,Has anyone been to couch recently? My brother and his buds are heading there tomorrow and I was thinking about joining depending on ice conditions.
1054531,LefroyFisherman,2020-01-04 14:26:00,602,"I wouldn't really think its a great idea, its been fairly warm the past number of days, still open water as far as I can see at Innisfil Beach Rd."
1054540,AKRISONER,2020-01-04 18:48:00,5558,I’m up in point au baril and the ice is a bloody disaster. We are carrying picks and treading lightly and staying within 50 meters of home supposed to get cold tonight and there’s no snow on the ice so much better tomorrow
1054633,Musky Plug,2020-01-06 23:56:00,398,"My Brother ended up going on Sat. Said whole lake was frozen and there was a 4-5"" of ice."
1055409,Shawn W,2020-01-22 12:53:00,5,Can some one update me on the ice conditions at Tudhope Park? Making the run back home from Windsor hoping for some good ice. Also can any one update me on Kempenfelt Bay?
1055410,AKRISONER,2020-01-22 13:10:00,5558,guys are walking on Kempenfelt from bear point towards barrie. between 3.5 and 6 inches of ice. Another mild stretch is about to hit unfortunately.
1055479,Shawn W,2020-01-22 20:31:00,5,Thanks....
1055560,misfish,2020-01-24 00:58:00,29133,"Like said, 3-6 inches reports through out the bay, but snow covered areas have been reported to be 2-3 ""."
1055572,Shawn W,2020-01-24 13:53:00,5,Thank You
1055573,NAW,2020-01-24 14:07:00,4022,"I was out off tudhope on new years day and there was 5"" in our location about 1.5km out.   Past the bouys..  Likely a foot of ice out there now!"
