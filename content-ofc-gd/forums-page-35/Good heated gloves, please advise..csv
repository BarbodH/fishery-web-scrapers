It's bad, I can't even walk more than 100 yards in -1C and have to tap out as my right hand fingers are so cold the tips turn white with good quality work gloves on, not good. I need a recommendation for the very best heated gloves from you ice fishing and outdoorsmen Gurus. Is there such a thing? I have a good budget. I need all my fingers. My Doc gave me a RX. to submit to OHIP or OOS. (Old Age Security) Thank You ahead of time. Johnny D."

1055053,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-16 04:45:00,8243,I don't think anyone is going to pay for a flight up there. I'd probably lose 10 fingers by the time I get into the airport from the DC-3 if there is an airport or it's just an airfield like Sue Aitkens. Poor attempt at comedy not withstanding I would really appreciate a contact if you really recommend them after you get yours. No better a test than where you are where -40 is -40. Thanks Geoff. I'll Google them. I'm sitting here next to the fire and the furnace is set at 70F and my fingers are cold as I type.
1055058,cisco,2020-01-16 10:35:00,597,"Gloves aren't mitts. Mitts is what you need and get em a bit larger to insert chemical hand warmers into. You know, those little packets you shake to activate. Some are duds though so before venturing forth ensure the things are working."

1055084,misfish,2020-01-16 21:31:00,29133,"The warmers now, well most are air activated. No shaking required. Good thing. Nothing like shaking a pack or 2 in the truck and get the look, whats that guy doing in there ? LOL  You want mitts JD.¬† My right pinky gets cold real easy. I put a nail through it in the early 80,s. Ever since then, it gets cold and very painful."
1055087,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-16 21:53:00,8243,"We wore leather mitts and hand warmer pacs¬† when ice fishing and working outdoors occasionally at the plant. Mitts are OK unless you need to use your hands like using a radio outdoors, driving or those time dexterity is required outdoors like using a phone to chopping wood. I need gloves that keep my fingers from freezing. Maybe heated gloves have yet to be developed. There is an opportunity for someone to fill a niche with a new product. Time to Google. Not totally off topic. I knew this nut bar Pipefitter that could only work as far away as the electrical extension cord to the heating pad he wore around his torso. Both indoors and outdoors. I tried it on and It worked. Maybe he wasn't so nuts after all."

The advantage of these under gloves is you can pull the outer gloves off and they are thin enough to do more delicate work. While pricee they are a good answer to your issue. Art

I don't need the dexterity of gloves so I use the handwarmers inside good mitts and no matter how cold it gets my hands are warm and these warmers last 7-8 hours. I use the same mitts I wore when I was working, good quality leather with a fleece lining. https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/grabber-hand-warmers-10-pk-0750057p.html#srp I used to do a LOT of winter biking and wore what they call Lobster Gloves.

1055124,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-17 01:57:00,8243,"Thank you Art et all. This is exactly what I need. It looks like there are more than a few available from 100 CDN and up. More than worth the $$ if they work. Heck I got a 100 dollar gift card from Moore's, got a Tooke and a pair of socks. I don't usually order anything on the interweb thing but Amazon is something I can trust I think. I have read all the comments from buyers and they all seem satisfied. I will let you all know what I buy and how well they work. I just went outside to lift the wipers off the truck and car. They were frozen to the glass so I went back in and got a jug of water. Only took my right glove off long enough to pour the water on them. My fingers on my right hand were burning after less than 60 seconds for Lord's sake. Doc told me to run them under lukewarm water until they stop burning. Geoff, I have a box of gloves and mitts of all construction, styles and makes, so far no good. I always wore the mitts that flip down for fishing and shovelling snow. This year if I expose my right fingers for seconds I'm done and even with the mitt part on if it's below 0C, I'm done. I'm sure these heated gloves will help. Exercise and diet too, I've never been one to work out at home. Just walking is going to help as long as my fingers don't fall off. My wife suggested I walk the track around the new arena in town, great advise, need to take it. The 1st step is the hardest. Thanks again guys. JD"

1055143,AKRISONER,2020-01-17 13:52:00,5558,"sometimes we just get a lil too excited to ice fish ahhahaha I personally use Kast Gear steelhead gloves. They are truly fully waterproof which the seal skins are not. Dexterous enough to fish a baitcaster, spinning reel or fly fish with. Not sure if you are just looking for warm gloves for every day use but when im just trying to keep my hands warm, mitts do the job. Infact when i go late fall boating i wear mitts while driving the boat and then switch to gloves while i fish!"
