1055964,J rock,2020-02-02 21:50:00,7,Hey guys just moved up to north bay and have a small fishing boat lined up for the spring. I’m a rookie fisherman and boater. Just looking for some small quiet lakes to hit a few fish with my son. Thanks guys.

1055972,cisco,2020-02-02 23:09:00,597,"East of NB close to the Q border on the north side is a managed area containing Blue Lake and many others that would be perfect. Perch, lakers, splake, specks, pike and walleye each has a lake or more and even rainbows in one or two lakes. Used to camp at the Blue lake campground and a while ago I heard the whole area is managed by a private contractor with MNR. For sure check it out. Had many a great fish in there! Contact NB MNR to get some info.. Can fish a diff lake for a diff species for several days."
