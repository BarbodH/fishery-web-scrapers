1054675,craigdritchie,2020-01-08 01:49:00,1586,Is it even possible to troll with something like this????   
1054678,John Bacon,2020-01-08 03:50:00,3277,"Run three motors in forward, two in reverse, and turn one off.Â  Should troll nicely.Â  ðŸ˜‰ "
1054682,misfish,2020-01-08 11:13:00,29133,"All these crazy boats these days. They look cool . Maybe it,s do to the size of their Johnson,s?"
1054683,Sandbag,2020-01-08 11:48:00,533,"The four motors on the corners look like they are mounted on an angle and would be propelling the boat on an angle.Â  i guess if all the motors are synchronized perfectly it may be a non-issue, but if not I think it would be a job to keep it straight.  Sure looks cool though!"
1054684,Yellow Fever,2020-01-08 12:00:00,139,Clearly a case of to much money. ...
1054694,mamona,2020-01-08 15:01:00,597,"You are jealous, me too."
1054697,Headhunter,2020-01-08 16:17:00,5703,"Once the parachute is deployed, I bet that baby trolls down pretty good! HH"
1054701,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-08 18:11:00,10439,They are electrically steered. There is a joystick for docking purposes. It will steer the engines in different directions in order to slip sideways into its spot. Very cool system that most of the big OB manufacturers offer. While underway they are steered the usual way with the steering wheel.
1054702,AKRISONER,2020-01-08 18:25:00,5558,these guys make me laugh. I recently saw one of the monstrosities posted on my local marina's for sale page. They had some boat with 1400 horses in outboards strapped to it. I asked its top speed and they said 70mph...A stock bass boat with a 250 will pass the damn thing. This is the equivalent of throwing the bugattis quad turbo W 12 engine on a chrysler 300. Just stupid.
1054889,muskybw,2020-01-12 15:14:00,116,IT would look real good on HEAD LAKE in Haliburton with the MAYOR Alex of Eagle Lake on the bow waving ? LOL.
1055920,Crimsongulf,2020-02-01 23:12:00,294,"I know it is a totally different world, but down here on the Gulf you would troll artificial lures for Mahi Mahi at 6-12 knots."
1055922,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-01 23:20:00,8243,!st I wonder if everything I see on the interweb is true? If true how many barrels of oil to the mile? Another case of far too much $$$.
