1056096,ketchenany,2020-02-06 01:46:00,3229,Reading  the headline I thought a skating rink!  Ice fishing with a truck? Mr B says it all.
1056101,irishfield,2020-02-06 02:59:00,26272,"I wouldn't even drive a Civic out to my dock on Temagami tomorrow, when many years I've had fully loaded truck and 20' enclosed trailer sitting beside it on New Years Eve. No way I'd be driving a truck on Simcoe this year."
1056102,porkpie,2020-02-06 03:34:00,2521,Yeah don’t be doing that.  I’ve been out on Simcoe a bit this winter and the ice is sporadic and varying.  It’s just recently become pretty good for machine travel I sure wouldn’t take my truck out.
1056103,Fisherman,2020-02-06 03:40:00,7201,"hope the snow stays south of the lake, no insulating what little ice there is."
1056116,Sinker,2020-02-06 14:24:00,8692,"I've travelled the main lake of simcoe the last 2 days. She's pretty solid, and consistent as far as I saw. I didn't see any less than 9"", and saw some spots with 15"". Do NOT  drive a truck out there.  S."
