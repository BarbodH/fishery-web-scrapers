1055588,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-24 20:00:00,8243,Many things have changed since you took your hiatus Roy. Some members can't even discuss hockey without going off the rails and getting personal. Art has been doing a great job in your absence.

1055625,HTHM,2020-01-25 17:49:00,4082,Welcome back Roy. If you happen to pull my name donate the baits to a deserving youth organization instead of sending them to me.

I've been scanning the board the last two days or so. The last thread I read was the walleye comb-over and I was going to make J an attractive supper but I'm going with rainbow filets and I don't know anyone important that¬†¬†thin. Looking forward to hearing from you guys. On Saturday, the 25th at 8 pm, I'll draw a name of a person who posted to this thread and send that person a batch of walleye baits. It really IS great to be back."
