We have hundreds maybe thousands of these typr of small craft Marinas in Ontario. The boats are jammed together so tightly fire jumps from vessel to vessel well, like wildfire. Cruisers, cuddy's and house boats have 1 way in and 1 way out in most cases. It makes me think about several friends that basically live on their boats all summer. If you overnight on your boat do you have a fire escape plan? https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/28/alabama-boat-fire-dock-cleanup-scottsboro-marina-underway/4596284002/"

I'm surprised that I haven't seen any out of their slips.. only commercial crafts are moving around..

Escaping flames on some large boats must be a problem,  smaller windows and doorways for example. Very sad for the families indeed."
