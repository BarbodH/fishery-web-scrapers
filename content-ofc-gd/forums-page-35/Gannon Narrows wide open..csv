1055111,captpierre,2020-01-16 23:28:00,2521,Pigeon Lake frozen. Water levels about 2 ft higher than normal for this time of year. Â No doubt from the recent rain. Â Cold weather coming. ðŸ¥¶
1055112,captpierre,2020-01-16 23:34:00,2521,Just checked TSW site. Levels almost 3 ft higher than average for this time of year on Pigeon/Buckhorn Lakes. ðŸ˜²
1055114,moxie,2020-01-16 23:50:00,1566,Ya but with little to no snow pack on the ground and less than normal depth of frost in the groundÂ  this spring should be much different than last.
1055169,lew,2020-01-17 18:55:00,12766,I went for a 90 minute hike along the OtonabeeÂ River near Trent University this morning and the water is flowing unbelievably fast and much higher than a week ago. I crossed the dam at Nassau Mills Rd. and they have all 7 gates open letting water through. Looked more like the spring runoff in April rather than mid January.
1055181,Sinker,2020-01-17 21:43:00,8692,Winter has just begun.Its not over yet. Lots can happen between now and april. 
1055583,buckhorn250,2020-01-24 18:41:00,85,"Water levels are definitely higher then normal...not sure if as high as folks are saying ...Just grabbed todays waterlevel results for Buckhorn...Â  .293 meters above average...it has been dropping over the last couple of days, but more rain coming tonight.  "
1055585,lew,2020-01-24 18:48:00,12766,"Forecast for this area is also calling for 6-8"" of snow tomorrow and another couple inches on Sunday"
1055587,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-24 19:55:00,8243,"I love the optimism and dedication you ice guys have. I met a couple from Barrie last year in The Dominican Republic. His wife said ""He's looks so miserable because he thinks he should be icefishing."""
1055796,KawarthaAngler,2020-01-29 13:29:00,273,"I live on Upper Buckhorn and haven't noticed any fluctuations in the water level.Â  After big rains in winter ... certainly stronger current through bottlenecks such as Gannon Narrows, but that's all I've noticed.Â  Maybe I need to be more observant.Â  :)"
1055798,buckhorn250,2020-01-29 14:24:00,85,"Hey KawarthaAngler, Im also on Upper Buckhorn ( in the Kawartha Hideaway back bay area) and I have found it really tough to tell where the levels are. I'vebeen watching the Trent Waterway site which says that as of today we are 13 inches above average levels (included below), but it really didn't feel that much higher. Then my neighbour showed me some older photos of his dock...were definitely a foot above normal. 246.34     "
1055838,KawarthaAngler,2020-01-30 14:40:00,273,"The ice at my dock looks at normal levels for this time of year.Â  But yesterday when I looked to an open water spotÂ against shore/docks where I'm familiar with the water height ... YES, I then sawÂ it is high. I've always thought of installing some time of measuring device at my dock ... just to observe out of curiosity."
