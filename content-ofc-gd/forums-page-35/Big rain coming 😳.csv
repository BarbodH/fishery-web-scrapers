1055122,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-17 01:43:00,10439,My favorite run was the Glades. Loved moguls in between trees.¬†üòÅ One of my buddies that I skied with was on the Canadian freestyle team. He could ski the Wall like it was the bunny run. Dude was amazing.
1055127,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-17 02:42:00,8243,"I was never a mogul guy. There was mogul hill at Chedoke Golf course in Hamilton. To me it looked like skiing down the side of a wall. The 1st time I ran it I tore a knee cartilage that took me out all winter. The next year somehow the handle of my pole hit me square in the jaw and I broke it, my jaw not the pole. That took me out of my Sr. year of Basketball and skiing that winter. I know when to pack something in. If I had gone to shorter skis I'm sure it would have turned out better. I think I was running on 195 CM K2's. Pretty long. What did I know at 17, not much and a zero budget to buy shorter skis."
1055139,AKRISONER,2020-01-17 13:25:00,5558,"If people knew the actual stats on how many people die on ski resorts each year, the bubble people probably wouldnt ski  In Ontario its crashing and smackin your head that will get you, but its a regular thing out west for people to found dead stuck in tree wells etc etc. The resorts keep the details very tight lipped obviously due to the PR. I know for a fact during my years snowboarding on three separate occasions people have died on the hill while ive been snowboarding. When you think about it ive probably only snowboarded a few hundred days in my life meaning that the ratio is incredibly bad!"
1055140,SirCranksalot,2020-01-17 13:29:00,3291,Blue Mtn certainly has it's share of deaths and serious injuries.
1055144,LostAnotherOne,2020-01-17 14:41:00,956,Last time I was there I fell forward and slided on probably 20 feet on ice.¬† Chest was scraped up pretty good.¬† I knew it was going to be a bad one so I lifted my head and legs up in the air as I glided smoothly over the ice lol.¬† Planning on going again this year and will definitely be wearing a helmet.
1054867,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-11 20:03:00,10439,I've heard conflicting stories whether they are putting it in or not this year. Luckily I don't have a ton of stuff to haul out so it won't be terrible if it doesn't go in.

1054892,captpierre,2020-01-12 17:36:00,2521,"About 70-80 mm of rain here in Stouffville. Grateful that we didn‚Äôt lose power. Lots of sump pumps working hard. ¬†Cold temps this morning will diminish flooding. Dodged a bullet, me thinks."
1054893,lew,2020-01-12 17:53:00,12766,My sump usually only comes on in the spring with the big melt but it's running pretty good today. After the downpour finished last evening¬† we got an inch of snow then more rain then it all froze together and now it's like hard packed sugar and very tough to shovel. I've always said once winter starts it'd be better if it stayed below freezing till springtime and do away with all these crazy melt/freeze cycles.
1054895,Fisherman,2020-01-12 18:18:00,7201,"We have that same 1 inch of frozen sugar snow with another 3-4 inches of fluff on top.¬† Snowblower just rides on top.¬† Time to spread the salt.¬† I'm amazed that for the amount of rain we got here the sump pump hole is pretty much empty,¬† the ground isn't frozen yet and must have absorbed the brunt of it."

It was froze over on Thursday . This morning all the new ice was pushed to the south shore by the north winds, but new ice has started again on the north side. Starting over.

1054978,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-14 04:54:00,8243,"I once spent 2 weeks in Oulu Finland, 45 K's south of the Artic Circle. I didn't check the weather every morning because -36C feels like -360, I couldn't tell the difference between -36 and the real cold days of -56. Hell shouldn't be fire and brimstone it should be -36C. Heat I can take, those temps are just stupid. No wonder most of you guys, not you, most are hammered drunk. I know most in Oulu Finland are. The 1st move after a shift in the plant there is to shower, have a sauna, shower and then have a shot of Vodka. Almost frozen Vodka no less with a splash of Tar in the shot. Not Tar from a tree Tar from dead Dinosaurs. Brain freeze. Maybe that's how the Finns can mine 24/7/12. The Grand River is swollen to the roads here from Caledonia to Lake Erie. Thankfully we don't have ice down stream, those homes would be under water."

I had lunch today in Hammertown with a good buddy that had a snow plow biz, his son in law runs it now but he still plows. I don't know where they get their info but he said Hamilton is getting 20 centimeters of snow this weekend. My weather thing says 20% chance of snow Sunday with temps at +5. That's tricky. He is usually right, but only when it comes to snow."

1055052,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-16 04:35:00,8243,"Arctic Angler. I need to get a new weather network. Obviously the one I use is not as good as the predictions I have no idea how many miles NW of us here. Thank you. The next time I need to know if I should wear a coat or a jacket or just stay in and finish reading ""The Irishman"". I'll PM you big guy. Thanks, Johnny D. PS I hope the movie is better than the book, not impressed. Not many admit to crimes in an auto biography, especially murder where there isn't a statute of limitations. Now that the protagonist is dead I'm sure Scorsese took artistic license and I'm sure has ""The Irishman"" Frank Sheeran played by Robert DeNero pulling a trigger."

There is an entire generation born in the 90's who's lives will be forever cynical from the point they learn this on.
1055104,misfish,2020-01-16 22:48:00,29133,"LMAO  Today started off mild -6, then it started to drop like a stone by 4pm. Gusty N/W winds are keeping the snow off the bay here . Seen a large blue pool out in the middle, but with temps dropping to -26 over night, that will tighten up quick. Hope that snow fall called for, stays south of 89.

1055108,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-16 23:01:00,8243,Looking south across Lake Erie this afternoon the US side of the lake was getting hammered with snow. I'm sure they didn't mind as this area is called The Southern Tier of Western NY and that is where all the ski resorts are that I actually skied when I was a yunggin'. I have grainy color pics to prove it too! Ski pants came in Bell Bottoms then. Thanks Drifter. I'll check it out. Our Weather Channel here in Haldimand still say 20% chance of precip. +6C.
1055109,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-16 23:04:00,10439,I used to ski Holiday Valley every weekend back when I was a youngun'.
1055121,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-17 01:26:00,8243,"I liked Holiday Valley much better than Kissing Bridge Drifter. It had that big long run that ran the backside of the hills, not steep but a long enough run your legs were on fire at the end. I ended up in the creek on the left side when I thought I was Hans Klammer when we did our imitation of a Downhill race. It was nothing for us to drive to Blue Mountain on a Friday after work and if we found poor conditions like rain we would turn around and drive back south, spend the night at home then drive to Holiday Valley just in time for the Sun to rise. The 1st time we went to Banff only then did we find out what a real deal ski run was. Vermont and Quebec couldn't hold a candle to those runs out west. Holiday Valley now has a championship 18 hole golf course on it with condos on the sides of the fairways. Double as ski to and from Ski Chalet's in winter, not this winter unless it's been all man made up to today. Heck here's another crazy and unsafe thing we do like ice fishin', downhill skiing. I bet more crazy people die downhill skiing than drown ice fishing. I will add playing hockey and football to that list of possible quadriplegic activities.¬† Hell, I think it's more hazardous tobogganing down hills surrounded by big trees than ice fishing is. It's sad to think of all the people that will never leave their rooms because it might hurt."
