1053796,Headhunter,2019-12-16 16:46:00,5703,I did mine on their phone system as I was not able to get the online thingy to work. It arrived within a week! HH
1053846,Garnet,2019-12-18 13:59:00,2056,Well I won't be fishing illegal Jan 2. Got my card yesterday.
1053869,Cando,2019-12-18 23:02:00,90,Glad I don't have to worry about forgetting to renew.¬† I use my disabled parking permit as my fishing licence.
1053870,Old Man,2019-12-19 00:00:00,822,Took less than two weeks for mine to show up in the mail. I was surprised. 
1054310,David Chong,2019-12-30 21:51:00,836,Renewed mine earlier this month! My Outdoor card arrived in about 8 days!
1054311,Fisherman,2019-12-31 00:33:00,7201,"The way this weather is going, it's going to be a while before I feel comfortable on the ice and need an outdoors cardüôÅ"
1054312,misfish,2019-12-31 00:38:00,29133,"Hows your parking spot ""spot """
1054313,Fisherman,2019-12-31 01:02:00,7201,"Well, it's definitely not snow covered, lol."
1055549,misfish,2020-01-23 22:16:00,29133,Well I bought mine Dec 28th CTC north Barrie. Still no card received yet. WTH
1055562,Fisherman,2020-01-24 01:01:00,7201,For service call 1-800- WTH- MyCard.
1055564,irishfield,2020-01-24 01:16:00,26272,Call the CTC store.. bet they never sent the thing in...
1055565,misfish,2020-01-24 01:22:00,29133, Atleast I have the printed off version.
1055637,akaShag,2020-01-25 21:57:00,2073,"You DO know that you don't need a fishing licence, right? Doug"
1055646,Fisherman,2020-01-25 22:55:00,7201,"Yes, but I keep my hunting licence, I've had the blue crankyback sticker too for the truck and car."
1053427,G.mech,2019-12-05 00:10:00,830,You can argue with the JoP if you want but it's pretty clear you are required to carry the card so I'm going to avoid the hassle in the future https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-outdoors-card#section-0  https://www.ontario.ca/document/ontario-fishing-regulations-summary/recreational-fishing-licence-information
1053428,Bernie,2019-12-05 00:21:00,3190,At age 65 a person no longer requires a fishing licence. Is it determined after that age a sport or conservation? 
1053430,Terry,2019-12-05 00:35:00,14456,Sport.
1053431,Bernie,2019-12-05 00:47:00,3190,Thanks Terry! 
1053450,Garnet,2019-12-05 16:13:00,2056,I agree just care your licence at all times. Still have pic in my phone.
1053466,Sinker,2019-12-05 21:03:00,8692,"I've experienced both extremes. Once forgot my wallet with my license in it, and the CO said no worries, i will call it in. Great experience, nice guy! I didn't realize I'd forgotten it until I'd ordered my breaky at the timmys drive thru....lol Then last year on the ice, I had the digital copy on my phone, but my phone died, so when he showed up to check, I had no proof of a license. He would not call it in. Said if I didn't show proof, I was getting a $244 fine.¬† He was being a total jerk about it, and I called him out on it, but no way was he calling anything in. He was with 2 more CO's and 2 cops. I logged into my email from¬† Loris phone and all was good. I saves a lot of Bull by just having a hard copy, and your card on you all the time. My card is good for another year, but i will need new hunting/fishing licenses for 2020.  S."
1053476,Garnet,2019-12-06 12:08:00,2056,If my card and 3 year isn't here by J1 I'm still going fishing. I have done my part. Dec 3 the first available I bought and paid for¬†licence. If I get caught I will start with Justice of Piece. Like I said CO can lay any charge.
1053478,G.mech,2019-12-06 13:10:00,830,"Or, if you really wanted to, you could print the license summary and carry that until your new card comes like you're supposed to but you seem to prefer the JOP option so fill yer boots."
1053497,Garnet,2019-12-06 20:42:00,2056,Of course I will have my email and my credit card bill. The CO can still lay a charge. Waste of paper but they can.
1053499,misfish,2019-12-06 22:37:00,29133,"I checked my yellow paper tags. One is for my lic,one is for my sport and the 3rd one is my temporary outdoors card.¬† So I guess I am covered. New card required next year, so I guess I will get a hard card next year.  This mixed up weather is not getting me excited to be in a rush anyways.LOL"
1053625,phin#9,2019-12-11 22:57:00,13,What happens if you turn 65 in the summer. Do you still have to purchase cards for the six month period Im still 64?
1053626,irishfield,2019-12-11 23:15:00,26272,..or don't fish until your Birthday! 
1053627,Terry,2019-12-11 23:20:00,14456,Yes you need to buy a license and card for the year you turn 65
1053645,irishfield,2019-12-12 17:02:00,26272,"Certainly can't complain this year. Already have the wife's new 3 year card and fishing licence in my hands, fresh out of the mail box. First day I've grabbed the mail this week, could have been there for 4 days and I bought it late night on the 3rd."
1053646,Terry,2019-12-12 17:14:00,14456,Yup did my outdoors card online dec3 and showed up yesterday in my mail box life is good. ¬†Lol
1053647,Fisherman,2019-12-12 17:35:00,7201,"Looks like the outdoors card machine is working well, got mine today too."
1053653,irishfield,2019-12-12 22:12:00,26272,So you still have to have a card when you get old?? Not just a birth certificate?
1053656,Terry,2019-12-12 22:16:00,14456,I need the outdoors card for hunting. Not fishing but it has my name and age so it should work as proof of age
1053660,misfish,2019-12-13 00:18:00,29133,"Just one look at him Wayne, and they will know he is old."
1053662,Terry,2019-12-13 00:23:00,14456,Have you been told today yes you have
1053663,misfish,2019-12-13 00:45:00,29133,get in line lol
1053666,Fisherman,2019-12-13 01:43:00,7201,"Uh oh, lack of mirrors and dissention in the ranks. ü§£"
1053692,DanD,2019-12-13 22:33:00,2223,I ordered my licence the same day (hour) that Fisherman started this thread.¬† 	it was in the mail box tonight when I got home tonight. 10 days to process and delivered. Truly amazing for a ¬†government agency? Dan. 	Thanks again Fisherman for the reminder. 
1053707,Fisherman,2019-12-14 01:17:00,7201,"Hahaha, I keep looking over my should wondering what's going to go wrong."
1053790,mamona,2019-12-16 15:10:00,597,Now I am jelous.
1053364,Fisherman,2019-12-03 14:15:00,7201,"It's that time of year,¬† don't get caught without the 2020+ version.¬† Completed my renewal on line a few minutes ago."
1053367,GBW,2019-12-03 14:32:00,8460,I'm good till 2021 but thanks for the reminder for me to go check my card.
1053368,mamona,2019-12-03 14:32:00,597,I still haven't received my 2019 (ordered last December). Don't they use plastics anymore?
1053369,Fisherman,2019-12-03 14:36:00,7201,Not 100% sure but heard that it will now be a paper outdoor card that you print.
1053373,GBW,2019-12-03 14:49:00,8460,"Odd, I ordered mine last year (a 3-year) and got a new plastic card at the start of 2019."
1053375,irishfield,2019-12-03 15:04:00,26272,"3 years at a time, you get a card. Reminds me, need to renew the wife's...  Got a website link??"
1053376,GBW,2019-12-03 15:10:00,8460,https://www.ontario.ca/page/fishing-licence-fees-ontario-residents
1053377,TennesseeGuy,2019-12-03 15:12:00,957,Printing the card works for me.¬† ¬†1 in my tackle bag.¬† ¬†1 in glove box of truck.¬† ¬†1 in my billfold.
1053378,mamona,2019-12-03 16:02:00,597,This is exactly what I did 
1053379,Terry,2019-12-03 16:26:00,14456,I don‚Äôt think I will buy one anymore
1053381,misfish,2019-12-03 16:35:00,29133,YUP. You can always tell the CO. I never catch fish anyways. ü§£
1053382,misfish,2019-12-03 16:37:00,29133,"I have one in each fishing pack, in my toon,on my cell, in my jacket,in my hut,in my floater suit.¬† Am I missing a spot ?"
1053385,Headhunter,2019-12-03 18:18:00,5703,"Perhaps one spot Brian, but I suspect that no one would want anything to do with it, if you kept it there!üòÄ HH "
1053386,Fisherman,2019-12-03 18:53:00,7201,"One other thing, why don't they go on a 5 year system like health cards and driver licence, it would cut down the massive cluster at the end of the year."
1053387,Headhunter,2019-12-03 18:56:00,5703,Because they don't intend to wait 5 years for an opportunity to raise the fee! HH
1053388,dave524,2019-12-03 20:09:00,4508,I'm not buying one either 
1053393,BillM,2019-12-03 23:27:00,17367,"Thanks for the heads up, gotta check!¬† I think it's renewal time."
1053394,LeXXington,2019-12-03 23:38:00,1928,"So, I can't remember where I saw it but CO's were giving fines for not having the Outdoor Cards.¬†¬† I can't remember if this was resolved yet. Early on people thought oh just carry the paper but then when stopped they did not have the card. From the https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-outdoors-card It stills states: you must carry your Outdoors Card when hunting or fishing, unless you have just recently purchased the card and not yet received it in the mail. In this case, you must have a copy of your License Summary available. An Outdoors Card is a plastic, wallet-sized identification card issued by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry that allows you to hunt or fish. You are required to carry this card with you at all times while hunting or fishing."
1053398,misfish,2019-12-04 00:21:00,29133,"If this is the case, they best start doing their job on getting the cards out timely. I had to buy a new card last year. I have yet to receive a new replacement.¬† My fault?¬† Do not think so. I have my receipt and printed off yellow tags."
1053401,DRIFTER_016,2019-12-04 02:19:00,10439,Ours don't expire until the end of March here in the NWT. 
1053408,Garnet,2019-12-04 11:39:00,2056,I have pic of my card on my phone.
1053409,DanD,2019-12-04 12:00:00,2223,Thank you! I wouldn't have thought of it. Dan.
1053413,G.mech,2019-12-04 13:18:00,830,"CO told me that was no good last year. You have to carry the card but you can use an electronic version of your license, tag, or license summary.¬† I actually thought he was going to give me a ticket but my charming personality must have won him over."
1053414,bobowski,2019-12-04 13:50:00,360,Last year on trout opener a CO standing on the other side of the stream let me text a pic of my licence to him so he could verify. Also had to cast my bait across the water to him so he could make sure I was fishing barbless.
1053415,Garnet,2019-12-04 14:27:00,2056,The first thing is I have something to talk about a CO can write any ticket they want. I would visit justice of peace and have ticket thrown out. If CO had to many tickets thrown out the boss would notice.
