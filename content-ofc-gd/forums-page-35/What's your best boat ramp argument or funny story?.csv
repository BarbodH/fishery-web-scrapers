SMOKE SHOW  Not boat related at all, but a hilarious quip from my old car club. I still dont know if it actually happened, but it was a hilarious thought anyways. Back when emmisions tests required your car to be hooked up to the government's scam machine, one of the members took a bet from a few guys that he wouldnt load his car full of seafoam before taking the E test. He apparently clouded out the entire shop ahhaha."

1055710,LeXXington,2020-01-26 23:06:00,1928,other than my own mishap.. that shall remain legendary. I watched a couple of very drunk boaters pull there very nice big speed boat up the ramp super fast get near the top of the ramp... then the fun begins. trailer pops off the ball... No safety chains.. Down the ramp this boat goes dragging all the way and into the water. with the momentum out it goes away from the dock well out of reach.    OPP boat arrives to help.. We did not see the end results
1055756,Headhunter,2020-01-28 14:56:00,5703,"I've told this story before, but it's been awhile so... Fished Quinte a ton back in the 90's, mostly from November until ice up. We arrived early, in the dark and proceeded to the launch in Picton. Temps were somewhere south of minus 10C. Back the boat down the launch, me holding the rope. Trailer is all the way in the water, but the boat looks wrong in the water. The trailer is frozen to the boat! Just hanging there. the thinking at the time, let's just let it come off in the water. Fifteen minutes later, no luck. We pull the boat out, still on the trailer and make a run to the power-wash car wash in Picton, and hit the bunks with the hot water, race back to the launch and the boat floats off the bunks. HH"
1055767,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-28 22:39:00,8243,"We were late one year doing test runs. We like going out in 2 boats in case one needs a tow. The problem it was a Sunday on the Grand south of Dunnville. I do not use the boat on weekends, too many ramp follies. So I'm lined up 5 boats ahead of me. 2 guys in a 14' tinny pass me and all the other boats and cuts in. Everyone's yelling at them, they don't bat an eye. The one guy gets out and goes and gets his mini van. He can not back the van in straight, more than a 1/2 dozen tries. My buddy is already out and has my truck and trailer standing by so I can drive onto the trailer. The guy  is hammering the trailer into the dock, time after time. Ted  offers to back the truck up for him, no speak English. This time he scrapes the side of the van against the dock, not a nice sound for the owner. Now everybody he cut is applauding everytime he scrapes his trailer and van against the dock, with great glee they cheered. Finally the trailer is in the water straight but not far enough in, everyones telling him to back up more, no speak English. The 2 guys get into the water waist deep and struggle to get the boat on the trailer. There isn't enough water under the trailer so they are trying to lift it on. After great effort the trailer is under the boat. They pull up the ramp a bit and stop. Now they are going to do everything they can do hundreds of feet away but no they are going to unload the boat and put everything in the van 1st. There's 6 boats behind me know. That enough of this non sense and now there is an angry mob. The  guy that was next in line jumps onto the dock and screams something at these idiots, jumps into the van and pulls it away from the ramp at the cheers of the angry mob. How these 2 duffuses didn't et punched in the face I have no idea. I do not like boating on weekends."
1055768,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-28 22:59:00,10439,"I once watched a guy pull a 33' Chris Craft out at Port Credit. Only issue is he didn't use the ramp, he used the rocks just to the West of the opening to the river. He was coming back from Rochester NY. He was passed out drunk and on auto pilot. It happened during the salmon derby and there were dozens of people fishing off the rocks that had run for their lives. The dude lived, the boat was toast!!! The deck was no longer attached to the hull. Dude was arrested and charged with DUI. The boat ended up past the rocks and up on the grass."
1055793,bucktail,2020-01-29 13:06:00,1857,"My story happened about 20 years ago at the Bronte ramp. An older father and son were about to launch there boat and the old man was behind directing the son backwards. It appeared the son hit the gas instead of the brake because the old van proceed to fly into the water up to the front door! That wasn't the worst part of it, he managed to run over the old man!!!!  I was way down the road and people ran to help but they had to call an ambulance and a tow truck at the same time!"

1027801,AKRISONER,2018-05-03 14:11:00,5558,"LMAOOO stolen from another forum posted today ahahha  Its been over a week so I have recovered and can talk about it without feeling the pain. So I am taking out on a small 1 lane ramp in South Florida last week. I arrive at the ramp and two guys have sunk their 15 to 17 fiberglass boat with roughly a 25 hp motor on it. Motor looks relatively new and is totally under water. So I don't have much choice but to help them. Looks like a 85 year old guy and son if I was guessing. Said they forgot to put drain plug in.  So we are waist deep in gator water trying to get the nose of the boat on the end of the trailer. I ask the older guy to back the trailer in a bit deeper. He starts to pull out I'm screaming stop when the entire trailer comes loose from the hitch. They did not latch the hitch closed. After 45min of straining, we get enough water out of the boat where the bilge gives us some help and we got drain plug in. By this time the 85 year old has told me he is 92 can't hear, can't feel his feet and does not drive well. I relieved him from duty and pulled out. As I got out of car, I see water pouring from the side of the boat. 4 inch hole in the boat. Apparently glue did not repair the hole Now I see how the boat sunk so quickly.  In the process of getting the boat Out, I got their life jackets out and used them to help float the backend of the boat. They were hard for me to get out. Both of these guys may have drowned had they gotten out on the lake before the boat sunk.   They thanked me and said it was the maiden voyage. I hurt for 4 days from all the lifting. I won't soon forget them drivng off with water still pouring out port side. I kid you not, anything can happen in Florida; and does."
1027804,Sterling,2018-05-03 15:23:00,477,"Man, what a great thread. I once ""launched"" a 16ft aluminum on a steep, muddy ""ramp"". It was so steep and I got greedy by untying EVERYTHING before touching water. The boat came off the bunks, slid off the trailer and 15ft down to shore. So we just pushed the thing into the water. It was a beater and the motor wasn't damaged so we had a good laugh. Those of you familiar with the Trout Lake launch in North Bay may know it was roped off for a while (if not STILL roped off). I'm the guy who ""discovered"" the cement slabs falling off into the deep. Almost sent my entire rig into the lake that day. Luckily there was a group of 20 drunken college kids nearby. They helped me literally lift the entire thing out of the water. Gave them whatever beer I had on hand. I wouldn't be needing it that day.... Third story, launching my 17.5ft crestliner with brother-in-law's $80,000 pickup. We're 10ft from the shoreline getting the boat ready and the whole thing starts moving backward. He had left it in DRIVE. He managed to get into the truck and hit the brakes just on time. He had some serious momentum going too. Good thing it was a dry launch."

The ferry launch is not available as the snow plow has filled it in. We hit the marina on the south shore near the ferry. The pic is what we found there upon arrival. Two of us spent two hours clearing the ice off the ramp with shovels. That's dedication! To make matters worse, I think we only got one fish for the rest of the day! HH "

1048225,hutch4113,2019-08-08 15:18:00,374,"I am used to the proper IN/OUT rules at a boat launch - so the Tiffin Launch in Barrie always drives me crazy.  I hate it when people dock at the launch, and then go get their vehicle - which is now behind the line up of those wanting to launch - but of course their boat is blocking access. Now in fairness - the design of that launch is horrible - and docking off to the side is not always available. Having said that, my story was a late evening.  There were about 4 boats ahead of me waiting to be pulled out.  So I docked at the side, and waited.  About 30 minutes later, I see two boats roaring down the bay, and said to my wife, just you watch - they are going to dock at the launch.  It was my turn coming up so got the truck in the lane - and when ready backed it in.  As I got out, the wife in one of the boats (who are now parked/blocking the launch ramp) said ""Excuse me - but we need to pull our boats out"".  I said I had been here for 30 minutes already - pointed to my boat and proceeded to walk away. Pulled the boat over to load (it drives on real nice) and they were still sitting in my way.  I just sat there waiting - until they finally clued in and moved.  I was in/out in under a minute. Launched at Innisfil the other day (what a much better system - and they even had Police there, I guess because they knew it would be busy) and have always seen a large line up of people standing at the railing.  I figured they were watching people, but was not 100% sure.  Anyway after launching a Lady remarks to me - well that was no fun - where was the Drama ?.   So confirmed what I thought - they go there to watch the often highly rated Gong Show."

1048228,Woodsman,2019-08-08 17:44:00,1286,"A couple of years ago at Port Bruce we came in due to it getting far too rough. As we loaded up the boat we seen a guy with a 1960's fiberglass boat (aprox 16')with an inboard/outboard getting ready to launch. We warned him not to go. His response was ""I was out earlier & I know what I'm doing"". Even the ramp owner told him ""If these guys are telling you not to go don't as they go out when most won't"". They launched. After getting packed up we were having a beer with the ramp owner when they came back with the husband cursing at the wife. When they got to the mouth they found out they couldn't handle the 5 footers and tried to turn back getting washed into the pier and damaging the outdrive. But it was her fault?????? "

1048233,grimsbylander,2019-08-08 21:37:00,3016,I was at Midland launch one day and watched a guy with his new 17’ fibreglass boat preparing for the first launch. Unfortunately he didn’t do much homework prior to heading to the lake. He’s parked at the top of the ramp with the transom about 20’ from the waters edge and he’s figuring out the winch. You boys know what’s next...he flips the directional switch and away she goes!!!! The damn handle was spinning so fast it sounded like a helicopter. The boats transom hits the concrete and just keeps on going. When the handle finally stopped spinning there was a 20’ white racing strip down the middle of the ramp. Those ramps that get raked while the concrete is wet sure make launching easier but they also grind a boats keel down to the glass fibre in no time. I felt bad for the poor guy. Know your trailer!!
1048234,BillM,2019-08-08 21:45:00,17367,"That's brutal, but hilarious at the same time, lol!"
1048260,AKRISONER,2019-08-09 19:43:00,5558,"jeeez grimsby, how did he get the boat back on the trailer? did you stick around to watch lol? ive forgotten the plug out too many times to count, but thats probably because i rarely launch at busy public launches. When i do I go full OCD and check the boat over 5 times to make sure everything is set before I put the boat in. Luckily, I can reach my plug by reaching over the back of the boat. Im not too proud to say that I havent done that a couple of times as well Not so ""funny per-se"" but just an example at the ridiculousness of public launches, the Chemong causeway launch has one dock that has enough room for a boat on each side. 3 weeks ago I was coming in after spending the day out on the lake and another young guy was parked on the outside of the dock so I sit out in the water waiting for the spot to open up so that i can tie off and go get the truck to pull out. Another family is launching their bowrider as this is happening, a group of about 6+ kids and dog etc. Young guy hops back in his boat after parking his truck and takes off and I pull in and park my boat at the outside of the dock. There is a line up of cars waiting to launch. The lady looks at me as im pulling up and parking my boat on the outside of the dock ""but we were going to use that side of the dock"" she says accusingly as if I stole it. I simply ignore her and go to get my truck, as I watch her friends and family begin to load the boat with their supplies for the day parked blocking the launch so that no one else can launch. They then sat there for 5 minutes waiting for their friends to be ready so that they could leave. I guess I was supposed to just sit out in the bay until all of the boats had stopped launching that day ? Its funny, people seem to notice when you actually prepare your boat ahead of time for launching. Mutitple times people have commented ""youve done this a few times eh?"" just because I get the boat ready before I hit the ramp. I guess common sense isnt common"
1048266,BillM,2019-08-09 21:51:00,17367,Biggest pet peeve are people loading/unloading the boat while it's on the ramp.   Can't handle it.
1048280,AKRISONER,2019-08-10 12:47:00,5558,"the problem is that the people are so ignorant that she thought it was my fault that they were in the way because their plan was to use the side of the dock for the people coming in off of the water. I had already waited 5 minutes floating out in the lake for the other side of the dock to open up, I guess whats another 20 minutes?"
1048282,BillM,2019-08-10 14:36:00,17367,"If you've ever launched at Village Marine in HH, you'll know it's a bit tight.   I was just pulling the boat out when a lady parks her Toyota right in the middle of the lane to unload her boat that's at the dock.  I was assuming she'd see me and back up, or actually use a parking spot to load/offload all her crap.   So I gave her one trip to the boat to come back with handfuls of stuff before I asked her to move.  She had no idea..  I was there, idling with the boat half out of the water just staring at her.    I couldn't do anything but shake my head."

Idiots!! I got sick of it and because I can completely unhook my boat from the trailer before backing down, told my friend to hang on we’re going down the middle!!

They thought for sure that they could untie to boat, gun the truck and the boat would just slide back into the water. After laughing for a bit we took about 6 of us and helped them bring the boat out to the water. Last laugh was on me though.

Thankfully (?) the lower unit was down and the aluminum skeg stopped the entire boat from dropping off the trailer. It rolled back about 8-10', a group of us were able to push it back on.

Pull the boat out, drive over to the power wash stall on the strip in Picton and hammer the bunks with hot water for 15 minutes. Drive like crazy back to the launch, back the boat down and she lifts off the trailer! A fishing we will go! HH"
1027671,Lape0019,2018-04-30 17:26:00,647,"Saw a Kia Soul one day with a trailer that did not belong on the back of it. Figured, whatever, probably just a 16-17 foot tin tiller. Nope. Backs down the steel grated ramp and proceeds to put an 18.5 foot Four winns bow rider on the trailer. The squealing that those tires made was hilarious.. A couple of years ago, I get to the free launch in town at about 7:30 in the morning. There is a guy sitting at the ramp with the trailer tires just touching the water, the TM is sticking straight up in the air (assuming a GPS enable one that he wants to get the GPS lock on) with the boat still on the trailer. I figure, I've got time to unhook everything and by the time I am done, he will be gone. Well...I was wrong. I finish moving everything and he's literally sitting there waiting now. Not doing a damn thing so I go over and ask what he's doing... Before I get an answer, a car comes peeling into the ramp, stops in front of the boat and a guy hops out. what felt like an eternity was probably 5 minutes but this guy made three trips to his car, then parked his care before backing this guy in and clearing the ramp. All in all, I was there for 20 minutes and this guy never moved... And then there are the stupid things I've done in a rush. The one that I still shake my shed at is why I only undid one transom strap?"
1027672,JoshS,2018-04-30 18:39:00,729,"First time ever launching my boat. Super monumental exciting moment in my life. Busy day at the launch. Backed in, started it up, hit reverse but couldn't get the boat off the trailer for some reason? Backed the car back a tad more and still couldn't slide the boat off? Quickly realized I forgot to take off everything on the back... transom saver and straps. One of my brightest moments. Made for a good laugh."
1027673,Lape0019,2018-04-30 19:09:00,647,Dad managed to launch his boat with the transom saver still attached to the motor!
1027679,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-30 20:55:00,8243,"So did I. I also watched a poor guy have his brand new 14' boat slide off those ice like bunks about 5 feet short of the water. Totaled the engine and transom. Not funny though. The funniest thing in the last few years was watching a few guys try to pull their 1/2 sunken 20 foot glasser up a hill and out of the water. They put a strap through the bow eyelet and tied the other end to the hitch on a 1/2 ton, not a 4X4. They try to pull ahead and the boat stays where it sits. A discussion ensues and they try again. The truck and boat move about 3 feet and then the boat slides back in the water but doesn't stop where it was stuck in the muddy bottom. It goes 15 feet further back than it was and so the truck flows it right into the creek water up to the windows of the cab. The driver had to crawl through the window to get out. Finally they get a tractor and someone came up with the novel idea to pump most of the water in the boat out before they try again. The funny but sad part was the owner of the little marina next door to their marina suggested they pump the water out first and they should use a good 4 wheel drive vehicle to pull a boat up a slippery hill."
1027680,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-30 20:55:00,8243,Did he get wet?
1027688,HTHM,2018-04-30 22:56:00,4082," I had forgotten about that Tom. We did save the day though... Listen you old fart, just because a mis-fastened anchor rope undid a seat lock once, doesn't mean I go swimming every time I fish...  I still blame you for that regardless of what you might say. There is no way you are ever going to out-stubborn this Dutchman."
1027690,Rattletrap2,2018-04-30 23:48:00,1652,"I'm sure i could come up with a few stories about some of my own best moves at the boat launch, but when we had our trailer on Dalrymple for 26 years, the highlight of my summer vacation was to head into Orillia one evening for a feast at King's Buffet then grab an ice cream cone and head over to the public launch ramp in Orillia to watch the launch ramp antics while the kids played at the park! Classic entertainment!"
1027695,OhioFisherman,2018-05-01 02:16:00,6623,"My first time launching at the main ramp in Lorain Ohio was with my brother, we pulled in and there was a couple of cops standing around, so I asked my brother if something was happening. No, just the normal weekend crowd, they are there to keep stuff from happening, usually it didn't take long for a fight to breakout. They put that ramp in a good location, just a short walk to the cell block!"
1027718,Mister G,2018-05-01 13:46:00,1429,"LONG time ago my buddy Bob and his father wanted to go fishing with the rest of us.....since the one boat my friend Dan had wasn't big enough for all of us Bob, his father and I rented a boat......long story short we traveled a long ways to the crappie fishing grounds and by the time we wanted to head back the winds were blowing a LOT....... So to shorten the trip we decided to borrow Dan's car and trailer because he launched MUCH closer to where we were........making the boating trip back to shore less then half. My buddies father known as JP was a older man with a peg leg from birth......so on the way in he knelt in the small 16' rental and used a rain jacket to ward off waves/spray in order to stay dry.......believe it not he stayed 100% dry while we got WET on the way in. So I back down Dan's trailer at the launch we never used and it was quite steep to say the least...... JP decided to just stay in the boat because of his peg leg while we cranked the boat onto the trailer....... Now this is where is got hilarious (now) as Bob held the boat straight for the borrowed trailer and I just kept cranking it to his orders...... Well JP was at the back of the boat with his weight holding down the transom as the bow kept rising up the trailer. Before we knew it water started to POUR into the boat over the transom completely soaking a once dry JP to the knees.......the boat took in so much water that the 3 gallon gas tank and cooler started to float away.........LOL We had to get JP out of the boat and drain it because the car would not pull the boat up the steep ramp with all the extra weight. Every time I think of JP staying dry for over an hour while fighting the waves only to get completely soaked to his knees just makes me laugh even more. I hope JP is laughing as much in heaven as I'm laughing down here."
1027724,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-01 14:37:00,8243,"Yep, field device malfunction. I've tried to re enact that failure many times as diligently as an NSB investigator to no avail.  Luckily because of the make up of your cranium you popped right back to the surface. Good luck on the water this year Big Guy and stay safe."
1027728,AKRISONER,2018-05-01 16:29:00,5558,"i love all of the sentiment about Lake O and the gongshow that it is...ive launched a grand total of one time on lake O and wouldnt you know it ive got a story to tell. Well 2 actually...first one was that i launched our boat no issues and then sure enough as I am about to pull away a guy visiting the park comes up and decides to park right infront of the ramp so that I cant turn into the parking area...so i nudge forward right up to him, he proceeds to move forward about 5 feet....this i a big big parking lot and there are cars parked all down a row right in front of him, but buddy decided that his parking spot was going to be in the way of the boat ramp. I now have to make a three point turn off of the ramp just to make the corner and theres no way for me to be able to turn into my parking spot with a straight trailer...i have to get out and deadlift the thing into place... Then on the way in on the same day we pull up and the scene is set...so stereotypical. Theres a 30 something year old young guy with his new to him 1995 20 foot bow rider that he clearly had purchased over the winter and was taking his young good looking wife, kid and dog out for its maiden voyage...he hops out of the boat and goes to get the truck while his wife holds the ropes...we were in no hurry she was fun to look at anyways... Buddy proceeds to back the trailer in but then backs it in so deep that his truck tires are in the water and his trailer is gone lol...he brings the boat forward and it nearly hits the back of the truck, then it gets wedged on the winch because its floating so high... Through all of this i notice his motor is still down and im gonna give him the benefit of the doubt...He hops in the truck and maneuvers it even deeper to get the boat unwedged then walks back...then hops back in the truck and sure enough he takes off...I start yelling STOPPPPP and they do not before dragging the bottom end of his motor up the boat ramp...he stops and realizes what hes done...we then pull our boat out as he is prepping everything for towing...and proceeds to leave without any tie down straps at all."
1027751,KawarthaGuy,2018-05-01 23:11:00,46,"So I back in, launch the boat, it glides off smoothly into the lake.  I walk around the trailer and pull on the bow line to bring the boat back to the dock when the line snaps and there is a good off-shore breeze.  So I start flipping off my shoes, socks, pull out my wallet, keys, off goes the shirt and now the boat is about 20 yards offshore.  Dive in, head-up front crawl aka Johnny Weissmuller to the boat and grab the remaining rope and swim it back to shore. A little excitement to start the day but felt good to hear the applause! Kawartha Guy"
