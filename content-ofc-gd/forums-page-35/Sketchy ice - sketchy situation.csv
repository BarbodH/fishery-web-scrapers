I don't do it for a fish.  I would never risk my life for a fish.    If a fish where to be held a gunpoint during a bank robbery, I would not jump in front of a bullet for it."
1055167,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-17 18:47:00,8243,"One could try to rob a bank with the business end of a Swordfish, no? One need not do back flips on a bike to consider riding to be hazardous at some point. I've come close too many times riding to decide not to tempt fate any longer and stuck the bike in the back corner of the garage. No back flips required. I'm laffing out load here."

1055225,moxie,2020-01-19 05:15:00,1566,"Glad you're alright. I went for a Simcoe swim  as a teen 30+ years ago in gear that should have sunk me like an anchor. To this day the only thing I can think of that allowed me to live another day was adrenaline. Although I still get out on the ice it's with caution leading the way and I always wear a float suit of some sort. Purchased a couple of Fladen one piece(available in a 2 PC) suits years ago. Ordered them from a website in the UK. Each suit was 75 British pounds and shipping was whatever but the final cost per suit was approx $240 Canadian. These suits are used for work on the high seas . They're lightweight, offer a full range of motion and reasonably warm. Good value for money . Still have the suit but have moved on to a Promax snowmobile suit with floatation. A set of coat and bibs will run you about $500 but along with the safety aspect of floatation  they are designed for riding and therefore offer all the cold weather benefits as well."
1055226,AKRISONER,2020-01-19 13:30:00,5558,I ended up going with a salus. I’m praying it’s warm enough! Haven’t got a chance to test it out yet. Definitely wanted something coast guard approved for riding in the boat in the fall
1055250,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-20 04:39:00,8243,It would be prudent to jump in the water in a controlled environment and test new suits. The best test would be now rather than June. I've gone under the ice twice at work when I was getting the experience part of my motto below. It hurts and is frightening all at the same time.
1055253,Rizzo,2020-01-20 13:38:00,4754,"glad to hear it worked out. Not sure I want to ""test"" my ability to get out. I worry the cold shock from the initial plunge would do my heart in. Every year when i wait til October to bring in the swim platform (gotta get under it to unhook the anchor) I think I am done for. This past year I wore a lifejacket doing it so they would at least find my corpse"
1055256,NAW,2020-01-20 13:58:00,4022,"I have developed this very odd reaction to cold in the past 4 or 5 years.  And it's getting worse and worse.  I get a really nasty rash that swells up and get all blotchy and puffy.   I started noticing it while out winter running.  Then it started happening running the boat in early and late seasons with cold water splashing my face...   Now if I swim in cold water, my entire body gets this rash and it's quite nasty.  I think if I fell through, I would puff up and explode inside my floater suite.  Joking about the ladder obviously, but not about the rash.  I would literally be a huge amount of pain for hours after going through for the rash alone."
1055316,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 00:45:00,5558,My 11 year old nephew also has this. It’s an allergy to the cold. He breaks out in hives if his skin is too exposed for too long. Sucks you’ve developed it later in life.
1055343,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 16:26:00,5558,"an update on my suit situation for anyone who cares (probably no one) I ended up going with a Salus Odysee and outright, from Mustang, to nautilus/helly hansen, striker and FXR, this suit hands DOWN is the best suit IMO that I have seen/worn. Waterproof pockets, zipped fleece chest pockets, an internal vest for taking your arms out when its warm, a built in extraction harness, double cinched arm cuffs the list of features are nuts and the best feature of all? It was made in canada but $100 cheaper than the mustang and they 1 day fedexed it to me for free. I would highly highly highly recommend these suits to anyone in the market for one. Holy cow im actually blown away."
1055348,NAW,2020-01-21 16:55:00,4022,Good call man.  I ran a Salus endurance class which I think is one or 2  levels below the Odysee.  They are amazing.  I ran it for 8 years then sold it to a friend.  I went though last year early season.  but the double cuffs on the ankles and wrists..  He bounced out and didn't even get wet.  Kept fishing as if nothing happened....  That's an 8 year old suite.  I've fished it in the pouring rain and not got wet inside the suite at all!  You will not regret it.
1055353,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 18:33:00,5558,had to share because its rare these days when you buy something that it exceeds expectations especially to the point that I am blown away. This thing is a massive upgrade over my nautilus and I was concerned that I couldnt get one of that old quality anymore and now ive got a suit that I am even far more happier with. Hope I never end up needing the floatation component of it again!
1055551,Cando,2020-01-23 22:35:00,90,"That was one scary read and I am glad that you all made it home safe and sound my friend. I will never go ice fishing ever since I have been confined to a wheelchair. Ice can be really thick but if there is an air pocket, you never know what could happen."

Its not comfortable at all, its very hard to move in. I used it last year but it wasnt warm and mobility sucked. I went with more of a winter jacket this year.  Edit: I cant find this Nautilus brand? they go out of business? I can only find the Mustang stuff, which I have one of already. And the entire Mustang suit is $700 😐"

I hate wearing it lol......and haven't in years. The reason most of these floater suits that aren't approved don't make the cut is the colour. They are required to be a bright colour (red, yellow, orange) to comply with the standards. Even my camoflauge mustang suit is not approved, and its essentially the same as an orange one.  These other companies (striker, frabile, clam etc) also have to pay major bucks to have these suits tested, and that adds to the price out the door to us, the reason an approved suit is pushing a $1000 out the door. They just aren't warm. I dont find them warm anyways. Wear some quality warm gear, then a float suit, and you will feel the difference right away. Always feel damp in a foater.  S."
1054741,AKRISONER,2020-01-09 14:53:00,5558,"yup, another dead canadian company. Unfortunately this company made a super high end quality product. Couldnt compete with the made in china crap and gone with the wind. Closest thing is the Mustang Integrity Deluxe, but even it isnt as nice. Im actually kinda ticked off, my suit aside from losing its waterproofing due to wear and age is a beast. Last year another crappy now made in china piece of junk Jiffy auger friggin overheated and melted a giant hole right into the front chest pocket of my suit."
1054883,T-Bone,2020-01-12 14:21:00,160,"Having never meaningfully been ice fishing before (twice many years ago, on a small lake with about 1.5 feet of ice on it), I have to ask a question that seems to have no reasonable answer. Why would you take such considerable risk for you and others to simply go out fishing for a few hours? I can't imagine you surround the remainder of your life or hobby pursuits with such risk, or play with loaded guns, or drive excessively fast in traffic, or worst of all drive while impaired. Leaves me scratching my head why you would tempt tragedy to just go fishing."
1054885,Moosebunk,2020-01-12 14:37:00,3970,"WOW! Wasn't expecting that read at all but thanks for sharing.  A serious reminder and especially important with the crap ice season and climate this winter. It's sketchy out there!  Drove the skidoo out onto 8 inches of ice on a tiny back lake this week.  Cruising around later in the day to punch different holes found an open spot in the middle, likely where a spring is.  Realized when I stopped the skidoo I parked on 4 inches, that open water barely visible was maybe 75 feet away.  Gotta smarten up and stay that way out there. Glad you and the dog are all good!"
1054897,Fisherman,2020-01-12 18:25:00,7201,"Life is risk in itself,  you have to evaluate every situation and make a decision, do I or don't I.  With a healthy dose of safety, the majority come back home unscathed.  Those that throw common sense to the wind may perish.  The last one I remember that was rebroadcast from just over a year ago, was the one in Muskoka,  snowmobile riding around midnight where the dad lost his sons.  Bad choice."
1054915,GBW,2020-01-13 02:56:00,8460,"If you don't fish on the ice why comment in the manner you have to compare it to a drunk driver???!??  We all make mistakes (on ice or in a boat) as I am sure you are far from perfect.  We all are and his post was a good read and reminder for some...  Take it for what it is, a lesson learned and shared."
1054920,AKRISONER,2020-01-13 04:49:00,5558,"Like most things, you take preventative measures to ensure that when things go catastrophically bad, that you will be able to get yourself out of the situation. in this case, I made a really bad error in judgement and the impact was simply that I got cold and had to dry my suit out literally for a week. that’s extremely low negative impact all things considered and the reason why is that I took every single other preventative measure possible. Absolutely had I not been dressed appropriately, aware of the ice conditions on the “good sections” of the lake, able to visibly see bad ice due to lack of snow cover (one of the key reasons for us even venturing out at all in the first place) ventured too far from home or been alone, all things I considered befofe venturing out, the situation could have ended horribly. So in the end I can live with the fact that I did basically everything else according to the book, I was with a friend walking in a line with myself in the lead checking the ice. wearing a survival suit, equipped with picks, and walking out very close to home allowing me to get home very easily should the worst happen. the comparisons you use are funny because quite literally the most dangerous activity anyone does on a day to day basis is drive a car. No one ever gives a second thought to it. Just like driving though, being overtired, making judgements in error and driving too fast/not according to conditions, being drunk, not wearing a seatbelt etc etc not doing any of these things allow you to mitigate the risks associated with driving. you are definitely more likely to die from heart disease from sitting on your behind all winter than you are getting outside and dying ice fishing. most horror stories you hear there is far far more at play than just some innocent soul falling through bad ice and dying. The most common of which is attempting to navigate lakes at night on a snowmobile without a floater suit on. I personally hate lake crossing at night, it’s disorientating as all hell and super difficult to have any spacial awareness unless the shoreline is immediately visible. When it snows nearly all bets are off and I would admit it’s very dangerous. Once again, this is where preventative and common sense measure can help you avoid trouble. Getting drunk and going for a rip out on the lake at midnight or leaving the ice shack to go home absolutely wasted is a recipe for disaster. Unfortunately lots of folks take a taste of that spoon and make the rest of the responsible, cautious, careful people a bad rep. "
1054925,T-Bone,2020-01-13 13:57:00,160,Why come at me like that? Having a bad day? I was simply inquiring to try and understand the power of pull ice fishing provides.

No, I don't have a death wish, and I won't take chances if it's a long ways to safety. But I've got little hesitation hoping on thin ice over still water if self rescue and a warm car/house is close by.

Fact is, if your aware of the risks and are prepared to deal with a dunking, taking advantage of early ice can be very rewarding, even if you do get wet once in a blue moon. Actually, I would go as far as to encourage folks to step out of their comfort zone and even intentionally go for a dunk through the ice(under controlled conditions, shallow water and saftey rope)! Getting a real life understanding of how your suit and saftey gear functions will make you that much more comfortable if something unexpected does happen.... Josh "

1055028,AKRISONER,2020-01-15 21:28:00,5558,"I definitely admitted I put my dog at risk. I put that out clear as day that I made the mistake and definitely learned from it. I 100% put myself at risk, just like anyone does any time they leave the house. I also backcountry snowboard where the risk of being in an aavalanche is extremely high in comparison to just staying on the resort. once again, just like going on the ice, you do what you can to mitigate risks. Wearing appropriate gear and carrying a beacon, probe and shovel. finally you said that I was putting my friend at risk? I am not in control of him. In fact as funny as it is, it was his idea to try and fish a different area in the first place. My responsibility to him is as simple as his is to me. We both take the right precautions and we both agree to help eachother should anything bad happen. I’m not certain where I’m responsible for his respective  choices? He’s an experienced fisherman wearing the appropriate gear too. finally your reference to first responders...I can assure you right now that if I was needing first responders just like anyone else that ventures into the wilderness...I’d be dead long before they would ever be able to save me. There was 0 chance the cops were going to save my life if I was stuck in that water for an hour. they might go look for my body, but my survival suit, picks and rope were going to get me out of that water long before they ever showed up. Roelefson has a point, people should go in and see what it’s like. You’ll be more confident and comfortable when it happens unexpectedly. also the comments about cracking ice, there isn’t almost anything more true than that. The sketchiest ice is quite. Soft ice doesn’t make noise!"

It read like a Tom Clancy novel. Complete with the Hero living to tell about it thank God. Close one eh kid? Just the other night I was watching one of those reality Cop shows and a dog went through the ice when on a walk with his buddy and was nearly dead from scratching on the ice around a 4' hole. You could see the blood from the Pups paws clawing on the edge of the ice., he had been in there for only about 10 minutes when the water rescue crew got to him. Only 5' of water yet both rescuers donned their dry dive suits before they went in. Anyone could have jumped in a pond only 5' deep. If someone did that within a minute someone else would need to now rescue both a Dog and a Man. Just the look on that pups face wanted me to well up, OK I did. A job without a plan is a plan for disaster. I hope all the folks here that venture out onto our ice in our beautiful lakes and rivers take something away from your experience. There is no such thing as too much preparation. If only one of the guys here do something better to help prepare themselves for a bad day because of your post and it saves someone else's or their own life you have done what you were put here on Earth for.

1055103,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-16 22:47:00,8243,"It begs the question as well as to why do people drive cars on a track at 300 MPH? Climb mountains, wind surf on Lake Erie in ice cold water in November and December when the winds are 130KPH, and, and, and? If that windsurfer or mountain climber needs to be rescued a discussion as far as who pays may start. Actually back country downhill skiers and snow boarders are being charged for rescues out west now depending on circumstances. That topic comes up here once in a while. When I see a reporter from news agencies standing next to the ocean in a 100 MPH plus Hurricane to show people sitting on the couch what a Hurricane looks like then I really shake my head. That is just ignorant. A person with a semblance of intelligence that does stupid things is ignorant. Ice fishing is neither stupid nor ignorant. If one decides to take a risk and fish on 1"" ice well then I have to question their intelligence and or decision making. Last time we went to Quinte I found we were going to fish on 1 or 2 inches ice. I spent the day in the mall and in the motel room watching fishing shows. My 2 fishing partners did stay on the ice, their choice. That night and next morning it was brutally cold and had a good 4"", I fished then. Yep got the Skunk eye and had 2 Mickey D's Fillet O Fish sangwidges on the way home."
1055136,chris.brock,2020-01-17 07:48:00,4053,I've heard of quite a few stories from people around my cottage where the dog has gone through thin ice and chaos ensues with the rescue attempt.

I just ordered the Salus suit, the damn thing comes with a harness for extraction built into it! all i gotta do now is tie a rope to the harness and let my buddies haul my ass out lol"
1054606,AKRISONER,2020-01-06 14:02:00,5558,"Well guys I’m posting to tell you about my mistake and a scary situation I found myself in yesterday. ive been on the ice since early December, taking all of the precautions, wearing the float suit, carrying picks. Spudding around, measuring ice and of course staying extremely close to home <200 meters. with the wild weather I have fished on some absolutely atrocious ice this year but I made a mistake this past weekend and i should have known better. Basically anywhere right now that water flows on my lake was completely wide open. That also includes near any structure such as docks or boat houses. saturday night we had a cold snap up north and it got to -11 overnight which happily for me really solidified the terrible ice that we had and also locked up a lot of the open areas with a skim of ice again. here’s where I made a stupid mistake. Once again taking all precautions me and my buddy decided that we wanted to try fish about a 5 minute walk down the lake for the day. If you know me, my dog basically always comes fishing with me. He’s a 30lb cocker spaniel lab mix, extremely intelligent, an incredible swimmer, absolutely loves the water but loves running out on the ice even more. with there being 5 inches of clear ice on the lake now I thought absolutely nothing of having him come out for the walk down the lake to fish. Well sure enough just as we were arriving where we wanted to fish I hear my buddy say “oh $|-|!7” I look and cash had gone near a rock outcrop where water had been rushing down into the lake he was about 10 meters from shore, and he was swimming for his life. im very confident on the ice because I take the required precautions, and furthermore I know that when I’m close to home and wearing a floater with picks, if I go in I’m getting cold and going home no big deal. I never considered that my dog could ever fall through being 30lbs and on 4 feet. I sat for a second and thought first of all, ok what’s the situation, can he get himself out, can I safely get him out? And I thought about the people that have died trying to save their dogs. I calculated everything and knew that I could easily get out and home from where I was at so I dropped my sled rope, said to my buddy, “I gotta save him” I watched cash narrowly miss getting himself out of the water and as he fell back in backwards I could tell he was now really scared. It was a weird feeling walking towards that crappy ice. It started to crack under my feet. I was walking probably on half an inch of ice. I then got onto my stomach and started to army crawl closer to the hole and In I went. Adrenaline surging through my veins I didn’t even feel the cold aside from my boots noticeably filling with ice water slowly. Cash scrambling swam back to me and I forced him towards shore where I was then able to push him out. Now here I am swimming in about 5 feet of water. I was able to consciously decide. To hell with the picks I’m going to see if I can get out without them. Sure enough totally calm I got out no problem at all the float suit nearly launching me onto the ice as I kicked. made the walk home and here were my observations. 1. my feet were soaked and boots were full of water it felt like walking in ice buckets. That hurt and was miserable. 2. My hands really started getting cold after the 5 minute walk and a bit of the adrenaline cut out. 3. My hiking hard 5 minutes home completely zipped up in my survival suit, I started actually warming up. This was incredible to me. Those suits with the wrists cinched and the zipper done all of the way up I could feel the heat building in my body incredible 4. when I got home and took my under layers off, my undershirt was actually fairly dry! I couldn’t believe that the cinches on the suit kept a lot of water out. Sections of my sweater were also dry. Pretty incredible considering I had literally gone underwater for a second when I first fell through the ice. 5. you can literally feel yourself dying after you plunge. The first thing I noticed was that I tried to tell my buddy that I’d be ok and that he could meet me at home but even in my calm relatively warm state it was very difficult to talk. As I marched home my breathing was heavier from walking fast and my chest felt super tight as if I had a chest cold. Warming up made that go away entirely. my dog didn’t like the feeling of the cold water on his fur so he scandanavian bathed the whole way home rolling in the snow to try and dry off. lesson learned. Don’t mess with sketchy ice unless you have 100% control of the situation. Never ever go on bad ice without a float suit (I never will again) stay calm and the act of falling through and getting out is actually nowhere near as bad as the horror stories seem to make them out to be. If you are prepared, wearing the right clothing, calm and carrying the right tools, you will most likely survive to post about it here another day. ive heard people suggest it but it’s true, if you spend a lot of time on the ice, go in and then get yourself out. You’ll see what if feels like, what getting out is like so that when it unexpectedly happens to you you’ll be an old pro. last but not least, I don’t give a damn what you hear, the ice can be 5 inches and clear, with people snowmobiling etc etc, if there’s snow on the ice all bets are off. If you can’t see what you are walking on at all times, you gotta be checking. The switch in quality in a spot that I would have never imagined to have bad ice was incredible. Lesson learned I should have been more accountable for my dog myself and my buddy."

1054609,AKRISONER,2020-01-06 14:59:00,5558,"I was going to be ok no matter what because I could see the bad ice. I got to make the decision to let him potentially drown while keeping myself safe or save him. I can honestly say that if i was not wearing the floater and didnt have picks, my dog wouldnt be alive today...thats hard to think about."
1054610,b_cdot,2020-01-06 15:53:00,270,glad you are ok
1054612,lew,2020-01-06 16:29:00,12766,Dogs don't understand danger so if there's any issues with ice I'd for sure leave the pooch in the cottage. Good to hear it all ended well for both of you.
1054613,Ronzo,2020-01-06 16:36:00,124,Glad to hear it turned out OK. Scary situation for sure. Good job to take time and think rather than just going for it.
1054614,AKRISONER,2020-01-06 16:39:00,5558,"absolutely, that was 100% my mistake. The ice was so good where we were walking that I didnt consider that there could be spots that were that bad still that he would be able to easily access without totally running off to the other side of the lake. Turns out he just had to go over that one 10x10 spot of ice in the whole area. Next time he will be staying home for sure!"
1054620,NAW,2020-01-06 19:49:00,4022,"Well man, we all make mistakes.  Thanks for sharing yours!  I was hiking in the bush with my .22 hunting grouse one year when we had some good early ice.  And I accidentally walked over a partly frozen stream.  Turns out it was about 3' deep in the middle where I broke through.   But the way the ice broke, it end up on a 45° angle, which caused me to slip fall on my butt in the water, which was now up to my neck.   I was able to break the ice up and stand up straight,.  but then I need to reach back down under the water to get my rifle....  Then break my way back to the shore and climb out! Same deal, about 5 minute light jog home.  Except I was in a cheap insulated coveralls.  So I was absolutely drenched to the bone and boot full of water. You described it perfectly.....  The ice has been F'd up this year.  I was on 8"" Sunday morning, but I was spudding.  I always spud, even on thick ice.  I use it as a walking stick.  And you can tell just by the sound and the ""pong"" if the ice is changing.  Sure as poop, I smacked ice and could tell it had changed.  Pop a quick hole, 2"" of ice.....   Stay safe man."
1054627,David Chong,2020-01-06 22:29:00,836,"Scary stuff for sure! I'm glad that you & Cash are okay! I never take any chances, even though I'm prepared with a floater & ice picks. Be safe out there everyone!"
1054629,Big Cliff,2020-01-06 22:50:00,6899,"All I can say is ""Thank God both you and your dog are alive because I'd have hated to read about this in the paper""!!!!!"
1054630,ketchenany,2020-01-06 23:19:00,3229,Keep safe AKRI no fish is worth a life. Great sport but dangerous at the same time. I have seen some beauties on Simcoe in the 80s. With “cowboys on snowmobiles”   
1054632,Musky Plug,2020-01-06 23:54:00,398,"That's nuts, good to hear you and the dog made it out!"
1054642,OhioFisherman,2020-01-07 03:57:00,6623,"I'm glad you and your dog are ok, you only get so many chances in life, don't use them up early."
1054643,GBW,2020-01-07 04:04:00,8460,"Wow man, great read and scary for me the way you wrote it.  I have NO clue if what I would have done.  Happy you are all okay!  Cheers for staying calm to get out of it with the pup still by your side now."
1054646,misfish,2020-01-07 11:17:00,29133,"Scary S man. Glad it all worked out. No ice is safe ice. I sometimes get carried away and walk and chip to fast. Just in a hurry to get to my fishing grounds. Your story has made me rethink this now. Glad it all turned out well for you bud. Yes, leave the pooch at home. They always like to wander.  "
1054653,gordy28,2020-01-07 14:18:00,638,Wow - crazy story and glad you and your dog are okay 
1054698,Tjames09,2020-01-08 16:17:00,664,"Scary story. What kind of floater suit do you wear? Ive been wanting to test mine, in warmer weather lol. I have a striker ice float pants and jacket, but its heavy just walking, cant imagine it being soaked with water trying to move."
1054700,AKRISONER,2020-01-08 17:21:00,5558,"I wear a one piece nautilus. It needs replacing but the $1,000+ price tag of suits that quality sucks. It’s a shame nautilus doesn’t even seem to make them anymore. I think helly hanson makes something similar. That’s what scares me about those striker suits. They are advertised as ice fishing suits and come with picks etc. but they aren’t flotation devices. They are just meant to keep you warm not keep you alive if you go in. it sounds like you have their float suit version. Is it coast guard approved? my snowmobiling suit is an fxr floater, I should jump in with it now and see if it’s much different. the nautilus felt like I was wearing a life jacket I was super buoyant"
1054703,Tjames09,2020-01-08 19:32:00,664,"I dont think any ice fishing suits are coast guard approved. Not the ones hat keep you warm as well. I have a Striker Ice Climate Jacket which has ""150g Sureflote® Flotation Assistance Technology"". But I dont know how well it will float, its supposed to though.  I dont think the FXR ones are coast guard approved either, its probably a similar product.  I believe the entire Striker Ice lineup floats, I dont think they make products that dont. Its the same as most jackets sold at Bass Pro in the ice fishing section."
1054704,GBW,2020-01-08 20:02:00,8460,My Mustang suit is.
1054705,AKRISONER,2020-01-08 20:11:00,5558,"yup my nautilus is as well but its beat and needs replacing. Worked well though! Speaking of, has anyone seen the ""deluxe"" mustang at cabellas or anywhere in vaughan/barrie? I see that sail sells them but they are sold out. I am thinking of retiring my old full of holes dirty as hell and no longer waterproof suit after its one actual usage lol."
1054706,Fisherman,2020-01-08 20:28:00,7201,"Last year I checked for the Mustang Integrity Coats, very hard to find and going for over $700.  I checked their ""Catalyst"" series and felt they weren't much more than a life jacket inside a coat.  Seemed like a lot of void areas.  The one piece suits don't fit me well, need what would amount to an xxl top an xl bottom, inseams are too long.  This is the one I was hoping for https://www.stevestonmarine.com/floatation-clothing/mustang-thermosystem-plus-coat"
1054708,NAW,2020-01-08 21:09:00,4022,"My old Salus banana suite was coast guard approved.  And my new(used) nautilus jacket is coast guard approved.  But my pants are snowmobile pants that have flotation, but not approved.  if I went through I would be drenched to the bone...  But I would float!  WAY more comfy in the hut to be able to take my jacket off though.  So to me it's worth it.  I never seem to go through when I am wearing my floater anyway!"
1054709,misfish,2020-01-08 21:16:00,29133,"This suit is sweet but your going to pay for it.  I had the nautilus coast guard one piece. It was great, but bulky. The upper part felt like I had a large PFD on."
