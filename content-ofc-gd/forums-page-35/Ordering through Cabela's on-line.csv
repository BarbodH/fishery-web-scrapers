1055184,b_cdot,2020-01-17 21:58:00,270,It is odd. I've ordered a lot from cabelas canada. I've had a few glitches in shipping over the years. I've called whenever there's been a problem and they usually clear it up. It's quite possible that what you ordered was suddenly placed on backorder and they didn't charge you.
