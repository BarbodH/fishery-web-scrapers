I've been coming to Cranberry Lake, Seeley's Bay, ON for the last 41 years on a fishing trip. If anyone would like to share their pictures, stories, fishing advice about Cranberry Lake or the surrounding area it would be most appreciated. I hope to be posting our pictures shortly. "

By the way we call our buddy Dominic, The Mick. Sometimes something else that starts with a D instead."

I heard there are some decent smallies in Cranberry but they don’t stack up until later in the fall and during the summer they’re invisible! Lol "
