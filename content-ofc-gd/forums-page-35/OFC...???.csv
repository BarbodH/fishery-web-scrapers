1055451,NAW,2020-01-22 18:21:00,4022,Saw a truck today with a big OFC sticker on the back window.Â  Â Heading from the area of the bait shop in Barrie heading to the lake.  I got a little giddy thinking it was a Ontario FishingÂ  Community Member. Maybe some new stickers TJ designed and I just didn't know about.  NOPE...Â  OFC.ca.  What the hell.Â  Â Didn't even know it existed.  We're not a club.. we are a community!!
1055452,TJQ,2020-01-22 18:24:00,7806,Thinking I may work on some hats and decals if anyones intertested..
1055455,GBW,2020-01-22 18:27:00,8460,"Yeah Nick, they are FULLY scamming the OFC name!!"
1055459,NAW,2020-01-22 19:01:00,4022,I'd be down for a few. Still got a couple OFC items from our little Calendar Bay get together many many years ago!!
1055461,TJQ,2020-01-22 19:06:00,7806,many moons ago.
1055466,John,2020-01-22 19:29:00,2956,Still have my hats and toque although I believe they are OFC. I do have my OFC speedo though...ðŸ˜²
1055467,John,2020-01-22 19:30:00,2956,Needs to be resurrected..
1055470,lew,2020-01-22 19:36:00,12766,"You had a lot of great stuff for sale back in the day TJ, hats, decals, mugs, even some really nice jackets.  Ole Marv really liked the touques to LOL "
1055472,TJQ,2020-01-22 19:37:00,7806,I still have a set of those jackets we use for curling teams.. lol
1055476,NAW,2020-01-22 20:08:00,4022,"I always wanted one of those tuques.Â  Â If you ever make more tuques, you need to count me in for a half a dozen..  I had a ball cap, 2 t-shirts, 1 mug, a nice measuring tape sticker that's still in my boat, and a mint little swiss-army knife with the OFC logo on the side..   back when I used to bike and run everywhere and weighed 170lbs...     "
1055485,Headhunter,2020-01-22 21:32:00,5703,I still have my toque from the fishing show at the International Centre somewhere around 13ish years ago? HH
