1055581,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-24 18:13:00,8243,Make an offer on the last day of the show of you are seriously buying. It costsÂ  dealers money to trailer the inventory back to their dealerships.
1055582,David Chong,2020-01-24 18:18:00,836,Prices on boats in general have skyrocketed but so has property values & so forth.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
