1055352,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 18:28:00,5558,the fact that some people consider that thing to be a boat launch is insane lol
1055405,Chuck Enwinde,2020-01-22 05:16:00,247,North side B.¬† Could be all the people that just tamped it down lol. I can tell you the walk on cooks is not as nice.
1055420,Dara,2020-01-22 14:28:00,3052,Looks Good Buddy  I want to ice fish Prosperous some time. Wife will be up there mid Feb. I just might try for next year. And that X is in a pretty nice spot  - 45 for a month though...how much extension you got for the auger
1055434,akaShag,2020-01-22 15:58:00,2073,"I think most of us are getting cabin fever down here in the south, as opposed to the Great White North.¬† I was out this morning on a favourite ""first ice"" spot, and about one-third the way to the fishing hole I was on 2.75 inches of ice.¬† It was good clear ice, but there was a pressure ridge between me and my intended spot...................and we turned around.¬† Plus temps forecast for the next while, it might be February before we get on to the ice down here. Doug"
1055445,Dara,2020-01-22 16:56:00,3052,"No cabin fever here Ice is good, snowmobile trails are good, heading for a week of riding saturday.  My view on ice is, I check it, if I can say, yup, I think its ok, I stay off. If I say..crap, tons of ice, then I go on. I do not need iffy ice"
1055477,akaShag,2020-01-22 20:14:00,2073,"No cabin fever there, and you're not down here in the banana belt!üòâ"
1055480,Dara,2020-01-22 20:38:00,3052,I guess you pick your poison. Report says I will be blowing the driveway every night for the next 2 weeks.  Moved here almost 45 years ago and never looked back.  My old fishing partner lives in Kingston...he kinda bums out now and again too
1055482,captpierre,2020-01-22 20:43:00,2521,"North of Quebec City likely 6 went through the ice on sleds and feared drowned. ¬†Channel area with current, apparently. Be careful."
1055620,LefroyFisherman,2020-01-25 16:33:00,602,"I was out yesterday afternoon around the 7th line of innisfil, sketchy ice to me, 2 inches or so of soft ice that you broke through occasionally when walking on it and then maybe 2-3 inches of good ice underneath, I did not¬†go out very far, little uncomfortable for me. Maybe another week, hopefully. What a crazy winter, it seemed like it would be a long winter in November."
1055623,misfish,2020-01-25 17:39:00,29133,"Just back from the bay here. Bare ice areas are 6"" but still soft under areas where snow was. 1.5-3 "". Anyone know a bait to catch cell phones"
1055624,LefroyFisherman,2020-01-25 17:41:00,602,"Ouch, that sucks... magnet?"
1055626,misfish,2020-01-25 17:56:00,29133,"I watched it on the finder. It was straight down at the 20 fow mark, then disappeared. I am sure it,s way off my hole location. That will teach me to use the light for the hut. It worked great in my old hut, nice snug fit. This one well, not so snug I guess. If it was a 6"" hole, it would of missed. LOL"
1055628,woodenboater,2020-01-25 18:25:00,2277,"ugh !!!!! ¬†mark the spot and see if someone wants to go down when the water is warmer ? if there a ton of pics etc on it, might be worth paying a diver to fish for it"
1055629,misfish,2020-01-25 18:27:00,29133,"It,s a work cell. No pics really. Just all my contacts. Not looking forward to Monday morning and explaining this. LOL"
1055630,woodenboater,2020-01-25 18:31:00,2277,thats a big ouchie bro (as riley would say lol)
1055633,GBW,2020-01-25 21:04:00,8460,"Just because this happens a lot, they now have floating cases.¬† It's a fear of mine too having this happen on the ice or in the boat."
1055634,Fisherman,2020-01-25 21:41:00,7201,"Brian, really, you know those strings your mom put on your mitts, gonna pay you a visit, lol."
1055635,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-25 21:51:00,8243,"The very 1st time I took my lady icefishing on Erie for perch I just dropped her line down the hole and she got a fish on. I leaned over the hole to get it and my brand new Oakley 's dropped straight down 8'. By the time I put a treble hook on my line to grapple it the current took it for a ride. I¬† was famous for dropping my phone down the toilet.¬† You got some esplainin' to do Lucy. Rain, rain go away. I don't like snow but will take it after what seems like 3 months of rain. Bad for the old bones and joints."
1055678,AKRISONER,2020-01-26 14:30:00,5558,"Somehow those phones always manage to hit that 6 inch hole in the hut and never land anywhere but the bullseye few years back mine fell outta my bib, I watched it bounce between my feet and then take off like a rocket and slide 3 feet across the hut for a perfect hole in one. I‚Äôve never made such a beauty shot in 20 years of golfing."
1055682,TJQ,2020-01-26 14:50:00,7806,Brand new.. and i mean brand new first day with a pair of prescription sunglasses..¬† looked down the hole and watched them go......
1055686,Big Cliff,2020-01-26 17:00:00,6899,"I wonder how many cell phones are at the bottom¬† of that lake, I¬† know I donated one a few years agoüòä"
1055688,ketchenany,2020-01-26 17:06:00,3229,I seen one go down. I was on the Bell Mobility account¬†at the time and my friend asked if there¬†was anything I could for him. Yes buy another phone. Brian take Monday off.

1055287,TJQ,2020-01-20 20:59:00,7806,Looks like it feels up here.. lol.. pretty frozen!
1055288,misfish,2020-01-20 21:05:00,29133,"Do not let it fool you. MAin lake is fresh ice. I would be surprised if it,s over 2"". Was wide open on Saturday. Warm spell coming again with snow."
1055290,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-20 21:20:00,10439,Today's sat image of Great Slave. Looks hard.¬† üòÅ The little red X is where my cabin is. 
1055294,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-20 21:37:00,8243,"Erie doesn't have an inch of ice on shore. But it sure is cold. The lakeshore trees are all covered in ice cycles from splashing waves yesterday. I haven't stuck my nose outside once today. and don't plan on it. The garbage pail and blue boxes will still be there tomorrow, or the day after. As soon as I think about going outside I just remember those frozen body parts working on the docks in February and turn up the heat."
1055295,Terry,2020-01-20 21:39:00,14456,cool 
1055296,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-20 21:40:00,8243,

1055301,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-20 22:21:00,8243,You are insane. -10C outside and 70F inside my shack and my fingers are freezing looking out the patio door just looking at the ice cycles hanging from tree branches.
1055305,Big Cliff,2020-01-20 22:28:00,6899,Tim Hales has huts out on the perch grounds as of today
1055306,Fisherman,2020-01-20 22:33:00,7201,"There's a pretty long crack from BBP all the way up the N/W shoreline,¬† and looks like a bunch of smaller ones E/W direction.¬†¬† Unfortunately looks like temps are rebounding."
1055312,glen,2020-01-20 23:32:00,2641,The snow is not helping. ¬† It might get slushy. ¬† Another year of crappy ice.
1055320,woodenboater,2020-01-21 02:43:00,2277,any way to atv to your cabin ? nice that you're not too far from town
1055323,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-21 03:31:00,10439,Only over the ice or by boat in the summer.
1055325,smitty55,2020-01-21 04:32:00,928,"So Dave if I have this right you are actually on a portion of the Yellowknife River north of route 4,¬† Ingraham trail?  Cheers"
1055327,Chuck Enwinde,2020-01-21 05:10:00,247,Pretty sure he's on Prosperous L.  And that crack off BBP must be about 100m wide in that pic.¬† At least most of the snow has blown off kemp already. 
1055328,cisco,2020-01-21 10:11:00,597,Hovercraft in service yet?
1055330,misfish,2020-01-21 11:12:00,29133,Where ? I need to find that spot LOL
1055336,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 14:39:00,5558,Apparently the bear point boys are out catching whities walking.
1055337,NAW,2020-01-21 15:30:00,4022,"Really eh.¬† As in this morning?¬† Or on the weekend.¬† It would have been insanely sketchy out that way on the weekend with that raging wind and 2"" of¬†ice..  Im pretty stoked for this weekend.¬† Going out for sure both days.¬† Then thursday and friday next week.¬† Quit my job, now I have a few days off to ice fish!!!"
1055339,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 15:57:00,5558,yesterday. Callum Johnsons instagram has him standing on probably close to 4 inches of clear ice catching whities.
1055341,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-21 16:08:00,10439,Not yet. Boat fixing used my time allotted to hovercraft fixing. Plan to do it this spring if all goes well.
1055342,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-21 16:13:00,10439,"Yep, it's connected to the Yellowknife River in the Southwest end. The river is navigable all the way to Yellowknife with a good jet boat. Watched ¬†a couple of boats with big inboard jets run up the rapids. Pretty impressive to watch."
1055347,misfish,2020-01-21 16:54:00,29133,Saturday was wide open.
1055349,AKRISONER,2020-01-21 16:58:00,5558,"just confirmed from instagram, you can call Calum 905-806-0443 ""bear point and most of kempenfelt bay towards barrie has between 3.5 and 6""¬†"" he says give him a call to discuss"
