1055615,John Bacon,2020-01-25 04:12:00,3277,How many of you have been using these?
1055617,LostAnotherOne,2020-01-25 04:55:00,956,Good post.Â  If someone post's a pic of a fish and its miles away from their chest I just roll my eyes and go on to the next one.Â  It's a rookie move.
1055632,Whitespinnerbait,2020-01-25 20:29:00,2038,"Rookie move ??..........look at any pro fisherman , magazine etc etc , THEY ALL DO IT !,,,"
1055636,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-25 21:56:00,8243,"When I take a pic of a buddy holding a nice catch I tell them ""Get those elbows in."" Bass Pros are the worse for doing the old straight arms. Looks like they are holding a 35"" Largemouth. Love the cheater prosthetics."
1055641,Pigeontroller,2020-01-25 22:21:00,2793,Bass pics only look decent if you fill the frame and hold them out! Its not cheating its taking a decent photo!
1055720,BillM,2020-01-27 01:36:00,17367,Worst trend in fishing pics in the last 10 years.Â  What's worse are the idiots that believe their buddy just caught a 15lb largie out of the Kawarthas because the pic is so distorted.Â  Same goes for muskie or pike.Â  Ridiculous.
1055721,Woodsman,2020-01-27 05:49:00,1286,It's been a pet peeve of mine for years. Like pictures where buddy has a hand twice the width of his head.
1055732,G.mech,2020-01-27 21:00:00,830,Always have an action figure in your tackle box...  
1055733,NAW,2020-01-27 21:16:00,4022,You need to learn the happy medium.Â  Can'tÂ haveÂ your arms locked straight.Â  But you also don't need to be hugging the fish!  Half cocked!!Â  Best of both worlds.
1055734,misfish,2020-01-27 21:32:00,29133,I love hugging my fish. Makes me warm and fuzzy inside. ðŸ¤£
1055735,Weeds,2020-01-27 21:34:00,782,Been thinking along the same line for years. Wondering where everyone has been catching jumbo perch that completely dwarf the biggest largemouth Iâ€™ve ever caught
1055738,DRIFTER_016,2020-01-27 22:29:00,10439,Just catch big fish and you don't have to cheat!!!!   
1055994,dave524,2020-02-03 15:47:00,4508,"Just take your trophy pics with an extra wide angle lens, no arm's length shenanigans required."
1055998,BillM,2020-02-03 18:13:00,17367,"I've seen a few OOD cover shots done like this, lol it's still bad."
1056004,dave524,2020-02-03 19:19:00,4508,"Even GoÂ ProsÂ create the same illusion with perspective and distort straight lines, I find curved horizons extremely annoying, grrrr"
1056007,BillM,2020-02-03 20:19:00,17367,"Yeah, I like UWA stuff but you've really gotta be careful with overdoing it.Â  The cover I was referring to was of Ben Beattie holding up a muskie.Â  It looked like it was 70inches long, lol."
1056022,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-04 03:25:00,10439,I like UWA too. Especially when trying to get a selfie with a fishy. Also I believe if you're shooting UWA you really should fix the shot in post as the curved look sucks. This was shot with my DSLR sitting on the rear casting chair of my boat. 
1056034,TJQ,2020-02-04 16:10:00,7806,DEFINITELY PHOTOSHOPPED!!Â  Â and also.. wheres the link to buy those grips? Asking for a friend.
