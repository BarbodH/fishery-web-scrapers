Managed to get a ling! This fish fought like a champ, went on couple of nice runs. I thought i had a nice musky on. This thing was so fat that it got stuck half way up the hole. I had to stick my hand in, lip it and pull it out lol.      This was the slimiest, worst smelling fish i ever came across. I could smell it 30 minutes later all over where it rolled on ice. I also got couple saugers, its been few years since i got into some of them.          They all went back down the hole to live another day. Tight lines   "

772303,irishfield,2013-03-07 03:36:00,26272,Nice hoping I can swing a trip for a few of those next week!
772306,Leecher,2013-03-07 04:00:00,7832,Good going Marko    Sounds like you had the thrill of a life time with that bottom feeder   but trout don't smell that strong
772326,chris.brock,2013-03-07 07:33:00,4053,"great report, 2 species that aren't very common too, looks like a fun day  what were you targeting?"
772649,Marko,2013-03-08 22:30:00,854,"Hey guys,  I dont know if they are any stinkier then the muskies, I got some slime on my pants. After i came home and took my pants off,  my dog started rolling on top of them...REALLY liked the smell haha.  Hey Jacques too bad we couldnt get on the ice this winter, crazy weather we had!  Hey Chris I was targeting walleye and sauger. Perch size jighead tipped with salted minnow. That thing straightened my jighead, its ruined haha"
772659,Locnar,2013-03-08 23:03:00,645,Those are some nice fish man. That ling looks like a beast. Saugers are some nice lookin' fish as well. Kudos on a good day of fishin
