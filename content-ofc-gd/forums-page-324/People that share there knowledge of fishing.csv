772217,chessy,2013-03-07 00:14:00,610,"My son got a fly rod given to him and I know absolutly nothing about fly fishing . Ron  was down at the ganny and when my son pulled out rod he showed my son how to use it and how to ""load the rod"" after about 20 min or so  Ron gave the rod to son he started to do his thing and got it out about 30 feet and on his very first drift he said i got one. he landed fish as we were all shocked that he got it on his first ever drift. Not only was it his first drift it was on a wooly bugger that he tied himself.  Thanks  Ron for showing him and kevin for netting it    Ron and Jt "

772265,NAW,2013-03-07 02:09:00,4022,The definition of Beginners luck!  That's awesome.  Got any pics of the fly?
772281,bare foot wader,2013-03-07 02:34:00,1354,"beauty fish...a lot of fly line on the ground, did he play it on the reel or hand line? props either way, healthy lookin steelie"
772348,cisco,2013-03-07 13:04:00,597,That Ron's a fine gentleman. Few years back I was fishing perch along with a million others and small ones seemed the norm.  Ron somehow spotted me and after showing me some huge jumbos he'd nailed and kindly offering me some tips I was able to get some also. Great ambassador to the sport!!!
772361,The Urban Fisherman,2013-03-07 14:58:00,2050,great post! Congrats!

772382,fishdawg,2013-03-07 17:07:00,912,great story! Ron's a gem!
772504,highdrifter,2013-03-08 07:10:00,2534,"WTG Ron.  Nice fish, nice post.  cheers HD"
772506,motv8tr,2013-03-08 07:20:00,2587,"Very nice, but no real surprise, Ron's a great guy and always ready to help  and that's a beauty fish too  Maureen"
772511,Handlebarz,2013-03-08 09:18:00,3790,Oh hell please stop we don't want Ronnie's head to explode.  Ah WTH you will not find a more passionate guy out there for the sport or standing up for the fishing rights if others. Ron for sure would help out anyone and a kid well that is his main goal have fun and keep them interested in our sport.  Congrats to your son and sorry about the pocket book for all the new gear your gonna buy.
772513,ChrisK,2013-03-08 10:21:00,2772,Sweet !! Cudo's to Ron for teaching your boy how to put that bugger out there and congrads on your sons first fish on his first drift on his own hand tied fly.
772677,Ron,2013-03-09 01:04:00,1683,"I was impressed on how quickly this young buck picked up on the fly rod. It's an older jem of an outfit with double taper fly line that needs some a lot of conditioning. I bet this outfit sat in their friends closet for over a dozen years. Needless to say I have never met a kid who was so grateful in getting a ""new to them"" outfit. There is still plenty of life left in this outfit and certainly another 500 or so fish to catch on it.  He's already talking about places he can utilized this on ""Opener"".  Congrats to JT for getting such a keen interest in fishing. I think he just might be a chip off the ol block. (2 oclock load 10 oclock load....)  No need to thank me guys, I'm sure anyone on here would do the same for a person who was tempting to learn a new technique.  Cheers, Ron..."
772680,buckster,2013-03-09 01:18:00,530,Wow... First drift!  Good stuff!  Congrats on getting a fish on your own fly! WTG Ron for taking the time to teach the young fella.   It can be a tough crowd down there sometimes lol. Glad he ran into the right guy!
772689,BillM,2013-03-09 01:59:00,17367,"Kid is ruined, he's not addicted to steelheading"
772706,Ron,2013-03-09 06:22:00,1683,He's been addicted to River fishing for several years already. He's been running a float reel for at least 3 years now.
772710,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-09 08:26:00,8243,"Hey Ron, your a beauty for sure. good on you, now if you have the time you might want to show me how. The first and last time I tried to throw a line with my fishing partners flyrod I caught a willow tree, a birch ( heck had to go 40 feet or so) a dock and a canoe. unfortunately the canoe was not within the slot size."
