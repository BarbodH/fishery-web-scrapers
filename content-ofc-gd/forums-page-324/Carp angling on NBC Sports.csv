772620,capt bruce,2013-03-08 20:24:00,820,"Goes to show ya , you may be the uglest fish in the swim , but if you got a big dorsel ya goona get the chicks chaseing ya.Glad to see these fish getting respect , 20 + pound fish , fight like tanks , catch and release they withstand far better than most fish . And you dont need a high priced boat or high priced gear (but if you are so inclined there is lots of expencive carp gear out there , for the gear guys ) a can of corn , a hook ,a weight and allmost any river ,lake or pond and your good to go . I have taken lots of die hard steelies and salmon guys down to Assbridges bay in T.O. and you should see the looks on their faces when they are hooked up to a 20 pound Carp . Keep up the good work about getting fishing for these out there ."
