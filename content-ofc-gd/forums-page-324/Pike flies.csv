771557,dhickey,2013-03-04 01:40:00,1038,Ill take 4 if you can put a floating head on them kinda like a popper? 2 at 5 inch 2 at 7 inch. Im going out May long weekend. Dont forget about the wolly.  Awsum work young man
771569,Christopheraaron,2013-03-04 02:11:00,3525,I'll send you a PM about it dawg
771573,Nightsky,2013-03-04 02:23:00,15,I was talking with a guy at Sail the other day about making popper flies. He told me he's using epoxy glue to coat the popper head.
771575,Christopheraaron,2013-03-04 02:25:00,3525,"Ok, thanks night. I was thinking of trying some of that UV head cement, thoughts?"
771625,DundasSteelheader,2013-03-04 04:47:00,166," UV head cement is pretty expensive.. about 8 bucks for a little bottle if I remember correctly. You can get a lot of regular epoxy for that. When I did my last bunch of poppers I just dipped the foam heads in enamel paint and got that nice glossy shiny head you see on the store bought ones. Never tried using balsa before.  Good luck, flies look good"
771646,Christopheraaron,2013-03-04 11:54:00,3525,"Ok, I'll stick with the epoxy then, thanks!"
772758,azebra,2013-03-09 17:03:00,168,"rio steelhead/salmon fly line for all my steelhead salmon pike and bass fishing.. its wf, with a bullet style taper, witch meand it turns over big air resistant flies. and a long head for easy mending.."
771294,woodenboater,2013-03-02 14:51:00,2277,nice work Chris
771298,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 15:51:00,3525,"Ok, here's one for the bass guys  "
771330,Nightsky,2013-03-02 18:35:00,15,"love this one! Im gonna try to tie your zonker flies, but I will need the material first .. dont have any steel leader material yet."
771332,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 18:56:00,3525,"You shouldn't need any leader material, just tie the rabbit in twice"
771335,Nightsky,2013-03-02 19:12:00,15,"well need some material to tie both hooks together, I could use 30lbs mono but ill be fishing pike mostly and that could snap off kinda easily"
771344,BillM,2013-03-02 19:44:00,17367,"Chris, how big is that last brown one, with the yellow eyes?"
771352,Handlebarz,2013-03-02 20:03:00,3790,Great looking flies for sure very nice work. I loved fly fishing pike and bass in Sudbury but would get broken off alot from pike I had to light of equipment back then.  Keep at it your on the right track Chris.
771356,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 20:28:00,3525,"Thanks, nightsky I think you're looking at something else than what I was thinking"
771357,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 20:31:00,3525,"Bill, it's probably about 6-7"".  Here it is next to my bobbin  This is what I was thinking of night, not the whole fly, just how you tie in your rabbit.http://business.virgin.net/flyfishing.flies/zonker-olive.html"
771378,Andrew Grant,2013-03-02 23:01:00,201,.
771379,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 23:10:00,3525,"That one is a size 2, I can make bigger ones, probably want a stinger with that too. Pm me and we can work something out"
771383,bare foot wader,2013-03-02 23:26:00,1354,"sweet looking intruder....google the prom dress, lots of different variations like any pattern, effective fly where you're gonna be fishing (pretty much anywhere really)  PS props to those barbless hooks I see there, good stuff"
771385,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 23:31:00,3525,"That's a sweet looking fly barefoot! The hooks actually aren't barbless, they're kind of a hybrid between barbless and barbed, look closely and you'll see. Still better than a full barb"
771386,bare foot wader,2013-03-02 23:35:00,1354,"yep, the prom dress is the fly fishermans equivalent to a spinner/spoon...swing and hold on!  gotcha, those hooks have more of a hump than a barb right? on my phone so cna't see too closely"
771387,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 23:38:00,3525,"ya, harms the fish less but it still stays on"
771399,BITEME,2013-03-03 00:23:00,1968,Nice stuff!!!!!!!!!!
771423,Tim Mills,2013-03-03 04:09:00,476,Here are some basic flies that I have tied for Pike. What do use guys recommend for leader material when flyfishing for pike?  I usually use heavy flouro tippet.  Does anyone use Tuff Line Tufleader (braided stainless steel but apparently ties like mono)?    They're not pretty but they fool some of the hammer handles at Mountsberg. Pike seem to swallow the fly quite often.  I like to pinch the barbs to increase the odds of a successfull release. 
771427,bare foot wader,2013-03-03 04:43:00,1354,"any fly in general doesn't need to be pretty (don't tell the dry fly elitists that ha), especially pike flies though  I use either thick mono/fluor or the Rio wire tippet in 20/30lb for leader...it ties well, usually still use a small snap but sometimes tie a loop knot...albright knot to attach tippet to leader  if you get into tying some larger stuff, synthetic materials don't absorb water they way a ""half chicken"" fly does and pick up and cast easier  barbless all the way, all my pike lures are barbless, haven't looked back  only thnk about those long streamer hooks is they have a small gap and long shank, leads to more shake offs...mustad makes a great long shank, wide gap saltwater streamer hook, perfect for pike  details on those pliers? do they float?"
771473,Tim Mills,2013-03-03 16:13:00,476," BPS brand, they do float and work ok but the the line cutter is not very effective.  If your not concerned about them floating Dollarama sells good needle nose pliers that work well."
771474,azebra,2013-03-03 16:38:00,168,"those look really nice! good job! I suggest you tie on a stinger hook! I've lost some takes and visually watched a pike grab my streamer by the tail turn and never hook up. so I tie 20lb wire and have the hook point just shy of the end of the fly. it helps a lot,  use a heavy guage hook, I forget what mine are but their a number 6 salt water type hook, I think."
771482,adempsey,2013-03-03 18:09:00,1498,"I haven't done a ton of fly fishing for Pike, but when I do I use TyGer or Cortland Toothy Critter leader.   Worked great, but I haven't landed any trophies yet.  I also have some of the Tuf-Line, but haven't used it yet;.  The flies I have ""tied"" - which are simple Maribou, bunny strip and flash combinations - I used 7/0 and 8/0 O'Shaughnessy hooks.  I also picked up some Partridge Ad Swier 6/0 pike hooks and was using those most recently.  Although, my monstrosities look like they would be more for Tarpon or Musky than Pike, lol."
771501,kemper,2013-03-03 20:16:00,2232,"What rods and lines do you guys use to chuck these big flies?  I have an 8 weight that doesn't like to toss anything much bigger than 2""...  My fly fishing is mostly limited to rivers, and while I could fire some huge flies with the Spey rod it isn't the most practical idea when in a boat on a lake.  Weight forward, big shooting heads?"
771504,bare foot wader,2013-03-03 20:23:00,1354,"I use a rio outbound line, it's meant to have a shooting head on it but I just run straight 20lb to my leader/fly, works well  also overline 1 wt using the rio pike line, my rod is a fast action 9wt, handles the overline nicely  tying the big flies with synthetic materials helps reduce the amount of water they suck up, pick up and punch better  I use a 9wt switch rod a lot, cast a mile overhand and hanldes big stuff good  I also have a cross current 13/14 i bust out now and then lol"
771508,Christopheraaron,2013-03-03 20:58:00,3525,This will be my first year and I'm planning on using the Spey
771534,Christopheraaron,2013-03-03 23:56:00,3525,"Ok, started doing some balsa poppers as well and I've been using head cement to seal them, it seems to work but I was wondering what everyone else uses to coat it?"
771204,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 02:19:00,3525,"I've been tying pike flies for the last couple weeks, they started out a little rough but they're starting to get pretty good. Any pointers? Suggestions?    These last two are double articulated and each about 7"" long, really fun to tie.  "
771206,Joeytier,2013-03-02 02:27:00,3990,Those look great.  Do any of them have bead heads?  I can see smaller versions of those working great for spring brookies as well.
771208,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 02:31:00,3525,"Thanks, none with bead or cone heads, yet. The first double articulated one does have some dumbell eyes though."
771210,bare foot wader,2013-03-02 02:32:00,1354,"great looking flies man...2nd and 4th are my favourite, but they'd all catch fish  but wait a minute, where are those intruders? lol  have you tried tying any with mono/wire weed guards  I really like tying pike tube flies these days, I find less shake offs and a lot of times the fly will slide up the leader (like a plastic worm does) and doesn't get shredded quite so fast"
771211,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 02:37:00,3525,"LOL, don't worry I'm tying them too. Here's proof  Also I'll try some tubes.  "
771212,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-02 02:37:00,10439,Tie some big bunny leeches with lead eyes or cone heads.          Make sure you tie some chartreuse ones.    They catch fish like this!!!!     
771213,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 02:38:00,3525,Nice Dave!
771214,Moosebunk,2013-03-02 02:45:00,3970,"They're looking cool Chris.  Like Dave says, if too big, bulky and light you'll want to add some dumbbell eyes or wraps of lead around the hook shanks to make those flies fly a little easier.  The rabbit zonker strips, marabou and bucktail is likely all the material you'll ever need... as they make flies that just come to life in the water.  Tie some more white... white/and a little red, chartreuse/red, and black/orange."
771222,kemper,2013-03-02 03:11:00,2232,"Tie that first one on an intruder shank, and I'd swing it for bows...  Nice flies"
771229,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 03:17:00,3525,"Cool, that one is about 5"", think I should tie it a bit smaller?"
771233,kemper,2013-03-02 03:31:00,2232," 5"" is a little on the big side, but certainly not out of the questions especially on bigger systems.  Most of my ""big"" spey patterns come in around 4""."
771236,dhickey,2013-03-02 03:34:00,1038,Now that is worth giving a try. A slightly bigger head on it? Floating.  Theese look great.. Keep it up
771237,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 03:39:00,3525,"Thanks dawg, that ones probably a little big for these waters but its for BC anyways"
771249,Nightsky,2013-03-02 06:10:00,15,Very nice flies indeed! I started to tie some as well .. done my first 3 flies (which are technically my first 3 flies ever too lol)
771250,Nightsky,2013-03-02 06:12:00,15,Trying to find a way to post the picture but this site isnt like most places it seems .. cant just attach something?
771251,Nightsky,2013-03-02 06:16:00,15,http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?app=gallery&image=7856  Wondering if this will work .. ill have to find a way to be able to post picture right in the post
771252,Nightsky,2013-03-02 06:20:00,15,"There we go, found it I think "
771253,Nightsky,2013-03-02 06:24:00,15,All 3 have weedguards made with 30lbs mono.
771254,adempsey,2013-03-02 06:31:00,1498,"They look as good as several that I have purchased, especially the first one."
771269,misfish,2013-03-02 10:26:00,29133,"I can see I,ll need to bring extra cash to the Hamilton swap.LOL  Nice work."
771284,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 13:32:00,3525,"Thanks everyone! Nightsky, those aren't bad for your firsts! Try and fold the hackle back and maybe tie that second one like a zonker style fly (just google it and you'll see what I mean"
771285,davey buoy,2013-03-02 13:37:00,5505,"Nice flies guys,must be very rewarding!"
771289,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 13:58:00,3525,"It is Davey, even just to look at them  and just a reminder, I'll have lots of pike bass, and some trout flies at the Hamilton tackle swap"
771290,Christopheraaron,2013-03-02 13:59:00,3525,"Braden is also giving me some t shirts, rods and flies to sell as well"
