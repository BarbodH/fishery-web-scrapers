772974,glen,2013-03-10 18:00:00,2641,Congrats on a great fish. So your truck is a portable hut eh. Nice to see you remembered more the a handful is a waste and let that one go.
773031,Rod Caster,2013-03-10 22:47:00,5784,"Thanks again all. My truck has been my best fishing buddy for the past two years.  During winter, I keep on average two under-slot fish per week which equals two walleye meals for the wife and I.  We need no more and wouldn't want any less.  Only one week left on Nipissing for this winter!"

772864,Rod Caster,2013-03-10 01:32:00,5784,"Only two fish caught tonight on Nipissing , which is really odd. Missed three big fish in a row, then finally landed this one. 8.5lbs on scale , estimating 27.5 to 28""  "

772932,mike rousseau,2013-03-10 13:25:00,4661,Sweet catch man....
772933,Rod Caster,2013-03-10 13:29:00,5784,"Actually caught it with the rod you see in the pic...just a small northland ice rod...it's sitting in my holder in the photo. Was using a Dartees spoon and minnow tipper.  I was thinking the same thing. When this girl bit, there must have been a school of big ones cruising around because I had three in a row slam my lure and I played them too quick and lost them, definitly wasn't the same fish everytime because I had them right up to the ice before they slipped off. I was sure it was a bunch of greasy ling haha.  Thanks! Anything over the slot goes back down the hole for me. My frying pan isn't big enough for such a big filet haha."
772935,lew,2013-03-10 13:32:00,12766,Great catch and congrats on the PB !!
