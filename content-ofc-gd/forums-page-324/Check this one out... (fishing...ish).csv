772851,kemper,2013-03-10 01:01:00,2232,"Was out this morning before sun up washing some baits, and I snapped a few shots of the sunrise with my iPhone.  This was the best of the batch, it's a little grainy because it's only a cell camera after all but what caught my eye was the streak in the top left corner.  Shooting star? Yes/No?    Cheers."
772852,BillM,2013-03-10 01:02:00,17367,"Yup, looks like it."
772854,spincast,2013-03-10 01:05:00,3279,nice view
772856,danc,2013-03-10 01:06:00,4677,How long was the exposure? Looks like a commercial jet vapour trail to me. It's lit up from the sun coming over the horizen. I doubt if something as high as a shooting star would light up from the sun like that.
772858,Rod Caster,2013-03-10 01:09:00,5784,I'll say commercial jet. Is that a new moon on the far right side?
772861,captpierre,2013-03-10 01:20:00,2521,we're supposed to ge seing a comet at some point.  I thought it is only visible in the southern hemisphere at this point

772869,BillM,2013-03-10 01:45:00,17367,"That seems awful vertical for an airplane...  Kemper, if you can tell us the iso/exposure time it will be very easy to figure out if that's a plane or not."
772870,irishfield,2013-03-10 01:51:00,26272,"That's not vertical... flying level by the looks of it.. around 18,000 feet. ;O)"
772871,danc,2013-03-10 01:53:00,4677,"Looks pretty horizontal from my view Bill. Commercial jet imho. Also, the fading trail is a dead give away. I don't know if seeing a jet and a vapour trail is something rare in Southern Ontario, but up here we see them dozens of times a day, if you're looking for them."
