During first ice on the St. Marys River and Lake Superior I was targeting whitefish on micro jigs and wax worms.    Next up was fishing the weedy bays on the lower parts of the St. Marys River. I really enjoy running and gunning for panfish and setting tip-ups for big gators. Plus the good eats is a bonus!                                I snuck a trip in for lakers during family day weekend in feb. Spent the weekend fishing, eating and drinking with a few buddies from southern Ontario. Whats better than that?!       Next up was my first trip into LSPP. Since we have been dumped on this year I have stayed right out of the park waiting for better conditions. We were not greeted with prime conditions but good enough for an easy hike into a splake/lake trout lake.    Hit a river mouth about a week ago looking for my first steelhead of the season. What a battle on an ice rod!    Just the other day I was up on Superior looking for my perch fix when this bad boy hit! My first Lake Superior walleye.....    I hope everyone has enjoyed the winter months as much as I have. Be careful on the late ice and good luck with the rest of your ice season!  TDunn"
