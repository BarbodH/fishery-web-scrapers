772371,Luke V.,2013-03-07 15:47:00,286,I am looking for a better option for storing rods in my boat. Running a 14' Star Craft split bench at the rear. This boat comes with the plastic 2 rod holders on each side.  I am looking to remove the current rod holders and add something that can accommodate 4-5 rods on each side.  Has anyone used these?  http://www.basspro.com/Attwood-Vertical-Mount-Rod-Holder/product/10211296/   Was then thinking of using a strap or these the for the tip end   Does anyone know where i could buy something similar to these?  thanks for your help tight lines Luke

772435,mcdougy,2013-03-08 00:05:00,274,It sounds like we have the same boat?  2 sets of splits and full bench at front? live well and storage in the middle splits?  What size engine are you using to push yours? And ae you pleased with H.P.    Im wondering if im underpowered or if smart tabs will help?  Cheers   Matt
772456,Luke V.,2013-03-08 01:18:00,286,Mine has the split bench at the back and then two benches. No livewell no floor. Powered with a Merc 25 SeaPro. Had an old 80's Johnson 20 before that. Have never felt underpowered. Runs 27 mph with just me in it
