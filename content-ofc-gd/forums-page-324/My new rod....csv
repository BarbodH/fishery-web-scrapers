771934,Garry2Rs,2013-03-05 16:18:00,1425,"I'm working on one more rod, before I pack-up my toys to head home. The rod blank is my all-time favourite casting rod, the MB843. It's a 7ft. medium heavy for 1/4 to 3/4 oz. baits. To spice it up a bit, I did a little different type of tiger wrap and some fancy cutting and gluing on the grip. I don't know about anyone else, but I like the split-grip, no fore-grip look.   Details...      This one is for me, and I look foreward to water testing it soon. Garry"
771939,Ralph Field,2013-03-05 17:31:00,1018,Looks great !
771964,davey buoy,2013-03-05 20:13:00,5505,Very nice Garry!!!
771973,Garry2Rs,2013-03-05 21:02:00,1425,"Thanks Guys! This afternoon, I ordered the guides.  I'm planning a spiral wrap with 10, 8 and 6's. I did the same blank, last Fall, using a spiral of 10, 8, 6 and #4 mini's. That rod works fine, but the larger guides will accommodate the bigger knots when I attach a heavy leader for Pike in May.

772108,manjo39,2013-03-06 15:58:00,354,Nice looking rod. I'm also jealeous of the lemon tree in your backyard!
772163,davey buoy,2013-03-06 19:57:00,5505,"Hey Garry,with that rear extension how long is that rod from the reel?.I know the leverage part,but that rod would be under 6' unless I'm missing something."
772165,NAW,2013-03-06 20:04:00,4022,I know nothing about building rods.  Does having them near fresh lemon tree's help somehow?
772203,Angler management,2013-03-06 23:21:00,280,"I would kill for one of those!!!  How much would it cost to get a fancy custom rod like that built?? Want to get one for my old man as a gift, but dont have the time, knowledge or skill for something like that. I would just waste the money and ruin the product, but i know it would bring tears to his eyes as a retirement gift!"
772211,Garry2Rs,2013-03-06 23:44:00,1425,"N.A.W. In March, having it near a lemon tree helps a lot, if you are turning the cork outside...grin.  Good call Davey! The blank was 84 inches long.  It was going to have a 10"" handle with the center of the reel seat at 72 inches. However the parts turned out a little larger than I expected. The choice was to cut them down, or spread them out for aesthetics."
772387,jace,2013-03-07 17:29:00,472,"nice cup of lemonade, sir.  mb843 is one of my favorites too, in IMX, but all models were nearly impossible to find after shimano took over 15 yrs ago."
772388,mistaredone,2013-03-07 17:33:00,913,Nice job!  Looks great
