772510,lickmyarmpit,2013-03-08 08:19:00,359,Just bought a new boat this year that is allot more big water ready.  I'm looking at getting a couple combos for trolling dipseys and running planer boards. Hopefully I can use the same combos for muskies any idea what I should be looking for this type of fishing is all new to me and any info would be appreciated.
