772554,kemper,2013-03-08 15:05:00,2232,"My name is Braden and I have a problem.  I have more fishing rods than I can reasonably store in my rod locker, and I need more space.  Here's the situation:  I have a whack of personal fishing rods, and also have a whole bunch of custom jobs on the go. Currently I'm storing the customs in my bedroom, because I don't want to leave them in the workshop (dust in the wraps, accidentally knocked over etc).  I'm looking for a storage solution that will hold 20-30 rods of various lengths, some finished and others unfinished. It needs to be able to fit in a room with a standard height roof.  Alternatively, if it's a closed storage system (doors, some type of cover maybe) it can go in the shop where there is lots more space and roof height.  So lets hear it, how do you store your rods?"

772569,kemper,2013-03-08 16:08:00,2232,A whack of Poly tubing should do the trick indeed...  Thanks TJ
