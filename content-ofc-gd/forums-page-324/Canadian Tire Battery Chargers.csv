772642,captpierre,2013-03-08 21:59:00,2521,CT has 2 chargers on sale 50% off.  Both Eliminator brand.  6/4/2A Intelligent Charger($30)  and a 25/12/4A  Intelligent Charger with 75A engine start and battery desulfation($60)  Thinking of getting the latter  as a charger and booster for a dead battery  Are these any good?  Worth buying?  peter
772654,fish_fishburn,2013-03-08 22:56:00,1311,Cant help you Capt. Ihave had poor luck with CT batts and Chargers over the years. When in doubt look at where it's made. This helps in deciding if i'm buying or not.
772669,jedimaster,2013-03-09 00:41:00,3472,I haven't had much luck at all with canadian tire chargers  it seems like every time I need one I am buying another one.
772707,Gerry,2013-03-09 06:23:00,257,"I've had very poor luck with Can Tire chargers. In fact, I cooked 2 very good deep cycle batteries with one recently. Never again will I buy anything from Can Tire that requires it to be plugged in. I now own a couple of CTEK chargers and these work quite well."
772722,wormdunker,2013-03-09 11:32:00,1711,"I recently purchased a ""battery tender plus"".  75.00.  They are a slow trickle charge that also maintains your battery after being fully charged.  They will not over charge your baterry.  Works very well.  Plug it in & walk away.  Unplug it in 4 days if you wish.  Your battery will not be damaged."
772725,fishindevil,2013-03-09 11:36:00,6254,"I have 2 top of the line chargers from Canadian tire and have had a few of them over the years and have never had a problem with any of them I have acid ally worn a few out from just being used 100""s I times and they have payed for themselves for sure the new one I got 2 years ago had many options and de-sulfates the battery and does many different things !!!!! So I will continue to buy them no problems !!!!! Just sayin"
772728,Steve,2013-03-09 11:56:00,2075,"the issue with canadian tire chargers is the new ""smart"" digital ones.   i still use two of the old ones with the simple four button, and the analog display..work like a charm.   i went to buy a backup, it was an intellicharge digital one...cooked my battery.   have to take a close look at which one your buying.  i use the one shown here. one in black, one in blue. (not my photo)  "
772729,Cosmos,2013-03-09 12:25:00,588,"I am using charger and maintainer from CT. Both are good, both are Motomaster and were purchased on 50% sale."
772732,bigugli,2013-03-09 13:32:00,6138,I also have an older Nautilus charger that has been great over the past 10 years.
