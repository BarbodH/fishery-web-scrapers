772887,Tim Mills,2013-03-10 03:04:00,476,We did this canoe camping trip to Massassauga PP in the Parry Sound area a couple of years ago.  They have interior lake sites (no gas motors) if you canoe or kayak.  If you want to camp with your boat and motor they also have sites on Georgian Bay.  If your looking for summer camping options in the near north this may be a good option for some of you.  My nephew Joe and my kids Reilly and Jack.      Pike Troll     site 19 spider lake          My younger boys Jack and Goldwater     pike site 17 area    view from site 19    Topwater Largemouth site 21 area      site 19 looking north       Reilly with a typical Massassauga PP pike     A short but good trip.

772897,Canuck,2013-03-10 03:25:00,491,Great park. I boat in from the south 2 or 3 times a summer and stay overnight or a couple days. Fishing is good and lots of places to try.

A tip for your next trip, bring an aluminum extension pole and a 2x2 that is a foot long and drill a hole in the middle to hold the tip of the pole. Put your picnic table in the centre of the tarp and put the pole in the middle. When it rains you have the perfect shelter!"
