770610,phatpelkey,2013-02-27 20:42:00,78,"i have been looking at musky lure storage ideas, so far they all seem way overpriced, so my question is has any of you made your own homemade storage boxes for you bull dawgs, double dawgs, pounders or jakes before? if so could u possibly post up a pic to give me a few ideas? ps: im a shore fisherman, so would have to be some what light weight and fit into a trunk of a car  thanks"
770613,Raf,2013-02-27 20:53:00,3495,a pail works good.  you dont need to bring as many baits as you think you do.
770615,phatpelkey,2013-02-27 20:57:00,78,i tried the pail but in my car kept falling over and tangling together wasnt fun
770616,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-27 21:02:00,10439,I'll take pics of mine for you tonight. It's pretty decent and might work for you. Doesn't see much use now with the lack of muskies in the arctic. I guess it could come out for the giant pike though.

770618,lew,2013-02-27 21:05:00,12766,Lotsa cheap alternatives for carrying big baits.  Plastic storage  box with  wire hangers works well    An old bag with pieces of square downspouts cut to length    You can even put the downspouts in your livewell.    Or if you've got some lumber laying around it's pretty simple to make up a cheap box and rig it with some wire to hold baits.      You can even hang them on your boat    
770630,BucktownAngler,2013-02-27 22:03:00,582,lew you thought of everything
770646,phatpelkey,2013-02-27 22:53:00,78,"that down spout idea is great im going to price out some plastic down spout next time i run into town, thanks"
770651,pidge,2013-02-27 23:07:00,438,"Oh boy thats a smart idea of using the plastic down spouts, very resourceful. I use to keep mine piled in an old shoe box...crappy idea. If you have a Princess Auto around your area I'd recomende heading there. They always have some sorta bag or carrying case of some kind that may tickle your fancy. Good luck."
770652,Live2fish85,2013-02-27 23:13:00,1633,"This is what I use, Dax made a post last year. I made one and it works like a charm. It is full now so I screwed the handle on both ends and it works perfect.   "
770658,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-27 23:29:00,10439,I have one of those without the down-spouts for my T-60 flatfish. Probably have 40 or 50 of them in there.
771090,LucG,2013-03-01 17:45:00,779,"Well like others, I have used a reg tackle bag, and inserted pieces to make what you see. Kind of like the inside of a case of beer. I used an old election sign I had found. Itâ€™s a thick corrugated plastic. The corrugation has perfect little holes to place your hooks.      "
771109,Handlebarz,2013-03-01 19:47:00,3790,"Adam home hardware on Keil drive has the stuff you want it's around $20 a section just cut it to 10"" lengths and you will get 12 sections you can fit 2 bulldogs in each tube or 4-7 bucktails or 2 jakes 3 double D's. you can get alot of baits into them.  What I used was for a bag was the soft sided cooler bags from CTC they go on sale all the time I use both sizes 48 can cooler bag and 96 can cooler bag the bigger one is the size of the large $200 musky bags out there you can build it for $60."
771113,davey buoy,2013-03-01 20:15:00,5505,"Great ideas,I use a pail to hold about 8 off the lip.That plastic downspout idea is the cats  from what I see.!"
771114,Handlebarz,2013-03-01 20:17:00,3790,"Here are a couple pics Adam. I also cut a 1/4"" plywood for the bottom do the hooks don't get stuck into the bag   "
771116,ch312,2013-03-01 20:48:00,1590,  that same idea works very well for carrying bottles of pop on the ATV
771119,jedimaster,2013-03-01 21:14:00,3472,Do they still make pop bottles....
771400,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-03 00:25:00,10439,Finally got the pics of my box taken.      
772109,phatpelkey,2013-03-06 16:02:00,78,"well i made me my musky box last night, tell me what you think   "
772116,lew,2013-03-06 16:18:00,12766,Excellent job on the box !!  The muskies don't care if your gear is fancy or not.
772136,Ron,2013-03-06 17:59:00,1683,"Looks great. I did very similar only I went to the local lumber yard, got them to band the pieces of trough together. This way you can loose the 4 loose ones on the right and put a plano box with your terminal tackle in it's place. This will give you a spot for your extra hooks, leaders, swivels, etc...."
772184,Handlebarz,2013-03-06 21:53:00,3790,Ron not all of us have access to lumber yard equipment. Next thing you will be telling us is they cut your firewood into perfect little prices? Yeah ok Hollywood  Great job Adam
772202,Angler management,2013-03-06 23:17:00,280,You guys have wayyyy too much musky lures... Lol
772230,Rich Clemens,2013-03-07 00:27:00,3131,"  Exactly what I had used for several years.  What I found was that you need both hands to carry it, so it meant more trips back and forth to the boat.  I also found that I never used even a quarter of the baits I had in it.   I ended up buying a carrying case from BPS that held 4 storage boxes and fuilled it up with my most commonly used baits.   Nice shoulder strap - so both hands are free to carry rods or something else."
772414,ch312,2013-03-07 21:04:00,1590," jones soda. coincidentally, they're the same size as beer bottles."
