Since the upgrade to photobucket, that method doesnt seem to work. Anyone else experiencing this? Anybody who can point me to a solution?"

772437,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-08 00:11:00,10439,Yes it's changed. You now click on the little cog/gear in the top right of the thumbnail. Then on the menu that comes up click on get links.
772441,fishindevil,2013-03-08 00:26:00,6254,Is that for mobile or pc ?? I always use my iPhone to upload my pics to ofc from photobucket and it's always been great ... So why would they change it when there was never any issues with it?? Grrrr figures eh.....
772452,bigugli,2013-03-08 01:04:00,6138,They've made a lot of changes to various formats. Most annoying are the continuous stream of adds that follow each upload. They also removed the bulk upload that allowed a group a pics at once.

Then somehow I was able to switch back to the old photobucket.  Wish I could tell you how, but I honestly can't remember???  original photobucket was 10X better IMO"
772675,spincast,2013-03-09 01:03:00,3279,"yeah, I did that for a while - but they dont support that anymore - have ou tried using (uploading or linking to pictures ) it lately? ended up spending a lot of time on the ""how do ...?I"" page. definitely  not an improvement - kinda like vista compared to xp....."
