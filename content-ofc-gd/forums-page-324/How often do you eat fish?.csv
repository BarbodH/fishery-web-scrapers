As I got older and when fresh fish and all kinds of seafood , with the new fast transport methods came available from all over , fish  (seafood),the ones I catch and the ones I can buy at St lawerance market or Kensinton , became more and more the go to food in my house , All 4 of my children love fish . We still eat our share of vension , moose , duck , and geese , with wild turkey on the menu if me or one of my sons gets lucky . And like I said a great big beef T-bone now and than but red meat bought from the gocery store  I find just does not do it for me anymore . Char up some thick tuna steaks (agressively cook  ) on the barbe keeping them red in the middle , doesn't get any better .."
772374,danbouck,2013-03-07 16:37:00,4380,Maybe 10 times per year. I usually give my catch away to family.

772378,torco,2013-03-07 16:54:00,656,couple times a week
772384,Joeytier,2013-03-07 17:14:00,3990,"2 to 3 times a week, sometimes more...rarely less"
772391,Hooked,2013-03-07 17:46:00,891," Same here, infact I mixed some fish I baked last night in my home made stir-fry I'm eating now.  Just love eating fish...all kinds."
772394,jimmer,2013-03-07 18:07:00,2730,"Couple of times a month. Wow, some of you eat a lot of fish. No wonder I can't catch any! LOL"
772398,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-07 18:35:00,8243," In my opinion a mix of shellfish and freshwater makes the best fish soup. I make an Italian "" Brodetto"" which loosely translated simply means stew. A bit tricky when the freshwater fish is added. The softer the flesh the later you add the fish, otherwise you end up with a consistency like boiled canned tuna, not good. The white flesh freshwater fish seems to work best for me. I never use any of the salmonoid species in the Brodetto, comes out very strong for me. Pike is a good quality flesh to start then walleye and perch last. Don't forget the crusty bread toasted and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil to dip.  Gee thanks for bringing it up, now I'm hungry and could miss a meal or 2 after this long winter. If you guys and gals want I'll post a recipe."

772402,misfish,2013-03-07 19:46:00,29133,Tonights menu is clams and lingunni.
772408,Lip-ripper,2013-03-07 20:37:00,228, I'd also like to try a recipe.  I had Piranha soup in South America once and it was awesome.  Haven't had fish soup since but I'd love to try it again. (not going to be buying pirahna at the pet store for soup tho... lol)

772412,Christopheraaron,2013-03-07 20:41:00,3525, Doesn't get any better.
772430,Acountdeleted,2013-03-07 23:50:00,2562,"Depends on the time of year. Over the summer a can of tuna is a quick snack at work. I like to have sushi once a week as my treat and, if I can, I love having my catch once a week as well (perch, walleye etc).  If mercury poisioning didn't exsist, fish would be all I'd ever eat."
772709,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-09 08:08:00,8243,"OK folks I'm going to attempt to write a fish soup recipe here for all to share, not give a cooking lesson. It' late and well,,,,, it's late. And I have a tendency to digress I'll try to stay on point, my wife is howling right now. I hope it turns out, I think I'm set up for members to email me or just ask a question here and I'll try and answer it as best that I can. Before we start the first thing I learned from my Italian Noni when she started teaching me to cook around the age of 5  was you can always add salt but it's difficult to remove it once it's in there. Even harder to remove hot pepper. This should serve 6 to 8 for sure, or 2 bowls for one of my buddys referred to as ""Sun Don't Shine"", played CFL and he's called that because where ever he walks the sun don' shine behind him. before we make our "" Brodetto "" the consistency can be from a thinner soup to a thicker stew, cook longer and I've used it on anything from Angel hair to Fettuccine pasta. It can be served on a large 3x5 foot board of plywood with 2"" thick polenta (cornmeal). The first time I had it with polenta was when Mrs. Trevisani served it to Mario and I and it was a out of body experience. Just remember the freshwater fish can't go in too early. I started using freshwater fish and substituted less expensive shellfish. Everything thing listed here is best fresh. sometimes it is just impossible to find fresh or the cost is too high. Fresh if possible,  Things we will need;  Let me check, yes that's it. I didn't mention it before but you could add potatoes cut and peeled into small 3/4 inch or larger now. It adds thickness to the Brodetto and a depth of texture as well.  once you have the consistency you want add the pike, carefully. Get it just below the stock to cook, only takes 10 mins or so on a rolling simmer, covered, after the Pike has been in for 10 mins. check carefully for fork tenderness, if done lay the walleye in. 10 minutes covered, also add scallops. Taste for salt heat. now we add the perch and shrimp, maybe 10 mins once shrimp is pink check for fork flakiness of the perch. taste for salt and heat.  to serve carefully remove the freshwater fish with 2 spatullas, set aside in a separate plate. Dole out a bowl of soup and place a piece of each species of each fish on top of each bowl. make sure every bowl has at least 2 cherrystone clams and 2 muscles etc. Then drizzle some olive oil on the top of the soup. again it can be served on top of any long strand pasta with the fish set on top last.  Toast thinly sliced Calabrese bread or chibatta buns, drizzle olive oil on the crustini also known as bruschetta which are all fancy words for, are you ready, toast.  I think that's it, if there are any ingredients left over I guess we didn't need it. Almost forgot, chop Basil lay on Brodetto and drink the rest of the wine and enjoy.  Johnny D"

772170,Rod Caster,2013-03-06 21:12:00,5784,"over the past year I averaged probably two to three servings per week... mostly perch, walleye, trout and relatively often pike, bass and ling. I will buy a slab of salmon/arctic char once in a while, but mostly I catch my fishy dinners.  In my small household, walleye is definitely our favorite although the wife is really keen on trout!  What's your fish-eating routine like? ( waiting for Bill to say ""Once this year""  )"

772179,Lip-ripper,2013-03-06 21:34:00,228,1-2 times per week. I never buy fish aside from the occasional can of tuna. Perch and Channel cats get fried. Walleye and whitefish gets fried or baked. Lake trout gets bbq'd or smoked. Specks get pan-fried in butter. Pike and Bass get released... lol
772183,misfish,2013-03-06 21:45:00,29133," Ya got that right Bruce.2-3 times a week. Don,t forget the pasta with them. Carbs.  I,m slowly getting back into eating fresh water catches. First was crappie,then that whitie last weekend. (with all the reports of dead ones,,It was hard to swallow it down)I,ll give the perch ago,,as soon as I can get a nice dozen eaters. But crappie are my fav. I only keep  a catch to eat that day. No more freezing ."

772200,Handlebarz,2013-03-06 23:15:00,3790,Your all sick in the head I don't eat that stuff fish is just small or big bait for more fish.  I actually don't like eating fish. I make alot of people happy when I got to fish fry's and they find out I'm not eating any.

772314,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-07 05:00:00,8243,"Getting low on supply, that's how I know spring is coming, soon I hope. Fresh water at least once a week, as well seafood once a week. Just had a perch dinner tonight. I estimate the cost of those yellows were about $125.00 a pound by the time we rented the hut at St. Williams for $50.00 each etc. And only bagged 2 keepers. Still worth every penny, Oh forgot no penny's any longer, worth every nickel. While on the topic, does anyone really go by the Ministry guidelines for suggested consumption? 2 meals a week are going above these suggested guidelines, for some species twice a week is double for what we should consume from Lake Erie according to the scientists, bless them all. For someone pregnant I would certainly want them to adhere to the guidelines."
