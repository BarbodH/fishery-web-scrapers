770660,Rod Caster,2013-02-27 23:44:00,5784,This was a great resource for northern ontario. Anyone know why it's been taken down? It's been at least two weeks since it has worked.
770679,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 00:36:00,10439,What did it do? Was it topo mapping or other?
770682,Rod Caster,2013-02-28 00:47:00,5784,"It showed portage routes, fish species, unammed lake ID's, areas of interest, township lines, park borders, access points, trails, snowmobiles trails etc etc. It might have shown land topo and select lake topo's as well. It was great for general recreational in Northern Ont.  I sent Geoma (the creating company) an email to see what they say and if it'll return... I'll hazard to guess that it relied on advertising and they were not making money on it."
770686,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 01:02:00,10439,This might be of some assistance to you if you don't already know of it. It is topo mapping for all of Canada and shows a lot to the stuff the site you're missing did. Check it out and let me know if it helps you out.  http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/toporama/index.html
770724,Rod Caster,2013-02-28 02:01:00,5784,"Great map Dave!  Some important-to-me features are missing, such as camping spots, Numbered Lakes and some fairly well-used portages. Crazy that it shows exposed rocks in lakes...although I can confirm it missed a few  I did just find an abandoned railway that I'd like to check out this summer. It's very useful map and just made me miss 10minutes of hockey. Saved to favorites."

772742,Snowball,2013-03-09 14:57:00,167,"Just tried NoMap.   It's back online!  Regards, Snowball"
772853,Rod Caster,2013-03-10 01:04:00,5784,I noticed that today too! Great news!
772860,Musky or Specks,2013-03-10 01:12:00,2710,"I like it I don't see this stuff though""Some important-to-me features are missing, such as camping spots"""
772862,Rod Caster,2013-03-10 01:26:00,5784,"your right, it doesn't show camping spots... I must have been thinking about one of my wall maps. Shows all the other things I mentioned however."
772924,fishindevil,2013-03-10 10:35:00,6254,It appears as it won't show much on an iPhone ?? Maybe it's not a mobile friendly site ?? Has anyone else tried from their phone to access the site and see the maps ??? Thanks
772938,Rod Caster,2013-03-10 13:36:00,5784,"it seems to show all the information on my BB, but due to the crappy browser on my phone, it doesn't navigate very nicely. I'd say it's more of a BB problem than a Nomap issue."
