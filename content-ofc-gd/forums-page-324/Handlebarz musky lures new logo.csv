772189,Handlebarz,2013-03-06 22:08:00,3790,Lmk when your back Ron I'm guessing you will be back before musky season? If so we might have to do some walleye.
772646,Wendel,2013-03-08 22:10:00,213,"Nice looking Logo Mike. Can't wait to put the sticker on my boat, I'm sure it will cover up a big ding lmao All kidding aside looking forward to getting some of these, maybe even a shirt.  Let me know when you have them, not sure I'm going to make it to the oddysey now. My sister in law decided to have my nephew Christened the same day, I get a month notice for that, but knew about the Oddysey a year ago, decisions decisions lol"

771946,BucktownAngler,2013-03-05 18:31:00,582,what colour are the shirts? are they tshirts only or sweaters also?
771956,Cosmos,2013-03-05 19:45:00,588,Very cool.
771974,Handlebarz,2013-03-05 21:19:00,3790,"Thanks again Guys  As for the shirts they will be black with white logo on the front it will be about 11"" diamiter. I can get sweat shirts but they will be limited to per sell only as they cost alot more to get in and he does not stock them so what I want I have to order he said I can order just 1 or 100 he will just have them sent with another order of shirts that was cool so I dont have to make a huge order. LMK Boss if you want one of them they would be Gilden hoodies with the white logo on the back.  As for the regluar shirts I have been toying with the ideas of words on the back any ideas weather to go this route or not? What I was thinking was my catch phrase Zing The Bling!!! across the upper shoulder area and maybey something written under neith about the lures or musky fishing but not to much.  Thanks again to Slowpoke for hooking me up with his friend and also to all the members who have tried to help me with a logo over the last 3 years."
