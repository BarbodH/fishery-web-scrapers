He is credited with authoring over 300 original songs and original is the word. Although Sudbury is the nickel town, we borrowed "" Sudbury Saturday Night "" as a theme song for Steelworkers in Hamilton. Replace Sudbury with Hamilton and boom, it sure described a lot of goings on in any hotel back then. Met Stompin Tom when he played the Jockey Club downwind of Stelco and Dofasco in the early 70's. After his set he was selling albums and 8 tracks from a card table set up in the corner. On the way back from a FLA. Road trip in 1976 stopped in Atlanta to visit some transplanted cousins from North Tonawanda NY. They asked  one evening if I had any Canuck music in my Ford Econoline van. Pulled out the 8 track case and popped in a Stompin Tom tape on my Muntz Quadraphonic 8 track 4 speaker system. Needless to say when I was back on the road the tape was missing and my cousin Ralph left me a note thanking me for the great country western music."

His three cord songs, his lyrics, all scream of times of old when values were things you learned; you did not buy. For many years, on Saturday mornings, you could hear Stompin Tom blasting out of our house. Saturday was cleaning day and all my wife had to do, was put on our copy of Stompin Tom, ""A proud Canadian"". The vacum seemed to work on it's own!

Ironically  friends of ours just flew back to Summerside 2 days ago after visiting up here for a week.  We played some of his songs around the campfire.
