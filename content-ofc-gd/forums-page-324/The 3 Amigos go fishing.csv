772492,limeyangler,2013-03-08 03:50:00,5204," The 'fish eye' view shots are stills taken with my new Gopro Hero3. The pictures with the thin red borders are stills taken from GoPro video footage which i altered using windows picture program, the rest are with my older trusty canaon point and shoot.  Definitely a few giggles were had.  LOL...ijust told him and he went all shy and hid under a blanket on the couch...mind you its well past his bedtime."
