159541,BENNY,2008-02-11 17:34:00,37,When it comes to changing the oil in a four stoke outboard how often should this be done? Does it depend on the size and or make of the engine?  Thanks
159542,Terry,2008-02-11 17:39:00,14456,well depending on the hours you run it but once a year is a good bet
159543,ccmtcanada,2008-02-11 17:39:00,7971, Should tell you right in the manual.  Most will tell you the schedule of regular maintenance items like that.  What year/make/model/HP motor do you have?
159544,irishfield,2008-02-11 17:40:00,26272,Once a year or  100 hours of operation. + one right after break in ...10 to 20 hours.. is a good idea.
159554,BENNY,2008-02-11 17:52:00,37,Thanks guys its on a boat I am picking up from the US finally found one. Its a 200 Yammy 4 stroke 2003 so already broken in.
159565,ccmtcanada,2008-02-11 18:20:00,7971,"Go to this site to download your manual....  http://www.yamaha-motor.com/outboard/servi...spx?ls=outboard  Just choose the year and model.  Here's the maintenance schedule for their 4 stroke 200hp....says after the break in period, change after 100 hours or 6 months.  "
159585,BENNY,2008-02-11 19:14:00,37,"Thanks, it was more of a curiosity question as he has all the manuals, I just thought I would ask as I knew someone on here would know."
160401,carll2,2008-02-14 02:02:00,443,"i use  f150 and f115s 4 stroke yams and normally i change the oil every 80 hours, but then again the boat is used  between 5-8hrs daily so  between 80-100 hrs per oil change is good"
