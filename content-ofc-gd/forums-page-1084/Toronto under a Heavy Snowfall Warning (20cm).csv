159848,ccmtcanada,2008-02-12 17:06:00,7971,"I woke up this morning, tuned into 680 news and they said that to the west of Toronto there was a heavy snowfall warning as lake effect snow would fall there before the main storm arrives at 4 or 5 this afternoon.  Based on that, I drove in...I would have normally just taken the train.  Anyways, by 9am it's snowing like crazy at Yonge/Eglinton.  They now changed it to say that the lake effect snow will shift further north to include Toronto/Pickering (no kidding...just look outside....LOL).  Anyhow, Toronto is now bracing for 20cm of snow ending by 2am.  Here's the warning from environment Canada.   Be safe everyone...leave lots of space out there, take your time and get home safe.

159862,lew,2008-02-12 17:44:00,12767," Same reason some folks buy gas by the litre, but go to the store and ask for a quart of milk.  And some of us still use the old imperial system for EVERYTHING Glen, just the way it's sposed to be  done"
159865,Terry,2008-02-12 17:54:00,14456,hmmmm I measure every thing in millimetres...makes it sound bigger
159897,mistyriver1,2008-02-12 19:11:00,600, I agree Lew.  Can't tell what good gas mileage is for a vehicle unless I hear how many miles per gallon it gets.    Terry
160059,irishfield,2008-02-13 04:41:00,26272,Anyone know how to drive down there?  Took my daughter from 9:30 to 10:30pm to drive from Carlton/Jarvis.. across bloor and down the ramp to the DVP North and then get back off again for Bloor/Bayview and head up Bayview. 50 minutes of it was from ramp to ramp on the DVP. Then just called me from the Wendy's on 400.. another hour to there. 2 hours to do a 20 minute trip. I should see her about 2 !
160065,motv8tr,2008-02-13 08:28:00,2587,"Wayne I can tell you from personal experience...very few people know how to drive in this stuff in Toronto.  I saw on the news that lots of people were spinning their wheels on the DVP trying to go uphill.  Should be fun at work today, none of the buses have Snow Tires  Maureen"
160083,mattyk,2008-02-13 12:06:00,2110,stay safe. We just had our first snow storm of the year here in Kentucky with 4 inches of the white stuff with about an inch of freezing rain. It shut everything down for the day.
160156,Headhunter,2008-02-13 15:40:00,5703,"Can't agree with you more Wayne! My normal commute home is about 45 minutes, door to door! Yesterday, I left the office at 4:30 and arrived home at 7:05! At one time, we actually managed to get up to 40k! If you are not confident driving in this stuff, STAY HOME! HH"
