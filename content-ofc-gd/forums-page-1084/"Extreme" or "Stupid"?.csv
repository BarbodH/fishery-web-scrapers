159365,Rich,2008-02-11 02:26:00,3927,"My opinion is leaning towards the latter when reflecting upon today's attempt at carp fishing. It was -27 out there with the windchill.. if that water was sitting still it would be ice! Harsh. Even if we did get hits, the extreme winds would have hindered our ability to detect them.  But like any fishing trip, the fun wasn't in the catching. It was still fun to get out, even if it was a short trip.      Now you can call us ""The Masked Carp Crusaders"""
159371,mepps,2008-02-11 02:58:00,1301,I'm gonna go with extremely stupid on this one
159373,LeXXington,2008-02-11 03:03:00,1928,Too cold for me
159377,wolfville,2008-02-11 03:18:00,396,At least you went out and had fun....
159378,waterwolf,2008-02-11 03:24:00,556,"no thanks, not without a decent fire close by .lol"
159379,tdotfisherman,2008-02-11 03:31:00,317,"I think thats awsome.. who cares how cold it is.. I went out fishing about a week ago and it was about -5, and I only fished for about 20 minutes before I threw in the towel due to the cold, but who cares!? It was just fun getting out there, and I'm sure you feel the same way.."
159380,irishfield,2008-02-11 03:34:00,26272,No slush... no hauling a sled of gear ... no drilling holes.. any Lake Trout in there Rich ? lol
159385,charlied,2008-02-11 04:05:00,584,"way to go Rich and his girl...I did that last year on simcoe with 60 click winds , and -25-30, couldn't get the ice hut up so I said I did not drive 2 hours to go back home..sat there back to the wind for 6 hours...I know exactly what you went thru...except one thing...you guys are way under dressed, at least I had my survival suit on....geez Rich!  LOL"
159417,ccmtcanada,2008-02-11 12:25:00,7971,"Rich...not crazy...maybe obsessed?? LOL.  Good on you for getting out there!  My first steelie ever came on a day exactly like this day you went out.   It was well worth it!  There is no fishable open water around me or else I'd have been out there as well I'm sure.  It's been well over a month since I last wet a line and bly and I are going stir crazy!!!  Great job...even with no fish, looks like a good time out there."
159430,holdfast,2008-02-11 13:22:00,1813,"Good on you.  You can always dress warm.  But if you get a chance to enjoy the outdoors, go for it.  but I got to admit, I lazied out yesterday, for my jog, but then again -40s with the wind chill."
159433,Pigeontroller,2008-02-11 13:56:00,2793,"Keep in mind with those air temps fish brought out of the water will likely not recover well, eyes freeze over for one..."
159489,Reef Runner,2008-02-11 15:27:00,981,"Extreme.  Is this a poll? J/K lol.  Good on ya for getting out.  Most, including myself, would've stayed home, but we suffer from fishing withdrawal.  You two are a brave pair.  reefrunner"
159493,myst,2008-02-11 15:31:00,57,Stupid.  I hate winter!
159511,ShaunB,2008-02-11 16:04:00,73,plain crazy!  That's one of those days your beer will freeze before you are done it....definatley need a shanty on a day like that!

159600,Mark Kulik,2008-02-11 19:48:00,348,Ive had my sanity questioned a lot in the past Rich-but you are a carp maniac!-good job-better than sitting around!
159604,addict,2008-02-11 19:54:00,475,hardcore i love it havent tried it for carp but ive fished for steel well below zero

159671,Crazyhook,2008-02-12 00:54:00,1154,you have one crazy woman Rich...
159741,Rizzo,2008-02-12 03:09:00,4754,"hmmmm, fishing for carp in -27 degrees...that question of stupid or extreme is pretty much a no brainer....meaning you'd have to have no brains to try such a feat"
159745,setomonkey,2008-02-12 03:12:00,872,Extremely stupid or stupidly extreme? jk  I'm impressed you went out anyway with that cold snap!  Mike
159771,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-12 12:54:00,2585,i think its awesome!  Good for you guys!  Cheers!
