160372,BENNY,2008-02-14 00:38:00,37,I know I have asked a few questions about this topic and thought I had it all down pat with the websites I have been on but recently I was told that I need the titles (ownerships) for the boat and trailer in my name prior to getting to the border? I thought this was true for a new boat but does this apply for a used boat. I thought the selelr jsut signed them over to me and I brought those with the bill of sale into Ont and then got it changed over to my name. To anyone that has bought a used boat in the US which is the correct way. I am heading down next week to pick it up so hoping to get this cleared up. I will call CBSA but just though I would ask someone who has actually been through it.  Sorry for all the bugging on this topic but I always get the best info here. Thanks again guys  Benny
