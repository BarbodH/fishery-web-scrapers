153836,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-24 13:38:00,1362,I was going to make my own Whitefish tip-up until I discovered this one at Wal-Mart....$7.97  ...it's made out of hardwood.... all I had to do was give it a quick painting and replace the crappy line that it came with!!  
153852,Fang,2008-01-24 15:32:00,1330,Wow at Walmart? I might buy a few just for the stands - nice and compact.  Get some line on it and tie on a spreader. Check the balance before going out. You want to keep the wire soemwhere around mid point. With the weight of the spreader you might have to move the wire forward quite a bit.  One trick is to back weight the end of the tip up with a washer or 2 and a bit of tape.  If you have any glow in the dark paint try it on the tips. Makes it even more visible in a dark hut.

153863,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-24 16:31:00,1362, I'm going to put the line on shortly and test it.....we're heading out tomorrow morning..thanks for the tips!! It's very compact....the stand comes apart as well so you can put it in your tote bag without worrying that it will break!!
153875,irishfield,2008-01-24 18:15:00,26272,Have a great trip Steve ! Say hello to Rick for me... and probably for Fang as well !    Remember..stay on the plowed paths with your truck...'till they tell you otherwise.
