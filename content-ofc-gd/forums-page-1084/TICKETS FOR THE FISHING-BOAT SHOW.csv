159099,Blake,2008-02-10 14:40:00,418,Fishing World has donated 4 pairs of VIP tickets for the upcoming FISHING/BOAT show this week at the International Centre for our members.  Since there are alot of us I was thinking the first 4 people to donate to Maureen for the Tyler Charity Tournament of $15 each 2 ticket set will get the tickets.  This is going for a great cause and is only $7.50 a ticket which is a savings itself. TICKETS NO LONGER AVAILABLE see my other post.

I was so looking forward to going to this then BPS the next day.  I have never been to either.  I'm sure it won't take long for them to be scooped."
160050,Blake,2008-02-13 03:00:00,418,"Well no one seems interested so I will take these tickets off and give them back to Fishing World.  Sorry Mo, I am surprised that no one wanted to help out the auction and also go to the show."
