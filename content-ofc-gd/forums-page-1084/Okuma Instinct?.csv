Am thinking about purchasing one and would like to compare it to some others I've been debating. Most importantly, does it have plastic gears.  Any info would be greatly appreciated!"
160108,Chrispy,2008-02-13 13:39:00,168,"Hey Rich, if it is anything like the VS series it will be a great reel...I love my Okuma!!!!!  I will see if I can dig up if it has plastic gears for you....   Chrispy!"

160305,Chrispy,2008-02-13 22:22:00,168,"if the drag system is anything like the VS series you will love that reel....I have a few Okuma's and the drag system on the cheaper reels are that of more expensive models of the other brands....SMOOTH!!!!  Good luck with that Buddy.....Hey I'm not sure if you are close to London or not but there is a fishing show on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th at the Western Fair Grounds.....I'll be working the Wally's Baits booth.....stop by and say HEY!!
