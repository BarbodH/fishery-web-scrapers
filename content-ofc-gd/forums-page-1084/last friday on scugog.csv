159866,Terry,2008-02-12 17:55:00,14456,very nice haul  I have never caught those bottle fish before  I guess you cook them in a beer batter.........LOL
159904,irishfield,2008-02-12 19:35:00,26272,"Caught a can... but never a bottle.  Some nice fish there fella, but remember CO's were given the power to lay LOOR charges last year."
159906,Fishnfiend,2008-02-12 19:43:00,357,LOOR charges ?
159908,irishfield,2008-02-12 19:45:00,26272,Liquor out of residence...
159909,Fishnfiend,2008-02-12 19:48:00,357,I thought that is what thermoses were for...
159915,tonyb,2008-02-12 20:14:00,1637,Has anyone been actually ticketed for that though?  I've had open beer in the ice hut on several occasions when being checked by a c.o. and never got a ticket...always worried about it though...  Tony
160034,tjsa,2008-02-13 02:10:00,1578," Was that since September of 2007(I think), when the CO's were able to enforce the Liquor Act, Tony? Lots of anglers up this way learned pretty quick about it. Since I never take any alcohol with me, cause I only day trip, maybe if you are in your hut, staying overnight, its not an infraction. But, I do not think you can be outside your hut, checking your other line, with a beer in hand, in open view. Don't quote me on that though, I am not really sure.  Best thing would be to call the MNR, and find out the details of what they can now enforce, and in what situations you may be in violation of the act."
160061,Ramble,2008-02-13 05:11:00,713,We had a guy stop and talk to us. He mentioned that the police have been checking Scugog and fining people for booze ont eh ice. They have a 0 tolerance policy right kniw. it's a $200 fine.  Anyway...that's what i heard.  -R-
160063,Weeds,2008-02-13 07:04:00,782,"About 3 or 4 years back a CO approached a friend and me while fishing and we were sitting amidst a pretty good amount of empties. He said CO's had the power to lay charges and this was awhile back, athough he just told us to make sure we cleaned up before we left. We did. Happy ending for all."
