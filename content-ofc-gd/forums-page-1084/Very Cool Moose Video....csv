159779,douG,2008-02-12 13:25:00,2693,"The music is Finnish.  That was one cute little baby moosey playing in the puddles, but I don't know about a bull moose as a housepet."
159789,tonyb,2008-02-12 14:10:00,1637,"That moose has got it made!  I agree with douG, still a wild animal and I don't think it's such a good idea to get your kid to ride on the back of a moose hehe"
159791,Roy,2008-02-12 14:12:00,13728,Never could figure out why folks play with their food.
159794,Greencoachdog,2008-02-12 14:13:00,8163,Can you imagine the size of the litter box you'd have to have for that thing???
159795,Garyv,2008-02-12 14:14:00,547,Wonder if it's housebroken?
159798,LeXXington,2008-02-12 14:18:00,1928,"With Kids, dog and cat.. don't think I have any more room on my bed for a moose"
159877,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-12 18:13:00,2585,"Not my idea of a 3some!  Kind of neat that they trained a moose.  Still though its a wild animal, not sure its the best idea!  Cheers!"
159905,Fishnfiend,2008-02-12 19:41:00,357,"I'd have a special crop of corn, beets, dogwood, oak and maple trees planted just for it.  That is until I drew a tag for the area!   Interesting, but probably not the most intelligent thing to do.  Have these people not seen what a whitetail does when it freaks out indoors?  Multiply that by about 6..."
159910,highdrifter,2008-02-12 19:53:00,2534,Seen that one a while back.  I want one!  I think this was shot in New Brunswick..  No surprises there... the moosies outnumber people like 2 to 1!!  cheers HD
159912,Daplumma,2008-02-12 20:10:00,1961,"Pretty cool video,thing is tamer than most domestic livestock.The music is by loituma,levas polka.One of my favorite songs. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjvVBCNcL_A Here is a live version. Joe ."
159993,Rizzo,2008-02-13 00:48:00,4754,dang weirdos...maybe we can get cliff and his band to play that polka
160023,Bob,2008-02-13 01:50:00,370,Folks in that part of the world domesticated reindeer (same as our caribou) and moose is just the largest of the deer family.  Wonder how Bruce Moose feels about Bullwinkle's antlers hanging on the wall?
