160014,Radnine,2008-02-13 01:38:00,1538,I am new to this group as well and somewhat intimidated by the grandeur of this site. But I have just purchased a new boat after much careful consideration and would be happy to share my findings. PM me if you are interested.
159483,myst,2008-02-11 15:21:00,57,"Wow, thanks for all of the great replies! There's so much useful information here. I'm not really 100% sure if I will be fishing mostly smaller lakes, we're not species specific although we would love to go after bigger fish! That would probably mean you have to fish in bigger lakes right?  I went out and bought the Boatguide magazine. I'm going to visit the dealership in Kemptville that was mentioned, anyone know any other good dealers in my area? I would have loved to visit the fishing and boat show but Toronto is too far of a drive especially in this weather.  As for buying new vs used, what can go wrong with a boat other than the motor, other than dings and scratches? Is it uncommon to buy a used boat and just buy a new motor for it?"
159488,myst,2008-02-11 15:25:00,57, That's why I asked you guys first! If I say that to a salesman most will just try to sell me the highest commission boat he can find.
159497,charlesn,2008-02-11 15:38:00,551,"I have not been in a fishing boat that is truly ""comfortable"" for 5 people bass fishing.  For trolling, still fishing or live bait fishing, sure, but for standing and constantly casting and retrieving and setting the hook, changing baits, etc.  I've been in bass and walleye boats up to 22'.  A pontoon boat is great for large numbers of people, but obviously is not the most portable of rigs or fastest or sexiest...  But having a BBQ on-board is nice.  I'd recommend getting a used 20-22' aluminum multi-species (deep-v or semi deep-v) boat with a 135-225 HP motor on the back.  Brand names are just that, not that important, all makes have good ones and EVERY SINGLE make has lemons and outright crap coming out of their factories.  The more deck space it has (I know Lund made an 18 footer that was all deck) the more likely you will find the space to be comfortable.  You can put fishing seat bases (with removable seats) wherever you want and make as much storage as possible to avoid tripping over stuff.  A tiller will afford more space overall inside the boat and but a console can be more comfortable.  For 175 HP and up, a console I think is a must.  I'd also highly recommend a foot throttle at those HPs.  Take my opinion with a grain of salt though as I have a 20' bass boat and don't like having to fish with more than 1 person at a time and in fact find that the front deck (about the size of a snooker table) is ""just right"" for one person - that person being me.  lol  Others probably have a better tolerance for somewhat crowded fishing.  Good luck on finding the right rig for you.  One warning, I started off exactly like you, eventually bought the wrong boat (although it gave me plenty of good times) and am on boat #6 and still always searching for the ""perfect"" rig.  It doesn't exist and every year they think of new ""must have"" features.  The Lund stern drive with a heater built-in would be my first choice for a ""2nd rig"" for fishing the Niagara in the winter.  An Allison or Bullet would be nice for just trying to rip your passenger's faces off with ludicrous speed.  A giant ""tuna boat"" would be nice for lumpy days on the great lakes, and sometimes a 1 man coleman crawdad with a troller is just right for seclusion and getting in to those hard to reach places.  But really any boat at all is better than being stuck on shore and will surely beat a rental...  Charles"
159520,PERCHER,2008-02-11 16:17:00,787,Here is a good deal on a great Brand of boat with real sweet price tag. http://www.portcolbornemarine.com/html/boa...ts&view=277
159531,doubleheader,2008-02-11 16:57:00,497,"Let me say right up front I'm not a dealer but I was recently helping a friend of mine in his selection of a new rig.  In fact he just finalized his deal last week. He settled on an Alumacraft and I have to say it is quite a rig.  Anyhow, during the process I called the Crestliner dealer I bought my boat from (a U.S. dealer in NYS) and he quoted me a 2008 1850 Fish Hawk with walk tru windshield, 150 HP Opti, and heavy duty trailer with brakes for just over $25K.  I thought that was a pretty darn good price. I've had good luck with my 1850 Fish Hawk, but it's not a Lund for sure. Then again a Lund is more money for sure."
159591,davew3,2008-02-11 19:32:00,430,"Check out this show.  There should be a bunch there to look at and to touch. http://www.sportshows.ca/Ottawa/index.html.  If you fish the Ottawa you know the river can get nasty at times,   so can the St. Lawrence. But if you fish the smaller ?  so measure your garage and get the biggest that will fit.  Trailer and boat.  Look for a swing away trailer. More questions,   do you want a kicker motor and a bow mount trolling motor ?  Fish finders, full roof, heaters. Insurance,  boaters licence ? Good luck."
159603,danbo,2008-02-11 19:54:00,2646,"18' Deep-V Aluminum Hull with properly rated motor & prop. is a great start. Millions of extras like cover,Bimini top, sonar,gps, legal flares,vests,ropes Stabilizer -fin for better hole-shot, trolling plate,lights.. Take your time & do your homework. New is good, especially with extended warranties in writing.  http://www.boatsville.com/boatbuyingtips.cfm"
