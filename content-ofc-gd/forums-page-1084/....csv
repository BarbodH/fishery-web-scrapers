159689,Mike the Pike,2008-02-12 01:32:00,3421,Dats a real nice report there Bubba nice looking healthy fish and much better than I have been doing lately.  Are those Crappies really that big or are you still short  BTW you should invest in one of those fishing towels instead of always wipin your hands on the right side of your pants.  Another report but always the same wet spot  What good is a side console without a windsheild wiper.  Good Fishin Bubba nice crappies
