159868,Bernie,2008-02-12 17:59:00,3190,Talking to a fellow and relayed this to me. A couple of guys were out on Wasi Lake fishing with too many lines. They seen a CO coming and cut the extra lines off. Noting the holes with no ice in them asked about the possibility of using too many lines. They told the usual lies. The CO pulls out a magnet on a line and drops it down the hole. Pulls up 2 lines with live minnows. Explain that he says. Hmmmm. They were charged.  No sympathy here.
