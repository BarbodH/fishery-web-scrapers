159969,Clampet,2008-02-12 23:24:00,1947,Haven't heard from Mahumba for some time.
159971,Roy,2008-02-12 23:26:00,13728,"I don't think there's a soul in this world who can dislike that dude. Raheem McHindu, you're my hero too."
159972,bigfish1965,2008-02-12 23:27:00,3382,Roger looks cute in them braids.
159983,Mahumba,2008-02-13 00:02:00,28,"Hey Guys!  Raheem McHindu! The Bald Bass.....d!  Yup I got it shaved yesterday. I just hope the kid who gets my hair doesn't mind getting gray hair in it!  This is the 2nd time I have done this and it's great. The only difference is I did it in the winter this time and I don't know how you bald guys make it in the winter. Hell I just learned you just can pull a toque off with stubble on your head. Dam velcro!  Clampet, I'm here every day. May not post as much but I'm here.  Rick Rick Rick........ Actually..... I think I'm frightened.... Someone hold me......  Thanks again!  Roger"

159992,TJQ,2008-02-13 00:46:00,7806,Friggin Hippie anyway...good on ya bud.
159997,Rattletrap2,2008-02-13 01:09:00,1652,"Roger, I got a little concerned when I opened Dan's link on my Slowwwwww internet connection.....and see a picture of you coming in slowly.......and the top story about some guy getting sexually asaulted while in police custody....and naturally just put two and two together.....and am glad to see that this ""Top story"" was not about you! LOL Just kidding!  Hats off to you for doing a great thing!   I have a couple of Thunder Bay guys down here for Trade school this month and was talking about yourself and Dan C to them. I wondered where you had gotten to, but glad to see you are doing fine!"
160001,danc,2008-02-13 01:18:00,4677,LOL Rattletrap2... There always seems to be something strange about a Mahumba story. But not quite that strange though. I checked the link and saw exactly what you were talking about. Thanks for the laugh...
160013,motv8tr,2008-02-13 01:34:00,2587,"Way to go Roger, I sure hope you have good quality hats   but as you know it's only hair and it will grow back.  Maureen"
160045,Joey,2008-02-13 02:46:00,9122,"Mine was slow to load also and I saw the story on the right hand side.  I was concerned for a moment  You're awesome Roger.  You should make your presense known around here more often, we miss your humour, wisdom, and backflips off decks  Joey"
160058,tjsa,2008-02-13 04:20:00,1578,Why do I have a vision of Pipi Longstockings in my head............................................or should that be............Pepe Longstockings?
160066,Spiel,2008-02-13 09:37:00,9065,....Well ain't he special    and I mean that in the kindest of ways Roger.
160068,Big Cliff,2008-02-13 10:05:00,6899,No wonder I'm proud to be an OFNr when we have people like this doing so much to help others.  Good on ya Roger!
