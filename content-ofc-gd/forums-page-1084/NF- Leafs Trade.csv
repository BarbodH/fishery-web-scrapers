159590,SlowPoke,2008-02-11 19:30:00,2984,"All this talk about Sundin, Tucker, McCabe and Kaberle and thier no-trade deals... Shouldn't Toskala be trade bait at the deadline?  -He's been probably a top 10 goalie for the last 2 months -He has a contract, not a rent-a-player -He has given his team a chance to win every night since early December.  Nobody mentions him moving yet he's been the hottest Leaf in the last 2 months. If they're going to blow this team up they might as well cut him loose and insure a last place finish and a shot at 1st overall pick."
159593,JohnF,2008-02-11 19:35:00,3494,The talking heads on one of the shows talked about that the other night. Apparently the Leafs have a young guy in the system who looks promising. I wish I could remember the conversation but it seems to me they worked up a good sounding scenario for trading him.  JF
159595,John,2008-02-11 19:40:00,2956,"Hey Brian,  I really think that anyone one that team that is movable (ie., doesn't have a no trade clause) will be available. Are you thinking of Pogge as a starter? Raycroft has had enough opportunities..  I could be wrong but I don't think that last place finish guarantees first overall pick...."
159597,ShaunB,2008-02-11 19:40:00,73,The goalie you are thinking of is Justin Pogie I think.  Yeha he is pretty good.  Ottawa and Carolina made a 4 player trade today!
159611,ccmtcanada,2008-02-11 20:19:00,7971,"Sure...Toskala is game, but why would we?  I'd say they try to unload the big salaries.  The Leafs have been  trying to get a good starting goalie for 3 years now they finally have one that isn't breaking the bank."
159612,Headhunter,2008-02-11 20:30:00,5703,"No need for all this trade talk... the Leafs are gonna make the playoffs! I believe that the meds, have kicked in! I'd be a lot upset at their season so far, if I wasn't so heavily medicated! HH"
159618,SlowPoke,2008-02-11 20:51:00,2984,"I wouldn't trade Tlusty, Strolman, Kaberle, Steen I wouldn't start Pogge, start/rotate Clemenson/Raycroft and keep Pogge with the Marlies for another year. I stated trading Toskala would insure last overal and a shot at 1st overall. Deep draft this year from what those that know the game say... any pick 1-5 is solid, perhaps even a franchise player in 1-3.   I don't have any trouble keeping Toskala but I can't see making any headway at the trade deadline with anyone else. If Toronto is in rebuilding mode, they might as well tank in goal until they build a good enough team for Pogge in the '09-'10 season."
159624,urbanangler1990,2008-02-11 21:34:00,933,"how bout trade sundin to a winning team that have a good chance of winning the cup and get him back next year, this way he will be happier and we get some different players, it would be like a 4 month contract..."
159625,John,2008-02-11 21:35:00,2956, Sound words Brian but do they have the cojones?
159644,JohnF,2008-02-11 22:30:00,3494, Are they goalies?  JF
159722,holdfast,2008-02-12 02:25:00,1813,"Ill trade Latendresse, La Pierre, Pletanic, Brisbois ( AKA Brokenwood), Both Kosteatsyns, Koivu, Hamerlik, Streit, Dandenault for Tucker.  Out with the Wimps, in with some Toughness.  Habs couldnt beat themselves out of a wet paperbag.  Oh dont get your Panties in an uproar because they are in second place, the word is out that they hide when checked or threatened."
159734,Rizzo,2008-02-12 03:02:00,4754,"its hard to trade Toskala and come out on top because we just gave up a first round pick for the guy, and probably a pretty darn high one at that!  Would someone else give you a first round pick for him? Maybe, but even if they did, it wouldn't be as high a pick as the one the Leafs gave up to get him."
159750,John,2008-02-12 03:35:00,2956," Si, Si.......Spanish for goalies JF.."
160217,Tacklebuster,2008-02-13 18:19:00,303,The first thing they should trade are the owners.
160368,walleyejigger,2008-02-14 00:34:00,876,"   good job on trying to turn another leafs thread into another habs bashing thread, new one"
160386,holdfast,2008-02-14 01:14:00,1813,Im just helping the leafs fans by saying that Ill trade two thirds of the Habs for one Tucker.  I want him back on the Habs.
160428,carll2,2008-02-14 02:44:00,443,tucker never did anything good for the habs why would we want him back now?  dont send him here please
