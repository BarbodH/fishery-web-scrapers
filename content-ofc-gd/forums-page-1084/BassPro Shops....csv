While I was there I noticed that they had Frabil Ice Rod Combos on clearance for 14.99 (Reg 24.99) it also includes the tip spring and a small pack of jigs... Not a bad little combo    They also had all of their Baddboys on clearance as well, there were a ton of other clearance deals on their ice fishing products... so if your looking for a deal now's the time to stock up for next year!
