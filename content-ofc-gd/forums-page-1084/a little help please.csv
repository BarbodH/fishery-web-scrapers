160224,bigdaddydb,2008-02-13 18:45:00,8,"I'm coming up from cleveland to the mattawa area tonight.  Any ideas for ice fishing spots up there?  How about a general ice report?  Any lakes in the area with public access where I might have a chance at some walleye or perch?  At least a weather report!  I have a clam shanty so I don't need to rent a hut or anything like that but since we haven't had too much ice down here, I'm dying to get on some fish."

If you turn your radio dial to 680am you will get weather and traffic reports.  You might want to take a look at this link for weather forcasts Here  Sorry I can't be of more help....  Maureen"
