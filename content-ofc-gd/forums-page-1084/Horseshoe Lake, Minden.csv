159907,bbog,2008-02-12 19:43:00,665,Disregard post - was thinking of Horseshoe Lake off HWY69 S. of Parry Sound. My bad.
159963,Jigger,2008-02-12 23:10:00,1237,"I don't fish it much. But I know there are some good sized Largemouth and Smallmouth in there. There should also be some Lakers and Whitefish. I've only ever shore fished there, but the results were good."
160037,Pigeontroller,2008-02-13 02:15:00,2793,The Bay behind the causeway on the East side is shallow but I have caught a few nice Largemouth from it. You can also try the river below Horseshoe Lake for Smallies.
160075,singingdog,2008-02-13 11:21:00,1047,"Wall-to-wall cottages on that lake. Having said that, it is still a pretty good multi-species lake: lakers, whitefish, LM, SM. If you have a boat, you also have access to Mountain lake. Between the two, there is pretty much every type of fishing: 100' deep sections, rocky points/islands, weed flats, current."
