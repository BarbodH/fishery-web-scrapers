160407,Ramble,2008-02-14 02:12:00,713,Can someone explain to me why anyone cares about this?
160412,Landlocked,2008-02-14 02:19:00,171,"because it's off season and this is the ""Winternet"""
160498,fishless,2008-02-14 12:19:00,82,i'm thinking clemens is the better liar.mcnamee seems to have solid info that is confirmed by people.thats my 2 cents on this day chheers jamie
160516,doubleheader,2008-02-14 13:01:00,497,"I love baseball, I always have, and always will. Thus one reason I chose the handle Doubleheader. Seems to me MLB may be imploding. Here's a not so illogical potential outcome of all this Bull: Suppose it can be substantiated an owner or team executive knew what was going on, and that person's team won a World Series.  Is it possible we will see a string of lawsuits by the other clubs claiming damages for being cheated out of revenue? I'm not suggesting this would be good, in fact I despise our litigation happy culture, but I do think this outcome is very possible. Many MLB owners are maverick eccentric types that love to put a burr under a competitor team's saddle and do so every chance they get."
160187,OhioFisherman,2008-02-13 17:22:00,6623,"Anyone watching this? A meeting of the tell a tale club, if front of expert tale tellers?"
160190,mistyriver1,2008-02-13 17:35:00,600,Listening on the radio Paul.  They're really drilling them eh !!!  Somebody's lyin
160193,darsky,2008-02-13 17:42:00,586,this is absolutely riveting. Mcnamee has been proven a liar. But the abcess on Clemens butt caused by a b12 shot.......? or Roger NOT knowing about his wife being injected with HGH?  Don't think so.Some lying on BOTH sides
160196,Kirk,2008-02-13 17:46:00,347,"clems is just digging himself deeper and deeper, Pettite admitted it and moved on and they are leaving him alone.  He should just admit it, join himself with some other big name company, spend his free time counting all his money and move on."
160198,OhioFisherman,2008-02-13 17:49:00,6623,"Kirk seems like everyone is lying but Roger, fancy that? He should have been a Dodger?  Really no clue, but there is something fishy!"
160201,John,2008-02-13 17:51:00,2956, A little late now (maybe) someone is gonna go to jail...........
160204,Kirk,2008-02-13 17:57:00,347,"Perjury...just keep denying LOL  I'm sure theres a club fed for clems, they found nice digs for Martha Stewart, a good ole boy like clems should find some nice accomodations IF they really start jailing American Pastimes heroes..."
160219,gekhunter,2008-02-13 18:28:00,61,"If Clems was a bit smarter he might have a chance...  too bad though, what a player and a great career will be ruined.  There are many others that did the same but didnt get caught"
160220,holdfast,2008-02-13 18:37:00,1813,"Clem should of just said, Yea I think so.  As far as I know athletes have used it for years to Heal muscles and ligaments quicker."
160222,gekhunter,2008-02-13 18:39:00,61,"I agree HF, admit and beg for forgiveness.  People respect that more than a cowardly liar"
160223,danbo,2008-02-13 18:43:00,2646,I think Mr. Clemons will be cleared & the rat will have a hard time in the slam!
160231,OhioFisherman,2008-02-13 19:07:00,6623,"You have to understand that baseball is a legal monopoly here. Congress and I believe the courts have granted them that status. Both parties would look pretty foolish if a star was to go to jail, JMHO a lot of yak and free TV and radio time for the elected officials."
160236,Hotrod2066,2008-02-13 19:19:00,40,"I'm listening to it, it's great. All they have is one guys word against another. I don't see how anyone could go to jail based on that, there's no physical evidence."
160238,doubleheader,2008-02-13 19:31:00,497,Do I think Clemens injected? probably yes Do I think MLB was aware all along- yes Do I think our elected officials are grandstanding- absolutely yes
160245,irishfield,2008-02-13 19:54:00,26272,"Do you think a country, that for all intensive purposes is bankrupt, should be wasting tax payers resources to dig? - NO  Do you think they should move on and let the league worry about what's happening now, not then - YES"
160246,gekhunter,2008-02-13 19:55:00,61, Exactly.  Don't they have anything better to do?
160255,OhioFisherman,2008-02-13 20:10:00,6623,"Questions that come to mind  Needles and gauze turned over  results of DNA tests?  possible to date blood samples?  possible to test for steroids from the gauze or needles and date such? if planted after the fact?  Don, Phil step up! I know you, wanna give me a shot? I know you are not doctors!  My B-12 is low also!"
160261,charlied,2008-02-13 20:19:00,584,Its a shame...hundreds of thousands of athletes around the world do it but they only seem to wanna make an example of the Best of the Best!  I hope he is cleared!!
160279,bucktail,2008-02-13 21:09:00,1857,He has to be lying. He is tight with Pettite and he admitted the both of them did it. What would Pettite have to gain......nothing.
160283,TOM C,2008-02-13 21:21:00,76,No doubt Roger is lieing. now the big Question should he be banned from playing and not allowed in the Hall of Fame knowing he broke the rules and cheated.
160301,OhioFisherman,2008-02-13 22:08:00,6623,"LOL Wayne, intents and purposes, we butcher the Kings English enough. That`s 2 of us now that realize we are digging a hole here and there are better ways to spend tax dollars. I don`t think you can be my VP(virtual Pilot), probably have to be born here."
160302,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-13 22:12:00,957,"Major league baseball began drug testing in 2002.  Has Roger tested positive?  He seems to be accused by hearsay evidence that he used a legal drug, without a prescription, well over five years ago.  The statute of limitations on such a charge, I believe, is five years.  So, is this another case about nothing with intent to trip up a defendant on purjury?  The former cop who became a trainer also received a phony PhD from a mail order company that didn't have a campus.  Is it usual and customary for a trainer to keep used needles and gauze for over five years?  He was saving DNA.  IMO only if he's dirty and is setting up others to share the blame in case he's caught and wants to cut a deal.  While DNA on gauze was in Phony Doctor's control he could add anything to fit his needs and add to his story during a five year period.  ""Trainer"" called himself Doctor and signed his checks as a doctor.  Punish Clemens if he tested positive.  To me it's a bunch of lesser people performing an investigation of a greater person   It should have been handled by baseball, not congress.   They feel the need to burn someone because they wasted time and money on an investigation about nothing."
160309,TOM C,2008-02-13 22:28:00,76,"he,s a cheat but im sure he will get away with it,"
160310,Cory,2008-02-13 22:35:00,170,"I tend to agree with Wayne.  Why waste the money.  It’s only baseball, who cares.  People are losing their homes, jobs, lives….  Much more important things in life than a baseball player.  Now if they tried to accuse Dave Mercer of using banned baits…….."
160391,holdfast,2008-02-14 01:26:00,1813,Hey now he can have his own movie like Pete Rose.  One of Baseballs Greatest.  Hopefully Rodger doesn't get shamed and hung out to dry by his own just like what we did to the worlds fastest man.
