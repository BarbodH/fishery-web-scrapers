Anyway, made a quick coffee and headed out to the ice shack for an early start......I could see the clouds moving out and a nice front with clear skies moving in...THE BITE WAS ON!!!  ..after a few hours of steady bites and a few keepers, I started gettin a tad hungry and decided to come in at 10:00AM for some breakfast....  Here's a few pics to share with you all.....      Hopefully the afternoon bite will be just as good!!!!!"

159135,Clampet,2008-02-10 16:04:00,1947,You won't have any fogged up winders with that stove.  The axe is the type I used to use when I used to venture out on 1st Ice.  Really like yer accomodations.
