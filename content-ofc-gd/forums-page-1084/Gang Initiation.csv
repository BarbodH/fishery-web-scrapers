159880,dsn,2008-02-12 18:29:00,1018,"Check this out......   This is important.......Hiba works for the police & you can call the phone number and double check this info. BE CAREFUL  Someone was following me on my way to Whitby Friday night with no headlights on. I just assumed they forgot. As I was ahead of them I had no way to signal them. They flashed their lights at me a couple of  times and eventually passed me. The car was packed with teenagers. If this was a gang initiation, I am glad I did not signal them as I had the kids in the car.  Please be careful everybody.     RCMP WARNING Please pass is on! Important police warning.. Very scary, now moving east....started in Manitoba , now in Saskatchewan , and moving east and west.  This came directly from our Driver Training People who  got the warning. Pass this to anyone you can. One of the officers who works with the DARE program has passed along the following warning and asked that it be shared with all drivers. This is an extremely serious matter.  If you are driving after dark and you see a car without its head-lights on, do not flash your lights, do not blow your horn or make any signals to the driver of the other car. There is a new common gang initiation 'game' going on the streets. The new  member being initiated drives along without his headlights on until someone notices and flashes their headlights or makes some sort of other action to signal him. The gang member is now required to chase the car and shoot at or into the car in order to  complete his initiation requirements.  Make sure you share this information with your family, friends, and anyone else you can reach. If you have any questions or information, please call your local police department. Please take this seriously. This  is not a joke. Please pass this on to everyone you know on e-mail and in person. It could save someone's life.

159885,Headhunter,2008-02-12 18:42:00,5703,"NOt to be-little the importance of this message, but when was the last time you saw a car that did not have running lights on, all the time? I received this message yesterday and am wondering if this is fact real? If it is, then it's yet another example of our society slowly falling to it's knees! HH"
159888,Joey,2008-02-12 18:49:00,9122,"Its false, and has been around for over 10 years.  I don't remember the last time I read in the paper about a person getting shot while driving after he flashed somebody, do you???  Joey"

159900,OhioFisherman,2008-02-12 19:18:00,6623,"dsn don`t feel stupid, a lot of stuff going around, better to error on the safe side until it gets checked out! Thanks for the thought and Joe thanks for the info!  Sounds like a normal day in Cleveland, just being in the wrong neighborhood can get you problems."
159918,lunkerbasshunter,2008-02-12 20:20:00,2585,yep this one has been around for years.  Cheers!
160015,John Bacon,2008-02-13 01:40:00,3277,  Another clue is the police resorting to a chain email as opposed to a press release to inform people.  That's a common giveaway to an urban myth.
