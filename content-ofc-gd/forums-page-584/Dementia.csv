543712,misfish,2011-01-26 12:11:00,29133,"It was way to early in the AM for me, to get this right.LOL   Dementia  Quiz  Below are four ( 4 ) questions and a Bonus question  to test your perception, reasoning and the quickness of your logical processing. They are stated simply so you should try to answer them instantly. To assure the accuracy of the results, you  should not take your time , but instead, answer each of them immediately .  OK?    Let's find out just how clever you really are....    Ready? GO!!! (scroll down slowly to uncover Q's and A's )         First Question :  You are a participant in a race. You overtake the second person. What position are you in?      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<       Answer : If you answered that you are first, then you are absolutely WRONG! If you overtake the second person and you take his place, YOU are in second place!  Try not to mess up next time. Now answer the second question, but don't take as much time as you t ook for the first question, OK?       Second Question : If you overtake the last person, then you are...? (scroll down)    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~            Answer : If you answered that you are second to last, then you are  ; ; ; ;WRONG again.. Tell me Sunshine, how can you overtake the LAST person??   You're not very good at this, are you?     Third Question : Very tricky arithmetic! Note: This must be done in your head only. Do NOT use paper and pencil or a calculator . Try it.    Take 1000 and add 40 to it. Now add another 1000 Now add 30 . Add another 1000 . Now add 20 . Now add another 1000 . Now add 10 .. What is the total?   Scroll down for the correct answer.....  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~         Did you get 5000 ?  The correct answer is actually 4100 ..    If you don't believe it, check it with a calculator! Today is definitely not your day, is it ?  Maybe you'll get the last question right... Maybe...    Fourth Question :  Mary's father has five daughters: 1... Nana, 2. Nene, 3. Nini,  4. Nono, and ???  What is the name of the fifth daughter?        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        Did you Answer Nunu? NO! Of course it isn't. Her name is Mary! Read the question again!    Okay, now the Bonus round,  i.e., a final chance to redeem yourself: 0A     A mute person goes into a shop and wants to buy a toothbrush. By imitating the action of brushing his teeth he successfully expresses himself to the shopkeeper and the purchase is done. Next, a blind man comes into the shop who wants to buy a pair of sunglasses; how does HE indicate what he wants?  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      It's really very simple   He opens his mouth and ask for it... Does your employer actually pay you to think?? If so Do NOT let them see your answers for this test!"

543820,Tybo,2011-01-26 17:33:00,1373,"For the second question to even exist,You would have to be in first and put the last place a lap down. So they are wrong with there question."
543825,misfish,2011-01-26 17:40:00,29133,"You got nascar brain. Now if Dale was in second,and took the lead,then he would be in first.See,simple."
