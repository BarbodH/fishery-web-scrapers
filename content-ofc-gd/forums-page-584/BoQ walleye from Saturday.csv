543509,ehg,2011-01-25 19:40:00,2666,Real beauty of a walleye  Quinte rocks for ice fishing. Hang on as the sunsets there is a good chance of a big walleye.  Tipping a jigging rap w/ minnow head works well.
543535,kickingfrog,2011-01-25 21:15:00,8333, The scuttlebutt back at the cars that day was that most of the groups did well in the am but not in the pm. I got mine at about 4:20pm and the 2 others at about 4:40pm.
543561,oldphart,2011-01-25 23:14:00,665,"~~~Great post bud thanks for sharing I'll be down there this weekend with posse, hope we do as well as you, or at least I hope I do as well"
543667,kickingfrog,2011-01-26 03:10:00,8333,"Finally looked at the gps today. The second spot was a 4km round trip. In the dark, after a long day, it felt like a lot more than 2 klics."
543694,limeyangler,2011-01-26 05:07:00,5204,Nice fisheeees KK.  Worth every minute of that long day no doubt.  Love the action you described on the Rap...jig...pause.....JIG....BAM! cool.
542712,kickingfrog,2011-01-23 15:17:00,8333,"Up a 3am. On the road with my brother by 4am. Meet our buddy at 7am. Holes drilled and lines in the water by 7:30am.  Nice fresh morning:   Moved around the first spot, only marked a few fish, and my brother was the only one to hook-up before lunch:   Headed in to a small town dinner in Desironto ($45 that the town of Innisfil will never see, plus 2 tanks of gas and gatoraid $140) and stoked the furnace for the afternoon.  Lunch for 3 guys, and I'm the smallest one by at least 80lbs: onion rings, burger and fries, poutine, toasted western omelette with extra toast and sausage, 2 bowls of potato soup and fish and chips.  Head out to our buddies second spot, and we're fishing by 2pm.  Set up a special tip-up at afternoon location.   Although set lines produced no fish for us.  Mark a lot more fish but can't get them to commit until I switch to a jigging rap after 4pm. First fish that shows after switching I stop jiggin', pause and then give it a quiver and BAM. Nice solid fish.      20 minutes later I got 2 more walleye around 2lbs and that was it except for some perch.  Long drive back to Barrie in a snow storm. in bed by midnight."
542714,Terry,2011-01-23 15:22:00,14456,you have got to love a 21 hour day all in the name of fishing  nice to see you got some walleye

542737,Fish Farmer,2011-01-23 16:03:00,2234,"Thanks for sharing, I gots to get down there for a 2 day'er. Man after my own heart, putting in a good day of fishin. Some guys just fish for a couple hours and go home to watch Judge Judy or the Maple Leafs play Perseverance, pays off"

542753,Rod Caster,2011-01-23 16:50:00,5784,"Big day, big fish, big lunch....who needs sleep?  "
542905,kickingfrog,2011-01-23 23:08:00,8333," The ""big"" one went right back down the hole that's way I didn't get a messure or a weight, although I should have at least eye balled it against the rod which is 32 inches.  The 2 smaller fish and a couple of perch were eaten today for lunch. My wife and our 2 year old son may like fresh fish even more than me.    They'll get some more use soon.    Me, that's who."
542908,Leecher,2011-01-23 23:14:00,7832," Awesome Dude Rob, just an observation, next time make sure you have the spool pointing down ward.... meaning the top should be flipped   Just like in the next pic  "
