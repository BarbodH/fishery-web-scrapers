Question:  1) Can anyone confirm the species caught there? (primarily Pike & Bass?)  2) Anyone caught another species not mentioned on that WFN blog?  PS: I can't provide the link, its blocked here @ work! LOL!  Thanks Folks, Appreciate anyone who can provide some input, A2F (RoB)"

543845,bassassin,2011-01-26 18:23:00,152,ive caught largies on top water pop r's and lost a big pike 8-10lbs when it bit through my line with a pop r! the strike scared the crap out of me since i didnt know their was any esox lucius in that lake! its a very small lake with an island... i would also look at ken Whillan's lots of pike and bass there is a 20ft hole in the relatively shallow lake that hold the majority of the fish in winter. the hole is in the southern basin pretty much on center!
