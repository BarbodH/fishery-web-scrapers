Latest i herd was that only 21 cars derail, and side swipped some cars on a train parked adjadcent to the derailed train.  Still though.  that's only a few minutes south of my cottage.  Hope knowone was injured.  http://news.sympatico.ctv.ca/home/emergency_crews_on_scene_of_major_train_derailment/84abc6f4   http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2011/01/26/severn-derailment-cp636.html"

The news did not leak to the media because they wanted to secure the location and protect against looting, amongst other things.  Crews were coming to the marina and water taxied to the site.  It was easier for them to bury the cargo in the bush.  Yup, all destroyed and under a mound now.  Apparently people still had the opportunity to loot the cargo from every direction before it was covered.  Where they came from is beyond me.  Strange how the wind can carry the news."
