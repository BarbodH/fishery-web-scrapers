543945,FishOn,2011-01-26 21:33:00,136,Taking pictures and posting them for everyone to see..... are not so safe after all!!!  Check out this site!!!  http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/video?id=7621105
543949,skeeter,2011-01-26 21:53:00,1907,Holy Crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thats all i can say for now.
543950,mercman,2011-01-26 21:53:00,7054, sheesh !!!Now what are we sposed to do???
543957,skeeter,2011-01-26 22:00:00,1907,LOL---i guess the days of swirling out the back ground on the fishing pictures is coming to an end!!!!!!!!!! 
543959,Terry,2011-01-26 22:04:00,14456,"you only have to worry about it if you are taking a picture with a gps enabled devise..like a cellphone  strangely enough, I just use a camera to take pictures so the only info I give out is the date of photo what camera and exposure vI used"
543961,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-26 22:12:00,2050," Terry the new ""cool"" thing that all the manufacturers are starting to do now is GPS enabled cameras.  Your run of the mill point and shoot will have this moving forward so people can organize their pictures via ""location"" and certain programs and websites will allow your friends to see where you took your prized photo! It's pretty simple to pull this information prior to posting the images though...."
543962,toca,2011-01-26 22:15:00,274,YES. ALL YOUR HONEYHOLES BELONG TO US.......    LOL   really now thats scary though.
543967,Terry,2011-01-26 22:23:00,14456, I ain't see one .....but as long as there is an off switch  or as long as I can go into properties and remove info  life is good ............
544018,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-27 00:43:00,2050,Yeah there's several ways you can go about revoking the coordinates.... Here's a link to one of Fuji's GPS enabled cameras.  http://www.fujifilm.com/news/n110105_07.html
544026,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-27 01:02:00,0,15 steelheaders and 23 muskie guys just smashed their iphones.
544043,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-27 01:38:00,2050, Hahaha That's funny stuff!
544059,GBW,2011-01-27 01:59:00,8460,LmAo!  But I think it's more like 38 steelheaders just did it.
544065,fishing n autograph,2011-01-27 02:11:00,2540,you can turn off the geotagging option of blackberrys...canon cameras don't geotag either
544112,jayess,2011-01-27 03:51:00,187,"another instance of what i despise about news reporting.  this feature of cameras has been around for a while. this isn't a privacy concern -- it's a feature. if someone uses a device and is unaware of what they're doing, that is their fault, and not one of the device or device manufacturer.  it's this same thinking that causes people to fear using email. It is not knowing what you're opening in an email attachment that gets you the virus, not the email itself.  On the one hand, I do hope that camera manufacturers disable geo-tagging by default. Wishful thinking, but it would at least be courteous -- in the same way that one should have to opt in for mailings from e-businesses, and not be signed up simply by installing a piece of software.  /rant"
544140,jjcanoe,2011-01-27 04:56:00,744, Glad I only have a brand new (1 month old and now out of date) XP15!  jjcanoe
544148,young_one,2011-01-27 05:12:00,620,"Turn off 3G and data for your iPhones, while out fishing"
544163,craigdritchie,2011-01-27 12:27:00,1586,"It's less of an issue for fishing pictures, since in most situations, just knowing the spot isn't enough. You have to be there at the right time, and that's entirely weather-dependent.  Different issue if its your kid or your wife being stalked by some creep. Perhaps thats one feature that manufacturers would we wise to do away with entirely."
544181,scugpg,2011-01-27 13:18:00,1373,I think you can turn off on most Android phones as well. It is sometime called Location or Location Awareness etc. It can be under Location or Security/Privacy settings. See attached.  I would think this is possible on Iphones as well.
544213,bigbuck,2011-01-27 14:41:00,2449,Big Brother is Watching YOU!!!!
544217,irishfield,2011-01-27 14:49:00,26272,Exactly buck... tracking your every move with transmitters in your cell phones... credit cards.. enhansed drivers licence and starting shortly (if not already) in your Canadian Passport. Can be picked up on a sensor from 50 feet way.
544240,splashhopper,2011-01-27 16:04:00,2931, I Have a berry and can't find the section to turn it off...  please advise if you know how.  Thanks
544244,fishing n autograph,2011-01-27 16:12:00,2540,"Irish, we don't have chipped passports yet. The US has started issuing them. That's why the electronic pick pocketing is more of a problem there than here. I'm sure we'll follpw suit though lol"
544356,johnnyb,2011-01-27 19:59:00,3413," Turn the camera on....hit your menu button, and select options.  Scroll down and you should see geotagging....default setting on mine was to ""disabled"""
544368,Rich,2011-01-27 20:30:00,3927,Does anyone post fishing pics anymore?
544382,Twocoda,2011-01-27 21:05:00,4130, thanks Johnny...just checked mine and its turned off too...
