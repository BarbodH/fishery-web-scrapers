543688,2advanced,2011-01-26 04:43:00,53,This might be dumb question but what atvs can be licensed in ontario? Are there certain regulations?  Like could I just buy a no named atv and plate it and insure it?
543703,Fishnwire,2011-01-26 06:54:00,983,"Good question.  I'm not really sure what the answer is.  However it stands to reason that you would need some kind of VIN number to register the machine.  Also, your insurance company is going to want a VIN as well as a better description of the bike than ""no named quad""...to give you a policy they're going to need to know the year, make, model and size.  Maybe I'm wrong."
543714,Fisherman,2011-01-26 12:23:00,7201,"Any ATV that meets MTO and SAE spec's can be licenced provided it has a VIN that are needed for both MTO registration and insurance.  This almost sounds a bit ""shady"", got a hot machine?"
543732,2advanced,2011-01-26 13:24:00,53,"Hahaha no I am in the market of getting a used snow mobile or atv but for my use I don't need anything fancy as I just want to get from point a to b without killing myself walking with a sled  I was lookin at these cheaper alternatives other than name band like yamaha, etc..  http://www.daymak.com/bikes-toronto/pages/atv/grunt110cert.html  Has anyone used these china machines? Lol."

He told me they get license at the local offices ""no problem"" but a few of his customers got rejected in TO and then tried in Barrie on his suggestion and succeeded. So it sounds to be not a sure thing to me.  Hoppy   "

543770,2advanced,2011-01-26 15:10:00,53,is it that bad? is it going to leave me stranded in the middle of simcoe? LOL
543773,porkpie,2011-01-26 15:16:00,2521,"Some things your ok buying cheap knock offs, as long as you realize they may fail.  Transportation is not something you want to have to worry about.  Further to that, where do you get parts/service when the cheap china bike falls apart.  And its probably not worth investing much money into either.  You can pick up an early to mid ninetys honda 300 fourtrax on kijiji for about $1800- 2400 give or take, in not bad condition if you are patient.  They are nearly bulletproof, we have 4 at my huntcamp.  1 from the late 80's that we drag out most deer with.  Parts are readily available, and if your not into fixing it yourself, there are a ton of reputable dealers.  For pure utility, thats the way to go, and not super expensive, but definately reliable!"
