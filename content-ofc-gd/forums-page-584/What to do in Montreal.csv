543155,HTHM,2011-01-24 20:52:00,4082,re-read the original post....I think it was mentioned
543159,ketchenany,2011-01-24 20:58:00,3229, I was in one yesterday afternoon/evening. Yikes we were the only ones eating!!!! Strange.
543163,Twocoda,2011-01-24 21:15:00,4130,actually the best thing to do in Montreal is .......come to Ontario to get away from the rat race...  Seriously though ...break out the camera and try to capture Montreal through the lens...from your perceptive...such as people/buildings/signs/buskers/statues etc..it just might end up being one of your prized possessions
543188,siwash,2011-01-24 22:22:00,683,"There too much to do!! great city.. lived there 2 years...  Just walk the streets... and take it in! Old Mtl, The Plateau and St Laurent are but a few spots to walk  like corn beef? Fo to Swhartze's"
543200,Big Cliff,2011-01-24 22:54:00,6899,"Well, if you end up down at St. Laurent and Main and some young lady named Chantell(well young to me)   asks if you know Big Cliff from Ontario, tell her you think I moved to some place in China or something and haven't been heard from for years ok.   Oh, and watch out for that boy friend of hers,Johnny, that bugger carries a gun. He isn't a very good shot but he isn't afraid to try!"
543213,Twocoda,2011-01-24 23:09:00,4130, Chantell is my moms name...and she talks of a Big Cliff all the time ...  Daddy??? is that you ???
543223,Big Cliff,2011-01-24 23:26:00,6899," Son, do you know where your two sisters and your brother are? Better yet, do you know where Johnny is?"

Metcalfe is one block west of Mansfield.  The Montreal Junior Team is leading the Quebec Leaque, they play in Verdun, take the Metro.

543655,HTHM,2011-01-26 02:53:00,4082,"Good conversation and good food in that order was the theme of the evening, I am glad that we got together, and that package will be put to good use at home!

543142,Gregoire,2011-01-24 19:54:00,1397,"If I had one night in Montreal I would grab and few beers at Au Dieu Du Ciel and a sandwich from Schwartz's. I would consider Chez Paree over anything on St Catherines. Less touristy...but you can run in to more celebrities At Supersex. A Frins of mine once met Hulk Hogan and had him sign his Hulster Wallet. If you want a good steak try Moishe's, Le Queue De Cheval, or Gibby's in Old Montreal. If you want to bar hop go on St Laurent. Start at Biftek, Cross the Street and walk a bit to Le Pistol for a sanswich and beer. Cross again and hit up BLizzarts and the Blue Dog. Keep walking to north turn right on Mont Royal and head to Bily Kuhn. (I hope these places are still open) Head to a bring your own wine French Bistro (lots of them on the Plateau) L'Academie is a nice bring your own wine italian resto on St. Denis. It's a great city. I miss it. Have fun, and don't be afraid to stare at the beatifull women, if you don't you'll be looking at the ground or the sky."
