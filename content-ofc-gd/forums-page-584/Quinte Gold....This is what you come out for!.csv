543738,thatleetboy,2011-01-26 14:08:00,143," Absolutely mind blowing...  I would say that *you* are the stuff of legend now, my man!   Cheers"
543913,Slop,2011-01-26 20:28:00,151,I knew it was going to be a slob the way you lads were hovering around the hole waiting for that magic moment topside. Congratulations on a tank of a fish and the fact that you slid her back into the icy water.
543984,ehg,2011-01-26 23:06:00,2666,That is an incredible fish Hard to believe but there are some more near 15lbers there.
544007,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-27 00:15:00,655,"Wow, that is an absolute tank! Congrats!"
543623,Abberz,2011-01-26 02:00:00,140,"14.8lbs of pure Quinte Gold.     Measurements were 33""x19""  It's still swimming if you want to try to catch her tomorrow....  Big thanks to my friends Dave and Larry for being a part of the adventure!"
543624,cwpowell,2011-01-26 02:02:00,265,Beauty.
543626,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-26 02:03:00,2690,"Very nice fish!!!!  Hoping to get there in two weeks, pretty much the anniversary of my 10 lber through the ice last year...she was 29 X 19"".  Hopefully I catch her again this year"
543629,Gregoire,2011-01-26 02:07:00,1397,Wow...what a hog. Congrats
543630,hammercarp,2011-01-26 02:10:00,964,Great fish.

543637,kickingfrog,2011-01-26 02:17:00,8333,That would have eaten' mine for a snack. What size hole is that?
543647,Nipfisher,2011-01-26 02:40:00,2449,I don't normally like big girls.......but she's pretty. Great job on the release.
543651,Abberz,2011-01-26 02:49:00,140,"Thanks guys....8inch hole...problem with the 10"" Jiffy tonight as we ripped the cord right out of it LOL.  Felt really good to release a trophy!"
543654,Rod Caster,2011-01-26 02:51:00,5784,You should have released it in nipissing so I can catch it.   nice goldeye
543658,kickingfrog,2011-01-26 02:58:00,8333," I ask because, while we were out Saturday, we talked about the likelihood of getting a really big walleye out of a 6 inch hole. Alas, I did not get to find out that day."
543664,Abberz,2011-01-26 03:07:00,140," With a 6 inch hole according to pi it woulda been a squeeze at 18+ inches dia.  We almost always use our 10"" jiffy auger. I spuded out my first hole of the day pretty big probably around 12"", but I moved and got lazy....woulda been heart broken to see that come off at the hole."
543670,trapshooter,2011-01-26 03:14:00,1234,Congrats on a true pig!! Nice to see you let it swim too.  Hope you've got plans for a replica mount.
543681,kickingfrog,2011-01-26 03:42:00,8333," Sure, at home it's easy, but out on the ice, with mitts on, decimals are hard to work with."
543684,Moosebunk,2011-01-26 03:52:00,3970,"My buddy and I were packing up when he says to me, ""that guy is into a good one.""  You and your friends handled it well and had it down the hole in no time.  I saw you hold it up for the pic and thought... Great fish... and geez, guess we should have set-up 50 yards in that direction.  Congrats dood!  That's what we do it for right there."
543685,stasbrute,2011-01-26 03:56:00,206,"what a porker, very nice!!!"
543689,Drew_10,2011-01-26 04:43:00,111,"Sweet beer,  Oh, and that walleye ain't bad either! congrats!"
543691,limeyangler,2011-01-26 05:02:00,5204,"Thats a HAWG!  My co-worker happened to glance across at my screen and declared....""WOW!...thats either a very large fish or a very small man""....i told her it was the former.  Great post!"

543711,Abberz,2011-01-26 12:04:00,140," Wait a sec, are you telling me I had a chance to meet the man, the myth, the OFC legend tonight?  Would have been great to meet you in person....I've been a huge fan of your wild adventures for years.  The funny thing is, we would have liked to fish our spot from last weekend that was producing numbers, but no size. It was about half way between us where it was very slushy, not sure if you saw that or not?  We'll have to hook up for a fish sometime....I didn't know you were in the area!  Chris"
