544494,Rod Caster,2011-01-28 01:37:00,5784,"8mm beads might outweight the blades and cause them to spin less freely. Make one and try it in the water...in my opinion, you will need bigger blades and thicker line. I've made some cool looking harnesses that totally fail with a water test...it's all about balance.
