For the past years, I have always had a Humminbird Piranha...good for depth and detecting weeds, but not much else.  I would love to get a GPS unit with maps, but my budget is around $500.00.  Since I really know nothing about sonar, any advice would be greatly appreciated."
544293,mercman,2011-01-27 17:43:00,7054,BPS Has the new humminbird 587 hd Ci on for under 5. I picked one up after christmas cause they had good reviews. I will be using it this summer.Lowrance has a few nice models also just under 600
544325,bigmac1984,2011-01-27 18:31:00,193,"  If you can afford about $200 more, I'd recommend the HDS-5 (I have the 7 and love it)....  For 550 though you can get a very nice unit in the Elite 5 from Lowrance that has basic mapping abilities.  I recomment going to RadioWorld if you can, they have all units on display, and the staff are extremely helpful. Bought my HDS-7 there.  http://radioworld.ca/index.php?cPath=4_95&filter_id=9"
544351,sneak_e_pete,2011-01-27 19:50:00,540,Thanks for the input.  Just stopped by my local shop and picked up a 587ci combo unit on sale for $400.00....good deal?  Good unit?
544363,sneak_e_pete,2011-01-27 20:15:00,540,"Sorry. one more question...I didn't get the HD unit...what's the difference between the ci and the ci HD?  Also, is the ci HD a combo unit?"
