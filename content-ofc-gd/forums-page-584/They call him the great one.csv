543960,misfish,2011-01-26 22:12:00,29133,To me the greatest playa was Bobby Orr #4  But happy 50th Wyane.You are    aswell and done our country   .Please pull yer head out of Bettmans   http://bleacherreport.com/articles/585965-wayne-gretzky-troy-aikman-brittany-favre-and-wednesdays-late-sports-news/entry/44427-wayne-gretzky-hockeys-great-one-gretzky-thinking-of-suiting-up-at-50
544009,tb4me,2011-01-27 00:22:00,3295,"did you all realize that even if you took away Waynes 844 or so goals he would still hold the point lead all time!!! Amazing player....Best of all time IMO. I will never forget that rant on the media in salt lake....his words like ""its a croc of crap"" and ""it sickens me"" then the boys go and get us Gold against team USA...oh baby I wish he would get back into Canadian hockey!!! Wyane comming from me a 36 yr old you da man!!!!!!"
544011,aplumma,2011-01-27 00:32:00,6896,"I thought that "" the great one"" phrase was for Wayne Gretzky? Not to take anything from a great ledgend like Bobby Orr.   Art"
544014,uglyfish,2011-01-27 00:37:00,981,He was great. But maybe 3rd or 4th best ever.  Bobby orr best ever. Mario lemieux was better then gretzky And mourice richard wasn't too shabby either
544016,misfish,2011-01-27 00:38:00,29133," That would be media hype.IMO. Like saying Mario was the next great,and now Crosby.Look at the games played and the guys they played against in thier time.Oh and who WHINED about being hooked and grabed and pushed over,like a WUSS."
544061,uglyfish,2011-01-27 02:02:00,981,didnt hurt having dave semenko and marty mcsorley as ur personal bodyguards either
544077,Grimace,2011-01-27 02:54:00,2020,Just look at the numbers.   Incredible.  http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=2035
544090,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-27 03:25:00,2690,"You really can't argue ""Gretz's"" numbers.  Personally my favorite players would be Bobby Orr (he changed the game for D-men), Darryl Sittler (skills, class and heart!!!!!!!!!!!!), Lanny McDonald (trading him was quite possibly the biggest of all Leafs screw ups, and there have been many!), and, Mike Bossy-he didn't score as many goals as Gretz or a few others, but, there weren't too many, if any, more ""natural"" goal scorers.  Ooops, left out Cam Neely...power forward ""extraordinaire"""
544118,Pigeontroller,2011-01-27 04:15:00,2793,His records speak for themselves.
544152,Whitespinnerbait,2011-01-27 10:13:00,2038,  Great Minds think alike.   Can you imagine if Wayne was just starting out in todays Game ................He would not get anywhere near those numbers
