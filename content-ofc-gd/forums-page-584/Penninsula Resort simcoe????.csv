543708,fishing n autograph,2011-01-26 11:44:00,2540,"Not sure about the resort, but I was there yesterday while searching for a missing person. The staff seemed really nice and friendly and there is an ice road right off the parking lot onto the lake. Not a bad spot"
543710,Jer,2011-01-26 12:02:00,1426,Didja find them?
543715,fishing n autograph,2011-01-26 12:24:00,2540,"Nope not yet....see the local news for any info, I'm pretty sure a press release was issued"
543768,Beans,2011-01-26 15:06:00,3339," I've never stayed there overnite but used to book a hut, had breakfast in the dining room, and had lunch delivered to the hut as my birthday gift to my grandson until he turned twelve and they wanted full price for him... Jerry tried to put us on fish best he could...  Following year we bought an auger and enjoyed extra trips each year until he discovered girls...   "
544028,brkygetr,2011-01-27 01:13:00,425,"Well I guess I am just going to find out for myself...anyone have any ice reports north of Georgina? I hear huts are starting to gather but no actual ice conditions???? Plan is for a perch bonanza on Friday and then a Saturday of 50 holes, reluctant fish and possible sled problems!!!(Sound typical  )  Anyways any recent deep water ice conditions would be appreciated.  cheers all  Dale"
544035,fishing n autograph,2011-01-27 01:23:00,2540,"there are huts everywhere off of virginia beach.....ice looks pretty good, well, at least it did from the road....i drove all along the lake yesterday and there were people everywhere"
544049,brkygetr,2011-01-27 01:43:00,425,  Plan is to clear the pack and get deep...and no doubt the perch grounds were packed...I am kind of dreading it on Friday but we can't spend a weekend without getting into a mess of eagle food (that one is for you Simon)... all I need is one trout to get my jig-on...so to speak!
