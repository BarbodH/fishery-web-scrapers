543754,JohnF,2011-01-26 14:48:00,3494,There seems to be a lot of interest in music from the members here. We already know that there are some very talented musicians in our midst but what about the others who are too shy to share their music or who have talented family members doing some recording?  My own family is quite musically inclined but I'm at the weak end of that chain. Not that I'm tone deaf or anything but I gave up the banjo in frustration years ago. If you hear some of my family's stuff you'll understand why.  Is anyone interested in posting samples for the rest of us to enjoy? Ice reports seem to be slowing down and it's still a few months till soft water is with us again so let's do a little bragging.  JF

543799,JohnF,2011-01-26 16:25:00,3494,"Every one of you has probably heard my little brother play. He worked on the HNIC theme for years as well as the Canadian Olympic TV coverage. Till he told me I didn't even realize there were guitar lines in the HNIC theme. He has often written and performed the background music for the Olympic athlete cameos you see on tv. When someone wins something he'll get a call in Stratford asking for the music for the vid asap. He works straight thru until it's done and dubbed on the vid, then he sends it to the network electronically for play. He also runs a small studio recording other artists.    Hit the play arrow and wait for the file to buffer. This is just a sample of his guitar playing.  Look up Ali Matthews for more of him accompanying her. He also does a lot of her recording and production as well as accompanying her when she does tv or live hows.  JF"
