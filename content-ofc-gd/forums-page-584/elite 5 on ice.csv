544145,landry,2011-01-27 05:08:00,1005,"I am not much of an icefisher, (mostly just like taking my kids out for panfish and perch) so you can take this for what it is worth but: I just tried my elite 5 lowrance unit on the ice and all i can say is - wow! Jocelyn at Angling Outfitters sold me the ice transducer and battery set-up at a great price so I could use my boat unit on ice. He knows his stuff - sent me to home depot to get a 10 buck toolbox and I mounted the gimbal mount on the lid, drilled a couple of holes and now I have a tackle box/sonar/gps unit all in one for much cheaper than the new lowrance soft ice kit bags. This unit may be better than a flasher but that is a hotly debated topic. The split zoom mode provides bottom zoom up to 4x and you can see your jig in real time on the screen and amplitude scope bar (like a vertical flasher). I was teasing panfish and crappies up from the bottom and could see them closing in - my kids loved it - better than the wii:)  I think this (or a flasher) increases panfish success on ice tenfold - at least for me. It is hard to tell where those tiny jigs are and when u can see your jig and the fish it gives you a huge advantage. Any unit would work too - I am sure Jocelyn could find a ducer that would fit humminbirds too and he has ones that fir eagle and lowrance units for sure - cost about 150 for whole setup. Plus I used the gps to pinpoint the better spots, which may save me some drilling next time with the auger.  Landry"
544153,spincast,2011-01-27 10:25:00,3279,I just bought one from Jos as well (without the ice fishing add ons) Great to hear its all Jos said it was - come one soft water !!!
544167,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-27 12:43:00,2690,"  Good to hear, sounds like a great unit from all reports.  I wouldn't mention humminbird in Jos's shop...just saying"
544175,scugpg,2011-01-27 13:04:00,1373,Landry - show us a pic of your setup! Jocelyn told me about the $10 toolbox but they were out of stock at the time.
544390,landry,2011-01-27 21:31:00,1005,I actually got the box at rona as H.depot was out of stock. If u want pics just PM me with your email and I will send it to you. Landry
544418,lakerguy,2011-01-27 23:14:00,224,I have the same unit and love it.( from Jocelyn)  I bought a small lunch box style cooler.Mounted my gimbal on the lid drilled a hole down for the wire lead and grooved out one for the ducer.The nice thing about the cooler is thats its insulated.  Wallmart has the mini coolers for around 15 bucks I think...
