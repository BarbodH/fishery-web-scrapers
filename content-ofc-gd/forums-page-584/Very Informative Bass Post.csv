I'm not one to plagiarize, so I'll quote it all, minus the MLA Bibliography.  Originals can be found on: Copying Guy's Post Original?  Just something to think about for the next 20-ish weeks before bass opens."

What were all these fish telling the top 10 â€“ nothing.""  Actually the fish may be telling them they got lucky? Even the top pros don`t win all the time."

Both sides of town housed a bunch of obese fish though.  There are a bunch of people that average out near the top on most tournaments..And the Leafs don't lose every game either! Lol."
