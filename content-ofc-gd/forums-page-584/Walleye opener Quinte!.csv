543488,superdad,2011-01-25 18:01:00,353,Saw that when I first looked at the calendar last year to figure out the opening weekend dates.  I'll have my son visit to fish Sat/Sun and visit his mother later on Sunday for supper.  Works for me.  David  aka  Superdad

543748,Harrison,2011-01-26 14:32:00,2202,"Actual email I just sent to my Mom.  Hey Mom, you know that fishing weekend Phil and I do every May?  Well guess what, if falls on Mothers day this year.  Therefore, we would love for you to join us.  What a great way to celebrate - you, us, and 10 other rough and tumble guys.  I have already let the guys know a woman may be coming.  So they have agreed to only fart and burp outside, use fully clothed ladies on our deck of cards, to keep a swear jar handy and we will do all the dishes after you cook.  Even Dane has agree to not walk around in his tighty whities for you.  So let me know Mom.  Sounds like a blast eh!  Of course, if you can't make it we'll stay home with you, because we love you so much and totally understand sometimes family members must make sacrifices on special days.  Lovingly your understanding son,  Paul  (Paul should never of gave me his email password)"
543785,superdad,2011-01-26 15:45:00,353,Blakewoods is on Hay Bay and close to the hot spots on the opening weekend.  You'll see the boats from your front door.  Lotsa Luck on the opener  David  aka  Superdad Hay Bay @ Bayview Resort
543801,POLLIWOGG,2011-01-26 16:30:00,835,"Give them what they really want, A few days without you.  I used to take Dad fishing every Sunday but I stopped because it left Mom awfully busy on her own.  The other day she said how great it was to have us gone for the day."
