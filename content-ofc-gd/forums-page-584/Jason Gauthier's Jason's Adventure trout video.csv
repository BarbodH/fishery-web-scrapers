I would like to introduce myself to the members here, My handle is Buffalo Point Slow jigger as that is where I have done a lot of my early years of fishing! I am 41 years old and have fished almost all my life after 5 years old! I am not  the best angler but I have a lot of fun at it and am lucky enough to get out lots.I would always be willing to learn and accept tips from anglers  on any species! I am a member of the lund pro Staff as well as the MC for the Angler and young Angler championship series and co coordinate the stage show with Jason Hamilton, we team up to make it as exciting for the families as we can! I also am part of the Adventures North Television series  with a mini show within a show called Jason's Adventure which features close to here destinations. I also make some you tube videos with my pals on some of our outings! Hope to maybe get out to do some steel head fishing some time down in and around the Sault!  Thanks again for the comments  Jason Dean Gauthier"
