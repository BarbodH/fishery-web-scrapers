Such a game of timing and wanted to stay away from the crowds out there.  Fishing has been getting better and better since the beginning of the season though and we're all getting fish now.  Got a few fish on video this week, figured I'd share it with you guys. Havent really had a hot bait out there, caught them on jigging raps, bad boys, spoons, tubes and laker takers. Enjoy!  Beware of possible foul language, I cant control em all haha  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi6tovlYdlA"
