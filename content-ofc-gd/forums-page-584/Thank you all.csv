543762,GBW,2011-01-26 14:57:00,8460,I just wanted to say THANK YOU to all of you for your kind words and thoughts over the past few days.  It was hard to go through (again)  but we all (my family) know she's better off. I think I've been a pallbearer more in the last 3 years then I've gone to weddings in the past 7 years. Thanks. Geoff
