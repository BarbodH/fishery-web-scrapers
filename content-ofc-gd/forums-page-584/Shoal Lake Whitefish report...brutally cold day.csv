Unlike last year there was not really an iceroad...going was bumpy, i got stuck at one point too. First spot we hit seemed like it was gonna be a banner day. before everyone had a line down Mark's girlfriend got into a nice fat 4lber. I dropped my transducer down the hole to watch my jig greeted by 3 large whitefish signals chasing my jig all over the water column with one committing to bite after 30 secs......then nothing! Even the hundreds of tulibee and perch on screen which hit hard last year would not touch anything sent down the hole....strange ???  After a few hours at that spot we hit the next spot...slightly deeper at 60'FOW......not even much bait fish on screen...i had a couple of whities follow my jig....no takers. Mark's girlfriend cooked a ground beef and beans concoction which was simple but freekin' delicious and Snakehunter set the bed of his truck on fire making burgers for evertyone which were equally tasty and well received on a brutally cold day.   LUNCH......HOT FOOD ON A FREEZING DAY.....AWESOME!    After about 2 more hours we were about to pack up when Mark's girlfriend landed another whitie...we decided to stay but after no repeat customeers at the holes we headed to another spot. This time slightly shallower in around 40'-46' FOW. Right off the bat i got a couple of nice fish...around 4-5lb. Then Lew got into one for his second of the day. All this time the others were not getting a thing...and save for a jackfish i landed some 45 minutes after the last whitie that was it fish wise for the day. It was brutally cold and windy but fun as usual, we all decided to hit that lake again IN THE SPRING WHEN ITS NOT SO FRIGGIN COLD!  The conditions were not conducive to filming but i got a few of the fish landed on video...........  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" class=""youtube-player"" type=""text/html"" width=""480"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/mtiVNzMXZQY"" frameborder=""0"" allowFullScreen></iframe>"
