544384,Twocoda,2011-01-27 21:14:00,4130,Absolutely the right spot at the right time ...  ok everyone ...see if it was Geo-tagged
544388,daryl0815,2011-01-27 21:21:00,225,That was awesome!
544389,solopaddler,2011-01-27 21:29:00,8605,"Must have been early in the season, that's pretty thin ice. I think I'd be spudding out something a little bigger than the tiny hole he was fishing out of.  If Kenny is from Yellowknife I think you just discovered your new best friend."
544395,drwxr,2011-01-27 21:40:00,453,thats insane!!!
544397,johnnyb,2011-01-27 21:43:00,3413,"Not sure how I feel about the full size rod....on the one hand, it does make sense....on the other....just doesn't seem right.  Sweet video though!"
544400,cwpowell,2011-01-27 22:00:00,265,"  Well, brings the fish up fast. Doesnt tire them out. Doesn't tire you out. Definitely won't make you friends in an ice hut haha."
544401,solopaddler,2011-01-27 22:06:00,8605,  When we fish chinooks through the ice we spud out huge troughs and use full sized rods. Only way to go imo.
