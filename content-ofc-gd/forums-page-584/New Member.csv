542765,pikeslayerjr,2011-01-23 17:33:00,7,"Hi, I just wanted to quickly introduce myself as I am new to this forum. My name is Sean and I am the heir apparent to 'pikeslayer'. I am a first year student @ Fleming College in Lindsay. Typically I fish various lakes in the Seguin region as well as chase salmon & rainbow on Lake Ontario. During my time in Lindsay I am looking forward to exploring and fishing the local Kawartha lakes. So far, I have been very fortunate to meet Big Cliff and am looking forward to spending time together, learning, and lending a helping hand. Although school is my biggest priority, I am hoping to get out on the ice as much as I can. I am definitely a newbie when it comes to ice fishing and have yet to land my first fish through the ice. Anways, Pikeslayer says that this forum is 'first class' & friendly. I am looking forward to being a member and hopefully posting my first report very soon. Regards, Pikeslayer Jr."
