258800,Mattones,2008-10-16 01:42:00,587, Its good to know there are people like you guys that are willing to help a new guy out  I think I may consider going to the Wolf Den near Barrie for my courses. Its a two day course.
257551,Mattones,2008-10-11 18:44:00,587,Has anyone taken them recently? I am meeting up with the guy who will be teaching me on Tuesday to give him the money for the course's. The PAL 2 day course is this coming Sat-Sun and the Hunters is the week after.  $220 for the PAL + $30 for books $200 for the Hunters.  Does this sound right? about paying him before the course? I guess its only right eh? I got his number from this site which to me seems real.  http://www.ohep.net/InstSearch.cfm?Do=City#Result  Oh BTW i bought my first bow today! The Diamond Justice!! 
257559,Sinker,2008-10-11 20:12:00,8692,"That doesn't sound right at all!!! Don't pay anything to this guy!!  A buddy of mine just got his 2 weeks ago. Hunter safety and P.A.L for less than $300.  I'd look around a little more if I were you, they should be the same price everywhere.  I can prolly get you the info you need.......just give me a bit, I""m at work right now, I have it all at home.    Sinker"
257561,Mattones,2008-10-11 20:21:00,587," if its around the Burlington-Oakville, hamilton, Missisauga area that will work."
257568,PAZE,2008-10-11 21:03:00,132,"Call silverdale gun glub a call, they give a coarse every month, and its a hell of alot cheaper then that. 45 minits from burlington"
257570,Mattones,2008-10-11 21:08:00,587,im more so looking for the hunting course I figured i might as well take the P.A.L. But yah i may consider what you said. i will look into it now.
257611,Rich,2008-10-11 23:56:00,3927,Sweet bow dude!
258113,Mattones,2008-10-14 01:49:00,587,Anyone take a course recently near Burlignton where you got your PAL and Hunters?
258124,danbo,2008-10-14 02:15:00,2646,"I gave you the links before. You need a ""Kisser"" Button on your bowstring too."

258127,AzuluSpookd,2008-10-14 02:39:00,348,"Wolf's Den just near Barrie is only 220.00 for both, only a Sat and Sun, but they are very long days and well worth it. I took it there in the spring and they were great."
258130,danbo,2008-10-14 02:54:00,2646,Your local Gun Shop will have all the info you need.  http://www.gtsarchery.com/index_files/Page354.htm
258158,PAZE,2008-10-14 09:51:00,132,"Who set that bow up for you, have you ever shot a compound before?"
258226,Billy Bob,2008-10-14 15:17:00,5865,ALL our safety hunting course here are conducted FREE of charge.  Maybe you should head down here and pass a course  Bob
258241,Fisherman,2008-10-14 16:18:00,7201,"Unfortunately, I don't think your courses would entitle you to get your licence here."
258256,Billy Bob,2008-10-14 17:13:00,5865,"WHY not. If I have a NYS hunting license I then can purchase a Ontario license right ? ? ?  And how did I get my NYS hunting license, by taking said hunter safety training course"

258341,taper,2008-10-14 21:17:00,611,My son and I just did our course last year. The instructor had you pay a partial fee up front and gave you the books to read before the course started. This was to make sure people showed up on the course date. You paid the remainder at the start of the course.
258344,misfish,2008-10-14 21:20:00,29133,"  Not you,the instructor"
258352,Mattones,2008-10-14 21:36:00,587, The bow was as a Package. All i needed was to be fitted. I never shot before but I have a clean shot and good posture. Hope to join a club to learn the basics before I go hunting next year.  I will check out the wolfs den.
258386,PAZE,2008-10-14 23:05:00,132," Yes I understand the bow was fitted for you, but did someone measure your draw lenght?, was your rest, and sight squared up, is your bow set up for you. Do yourself a huge favour, and get that bow all set up for you, and have someone that has been shooting for a while show you how to shoot. The best advise I can give you is dont pick up bad habbits you'll never loose them. Oh ya shoot with both eyes open.  Paul"
258417,Mattones,2008-10-15 00:24:00,587, Yah thats all done.  The guy at bass pro who sold me it was the main archery guy there. Nice fellow. Sad i only pull a 60. haha but hey I'm a small guy.
258474,Fang,2008-10-15 02:20:00,1330,"Hey MT  I'm off for moose this Friday and won't be back for a week. I've shot compound from high school through to a few years ago. Had to give it up due to neck injuries. Best is to have a spot that you can fire and setting up the bow is about a 15 minute process. Getting good actually takes a year or so.  You need some type of dead stop target and a safe place to shoot. Start at about 3-4 yards and use your eye to set up your top pin. Line up your target to the top pin through the peep sight. Shoot 1 arrow at a time and adjust the pin until you get a consistent grouping. Move back to 5-7 yards and repeat. You don't need to shoot at any further distance. Once you can shoot consistent 2"" groups at 5 yards then worry about the 20+ yard settings.  If you have a place to shoot and want a hand or some freindly help give me a pm towards the end of October. I live in Oakville and will be abck in town post 27th"
258681,Mattones,2008-10-15 21:06:00,587, Awesome! I will contact you for sure next month
