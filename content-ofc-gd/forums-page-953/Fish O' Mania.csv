259073,misfish,2008-10-16 20:55:00,29133,Ol Red would be proud of that one.LOL Thanks for sharing that.
259104,Cudz,2008-10-16 22:49:00,2652,"Damn, I don't like fish o mania but I have watched 3 seperate championships (yes 3!) from start to finish.  Don't know why but I got caught up in the show somehow. I don't have much time for Shelly and Courteney or whatever the name of that show is.  I love the PTT though.  ""Welcome to Boca pass for weeek 3 of the PTTS!!!"""
259165,MJL,2008-10-17 02:02:00,2427,Is Fish-O-Mania the show where 30 or so anglers fish in an Olympic sized swimming pool/pond for carp?  I don't have WFN but I saw a show something like that on one of the free previews last year.  Wouldn't be my first choice of things to watch but I thought it was OK for the short time I did watch it.  I like watching fishing shows more for their informative aspects rather than pure entertainment. I rarely watch TV fishing shows nowadays.  I find most of them rehash the same content season to season or are rarely (if ever) informative from show to show.  Never really got into bass or walleye fishing (which most shows are based on) so I don't find them all that interesting to watch - even then I find most hosts rarely try different techniques to catch fish.  Example:  How many ways can Chronzy catch walleye jigging gulp minnows on a fly-in lake using ultra-lite tackle?  The only show that I really looked forward to watching was In-fisherman.  Last couple of years I've really gotten into adventure type movies/shows like the Troutbum diaries and my friends from the UK sent me a DVD of a TV show called Jungle Hooks where the host fishes for Mahseer in India and Arapaima in the Amazon.  Also have a number of shows on DVD from Rex Hunt who fishes all across the globe and Matt Hayes who fishes for various species in the UK using a variety of techniques (The Great Rod Race is one of my favourites to watch).

258949,addy79,2008-10-16 15:27:00,573,"Just wondering if you Carp die hards actually watch this show on WFN?  Its painful to watch, and could it be any longer????"
258950,BillM,2008-10-16 15:30:00,17367,"Painful is not the correct word, I am sure we could find something worse"
258952,maybo,2008-10-16 15:33:00,86,"better than ""Welcome to Lunkerville!"" worst TV show ever!"
258955,BillM,2008-10-16 15:39:00,17367,I think Shelley and Courtney take the cake before Lunkerville
258960,bigugli,2008-10-16 15:45:00,6138,About as exciting as Bingo at the nursing home or watching a chess match
258967,johnnyb,2008-10-16 16:10:00,3413,Are you guys saying there is something out there that's worse than Dimestore Fisherman?
258968,Marko,2008-10-16 16:11:00,854,"Carp fishing is awesome, I dont know what you guys are talking about"
258969,Muskieman,2008-10-16 16:15:00,2472,"Does anyone remember ,.I think it was called.."" Casting Out""  .....  It was hosted by Vince MacDonell.... I think he baked the proverbial cake...   As for Fish O' Mania..........  :wallbash:    What the heck?..to each his own I could do without it.  :Gonefishing:   RFS"
258970,addy79,2008-10-16 16:18:00,573,"It's horrible! i cant get over the spectators in the background either! WOW  Shelley and Courtney is pretty dry, but girls handling 8 foot rods is hot!"
258971,kemper,2008-10-16 16:22:00,2232,  I once watched him catch smelt (or some other minnow less than 4 inches) through the ice for half an hour...  wow  what a show
258982,jdmls,2008-10-16 17:11:00,575,  clearly the worst  show ever to hit the tube
258986,misfish,2008-10-16 17:21:00,29133,"Although it is carp fishing,I give the anglers credit on the ways of getting the fish to school on thier bait and thier patiance in bring the fish in. Lots of money in these tourneys. Yes boring at times,but it has it,s place I think."
258991,addy79,2008-10-16 17:26:00,573,"agreed it has its place, but i wonder what the ratings are like??  Seems like a 3 hour filler to me"
258999,mistyriver1,2008-10-16 17:45:00,600,  Couldn't agree more.....and why does it always seem to be on when I have some time to watch the tube
259003,PatrickGG,2008-10-16 17:52:00,562,"Lunkerville aint that bad of a show, I have never seen a 5 pound Largie Pulled out of central park ponds like he did, some of his shows kinda make me laugh.  Can't wait till the Charlie Moore fishing show starts up again on Oct 24."
259016,misfish,2008-10-16 18:23:00,29133,Bring back fish fishburn.LOL
259023,bukee,2008-10-16 18:33:00,58,"""Peg 4 is hot"" has become a favourite saying out on the lake.  Shelley and Courtney...yuk...whatever happened to that fishing show that had the hot chicks in bikini's deep sea fishing.  Sort of like soft porn and fishing..now that was entertainment."
259024,bassjnkie,2008-10-16 18:35:00,1101,"I watch it every Wed. at 10am. I fish the same style, with an elaticated pole, float or feeder with rod and reel. For me I watch it to pick up new methods of fishing and landing the fish. If your into hard core carp fishing, like me, you don't watch it to follow the standings. The quys fishing are champions and their tecniques change every match they fish. I actually picked up a lot from Fish O Mania. Yes it's boring once in a while.  Lunkerville really does suck!!!!!!!!!!!"
259026,azanier,2008-10-16 18:41:00,23,  LOL I remember him that guy was classic!
259032,bushart,2008-10-16 18:47:00,2628,"No offence to the carp guys but this ""Fish -O-Mania"" show should have the suicide hot line # scrolling along the bottom.  And I agree bring back Fish Fishburne and team Gramma---there's a guy who did'nt take the show too seriously---a lot of these TV ""Experts probably just learned the technique the day before---but it's important to the ego to be the Giver of Knowledge.  At least Chronzy I can laugh at---you never know who he wants to push off the end of the dock in one of his fireside chats---Hey Darrell---how many sheep did you have to shear to get that sweater?  OK I'll Stop now......  Bushart"
259036,misfish,2008-10-16 19:07:00,29133, 
259039,Mike Pike,2008-10-16 19:13:00,1332,"I caught that show once at my friends place( I don't get WFN with stupid Cogeco in Hamilton ).  Anyhoo, I actually liked it!  Then again, we did have a few beverages that probably hightened the viewing experience.  I thought the competition was pretty interesting but definately NOT a fun way to carp fish with those crazy poles!"
259043,Marko,2008-10-16 19:24:00,854,"Two best shows that I`ve seen on WFN are Musky Hunters and the Tarpon Tournaments, not sure what the show is actually called but its the craziest thing I`ve seen. 50 Boats in about 100 Sq meters catching 150-200 pound fish and fighting off the sharks. Does not get much better"
259053,sharper,2008-10-16 19:43:00,279,I don't mind watching it for a bit but after awhile it does get boring.
259057,bassjnkie,2008-10-16 20:00:00,1101,"I guess you have to have the passion to watch Fish O Mania. I don't disagree with everyone, I could get boring at times. Pole fishing for carp is actually fun. For me I find Musky, fly, salmon, fishing flats, deep sea and the bass tourney shows boring.  Linder is an ok show, Charlie Moore, scott martin, roland martin, Jimmy Huston are the shows I like most. Lunkerville is a joke, and I am not keen on the Hook and Look show.  Daniel"
