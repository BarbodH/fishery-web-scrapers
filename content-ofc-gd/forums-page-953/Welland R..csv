Rockfish gave me the perfect excuse to launch the boat and get away from the house Monday.  It was a gorgeous day out. Unfortunately the fish weren't cooperating. Rockfish got a 15"" walleye and we got a smattering of nice perch and rockies. All released to fight another day.   not really a pic worthy day.  Still better than spending a 4th day at home packing. We are finding downsizing a very difficult thing to do."
258176,evster,2008-10-14 12:47:00,367,It sure was a nice weekend!!!  I actually was out on the Welland on Saturday for a few hours.  Only one small bass but the beautiful day made it worth it!
258179,johnnyb,2008-10-14 13:02:00,3413,"Beautiful weather, and a very good idea to get out on the water.  My parents are having the same difficulties downsizing...well, to be more specific, my mother is   It's hard to throw away things that bring back memories, even when you haven't looked at it in years... good luck"

258480,rockfish,2008-10-15 02:34:00,91," Thanks for the boat ride Bruce, always a good time drifting a few of your custom made Uglyboy worm harnesses and the Wally took the white pattern this time in the clear water. The girlfriend also got a chance to work on an October tan since she lost her paper temp. fish license in her laundry a few weeks ago. Still looking for those Fall time Pike for the NFN Pike off contest but still tons of time before it ends March 31 when the inland season closes.  "
