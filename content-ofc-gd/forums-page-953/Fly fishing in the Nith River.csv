258372,Carlitoboy,2008-10-14 22:34:00,5,"Hey folks!  I've just recently got hooked on fly fishing.  Spent most of my time in waders, fly fishing for Salmon over the last few weeks in the currently legal sections of bronte creek and credit river.  Caught a couple nice salmon!  I'm looking to hunt for trout next; browns and rainbow.  I've noticed that Nith River is an option for trout and other species like pike and small mouth, and from what I understand the season isn't closed after sept 30th, like all the good spots are on bronte and the credit.  It's pretty much open for catch and release.  Has anyone been fishing this river this fall as of late?  Cheers!"
258382,fatherof3,2008-10-14 22:56:00,1769,"Going by the regulations,the Nith is now closed for trout but Pike are open until Dec 31 and Bass are open until Nov 30.I saw no mention of the Nith specifically but the extended season for trout on the Grand river is further down then where the Nith flows into it.Trout seaon on the Grand is open until Dec 31 from 100m downstream of the hwy2 bridge in Paris(southend).Lots of places for you to try flyfishing there.hope this helps.By the way,have only heard of one trout being caught in the Nith."
258392,Carlitoboy,2008-10-14 23:17:00,5,Thanks for the info fatherof3!  Where exactly did you get the regulation info for Nith River?
258394,danbo,2008-10-14 23:38:00,2646,
258576,Carlitoboy,2008-10-15 14:24:00,5,"Thanks.  I actually use this site quite diligently for regulation information before I go out on the hunt.  I think it's pretty clear that Nith River is in Zone 16.  In the Fisheries Management article for Zone 16, there is no mention of the Nith River... ???"
258592,NAC,2008-10-15 15:32:00,369,  It won't if there are no Additional Opportunities or Exceptions.
258593,BillM,2008-10-15 15:32:00,17367,"It will only mention it if there is an exclusion.  If it's not mentioned, the season closed on the 30th of Sept."
258664,Carlitoboy,2008-10-15 19:46:00,5,"Got it.  I guess it's sort of an unwritten rule then?  All together it's all good; keep the trout healthy and safe until next season.  I'll chuck flies for smallies in the Nith River then.  Anyone having any luck going for trout in any ""open"" areas near the GTA this fall?"
258766,timmeh,2008-10-16 00:47:00,609,"No it is a written rule. If you're fishing in zone 16 you should always assume the trout season is close on sept 30 as per the regs unless there is a specifically mentioned exception. They obviously can't list all the waters that close on the standard date.  I'm not trying to be rude to you at all here, just making sure you understand, so you don't find out from an angry conservation officer."
258848,Musky or Specks,2008-10-16 03:19:00,2710,Yes its a writtin rule and if you know were to look the Nith gets a good run of steel and drop back opportunities exist in the spring.
258849,kemper,2008-10-16 03:23:00,2232,"  that would involve actually SEEING a conservation officer.  Kinda sad isnt it? Knowing that you could fish illegally for years without the risk of getting caught. I have been fishing one trib a couple times a week for 4 or 5 years now and I ONCE saw a CO, and he didnt even ask for my license."
258851,danbo,2008-10-16 03:26:00,2646,We gotta help others is all. Report violators or at least warn 'em. It's up to all of us to protect the natural world. Fish on!
