Everyone had a blast and another date was set for this weekend. I enjoyed the walk and the opportunity to scout some waters that I had not fished before.  Does anyone have some suggestions for a enjoyable family walking destination that is near some trout habitat, that I could have a look at. We are all fit and able, my 10 year old daughter is up to a challenge. I've fished the lower reaches of the Humber, Credit, Wilmot and Rouge. Its really more about a walk, than the fish but.....  We would like to get out in the country, but not too far from downtown Toronto say 1/2 to 1hr.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Hairywater"

258897,dheitzner,2008-10-16 11:53:00,314,"Try the hike down to the whirlpool down in The Falls. I'ts beautiful down there this time of year, and quite an invigorating hike! Darcy"
258920,hairywater,2008-10-16 13:13:00,15,Thanks for the suggestions.
258928,BillM,2008-10-16 13:55:00,17367, I probably wouldn't bring kids down there.  The trail down can be a bit challenging.
258936,ketchenany,2008-10-16 14:34:00,3229,"If you are ever in the Collingwood area be sure to stop by the Thornbury Fish Ladder, it is a sight to see at this time of year. There is also a park just south of that in Clarksburg where fish stage before heading up river."
258976,jdmls,2008-10-16 16:41:00,575,The Ganny is a nice sight ...You could also try the Streetsville dam on the Credit...The Humber with its multiple Dams is still your best bet though.
259048,sharper,2008-10-16 19:33:00,279,"Try the hike down the Glen inside, it's an easier hike then whirlpool."
259116,Streamerguy,2008-10-16 23:24:00,121,"here's a pic of how the Whirlpool looks at this time of the year!!    This pic is of how we get down there,it usually takes a good 10 min down the stairs but only 2 min this way(not for the very young or old to try)    It's a beautiful place to see and anyone can make it up and down the stairs no age limit....just be careful when you get to the bottom as it is a very fast current ,if you stay on the trails you won't have nothing to worry about!!  just not the trail in the pic above  Have a great time,wherever you decide  cheers Streamerguy"
259121,highdrifter,2008-10-16 23:42:00,2534," Remember, there's no fishing within 30m downstream of the wiers..  Some great pools up from Old Mill on the Humber though..  You might just get lucky!  Good luck HD"
