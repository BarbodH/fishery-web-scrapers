258748,snagmaster,2008-10-15 23:42:00,250,"A few of my buddies and I go up to Gbay every thankgiving to hunt and fish. The scenery is gorgeous, the fishing is hit or miss and the hunting is toughbut still my favorite place to visit. Got up to Gbay on friday afternoon and setted up for the duck hunt. Not to many dcuks buzzing around probly do to the heat but got a few and my budy nich shot two woodcock. We were planning on grouse hunting on saterday but Woodro and I wanted to check out the fishing first. Checked out an old smallie spot first thing in the morning and hooked into this 36 and a half inch pike....very wide back on her.   release shot  Continued working the spot and Crazy nick my fishing partner for the weekend picked up a couple 2lb smallies....Woodro and stelooch picked up a couple of smallies too but it was a tough bite tho. On the way back to the lodge for lunch we stopped at woodros Largie spot . I picked up one nice one and woodro got 2 or 3.   Got back to the Cabin and had a fiest.We ate Woodros Buck all weekend and boy was it tasty....By the way congrats woodro on your first deer. We were supose to go out for the duck hunt again but I knew nothing would be flying so we went fisihng again...went back to our smallie area...Missed a few nice fish as they werent very active but Crazy Nick picked up a 5.2lber and a 2lber....Thats his new personal best smallie.   went back to the cabin and drank our faces off and had a blast. The next day was the tourny between the two boats. we Both went out for smallies first thing in the morn but all we could hook was small pike and i lost one hog....Around !pm I siad to nick we should check out the largie spot  but he wanted to stay on the smallie pattern ...big mistake...we headed back to the cabin at 2pm fpr lunch and woodro had 5 nice largies in the well and we had nothing....But it wasnt over yet...weigh in was at dark...we ate like champs again and headed out.....woodro and stelooch took an hour nap because they thought they had it in the bag....we got to the spot and within an hour and a half we hooked 11bass....and they were hogs...I got two 5lbers and one just under in 15 minutes.heres a few of the fish. my 2 fivers  neekos with some fish  another hog   we caught our limit and figured we had them beat so we headed over to the smallie spot for the evening.....Met back up with woodro after dark at the spot to weigh in and release the fish. We weighed in 22lbs 13ounces and woodro and stelooch weighed in 21lbs 4ounces....that was our best five fish.....they were shocked....got out for a few hours on monday morning and the largies were on again as soon as the heat picked up....Nick and I caught 7 more and i lost one that made my fives look tiny...Must have been 6 or 7 lbs...no joke.   a 4lber with some serious teath marks..must have been a big ski   was an awesome trip. cant wait to go next year and get that 7lber...lol.....thanks for reading guys and goodluck on the water"

258925,Cudz,2008-10-16 13:44:00,2652,Nice fish!! That is a big bag of fish. My buddy won the snowflake bass tournament both days out of Midland on the bay. He gor 22+lbs on day one and 24+lbs on day 2.  His total was 46 and change for 2 days.  The bay is on fire.  Both smallies and largies.  He told me he could have caught 7 limits on the Sunday if he wanted and he said if he one more hour to fish he would have had a 25 pound bag. I work on Georgian Bay so I know it is a tremendous fishery at times.
