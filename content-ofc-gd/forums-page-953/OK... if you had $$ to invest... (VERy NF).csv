Longer term most analysts are still bullish on energy seeing it hit $150 by the end of 2009.  There are some good deals to be had with Suncor, Oilexco, and I don't think you could possibly go wrong with EnCana over a 2 to 3 year timeframe.  The decline in the market has also significantly driven up the yield on a lot of the income trusts.  If you are not averse to risk, HCI.UN is yielding approx 17%, and if you want a sin play as one of the other posters on this thread suggested, LIQ.UN also has a decent yield and owns a significant portion of the western Canada liquour market.  Personally, I am sitting in cash waiting for signs that some of the measures taken by the central banks are having an impact.  There were apparently some loopholes that will allow banks to take advantage of the bailouts without helping main street America and that concerns me a bit."

Samurai Bank is soldiering on following sharp cutbacks, Ninja Bank is reported to have taken a hit, but they remain in the black.

When you get there that lane stops and the one you were in before moves.  Think of the long term, if you buy mutual funds on a biweekly or monthly basis DO NOT stop investing during times like these. You will get more units of your investment and with dollar cost averaging you will be ahead in the long run."
258041,Wild,2008-10-13 21:36:00,704,"Once upon a time, in a place overrun with monkeys, a man appeared and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $10 each. The villagers, seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the forest, and started catching them. The man bought thousands at $10 and as supply started to diminish, they became harder to catch, so the villagers stopped their effort. The man then announced that he would now pay $20 for each one. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again. But soon the supply diminished even further and they were ever harder to catch, so people started going back to their farms and forgot about monkey catching. The man increased his price to $25 each and the supply of monkeys became so sparse that it was an effort to even see a monkey, much less catch one. The man now announced that he would buy monkeys for $50! However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on his behalf.  While the man was away the assistant told the villagers, ""Look at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has bought. I will sell them to you at $35 each and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each."" The villagers rounded up all their savings and bought all the monkeys. They never saw the man nor his assistant again, and once again there were monkeys everywhere.       Now you have a better understanding of how the stock market works."

255332,Master of Bait,2008-10-04 06:20:00,196,"Become a day trader TJ!  The wild volatility in the equity markets these days presents an opportunity for arbitrage - HA!  Actually, I'm sure you don't really want to do that.  Just be careful out there.  Resource/energy stocks and associated commodities are SUPER volatile these days - generally not moving based on fundamentals (check out that TSX this week).  No one would have thought that big huge firms like AIG/Wamu/Wachovia and the 3 deceased I-banks would be allowed to fail (okay, they were seized, but shareholder wealth was wiped out).  Even fixed income securities are going crazy because of what's going on in the credit markets.  Be careful with financials, too, because really healthy US banks are not priced at a huge discount right now (massive bank Wells Fargo is near an all time high right now).  The truth is, it's a great time to go shopping for deals if you're Warren Buffett.  For Schmoes like us, it may be wiser to stand pat unless you have really high risk tolerance levels.  By holding out for a while, you'll no doubt miss some opportunities, but you'll also avoid exposing yourself to significant risks to your principal investment.  Cool thread."

This is a terrible investment right now. 2) Commodities 3) Short selling is incredibly risky in a volatile market like this. What if you short something that rebounds? You can get yourself into some major trouble here.  As non-cool as it sounds, put your money in a high interest savings account and wait for a market reaction to this bailout. Once things start looking better (might be soon, could be as much as a year...I'm betting on 6 months), put your money in an ETF that tracks a major index and you will do well. Amateur investors can rarely beat the index.  I actually haven't lost much money through this whole thing by holding Procter & Gamble (PG), Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and even things like BRK.B. My only losses are in the devaluation of the dollar, but don't get me started.  Or tuck your money into your mattress and start cleaning your guns."

You could always invest in Gold as well.  Only thing that was green on my screen today.  With the bailout out the window the outlook looks pretty bleak.  In situations like this, money managers typically put their cash in Gold. If you decide to go bargain shopping, look for signs of a bottom.  Today wasn't it.  A good sign is when you have a really down day but by close  the markets have rebounded and close up or not down that much.  If you look at charts, it is called a hammer. Good luck."

If your talking 15 plus years down the road, invest in the market. The market always will go up. The rich get richer by buying stocks from people panicking.  The other option is real estate. Location, location, location.   That will be $134.00 Mr. Quesnel."

Crisis is mainly focusing on financial institutions hence most of good financial stocks are at bargain. e.g master card (MA) is around $168 today was around $250 month ago, same with american express is around $32 now, was around $55 month ago. If you want to eliminate the risk factor go with blue chip in pharmaceuticals."
