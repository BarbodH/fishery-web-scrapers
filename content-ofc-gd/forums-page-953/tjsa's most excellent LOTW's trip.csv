258567,irishfield,2008-10-15 13:54:00,26272,Like Lew I missed this as well !  Great to see you out and about and with fish in hand Tom !! .. and on Lake of the Woods no less !!
258583,Wild,2008-10-15 15:06:00,704,Missed or not it's always great to review the years most excellent adventures!
238263,Roy,2008-08-10 13:22:00,13728,"Sounds like a good time, Tom. I've never seen crayfish in such great numbers and out in the open too! Thanks for sharing that."
238265,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-10 13:25:00,2585,"great report!  Loved your report!  those were some crazy little crayfish,  Makes sense why fishing is great there with all those guys around!  Cheers!"
238269,tjsa,2008-08-10 13:36:00,1578,"Thanks everyone.  And Chris, the algae bloom was just starting when I was there. Everything is late starting up here this year with the cooler temps and rain we had in the spring. I only saw the bloom in secluded sheltered little back bays. And, the mayflies were in full hatch also, but we still caught fish. I guess that when you mostly fish for walleye on this lake in 20+ fe et of water, the hatch doesn`t have a significant effect on success. We did not come across too many bass though, so they may have had something to do with that.  Oh, and regarding Bobby`s, I used cash, limited me to a specific value to spend. The credit card did not see the light of day,   :lol:"
238272,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-10 13:37:00,0,Great report. Cool shots of the crawfish and the wildlife. Congrats on your first Musky.
238284,tjsa,2008-08-10 14:05:00,1578,"Thanks Johnny, but I have to laugh at your avatar compared to my picture. My hands were similarly placed, just a wee bit closer together,  I ain`t complaining though, sheesh, I went one for 2 on the ``fish of a thousand casts``."
238285,TJQ,2008-08-10 14:12:00,7806,"Awesome Report !! Glad ya got a bit of a break!  I worked on LOTW for a summer when I was 20, those pictures bring back alot of memories... especially the pelicans.  If im not mistaken, lotw is the worlds largest summer nesting grounds for pelicans, at least i was told that somewhere along the line."
238291,tjsa,2008-08-10 14:27:00,1578," Roy, it didn`t really matter what time of the day, mornings had lots more of them than afternoons, but there were always a few hundred along the beach. On the last day a   barge went by with 2 Bobcat mini-forwarders on them to the cottage just north of us to put in a septic field. The waves from the barge washed a lot of them well out of the water. I walked down the line of them, and man, they can move fast even out of the water. A couple stood their ground, picked them up to see if they were Rusty Crayfish or not. Nope, just the regular crayfish species native to Northern Ontario. Its kinda creepy in a way, go out after dark, and shine a flashlight in the water, and THOUSANDS of eyes light up from them,  One creature I did not want to tangle with on this trip, and they are there for sure, was a snapping turtle. I got this pic off another fishing board, he took the pic pre-fishing for the 2007 KBI,  don`t know how old this guy or girl is, but hazard a guess between 100 and 200 yrs. old.     Those claws are probably longer than my fingers. And look at the mass. No need to turn turtle and hide in your shell when you are this big, although a scraping of the hull might be in order."
238297,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-10 14:37:00,0, My first Musky was similar in size to yours so don't feel too bad.lol It could only get better from here on.lol
238299,tjsa,2008-08-10 14:40:00,1578," I can believe that TJQ, they are everywhere. Kinda hard to think of a seagoing bird(at least to our general knowledge) of mating in the middle if Canada. But the food resource for them is there, so why not. Who knows how they found their way there from the coasts. We have a few hundred in certain lakes in the Thunder Bay district also, mainly on the larger lakes in our area. Suprisingly, not on Lac Des Mille Lac, or Shebandowan, YET. They have recently been seen locally in the Kaministiquia River, and the inner and outer harbour of Thunder Bay."
238302,tjsa,2008-08-10 14:45:00,1578,"  Ohhhh, I am not feeling bad at all, I caught`s a Musky. I was just noticing your avatar, and seeing my pic, and ................well..................."
238312,douG,2008-08-10 15:10:00,2693,"Thanks for a great report, tjsa.  Definitely some things I've not seen before."
238348,Whopper,2008-08-10 18:17:00,2174,Great report Tom!  Glad to see ya get out of the house for more than just a day! Now about that drive.....  6.5 hours???? walk in the park bud!  Sounds like you had a good time and you took some nice pics!  Thanks for sharing!
238368,huntervasili,2008-08-10 19:07:00,1604,Nice going up there with the eyes and Ski's Some great shots... I believe I will be hitting LOTW on my cross Canada trip.
238398,Terry,2008-08-10 20:27:00,14456,great report I need to go there some day
238407,tjsa,2008-08-10 20:48:00,1578,"Thanks again everyone. If I had my lifetime to live over again, I would not get to see, fish, or explore all of this lake. It`s so flipping huge."
238419,Mr. Follow,2008-08-10 21:32:00,34,Great Report but does anyone else here think that looks alot like a smalle Tiger Musky?????
238464,tbayboy,2008-08-11 00:18:00,1497,"Very cool report Tom, those pelican/comorant shots and the crayfish are just crazy.  Love you pike comment, just got of a 4 day Lac des milles lac trip myself and yup, guys up here REALLY don't think much of pike   (Luckily for us Lac was nice us to us again this year).  Thanks for the great report."
238564,Victor,2008-08-11 12:09:00,1609,"That's the report i was waiting for ! Looks like you had a great time and it's beautiful there. Very cool to see the""raft"" of birds as well  Thanks for sharing!"
238607,tjsa,2008-08-11 13:30:00,1578," Yeah, about the pike comment, we really do disdain them up here don`t we.  Lots of other people make pike reports, and I enjoy reading their posts and pictures for sure.  I hate them, they steal my walleye harnesses and presentations all the time. Only tangled with 2 of them this trip, one I landed, a small one, the other, about 7 lbs., one last thrash and beads, clevises, and blades were flying everywhere.  Uhggg........gotta re-tie now"
238627,ccmtcanada,2008-08-11 14:36:00,7971,Fantastic report and pics TJSA!!  Great tos ee you getting out there and enjoying yourself.  Congrast on your first muskie...my first was about the same size too.  Thanks for taking the time to write all that up!  Appreciate the effort!
238720,highdrifter,2008-08-11 19:52:00,2534,"Awesome..  I remember my time spent on that water like it was yesterday!!  I was never the same after that..  Wicked report Brah.  Just wondering though.  How far where you from whitefish bay?  I know the area a little bit from when I was hired as a guide for Tomahawk during college, Dog Bone Reef in particular (available on a hydrograph) where I mostly took the customers who wanted walleye..  Thanks for sharing that! HD"
238943,tjsa,2008-08-12 10:30:00,1578,I was probably about 20 km's northwest of Whitefish Bay at least.
238983,limeyangler,2008-08-12 13:45:00,5204,Great report TJSA.....you almost drove right past my house  to get to LOTW....i was down south at the time......but we live in Dryden on Lake Wabigoon...next time you come up...lemme know...not many members this far north it seems. lololol
258550,lew,2008-10-15 12:28:00,12767,"I was away for most of the summer Tom and missed this story, but it looks as if you had a fantastic trip with some incredible pictures, specially the bear & eagle. Were starting to see Bald Eagles down in the Kawarthas the last couple years and their a very welcome sight........at least to me anyways.  Thanks for taking the time to post this great fish'n tale &  congrats on your 1st ever musky too !!"
258566,corvette1,2008-10-15 13:38:00,1765,great report looks like the too of you had a awesome time
238132,Raf,2008-08-09 21:38:00,3495,"well i'll be....  there are muskies under 40"" in LOTW  great shots tom."
238133,tjsa,2008-08-09 21:41:00,1578," Yeah,there are Raf, and I found a couple, thanks for the tips BTW."
238134,Greencoachdog,2008-08-09 21:41:00,8163,Excellent report and pics Tom!!!  Those Crawdads would have made a heckuva feast!!!
238136,Joey,2008-08-09 21:43:00,9122,"Sweet report Tom.  I love all the pics, from the pelicans rafting to the musky to the bear ears  Congrats on the two firsts, the musky and the sauger.  I caught my first sauger this year too.  Sounds like you all enjoyed yourselves and had half decent weather to boot.  Joey"
238138,tjsa,2008-08-09 21:46:00,1578," Thank you Raf, and Glenn, for responding,  Glenn, Now how did I know you would respond as such, lol  Those guys were only 4"" best,  couple were in the   6"" range."
238143,Leecher,2008-08-09 21:51:00,7832,Great report and pics A good mix bag of fish  Thanks for sharing Leechman
238144,tjsa,2008-08-09 21:52:00,1578," Thank you Joey, it was basically just a fishiing trip, that turned into something else. I am not likely to ever land another Musky or Sauger,s o  this trip was special indeed."
238146,tjsa,2008-08-09 21:55:00,1578," No, thank you for responding, much appredciated Leechman."
238149,Wild,2008-08-09 22:05:00,704,Plenty of fish and mini lobsters plus a bear and birds as well all with incredible scenery now that's a perfect trip in my book and you make me want to head there right now. Thanks for posting this.
238151,modny,2008-08-09 22:13:00,502,"great report,  really roughing it is always an adventure, and staying on an island really makes u feel apart of the wilderness.  i wouldda ran down the shoreline with a net and captured those crayfish as bbait."
238154,tjsa,2008-08-09 22:24:00,1578,"lol, you do not kow the half of it. If you are not seeing one of these guys, then your head is buried in the sand. They were EVERYWHERE!!!!!    It was damn near impossible to not look in a direction and not see one."
238156,modny,2008-08-09 22:41:00,502,thats pretty awesome  thats why the fish grow big there  lots of munchies
238162,JohnF,2008-08-09 22:57:00,3494, Those would be lobsters.  JF
238171,Sandbag,2008-08-09 23:42:00,533,tjsa  Looks like a beautiful trip...  Congrats on the two firsts and thank you for sharing your trip with us.  Cheers  Craig
238179,TennesseeGuy,2008-08-10 00:22:00,957,"Nice report Tom.  You had a good week on LOTW.  I hit Bobby's Corner for the first time in 1972 when it was owned by Bobby and his brother, both crazy guys who were well into curling.  They'd flip a coin for double or nothing on a purchase and a few of our guys thought they could beat the house.  Didn't work because the house was buying at wholesale and they were pretty good coin flippers.  Bobby introduced us to twister tails by giving up a few free samples.  Your report makes me miss LOTW which I haven't fished since 1992.  I was recruited to put together a trip to Totem for 48 contest winners.  We had a super time and caught lots of fish.  I was planning to spend a July week on LOTW this year, but it didn't work out.  Too bad about the long drive.  My tongue is in my cheek as I say I feel sorry for you about traveling so far for good fishing.  I know what you mean about taking so few pictures.  I just returned from a very successful week on LV and hardly have enough photos to put together a decent report.  Sometimes soaking up the action just doesn't leave enough time to pull out the camera."
238185,glen,2008-08-10 01:13:00,2641,Thanks for the report on LOTW.  I see so much about it in magazines.  I sure would like to fish it but it is too far away.  I didnt know there were Pelicans on LOTW.
238187,Musky or Specks,2008-08-10 01:19:00,2710,Awesome report and congrats on your first musky!!!!!!!!!
238235,Daplumma,2008-08-10 10:58:00,1961,Great report Thomas.I dont think I have ever seen a pic of you with a fish. Joe
238238,mattyk,2008-08-10 11:45:00,2110,"thanks for the report, great pictures!"
238240,b2kptbo,2008-08-10 12:09:00,1505,"Great report and pic's, very well done..."
238242,tjsa,2008-08-10 12:23:00,1578," Thanks Connie, and that ``long drive`` of mine I know does not compare you what you do twice a year. Usually I am a day tripper, only 2.5-3 hrs. one way, with fishing in between, lol."
238244,Smokey,2008-08-10 12:27:00,1278,Great report Tom. Of all the lakes I've fished it's my favorite.  Thanks for the report and pics
238256,danc,2008-08-10 13:09:00,4677,"That was a fun and interesting report to read Tom. The ""raft"" of Pelicans is amazing. And I've never seen crayfish exhibit such behavior before. And your first and only Muskie is about 6"" larger than my first and only. Congrats..."
238257,Spiel,2008-08-10 13:12:00,9065,....Great report Tom. Almost made it there 2 summers ago with TEP but ended up staying in Vermillion Bay due to the algae bloom on LOTW. Stayed at an old motel a few blocks behind Bobby's (got the shirt  ) actually right between the tavern and the public launch. I'd go back in heart beat and would definitely take more coin for Bobby's.
