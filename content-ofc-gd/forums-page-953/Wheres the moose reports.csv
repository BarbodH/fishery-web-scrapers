258274,Roy,2008-10-14 17:46:00,13728,"Careful out there TJ. We have a tendency to be  a little more frightened of bears than moose but moosies can lay a serious beatin' on ya if they have their dancin' shoes on.  <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value="""
258275,huntervasili,2008-10-14 17:51:00,1604,"Saw a few cows lately, and a decent bull with a mid 30's spread while grouse hunting... The grouse hunting is really good though, I should have a report soon..."
258281,anders,2008-10-14 18:02:00,1168,it was in the high teens up here this weekend.  Not a good weekend for them.  I have seen some in the back of the trucks and in some trailers travelling back to there home.  More of a good bird weekend than moose.

258551,Smokey,2008-10-15 12:39:00,1278,Hey Brian is this what your looking for.  We went hunting from September 20th till October 4th and this guy fell to my buddies arrow at 17yds. We had lots of action for the full hunt but it was miserable weather with lots of winds and rain this year. But fun was had by all.    Mike
258553,Fang,2008-10-15 12:46:00,1330,I leave Friday for a week in the Temagami outback. Will be hunting north end of Diamond lake and from previous reports will defintiely be packing the 22 for grouse. First week group has sent out no reports other than it's been really warm and windy. Bugs have come back out which makes for a miserable time in the bush.  Supposed to get a little colder next week. Makes it better for calling. Saw a nice bull in the summer. Hope he's still around. Will post a report when I'm back around the 25th
258560,Jen,2008-10-15 13:06:00,833,"One of the things on my list of to do's is Moose Hunting... Someday soon, but in the meantime I love seeing others with huge smiles on their faces as you pull up beside them with one of these on their trailer.  Don't know these guys but boy were they ever happy.  Job well done I'd say!   It is atleast a moose ! LOL  Cheers,  Jen"
