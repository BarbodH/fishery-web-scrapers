We definitely have found them moving in, along with some very large, smallmouths.  Last Sat was very rough out there but we stuck it out and had fun and caught some fish.  I am just going to post a few pics from that day.       Here are some from this Sat.                Cant wait till this weekend and the next and the next and the next and........  It only gets better from here!"

258387,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-14 23:07:00,3761,Nice Report! You guys caught lot's of big fish
258399,Badger Shark,2008-10-14 23:49:00,291, Yea Shawn we have caught some nice fish the past few weeks but we are also privileged to have some very knowledgeable contacts to point us in the right direction and in turn when we head out if we get on the fish we return the info to them.  We most likely will be at Quinte this weekend so if you make it down give us a shout on the vhf.

258410,Mike the Pike,2008-10-15 00:14:00,3421,Awesome report dude one more month and I will be there in cold November.  How much did the walleye weigh Badger?  
258510,Badger Shark,2008-10-15 03:47:00,291," I only weighed one and it was 9lbs, the last smallie was 4.7oz.  I figure the other eye was around the 8lb mark.  The one in the first couple of pics was around 7lbs.  They are only going to weigh more from here on in.  Should start to see some 10+ fish soon!  Cant wait."
258547,corvette1,2008-10-15 12:22:00,1765,nice fish badger shark the big girls are coming
258558,NAC,2008-10-15 13:03:00,369,Looks like a great outing with lots of payoff!
258585,eye-tracker,2008-10-15 15:13:00,89,"Hey Badger, Great news to see you are still catching some fish, gald to see the crank colours and locations have paid off for you.  Good luck again this weekend, I will be out on the water this weekend with a group, as I am running a walleye school on Quinte to introducing a few anglers to big water techniques and equipment.  Chat soon...  -sheldon"
258603,Leecher,2008-10-15 16:15:00,7832,Great reports and pics Don  WOW you guys sure got into quality fish    and the size  You've put in a lot of time and effort on those outings and reward is sweet  Good luck this upcoming weekend and keep those reports coming  Thanks for sharing Jacques aka Leechman
258642,Badger Shark,2008-10-15 18:05:00,291," Jaques yes we spend alot of time on the water and cover alot of it but we dont head out blind, we are privialdged to have some info provided to us and then we head out and just like I said cover alot of water and hope we can get on some fish and find what is working that day. Believe me if we didnt we would be just out there fishing blind.  If people want to learn they should charter Eye-Tracker for a day and you will learn a tonne of things.  He really knows his stuff."
