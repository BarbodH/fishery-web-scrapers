256103,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-07 04:36:00,10439,"Mike It was great having you and Joe join me for a week of slammin' magnum chromers!!!! I was debating wether to start my own post about this years trip to the promised land or just add to yours. So if you don't mind I'll just piggy back on your post. LOL  As Mike said, I have been trying to get him to Alaska to fish with me for 5 years. This years trip started out like the previous five trips. Leave Yellowknife at dawn and start the 3000km trip to South Central Alaska. My route heads south to the McKenzie HWY where I turn west onto the Laird HWY which is 700km of dirt!!!   Pulling into Fort Liard to gas up and had to deal with rush hour traffic!!   On the ALCAN in Northern BC heading into the Northern Rockies.   Once I'm on the Kenai Peninsula this is home   As Mike said the Sockeye returns were down 1/2 million fish so there was a lot less food in the water for the Upper Kenai bows and dollies. This is one of those fish that was malnourished.   Here's Eric (Alaska's Simms & Sage rep) with another skinny trout.   This day with Eric turned out to be one of my most exciting and memorable days ever. We had walked into this hole from the Highway. Not a long journey but a portion is through some bear infested bush. As we were heading out, just about step up onto the bank about 10 yards away a brown bear was coming our way just stepping over a downed tree. By the time she noticed us and stopped she was about 5 yards away!!! So there we were 15 feet from the biggest bear I have ever seen!!! I had my fishing rod in my right hand and my left on the bear spray in it's holster. Luckily she was not agressive and I never even removed it from it's holster. It was very cool to be that close to a bear that was estimated at 10 feet and 100 pounds (by some of the local guides, I guessed it at 800 or so pounds but I didn't bring my scale   ) I wish I was able to get a photo when she was standing in front of the log but didn't have a free hand at the time.   In 2003 I met alot of people who had never seen center pin gear and spent alot of time explaining it's use and extolling it's virtues for fishing rivers. One of the first I explained the gear to my a fellow named Paul. I met him on the Anchor River while steelhead fishing. He was fishing the top of a run and I asked if he minded if I dropped in below him. He said go ahead. I made a couple of drifts and he asked about my setup. I showed him how I could fish water that he couldn't using his fly gear. I flipped my float under some over hanging willows protecting the undercut bank across from me, the float moved down stream a bout 15 feet before dissapearing beneath the surface!!! Minutes later I had a 34"" buck steelie at my feet. Little did I know what I had done to this poor fellow!!! I met him again the following year and he had a center pin!!!! This was the beginning of the corruption of the Alaskan fly fisher. I call Paul patient zero. LOL Now 5 years later there are CP fishermen starting to show up here and there. Paul was a fly fishing guide and instructor and had fly fished for more than 30 years. He has now sold all his fly rods and replaced them with 13 and 15 foot float rods.   My first day of fishing on the Kenai in 2003 was with a guide named Guy Quinten. We went out a couple of times after that initial guided trip as he wanted to see this strange gear I told him I would use after our fly fishing trip. He was amazed at the super long drag free drifts. We reunited this year and I spent some time teaching him how to cast and handle the outfit. Hehehe.............another fly fisherman converted!!!!   Thankfully not all the upper river fish were as anorexic as those first couple.   Another of my Alaskan friends, this is Mike and his Golden Retriever Buddy.   While sitting in our pontoons taking a break we heard come branches snap behind us..........BEAR.....nah Moose.   Next day in the same spot   A little while later a family of otters came out of the same spot. Another friend Tony spends the summers fly in guiding in south central and winters guiding heli skiers in Valdez.........rough life huh?   Tony and I had our own bear encounter. We were fishing on an island and this 500-600 pounder repeatedly tried to come and see us, but he finally got tired of us yelling at him and left.   Here's a couple of new friends Chuck from Anchorage who I had been in contact with on another board prior to this years trip.   And Ricky, a friend of Chuck's who has completed the Iditarod dog sled race 4 times. Both he and Chuck are transplanted Western Newyorkers. Go figure.....   The rest has been covered quite well by Mike.  See you at Christmas Mikey!!!!"
256116,solopaddler,2008-10-07 09:55:00,8605,"Dave, wow man even more incredible photos! Your tale should really be a separate post, hopefully at least a few people get to see your pic's!  Cheers bro"
256164,blaque,2008-10-07 14:33:00,2419,"Not much i can add to the replies here..........you guys know what you have experienced and in your case drifter, will continue to experience. You already know how unbelievably lucky you are.........the biggest inspiration is the two guys that transitioned from western new york, im from western new york.! I could be those guys someday!! LOL. Maybe, somehow?, someway?........Was funny to scroll down and see a buffalo bills logo appear! I DUNNO MAN, i just dont know how i would make a change like that in my life at 38, where do you get the nads to just do something like that?! Id settle for just going out for a week once a year, but i dont even see that happening with where the economy is headed. Its just tough to sit in front of a computer at work and watch people do this...........but so cool at the sametime. COngratulations to you guys, sincerely, for being DO'ERS!!"
256166,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-07 14:57:00,10439, Blaque  I left Southern Ontario 3 Years ago for Yellowknife when I was 43. The decision was easy as I was about to go postal on all the loser driving in the Toronto area. There are way too many with me first attitudes there and I just got tired of it. Dude if you want to do it do it.
256224,blaque,2008-10-07 18:16:00,2419,"i hear you loud and clear drifter.....it may just come to that someday,...... (moving to a spectacular area out west, not going Postal) LOL  Seriously though, I admire you for realizing your dreams and following your heart. Its not something enough of us do and tend to look back in regret. Im sure it wasnt an easy thing just pickin up and plantin down somewhere new and different, i bet it was alot of work, God bless ya man."

I'd been looking forward to this report and it lived up to all the hype.  Thanks for taking the time to put together such a great report Mike.  I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say that we really appreciate it.  I think Billy at Alaska Trout Outfitters has a bunch of new clients reading this now
255034,ehg,2008-10-03 14:11:00,2666,"This could be the best fishing article, post, or whatever i ever read.  May be the greatest gift to this community.

254955,Roy,2008-10-03 10:07:00,13728,"Mike, I was up at 4 this morning for my customary walk around the OFC block. Well wouldn't you know it, your thread just stood out there and the timing couldn't have been more perfect. This is my daily quiet time and today's was just excellent. I took a full hour to carefully read every line of your adventure and to inspect every picture for those great subtleties that you just don't see when you go through a report normally. This is truly a gem of a report Mike and a super start to my day.  I can tell you that when I saw that notice tacked to your first cottage door, my heart sank thinking that you may not have enjoyed the trip as much as anticipated but then, reading on into the adventure everything fell into place. Just a wonderful picture essay Mike. Thank you so much for the work involved in putting it together. Reports don't generally convey all the great time a person has had but I'll tell you Mike.... this is as close as they come to being perfect. Thanks again, and for what it's worth you may not think you could ever top that trip but I know you will."

255015,solopaddler,2008-10-03 13:26:00,8605," John, I'd be happy to help you out with all the details if you decide to make the trip (and that goes for anyone else as well). There were certain things we didn't get to do on this trip, chiefly fish for steelhead on a couple of the smaller rivers further down the Kenai peninsula. That was a direct result of too much rain and the rivers being blown out.  Ah well, on the bright side it does give me an excellent reason to go back  .  Once again thanks everyone,  Cheers"
