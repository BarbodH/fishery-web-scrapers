258832,BillM,2008-10-16 02:36:00,17367,"For shore fishing, you'll need some decent braid, a few jigs and some live shrimp  Depending on where you are going, you should have no problems catching whitings, ladyfish, spanish mackerel, pomps and even some sea trout."

258847,ctdd2006,2008-10-16 03:17:00,531,took a trip to the everglades once....bought a cheap spinning combo at the local walmart and some big plastics texas rigged and flipped them into some cabbage and waterways of some back roads and had a blast!  Gave the rod to the first kid that looked like he would appreciate it after I was done and brought home the memories on the plane!  We don't get buckets like that here!  Give it a try!  Don't be shy to ask the yokals for directions!  Congrats on the wedding and enjoy the cruise!  All the best.....CHEERS!

258895,bigugli,2008-10-16 11:49:00,6138,"Big white double willow spinnerbaits for the bass and some 8-10"" worms. Both work great on the Kissemee area bass, but nothing beats live shads."
