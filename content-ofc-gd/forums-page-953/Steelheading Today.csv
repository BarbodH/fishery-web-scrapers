On this day the scenery stole the show with the fall colours ablaze in our glorious October sunlight. Today a friend and I walked a solid 12km (6 up, 6 back) through this amazing backdrop in search of fish. An exhausting yet satisfying trek.          With the warm temp's most fish were nosed up into the fast water at the heads of the pools. Innocuous little fast water seams and slots all held fish, (albeit almost entirely small skippers).    We each caught a bunch of these feisty little guys, with micro bags tied in white, singles and light fluoro leaders being the order of day.    My bud landed one decent adult fish in the 7lb range. I had another that shot upstream like a missile, jumped 3 feet out of the river cartwheeling and spit my hook. Definitely one I'll remember...  The only downside...near the end of the day the tip broke on my brand new custom Raven float rod. I need a new tip and need to get it re-wrapped fast. Checked the Raven website hoping to call them direct and expedite the process, but there's no contact number. If anyone out there does happen to have a phone number could you pass it along to me? I'd greatly appreciate it!  Have a good one boys,  Cheers,  Mike"

257703,kemper,2008-10-12 05:01:00,2232,"Same thing for me today Solo, alot of walking for two small steelies. Did manage to land a VERY pretty resident bow about 16"" though.  Good fishin  kemper"
257716,b2kptbo,2008-10-12 11:25:00,1505," A good show and dance is almost as good as landing them, sometimes. It's nice this time of year but with all the walking it can be more like hunting...."
258302,Paulus,2008-10-14 19:10:00,522," Mike, I did some searching for you and all I can tell for sure is that they’re associated with Anglers International (www.anglersinternational.com). Can’t find them in the yellow pages, either, though. This same thing happened to another friend of mine, with his IM6, and it took him a long time to get the part back. 2 months at least. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news .  I'll edit this post if I find anything else. p.-"
258808,Pigeontroller,2008-10-16 01:49:00,2793,"Great pics Mike! Been awhile since I've been there! I gotta admit, its nice to see you don't always ""crush em""."
258813,solopaddler,2008-10-16 01:56:00,8605," More than one person has said that LOL! It's a game of timing. I knew going in it would be tough sledding, still a great day though."
258826,ehg,2008-10-16 02:20:00,2666,"Nice scenery for a walk, a few fish is a bonus. Good stuff, ehg"
