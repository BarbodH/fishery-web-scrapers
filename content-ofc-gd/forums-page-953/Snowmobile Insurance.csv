258569,boatman,2008-10-15 13:59:00,350,I need to insure a couple snowmobiles in Ancaster (Hamilton). Anyone here have a policy in Hamilton? I won't hear back from my broker for two weeks and I'm curious what rates are like and if I can get a better deal.  1973 Ski Doo Olympic 440cc 1993 Polaris Indy Trail Deluxe 440cc
