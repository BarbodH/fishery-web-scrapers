Fished from just before 11 till about 6:30 and caught one musky, 35"".  First time we've been on the river so we can't complain.  The launch wasn't very co-operative though, we ended up getting stuck on the way out and had to call CAA.... Oh well, still a gorgeous day to be out on the water.  Fish hit in 13 fow on a perch bait trolled about 10 feet down.  Water was about 56 degrees.  "
