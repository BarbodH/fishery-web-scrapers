254273,BillM,2008-10-01 12:37:00,17367,Our very own MuskyMike and his GBay monster!  Way to go man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
254308,ehg,2008-10-01 14:10:00,2666,Haven't seen the issue but i remember the fish! Will take a browse when by a newstand. I figured that was why it was pulled from this site. Money talks. Was it mentioned that OFNer's helped put him on the spot and many other tips?
254339,BillM,2008-10-01 16:28:00,17367,"OFC was not mentioned, but Mike worked his a$$ off for that fish, he definitely deserved it."
254474,Kerry,2008-10-01 23:45:00,383,Wish I could but Walmart stopped carrying Muskyhunter here in Orillia for some reason. Kerry

254480,misfish,2008-10-02 00:06:00,29133, Does that include the fuel you burned?  That would add on a few more years.LOL Congrats none the less.
258287,ehg,2008-10-14 18:18:00,2666,"Finally saw MuskyMike's fish in the magazine, was dissapointed by it however. Only a thumbnail size picture and a few sentences. It was WAY better when posted on this site, great story before it was yanked.  However found this paper with familiar face.   There was 5 full pages written inside on this trip... only'part one'"
