Wondering if anyone in the Ottawa area is interested in this unique back yard BBQ and table. Think of it as a huge fondue pot. Cook and eat at the same time. There is a finer cooking grate that goes over the three bars (that's not shown in the pic). Wooden plates that are shown... not sure about them but probably all negotiable. They just wanna get some of their costs back out.  Send me a PM asap so I can put you in touch with our daughter (I'm not posting her email or phone # here!)... I'm leaving in the morning, for a week or more, so hope someone has interest tonight.  Thanks!!"
258788,irishfield,2008-10-16 01:30:00,26272,It's a bump if nothing else Paul. They have around 2 grand into this project between the 6 of them. That $350 each could buy a mess of beer! LOL
258801,irishfield,2008-10-16 01:44:00,26272,"I was going to bring it home on Saturday for the cottage... and then their professors told them they couldn't take things down because the Governor General was coming by to check them all out on Wednesday or Thursday...so we couldn't take it and Leah still couldn't take it this morning when she left Ottawa.  It is unique. Each of the wood plates has an indent to sit in. The three pieces are bolted down to a built up 4x4 pressure treated stand.  Hopefully they find someone to take it off their hands... otherwise I have a feeling it might become a ""stepping stone"" thru the bullrushes to ease access to the river for fishing! LOL"

258921,wuchikubo,2008-10-16 13:15:00,1114,Looks like an interesting piece Wayne. Mind you it looks very heavy. Be careful and don't put your back out bud.
258923,Wild,2008-10-16 13:35:00,704,Have the group Auction it along with a catered back yard BBQ! Sell tickets at 5$ each and you have the potential for making plenty.
