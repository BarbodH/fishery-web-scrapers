257763,limeyangler,2008-10-12 15:27:00,5204,"Hey Firecat,  try this....it calculates best fishing and hunting times for the specific date you enter, it also connects to google earth so you can pinpoint the location you are calculating for.....i dont think it has a chart per se of lunar phases...but when you do a calculation it gives you the moon phase for the date you are calculating. click on the link below....hope this helps  fishbyte"

258170,JFR,2008-10-14 12:18:00,498,"http://www.solunarforecast.com/solunarcalendar.aspx  Try this web site,  I have been fooling around with this site, putting in my home postal code, then a postal code for the area I will be fishing on Wednesday, works very well, gives you moon and sun rises and moon and sun sets.  Major feeding and Minor feeding, plus phase of moon.  The difference between the two postal codes was 3 minutes for each phase. Pretty impressive and the site is FREE!!   just JOHN"
258186,Roy,2008-10-14 13:18:00,13728,Thanks for the link JR. I hadn't seen that one. It looks good.
258276,johnnyb,2008-10-14 17:52:00,3413,"Yeah, JR -- that is a new one to me as well, and now my favourite -- it's nice to have the exact location pinned down    But here's a question:  Do these times account for daylight savings time, or not?"
258900,JFR,2008-10-16 12:13:00,498," Roy, do you think it is possible, for the benefit of all OFC members could it be arrange to have a permanent link to this site established here?"
259005,JFR,2008-10-16 17:53:00,498," johnnyb, I just received a reply to my e=mail to the webmaster: here it is:  Greetings John,  Thanks for the kind words.  Yes, the tables do take into account Daylight Savings times if the selected area observes it and my data is correct.
