258570,BillM,2008-10-15 14:02:00,17367,So many answers to this question   We need to know what goals the OP has before we start to offer advice.
258573,mepps,2008-10-15 14:11:00,1301,great advice so far and go easy with ankle weights or you might injure your knees.
258597,Greencoachdog,2008-10-15 15:59:00,8163,I would say that fat and sugar are 2 of the tastiest substances in the universe!... and some folks get downright testy when you suggest they should deprive themselves of some of it (eh Raf?)  ... but we can really live with less than we take in as a whole population on this planet.
258601,1Harringtona,2008-10-15 16:07:00,77, My goal was to be able to dunk the basketball. before I started to work out I could just barley touch the rim and now after about 3 weeks of working out I have gained about 1 inch of vertical so now I am able to grab the rim with the tip of my fingers and pull it down. I am very happy about this but I was wondering if there was any exercises with ankle weights as I am now wearing them to school. Also thanks for the great advise  as I am also trying to lose weight. So if anyone else has some ideas please add on to what is already here.
258608,Raf,2008-10-15 16:25:00,3495,squats and power cleans (have your football coach teach them to you) both will aid in your ability to dunk.  squats for core & lower body strength.. power cleans for that explosive core power.  if you wanna lose weight eat less than what your body burns.
258610,1Harringtona,2008-10-15 16:32:00,77,What are power cleans ( I don't have a Football coach because I dont play Football I play Basketball) if it is to hard to explain post a web site that explains it. Thanks
258615,Raf,2008-10-15 16:37:00,3495,http://media.crossfit.com/cf-video/CrossFi...erCleanJump.mov  http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ#The_Powerclean  have a look at the entire site for some excellent information   your basketball coach should know how to properly do them as well.  your school has a football program does it not?
258621,1Harringtona,2008-10-15 16:53:00,77,No I don't think my school (Mohawk College) has a football program
258623,Bitsmith2k,2008-10-15 16:55:00,396, cleans & deadlifts are prolly the 2 best lifts goin.. just make sure you get someone to show you and watch you in person.. two very easy lifts to seriously hurt yourself on..
258630,BillM,2008-10-15 17:03:00,17367,  It didn't when I was there and still doesn't
258634,Raf,2008-10-15 17:28:00,3495,"bitsmith makes a great point, have someone in the know teach you.  also, never sacrifice proper form to move more weight - no matter how tempting it is.   you'll likely be learning the clean with an empty bar.. dont be discouraged.  you've the benefit of having a weight room (i am assuming mohawk has one of those), use it!"
258637,misfish,2008-10-15 17:44:00,29133,"Well being 44,I got back into the wieght thing/working out. My goal was to get to 180,Im now at 175,thats a lose of 59 pounds. Time to stop the losing part,as I havent been that since I was 18 yoa. The wieghts have built back the form I was looking for and the squats and sit ups,have tight,n up the calve and stomach just fine. My routine consits of 1/2 hr on the tread mill or cross trainer and pushing/pulling and curling wieghts that make you want to give up after the 4th or 5th rep for 1.5/2 hours. That was 5 days a week,but now have cut down to mon/wed/friday,with the odd sunday if the weather is crap. Once you been doing it,it gets easier and I got to say,alot of fun.  As for my food intake. Fish/chicken and the odd stirfry,ok more often.LOL. Porage and cream of wheat with some fruit in the morning. Good luck and dont push to hard til you are comfortable with the wieght your working with.A partner in your work out is a good thing as you can both push each other."
258674,DANIMAL,2008-10-15 20:44:00,215,"The best diet for losing fat is not to eat less, for that slows your metabolism, and does not allow your body to get enough nutrients especially if you are weight training. The best way is to raise your metabolism by eating often, a meal every 3 hours your awake is best. The size of the meal depends on your size, muscle mass, and how active of a life style you have. each meal should consist of both lean protien and whole grain carbohydrates or vegetables. You'll have to experiment with portion size to see what is right for you, or make an appointment with a good personal trainer/nutritionalist. You dont have to follow this or any diet exactly, but like anything, you will only get out of it what you put in to it."
258708,GbayGiant,2008-10-15 22:01:00,1780,"I use to be a hard core body builder and know a little and also played basketball for years and could dunk pretty good at only 6 feet (blew out my knees a few yeras ago).  Whats your goal ? to loose fat or gain muscle ? because you can't do both at the same time like people think, all though if you loose fat and tone up it gives the appearance that you gained muscle.  To gain muscle you have to eat extra calories than normal with tones of protein and lift heavy weights where you can only do 4-5 reps tops, to loose fat you simply do cardio and eat less/better, fast paced workout, play a sport or whatever, if your sweating hard that's a good sign .  Best foods for protein :  Egg whites Salmon/most fish Skim milk Skinless baked chicken Almonds Natural almond butter instead of peanut   Stick to those healthy foods with lots of green veggies and only drink water, you'll see results. It comes down to motivation and dedication and a whole new eating habit for life, not just a little diet here and there.  If your goal is basketball training, loosing wight and cardio is going to help a million times more than adding any muscle but at the same time playing basketball in itself is some of the best exercise and cardio you could ever get, so I say just play more, jump more, run more and it will come. As far as dunking a ball most people just can't, height is the biggest factor really, you can get those jump shoes and training program comes with them, we use to use them at camp not sure how much they helped. Stretching before playing is important, and to dunk you'll need to get at least 5 inches over the rim but it comes down to athleticism and practice so time on the court will be the best help working out will be second but I would just play more, it will come."
258744,azanier,2008-10-15 23:29:00,23,Here's a useful website:  http://www.coopersguns.com/videos/exercise-encyclopedia/  It will show you various basic exercises and which muscles are involved. Each exercise has a video along with it to show you how to do it properly.  Plus always stretch everyday (even when you don't work out) to keep loose and to avoid serious injury.  Good luck!
258758,1Harringtona,2008-10-16 00:15:00,77,"My hight helps me dunk as I am 6'2"" but my weight is literally holding me down as I'm 255 lbs. I would love to be able to get another 4 inches on my vert. so I can dunk the ball and not just touch the rim."
258836,glirw,2008-10-16 02:52:00,200,"Don't forget that if you want to see results from proper nutrition and weight lifting, you better be in this for the long run because the body doesn't build muscle quickly.  Focus on putting more weight on the bar for the first 6 months . Start from an empty bar to get your body used to abuse.  Good luck."
258855,GbayGiant,2008-10-16 03:39:00,1780," Well 6'2"" is still short for dunking standards at that height you would still need above average vertical to dunk regulation, but yeah at 255 lbs that's real tough for a big guy, just hit the gym hard do more Z's, play more basketball, run harder and a healthy diet is most important. I think 200lbs would be a perfect basketball weight for you at 6'2"" and you'll feel a lot lighter and have less stress on your knees ect, so I wouldn't worry about trying to put on muscle at this point untill you feel really light and than you can add lean muscle later on if you want. If your playing basketball for a couple hours every day and change your diet healthier that alone should be enough to drop the pounds fairly quick, if you do workout do light weights high reps and back to back sets like circuit training, if you have a super slow metabolism than all you can do is work even harder,  sweat untill you puke and eventually you won't puke anymore. If you drop some decent pounds I think your vertical will improve and your joints should feel better and you'll have a good shot. So more cardio, healthier diet, play as much as you can, constantly jump at the rim over and over every day and you'll get there."
258460,Greencoachdog,2008-10-15 01:36:00,8163," Yes... exactly!  They key to losing weight and being healthy is a healthy diet and exercise!... the first thing you do is go into the fridge and throw out the butter tub, cheese, mayo jar, ice cream, and whole milk... replace the whole milk with skim milk, then go to the pantry and throw out the peanut butter jar and the cookies... all of these ""so called"" foods are very high in fat!  Your body has to do very little to fat in the digestion process and it goes straight to being body fat! There's an enzyme in body fat called Leptin, when you burn body fat your Leptin level drops sending a signal to your brain that you are hungry even though you may not need to eat... it is a built self preservation device and is the main reason overweight/obese people feel like they need to eat even though they don't!!!  A low fat diet rich in raw fruit, vegetables, and very lean meat (mainly skinless baked poultry) and low fat soups will make a healthier fitter you!"
258463,1Harringtona,2008-10-15 01:43:00,77,"throwing out the peanut butter is a great idea unless you buy the real stuff that you need to mix because after working out you need protein, thats when you have either a spoon full or one piece of bread with peanut butter. (thats what I do anyways)"
258504,Joey,2008-10-15 03:36:00,9122," I know what you're saying Glen, but what I meant was Portion Control!  You can have small amounts of anything, as long as you don't eat a large portion of it.  We need fat in our diets, just not a tablespoon and a half for a sandwich.  Two ""teaspoons,"" not ""tablespoons"" of butter is more than enough for a sandwich and you don't need to slather on the mayo either.  As for McDonalds, you couldn't pay me to eat there!!  Joey"
258521,OhioFisherman,2008-10-15 05:39:00,6623,"It`s been a while for me and a work out. I used to wear up to 7.5 pounds of ankle weights on each leg while at work, truck driver with lots of stops during the day for pickups and deliveries so I did quite a bit of walking. Wrist weights got in the way while driving so I didn`t use them while driving.  Raf is right about using the large muscle masses, they burn the most calories. When I was into it lunch was 2 or 3 cans of Tuna and some cut up fruit, a can of Salmon sometimes instead of the tuna.  Dinner was whatever I wanted, Steak, Chicken, with side dishes, then a work out with free weight, the bench, 150 situps, squats, jumping jacks, till it got dark enough for some night fishing.  Can`t lose weight or build muscle on the couch watching TV. I was single at the time with not a lot of distractions.  Don`t try to be a hero, start easy, warm up, if you go heavy on the bench have a spotter. Just a mind set to it, after a while it becomes fun."
258524,holdfast,2008-10-15 05:57:00,1813," I agree 90 percent what he says because rest assure someone from that same school or others will tell us its bad for us.  Whats the difference between Aerobics and Calastetics. One is bad for you and one has music and is the IN THING.  My Job was being fit and I always prided myself for being the fittest for my age 25 yrs plus.  My experience is after seeing a Dietitian after spending 6 months in IRAQ eating hard Rations.  Was cut down on Sugars, Cheese, and don't miss meals.  Circuit Training in the Gym and the odd day circuit training in the weight room.  My weight went down fast till it plateaued.  Then I switched to another exercise which was step-ups 3 times a week at noon.  I just turned 50 and I still work out everyday as I feel like a slug if I don't.  3 Days a week I circuit train  Push ups, Sit Ups , Bur-pees, Barbell Curls, Barbell presses, while running as hard as my age will let me 3 times around the Gym between exercises. The other  two days is a heavy Rucksack walk. Only one problem, I'm only maintaining as I should also Diet and not drink alcoholic fluids on the weekends."
258540,Raf,2008-10-15 11:18:00,3495," you are misinformedo n a few points glen.  what youre telling me is if i cut fat down to 60 grams but still consume a caloric excess thanks to carbs and protein i will lose weight which is simply not true.  the only time anything you consume gets stored as fat (and that can be carbs or protein too) is when you consume more cals than what you use in a day.  let me say it again.  calories, no matter what form they come in (fat, carbs or proteins), are one thing only: energy.  if you consume less calories in a day than what you use there is no excess to be stored as fat or to be used in an anabolic process such as growing muscle.   so.. you eat less than what your body requires.. your body will use energy stores in your body (ie. fat, muscle) to make up the energy shortfall from the caloric deficit.  the problem with many diets is that they cut waaaaay too many calories, when this happens your body goes into a catabolic state.  basically it's just trying to survive and it will use existing muscle mass as an energy source BEFORE using fat.  so you get a double whammy.. slower metabolism, less muscle mass.  when you start eating 'normally' again, you will put back on the weight and more quickly!"
258552,Raf,2008-10-15 12:42:00,3495,"as for what to eat.  protein is key, lean red meat, chicken, turkey, fish, egg whites, all good sources.  it can be tough to consume enough protein in a day, this is where protein shakes can come in handy - be careful to avoid the ones loaded with sugars (carbs).  the good ones will have 1 gram of carbs or less per serving.  cut out white carbs (white bread, white rice, sugars) these are junk carbs.  focus on whole wheat breads, brown rice.  greens are another good source of carbs (spinach, beans, broccolli).  be careful with fruits as many contain lots of sugar.  fruit juice as a health drink is a bit of a misnomer.  fructose is not as bad as sucrose but don't over do it.   personally i avoid fruit juices with teh exception of grapefruit juice.  not all fat is created equal.  there are 'good' fats.  fish oil is a great example.  milk, cottage cheese yet another great source of 'good' fat and protein.  nothing wrong with the occasional stop at rotten ronnies.  toss out the bun and go to town.  the jr. chicken sandwiches are a good deal, 4 per meal outta do it.  i've basically gone from about 22-23% body fat to mid teens eating smarter and working out as I described earlier.  My weight hasn't changed all that much, in fact I probably weigh a little more (remember, muscle is heavier than fat).  however, the mirror doesn't lie much less body fat and I feel and am much stronger."
258563,DANIMAL,2008-10-15 13:16:00,215,"  I've never used ankle weights or any of that sort of stuff before, just freeweights. But for any type of working out it takes longer than a week to see big results. If you are seeing okay results in a week, I'd say your doing a good job. Stick at it, and you will see better results.  And what kind of results are you after."
