256462,jwl,2008-10-08 15:53:00,1056, No worries on that for me..mine is insured 12 months a year
256464,jwl,2008-10-08 15:56:00,1056," I can come up with a couple ideas for dinner no problem ,I know what you mean about the Light House Restaraunt there, haven't been since it changed hands, I will come up with a couple suggestions where they would have ample parking for anyone with boats in tow as well"
256475,Squid,2008-10-08 16:19:00,1656,"I was there last weekend Lew and that restaurant is for sale again. I guess 10 bucks for a burger and potato chips was not the right price""?"
256529,jwl,2008-10-08 19:00:00,1056,"I have one seat reserved as of this afternoon...so I am still willing to take on one more person if needed no problems  , I even have a spare heavy rod if needed as well"
256543,Handlebarz,2008-10-08 19:29:00,3790,Well if thigs are frozen over here I will have to make the trip and take Pete up on the offer of the couch for the night that is mighty nice of you to offer thanks Pete.
256645,walleyemen,2008-10-08 22:55:00,316,"JAck i'll take you up on your offer if you still have a seat available, my baby will be sleeping by then LOL."
256916,Squid,2008-10-09 16:50:00,1656,you are most welcome Mike.
256920,jwl,2008-10-09 16:56:00,1056," sure, alright boat is full then..it's better to fish with 3 than 4 in my boat anyways,specially when we load it up with big rods and baits."
256968,charlied,2008-10-09 19:30:00,584,right in my back yard....I could be up to this if someone has room in there boat at that time.
256975,wuchikubo,2008-10-09 20:01:00,1114,"Lew, is this only for experienced 'ski anglers? Or will a muskie newbie like myself be allowed to join the ranks of masters like yourself?  It's good that you have this post nice and up early, I can plan for it.  If there are any more spots on boats, I'd be interested (so long as the muskie group initiation doesn't require me to swim for it, LOL).  Stan"
257031,lew,2008-10-09 23:07:00,12767," Absolutely NOT Stan, it's an open invitation to any OFNer who wants to come out and have a good day on the water and then a nice supper somewhere at the end of the day to compare notes.  We've been doing this for a few years now and it's always a great day and a nice way to close out the season.  Our boat is already full Stan, but hopefully you can hitch a ride with someone, it'd be good to finally meet you after all this time."
257032,irishfield,2008-10-09 23:09:00,26272,We'll see Lew... we'll see. Depending on weather and whether the Midland ramp is frozen yet?
257046,lew,2008-10-09 23:37:00,12767,Hope you can make it this year Wayne
257152,snag,2008-10-10 04:02:00,1932,Love to fish with Lew.  But I might be on a beach with my toes in the sand.  (or doing home renovations to the sounds of a screaming wife and baby!)  
257286,Uncle Buck,2008-10-10 15:22:00,1000,"I'm interested, but it's all gonna depend on work and if someone will have me on board..."
257327,wuchikubo,2008-10-10 17:16:00,1114,I'm interested in going as well and will be there if there is someone who will put up with a muskie newbie like me in their boat.
257340,Greencoachdog,2008-10-10 17:49:00,8163,"I'd interject with my usual ""Could somebody swing by and pick me up?""  ... but I'm afraid someone might actually do it!"
257387,PERCHER,2008-10-10 19:50:00,787,Glen if you come up I will save a seat in my boat for you.Heck I wil even put you up for the weekend.Or was that put up with you for the weekend.
258640,wuchikubo,2008-10-15 18:02:00,1114,Anyone have a spot in a boat left?
256128,lew,2008-10-07 11:47:00,12767,"It's still a longs ways off, but myself & Squid always finish off the musky season with a trip to the Upper Niagara the last Saturday of the season, which this year will be December 13th.  We always post it here beforehand and get a few OFNers to join us, usually anywhere from 3-6 boats, and we always have an excellent day and finish it of with supper somewhere on the way home.  Like I say, it's still a couple months away yet, but I'm just giving everyone a heads up and if your boats still in the water & you think you'd like to join us you can mark it on your calander as a reminder.  It's always a great day and we'll post it again as the time gets closer.  Just don't forget your  ice chopper for the boat ramp"
256134,Roy,2008-10-07 12:08:00,13728,Sounds like a super time Lew....really wish I could make that one but things are up in the air here. Wishing you all a good turn out and a great day on the water.
256138,Rizzo,2008-10-07 12:49:00,4754,brrrrrr I'm cold just thinking about it. I should be there and I bet someone will catch a fish this year too!
256139,Fishmaster,2008-10-07 12:50:00,920,Hope to be there this year also ..
256147,lew,2008-10-07 13:25:00,12767,"I knew you'd be in for sure Roger, your the one  diehard we can always count on, and Steve, it'd be great to have you finally join us too.  Roy, you know your ALWAYS welcome bud."
256150,Joey,2008-10-07 13:53:00,9122,"We'll probably give it a shot again this year too Lew.  As I recall, the last time we did go, didn't he temp rise to about 10+ degrees.  It was a lovely day out there on the water in December  And I think Rizzo is right, a fish will be caught this year  Joey"
256155,lew,2008-10-07 14:07:00,12767,"I remember that day Joey, 2 years ago I think ??  We've also seen it so cold that the harbour at the marina is frozen solid and we have to launch over at Frenchmans Creek cause thats the only place where the river current is strong enough to prevent the ice from forming.  As rizzo says......brrrrr I'm cold just thinking about it hahaha"
256156,bucktail,2008-10-07 14:20:00,1857,If you guys will have me I would love to come!   darren
256158,BITEME,2008-10-07 14:22:00,1969,Yeah I think I might give this a go this year and see if we can boat a shark will you be posting maps to the launches as the day draws near.  Im having way to much fun at the moment boating big pike  Just a side note on the above statment all big pike the last 4 weeks have been on JUMLAs and nothing else not from lack of trying either  Peter
256179,Squid,2008-10-07 15:40:00,1656,I am in.
256246,kickingfrog,2008-10-07 20:14:00,8333,"Let know if anybody needs some ballast. I'll have any extra piece of pumpkin pie this weekend, just to make sure I make weight."
256252,jwl,2008-10-07 20:41:00,1056,"I should be able to join in as well with my boat,I don't put the boat ""away"" for the winter  ... I can see the Upper from my driveway as I live like 2 blocks away from the Upper Niagara and only a couple minutes drive of the boat ramps, I can keep tabs on the conditions for everyone no probs..the ramp at the marina will most likely be closed however as this is the first year opened up not ""Park's Commission"" operated it is private now and in the ""off season"" since last winter it was gated and locked....there are other options depending on where everyone wants to fish though for free ramps."
256253,tinbanger,2008-10-07 20:49:00,1028,If roads aren't a mess ( Towing with FWD van WITH snow tires) and someone promises to pull me out of the launch count me in .  TB
256256,Rizzo,2008-10-07 20:57:00,4754,"this is sounding good! I will likely have some room in my boat for 1 fellow OFC'er, plus i will probably fish the upper 2 or 3 times in November so by december I'll know all the spots where there are no fish"
256274,jwl,2008-10-07 22:32:00,1056,"  I know muskies would be the choice quarry for the day..but depending on weather, and where launching from, there is always a chance of ending the day at a crack at some Upper River rainbows or something too  Like I said, I will keep tabs on conditions, and can even show up a bit early to help clear the ramp, as they are pretty much all within 10-15 minutes or less from my house"
256277,lew,2008-10-07 22:44:00,12767," Thanks for that info jwl, it's never been  closed in December before but if it is this year, it's not a problem, we'll just head down the road to Frenchmans Creek. It's not as good a ramp but we've used it before when it was snow covered with no problems.  Just have to be sure everyone brings some sand and a shovel for the ramp if needed."
256278,jwl,2008-10-07 22:49:00,1056,"Don't worry Lew,like I said, I can easily keep tabs on conditions at all the ramps, they are minutes from my house, I always keep some sand/salt/shovel handy when I do alot of winter fishing so I can also easily show up a bit before everyone else and start working on it"
256298,Streamerguy,2008-10-08 00:00:00,121,"Don't have a boat    but i do have a rod  I'll be keeping my eye on this, very close to home for me  cheers Streamerguy"
256300,Raf,2008-10-08 00:03:00,3495,"i'll also keep an eye.. maybe jp would be interested as well.  boat will be wrapped up by then, so we'd have to bum a ride.  have a 4x4 in case the ramp is iffy."
256403,JFR,2008-10-08 12:14:00,498," Dave, I'd be interested in sharing the boat with you.  I can tow your boat with my pick up.  John"
256407,e-z-out,2008-10-08 12:27:00,1052,Rizzo if that seat is still up for grabs count me in. 
256447,PERCHER,2008-10-08 15:00:00,787,Count me in on this one. Dan
256456,jwl,2008-10-08 15:37:00,1056,I am pretty sure I will have room for at least 1 in my boat too..can squeeze 2 if needed if I already have a second tagging along with me  the 4th guy doesn't get a comfy seat  .  will hook up 2 riggers as well for the day
256458,Gerry,2008-10-08 15:40:00,257,"Just  a word of caution for those of us who have more than 100HP motors. Insurance policies require that the boat be stored from Dec 1st. So, if you use your boat after that date you have no coverage."
256460,lew,2008-10-08 15:47:00,12767,"Looks like were gonna have an excellent turnout this year guys, guaranteed you'll all enjoy the day.  jwl, we always used to have dinner at the little restaurant at Netherby & Niagara Pkwy but they changed hands  last year and it's not so good anymore, so perhaps you know of another local  restaurant that could put our crew up for supper ??"
