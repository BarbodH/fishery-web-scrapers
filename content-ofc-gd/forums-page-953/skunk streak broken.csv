258254,Leecher,2008-10-14 17:11:00,7832,Nice looking lakers you guys caught Thanks for sharing Leechman
258259,ccmtcanada,2008-10-14 17:15:00,7971,Great job on those lakers!  I've yet to catch one of those....from both boat and shore!  Nice to get those skunks to go away isn't it?
258267,MARK69,2008-10-14 17:32:00,24,"Hey, nice lakers you got there...All nighter I presume looking at Jerry's eyes...  Forbsie"
258272,Pachone,2008-10-14 17:42:00,276,Nice report and some beaut Lakers!
258376,Greencoachdog,2008-10-14 22:44:00,8163,Real nice shore Lakers!!!  The water has got to be cooling down pretty well for them to come in close and shallow like that!
258396,fishindevil,2008-10-14 23:43:00,6254,Afew nice fall lakers for sure !!!!...nice pics too.  .glad you got the monkey off your back...cheers
258427,timmeh,2008-10-15 00:50:00,609,"Nice lakers, never caught one of those in the tribs yet. Too bad no steelies yet but it's always nice to get a surprise catch like that.  Surprised to see that few people at Port Albert, though I suspect the beach was full. Once things pick up it's hard to find a spot to stand in that section. But if you've been there before you likely already know that."
258870,Stern Rules,2008-10-16 05:28:00,342,"Was that a cormorant and if so, did you ring it's neck?"
259050,MARK69,2008-10-16 19:37:00,24,"I hope that's not a cormorant unless it's on ROIDS ....Cuz if it is, LOOK  OUT.......Thats a big bugger .....I think it's a heron, or at least hope so....  Freek"
259051,sharper,2008-10-16 19:40:00,279,"Those are some great looking lakers from shore, good job!"
259054,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-10-16 19:43:00,1362,Definately is a Heron...congrats on breakin the curse and gettin some trout!!
259149,splashhopper,2008-10-17 01:29:00,2931,"Nice pics.. i am glad that heron didn't grab my line while I was fishing ""NEXT TO YOU"" in Kincardine ! lol  Did my ""OPP"" friend show up after I left?  Splashhopper"
