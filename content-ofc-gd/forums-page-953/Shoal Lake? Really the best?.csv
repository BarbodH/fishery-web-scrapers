I have heard a lot of good comment about Shoal Lake. Is it really the #1 fishing lake for bass and pike in Ontario? Im also looking at the quality of the guides and food for the week. The price doesn't really mather, all I want is an unforgetable moment If anyone has any comment about other really nice lake please let me know. Also if some of you been on a trip in Shoal lake I would like to know how how it was.  Thank you very much, really appreciate your comments."

Currently the webiste site is gawd aweful. But it is getting revamped as we speak. Prices on it are correct.  As far as lodges go price is the #1 limiting factor. It all depends on what you're looking for in a trip, accomidations and how long you are willing to stay. From what i have seen, i'd say 5 days to a week is your best bet for length. I have seen a lot of guest get shafted with 3 day trips due to bad weather in the north part of the province.  If you wanna chat more about it let me know.  I'm sure some of the other guys here will pipe in shortly.  -R-"
