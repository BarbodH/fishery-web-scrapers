341306,Victor,2009-05-14 03:28:00,1609,"Marko gave me a call in the morning and asked if I wanted to go for some trout fishing, I only have 2 hours of class on Weds in the morning, so my answer was ...""Hell yeah!""  Got to the spot at around 5pm and fished till 8ish, we both got around 15-20 browns. They were all small (the biggest was probably no bigger than 12 inches) but it was fun regardless. The bite was on throughout most of the evening, and we even found a hole that was stacked with fish, you could just see them come up and try to get the bait/lure when we cast in there.  Here's one of the bigger ones   I love this shot, wallpaper material and gonna be one of my personal favourites.   I'm still not going to say that carp is ugly but these fish definitely are gorgeous.  Thanks for driving Marko!"

341312,Victor,2009-05-14 03:48:00,1609,"yeah unfortunately I deep-hooked one and had to keep him along with 2 others for a fish fry, it's in ma belly now and it was awesome.  started off the day with bottom bouncing trout worms, when we ran out a size 0 or 1 spinner worked just as good."
341353,Trevor0179,2009-05-14 12:21:00,65,nice fish Vic I wish I could have been there with ya but theres always next time
341356,Marko,2009-05-14 12:30:00,854,Pretty fish indeed. Have you noticed every time we leave Trevor behind we catch fish ahaha. Too bad those kayakers showed up and decided to invade my fishing pool
341378,kennyman,2009-05-14 13:37:00,737,Those really are pretty little jewels aren't they? Sounds like fun guys.
341446,KelfuN,2009-05-14 16:44:00,246,"great looking browns!!lots of those guys around in the spring,hahaha...  heres a tip, when you know you'll be catching a school of small fish like these..just pinch the barbs on the hooks, it'll be way easier to unhook them and does no damage to them."
341716,MJL,2009-05-15 04:05:00,2427,Great report Vic...One of these days I'll try giving those browns/brookies a try.  And you thought that you weren't going to be doing much fishing this summer...
