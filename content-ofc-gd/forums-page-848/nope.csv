336162,jharcnc,2009-04-29 01:24:00,14,Simply INCREDIBLE!!!  Congrats!!!
336165,ctdd2006,2009-04-29 01:31:00,531,Thumbs up to you boys!  Cheers!
336277,Raf,2009-04-29 11:49:00,3495," we don't fish trout other than right at ice out or the odd time when a meal is appropriate.   so the roe is of no use to us.   when filleting, you can either cut around the rib cage or go through it then cut out the bones.  they'll come off in one piece.  a sharp knife is key.   Not this time.  JP treated us to a spicy maple syrup concoction on the BBQ that I am still drooling over.  it was dynomite!"
336466,Leecher,2009-04-29 23:28:00,7832,Outstanding guys   :worthy: I still can't believe how dark those enormous lakers are  Thanks for sharing Leechman
340295,Raf,2009-05-11 15:17:00,3495,leechman: it's a particular strain of trout.  we do get 'em in silver bullet form as well - this year the big guys/gals were darker specimens.
342049,snag,2009-05-16 04:09:00,1932,Respect!
342059,trapshooter,2009-05-16 11:24:00,1234,Raf - I must have been turkey hunting when this hit the board.  Thanks for another great weekend of 'ice out trout'.  It's always a hoot hanging out with you guys for a few days.  Good luck with the pike - hopefully your weather is better then ours.
335730,Raf,2009-04-28 03:18:00,3495,aa
335731,splashhopper,2009-04-28 03:20:00,2931,Holy crap !  nice fish
335736,smokin joe,2009-04-28 03:26:00,226,Those are some beauties for sure. Thanks for posting Raf  Did you manage to catch that roe from the one in the fourth pic?
335739,drwxr,2009-04-28 03:29:00,453,your report is missing laker gps   .  good job on those monsters. btw is that splake with different pattern?
335740,limeyangler,2009-04-28 03:30:00,5204,AWESOME....   Great stuff Raf....jealousy does not even come close to the emotion i feel right now....lol   They seek him here...they seek him there....that freekin' Benbeattie dude is every bloody where!
335746,Joeytier,2009-04-28 03:38:00,3990,Those trout are ridiculous!
335751,jrego7,2009-04-28 03:59:00,37,Nice! Some massive fish there! Question how did you remove the row of bones above the rib cage? Pull them out one by one?
335777,Cookslav,2009-04-28 05:00:00,1457,"I love how you let the Pictures do the talking Raf Those fish are fantastic G-bay specimens! (I'm assuming their G-bay fish???) Cheers,"
335785,Musky or Specks,2009-04-28 05:43:00,2710,And if they were GB fish any lamprey scaring? Those LT are beast.
335793,solopaddler,2009-04-28 08:56:00,8605,"Was wondering how Ben had made out with you guys. Obviously pretty good. Outstanding fish all around boys, well done.  What's interesting to me, the general area where I'm pretty sure you were fishing contains a lot of pen reared escapee rainbows. The fish in your pic's sure look like pen reared fish. If that's the case then G-bAY has a big problem. They were engineered to be fall spawners and that  hen was dripping roe. It's only a matter of time 'till they interbreed with our wild fish....  Glad to see you're bonking as many as you can."
335800,b2kptbo,2009-04-28 10:40:00,1505,"Some goodin's 4sure, well done..."
