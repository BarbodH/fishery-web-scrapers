I am assuming the gas isnt getting through some how but it was driving us crazy. She just had it tuned up for this year so we thought we were good to go...I did bring the gas line that connects up to the motor home with me; it has seen better days and was going to take it into the marine place where she had it tuned. The primer bulb didnt want to keep firm so I dunno....maybe we just need a new line? kind of frustrating to say the least as she just got the boat last year from her cottage neighbour.. any thoughts greatly appreciated.. thanks Richard"
342018,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-16 01:16:00,947,you try pumping the Bulb as you put it in gear to see if it still dies.  Even if you rev it up a bit and put it in gear it dies?
342019,Muskieman,2009-05-16 01:32:00,2472,It might sound stupid but... I did this myself today....  My hose was on backwards..  first time in 25 yrs or so.  
342035,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-16 02:53:00,947,Another great possibility the bulb should be closest to the tank or an arrow pointing to the motor
342036,irishfield,2009-05-16 02:57:00,26272,Or the check valve is just shot period in the bulb. My brand new 2007 9.9 Prokicker's bulb was a dud from day one and had to have it replaced under warrantee
342062,perodimi,2009-05-16 11:32:00,124,Another easy one to miss is to confirm the vent is open?
342125,ColdH20guy,2009-05-16 14:06:00,312,"thanks guys had me wondering about the 'backwards' application! I'm pretty sure the arrow was towards the motor...I'm going to taker 'er in today and see if they can tell..thanks for the replies.... here's a pic....(also seems to sit low with the weight of the motor and myself in it, although when it was running I was able to get it on plane at a decent speed but when in slow speed seemed to 'run high' at the bow.....need a big anchor at the front I guess! lol"
