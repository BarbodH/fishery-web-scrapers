341983,irishfield,2009-05-15 23:56:00,26272,1/4 is a tad hard to get a hold of and pull in. I'd go 3/8ths...

Don't opt for the cheap yellow polypropylene it does not hold knots very well and is tough on your hands. Lastly get a 4-6 foot length of chain to ad to the anchor end of your rope."
342097,jace,2009-05-16 12:50:00,472,"Or even better, use the buoy and ring trick to bring up an anchor."
342102,Greencoachdog,2009-05-16 12:54:00,8163,"1/4"" isn't that bad, but 3/8"" is better... I'd go with a nylon instead of the cheap poly crap though!!!"
