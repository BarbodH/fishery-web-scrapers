Looking to get out (in some back bays in the canoe) And also off shore spots in the kawarthas. Any help would be greatly appreciated. PMs are OK  thanks again. Sorry i guess i should say that i was trout222 but was having some problems with my account so i switched up and i am glad to be back.

After school, the neighbour, his 9 year old and I fished from shore for a couple of hours before Supper.  We were at the Viamede/Mt. Julian public boat launch on Stoney Lake.  It was tough casting into the wind, but we managed to catch seven or eight Crappie and a bunch of big Sunfish."
