Looking for something that i can hook my reg propane tank to since my turkey cooker goes with us also.  Any ideas would be great!"

341548,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-14 22:05:00,10439,I have one of these stainless table top jobs that is 3 years old now and works great.  Portable BBQ    I bought the hose adapter to hook it to a 20# tank as well.  Hose Adapter    I also have a cheap table top BBQ for camping but it has issues running off the larger tanks (5 and 20 pound).

341699,brifishrgy,2009-05-15 03:16:00,559,I use the small cheapie one from wallmart  .. i paid under 20 bucks for it and it gets more use then the full size at home .. you will need the adapter hose to fit to your 20lbr
