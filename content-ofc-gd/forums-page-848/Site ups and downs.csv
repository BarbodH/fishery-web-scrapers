342055,Handlebarz,2009-05-16 07:54:00,3790,what the hell you sound surprised to here the Snocast for this weekend Tj I hope you did not forget what weekend this is if I were not so lazy I would search out at least one pick from each of the past 5 years on this weekend and remind you what weather you have up there. Heck this is the first year I am not heading away for this weekend I thought it would have been very nice like cold enough to keep the black flies away but no Blizzard. Well I am just waiting for my ride to go try for some lightning perch I just hope we get a break in the weather enough to fish.
