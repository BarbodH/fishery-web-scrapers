341561,Muskieman,2009-05-14 22:26:00,2472,The trade in value of my 1998 30 Evinrude T/ss.. is 1100.00$   Kijiji has one for 1400.00 and another for 1300.00  to give you an idea expect to pay somewhere around those prices.  Try to find the golden engine instead ' actually it's silver '    1993- 1995 Yamaha 30/ 3 cylinder they're bulletproof ...lighter than the comparable 25-30 and much much faster...  I've been looking for that outboard now for 10 yrs.   Good Luck...  RFS 
341604,Roy,2009-05-14 23:51:00,13728,"Just for a reference point, I bought a new motor last summer. I was going to trade my old one in ...it was a 1999 30hp 2 stroke Mariner. I could have traded it to the dealer but instead, my neighbour was having trouble with his motor and so I sold mine to him (less than 50 hours on it). I asked for $1,000. for it and I threw in the travel cover, a new spare gas tank and two spare re-built props. He was thrilled and I was happy with that. It was worth more though."
341607,Muskieman,2009-05-14 23:55:00,2472,  ROY!!!    You ripped yourself off and gave your neighbor an AWESOME deal...do you have anything else for sale?
341610,Roy,2009-05-15 00:03:00,13728," I didn't get ripped off Randy. He's my neighbour, I wasn't going to get a lot more from the dealer and the stuff that I threw in, I had no more use for anyway. So, everyone's happy."
341616,Muskieman,2009-05-15 00:12:00,2472,   True enough Roy.... but... your neighbor still got an AWESOME  deal..
