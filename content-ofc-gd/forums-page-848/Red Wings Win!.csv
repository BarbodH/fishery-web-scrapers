342058,Cudz,2009-05-16 11:22:00,2652,Don't like the wings at all.  If I want see European hockey I should go to Sweden.  The team is full of un-Canadians.  THe other 3 teams left have way more Canadians on it especially Chicago.  THey are a good team but I really don't want them to win.
341662,Stoty,2009-05-15 01:43:00,2910,"Wooooooooo, I smell back to back Cups!!  Have to hand it to Anaheim though...they gave them all they could handle!"
341664,Lunker777,2009-05-15 01:46:00,866,Best game of the playoffs ! That was intense hahah   GO WINGS GO !
341668,Stoty,2009-05-15 01:48:00,2910,Ya it sure was! Fantastic game!  That Bull call on Hudler with goalie interference....wow.
341680,kickingfrog,2009-05-15 02:12:00,8333," I am sure you smell something.... better check your livewell.   Lots of empty seats in hokey town, you could get tickets and fish the river."
341701,Stoty,2009-05-15 03:28:00,2910,Looks like it will be a PIT/DET final again this year! Can't wait to see Crosby cry again!
341726,gone_fishin,2009-05-15 05:42:00,481,i might quit watching hockey if the Red Wings win it again this year!
341735,danc,2009-05-15 07:59:00,4677,I'm looking forward to the Carolina/ Pittsburgh series. Staal vs Staal. A couple of home town boys going head to head.
341738,alphaalpha,2009-05-15 08:42:00,475,"The wings are looking good, the ducks had no business making it that tight of a series.  i have never seen so many bounces/calls go one teams way in my life.  thankfully the better team prevailed"
341748,snoil,2009-05-15 10:57:00,139,GO HAWKS!!!
341750,ColdH20guy,2009-05-15 11:01:00,312,i might quit watching hockey if the Red Wings win it again this year!  I hear ya! Cant stand the Wings...huge Ducks fan here...cant believe all the Duck bashing...easy guys lol  GO Hawks..please!
341752,Lunker777,2009-05-15 11:17:00,866,IMO this has been the best playoffs in a while.... 3/4 series going to game 7 in the quarters ????  Its been a great last couple of weeks thats forsure !
341763,blaque,2009-05-15 11:47:00,2419," i triple that............they equate to my hatred for the Cowboys of the NFL.  I say give it to someone new and make it exciting.........Chicago being the best to fit that description. Theyve been out of it for a long time, it'd be good to see. Instead of detroit fans going......ohhhhh, another stanley cup, uh, yeah , thats pretty cool. errrrr awesome."
341772,Lunker777,2009-05-15 12:18:00,866," Is that what all the Montreal fans said when they won so many cups ???  I love watchin Detroit win the cup year after year.... its gives all the HATERS something to talk about  The team is good... thats the point. So they win ! I mean, it will EVENTUALLY run out, but Im enjoyin it while it lasts.  By the way... Osgoods still got it !"
341785,anders,2009-05-15 13:03:00,1168," He never lost it!  The guy is awsome!  As for the wings...yeah...im no fan...Anaheim was a lot better team than the 8th seed..they peaked at the right time, unfortunate someone had to lose that game.  Same thing with the damn canes.Errrrrrrrr  Definitly thought my Bruins had that one signed sealed and delivered....that was an awsome game as well."
341799,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-15 13:27:00,3761,"Good game and i was for Detroit but that 4th goal where buddy was shoving the goalies pad into the net...come on that should of been a call, shoving the goalie into the net, should of been interference."
341801,BillM,2009-05-15 13:40:00,17367,"Definitely did a great job at pushing that goalie pad in  I hope they meet Chicago, it would be one hell of a series."
341804,blaque,2009-05-15 14:57:00,2419,"yeah, you could even see it at the post game handshake, the goaltender was still PI$$ED!!!! He was not ready to shake hands thats for sure.........he had this poubt on his face and wouldnt even look at the wings players and wouldnt say anything to them. Poor kid."
341808,Lunker777,2009-05-15 15:08:00,866," You may be right.... But you gotta remember, I believe it was game 3 or 4..... When the Wings CLEARLY scored a goal in regulation time with about 2 seconds left... and they disaloud it, because time ""ran out"" hmmm... whats the excuse for that one Ducks fans ?  Im pretty sure Hiller wasn't pouting then.... more like grimising because there was a MASSIVE horse shoe in his   !!!!  The kids a great goalie. But to quote one of my fav movies ( Happy Gilmour ) "" Better luck next year """
341816,blaque,2009-05-15 15:29:00,2419,"i didnt catch all of this series, but are you talking about the Hossa goal with about 2 minutes left in game 3  when the puck wasnt covered up and went in the net to tie it up at 2...........only the ref blew the whistle for some reason with the puck laying out in nomans land for the taking. Yeah, id say that one was a horshoe in the pants of the ducks. Still hate the wings though"
341829,Flappn,2009-05-15 15:51:00,245,"HHHAAAAWWWKKKKSSS! Going to be a good series...but I think those young ""Great Canadian Kids"" are going to take it!"
341835,blaque,2009-05-15 16:02:00,2419," Huh, the canadians were sent packing way back in round one?"
341846,irishfield,2009-05-15 16:20:00,26272,"I wanna see Carolina win it, just so Toronto can see that it wasn't the coach....."
341866,blaque,2009-05-15 17:12:00,2419, bite your tongue
341931,DJM1983DJM,2009-05-15 21:53:00,3,another detroit win by pushing the goalies pad into the net! way to go team. thats about 6 games won by interfering with the goalie.but yea... detroit is the best... *LAUGHS* maybe they should come back to the eastern conference and see how well they do....
341946,danada,2009-05-15 22:26:00,31,I'm just glad Pronger is done for the year.
