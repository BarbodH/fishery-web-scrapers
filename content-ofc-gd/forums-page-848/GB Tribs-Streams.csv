Anything from brook trout to browns to bows in the Parry Sound area that I can walk the river/stream and fish.  I'm willing to travel a bit (South to Barrie area or any 2 hour radius from Parry Sound).  I'm new to the area and have checked out Google maps but I'm not sure what water(s) hold fish, specifically trout along Georgian Bay.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

341619,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-15 00:16:00,0,there's no reserve in town.
341653,Musky or Specks,2009-05-15 01:36:00,2710,Stream wise there is not alot. Canadian shield is no great trout factory water. Check out the upper Coldwater only thing I can think of. Not sure what access is like.
