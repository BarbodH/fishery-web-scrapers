340080,TJQ,2009-05-10 22:09:00,7806,"Haven't had much useful to report up here whilst we wait for the snow to finally depart, but Thursday, me and a buddy (Tookie) hightailed it up to camp to see what the winter had done to it and get started on a new screened in porch for the front of the main camp.  There was still some snow on most of the road in.. Almost got stuck a couple of times.     A few new washouts on the way in, but these will flatten oust and make it more passable anyway    Got to camp to find the water higher than ever.  it was at least 7 feet higher than normal summer levels.  Im thankful the dock didn't flat away... the boats chained down, thanks goodness, lesson learned - haul that boat WAY up next year!      Went out to Kirkland Lake  to get the lumber needed and bumped into this fatty!! See you in the fall!  Lots of bush chickens around, hopefully we'll have a good crop this summer.    Got the lumber and got loaded (LOL).. 4 loads at 1 hour round trip apiece.    Cleaned off the debris on the porch and started framing.. I'm not much of a carpenter, but it wound up being really solid.    Natures cooler!        Then the weather got crappy... and stayed that way.            Any way were 75% done... going in next to finish the roof, paint it and install the door and panels...  but I should have it done before the bugs.. then I can go fishing!!  Ill have to edit out the steeple though..."
