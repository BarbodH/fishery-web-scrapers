My buddy told me to shore fish Sturgeon Lake this weekend, but i google maped it and sturgeon lake is milessssssssss away. AM I WRONG? SO im assuming he ment lake scugog... he Told me the Lake has got some decent shore fishing for walleye (we got skunked during the night in campellford on tues) Does anyone know any spots? Does the lake contain Pike/crappie? I might head out to hastings but it will be packed because this weekend is the opener for that sanctuary.  Could anyone direct me to any shore fishing spots? I know the rules, and i dont want no honey holes and i aint no dumb trespassing poluting dude. but it is my bday this weekend and i dying to catch sum bday fishies! Any help guys?  lets hope monday ive got a report!  THanks! Pachone  On and i live in durham"

202812,Rich,2008-05-17 03:28:00,3927,"No pike but lots of crappies and walleye, though fishing there without a boat may prove difficult. Try Bobcaygeon, Lindsay or Fenelon Falls for better shore fishing opportunities."
