Plaus Park. Offenders will be charged under a municipal by-law. Fishing is still allowed in the Port Credit Memorial Park area of the harbour, as well as J.C. Saddington Park. Please refer to the city's web site for more information. - City of Mississauga   I went to the website and all I can find it this:  Fishing  Lakefront Promenade park offers anglers shore fishing opportuinies for pan fish, trout, salmon, bass and pike. The harbour is located 4 km from the mouth of the Credit River. The Credit River and Lake Ontario provide anglers with world class Salmon and Trout fishing opportunities from land and by boat.  Anyone?"

Never had a problem with the police, but better whatch out for the port authority in metro too..  they're quick with their radios hahah  It's only a matter of time for the harbour.."
341779,charlesn,2009-05-15 12:55:00,551,"I think they are talking about the boardwalk that surrounds the marina.  There are signs posted there about the no fishing.  The boardwalk to the east where the 4 sisters used to be is fine for fishing.  There's a nice ledge at the far east end by the retaining wire that was created by the current that used to pump out of the generating station that used to hold nice bass and carp.  In the fall I used to see salmon (presumably lost) and trout in there and I think the Ontario record brown trout was caught out of the hot water discharge, but I could be misremembering.  I haven't been back (to fish) since the demolition of the stacks, but I take my daughters down for a walk quite often and have not seen many people fishing there.  I recall lots more people fishing there when the hot water discharge attracted the bait which attracted the predators.  Last weekend I was there and saw 1 small moldy (had some fungus on it) sunfish by the walking bridge and nesting swan, that was it.  Thought I would see some pike, smallies or largies in the harbour, but nothing.  I'd agree with Highdrifter that your chances of finding fish are better west of there.  Good luck."
