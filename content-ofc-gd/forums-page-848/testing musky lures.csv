341386,rbaquial,2009-05-14 14:02:00,968," Speaking of Lew, where has he been? I haven't seen any recent posts from him lately?"

341412,e-z-out,2009-05-14 15:18:00,1052,Lew is living the life right now but i might run into him this weekend.
341416,setomonkey,2009-05-14 15:26:00,872,We usually see some updates from Lew when he heads back to TO to take care of things...  Mike
341521,bassmaster4,2009-05-14 20:38:00,801,you could tell that guy was having a lot of fun smacking those lures off the ground
341533,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-14 21:29:00,947,Dang it i was hoping he would hook himself
341540,Twocoda,2009-05-14 21:51:00,4130,"Since he has a vested interest in the Super D i wonder how hard he was ""straightening"" out the competitions lure when it ventured off camera several times???  Personally i would think using the lures head to head and keeping a running tally of the damage after every fish might seem more prone to deliver the message ...after all ...how much damage can a lure get if it doesn't catch fish ...  just my .02"

341584,kickingfrog,2009-05-14 23:10:00,8333,"I usually try not to hit the rocks when I'm casting my musky baits??? And despite what some of my fishing partners will tell you, I have never repeatedly cast onto the middle of someones driveway.  Valid test."
341745,outllaw,2009-05-15 10:51:00,1232,man we have built thousands over the years. that is a very different way. maybe he should flog a horse
