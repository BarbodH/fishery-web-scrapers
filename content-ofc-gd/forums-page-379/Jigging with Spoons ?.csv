I dont think i have seen many posts in here on the subject.It seems we all troll cranks,worm harnesses, of use jig heads and plastics. How many of you use jigging spoons, and maybe you would like to share some of your successful technics with me and the others wondering the same thing"
720457,Rod Caster,2012-08-05 23:49:00,5784,"Ice fishing, its almost all I use for walleye. I don't as much in the summer, simply because I rarely use an anchor which makes it hard to jig a spoons.  I always found aggressive, quick jigs to be the key to triggering them. They'll often hit on the fall... So you only notice on the next upward motion. This works for nipissing... But I'm sure it would work elsewhere."
720482,mercman,2012-08-06 01:39:00,7054,"I am gonna give them a shot, next time i am drift jigging for walleye in deeper water. Just one more addition to the arsenal Things like Erie Deeries,where you can add a worm or grub to the  single hook would work really well drift jigging too,i suspect."
720485,manitoubass2,2012-08-06 01:44:00,11391,The Fergie spoons are deadly on big walleye grounds in the winter
720487,mercman,2012-08-06 01:56:00,7054, I see that most people use them through the ice.Anyone use them in the summer? i have read that they are just as effective anchored and slow drifting.
720491,mike rousseau,2012-08-06 02:19:00,4661,They are best in cold water Paul... Mid oct to mid June...
720507,gaspumper,2012-08-06 04:17:00,393,"Jigging rapalas are great in the summer in water 25ft and deeper, just drifting slow.At least on Quinte."
720544,Broker,2012-08-06 12:57:00,482,Saw some people jigging spoons for lake trout out of a canoe just a couple of weeks ago. I saw them land one laker so it must work
720640,ehg,2012-08-06 21:59:00,2666," Jigging spoons are pretty good for walleye off the bottom in deeper water.  Usually i would tip them with a minnow hooked through skull to remain on hook.  Let them go to bottom(preferably rock) take up slack and give quick snap upwards about 5 ft. or more. Let spoon flutter to bottom again. Repeat. Many times fish will pick up lure as it falls so watch line to see if it stops falling. Sometimes the fish will press bottom of jaw on lure at bottom of lake. Therefore it is good to wait a few seconds before ripping up again. I guess that's why its called rip jigging. Have caught pike, bass and mudpuppies as well this way. Preferably you would do best with little wind and a fishful spot. Hope this helps."

The always help me pick off active fish from a school before slowing down and working fish you see on the screen. Walleye are predators...make them chase an aggressive bait, Fergies are deadly cast over sand/mud flats and snapped in. Great river baits too."
