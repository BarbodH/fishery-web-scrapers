720384,Acal57,2012-08-05 18:56:00,10,Going out for pike with my dad tomorrow. I really want to get my old man back into fishing and for that I need some success. Now I figure the fish will be deep to avoid the heat. Where is the deepest water in Wildwood lake? We don't have a depthfinder. I'm thinking of using worms (or minnows if I can find an open bait shop on a holiday Monday) on drop shot rigs or jig heads. Maybe some soft plastic drop shot rigs as well. Any advice?
720388,ChrisK,2012-08-05 19:04:00,2772,In the past we would go around the outer edges of the lake casting under the bushes starting right on the other side of the ramp and slowly work your way down to the culvert at the end of the lake and then head up the other side in the same manner. Its pretty much a hole days fishing...  Good Luck !!
720410,Acal57,2012-08-05 19:48:00,10,I usually beat shore lines too but I was thinking that because of the extreme heat the fish will be deeper. Are there any deep holes in the lake? Like near the dam maybe?
720436,Woodsman,2012-08-05 21:20:00,1286,Out in front of the dam center of the lake is the deepest area. Should be around 30' maybe slightly more now. Try dragging tube jigs along the bottom slowly.
