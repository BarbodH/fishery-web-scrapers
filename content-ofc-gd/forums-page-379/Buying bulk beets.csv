720177,davey buoy,2012-08-04 18:02:00,5505, I would think the market at 400& canal rd.would have them ?.If they don't that ain't right.
720178,misfish,2012-08-04 18:07:00,29133,"  No sir. Canning. Our former provider,has retired.  Yea were going for a drive in the morning Dave."
720179,Skipper D,2012-08-04 18:12:00,1970,"Hewitts road side stands all around Barrie , bayfeild st just north of carson road on the right , but are beets read now ?????"
720180,misfish,2012-08-04 18:15:00,29133,"Yes Ron,they are. Thanks"
720187,wvfisherman,2012-08-04 18:54:00,34,I enjoy beets also.  How do you peel your beet?  Boil or wrap and bake in the oven.  It would take long time to peel a bushel of beets.
720190,misfish,2012-08-04 20:11:00,29133,"We just boil and peel. No problem. I even like to eat them as were canning.All natural.  The tops are another great table fair.But when your buying bulk,we don,t get them. Swiss chard, is the next best thing."
720193,Terry,2012-08-04 20:34:00,14456,do you pee red if you eat too many of them??????????  lol
720227,bow slayer,2012-08-04 23:17:00,1074,"  yes,but it is more closer to purple,usually after eating half a jar. The wife is doing some as I post."
720231,Terry,2012-08-04 23:25:00,14456,making beets or peeing
720362,misfish,2012-08-05 17:29:00,29133,"Well we found them today.  Jars of Ruby cubes, are jarred..  Cant wait, to dig into them when their done.  "
720374,bigugli,2012-08-05 18:11:00,6138,Looks good. Probably taste even better.
720376,misfish,2012-08-05 18:19:00,29133,"Im looking for a GOOD,pickled egg canning now.Got one Bruce?"
720391,Leecher,2012-08-05 19:07:00,7832, You can't beet beat homemade pickle beats beets   I stand corrected  Question B:  How many jars yielded out of a bushell???
720393,misfish,2012-08-05 19:13:00,29133,"We could,nt find them in a bushel basket. Bought two quarts at the local market. Made 9 small jars. Buying this way,it,s over costly. Funny,we traveled a bit this morning to local farm venues. No one is really growing them in bunches.  Canning the beets is great,but the tops are the real treat in my opinion.There were no tops today."
720398,Leecher,2012-08-05 19:22:00,7832," Ah I see, thanks B... My wife and I use to make them too... They're so easy to make and SO GOOD!!!  Will be making bread & butter soon    Once the temps drop to a normal level that is    Too hot right now"
720400,ctranter,2012-08-05 19:25:00,543,How far is Schrute Farms from here?
720403,misfish,2012-08-05 19:30:00,29133,
720431,NAW,2012-08-05 21:01:00,4022,Sorry to by chiming in so late.  There is a farmers market in Elmvale.  It's every Friday from 9 till 2 (crappy hours  :wallbash: )  They might be able to get you a bushel if you still need it.  http://www.springwater.ca/cms/One.aspx?portalId=312&pageId=8981
720434,misfish,2012-08-05 21:08:00,29133,"  I think you got some good planting grounds Nick.  Hope the mrs,s and wee one are doing well.Getting close eh."
720444,bigugli,2012-08-05 22:26:00,6138,A lot of roadside stands don't sell bushels. Not enough mark up unless they produce bulk.
