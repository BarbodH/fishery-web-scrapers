720156,Mike Pike,2012-08-04 14:43:00,1332,"Packed my fishin’ vest with an assortment of grubs and jigs yesterday morning, and headed out to Brant County with my niece’s husband, Steven.  We arrived just before sun up and carefully made our way into the river.  The idea was to pitch our jigs and burn ‘em back near the surface avoiding the rocks and thick weeds in the river.  My first cast, I had a fish on that humbled me by spitting the hook.  Unfortunately, this was to be my pattern for most of the morning.  Steven, meanwhile, made his hook-set count and got on the board early with a fish.    Followed by another, very quickly afterwards.    In fact, Steven probably had six fish before I was able to catch my first.    It was a great morning with good numbers.  Steven’s tally was 15, while yours truly nabbed about half that.  And I thought I was gonna be the one teachng him a thing or two about catching fish.  lol  "

720336,Spiel,2012-08-05 15:40:00,9065, Agreed!   I wondered the same thing......
720340,Mike Pike,2012-08-05 16:01:00,1332,"Not much 'insulation' on this frame, Spiel.  lol"
720341,Spiel,2012-08-05 16:08:00,9065," Really, well drop in any time Mike I can help you add insulation/bulk."
720379,Mike Pike,2012-08-05 18:28:00,1332,"Thanks Spiel.  That is darn nice of ya!  And I agree with everyone who posted about the fighting qualities of river Smallmouth.  The fish themsleves are lean and tough. Then you add their jumping ability, current, etc., and you've got a fight on your hands, from even the smaller fish.  Pound for pound..."
720433,Leecher,2012-08-05 21:05:00,7832, I couldn't agree more   Smallies are fun to catch   Big or small... you get your money's worth Great report Mike Pike!!! Thanks for sharing TJunkie
