719782,aplumma,2012-08-02 23:11:00,6896,"Yup surely is a lucky skunk if he doesn't build a nest under the deck while you are gone your ""lucky"".  See yaa Sunday Lew  Art"
720035,esoxansteel,2012-08-03 20:15:00,1307,"Hope you and Diane have a great time, im sure she will be happy to be your net gal, and might even show you a thing or 2 about catchin skis as well, i might get out to that lake where you had your trailer on for the first time this year to hopefully catch a muskie or 2 on the fly."
720041,lew,2012-08-03 20:41:00,12766,"Thanks Steve, I'll be doing my best to put both my daughter and my wife on their 1st 50""er each this trip."
720042,misfish,2012-08-03 20:44:00,29133,Dont forget your leaders Lew.  You and Dianne have a great 2 weeks.
720054,lew,2012-08-03 21:44:00,12766," I don't have any, I gave them all to you   :lol:"

720093,glen,2012-08-04 00:47:00,2641,"50""ers why set the bar so low?  Good luck and i hope you all get one."
720099,mistyriver1,2012-08-04 01:04:00,600,Have a good trip Lew !
720163,ehg,2012-08-04 16:31:00,2666,Bit off topic but... Saw a skunk in my backyard right here in downtown T.O. last night. Called my daughter over to check it out. The skunk was obviously scared of us and was looking for way out. There was a spot where the fence was about 21/2 inches off ground. The skunk flattened out and crawled through this space. Couldn't believe it  did this. Musta just been enough room to get skull and rib cage through. Don't think the 50 lb. racoons see around here could do that.
719337,lew,2012-08-01 09:43:00,12766,I'm getting things packed for this Saturday's 2 week musky trip up to Lakair and last evening as I came out onto the back deck heading to put some gear in the boat I met up with this little furry guy in the back yard.  Can't be a very good omen for an up-coming fish'n trip  
719338,Terry,2012-08-01 09:47:00,14456,"as long as you leave the skunk at home, you should have a good trip"
719339,lew,2012-08-01 09:54:00,12766,Just so long as he doesn't follow me north
719340,Fish Farmer,2012-08-01 10:26:00,2234,Don't let him spray your boat Lew and make sure no bananas in the boat. Can't wait to see the trophy pictures when you get back. OH! delete that Skunk picture from your camera. Maybe a little superstitious Good luck Lew
719344,Skipper D,2012-08-01 10:52:00,1970,"You'll be fine Lew , looks like he's going the other way ........lol"
719378,fishnsled,2012-08-01 14:19:00,3520,"Best to get the skunk out of the way on your ""home turf"" before you make the trek to musky haven.  Good luck Lew and have great trip!"
719379,NAW,2012-08-01 14:23:00,4022,It is a sign..  Use a big black and white lure..  That'll be the ticket! 
719380,RangerGuy,2012-08-01 14:23:00,564,Yes leave that skunk at home!... Might be a wet weekend calling for thunder storms both Saturday and Sunday.
719391,adempsey,2012-08-01 15:05:00,1498,What's the problem?  I just see musky bait.
719397,lew,2012-08-01 15:21:00,12766,"Hmmmm, never thought about using that little critter as bait"
719399,fishnsled,2012-08-01 15:28:00,3520,"  I know of a guy that does his own bucktails and swears by using skunk fur. Lots of roadkill to get supplies from. Says the smell drives the muskies crazy and it lasts a longtime on the baits. Not sure that I want that smell in my boat but he does very well in his. And yes I am serious, seen the baits and they smell like skunk. Asked if he'd sell me a couple and was told sure! Just have to go and get my own skunk fur.  I still don't have any baits."
719401,lew,2012-08-01 15:33:00,12766,"I think I agree with you on the road kill Will  Hafta admit though, one of my favorite trolling baits is a 10"" black Believer with a white stripe running thru it. Can't buy that pattern anymore but it's still an easy colour to re paint when another colour isn't working."
719410,John,2012-08-01 16:10:00,2956,Have a great week Lew. Say hi to the rest of the crew for me. Wish I was able to be there next week but as you know we will see you the week after..
719413,lew,2012-08-01 16:15:00,12766,"Looking forward to spending the week with you & Barb, John.  See you guys on the 11th."
719415,corvette1,2012-08-01 16:21:00,1765,just go get a big ski lew can't wait to hear how big have fun
719428,GBW,2012-08-01 17:04:00,8460,"Well Lew, have a good one.  at least your boat didn't flip in the storms yesterday; on top of the skunk walking around."
719433,Default User,2012-08-01 17:20:00,72, LOL
719549,Nipfisher,2012-08-02 02:29:00,2449,"Lew, You'll have a ""stinking"" good time."
719589,skeeter,2012-08-02 10:50:00,1907, Live bait works best Lew.....  :rofl2:
719601,outllaw,2012-08-02 12:05:00,1232,"a distant cousin pepe le pew. coax him on board. he,s an extra rod for fishin and no one will screw with your gear"
719606,doubleheader,2012-08-02 12:14:00,497,Looks like a nice playmate for Marvin Lew.
719607,lew,2012-08-02 12:17:00,12766," Marvins tangled with a few skunks in his time Fred, but so far he hasn't noticed this guy....yet"
719610,cram,2012-08-02 12:23:00,1733,Lew - you can still get turbo-skunk colored believers.
719611,lew,2012-08-02 12:31:00,12766,"Thanks cram, I was under the impression it was discontinued."
719614,cram,2012-08-02 12:42:00,1733, There's a section in their webstore called Historical Colors.  You'll find it there.  Night Shiner is also a pretty good color.
