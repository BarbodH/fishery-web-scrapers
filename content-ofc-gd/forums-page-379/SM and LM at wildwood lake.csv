361064,Bass Tard,2009-07-12 00:30:00,128,Is that lake in St. Marys?  Can I take my boat on there with a 50 horse?  How big is the lake?
361082,gino,2009-07-12 01:08:00,400,"bass trap...wildwood is a pretty big long lake...i only have a canoe and i always go in the back of the lake in shallow water, but i think you can put your boat in water at the marina, where the conservation is..."
361088,oxcowboy,2009-07-12 01:30:00,544,"nice fish, im sure it was fun.  try some of the Yum dingers in 5 inch size, cheaper than senkos and have always worked well for me on bass.  jason"
361118,gino,2009-07-12 03:03:00,400,"thank you, oxcowboy...you're right, they look like senkos and i believe they wil do the job, i'll try them"
361123,BassAsin,2009-07-12 03:09:00,806,"nice looking bass Gino, as for the senkos i'm guess i went through close to 40 already this season! they go quick when the bite is on!"
361182,IndySKS,2009-07-12 10:43:00,134," Yes Wildwood lake near St. Marys will allow you to use you boat with a 50 hp...i dont think there is any limit on HP unlike Fanshaw or Pittock. The dock is in the conservation area for the larger boats. Some people with canoes come in off of the bridges that are at the far end of the lake. The main portion of the lake is about 5 miles long and then there is a  bridge and no gas powered bots are allowed beyond there but if you have an electric or a canoe it's a nice calm area to fish.  This section is about 2 miles long before the lake runs out and it gets really shallow with stumps, just be careful if you go past the second bridge.  This LM came out of there yesterday morning  "

361478,gino,2009-07-13 14:09:00,400,you guys are welcome...it's already good only to be out on the water...but when u get some fish is even better...
719564,WLF68,2012-08-02 03:17:00,2,that canoe is the same one as mine. The shallow end was pretty muddy. Which bridge do you go from?
719570,i2cool2fool,2012-08-02 03:35:00,349,Wildwood is a great local spot for me. I docked my boat there the past 3 years. I plan to hit Long Point and other waters this year and didn't renew. I was thinking of getting up to Wildwood this weekend. Thanks for the reports.
719622,Christopheraaron,2012-08-02 13:19:00,3525,"Thanks for that. Mostly because I have that heddon torpedo, never got anything on it, now I'm excited!"
720279,WLF68,2012-08-05 04:12:00,2,I was fishing all afternoon and I only caught this one around 7:30. 
720283,wormdunker,2012-08-05 11:12:00,1711,"Nice bass.  U guys rock!  Guess u could say U were ""kickin bass"""
720298,Weeds,2012-08-05 12:12:00,782,Are you using a rubber o-ring on those Senkos? Makes a big difference as far as durability goes; sometimes you can get a full days fishing off a single worm. I find I never do as well using any of the other brands of plastic worms; the extra 20 or 30 cents a worm is worth it in my books.
