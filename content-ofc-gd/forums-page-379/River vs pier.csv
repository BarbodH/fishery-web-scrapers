For those who fishes both off the pier and in the rivers for salmon/steelhead, when would you guys go pier fishing and when would you guys do river fishing? Both seems productive for the sport of fishing in the fall.  Regards, D"
720480,northernpike56,2012-08-06 01:34:00,717,"piers first, you should start going down and fishing them at night in a few weeks for staging salmon, then about mid sept-early october you should fish the creeks for them (provided that the creek is still open of course). Steelhead and brown trout usually follow a bit after salmon and can be caught all winter long.  "
720502,jeffw,2012-08-06 03:07:00,267,afew salmon already up rivers.
720651,Christopheraaron,2012-08-06 23:11:00,3525, You sure?
720688,Broker,2012-08-07 01:23:00,482,"With it being so hot and dry, id think it would delay the run.. Just my two cents"
720692,northernpike56,2012-08-07 01:34:00,717,"agreed, but you still should get a few showing up around the piers in a few weeks. Try fishing at night with glow-in-the-dark cleo spoons. You'll want to bring a lantern and a net with an extendable handle too.  Matt."
