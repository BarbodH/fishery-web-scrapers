720129,largemouthtrout,2012-08-04 05:05:00,53,"  They aren't nudists . They are retired and on CPP . if you can only afford 2 of the following 3 items , which would they be .  1 - a pack of native smokes  2 - a 12 pack of moose tallboys  3 - a pair of biege polyester pants that buckle up under your armpits"
