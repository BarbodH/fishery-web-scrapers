720483,RickOnt,2012-08-06 01:40:00,669,For a day fishing!  Dalrymple for sure.   Rick
720490,snagged,2012-08-06 02:14:00,67,I appreciate the reply Rick.  I did a search on the 2 lakes and I've decided to try dalrymple lake.  Not keeping any of the fish so I'll be happy with catching a few hammer handle pike and bass if I'm lucky.
720539,RickOnt,2012-08-06 12:29:00,669,You might even find a Walleye or 2.  Rick
