720048,laszlo,2012-08-03 21:21:00,487,"Haven't been doing too much 'serious fishing' as of late. Spring and Fall are both my favorite times of the year to fish.  Family events have taken over the summer as expected. Here are a few pics from my local spots...as well as a few from up north.         This was taken just before summer began. There were tons of the little invasive guys around. The MNR took care them!    I never had a Mink run right up to my feet before. I thought he was going to crawl right up my leg.          As much as most anglers don't care for carp, I really like targetting them with a Pin and Fly set up.          Almost stepped on this guy.     Hopefully my next post will be with some fresh steel!  Take care, Laszlo"
720064,solopaddler,2012-08-03 22:08:00,8605,Nice pic's! Carp on the fly sounds pretty cool.
720115,hammercarp,2012-08-04 02:52:00,964,Great pictures. Thanks for posting them. I have never tried fly fishing for carp. Maybe one day.
720123,spinnerbaitking,2012-08-04 04:12:00,1622,Some Great Pictures & a nice report Tight Lines SBK
720145,Broker,2012-08-04 12:43:00,482,"have tried throwing flies at carp, they sure dont want anything to do with my wooly bugger !"
720147,laszlo,2012-08-04 12:56:00,487," I too can't get them to go after a wooly bugger. Try wooly worms and stone fly nymphs.  The trick is to cast at them when they are feeding and present the fly with as little action as possible directly in front of their faces when they are mudding.  When they have finished feeding are are in shut down mode it's next to impossible to get them to take. I only have one fly for that situation. Don't know the name of it but it's big, green, fat and looks kind of like a June Bug. No action is key again and they simply can not resist it."
720162,Christopheraaron,2012-08-04 16:08:00,3525,"You can't use flies that are too big, max size 8 hooks, my favourites are small beadhead nymphs and a fly I made up which is a size 10 hook with white sheepshair on the back and a little bit of red fox hair underneath.  But honestly if you put it in front of their faces they will eat it. cast about a foot away from them, let it sink about 6 inches and strip it back letting it fall in between, when they suck it up don't set the hook right away but instead watch your leader and wait for it to move before setting it."
720164,Jon,2012-08-04 16:39:00,209,"What is the invasive creature in the photo? Looks like a lamprey to me. If so, are you sure it wasn't a native Brook Lamprey?  Jon"
720167,laszlo,2012-08-04 16:51:00,487, MNR said it was a sea lamprey. They were everywhere.
720170,ehg,2012-08-04 17:01:00,2666,Carp on fly fishing gear is impressive. Excellent report!
720198,Broker,2012-08-04 20:53:00,482,Thanks for the suggestion laszlo! Next time I'm at my bass spot and see a big carp lurking around ill try er out
720354,MJL,2012-08-05 17:06:00,2427,That's awesome Laz. Really enjoyed this report  Which model pontoon are you running? Definitely interested in picking up one for this coming fall.
720367,timmeh,2012-08-05 17:42:00,609,"Nice report. I've had a lot of fun targeting carp on the fly too this summer.  Anyone with a fly rod looking for a challenge should give them a try.  I've actually had a lot of success with large (size 2), dark colored wooly buggers. I've been targeting cruising fish and twitching it on bottom as they get close. Must be feeding on different food sources."
720532,laszlo,2012-08-06 12:00:00,487, It's an Outcast from BPS. It's good for the price($450.00)but there are better ones out there. I don't use it too often so it does the job.  Going down a river on one is awesome!
720535,laszlo,2012-08-06 12:02:00,487, Targeting cruising fish is fun too. That moment when you see the fish turn towards the fly...and...bam!
