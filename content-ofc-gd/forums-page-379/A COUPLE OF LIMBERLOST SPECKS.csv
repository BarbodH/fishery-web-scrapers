720343,Rod Caster,2012-08-05 16:17:00,5784,"Cut off head, gut them, then stuff the cavity with salt, pepper, butter, garlic and onions. Wrap in tinfoil and bake at 350. Just one idea."
720346,Leecher,2012-08-05 16:24:00,7832," Simon, I'm here    Best way to cook these beauties is to remove the head & fins, drop them into a hot pan with a dab of butter, salt & pepper and garlic salt to taste... that's it, that's all     Make sure you open them up like a butterfly first and sear a couple of minutes, flip on each side and enjoy!  Here's the link to my report I made some time ago  Speckle Papillon"
720349,Pikeslayer,2012-08-05 16:30:00,1443," Thx Chad. They were cleaned/gutted within a half hour of being caught. Iced and vacuum sealed and in the freezer same day, so I'm hoping they taste as close to fresh as possible. Believe it or not, I can't remember having ever eaten speckies, so I just want to make sure any ingredients don't over power the taste of the meat. Looking for simple and yummy. Anybody else? Jacques?"
720350,Pikeslayer,2012-08-05 16:33:00,1443, Haha! Merci mon ami That's exactly what I'm looking for. I'll post the picks later.
