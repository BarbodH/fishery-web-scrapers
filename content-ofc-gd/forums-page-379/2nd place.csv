720213,mike rousseau,2012-08-04 22:16:00,4661,Had a great day today in our local tourney....  We ended up getting second place with 17.45lbs for 3 walleye....  First was 18.25lbs or so with big fish being over 8lbs...  It was great.... We had our 3 biggest fish in about the first hour of the day so the pressure was off early...  Ended up boating 11 or 12 walleye today...  All around awesome day and now it's beers and pizza with the family to celibrate....

720218,Gregoire,2012-08-04 22:42:00,1397,Is that the Lancaster tourney? If so I remember going to it as a kid.
720219,mike rousseau,2012-08-04 22:48:00,4661," It's out of lancaster but your probably thinking the walleye masters tourny maybe...  That used to be the summer tourny..., but hasn't been done in years.... We have been trying to establish an anual tourny for a handful of years now..."
