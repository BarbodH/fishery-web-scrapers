720588,smally21,2012-08-06 17:43:00,993,Finally found the country property after years of looking. For real this time. Sold the house (firmed up this week) and outta here in 3 weeks. Needed a new tractor for the grass cutting and after some intense searching decided on this husky..    I have other orange husky stuff i like things to match..its a 24V48LS for those of you that like model#s. Its patiently waiting in the garage right now.

720592,smally21,2012-08-06 17:56:00,993,"I'm kinda new to cutting grass with a lawn tractor, so i'll keep both hands on the wheel for a bit. if the cupholder sloshes around a lot i will wear one of those helmets with the beer can holders. ya know, to stay safe."
720603,mercman,2012-08-06 18:25:00,7054,"  Nice wheels !!! I bet the optional accessories are enough to make a man weak in the knees too!!! Snowblower, grader,seeder,tiller,plow,etc. etc. etc."
720606,davey buoy,2012-08-06 18:37:00,5505,Nice ride!!!!!!!!!!I'm sure you'll love the extra property:good:
720630,HTHM,2012-08-06 20:54:00,4082,"As one rural(ish) landowner to another, you'll love it! What area are you going to be in?"
720650,i2cool2fool,2012-08-06 23:05:00,349,Totally agree.  Congrats to the OP on the new homestead.
720664,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-06 23:50:00,10439,It's fresh and fun now but after a while the fun wears off. We had 4+ acres of grass to cut at our last place in Ontario. After a few years cutting the grass just plain SUCKED!!!! Ended up spending almost every non-snowbound weekend cutting grass. It was a 16+ hour job with the tractor to cut our lawn.  Now I have no grass at all.
720676,smally21,2012-08-07 00:33:00,993,"im just west of hamilton in ancaster, and not going that far, just hitting the outskirts. going to a house ive had my eye on for 15 years, the sign came up and I strapped dynamite to my chest and told the guy it was going to be mine...  ive wanted/needed a shop (or two) for hobbies and outside work and this new property has two..20 acres of bush on a road not too travelled, but still within a few clicks of town.  Drifter - dont blast me with reality!! im young and dumb and think cutting lawn will be relaxing...  im a shift working guy and have a lot of time off to drive in circles over and over, kids r pumped too.  wife has given it a solid enhhh, ok."
720723,fish_fishburn,2012-08-07 03:42:00,1311,congrats...would rather be fishing then cutting grass.
