718119,snagged,2012-07-26 22:57:00,67,"first of, are bowfin the same as snakehead?  I caught one today on the lakeshore and didn't know weather to kill it or put it back.  I wasn't sure so I put it back.  I remember hearing that they are invasive and the MNR wanted us to discard them if caught.  Can anyone shed some light?  TIA"
718122,mike rousseau,2012-07-26 23:00:00,4661,Not the same
718125,kickingfrog,2012-07-26 23:39:00,8333,Lots of images on the net. Similar personalities but fairly easy to distinguish between them.  
718154,snagged,2012-07-27 01:36:00,67,Thanks for the pictures.  I definately caught a bowfin today.
718155,jedimaster,2012-07-27 01:51:00,3472,Stick your hand in its mouth. You get back more than a wrist its a bowfin.
718181,Garfisher,2012-07-27 03:02:00,229,"Bowfin's have a gular plate (which is handy for holding on to them), snakeheads don't."
718296,Millhouse2020,2012-07-27 16:29:00,152,"I did not know they were harvested for their caviar.  They are definately a primitive fish that has survived with little change for a very long time.  They can breath air, like the snakehead.  To me they closely resemble a coelacanth which a 400 million year old fish thought to be long extinct until a specimen was discovered in 1938 off the coast of south africa.  Aparantly the locals had caught them periodically for some time and thought nothing of it.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowfin   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth"
718302,aplumma,2012-07-27 17:05:00,6896,If you can get your lure out of there mouths and still have 5 fingers it is a bowfin.   Art
719797,RsX,2012-08-02 23:56:00,48,i caught a snakehead at the islands and damn the teeth on those things crazy
719801,kickingfrog,2012-08-03 00:06:00,8333, The Toronto Islands?
719842,John Bacon,2012-08-03 02:53:00,3277," Is, so, it was probably a bowfin."
720114,GYPSY400,2012-08-04 02:42:00,191,"To my knowledge, there is no snakeheads in Ontario.. Once they arrive, we are all screwed.. Those things eat everything!!"
720125,Garfisher,2012-08-04 04:19:00,229,Kinda like how the Potomac has really taken a beating from them
720153,GYPSY400,2012-08-04 14:09:00,191,  I googled Potomac since I didn't know what your referring too.. It seems as though they have a snakehead tournament and all caught fish must be killed immediately .. Well that's one way to deal with the problem!!
720165,ehg,2012-08-04 16:44:00,2666,"Ya, apparently there are no snakeheads found in Ontario. It is too cold. Lots in the Potomac around Washington, D.C. however.  Apparently they eat them where they originally exist."
720184,Snidley,2012-08-04 18:38:00,620,"They are very tasty apparently. The Potomac is not loaded with them but they are there to be caught. They actually have a decent fight to them and many anglers like catching them, except for the teeth. A nuisance for Bass anglers similar to hammer handles here."
