Headed off to algonquin where i didn't get the fishing I would have enjoyed but it's almost impossible to not have a good time up there!  We start off on bass opener on the grand in York..       Algonquin Duck      Now on to the FISH! No monster so far this summer, but some decent size!   These 2 fish were my dinner on a night that I was by myself, Yummy !     Went down the river in my kayak towards cayuga, and i was trolling a floating rapala through a weedbed when my rod dipped, Bang! a strong 3 pound smalljaw!     Went fishing with a buddy of mine and hit my grand river smallie hole and it didn't fail to produce!               My buddy even pulled out some nice eyes the last week!       As some of you may know, I recently tried to learn fly fishing. I was getting some distance on my casts when my fly rod slipped into a door crack.. end of that rod,doh! well after that I invested in a new rod and have been finally able to get some fish on the end of it! The smallies couldn't resist my wooly bugger yesterday pulling in 8 in only 3 hours ! These are my best two from the day.    Sorry for the bad pictures.. hard to get a good self picture standing in the middle of a river LOL!  WELL thats it for today, hope you enjoy the rest of your summer! tightlines!"
