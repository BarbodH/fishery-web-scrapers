I would like to do something I've never really tried; target walleye. Haven't caught one since a little dink at Fenelon Falls back in the 60s.  Also will be dropshotting for smallmouth over any rock falls, topwater largemouth near weeds, might get a few pike that way too. Totally unfamiliar with the lake, so I'm looking to decrease the amount of learning time. (Which, for me, usually lasts until the drive home   )"

I actually just got back last sunday from spending 2 weeks camping in the park. I am sure i could put you on some walleye,smallies and some very large muskies as well"
