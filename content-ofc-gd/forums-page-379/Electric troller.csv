Ive always used a tiller for trolling but found it difficult to control the boat especially if a light breeze was blowing.  I recently bought a 14' Lund with a 30 hp Suzuki.  Awesome package!  I decided to install a 55 lb bow mount electric, power drive (energy saver).  First I want to say it was very easy to install, 2nd it gives a whole new definition to boat control.  WOW I'm impressed.  I can troll approximately 20 hours on a week end & return with only half the battery charge used!  I also purchased the co pilot which is a wireless remote to control the motor.  Best piece of equipment on my boat!!"
720293,davey buoy,2012-08-05 11:50:00,5505, What a difference a bow mounted electric controls the boat compared to a rear tiller electric. Glad you like it.
720296,wormdunker,2012-08-05 11:57:00,1711,2 thumbs up for the bow mount!!  If  u r planning to purchase a bow mount I strongly advise the co pilot.  U can control the motor any where on the boat.
720481,workwear,2012-08-06 01:35:00,592,wait till you find out what the i-pilot does!!
720517,bare foot wader,2012-08-06 06:52:00,1354, do you have the ipilot? i've heard it can only read the gps from hummingbird products?
720519,wormdunker,2012-08-06 09:47:00,1711,Thanx for the heads up on the ipilot.  I thought it was rather pricey?  Is it easy to use?  I like the fact I can move around the boat & still have great control of my boat.  If using ipilot & u get snagged & have to turn around/back up how do u navigate with ipilot in this situation?
720520,Terry,2012-08-06 09:51:00,14456,"you turn off follow course and steer back manually, get unsnagged then resume course"
720533,limeyangler,2012-08-06 12:00:00,5204," TRUE!    Its so easy even i can use it! I dont even use the track system...just auto pilot (keeps you on a constant heading) and the spot lock. Spot lock alone is worth the 500 bones....its like having a guide in the boat, all you have to do is fish!"
720730,wormdunker,2012-08-07 07:11:00,1711,"sounds very good.  Have to hold off on it.  Spent too much $$ this year on fishing equipment.  New 4 wheeler in January, Humminbired ice 55, 14' Lund, Bird 798 with side & down scan (nice toy).  I figured with my expenses my fish only cost $898.00 per pound??"
