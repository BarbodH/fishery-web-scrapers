719440,wkrp,2012-08-01 18:19:00,656,Excellent! Heading there tomorrow .
719476,bigcreekdad,2012-08-01 20:27:00,546,"I'm heading up the 10th for a week, then back again second week of September. I was up in late June and fishing was off. I think you'll find bass fishing pretty good when you are going, but walleye might require some checking deeper areas.I've not been up before in August, but SEptember has usually been pretty good. My main target is muskie, but I take breaks to rest my arm throwing soft baits for bass. It might boil down to whether nights are starting to cool off the water temps a bit.  I fish below the Chaudiere dams. I have head the upper French and Nippising has been good for walleye this year. What part of the French are you going to be on?"
719486,Rich Clemens,2012-08-01 21:18:00,3131,  When you gonna be up there in Sept ?    We're at Wolseley Lodge for a week - arriving the 8th

719503,chris.brock,2012-08-01 23:31:00,4053,early September is good for muskies if that's what you're after What section of the French?

720294,wormdunker,2012-08-05 11:55:00,1711,"Fishing in Wolsely Bay I've always had good luck trolling outside the weed beds late in the evening.  I used go getters tipped with 1 1/2"" of dew worm.  Trolling in 8-12 fow has been successful for me."
