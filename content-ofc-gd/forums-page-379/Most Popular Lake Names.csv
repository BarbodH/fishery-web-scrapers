719931,rhymobot,2012-08-03 14:46:00,174,I've only fished for like 3 years now with my inflatable and so I search google maps for small enough lakes for me to try. Why are there so many lakes named Little Lake?!!! lol. What happened to originality when towns were naming these lakes way back in the day?  And why didn't they think about the future when we'd all be on the internet discussing lakes and getting confused about which one we were referring to in forum discussions?!!  Lots of Island Lakes and Mud Lakes too.  What else?
