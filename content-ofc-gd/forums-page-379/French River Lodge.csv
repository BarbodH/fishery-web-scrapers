I have never fished the area and with all the terrain I don't want to wasted time on this short trip.  I have no specific species in mind, but i do enjoy catching Walters and bass!  Thanks guy's for the help!"
719780,aplumma,2012-08-02 23:07:00,6896,Something that might help you here is ask for techniques or strategies most people will not share spots on the internet nor with someone that they have not met. This means you need to give us an idea as to what fish you want to catch and what resources you have available. A general tip for the area is fish the bay mouths and the inlets where the weed lines are still green.  Hope this helps jump start this thread.  Art

I can tell you what I used and had non stop action. Ultra light with 4lbs line very small jig head motor oil color twister tail and mustard color about 3"" long. If you have to tip them with minnows. Just cast and slow retrieve or jig them. Lots of sm bass using baby minus fire tiger and chrome/blue"
719787,solopaddler,2012-08-02 23:20:00,8605,"Well it's no huge secret...but you might want to head upstream from Ox bay and fish the pools and eddies below Flat rapids. Lots of bass and walleyes there.  Also just downstream from the rapids there's a good hole underneath the railway bridge.  For big walleyes troll at night with oversized floating Rapalas. The lodge owner should be able to point you in the right direction.  While you're there get a guide for at least one day and have him take you down the western channel to the Bad River.  You can't take the boat yourself...it's too dangerous for a first timer navigating down through the rapids.  Well worth it though. The Bad river delta is one of the most scenic spots I've ever been to, plus the fishing is great.  Enjoy your trip, it's a gorgeous part of the country."

720625,Acountdeleted,2012-08-06 20:10:00,2562,Don't fish wolsley bay area. I fished there all weekend and didn't get much. When I did though I found white spinners and drop shot minnows was what worked best.
