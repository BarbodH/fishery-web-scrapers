Muskie trip will be to Lake St. Clair with some early bass and walleye fishing followed by muskie trolling. No muskie gear necessary but bring bass/walleye gear.  Salmon trip will be Lake Ontario from Oakville harbour. No salmon gear required.  Either trip, I plan to be off the water early afternoon."
