First off saugeen smallies, my dad and I tried it out yesterday and after a long day of looking for suitable pools we finally found a honey hole. here are a few of the beasts we landed.         Today me and redpearl hit up a local lake in the canoe and we ended up getting 5 of these guys and losing many others.              And finally the question, we will be heading to algonquin on booth lake for 3 days starting thursday, trout and bass will be the targets and I was wondering what techniques you guys use for that area in the hot summer. Thanks, Tight lines!"
720661,northernpike56,2012-08-06 23:41:00,717,"nice fish!  As for techniques, I'd try a wolf river rig (three way rig) if you are trolling for speckles in a lake. Tie a 6 lb fluoro leader off the swivel and attach whatever lure you want to troll (mepps, rapala, etc). Use a 1-2 oz. bell sinker to tie off the other swivel to get the lure running down deep."

720720,woodenboater,2012-08-07 02:55:00,2277,Always liked floating or countdown Rapalas on ultralight gear for Algonquin bass.
720763,Christopheraaron,2012-08-07 14:34:00,3525,Thanks wb you've really helped me out this year.
720767,Broker,2012-08-07 14:53:00,482,"Use the 3 way rig most of the time for brooks, but sometimes , if you hit the shallows at dusk, they might be munching on the baitfish they chased in. Good luck, also reccomend you bring your fly gear as there is some streams rivers which hold trout, and the bass would be fun on it too !"
720787,Ainsley,2012-08-07 16:11:00,142,My first Algonquin trip was to Booth lake. We stayed on the island in the West end of the lake. Caught quite a few bass along the shore there. This was before I started targeting trout up there so I don't know how they are in booth Good luck!
