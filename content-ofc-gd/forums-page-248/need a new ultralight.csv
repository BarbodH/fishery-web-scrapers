844422,l2p,2014-03-30 16:51:00,346,"Maybe worth checking one of these out. Picked up a 7ft UL years ago for 40 bucks, hard to beat for the money.  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Micro-Lite-Graphite-Spinning-Rods/product/10204875/"
844423,NANUK,2014-03-30 16:59:00,797,"Check out Rapala F2 ultralight rods, nice crisp action, 4 models to choose from,"
844425,Hooked,2014-03-30 17:06:00,891,I picked up a St. Croix Panfish series rod last year.  6' UL paired with a Rapala R-Type spinning reel.  Awesome rod I have to admit.
844455,dave524,2014-03-30 19:24:00,4508,"Don't go really noodly on the rod, perch on Erie are frequently in 40 feet of water , 1/2 oz. sinker and long hooksets are better with a stiffer action .  edit: the ultra lite I use on small creek trout is not the one I use on Erie perch."

My Erie perch rod is an ancient 5 1/4 foot one piece, Fenwick HMG, very light but rated for 1/4 to 5/8oz wts. paired up with an ultralite reel and braid , I find it ideal."
