842625,Big Cliff,2014-03-22 15:32:00,6899,"If there is any way you can afford buying new then do it. I have seen so many ""used"" machines that looked good and seemed to run well but that had serious issues with them! Unless you really know the history of a used machine be very careful!"
843124,ch312,2014-03-24 18:57:00,1590,"Ya, you gotta look hard if buying used and you rarely get to test it out properly; finding out all the bad stuff long after you bought it.  Still, I'm not ruling anything out at this point.  Inspecting an ATV is 10x easier than checking out a car or truck, yet most people I know will choose a lightly used automobile over new without knowing the full history of the vehicle as the savings are huge. It's also far easier to tell how an ATV has been maintained and ridden.   - Not many people have collision on their ATV's meaning most chalk up bent or broken plastics and bumpers from hard riding as battle wounds because these parts are often too expensive to justify replacing them and insurance won't cover them.  - It'll be very clear if the machine was used for hardcore mudding or racing. Does it have snorks, rad relocate, or big aggressive tires? What about clutch or engine mods? More importantly, do any of the parts associated with these mods look out of place or too new for the machine? This would suggest the ATV was rode hard and the seller knows there is something wrong with it and has returned it back to stock to try and dump it.  - How old is the seller? Older people typically take better care of their equipment and take it easy while riding.  - Refusing to let you test drive and do a complete inspection means they have something to hide. Walk away.   It's relatively easy to take the plastics and wheels off an ATV to do a complete inspection. In less than an hour you can easily inspect the electrical, clutch, frame, suspension, drive train, engine, etc saving you thousands of dollars over new. Plus, many used machines will come with accessories that can add up very quickly.    Experienced with ATV's and their maintenance, decent mechanical ability, or know a good ATV mechanic...definitely buy used. All others...buy new."
843128,ch312,2014-03-24 19:16:00,1590,"More like a skinny chimpanzee, but I""m young enough ..for now.  It's too bad I can't really test drive an ATV. I've never used EPS before and I'd like to try it out... oh well, maybe I'll spring for it anyway.   It's not really about your strength or age as even the fittest young man will feel the effects of driving in 4x4 all day, cruising over very rough terrain for prolonged periods, or having their arms jerked back and fourth from the kickback on non EPS machines. EPS makes the ride far more easier, safer, and enjoyable for everyone and you'll feel the difference at the end of the day. Honestly, I highly doubt you'll find anyone who has drove an ATV with power steering and didn't think it was a huge imporvement over the same machine without EPS."
843190,Rod Caster,2014-03-24 23:05:00,5784,"Thanks ch312. Great advice all around.  I've decided to by a used ATV and have enough $ left over for kick-ass trailer.  I'm looking at one more machine this week. But it's looking like:  ATV: Suzuki Quadmaster 500. $2900 including new tires and new battery. Around $3,400 including tax and admin. 5,500kms.  Trailer: T-Rex Trailer. $1,825 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp3gl8SB7T0"
843192,mcdougy,2014-03-24 23:08:00,274,What year? From a dealer?
843194,Fisherman,2014-03-24 23:14:00,7201," Trailer: T-Rex Trailer. $1,825 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp3gl8SB7T0 I bet you played with a tonka dumptruck when you were a kid last week eh?   Not a bad price."
843298,Rod Caster,2014-03-25 12:54:00,5784,"What year? From a dealer? 2001. Yes, a dealer. The book value is around $3,200. Including the tires and tune up I'm going to request, I think it's a decent price.  ATV buying on Kijiji is a pain in the butt, and you still have to pay taxes at the MTO anyway; rarely is there a great deal on Kijiji unless you get super lucky/timing is right.  haha about the Tonka! Yes, I played tonka and dinky cars in the sandbox for many years haha."
843303,Renegade67,2014-03-25 13:23:00,86,"Hopefully this quad will provide years of enjoyment for you.   I've had good experiences with suzuki.  One of the best starting machines in cold weather. If he is a good dealer he will go through the machine for you and make you aware of anything he finds that needs attention.   A tune up most likely will be an oil change, new oil filter, fuel filter, plug and inspect/replace the drive belt.  Will he take the clutches off and service them?  There are pins, rollers, bushings, weights, springs that all wear in there as well.... As I mentioned previously if the machine needs tires then...... I apologize if I'm coming off poorly, I just trying to make you more informed!"
843367,Rod Caster,2014-03-25 17:23:00,5784,Its a 14 year old machine so it was time for the stock tires to be changed out. I could easily get another year or more outta the old tires
843545,mcdougy,2014-03-26 01:37:00,274," CONGRATS, ATVs are one handy tool to have and some fun also.   Couple things to look over before you pass over the cash IMO.  Jack the front end, put in 4 wheel drive and neutral and spin each of the front tires.  That should tell you if 4 wheel drive is working.   Take a real close look at the cv boots in the front ,and if there are some , in the back. A hole in them is a bad thing. Give them a slight squeeze to feel for grease in the boot.  Try the pull start or kick start, make sure it works. The rope could be rotten if the bike has seen much water, and auxillary start can be a big saviour in bad situations, like a dead battery. Take it for a good long test drive and put it through its paces. Make sure the rad is working well. This can take a while to get it to kick on,especially in this weather. But you want to know it works. Listen carefully for any sort of grinding while the gears are changing. Especially in the lower gears. Grinding is bad, and after a quick read about this model did read a few problems with the grinding in the transmission. All bikes and models have problems,this sounded like this models weak spot,  not trying to spook you. After the good long ride, ask if you can pull a little oil out of it. check the drain plug for any metal stuck to magnet, or really odd colour or smell to oil. Since your going through a dealer, which I think is a good thing. Don'T be shy, ask for a 150km warranty or something, it's still a bunch of cash and not worth walking away with no guarantee this thing is not ready to pop. A good dealer will do that and put it in writing for you. It's peace of mind that they have checked it out somewhat.  Cheers and have fun being safe."
843647,ch312,2014-03-26 16:29:00,1590,"Its a 14 year old machine so it was time for the stock tires to be changed out. I could easily get another year or more outta the old tires  Tires are the best upgrade for an ATV and stock tires on most machines are absolutely horrible for mud and trail riding. But, they usually do great in the snow because they aren't aggressive and will not dig down in the snow like aggressive mud tires will. A good all around tire that is relatively light and inexpensive is the ITP mud lite. Zilla's are better in terms of traction, but they dig in the snow more and have weak sidewalls and minimal bead protection.  I use ITP mud lite XTR radials, but they're too heavy and rob too much power for a stock 500. They wear like iron and the strong sidewalls and bead area's make it possible to continue riding on a completely flat tire while with most tires this isn't possible because the bead will break lose or rim damage will occur because the weak sidewalls cannot support the weight of the machine when the tire is flat.   I have zero experience with this machine, but you can message me if you want some tips on inspecting the machine before you buy it.   What other machine are you considering?"
843667,Rod Caster,2014-03-26 18:32:00,5784,"I was considering a 2011 king quad 500 , 2013 Yamaha Kodiak 450 and a 2006-2008 Honda Foreman.  I just put my deposit on the Quadmaster. The more I look around and do research, the more it looks like a fair deal....everything works on the quad so it's a great sign that the old owner took care of it. There isn't a drop of oil on any of the parts and barely any visible rust. The oil (which was not changed by the dealer) looks normal too. If I find it's not suitable for my type of usage I could easily sell it for the same price I paid.  the dealer threw in a 15 day warranty; so I'll run it hard and see if there are any things I've missed during the buying process.  I went to the suzuki dealer and asked them about the machine, they also vouched for it's quality...that 500 engine has been used in a lot of machines including most arctic cat's of that time. It's a reliable engine described as bulletproof.  Now it's time to get that trailer!"
843685,lew,2014-03-26 20:25:00,12766,"If anyones interested, I saw an ATV for sale today sitting in a driveway on the west side of hwy 28 between Lakefield & Youngs Point...(10 miles north of Peterboro)  Only thing I can tell you is it's a dark colour and has a gun case strapped to the handle bars."
843703,sneak_e_pete,2014-03-26 21:17:00,540,Congrats on your ride!
842305,ch312,2014-03-20 17:07:00,1590,"Well, you may be right but I have never had to tow a Polaris out of the bush. I have never had to be towed out of the bush ( in 14 years) ! I have had to tow more than one Yamaha (and a few other makes)out of the bush with my Polaris. Oh, and now you know at least one guy that traded his Polaris for a newer Polaris and has no regrets what so ever.  My machines are WORK machines but I also trail ride with them, use them for ice fishing, hunting...... I do most of the regular maintainance on them myself so maybe that is the reason I have such good luck on them.  I didn't say you'll never find a happy Polaris owner, I said it's rare to find one  The guys who maintain their Polaris' regularly still have plenty of issues due to poor quality builds, even on machines that are only a year or two old.  You really get to see how machines hold up on the long 50-75 km runs which typically consist of 1/3 field running up to 100 km/h, 1/3 trails/regular mudding, and 1/3 ""this is stupid, why are we doing this"" mudding, hill climbing, and water running. By the end of these 12-14 hour+ days there are always machines getting towed back and literally every time the majority are Polaris' and Cat's. They simply can't handle the beating our style of riding puts on them.   If anyone in the Brantford area wants to have some fun this year send me a pm and we'll get together for a ride or two. We typically ride on the reserve where there's tons of trails and the police don't care if you ride on the roads. There's a poker run next month which usually has 100 ATV's..."
842333,Rod Caster,2014-03-20 18:22:00,5784,"Ok, so I'll present it like this.  What would you choose if the following facts are true: Polaris 400 for $6,600 out the door  Or  Yamaha Kodiak 450 non-p/sfor $8,300 out the door"
842345,porkpie,2014-03-20 18:53:00,2521,"I would take the yamaha every time.  If I didn't have the extra scratch, I'd wait or I would look for a few year old model and buy used.  I bought mine with under 800km in mint condition for significantly less dollars than a new machine, and for all intents and purposes it was barely broken in."
842346,Fisherman,2014-03-20 18:55:00,7201,"Yamaha Kodiak without thinking.  We have two at work that are bush and trail ridden in the warmer months, all winter they are used for parking lot plowing.  The winter plowing is not nice on them, there's a bunch of numpties at work that could break cement eggs given enough time, but they are still running,  one has close to 10,000, the other around 7000 with minimal maintenance, twice a year oil changes and check the brakes.  You get what you pay for, and you don't get much when you cheap out,  it tends to add up at the other end in the maintenance shop"
842351,misfish,2014-03-20 19:29:00,29133,I got permission to show you this beast.  On my wish list.  
842353,porkpie,2014-03-20 19:33:00,2521,"That old adage took me a long time to learn, but I agree wholeheartedly.  Put in simpler terms, it's $1700.  Amortize that over 10 years and it's peanuts.  In 10 years the Polaris will probably be long since sold, but I would put money on the Yamaha being fit for another 10 years of service.  The oldest honda at my camp is 28 years old this season.  The oldest Yamaha at least 20.  We still use them every year, and they require very little maintenance.  The honda has literally been beat half to death, and still keeps ticking along.  In all things, you get what you pay for!  Anyway, I won't harp on your thread anymore.  Good luck with whatever you go with!"
842362,Rod Caster,2014-03-20 20:43:00,5784,Im definitely leaning towards yamaha. I'll probably put half down and 3yr finance the remainder. I'm getting tired of repairs on my older machines; I'd love to own an ATV for 20 years with minimal maintenance.  Great input everyone
842417,Rod Caster,2014-03-20 23:58:00,5784,"Anybody have experience with the Suzuki KingQuad 400? They are more closely priced to the Polaris' but have a good reliability reputation, seemingly on par with Honda/Yamaha"

842458,wormdunker,2014-03-21 09:32:00,1711,"I have a 2012 Polaris 500 used primarily for ice fishing.  Price was $6500.00 including a 3,000 lb winch, add tax 7500.00 out the door.  At the time of purchase I could not justify $10,000 plus tax for a 650 Can Am.  As stated by the above posts, I guess it's all in how much heavy duty work you are going to inflict on your machine.  I'm an older gentle rider so I didn't see the need to spend the extra $$$.  So far my bike has zero issues.  With the extra money saved on the Polaris I was able to purchase important stuff like new rods, reels, an ice flasher & beer!"

842514,ch312,2014-03-21 17:39:00,1590,"Ok, so I'll present it like this.  What would you choose if the following facts are true: Polaris 400 for $6,600 out the door  Or  Yamaha Kodiak 450 non-p/sfor $8,300 out the door  I would choose a new Kodiak from the US or a lightly used local machine. I looked into importing a 700 and after everything was said and done I would have saved $2500 buying a new machine from the US. A Kodiak costs less, but I'd still think you could save $1500 or more.  In 2009 I bought my 07 Grizzly 700 with power steering, low km's, two sets of good tires, warn winch, plow, rear storage box, and independent 5 year warranty for $8,500 when local dealers were selling just the base machine for $11,000 out the door so it would have been over $13,000 new with everything I have. As with automobiles, you'll save a ton of money buying used over new.  It's much easier to tell how an ATV has been used and maintained when compared to trucks and cars. If you happen to find a used machine in my area that you're interested in I will check it out for you before you make the long drive to pick it up.    Have you used a machine with power steering? Literally every single person I've spoken too who have it wouldn't buy a machine without it. Yes, it makes that much of a difference! With EPS you can have it in 4x4 and drive one handed through holes and very rough terrain where those on non EPS machines are forced to use two hands or risk losing control. I've rode a ton of machines with and without EPS and the non EPS machines will always wear you out much quicker no matter how old or fit you are. You'll experience far less fatigue, much less kickback (when your front tires hit rocks, logs, etc), and just have an overall better experience."

Great ride and lots of power. I took that machine all over and beat it like it owed me money and it still kept going.  After a few years with no issues, I sold it as I wanted a side x side to get me to the backwoods fishing holes. I got a Yamaha Rhino 450. Double Wow! Amazing machine. If the Kodiak has the same engine I would give it a thumbs up. That engine never quit. I had it 4 years and no problems."

The guy I bought from gave a short warranty. He is still going strong. He is buying the bikes from the u.s. mainly and the cost reflects. I was able to haggle the taxes included in his asking price since he is a ""dealer"", I believe I worked in the license fee also.  Check his site out. ""Wild bills rv and atv""   It might be worth the drive to get a almost new bike with a few more options and cc's then you are pricing new.

842614,Renegade67,2014-03-22 13:16:00,86,I have my doubts with finding a used machine that will serve you well  and save you much after you go through it to bring it back to spec..  There are two problems with finding a good atv used.   The biggest being there is no real down season and for some reason most ppl think they are made of gold and don't depreciate.  Look through auto trader or kijiji.  Bikes that are 5-10 years old and they are asking over 4000 for?   Most ppl just ride them till they break and only fix what broken.   It may look clean but when you get it home and tear it down you learn the truth and it will be too late.  A good indicator is worn out tires.  If they did not replace them what else didn't they maintain?

The Honda Fourman 420 would be top of my list, but it's about $7,800 unless you can find the end-of-year models in the fall. I need one this summer so I won't wait.  The Polaris Sportsman 450 is $5,600 right now and is my second choice. I've always trusted Polaris products and I'm pretty sure the resale on all ATV's is strong. I also trust the mechanics at my local dealership. Plus they are offering an extra 6months of warranty until April.  Haven't really looked at Yamaha, Suzuki or Arctic Cat, but I know that the cheapest of these is Arctic Cat and to be honest I don't have faith in AC.

842073,ch312,2014-03-19 19:13:00,1590,"Hey there feedbackers.  I'll be picking up a new ATV this spring for working on my property. I'm looking at entry-level models like 400's and 450's.  The Honda Fourman 420 would be top of my list, but it's about $7,800 unless you can find the end-of-year models in the fall. I need one this summer so I won't wait.  The Polaris Sportsman 450 is $5,600 right now and is my second choice. I've always trusted Polaris products and I'm pretty sure the resale on all ATV's is strong. I also trust the mechanics at my local dealership. Plus they are offering an extra 6months of warranty until April.  Haven't really looked at Yamaha, Suzuki or Arctic Cat, but I know that the cheapest of these is Arctic Cat and to be honest I don't have faith in AC.  Any opinions on the entry level models accross the board?  Stick with Honda, Yamaha, Kawisaki, or Suzuki.  I've logged over 5,000 kms in the last 3 years with 75-80 km runs being a normal thing for our group with a couple poker runs each year having over 100 ATV's participating in the 40-50 km runs. I can assure you that Polaris ATV's should never be trusted. Among the hundreds of riders I've met it's rare to find someone who has sold their Polaris and buy another one because they quickly learn why Polaris has such a bad reputation in the ATV world. Polaris ATV's are almost always the first machines (if it's not the Cat's first!) to break down. Mainly electrical and drive train issues.  The lower quality ATV's are fine for putting around the farm where even crappy ATV's from China will keep ticking for a while, but the true quality of the machines are tested when you put them through hell on long rides all year round.  I'm a Yamaha guy so I say go for a Yamaha Kodiak 450 with power steering. They may cost a bit more upfront, but the low maintenance and high reliability is definitely worth it. This machine is better than the Honda and Polaris machines you're considering for a couple major reasons...   Kodiak - Independent rear suspension, 10.8"" of ground clearance. Much easier to ride due to clearance, much more comfortable ride. Honda - Solid rear axle, 6.5"" ground clearance. Horrible ground clearance, your back will hate you after long rides due to the harsh ride.  Kodiak - 607 lbs wet weight, separate front/rear brakes, 78"" long, 43"" wide, steel racks. Better power to weight ratio, better control, much more nimble. Polaris - 715 lbs dry (750 wet?), one lever controls all, 83"" long, 48"" wide, plastic racks. Much lighter, poor braking system, too large."
842076,Rod Caster,2014-03-19 19:43:00,5784,"Thanks, I just called the Yammy dealer  for pricing details. $7,399 for a non-power steering 450 Kodiak plus a bit of room to negociate. I'll test one out next week.  My father in law has a Polaris and worked the heck out of it on his property for 12 years, no actual riding. He's been very happy with it."

842092,captpierre,2014-03-19 20:52:00,2521,"Went thru the same process last few years and hate to part with cash.  After much help from guys on this site, went with Honda  PGE 420 Canadian Trail Edition  You need to sort out if you want :  Power steering Independent rear suspension Fuel injection CVT or not.  All are CVT except Honda Single, 2UP, or side by side  Over and over again I heard from experienced guys that the Japanese machines are more reliable.  Almost everybody says go with power steering and fuel injection.  For trail riding, independent rear suspension will give you more ground clearance and a smoother ride  For towing or other farm work, most guys prefer a solid rear axle  Side by sides and even 2UPs are not legal on any roads, even with no passengers  I saw in a recent outdoor magazine that Honda still has their $1000 off for some 2013 models  My other choice would have been Yammy.  The 450 with power steering -but doesn't come with fuel injection  The Yammy 550 EPS has it all but is around $10K.  My Honda was $8100 in camo plus HST including rebate  The last thing you want is a stupid breakdown in the middle of no-where.  Then an expensive repair bill on top.  So far so good with the Honda but hardly broken in.  Talk to me in 5 yrs"

I have had to tow more than one Yamaha (and a few other makes)out of the bush with my Polaris. Oh, and now you know at least one guy that traded his Polaris for a newer Polaris and has no regrets what so ever.  My machines are WORK machines but I also trail ride with them, use them for ice fishing, hunting...... I do most of the regular maintainance on them myself so maybe that is the reason I have such good luck on them."
842103,Muskieman,2014-03-19 21:32:00,2472,"go see Eric at ASM , they usually have the KVF 360 4x4 or the Cat 400 4x4 on sale every spring for about 4200.00$..."

842110,Rod Caster,2014-03-19 22:30:00,5784,"For the price and comfort and general layout, the Polaris is clearly the best deal ($5,600). I talked the Yammy dealer down to $7,000  for the non-power steering Kodiak 450. Financing is better there too, 3.49% for 36mths or 2.99% for 24 mths.  The Kodiak seems to be more rugged, has good clearance and has true 4x4. The Polaris isn't true 4x4 and that's a let down. I'd also bet the Yammy's generally have better reliability stats.  I'm not liking any Arctic Cat, Kawasawki or Can-Am's for work machines. I'll check out Suzuki next chance I get.  If Honda had 2013's in stock, for $6,800, I'd probably call it a deal, even though the Polaris and Yamaha seem better to handle really rough terrain."
842117,Fisherman,2014-03-19 23:10:00,7201,"Well, you may be right but I have never had to tow a Polaris out of the bush. you're right, most light them on fire and leave them there.."
842143,SBCregal,2014-03-20 00:07:00,688,"I have a 14 yr old  yamaha kodiak 400 that I bought used last summer.  While I don't know the mileage on it as the speedo/odo isn't working anymore you can tell it hasn't been babied over the years.  It still runs great, starts first pull (when I don't remember to turn the key off), 4x4 works etc.  It's my first atv of my own but I've ridden some polaris and honda machines, when it gets replaced it will be with another yamaha.  Ryan"
842153,porkpie,2014-03-20 00:39:00,2521,"Polaris are a good deal cause they are cheap.  Which works out to be not such a good deal for longevity.  For every satisfied Polaris owner I've run across, I've met with a pile of dissatisfied ones.  Every single one that we've had come into our hunt camp has crapped out at one point or another.  There is only 1 left, it's a 2007.   It has been regularily maintained, but it has failed at least once between Mose and deer weeks for the last 3 seasons.  All of the rest of us have Hondas or yamahas.  My guest bike is an old kawi that runs pretty good, but my daily driver is a yamaha.  I once bought an arctic cat, and it too was a hunk of crap!  Another guy at my camp also had 2 cats, and they where dung heaps too!  All of our machines get beat on pretty hard, as we hunt, run trails, drag wood out of the bush, clears trails etc. all year long.  Polaris are cheap for a reason.  Glad to hear your looking at yamaha.  That and honda are the only real choices in my mind!"
842154,4x4bassin,2014-03-20 00:40:00,1025,"Yamaha , Suzuki and Honda would be my choices . Own suzuki's now with a lot of hard miles on them with no problems !"
842164,purekgw,2014-03-20 01:05:00,585,"i my self just picked up a brand new yamaha 700 after weeks of looking, was only really two choices yamaha or honda. and i am more then happy with the choice."
842186,limeyangler,2014-03-20 02:07:00,5204,"I don't own an ATV, and have only ridden one a couple of times, however, just about everyone up here (except me) owns one. When asking around to get an idea of the one i want to eventually buy i am left with the conclusion that Yamaha and Honda are the brands to go with. My buddy who is an out and out SLEDNECK/MUDDING/MECHANIC loves his arctic cat sleds so i was very surprised the other day when we were pulling the shack off the lake to hear him say the Arctic cat ATVs are junk, he wants a Can-am next.  So from 7 years of asking the same question you are in this thread i would be looking at YAMAHA, HONDA, CAN-AM if i had the money to go out and get a bike."
842269,vance,2014-03-20 15:10:00,719,"From my experience the ATV owners who are proactive about maintenance have the least problems on the trails !!  I have a 2011 Suzuki 500 fuel injected,in 2 years I have put 7,000 km of trail riding on it and the guy I ride the most with has 16,000 on his 97 Suzuki. We ALWAYS go over the bikes and check out the drive train after every ride.Last year I towed 3 bikes home when they broke down all because of the lack of maintenance,the worse was the guy with the broken drive shaft yoke and when he took it in to get fixed found out that EVERY CV joint was also worn out and he needed front bearings.You can't have a drive it and park it mentality with ATVs.As far as makes go there is not a lot of difference between them they all have faults and pluses and I bought mine based on the dealer not the make,good service goes a long way!!!!  vance"
