842069,Paulus,2014-03-19 18:40:00,522,"Well, we're nearing that time of year where maybe - just maybe - Spring might perhaps kind of slowly start & we there might actually be some open water for us steelhead afficionados.  Speaking of afficionados, does anyone else here appreciate ""schmokin a schtoggie"" when fishing, steelhead or otherwise?  Share your pics if you got'em!    Stoggie + MO-stache + steelhead. Gotta love it!    Bent-rod stoggie...    Soon, very soon. In the meantime, stay schmokie, my friends.  p.-"

842318,Paulus,2014-03-20 17:37:00,522,"Always got a cigar or chew with me while fishing.... don't see a band on that one... what do you smoke usually?  I usually take the ring off before I light one, just because I usually go right down to the nub. I usually get Flor de Oliva torpedos - but these are Nestor Miranda seconds, gordos. Still trying to figure out why they're seconds, because I've only had one that didn't burn evenly. Otherwise.... like cold beer on a hot day... they're so good!  I cruise atlanticcigars.com and cigarplace.biz for the best deals  p.-"
842486,quickme,2014-03-21 13:56:00,261,love having a stick while on the water.  Really digging the H.Upmann Half Coronas right now but I'll be switching up to some longer sticks when it warms up.  Atlantic cigars is great.  They price match if you ever see a better deal
842897,tender52,2014-03-23 16:31:00,270,I like my Romeo and Juliett's on the water. Stopped smoking cigaretts for 5-6 years now. Still need that stogie on the big trip

Looks like the warmer weather's just around the corner.... time to get out there and light one (or two) up!    p.-
843672,Loadman,2014-03-26 18:45:00,63,I have been on the Romeo kick myself.... the Dominican ones are the ones I have been smoking... Alec Bradley is another I have been trying... Montecristo #2 still my fav every day smoke... feel like one right now.... lol
843762,gordy28,2014-03-27 00:06:00,638,"3 out of the 4 guys from our fishing trip group love cigars (and scotch) Big hit on our last trip was having each guy bring his choice of a cigar paired with his choice of a single malt.  Was great and will now be a tradition We smoked Bolivar royal Coronas, monte #2s and Vegas Robaina Famosas Also love my non cubans in no order: Oliva Series V Padron anniversaires Rocky Patel Romeo (black band) Most Fuentes Tatuaje  To name a few. On Balsam lake love a good walleye drift or troll with a strong dark coffee and a stogie Cheers Gordy"

843899,aplumma,2014-03-27 21:14:00,6896,I tried the colts up North that is the nastiest stick I have ever thrown away lol. There are a large amount of good $2.00 cigars to huff on. I use a website called http://www.cigarauctioneer.com/ it may ship up North if they do they are a goldmine of great deals. The selection is broad and in the off times such as mid day and late at night the bids are usually not bumped up.   Art
