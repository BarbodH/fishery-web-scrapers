844258,misfish,2014-03-29 19:42:00,29133," She's right, you should be letting those fish go anyhow.  Stop preaching Bill.LOL"
844387,DOS,2014-03-30 11:32:00,119,"I have heard of this rock throwing lady from a few people, Has anybody tried to have her charged with interfering with your right to hunt or fish unmolested?  I might have the CO's # on my phone just in case,   naaa, like others said,  move on,  good hole just around the bend...  DAN"
843966,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-28 13:32:00,826,"Has anyone heard parts of this river may be reclassified as private ?  Restricting boat traffic ( canoes, drift boats etc..).  A few friends were telling me about it last night.  We drift the river regularly and I'm hoping this is not the case . Plan on stopping by the Town offices toady. Thanks R"
843970,BillM,2014-03-28 13:46:00,17367,"They've heard wrong.   There's only a very select few rivers in this province where landowners have streambed rights, the Notty isn't one of them and never will be."
843984,kickingfrog,2014-03-28 15:16:00,8333,The N.V.C.A. plays fast a loose with the law.
843985,kickingfrog,2014-03-28 15:17:00,8333,And Essa Township.
843989,BillM,2014-03-28 15:34:00,17367,And Essa Township.  Essa Township are probably the biggest sponsers of the Nottawasaga Steelheaders.   Food for thought
843990,misfish,2014-03-28 15:35:00,29133,"Essa township. The only one that posts signs pay to fish,but walking your dog and letting him crap is free.  HAHAHAHAHAHA"
843996,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-28 16:07:00,826,"Just found where the info came from , was in our local paper yesterday."
844000,BillM,2014-03-28 16:12:00,17367,"Just found where the info came from , was in our local paper yesterday.  It doesn't include streambed rights   Won't be different then drifting through any other private water on that river (which as you know there is a lot of)"
844001,Christopheraaron,2014-03-28 16:22:00,3525,"Even if there were streambead rights granted, could you not still float over the bed legally?"
844002,BillM,2014-03-28 16:31:00,17367,"Even if there were streambead rights granted, could you not still float over the bed legally?  Absolutely, but there haven't been streambed rights granted since like 1904, lol.   And now, if you happen to have streambed rights and you sell your property, those rights go back to the crown.  The only river I know of that has any sort of streambed rights that I've fished is the Rocky Saugeen."
844016,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-28 17:26:00,826,Ohhhhhh the wars from angry landowners our boats have seen lol. Thanks for the info !
844020,BillM,2014-03-28 18:02:00,17367,Ohhhhhh the wars from angry landowners our boats have seen lol. Thanks for the info !  I find the ones on the Notty ok (except for crazy chainsaw lady) Bighead is a completely different story
844037,wallacio,2014-03-28 19:55:00,475, I find the ones on the Notty ok (except for crazy chainsaw lady) Bighead is a completely different story Indeed.   Thankfully I didn't have to remove any bird shot from my hide that day.
844050,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-28 21:32:00,826,I keep hearing of a chainsaw lady lol  . We've had zero issues on the biggy . Lucky I guess . Jump shooting ducks on the Notty is where we have the most issues .  Birdshot coming my way ......... I'd lose my mind .
844051,misfish,2014-03-28 21:35:00,29133,"Maybe it,s the same lady that throws rocks at anglers. I heard she has called the OPP many times. She was charged and they ignore her calls now. Im looking forward to a float down the river this year. Just need to get a few guys together so we can have a drop off and pick up."

844055,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-28 21:48:00,826,Ahhh the rock thrower !!!!! Her I know lol
844057,wallacio,2014-03-28 21:50:00,475,We weren't actually shot at however this nut did fire off a shotgun into the air after we told him to leave us alone since we were not standing on his property.    I placed a call to the Meaford OPP and they paid this clown a visit immediately.
844089,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-29 00:05:00,826,Rightfully so!!!!!  Yikes

844123,BowSlayer101,2014-03-29 03:17:00,296,"lol, i let most of them go, but keep one to eat every ounce in a while, especially if they're from the g-bay tribs and are small, anyways, thats not the point, she had no right to be telling me what to do, i can keep a fish if i want, I'm under my possession limit and i don't keep rainbows all that often. I was just pi$$ed at the lady for telling me what to do, didn't care much for releasing the fish, i can get another if i want to."
