844156,lew,2014-03-29 12:54:00,12766,"I made my own Drew with  all the components bought at Home Depot.  Stainless wire cable, snaps, crimps and heat shrink."
844159,Moosebunk,2014-03-29 12:57:00,3970,I'll be doing some up then for sure Lew.  Find enjoyment in making anything fishing related versus buying at higher prices.
614346,F_ast,2011-08-22 14:33:00,154,"Hey guys,  Can anyone shoot me a pic of 2 of the sport trak brackets?  I cant beleive how expensive there things are and looking to make a few myself.  One thing I am not use on (as I have never actually seen one on a boat before) is how they attach.  I see from pics that they are a T shape to fit in the track, but how do they fit in and how do they stay in place?  I might end up with Lund brackets eventually, but how well do they hold up? any breakage issues?  Can they take ""muskie weight"" rod holders?  Thanks"
614395,SlowPoke,2011-08-22 15:59:00,2984,"I don't have them myslef but from memory, it's two L shaped that form the T and the accessory slides onto the base of the T. I have seen two break under dipsy loads. Use a teather system if you like your gear."
614417,Roy,2011-08-22 16:38:00,13728,Another option is to look at Trojan Tackle products. Marc Thorpe uses them and I don't know anyone who puts that many hours on them and lands that many large muskies in a year.  http://www.trojantackle.ca/
614425,Dan668,2011-08-22 17:02:00,1120,"I just bought mine, expensive up here, 40 bucks. Three rivers marine (I think) sell a knock off for 20 in the states"
614439,irishfield,2011-08-22 17:53:00,26272,"I use them to hold my portable radio... swinging cup holders and the very odd time for a rod holder to hold a still rod pickeral fishing with bait. Would I troll with them, or any plastic rod holder.. not with my $1000 rod/reel combos.  I highly suggest mounting some Bert or Traxstech http://www.traxstech.com/ channels and enjoying the endless possibilities with holders/mounts/rigger bases etc."
614523,misfish,2011-08-22 21:03:00,29133, Been awhile since I have used them. They do work though.
614824,ottawaguy,2011-08-23 18:33:00,11,"I would not trust the lund sport track brackets with my muskie gear either, I did once, not again.  The bottom plastic part that makes the tee broke while trolling with a small bait once, I was able to grab the rod before it went over.  I now use traxtech ( http://www.traxstech.com/T-Bolt_Bracket.html ) with a Folbe rod holder ( http://www.folbe.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2&products_id=51 ) .  I use the rod holders on 12 inch trax and a manual downrigger on a 18 inch one.  The boat I am using is a Lund 1625 rebel xl  ss.  If you have any questions let me know."
788752,Terry,2013-05-28 00:34:00,14456,"so has anyone found anything better I don't want to drill holes in my lund, so I thought Traxstech with the 45 deg t bracket but they have none in stock http://www.traxstech.com/T-Bolt_Bracket.html  so I am looking at other systems that will work with sport track"
788772,Moosebunk,2013-05-28 01:39:00,3970,"Just drill the holes Terry.  Make that tub yer own.  Sport Trak ain't all that bad for the light stuff.  Their weakness is found if and when someone grabs, reefs or leans on one at a certain angle.  Snap!"
788776,Terry,2013-05-28 01:44:00,14456,dang that is not what I wanted to hear  they use a lot of t brackets for support    
788777,Moosebunk,2013-05-28 01:53:00,3970,"Well, that'd be an option with the plastic Lund brackets then too Terry.  Use two or three to mount one track on and then slide and lock all three down.  But again, even loading a few rods in holders off of that, I'd still be leary in the end.  I just drilled for Scottys as the mounts are small and stay under the cover.  You'll like this one of Andy flippin me off. lol.  And, you can see what the brackets are actually getting used for. lol.  "
788780,BillM,2013-05-28 02:02:00,17367,"I run dipsy setups off plastic Scotty holders.  If a hot 30lb king can't rip them off, nothing will."
788781,Moosebunk,2013-05-28 02:04:00,3970, Or just catching bottom while trolling 5mph and the drags set to a two hand pull.  Them Scottys will bend backwards before breaking. lol.
788788,BFSC Kevin,2013-05-28 03:06:00,1351,"These cisco mounts are what I am considering of putting on my Lund. http://www.ciscofishingsystemsltd.com/shop/lund-mounts-5239  I am right now using the sport track mounts with Scotty powerlock rod holders, fishing for salmon. I have not yet experience any issue with the track mount or rod holder, yet... I do however notice some flex in the rod holder from the stress of pulling dipsy divers so I do tether my gear."
788808,mike rousseau,2013-05-28 06:25:00,4661,"Some musky guys run with really tight drags... My buddy had a Scotty ripped off his boat... Turns out his rod floated..., picked it up... 51"" musky still on..."

788888,doubleheader,2013-05-28 17:01:00,497,"I added the Cisco mounts this year. two mounts are required with a 12"" track. I use mine to support rod trees, but you can also buy a mount from Cisco that allows you to attach the Down East rod holder for trolling big musky baits.  I also have the Lund brackets which are fine I suppose for most applications, I haven't broke one yet anyhow. I really like the Cisco system, it attaches in seconds and is easy to move. Also pictured are Traxtech rod trees which are great for running planer boards or just increasing your spread using long rods. . "
843702,moosehead,2014-03-26 21:14:00,90,any place carry the cisco mounts in Canada or have to order from the states?

X2  I use my Lund brackets with Scotty Orca  rod holders for dipsey setups and musky trolling.  Always braid.  Been snagged bad as well.  so far so good.  I don't have my drag snugged too tight, though"
843932,miller,2014-03-28 01:04:00,223,Had a customer this summer who lost a talora/tekota combo when a fish hit the dipsey and snapped the holder using a Scotty orca. Cannon tracks/rod holders are another option.

I find 4' cables work well for me but others use different lengths.    I loop a wire between the reel and seat to attach one end.    The other end clips to the grab rail.  "
