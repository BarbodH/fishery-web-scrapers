843400,jimmer,2014-03-25 20:10:00,2730,"So we went with a group of 5 guys for three days of ice fishing and only caught one walleye over 18"". I doubt most of the group will want to go back. I myself don't really need to keep any walleye for the table, but others desire it. I feel/fear for the operators on that lake. Hopefully it's the right decision."
843422,aplumma,2014-03-25 21:12:00,6896,Hopefully the people will show up to support the changes that are needed to revive the fishery   Art
843492,Gerritt,2014-03-26 00:31:00,6129,"After reading this it appears the recreational anglers are getting screwed yet a little more in terms of pickeral... With little mention of the commercial damage to the fishery. It is worrisome that the government is siding with commercial/native initiatives rather then the the majority....  I fear that the lake and the economy in the region will not benefit from these changes.  That said those going for panfish will welcome the change, however I never hear of anyone driving to nipissing for perch from the south when simcoe etc is so much closer.  Once again the powers that be are blind to the real problem on nipissing.  G"
843517,Joey,2014-03-26 01:04:00,9122,"So there is not slot then?  You can keep a pickerel over 18""?"
843529,Rod Caster,2014-03-26 01:22:00,5784,"I'm ok with the changes. I also like how in the information release they included the commercial fishery as a concern to the health of the fish population.  I don't see how the recreational fisherman is getting screwed by the MNR. They are making the changes based on the walleye-fisheries health, data, numbers. The other concerns are out of their control. I'll log-in to the Registry and support their proposal.  If the MNR changes/regulations are combined with positive changes/regulations by the First Nations, then Nipissing might once again be a world-class walleye lake in 10 years or less."
843536,Gerritt,2014-03-26 01:29:00,6129,"Rod caster, I would agree with your last paragraph.  All stakeholders need to contribute to making nipissing a world class fishery again.  I really hope it happens.  G"
843572,Nipfisher,2014-03-26 09:52:00,2449,"Yes Joey you can keep 2 walleye 18"" and above."
843573,Nipfisher,2014-03-26 09:57:00,2449,Just saw this in another story.
