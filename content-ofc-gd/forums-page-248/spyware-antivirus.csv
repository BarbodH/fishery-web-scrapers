843569,forgop,2014-03-26 03:23:00,9,I run advanced system care ultimate. Not free but got me up and running when I had some major issues and all the above failed. I happen to have a license number I haven't used for the pro version I bought on accident thinking the ultimate had expired. PM me if you want to give it a shot.
843570,GBW,2014-03-26 05:13:00,8460,"I'm going with Highdrifter on this one.  I use the MS and Security Essentials too with no problems.  However, some ISP's give a software to use too at no cost.  Bell has what was MacAfee and now branded as Intel Security.  It's good too as my office uses it with no problems."
