843889,grimsbylander,2014-03-27 19:18:00,3016,"There are vehicles that are designed and made to tow and those which are simply able to tow. If you choice the latter, you take your chances. If you have to choose the latter, try to mitigate the risk by staying well under the towing capacity, no overdrive, use tranny coolers and proper hitch assemblies. Even take a second vehicle if possible and load it with passengers and supplies. The fuel in the second vehicle is still cheaper than a $1500 ++ tranny and an afternoon on the side of the highway."
843905,aplumma,2014-03-27 21:26:00,6896,"Apluma, Sir where can I get gas for $4.00 a gallons here? I'm willing to pay $5.00 USD. $1.34 a Lt yesterday. Fill every container you have before showing your passport this year.  You're bang on, towing down the road in a fairly strait line is one thing, stopping for an emergency on baby brakes on a mini van is a totally different scenario. OWWWCH I did not know it has gotten that far out of hand. I bought gas up North Last August and I thought I paid around $4.00. I drive a truck that holds 36 gallons and if I fill it at the border I can make it to Docus and then add 20 gallons of  gas I can just make it back out of Canada. I usually bring 30 gallons of canned gas as well as 28gal of gas in the boat for the week. so a week of fuel is 132 gallons. I guess it is all prospective the big boat holds 100 gallons and gets 1.5 gallons a mile. Here is hoping that the price of gas comes down to the point where it is not a choice between fishing or other expenses.   Art"

I am also very careful when I shift, always on full stop before shifting to another gear. I also try not to park up or downhill and let the transmission do the vehicle parking."

Said he never buy another one ever.  So be bought an Envoy and it's been a total disaster too. He just can't win.  Man both bad for transitions in my experience.  Rizzo you know what your towing capacity for the Caravan is, you need to determine the weight of the boat and all. Tow it to a scrap yard, unhook it and get it weighed. Guessing is over. A important thing to consider is tongue weight. If the ball and receiver isn't properly aligned it throws everything off and numbers get tossed out the window. My next door neighbour had the improper drop on his hitch, once that was corrected he said he can't even tell his boat and trailer is behind him on one of those imitation 2 WD Ford SUV's."
843833,aplumma,2014-03-27 12:05:00,6896,"I got to go with the wisdom of Bernie here. He has seen a lot of vehicles and the caravan just is not a good tow vehicle. If it is disposable then have a go and tow with it but don't be surprised when it lunches itself. If it is in pretty decent condition and it can live as your people hauling vehicle it might be best not to ruin it. It is not all about temperature and the life of a transmission. You have other factors such as gear ratio, fluid volume, internal materials, brakes, electrical and suspension in no particular order. These can I tow with this vehicle posts kill me because everyone wants to bring a knife to a gun fight. If you have a doubt about it chances are it is your inner brain telling you it is not a good idea. It is not that I mind people making a choice to abuse there vehicles and even blow them up it is the safety factor that other people around you depend on that you are driving a safe vehicle that can start and stop in a timely manner. I rarely see vehicles down here not matched to the job because you will get a ticket and if it is grossly mismatched they will impound the trailer on the spot. I am sure it has to do with gas being $3.45 a gallon versus $4.00 plus up North but at some point the phrase ""you got to pay to play"" should come to mind.  Sorry if this sounds like it is pointed at you Rizzo it isn't. It is for all of the people who I see in my trips up North not matching the vehicle to the job.   Art"
843836,DanD,2014-03-27 12:23:00,2223,"For the number of times you're going to tow; rent a truck or a full sized van. I just went to the U-Hall web site and got an estimate for a 7 day rental and 500klm for a cargo van and it came to $299.00. I also think there are cheaper places you could rent from? There use to be a place here in London called Ugly Duckling Rentals. They were older vehicles but were reasonably maintained with things like AC not working or some bents here and there. Yea it'll cost you a few hundred bucks; but so will the trans cooler, a load leveling hitch to distribute the tongue weight and the possibility of blowing out a 3 grand transmission. One other thing to think about, regardless of whether the caravan can pull the boat; can it stop it in a panic situation?  Dan. "
