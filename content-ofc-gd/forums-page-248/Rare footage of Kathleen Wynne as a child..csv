I look at my income tax when I file it. I check it every year at both the federal and provincial level. Who keeps the most money in my pocket is who gets my vote. I
844284,limeyangler,2014-03-29 22:37:00,5204,I am a liberal but McGuinty and Wynne are obviously lying. Charges should laid. Problem is I despise Hudack even more. Actually I don't trust any politician period. They all disgust me.  Right on the money with that one

844173,cram,2014-03-29 14:37:00,1733,"That's pretty funny.  I'm a pretty liberal guy in general, but this gov needs to go. Or at least call an election and give everyone a choice."
844175,4x4bassin,2014-03-29 14:47:00,1025,That made me laugh   I actually remember that episode of the little rascals !

844216,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-29 16:47:00,4399,"Let me add this...the NDP have been propping up this corrupt Liberal regime for two years...Horwath should do the right thing and end the NDP`s support if she does not then that shows a clear lack of respect for the tax payers of this province, Do the right thing Andrea if you play this right you may just win a few extra seats to boot!!!"
844219,npt1,2014-03-29 17:10:00,220,You can always tell when a politician is lying..   There lips move.  
844220,lew,2014-03-29 17:18:00,12766,"I guess some are finally getting the message....about time!!!  Sad part is, Wynne and her Lie-berals will probably get back in....again."
844223,Musky or Specks,2014-03-29 17:26:00,2710,"That's pretty funny.  I'm a pretty liberal guy in general, but this gov needs to go. Or at least call an election and give everyone a choice. As if there is any choice between one crooked politician and another."
844224,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-29 17:27:00,4399,yes Lew that is sad and if that turns out to be what happens then us good folk north of the mullet line should hold a referendum to separate from the lunatics in the 416!!!  Viva Le Mulet!!!
844226,Lunatic,2014-03-29 17:39:00,536,"im not a hudak fan either,but the liberals need to be taught a lesson,they have been crushed at the federal level and need it to happen at the provincial level,but the province of toronto will re-elect them and as usual one city holds an entire province hostage."

844254,bigugli,2014-03-29 19:06:00,6138,"Yes the liberals are crooks, but so is every other dirt bag running for office. The Harris gang was not any better. They all promise everything and anything to get elected, and once in they screw you royally. Not one of them gives a tinker's darn about any of us (unless some here are shoving wads into their party funds)"

Not one of them gives a tinker's darn about any of us (unless some here are shoving wads into their party funds)    But Harris did exactly what he said he would do, and stuck to his platform and got elected and re-elected. Dont recall any other politician who said what they were going to do and did it, other then Rob Ford, and as far as i am concerned any politician can do what they want as long as they spend my tax dollars wisely, and save me money at the end of the day."

Must of had a brand new set of tires by the looks of it. Whats the term??? A bucket of smashed A-wholes???  Send your e-mails and voice your concerns, disgust and just plain name calling cause its' the only way to keep these thieves on their toes for now.  I'm glad more and more people are vocalizing their anger every where I turn these days. Can't wait to see where it leads but I hope we can instill fear in the hearts and minds of those who supposedly have our best intrests at heart. Just wished it would have happened years ago."
844263,tb4me,2014-03-29 20:26:00,3295,"She wont be involved in any charges,But my Mcsquinty must be worried..Rightfully so..What will most likely happen is some peeon will take the fall.."
844266,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-29 20:40:00,4399,Being complacent is certainly not the answer...the Liberals have done nothing but lie and mis lead us and now the evidence is mounting that the former Premier was involved in criminal activity to try and cover up the crimes. And now the present Premier wants us to believe she knows nothing...the Liberals need to be sent a strong message and Andrea Horwath can get the ball rolling by not supporting the upcoming budget!
