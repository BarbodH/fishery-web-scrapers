844114,bayofquintecharters,2014-03-29 02:45:00,9,"Hey Guys,  As you guys may or may not know here in Canada we are now able to view all Canadian charts (even with the sonar charts layer) on line for free at http://www.navionics.com/en/webapp.  The depth units are displayed in meters though. I was talking with Navionics today and it is an easy change for them to make the units displayed as feet.  I told them I would take a few polls to get an idea of what the general fishing public wanted.  Please take the 5 seconds to leave your opinion on which units you prefer when looking at charts.  Thank you.  Scott"

844194,Crazy Ivan,2014-03-29 15:27:00,184,"By the way, thanks for the link. It's nice to be able to study lakes here at home before heading out.  Maybe they could make all depth units available to choose. Meters/feet/fathoms."
