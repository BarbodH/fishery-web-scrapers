843896,misfish,2014-03-27 21:03:00,29133,"Yup,getting out with our pops( those that still can) are treasured moments. I dont get out much fishing with him,but always look forward to our November dates. Theres also the ""wood needs to be split and stacked times""  Nice Bill."
843920,BillM,2014-03-27 23:14:00,17367,"Theres also the ""wood needs to be split and stacked times""  Nice Bill.  Lots and lots of this as well    I'm glad he bought a log splitter a few years ago though, lol!  Thanks for the kind words guys, there's no one I'd rather fish with than the old man..   The times have definitely changed, he's mostly along for the ride now and I do the rest..  It's nice to give back and put him on fish, since he did it for so long for all us kids.   I get more excited when he lands a big fish, then I ever thought I would..   Gotta take advantage of the time we've got, life is definitely too short."
843925,outllaw,2014-03-27 23:52:00,1232,cherish every minute.. awesome. I got to do the same. man I miss digging worms and going with dad.
843774,BillM,2014-03-27 00:56:00,17367,"Too much hockey talk, thought it was about time for a mini report.  Was on the water probably 3-4 days a week at a minimum with the oldman, crappie, bass, pike, whatever it didn't matter.  Being so close to great fishing, we can be on the water in under 30mins... Can't beat that on a weekday, great weather, zero traffic, lots of fish..   Had a lot of fun bass fishing this fall, I spent some time vertical jigging and it paid off in spades..  5-10 fish evenings quickly turned into 20-30 fish evenings with bonus fish such as walleyes..   Such a deadly technique once you locate these fish... The 80b Terrova with I-Pilot Link made staying on top of these fish even easier.   Did quite well later in the season off the deeper drops slow rolling spinnerbaits as well.        "
843776,bushart,2014-03-27 01:01:00,2628,Some honkers there man  for sure--locating fish in deep water and sitting over them vertical jigging--can pay off in size and numbers
843782,Slop,2014-03-27 01:16:00,151,The first pic is my favorite. Good times with your dad Bill.
843785,Tim Mills,2014-03-27 01:24:00,476,Great photo of your dad will those am.
843787,moxie,2014-03-27 01:27:00,1566,Dad introduced me to fishing (from shore)40+ years ago but because of his fear of being on the water I never got to return the favour. Lasting memories for you both. Good for you Bill and some beautiful fish.
843788,Steve1991,2014-03-27 01:32:00,27,Looks like some great times with the Pops.  Beauty bass.

843820,4x4bassin,2014-03-27 04:00:00,1025,"Great report there Bill , looks like your pops schooled ya !!!  I love sitting over bass and  jigging them out of deep water , great pattern for me in late summer/early fall on my lakes ."
843821,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-27 04:25:00,8243,"You don't know how blessed you are to be able to share what you love with the old guy and he sure looks like he loves it too. Dad is still with us at 87 but he never enjoyed the outdoors. I took him when I was 30, after an hour or so you could tell he wanted to go home but toughed it out for 2 days. I asked him years later why he didn't take us out to fish, hunt, camp etc. like my cousins, It p'd me off he never would take us fishing. He told me about sleeping in the mountains in the winter without shelter hiding from the Germans when he was a teen. They were taking kids as young as 13 or they would kill your entire family in the village. Don't  I feel like an ass now.  Some nice bass there Bill, good on you both."

843874,msp,2014-03-27 18:30:00,1336,Nice one Bill. I also love spending time with the old man on the water. He started me fishing at a very early age. Taught me so many things back then. Its funny now because Im the one teaching him how to fish and what to use.
843886,kickingfrog,2014-03-27 19:06:00,8333,"I'm still trying to figure out which of the two is the ""old man"".  The ""young"" one is known as eyebrows; the other, sideburns.  Some of my best fishing memories are fishing with my dad. I hope I can do the same for my son."
843893,mercman,2014-03-27 20:42:00,7054,Geez Bill !!! Great report. I sure wish I could fish with the Ole Man again .....
