841832,The Urban Fisherman,2014-03-18 12:21:00,2050,"Things come in threes I guess as it's been several months since I've been fishing or had time to get on OFC - I'm glad to be back and hope to contribute with more reports this season than last!  This past year we built the house, moved to my wife's grandmother's place, then into our new home and followed up our busy summer with an even busier winter. Luke and Averie both started hockey this winter which chewed into the tiny bit of spare time I had the past several months.  This kids have been bugging me to go ice fishing all year, Averie because we hadn't been in two seasons due to a lack of decent ice and the other two as they've never been ice fishing!  This weekend we finally had time to get out.  We fished longpoint for Perch and though the bite wasn't stellar the kids still caught a few fish and had a great time out on the ice!                                    The next day they wanted more so we hit up another spot and tried to find some bluegill/crappie/perch - only to come up short with a couple of OUT OF SEASON fish that both went straight back down the hole until their respective openers!  We had a bunch of light bites that punked us for our minnows which I'm sure were pannies as we were parked right on a big green weedbed.            Those two days wrapped up our ice fishing for 2014 - and so far have been our only two days of fishing this year.  Hopefully we will have much more to report once the ice takes a hike!  Cheers,  Ryan & the kids. ( And Mommy )"
841834,bushart,2014-03-18 12:58:00,2628,Looks great---and like all little kids----when the fishin gets slow----there's always the minnows in the bucket to chase around
841838,DanD,2014-03-18 13:15:00,2223,Oh man have your kids grown since the last I seen them at the trailer. They still have their great smiles though; must get that from mom. LOL  Dan.

Oh man have your kids grown since the last I seen them at the trailer. They still have their great smiles though; must get that from mom. LOL  Dan.  lol yeah Dan and they're way bigger pains to!!!  Luckily they got mom's brains as well ( well the girls anyway haha ).  It's been way to long! Please keep in touch so we can get together this summer!
841846,mattybculp,2014-03-18 13:42:00,388,I love pic number 15 your daughter is holding that perch like a pro ! Classic!
841849,DanD,2014-03-18 14:38:00,2223,"That be great to get out and wet a line with you and the kids Ryan. Andy (my son) and I are just beginning to look for a new to us boat; if that works out, we'll get the kids out on the bay for some perch and maybe potahawk for a swim. My card is starting to fill up though; doing a pig roast in June at Andy's Stag & Doe, trailer trash events at the park and who knows what in-between the fish-a-thon (hopping to make it there this year), my week up North and Andy's wedding in September. If we get the boat we're hoping to (18-20' bow-rider); there will be more then enough safe room for you and your brood. LOL  Dan."
841851,Walleye'm Fishing,2014-03-18 14:48:00,310,"Awesome. Your kids look like they had a blast on the ice. In many ways, I find that it's much easier to bring kids ice fishing as opposed to boat or shore fishing. I always end up taking my 4 year old son fishing with me so much more during the winter time."
841863,solopaddler,2014-03-18 17:08:00,8605,"Nice to see you post Ryan, looks like a great time.  Side note, but man your kids are growing!"
841866,fishnsled,2014-03-18 17:32:00,3520,Great report Ryan!!  Always enjoy reading your family reports.  Looks like a fantastic time for everyone!!
841884,irishfield,2014-03-18 19:08:00,26272,Ryan and his four kids... love every report!!
841909,misfish,2014-03-18 21:03:00,29133,"Read the report earlier Ryan,,but couldnt see the pics.  Was worth waiting to see. Great report and family time..  Sure are growing up fast."
842030,The Urban Fisherman,2014-03-19 13:06:00,2050,"I love pic number 15 your daughter is holding that perch like a pro ! Classic! Thanks Matty - She's been fishing with me since she was still in a stroller so she's quite the experienced little angler...  That be great to get out and wet a line with you and the kids Ryan.

Wow buddy you are going to have one busy summer! lol Averie has bugged me to go see you guys at the trailer, not sure that the little ones would remember.  Congrats to Andy on the wedding ( where are you doing the Stag and Doe? ) Congrats on the boat to - we'll bring the snacks and minnows! lol I've been wanting to take the kids to potahawk for a swim but we only have the 14 foot duck boat so it's not the safest way to make a trip out there.  Keep me posted and drop me a line anytime you're down this way!!!  Awesome. Your kids look like they had a blast on the ice. In many ways, I find that it's much easier to bring kids ice fishing as opposed to boat or shore fishing. I always end up taking my 4 year old son fishing with me so much more during the winter time.  Yeah I'd say it's easier to except we don't often get very much ice down this way so I'm always on edge.  My oldest stepped in a hole that hadn't quite frozen over overnight when she was 3 and went in up to her hips......it scared the crap out of me.  After that I started putting her on a harness & leash when out on the ice! lol This year we have almost 2 feet of ice so it's good.  Either way, 1 four year old was a piece of cake compared to 3,4 & 7 year olds all at once! Nice to see you post Ryan, looks like a great time.  Side note, but man your kids are growing!  Thanks Mike - Long time no talk, hope all is well man! The kids are growing like weeds... bad weeds! The 3 year old is starting to talk back already!   They need more time with daddy out in the boat. Great report Ryan!!  Always enjoy reading your family reports.  Looks like a fantastic time for everyone!!  Thanks Buddy - you have to get back down this way this summer... no excuses, we have to make it happen!  Ryan and his four kids... love every report!!  haha Thanks Wayne!  Read the report earlier Ryan,,but couldnt see the pics.  Was worth waiting to see. Great report and family time..  Sure are growing up fast.  Thanks Bri - Appreciate the kind words and looking forward to seeing more reports for you as well!"
842088,Rich,2014-03-19 20:30:00,3927,"Good to see you finally broke away from HQ buddy!  Great times and great fish as always it seems!  Glad the yocals haven't decimated the OOS stocks.. i heard about the discussions on ""that board"" earlier in the winter. Typical.  Keep it up Ryan! You're a little closer now.. I'm sure we could get a couple hrs of fishing in sometime this spring!"
842356,highdrifter,2014-03-20 20:10:00,2534,Atta boyyeee!!  That's some nice ice time with the fam..  We're expecting our first in September..  I'm hoping it's gonna be a girl!
842466,wormdunker,2014-03-21 10:35:00,1711,I love your report & the pix are awesome!  The little one laying flat on the ice staring down the hole - priceless!!
843973,The Urban Fisherman,2014-03-28 13:55:00,2050,"Sorry to dig this thread back up guys - I wasn't able to get back on and didn't want my homies to think I was ignoring them! haha   Good to see you finally broke away from HQ buddy!Great times and great fish as always it seems!Glad the yocals haven't decimated the OOS stocks.. i heard about the discussions on ""that board"" earlier in the winter. Typical.Keep it up Ryan! You're a little closer now.. I'm sure we could get a couple hrs of fishing in sometime this spring!  Thanks brotha - It was nice to get out of the house for a couple of days!  I have a busy spring ahead of me but I'm hoping to log some serious hours on the bay this summer seeing as I live 30 seconds from the launch now.  My parents are moving down here and my old man actually got himself a slip for his boat this summer so I'll always have a boat in the water, literally a few hundred meters from my door step!  We better log some time on the water together this year!  The local inland OOS stock should be fairly safe from the ice fishing fools who like to keep illegal fish, but man they take a SERIOUS beating opening weekend!  That's the time I'm worried about... sure the season is open but I've seen guys keep twice their limit.  This year I'm sending the MNR to have a look see for themselves.  Talk soon dude! Atta boyyeee!!  That's some nice ice time with the fam..  We're expecting our first in September..  I'm hoping it's gonna be a girl!  HD! It's been a long, long time brotha - and you're having a freakin' BABY!?!?! CONGRATS - I had Averie with me pike fishing Humber Bay Park when she was 7 days old and I expect no less from you!  Not gonna lie - girls are WAY easier then boys... when they're little anyways...  Congrats once again, and keep in touch!  I love your report & the pix are awesome! The little one laying flat on the ice staring down the hole - priceless!!  Thanks WD - I thought that was pretty funny to... We were only fishing in about 5-6 feet of clear water and she was actually looking to see if we drilled over weeds or not... That hole was a dud!"
