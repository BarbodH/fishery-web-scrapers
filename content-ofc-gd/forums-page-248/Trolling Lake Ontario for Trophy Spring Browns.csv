843796,miller,2014-03-27 01:56:00,223,Better yet the guys that have no clue going 4+ miles an hour lol.
843813,pairofgreenhorns,2014-03-27 02:42:00,133,"Great report, as Mike said you scratched your itch, but now I have one. Love how you are chipping away the ice. Where there's a will there's a way. nice browns to boot!"
843849,The Urban Fisherman,2014-03-27 13:45:00,2050,COOOL stuff!  Funny you mention sandy beaches for early season Browns on Lake O.  I've done very well fishing sandy beaches for early season inland browns in smaller bodies of water as well.  Thanks for the report Aaron!  Cheers Ryan
843854,Aaron Shirley,2014-03-27 15:51:00,655,"Dave, the Grimsby area is a good area for early spring browns, but a feasible launch ramp for a big boat is another story until the ice melts away. There are big browns from Grimsby to Port Dalhousie. Probably some of the biggest browns in the lake like that area for some reason.  Thanks again for the comments everyone. Sometimes you ""hero"" and other times ""zero""! My buddy Dean and I spent 2 hours chipping ice away at Port Credit launch yesterday, then broke ice all the way to the lake to troll the shoreline in and around the PC area. It sucked! Not one bite. No signs of life. Water was gin clear except for a slight stain right at the mouth. It was really windy and freezing cold. My inline boards froze up so bad they started to fall over with the weight of the ice!  We even tried some drifting roe and casting spinners, spoons and plugs from the hwy 2 bridge down to the lake for a bit. Nadda. It was dead. I think the fish that guys were catching ice fishing there not long ago have moved up. Sometimes ya take a bullet while experimenting, but ya never know until you try. That is how you discover new bites. I will head back to the south shore or fish Niagara with my boat next time. I don't think there are many browns around Port Credit. I couldn't launch in the west end, as the only ramp that was free of ice was Fisherman's Pier and the gate is locked   Burlington Beach/Lift Bridge is where I really wanted to try for browns. That area is a major historical spot for early brown trout, but it hasn't been good in many years. I just wanted to try it out. None of the other ramps close to it are even remotely ready to launch a boat. I wish Fisherman's Pier opened earlier."
843857,Afraz,2014-03-27 16:20:00,250,"Good Report Aaron, always nice to hear from you.  Your reports got me setting up my tackle and organizing the lot from late evening all the way till 5 in the morning haha  Now if the ice would melt around the Trophy for me to pull her out."
843875,msp,2014-03-27 18:33:00,1336,Nice browns Aaron !
844160,Moosebunk,2014-03-29 12:59:00,3970,First one is a real CRACKAH eh!!!  Browns are beauts... solid fishing as always Aaron.

843130,leaf4,2014-03-24 19:34:00,2466,"nice haul, good on you for braving the cold early season conditions as you said, not many are even thinking about giving it a go, certainly looks like it paid off"
843131,mike rousseau,2014-03-24 19:37:00,4661,Always wanted to try that...
843132,Sinker,2014-03-24 19:38:00,8692,Good work buddy!!  S.
843135,Freshtrax,2014-03-24 19:48:00,2215,God I need to try that.
843139,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-24 19:53:00,4399,Nice!!!
843154,dave524,2014-03-24 20:42:00,4508,Nice going   Usually a good shorecaster could hit your inside planer board I guess
843175,spincast,2014-03-24 21:53:00,3279,sweet!  - counting down the days till I see those greeny blue hues of Lake O on either side of the gunnels
843178,Gallie,2014-03-24 22:14:00,1215,"Oh man those browns look nice, i cant wait for kings...."
843191,moxie,2014-03-24 23:05:00,1566,Beautiful Brownies. Bonus time of year if you can gain access to water. No crowds and fighting Trout in open water is an absolute blast.
843216,Tim Mills,2014-03-25 00:22:00,476,"Excellent report, thx for posting"
843226,solopaddler,2014-03-25 00:54:00,8605,"Sweet fish bud, glad to see you scratched the itch!"
843228,NANUK,2014-03-25 01:00:00,797,"WOW!! Nice !!!, solid effort with some beauty results. Thanks for sharing not only pictures but your tips & techniques,"
843360,Aaron Shirley,2014-03-25 17:09:00,655,"Thanks everyone. I plan on getting out again real soon  Dave, I give the shore casters room and swing out deeper when I encounter them lol"
843386,Joeytier,2014-03-25 19:40:00,3990,Awesome!  I used to love the early spring footballs...amazing how fat those things get in the big O.
843392,Jds63,2014-03-25 19:56:00,1365,"wow ... very nice Aaron , great pictures !"
843562,spinnerdoc,2014-03-26 02:26:00,556,Those are good looking....actually killer looking fish Aaron
843576,fishindevil,2014-03-26 10:06:00,6254,well done aaron !!! i miss those days for sure !!! some awesome spring browns man...
843588,superdad,2014-03-26 12:04:00,353,"Aaron,  Now you've done it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Got the blood flowing and the need to launch and get out for those browns.  We've still got lots of ice in the eastern basin of BIg O.  Those are really nice fish - it seems that the fish in the western part of the lake are larger that down this way. We rarely see fish averaging the size you got.  Thanks for sharing and thanks for the details.  David  aka  Superdad"
843593,Joey,2014-03-26 12:18:00,9122,Sweet Browns Aaron.  Way to go.  Nice to see a soft water report.  Spring is in the air
843604,4x4bassin,2014-03-26 13:33:00,1025,"Those are some nice browns , beautiful fish ! Like Joey said glad to see the soft water reports start to come in"
843698,esoxansteel,2014-03-26 21:04:00,1307,"Awesome open water report Aaron, new you would be one of the first to brave the open water elements"
843731,kevin booth,2014-03-26 23:01:00,57,nicely done and great fish.
843732,dave524,2014-03-26 23:03:00,4508,"Thanks everyone. I plan on getting out again real soon  Dave, I give the shore casters room and swing out deeper when I encounter them lol        Actually, for the last 30 years I've lived a 2 minute walk from the old pumphouse/pier here in Grimsby, can see the lake from my place   I was trying to put some perspective on how close to shore you should be for early browns. Most of the guys are too far out from my experience."
