Both myself and a good buddy of mine are looking for spots around Kawartha Lakes or within okay driving distance for speckled trout. I understand if you don't want to share your secret spots and I totally agree with you for not but would like to some waters that speckles are in. We know of one spot in Haliburton county just looking for a few more.  Thanks,  Will"
841944,BillM,2014-03-18 23:14:00,17367,Algonquin would be a great bet.  Lots and lots of stocked lakes to choose from.  MNR also publishes a report which shows which lake got how many fish and the frequency in which they are stocked.
841947,danc,2014-03-18 23:18:00,4677,"Yup what Bill said. If you get the MNR stocking list for your area, you even have the luxury of targeting bigger (5 year old) fish."
841956,dropaline,2014-03-18 23:47:00,20,Okay thanks for the info guys I will look into that.
