BUT it get's the bills paid so I can keep fishing. I had a pretty interesting year. My wife and I bought our first house together and cut our commute down to 20 mins from work. I do miss living in Orillia and being able to launch my boat when I got off work in less than 15 mins and fishing in 10. But such is life, now I live near barrie and can explore the south end of lady Simcoe.  Here are some pictures to recap my year. I had a fantastic time fishing tournaments, cash a couple of chq's to cover expenses and cruising with the wife and our new pup. Let's get to the pictures, if you wanna share your memories this year. I love to see them, makes winter pass quickly lol.   This was during the CSFL Fall Challenge on Lake Couchiching. We finished the event in 3rd place after a cold and wet 2 day event. Best part was a shiny medal.            Our first boat ride with our puppy. She's a Shiba Inu and her name is hana. Right now she's growing like crazy and acting like a teenager... sigh     I hope everyone enjoys the photo's. There is a lot more pictures and I'll try to add some more to my gallery in the near future. Tight lines everyone and have a safe holiday.    "
