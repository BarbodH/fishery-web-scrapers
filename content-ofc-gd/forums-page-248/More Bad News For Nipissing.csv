843413,Bernie,2014-03-25 20:58:00,3190,I like this rule better than the previous slot.At least what you catch will have some meat on the fillets. I threw back small ones anyway. Didn't leave much to keep with the slot size.
843418,curlrap,2014-03-25 21:06:00,58,"Walleye are going to be in demand now, i can picture all the walleye for sale signs. The natives are going to have to fish extremely hard to supply all the walleye cravings people are going to have. This is great news for them and theres no limit when it comes to purchasing these fish."
843530,Oggie,2014-03-26 01:23:00,588,And there's the problem. If people don't buy it they wont fish. Its not  about the cultural harvest. Time to educate the public. Dan o.

843568,woodenboater,2014-03-26 03:23:00,2277,Saw this on my Twitter feed. Looks like Nip is not the only lake to have walleye issues. Wonder if the MNR could follow lead and change the pike and bass regs as well for certain lakes ?  http://www.startribune.com/local/252352921.html?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=t.co

If I catch a 19"" and a 14"" what's wrong with that? I will not squawk about the Native rights to fish commercially as it is their right.  Is there over-fishing? absolutely. What is over-fishing?  Lots of anglers caught lots of walleye (mostly small) this winter. Those smaller walleye swim through the 3"" x 3"" squares in the nets. The 18""+ fish do not.  I will focus my angling on pike, muskie, bass, and perch this year. I will keep some walleye but not target them as often."
843574,Nipfisher,2014-03-26 09:58:00,2449,"Just saw this in another story.  Concerns about the cormorant population on the lake also continue to go unheeded, Fedeli continued.  “We know cormorants are responsible for taking more than 100,000 kilograms of fish out of the lake each year.  It’s mindboggling that the Ministry continues to downplay this factor as well,” said Fedeli. "

The 51000 kg mentioned in the article is for all the fisheries native and non native.  At the meeting yesterday i was lead to believe the kgs for the first nation and the anglers are almost even.

The angler harvest is by creel surveys, apparently there is a real science to it we had a crew doing it in the french river and the omnr do the rest of the lake.  As for the first nation non compliance or questionable catch numbers each person is reviewed individually and assigned a number of fish based on # of times out, fisherman skills, locations and dates, and the numbers are compared with other reporting fisherman. For the most part fish move in schools during hot summer weather so where one fisherman is getting them they usually follow that person.  The mesh size they use is 3.5 and 3.75"". if they go any smaller the bicatch is at least doubled and the 4"" well it is illegal to sell the larger walleye due to contaminates."
843678,Bernie,2014-03-26 19:36:00,3190,Hello Crosshairs. I appreciate your input.  I am curious and have a question for you. I often hear and sometimes see the commercial boats out through the night out on the reefs in the South Bay. Why do they do this at night?

At work everything is polical, so doesn't necessarily mean the right decisions being made, deal with OMNR always a polical agenda there too just get tired.  Anyways, Bernie there is a huge problem with nets being tampered with, stolen, damaged etc. There is less chance of them being seen setting them and harder for the people to find them. The OPP and OMNR are trying to get a handle on it, they want to create a data base with dates, times, locations boats seen in the vasinaty. Also some just don't want to upset people that are angling in the area, but we do have some that don't give a ---- either. The majority of the time I am out there after dark and early morning.  Humans are very predictable, and don't like to change. One of our fisherman I just need to look at the calendar and water temp and I will know where to find him, most them have everything documented on their calendars in there garages and welcome me to veiw them. It doesn't matter what race we all have bad apples.  aKashag, no thank you I have read alot of your posts and enjoyed them.  I understand people don't like the unknown, and in regards to first nations it isn't taught in schools or at least it hasn't in the past. I have several friends who actually hated first nations people until they started to learn about the history and have became good friends now. They understand a bit better why things are done the way they are. I try to share what ever information I can, I have to be careful because of my work lol. Hopefully we can collectively work through these hard times and get this lake back to a healthy state.  Take Care all."

843729,aplumma,2014-03-26 22:49:00,6896,I fit into this equation as a tourist my roll in this is to bring money to the area and leave it there. This affects everyone  in the Nipissing area. I personally do not fish for walleye unless a friend wants to run out in the evening I will tag along. I am hopeful that the fisheries will recover to the point that it attracts more people to bring money in and support the local economy. My view is that the area needs both the fisheries as well as tourism to make the area better off. With discussions between the angling population and the Natives both remembering that it is the third part called the tourists that can take it or leave the area.   Art

I have a cottage in the Kawartha's and haven't harvested a walleye from up there in over 5 years maybe 10. Still fish them a little but let them all go. If I want a feed of fish I go after crappies,bluegills or perch and even keep the odd smallie. Lotsa pike up on Nip still I assume. I actually prefer eating them over walleye. And I see reports and pictures of decent perch.  Just throwing that out there. Might be a good idea to try and change a few people's minds and point them in a different direction to help the walleye fishery recover.

How many times do we have to keep chasing that same  piece of tail?  Great idea. Lets blame the birds so we don't offend anyone, then give the commercial fishers and the indian poachers a boat load of money to cull the cormorant flocks. Last time I checked cormorants don't selectively target and fly away with brood stock. Commercial fishers and indian poachers do along with everything else that swims.  Pay them off like the feds and provincial counterparts do when theres a problem with a special interest? What the hell?!?!?!  There are always mitigating factors but when the wheel stops in the same spot time and time again its either time to fix the wheel or throw it in the trash, walk away and move on.  Why do we constantly have to pick up the same damn pieces of the same damn puzzles? Bandaid after bandaid after bandaid without curing the infection or amputating the appendage, treating the symptoms and not the cause. Why do we continue to allow this to happen? Why?

Its not the politically correct answer but its the right one.  People in the south of this province just don't have any idea of whats going on with the native issue, they think they should have the right above other ""equal"" CANADIANS to feed their families.  Those of us up here, who see blonde hair blue eyed ""natives"" getting their status card and filling their freezers and/or bands selling the ""food to feed their families"", know where the problem is and how to fix it.  Unfortunately, thats not the popular or politically correct thing to do...  Newsflash...the world HAS changed, in ways that most people DO NOT like, it has changed their way of life, but we have had to adapt or suffer the consequences.  It is NOT my responsibility to keep subsidizing this ""native"" welfare state because they cannot adapt.  Our natural resources should not be ruined for the sake of those that won't adapt and quit blaming society for things that happened hundreds of years ago."

He also told me they got  hundreds of walleye  this season and probably released close to a hundred as well. So there's more than enough walleye to increase the limit to 4 or keep it the same.

My average size has never been better on Nipissing and has been very good for the last 5-6 years. I won't keep fish over the slot so getting walleye for the last number of years for even one feed has been a challenge.  The question as to what state the lake is in currently is important, but it is even more important to know whether or not it is improving or declining. That can't be determined from a few fishing trips every year. If you are familiar with the body of water a few trips can indeed be a telling snap shot of how the fishery is doing. Rice lake isn't as large as Nip but being our home lake we noticed something had changed with the Walleye fishery there right away just as we noticed the rebound a couple of seasons after the 2010 slot size introduction. Nip is doomed simply because of two main factors and neither of them include honest, ethical anglers who keep a couple fish per table. As long as commercial nets and illegal the illegal Indian slaughter continues the Walleye fishery is doomed.  It pains me to see and hear of all the money we as sportsmen and women dump into the system and private associations have still have to do all the heavy lifting in an effort to keep the systems afloat instead of enhancing them.

How many times do we have to keep chasing that same  piece of tail?  Great idea. Lets blame the birds so we don't offend anyone, then give the commercial fishers and the indian poachers a boat load of money to cull the cormorant flocks. Last time I checked cormorants don't selectively target and fly away with brood stock. Commercial fishers and indian poachers do along with everything else that swims.  Pay them off like the feds and provincial counterparts do when theres a problem with a special interest? What the hell?!?!?!  There are always mitigating factors but when the wheel stops in the same spot time and time again its either time to fix the wheel or throw it in the trash, walk away and move on.  Why do we constantly have to pick up the same damn pieces of the same damn puzzles? Bandaid after bandaid after bandaid without curing the infection or amputating the appendage, treating the symptoms and not the cause. Why do we continue to allow this to happen? Why?

Incredible that the stakeholders are even considering limiting sport fishing options even further with zero scientific evidence to suggest it would help.
840168,Garfisher,2014-03-07 03:33:00,229,"Yea cause it's not like the MNR samples the lake using calibrated methods and gear (Fall Walleye Index Netting, Near Shore Community Index Netting, and Broad-Scale Monitoring to name a few) and uses the results to extrapolate to how much of a population there is or anything. However, the rumour of the limit going to 1 is probably as legitimate as the the rumours about the MNR opening Cisco in Simcoe next year. Until the MNR suggests it in a public document don't hold your breath about it the limit going down to 1."

My average size has never been better on Nipissing and has been very good for the last 5-6 years. I won't keep fish over the slot so getting walleye for the last number of years for even one feed has been a challenge.  The question as to what state the lake is in currently is important, but it is even more important to know whether or not it is improving or declining. That can't be determined from a few fishing trips every year."

840471,akaShag,2014-03-09 20:36:00,2073,"I had understood there was (is?) an unregulated commercial fishery on Lake Nipissing.  It takes a lot of anglers to catch as many walleye as a mile of square hooks.  Stocking fish in hopes of building/rebuilding a viable sports fishery, when (IF?) there is an unregulated commercial operation, strikes me as trying to put out a house fire with a teacup.  And slashing a sports angler's limit to a single small fish sounds like serious HOGTOWN mentality.  My heart goes out to the people of that area who depend on the lake for their livelihoods, since it sure does not sound to me like the government of this province has any intention of helping them out.  If indeed there is a commercial fishery (as I had understood to be the case), perhaps the government could compensate the commercial fishermen and remove the nets from the lake."
840472,Garfisher,2014-03-09 20:48:00,229,"That's not how the regulations work though. Fisheries are split up as follows: Native personal/ceremonial, Native commercial, Commercial, then Recreational. Restrictions will be put on recreational fisheries before commercial fisheries almost always. It's a federal regulation under the Fisheries Act if I remember correctly. Plus the commercial fishery on Nipissing is Native, so good luck trying to get them to reduce their harvest when there is a recreational fishery going on for the same species."
840490,akaShag,2014-03-10 00:48:00,2073,"Back to Garfisher.......  OK so it sounds like the commercial fishery is run by one or more First Nations.  If it is in their economic best interest to surrender the commercial fishery for some valuable consideration (defined however), then perhaps a good faith negotiation could find some common ground to ""buy out"" the commercial ""licence"" and allow the tourist potential of the area to rebound.  I think that personal consumption/ceremonial/etc use by the First Nation(s) involved would not be a significant factor, and should continue.  So maybe the outfitters and other tourist-dependent businesses, in conjunction with the government of Ontario, could find an agreement that would see the commercial fishery cease or decrease significantly.  Everybody wins, if the First Nation(s) involved are willing to accept (for example) job training for young folks and compensation for lost fishing income in return for hanging up their nets.  Just a thought, and no, I do not wear rose-coloured glasses.  There is ALWAYS a solution to a disagreement if both/all sides are willing to bargain in good faith.  This sure looks like a place where a good faith discussion might be useful.  Doug"
840491,Nipfisher,2014-03-10 00:48:00,2449,"Wooden Boater, there is an outstanding bass fishery on Nipissing. Both SM and LM. Pike and Muskie are regular targets of many summer anglers and the Perch population is booming.  Shawn Degagne (writer) and the LNSA are spreading the ""doom and gloom"" in hopes of getting their restocking approved. I am 100% in favour of restocking the lake. Even with minimal success it still adds some fish to the system. As long as it is not costing the anglers, or outfitters.  Finaly I have heard that they are considering other regulations changes that include increasing the slot size bottom measurement from 15.75"" to 16.75"" and keeping the top end the same at 23 & 5/8"". They may also modify the pike slot size and limits and open Bass season for longer. This is all considerations and I believe there wil be no significant changes in the next set of Regs.  Here is an article from the Nugget today. I am in the fur hat and black/grey jacket to the left. "
840496,Garfisher,2014-03-10 02:11:00,229,"akaShag I'm all for that idea. It would be great to create a partnership where commercial harvest is reduced or eliminated while efforts are made to boost populations of walleye in Nipissing. However, considering the first nations are entitled to harvest fish commerically as long as the populations aren't in serious trouble (i.e. the walleye are dangerously close to becoming extirpated/population crashing), I think they would be as opposed to reducing their harvest significantly as anglers would be opposed to further reducing the daily creel limit."
840515,akaShag,2014-03-10 11:46:00,2073,"Well, if there is money in the pot to buy out the operations that would enable the Fist Nation(s) to turn to a different profitable enterprise (s), which does provide work for their youth, they there might well be a path to a greatly reduced commercial harvest.  Anyways, in my view that would be the most likely option to succeed in restoring Nipissing's walleye stocks..............not knowing what OTHER significant factors might well be in play such as invasive species.  But if there is a large commercial catch of walleye, then it is feasible to turn some or part or possibly even all of that into fish that are available for sports anglers.  Doug"

Honest question.  -and imo, pike taste just as nice if not better than wallies  I won't attempt to speak for other walleye fishermen, but think of it this way. You are a walleye fisherman, you get maybe two-three weeks of vacation/year. Are you going to a lake where opportunity for walleye may be limited or are you going to a place where catching walleye, including trophy walleye is very close to a given? Many fishermen decide the latter choice suits them best. It's not a matter of being a snob, it's a matter of what and how one likes to fish, and of course there are other factors to weigh such as increased fuel costs, and increased demands on personal time. As for your preference for pike, I would agree that fresh pike is very good. I would say most folks wouldn't know the difference. I do not care for it once frozen."
