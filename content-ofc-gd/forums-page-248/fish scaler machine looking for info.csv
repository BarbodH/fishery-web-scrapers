843725,skinny,2014-03-26 22:30:00,442,ok some time ago I saw a machine to scale fish not sure if it was in person or a vid but I remember it looked kinda like a propane tank with end cut off and grit glued to the inside walls I also think it might have been used for potatoes also   the tank or cylinder stood up right hole in top and not sure if it vibrated or rotated to cause the action to remove scales  anyway I'm trying to find pictures or video of the beast

843747,grimsbylander,2014-03-26 23:22:00,3016,Yes. They are round shaped motorized machines which were designed to peel potatoes. They work incredibly well on potatoes and I've heard they work great on perch. I have one but have never put fish in it. I can do 10 lbs of potatoes in minutes though!
