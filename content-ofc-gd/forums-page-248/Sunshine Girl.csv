844064,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-28 22:30:00,8243,"Joey,  You are our Sunshine Girl.  Right about beautiful women generally having low self esteem. No one is usually brave enough to approach a gorgeous woman and they think it's because they really aren't that pretty. A famous actress told me that years ago. That's how this mug ended up with a beautiful wife. Most importantly beautiful below all that smooth skin.  As for the woman in question, she gives big head, I mean has a big head. Couldn't help it, sorry."
844068,Sharkbait22,2014-03-28 22:42:00,297,This gal can fish with me anytime http://www.moldychum.com/  Fridays pin-up always a treat.

844099,wkimwes,2014-03-29 01:13:00,76,Is there something wrong that I find the Ugly Stik more appealing?
844106,John Bacon,2014-03-29 01:52:00,3277,"I was a sunshine girl once, when I was pretty young.  Aren't you still pretty young?"
844111,NAW,2014-03-29 02:29:00,4022,Musty's ???  Maybe crotch oders??
844113,Joey,2014-03-29 02:38:00,9122," Aren't you still pretty young?   Aww, I wish.  No, that's not true, I'm comfortable with my age right now.  But thanks"
844149,outllaw,2014-03-29 12:39:00,1232,joey. from what we have seen on here your caring/sharing yep your a sunshine girl. oh ya. with photography talents also.
844268,Canuck,2014-03-29 20:42:00,491,I heard that if the sunshine girl's description says she likes horses its an inside joke and that it means the photographer got some action with her.
844282,aplumma,2014-03-29 22:00:00,6896,I did not meet Joey when she was young but ever since I have known her she has been pretty.   Art
843951,Fisherman,2014-03-28 10:56:00,7201,"Have to look fopr yourself, damm work computer won't allow the link."
843953,Snowball,2014-03-28 12:00:00,167,"Is this the link?  http://www.torontosun.com/sunshine-girl  Regards, SNOWBALL"
843956,Headhunter,2014-03-28 12:42:00,5703,That has to be one of the worst photoshops I've seen!!!! Her head is just a bit too big for the rest of her! HH
843957,Salmonidstalker,2014-03-28 12:55:00,265,"Where do they get these girls?   Brutal. Between Rob Ford and the sunshine girls, you'd think Toronto is the trashiest city."
843963,outllaw,2014-03-28 13:21:00,1232,"she,s related to ford,bye the size of her head"
843969,highdrifter,2014-03-28 13:45:00,2534,Good gawd..   They gotta stop recruiting girls from the Paradise Club..
843971,jedimaster,2014-03-28 13:48:00,3472,"Well, I have had some.. err.. ""experience"" with a couple of sunshine girls. Not all of them are so creepy and weird looking. Part of it is the photography as well. Some of th emodels have had some bad experience with photographers in the past. Its not as happy go lucky as it may seem."
843972,Gerritt,2014-03-28 13:52:00,6129,A 2 @ 10..... But a 10@2...
843979,BillM,2014-03-28 14:31:00,17367,Sunshine girls have gone downhill in recent memory.
843992,bare foot wader,2014-03-28 15:40:00,1354,so it's appropriate she's holding an ugly stick?
843997,NAW,2014-03-28 16:10:00,4022,Yikes.  Not their best by far.  But not he worst either.    Edit..  Pretty horrendous though...
844009,fish_fishburn,2014-03-28 17:00:00,1311,"Yeah, shes not even hot."
844013,porkpie,2014-03-28 17:15:00,2521,Yikes.  House of Lancaster material....
844018,grimsbylander,2014-03-28 17:48:00,3016,Hahaha an Ugly Stick. Good one Wader!
844022,bare foot wader,2014-03-28 18:06:00,1354,"dang, now my conscience is kickin me....in hindsight here, gotta give her/any girl props for having the confidence to share her body with the public to be drooled over/criticized....I was friends with a mildly successful model in college (paid promos, runway, print), she had severe self image issues and she was beautiful, like 11 out of 10...very sad stuff and I guess most guys won't ever understand that aspect  and like jedi mentioned, that pic is horrible, lighting and pose are both awkward...  but she should get bonus points for being into fishing"
844023,T-Bone,2014-03-28 18:07:00,160,"I'm with HeadHunter...that's not even real, hence one of the reasons it looks so unappealing. Some 'stock' body shot with what appears to be a Polaroid of one of The Sun office assistants with a ball cap on. Maybe the emodel market is drying up. And agreed...a 4th grader can use Photoshop better than that. Does the media really believe we're that gullible?"
844025,Acountdeleted,2014-03-28 18:38:00,2562,"The Sun has always been 'creative' with their sunshine girls. I had a friend who was one once. Her blurb said she wanted to be a veterinarian and dreamed of going sky diving........ she hates animals and has a fear of heights.  After having a good laugh, she mentioned that they took a bunch of photos, paid her and asked her to leave. The blurbs are totally made up."
844030,BucktownAngler,2014-03-28 19:18:00,582,looks like misty's cafe material
844032,Renegade67,2014-03-28 19:32:00,86,"The pic does not look right.  Not into the button jewlery but at least she isn't covered head to toe in skanky ink.  But maybe that was shopped out as well! I must be getting old though, as the saying goes ""I would'nt throw her outa bed for eating crackers."""

844042,Joey,2014-03-28 20:27:00,9122,"I was a sunshine girl once, when I was pretty young.  That does totally look photo shopped and is very unflattering.  They can do wonders with the right setting, but that is a disaster.  As for the photographers, yup, they try their hardest to get  some ""private"" photos for themselves, but you have to stand strong, say no and keep yer clothes on."
844044,misfish,2014-03-28 21:12:00,29133,You could still be a sun shine girl  J.
844046,SirCranksalot,2014-03-28 21:27:00,3291,looking at that pic just makes me want to go fishing!
844052,Fisherman,2014-03-28 21:37:00,7201,"I must be getting old though, as the saying goes ""I would'nt throw her outa bed for eating crackers."" Some of you guys have some awful low standards.  Nature gave us two hands to hold utensils and other crafty ""tools""."
