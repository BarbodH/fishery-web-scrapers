The gang arrived pretty much before 9ish. Terry and I scouted the area . Found lots off fish,(on the screen) but very finicky.  Had set pike lines out and perch fished with our second rods.  Some dinks were caught,but for the amount we seen on all screens,it was a very very slow outing.  What ya going to do. It,s been along ice season. Fish are probly looking forward to open waters and warmer temps just like us anglers.  Maybe next year we can hit a productive perch area.  Some pics I took of the ones that made the show.  Burtess and his daughter Corey.    Ryan and his son,,,,,,dang,forgot his name. Sorry.     Terry and Naw.    The trio cast of grandkids.  Lil,shi and brec.    The kids enjoyed the man made live well.      Still a good time out.  Next year,we will do a perch G2G. LOL   Thanks to Burt for drilling up the holes,and Naw for the coffee and donuts for all.    "

844264,tb4me,2014-03-29 20:31:00,3295,Still looked like fun to me! Way to go .. By the looks of the man made live well pic that would explain why the pike weren't biting..
844304,NAW,2014-03-30 00:10:00,4022,"Hey, it's always nice to get out.  I think the highlight of the morning way Ryan's boy setting the hook on an ""ice pike"".  This kid has mad skills!  I have a picture if Terry praying for fish...  But photo buckets being weird..  Just a blank white screen, no matter what I do..."
844314,BillM,2014-03-30 01:17:00,17367,You boys were on the wrong end of the lake!     Looks like a great day to spend out on the ice.
844349,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-30 02:20:00,826,"Was a fun way to kill a couple hours . Caleb is still talking about the ""pike"" he lost , even more determined then ever to get one now. Nick, you gotta see the kid set the hook on a rainbow LOL.  R"

I pick that spot so it,s a short walk for everyone. Yes the kids made for some good laughs.  I was watching Caleb,and was hopeing that rod and hook didnt come flying up in your face Ry.LOL"
