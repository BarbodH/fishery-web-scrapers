I tried so many other shotguns and never found one as slick as that one. Anyhow I decided to pickup the new version the Winchester SXP Black Shadow in 3.5"" 12 gauge. Well I started doing the rounds on the internet looking for the best price... 499 @cabelas plus shipping, 419 @ Epps plus 40 in as round trip, 389 at Gagnon, surprise no stock after 30 minutes on the phone... Bass Pro no interest in checking prices after they lost my PAL the last time I went to go look at a gun, Gagnon's didn't have a new one in stock but did have a used one for 369.... Well I had settled on Epps as 420 seemed like a good deal, then I remembered to check with Sail. Well Sail has them for 369. Yah the same price as a used one from around the corner at Gagnon. Anyhow. I was happy to find that deal, called them up to confirm stock and they pulled one off the shelf for me(something Epps won't do unless you pre buy it over the phone). Anyhow, I was very happy to see that the gun has the same shouldered feel and with the inertia driven action I hope it shoots and pumps as smooth as my old speedpump. Yes I know its not the fanciest of pump guns out there, but I can tell you this compared dollar for dollar against the others its a fair more solid gun.  Anyhow just wanted to let you folks know to make sure you check Sail"

I had an old Stevens pump 12 ga many years ago, wasn't a fancy gun by a long shot but if it flew and I shot, it dropped! I ended up selling it when I moved to Toronto with the understanding that I could buy it back some day. Unfortunatly the fellow I sold it to passed away and one of his kids took it and I never saw it again. I did buy a Remmington 870 and it has served me well but that old Stevens and I were just made to fit!  Hope you really get a lot of use and enjoyment out of your new purchase!"
