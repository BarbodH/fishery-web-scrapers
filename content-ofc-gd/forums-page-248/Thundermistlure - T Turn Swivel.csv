844243,Afraz,2014-03-29 18:44:00,250,"Hello Folks,  I was looking to get a swivel that would allow me to run 2 baits/lures simultaneously without causing serious tangles. Based on what i have seen by EVO's t-turn, this product stops that from happening, is there anything else on the market that functions in a similar way where line twists / tangling is rectified by virtue of the connector design ?  Thanks"
