844182,bushart,2014-03-29 15:07:00,2628,K  Now that we live just outside Hooterville....we don't have a movie rental store nearby  So the wife and I are rentin via satellite now  Like last week we rented last Vegas---ok had some funny things  But here's the dilemma  3 heavies for choices 2nite  Tough call--really struggling with this choice  1.Out of The Furnace (my choice--could be violent for the missus??)  2. American Hustle---another Christian Bale??  3. Dallas Buyers club----trailer looks good  Opinions??
844184,BillM,2014-03-29 15:10:00,17367,Dallas Buyers Club is a great flick...
844185,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-29 15:12:00,2582,"Saw American Hustle with Debbe 2 weekends ago.  She thought it was OK, I won't recommend it. I like alot of the cast in it so I thought I would enjoy it but it did nothing for me.  Also NEVER EVER EVER see August Osage County...EVER. That was the most putrid show I ever sat in a theatre to watch."
844187,leaf4,2014-03-29 15:16:00,2466,"I would reccomend out of the furnace #1 Dallas buyers club #2, I wouldn't pay to see american hustle, don't know how it won awards, myself and everyone I know who's seen it did not enjoy it."
844188,cram,2014-03-29 15:16:00,1733,All is Lost is worth seeing if you haven't yet.  liked it better than Dallas Buyers CLub and American Hustle.  Haven't seen the other one.  Wolf of Wall Street and Prisoners are 2 more I'd recommend. 
844195,Big Cliff,2014-03-29 15:27:00,6899,Can't comment on your current choices but The Heat with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy was one that both Sue and I really enjoyed!
844196,bushart,2014-03-29 15:29:00,2628,Thanks guys---lots not liking American Hustle
844215,Musky or Specks,2014-03-29 16:45:00,2710,American Hustle is a character driven drama. If you enjoy watching great performances  without a whole lot of content to the story you will enjoy it particularly Bale and Adams. Think Silver Linings Playbook. That being said Dallas Buyers Club has both great acting and a very moving story and would be my personal recommendation.
844222,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-29 17:25:00,8243,"Have seen all 3. I really enjoyed American Hustle. Nothing to do with the dance, if you are old enough to remember the Abscam FBI dupe with artistic license, plenty of it.. Great performances all around. Dramatically shows the little difference between the psyche of the criminal and the cop, how little difference there is between the  two personalities required to do the job well.  Out of the Furnace is a close second, a little far fetched as the story line gets over the top, even for the psychotic mastermind Meth tweeker played by Woody Harrelson. Was busy pointing out the departments in a Steel mill, wife wanted to kill me.  Dallas buyers club is a great movie that I will enjoy better the second time around, like pasta the next day. Mathew McConickee (sic) . Doesn't play himself for the first time and earns himself an Oscar. New found respect for him as an actor, he showed this new side in True Detective as well last year.  As far as enjoyment it's a toss up with an American Hustle win in OT."
844225,bushart,2014-03-29 17:34:00,2628,Thanks Guys  Think tonite we'll do Out of The Furnace ---next watched will be Dallas Buyers club  Man..... and wolf of wall street after those----so many movies to catch up on

Wolf of Wall Street and Prisoners are 2 more I'd recommend.  Haven't seen any of your choices yet but All is Lost was a great film.
844228,lew,2014-03-29 17:41:00,12766,"I almost never watch movies simply because I don't have the patience to sit in front of the TV for 2 hours, but I did recently watch Captain Philips with Tom Hanks. Maybe not the best movie I've ever seen, but it was pretty interesting and based on a true story.  If it's still being shown on TV, I'd recommend it."
844229,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-29 17:52:00,8243,"I would reccomend out of the furnace #1 Dallas buyers club #2, I wouldn't pay to see american hustle, don't know how it won awards, myself and everyone I know who's seen it did not enjoy it.  No one you know was born when this all happened leaf4. It was nostalgic for me, all through the movie, hey honey I had that car, I had the same suit, I remember that song Chic by LeChic, shut up please Mr. Travolta I'm trying to watch the movie. What I remember best is the young girls were falling out of their Disco dresses like Amy Adams', oh the good old days, where's my 8 track of Disco Inferno? Burn baby burn."
844231,Headhunter,2014-03-29 17:53:00,5703,"If you haven't seen ""The Butler"", I highly recommend it. HH"

844400,bushart,2014-03-30 13:48:00,2628,K  Out of The Furnace was really good  Even the wife was glued to it  Did'nt realize it was a Ridley Scott movie------prob why it was good  Dallas BC next  Thanks Guys
