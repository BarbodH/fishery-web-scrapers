FYI, they also sell stove oil and dyed diessel as well.  The problem is they have been sold out since the ice storm and do not expect to have more for at least 3 weeks.  [Most stores carry it for about $25 for 9.88L which is $2.53 per litre.]  I only need about 10 L, and my father in-law needs about 25 L.  Does anyone know of another place to buy it cheap in either Durham Region or the Lindsay area?  Thanks,  Entropy"
833100,GBW,2014-01-28 02:54:00,8460,good luck and I hope this helps.  http://www.canpages.ca/business/ON/oshawa/kerosene/3557-448100.html
833103,irishfield,2014-01-28 03:02:00,26272,Probably the best you're gonna find without a bulk filling station.. there's a TSC in Lindsay on the back street that cuts the corner off behind the Ford dealership  http://www.tscstores.com/189L-CLEAR-KEROSENE-P12718.aspx  Works out to 2.33 a litre with them on sale 20% off right now.  25 + 10 = 35.. these are 18.9 litre cans so two would cover you.  Of course you might wanna call and check stock first....

I emailed Durham Fuels, and the told me to try Lambert Oil.     Most of the listings are just gas stations, or fuel oil for home heating, that sort of thing.  Thanks about the TSC sale, might check that out.  Entropy"
833280,Freshtrax,2014-01-29 01:12:00,2215,What's it for? If its for a shop heater just burn diesel in it.
833337,Entropy,2014-01-29 11:23:00,747,"For a wick fed kero heater in the garage and emergency in the house.  Also, oil lamps."
833396,Freshtrax,2014-01-29 17:31:00,2215,"It wil burn , obviously kero is the best choice. But desiel l work if you have no other choice."
843507,Entropy,2014-03-26 00:53:00,747,Just an FYI.  Lambert Oil is back up and running.  I stopped in today and bought about 9 L of Kerosene for about $15.  That's about half of what it costs to buy it from a store.  Entropy
