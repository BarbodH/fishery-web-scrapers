Which also means that I will have some evenings to burn. My guess is that its still ice fishing season up there. I also know it lies on a river so maybe thats open to some casting? Any tips at all that a local or someone with some knowledge could recommend I would greatly appreciate it. Feel free to PM or just reply here."

1043163,Cosmos,2019-04-16 18:50:00,588,I was in Kapuskasing last Wednesday. It was -15 C and  snow. Didn't see anyone fishing - people spend more time snowmobiling i guess. Saw at least 100 snowmobiles. River was open in the town so you might be able to cast if season is open. Good luck
1043164,Joeytier,2019-04-16 19:00:00,3990,"Go on fish online and find some splake and bow lakes that you can access by foot.  The ice will be on the way out out but likely fishable.  I was drilling thru 30"" and sledding on 2.5 feet of snow today, and I'm well south of kap."
1043201,AKRISONER,2019-04-17 12:35:00,5558,thanks for the tips guys...it really sounds like I will most likely be ice fishing. Which is kinda cool to be honest. I cant remember the last time I ice fished in May. Probably since I lived in Manitoba.
1043241,chris.brock,2019-04-17 23:55:00,4053,"Not to be bummer, but I think the area is kind of poor. There's 8k people in Kap but not many lakes in the area to disperse the pressure. Ice fishing in May is cool though, post some pics if it happens. "
1043262,AKRISONER,2019-04-18 13:29:00,5558,"we shall see! supposed to be pretty darn warm, even up there over the next little bit so Im not so sure I would want to venture out on ice that I dont know at all. May try and cast the river somewhere and see what happens."
1043920,lickmyarmpit,2019-05-02 20:43:00,359,There's lots of fishing to be had water that isn't ice is high so be careful. I'll shoot you a PM cause I heard the fishing isn't very good and I don't wanna give up my spots....
