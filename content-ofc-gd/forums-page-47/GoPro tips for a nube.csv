1043476,kickingfrog,2019-04-23 00:59:00,8333,How is that affixed to the ball hat?
1043485,Gil Levesque,2019-04-23 11:19:00,103,"Very simple frog, drill a 1/4 "" hole through the plastic brim. Then use a short bolt. I used a  plastic head knurled bolt, washer And a lock ring from a camera mount on top! Screw ur mount up snug and ur done! I keep my camera in car mode! With an inline swtch on usb cable. Camera records when u give it power! (starting ur car!!!!) cheers  "
1043567,Alan from Texas,2019-04-24 19:52:00,4,Or you can buy a GoPro ready hat with the mounting screw that goes on the underside of the hat brim at Amazon.

1043656,smithy97,2019-04-26 17:38:00,70,"I just did my first youtube video, I edited it with Shotcut. You can download it for free. Lots of great tutorials on how to use it. I'm a newbie and I got thru it! I wanted to use the preinstalled windows movie maker on windows 10 but it would not export anything I edited, so I tried Shotcut and loved it."
1043657,bobowski,2019-04-26 17:50:00,360,Awesome. Ya I've heard of shotcut. I will give it a try. Thanks a lot bud.
1042649,kickingfrog,2019-04-07 21:36:00,8333,"Just got my first GoPro. It came with a floating handle and a head mount. I plan on getting an adaptor for my tripod and a glass mount. What other accessories have the collective found useful, or useless? I'll use it while fishing and hunting and figured the head mount might work for that but I have seen others use a gun mount."
1042661,BillM,2019-04-08 02:39:00,17367,"Make sure you've got a Class 10+ or better SD card.  I run a 256gb in mine.  Never worry about running out of recording space.   I like suction cup mounts for the boat.  One on the windshield, one on the main."
1042666,singingdog,2019-04-08 11:27:00,1047,"Sell it and get some really good tackle or hunting accessories. Seriously, GoPros are an epidemic.....we aren't that interesting ?"
1042667,LeXXington,2019-04-08 13:27:00,1928,"extra batteries,  the RAM mount is nice but expensive"
1042671,mamona,2019-04-08 14:06:00,597,"+1 for extra batteries, GoPro suffers from battery performance. The dual battery charger will save you time. 	Other than that everything depends on how you are planning to use it. GorillaPod Action Tripod will let you place the camera almost anywhere. 	Tip: you can save lots of money by buying third-party accessories. There is plenty of them on Amazon for example. "
1042680,Lape0019,2019-04-08 15:56:00,647,"First off, I agree with singingdog LOL. But, if you plan on using this on your boat most often, I would recommend looking at something like this instead of multiple batteries.  https://yolotek.com/collections/gopro-boat-mount"
1042824,Raycaster,2019-04-10 20:57:00,528,"Learn how to use the ""looping"" mode recording and have backup batteries. Don't get excited about 4k, a lot of time 720 at 240fps may provide better action video for editing. Be ready for fog and rain preparing for condensation problems. Put a usb connector in your boat (2.1A if possible) Get ready for abuse from the veteran fishermen!  "
1042826,misfish,2019-04-10 21:36:00,29133,"I make my own adapters Rob. As you know,not many areas to just screw on a holder. LOL The stick on adaptors that go pro uses, is very strong. Once you put it on something,it aint coming off. I use the session 5. So cant comment on the go pro camera you have, but I can tell ya that voice command, not all it,s cracked up to be, and sucks the battery life. Also dosent work half the time or cuts out.  Enjoy the fun.  And don't forget, you tube is your friend for figuring out trouble shooting. Helped me a ton."
1042978,kickingfrog,2019-04-13 16:17:00,8333,Never thought about using the suction mount on the boat.
1042979,kickingfrog,2019-04-13 16:20:00,8333,"I would have tossed the ""stickers"" because I didn't think they would hold."
1042991,kickingfrog,2019-04-13 22:35:00,8333,Started using it today to figure my way around it…. I'll soon be loading several minutes of changing tires and playing catch with my son.
1043074,limeyangler,2019-04-15 11:46:00,5204,Which Gopro did you get? 
1043088,Lape0019,2019-04-15 15:42:00,647,"Just an FYI, My old fishing partner has lost two using those suction mounts. As stated, those taped mounts hold strong. That 3M adhesive is insane."
1043185,kickingfrog,2019-04-17 02:02:00,8333,Seven
1043194,Yellow Fever,2019-04-17 10:52:00,139,"I have 3 on my boat and use them all the time, i take people out and post their catches. Also i have friends around the world that i fished with at one time and it's a way to still fish with them. I do look back on the catches . I could care less what others think about my channel."
1043215,misfish,2019-04-17 15:41:00,29133,EXACTLY
1043219,msp,2019-04-17 17:57:00,1336,I would love to have a go pro with the yolo stick. Looks like fun but I am useless when it comes to tech stuff. I would never be able to edit
1043223,Jon,2019-04-17 18:37:00,209,"I'm not sure exactly what your intended use is - filming yourself, others, above or below water but here are a few things I use. The clamp can be handy along a stream or in the woods but for a boat, a permanent mount may be better. For underwater stuff, I use a RAM adaptor with an Ettore painters pole. If you want to get fancy photos, try an over/under dome attachment. I have the Telesin model but it looks like there is some competition out there and I assume there is one for the newer GoPros. RAM Pole Adaptor Telesin Dome Port (Hero5) An extra battery and the double charger is handy. A chest strap or sportsman's mount may also be good depending on your needs. Have fun with the new toy! Jon "
1043238,misfish,2019-04-17 22:39:00,29133,"Im an idiot,and seem to manage. LOL Lucky to still have the windows 2012 movie maker.  Thanks to a couple of ghost chasers."
1043251,Yellow Fever,2019-04-18 11:16:00,139,"Just experiment with it, my videos are pretty lame...no edit and no sound (which is a good thing) camera rolls when we get a fish on..."
1043301,Gil Levesque,2019-04-19 12:20:00,103,"I mount my camera on the visor of a ball cap! Its always pointed where your looking, its out of the way, and  so light u never even know its there! In my boat i plug it into a usb power port with a longer cable (10')if im moving around. Works awsome!! "
1043312,misfish,2019-04-19 16:16:00,29133,I thought my fly material was a mess. But I know where everything is. Sorta. LOL  
1043316,Gil Levesque,2019-04-19 17:34:00,103,I tidy it up when i cant find stuff anymore!!!! Lol!

1043462,bobowski,2019-04-22 21:01:00,360,What software are you guys using to edit your GoPro footage?
