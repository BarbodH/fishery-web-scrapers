1043876,jimmer,2019-05-01 20:06:00,2730,This is why I get so pissed off when people whip by me (while I'm fishing) within 10 - 20 yards at full throttle.  That's how easy it can happen and then take out innocent boats in the vicinity.
1043880,misfish,2019-05-01 23:59:00,29133,Back at ya.
1043881,Whitespinnerbait,2019-05-02 00:09:00,2038,Mercury sells a 400 hp so you can go fast.!!! They bought a 400hp to go Fast !!
1043883,Fisherman,2019-05-02 01:21:00,7201,More HP than brains.
1043890,AKRISONER,2019-05-02 03:27:00,5558,Even if they had 400 of their brains combined I don’t think they would have any sense
1043924,David Chong,2019-05-02 21:25:00,836,We don't need to go that fast! My boat runs in the 70's and that is plenty fast! Things happen real fast at those speeds! Scary stuff!
1043926,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-02 21:31:00,10439,My friends dad used to race drag boats. It was a 19' ski boat hull with a 458 ci big block Ford with a vee drive. Ran the 1/4 mile @ 115 MPH. He flipped it once but his parachute pulled him out of the boat as it blew over. Ended up with over 100 stitches down one leg that got torn up on the gunnel as he was getting yanked out by the chute. Gotta have nerves of steel to run those things.
1043929,Fisherman,2019-05-03 00:34:00,7201,I would call it something else but I don't want to give vegetables a bad name.
1043798,DRIFTER_016,2019-04-30 19:36:00,10439,DAYUM!!!  Surprised they had no injuries.  
1043800,TJQ,2019-04-30 19:56:00,7806,Too fast for me.....
1043801,DRIFTER_016,2019-04-30 20:05:00,10439,I've gone 80 in a buddies boat back when I was young and invincible. I'm old and brittle now sooooooo.............................
1043802,dave524,2019-04-30 20:08:00,4508,"Totally insane on a public waterway. Anything over possibly 80 kph or 50 mph should not be allowed on a public waterway only on a closed course racetrack. Same as our roadways, want to race, take it to a track.  edit: same with snowmobiles"
1043803,Terry,2019-04-30 20:15:00,14456,Yeah once you hit 70 miles an hour things can go bad real quick anything over that is just crazy
1043804,misfish,2019-04-30 20:21:00,29133,3 mph on my toon is fast enough for me.
1043806,BillM,2019-04-30 21:55:00,17367,"Almost Darwin, almost!"
1043808,misfish,2019-04-30 23:00:00,29133,"Are you saying, boarder line ?  LOL"
1043809,ecmilley,2019-04-30 23:29:00,2163,I would try it. Lol but anything over 250hp no good for most tournaments I do
1043815,dave524,2019-04-30 23:53:00,4508,I'm dating myself but I remember the early 80's when the pro BASS circuit was limited to 150 horse.
1043816,Terry,2019-05-01 00:01:00,14456,I think it was round 1990 around here they lifted the 150 hp limit
1043819,woodenboater,2019-05-01 00:25:00,2277,"just cuz you can, doesn't mean you should. definitely darwin candidates."
1043820,Fisherman,2019-05-01 00:32:00,7201,"A comment like ""we can laugh about it"" tells me everything I need to know."
1043821,OhioFisherman,2019-05-01 00:40:00,6623,"Seemed like a decent boat, you must have easy money to think losing it was worth taking a chance on losing it?"
1043822,glen,2019-05-01 01:00:00,2641,That will buff right out.
1043826,OhioFisherman,2019-05-01 02:33:00,6623,"http://www.cleveland19.com/2019/04/30/garbage-truck-stuck-between-bridge-overpass-i-/ Another ouch, trucks, about a mile from where I grew up, walked and rode my bike across that foot bridge many times."
1043828,bassman87,2019-05-01 03:07:00,586,ouchies
1043831,OhioFisherman,2019-05-01 04:03:00,6623,"As I saw on another news channel that guy broke 10 ribs, can't recall exactly but that street had a 25 or 35 mph speed limit, a good thing he wasn't on the highway doing 55 mph! There was another one of those foot bridges on the Cleveland shoreway that connects I 90 to I 77 and I 71, a few years back a truck hit it and created a traffic nightmare because he destroyed it."
1043832,AKRISONER,2019-05-01 04:04:00,5558,"Watching him battle that chine walk the whole video was giving me anxiety. ive gone 70mph as a passenger in a triton...what was even scarier was that we were doing it on lake Marion with trees flying past us the whole time hahaha. My boat does 55mph but doesn’t walk, even that scares me though, you feel like you can’t do much but just hold on while the boat is flying through the air barely touching the water. My normal 45 cruising speed is plenty good enough for me"
1043833,Old Ironmaker,2019-05-01 04:04:00,8243,First I have to say that those guys had someone watching their backs otherwise they should be dead. Now I'll say they are idiots and deserved to lose the boat. The dump truck incident happened regularly at the plant. Drivers would leave the box up and drive away. Once a guy hit a high pressure natural gas and oxygen line and split them in half. That was fun. I suggested a limit switch be installed so when a driver puts his rig in drive with the box up a device would protrude from under his seat and insert into an area of the body where nothing should be inserted. They won't do it again. Some may recall a few years ago when a driver hit the upper span of the Skyway Bridge in Hamilton with the box up doing 100K. Shut the bridge down for over a week. Another idiot.
1043851,DRIFTER_016,2019-05-01 14:58:00,10439,Saw one of those on Heavy Rescue 401 last season. ?
1043853,LeXXington,2019-05-01 15:08:00,1928,Series of mistakes that could have been avoided....  oh you mean going that fast lol
1043854,mamona,2019-05-01 15:13:00,597,Incredible how boat did not survive but those guys did.
1043856,Squid,2019-05-01 15:42:00,1656,This is just for guys with physical limitations lol.
1043860,OhioFisherman,2019-05-01 15:57:00,6623,"Says a bit about the driver shortage here to me if you have a 76 year old guy driving your truck? I know some older people still get around well, but..."
