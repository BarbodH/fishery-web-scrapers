1043893,BillM,2019-05-02 09:56:00,17367,"Heavy jig heads, 3/4oz, etc..  Staying vertical is key.  Goodluck!"
1043897,bigugli,2019-05-02 10:53:00,6138,"O was going to suggest going to Windsor, launch from the public ramp at LaSalle. 3/4 to 1 1/2 jigs with a minnow type plastic or twister vertical jigged. If water is chocolate, bring a plan ""b"" for shoreline and basin pannie fishing."
1043900,Woodsman,2019-05-02 13:40:00,1286,Lake Huron was pretty rough for a few days. Water in the river at Sarnia may be stained up.
1043902,Thrilla,2019-05-02 15:56:00,164,"There are clean areas in the river and it doesn’t take long to clean up. Having said that we went Tuesday and it was completely trashed. On the south end near Walpole. Don’t fish Sarnia much but lower/mid river we’ve been getting them 25-40 fow. 3/4 oz jig green minnow plastics, stay vertical, use a stinger hook drop slow good luck lots of fish in the river"
1043906,Garnet,2019-05-02 16:42:00,2056,"I stay away from action tails , curly and shad tails. Light braid 10lb mostly strait braid. And look for clear water."
1044055,Freshtrax,2019-05-06 15:22:00,2215,"Well was nice to feel the sun on my face after a long winter.   We managed 5 nice 17 inch walleye,   once we got the hang of it.   Cool place to fish. new ipilot got a nice workout for the first time and did admirably keeping us pionted in the right direction and the right speed. Autopilot works even when your moving backwards:) I bet you could lay a beating on them here if you knew what you were doing.     "
1044089,captpierre,2019-05-07 02:14:00,2521,So. Enlighten me. These walleyes in the St Clair and Detroit Rivers - are they out of Erie and Lake St Clair spawning there?
1044104,Thrilla,2019-05-07 10:34:00,164,"Detroit river will have fish from erie and st clair SCR will have fish from lake st clair and Huron Got my limit in 45 min last night after work, perfect quick trip before the rain started!"
1044269,b_cdot,2019-05-10 17:03:00,270,"You'd be surprised how much the fish in these waterways travel, there is many fish in the Saint Clair river that will be out in Erie later this year and there's many fish in the Detroit river that will be up in Huron. They don't have shock collars on keeping them in certain lakes. There is so many different migrations of fish moving through the system and there is an abundant amount of fish in the system right now."
