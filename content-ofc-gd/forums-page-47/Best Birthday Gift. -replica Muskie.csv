1043965,captpierre,2019-05-03 21:38:00,2521,Couldn’t be happier with what the kids got for my 60th. Thanks Guys! Advanced Taxidermy made a replica of my biggest ski. Caught in 2005 on Scugog. 52 inches. Based on measurement and photo. Hanging at the cottage now. BTW I posted an add to rent our cottage this summer if anyone is interested. 3 wks.  Under miscellaneous.

1043988,Mike Pike,2019-05-04 15:46:00,1332,"I couldn't imagine receiving a nicer gift!  Congratulations on your fish and your milestone, Capt!"
1044009,OhioFisherman,2019-05-05 02:03:00,6623,Nice mount!
1044015,captpierre,2019-05-05 12:12:00,2521,Found the original pic from 2005. 
1044016,lew,2019-05-05 12:20:00,12766,"That's a nice picture of the fish and 52"" out of Scugog is pretty rare so it's really something to be proud of."
1044017,porkpie,2019-05-05 13:48:00,2521,Very nice mount!!
1044027,captpierre,2019-05-05 19:16:00,2521,"Thanks.  Just got lucky, Lew.  Trolling the channel off Cesarea using a Stalker. Caught 3 fish that evening over 45 in. Must have been the right moon. The challenge was safely landing and releasing the big girl. She swam away nicely. Hope she survived. Was September. The water wasn’t too warm."
1044029,lew,2019-05-05 19:29:00,12766,3 over 45 in an evening is good fishing in anybody's books....well done for sure !!
1044045,AKRISONER,2019-05-06 13:35:00,5558,why anyone would not just get a replica made is beyond me these days. They look incredible and stand up to the test of time as well. What a fish out of the kawarthas too hot dang!
1044051,jimmer,2019-05-06 14:21:00,2730,Nice looking ski.  Always liked the colouring of the muskie in Scugog. Shawn and James do a great job on the replicas!
1044101,Chuck Enwinde,2019-05-07 05:07:00,247,Nobody's that lucky captpierre.  Though your second pic calls that assumption in to question.
1044151,David Chong,2019-05-08 12:40:00,836,Beautiful fish and another amazing mount by the folks at Advanced Taxidermy!
