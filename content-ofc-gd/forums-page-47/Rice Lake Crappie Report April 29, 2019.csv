1043963,Musky Plug,2019-05-03 21:15:00,398,Sweet vid. Looks like you guys had a productive day!
1043969,Taro,2019-05-03 22:34:00,16,The weather has a played a role for sure. There should be a big bite once the weather stabilizes more.
1043974,206,2019-05-04 00:23:00,563,"""I am the crap eater!"" lmao Looks like you had fun, water temps so low they are still deep yesterday, only been out 2 times over a week apart and fish still staging waiting for the water to warm. Look for minnows busting the surface toss your float to them and you'll get bit, Rice is full of decent crappie. my daughter last week "
