Sunday morning Kawartha lakes was a little chilly headed out in 42-3f water temp wind outta the north in search of crappies so checked my first course spots fish were there but no takers water was 43-44f in canal try later in afternoon so onto 2nd spot no fish 3 Rd spot lots of bait again cold water no movement of anything tryed. A 4th spot  water was now into 47-8f area game on immediately started sticking fish as the wind also shifted to a blow out of the west . We didn't get any giants but had great average boating over 120 crappies kept those st Croix rods bent all afternoon with strike king and Northland baits being main ticket
