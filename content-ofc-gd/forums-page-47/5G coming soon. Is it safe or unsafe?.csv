They have 250,000 customer out of the gate and the first phones launch May 10th. For Canada, 4G service makes so much more sense since low frequencies travel further than high frequencies. as such we're likely to be saturating 4G LTE everywhere for a while before 5G mini-cells start replacing them for most usage. In the cities, who knows. I think we're gonna see it at stadiums and malls just because of the performance. I thought it might be good mention that your 5G router is a very likely 5Ghz router which is different than 5G wireless technology. Most home wifi is 802.11ac which is 5Ghz and has been around since about 2013. The routers that use the 5G technology that we are worried about use the 60Ghz spectrum, but have only been around 6-8 months at the consumer level. This is 'WiGig' or 802.11ad. These are available in the 350-500 dollar price range but it's good to keep in mind that 60Ghz wifi won't bi-sect a wall. It's wave form won't penetrate a wall. The 5G devices that might be used could be higher or lower than 60Ghz, I think they are looking at 24-40Ghz stuff but I'm a network guy not a cellular phone expert. To some extent, the answer to getting away from Bell's 5G might be to go inside your house.

My wireless access points at the college I work for are dual band to help with congestion. We have 7 floors of apartments above us and because of that our top (3rd) floor suffers from a lot of congestion from all the wireless devices used in the apartments. 5G on that floor is more reliable as a result.

1044011,smitty55,2019-05-05 02:12:00,928,"I guess it depends on how you look at it Dave. Many of the dual band routers are MIMO which means that you get to use more devices at a time without loss of signal, so effectively giving you more bandwidth to use. Plus the lower speed is best for going thru walls for wifi so the net result is more usable bandwidth. I get what you said about only one frequency at a time but the newer standards like WiFi6 and 802.11 AX allow the use of both frequencies at the same time. I did debate using the word ""is"" when I typed it. The premise of my statement was that with a dual band router you have way more available bandwidth, and I still stand by that. I'll leave it with this from LinkSys on the pros of dual band routers. Cheers"

""Ionization"" is a process by which electrons are stripped from atoms and molecules.  This process can produce molecular changes that can lead to damage in biological tissue, including effects on DNA, the genetic material of living organisms.  This process requires interaction with high levels of electromagnetic energy.  Those types of electromagnetic radiation with enough energy to ionize biological material include X-radiation and gamma radiation.  Therefore, X-rays and gamma rays are examples of ionizing radiation. The energy levels associated with RF and microwave radiation, on the other hand, are not great enough to cause the ionization of atoms and molecules, and RF energy is, therefore, is a type of non-ionizing radiation.  Other types of non-ionizing radiation include visible and infrared light.  Often the term ""radiation"" is used, colloquially, to imply that ionizing radiation (radioactivity), such as that associated with nuclear power plants, is present.  Ionizing radiation should not be confused with the lower-energy, non-ionizing radiation with respect to possible biological effects, since the mechanisms of action are quite different. (Back to Index)  "

You are saying it is of no concern to you yet haven't come up with any links that provide more than opinion from its promoters. What 5G radiation effects on flora and fauna has been done? Seriously Colin. I would like to review some of this. OK then Colin (hope yours is healthy after 5G BTW) haha..... then why is it that Brussels, Israel and looks like Australia maybe soon doesn't want it yet? Why Colin? And why is one of the above having 20 engineers developing a 5G 'cloud' to give it to a neighboring jurisdiction that they oppose? Why Colin? This really makes me wonder if the stuff has an effect we may not like. My guess is these places want to have research that supports that it is safe before they accept it. I think that's smart. Oh and if you are right re the website thing, why would anyone do this unless there were concerns? Everything is comprised of electrons and such. Some things are very delicate. Shake em up and who knows? Let's do proper research before the shaking starts is what many are saying Colin. If you think it is not needed then fine. Have a nice day. Nice to hear your personal opinion. Honestly I  have to chuckle when you seem to be saying that until electrons are stripped (ionized) from atoms and molecules all is OK.

A lot of businesses are screaming that the outlying areas do not have fast enough internet to support business applications as well as streaming videos. This makes work both faster and easier if you can download a file in minutes instead of hours.   The opting out of Florida means it will not be available to them not that they do not want it. Evolution comes in two forms physical and mental. The physical aspect is hard to speed up but the mental abilities can be sped up as fast as the situation demands. In the beginning it is a learned response one that says today is to hot I will spray water on myself or go swimming. The evolutionary aspect is our hair thinned out and our sweat glands became more active. I didn't say our bodies should speed up for technology I said it will speed up for physical difficulties we make happen in the environment we live in. Funny thing is we are changing our DNA and the way it combats issues. An example is the increase of solar radiation ergo we now produce more melanin. I will say this is all long term things that our bodies will take many generations to compensate for these things. Most of my views are based on a philosophy of ""what does not kill me  will make me stronger"" to a rational extent.  Excessive fear of changes that are going to happen no matter what you believe or do are just a way too cause stress in ones life. Just a few random thoughts Art"
1043696,cisco,2019-04-28 00:04:00,597,"Sorry Art but you are mistaken on many fronts, random or no. In general, biology doesn't support that we are strengthening due to environmental 'hazards' Art. In fact the opposite is happening. Few examples.... Due to such things as antibiotics and insulin many humans that would otherwise have died are having offspring to pass along their weaknesses. Also there's the 'junk' food and deadly drugs now that cause obesity and health-related effects along with addictions and resultant death. A major killer in your country is opiods and fentanyl (sp?) that Trump is getting China to stop making/shipping since it is killing so many people. Our intellectual ability to develop protection to new technology-related health effects has limits also. Lead vests and exposure monitors while working with Xray and radiation generating equipment and the like. But there the effects were determined the hard way with many deaths. The same learning curve shouldn't be allowed with 5G. Nobody should support a new technology as 5G until proper long-term research is carried out. Oh and i recall folks in the rurals wanting cable for internet since bell was slow. That was when they knew it was faster with cable in the city. The 5G apparently won't work for the rurals since the distance between devices is too great. That's why Drifter is happy to plan on living in the bush out of reach of it. haha!  Sure people will want something faster. But that is the sales trick. If people weren't told that they would stay with the stuff that over the past 10 years only has sped up in leaps and bounds. People also want to go faster on the highway. Cars are safer, better brakes and tires and better able to withstand high speeds yet gov't keeps speed limits the same. Same cautionary approach should be used in considering 5G IMHO."

Frankly, some of the irrational/close-minded and weird responses have been unlike anything I've experienced here before. Easy to assume it is coincidence, but also a possibility that G devices are getting placed for too long and too close to cranial regions. Other possibly bad issues may ensue since 5G will apparently enable tracking of users. So if you have an FAC/PAL or other form of firearm permit you can more easily be found. I personally dislike that Google and such track what we look at and hit us with ads trying to take advantage. Privacy is being lost very quickly. Sure it's good to know what pedophiles and such are up to, but 'big brother' is becoming more apparent all the time and I don't like eavesdropping.

The scariest thing is that some think that population control will be necessary and that the 'elite' , whoever they are, could increase the Gs to literally kill people en mass. Due to Washington aggression in the world the doomsday clock is closest to midnight according to some. Right now the economies here and in the US are in shambles with foreign debt. If civil disobedience takes hold then what easier/better way to address this than by ramping up the Gs. I'm old but see that the middle class is being destroyed by regs/taxation/income reduction through inflation. 1% will have the $ and power and the rest will become unhappy poppers. To control unrest the poppers need be dumbed down and controlled. People are becoming dumber and if 5Gs is the start of pop'n control and brain alterations (again, except in Florida, Israel and Brussles) then this is a relatively easy way to get the evil result. Right now several countries are in uprising over the flooding of immigrants and raising of taxes. The yellow vest thing in France, the Brexit in Britain, and so forth are what will have to happen here if taxes and wages continue the way they are. In the US the 2 party system should have opposition to many things, but instead the Dems are supporting the Repubs on everything whether it be the huge increase in military budget or the attempted coupe in Venezuela. The 'Russia collusion' thing which MSM is continuing is just a smokescreen to fill MSM with nonsense to not cover the issues people need to know about. Instant gratification devices like hand-held computers distract and dumb down the masses into complacency. There. A bunch more stuff to go after me on.

It doesn't look too bright right now and I do not trust that gov't nor corporations nor global banksters 'have our best interests at heart'.   To me and from what I've read 5G may be good in many ways but to be sure is also continuation of a control mechanism.

Some scientists say in 3-5 generations women won't be able to have offspring due to DNA alterations. Brussels (world banking headquarters), Israel, and Trumps place (Marla Lago in Florida) isn't allowing it yet its being pushed fast and hard everywhere else it seems. This stuff will be all over pretty soon. They need to install the devices very close to us due to the short range of it. No government research has been done on effects. Gov't is trusting the seller and the seller is clearly stating in its literature/sales crap it is a form of pollution yet is also claiming no liability for any negative effects.  $ is the goal of the telecom industry and here's some scientific perspectives on it from a guy trying to get a local government to be cautious. Many Youtube articles on it so I thought to pass the issue along since most here are caring types.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljLynbr5iPc"

We cook in the soya and corn oil. That fertilizer tuff smells wicked. If you have ever had to drive behind a truck carrying it you will know what I mean. I have turned around when driving behind those trucks. No epidemiological studies have yet to be done, same for 5G I would guess."

MSM bombards us with stuff all around the world so we lose focus on issues we could possibly change for the better. This 5G is microwave radiation. The stuff that causes water to boil. A wee bit of boiling inside your brain or DNA may not be as apparent as that to a honey bee, but it should be researched before a go ahead is given. Also, sure many research reports contradict other research reports, but that doesn't justify having no research done.  I'd like to see university/gov't research on the matter.  Then it should be up to the public to decide if the negatives are worth the positives. It shouldn't be up to big business or its gov't puppets while the public is kept in the dark. 5G needs close proximity transmitters to work. So a municipality could say no to them until proper research is done to address concerns at least.   Like I said why has Israel, Brussels and Florida where Trump's family hangs out said no? What do they know that we don't? "

1043661,aplumma,2019-04-26 21:29:00,6896, One of the things that drive evolution is that the environmental surroundings change.  The ability to negate its impact on humanity is driving evolution either of our physical ability to cope or our intellectual ability to overcome.  Consider sunburning. An albino which is a recessed gene will burn in no time in the sun where as  a person who has a more modern or advanced gene will tan. This said for modern man to enjoy what he has created and use the advancements that his intellect has created we must then catch up in our physical mutation to it.  It is not that big business is advancing  this for their own reason rather it is the consumer who wants a bigger better faster product. Big business recognized that it can be lucrative and that they have the resources to make this on a large scale. If a mom and pop company produced a 5g network that covered 200 miles it would fail. Now if they banded together and each provided a network.......... o wait that would make them big business. So the real answer is if consumers do not demand something  then business will not provide a service that would fail due to a lack of demand. Art
1043671,cisco,2019-04-27 07:32:00,597,"Completely disagree. Consumer demand isn't screaming for faster service. The biz is creating it and forcefully selling it for profit using this excuse. Profit and control. Period. I just received a second letter from Rogers saying how I must buy new stuff since my old stuff isn't 5G. End of next year i recall was the deadline.... tossed it. Are the people in Israel, Brussels, Florida not screaming for it? They have opted out. You would expect that these areas would be more in need for any 'faster' service. It is totally wrong to even suggest that mankind must adapt our bodies to keep up with developing technology. This is totally backwards thinking. The whole idea of basically, any invention, is to save labor/make things more convenient and helpful. To introduce 5G and say people should adapt their bodies to it is kinda crazy. Evolution takes a bit of time and it is impossible for mankind to suddenly be able to shield its DNA and cell structure from microwave radiation. I do agree with the 'albino' weakness aspect though. Some people will be more affected by 5G than others. Some ages/weaknesses will have different sensitivities.  But when all is installed and running and then, if people start getting headaches and such, then there's no turning back. Corp lawyers and bought politicians will fight against the affected who will have to prove 5G is harming them. So the sick will have to pay for research to try and get a paid-for gov't to turn it off. All of this is completely backwards to how mankind should be 'progressing' with a new technology. First it must be proven safe. Then go from there peddling it."
1043675,colin519,2019-04-27 12:43:00,101,"You’re gonna be fine. That chart doesn’t separate ‘microwave’ and ‘radio waves’ because it’s all the same. All of this is considered non-ionizing radiation. This means it will only produce thermal resonance in a cell, or change electron valence. Ionizing radiation will destabilize at atom entirely (X-ray, gamma rays, UV rays). The World Health organization 10 years ago ratified the WiGig standard and concluded these spectrums only produce non-ionizing radiation which affects tissue by less than 1 degree C. This means it was impossible to measure any effect. Without knowing to ask for it, you are worried about whether non-ionizing radiation has unknown effects on tissue. This is the same thing Belgium, Florida are suggesting. The answer is you shouldn’t worry about it. You’re afraid of something you don’t understand. (So am I but nothing to do but read about it!) There’s 40 years of MRI, CTs, Xrays, more time than that with radio and radiation. The engineers who make this stuff understand it, test it and bring it to market. Even if there is more research to be done, the fact you jump to some corporate/government scheme because of the information that you’ve presented is just not an effective way to respond. You really think these engineers are building stuff to melt their customers from the inside? Also, be sure to remember that you now desire more government oversight, more interference in the private sector. An article or video without adequate data is just fear mongering. A video of a politician with their mouth moving is the least reputable form of evidence I can imagine. Edited to add, thank you for posting this stuff though. I like the discussion and hopefully I’ll be slightly less dickish in the future."

I'm not worried about 'tissue' per se, I'm worried about DNA alterations.  I have only read/seen videos and am not an expert, but neither is anyone here. Some experts are concerned that within 3 to 5 generations women exposed to 5G won't bear offspring. Well, except for places 5G hasn't been operating. So good research would be to expose a fast multiplier (daphnia say) to see if any effects appear down the road a few generations. I do believe engineers build stuff for profit of corporations. Enough said. Gov't oversight is vital to protect people from unscrupulous corporation execs that are profit driven. The food we eat and cars we drive are examples where we don't want DDT that thins eagle egg shells, or cars without safety standards on the roads or drivers with no training. Saying it's 'safe' technology is as wrong as saying it is 'unsafe' technology at this point without proper research. Proper research that seems quite absent at this point unfortunately. Doesn't the atmosphere shield us from these wavelengths? I read where this is the case and with 5G this shielding is obviously bypassed. Again, if we are shielded from it then is it a good idea to bypass this? I know the ozone layer is a worry if lost. Haha! OK I edited to add I don't consider you 'dickish' since when people get emotionally involved with an issue even for no reason they get a bit that way.?"

One of the big ones that runs the wee ones along the pole line.  This to prevent any of your neighbors from 'falsely' claiming it is harming them. You can defend the company with ""We're OK so those folks must be just imagining things!""   I imagine the rest of the family would be on side with no worries. "
