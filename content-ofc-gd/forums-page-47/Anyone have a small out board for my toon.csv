1043615,Fisherman,2019-04-25 20:42:00,7201,Almost looks like that would be the right size.   Matter of fact they actually make kits for string trimmers.
1043616,dave524,2019-04-25 21:01:00,4508,so I see ?  
1043617,misfish,2019-04-25 21:40:00,29133,Watched a video of one. I would go deaf in 2 hours.LOL They are cool.

1043621,misfish,2019-04-25 22:59:00,29133,"Thanks Art. Have not seen him around here in years. I,ll contact one of the rat pack fellas and see if I can get a hold of him."
1043622,Terry,2019-04-25 23:18:00,14456,"He on Facebook,  every time he  gets home from working the mine  I think it’s two weeks on two weeks off or something like that"
1043623,misfish,2019-04-25 23:26:00,29133,"I dont do FB, you know that."
1043624,Fisherman,2019-04-25 23:50:00,7201,He working for DeBeers in the mines?
1043625,Terry,2019-04-25 23:50:00,14456,Yup

1043628,Bernie,2019-04-26 00:03:00,3190,"Hello Brian. Just got home yesterday. 	I have a small 2HP Evinrude, but I think I will hang on to it as they are getting harder to find a good one. I'll check over at the shop to see if they have anything around."
1043642,Hack_Fisherman,2019-04-26 10:46:00,720,Even those girls aren’t going to help sell those things.  Five minutes and I’d be chucking the thing in the water.

1043650,irishfield,2019-04-26 14:39:00,26272,Brian's never going back anyhow... so forward is just fine!
1043652,Squid,2019-04-26 15:19:00,1656,I have a yammy 4hp  2 stroke that I am considering selling or trading for a bigger motor in the 9.9 range?
1043662,misfish,2019-04-26 21:53:00,29133,"4hp  is a bit too heavy Pete.  Between the battery and the electric,I am at 60 pounds. It,s not that it,s too heavy,it that I am charging the battery,lugging it. Having a light small gas motor would be nice to just fill and go."
