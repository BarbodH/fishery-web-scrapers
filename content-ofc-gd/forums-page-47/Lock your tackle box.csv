1043540,Headhunter,2019-04-24 14:57:00,5703,"Back in the 80's, I was in a ""hair band"", typical of the era. My girlfriend at the time (my wife of 30 years) used to go through my tackle box and ""steal"" my streamers, hair jigs etc... anything with purple! I used to get quite the laugh outta seeing her in the crowd wearing my fishin lures! HH "

1043670,Old Ironmaker,2019-04-27 01:44:00,8243,26 years ago I went on a date to our camp on the Ottawa with this woman. I told her we would be fishing for a week. When she saw my tackle she was amazed at how many things I had that would make great ear rings and piercings. 26 years latter we are still on our 1st date and she knows to leave the ear rings right where she found them. She is no longer into face shrapnel.
