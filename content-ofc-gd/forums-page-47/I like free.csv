1043711,misfish,2019-04-28 15:19:00,29133,"My buddy went and bought one of those fancy pantsy Nepolians,so asked if I wanted his old one.  I like free. Lost a knob on my travels,but I can get a replacement I am sure. Puts out 60,000 BTU. So he says. Even came with a rotisserie.  "
1043712,Headhunter,2019-04-28 15:25:00,5703,You'll likely need new burners Brian. Those are notorious for only lasting a year or two at best. Enjoy... and jerk up a chicken and put it on the rotisserie! HH
1043714,misfish,2019-04-28 15:31:00,29133,"I have fired it up and cleaned it. The right one looks like it may need to be replaced, but all in all,works pretty good. All blue flame,no orange. Buying burners is cheaper then a new BBQ."
1043715,Terry,2019-04-28 15:35:00,14456,Nice score
1043716,ketchenany,2019-04-28 15:43:00,3229,"I’ve had Centro since 2008! Burners are fine only replaced the shields once.  this year need to replace the brackets that hold them, easy fix. CT “donated “ the biggest they made."
1043718,dave524,2019-04-28 17:06:00,4508,"Bought the same when I retired in 2008 as well, burners are good but need  3 tent heat diffusers for this season,  Lowes has some one size fits all for 10 bucks each. Mine has an extra knob for an infrared rotisserie burner mounted on the back, does great but you need to put a drip tray under the chickens or whatever is on the spit or it makes a heck of a mess , good score. The battery lighter don't work after a few seasons but that isn't a problem."
1043719,ketchenany,2019-04-28 17:18:00,3229,"You may have the same unit as me (6800). 4 burners  and side grill . . .Yes one igniter went last year,  have to look into that. when I use rotisserie I put a pan filled haft with water and it does  it. No mess at all. Going to tear it apart and inspect  everything when it get warm great unit.  "
1043722,misfish,2019-04-28 19:58:00,29133,Granddaughter enjoyed the first batch of BBQ Schneider s dogs. I'm #1.
1043727,ketchenany,2019-04-28 21:48:00,3229,"Wait until she tastes  your fish!  Baked in  an aluminum foil pouch with onions and lemon slices, white wine can also do the trick B. Steam cook it. Enjoy."
1043729,SirCranksalot,2019-04-28 23:41:00,3291,So when are we coming over for burgers?? 
1043736,aplumma,2019-04-29 11:52:00,6896,good score Brian ' Art
1043738,NAW,2019-04-29 14:04:00,4022,Fits like a glove!
1043744,TJQ,2019-04-29 15:03:00,7806,Im still using the one you gave me!!!!!   Its got one more year left in it im sure!!!!
1043751,misfish,2019-04-29 18:10:00,29133,That has to be about 15 years old now or more. That Is  newfie quality built. Yes Bye
1043754,misfish,2019-04-29 20:21:00,29133,"Here,s a kicker for all ya.  Buddy told me today he bought it 2008. Never bought a part for it and NEVER covered it. He did make new plates to cover the burners. Outside 12 months of the year.  WOW.  "
1043756,Fisherman,2019-04-29 21:51:00,7201,"Well my neighbours got an old Weber cast aluminum one, it's been outside for at least 15 years and still going strong.  mines a real Broil King and a bit discoloured but will probably last me a long while yet.  I despise those tin can models, you see more on the side of the road in spring than garbage."
1043757,ketchenany,2019-04-29 21:51:00,3229,"Brian, those are  tough units. My 6800 is also a 2008 year.  Yes, I cover it and under a gazebo, but outside, it does get wet and snowed on. I have (me bad) left it on two times. Mine is natural gas it ran, sad to say. But no damage done.  I always run it on low for a short time after cooking, burns the grills of any residue, scrape it clean and shut it off. the first time I left it on nearly killed me. CT has changed vendors but CENTRO is still alive. One thing I do when it reaches temperature I brush the hot grills with a mixture of olive oil and vinegar. It flares up for a second and flavours the meat. BTW I use a celery stem with leaves or parsley for a brush. use it well my friend, it will last a long time.   "
