1043207,Peter Rawlings,2019-04-17 13:38:00,2,Does anyone know where and when the smelt run will be?
1043208,BillM,2019-04-17 13:39:00,17367,If I knew that I'd also predict the lottery.
1043211,Terry,2019-04-17 14:27:00,14456,Next Monday 945 pm  its a crap shoot but with the coming weather rain and wind should move the ice  the smelt should start
1043218,jimmer,2019-04-17 17:55:00,2730,Most people wouldn't post their spot on a forum anyway.  Best to just go out and check out the usual spots until they show up.

1043309,pike slayer,2019-04-19 15:54:00,1177,They are just starting here in the sault area
1044094,chrisb,2019-05-07 02:35:00,24,"Nothing  tonight. I don't know if the timing is off, the spot is bad or the smelts are gone. Is anyone else getting anything on Lake Erie?"
1044107,pike slayer,2019-05-07 11:01:00,1177,Chrisb sorry but your way late. Here in the sault the run is like over.so it's long over for weeks down south.
1044109,chrisb,2019-05-07 11:54:00,24,There was still ice in the lake last week here.
