1042869,jimmer,2019-04-11 16:05:00,2730,I took a walk down to the dam in Lindsay yesterday at lunch.  The walleye are in there spawning now.
1042873,OhioFisherman,2019-04-11 16:33:00,6623,"I watched a couple of videos showing the walleye run in my area, the run has been on here for a couple of weeks at least. Now we are looking at 8 - 10 consecutive days with a high probability of rain, hope that it doesn't hurt the spawn!"
1042899,captpierre,2019-04-11 23:19:00,2521,Nice. Did you stare or show  some respect?  ??????
1042925,jimmer,2019-04-12 13:06:00,2730,"They didn't know I was there, I was hiding behind a tree. ??"
1042970,Big Cliff,2019-04-13 12:35:00,6899,"I stopped by yesterday, only saw a couple of them, I think the spawn is just starting here."
1043092,jimmer,2019-04-15 17:28:00,2730,"Walked down there again today and didn't see one walleye.  The water is higher and more stained than last week. However, the carp are in!"
1043098,captpierre,2019-04-15 20:33:00,2521,Do carp spawn there or are they enjoying walleye spawn?
1043130,jimmer,2019-04-16 14:19:00,2730,Probably enjoying walleye spawn. Too early for them to spawn.
1043673,captpierre,2019-04-27 12:18:00,2521,I wonder how the walleye spawn success rate will be this year. Lots of water. Shouldn’t be any high an dry eggs. Let’s hope
1043686,OhioFisherman,2019-04-27 15:37:00,6623,"https://www.greatlakesnow.org/2019/02/almost-everything-you-want-to-know-about-lake-eries-walleye-population/ "" The Division of Wildlife’s 2018 trawl found 112 walleye per hectare (about 2.5 acres.)  That’s the second-highest number on record and far above the 20-year average of 27 walleye per hectare in Ohio waters.  Ohio biologists conduct about 40 trawls in the Western Basin. Initial reports from trawls conducted by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources & Forestry in Ontario waters showed similar results.  In fact, Richard Drouin, lead management biologist with OMNRF, said they’re more than happy with the results. “Walleye numbers for us based on our survey are at an all-time high,” he said. “We sampled 36 sites on our side and we use the same protocol as Ohio.” "" This just pertains to Lake Erie, the numbers seem to indicate to me that one poor spawn shouldn't affect the population too badly, but you still hope for the best?"
