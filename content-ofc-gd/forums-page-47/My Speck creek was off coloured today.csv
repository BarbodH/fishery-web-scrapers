1043914,misfish,2019-05-02 20:18:00,29133,That is not a fly rod .  Nice
1043918,Speckyguy,2019-05-02 20:25:00,4,"This creek is less than 3 feet wide a is full of blow downs. As soon as the water comes down round about July/s,   I'll start fly fishing again"

1043936,Speckyguy,2019-05-03 02:56:00,4,Management strategy for this little creek is to remove the browns to lessen competition for the brookies. It is a small creek with fantastic brook trout habitat and gets electofished with browns being removed to a brown trout river. It is a tiny creek and I am pretty sure is very under utilized. So while I would probably never keep them out of a brown trout creek I have no issues removing them from this particular creek.
1043940,misfish,2019-05-03 11:32:00,29133,I have not been out up here. Crap weather and river and creeks unfishable.  I hope I can get a throw or 2 in on Sunday
1043945,BillM,2019-05-03 14:42:00,17367,"Appreciate the insight    Would be nice for the levels to drop around here, I feel like tossing some streamers!"
