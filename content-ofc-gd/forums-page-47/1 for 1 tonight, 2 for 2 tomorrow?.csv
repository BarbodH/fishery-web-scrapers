1044086,Rizzo,2019-05-07 02:01:00,4754,ya maybe haul my boat out of retirement one of these days as well
1044138,kickingfrog,2019-05-08 03:11:00,8333,Your girl started right up tonight in the driveway. Just like every year since I got it.
1044140,misfish,2019-05-08 09:59:00,29133,Nice going on the Toms Rob. Did ya have the go pro going ?
1044171,kickingfrog,2019-05-08 20:29:00,8333,No. The first time things happened so fast that I didn't start it and the second time my son was also along and didn't bother. First ever doubles for us and neither were on video.
1044232,Rizzo,2019-05-10 01:23:00,4754,"right on! It was a great boat for me I am glad it has continued that way for you. Luckily my new boat has also been a champ, so I am not having seller's remorse...I needed something bigger for Lake St C and I got it...we both win!"
