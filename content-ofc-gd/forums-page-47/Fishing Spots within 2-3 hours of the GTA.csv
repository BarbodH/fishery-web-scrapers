Can someone recommend any spots within 2-3 hours of the GTA that have boat rentals and perhaps a place to stay overnight too? Thanks and happy fishing!"
1043857,Squid,2019-05-01 15:44:00,1656,"Honey harbor, Lake Erie in the crystal beach area, all of the kawartha lakes. There are pike and bass around the Toronto islands too."
1043858,Squid,2019-05-01 15:44:00,1656,Oh and welcome to the Board.

1043866,S_EEk_ER,2019-05-01 17:06:00,4,"Thanks, guys - appreciate the really quick reply.  I'll check out all of your suggestions.  ?"
1043869,Tjames09,2019-05-01 19:01:00,664,"No one will give you precise spot. But any lake with public access will have fish. Lots of lakes within  2 hours of gta that have public launches. Sounds like your new to fishing, make sure you read and respect all the regulations and follow whatever license you buy (sport or conservation). Bass doesn't open until late June, and walleye isn't till late May. Theres usually limits on perch and crappie as well."
1043871,S_EEk_ER,2019-05-01 19:31:00,4,I figured that ? I used to fish a long time ago so I am familiar with different fishing seasons depending on the fish and limits etc.  I always had a conservation license because I catch-and-release.  I actually didn't know there were limits on crappie.  Thanks for the tip - I know it's important to always be in compliance.
1043873,jimmer,2019-05-01 19:40:00,2730,"There are limits on most panfish now. Sunfish have a limit of 300, but only 30 at a specific size. These are examples from the regs for zone 17. Crappie 	Season: open all year 	Limits: S-30 and C-10  	Sunfish 	Season: open all year 	Limits: S-300; only 30 may be greater 	than 18 cm, and C-15  	Yellow Perch 	Season: open all year 	Limits: S-50 and C-25 Most of the kawarthas provides good fishing and there is usually free access somewhere."
1043878,bassman87,2019-05-01 22:23:00,586,If you wanna come out one day when bass season opens I can take you out on lake erie and lay the hurt on some small jaws. been catching walleye in the mix last year too. Most fish coming on jerkbaits so it's good times.
1043901,S_EEk_ER,2019-05-02 14:57:00,4,"Good info guys, thank-you. And thanks for the offer bassman, I'll keep that in mind.  My girlfriend has dibs right now, haha."
1043921,David Chong,2019-05-02 20:57:00,836,"Tons of great fishing in that range! Less shore fishing access than before but if you have a boat, you're golden!"
