1044218,Nemo,2019-05-09 19:51:00,727,All the latest news and photos here... http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/news/ice-out.php No back country permits will be issued till May 15th.
1043089,wee scot,2019-04-15 16:00:00,75,With the crazy April weather this year what date would you guys expect ice out for Algonquin park.My guess would be May 5
1043090,irishfield,2019-04-15 17:14:00,26272,May 20th.. Temagami currently has 3 feet of snow in the bush and 30+ good inches of ice on the lake. 
1043091,Sinker,2019-04-15 17:20:00,8692,"I""d say the may long weekend would be an optimistic guess. lol  S."
1043112,chris.brock,2019-04-16 02:01:00,4053,"I've got the week starting May 11th booked off and I hope to be paddling, I think I'll be ok crazy winter, it was all warm until a little after New Years then bam, deep freeze"
1043114,Chuck Enwinde,2019-04-16 04:33:00,247,Two weeks ago things were as far behind as I can recall seeing them.  Looks like some ice melting weather is on the way though.  I think May 5 sounds about right.  I can tell you if I had plans for opener I wouldn't be hopeful.
1043121,Randy Mitson,2019-04-16 11:21:00,3,"Hey guys you can enter the Algonquin Outfitters, Ice Out Contest for Lake Oepongo in Algonquin Park for a chance to win prizes, but there are only two days left to enter. https://algonquinoutfitters.com/contest/2019-algonquin-park-ice-out-contest/"
1043165,Joeytier,2019-04-16 19:03:00,3990,"We are behind schedule yet again for ice out, but the forecast looks very promising for things to change quickly.  I'm happy to be putting my sled to bed. My guess is that we will be about a week ahead of last year, somewhere in the first week of May."
1043231,NAW,2019-04-17 20:28:00,4022,"A co-worker of mine has been going to Cedar every year for opener.  He is confident that the ice will be gone by then.  According to him, he has fished Cedar every opener for 35 years (likely not true...).  I'm trying to tell him it might not happen this year, and he's not listening.  And he is taking is 83 year old dad out with him.  All the reports I can find are all for Oepongo.  Anyone know if Cedar and Oepongo get ice out around the same time?  Not sure the currents in the lakes."
1043247,Chuck Enwinde,2019-04-18 04:16:00,247,"Absolutely not true lol.  Ice out on Cedar last year didn't happen until two weeks after opener.  It's usually around the same as Opeongo. Here is a pic of Cedar from May 7 last year. https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?p=geographic&l=VIIRS_SNPP_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Aqua_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor(hidden),MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor,Reference_Labels(hidden),Reference_Features(hidden),Coastlines&t=2018-05-07-T00%3A00%3A00Z&z=3&v=-79.24311367303636,45.45490156624771,-77.66108242303636,46.36347090218521&ab=off&as=2017-04-23T00%3A00%3A00Z&ae=2017-04-30T00%3A00%3A00Z&av=3&al=false You can go back year by year if you're interested."
1043267,NAW,2019-04-18 14:03:00,4022,"Thanks for the reply Chuck!  I am going to show him this thread, just to rub it in his face a little!"
1043273,Randy Mitson,2019-04-18 16:08:00,3,"We operate the Outfitters on Cedar Lake and typically it's free of ice around the same time as Opeongo, mainly because it has more flow through.  But like last year it has opened up after Opeongo too.  The difficulty is sometimes the condition of the road getting down to Brent on Cedar Lake as sometimes it requires quite a bit of maintenance.  We haven't been in yet this season but we did hire a couple of guys to go in earlier on snowmobiles to shovel the roof of it's snow load and they commented that they thought it was going to be late this season.  I wouldn't guarantee it to be open by trout season opening.  Currently I'm guessing around May 10th for both Opeongo and Cedar but we still have time for mother nature to make changes, warm positive temps over night, rain and wind will all help move things along. Here's a couple of pictures we took from Lake Opeongo yesterday April 17th 2019   "
1043275,Chuck Enwinde,2019-04-18 18:06:00,247,Thanks for the update  Randy.  Can't get better intel than that.
1043300,wee scot,2019-04-19 11:19:00,75,Hopefully all this rain and wind we are getting will help a lot
1043313,BootScoot,2019-04-19 16:47:00,5,Not a chance it's that late..  it would beat the record ice out by a significant margin....things are ahead of last year and ice out was may 10...ice will likely be gone this year sometime the first week of may
1043347,Randy Mitson,2019-04-20 15:42:00,3,Some more photos  from Algonquin Park's ice out.  These photos were captured by my good friend Jerry Schmanda on Wednesday April 17th 2019           
1043440,wee scot,2019-04-22 12:34:00,75,It's starting to look like may 5 could be possible
1043483,Chuck Enwinde,2019-04-23 05:19:00,247,It would be 4 days later than last year.  Temagami wasn't ice free until the 16th of May last year.
1043489,BootScoot,2019-04-23 14:02:00,5,The thread is about Algonquin Park.... Last year's ice out in Algonquin was May 10 and the record is May 15

1043546,colin519,2019-04-24 16:13:00,101,"I find the the ice is only half the battle. Those access roads are often flooding and make it an adventure if you can't ford 18"" of water"
1043591,OhioFisherman,2019-04-25 02:37:00,6623,Our weather here in the tropics seems to be running a week or two behind normal. another 10 days until we get over 60 degrees again. Looks like another late start for the farmers.
1043706,wee scot,2019-04-28 12:54:00,75,Looks like may 5 still  could happen
1043952,wee scot,2019-05-03 16:39:00,75,May 10 again this year hopefully
1044211,wee scot,2019-05-09 18:38:00,75,"The back country remains closed until May 14 if we are lucky, could this be the year they break the record ice out date."
1044212,Headhunter,2019-05-09 18:46:00,5703,"Not park info per say, but I spoke to a fella up in Espanola yesterday and he told me the ice just went out on Georgian Bay on Sunday. HH"
