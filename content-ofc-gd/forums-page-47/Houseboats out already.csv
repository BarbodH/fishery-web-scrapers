1044028,captpierre,2019-05-05 19:25:00,2521,Came across this in  Buckhorn. Talked to a guy. It’s the Happy Days houseboat staff weekend. They go out the weekend before opening as the kick off for the season. Checked  the boats out too. They have over 20. Sold out for 2019. Booking 2020. 
1044062,FishFinder17,2019-05-06 16:42:00,139,I've done a bachelor party trip on the happy days luxury (the red and white one second back in your pic) Amazing people to deal with and an exceptional houseboat. We had an incredible time and I would definitely do it again. Only challenge was backing that thing out of the locks in bobcaygeon while the nervous yacht-owners watched...won't do that again lol!

Good off season rate, can't remember prices but it was't ridiculous.. That is how we discovered Bobcaygeon and ended up buying a cottage there. Sometimes you spend silly money and it actually works out?"
