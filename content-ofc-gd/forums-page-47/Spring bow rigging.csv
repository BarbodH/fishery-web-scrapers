How do you rig up for your spring run rainbows? Thanks, Reef"

1043174,Garnet,2019-04-16 21:19:00,2056,I'm in fall the to March break crowd . But I can't be trusted here it is April 16 and trout sticks still in truck. Fly's always half a dewy no weight and of course bags. Again I can't be trusted anything for a bite.

1043753,Reef Runner,2019-04-29 20:21:00,980,"Hit opener this weekend.  I arrived at my spring run spot as the sun was rising around 5:30am, guys were already there lining the banks.  River was high, fast and dirty.  My usual bottom bouncing rig with a blown up worm was of no luck, moved to a tied bag...45 min into I land a nice eater sized rainbow.  That was it.  Nobody else landed anything that I saw, packed up around noon."
