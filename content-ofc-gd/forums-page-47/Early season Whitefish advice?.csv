Any preferred presentations?  I'll be long-line trolling for early season lakers (stocked) so hoping to tie into an incidental whittie. Thanks fellas, Reef"
1044223,cisco,2019-05-09 21:11:00,597,Don't get whitefish generally by trolling. Unless real slow with worm harnesses along bottom. They seem to gather in Spring on or related to shoals anywhere from 10 o 30 ft deep. So jigging spoons/rapalas/Meegs jigs or Vibratos work well on Simcoe. I know they are specialists at stealing minnow off hook.
