We've gone up for years and fished the areas around Toad Lake, Dollars Lake, and Kawigamog, along with navigable sections of the river. Now, Kawigamog and the area have plenty of fish to go around, plenty of healthy bass and lots of little to average sized pike, but nothing crazy.  Over the last few summers, my brother and I have ventured beyond our lake, going back through Smokey Lake into Noganosh by canoe. We've camped on islands and worked over several areas back there, in search of big pike. I figured since its a remote access lake, with plenty of acreage and depth to it, that we'd be wearing our arms off pulling in some lunkers. I was right, but so far, its just been big bass. While we've been able to locate plentiful amounts of 4 and 5 lb smallies and largemouths back there, I haven't landed a single big pike. I was wondering, is there some secret to it? I'm used to pike fishing on the Pickerel River, but maybe they're not as thick back in Noganosh? Maybe its the areas we're fishing, or the time of year too. Don't know, was wondering if anyone's had some luck with the big girls back in there and had some advice."

718837,torco,2012-07-30 19:20:00,656,My guess is you have to troll the deeper waters. I think the fishing has slowed considerably over the years with most of the bass being on smallish side now.
