718852,GBW,2012-07-30 19:56:00,8460,"Bill, he left BPS and is at SAIL now..."
718853,GBW,2012-07-30 19:57:00,8460,"Lew, I'm going up to my folks place for a few day's near the end of the week and if you need anything from the Oshawa area let me know."
718909,belippy,2012-07-30 23:45:00,88,I got 2 x NRX rods there for 20% off plus tax-in when their Oshawa store open.
719177,2jack2,2012-07-31 19:20:00,92," What I am trying to say is there are many great fishermen out there do know about fishing and are dedicated to the fishing industry. BPS or SAIL, associates help many customer everyday and they are very happy with the service we provided. I agreed knowledge is important when it comes to fishing, smart company do not hire people base on knowledge. The whole package needs to include knowledge, personality, team player and availability. Knowledge alone donâ€™t make a good salesmen."
719184,lew,2012-07-31 19:33:00,12766," Just saw this now Geoff and thanks alot for the offer, but I've got everything I need for now.  Much appreciated though !!"
719188,GBW,2012-07-31 19:36:00,8460,No worries Lew.  I'll be there Thursday so if things change PM me.
719190,GBW,2012-07-31 19:38:00,8460,"Jackie, I was never taking a shot at you or the company, just saying...  I know you know your stuff and are more than willing to help out.  Just like you did for me with a reel at BPS I was after.  I was just telling Bill where you landed...  *edit to add*  I wish more big box stores had staff like you due to your knowledge and willing to help!  PLZ send that to MGT too!  Geoff"
719194,BillM,2012-07-31 19:46:00,17367,"I would never bag on sales staff, I hope Jackie didn't take my post the wrong way (I could see how he could, my bad)..  There are so many people that go into these stores and know absolutely nothing, having someone who is knowledgeable can really point them in the right direction the first time!"
718021,BillM,2012-07-26 16:10:00,17367,"I never go into big box stores (Sail/BPS) and expect some in-depth fishing recommendations from any of the staff.  Let's be realistic, most of them aren't fisherman and even if they are, most of us here probably know more then they do anyhow.  I'm not trying to come off as an ass, but it is what it is..  If I can go to a big box store and save a few bucks I will.  I don't go into any fishing store looking for advice, I'll figure that out all on my own."
718024,Roy,2012-07-26 16:14:00,13728,"Hush up now...if everyone thought that way, Oshawa, Peterborough and a bunch of others would become clusterbleeps as well. A lot of people are happy there and so it should be."
718052,Stoty,2012-07-26 18:36:00,2910,Headed to Cabela's tonight!!! Can't wait!
718054,BillM,2012-07-26 18:58:00,17367, Lucky!
718161,Stoty,2012-07-27 01:58:00,2910," It was awesome!!!! Def the best outdoor stores, by far! Sure hope they come to Canada soon!"
718166,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-27 02:14:00,2690," Already in Canada, Jamie.  Unfortunately, not here in Ontario."
718170,Stoty,2012-07-27 02:25:00,2910,Then the GTA needs one!!
718177,Dave Bailey,2012-07-27 02:56:00,1641,"I'm within walking distance of Tightline so that's my first choice. I have been into the Sail in Oshawa and Vaughan, I like them. But I would like them to do something with their web site, it's nowhere near as comprehensive as CT or BPS."
718178,Fisherpete,2012-07-27 02:57:00,1814,"I shopped at Gagnon's today, and started looking for a product on one of the shelves. A salesman walked by, looked like maybe even a manager. I asked him a question, he went to the back to get me an answer - but never returned, leaving me standing there for 10-15 minutes.  I got over it and kept browsing, at which point ran into Dave Mercer! He was there doing some shopping! I walked over, shook his hand and said hello, and introduced my son Nick to him. He was very down to earth, and an overall great guy. We chatted briefly about a local lake. Afterwards, my son beamed ""That's the first famous person I have met!"" Very cool.    Maybe the staff member who forgot about me saw Dave lol...  I then went to the rod section, and called over another salesperson for some advice on a muskie rod... but it was obvious that this was not his area of expertise by any means. I left the store empty handed.  I crossed the street and headed to the Oshawa Sail. I headed up to the fishing area, and started looking at rods. Almost immediately, I was greeted by a salesman, who happened to be a bass guy. He didn't have the best answer for my muskie rod question, but called another staff member over who was. He gave me some great advice and helped me choose the right rod. Oh, he also price matched LeBaron for me on the rod! I left happy with the rod, some line and 4 muskie lures.  So - the moral of the story - big box is not always bad. I have had nothing but great service from the Oshawa Sail since it has opened. I have had just as much bad service as good in some of the smaller shops - but I have to give props to LeBarons for improving, they are much better now than in previous years. As in any sales industry, to succeed you need to have knowledgeable, customer focused staff on duty, who actually WANT to help you, not just do a job.  Pete"
718186,BillM,2012-07-27 03:12:00,17367,We really need a Cabelas here..  Slap one down right across the highway from BPS.
718190,ah_long,2012-07-27 03:51:00,354,SAIL has always been go to me. Staff there are friendly and helpful. Their 50% off clothing sale right now is amazing. They also have the best prices on fishing electronics when they have the no tax events.
718215,Stoty,2012-07-27 10:52:00,2910,Their no tax events don't include electronics. (at least they're not supposed to....)
718218,Roy,2012-07-27 11:34:00,13728, No electronics or firearms usually.
718222,grimsbylander,2012-07-27 11:40:00,3016,  I go the the Pennsylvania Cabelas everytime I'm down that way. It's an amazing place to visit. The only problem is I always know exactly what I want as I'm walking in and then get completely overwhelmed gawking at things and half way home remember what I went for.
718226,grimsbylander,2012-07-27 12:04:00,3016,  The thing that drives me absolutely nuts is seeing employees(even owners) at fishing stores getting arrogant and condescending with customers. The day Kevin VanDam is behind the counter selling me a pack of freaking hooks I'll accept it. I was in the infamous Hamilton fishing woXXX...store this year and saw it with two teenage boys. I walked over after the jerk was finished making them feel like he invented the fishing rod and helped them pick out basic plastics for smallmouth. The opposite of that is Martin at Grimsby Tackle. He's a down to earth guy who tries to respectfully help everyone with no pressure or intimidation. This concludes my rant for today.
718240,Fish Farmer,2012-07-27 13:15:00,2234,"I'm sorry, but I'll keep my money here and support the little guy."
718242,lew,2012-07-27 13:19:00,12766," I always support the little guy too Dave, but when they don't have what I need, I hafta to move on to bigger stores. Up this way there aren't any places that carry alot of the stuff I need."
718255,Fish Farmer,2012-07-27 13:56:00,2234,"I understand Lew, I have bought some stuff from the big boys, that the little guy can't get. I like shotting the crap with my local guy for hours, some time I forget what I went there for.   Great meeting place to meet the local boys. Some time a Timmy's will get you some secret spot or bait."
718265,Stoty,2012-07-27 14:25:00,2910," Hahah, that's exactly what happens! I ended up walking out of Cabela's last night with a bunch of things that I wasn't even planning on!"
718298,UglyBug,2012-07-27 16:32:00,148,"I work right across the road from the one in Ottawa, it's a good place to buy nothing, poor service, poor selection and the prices are higher than most stuff at my local tackle shop.  Not for me"
718801,2jack2,2012-07-30 16:44:00,92," if you don't know the fact, do not make the assumption. But for those who think they know everything, then not much I can do about it."
718823,Dutch,2012-07-30 18:03:00,831,"I visted the store in Oshawa a couple of times the last two weeks.  I always frequent their bargain bins - picked up a couple of packages of salamander baits for $2 each.  They have very competitive pricing on soft plastics - Yum products were $4.50/12 and genuine yamamoto senkos were $6-7/pack.  That's lower than all of the other stores I have seen.  The average for Yum is $6-7 and Senkos are usually $9+.  Also had clearance prices on summer clothing for 50% off.  Picked up a couple of nice shimano t's for $10.  If paying more at an independant makes you feel good, go ahead, but unless a significant number of people are doing the same thing, it doesn't mean much.  The only thing they can do to keep their doors open are lower the prices to be competitive.  Same reason why so many of us are shooping on-line through the states, it is just cheaper to do so and the internet has made great products more avialable."
718824,BillM,2012-07-30 18:09:00,17367, Huh?
718825,BucktownAngler,2012-07-30 18:10:00,582, senkos are now $6-7/pack everywhere you go. BPS lowered from $9.99 to 6.99  le baron $6 and change  the highest prices ive seen on them lately is at JB's
718844,esoxansteel,2012-07-30 19:36:00,1307,"When they seen you coming into Gagnons Lews, they ran and lowered the price 60.00 to have such charm and grace honour their store, actually you got a steal, or the price might have been wrong, the legends from the 8 ft top n tail to the 9ft big nasties are 320.00 to 360.00 at Rollie and Helen's US prices."
717799,lew,2012-07-25 20:05:00,12766,"I needed some terminal tackle that isn't available around here, and seeing as I had nothing to do to-day, I decided it was a good time to take the 1 hour drive and go down to Oshawa to visit the new SAIL store.  First thought was it was alot bigger than I figured it would be and they've also got a large parking lot.  When I walked inside and glanced around I was pleasantly surprised at the large selection of outdoor gear they've got and the way it's displayed around the store. I spent an hour wandering around just looking at everything even though I didn't really need much. The staff seemed friendly and I was asked several times if I needed help with anything.  The store is well laid out and everything is easy to find.  I didn't spend much time comparing prices but was surprised to see them asking ALOT more money for at least one fishing rod. I purchased a St. Croix Legend Tournament musky rod at Gagnons a couple months ago for $260 and SAIL was asking $320 for the exact same rod.  If alot of their higher end gear is that much more expensive than other places they may end up losing business.  Other than that I was impressed with the store and I'm admittedly kinda confused with all the negative comments about the place I've seen posted here in the past.  Anyways, I liked the place and will definetly go back again and just thought I'd share my thoughts......for whatever that's worth"
717800,misfish,2012-07-25 20:10:00,29133,Told ya it was a nice store Lew.
717801,lew,2012-07-25 20:13:00,12766, I'd never doubt your word Brian
717804,davey buoy,2012-07-25 20:17:00,5505,"I liked it,but the two times I've been there they didn't have what I wanted.All fairness bps didn't what have whatI wanted either.Nice looking store thou."
717805,johnnyb,2012-07-25 20:18:00,3413,"I've only been happy with ymy visits so far....but I AM surprised to hear of that much of a price difference.  So far they have been really sharp on prices....mind you...I don't go lookin' at the real high end stuff  I will say that over the last couple years I've really seen the value of competition.  I love my small stores, like JB's, Angling Specialties, and if you consider them small, LeBaron.  Always find good deals, and so far, the only one that's been getting less of my money is BPS."
717809,lew,2012-07-25 20:32:00,12766," Yeah, JB's has been my go-to store for years but he's 2 hours away from me now and I have NO interest in driving thru Toronto again....ever again  There's not many tackle shops around here and only the very basic musky gear is available, so most times now I just order on-line if I can't find it down in Oshawa."
717811,davey buoy,2012-07-25 20:36:00,5505,"I pretty well stick with JB's, Le Barons And of course Ct. That daily Canadian tire money for gas goes a long way towards fishing gear!"
717828,hooked!,2012-07-25 21:24:00,38,"I've been happy with my experiences at SAIL so far as well.  If you sign up for their loyalty program, they send you emails about promotions.  They seem to have a tax-free (they pay the equilavent of the taxes) promo fairly frequently.  I find Lebaron's prices pretty hard to beat."
717830,davey buoy,2012-07-25 21:26:00,5505, Me too!!
717837,mercman,2012-07-25 21:48:00,7054,"When the sail store opened here, the selection was very poor.It was improved alot over the last 2 years. I have had great experiences here too.Returned for credit 2 broken Abu Vendettas no questions asked. They lack a good catalogue, and i find they let thier fishing tackle inventory slide badly in the winter months. But all in all, its an ok place to shop.  "
717839,lew,2012-07-25 21:59:00,12766," Looks like I forgot to mention that I STILL didn't get what I was looking for.  I use #5 SPRO ball bearing swivels and SAIL doesn't carry them and Gagnon was sold out.  Oh well, it was still a nice day for a drive"
717843,Pikeslayer,2012-07-25 22:19:00,1443," Lew, If ya like, I'll call Steve @ JB tomorrow to confirm he has them in stock. He is 10 minutes fom my plant. Cliff & Sue are visiting here fore the weekend and I'm sure they could find room to haul them back to Sturgeon. If you got a SKU/product # and quantity that would be helpful.  Simon"
717844,johnnyb,2012-07-25 22:23:00,3413,"Sort of in the same vein as Simon's offer....I was going to suggest that if you ever need a shopping list completed at JB's, Lew, I'd be happy to pick it up and deliver it....to your boat"
717847,lew,2012-07-25 22:43:00,12766,"Thanks for the offers Simon & Johnny, very generous of both of you.  I've got enough stuff for awhile and will be placing an order to the States in the next month or so and can get everything else I need then too.  We've got a good group around here"
717849,ctered,2012-07-25 22:50:00,40,"Not sure if the pricing for St. Croix rods is the same as it used to be, but at one time they were like Apple products in that their price was fixed by them and not by the store. That way every store would have to sell for the same price to give the smaller stores the same chance at a sale as the larger stores."
717853,hotsky,2012-07-25 23:19:00,400,I've been there a couple of times both times ended up spending money lol. They're not as cheap as LeBarons but I got a good deal on a Shimano reel they have on sale.
717899,BucktownAngler,2012-07-26 02:42:00,582,"Price wise Le barons beats everywhere else.  if you can have other store price match them, then youre usually better off.  i had CT price match a portable hut last year. $299 at CT, $152 at Le barons....and the gave me back $15 (10%) in CT money"
717900,GreenCanada,2012-07-26 02:44:00,375,"   It is my understanding that Sail is Lebaron's version of a big box store. Same company, just different chain name.  I have found the pricing on spoons, rapalas, spinners are nearly half the price of CT and smaller independent stores. Additionally, they have some great sales on other gear. I managed to pick up a Garmin Oregon 450 for about 80 bucks off or so, which was great because I was already planning on buying one! I love coincidences.  I'm happy with the one in Burlington, though, I can't wait until they get an account setup with Panther Martin so I can go crazy on spinners again!!"
717991,Jer,2012-07-26 14:03:00,1426,"I've been to the Oshawa store a couple times, only bought some hooks and plastic baits. Nicely laid out store and lots of selection. I was there pricing out a new Compre rod at the time. They had the same price as Le Barons at $115. I ended up buying one at Gagnons for $105."
717992,Lunkerhunter,2012-07-26 14:17:00,455,lebarons in markham carries those swivels.... so does tightline in pickering.
718004,Roy,2012-07-26 15:07:00,13728, That's incorrect. It's a long convoluted story but they're not the least bit related. Far from it in fact.
718011,jayess,2012-07-26 15:31:00,187,"I'm always happy to have another shopping option, but i've found the folks at Sail to be, for the most part, not knowledgeable about their product or its uses. Stock also seems to be an ongoing issue (with my visits) -- I ask if they carry something, they say that i have to check their catalogue. I check their catalogue, product's not in the system. I ask what's in their system, and they can't get some of those items. Maybe it's just ""big box store syndrome"", but i certainly don't look to Sail as anything more than the local Walmart of outdoor rec gear. Gagnon's takes the cake for me."
718013,Headhunter,2012-07-26 15:34:00,5703,I've tried to make it to the Oshawa store a couple of times... but my truck always seems to take the Brock Street exit in Pickering straight into the Tightlines parking lot... maybe one day I'll make it there! HH
718016,lew,2012-07-26 15:52:00,12766,"Tightlines is good but it brings me closer to Toronto than I ever want to be again, infact even Oshawa is really pushing my limits anymore"
718020,Headhunter,2012-07-26 16:05:00,5703,"I don't blame you one bit Lew! Living on the Scarborough/Pickering border, I ALWAYS go to Durham to find what ever it is that I want... anything to avoid Toronto! HH"
