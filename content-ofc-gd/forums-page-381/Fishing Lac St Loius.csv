719254,mercman,2012-07-31 23:14:00,7054,"I just got a PM from someone questioning my use of the words ""Slot Size"" Where i fish we are alllowed to keep walleye between 37 and 57 cm , hence the term ""in the slot"".So when i said luckily they were in the slot, that means that all of them were between 37 and 53 cm.  You may now return to your schedules activities"
719307,Moosebunk,2012-08-01 02:11:00,3970,Some nice eyes... even if they're bulging out a little. lol.  Think the others have said enough for the help.
719390,troutologist,2012-08-01 15:02:00,951,"Not sure about that particular lake, but I have always found walleye below 30' that were willing to bite. With a slot size in place, and if that is the only depth to catch at this time of year, I would look to another species."
718900,mercman,2012-07-30 23:25:00,7054,"Lac St Louis is a huge lake connected to Lake St Francis by the St Lawerence river.I went fishing there with a local friend, and we did quite well.    Now look at one of the fish in my picture. It died from the bends. We kept the fish, and luckily for us, there were all in the slot.They were all caught jigging in 45-70 FOW.  What i would like to know, is there a way i can prevent this from happening, or how can i save the fishes lives if it happenes again?  Is fizzing a solution? and if so, how do i fizz a fish properly?  Thanks  Paul"
718903,Nipfisher,2012-07-30 23:33:00,2449,"Paul, I have seen people pausing as they reel the fish up to allow them to transition 1/2 way up then finish reeling them in. Also heard of people burping the fish. Not sure if either method is effective."
718910,Joeytier,2012-07-30 23:46:00,3990,Awesome!  those are some DEEP walters
718917,solopaddler,2012-07-31 00:01:00,8605,Best way to avoid that is reel the fish in super slow. Fizzing with a hypo has merit but in my experience doesn't work all that well especially in the warm waters of mid summer.  Great area btw. I fished LSF and LSL many years ago and enjoyed it immensely. Always wanted to go back...
718939,Roy,2012-07-31 01:40:00,13728,"The other alternative is to not fish in the kill zone, AKA 35'+"
718946,Pikeslayer,2012-07-31 02:01:00,1443,"If that's where this fish are, then that's where you target Paul. Good advice as mentioned in other posts, 'don't horse the fish to the surface' and 'pause on your retrieve with sufficient drag'. Chances of a successful release (if required) are exponential.  IMHO"
718948,mercman,2012-07-31 02:08:00,7054,Thanks guys Most of the answers are really helpful and appreciated.
718954,mercman,2012-07-31 02:17:00,7054," Then you know the area Water levels are so bad near Chateauguay and  Beauharnois, that there are more launchs closed than open.Shallower areas are void of most fish, except suckers and pike,and the deep water where i was fishing is stacked with walleye, Lake Trout and Sturgeon.We Caught one 40 inch sturgeon, and you could feel your jig bouncing off them and fallling the last 3 or 4 feet to the bottom. Crazy stuff."
718958,skeeter,2012-07-31 02:27:00,1907,"  Does this mean , no more ice fishing on simcoe for whities & lakers ?"
718961,Skipper D,2012-07-31 02:53:00,1970," No , just in the summer Skeeter...... "
718962,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-31 02:53:00,2690, Think Roy was speaking specifically about walleye.  The sane thing will happen to perch in those depths. As mentioned by others slow and steady can help.  Nice fish Paul!
718992,Billy Bob,2012-07-31 11:17:00,5865,Walleyes = DINNER  Muskies = Sport fish and shouldn't be targeted during certain times on the year.....that's the way I look at it.....
719009,mike rousseau,2012-07-31 12:15:00,4661,I keep a needle for fizzing in my tackle box.... But it's for emergency situations... I never plan on using it... But if the situation comes up where a big fish(to big for me to eat)  is gunna die... Then I'll fizz it and monitor it in my live well to be certain it will survive before it is released...  But that's why I fish less then 25 feet of water most of the time....
719014,Garnet,2012-07-31 12:41:00,2056,"Take the strap of lead off marker buoy and bend small hook and tie to other rod. Now put hook on inside lip, point the fish down and let it go. Hits bottom just shake off.  I never had much success with slow fighting. Go the other way and release quickly with the torpedo always worked better for me."
719016,Headhunter,2012-07-31 12:48:00,5703,"It's actually pretty simple... don't fish lower then 35 ft! I don't beleive that slow retrieve is gonna do anythng but prolong the inevitable... go fish for some bass until the Pickereyes are obtainable in non kill zone waters... This is no different than fishing below 30ft on Quinte in the fall, with the exception being the size of the fish. If catch and release is your goal, then don't fish kill zones. HH  PS... come on Skeeter, you know that Lake Trout can burp! Pickereyes can't!"
719034,darsky,2012-07-31 13:32:00,586,Hi Paul-I fish the lake regularly as I am a 4 min drive from it.Trust & believe me when I say that you DO NOT need to fish those depths to catch the eye's
719037,Garnet,2012-07-31 13:49:00,2056,Love the Foghat album. Except you are old to remember.

Thanks for sharing Jacques"
719197,Joeytier,2012-07-31 20:05:00,3990,I hear they perk right back up in a frying pan full of hot butter.
