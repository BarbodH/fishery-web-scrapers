The bigger smallies seemed to want topwater baits and tubes twitched just below the surface while only the smaller ones were interested in drop-shot presentations. Fish were mainly coming from 12-20 fow on the edge of sand-weed transitions and drops to deep water.  I didn't boat any giants; here's a typical fish. "
