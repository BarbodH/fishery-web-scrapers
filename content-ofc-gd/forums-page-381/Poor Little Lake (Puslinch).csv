719087,Musky or Specks,2012-07-31 15:30:00,2710,Really more of a pond than a lake. Yet every evening as I drive by it for work one or three boats and two or three carloads of people fishing it. I don't know how the poor fish can take all the pressure and its year round as well. I don't fish it personally for just that reason. Urban fisheries really need to have special regs placed on them.
719259,ricardo,2012-07-31 23:31:00,26,No one is pulling anything big out of there. It really is fished out. Traffic from shore is crazy and really too low to catchj anything besides bluegill.
719262,vinnimon,2012-07-31 23:45:00,2593,"The water level is very low, extremely low if your out there with an outboard. As for the fishing I didnt find it too bad, and all the fish looked very healthy and spunky ."
719264,Toad Hunter,2012-07-31 23:48:00,261,"I fished it a few times a week last summer, for a few hrs in the am. Happy to say I released everything I caught (all bass, a few crappie and a pike no longer than my forearm and not much thicker than, errr a couple fingers"
719265,Toad Hunter,2012-07-31 23:49:00,261,That was also week days - wouldn't dream of attempting it on a weekend
719292,Dutch,2012-08-01 01:26:00,831,Oh the horror. Families fishing and introducing kids to our sport.
719331,largemouthtrout,2012-08-01 05:28:00,53,"Mabey a better idea than adding extra regulations , to a pond that is easily accessed by , lets say , someone and thier little kids for a fun day of fishing . How about adding a few fish ? I'de like to believe that some of the money that i pay for my fishing licence , goes to more than pay the wages of someone who will write me a ticket , if i don,t have a licence ."
719386,Christopheraaron,2012-08-01 14:44:00,3525,"Definitely pressured, but still has some fish in it. Maybe if those idiots on puslinch opened it up the pressure would lower."
