And the stop feature at waterline is awesome.  My inaugural run with it was a complete success, with 3 kept and another 8 released, action was fast and furious but shut down when the rain picked up, which is weird because the trouts have never been affected by rain to me before.  he's a couple of the keepers.    This one came up from 140'down in 160 fow   Destined for the smoker..lol   This one pulled 50' of line twice before hitting the net.  Great day again on the water"
