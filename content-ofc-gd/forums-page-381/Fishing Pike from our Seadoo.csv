We have a 4 seater Seadoo LRV and the kids love it, but they also love fishing so I set it up so I can take it on fishing runs. No its not a fishing boat, but it works.  Here is the web site I set up:  http://www.seadoofishing.tk  Please check it out, its only the beginning.  Also if you have a fishing site I will post your link on my site if you do the same.  Cheers !"
