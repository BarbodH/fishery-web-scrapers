Mélissa is going to be 17 this fall    One more year in High school and then she graduates   times sure flies by fast  Brother in law calls the scarecrow ""The Beach Keeper""... he protects the flower beds behind it from a doe and her 2 fawns from eating them... They always come out during the night and in the morning, see their tracks on the beach  Your right, bijou is the right word for this place"
