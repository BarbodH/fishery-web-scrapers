717815,Skipper D,2012-07-25 20:38:00,1970,"What do you say when a twelve year old says at bed time , do you want to go fishing in the morning grandpa  . I woke him up at 6 this morning and asked him the question .... lol , it did'nt take long he was up dressed and out the door we went together for the first time . The fishing was'nt all that  great to speak of , we only fished for perch and tryed to find the big ones all over the lake with no sucsess , I did keep enought small ones to make a meal for us all tonight so he'd know what its all about , I enjoyed teaching him what little i knew and had fun watching him enjoy him self , i think the high lite of the hole day for him was the school of minnows that came to greet us , they stuck close to the boat for the longest time while he tryed over and over to catch them with a pail  . He asked me if i was going to share this with the people on OFC when we got home ... lol , he fell asleep on the sofa a little while ago after we turned the fish to fillets for his grandma to make and feed him for supper . first pic .... school of minnows around the boat , second pic .... Skippy jr showing me the way home ."
