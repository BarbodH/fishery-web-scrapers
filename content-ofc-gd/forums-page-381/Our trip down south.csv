Time, weather and no internet access conspired to make this a relatively fishing free vacation. Fact of the matter was my wife's mother is very ill and we had to be ready to visit at short notice. Could not make the fish-a-thon either  .   Good news, Mother-in-law is doing much better and we had fun despite the stresses.         ON THE 1ST DAY OF TRAVEL WE STOPPED AT LAKE SUPERIOR TO COOL OFF, EAT LUNCH, HAVE A PEE AND STRETCH OUR LEGS                         WE WERE A LITTLE LATE ARRIVING THE 2ND DAY, BUT GRAMPS (AKA COLONEL SANDERS) WAS WAITING AT THE TRAILER AT ERIEAU             JACK MADE FRIENDS QUICKLY WITH GRAMPS' FRIEND SONNY......WATER FIGHTS WERE FREQUENT AND FIERCELY CONTESTED                    FISHING WAS INFREQUENT AND LIMITED TO THE BREAKWATER WALL AND PIER, FISH WERE SMALL AND SCARCE                WE GOT ON THE OPEN WATER COURTESY OF ANOTHER FRIEND OF GRAMPS....JACK AND MUM GOT SOAKED...BUT HAD AN ABSOLUTE SCREAM!                            TOOK SOME TIME TO DO THE TOURIST THING, NIAGRA, CN TOWER AND A YUMMY CHINESE MEAL ON SPADINA                                           FINALLY GOT TO SEE GRAMMA IN HOSPITAL                THEN IT WAS BACK TO ERIEAU                        ON THE FINAL DAY JACK MET HIS COUSINS FOR THE FIRST TIME                           THEN IT WAS ANOTHER 2 DAY JOURNEY HOME            WAS GLAD TO BE HOME TO BE HONEST......I CANT HANDLE THE CROWDS FOR LONG THESE DAYS, AND THE DAY AFTER GETTING HOME NORMAL SERVICE RESUMED.

718748,limeyangler,2012-07-30 12:44:00,5204,Thanks for all the well wishes folks...i'll be sure she gets the message!      Thanks FF....mum snapped us on Jack's 'secret island' at the bottom of the yard...we often sit out on it and plan the next day.    He is evil with a water gun...NO MERCY! Takes after mum completely    He bought the little monster with tickets he won at the arcade at Niagra. He named him 'Dave Crick'. LOL...dont know where he pulled that name from...but Dave Crick had to come everywhere with us after that.
718788,adempsey,2012-07-30 16:01:00,1498,"Nothing like making a hospital visit into a fun little adventure!    Love the Dave Crick photos, lol!  All the best."
718795,fishnsled,2012-07-30 16:27:00,3520,"Nice report Simon and great to hear your mother-in-law is doing better. I like your idea of coming to the city for a few days and the rest of the year in paradise. If it was me I might be able to do the city trips every 2-3 years, maybe longer in between ."
718843,GBW,2012-07-30 19:36:00,8460,"Great report Simon.  We did the GWL and Niagra Falls stuff this weekend too and only live a few hours away from it, lol."

Thanks for sharing your trip with us Jacques"
