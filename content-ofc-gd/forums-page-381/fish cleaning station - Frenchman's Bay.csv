718387,Joeytier,2012-07-28 00:49:00,3990,There isn't...unless you have a tailgate.
718395,misfish,2012-07-28 01:21:00,29133, Cleaned many a fish that way.Always had a 2x4 slab of plywood.
718458,Default User,2012-07-28 15:48:00,72,Frenchmans Bay has really commercialized over the past few years. Not sure if the property management want to have the smell of fish guts roaming the area for the hipster crowds that go for boardwalk strolls and gelato.
718545,super dave,2012-07-29 11:28:00,323,Thanks for the replys.  Is there one in the east end?   Pickering Ajax area?
718546,Roy,2012-07-29 11:33:00,13728,Why do you need a fish cleaning station?
718590,Dave Bailey,2012-07-29 16:24:00,1641," Can't say I would really blame them, especially with the scavenger problem. The ring-billed gulls are already there in profusion. I live within walking distance of the area at the bottom of Liverpool Road, and I enjoy strolling there frequently, although I'm certainly NOT a 'hipster'. And with all the garbage left by fishermen down there it's a wonder they haven't done something about just dropping a line in the water. It's a pigsty, no insult to pigs intended.   Good point. I have one, it's right beside my kitchen sink. It's not like anyone is going to have a shore lunch on the rocks at Frenchman's Bay. Or are they?"
718591,BillM,2012-07-29 16:30:00,17367,"Why not clean fish at the launch?  Better then stinking up your livewell, lol..  Also, cleaning stations are a great place to get roe later in the season."
718592,misfish,2012-07-29 16:45:00,29133," Bill,SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
718700,super dave,2012-07-30 02:14:00,323," As bill said, for the roe.  Why let it go to waste?"
