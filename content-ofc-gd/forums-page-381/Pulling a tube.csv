My question is, can I tow the tube using the two metal handles that are formed into the top of the corners of the transom or do you think that could cause damage to the boat?  I have a 1992 16 foot starcraft that is solid, and does not leak or have any issues, so I wouldn't want to create any.   Thanks!"
718846,GBW,2012-07-30 19:38:00,8460,We did that for years and never had an issue.  Run a clip on roap from each side to act like the 1960's rear ski bar would then clip the tube to that roap and have fun.
