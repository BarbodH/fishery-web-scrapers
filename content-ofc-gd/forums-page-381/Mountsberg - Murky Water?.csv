I havent been in about 8 weeks and had a chance to go yesterday....but did not expect to find so much murky water.  Mountsberg is usually weedy, but I have always found the water to be quite clear for the most part.  I'm not from the immediate area and so I was wondering if anyone might know if it is due to a recent rain storm, wind storm or simply the June/July heat we have had this summer.  Need to bring more tackle next time lol.  Thanks All!"
