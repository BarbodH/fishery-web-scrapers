Arriving on Wednesday and only staying till Friday didn't give us a lot of time to catch up, however it did give me a few moments to cast a line off the dock. My gawd am I jealous of their beautiful piece of paradice.  Thanks for the invite...Can't wait to get out Muskie fishing next time.        "
