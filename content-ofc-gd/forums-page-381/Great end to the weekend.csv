719263,fishnsled,2012-07-31 23:48:00,3520, I've got an am crew and you can be the pm crew - if the weather holds. Going to be a busy day.    It certainly was good that evening Paul.
719276,Fish Farmer,2012-08-01 00:28:00,2234,"Thanks Will, viewed it that time, man, your buddy has it made. What a adventure of a life time. Just the feeling being so close to those Whales, I couldn't imagine  Just had a thought Will, OPP asking him if he had an Operators card  Your buddy would lose him in the traffic"
719283,fishnsled,2012-08-01 00:53:00,3520,"  :rofl2:  He actually does have his operators card and brought it with him. You're right though, probably as qualified if not more qualified then the OPP. (actually more with all the international stuff he has to know, I'm guessing) Glad you enjoyed the videos."
719306,Moosebunk,2012-08-01 02:07:00,3970,Solid time out fishing Will.  Great pics.
719406,Salmonidstalker,2012-08-01 16:04:00,265,Nice king!
718713,fishnsled,2012-07-30 04:14:00,3520,"It took a bit of planning, a lot of luck with the weather and the fishing but everything lined up perfectly.  My good friend Nik was back in town from Malaysia, taking a short break from sailing around the world. With all the family and friends him and his wife try to see while back in town it is tough to plan anything, let alone a few hours of fishing. A window opened up in the schedule and we took advantage of it and he brought his niece along, Hannah loves fishing with me. So with a couple of short stops we were on the water and fishing by 5pm.  It was only a matter of 15 minutes or so and the first fish was on. A nice rainbow of about 5 pounds that Hannah was fighting when it jumped about 20 feet behind the boat and got off. Oh well, it was still early in the evening. Lines are were all set up when we had another fish on and off pretty quick and then a small shaker to the boat. Then things went quite for a while.  Feeling OK with the time we had spent together with a bit of fish action, sharing some stories, getting caught up and having lots of laughs, when the suddenly the dispey goes screaming out. I grab the rod and pass it to Hannah who then is begging for help as this brute peels off more then 100ft of line. After some great rod handling and coaching the fish is in the net. A couple of shots and back she went. Pretty awesome salmon for her first one ever!!    We trolled for another hour and lost one smaller fish while pulling lines at the end of the trip. An awesome evening with some awesome people.  Here's a couple more shots of the evening.  Nik at the helm. Figured if he can handle a 42ft sailboat from Vancouver to Malaysia without incident he can handle my 17fter.     Some very happy fisher people.          Watching the sunset as the moon is rising over my shoulder.     And a beautiful sunset it was. A perfect end to the weekend.      Till the next time!!"

718731,Spiel,2012-07-30 11:29:00,9065,"Very nice Will and a beauty fish too.  I take it you were running Dipseys (or something), I don't see any riggers?"
718736,Fish Farmer,2012-07-30 11:44:00,2234,"Way to go will. Getting friends out fishing and catching is a bonus. That's something, having friends sailing around the world, very impressive.  I wish them a very safe journey."
718739,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-30 12:02:00,2690,Looks like a great way to spend an evening Will.  Those smiles say it all!!
718743,Joey,2012-07-30 12:20:00,9122,Very nice Will
718749,Rod Caster,2012-07-30 13:03:00,5784,pretty awesome first salmon indeed!!
718751,Headhunter,2012-07-30 13:08:00,5703,"I was sitting on my front porch last night thinking... man, perfect night to out on the big lake... then  saw this... Awesome report bud! Seet fish and fantastic pics... nice job!  HH"
718781,fishnsled,2012-07-30 15:32:00,3520," No riggers, dipseys on the corners and leadcore out on the boards. I've been playing with the idea of getting a pair of riggers for years. For the number of times I go out, it's tough to justify the money. (I'd want electrics. ) One of these days I might just throw in the towel and get a pair.    It's pretty amazing the things they have seen. We get excited when a fish jumps when we are fishing, they've had whales breaching off the back of their boat, can only imagine that happening. I believe I posted this a while about but thought I'd share it again. A very small part of the journey they had.      It was the perfect evening on the lake Joe. I don't know how many times we said that.  Weather was awesome, the lake was playing nice and the fish were biting.  Thanks for the replies everyone."

719191,Fish Farmer,2012-07-31 19:41:00,2234,"Thanks Will, but the link didn't work on my end, unless it's my CP that won't let me see it. Thanks any way. I'm sure their journey is something else"
