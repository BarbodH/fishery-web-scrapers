718606,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-29 19:12:00,540,"Hey, up at the trailer and nobody has minnows.  My son really wants to catch some perch... any good alternatives?"
718608,davey buoy,2012-07-29 19:15:00,5505, Worms by far!!!!!.
718609,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-29 19:15:00,540,"Sorry, if it helps...Lake Erie"
718610,gino,2012-07-29 19:15:00,400,gulp alive minnows works good
718611,BillM,2012-07-29 19:18:00,17367,The Berkley PowerBait Crappie tubes are killer for any panfish...
718612,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-29 19:18:00,540,"I know this may annoy some, but if Im on a school and catch one, can I use pieces of it to catch more?  I have had them snub gulp minnows before"
718616,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-29 19:32:00,540,"Sorry, checked the regs on that, definitely a no no."
718619,Christopheraaron,2012-07-29 19:36:00,3525,Worms work but you'll catch a good number of sunnies aswell.
718630,BillM,2012-07-29 20:05:00,17367, Not many sunfish in Lake Erie.
718631,Terry,2012-07-29 20:12:00,14456," On simcoe the COs said you can use the eyes and any parts you would not eat, as long as you kill the fish and keep it as part of your limit"
718633,davey buoy,2012-07-29 20:49:00,5505,"Try worms?,best for perch by far!!!"
718644,fishboy,2012-07-29 22:22:00,550,yep worms with a slip float
718654,adempsey,2012-07-29 22:56:00,1498,"Definitely worms, but I frequently use plastics (especially ice fishing).  Gulp Alive Fish Fry 1""   Gulp Alive Waxies   Powerbait Maggots   Powerbait Honey Worms   Microtubes 1.5"" - 2"" "
718677,danbouck,2012-07-30 00:14:00,4380,Anything that resembles an emerald for Erie. Small gulp minnows work best when live minnows aren't available
718679,eman,2012-07-30 00:21:00,101, I haven't done this since i was a kid and I'm just curious as to why this would be? Could you use one whole as a bait for something like pike?
718682,danc,2012-07-30 00:32:00,4677,"I used to catch tons of Perch on raw bacon as a kid. Not sure if the Perch are on to it now, but it worked 40 years ago."
718686,mike rousseau,2012-07-30 00:49:00,4661,"Pink ""fin S"" minnows....  Or 2.5 inch gulp minnows....  Or micro tubes  Or micro twisters   And berkley honey worms are really good....   ..."
718930,Live2fish85,2012-07-31 01:11:00,1633,"Worms are useless on Erie for perch. Minnows are really what you want, other baits will not work out to well.  Where about are you I may be able to help you find some."
718937,mercman,2012-07-31 01:37:00,7054," Still works Dan, and Gobies dont like it as much, so it lasts longer.Also used pieces of hotdog wieners."
718957,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-31 02:27:00,540,"Lowbanks.  A guy in Dunnville has some, but is charging $5 a dozen!!!  If you could help that would be awesome!"
718963,Cudz,2012-07-31 03:05:00,2652,You may use a part of the perch for bait.  Do not use a part of the perch that you would eat.  Also you must keep the perch the you cut up and keep the flesh to eat. use belly strips and eyes. Legal as long as you don't damage edible flesh and you keep the fish.
719001,smally21,2012-07-31 11:44:00,993,"minnows are my first choice, the smallest gulp minnows work if they are active you just need to be on with hook sets cuz they dont stick around.  i agree that worms dont work well on the parts of erie i fish, cant explain why.  as a back up bait we bring some shrimp off a cheap shrimp ring, and cut pieces off. or get salad shrimp and use full size. the best part of this bait is its clean, easy to handle and lasts for multiple fish..."
719047,Rich,2012-07-31 14:02:00,3927,lol... minnows should be the fallback alternative to your perch techniques..
719048,fishnsled,2012-07-31 14:07:00,3520, Have to agree with this. Haven't bought minnows in years for perch fishing.
