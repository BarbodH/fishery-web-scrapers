718796,Millhouse2020,2012-07-30 16:29:00,152,  Funny but some board members would consider that day a bust since you didn't catch your intended species.  I on the other hand feel very differently.  Nice catch!
718798,BillM,2012-07-30 16:36:00,17367, What were the water temps like?  Maybe they've gone a lot deeper.
718799,Millhouse2020,2012-07-30 16:37:00,152,"For fishing deeper structures with a spinnerbait, I do like a single bladed colorado in a 3/4 to 1 ounce weight or heavier if possible or depth is over 20 feet.  Although the colorado does create more lift than the willow leaf, it spins better at slow speed and will spin well while sinking or helicoptoring down.  Willow leaf blades don't do this as well and a double willow sometimes will not spin at all when falling.  I'm sure the Idiana blade would be a good option for this as well and certainly better than a willow leaf type blade.   Don't discount deep diving crankbaits either.  They will slay pike if you can keep them from snagging.  In fact if you can get the baits hitting the bottom or other structure its a great attracting and triggering technique for pike."
718806,NAW,2012-07-30 16:59:00,4022, That's what I was thinking.  I can't remember what the water temp (edit) was.  At what temp would they move out of the 15 - 20' range?  And how deep would they move to?
718807,BillM,2012-07-30 17:14:00,17367, I was catching them on 12-18ft edges when the water was in the mid 70's.... I imagine it's a lot warmer now.
718931,msp,2012-07-31 01:12:00,1336,"That sounds awesome. If you show me how to catch 5 pound bass every trip out out, I will show you how to catch pike at will !!  At this time of year the big pike will be in much deeper water. Focus on spoons such as Johnsons silver minnows and reel them very slow off the deeper edges of weed lines"
718981,musky66,2012-07-31 10:15:00,273, Really deep- was on Muskoka two weeks back and surface temps were close to 79 F- not even hammer handles were shallow. All pIke came at least 15' down. I troll deep diving cranks with the best being the older Berkley Frenzy's- although a tough old Pike can wreck one of those pretty good. I troll the breakline around 20' but also catch them suspended over 40' depths or more. If I wanted a real 30 lber out of Muskoka I would be working big shiners on bottom in 40' ( Gravenhurst Bay)- would be slow but I have seen some big hooks right on bottom....
719045,Rich,2012-07-31 13:59:00,3927,"Every lake is different, but pike are pike.  8 - 12 ft is what I would consider shallow pike fishing, anywhere. In that depth range you can catch them on shallow running lures, year round. Provided they are in the area. Unfortunately there is a large part of the day that pike, especially bigger ones, just don't feed. Unless you happen to get your bait 5 inches from their face and make it look half dead, you probably won't hook a lot of fish.  Patience and perseverance is the only trick to summertime fishing.  Oh, or you can use dead bait under a float which works year round, and catches the biggest pike in the lake."
719121,hungryforpike,2012-07-31 17:01:00,46,Feels like I certainly needed to find deeper water..had a rental boat with no fish finder...think i'll grab a mobile one for such trips.     
719123,hungryforpike,2012-07-31 17:03:00,46,It never would have dawned on me to use a bobber and dead bait..what would be on the hook?? Dead sunfish? Minnows? Just get it near bottom and leave it there?     
719134,Millhouse2020,2012-07-31 17:31:00,152,"   Deadbait fishing is common throughout Europe and is the generally preferred method of catching BIG pike.  For some reason a lot of people in NorthAmerica shun this type of fishing, not sure why.  I love using bobbers for all kinds of fish, its fun and most of all very effective.    You cannot use just any bait, regulations can vary throughout the province.  Suckers would be fine anywhere.  Where legal, oily fish like smelt, ciscos or herring would be best, they give off more scent and pike love them.  For large baits, you would likely want to switch to some type of quick strike rig to get the best hooking potential.  Its basically a rig designed to suspend a bait horizontally with a hook in the front (usually head) and one in the back (usually behind the dorsal fin).  Pike normally strike a bait sideways and this allows you to set the hook immediately instead of waiting for the fish to swallow the bait if you were using only one hook.    Hope this helps."
718531,hungryforpike,2012-07-29 04:22:00,46,"Greetings all,    so today i had a full day on the water with a few buddies up at Lake Dalrymple. I normally fish bass at my cottage in Haliburton, so when i go to Dalrymple we always want to pull pike. I have been to the lake a couple times this year... literally as pike and bass opened and had some good spots nailed down..largely in part to some good feedback on this board. Today was supposed to be all about pulling pike again, in the past this season I have had great luck pulling some good sized pike from this lake.  This weekend, as happens so often; the lake had totally changed. The water was way down, previous hot spots were out of the water and could not be fished and the pike (with all this heat) were simply not in the shallows(of course). So we were fishing deeper water, weed beds in 8-12ft of water, which for Dalrymple is pretty deep. Managed to yank a few small pike, but very little action on the pike side of things overall. Now, understanding of course that nothing is absolute and every lake is different, I am curious to know what everyone is using/likes to use to target pike sitting in deep water for these sorts of conditions? Or what the consensus is on the best means of finding where these guys go when the water is so hot. The highly recommended ""husky jerk"" lures we brought were a total bust today, deep and shallow. As usual, thanks everyone..    HFP"
718540,davey buoy,2012-07-29 10:22:00,5505," Yesterday,using white 3/8 and 1/2oz spinners baits real slow,and another awesome pike day. Give them a fair try."
718543,Roy,2012-07-29 10:40:00,13728,"I'm old school and when it comes to pike and especially in a pressured area, I'll use anything shiny. The best thing you can use is something like a Toronto wobbler. It's an easy bait to use and once you've found their depth, you can then switch to whatever you like.....if it moves, it's food."
718544,bushart,2012-07-29 11:24:00,2628,"""Key"" spots are only a guideline  Use your electronics---locate the food source(concentrations of baitfish)you'll usually find preds nearby  spots are where you find this scenario--could be  deep/shallow/suspended  Your then choice of lure will be what is able to blow by their nose"
718555,outllaw,2012-07-29 12:48:00,1232,"years back,we used shiners lip hooked on a float. when the floats moving off count athousand 1 to 10. set the hook. large pike need to turn the bait before they swallow. ,like i said that was years back for large deep pike."
718556,hungryforpike,2012-07-29 12:49:00,46,Sounds like i may need some heavier spinners..thanks guys.     
718558,bushart,2012-07-29 13:06:00,2628, Unfortunately I've caught many gators in my life in the 15+ range  I say unfortunately as I look at them as a pain when I'm fishin bass/walleye  Biggest one I've ever had beside the boat was about 9-10 years ago----absolute monster----fall fishin Eyes---caught on 1/4 oz jig and worm---had to push 30lbs  He was in there gobblin up these nuisance rock bass that were set up on a rock ledge---baitfish---key
718559,Rod Caster,2012-07-29 13:08:00,5784,"Lovin' the paddle tails with xtra-strong jigs lately.  This one is 1/4oz, but 1/2oz would get you even deeper if jigging in the wind.  "
718562,bushart,2012-07-29 13:40:00,2628,Hey Rod Caster  Can Ya lend me 20 bucks till my brother gets a better job
718563,hungryforpike,2012-07-29 13:44:00,46,Funny you mentioned the paddle tails on the way home this was what we were talking about getting to try and get deep while doing so weedless. Looks like another trip to Sail..   
718565,hungryforpike,2012-07-29 13:49:00,46,"Hilarious, one mans trash is another mans treasure. I having been pulling 5lbs + bass all season, pretty much every week..no problems. Now when I'm fishing pike.. the bass are getting in the way..  While stalking pike yesterday, I yanked a 5.7 pound large mouth.     "
718567,Rod Caster,2012-07-29 14:24:00,5784," Yes, and it will only cost you $5 upfront!"
718569,BillM,2012-07-29 14:27:00,17367," Yup, been working very well for me this year.."
718643,nelsonj,2012-07-29 22:22:00,3,"   Goodness, a pain? I'd trade a whole boatload of smallmouth or walleye for a 15+ pike, let alone a 30 pounder. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'd go the with spinner suggestion, slow, like a couple guys said, along the weed edge. Red and White combination is always good, or a yellow/green one. On days I want to spin it slow, I use those with a round, Colorado blade, instead of a long and narrow spinner blade. The round ones tend to go slower and add more thump to the bait as you reel it in, sinking it a bit deeper and putting it right in front of the big guys' noses.  I'm also partial to casting heavy spoons when I'm trying to get deeper, ones with a natural wobble that you don't have to reel too fast for them to look good. Try a Little Cleo, silver spoon. I've had more success with that type than just about any other lure."
718650,BillM,2012-07-29 22:43:00,17367,"If you want to run deep with a spinnerbait, you definitely want willow leaf blades over colorado's...."
718652,bushart,2012-07-29 22:48:00,2628,KVD Tip  Take the rubber out of a rubber core sinker and crimp it ahead of your spinnerbait head to bulk it up
718653,davey buoy,2012-07-29 22:50:00,5505," Why not just a heavy crimp sinker?,without rubber?. I literally have hundreds."
718659,davey buoy,2012-07-29 23:20:00,5505," Indiana blades?,Do tell!!,never heard of them."
718662,nelsonj,2012-07-29 23:32:00,3," They're a bit of a combination between the two; an uneven oval, like a tablespoon shape."
718683,eman,2012-07-30 00:37:00,101,Try swimbaits and paddle tails on 1/2oz to 1oz jigs depending on depth. Weighted hooks will also work for weedier areas. Carolina rig a lizard will work well too. And an old school method that still works is a 4 to 5 inch grub (chanteuse or white my favorite) on a heavy jig.
718712,hungryforpike,2012-07-30 04:04:00,46,"I seems like I just did not have the right bait for the environment..I think some old school spoons, a variety of spinner baits and some big paddle tails should solve the problem. I guess we'll see next weekend."
718760,bubbles,2012-07-30 14:03:00,591,"William Spoons are my favorite, easily pull fish out of 12-15' of water with them."
718765,NAW,2012-07-30 14:14:00,4022,I fished 15 to 20' on G-Pool all day Sunday and got skunked on pike  :wallbash:  Tried all of the above exept for a Williams wobler.  Nada.  8 bass though.
718766,BillM,2012-07-30 14:20:00,17367," Gotta find those weed edges, GPool is littered with pike."
718775,NAW,2012-07-30 15:00:00,4022," That's the funny thing.  I fished there 2 weeks ago.  Weed edges, 15'.  Caught 5 pike in an hour and half.  This week, fished the exact same weed beds.  Nothing.  One big follow turned away boat side.  We did see some massive snapping turtles."
