718986,The Urban Fisherman,2012-07-31 11:01:00,2050,"I hit up the lake alone early yesterday evening, meaning without the kids for the first time since bass opener.  I only fished give or take 45 minutes and do I ever wish I could have stayed out longer because they were hungry!  I'm sure if I kept going into the late evening I would have eventually cracked off a giant... BUT the house was calling as it's officially on the market and needs a few things checked off the to-do list.  Started off picking up a half dozen or so of these little guys on deep weed flats...    Then decided to hit up some more defined structure....it didn't seem to matter which kind of cover it was, as long as I was right in tight I was getting a bite!  Spinnerbaits and flippin' jigs were the trick tonight.. no big giants but good fun for a short time on the water! Here's a couple of the better ones...    I have a giant smile on this one because he had me wrapped right around a tree for a solid minute before I managed to drag him out..    Have a good week!  Cheers, Ryan"
