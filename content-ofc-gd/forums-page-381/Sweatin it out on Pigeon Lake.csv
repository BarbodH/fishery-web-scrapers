We realized we wouldn't be alone when passing through Bridgenorth; I guess a bass tourney was in town, I've never seen so many bass boats in my life! It was definitely cool to see these impressive machines fly across the water, also nice to discover some inconspicuous fishing spots that seemed to get a lot of attention from these guys that I've passed over so many times before...  Did I mention it was HOT! water temps at the surface were 76 degrees. Boat traffic in general was the highest I've ever seen it out there. I managed to snap ONE shot without a boat  zipping through the scenery.    We spent the majority of our time trolling the lake without too much to show for.    At around 10am this girl decide to take my bait while trolling the top of Pigeon.    By 2 we were exhausted from the heat and ready to head back. Can't wait for the fall!  "
