718561,Rod Caster,2012-07-29 13:28:00,5784,"Yes, the weekend is not over yet. But I'm sunbaked and vacuuming was supposed to get done yesterday  The wife-to-be and I visited Nipissing on Friday night and enjoyed a fantastic sunset on calm waters. We pulled in a couple walleye, but the fishing was slow overall.        Yesterday, my brother was in a canoe race so my father and I met up with him at the designated portage and gave him a few peanut butter sandwiches, which he slammed down before heading across Talon Lake.      After the race, Dad and I launched the canoe and trolling motor on a nearby lake looking for whatever would bite in the mid-day sun. I've fished this lake many times, caught a couple big pike on it, but in general, this lake just teases me with huge bites and missed fish! This time I found a shoreline filled with big smallies and largies. We managed 6 fish in our short trip. Most around 3.5-4lbs (guessing). Dad kept three for din-din.     Last night, in redemption of the slow Nipissing outing on Friday, me and fiance travelled north to a hotspot for walleye. As is always the case, the setting sun triggers the walleye big time! Sarah was first up with a good fish followed by a barrage of non-stop action. We kept 6 to fill our limit and got a few pictures of the nicer ones.  She bought some ""Simon-pink"" fish handling gloves, but she keeps forgetting them. This time I convinced her to hold it for a photo....  I think she did very well.          Thanks for stopping in."

718572,Rod Caster,2012-07-29 14:42:00,5784, Ha. I know exactly where you speak of  Maybe if you narrowed it down to 3kms I could figure it out.
718593,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-29 16:46:00,2690,Looks like a great weekend Chad!!!
718617,gino,2012-07-29 19:33:00,400,"nice! I'll go camping near Port Franks on Huron for about a week, will try some fishing on the big lake, see if i can get in to some smallmouth or something..."
718625,Joey,2012-07-29 19:55:00,9122,Sweet!!!
718920,Joeytier,2012-07-31 00:15:00,3990,"Ahh yes, the white grub...how I love thee, and that lake..."
718926,Live2fish85,2012-07-31 00:47:00,1633,Nice work. Sounds like a nice weekend.
718929,Rod Caster,2012-07-31 01:00:00,5784, You recognized it! Now give me your eyes
718932,fishnsled,2012-07-31 01:14:00,3520," I've never threatened to take out their eyes before, going to have to keep that one file for future fishing trips.  Great report Chad."
719010,Rod Caster,2012-07-31 12:15:00,5784," Haha The way Joey catches fish out of my canoe, he gets a lot of threats.  To round out the weekend, we were catching walleye in 5 feet of water....mid day, full sun! horrible photo i know. Recognize this one, Joey?  "
719137,Leecher,2012-07-31 17:37:00,7832,You got the walleyes figured out pretty well this season Chad   Good job    you two
719167,NAW,2012-07-31 19:07:00,4022,Nice report Chad.  Maybe I missed a few of your previous posts...When did you pick up the Minkota for the Sportspal?
719201,Rod Caster,2012-07-31 20:16:00,5784," A bit of a funny story...  When I bought the canoe, it came with an old MotorGuide Circa 1988. I never really got to use it, because I never bothered picking up a good battery. Well, this year I go all out and buy a Quaker State Deep Cycle, ready to rock! First trip out and ZAP, there goes my motorOff to CT, spend $150 and I'm into a MinnKota haha. So far so good...I've never been so lazy and I'm loving it!!"
719209,Joeytier,2012-07-31 20:24:00,3990,You forgot the best part about having to paddle home thru a pop-up windstorm the same day you fried it.
719220,mercman,2012-07-31 20:50:00,7054,Looks like a great couple of days.Some beautiful places up in Gods Country:clapping:    Tite Lines Bud     Paul
719222,Rod Caster,2012-07-31 20:55:00,5784," Oh ya haha. Had paddle back alone, in the dark, with the dead weight of a battery and trolling motor  I was impressed."
