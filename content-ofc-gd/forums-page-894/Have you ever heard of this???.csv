307785,Headhunter,2009-02-18 13:44:00,5703,"Ok... we had a thread on this topic a number of years ago. I like the O.P., wasn't sure what the laws were, so I called the Ministry. You can use the eyes or parts of any fish, as long as it was legally caught and intended to be kept. This includes game fish. You are not allowed to use the whole fish (gamefish) but any part can be used as bait. Just be sure to have your ""parts"" fish in a state that it can be properly dressed, for consumption. That means that you could use pike eyes, whitie eyes, virtually any fish in season. Removing the eyes is pretty simple if you have the right tool. I have used a pencil, with a wire loop attached to the bottom. The key is to keep the eye in as good shape as possible, so it lasts longer on the hook. HH"
307810,wallyboss,2009-02-18 14:47:00,1095, So if i bring home a few walleyes one day and decide to keep the butterfly (under the jaw area) I can then use this as bait on folowing outings?? Or just if I have the rest of the walleye with me??
307811,Headhunter,2009-02-18 14:55:00,5703,I believe you can use it wallyboss. HH
307813,wallyboss,2009-02-18 14:58:00,1095,How long as this been okay??Or has it always been okay?I am pretty sure that it is illegal in Quebec.
307818,web-fisherman,2009-02-18 15:08:00,54,"Gosh,  Please intend on keeping the fish before you start using the eyes. Not lately, but I have seen several perch sitting on the ice with no eyes and nobody around. Hate when I run into that. What a waste."
307823,Leecher,2009-02-18 15:28:00,7832," Dan,  I checked the regs for QC and it's not legal.... here is an excerpt   Jacques"
307828,Headhunter,2009-02-18 15:44:00,5703,"As I said Web-Fisherman, you must keep the fish (game fish) and not allow it to spoil on the ice. It will count as part of your daily limit. Should you talk some fish home, remove the eyes and then, at another date, use the eyes, you should be ok, as long as you leave a piece of skin on any fish you have at home inyour freezer. Should you not have any fish in your possession, then you should still be good. HH  Ps... anyone have any musky eyes lying around! Lol!"
307860,Canuck2fan,2009-02-18 17:42:00,1444, I wonder how the limit is affected when you are back out fishing with cured perch eyes. Say you have 40 perch eyes left as bait which equals 20 fish and then you catch 35 new perch when a CO happens along? Are you going to get a fine or a nice pat on the back since you technically over your limit at that point.
307872,Headhunter,2009-02-18 18:08:00,5703,"The eyes don't count on your limit... the fish does though. In that case, you can have all the eyes you want, just don't go over the possession limit. HH"
307885,wallyboss,2009-02-18 18:53:00,1095,I thought so that it wasn't legal in Quebec.
307888,Guest gbfisher,2009-02-18 19:07:00,0,  The great thing about Perch eyes is that you only need 10 or so to bag a limit of 50 with plenty going back down the hole. No wet hands from using minnows. Only wet hands from catching Perch.. The eyes will not count against you limit...... Hope this helps...
308016,blakewalk,2009-02-19 00:27:00,86,"Agreed, a pop on the head should do it. what else off a perch works well? might as well make use of everything."
308032,mukluk,2009-02-19 00:49:00,196,News to me. Any special way of hooking the eye ball on the hook? Would the eye not collapse when hooked?
308116,holdfast,2009-02-19 04:11:00,1813,From what I remember just hook it through the centre and pull it out.  No Special techniques.  Also surprisingly that eye will stay on usually after many fish.  Every Once in a while the eye will disintegrate.
308388,codfather,2009-02-19 23:37:00,8,"I've heard about using perch eye's many times and know guy's that swear by them.I've also trid to use them myself.My question is how do you remove the eye from the fish.I've only tried by using a hook to poke it out,but to no avail. Do you guy's use a knife to remove the eye or wait until it's frozen.  Greg"
308395,bigugli,2009-02-19 23:43:00,6138,"I also use eyeballs for catching smelt through the ice.  You can pop the eyeball out.  Press down behind and under the  eyeball  and it will pop out. Occasionaly  you'll mess up,  it just takes practice."
307286,Cudz,2009-02-17 03:38:00,2652,"My friend was out on Sunday and between 8 of them using live minnows, they manage about 20 perch.  In the same amount of time a guy and his 2 friends limit out with 150 perch.  My buddy goes over to see what they are using and the guy shows him a small jigging spoon but on the treble he attaches an eyeball from a perch!?!?!?! What??? Yeah eyeballs from the perch they caught moments earlier.  What is that all about?  My buddy says they didn't even jig the spoons, just let them sit and immediately, bam, another perch.  Is this a common practice? Is this even legal?"
307291,irishfield,2009-02-17 03:45:00,26272,"All Leah's Opa ever used !  Legal.. probably not these days.  IN 2006 they were trying to make any fish parts illegal as they did with any fish over 5.1"" for bait on Lake Temagami.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/STEL02_178932.pdf"
307292,OhioFisherman,2009-02-17 03:45:00,6623,"It`s legal here in Ohio, if your keeping the fish to eat anyway why wouldn`t it be? Also used to cut small strips of the white belly, scale them and use for more perch. Also used to cut emerald shiners in half."
307294,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-17 03:48:00,2585,yeah i dont see why it would be illegal but if pam and friends get a hold of that i can see the ad now lol  cheers!
307296,purekgw,2009-02-17 03:51:00,585,i have heard of people doing that i guess it must work
307300,Guest gbfisher,2009-02-17 03:53:00,0,100% legal. Nothing wrong with using the eyeballs from the perch you took or are taking home. I cure them myself. Best bait goin for Perch. Using the whole fish for bait is 100% illegal though.
307304,nancur373,2009-02-17 04:05:00,1211,"Did that for trout in Newfoundland all the time. Where I come from worms were hard to come by. Turn over a few rocks to find a worm, bug, or anything that a trout would bite. Sometimes we had to use buds from a nearby tree. The trick was to get the first one. After that it was eyeballs and guts the rest of the day. And mighty successful I might add.  Curt"
307308,Dnthmn,2009-02-17 04:12:00,128,Common practice for me once the shiners are gone.
307310,jwl,2009-02-17 04:17:00,1056,"used to do that all the time when I was a little kid, if we rode our bikes to a fishing hole, and started running out of bait,if we where keeping a few fish to bring home we would do that, first was the eyes, then little belly strips.  I have also used belly strip from perch as a sort of ""jig'npig"" or""sluggo"" kind of baits for pike fishing,it's awesome watching the white strip go through the water, then a green flash and no more bait....set the hook and ya..hoooo!!!"
307312,drwxr,2009-02-17 04:19:00,453,"thats what i tip most of my lures: spoons, lil foxess, jigging raps. works wonders. i think its so successful cause the eye is smaller than a minnow and is easier to swallow."
307334,BassAsin,2009-02-17 05:27:00,806,used perch balls for bait for years with my dad on the north channel fishin jumbos in 40 FOW
307338,steverowbotham,2009-02-17 06:32:00,1800,"i always do it once i run out of bait, works wonders"
307362,holdfast,2009-02-17 12:53:00,1813,"We used to do that all the time in lake Champlain Vermont.  Not on a jig but just a hook and sinker.  Funny thing though, they would not bite if they were Bass or Punkinseed eyes.  If you want to argue if it was legal back then ask the old guy that lived there most of the year who taught me that, who's been dead a long time ago.  God rest his soul, He was a Prince of a man.  Taught me all about fishing and the outdoors."
307370,SlowPoke,2009-02-17 13:33:00,2984,How do you sort the males from the females?
307395,Zubris21,2009-02-17 15:21:00,563,"Never done it myself, but a couple of years ago saw a guy catching large spring panfish one after another using perch eyeballs.  Meanwhile my friend and I went home with maybe a dozen dinks in a couple hours using micro tubes."
307398,Joeytier,2009-02-17 15:29:00,3990,I must try this.
307425,BassAsin,2009-02-17 16:33:00,806,Hahahah
307426,ozaibak1,2009-02-17 16:41:00,401,"Hell yeah it's legal!  The first time I found out about this technique, it was by accident! Was fishing pigeon lake on a slow day, caught a perch it unhooked just leaving its eyeball, I used that as bait thinking 'what the hell,' and the action picked right up it was on fire!"
307605,Cudz,2009-02-18 00:15:00,2652,Ok so it is legal. I will give it a try.  I must admit that I will kill the perch before I will remove its eye.  I think that is only fair. lol
307644,Abberz,2009-02-18 01:41:00,140,If you've ever ran out of bait when panfish are biting this works great....it could have been they were on top of a hump or something and you guys weren't....even though you were close that made all the difference no matter what bait was being used.
307651,misfish,2009-02-18 01:50:00,29133,"  So I hook the perch throuh the EYE BALLL,and a pike takes it,am I still legal??????? J/K Bro.  I was brought up on eyes and herring.  Heres another for ya. Cut thin slices of a perch throut. Nice bait for crappie."
307661,paulyboy83,2009-02-18 02:10:00,54,What's the best way to remove the eyeball?  PB
307682,bigugli,2009-02-18 03:09:00,6138,Push your thumb up under the socket and the eyeball will pop. Also a great bait for smelts.
307684,Cudz,2009-02-18 03:12:00,2652,"Ok so am i reading this right.  I am allowed to catch a perch and cut pieces of perch to use as bait?  Is that correct, or am I just allowed to use certain parts of the perch.  I tried doing a search but failed to come up with an thorough answer."
307702,pike slayer,2009-02-18 04:13:00,1177,i've heard of ppl doing this but i havent done it myself. i've also heard of ppl cutting some skin off a lake trout and putting that on your hook worked wonders but i never tried it. this past weekend i was fishing with a buddy and he had chunks of lake trout belly/skin that he was jigging with getting lakers. is what he was doing illegal?
