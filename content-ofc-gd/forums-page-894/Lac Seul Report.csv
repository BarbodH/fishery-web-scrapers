I have fished here a few times on open water and its awesome for all sorts of fish.   The first spot we hit was a narrows in around 25 FOW....buckshots and plain jigs were the tackle....with plain jigs...especially glow winning out in the end. No sooner than setting up my set line went...lookd like a good pull....but never connected. Then the perch kept us busy for 15 minurtes before the bite died. Half hour later the walleye showed. We got around 5 before the bite stopped again.      I THINK THIS WAS THE BEST ONE OF THE DAY   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/Movielac1.flv"">      MY LITTLE GUY        THE BOYS WITH THEIRS                     After a quie spell....the whitefish moved in, I LOVE CATCHING WHITEFISH!!!! Graham started us off with a real monster at around 26"", Ben followed up ith another big one around 24"". I got 2 in Quick succession moments later. I think graham got another soon after that.        NICE BIG WHITIE FOR GRAHAM   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/Movielac4.flv"">       BEN FOLLOWED THAT WITH ANOTHER LARGE WHITIE          I GOT A COUPLE IN QUICK SUCCESSION..dunno why i'm almost upside down in this clip....darn cameraman...lol  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/lac6.flv"">       GRAHAM'S 2ND         COUPLE MORE SHOTS OF THE SAME FISH          I CAN ADD A SMALLSH 21"" WHITIE FOR TEAM #3        The bite pretty much died after that...i think the guys got a walleye or 2 after that...and a few jackfish. We moved on to another spot after that. On arrival Ben found some treasure....a really cool pair of shades.......which he wore a little longer that either Graham or mydself were comfortable with...lol...just kiddin' Ben.      ELTON JOHN ICEFISHING?        The depth was a little shallower than our first stop, around 18-22 FOW. Jigs and minnows still the weapon of choie. The perch were a real nuisance...especially with the set lines....but we got a few more keeper size walleye. I got into the Tullibees for around half an hour and iced 5 or 6 which Graham and Ben kept for deadbaiting pike.  All three of us lost at least one big Jackfish, and iced a few smaller ones too. I had a hit and snap off at 8' deep and so tried higher up the water column again amonst the tulibee and got a pike on a micro tube...never had a pike hit that high up the water column whilst ice fishing before...which was kinda neat...also did not expect it to hit a micro tube on 1/8 Oz jig.     THE PERCH WERE BUSY  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/Movielac13.flv"">     WE GOT A FEW MORE KEEPER WALLEYE        TULIBEES CAME OUT TO PLAY       ALL OF US LOST A FEW BIGGER JACKFISH   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/Movielac20.flv"">     BEN GOT THE BEST OF THE PIKE  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/Movielac18.flv"">          WE ALL GOT A FEW THIS SIZE TOO         THIS ONE HIT AT 8' DEEP IN 20' FOW.....IT WHACKED A MICRO TUBE I HAD ON FOR TULIBEE/WHITEFISH!!

Too bad there wasn't any big walleye in the mix, but let us know when you can come back and hopefully we can get you on a bigger walleye.    Next time I'll let you wear my lucky ice fishing sun glasses    Can't believe someone left that pair of performance eye wear on the ice."
308229,ccmtcanada,2009-02-19 15:26:00,7971,So who was the potty mouth anyways??? LOL
308239,trapshooter,2009-02-19 15:54:00,1234,lets just say Graham and I were a little surprised to see the size of the whitey that came up the hole.      AND the camera man didn't give us any warning that he was 'rolling tape'.
308245,ehg,2009-02-19 16:02:00,2666,"Great multi-species ice fishing report. Those whitefish are big. Nice report as usual, like the videos!"
308270,limeyangler,2009-02-19 17:01:00,5204," The camera man is also in charge of editing...lol...and the very last words on the clip were cut...that would be me declaring...""that is a big whitie"".....lol."
308276,trapshooter,2009-02-19 17:26:00,1234, You should left that in and beeped the whole clip from start to finish.
