307987,walleyejigger,2009-02-18 23:28:00,876,"i'm so over the ctc sales it's not even funny,  my local store's big sale this week is a plastic plano storage box reg. $7.00  for 50% off, and the cordless rapala knife 50% off, good deal on THOSE items, but hardly a fishing sale or clearance, last week they had sorel winter boots for 50% off, not one store in sudbury, esponala or timmins had a single pair, (6 stores.......ZERO boots) what the heck, (I called all those stores on the thursday before the sale started, and visited 2 of them later in the week, the 2 i visited didn't even have a spot to sell the boots)"
307991,tinbanger,2009-02-18 23:35:00,1028, and thanks again for that tip Cudz
308027,blakewalk,2009-02-19 00:45:00,86,Nice! thanks for the heads up!
308232,carp-starter,2009-02-19 15:43:00,253,"Surprise, surprise, amazing how many would spend $$ on gas to get something on sale where the price is already low in the first place. Then to find out that it is not available.  I would not buy even split shot at CTC. But once in a while when I see a CTC ad of something that I should buy and at a good price, I buy it.  I was going to rent a tree pruner this spring. I have a bad back and so I would have to rent it a number of times. On Oct 1/8 I saw a CTC ad for tree pruners - Fiskar, regular price was $69.99, sale price was $34.99, 1/2 off. So I went to the store on Oct 2/8 to buy one. They did not have it in stock. Lady SAID THAT NONE OF THE STORE HAD IT IN STOCK. So that was it for me - can't do much. But before I walked away, the lady said that I can get a ""rain check"" - first time for me. I was given the next delivery date.  I phoned in a couple of weeks on the so-called new delivery date and there was none delivered. I would check online and the results were screwy. When online showed ""in stock"" the store had none. I kept checking on the delivery dates that I was given and every time they had none.  On Jan 27/9 I checked the online and the pruners were in stock. Confirmed by phone and went the next day and bought it. It took me a bit of time but I have a good buy and it will be cheaper than renting one.  Also, the price went up for 2009.  There is someone here who wanted to buy a pair of Sorel boots. For boots, I think he could have gotten a rain check. I think one would not be able to get a rain check for items sold from a BIN.  Get rain checks if you are serious in buying and it is worth a bit of a hassle.  carp-starter"
308238,GBW,2009-02-19 15:53:00,8460,"you can get a rain check for any item that they are going to bring in more stock.  If the item is end of life then there is no way you can get one as the odds are slim they are going to get stock.  This is the case with MOST stores, all you have to do is ask.  Well, I've heard Walmart doesn't but many others do..."
305584,FISHINGNUT,2009-02-12 22:51:00,253,Just a heads up got this weeks Canadian tire flyer today 50-75% off selected fishing items
305611,GeorgeJ,2009-02-12 23:19:00,207,"thanks I will be checking it out, last week the local CT had a couple of CLEAROUT bins full of fishing lures jigs etc. marked way down at least 50%. I didn't realize what a well equipped tackle box costs to set up so now I'm a big fan of SALES!"
305630,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-12 23:39:00,2585,thanks i will check out the local ct for some deals  cheers!
305648,motv8tr,2009-02-12 23:59:00,2587,I doubt my local store will have much available...they were pretty low on stock to begin with the other day  Maureen
306277,FISHINGNUT,2009-02-14 11:50:00,253,I am dressed and ready to go 1hr 10 min till they open
306286,lew,2009-02-14 13:02:00,12766,"I hope you find what your lookin for, cause from alot of recent threads about CTC sales, it seems many folks are heading to the stores only to find that nobody is carrying any of the advertised sale products......me included"
306288,GeorgeJ,2009-02-14 13:09:00,207,I was so excited I went to two different CT's to get a head start yesterday but there wasn't much tagged with those bright orange stickers we all like to see so much. Hopefully staff was there all night tagging and the fishing section will glow orange with sale tags today!
306295,Marko,2009-02-14 13:25:00,854,"Just came back from Canadian tire and there wasn't much on sale really. Few combos were on sale but most of them are gone already, and few tackle boxes were 50% off as well. I was hoping to find a decent reel but i didn't see any red tagged."
306312,FISHINGNUT,2009-02-14 14:27:00,253,Wasnt worth the gas to get there one decent deal for me.Spider line braid 50% off
306314,jace,2009-02-14 14:39:00,472,"  ""Original"" braid or the Stealth fusion stuff?   I was planning on checking out CTC today after i hit the computer store.   I'm guessing you went to the waterloo location."
306330,Bernie66,2009-02-14 15:11:00,123,"Its typical C.T. Bull.  There is absolutely nothing decent on sale in the fishing department.  A couple of crap combos that I wouldn""t even give to my 7 year old to use.  I did end up buying a good frying pan for $12, 70% off. LOL."
306335,johnnyb,2009-02-14 15:22:00,3413,"I think it's still too early for the real blowouts...and with the long winter, they may not have much left to blowout anyway...seems like lots more people trying out icefishing with the extended cold temps...."
306365,Cookslav,2009-02-14 17:50:00,1457," Aint that the truth... Could't find a four man sub Zero ice hut all season in Kitchener/Waterloo...saw 2 of the smaller versions back in December Could't find an sub zero 8"" auger all season saw 3 of the 6"" But still to this date, not one store carries these items in stock in waterloo region yet they are on the website, and even been on sale in their flyers.   I generaly love Canadian Tire but this seasons been a bugger..."

306391,waterwolf,2009-02-14 20:19:00,556," i was disappointed with the selected sale items as well,, total crap !!     i did pick up a couple rolls of stren superbraid .  couldn't pass up the $12 frying pan either."
306392,Bernie,2009-02-14 20:20:00,3190,Advertising works doesn't it. Got you guys in the store and  I bet not many left empty handed.
306395,rob v,2009-02-14 20:34:00,535,Bernie you hit the nail on the head.   I too went to see what kind of deals there were and other than some crap that shouldn't be on the shelves in the first place it was a waste of time.   I did see a nice 4 pack of 10' tie downs with ratchets for $12 that I couldn't be without - guess I left a bit of money there. Mission accomplished
306399,SBCregal,2009-02-14 20:45:00,688,"i picked up the plano softsided tackle bag with 4 of the clear plastic snap-close containers...it was on sale for 12.49, 50% off and they had lots of them (burlington location, guelph line) i think im going back tomorrow for another one or two of them! buddy of mine told me there was a bin of spinner baits for 3 or 4 bucks, but i couldnt find them *shrug*"
306771,xeon,2009-02-15 20:25:00,350,"  I picked up a plano tackle bag too, but the spinners at the ctc near me were garbage. They were also trying to get rid of 1000yrd spools of triline in 6lb and 12lb... no 8lb though, because no one uses 8"
306792,Cudz,2009-02-15 22:39:00,2652,"Beside that tackle bag, that sale = no good."
306798,richyb,2009-02-15 22:52:00,774,only thing in the orillia store was spiderline 50% off .
306822,Bernie66,2009-02-15 23:41:00,123,"C.T. sold that Plano softsided tackle bag for 10 bucks last year. I think it was the Canada day sale??? You really have to be carefull, the same stuff gets put on sale over and over again, some times at a different price.  Another example is that cordless screw driver they have on sale from time to time.  I've seen it range from a low of $9.99 to 14.99, exact same product code."
307965,foolinfish,2009-02-18 22:43:00,5,WALMART is good they have ongoing sales different things different weeks.Try your nearest DOLLAR STORE in the spring .I bought 10 rattle shads 1.00 each .They run just the same as the rapala model but you may want to change out the hooks .I cast them into structure without any concerns of losing one to snags.And the fish don't care great for smallies hanging in submerged trees.  foolinfish
307970,tinbanger,2009-02-18 22:59:00,1028,"Never have tried to get a 'sale' item , just lazy I guess , but have picked up some deals when I see those red/orange tags Kinda like how I pick my wine , $1 off or Air Miles LOL The $20 quantum rods i picked up a couple weeks back made me happy  I am looking for a reel for that ST Croix Lite rod I won at Tylers event , maybe go for a drive tomorrow!  TB"
307985,Cudz,2009-02-18 23:27:00,2652,I too got a couple of those $20 rods and I see that they are back up to $70 again
