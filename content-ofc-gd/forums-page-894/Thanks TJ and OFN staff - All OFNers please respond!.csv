308680,Fish Farmer,2009-02-20 15:18:00,2234,Thanks guys  I always check in for fish info when I'm home Oh and Thanks Johnnybass for the post. Nice gesture.
308690,joonmoon,2009-02-20 15:41:00,528,"Standing ""O""....Solid. Best board on the web."
308698,walleyejigger,2009-02-20 15:56:00,876,"great job folks, hopefully someday i can buy you a brew,  thanks"
308363,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-19 22:44:00,2585,yes thank you so much.  I often find myslef working 12 -14 hour days and it sure is nice to take a few minute break once in a while to come check out what everyone on OFC is up to.  thanks for creating a place where I can share my passion for fishing with others!  Cheers!
308365,Rich Clemens,2009-02-19 22:46:00,3131,If it weren't for OFC ...  I would not have much use for this computer.  
308367,Big Cliff,2009-02-19 22:53:00,6899,"I hear ya Beans, I tried the Driftwood skin, too hard on these old eyes. I'd rather double click than go any blinder than I already am.  As for this board; well TJ and the mods have done and do a wonderful job but it is a team effort! Without all the fantastic members who take the time to put together such wonderful posts, without all the people who give so much of themselves to help others there wouldn't be an OFC Community.  Kudos to one and all!"
308380,grt1,2009-02-19 23:22:00,638,"what a shock, just got home and checked the site and found the changes, really nicely done  I think this is the best fishing site I've found , no wonder I check it 10 times a day  By the way, I love the anthem  Keep  up the GREAT WORK"

308385,misfish,2009-02-19 23:33:00,29133, That pretty much sums it up right there.

308414,Garry2Rs,2009-02-20 00:36:00,1425,"If it wasn't for OFC I would have descended into a life of Sex, Drugs and Rock N' Roll! Thanks TJ."
308423,nancur373,2009-02-20 00:49:00,1211,"Thanks guys. Not only did I fish more last year, I made some new friends. Keep it up."

308500,HTHM,2009-02-20 02:35:00,4082,"I can see the drugs and rock an roll, but the sex?????Do you have a mirror? That is what I like about this site, the ability to anonymously insult someone who then turns around and gives you some of the best fishing advice I ever received. The GTG are fun, IF I can ever make it there. (darn car) As well, one has a huge pool of potential fishing partners if one chooses. Thanks from me."
308511,superdad,2009-02-20 02:47:00,353,Congrats for sure.....  I thought I had hit the wrong key and the colours changed - d'ohhhhh  Looks good and easy to read  Keep up the fine work - we ALL appreciate it very much
