308261,Fisherpete,2009-02-19 16:34:00,1814,"A few years ago I took my brother out ice fishing on Simcoe. We had been out there for quite a while when I saw him get this disturbed look in his eyes. I should have known what he was up to when he took the white pail and slunk off into the shelter even though it was a beautiful day to fish out in the open. A few moments later, he re-emerged, with shame in his eyes. The white pails, labelled on the side ""Frabill Sit-N-Fish"" have since had an ""h"" added to the second word whenever they come up in conversation. At least he put a layer of snow in it first LOL!"
