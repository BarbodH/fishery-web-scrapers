306970,tjsa,2009-02-16 14:11:00,1578,"Finally got out fishing after no fishing for 6 months. It was an easy trip, drove out on the ice road and just pulled over near a bunch of huts.      All lines in by 9:20 and called it a day at 3:30  Set lines with 6 inch sucker minnow did all the work today. I had one hit a jig. Tried lots of different ones, got the hit on a Chubby Darter but no hookup. My bud landed 2 pike jigging, that was it. He had lots of fish come up off bottom and look at his offerings, then drop away(other than the 2 pike). We each landed 4 walleye. I got one 15"", two 17"", and my one over 18.1:(46 cm) to complete my limit. My bud could only keep 2, one 15"", one 20"", and landed 2 others over the 46 cm mark, but they had to go back since he already had his one over. We also landed 3 pike, one by me, 2 for my bud, and he also had a bite off(probably a pike).  My 24"" fish,  camera was accidentally on the wrong setting, but I didn't know that until I tried to take a closeup pick for the tourney.    After setting my camera to the proper setting, my team 3 entry.    My limit for the day.    We were surprised the set lines outdid the jigs today, its usually the other way around."

306982,Leecher,2009-02-16 14:38:00,7832,"Great report and pics tjsa  That 24"" eye sure looks real nice... congratulations Thanks for sharing Leechman"
306987,tjsa,2009-02-16 14:44:00,1578," Pure luck Terry, the pike came out of that one hole(my first fish of the day) and I thought about moving it 20 min. later, but I was jigging in the other 12 holes I drilled and didn't get around to it. Then got my first walleye out of it, so left that line set. Glad I did, as all my fish came out of that one hole. Sometimes it pays to move, sometimes it works out if you don't."
