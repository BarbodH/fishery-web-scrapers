307524,Sinker,2009-02-17 21:46:00,8692," That would be my guess as well.  I wouldn't have driven over that spot to start with. I'd be driving parallel to that crack, looking for a safer spot to cross. I'd say 99% of vehicles thru the ice are in a crack that could have been crossed in a much safer area. I see guys out there doing 60-80km/h.........what do they do when they come to a bad spot?? Hope for good luck?? I never understood that. Taker slow, and watch where your going. And fer gawd's sakes, don't drive over anything that looks ""different"".  Sinker"
307599,Cudz,2009-02-18 00:06:00,2652,"Very close to that. appenrently (this is according to my friend who witnessed it)  there were 3 big pressure cracks that that joined together at this area and kind of made a pie slice in the ice.  as the driver approached the location and noticed that 2 pressure cracks were present, he slowed down quickly,  The sudden slow down put pressure on the front of this 'plate of ice' which caused it to move forward and down below the ice.  The jeep is sitting on a 14' slice of ice that has sunk under the ice.  there is now open water around the jeep from the slice that has gone forward and down. Kind of hard to explain but if they could get that slab of ice that the jeep is sitting on to move back a few feet it might float up to level.  Not going to happen though because it weighs too much and is probably frozen in place. We will have to see what Bassassin says.  i think he is going to get it out today."
307646,Jigger,2009-02-18 01:44:00,1237,"So, what if you just brought your brand new vehicle down for a days ice fishing and its been decided that you're going to walk out to the fishing grounds. Once you get there though, your buddy says ""AWWW cmon man! Lookit all those vans and fullsize trucks out there. Can't be bad if THEY""RE on it!!!"" You go out and your Jeep goes in the drink. Do you a) hang your head in shame   make sure your friend is never seen again  c) Stay friends with said buddy, but only if he pays the 30K  and d) Split the bill??? You can pick more than one..."
307752,outllaw,2009-02-18 11:10:00,1232,i cannot see why a sikorsky helo is not brought in. air lifting is actually cheeper then a 25 thousand dollar bill.
307904,Fishnwire,2009-02-18 19:49:00,983," The real reason the rules surrounding sale of fuel are so strict is because the big oil and gas companies want it that way.  They don't want anybody to be able to sell gas, then they might have to compete on price.  They want owning/operation of fuel depots to be out of the reach of anyone other than established giants.  They make billions, so they'll always be able to afford to play the game...average joes like your friend the marina owner on the other hand can't keep up and are squeezed out.  That's capitalism in the 21st century for you."
307929,ohhenrygsr,2009-02-18 21:15:00,947,can someone send me the GPS points those Jeep Compass make great structure for smallies look at all the room 
307933,snoryder,2009-02-18 21:23:00,4," You might get lost, its a cherokee not a compass.  Anyone updates?  Is he still on the ice?  And I don't think he is near leakage yet, if he goes in then I can see him getting an enviro bill"
307945,ohhenrygsr,2009-02-18 21:43:00,947,oh man even better  look at all that room 
307989,walleyejigger,2009-02-18 23:32:00,876,my ford could yank that sucker out in a jiffy
308030,love2fishhave2work,2009-02-19 00:48:00,212," I would suggest reading your exclusion clauses.  While stupidity is covered, driving on a frozen lake is not."
307224,Cudz,2009-02-17 01:15:00,2652,I have a few more pics and some bigger ones as well but these were taken 2 minutes after it went through.  Apparently it is still there and they are unable to get it out.  It is not sitting on the bottom but on another sheet of ice.  They are worried it is going to sink.  Everyday it is out there he is being fined.  Apparently the whole salvage is going to cost (with fines) in the neighbourhood of $30K.  Seems a bit steep but that is what I was told.  Be careful out there.  
307228,JeffBornFishin,2009-02-17 01:20:00,260,A hard lesson for sure.  I am a firm (pardon the pun  ) believer that if you don't know what you are doing out there you have no business operating a vehicle on the ice.
307232,12footspringbok,2009-02-17 01:27:00,459,"Thats crazy for sure....Seeing as i had my ram 1500 Quad cab out there sunday and today. Mind you i only drove where plent of other trucks, vans, and cars had already been out and i didn't  cross any pressure cracks out there! Ice was creaking like crazy out there today though under my truck too kinda made me nervous...."
307233,e-z-out,2009-02-17 01:30:00,1052,30K thats crazy and it's still there. I feel for the guy i truly do.
307236,cram,2009-02-17 01:32:00,1733,"that's a lot of money.  Don't they just need another truck (on good ice) to pull it out?   I could understand if lifting from the bottom, but that looks a lot easier than 30k...."
307237,irishfield,2009-02-17 01:33:00,26272,I don't understand it still being there. A small tow truck and an ice anchor and it would have been out.. before it froze in. Even an A frame to get some angle advantage and a 2 ton winch.
307242,BassAsin,2009-02-17 01:40:00,806,i have to go down to simcoe tomorrow and pull a truck out!  maybe 2!
307246,Cudz,2009-02-17 01:48:00,2652,apparently ice around it was too unstable?  I believe the issue is that it is sitting on the sheet of ice that has sunk. IT is much deeper in that spot than it looks but it is sitting on a half-sunk sheet of ice.  They were contemplating putting a steel beam through the windowso that if it slips off the ice it won't sink. Not too sure exactly what is going on.
307253,nancur373,2009-02-17 02:13:00,1211,So tell us how YOU do it. Do you drill holes every ten feet? Give me a break. Crap happens.   Ccurt
307258,Mattones,2009-02-17 02:25:00,587,Wont ever catch me being in a car on ice. ever.  I'll walk that 1-2kms.
307266,scuro2,2009-02-17 02:50:00,904,Looks like a nice jeep. At least they got out.
307269,brifishrgy,2009-02-17 03:01:00,559,"What kind of fine do they get for parking ""in "" the ice ???"
307276,Joey,2009-02-17 03:12:00,9122,How far out from shore are they?  Joey
307279,Cudz,2009-02-17 03:23:00,2652,Environmental damage fine.
307283,irishfield,2009-02-17 03:33:00,26272,Yet marinas spill gallons of gas in the water every day filling boats. That things not deep enough for either the fuel tank or engine oil to be discharged by (heavier specific gravity) water. Sunk boats at docks cause more damage than that thing is right now.
307288,Cudz,2009-02-17 03:39:00,2652,About 200m off shore over 40 ft of water.
307301,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-17 03:53:00,2585,"i wonder if you called caa if they would help, may be alot cheaper then the 30k some are saying it will cost to get it out  cheers!"
307325,love2fishhave2work,2009-02-17 04:56:00,212,"While I enjoy fishing as much as most on this board, it still baffles the mind that people drive $40,000 vehicles on any ice regardless of thickness and risk $30,000 salvage fees in the hopes of catching a few perch or whitefish.  Every year these pictures are posted but yet somehow, the lure of the mighty perch is greater for some than common sense."
307333,BassAsin,2009-02-17 05:22:00,806,Insurance!
307346,Big Cliff,2009-02-17 10:59:00,6899,"The cost of clean up can be really high! Our neighbour had a fuel oil leak: The bill to date for the clean up (because he has waterfront property) is in excess of $1.2 Million and still climbing, it has been 2 years and the clean up is still going on. It was only a 250 gal tank and leaked into the ground about 150' away from the water!  The marina a couple of doors down was going to put in a new gas tank: Cost $50 K for a containment system in case there was ever a leak + all new tanks and equipment + only people that could serve fuel had to take a course @$1000.00 ea. They couldn't afford to put it in.  The rules and laws are getting stricter all the time and the fines? I don't know what they are now but I'll bet they are high!"
307349,Roy,2009-02-17 11:20:00,13728,"The amount of the fine is determined by and inversely proportional to the number of people you have in the ""lobby"", Cliff."
307449,POLLIWOGG,2009-02-17 18:03:00,835,Guys laugh at me when I tell them they shouldn't be dumping 90 lb of salt on the boat ramp.  The fine is two hundred thousand dollars.
307450,BillM,2009-02-17 18:04:00,17367,A 200k fine for what? lol
307453,web-fisherman,2009-02-17 18:14:00,54,OK - I'm assuming the picture was taken the day of the accident. Just looking at the ice in the picture I could tell you it was not going to be safe (or iffy) Do you agree?  Look at the brite side  1. No one got hurt! 2. Think of the structure this will make when it finally sinks! We should tell him to roll down all of the window and throw some saplings in there.
307459,irishfield,2009-02-17 18:39:00,26272, NO.. we were out there in a van Saturday....ice was perfectly safe (as ice can be). Some pressure cracks were getting questionable when we came back in and some refreeze spots looked iffy so you just don't drive on them. Looks like he drove into a pressure crack area where the ice got pushed down (what he's sitting on) and it refroze above it.. but not solid. He went thru the refreeze and is sitting on the original ice (that is most likely over 14 inches thick.)
