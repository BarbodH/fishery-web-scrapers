I'm not lookng for deep sea fishing, just something from shore or beach.  First of all has anyone fished in Puerto Plata?  Can anyone recommend what I should bring along with the rod or what type of line to use? hooks? bait? etc. Any help would be much appreciated. Peace "

307934,legacey,2009-02-18 21:23:00,127,"I responded to your post, CodeRed...just saw this one now re: PP.  I was there a couple of weeks ago and stayed at the Allegro. I picked up the same rod as you've got and brought along a few eerie deries and such but obvioulsy not the right stuff. Knowing what I do now, I'd bring along a few rapala's and longer crank baits.  I found out when I was there, the best place to fish is just to the left of the Gran Ventana resort...if you're on the beach and facing the ocean that is....just down from there a little ways, you'll see an old pier / rock pile with fence covering it...it's a point and you'll have better luck there. It's a great view too with the mountain behind you and the resort that is closest is under renovations so you have open space to enjoy.  I wasn't up early enough but I was told by a fellow Canadian I saw fishing, that's the best time to fish and early evening unitl around 10:00. A local told me they've caught cuda upwards of 50+ lbs in front of the GV in the evening. The Canadian was using a worm harness with a bobber and bacon. He said the bacon worked better than ham.   He caught cuda, small colour fish and even an octopus.  The best part too....there's what they call the ""orange huts"" about another 10-15 minute walk from there. They sell all kinds of things but the best of all, cold, big beers.  This is a long shot but you'll get hasseled by a lot of vendors. One in particular that knew a lot about fishing from shore there was #63. He spoke english well and made really cool bracelets out of phone cable from England and the upper part of fishing swivels for $5 US. We bought him out of them but he said he was making more.  Where are you staying in PP? I'd happily try to guide you where to go from what I learned. The rum kept me from getting up in the morning and fishing later....damn stuff is too good and I didn't want to leave the bar for long.  Sorry about the grammar....typing fast to get out of the office but I do have other suggestions and just realized...this is getting long.  Cheers,  Paul"
