First thing on the ice he goes through a crack that opened up. Didn't notice the space til too late. Just like his mom   Only went down as far as his waste. I'm sure ""the boys"" will be playing hide and seek for a little while. Despite the initial mishap he stuck it out. Very little water got through the wet pants. As usual, it was another ""you should have been here yesterday kinda day. Very slow bite. Had to work for em. More dinks than anything, But when the odd big boy came around    The final tally for a later supper.   A nice morning   ( probably our last nice one for the next few days)"

307699,hammercarp,2009-02-18 03:55:00,964,A nice little feed there. And nope you should not have been there yesterday. I was and the guys I met got zilch. I fished for carp for a few hrs. and blanked. But it was a beautiful afternoon. I am assuming it is the same place we met last weekend.
