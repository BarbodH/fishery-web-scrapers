307657,misfish,2009-02-18 02:03:00,29133, I was lookingat them today. I hear June will be the time to buy.
307669,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-18 02:35:00,10439,  Don't forget their Muscle Car.....................The AMX.  
307674,BUSTER,2009-02-18 02:43:00,1336,i'd trade my silverado for a superdirty anyday!
307680,Bernie,2009-02-18 03:04:00,3190," Hey Drifter, I beat you to that one. On the first page. There was one of those around here when I was a kid. It was a pretty quick car."
307687,bigugli,2009-02-18 03:17:00,6138,Maybeeee?      Or a couple of Asian manufacturers.  Maybe the company in India with the $2000 car
307692,Markystang,2009-02-18 03:28:00,131,Yah but which one...?
307706,holdfast,2009-02-18 04:18:00,1813," Ripping guys like me.  Paid 800 dollars today to replace a fuel pump on my Ranger.  When I asked them where I could buy their Dope, they told me it wasn't funny because the pump cost 600 dollars and they had to order it from the States.  You wonder why I hate the fact that my Tax money is going to these incompetent clownies.  Yup and the Ranger only has 115 thousand Kms."
307711,Bernie,2009-02-18 04:36:00,3190,Just a couple years ago it was costing some Chev truck owners $1200 to R&R a fuel pump. They have dropped since then but only since the aftermarket started to compete. Try not to run fuel tanks low on fuel if you can help it as the fuel helps to cool them. Also change fuel filters regularly as plugged and partially plugged filters overwork the pumps.
307713,irishfield,2009-02-18 04:40:00,26272," Yah.. try telling that to your kids Bernie!    The pump in my '98 GMC has been screaming loud for a couple years.  As for ""D Day""... I thought your calendar was a way off there for a bit Brian!"
307720,cram,2009-02-18 05:02:00,1733,Didn't Canada or Ontario pony up more than $4B?   I'd hope that our plants aren't closing....
307730,Stoty,2009-02-18 05:37:00,2910," EXACTLY why they are going teats up! Can't produce that many cars every night....and expect them all to sell. It's eventually going to catch up to ya! Cars arent like toilet paper...you dont need a new one after every ""use"".  Just like someone said.... they made the bed......"
307759,OhioFisherman,2009-02-18 12:00:00,6623,"My cousin Bob had an AMX back in the day quick little ride, but Chevy`s  rule! The also made the Marlin! For the fish folks that weren`t into Barracudas.  Don`t like to see bail outs, but I sure don`t want to see a depression. It is not just the American auto companies that are hurting, it is a world wide auto problem. The sales are down drastically for all of the auto companies foreign and domestic.  Foreign governments are bailing out their auto companies, do we just let ours close up and let them control the auto markets when things pick up again?  Goodyear has annouced massive restructuring also because tire sales have dropped. So the trickle down effect of the auto industry problems continues.  States here are going broke, they can`t give their state income tax refunds due to lack of cash, lol I wonder if that means I don`t have to pay mine?"
307768,holdfast,2009-02-18 12:50:00,1813,"Chrysler's Big restructuring plan.  Discontinue three vehicle models.  WHAT A JOKE.  CAWs big call, MAYBE WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE CONCESSIONS.  do these idiots have any Brains?"
307775,foolinfish,2009-02-18 13:17:00,5,All the equipment is there ready to use make our own damn cars .Every other country in the world does .
307798,capt bruce,2009-02-18 14:29:00,820,"Some good points made here but could GCD or someone else explain WHAT PART OF A RAT IS IT""S ""PATOOTIE"" and why would someone "" GIVE ONE"""
308096,2 tone z71,2009-02-19 03:04:00,1311,"wheres GM going ,NOWHERE, people in power will not let it happen,see Obamas new Caddy,see the fleet of Yukons Suburbans Tahoes surrounding it,see the Humvees every time theres a war shot on the news"
307566,misfish,2009-02-17 23:22:00,29133,"I cant make heads or tails of it. They get it,the funds,but no real plan. From what I can read from it,the American plants now hold the cards. The Candian based plants get 10 or 15 % of the payout from the American buy out.  Im very confussed .  Will the GM and Crysler plants be history in Canada?  Ford seems to be holding thier own.  Im thinking this is a move to bust the union. Again, dont make this a union bash.Im way past this now. You have made yer beds and now you/we ALL have to work it out.  Were just waiting to get the word to start stamping out the parts for the 2010 models as we have 20 new dies to get vamped up.   So,what do you all think?  May you all work to provide."
307571,Greencoachdog,2009-02-17 23:32:00,8163,"Do you remember Hudson, Studebaker, Rambler, American Motors...."
307572,misfish,2009-02-17 23:35:00,29133,How old do you think I am?????????  I do remember American Motors. They made the most ugliest cars. I believe one was named the matodor and then there was the Gremlin????????? That was a cool hatch back.
307574,Greencoachdog,2009-02-17 23:37:00,8163,"I should have said, have you ever heard of Hudson, Studebaker, Rambler, American Motors..."
307579,misfish,2009-02-17 23:40:00,29133,
307581,Dondorfish,2009-02-17 23:41:00,1000,I do remember American Motors. They made the most ugliest cars. I believe one was named the matodor and then there was the Gremlin????????? That was a cool hatch back.    How could you not include the goldfish bowl - Pacer?  Don
307583,Grimace,2009-02-17 23:42:00,2020,AMC also made the Concord and the Hornet.      Tanks.   They were bullet proof
307587,Bernie,2009-02-17 23:47:00,3190,You could be right GCD. I hope not though.  Amc had a couple of neat cars. They had a hotrod in the late 60's. Was a nice looking car too. An AMX if I recall. And the Eagle was an interesting concept but it was poorly made. All wheel drive made it a good winter car.
307590,misfish,2009-02-17 23:55:00,29133,"Now that I think of it,didnt they make the Javlen? That was a very cool car too.  Bring back AMC. HAHAHA"
307591,misfish,2009-02-17 23:56:00,29133,"PACER VS Gremlin. The same car,but one was so much uglier"
307597,Greencoachdog,2009-02-18 00:05:00,8163," Oh yeah! The AMX was a souped up version of the Javelin!  You can see a Matador that converts into and airplane and a Hornet that jumps a river with a full twist here!    As some of you may know, AMC was a pretty good sized car company at one time... they were the ones that bought Rambler when they went out.  ... but they didn't last forever."
307600,misfish,2009-02-18 00:07:00,29133,Guess Im older then I think.LOL  So now back to your thoughts on the buy out. Is it good or bad???????????????
307601,Cudz,2009-02-18 00:11:00,2652,AMC had some good cars SC/Rambler little car with a big engine Rebel Javelin Amx  and not mention Jeeps Cherokee and wagoneers were some of the pioneers in the SUV field
307602,Bernie,2009-02-18 00:14:00,3190,Bad Brian. Our country was built on hard working efficent companys. Swim or sink. Why support a company that isn't making the grade? Like Glen said earlier. Where are theose companys from the past? No one bailed them out. Our countrys remained viable and strong afterwards. Supporting failure only leads to more failure.
307603,Greencoachdog,2009-02-18 00:14:00,8163," I don't really give a rat's patootie!... whatever happens, will happen... and there's nothing we can do about it!!"
307609,misfish,2009-02-18 00:20:00,29133," New vocab for you.Almost sounded Canadian.HAHAHAHAHA I agree,what ever happens,happens ,and we ALL, I HOPE,will get throught it."
307615,ketchenany,2009-02-18 00:36:00,3229,  We have one parked on our farm! Been there for more than 20 years! Probably
307616,Greencoachdog,2009-02-18 00:46:00,8163,"It's kinda like this...  Jeep bought Willys... then Chrysler bought Jeep... the Mercedes bought Chrysler...  It's an evolutionary thing, the strongest will survive!!!"
307627,ccmtcanada,2009-02-18 01:13:00,7971,AMC...you mean the movie company?  How old are you guys???
307628,misfish,2009-02-18 01:13:00,29133,"So in other words,FORD,is the winner here?????????"
307630,Bernie,2009-02-18 01:16:00,3190, Well ummmmm...I do a lot of research?????
307634,jediangler,2009-02-18 01:24:00,1923,I think Ford is on the right track by not begging for cash. It makes them look more viable to potential new car buyers. Who wants a car from a company that may pull out of Canada or even be bankrupt in under 6 months?
307641,bucktail,2009-02-18 01:29:00,1857,Jedi  I think you have a good point and that will be in the minds of people when they buy. My question is what are they going to do with all that unsold stock? I heard they have rented out Canada's Wonderland parking lot to store unsold cars? Not good for anyone.
307642,misfish,2009-02-18 01:31:00,29133," Thats a very good point jed.  Did I mention ,when we bought our new Focus,the Ford dealership had made 16 sales by 2 pm?????????  Im not going to do the PRO Ford thing,but they seem to do it right,for some reason.  Not sure,was there a guy named GMC??????????"
307645,Bernie,2009-02-18 01:43:00,3190,If they are looking for a place to park one of those F250 4x4's there is a real nice parking spot in my driveway!
