308056,ccmtcanada,2009-02-19 01:28:00,7971,I had a great time...cheaper than the movies!
308063,aniceguy,2009-02-19 01:52:00,1094,Charles I do have a few secret crib locations  for sale too
308240,hirk,2009-02-19 15:55:00,571,"Well Charles I will likely run into you fishing the Quinte series or Caraveth's Stoney etc. so I'll talk to ya then and will do better than seeing it,you can jump in for a boot and I'd like to have a run in yours.I agree on the quality thing,it was my #1 on criteria but your good with the Champ in that dept.,they made my short list of 3 boats.Ernie those boats are like hot women,it's ok to look but ""love the one your with"",you got it good with the Ranger you have."
308305,ld17,2009-02-19 19:28:00,319,"I went to the show and didn't really enjoy it.  I guess when you go to all the show's like Bass pro, boat show, sportsmans show, they start to get boring.  Same old same old.  Unfortunatly I didn't have time to listen to the pro seminars.  That I do enjoy and feel for that alone it's worth the money.  For the boats, what boats there were harldly any.  I know, I went to the boat show and it did not compare.  Let's face it times have changed and the show's of yester year are gone.  When I buy tackle I just support the local guy now.  I live in hamilton and why buy from someone that has a store 2hrs away from me when I have 2 tackle shop's 10mins away.  When something goes wrong with you rod or reel you gonna drive 2hrs away to get your 80 dollar rod fixed that you saved 10 bucks at a show. It will cost you 1/2 tank of gas.  No I don't think so.  I think if you go for some fun and with some freinds that like fishing it's worth it, if not save your money.  My 2 cents"

307019,John,2009-02-16 17:32:00,2956," Yeah, what he said! I didn't go with the idea of getting deals. If ya want a deal on a boat go to the dealer and deal, likewise on tackle. The seminars were great and had to be worth the price of admission. Sorry I missed Pete's. Getting to meet up with OFNrs, some whom we knew and some that we didn't, was an opportunity that only comes around once or twice a year, if that.  Oh yeah, I went to the Sabres game last night and the pop and the bottled water was $3.50 US. The price of beer was damn ugly!"
307036,TroutSlayer,2009-02-16 18:33:00,64,"All valid points people.   I stopped going to trade shows years ago when ticket and parking costs increased to a certain point.   I will never line up and pay money to have the chance to spend money on anything.  If I needed to look at boats to make a decision, I would let the dealers know I was interested and expect free admittance as well as a cab ride to and from the event looked after by whoever wanted my business.  I see a lot of free tickets being thrown around now, so I guess some dealers are feeling the pinch.   They need to stop charging all together and make it easy for people to spend money."
307038,JohnF,2009-02-16 18:38:00,3494," On that note, I've been involved as an exhibitor in other trade shows (NF) over the years and it's a big decision to decide what the best trade-off of your money and time vs attendance and exposure really is. As more shows of any type start up targetting the same audience it gets even more difficult to choose, and sometimes the dilution of the audience reduces the value of all the shows.  In my mind a really good trade show like a fishing show is one that offers something for the widest range of audience, but that something has to be quality something. This show I thought had excellent presenters working. I thought boats for the everyday fisherperson were decently represented. The taxidermy (or whatever the name is these days) guys were kinda interesting. I liked seeing the folks from the Kawartha tourism industry there. Perhaps I missed them but did any other tourism area attend? The resort and cottage operators were nice to see, to the limited extent they were represented. I'm relatively new to this fishing thang and I'll probably spend some money at a few resorts in the next few years, if I can find places I want to visit. It would have been nice to have seen the MNR represented in some way (if they were I missed 'em). I know they have people working at spreading the gospel of conservation and wildlife management and it would have been a great opportunity for them to present their case in person and get some live feedback. Unfortunately the retail sector wasn't all that well represented. I don't mean the retail stores themselves. There were a few although they were so full of displayed merchandise and bargain hunters I avoided them. What I would have liked to see were more manufacturers presenting their latest wares on behalf of the retailers who sold their products. And instead of the TV shows having their own booths, why not put the celebs in the manufacturers booths to tout the products they endorse? Loomis had a nice booth and a couple of lure makers were there but where were the big boys with the rods and reels and lines, probably the biggest items for us everyday fisherpersons?  I suspect the problem for those manufacturers and resort operators who were missing is that there are too many shows of this kind and only so much time and money to go around. The new department store fishing retailers don't need to attend these shows when they put on their own shows in their huge facilities already, and that also provides the manufacturers with a better outlet for their new product introductions & demonstrations as well. The internet is their main advertising vehicle these days.  All that being said this show was fine as far as I was concerned. I didn't go there to eat so the food prices meant nothing to me. I had to drive almost 100 miles home so I wasn't going to be drinking a bunch. I got to see a variety of boats up close just in case my good wife ever weakens. And it was a pleasure to meet the other OFNers who attended. I guess I didn't work hard enuf at it though as it seems there were some I missed but I'll catch them next time around.  JF"
307051,hirk,2009-02-16 18:59:00,571,"I thought the show was good,being the second yr. for it Andy has done a great job.What has to be realized is that this is a great venue for Manufacturers/Reps. to showcase products,I noticed several LARGE Co.'s in the industry didn't have a booth and think they missed a great chance to profile and ultimately sell product through retailers.I believe the retailers were limited in number due to space cost and costs accociated with doing a show.I have a shop 45 minutes from the show but choose not to have a booth,the math just doesn't add up.I guess it comes down to your expectations and the direction the show takes in the future,but for $12 a great way to spend a day in my opinion."
307052,Garry2Rs,2009-02-16 19:01:00,1425,"I have heard it said that ""The first sign of Spring in Ontario is the Leaf's are falling.""  HAHAHA! For 40 years, in my world, that first sign was the Sportsmen Show. In more recent times we have had the Spring Fishing Show and now this new show in February. It's true, I suppose that the shows have become smaller, or less fishing oriented. Others have already pointed out that the Inter-net has given us access to the latest baits as fast as they appear on the market.  Years ago your first look at new gear came at these shows.  Good or bad, most of us will keep going, because we need the reassurance that Winter will end and that we will soon see another open-water season."
307065,bigugli,2009-02-16 19:49:00,6138,"Just got back from the show. I think Andy and Vita have done a good job on their second show   I caught 2 seminars. Got to meet Dave Mercer ( I'm a little rounder than he is  ). Got to spend some time talking with Mike Miller one to one. Picked up a supply of my fave spinnerbaits, Black Fly. I spoke with a couple of outfitters. I do not book based on what I saw on a web page. I want to talk to people from a lodge. You get a really good feel on what a place is like by finding out what the people are like."
307271,tdotfisherman,2009-02-17 03:02:00,317,"This is only my second year at this show... and I know this version has only been going on for two years, but I enjoyed myself quite a bit.. It's the middle of February.. it's freezing cold outside.. there's only frozen, dismal, Lake Ontario Pike fishing going on right now.. and going to this show is quite a nice little escape.. I got to price some new boats that I have been looking at, along with buy some tackle to top up my tackle box for 2009.. For $12 (or free admission in my case - thx again TJ) it's well worth it on a cold Ontario Winter day.. as for the deals, yeah.. they were weak, but spending a day around boating and fishing stuff is too good to pass up for me.. Plus c'mon.. Dave Mercer talking about his own crap for 10 minutes.. how can a guy go wrong?"
307285,duber,2009-02-17 03:37:00,220,"I really like the show.We got there at 8;00am for the walleye master angler seminar with Gord,Ted and Jim.It was very good.We got to take in Jim Sarics muskie show and listened to Italo,Ron and Leo,Babe and Dave.Were else can you see a line up like this for 12 bucks.The master angler seminars are worth twice that alone.We left at 4:30 so that was 8.5 hrs of thinking about nothing but our favorite pass time for 12 bucks.  As far as the deals go I saved some cash ( $150.00 ) on a new LMS-520 with great lakes chip and ram mount from radio world.So I can't complain about that either.  All in all I had a great time!"
307335,charlesn,2009-02-17 05:33:00,551,"Spoke with several exhibitors at the show.  The absence of several major manufacturers and Lebaron was no coincidence according to them.  The manufacturers were basically told they could not be there if they wanted to keep their products on Lebaron shelves.  That was the reason why Shimano, Pure Fishing, Quantum were absent.  They definitely left a big void in the show.  I heard a few marinas also had to pull out after poor sales at the Boat show.  Kinda a sign of the times and how competitive and cutthroat it is right now.  I don't think you can blame Lebaron for pushing their weight around, after all, why give an advantage to out of town competition coming to one of your hometowns to sell gear?  Each rod, reel, bait or whatever that Tightlines, Fishing World, Natural Sports, etc. sells in Mississauga is probably one less sale for Lebaron, right?  I'd probably try to defend my turf too in their position.  Still, hopefully the vendors sold enough stuff to make it worth their while as it would be discouraging to lose one of the first signs of spring.  Been a while since I actually bought anything at a show, and this show was no different as I did not buy anything but spoke to a lot of enthusiastic fisherpeople and saw 1 heck of an entertaining seminar by a pretty loud big dude.  Dave something."
307337,maybe,2009-02-17 06:32:00,307,"I don't understand that.  On one hand, Lebarons decide to stay closed for half the weekend, driving us to Bass Pro...and on the other they're trying to chase their suppliers out of town?  Considering how utterly useless Lebaron's site is, you'd think they'd be thrilled to have the manufacturers educate potential customers on their behalf."
307340,Stern Rules,2009-02-17 07:38:00,342,"I noticed the show wasn't the same last year. Wasn't quite into it but then again I got a call that day that a good friend died so I just didn't feel like being there. Then Lindner announced that he had no time for autographs after his seminar as he had to leave to catch a flight. That was a BIG disappointment. He's the only reason I went. Waiting to see him for years. One of the big draws for me is when the have the American pros. What happened to Grigsby this year. They were advertising him a few weeks ago I'm sure. Met him anyway 2 years ago. Well got to meet Winkelman and Takasaki this time. Babe had some good advise for sure. Even caught him talking about shooting some hunting shows. And I didn't see the Fish'n Canada guys there. Weren't at the sportsmen's show last year either I don't think. Even if the show isn't quite as good as before, at least it's something to do in February."
307374,charlesn,2009-02-17 13:36:00,551," I agree.  Maybe because of tight times they have to save their show dollars for the Sportsman's show.  They will probably have a big presence there.  I had no idea they stay closed, I woulda thought they would do a no tax sale to compete with the show at the very least.  Strange indeed."
307377,aniceguy,2009-02-17 13:55:00,1094,"the Lebaron business model and thier method of retailing is strange for sure.......but to  not allow a supplier to showcase thier products is even stranger.  Besides, while Im not one of thsoe star stuck sotra guys ( well angela Jolie not included in that ) I did finally get to meet next to Red fisher a true fishing hero  babe winkleman, it was a great 15 minute talk in the isle !!!!"
307423,ricoboxing,2009-02-17 16:25:00,398,"i thought it was a good way to spend a saturday afternoon with the wife and kids. The only thing i bought were 2 picture frames for 5 bucks. i won the tix, don't think i would pay $12 X 2 to go though."
307544,Garry2Rs,2009-02-17 22:23:00,1425,"I doubt that Le-Baron could dictate to the big multi nationals. What's Le-Baron going to do when they decide not to stock Shimano, or Pure fishing, who own Abu Garcia, All Star Rods, Berkley, Mitchell, Fenwick, Penn, Pflueger, Shakespeare, Spiderwire, Stren, Trilene, and Coleman??? Without them Le-Baron might as well close their fishing department. The big names have all signed up for the Sportsmen Show in a few weeks.  I suspect that is why they weren't at this show."
307550,charlesn,2009-02-17 22:36:00,551,"That's what I'd think too...  but...  This wasn't like one person I spoke to that said it, was several from several booths.  Where there is smoke there is fire usually.  But on the manufacturers and the organizer of the show probably know for sure.  My response was the same as yours, how can one company dictate to all those manu's, sounds a little strange indeed.  Maybe just your average run of the mill fishing show gossip."
307552,Radnine,2009-02-17 22:45:00,1538,"I went to the show on Monday. I thought it was quite good really. I had a coupon out of the paper for $2.00 off admission (thanks Fishing World) and the free parking is a God send. As far as deals go, I thought that there were some to be had (YUM Dingers for $3.33/bag, selected Rapalas $6.00 each), and my nephew bought two reels that were at one vendor for $160, for $120 cash (each) taxes in! There were also vendors there that were out to lunch on their prices. I enjoyed talking to the few factory reps that were there, and I met Lew and his wife (Lew was actually too busy haggling for his new boat at the time, but his wife is charming). All in all a good couple of hours in February. Jim"
307559,muskeybugged,2009-02-17 22:55:00,282,"Winkleman broke my hand when we shuck,  Bear paws on the boy.  The star studded line up was fantastic and worth the $12.  A different star at every turn it seemed.  Thanks to those who showed face, I was like a 12 year old girl at a BSB concert!"
307570,Roy,2009-02-17 23:32:00,13728,WOW! I can't believe the rumour mill in here.
307578,misfish,2009-02-17 23:39:00,29133," I didnt say a word.  I heard good and bad at work. It,s the same thing every year. You get, what you get out of it. Oh, that might of been a bad post."
307835,jedimaster,2009-02-18 16:14:00,3472,"I got a good deal on a new musky rod.. not much though in the way of deals, a few of the boat dealers said they sold more in 3 days at the fishing show than a week at the boat show."
307840,hirk,2009-02-18 16:32:00,571,"Charles I'd say about zero chance of LeBaron's dictating to Pure Fishing how/when/where they choose to do their marketing,in real terms LeBaron's would be a fly on their *** lol.I have heard Rapala had another commitment therefore couldn't attend,no idea about Shimano."
307846,charlesn,2009-02-18 17:01:00,551,"lol, thanks hirk, good to know no one store has that much pull.  You being in the business would definitely know.  Guess the cabin fever has me more gullible than usual.  Can't wait to head out your way some time and watch that Ally fly.  There was a real pretty Ally at the show and I looked her over up down and around and really really like the deeper cockpit and the second row of seating.  You certainly can't compare the construction with the mass-produced bass boats out there.  Would also make it better for taking my kids out.  Being able to run 95 once in a while would just be a bonus."
307877,ecmilley,2009-02-18 18:21:00,2163,"for the small amount of money i had to spend, I had a great time listning to the speakers and a better time talking with everyone (taro, dave chong, mark kulik, pete mania, dave mercer) and sharing some laughs, also meeting fellow OFC'ers tangled lines tj  cliff and carol ect (ok can't remember the rest). there were some deals to be had but since my house already looks like bass pro shops there wasn't much use in buying more stuff (which is why I took my tiburon to the show 2 fat guys and 4 t-shirts she was full) and after running my hands over the alliston and the ranger comanche at the show i was in love."
307879,rob v,2009-02-18 18:40:00,535,I agree with some of the previous coments.  For the money involved just listening to the guest speakers and having an opportunity to talk to/meet some of these guys was worth it.   I hope the show continues/grows.
306874,scuro2,2009-02-16 02:00:00,904,"This has got to be the smallest fishing show that I can remember. Two things that stand out in my mind this year was the absence of any major fishing lodge (out of province fishing camps and the absence of Kesagami Wilderness Lodge) and fewer bigger fishing stores selling their wares. There seemed to be a fair bit of stuff not related to fishing, although I did by a good heating pad for my neck. My wife and I still did enjoy the show. The exhibitors were all friendly and gracious with there time. This year though the boats were in the middle of the hall and even so it looked like they barely filled the hall. I remember when they had three halls for the same show. It could be the recession or it could be the long term decline addict fisherdudes like us. Perhaps the next generation isn't as gonzo about fishing with too many other competing interests."
306884,Radnine,2009-02-16 02:49:00,1538,"Does this show rate? I mean Bass Pro has a sale to compete with the sportsman show. LeBaron is at the Sportsman show and has the no-tax thing at the show and at it's stores. Is this thing worth going to see or should I save my cabbage for the show in March? Thanks, Jim"
306889,EC1,2009-02-16 03:08:00,930,"The reason probably for the small show is because the ""numbers"" that are interested in fishing is becoming smaller and smaller.  I'm not making this up as I remember reading an article *I believe from the newspapers - The average age of people into fishing is getting higher --> meaning that the people that stay interested into fishing are the same people, just growing older by the year.  AND my buddy that works at a local tackle store is saying how business has been slowing down in the recent years.  BUT, I wanted to ask you guys, if you guys actually found any good deals there, or anything that's interesting and really worth checking out?"
306891,baironhorse,2009-02-16 03:12:00,145,The show has contracted over the years....Many of the boths are selling ecess stock and the deals are not as good they use to be...You got to know what your looking for...As far as Lebaron I have not seen them a the show for a few years ( unless I had to many beers and missed them). The BP spring sale is a bigger venue than the fishing show! Although there tackle is quite pricy and only wroth buying if you can't find it at Lebaron or Crappie Tire! My 2 cents!
306895,Sebastian,2009-02-16 03:20:00,208,"Maybe the cost of $5000 for a booth at a show where everyone wants a deal isnt such a great investment for a small business  I'll stick to Le Barons, JB's, Tightlines, Peters, and Angling Specialties."
306901,SlowPoke,2009-02-16 03:48:00,2984,"It's hard to justify going to the show when everything is available at your fingertips. Shopping, information, reviews etc. are all a google search away. For those that have to put thier hands on an item before they buy, it's a good place to do so. For those that just want to get out and do something fishing related, it's great for them. I think the combination of an aging demographic and internet access limits thier ability to attract new visitors. The 'deals' are the same as they used to be, maybe even better than the old days percentage-wise but those same deals can be had so many other places. -Brian"
306903,bigugli,2009-02-16 03:50:00,6138,"It is still a good event to go to. Even if all I do is learn a few tidbits it is worth it. This is only the second year for this show and it is hard to keep any venue full in hard times, unless you don't mind 10 sock vendors, 5 spice vendors, 4 first aid suppliers, etc.... or the numerous free draws offered by time share companies. I never understood the connection between Raptors cheerleaders and fishing I'l be going tomorrow accompanied by the Mrs."
306915,John Bacon,2009-02-16 04:43:00,3277,This particular show is only in its second year.  The Spring Fishing Show that used to be held in February has been amalgamated with the Toronto Sportsman Show held in March.  Andy Pilotti created a new show that runs at the same time of the year and in the same location as the Spring Fishing Show used to run.  This is not the same show that used to be at the International Centre in Mississaga.  It's not so much that the show is shrinking; its a case of the new show not being as big as the old Spring Fishing Show.
306927,DRIFTER_016,2009-02-16 05:11:00,10439,Even the old spring fishing show was on a down slide for quite a few years. I stopped going when the sausage and sunglass vendors out numbered the fishing tackle vendors. 
306928,cram,2009-02-16 05:42:00,1733,The economy in the US is crap....i bet these guys are hurting and less able to spend 5k to  put up a booth at a show that likely won't generate an immediate return.
306929,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-16 05:52:00,2585,its to bad cause the list of speakers they have is impressive
306930,scuro2,2009-02-16 06:06:00,904,"There were a number of small tackle stores there....less bigger ones. The deals were okay, I don't really drive an hour for deals. I go to find stuff I can't find at my local fishing store and BP, I did end up buying two lures and a float. My wife comes along for the fly-in booths...we talk about my 50th coming up and dream trips. That was always kinda fun in the past. I remember you would always see a number of out of provence booths. None...this time around. Not even Kesagami...which is a bigger operation here in Northern Ontario. Probably about a 1/2 dozen to a dozen lodge booths in total...most booths covering the lower end of the market, say like a Kipawa.  Anyone know of the major US fishing shows? Might be time to take a look."
306937,pikehunter,2009-02-16 11:57:00,1659,"All shows and exhibitions like this are on the decline. The cost is a lot for some companies to bear for the actual return on the investment. Company I used to work for did the Burlington, Oakville, Hamilton, mall shows and other Home Shows all the time, now they do none. The public has become tired of the same old thing year after year after year, another drawback of an aging majority. As some said on other related threads, why drop 30 to a hundred bucks on just getting in and getting there when they can spend that money at a local shop?  As for lodges can you imagine the cost for them to set up a display? Transportation, lodging and meals would be a lot to dish out. Those that went before have probably decided to make their presence at the Sportsmens Show instead, the Granddaddy of them all and most guests of the Fishing and Boat Show will go to the granddaddy anyway. Don't forget the power of the internet, we no longer have to go to a show to find out what is out there, how much they charge and what openings are available, we can sit in a big comfortable chair and surf the offerings and travel the world with a beer or coffee in hand.  For viewing new tackle we now have the big stores like BPS, LeBaron and for most Ontarians a short hop across the border fills that need and we save money when we fill the tank up in U.S gallons as a bonus. The shows are dying, their time has come and gone. However, I just might go to the Sportsmens Show this year if I have the time and something or someone encourages me to do so."
306942,outllaw,2009-02-16 12:13:00,1232,"its a shame promoters have killed the show industry. pricing the smaller venues out and now created a vacuum. the box stores are now realizing this also. putting a slowing economy on top, shows are a bad investment for all."
306948,BUSTER,2009-02-16 12:52:00,1336,"lots of negativity?  well for 12 bucks i thought it was just great, altho i didnt go there to find any deals of the century, i did go to meet some fishing idols and ask any questions i wanted to some pro's, got to sit in on the many seminars that ran all day, for 12 bucks the knowledge you can obtain is priceless?  heck even the parking was free and you people still complain like crazy.  last year the boat show in jan was how much to get in and how much for parking just to look at boats? some things were a deal other were not but hey signed dave mercer shirt 15bucks, fish tv jacket 30 bucks, signed fish tv duffle bag 10 bucks...and was i the only sucker to buy a sham wow!  lol  even the beer was only 6 bucks!  at the AC/DC concert beer was 13 bucks each and shirts were 40 each, parking was 20.    GREAT TIME FOR 12 BUCKS."

306956,BUSTER,2009-02-16 13:26:00,1336,thanks bring bottle of water and a lunch.
306971,limeyangler,2009-02-16 14:12:00,5204,"i understand that getting to a show that is not all that great is a dissappointment....but spare a thought for us in the middle of nowhere where BPS, Lebarons...etc...are ta least 2000kms away....lol. Mind you...the fishing up here makes up for the lack of good tackle stores."
306977,OhioFisherman,2009-02-16 14:31:00,6623,"We have one here in Cleveland also, and like Sebastian mention the cost of space is a factor. My local tackle shop has their own show in their store. They bring in their own speakers geared to what most of his customers are truly interested in. Some of the big name local talent. Mostly geared to bass fishing and Lake Erie, walleye, steelhead.  I also think he is about right with the 5k number, a big number to a smaller local shop, and if you are not going to profit that much from it?  It allows him to save money the week of the show and pass the savings on to his customers. No worrying about keeping the store open and staffing at the show, costs of set up and displays at the show, travel time, although his shop is within a 15 minute drive to the show.  I haven`t been to the local show in years, it was a better plan for me and my buddies to get together and take a drive to NetCraft in Toledo, Bass Pro in Auburn Hills Mi, and Cabela`s in Dundee. Admission fees and parking to the show covered the price of gas.  The show here was the place to go if you were planning a trip, looking for a new place to go because the one here not only had a lot of Canadian camps, but places from most states from here to Florida. The internet has had an effect on that.  Seemed like our show just started to look more and more like a flea market that you had to pay to enter."

307002,nancur373,2009-02-16 16:12:00,1211,I don't think you can put the AC/DC show and the Fishing show in the same category.  Curt
307005,BUSTER,2009-02-16 16:18:00,1336,"just and example, i did use the boat show last january as well for and EXAMPLE of how much they can charge.. point is 12 bucks to get the hell out of the house and talk fishing was worth it."
307006,nancur373,2009-02-16 16:23:00,1211,"Oh, I agree. Just that I was at the concert and I'd rather be there any day than the fishing show."
307007,TJQ,2009-02-16 16:23:00,7806,"I gotta agree...  I didnt do much shopping, for me, personally the show is a great chance to get to see some people, clients , OFNrs and otherwise.   I think the seminars which were always on, were worth the price of admission.   As for not getting any deals, if that's all your looking for Im not sure that that's the main point of the show, I always thought it was to showcase new products and the like.    I aggree its not as big as it used to be, but I still had a great day!  Also...  I dont think the organizers of the show set the price for the beer and water...."
307015,maybe,2009-02-16 16:59:00,307,"Just to make sure the newbies aren't confused, I've gotta hammer home bigugli and JohnBancon's point.  This really is not the show scuro2 seems to think it is.  The old one has been amalgamated into the Toronto Sportsmen's Show, March 18-22 2009 at the Direct Energy Centre.  The currently ongoing Spring Fishing & Boat Show is only the 2nd ever by a new crew who are starting from scratch.  From what I've seen they're really improving their game as they go along.  It takes a while to get anything this big really up and established from square 1.  You'll notice that big players tend to avoid start-ups until they've established themselves, and can demonstrate numbers to justify exhibitor costs.  Smaller businesses will jump in for the the first few rounds because they have to do more outreach to become known.  Nothing weird here.  Oh, and to add to Buster's deals (good going, BTW!), for my $12 admission, I got:  1)  3.5 hours of Gord Pyzer, Big Jim, Mike Desforges, Doug Brownridge & Jarod Dean brain dump - including a long Q&A session - in an intimate group setting (under 25 people)  2)  face time with TJ & Monique, Bly & CCMT, Buster, Fishindevil, Ecmilley, JohnF & his acronym artist friend, Nautifish, and I'm sure I'm forgetting someone here  3)  hugs from TJ - I'm finally a real OFNer! <sniffle>  4)  a Facts of Fishing-branded prepaid Subway card from Dave Mercer (thanks again, Dave!)  So what if Yamamoto senkos weren't 10 packs for a twoonie - the show's about seeing people and learning stuff, and we got that in spades."
