307593,GNODDY,2009-02-17 23:58:00,163,Is anyone else having this issue. It's driving me friggin nuts. Everytime I want to get out of a post I have to double click. This isn't happening to me on any other boards so I am wondering if anyone else is having this issue.  LIKE I SAID ITS DRIVING ME NUTS
307604,Fisherman,2009-02-18 00:15:00,7201,"Yup, this is the only site, although if you use any of the other formats available at the bottom left by the orange box, some of those do work with one click.  Strange thing is that one click works at work, same operating system, figure that out."
307610,douG,2009-02-18 00:25:00,2693,"Gnoddy, you be talking about the back button?  Some of the board patterns you can choose make you click the BACK button twice, a real pita.  It might depend on the various flavours you have of three or four different softwares that could contribute to how the whole SQRMLE and stuff works together.  I dunno.  As Bernie said, look at the very bottom of the page on the LHS, and  you get to pick the way the board looks,  the menu is called 'Skin Selector'.  I am using 'OFC Driftwood' with Firefox 3.0.6 (Click on the very top where it says File / Edit / View and so on, then Help and select About.  You will find the version of the Firefox or Explorer software that you are using right now).  No issues with the Driftwood pattern."
307612,HTHM,2009-02-18 00:31:00,4082,Change to OFC reflect at the bottom of the page and the problem is gone.
307632,TJQ,2009-02-18 01:20:00,7806,It must be a skin thing....  if thats the worst thing that happens all day.....  lifes good.
307637,Jigger,2009-02-18 01:27:00,1237,"When I was reading GNODDYs post, I was thinking"" Yeah that really bugs me too!!""  But then I got to TJs post at the end and thought "" Yeah, it really could be worse"""
307668,BUSTER,2009-02-18 02:31:00,1336,other boards?   i had no idea.
307679,GNODDY,2009-02-18 03:01:00,163,Thanks guys I switch the skin and she's all good.
307686,Cudz,2009-02-18 03:15:00,2652,I use the Christmas skin.  All year Christmas at my house.
307748,Weeds,2009-02-18 08:56:00,782,I get the double click thing even with the Christmas skin until I log in. Then it's single click. Interesting.
307756,Spiel,2009-02-18 11:46:00,9065,"If you really like the ""skin"" you are using there's always the ""GO"" button lower right corner. It takes you back to ""general discussion"" or any other forum on the site using the drop down."
307802,Leecher,2009-02-18 14:34:00,7832,"For those that still have the double click issue and don't want to change their skin, download & install Firefox, it's free and you can forget about double clicking"
307992,walleyejigger,2009-02-18 23:36:00,876,"double click also so it's x-mas for me too,"
308015,Greencoachdog,2009-02-19 00:27:00,8163,"Click on general discussion at the top or bottom of the page, refreshes and takes you back to general discussion so you don't miss a thing!!!"
308038,Dutch,2009-02-19 01:07:00,831,"Double click drives me nutz too.  The problem for me is the ad at the bottom of the page in the Middle.  It says ""the webpage cannot be found"" and then when I click back once, it goes to all white, back a second time gets me back to the topic lists.  Under ""properties"" the ad says:  res://ieframe.dll/http_404.htm#http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/cpa/ads?&oe=iso-8859-1client=ca-pub-2657697424611361&dt=1235005657428&lmt=1235005657&output=html&slotname=3015636094&correlator= 1235005657053&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ofncommunity.com %2Fforums%2Findex.php%3Fshowtopic%3D28851%26st%3D0%26gopid%3D308038%26%23entry308038&region= _google_cpa_region_&ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ofncommunity.com %2Fforums%2Findex.php%3Fact%3Dpost%26do%3Dreply_post%26f%3D2%26t%3D28851&frm=0&ga_ vid=1394780536.1234925512&ga_ sid=1235005344&ga_hid=118730333&ga_fc= true&flash=10.0.12.36&u_h=864&u_w=1152&u_ah=834&u_aw=1152&u_cd=32&u_tz=-300&u_his=71&u_java= true&dtd=62&w=468&h=60&xpc=d59nUZbED2&p=http%3A//www.ofncommunity.com  The Christmas skin was fine for me, so I may use that.  Can the mods set the default skin to one that we don't have to double click on?"
308042,Greencoachdog,2009-02-19 01:11:00,8163,"   This works in all ""skins""!!!"
308047,Dutch,2009-02-19 01:16:00,831," It may, but it's not as convenient as the ""back"" button  I changed the skin for my login, but is there anyway to change the skin when you aren't logged in, the default skin, i.e. the ""OFC Club"" skin?  There's obviously a problem with the Google Ad script on the Club Skin, so can it be fixed?  Does it have to be fixed on my PC?"
308050,Greencoachdog,2009-02-19 01:20:00,8163, ????  It's at the bottom of the last post!... or the top of the page!!!  What could be more convenient???  ... the back button does not refresh... you could be missing a lot by always hitting the back button... stagnating!!!
308053,Dutch,2009-02-19 01:25:00,831,"The option to change the skin is only there after you login, therefore the instructions don't apply to those that aren't logged in - as far as I know.  I use the back button so the pages don't refresh - I work my way down the posts (usually not logged in) and I lose my place in the order if the posts are refreshed, that why I prefer the back button.  That's just my preference...to each their own."
308147,Spiel,2009-02-19 10:56:00,9065,"Okay, so I've changed the default skin to the ""Driftwood"" and when Rick gets back to his ole self we'll get him to look at the script fot the ""OFC Club"" skin.  I'm sure this will upset somebody."
308390,Dutch,2009-02-19 23:40:00,831,"Good change, thanks Spiel.  I'm sure Rick will fix things up.  I like the Driftwood Theme!"
308609,Spiel,2009-02-20 13:05:00,9065,"  You're welcome.  The ""Driftwood"" skin is now the default skin which is to say that is what anyone not logged in will see. Once logged in members have a choice of ""skins"" available by utilizing the drop down menu in the lower left corner. I believe that there are still members unaware of this option.  Perhaps I should have chosen the ""Lavender"" as the default...."
308614,Greencoachdog,2009-02-20 13:14:00,8163," I haven't tried the lavender skin, but may prefer it over the driftwood! I find the driftwood skin very depressing for some reason   and that log mocks me!!!  The club skin is my fave... except for the christmas skin at christmas time."
