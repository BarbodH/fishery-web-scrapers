I'm assuming its still completely frozen over... but I'd just like to get some confirmation from someone. Anyway,  HERE IS WHERE THE LAKE IS  - If anyone could provide a 'Conditions Report' about this lake, I would greatly appreciate it - Thanks guys!"
307412,rbaquial,2009-02-17 16:08:00,968,Anyone?
307415,ricoboxing,2009-02-17 16:15:00,398,I believe ice fishing is not permitted there. I think the reservoir is only to fishing from May - November
307417,rbaquial,2009-02-17 16:16:00,968,Oh yeah? Ok... thanks!
307472,jediangler,2009-02-17 20:05:00,1923,"Rico is right, no ice fishing is allowed on this conservation lake. It opens for fishing on pike opener. That doesn't stop the poachers from fishing there pre season though. No live bait and a limit of 2 pike, 2 bass and 10 panfish. Also fishing from the railway tracks can bring you big fines for tresspassing. No gas motors allowed on the lake as well. It might be 8ft deep at the deepest but most of the lake is between 3-5ft with the weeds growing fast to the surface. By the end of June it is hard to use even an electric motor and paddling is about your only way to get around.  "
307482,rbaquial,2009-02-17 20:34:00,968,Thanks Jedi!  When exactly is PIKE OPENER? May... isnt it?
307488,purekgw,2009-02-17 20:42:00,585,the pike is really good there nothing huge but fun
307519,jediangler,2009-02-17 21:39:00,1923,"I've seen more and more people keeping pike and the average size has decreased over the last 5 or 6 years. We used to get one over 30"" every year, now if you get one longer than 24"" out of there you should be pleased. Many people target bass before season opens and that has had an adverse effect on their numbers as well. I've never tried for crappie at Mountsberg but have heard that there are some in the 12"" range to be found. If the pike numbers keep going down look for the crappie population to really take off."
308048,ld17,2009-02-19 01:18:00,319,"I slammed this 15"" crappie there last summer. "
308087,rbaquial,2009-02-19 02:45:00,968, Were you using LURES or LIVEBAIT to catch that slab?  I wanna give a shot at Crappie... never caught one before!
308186,jediangler,2009-02-19 13:41:00,1923,"Nice slab LD17, were you after crappie or was it an incidental catch?"
308310,ld17,2009-02-19 19:38:00,319,"This one was an accident.  I caught 3 bass with a 4"" worm.  Was working my way around some weeds and had a hit.  I set the hook and figure another bass.  Just as I bring the thing up i freak and tell my buddy it's a crappie.  It's my biggest to date.  Just before this one I finally caught one 13""  that was at binbrook.  Now this one.  I've fished this spot a number of times targeting crappie and in about 6 drifts of the area I bagged 2 14"" 2 13"" a couple of 12 and 10's.  It was amazing.  To boot I slammed some of the biggest gills I've ever caught that must have been pushing 10+ inches.  I was using 1"" tube jigs.  You have to check this place out.  I practice catch and release on all the big fish."
