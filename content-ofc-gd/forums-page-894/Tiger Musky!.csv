307903,Headhunter,2009-02-18 19:43:00,5703,Anyone else see this? http://www.syracuse.com/outdoors/ Please don't shoot the messenger! HH
307905,Fishnwire,2009-02-18 19:52:00,983,I wouldn't have kept it.  You guys?
307907,bukee,2009-02-18 19:54:00,58,Nice fish.  If tiger's don't reproduce why not keep it then an get your world record?
307909,Marko,2009-02-18 19:58:00,854,"Measure it and take a quick pick and throw it back, who cares about the record. Fish of a lifetime for sure!"
307910,tinbanger,2009-02-18 20:02:00,1028,Nice fish  doubt that after a 1/2 hour fight and been gaffed it would have survived a plunge back down the hole !  TB
307914,purekgw,2009-02-18 20:25:00,585,i feel bad for that nice fish
307930,cram,2009-02-18 21:19:00,1733,"It can't spawn, and is a potential world record....i have no problem with that.  I do have a problem with ice fishing muskies though.  Be thankful that Ontario is a little more intelligent with its fishing regs."
307939,muskeybugged,2009-02-18 21:31:00,282,"Nice fish.  Oh well, never planned on fishing that lake anyway. Someone show that guy the Dale video. said a prayer for the fish!"
307944,tinbanger,2009-02-18 21:39:00,1028,"Having an ice season is the real problem .Releasing in open water would be a lot different ( better!) than trying to release a fish that size down a 9"" hole !  tb"
307950,FISHINGNUT,2009-02-18 21:50:00,253, I agree
307963,codered,2009-02-18 22:39:00,123,thats a record size tiger ? i thought that they would be bigger for a world record
307966,Joey,2009-02-18 22:47:00,9122,"Well it's his fish to do what he wants with, shouldn't matter to us either way.  Very nice looking fish.  Will make a beauty mount.  Congrats to him.  Joey"
307972,Greencoachdog,2009-02-18 23:02:00,8163," I agree Joey!... if all was legal, it's his right to harvest that fish if he wants to!  The only thing that might bother me would be wasting the meat if it was fit to eat... but fish that size aren't usually fit for consumption.  Congrats to the Fisherman!!!   ... I wonder what size Wall-ice he was using for bait?"
307973,BigSmallie,2009-02-18 23:10:00,61,"It does say ""The fish appears to have broken the existing world record for a tiger muskie caught with a tip-up, "" so it is only a tip up record and not a world record  for all angling types? Still beautiful markings."
307976,Jigger,2009-02-18 23:12:00,1237,"Alot of fish are swimming easier in that lake tonight. Hope I come close to that one day. 25.88lbs is the Ontario min size requirement. So it'll be a heck of a fish, one pretty close to that size, that gets the record here!"
307979,Terry,2009-02-18 23:14:00,14456,now this is a tiger muskie           
307986,camillj,2009-02-18 23:27:00,1988,mmmmmm .... muskie burgers !
308011,blakewalk,2009-02-19 00:23:00,86," good point; still a beauty though- i wouldnt mind that on a mount if it cant reproduce- besides, it prolly wouldnae survive going back down"
308012,blakewalk,2009-02-19 00:24:00,86,bahaha!  nice one! whatd you catch that baby on- a mac or a pc?
308173,chickenhawk,2009-02-19 12:43:00,612,too bad that fish had to die......but congrats to the angler
308242,ehg,2009-02-19 15:58:00,2666," There have been 2 tiger muskies caught over 50 lbs in Lac Vieux, Wisconsin. The Ontario record is around 35 lbs from Longlegged Lake in NW Ontario. So it's not a world record but an ice fishing tip-up record. Nice fish all the same."
