308462,Jet,2009-02-20 01:49:00,364,Does anyone know any stores in the GTA other than Lebaron's that carries HH float suits. They didn't have my size and I don't know what other store carries them.  Thanks in advance.  jet
308465,ld17,2009-02-20 01:50:00,319,Fishing world and bills bait and tackle in Hamilton has them.
308545,Cudz,2009-02-20 03:58:00,2652,"If you are up Barrie way, Simcoe Bait and tackle have all sizes and they are $229."
308551,Jet,2009-02-20 04:17:00,364,  Thanks for tip. Yea I will be up that way Saturday on Simcoe. Do you know if they carry the Alpha suit? I presume the $229 is for the Delta correct?
308622,ecmilley,2009-02-20 13:23:00,2163,"I believe that hirks marine in courtice sells them, give dave a shout at 905-576-8600"

308662,Jet,2009-02-20 14:31:00,364,Thanks everyone for your input. Found one at Hirks and it has been ordered! Thanks ecmilley.
308672,motion,2009-02-20 14:57:00,403,Just a question I was looking to buy a suit myself. Are these Helly Hansen better than the Mustang type. Are they warm as well?
308678,JMahon,2009-02-20 15:16:00,48,"I can't speak for the Mustang suits, but I have the Delta suit & I find it really warm!   It's pretty bad when it's    -30 out & your still sweating!  lol    & from what I hear the Alpha suits are that much warmer!"
308685,Jet,2009-02-20 15:36:00,364,"  This is what I noticed after initially leaning towards the mustang. For practically the same price at Lebaron, the Mustang Classic ($284) has a better hood but only a few pockets.  The Alpha ($279) has a ton of pockets, neoprene cuffs, better fastening systems on sleeves and ankles, several tightening straps and suspenders which is great when things get to warm as it will keep things from falling down. It also felt as thought he insulation was more substantial.  For the money, the Alpha had much more value."
308692,motion,2009-02-20 15:47:00,403,I see that crappy tire has the two piece Mustang on sale for 124.99 each piece. Are the one piece better?
308693,Jet,2009-02-20 15:50:00,364,"One piece is warmer for sure, naturally. If you fall in then one piece is much better as it restricts water inflow much better."
308695,motion,2009-02-20 15:51:00,403,"Jet, I thought so too. Do you find the one piece mobile enough to fish comfortably?"
308702,Jet,2009-02-20 16:09:00,364,"If you get the proper size, you should have no issues moving around. That said, stop in at Lebaron and check it out. They have both. Try sitting down, bending, pretend you're cutting holes in the ice, and I'm sure you'll have a good idea if its comfortable for you."
308722,GBW,2009-02-20 17:01:00,8460,"Contact Hirks for a price on the MS-185, I'm sure you will be happy.  I do.  I'm 6' tall and was 185LB when I went to Hirks to try some on.  I went with an XL so I had the room to bend and not tear the arse out if I bent over.  They sell both brands too..."
