308114,nautifish,2009-02-19 04:10:00,1416,Almost.  Well as you know this girl has been busy creating her very own fishing room in her home....It is something i have always wanted and i have been busy as hell the last two day's which is why one has not been around much.  But i have almost got her done. All i need do now is decided whether i want to add new carpet or go with wooden floor in my room.   Tough Decision.  ..lol I have not made my mind up yet and am still pondering....I spent almost 12 hrs yesterday just hanging wall paper all on my lonesome...Let me tell you at 12.10am this morning i was hurting in places i never even knew i had. :-/ Its been allot of work but i am soooo happy with the way my room looks now.....  Hopefully you can remember what it looked like before.  I promised i would post pictures when fishished. So  am adding some pictures that i just took this evening......Sorry to those of you on dial up.... I need a cup pa char and a bloody holiday...lol... ;D                    PS all iam looking for now is some moose antlers and if anyone happens to have a mounted deer head they no longer want donations are gratefully excepted....lol.. ;D
