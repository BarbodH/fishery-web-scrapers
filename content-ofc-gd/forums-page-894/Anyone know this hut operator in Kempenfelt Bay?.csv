Lots of Whitefish and Lake Trout. Minutes from shore by foot. Transportation if needed. 4 man heated huts, bait provided. 705-728-8215      Kempenfelt huts http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-ho...QAdIdZ103735182   Has anyone here know or heard of this operator. I want to rent this weekend, but he has no pictures or website. I'm taking 3 rookie icefishers and want to make sure it is at least decent. I've tried to find other operators in Kempenfelt with no luck.  If someone has can recommend an operator in that area please do.  Thanks!"
308102,linweir,2009-02-19 03:30:00,202,Is he a registered operator? I guess he just rents his own hut. Why dont you call him? May try if price is reasonable.
