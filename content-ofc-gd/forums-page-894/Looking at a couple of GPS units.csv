308320,fishnsled,2009-02-19 20:41:00,3520,"I've been shopping around for a while for a new GPS unit.  Keeping with in my budget I have it narrowed down to 2 units.  Does anyone have either of these units and if so what have you found to be the pros and cons of each.  For the others who don't, which would you buy and why.  Thanks for your input.  LMS-522CI  Or  787C2"
308328,tschirk,2009-02-19 20:58:00,261,I was a Humminbird user and upgrade to lowrance 2 yrs ago. I now have the previous version of the 522. IMHO Lowrance has superior performing products while Humminbird has more features. I'll take performance over features any day. Cheers Ted
308329,muskeybugged,2009-02-19 20:58:00,282,"I've got the Eagle 642c, love it.  Price at Radioworld seems high though.  I got mine at JB's for more the price range of the two you listed I think.  I don't think you can go wrong either way.   Not much input on the Bird, sorry.  http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?cPat...roducts_id=3034  Few differences that you'll probably never notice"
308346,Tom McCutcheon,2009-02-19 21:47:00,627,My brother has the 522C on his boat on the dash. It is a great unit and very easy to use. However he is probably going to put it up front and get the X27C or X28C HD just because they are larger and easier to read. Have never used anything else other than Lowrance or Eagle.  Tom
308358,Sinker,2009-02-19 22:32:00,8692,"I'm also a converted bird user. I'd never go back. All those extras on the bird are just more crap to confuse you, and you won't use half of them for normal fishing. Lowrance has it covered.  Lowrance all the way!!  Sinker"
308416,NANUK,2009-02-20 00:40:00,797,Lowrance!!
308457,douG,2009-02-20 01:43:00,2693,"Er, I have two words for you:  Garmin.  On the other hand, I don't know anything at all about the products you have on your list."
308504,mukluk,2009-02-20 02:40:00,196,Lowrance!
308513,Radnine,2009-02-20 02:49:00,1538,"I do not know about either of the model numbers that you have mentioned, but I have an Ifinder H2OC and the learning curve is steep. Loaded with features that the space shuttle might use. Me, not so much. Jim"
308516,Grimace,2009-02-20 02:53:00,2020,I have the Bird and I love it.      That being said I have been in boats with the 522 as well and it is top notch.    Personal preference.   
308674,lew,2009-02-20 15:04:00,12766,"Never used either of the models your looking at there Will, but if it means anything, I use Lowrance for both my GPS and sonar units and am very happy with the way everything works.  Their repair facility is also just out in Mississagua too if you ever need any work done to them."
308679,BillM,2009-02-20 15:16:00,17367,"We run a 747C with external GPS along with an Eagle Intellimap 500C Chartplotter with Navionics Gold+ chip.   It's nice to have the chartplotter with full screen navigation.   I'm not a fan of the split screen, unless you have a highend unit with a monster screen)   "
308749,Billy Bob,2009-02-20 18:11:00,5865,I have a Lowrance 520c unit and it's a great unit. Same as the 522 but with remote GPS antenna.  What's nice about the Lowrance products is they can be networked together if you want one on the console and one up front at the bow while using the trolling motor.  Most PRO's go with Lowrance and just today Lowrance announce it's new 2009  HDS units can add side imaging. This will definitely blow away Humminbird.  Bob
308759,fishnsled,2009-02-20 18:35:00,3520,"Some great input guys, thanks.    Good point Lew.  I checked and the Humminbird facility is in North Bay.   Hopefully you never need one but good to know."
308827,River Rat,2009-02-20 20:58:00,161,"I have a 520C and external antenna so I could hook it up to my 27 on the consol. You can ethernet link screens, and Neima link GPS it to another graph, hook up gauges, fuel system, downriggers,  etc....it gets one of the satelite radios thingys too (XM i think).  also, I made a way cool portable unit out of the 520 with a power cord and transducer from Anging Outfitters.....took a case I had and a 12vlt rechargable and made a great ice, and canoe rig.
