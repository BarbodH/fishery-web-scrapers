308082,limeyangler,2009-02-19 02:32:00,5204,AWESOME JWL....
308182,corvette1,2009-02-19 13:19:00,1765,great job jack save a few for the tourny on sat
308202,jwl,2009-02-19 14:21:00,1056, is there a tourney going on from your side of the ditch this weekend?
308222,smokin joe,2009-02-19 14:59:00,226,Nice job   once again Jack  Seems all the fish are biting on the days I have to work may have to play hooky one day and get out with you
308225,jwl,2009-02-19 15:04:00,1056," was going to take the boat out today but not very motivated to do so when I woke up and heard the wind outside, snow, not so much trouble, but the wind is coming a crappy direction for the river and supposed to hit up to 45klicks....somehow alot different than waking up and the sky is all sunny  I owe ya a time out Joe, we gotta get out there soon man..weekends might be a little tough for me for a bit though...wife is back to work, only way to get out on weekend is a day that she starts at 4..as long as I am back in the driveway by like 3:30 it's all good  PS, it's the river, if you know where to fish and how to fish em...they're biting everyday"
308237,ehg,2009-02-19 15:52:00,2666,Nice bunch of trouts from the Niagara  I'm thinking it's a good thing your on Team 1. We'll do good this year!
307704,jwl,2009-02-18 04:15:00,1056,"Got out for a couple hours on the big river again today with a good buddy of mine in my boat...  We didn't get in the water until about 12:30..he had the first fish in the boat at 12:39  , not bad   . Sometimes we don't know how to take that though..is it going to be a banner day..or did we just get jynxed.????   It took over an hour of expereimenting and working a quiet spot until I broke the ice with this hen     got her back in the water and straightened the boat back out to continue the tail end of the same drift..I got this little premmie....soon as he got in the boat..asks me..hey...got milt?     We broke down the area, I found the hot bait, and it was funny becasue the rest of the fish where pretty much in order...boy. girl..boy..girl kind of thing. This may be a great sign of things to come!!!             I only wish we had a bit more time today...we fished just over 3 hours and went 7 for 9, my buddy was a bit bummed that 6 of those 7 where mine...kept bumming he couldn't fish becasue he had to keep bringing in his line to net my fish and get a pic for me  was fun for me"

307790,jwl,2009-02-18 14:08:00,1056," I occasionally ice fish at my trailer for pike and walleye, didn't get the chance this year though..as for the most part..I find myslef hard pressed to go and catch a few dinky perch through the ice when I can hit the river in the boat or from shore and catch fish like that every time out"
307791,jwl,2009-02-18 14:09:00,1056, already got one pretty much that big this season..but in November
