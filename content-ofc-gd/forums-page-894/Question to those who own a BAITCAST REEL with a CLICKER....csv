308574,rbaquial,2009-02-20 09:03:00,968,"This question is to those who own a BAITCAST REEL with a ""CLICKER"" on it... or more specifically, an ABU GARCIA C-Series Reel...  When fishing...and the ""Clicker"" goes off indicating a fish has taken the bait.... is it safe to ""Dis-engage"" the reel WHILE fighting it? or, should it be left alone and just fight the fish with the 'Clicker' engaged? If anyone could help me regarding this, I would really appreciate it - I've picked up 3 of the ABU's all with 'Clickers'....and I don't want to ruin them on its 1st use...  Thanks!"
308583,Greencoachdog,2009-02-20 10:52:00,8163,"You can do either, most people like to disengage the clicker before fighting the fish."
308688,rbaquial,2009-02-20 15:39:00,968," Is it OK to disengage the clicker WHILE fighting it? or should it be disengaged before setting the hook? (just asking, incase i forget to disengage after I've set the hook)"
308694,eye-tracker,2009-02-20 15:50:00,89,"Disengage the clicker when reeling in or fighting a fish to prevent it from prematurely wearing out. The clicker is more than a sounding device, it is also used to keep tension on the spool when free spooling out line, which prevents over-runs and backlash tangles in the line.  -sheldon"
