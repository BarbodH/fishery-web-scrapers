308336,dannyboy,2009-02-19 21:15:00,367,"Wow Bigugli that sure looks good, 60% wheat?  I work in Beamsville so I'm sure if I just step outside I can sniff my way to your oven, I have some smoked char that will go nicely with that.  Dan"
308337,Dusky,2009-02-19 21:16:00,310,"Seeing this, I can hardly blame the family!!"
308375,misfish,2009-02-19 23:16:00,29133,"We were hungry,and could of used some of that bread to dip there bigugli.   This snowy weather brought the heat out tonight.   "
308378,crappieperchhunter,2009-02-19 23:21:00,2582,"You gotta stop doing that I live is Oshawa....and I swear I can smell it here!!!  Nothing like a slice of warm bread right outta the oven with some butter on it.  We have a bread maker, and have been making our own bread and pizza dough for 5 years or so...the only bread we buy is white bread when we have a turkey...cause Debbe still prefers using it to make stuffing."
308387,bigugli,2009-02-19 23:36:00,6138," You are probably smelling the baking from my Mom's place off Taunton  As for dressing. Tell the wife to buy day old buns or save the end crusts and dry them out. Makes a superior stuffing,"
