Does anyone know of a shop that would clean/fix it up in the richmond hill/Markham area or even newmarket?  Its only a $65 reel but id rather pay 10-20$ to fix it verus ditching it.  Thanks!"

753391,BillM,2012-12-20 15:53:00,17367," I doubt it, just bunged up with a lot of salt.  Have had it happen to a few of the Saharas I've fished in saltwater.  Nothing a once over with a toothbrush, some fresh water and a light oiling won't fix."
