753644,zenon11,2012-12-21 17:11:00,75,"Actually I just re-read it and you can sell sharks in Ontario, but not local species of fish . Still a cool story"
753645,whiskywizard,2012-12-21 17:12:00,305," Fined for possessing it, or selling a mount?"
753932,fishindevil,2012-12-22 22:55:00,6254,They should be a lot more worried about the sale of live Asian carp !!!!! And that's still going on .... Grrrrr
753936,Rich,2012-12-22 23:12:00,3927,"The fish was caught under a different country's sets of laws for capture, and taxidermy. He's perfectly legal to sell it here as it already passed border patrol years ago, legally. I doubt he concealed that thing in the vehicle to get across.  Cool story for sure.  If it were me I think the story would be more similar to Brad Paisley's ""I'm Gonna Miss Her"" lol"
