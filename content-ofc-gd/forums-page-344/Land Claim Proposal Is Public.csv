753090,Andy,2012-12-19 00:52:00,330,"  I'm with Moosebunk on this one, although I can't agree with some of the tactics used by Natives, i.e. Caledonia. So many issues need addressed for the betterment of all, but is the goodwill there on both sides? I don't see it. It seems like even the native communities can't agree with each other on many issues, unless they decide to stand against the common enemy of the government, then the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Maybe I'm naive, but how do you even begin to address the boundaries of a relatively nomadic people living 150 to 400 yrs ago, with no legal concepts or principles such as individual property rights, in an area shared by other native groups living on, and fighting over, or sharing, the same lands? But that being said, if a deal was made 200 yrs ago, a deal is a deal, and we need to work it out. And I don't think expressing an opposite opinion does not automatically make you a racist. The word is thrown about too freely. I know, a lot of words for two cents."
753091,fishindevil,2012-12-19 01:14:00,6254,I'm 100% opposed yes I am but it does not make me racist is correct it's the way I feel and oh yes I forgot to say my girlfriend of four years is full native on both sides or her family she has no status card and does not believe they are entitled either !!!!
753263,dickie,2012-12-19 21:15:00,64,"What is it with all the native unrest in this province. We in the London area just had a native protest about their treaty rights by having a peaceful march, meanwhile holding traffic on the 401hostage for a few hours. WHICH WAS ILLEGAL. The police did nothing and the natives knew that. They fell they are above the law and entitled. If we had a roman style of gov't we wouldn't have this problem. If you were conquered you abide by roman rule, abide by their laws, become an asset to the roman empire, or you wern't allowed to live. A little hard maybe, but in the end the rewards were the same for everyone. It,s either conquer or be conquered. Most of civilization was establihed that way"
753265,Headhunter,2012-12-19 21:30:00,5703,There is quite a bit of un-rest in the country. Native groups have taken to the internet to form social groups and in turn a united front. They are coordinating efforts coast to coast. You can find out more here: http://idlenomore1.blogspot.ca/ HH

In my opinion the natives have become greedy (we taught this to them)....and KARMA is biting paleface back....the natives run Lake Huron now....but i still get to go out on the lake in my boat and catch fish without having to pay them....and co-incidentally my tax dollars paid for the construction of the boat launch but my government wants 10 dollars each time i use it...There are many layers dealing with the native issues....both sides are at fault but i dont think youll want to dig too deep to see who is at more fault...because im afraid youll be looking in the mirrow of your family tree

Things can be discussed civily, but Ive seen too many threads locked lately just because a mod didnt share the same opinion, or saw someone prodding to lock it.

752888,aplumma,2012-12-18 13:41:00,6896, Actually the countdown of a level headed person should BE a warning. The reason most threads get locked is because of the report button which we encourage everyone to use. Pushing it does not mean we will lock it it means we will review it and make the decision. This thread is still going because it still has some FACTS to be presented the opinions expressed are allowed only if they 1. do not bash an individual person and 2. do not attack a group of people without a base of facts. Politics and religion are two subjects that bring out passion and stupidity and are the quickest to go wrong and locked.  Now back to the thread.    Art

This is the step that everyone says in hindsight they should have spoken up.  I'm neither for it or against it, I believe I could actually register as an Algonquin. I don't think half of what you see or read will actually make it to law"
752919,jedimaster,2012-12-18 15:49:00,3472,"This is a lasting and broad sweeping topic that has the ability to affect every outdoorsman even if your favorite honey hole is not one of those currently splotched with red or pink. As everyone knows the way the law works is by precident. The Algonquins are trying to set a precident here. There motiviation as they say is that they owned the land and that Canada as a government stole it from them. They have marked a section that stretches from North Bay to the Quebec border and from North Bay along the algoniquin park border, then around Smoke Lake down the edge of th epan handle through haliburton encompassing bancroft down towards frontenac island and up to the quebec border.  They are contesting that this stretch of land was theres and should still be there's. They have come up with a first proposal of what they are willing to accept as land given back to them. These are outlined in more detail according to all of the little maps. This includes both Crown Land and Private Land. Much of the crown land is currently within  but not limited to Algonquin park.  Here is what I have objection to on this matter.  The land was not stolen from tha Algonquins, they were not tricked out of it. Battle lines were drawn and the land was take under act of war. Good or bad right or wrong. That is how the world works. That is how nations are created. If that did not happen neither you nor I would be here living in ontario today. Any non native would all be back in Eurorpe, or Asia, or Australia, or the carribean or Africa or wherever else you came from, or of course as I will point out living in the united states. I was born here, my parents were born here, but go back far enough and they were born elswhere.  Here is a little history on canada in case you were sleeping in grade 11 history.  just the higlights of course  1497 on June 24th John Cabot landed on Cape Breton and claimed the land for King Henry the 7th 1508 a colony established in Labradors 1520 Portuguese mapped the Gulf of the St.Lawrence 1534 Jacque Cartier ""re-discovered"" the St.Lawrence and called the land kanata, later called it Canada 1605 The first permanent settlement in canada was established 1608 Champlain claimed Quebec was claimed by france with the aid of Huronia Indians 1615 Catholic missionaries were sent to Canada to convert the natives, held the first mass in Ontario 1629 The english overthrew France and took over quebece 1632 a treaty was signed and Quebec was returned to france, for the next 25 or 30 years Quebec/New France was under constant attack by the Iroquis and France declared war against the iroquois 1745 British took control of New France 1807 Slavery abolished in Canada 1812 We should all know about this US versus Canada, Toronto(formeerly known as york was burned down by the Yanks) on Christmas eve in 1814 a peace treaty was signed that ended the war. 1818 The 49th parallel  was established as the border  Of course lots happened in between and here is thing to understand. If the British did NOT take over Quebec and seize control over Canada from the natives, this land would all be part of the United States. If the war of 1812 was not won than we would all very likely be part of the United States or not here at all.  So what does that have to do with the Algonquin Land claim? Well I just don't see where they have any right to the lands that were taken, maintained, governed, protected and ruled for the last 500 some odd years. The british colonizing what is now ontario and defending it from the French/new france/quebec, and later the Americans is land that is encompassed within the Algonquin land claim. To say that the algonquins should have this or any of that land back is like saying France has rights to quebec and it should be given back as well.  It purely makes no sense to me whatsoever.  What is the motivation? Purely its about pride and money. It is most certainly expected that much of the land will just be resold/leased out to cottagers.  Now what would you do if you actually though land was yours and was taken by some governemnt that you do not recognize. Well all around the world this is what starts a war. Will there be a war? Most certainly, the war will start out with talks and attempted legislation, this is where we are now. If the land is not given back you can almost be certain that blood will be spilled once again over the very same land where is was spilled many times before. Of course if the land is given back the Candian's will just accept it and move on. The question is should we?  What do I think  should happen? I don't think the government should set a legal precident for giving back land that was already taken, claimed, defended and ruled. Right or wrong, good or bad, this land is canadian land. The Algonquin's live within canada and should have the same rights to that land as you or I. Extra rights are even granted that already cause great harm to the fisheries as we all know. To expand this is just insane in my humble opinion.  If you ask me? I say give nothing, and fight for it if needed. I would stand a fight for it. Would you? Many I guess will disagree and say we should just give some back, or pay them off or whatever. but I think its just wrong.  Thats my piece on this matter."
752921,Terry,2012-12-18 16:02:00,14456,your flaw is  we never conquered the natives...we made treaties with them to stop hostilities now they are holding us to promises that were made 
752927,jedimaster,2012-12-18 16:12:00,3472,"What treaty was signed that stated they would be given land some 500 years later? The treaty's were allready agreed upon, signed and paid out.  This is about the algonquins wanting to back in time and re make the treaty and emend what they are claiming should have been in that. Well it wasn't in it then or it would currently be so now."
752928,Moosebunk,2012-12-18 16:12:00,3970,"My understanding was that this land claim (and wherever it stands now with its considerations by both the Algonquins and Parliament) has been floating about since sometime in the early 80's.  That's 30 years of going nowhere if be the case.  It's like somebody said though, you go into negotiations asking for the galaxy, you still might just get a planet or two.  But I bet this claim is still light years away from really going anywhere.   You look at a Treaty Map, you will see there is a country which was signed, sealed and delivered through our history.  http://manitobawildlands.org/maps/HistTreatyMapCan_lg.jpg  If you can find a decent map which shows our Countries Reservations you will see there is a National community living with us.  http://www.pgic-iogc.gc.ca/DAM/DAM-INTER-IOGC/STAGING/images-images/ai_pubs_ar0809_2_1301074557452_eng.jpg   It is noted that many people live, economies grow and businesses can and do thrive on lands around Reservations and upon Treatied lands.  Albeit, as old and tired as the agreed upon documents of which Natives and Settlers negotiated upon to found this country and define their futures, this history does exist and there is legal right which does give ground for Natives to safeguard their treatied lands and/or seek land claims by order to do so.  There is very much and always has been concern amongst Natives to protect, and see to it that the Treatied terms agreed upon are being upheld.  The Non-Native populace has grown so far beyond their own today, that everyday the world can't help but encroach more and more upon what Native's feel is either theirs, theirs to protect, or that to be shared equally.  There is no equal measure at 99 to 1, even though some would oppose that math over the smaller scale issues of say, fishing, hunting, or tax dollars given to this minority.  They are losing the land (and what it means to them) on many fronts, but they stand up for themselves, and even try to fight however they can.  I'll admit to admiring that tenacity.  Native plight is understandable with regards to this issue, and many others.  That said, land claims, Aboriginal funding, living conditions, hunting/fishing rights and every other consideration under the Indian Act of Canada is what the Government and Natives truly need to address.  It is in truth the Indian Act itself; (and there does exist some support by Native peoples, but not Councils) which needs to be completely reviewed and modernly restored, or just abolished entirely by anything that can supercede it; such as Human Rights.  The only way there is any hope in heck of any proposed change to become reality is, for those to get talking and to get working on it.  Like this particular claim itself, again my bet is that will take another long while."
752940,bushart,2012-12-18 16:41:00,2628,"One may really need to wait on this before it gets any more carried away  Ask Yourself how this will affect you directly and personally?  If you accessed that land for fishing or hunting---will it blocked?  Will the new landowners pay tax on these parcels?  Is this more about not affecting you directly and somebody's getting something and your not  If You do not have the definite answers on these----maybe waiting or asking authorities would be a more ""TOLERANT"" approach than drawing lines in the internet sand.  And Yes to what Terry said"
752948,jedimaster,2012-12-18 17:08:00,3472,"Specific to what Terry said. The treaties were all signed and honoured long ago. This is not about land that was not paid paid out or a treaty that was not already signed, sealed and honoured. This is about a new claim to what the Algonquins are now saying should have been included in a claim a that was already signed ages ago. Actually they contested in court that there was no such claim. It was stated in court that there was no legal liability on the part of Ontario or Canada to forfeit this land through the court process. In an attempt for peacefull exchange the Ontario government said that they would be willing to negotiate some sort of settlement out of court settlement to make the Algonquins happy.  I would argue that this land was actually taken by force and claimed legally and it was forfeited over the course of the 500 years from when Canad was established and defended.  The reality is that a deal was struck to come up with some form of payout. The current proposal for land is in insane. What I think will end up happening is that anythin on crown will be given away and anything private will not. There will be native revolts as there were in caledonia and people will be hurt. Hopefully this does come to a peaceful end. However I can tell you that this will not likely be the last of it even when this has been agreed upon. There will be further disputes and claims resulting of whatever comes of this. That is just my opnion though."
752955,dickie,2012-12-18 17:35:00,64,One thing I agree with.IT WILL NEVER END and I will make another WE WILL ALWAYS GET THE SHORT END OF THE STICK
752957,Oggie,2012-12-18 17:53:00,588,"Well greater legal minds than mine have studied this issue. If they feel there is an outstanding landclaim then I'm willing to go along with their decision. I'd hope by settling and with the passage of time some of the tensions around this issue would disippate. we're too far down the negotiating road to begin to question whether we should negotiate. By starting to negotiate we've validated the landclaim so let's getter done!  I would hope that the First Nations develop some self-sufficiency once they are given a modest landbase and a start-up investment. Hopefully they don't cut a cheque for everyone on the list and then lapse back into the same sad state they're in now (reserve living conditions).  Once treatied some of the issues related to Native priviledges/rights must get tightened up so that there is one set of rules on crown land.  Hopefully the MNR can go back to enforcing those rules evenly on the EAstern side of Ontario. Court rulings on First Nations rights have made it impossible to enforce the Fish and Game laws in this area.  On a different note, the Algonquins did use both sides of the Ottawa. Do they not have a landclaim in Western Quebec?  Dan O."
752959,Terry,2012-12-18 17:57:00,14456," then we have nothing to worry about the courts will read the treaty and say all treaties have been fulfilled.. can you show me anything that states treaties were honored, paper work from courts. anything..this is the first that I have heard that all treaties have been honoured......  think I will google the word honoured."
752960,jedimaster,2012-12-18 17:58:00,3472,The area being claimed as Algonquin land has never been officially recognized as having ever been part of the Algonquin territory at any time. As to where the lines actually orignially were I am not sure anyone including the algonquins themselves really know.
752962,jedimaster,2012-12-18 18:01:00,3472,  Do you actually think it took the algonquins 400 years to realize that they were never paid for or the land was never taken from them? To think this is nothing other than give us more because we want it is a bit nieve. If they in fact were never paid for than the court case in the early 90's would have ruled in favour of the original algonquin claim. It was realized that through back door dealings that its better to just do this out of court for fear of a violent end.
752977,Rich Nelson,2012-12-18 18:54:00,332,"I dont think we owe them anything. I think billions of dollars a year is good enough no? Canada is made up of many backgrounds and nationalities. They all have an equal opportunity to work hatd, be successful, and pay for what they want. Why is it still different for natives? To me, the solution is to pay them off, once and for all ( wich will cost billions, but it cost that every year anyway) and be done with it. They can become tax paying citizens, and follow the same rules as everyone else. The double standard is just not working. Or, they can do what they want on their reservations, but on public land, abide by the same rules as everyone else. I am not classifying all natives in one category, because there are plenty that are hard working, honest people that arent mooching off the rest of society. Keep working hard and paying your taxes boys. Millions on welfare and collecting handouts are depending on you!"

753084,Cookslav,2012-12-19 00:16:00,1457," I guess that’s the fundamental issue I have with this claim. I didn't sign or agree to any treaties...neither did my Dad, nor my Grandfather, nor did his father. Nor did any member of the Current Algonquin band. In fact with regards to this particular claim there is no treaty....there never was. Its a claim...a simple rudimentary claim and petition getting some current press.   If this claim is even given consideration We're opening Pandora’s Box with regards to claiming indigenous rights for land ""historically"" inhabited and land that was simply assumed into Canada when conceived. There is ALOT more land in Canadian jurisdiction that could fall under that precedent....Virtually all of Canada actually.  Under these arguments any particular claim with no previous treaty now is open for debate...."
753086,fishindevil,2012-12-19 00:23:00,6254,Well lets just put it to a vote on a poll just for the heck of it and see what the results would be ??? Lol
752666,dickie,2012-12-17 22:01:00,64,The natives don't want this land. The only thing they want is MONEY. 15-20 years ago the natives wanted ipperwash provincial park and the army land. The gov't gave it back to them and they absolutly trashed the whole area. They were dissappointed that they did not get a money settlement. When is enough enough?

752711,Rod Caster,2012-12-17 23:31:00,5784, Seems yes. All utilities and right of ways also will have to pay the self-governing band. They would fully control the lands. Public parks and designated areas will remain public use.It would be a full transfer of land from Canada/Ontario to the Algonquins.

752765,Steve,2012-12-18 00:47:00,2075,"actually, it shows how folks really feel about the issue.  if that means it stinks, well, then that should tell you how folks feel about it.  not that if folks dont agree, then their opinion, or feelings, stink."
752767,Cookslav,2012-12-18 00:56:00,1457," Best quote of the thread LOL... It was the first thought that crossed my mind word for word  Now this is a rather uninformed opinion here but I'll lay it out anyway. I don't get how these claims hold any merit anymore... Most were written, signed Bartered for or accepted LONG before I was born. Some if not most were agreed upon before my parents were born and yes even before our grand parents were born. I fail to understand how it is acceptable to NOW come out of the crowd, step forward and proudly lay claim to agreements that have been long past due or out dated by generations? Sure some of these deals were forced through, and some were simply bummed deals that natives accepted for menial things like whisky....so not to argue semantics but what’s come to pass is the past so let it go.  If not we're opening Pandora’s box.... Maybe I should lay claim to property my family once owned in Poland which we lost when Germany occupied Europe? Sure I wasn't alive, my parents were not born yet but it was taken from my Grandparents under tyranny which they didn't agree to....so ya...I should be given back the land that now houses a city and make a mint off of some lease because its my birthright? If it sounds ridiculous thats because it is...  This Particular claim is kinda Ludicrous in my opinion The basis of the claim is that they never ceded their rights through treaty and never sold or lost their territory through war. It was simply taken as part of Canadian territory when we were conceived....welcome to Canada eh? These claims were brought to the crown as being their territory since apparently 1772 via a petition...which the crown has denied being there is no documentation supporting the claim outside of the actual petitions.  So its not a deal gone south, its not an agreement past due...its a simple claim for land not allowcated, given, settled, or occupied by the Algonquin band as home since Canada was a nation. Its simply a claim to past lands once occupied many generations ago. I guess thats fair? I say if one single person from 1772 can come out and raise their hand....well I guess I'd be inclined to support their claim. Maybe even some one from 1872???....what about say 1900??? no...maybe 1925....1930? Anyway you get my point C'mon now....enough is enough."
752769,Oggie,2012-12-18 00:57:00,588,I can see this landclaim being accepted in some form or another.  I would likely accept the landclaim but as a taxpayer I'd want this agreement water tight.  No more subsidies to the treatied group (or anyone claiming to be wronged by the treatied group). The Province of Ontario doesn't have the money to buy out the claim so they are going to offer high priced real estate as compensation.  I just don't think ANY agreement can be watertight with the Court system we have. You never know how they're going to rule in First Nation cases.  One of the problems will be who are the Algonquins? I know for a fact people who were card carrying status Algonquins are now being disqualified as Algonquins as the Land Claim comes to fruition.  ie. they're cutting they're own people out of the pot of money! The idea being if you can disqualify half of the people on the First Nation list then you double the windfall for those that remain.  Dan O.
752773,aplumma,2012-12-18 01:00:00,6896,Let's get back to facts and not speculations on what is going to happen.   Thanks  Art

752779,Oggie,2012-12-18 01:09:00,588,So let's sum it up! There WILL be a Landclaim Treaty. What we're trying to do is suggest how the Agreement can be most palatable. If you have a chance take a look at the various maps and information by following the link in the first post. Commenting here won't likely make too much difference. Writing your MP and MPP will make a difference. Talk to other outdoors people and make them aware of the proposed changes.  This is a proposal so they are looking for adjustments/modifications etc.  Thanks for any input you can provide.  Dan O.
752781,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-18 01:15:00,10439," Been going on up here since the 70's and it's still no where near being resolved. And yes the claim area has been out and published that long too!!!  I'm sure the claim there in Ontario's North East will be settled about the time, time travel becomes possible."
752783,Rod Caster,2012-12-18 01:16:00,5784,"Worst countdown ever Randy haha  Fact is, IF this proposal passes, probably not exactly as proposed, these lands will be fully in the Algonquin's control. In the proposal's document, ""Canada and Ontario will be transferring land"". Roads and some parks and publicly used areas will likely stay the same, but they will have sole jurisdiction over their land. It'll essentially be a country within a country. Interesting stuff.  Like Dan said, if this concerns you, read the executive summary and review the maps.  http://www.aboriginalaffairs.gov.on.ca/english/negotiate/algonquin/preliminary-draft-aip.asp"
752793,Cookslav,2012-12-18 01:32:00,1457,"Ya I read it...and then some...its lot of legal mumbo jumbo and jargin.  Unfortunatly the bigger picture for me is the ""right"" of the claim and most other claims of this nature as well.   This pretty much sums it up and bothers me on many levels."
752795,Rod Caster,2012-12-18 01:34:00,5784,"Keep in mind that this is only an Agreement-in-principle potentially going up for Ratification by the Algonquins in 2013. From the document:   ""Upon a successful Algonquin ratification vote, the final draft Agreement-in-Principle would be submitted to the Governments of Ontario and Canada for approval. Following such approval and signature, the Agreement-in-Principle would be a non-binding statement of the main elements of a settlement of the Algonquin Land Claim that would form the framework for future negotiations towards a Final Agreement. Negotiations leading to a Final Agreement could then begin. A Final Agreement would also need to be approved by the Algonquin of Ontario and by the Legislature of Ontario and the Parliament of Canada."" Basically, this is the review process for the framework of the final proposal, with no set date. Lots of paperwork before this one gets completed.  Now is the time to send in your comments to the negotiation teams... no matter where you stand on this issue."
752278,Oggie,2012-12-16 16:50:00,588,I may have missed the discussion on this topic and if I have my apologies.  The Algonquin Land Claim Proposal is public. It affects the Eastern side of Ontario from North Bay to Ottawa. If you recreate in this area or you pay taxes to the Province of Ontario you might want to educate yourself by having a look at the maps.  Dan O.  My link
752293,kickingfrog,2012-12-16 17:23:00,8333,I need a dumbed down version to fully comprehend the documents.
752308,Oggie,2012-12-16 18:16:00,588,"The red areas will be given to the Algonquins. Most of the areas are crownland and contain hunt camps.  Algonquins will own the land privately; it's not reserve land. No trespassing and no access to non-natives.  Much of the land given is waterfront.  Many assumed the land given would be part of a huge block so that the First Nations could manage, hunt, fish etc. Not so. They were allowed to cherry pick the high value crown land (waterfront) in a mosaic pattern.  This has never been done before apparently. Dan O."
752405,zamboniwaterboy,2012-12-16 23:15:00,126,Well that seems insane!
752411,Terry,2012-12-16 23:32:00,14456,"well if we owe it to them, we should pay our debt it is only a small fraction of the claim through out Canada  this had better end all claims from that band"
752417,fishindevil,2012-12-16 23:47:00,6254,It isn't going to happen and we all know it !! I can see where this is going to end up ... It ridiculous to think the govt will simply hand it over not gonna happen....
752421,Oggie,2012-12-16 23:50:00,588,Terry I hope it ends all land claims as well and if it did I think I'd almost swallow it as is. It isn't the amount of land they want it's the fact that it's some of the best shoreline land in Ontario. They still reserve the right to hunt over half of Algonquin Park as well of course.  Of course you realize this will set the precendent for all Ontario land claims. Will it upset you when they cherry pick the Kawarthas or the Grand River watershed?  Dan O.
752422,Terry,2012-12-16 23:52:00,14456,well it's that or we declare war on them
752423,Rich Nelson,2012-12-16 23:53:00,332," Wanna bet? The government is scared to touch these issues with a 10 ft pole... They would much rather give them what they want so they dont cause problems. But... Give them an inch, and they take a mile. Just look at Caledonia."
752427,fishindevil,2012-12-16 23:57:00,6254,Caledonia was not 8.5 million acres of land either the govt will not just hand over this huge insane land claim and just forget about it that's for sure
752428,Gerritt,2012-12-16 23:59:00,6129,"Problem here is three fold...  either they buy off the bands (setting precedent) for all other land claims....  Or  they give them the lands (Setting precedent again) for all other land claims..   Or they drag this out in the courts forever.... (Most likely to happen)  The government is POWERLESS against this group....(except to stall the inevitable) in the end they will get what they want.....   Do you really think the Government is going to just hand over Toronto? (Yes part of a land claim made by natives)...   An end will have to come.. I just hope it's not with violence.. (Not the first time we have experienced a civil war....)   G.  Edit to add.. I lived in Caledonia when DCE happened... and I know all to well, they will fight to the death... and the people of Caledonia stood up against their tyranny.... sadly our government let them down... caving to the minority yet again.  Caledonia now has racial based law... they are instructed NOT to arrest the illegal occupiers of DCE (even in near death beatings!)... but to arrest the regular towns folk of Caledonia should a problem arise...  Seen it with my own eyes."
752431,fishindevil,2012-12-17 00:08:00,6254,
752433,fishindevil,2012-12-17 00:13:00,6254,"Yes I'm sure people with million dollar properties are gonna let them so called ""cherry pick"" their properties hmmmm don't think so,not to mention all the tax base the govt would be out it says 1million people live in the area that is in the land claim including the largest military base in Canada !!! It's just absurd .... To think of the huge issues and remember everything is always all about money !!! Just that fact alone means its not going to happen"
752436,Twocoda,2012-12-17 00:19:00,4130,this is what happens when you pay native kids to go to school...they get educated and grow up
752441,big guy,2012-12-17 00:23:00,414,One of the red areas on the Frontenac map includes a road that I access to fish. I will not be happy if this goes through and I can not access those lakes again.
752442,Twocoda,2012-12-17 00:26:00,4130, you will still be able to access the lakes im sure...youll just have to pay an admission fee or boat launch fee...
752445,big guy,2012-12-17 00:30:00,414," Well I do that now as part of the Township fee to maintain the roads and crown land sites, so that won't be too bad as long as the fees are reasonable and they keep it maintained to the level it is now"
752457,Oggie,2012-12-17 01:01:00,588,By offering crown land to the First Nations the govt has essentially paid for the treaty. The newly acquired land will be sold for cottaging. Wonder if the natives get the taxes?
752458,Twocoda,2012-12-17 01:06:00,4130," they wont sell the land...Im thinking they will ""lease"" it like they do the Sauble Land...."
752600,Rich Nelson,2012-12-17 17:50:00,332,"Fishndevil. The multi million dollar property in Caledonia was bought out by the government after the owner was beaten within an inch of his life for entering his own property. The governments solution? Buy the land, but they dont have the balls to remove the natives that are now on government property. Any non native caught on the propert are arrested by OPP ( if the natives dont get to them first) They arent going to get millions of acres in Algonquin, but they will get a bunch of prime land ( making it seem like a nice solution). Its like gas prices jumping to a $1.50 pr liter, then everyone is happy when it drops to $1.30.  Reality is we are still gettin ripped off at $1.30 Lets face it... If the natives push hard enough, they will get what they want"
752601,jedimaster,2012-12-17 17:57:00,3472,"I would think there will be blockades setup at all of the red and purple splotches on the maps. Enter and you will be beaten by the natives until the government caves in, just like in caledonia. There is already strong precident for this."
752629,moxie,2012-12-17 20:15:00,1566," Not only is it going to happen but its as good as done. Laughable. I'd like to see us Band together and tell the Provincial Gooberment We refuse to pay our property taxes until we have done whats right. Who knows, we might all be sitting on disputed and/or claimable land. Fat chance huh? Spineless, gutless Cretins."
752646,torco,2012-12-17 20:51:00,656,I certainly do not know a lot of the details but a lot of you guys are coming across racist in my view. Just my two cents.
752656,moxie,2012-12-17 21:28:00,1566,"   LMAO!!!! I don't know any facts but I think I'll just label them"" Racists"". You can have those two cents back if you like."
752659,moxie,2012-12-17 21:36:00,1566,"    They lay claim to the land and they suckered a group to manage it. At our expense of course. That mean we have to replace trees in the case of them wanting to do a little logging? How about fish stocks? Do we re-stock on our dime once they've emptied the bowls? On second thought it is Racism. Reversed Racism. Difference is we won't fight back. You want examples of land claims, there are plenty on the books, past present and more coming down the pipe. Racist???"
