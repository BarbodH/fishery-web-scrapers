753614,LucG,2012-12-21 15:14:00,779,"I though I'd need the tool too, but I was surprised how easily they were to screw in by hand.  Also, you can simply bring a drill bit slightly smaller than the anchor screws and pre-drill your holes, makes screwing them in even faster."
753625,mike rousseau,2012-12-21 16:06:00,4661,I do it by hand... Not a big deal...  But hears the tool... You can order parts and accessories direct from Clam...  http://clamoutdoors.com/ice_fishing/http-clamcorp-com-ice-fishing-shelter-acc/tools-shovel/ice-anchor-installation-tool.html
753628,Terry,2012-12-21 16:14:00,14456,"just use a drill bit ti make a bit of a hole, it makes it real easy to screw in"
753635,registerfly,2012-12-21 16:30:00,198,yes pilot one if hand is too much. Always by hand since a drill would be more space taken up.
753648,LucG,2012-12-21 17:31:00,779, Exactly
753675,EC1,2012-12-21 20:08:00,930,Go out and buy a set of screws from Eskimo if you can find them. Took one from a buddy and it makes all the pilot holes for me now. For some reason the clam ones really suck.
753729,wormdunker,2012-12-21 23:01:00,1711,"I have ice screws from CTC also a pointed spud.  Punch a starter hole with the spud, screws thread in very easily.  No need for a cordless drill.  One less item to carry, or to forget at home!"
753735,Stoty,2012-12-21 23:05:00,2910,"Or... a cheap DIY method is to buy a broom stick handle and cut it into 4 one-foot long pieces. Drill a few holes around the outside of your hut, attach rope to wood, and shove the wood under the ice to ""brace"" against the bottom of the hole. Tie the other end to your hut.  Kinda like a dog trying to walk through the door with a stick too long to fit through.  Sure, you have to drill a few more holes and get your hand wet.... but pretty cheap option!"
753742,Guest,2012-12-21 23:23:00,0,I just bought my first ice tent a few weeks ago and I didnt think the anchors would be a problem getting in.  I was just planning on hammering them in with a hammer.  Any tips guys
753749,mike rousseau,2012-12-21 23:39:00,4661,  They screw in...  I've never had a problem....  The softer the ice the easier it is.... Cold dry black ice chips and breaks a bit.... But eventually the ice anchors will grab....  And you only need 1 or 2 on the side of the hut getting hit with wind....  I usually only use one on my flip over so it doesn't blow away when I'm checking my tip up...
753753,Guest,2012-12-21 23:49:00,0,"  Thanks dude.  I was planning on putting in all 4 of them in all the time.  Was probably gonna put them in even if it wasnt windy.lol  Im pretty new to this ice fishing tent thing.  Only put my tent together twice in the backyard.  Caught nothing, but nobody would catch anything when your minnow is sitting on top of your lawn. haha"
753756,mike rousseau,2012-12-21 23:52:00,4661, If you have a pop up you might wanna put all 4 when its windy....
753815,kenzy31,2012-12-22 04:01:00,261,"Start them with a hammer, twist them in by hand 3-4 inches. Takes all of 3 mins to get it anchored and banked with snow"
753816,Oggie,2012-12-22 04:02:00,588,"Every once in a while somebody reports a tent rolling by on Cooks Bay. Definitely anchor your hut as soon as you feel that wind come up, especially with a pop up. I've neglected to anchor my flipover and by the time I realize I'm in trouble   I wouldn't dare take my butt out of the chair until I flip everything back down and even then she wants to travel..
