753683,Terry,2012-12-21 20:27:00,14456,"Innisfil Beach or Tyler Derby (same Location) has perch closer to shore, whitefish and lakers a bit farther out..might be the best spot, if weather ever gets cold"
753688,davey buoy,2012-12-21 20:34:00,5505," Ininsfil beach has a lot of parking to doesn't it?,that may be even a better location,as someone may know where the whities are:clapping:"
753714,Terry,2012-12-21 22:09:00,14456,I knew where they were 2 years ago   but that changes all the time
753715,misfish,2012-12-21 22:15:00,29133,  LMAO BUDDY
753716,Rod Caster,2012-12-21 22:18:00,5784,"Sweet, sounds like there is some interest. Hopefully Alex logs back in soon haha.  Its probably best for the simcoe-local-yokels to figure out where to go/park/fish"
753724,misfish,2012-12-21 22:52:00,29133, Thats no way to talk about Terry.
753725,wormdunker,2012-12-21 22:54:00,1711,"The bet is ON!  Large Timmies & a breakfast sandwich is at stake!! Innisfil beach park sounds good.  Lots of parking, easy access, & a short walk out to the perch grounds."
753726,misfish,2012-12-21 22:56:00,29133,"Whats the going rate this year, to park there?"
753727,Rod Caster,2012-12-21 22:56:00,5784,"  Haha, it was directed at you too"
753730,Stoty,2012-12-21 23:02:00,2910,Quinte...???
753733,Hoppy,2012-12-21 23:04:00,95, I don't know because it's free for us local yokels.
753734,misfish,2012-12-21 23:04:00,29133,"  To far far for the ,simcoe-local-yokels."
753738,Rod Caster,2012-12-21 23:10:00,5784,The north bay yokels would prefer parking for free on the ice anyway haha. Would that even be an option for Simcoe?
753739,misfish,2012-12-21 23:18:00,29133, Hi ya Hoppy.
753741,NAW,2012-12-21 23:23:00,4022," Everything begal.  Bacon.  LDD.  :sarcasm:  If you bring your quad, I'll show you some honey holes for Whities!  After some fun with the perch of coarse"
753745,Christopheraaron,2012-12-21 23:25:00,3525,Wherever it is I can't wait!  Who's bringing the fryer?
753837,Freshtrax,2012-12-22 06:00:00,2215,"Let me know where. Out of Ibp.  it's a pretty far treck to most of my honey holes but I'm sure between us we have enough sleds,n four wheelers to make it happen."
747301,Joeytier,2012-11-27 23:26:00,3990,"Well you managed to outfish the lot of us on Nipissing last year, so maybe perch will give us a fighting chance..."
747306,NAW,2012-11-27 23:40:00,4022, Maybe  I LOVE Simcoe perch fishing!
747309,davey buoy,2012-11-27 23:47:00,5505, Isn't Simcoe up to two lines per person for ice fishing?. Can't seem to remember.
747311,Terry,2012-11-28 00:03:00,14456, yup 2
747313,sleepjigging,2012-11-28 00:12:00,207,Hooters is a FAMILY establishment.
747315,hockeyplayerz_14,2012-11-28 00:16:00,160,Simcoe can work out and thanks for the help misfish
747321,dhickey,2012-11-28 00:39:00,1038,If I may I would like to put my 2 cents into this?  I would be more than willing to help organise an event such as this. Allthough we can't predict ice conditions I think it fairly safe to say that Cooks BAY WILL BE SAFE.   I fish out of Lefroy and never had any problems with safety .Its a good starting point for those with sleds or ATV'S.  I will have a hut out there and from what I gather through past post so do others(call out).  It would be a great time ..  Bring out the portable BBQ'S cut some holes and everyone comes and goes as they please..  Like a block party?  Hey maby the admin would concent to giving us OFC  stickers to put on our huts? At least then you would allways know a friend. That would set OFC above the norm...
747340,Acountdeleted,2012-11-28 01:26:00,2562, I just put 2 and 2 together and came up with 4..... do you guys mean Little Lake In Peterborough?  Edit: Or the one in Barrie?
747341,livinisfishin,2012-11-28 01:28:00,661, Little lake in Barrie
747344,Acountdeleted,2012-11-28 01:34:00,2562, Gotcha. I wouldn't mind trying there. I have a ton of lakes I want to ice a line on this year.
747347,livinisfishin,2012-11-28 01:42:00,661,I hear ya..ive got a few new places in mind plus the usual haunts.
747373,sleepjigging,2012-11-28 03:43:00,207,biggest challenge: Parking
747479,misfish,2012-11-28 16:37:00,29133,Lots at the pike grounds and a 2 minute walk.
747497,Rod Caster,2012-11-28 17:05:00,5784,"Anywhere on simcoe would work for me... As would nipissing, but that might be too far away for Alex, and we might get a Nip 2G2 in addition to this one."
747570,OutdoorDan,2012-11-28 21:13:00,325,"Definitely in whether it's on Simcoe, Nip, or wherever else.  Had a great time last year on Nip.  Would be glad to help out with food and I *might* be able to get my hands on a BBQ."
747870,Locnar,2012-11-30 00:57:00,645,"I like the idea of Cook's Bay, and I plan on being there... as long as my work schedule doesn't screw me over."
753496,Rod Caster,2012-12-20 23:02:00,5784,Any interest in still setting this up Alex? Will Simcoe even get safe ice this year?
753589,wormdunker,2012-12-21 13:08:00,1711,Cooks Bay sounds good for me.  Had a blast on Nip last year.  I'll bring burgers & buns if someone can commit to bringing a BBQ!  I'll be too busy hauling in fish to volounteer to cook!  HA HA! Bring on the ice!
753659,davey buoy,2012-12-21 18:46:00,5505,"I'm in,Cooks bay freezes first in Simcoe.Last year the main lake never really froze over safely,Cooks will be froze tight by 2nd week of Jan I would think. Still check first."
753666,fishnsled,2012-12-21 19:11:00,3520,"  The gutsy ones might be on the ice next week (weekend) I would think. With the winds calming down and the cold temps coming in, it could set up pretty fast if the weather holds. Be safe gents! I'll see you out there mid January. lol!  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0342"
753667,davey buoy,2012-12-21 19:24:00,5505, No need to rush it foresure:good:
753674,NAW,2012-12-21 20:03:00,4022,I'll make a appearance at cooks bay... Just for a few minutes so i can out-fish worm dunker!!!  Then back out to the deep for the whites!!
753676,davey buoy,2012-12-21 20:09:00,5505, Would love to check out the deep sometime;).maybe?
753679,NAW,2012-12-21 20:13:00,4022,Hopefully we can make it out that far this year.
753682,Locnar,2012-12-21 20:22:00,645,"I'd like to try the deeps as well, never seen a whitie in my life... would like to change that."
746815,hockeyplayerz_14,2012-11-26 18:59:00,160,"Hey everyone, as far as i know we do an ice fishing get together. This year i will be there as long as i convince my mom. This year i was wondering if we can dedicate this one to my dad. as most of you know a week after the 2012 gtg he passed away doing what he loved to do, snowmobiling. I hope this can work out and i know for sure he will be there like he was on my birthday as i was fishing the BPS open on lake simcoe and won big fish ""lunker pool"". The best gift a kid can ask for. I know its a couple months away but i just didn't want to mention it last minute. What do you guys think? any lake suggestions?"
746817,Roy,2012-11-26 19:02:00,13728,You pick the water and let's see what happens.
746834,BucktownAngler,2012-11-26 19:57:00,582,simcoe? k-bay?
746879,Fisherman,2012-11-26 21:13:00,7201," The only thing that smells fishy in K Bay is _____, and there ain't no tuna in there."
746892,davey buoy,2012-11-26 21:38:00,5505,"How about Cooks Bay(Lefroy),south end,somewhat easy for a lot of people. Meeting time,meeting area,walk out if you want to?,could be a lot of fun and a lot of members able to show up! Just a thought?"
746901,Rod Caster,2012-11-26 22:00:00,5784,"I'd try my best to join wherever we decide to fish.  If Simcoe, maybe I'll land my first ice-whitie! Something I've been itching to do.."
746933,Roy,2012-11-26 22:51:00,13728,You can also wait til mid February and do the Tyler French event. Just a suggestion.
746936,e-z-out,2012-11-26 23:08:00,1052,What ever you decide I'll be there with the kids
746937,Acountdeleted,2012-11-26 23:10:00,2562,Simcoe Cooks bay would mean lots of action all around which could be fun. Also wherever we meet up maybe I can bend some of the more seasoned ice fishermen and womens ears for some tips?
746938,nancur373,2012-11-26 23:11:00,1211,Pigeon?
746940,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 23:14:00,3525,"I like the idea of cooks, lots of species and not too far for most. As long as it's not ridiculously far I'm in."
746941,livinisfishin,2012-11-26 23:16:00,661,Would like to try a kawartha lake...is scugog any good?
746945,misfish,2012-11-26 23:19:00,29133,"Are you looking at just getting out with OFC members and having a day on the ice in memory/celebrate,  your father,or a fund raiser? If you want just a good day,no matter the catch and a good time,I would say little lake. No matter where,I will be there."
746947,livinisfishin,2012-11-26 23:21:00,661,Little lake would be fun to
746948,davey buoy,2012-11-26 23:22:00,5505,"The only reason other than fish,Cooks Bay freezes usually before new years and stays solid and safe in most cases easily till March. Easily accessible. Wherever you choose hopefully there will be a good turnout. If your looking for Whities a different location may be needed."
746949,Nipfisher,2012-11-26 23:22:00,2449,"Alex, I would love to try Cooks Bay for some jumbos.    I extended this offer to you before, if you ever want to come back up here and fish Nipissing I will set you up in the ice shack or in our spare room and make sure you get on/off the ice safely."
746953,GBW,2012-11-26 23:29:00,8460,"You do need to figure that out too.  Pick some locations you have in mind then post a poll.  As for the date, work that out with your Mom and stick to it!  The more you try and move it to help out others the harder it get's for you to do.  Good luck and if I can make it I'll be there too."
746955,misfish,2012-11-26 23:32:00,29133,"I would also like to add to his request.   I see no reason why the fund raiser could not be changed. After all,the Tyler event came from a GTG Speil started,then I took over. It would be nice to share the wealth.IMO.  Im sure the same turn out would be the same,and the same gathering would show,with the same excitement."
746964,misfish,2012-11-26 23:57:00,29133,KARMA
747041,Jen,2012-11-27 04:22:00,833,Post a place and a time and I am in... sounds like a great day on the ice!
747061,wormdunker,2012-11-27 08:25:00,1711,"Hey Alex good to hear from U.  We had a blast last year.  Name a place & date we'll be there. 2 Brians, 2 crane operators."
747273,hockeyplayerz_14,2012-11-27 22:26:00,160,"I was just thinking a GTG but with the tyler event would be great also. Nipissing was good, lots of fish and different species. Simcoe is good but to get to white fish territory you need a sled or atv. Cooks Bay is a good idea too. Who organizers the tyler event. PM me and we can talk further."
747274,hockeyplayerz_14,2012-11-27 22:27:00,160,just a gtg not a fundraiser.
747279,misfish,2012-11-27 22:31:00,29133,"Alex,I use to do one after the close of Lakers and whities out from Hooters for pike/perch. If you just want a GTG,that might be an option. The last few years,the ice has sucked.Hard to get on.  Maybe we can talk later about it. Lots of time. I would be more then willing to help you out."
747285,NAW,2012-11-27 22:44:00,4022,"  You should throw it again this year Brian.  Pike in the morning.  Hooters for beer (and scenery) in the aft.!  I think Alex is of age..  If not, he sure looks the part"
