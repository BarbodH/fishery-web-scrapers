753425,Skipper D,2012-12-20 17:42:00,1970,Has any one heard of any Hickory wood plants getting robbed north of Montreal yet ?
753426,Billy Bob,2012-12-20 17:45:00,5865,I have LOTS and LOTS of Hickory Wood...it's what I mostly use to heat the ranch...  As matter of fact...I was splitting a bunch of it early this morning for kindling that I use to start my wood fires in the stove.
753442,kickingfrog,2012-12-20 18:57:00,8333,Sounds like bb is burning the evidence.
753454,aplumma,2012-12-20 19:54:00,6896,"Brian I am sure I have never had the good stuff because it was fed to us at a lodge we went to in the past. It was tough, round and defiantly not sweet. We have since brought our smoke cured bacon with all of the bad stuff the pig could put into it.  Next time we meet up I will look forward to some real Canadian bacon and I promise to tell everyone down here it is still horrible so there is not a run on the border.   Art"
753456,Billy Bob,2012-12-20 20:01:00,5865," Well, you can only eat so much Sugar Maple, Hickory Smoked BACON....."

753126,dhickey,2012-12-19 03:50:00,1038,But they taste good.
753127,Slop,2012-12-19 03:57:00,151,Tabarnoosh...  Inside job
753135,funfishing,2012-12-19 04:33:00,147,I bet a lot of Americans will get a good laugh in reading that story
753138,solopaddler,2012-12-19 05:04:00,8605," In another story 10,000lb's of Canadian Back Bacon was stolen recently from a meat packing facility north of Montreal.  Police suspect the two heists may be related."
753154,grimsbylander,2012-12-19 11:47:00,3016,The police are staking out egg farms and pancake mix factories just to be safe.
753165,Rod Caster,2012-12-19 12:59:00,5784,The breakfast bandits!! Lock up your chicken coops and bakeries.... I sense they are about to build the worlds largest french toast
753172,bushart,2012-12-19 13:37:00,2628,See in the 60's-70's----Sweet Quebec Gold---had a whole other meanin
753251,aplumma,2012-12-19 19:40:00,6896,O.K. the maple syrup I can see people in the US wanting but that Canadian Bacon y'all can keep....yuck    Art
753254,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-19 20:35:00,10439, Keep it up an we'll ship 1000 metric tonnes of poutine South and dump it on your front lawn!!!!!
753268,Headhunter,2012-12-19 21:41:00,5703,I hope the charges stick! HH
753276,aplumma,2012-12-19 22:19:00,6896," So I had to ask Google what Poutine is and while it sounds good to me I got a laugh from this line in the description.  ""Poutine is Acadian slang for mushy mess and is best described as a heart attack in a bowl.""      Art"
753277,misfish,2012-12-19 22:34:00,29133," Not if you use sweet potatoe/Yam, fries. It,s the starch that will kill ya.   Are you sure you had the real stuff? I call it peameal bacon. The sweetest bacon on the earth,next to Maple smoked that is."
753280,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-19 22:42:00,10439,"  Who cares!!! We don't want them darned Yankees touching our beloved Canadian Bacon AKA Back Bacon!!!!  <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/4jf8Bt4gD9Y"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
753285,misfish,2012-12-19 23:00:00,29133,LMAO Dave.
753399,Billy Bob,2012-12-20 16:44:00,5865, I agree with the Canadian bacon...not good....but we have a LOT of our own Maple Syrup in NYS and many other states including Vermont which is a top producer of Maple Syrup....  We never see Canadian Maple Syrup down here in the Buffalo area.....mostly home grown NYS Maple Syrup from only 40 miles south of here.
753403,Headhunter,2012-12-20 16:57:00,5703,"But BB, most of that stuff is on fire! HH"
753406,Billy Bob,2012-12-20 17:04:00,5865, I'm not sure what the hell you're talking about...but hot maple syrup on vanilla ice cream is the BEST...
753408,Headhunter,2012-12-20 17:10:00,5703,"It's been my understanding after watching Buffalo news off and on, that most of western NY is a blaze most of the time... so unless they have the syrup in a fire proof installation, I'm guessing it's either on fire or about to burst into flames! HH"
753411,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-20 17:16:00,10439, He's talking about the nightly Tonawanda fire report on channel 4.     :tease:
753412,Billy Bob,2012-12-20 17:17:00,5865," OH....that's the City of Buffalo....most normal people don't live there anyway's....it's now a waste land....best would be to fence it in and let them kill themselves without out our interference...  But anything east and south of the City is very nice....and some areas north until you get into Niagara Falls, NY...it just as bad as Buffalo or worse...another fence would work there too."
753413,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-20 17:21:00,10439,Any time I drive thrrough there I feel the need to be driving one of these!!!  
753414,Billy Bob,2012-12-20 17:24:00,5865, That would be good in Toronto too....Better yet on QEW to get to Toronto...
753417,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-20 17:27:00,10439," NAH, we use these in T.O.!!!  "
