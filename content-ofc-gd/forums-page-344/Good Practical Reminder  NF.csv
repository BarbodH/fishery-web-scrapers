Community Service Officer Kevin Hildebrand says that officers will be targeting impaired driving by setting up RIDE checks every day throughout the festive season.  To put things in perspective, these are the average expenses for a convicted impaired driver. Legal and courts - anywhere from $2000 to $10,000 Criminal Code Fine - $1000 Alcohol Education and Treatment Program - $578 Administrative Monetary Penalty - $150 Increased Insurance – estimate $4,500 extra per year for three years = $13,500 Ignition Interlock - $1,300  The total minimum cost would be about $18,128, plus applicable taxes on some items and actual costs may be even higher.  Other costs may include property damage, loss of employment income and uninsured medical costs.  If your blood alcohol level registers from .05 to 0.08 in a roadside test, you can lose your license for 3-30 days. If the driver is under 21-years-old, there is a zero-tolerance to any amount of alcohol in the driver’s system."
