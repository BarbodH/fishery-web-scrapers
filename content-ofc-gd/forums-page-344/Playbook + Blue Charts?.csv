I thought it would be great to have a 7"" display for Navionics mounted on the boat and especially with cheap Android tablets now available. Ended up with a Blackberry Playbook last year that is nice but has no native support for a lot of Android Apps. Another problem with Android apps is that they are made for small screen and really don't scale up well.  The Playbook is a great device for the price but I really miss apps like Slingplayer and Skype.... Okay back to fishing.  Recently found a app called ""GPS Nautical Charts"" that seems Playbook friendly.  I inquired about possible maps and was told the Trent Severn waterway including Lake Simcoe and nearby lakes was just included.  Has anyone tried this app? It has a trial version and I've installed it but sitting in a living-room is tough to test it!  "
