Since they make 60 percent of the winter tires in the world (including many models sold under other brand names, as well as tires used on big rigs, aircraft, and busses) I assume they know a thing or two about this.  I was told all tires contain silica. It is the proportion of silica to rubber that makes a difference when driving in the cold. The more silica, the more the tire will remain flexible in sub-zero temperatures, providing better grip and iproved stopping distance. That applies equally whether the tire is driven on snow, on ice, or on dry pavement.  Do I think winter tires should be mandatory? No, I don't. But there is no doubt they do save lives. Quebec apparently believes that it is far easier to simply make them mandatory than it is to get people to use their common sense.  They may be right on that."

750834,craigdritchie,2012-12-10 21:30:00,1586,"Lots of terms being tossed around in this thread, and it's worth clarifying a few things.  ""Snow tires"" and ""winter tires"" are not necessarily the same thing. ""Snow tires"" have a more aggressive lug tread than the average summer-use tire, so they give better traction in loose snow. Otherwise, they're chemically identical to regular summer tires.  ""Winter tires"" are made from a different chemical mix than ""normal"" tires. It varies from one manufacturer to the next, but most have a high percentage of silica in the tire material. This allows them to stay soft and elastic in freezing temperatures, which gives you better cornering, better handling, much better traction and substantially better stopping power - even on dry pavement. Because normal rubber tires contract in the cold and become harder, your stopping distance increases as the temperature drops - even on dry pavement - and it can increase by as much as 25 percent! ""Winter"" tires mitigate this. People who say ""I don't drive in thick snow"" don't understand that winter tires are intended to work on dry pavement too.  Quite honestly, the difference between winter tires and all-seasons is like day and night. I live in the GTA, and I was amazed when I tried winter tires.  Having more silica in the tire material gives better traction, but the trade-off is that being softer, they won't last as long as regular summer tires. This is especially true if you run them in summer, during hot weather. Most have a max tread life of around 80k, but if you run them year-round, it's more like half that. So use them only in winter.  Before someone asks, yes, you can have ""winter snow"" tires - that is, snow tires that are made with lots of silica in the rubber. But not all snow tires are necessarily also winter tires. If you drive in varying conditions and that's what you want, you need to read the label before you buy.  ""All season"" and ""all terrain"" also mean different things. ""All season"" may have more silica than standard tires, but not nearly as much as winter tires do. ""All terrain"" usually describes properties in the tread pattern, like snow tires, but are chemically standard.  Winter tires are the law in Quebec because they save lives. Why not just offer insurance discounts to people who use them? It doesn't help if you get killed by someone who didn't buy winter tires. You're still dead. Does the discount still matter?"

750691,DanD,2012-12-10 13:51:00,2223,"Give the snow tire law a couple more seasons to prove itself out before stating how well it’s done. I haven’t researched this but I don’t believe they implemented a minimum tread depth for winter tires, as to where a snow tire looses its effectiveness. There’s nothing here in Ontario to facilitate what a worn out snow tire is; it falls under the same rule as a summer and all-season tire. No two wear bar indicators shall touch the road surface in two adjacent treads; in other words almost a banana skin. Yes people are following the law by having winter designated tires on their vehicle at a certain date; but there’s nothing stopping them from spinning these snow flake tires all year round. Let’s see what this law has done for the winter accident stats after a couple more winter seasons, when all these new snows are 75% or more worn out. I run a garage; we do a lot of seasonal tire changes and I can tell you first hand that some of these used winter tires that we’re installing are just a pacifier for the owner. Anything worn past 70% (and I’m being generous here) tread on a winter tire is no better then running a decent all-season. Yes the rubber construction is different for a winter tire; but a banana shin is a banana shin; there’s a reason snow tire tread depth starts life out at 12 - 14/32 and summer/all-season at 8 - 10/32. I’m all for winter tires but they have to be treated and replaced like a winter tire; you can’t run them down like a summer and still have the traction.  Dan."
750695,bigbuck,2012-12-10 14:12:00,2449,"The govt doesn't need to tell me what to do even more than they do. If you feel you need snows on your car, by all means, buy a set. I'm confident in my driving ability, both my vehicles have good rubber on them and if there is a lot of ice on the road, I'm staying home and off the road. I'm not worried about myself, its all the other drivers on the road that I worry about."
750708,SlowPoke,2012-12-10 15:08:00,2984,Dan raises an excellent point. Accident data could have shown remarkable improvement if our government mandated NEW ALL SEASON tires by Dec 15 every year.  You guys still in favour?
750709,ecmilley,2012-12-10 15:10:00,2163,"danc is correct on that with tire wear on snows, there is a secondary wear bar on most snow tires that is between 4/32 to 5/32 above the first one when this bar is exposed the tire is considered a all-season so really only half the tread depth is snow-rated. also people in quebec can't drive really if you look on a map montreal is pretty much on the same latitude as north bay snow tire rule does make some sense in that regard they have consistent snowfall all winter, southern ontario just use up your 3-4 sick days and stay home"
750714,Squid,2012-12-10 15:31:00,1656,"EC your rocking the boat here?? ""also people in quebec can't drive""  So you consider yourself an 'expert"" I have driven in Quebec and in Ontario and I'd say its an even split. There are idiots here too and you just may be one of them, we don't know"
750715,Squid,2012-12-10 15:32:00,1656,You guys need to understand that folks on the bottom of the pay scale cannot afford snow tires for any price regardless if it 'could' save them in an accident. The lower income folks are more concerned about what to EAT than putting on snow tires.
750717,Spiel,2012-12-10 15:40:00,9065," Maybe they should give up their vehicle, maintenance costs, fuel costs and insurance costs. Might not only save their lives but also the lives of others...."
750718,mercman,2012-12-10 15:41:00,7054,"Yup. Winter tires save lives.Winter tires in good condition though. The Stats here i Quebec prove it, with a phenomenal drop in fatalities in this province since the manditory law was instated.I am interested to see in the next year if fatalities begin to rise again after all the brand new tires installed a couple of years ago, begin to wear down. Most people cant afford the 1000 dollar average expense for good winter tires every few years."
750731,SlowPoke,2012-12-10 16:09:00,2984," You are no stranger to hard times. Did you give up your van and boat? That's none of my business and I don't expect an answer.  Would you have been disgruntled by a law mandating you spend $1000 on tires for a van that wasn't worth $1000? I don't mean to personalize this but for Joe Average, getting to and from work on using public transit isn't always an option. In Southern Ontario, winter rubber isn't necessary the vast majority of the time. I trust Joe Average to make a responsible decision when and how to drive on those few days and nights when winter rubber would be beneficial."
750734,ecmilley,2012-12-10 16:33:00,2163,little sensitive time of the month maybe don't understand
750737,Spiel,2012-12-10 16:36:00,9065," The short answer is yes, I did give up my vehicle and all associated costs.  I've also never gone without food for me and the kids, if I had the boat would be gone too and it has come close but the vehicle was the money pit.  As for mandating snow tires, no I don't agree but after having gone without them for over 30 years then installing some several years back I'm now convinced they're worth it. I can't put a dollar value on my daughters safety."
750738,Billy Bob,2012-12-10 16:37:00,5865, Ya...that's what Ontario needs...more government mandates and restrictions...
750740,mercman,2012-12-10 16:42:00,7054,"The Quebec Gov. was influenced by the SAAQ(our no fault insurance) to mandate dedicated snow tires on all domestic vehicules, in an effort to reduce death and injury. It has done that and more."
750742,whiskywizard,2012-12-10 16:44:00,305, Isn't SAAQ the liquor store?      .
750743,G.mech,2012-12-10 16:47:00,830,"I know this will NEVER happen but rather than the government mandating snows (which seems inevitable in this granny state), why can't the insurance companies offer a rebate for those of us who need or choose to run them?  If the accident rates are reduced they should be able to give some back right?   I'm not going to hold my breath....."
750745,SlowPoke,2012-12-10 17:08:00,2984," I guess we're on the same page.  I think Pete's point was 'do we really need another expense when it's hard enough to meet day to day financial obligations?'. Not so much as 'do I get a tank of gas OR put food on the table?'.  There's no debate over winter rubber putting the odds in your favour but some may experience more hardship in being forced to park a vehicle during the winter months when a simple, common sense decision is what's necessary."
750749,mercman,2012-12-10 17:30:00,7054," I was waiting for you to chime in  Societe d'Assurance Automobile du Quebec, mon p'tetite bloke"
750751,Jigger,2012-12-10 17:36:00,1237,"Its not you that you need to worry about, its the other drivers. I drive on all seasons. I dont need to justify why, but its not because im cheap. I drive from Durham Region into Toronto everyday and can assure you that the newfound ""confidence"" that drivers feel with snows on makes alot of them drive like its the molson indy.  If i give up my vehicle, i cant go to work. If i cant go to work, i lose my house. Or maybe i should sell the house so i can get snowtires?  Ill do the best i can with what i have. If that means leaving 1/2hr earlier so be it. But until i can afford get some, i shouldnt be put under the umbrella of idiot or cheapskate. For that matter, neither should anyone else. And if i happen to see someone having a tough go, i wont hesitate to stop and help. Whether they have winter tires or slicks."
750754,Squid,2012-12-10 17:38:00,1656,  Sarcasm? On the period? Wow you are a class act all the wasy EC.
750755,Squid,2012-12-10 17:41:00,1656,Now open your boxes and look outside. Ever consider what happens when a reckless driver finds new confindence in his abilities to drive in the winter because he has snows on??? I'd rather be behind and excellent driver driving to conditions with all seasons than a reckless jerk with snows on.
750756,Squid,2012-12-10 17:42:00,1656,  Totally agree Chris.
750486,darsky,2012-12-09 20:07:00,586,In La Belle Province its the law that you must have installed winters by Dec 15. I squeeked em on today with a sucky forecast. Many call this law a bigtime money grab for the tire industry and others. I for one think the opposite. Winter tires mean less accidents-which means less insurance claims which could lower premiums. I drive better with winters and have more confidence.I think there is no such law in Ontario although maybe there should be one.
750488,Sinker,2012-12-09 20:10:00,8692,"Im all for snow tires in the winter! I drive an all wheel drive vehicle, and still swear by dedicated snows. There is a HUGE difference!!  S."
750490,misfish,2012-12-09 20:18:00,29133,"When I had the truck,I always had mud/snows on, 12 months of the year. Now that I am a car driver,I went with a directional tread. Very impressed with them. The mrs,s also runs a winter tire. I have seen guys put just snows on the front. it dosent work. You need all 4 to match up.Yer ass end will slide out of control.Theres a reason tire dealers will not put just 2 tires on."
750492,kickingfrog,2012-12-09 20:19:00,8333,The difference between winters and all seasons is huge. The costs are mitigated a bit by extending the life of tires by not having them on your vehicle for 3-4 months a year. In the end what is your and your families safety really worth? Eight hundred to twelve hundred over 4-5 winters is cheap peace of mind.  I'll take a front wheel drive car with winter tires over an all wheel drive with all seasons.
750495,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-09 20:23:00,10439,I'm all for proper snow tires as well. Even before I moved North I always ran 4 snows on my cars back in Ontario. For 12 years I drove Honda Civics to get back and forth to work and I had much better traction than with the stock all seasons. In fact the stock all seasons were downright dangerous as soon as there was as little as 1cm of snow on the road.  I didn't buy expensive snows either as I drove so many miles that they were replaced every 2 years. The snows I ran were Coopers that were priced at around $70 a piece.  The last year I owned my last Civic I was on vacation in Alaska in the fall and ran into some serious snow in the mountains. I had to pull in for gas in the middle of nowhere. The lot was unplowed and there was over a foot of snow on the ground. I filled up and went inside to pay (inside the local bar) and the locals looked at me like I had three heads!!! LOL I paid and walked out the door and I can just imagine that all the locals inside were betting on me being stuck as I was plowing quite a bit of snow on my way in. I hopped in started the beast up and drove away as if there was no snow at all.  Would have loved to see the looks on the locals faces as I left the station.
750498,Fisherman,2012-12-09 20:25:00,7201,"Big time, I think it should become mandated.  All season tires are for places where the likely hood of winter conditions are rare."
750500,misfish,2012-12-09 20:26:00,29133,"Rob,I spent $1200 for rims and tires.It blew me away,but after thinking,they will last me 4 years or more,as they are for what,4 months of the year. My low profiles,will last just as long."
750501,Old Man,2012-12-09 20:35:00,822,My winter tires go on the middle of November and come off mid April. Wouldn't operate a vehicle in this part of the country with out them.
750504,misfish,2012-12-09 20:38:00,29133, LOL Dave  I ran Coopers on my truck. 375 a piece.  Good soft tire tread.
750506,lew,2012-12-09 20:40:00,12766,"I'm another one that always uses dedicated winter tires and rims.  There's nothing worse than having your vehicle all set up for winter driving and then being stuck in traffic behind  guys who are too cheap to properly equip their own vehicle for the nasty weather and are slipping & sliding on their all seasons.  The problem  with making winter tires mandatory though, is lotsa folks just leave the car in the garage when the roads are bad and only bring it back out when things clear up.  When my folks got up in years and it wasn't necessary for them to go out on nasty days they just stayed home and waited till things were cleaned up.  Winter tires/wheels are expensive and it's tough to force them on folks who don't drive when conditions are bad...at least that's the way I look at it."
750507,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-09 20:46:00,10439, Yours might have been a bit bigger than the ones on my little Honda.
750509,SlowPoke,2012-12-09 20:48:00,2984,"I'm all in favour of MY government having NO SAY in what tires I choose to have on MY car.  Give consideration to those that are able to choose when to drive or avoid the conditions. To those that may only drive a handful of kilometers a week. And to those that have a choice of vehicles to drive when the conditions are appropriate.  Do I recommend snow tires? Absolutely, to those that have no choice but to drive in adverse conditions. (sub-zero/snow/ice)  My wife's Elantra gets snows tomorrow and my Ram, Suburban and Volvo will go without."
750510,Spiel,2012-12-09 20:53:00,9065,Last week I had the winters tires (all four) put on both my daughters vehicles as always. Worth their weight in gold in my opinion.
750517,lew,2012-12-09 21:11:00,12766,"Two years ago we were having a group of friends over for an evening and 8"" of snow fell that day. I'm a mile and a half down at the end of a dirt road and my bud was driving a 4x4 Jeep with winter tires and he couldn't make it thru the snow and I had to go out and get him.  A lady friend of ours had all seasons on and made it thru the snow with just a little trouble.  It's good to be properly equipped for winter driving, but you also have to know how to drive."

750558,G.mech,2012-12-09 23:36:00,830,    EXACTLY!!  Amen to that brother!!!
750560,BillM,2012-12-09 23:38:00,17367, This man knows what he's talking about.. Even the cheapest winters are better then the best all seasons when the snow hits.
750564,glen,2012-12-09 23:44:00,2641,If you do low KM per year (12k or less) the Hankook optimo 4S are good.  They are winter rated but you can drive on them year round.  No tire changing and no getting caught without the winter tires on.
750565,irishfield,2012-12-09 23:44:00,26272,"Not sure what I'm missing guys, but it probably wouldn't be the first time. I get nailed with more snow than most here do, sitting on the high ridge (180 feet) above wide open Georgian Bay and the first to ""catch a cloud"" and get dumped on with snow. We can have mornings with a foot to 18"" of snow, when even Midland has barely received a dusting. I run the all terains that come on the truck from the mfg. Have had a total of 7 or 8 different sets and vehicles since being on this property, with a 1400 foot laneway to get to the house from the generally unplowed concession road. I've never been stuck.....  I even plow said laneway with a 7'6 blade and a truck with all terrains on it!  Now with a lighter car... my Tbird SC wouldn't move with regular tires on it, it received a set of Mud and Snows every fall. Son same deal with his light little Ford Focus.  ... and what Brian said! We're getting close to communism as it is, we don't need more shoved down our throats. Can't believe Quebec bent over so quick on the issue."
750622,darsky,2012-12-10 02:38:00,586,"  It's been only 2 years since the law was implemented and the difference in accident #'s have been staggering. That's good enough for me.  Quebec implemented the "" no holding the cell phone in the car "" law and Ontario followed suit. Just wait-it'll come."
750627,dhickey,2012-12-10 02:59:00,1038,I look at it this way. The average price for winter tires is about 800 insalled on a car 1200 on a truck. 2 sets of tires should last about 6 yrs for winter 4-5 for all season tires. During the winter it only takes 1 trip into the ditch to justify the cost of snow tires. Lost time from work 2-4 bills/towing150-300 bills not to mention repair cost 4-1000 depending on deductable.  cost min 750 bills  Winter tires work and save you money.  Not to mention you probably wont end up in the ditch if you have snows...
750630,irishfield,2012-12-10 03:17:00,26272,"No arguement Darsky... just speaking out loud. Never been in a ditch in my life.. have always got home.. motored up to Tremblant from Montreal thru 16"" of snow that hadn't been plowed. Use to do the back way in from Hull on that windy road.. (yah I know.. just jinxed myself).. but maybe growing up in the Ottawa Valley and always making it to ski hills BEFORE the roads were plowed or the lifts had even been started taught me how to drive in the winter!   (and that was with cars that my old man didn't even know what an ""all season"" tire was!)"
750631,cram,2012-12-10 03:26:00,1733,Dedicated snows are definitely better but the gov has no business mandating them.
