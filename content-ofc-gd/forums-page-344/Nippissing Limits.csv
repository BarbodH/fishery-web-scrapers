""It was also clear from the review that maintaining current harvest levels would further threaten the population."" So angler harvest level is cut in half and the other folks ""harvesting"" have only agreed to moritorium on the spring netting. And that is again, only the folks who they have any actual control over.  On a related note, I would suggest that Lake Nip locals plan on eating a lot of fillets in the next week or so, as anything in your freezer after Jan 1, could land you in pretty hot water!! HH"

752873,JimC,2012-12-18 12:09:00,86,"    First wanted to thank Nipfisher for his detailed reply (last post on Page-8) ... it appears we see this the same way;  however, based on what I've re quoted here from 'fishindevel' and 'Andy',  and the fact they seem very sure of their interpretation, then we could not take (legally) take 3 or 4 walleye home, at week's end  I'm so ticked off right now, on so many levels!     Our group that has been spending big money each spring for the last 15 yrs, at a lodge on Lake Nipissing have always respected the limits, and the slot, to the extent that if a measurement at either end was even half way close, back it went.  We did this even in those seasons where we were having a tough time scraping a meal together.   We drive 1000 miles, spend big bucks supporting the local economy, and now another blow to my / our personal freedom.   The max 4 fish to take home (which rarely happened btw), from our one trip/yr vacation,  does no harm to the overall fishery, especially when compared to the story Andy tells here, and what I know many, but not all, ""locals"" do via their daily harvesting!  hey, its easy when you live only minutes from the lake.  I used to live in North Bay, so I've seen it happen.  The last thing I'll say is that I think the way Nipfisher is interpreting the new rules is the Correct version, and that is what our group will be following. This year,  I think we will involve the lodge owner, show them our daily catch, document the heck out of everything, and if we are lucky enough to have four Walleye at week's end to take home, so be it.   We will take our chances, and have a clear conscience doing so.   We will respect the new daily catch, and the slot as we always do,  but ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!  I've had it!"
752895,dickie,2012-12-18 14:17:00,64,Wow. looks like each of my family members will get a feed of pickeral once in 6 years if I go up once a year totake home 2 pickeral. And don't tell me to buy them in the store either.
752896,BillM,2012-12-18 14:22:00,17367," This might be silly, but there are a lot of other lakes other then Nipissing that have walters.  Some of you guys are making it sound like it's the end of the world."
752897,Nipfisher,2012-12-18 14:25:00,2449," Jim C,  I looked at the regs and it clearly states that posession limit is the same as daily catch limit. Not sure why I thought different but, like you, I dont see ""stockpiling"" as wrong. Now I am talking ""me"" accumulating 4-6 walleye ""on my own"" over a week/month period. I am not talking 20-30 walleye in the freezer.  I will definately keep more perch this year and eat a few walleye in my hut or release them.  If ice-fishing Nipissing becomes too much of a hassle I may switch lakes for next winter."

752907,cisco,2012-12-18 14:53:00,597,"I read some time ago how the OMNR has its hands tied re the native harvest issue since the Feds are in charge of anything o do with this. But if harvest practices become a 'threat to conservation' or whatever words were used in what I read, then MNR can get authority to get involved. Non-native harvest leagally speaking takes a back seat to native harvest, so by reducing non-native limits this supports the argument that things are becoming a 'threat to conservation"". Not sure if the non-native harvest has to be completely eliminated and whether the Nippissing walleye population has to be virtually wiped out before the Feds allow MNR to intervene, but looks like the direction things are headed.  Smelt population increase for sure will get walleye off bottom so harder for traditional angling methods to connect. But I bet the gov't lawyers have already come up with the 'line' which walleye pop'n levels need be reduced to before they feel they can successfully seek Fed approval re intervention. My $.02 on it anyways. Bash away!"

Few years later ... no more walleyes.. just the   suckers... then nobody went sucker fishing much any more....  I started guiding full time around 1965... We'd go out in the spring...

753168,JimC,2012-12-19 13:18:00,86," yeah, I know ... it's going to be a total of only TWO Walleye per S-2 License in anyone's freezer at any point in time. I'm just frustrated that the Minister in charge is ignoring action on, what I, and others are convinced would improve the situation significantly, rather than just attack the casual angler, and make life even more miserable for honest small business folks, running their lodges, and trying to keep their heads above water in tough economic times. What I want to see positive action on are: 1. A Coordinated well managed, Mass Restocking Program to boost the Walleye population over time.  It's how the Yellow Pickerel (ie Walleye) got into the Lake in the first place, and it sure worked then, so why not Now?!  2. A major cull of double-breasted Cormorants;  Thousands upon thousands of these huge sea-going birds have infiltrated Lake Nipissing in recent years.  I've watched them hunt;  I believe they can eat their body weight in fish daily (correct me if I'm wrong);  it does not surprise me at the large estimates of fish weight removed by this invasive species from the eco-system.   Whether they are eating a 12"" Walleye, or a small Perch, that removes feed from other game fish, the devastation continues.   The only reason I can think of that this issue remains, is that the powers-to-be don't have what it takes to absorb a bit of flak from the activist lobby groups that hold all animal life sacred.  You know who they are.  I am not going to go on about the NFN commercial fishery.  I believe if 1. and 2.  happened, and there was NFN participation, as there should be,  we would all benefit, as would future generations.    C'mon Minister in charge ... let's get serious and do something positive ... for once in your mandate!"
753171,woodenboater,2012-12-19 13:35:00,2277,One would think targeting the cormorant issue would be the least politically expensive option. I don't think there's much love anywhere for this bird so it would be a win win situation imo. Everything looks barren where ever they reside.
753217,doubleheader,2012-12-19 17:01:00,497,"Guess we're very fortunate on my home water, the best of which is all on Seneca Nations land. While they have exempt status as it pertains to regs, non-indians must purchase a Nations License ($35) which goes towards enforcement of regs and improved habitat. Additionally the Nations have built a walleye hatchery and are partnering with other state agencies to improve the lake. In the interest of full disclosure I must say the hatchery was funded by a federal grant, however the result is they are partnering if not leading efforts to improve the fishery. I'm told there was no netting last year, I know I never saw any nets. Limits were reduced to 4 fish/day, only 1/day over 21"" on nations waters. A good step. It just made me wonder if some similar arrangement might work on Nipissing wherein hatchery/habitat improvement jobs, including knocking down the Cormorant population, might replace commercial harvesting jobs. One thing is for sure, all parties have a stake in the future of Nipissing as surely commercial fishing on the lake is not going to be a viable occupation in the near future without some major changes."
753256,dickie,2012-12-19 20:57:00,64,The natives on our lake have promises to set up a hatchery but haven't come thru yet. At the monenttaking them out is more profitable than puting any back in.
753288,LNSA Join Us,2012-12-19 23:31:00,7,"I have had many discussions regarding the merits of restocking.  The greatest concern being the impact the commercial fishery would have on the stocked population. Below is the reader digest version of the Red Lake story from Minnesota.  The Walleye fishery was destroyed by both fisheries.  The conditions were so bad the black crappie population exploded.  Keep in mind there is a gill net commercial fishery and sports fishery on that lake today.  Restocking can work if all groups contribute.  There were three major stockings done for restoration purposes into the Red Lakes. The initial stocking in 1999 was approximately 42 million fry, with 31 million in 2001, and 32 million in 2003. Eggs were obtained by MN DNR from the Pike River run from Lake Vermilion. Eggs were incubated, hatched, and marked at a DNR hatchery near Bemidji. The Red Lake DNR assisted with marking and distribution of fry to Red Lake. Estimated costs for egg collection, hatchery and administrative costs were approximately $68,000 per stocking event. The Red Lake Band and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, reimbursed the MNDNR $40,000 per stocking event. All three of these stocking events were exceptionally successful. I am certain that the restoration cost to MN anglers will be very quickly recovered in angling opportunity and economic return from the incredible fishery that has developed. In addition to the restoration stocking, there were two smaller evaluation stocking events in 2004 and 2005 using 4-7 million fry. Though full scale stocking was no longer necessary it was important to have some marked fry in the system to be able to estimate wild fry production and recovery progress. This proved valuable by documenting exceptional wild fry production from our restored brood stock in excess of our earlier stocking efforts. Eggs for the evaluation stockings were collected directly from the Blackduck River tributary to the Red Lakes by the Red Lake DNR and incubated and marked in the MNDNR hatchery. Since the Band did the egg collection and the State did the incubation, no reimbursement was exchanged for these collaborative efforts. It should be noted that besides the actual costs and monetary reimbursements there has been considerable collaboration on all aspects of this recovery effort, of which egg collection and fry stocking has been just one part of a much larger process. Thank you for your interest and feel free to contact me with any further questions. Gary  Gary Barnard Bemidji Area Fisheries Supervisor"
753317,JimC,2012-12-20 02:36:00,86,"reading 'headhunter' and 'LNSA' ... funny how Great things happen when ALL the stakeholders come together in a cooperative effort.   The dollar investment mentioned ($68K) is not chump change, but geez, I spent that much myself at ONE lodge, bring my family, and fishing buddies there, over the years we've been enjoying Lake Nipissing.  It's a multi-million dollar industry and definitely worth saving, for our kids and grandkids to enjoy, as we have.  Please keep the pressure on the 'MNR' and Minister in charge to sanction a vibrant, full blown, Walleye restocking program,  and a major cull of the invasive Cormorants.

Essentially, it is outlining what we have already been told here by some of the various stake holders. They have completely begged off anything to do with Native based issues, not there jurisdiction. Here's a quote... ""Walleye between 40 and 60 centimetres must still be released as is currently required. This ""slot"" size continues to protect spawning sized walleye. However, stocking Walleye is not enough to bring about the recovery of the Walleye population in Lake Nipissing. We need to address the mortality rate of young Walleye. Reducing the catch limit is a positive first step towards walleye population recovery, but other management actions will be required. The changes are a good starting point for the development of a comprehensive Lake Nipissing fisheries management planning process that will explore developing objectives and management tactics for the Lake. The reduction in daily catch limits is just one part of a broader long term strategy for Lake Nipissing. In addition to developing a long-term management plan for Lake Nipissing, other management actions we are currently considering include exploration of additional angling opportunities for other species (eg yellow perch) and community based stocking. The Ministry of Natural Resources is also continuing a dialogue with local First Nations regarding the commercial fishery. At the same time, the Ontario government respects that Nipissing First Nation members have a treaty right to fish commercially on Lake Nipissing, as legally determined in the 1990 R.v. Commanda case.""  I wonder if the treaty allows them to empty the lake? Also, it seems that the MNR want us to fish for perch. I wonder how long before we see a commercial perch harvest, if there isn't one already? Anyway, there it is... HH"
753433,Billy Bob,2012-12-20 18:23:00,5865,"IMHO your spinning your wheels trying to manage a lake for sport fishing all the while it can be commercially netted....HOWEVER, perch are the #1 enemy to walleye fry...the more perch you have the lower chance ANY (natural or stocked) walleye fry have to grow large enough to spawn or be caught by anyone. Oneida Lake has seen a steady fluctuation of walleye depending on how large the perch population is...LOTS of perch mean a smaller percentage of walleye make it past the fry stage."

It has been a struggle to get people to attend meetings or join the organization but I would have to agree, we get what we deserve.  If we don't stand up against our government when they make poor decisions then we have lost. Someone mentioned that reducing the take limit from 6 to 4 and introducing the slot size didn't work.  If you believe the data that the MNR has released, then those reg. changes did have a positive impact on the Walleye population.

752647,JimC,2012-12-17 20:51:00,86," thanks for the reply, Randy ... maybe I just don't understand your answer to my question?   Sorry.  So let me try this again.  A buddy and I book into a lodge for one week. We each catch TWO Walleye, under the slot on Monday, against our S-2 licenses.   No problem so far under the new rules. Filet and freeze them cuz we got chile thawed out we need to eat.  Can we keep One or Two more each on Tuesday, or must we first consume the fish caught Monday (2 each)?  If I catch and keep One poor scrawny 13"" - 14"" Walleye on each of Tues, Wed, Thurs, and Friday, freeze them, and want to take the four of them back home, so my wife and I can have one or two small meals of Walleye, over the winter, is that a violation? in this scenario, I only kept one per day, but wish to bring my POSSESSION LIMIT OF FOUR,  home to share.  Am I good to go?  If I am in violation, in this scenario, then the law is badly flawed.  A good law needs to make sense and be enforceable.  I would wager you would be hard pressed to find very many, if any, locals who target Walleye regularly,  and have only TWO Walleye (per valid S-2 license) in their possession,  i.e. at home in the Freezer, during the height of fishing season.  Anyone out there doubt that?  So is it Daily Catch Limit of Two per S-2 license;  Total Possession (at home, or returning home from vacation) limit Four (or Two). Again, I understand there is plenty of precedent for Daily Catch = 2;   Total Possesion (in context above) = 4.  Sorry to run on but wanted to be crystal clear what my question is;  the answer is important, because it could end up being the proverbial ""straw that broke the camel's back""  as far as our annual spring fishing trip goes.   There have been many years our lack of success meant we had zero Walleye to bring home to the family for a taste;  however, when conditions were right, and we had some luck, and we are dropping $2,000-3,000 into the community, I like to think I am not a criminal if I bring Four small Walleye home with me.   ok, I'm done now."

752661,moxie,2012-12-17 21:43:00,1566," Ontarians forget everything Roy. All it takes is a few promises to get them over the hump and once the ballots are counted, WHAM!!!!!!! Confusius say: He who make false promise, not need honor it."
752662,dickie,2012-12-17 21:48:00,64,"If I as a lone fisherman who has a wife and 4 children, go out 6 consecutive days, take home the fish,clean and freeze them, and on the seventh day eat them with my family, am I doing this legal or not?"
752663,dickie,2012-12-17 21:53:00,64,They call it a lame duck parliament so I guess any laws the mnr pass now has to go thru parliament to be ratified. So until the parliament session resumes sometime in the new year we can still catch 4 walleye. Any lawyer want to respond?
752667,Roy,2012-12-17 22:02:00,13728,The regulations in most Ontario waters including Nipissing are that your possession limit is a one day catch limit.
752672,Roy,2012-12-17 22:08:00,13728," You don't need a lawyer for that. When you purchase your 2013 fishing license, you will be given a copy of the regulations for you to adhere to. It's also your responsibility to keep yourself informed as to any regulation changes during the season for which that license was issued."
752675,dickie,2012-12-17 22:16:00,64,The mnr has a mandate  to issue new licences every year. Any changes to the law has to be ratified by the minister of fisheries. Until then it is not law.
752691,irishfield,2012-12-17 22:38:00,26272,AFAIK Regulations don't need to go through parliment.. they only need to be signed off by the minister responsible and put thru the Gazette TWICE to become law. First time through the public can question it / public consultation in an attempt to stall or change it.  Second time it's etched in stone.
752707,Muskieman,2012-12-17 23:25:00,2472,"I would imagine if someone ratted you out , and the MNR decided to a DNA test on your Walleye , if they are deemed Nipissing Walleye , then your ( at home ) possession limit , would be 2 fish per angler... I can see this becoming a problem , considering that Nipissing  is the only lake that has a 2 Walleye limit and is surrounded by 4 Walleye limit lakes , enforcement is gonna have fun trying to figure it out on a roadside spot check ."
752722,dickie,2012-12-17 23:47:00,64,"I thought  if you are less than 18 yrs old you don't need a licence, so I would be legal to have 2 walleye in my freezer for each of my 4 children. Wife not included.They would have to prove that my children did not catch them. Am I right?"
752728,Muskieman,2012-12-17 23:55:00,2472,"No sorry , I mean ( eligible ) for a license ... Even your ( my ) kids or seniors or ODSP( wheelchair pass) have to follow the regs .. ( my French is ON tonight , tired , I'm not coming across like I want ) sorry ..."
752729,Muskieman,2012-12-17 23:56:00,2472,  Agree .
752736,fishindevil,2012-12-18 00:07:00,6254,Your catch limit is always your possession limit !!!! If your limit is 2 walleyes you are not allowed to keep anymore walleyes till those fish are consumed !!!! You cannot stockpile fish and count them as its ok to catch 2 more tommorow and 2 the next !! You can only do that if you eat your limit everyday then you can go back out and catch your limit again!! That's the way it works for whatever area or if you are in an area whith special regs or slots
752749,Muskieman,2012-12-18 00:26:00,2472," Right , but filling someone else's limit is also illegal , could fall under the "" party fishing"" law ... By that law all anglers must be able to identify ( their ) own catch ... stock piling is definitely a big problem all over the province , it also contributes to the depletion. ."
752750,Muskieman,2012-12-18 00:26:00,2472,10 ....9 .....
752753,Andy,2012-12-18 00:27:00,330," It is as simple as that, yet I know a number of long time anglers that I've had to point that you can't stockpile fish. I'm sure that they keep doing it.  As for as fixing the problem, all involved parties are guilty to varying degrees. I was talking to a co-worker who had a native friend in his group of four on Nipissing last year. They each took home a cooler full of fish. I pointed out it out to him that he well exceeded his limit. He said that the group kept all they wanted because the native friend had told them that if they were checked by a CO he would simply say all the fish were his. I asked my coworker if he was OK with that.  My coworker's justification was that they don't take home their limit every trip. (He considers his limit being 4 fish a day times the # of days at the camp!) Gee, I wonder why there is a problem. Disappointing to say the least."
752146,JimC,2012-12-16 02:14:00,86,"As a long time, loyal supporter of Lake Nipissing Tourism,  through my 30+ years of renting a cabin and boat n motor at an established, family oriented, Lodge ... I was shocked to see this knee-jerk reaction by the MNR, on this important and sensitive subject.  I would be ok with this latest quota reduction,  IF the Stakeholders ideas of 'significant restocking efforts',  and 'Cormorant culling' had also been embraced with equal enthusiasm, by the MNR and the Hon Michael Gravelle, MPP, Minister in charge; however, the (apparent) total lack of a response by the Minister to those who are acting as good Stewards of the lake makes me wonder if this is just incompetence, or also political, given the loss to (PC) Vic Fedeli, in the last Ont. election?  Hopefully not (political), but it sure makes ya go 'hmmmmmmm ... '  I hate the idea of gill netting, spearing in spawning beds, and so on as practised legally (or not) by NFN;  however, given the world we live in, I feel that this is the reality,  and it is better to take the high road and partner with like minded members of NFN who truly do care about the future Lake Nipissing Walleye fishery, in such a way that the renegades, WHO IGNORE THE RULES AND QUOTAS, will be shunned in their own community, and the community at large,  and diminish in numbers over time.  Of course there is no quick fix to declining Walleye stocks, but if we take the positive approach,  write to the Hon. Minister (as hopeless as it may seem), letters to the editor,  blogs, forums, whatever, hopefully, good things will eventually happen?  or maybe I'm just being naive again?   Lets Go Fishing!!"
752169,Muskieman,2012-12-16 04:43:00,2472,"Happy to see that this thread has remained civilized and unlocked ...good on you all. Hoping that Vic's letter will help ... But probably won't ... the decision made is an educated one ... based on studies and surveys , it's a preventative measure that is needed right now ... More info to come ..."
752201,Rockview,2012-12-16 14:05:00,6,"  Sorry Randy but that's the problem the decision they made was a political one made based on the perception that it would help not it's effectiveness. The MNR's studies and surveys don't support this management action but it is the easiest decision - financially and politically.  From http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fisheries/management/myths.html  “On any given day, 95 percent of walleye anglers harvest two or fewer walleyes. This generally holds true on every walleye lake in Minnesota and across the U.S.”  I’m extrapolating this to Ontario but I suspect that it holds true – an informal survey of other resort owners in the area supports it. If this is even close to correct for Ontario/Lake Nipissing then a reduction from 4 to 2 Walleye on Lake Nipissing will make almost no difference. It’s clear that the MNR is making this change only for the sake of perception. The MNR has admitted in meetings with us that reducing the catch limit on Lake Nipissing would have NO effect on reducing the overall number of Walleye caught."
752204,bigugli,2012-12-16 14:14:00,6138,"THere are 5 courses of  action, and all need some degree of implementation. The MNR simply chose the option with the least financial and political cost to the government."
752212,LNSA Join Us,2012-12-16 14:33:00,7,"  I have to agree with Rockview.  The data presented by the MNR indicated no positive impact on the Walleye fishery by reducing the take limits.  They did present ideas that their Biologist believed would have a positive impact but did not select them.  Struggling to understand why.   I am all for conservation, being a part of a sustainalble fishery but I think the MNR is so underfunded that the organization is broken.  We believe that restocking, although not the an swer on its own, will allow time for everyone to sit at the same table and work on a long term solution. I would like my kids to be able to enjoy Nipissing as I have."
752219,Nipfisher,2012-12-16 14:50:00,2449,"  Me too, but looks like they may be targeting pike, perch, bass, and musky.   This was a pretty good year for walleye on the lake but at this pace (without successful re-stocking) it won't last long. Alot of those 14-15.5"" fish will be net size and without a healthy adult population there will be fewer small ones."
752226,moxie,2012-12-16 15:16:00,1566," BINGO!!!. These measures are implemented when stocks are dwindling and unable to sustain themselves aren't they?  As long as there are certain groups who are given special dispensation its only a band aid and only until political will (Pipe Dream) is demonstrated to make the necessary changes to benefit all involved is there a chance to remedy these issues. How about we lobby the government to raise licencing fees to, lets say, $??? Just another colossal Governmental failure. At least they're consistent."
752230,capt_hooked,2012-12-16 15:28:00,212,It's ALL the MNR's fault...!  Before the 1920s there were no yellow walleyes in Lake Nipissing....  Then the MNR had to go and release millions of walleye fry.. and there went the neighbourhood...!   And now look at the mess we have to deal with...!    sheesh...!!!        
752232,glen,2012-12-16 15:38:00,2641,So you are telling me the gillnets are put out for a fish that was not even there before the 1920s. Why are people aloud to gillnet walleye then?
752237,Muskieman,2012-12-16 15:46:00,2472,"At one time Nip was in worse shape than it is now ..it would be nice to have a lake full of Blues though , like about 100 years ago . History is repeating itself. ."
752238,Roy,2012-12-16 15:47:00,13728," I find your choice of words ironic and perhaps even a little unfortunate.  Sorry, back to our regularly scheduled programming."
752251,LNSA Join Us,2012-12-16 16:08:00,7,"  It was a great year for Walleye fishing apparently there are three strong year classes in the lake and what surprised everyone is the MNR announced that this years FWIN indicated another strong year class.  When we asked where did these fish come from if the adult population is so low, the MNR answered, we have no idea. If every year we ensure a strong year class, then sports fishing will be good."
752258,Nipfisher,2012-12-16 16:15:00,2449,"  Glen, take this as you like but having talked with many native netters here on Nipissing, there choice fish to net is White Fish.  The recieve $x per walleye but $x per pound for White fish. So a 5 lbs. White fish pays the same as 4-5 walleye. Now....the Whities are down 25-40 feet in this lake so they are difficult to net. The walleye cruising in 8-15 fow are much easier to target."
752259,Nipfisher,2012-12-16 16:17:00,2449,"LNSA, Rockview Cottages, Captain, and Randy I REALLY appreciate your comments and efforts."
752260,Billy Bob,2012-12-16 16:20:00,5865, This is a very good point I never thought of...how can it be a native Canadian tradition if there were no walleyes in the prior to the 1920's....  ...if this is true.
752270,Muskieman,2012-12-16 16:33:00,2472,"There were Walleye in Nip  they were the now Extinct Blue Walleye... She was fished out , worse shape than today, the Yellow Walleye is the specie selected to replace the depleted Blues ."
752272,Billy Bob,2012-12-16 16:39:00,5865," Those are two completely different fish but related.....Lake Erie also had what were referred to as ""BLUE PIKE"" in the Buffalo area...a smaller and tastier fish compared to the ""YELLOW PIKE"" or better known as our WALLEYE...and your Pickerel...So this is basically like comparing a northern pike to a chained pickerel...both kind of look alike...the chain pickerel rarely grows past 5 lbs...and again both are completely different fish but also related."
752275,Headhunter,2012-12-16 16:48:00,5703,"Exactly my point Randy. We seen this before and it happened for the same reasons. I fear that we will not have learned anything from the past and that greed will again, destroy the lake for an entire generation. HH"
752314,LNSA Join Us,2012-12-16 18:28:00,7,"  Prior to 1920 the Blue Sauger was the most common fish in Lake Nipissing. Apparently it is a smaller member of the Walleye family. (Looks almost identical but is blue in colour). If you want to understand why the Natives can commercial fish, you need to read cases from the Supreme Court of Canada, (Glandstone, Commanda and Sparrow are just three).  The MNR's hands have been tied as far as I can tell. Very difficult problem and hard to aurgue when people say that restocking is only a bandair solution.  The depth of the political issues are beyond our small group and there is no point throughing up your hands and saying nothing will change, we intend to continue trying."
752330,spinnerbaitking,2012-12-16 19:17:00,1622," Seems fitting to put this here too. I'm not an expert but the people making the decision likely aren't either, take a look at the Saugeen River, different fish & everything but the Stocking done by the Lake Huron Fishing Club & the Ontario Steelheaders have made that an amazing fisheries, so I would think if the stocking is done with the right size of Walleye & the habitat is there it shouldn't hurt & it surely could help, doing nothing definitely won't, people need to jump on board by joining these club to give them any & all the help they need, Numbers talk so lets make these groups bigger so the MNR have to listen to us, could be time to crap or get off the pot. Just My .02 worth SBK  PS: Pay & you have a right to your say don't & nobody is going to listen to a small Group"
752350,Bernie,2012-12-16 20:17:00,3190,"Concessions have been made over the past few years. Reduction from 6 to 4. Didn't help. Slot size introduced. Didn't help. Restocking programs, still the numbers are less. Now the limit reduced to 2. Think it will help?  It's time other options are presented. You all know what they are."
752353,sandybay,2012-12-16 20:33:00,64,Here is a question that I have heard a few times. Can the MNR change the regulations without a sitting Parliament? What I'm saying are the new limits valid?
752357,Roy,2012-12-16 20:45:00,13728, I'm sure they can but they might not want to exercise that option if keeping their jobs is important to them.
752360,kickingfrog,2012-12-16 20:51:00,8333,"This article was discussed here almost 3 years ago, but didn't notice if someone else had brought up this aspect of the fishery.  http://www.nugget.ca/2010/02/05/somethings-fishy-on-nipissing-photo-gallery   Something's fishy on Nipissing  By DAVE DALE, The Nugget Saturday, February 6, 2010 10:37:12 EST AM  Lake Nipissing walleye may have become hooked on a fat-rich diet of smelts, a theory that explains a disappearing act this past fall, as well as ice fishing complaints and a recent explosion in the perch population.  Richard Rowe, Nipissing First Nation biologist, told The Nugget Thursday that ""lower-than-expected catches of all size classes of walleye"" were found in the annual netting survey.  Rowe said the fall walleye index netting results conflict with harvest success - the commercial quota was reached early - and the upward trend of spawning fish documented over the past five years despite similar pressure.  ""The 2009 FWIN results are puzzling,"" he said, explaining how the results from the past 12 years made sense when compared to harvest data and estimates for both natives and non-natives.  ""This year is a bit of an anomaly,"" he said, suggesting it serves as a ""wake-up"" call for an expanded study.  ""It's not uncommon to have the odd 'off year' in a long term data set. Having said that, we cannot take that chance . . . The 2009 results cannot be ignored by managers.""  Rowe recommends a detailed study involving a partnership of stakeholders to test his ""ecosystem change"" theory, combined with an independent trap netting exercise in the spring to validate or add to the FWIN results.  He said the annual FWIN study documents other species at the same time, ""showing perch numbers trending way up, with herring trending down.""  Native harvesters, Rowe said, are reporting many more smelt in the lake and they are forming a significant part of the walleye diet.  ""These trends in perch and herring, as well as what anglers are saying about walleye not biting, (combined with) a recent increase in walleye growth rate, are all consistent with an increase in smelt,"" he said.  ""Walleye on a smelt diet could potentially change their activity patterns making them much less active, which could partially explain low FWIN catches as CONTINUED FROM A1  well,"" he said.  ""There also appear to be changes at the zooplankton level of the food web, which, if confirmed, may be the mechanism for an increase in smelt, among other things,"" Rowe said.  ""It's all circumstantial evidence, but it's really starting to pile up for some type of ecosystem change.""  The Nugget's inquiry about the FWIN results came before Rowe finalized the results and held a data-sharing meeting with North Bay District Ministry of Natural Resources staff and other parties.  Rowe said he intends to discuss the issue with the Lake Nipissing Stewardship Council later this month.  Phil Hall, acting district supervisor, confirmed the MNR biologist involved with Lake Nipissing is on parental leave and a replacement hasn't been named.  Hall also said winter creel data is still being collected by staff during the week and a contract worker every weekend.  But Hall, speaking as a private citizen who fishes every winter with an ice hut off Deepwater Point along the south shore of Lake Nipissing, said his experience coincides with what many people are saying.  ""We're not getting too many walleye and the perch are way, way up,"" he said, adding that everybody also says ""the walleye fishing was great this summer.""  Bill Richards of Billy Bob's Bait at Lakeshore and Pinewood Park drives said he thinks the lake is in ""excellent shape"" because walleye fishing is ""great in the spring and great in the summer.""  Those who fish successfully in winter, Richards said, are not sitting in their huts on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.  He said many of his customers who fish early in the morning and early evening are pulling up one to three walleye and about a dozen perch each time out.  If anything, Richards said, people are getting frustrated catching too many ""slot-size"" fish 40 to 60 centimetres long. Walleye this size are considered prime spawners and must be released back into the water.  His son called him from the lake recently via cellphone, Richards said, asking what to do with a 70-cm walleye.  When told to release it, he said his son refused, saying, ""I just threw the last six back.""  Carl D'Amour, a retired MNR conservation officer and part owner of Grump and Grumpy's ice fishing bungalows, said Rowe's smelt theory isn't far fetched.  D'Amour said smelts hang out in large schools suspended well above the floor of the lake.  Lake Nipissing ice fishermen commonly bounce their jigs off the bottom.  Josh Savoie, Ben Laplante and Patrick Corriveau were heading out to ""Perch City"" Thursday afternoon, a collection of ice huts east of the Manitou Islands.  Savoie said they've been catching tasty perch steadily for weeks, but only caught two walleye.  Laplante, however, caught an 11-pound ling, a species of freshwater cod that is making a comeback in Lake Nipissing.  Corriveau, a seasonal construction worker laid off for the winter, said he get as much fishing in as possible before he gets too busy in the summer.  ""I enjoy the outdoors, even if I don't catch anything all day,"" he said, with Laplante saying they caught 80 perch the other day, including 35 keepers for a fish-fry that night.  ""It was good eating.""  [email protected]"
752363,Bernie,2012-12-16 21:11:00,3190,"When I was a kid growing up through the 60's and 70's all the tourist camps were full of fishermen on the South Bay. Nipissing lodge, Tom Rae Lodge, Promised Land Camps, Pipers camp, Rockview, plus the ones around the corner from me, Sunlit Bay, Bear Creek Cottages. You often had difficulty navigating across the bays for boats. They caught fish. Now, there is a bit of a rush opening weekend, but after that, it's nothing compared to what it once was. There were fish huts back then too. Most were avid fishermen and the huts were in use most every weekend. Often with their wives and kids. Still, the fishing remained good. Now, many of the ice huts remain unoccupied and if they are, it's an excuse for a party. Yes there are still some serious fishermen as well in them.  I hated fishing when I was a kid, did it all the time as mom and dad loved it. They still do. When I got the fishing bug again through the 1980's and 90's I never had any difficulty catching pickerel. Had two or three favorite places to go and never had a problem.  Then it happened. When the pickerel population was lowered in the French River, the nets started appearing up at this end of the lake. Guess what..... Ya, had to go further and fish longer to get a feed for the plate. Now it's good if you happen to run across three or four. Many times skunked."
751782,lew,2012-12-14 15:05:00,12766,  Yup  
751802,Rockview,2012-12-14 17:03:00,6,"Disclosure: I run Rockview Cottages on Lake Nipissing and I am Treasurer of the Lake Nipissing Stakeholders Association  I want to clarify a couple points made here.  1. Walleye fishing for sports fishermen (under 40cm) was fantastic here this year. It will continue to be for the next several years as there are now 4 strong year classes (2009-2012). The oldest of these are now just entering into the slot zone where they cannot be kept by sports fishermen.  2. The issue is that there is a very low adult Walleye population due to fishing pressure from both sportsfishing and commercial fishing. Continuing to take the same quantity of Walleye on an annual basis will cause a massive problem in a couple years unless we do something. Our suggestion is to implement our extensive Walleye re-stocking program rather than reducing limits as it is the best solution for everyone - residents, resort businesses, First Nations, tourists.  See below for full details regarding plans/issues. Visit LNSA.net to contact us or ask questions here.  The reduction in the Walleye daily catch limit will have a severe negative effect on the economy of this region. Tourism is a significant industry for the Lake Nipissing region and the Lake Nipissing Walleye fishery is a significant component with respect to attracting tourists. My estimates, supported by Ontario RTO13a data, indicate that the Lake Nipissing Walleye fishery attracts approximately $30 million annually in direct tourism spending to the region. This entire amount is now at risk because of the decision to reduce the Walleye daily catch limit. The North Bay/Lake Nipissing region hardly needs any more bad news with respect to our economic prospects.  There are several facts that are agreed upon by all parties. Lake Nipissing has a low adult Walleye population. The Walleye population on Lake Nipissing is in a stressed condition. Something needs to be done to protect and grow the Lake Nipissing Walleye population. Ultimately there are really only two ways to increase the Walleye population. You can either take less Walleye out or put more Walleye in.  Possible management actions include the following:  1. Extensive Walleye re-stocking. This will allow the commercial fishery and sport fishery to thrive without harming either and won't hurt tourism and the local economy. This action has been proven in numerous other juristictions and the conditions on Lake Nipissing are nearly perfect for a significant re-stocking effort. The MNR has a number of employees and consultants who are conceptually against re-stocking and have been unable to counter our arguements in favour of re-stocking at several public meetings. The conditions on Lake Nipissing are ideal for Walleye and an excellent fit for re-stocking. These conditions include a low adult population, a shallow wind-swept lake with good oxygen levels, good food sources and available/underutilized spawning beds. Re-stocking will allow the sportfishing segment to continue to enjoy great Walleye fishing, provide enough to satisfy the commercial fishing and leave enough adult Walleye to increase the adult Walleye population and eventually grow the overall Walleye population.  2. Regulate/reduce the catch limits for the commerical fishing industry. The Province of Ontario either does not have the will or ability to do this but choosing option 1 can make this unnecessary. This option also places a significant financial burden on First Nations fishermen and it's hardly fair to ask someone to stop providing for their families.  3. Reduce the cormorant population. This will unquestionably help the Walleye population. The double-crested cormorants are not native to Lake Nipissing and it appears the Province of Ontario does not want to upset the environmental lobbyists as there is no other reason not to do this and it enjoys widespread support among all area stakeholders. This option should be a given to be implemented but this option alone is unlikely to completely solve the problem.  4. Reduce the daily Walleye catch limit. This will definitely have a negative impact on tourism and the local economy. Local residents are also extremely disappointed that they are being further limited. The MNR has stated publicly that reducing the take limit will not be effective in reducing the number of Walleye caught so this option was clearly chosen for its optics not its effectiveness.  5. Deal with the variety of secondary issues such as water quality, spiny water flea, etc. The Ontario MNR stated in public meetings that these factors do not make a significant contribution to the decline in the Walleye population on Lake Nipissing.  The Province of Ontario and the Ontario MNR has already chosen option number 4. By choosing this management action, our Provincial Government and the Ontario MNR have taken the easy way out - financially and politically. The Ontario MNR has already stated in public meetings that reducing the daily catch limit will have no positive effect with respect to preserving the Walleye population on Lake Nipissing. The Ontario MNR formed a Public Advisory Committee for consultation on this issue but it's clear that this committee was formed purely to help with public perception to help ""sell"" this decision. Many members of the Public Advisory Committee were strongly against this decision and offered alternatives - which include re-stocking Walleye and reducing the cormorant population.  It is clear that a significant Walleye re-stocking effort is the best possible solution. The only issue would be the financial investment and labour requirements. I am part of a local group called the Lake Nipissing Stakeholders Association. We presented a re-stocking plan to the local MNR office over two months ago and have not received any feedback or response despite our repeated attempts to contact them regarding this. We have offered to fund the re-stocking effort and provide all necessary equipment and labour. Our group has been re-stocking Walleye in Lake Nipissing for over 25 years and we clearly have the skill set and expertise required to implement a significant re-stocking plan. Re-stocking Walleye is the only option that would be a clear win for all parties.  The Provincal Government and Ontario MNR needs only to give their approval, support our efforts and continue to monitor the lake.  As an individual directly impacted by this decision made by the MNR I would ask that you reverse your decision and leave the catch limit as is and give re-stocking a chance. There is the potential for great success without any downside risk.  We are asking everyone in support of our efforts to contact the Minister of Natural Resources - Honourable Michael Gravelle at [email protected] OR [email protected] to voice their support for re-stocking and get the daily catch limit change reversed.

751808,Gerritt,2012-12-14 17:22:00,6129,"Jason,  Thank you for the post! some great ideas here!  My issues are this. The MNR has decided to target only ONE section of the issue at hand negating all others... that being recreational anglers.  Leaving the commercial and NFN unchecked and free to do as they please.  Why is it a native family can do as they please to feed their families... when us as non-native cannot. This is discriminatory and against our Charter. These changes will prevent NON-natives to put food on the table, while our native friends can have 200lbs of walleye fillets in the freezer... You see where I am going here?  I am in agreement with additional restocking! That said are we just giving the commercial interests more fish to catch? and allowing the natives to have 400lbs in their freezer, while we cannot sustain our own families?  I mentioned the Cormie problem in another thread, I agree some action needs to be carried forward... but the anti in Toronto are making all the rules here...  A very sad state of affairs for the Nipissing region for sure.  I feel for all the businesses that rely on tourist dollars to make ends meat... that will be coming to an end I fear....  While the Commercial interests make MORE money.. and the NFN add even more fish to their freezers...  It sickens me.  G"
751809,Headhunter,2012-12-14 17:24:00,5703,"Thanks for taking the time with a well thought out response Jason. I appreciate the insight you have provided. It all seems to pretty much confirm what a lot of us have been saying... As has been stated many times, we all know the reason that Nip is in ths state it is. I think a cormorant cull would help, how much, I'm certainly not in a position to answer that, but I do know is that without gill nets on the lake, the lake has a much better chance at becoming what it was, then with them. And I'm not even going to touch on the subject of ""incidential catches"" because some of the folks here would likely has a fit, should they find out about the piles of Pike, Musky, Bass, perch etc, that can't make it through those nets and end up rotting on shore. I honestly feel really bad for those who's income is based on the Lake. It must be very frustrating to have knowledge, desire and ability, only to have your hands tied by a bunch of bureacrats who really only seem interested in their own agenda, vs what the folks who live it, have to say. Thanks for the link to the pencil pushers... HH"

751812,Gerritt,2012-12-14 17:37:00,6129,"Equality Rights in the Charter Section 15 guarantees equal benefit and protection of the law to people, saying:  Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability. Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability  Section 15 applies to government, not the private sector You can’t use section 15 to challenge every inequality in life. The Charter controls laws and other government actions. It doesn’t control private citizens, businesses, or organizations. Before you can claim the protection of section 15, you must show that you are being treated unequally by a law or by the action of a government official or department or some agency very closely connected to government, such as a school board or labour relations board. If a private individual, organization, or company violates your rights, you may be able to complain under the BC Human Rights Code or the Canadian Human Rights Act. For more information on this, check script 236 – “Human Rights and Discrimination Protection”, and script 270 – “Protection Against Job Discrimination”.  Section 15 protects people, not companies Courts have said that section 15 protects people, not companies or other artificial persons, because it gives the right to equality to “every individual”.  The Supreme Court of Canada’s approach to equality Section 15 does not require everyone to be treated the same way regardless of different circumstances. Showing that the government or the law is treating you differently, or showing that a law that appears to treat people the same way actually treats members of a particular group differently, is just one step in showing a violation of section 15 equality rights.  You also need to show that section 15 applies to the different treatment you received. Section 15 prohibits discrimination because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability. It also prohibits discrimination on “analogous” grounds – meaning comparable grounds not listed in section 15. The Courts have said that something “analogous” is a personal characteristic that you can’t change at all, or you can’t change without great personal cost or difficulty – like sexual orientation or citizenship.  The Supreme Court has said that the central purpose of section 15 is to promote “substantive equality” by fighting discrimination. So in addition, courts will focus on whether the law or government action is discriminatory in creating a disadvantage by perpetuating (or indefinitely continuing) prejudice or stereotyping.     Sound like we are being discriminated against because of our race, ethnic origin and colour if you ask me.    G"
751813,BillM,2012-12-14 17:39:00,17367," To play devils advocate here for a second, if you're fishing for nothing but sustenance you probably shouldn't be out in Nipissing in the first place.   That's a silly argument if you ask me."
751815,Gerritt,2012-12-14 17:47:00,6129, How so? I feel your argument is flawed (difference of opinion)   Thats what the NFN claim they do... they state they fish to feed their families... So why am I not allowed to do so? Because my skin is a different colour? Instead the law states I have to purchase a license (Tax) for the privilege to bring fish home for the table... and now the government says I am allowed to take even fewer fish home (Even though they taxed me)... I am allowed 2 fish in my possession. While another group could have hundreds.... because they a re feeding their families.. while I as a white man cannot.  I feel it is best if I stay out of this thread... going forward I dont want to see it locked up..  Perhaps we can continue this via PM.  G
751816,Rockview,2012-12-14 17:55:00,6,"Many of you are making good points about the commercial fishing issue.  My personal opinion and that of the Lake Nipissing Stakeholders Association is that the commercial fishing issue is not something we can control or influence directly and even if something could or should be changed it won't happen quickly.  Our proposal is that re-stocking is a good solution that will have a positive impact and we can implement it immediately. We are planning to harvest a lot of eggs and raise them to various life stages without it costing very much.  Also, even if you believe that this will only result in more Walleye for the commerical nets, it's important to realize that sportsfishermen will have the chance to catch them in the 13-16 in range before they are caught in commercial nets. Hopefully enough make it past the nets to increase the adult Walleye population.  In any case, doing nothing is not going to help and complaining about natives and commercial fishing hasn't achieved anything either.  We prefer to do something positive that has the potential to work and definitely won't hurt.  Jason  "

751824,doubleheader,2012-12-14 19:03:00,497,"I just waded thru 6 pages of posts on a subject near and dear to my heart, Lake Nipissing and walleyes fishing, yet I'm sitting here feeling quite stunned by Kevin's revelation regarding his health, and would just like to start by saying I'm very sorry to hear about this Kevin, keep the faith, and I'll be saying a prayer for you and Leslie. I started going to Lakair when both Kevin and I were kids, so it's been a few years, and it's been a million memories. Mom and Dad would take us every year, and once I got old enough that I wasn't a total pita I'd get to go with the ""dads"" on their trip too. (That's where you learned a lot, about a lot of stuff ) Back then it was fairly easy to catch a good stringer of walleyes, even though we didn't have all the gadgets nor a lot of knowledge for that matter. Frankly you could be successful and be a lazy fisherman; there was little need to hunt them down. After the early 70's there was a long period of time I didn't regularly fish the Nip, then in 1995 Dad and I made his last trip. It stirred so many memories I've been back every year for at least a week. I've said this a 100 times, but the typical Canadian fishing vacation, such as offered by Lakair, is the best family vacation bargain on the planet. Anyhow, I remember one day at the dock shortly after we arrived at Lakair and asking Kevin for the inside track. You know, ""are they deep, in the weeds, yada yada yada."" His response was probably not the recommended lodge-owner reply but it struck a nerve with me as I realized immediately he was right. He said, ""the fun is in the hunt"". I've been chasing walleyes seriously now for over 20 years. It consumes me. I've fished many tournaments, won a few, and qualified for the Cabelas Nation Team Championship multiple times. Bottom line is, I'm not saying I'm anywhere close to the best in the world, but I am an accomplished walleye fisherman, and here is my take on the Nip, as least as it pertains to the west arm. From 90's up to about 2010 the walleye fishing could be classified as very good. You had to hunt them, but there were plenty of fish to be hunted. I had many days of 10+ fish, and even a few of 30+. These fish were mostly 20"" or better, in fact I had one day in 2007 where we landed 5 fish over 25"". Point is I should have seen the crash coming as I wasn't catching many under the slot fish. For the last 3 years we haven't been able to do very well. One or two years you can chalk up to bad timing, but three years in a row? Last year in 2 weeks of fishing almost every day for walleye using almost every presentation known to man I managed only a handful of walleye. So, I would have to concur with all others that something had to be done, and done quickly. No serious walleye fisherman, including me, is going to continue to go to a lake where you can fish for days on end with minimal results. I surely hope things get turned around, and i am thankful to all of you that are trying so hard to make that happen.  ps. Billy Bob, I don't think one can fairly compare Oneida lake with the Nip and assume a common outcome. The bodies of water are vastly different."
751827,doubleheader,2012-12-14 19:08:00,497, I must respectfully disagree with this post. I have caught numerous walleye on the Nip that fought as hard or harder than a sheepshead.
751828,jimmer,2012-12-14 19:23:00,2730,"A great thread that can probably be repeated for other areas in the province. The unfortunate thing about everyone's belief that stocking can solve the problem is that the MNR says it is way too costly or it will ruin the natural strain. All excuses in my books, but they have been giving that line for many many years now. We all see what stocking programs can accomplish if you look at lakes out west or in the states, so their statements don't hold much for me. I am continuing my group trip to Nip for now!"
751838,aplumma,2012-12-14 19:58:00,6896,"I have living proof that stocking works. We had someone throw a few snakeheads in the Potomac and less than 10 years they are classified as established. This is a fish that is illegal to return to the water alive and tastes good. We have a few tournaments a year now that you can bow hunt, shine (with lights), fish, snag and use any means except explosives to catch. With that much going against them they still have a firm foot hold and we can not get rid of them. Personally while I hate that they got there now they are there they are a blast to fish for and great dinner fare also. I think that stocking is a way to mitigate the damage that harvesting is doing and hopefully everyone can enjoy the bounty of the lake. I for one know as long as the effort to continue improving the fisheries is present I will continue to spend my dollars up North.   Art"
751846,Rockview,2012-12-14 20:14:00,6,"  For evidence that Walleye re-stocking works - Lac La Biche in Alberta and the Red Lakes in Minnesota are excellent examples. In both of these cases, the Walleye fishery had completed collapsed to the point where they could not even harvest eggs on those lakes for re-stocking. On Lake Nipissing, we are hoping to avoid the collapse part and move directly to the ""Walleye Factory"" part. The lake conditions here are nearly perfect for a re-stocking effort to have a significant positive impact.  The MNR often sites examples where re-stocking has been ineffective but they use lakes and conditions that are not remotely close to the current state of Lake Nipissing. The Red Lakes in Minnesota are very similar to Lake Nipissing - including a Native Commercial Fishery and they are a fantastic example of re-stocking success.  Jason"
751848,woodenboater,2012-12-14 20:21:00,2277,The passion for fishing in this thread is pretty remarkable and hopefully bodes well for Nipissing.  @doubleheader  thanks for the timeline of walleye fishing on the West Arm. I'd be fairly sad to see it drop like that over the years with no relief in sight. As for sheepshead...

751948,Nipfisher,2012-12-15 03:57:00,2449," Fedeli sends MNR Minister an open letter Friday, December 14, 2012   by: Kate Adams  December 14, 2012  Hon Michael Gravelle, MPP Suite 6630, 6th Floor, Whitney Block 99 Wellesley Street West Toronto, Ontario M7A 1W3  Dear Minister:  I’m writing to ask you to rescind your decision to reduce the daily walleye catch limits on Lake Nipissing from four to two for those anglers with sport fishing licences and from two to one for those with conservation licences effective January 1, 2013.  Minister, you have taken the easy way out rather than perform due diligence in finding a longterm solution in the best interests of all Lake Nipissing stakeholders and interests. In my letter to you dated August 28, 2012, I outlined possible solutions and causes that needed to be examined with regards to declining walleye stocks prior to any management action to reduce catch limits.  You and your Ministry have been silent on these suggestions, so I can only assume I was correct in my August letter when I stated you had already made up your mind at that time.  If you had done your job, you would know that there are Lake Nipissing stakeholders ready to pay for and fully implement a walleye restocking program for the lake on their own without government assistance. Restocking has been scientifically been shown to be effective elsewhere. All they need, Minister, is your approval to proceed.  I will again point out that Lake Nipissing’s cormorant population has been allowed to grow over the last decade. The birds now take over 100,000 kilograms of fish – more than four times what anglers draw from the lake. You and your Ministry can no longer ignore this issue and need to address it directly.  Minister, tourist operators around Lake Nipissing started receiving cancellation requests within hours of this decision becoming public. They should not have to pay for your Liberal government’s years of failure and mismanagement of this fishery. It’s time you admit this decision is wrong-headed and short-sighted. There is still time for you to reverse it and engage with stakeholders to find a long-term solution. I look forward to your prompt response.  Sincerely, Vic Fedeli MPP Nipissing"
751974,Marc Thorpe,2012-12-15 09:48:00,621,"Hi Jason,your solution and use of local brood is from what I gather your best opportunity. Financial assistance and approval is needed  having worked in collaboration with OMNR and QMNR for some 25 years ,there are times when disappointment arise  1- Have you contacted your senior regional biologist for his support?(I'd recommend working closely with him and wildlife techs)  2- I would amongst all outfitters around Nippissing commence a daily capture log what this will do,in case you cannot get support or overturn the decision is offer next year a complete log/data with length of overall captures (You may be doing it already) and times fished. Catch per rate unit effort with size is a great tool for gathering data and showing trends in fish populations and time invested by anglers. I fully understand that 1 or 2 years may be time consuming but should offer a population portrait which as you stated seems already outlined,Its just one more piece of data that will support your need to assistance from the provincial gov  best of luck"
752009,Billy Bob,2012-12-15 14:52:00,5865,"May I suggest a solution to eliminate Gill Netting on Lake Nipissing.  Impose a small tax on all the resorts on the lake....Like 1/2 to 1% on rentals...(details to be worked out)  Also impose a ""Special"" Lake Nipissing STAMP that all anglers must purchase and apply to their fishing license...let's say for example $5 per stamp...then both monies collected from the resort owners and fishermen would pay the ""NOW ACTIVE"" gill netters on Lake Nipissing an annual stippen up to the amount they have averaged over the last 3 years until these ""Active"" netters are deceased. NO NEW GILL NETTING WOULD BE ALLOWED and those ""Active"" netters would have to turn in their equipment (nets only) and no longer be able to legally net fish of any kind on Lake Nipissing.  Also any extra fund (if any) would go DIRECTLY to a stocking program for Lake Nipissing ONLY...  Details could be worked out...Like this program ends after all ""Active"" netters are deceased, actual amount of the tax and stamp, etc...  This way only those actually fishing Lake Nippissing are the ones contributing to the cause....the resort owner would of course pass on the cost of their ""Special Lake Nippissing Tax"" to those who rent from them. But in the end this would help the resort owners tremendously.  Bob"

We have had similar discussions here and have been fortunate enough to have a member of NFN as a board member, discussing this topic. AS NFN is essentially self governed, it would require real ramifications, by the band, to stop or control any and all gill netting. Based on those earlier threads, NFN really have no teeth when it comes to ramifications for actions not condoned by the band. Being socially ostracized , doesn't stop someone who needs to feed their family.Having no real (financial) ramifications for going outside the rules also makes enforcement a challenge. HH"

The fishery has been excellent as far as fish to catch, if you take the time to learn the patterns. I personally fish for mostly Pike because I like the aggressive bite they are capable of. I have fished a few times with a few of the Musky men of OFC and to this day my record is unbroken beating them despite there hardest efforts to put me on fish. The Walleye/Pikeral have been more of a bycatch than a species I fished for.  I have had the pleasure of a trip to the ponds that Kevin has been supporting and working hard at for at least the 12 years I have known him. If you want to help you can do it one of two ways Volunteering is one and financial support is another. I know that 100% of any money that you get to Kevin is spent on making a difference in the walleye population for all of the people that make a living from the lake.    Art"

751770,Headhunter,2012-12-14 14:00:00,5703,"  I think it's great that so many have enjoyed the area for some time and I also think it's fantastic that folks are getting involved in helping the lake. But this thread is about changes to Pickereye possession not bass or Pike. There are plenty of places to fish for those species, some of which are Pickereye factories, as Nip once was.  I am glad that folks have alternatives to Pickereyes, but the fact that there are once again inequities among the provinces' citizens is what this thread is really about. As we all know, there is virtually no political will to take on this and similar resource based challenges at any level of government... and the fact that no one is listening to us, a dispersed group whose funds support all of the provinces sport fishing is not only annoying, but ultimately frustrating. I was always told that if you pay, you play... unfortunately, we seem to pay, and others play. HH"
751777,woodenboater,2012-12-14 14:44:00,2277,"Agree, this thread is about the bulgy eyes but when another poster noted the sale of two West Arm resorts and whether or not this had to do with the wally population, I brought up the other species to suggest that walleye, imo, don't make or break lodges up there. At least not in the WA, afaik. It'd be great if the numbers were like what many recall as the old days but the other species make up for it I think."
751399,Muskieman,2012-12-12 22:07:00,2472,"Anywhere north of the 50% the information is based on factual surveys and studies but not everyone who fills them out are honest , say a ( Metis Harvester ) not allowed to use a net but allowed to keep anything that bites his/her line ... Same as the retiree who spends his winters on the ice , brings home 4-8 or more Walleye almost everyday for 90 days .. I really don't think that the statistical data is 100% fact either ..but the numbers are making some sense to me."
751401,Kingsalmon,2012-12-12 22:09:00,107," Even if its illegal netting, there is still legal netting.  I mean, how much money is the commercial harvest worth anyway?  I can bet you a hell of a lot less than the angling side.  You have to consider every fisherman driving, buying bait, staying at lodges, food, marina service, etc.  I will bet its 100:1.  The MNR and Ontario government should have bought out the commercial licences and be done with netting.  That way when someone does see a net, there would be no question that its illegal.  I fear that whatever fishing lodges that are left on Nipissing will be in rapid decline in the next few years.  I know for one that our annual club fishing trip to Sturgeon Falls will be a no go because of the new limits.  People are just going to look at other alternatives."

751403,Muskieman,2012-12-12 22:14:00,2472,"There is absolutely no chance of stopping netting ( commercial , maybe ) the traité rights would have to be re-written and agreed upon by all sides."
751406,Billy Bob,2012-12-12 22:22:00,5865,The best for now would be for the locals to start a all out BOYCOTT on any fish or maybe ANYTHING the natives sell until they cease gill netting...

751415,irishfield,2012-12-12 23:23:00,26272,"Another sad side that I don't think anyone touched on.. reducing the limits will just put more pressure on other Zone 11 lakes. Temagami had/has an 18 to 24"" slot that kept things in check on the lake. There was no slot on any other lake in the area. New regs came out in 2010 making the slot 17 to 24"" for all the surrounding lakes and Temagami remained at 18 to 24. You wouldn't think it would change anything.. but it sure did. Many locals started fishing Temagami vs Net and Cassels Lakes to get that extra inch of fish. Now a 2 fish limit down the road..."

751459,Rod Caster,2012-12-13 01:31:00,5784," Yup, it's the illegal crap that is the real problem. Poaching and netting. I'm ok with regulated netting....based on what I know and my opinions.  It'll be interesting to see if they increase enforcement for everybody. Otherwise all this effort is really futility.  I think Talon, Nosbonsing, tilden, temagami and Wasi will see the biggest increase in pressure. Most people fish Nipissing because it's convenient and won't bother trying to figure out the lesser known and smaller lakes up north."

Do the guys running the gill nets help you guys out as well? and are the fish you are stocking, finding their way into these nets? Are the netters stocking at all? or are you supporting their catch with the fish being stocked by you and others that have a vested interest in the Walleye fishery?  G"

If you say they are helping with the restocking effort, as are lodge owners and associations/groups, it seems to be there should be an increase in fish not a decrease. Has a study been done to check the viability of increased stocking efforts, to satisfy both commercial and recreational anglers?  It seems as though only recreational anglers are the target here... not the commercial interests.  I saw mention of Cormorants.. do they plan any control measures to help the stocks rebound? if indeed Cormies are part of the problem....

751304,Marko,2012-12-12 17:27:00,854,ITs crazy that in this day and age we have two different regulations for two different races. Its not ok that a Native person can come and pull a truck load of walleye from the lake and then a non native person comes and gets fined if he chooses to keep 3 or 4 fish for shore lunch. Its not right

751306,jimmer,2012-12-12 17:35:00,2730,"Have been going there for years. Never really kept a whole lot of fish, but certainly did much better years ago. Every year our group talks about moving to another location, but after researching and finding that the price would increase considerably from the package we get from our resort, we end up booking again. Can't find other locations that have very comfortable cottages and nice big huts for the same price. The change won't affect our group at all, because we never get close to two slot fish each. Nip just suits our needs. Yes there are other walleye lakes, but do they have the same services that most operators offer on Nip???"

The new catch limits will take effect when the winter season opens Jan. 1 and will remain in place until further notice. The slot size is unchanged for both licences.

I don't ice fish like i used to but when i did, you could fish a whole season without seeing a game warden. I know a lot of fisherman that won't even flinch a taken four or five walleye home because the odds of  getting caught is very slim. I know a lot of natives, and i know for a fact that they are laughing at us right now."

I expect that the change was directed at sport fishing first because it was easier to do from a legal standpoint. I could be wrong, but making changes to aboriginal fishing rights would be a longer and more drawn out process.  I can't wait to head up North for Christmas to do some visiting with family.

I have a feeling that this will eventually become the norm through the north.  I believe Nipissing was first to implement the lower limits from S-6, and the rest of the province followed suit.  Looking at the regs it looks like they took the slot limit out, but there may be more details to follow.  I wonder if the netters have reduced limits also.  Sad day for all the lodges and resorts on the lake. No way that this is going to be good for business. I guess they will eventually sell and the waterfront properties will become Muskoka North super cottages."
