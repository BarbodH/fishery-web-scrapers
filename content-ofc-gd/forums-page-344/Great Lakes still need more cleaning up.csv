Perch, walleye and smallmouth bass fishing in Lake Erie is the best in the WORLD...."

Probably better than Nippissing ever was and in spite of netting too"
753447,Acountdeleted,2012-12-20 19:24:00,2562,I wish that Ontario would spend $1 billion to clean up the great lakes. Might not be so hard to find a job in the Environmental industry that way.
