After maxing out all my credit cards for the past 2 weeks in anticipation of the ""Big Mayan Event"" I will now have to return everything I bought 'cause I haven't the money to pay for it all!  Biggest problem will be returning the New Dodge Viper I picked up last week. Think the dealer will take it back? I think they may give me a little bit of trouble.    "
