753295,Twocoda,2012-12-20 00:16:00,4130,"after doing hours of research on the subject....it is very interesting stuff...the bottom line is ...it isnt the end of the world...it is the end of the fourth cycle of the sun and they expect a sun event of some sort to begin what is refered to as the 5th cycle (also known as the ""purification cycle"" but the references comparing our calander to theirs is very interesting"
753307,shane,2012-12-20 01:33:00,652," So it's not really the ""end of the world"". It's more like ""the end of this world as we know it now"" And 'purification' means it will be better.  Well...I hope they are right."

753030,Roy,2012-12-18 21:56:00,13728,Friday and Saturday will be annoying here on the board as it is every time some failed attempt at electroshock therapy/waste of space human being announces one. I thought I might be seeing better deals in the classifieds though.
