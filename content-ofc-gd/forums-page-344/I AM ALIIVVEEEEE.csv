753586,Bassassins,2012-12-21 13:00:00,111,With the end of the world coming I told myself I would GET OUT FISHING AND MAKE ONE LAST VIDEO! That's how dedicated the Bassassins are....  But seriously just a little fun testing out some new toys - Marcum VX 1Pro and a home made underwater GoPro mount - everything is working GREAT! Just need to find some bigger fish..... but a day filled with 20+ of these guys is far from a skunk.    Enjoy - Happy Holidays!
