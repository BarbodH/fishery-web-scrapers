753777,Christopheraaron,2012-12-22 01:10:00,3525,"Probably can't, but which ones?"
753778,Twocoda,2012-12-22 01:11:00,4130,check the weather before you commit ....its nasty up here right now and not forcasted to change...I live on a Huron trib and i wont be out there ....just a heads up
753781,Freshtrax,2012-12-22 01:17:00,2215,"Thanks for the heads up, casting in 71 km/h winds don't seem like much fun.   I checked the temps but not the wind.  Looked nice mix of sun and cloud -3 , lol not so much with those gusts"
753782,strik,2012-12-22 01:22:00,175,Just  got in... I would stay home   lots of cars /trucks in the ditch.  Sunday might be worth the drive.    I Live in Paisley  just got back from Owen Sound
753784,Freshtrax,2012-12-22 01:27:00,2215,"Screw it , I'm coming anyways.   I have a few sheltered spots that will work out.    What's the worst that can happen, I get cold, and snowed on and enjoy a few hours fishing and get skunked.  Sounds better than sitting on the couch to me."
753789,Christopheraaron,2012-12-22 01:49:00,3525, Let us know how you do! Good luck!
753826,Woodsman,2012-12-22 05:09:00,1286,In Seaforth it is quite windy now. Some snow flurries blowing through. Local creeks flowing fast and high most over the banks.
753829,Freshtrax,2012-12-22 05:15:00,2215,"Just finished tieng up some roe,  I'm on vacation haven't fished in over a month, you guys can't talk me out of it.  If I'm the only one out there that means more fish for me!"
753920,NAC,2012-12-22 21:30:00,369, Bet it was cold and lots of guide freeze.  How was the fishing?
753921,Christopheraaron,2012-12-22 21:34:00,3525, If he's smart he's still out enjoying the last hour of light
753926,solopaddler,2012-12-22 22:16:00,8605, If he's smart he's sitting in front of a crackling fire right now with a stiff drink.
753927,misfish,2012-12-22 22:23:00,29133,  :santa:
753940,Twocoda,2012-12-22 23:51:00,4130,the sun was out for a bit up here today ...but there still wasnt any available light for the fish...Mississippi mud comes to mind and probably just as cold....
753944,Freshtrax,2012-12-23 00:08:00,2215,"Just walked in, got a late start fished 2-5. Nice vis. On the river I was on.  Nothing like chocolate milk      About 2 ft of vis.    Lots of fish swimming around but they wanted nothing to do with roe, so I switched it up to a 1/16 jig head and a 2inch gulp minnow under the float and   went 2/4 the last hour I was there.  Sorry no pics I was solo .  Still haven't figured out how you guys get the fish to stay still So you can take a picture mine always flop around like crazy..  Nice to see some water in the river finally.  And it wasn't that cold guys,  I've had much colder sitting on the snowmobile parked in the middle of lake simcoe."
753945,ChrisK,2012-12-23 00:12:00,2772,Good on ya bud. I was supposed to be out today as well but ended up sitting here sick with a nasty chest cold. Tomorrow is supposed to be even a better day with +1 temps and I'll be here still
753951,Christopheraaron,2012-12-23 00:47:00,3525," I was supposed to go tomorrow aswell, but not anymore"
