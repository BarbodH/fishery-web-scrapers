She was taken to the vet and found this BIG guy on ultrasound just lounging inside, with no apparent urge to present himself!   As Golden pups normally weigh half a pound at birth, they knew this guy wasn't coming naturally when he weighed in at 1.1 lbs! It seemed with no other pups marinating there wasn't enough internal pressure to get things moving along naturally.  Meet ""Dude"":    ""Hey Dude, wanna go fishing?"""

753009,mercman,2012-12-18 21:15:00,7054,DUDE !!!!!  What a chic magnet he is. Congrats.
753019,I'mHooked,2012-12-18 21:33:00,525,"We lost our 14 year old Golden girl 11 months ago, so there are some anxious people in the house about Dude making his grand appearance!  While we won't have him officially until sometime in Feb., we can at least visit over Christmas and he can start getting to know who smells like what.  Last couple of dogs have been female, so we're changing things up a bit with Dude.  Cheers."
