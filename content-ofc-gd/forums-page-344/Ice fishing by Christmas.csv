753208,Locnar,2012-12-19 16:41:00,645,Do you guys think snakker lakes around Gooderham or Kinmount should be good soon?
753209,mr blizzard,2012-12-19 16:49:00,1589,"Hope it keeps cold for all of you, so you can have some awesome hardwater fishing. Having moved from Barrie last year there is never uncertanty about ice up here.  It shows up in October, this is a picture from our house  October 11 looking out over the back."
753211,misfish,2012-12-19 16:50:00,29133,"Da rivers are wide open.  Thats where I,ll be christmas day."
753212,Fisherman,2012-12-19 16:51:00,7201,Might be getting colder but I don't think the windy conditions are going to help the processs much..
753214,mr blizzard,2012-12-19 16:54:00,1589," The pic did not download but the mountains look nice wherever the are, woops."
753215,mr blizzard,2012-12-19 16:55:00,1589,Thats what I was trying to show you.
749782,Freshtrax,2012-12-07 01:45:00,2215,Them back lake gonna freeze up soon if we don't get too much snow.  Cheers to slamming some splake and lakers (lakes that are open year round)  over the holidays .
749786,Rod Caster,2012-12-07 01:59:00,5784,You've read my mind! I'll be checking out the ice this weekend... Can't wait!
749787,jeffw,2012-12-07 02:02:00,267,I'm planning on hitting the some splake lakes next weekend aswell. A custumer of mine drove by one of my lakes tues and said she still had ice so should be good by next weekend.
749790,Christopheraaron,2012-12-07 02:10:00,3525,Does anyone have a site for ice conditions in Halliburton?
749817,mike rousseau,2012-12-07 03:16:00,4661,Ill probably still be in my boat at Christmas......lol... Trolling the ice edge waving to ice fisherman..... Thinking how much warmer I'd be in my ice hut....lol
749833,NAW,2012-12-07 04:20:00,4022,Getting the itch real bad!
749837,Freshtrax,2012-12-07 04:38:00,2215, Even if there were I wouldn't trust it .   No replacement for experience .   Lets have a safe year out there guys.  No need for a funeral over a couple fish.
749838,jedimaster,2012-12-07 04:38:00,3472,"I am all psyched up for ice fishing this year, gonna go for some splake and lakers for sure over the xmas break."
749856,Christopheraaron,2012-12-07 07:59:00,3525," Alright, does anyone up there have any news on when it should be good by? I can't really just walk out my front door and check..."
749860,fishindevil,2012-12-07 08:40:00,6254,My gf brother lives in north Haliburton around the Dorset area and lots if the smaller lakes are froze but only a inch or 2 on them but guys are usually fishing the smaller all year open lakes by Xmas every year !!!! As long as we don't get another real warm spell !!! Sturgeon lake froze over yesterday but only a skim .....
749861,Christopheraaron,2012-12-07 09:14:00,3525," Thanks FD, guess I'll be up there for my first trip of the season around christmas for some holiday brookies."
750175,Marko,2012-12-08 14:50:00,854,"My friend fished 2 smaller ponds just last weekend, and said other one he drove by didn't have any ice on it. Ottawa area somewhere. This rain isn't really helping one bit but ice is going to be here sooner then later."
750582,GYPSY400,2012-12-10 00:48:00,191,The small lakes here in Sudbury are frozen.. Should be safe to travel on by the holidays for some specks or pike. The bigger lakes that have lakers might not be safe for the January 1 opener unless we get a good cold snap.
750618,Freshtrax,2012-12-10 02:26:00,2215,There's a few small lakes with lakers open all year
750619,Joeytier,2012-12-10 02:30:00,3990,"Iced some brookies on a solid 4"" today."
750991,Rich,2012-12-11 13:13:00,3927,How far south is the safe ice? Would love to get on the ice earlier with a trip to the haliburtons..
750993,Rod Caster,2012-12-11 13:23:00,5784,"The snow cover 'round north bay slowed the ice-making process. Not all small lakes are good here..... even with the recent cold temps. I'd say most small lakes have only 2.5 -4.5"" right now."
750995,NAW,2012-12-11 13:31:00,4022,THIS MORNING!!  Orr Lake   Little Lake Barrie   Ice fishing is getting close!!!!
750996,ecmilley,2012-12-11 13:37:00,2163,last winter i was drilling holes in sturgeon lake on dec 26 into 3-4 inches of ice. hoping the same this year if not more ice
751134,Freshtrax,2012-12-11 23:00:00,2215,I'm pretty sure water temps are a fair bit lower than this time last year ( I have no data but I'm almost positive and too lazy to look it up).   All we need is a few -15 nights with no wind and most lakes wll snap.
752235,Locnar,2012-12-16 15:46:00,645,I'm just really hoping a few small lakes up by Gooderham will be good for New Years.
753192,jedimaster,2012-12-19 14:42:00,3472,"  Thats some steel balls, I don't think I would go to the middle of a lake when the shoreline is sitting at 2.5 haha"
753195,lew,2012-12-19 15:34:00,12766,"Parts of Clear Lake in the Kawartha's is frozen all the way across, but other parts are still wide open.  Gonna be awhile yet."
753196,jedimaster,2012-12-19 15:36:00,3472,What do you think about the smaller lakes north of you? Have you hear anything about the ones around apsley?
753197,lew,2012-12-19 15:43:00,12766,"Haven't been up that way for awhle jedi, but with the colder temps coming they may be good....but don't take my word for it"
