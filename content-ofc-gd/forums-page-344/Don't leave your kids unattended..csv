753226,jedimaster,2012-12-19 17:41:00,3472,shadow don't just blop and appear they roll into frame. there is plenty of ground before it appears for it to have appeared.  Not to mention the guy it flies past has zero reaction even though he is walking in the direction of the bird. He would have ducked. Have you ever heard a large bird swoop down? Its not silent. You can hear the wind rushing.
753228,jedimaster,2012-12-19 17:47:00,3472,haha.  sure sure... get the Kool Aid down .

753385,ccmtcanada,2012-12-20 15:23:00,7971," Yep...article in the Star as well...  Baby-snatching eagle video goes viral, but Montreal animation school admits it was fake  http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1304371--baby-snatching-eagle-video-goes-viral-but-critics-say-it-s-a-fake  For several hours, millions of people around the world thought it was a real golden eagle swooping down and snatching a tot from a Montreal park before dropping the baby unharmed.  A YouTube video titled The Golden Eagle Snatches Kid went viral, leaving many to ask: Could this be a hoax or did this happen?  Well, the truth came out Wednesday afternoon when a Montreal animation school admitted that the hoax was hatched by third-year students.  Both the eagle and the child were created in 3D animation and integrated into the real shooting, the school, Centre NAD, said.  Normand Archambault, Loïc Mireault and Félix Marquis-Poulin, who were taking part in the simulation workshop class, had brain-stormed with each other about making a video with wide appeal.  And they decided on their subject because everyone loves babies and animals.  But how to combine the two?  The idea took flight about five or six weeks ago. Once the project was approved, they made a deal with their teacher that if the video surpassed 100,000 views on YouTube, they would get 100 per cent on the assignment.  It did much better than that, wildly growing past 5 million views by Wednesday afternoon, which made the 400 hours they put into the project well worth it.  The video was picked up by dozens of media outlets across Canada, the United States and Europe.  We were also surprised by the events, Claude Arsenault, spokesperson for the school, told the Star.  Weve done some hoaxes in that class before, but they never reached such proportions. We were the first ones this morning to see the numbers going up, she said. Were very proud of our students. This was definitely great quality work. Needless to say the students will get a full mark on that assignment.  Other hoaxes performed at the school involved a penguin that had apparently escaped from a zoo in Montreal (watch below)."

753158,bigugli,2012-12-19 12:33:00,6138,"Large raptors will commonly attack much larger meals like young sheep,goats, large dogs, etc.. The small child was just easy prey. It may sound horrible, but nature does what it will."

753199,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-19 15:53:00,10439, It's on the internet. It must be true because you can't put anything on the internet that isn't true!!!
753200,blaque,2012-12-19 16:16:00,2419, Where'd you hear that? (loaded question hehe)
753201,BillM,2012-12-19 16:18:00,17367, Do you have a date with a french supermodel in the near future?  LOL!
753204,woodenboater,2012-12-19 16:28:00,2277,"looks legit on first watch. shadows line up etc.. but am open to it being a good hoax. of course, I thought of this commercial after watching it lol  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqYOv3-nqUo"
753205,BillM,2012-12-19 16:28:00,17367,"It was a Teradactyl, not a golden eagle."

753207,jedimaster,2012-12-19 16:36:00,3472,Fake... Just ran it through some video.. and the shadow appears partway through the flight... I'll upload in a bit and post a link.I have done a fair bit of bird watching and you can see shadows of birds hundreds of feet above the ground so 20 feet should be plainly visible.
753216,jedimaster,2012-12-19 16:57:00,3472,
753220,woodenboater,2012-12-19 17:23:00,2277,"I dunno, the framing was off so the shadow coulda been just off the bottom ( you can see the relative location in the frame where you can see it) and out of the frame. Snopes didn't have anything on this yet so am giving the benefit of the doubt to the uploader. for now"
753223,jedimaster,2012-12-19 17:33:00,3472,look where the shadow first appears and go back it had about 200 yards to appear before the tree shadow. It would have been somewhere. PLus not a single other person in the video even acknowledges a bird circling so low to the ground.
