753736,Christopheraaron,2012-12-21 23:05:00,3525,"I'm trying to assembly an ideal spinner for pier fishing. I plan on making it with roughly size 5 blades (glow painted), a heavy body for casting, and about 3 1/2 inches long. My question is what style of blade would give me: the most vibration, falls the fastest and stays down? Thanks!"
753750,Andrew Grant,2012-12-21 23:39:00,201,.
753754,Christopheraaron,2012-12-21 23:52:00,3525,"Ya, really I'm looking for the depth of willows mixed with vibration of colorado"
753758,Rod Caster,2012-12-21 23:57:00,5784,"Maybe a fluted type or a french blade.  Or if you go with a colorado or indian style, try to get a heavier gauge metal; it'll add  weight for the drop, but keep the resistance."

753763,Nipfisher,2012-12-22 00:12:00,2449,  X2 Randy. You beat me to it.
753780,Twocoda,2012-12-22 01:14:00,4130, Somebody has been spiking your egg nog?
753785,Muskieman,2012-12-22 01:28:00,2472,"   Yes , it was me"
753786,John Bacon,2012-12-22 01:36:00,3277, X3 - I guess I need to check the board more often.
753803,Rich,2012-12-22 03:25:00,3927,"I gotta take the Triple Threat's side on this one. Put a heavy little bell in front of that big blade to get your distance and depth. Also helps with line twist on big blades, not sure why."
753805,Christopheraaron,2012-12-22 03:33:00,3525, You mean a bullet?
753814,Rich,2012-12-22 03:46:00,3927," If you go bullet go brass over lead or heavy tungsten.  A bell is like a bullet but curves and narrows at the top, like a bell. Usually brass."
753854,Christopheraaron,2012-12-22 14:04:00,3525,"Hmmm, ok. Cause a bell sinker is the one you'd tie to your line for bottom fishing..."
753861,Garnet,2012-12-22 14:35:00,2056,"You need to make a variety that you think will work in your situations. Color, size, shape, weight and anything else that matters to you.  Now get 2 of the exact same rod,reel,line, snap swivel. And next year start casting and comparing.  Report back when you have a conclusion."
753864,Rich,2012-12-22 15:28:00,3927,Yah. Totally different thing.
