752864,highdrifter,2012-12-18 07:43:00,2534,"Welcome back to the grind Gerritt!  I've been on nights for the last couple years..  12-8am, mon-fri.  It's life altering for sure, especially if you have kids.  I'm pretty much free to do what I wanna do when I'm not at work so I can't offer much in that regard.  Toughest part is no doubt the sleeping bit.  Trick is to cancel out the light as much as possible.  I've tried a bunch of methods but the best I've found is to line your bedroom window with tin foil, and cover it with a black out blind.  Get the best black out blinds you can afford.  They'll reduce outdoor noise and regulate heat/cold.  You will need pitch darkness.  If that means stuffing the bottom gap on your bedroom door - do it.  As for noise, ear plugs are a mand's best friend.  The softer the better.  If you sleep on your side, you need only one in the exposed ear.  I've found that one in the ear next to the pillow can be painfull and isn't really necessary.  Another thing:  Try not to eat anything before you sleep.  Give yourself at least 2-3hrs after a meal.  Sugar and fried stuff makes for a pretty restless shnooze.  Hope this helps.  Good luck.  cheers HD"

752877,BITEME,2012-12-18 12:30:00,1968,All I can say is this wherever you go to sllepp in the house make sure it is dark no light day or night you will adjust but you cannot put of the sleep eat your meals normally or eat a bunch of small meals throughout the shift you will adapt but it wont happen right away most important thing though is the total darkness its a must  and watch this it may give you some insight. http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episode/lights-out.html remember force yourself to sleep i know it sounds funny sometimes not easy to do but you need to do it and religiously.  good luck advice from a long time shifter  Peter
752879,Spiel,2012-12-18 12:33:00,9065,"Congrats on the job Gerritt.  I worked that very shift pattern for many years, you're gonna die."
752880,Live2fish85,2012-12-18 12:36:00,1633,I hate shift work. Although I the shift style you are working is better I found. You tend to get used to it more then a week or two straight of nights then days then back. This way you just never get used to it and are always tired haha.
752882,grt1,2012-12-18 12:44:00,638,"when i do the midnight shift i come home and go straight to bed, sleep till 12-1230 then i';m up until 530 then back to bed until 1030. it seem to be the only way that found that works for me. the only thing is that my midnight shifts go for 5 days then i have 5 off. it seems that it takes 2 days for me to get back to normal and for my eyes to stop burning. BUT, i'm 66 and old bodies don't seem to adapt well as younger ones do."
752887,fisher,2012-12-18 13:35:00,451,"Can you not work something out with a co-worker so that you work all the night shifts for say 2 or 3 months, and your co-worker works the day shift?  And then switch. Obviously the company would need to be on board with it...Maybe it would be something you can look into after being there a few months...  If it were me, I would prefer to have a set schedule for a longer period of time instead of constantly switching it up."
752890,dave524,2012-12-18 13:42:00,4508,"I worked that 12 hour rotation for about 1/2 my working life, fortunately I was single , living alone for most of it. Look on the bright side, 1 week you get 3 days off the next you get 4 days off and the best part the rotation I had, once a month you got off at 8 am on Friday and didn't have to be back in till tues at 8 am, better than a long weekend Retired for 4 1/2 years now , good pension and benefits, that is the best, eventually it is all worth it."
752891,Fish Farmer,2012-12-18 13:44:00,2234,"X2 38 years at Stelco on shifts. 36 was 8 hour shifts, then they put us on 12's, it killed me. I couldn't sleep at the best of times. Being a crane operator and doing a 12 hour night shift put others on the ground in danger because I only had a couple hours sleep at best. Thats what made me retire. Was falling asleep at the controls, not good. I didn't go to work to kill my work mates. I had to make the big decision, getting older and no sleep, time to hang up your hat. I tell you you never get used to it, unless you are different. Mite be alright if your on the ground working and you don't put others at risk. Siting in a cab (box) for 12 hours, picture yourself siting in your closet for 12 hours with no sleep. Congrats on your new job Gerritt, Good luck man."
752898,Moosebunk,2012-12-18 14:27:00,3970," Well put... and once upon a time used to do the same thing with staying up all day and going fishing.  Crashing out in the tent or back at home by 7-9pm and sleeping 12 hours.   Didn't want to scare ya Gerritt about shift, your schedule is going to be hard man, but you will see how it works for you.  Personally, I could not and would not do 5 days a week until reaching that point when shift is absolutely killing me.  Plan is for about 10 years in the future, work 6-7 months full-time northern contracts then casual to not much at all May through October.  Shift can be great.  It's 9:10am this morning and snowing pretty good.  Fire is on in the basement here, and just sitting down to a cup of coffee after seeing the little one onto the bus. All is quiet.  Might just do nothing all day.  Work only 3 days this week.  Yesterday went to see the Hobbit with the kids on their Snow Day.  Once the ice is solid, it'll be just as quiet on the lakes in my Clam playing fisheogames on the Lowrance.  Not sure how old your kiddies are but mine get on the bus each morning by 8:00am and come back for supper.  That gives dad 8 hours at least to go play, but because my oldest is older now, she can hold fort if I'm going to be later to dinner.  Shift and their school, then gives the availability to basically fish most weeks 4-5 days midweek if wanting to.  It's nice to pick and choose when, never feeling like I have to cram a day, two, three, or four into the week, but rather just fish or do as I please.  This year, days fishing came in only about 20 days less than days working... And besides trips away, not much time gets missed with the girls.  Shift is a great and free life nowadays.  Have found that time is as important as money, but health and happiness more than both.  I've turned down some great work opportunities in the past, just to balance more time on my side."
752915,fishing n autograph,2012-12-18 15:30:00,2540,"I work 12 hour shifts...2 days, 2 nights 4 days off....  As for tips, you do what works for you. I definitely recommend taking a nap before nights. I usually take melatonin before the first day shift so that I can get a good night sleep before work. The drive home after night shifts can be hairy. Lots of coffee and sunflower seeds to keep you awake."
752961,Twocoda,2012-12-18 17:59:00,4130,i used to eat barbituates like they were candy to re-adjust ...then i finally found it easier to stay on nights for two years straight....summer time was always a pleasure to be on nights...avoided the heat but winter really sucked living by artificial light.....I havent worked shift in 15 years and im still trying to recover from it...Good Luck and congrates Gerrit...stability in life comes with a price...
752972,HyperActive,2012-12-18 18:39:00,56,"For 7 years I worked all three shifts in the same week. Everyday we started at a different time somedays it was at 6:00 am after getting home at 2:00 am, then the next day we would leave at 7:00 pm and return at 4:00 am, somedays we literally went home for a shower and had to leave again, if I was lucky I would squeeze enough time off my shower to make a sandwich. I always found the hottest shower I could possibly stand followed by a 5 second blast of cold water helped me fall asleep quickly."
752976,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-18 18:48:00,2582, Some here are questioning this. Having worked 4 different 12 hour shift variations. I can tell you that this rotation is by far the best for your health in my opinion. Every time you walk out the door at work you come back in on the opposite shift after your days off. It sounds brutal but here is why it is better and has been proven to be better.  The old standard is a  static 2 week rotation  of days and then a 2 week rotation of nights. It's all cookies and cream for your 2 weeks of days. Then you hit nights. Your body tries to adjust to nights for your 2 or 3 working shifts and then tries to adjust back to days on your days off in between then back to nights for your next 2 or 3 shifts then back to days etc etc until you get through your 2 weeks of that rotation. Switching it up means you tough it out for your 2 or 3 working nights and then your body is on days for a week.  This was my 4 week rotation. Is yours anything similar G?  S-off                  M-days                T-days              W-off             Th-off               F-nights              Sat-nights S-nights            M-off                   T-off                 W-days          Th-days            F-off                    Sat-off S-off                  M-nights             T-nights           W-off             Th-off               F-days                 Sat-days S-days               M-off                   T-off                 W-nights       Th-nights         F-off                    Sat-off  If you look at it and think about it you will notice the benefits. You work your nights shifts and then your body gets to go back on days for an entire WEEK. Then you work your nights and your body gets to go back on days again for an entire week. The only time your body is really on nights is while you are working. When our company proposed this rotation we ALL hated the idea. No one wanted to do it. The company was sure it was a better choice so they agreed that we could try it for 6 months and then vote on whether to continue with it or go back to the old 2 weeks days/nights rotation. After 6 months we voted and I was one of the workers on the floor who got to count the votes. Only 3 people wanted to go back to the old rotation.  If your rotation is the same or something similar G..you have the best 12 hour rotation out there IMHO.
753088,Gerritt,2012-12-19 00:45:00,6129," Almost identical I have some weeks with 3 days off, some with two... And alot of overtime available.... They do something called averaging, which we had to sign a form for.. I understand and it seems more then fair. My hours are averaged out over two weeks.  so If I wish to pick up overtime I am best to do it during the 36 hour cycle.  I want to thank everyone for their advice, It has been helpful. I know I can handle this as I could fall asleep standing up (and have) 3 days of training out of 8 under my belt...... safety safety safety.  Thanks again folks,  I have printed off this whole thread for future reference.  G"
753094,mistaredone,2012-12-19 01:29:00,913,Worst part for me was waking up every day and not knowing if it was 6 am or pm. Doesn't sound like much but it would really mess with my head. Good luck!
753110,dhickey,2012-12-19 02:30:00,1038,Congrats on the new job sounds like a good one I myself have never worked shifts but do have a couple friends that have for the past 20yrs. The key thing with them is after their shift they eat then sleep on the turn they go till they drop then prep for next shift. They also watch what they eat.Mainly nothing but heathy food no fast or proccesed food and they dont drink/ coffey/caffene.  Keep your body cleen and you will be fine.  They also work out at a gym at least 2wice a week.  It will be hard at first but go for it you wont regret it.  You can DO IT!  Good luck Gerrit  Don.

It sounds like the plant I started at.I worked there for 10 years before transfering to Brockville 18 years ago.Best advice I can give you,as others have pointed out,blacken your bedroom with heavy black curtains or material.Wear earplugs,it helps a great deal.Eat light,fresh fruit,toast, yogurt, cereal.Limit your caffine intake if you can,or you will be waking to make multiple trips to the bathroom.The evening before starting nights,I stay up as late as I can watching Tv,then sleeping in as long as possible.If you have any other questions feel free to PM me.

752708,ketchenany,2012-12-17 23:29:00,3229,"Many many years ago I worked all 'three' shifts. The hardest was the midnight . . . Got home at 8 and tried to go to sleep with no luck until the after noon, get up eat and fall back asleep and get up and do it again! The summer was the worst for me kids outside playing , nice warm weather etc.  Also Saturday was bad, after getting home didn't want to go to sleep to do things and late afternoon, lights out, didn't impress the wife when we had to go out.  For that shift unplug the phone."

With only 2 days between the change, your brain never really gets a chance to get into a rythm.  But nonetheless, congrats on landing a good job."
752713,davey buoy,2012-12-17 23:33:00,5505,Dark blinds are worth there weight in gold. As mentioned Phone off!!That short switch around is going to be brutal no matter what you do. Sorry:dunno:
752716,Terry,2012-12-17 23:38:00,14456,"worked the same shifts as you're getting, one winter when construction was slow many years ago...I could not adjust to the different times. just couldn't sleep during the day, blackened the bedroom windows to not let any light in. had a sign on the front door telling people I was sleeping during the day so go away..salesmen always ignore the sign. tired all the time ..... just could not adjust so I quit and went back to construction."
752718,DoubleDigits,2012-12-17 23:42:00,140,"That is a tough shift, I know. Continental I think its called. With regard to night shift  I would say first, avoid all energy drinks--redbulls, etc. If you drink coffee, stick to that, drink it as normal. Also, don't go to bed right when you get home. Eat a meal with the kids, make your lunch or whatever, unwind and go to bed when you're ready. The switch can be tough, but you'll get used to it. If its 7-7, just wake up nice and early the day your pm shift starts, be active, and then take pleasure in the fact that you can take a 5 hr nap in the middle of the afternoon and no one can say anything about it! Also, use earplugs. Really helps you sleep through house/traffic noise. Finally, use your off days to recharge, and take advantage of the priceless mid week !!!"

752720,DoubleDigits,2012-12-17 23:45:00,140,"You're young! You can do it! I really think it depends on what type of sleeper you are.

752725,moxie,2012-12-17 23:51:00,1566,Congratulations on the new post. I've worked straight mid nights years ago and to tell you the truth I never got used to it but you might be one of the lucky ones. Good luck.
752764,Moosebunk,2012-12-18 00:47:00,3970,"  Congrats on what ""might be"" a living He!! for awhile.  Once worked a 2on, 2off, 3on, 3off, 2on, 2off - 14 day rotation and repeat.  EASY!!... when it was either days or nights.  I'd wonder why this employer of yours would put you through the kind of rotation that has you switching so suddenly and often?  I'd think it will be tough, especially at first.  That's my experience with quick flipping and short recovery times between D & N shift.  Too bad the many of you hired couldn't collectively come up with a better plan?  2 weeks of days, then 2 weeks of nights would even be better.  Less flipping' and you'd get into the rhythm of either or.  Biggest troubles I face with sleep deprivation are moodiness, (quick temper) sore lower back, poor decision making and poor diet.  Quality sleep is needed to rest the mind and muscles, science is not lying here.  Having known this for years, I prepared during that bigger work stage of my life up north.  And so, that's why I work part-time now in this southern land of hospital shift-work Bull, and now only pick up extra shifts that work for me.  And rarely give availability for extra nigths.  When you make it through the two year contract, you will certainly know if what you've given up, and what you're feeling was worth it.  I don't envy what's coming your way Gerritt.  In healthcare I could do what you're planning too back in my early 20's... not so easy now I find.  If it's physical or mental labor it's still work that you need to likely be at your best for.  When you come off nights, ""IF"" you're able to go home and sleep right away, you can only do so a few hours in the morning and then you will have to drag yourself up and around the rest of the day in order to get good rest that coming night.  If you can't sleep that evening, an aid might be in order for just that one night.  (sometimes it's a couple fingers of scotch and a Gravol)  Next day you should be OK, then next day back to work.  Fine... you made it once... or you make it everytime... but...  Those switch days are tough, they can be write-offs.  The lack of sleep over a long period does catch up, because sleep lost is never regained no matter how you try.  Each flip day to me feels like a day lost too, and the day you have to go in for the night shift you hold back on stuff too.  I can't make committments easily on the flip day because it could be one full night running in the ER and you're dead, or a quiet night with breaks that wasn't so bad.  You'll maybe leave people hanging sometimes and then just learn to not bother making plans.  Social life becomes more difficult too.  Sometimes want to nod off in the kids Ju Jitsu class because you're tired while on a flip day and just sitting there.  Missing every 2nd Christmas due to work.  Having only every 2nd weekend off and missing parties, poker and being able to fish with the M-F folks.  Missing family related things, period!  The big plus side, more total days off, often for yourself, fewer people on the lakes and riverbanks, easier to get those chores done and more quiet time.  Be warned of one thing though, jealous type people might soon hate on ya for being able to go fishing more than them, I do have experience with this too. lol.  Best things I do to cope and prepare.  Be as organized as you can about dates and events planned.  Your new work life doesn't jive with most regular working folks, those 5 day a weekers.  You also ""maybe"" don't want to be making big banking decisions, purchases or trip plans on the day you've slept three hours in the last 36 hours.  Exercise when you can, and often if you can.  I like to row.  All work seems easier when you're feeling up to it.  Drink extra water at work.  Most of us on shift in the ER show up with litre bottles each shift and try to drink at least one, or two.  On nights it sometimes seem I have to force a litre in.  Your body's usual pattern is to eat and drink during the day and sleep at night.  Appetite may be weird on nights, so be sure to at least stay hydrated.  It'll help a little too with muscle soreness because of poorer sleep.  Get used to earplugs and/or white noise when sleeping.  It helps to drown out the world.  Cut back on caffeine, especially any cups nearing sleep time.  Smokes, booze and sugar too.  This is in the handbook man!  Pack healthier foods for nightshifts, not crappy snacks.  The lesser sleep you do get is even more important.  Fish as much as you can.  Do the things that make you happy, and do them even more.  If you're job has you alone, try and do more with others.  If you're like me and constantly working with the public, many of them upset, ill or stressed, find times alone or with another to just chill, or pound on the fish to take your mind away from work.  Leave work at work too.  Good luck."

Did that for about 2 years.  My next job was in IT again and for the next 5 years we did 4on, 3off, 3on, 4off.  1month of days, 1 month of nights.  That 4th day could be a killer and that first night shift was a tough ride home but again, you get used to it.

Some were 3D-2N, 4 off, 2D-3N, 5 off. Unless all the others at home understand your need for sleep in the daytime, it can be holy hell. Fortuntely back then the kids were good about it.  When I got to straight days about 5 years ago, it was unbelieveable, bacon and eggs at the right time of day, poop at the right time of day, you get the picture.  Your body will hate you..often."

I was fortunate to have an understanding family, they knew Dad would be moody, especially on those quick turn arounds. Most good ideas covered above. 1. Don't let your coffee consumption get out of hand. 2. Booze can really take the edge off when u feel like crap, but keep it in check, it's easy to let it get out of hand. 3. Try eat regular, wholesome meals, even tho you don't feel like it. 4. Darkest curtains you can get. Make that room black. 5. A regular workout routine makes a difference. Good luck."

752855,Woodsman,2012-12-18 05:32:00,1286,I did it when I was younger & actually liked it. 7 days off every 2 weeks. Most people only get 4 days off every 2 weeks. The way our shifts were set up was similar to yours. Worked every second weekend & had a three day weekend off every second week end. Days off mid week are great for fishing away from the crowds.
752858,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-18 06:04:00,2582,"Worked 7-7  12 hour day and night  shifts for 18 years G. Absolutely loved it. I would kill to have it back. Have been a Monday to Friday guy since 2003. Still can't stand working 5 days in a row after all those years of 2 or 3 days in a row.  The sleeping part. Well here is what worked for me. Pitch black bedroom. I mean you can't see your hand in front of your face. I made up cardboard frames with foam around them to fit snugly in my window sills. No light was getting through those babies. I just threw them under the bed when I wasn't using them.  I even stuffed towels under the bedroom door to block light.So now it's nice and dark. But the dang neighbor is cutting his lawn at 10AM...THE NERVE... just when your drifting off to la la land. Buy your self a fan. Test them out and pick a real noisy one. Turn it on when you go to bed. You will get used to the noise of the fan running in no time, it will become background noise you won't even notice. Plus it will move the air around in your bedroom which is a nice bonus in the summer if your dark airtight room gets a little stuffy. The  main purpose of the fan is that it will drown out a lot of noises that will wake you up. The wife starts a load of laundry...you can't hear it. The TV is on... you can't hear it. A neighbour or your kids friends pop in..can't hear it. Your family is just having a chat...can't hear that either. Your $19.99 fan from Walmart will become your best bedtime buddy.  Trust me on that. Our company was very proactive on sleep and shift work.  Others have already mentioned coffee and booze. I have nothing to add there. Research they found somewhere was always being passed on to us. One trick they suggested seemed to work for me on the days I tried it. When you have a shower just before you go to bed turn the water temperature down as low as you can tolerate for the last part of your shower. The reasoning is that your body temperature actually drops a little while you are sleeping so by having a little bit of a cold shower just before you hit the hay you are actually tricking your body into thinking it really is bedtime. Another thing they mentioned wear dark sunglasses on the drive home in the morning when you are just going back to bed because you have to work again that night. The reasoning there is it will be brighter outside..in the summer time anyway...then it was in the workplace. So your body will want to stay awake. Sunglasses will lessen this effect.  The swing days. When you work until 7AM in the morning but don't have to go in again that night. I handled them in 2 ways. If I had plans that evening..sons hockey game etc etc... I would come straight home from work have my cold shower and go right to bed and set my alarm for 1PM. You WILL feel like death when that alarm goes off but drag your butt out of bed. Have a coffee or do whatever to get your heart pumping. After awhile if you have not committed suicide you will feel fine and you will be wide awake for whatever your plans are for that evening, but you will still be tired enough to go to bed at your regular bedtime as if you had been on dayshift that day. The other swing day option is come home in the morning and just stay awake all day. It's not as hard as it sounds as long as you keep busy.  These used to be my fav midweek fishing days. I'd have the car packed and head for the lake right from work. No weekend crowds just me and the fish. Fish as long as you want but don't stay out past the point where it would be unsafe for you to drive home. These days I would come home from fishing mentally and physically exhausted have supper with the family and then pack it in early and sleep right through until the next morning.  Others mentioned some of the cons of working weekends when the rest of the world mostly works M_F. They are all true. But there are some positives there as well.  You get invited to something you really don't wanna attend. So you just dust off the... Well I'd really like to go but I have to work that weekend  It will come in handy   Good luck with your new job and your new hours G. If you have any other questions about shift work feel free to shoot me a PM."

All the best answers Gerritt have all ready been posted from those of us who do what we do and you will have to use every one , what's been working best for me over the years is to make sure i get my seven to eight hours of sleep before i have to go do my shift and its a must , and as many naps as i can fit in . When you can start to feel like all your doing is sleeping then you have it down pat . Good luck ."
