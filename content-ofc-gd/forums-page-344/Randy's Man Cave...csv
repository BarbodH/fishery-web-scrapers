I have some work left to do like, new carpet and some tiles, a new bar top , paint and trim and build a lit top for the fish tank, re organize my mounts and get a few more... but it's very useable as is.

I priced out a tap system, WOW! just the set up is 350$ plus a CO2 account ( Beer Store doesn't handle this anymore )and a Keg is 8 cases and only good for about 30 days, for me It's not worth the cash, It would be if I didn't have to work in the mornings  Nick, It's a Pellet Gun   "
