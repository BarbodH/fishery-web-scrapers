753082,MJL,2012-12-19 00:02:00,2427,"I like it!  Very nice Chris  After working serious OT the last few weeks, I'm definitely thinking about having a 13' 2pc CTS done up for next season. Fuji YSG guides this time"
753218,HTHM,2012-12-19 17:02:00,4082,"Ya know Chris, you might just catching on to this rod building thing.... Excellent work as always!"
752054,Spiel,2012-12-15 18:41:00,9065,"I have a number of blanks here for myself and never seem to find time to work on them.  Well after having this particular blank in my possession for almost a year I finally found time to get working on it the last few days.  It's a 12' CTS rated 6-10 tied in a twist for a baitcast steelhead set up. It's not done yet but I've made progress on the bottom section, finally!  Fuji SiC guides, custom wood by my buddy John Collina and wrapped in candy apple red with silver and red metallics.  The wood still needs to be polished up but it's finally coming together. Hopefully I'll get a chance to test 'er out before things freeze up.            "

752193,Sharkbait22,2012-12-16 13:12:00,297,"Very Nice Chris.  What are you going to do for a reel?  I recently bought a Avid 10.6 #6-10 caster on the advice of others here.  Amazing deal too. Now I'm thinking of a reel.  Spriing is still far away so I have time.  I did look at the new Calcutta.  They are smaller than before.  The 400 is more the size of a older 200, and there is a 300 available. Just an FYI."
752195,Spiel,2012-12-16 13:23:00,9065,"Thanks all.   You know what they say Brian, ""if you have to ask......"" I've been using a baitcaster for steel for a number of years now, love it. Just wanted another option in the arsenal.    Will do Bud.    While it's not finished I did throw everything on the scale (less the thread I'll use) and she comes in at 175 grams.    No Sir, didn't want to diminish it's value.    PM me any time Randy if you want to discuss options.    Some day Dan, hopefully soon.    Thank ya Sir, I do have a Shimano Calcutta 200 TE DC for it."
