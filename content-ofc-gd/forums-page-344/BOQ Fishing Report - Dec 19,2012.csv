753291,superdad,2012-12-19 23:42:00,353,"After a road trip to review the launch ramps on Tuesday, we hit the water at 0830, made a first pass from Lyons Island to Pull Point, tough going into the west wind, made the return pass out over 65-70 feet of water and and the outside board fired at 1020 ( Rapala TDD11 Bubble Gum{something like that- bought the lure at Pro Tackle last year} approx 200' from the board).  Brought the planer board across the inside board and fouled lines - D""oh!!!!!!! Laker john slide the net under the walleye - first since NOV 17TH..... A nice fish - 23.5 inches and tipped at 5.68 lbs.    We changed all the lures to TDD11's and made another pass from Pull Pt down past the island. The pattern wasn't working real well, so Plan B.  Trolled down the middle of Adolphus Reach (many good memories in that area), Spread 4 rods, two TDD11's and a pair of Reef Runners.  We wondering if we would see another strike, we assured ourselves that things could change in five minutes- at 1320 the inside board with the Reef Runner (Purple with gum drop colours). Laker John was into a fish, we got ourselves positioned and the net ready. 200 feet of line takes a while. He brought the fish to the net and she was ours. A nice 25.5 incher weighing at 6.25 lbs. Couple of quick pix and splash, back she went.    As I was resetting the line, the other inner board fired and I was able to have the board removed and then a quick head-shake at 175' and the fish was gone. Two hits, one landed in five minutes....Never can tell.  Trolled eastward until the winds were getting out of order and we pulled the pin and hit the launch ramp and headed home.  We both felt better with a 2 for 3 day after our last number of skunky outings.  We have fished from the boat in every month this year - that's our main claim to fame.  Stay Tuned  David aka  Superdad"
753303,Roy,2012-12-20 00:58:00,13728,You're certainly hearty gents David and John. Really nice dark fish there. Reefrunners are my goto's when walleye trolling. Thanks for the report David.
753312,woodro,2012-12-20 02:26:00,168,"Awesome, its always nice to get the skunk out of the boat. Seems like the quinte fish are starting to really respond as the weather gets cooler."
753334,kickingfrog,2012-12-20 04:02:00,8333,"Good stuff, from a determined angler but ""Fishing from a boat every month this year"" is something I hope you are not able to say in 2013."
