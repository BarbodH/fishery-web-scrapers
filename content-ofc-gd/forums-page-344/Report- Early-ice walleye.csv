752652,quickme,2012-12-17 21:07:00,261,"i was reading about the quickfish2...  read that it has issues with the poles.   Seeing that you recommended the quickfish you don't have any issues.  I like the fact that its a touch bigger with more fishable area.  Have you used a clam before Rod Caster?  If so, I'd love to hear you're pros/cons.  Sorry I know I'm starting to thread jack now...  PM is fine   nick"
752670,Rod Caster,2012-12-17 22:06:00,5784,"Its ok. Less work to just answer here.  I've only owned the quickfish for a couple weeks, so my reliability test iisnt complete. Also, I've never used a Clam pop up so I can't compare.  On the other hand, I get feeling that Luc and I have a good compparison test in the making because we will be fishing in the same climate, we fish nearly the same amount and from the sounds of it we might be just as hard on equipment. Clam vs Eskimo... Luc vs Chad haha"
752705,LucG,2012-12-17 23:19:00,779, Sounds like a challenge to me lol

752739,Leecher,2012-12-18 00:11:00,7832,The North Bay crusaders are at it again    Relieved you got to use your other fishing apparel for this outing Chad Awesome season starter   Great job you two
752883,quickme,2012-12-18 13:09:00,261, Man I wish we had ice down here!!!!   Keep the reports coming.  Nick
752999,TJQ,2012-12-18 21:00:00,7806,Hey!! Where did the pics go?? LOL
753077,Rod Caster,2012-12-18 23:58:00,5784,"Haha, don't worry, there will be more to come! They were a little too showy for a fishing report"
753273,wormdunker,2012-12-19 22:09:00,1711,Put the pix up!  Pleez
753274,Rod Caster,2012-12-19 22:12:00,5784,"Oh dang! Sorry, I didn't realize you were talking about the pics in my post.. I thought you meat the jigerr photos.  I made my photobucket accnt private... Didn't think about the effect it would have on my fishing reports. Changing now..."
753440,phatpelkey,2012-12-20 18:56:00,78,where you guys fishing at north bay?
753441,Rod Caster,2012-12-20 18:56:00,5784,Pm sent
753555,GreenCanada,2012-12-21 03:45:00,375,"Looks like a good day on the ice, even with the freezing rain!"
752462,Rod Caster,2012-12-17 01:26:00,5784,"Everything I own that was facing East today is covered with ice, including the backside of my jacket and toque. The winds were fairly strong and the freezing rain was persistent. Ice was solid at 4"" to 6"". The fishing was slow at first but the action sneaked up on us and the next thing we knew, we filled our combined limit of 6 walleye under 43 cms (Joey has a conservation license).  We fished in 8-15 FOW, most fish coming from 12 FOW with minnows or jigging spoons. It was a good start to the winter walleye season!        "
752464,NAW,2012-12-17 01:32:00,4022,"Right on guys!  First the Splake, and now this.  Season is off to a great start!"
752468,Cudz,2012-12-17 01:39:00,2652,nice
752469,Acountdeleted,2012-12-17 01:41:00,2562,"Oh man, looks like I picked the wrong day to come out.  Seriously though nice catches. Totally worth the crummy weather."
752470,Joeytier,2012-12-17 01:43:00,3990,Haha Jeremy I was thinking the same thing.  Great way to kick off the walleye season
752481,Nipfisher,2012-12-17 02:55:00,2449,Good job boys. I'll be hitting that spot a couple times this week.

752554,oldphart,2012-12-17 14:53:00,665,"~~~Wish I was out phishen on ice instead of sitten at my desk, Harrumph Harrumph"
752559,JimC,2012-12-17 15:37:00,86,"I am Soooooooooooo envious!   Good going, and Great pics!  thanks for sharing.  ... on the other hand, I did get in 18 holes of golf (my other passion) on Friday, here in Kitchener, and didn't even freeze ... so that is good."
752560,Rod Caster,2012-12-17 15:38:00,5784,"Hey, golf in december! That aint so bad at all!"
752592,limeyangler,2012-12-17 17:15:00,5204,Holy moly Chad...putting a hurt on the fishes .....great start to the season
752604,ehg,2012-12-17 18:03:00,2666,Good to see some successful fishing happening. Very nicely done.
752608,LucG,2012-12-17 18:34:00,779,"Good job man! Nice pike!  Sorry I didnt make it out after splake on Sat, went out for walleye instead.  I was out for walleye on Sunday as well, we as well got rained on, but the fishing was good. Didnt do as good as you, but brought home dinner.  Here's a pic of my new setup: Clam Vista, Lowrance sonar, and my Mr.Heater. I don't want to leave the shack now haha   "
752614,Spiel,2012-12-17 19:12:00,9065," I agree with N.A.W, you're off to a great early winter season."
752630,Rod Caster,2012-12-17 20:17:00,5784,Thanks again everyone!   Luc: Nice setup man  That Mr. Heater looks much warmer than my single element propane heater.  Did you get a good deal on the tent?
752634,LucG,2012-12-17 20:29:00,779," Yeah, it does a pretty good job at warming up my shelter. I think I paid around $160 for the tent. I'm glad I went with this purchase, not only is it cheaper then spending the $500 on the fish trap I wanted, but the weight and size is alot easier to handle, especially for bringing it indoors to melt off all the ice from the frezing rain lol  Inside it measures 6'x6', but the hub style, there is alot of ""elbow"" room. Happy with the purchase overall, now we'll see if it can take the beating I'm about to give it lol   Once the ice stiffens up again, we have to make it out together."
752636,quickme,2012-12-17 20:37:00,261,"hey LucG,  I was thinking of getting the same Pop up.  How was the set up?  did you do it by yourself or did you have a partner.  I don't have a sled/ATV so I'll be dragging it out.   Thank you in advance.  Nick"
752637,LucG,2012-12-17 20:42:00,779," It takes literally 30 secondes to pop up, alone, plus the time to anchor it down if needed. It was a little tricky the first few times, simply cause I didnt want to force anything and break it before I had it on the ice. But after puting it up and taking it down a few times, it got alot easier. Also nice and light."
752641,quickme,2012-12-17 20:46:00,261,  Thank you!!!   makes me feel better about committing to a pop up.  Tightlines!
752643,Rod Caster,2012-12-17 20:49:00,5784,Same goes for the eskimo quickfish2. Super eaasy to setup and haul around.
