He said he ""paid a small fortune for it"" when he got it a few years ago.  It's in good shape just needs a cleaning from the dust.  So any ideas of what its worth?  Cheers.  G"
753237,Terry,2012-12-19 18:45:00,14456,this might help  http://store.vernondeon.com/index.php?opt=detail&ID=18&PID=5566
753241,GBW,2012-12-19 18:59:00,8460,tks Terry.  I guessed $250 new give or take a few $$
753242,Terry,2012-12-19 19:04:00,14456,"if in great condition, I would think so"
753315,GBW,2012-12-20 02:32:00,8460,"Tks Terry, he's going to sell it for $200 if anyone is looking.  I tried it on and man it's nice and kind of wish I was in the market for a new one..."
753318,Rod Caster,2012-12-20 02:36:00,5784,Would it fit someone 5'10 and thin build?
753322,GBW,2012-12-20 02:40:00,8460,done deal. I tried it on @ 6' tall and 180LB with room to spare.  With not a HUGE amount of room BUT I would rather this over my Mustang 185 XL I have any day.
753323,Rod Caster,2012-12-20 02:43:00,5784,"Hmm, sounds like it might be one size too large for me. I'm 160 and don't want it bulky at all. Sounds like a good deal though"
753335,GBW,2012-12-20 04:09:00,8460,"I'm 180 soaking wet on a bad day.  You would rather to lager than too small as if it's too small, crotched...  Heck, if he doesn't sell it I'm all over it and selling my Mustang suit.."
753345,Woodsman,2012-12-20 08:40:00,1286,"Hey guys I did a search on it. A big Red Flag is ""Canadian Coast Guard approved"". This is a long way from a new suit. It is been a while since the Canadian Coast Guard has been the approving authority. Transport Canada is now & has been for more than a few years the approving authority. Comparing to current prices is not realistic.  That being said I have a Helly Hansen Delta II & it's a great suit. "
