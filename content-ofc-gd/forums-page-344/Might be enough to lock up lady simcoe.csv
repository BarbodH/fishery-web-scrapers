753958,Freshtrax,2012-12-23 02:37:00,2215,Just barely but I think for the most part it will lock up and get the freezing started. What do you guys think? Those two days with 5km/h winds have me excited
753959,Terry,2012-12-23 02:55:00,14456,well parts of cooks bay....if the wind stays down
753960,Freshtrax,2012-12-23 03:04:00,2215,I think cooks will be good to go by the 2nd or 3rd....off gillford for sure
753961,irishfield,2012-12-23 03:13:00,26272,"There was white caps on the Grand River today... in downtown GALT. Gonna have to get really calm before any ice starts happening, even Orr Lake was wide open again this morning. By now... Terry and I are already heading towards Kinmount for a day of ice fishing, not gonna happen this holiday season!"
753964,Woodsman,2012-12-23 03:27:00,1286,I hope Simcoe locks up soon but in the mean time I'm heading for Temagami on the 27th.
753967,irishfield,2012-12-23 03:50:00,26272, How much ice are they telling you is there Rick?
753968,BillM,2012-12-23 04:08:00,17367,With this wind?  Simcoe isn't close to locking up.
753970,Woodsman,2012-12-23 04:32:00,1286,My fishing partner's brother lives up there (free place to stay ) and is reporting ATV's and sleds on the ice. We'll be walking so I doubt ice thickness will be a problem. With the cold weather forecast it will be making far more ice. Decided not to take the machines as where we plan on fishing are not far walks. Less gas to get there not dragging the large trailer for 6 to 7 hours.
753971,irishfield,2012-12-23 04:45:00,26272,Thanks Rick.. I presume you're talking some of the smaller lakes and not Temagami itself. This is a shot from only 10 days ago.. wide open other than the bay in town and the narrows down by boatline marine.
753973,Freshtrax,2012-12-23 06:03:00,2215,In the original post I said I was excited for the 2 days of 5 kmh winds
753974,BillM,2012-12-23 06:21:00,17367," Sucks when those 5km/h winds turn into 40km/h  We need a few weeks of really cold temps, all this just below zero crap isn't going to cut it for ice."
753975,Guest,2012-12-23 10:36:00,0,"  Total agree.  It was starting to freeze over, but things warmed up and we got wind.  Im putting my money on it freezing over in the third week of January.  Hopefully im dead wrong"
