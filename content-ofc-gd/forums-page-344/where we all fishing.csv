753529,fishindevil,2012-12-21 00:44:00,6254,Gonna snowmobile into a few back lakes in the Bon-echo prov park area and do a little speck fishing while I'm riding for a few days my buddy went in on his quad a month ago and hid a new auger so we don't need to bring a lot of gear in just a backpack and we will hit a few speck lakes we hae done well in years ago !!!!!
753531,dhickey,2012-12-21 01:03:00,1038,Nice Drifter Getting up there for a couple months is tops on my bucket list.
753416,ecmilley,2012-12-20 17:25:00,2163,"Not much happening right now no ice, ranger put away, looking forward to doing some fishing over christmas or new years if any ice forms have a couple back lakes for eyes and lakers to hit in the new year, what everyone else planning on?"
753429,Terry,2012-12-20 17:53:00,14456,"I plan on following peoples footprints to back lakes....lol  hope for some bays to freeze, if not the rivers"
753434,Christopheraaron,2012-12-20 18:30:00,3525,I fished yesterday and I'm back to the rivers sunday. Then in a couple weeks I hope to try a few haliburton ponds.
753436,jimmer,2012-12-20 18:34:00,2730,"It's quite a bit colder today, so maybe the kawarthas will tighten up and allow us out for some panfish. Not holding out any hope for the small lake trout lakes in Haliburton County. It seems any lake with depth are slow to freeze to a point where it is worth venturing out for a fish. Not worth the risk for me. Speckie lakes might be a different story."
753437,Christopheraaron,2012-12-20 18:42:00,3525," The lake I'm hoping to try is a speck lake, 0.15 sq/km. not sure how deep."

In the new year when Bancroft lakes freeze over I had a tip on where to land my first laker (I hope). and as everyone else, waiting for Simcoe to freeze. I'm making a list of lakes I want to hit up though."
753448,Rod Caster,2012-12-20 19:27:00,5784,"Nip is #1 on my list, I love fishing that big 'ol gal. Also I have a bunch of small lakes I'd like to ice fish in my area. I'm still looking for my first big laker so that's also on my list.  Last but not least, fish Simcoe with some members here"
