The fishing was a little slow but did end up with this bass.   I did manage one good size carp but lost him at shore.When I got him in I noticed he had wrapped himself in my line and as I went down to grab him he took off again.I grabbed my rod but not soon enough as the line snapped.Oh well, can't catch them all.Here is a pic of my rod during the fight.  I had one more fish which did not fight like a carp or a bass so I was surprised when I got this one in.  All 3 fish were caught on corn bottom fishing.That is what I love about the Grand, you never know what you will get.While down there I was treated to a great sunset so I took a lot of pics.Here are some,hope you enjoy.I did.

114045,007,2007-09-15 02:15:00,537,It's nice to catch a surprise fish!  That's gotta be the first bass I've heard of being caught on corn though!  Nice little trout too.  Congrats.  You've got the fishing bug bad!  Keep the evening reports coming.  007

114110,Rich,2007-09-15 13:03:00,3927,"Awesome! Did you take that little trout home? He looks perfect for the BBQ (or frying pan).  I can attest to catching them on weird things too. A couple days ago I got one a little smaller than yours on a giant doughball for carp. Never did catch a carp, just a trout, lol"
