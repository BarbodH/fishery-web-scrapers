Saw some folks working the water when I got there, but was told that there wasn't much doing..  Started casting cleos and HJs, and switched to the good ol glow in the dark when the sun started setting.  I almost fell in when my rod doubled over with the run of a solid fish, but was broken off about a hundred yards out, give or take..  All I had left were 5/8s, but still managed some good distance.  Another hit, and a great battle insued!  After multiple breaches and solid runs, I thought for sure I had hooked into a steelhead...  Turns out that it was a Coho!!    And the promo shot..    cheers  HD"

What you said is something I will have to keep in mind when I go the pier, even after guys are leaving and saying ""not much doin"" , I will look past that and think of this post.....and probably still catch nothing, but hey, I'll keep pluggin away.  Again, nice going."
