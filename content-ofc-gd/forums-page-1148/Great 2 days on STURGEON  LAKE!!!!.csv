113675,Big Cliff,2007-09-14 08:55:00,6899,"Excellent report and some really good photos!  I got out last Sunday morning for a bit but it was so windy that I couldn't fish the area I wanted to. I did a bit of exploring but only got a few small mouth.  About noon the wind had died down a bit so I headed back out again and the fishing was better than I have seen it in years. I couldn't believe it, middle of the day, wind out of the ENE but in the first 15 minutes I had three walleye in the boat all in the 15-17 inch range.  I continued fishing for about two more hours and managed several very large perch a few small mouth, one more walleye (a little smaller than the others), and  one nice large mouth."
