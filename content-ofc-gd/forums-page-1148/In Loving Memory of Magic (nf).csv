113718,Basskicker,2007-09-14 12:09:00,421,"Unfortunatlely last night we had to put down our lovable Magic due to medical reasons.  It has been a very hard week for my fiancee and myself, life just seems so unfair. The poor little guy was only 9 months old, and provided us with lots of love and laughs. We couldn't stand to see him so ill (VIP) and had to do the humane thing last night at 12:45 A.M.    May You Now Rest In Peace"
113719,ccmtcanada,2007-09-14 12:12:00,7971,"Oh man Jason....I'm very sorry to hear about this.  We were just talking the other night about how sick he was.  Terrible news, but I think you did the right thing.  If you need to get out fishing or whatever to take your mind off things, just give me a call.  Cliff & Carole"
113722,TJQ,2007-09-14 12:15:00,7806,Loosing a pet sucks... my condolances...
113728,fatherof3,2007-09-14 12:27:00,1769,sorry to hear but it sounds like you did the right thing for Magic
113729,lew,2007-09-14 12:29:00,12767,"Sorry to hear that, putting a friend down is one of the hardest things us pet lovers ever have to do.  I have a feeling you gave her a pretty nice life though in the short time she was with you."
113736,blaque,2007-09-14 12:38:00,2419,"Hey Bass, Ive been thru that a few times......like countless others. But very sad to hear with such a little guy. Its a terrible position to be in for sure but hes definitely in a better and more comfortable place. Its good to see people out there such as yourself with such compassion for their animals. Sounds like he was in the best hands he could have been in."
113879,John,2007-09-14 18:02:00,2956,"It's a very tough, but kind and responsible thing to do Jason....so sorry to hear it.  John..."
113886,ecxstriper,2007-09-14 18:11:00,343,I feel your pain . It is very hard to watch the innocent suffer and then have them put down .
113891,Deano,2007-09-14 18:19:00,767,"Sorry to hear that. Having been there, I can relate. I sometimes think back, but if she were still alive, I probably wouldn't have the 2 loving dogs I have now. So I consider myself blessed for what I do have."
113909,ADC,2007-09-14 19:18:00,82,as a Cat owner myself I know its not easy.  He was a real cute cat !  Im going to give my cat extra play time tonight in memory of Magic
113911,addict,2007-09-14 19:31:00,475,my condolances bro.
113925,steve_paul,2007-09-14 20:08:00,658,"Very sorry Basskicker, had to put down 2 of my pets in the last year and it is so hard.  It was the same thing though, it is what is best for them so they don't suffer anymore.  Sorry for your loss."
113934,Big Cliff,2007-09-14 20:19:00,6899,"I am so very sorry for your loss, we take them in and they become part of our family. They give us so much love and ask for so little in return. Be happy that you could at least spare him a lot of suffering!"
113939,motv8tr,2007-09-14 20:26:00,2587,"Sorry for your loss, I know only too well how it feels....  Maureen"
114009,Jeff R,2007-09-14 23:43:00,94,"Sorry about your loss bass. Doesn't seem to matter how old they are, they manage to make us feel like they've been with us our whole life. When we had to put down our 5 yr old border collie a couple of months ago, for medical reasons, the vet said "" it is a great and loving friend that would never allow a friend to suffer. She knows she is loved""....It didn't help much at the time, but it will get better  Jeff"
114016,live2fish,2007-09-15 00:09:00,70,Thats to bad bro looked like a cute cat to bad it was so young. I got a call from my neighboor the other night that my cat got hit on the road. I went out to get him and he still had the mouse in his mouth. He was old and had a geat life so its a little easier to let go.  Bowen
114022,ChrisK,2007-09-15 00:28:00,2772,Sorry to here about your kitty cat but for every door that closes one shall open....
114027,bassmastermike,2007-09-15 01:07:00,295,Sorry to hear about your loss it takes time to get over the loss of a pet i had to put my shaina down in may due to medical reasons as well but it is not fair to let them suffer. My condolences
