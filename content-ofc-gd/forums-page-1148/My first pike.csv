So I ended up fishing the harbourfront. Had only a couple of follows and bites after the first couple of hours but around 7:30 when the sun was just setting I caught my first 2 pike ever within 10 minutes of each other! They weren't hogs by any stretch of the imagination but I was excited as hell.  Thanks to the random passerby who took a pic of me with one of the pike.  I have to hang around the photography forum more so I can figure out how to get the proper angles to show the size of the fish.  "
