113988,Garry2Rs,2007-09-14 22:33:00,1425,Is there an easy way to post pictures on this site? The computer that I'm using is older that DIRT...It was assembled from other peoples junk...grin. I'm not set-up with my provider anymore I no longer have the software. In other words I'm in no shape to post pictures unless there's a spot on the site that I can put then. Garry2R's
113990,fatherof3,2007-09-14 22:35:00,1769,try using photobucket.I find it an easy site to use and easy to get pics onto here
114020,Beans,2007-09-15 00:24:00,3339,"Garry...down below where you type text there is an area for attachments...click on ""choose""...choose the pic you want...then ""upload""  once your attachment appears above the ""choose"" area click there and click on the green sheet...this will put the pic in your post (in thumbnail form for folks to click om to enlarge)"
