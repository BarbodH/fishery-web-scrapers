113588,Rizzo,2007-09-14 01:09:00,4754,"I have a Minn Kota powerdrive bow mount trolling motor with foot controls.  There is a sliding mechanism, that lets you select a speed from 1-10.  For some reason mine seems to be running at full speed, ignoring the setting that is on the foot control.  Nearly launched me into the lake today when I first turned it on. Any thoughts on what may be causing this and how to fix it?"
113594,Gerritt,2007-09-14 01:16:00,6129,Sounds like corrosion to me... if you look closely you will see the circuit board and you will see a metal arm that slide up and down (type of potentiometer) If you have developed a bit of corrosion (metal deposit) at the top end it completes the circuit.... take the unit apart (if it is not under warranty) and give it a good cleaning with wd40 and a soft lint free cloth.  Gerritt.
113613,Rizzo,2007-09-14 01:46:00,4754,"thanks Gerritt, I had taken it apart earlier to see if there was anything obvious (loose wire) but didn't notice anything.  I'll give the wd40 a try"
113614,Garry2Rs,2007-09-14 01:55:00,1425,Aickman's in Toronto is the service centre.  Their number is 905-277-3595. Garry2r's
113628,Rattletrap2,2007-09-14 02:35:00,1652,"Sounds like gerritt is on the right track. The slider is a potentiometer (variable resistance) and it may be shorted out. I love Minn Kota, but those Power Drive systems are very fragile. I would never opt for one again. The cable drive system with Maximizer is the way to go. I've seen more of the little micro switches for right and left steering crap out on the boards, than I have seen Slider Pots fail.  Aikmans in Missisauga or Rockey in Orillia will most likely just swap out the entire board. it will cost a few bucks no doubt.  Good luck and let us know how you make out."
113632,Garry2Rs,2007-09-14 02:47:00,1425,"I have taken a cable steer to Aickman's and an electric steer to Rocky's and blame it on good looks or charm, I have never paid for service on a Minn Kota. Garry2r's"
113633,BFSC Kevin,2007-09-14 02:48:00,1351,"i had the same prob, brought it to aikmen's in missisuaga, got it fixed in no time when he had the part, less then an hour. but for me it was under warranty still, otherwise it is like $100 for parts and $50 for labour?"
113669,bassmastermike,2007-09-14 05:29:00,295,Well thanks guys i just bought a powerdrive !! I guess I know what to expect LOL
113850,Rizzo,2007-09-14 17:04:00,4754,"Thanks for all the replies.  Tonight I'll try and clean it up as Gerritt suggested.  If its still going like gangbusters tomorrow on Balsam, I'll drop it off in Orillia on my way home.  For those worried about having a powerdrive, I've been very pleased with it.  Although its only a 40lb thrust, you feel like you could waterski behind the dang thing.  When buying it, I thought it would be underpowered but the salesman told me it would be fine for a 14' boat.  He was right (I actually bought it from Tromnbley's in Orillia). This is the first problem I've had, and the motor is over 5 years old"
