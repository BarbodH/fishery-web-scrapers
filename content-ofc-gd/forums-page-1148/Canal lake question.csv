113958,Jonaton,2007-09-14 20:53:00,72,I am heading out to canal lake tomorrow and was wondering if it is even worth thinking about muskie. I have heard the fishery is not doing to well up there for muskies. Would it be better to focus on the other species? I know muskies are few and far between even under good circumstances but would rather not waste my time completely chasing something that is not there.  Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer Jonaton
