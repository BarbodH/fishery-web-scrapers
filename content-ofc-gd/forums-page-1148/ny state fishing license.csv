113236,stuntman,2007-09-13 02:43:00,96,Scam Alert!!  Well more like a dont pay too much warning.  The site linked by the previous post is not a not end with a .gov designation.  Have you ever seen those Canadian citizenship ads that are not from the Canadian gov't: 'for only $50 you can have a citizenship application'. The applications are actually free.  The person selling the application is scamming (in Toronto no less!!!).  Here is a link to the NYS gov't site that has the rates posted: http://www.dec.ny.gov/permits/6091.html  Stuntman
113240,solopaddler,2007-09-13 03:06:00,8605," The link I posted is not any kind of scam, All NY licences are sold by DECALS. It's 100% legit. The DEC website you posted actually provides a link to the website I posted for those wishing to purchase online."
113249,MJL,2007-09-13 03:37:00,2427," Not sure what the fuss is all about  I got to Solopaddler's link from your link by clicking  1. Sporting licenses 2. Purchase a sporting license 3. Scroll down to ""Online*"" and click 4. Continue to purchase a license online"
113519,stuntman,2007-09-13 21:45:00,96,"Hey All,  All the fuss was:  - link to non-government domain -no documentation on how the link was obtained.  Was the poster was in the know about such things or did they just google it? -people get gouged everyday -the information posted was not verifiable on its own, more info could have been posted.  The proper way to communicate the info, in my opinion came later in the thread:    disagree if you like, but, now the person asking for the information now has information he can trust.  Its a public forum, not everyone is right 100% of the time and proper answers are rarely communicated on the first go.    Stuntman"

We used to get them at the campground we stayed at, he was no longer allowed to sell them and we had to go to the town hall to get one."
