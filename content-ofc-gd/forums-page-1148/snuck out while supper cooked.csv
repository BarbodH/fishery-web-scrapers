Got home in time to finish cooking the roast.Here are 3 more pics I took while walking my son to school.

113683,fatherof3,2007-09-14 10:15:00,1769,"Thanks again guys. Roy,was doing up a roast in the slow cooker and started it too late in the day which meant I had free/fishing time while waiting. It was worth the wait"
