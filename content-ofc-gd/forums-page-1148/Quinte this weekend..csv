Friday is a toss up between Trenton or Napanee.  Saturday we are planning on Picton to Hay Bay and Sunday will be Wellers Bay.  My question though is,  for Friday where would you head to, Trenton or Napanee ? Any replies would be appreciated."
112551,Hooked,2007-09-11 16:54:00,891,"Heard the fishing has slowed down big time, but if I were you, I would check out Big Bay.  I know they were hitting alot there in August, so I guess Trenton would be my pick.  Good luck."

When you come to town....drop by and see Sam at Carra Outdoor Sports..his service/sales/partner and friend..Glenn...is a guide for Quinte waters and will put you on fish for sure...but everything has been slow...slow. Wellers has been producing a lot of X-large ..LM Bass and now look for the Salmon commimng off the big lake from the West. Point Anne ,,just west of Belleville has always been a great area for LMBass ...and Gigantic GarPike,( a treat to catch if youve never done so...just make sure your rigged correctly and have the right releasre tools) Mouth of the Trent in Trenton has LMBass onthe west side and the walleye are moving up river now and this is their point of entry....Launching out of Trenton on thew east shore is FREE..and so is the paRKING. Start by getting in touch with Glenn at Carra outdoor Sports......he know where the bite is...........bring a pic of yourself with OFC apparell on and the info is free and your pic will be also added to Sams growing selection on his sales wall. Good luck to you and get in touch with Sam for sure...............bNb For Musky..........The Moira river is doing real well right now from what Ive heard...just severley low waters as is the rest of the province from what ive read..............enjoy."
