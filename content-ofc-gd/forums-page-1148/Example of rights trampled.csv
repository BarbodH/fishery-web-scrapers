113837,walleyed,2007-09-14 15:58:00,8,Some interesting reading on how a C.O. abuses peoples rights. http://www.canlii.org/on/cas/oncj/2004/2004oncj407.html
113839,Guest gbfisher,2007-09-14 16:13:00,0,there's always one!
113840,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-14 16:13:00,957,"Thanks walleyed.  ""Our"" Donny is one wreckless, out of control boy."
113841,ccmtcanada,2007-09-14 16:16:00,7971,Pretty interesting read....for a legal paper...LOL.  Thanks for posting the link.....  Any idea on what the charge was...did it go to court minus the boots as evidence?
113842,Terry,2007-09-14 16:26:00,14456,"yup, Donny just makes up the law as he goes.."
113844,Headhunter,2007-09-14 16:28:00,5703,"Interesting read there... why does it seem that anyone who encounters this C.O. has to some degree, felt that their rights have been trampled? Is this guy a lone wolf solving the world's problems?  Is it that he's located in such a remote area that he feels he can and will do what ever he wants? I have seen far too many examples of his ""approach"" to his job here, that lead me to believe that someone in a position of power, needs to clip this guy's wings. Don't get me wrong, I do want him to do his job and protect the resource, but not at the expense of our rights! They are more important than the resource IMHO. HH"
113848,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-14 16:58:00,957,Donny is blessed with enablers who allow him to go on and on and on.................................. year after year after year..............................  He flirts with entrapment and with fabrication of evidence.  Actually steady dates and sometimes becomes engaged..........
113876,OhioFisherman,2007-09-14 17:59:00,6623,"Hmmm, evidence is thin, I will enter their home illegally and steal some?"
113885,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-14 18:08:00,698,Has anyone ever lodged a formal complaint against this Donny character?
113897,Wes Bender,2007-09-14 18:28:00,105,"""Donny"" isn't the only one. There is a whole friggen pack of them wolves. We have at least one here in TBay area. I am not mentioning names as I fear for my safety..haha But he is a prick and I would love to punch him right in the face!  I NEVER break the law but yet he feels he needs to give me, as well as others, a hard time. I knew sleeping with his daughter in high school was a bad idea.."
113906,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-14 18:54:00,835,If Donny helped cut up and transport an illegally taken moose shouldn't he be charged as well?  If it was some other third person you can bet he would be.
