""That's it"", he tells his wife.  ""I'm giving up golf.  My eyesight has got so bad that once I'd hit the ball I couldn't see where it went."" His wife sympathises and makes him a cup of tea. As they sit down she says, ""Why don't you take my brother with you and give it one more try"". ""That's no good"" sighs Arthur.  ""Your brother's a hundred and three.  He can't help"". ""He may be a hundred and three"", says the wife, ""but his eyesight is perfect."" So the next day Arthur heads off to the golf course with his brother-in-law. He tees up, takes an almighty swing and squints down the fairway.  He turns to the brother-in-law.  ""Did you see the ball?"" ""Of course I did!"" ""Where did it go?"" says Arthur. ""I can't remember""."

On a bar of Dial soap: ""Directions: Use like regular soap."" (and that would be how???....)   On some Swanson frozen dinners: ""Serving suggestion: Defrost."" (but, it's ""just"" a suggestion).  On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom): ""Do not turn upside down."" (well...duh, a bit late, huh)!  On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding: ""Product will be hot after heating."" (...and you thought????...)  On packaging for a Rowenta iron: ""Do not iron clothes on body."" (but wouldn't this save me more time)?  On Nytol Sleep Aid: ""Warning: May cause drowsiness."" (and...I'm taking this because???....)  On most brands of Christmas lights: ""For indoor or outdoor use only."" (as opposed to...what)?  On Sainsbury's peanuts: ""Warning: contains nuts."" (talk about a news flash)  On an American Airlines packet of nuts: ""Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts."" (Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?)  On a child's superman costume: ""Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly."" (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.)"
