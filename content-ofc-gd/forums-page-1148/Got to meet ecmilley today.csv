Don't worrie Ernie the disection will be as painless as I can make it LOL.  We got a chance to chat for a bit and tell a few fishing stories (his are much better than mine) and it was really nice to be able to take a break and get to talk to him. For a young man without a GPS, he sure knows this lake, he was able to tell me about things that don't even show up on the charts (but probably should) and give me some pointers. I in return could only give him some information on what little I know about this lake (not much by comparison).  Anyway Ernie, thanks for the visit and the donations, I hope we'll get a chance to fish together sometime soon."
