It's Dave Mercer's Facts of Fishing for Kids Day. I will be taking the kids there. If you want to check out more about it then check out Ontario Place's website, here's the link http://www.ontarioplace.com/en/events/events.html  All you do is show up with a rod and they supply the rest, even a rod if you don't have one. Also, every child gets a gift just for signing up for the kids fishing derby.  It's from 10-3pm.  If anyone here is going then maybe we could have an OFC meet up. Just suggesting.  Hope to catch some fish and will post pics if we do."
