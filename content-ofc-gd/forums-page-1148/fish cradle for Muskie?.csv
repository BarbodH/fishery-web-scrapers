113493,scuro,2007-09-13 20:55:00,386,I'm determined to catch a Muskie. Do Muskie fishermen use cradles for Muskie or is there a reason that most don't?
113496,linweir,2007-09-13 21:01:00,202,I do have one cradle. I dont use it often. I prefer my frabill net.
113507,lew,2007-09-13 21:19:00,12767,"Cradles are excellent for laying a musky in if you want to get a measurement......see Marc Thorpes many monster pictures.....but they're awkward to operate by yourself, and guide the fish in at the same time.  Large musky nets are easily operated by yourself and also provide a good place to hold the musky in the water while you remove the hooks, plus it allows the fish to recuperate and catch his breath.  Frabill, Beckman and Stowmaster all make excellent products."

I only bought the cardle this year and it has already paid for its self as my first fish of the year was my PB a 50 1/4"" that was very tired and she sat in comfert in my cradle to revive its money well spent if you are chasing musky."
