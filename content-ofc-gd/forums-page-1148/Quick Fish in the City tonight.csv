113273,007,2007-09-13 04:30:00,537,"I decided to spend a couple of hours after work fishing with a friend/colleague.  Headed down to Grenadier Pond by subway from our Bloor/Yonge office.  Started fishing at 6pm, packed up in the dark at 8pm.  Back to basics fishing - light tackle, float and small piece of worm.  We enjoyed pretty constant action from Bluegills and Pumpkinseedfish.  Caught a few nice ones - a good warm up for the walleye and muskies of Pigeon Lake at the weekend LOL  .  On a more serious note - the aim of the evening was really to see if i could cast/fish without too much pain from my ribs following my 'accident' last week bassing at the islands.  Still haven't heard from the doc about the xrays - to say whether I cracked a rib or not.  It was still painful - but I managed to cast for a few hours.  Hopefully will be at least half fit by weekend.  Here's a few pics from tonight.  Good night one and all Mr Bond!        "

Well...not YOUR living room, but my living room....hehe.  Hope the ribs get better soon...fighting a muskie would be rather difficult I imagine!!"
113283,fatherof3,2007-09-13 06:48:00,1769,always good just to get out.Hope your ribs get better soon
113297,mcallister.grant,2007-09-13 10:13:00,327,"Its funny that you post that 007. I have been desperately tring to get my 7 year old son into fishing. First, I brought him to a private pond that I used to go to when I was younger. We were swarmed by horse and deer flys. He hated it. Then I brought him to Grenadier pond thinking that we would at least get some sunfish and low and behold; not a thing. At least you caught something!"
113309,Beans,2007-09-13 10:49:00,3339,Hey Cliff...When 007 hooks up with a muskie the adrenalin rush will kill any pains he has...  Works for me with big carp !!!
113384,ScarSnake,2007-09-13 14:22:00,20,"My chiropractor checked for a cracked rib with a tuning fork. I didn't expect it was cracked, but he wanted to check anyway. He said I would know right away (ie it would hurt!). Stopping by a music shop may be quicker that waiting for x-rays. Not that there's a lot you can do about it anyway.  Cute fish!"
113424,007,2007-09-13 17:19:00,537,Thanks for the comments guys.  Off to get my xray results this afternoon.  Grant - PM sent
113589,007,2007-09-14 01:11:00,537,Good news from the Doc - no broken or cracked ribs - just damaged the muscles.  4 weeks till full recovery but I think I'll be almost fit for fishing this weekend
