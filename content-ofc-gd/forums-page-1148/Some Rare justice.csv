Minh Hung Nguyen, 33, and Minh Thanh Tran, 77, were found guilty and both fined $2,000 for catching and keeping more than the legal limit of yellow perch for Lake Simcoe. The case was tried in Newmarket on Sept. 4. The court heard that on Aug. 19, 2006, Aurora District conservation officers, a deputy conservation officer, and an officer from the York Regional Police Marine Unit observed two men angling from a boat on Lake Simcoe. The two men had several buckets of perch in the boat. When the officers counted the fish, they found the men had 130 yellow perch over the limit.

I have seen everything from over limit to No-Kill rivers where fish are caught and even ducks that have been snagged with trebels and killed to bring home... its sickening"
113511,stuntman,2007-09-13 21:23:00,96,Good job by the conservation and police guys.  How does one catch 130 more than the legal limit?  Certainly not by rod and reel.  Stuntman
113521,issamhay,2007-09-13 21:50:00,77,"not necessarily, if the conditions are good in Simcoe u can catch perch with every cast."
113526,Zib,2007-09-13 21:59:00,369,I'm glad to see they got punished. Too bad they didn't get a nice cattle prod up where the sun don't shine.
113528,TJQ,2007-09-13 22:11:00,7806,Good.....
113537,Sinker,2007-09-13 22:38:00,8692,"I just can't see the justice there. They were charged just over $15/fish.  I know a guy who kept one laker over his limit and got charged over $300.......what gives.  These guys should be banned from fishing for life. And charged enough, that they have to pay for it for the rest of thier lives.  At least they did get caught......most don't.  Sinker"
