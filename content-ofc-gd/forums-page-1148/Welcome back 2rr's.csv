113645,Garry2Rs,2007-09-14 03:20:00,1425,"WOW! It's great to see so many of the original ""names and handles""... Thank you all for your salutations. Yes it was me and Buck at Big Cedar, but we will never mention that name again...E-mail me about hooking up. Now let's get down to it... This is a place for opinions and advice... I have lots and lots on every subject... If you don't like them, that's fine... But, in your heart you know that I'm right... HAHAHA 2R's"
113665,bassmastermike,2007-09-14 05:13:00,295,I dont know you Garry but i hope you feel better soon!
113692,misfish,2007-09-14 11:12:00,29133," As long as your doing the cooking, I,ll believe anything you say."
113694,Bob,2007-09-14 11:22:00,370,"Hey Garry, good to see you back at it.  There are still a few of us old timers around."
113902,aplumma,2007-09-14 18:37:00,6896,welcome back Garry long time no hear.   Art
112997,lew,2007-09-12 14:49:00,12767,"Good to see you posting again Garry, it's been quite awhile"
112998,Roy,2007-09-12 14:55:00,13728,"Yes, it IS nice to see  2R's back for sure. Welcome back Garry. Maybe when you have time you can sing us your version of ""On the Road Again""."
113000,Raf,2007-09-12 15:05:00,3495,Hi Garry!  You must've heard us talkin' about you this wknd.
113001,Garry2Rs,2007-09-12 15:06:00,1425,"Thanks Lew! √çt has been awhile!  I haven't been active on any off the boards for a long time...I guess I had lost interest, but then Chemong Rick was looking for info on Julian Lake, and asked me to bump his thread...that got me started reading some posts...and you know me...I have an oppinion on everything...HAHAHA. How was your Summer?  I hope you caught lots of big toothy critters...grin. I haven't been out for Musky in a long time.  In fact I've pretty well hung-up the Musky gear and switched to lighter Bass tackle.  This time last year I had a heart attack and, with the medication that I'm on, the heavy tackle wears me out too fast...that and being OLD!...grin.  I did get two or three on Jacks by accident, but that was it for me this year. Maybe we could hook-up with Rick sometime and do a little late season fishing... Garry"
113006,lew,2007-09-12 15:19:00,12767,"Sorry to hear about the heart problems Garry, and hopefully they've got everything under contol for you. Your sposed to get sick before you retire, not after  It'd be good to hook up with you & Rick again, we had some fun times together, infact I was cruising up past his place last year and saw him on the dock, and went over and shot the breeze for awhile. Good to see him again too.  Here's  blast from the past for ya.....more fun times  "
113014,Joey,2007-09-12 15:47:00,9122,Nice to see you back Garry  Joey
113021,nelly,2007-09-12 16:07:00,256,Welcome back Garry and hope things are all well now. Take care of your heart and health first. You might also want to try abit of crappie fishing as it is not as stressful once you find them.
113022,douG,2007-09-12 16:11:00,2693,"2RS!!  Welcome back, Garry.  For those 'new' members, within the last three or four years, Garry was the first semipro photographer who posted regularly here.  2RRs, hope to see some more of your fine work soon."
113026,Garry2Rs,2007-09-12 16:21:00,1425,"Thanks All; I'm feeling really good now.  I cut out beer and smokes and generally cleaned up my act. Recently I started a new diet.  I've lost a few pounds, but it remains to be seen if I can keep it off...grin. Anyway I'm fishing more now than I have for the last couple of years, so I think I have more energy than before. 2R's"

113554,JFR,2007-09-13 23:45:00,498,"Welcome back, Garry it is good to know all is now well with you.  Keep up the effort on your heart re-hab and you'll outlive all of us.  John"
