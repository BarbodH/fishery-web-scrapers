112675,GNODDY,2007-09-11 21:56:00,163,Hey guys thinkin of selling my 9.9 whats it worth do you think
112731,Sinker,2007-09-11 23:21:00,8692,Its prolly worth more to you personally.....as a back up....than it is to sell it.  Is it a good runner?  Sinker
112769,addict,2007-09-12 00:41:00,475,priceless
112800,Rizzo,2007-09-12 01:21:00,4754," bingo...just keep it, may come in handy some day.  I wouldn't think anyone would give more than 100-200 bucks for a motor that's older than half the members of this board."
112830,GNODDY,2007-09-12 02:18:00,163,Ya thats what I figured
112943,pikehunter,2007-09-12 12:31:00,1659,Depends on how it runs and the appearance. If it is clean and not abused then it is worth something. Searches for used outboards on the net say that somewhere between 500 and $800. Don't forget that when that motor was new it would have been under a grand. If you can get anything over 300 bucks for it you are doing OK.  If you haven't any use for it why hang onto it? Sell it and put the funds toward some new gear.  I traded in a 70's something 4.5 hp Merc a couple of years ago and they gave me a bit better than 300 or so for it.  If you are selling it for a hundred bucks then guys will be knocking down your door for it! If it runs OK I'll give you a hundred for it and make a buck or 2.  9.9 motors are a hot item!
112952,Rizzo,2007-09-12 12:56:00,4754," that's the point...everyone wants a deal, but nobody is going to pay top dollar for a motor that's over 30 years old (unless its a collectors item).  $100 is low risk potentially high reward - no brainer.  Now find the guy a buyer who would pay significantly more, not so easy."
113002,glen,2007-09-12 15:11:00,2641,In good running condition i would say $400.
113028,BFSC Kevin,2007-09-12 16:41:00,1351,400-500 for it if it is in good running order. $600+ is kind of pushing it.
113175,banger,2007-09-13 00:07:00,95,"I'd say what ever somebody is willing to pay for it.  But if you were to put it, on the back of a 12 foot boat, in the right time of year.You'd get $1200 ish.  just as a motor, around $200.oo to $400.oo."
113397,fishermccann,2007-09-13 15:03:00,655,"I have the same moter . same year it runs great and is priceless to me, for others about 400.00"
113461,boatman,2007-09-13 19:25:00,350,"Condition is everything. The 9.9 Johnson/Evinrude is about the most sought after motor there is. You will have no trouble selling it in the $400-500 price range assuming its in reasonable shape. Top dollar would be $600, but it would have to be in superior condition. $200 would be the bottom. I'd probably list it at $450, but take $400.  I should also add that this is a terrible time to sell an outboard. Lots of buyers looking for an end of season deal, but also lots a motors going cheap. If you list it and can't get your price then hold it until spring. Just as many buyers and motors then, but fewer sellers willing to drop their prices - IMO"
113470,Handlebarz,2007-09-13 19:44:00,3790,last year I bought a 1995 8HP johnson it was only $700 from a dealership with warrenty so ya can go from there. I think if ya were to get $200 or so that would be good but the right person might be a bit more 400-600 if you can get it take it and run
113487,Fisherman,2007-09-13 20:40:00,7201,"More and more people are going for the less stink and more eco friendly 4 strokes too.  Two weeks ago I couldn't believe how far away you can smell that 2 stroke cloud during the Owen sound derby, phew."
