After a little while he gets one on and quickly has his line snap as his reel is kinda messed up and does not let drag out right.Here is a pic of him after losing one.  Time for a new reel for him.I get a hit shortly after and fight is on.This thing took line out like crazy and was really hard to even budge.I couldn't really tell how big it was then as you always get weeds all over your line adding to the weight.When I finally got the fish close enough to shore it came up for the first time I could not believe what I saw.This was a huge fish for this spot.I started freaking a little as I did not want to lose it.I finally got it in and after a few pics it was released to catch again.This was by far my biggest one yet and a ton of fun to catch.Anyway here are the pics.     After seeing that the boy wants to go out and try as much as possible which is fine with me.I know there have been bigger carp on here but I don't think I did too bad with a 6 foot rod,sinkers,hook and some corn,lol.I am officially addicted!"

113898,fatherof3,2007-09-14 18:31:00,1769,"thanks guys,I keep telling him not to worry or get upset about it.It is called fishing not catching after all.I told him the next time we go I will hand my rod over to him when I get one on."
