113584,FinS,2007-09-14 01:04:00,463,just wondering if anyone has ever tried using leeches when fishing for steelhead in the fall i know worms work well but what about leeches????? because i have 6 dozen that i brought back with me from kirkland lake when i was up there in june and they are are still lively as the day i got them i just change the water regularly with spring water and keep em in the fridge

113622,Burtess,2007-09-14 02:20:00,901,"The problem is with leaches and cold water.  By the time steelhead season heats up, the water temps of most flows are in the 50's or lower.  Leaches tend to curl up and become inactive at these temperatures.  I don't know if you will get the action out of them that you can depend on in the summer.  Give them a try and report back though!!  Burt"
