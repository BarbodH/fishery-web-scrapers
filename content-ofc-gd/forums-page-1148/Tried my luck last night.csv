Tossed Mr Cleo for a couple of hours, he's very clean now, however, he is also un-marked!   No bumps, no fish spotted jumpin and no fish observed being caught.  Alas, no pic either! Left at around 10:30... will giver a go again on the weekend. Perhaps try another pier? HH"
113768,ccmtcanada,2007-09-14 13:36:00,7971,Did you put the treble back on?  I hate it when I remember to put it on hours after casting....  I have lots of shiny clean spoons too. haha.

113811,Headhunter,2007-09-14 15:03:00,5703,You bet Gerritt! We'll connect next week to work something out! I've got a few ideas! HH

113819,fishnsled,2007-09-14 15:17:00,3520,Good to hear you got the dirt off the spoons.      Sounds like Gerritt has got some good plans for ya.  Gerritt - I've learned from the master myself.  My avatar speaks of my success from his teachings.

113872,blaque,2007-09-14 17:48:00,2419,"Hello, My name is Rob........and I too am a Spooncleaner.  I was also out last night on the South shores of Ontario (Olcott NY) and i think the paints a little thinner on my spoons from all the retreiving i did , with nothing to show. Bad wind direction and temps though."
113887,Headhunter,2007-09-14 18:12:00,5703,"Forgot to mention in the original posting... spent some time last night before I left the house lookin for my flash light. Well, since we've moved into this house, I have difficulty finding almost anything!LOL Anyway, decided to stop off at CTC on the way and pick up a new one. Picked the floating one as I thought, well, if I mistakenly kick it into the water, no problem. Well, put the battery in it, tried it out, workin fine... yes... my CLeo will glow like a satisfied woman! Used the light to walk out onto the pier, charged my cleo, set the light gently down on the rock and started casting. About 5 casts later, I figure it's time for a re-charge. Nothin, nada, zippo... no light. Set my rod down, take the light apart and back together again... about 10 times... nothin! Well I'm pretty sure the dang thing floats... and since I bought the bright yellow one... does anyone need a channel marker or rock marker! Dang! HH"
