113551,stuntman,2007-09-13 23:38:00,96,"Yeah, this is kinda a dumb question.  I am unable to use the search function for other threads on this because the search terms are too broad, so please bear with me:  I need a net.  A long handled net for fishing salmon and trout off of the southern Ontario piers; Oshawa, Port Hope etc. and I dont know:  -Most nets have 48"" handles and that seems to short to me.  how long the handle should be? -How small is too small for the net opening?  It would really stink catching a fish with only a useless net to bring it up with.  Any help?  Stuntman"
113552,ccmtcanada,2007-09-13 23:40:00,7971,We have a net that we bought at BPS....I believe the opening is 30 inches and the handle extends to 8 feet...perfect for pier fishing at any pier I've seen
113564,Sinker,2007-09-14 00:15:00,8692,"Yup, you need at least 8ft for it to be a worthwhile purchase.  I was a on a pier last night, and my 7 ft rod couldn't touch the water!!  I have an 8 footer, with a 5 foot extension  Sinker"
113570,stuntman,2007-09-14 00:39:00,96,"OK....8ft handle (plus net dimensions). check!  make sure I can add an extension laster.  check!  Any particular brand name, is it important?  Stuntman"
113572,Fisherman,2007-09-14 00:45:00,7201,"Yes, the brand is important, from personal experience, stay away from the Frabil junk. I have the ex large one from Ranger, it has the 8' telescoping handle that slides down to 4' inside the hoop of the net."
113637,Garry2Rs,2007-09-14 03:02:00,1425,"What you're looking for is a Beckman's Fish Pen Landing Net. This sucker is big enough to land a steer!  The bottom is flat, so it forms a pen.  You can take your time finding your tools and unhook your toothy critter in the water and release it with minimum stress.. Garry2r's"
113643,Dondorfish,2007-09-14 03:15:00,1000,   That sounds interesting - any idea how much and where one would find one?   Don
113673,Roy,2007-09-14 06:07:00,13728," I use a Frabill Kwik Kradle for muskie, a fine net bottom, excellent construction, and certainly not cheap. My walleye net is a Frabill Tru-trax with an 8' handle and powerlock system. They'll both last me my lifetime for sure."
