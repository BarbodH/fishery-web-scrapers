Abitibi has been chosen as a priority for the province and a little hamlet called Clova has been left to mother nature. Clova is the jump off point for Air Tamarac, https://tamarac.ca. I was there about four years ago, the 300 km logging road in was a grind, but the facilities and fishing was fantastic. It is a family run business and I am hoping that the fire misses them as it would devastate them. Good thoughts to the folks in Clova! HH"
