It will be a bass,panfish and pike tie combination . I have the bass and panfish baits covered and working on a pike one . A 6"" dragon tail . A bit of a challenge,but I will have it down come the 17th, I hope.  Now I wonder if they will allow to have a cold one,while tying at the table ?"
1085549,ketchenany,2023-05-31 17:33:00,3229,Get yourself the biggest Tim you can find and fill it with cold one or one of these! You are becoming a tying star.

I had thought this would be in the club room were there would be like, 20-30 or so people. Well to my surprise,this will be held out on the open floor in the fishing section. Ya,nothing like having every walker by watching. Best have my game face on for this now. OH ME NERVES ."

1085612,akaShag,2023-06-05 23:25:00,2073,"Many moons ago I gave a presentation about fishing to a pretty big crowd, who got time off from work to attend the thing.  (It was one of those ""team building"" things that people put on back in the 90s.)  Not everybody was all that interested in fishing, and I realized that before the event.  So yes indeed I had a thermos there with some ""TEA"" in it that was actually rye and water......😉 Doug"
