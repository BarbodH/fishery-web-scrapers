1085840,Fisherman,2023-06-21 18:17:00,7201,"Well there's no ""scratching my head"" emoji, invasive what."
1085842,Terry,2023-06-21 18:39:00,14456,I assume pike as that was the only fish mentioned
1085844,Headhunter,2023-06-21 18:50:00,5703,Invasive puke would leave a nasty scum... and smell! HH
1085845,Spiel,2023-06-21 22:06:00,9065,"I concur wholeheartedly. I have no idea how one would go about cleaning and filleting ""puke.""Â Â Â Â  ðŸ¤£"
1085846,Headhunter,2023-06-21 22:20:00,5703,Chunks I would imagine... HH
1085848,AKRISONER,2023-06-21 22:36:00,5558,Interestingly some of the greasy junk I fish in the kawarthas flipping for largemouth would fit the bill
