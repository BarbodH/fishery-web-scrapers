1070767,PUMP KNOWS,2021-02-25 01:07:00,937,Just a heads up to you tackle junkies who are looking for cheap tackle treys to store your lures and tackle.  Dollarama is selling these new tackle treys for $4. They’re similar to the Plano 3700 and the latches on these are very solid.  I recently picked up a bunch of used lures and just had them organized.

Also look for braid fishing line at Dollarama as they start to pull out there summer stuff. I found it in 15 and 20 lb 150m spools I bought a few spools last summer to check it out and it worked fine. I think it was $4 and grey colour."
1070770,SirCranksalot,2021-02-25 01:43:00,3291,I have a couple of those but the latches are quite difficult to release. 
1070771,PUMP KNOWS,2021-02-25 01:51:00,937,Would you happen to know the brand of the braid?  I remember seeing them last year but I passed.  I just stick with power pro.  They can be found on sale for 30% off and even 50%. I bought a huge lot of lures last weekend and these are the ones I’ve kept for my stash.  The mepps spoon is pretty sweet.  I have the Firetiger version and the action is pretty sweet.  this was my first time seeing these treys.  I’m gonna use them for storage and use my Plano boxes when I’m out fishing
