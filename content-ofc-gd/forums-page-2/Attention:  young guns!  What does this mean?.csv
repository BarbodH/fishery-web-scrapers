Thanks for helping out an old fart. Doug"
1085680,Terry,2023-06-13 01:22:00,14456,"Yes, you did not need the updates if you donâ€™t want them and you can still use the card for all functions you already have however you may want to see if there are any free updates that are av today and update it if there are"
1085683,KraTToR,2023-06-13 11:00:00,506,"Not a ""Young gun"" but Terry is correct. Your card will still work as it always has, you'll miss out on any updates going forward. I usually renew every 3-4 years but lets face it, the bathymetry really doesn't change that much "
1085686,Terry,2023-06-13 11:23:00,14456,"Im well over 65 myself, but still consider myself a young gun  lol"
1085687,CrowMan,2023-06-13 12:18:00,413,Agree with the above...but just learned something...Navionics is based in Italy. Who knew.
1085688,akaShag,2023-06-13 13:11:00,2073,"Thanks guys!Â  The idea of having to do a bunch of buttonology just before bass season filled me with dread.Â  So I will stay with what I have.Â  And unless somebody moves the shoals, I am OK. Doug"
1085689,BillM,2023-06-13 15:17:00,17367,Hydrocharts don't change all that much.Â  If you've got current updates you're good.
1085692,akaShag,2023-06-13 17:16:00,2073,How would I know?Â  Do they update automatically?Â  Thanks for the advice!  	Doug
1085693,BillM,2023-06-13 17:53:00,17367,"No, you'd plug your card into your laptop, the Navionics app would pop up and it would tell you to update them.Â  Do that before your subscription is over."
1085694,akaShag,2023-06-13 17:58:00,2073,Many thanks!Â  IIRC it was you who showed me (with a photo on here) how to find the teeny little slot where the card fits.Â  I am going to look for that right soon! Doug
1085698,akaShag,2023-06-13 21:12:00,2073,"OK, we have success!Â  With the aid of a set of ""cheaters"" (I don't wear glasses), and a bright flashlight and a set of needle nose pliers I was able to get the micro mini teeny weeny yellow polka dot bikini SD card out of the clever hiding place and got it updated.Â  Hallelujah! Hopefully I can also put it back. Thanks for all the helpful advice! I think I need to hire one of you folks for a morning to teach me how to use my Helix..........ðŸ™„ Doug"
1085700,CrowMan,2023-06-13 21:21:00,413,"I think I need to hire one of you folks for a morning to teach me how to use my Helix..........ðŸ™„   Hey Doug....next time we're out, I'll do a little more show & tell. We were probably too busy with the Crappies and yakking about everything elseÂ  to spend any time in class.. Just remember, keep pressing ""VIEW"" until you see the screen the way you like it...ðŸ˜‰"
1085704,akaShag,2023-06-13 22:47:00,2073,"SOLD!!!Â  I got to thinking (which is a dangerous activity for a man like me), and I realize that I spend very little of my time at the stern of the boat where I have the graph, and rather spend most time on the bow casting platform with the bow-mount electric.Â  I already knew why guys have two (or more) graphs, but did not really want to have something else up front in the way.Â  So I do not actually spend much time looking at the graph and learning how it works. The last time I REALLY understand my graphs, it was a Lowrance X-16 (paper) in the boat, and a Lowrance Z-6000P portable everywhere else.Â  I really did understand them.Â  But I also wore a younger man's clothes.............and my head wasn't full of all the KNOWLEDGE from the last 30 or 40 years. ðŸ™„ Doug"
1085705,CrowMan,2023-06-13 23:00:00,413,"That explains a lot...even though you were sitting on the bow casting platform, you didn't want to turn on the Helix I have mounted up front...but if you're catching fish...who cares...lol"
1085706,wkrp,2023-06-14 00:02:00,656,You nailed it AKA
1085707,dave524,2023-06-14 03:00:00,4508,Bet you would be surprised how old most of the data is
1085715,akaShag,2023-06-14 13:49:00,2073,"When I used to use paper charts, literally all over the province as far north as Temagami, the data was often from decades earlier.Â  I am guessing that some of that data has never been updated, due to the work involved. Doug"
1085717,Terry,2023-06-14 14:47:00,14456,"Yeah, Temagami maps suck not even close"
1085720,BillM,2023-06-14 15:47:00,17367,"Not surprised at all, where do you think they got the data from?Â  The original hydro charts, lol! Any spots I fish with any frequency I just turn on Autochart Live and make my own maps anyhow."
1085760,Dan668,2023-06-16 13:40:00,1120,"Charts don't change much, but for Lowrance users, you lose the advanced map options which is helpful for highlighting a single range and shallow water. Sucks to renew yearly. Might try C Maps although from looking at there viewer online, Navionics seems to superior."
1085761,BillM,2023-06-16 17:15:00,17367,Buddy of mine just upgraded to C-maps for the ability to highlight certain depths etc.Â  Â You'd think a feature like that would be standard...Â  Yikes.
