1085671,KraTToR,2023-06-12 12:12:00,506,"I follow the Longpoint forum to see where the 'eyes are showing up. Went out yesterday and started in 40 FOW ended up with 2 farm animals (Sheephead) on a harness. Motored out to deeper water (55 +/-) and picked up 4 eyes in a matter of an hour. 1 dink and the others ranged from 3-5lbs. All on a ""0"" dipsey set to 1, 110 feet back on a blk/copper and silver/blue spoons. Nothing on RRF. Anyone interested in limits of 'eyes, let me know and I'll be happy to help. "
