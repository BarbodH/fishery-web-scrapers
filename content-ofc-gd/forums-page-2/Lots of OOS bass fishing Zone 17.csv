Theres a reason we have the best bass fishing on the entire planet without question. People will tell themselves what they want to think is right, no amount of studies/science is going to convince them otherwise. The funniest part is in texas they finally introduced strict slot limits to at least curb guys boxing spawning fish, sure enough texas in part with its share lunker program is absolutely taking off while the entirety of the rest of the country is literally falling.

You aren‚Äôt going to see many tournaments won throwing a frog or buzz bait. Up north it‚Äôs a heck of a lot of using floggers with hair jigs and drop shots.  down south it‚Äôs become a lot of throwing baits into brush piles using your forward facing sonar. It doesn‚Äôt make for great tv. gussy‚Äôs win at the classic basically gave everyone an aneurism, cap that with how decimated the fisheries in the south are becoming with every increasing tournament pressure and bed raping the fisheries, plus mix in a little herbicide spraying (I still can‚Äôt believe this stuff goes on‚Äù things are getting really ugly."
1085811,OhioFisherman,2023-06-20 19:50:00,6623,"Never was much of a fan of fishing for bedding fish, and even doing it for bluegill or crappie can harm the population without some limits and controls. Bother it until it bites?"

Sure enough I didn‚Äôt have my physical card on me, but I always keep my license summary on my phone‚Ä¶so I thought turns out I only had photos of the front and back of my physical license and my license summary was of my older license that‚Äôs since expired. The CO was really good about it though. I think sometimes you get a little bit of the benefit of the doubt If you look like you at least know what you are doing out there a bit. was good to finally confirm with a CO though that a pdf of your license summary saved to your phone is considered to be valid. I always have such a hard time keeping track of my physical license because between fishing rivers, ice fishing, fishing in my boat and others, it‚Äôs much easier to just have it on my phone. They checked my live wells which were empty, and seeing me release that bass, we didn‚Äôt seem suspicious. Clearly a couple guys with 15 rods out all over the boat catching and releasing bass.  the co couldn‚Äôt have been much over 35 years old, good to see some young guys joining the force.

A few days ago some clowns were bouncing baits off my dock and shoreline, as I'm sitting there.¬† When they caught a Bass they even posed and took photos of it. When I called them out on it, their response was ""don't worry, it's cool dude, we're all catch and release"". I tried to explain to them that the males are guarding the nest, and pulling them off even for a few seconds allows other fish to gobble up the fry. They argued with me, then eventually gave me the finger, and took off..

1085690,BillM,2023-06-13 15:19:00,17367,People are idiots.¬† ¬† I ran across a glitter boat on Lower Buck last weekend during musky opener tossing spinnerbaits right up close.
1085691,AKRISONER,2023-06-13 16:26:00,5558,"Same ish different year. I usually go for a boat ride on the Friday of opener just to see how things are shaping up, check water temps and without fail every time I see guys beating the bank with spinner baits"
1085699,akaShag,2023-06-13 21:19:00,2073,"Friday before opener most years on Loughborough, lots of folks obviously fishing for bass.¬† When challenged, most claim to be fishing for pike.¬† Yeah, right.¬† Often the boats have out of province registrations, or they are rental boats from the marina.¬† But lots of Ontario stickers, and sometimes guys in serious bass boats (which never fails to surprise me).¬† We do not have nearly enough COs in this province.... Doug"
1085708,RandyLinden,2023-06-14 11:56:00,40,"Part of the problem is that it is difficult to prove what someone is fishing for. If a CO see's someone tossing a spinnerbait and the angler claims he's fishing for pike, was there a regulation broken? It's hard to prove intent and all too often there is no real proof or evidence. There are also many anglers that do not know about lures and the types to use along with very little knowledge about the habitat, biology and spawning cycles of various species that the regulations are based on. I have a cottage on Loughborough lake and have watched and reported a number of obvious offenders but it is difficult to prove. The only successful intervention occurred when an out of province angler was actually putting large mouth bass in his live well. As an early season Crappie guy with a serious bass glitter boat I get hassled and accused of bass fishing constantly, to the point that it's no longer an enjoyable activity. I understand the challenges and actions from concerned folks watching out but it's equally important to understand that not every angler is out there hammering out of season fish. More information and education is required but as long as it is legal to catch some species while other species are out of season I feel that this problem will just continue and it becomes a matter of personal ethics to go fishing at this time of the year."
1085709,porkpie,2023-06-14 12:53:00,2521,"Yeah, I hear ya every year people accuse us of bass fishing in the spring from a distance in pad beds. ¬†Yelling out ‚Äúbass is closed‚Äù.

1085710,lew,2023-06-14 13:00:00,12766,"I never had any interest at all in bass fishing and fished musky almost exclusively for decades and a very successful tactic in the very early season was throwing smallish spinnerbaits into shallow water pencil reeds which was also a favorite haunt of largemouth bass.

The same guy will keep catching and releasing the exact same fish to the point that it's exhausted and can no longer defend the nest. The fish aren't even eating...how much skill or talent is there in pulling fish off the beds, or the knowledge required in bait selection or presentation... And don't get me started on the floggers...specifically used to find fish on the beds. 1000's of $$$ of electronics on the boat and it comes down to a plastic cone with a piece of glass in it....please.
