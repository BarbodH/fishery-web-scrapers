1085411,Barry Willis,2023-05-23 19:47:00,180,"Awesome job as usual misfish. They appear, to be dragonflies. You'll have no problem catching bass with them. Looking forward to some pics or videos of the action they create."
1085427,Gil Levesque,2023-05-24 11:18:00,103,"Great looking flies bud. Heres a few of my bass fly ties.   First is the gutless frog, next tube clouser minnows, next perch clousers for pike, then the foam plipper,a popper with a lip! Last is the Shuffler . A foam fly from an australian design.  Totally weedless and an awsome swiming action! Cheers"

1085435,Barry Willis,2023-05-24 14:18:00,180,"Seeing your dragon flies reminds me of a time I was fishing for large mouth up at Stokes Bay and noticed  two large dragonflies on some reeds about eight feet in front of me (I was wading) We had a heavy dew that night and their wings hadn't dried out so they could fly. A couple minutes later a big large mouth came out of the water and picked one off the reed, a few seconds later it came back and grabbed the other one. It was something to see especially that close. That was the same day I caught my 8.5lb large mouth on a big hula popper. Out of all the ones I caught that day the smallest was 4lb. all on the surface in thick lily pads."
