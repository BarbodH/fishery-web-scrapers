He sent me a post from the Outfitter on what was a common tie for up there.  I came up with some variant beaded Nats and Hares ears which were on the list,but he was happy with the out come and I sent them off to him this morning. Looking forward to pics when he returns.   I,ll be on the local streams Friday, fishing for browns."
