1085601,glen,2023-06-04 19:27:00,2641,Is a quicksilver steering system any good? It is stuck. Is it worth while to unstick it? Can I get it working good again? 	I see new steering wheel and cable is about $300.   	also I want a new console. The one I’m using is too small.  Store bought look to be about $500. it would be nice to have aluminum. But it would be easier to build out of wood.  I plan on putting a glove box in it.  I wonder if boat recyclers would have what I need.   	Any thoughts welcome.
1085602,aplumma,2023-06-04 21:36:00,6896,I replaced my cables with this unit which was really much easier than trying to feed the cables through the chase. It has no feedback and has performed flawlessly for 8 years now. It also will allow you to vary the length of the run so it fits perfectly. Once a cable goes stiff it is because it is full of bits of rust and frayed cable. You can lubricate it temporarily but when it breaks it is a long trip back to the dock.    https://www.westmarine.com/dometic-baystar-outboard-steering-system-3400934.html  cheers Art

And 36” high. something like this only bigger. im looking at this for steering.    https://www.vevor.ca/boat-steering-kit-c_11482/marine-engine-turbine-rotary-steering-system-10ft-ss13710-boat-cable-with-wheel-p_010706461326

1085646,glen,2023-06-10 13:36:00,2641,Steering cable is no good.  So I’m going to get the one I posted.  I can’t find a console under 600 so I’m going to build one.  I need two seat pedestals some plywood and foam.
1085647,CrowMan,2023-06-10 14:01:00,413,I assume you tried these guys: https://kawarthaboatwrecking.com/
1085648,glen,2023-06-10 16:07:00,2641,I think the console will be better if i build it because I’ll get what I want.   	the steering system i posted is ok $ wise if it works good.  	the pedestals are about 100 each but I should be able to find them.   	just starting on the foam now.
