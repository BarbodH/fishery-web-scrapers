1085863,Freshtrax,2023-06-23 03:07:00,2215,"Time again for the annual  fishing trip.   One problem,  one of the OG members moved to New Brunswick.  He was  going to fly out and ride up.  Then he got a new job and he was out. Then he was back in again, said boss was cool with it.   2 weeks out we all get the message he can't make it.    What to do... I have a few maniac fishing buddies who may be able to drop what they are doing and leave for a 10 day trip at a week's notice so I start calling.   The first one I called was a strike out but provided a promising lead.  Chuckenwind from the board here.  We had camped and  fished once previous for a few days for some lost Aurora trout in a snowstorm , he seemed possibly just crazy enough.  I  Sent him a message explaining the trip and his reply was "" crossing Nipigon in a 14 ft boat sounds like an adventure, I'm in ""    *I in no way reccomend doing this*  Almost died on the way up, came over a knoll in the road and big dumb Moose was standing in the road.  Put the binders on as hard as i could and steered off the road and arround him at 50kmh close enough to hear his hoves on the ashphalt.  Not so much fun loaded down with gear and a 20 ft boat attached to the bumper.   Fishing was tougher than years prior for Brookies and Pike   for us  but 10 lb lakers in 10 -20 fow were in unlimited supply as usual and a blast on light tackle .  Had a great trip with Some old friends and my Dad.   Was weird with no campfires allot less whisky was drank but did have to do a beer run mid week with the warmer weather we were all thirsty.  Enough talking  here's some of the better fish and scenery.  Till next year!                                    "

1085913,AKRISONER,2023-06-26 16:22:00,5558,"Looks like you couldn’t have asked for better weather. great report, looked like a blast"
1085915,CrowMan,2023-06-26 17:10:00,413,Yeah...not often you see that inland sea look like a mill pond. Looks like good times and nice fish ! Thanks for posting.
1085942,ckewley,2023-06-28 12:05:00,699,Really kicking my own ass for not being able to go but there will always be other years!! Looks like a great time was had by all
1085943,bigcreekdad,2023-06-28 13:06:00,546,Curious...does the no fire thing mean no fish cooking? That would be tough to take. Regardless...great post and looks like a wonderful trip! 
1085945,CrowMan,2023-06-28 13:28:00,413,"As far as I know, even though there is a fire ban you can still use a camp stove...gas or liquid fuel. I think the rule is ...as long as what you use has a valve to turn it off"
1085952,Chuck Enwinde,2023-06-29 12:35:00,247,Thanks again for having me along.  That was awesome.  We fried up some walleyes on the Coleman stove.  Not many eyes in the area we were camped but we had a tip from a board member about a spot nearby that had them.  40km round trip is considered nearby on Nipigon lol.  Trip of a lifetime to be sure and grateful to experience it with some very capable boat captains and great guys.  
1085954,Freshtrax,2023-06-29 14:27:00,2215,Was a great trip thanks for joining worked out great.  Yea we got 3 flat days to run about we usualy only get 2   When its choppy we put the smaller Boat in the big boats wake and go slow.  But usually just tuck in out of the wind  not much you can do on that lake.
1085955,BassMan11,2023-06-29 14:28:00,583,Awesome report and a heck of an adventure. Thanks for posting
