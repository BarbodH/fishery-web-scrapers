1085727,glen,2023-06-15 17:22:00,2641,I’m thinking about mounting the fish finder closer to my eyes while I’m driving the boat.  The top of the console is too far away. It doesn’t make sense to have to lean in to press buttons.   	ram mounts? Or ?  	thanks for any help.
1085732,CrowMan,2023-06-15 18:52:00,413,"I have all my units on Ram mounts...allows for the ultimate flexibility in positioning, and easy to fold away for traveling."
1085744,craigdritchie,2023-06-15 21:22:00,1586,"I'm a HUGE fan of Geigertec mounts. They're hand-made in Aurora, Ontario to an absolutely insane quality standard by people who actually fish. The guy who runs it (Tim Fernandes) is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. Website is https://www.geigertecmarine.com I like to support Canadian companies whenever I can, but flag waving aside, these really are the highest quality mounts I've ever seen - bar none. Yes, they're expensive and yes, pricing on the website is in USD ... which reflects the fact that's where 95% of their customers are located. BUT ... these brackets will last a lifetime and you'll never worry about having an expensive display bounce around in rough water, or detach altogether (as I had happen a few years back with another bracket). They really are as good as it gets."
1085763,BillM,2023-06-16 18:30:00,17367,"Yup, Geigertec mounts if you've got the $$$.  Rock solid."
1085764,Cosmos,2023-06-16 20:29:00,588,Awesome mounts. Have one for my finder. Quality is unbelievable.
1085765,Terry,2023-06-16 20:54:00,14456,I’m not a huge fan of Holly crap that’s a lot of money for a bracket
1085783,KraTToR,2023-06-19 15:46:00,506,"Agreed, but they are not mass produced or anything like that.  RAM mounts work well enough but your graph will start to droop on rough water where as the Geigertec will not. If you go for a RAM, I recommend the mount with the larger ball.  This is what you need: https://www.radioworld.ca/ram-d111uc and https://www.radioworld.ca/ram-rap402u  "
1085784,CrowMan,2023-06-19 15:56:00,413,"Quick and easy hack for Ram mounts...rough up the ball and socket with some medium grit sandpaper, and keep clean with some rubbing alcohol every once in a while...stops any slipping"
1085786,Terry,2023-06-19 16:58:00,14456,I recommend https://kbmoutdoors.ca/products/ram®-horizontal-6-swing-arm-mount-for-fishfinders-plotters-109hu?variant=44361106784534&currency=CAD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_campaign=gs-2019-02-05&utm_source=google&utm_medium=smart_campaign&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw-b-kBhB-EiwA4fvKrDyYT-x3BFJswbOxxI8ABK_5Q2mI4tcH9vsOrhYl2gW2ODCxE4EmjxoCvycQAvD_BwE 
1085788,BillM,2023-06-19 18:19:00,17367,"No vertical adjustment.  Dunno how many guys that would work for.   I know it wouldn't work for me.   I've got my Helix 12 on the biggest ram mount, I'm actually going to sand the 'balls' later today.   Great tip Crowman!   lol"
1085789,AKRISONER,2023-06-19 20:30:00,5558,I need to try this out…my second graph on the front of my boat droops into my other screen up on the bow when I hit anything too hard going fast.
1085792,CrowMan,2023-06-19 20:45:00,413,You want to etch up the plastic pretty good...60 grit Emery Cloth solved the problem for me
1085865,Freshtrax,2023-06-23 04:45:00,2215,Never thought of this .  Im  Going to scratch up my balls lol.  We run a helix 10 on a big ram mount will  droop when taking a pounding. Thanks!
