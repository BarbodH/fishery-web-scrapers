1085730,CrowMan,2023-06-15 18:43:00,413,"A little history for the young guns (and reminiscing for the old farts)...how the terminology for the species has changed here in Ontario. The ""Ontario Fishing Regulations"" from 1960....what the gov't called them back¬†then: ""YELLOW PICKEREL (Dore, Pike-Perch, Walleye-Pike)"" ""PIKE (Great Northern Pike and Grass Pike)"" ""SPECKLED TROUT"" ""BLACK BASS"" ""MASKINONGE"" Those are the terms I grew up with....the Ontario regs changed the names to Walleye, Northern Pike, Brook Trout, Smallmouth, Largemouth and Muskellunge, I believe sometime in the late 70's. ...and looking at the photo, it seems folks¬†¬†kept and ate Musky...lol "
1085734,dave524,2023-06-15 19:07:00,4508,The name Walleye didn't become common here till we started watching American fishing shows. Never heard it before about 1970.
1085737,CrowMan,2023-06-15 19:18:00,413,On another note...the reg's were a lot simpler back then...a one page tri-fold. Today it's a 143 page (I just counted) novel... Which can be interpreted as a political comment too...government just keeps getting bigger and bigger..
1085739,Cast-Away,2023-06-15 20:17:00,790,"I remember on the In Fisherman Al Lindner referred to a Rapela as a ""Wrapalah""."
1085740,Spiel,2023-06-15 20:32:00,9065,"To add to the confusion they still refer to Brookies and Lakers as trout, they're not.  	And further more, Walleye are not Pickerel even though I grew thinking they were.¬† üòÜ"
1085741,Spiel,2023-06-15 20:42:00,9065,"And ya, ""Black Bass"" was also a familiar term from youth."
1085742,CrowMan,2023-06-15 20:47:00,413,"My in-laws (of all ages), in the Niagara area, to this day still call them ""Black Bass""..."
1085743,CrowMan,2023-06-15 20:51:00,413,"My Dad and his fishing buddies would call any small (hammer-handle) Pike a ""Grass Pike""...and anything over say 30"" was a ""Northern Pike""."
1085747,John Bacon,2023-06-15 22:33:00,3277,I think that's the proper pronunciation.¬† Listen to their commercials.
1085748,Barry Willis,2023-06-15 22:46:00,180,"There are still some anglers that call Walleye, Pickerel.¬† I remember back in the 60's my Dad showing me the difference between Pike, Pickerel and Walleye, and yes he did call the hammer handles Grass Pike."
1085749,Barry Willis,2023-06-15 23:13:00,180,"Haha, I just thought of another one, my Dad and a couple of his buddy's showed me and that is - Chain Pickerel."
1085751,akaShag,2023-06-15 23:31:00,2073,Darryl Choronzey took this on as a crusade.¬† He convinced me......... Doug

1085756,Beans,2023-06-16 00:32:00,3339,The name Walleye didn't become common here till we started watching American fishing shows  My grand pappy called them pickerel...Dad called them pickerel...I call them pickerel... my sons call them pickerel...my grandson calls them pickerel and his son will probably call them pickerel...Long live the name pickerel !!!l

1085762,BillM,2023-06-16 17:29:00,17367,My oldman still saying pickerel
1085793,AKRISONER,2023-06-19 20:46:00,5558,"The colloquialism is strong in Ontario. Basically anywhere north of muskoka they are still pickerel. It‚Äôs only once you get too close to the border people start saying walleye. I can assure you that the pickerel river is not named after the chain variety lol  	If you really want to confuse Americans, we tell them that we fry up pickerel and they are lossstttt lol here‚Äôs one of my favourites, in Manitoba pike are called jack fish."
1085804,Cast-Away,2023-06-20 15:44:00,790,"So in Manitoba they know ""Jack"" right!"
1085806,AKRISONER,2023-06-20 17:21:00,5558,"Funny I‚Äôm thinking back now and I realize talking to some old timers, they referenced grass pike as well, I‚Äôd never heard that before. when I moved to Ontario I‚Äôd never heard of a ‚Äúpike‚Äù in fact I think I probably didn‚Äôt start using the term until I started fishing with my friends regularly here in Ontario. My old man still calls em a jack. im glad I started fishing more with my friend Zac. He prior to fishing with me did more of his fishing for pickerel up near timmins, so I‚Äôve gotten away from calling them walleye again. It‚Äôs back to pickerel, and I‚Äôm happy to not use American terminology"
1085807,akaShag,2023-06-20 17:28:00,2073,"You might call a Chevrolet a Chevy, or call a GMC a Jimmy, but there are actual names, and names in common usage.¬† Who cares?"
1085813,Dave Bailey,2023-06-20 20:52:00,1641," But so does the population, the road system, and the consequent pressure on fish. Add to that better research and science on management, and things change. We still have it good."
