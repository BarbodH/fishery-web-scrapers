Left the pickeral alone and drove around looking for pike.. lol.. took us an hour to get 300m from camp... even had a double header at one point. Then back for wings and a nice warm fire and movie!! I even let her beat me at cribbage. Also had , at one point, 6 golden eagles hunting over camp, we usually see them in pairs, so that was something I've never seen before. Probably about a 5 foot wingspan. Rainy day today so a good day to sit by the fire and read.. get some quiet time in. Oh.. and no more wondering whats going on at camp when were not there. Got this handy camera to keep an eye on things while were gone. One tiny bar but it works like a charm! Even managed a couple small pickeral the evening before to have for breakfast. Place is full of smaller pickeral... even after 15 years here I cant for the life of me find the bigger ones...            "
