1085501,kickingfrog,2023-05-28 16:40:00,8333,Checking my trolling motor battery today and noticed some corrosion that I wanted to clean up. What I’m wondering is what is this little black box that is on the connection? 
1085502,kickingfrog,2023-05-28 17:27:00,8333,Figured it is a fuse. Now I'm wondering what amps a replacement should be.
1085503,porkpie,2023-05-28 17:41:00,2521,"Circuit breaker, I'd recommend a minimum of 60amp.  Princess auto sells them, but I've occasionally had trouble with the cheap ones.  I generally spring for a minn kota branded one when it's time to replace."
1085504,kickingfrog,2023-05-28 18:06:00,8333,There's nothing it to indicate what size it is. I can find lots up to 50 amps. I might just clean this one up for now and keep looking.

1085506,Terry,2023-05-28 21:25:00,14456,Looks like a thermos block to me so it’s a breaker if it gets too hot
1085507,kickingfrog,2023-05-28 21:59:00,8333,It's a Mini Kota with 40lb of thrust.
1085508,SlipperyVic,2023-05-28 23:16:00,11,"It's a self resetting circuit breaker. The breaker is sized for the wiring it protect. The wiring is sized depending on the size of the load, and the length of the wire.  What sized motor and wire are you dealing with? "

1085523,bdox,2023-05-30 14:35:00,329,You should be good with a 50 amp breaker if it's only 40lb thrust.  https://minnkota.johnsonoutdoors.com/us/support/trolling-motor-installation-guides/trolling-motor-wiring-and-battery-guide
1085542,Lape0019,2023-05-31 16:53:00,647,"Had one of those on my Tour 46lb that came on my bass tracker. If i remember right, it was on 8awg wire and was rated for 40amp."
1085543,KraTToR,2023-05-31 17:20:00,506,Its an inline fuse. Replace it with a circuit breaker. Guidelines below:
