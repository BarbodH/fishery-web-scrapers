1085657,Beans,2023-06-11 13:54:00,3339,"For crappie and bass on your lake I usually do tail down as they are mostly looking up for bait...Pickerel, I do tail up as they are usually at the bottom and if the tail is down it would just drag on the bottom giving it no action...Under a bobber, either way..."
1085663,TJQ,2023-06-11 16:59:00,7806,That is far to specific  lol
