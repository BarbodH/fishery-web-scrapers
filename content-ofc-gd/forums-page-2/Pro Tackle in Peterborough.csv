1085701,Weeds,2023-06-13 21:30:00,782,I’d never been in till about a week ago too which is funny cause I live just around the corner. Was looking for Kalins Grubs which apparently they don’t carry but it was almost overwhelming the amount of other stuff they did stock.  I don’t recall seeing any Mepps stuff either. Might just have not seen it.
