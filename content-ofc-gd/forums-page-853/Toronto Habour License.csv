338744,lunders,2009-05-06 15:45:00,33,You need a license to operate a powerboat within the Toronto outer/inner harbour. It's called Toronto Port Authority Power Vessel Operator Permit.  It seems like a money pit for the city... Has to be renewed yearly.  I signed up to take my test with Humber Sailing & Powerboating Centre. Total cost is $ 75.
338748,Fishing4Tails,2009-05-06 16:17:00,38,"They do check once in a while ... Watch your speed and stay away from the island airport on west end are the most important rules.. Fine go up to $10,000 so better to get your harbour pass!!! The test is easy but time consuming .. Pretty sure area is bigger than most people think its from western gap all the way east to leslie spit including ashbridges bay .. Harbour pass is mosly enforced near ferrys and airport.                                               Cheers"
338769,lunders,2009-05-06 17:36:00,33,"BTW, Harbour limits are as follows:  West: A line extending one mile into the lake south from the Humber river South: A line extending one mile into the lake south from Gibraltar Point East: A line extending one mile into the lake south from the eastern boundary of the old city of Toronto, at Victoria Park.  Area immediately adjacent to the east and west of the main runway at Island airport is a no go...  Speed limits are 10 knots and 5 knots. (5 within 150 metres of any shoreline or breakwater.)"
