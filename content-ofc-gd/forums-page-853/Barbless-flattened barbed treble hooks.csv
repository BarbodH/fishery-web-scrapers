338087,ben306,2009-05-04 19:00:00,59,"How many of you flatten the barbs/ use barbless trebles on your lures?  Ive seen a number of people get trebles stuck in hands and what not and had major issues trying to remove them, aswell as making unhooking fish much faster and safer."
338089,JohnF,2009-05-04 19:02:00,3494," Most of mine are squashed, and I've been happy about it at least a couple of times.  JF"
338093,BillM,2009-05-04 19:08:00,17367,"Only when I am small stream trout fishing.  Other then that, I don't pinch my barbs unless the regs state that I need to."
338098,muskeybugged,2009-05-04 19:27:00,282,"I love the Idea and do it every time I go out when I'm not looking for Muskies - I don't want to wait another 10, 000 cast, as I get better/luckier at the whole musky thing I'd consider it then too. It made getting pesky blue gills of the hook in a jiffy, and left more time for crappies the last 2 days."
338110,fish-miester,2009-05-04 19:45:00,864,"honestly i pinch the barbs on most of my musky baits .. we catch so many even with the barbs closed big or small.. doesnt seem to effect it really .. i mainly do this because i like to quick release them and it can be a pain in the butt trying to pull all 6 hooks out of a 40"" muskie when its not wanting to be in the boat with you ..  other then that i keep the barbs on ...  maybe im just weird.. but it works for me and havnt had any problems so far"
338132,NBR,2009-05-04 21:17:00,163,I pinch the barbs down almost 100% and have for over 30 years. I never noticed losing more fish.
338137,fishing n autograph,2009-05-04 21:38:00,2540,"I don't usually unless I'm fishing the upper grand....but then again, i don't really catch anything anyway so it makes lures hard to get out of trees!"
338224,Weeds,2009-05-05 01:11:00,782,I pinched the barbs down on my lucky 9 inch Suick last year and figure I might pinch down them on my bucktails this year too. I figure I will probably leave my big musky spinnerbaits alone as the single hook is easier/safer to handle and remove anyway.
338232,muddler,2009-05-05 01:24:00,623,"I debarb everthing that my kids (8 and 10 years old) use. That includes baited hooks and lures. It has saved a lot of problems when we fish. I've removed too many accidental casts from different body parts painlessly. It is also easier for the kids to remove the hook from a fish by themselves.  As for my lures I debarb all lures and flies. The only barb I keep on is the hook for fishing a roe bag or single egg. The bait stay on the hook that way.  I debarb by gently and firmly pressing down the barb with a pair of pliers first, then using a battery operated hook sharpener I smooth down the bump. If I do it a t home a Dremel type tool and a cone shaped stone does the job in a jiffy.  muddler"

338364,dks,2009-05-05 12:36:00,36,"I pinch down my barbs 100% as well. The majority of my fishing is catch and release, so easy hook removal is important for me. When I started fishing years ago I had the misfortune of hooking the back of my head with a fly that was snagged. You know, snagged fly, pull rod, snag frees up, pull back rod to prevent tangle,oops, fly in back of head..... Well, let's say I pinched down barbs ever since.  Last year I embedded a treble in my hand and even though the hooks had their barbs pinched down, it was a challenge to remove it. I would have hated it if it was barbed!"
