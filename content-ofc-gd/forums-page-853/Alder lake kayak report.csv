I managed two smallish carp (14-16"") but they are going into spawning mode and weren't all that interested in a meal. I was fishing shallow and got snagged on stumps and lay downs several times before I snagged on this fellow.  I thought I had hooked another log, until I pulled it to the surface. He was none too happy with me.  I put my paddle next to him to give it some perspective. The blade on that paddle is 18"" long and 6"" wide. I guestimated the shell to be 24"" long and I wasn't getting any closer to measure it. His head was the same size as my fist. I cut the line about 8"" above the jig to save my fingers any damage."

337967,limeyangler,2009-05-04 13:53:00,5204,Great pics Jedi   I have never snagged one of those...i aint complaining though   Did you catch the carp on the yellow twisty tail?
338041,jediangler,2009-05-04 16:14:00,1923,Limeyangler I loaded up the jig & grub with scent and casted it into the shallows and let it sit. I had to re-scent every cast because it washed away so quickly. A couple of guys were getting them on corn where I launched the kayak.
338172,Leecher,2009-05-04 23:11:00,7832,WOW that's a big turtle Wise decision on your part for not even trying to get to your jig  At that size could of taken a few fingers out Thanks for sharing Leechman
