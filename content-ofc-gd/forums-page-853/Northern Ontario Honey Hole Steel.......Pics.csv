338464,TDunn,2009-05-05 17:21:00,680,"This past weekend I packed up and moved back to Sault Ste. Marie from London. I have been waiting to go steelheading for weeks and finally got out yesterday afternoon with my cousin.  We went 5 for 8 with the biggest being 28 inches. The first 4 fish were all females and were definitley all spawned out. The 5th fish was the smallest at 16 inches and was the only male. No pic of that one it was caught in a small river on the way home and the camera was in the car. Still snow patches in the bush and the water level was pretty good. Its feels great to be home......I love the north.....               Hopefully get out again this week....But i have to get some writing done so instead I may hit up some Atlantics in the boat....Its only 10 mins away.....Oh, all fish were released.....   TDunn"
