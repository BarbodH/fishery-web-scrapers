338100,zman,2009-05-04 19:29:00,179,I'm not sure what they are called but I want to get a pair of these and try starting the boat in the driveway before I go away this weekend.  I gues you hook the garden hose to them and were abouts do they go on the motor  I see a few little slits on the shaft is that the spot ?
338101,rbaquial,2009-05-04 19:30:00,968,"LMAO! Wow, I have a dirty mind... I thought you were asking about a DIFFERENT kind of EAR MUFFS!"
338102,edmichit,2009-05-04 19:32:00,145,"what type and size and yr of motor do you own. You will get better direction from the group if you provide that information Most marina's, boat sales and service locations and even CTC sells the muffs."
338104,zman,2009-05-04 19:33:00,179,I have a 1999 90HP Johnson and also a 9.9 four stroke
338105,Terry,2009-05-04 19:35:00,14456,yup the slots are where you put it  just make sure water comes out the water hole when it's running and you are good to go
338109,edmichit,2009-05-04 19:44:00,145,"ya make sure you have water coming out the peep, or it will not be a good opening weekend for ya.  "
338119,zman,2009-05-04 20:02:00,179,If it starts how long to you wait before I should see the water Thanks again guys but I'm kinda new at the boat ownership part
338120,Terry,2009-05-04 20:05:00,14456,"with some with the pressure from the hose , it's right away but with other it's a little longer  if it doesn't start in 10 seconds I would say there is a problem"
338130,NBR,2009-05-04 21:12:00,163,On some motors it doesn't always start right away. If you have a temp gauge watch that and don't let it get more than about 1/2 way.
338131,irishfield,2009-05-04 21:15:00,26272,I prefer the garbage can full of water approach myself.... and generally costs nothing as well... guarantees the intakes are under water. On some engines muffs don't do the job.
338134,tomO,2009-05-04 21:27:00,363,my 25 horse merc has a thermastat so it takes a bit for the water to flow.
338135,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-04 21:34:00,10439,  Works great for smaller motors but not so much with large outboards. I don't even think my lower unit will fit in a garbage can.
338138,irishfield,2009-05-04 21:38:00,26272,My 275 Verado's lower unit fits in a garbage can ..... but yes it's a BIG can.
338143,Terry,2009-05-04 22:07:00,14456,I'd like to see you throttle up  in gear while in a garbage can water wouldn't last long
338145,Dara,2009-05-04 22:09:00,3052,"I prefer the garbage can method myself. Just remember, do not even pull an outboard over without water. The little rubber impeller needs to be wet or it could stick and break and then you have no water pump. It doesn't even need to start, if you're lucky, one pull can do it"
338146,Dara,2009-05-04 22:10:00,3052,  LOL   I think thats why you don't do that
338151,tjsa,2009-05-04 22:33:00,1578," Lemme guess, its big, green, has welded channels down the side, and probably has the letters BFI on the outside.   I'd like to see that also, sounds like a Mythbuster's episode in the making,"
338285,ohhenrygsr,2009-05-05 03:05:00,947,Ok i got my Ear Muffs on Start her up 
338316,SlowPoke,2009-05-05 05:18:00,2984,"   Not even close, It's red.  "
338710,wallyboss,2009-05-06 13:14:00,1095,I use a plastic bin full of water and I cut out a piece of the cover that goes around the lower unit and then I tape plastic around to keep the water in.  I wouldn't leave in gear for 20 minutes though but it works for me.
