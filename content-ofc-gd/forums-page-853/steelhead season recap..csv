336603,silvio,2009-04-30 12:10:00,433,kelfun how was your opener bud?
336615,NAC,2009-04-30 12:51:00,369,"Nice Silvio!  definitely a succesful season. How come you are capping it at that?  Still lots of drop-backs to be had, or are you moving on to another species?"
336622,Steel28,2009-04-30 13:05:00,160,Great results bud.
336630,Victor,2009-04-30 13:14:00,1609,"geez Silvio, stop posting pics you took in 2007 and pretend that you caught all that fish this year  it's too bad i have to work this week, would have loved to join you guys on the overnight trip, my first few encounters with the steelies on the pin was awesome, I must entice a few carp to take my offering on the pin this year.  Great report buddy, and also thank you for helping me get started. Once the trout season slows lets go get some carp."
336672,silvio,2009-04-30 16:06:00,433, Never would I think I would get bored of fishing steelhead but this season I did. I might head out a bit more but I think I am going to work my   off and buy a boat.  Vic well get some carp on the pin when the time comes. Let me know when your free me and mike will guide you to chrome. I enjoyed watching the blank stare on your face when you hooked your first steelhead... made the time mike Berge and I spend re rigging you and helping you worth it. Usually when I rig my dad up he just screws it up somehow was nice for a change to have someone make use of it lol. And for the 07 time stamp on my camâ€¦ I was to busy getting fish to change it

336702,MJL,2009-04-30 17:15:00,2427,"Great orgy of Chrome!  Great fishing with you this season.  With that said, I'm asking for a formal apology for what you did in the car the other day...You know what I'm talking about.  The rainshadow is mine till I get one"
336710,silvio,2009-04-30 17:46:00,433, Lol Bud on the way home I let another one go almost killed myself forgot I locked the windows lol.
336711,KelfuN,2009-04-30 17:53:00,246,i had an exam THAT day...finished at 3pm so i fished the closest trib i could find by myself...went 5/6 until the thunderstorm came in. 
336717,alphaalpha,2009-04-30 18:15:00,475,"Some of those are quite the beasts. Nice work!!!  I think it will be a long time before i get bored of of the steelies.  Definately go for a boat though, its very nice just chilling and reeling in a monster every now and again on a gorgeous summer afternoon."
336726,Victor,2009-04-30 18:46:00,1609,I think i'm going to equip myself with a gas mask if I do ever get in the same car with you lol. Thank you for the heads up Mike.
336863,Joeytier,2009-05-01 01:22:00,3990,"Looks like a great season.  This year was definitely my best steelheading season.  I finally made the switch to the pin in October, and learned far more this season about trout and reading water than any other season thus far.  btw your jigs are deadly."
338301,rbaquial,2009-05-05 03:50:00,968,HOLY SMOKES!!! Nicely done!!
