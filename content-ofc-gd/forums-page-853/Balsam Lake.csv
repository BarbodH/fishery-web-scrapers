335407,Skud,2009-04-27 14:15:00,739,Balsam is pretty crappy early season because the fish are really scattered as they move from their spawning areas to the summer haunts. When the weeds start to thicken you can start getting them on the edges.
335509,fishermccann,2009-04-27 19:16:00,655,Yes I agree the pics. are hard to pinpoint early in the year on Balsam.
335621,Rizzo,2009-04-27 23:33:00,4754,use a sledge in sucker flavor or a  10 inch suick. I catch pesky walleye each time I am there

Says he can find them with his eyes closed.  Just fish really big lures.  No seriously, i heard x-raps and jointed rapalas and white twisters.  Natural colors though.  I think i'll be seeing you up there!!!  Mizzmo"
