Anyways, she asked me to let ya'll know she is holding on to it until someone comes and gets it....nothing has happened to it.  That is all,  Steve"
281098,Spiel,2008-12-18 12:26:00,9065,"...Uh oh, somebody messed up!"
281115,Rizzo,2008-12-18 13:45:00,4754,"might have been me. I travel with all my awards all the time...oh wait a minute, never been to Quinte"
281117,Headhunter,2008-12-18 13:51:00,5703,"The trophy was given to us on Sunday morning, to pass along to Lexington, as his cottage was next door to ours. We put it in his cottage while they were out fishing Sunday morning, assuming they were coming back to the cottage... which they didn't. I beleive that Lexington posted re the trophy and if anyone was going to be near Perfect View, could they bring it back with them. Apparently, Perfect View still has it! HH"
281131,LeXXington,2008-12-18 15:19:00,1928,"Yeap, Joanne told me she was going to hold it unitl I could get it or someone pick it up.  It was going too cost too much too Mail too me  Again if anyone is around the area if you can bring it back into the city I would be most appreaciated.  Thanks  Lexx"
