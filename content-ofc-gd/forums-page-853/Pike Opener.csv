337474,highdrifter,2009-05-03 02:41:00,2534,"G'day folks,  Soo..  In lieu of a postponed tourney for shall we say a more glamorous fish, I decided I'd put some dings on the baitcaster and join the ol boyz for some long awaited piking!!  Lucid and Hillrat are my usual partners in carnage but since saturday had been checked for other things, they had made plans to fish with Gerrid from his boat..  No biggy, it just meant that I could deviously get there earlier and work some virgin water!!  I told them I'd catch up with em later.  Surprised myself..  Got up extra early and had my waders strapped on for 7:30 freaking AM!!  Here's some solo pics, human tripod style.  First feisty lady fish.  On the way to the bay...     Fishing only really starded heating up around noonish, when we had some good cloud cover..  This one hit like a freighter!!     Another..  Nothing huge, but real good to feel those pike takes again.     C'mon darling.. dance for me..  OOOHHHH!     Burd Island..  Alot sparser since the last time I was here.  Stink was still there though!     Gerrid with a noice Toronto gator..  The better fish of the day.     Doug (Lucid)..  We hit a little slicker weather!     Today's choice of crank..  A lucky craft tenesse shad live pointer.   I'm starting to think clown and firetiger is no longer a staple in their diet..  I didn't switch up once!  Big thanks to Gerrid for letting me hop into his boat..  It was certainly welcome after spending 4 hours waist deep in 47degree water!  Hope you enjoyed.  cheers HD  ps:  Mepps wha happen?!"
337480,tinbanger,2009-05-03 02:48:00,1028,great action shot !!!  Thanks for posting .  TB
337482,pigeonfisher,2009-05-03 02:50:00,696,You guys did well.  Nice to see some folks sharing a ride with a wader.  It must have been cold.  Those fish have great colour at this time of year.
337500,Jigger,2009-05-03 04:23:00,1237,"Me fait plaisir Phidal. Anytime man. We had lots of follows and short strikes on board until you brought that first monster in the boat  , too bad we didn't get a pick of that one! If we had made the appropriate changeup earlier, I'm sure we could've converted those fish that were lure-shy. Good to see you guys again, but next time, maybe we can avoid the turbulence at the end of the day. That wasn't any fun. (Jigger)"" Guys, I think maybe we should put the lifejackets on..."", (Lucid) "" I was just thinking the same thing...""  C'est la première fois que je voyais mon nom écrit en ce maniere. Quelle surprise!"
337506,rbaquial,2009-05-03 05:08:00,968,Great Pictures!! Sounds like you boyz had a blast! I'm heading out tomorrow with a old College buddy... hopefully we'll land a few!  Definitely make a post if we get any!  Thanks for sharing!
337527,b2kptbo,2009-05-03 11:17:00,1505,"Some nice Pike, like that jump picture, pays to get out there..."
337535,ccmtcanada,2009-05-03 12:12:00,7971,Beauty pics!  Great shot of that one jumping out of the water!
337536,highdrifter,2009-05-03 12:13:00,2534," 5 more seconds after that 6ft monster hit man ..  I would have screamed and said:  ""There's no freaking way we're gonna make it..  Might as well wait it out and fish!!""  Notice how Lucid kept adjusting his floater strap?!  Pretty hairy stuff!  How should I write your name jiggar?!!"
337540,alphaalpha,2009-05-03 12:42:00,475,"very nice fish and pics, well done!"

337659,ben306,2009-05-03 20:38:00,59,"Nice work.  Love the colours in these Canadian Pike, no where near as 'muddy' coloured or dull as the UK fish  I get there on Wednesday so I might have to bend your ear for some pointers when I get out myself."
337726,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-03 23:29:00,3761,"Great pictures man, glad to see you did very well out there!"

337810,MJL,2009-05-04 01:31:00,2427,Dude!  That's awesome!  Great report and pics.  Those are super fat fish.  That action shot of the pike jumping is worthy of being in a fish-porn calendar of some sort.
337933,ehg,2009-05-04 12:04:00,2666,"Being out there at that spot in a boat, at this time of year, is absolutely the best T.O piking.  Congrats on the success!  Great report, ehg"
