338062,mj2112,2009-05-04 17:24:00,46,"Had a great weekend in Presque Isle Bay Erie, Pa.  Caught 40 bass with the biggest being 22 inches.  Took my girlfriend fishing who never really fished before and she didn't want to stop fishing.  If you have never fished Lake Erie in Pennsylvania, you should definetely consider stopping there for a weekend.  You will not be disappointed.   I am always happy when you take a novice person fishing and put them on fish.  It is so much better to see them catching them and having a blast.    "
338063,Marko,2009-05-04 17:30:00,854,"Oh rub it in why dont you lol. Season does not start here for another month or so... Great fish tho, very nice"
338067,mj2112,2009-05-04 17:45:00,46,"Thank you for the compliment.  I am not rubbing it in though!  I am just proud of the fish she caught.  I am sharing this information with all of you since you all have helped me many times before when I had questions about fishing in Canada.  If anybody wanted to fish this part of Lake Erie let me know and I might be able to give you some information that would be helpful.  It is only 2 hours from Buffalo, NY."

338480,gogu392,2009-05-05 17:57:00,142,"Nice pigs. Erie is faumous for SM. Can you share with us your tehnique? Line, lure type?  Congrats again."
338501,mj2112,2009-05-05 19:03:00,46,"Lake Erie technique is pretty simple.  She was jigging or dragging a 3"" dark green Tube bait with a 1/4 ounce led head inside the tube (we call them Gitzits) on the bottom of the lake.  We were drifting from 22 feet deep up into about 9 feet deep when that big smb hit.  Not sure what tubes are available in Canada but the ones that have the most success in Pennsylvania in my opinion is called an M200.  Hope that answered your question."
338504,gogu392,2009-05-05 19:14:00,142,Thank you for your fast answer. I like the fight with SM. My Regards.
