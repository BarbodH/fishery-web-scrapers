338003,Dara,2009-05-04 15:02:00,3052,"I guess all this talk about the whitefish, I better post some pictures.  We weren't the first boat out there.   Ended up being at least 20 boats out there. Our friendly neighborhood CO showed up and checked every license where was.    we ended up with about 20 fish lost a couple of dandys hot lure for the day was a 3"" long Sweedish pimple in gold with the bumps on it. When I cut my fish open they were eating 3"" long smelts. Fun cranking these guys out of 85' of water. I'll be there for the next few weekends, then on to the walleyes  "
338004,Dara,2009-05-04 15:05:00,3052,for some reason they won't post like they usually do 
338013,troutologist,2009-05-04 15:22:00,951,Looks like a good one for sure. That same lure has been real good for our group for lakers as well the last couple of years.  Was there still icechunks floating around or were they done this weekend?
338024,Dara,2009-05-04 15:40:00,3052,  Where can you buy that Lure?  Ice chunks were gone as far as I could see. Water was 1.2 degrees Watch for logs floating around
338166,Leecher,2009-05-04 23:03:00,7832,Great looking whities Dara  Great job       Congratulations Those will surely taste good in the frying pan!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
338187,xeon,2009-05-04 23:44:00,350," Of all the places to buy lures, last year the Zellers on Great Northern Ave. had them in their ""fishing"" section. Just happened to stumble across them when picking up a package from the Canada Post. If not, try Canadian Tire, but usually the pimples are sold as ice fishing gear. And if not there, try the trading post, then if all else fails, western auto. They are a pretty popular bait though, but that colour may not be the easiest to find."
338201,Fudd,2009-05-05 00:16:00,94,Nice mess of whities there mate... you can get the jigs here right from the source http://www.swedishpimple.com they are my favourite jig... infact i am hard pressed to use anything else.
338207,troutologist,2009-05-05 00:40:00,951,  I found them at western this winter. If they don't have them in Orest can get them for you.

338375,doack,2009-05-05 13:23:00,46,"Do you use these swedish pimples in summer time for whitefish?  How do you fish them?  Any help would be appreciated.  Depths, techniques, we will be up in Chapleau area in August, and one of the lakes has whitefish, and it would be fun to give it a try.  Any help would be appreciated."
338384,Zubris21,2009-05-05 14:16:00,563,Great Whities!  I've only caught little dinks in the lakes up here!  getting one of those big ones is on my want to do list!  Thanks for the report!
338404,Dara,2009-05-05 14:58:00,3052,  All summer long. You gotta drive right by this lake to get to Chapleau. Lay in on the bottom and jig it off.
338428,tjsa,2009-05-05 16:07:00,1578,"Dara!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A fishing report??????????  WOW, heh, heh, heh, hows it going guy?  Any more wood creations you want to share with us??  And, congrats on the new boat, and the whitefish."
338429,doack,2009-05-05 16:08:00,46,"Thanks Dara, we will have to give it a shot.  Does time of day matter much for them?  You have quite a variety of lakes to fish up there, you are a very lucky man!"
338514,Dara,2009-05-05 20:07:00,3052," Start at daybreak and they shut down by 10 am, in this lake anyway. They are in 85 fow"
338515,Dara,2009-05-05 20:11:00,3052,"  well, I did this clock this winter.    and a few other things "
338516,Dara,2009-05-05 20:14:00,3052,maybe now 
338667,xeon,2009-05-06 05:44:00,350," Thats pretty strange, allot of the whitefish in the bays around the Soo also stop biting at around 10-11am."
