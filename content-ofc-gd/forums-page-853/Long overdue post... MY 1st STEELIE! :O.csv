338282,rbaquial,2009-05-05 03:01:00,968,"Well, a couple weeks ago now... I went to hit the local Tribs with 2 buddies off the board; L2P and FLOATMAN MIKE. I was excited.... it was a couple days after opener....So, my blood was pumping! ""Maybe this is it! Maybe I'll actually catch/land one!""...... We hit a couple pools... nothing! I was quickly getting discouraged and thinking... ""This isn't for me!""... LOL.... anyway, about two hours later... we meetup with FLOATMAN MIKE up stream..... it was the ""Magic"" pool.... hahaha.... I hook into one... fought it for probably a good 30sec before my knot @ the hook failed! Grrrrrrrrrr!!! SO UPSETTING!! Then I finally hook and land into one....Wow, the fight on these Float Rods are FUN! You can feel EVERY LITTLE THING they do! Even if the fish farted in the river... my rod twitched!  anyway, I'll stop rambling... here are the pics!  Enjoy.... I sure did! *Can't wait till my waders come in! I'm becoming more and more addicted to this style of fishing!*        Also forgot to mention - caught on my new setup!  "
338289,MJL,2009-05-05 03:09:00,2427,Big Congrats  Beauty piece of steel...You never forget your first one.
338293,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-05 03:18:00,270,when you guys going to hook up and let me experience my first steel?
338295,Fudd,2009-05-05 03:21:00,94,Nice job mate.. they will get easier from now on in.... i am sure that setup will catch you many many more. Best of luck.
338334,b2kptbo,2009-05-05 11:27:00,1505,"Congrats on your first, sounds like the fish isn't the only one hooked, WTG..."
338347,ccmtcanada,2009-05-05 11:49:00,7971,"Now that the first is out of the way, it'll be much easier for you!  Congrats on your first...it's a beauty for sure!"
338360,kickingfrog,2009-05-05 12:25:00,8333,"Oh Oh. You are going to become one of ""them""... or ""us""? I don't consider myself one of them, even though I am one of them.  Nice fish! I'm sure it will be the first of many."
338371,GBW,2009-05-05 13:03:00,8460,Congrats man!  nice fish for sure!!
338389,Zubris21,2009-05-05 14:22:00,563,Congrats on your first!  Beautiful fish!
338401,Twocoda,2009-05-05 14:54:00,4130,Almost EVERY floater loses his first ...which in-turn makes you aprreciate the landings that much more....it becomes a personal statistic to regulate your progress as a fisherman.....the key to success is always be consious of your presentation ....  Congrates on the first landing ...   even if my spelling doesnt present itself quite well
338412,alphaalpha,2009-05-05 15:17:00,475,"congrats man!  i also landed my first one earlier this spring, after about a dozen outings in the fall with only one on which broke my line as well  unfortunately i was solo and couldn't get any good pics (not that i will be forgetting it anytime soon). i did however get a couple more my second time out and got some pics  yours are awesome, keep up the good work!"
338420,TJQ,2009-05-05 15:39:00,7806,Congrats!!
338439,lucabrasi,2009-05-05 16:29:00,114,"Congrats! After you experience the head shakes and runs for the first time, you'll keep going back again and again."
338447,Bly,2009-05-05 16:38:00,1556,Congrats!
338466,l2p,2009-05-05 17:22:00,346,"hahah i remember this day vividly, i dont think he uttered a single word while fighting the fish. just a big ol grin on his face   hahaha"
338469,rbaquial,2009-05-05 17:25:00,968,  LMAO!!! That's true! Hahahaha....
338470,BillM,2009-05-05 17:27:00,17367,"Nice job man!!!  I guess I got lucky and landed my first on a pin in the mighty Geen.  I have however lost lots of fish since then, lol  Better start saving your $$$ now, this gets very addicting."
338477,l2p,2009-05-05 17:40:00,346,"haha that definatly an odd day to be out, we all hooked into fish but only landed 1 each... after you left me and mike checked another river out and hooked into couple more fish each but i couldnt land any and mike beaches a huge unspawned female. heres a couple more pics from that day ahah  my 1 fish lol   mikes huge unspawned female(anyone know why this one has reddish fins? you cant tell from the pic but the color of this fish was certainly different also) "
338478,rbaquial,2009-05-05 17:42:00,968,"  Never heard anything more true than that... I've already spent $550... and that's just on the REEL, ROD & VEST"
338481,BillM,2009-05-05 17:58:00,17367,"Buy used man, I got some crazy deals on my stuff."
338692,Garnet,2009-05-06 11:39:00,2056,"Great fish. I remember my first 33 years ago Goodyear Dam.  Looking at your buddy in the background and that gin clear water, If you stand back about 10ft further you catch a ton more just like that.  Garnet"
338737,KelfuN,2009-05-06 15:16:00,246," if your looking for a kingpin, let me know"
