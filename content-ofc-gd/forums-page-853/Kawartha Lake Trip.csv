Lots of weeds, shallow lake, would my best bet be to fish a drop shot type rig with maybe gulp leeches on that lakes weedlines etc?  any advice/tips appreciated"

338519,Terry,2009-05-05 20:27:00,14456,"if there are good weeds fish them if it's windy, fish the blown side of the lake they can be shallow, real shallow"
