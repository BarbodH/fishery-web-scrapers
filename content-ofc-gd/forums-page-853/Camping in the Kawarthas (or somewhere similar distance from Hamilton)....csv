338255,Rizzo,2009-05-05 02:05:00,4754," its been a few years since I've booked at a provincial park, but the last couple of years I did go it was hard enough getting one site! Then again, I was always looking to go long week-ends with the rest of the huddled masses. Although I've never been there, I drive past Oastler Lake Pr. Park occasionally and it appears as if they have a sand beach. This park is about 10 minutes south of Parry Sound on the old 69."

Presquile has a nice large sandy beach on lake ontario, and just out side the main enterance is a public boat launch into Brighton Bay if you wanna do some fishing. And if your not going to have the boat, there is Murray Canal which is about a 10 min drive, and you can catch Pike/Walleye/Drum/Perch/Crappie/Bass.  If your looking to be a little more north. friend of mine recently purchased and runs Cordova Lake Campground and have Hydro and Water Hookups. Small sandy beach, a dock and boat launch. And if your lookin for info on the fishing, there is probly lots of people on here that fish Cordova."

I would go to Long Point PP or Turkey Point PP over the Kawarthas any day for a family vacation. Amazing beaches and clean water. Great fishing. Three sites together might be tough without reservations though so book early.
