Even had a double header going at one point, but only one landed from it.  See if my fishing buddy who stole the show will post his pics as well, Lol.      "

338642,alphaalpha,2009-05-06 02:17:00,475,very nice fish!  my soon to be father-in-law wanted to learn how to fly fish so we have been out a couple times this spring experimenting. it's so hard not to just grab my float rod though.  if you are ever fishing in the east end tribs i would love to come out and meet up with you to pick up a few pointers
