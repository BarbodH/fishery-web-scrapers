I thought I had some pics from then uploaded somewhere, but I guess I don't. Hopefully I'll get some of the babies when the time comes. It does explain why I'm constantly hearing cardinals though."
338492,shane,2009-05-05 18:39:00,652,That's pretty cool.  But I hope you're an early riser.  We have cardinals in a tree outside our bedroom window every morning at the crack of dawn and they are pretty loud.
338548,Gerritt,2009-05-05 21:42:00,6129,"What do you mean ""you will get some of the babies"" ???"
338551,Beats,2009-05-05 21:46:00,543,I think he means he'll get some pics of the babies.
338558,danbouck,2009-05-05 22:00:00,4380, mmm... JK  I know what ya meant!
338561,Cudz,2009-05-05 22:03:00,2652,"Pretty sure he means he will wat some baby cardinals, maybe"
338568,Joey,2009-05-05 22:24:00,9122,"Sorry to see that.   As cool as it seems at first, the noise can be unbelievable at times and the birdcrap that will stream down the wall and cover the ground or anything near the nest is really a pain to clean off.  Went through that 2 years ago and the next spring I stuffed the hole in my porch where they built the nest with steel wool.  Pics of the babies will be cool tho, since they're already there.  Not much you can do about it now.  Joey"
338570,Gerritt,2009-05-05 22:32:00,6129,pictures! Whew!... I just pictures cardinals stuck in a cage like a budgie!  G
