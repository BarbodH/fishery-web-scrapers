Anyway, I also was able to meet two Hall of Fame Pitchers while I was down there - Juan Marichal and Bob Feller....  Here are some pics  Juan Marichal    Bob Feller    Now to the game!  Home run swing - this guy hit a mammoth shot for a grand slam...    Former Blue Jay Paul Spoljaric    Double Play Ball    It was a great day for baseball...forget hockey! Play Ball!"

Liked watching a pro game while sitting in the grass, my 6 yr old daughter loved it.  Didn't know Bob Feller and Juan Marichal were there.  The daughter wants to go next Sunday at 2pm she enjoyed the experience so much!  Strange that you posted this after my first time watching there. Cool pics  The Juan Marichal pic is awesome."

338075,acmarou,2009-05-04 18:20:00,63,"I get to the pit as often as I can to support the boys. After the May 2 4 weekend I'm usually fishing up north on Sundays, but weekday evening games I'm there. I buy a dog and a pop, tickets for the draw and get some great baseball. I don't have kids, but if I did, I know where I'd be taking them to check out a ball game. IT'S FREE!!!  I must sound like a IBL commercial but I gotta tell ya, if you have little people, bring em down there. The boys don't mind talking to you and your kids. It's a family friendly league.  GO LEAFS GO!!!"
