337485,Garry2Rs,2009-05-03 03:00:00,1425,I got out several times this past week and found a few more Crappie each trip Today was sort of a break-through day! The average size increased and some favourite spots that had been barren suddenly have fish. If you have been holding back waiting for the fish to really start biting...wait no more...grin.
337490,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-03 03:07:00,270,a gentleman in Bewdley said the crappie really congregate towards the docks in the warmer weather.  We struck out last Saturday but might head up there again! Also what is up with the cheaper gas prices....us hamiltonians and Torontonians are getting slaughtered!@
337545,Garry2Rs,2009-05-03 13:21:00,1425,"A lot of people struck-out opening weekend. I think that the high water was holding back the weed growth. My hot-spots were all empty too. It got better everyday last week and Saturday we got 40, by casting to any old cabbage or other tall weeds we could see. Most of them were good size fish, not the Dinks that were biting at the beginning of the week. My nieghbour also found a good spot and boated forty, but lost one when a 40inch Musky took his bait and the Crappie that had eaten it...HAHAHA.  I am headed to the Hammer mid-week, what are you paying for gas?"
337547,ccmtcanada,2009-05-03 13:24:00,7971,We are headed out to the Kawartha in about a half hour looking for them!   We did ok opening weekend...fished deeper than we thought we should...around any weeds/structure we could find.
337676,Beans,2009-05-03 21:23:00,3339,The last two nights of zero celcius sure shut the crappie down in our area...one of the boats found some a little further out in the lake from our shore spots along with a bunch of bluegills...I told my bro-in-law that it was bad luck to bring a banana in his snack pak but did he listen...oh no...what does that crazy old beans know...
337714,ccmtcanada,2009-05-03 23:15:00,7971,"Ended finding half decent numbers,  but only a few 'keeper' sized crappie today...not enough to really take home.  The winds out there were brutal...even with the anchor dragging along AND the wind sock.  Every time we'd find a spot with them, it would take 30 seconds to drift the area.  Winds died down around 5pm and we caught a few more, but it was time to leave.....figures...LOL"
337780,Garry2Rs,2009-05-04 00:47:00,1425,I also had a tougher time today.  The morning was brutal! After it warmed up we got two dozen by fishing sheltered areas where we could see tall weeds in shallow water.
337952,bbog,2009-05-04 13:12:00,665,Like ccmt said it was a challenge holding to a spot with the high winds. Didn't find any crappie but lots of bluegills. Will try again of course.
338111,ecmilley,2009-05-04 19:45:00,2163,"I was out Sunday and as stated it was brutal winds, managed around 50 fish with 10 keepers all caught in sheltered area's and canals, water temps were 55-60 in the canals and 49-52 in the main lake"
338114,fish-miester,2009-05-04 19:47:00,864,"I have only caught a handful of crappie and perch , though I have been catching TONES of rock bass :|"
338154,River Rat,2009-05-04 22:43:00,161,I got into the crappie real good last Monday afternoon...took day of for steelhading and went out and pounded crappie in the afternoon...back out this sunday and fished all day for 4 crappies.....at least I have some in the freezer!  RR
