338127,Rich Clemens,2009-05-04 20:49:00,3131,I've seen a couple articles recently about using creepers for some musky action ?  I've been using Top Raiders and was looking for something a bit different for a little top water action this year.  Checked out Rollie & Helen's site and they have a variety.   Just wondering if anyone has used these kind of baits and if it may be worth my while to pick up a couple for this year.  My musky fishing is on the French River and the West Bay of Nipissing.  Gotta do something a bit different to change my luck around.  Thanks in advance.

They are probably one of the slowest working topwaters, which I have a feeling will lead me to throw my Pacemaker more often. Not so sure I have the patience to throw something so slow.  I grabbed this one on eBay for about $15 US."
