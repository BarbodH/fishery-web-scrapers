336004,ch312,2009-04-28 19:22:00,1590,  i support you 100% but you shouldnt use this in your argument as it may cause problems for the fry stand owner. maybe they just havent had any complaints about the fry stand so they havent looked into how far it is away from the restaurant. you bringing this up will make them look into it and the fry stand guy would likely have to relocate.
336005,nautifish,2009-04-28 19:24:00,1416,  Actually from what i was told from the locals.. he did have to fight for the spot and he actually took it too council......& thankyou for the support.  Nauti.  SJ....Thankyou....

336249,bigfish1965,2009-04-29 06:37:00,3382,I think a tact to take is that you do not sell the same product. Yours are sausages or all beef foot longs...theirs are 'by product meal' poop on a bun.
336416,nautifish,2009-04-29 20:24:00,1416,Well i just had a phone call from Norfolk Council....They are sending out the letter today to my adress to revoke my Licence....I guess from what i have been told it is the guy that owns the Arcade that has been putting in complaints to Council here in Norfolk county.....  They are saying i do not have a right too apeal because i am not a permanant location....Make sence of that then.....When i applied for my licenece they told me i had to have a permanant location as in Adress where my Hotdog cart would be situated. Otherwise they would not issue my licence....Now they are telling me that i am not a permanant location because i am not allowed to be there.  I am furious right now.....  Nauti.
336423,JohnF,2009-04-29 20:35:00,3494," Ask your lawyer if this is a planning issue and if so, why can't it be appealed to the OMB. I'm not suggesting that's a practical solution but it may raise some eyebrows as a credible threat.  JF"
336444,Radnine,2009-04-29 21:43:00,1538,"Could you put your cart on a barge or something and get off the land completely? Sell your doggies on the water side of the Rotten Ronny's. In other words think outside of the box a bit for your solution. Also try to keep in mind that there is someone that has invested in bricks and mortar and sees you as a threat. Council is supporting them for a reason (like they employ people to work on the building, fix the pinball machines, local plumbers, what ever). Somewhere in a parallel universe there is a forum where everyone is supporting the arcade owner from the invasion of the transient cart people!! I think that there has to be a solution here once issues aren't clouded with partisanship. Good luck. Jim"

336618,JohnF,2009-04-30 12:59:00,3494," I may be stretching the role of municipal planning &  the OMB too much here, but it seems to me that your licence was granted under the local zoning bylaw, which is an extension of the Official Plan and the Planning Act, and if they're now pulling it under the same bylaw everyone has a right of appeal to the OMB for any planning issues.  On the other hand your lawyer may tell you this licence is granted under some other municipal ordinance and therefore the OMB has no involvement. Presumably the letter will identify the applicable ordinance and the justification for the reversal under that ordinance. Unless you misrepresented the facts on your application, or your business activities are causing a disturbance, I doubt there's any provision in the ordinance for after the fact changes due to discomfited local merchants, and if the municipality has made a mistake under the zoning bylaw then you should have a right of appeal to the OMB (if you want to pay the costs of it).  Good luck JF"
336963,nautifish,2009-05-01 12:26:00,1416,"John i have yet to get the letter...I'm just waiting now to see what it has to say.......I will be at rotton ronnies in the morning and set up as usual.....Now i am just waiting to see if someone shows up to shut me down.....  CD98.9  Also added another story this morning...  Norfolk County : Petitioners Vying To Keep Hot Dog Cart Posted by Adam Liefl     A petition has been started in hopes of keeping the ""Nautidog"" in Long Point. CD 98.9 first brought you the story yesterday of the woman who is in jeopardy of losing the vendor permit for her hot dog cart due to, what she's calling, an unfair bylaw that allowed her to operate with no problems for the past five weeks. Owner Tracy Bennett is saying she just found out her licence would be revoked due to a complaint from a competing business. She also says since she's not a permanent location, she has been denied a right to appeal. A paper petition is available at Rotton Ronnies in Long Point, as well, an online petition has been started on Facebook.  http://cd989.com/modules/news/index.php?st...c=0&start=0"

335515,nautifish,2009-04-27 19:31:00,1416,Thankyou so much for posting this TJ.  It is very much appreciated.  I am fighting with Norfolk bylaw as they now want to revoke my licence they issued to me end of March to set up my Hotdog cart outside of rotton ronnies bait & tackle store in Long point....Business has been good and the Locals have been fabulous in welcoming me too long point.....Now they have said there is an issue about Distance between me and an Arcade that also sells hotdogs.....I guess they do not want the competition.  I am fighting Norfolk Bylaw because if there had been an issue about the distance between myself with the cart and the other location they should have done the measurements before Issueing me my licence.   Apparently Bylaw states that any mobile refreshment Vehicle cannot set up with in 250ft of another location that sells the same product....Yet in Port rowan which is also part of long point there is a fry wagon situated not even 75ft from a restaurant.  I have started an online petition and i also have a petition going at rotton ronnies bait & tackle where i got another 100 signatures over saterday & sunday.  I would really appreciate the support.....The local fisherman & hunting guys love the fact i am there & they can get a quick bite to eat .  Thankyou so much again TJ.....  Nauti.
335519,JohnF,2009-04-27 19:41:00,3494," I would think a business called Rotten Ronnie's Bait & Tackle would have bigger customer relations issues than a bit of competition in the neighbourhood.  ""Didja wanna little worm slime on that weeny, ma'am, or some boraxed salmon roe spread?""  I for one am always tempted to buy my food at places that also sell live bait. It's all about the freshness I guess.  JF"
335520,xeon,2009-04-27 19:44:00,350,"How far away are you from the arcade? I could see if your 40-50m or more away than whatever, but under that you should respect the other business. Also, have you tried talking to the people at the arcade? Im pretty sure most nerds dont get along too well with the outdoors so go in there with a cool head and talk to the manager and work something out. You do really have to put this all into perspective though, if you owned a resturaunt and someone set up a hotdog stand infront of your business, you too would be a bit irretated. And if they change the rules for you, they have to change the rules for everyone, which will cause more problems for everyone.  Wish you the best with your petition though, the city should realize that the markets you and the arcade are selling too are completly different.  Also, what are the rules on the bait place getting the vendors permit instead of you?"
335578,TJQ,2009-04-27 21:45:00,7806," No Problem... it irks me when someones trying to make a living and stupid govt red tape threatens to mess it up.  Good luck.  Also, im sure people could pm m you some support if they are not on facebook!"

335667,nautifish,2009-04-28 01:34:00,1416,  Xeon from what i have been told i am about 240 or maybe 245 ft away from the Arcade...I am not out front of there business.....Bylaw apparently says i have to be 250ft..BUT!! If that is the case as i said they should have done the measurements before issueing my licence ...I have a steady clientel and i have had many people return to enjoy a Nautidog. I don't want to get into it here....More is explained over on facebook.....  JF Rotton ronnies has been in long point for many many years and is well known in long point and does alot of business...   Misfish The only other place online is my own fishing site & as i said rotton ronnie has the petition book at his store....
335669,irishfield,2009-04-28 01:37:00,26272,Buy a tape measure and measure it. It's your lively hood after all. If you're 245 feet.. move over 6 feet left or right and it's a non-issue.
335672,nautifish,2009-04-28 01:43:00,1416,Thats kind of hard to do Irishfeild because i am then on someone elses property....
335676,irishfield,2009-04-28 01:49:00,26272,"I'd imagine the bylaw is FROM their property line... I'd be finding the bylaw.. it's wording etc and using it to YOUR advantage. Your online petition will have absolutely no merit.. especially if the arcade complaint'ent is ""connected"".  When you applied for the licence... is it listed right on the application where you were setting up shop? If so.. they approved it !"
335685,danbouck,2009-04-28 01:57:00,4380,No one even buys hot dogs from the arcade! Signing now
335686,nautifish,2009-04-28 01:58:00,1416,Yup the adress of my Location where my hotdog cart is set up is on my licenece irishfeild.  I am still waiting to get this in writeing..All i have been told is they are going to revoke my licence...Apparently it is not an issue right now because she is not open.....But once she opens if i am there and selling hotdogs they can charge me.... ..AS for the petition.....I think it will have merrit......Most of the 100 people who signed my petition over the weekend are from long point...  I had people take a drive down to the cart specifically to sign my petition as they had heard that Norfolk bylaw want to revoke my licence.  We did do our own measurement a few weeks back but its hard to know where to measure too when we are not sure where there property line starts at the Arcade.  But that all aside.....  Port rowan has a fry wagon set up not even 75ft from another restaurant........Port rowan is part of long point......  This is also my Argument.  Nauti.

335978,tinbanger,2009-04-28 18:49:00,1028,"as per Waynes post .get your hands on the bylaw , compare it with your application and go from there. As far as the chip truck , may not help you with your case . rules can differ from block to block.They may have a variance. The city can still flex thier muscle even if they 'approved' you application.   You may have to go in for a variance .That may include a 'neighbourhood poll' .Basicly asking property owners with a set radius if they have any issues with your application . Make sure you know who gets these letters and that as many as possible are on your side and send back postive comments .Otherwise only the naysayers will be heard.  good luck. TB"
