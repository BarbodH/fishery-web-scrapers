337859,Mattones,2009-05-04 02:36:00,587,"Almost all winter I have been at the girlfriends land following the crazy amount of tracks finding where they bed, where they eat and just pretty much gather as much information as I can about deer and how they live. I have learned alot by just going out and following their tracks and watching them.  Now that summer is upon us and the crazy amount of rain we have gotten i figure i would take a walk out back and look for some sheds and follow some deer tracks to see where they have been. Lets just say i spent almost an entire afternoon out in the yard walking around looking for sheds but mostly just following tracks and just enjoying the nice day!  Some picturesof parts of the land where deer travel often.      Now this picture here had atleast 8 deer different tracks. Must be a nice group! I want to set my camera up in this area but the farm workers may think its a free gift to take home.    The girls Maggie and Sasha following the tracks   Old railway post    Far back along the tracks i came across these tracks. they where deep and HUGE. Must be a big buck Pictures don't do any justice.   Across the railway tracks where i have spotted atleast 20 year grazing last summer.   And this is coming back across the tracks into another open feild.  This is up the hill facing to the railroad tracks   newborn?   Into the near bedding areas its deer heaven! GREAT to set up a ground blind for the coming season ;D(To the left, the right is all swamp)   I came across part of a spine last weekend. Didnt have my camera. It wasent there the week before..   I put my trail camera in a high traffic area this time as the deer seem to avoid the camera everytime. Must be camera shy. Its to the right on a tree its black you can just make it out.   The girls heard a noise and has to check it out  Wanting to chase the fox we spotted   Walking home"

I was also scouting a new hunting area this weekend and for me and my brother, looks real promissing.  I'll try and get some pics next time we go to drop apples and salt to feed them.  Now I have to build a new portable camp for the two of us Jacques"
338182,Sinker,2009-05-04 23:30:00,8692,You should be looking for turkeys!! Its open season!!  Sinker
338198,Mattones,2009-05-05 00:12:00,587, I'm told they are there but i have yet to see them or hear them
338340,Sinker,2009-05-05 11:38:00,8692,You gotta be there at first light or last light. have you tried calling them? They're sneaky buggers them turkeys.......  Sinker
338427,bushart,2009-05-05 16:03:00,2628,Being this is only the first part of May---You might drive yourself crazy by November.  Take this advice if you wish (or not) --old deer guide here...  In the next little while find a good place to put your stand and keep those visits few and far between--maybe leave those dogs at home.  When picking out your stand area---try to invision where they may come from--sit in that stand make sure you can shoot comfortably from most angles---hangin out to one side may cause racket.  If all you want is to see deer ---there's always going to be some out in those fields-mostly does probably-----but if your hunting bucks---you have to stealth her down.  Your time may be best served now looking for old scrapes and rubs-----they will be back and it will give you a starting point for stand locale.---remember the wind---and remember if your stand is on the downside of a hill--he'll be looking at you at eye level if he's on the hilltop.  That buck your after is in his living room and not yours---he'll be away from commotion and always leary--put as many odds in your favour as you can---scent/calls/wind so on and so on.  One more thing---if your bow hunting---take a few practice rounds outta your treestand----shooting down at a target is different than at a rest in the yard or range.  Bushart

338556,Mattones,2009-05-05 21:59:00,587,only if we had Moose up here    hehe  And bushart thanks for your reply. I have spotted a few area's for a tree stand as many are too thin or dead. But Lots of good ground blind area's.
338572,bushart,2009-05-05 22:37:00,2628,ground blinds may be harder to work that compound your running.  Trees are better if you can swing it---remember that buck will want that cover.  Bushart
338660,MillerPhoto,2009-05-06 04:19:00,147,This pic should really get your blood flowin! lol  Shot this pic Nov 25 2005.. Was only about 40 feet away from him.  so would you still classify him as a 8 Point Buck even thou hes missing a antler? lol
