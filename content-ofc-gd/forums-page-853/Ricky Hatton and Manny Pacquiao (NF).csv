337347,Cudz,2009-05-02 21:48:00,2652,pacman decision.
337409,rbaquial,2009-05-03 00:33:00,968,Pacman 5th Rd. Knockdown!  Hahaha...  FLIP PRIDE!!!
337577,bucktail,2009-05-03 14:49:00,1857,Dominant performance from the Pacman! 2nd knock out.....and I mean KNOCKOUT!!!!!!
337586,Hellfish,2009-05-03 15:10:00,308,"was certainly a great fight, now the real fight is going to be mayweather and pacman at the end of the year or beginning of 2010, now that should be balls out for sure."
337635,l2p,2009-05-03 19:08:00,346,id say he won it just in the first.. dropped him twice before the bell rang
337694,rbaquial,2009-05-03 22:27:00,968,Has anyone been able to find HIGHLIGHTS off the internet from the fight? I've tried searching online - and nothing!
337767,Mike Pike,2009-05-04 00:31:00,1332,"Wow!  I didn't expect Hatten to win but I didn't expect THAT kind of knock out so early in the fight.  Pacman is amazing.  I haven't seen a fighter like that in decades!  Now that everyone is calling Manny the best pound for pound fighter on the globe, perhaps Mayweather, now that he's un-retired, will want to sign a fight him.  But Mayweather has skillfully avoided fighting the #1 challenger his whole career so I would be surprised if we ever see Mayweather/Pacquiao."
337915,ricoboxing,2009-05-04 11:21:00,398,pretty boy has to get past juan manuel marquez first (which won't be easy)
337989,Hellfish,2009-05-04 14:38:00,308,"  Certainly agree with that, mayweather is a excellent fighter though with a excellent coaching staff as well. Floyd being undefeated and if he gets past marquez I would LOVE to see the the old pound for pound best boxer vs the new pound for pound it would be intense. ill call it now that floyd will beat marquez then be extra cocky against manny, again manny will surprise the world of boxing."
