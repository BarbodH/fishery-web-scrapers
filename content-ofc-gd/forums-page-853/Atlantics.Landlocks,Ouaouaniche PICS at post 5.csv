337962,darsky,2009-05-04 13:40:00,586,I hit a lake near Montreal on Sunday hoping for my first ever landlocked salmon. We trolled flyrods with sinking ends and hit water in the 10-25 ft range. Baits were small minnow crankbaits and smelt imitating streamers. With lines in the water for only one minute the reel with the small crank screamed. After a great battle a spunky 15 incher was in the boat. These fish are like small steelies on steroids. They can strip line off a reel in seconds. In the next 30 minutes 3 more were boated. Streamers and cranks were both equally effective during the day. There was a period of downtime (45 min) and I was in deep thought when a larger one hit the fly-ZZZZZZZZZTTT  ZZZZTT ZZZZZZTTTTTTT  nearly gave me a heart attack. This fish took the bait and stripped at least 50 ft of backing off the fly reel-in micro seconds. They fly out of the water too. Just awesome. To make this longer story a bit shorter we had at least 27 salmon hit the baits with 18 in the boat. These fish taste great so we brought home our limit of 2 per person. What an amazing way to get into a type of fish that I never caught before. As usual pics should follow
