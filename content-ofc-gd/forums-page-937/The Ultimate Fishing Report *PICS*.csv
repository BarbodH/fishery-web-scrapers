271041,Mike the Pike,2008-11-23 17:21:00,3421,Wow Steve thanks for posting that excellent report.  Do you ever catch anything small.  I only dream of catching fish like that.  Need more time  Excellent Good luck to you out west
271095,steverowbotham,2008-11-23 20:02:00,1800," LOL. Of course I do, I just dont take pictures of them anymore."
271289,tibbs,2008-11-24 04:23:00,650,Great End of the Year Report Steve!
271323,Evan Gallimore,2008-11-24 13:33:00,37,"Your my favorite fisherman ever steve,,,One day i'll be as good as you   lol Hard water crappies  soon buddy very soon..."
271349,steverowbotham,2008-11-24 15:58:00,1800, Call me soon dude. We need to do some steel too!  I finally got my float reel
271364,bigugli,2008-11-24 16:33:00,6138,For only having 66 days on the water you have had an exceptional year.   I've seen you out on Dalrymple once or twice. You have that lake dialed in pretty good.
271377,steverowbotham,2008-11-24 17:04:00,1800," The day I won that tourney was the only good day I had there, but I havent been there since.  I did something completely different than I usually do to catch those fish, I think it would work again."
271385,bigugli,2008-11-24 17:23:00,6138,You didn't hit Dal for bass season? you missed a great season then.
270237,snag,2008-11-21 19:41:00,1932,Amazing  I was thinking about how much fish you'd have in the freezer if you kept them.  You'd need a walk-in freezer the size of a house!  Impressive.  
270241,tinbanger,2008-11-21 19:51:00,1028,"you fish for more than smallies !!  Seriously , an excellent report.  TB"
270246,trapshooter,2008-11-21 20:08:00,1234,Thanks for the shout out Steve. lol  That is great report there yourself.  You had some excellent multi-species fishing this year with loads of big fish.  Congratulations on the tourney success as well.  Good luck in BC.
270249,tbayboy,2008-11-21 20:12:00,1497,Great recap Steve even if it's only November - funny how snow makes you want to look over the years pics .  You had another great year - can't wait to see what's up your sleeve next year.
270250,lew,2008-11-21 20:17:00,12767,"You boated alot of nice fish this year Steve, specially some of those hog bass"

270283,steverowbotham,2008-11-21 21:13:00,1800,"Thanks guys, it was a great year.  Next year will bring much different reports as I am planning a move to BC.  I wonder if there's a BCFNcommunity ??"
270292,misfish,2008-11-21 21:39:00,29133, Maybe you could start one Steve????????????  Great report and you did real well this year. Oh to be young and have the time.LOL  Thanks for taking the time and best of luck to you out west.
270296,Moosebunk,2008-11-21 21:47:00,3970,  Very nice Steve.  Good hodge podge of species and some bigguns too.  Like the bows very much and those lengthy pike are some good fish as well.  Good luck in the 09 dood.
270326,sharper,2008-11-21 22:45:00,279,Nice recap of your year.

270397,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-22 01:15:00,2038,"Very, Very impressive report......Man, those smallies are something else  Congrats Dude"
270423,steverowbotham,2008-11-22 01:59:00,1800,"thanks everyone, it certainly was a fun season"
270507,Stern Rules,2008-11-22 06:47:00,342,I wish I had half the year you did. Good job.
270511,Roy,2008-11-22 10:48:00,13728,"Steve, you've had a stellar year and I thank you for taking the time to put it all together for us to enjoy. There's not a heck of a lot I can add to what's already been posted but, if I may, there's one thing that caught my eye and I'm sure that most others noticed as well. Ben posted his year end recap not long before you did (His is a super report also). You read his report and appreciated it as much as the next guy BUT, you also took the time to mention Ben's report in your opening comments. That speaks volumes for your character Bud.  Thank you again Steve. Your Dad has one more thing to be proud of and we're glad, as a community to have you with us.  Good luck out West. I just hope you keep posting."
270525,Radnine,2008-11-22 12:30:00,1538,"Hey Steve, What a great report. Thanks for it. Just how much time do you spend on the water (sorry if you mentioned it in the text of your report, I only buy this magazine for the photos!)? Ontario's loss is BC's gain. In Ontario there are about 1000 bass smiling to themselves. Safe travels. Jim"
270527,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-22 12:36:00,1362,What a great year you had   ...congrats and thanks for posting all those pics!...really enjoyed them
270555,Fishmaster,2008-11-22 14:24:00,920,Looks like you had a awesome 2008 fishing still got a month or so to add some more ...
270575,steverowbotham,2008-11-22 15:27:00,1800," I keep a very detailed log, and this year I spent 66 days on the water, including the hard stuff.  Seems like a lot, but considering last year I spent 131 days out, this year just didnt seem like enough lol. I'm lucky to have the time, and a girlfriend (of 4 years) who understands the passion, and not only encourages it, but tags along many of the times."
270809,steverowbotham,2008-11-23 01:04:00,1800,thanks again everyone
270876,fishindevil,2008-11-23 04:16:00,6254,"Congrats on your awesome year steve,and all your tourney wins,as well as angler of the year !!!!  keep up the hard work next year...cheers"
270991,steverowbotham,2008-11-23 15:51:00,1800,thanks devil. I expect there will be a lot more trout/salmon reports next year...
