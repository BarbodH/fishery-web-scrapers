271116,Guest gbfisher,2008-11-23 21:49:00,0,Which came first?.....The chicken or the egg....  I like the Meegs myself but I do as well with the old Williams ice jig for the whitefish. Right beside Meegs who is of course using the original killer lure for Simcoe. Well ....besdides the williams ice jig of course.  As the saying goes. To many lures for to many fish and you can't just have one and everyone has their own fave which doesnt work for the next guy or girl. (breath now)...
271133,misfish,2008-11-23 22:54:00,29133, Hi ya Andy.(misfish doing the Forest gump wave at ya)
271136,Sinker,2008-11-23 22:59:00,8692,"I always have a rod rigged with a williams whitefish ice jig in half and half hammered. Whether its the #50 or #60 depends on what I'm after. I swear I could just use that one lure all hardwater season, and catch every species of fish on it!!!  Sinker"
271228,pikeie,2008-11-24 01:54:00,380,"bad boyz for whities forsure, i have never had to much luck with the meegs high low rig for perch with minnows skin hooked through the back or a forege minnow in silver and black with a minnow head or berkley honey worm. BOQ walleye hopkins smoothie spoons with minnow"
271251,Fisherman,2008-11-24 02:44:00,7201,Maybe someone can hook him up in the little Maple Leafs fruit suit. I can't photochop.
271252,irishfield,2008-11-24 02:45:00,26272,Don't give the bugger anymore ideas fm !
271267,Dabluz,2008-11-24 03:20:00,701,"I fish for brookies through the ice.  My ""go to lure"" is Sutton 44.  Don't even need bait.  I use it on 4 lb mono and add nothing else to the line.  Yes, it does take time for it to reach bottom but it's worth it.  Otherwise, I use a no 8 Gamakatsu Octopus hook and the head of a nightcrawler.  Minnows (dead or alive) are not allowed in my region."
271269,Cudz,2008-11-24 03:24:00,2652,Anyone using Salmo's chubby darter?  If so where can I purchase one other than Cabela's?
271274,irishfield,2008-11-24 03:29:00,26272,"Jim was selling them last year at ""Dad's"" in Temagami. He's closed until mid December though...but checking his email once in a while."

270927,trapshooter,2008-11-23 12:19:00,1234,jig/minnow or a buckshot rattle spoon tipped with just head of a minnow.
270959,wallyboss,2008-11-23 14:02:00,1095,I'll second the Buckshot Rattle spoon.
270966,limeyangler,2008-11-23 14:21:00,5204,for me its gotta be a small jig and minnow.
271016,Kerry,2008-11-23 16:34:00,383,1/4 oz walleye hawger spoon in chartreuse tape with a northland stinger.I tip the spoon with a larger minnow and the stinger with a small one.Surprising how often they'll take the small one circling round.2nd choice is a swedish pimple/red flicker blade rigged much the same.Just remember no more than four hook points.  Kerry
271025,irishfield,2008-11-23 16:55:00,26272,  ..and no that's not a small tube held up close to the camera....

271045,Beats,2008-11-23 17:27:00,543,On Simcoe I almost exclusively use pickerel rigs with shiners for perch.  Not the most active style of fishing but it's effective.
271048,12footspringbok,2008-11-23 17:32:00,459,I seem to have my best luck on just a plain small red hook with a shiner hooker lightly through the back with a few small splitshot roughly 12 inches up the line.
