270846,irishfield,2008-11-23 03:09:00,26272,"Some great fish there fella.  Brook Trout... Speckled Trout = same beast !  MNR doesn't even list the speckled trout because of this.  Brook trout (also known as speckled trout) are among the world's most highly-prized gamefish. They are found in much of Ontario and are found from the small brooks of southern Ontario farmland to the larger rivers, ponds and lakes of the north.  Water temperature is a key factor in determining brook trout habitat. They need a year-round supply of cold, clear water, as well as plenty of cover from overhanging branches, logs, and rocks. Streams with cool, quiet pools between runs of fast water and rapids are typical habitat, as are clear, cold lakes and beaver ponds.  During high-water periods, worms and other natural baits are preferred. As the water temperature rises, the trout move out of the deep pools into the riffles in search of insects; this is the time to use a flyrod and flies. Although shy and spooky, brook trout will also take a range of small minnow-imitating plugs as well as small, flashy spoons and spinners."
270852,Fishing 24/7,2008-11-23 03:29:00,709,my mistake i meant to say splake!   WOW great to see ALL these great replies from you guys!   i myself practice C & R  i will keep the odd pike during cold waters!  and the odd quebec red during spring time for a great snack!  other than that YES i do fish alot .  but we release 99 % of the fish and always try to think in ways to save lakes fish and stop the ''braconnier'S sti''
