Gerritt....your really a classy guy bud..(dont worry, I'll not tell anyone one, wouldnt want to take anything away from that gruff, tough dude exterior)  I couldnt believe you actually held on to...and returned me....Boots, I had lent Cory some 2 years back.  I had replaced them myself but there is just something decent about old friends you were used to...Thanks man!  Secondly...You and your crew had a full load going home and ...(PayBack can be a 'B') ... You fellas found the room to drive one of my son's back to the big smoke from Quinte saving me the trip...that was particularly awesome of you.....again..A HUGE FREAKING THANKS.  I dont know if you'll get this post but...How did you find the breakfeast at the 10AcreTruckStop ?? I could see you folk were a 'lil under the 'Hair'Othe Dog'...... I love it there and eat brekky there near 3-4 times a week.....plentiful and affordable....did I say great food too!. (anyone out Quinte way from the west should stop by this place for a bite..even go out of your way...NO SPAM HERE...its see-able from the 401...Wallbridge-Loyalist Rd...1st ramp exit off the 401 west of Belleville to the south) anyway......  Just wanted to say a big thanks man.......and please G...get this to Joe....

270476,Bernie,2008-11-22 03:54:00,3190,Egad. I missed this post Gerritt. Whats with the bandage on Joe's finger. He have it where it shouldn't have been? Smoke? Hmmm didn't bother me before.......but.......... Hope you guys had some good times. Maybe sometime I can make it to Quinte.
270547,Gerritt,2008-11-22 13:58:00,6129,"Pete, no problem bud! anytime.  As for Joes finger... well he put it where he should not have.... Between the bunk and the boat is one place you should NOT put your finger, when straightening out the boat on the trailer....  A great time was had by all and I got to see some old friends I have not seen in awhile.  I will be returning to Perfect Vue.  Bernie... time to start planning hard water?  G"
