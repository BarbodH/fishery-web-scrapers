271402,Roy,2008-11-24 17:52:00,13728,They included a cover when I bought mine. You should be fine with a tarp duct taped around it.  ps. I also take the breaker out so that it can never end up fighting with the furnace.
271413,Wild,2008-11-24 18:06:00,704,A breathable tarp is best you don't want to trap humidity inside for long periods.
271414,steve_paul,2008-11-24 18:09:00,658, Also prevents starting it up in the spring while still covered  FnA - contact whoever installed it and they should be able to get you one made specifically for that model for about 40 - 50 bucks.
271418,Headhunter,2008-11-24 18:16:00,5703,Be sure to leave the bottom of the unit open as it will help to stop condensation and requisite decomposition of the unit. Let it breathe man! HH
271422,douG,2008-11-24 18:38:00,2693,"I've had my central ac unit for 15 years, and it has never been covered.  My thermostat has a switch selecting either heat or cool, but not both."
271424,ketchenany,2008-11-24 18:42:00,3229,"When I didn't have a cover, I used plastic with rope and that was about it.  My daughter got her cover stolen last winter   (they dont' have fencing yet) so I just used plasticthis year!"
271436,JohnF,2008-11-24 19:26:00,3494, I just lay one of my old real estate signs across the top and weight it down with the umbrella base from the deck table. Has worked like a charm for years. My nephew the a/c guy told me it was just about keeping the heavy snow off the fan blades and not trapping condensation in the working area.  JF
271440,SlowPoke,2008-11-24 19:41:00,2984,You're pushing your luck douG. I'm betting that AC unit won't last another 15 years.
