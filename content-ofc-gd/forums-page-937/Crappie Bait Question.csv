270994,nancur373,2008-11-23 15:54:00,1211,Hey guys. Going to try some ice fishing for crappie this year. Never fished for crappie before so just wondering what types of bait I should pick up. Probably be fishing Fairy Lake in Acton and Island Lake in Orangeville mostly. Any help would be appreciated guys.  Thanks  Curt

Tiny spoons and vibrating baits like the Cicada will produce too.  A winter Crappie would rather eat 100 tiny little things than 1 big thing."

271001,Greencoachdog,2008-11-23 16:05:00,8163,  Yeah!...you know!

271055,iceslayer,2008-11-23 17:43:00,97,"Yep.  They pretty much covered it for the tackle.  Only thing I could suggest is to remember if your fishing 15 fow make sure you try the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10ft marks too.  You could be fishin at 10ft and there is 3 crappie at 7ft that will not come down to gulp your bait...   Good Luck Man!  Cheers!"
271056,Ramble,2008-11-23 17:47:00,713,my buddy swears by and at his tear drop jigs with maggots on 2-4 pound test. He fishes that area. I'm more of a minnow man myself.  -R-
