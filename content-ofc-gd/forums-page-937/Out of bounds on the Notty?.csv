270912,Cudz,2008-11-23 06:04:00,2652,Is there anywaher on the Nottawasaga river that I am currently not allowed to fish?  I haven't seen many reports on Nottawasaga with regards to rainbows.  Are there any in there?
270919,rhare,2008-11-23 09:41:00,387,The Notty has closed areas as well as C & R only.  you should really grab some regs.
270969,Cudz,2008-11-23 14:27:00,2652,"Oh I have got them. Guess I needed to know where the Boyne was.  I didn't really word the question properly and I mistook the mad river for the Boyne so it seemed like a huge area that was C and R fish. I mapquested the boyne river but the actual river doesn't show up on the map, only a boyne river rd.  So I believe the Boyne is South of 89 so if I fish in Flos township I don't think there are any 'no fishing areas'.  Just wanted to be sure. C an R is only between Boyne and Pine but I am pretty sure where I am looking is good.  I beleive I am looking to fish between the pine and Wasaga beach somewhere. Just didn't want to break any laws. Thanks"
