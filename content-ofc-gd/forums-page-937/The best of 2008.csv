It's times that you know may never be repeated in a million years that are special to me.  Thanks Wayne and Drew. I had a blast...  "
271206,trapshooter,2008-11-24 01:15:00,1234,Wise words Dan!  That's a handsome crew right there!

I can honestly say that there hasn't been a 3 day stretch since then that I don't go back thru August's pictures. They never get boring ..and may have to shoot some new ones next year! LOL Flight via Hearst/Geralton this time though.... not doing this again in Marathon...    But getting there in time for Bunk's ""Brunch"" the next day made it all worth while..  "

Your help made this trip for us once we arrived... I know the guys had an amazing trip and that may have not happened had we arrived there blind with no plan.  (especially with those big winds all week)  You didn't have to help us out, but I'm certainly glad you've taken something from those couple days.  I know I did too.  It was my pleasure meeting both you and Wayne.  Thanks for setting things up.  I think it will happen again.  In the future I'd save Wayne the flying and just pick him up in Temagami on my way through from the south.  Meet you at the launch..."
271339,highdrifter,2008-11-24 15:10:00,2534, Whoah!  I take it modesty isn't your best attribute..  Good crew right there.  We need you guys at the next G2G..  Ya outta get one going Dan!  cheers HD
