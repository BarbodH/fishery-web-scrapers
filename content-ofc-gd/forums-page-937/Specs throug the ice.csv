271264,Dabluz,2008-11-24 03:15:00,701,"The dark fish is most definately a male and the pale fish is a female for sure.  The males do change colour more than the females.  They also change colour before the spawn and stay coloured for a longer time after the spawn.  Then there is the fact that different bottom colours also will make fish change in colour in order to blend in to the environnement.  The other day, I caught a male brookie in the Saguenay river.  It was quite pale when I caught it.  I put it in a bag and when I took it out to fillet it, it had turned dark.  I guess it did not die very quickly in the bag it had time to change colour."
271273,the spirit of fishing,2008-11-24 03:29:00,141,No finer looking fish than Specs on the ice-well done! And I agree with Dabluz on the colour difference.
271283,steverowbotham,2008-11-24 04:11:00,1800,darker one is a male and the female is lighter
271286,Dabluz,2008-11-24 04:21:00,701,"Actually, the females taste a tad better than the mature males at this time of the year.  Since the males change (go into reproduction mode) before and after the females.  Many of the males I have been catching have flesh that is a bit softer and not as red as that of the females.  I noticed this for the past few weeks from the trout I have been catching in the Saguenay."
271292,tibbs,2008-11-24 04:27:00,650,Nice Job!
271335,Cookslav,2008-11-24 14:47:00,1457,"Very nice.  I love the dark colorations.. Funny how different looking Specs can be, even when pulling them from the very same spot. In the spring I got into a mess of them and had them ranging from dark browns and yellows with vibrant reds, and oranges, bright silver with almost glowing blue and pink spots....and then some inbetween LOL  Very cool non the less. Thanks for sharing!"
271336,highdrifter,2008-11-24 14:54:00,2534,Very nice!!  I'll take brookies over snot rockets any day..  cheers HD
271352,walleyejigger,2008-11-24 15:59:00,876,"i'm sooooooo jealous, beauty specs"
271092,trapshooter,2008-11-23 19:56:00,1234,"Hit up a local spec lake this morning for the inaugural ice fishing trip of the year.  We found enough good ice to proceed along the shoreline to the spot.  Cut my first hole of the season and within 20 mins had a fish on.     17.5""  Added one more and called it a day shortly after noon.    Felt great to punch through some ice again.  The season is definitely here."
271100,steverowbotham,2008-11-23 20:06:00,1800,nicely done. Gotta love those speckies
271102,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-23 20:15:00,3761,"Very nice looking fish, i don't know much about trout but why were those two such different colors.  Congrads and thanks for sharing!"
271111,danc,2008-11-23 21:25:00,4677,Beauties Ben!!
271137,Sinker,2008-11-23 23:00:00,8692,"Hell yeah!!! SWEET!!!!  I'm still in duck mode, but the ice is calling too!!!  Sinker"
271139,irishfield,2008-11-23 23:01:00,26272,Like I said before Ben... Beauties.. but I hope there's some open water fishing left yet down here! lol
271140,crappieperchhunter,2008-11-23 23:01:00,2582,Well done!!!  Getting a spec through the ice is still on my bucket list.  They are beautiful fish...thx for sharing
271141,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-23 23:07:00,2038,GorGeous specs Dude...  
271143,Bear,2008-11-23 23:07:00,106,great catch..... cant wait for the water to harden up ...... coming soon   :thumbsup_anim:
271157,fishindevil,2008-11-23 23:36:00,6254,"Very nice early winter specs for sure  !!!!...   glad to see the hard water season is very well under way up north,it wont be long now !!!.  ..thanks for one of the very first hard water fishing reports & pics too....cheers"
271161,brkygetr,2008-11-23 23:42:00,425,VERY NICE!!!!!!! I can't wait....checked a local lake out here today and found just about 2 inchs...but still kinda sketchy away from the shore. I will wait for at least another week and then its gonna be a splake bonanza!!! Good lord I wished they stocked brookies out here...
271186,Leecher,2008-11-24 00:25:00,7832,Great report and pics Ben  Real nice colors on those specks What was the ice thinkness??  Good job and thanks for sharing Leechman
271214,Bernie,2008-11-24 01:31:00,3190,"Mmmmmmmmmm. Specks. Had one for supper last night. Still my favorite fish to eat. Nice fish Ben. Didn't look like a lot of ice there Ben. You must have been careful, you did report."
271216,trapshooter,2008-11-24 01:35:00,1234,"Thanks gang.  Not sure why the fish were different colours.  The colours changed after the died but even coming out of the hole we had varying colours.  Some real dark and others lighter.  There was almost 4"" of ice.  No worries   There was some black ice below the white ice in the picture as well.  haha."
271221,iceslayer,2008-11-24 01:44:00,97,Great job man!  Also on my bucket list.  Pretty hard to find around here though.  Congrats!!
271225,wuchikubo,2008-11-24 01:51:00,1114," I was figuring the lighter coloured one would be a female, were they both males?"
271227,trapshooter,2008-11-24 01:53:00,1234,Maybe someone else would be better to answer the question of what sex the fish were.  One thing I can say is there was no eggs in either fish.  I really don't know a lot about specs.... other then they are fun to catch and I'm going back tomorrow
271233,Mike the Pike,2008-11-24 02:05:00,3421,Nice looking chuncy specs.  Did you break the ice to make your square hole in the ice or did you use a chainsaw.  
271235,trapshooter,2008-11-24 02:07:00,1234,I used an axe!  Pretty easy chopping with such little ice and to be honest I liked the giant hole!!
271237,Sinker,2008-11-24 02:10:00,8692,"I'd say you got a male and a female. The male with more vivid colours. They're fall spawners, hence the eggless fish....  Sinker"
271238,Dano,2008-11-24 02:13:00,719,"Wow, beautiful fish. Thanks for that."
271243,ccmtcanada,2008-11-24 02:26:00,7971,Wow...an ice report already!!!  Guess you did your year end report a day too soon?? LOL.  Great specs!!!
271255,snag,2008-11-24 02:51:00,1932, I thought that might scare them even when deep! Shows what I know.....  Those are beauties!  
271257,trapshooter,2008-11-24 02:54:00,1234," lol, my year end is when the boat goes away and the ice gear makes an appearance.  It represents the beginning of a new cycle"
271262,limeyangler,2008-11-24 03:12:00,5204,"Great report Ben.  I tried the lake by the side of the Hudson highway last April(Sioux Lookout)...by the tower   i didn't get any specs, but saw i guy catch a couple.   thanks for sharing"
