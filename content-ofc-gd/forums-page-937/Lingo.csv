271147,Greencoachdog,2008-11-23 23:19:00,8163,Go North young man!
271148,irishfield,2008-11-23 23:19:00,26272,"Upper would be ""up"" stream. ... but never believe where people are saying they are fishing. Find you own spots and hold them dear... like your ""pond""!"
271156,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-11-23 23:33:00,182,"BAHAAA, thanks guys I apreciate the help, and I will hold my pond Very Very DEAR!"
271198,douG,2008-11-24 00:53:00,2693,"There is a distance on each tributary near the mouth called 'The Lower'. If you proceed north for a few miles, at least north of Hwy 2 and maybe north of HWY 7, depending on the river, it gets called 'The Upper'.  An exception of course is the Niagara, where up and down refer to the falls, of course.  These tags are pretty much arbitrary and follow from word of mouth and local language."
271200,jwl,2008-11-24 00:58:00,1056,"maybe not applicable, but for me, if my posts say Upper or Lower I mean Niagara River...lower is the part that goes over the big cliff"
