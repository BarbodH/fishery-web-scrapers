270974,cisco,2008-11-23 14:47:00,597,"Hi Brian! Maybe what's inside your stomach is affecting your ability to keep warm. Try eating some cheese or other protein before getting into your stand and snack on more while up there to keep fueling the fire. I wouldn't worry about getting the weight back on due to it either since in the cold allot of calories are used just sitting there staying warm.  An old campers trick in cold weather is to eat protein before sack time to keep you warmer while sleeping. Sure worked for me on moose hunts while tenting, so why not in a cold tree stand?  All the best! Hope you tag a huge buck!"

270989,misfish,2008-11-23 15:48:00,29133, Thats four words douG. Thanks         Hi ya Chris. I always eat before I head out and bring snacks to munch on. Usually cheese sticks or a nutrabar.   Thanks bud   Sadly didnt get out this morning.

270753,SlowPoke,2008-11-22 23:06:00,2984,Cotton will wick moisture away from your skin but it also retains it - making you cold. Polyesters wick moisture and dry extremely fast - keeping you warm. Wool works nicely as it dries faster than cotton but is bulky. For extreme cold I will be base layering with polyester and insulating with wool or fleece and topping it off with insulated rain gear. http://pressherald.mainetoday.com/story.ph...&ac=MondayM

270763,misfish,2008-11-22 23:35:00,29133,"Get yer  redneck butt  up here,and we,ll see how well you can hang in the tree with that inflatable. Smart"
270765,Greencoachdog,2008-11-22 23:40:00,8163," How the hell are you going to catch a fish while yer sittin' in a tree???  ... trees are for monkey's!!!  Come fish with me for a day in August, and I'll have you begging for a blizzard!!!"
