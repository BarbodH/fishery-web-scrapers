270878,ehg,2008-11-23 04:21:00,2666,"My favorite time of the year is when things start to freeze outside. When the winds are very light from the northerly direction on a Saturday, i definitely like to hit the big lake.  Not a great start, forgetting the gas tank hose and then having to drive back home took some time away. Eventually got there and it was pretty calm   Saw a larger boat really going fast not to far away   Ended up hitting fish right away, but didn't get the first few in the boat. Buddy Dave got the first fish in the boat and it was one of the nicer ones. This fish jumped a bunch before being netted.    Ended up getting into some white bass and more browns as well        And caught more fish including a nice smallie      Not a bad few hours of fishing , also caught smaller bass, white bass and browns. For multi-species was oddly hoping for a bow, carp or sheepshead but none were caught.  Sure was cold out there though. ehg"

270903,snag,2008-11-23 05:20:00,1932,"Erik/EHG,  You are humble.   I really appreciate the effort you've gone through to produce this report.  This time of year and the planning/odds you face, With the catches you two produced ........   KUDOS!!!!!!!!   Here you'll be appreciated.  "
270964,majorlifts,2008-11-23 14:12:00,171,"Ya, I was looking at the winds today and was feeling a little greedy, wishing I could get out there again early this morning. But I think thats pushing it. Yesterday was just what I expected, Browns, double headers, and more browns. Man I love Fishing."
270979,Greencoachdog,2008-11-23 15:06:00,8163,"DANG!!! Excellent report, pics, and fish!!!  I especially like those White Bass!!! Fat and very deep bodied!... very healthy lookin' fish!!!  That's some ""Hardcore"" ""Diehard"" fishin' right there now!!!  Did you catch those fish trolling or casting?... or both?  Thanks for posting that report!!!"
270997,mikeh,2008-11-23 15:58:00,824,"awesome report and congrats on catching all those fish, you sure did better than the last time you were out."
271002,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-23 16:09:00,3761,"Very nice report, congrads on the multi species outing!"
271005,steverowbotham,2008-11-23 16:12:00,1800,"nicely donel.  Cant say as I've ever hooked a brown on a rattle trap, might have to giver a go."
271076,Wild,2008-11-23 18:52:00,704,A nice day EHG but why not add a heater in the boat?
271080,irishfield,2008-11-23 19:14:00,26272,Great stuff Erik... good to see you out tackling the outflow multi-species resource.
271085,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-23 19:24:00,2050," That's what I was thinkin! sweet! lol  thanks guys, UF"
271239,Mike the Pike,2008-11-24 02:13:00,3421,I always enjoy your diehard reports Eric .  Keep em coming it seems to take the focus off the ugly rants when the transition period takes place from soft water to hard water.  Nice mixed bag of species.  I can't take little tinny's out anymore because I flip them really well and it woud be very cold at this time of year.  MTP
271241,ccmtcanada,2008-11-24 02:24:00,7971,The winter reports start a bit earlier this year!  I remember back to those freezing cold days...and seeing a report from you in the past.  Great job out there again...those browns look amazing!
271272,ehg,2008-11-24 03:26:00,2666,"Thanks for all replies! Took these picture so thought i'd share. That little ship was really moving fast!  Thanks Grant/SNAG, I would still be going out doing this anyways, nice to share the pictures though. I wasn't expecting to catch much so it was a good day. The browns were all caught trolling, the basses were caught casting, think it was 24 farenheit out there. Sure was cold. Usually can't do this till mid January, got a jump on it this year. lol Still looking for something for the tourney as well!"
271433,ehg,2008-11-24 19:02:00,2666,"Shoulda added this on last post but... I think the colder weather and lack of any other boats helped make the fishing better, the bay is all frozen now.  Thanks Mike, i would go out(like 15 yrs. prior) and post the results anyways. Glad it takes the edge off all the biotching at this time of the year. I'll keep reporting these whenever i can get out there."
271435,lew,2008-11-24 19:21:00,12767,"hmmmm, not sure why Eric but I somehow missed this fish'n report.  Congrats, it looks like you had a great day out there in the harbor and landed a good percentage of the fish species that are available"
