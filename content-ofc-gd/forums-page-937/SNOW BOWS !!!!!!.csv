270746,jdmls,2008-11-22 22:41:00,575,"Well , I knew what I was getting into last night when I agreed to get out this morning with Sil and Berge.... I thought to myself "" high of -3...hmmm that's not that bad.  You've dealt with colder, in March so how bad could it be   ""  ... I guess the first slush fest of the season is always the worst    !!!  We hit our first destination by about 7am. There was a good 2"" layer of ice covering probably 80% of the pool with a solid slush run, flowing down the centre . Defenitely not fishable water.. Time to get to work. Spent a good hour breaking ice, and pushing the big ice sheets out of the pool.. Saw a few fish surface in the process, so it kept me going..  I guess this would be a good time to THANK  everyone  : Poly socks + marino wool is a life saving combo...the feet wouldn't have made it through the first hour without the new sock combo..Thanks guys !!  Anyway , I did the best that I could clearing the pool of the ice but the slush still made it unfishable...We walked the stream for another hour or so  waiting for the sun to peak over the hill.  Finally by about 10AM we came back to some fishable water.... The cold temps has slowed down the fish quite a bit in the last few days , but there were still some fish to be plucked through the slush...  Going on 2 hours sleep, I was still a little messed up from last nights , galavanting       Buddy next to us was  fishing with 2 beautifull LABS this morning....This little guy loved the taste off fish slime.. I couldn't get him to stop licking the chrome so I could take a pic....Sooo funny..... we all had a laugh   I saw a possible drift, so I gave it a go without thinking about a landing spot... Thank God for Sil , who quickly smashed through a 6ft slab of shorline ice to make me a landing zone... I owe you one Sil !!    This one was Sil's idea ...We dedicated it to Solo  ....Sil your getting better with the camera every outing !!   Hoping for some warmer temps next weekend.... Good buddy's make even  some of the worst fishing conditions a good time, Thanks guys..."
