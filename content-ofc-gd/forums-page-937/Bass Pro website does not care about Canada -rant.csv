270847,forrest,2008-11-23 03:10:00,1032," I agree they could have a Canadian only site, but, that is a business decision.  I think there are some business or legal reasons for not be set up for Canada because Newegg.com took quite a while to get their Newegg.ca site setup.  Now that they do its great, they still ship from the US via UPS and they do not get tagged with brokerage fees.  I ordered on Sunday and received my items on Wednesday.  I got the items that I could not find locally (checked 9 stores in Whitby and Toronto), I got them cheaper and fast.  The Bass Pro website is run a bit of a strange setup.  There are a few other things they could do first; They could tell customers what stock levels are in the stores (lIke CTC), allow Canadian backorders, allow for .CA addresses.  These things cost money, some let out information about stock levels.  I guess the bottom line is that they think it is not good business.  Maybe someone else will and then do it.  forrest"
