271123,jwl,2008-11-23 22:17:00,1056,"holy crap man,that thing is huge..I have been with people on a trip when a bull is downed, and seen first hand that the ""fun"" part of the trip is soon taken over with the work part or even trying to get your shot out of the area it dropped in.     That must have taken a mother load of work to get that one out of the bush in one piece"
271160,fpochailo,2008-11-23 23:41:00,2,"To start it measures 64 3/4"", it wasnt hung from the automatic door track, hung from a steel plate.  The gun used was a Remington 30-06 took one shot to put him down then a few more to keep him down!  Believe it or not it only took two 400cc ATVs to pull out of the bush and 7 guys to haul it in the truck lol.  They had it scored a couple days later and it got a 229.  They have to wait 60 days for it to be official but the max it will normally shrink is no more than 2 inches.  To all the people who think it was ""wrong"" to shoot the moose, it produced about 6 large coolers of meat so go back to your veggies ya hippies!"
271196,modny,2008-11-24 00:42:00,502,"  i totally understand what u mean...  for me i was never exposed to hunting in my gamily while growing up, so its different.  ive spent the equivalent of years in the canadian north seeing tonnes of great animals, so seeing such a beauty animal downed kinda upsets me. but thats only because i really have no background in hunting etc..  imho, if it wasn't such a magnificent beast of a moose i probably wouldn't really be affected by it. that thing was probably as old as the shooter."
271212,wuchikubo,2008-11-24 01:26:00,1114,"Wow, very impressive indeed! I was also thinking what Wayne mentioned about the garage motor and track.  Congrats to the hunter"
271213,fpochailo,2008-11-24 01:29:00,2,  Actual the moose was predicted to be about 5 - 7 years old...they pulled a tooth on thursday and are just awaiting the results.
271242,anders,2008-11-24 02:26:00,1168," Thanks for that!  Living in Wawa, moose hunting gets my blood plumping.  Thanks for sharing some of the story."
271285,fishing n autograph,2008-11-24 04:16:00,2540,You can't tell me that moose wasn't snackin on Roger Clemen's garbage....that thing is huge!
271290,tibbs,2008-11-24 04:24:00,650,Wow!!!  That things massive!
270656,PatrickGG,2008-11-22 18:53:00,562,"   I was thinking a .50 cal sniper rifle would take it down in one shot, i am still in Aw everytime i look at that pic."
270703,richyb,2008-11-22 21:19:00,774,I use a 30-06 and i have seen plenty of moose fall to a 308 .. I read somewhere that there as been more moose shot with a 30-30 than any other caliber.... Its all about shot placement.
270705,modny,2008-11-22 21:21:00,502,"i hate to be a nancy, but thats a beautiful animal and IMO a shame that it was killed for sport."
270706,Leecher,2008-11-22 21:22:00,7832,Other popular choice is the 300Magnum and the 270. Leechman
270707,richyb,2008-11-22 21:25:00,774,was it with a rifle ?  id love to get a moose with my bow ..
270708,trapshooter,2008-11-22 21:26:00,1234, That animal will result in a lot of meat on a lot of tables.
270720,anders,2008-11-22 21:55:00,1168,"A lot of meat indeed!  I wish i was fortunate enough this year, but not in the cards.  Congrats to that guy for a great animal.  To the other post about it walking...sometimes while hunting we only see one animal, and one chance, that could have been his only animal he seen, or had a chance. WHAT LUCK....congrats again to the hunter.  Another popular big game gun for moose is the 7mm...awsome gun for shooting through clear cuts."
270727,Jigger,2008-11-22 22:05:00,1237," Doesn't that reflect on the unique nature of this beauty? Personally, I'd only need a pic. You know, like take only pictures, leave only footprints?  Congrats to the hunter. I guess thats the nature of the game. I've harvested fish, so I can't say hunting is wrong. Just not my cup of tea."
270742,pike slayer,2008-11-22 22:25:00,1177,my great grand father had the record at one point in time. does anyone have a list of the largest somewhere? my great grandfathers last name was pratt.
270767,Fishing 24/7,2008-11-22 23:49:00,709,i could go skateboarding on that rack!
270775,2 tone z71,2008-11-22 23:57:00,1311,"sweet ,I came across some big buggers driving from Ignace to T bay @ back every night for a month a few yrs ago any idea what that monster weighs"
270824,richyb,2008-11-23 01:46:00,774,would 1300 pounds be a decent guess?
270842,Cookslav,2008-11-23 02:55:00,1457,"Your thinking about it all wrong...I understand maybe it's not in you to pull the trigger, and thats fair. But there is no shame in this at all. That moose was Not ""killed FOR sport"" It was Harvested for Food...and the proccess happens to be sporting  Many of us simply enjoy being a part of the whole proccess, from the start to the finish. Its mearly 2 steps further then visiting the Market and choosing a steak.  If it was just a Kill for sport, we'd take some pics, maybe the rack or head as a trohpy, and leave the rest.... But thats not the case at all.  Beautifull animal for sure, but he's also part of the food chain that we run. No harm no foul here to speak of...it was harvested the same as a Cow, or Chicken, but in this case the hunter chose to take part in the kill, and for his efforts has gained a lot of meat for his freinds and family. Personaly I'd rather feed my Children that Moose meat then the Drug infested Beef we get in the markets any day.  I'm not lashing you or anything, just pointing out that there is no ""Shame"" in Hunting. Cheers"
270853,rickster,2008-11-23 03:33:00,495, couldn't have said it better
270861,danc,2008-11-23 03:50:00,4677,I added a new photo to the original post.
270864,Bernie,2008-11-23 03:56:00,3190,Must have downed him on the first shot. He's using a Remington Semi.
270875,rickster,2008-11-23 04:14:00,495,That pic u added is just incredible dan What a giant 
270924,Hawg Hunter,2008-11-23 11:53:00,204,very nice indeed  Hawg Hunter
270928,outllaw,2008-11-23 12:21:00,1232,"what a trophy. i can imagine all of the good meals. no anti-biotics, no steroids. . congrats to a well harvested sportmans dream."
271017,Cookslav,2008-11-23 16:34:00,1457,Wow...what a lucky guy!  That new pic really illustrates the the size well. Nice New potential sponsorship plug too
271027,huskymusky,2008-11-23 16:58:00,10,Congratulations to the hunter on his potential record harvest. I would love to be fortunate enough to take a moose of that magnitude one day. Very smart to take a picture with the Remington brand ammunition for future company marketing opportunities.
271029,purekgw,2008-11-23 17:01:00,585,My question is how would you move something that big....
271030,muskyhunter5150,2008-11-23 17:01:00,64,"Wow, That's big. I wouldn't want that thing charging at me"
271079,anders,2008-11-23 19:04:00,1168,"Whats the story on that moose, out of curiousity?  Was it one shot?  How far was the shot?  I am in awe..i cant stop looking at the pics."
271109,danc,2008-11-23 21:14:00,4677,"There was a story by Gord Ellis about the Moose in our local paper yesterday. The paper has been disposed of now and there's no link to the story on the papers web site. Here's a few things that I recall to the best of my recollection.  Fred Hilliard had been hunting the same area west of Thunder Bay with the same 6 friends for about 20 years now. It's a prime area with a large cut and some old growth forest. These guys have seen some large animals in the past but they pass on them preferring the younger, better eating animals. When Fred saw this Moose, he knew it was a bull, but couldn't get a good look at the massive size of the animal. I'm not sure of the distance, but he shot it, waited 20 minutes and then headed towards the area of the shot. He knew that the animal was down. As he approached the area, the Moose got up (or was up already) so Fred finished the job with another shot. His partners, having heard the shot, soon arrived at the site of the kill. Apparently Fred apologized to them because it was not their policy to shoot such a large animal. It took two ATV's to drag the animal out of the bush. The rest is history.  Again, this is my best recollection of the article. There may be some slight inaccuracies.  Original article by Gord Ellis."
270426,danc,2008-11-22 02:00:00,4677,"A possible new Ontario record Bull Moose was harvested recently near Thunder Bay. It has yet to be officially scored as the rack must go through a prescribed ""drying out"" time before being scored. It apparently measures 64 1/2"", and has more point scoring characteristics that the current record. Record or not, congrats to Thunder Bays Fred Hilliard.        Bottom photo by John Kaplanis"
270428,PAZE,2008-11-22 02:02:00,132,"Now that is one awesome looking animal, congrts to the hunter."
270429,Mattones,2008-11-22 02:04:00,587,What was that beast shot with!!?!?

270436,Fang,2008-11-22 02:18:00,1330,WOW  That it just awesome. Big body animal
270438,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-22 02:18:00,2038,"That moose is MAMMOTH in size , i'm mean just look at the rack on that Beast      Awesome Bull Fred........"
270439,irishfield,2008-11-22 02:18:00,26272,What a beast... I sure hope it's hooked to more than his door opener track !
270449,cram,2008-11-22 02:50:00,1733,"Magnificent animal.  I am NOT anti hunting at all, but the one thing i wish is that the biggest trophies didn't have to die to be trophies.  Its the one thing i like better about fishing.  Don't you wish that magnificent animal were still walking around today?  That said -- congrats to that guy.  Huge, HUGE trophy."
270450,Fisherman,2008-11-22 02:54:00,7201,"Nice hunt for that chap, I'll bring the mashed potatoes, who's brining the salad.."
270459,trapshooter,2008-11-22 03:20:00,1234,Wooooooooooooooow!!!!!!!!!  That is incredible.   Congrats to the lucky hunter on the trophy of a lifetime.   You gotta love northwestern Ontario.

270498,Stoty,2008-11-22 05:53:00,2910," I tried.....but I can't help myself.......  ""a gun""   lol, sorry....."
270499,Cookslav,2008-11-22 05:58:00,1457,"That was my first thought LOL...  Then I thought... Cripes!!! I hope he shot him in a clearing close to the Truck. That would NOT have been fun to haul outta the bush at all  Absolutely 110% I do wish that very same thing... And I also wish I knew the exact location he was walking, and precisely when he would be walking there So I get there first and set up!  Congrats to the lucky man."
270501,kemper,2008-11-22 06:26:00,2232,"Im no hunter, its just not for me but I have nothing against it. That said it would be nice to see an animal like that walk, but the nature of hunting just doesnt allow for catch and release eh...  to the hunters...what kind of power does it take to knock a beast like that down?"
270503,Cookslav,2008-11-22 06:37:00,1457,"30-06 will do, and is ""probobly"" the most common riffle used. A .375 is better, but for even more impact....12 gauge sabot"
270512,BUSTER,2008-11-22 11:22:00,1336,very nice bull
270513,Roy,2008-11-22 11:39:00,13728,WOW! You could make a deck out of those antlers! Very impressive beast!

270552,wallyboss,2008-11-22 14:08:00,1095,Wouldn't want to meet that moose in a dark alley at night!!!!
270557,nancur373,2008-11-22 14:26:00,1211,And what would you like to meet in a dark alley at night?
270558,Smokey,2008-11-22 14:28:00,1278,I heard from one of the guys in charge of all the measurments and it did wet score at a record. So just a matter of proper drying time to be remeasered and get the final results.  Mike
270580,fishing n autograph,2008-11-22 15:36:00,2540,Holy crap that's a huge moose! wouldn't wanna hit that thing...
