Well I sold them yesterday, all customs, high end reels and so on.  My specialty is carp fishing, but I like to go for bass, walleye and pan fish, but I don't think I am going to spend hard core money on those three.  I have a boat that I want to use for walleye trolling, in with the new, and I was wondering what rod and reel, also dipsys or boards? I was looking at the Daiwa heartland rods, and the Daiwa line counter.  Any help will be appreciated,  Daniel"
