271211,irishfield,2008-11-24 01:25:00,26272,He wasn't sure if it was that.. or a half finished spliff.  I think Red Cap still comes in Stubbies.... but only because it's been forgotten in the back corner of the cooler since the '70's!
271234,mikeh,2008-11-24 02:05:00,824,this is an article from the Toronto Star today about what caused this Scarborough dealer to go out of business  toronto star article
271260,POLLIWOGG,2008-11-24 02:59:00,835,"The Star also reported that the car sales in Ca. are setting record #'s and the Ca. industry is doing well. Trucks were a couple K cheaper in the summer  for a week or two but went back up. The add you see here was from U.S.  Your going to see trucks built here selling K's cheaper in the U.S. than they do here same as snow machines.  They had a new van in the shop here for a wheel bearing, rather than pay a fortune for the bearing here the owner got it in Florida for less than half but it had to be shipped down from Ontario. DUH!"
271271,douG,2008-11-24 03:26:00,2693,"Irishfield, not sure what you mean by that thingy there, never heard tell of a half finished anything.  And, being borned in the 50s, I may poke fun at you youngsters."

271343,forrest,2008-11-24 15:38:00,1032,"  I am thinking this might be a good time to buy in the states too.....forget about CDN $ at par.  Not looking for a new truck, I am looking for something that will do double duty as a family and boat towing vehicle (1500 lbs total).  Maybe like a Subaru Outback.   Are the deals REALLY that good in the states?  forrest"

271057,Mike the Pike,2008-11-23 17:47:00,3421,Ya I know just got a 2009 Malibu so what happens to my car if GM goes belly up.  No parts no dealers the economic spin off would be devastating.  I hope the big 3 have a plan its time to clean up shop.  Scary
271058,Bernie,2008-11-23 17:58:00,3190,It is scary Gerritt. This also makes the one year old car value go down the crapper too. Price of used cars in general are worth much less as well.

271067,jediangler,2008-11-23 18:34:00,1923,I saw a TV interview with the guy from Chicago who's selling the Pacifica for $37000 and you get the PT Cruiser for a buck. He said he's losing $3600 per deal. Shows you how overpriced the cars are to begin with.

271081,OhioFisherman,2008-11-23 19:15:00,6623,They had a story on the news here about import manufactures leasing more land around Long Beach California to store cars because they are not selling.  It`s a mess! New housing starts at the lowest level since they began tracking them in 1959. 40% of all homes on the market are foreclosures.
271083,Marko,2008-11-23 19:18:00,854,"Thats scary. I read on yahoo.com just the other day some car dealership in Chicago had an offer, buy one car and get the second one for a buck LOL."

271155,irishfield,2008-11-23 23:32:00,26272, Less with the torn weatherstripping !
271163,pikehunter,2008-11-23 23:44:00,1659,"It's not only Chrysler giving away a truck. It all started with a Kia dealer down in the States.   I owned a Dodge Royal Monaco years ago. A guy at work told me I had to be a masochist to own one. Guess if you were to buy 2 new Dodges you would be really sick, at least according to him."
271171,irishfield,2008-11-23 23:56:00,26272,Yah... but you'd have a cheap source of new parts for the one on the road.
271175,Stoty,2008-11-24 00:04:00,2910,"Well...what do the Big 3 expect? You cant be pushing out 1000-1500 cars per day per factory, and expect them all to be purchased. Cars aren't like toilet paper, you don't need a new one every few days. They made the bed...now they are complaining about having to sleep in it."
