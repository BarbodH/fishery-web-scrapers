271093,nancur373,2008-11-23 19:59:00,1211,What types of line you guys using for different species?
271097,irishfield,2008-11-23 20:04:00,26272,"I found the ""ice"" fishing mono to be a nuisance and just spool with 6 or 10 lb Trilene... blue box. Seems to work well.. my PB laker last year was just shy of 19 lbs and it peeled drag over and over again on that 10lb line."
271099,trapshooter,2008-11-23 20:05:00,1234,"walleye - 8lb XL or XT mono perch - 2- 4lb XL mono Pike, lakers, whities - 10-14lb XT mono specs - 4-8lb XL mono  Not much of a fan of brain through the ice since it freezes up.  If you're jigging deep water in a hut though it is deadly."
271270,Dabluz,2008-11-24 03:25:00,701,Ordinary mono for water up to 30 feet deep and then I switch to Fireline when the water is deeper.   For trout I use 4 lb test mono and for walleye I use 6 lb test mono.  I sometimes fish in 450 feet of water for salt water fish in the Saguenay.
271294,gone_fishin,2008-11-24 05:28:00,481,"for most applications in southern Ontario, 6Lb mono is a good all-around line... if you've got your drag set properly, you shouldn't have a problem bringing in even a big lake trout. i don't remember ever going over 8Lb mono for ice fishing, unless it's on a tip-up, then i'll go heavier. i'll go lighter than 6 if i know i'm only gonna catch perch or crappie."
271297,bigugli,2008-11-24 05:43:00,6138,"I've spooled the ice rods with whatever we won last winter. Had a bunch of different spools. Some 6lb berkeley. 4lb. yellow stuff?, 10lb. Polecat. Never heard of before. Mustn't forget the black cord."
271397,Sinker,2008-11-24 17:46:00,8692,"P-line fluoroclear.....love the stuff!  Most of my set ups are rigged with 4lb test, but I jig with 8lb.  Sinker"
