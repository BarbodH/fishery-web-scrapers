270678,OhioFisherman,2008-11-22 20:07:00,6623,"LOL Bud just haven`t been out to the barn to check and see if your still on the boat floor. Steve, just haven`t noticed you posting. LOL American life style is a lot more hectic than the laid back Canadians can handle?  Up and att`em? what is that? FF my place is on my azz. Beer wings damn! At least I am not an elitist! Mini Cooper under control? Out"
270769,pigeonfisher,2008-11-22 23:49:00,696,"I have been strangely busy with this job stuff...It doesn't leave a lot of spare time.  Spare time then goes to the smallest members of the family, they really don't leave a lot of time.  The wee Coop is doing great, his younger bro Carson (who is now 1 1/2) is doing well and they have another brother (or sister) on the way coming sometime in April.  Tiller!!!"
