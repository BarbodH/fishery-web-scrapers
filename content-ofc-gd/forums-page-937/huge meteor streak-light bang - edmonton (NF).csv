270960,lew,2008-11-23 14:02:00,12767,"We were fishing about 10:00 at night a couple years back with a very clear star filled sky, when we spotted a meteor streaking across the sky from the far horizon. We actually watched it for about 5 seconds and then it blew apart right above us and turned into about 8 smaller fireballs that we watched fall towards the ground.  A friend was on another lake about 40 miles away and saw the same thing.  Absolutely incredible sight."
271052,Guest gbfisher,2008-11-23 17:42:00,0,Saw one just like that but it streaked longer across the sky(years ago now). Its probably on the tube somewhere as well.The sky turned emerald green before it went south and hit the earth.
271071,Silo Buster,2008-11-23 18:43:00,81,I had to laugh the other day when I saw this on the news cause nasa said they just dropped a bag of tools from a space walk a couple weeks ago.   Not that this was what it was...but thought to myself.....haha

271281,the spirit of fishing,2008-11-24 04:07:00,141,"I do remember seeing something similar however it was in the afternoon when I was a kid likely about 9-10 years old. I was in downtown Toronto playing in our schoolyard and a streak like that flew over the skyline.The way it looked, we thought it landed around Centre Island. Being a paperboy for the Telegram at the time I looked for a report and read the next day about the occurance and it said the metorite that was visible in Toronto had landed in Southern Michigan."
