270886,limeyangler,2008-11-23 04:56:00,5204,"Hi All,  AT LAST!.....finally got out in front of the house today, and skunked   Who cares...was just absolutely awesome to get on the ice....a whole 8 days earlier than last year.   Could see all the curtains of our bays resident's twitchng(not really....but i bet there were a few watching)....WHAT THE @#$#@#$$% IS THAT CRAZY ENGLISHMAN UPTO NOW....the sound of my Auger really echoed around the bay ;D.   I was gonna play it safe and go with my buddy today, but he called at 1pm and said he couldn't make it....what the hell....there must be at least 5"" now i thought...and i put on he ice picks and PDF and off i went....and yup....5""-6"" of solid...i mean really solid black ice. Even though i was confident the ice was thick enough...hell i even saw a big old buck crossing from the island to the mainland way out in the bay, i did not venture the extra 40yrds out to the edge of the weeds and deeper water, that part of our bay was 2 days behind freezing.......not taking any unecessary risks.     FINALLY GOT OUT>>>>YAY!!!         LOTS OF MISSED BITES....I""M OUTTA PRACTICE  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_2316.flv"">      BIG DEAR OUT THERE....ICE MUST BE PRETTY GOOD !  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_2313.flv"">      Almost got one out of the whole just before dark...but the litle devil got off around 2' before the ice...  darn it! Great to be out........   I WILL HAVE FISH PORN NEXT TIME!!!!"
270892,GBW,2008-11-23 05:03:00,8460,Wow.  I'm shocked it's that thick so fast.
270893,PERCHER,2008-11-23 05:04:00,787,You are a lucky guy to get out this early.I am jealous.I still haven't put the boat away yet but I am looking forward to ice fishing season.Wat to go lucky Dude. Dan
270894,Cudz,2008-11-23 05:04:00,2652,Are you kidding me?  Wow!
270896,Leecher,2008-11-23 05:05:00,7832,"Hey Simon,  Must feel real good to be on ice today..... You did not get any fish but man I'm jelous  Can't wait for the ice to get to a safe thickness so that I and the other two amigos ""whitespinnerbait and fishing 24/7"" can get out there and enjoy a day or half a day of hard water fishing  Thanks for sharing Leechman"
270897,glen,2008-11-23 05:05:00,2641,Thanks for the pics.  I am ready for ice now.
270902,fishindevil,2008-11-23 05:12:00,6254,"Well done bud !!! great video clips too,  man we are still fishing in our boats here in southern ontario !!!!  ...im lookin forward to hard water as well...cheers"
270925,iceslayer,2008-11-23 11:56:00,97,"LOL  Haha, good for you buddy! I knew you were not going to wait any longer.   It's too tough to just sit and stare.  Great vid's.  I did'nt make it out yesterday but I'm gonna head out right now.  It's been -10 here all night with no wind.  Thats like IceMak'n Heaven....   Cheers!"
270981,Greencoachdog,2008-11-23 15:11:00,8163,DAMMIT MAN!!!... it must be super cold up there for that ice to be like that!!!  Thanks for posting that Simon!!!  I don't consider it a complete skunking if you get bites and fight fish... maybe just a baby skunk.
270983,Wild,2008-11-23 15:22:00,704,I am surprised myself as there is really no snow on the ground here and it's forecast to rain tomorrow. So what lures did you try and what about structure?
271004,limeyangler,2008-11-23 16:11:00,5204,"  I was surprised it was that thick too...pleasantly relieved actually....lol.  I was just using 1/8 jigs with live minnow, one chartreuse/white on one rod and an orange/yellow on the other.   There really isn't much structure in our bay....there is a weed line a bit further out...but i was not taking risks. Its basically a gradual slope all around to the centre of the bay which is at max 20' deep.   The rock point off our shoreline has a deep hole behind it and a boulder pile that extends some 20' out in a straight line to where i took that picture from.   It is pretty awesome fishing in the spring before ice out as i'm pretty sure the walleye spawn here....lots of big pike in my bay too....just no luck yesterday.     I know...it was too much to take.       LOL...yeah...good way of thinking about it.     And Leechman.......i cant wait to see reports from the three amigos....you guys certainly get some good fish judging from your posts and WSbait and 24/7 intros say it all...look forward to stealing all your knowledge over the season"
271015,mistyriver1,2008-11-23 16:32:00,600,Great stuff limeyangler !!!  Really like the videos.
271036,Mike the Pike,2008-11-23 17:14:00,3421,OMG I am so looking forward too ice like that.  I am not too too jealous after all Badgershark had more ice thatn that on his windshield in his boat this weekend.   Now go back and catch us some fish Simon
271236,ehg,2008-11-24 02:09:00,2666,"Too bad you didn't catch any fish. Surely you'll nail some in a short while. First ice usually produces best. Nice job on the video of the fishfinder w/ commentary, you can see the fish and lure on the screen. Thanks for post, ehg"
271275,rickster,2008-11-24 03:36:00,495,hey Simon good to see you got out We are coming up there over the Christmas holidays We should plan an outing  Rick
271319,limeyangler,2008-11-24 13:16:00,5204,   Definitely Rick......except lets not go in front of the house...lol....no surprise to you i skunked...lol   I remmber last years 2 hours out there with you and Dave.   I might be coming down to Emo this week to look at a sled for sale........does your garage deal in 2nd hand sleds?   Laters...   Simon
271390,johnnyb,2008-11-24 17:28:00,3413,WAY TO GO!  I knew you'd get out there....I actually dreamt about being out myself last night.....sooooon
