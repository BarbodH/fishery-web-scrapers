That's why we remember and enjoy these memories!  douG, Hard to believe that Junior Forest Rangers and Adventures in Rainbow country were actually filmed in Boyd Conservation lands around Woodbridge, ON. A few shots of Northern Ontario thrown in for effect."

270687,Radnine,2008-11-22 20:33:00,1538,"God, that brings back memories. I too remember that from public school. I used to love that feeling when you would walk into the class and see the projector set up. It was like Christmas every time."
270693,ccmtcanada,2008-11-22 20:53:00,7971,"Never heard this before....how old are you guys??? LOL.  The one I remember hearing growing up was similar....  ""Good things grow-oh-oh in Ontario"""

270735,bigugli,2008-11-22 22:13:00,6138,"God that does bring back a ton of memories. Emperor Bill ( Davis  )  would always have a brass band or school choir to sing/play that theme every time a new provincial facility or program was opened. More important was our national theme from the Centennial and EXPO. Remember Bobby Gimby? ""North, South, East, West, There'll be happy times....."" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjiIvGpbYX8  Back when Canadians were proud of this country  And a few other forgotten Canadian tunes: Maple City http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0hWpRj7Nus...feature=related  Maple Leaf Forever "

I am a very loyal, and rabid, Canadian  Oh, and one more for the ""blue jackets"" out there:   Come cheer up my lads to the tavern we steer, To have us some more of that wonderful cheer' To the P O's we drink and the Snotties who sneer We'll have us some pints til we've drunk all the beer...."
