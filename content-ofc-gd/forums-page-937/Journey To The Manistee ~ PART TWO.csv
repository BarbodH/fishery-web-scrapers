If theyâ€™re complaining of a sore throat give them un pasteurised honey on a spoon (teaspoon) and they will be golden for a while when they complain again another spoon. it a natural anti biotic I believe and works great to get rid of sore throats. once again hope they get better.

270592,drwxr,2008-11-22 16:52:00,453,amazing report..  ..you ever keep the count of the fish you catch ?
270610,wallacio,2008-11-22 17:36:00,475,"Mikey, thanks again for organizing that great trip - could not have had a better time.    Jay - great to meet and fish with you.  Perhaps it should become an annual roadtrip?"
270625,Moosebunk,2008-11-22 17:58:00,3970,Kinda blew my milt all over the screen here Mike.  Some great fishing dood.  You're a lucky fella to fish so many world class fisheries... I'd maybe know.  The steelhead reports are second to none.  Is the Manistee your favorite 'er what?  Looks like there's lots of fish and elbow room down there.
270629,trapshooter,2008-11-22 18:05:00,1234,Now that's some good fish porn right there.  Well done Mike and thanks for the report.

270709,jdmls,2008-11-22 21:28:00,575,"Wow Mike, Those hens on the Manistee are truly the cleanest steelhead I have yet to see.....The colors are amazing and so clean/crisp...

AWESOME REPORT...I still had pics burned in to my head from the trip you made out there last year, and now this !!!"
270714,solopaddler,2008-11-22 21:36:00,8605," Thanks brother, and yeah the commentary was pretty funny at times  .  I'll tell you one thing though...the technique really works. Fish were landed in 1/4 the time compared to normal techniques.. I definitely learned something."
270716,DRIFTER_016,2008-11-22 21:47:00,10439,"BORING!!!!! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . Nice report buddy, wish I could have been there. I guess I will just have to cheer myself up by planning my Kvichak trip for next year."

270881,ehg,2008-11-23 04:28:00,2666,"Excellent pics and story. Like the vids as well. Seems like the fish were affected by the cold front, more than one would expect.  Thanks for sharing, ehg"
270932,Bly,2008-11-23 12:51:00,1556,"Thank you Mike.  I awoke this morning to sub zero temps and dreary skies, knowing that I would again be staying home with a sick little one, your report was the perfect way to start my day.  For a few moments this morning I wasn't sipping coffee in my kitchen, I was drifting along the Big M in my home state chasing steel.    Look forward to your next adventure."
270944,silvio,2008-11-23 13:20:00,433,Wow looks like a great time between a group of great guys.  Great job Mike as always the report was top notch.  Those fish are super clean and look extremely strong. hope your April trip is as good as this one.  Take care bud.
270958,solopaddler,2008-11-23 13:53:00,8605," Glad to oblige Carole  . And I can relate. Joanne left Friday morning for Collingwood with her girlfriends (spa weekend). It's my weekend to watch the kids and both are sick as a dog, noses running like taps and inconsolable 'cause mommy's away.  I figured I'd make them a treat this morning so whipped up some homemade blueberry pancakes slathered with maple syrop. My 5 year old is just staring at her plate with an angry look. My 2 year old just whipped his entire plate onto my seisel rug.  I need help! LOL!"
