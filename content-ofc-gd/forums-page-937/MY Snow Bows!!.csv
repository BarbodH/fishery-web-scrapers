271392,ranger520vx,2008-11-24 17:36:00,164,Well the snow has arrived just too early for my liking but it provided for some scenary I don't often see in November- well not 2 feet of it anyways. Made the 20 minute walk into 30 minutes through the bush.    The stone dog was watching over the river as usual.    Found the steel very bunched up in one small slackish tail-out water section with 37 degree stream temp of a large pool. They preferred 4lb fluro carbon as dropping from 8 then 6 yielded more hookups under my float. Action was non stop all day but really hot between 10-2.  Peach and pink netting and finger-nail sized roe bags.        Enjoy the spliced video below as rough as it is. It was filmed while I fought the fish with the other hand and is just a small sample of a great day-think I need a cap cam.  Steelhead-November 2008-Snow Bows
