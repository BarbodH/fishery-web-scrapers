270631,Terry,2008-11-22 18:08:00,14456,"well it had to happen  what do you think they now have c&r hunting they started by shooting the animal with a camera  but most didn't get the feel of the hunt, so they took it to the next step  hunting with paintball guns  and some have a built in camera so they can get the kill/hit photo  and the latest weapon is a paint gun bow and arrow, it gives the shooter the feel of the kill with the animal walking away from the  encounter...  so what do you think, is it for you  is this the future I hear the MNR is looking into making new regs for it       "
270636,Cookslav,2008-11-22 18:13:00,1457,LOL... I like it!!!! If they paint them all up in bright colors then send them on their way it will definatly make 'em easier to find and increase my accuracy!!!
270642,e-z-out,2008-11-22 18:24:00,1052,I like it makes it more fun.
270645,misfish,2008-11-22 18:30:00,29133,MELLO
270648,Terry,2008-11-22 18:35:00,14456,I hear people shoot these paintballs at each other too  what a world
270651,Smokey,2008-11-22 18:38:00,1278,I agree Brian it would fall under harassment of the animals and never happen.  May as well out right kill them for the possible stress you could put them under with that.  Now the archery aspect might make the game of paint ball far more exciting.
270654,misfish,2008-11-22 18:43:00,29133,You see what you have started Terry. bydajeepers.
270711,bigugli,2008-11-22 21:30:00,6138,"There's a whole lot wrong with that concept. Beyond the added stress to the animal, a paintball does hurt. Especially in cold weather when they can be frozen. What happens if the bull or bear you just painted decides to run at you?"
270712,irishfield,2008-11-22 21:33:00,26272,  Gotta stop taking you on fishing trips........
270756,Bernie,2008-11-22 23:13:00,3190, Why is that Wayne? Are you a bad influence on him?
270760,irishfield,2008-11-22 23:28:00,26272,Probably Bernie ... probably !
270770,Ramble,2008-11-22 23:50:00,713,Ok but how do you eat them if they arnt dead? lol -R-
270777,Canuck2fan,2008-11-23 00:00:00,1444,Interesting.... It kind of reminds me though of a study they did in a conservation park in Africa I read about. The ecologists wanted to study different giraffe groups so they painted the ones they wanted to study white..... Until they did that the lions weren't hunting giraffes because they are mean and way too big. Once they were marked though the lion prides killed everyone because apparently lions look for any difference in any potential prey and exterminate anything with that difference?  So I can see P3TA saying if you shoot a moose with a paint ball then the lions here will single it out and kill it first!!!! You know especially the blonde P3TA members like Pamela Anderson.
270885,ch312,2008-11-23 04:54:00,1590,those pics almost look real...
270898,Sinker,2008-11-23 05:07:00,8692, My first thoughts too
270922,Terry,2008-11-23 11:26:00,14456,for the record it was a joke...I was interested in peoples gut feelings.... I thought more people would say it was nasty to shoot them with paint
270929,outllaw,2008-11-23 12:27:00,1232,geee wizz . i hope those paintballs are non toxic. just kidding.
270933,pikehunter,2008-11-23 12:51:00,1659," Lay a picture on your plate, pour ketchup on it and enjoy.  Non toxic...   Naw, the paint balls are made in China and contain lead."
270986,ch312,2008-11-23 15:29:00,1590," i think most are aware of this. if i saw someone shooting critters with paintballs, theyd better get outta there before i have a chance to grab them"
270988,misfish,2008-11-23 15:40:00,29133,  
271014,Mattones,2008-11-23 16:29:00,587,I paintball often I told the girlfriend I want to mod my bow to shoot paintballs. haha Now that would be something to see on the feild.
271032,purekgw,2008-11-23 17:06:00,585,Paintballs dont hurt that much but they are harder in the winter and if  i where to go hunting with my gun the animal might be all yellow before it walks/ runs away  my gun shoot 21 balls per second
