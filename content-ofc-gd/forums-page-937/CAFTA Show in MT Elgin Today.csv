271077,Fishn Technishn,2008-11-23 18:59:00,198,I attended the Antique Fishing Tackle show this morning in Mount Elgin just off the 401.....WOW!!!!! I was IMPRESSED with the wide variety and quality of the show. Easily the best $5 I have spent in a while. Bought a few things(not telling'cuz my wife reads this too) and LEARNED a TON! Some of the displays were beyond description. I will definitely go again if they have a repeat in the area!!  FT
