I saw an add today for a Watson square back canoe, my thinking is buyy the canoe first and I can buy the boat later and the canoe can always be used for small lakes, so does any body know about these canoes?  It is a 15' square back and the guy states it is 3 years old this summer and he is asking for $600 or B.O, coments please ..... I think that 600 is too high what do you think would be a fair price Thanks in advance,  FLEX"

362764,FLEX ROD,2009-07-16 02:26:00,394,"Thank you for the feed back CLofchik, do you know how heavy they are by any chance?  I tried to google found the website but looks like they are down.  FLEX"
362812,angrypigeon,2009-07-16 05:21:00,31,"i don't know about watson canoes, but i think this model is made using fiberglass.  $600 is an awful lot to pay for a used fiberglass canoe.  they do not handle shock well and can crack if they hit a rock.  also, be careful because these canoes are easy to repair and the repairs are easy to hide too.  i wouldn't buy this canoe without testing it on the water first, which may or may not be feasible."

362815,FLEX ROD,2009-07-16 09:40:00,394,"twocoda, Thank you!!  This is why this site is the only one one I ever look at, the people on here are just the best. If they are selling them new for 399 why would any body buy a used one? I was going to go look at it tonight but now I have ro reconsider, or reallly give the guy a low low offer.  Thank you,  FLEX"
362969,ricoboxing,2009-07-16 17:03:00,398,"I have that same one, and I bought it BRAND NEW with oars, and those sponge things to carry them with for $695 (incl tax). That was 6 years ago though.  It's pretty heavy for a canoe (fiberglass), but really stable and perfect for fishing."
362972,jasonl,2009-07-16 17:05:00,29,"I have a 15' watson canoe and have had it for 2 seasons, bought it used and probably have paddled 500km with alot of rock scaping and drops down ravines. I love it! Its lightweight, balanced and does everything i want, but i also only paid $350 for it used..."
