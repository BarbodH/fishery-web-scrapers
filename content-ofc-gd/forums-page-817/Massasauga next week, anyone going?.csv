362688,Cast-Away,2009-07-15 23:44:00,790,"My buddy and I are doing our annual trek to the park for 5 days of fishing, camping, beer rental (on the site of course), great fires at night, star gazing and a bit of bocce ball while dinner is cooking! I took up the accoustic guitar back in January, so this year we are also going to do a bit of jamming. Man we have a blast every year. Every year my wife says ""why don't you take me up there?""  We catch mostly bass and pike with the odd walleye (avatar).  Any fellow OFNer's going to be there next week?"
362706,johnnyb,2009-07-16 00:46:00,3413,Not me...but I had a great trip there years ago..nice place.  Middle of summer and the wife (now ex) was trolling a regular old shad rap...got smashed by an 8 lb laker...nearly took the rod with it before it got landed...quite the surprise. Have fun!
362857,addy79,2009-07-16 13:09:00,573,"ive got a place down the road and go pretty often. Havent made the trek this year though...  ive yet to land a laker or a eye in that water, lead core trolling has landed me a 20lb pike and the bass are easy enough to find, but apparently not the lakers or walleye.  apparently it was stocked quite a few years back but i dont believe they took very well.  PLEASE let me know if you hook into any, would surely fuel my hunt on Spider L.  good luck"
362873,backbay,2009-07-16 13:36:00,773,"As a matter of fact, I'll be up in that neck of the woods this weekend. Bass, pike, the occasional muskie, and I got my first 'eye from that area this year. It looks like maybe we caught the same fish! See my profile for a pic."
362879,addy79,2009-07-16 13:48:00,573,"you didnt catch a 'ski in Spider or Clear lake...  were you in open water?  that would be a shocker!  I'll be up thataway as well, may make the portage in, keep your eyes peeled for a red coleman with a minn kota boyz!!  tight lines!"
362883,backbay,2009-07-16 13:59:00,773,"Oh gosh no. I haven't fished either Clear or Spider but we've talked about bringing a canoe into Clear before, so maybe this is the weekend.  Beautiful lakes, those. The walleye I got in one of the bays in the area.  On the open water, I'll be in a 17 ft Smokercraft, with a Yamaha 70. Maybe see you up there!"

362896,Raf,2009-07-16 14:22:00,3495,we may or may not..  we come in from the outside and stay on the outside.  don't venture too often into woods.
362936,addy79,2009-07-16 15:44:00,573,"  hahaha  ill be the 16ft long red blurrr you'll see as you blow by! lol  just gimmie some space, wakes kill!  good luck to all this weekend, cant wait!"
