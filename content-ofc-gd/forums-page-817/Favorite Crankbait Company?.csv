362169,Jackie,2009-07-14 20:54:00,124,"My favourite is Rapala.  However, recently I have been using a Matzuo Fantastic Minnow and caught some muskie and walleye.  I have also used Daiwa Dr. Minnow and Shad Master to catch quite a few smallmouth.  But you need to replace the stock hooks on the Daiwas -- they will get bent by a 1-pounder."
362175,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-14 21:09:00,3761,What about Bass Pro Shops. They have lots of crank baits that look appealing to the eye.
362259,maybo,2009-07-14 23:20:00,86,Does anybody here use OSP Lures? It works like charm!
362262,bubblez,2009-07-14 23:26:00,8,"i like bomber and of course rapalas i picked up one of the bass pro shop brand cranks, didnt seem that good to me though i mightve done smthing wrong (they do look nice tho, prolly why i bought one)"

362564,Leecher,2009-07-15 17:22:00,7832, I'll second Cordell's BigO in white or chartreuse..... I always have great success with them!!! The smallies love it Leechman
362573,vertigo,2009-07-15 18:08:00,37,"I prefer Japanese cranks like Lucky Craft, Ken Kraft, Bell, Daiwa etc. In my opinion, there is more thought put towards the weight and balance of the lure. Their rattles are well thought out for maximum casting distance and their depth range is bang on. They get down the right depth right away. My only knock against them is that they tend to come with undersized hooks, but man are they ever sharp. Although a little pricey and sometimes hard to find, if it catches you big fish and wins a tournament, isn't it worth it?"
362583,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-15 18:26:00,3761," Even so, for us ""weekend anglers"" 15-20+ dollars for a crankbait(lucky craft) seems a bit over the top for me...20 bucks can get u 3 nice rapalas or 3 coton cordels or something.  Unless I had way too much money and fished tournaments to ""display my gear"" to the others i would never purchase a bait of that much."
362598,Rich,2009-07-15 19:22:00,3927,Became a big fan of Spro crankbaits a couple years ago. Good success on bass and walleye with them.
362609,Domi Fish,2009-07-15 19:58:00,46,Amen!! Best crankbait of all-time in my humble opinion.
362633,CLofchik,2009-07-15 21:25:00,854, And then Fishmaster never got anymore in......ah my unrequited love of the Spro turned to blind lust as I found myself driving truckloads across the border like some sort of immigrant smuggler.  I still haven't seen a pearl Spro Crank25 for sale in Canada anywhere else.

361768,ozaibak1,2009-07-13 23:26:00,401,"Lhouse soccer's post about Rapala today was definitely interesting, and got me thinking... maybe Rapala isn't the only crankbait company I should buy from!  I mean, undoubtedly, they've built up an extremely strong brand that is now synonymous with crankbaits for most people (including myself). That being said, they are still quite pricey, and people are saying their craftsmanship has declined since they've switched their manufacturing operations.  That being said, if I wanted to buy a non-Rapala crankbait, which company would you recommend? And I'm not talking about a specific kind of crank. Which alternative brands are a solid choice, based on performance, durability, and price?  I bought a bunch of Rapalas this year and don't plan on buying more cranks for quite some time, but when that time does come, I wouldn't mind testing out something different."
361795,beertech,2009-07-14 00:07:00,118,some of the manns baits are nice.   lucky crafts are great baits.   Althought the xrap is the best jerkbait  and 10 bucks cheaper than the lucky crafts.

361811,Badger Shark,2009-07-14 00:23:00,291,Reef Runners!  Great action and anyting will hit them.
361812,pike slayer,2009-07-14 00:24:00,1177,"i gotta say rapala still has the best product out there even if they brake easier then other companies they do catch more fish. I have around 70 rapalas and probably 20-30 other cranks from different companies and i gotta say i dont use non rapala cranks to often. if rapala some how went under and all rapalas got sold out i'd have to go to with probably storm, although doesnt rapala own storm?? i sometimes use the hot n tots, thundersticks, etc. you cant beat a good old rapala, they are like cars, you get some that last forever and you get some lemons. i got rapalas that have been through hell and back a dozen times with hardly any paint left and had to change the hooks a number of times, then i've had some that have lasted like buddys and have the lip snap off first couple hours or get bounced off a rock and crack it."

361825,CLofchik,2009-07-14 00:54:00,854," I have yet to see a Reef Runner come out of the package and run true, they ALL need tuning right from the factory.  And the hooks are crap. Stupid tough baits though, and they work.....that is once you get them working.   Yup, though after Normark initially tried cheaping them out too they received a flurry of bad press and mail and seemed to have gone back to the originals and staying with the status quo.  The 1st year batch of bad baits got sold off at bargain prices, these are the ones popping up at Dollarama's and Bass Pro's Spring Sale in the jon boats out front for $1.  Hot'N'Tots with plastic lips have the same longevity as Rapala's, that is about one day.  Probably made in the same factory as Rapala's now.  My list of fav crank names (I've been off Rapala for awhile and too cheap to buy Lucky Crafts):  Salmo -- The quality baits Rapala's used to be.  I have Hornets that I've ground 1/8"" off the lip bumping the bottom for so long and still catch fish Cordell -- Best of the budget baits, use Spots & Redfins more than any other cranks nowadays.  Change the hooks. XPS -- Bass Pro did a really good job on these, nice action, the suspending baits actually suspend neutrally, and I've caught chinooks on the 4"" minnows with stock hooks.  Still early to fall in love with them but they get Rookie Of The Year honours."
361843,BillM,2009-07-14 01:30:00,17367," Got a couple of those, used to use them in Erie for pickerel....  I think we even caught salmon on them downrigging, lol"
361849,danbouck,2009-07-14 01:40:00,4380,  I can't catch a damn thing with it. But my buddy can catch fish all day next to me with the same one.

361872,Burning Babies,2009-07-14 02:26:00,150,"Rapalas seem to dominate the market less and less as you go south.  They are good, but I definately prefer other company's baits on frequent occasions.  I like Strike King and Bandit crankbaits lines in particular.  Smithwick too, if you count minnowbaits.  Mostly, I find certain baits that work well for me, rather than sticking to a specific company."

361952,Garry2Rs,2009-07-14 12:42:00,1425,"Spro makes very nice baits. Their Bronzeye Frog is the best on the market and the Akura Shad is a terrific lipless rattle bait.  I had good luck with their John Crew's, Little John bait as well. There are several other styles of bait in there line up that I haven't tried, but the ones I've used are all first class. Garry2rs"
