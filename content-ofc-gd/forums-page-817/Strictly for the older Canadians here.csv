Just close yer eyes and think back to them simple days of CBC on the black and white, and the sweet smell of home cooking wafting from the kitchen as the lasts moments of the show were played on the fiddle and the ladies twirled.  Brought a tear just to hear that  old waltz and the images it conjures up.. First time I finally found it.  Anybody here remember the show?"
