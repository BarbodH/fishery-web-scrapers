362104,Lunatic,2009-07-14 18:18:00,536,"Hi, i've been reading the forums for over a month now,and its probably the most informative and active fishing forum i have come across. So i decided to join. I live in Hamilton,not a great area for fishing if you ask me. i dont like carp fishing and thats hamiltons bread and butter. of course if i had a boat my opinion would change because i could be out in the middle of the lake catching the good stuff. I mainly fish for walleye,bass and pike. Caught my first few bass of the year last week at mountsberg,the first of many i hope. anyways thought id introduce myself.  ttyl"
362111,Paully,2009-07-14 18:32:00,712,Carp are a great fight!... but to each their own... Welcome
362115,Roy,2009-07-14 18:34:00,13728,Welcome aboard. Lots of members in your area. Your display name leads me to believe that you'll fit right in here based on some of the posts we've had recently.
362118,BITEME,2009-07-14 18:38:00,1968,Lots of other fish in the hammer you would be surprised

362131,Lunatic,2009-07-14 19:07:00,536,"Your right,i would be suprised. I know they are out there,but its not even close to what it used to be. ponds and rivers that was once packed with walleye and bass, are now filled with carp. or in many cases the ponds or rivers are gone due to construction etc. i usually have to travel to find a nice pond or lake that has a good population of bass or walleye. another bummer is the main area i fish on the chippawa is now heavily fished so its not producing much either. boring story short, i usually travell outside the hammer to enjoy a good day of fishing."

362205,splashhopper,2009-07-14 21:40:00,2931,welcome aboard Lunatic...  Keep an open mind on the carp though  Just out of curiosity... do you keep the fish you catch?.. ie the local bass and pike from the Hamilton area? If not... might as well cacth some of the MONSTER Carp over there and give yer rod a bend

362214,stan_133,2009-07-14 21:56:00,77,this is a great site. welcome aboard.
362219,Lunatic,2009-07-14 22:15:00,536,"Nope. im purely catch and release. And IF i ever did keep any fish i wouldnt dare keep or eat anything in this area haha.  ive caught carp 3 or 4 times and dont care much for that ugly fish. i often see people all lined up on the piers and around cootes with all of their carp gear with beepers and corn etc. just isnt fun fishing. Only times i like to bobber n worm fish is if there is a bonfire going and alot of tallboys to be drank. otherwise i love to use jig n grubs,frogs,spinner and crank baits. i caught a carp last year,it went back in as fast as i pulled it out. my gf loves to drag me on walks and hiking so i see alot of primo spots with so many carp i could probably scoup 3 or 4 out at a time with my bare hands and i never see people fish there. carp aint for me."

362422,CLofchik,2009-07-15 11:44:00,854, If you're not catching fish in Hamilton Harbour you need to try harder.  
362466,Bly,2009-07-15 13:22:00,1556,Welcome Lunatic.
362478,tinbanger,2009-07-15 14:12:00,1028,Welcome  I only fish Hamilton for the scenery  TB
362479,Lunatic,2009-07-15 14:12:00,536,"Thats a pretty good catch. And you didnt catch it from shore. Im not saying they are not in there,im saying that its more carp then anything. besides look at the area. fishing to me is 50% catching fish and 50% enjoying your surroundings or atmosphere.  If i had a boat..."
362514,hammercarp,2009-07-15 15:52:00,964,"Hello and welcome. If you want to share any of these great carp spots, that you have no need of, please PM me. I'll make good use of them. How about the Grand for smallies, walleye and channel cats, Bronte and Sixteen for smallies, the local conservation areas for bass, pike and panfish. If you work the shoreline of Bayfront Park for bucketmouths with plastic baits I am sure the largemouth will entertain you."
362529,Lunatic,2009-07-15 16:18:00,536,"if you dont mind walking trails,and know where princess point is,i can land you on top of carp central.  i fish the grand sometimes,my gf's parents live along the grand in cambridge so when we visit i usually bring my gear."
362538,rromberg,2009-07-15 16:42:00,10,Get yourself some cleos. Head down to fifty point or the pier or pretty well anywhere along the shoreline of the lake and start chucking. You would be surprised how many browns and bass not to mention the odd sheephead that feed shallow along there.
362546,Leecher,2009-07-15 16:53:00,7832,Welcome to OFC Lunatic Looking forward to reading your reports!!! Leechman
