Lake Mazinaw, ie. fishing!) for the end of the month  I've been here a few times before, and only caught some bass in the nearby smaller lakes.  Mazinaw is very, very deep and there was a post either here or on another ontario forum about catching lakers in it.  I have heard from many sources there are lakers, however, this is where my question comes in.  Lakers are deep in the summer, and unfortunately, I do not have a boat.  That means no downrigging or anything of the sort.  However, being primarily a trout/salmon fisherman (rivers) I would love to hook into some lakers.  Is there any way this is possible from a canoe?  Two methods ive heard brought up are vertical jigging and a three-way swivel system with a large weight, trolling slowly on a canoe.  Are either of the methods effective, or is it possible to use something else better like leadcore or a dispy diver?  By the way, I have no idea how to fish any of the aforementioned setups, just heard of them.  Also, the lake is huge, so how would I locate the depth and areas where the lakers may be?  I have access to a map with depths if that helps, although im sure many of you will tell me a fishfinder is the way to go ($$$    )  Anyway, thanks for reading, and please post any advice you may have, as it is greatly appreciated.  Mike"

362708,johnnyb,2009-07-16 00:49:00,3413,Trolling with a Pink Lady has worked very well for me in the summer for lakers...a thermometer is a really useful tool as well...finding the temperature they like is a great way to find the fish
