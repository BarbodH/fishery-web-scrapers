Today I wanted to spend some time with my dad and do a little fishing down at the Oshawa harbor, so we grabbed out bikes and hit the trail that runs from the Mid Town mall all the way to the lake. We were surprised with the sightings of many big beautiful trees that were knocked down because of yesterdays fast winds. There were many obstacles and challenges to get out bikes and rods through there in 1 piece but we did it. Caught only a few dink rock bass at the pier but we had a great time there. Here are a bunch of photos and a video of one of the ""easy challenges""Too hard to explain all of them but here we go..Sorry for all the pictures but I think they speak for their selves. What a disaster, those city workers have lots of work ahead of themThanks for viewing,MTBF"

361277,Twocoda,2009-07-12 20:43:00,4130,it was intense when it went through here ...i knew it was going be a major release by the time it got farther inland....
361279,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-12 20:49:00,2050,"wow - awesome photos buddy!  I'm glad to see you went out and spent time with your old man!  I know he's a happy man because of it dude!  thanks for the report.  Cheers, Ryan  PS. I've got the same shorts brother! They're regulars in my weekly rotation! haha"
361284,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-12 21:07:00,3761," lol, nice man. Not a bad price on the shorts either...picked up these in the blue/white, and in the brown/white. And my dad likes to keep to his self but the second I asked him he said yes...must be kinda hard on both my mom and dad to see me going in such a short time, but I'll make the best of it with them.  Thanks for the comment, MTBF  *Edit, you do have the exact same pair, took a look in your latest report."
361356,MuskyBill,2009-07-13 02:15:00,311,"Wow, simply amazing what the old girl can do, eh?  I saw some of the carnage left behind in Whitby today. Unreal."
361358,splashhopper,2009-07-13 02:18:00,2931,"  are you ""allowed"" to say the ""G"" word on this board Tambo"

361389,Sinker,2009-07-13 03:47:00,8692," Its mostly willows, you don't want them, trust me.  I'm prolly gonna spend some time removing trees from trails this week......nothing like kevlar chainsaw chaps on a hot summer day  S."

362210,Abraxus,2009-07-14 21:49:00,104, I know that feeling!  I use to work in the interior of B.C tree spacing for a few years and then 4 years as a grounds man and then climber for Davey Tree in Vancouver.  Nothing like lugging logs to the chipper in full kevlar attire on a hot summer day!  Ab
