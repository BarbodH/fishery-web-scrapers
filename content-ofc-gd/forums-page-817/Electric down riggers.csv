362220,misfish,2009-07-14 22:15:00,29133,"Whos got the best bang for the buck out there? I want an electric rigger,with auto stop duel rod holder.  I know it,s probly prime time to buy one so the prices are not at thier lowest.  What are you using and whats the benifits with your brand.  I know I can buy some big jon manuals and turn them into electrics,but been there done that.  Thanks"
362233,Uncle Buck,2009-07-14 22:25:00,1000,"I'd go with the scotty propacks if i had to do it again...  I've got walker electrics on mine with dual rodholders and swivel and tilt up bases... 1 is a temp sense unit also...  you don't need 2 rodholders to be honest with you... with dipsys, copper and lead core, there's no reason to run 2 off the rigger..."
362240,Twocoda,2009-07-14 22:38:00,4130,i run walker tournament series...i like to stack so i use the two rod holders all the time .. Things i like about the walkers as opposed to the canons and scottys ....very very very fast getting your cannonballs up and out of the away...i had issues with one unit and NO questions asked my unit was swaped out without a hesatation..  The canons were indestructible but extremely slow ...they do come with some real nice features though ...digi troll....lots of bells and whistles  Scottys make a great rigger ....but ive never owned any ...and i think they stopped making the foot control pedal for them ...  Big Jons ..someone else will have to chime in on them ..
362242,misfish,2009-07-14 22:41:00,29133,"Hi ya G.Hope alls well bud.  For simcoe,the one rigger with the dual ,will do me just fine.  I,ll check out the scotties.  Thanks"

362334,Kerry,2009-07-15 01:59:00,383,If you happen to snag a small scotty stacker release off of the 7th or 8th of Oro or thereabouts that'll be the one I donated a couple of weeks back.Tried to adjust it hanging over the side and unhooked the dang thing by accident.Kinda ruined my bottom bouncing plans that day. Kerry
