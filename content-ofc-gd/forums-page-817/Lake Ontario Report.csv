361424,rhare,2009-07-13 11:06:00,387,"I was able to get out and do some fishing on sunday hoping to get something big enough to enter in the derby. Although we didnt get anything that would break the 25# mark we did have a great day on the water. The Kings where on fire! We started running 4 rods but everything was firing and doubling and tripling up in the waves was tuning into chaos. We ended up just running 2 rods and the action was still steady and we couldnt help but doubling up! We stopped counting after 15 fish and surprisingly only lost a couple. Most fish went 21-25 lbs smallest went around 11lbs. Everything on flashers in around the 100ft mark. If your looking to get out for the derby, give us a try!
