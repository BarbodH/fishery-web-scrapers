Astronomers have detected water and carbon dioxide, key signs of life in the atmosphere of HD 189733B orbiting it's star 63 light years away form Earth in the constellation Vulpecula. Scientists have said for sometime that life would be found soon, it was just a matter of time, has that time come.  The carbon dioxide is the main reason for the excitement,"" said Mark Swain, a research scientist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.  In a separate study, published in the journal Nature, a team from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena has found the signature of water vapor in the superheated atmosphere of the same planet.  The fact that Methane was found lead to Ron Stewart conducting his investigation using APEP. Methane, composed of carbon and hydrogen, is one of the main components of natural gas, a product of petroleum on Earth, methane is produced by a variety of sources: natural sources such as termites, the oceans and wetland environments, but also from livestock and manmade sources such as waste landfills and as a by-product of energy generation, power plants.  Scientist Ron Stewart using APEP-Advance Photographic Extraction Process successfully extracted images beyond the Atmosphere surrounding the planet to reveal the surface and structures showing signs of what is believed to be highly intelligent life. Not only oceans and land masses but green belt areas thriving in what is considered a very harsh and hot environment.  On July 11, 2007, a science team lead by Giovanna Tinetti published the results of their observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope concluding there is solid evidence of significant amounts of water vapor in the planets atmosphere. A follow up observation made by Giovanna Tinetti using the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed the presence of water vapor and organic compound methane. Methane at high temperature should cause water and methane to react, replacing the atmosphere with carbon monoxide.  Ron Stewart's science team not only found water in the atmosphere but across the planet verifying Hubble's and Spitzer's result with these photos. APEP is a digital imaging system that adds an estimated 600% to Hubble's visual enhancement of images. Soon APEP will be upgraded with HD-High Definition imaging that is estimated to increase it's imaging capacity by another 500%. This new imaging capacity could lead to a new system for planet by hunting scientists.  A wide star field image of the region around HD 189733B and it's Star HD189733 is located in the center, just to the left of the planetary nebula Messier 27. The field of view is approximately 2.7 x 2.8 degrees Credits: NASA/ESA/Digitized Sky Survey 2, Acknowledgement: ESA/Hubble."
