362176,Roy,2009-07-14 21:09:00,13728,"Kinda fitting that the dudes name is Senor Insano. Our very own Jamie, ""Crazyhook"" is an adept at that sport."
362195,darsky,2009-07-14 21:30:00,586,Craig-just curious are you the same who worked for Bob on Real Fishing?
362212,craigdritchie,2009-07-14 21:53:00,1586,"Hi Darsky  Yup. I worked for Real Fishing for about 10 years, and was assistant editor at Outdoor Canada for a while prior to that. I also wrote for Ontario Out Of Doors and some other magazines for about 9 or 10 years, starting in the late 70s.  Out of the fishing industry altogether now. I quit partly because I felt burned out (every time I went fishing, it felt like I was going to work), but mainly because there's just no money in it.  Craig"
362226,Roy,2009-07-14 22:19:00,13728,Good catch Darren. Nice to kinda/sorta meet you Craig.
362305,Jonny,2009-07-15 00:49:00,1380," Wow, and I thought it was exciting getting a 12 lb pike into a canoe!"
362339,Dara,2009-07-15 02:12:00,3052,"I was almost involved in the ""glacial surfing"" link on that site a couple weeks ago. An iceburg collapsed beside our boat and we had to high tail it to get away from the wave."
362349,craigdritchie,2009-07-15 02:48:00,1586,"Jocko - I hear ya! Not sure I would want to bring something like that into a kayak with me. Or a ship, for that matter.  Roy - nice to kinda/sorta meet you too!"
362387,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-15 05:44:00,0,hahaha! and to think i go fishing to relax! how relaxing is it to skim behind a pissed of shark? lol!
362460,I'mHooked,2009-07-15 13:14:00,525, Have you been doing some local newspaper work since?  Name seems familiar from the Burlington Post I think.
362563,craigdritchie,2009-07-15 17:22:00,1586,"I'mHooked - Could be, I don't write that much any more and haven't done newspaper work in a long time, but some of the stuff I do publish seems to wind up all over the place. I just gave up trying to keep track."
362648,ozaibak1,2009-07-15 21:51:00,401,"That's hysterical, yes it must be a slow news day, ever notice how most news headlines today are about something extremely trivial? It's shameful, but at least somewhat entertaining."
