On Tues I had a guest who had never fished them before and said they are scrappy and usually go 4-6#, the first 3 were all over 9# and he lost one on a slider that was bigger. We were running 2 riggers and with sliders and 2 -82 mm Walker deeper divers. Rigggers were down 25-35 and the divers were back 80-135. These fish will only be here until Labour Day wknd and then they will be headed offshore and on their way back to OH and PA. The perch fishing is also excellent right now too."
