362200,icefisherman,2009-07-14 21:34:00,952,"Just came back from red Cedar lake last week. Don't know the Mountain Home Lodge but have good things to say about the Temagami Riverside Lodge. We were camping on Crown Land but the Temagami Riverside Lodge people allowed us to launch at their dock and park the truck there for more than a week for like $45 all together ($10 launch + $5/day for parking).... Then a guy from their interior site( Adam) came and cut the grass on our camping site - he didn't have to do it as we were on our own but it sure made the difference in greatly reducing the mosquitoes in the area. He also came and took our garbage out one day and at the end we were allowed to drop what little garbage we've had at their container. Vet pleasant people (Linda is the owner with the two sons Adam and ...forgot the name of the younger one). I was researching options few weeks ago and found out Temagami Riverside Lodge has the best prices of the three lodges that are on Red Cedar. Mountain Home Lodge and Red Cedar Lake Camp been the other two.  Do what ever you decide but DO NOT go to the Red Cedar Lake Camp - what a jerk the owner (Dave) is...we've stopped there first asking for directions/launch/parking and he asked if we are his customers. When I said that we are not, he turned around and said ""Good luck then"" through his teeth....didn't even want to talk to us....STAY AWAY from them!!!  Hope this helps.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
