362512,Billy - Curtiss,2009-07-15 15:46:00,241,I'm heading up tomorrow for 4 days of fun filled adventure! My friend's family has a camp on this lake but he doesn't really fish. I know the lake holds bass and apparently lake trout. I'm wondering if anyone knows if the lake holds any other species?

362518,johnnyb,2009-07-15 16:00:00,3413,Camped there last year...but didn't do much fishing.  Looks like your classic northern smallmouth structure...I do remember the water being fairly cool though.  Trout might be as high as the 30 FOW mark...good luck

362589,castgame,2009-07-15 18:48:00,161,prepare to get into some monster rock bass if you're targeting smallies! we did well on rock lake just trolling a rapala along the shore line. good luck.
362610,MJL,2009-07-15 20:02:00,2427,"I haven’t fished smoke lake for about 6-7yrs.  From what I can remember, there were only smallies and lakers.  Wouldn't be surprised if rock bass or sunfish found their way into that lake like some other lakes along the hwy.  My dad and I used to do day trips along hwy 60 once or twice a year for the smallies  – We’d usually hit up smoke lake for a couple hours before going to another lake.  One trip, I was sitting on a rock eating my lunch and saw a big smallie cruising a few feet away. I pitched my bait out and on the drop, the bass took it…My biggest smallie from smoke lake, I think I might’ve been around 15yrs old at the time:    My dad with one from the canoe   Smoke lake can get choppy in a hurry!"
