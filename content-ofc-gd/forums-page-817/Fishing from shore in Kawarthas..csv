Yea, sounds weird eh, fishing with my mommy, haha Anyway, we're right at the scugog river, but I don't really wanna fish it 'cause i fish it every week and I can get her to drive somewhere else, plus, hopefully no one i know will see us   just kidding! We'll be using minnows, and I'd like to get her into some Bass (S/M and/or L/M) and whatever else is biting, but she likes catching bass. If you guys know anywhere we can go and throw a minnow and bobber out in the water and maybe catch a few bass, I'd really appreciate it, I really can't think of anywhere right now.  Thanks folks."

362449,LucG,2009-07-15 12:57:00,779, Is head Lake in that area. I'm supposed to be going camping on head Lake in the Kawartha region. I'm pretty sure its a small lake. Has anyone heard of this lake?
