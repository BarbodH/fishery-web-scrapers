360980,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-11 19:32:00,2050,"Happy Saturday!  It's been a while since I've posted.... nobody bothered to mention just how much more work 2 KIDS are compared to 1!? Boy did you guys drop the ball on that one!  Anyways, last night we had a fire in the back-yard and of course myself and my sister-in-law's boyfriend decided to pound back a case of beer.....  GREAT idea the night before our planned 5:30 a.m. fishing trip.        5:15 a.m. came way to fast, but I hadn't touched a rod in 2 weeks, so I painfully dragged my butt out of bed, tossed back a couple of Tylenol's and headed down to the road to pick up Jason...    Forecasts were calling for thundershowers and high winds so we opted not to fish Lake Erie.  The plan was to hit Deer Creek for largies, and BIG carp!  My carp spot is at the far end of the lake so on our way down we hit a couple of bass spots, and caught a bunch of these little clones.  They were all caught on wacky rigs.    My carp spot is a big carp fisherman's heaven and HELL all wrapped up into one.  I found this little inlet, which is littered with fallen tree's and the carp group up in there all summer.  The problem lies in that once you hook into one, you better be quick, because hauling a 20lb carp out of the wood isn't as easy feat.  Anyways, we chummed the wood pile, rigged with 50lb Stren Sonic Braid and corn that was cut from last nights cobs.  Within 5 minutes Jason hooked and lost his first ever big carp.  He only had the fish on for a few seconds, but that was enough to get the blood flowing!  Shortly after I was up, and was able to subdue this beast!!!    Dave hooked me up with a new to me Shimano Chronarch / Crucial combo last week, and this brute was my first fish on the new combo.  THANKS DAVE!  She held out great!    The Release    Jason was up next, and what an EPIC battle! haha he hooks this big carp, which instantly heads for the deep trees, wraps him around the main trunk and into some branches.... I still don't know how he did it, but he was able to get the fish free from everything and out into open water.  You had to be there to believe it.... what an awesome sight.    And the underwater release shots      As soon as his fish was released the rain started hamering down on us and the carp bite died right off.      On our way back to the launch we managed a few more largies, this time fishing Chigger Craws, and though they were a little bigger than our morning fish, they still weren't giants.      All in all, a great morning on the water.  Jason caught his first ever big carp, and though our bass were on the smaller side, they made up for it in numbers.  Time to hang up the sticks until next weekend.  Tomorrow - Toronto Zoo with my wife and kids.  Cheers, Ryan"

360987,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-11 19:40:00,2050,Yeah brother - they're all like that in that res... Big FAT beautiful carp! haha  The largies are usually really clean looking also.
360997,Rich,2009-07-11 20:19:00,3927,"For anyone wishing to check out Ryan's carp spot, DO NOT ask him to draw you a map! He'll send you somewhere else! LOL  Nice to see you finally landed some there buddy, beauties!"
360998,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-11 20:26:00,2050, dude you've gotta fix your phone!  I was trying to get ahold of you all day friday!  ....and don't hate about the map just because you didn't catch any!
361001,danbouck,2009-07-11 20:37:00,4380,Great Fish!  BTW i thought i told you about the 2 kids vs one... ah well looks like you are managing them just fine
361018,JohnF,2009-07-11 21:19:00,3494," Yeah. The maintenance factor increases geometrically. That's why we stopped at two. I was afraid of the double jeopardy factor kickin' in - a third one to maintain (which is about 4 times as tuff as 2, which is about 3 times as tuff as one - plus the fact that we mighta had a girl, and then I'd have had to kill too many horny little teenagers as the girl sprouted. Two boys is perfect - ya just sit back and proudly smile and say ""Atsa my boy"".  With girls you say ""Atsa my girl"" but the intonation and underlying intent are diametrically opposed.  Those of you who survived raising girls have my undying respect. Don't get me wrong. I love girls. But that's really the problem. So do all those horny little Lotharios who hang around them. And I still remember what I was like in my teens. I shoulda been named Woody.  JF"
361022,alphaalpha,2009-07-11 21:28:00,475,"wow those are all some really nice looking fish, good work!"

361046,smally21,2009-07-11 22:58:00,993,where do you launch for deer creek - in the conservation area?
361053,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-11 23:37:00,3761,"Those carp and bass look flawless.  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
361069,hammercarp,2009-07-12 00:41:00,964,Great post! Thanks for sharing. Those are great looking fish.
361092,Victor,2009-07-12 01:45:00,1609,"Those are some of the best looking carp I have ever seen. Nice scales, very clean and healthy. It sure is a carper's heaven in there.  ha, the middle finger   Nice report Ryan, it'll be tough getting through these few days just waiting for next weekend to come."
361237,TDunn,2009-07-12 17:16:00,680,Nice report and pics Ryan...Good to see a post from you.... Im still dreaming of the those erie smallies bro....  Take care   TDunn

361258,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-12 18:50:00,2050," Thanks dude - I'd have to say my wife in managing them just fine.  She was nice enough to take care of them saturday morning while I was out slaying fish.   John...er...I mean WOODY - I'll let you know in about 10 years wether or not I'm going to survive.\   Yeah, there's nowhere else to launch really.  And they only charge 10 bucks for the day, just like any other launch, but there's a beach, picnic area's, out-houses haha...   Yeah man - very nice looking fish for sure...it's the first time I actually managed to boat one from that lake and I'll be going back again soon for sure.  Hold in there, before you know it you'll be kickin' back waiting for the bite.   Hey Buddy - I've kept an eye out for your reports. Some solid fishin' up where you are.  Keep them comin'."
361259,The Urban Fisherman,2009-07-12 18:54:00,2050,"Anybody have weight estimate on a fish like that?  Mine was 31 inches (same length as my net handle) but it had a pretty solid gut on it to.  I've caught a few in lake ontario that were longer, but much skinnier.  cheers, Ryan"
361260,Leecher,2009-07-12 18:54:00,7832,Great report and awesome pics Ryan Congratulations to your buddy Jason for landing his first ever Loved the under water shots.... awesome    Nice clean healthy looking carps!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
361370,Victor,2009-07-13 02:45:00,1609," With carp it's hard to estimate their weight based on length, some are much fatter than others while some are just long and lean, also there are some who has big shoulders. Judging by your photos, I'd say 18-22lbs... I can be way off though."
361372,highdrifter,2009-07-13 02:50:00,2534,Very noice!!  Tanya's parents are reading this right now...  They luuuuvvv carp.  They say healthy specimens like those would make great table fare.  I feel another cold carp dish coming up..  mm mmmm GAG.  Great looking water though.  Must be nice!  cheers! HD
362245,Handlebarz,2009-07-14 22:47:00,3790,Very nice looking water there also I dont fish carp much anymore but they sure do put up a fight I hope you all had smores with the fire out there my daughter would be proud.
