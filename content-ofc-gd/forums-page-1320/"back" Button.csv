9,irishfield,2006-11-15 03:05:00,26272,Everyone else find it doesn't work with this board? U have to click the go button each time at the bottom of the page...
10,tjsa,2006-11-15 03:10:00,1578,"and, I cannot select open in a new window in this format yet. At least not on the topics.  OK, it does work for the topics, but not in the main board area.  Hmm, I did not click edit, and my last response got put into my previous response.  3rd try, yup, its there, could be a wee bit confusing when looking for responses from people."
11,irishfield,2006-11-15 03:14:00,26272,Went to the gallery and there is no go button there...only way out is clicking the community link at top left. This aint' gonna fly Rick...to much goin in circles my friend.
13,bigfish1965,2006-11-15 03:53:00,3382,"BAck button works fine for me, but I have one of my mouse buttons programmed as a back button. Anytime you post twice in a row on the same thread and no one else posts in between, your post is placed into your prior post...make sense? It is a big time saver and a big resource saver. To go from the gallery to here, click on the logo."
15,irishfield,2006-11-15 04:01:00,26272,Not even my keyboard back button works. So if your are using new since last visit..click a thread..and then have to use the menu and go button you end up back at the General discussion area again.
16,bigfish1965,2006-11-15 04:09:00,3382,"Okay..but new since last  doesn't set up a sequence of visits..it is a search string. If you come in here from the main page to this thread, you can use the back button since you have a path to follow back."
17,irishfield,2006-11-15 04:18:00,26272,Nope...coming in here off the General by selecting this thread I can not use the back button on my key board or back icon in MIE. I have to select General Discussion and GO  After posting that I hit the back button...it took me back one page to prior to posting the message. Clicking again on the back button still won't take me back to General Discussion. Have to use the menu and GO
18,bigfish1965,2006-11-15 04:25:00,3382,"I don't know what to say, Wayne. It works fine on my PC.  Wayne..I set up a bugs report thread in the Help Area..can you post your observation there and I'll try and get the error to happen for me. I don't use IE (shudder) so I'll have to fire it up and give it a try."
20,irishfield,2006-11-15 04:31:00,26272,Will do...
22,Spiel,2006-11-15 04:40:00,9065,"....""Back Button"" is not functioning properly or me either. Often requires several or more clicks? On the upside I was fianally able to ""log in""."
23,irishfield,2006-11-15 04:47:00,26272,Yep...about 10 clicks takes me back out!  Now that I said that...next time was 18 or so.
24,bigfish1965,2006-11-15 04:54:00,3382,Yeah..I can see the issue with IE. Works fine in Firefox and Opera. Just a CSS issue. I'm online with the skin maker now and we're working on a solution.
25,irishfield,2006-11-15 05:01:00,26272,
29,dragonfly,2006-11-15 05:42:00,3,"Hey all, sorry to hear of your troubles, my name is Kim, I designed and wrote the driftwood skin, Rick and I are currently seeing if we can sort it out for you.  I have to say though, that I have IE6, and have not been able to reproduce the issue at all.. neither has anyone else who has purchased the skin reported any problems.  But we are digging deep looking for the cause for you"
31,Spiel,2006-11-15 05:44:00,9065,"....Welcome Kim. I was experiencing troubles earlier but have had no issues the last hour or so. Oh and nice skins, very nice."
35,bigfish1965,2006-11-15 05:57:00,3382,"So far we haven't found the issue, but we are going to pick it back up tomorrow or so. I've found that the classifieds section works fine. The trouble is definitely with IE and it isn't reading the page URL correctly. If you drop down the back button history, you'll see incomplete URL's. So we're working on it and we'll come up with something. In the mean time, I'll make skin switching allowable and you guys will get to see the otehr skins we will be releasing over time. The refelctions blue skin is older and doesn't have the fancy code like this one."
38,Daplumma,2006-11-15 11:31:00,1961,"Same issue with the back button here, Joe"
58,Daplumma,2006-11-15 17:29:00,1961,Seems to be Ok now.
60,bigfish1965,2006-11-15 17:31:00,3382,Back button issue was a missing iframe file. It caused IE to read the CSS file incorrectly and...well...it's fixed now so who cares.
65,Squid,2006-11-15 19:00:00,1656,What happened to Alice? was she replaced by Kim?  My first post!!
