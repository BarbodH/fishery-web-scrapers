663973,WeedLine,2012-02-06 12:31:00,322,"I know, what a bummer. I can replace most of it but there were alot of old discontinued and customized lures that had good mojo attached to them. Icefishing sucks anyways JK"
663989,Harrison,2012-02-06 13:36:00,2202,"Ouch for sure.  I didn't lose my stuff, but I know the feeling. Some idiot striped all my ice gear out of the back my truck as I ate breakfast one morning.  Lots of custom baits and hard to get ones.  Ice fishing hasn't been the same since.  Good luck bud!"
664000,GbayGiant,2012-02-06 14:03:00,1780, How was the walleye fishing at the river? I hear there are 100 people an evening out there doing good.
664162,FishAbout,2012-02-06 22:45:00,106,Not even close to a 100 guys.  Has been hit and miss out there. Slowing down now.
664172,WeedLine,2012-02-06 23:01:00,322,"Not that many guys and we only got one eye. Pretty slow on Saturday. Thanks guys, I'm sure it's gone for good. If a fisherman found it, they just hit the jackpot."
