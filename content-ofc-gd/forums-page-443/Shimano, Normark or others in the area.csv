663327,GBW,2012-02-03 20:56:00,8460,"Hey all.  Well something has come up (again) in my life and has left me holding the ""EI Please!"" sign in hand.  The owner of the company I was at passed away on Monday and thus has me looking for work.  Does anyone here know any contacts at Shimano or Normark?  I would love to get back into sales of a product (rather then selling people, lol) and more so in the fishing industry.  ANY PM's and help is greatly appreciated!  Thanks.  Geoff"

Hell, if I could grab HH now and take him for a beer (and a fart war of course) I would.  He's like my big brother and a true FRIEND!"
