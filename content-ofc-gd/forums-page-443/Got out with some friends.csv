663620,EC1,2012-02-05 01:56:00,930,I'm almost sure the sonar cones covered most of kempenfelt today. Most of my morning was trying to find my jig amongst the huge amount of interference. When is your report coming mike? Can't wait to see the pic of that last fish you got.
663627,BillM,2012-02-05 02:10:00,17367,I thought I saw a steelhead like pose out on the ice!
663634,MJL,2012-02-05 02:20:00,2427, Funny thing is I’m hoping to buy or build a new ice rod to stick my 4” centrepin on just for fun. I wonder how it’s going to be like to retrieve the lure from 100+ feet with a 1:1 ratio...  Think about the drag free descent the bait will have going through the water column.LOL
663640,BillM,2012-02-05 02:50:00,17367,A little 3.5in pin would be great out there..  I'd just make sure it's got a strong clicker so you don't have to hold onto it all the time.  Or you could always use an elastic.
663734,limeyangler,2012-02-05 14:20:00,5204,Good report Brian....looks like a fun time!
663762,LeXXington,2012-02-05 16:34:00,1928,Nice going guys..    :clapping:
663810,NAW,2012-02-05 22:07:00,4022,Nice report Brian!  Great to see you guys getting out for some fun
663949,Moosebunk,2012-02-06 05:54:00,3970,"Great stuff Brian and fisher doods Andy, Lloyd and Terry!!!"
663524,misfish,2012-02-04 19:25:00,29133,"Couldnt asked for a better day to be out on the hard water.Good friends and great weather and even some fish.  This guy knows how to catch fish.    Hole shot.    A nice natural laker released to play another day.    Andys young lad Matt,nailed a nice fish aswell. On the side hooks as you can see.     I hooked into a nice fish,but my MONO broke.  Terry well,was Terry.Praying to the gods.LOL      Andy not sure as Terry and I had to leave early.  Good to see everyone again.  As for back ground shots,there were a 1000 guys out there,so Im sure the WWW will see it,s share.LOL"
663527,Joey,2012-02-04 19:28:00,9122,Awesome!!!  Guess the ice was not too thick as I see no snowmobiles
663531,irishfield,2012-02-04 19:34:00,26272,"Good to see it was a great morning on the ice! I, unfortunately, got stuck in the shop...  .... I'll tell yah now though, the guy that arranged that ""mission"" is gonna kill ya for the pictures!  Oh.. and Terry, I sometimes wonder if he's part budda !   Guess those hooks I gave him on Thursday, so that he had something to fish with, didn't do him any good!!"
663532,misfish,2012-02-04 19:35:00,29133,"No snow either J.There was a set of tracks,but I wouldnt be."
663535,misfish,2012-02-04 19:36:00,29133,"  Like I said Wayne,1000 guys out there. Irt,s not a secret.LMAO."
663536,bushart,2012-02-04 19:39:00,2628,Beauty trout Bri
663537,Sinker,2012-02-04 19:40:00,8692,"Nice work guys! Tell that Andy fella I says HI!  Never jig whities without the side hooks. 90% of the time, that's what gets them. And always right in the face, just like Matt's!  S."
663538,Leecher,2012-02-04 19:48:00,7832,Sounds like you all had a great time on the hard stuff Brian Nice laker by this guy and whitie Thanks for sharing Jacques
663539,Roy,2012-02-04 19:51:00,13728,Great report and that Matt lad is a good hockey player too!
663541,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-04 19:53:00,2690,"Good stuff Brian.  Too bad about the snapped line.  ""That guy"" sure does well on the hardwater...pretty darn good at finding 'em in his boat, too!"
663547,bigugli,2012-02-04 20:16:00,6138,"Well done.  place looks vaguely familiar  The side hooks on the Williams I bought are absolute garbage. Fresh out of the pack, the one side hook snaps apart as I swing it out."
663565,BillM,2012-02-04 21:20:00,17367,  I'm glad I could make an appearance    I was fishing 100ft from you guys.  Top left! LOL
663577,misfish,2012-02-04 22:08:00,29133,LOL Bill. How did ya make out? Seen alot of running .LMAO
663578,mercman,2012-02-04 22:16:00,7054,Good stuff Guys You had a beauty day too
663580,BillM,2012-02-04 22:21:00,17367," Those 4 guys south of me were running all over the place, lol!   I got 3 small lakers, nothing to write home about..  I wanted to stay deeper then everyone else, but everytime I iced a fish, I seemed to get more and more company..  Finally pulled up and went a bit east of you guys to finish the day..  WAY too many guys out there for my liking..  I think I'll be fishing steelhead tomorrow."
663582,misfish,2012-02-04 22:24:00,29133, Ya  Im heading that way as well in the AM.
663585,davey buoy,2012-02-04 22:48:00,5505,"Looks as thou you had a great day,when was the last time you were on the lake in early February with no snow?"
663586,misfish,2012-02-04 22:51:00,29133, And felt like you were fishing in March.
663589,kickingfrog,2012-02-04 23:23:00,8333, 2002 morning of the gold medal game. Skated from tiffin to the point. Great day!
663602,MJL,2012-02-05 00:27:00,2427,"Sweet Brian  Despite the crowds, it was a nice day to get out. Even witnessed my first on-ice argument amongst the crowds (no gloves were dropped) - From what I gathered, parking yourself right next to someone else you don't know and switching on a Marcum LX-5 is not so good for other people's sonars  It was entertaining nonetheless.  The Williams is 1 lure I have yet to catch anything on...I'm probably doing something wrong"
663606,BillM,2012-02-05 00:53:00,17367," Mike, I saw a very similar conversation like that as well.  I wouldn't doubt we were listening to the same guys..  Was the loud mouth in a black two piece?  Any chance one of your buddies was fishing out of a Clam? (Not flip over)  I heard the name 'Mike' mentioned a few times, was wondering if it was you, lol."
663611,misfish,2012-02-05 01:11:00,29133,"I went out blind.Left,my finder at home.I did have FH tell me there were fish around as he was 2-3 arms reach away, as was Terry.LOL"
663613,BillM,2012-02-05 01:13:00,17367," Dude that sucks!  Especially when 95% of those fish come on the chase..  I hate fishing blind, especially in 120ft of water with a wicked current, lol."
663615,MJL,2012-02-05 01:18:00,2427," That may have been me.LOL  I was trying to learn the ways of the laker chase...A few times when people started to get close with their sonars, I got trigger happy and prematurely started cranking on their interference.LOL"
663618,BillM,2012-02-05 01:38:00,17367,"LOL!!!  Yeah that happened to me today as well..  I'd have my bait suspended 15ft or so above bottom and thought HOLY CRAP HERE IT COMES!!  Then I look over and some guy has his flasher 50ft from me, lol.  I had a fish today rocket up from 120ft to hit 20ft below the hole.  As soon as I dropped it down the hole, he came flying off the bottom..   It's too bad he was about 3 lbs!"
