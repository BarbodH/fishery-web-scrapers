664097,rufus,2012-02-06 18:59:00,267,"My wife renewed her 3 year Outdoors Card and 3 year fishing licence around the same time that I did. When she paid online she didn't bother to print the e-licence as she thought it was temporary until her real card and licence would arrive in the mail - just like every year. When her card arrived without the licence - because she is not an Ontario resident - and we realized that the e-licence was meant to be carried around for 3 years - she went back online to see if she would be able to print it off. There is no way to do that.  At that point she sent off an email and today received a reply.  If you are a non-resident of Ontario there will be no licence mailed to you.The e-licence is meant to be printed from your home computer after thepurchase.  If you did not save a copy of the licence or print it outafter the transaction, you will need to obtain a replacement at aService Ontario office offering Ministry of Natural Resources servicesor at a local issuer in Ontario.  For a list of such locations, pleasevisit our website ontario.ca/outdoorscard.  There will be a replacementfee of $10.50. Non residents be warned!"
664121,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 20:41:00,5865, In order to print this temp license you had to download it first....look on your computer to see if it's in your download files.
664127,rufus,2012-02-06 20:59:00,267,She never bothered to download it - we checked. I imagine there will be a lot of people in the same boat in that if you don't plan on actually fishing until the spring you wouldn't bother to download what you believe to be a temporary licence. When you renew there is nothing noticeable that indicates that the licences are different than they have been in previous years so one just assumes the licence will come in the mail along with the Outdoors Card like it always has.
664134,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 21:21:00,5865,"That's too bad........just checked the one I printed and it does say Temp Outdoors Card and Fishing License.......so it's a good thing I printed it....but it's a friggen huge 8x10"" piece of paper I have to carry around in my wallet....this is another step BACKWARDS by government..."
664141,rufus,2012-02-06 21:34:00,267, I is like no one at MNR has ever been fishing....  I shrunk mine down when printing and folded it over the Outdoors card so it fits in the wallet. It will not last 3 years though so I plan on reprinting it every once in a while.
660314,captpierre,2012-01-25 21:54:00,2521,Renewed our cards and fishing licences on-line before Christmas and haven't received them yet.  Anybody else have this problem?  Good thing I don't ice fish.
660316,NAW,2012-01-25 21:59:00,4022,I did mine the first week of Decemember.  Still nothing.
660334,ccmtcanada,2012-01-25 22:42:00,7971, If you renewed online you can use the printed version until your new card arrives in the mail.
660339,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-25 22:54:00,130,STILL WAITING...GOT MY PRINT OFF IN MY WALLET...AND ICE FISHING...DON'T GET ME STARTED
660342,MJL,2012-01-25 23:10:00,2427,I renewed mine online the last week of November and got mine on Monday.
660578,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-26 14:16:00,535,Bought mine in mid December and still haven't received it. My printer was broken so I couldn't print off the temp either. I emailed them but all they said was it should arrive late January so hopefully this week I'll get it. I was told in the meantime I can buy a replacement card for $10 if I want to go fishing before then. Thanks!
660584,fishingfarmer,2012-01-26 14:31:00,34,I also did mine on line in December.Still waiting.Just another government screw up.
660587,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-26 14:44:00,2690,"  Yup, the paper one is fine.  The better half had to use it at Nipissing last week for a spot check.  Yup, STILL waiting...close to two months now."
660588,BillM,2012-01-26 14:50:00,17367, You're blaming the government because you ran out of ink on your printer?
660613,mike rousseau,2012-01-26 15:42:00,4661,Things change from time to time...  A little patience goes a long way...  And as far as I know the MNR database shows if you have a valid licence... And friend and I got checked one day and he forgot his licence... MNR officer called in buddy's name... Good to go...
662669,rufus,2012-02-02 01:26:00,267,"I ordered my 3 year Outdoors Card and 3 year licence back in December and yesterday received my envelope with the outdoors card. It is different than the old system. With the old system the licence tag would be printed on the back of the Outdoors Card - not anymore. At least not for out of province Canadians like me.  What I thought was a temporary license - the e-license that I printed off - is not temporary by the looks of things. That is the actual licence that is to be carried along with the Outdoors Card.... an 8.5 x 11.5 piece of paper that I am supposed to carry in my wallet... for the next 3 years. What the hell??  If this is correct, I have just one question. What idiot thought this up?  Someone please tell me this isn't so - that the website is wrong.  By the way, if you send them an email you get an autoreply saying the will respond in 15 days. Again... What the hell??"
662677,mike rousseau,2012-02-02 01:36:00,4661,In province 3 year was printed on my new card...  That really sucks...  I hate bulky wallets...
662681,rufus,2012-02-02 01:43:00,267,It is absolutely nuts! If you are unable to print of the e-licence they will be happy to print it off for you and mail the e-licence to you. Well that is just wonderful.... I may was well put a big frame around it and wear it around my neck as it sure as heck will not fit in my wallet...  Has anyone down there ever actually been fishing?
662689,ckrb2007,2012-02-02 01:53:00,449,Ordered mine online Dec. 30th and received my card in the mail Jan 30th. I think I can live with a month turn around time.
662696,richyb,2012-02-02 02:02:00,774,I ordered mine online the first week of december. Got it in the mail today and its the same as it always has been. Whats supposed to be different ?
662703,rufus,2012-02-02 02:12:00,267, It is different for Canadian residents but not for Ontario residents by the looks of it.  I imagine that for most Canadian residents this will not be a major issue as they would only need to carry the e-licence in their wallet for their annual week long fishing trip to Ontario. For those of us that are from Winnipeg and use North West Ontario as our playground all summer and every weekend in spring and fall - I don't think carrying a full sheet of printer paper around in the wallet for 3 years is workable. The paper wouldn't last longer than a month in my wallet much less 3 years.
662721,ctdd2006,2012-02-02 02:29:00,531,I went to my bait shop and renewed on Jan 4 and got my card yesterday!  I was surprised.  The card is the exact same...silly beaten to death question...but do I still need to carry that big yellow stampy sticker thing too??
662752,Sinker,2012-02-02 03:51:00,8692," Same here. Got it Jan. 4th, card came jan. 29th. Not bad at all, but getting my license renewed was a bit of a run around.....  I think your supposed to carry the yellow stampy sticker thing with your card. Not really sure, but mine has a little sticky tab on it that sticks to my card real nice, so I'm just going to keep it there.  S."
662773,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-02-02 06:45:00,535,"  I'm blaming the government for being inept. It's not like they were suddenly hit with the problem of creating licences, people were going to want/need them. ANY other time you buy something online, you get an email confirmation/receipt. Boater's exam, I got an email where I could print off the temporary licence afterwards if I lost/damaged it, or if I did it on a computer without a printer hooked up. Good setup, simple, effective. Yet the MNR can't do something as simple and straight forward as that? Especially since they knew there would be trouble getting the licences? Honestly, it seems like it's being run by a bunch of amatuers and this whole situation (NEEDING to legally have a licence that aren't even available to fish) is a joke. I never knew at the time I bought my licence online that it would take almost 2 months to deliver, either. By the way, I have plenty of ink, my printer just won't work. Turns on, but won't print. Don't even get me started on governments...."
662793,Billy Bob,2012-02-02 11:39:00,5865," I agree 100%......I can get order something online and that product, even a fairly large product can be at my door in 2 days to 5 days from across the country without fail....but for a small piece of paper to arrive in my mail box from the MNR takes 1-2 months is really unacceptable in today's computer generated world....btw I'm also waiting 1 month now.....doesn't make any sense to me....they received payment as I already had to pay the cc bill but they can't send what I order from them in a reasonable time. This is a perfect example of how government does it's job...  Bob"
662816,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-02 13:03:00,2690,"Looks like they are finally sending them out, Juli got hers early this week + I've heard/read of a few other guys/gals receiving them. For the record we were checked twice (Nipissing and Simcoe) no problem with the paper temporary license...other than it was a pain in the you know what, folded up in my wallet."
662854,rufus,2012-02-02 14:24:00,267, Now imagine having to carry that in your wallet for 3 years as I am expected to do as a non Ontario resident.
662859,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-02 14:30:00,2690,"  Yeah, just silly.  Nobody ever said, at least I haven't, government agencies make good decisions."
662870,johnnyb,2012-02-02 15:15:00,3413,Renewed online in the last week of December....arrived in the mail yesterday
662896,NAW,2012-02-02 16:13:00,4022,X2.  Glad it finally arrived.  I can take that stupid peace of paper out of my wallet!
