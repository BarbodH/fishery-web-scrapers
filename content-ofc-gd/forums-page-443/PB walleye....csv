663092,mike rousseau,2012-02-03 02:05:00,4661,Well the girlfriend got off early today... So I got to go fishing tonight...  Well me and a buddy fished for about an hour before we marked our first fish.. Wich refused our offerings... And so did the next 5 marks... We tried everything...  Again... I decided to use my go to lure... And work on the cadence...  Finally get I bite... Swing and a miss... Got my minnow...  Rebaited and dropped... Bang got him that time... A nice 18-20 incher...  Soon after my partner got SMOKED on his lindy darter... I guess they do work...lol  I get cracked again... Feels huge... I'd gain 3-4 feet and she would take it right back... Work her up 20 feet and POP... Hook pulled....  I was devastated....  As I rebait I watched the beast swim back down... I dropped my bait back down... And before the fish made it to the bottom it saw my lure again... That's right... It hit again!!!!! After I just lost it seconds before...  This time I got it up to the hole... OMG... Beast... I wasn't sure if it would fit through the 6 inch hole...  We got her through the hole barely...  She went 31x18 wich is 12lbs on the calculator... My new PB  We later iced 2 more 18-20 inchers...  What a great night
