(There was about 5 inches black and 5 more white) About 20 people out ... most on foot where I was near Port Carling on lake Rosseau. Ice is tight - No slush, no snow ... WEAR your CLEATS ... its slippery.  2. Minnows are available close by (in Glen Orchard)... 'Bait on the Lake' has changed hands .. Jay, the new owner seems like a nice guy has plenty of Minnows and has expanded the store to have a bunch more fishing gear available.  He tells me he ALSO has a store in Mactier (About 4 miles away) that opens at 5:00 AM for Minnows   Happy fishin !   3. My report ... 2 hours - three hits - 0 iced ... saw a couple nices lakers taken in that time... went to the cottage... had a duck dinner that couldn't be beat and didnt get up until the next morning."
