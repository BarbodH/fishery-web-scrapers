663544,lxt,2012-02-04 20:01:00,7,"so, since the first weekend of January we have been going to Island lake in orangeville. Now after fishing this lake for several weekend its getting rather boring so im looking for a new lake to try out so if anyone has any suggestions that would be great, also we prefer to catch pike over any other species so if u know a good pike lake close to Toronto let me know please  thanks."
663556,DOS,2012-02-04 20:42:00,119,"Just head west from Island lake towards Fergus and give Belwood a try, walleye in there also.  You can try Conostogo too..    RED"
663607,Rizzo,2012-02-05 00:53:00,4754,little lake in Barrie or Lake St John near the casino
663610,BillM,2012-02-05 00:56:00,17367,Cooks Bay on Simcoe for pike.
663693,Acountdeleted,2012-02-05 08:46:00,2562,Out of curiosity how has Island lake been? I've been meaning to go for weeks but cooks bay has repeatedly stolen my interest.
663757,Beans,2012-02-05 15:47:00,3339,Frenchman's Bay out by Pickering might be worth a shot...don't know how the ice is but maybe someone here can help...big jumbo perch come in from Lake O and there are some nice pike to be had...
663970,tightline,2012-02-06 12:26:00,322," Ummmmmmmm No walleye in those lakes  , small small pike and the odd perch can be found though"
664085,dsn,2012-02-06 18:34:00,1018,Forget about ice fishing. Theres a lot of places now with open water that hold huge pike In lake O.
664154,hookerdown,2012-02-06 22:15:00,110,"Depending on where in the GTA you are, Lake Simcoe would more than worth it.  Island Lake is about 45 mins from Mississauga, Cooks Bay on Simcoe is about an hour, more than worth the extra 15 mins."
