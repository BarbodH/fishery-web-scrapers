Perfect    A couple of stops for gas and hot beverage and the way I go.  Departure time & temp    As I'm making my way up, temp was getting colder    upon arriving, a quick check on the thermometer and reading was -18C  Proceeded to get setup, got the gear out of the car, looked at the snow bank on the side of the road next to the car and again had to brake trail to get on    thank god I brought a shovel this time to make the job easier  Once on ice, punched my first hole, ice was a good 12"" thick with a blanket of fresh snow on top but under... slush    Quickly setup a dead stick and dew worm... was about to proceed to the second hole when I noticed the dead stick quick strike go off  Iced my first minnow size trout   Not badly hooked, back down it goes... put another worm on and punched my second hole... again dead stick goes off... iced my second minnow size trout    back down it goes   Got a third and this is when I switched to salties  Dead stick tipped with salties had the upper hand... iced 3 for the pan, all had the minnow down deep   but biting very lightly, one, I even pulled it onto the ice without setting the hook  Here's my guests for the pan    Closer shot of the salty sticking out    All in all was a great time out on the hard stuff!!! Hope you enjoy Tight lines Leechman"
