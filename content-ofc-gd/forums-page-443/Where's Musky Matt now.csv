663650,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-05 03:09:00,0,yayaya. sens fans don't disappear after one game... amazing how leaf fans can reappear after one!
663654,Tom McCutcheon,2012-02-05 03:12:00,627,I think all the TO fans must have been in Ottawa tonight. Even Alfie was getting booed in his own building
663656,[email protected],2012-02-05 03:13:00,119,"maybe the fans don't disappear after one game, but the team sure dissapeared after one period.  I love the fact we smoked em.  That's what 6 straight losses.  What a joke!!"
663659,Tom McCutcheon,2012-02-05 03:16:00,627," Actually i am a Rangers fan, but haven't done much cheering since the 93/94 season. Not a lot of cheering before that either....."
663664,kickingfrog,2012-02-05 03:25:00,8333, That's been happening for 10 years.

663676,irishfield,2012-02-05 04:31:00,26272," He's hitchhiking out of Kanata, with a sign that says ""I use to be a Sens fan.. can you get me back to Chesterville!"""
663678,muskymatt,2012-02-05 04:37:00,2608,"Yeah yeah yeah!!!  I'm here...  :stretcher:  and a little battered.  Not much to brag or boast about tonight for me. totally beaten by the laffs tonight, hands down. Hats off to the laffs! My sens they did suck bad tonight.  alas...we will meet another day...  "
663680,[email protected],2012-02-05 04:40:00,119,"no worries, we'll beat your senoritas again next time too....."
663683,tb4me,2012-02-05 04:51:00,3295,Great game tonight!! Reims was solid stopping 46 shots.Kessel seems to have come out of his slump with a 3 point night! Go Leafs Go.. They are going on  tear like no other this year..
663689,manitoubass2,2012-02-05 06:49:00,11391," MM man'd up.  I'm a Leafs fan, but I love how you stir the pot. Kudos to you for being a good fan, even though it is Ottawa, lol.  When they asked where you were, I was gonna say busy, riding the bike, hehehe.   "
663708,bushart,2012-02-05 12:24:00,2628,Matt  You bet they sucked ---and a reminder about jinx's---that lady always makes a guy eat his words if they don't wait till the race is over.  It's like--I nay said a word when the leafers were singing about 1st place in November
663717,muskymatt,2012-02-05 13:19:00,2608," There's a lot of truth in that, however, I just like the rivalry and bashing the leafs cause they're so easy to bash...  Go Sens Go  "
663744,Pigeontroller,2012-02-05 15:10:00,2793,I sure hope there's a LEAFS-SENS series in the playoffs...Cause we all know how well the Sens do against the Leafs in the post season...
663745,[email protected],2012-02-05 15:11:00,119,"easy to bash on the Internet, not so easy to beat on the ice !! btw - 6 straight losses, correct??"
