Headed out to my favourite pikin' hole at first light this morn and reached my spot a little after sunrise. It was perfect!!! Not a soul around, zero wind, sunshine and a tropical -3C!! A far cry from the cold air that was around for the last couple of weeks (good thing I was sick)  Got set up and had a dead stick with a quick strike rig and either a large Peamouth or a Cisco. And had my first fish before the bait got to the bottom!!! Released a small pike, reset and went to my hut to jig. Over the first hour or so I managed about 10 fish with the majority being wee babies under 24"". Not good. You don't generally get the big girls when the little guys are around.  Had a decent fish on the dead stick that was about 36"". Things are looking up. A little later I iced one that reached 41"". That's more like it.  Then it died off. No bigun's, no babies, nuthin'. About an hour passed before I started catching babies again. About an hour before I decided to leave I got another hit on the dead stick, on my last big bait. Run over, set hook and do battle with my PB ice pike!!! A super fat 44 incher!!!  Now on to the pics.  My first 40+ of the day.    And my second big fatty AKA Pikasaurus Rex!!!      It sucks trying to get a decent pic when you're alone. Back at 'er in the morn. Hitting a different lake in the hopes of icing a big laker."
