663827,camillj,2012-02-05 22:47:00,1988,Heh .. Catskills ??? Who noticed the Mountains .. All I could focus on was the 'riser' to the right of the 'hills'  Nice Brookie !!!
663889,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-02-06 02:21:00,1362, The risers were non stop teasers!!
662678,Rustic-Fisher,2012-02-02 01:36:00,826,"Drop me a Pm if anyone is interested in following logging trails until your lost, stuck or hit a washout  preventing further travel, bushwhacking through what seems like an impenetrable forest,this may include having a canoe over your head. Choking on mosquitoes and black flies until you feel you might lose your mind, breaking hundreds of dollars in gear over the years. And my personal favourite.... doing all the above and only catching rock bass or perch in a lake that was a sure bet. After 20 years of this I still enjoy heading out and punishing myself for a day or two looking for these different back lake gems, and be assured we have found them some of the better lakes are even within 2.5hrs of Barrie which make great day trips.

662799,solopaddler,2012-02-02 12:09:00,8605,Im in.
662802,Billy Bob,2012-02-02 12:25:00,5865,I'm in....with you doing all that work it sounds like a easy portage for me....
662820,Rod Caster,2012-02-02 13:17:00,5784,"2.5 hrs north of barrie? hey, I'm already there! I know a few goods ones if your looking around zone 11. I just need a yoke on my Sportspal and I'm good to go"
662882,4x4bassin,2012-02-02 15:50:00,1025,I'm in too
662884,Harrison,2012-02-02 15:58:00,2202,I'm in.  During the week is better for me.
662889,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-02 16:01:00,2690,"One of the crappy things about my job, is I miss out on all that spring fun.  Pretty much impossible to get time off from early April until July 1st, other than Saturday each week. For those that go, spray a little Deep Woods (or Muskol) for me!!!"
662932,SirCranksalot,2012-02-02 18:02:00,3291,"Sounds pretty normal to me---do you still have room? But any deerflies, I'm out"
662992,Joeytier,2012-02-02 21:31:00,3990,"I'm in!  It sounds like Spring 2011 for me, especially the part about rock bass and perch."
663081,Rustic-Fisher,2012-02-03 01:37:00,826,Nice Glad to see others enjoy the punishment of back lakes fishing!!! R
663084,NAW,2012-02-03 01:41:00,4022,That's funny you mention that.  My fishing partner has been wanting to hit some back lakes.  He's also from Innisfil..  I'd be more then down.  But I work to much  :wallbash:
663093,Sinker,2012-02-03 02:06:00,8692,I still need to ice a few before I get the spring troutin' itch going!  S.
663224,torco,2012-02-03 15:17:00,656,I wish I could be in I love springs trips to back lakes and places like Algonquin.  But the new baby arrives in April and then year end is May. The only draw back of this job is that the end of April and May are almost a write off for getting time off to go fishing. I might be able to slip a day in on the weekend but not enough to get outside of the general area.
663443,mikeseb,2012-02-04 04:41:00,201,sounds like my kinda fishing.  No pain no gain !!
663451,Sinker,2012-02-04 06:02:00,8692,"Lots of willing guys, but do any of you have pics to share? I'll take any of ya's along, as long as we're fishing YOUR spots                                                    You guys got any pics?  S."
663454,Rustic-Fisher,2012-02-04 11:15:00,826,That's what Iam talking about!! Nice pics
663475,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-04 14:15:00,2690,"Sinker, my stomach just growled thinking about some of those specks in the pan."
663500,ehg,2012-02-04 17:05:00,2666,"That is one of the most impressive displays of brookies from south-central Ontario have ever seen Shayne! Thanks for taking the time to post 'em.  Oh yeah, the Subaru rocks."
663505,atvaholic,2012-02-04 17:38:00,271,Here are a few from my adventures. Here we loaded up my truck with a zodiac and went wayyyyy down some logging roads. It was nice having a quiet motor to get us around the lake...  Here are a couple of decent ones..biggest is 2.5 lbs. 
663509,Ainsley,2012-02-04 18:02:00,142,"Sinker, great pics there! I'll have to post a few of my Algonquin pictures when I'm not on my phone. The one pic looks like you have a Subaru forester XT, I'm in the market for one at the moment actually, how have you liked yours?"
663529,Sinker,2012-02-04 19:31:00,8692,"The forester has been great. I put a new motor and turbo in it last winter, so its like a brand new car again. Great for back lakes, and awesome in the winter. WAaaaaaay better than the old jeep!! haha  Its for sale if your interested. I need something bigger!  S."
663727,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-02-05 13:41:00,1362,I'd definately give it a go....I have an ATV if needed...I love the back lakes    
663730,BillM,2012-02-05 14:04:00,17367,Ugh the Catskills.... Such an awesome looking place!
663733,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-02-05 14:12:00,1362, Impressive Bill....you have a good eye!
663738,BillM,2012-02-05 14:28:00,17367,Now I just need to get there
