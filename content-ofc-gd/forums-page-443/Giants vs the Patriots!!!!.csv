659847,biggs,2012-01-24 17:07:00,21," Couldn't agree more, the future is bright.  Suh also needs to relax a little but he is a MONSTER and hopefully Farley lives up to his potential."
659940,Big Cliff,2012-01-24 21:28:00,6899,"YOU'RE GOING DOWN.....LOL  You know my friend, you are at a real disadvantage here; If I was to pick NY, win or loose, I still beat you by one point. If you pick NE win or loose I still beat you by one point. Your only hope is that I stick with NE and NY does win. I do still have time to change my mind you know LOL."
659962,Billy Bob,2012-01-24 22:12:00,5865, But I took you for your word Cliff....As I know you're that kind of guy....

660603,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-26 15:25:00,336,"I too not a fan of ""The Great Gazoo"" either.  When Elly came into the league and was drafted by San Diego but refused to go there and forced a trade to the Giants.  Just left me with a bad aftertaste.   ""The Great Gazoo"", man thats gonna stick.   Not going to be a defensive matchup.   NE 43-27."
660606,Raf,2012-01-26 15:28:00,3495,Arrrrrrrrrrrgos
660643,Big Cliff,2012-01-26 16:29:00,6899," Oh the shame of it Billy Bob, to have an old Canuk who knows nothing about NFL keep ahead of you for the entire season. How you ever going to live this down? I think you should just go hang your head in shame my friend and perhaps pour yourself a couple of those Lancaster ice teas so you can drown your sorrows."
660656,Billy Bob,2012-01-26 17:03:00,5865,Cliff Ole' Boy....do you mean one of these...  Or better yet....One of THESE.... 
660657,BillM,2012-01-26 17:05:00,17367,There's a drink in that picture?  I didn't notice

663753,Big Cliff,2012-02-05 15:37:00,6899,"Get ready to watch a big ole redneck cry, Billy Bob sure is going to shed a few when NY looses this game LOL. Oh Billy Bob my friend, I sure am going to hold this one over you for a long time to come    :rofl2:"
663756,Billy Bob,2012-02-05 15:46:00,5865,"Got your seat belt buckled, because you're  going to need it...."
663771,corvette1,2012-02-05 18:13:00,1765,don't care who wins i have 31 squares on bowl pools show me some money
663780,davey buoy,2012-02-05 20:16:00,5505,"Change of heart as a friend dared me to take NY against HIS patriots.What the heck,a couple of bucks on the game will even make it more interesting."
663782,PatrickGG,2012-02-05 20:27:00,562,Pats 3 point win   :)
663787,danbouck,2012-02-05 20:34:00,4380,Both teams agree that they're winners and walk away. Bills are awarded the championship
663790,misfish,2012-02-05 20:46:00,29133,LOL Dan  Giants.24-13
659320,bucktail,2012-01-23 04:27:00,1857,Giants pull out he OT win over the 49ers. I doubled on the Giants and thinkI like them for the bowl. Put your picks down here.!!!!
659321,BillM,2012-01-23 04:31:00,17367,Thank the Giants defense and special teams.  Eli played like absolute garbage tonight.
659322,registerfly,2012-01-23 04:34:00,198,Lets get the hate on New England now!  GO GIANTS
659334,manitoubass2,2012-01-23 05:45:00,11391,New England all the way.  I'm saying 31-24 is the final...  Hopefully it's a game though.  The Giants and 49'ers game was a great game for sure
659340,davey buoy,2012-01-23 09:44:00,5505,"I'm with you on that one,New England for sure!"
659454,Nipfisher,2012-01-23 15:22:00,2449,HUGE GIANTS FAN.    Go G-Men.
659456,Billy Bob,2012-01-23 15:24:00,5865,WOW.....not 1 but 2 GREAT games yesterday......most Super Bowls do not live up to the hype....hopefully this one will be a nail biter....
659466,Grimace,2012-01-23 15:41:00,2020,I believe the NFC is superior.  Giants by a touchdown.
659477,scugpg,2012-01-23 15:56:00,1373,I really hope the Pats win this one. They will be looking to lay a beating on the Giants after the 2007 upset.
659482,misfish,2012-01-23 16:05:00,29133,"Pats are lucky they are there,COME ON."
659489,bushart,2012-01-23 16:35:00,2628,I agree Bri---dropped ball and missed FG  Pickin Giants
659490,manitoubass2,2012-01-23 16:38:00,11391," The same can be said about the Giants too, lol.  Brady will rebound after a bad game, and Manning will still be too sore to throw the ball, haha   "
659491,myot,2012-01-23 16:43:00,131,Cannot cheer for a team with a quarter back who looks like the Great Gazu from the flinstones with his bubble helmet  Go Pats not because I like them but because the alternative is just plain wrong  Dan
659498,bassman87,2012-01-23 16:55:00,586,"tom brady throws for 600 yds, rush for 200, and kicks 3 field goals. you heard it here first"
659515,uglyfish,2012-01-23 17:34:00,981,"I'm a big giants fan, the G men are gonna smash the patriots! All they have is a passing game, worst defense in the league, no running game. Giants will be all over them!  Giants for super bowl champs!! 31-10"
659536,davey buoy,2012-01-23 19:10:00,5505,"Brady admits,one of his worst games,the giants better look out,he's gonna giver"
659581,biggs,2012-01-23 21:06:00,21,"I think the Pats will win but want the Giants to take it!  I am a Lions fan, what do I know!"
659582,jedimaster,2012-01-23 21:10:00,3472,Rooting for the Giants but I am betting on the pats... I am gonna say a conservating Pats by 10 or more
659596,Big Cliff,2012-01-23 22:26:00,6899,"Pats 21-14 and I cream Billy Bob in the football pool. Oh wait, I'm already doing that"
659648,sleepjigging,2012-01-24 01:02:00,207,Lived in Boston for 10 years. Only need the Pats to be up by 1 point when time expires!  Jiggy
659730,Billy Bob,2012-01-24 11:14:00,5865, WAIT A NY MINUTE Old Timer...OK you take NE and I wanted NY....I am only 1 point from you and if NY wins you go down the Niagara River my old friend....LOL  GAME ON !  !  !
659735,Big Cliff,2012-01-24 11:54:00,6899,"That's a big IF there my friend and regardless, you've been eating my dust through the whole season I still feel pretty good about that!!!!!  Anyway, when NE wins you'll be 17 points behind me and IF NY was to get lucky and win you'll have only beaten this old Canuk by one game. That won't be much to brag about considering when this pool started I didn't even know who the teams were never mind any of the players or stats."
659737,Billy Bob,2012-01-24 12:07:00,5865," Not one game....but 17 points....just like a football game...it's the 4th quarter that matters most....and if you win by 1 point or 101 points it's still a win...""JUST WIN BABY""...who said that Cliff ? ? ?   YOU'RE GOING DOWN.....LOL  "
659762,Grimace,2012-01-24 13:45:00,2020, I am Lions fan too.   It was way better being a Lions fan this year.  We need a running game and we are set.  Stafford and Johnson are amazing.  Edit: Typo
659818,Big Cliff,2012-01-24 15:54:00,6899,YOU'RE GOING DOWN.....LOL  Regardless my friend this has been a blast and you have to admit that no matter what the outcome of the final game I have given you a real good run for your money!!!!!
