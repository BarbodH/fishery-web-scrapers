664152,NAW,2012-02-06 22:10:00,4022," No kidding.  We poked fun at that all weekend.  A true yurt is supposed to be portable.  It would take a week to break this thing down, and a flat bed truck to move it.  In no way, shape or form is this a traditional dwelling of a nomad..  But it was a comfy and warm place to stay.  I think the best part was sitting on the lake in pitch black dark with the yotes howling all around you.  Good thing I had bud the spud!"
664157,misfish,2012-02-06 22:31:00,29133," Just like sitting in the stand in the early  dark  at fall, and spring for turkeys. It,s an awesome sound,but keeps you on your toes.."
664160,capt bruce,2012-02-06 22:43:00,820,"If you told me winter camping 15 years ago , ARE YOU NUTS , but a few years ago me and a few brave friends went out with tents and  propane heaters snow machines and took on some great laker  and splake lakes around Elliot Lake for some ice fishing . First year we froze our buts off but we learned and next two years we did well. In the winter you have access to places you could never think of going with the swampy land and bugs of summer , Get out there if my wife liked it ,all will , as my wife hates bugs and wet feet ,I thought she hated cold too , but if you plan well and with the winter stuff you can buy these days .. NO BUGS < NO PEOPLE < NO SWAMPS < how can it not be fun .."
664177,NAW,2012-02-06 23:16:00,4022,"I've never been winter camping before.  But have been doing a little research lately.  I'd like to give it a try.  Maybe next winter.  From what I can tell, as long as your prepaired, it's not to bad."
663880,NAW,2012-02-06 01:46:00,4022,"I very good long time friend had a chance to rent a Yurt for a weekend during the off-season.  The original plan was to have 3 couples camp out the weekend in a Yurt.  But some last minute changes happened.  Only two of us could make it.  When I got to his place, I was (as always) warmly greeted by his two dogs.  they where very interested in the minnows.    We packed up a few last things, then headed over to the Yurt.  Check out these pictures.  What a cool way to spend the weekend!  Wood stove, drop down double bed, bunk beds (double on bottom, single on top) table set for 4, storage cabinets , sky light, 3-tiered patio with a bar and BBQ.  And to boot, it was less the 30' from the water!!  And it came with a sleigh for dragging our gear on to the ice    You can see the water through the trees..   The wood stove (which was way over sized for the Yurt.. It was 20Â° inside all weekend)   The sky-light. (which can open for more ventilation)    Drop down double bed.   Bunk beds   Toasty fire!   This little guy was very cool.  A fan that runs from the heat generated from the fire.  Made in Canada.  This thing ran all weekend, no batteries or nothing.  Very cool.   We made it out fishing, and managed two eater pickerel.  Crappy cell phone pics at night..  No flash    The next morning we tried a different area and ended up sitting on a school of perch for a few hours.  Biggest was 11.5"".  Took home 7 for lunch.    This will be my last full weekend long fishing trip for the year.  Just day trips from now on.  Camping in the yurt was awesome.  I would do it again in a heartbeat.  But next time I'm calling top bunk.  I woke up a few times at night to move around and WHALED my head on the support logs for the top bunk....  literally..  I've been bugging my buddy to join OFC..  Hopefully he does.  He's an avid outdoorsman, and could contribute a lot to this community.. I'll keep buggin him!"
663882,livinisfishin,2012-02-06 01:58:00,661,Looks like a pretty sweet setup!
663907,Rizzo,2012-02-06 03:24:00,4754,"Memo to self - start calling my shed a yurt and see if I can get someone to rent it...just kidding, looks like a decent set-up but in the first picture where you just see the outside its exactly what went through my head"
663908,kickingfrog,2012-02-06 03:29:00,8333,Very cool.
663910,limeyangler,2012-02-06 03:39:00,5204,Nice.  Hey...you dont happen to know where i could get one of those fans.

663956,Moosebunk,2012-02-06 06:23:00,3970,Glad to see ya had a good time fishing and no one got yurt.  Safety first.
663978,kickingfrog,2012-02-06 13:00:00,8333, Canadian Tire has carried them as well.
663980,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-06 13:06:00,2690,Very cool.  With a few fish as a bonus.
663988,gaspumper,2012-02-06 13:35:00,393,Home Hardware carries two sizes small ones $99.99 Large ones $149.00.They also carry replacement motors for $14.99.
664016,NAW,2012-02-06 14:47:00,4022,"$150 bucks eh..  I guess it's worth it, specially if you don't have power at your camp."
664023,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-02-06 15:17:00,0,"if you heat your home/camp with a woodstove, the ecofan does wonders for circulating the heat."
664039,Rod Caster,2012-02-06 16:05:00,5784,Right on Nick! But was it as comfortable as Blair's shack?
664048,NAW,2012-02-06 16:23:00,4022,"As comfortable..  Yes, way more comfortable..  BUT..  You can't ice fish at night in the Yurt.  And getting up to stoke the fire sucks  Specially when you smash your head on the bunk above"
664069,EC1,2012-02-06 17:54:00,930,Nice fish! Looks like you had an awesome weekend!
664089,Jon,2012-02-06 18:43:00,209,"I've yurted in Algonquin, MacGregor Point, Pinery and Silent Lake but this set up looks to be the best I've seen. Depending on the park, they offer either electric or wood heat but none have the fancy drop-down bed. Which park were you at?  Jon"
664094,bushart,2012-02-06 18:56:00,2628,"Yes--we have a question from the debonaire angling painter with his hand up....  AM I The only One Who Has Never Heard the Term ""YURT"" ?"
664103,NAW,2012-02-06 19:08:00,4022,"A yurt is a semi-perminant tent structure.  This one aint going no where.  Parks Canada have been putting them out at select campe sites around Ontario.  It's a good way to get people out in nature that don't like ""roughing"" it.. If you call camping at a national part ""roughing"" it.. I don't  This one is at Bruce Peninsula National Park.  They have 10 of them."
664108,bushart,2012-02-06 19:31:00,2628,Cool--Now I know
664120,misfish,2012-02-06 20:35:00,29133,Very cool Nick. TFS
664126,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-06 20:59:00,2582,  What  Lake is that Nick? Is it Cypress Lake? My folks used to have a cottage right across the Hwy from Cypress Lake but they sold it 7 years ago and I have not been back up that way since. Beautiful area. I have a lot of fond memories of time spent up on the Bruce.
664128,Terry,2012-02-06 21:05:00,14456,looks more like a Ger then a Yurt but must a someone in North America making them and calling it a Yurt
664143,capt bruce,2012-02-06 21:37:00,820,"The ger (the original Mongolian term), or the yurt (in Russian), is the traditional dwelling of the Mongols and, in general, that of nomadic people in Central Asia. So Terry guy ,they both the same .. But what you stayed in N.A.W.was nither , but for us poor Cunucks it is a close Fact-Simile and you had a good time whats in a name , weird shaped tent , etc. etc. no sheep skin involved tho , and a wood stove ??? ... My wife and another couple dog sleded (is sleded a word?) into Algonquin Park  from a place in Maynooth , stayed 10 days dogsleding , hourse rideing , skidoo rideing ,yurt sleeping , NO drop down beds tho , I know my wife wishes, was a great vacation went new years eve and stayed . Wish my health allowed it this year as we wanted but my body (and sorry my wifes too ) did not allow ..I will recommend winter camping to all,if its cold ,make the best, get out there ,NO BUGS , NO PEOPLE just the great outdoors , and the chances of seeing wild life is so much better than in the summer when the bush is so unforgiveing , allmost every night we sat around a roaring camp fire with the wolves howling at the moon talking about the deer and moose we saw that day , best time I have spent south of  Superior , and dog sleding is a BLAST , MUSH YOU DOGGIES >>>"
