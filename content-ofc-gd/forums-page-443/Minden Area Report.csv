We ended up with quite a few lakers, some small ones along with a few up to around 20"" long.  Marked alot of fish, but aside from a few suicidal ones, we really had to work for them.  Williams spoons, Swedish Pimples and hook/minnow combination took care oid business. Great day to be outside, that's for sure."

Buttermilk Falls Resort has their huts out on Boshkung, lots of huts on Gull(Miners Bay), and quite a few on Mountain.  As I said, sled travel was great, and my buddy had no trouble on his quad either.  I didn't travel the whole chain or anything, just commenting on the conditions as I saw them; exercise normal precautions."
