663156,wormdunker,2012-02-03 10:58:00,1711,Just bought an Ice 55.  Awesome features!  I've never used electronics on the ice but it's gonna get a work out this week end.  Let U know how I make out with it.  I was able to go online & download the user's manual before actually purchasing it.  This was a bonus in making a decision which one to buy.
