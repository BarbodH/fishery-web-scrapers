Was a beautiful day out, and not too crowded  (somethin about football and beer). Now for those who don't know me, I don't move too quickly, so for a good portion of the day, this was my view.  Steve and my son, Rob, off way ahead. As I said, a beautiful day. Pity the fish weren't more co-operative. The perch were picky, and the jumbos went into hiding. We only had a handful of quality fish.  We did run into a school of herring that were quickly released.  ROb likes his sink pictures gory  Would have been nice if the fish had co-operated, but the quality of the companionship more than makes up for it. Even stopped at BPS enroute home, so Rob could finally spend a year old gift card. They had a deal on some nice ice reels, $12.95 Now to hit the legs  with a good rubdown of liniment. Got to try and get some of the feeling back. Thats a drawback of a good outing. Start losing sensation in the legs."

663896,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-06 02:54:00,2582,Nice to see you lads Bruce...too bad the fish didn't come out and join us   Thats 2 weekends in a row for me. Perhaps I should find another hobby.  It was a beauty day though and like you mentioned pretty quiet out there.
