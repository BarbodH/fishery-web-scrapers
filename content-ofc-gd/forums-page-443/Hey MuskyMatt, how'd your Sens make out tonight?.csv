663675,BillM,2012-02-05 04:19:00,17367,"Crying himself to sleep, lol!"
663677,muskymatt,2012-02-05 04:33:00,2608,"Well, as much as I would have preferred a different outcome, I can say my Sens were outperformed by the Leafs tonight. I'm humbled, but not too disappointed seeing as this is a rebuilding year and the season series is now tied at 2-2.  My sens did suck tonight, badly, and deserved to lose. There...I admitted it  All that said, the sens still have a long way to go to suck as bad as the leafs...what is it anyways??? Like 46years....  Enjoy it while it's there boys...your leafs did good tonight!(but still suck)  "
