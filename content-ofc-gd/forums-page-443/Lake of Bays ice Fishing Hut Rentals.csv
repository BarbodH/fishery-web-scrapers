I havent fishin LOB for some Lakers or Whitefish at all so I am looking for some information on a hut operator to hook us up with a hut and some good advice for 3 or 4 days.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Bryan"

I don't even know if they're still in business etc.  Cheers!  edit: Looks like Hut to Hut is out of Minden, so not sure why I recorded that for Lake of Bays.  Maybe they have huts in a few places or are a guide service."

I haven't fished with him yet, but know a couple people that have and they only have good things to say about him.  Have been chatting back and forth with him for a bit, online, and he would be my go-to guy up there.  Click here to check out his web page"

663893,adempsey,2012-02-06 02:35:00,1498,"Just got back from a weekender up at Lake of Bays.   We went out of Dwight and South Portage Road into Whitehouse Bay.   We didn't walk too far out from Dwight, just past the few huts there into 50-60 FOW.  Ice was 8"" good clear ice and 3"" of frozen slush on top.    We walked about 1 km or so into Whitehouse Bay near Seagull Island (or Pancake Island? depends on the map you use) and the ice was 4"" of good clear ice with 1"" of frozen slush ice.  There were about 20 huts in Whitehouse Bay."
