664026,bigugli,2012-02-06 15:28:00,6138,I know a couple of guys who run to the west end of Erie for whities every spring.
664028,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 15:41:00,5865," Really, tell me more if you can......only whities I ever caught came out of Simcoe....and they were FANTASTIC smoked...."
664037,Spiel,2012-02-06 15:58:00,9065,"I understand that there's lots of Whities in Erie, just don't ask me where to or how to.  I did see this little discussion about it the other day, not sure what you can glean from it BB.  http://www.longpoint.on.ca/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=15932"
663444,bigugli,2012-02-04 04:44:00,6138,"I have caught many whitefish over the years, but sadly, the last time was some 28 years ago. I have also never fished for them through the ice. We used to catch loads of them along the wall above the dam, in the Soo. Long story made short, I was made an offfer I could not pass up until I got to the ""hill"". A slope of hard glazed ice that cleats would not dig into. I did a big backflip on the way to the ice. Took a couple of minutes to regain my bearings  The pic was taken after the ice had ""softened"". At least I wasn't the only acrobat Bite was soft and slow, missed a couple, but was rewarded with one nice specimen to make my day.  After that the well ran dry for me. Most folk, today, left the bay empty handed."
663445,irishfield,2012-02-04 04:56:00,26272,Nice Bruce!  The bp luge run! Next time just jump in the boggan and have at 'er!
663446,crappieperchhunter,2012-02-04 05:01:00,2582,Nice whitie Bruce!!! Sorry to hear about your spill.  It must have been a nasty one...I noticed in your fish picture you even had finger tips ripped right off your gloves  If nothing's broken and your still coming I promise the hill we will be walking done Sunday will be much tamer. Let me know.
663457,kickingfrog,2012-02-04 12:39:00,8333,"Nice, just like riding a bike eh? The rope can be used whilst going down as well as up. Glad you're ok."
663458,NAW,2012-02-04 12:49:00,4022,Now you can cook up some nice man sized fillets!  Perch are great..  But a nice slab of white fish meat!  I'm getting hungry just thinkin about it!
663459,Rizzo,2012-02-04 12:51:00,4754,only thing more slippery than that hill is the whitie itself
663461,limeyangler,2012-02-04 12:55:00,5204,Nice Bruce.....how deep were you fishing?
663469,asdve23rveavwa,2012-02-04 13:50:00,2690,"Congrats, 28 years is a long time.  I've been hearing quite a bit about that infamous hill latele.  Maybe just load up a toboggan and go for a ride"
663472,mercman,2012-02-04 14:04:00,7054,"Very nice Bruce. Never caught a whitefish. I dont even know if they have em around here Hope you didnt twist your back.That usually shows up the next day after a fall, and is really painful.  Paul"
663473,GBW,2012-02-04 14:10:00,8460,"BAAAHAHAHAHA  Good one! good on ya Bruce, it's been 38 years for me as I've never ever fished for them."
663474,Skipper D,2012-02-04 14:13:00,1970,"Nice to see people out injoying them selves and you look like you did just that , hope the bones are ok , thank you for sharing your fishing day ."
663476,bigugli,2012-02-04 14:17:00,6138,"There were 2 ropes. The long rope in the pic had a lineup of 20 sleds waiting to be guided down. The other rope  only went 2/3 the way down, then I was on my own. In the 5 minutes we were at the hill, 2 others had gone for a tumble  and one hut was smashed onto the rocks   Nice Bruce.....how deep were you fishing?  We were at 103'"
663523,Leecher,2012-02-04 19:22:00,7832,"Is that you Bruce    I'm shocked.... I don't recognize you in the pic   Joking    Nice whitie my friend... good job  P.S. Of course, again, you forgot to add the piece of resistance     I want to see that thing in a plate Thanks for sharing Jacques"
663528,Joey,2012-02-04 19:29:00,9122,Way to go Bruce
663545,bigugli,2012-02-04 20:07:00,6138," I'm saving that as a special dinner with my mother ( Mrs don't like fish).  The plan will be to do a baked whitefish with crabmeat and shrimp stuffing, served with a Skane mustard sauce or a Finnish dill sauce"
663546,misfish,2012-02-04 20:10:00,29133, That is how you do it Bruce.  Nice fish. Congrats

663563,Leecher,2012-02-04 21:15:00,7832, Good plan Bruce!!! Funny my Mrs don't like fish either    Sounds delish
663603,MJL,2012-02-05 00:32:00,2427,Congrats Bruce  I'm still waiting for my first whitie...Ever...
663684,young_one,2012-02-05 05:06:00,620,"Every time I explain that hill access to my non-fishing friend, they think ice fishing is an extreme sport. Who ever brought in the rope is the smartest and most thoughtful person, I wish him/her catch all the fish s/he desires! Also that skinny tree that's holding the rope, no other tree in their life have helped so many people.  Thanks for sharing, congrad on your first of many more to come!"
663713,Spiel,2012-02-05 13:03:00,9065,"Good job Bruce, that's some fine eating there!  I suggest though you don't wait another 28 years for your next one.  Oh yes, I too am familiar with the ""hill of death.""   LOL"
663774,corvette1,2012-02-05 18:19:00,1765,good job bruce
663798,MCTFisher9120,2012-02-05 21:09:00,3761,"Looked like a fun time out there. Get some YakTrax cleats for hills like that. Make it easy on yourself hehe  Thanks for Sharing,  MTBF"
663950,Moosebunk,2012-02-06 05:55:00,3970,Hey!!!!  Way to tackle the hill and a fish!  Good show
664020,Billy Bob,2012-02-06 14:56:00,5865,"That whitefish catch looks a little ""fishy"" to me....LOL....you better send me that fish for further inspection and testing...LOL  I would trade you 2 fish of your choice for any whitefish....I just LOVE to smoke and eat whitefish and they are NOT a species available here.... although they are suppose to be in Lake Erie....BTW has anyone ever targeted them and caught any in Erie..."
