664012,craigdritchie,2012-02-06 14:36:00,1586,"Now here's a fast boat - twin jet turbines, 150 mph. Just the sound of it warming up gives me goosebumps.  "
664015,Wolf 3,2012-02-06 14:38:00,134,That ride even managed to put a smile on Lungelarry's face!    
664041,Roy,2012-02-06 16:13:00,13728," Nice boat, Craig. I guess I can't convince you that my 60HP tinny was the camera boat for that clip eh?"
