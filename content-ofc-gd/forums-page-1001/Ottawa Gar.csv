224389,modny,2008-07-07 16:37:00,502,FREAKIN SWEET  what did u catch her on?

224401,fishing,2008-07-07 16:56:00,167,That is a fat one!!!
224428,tbayboy,2008-07-07 18:05:00,1497,"Nice fish.  We found them all over the place up in Georgian bay on Saturday but couldn't get them to do anything.  Damn things just lied there and you could pretty much reach over and pick them up.  Not nearly the size of that one though, what a brute (if a gar pick can  be called a brute  )"
224433,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-07 18:16:00,0,Very nice!! I've caught gars in Florida close to that size and they can really put up a fight and have really sharp teeth!Thanks for sharing!
224482,smbhunter,2008-07-07 19:59:00,186,"That is a huge gar! It may be close to the canadian record for both weight and length. You should try fly fishing for them, it's great fun, and a better fight then one conventional tackle. Great job!"
224548,fishindevil,2008-07-07 21:51:00,6254,"WOW....i have been fishin the ottawa for almost 20yrs ,and i have not caught one yet !!!! great fish man,awesome pic too...they are hard to catch,did you have to stalk them as thats usually the only way you can get one,to sneek up on him !!.i think the record for ontario is 12lbs,you should check that out,man its bigger than you think,they consider a 60inch fish almost a record.wow...please find that out  you may be suprised  congrats once again man awesome gar !!!!  you da man.."
