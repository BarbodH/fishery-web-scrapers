223846,limeyangler,2008-07-06 16:05:00,5204,Thanks for sharing that. I'm gonna have to try that...gonna go to CT and get a Glow Mepps. I am on a lake that seems to shut down for walleye as soon as it gets dark...its very muddy lake....but i always heard walleye fishing is good at night.....i'm wondering whether your tactic might prove fruitful...ty for the tip.
