224114,Green,2008-07-07 01:53:00,20,Went on our annual trip to northern Ontario in mid June. The fishing was very good for Walleye and Pike. The water level was much higher compared to previous years due to the longer winter we had. The bugs were quite bad when we went up but after a few days of not showering they seemed to leave us alone.  Most Walleyes were caught with a jig and plastic and the Pike were caught on long crankbaits/spinnerbaits and topwater.       View from our site   This is the average size we caught all week.        Until next year.  Gary

224625,Green,2008-07-08 00:01:00,20, I would approximate we caught a little over 200 Pike and Pickerel between 2 guys over the week. It was a new lake they opened up a couple years back and it held a lot of fish. We had access to 3 other lakes but the main lake was good enough. It was my first time up in this area of Ontario and we are hooked.
224631,Green,2008-07-08 00:07:00,20, Actually the colour of the grub didnt really matter. I bought a tub of Gulp's and wanted to use them up on this trip. We were on a lake off the Wekyakastik River near Moosebunks neighbourhood.
