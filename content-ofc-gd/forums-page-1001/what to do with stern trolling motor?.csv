223903,forrest,2008-07-06 20:17:00,1032,I have a 4stroke 40HP that trolls as slow as 3mph....Anyone think it is worthwhile keeping a hand controlled transom mount electric trolling motor if I have a bow mount foot controlled one?    forrest
223905,Dabluz,2008-07-06 20:20:00,701,No
223907,Billy Bob,2008-07-06 20:21:00,5865,It depends on what is more convenient to use. I like a bow mount foot control myself but others don't.  BTW that 4 stroker should be trolling down a LOT more than 3 mph. Are you sure you trolling gauge is accurate ? ? ?  I have a 50 hp 2 stroker that will troll down to 1.8 mph
223913,Sinker,2008-07-06 20:26:00,8692,I use my transom mount for the back lakes. It works great for that stuff.  Sinker
223916,forrest,2008-07-06 20:28:00,1032," 3MPH was a poor number.  I measured that with wind etc.  However, there will be times when I am going with wind and need to get only a little more speed (1mph?)....in that case I would have to use the bow motor for trolling.  Sinker: Do you use it for the peace and quiet or?  Whats wrong with the bow? forrest   what to do?"
223939,HTHM,2008-07-06 21:28:00,4082,"IMHO the bow mount should do what you want it to do. That being said, I was told my those more knowledgeable than me that one uses a bow mount for positioning during a drift. I, on the other hand, do troll with my bow mount. There is something about QUIETLY going through the water that is so relaxing..."
223958,Sinker,2008-07-06 22:37:00,8692,"I use the transom mount, because I can put it on any boat. Usually in the back lakes, there are ""stashed"" boats that you can use.......I just take the transom mount and a battery with me. These lakes I couldn't bring in my fishing boat with the bowmount.....too big.  Sinker"
224090,forrest,2008-07-07 01:36:00,1032,"thats right!.....I forgot all about that!  There have been times where that motor would beat the heck out of the oars.  so......on my main boat it sounds like a resounding ""no""  thanks guys.  forrest"
224293,Victor,2008-07-07 13:22:00,1609,have you considered using a drift sock?
