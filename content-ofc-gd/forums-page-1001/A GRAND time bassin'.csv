224330,Jaymerica,2008-07-07 14:56:00,12,Hey guy's I was in the Bass derby last weekend and we observed some really strange activity on the river too. We were fishing below Glenn Morris when we heard something moving in the bush it sounded like someone spooked a moose and it charged through the trees! Knowing there are no moose in the area we were curious as to what it could be then it started again we looked towards the shore and could see trees shaking it looked like something was trying to climb one of the trees figuring it must be a black bear. We asked another couple in a canoe if they saw it they said they saw something brown/tan on the shore run into the bush but it was too low to the ground to be a dear. It didn't seem to run far but appeared to take cover in a tree the tree was shaking pretty good so it must of had some weight to it. Could it have been a cougar? Whatever it was it scared the crap out of us and the other people in the area.

224452,BITEME,2008-07-07 18:53:00,1969,stay out of the evidence locker before you go fishing
224460,largemouth,2008-07-07 19:04:00,112,"I have felt and witnessed similar in the past, when i went to see what it was I found a CO with a set of binoculars and a radio spying on me, he was calling his partner who was making his way to the other side of the river incase i decided to run...."
222375,fishing n autograph,2008-07-03 01:17:00,2540,"So, I decided to nix the ponds and head to the river. I had heard of a few spots on the river that were pretty good so off I went for a couple hours instead of dinner at my in laws....  anyway I hit the water and after about 10 casts i hook a really good smallie and it jumped a few times before spitting the hook. I couldn't understand how i didn't have a good hook set when i had hammered him a couple of times just to drive the hook home....anyway...that was 0/1  A few casts later and i catch this average guy.....put up a pretty good fight though!      But the strange part was.......i felt like I was being WATCHED. I'm NOT a paranoid person, but I felt like everywhere I went on the river today there was someone or something inside the tree line behind me. I grew up in the bush and I know when things are moving in the bush and I could have sworn there was something there. I know it wasn't the wind.....it really gave me the creeps and i'm still uncomfortable when I think about it. It takes a lot to creep me out.  Anyway, I packed up and left and hit two of my favourite ponds but the wind and rain had kicked up so top water was out of the question......"
222379,PatrickGG,2008-07-03 01:21:00,562,"Interesting that you felt eyes on you i fished the grand alot alone and i felt that way the odd time till one day i noticed a small herd of deer in the thick laying low and watching my move, thanks for sharing the report and i wanted to ask you how was the water clarity on the grand? just curious i was out there on the weekend and it was all washed out."
222380,Greencoachdog,2008-07-03 01:21:00,8163,Paranoia strikes deep yanno!!!   PEPPERSPRAY!!!  Great report and pic!
222381,fishing n autograph,2008-07-03 01:23:00,2540,  I was waist deep and i could see bottom pretty well. A little stained but overall good clarity
222389,Musky or Specks,2008-07-03 01:30:00,2710,Lots of deer. I mean tons of them up and down the river. Also the odd pack of wild dogs.
222397,Stoty,2008-07-03 01:44:00,2910,Its those darned Ninja's again!
222401,fishing n autograph,2008-07-03 01:46:00,2540,I'm pretty sure it wasn't deer....i've been in the bush and around deer a long time...didn't feel that way. It felt completely different....very different

222441,fishing n autograph,2008-07-03 03:02:00,2540,"nope, i try to stay close to home.....  always looking for bass holes in the KW area....if anyone knows of 'em let me know lol...."
222459,bigfish1965,2008-07-03 03:42:00,3382,Sorry dude..that was me. Was just trying to get some smallie tactics from ya.
222478,jediangler,2008-07-03 04:21:00,1923,I used to hear voices in the gorge along the Grand river near Elora. Turned out it was just a bunch of drunken campers in the conservation area.
222490,ehg,2008-07-03 05:03:00,2666,At least you caught a bass there. Kinda urban fishing.   Maybe you were being watched by some druggie teens who thought you were an undercover cop pretending to fish but were afraid you were going to steal their dope?
222503,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-03 10:46:00,0,"If it had you that spooked, why didn't you check it out??lol Are you sure you have nothing on your mind?Why would anyone be following you? Just get out there and enjoy your fishing. And cut down on the stimulants!lol"
222570,pikehunter,2008-07-03 12:50:00,1659,"Aliens, that's what it was, Aliens!  Or maybe all the pressure from being a cop has got you, time to take a fishing trip."
222615,fishing n autograph,2008-07-03 14:02:00,2540,"  haha...no pressure....and i'm not sure why i didn't take a look....was in the middle of the river anyway, would have been a long walk. Where I was the river was maybe 60-75 yards wide. Not too urban, kinda on the outskirts of the city"
222625,Tarzan's Jane,2008-07-03 14:11:00,1183,"Ahhh carp...gonna be longer now before I set out by myself...I think it may have been a bear, a big black hungry bear...."
222709,Jer,2008-07-03 17:18:00,1426,...well now someone from here is gonna follow you around just to freak you out...
222720,Bly,2008-07-03 17:43:00,1556," No way, a fellow OFNer would never do that!"
222764,Mattitude,2008-07-03 19:07:00,155,Just be thankful you didn't hear dueling banjoes while you felt like you where being watched!
222840,addict,2008-07-03 21:47:00,475,you sure do got a purdy mouth.
222843,danbo,2008-07-03 21:55:00,2646,Probably Munchkins..    Or an Alien..    Or my ex Mother-in-law..    or..  
222844,HTHM,2008-07-03 21:59:00,4082,"Ya know, if you were a Mountie you could handled what ever it was, what do they teach you Alymer anyway??"
