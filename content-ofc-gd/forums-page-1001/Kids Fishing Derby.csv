224414,Tarzan's Jane,2008-07-07 17:21:00,1183,Great report Cliff...congrats to Sydney!!!  She and her new little friend will be telling tales soon...
224418,steve_paul,2008-07-07 17:29:00,658,"Congrats Sydney  Awesome report Cliff, great job by you and Carole getting her out there and enjoying fishing.  Not too much beats a great day fishing with your kids."
224437,fishnsled,2008-07-07 18:23:00,3520," I didn't think there would be a report so I wasn't too concerned.  I'm concerned now!    Your welcome on the kind words, nothing but the truth my friend."
224534,wuchikubo,2008-07-07 21:32:00,1114,"Cliff, Carole, and Sidney,  I'm glad you all had a fun time out there. It was really good to see Sidney getting the biggest perch award. We'll have to do it again sometime  Hopefully, without me having to deal with baiting 4+ kids lines all day.  Don't know about your trout, my mine tasted oh so good with only a little sea salt rubbed on butterflied trout and broiled at 450 F for 20mins. Fresh fish is hard to beat!  Stan"
223960,ccmtcanada,2008-07-06 22:48:00,7971,"Way back in the early spring, Hearingfish (Stan) invited my daughter to compete in a kids fishing derby.  Well, today was finally the day.  It was held at a fishing club with private ponds stocked with perch, sunfish and rainbow trout.  The tournament had 3 main prizes....one for biggest perch, biggest sunfish and most fish for a family.  Anyhow, we met up with Stan in the parking lot around 9am, and proceeded to the registration.  After paying the fees, they directed our little one out to an area where they had gifts for all the kids who participated.  By about 945, we found our spot on the pond and literally, within seconds, she has her first fish of the day landed.  A tiny perch.  Here I am helping her remove the hook.   She continued to land perch after perch, with the odd sunfish mixed in.  All these fish counted torwards the results.  A fair sized one was put in to be measured and we kept on going.  She worked hard for all her fish too....she was out there for 2 hours straight...trying different locations around the dock.   Bly was out there throwing spinners trying to entice a stocked rainbow to hit, and it wasn't long before she caught a nice one that is now getting ready to be our dinner.   Bly and I took turns trying for rainbows while the other helped unhook our little ones fish.  Finally...just before we were to break for lunch, I got a feisty trout!   Our daughter had a great time and met up with a new friend....Hearingfish's daughter.  They were inseparable all day long.     Hearingfish, not to be oudone, lands a trout after the tourny was over.   Then, for the exciting part of the day.  We found out that Sydney had won the biggest perch prize for the day!  She was sooooo excited...she's always wanted a trophy and now she has one.  Check out her prize....a 7 foot flyrod with reel, fishing vest (woo hoo...since it's too big I suppose I'll use it....LOL), a tackle box filled with tackle and of course, what she really wanted....a trophy!!     Thank so much Stan...we all had a GREAT day out there today.  It was great seeing you again and a real pleasure to meet your family and spend the day out there with you all."

223974,danbouck,2008-07-06 23:38:00,4380,
223978,jediangler,2008-07-06 23:45:00,1923,Great report. That pic with the trophy is classic. The fact that she won by working hard for her fish will not be lost on her. Nice looking trout on the grown-ups too.
223982,danc,2008-07-06 23:54:00,4677,That is fantastic. A chip off the old block for sure!!
223995,jimvanm,2008-07-07 00:15:00,27,That trophy is a beauty. I have to admit I am jealous!  What a great way to introduce kids to the sport of fishing.
224000,Big Cliff,2008-07-07 00:21:00,6899,"Way to go Sydney  Loved those pictures!  Hope to see you guys soon, I need a Sydney hug!"
224004,ccmtcanada,2008-07-07 00:25:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  She hasn't stopped smiling and kisses that trophy when she sees it.  She just came downstairs and she wants to keep it in her bed for tonight...LOL.  Terry - leave my ice fishing alone.  That first fish was huge...that's the way I remember it and that's the way I tell the story....  Bri - She already outfishes me....now she has the trophy to rub it in my face....hehe.  Glen - Yep...you said it....she cant stop smiling about the day.  She told me just before she found out she won that she's had the bestest bestest day ever.  And I've accepted the fact that I suck at fishing....LOL.  Jedi - I agree...we stressed that hard work won't always mean that you win, but if don't work hard you probably wont win.  I think she's starting to understand that now.  She knows that we were proud of her...even before we found out the final result."
224148,Mattones,2008-07-07 02:20:00,587,Awesome report! Cute kid. I'm sure most of the prize stuff you will be using. lol

224218,jace,2008-07-07 05:32:00,472,"Great storytelling.   reads like a play by play.   I used to use orange and yellow bobbers like those when i was young.   Oh, to be back in those simpler days again...my biggest decision was deciding if i was going to use it yellow  or orange side up.     So we'll be seeing that vest in the next pictures?  lol"
224231,Roy,2008-07-07 10:28:00,13728,Great stuff Cliff and Carole. All I can say is that you are bringing up a good citizen there. Congrats to that Sydney Sweetie.
224265,Victor,2008-07-07 12:24:00,1609,"WTG and congrats to Sydney! This will definitely add on to her fishing addiction !  however, I do feel bad for the other kids who attended that tourney ... I'm sure they knew it's over when Syndey puts her line into the water...  at least there are many other tourneys the other kids can go to haha!!!"
224311,duber,2008-07-07 14:20:00,220,Congratulations to all and that sure is a cool trophy Sydney!   .Way to go!
224319,Joey,2008-07-07 14:36:00,9122,What a great report Cliff.  Congrats to Sydney for me.  I can see by the smile on her face she had a really great day.  Joey
224324,limeyangler,2008-07-07 14:45:00,5204,"WTG Sydney!! great report Cliff, as usual."
224407,fishnsled,2008-07-07 17:08:00,3520,"Sydney - you ROCK!!!  Congrats on your prize winning catch, you have a couple of the best fishing trainers/coaches in the GTA.  Their expertise is obviously rubbing off on you.  Don't worry Cliff, I won't tell anyone that you got out fished on Saturday as well.   Ooops.....now where is the delete button."
224411,ccmtcanada,2008-07-07 17:12:00,7971, Will....I still have to write that report from Saturday...I can make you look like a fishing god or jerk....hmmm....  Thanks for the kind words.  Sydney is still talking about it and showing her trophy to anyone she sees walking by...LOL.
