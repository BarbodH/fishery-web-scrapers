It was well worth it, I took a Big Pig over 11lbs on a 20 Jet tonight. It looks like it's going to be an  awesome season for my clients in the upcoming weeks ...20 Jets back 175 with double gold willows were hot today as well as Big Dipsy's back 105 on a 2 setting with Spin & Glows took some nice fish tonight went 5 for 8 in 65 fow off the Island SE of Port Maitland ...
