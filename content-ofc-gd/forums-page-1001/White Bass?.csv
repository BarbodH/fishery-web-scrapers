222238,fishermccann,2008-07-02 20:48:00,655,"I was fishing the mouth of the Rouge River on the weekend , and for the first time , I caught a White Bass . Anybody else ever heard of such a fish being caught in that location.   P.S. Before anyone asks it was on worms!"
222250,wuchikubo,2008-07-02 21:50:00,1114,I have heard of white/silver bass being caught at the tributary mouths around TO but have not tried to catch one yet. I believe the Urban fishing guide also mentions them being able to be caught in waters around GTA.
222300,ehg,2008-07-02 23:46:00,2666,"Many years ago i would catch white bass at L. Ontario creek mouths at this time of year. Caught perch, sunfish, rock bass as well at this time. The white bass liked real small spinners with bit of worm on it. Cheers, ehg"
222725,fishermccann,2008-07-03 17:50:00,655,The one I caught was only about 1/2 lb.  Do they school? Can they be caught in numbers?
222914,mike hagan,2008-07-04 01:04:00,50,"Yes white bass are caught in this parts of lake ontario as well as the other bays that line east of that,but Rare and hard to catch ."
222995,rhare,2008-07-04 10:54:00,387,"     Yes they do school, if you found one you should find more. Try small spinners as suggested."
224344,fishermccann,2008-07-07 15:13:00,655,How big can they get? Any limits on them as I saw nothing in the regs.
224361,ehg,2008-07-07 15:56:00,2666,There is no limit or closed season on white bass in Ontario. They aren't caught often enough or really that widespread. They can get to few lbs. but mostly they are 7- 10 inches around creekmouths of the Great lakes. Here is one my fishing buddy caught. They don't get much bigger.  ehg

224530,markiemark70,2008-07-07 21:22:00,158,"I was at Bronte on Sunday and 2 young guys came up to me with a fish they caught asking if I knew what it was. I was stumped at the time, but the best I could come up with was White Bass. Now I know!"
224589,mikethespike,2008-07-07 23:24:00,51,"caught & released a lot of them last year @ high park,  biggest one is about half a pound.  from what i've observed they're most active around 2nd to last week of august and are often caught with 3-way bottom rigs with worms.  i heard they're good eats too."
224741,gone_fishin,2008-07-08 04:09:00,481,"they are definitely a schooling fish... at least they are when they're in lakes... not sure about rivers... they are tasty too, i kept a few that i caught out on west lake a couple weeks ago... still got some in the freezer, might cook 'em up tomorrow night during the forecasted t-storms!"
