223554,Steelcat,2008-07-05 12:44:00,191,"I went to Rice Lake for a couple days of fishing from July 3rd to 4th.  Fishing was tough on the 3rd caught only 6 bass and countless rockbass for dinner.  On the 4th, the weather was wonderful, light breeze.  We managed to catch 30+ bass, including a 20 inches smallmouth.  True, 20 inches smallmouth can be the highlight of the trip... But here's the REAL highlight of the trip~~~~ While we were drifting on a weedbed, we saw a large osprey dived into the water............Yep, not just flew close to the water and grab fish with its feet, but actually crashed landed onto the water.... Then we saw it had a hard time getting out of the water... Eventually it did, but to our surprise it caught a fish.  Even after it went up into the air, it had a hard time flying...  I took this photo immediately after,  and when I resize the photo into 100%, this is what I saw...  Can you see the size of the bass it just caught?~!  I want that bass~!!!!!!!!"
223558,danbo,2008-07-05 13:07:00,2646,Osprey! Nice bass!!
223563,modny,2008-07-05 13:31:00,502,i'm just gonna hook an osprey to my fishing line and let it do the work for me  thats a HUGE FISH
223565,jwl,2008-07-05 13:36:00,1056,"I saw the same thing this past week at my trailer, but the Osprey was too far away to get a good pic..the bird was cathcing bigger bass than us"
223589,setomonkey,2008-07-05 15:26:00,872,Very cool photo! I've seen ospreys take sunfish (or maybe it was a small bass) but not a fish as big as that...  Mike
223749,Mattones,2008-07-06 04:48:00,587,holy macro thats a big fish! That would be amazing to see.
223796,Carp,2008-07-06 13:25:00,1488,"Sweet pic !  I've heard of bald eagles snatching 10 lb. pike out of the water, but have never seen any bird of prey do this myself."
223835,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-06 15:47:00,0,WOW! That is really cool!!!! I didn't know they could target fish of that size!Was the fish suspended or shallow?  Oh and that was a really nice smallie!Did you fish the east or west side of Rice Lake?
223836,limeyangler,2008-07-06 15:51:00,5204,Awesome pics! i saw an eagle grab a what looked like a 20lb Laker once...awesome spectacle. BTW....whats the recipe you have there...that looks delicious!!!!
223919,Steelcat,2008-07-06 20:33:00,191,"I fished close to west side of Rice. As for the yummy looking fish, we actually prepared our fish in two ways.  One is pan fried with bacon fat, and the one I posted was steamed with sea salt."
223924,ehg,2008-07-06 20:44:00,2666,"That is a real good size smallie you caught.  The bass which the osprey caught looks about the same size.lol  Read before that Osprey weigh about 4 to 4.5 lbs and generally catch fish  25% their weight. Occasionally they try for fish near their own weight (like that one). That's a rare sight. Great photos and report! Thanks, ehg"
224300,Victor,2008-07-07 13:40:00,1609,Congrats on the PB! .. o wait I mean... to the osprey.  That a very very cool sight and amazing picture to share with us! Thanks for the report.   o yeah... nice smallie you got too lol!
