223447,fishboy,2008-07-05 00:32:00,550,"Had a nice long weekend on the opener fishing in the Haliburtons.  The smallies were on in shallower water (still cool with surface temps 70-72F) on the rock shoals, rock to weed transitions and points and seemed to enjoy senko clones (watermelon/pearl laminate was working well) and tubes (salt & pepper and smoke).  Attached is one of my better fish of the weekend and also my youngest daughter's first smallie.  After being out for panfish, she was dipping the worm left on her hook into the water off the edge of the dock (all of 4 feet) next to one of the boats.  She almost got taken for a swim when the bass decided to have a snack.  "

224459,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-07 19:03:00,0,Sounds like the Haliburtons have a healthy population of smallies. Gotta check it out one of these days. When the gas comes down!!! Thanks for sharing.
