Taking advantage of the babysitting we went to magnetawan and camped on ahmic lake this weekend.  My awesome wife!    Me having a beer friday evening thinking about all the fish i'm going to try to catch in the morning    We had a great time and she did come out on the boat with me for a couple hours over the weekend!  She was quite happy to sit in a chair and let me go fishing!  So i was out at 5 am saturday morning.  It was chilly but well worth getting up early.  First fish was a scrappy 2 pounder.    Ended up catching a few of these over the couple days i was fishing.    Lots of these smaller scrappy guys          Sunsetting saturday night!    Early Sunday i was out on the water for 445am.  What a great morning!  It was sooooo peaceful  Sun rising    Video of the sun rising.  I sat for about 10 minutes watching it come up.  It was a relaxing experience and a great way to start the morning.    Got into about 15 of these little guys this morning in about 2 hours.  Wasn't any size to any of these guys but they sure were fun to catch.    Overall it was a great couple days with my wife.  We had a great time at night, playing games, drinking beer with the other campers and I had a blast fishing ahmic lake.  Best guess would be about 40 fish between saturday and this morning.  Nothing big like i'm used to on ahmic but all really fun to catch!  I didn't even make the run to the east side of the lake for walleye which was my main goal this weekend.  Relaxing tonight at the inlaws and going to hit nipissing in the morning!  Cheers!"
