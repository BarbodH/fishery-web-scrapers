222855,Slayingm,2008-07-03 22:17:00,204,"I had a Guided Fishing Adventure todo on the weekend with 11 Electricial and Leasing contractors from the city. Apparently a number of them have  cottages in the Haliburton and Muskoka area so they decided to limo a number of the boys up to the Haliburton's to meet me for a day a fishing.  I was a little disapointed that they wanted to go out on the chain lakes (Head, Grass, Kashagawigamog, Canning and Soyers as I have only ice fished there before and never had my bassboat out on that water yet.  I poured over my contour maps of the lakes, put a strategy together and headed out early to meet the boys.  Everyone decided that Walleye was the target species for the day as a few of them wanted a fish fry on the long weekend. The boys rented a 22ft deck boat, 18' bowrider and I took 2-3 guys in my Stratos at a time and we switched up over the day.  I headed to some classic looking structure and started fishing a variety of crankbaits and plastic grubs on rock points/drops and off deep weedlines.  The weather was perfect with low winds and overcast conditions.  Within minutes at the 1st spot we nailed a 4.5lb Walleye on one of the new perch coloured Storm crankbaits.... minutes later I tagged a couple of nice fish on a 3"" plastic grub on a 1/4oz jig head and the day was off to a great start!  Over the course of the day we caught and released a number of good Walleye's and a great time was had by all... in fact 2 of the guys caught their personl best Walleye on the trip( (5.5 and 4lb).  One of the hot lure's for the day was the new 'Clack'n Rap' from Rapala which will be out in 2009... I have a number of them that I am trying for them and the Fire Tiger model worked well for some nice fish like this one.....   I kept moving to some new area's and found some productive spots over the course of the day.... 3 different spots produced the most fish and by the end of the day we had a number of nice Walleyes swimming in my live wells and the boys were some happy.  Here is a group pic at the end of the day....   Take care and Good Fish'n..... Greg."
