223293,keram,2008-07-04 19:38:00,585,"First time this year my youngest daughter Maggie has joyned me on the water. Considering beautifull weather, and this special ocasion, I was pumped for this trip  Morning sun   Concentration   Comfort   First catch 5"" perch   Second catch 8 "" sunfish ( big jump in size )    I was hoping that next will be 12"" bass, but instead she has decided to aim higher We were drifting slowly over weedbed. The weeds were very thick, so I've put weedless spoon on her line ( silver minnow) After few minutes she hit a ""snag"".  , but ""snag"" is pulling the line I helped her land this ""snag""  To top it up she has wanted a nice picture of her catch  , so here it is    After adrenaline rush has ended, we've decided to enjoy this beautifull boating weather   On the end we even left few ""doughnuts"" on the water  It is history already, but I think I'm still on ""cloud nine"""
