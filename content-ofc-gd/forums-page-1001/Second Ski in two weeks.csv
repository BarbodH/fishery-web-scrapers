224018,Badger Shark,2008-07-07 00:44:00,291,"After last weekend when I caught a nice muskie which broke my net, I decided that Eric and I would head back to Constance bay and try our luck again. We met up with Steve (Troutnmuskiehunter) and the 3 Amigos who were already out for several hours by the time we got out. They had a couple of strikes but no hookups.  It was a beautiful day, sunny, hot and not much wind. We tried for muskie for an hour or so and then decided to switch things up and trolled smaller cranks. We got a few pike and a couple of bass but nothing of any size.  We were just about to quit the Bay and head over to Buchams when my rod doubles over, I grabbed it and told Eric "" This is a good fish "" all the while hoping it was a muskie, I didnt want to jinx myself saying I thought it was a muskie. It was a great fight and peeled alot of line. Once it got closer to the boat Eric was ready with "" The replacement net "" for the one that was broken last week by a nice muskie. She finally gave up and Eric scooped her up and now I have a new PB muskie and a nice pic this time so here it is.  "

224263,Badger Shark,2008-07-07 12:22:00,291,"Jediangler, not sure the length or weight, I wanted to get her back into the water as quick as possible.  It was a fairly long fight on a walleye trolling rod with 10lb test P-line so she was a bit tired.  we figured she was in the low 40's""."
