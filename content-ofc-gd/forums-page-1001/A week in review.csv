Got out Friday evening again and got a 4.585 lbr .. Sat morning I was hoping to get another high 4 pound fish to put me in contention for the big prize .. didnt get anything big but my son Dawson managed to get a 2 ponder which was his biggest for the tourney    after a fish fry at my friends place we went to the hunters and anglers club at 3 for the annual awards .. ends up my bass was big enough to win me 2nd place for big bass .. first time I ever won anything at the torney .. it was only 75 bucks but it covered the beverages for the week (well almost) ... hopefully next year more will enter the tourney as the numbers were down from last year"
