224178,Gerritt,2008-07-07 03:00:00,6129,"Johnny Bass.... you and I need to talk  I grew up on that lake in the summers up until I was 16... I think we would have a blast out there... Nice Slab!!...  you are correct about the soap factory, unfortunatly... I can remember years of suds washing up on shore... they were HEAVILY fined...  Get in touch via PM and lets set something up, I would not mind seeing what has happened to my grandparents property... (Directly across from the factory)  And I know of a fella that is just itching to get out fishing!... Boat, Gas and a goodtime are on me!  G"

When i take a newbie out I usually set them up with a bobbler and a piece of worm on the hook. There's always loads of panfish to keep them busy & happy lol. The problem is that, you won't be able to fish much because you'll be too busy unhooking fish/hooking worms."

223817,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-06 14:45:00,0," Thanks guys!  Hey Brian. Ya I was a little disappointed this time. I caught fish but no quality fish, but that Crappie was a lot bigger than it looks!!  As far as eating fish from that lake?Not with that soap factory on the lake. So its pure catch and release."
