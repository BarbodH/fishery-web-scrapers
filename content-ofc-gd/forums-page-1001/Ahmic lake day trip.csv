Arrived at the lake and my son says he's going to cast from shore while i get the fishing gear ready. First cast with a buzzbait and a nice size smallie slams it, he landed it and i got a picture for him.    We spent the day on the lake, catching many smallies and a few pike from the area. had some trouble with the camera as i left it on the seat of the boat in the sun which made the camera very tempermental. Would have liked to get a picture of the walleye that my son caught with a zara about five feet from shore, I guess it was feeding time as the sun was setting and getting dark. Got a few more pictures added below. It was a great day to spend on the water with my son.      We'll be heading back to Ahmic a few more times this summer.  Berge"
