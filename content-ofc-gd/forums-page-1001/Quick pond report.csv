It was a late start this time as I arrive at 3pm to see the pond is all mine. Fished for 2hrs with little 1/16oz jig & grub combos that the bluegills loved tearing the tails off. I bet I went through a dozen grubs on twenty bluegill.  Most of the gills were this size, also caught a hand sized sunfish that put up a great fight. I did get a shot at a decent largemouth (15-17"") but he tailwalked towards me after I set the hook and spit the jig away. No problem, I know where he lives  Everthing was released to swim free for another day."
