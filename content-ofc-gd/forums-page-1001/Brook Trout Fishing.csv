While the water was still 51 degrees, the weather stabilized for a few days and it seems timing is everything with these elusive fish. This trip, the fish were active and we released a half dozen and lost several others.  They averaged between 19"" to 22"". One was a real 'football'  shape with a girth over 14. Alan    "
