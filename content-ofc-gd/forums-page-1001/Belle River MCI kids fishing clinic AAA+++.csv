223894,Handlebarz,2008-07-06 20:00:00,3790,Well it was that time of year again and I must say what a great day we had the weather man knows what weekends count and gave the best weather to the right group on the right day the KIDS with all the bad weather weekends it was great to see the temps stay nice and the sun out if full force.  Any way on to the report I dont know final numbers yet but last count I heard there was 100 kids and 44 parents (that is only the ones that registered the kids most had both mom and dad with them) so we ended  up wit h150-200 people in total it was a blast and a great weather day (incase I forgot to mention it)  I got there around 7:50am and found that alot of the stuff was already set up but there was alot more to do so on to getting things ready.  here is Cody who is our local MUSKY master youth if you need to know just ask him he has alot more big fish then all other members. Cody was nice enough to set up a display of all different fishing stuff from Musky to harnesses and dipsy for rainbow he knows his stuff.   The girls getting some kids registered for the day.   The prize table where we had enough for everyone it shure is nice to have such a great bunch of sponsors that help us out and the rest is paid for by our membership and monies raised from our Can-Am and other events we do.   The local Lake Shore Summer camp this is supposed to be a great camp for kids.    Transport Canada comes out and talks about boating safety with all the kids    Chris laroch is a local teacher at St Anns high school who runs the fish hatchery program came out to shre what he does at the school      A channel news came out to interview our guests and also our Chairman    The MNR once again was here to talk about the importance of taking care of our resources THANK YOU GUYS  FOR THIS these kids are our future.      The OPP were her talking with the kids and passing out alot of good info for the kids and families along with finger printing stuff so you can have a record of your child on hand just in case.    This year we even had a T.V. star on hand Wayne Izumi was able to come over and visit us and shure some laughs with everyone he was only here for a hour or so and took time to sign autographs for everyone THANK YOU WAYNE it was very nice to have met him he is a very nice guy.         It was nice to have the huge trees in the Belle river park to hide under and get out of the sun and have some food and drinks.    If it was to hot for the kiddies then they just head over 30 steps away and hit the splash pad.     Last but not least the prize table again where every kids got a prize we had enough for everyone and then some we also had 6 draws for bigger prizes that were donated by local business after we drew the names for there first prize all the names went back in for the big draws for fishing rods computer stuff Charles Weiss Muskies Canada 30th Anniversary shirts and one other thing I can not think of.          I would just like to thank all the people that make this event happen each year with out the support from our Loyal members of the Belle River Chapter of Muskies Canada and our local business this event would not be able to have grown into what it is each year.  One other BIG THANK YOU TO BIG AL His wife had to answer the call this morning and get him out of bed after we called to tell him our order we had was to small and change it to some monster of a order with Pizza and wings for everyone Thank you again to everyone big and small it was a blast to have been a part of this again this year.  Oh yeah one more thing it was nice to be able to drive into Belle river and see our club logo on the BIA board it shure is great to see how much this Chapter is making our mark in a good way to the South West part of Ontario.

224474,Handlebarz,2008-07-07 19:33:00,3790,thanks all I am just reporting it there was alot of work that goes on rigth from yesterday until next year we have already started planing then next one before I joined the club a few years ago I had no idea how much work goes into these events I always feel bad for not having time to sit back and just talk to people when these functions are going on you have to be on the move and before you know it its over then kiddies are happy and were drained.  I hope everyone can go out and take there kids to a function around your own area these are going on allthe time across Ontario so just get out and have some fun.  If you are in the Belle river area the weekend of July 20th stop in we will be back again helping out with the kids fishing derby it is a very fun time and FREE you just have to make the time for you kids thats it.   Oh yeah I think we will be having a float in the sun splashparade again this year. that is July 19th in Belle river
