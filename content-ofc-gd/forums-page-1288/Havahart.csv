21998,Clampet,2007-01-13 17:40:00,1947,"Just wonderin if any of the members know where I can purchase/rent the live release traps. I have a growing population of stray cats in my back yard. I feel bad for them, but they seem to be growing in numbers, and are keeping the local rabbits at bay. I called the Mississauga Humane society, but the gal who handles those queries is away till next week. I thought maybe someone on the board might have something I could borrow or buy at a reasonable cost. "

22105,Bly,2007-01-13 23:51:00,1556,Not sure if they have to exact trap you are looking for but you can usually borrow one from the local animal control (think there was a 50 deposit).  Good Luck!  blyght
22109,Carp,2007-01-13 23:59:00,1488,I've seen them at Rona in the garden section. They're around the baits for mice and rats.
22167,verno,2007-01-14 04:23:00,178,If the trap is going to be visible just check with local by law animal control places first.  Some places you cant trap animals yourself.  If its gonna be in the garage where no one is going to see it or hear the animal whining it may be worth trying yourself.
