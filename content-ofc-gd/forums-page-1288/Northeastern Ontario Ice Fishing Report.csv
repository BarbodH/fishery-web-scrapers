22140,lovetofish,2007-01-14 01:14:00,500,Nice northern and report!  That ice sure looks tempting...   lovetofish
22142,fishindevil,2007-01-14 01:24:00,6254,"well im glad i came back to see your pics,thats a nice speck for sure    i bet you were wondering when that pike hit if it was a huge speck,wouldnt that have been nice   good catch bud and im glad at least there is a few guys out on the hardwater,but they are like yourself and way up north,we are still waiting down here in southern ontario for good ice with are temps finnaly droping we might get to fish very shortly...maybe 3-4 days from now...we hope are fingers are crossed"
22157,Carp,2007-01-14 03:52:00,1488,Brookies are great anytime. A few through the ice sure beats sitting at home.  Thanks for the report and pics.
22577,kennyman,2007-01-15 05:12:00,737,That pike looks big to me! Nice one!   Been a while since I've even caught a fish. I wish it would either freeze over here (southern Ontariariario) and give us some ice or go away and bring on the nice weather. This inbetween stuff is good for nothing! Can you tell.I'm jealous?
22691,duber,2007-01-15 15:40:00,220,Nice fish.Makes me want to go for a drive!!!!!!!!!
