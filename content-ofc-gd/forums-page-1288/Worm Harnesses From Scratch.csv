Ive rigged some nice floating harnesses but there wasnt a whole lot of science put into it, basically i just copied some existing harnesses i had. Theres got to be some way to put some more thought into the process to come up with something different on the water. My Oneida trip isnt too far off and Id like to be proactive and be ready to show the fish something new and exciting lol. On Oneida, we mainly slow troll 3 way rigs with long leaders and bottom bouncers with floating harnesses. I dunno, just thought it would be an interesting topic even though its a bit out of season. Ive loooked in cabelas for blades, floats, beads etc.......any other good suppliers out there for making up these homemade rigs?"
