22198,Gerritt,2007-01-14 12:32:00,6129,A COMPLEX LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM FROM THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING A SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL TO THE REGIONS TONIGHT INTO MONDAY. AN EXCEPTION WILL BE AREAS NEAR LAKE ERIE WHERE ICE PELLETS AND FREEZING RAIN WILL BE LIKELY TODAY. IN FACT FREEZING RAIN HAS ALREADY BEGUN IN WINDSOR AND WILL SPREAD ALONG THE NORTH SHORE OF LAKE ERIE EARLY THIS MORNING. THE FREEZING RAIN IS EXPECTED TO LAST SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE CHANGING TO SNOW AND ICE PELLETS. FREEZING RAIN IS ALSO POSSIBLE AGAIN TONIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING. TRAVELLERS SHOULD EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION AS UNTREATED SURFACES MAY BECOME QUITE SLIPPERY. SNOW WILL BEGIN THIS EVENING OVER THE SOUTHWEST FROM SARNIA TO LONDON TO HAMILTON AND AS FAR NORTH AS KITCHENER AND MISSISSAUGA. NEAR 10 CENTIMETRES OF SNOW IS EXPECTED TONIGHT WITH ANOTHER 5 CENTIMETRES MONDAY. SNOW MAY BE MIXED WITH ICE PELLETS AT TIMES. THIS MEANS A TOTAL ACCUMULATION OF UP TO 15 CENTIMETRES FOR THESE WARNED REGIONS. THE TIMING OF THE SNOW COULD ALSO POSE A PROBLEM FOR MONDAY MORNING COMMUTERS. GIVEN THE TIMING OF THE EVENT AND THE FACT THAT THIS WILL BE THE FIRST MAJOR SNOWFALL FOR SOME OF THE WARNED COMMUNITIES..THIS COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT WINTER EVENT. THE WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR REGIONS ALONG THE NORTH SHORE OF LAKE ONTARIO AND THE ST LAWRENCE RIVER. WARNINGS MAY BE EXTENDED TO THESE AREAS AS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRACK OF THIS STORM SYSTEM BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE COLDEST AIRMASS SO FAR THIS SEASON WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM. ENVIRONMENT CANADA WILL MONITOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SITUATION CLOSELY. PLEASE REFER TO THE LATEST PUBLIC FORECASTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS.  There are a host of warnings issued for various regions...   Gerritt.   PS.. sorry for the caps... this was a copy and paste from the weather network.

22204,charlied,2007-01-14 13:06:00,584,yes it does suck cause we have to tear down a gymnastics competition and load it into trucks...that should interesting with ice....LOL
22242,xrap,2007-01-14 15:33:00,683,I hope there's no school
22272,hawkeye,2007-01-14 16:50:00,162,Why does it seem that we get these things on a Sunday. Just makes the Monday morning slog to the workhouse all that more enjoyable.  Only a dusting here in Keswick right now BUT it looks to a good 2 weeks of below freezing temps. Maybe that will ice over Cooks
22273,silveradosheriff,2007-01-14 16:54:00,1025,"Here it comes, put on your blades!"
22277,RickOnt,2007-01-14 17:05:00,669,Here in Gilford  -3 C and light Snow!!
22279,motv8tr,2007-01-14 17:13:00,2587,"The Weather Network says it's -5 up here, but it feels warmer to me, just cloudy now, but they say we'll get some snow here tonight, not too much though...  Supposed to be a chilly night though, good for making ice  Maureen"
22291,Carp,2007-01-14 17:39:00,1488,"The deck has been covered with snow for a couple of hours and it's not going to stop soon. Speaking for my neck of the non-woods. (Mississauga)  Can't complain.  If all the rain we've had was snow, we probably would have broken snowfall records for Nov. & Dec. Quite a bit of rain the first half of Jan. too."
22330,Tdel,2007-01-14 19:41:00,393,"Warming up Maureen, now up to -3C and still looks like spring.   Certainly is different seeing Toronto getting the white stuff instead of us.  Hope the Weather channel is right about the light amount of snow we are suppose to get tonight.  Of course you won't hear any complaints from me if we don't get anything at all.  Tom"
22342,dsn,2007-01-14 20:13:00,1018,"I thought we wantted hardwater season, no?"
