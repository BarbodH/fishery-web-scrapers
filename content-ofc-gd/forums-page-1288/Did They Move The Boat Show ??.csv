Is this a totally different building or just a different name for the Trade Centre ??"

22402,pikehunter,2007-01-14 21:59:00,1659,"Nice memory Lew, Iron Workers contributed so much to our society.  Yep, I agree, the organizers must just love to see more cars added to the already too heavy rush hour traffic.  They probably have their reason for the open hours though, busiest times etc. I guess. Be better to go mid morning then leave before the rush hour starts if at all posible."
