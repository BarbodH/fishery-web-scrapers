22389,SlowPoke,2007-01-14 21:38:00,2984,"My Jeep sprung a leak (transmission line) so I had to drop my wife off at work. While I was out I picked up a few essentials... 4 Deep Diving X-Raps. When I got home I realized that I've run out of room in the crankbait department so I thought I'd pick up a few more Plano 3700's when I go to pick her up.  I grabbed three Plano 3700's and then stumbled across this...   I thought to myself ""Self, I bet these three Plano boxes will fit in there""   They fit nicely with a few friends... 15 in total. I wonder if I could put more in...   I can! That's 18 3700 boxes... but wait, what if I want some 3600's?   Cool! I can store 15 3700's and 5 3600's All for $22.00 at Walmart -Brian"

22465,Hooked,2007-01-15 00:20:00,891,"A term popped in my head when I saw your tacklebox....Tackle checkout girl.  hahah.  Wow, nice collection there.  And I thought my 6 3750's were alot.  All I can say is you've inspired me to increase my collection.  My wife will love that."
22539,ChrisK,2007-01-15 03:20:00,2772,"OMG,Thats an awsome idea !!! Tomorrow I go to Walmart  Thanx for sharing...."
22568,Carp,2007-01-15 04:38:00,1488,A sweet idea slowpoke.  That's quite a large tackle box though.
22583,SlowPoke,2007-01-15 10:16:00,2984,Thanks everybody for the positive feedback. I was looking for a semi-portable center for my tackle. I don't plan on leaving the house too often with it.  When I go fishing I travel with this: http://tinyurl.com/yzxnes  And I plan on picking up one of these for traveling light: http://tinyurl.com/yfqp89  Now I have to find something better than cardboard box for my muskie stuff.  -Brian
