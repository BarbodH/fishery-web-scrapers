21869,nautifish,2007-01-13 03:46:00,1416,"Well headed out early this morning. Our plan was to head down to Lake st claire and do some fishing down that way just for a change of scenery. Anyway on our way down we stopped at walley mart and grabbed a couple of new lures. Left there and decided to hit a well known bait and tackle store. Man i could have spent half the day in there. I swear he had everything and both the guys working there were great. Well anyway i finally after three different locations found my bug chug.....lol....I also brought myself a brandnew LED allure lure. Has anyone else tryed these out? They are pretty dern cool. No batteries the light has a thousand hrs of life, And they really do look cool in the water.  So anyway after about an hr in there we were told about a real hotspot for pike & they were not kiddin. So we headed on down and on the way got a blooming flat tire. So got that fixed had a sarnie and headed down to the water. Now this was my 1st time down here new terain and it was absolutley beautiful. There were allready about five people down there fishing. Ohhh and as we left the van we saw three guys going back to there cars with what looking like a couple of pike in a plastic bag.....So anyway we get down there and find this.   What a total mess. So untangled it all and ended up with all these....    I had a couple of hits with in the space of like 20 minutes and missed both....Grrrrrr...There were some people a little ways down from us that were pulling in one perch after the other.   I think you can just make them out on the rocks.   Anyway we decided to move further down river when we saw a guy pull in this little beauty.    Which sadley was also taken home....But the hook was buried pretty deep and it was bleeding. The guy who caught this pike was actually going to grab it by the inside of its mouth. I about had kittens and hollared at him NOOO!!! He looked at me like i was crazy.....lol  So anyway on our merry way......Steve decided to try the new bug chug i had brought and sure enough he got a hit on it. Was a nice pike too just a shame he never landed it. *smirks*  We were in this erea for about five hrs today and i saw seven pike in total pulled out of this body of water. Four of which i saw taken away in bags.  For a friday it was pretty busy down there so i am thinking that there is probably allready alot of presure on the fishing here which is why i am not revealing the location.Its a shame that that many pike were taken and thats only what i saw with my own eyes in those few hrs Could have been more.  But in all even though i never landed a pike today i got to see some beautiful new scenery it was a nice mild day and for sure beats working. So Today was just a awesome day to be out by the water.  This is a very short video clip of the pike that steve never managed to land and then me just blah blah blahing!!!!  <a href=""http://www.zippyvideos.com/1960803706520736/pike_hot_spot/""><img src=""http://i2.zvhost.com/2/j/jb42128f.jpg"" border=""0"" /></a>   Oh!!! And one last thing. Was also out fishing late last night. I was bored so i decided to head down to the lake and seen that they have finally taken the fishing tugs here in dover out of the water.       Okay tryed to add the video link like six different times now sorry cannot get it to work for some reason. Shame !!!"

21889,Mike the Pike,2007-01-13 04:42:00,3421,"Thanks Nautifish for your great and detailed report nice pics and video.I won't be going out Saturday because a couple of cold nights have given us some ice.I will have to wait 2 weeks my BOQ partener Kenny has invited me and my 2 little ones, Ryan 8 and Robin(girl) 10 for some speckled trout fishing on the ice up in northern Quebec.We called yesterday there is ice but not safe.My oldest Daughter 12 said she doesn't want to go I am dissapointed  .Oh well!keep the reports coming Mike  ice  ice  ice  Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
21891,fishindevil,2007-01-13 04:47:00,6254,"well tracy,you tried very hard,and thanks for the great report & pics/video at least you caught some used lures,to bad there wasnt a big pike on one of those.  ..lol...lol better luck next time  cheers"
22005,JEREMY,2007-01-13 18:08:00,300,I think that is the place i was telling Rich about.If so youshould be there on opening day it is crazy some nice bass come out of there aswell my mother in law cayght a four pound smallie there last year on her first fishing trip.Was there a dam to the right of you?
22358,nautifish,2007-01-14 20:42:00,1416,  I can just imagine Jeremy. Was talking to a couple of local guys down there said they pulled in a 4.2lb smallie last yr.  Like i allready said it was a friday and quite a few people down there. I thought it may be quieter being that is was a working day for most.....WRONG!!!....
22372,Markus,2007-01-14 21:05:00,25,"Good effort Tracy.  Ya fell pretty short of LSC, but ya found some fishable water.  That's a decent spot, but it see's a ton of daily pressure.  You have some better pike spots closer to home.  Glad to see you're still getting out.  We have some crappy weather coming at us now, so we'll see what that does to us for options.  Hopefully it opens more up."
22400,nautifish,2007-01-14 21:57:00,1416,  Yeah i know Markus i was down at one of our local spot this morning 1st thing.  Took the boat down but it was just raining so hard decided to fish from shore for little over an hr instead. No hits today but ohh well!!! I was sodden to the skin with a waterproof jacket on...well felt like it anyway.........I think i would have rather it had snowed than this  cold wet misserable stuff.....lol  Will see how the weather fairs up this week. If the water does stay open will head down again one day through the week......As for getting out  the only thing that would stop me would be a hurricane.
22410,Rich,2007-01-14 22:14:00,3927,"Bring on the ice, then the real pike fishing begins!"
22429,nautifish,2007-01-14 23:08:00,1416,  lol well will have to wait and see rich.....A grlfreind of mine just gave me a call said there is a little dusting of snow on the ground  where she is in brantford and when she was on her way back home to around 3.00pm this avo she said the roads were all fine till she hit waterford. Said the roads from there were like a icerink.  Its not doing anything here and i see no ice out front on the roads. & of course it had to stop blooing raining didn't it...grrrrrr!!
