22264,RickOnt,2007-01-14 16:36:00,669,I am getting bored!!!  What with no ice or snow.  So I am playing on the puter(with very limited skills) trying to get a pic I have in photobucket up as an avatar.  I found the Controls and Avatar settings. I tried to copy and paste but no luck. Not sure if I copied the correct file or pasted to correct spot.  Do I paste to Image from computer and the browse???   Any Help??   Thanx
