22659,Cast-Away,2007-01-15 14:48:00,790,"The oil companies are pretty cute now. The price only drops in the evening now, so if you want cheaper gas, you can't even get it on the way home from work any more."
22663,lew,2007-01-15 14:56:00,12767,OPEC is considering cutting back on production to drive the prices back up.  Guess they can't survive on their current paltry profits
