22411,danc,2007-01-14 22:27:00,4677,"As fishermen/women, I'm sure we've all used Ziploc bags many times. Not only for food storage, but to keep countless things dry while out camping, fishing, or just in the boat. But have you seen these things? Huge, huge Ziplocs are now on the market. I bought a pack of 3 (about $9.00) of the biggest ones. They are made of very heavy plastic and should be able to be used many times over with a little care. I'm impressed with them. Can you imagine how many Walleye fillets that you'd be able to fit into one of these??    Ziploc"
22414,nautifish,2007-01-14 22:34:00,1416,DANC  You ever see those bags u can use for storeing linnen. You suck the air out of them with a vacum hose.  I beleive they come in twice the size of that bag. Now whether they are any good for freezing food in i have no idea....lol
22415,mason05,2007-01-14 22:34:00,258,Thanks for sharing Dan.  I might just have to pic a few up for me and the lads prior to our annual Algonquin trip.  They will surely out perform the good old garbage bag.  Where'd you pick them up?  Corn Nug
22419,danc,2007-01-14 22:40:00,4677,"I've got some of those too Nauti, but mine leaked air back into them after a while. I think that these Ziplocs are way cool, although I haven't field tested them yet.   I'm an old garbage bag user too Corn Nug. They were great in their day. I picked up the Ziplocs at Zellers."
22436,irishfield,2007-01-14 23:39:00,26272,Dual purpose for canoing! Once you get there...empty...fill with air and use as a pillow.
22442,Carp,2007-01-14 23:50:00,1488,I can probably use those to do some cleaning. Great to keep the fluids off the carpeting in the vehicle. Won't be able to reuse them thou.  How many arms and legs would they hold ?
22447,dsn,2007-01-14 23:57:00,1018,Hey Dan where did you buy your from?   dsn
22449,danc,2007-01-15 00:00:00,4677,  My what?? The Ziplocs came from Zellers.
22461,fishindevil,2007-01-15 00:18:00,6254,"hey dan thats exactly what i was thinkin when i saw them....   how many walleye fillets could i put in there,  i always carry maps and all kinds of stuff like that so they will be much better than garbage bags for sure   thanks for showing those im gonna get som tommorow"
22484,Bernie,2007-01-15 01:00:00,3190,Neat bags Dan. Be excellent for camping....btw..Are you a NASCAR fan? I seen your hat.
22502,Terry,2007-01-15 01:48:00,14456,had a buddy that always walked around with a ziplock full of pot...  I am sure one that size would have put a smile on his face
22508,holdfast,2007-01-15 02:00:00,1813,WOW you can fit a whole map in it.  Water proof and readable
22540,pikehunter,2007-01-15 03:20:00,1659,"....just one of those bags would do for an entire bucket brigade! Sorry, I couldn't help myself."
22556,danc,2007-01-15 04:01:00,4677,  Oh yes. I got this hat last fall at the Kansas race. These hats were issued to the security guards and were not available for sale. Making friends with the security guards pays dividends. I actually saw one on E Bay that went for $50.00. Can't wait for Feb. 18th!!
