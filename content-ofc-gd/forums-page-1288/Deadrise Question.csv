22322,krawler,2007-01-14 19:19:00,167,I think i understand the concept of deadrise but im looking at 2 fishing boats at the show andthey have different deadrise numbers.  one has a 8 degree deadrise and the other has a 12 degree.  From what i understand the 12 degree will run slower but be more stable and the 8 degree will be faster and less stable ... right????  is this a big difference between the two??  anyone know of any boating forums i can ask these questions.  this is a fishing forum and i have a ton of boating related questions and i dont think i should be asking these questions here.  thanks  kris
22327,irishfield,2007-01-14 19:31:00,26272,Boating and fishing go hand in hand...ask away...I'm sure there will be many willing to help.  How was the show?? Worth the trip/admission. Boating accessories fisherman would want? etc?

Nothing wrong with asking here, but if you are looking for a boating forum this one seems like the one....http://forums.iboats.com/"

If you ever trolled with a beam sea in a true deep V, over 20deg deadrise, it will damn near toss you out of the boat when it gets rocking.  THe difference in stabillity from 8 to 12 with the same width and freeboard won't be much but the 12 should be a little more comfortable ride in choppy water with a small loss of top speed and fuel milage."
