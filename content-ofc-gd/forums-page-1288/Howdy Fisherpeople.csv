22590,brickNblock,2007-01-15 11:25:00,598,"Nice Intro Dave. It'll be a pleasure to check out your posts....... I'm not in the ranks of danC(brookie) and Scotty(steelie) fishing.....even after 30 some odd years of fishing the streamsNrivers, but it is still my first love of angling.  Theres just something fantastic about these acrobatic, tuff, headshaking stream fish thats uncomparable.....their shear size in just inches of water at times.......awesome. .......looking forward to your reports Dave."
22633,dustink,2007-01-15 14:04:00,526,Welcome to the OFC!  I'm guessing you'll do just fine around here.  dk
22767,dave kaeon,2007-01-15 18:25:00,13,"humble thanks once again!     such a friendly bunch of folks here and that's refreshing especially on the internet... hehe  i'm just here to rediscover a lot of forgotten angling gems. y'know.. those little sparkling moments you're able to briefly grasp the elusive reasons why you're on the water to begin with. and when you find some good reason, just hang on for as long as you can because you'll never know when something that was never yours to begin with, will simply drift away.    i tend to ramble in person too so this intro is pretty true to form... take care all."
22374,dave kaeon,2007-01-14 21:11:00,13,"hey mjl, ya 2 or 3 years ago i lived right 5 minutes from the humber. i mainly fished it from springmelt til the dropbacks were all gone... usually a couple hours each morning to get me through the day. i never really fished the bridge hole or above the multinumbered dams... basically only the courts' runs and below bloor in the frogwater undercut bank. i'm sure we've shared a drift or two.  i had browning gray neos but they were just too much fun to put on and wear so i had to get rid of them!  why, whudda ya know? i just happen to have a pic from above the dirty subwayline! and just so nobody starts climbing my back about how shallow the water is and my flyfishin it... the slot where i caught that hen and 3 others was approx. 15 ft wide and averaged 4-6 ft deep... pretty sweet run for downtown toronto fishing i have to say. the shallows i'm standing on actually is normally a small 'island'. just so you guys know.       nautifish, i heard that some types of hare and rabbit actually require more nutrients from the one eating it to digest, than what one may actually gain nutritionally from it. weird, but i heard and read about it from some 'survivalist' folks... still might make a neat snack on he water though!

22395,danc,2007-01-14 21:48:00,4677,"Welcome Dave. I like your resume already. I'm a Trout guy and small game hunter too, but from the Northwest of the province. We'll get along just fine I'm sure."

22487,Carp,2007-01-15 01:14:00,1488,"Welcome to our OFC family Dave.  Dave Kaeon ? (Dave Keon) Nice handle dude.  I used to fish that stretch of river when I was in my teens. I remember riding the subway before I started driving,  with my rod, waders, other gear and a couple of garbage bags doubled up with a ripe chinny hen inside. You can imagine the looks I got from people on the subway.  Smelled so strong in a heated subway car."
22497,TJQ,2007-01-15 01:44:00,7806,Welcome aboard dave.. nice stuff.. GREAT pics
22515,ChrisK,2007-01-15 02:11:00,2772,"Dave, Glad ya liked that smoker idea...Heres another thought...Sometimes when I'm feeling a little lazy and don't want to go outside to smoke my meat I just simply do up a batch,add liquid smoke and run it throught the dehydrator....I make venison,moose, salmon and rainbow jerky and every other fish speicies you want to put in and it turns out delicious...Great food for when your walkin down the river..Just load up a pocket full in a zip lock and you never half to stop for lunch anywhere just keep fishin... So you don't have to limit yourself to a smoker and the dehydrator is only about 40 bucks last time I checked. http://www.popeilfamilystore.com/dehydrato...CFQOYWAod4UMtJg"
