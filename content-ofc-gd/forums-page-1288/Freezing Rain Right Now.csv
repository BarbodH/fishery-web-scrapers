22667,nautifish,2007-01-15 15:10:00,1416,Well joey i hope you are going to turn ur butt right back around and head back for home......Hey i know!!  Let's go fishing......lol
22679,Garyv,2007-01-15 15:24:00,547," Although I have driven 4 X 4's for years I agree and it also makes me chuckle, but then again the new 4X4 owner that tries the system out on dry pavement and tries to make a turn also makes me smirk."
22733,irishfield,2007-01-15 17:16:00,26272, You won't have to worry who's reading over your shoulder!!! LOL  Just snow up here..3 or 4 inches. Thought we were getting lucky as the ground was bare a midnight.
22584,lew,2007-01-15 10:19:00,12767,"We haven't got any snow yet from this ""weather system"" but were getting losta freezing rain right now in the east end of Toronto and everything is getting coated, so it'll be a miserable drive for anyone on the roads this morning.  Be careful this morning folks when you take that 1st step outside"
22585,SlowPoke,2007-01-15 10:33:00,2984,"Same stuff west of the city too... especially bad near Guelph. It gets slightly better towards London. I hate getting wheel spin when I'm grossing 88,000 lbs. This would be a good day to stay at home... unless you need to go fishing. -Brian"
22586,motv8tr,2007-01-15 10:36:00,2587,"Yikes, glad I'm not going to work today...I hate ice, I'll take loads of snow any day instead.  Up here it's started to snow, pretty good to, sent three dark colored dogs out, and three white ones came back  .  We're only supposed to get 5-10cm in the course of the whole day though, so it'll ease up I'm sure.  Be safe if you have to drive today, remember to give those in front of you lots of room.  Maureen"
22587,brickNblock,2007-01-15 10:56:00,598,"Thanks for the inside track on the cons out your way folks. I went into semi-retirement last October and just this past week was asked to give a guy I know a hand completing the brick/stone on his house starting today.......out in Markham.  Will not be making the drive at all........Not a chance.  It starts to look a little better come wednesday according to the WN on the 'puter. For those who do drive today........have your wits about you please...it's not just your driving but the idiots near you who forget how to drive these cons, That, I find, the biggest problem."
22588,Whopper,2007-01-15 11:18:00,2174,Been raining here since last Thursday night. Not cold enough here to do anything else. It's 57F right now and tomorrows high is supposed around 29F that will make it interesting.  Be safe out there.  Whopper
22589,dsn,2007-01-15 11:22:00,1018,Yeah its a msaaive system going by!! 
22593,silveradosheriff,2007-01-15 11:44:00,1025,Not fun out there this morning.  Be careful all!
22594,xrap,2007-01-15 11:50:00,683,There goes my snowday
22596,camillj,2007-01-15 11:54:00,1988,G'Mornin Lew  Yeas I was just out shovelling the walk  ... I actually enjoyed it ... guess its been too long since our last snow ... it was very slippery in Etobicoke ... please get the salt out guys and lets not have any broken ankles before the first shot at lakers and whities (I think we might just get what we've been asking for )  And be extra careful on the roads ... I know a small army of salters was getting ready last night but I can tell you the side streets are definitely a sheet of ice right now
22598,pigeonfisher,2007-01-15 11:59:00,696,"I made it to work safely.  Wasn't to bad, seems as though they got the salters out early!"
22601,xrap,2007-01-15 12:06:00,683,"WOW, ICEDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Back to bed"
22605,Blake,2007-01-15 12:32:00,418,Is bad out this morning lot's of ice on the vehicles
22606,Harrison,2007-01-15 12:39:00,2202,2.5 hrs from Clarington to East York.
22608,motv8tr,2007-01-15 13:03:00,2587,"Glad you made it in safely Harrison, I've been watching the news and it seems lots of people aren't.  Maureen"
22609,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-15 13:19:00,2585,was suppose to have a meeting south of hamilton today.  im not going anywhere!  Going to work from home and enjoy some extra time with my son!  Cheers!
22610,Harrison,2007-01-15 13:21:00,2202,"Sweet of ya Maureen, thanks.  The only dolt I had to avoid was a 4x4 as he spun out on the 401."
22611,bigbuck,2007-01-15 13:29:00,2449,"An hour and 10 minutes from North Oakville to Yorkdale Mall. Not too bad but it's slippery out there. I'll second the motion on tossing out a lot of salt on the roads and sidewalks/driveways. I'm gonna stop to pick some up on the way home today, the snowblower is ready to go but I'm not sure if I'll be needing it."
22612,Mike the Pike,2007-01-15 13:32:00,3421,Its snowing here in Montreal we are expecting 10 to 15cms.Finally my kids will have some snow to play in .minus 14 tonight bring on the ice.Mike
22614,hawkeye,2007-01-15 13:33:00,162,"40 minute commute turned out to be about an hour. Keswick to Richmond Hill. Stayed off the 404 but it didn't look to bad. Snow in Keswick, freezing rain in Richmond Hill. I'm not looking forward to the trip home"
22616,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-15 13:34:00,1351,took me a nice 10 mins to scrape all the ice off the car with the heater on max.. have fun for you guys out there!
22620,lew,2007-01-15 13:41:00,12767," I hate to admit it, but I often get a chuckle when I see the 4 X 4's in the ditch and the ""dolt"" standing in a snowdrift, scratching his head wonderin what just happened  Some of these 4 X 4 guys figure their invincible and have no need to slow down like everyone else when the road conditions  go down the drain."
22621,troutologist,2007-01-15 13:51:00,951,I was surprised to find the university closed after I walked there and doors were locked. That revelation made today a lure making day by default.
22626,urbanangler1990,2007-01-15 13:57:00,933," ur sooo lucky    i heard Hamilton got a power outage and all, whats goin on over there? Well im off to skool"
22655,Raf,2007-01-15 14:39:00,3495,It's not so bad??  Not sure what all the hoopla is about?  I'm not that old and this was par for the course when I was a kid.  It's winter in Canada afterall.  This is minor.
22657,Joey,2007-01-15 14:44:00,9122,"It's not too bad, but it did take me 3/4 of an hour to get the 4.9 kms it is to my work, and now there's nobody here!!!  Joey"
