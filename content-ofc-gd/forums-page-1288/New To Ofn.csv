22564,kennyman,2007-01-15 04:29:00,737,Welcome to the board muskiesRus. You won't mind if I bug you for advice about gator wrestling will you? Seems we have alot of muskie nuts here. Some seasoned and some wannabe's like myself who'd love to learn. Any info would be greatly appreciated. The more in depth the better.
22578,muskiesRus,2007-01-15 05:29:00,18,"That's a pretty tall order,Kennyman! I wouldn't know where to even start. My best advice would be that if you are anywhere near a chapter of MCI consider joining or just go to one of their meetings and see for yourself how friendly and helpful these guys can be.If you have any specific questions I would be more than glad to be of help if I can!!!! Check out the MCI website for a possible chapter near you. www.muskiescanada.ca"
