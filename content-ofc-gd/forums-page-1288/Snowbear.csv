22505,Bernie,2007-01-15 01:53:00,3190,Some of you may have seen these before but this was the coolest thing I have seen in a while.   The tracks Hydraulically drop when you park it at the fishing hole. Floats too.
22513,Dondorfish,2007-01-15 02:09:00,1000,That is sharp  - any idea on the cost and what they weigh?   Don
22517,Bernie,2007-01-15 02:15:00,3190,Two real good questions and I'm not sure of either one of them.    I just posted it for interests sake. I will find out tomorrow if you like. It moves along very well and steers easily. A small 4 cylinder gas engine and a heater. rides pretty good too. I wonder if I can talk my brother into a test drive on Nipissing?
22520,ChrisK,2007-01-15 02:17:00,2772,Do they float ?? 
22521,Bernie,2007-01-15 02:23:00,3190,Ya Muskie..they do..Maybe I should have tried it today.
22528,Carp,2007-01-15 02:37:00,1488,WOW !!!  That thing looks awesome.  Beds too. I could get used to riding and fishing in that thing. The ultimate portable ice hut.
22535,Fisherman,2007-01-15 03:05:00,7201,"Don't quote me, but I think I saw a $20K sticker mentioned somewhere last year, don't know if it was Cdn or US.  Considering it more or less covers ice hut and transportation, if a guy was to buy one and keep it for 20 years then the price wouldn't be too bad."
22543,camillj,2007-01-15 03:39:00,1988,Wow .. looks too cool ... but .. just ot play devils advocate ... because we all wanna toss $20K into our next hut  ... by my figuring it would be about a three foot haul from ice level into the vehicle ... need a real long gaff  :) :0
