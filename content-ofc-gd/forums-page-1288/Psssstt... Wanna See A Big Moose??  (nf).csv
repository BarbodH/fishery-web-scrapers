22404,danc,2007-01-14 22:06:00,4677,Just how close would you get to this guy for a good photo? I have no info on these photos. I got them in an e mail and thought that I share them with you guys. Incredible.    
22406,irishfield,2007-01-14 22:10:00,26272,LOL...they're not wasting any time getting back to their van! Don't think I'd turn my back on him....  What a beast Dan!
22407,Bernie,2007-01-14 22:11:00,3190,Nice looking bull. Healthy one too. My son and another fellow had 5 bulls go by them all at one time in deer season. Wonder where they were in moose season?
22409,nautifish,2007-01-14 22:13:00,1416,"Holy crap that thing is humongous   I would have had kitten right they're & then OMG!...LOL  A few yrs back my uncle who used to be a scout leader took a couple of teen boy's includeing one of my boy's up on a canoeing and camping trip up in Argonquin park.   They were up there for a week, Anyway when i saw the pictures my son and another lad chris were in the water in the canoe and were really close to this moose. My uncle took pictures......Actually they are great pictures but had i of been there i would have freaked on his *(*&  Will have too see if i can get a copy of them."
22412,Carp,2007-01-14 22:31:00,1488,"Beauty bull moose.  Not usually an agressive, quite shy of people, but would you try and get close to a moose like that who doesn't seem to have any fear and is walking towards you rather than away from you ?"
22417,nautifish,2007-01-14 22:36:00,1416,I still cannot get over the size of that it's like the size of a blooming Elephant......
22418,urbanangler1990,2007-01-14 22:38:00,933,its huge! how much could she weigh?
22420,brookieman,2007-01-14 22:41:00,68,"Carp, Bull Moose can be one of the most aggressive mammals in North America, especially during the mating season.  The problem with Moose is they can go crazy and put you up a tree (or van) with no warning.  Definately wouldn't be getting that close to one."
22422,danc,2007-01-14 22:44:00,4677,"Judging from the velvet on the rack and how green the landscape is, I'd say these photos were taken in the spring/early summer. Not mating season. But he certainly doesn't seem shy. What an incredible animal."
22428,nautifish,2007-01-14 23:04:00,1416,  I dunno but i would have to say pretty dern close to a TON if you ask me....Just the antlers alone on that beast musT have some weight to them....As for how close would i get to that animal for a pic...Not that blooming close that i do know.....
22432,Rich Clemens,2007-01-14 23:28:00,3131,That guy's HUGE !
22438,Cookslav,2007-01-14 23:45:00,1457,"That is a picture perfect bull...healthy, big, and definatly not a force to be reckoned with LOL..."
22443,Roy,2007-01-14 23:51:00,13728,Moose is mean folks when they wanna be... http://www.gofish.com:80/player.gfp?gfid=30-14670
22473,fishindevil,2007-01-15 00:33:00,6254,"wow roy that was quite a video,  and that moose lookes small compared to the other one,if he were to stomp  on you like that you would surely be a dead duck....OUCH    and yes that big bull was even bigger than that  van he is huge,you would not want to p*** him off"
22476,Garyv,2007-01-15 00:36:00,547,Years back just a last light we had a bull come up out of the culvert on 560 going from Gowganda to Elk Lake.  At the time I had a GMC 3/4 full size diesel van.  The lower portion of his head was about at eye level through my windshield and the rack towered above the van.  Largest bull I have ever seen to this day.  Oh yeah he just walked slowly across the road as if to say you hit me were all going to be done!  Moose are not the most predictable animals especially in rutting season OR when black flies at thick in the bush.
22486,dr_freelgood,2007-01-15 01:06:00,13,"I remember one time in Algonquin, that another canoe pair from our group got so close that the guy in the bow said he could nurse from the cow."
22519,Canuck2fan,2007-01-15 02:15:00,1444, I hope he intended to pet her first.... before he got that intimate.
22527,xrap,2007-01-15 02:36:00,683,
22529,ChrisK,2007-01-15 02:39:00,2772,This gives you an idea of how tall they would be if they stood up on their hind legs...And this is just a young fella that weighed about 700lbs....My first bull was a giant at about 1300lbs.....
