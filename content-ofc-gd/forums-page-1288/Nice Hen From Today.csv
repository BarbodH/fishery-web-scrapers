So i get to the river and the water looks prime. I put on a pink worm First drift FISH ON!! lost it after a few minutes but it was a nice one 10 - 12 lbs atleast.  After re - tying i put on a roe bag BAM fish on, nice hen was a bleeder so i had to take her home. Water was surprisingly warm and the fight was good.  Also got some roe out of her "

22178,dave kaeon,2007-01-14 05:08:00,13,mmm... steelhead candy. like taffy but for mister and missus trout!  did you happen to check the stomach contents too? pretty sure you'd find a few late spawning brown's eggs in there and definitely scads of those green caddis rockworms. you remember that clump of them the other one spat out? i also noticed quite a few fresh stone husks drifting around the backeddies today.  rolypoly football!  
22179,FishFinder,2007-01-14 05:15:00,481,lol the stomach was empty to make room for all the roe nah i didnt take a look at what was inside Thanks for taking the pic man!
