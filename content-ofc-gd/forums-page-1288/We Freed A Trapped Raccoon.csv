22168,kayak fisher,2007-01-14 04:32:00,66,"Right on bud, glad to hear it!  There should be more people like you and I around, and this board is pretty indicative of that sentiment.  Good for you.  Happy fishing."
22200,Vanselena,2007-01-14 12:49:00,269,Came across two raccoon's once sleeping in a hollowed tree. I can tell you those raccoon's won't be bothering the farmers corn field anymore.
22205,lew,2007-01-14 13:14:00,12767, I guess you & me look at life differently ......
22211,Mike the Pike,2007-01-14 13:24:00,3421,Nice to see you tried to save the little critter at least he didn't die in that hole .What a great effort by you going home and getting the tools to release the racoon and spending over an hour getting him out.Most people would not bother.Thanks Lew that was the best story of 2007 .Mike
22216,Photoz,2007-01-14 13:32:00,792,"HARK!  The self appointed guru / prophet of the Simcoe board expells some of his great knowledge & opinions upon us . . .      ? Perhaps he should hook up with Peter & go back to whence he came? And Lew . . . .    my hat is off to you for your efforts, and even more for your restraint."
22218,Gerritt,2007-01-14 13:45:00,6129,"Lew, Good job on doing your part for helping a suffering animal... you certainly are different then most... alot of people would have just walked the other way not wanting to be bothered Good on yah!  Sorry to hear the little gaffer didn't make though. Perhaps it was for the best, noone wants to see an animal suffering like that.   Vansela, All animals on the face of the earth are here for a reason, it is by design. While you may think that a Raccoon is a meaningless lifeform I assure you there are thousands that will disagree.  Most Fishermen are outdoor lovers and in some way enviromentalists.. People wanting to take care of mother nature and respecting the enviroment.. there are exceptions to every rule however and these people are usually identified quickly. Thank you for putting your hand up in the air.  Gerritt."
22258,POLLIWOGG,2007-01-14 16:07:00,835,"reality check.  Ever heard of rabies,  healthy coons don't get stuck? Fungus from coon poop can kill you, Joey you got a problem. Ontario is infested with racoons.  Lew's a great guy an all but sometimes its better for all concerned, including the animal to put it down."
22284,lew,2007-01-14 17:17:00,12767," Well, the way I look at it, not everything we do in life is guaranteed to be safe, and if everyone just stood back and worried about what MIGHT happen some day, I'm afraid alot of things would never get accomplished.  What really pi$$ed me off yesterday was the attitude of a few morons who stopped to see what I was doing, kneeling in the mud, and chopping away at the tree for an hour. As soon as they realised it was ""only"" a raccoon that was trapped, they just laughed and walked away.  I have absolutely NO idea how anyone could just walk past this animal without at least trying to do  something to relieve it's suffering. It took me a grand total of 2 hours outta my life to help it, but at least I know I did something to relieve it's pain, while others somehow found it's pain to be amusing.  I spose I just think more of critters than some other folks do."
22293,Vanselena,2007-01-14 17:47:00,269,"Although I commend your efforts, I would never have saved that animal. Animals usually find a place to hide when they are about to die. You should find out if that animal was carrying rabies so you don't get more then you intended."
22298,Cookslav,2007-01-14 17:58:00,1457, Some people were not raised right...
22485,Squid,2007-01-15 01:05:00,1656,That is a great story Lew. Good on ya for helping out. Karma goes a long way
22570,Rattletrap2,2007-01-15 04:44:00,1652,"Hey Lew, you did the right thing. The rest was not up to you. At least YOU know you tried, and that is what counts."
22622,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-15 13:53:00,0,"Lew, as you know I was away for a couple of days and have just signed on.  Nice story with a bad ending, good on you for trying to help.  Ignore some of the peanut gallery."
22629,lew,2007-01-15 14:01:00,12767," Absolutely Jim, I just figure some of us live in better worlds than others."
22653,John,2007-01-15 14:37:00,2956,"Kudo's Lew, I would have done the same thing. Too bad some of us think in such a shallow manner. Wish it had turned out better, but you can gain some solice from the fact that your actions made sure that its' suffering was much reduced......"
21975,lew,2007-01-13 16:07:00,12767,"Early this morning before day break, me & the pooch were walknig thru the woods on our daily hike, when Marvin started whining at the base of a nearby tree. I walked over to see what was happening and saw what appeared to be a dead raccoon jammed up inside a hollow spot in the trunk right at groundlevel and between some roots.  As I was walking away I heard it make a growning sound so I went back, and sure enough it was alive but jammed solidly in the hole. He was sorta standing and facing me, but twisted around and hopelessly stuck and the poor thing looked terrified. I was able to reach him, so I put on my gloves and tried to twist him free but there was no way that was gonna happen without alot of the root and trunk being cut away, so I went home and got a hatchet, hammer and some big wood chisels, and then my daughter and I headed back down.  It took me an hour to cut enough of the trunk and roots away without injuring him, but finally there was enough room to get him out. We layed him on an old towel I had and he was breathing fine but was so exhausted he could hardly move. Alot of the hair had been worn away from the top of his head and on both front feet and legs from him trying to free himself, but he didn't appear to be injured and continually tried to bite me.......ungrateful little bugger  From the looks of him I'd guess he was stuck for at least a couple days and was just too stiff to even move, but my guess is he'll make it.  We were just kinda standing there trying to figure what to do next, when along comes a man who stopped to see what was happening. Just by a stoke of good luck, it turns out he volunteers for an animal sanctuary / animal rescue group. He used his cell and called their local vet, who also volunteers his services  free of charge for injured animals and he was coming over to get him. He said the raccoon was probably dehydrated and was even bringing an IV set-up to use on him while he took him back to his clinic which was about 30 minutes away.  He has a seperate section dedicated to rehabilitating wild critters and specializes in raccoons  I had an appointment this morning and couldn't wait any longer, so we wrapped the animal up in another blanket and put it on the front seat of the other guys car with the heater going and he was gonna wait for the vet to show up and get him.  He'll call me later to day and let me know how they made out.  I know alot of folks think of raccoons are a nuisance, and yes they are, but I'm a HUGE animal lover and there's no way I could leave that poor critter trapped like that. I told my daughter that I'd take the whole tree down if neccessary and worry about the consequenses later.  Anyways, that's how I spent my morning and just thought a few more of you animal lovers may find it interesting."
21977,Joey,2007-01-13 16:18:00,9122,"Well that was certainly an exciting moring Lew.  I have racoons in my attic, and yes they are a nuisance, but they were probably here first and ""WE"" invaded their spot, so they probably think we're a nuisance  I've had a few experiences helping them out too and they sure are cute.  Good for you, you probably saved his life.  Joey"
21983,Carp,2007-01-13 16:30:00,1488,"I'm a hunter Lew, but also an animal lover. Talk about contradicting statements.  Leaving an animal to suffer like that would be a terrible. You did the right thing.  YOU DA MAN !!!"
21984,Bernie,2007-01-13 16:32:00,3190,That was quite the episode lew..Good for you and your good heart.
22000,motv8tr,2007-01-13 17:43:00,2587,"Good stuff Lew, I'm not sure I could have done that, but I would have called someone to come get him out.  I bet the little gaffer will be gratefull once he's feeling better  Maureen"
22002,crappiesteve,2007-01-13 17:51:00,220,"Lew,that was very good of you to help that racoon  and go figure the rascal nearly bit you to thank you,WTG bud.  Steve"
22007,Eddyk,2007-01-13 18:18:00,195,"Once a Fireman, Always a fireman. Why dont you take him over Bryant Av and release him. Racoons like that area."
22012,ChrisK,2007-01-13 18:50:00,2772,Well done Lew. Your going to sleep well tonight knowing you ended his suffering saved his life....Shure he may only be a racoon but he is still one gods creatures and deserved to have another chance at life.I'm just glad you found him.....
22014,Mike the Pike,2007-01-13 18:55:00,3421,Great story Lew .You helping the racoon avoided  a slow death and suffering.Let us know about his progress.
22020,Greencoachdog,2007-01-13 19:24:00,8163,"Good on Marvin, You, and your Daughter for savin' the poor little guy Lew! You've got some good animal Karma comin' your way!"
22029,fishindevil,2007-01-13 20:08:00,6254,well lew thats a well done good deed...and im sure he thanks you for doing that...cheers
22037,GbayGiant,2007-01-13 20:24:00,1780," Good job Lew, you got karma coming your way instead of a conscense kickin ya in the butt for leaving it."
22045,Nemo,2007-01-13 21:02:00,727,Nice work.. Sort of Catch and Release Racoon.  Just don't tell that Glen guy I think they eat them or something?
22053,lew,2007-01-13 21:44:00,12767,"Sad news folks, we just got a call from the vet and the little guy died an hour ago.  The vet had him at his office and said he seemed to be doing much better, but then suddenly went downhill and that was it.  I'll never stand by and watch an animal suffer and at least I know I did all I could for him and  his last few hours weren't spent suffering while he was jammed inside that tree trunk.  Damn....."
22055,TAH,2007-01-13 21:50:00,133,you did your best lew thats all one could ask for
22060,lilkynan,2007-01-13 22:08:00,173,If this method was applied to helpless kids and the elderly - our world would be a better place. But it takes a real human to save animals and people - WTG Lew - see you at the Fishing show
22062,Daplumma,2007-01-13 22:17:00,1961,"Good on ya Lew,its just the right thing to do.I also hunt but have also released a deer caught in a fence while hunting.I cant stand to see any animal suffer.Too bad about the critter,you did what you could! Joe"
22070,danc,2007-01-13 22:40:00,4677,"Very nice story Lew, but with a not so nice ending. You should be proud of your efforts though. Sleep well tonight Bud.."
22074,pameladallaire,2007-01-13 23:00:00,470,You have a good heart Lew.  All we can do is our best.  Pam
22077,ChrisK,2007-01-13 23:04:00,2772,Sorry to here about the racoon Lew....All we can do is try our best and the rest is left up to greater forces....I'm shure your good deed will be noted by the big guy upstairs.....
22096,RobHall,2007-01-13 23:35:00,261,Man that sucks.  Your heart was in the right place Lew.  Unfortunately things didnt work out for the poor little critter.
22103,Moosebunk,2007-01-13 23:43:00,3970,Sorry to hear Lew
22123,OhioFisherman,2007-01-14 00:24:00,6623,"Lew, you tried, sorry it didn`t work out."
22149,Crazyhook,2007-01-14 02:52:00,1154,"Nice work Lew, good animal Karma!"
22165,Cookslav,2007-01-14 04:18:00,1457,They say you can tell allot about a person based on how they treat animals... Your oviously a very compasionate man. Good on you for trying.
