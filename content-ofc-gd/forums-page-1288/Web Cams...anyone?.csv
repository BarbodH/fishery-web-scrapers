22310,pigeonfisher,2007-01-14 18:52:00,696,we have gone through two web cams that don't really work on our computer.  Either the camera works and not the microphone or vice-versa.  Does anyone have any good success stories with these things?  Are they all lemons?  We run windows XP and that is all I know.
22314,ChrisK,2007-01-14 19:05:00,2772,"Yup,got the same problemo...Camera/mike seems to work when I test it but then I go to MSN the mike portion doesn't seem to kick in....So,I turn off the mike on the webcam and use a head set with a mike when I'm on MSN instead....I'm also running XP  Cheers !!"
22328,Tdel,2007-01-14 19:31:00,393,I am using a  Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX and I don't have any complaints.  Takes great video and it is easy to send video as an email.  Sometimes my window locks up but that is only when I use full screen viewing(Full Screen Picture).  I am fairly sure that all I need to do is add more memory to my computer to solve that problem.

22427,danc,2007-01-14 23:03:00,4677,I have a Logitech cheapie that's probably 6 or 7 years old. It's worked fine with several different computers and operating systems.
