506264,HTHM,2010-09-24 01:10:00,4082,"I am working my very first trade show representing my employer, I get a call from the fellow rigging my motor telling e the controls I supplied won't fit. Around $260 for the right ones....My daughter is getting married in a week and a half, not happining. I will have to wait unless I can find a sidemount control box in the next day. Then my wife calls to tell me that our oldest has miscarried in her forth month. Bursting into tears in the middle of a trade show is apparently not considered professional behavior. I don't care, I carry my heart on my sleeve and that is all there is to it. Then my second oldest calls to tell me the van I sold, has been vandalized. Mirrors broken, wiper arm bent and the taillights broken. Not a fun phone call to make to the buyer. So, right now I am waiting for my wife to get home from the hospital, and hope that we can all find the Lords comfort. So how's your day going????"
506267,bigugli,2010-09-24 01:18:00,6138,I do dearly feel for you. It's too much to have dumped on your plate in one day. I hope your daughter will recover quickly. She is the priority concern at this moment .  Take care.

506284,NAW,2010-09-24 02:24:00,4022,Keep you head up bud.  Sounds like your family really needs you right now.  My heartfelt condolences regarding the misscarriage..
506285,Nipfisher,2010-09-24 02:26:00,2449,No real nice way to put this but miscarriage usually means the baby (fetus) was not healthy. My wife miscarried in 2006. Our 1st boy is now 7 and we were lucky enought to have another boy in 2009. Both are healthy. I am sending my prayers to your daughter and your family. I pray that all things work out for you. If you're not a grandpa yet you'll make one heck of one. Take care.
