Tried it out yesterday and did very well in about 6-8 ft of water, caught fish on almost every third cast. Interesting lures though, although for some reason, I felt pretty dirty using them, not sure why?  Any thoughts on these lures?"

I just dont really like fishing that way, it's too damn easy.  I fished my spots on the rainy river, as normal, and even with cold weather this past week, I still landed alot of big smallies, about 30 in two hours. Biggest was a tad under 5lbs, but the average was probably close to 4 lbs."
