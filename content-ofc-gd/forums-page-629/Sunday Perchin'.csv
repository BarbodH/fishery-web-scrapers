505796,danbouck,2010-09-22 20:48:00,4380," ya I'm finding the same thing this year   It's been a great boat, I'll send you some pics   you know it!"
505123,danbouck,2010-09-20 01:22:00,4380,"I got an unexpected ""free"" day today so I went down to the cottage to do some perchin. It was too short notice for everyone so I headed out alone. I didn't get down there until 11 and didn't hit the water until noon. I figured I would spend some time and get the boathouse organized. It turned out to be a perfect day weather wise. Slight chop turned to glass by the end of the day.  I ventured out and seen the pack of boats at EC10.    I was going to go over but I went to one of my honey holes instead.  I managed to get the last dozen minnows around and they turned out to be some fine minnows. I threw my line in the water, set my rod down to grab my coffee and in the two seconds... 11"" perch    I only had a dozen minnows so I ended up using a couple minnows to get the fish in and feeding, then switched up to gulp alive for a couple fish. When they stopped hitting that, back to a live minnow. I kept switching it up and it worked out great. The minnows ended up lasting a couple hours. Mind you I nearly dove in the water to grab a few    Not many pics were taken due to me being solo and the fact that the perch were always keeping me busy. Here are some scenery shots from the day.        I ended up going for a cruise out on the lake but when I got into 4-5 footers I turned around and headed back in. Ray's dog came over to play with me and ended up hanging around for a while. Jacob spends hours playing with him.    I kept just enough perch to fill my bucket which only ended up being 17 but only 4 were under 10"" and they were only kept because of deep hooks.    BTW it's a wide board    After getting them all cleaned I gave it all to my mom. Next week I'm getting a limit!"
505128,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-20 01:44:00,2690,"Next week I might be out there too!  Nice Dan, sure pays to stay away from the EC 10 pack at times."
505130,bananaweed,2010-09-20 01:46:00,6,Great pics. Nothin' beats a relaxing day of fishing.
505146,limeyangler,2010-09-20 02:24:00,5204,"Had to laugh Dan, many a trip out has seen my buddies and me trying to get walleye in the boat before the head shake that tosses the minnow, then the frantic scramble to grab the minnow before it sinks...running out of bait sucks when the bite is on!  BTW...what is the limit for perch....dont know many who target them up here."
505157,Joey,2010-09-20 02:44:00,9122,"Nice Dan, lucky mom     Hahaha, almost looks like a tornado in that third pic  Joey"
505162,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-20 02:50:00,2050,"Right on buddy! I knew I should have texted you or something!    we decided to go out last minute for a couple hours... Ginny's grandmother lives next door to Aker's so we went down for dinner and launched out of there.  It was just to get luke out on the water for the first time but we caught all kinds of little perch so the kids had fun!!  I might try to sneak out again next sunday...  Cheers, Ryan"
505190,corvette1,2010-09-20 11:56:00,1765,nice day on the water dan i went out on sat got a doz perch then 5to6 footers blew me off the water thats erie
505196,smally21,2010-09-20 12:06:00,993,"nice perch dan - hoping to make several trips to Erie thru the perch season - i seem to be at dover when they're at Pottohawk, or at mailtland when they're at woolleys - but thats fishing.  limey 50 is the limit for perch."
505213,skinny,2010-09-20 12:55:00,442,I will be out there on Sunday after our little perch eating fest here everyone is wanting more
505355,danbouck,2010-09-20 21:24:00,4380," I never fish EC10, I have very good success elsewhere. Maybe someday I'll share them with you... maybe   Couldn't agree more!   As Smally said the limit is 50. I usually keep my kids little net in the boat because it is perfect for scooping minnows and ya running out sucks.   Ya she was happy   I'll probably be out next Saturday, we'll see what happens. I am making a fish cleaning station for the boathouse with running water next week to make things easier. I'm expecting a lot of perch this year   Ya I never make it out too far in the lake before it explodes   This time of year you will get them almost everywhere in the bay   I'll let you know where I find them"
505359,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-20 21:49:00,2690, Ve Have Vays of Making you talk
505377,Kinger,2010-09-20 22:54:00,351,"Starting to look like mini-walleye at that size, very nice! And thanks for making me extra hungry!!!"
505385,danbouck,2010-09-20 23:13:00,4380," no prob   BTW the new Pflueger Trion that I picked up off ebay is the perfect Perch reel, I matched it with a 5'6"" Shimano rod and 6lb flouro"
505387,HTHM,2010-09-20 23:18:00,4082,"I am hoping to go out perchin with you in about three weeks, but we will be in my boat...if you don't mind I need some waypoints for the GPS..."
505389,danbouck,2010-09-20 23:20:00,4380, I think I can handle that! BTW I am pondering over your pump question
505393,Billy Bob,2010-09-20 23:46:00,5865,Your perch fishing trip blows mine right out of the water with all them NICE pictures....I never think of doing that and or too lazy to take them...if it wasn't for my cell phone camera I would never have any pictures of my fish....DUH !  Bob
505397,HTHM,2010-09-20 23:49:00,4082,We can look at it then.
505432,Leecher,2010-09-21 01:21:00,7832,"Nice bunch of perch Dan Nothing like a good feed and good on you to give them to your mom..... I do the same with specks and eyes    She just loves them  Question: Do you find parasites on them?  Up here, they seemed to be infested..... the reason I don't keep them anymore  Leechman"
505433,ra95,2010-09-21 01:24:00,49,"Interesting, how come Erie Lake's perch comes earlier than the north lake:Simcoe?"
505447,danbouck,2010-09-21 02:19:00,4380," I usually take 50 - 100 pictures on most outings. I just forgot the camera and had to use the blackberry this time.   no parasites in these. I've never had them in any perch in Long Point, as clean as can be   There are always around down here, just harder to find in the summer"
505455,SBCregal,2010-09-21 02:57:00,688,"man, looks like we should've gone out.  we ended up not going to long point PP and headed to rock point PP.  kickin myself now  ryan"
505573,danbouck,2010-09-21 21:52:00,4380,"I was wondering how you made out, how was Rock Point?"
505576,SBCregal,2010-09-21 22:00:00,688,"the park was nice, we didnt do any fishing at all.  we're hoping to get out a day this week, but the weather isnt looking too good."
505582,oldphart,2010-09-21 22:37:00,665,"~~~Heading out Sat., & Sun. most likely, I'll be just out side of the Armada, Been out twice, and been on the Perch, finding them about 3 weeks early in their cycle."
505616,moparhawk,2010-09-22 01:01:00,146,nice fishing but I actually would like to see a picture of your boat. Dont think I've ever seen a legend but it looks well built
