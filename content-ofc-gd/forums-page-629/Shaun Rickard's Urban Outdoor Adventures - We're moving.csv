502317,smally21,2010-09-08 12:08:00,993,i was number 66? do i get a prize?  good luck shaun we'll await the new shows.
502320,Handlebarz,2010-09-08 12:14:00,3790,"Hey Shaun welcome back you were missed as you know there are a lot of people here that like your show a lot I hope that you miss the 1 million by 1 person as I don't think that some one need to be rewarded for calling out a non spam thread   even if you have been missing for a bit now but anyone who has been here long enough knows that as this family is like many others some drift away with there off line life and will come back, just one check to your profile could have told them that you were a long time member.  Bassman I don't mean any disrespect to you but it seems there are to many who right away get on the   wagon before knowing what is going on I also find it funny that you did not remember Shaun from years gone by as you have also been here for a long time I am not taking a shot at you at all just hope others will look at it as a positive and give long time members a chance for there posts just send a message to the MODS.  I think it is great that your show will be back as it was another good show to watch right now there are not that many good shows out there I don't want to mention others that are great shows as this is not about there shows they know how we feel any way but just wanted to be another to give you props for a great show that had a good following.  I will also join the facebook page and look forward to the new shows."
502323,I'mHooked,2010-09-08 12:30:00,525,"1 Million? That's only 2740 per day  , Bassman, the boat's as good as yours!"
502325,bassman,2010-09-08 12:32:00,384,"I have been an OFNer for a while and I do remember Shaun previous contributions and I am a fan of the show. Now Shaun, can you give me details on the boat, including value. I need to crunch some numbers before I set out on my campaign. As an fyi, I work in Information Technology, are you scared yet Wanna grab a coffee sometime?"
502329,smally21,2010-09-08 12:54:00,993,"sink it at 999,999 - then throw bassman the keys. its all yours!"
502332,tb4me,2010-09-08 13:12:00,3295,"We dont do facebook here..Horrible site in our opinions anyway, good luck to you and please keep us posted on when the show airs!"
502372,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-08 16:27:00,144," I already did mercman, it just hasn't aired yet. I shot a Musky episode with Marc Thorpe on the St. Lawrence just outside Montreal, and I boated my first 50 inch Musky! Pictrure of the beauty below    Cheers, Shaun"
502373,Headhunter,2010-09-08 16:32:00,5703,"Nice fish Shaun! But, if I recall correctly, smiles are frowned upon by Mr. Thorpe! HH"
502374,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-08 16:44:00,144," bassman, sorry for the delayed response, my camera was in for repair and I wanted to post a picture. I took a couple of nice shots but I think this one really showcases the many features and clean lines that this boat has to offer. As for value I'll leave that up to you to determine...                                             Cheers, Shaun"
502376,Rod Caster,2010-09-08 16:57:00,5784,Is that modified milk crate included in the deal?

501585,bassman,2010-09-05 19:05:00,384,Methinks this may be  My apologies if you've already bought some ads.
501598,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-05 20:48:00,144,"Bassman, I'm asking members, if they so choose, to Like a Facebook page, I'm not tryong to sell you anything. If you feel the post is inappropriate then ask the admins to take it down. It's not spam, I'm simply sharing and looking for some support from those who wish to give it, if you don't then that's your choice.  Thanks."
501606,Stern Rules,2010-09-05 21:47:00,342,I'm with you Shaun.
501608,bassman,2010-09-05 21:59:00,384,It's still SPAM. Correct me if I'm wrong admins.
501610,Roy,2010-09-05 22:08:00,13728,"Let it be, Bassman. Shaun has been with us since the beginning. He's contributed to our community and, as such, deserves respect from others here."
501615,bassman,2010-09-05 22:23:00,384,"By that logic, does Mercer get a refund?  This would be easier to digest if there was a contest associated to the free ad, unless of course you really want to give away your Princecraft  BTW, I do enjoy your show Shaun."
501626,solopaddler,2010-09-05 23:23:00,8605, That's funny.
501684,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-06 03:33:00,144," How about this Bassman, if I hit 1 million likes I'll give you my Princecraft... no lol's this time, I'm serious. Now I have set you a challenge, and I will honour it! The deadline is 12 months from the date of this this post!  Cheers, Shaun"

501744,mbac31,2010-09-06 13:42:00,904,"Shaun, you might just have your hands full.Lol. I know Bassman and he is determined.I think he might be fishing out of a Princecraft next year.  Lol. Great idea. Just to let everyone know. We should not be quick to judge. This is a very informative ""Canadian"" show that we should support in mass. No different than Izumi, Kalaonka, Charlie, etc. We need to show full support on these shows. Look what we have all done for OFC community. I have pasted this to all my friends on Facebook to join. I for one love this show and its content."
501748,Roy,2010-09-06 13:49:00,13728, Good for you! Thanks for that...being negative is just not a good scene.
502230,thalweg,2010-09-07 23:48:00,112,Bassman.... all I gotta say is
502233,bassman,2010-09-07 23:55:00,384,What's the boat worth Shaun?
502254,danbouck,2010-09-08 01:21:00,4380,I will click like if you promise to not give him a boat!
502255,bassman,2010-09-08 01:23:00,384,Haters!
502258,tdotfisherman,2010-09-08 01:25:00,317,"Urban Outdoor Adventures was a great show, and I learned so much about fishing in the GTA by watching that show.  I can't wait for the new season.  Best of luck Shaun."
502275,mercman,2010-09-08 02:12:00,7054,"hey shaun, don't think i've ever seen your show,but if you'll do a show on fishing in the st lawerence near Montreal, i'll join facebook and ""like"" you too"
502291,Rattletrap2,2010-09-08 03:35:00,1652,"Good luck with the new show Shaun. For the life of me, i cant see where this show is aired or when? I did enjoy the show a few years back, but have not seen any episodes in a long time. What does TBC mean from your website? Thanks"
502304,Tarzan's Jane,2010-09-08 10:00:00,1183,Awesome for you Bassman - sure hope you get that boat!
502311,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-08 11:24:00,144," Thanks smalliefisher, much appreciated"
502313,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-08 11:27:00,144," Rattletrap2, TBC means to be confirmed. We have a pretty good idea where it's going to air but haven't signed anything yet, hence the TBC. We have a lot of work ahead of us to make this happen so your support is much appreciated.  You can keep an eye out for updates etc. on the official show website too: http://www.shaunrickard.com  Cheers, Shaun"
