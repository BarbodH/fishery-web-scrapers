506261,GBW,2010-09-24 00:51:00,8460,"Hey all.  Does anyone want to hook up and go fishing this weekend?  My wife's got her sister and kid's coming over (and my bro-in-law cannot make it now due to work) so the Mrs just told me to get out and go fishing! WOO HOO!!  I may make the drive up to 4 mile lake but if anyone here want's to hook up then I'll do that instead.  Post here or PM me, cheers.  Geoff"
506266,ketchenany,2010-09-24 01:14:00,3229,Hope you have a good time . . . I did get out to Brooklin on Wed and Thurs. afternoon to visit my first grand daughter who arrived in this world all healthy on Monday. And also visited one of my typography teachers who lives at Anderson and Winchester.

506366,GBW,2010-09-24 14:26:00,8460,Congrats!  Next time you are going to vist PM me.  Thanks Will.  I think I'm heading to Chemong on Sat now.
506511,GBW,2010-09-24 20:49:00,8460,"*bump* well plans have changed on me and I'm not happy about it...  no, not from the person that invited me to Chemong.  I have two options right now. 1, go to my folks place (round trip 3 hrs) and fish for a few hrs. or 2, hook up with someone from the board that can do a 1/2 to 2/3 day of fishing tomorrow close to home.  My big boat has gone to sleep for the season but my tinny is ready if I go to my folks place to fish.  Anyone want to get out in the Durham area?  I may do some shore fishing or head up to the boat, duno..."
506527,fishindude,2010-09-24 21:24:00,220,What's considered close to home/Durham? I'm in Richmond Hill and wouldn't mind getting out for a 1/2 or 2/3 of the day tomorrow. PM me if you're leaning towards your choice #2
506531,GBW,2010-09-24 21:29:00,8460,I'm interested.  just that i don't have a boat unless i go to the cottage.  i would rather stay to a 1 hr drive each way to get more time fishing.
