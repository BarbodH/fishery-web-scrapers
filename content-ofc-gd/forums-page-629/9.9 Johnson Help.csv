It's a 1983 9.9 Johnson that has worked well for many a years, was running perfect until a couple of weeks ago. motor gets used regularly.  starts first pull cold or hot. it runs out of gas, tried different hoses and tanks, 3 hoses and 3 tanks all work on the other motors we have. put new plugs, didn't think that was the problem anyways but for 15 bucks it was worth the try. tried a fuel pump from another motor and still the same, old pump works on the other motor so I don't think that is the problem. when it is going to stall if I pump the primer bulb it keeps running. if and when it stalls there is no fuel in the lines. I keep wanting to blame the pump, line or tank but why do they work on the other motors.  Thanks in advance for any help.  KW Mike"

506294,Mahumba,2010-09-24 03:33:00,28,Check the gas line inside the cover of the motor. Start right where you plug the tank line in and check for leaks. Work your way to the carb. All it takes is a small pin hole for your motor to stop sucking gas. If you have to squeeze the bulb to keep the motor running it means your line is sucking air somewhere. I would just change that line or at the very least change the connections. These lines should be replaced every couple of years.  Roger

506362,Fisherman,2010-09-24 14:15:00,7201,"The OP has all but eliminated all the problems exterior to the motor, tried different tanks and hoses on different motors with no malfunction, so that eliminates the tank, the primer, the hose and the fuel pump on the motor in question which he tried on another motor.  My best suggestion, if he can get gas to the carb by pumping the primer, then there is a suction leak after the fuel hose connector on the motor up to the fuel pump."

506675,Carp,2010-09-25 02:28:00,1488,I had an older 35 hp outboard that had a similar problem. Turns out the fitting on the hose wasn't connecting tightly with the fitting on the motor. (air leak) I put a 5 cent rubber 'O' ring on the engine side of the fittings (male side) and that was enough to snug up the connection and eliminate the leak. Ran like a dream after that.
