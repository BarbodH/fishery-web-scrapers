Sorry about the pic's but I had to use my cell which wouldnt let me download to computer so i actually had to take a picture of my cell phone pics so i could put them in the computer......  Just got my curadoE7 baitcaster reel in so Im excited to get out there and give it a try, hopefully with some good hits!  L8R!  "
505479,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-21 12:19:00,0,Nice pickerel. Your going to love that new reel.
505483,Muskieman,2010-09-21 12:43:00,2472,Nice Walleye !!!  Congrats on the PB..   Randy 
505490,ehg,2010-09-21 13:27:00,2666,"Those are nice big walleye. The Canadian record walleye was caught in the Niagara at 22lbs 4 ounces many years ago, a salmon troller accidently snagged one in 1987 at 25 lbs. A world record might be there, maybe you can catch it"
505495,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-21 13:57:00,0,  Nice! Im gonna go back and try and break that record!!
505498,frozen-fire,2010-09-21 14:02:00,542,Wow...those are fatties!

505570,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-21 21:44:00,0,"  No go, it doesnt work. I have a company phone and there are restrictions, thats why I had to take pictures of the cell phone and then download from my camera......"
505655,BiggFish,2010-09-22 02:41:00,40,"Hey,  Those are some fat eyes, congrats.  I am not from NOTL area and have only fished the Niagara river once for Smallmouths, I think we launched near Lewiston at the free launch.  Are we talking about the same waters?  Cheers,  Chad"
505674,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-22 04:08:00,0,"  Ya pretty much, I was actually off shore fishing too! Am thinking of heading back down soon and tossing out some glow spoons, hey ya never know just like those beasty walleye that decided to feast....."
505755,fisherboy,2010-09-22 17:05:00,48,Nice catch.  The walleye are definitely in the river but I seldom target them. Usually they would come as accidental catch while drifting minnows for steelhead.
505787,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-22 19:43:00,0,  A nice accident i must say............
