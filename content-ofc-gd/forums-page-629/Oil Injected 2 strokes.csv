I'd love to have a 4 stroke, but, want some opinions on the oil injected 2 strokes. Should I stay away from it, and, wait for a 4 stroke deal to come along, or, check it out...less weight, etc.  The motor is still only eight years old, not a spring chicken but not a dinosaur either.  Thanks in advance, thinking of looking at this package on the weekend."
505765,Roy,2010-09-22 18:18:00,13728,Oil injected 2 strokes are good motors if they've been looked after.
505766,bow slayer,2010-09-22 18:22:00,1074,"  I say if the price is right go for it. Yamaha make great motors and a oil injected 2 stroke is not bad at least you don't have to mix. Also 8 years old for an outboard is nothing. After saying that if there is no rush I say wait til you find a 4 stroke if that is really what you want. I am on my second 4 stroke and I love them,quiet,no smoke ,no mixing oil,the only downside is the added weight."
505771,Fisherman,2010-09-22 18:38:00,7201,"This is the start of the season to look for good deals, people selling because they don't want to store over the winter or looking for something brand new next spring, personally, I'd look for a 4 stroke, the weight isn't much of an issue anymore."
505774,danbouck,2010-09-22 18:43:00,4380,"If your not in a hurry, make a list of exactly what you want and wait for the perfect deal"
505791,HTHM,2010-09-22 20:31:00,4082,"If I did that I would never get a less than 5 year old 18' Starcraft 160 hp I/O bowrider with 4 stroke 9.9 kicker for $100 Sheese, don't you know anything???!!!!"
505794,danbouck,2010-09-22 20:45:00,4380," I had one for sale yesterday for $98, where were you???"
505802,bassmasta,2010-09-22 21:14:00,27,my older 1988 Suzuki DT75 oil injected outboard is still running strong!  I say go for it!
505804,HTHM,2010-09-22 21:22:00,4082,"At that price....I'll take two, (maybe)"
505805,Sinker,2010-09-22 21:24:00,8692,I wouldn't hesitate. But if you want a 4 stroke.........just sayin.  s.
505809,Pigeontroller,2010-09-22 21:36:00,2793,"Keep lookin, if you think you want a 4 stroke, you won't be happy with that noisy, smelly 2 stroke!"
505814,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-22 22:00:00,2690,"Just to let you guys know, my current boat has a 15 hp 4 stroke.  So I'm used to it, was wondering if the oil injected 2 strokes smoke as badly as the older models?  Thanks,"
505978,Sinker,2010-09-23 12:36:00,8692,"No, they don't smoke as much as the older one. There is going to be smoke though. I kinda like the smell of a two stroke first thing in the morning  S."
505997,Uncle Buck,2010-09-23 13:20:00,1000,"After coming back from the Dominican Republic, they are running late 90's yamaha 2 strokes, these boats were used everyday, all day while we were down there for 2 weeks and i'm certain they see more use, then what we'd do with them up here...  i wouldn't hesitate if i were you..."
506007,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-23 13:41:00,2690,"Thanks, for the replies guys...the voice of reason has won out on this one.  Also had some very good advice from Spincast (THANKS RICK!!!!!!!).  After doing a bit of research into this boat, it isn't quite what I'm looking for.  Not wide enough, I would basically just be gaining a couple of feet in length. Thanks for the input. By the way if anyone is looking, the boat is at Macdonald Marine in Turkey Point...a 2002 Lowe Sea Nymph 16 fter for $6900. Comes with the motor stated in my post's title + bow mount trolling motor, GPS fishfinder, dual batteries and trailer.  I wasn't too impressed that they wouldn't grant a sea-test/trial."
506263,HTHM,2010-09-24 01:01:00,4082,"Anytime that happens, walk away. Would you buy a used car without a test drive?"
