505716,Chugger,2010-09-22 14:05:00,109,"Howdy Folks,  The wife and I are heading to Punta Cana mid November and I'm tasked with the job of finding us a day charter for some deep sea fishing.  Has anyone had any experiences good or bad with any of the operators out of there?  Any tips or recomendations are greatly appreciated.  Cheers, -Graeme"
505732,Gerritt,2010-09-22 15:08:00,6129,"Have fun in the DR! it is my favorite place in the south!  I have been on a couple charters in Punta Cana.  I have always used Mike. Top notch boats and equipment, reasonably priced too.  http://www.mikesmarina.info/  G"
505758,Chugger,2010-09-22 17:23:00,109,"Thanks Gerritt! I'll give tham a call and see what we can get set up.  Cheers, -G."
505760,Gerritt,2010-09-22 17:29:00,6129,"No sweat, have fun! what resort are you staying at?  Here is a good little forum for travel questions for the DR  http://debsdrtravels.proboards.com/index.cgi?  We have always done the shared charter... 100.00 Per person.. and both times we were alone without others, they will pick you up at you're hotel and drive you back. They keep the fish.... watch out for the flying fish! took one on the forehead last year!  Mike is a german living in the DR.. and is the most popular charter operator on the south coast.. his english is not perfect but understandable.. infact he is/was a member here..  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showuser=4763  <----his profile...   Take lots of pics!"
505761,Chugger,2010-09-22 17:36:00,109,"I'll be sure to take plenty of pictures.  Sounds like the sails won't be in, but we'll see.  Thanks again!"
505762,Gerritt,2010-09-22 17:38:00,6129,doubtful on the sails... but the mahi mahi/dorado are a riot!
505770,kickingfrog,2010-09-22 18:38:00,8333,"I'll see if I can find my receipt. The resort will have a package option, pick-up drop-off quick and easy. You'll pay a bit more for that convenience. If you are comfortable making deals then you will have no trouble finding someone to deal with.  This spring at Punta Cana "
505773,Chugger,2010-09-22 18:39:00,109,"Hey Gerrit, sorry forgot to answer your question.  We're staying at the Excellence Punta Cana"
505779,Chugger,2010-09-22 19:21:00,109,Wow!  Nice White Sail Frog.
505788,aplumma,2010-09-22 20:00:00,6896,Take a spool of 50 lb plus braid line or a few musky lures they are great for trading or tipping the captain. I  had a days charter for 100.oo and 2 lures with a a spool of 50 lb as a tip.   Art
505790,jimmer,2010-09-22 20:17:00,2730,"I think you have to pay to get a good outing.  I made deal with a local group and it was a scam as far as I was concerned.  We had a four hour boat tour with no hope of catching a fish out of that old boat.  I think we were lucky to make it back to shore, everything was falling off the boat and we got choked out from the fumes, not good when a few of the guys were hung over. LOL So, I guess my point is, if you make a deal for less $$$$, you get what you pay for."
505928,thalweg,2010-09-23 02:39:00,112,"Highly recommend packing some of your own travel gear for the often times great shore fishing.  Charters are hit and miss.  Make sure everyone has sea legs or bring lots of gravol.  I haven't fished Punta Cana...but every time I head to the Caribbean I always bring my own gear and have a riot.  Just got back from St. Martin and landed over 12 Tarpon within a 5 minute taxi ride from my hotel.  I brought Jerkbaits, swim baits and various plastics and they all worked great.  Just make sure you have the heaviest freshwater gear you can bring.  Ocean fish can be violent."
505934,Duckie,2010-09-23 02:58:00,305,"I agree on bringing a good travel rod and a 4000 size spinning reel loaded with 12 pound test mono.  St. Croix makes a very good 7 foot medium power fast action Premier Travel rod (3 pieces) that is really good. its rated for up to 5/8 oz lures and comes with a pvc rod tube for travel but it will fit in most suitcases. I got mine at basspro in Vaughn for around $200.  well worth the investment if you like to shore fish while on vacation. compared to the cost of the trip, $200 is nothing  enjoy your trip!"
505935,Paudash,2010-09-23 03:01:00,273,"go with someone that is recomended here, I booked through the hotel and paid $100 for a four hour boat ride"
