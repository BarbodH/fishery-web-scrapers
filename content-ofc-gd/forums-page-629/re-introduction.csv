501787,Beans,2010-09-06 16:31:00,3339,Welcome back Sis...  Wow...there is a blast from the past...it has been too long...  
501828,Jewelbee,2010-09-06 18:47:00,422,"Pleased to meet you Sis...I have no idea what happened to you, but I hope all goes well this time around."
501833,Big Cliff,2010-09-06 19:05:00,6899,"I have known both you and Dan since you became members of this board and if anyone has a problem with either of you they better be wearing high rubber boots because they are in a pile of crap.  Both of you have given so much to this board Sis, don't you worry about those who speak of what they don't know! You are both loved by many (well, all the important ones anyway!)  So glad to have you back!"
501843,splashhopper,2010-09-06 19:43:00,2931, welcome back...  what's a scammer
501844,Sis,2010-09-06 19:43:00,24,"Here's the Readers Digest version of my past few years. 2007, a lot of physical pain, trips to emerg, surgery end of November Dec 2007, diagnosed with cancer Jan 2008, stroke, few days in ICU- came out of it fine-don't look like a Picasso Winter thru spring chemo and radiation- HORRIBLE stuff 2009, we take our grandson to live with us- 2 yrs old And that's about it. I am fine, cancer free for almost 2 1/2 yrs now , Stuff happens, you deal with it and move on. ( I have to say ""stuff"" because we're not allowed to swear on here anymore lol) I'm happy, healthy and glad to be back nuff said on this thread"
501849,TennesseeGuy,2010-09-06 20:12:00,957,"Sis, you were one tough girl before and you've come back even stronger.  It's great that you're cancer free these days.  Best to you for continued recovery."
501893,fishnsled,2010-09-06 22:00:00,3520,It sure sounds llike you've had your battles over the last few years.  Great to have you back Sis.
501898,bigfish1965,2010-09-06 22:15:00,3382,"Good to see you back, Sis. Not sure why you have  the issue with the log in. I am at JewelBee's house now...logged in as her on Firefox and me on IE on the same laptop. Try a different browser see if that helps."
501906,Joey,2010-09-06 22:38:00,9122,"Paul logs in on his computer and I log in on my laptop, no issues, same brower and modem/router etc."
501913,Handlebarz,2010-09-06 23:00:00,3790,Welcome back Sis Last time I talked to you was back for the London trip that was just a few days ago still wish I was avaliable to make it for the day.  hope all is well way up nort there Eh
501924,tjsa,2010-09-06 23:17:00,1578,"Yup, that's the one for sure."
502617,Rattletrap2,2010-09-09 13:21:00,1652,"Good to see you back Sis! I never realized you were sick, but nice to hear that things are looking up. It has been a long while, but Dan is usually around when he can and has given us all a ton of good info on digital photography and beautiful Brookie pics! Unfortunately, Terence's funeral was a sad time for all of us. That was my first time meeting Spiel I believe, and truly a sad time to meet Gerritt. Hmmm.....Dan, it's about time you slowed down a bit with work and get us some more shots of monster trout! For me anyways, it is as close as i am about to get to those fish!  Mahumba was a colourful character! The last post i remember was about him falling off his deck and getting hurt! Maybe you can drag him back for a visit? Thunder Bay people in general are all decent folks in my books. We have two Apprentices in school right now from up there and are an absolute pleasure to have around!"
502796,TJQ,2010-09-10 00:34:00,7806,Hey... no scammers allowed....
503010,SlowPoke,2010-09-10 18:28:00,2984,"Nobody, and I mean NOBODY moves in on TJ's action!  Welcome back Sis!"
503094,lew,2010-09-11 22:52:00,12766,"Hey Sis, next time your talkin to Mahumba, will you please tell him I'm still waiting for the glass musky lures   he was sposed to send me  5 or 6 years ago.  He'll know what I'm talkin about   :lol:"
506176,Mahumba,2010-09-23 21:21:00,28,I'se still be checking in!  I've also been very busy. Tournament fishing is finally over and took it's toll on me. After 6 years the tournament I co-founded (but now single director) is the biggest live release tournament in the Thunder Bay area and also involved with the organization of two others.  I still have me full time job of twenty years and have been working part time at DnR Sporting Goods. We just had 7 Golden Retriever (9 were born though) puppies. My two kids are really growing and I'm proud to say my daughter fished an AYA event with me this year.  My wife is pretty much healed from her broken leg (5 places when the female retriever ran her over)  Other than that I have time for one meal a day and a bath once a week whether I need it or not!  Roger
506183,John,2010-09-23 21:49:00,2956,"Hey Roger, great to hear from you!"
506185,camillj,2010-09-23 21:55:00,1988,Welcome back Sis ... glad to hear things are lookin up for ya !
506186,Roy,2010-09-23 21:58:00,13728,"Raheem McHindu! Great to hear from you! Pop in from time to time...don't be shy, I enjoy your stories.  You and yours, be well."
501628,Sis,2010-09-05 23:29:00,24,"I've been a member of this board for the past 8 yrs but haven't been active for the last few.  Sometimes life throws stuff at us that need to be dealt with and I've been dealing with mine. I go by the nickname Sis and am the ""spouse"" of DanC.  I count quite a few people on here good friends including Joey, Roy, Gerritt, Spiel, Ron and Jeffy (TEP) just to name a few. One of the greatest things about this board is how everyone stands together to help a member and I will go above and beyond to do that. So just for clarification, I am not a scammer and if someone had just bothered to check my profile, probably would have realized that."
501630,Terry,2010-09-05 23:31:00,14456,good to have you back
501632,motv8tr,2010-09-05 23:35:00,2587,Good to hear from you Sis....hope all is going well...  Maureen
501635,Bly,2010-09-05 23:40:00,1556,"Nice to meet you Sis, I have heard many wonderful things about you"
501636,lew,2010-09-05 23:50:00,12766,It's definetely been a long time Sis and it's good to see you back on board.
501637,Sis,2010-09-05 23:59:00,24,"thanks everyone!  Good to be back!  I won't be contributing much to the fishing board as I haven't even been out in the boat yet this year with Dan up in Red Lake for the past 6 months.  I'm usually busy chasing our 3 yr old grandson who lives with us for the better part of the day. I am wondering though, if Roger Mayer and I still hold the record for the most replies generated in one hour?  Anyone remember that one? LOL"
501639,Terry,2010-09-06 00:11:00,14456,"I remember that but sadly , Mahumba doesn't visit here anymore....unless he changed his name   "
501649,Joey,2010-09-06 00:36:00,9122,"Heya Sis, I definately miss your posts on here, you were always a great contributor to this board, and a barrel of laughs aswell.  I remember when I joined you welcomed me with open arms and I've felt like your sister ever since.  I know we talk off site, but its nice to have you back on OFC  And I agree, if someone had checked your profile, it would have been a smart idea rather than the fallout we are dealing with now  Joey"
501656,highdrifter,2010-09-06 00:47:00,2534,Aye!  Get us some pichures..
501661,Roy,2010-09-06 01:11:00,13728,"Don't worry about a thing, Nita. You've always been one of the most selfless people on the board. We'll ""take care"" of the others.  You be well my friend."
501673,Fish Farmer,2010-09-06 02:02:00,2234,"Welcome back Sis, where's the pink fish avatar."
501675,Daplumma,2010-09-06 02:24:00,1961,"Been a while sis,good to see you back.I do remember the Roger Mayer and you post.You would be surprised how many old posters still lurk and communicate thru PMs here. Joe"
501678,Daplumma,2010-09-06 02:29:00,1961,"BTW miss the ""Sissy fish""."
501691,Joey,2010-09-06 03:55:00,9122,Was this it?    
501700,Big Cliff,2010-09-06 10:35:00,6899,"Welcome back Sis, it has been way too long!"
501718,aplumma,2010-09-06 12:50:00,6896,Welcome home Sis good to see you are alive and well.   Art
501723,Sis,2010-09-06 13:05:00,24,"ha ha ha @ pink fish.  I""ll have to see if I can find it again.  Nice to see that I'm remembered lol.  The biggest reason I did the re introduction, was because I'd pm'd a ton of people for something that shall remain unamed, but if your nick fell between M-Z, you probably got one from me.  Well, one of those members reported me to the mods for scamming and opened a great big ol' can of worms (not the fishing kind) Things have since smoothed over but I was really upset about it yesterday.  And to be honest, I hope whomever did it, feels like a complete arse   now and knows that a mods wife wouldn't be trying to scam anyone on here. This board is probably the biggest family in the world and it never fails to amaze me how we all pull together to help someone. Gerritt is the first person that comes to mind for me because I cried right along with him when Terry passed away, as did so many others.  It wasn't the first time this board reached out to help someone and definitely not the last.  Thank God for that I do have a question though,  Dan and I have both tried to be logged in to the board at the same time and one of us always gets booted out.  We're guessing it's some kind of security setting for ip addresses but not sure.  Anyone else experience this? I'll also try and get some  pics up soon lol. Thanks again everyone Sis"
501726,Terry,2010-09-06 13:11:00,14456,where you logging in on the same computer or different computers
501734,Sis,2010-09-06 13:18:00,24,Different computers Terry.  Him on the laptop and myself on pc.  Maybe it's our router?  I dunno
501739,Terry,2010-09-06 13:26:00,14456,"then if almost has to be part of the programing of this website, a security feature I guess  you can find a ip proxy site and one of you use it and the problem will be solved  the best thing to do is if you use firefox then set it up on IE and only use it for this website. that way you don;t have to keep turning the proxy on and off http://www.google.ca/search?q=ip+proxy+site&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a"
501752,tjsa,2010-09-06 14:21:00,1578,"Sorry, have no clue how to do multiple quote responses, but here goes...............   Hey Nita, welcome back.

Some posts that have been locked down may have more replies, but I doubt an unlocked post has beat that one.  ""I remember that but sadly , Mahumba doesn't visit here anymore....unless he changed his name""  he has not changed his username, he is just busy. He does read this board frequently though.
