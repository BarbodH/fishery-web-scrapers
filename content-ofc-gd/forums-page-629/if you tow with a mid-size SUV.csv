505459,Raf,2010-09-21 03:53:00,3495,"well, I got a real good deal on a Grand Cherokee... with a v8.   Mileage wise, the I6 4.0L and V8 4.7L are really just about the same.  15/20 for the I6, 14/20 cty/hwy for the V8.  That ole 4.0L is a bulletproof motor (my current XJ has 400,000 on the clock) but not terribly efficient.  I did the math and if I did strictly city driving, it's a difference of roughly $5 every 1000kms.  It'll take a lot of miles before the extra fuel cost adds up to what I've seen other vehicles cost.  And yes, it's a Jeep thing. I looked at other vehicles but in the end, the heeps have everything I am looking for."

Honestly Raf Im not gonna tell whats best cause i really dont have that answer, just take some of the advice u see here and go test out some and see what feels best for you, thats what its gonna boil down too............  Good luck and let us know what you get!"
505469,lew,2010-09-21 09:22:00,12766,Congrats on the new ride Raf and you'll be happy you went with the bigger V-8. I never heard anybody ever say they wished they had less power.
505476,John,2010-09-21 11:33:00,2956,Good choice on the V8 Raf. I went from a 4.0L Grand Cherokee to the V8 last year and the difference in towing especially uphill is significant.  The only thing is while the hwy gas mileage is about the same the city gas mileage is much different than they claim.
505487,ehg,2010-09-21 13:17:00,2666,"Looks like you made the right choice Raf, being familiar with the vehicle should help in most ways.  Went for a ride in a Subaru Forester turbo recently(towing trailer) it was pretty solid as well. Keep fishing dude"

505736,Bigfisherman,2010-09-22 15:24:00,100, Not only that but with 4x4 traction you can floor it from a start and still pass some slow pokes. Jeep 4.7L V8 here also:)
505754,fisherboy,2010-09-22 16:57:00,48,"If you only have 1000 lbs to tow, you can get by with a small SUV. If you don't have a big budget, why not try the top-level RAV4? Nothing fancy but it probably fits the bill. I myself drive a 2001 Acura MDX and my boat + trailer is probably around 2000 lbs. No problem so far although I don't mind having a bit more HP. The new generation MDX has a lot more power though -- I tried it and even got a speeding ticket while towing."

Seriously though.......I had a 2004 Ford Escape and it was OK but not like a truck....stopping power and SEEING over the boat while towing in truck is very nice.....also SUV's tend to cost more, sometimes much more for a smaller vehicle.

Back seats as same as an Explorer which is good becuase we have 2 boys and a dog. With the towing package I have been able to pull everything I have tried. I had a tent trailer and that was no problem. I have a tandem axle 4x8 utility trailer and with a full load of fire wood or bricks it was no prob. As well as my 17' Starcraft with 90hp Yam. IMO it is the absolute best utility type vehicle on the road today. The 2010's are gorgeous.  That being said, living in North Bay I would buy a crew cab F150 in a heartbeat if my wife would let me.  P.S. my favourite vehicle before this one was my 1995 Jeep Cherokee Sport with the 4.0 litre H.O. engine. I'd drive on the lake through snow that was over my hood and pull an ice shack to boot."
484978,John,2010-07-13 14:43:00,2956,"Raf, you might want to consider a Jeep Liberty with the CRD (common rail diesel). Fuel consumption was pretty good and they will pull a house down. Not a huge amount of room inside, but overall a pretty good SUV."
485020,Fish4Eyes,2010-07-13 17:47:00,1022," Worst thing you could do. They are unbelievably unreliable. Leave it to a German to make a diesel engine. If I was you Raf, I would be looking at a Cherokee CRD (with the Mercedes motor) or a 4runner. I have a 96 4Runner myself, and it had the most trunk space of all SUV's I looked at in its class. Not to mention, I get 13L/100km towing a 14.5 w/40hp and full camping gear. I can make it to Lakair from Hamilton on 1 tank. It could use a litte more power I will admit, but you have a smaller boat like me so it will serve you just fine."
485025,Fisherman,2010-07-13 18:18:00,7201,"Seems kinda strange that there's a lot of people looking for them because they are reliable and cheap to drive, as for 13l/100km, I do better than that with a Dodge CTD, use 12.5l/100km and I could probably put your rice burner in the back with all the kit and not drop much.."
485027,Billy Bob,2010-07-13 18:32:00,5865,"FROM CONSUMER REPORTS.......  Road TestSport V6 The redesigned Liberty scores worse than its predecessor and is the lowest-rated vehicle in its category. Its ride is unsettled, handling is clumsy, and the noisy engine guzzles gas. Its cramped interior is uncomfortable and sloppily finished. The Liberty, based on the low-scoring Dodge Nitro, at least can tow and tackle tough off-road terrain.  The Driving Experience The Liberty rocks from side to side over bumps. The ride often feels buoyant and unsettled, and at low speeds it can be stiff and snappy. On the highway the ride is more tolerable, but wind noise is excessive. Handling is ponderous, with pronounced body lean and vague steering that offers little feedback. On the track, the Jeep tends to plow ahead prematurely in turns. That compromised performance in our avoidance maneuver. Jeep claims to have retuned the suspension for improved handling and steering.  Acceleration from the hoarse-sounding, 210-horsepower, 3.7-liter, V6 engine feels sluggish at times and delivers just 16 mpg overall. It towed our 3,500-pound test trailer from 0 to 60 in a leisurely 21.1 seconds. The four-speed automatic transmission is not very responsive or refined. Our Liberty has the optional full-time four-wheel-drive system, which is helpful in winter driving. The Liberty can tackle off-road situations well enough. In our braking tests, stops were long in wet and dry conditions. The headlights had good distance and intensity. The high beams added no intensity over low beams but had slightly more distance.  This dog wouldn't be my first pick....."
485037,John,2010-07-13 19:28:00,2956," I was thinking pretty much the same thing. They disappear off dealers lots pretty quick. They may not be the best ride or fit and finish of the bunch but they do the job and can tow 5,000# no prob. They are choppy on the highway, but so are most SWB trucks/SUV's.  I too can get from Burlington to Lakair on one tank in a 2010 Jeep GC V8 with a 3,000 boat, motor and trailer also loaded with gear. So your 13.0L/C KM 4 Runner is nothing special.  And by the way, yes the GC 3.0 diesel is a nice truck, try finding one without getting hosed!"
485039,John,2010-07-13 19:33:00,2956," Blow and whistle all you want Billy Bob, BUT, the Consumer Reports Bible Bashers are not the Holy Grail some of us seem to think. Pay attention, I was talking CRD... Yes it is not the most comfortable, nor best finished, or best ride in the pack but value for money on the used market it is pretty darn good!"

My rig loaded is around 2600lbs and it runs around 2000rpms at about 110kmph.  It is awesome offroad and blazed many a trail on Lake Winnipeg this winter, my only complaint is it didn't have enough weight to pull out the new f150s that were getting stuck. I can house up to 7'6 rods by running them up from the floor of the passenger seat, 8 footers are relegated to the boat."
485112,Billy Bob,2010-07-13 22:55:00,5865," Hey, I don't write the reviews but I would rather judge by a NON-BIAS person then someone telling me to purchase ""their"" vehicle....so here's one for comparison...BTW I don't own a SUV...  FROM CONSUMER REPORTS: Among conventional, full-frame SUVs, the Toyota 4Runner is a good choice. It corners relatively well and its suspension suppresses most bumps. The cabin is quiet, and the brakes work well. The 3.4-liter V6 is lively and relatively economical. The standard 4WD setup is a part time system. The V6, stability control, and full-time 4WD became standard in 2001. The 2003 redesign made the 4Runner our top-rated SUV in its class that is suited for serious off-roading. It offers a V6 or V8 engine as well as a small third-row seat. Fuel economy is unimpressive, but reliability is exceptional. The V6 got a five-speed automatic for 2005, and the V8 received more horsepower."
485129,LipDip,2010-07-13 23:44:00,39,"The realities, as I see them:  1. You live, work and commute in the city. This is where the bulk of your driving takes place.  2. 400-800km round trips?? You been fishing the Amazon all those wknd and not told anybody? Round trips of 400 is being pretty generous, and those are usually easy miles, on the 400/69 Towing....  3. ....a boat, motor and trailer that weighs basically nothing. It's got a plastic 5gal tank. You can easily not even have to trailer it with fuel.  If you were looking at buying a 19' Ranger or big ProV and were going to be doing a PILE OF TRAVEL, you'd be smart to buy a V8. You make maybe one or two monthly drives towing a tiny rig that weighs nothing. Towed my 17' Lund all over hell's half acre with a Jimmy, upgraded at 300,000. Tow it now with a 6 banger Explorer. My Dad and I put close to 700,000 kms on his  6 banger Explorer towing tandem axle trailer loads of rock, green wood in 8' lengths, sand, topsoil. And oh yes...a 17' Boston Whaler every wknd from Port Credit to Point au Baril. 300kms every week like clock work for over a decade. Hard, hard miles. If you think your boat stresses a regular 6 cyl pick-up or SUV to the point of burning more gas or working the tranny/motor excessively, I think you're wrong. That's just my opinion. All I can give you is perspective from a lifetime of personal experience. Not Consumers Digest, not websites, just what I've seen in real life. What you're towing, how often you tow, the distances, and where you do all your non-towing driving (the bulk of your driving, as it turns out) just don't add up to needing a v8. Unless you're making Caesars. In which case, I'll take ten!"
485185,Banger68,2010-07-14 02:11:00,157, It has been very reliable and is at 350K kms now. There have been electrical gremlins (blend door and a couple switches) but nothing that made it unusable. The best I can get is about 22 mpg. Usually averages around 17 mpg. I believe the newer 4.7 version is a bit better on gas ... but not alot. It is a very capable vehicle and I have never been stuck

My little 2.5l engine makes as much power as most V-8's anyways. I have no problem towing my rig (which is bigger than yours, and heavier) with the forester. The only time I feel it on there is if there is gale force cross winds.Hills don't even make it grunt!! Trust me when I say I put on A LOT of miles towing my trailer around. The only problems I've had are with the trailer itself.....never the tow vehicle. I've even towed a 17ft princecraft w/ 90 with the forester. No problem.......it was almost 3000lbs. I wouldn't tow it a long distance, but 50km was a breeze.  I'm not saying to go buy a subaru, just saying you don't need anything heavy duty to tow your little aluminum around. Especially where you live. I live in the country and put on a lot of miles, so the V-8 days are done!! I've put 56K on mine in less than a year..........just sayin. I've put 160,ooo on the forester with absolutely no issues at all. Oil changes, brakes, tires and a reccomended timing chain replacement since new.

Gas mileage, believe it or not, was better with the V8 but RPM's and towing/pulling out of the launch are very similar. If towing with the Explorer do not tow with the Overdrive engaged!

After todays ride home from the lake I'm sick and tired of   that are pulling pontoon boats with Honda CRV's and stock mirrors! IDIOTS !

484618,Fang,2010-07-12 13:36:00,1330,"I'll put up a vote for the Ford Explorer. I've had my Expedition for 6 years now and it's a beast. I pull a 17.5 Crestliner and have had up to a 24' Sylvan behind her and you'd hardly know you have anything on the hitch. My buddy hauls a big family camper all over ontario in his Explorer V6. This was my first Ford and I was nervous about the reputation on Ford. Little did I know that on the truck side they make a darn good product. I went straight to my 2 mechanics that I've been dealing with for years and they had very high praise for reliability and low cost of repairs.  Direct quote from the guy who does my oil changes - You can't hurt a ford truck  In 6 years, here's my service history regular oil and transmission checks/service ONE complete brake job and getting close to probably a second 2 sets of tires some electrical bugs on the security system 1 12V plug that doesn't work anymore ( I probably could fix that)  210,000 km and going strong  Only drawback - They like stopping at gas stations"

I also tow my utility trailer with it. Custom built (by me) 5.5 x 10ft. with a 3500lb axle. Dang trailer probably weighs over 1000lbs. empty. Never a problem towing.  My lease is up in November and I'm looking for either another Escape or similar sized SUV. Quite a few people I know have Ford F150 pickups and swear by them. That's another option. I like the 5 door (4 door + tailgate) model.  Jeep Grand Cherokees used to come with a diesel engine. Something to consider if you want used 4x4, need lots of torque & still get decent fuel economy.  Good luck !!!"
484664,Governator,2010-07-12 16:13:00,879,I've also been looking at suvs/crossovers for a while now.  We only have a Pontiac G6 and the Xterra is exactly what we've been looking at.  I don't have a boat or a camper (yet) but plan to have one of the two in the next 2 years so I need one to pull it and fit all my kids crap in the back lol.  We have a 10 month old and I'm glad everyone here has confirmed my thoughts on it.  Thanks!
483506,Raf,2010-07-08 19:08:00,3495,"I currently own/tow with a Jeep Cherokee and am starting to look at replacing it. 4x4 is a must. Boat, motor & trailer I'd estimate at around 1000lbs so it's not a big load.  Vehicles I am considering are early-mid 2000s model years:  Another Cherokee Grand Cherokee w/V8 - I think the I6 is underpowered for the GC. Chev/GM Jimmy Ford Explorer  I am not too familiar with the import offerings (pathfinder/4runner - i don't think honda has anything -- CRV is too small)  edit: thansk for the help, got a Grand Cherokee"

483510,JohnF,2010-07-08 19:17:00,3494, I agree. I think my Pilot had more power than my Flex does and it hauls Garry2rs Ranger just fine.  I noticed a guy pulling a bassboat one a single axle (so presumably in the 17' range) with no apparent diffculty using a Ford Escape and another guy pulling a bassboat about that size with a RAV4.

483512,Raf,2010-07-08 19:20:00,3495,"I'll have a closer look at the Pilot.  The RAV4 and Escape are too small and I'd be afraid to take them off pavement.  As well, capable of towing does not always equal a good choice for towing."
483513,SBCregal,2010-07-08 19:25:00,688,have you considered a crew/quad cab pickup? any 1/2 ton would be more than enough truck and probably a little more capable offroad than most suvs

The Xterra is one of the few SUVs thats not a glorified station wagon. Full frame, solid rear axle. 170,000 Kms and still drives like new, 4 wheel dics brakes are nice for stopping too!

The 06's were a model change and have some issues, make sure the transmission is in good shape and you'll be ok.  07 models are very nice and improved upon, but not that easy to find for 20grand or less.  Honda or Toyota, you're either looking or at least 5grand more, or a year or 2 older than the simular Ford or GM vehilce."

483710,SylvanOwner,2010-07-09 12:52:00,266,"I'll add another vote for the XTerra.  I have an '02 that I bought only a couple months ago but absolutely love it so far.  I tow a 14' tinny full floor with 25hp so it's pretty light but you don't even know it's there.  Mine is a 5-speed, 3.3L V6 without the supercharger, not the gutsiest vehicle out there but...the supercharged version requires premium gas.  I get close to 500km per 60L tank with or without the boat and have 150 000km on it - doesn't burn a spot of oil.  The manuals are rated for 3500lbs., the autos for 5000lbs. - go figure??  The timing belts need to be done at around 160k (I think), I did mine right when I got it and that and the water pump and thermostat cost $900 so definitely be aware of that issue with whatever vehicle you buy if it's a belt and not a chain."
483720,Raf,2010-07-09 13:12:00,3495,"Thanks for the input fellas.  You've given me some things to think about.  As much as I miss driving a turbocharged vehicle, I'm not keen on running premium in a truck so any of the forced induction vehicles (SC Xterra or the turbo Subaru) are propably out.  A Hemi powered Grand Cherokee would be nice..  My Cherokee is one of those 4.0L I6 motors with 400,000kms. Owned it since about 200k and other than maintenance and a power steering pump that went out, never had any issues with it.  It has not had any easy life, that's for sure.  It's more than capable off-road for my needs and pulls the boat just fine.   The motor is bulletproof, has enough power but, the body is starting to show its age.  My only complaint is when towing (I do not tow in OD) the RPMs are up there at 95-100km/hr due to the gearing.  As far as SUV vs Pick-up, that's another one I'll have to ponder. I think I would miss having the ability to crash in the back and indoor storage.  Also, how the heck do you guys fit an 8'+ rod in the bed of one of these smaller pickups?  I can fit an 8'6"" rod in the Cherokee along the ceiling. I know it can go in the boat but I need to get to my boat."
