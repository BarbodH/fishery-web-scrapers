506039,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-23 15:38:00,2690,One per angler for most of the Bay...two once you go past the Glenora Ferry.
506040,west lake charlie,2010-09-23 15:38:00,40,Its 2 rods East of the Glenora Ferry Crossing  Out to Lake Ontario Good luck man. Let us know how you do.
506047,kickingfrog,2010-09-23 15:54:00,8333,The two rods only applies if you are on the water as well. So if you are shore fishing past the ferry it is still one rod. Or so that is what I understand.

506153,torco,2010-09-23 20:19:00,656,"Thanks guys, we'll be in Hay Bay for the most part so now we know 1 rod each. Looking forward to it, haven't fished for walleye in a few years. Will put up a report upon my return."
506195,Stoty,2010-09-23 22:23:00,2910, Same here man! It's going to be another AWESOME ice season! You coming out with us again?
