Many anglers still practice out of here for the BPS Open ... and it's a popular spot for recreational bass anglers and those chasing perch as well. I wanted to be sure to give all a heads up so you can plan your fall fishing accordingly. There really is no ideal time to get this done .. low water levels are best from a work perspective though.  The following notice has been prepared:  Wil  Attention Lake Simcoe Anglers and Boaters:  Please be advised that the boat launch area at Sibbald Point Provincial Park on Lake Simcoe near Sutton ON will be closed for maintenance from Oct 4th to Oct 31st 2010.  During this time no boats will be permitted to launch at the park. We regret the inconvenience this may cause but are certain the improved launching facilities will be a welcome improvement for all who like to launch at Sibbald Point Provincial Park.  Thank you for your understanding.  Greg Walsh, Park Superintendent Sibbald Point Provincial Park"
506169,Flappn,2010-09-23 20:56:00,245,Do they charge $25 bucks to launch there like at Innisfil? If they do it will prb go up after the repairs. What a joke $25 bucks to launch...what have we come to.....
506255,Sinker,2010-09-24 00:23:00,8692,"I don't think the price will go up. Its a provincial park, and all parks charge the same to launch. The improvements will be nice though, its a great launch as it is.  S."
