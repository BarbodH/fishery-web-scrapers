505858,danbouck,2010-09-23 00:23:00,4380,For a lot less you can get a nice jon boat

505945,HTHM,2010-09-23 03:27:00,4082,I have a nice 14' with a 20hp Johnson you can have for ~2500 with a bow mount trolling motor. On a trailer as well.
505974,Lunker777,2010-09-23 12:21:00,866,For that price?!?!?! I would find a good Aluminum before buying a plastic boat from Canadian Tire. Just sayin....
506023,fishnsled,2010-09-23 14:32:00,3520,"I've always liked those plastic boats.  They do seem to have everything on them (depending on the model).  Livewell, wiring for trolling motor and lights, storage, etc.  But for the price of them I've stayed away from them and also just went for a bigger boat.  For the money I'd be looking at a tinny."
506151,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-23 20:16:00,1107,I think for a secondary boat for some smaller lakes/no gas motor these would be ideal but as your only boat I would def look for a 14'tinner you will be able to fish alot more.
506168,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-23 20:55:00,0,"i'm going to agree with the majority and say for that money, you could get something much more practical.  a used 12' tinner and a 9.9 would be just as mobile for transport, but far more mobile on the water.  it would also be more comfortable.  i'm not sure how tall you are, but at 6'3 i found these boats real tough to fish in for a day."
506174,misfish,2010-09-23 21:15:00,29133,"I seen that boat/raft, up here at the CTC.Like mentioned,you can do much better.  Piece of crap IMO."
506177,whynotalen,2010-09-23 21:27:00,33,"Hello again,  thanks so much for your advice. I think you are all right. I went on Kijiji and found many nice complete boats with trailers and everything for $2000 and less. Now I just need to take my time and wait for a REALLY good deal.....lots of time till next summer."
506189,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-23 22:04:00,0,good hunting.
506242,pikehunter,2010-09-24 00:04:00,1659,"Saw those at Crappy Tire in Stoney Creek. My thoughts were, ""Pretty neat, and Holly $&!t look at the price!"""
