Then I saw a cottonmouth with a frog in his mouth, and frogs are good bass bait. Knowing the snake couldn't bite me with the frog in his mouth, I grabbed him right behind the head, took the frog and put it in my bait bucket.  Now the dilemma was how to release the snake without getting bitten. I grabbed my bottle of Jack Daniel's and poured a little whiskey in Its mouth. His eyes rolled back, he went limp! I released him into the lake without incident and carried on with my fishing, using the frog as bait.  A little later, I felt a nudge on my foot. There was that damn snake with two frogs in his mouth!    Art"
