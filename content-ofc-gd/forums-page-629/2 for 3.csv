My first thought was I would much rather spend a September Saturday small stream trout fishing than looking at houses that I can't afford.  Get home, check OFC, see MJL's post with his trout and make-up my mind to go fishing a soon as posible. I have two hours after work on Monday afternoon before I have to pick-up my son from daycare. Everthing is preped the night before, and I am out the door before 2pm and back writing this by 4:40pm.  First fish is a bow, the cork is 8 inches long    After the bow I thought that I might have a chance to get a triple play: rainbow, brown trout and brook trout.  Next was a small brown   Now the heat is on. I have a only a short amount of time before I've got to pick-up Ryan.  Got another rainbow, smaller than the first (no photo)  Got a wopper on, in my mind I had my triple and maybe one of the best brookies of my life. It of course came off. My heart says that it was a brookie, my mind says it was a brown or a bow. I'm going to try to sneak out again to try to find out.    Stay tuned."
505352,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-20 21:05:00,0,Very nice! Did you catch them drifting flies?
505373,MJL,2010-09-20 22:46:00,2427,Nice fish!  Funny you should mention me.  Perhaps the only reason I actually got started on fishing for resident fish was seeing Ehg landing piles of beautiful brookies and looking at pics Wallacio posted of several gorgeous browns here on OFC - OFC has also been the catalyst for other forays into other types of fishing for me too (like ice fishing). Stream fishing for trout is addictive to the max!  I'm itching to get out to the streams again.

505380,Harrison,2010-09-20 23:00:00,2202," Nice fish kickingfrog  Very True MJL, it was posts from Ehg and others that got me on the head water browns.  Unfortunatley I recently snapped the tip to my fav ultralite Mitchell Zero gravity rod (anyone has one I will gladly buy it).  I'll be back it until the creeks start to freeze, or at least the angler do, then it's steel time."
505391,Grimace,2010-09-20 23:38:00,2020,"Nice fish.  I love this time of year, you can run around in the day without getting scorched by the sun."
505428,Leecher,2010-09-21 01:06:00,7832,Ataboy Rob A well spent couple hours along the stream for sure.....  too bad about the one that got away    sounds like it was a biggun Thanks for sharing Jacques
505499,frozen-fire,2010-09-21 14:06:00,542,Nice! I'm sure it was a brookie that you lost that would've completed that triple play!
505546,kickingfrog,2010-09-21 19:44:00,8333,"  The two rainbows and the lost fish hit a #4 panther martin (gold blade, black with yellow spots), the brown was caught on that small jig that is in its mouth."
505833,Spiel,2010-09-22 23:27:00,9065,You may have missed the hat trick Rob but I'd be happy with those results 10 Sundays a month.
505852,ctranter,2010-09-23 00:13:00,543,"Oh no another STI infection! Salmo Trutta-Itis must be going around this time of year.  I know how you feel about losing that biggie.  I was out with my buddy a few days ago and he saw a big brookie under a log that was rising for his fly, but not commiting.  He changed up his presentation, addressing every subtylety imaginable when *SLURP*, the 15""+ brookie takes the fly and the fight was on.  The little 5 weight midget rod was doubled over, he gets the fish 3 feet from shore, it starts rolling and  ""as mysteriously as it appeared.... it was gone""  For both of us, all we can think about is a gorgeous 1-2lb brookie in full fall colours swimming away, talk about planting an addictive seed!  Thanks for the report and pics!"
