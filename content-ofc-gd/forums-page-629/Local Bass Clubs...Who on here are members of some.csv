506178,whynotalen,2010-09-23 21:34:00,33,"Hey All,  in the past year I have become very serious about fishing. I been learning as much as I can and buying equipment like crazy. hence looking for a boat eventually (as seen in my other discussion question). I still suck at fishing but I love it.  I been reading lots online and came about the BASS masters organization and found that there tons of local clubs in Ontario. I decided that i will join my local Bassmasters club in the coming year to become a better fisher and to meet more people who share me new passion, and meanwhile have subscribed to Bassmasters Online/Magazine.  Well, yesterday I also noticed that the FLW has the Fed Nation with also a few clubs in Ontario ( not as many as BASS) but I did notice that JP DeRose was the President of one.  My Question, are you part of a BASS Club? Which one? How do you like it? Do you recommend one over the other? Maybe you are part of both?"

CBAF being the new one of the two, but the CBAF has grown to pretty much be the second largest bass circuit in Ontario, that is all angler driven.  If he/she is a top angler in the province I ll be that they belong to the CBAF, no politics, no hassles and for a 100 or so you are pretty much guaranteed to get into a 50k bass boat and fish with some of the bess bass guys in the province, no 8 boat tournaments here, seymour say close to 50 last weekend. PM if you want more info"
506319,steverowbotham,2010-09-24 12:12:00,1800,I've been a part of the Barrie Bassmasters B.A.S.S. chapter since 2001 and I dont have any complaints
506327,Bob Devine,2010-09-24 12:46:00,251,"Clubs are a great place to learn whether it is for walleye, musky, bass or trout/salmon. There are no clubs(bass) here in SW Ont(Windsor) but I have done a number of seminars in Michigan for walleye and trout. I am amazed at the size and the involvement these people have dedicated to their respective organizations. Some of the clubs exceed 400 members.. WOW!! Now you know when politicians try to pull something over there(USA)these groups get involved and have their say before it becomes a law. Many updates on stocking programs and always youth activities to teach them right. Good luck with your search for a club, I know you will enjoy it and learn."
506386,LucG,2010-09-24 15:27:00,779,I'm a member of the North Bay Bassmasters. Fished my first year this summer as a non-boater. Was great! I learned a lot! Was even lucky enough to have a couple 1st place finishes.
