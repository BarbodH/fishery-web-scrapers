506190,fish_finder,2010-09-23 22:06:00,370,"Managed to get out last weekend with a couple of buddies in GB.  We hit three rivers, each one was a treat.  Saw a few large fish, but no hookups with the bigger fellas.  The best fish was a 15 inch resident bow, and I'm not complaining about that!!  Nearly all fish were taken on dries, we hit a couple of pretty thick BWO hatches both days, with some larger drakes in the mix as well.  Some pics of the feesh.....                                The big ole Bow! "

506200,fish_finder,2010-09-23 22:29:00,370, Yes dude!! you do!!  They're pretty aggressive right now.
506247,Leecher,2010-09-24 00:12:00,7832,Awesome report and pics fish_finder Love those close up shots Thanks for sharing Leechman
506302,sauce,2010-09-24 06:47:00,219,Nice! Thanks for reminding me how spoiled I am. I haven't been out to fish the creeks in my area for a while now. Strictly rivers for bass n eyes (which has been good). Only a week left now to hit some local trout. I really should give it a try...
506303,sneak_e_pete,2010-09-24 07:06:00,540,When I see pics like that I wish I was a trout fisherman....they are so beautiful...great job.

506348,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-24 13:40:00,932,"Great report as always FF  I made my first trip out for trout last night (since the spring) and had a great night - 4 in 1.5 hours including a beautiful brown in fall colours (17"").  I think I'll dedicate this next week to trout for sure.  Cheers, Ryan"
