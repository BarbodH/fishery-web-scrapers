505520,LucG,2010-09-21 16:36:00,779,I would do it in a second! I think I'd even pay for it  Prob just as good as any roller coaster I've ridden.
505523,Lunker777,2010-09-21 17:05:00,866,I think the second Gymkhana is WAYYYYYYY better then the third !  Kenny B is an amazing driver though !!! no doubt about it !
505524,SlowPoke,2010-09-21 17:11:00,2984,I'd pay even more to DRIVE his car!

505528,Terry,2010-09-21 17:24:00,14456,people say that reminds them of me driving home on a typical friday night....  really   LOL
505530,NAW,2010-09-21 17:35:00,4022,"For sure, Ken's a wicked driver.  I met him at tallpines a few years back.  L'Estage is my fav rally drive though.."

505544,EC1,2010-09-21 19:35:00,930,This one is much better than the last one. There were too many gimmicks like breaking paintballs and crushing fluoresecent lights in the last one. Only thing is I rather him drive the subaru.
505555,BUSTER,2010-09-21 20:55:00,1336,I thought you said Ken BRock like the reporter from simpsons
505575,Bigfisherman,2010-09-21 21:56:00,100,Makes me want to start up my 700rwhp ride....maybe I will....
505624,BillM,2010-09-22 01:36:00,17367,"It's to bad Ken Block couldn't win a race to save his life, lol."
505702,Lunker777,2010-09-22 12:02:00,866, Are you kidding me ?? That is the best one ! The effects in HD are awesome !!!! IMO there was alot more driving too... regardless Ken Block is crazy awesome !
505712,frozen-fire,2010-09-22 13:39:00,542,Better when he was driving a Subaru haha
505883,GBW,2010-09-23 01:20:00,8460,my 2006 doesn't sound and or look like that...  I need to make some mod's I guess then
