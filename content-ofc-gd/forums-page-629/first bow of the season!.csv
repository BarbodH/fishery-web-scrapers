505460,fishinguypat,2010-09-21 04:05:00,547,seems pretty dark... from a superior trib i presume?
505462,Eazy,2010-09-21 04:24:00,260,"For sure, I was almost wondering if it was a resident?"
505478,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-21 12:18:00,0,Very nice. It almost looks like a Chinook. Nice little stream there. It must be loaded with trout.
505491,perchslayer666,2010-09-21 13:34:00,280,Nice boot.
505492,Rod Caster,2010-09-21 13:35:00,5784,Nice fish and good start to the bow season. I'm itchy all of a sudden:dunno:
505567,Eazy,2010-09-21 21:41:00,260,"Actually, not much more than a 100 yards or so down river, it's pretty deep and slow,and also full of toothy critters, which love to feed on fingerlings!"
505849,cjgraham,2010-09-23 00:12:00,104,I caught a few bows there way back in the day mid summer. I would assume resident being the color. Good first fish! can't wait to get home and join ya!
505949,BillM,2010-09-23 04:03:00,17367,  You're blind if you think that's a chinook.
505956,wuchikubo,2010-09-23 08:27:00,1114,Nice long and dark bow!
