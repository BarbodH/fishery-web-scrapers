I have a couple of spots that I am considering, including Strawberry Point lookout,  the Bracebridge Resource management Centre or Wilson's Falls. We might even hike two trails in they are short. We're going up for the day. I would like a scenic hike with moderate difficulty. Colours are a must!  I would greatly appreciate any help!!  Thanks folks!"

506460,Mattitude,2010-09-24 18:50:00,155,+1 for Torrance Barrens.  Really unique spot with areas that resemble the tundra of the Artic.  Should be a good spot for fall colours too.
