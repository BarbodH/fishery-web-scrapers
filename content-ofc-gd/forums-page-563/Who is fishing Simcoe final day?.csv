561580,Skud,2011-03-14 11:22:00,739,I am thinking of playing hooky from work tomorrow. I have yet to catch a fish through the ice this season on Simcoe. Only went out once though.  May go out from the 9th line of Oro. Anybody heading out?
561789,Skud,2011-03-14 21:39:00,739,Nobody going out?
561799,Terry,2011-03-14 22:00:00,14456,I wish I could
561815,Cudz,2011-03-14 22:26:00,2652,I was out today. might try again tomorrow if my wife gives me a pass (doubtful)
561817,misfish,2011-03-14 22:31:00,29133,"    Doug Im thinking real hard about it,but that would blow my OT at work."
561928,young_one,2011-03-15 02:55:00,620,"Out in the AM 7th line, 95 FOW Good luck tomorrow!"
561937,Skud,2011-03-15 03:19:00,739,I will still be heading to 9th line. Some did well in the 70-80 fow range for Lakers today. I am on foot so the 1+ km walk will warm me up. If the fishing is slow I am going to run and gun(on foot) towards the 7th line. Tight lines.
561976,Skud,2011-03-15 12:50:00,739,Out here off of the 7th. A few chasers but no hook ups yet
561994,Cudz,2011-03-15 13:55:00,2652,Was at the 6th yesterday and it never heated up until about 11 am.  Stay on it.  I was in 85' when I finally got some action.
562028,Skud,2011-03-15 16:26:00,739,"One trout, two whiteys and a herring so far. I will get my limit yet"
562154,Skud,2011-03-15 22:37:00,739,Still out here like a shmuck. Have two nice lakers and one whitey in the sled.  Just trying to close the deal
562155,misfish,2011-03-15 22:40:00,29133, Not what you said earlier?LOL
562156,irishfield,2011-03-15 22:40:00,26272,LOL Doug.. be sure to point the sled at the shoreline! Gonna be dark soon...
562206,Skud,2011-03-16 01:14:00,739,All finished up and at home. Landed two trout and two whiteys. Put one whitey back because it needs to grow a little bigger. I also thought I would catch another to get my limit but the afternoon was not good to me. Lots of lookers and a few hits that I messed up. I also caught myself a great sunburn on my face. Red lobster!  The trout both hit a lipless crank 40 feet off bottom and the whiteys were both caught on a Meegs on bottom. Maybe next year I will get out more then once. Here are the pics  Early morning    End of the day 
562220,Cudz,2011-03-16 01:35:00,2652,nice!!!
562257,johnnyb,2011-03-16 03:09:00,3413,You went the distance....and have some gorgeous fish and pics to show for it.  Sorry about the face though
562259,Rod Caster,2011-03-16 03:16:00,5784,That sunrise photo is matched only by the three fish combo shot.
