561945,skeeter,2011-03-15 04:11:00,1907,"Took my son Daniel out for our last trip out in the hut. He caught his first jumbo perch on Sunday. Needless to say he was one happy camper about that, and of course he kept reminding me that HE has the biggest fish. So today we are givin it and fishing hard, i decide to change up lures and pull out another rod and put on a fluttering eye dropper. Then Daniels says, well dad since your not using your lucky mini tube jig, can i use it? Not 20 minutes later he's yelling "" Dad get the gaff i got a white fish"". I look over and i see my ultra lite with 2LB test on it bent over like a twisted pretzel. Before i could say anything, the head comes up into the hole and he hoists it right up and out The 2LB test line snaps and the fish hits the floor of the hut, and before it flops he's on it like a hobo on a spam sandwich. He grabs it and holds it up, now i have to give him the bad news. It's not a white fish. But he was so pumped he didnt care.    At 15"" he has the biggest fish, he won. Now the hut is back in storage. The drive home from the lake was a sad one cause the weekend getaway is done. But the ending was the best part of the season with Daniel !!"

562483,Live2fish85,2011-03-16 19:48:00,1633,Hey it's to bad that it was your last for the year but nothing like ending it with your son. I don't know the feeling from your side since my girls 15 months but I do know that some of my best memories were my grandfather and my musky trips.
