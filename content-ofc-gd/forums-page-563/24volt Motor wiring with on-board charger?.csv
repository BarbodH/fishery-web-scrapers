562237,Pigeontroller,2011-03-16 02:23:00,2793,I'd like some advise. I have a new 24v Minn Kota and a 2 bank on-board charger. I understand the proper way to wire the two batteries to achieve 24 volts. Do you simply put the two (x4) connections from the charger on the two batteries? I know it seems like a stupid question but it sure seems like alot of wires!

Makes you scratch your head considering there is now a postive and a negative charging wire side by side.. connected together by that big battery cable between the batteries.. but I assure you it will work just fine."
