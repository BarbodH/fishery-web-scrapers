562370,bigugli,2011-03-16 14:14:00,6138,"Any man made structure is going to require permission. Rock piles, cribs, Christmas tree piles, have all been used in the past. If caught creating artificial habitat without the required permits, you bear the the cost of removal and restoration. It ain't cheap."
562372,jimmer,2011-03-16 14:21:00,2730,I agree with Sinclair.
562387,craigdritchie,2011-03-16 15:08:00,1586,"Biggest problem is that it's considered a hazard to navigation (and in a shallow lake like Scugog, it really would be). The fine would be steep, over and above previously mentioned removal costs.  Why in Scugog? Sinclair's bang on - the lake has more than enough stuff in it already.  Artificial habitat is big in some parts of the US, especially where they create man-made lakes out of old strip pit mines. Those have zero weed growth or any other kind of natural habitat - they're basically like swimming pools."
562390,Harrison,2011-03-16 15:20:00,2202,"As Craig touched on, in the states they create brush piles in structure vacant waterways to attrach and hold fish.  Kind of like us walking into a huge emtpy room and there is one chair in the middle, where are you going to go?  I have ""heard of"" certain folks who do something like this on Simcoe.  Except they use pantyhose and stuff them with bacon or tuna and a rock to bait areas for smallmouth.  Not so much structure, but still illegal I believe. Only hearsy however."
