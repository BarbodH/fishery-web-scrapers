Took me a few seconds to do.. thought I would share it with you all.  Please see below.   This is a letter writing campaign to Canada Post asking them to create a stamp to honour the 10,000 kids living with cancer in Canada.  Obviously, this is close to our hearts as we've watched our 9 year old son battle cancer for 7 years now.  He is truly a hero.  The website is www.goldribboncampaign.org  This campaign was started by a 16 year old, three time brain tumour survivor and her 2 sisters.  You can pull up the letter and email it back to them and they will forward it to Canada Post.  Please pass it on."
