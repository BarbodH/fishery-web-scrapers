Managed 4 trout and 6 whites from 8-12 in the am.  Missed a few others.  A small Williams snagged the first fish so I put on a Lil’Foxee Jigging Minnow – looks like a Meggs (perch coloured then a white one).  Tipped it with the tail-end of a Gulp minnow. Fished on bottom: small lifts with the occasional high lift of the lure.   Good way to end on Simcoe. The fog rolled in around 9 and stayed until I left.  Lake trout were full of smelt. Ice was great.  Already looking forward to next year.  Now on to rivers and bows. Cheers"

562209,Skud,2011-03-16 01:18:00,739,Did better than I.  Maybe I moved around too much. Good stuff
