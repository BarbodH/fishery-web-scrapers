562374,irishfield,2011-03-16 14:21:00,26272,Oh Dan... if you want a good steak diner.. shuffle across to Houstons at Front and Young. In the North end of the building on the N/E corner of the intersection... Make someone else pay..
562039,danc,2011-03-15 17:04:00,4677,"After returning home from Red Lake last night, I thoroughly enjoyed sleeping in today for the first time in two weeks. But things got even better when I got up today. A package was delivered to me from Dewalt. I had a feeling what was inside before I opened it, and I was right. It was my autographed Phaneuf jersey. Man, is it nice!!        There was another unexpected surprise inside the box as well.    So this is the first part of my contest win. I'll be flying to Toronto Friday, spending three nights at the Royal York, wearing my Phaneuf jersey to the Bruins game Saturday night, having drinks and wings with the nice folks from Dewalt at Real Sports before the game, meeting with Phaneuf at the ACC after the game, and flying home Monday.  Now I have a question for anyone that can answer. Can I bring a camera to the game and take pictures while I'm there? Or is there some sort of copyright law against this? I plan on bringing an slr with a big 70-300mm lens, so this is not something that I can hide in my back pocket. I wouldn't want to be turned back at the door with this hanging around my neck. Thanks.."
562045,Fang,2011-03-15 17:16:00,1330,I've had my camera in there a few times. never have been stopped or asked about it. Just walked in carrying it in plain view. If there is a stipulation about cameras or recording devices it would be printed on your tickets
562046,SmokestackLightnin,2011-03-15 17:17:00,390,"Still images at Leaf games are OK, no video allowed.  "
562047,cwpowell,2011-03-15 17:17:00,265,Shouldn't be a problem to take pics.
562057,CCMAR,2011-03-15 17:37:00,11,I was at a game not long ago snapping shots... it's fine as long as its not continuous is what i was told!!  
562061,TJQ,2011-03-15 17:51:00,7806,Thats awesome Dan!!
562063,irishfield,2011-03-15 18:01:00,26272,Great stuff Dan.. as we discussed.. at this point I'm still at home and hope I get to stay here. If that changes I'll let you know..
562065,Roy,2011-03-15 18:08:00,13728,"That's fantastic, Dan! They'll make a Leaf fan out of you yet. When you shake Phaneuf's hand an appropriate greeting could be ""So, I hear you're for sale!"""
562067,solopaddler,2011-03-15 18:15:00,8605,That's great Dan!  Nice signature on the jersey.  Looks like an angry monkey slashed at it with a sharpie.
562068,bucktail,2011-03-15 18:16:00,1857,Thats a great score!!!!
562082,brandon,2011-03-15 19:35:00,857,Awesome Dan!  And I believe the rules state that lenses used must not exceed 80mm in focal length.
562088,kickingfrog,2011-03-15 19:47:00,8333,"The short answer about the camera is: It depends.  A point and shoot digital is not likely to be a problem at all. Although you are not supposed to take video with it.  SLRs and DSLRs, and the lenses in particular are looked at with much more scrutiny. Because you are part of a promo you may have a better chance to get in with a DSLR  and long lens. The rep from the Leafs or the company involved in the promo should be able to help you with that. You'll get a special coloured band to put on you camera, or camera bag to say you're ""checked-out"" and good to go.  I have been to a couple of games as part of a special promo and went through this process. I have also gone to a game with a regular ticket and had my long lens put in a secure lock-up because it was deemed too long, but not every time . The security people, and then a MLSE rep when you complain, will tell you it is a league (NHL) policy, however when I've gone to Buffalo and Ottawa for games I've had no issues at all and have been told that it is the individual arenas to set the policy. In Buffalo the only thing I was told was that I was not allowed to use the Camera holes in the glass down in the corners that the pros use.  The choice is yours, but I say bring the big stuff and have a point and shoot has a back up.  Pregame warm-up from the penalty box November 2009      Toscala stops Ovie in the shoot-out for a Leafs win.   Leafs v Canucks October 2010 "
562095,danc,2011-03-15 20:09:00,4677,That is great information Brandon and Rob. I wouldn't feel too badly about having to put my lens in a secure lockup rather than being turned away at the door because of it. I have a nice little 40-150 lens thats not much bigger than my 14-42 that I can bring with me. I'll probably leave the 70-300 at the hotel. Thanks guys.
562097,misfish,2011-03-15 20:11:00,29133,Enjoy your day Dan.Im sure you will have a blast.
562102,kickingfrog,2011-03-15 20:20:00,8333,In Buffalo for Bill's games the policy (maybe NFL wide) is/was any lens under 5 or 6 inches was ok. The focal length didn't matter.

562107,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-15 20:23:00,2690,"Very nice!!  Too bad the jersey wasn't the old style Maple Leaf, but, still a nice score! Have fun on Saturday"
562110,Joey,2011-03-15 20:24:00,9122,"Awesome Dan, what a great day"
562133,darsky,2011-03-15 21:28:00,586,what happened to that big plan to meet at house of pancakes and have hordes of fans come in and ignore Dion in favor of Dan ???
562136,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-15 21:49:00,10439, Dion doesn't like pancakes!!!    :rofl2:
562141,danc,2011-03-15 22:07:00,4677," Leafs GM Brian Burke screwed me out of that. With the recent playoff run, he put a ""no public appearance"" ban on the entire team. Maybe he's an OFC'er?? Anyways, I'm supposed to meet with Dion after the game in the ACC somewhere instead of the public meeting."
562146,Roy,2011-03-15 22:15:00,13728, Wow! Sounds weird to me. I know you'll have a good time Dan.
562147,irishfield,2011-03-15 22:20:00,26272,I just hope he gets to order room service on someones tab Roy !
562256,camillj,2011-03-16 03:08:00,1988,"Fabulous !!! Have a great time Dan ... hope they kick butt ... Go LEAFS !!!! Make sure you bring your OFC cap so when they put you on TV we will all recognize ya  And yes, from what I know tons of the fans have cell phones with cameras going at all times ... I  think the issue (as has been pointed out) is more with gerat big bulky cameras."
562315,lew,2011-03-16 09:59:00,12766,"I don't watch hockey and have no idea who Phaneuf is Dan, but congrats on the win and it sounds like your gonna have a fun weekend.  And your definetely in for an eye opener heading from T-Bay to the Big Smoke and not necesarily in a good way"
