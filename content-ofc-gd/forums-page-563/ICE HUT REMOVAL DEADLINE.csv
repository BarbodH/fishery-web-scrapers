Midnight is the deadline for ice huts to be removed from Lake Simcoe. Each hut is supposed to be registered at the beginning of the season with the Ministry Of Natural Resources. If the ice huts arenâ€™t removed, they can cause environmental hazards as the ice melts and can cause debris to wash up on shore. Owners who fail to remove their huts could face a fine of 150 dollars up to a thousand dollars under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
