If so what is there that is open at this time of the year. If there is any fish open and you would like to give some advice on what to use that would be great but I also understand if not lol. But if I know what is in that area right now I can figure it out what to use on my own as well. Thanks a lot.  Chris"
562135,cuzza,2011-03-15 21:38:00,467,Looks like nothing is open - even pike has a different season in that area and it closes at the end of Feb  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001335.pdf
562176,Jacob,2011-03-16 00:17:00,186,"Carp, catfish and suckers, ""garbage fish"" as most people would call them.  I like to use boilies for carp, worms for suckers and suckers for catfish"
562188,uglyfish,2011-03-16 00:40:00,981,"Water will likely be still high and fast flowing through that area making any kind of fishing tough, if not impossible. Its a good area for smallies during the summer and fall, pike and walleye too. Takes some patience and scouting, but u can find quality fish."
562215,DundasSteelheader,2011-03-16 01:26:00,166,"If you drive up the river a bit to Caladonia, you can get steelhead just below the dam. Check the regs though I dont know if it is still open or if its closed."
562227,johndox,2011-03-16 02:01:00,54,river is real high and fast right now I would give it another week or so then its time for spring sucker fishing so you can cut it up and go spring catfishing!
