The host were great and very helpful. The cabins were nothing fancy but they were clean and warm. Their rental boats were brand new.  The weather and the fish were against us. It rained almost the whole time and the bite was sloooww. The six of us in 3 boats caught about 20 fish in three days. Mostly small pike, and little smallies. The good thing about the cold wet weather was there were no bugs.  The most successful pattern was a jig head tipped with a small piece of worm. Even then you had to work it really slow, dragging bottom with it. We also caught a couple of pike on a bronze worm harness with a single blade, trolled really slowly.  The highlight of the trip was the back lake trek. They have small boats with motors set up at a series of lakes back behind Heridage Lake. You drive your boat, dock it, hike over a short portage and hop in the next boat. You then repeat for the next lake. 3 boats and 4 lakes later we were in a secluded ""back"" lake called Wasaksina Lake. We took our time and fished our way back to the cottage. It rain on us the whole day but it was still a great experience.  The fishing may have been slow but I still did OK compared to my buddies, I took ""Biggest"" and ""Most"" on the trip!  Despite the weather it was a great trip. I blame the lake of fish on the weather and the time of year. I'd love to do it again only a little earlier in the season.  Here are some pics of the trip!  The biggest (longest) of the trip, 21"" pike.   My best smallie.   The only walleye of the trip!   It's a small one but still counted toward Most!    This one was a bit of a surprise. I saw the golden colour when it rolled near the boat and thought I had a nice walleye. Turned out to be a fat 18"" sucker! "

The concensus that the lake was pretty much fished out stopped my progress into the purchase.  LOL.. how time flies.. now that you pulled up the old thread.. it was 4 years ago I was asking."
562254,johnnyb,2011-03-16 03:04:00,3413,"Nicely done, Homer....were most of the fish caught on Wasaksina, or on Herridge?  I've been eyeing Wasaksina after a friend told me about a nice camping trip he took there."
562546,Homer Is King,2011-03-16 23:56:00,305,Thanks! We did do better on Wasaksina. About 40% of our fish came from there for only about 10% of our effort.
