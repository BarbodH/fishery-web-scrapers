558515,splashhopper,2011-03-05 21:14:00,2931,"A young girl hasn’t been found after she slipped into the icy waters of a creek near London, Ont. Saturday morning.  The girl, who is under the age of 10, was with two other girls her age when she fell into the water near Riverside Rd. and Mayfair Rd. in Middlesex County, said Ontario Provincial Police Const. Chris Hunter.  Police were called at about 10:40 a.m. and found the two other girls unhurt. There were no adults with the children, police said.  “We’re still piecing together the incident,” Hunter said, adding because of the girls’ age it’s taking sometime to find out what happened.  Police, canine units, fire department volunteers and ambulances are on scene. The OPP underwater search and rescue unit and helicopter are on their way while police search in the nearby waters and wooded areas.  Police are reminding people to stay clear of the river and its banks as they are extremely slippery and the water temperatures extremely cold.  There’s a mix of fast running water and ice in the river, Hunter said from the scene. She was unsure of the water’s temperature but it’s about 3C in the area.

558634,splashhopper,2011-03-06 02:25:00,2931,"The search for a missing little girl who fell in a swollen creek near Melbourne has been called off until Sunday.  Police, fire fighters and local residents spent Saturday searching for the young girl who is missing after falling into a creek behind her home.  OPP Con. Chris Hunter said the girl was with two with other girls when she fell in to Middleman’s Creek about 10:45 a.m. The other two girls went to get help and police were called from a nearby residence.  The OPP said their underwater search and recovery Unit searched the water until dark and are expected to continue Sunday mid-morning. There are also plans for a helicopter to be used in the search.  They said some of their efforts have been ""hampered by extremely cold and fast running water and ice conditions.""  The girl fell into the creek in a deep ravine area just behind her home on Riverview Road. The creek flows into the Thames River and was unusually high because of steady rain and melting snow.  “We are talking to other two girls, piecing together exactly how she fell in.” said Hunter.  Police are not disclosing the exact age of the missing girl but said she is less than 10.  Hunter said the banks of the creek were very slippery and the rushing water was extremely cold. Hunter said the water was about two metres deep.  A command post has been set up in a nearby house and an underwater rescue team from Orillia joined the search in the afternon.  Hunter said conditions around all waterways in the area are very dangerous.  Environment Canada said the London area received about 40mm of rain Saturday combined with temperatures up to 6 which quickly melted snow.  City road crews were forced to temporarily close several streets because of localized flooding from high water and blocked catchbasins.  The Thames River is flooding into low lying parkland in Harris, Gibbons and Thames Parks.  The City of London is urging residents to stay away from the banks and ice surfaces of these ponds as well as banks of rivers and streams.  The Upper Thames River Conservation Authority said flood control reservoirs at Wildwood, Pittock and Fanshawe are near capacity."

Kayla Maybee fell into the Thames River in Southwest Middlesex shortly before 11 a.m.  She was near the water with two friends when she slipped and fell.  Police say the girl's friends ran to a nearby house to get help.  Provincial police Constable Chris Hunter says the search is now in recovery mode because of how long it has been since she fell in.  The search resumes Monday morning.  “We'd like to keep some optimism ... but it has been a tremendous amount of time since she went into the water,” Hunter said.  “We want to find her and we're going to continue in that effort the best we can.”  The water was cold and fast-moving. Police say the weather conditions have since improved.  The water level is higher than usual due to Saturday's rainfall.  Authorities are warning the public to stay away from the river because its banks are slippery and the water is extremely cold.("

Hampered by rising water levels, police officially called off the search last week, but were still monitoring the water levels.  They were searching the banks and were able to recover her body after water levels in the swollen creek subsided.  “Today we were successful with reuniting her with her family and unfortunately, she was deceased,” said Middlesex OPP Const. Liz Melvin.  Her body was found on the north side of the creek, east of Mayfair Rd. about halfway between where she went disappeared into the creek and the road, said Melvin.  She was with two friends when she fell into the creek behind her rural home in Melbourne, southwest of London.  Last week, her family thanked everyone for their support.  Monday, OPP asked the family’s privacy be respected."
