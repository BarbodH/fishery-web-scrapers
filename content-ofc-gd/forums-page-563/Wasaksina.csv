We are looking to get into some smallies and walleye.  We will be in a canoe so it won't be the easiest to cover lots of water.  For this reason I was hoping that someone out there would be able to give a couple of pointers on fishing the lake.  I'm not looking for anything specific, just general pointers.  Thanks a bunch"

499883,mbrown,2010-08-30 18:24:00,9,There is a huge rock pile in the middle of the lake-marked with white jugs- you should not have to move.  mb
499890,johnnyb,2010-08-30 19:08:00,3413,I don't go fishing in a canoe without my drift sock anymore...that would be my only recommendation...having never been to that particular lake.  A place named Wasaksina sounds like the fishing won't be a problem  
499902,Homer Is King,2010-08-30 19:39:00,305,I'm heading there at the end of September. We're staying at Papa John's Place on Herridge Lake. Where are you guys staying?  We are also going to be fishing Iceland and Driftwood Lake as well.  Let me know how you do!!
500074,Gordon Bombay,2010-08-31 01:39:00,6, Awesome. Thanks.   We're just going to be camping on the lake. I'll let you know how it goes for sure.
