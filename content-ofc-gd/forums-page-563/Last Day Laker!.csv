562100,Cudz,2011-03-15 20:16:00,2652,"My wife gave me a pass for 2 hours this morning.  I must say that I probably didn't deserve to go but she is very understanding and cool. Anyway, Got out at 11:15 and had a fish on within 15 minutes.  Smaller laker on a Strke Zone swammer.  Then only chasers for the next 45 mins.  The fish were very active but not commiting to the bite. Change of lures and change of techniques resulted in 2 nice lakers with 15 mins of each other.  Both hit white tubes as I was burning them from the bottom.  The first laker came up from 70' when my lure was at about 30'.  Amazing how good their eyesight is.  It probably took it about 2 seconds to 40' up.  Crushed my lure 20' under the hole. Second bigger laker did the same but hit earlier, around the 50' mark.  Had a couple nice runs and goth tangled in my other line.  No probs just opened the bail on other rod and played it out. All the fish were released. Fun march out on the ice!  "
562101,Cudz,2011-03-15 20:18:00,2652,"On a side note, both fish appeared to be natural as I couldn't find any clipped fins.  Nice!"
562104,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-15 20:21:00,2690,"Nicely done!  Almost got the day off, but, things got way too busy"

562160,WeedLine,2011-03-15 23:01:00,322,Good job! Nice way to finish off the laker season on simcoe
562167,alphaalpha,2011-03-15 23:35:00,475,Great work for only a couple hours out there! thanks for posting.
562212,Skud,2011-03-16 01:20:00,739,"Sure fun to see them trout rush up, even better when they slam the lure. I caught my two trout in the same time frame. Before that they were just having a look."
562301,Cudz,2011-03-16 05:06:00,2652,"You should have taken it off for sure.  From what I have read and the people I talked to today, nobody went home empty handed."
562312,solopaddler,2011-03-16 09:26:00,8605,Perfect little outing.  All you Simcoe guys must be in mourning now.  What's next on the agenda?
562357,Cudz,2011-03-16 13:07:00,2652,"Not sure.  Everytime I look at one of your reports I want to take up float fishing so bad.  I live right beside simcoe and I have a bit of trouble getting time off until noon to fish at times with 3 young kids.  I will definately take it up when my kids don't want to spend time with me anymore.  I figure that will come in the next 7 years or so. I will be like 46 or 47 by then which sounds a bit old to take something up but I will give it a go for sure.  I used to river fish every weekend when I was a teenager.  Used to go to Beaver river and Saugeen back inthe day.  I even had an 11ft rod but I had a spinning reel. One day, one day!!"
562476,Leecher,2011-03-16 19:30:00,7832,You got them lakers dialed in    Too bad it was the last day Leechman
562552,misfish,2011-03-17 00:12:00,29133," They do look dark Chris,could be naturals.    Still time for some Simcoe pike and perch. Im pike,n this saturday(as you know),then it,s river time.Might do some perch,n if the ice permits.  Hope to see you on the weekend bring the kiddies.  Nice fish bud."
562559,ctranter,2011-03-17 00:30:00,543,"Nice fish man, that ice will be gone soon so good on you for getting out 1 more time."
562565,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-17 00:47:00,2050,Dude you caught more fish this week then I caught this year so far! Lookin good!
