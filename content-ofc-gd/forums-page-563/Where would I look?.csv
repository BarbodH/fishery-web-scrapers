I don't know how to use Ebay and a bit cautious using my credit card online with an unknow store. Does anybody know of a store(KW to Toronto area) that may sell a charger for the above mentioned flashlight or better yet has one kicking around?  Thanks, Todd."

562201,irishfield,2011-03-16 00:55:00,26272,FWIW.. I have never had my ccard scammed buying on line. The local full serve Noco Gas station... another story all together!!! For all locals here.. don't ever buy gas there or walk your card inside. They write all your info down off the card and knowing you're a regular pull out the phone book to find your phone number and mailing address to complete the puzzle. Then they try to order stuff on line with your card.
562203,duxbware,2011-03-16 01:03:00,102,  Thanks for the info guys. I might have to look into getting a paypal account. Unfortunately I see victims of fraud everyday at work. Can never be to careful these days.......
