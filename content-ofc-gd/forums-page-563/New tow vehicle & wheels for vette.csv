561497,corvette1,2011-03-14 00:08:00,1765,"Bought a 2004 Suburban....new to me........in great shape, the only thing I have to do is paint the bumpers in the spring...... I think it will tow the pro-v nicely and have lots of space for stuff.  I bought the truck off ebay and went a little crazy and bought new two piece wheels for my corvette.......  Thought I would share........     "

561977,Harrison,2011-03-15 12:54:00,2202,"If you don't mind me asking corvette1, how was your buying experience on Ebay for the truck?  I am looking for the exact same vehicle, 03 to 04.  Up here they are still well over the 10,000 mark.  Did you see the truck first, or just ""wing"" it?  Just curious.  Phil"
561982,fishrking,2011-03-15 13:04:00,24,Before I bought my Yukon I towed for years with a Suburban - awesome vehicles.
561995,bigbuck,2011-03-15 14:08:00,2449,Nice Texas Cadillac!!! My buddy has one and it's been a great vehicle for him. He must have north of 400k on it by now and it's been pretty much trouble free other than regular maintenance. I've driven it a few times and LOVE IT. I see a truck in my future.
562005,DanD,2011-03-15 14:45:00,2223,"Aftermarket rims, on a Vette; that’s sacrilege!!!! If you’re going too do that you may as well have saved the money on the Burb and put a hitch on the Vette. Oh man aftermarket rims what a shame, what a shame.  Oh by the way the truck and the rims look great; you’ll love the Suburban. It’ll be like driving your living room couch and storage shed down the road; plus having all the ponies to get the work done of pulling the boat.  Congratulation on the buy(s).  Dan.  PS- My 86 Vette is still wearing her original rims and she looks quite proud in them."
562178,corvette1,2011-03-16 00:20:00,1765,well dan every corvette looks the same so i wanted a new look my last 01 had BBS wheels
