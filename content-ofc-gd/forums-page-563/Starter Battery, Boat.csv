With replacement in sight I find it hard to ignore this option for only 37 bucks!  Anyone ever used a starter battery other than marine and what happened?  Thanks for your input."
562348,bigbuck,2011-03-16 12:41:00,2449,"The problem with non-marine batteries is that they aren't designed for marine use. In a boat, a battery takes quite a pounding from hitting waves. Marine batteries are constructed to take that abuse. You can get a cheap starting battery from WalMart and Canadian Tire, it's about $30-40 more and will be the correct battery for your use. Besides, that battery doesn't have much capacity, if you run a fishfinder for any length of time, that battery will run down."
562350,Roy,2011-03-16 12:45:00,13728,That battery is 165 CCA I believe. (Cold Cranking Amps) I reckon you'd need at least 450 CCA minimum for your outboard. It has nothing to do with starter battery or deep cycle.
562368,bigbuck,2011-03-16 14:03:00,2449,"That battery would probably start your outboard but that's all it will do. You are better off having a bigger battery then you need because you are out on the water, getting stranded would not be much fun."
