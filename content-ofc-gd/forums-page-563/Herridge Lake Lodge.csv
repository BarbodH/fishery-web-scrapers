216826,goodtimer,2008-06-18 15:22:00,53,Planning a trip up to Herridge Lake Logde up in Temagami in a few weeks. Can't waitttt!!!  Wondering if anyone's stayed there or fished the lake and/or surrounding lakes:  HERRIDGE LAKE ICELAND LAKE DRIFTWOOD LAKE WASAKSINA LAKE VIOLET LAKE CATCH & RELEASE LAKE  Not looking for spots or anything but just how your general experience was.  Any info would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks

Homer, overall the trip was a success but fishing was only so so... mind you the weather wasn't really in our favour, so hopefully you have better luck.  We only fished Herridge Lake, and one of the back lakes (I think Iceland??).  Not sure if you found my report or not - report  I do remember the owner's son coming back with some decent size pike...owner's weren't impressed with our lack of fish haha  Feel free to PM I'll try to help if I can.  Good luck have a great trip we await your report!"
