562529,misfish,2011-03-16 22:11:00,29133,  Oh the boss is going to give ya an    kicking for that.
562538,bigugli,2011-03-16 23:23:00,6138, You mean Terry's gonna get a Bohica?
562548,Beans,2011-03-16 23:59:00,3339,I cut my teeth on the original Lake Simcoe board after learning about it from Chris' (the originator's) dad at the little dock beside the bridge over the Holland River at hwy 11 at Bradford...  Sad to see the way a couple of yo-yos can get away with ruining a board without the admins stepping up and banishing them...
562549,misfish,2011-03-17 00:00:00,29133, Only he will know.Im sure he wont tell us Bruce..
562410,EE_,2011-03-16 16:45:00,36,....not for me
562411,Terry,2011-03-16 16:46:00,14456,doesn't work for me  it needs to die and be reborn with a couple of fools gone
562413,EE_,2011-03-16 16:48:00,36,Thanks MrBeee.....miss your vids
562416,misfish,2011-03-16 16:56:00,29133,"  I thought his name was Terry,whos mrbeee??????????"
562418,Terry,2011-03-16 16:59:00,14456, that would be Mr Terry B to you..LOL
562419,NAW,2011-03-16 17:01:00,4022,No luck for me either..  Wonder if she's down for the count?
562425,Guest gbfisher,2011-03-16 17:31:00,0,I don't think Mr D knows what way is up with his board or that he really cares. It is for sale after all and more than likely wants to much for it. It will die a sad death no doubt.  PPPFFFTTT!   
562437,Spiel,2011-03-16 17:54:00,9065,"Shame what has been going on there, Shane would not be impressed.  But to answer the question, it's working for me at this moment and worked fine earlier this morning."
562438,misfish,2011-03-16 18:01:00,29133, Keep it up Missy
562440,Terry,2011-03-16 18:20:00,14456,I just tried again  and I still can't get on
562441,Spiel,2011-03-16 18:22:00,9065," I just tried again and I'm on Terry, slow to load but it has been slow for a while.   http://www.lakesimcoemessageboard.com/"
562443,Terry,2011-03-16 18:25:00,14456,I am on rogers...sometimes that can make a difference  just tried again   maybe I'm banned...LOL
562444,Roy,2011-03-16 18:26:00,13728,I'm ok...maybe a few of you have been banned?
562445,bubbles,2011-03-16 18:27:00,591,Who cares?
562446,EE_,2011-03-16 18:28:00,36,Thanks guys Still not working for me Sounds like a server-related issue May be the new admin is doing a bit of warm up
562458,misfish,2011-03-16 19:03:00,29133, Rogers here aswell.No go.
562468,Tdel,2011-03-16 19:17:00,393,"I have been to the site a few times today.  Latest was just at 3:11pm. I have had no problem and I don't use Rogers, so maybe it is Rogers causing your problem.  Tom"
562472,jimmer,2011-03-16 19:24:00,2730,Hope so! I couldn't get on when I just tried. It's a shame what happened there.
562475,EE_,2011-03-16 19:26:00,36," That said, you do"
562478,OrangePeal,2011-03-16 19:37:00,37,Still not working here.  Jack
562499,misfish,2011-03-16 20:27:00,29133,"  I found it informative,but not controlled/managed properly."
562506,Fisherman,2011-03-16 20:58:00,7201," That would be the understatement of this season on that board. I'd like to see what a couple of those vegetables look like, probably genetically modified."
562518,skeeter,2011-03-16 21:31:00,1907,Not working from here either. Maybe Spiel is Special. Im on Rogers too.
562525,Familyfisherman,2011-03-16 21:52:00,188,"I was on in the morning but can't get on now, I'm with Bell.  To add to the discussion, it is absolutely idiotic what's gone on for the last few months.  There has to be a simple way to delete problem people -- there's some great folks on there who would be more than happy to moderate, and would do a great job of it.  The site has helped me more than any other -- I live in Barrie, so fishing Lake Simcoe is very convenient, but simply can't be done successfully without some guidance.  Insane that a few extreme people can ruin a board so easily..."
562527,Terry,2011-03-16 21:59:00,14456,and that site gets far more hits then anyone seems to know  I post an underwater video on this site and it get 100 to 400 hits when I post it on that site I get 800 to 2000 hits....one heck of a lot of people just look on that site  it would be a money maker if done right
