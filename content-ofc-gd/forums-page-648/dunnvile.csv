490213,fishinguypat,2010-08-01 04:08:00,547,"i was wondering is the cat-fishing in dunnville really that good, i saw an episode of fishncanada where they were catching huge catfish. does the entire river have a good population or is it area specific?"
490226,pikehunter,2010-08-01 10:47:00,1659,Best in the spring. Try around April till May-June or soon after ice out. Still some around now but the catch is not so hot and it will be discouraging.
490242,dave524,2010-08-01 12:08:00,4508,"I think the bulk of the fish in the spring are spawners from the lake. If you want cats now, I lived in Port Rowan and Long Point when I was younger and caught cats up to 20lbs , 8-10 average, surf casting on the lake side of Long Point in the evening. Same baits, shrimp, worm balls, cut baits, couple oz. pyramid sinkers on 9 foot saltwater spinnners, rod stands with bells on and a campfire. I remember we got them right up to duck season and August was probably the hottest month, in all these years never have gone back to see if they are still there, but have good memories of a great times, best spot was down off Hasting's Ave near the old Big Creek channel. The bottom was all sand where we got them, it was quite a well known fishery at that time, sometimes a few carloads would come from Detroit and fish there."
490834,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-03 14:56:00,932,"Go in the Spring - we've done quite well down there on occasion, or got skunked on other occasions - you can get some big Cats - 25-30lbs.  We usually go at the end of April."
491749,fishinguypat,2010-08-05 23:10:00,547,well what if i went now where could i fish?
491824,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-06 01:28:00,932, Ask Fishmaster - he owns that tackle shop in Dunnville and has a good knowledge base of channel cats.  Most cats are in the big lake this time of year.
491843,Frank,2010-08-06 01:59:00,74," Billsthebassman is right, Just go to Fishmasters store and talk to Steve Hardcastle he will point you in the right direction.  Just for the record, I have been fishing the Grand River in Dunnville the last two weeks for cats and I have not caught anything worth bragging about. There has been alot of people fishing around the dam for Walleye, but I would suggest trying out Port Maitland, although you may catch more sheephead than cats, I'am sure you will have a fun time fishing out that way regardless of what you land."
491871,alexcba,2010-08-06 03:39:00,634,"my dads a die hard cat guy, as are my cousins. pretty sure you can find them in caledonia. i preffer above the dam, my cousins preffer just down the river before the bridge. they go weekly and always get into good fish."
491873,fishinguypat,2010-08-06 04:06:00,547,"hmmm, well we got a few days off next week so where could i get into some fish on the river, not just catfish a friend told me there are many bridges there?"
491874,alexcba,2010-08-06 04:20:00,634,"in caledonia there are 2 bridges. argyle st bridge, and the rail bridge above the dam. i fish the south side of the river across argyle above the damn. forfar st i believe. night time + chicken liver = killer!"
