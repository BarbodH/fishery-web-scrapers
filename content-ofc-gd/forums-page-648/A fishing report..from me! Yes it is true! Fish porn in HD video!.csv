The weather report did not look promising with 25 Km/h SW winds and storms predicted. So we decided to run out of Dalhousie. The previous days NNE winds would likely have pushed the bait and oxygen to the south western shore, so we had some protection and a likely baitfish location. We left the launch at 6:00 am. Headed out to the 'red sky in the morning'..uh oh...but it was a lovely sight.<br />    <br />Tony quickly got the set ups going... Two riggers, two dipseys. We could have ran two more rods, but four seemed like plenty.<br />  <br/ >   Soon, we were trolling. The current below the surface was amazingly 2 MPH faster than the current above. The surface speed would read 1.8 MPH but the speed at the cannon ball was much quicker! The speed had to be adjusted each time we changed directions. Tony's attention to details like that was impressive, to say the least. I can see why he won the boat last year!  We found the baitfish..FAST! Tons of baitfish..the baitballs were incredible and they were everywhere. <br />   <br />You can see the fish working the bait!<br />   Julie was on the hotseat first. Within a few minutes..bang! A big chinook on...but it was shortlived. The mature salmon are already turning to their fall colours and the males are already developing the big kipes and teeth. Hookups, even with sticky sharp hooks, were not guaranteed! <br /> This reel screamer peeled lots of lines before I got to the camera. <br/> <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value="" But, her redemption came quick with this gorgeous steelhead! Nice fight and beauty fish.<br /> <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value="" The pic! <br />  <br /> Next, I managed to get into a small bow, myself. Not pic worthy!! But here is a picture of my back <br />  <br /> Julie then go into a laker on the Dipsey rod. <br /> <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value="" And the vertical hug hold  <br />  <br />  The more fish she caught, the less clothes she was wearing  <br />  <br /> Yet another big fish!<br />  <br /> We moved out to deeper water since the fish stuck to the baitfish seemed to shut down. Out a few miles we found some deep water and some active roaming cohos. These fish were non-stop and alot of fun. A few double headers. I just hooked into when when the outside rod went off, too and Julie got into her first coho. Julie got hers in first and was just unhooked, but still in the net when I got mine in.<br /> <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""  Double Header!!!! <br />   <br />More fish on!! <br /> <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value="" The big jumper! <br />  <br />  I was on the hot seat for one last fish. It was roasting hot out there and we had fished for 8 hours. The wind and rain never came. The conditions were against us, but Tony had no problems fishing the fish. <br/>  <br />    All totalled we caught and released more than 20 fish. I was burnt, beat and smelled really bad I certainly learned quite a bit watching Tony set up and make changes. It was lots of fun to watch as coho would show up on the Lowrance and Tony would say 'Get ready' and within seconds a rod would pop off...usually when you where looking at another one. I don't even know how many double headers we got. But we got into chinooks, cohos, rainbows and even a laker. We had hoped for an Atlantic to finish the Grand Slam but couldn't find any. Great thanks to you Tony! I haven't had that much success in a single trip in many years. And I know Julie is still stoked and wants to do it again!"

491246,torco,2010-08-04 13:53:00,656,Well done. Great report.
491250,johnnyb,2010-08-04 14:20:00,3413,Excellent report....and what an incredible day!  I'm curious about the cannonball speed....does Tony have a sensor on the actual cannonball?  I never realized you could track the speed of things down there.  
491258,bigfish1965,2010-08-04 14:54:00,3382, Yeah. Tony has a device right above the cannonball that measures temp and speed..I think it was called a FishHawk. It was interesting to watch. Surface temps from 71 to 74 degrees and 25 feet down it was in the 40's!
491261,mepps,2010-08-04 14:57:00,1301,great report Rick!
491269,TennesseeGuy,2010-08-04 15:21:00,957,Nice report.  You made it interesting and informative.
491332,johnnyb,2010-08-04 19:06:00,3413," FishHawk you say....I've heard the name, anyway.  More shopping...woohoo!  I believe the temp difference...was in Minden on the weekend and the top 20 feet were in the 70's, while 30 feet down it was low 50's!"
491338,bulltron,2010-08-04 19:23:00,88,wow! those are some beautiful fish!
