We took my little tin boat down to the local creek and ended up hooking into a couple bass and some pike.  Choice bait for the evening was chartreuse spinner baits with a chartreuse blade.  My buddy was a little camera shy, but here are my highlight fish.    The wife thought I lost my smile when we got married.... I told her I just need a decent fish in my hands!    Now, I am pretty new to fishing, and don't claim to know very much... but from what I remember reading you should try to match your lure choice to the water conditions correct?  So dark stained water go with darker lures? and clear water on bright days use more colorful lures correct?  I pretty much just toss whatever I have in my bag, but would love to actually make some sort of real lure choice when fishing different waters... Am I understanding this correctly? or does someone want to break it down!"
491702,Raf,2010-08-05 20:35:00,3495,looks like you picked the right colours there.  there are no hard & fast rules.  let the fish tell ya what they want.  i primarily fish tea stained to clear water and like blues/purples/whites/natural colours on dark days/sunrise/sunset and the gawdier/metallic colours on bright days.  black seems to work anytime and anywhere.  that's not to say you wont catch a fish on a firetiger bait during a rainstorm.

491713,TC1OZ,2010-08-05 21:14:00,987,Thanks for the read guys & the tips!  Honestly... I think the fish in this creek will hit anything... its the only place I never get skunked!
