It seem to me that the easiest form or shape for these would be a straight push in product, like the style used on the Mr. Twister or Mustad keeper hooks, some sort of barbed wire to hold the soft plastic bait and a quick clip on ring to the hook.  I have seen and used the screw in style, seen the self centering screw on style, it seems like over complication of a simple idea? any thoughts?"
