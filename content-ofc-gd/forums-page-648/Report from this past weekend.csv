491502,Joey,2010-08-05 03:05:00,9122,"I don't know how we missed each other.  Kevin was going to tell me where you were and then got yacking about something else and then forgot to tell us.  I did look for you (or a new camp set up) when we pulled our boat Saturday night and did the drive around the camp ground, but since I don't know what you look like, it was fruitless  The fishing was really tough.  We went to all our usual spots and as my report shows, only caught 1 pike each and I got two small pickerel.  That was it for 4 days!!  I imagine the low water levels and silty water is to blame.  Hopefully we'll meet up next time.  Joey"
491625,SBCregal,2010-08-05 16:22:00,688,"Joey,  we were actually heading out on the boat and saw you two pull away from the cabin and go around the campsite.  we were in site 1 i believe it was, on the left side of the road on the way towards the washrooms, we were in a jayco tent trailer and green gmc safari van.  I actually saw you two a couple of times, that time and once when we were coming in and you were heading out.  guess thats just the way it goes.  i was the guy with the big long beard/goatee.  ryan"
