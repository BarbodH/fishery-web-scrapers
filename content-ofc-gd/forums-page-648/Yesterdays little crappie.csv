491769,jediangler,2010-08-05 23:56:00,1923,I've never caught anything on those jointed canadian wigglers. Maybe I'll have to target crappie with them next time.
491771,vinnimon,2010-08-06 00:07:00,2593,"If you do jedi,I was troling at top speed with a 30 pnd thrust minkota endura ,when he nibbled.Had a few others try and failed!  If I hit the mandarin Mike Pike,I'll bring the lure and run around with it.Seeing that you are accussed of the same thing(just kidden)!I may throw it in the pond at the entrance way"
491904,Mike Pike,2010-08-06 13:00:00,1332,"Ya know, Vinnimon, I've targetted Crappie there and have never really had much luck.  Now I know why.  I've been using micro-grubs and such when I should have been using big jointed plugs!  lol"
