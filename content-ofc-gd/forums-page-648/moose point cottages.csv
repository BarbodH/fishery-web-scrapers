We are looking at booking a cottage there this fall for some duck hunting and fishing. Looking for OFNers input.I heard that fishing there in the fall is tough. I find this hard to believe as fall fishing for smallies and walleye is great. Any info will help.  Thanks, Todd."
490811,Muskieman,2010-08-03 13:52:00,2472,I always fish Tomiko 20 minutes from my house... and my camper will be @ Moose Point in October... Walleye and Bass are rather easy to catch there in the fall 15-25 FOW.  Jig & Leech. Paul and Linda are great hosts.(so are Turbo and Charger golden retrievers) Enjoy your stay.  Randy

They will tell you where to go and catch fish, I did well there for the eyes and smallies in September. Good luck with the hunt"
