491383,jjcanoe,2010-08-04 22:13:00,744,Anybody been out of Port Colbourne or Crystal Beach lately have anything to share?  Planning on heading down that way on Sunday before I pick up my son from Grandmas house.  Should I put the riggers on the boat and troll for Walleye or forget that and just fish for Bass?  I always can do the upper or Lower Niagara if the weather is crap. I would prefer to stay away from Lake O. due to the water fleas (I don't have flea flicker line) and since I'm bringing the boat to the cottage shortly and don't need the cottage lake infested with water fleas!  Reply or Pm would be greatly appreciated  Thanks!  jjcanoe

Jets and harnesses and or get on bottom....you will find them all.  Make a stop at 'Fishin Niagara' across from the launch and Denis can point you in the right direction.

I've got all the gear, riggers, dipseys, jets, torpedos, etc, form what I've been hearing, harnesses are king in the east, spoons and hard baits work better in the west, Denis' shop is in Fort Erie in the parkway I think...  jjcanoe"
