491291,EC1,2010-08-04 17:09:00,930,"Good Afternoon all! I'm currently being given a task to find a cottage for my family, which wants to go to a cottage starting on August 23rd.  There's a few specific criteria that my dad wants for this trip: - Spacious Environment - We are not packing 5 people in one room. 2 or 3 rooms would be perfect. - A nice restaurant nearby - Not a burger joint, but doesn't need to be one where you need to dress up to go to either. - Within 2.5 hours from Toronto. Preferably Kawartha's or Kingston and area. Muskoka's are also possible, Although I don't like fishing in more than 15FOW.  You guys are free to recommend anything, as I'm open to any suggestions.  Heck, If you want to rent out your own cottage to my family for a week, we'll promise to put a few holes into a few fish's mouths, and make sure it looks exactly the same as the week prior! Thanks in Advance !"

We booked a family cottage for 1 week/year for about 8 of us and we typically book very early in the new year as good cottages go fast."
