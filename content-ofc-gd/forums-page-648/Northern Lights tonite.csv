490777,lew,2010-08-03 10:28:00,12766,This mornings news was talking about a larger than normal solar flare recentely which should give us a good display of the Northern Lights tonite and again tomorrow night.  Guess I don't have to tell ya that you need to be facing north to see them
490778,Handlebarz,2010-08-03 10:46:00,3790,not sure if we can even see them from the deep south but when  I lived in Sudbury they were amazing to see nothing better then being up at camp with no hydro or lights around and watching them dance hope everyone who can get out and watch them takes advantage of the night
490841,bulltron,2010-08-03 15:13:00,88," The news just said people will be able to see it as far south as Houston TX, up until Thursday morning. Thats alot of sun-flare."
490844,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-03 15:26:00,932,I'm most certainly going to give it a shot - would love to see them again.  Hopefully they shine on KW.
490846,tybrad,2010-08-03 15:29:00,45,Sposed to be cloudy tonight   here's to hoping it isnt

491329,torco,2010-08-04 19:01:00,656,Couldn't see them in Guelph last night.  Hopefully tonight...
491331,lew,2010-08-04 19:06:00,12766,It's very dark here at night and last night cleared up beautifully with even the stars shining but the Northern Lights failed to show up.  Hopefully tonight.
491337,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-04 19:22:00,10439,Didn't see a thing up here in Yellowknife. Of course it's still too light all the time for such things. A few more weeks and it will actually get dark. Then we will have plenty of dark for months.
491529,EC1,2010-08-05 07:18:00,930,"Did anyone see them tonight? I was in the Peterborough Area and looked all over, but the northern lights were no where to be found."
491531,lew,2010-08-05 09:21:00,12766,Nothing last night either but when I was out on the back deck at 4:30 this morning a large bright meteor shot across the sky directly overhead.  Not exactly the Northern Lights but still a heck of a nice way to start the day.
491532,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-05 09:37:00,2582,That wasn't a meteor Lew. It was my alarm clock that I shot out of bed when it woke me up for work this morning
491626,Kawartha Kev,2010-08-05 16:24:00,281, Probably an early Perseid meteor Lew the Perseid meteor shower peaks in a week or so check out this site for up to date info if you are interested  Spaceweather Info  enjoy Kawartha Kev
491844,Fisherman,2010-08-06 02:00:00,7201,"Well it's 10pm and I'm not playing tag with the mosquitos anymore, I think someone forgot to pay the electric bill."
491848,vinnimon,2010-08-06 02:06:00,2593,"  Meters runnin here,bills paid!,gonna take a peak out the door with the kids."
