Prior to taking this job I worked on high end commercials @ Technicolor in Toronto.  I actually worked a few floors up from another board member ( FishnSled ) who works on movies and TV shows.  This was one of my favorite moments from Season 3 and I didn't even have a rod in my hand!  It's always nice being part of somebodies ""personal best"" moment!    The weather made for tough shooting conditions but we still pulled off a good show in my mind!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myl_KcYZVaE  So, this thread came up some 4 years ago which is how I got connected with Dave, so I figured it's been long enough...  What pays your bills, and funds your obsession with fishing?  Cheers, Ryan"
