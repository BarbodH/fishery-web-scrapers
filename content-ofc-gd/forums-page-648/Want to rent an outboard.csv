491467,danbouck,2010-08-05 02:21:00,4380,I'm leaving for Restoule in a couple days and I want to rent a motor for at least a day. I will have my old Johnson but would like to take the wife and kids for at least 1 day trip exploring via boat. Needless to say I NEED something reliable. Anybody know of a place on the lake or on the way where I can rent one?
