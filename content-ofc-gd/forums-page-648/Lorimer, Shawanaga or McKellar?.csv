I used to have a cottage on Lorimer a few years back and was thinking about taking a trip to refish the lake, but was also wondering what the fishing was like in Shawanaga and McKellar.  I've seen some fairly big pike and smallies in Lorimer, anyone know how the other 2 compare?"

I would like to know about Shawanaga as well ,not too far from the trailer for day trips ! I have fished Manitouwabing for years and it is a good lake so I would go there instead of Mckellar .
