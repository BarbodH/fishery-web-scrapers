491105,Black_Blade,2010-08-04 01:50:00,258,"Was curious what others do with their fish wastes when out camping for a few days.  With the increase in bear population, cleaning of the fish should be done as far away from the campsite as possible, but what do you all do with the carcass?  Bury, toss into the lake (away from shore)...  Have left carcasses in the water before and seen gulls a few minutes later down the shoreline a ways having a feast."
491108,ctdd2006,2010-08-04 01:52:00,531,...try having a board on the boat and clean mid-lake and dump there prior to shore lunch/supper.
491121,jedimaster,2010-08-04 02:13:00,3472,Just eat em whole   We use the guts to bait for bears so we can watch them mow down from across the lake. haha jk....  Gut them in the middle of the lake and leave em there. If you do it at another campsite someone else could be using that camp site the next night.
491170,bow slayer,2010-08-04 03:28:00,1074,"we just throw them in the campfire,burn all left over food and scraps."
491172,ch312,2010-08-04 03:30:00,1590,toss em in the lake. if they dont sink they will just drift to shore where the critters usually have them cleaned up by morning. the critters get a free meal and nothing gets wasted...win win
491203,solopaddler,2010-08-04 09:34:00,8605, That's actually the worst thing you can do. The smell will draw them in from miles away.  I usually clean them on a rock far from camp and let the gulls clean up the scraps.
491205,scugpg,2010-08-04 10:29:00,1373,Isn't it illegal to just dump the remains in the lake?
491215,Fish4Eyes,2010-08-04 11:49:00,1022,The bear can still pick up the scent even if you have the fillets in your cooler. I read a MNR bear report that suggested you should even change your clothes that you went fishing in before you go to sleep in a tent.
491238,Billy Bob,2010-08-04 13:29:00,5865,Please BEAR with us...  In NYS we can dump them in the lake as long as it's over 100 feet from shore but we can't legally clean them within 100 feet from shore...go figure....
491240,troutologist,2010-08-04 13:35:00,951,"Well away from your campsite (or anyone elses) toss the remains on a flat rock or open area at the waters edge, this will allow the gulls to see them quick and dispose of them.  If you fish and camp, you, your boat, your site will always have some attractive odours, keep food securly stored and away from the tent and chances are you will have no trouble."
491256,livinisfishin,2010-08-04 14:52:00,661,Lol so you turn it into sushi when you are camping solopaddler? What's so different from cooking then what bowslayer suggested? Hah
491264,bigfish1965,2010-08-04 15:04:00,3382, No it isn't. It is the best ecological approach. It feeds the crayfish and bait fish. You keep those nutrients in the food chain. That is where the guts would have ended up had the fish died of natural causes. It is best to dump in about 10 ft of water where the bottom has a high oxygen level.
491268,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-04 15:08:00,10439,I usually clean on an opposite shore or small island & never within a half mile of camp.
491277,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-04 16:15:00,947,We usually dump the scarps in the the middle of the lake that way no animals will come around.  Our grease we dump in the fire when the fire is cold of course
491294,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-08-04 17:19:00,0,I have always left them on a rock and was told to do so by a CO.
491297,POLLIWOGG,2010-08-04 17:27:00,835,Do not put them in the water close to shore within 30 miles of a pro bass fishing tourny or you will end up on the 6 o'clock news for killing every fish in the lake.
491524,Ben_Daniels,2010-08-05 06:05:00,435, Nail on the head.  -Ben
491549,BillM,2010-08-05 11:56:00,17367," The difference is the gulls/ravens and turkey vultures will clean them up in no time, instead of burning them and sending the yummy flavours 100's of feet into the air and into the noses of hungry bears, lol."
491557,Fisherpete,2010-08-05 12:39:00,1814,I always take the remains to a swampy area and dump them there - the turtles eat it up quick.
491710,bbog,2010-08-05 20:48:00,665,Return them to the lake..
491742,livinisfishin,2010-08-05 22:33:00,661,I get the point entirely I'm just asking what is the difference when you cook the fish? Such as the whole carcass stuffed with spices and what not that is left on the fire for a good while if you are slow cooking it?
491747,bow slayer,2010-08-05 23:07:00,1074," I have been throwing the waste from fish in the fire for 25 years I have been going north. My dad is the one who  told me. I have never had an bear come into camp whether it be in a park or back country camping. I really don't see a difference of cooking food or incinerating the scraps from fillets in a campfire,are you not to cook or store food at the site(which i think may be more pleasing to a bears nose than say some scraps burning in a bonfire) I think leaving the waste in the lake is the best option but sometimes we come in late off the water fillet the fish on cardboard and newspaper,then when done throw the waste fish and paper in the fire,although i have been known to throw one or two to a eager  watching raccoon from time to time."
491785,Sinker,2010-08-06 00:40:00,8692,"I think y'all are scared of bears  I clean them at camp, and toss them in the lake. Be sure to pop the air bladder first.  S."
