491254,doubleheader,2010-08-04 14:43:00,497," I don't think this will ever happen but I do agree BB. Back to the issue though, perhaps this will go the other way, perhaps this will result in additional stocking and a better fishery than we have today. Certainly if there is no sustainable fishery there is no industry, so I tend to think this may very well result in an improved fishery.  A good portion of my home waters is on Seneca Nations land. We need to buy their license to fish, no problem there, and now they are taking the initiative to develop their own walleye stocking program, complete with hatchery. That's pretty sound forward thinking and everyone wins."
491262,Billy Bob,2010-08-04 14:59:00,5865, I have a friend who is watching this development VERY close as the Seneca's don't have a good history on these things and the money is coming from the Feds. Time will tell.

Seeing an investment like this, helps me continue that belief. They wouldn't bother doing this if their plan was to slash and burn the population. Our non-native commercial fishers do not exactly have a sterling record. Lets hope that the Natives see this as a chance to shed some of the bad PR and continue diligent enforcement."

What I see are a group of people who have been frustrated, trying to develop an even larger market for their wares. They have not been able to sell their fish to just anyone in the past as their processing systems was inadequate with regard to provincial standards. The opening of this plant, just opened up an entirely new market for ""their"" fish. Seems to me that then have just been given a green light to catch and process as many fish as they can sell, which historically they couldn't do. I've seen the look on locals faces as they ""hope"" that their lake will return to its glory days... hope is quickly diminishing. HH"

When all of these treaties were signed the natural world was looked at as mostly inexhaustible that is why these same treaties should not be used today.  Also another poster mentioned that some groups seemingly have a hate on for natives, well I have a hate on for citiots and their children who have been indoctrinated into the left wing group think that tells over and over of the noble savage and the keepers of the earth Bull, it is paternalistic crap.  They are no different than we are, they are just as likely to abuse the resource and since their taxes don't pay to maintain our resources they may be even less likely to protect it than we are.  Take off your liberal colored glasses for god sakes, join us in the real world.  I have told this story here before, but in Nova Scotia, after they won the right to net the salmon rivers, the river nearest to my home is only a few minutes form the nearest reserve, instead of netting the river they continually broke into a science station on the river that was tracking fish numbers as a part of a stocking program.  The fish were trapped in the ladder and were easily netted.  It took months of complaints before anything was done, eventually a number of arrests were made, though I doubt they were ever prosecuted, that used to be a beautiful area, it is now a native booze can garbage dump.  Few people go there to fish anymore, but then there really aren't any fish now.  I hope it goes better here, but for those of us that have been paying attention the science behind the harvest on Nippising is shaky at best, must be the racism, after all the biologist that is most responsible for the management of the lake is now on the band payroll, no conflict of interest there, nope."

491570,swishmick,2010-08-05 13:30:00,8,"Where's the science on this issue?  Are the quota's ""sustainable"" as advertised, or not?  Is anyone here familiar with quota methodology?  Is there a publicly available MNR of Ontario guide for this?  And is its defintion of sustainability laden with economic and cultural and heritage and political and social justice considerations?  IIRC, the FMP and FMP Backgrounder for FMZ 17 containing Rice Lake (referring to the RLTA thread a while back) cited studies from lakes other than Rice Lake to support the case for a dimunition in the ""quality"" of the size structure of Rice Lake sunfish.  There were lots of long term stats from sampling Rice Lake itself that, to my eye, didn't suggest any real hurt in the sunfish population despite the longstanding unlimited take regulation.  Additionally, the Plan noted the undesirable introduced species status for pumpkinseeds in most of that chain and a potential negative impact on juvenile walleye (I'll have to re-read the Plans to refresh my understanding).  The case for a theat didn't seem all that solid to me, more of an err on the side of caution, precautionary principle in practice - not that there's too much wrong with that.  And perhaps that's why it was presented coincidentally with a plan to promote the panfish fishery in the zone and manage it for trophies and higher quality accordingly.  Nothing wrong with that: the RLTA was about dollars and a ""new"" fishery, including the ice fishing season, should've made them happy despite losing a few resource intensive American customers.  Is the Nip's walleye fishery any clearer to scientists?  And for that matter, does anyone have a link to a list of all Fisheries Management Plans for all zones in Ontario?  If the ""science"" describes a healthy fishery and sustainable harvesting by natives and non-natives, will everyone cool it?  Why is there so much of a cry for more enforcement and policing when the potential payoff from more science and monitoring is so much greater?  The impact of poaching has to be small potatoes compared to a lack of knowledge.  And, on the economics side, the impact of the Native walleye fishery must pale in comparison to the non-Native spending.  If the Native's new enterprise can contribute additional funding to science and research, which should eventually subdue the politics, what's the worry?  The more valuable the fishery is for its stakeholders, the better it'll be managed, assuming that people are self-interested, of course.  That's the one-rule-for-everybody that'll apply most soundly in this situation.  OT- Is a Native near monopoly on walleye distorting the market price?

If the issue is that there are too many fish being taken either through quotas or illegally, then THAT is the issue. But turning a previously black market fisherman into a legit one that can actually make a living off of the fish he sells is a good thing. It has to do with stewardship and making the people who are close to the resource ""self policing"". IE now you will have fisherman who were poaching before and are now making a good living snitching and/or using peer pressure to help prevent the unethical ones from selling $2 fish from a trunk.  I guess it is all in how you choose to see it. I see it as a positive. Then again, I started this by saying I was naive...."

There will be folks out there with the $2.00 a fish still as they ""caught"" a bunch and could be over the ""limit"" so they want to keep out of trouble so $2.00 a fish it is.  Others can sit there and say, I have my limit so let's go get them cleaned up and sell it for more $.  It's all in how people perceive things and what happens in the real world.  Only time will tell but Randy is close to the area so he must have a better ""picture"" of what is really happening every day.  All I can say is I hope these stations are closely monitored..."

Not pointing any fingers and saying that is what happened here, but I think it can easily happen and we get into an ""us vs them"" mentality. All I can say to that is that they lived here for thousands of years and there was still fish when we got here. In the last maybe 100 years, we have managed to screw up just about everything.  And my original point was that taken at face value, the article is a positive one, and the plant should have a positive effect on the fishery, all things being equal."
