Caught lots of Pike, Bass, and Catfish.  Didn't do that much fishing in general but I feel the need to make this report due to one special catch.  I've been questing after Northern Pike hard for the last few years, and its been a goal to catch a 40 incher. My best to date has been 33.5"" out of Lake Ontario. I've caught hundreds and hundreds of Pike, but the majority have been hammer-handles.  Anyway, my persistance FINALLY payed off this weekened, after catching some normal sized Pike and few Bass, we decided to hit a weedy point that was near to deep water. I cast my large green Rapala into the weeds and BOOM, a huge hit. Once I saw the fish I knew it was a dandy. The fish fought hard, completely broke our net, and took both hands to lift into the boat.  Measurements were 40"" even and probably about 18 pounds, if not more.  I finally did it, the 40"" Northern Pike was caught.. and the best part about the whole experience is that the Pike was released healthy, he bolted off, and hopefully I can catch him again when he's 45 inches and 25 pounds!  What a thrill.. until next time G-Bay..  Enjoy the pics of the weekend..         The Big Boy:    "

491513,Cudz,2010-08-05 04:24:00,2652,That is a helthy looking fish. Nice gloves too.
491515,ctdd2006,2010-08-05 04:38:00,531, BOO HOO to you....
491522,Ben_Daniels,2010-08-05 05:51:00,435,Sweet Pike! I have a hell of a time getting any decent Pike at this time of Summer.  -Ben
491533,lew,2010-08-05 09:47:00,12766,"Yup, definetely a good pike and congrats on reaching your 40"" milestone."
491538,Pigeontroller,2010-08-05 11:08:00,2793,Very nice Pike!  Oouch on the old-fashioned verticle hold!
491544,rbaquial,2010-08-05 11:33:00,968,NOICE!!!
491546,corvette1,2010-08-05 11:51:00,1765,nice gator
491555,Fisherpete,2010-08-05 12:32:00,1814,"LOL ctdd2006! Hey I would gladly trade one of my big skis for a 40"" pike catch! Around here, a 40"" pike is just as hard to get as a 50"" ski!  Last pic - good hold. With bigger pike/muskie you want to hold them horizontally and support them under the belly. Second last pic - vertical hold - not good for the fish, places tons of stress on the spine (think of being held in the air by your head with your entire body weight pulling down on it) and internal organs can also be damaged."
491623,siwash,2010-08-05 16:05:00,683,Can you give us the GPS coordinates for that big boy!?  JK!
491668,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-05 19:04:00,932,Great Report and Great Pics . . . I can't wait to get back on Georgian Bay in a few weeks time - still one of my favourite fishing areas for both scenery and fishing.  
491705,jbailey,2010-08-05 20:37:00,866,"gorgeous fish, always nice to get a new PB"
491722,TC1OZ,2010-08-05 21:39:00,987,"Wow! I am still questing for the 40"" from my cottage on the Georgian Bay.... I've had a couple follows that I know where up there...... Were you guys right out on the bay? I only ever fish in the archipelagos."
491815,gonduckin,2010-08-06 01:14:00,19,"Great fish, congrats."
491820,msp,2010-08-06 01:21:00,1336,Great job on the esox!
