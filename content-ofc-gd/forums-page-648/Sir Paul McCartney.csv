I'm going to the Mon. show if anyone goes to the Sunday show please post a report can't wait to see the legend probably won't get another chance as he is really getting up there in age. Wish I could have seen him the rest of the Beatles but I was just a kid at the time of their hayday oh well still should be a great show.  Kawartha Kev
