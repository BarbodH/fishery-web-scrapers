First spot we were too far out from shore and the wind kept pushing us out further so we moved to a nice little bay off one of the islands.  Honestly I was just so happy to be out on the water and hanging out with a good friend I wasn't paying much attention....until I felt a light tug on my line....I brought in a little piece of weed..at least it was something.  Tossed the Rapala back out, felt a little tug when I started reeling it in...gave it a second to rest, then reeled in quick and had a fish on....my friend saw it before I did and said it was a Pike.  She gave a decent little fight...once I got the tension properly set     turned out to be a decent 26"" Pike and the only fish of the day.  We stayed for a little longer drifting the area, then took a ride around a bunch of islands and just enjoyed the rest of our time out there....hope to do it again soon!  Maureen"
491387,crappieperchhunter,2010-08-04 22:58:00,2582,Glad you got out Maureen. For me it's never about how many you catch. It's ALL about  just getting out and enjoying some time on the water with a friend or two.  Sounds like you had a good day to me.
491393,lew,2010-08-04 23:20:00,12766,"Good to hear you enjoyed your day off on the water Mo, and even got yerself a fish too  We had a couple nasty little mini-storms go thru here this afternoon with high winds and heavy rains but it sounds like you missed them on the Bay....fortunately."
491404,Bly,2010-08-05 00:09:00,1556,"Good for you Maureen, glad to hear you got a chance to get out with a friend and caught a fish."
491413,Beans,2010-08-05 00:49:00,3339,Hooray !!!...Glad to hear you got out and caught a fish...I keep telling Uncle Dave that it is a shame you don't get to use those custom (Spiel) built rods you have...You got better tackle than him and I combined...  Cheers Kid !!!     Finally got to fish with your great-nephew Ryan James and Robert   Both caught 2 wgsf (rock bass) off shore but Ryan caught the biggest...LOL  
491422,Victor,2010-08-05 01:14:00,1609,Haven't heard from you for a while Maureen! Glad to hear that you still got out and catch some fish!
491478,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-05 02:35:00,0,It was windy and warm out there. Better than being on shore though. Nice to see you got out and caught fish. Not many out there with the storm warnings which was nice.
