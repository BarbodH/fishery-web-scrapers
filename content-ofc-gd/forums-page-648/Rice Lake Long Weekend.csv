I made it out on Sunday for the first time and I headed out with my friends son Josh for a couple of hours of fishing. We were on the water from 10:30am until 1pm and I managed to catch 2 Smallies and 1 Walleye.    Once again the Walleye was under the slot and the Smallies were in the 2 lb range. Again they were caught on my hot stretch of shore, just off shore in 10-12 FOW. SLAMMERS were once again the ticket.    Then on holiday Monday Josh and I went out again for a couple of hours. This time we were out from about 11am until 1pm. We were on the same track as the previous day when I feel my rod go down, I set the hook and line starts peeling off.  I immediately tell him to get the net and be ready. As I am fighting the fish I am barking orders at him due to his boneheaded move the previous week where he thought he would show me how to land a fish by yanking on my rod and thus pulling the hook and line completely out of the fish. I saw it under the surface and it jumped once completely out of the water and we were both excited as it was a bigger then average fish. I must say he did a good job and he was able to net the Smallie with no problems. It measured 18"" and tipped the scale at 4.25 lbs.  I caught this one on 8 lb test on a medium light 6 foot Shimano BIS-60MLB2 rod. The new rod I bought at CT last week to replace the one Josh had in fact broke on one of the previous weekends.  After coming up dry and reaching the end of track, I tried a new stretch of shoreline. We were just outside the weedline in 10-12 FOW and shortly after that, I land another Smallie. Another small one in the high 1 lb range, maybe 2 lbs.  As we proceed down the shoreline sometime later once again, my rod tip bends and I set the hook and line once again peels off the reel. This time I was armed with 10 lb test on my Shimano Convergence CVS-70M-2A rod. I fight it for some time adjusting the drag once or twice and once again Josh was armed with the net and we knew it was big as it surfaced a few times but this one did not jump out of the water. He once again landed it beautifully due to the fact he was listening for a change. This one was bigger then the first. It measured 19"" and tipped the scale at 4.7 lbs. What a difference in the colours. Again caught on a SLAMMER. If you have never tried theses baits, I highly recommend them. They have produced Smallies like no other bait I have ever tried. Colour seems to be key.      The entire time Josh did not catch anything. He was also dropshotting but he was using a SLAMMER in a different colour. He was getting mad and wanted to change to my colour. So he did and a few minutes later he managed to land a 3+ lber. Not bad. It was my turn to be the net guy.    2 dwarfing the one Josh caught, for comparison.  All in all we enjoyed our fishing adventures. He also managed to catch 1 Goby and 1 other fish which I wasn't sure what it was. Herring or shad of some kind. First one I have seen in Rice Lake. Hope it wasn't the invasive Rudd.      Enjoy the pics. We took a bunch but they were in livewell and all were released unharmed.  Dirk"

491375,bassman,2010-08-04 21:41:00,384,Great report. Love the colour on those smallies.
491386,esoxansteel,2010-08-04 22:51:00,1307,The silver one looks like a fall fish and are very common in the Indian river and are fantastic on the fly and can go up to 2 to 3 lbs
491483,Fisherpete,2010-08-05 02:41:00,1814,Great smallies Dirk! Is your boat a Prosport SC?
491528,EC1,2010-08-05 07:11:00,930,That's some killer fish! Good Job!

491594,diggyj,2010-08-05 14:40:00,548, Yes it is.
491616,Hooked,2010-08-05 15:26:00,891,"Nice going Dirk.  I'll be up there in just over a week from now and hope I can replicate what you have been doing.  BTW, what exactly is a SLAMMER?  Is it like a senko?"
491646,Cudz,2010-08-05 17:39:00,2652,Stikezone Slammer is a drop shot bait that looks more like a goby  or minnow that anything else. They are great lures and made here in Ontario.  Get a pack and learn to drop shot.  You will not be dissapointed.  I like smoke colours best but they are all good.
