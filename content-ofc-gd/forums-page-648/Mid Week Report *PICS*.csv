It was nice to not have jetskiers doing circles around us and other boats coming to anchor 10 feet away, we had the lake almost to ourselves! Water was kind of rough in the morning but we got into some good fish.  Started up shallow without much luck, a couple little 1 pounders on the dropshot slammer.  Moved out to 25 feet and we started catching them again.  A lot of smaller (for Simcoe) fish in the 2-2.5 pound range but 2 fish in the 4.5-5 pound range.  Eve got a bonus largie, small, but it counts!  Good day out and EXTREMELY well behaved kids!      Wednesday I fished a small 16 boat tourney on Scugog with a good friend.  Neither of us had ever fished the lake before, funny since I spent 4 years at Fleming College in Lindsay, I spent that time fishing Sturgeon or towing elsewhere.  We figured we would just go fishing and we'd stumble upon them.  We had a small limit early, but the lake was tough and NOT my style of fishing LOL.  Finally in the last hour we figured something out and put our 4 biggest in the boat.  We placed 2nd but I'm not exactly itching to get back there!  Even had a nice musky to boot!  Don't get many of them in ""my waters"".   "

491609,Toddyc20,2010-08-05 15:15:00,141,Nice looking smallies there and some good luck in that tourny.  I'm gonna have to fork out and pay you to teach me how to catch smallmouth on simcoe.  Been out a few times and I'm like a tourist.  Totally lost with no idea where to start looking.
491610,Cudz,2010-08-05 15:16:00,2652,man I need to get out.  I haven't been for 2 weeks.  I have only fished Simcoe and Couch 3 times this year with 2 of those being evenings and the other being an unsuccessful hot day. Good job on the bog
491618,steverowbotham,2010-08-05 15:33:00,1800," I won on G-Pool last week, this is my first brides maid position this season.  edit: I did place 2nd in our night tourney a couple weeks ago... thanks alpha lol"
491630,alphaalpha,2010-08-05 16:48:00,475,nice work! i thought you got 2nd in that night tourney you posted about before...  either way congrats on the win!  I'm hoping to get into some tournaments next year (i'll finally be getting my own boat in the spring   ).

491645,Cudz,2010-08-05 17:35:00,2652,that smallie that the mother is holding is really fat.  Getting their feed bags on early it looks.  man I need to get out.
