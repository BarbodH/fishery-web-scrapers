473728,EC1,2010-06-08 19:16:00,930,awesome fish mike! I should be ready to take you out on the crappie trip in 2-3 weeks!
473734,fishnsled,2010-06-08 19:31:00,3520,"Fun adventures with great rewards. Cool report as well, very nicely done."
473754,dsn,2010-06-08 20:28:00,1018,Very Smooth post. You finally admit you have sick and twisted mind. Please elaborate on that....  Amazing colors on those fish. Also I can't believe those shots are from a phone camera. So crisp and clear !!   dsn
473773,Dusky,2010-06-08 20:52:00,310,"Awesome report, I see lot's of effort not only in fishing in reporting as well!!"
473786,ehg,2010-06-08 21:17:00,2666,Nice pictures of the vermiculations on the brookies and blueish hue spots on some of the browns faces. Great creativity on the prose as well. Not sure what is sick and twisted about all this
473343,MJL,2010-06-07 18:54:00,2427,"…It comes quite easily with some extraordinary finds  In the brush-lined stream there's something I seek Ice cold water flows down the creek My nuts are cold, the waders leak I see a shadow, my interest peaks  Quiet, silent and stone-like still Beneath the surface a spotted thrill It lies awaiting for its belly to fill A beautiful predator with a license to kill    Wading the stream I tread with care I tie on a streamer of feathers and hair Squinting my eyes to cut out the glare Casting the fly, I give it a prayer  My fly swings down, the trout gave a look ""Holy dude! it actually took!"" I lifted the rod and set the hook Just like I read in Craig Ritchie's book  This is the place that makes my heart-beat race Down into rapids and I hastily give chase Horsing the trout so I can see its face Slipping and falling without much grace  Into the net I try to pop out the fly Locked in its mouth I give it a pry It bit my finger! It wasn't shy Beautiful spots, seemingly painted with dye      Around the bend was this bright, spotted thing This is the thing that makes my heartbeat sing Baring the brunt of a nettle's sting I'm glad that my hook didn't fail to cling    Switching to spinners and a variety of spoons The vibration of metal seductively croons Flashes of copper and thumping tunes Victory is sweet in the bright afternoon            It's getting dark, I'm tempted to stay? Some amazing fun I had today The bugs are out, I'm mosquito prey I'll make my return at the first light of day   Some more – From this Saturday…Ironically FrozenFire and I (both into photography) forgot our cameras at home…Some pics taken with a camera phone.          Double header brookie action   I must admit that I've become obsessed with brown trout reading every journal, diary, book, message board post, stocking record, topographic map, hydrographic map, road map, top secret hand-drawn map I could get my hands on and following every lead graciously sent to me via PM …I also will shamefully admit I bought a steak dinner (…and dessert) for one of the old timers I met at the tackle shop and picked his brain on catching monster browns   …I guess there's no cure for STI (Salmo-Trutta-Itis)  I think I just screwed myself for life  All smiles"
473347,torco,2010-06-07 19:23:00,656,Awesome report. Man I love trout fishing and you had it all in this report.
473348,asdve23rveavwa,2010-06-07 19:24:00,2690,"Some very nice browns!!!  Lots of effort put into that post, well done!!!"
473350,timmeh,2010-06-07 19:29:00,609,"Fantastic man. Spend a fair bit of time on the backroads myself, and once you've put in the time and effort it can be really rewarding as you clearly know. "
473354,wankerjohn123,2010-06-07 20:02:00,117,Nice fish! Great photo's!
473357,misfish,2010-06-07 20:09:00,29133,Nicely done.

473368,wallacio,2010-06-07 20:26:00,475,"Very, very nice.  I too am afflicted with STI!   That first fish from Saturday is a stunner - the red spots are much larger (with an irregular shape) than most Browns."

473431,silverstreak,2010-06-07 23:36:00,146,Well done MJ
473433,laszlo,2010-06-07 23:40:00,487,Nice! When did you catch that Steelhead?
473440,Musky or Specks,2010-06-07 23:46:00,2710,Some very pretty fish there. Nice going
473480,Victor,2010-06-08 01:38:00,1609,"Nice report Mike, you can keep going after them trout and leave the carp alone.  Seriously though, it's heating up. Went down to the Hammy today and topped my PB by....1-lb lol."
473496,young_one,2010-06-08 01:54:00,620,"Hey MJL, if wasnt for my blood so extra tasty with mosquitoes, I'd go trekking with you! Thanks for the report! Beautiful colours."
473505,alphaalpha,2010-06-08 02:06:00,475,"gorgeous fish! great report, thanks for posting!"
473513,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-08 02:20:00,932,It's always a pleasure seeing and reading these reports . . . extremely well done (as always).  Beauty fish.
473550,MJL,2010-06-08 03:00:00,2427,"Thanks guys for the comments…Those browns fought surprisingly well…A good number of them pulled drag and most tried to swim towards just about anything wood.  A few jumped almost as high as my head – Pretty amazing to see.  I’ve never seen browns do anything like that before…I wish the lake run browns would do that.   Hey Laz...I got that one last Sunday (May 30)...That particular river is notorious for having steelhead in it going into June (and massive swarms of bugs!).  I also got another smaller one just before it.  Both times when they hit, I thought I finally hooked into the brown I was looking for     The fortune cookie said I shouldn’t fish for anything else until I landed a 10lb resident brown…  I think next weekend I’ll be breaking out the carp gear…After I catch my 10lb brown sometime this week  Congrats on the PB"
473568,frozen-fire,2010-06-08 03:39:00,542,You know what I realized? I didn't lose ANY tackle on the outing! Not even a hook!
473603,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-08 10:24:00,1183,I really enjoyed that....great stuff!
473605,mepps,2010-06-08 10:31:00,1301,"Awesome report, beautiful pics!"
473637,rock34,2010-06-08 13:46:00,215,Great report Mike. That is a lot of nice Browns man.  I cant imagine the footwork you put in!  Nicely done.
473647,ctranter,2010-06-08 14:17:00,543,"Great Browns man!  I've recently discovered myself (with a little guidance) just how much bushwacking is needed to find some sweet spots.  These reports keep me entertained through class, keep em coming!"
473648,MJL,2010-06-08 14:25:00,2427," That’s because you crossed the river to get it spooking all of the fish  I probed the log jams to their fullest extent...GO FOR THE GLORY!    The footwork and bushwhacking is all part of the fun…Except for the poison ivy…I accidentally tripped into some of that which was downright scary...I vividly remember thinking ""things are going to get worse before they get better"""
473657,msp,2010-06-08 14:56:00,1336,Roses are red and violets are blue..... Nobody catches browns like YOU !
