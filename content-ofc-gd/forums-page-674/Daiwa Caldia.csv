473682,frozen-fire,2010-06-08 16:06:00,542,What do you anglers think of the Daiwa Caldia that was recently on sale at BPS?  I hear it's a better and smoother reel than the Shimano Stradic. I just wanted to hear some of your opinions as I'm sure some of you picked a few up.
473727,EC1,2010-06-08 19:13:00,930,"From what I know, it's a JDM Daiwa S O L(Dont know why it turns to be outta luck without the spacing). Handled it once, and it's pretty awesome.  For anyone that bought 2 out there, I'll definitely be willing to pay you more than what you paid for it"
473758,mbac31,2010-06-08 20:35:00,904,I have several of them and they are sweet reels for sure. Little better than the outta luck IMO. I have both and the Caldia is much smoother.
473811,Bernie66,2010-06-08 22:15:00,123,"  I bought the 2000 size. 8.1oz, paired it up with my 7'2 crucial drop-shot. Perfect combo. Light and sweet."
