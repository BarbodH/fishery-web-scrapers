473259,SlowPoke,2010-06-07 14:13:00,2984,"Those are nice reviews Roy. For $100, I think I'd jump on it. Never tried the Cruxis myself orther than handling them in the store but they have a nice feel for the retail price."
473265,Lunker777,2010-06-07 14:28:00,866,"Thanks guys !!!  After reading the reviews I think I will jump on these reels.... Hell, if I dont like them, I could always sell them for what I bought them for !"
473272,Oktravis,2010-06-07 14:53:00,62,i owned one of those reals and loved it.was the first decent bait caster i owned.it is not the best quality shimano makes but i abused it for 3 years and it never let me down.i would still be using it if i didn't loose it in cooks bay last year.it has been discontinued and replaced with the citica that i have now.i still miss that real.for that price you cant go wrong  travis
473283,Garry2Rs,2010-06-07 15:28:00,1425,"If you are going to spend $100.00 on a baitcaster, why not put it toward a better reel? These are plastic semi-toys, meant for beginners or once a year fishermen. A used Curado would cost about the same and last you a lifetime. Garry2R's"
473286,Lunker777,2010-06-07 15:46:00,866," Pay closer attention to the post. TWO reels for $100 Im not new to this game...I know these reels arent Curados or Abu premieres..... But for $50 a pop.... why not ?  I had a ""plastic toy"" Abu Black max(bottom of the barrel Bait caster from Abu $20 on ebay )... I just sold it to a buddy and that reel had been put through more crap then anything and still worked GREAT !!!!  Thanks for your input though !!"
