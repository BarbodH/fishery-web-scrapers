473371,splashhopper,2010-06-07 20:35:00,2931,"that is a great way to honor your mom and her battle with a vicious disease Stoty.  In times like these, I am comforted by a prayer that reminds me of my place on this earth:  ""Lord make me a channel of thy peace -- that where there is hatred, I may bring love -- that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness -- that where there is discord, I may bring harmony -- that where there is error, I may bring truth -- that where there is doubt, I may bring faith -- that where there is despair, I may bring hope -- that where there are shadows, I may bring light -- that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.  Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted -- to understand, than to be understood -- to love, than to be loved.  For it is by self-forgetting that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life...""  Splashhopper"

She had a massectomy and all her treatments but now struggles with lymphodemea which makes her right arm and hand very swollen. She is managing now but it has been tough on her. She is a principal at an elementry school and just last week decided she would no longer wear her wig. She now has white curly hair. the students were shocked. If I told her I was gonna get a tattoo in her honour she'd live longer then I would 'cause she'd kill me. I grew up without a dad she she is my everything. I wish you and your family strength. Never let her love die.  Take care captain.  Blair"
