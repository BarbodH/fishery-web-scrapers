473799,BillM,2010-06-08 21:35:00,17367,"Wayne, if I'm ever down that way I'll definitely take you up on your offer.  I've never even BEEN in a bass boat, how sad it that?  lol"
473874,walleyemen,2010-06-09 00:32:00,316,"Anytime you get down this way ,just p.m me, and i own both a bass boat and a cracker, i think we'll stick with the bassboat!"
473894,BillM,2010-06-09 01:12:00,17367," Nice!  I lived in St.Catharines for 26 years before moving up here to Barrie.  Fished Erie quite a bit with the oldman for smallmouth.   Wasn't very popular back then, which was nice"
473898,fish-miester,2010-06-09 01:22:00,864,"I just got back from Huntsville area fishing for pike and walleye, my buddy knows the lake semi well and has caught pike off the docks and we were casting at docks and catching pike.. me fishing the kawartha's all the time I was a little skeptical about dock fishing.. aka normally would catch bass.. though I have caught 2 Musky from under docks.. and the same dock more then once..  but like you Bill I go into MNR mode too when I see people who look like they are bass fishing"
473903,BillM,2010-06-09 01:25:00,17367," I'm no angel, I've caught my fair share of oos bass this season while fishing for pike.  But it's not to hard to figure out where the bass are and avoid those spots in the future.  What gets me is nailing two largies in 14ft of water with weeds about half way up..  Personally I think they were already done with the spawn, which is a really great sign."
473961,perchslayer666,2010-06-09 04:18:00,280,"Ladies, ladies please... Your now whining about what type of boat you see someone fishing from???? I guess it's just that time of the month eh?"
472896,BillM,2010-06-06 05:03:00,17367,"Got a nice surprise today while out fishing for pike.  Decided that even though the weather wasn't looking the best, I'd take my chances.  Glad I did!!  The barometer was dropping and the fish were going crazy.  I went 15/20 on pike, a few oos bass and this good looking fellow!   Hit a slashbait (Rapala XRap XRD-10 in pearl white) in about 14ft of water, weeds at half way up.  This lake isn't known for it's walleye population, so this was a real treat.   26in on the tape, he was released to fight another day.  "
472897,irishfield,2010-06-06 05:08:00,26272,Very nice Bill !
472898,BillM,2010-06-06 05:13:00,17367,"Thanks Wayne, now if I could only find those suckers out of Port Severn I'd be set!"
472902,solopaddler,2010-06-06 09:46:00,8605,"Right on buddy, nice fish!  (And a nice little warm up for next week.  )"
472926,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-06 12:01:00,0,Sounds like some good steady action. That is a healthy looking pickerel!
472989,BillM,2010-06-06 14:27:00,17367, I've been counting the days man!!!!!
472990,Terry,2010-06-06 14:34:00,14456,Nice going
473000,MCTFisher9120,2010-06-06 14:55:00,3761,"You don't hear of to many C&R walleye reports on here anymore  Glad you released that fish man!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
473013,Bly,2010-06-06 15:13:00,1556,Beauty Bill!
473045,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-06 16:56:00,1362,Nice eye BillM...
473104,TDunn,2010-06-06 23:04:00,680,Great walleye Bill!   TDunn
473113,BillM,2010-06-06 23:40:00,17367," Mike, someone's gotta do it!!!     I'd like to think at least 99% of my fish are released (sans a few whities from Simcoe and some small chromers from Lake Erie during steelhead season)  I also saw 3 guys in a nice bassboat tossing small body baits at every dock they could find.  I'm sure they were fishing for pike...    :rolleyes:"
473120,cpguy29,2010-06-07 00:01:00,148,Thats a nice looking fish!
473125,johnl,2010-06-07 00:35:00,197,sweet walleye glad to hear it's still swimming
473127,tibbs,2010-06-07 00:43:00,650,Nice Job Bill!  Sounds like you had a great day.
473158,MJL,2010-06-07 02:10:00,2427,Nice catch Bill
473183,Cudz,2010-06-07 02:45:00,2652,Fishing for sun fish and rock bass no doubt. ps nice fish
473194,corvette1,2010-06-07 03:09:00,1765,nice eye bill
473237,walleyemen,2010-06-07 12:57:00,316,Would ones opinoions change if they were in a tinny?Just saying!!! Unless you know 100% you shouldn't slam guyz in bass boats or anyone for that matter!Just saying!! Nice walter Bill! I caught 3 over 7 pounds on opener in Quinte.... in my bass boat!
473337,FLEX ROD,2010-06-07 18:27:00,394,"Nice fish Bill, as Solo said just a primer for next week.  And yes, I too am counting the days, July 3rd my son and I will up at Eddie's"
473396,irishfield,2010-06-07 22:00:00,26272, Exactly Wayne. As a matter of fact.. my best Lake Temagami Pike and Pickeral have been caught right beside my own dock! They like eating what hides in the cribs tooooo ...
473466,BillM,2010-06-08 01:05:00,17367," I don't care if they were in a kayak, tossing docks for 'pike' with 2in bodybaits on the first Saturday in June paints a pretty clear picture  Everyone knows where the pike are this time of year, it's really no secret.  It's not like they were rubes either, so I can't even buy the excuse that they had no idea what they were doing.  But whatever, everything I saw them catch (none of them were pike) went all back in the lake.  The opening/closing of bass season is a debate for another thread"
473572,Cudz,2010-06-08 04:17:00,2652,Were you pitchin docks for those big eyes? Just sayin.
473576,walleyemen,2010-06-08 05:01:00,316,"No but they did come in 4-10 feet of water along the shore line, they were still spawning, and yes i have pitched docks for pike , when site fishing them, my only gripe is that it alway seems to be a guy in a bass boat, maybe they were, maybe they were not!bottom line is no one knows for sure, and if they were then one should have taken the vessel i.d and reported it, i,m all for the regs and conservation, but we all have to effectivly do our part,All i was trying to say or state was that because a guy is in bassboat, doesn't mean he is just fishing bass, Look me up this summeer if your down here in niagara this summer and the same for you as well Bill, i would love to take you guyz out for some fishing and some arguemntal conversation to help pass the day, Cheers  Wayne!"
473770,Cudz,2010-06-08 20:48:00,2652,I was out in a bass boat fishing for pike and walleye on Goergian bay.  I wish I could say I was successful at catching them but all we caught was oos bass.  Bassboat=bass.  LoL.  just kidding.
