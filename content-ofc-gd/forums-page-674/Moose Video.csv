We killed 5 hours together yesterday on a lake searching for a 5# plus brookie to take a few pics with. Although we caught fish, no trophies were landed but we did manage to get up close and personal with this small cow using an electric motor. This is the 3rd time it has been seen on the lake this year.....  Moose Video    Dinner......    I hope you enjoyed the moose video,  TDunn"
