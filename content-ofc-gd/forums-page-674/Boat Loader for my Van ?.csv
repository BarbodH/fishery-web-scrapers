473177,splashhopper,2010-06-07 02:39:00,2931,"Well, I passed the boaters exam this weekend at the Midwestern Ontario sportsman show in Walkerton. ( what else do u do when it's raining cat's and dogs and you happen to be in the neighborhood) And don;t get me even started about a license for an ELECTRIC MOTOR !  So I am now good to go with my ""new to me "" 12 foot tinnie.  It's a little heavier than my Sportspal canoe and I may not always have someone with me to help get it on to the roof of my van. ( I made the 2x4 rails as suggested on an earlier topic)  What is the easiest way to get the boat up on the roof racks without scratching the heck out of the back of the van.  As a few of the guys I have fished with on the board knows here, I am not exactly the tallest guy on the dock.. lol   Any help ( with pics ) is appreciated.  Splashhopper"

473211,archer379,2010-06-07 09:39:00,277, wow thats one slick set up
473218,Fisherman,2010-06-07 11:21:00,7201,What about a small trailer?  Saves the back.

473307,irishfield,2010-06-07 17:13:00,26272,There is nothing you can't build Cast-Away... it's just time and money! lol
473309,scugpg,2010-06-07 17:13:00,1373," I'd be looking at a small trailer as well. I'm thinking about getting a small Jon boat or something and it seems too much trouble to roof top anything.  PM me when you're going out around here, there's a few smaller spots that are great for a small boat."
