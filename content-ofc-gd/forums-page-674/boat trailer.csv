473421,Hawg Hunter,2010-06-07 23:15:00,204,"hey all bought a northlander trailer and old lad could not find ownership,so my ? to you all is how do i transfer it????  Hawg Hunter"
473428,irishfield,2010-06-07 23:29:00,26272,"You are going to need declarations of ownership signed in front of a Notary.. from HIM !  ..or the easier method, with licence plate in hand, get him to go to the licence bureau and get a new ownership. Then you can go in with that one and the bill of sale and transfer it."
473429,canuckjack,2010-06-07 23:34:00,121," Had the same thing when I bought my boat last fall...the guy was selling it for his dad and they had no idea where the ownership for the trailer was, he'd had the boat for many, many years and that piece of paper was long gone.  ***disclaimer I dunno what the proper way to do this is***  but he went down to the MTO and stated that he had a home built trailer and got a permit and then signed it over.  I could've done it myself, apparently, and avoided paying tax on the value of the trailer but I didn't want my name on the claim that it was home built.  Might be an option for you."
473437,pikeguy,2010-06-07 23:42:00,195,    go in to the mto tell them that you took 2 trailers and made one out of them you did the work yourself  or tell them its home made and they will give you a plate and ownerships for it  good luck
473452,BUSTER,2010-06-08 00:32:00,1336,  Yip just tell them you made it!

473486,irishfield,2010-06-08 01:44:00,26272,If the guy truly owned it... then it's as easy as my post above! My father-in-law loses the original ownerships for all the sleds about every second year... no big deal.. go in with your RIN number and get new ones from the licence bureau. Same deal on this trailer... have him just go in and get a new ownership. Then get him to sign it over.. use your bill of sale and have it transfered to you. No need to lie.. or find out you have bought stolen property!
473573,pigless,2010-06-08 04:22:00,22,"If the trailer was originally registered under the seller and it's just a matter of him losing the ownership paper, it's easiest just to have him go and get a replacement, then sign the sale portion of it and give it to you. MTO would have a record of it if it was actually registered to him and can give him a replacement copy with proof of ID."
473593,Hawg Hunter,2010-06-08 09:27:00,204,thanks alot ill see what i can do..  Hawg Hunter
473710,Sinker,2010-06-08 18:11:00,8692,There is nothing to getting a new ownership. I just got a new one for my dads trailer..........they didn't even ask if I was him.......LOL.  S.
473713,Fishnwire,2010-06-08 18:23:00,983,The easiest thing is go in to the MOT and tell them you built a trailer from scratch. - Trust me...if the trailer was ever registered they will want to see that registration.
