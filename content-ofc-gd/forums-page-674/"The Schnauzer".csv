474029,Muskieman,2010-06-09 13:44:00,2472,"  My neighbor found out that her dog ( a Schnauzer) could hardly hear, so she took it to the veterinarian. The vet found that the problem was hair in the dog's ears. He cleaned both ears, and the dog could then hear fine. The vet then proceeded to tell the lady that, if she wanted to keep this  from recurring, she should go to the chemist and get some ""Nair"" hair remover and rub it in the dog's ears once a month.  The lady went to the chemist and bought some ""Nair"" hair remover.  At the register, the pharmacist told her, ""If you're going to use this under your arms, don't use deodorant for a few days.""  The lady said, ""I'm not using it under my arms.""  The pharmacist said, ""If you're using it on your legs, don't shave for a couple of days.""  The lady replied, ""I'm not using it on my legs either.  If you must know, I'm using it on my Schnauzer.""  The pharmacist says, ""Well stay off your bicycle for about a week.""  :rofl2:  RFS "
