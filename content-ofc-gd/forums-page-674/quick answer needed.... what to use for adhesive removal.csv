473308,bow slayer,2010-06-07 17:13:00,1074,need to remove some old adhesive from a vecro strip on aluminum door. Is there a product out there that will make this easier than scraping. Maybe something that will soften the glue and break it down some to make it easier to scrap off?    please post if you know something that will work. thanks

473333,tb4me,2010-06-07 18:12:00,3295,goo gone works well but goof off works best. Gasline antifreeze works well too.wd 40 does ok too
473342,wkrp,2010-06-07 18:54:00,656,"Try some "" acetone""available at any hardware store"
473360,Burtess,2010-06-07 20:12:00,901,Also Zippo lighter fluid....  Burt
473361,Nanook,2010-06-07 20:12:00,565,A good old standby is cigarette lighter fuel. Works for me many times
473362,shane,2010-06-07 20:15:00,652,I've always had good luck with Isopropyl alcohol.
473365,splashhopper,2010-06-07 20:24:00,2931, I second that one

473391,Governator,2010-06-07 21:49:00,879,Another vote for googone although you still gotta put some elbow grease in to it.
473392,irishfield,2010-06-07 21:49:00,26272,"Yes acetone works in some situations.. but when it comes to glue residue I find that the best thing is reducer 9 times out of 10. It's also fairly friendly to (well cured) painted surfaces. A couple wipes with reducer and it will be gone.... Acetone will take a bit more work if it's been there for any time period bowslayer.. but like others have said, easy to source (unless you have a body shop around the corner and show up with a little jar!)  Goo Gone... If find is basically useless for anything that has any age to it.  Lighter fluid.. is the best thing on vinyl and acrylic or polycarbinate sheet / windshields. Great for heel scuffs on that expensive kitchen floor!"
473406,JohnF,2010-06-07 22:22:00,3494,Peanut butter for some paper adhesives like price tags?  JF
473408,tknohpy,2010-06-07 22:42:00,162,3M adhesive remover.  You can pick it up at a car parts store.  It is expensive but man does it work!
473569,bow slayer,2010-06-08 03:40:00,1074,"thanks for the replies,wife had some goo gone lying around ,tried it, work great"
473611,vince.bornais,2010-06-08 11:10:00,50,"Ronson lighter fluid(yellow plastic bottle) works wonders. Removes car dealer stickers (or any sticker you need removed), tree sap, etc, etc,.... and is fairly inexpensive to buy."
