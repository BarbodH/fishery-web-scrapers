473708,Fish Farmer,2010-06-08 18:06:00,2234,"Had a great time with the boys. Three of our guys drove up from Nova Scotia. We didn't get lots of fish, but it was fun working for them. We got about 50 Walleye for the week which gave us a couple good fish fries, man are they good fresh. Just a few pictures for your enjoyment.    This was a 2 day catch for 8 guys. Picture taken going to the filleting shack while the other boy's were on a supply run to town ;D.  Biggest fish for the week was 21 1/2""                                   This is what we saw before heading back to the cottage every night.   This is just one of our secret spots.  As I said you have to work for your fish, but thats part of fishing. 1/4 to 3/8 oz jig with a night crawler was our arsenal that did the trick, plus lots of snags ;D"
473716,bare foot wader,2010-06-08 18:46:00,1354,great post...looks like a solid time....which big gull are you on? NE of Peterborough...that one building looks like it's at the Kirk's Cover marina?  did you just target walleyes? pretty big musky roaming around in the depths there....
473742,fishnsled,2010-06-08 19:55:00,3520,Nice report Dave. Too bad the fishing wasn't better but always nice to hangout with some good friends for a few days.
473759,fishfarmer2,2010-06-08 20:38:00,76,YEP looks like a fantastic big fish hunt .I missed that trip to some problems i have to get resolve . I will not miss this (Fish-Hunt ) again ok {Guys-&-gals}Thanks
473768,Joey,2010-06-08 20:43:00,9122,"Great report, love the pictures.  I haven't been to Gull Lake in a few years, I miss it.  Joey"
473850,fish-miester,2010-06-08 23:49:00,864,"Hey Fish Farmer! I was out there the same weekend as you guys, I mainly stuck to the small Bay on the west side of the lake by ""Cuddies"" and well didnt get nearly as much fishing done as I wanted but had a great time with good friends! and well we caught a hole bunch of little pike off the dock as well out of my 14'"
473863,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-09 00:06:00,1362,Looks like a great time had by all!!....nice pics..
473873,Fish Farmer,2010-06-09 00:30:00,2234," Yes you got it bare foot, the resort is Kirk Kove Cottages, towns close by are Kaladar & Northbrook. We've been going there for 7 years now. Owners Jim & Clare are very nice people. We don't target Muskie, season is closed. If I could go more often, I mite give them a try but I've been bitten off a few times.   You've got that right fishnsled. I'd love to do that trip 2 or 3 times a year. 1 week goes by pretty fast. Too long of a wait for next year. It's a nice lake to have a cottage on, Big Gull is 85% crown land.  Joey Were did you stay? The marina and resort has closed up on the east end of the lake.  Wally, farmer#2 you'll be with us next year buddy"
473878,Rich Clemens,2010-06-09 00:40:00,3131,Sweet report.  Looks to be some real nice scenery there as well.  Good Times.
473885,Fish Farmer,2010-06-09 00:47:00,2234,"Joey were did you stay. The marina and resort has closed up on the east end of the lake.    fish-meister, to bad we didn't meet up. You must have stayed on little Gull west end. You have to go through the narrows to Big Gull. Mostly Bass and Pike west end. We don't fish west Gull, we mostly fish the deeper part of the lake on the shoals. If your there again when we are, we have FRS radios we talk on between our group."

473891,irishfield,2010-06-09 01:09:00,26272,"GREAT stuff Dave!!  You sure that you're not still a working man, because retired folks don't have time for this much fishing!!!"
473998,Fish Farmer,2010-06-09 12:38:00,2234, Your right Wayne. Just came home long enough to do some chores and heading out Perching tomorrow then doing a Crappie derby Sunday. Not enough days in a week. I just picked up my Spiel custom made rod. Now I've got to get him to show me how it works on Whities........ Chris I hope you read this...Hint Hint Hint.
474008,Spiel,2010-06-09 13:08:00,9065,"Yeah, I'm reading it Dave. I'm only here now to take a break from lathing a cork handle and wash the cork dust out of my throat with a cold one.  I have just enough time between now and Lakair to finish a couple of more rods so I'm afraid Simcoe Whities are not possible.  Perhaps I'll find time to go to Big Gull next year though.    Looks like a lot of fun!"
