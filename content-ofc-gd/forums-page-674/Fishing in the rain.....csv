473380,splashhopper,2010-06-07 21:17:00,2931,"Well this weekend was all but a total washout.... rain rain rain and more rain.  Nice to fall asleep in the back of my van with the sound of the rain hitting the rooftop though.  One helluva wind for awhile Saturday night with that rain too.... it actually woke me up.  Tried fishing for pike all day Saturday and a little Sunday morning.  Got one small one about 20"" long... didn;t bother taking a pic either.. lol  On the way home, i decided to stop in to a little town and try for a carp or two...  Tried the worms... no luck.... tried bread... no luck...  Put 5 pieces of corn on the hook with three small splits shots on and KAPOW !  I get this one   Two young kids( 12 years old) came over to my side of the river to see what I caught it on... we soon had them rigged up with corn and small hooks too,  Each of them lost "" the biggest fish of their life"" within 15 minutes!  They are hooked on corn now,, and live two blocks from this hole.   Right after they left I got in to this brute ( thank goodness a family just came down to try for rock bass and took a pic for me)     All in all I drove 90 minutes(each way for some pike action and only had a small reward) and then stop in 30 minutes from home and get rewarded with some carpin fun!  Gotta love the tug of good sized carp  :whistling:  ."
473383,Marko,2010-06-07 21:23:00,854,Nice fish! I noticed that fish is missing a chunk of its upper lip must be from smashing in the wall or something. Rain completely ruined my weekend as well. Other then 30 pounds of weeds i got nothing.
473434,splashhopper,2010-06-07 23:40:00,2931, I didn't even notice that snout till u pointed it out
473449,hammercarp,2010-06-08 00:18:00,964,WTG! That was great of you to show those kids how to have fun catching carp.
473507,MJL,2010-06-08 02:09:00,2427,Nice catches Splash...Good on you for showing the kids the awesomeness of the carp  I've done similar things driving 2-3hrs in search of carp only to get into a bunch 15mins from home on the way back.
473509,splashhopper,2010-06-08 02:16:00,2931, I drove 90 minutes for some Pike action... I am lucky in that I can get in to carp action about 5 minutes from my house in the Thames river here in London... but what fun would that be sleeping in my van in a parking lot next to the Labatt's brewery
473553,alphaalpha,2010-06-08 03:03:00,475,Too bad the pike didn't co-operate much but at least you got into some nice fish.  I wish i could always finish off a trip like that!
473701,fishermccann,2010-06-08 17:17:00,655,"I know how you feel. I live on Lake Ontario between Duffins creek and the Rouge river, two of the best carp streams east of T.O. It is great to be 5 min. from home for some after-work fishing action.Good luck to you."
473719,bow slayer,2010-06-08 18:58:00,1074,that spot looks to be the home of albino squirrels
473724,TC1OZ,2010-06-08 19:07:00,987,Looks like fun! Thanks for the report!
473738,fishnsled,2010-06-08 19:38:00,3520,Up until a couple of years ago I never would have even considered fishing for carp. Gave it a go with with a couple of OFNer's and got 2 brutes in one evening and was hooked. Fun way to kill a couple of hours. Nice report.
473803,splashhopper,2010-06-08 21:45:00,2931, might have seen one of those that day too
