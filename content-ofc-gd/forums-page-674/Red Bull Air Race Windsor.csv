473681,Roy,2010-06-08 16:04:00,13728,Wayne does that all the time. He likes to write his name on virgin lakes with his wing tips.
473691,irishfield,2010-06-08 16:31:00,26272,"Roy!!  Thank God for (top rudder and) HORSEPOWER ..or he'd be a swimmer!  Most, probably even me, would have ended up upside down before hitting the water. A lot of military training (read tax dollars ! LOL) paid off big time there!"
