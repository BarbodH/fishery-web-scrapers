473001,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-06 14:55:00,0, Yes that's it!!! A bittern. I looked for a recording on the net but couldn't find it. The noise they make sounds more electronic than natural.
473005,kickingfrog,2010-06-06 15:04:00,8333,Belted kingfishers also make an interesting/unusual noise.
473007,laszlo,2010-06-06 15:07:00,487,Not a squirrel for sure. More scratchy and screetchy. I think it's a deer.

473064,big guy,2010-06-06 18:26:00,414,"Heard something years ago on the farm that sounded like this and believe it or not it turned out to be 2 porcupines up in a tree. My guess is that it's a sound they make during the mating ritual.  I would never have guessed that the sound I heard would come from a porcupine, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if that's what you heard."

473266,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-07 14:30:00,932,"I live in a Blue-Jay infested forest and they make some obscene, high-pitched, throat clearing noises, but I don't think that is what your caller is.  I was at my GF's brother's place this weekend and he has a pool.  Frogs always get caught on the tarp that covers the pool.  They SCREAM this exact noise that you are describing, sometimes you get 6 of them screaming it at once.  It sounds like the noise should be coming from something much, much bigger, but it is just frogs.  That's where my money is."

473666,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-08 15:14:00,0, Great site. I found this but the sound I hear is even more stranger than this one!  http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/33/_/American_Bittern.aspx
473669,Harrison,2010-06-08 15:19:00,2202," My first thought.. and solid description!  Maybe a deer, but I think it sounds more like a snort/whine.  Scares the snot out of ya in pitch black and dead quiet walking to your stand I tell ya!"
473699,bigfish1965,2010-06-08 17:09:00,3382,"The noises we heard were from the trees and seemed to move so it points to either some migratory owl or other bird. I remember the noise, similar to a screech owl but more 'throaty'. They were around for a few weeks and camouflage very well, whatever they were. Worst noise i have heard this year so far is from what I assume was an owl snatching a rabbit into a tree and having a hard time killing it. Now i know why the predator calls work so well."

473975,laszlo,2010-06-09 10:37:00,487," That's the closest I've heard so far but more high pitched and everytime I hear it, the sound is only made once."
472907,laszlo,2010-06-06 11:12:00,487,"For the last few years, every spring when I walk my dog in the ravine, I hear this sound come from the forest and I have no clue what it is. I suspect it's a bird of some kind.  The only way I can describe it: Loud, somewhat higher pitched screetch, that last about 2 seconds. It sounds like it's done from the throat. I've never been able to spot the source.  Any clue???  Thanks."
472908,solopaddler,2010-06-06 11:14:00,8605,Owl? Who knows?
472910,Chris,2010-06-06 11:16:00,405,Blue Jay?
472911,Terry,2010-06-06 11:16:00,14456,well without hearing it......  it could be a frog or owl  ..........  I knew a girl......never mind
472913,Roy,2010-06-06 11:30:00,13728,It's either a hawk or someone looking at his first Telus bill.
472914,laszlo,2010-06-06 11:32:00,487,"The only other way I could describe it, is as if your clearing your throat, but very fast and higher pitched.  I'm guessing it's a hawk or owl. Do cormorants make a sound like that?"
472915,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-06-06 11:34:00,1362,Crows can make some pretty wierd sounds too...

472918,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-06 11:45:00,0,"Dont know but when I rented a boat from Walleye man on sparrow lake, we heard this sound and it sounded computer generated. Nothing like I have ever heard before. He told me it was a bird. Dont remember the name of the bird but apperently it makes some noise from deep within its chest, possibly a mating call but this sound is just unreal. I think the bird's name starts with a B."
472927,Chris,2010-06-06 12:02:00,405,"  If it sounds similar to a fart it could be a ""brown-eyed warbler"""
472936,dave524,2010-06-06 12:39:00,4508,"I'm betting on a Blue Jay too, they have one call they make that I swear sounds identical to the creaking of a clothesline pulley when my Mom used to hang out clothes when I was a kid, about the same interval between calls too as hanging clothes. Your desciption kinda sounds like that call."
472938,dave524,2010-06-06 12:42:00,4508," That would be the call of a Bittern, I used to be a park naturalist at Long point Prov. Park in my younger days, fielded that query more than a few times."
472939,DRIFTER_016,2010-06-06 12:43:00,10439,Sounds like the mating call of the Eastern Samsquench.

472958,Jewelbee,2010-06-06 13:31:00,422,"You know....I hear the in my neck of the woods too and have always wondered about it. Rick and I tried to figure it out from listening on-line to bird and insect noises, but, no luck. I guess it will remain a mystery for now. If you figure it out, let me know. I'm curious in Niagara!"
472965,wankerjohn123,2010-06-06 13:43:00,117,Probably my wife..... sorry for the noise.
472966,laszlo,2010-06-06 13:45:00,487,There are plenty of deer behind my place so that's a strong possibility. Then again there are plenty of almost all animals mentioned above.  I guess the mystery remains until I see this critter in the act of making this call.

472998,hammercarp,2010-06-06 14:52:00,964,A female fox. If it's in the spring she'll have kits in a den and they make that noise as an alarm and to scare off intruders.
