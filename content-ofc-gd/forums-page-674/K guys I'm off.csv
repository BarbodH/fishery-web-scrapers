Please tell him to update his web site as his recent monthly report was from July of 2009. Another pointer you could tell him is perhaps a map or directions on how to get there. The only way I could tell he was in Kenora was through his mailing address. Ironically, on the contact me page he even left out Kenora in the mailing address. Then there is that dreaded payments in USD funds. Man I hate that, he is in Canada!  Other than that, enjoy your Summer!"
