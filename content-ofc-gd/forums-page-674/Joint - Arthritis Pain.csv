473720,jimmer,2010-06-08 18:59:00,2730,"Interesting to see this post and hear about all the treaments you guys are using.  I have suffered with a bad back (surgery) since I was 25 years old, bad hips for the past 4 years as well as knees and shoulders (I'm 52).  I have tried many of those mentioned including celebrex and the natural ones.  Some would show a little relief, but not enough to let me sleep through the night or enjoy regular activities.  I see a chiropractor every three weeks.  I'm not always one to listen to my doctor for my own reasons, but last year I visited him after weeks of relentless pain.  I was taking celebrex at the time and it just wasn't cutting it.  He mentioned taking tylenol arthritis daily might help.  Well, low an behold, it is the best advice I could have received.  I have better sleeps, no hip pain, better shoulders and no gut rot.  Who would have thought that buying something off the shelf would provide a better relief than prescrition drugs."

473991,fisher,2010-06-09 12:11:00,451,"Yes, PENNSAID is via prescription-covered by all insurance companies if you have it.  Otherwise, I believe it is about $60-$70 a bottle and that is for about a month's supply but I find you can stretch it to 2 months as you do not have to use as much as the bottle says.  But start off with the recommended dosage and modify from there.  While the warnings on the package are the same as oral Nsaids, it has more to do with the class of drug that it is in rather than the likelyhood of them happening with Pennsaid as compared to say Celebrex.  In fact, a study concluded that the amount of the nsaid that gets into your blood/system from using Pennsaid is something like 100 times less than the pill Nsaids taken orally.  Makes sense since it doesn;t go through your whole body.  Let us know how it works out if you get it.   Here is an article I found regarding toxicity of Pennsaid vs oral medication... Topical diclofenac has equal efficacy to, less toxicity than oral diclofenac for knee OA   Oct 15, 2004  Ottawa, ON - A topical diclofenac solution (Pennsaid, Dimethaid Health Care Ltd, Markham, ON) was as effective as oral diclofenac and much less toxic for treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in a randomized, controlled trial reported by Dr Peter S Tugwell (University of Ottawa, ON) et al in the October 2004 issue of the Journal of Rheumatology [ 1 ].  Our equivalence study showed that topical diclofenac was as effective as the maximum daily dose of oral diclofenac in relieving knee osteoarthritis symptoms.

472601,Dutchy,2010-06-04 20:30:00,416," Unfortunately that is your only real option. My lab does some research on osteoarthritis and it is progressive so not much you can do about it in the long run. Despite what you might read, there is no cure or really effective treatment other than joint replacement.  Medical grade weed is supposed to be effective, but you need to talk to you doctor about that one. It does relieve pain."
472603,TC1OZ,2010-06-04 20:34:00,987," In no way do I think it would cure his issue, but at least life would be manageable with no pain. Talk to your doctor if you are just ""living"" with it and doing nothing to treat the suffering!!!"
472606,Dutchy,2010-06-04 20:41:00,416," I wasn't even referring to your post. I was simply stating the current knowledge on OA and treatment. Its very hard to get rid of the pain depending on how severe the condition has become which is where joint replacement comes in. Many pain medications are a no go long term because they have several other side effects, some of which include heart damage. So learning to live with it is something you have to do.  Now that I click the link in your post, yes, that is what I was saying. I was being serious, weed is an option for OA, they write prescriptions for it for OA sufferers everyday."

His surgery is scheduled for the 23rd of this month... I'll be escorting him again to translate and comfort him, during surgery ""patient must be concious""  :blahblah1:  He ended up with a Rx for Synthetic Marijuana THC pills ""Marinol""  or the option of ""Medical Marijuana"".

472618,addymark,2010-06-04 21:33:00,69,Glucosamine sulfate is better than chondroitin sulfate because glucosamine is more readily absorbed than chondroitin.  there have been multiple studies that had glucosamine compared with NSAIDS.  these studies have shown no significant difference between the two products except that there are a lot less gastric ulcers as compared to nsaids.  i would also recommend a fish oil product that contains DHA and EPA.  these are fatty acids that will naturally decrease inflammatory prostaglandins.

Went back to work and it is still painful. Went through a set of 3 synvisc shots at 455 bucks for some temporary relief. Supposed to have them every 6 months but the cost is hefty and my insurance pays just once a year but I am thankful for even that. Six weeks ago I had a cortisone shot and it felt almost new for about 5 weeks. Had another one this week and it feels pretty good until the end of a working day. At least it's easier to get up and go down stairs, but cortisone is not a solution.

Celebrez, is a pill and consequently goes through your entire system to treat the issue but it can cause stomach ulcers/bleeds, heart issues.  Pennsaid instead is applied on the skin over the site of the problem.  Although specifically indicated for the knee, your doctor can prescribe for other areas of your body. I have used it in the past even for my badly stubbed toe.  It will work!  Also, it is the only topical NSAID that has passed through FDA/Health Canada and also met the WOMAC study endpoints (a measure of the effectiveness of the treatment).  Pennsaid.ca  or Pennsaid.com"
