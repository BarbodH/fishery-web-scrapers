472867,Big Cliff,2010-06-06 01:53:00,6899," You are very right, and to be honest with you until the neighbour started trying to cause them all kinds of problems ""stopping them from going on land they thought was theirs"" (we won't go into all the details) and just started being a jerk in general, the kids wouldn't have cared a bit. Live and let live! Right now, they aren't out to sue anyone, they just want things straightened out properly. They bought a piece of property in good faith. Turns out that the neighbour that tried to give them a hard time built his house on their property. All they want to do is find out what their legal rights are and get this mess resolved. They paid for 90 acres of land, they pay their taxes on 90 acres of land, I think it is only fair that they should be allowed to use their 90 acres of land.     With regard to turning this into something nasty and sueing everyone and their brother, forget it, we aren't that kind of people. If the neighbour is at fault here the only thing the kids want is a fair resoulation. They are not ready to run a bulldozer through his house, they have no desire to burn it to the ground, but if they are entitled to some compensation, then that is all they would like, that and the neighbour to back off and let them live their lives in peace."
472880,SlowPoke,2010-06-06 02:26:00,2984," I see your point but; if for example they had purchased a 200x400 property and lost 30' to the neighbour, you might not notice that by eye and up being out a substantial amount of property. Or, they may have assumed they owned an equal portion of property opposite to the encroachment belonging to the other neighbour."
472883,Twocoda,2010-06-06 02:38:00,4130,seriously ...if the neighbour built his house on their land ...hand him an eviction notice...  i honestly dont see how this could possibly happen if it is a new build..permits would have to been approved by the municipality for the build..placing the proposed house on a survey of the land...  if he had a permit for it ...then chances are its his land based on the survey and house placement...if he encroached too close to his property line ...he will have to get a variance...1200 $ and a municipal  meeting ....this is where the kids get to go and contest the issue...regardess its goiing to cost him 1200 for the variance   if he just went and built it without a permit ( highly unlikely)...hand him an eviction notice...your land ...your building...and inform him its alot cheaper to walkaway then deal with the fines he is about to get  if he tries to subdivide the piece of property to accomadate his variance ...have him pay for the entire subdivision...4 lots per acre times 90 ....sell em off and buy something elsewhere mortgage free and hassle free  if the issue is a couple of feet of his house on their property... use the exact property line to offset  your new garage/woodworking shop with a drum kit in it and a dust collector blowing in his direction...  dont forget to collect the monthly rent from him...if he doesnt pay EVICT

472950,JohnF,2010-06-06 13:09:00,3494," My apologies to all of you, and particularly Cliff if I appear to be hijacking this thread. I'm actually also working to help Cliff out behind the scenes, at least to the extent I can. But what a thread like this does is allow me to help make a few consumers better informed on the real estate business, and for the cynics that's not to brainwash you into dealing only with Realtors but rather so you can make an informed decision on whether or not you should commit yourself to some aspect of a real estate deal without getting professional advice and/or assistance. Lots of folks are perfectly able to get through it without a Realtor's help but other times peculiar little twists and turns arise that may well come back and bite you in the ass down the road. Most of us in the business have enough loyal clientel that we aren't hurt by the occasional person taking a flyer and dealing privately. Or they get stung just enough that they tell all their friends that they'll never do it solo again. The toughest part for us is when we find ourselves listing the private sale property for the private buyer at a later date and have to explain to the buyer turned seller about the problems they inherited that could have been headed off by dealing with professionals from the outset.  It's just like fixing your own car engine, or cutting out your own ingrown toenails, or putting your own roof on your house. Lots of folks can do it without hiring a pro but will the amateur work come back to bite them in the ass later?  I could on and on (and seem to have) about this but I'll stop now because this is a fishing site not a real estate site.  But one last thing BB. And this is a good example of how the average consumer is misinformed about real estate in our world. Read this site http://www.dos.state.ny.us/lcns/realestate/1736.htm and with the exception of what appears to be some kind of limited agency and sub-agency definitions in there it sounds to me that in NY the rules are essentially the same as here in Ontario. You have buyer agency, seller agency and dual agency with the same fiduciary dutires and exceptions to service in dual agency. We just have somewhat different names for it here.  JF"

I didn't have to read beyond this statement in the Sellers Agent section: ""A sellerâ€™s agent does not represent the interests of the buyer""as this is what I was referring to previously....  I only purchased 2 properties and sold one in my experiences but I will have to say that ""HERE"" I had bad experiences with PART TIME Real Estate Agents...I felt I did much more work then they did and yet they collected commission$ because of my efforts....but that's another story in itself......what's important here is that Cliff's children problems are resolved and that heavy burden on their shoulders are lift...But I have a feeling you have the situation under control and they are already sleeping better since you have gotten involved...God Bless You.

472985,JohnF,2010-06-06 14:09:00,3494, Thanks BB but the situation with the kids is not mine to control. I'm just trying to help out a little by getting them on the right track (cuz I know Cliff would do the same thing if he could). The real solution will probably be handled by a good lawyer. All I was doing with that example to you was putting on a little dog and pony show. Sometimes we gotta prove what we can do before folks start to trust us and that's not just about real estate trading.  Just for fun here's another cheap parlour trick - one of us here has a property comprising about 17.58 acres that sits on a point on the north shore of a lake about 5 kms west (slightly south) of the nearest town. I could post how much was paid for it but it's kinda involved with two different parcels apparently purchased on the same day. The deed refers to a forfeiture of mining rights which I suspect is fairly common for the area. Guess who. Of course I won't say who it is even if you get it right.  JF
473048,irishfield,2010-06-06 17:04:00,26272,When you see that up North John it's usually the Minister of Northern Developement Mines forfeiting their rights.. giving the owner full use of the property.

473124,fish_fishburn,2010-06-07 00:21:00,1311,"Hi John. I found metes and bounds quit interesting in phase II. I was a surveyor for eight years back in the 80's. I worked on large engineering projects like building hiways through the rockies and doing bridge work and working in quarries and large gravel pits. I had never had any experience in property surveys as I was always led to believe there was no money in it. I had to read it (metes and bounds) a few times before I understood it and can see how frustrating it would be to someone without any surveying background. I think I will buy a metal detector and a 100ft cloth tape to add to my tools of the trade, so I can verify myself if there is any doubt."
473126,fish_fishburn,2010-06-07 00:42:00,1311,"As far a building permits go. When I built my double garage (28X32) on my property I applied for a building permit and the first inspection before I could even pour the slab was to have the placement verified by the building inspector. He came with his tape and measured my setbacks to make sure they were in accordance with the by-laws. He also made sure my slab was above the centerline grade of the street before giving me the green light to proceed. This really makes me scratch my head and wonder how this mess could of happened six years ago if the building inspector would of did his job.Maybe a minor variance was granted and the paperwork was lost or misplaced,who knows? Not a situation I would want to be involved in, REALTOR or land owner."
473135,JohnF,2010-06-07 01:11:00,3494,  I agree. Leads one to wonder if there was even a permit taken out. But I've heard that the northern municipalities are a little slacker than our southern planning depts. Hard to believe they're all under the control of the same Planning Act.  JF

473407,JohnF,2010-06-07 22:26:00,3494, I'll defer to your own experience. I'm just going on reports from other northern dwellers. 35 years ago in Stratford I just took in a hand drawn depiction of my pool installation and got the permit no problem. Today I would need a survey and a follow up inspection by the city guys.  JF
473607,Chris,2010-06-08 10:49:00,405," Hehe, I am a design draftsman, mainly mechanical design in factories, but I have done many house plans and renovation drawings over the years, and have done a lot of architectural drawings for industry as well. With the new regs in the Ontario ""building code"" I now cannot do residential drawings for anyone as the gov't. deems me to be unqualified (I only have 35 years experience). You see I would first have to spend approx. $1,000 to take their two Bull courses (technical and legal)then write their two Bull exams. If I pass the exams then I would have to register with the Province of Ontario...but they won't register me without insurance, which is between $6,000 and $8,000/year. But heres the kicker....a homeowner with absolutely NO experience is allowed to draw and submit their own plans. And it's just a scam to get more tax dollars anyway. For example, 4 years ago we put in an above ground pool and a deck. I was allowed to do my own plans as I was, in this case, the homeowner. After the pool/deck was installed they sent an appraisal company to measure and photograph my new deck and my property taxes instantly increased by $240/year. It's not about homeowner protection as they claim, it's about getting more tax dollars. Not a real good incentive for getting a building permit anymore. In the future if I do any home renos inside the home, there will be no building permit involved.  As a side note, with these new Ont. building code regs, the gov't. even wanted professional engineers to get requalified with their Bull program. Well the P.E.O.'s said ""hey it was us engineers who wrote the building code in the first place"" took the gov't. to court and won!  Bunch of pencil-pushers in suits and ties trying to tell people in the design business how to do their job. Looks good on them, although I wonder how many of our tax dollars were spent fighting the P.E.O.'s in court.  End of rant!!!"

472731,JohnF,2010-06-05 13:26:00,3494," I'll put on my teacher hat here because I have the weekend off and I'm relaxing with my second cup of coffee out of a mug instead of a cardboard container.  You're right BB. The survey is often a key ingredient in rural properties. As always, hindsight is 20/20 and in this case would have headed off the problem, or at least informed the kids that the problem existed before they had the title conveyed. In most urban transactions the property lines are generally more obvious and these situations tend not to occur or at least not with problems of the same magnitude.  A Realtor with access to MPAC/Teranet might have been able to help here by looking up the aerial photos of the property if they're even posted and comparing the building positions to the lot outline.  The title search wouldn't likely show anything about this if neither owner knew about it. The reason I asked about Land Titles registration (which is coming to the southerly part of Ontario but was a more common thing in the north) is that properties registered under Land Titles are less susceptible to claims by adverse possession because of the way they are recorded, guaranteed and assured. That being said I'm afraid this may be one of the rare exceptions but it would take lawyers to sort that out.  Finally the Title Insurance may or may not give some relief here. At first glance I'd say possibly not but it may come down more to what damage this does to the encroaching neighbour than to the kids. How's that for confusing. It may help to mitigate the problem or it may not. I don't know for sure. Once in a while I see a settlement by the insurer that confuses me.  But that doesn't mean Title Insurance isn't a good thing. Besides boundary disputes it protects in other ways. Title fraud has become a big deal now with crooks and sometimes crooked lawyers in collusion to register fraudulent mortgages and titles. It's really hard to defend yourself against it so the insurance is a blessing if you are victimized.  If I've explained anything incorrectly here I'd be happy to here from realtors or lawyers who can show me the error of my ways. I'm always willing to learn.  One thing I suggest though is to be very careful in acting on gratuitous advice you receive here or on other similar forums when dealing with significant issues like money, health and property ownership. All the advice is well-intended, but frankly some of it is incorrect or at best only partially correct or even applicable. I get a kick out of watching all the ""AHA moments"" as my real estate licence students figure something out in class or recognize a situation they've encountered as I tell my real life stories to them. ""Is that how that happened?"" is a common response to my explanations as we work through the material. It's obvious that they often didn't understand what they thought they understood as it was happening. There's a lot of work and due diligence done behind the scenes by lawyers & Realtors that the buyers and sellers in the transaction simply aren't aware of and probably wouldn't understand even if it was explained to them. Lawyers spend a long time in school learning some pretty arcane and convoluted stuff that you and I can only wish we actually understood. To a lesser extent we Realtors also spend time learning how to navigate the pitfalls inherent in real property trading. I even have a short course for my own salespeople called ""Red Flags"". It's all about anticipating where the problems are likely to arise for the consumer and how we can head the problems off before our clients get hurt by them.  I'll give you an example that will sound a little obscure but Fish_F should relate after all his studying. Depending on how old the properties involved are the title may include an old metes & bounds description of the property. I just finished teaching my students how to read a M&B description and the prospect of having to know this stuff worries them but they soldier on. It's confusing to say the least because south becomes north etc etc. But if a Realtor knows how he/she can actually pace off the property boundaries from the description and get at least a rough idea of just where the property boundaries are located. I'm kinda anal about this stuff so if I was dealing with a buyer interested in a property that the sellers claimed didn't have a survey or any clear and mutually acknowledged boundary lines I'd probably pull the deed to see what it said.  Fish, there'll be a test later.  End of lesson.  JF"
472788,Big Cliff,2010-06-05 18:23:00,6899,"I guess one of the biggest problems is the cost of a survey especially for first time buyers, I know that in my kids case they had been working and saving for years to be able to buy a place of their own. When this place became available they had two choices, put their money up or miss out on it and wait for another year or two while prices kept going up.  It took every penny they had saved (well mom and dad might have helped a bit with a ""wedding present"") but they managed to scrape enough together to get the place. A survey would have cost them a few thousand more that they just didn't have although in hind sight it probably would have been money well spent but the choice was; get the place or don't.  Fences don't mean anything either, when we bought this place we got a survey done just to be sure. Turns out the fence is actually 2"" inside of our property line and 8"" inside down at the water. Doesn't sound like much if you have a good neighbour but remember water front property is assessed at $1200.00 extra per linear foot. so if you are paying taxes on something your neighbour is using and enjoying?????   I don't think anyone has done anything knowingly wrong here, I find it hard to believe that the neighbour would have knowingly built on their property had he realized it was but wouldn't he have had to get a building permit? I know when I built my boat house I had to show where it was going to be with respect to lot lines and everything, I had to insure it was a minimum 48"" from the lot line. The kids neighbour only built his house about 6 years ago.  Questions aplenty, answers will come in due time!"
472800,JohnF,2010-06-05 19:45:00,3494," You're right about the fences, but the more people there are who think the property line is in a particular place the better the chance that it's close. Even one in disagreement waves the red flag and suggests that further investigation is in order.  And yes, it's surprising the neighbour got away with building so far off the mark assuming he got municipal permits etc. It raises a lot of questions about municipal inspections and construction without proper permits etc. The neighbour may well find himself with lots of problems if he didn't get municipal permission when he built.  It's a crappy situation for the kids but from a purely professional perspective it's a pretty interesting case study. I really hope it works out well for the kids. I'm happy to help however I can.

472815,ScugogBoy,2010-06-05 22:19:00,36,"Mr john (teacher)....why not add into your advice that the Buyer should file a complaint with RECO about the Agent they used to represent them....is it not their duty along with the Selling agent to have verified this type of info? I would file a complaint and have the lawyer sue both Agents and Brokerages involved as they have not done their homework on this property....unfotunately the Agents/Brokerages will have to pay their deductible fee, but ""Errors and Omissions insurance"" will $$$$$ satisfy the Buyer.......what do you think?"
472826,JohnF,2010-06-05 23:21:00,3494," I think I know more facts than you about this deal. You'll have to ask Big Cliff why they aren't starting an action against their agent but they have legitimate reasons that are really their business only.  However, you are correct in general. Any time a consumer feels they have been mistreated by a RECO registrant they have the right to lodge a complaint. It will be investigated thoroughly and if the RECO people feel there's grounds to go further they will assign the case to a tribunal to have a discipline hearing. We are mandated by law to carry very good E&O as well as insurance to protect consumer deposits held in trust and even our own commissions when owed by other brokerages. The great E&O is a blessing and a curse. Even when we aren't absolutely responsible there's a tendency to try to drag us into the action because we have ""deep pockets"".  There are a lot of consumers who refuse to accept their own responsibility or simple bad luck when a deal makes a left turn so they listen when their friends start screaming ""SUE"". For the most part their lawyers help them to see reason and that cuts off a lot of unfounded complaints from going further. Of those that make it to RECO there are quite a number that don't merit discipline and stop there.  By a funny coincidence I'm one of the Ontario registrants currently appointed to the pool from which these panels are chosen. I didn't bother mentioning it before. I think there are about 90 of us across the province. And before you make some comment about how that should guarantee that no one ever gets punished check out the public list of registrants who have received penalties from our panels. Some of them are pretty significant. Look under the Complaints & Enforcement tab on the RECO site.  More details here  http://www.reco.on.ca/  Our industry really has little patience with our own members who don't follow the rules. It's a great system for the consumers' protection.  If you really feel you've been abused criminally by a Realtor you may want to go direct to the courts for civil litigation or to get them punished for some kind of malfeasance (or whatever the legal word is).  If you are having a legal problem with a real estate deal I would hope that your first thought is to get legal advice from a professional. Lawyers are well aware of the various means of recourse available to the consumer. If going to RECO is one of your options I would think your lawyer will point you that way. But in our defence we spend a lot of time in courses learning to do our work legally and ethically, perhaps as much as any kind of business in Ontario and more than most.  Any questions Mr Scugog(Boy)?  JF"

472849,Dara,2010-06-06 00:45:00,3052,"How bout this view.

Now they find that their land may go past where they thought. Why get all upset about it. Find out the real deal, possibly get some compensation from the guy, have the taxes adjusted and be happy with their pretty little farm. Possibly having the neighbor under the gun and giving him an out would make him be a bit nicer too.  I don't know the details but this is just a thought on it."
472861,JohnF,2010-06-06 01:19:00,3494," I'm not familiar with the laws in every state but generally agency law comes down to a fairly standard code. The different states and provinces have imposed some twists and turns in it by way of their respective legislation pertaining to real estate trading. In Ontario we have both seller and buyer representation and either can pay for the Realtor's services. In most cases, however, the commission paid to the listing brokerage is split between the buyer and seller brokerages. In the case where a brokerage puts together a deal for their client on an unlisted property the buyer may pay the brokerage that provided the services.  I believe that I've heard of some states that preclude one brokerage acting as agent for both the buyer and the seller so there are offices that specialize in buyer brokerage only.  JF"
472863,JohnF,2010-06-06 01:30:00,3494," That's exactly the way one of our town's better lawyers always explained things to his clients (while he was alive) when this kind of thing happened. ""What did you think you were buying?"" and I tend to agree.  The problem though (and I don't have enuf details yet) may be that the property line on the other side may also not be where they thought it was and they end up effectively losing a lot of land here, not just a few feet of frontage.  The other and perhaps more serious issue is over liability for injuries, damages etc that may occur at the neighbour's house but are technically happening on their property. Why should they be responsible for that? There's also now the issue of ever trying to sell the property. The situation needs to be resolved and perhaps (probably) the kids are entitled to some form of damages or restitution here.  JF"
472053,Governator,2010-06-03 00:10:00,879,"I would think the neighbour actually has squatters rights in this case.  Basically wern't aware of their property over the line and since it's been there for so long it would remain as is.  Of course if it's a portable building like a shed, that should be removed off the property but a fence, deck, foundation etc. I think is all squatters rights."

This would perhaps be good.  The next thing is to reconsider hiring a local lawyer. Sometimes local lawyers don't like to tackle old time locals, particularly while representing a newcomer, in nasty issues like this. Didn't they use a local lawyer to buy it?  Other than that I have to give this some thought. A lot of things come to mind such as did the sellers know this and not disclose it? Was there an SPIS provided? Was the deal done thru a real estate brokerage? Did they buy Title Insurance as there's a possibility of some help there but I'm not certain. Perhaps best if I PM you later.

Not an easy thing to prove unless they were long term occupants prior to you kids moving in such that they would have to have known.  Also, not sure that a local Sudbury lawyer is what you need. You need someone who specializes in this and knows what they are doing. You might be better looking in TO. Just a thought.  I bought title insurance when I got my property and I was told it would cover things like a mortgage on the property you didn't know about, outstanding work orders against the property, unpaid bills against the property. Basically anything involving the property prior to you being the owner is not your problem. Whether that covers encroachment I don't know.  Good luck Cliff."

ENCROACHMENT AGREEMENT; An agreement permitting the encroachment of an improvement onto the ajoining parcel of land that may be registered against the title of both properties affected by the encroachment.  Application; Under the encroachment agreement the owner whose land has been encroached upon by the improvement essentially forebears from exercising his/her legal right to to require the improvement to be removed from the land. Encroachment agreements are often encounterd where one owner has inadvertently built a building, fence, or driveway over ajoining land. This agreement may contain provisions that call for the removal of the offending improvement upon the happening of a future event,e.g. destruction by fire or wind, or by a specific time. The market value of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that a risk exists and/or that the offending improvement might have to be removed at a certian time or in the event of partial or full destruction by fire or other cause.

The buyers lawyer undertakes a title search at the land registry office in which the property is situated. An existing survey, if available is normally requested, before the title search. If in land titles the search involves all current information concerning the property as shown on the parcel register. In registry the search is for a period of at least 40 years, and involves an examination of the chain of title describing all transactions as well as any gaps, errors or missed parties. In both instances the lawyer is looking for items such as outstanding encumbrances, restrictive covenents, and matrimonial home status. The lawyer will also investigate ajoining lands to ensure compliance with the Planning Act. The date of the search is recorded in anticipation of a sub-search at point of closing. Then the lawyer will search various non-title records including but not limited to, zoning(to ensure that the present use conforms to zoning by-laws.
