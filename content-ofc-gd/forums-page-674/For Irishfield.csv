472610,blaque,2010-06-04 20:54:00,2419," Thats the beauty, all those wings pack up and get trailed behind the car when its on pavement lol. Nice and narrow like.  Too bad it never got off the ground.......a harr a hardy harr uh hummmm sorry"
472821,irishfield,2010-06-05 23:08:00,26272,"Thanks Blaque.. It did get off the ground and there is still a flying example.. maybe a couple more. Issue was it was pretty much useless, as have been any other renditions to date."
472841,Billy Bob,2010-06-06 00:23:00,5865,"Irish,  I know you're interested in aircraft so I thought you might be interested in the Wright Paterson Air Force Museum in Ohio......spent 3 hours there last year and didn't see half of it so we are going back later this month.  This museum has EVERYTHING that has flown under the USA colors including the intercontinental ballistic missiles standing upright INSIDE the museum. The place is HUGE.  This year I want to see the I-MAX show they have there...they do charge for that but the rest of the museum is FREE (my favorite 4 letter word)...  http://www.nationalmuseum.that other site.mil/  The Doolittle Raiders Goblets are also on display there.   Bob"
