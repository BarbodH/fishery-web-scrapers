Most of the bays are shallow because the water is about five feet lower than usual at this time of the year. So I fished the deeper water adjacent to the bays but no fish. I have been hunting new water and have been casting and trolling, spinnerbaits crankbaits. spoons etc and have managed only one nice fish and that was on thursday, she was close to 40 inches and very healthy. Caught her in 4 fow in rocks and scattered weeds. Picked up some new baits on the weekend and am going to try it again during the week. Anyone else having the same problems on the Ottawa or is it just me? Think maybe i will get my maps out and try a find a few new spots to try. Saddles and sunken islands maybe, who knows?"
