15915,Mike the Pike,2006-12-25 00:59:00,3421,Well I gave it one more go from shore today with my friend Mike.We tried for some steel heads and browns it just was not our day today.Another beautiful day not too cold.We tried worms lures spoons the whole works but the fishies were hanging out with St.Nick.   The outting started last night with 25 minutes to catch some(8) dew worms.Lets just say Rich from Dover inspired me to get out there.Could not buy worms anywhere.   The drive too the fishing hole.     Montreal from Far away.  The hot spot that was not.Not Today .Next were movin on.  My friend Mike who invited me to fish this area .    Yes I am tryin but I am not cryin.  I am still wishing.Break time.Next spot.      Another hotspot that let us down.Next.      Another spot but no trout.Gotta keep movin.  I just got stopped by a couple taking a walk and they asked if they could take my picture.i asked them to take one with mine.Next fishing spot coming up.      the day is coming to an end.  Thats it I have to call it a day after all it is Christmas Eve. Mike and I did not catch anything but we did have a great day. With weather like this I will be back at it soon.  To all you Great OFC people.Merry Christmas.  Mike the Pike............(Skunked)

16130,Mike the Pike,2006-12-26 02:23:00,3421,Dave I am impressed that after all those years you managed to retain some french.And you wrote it very well.As for me I can speak it well but to write french thats pretty hard.If you come back to Quebec speaking french like that the woman will be after you Dave.  Merry Christmas to you and your family. Thanks for a great year of walleye reports.Mike
