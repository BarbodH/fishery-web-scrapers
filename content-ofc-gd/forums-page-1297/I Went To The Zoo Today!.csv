16310,PatB,2006-12-27 03:26:00,104,Cooper has some beautiful blue eyes. Are those another set of eye's behind the ice????
16314,pigeonfisher,2006-12-27 03:59:00,696,"that is not ice, but a fast thin waterfall!!!  those eyes you see may be the polar bears that passed away at Metro Zoo and are haunting the grounds.  Believe it or not, they died of the west nile!"
