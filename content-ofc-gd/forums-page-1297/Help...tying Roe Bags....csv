We have floats, hooks, bags, roe, leaders etc....   The only problem is that we dont really know how to tie the bags....how much roe per bag etc.   We're hoping to hook into some of the awesome looking steelheads posted on here by other members.  Any help would be appreciated....websites, personal experiences.  Thanks in advance...hopefully we'll having something for a fishing report on Friday...."
16474,charlied,2006-12-27 20:57:00,584,"my suggestion would be if it is salmon roe....3 eggs...if its trout roe then 5-7 eggs.  Its easy to tie them put them on the spawn square, fold it up and use the spiderwire (think thats what its called) tyeing line you can get at crappy tire, then just wrap it around 9 or ten times and pull it till you hear a snap and cut the excess off, leave a little colour thou."
16476,FishFinder,2006-12-27 21:19:00,481,"To be honest it really depends on conditions, if the visibility is around 1 foot or below tie big loonie or toonie sized bags if not make thiem nickle sized if its any clearer. THere is no set amount so make the bags according to water conditions.. Also as for colours for low visiblity tie chartuse and pink and for clearer water stick with white, peach and the odd blue for really clear water. Heres an example of what i tie for 1.5 ft or so ft visibility... "

That thread charlied mentioned makes tying a lot easier.  Mike"

Size, colour doesn't matter as much as the quality of the roe.  Make shur you're using the lightest leaders and the smallest hooks you can get away with to increase ur success.  All the best."
