16306,pigeonfisher,2006-12-27 03:11:00,696,Just go for wings...
16332,hawkeye,2006-12-27 11:30:00,162,dito to what Pigeonfisher said. I looked at the long range forecast for Keswick and can you believe Jan 10 +12  They might be off a degree or two but any self respecting ice that forms will be short lived
16359,Dano,2006-12-27 14:26:00,719,"Hey Mike, we could always have a water skiing get together!"
16365,Tdel,2006-12-27 14:34:00,393,"   Am I looking in the wrong place? Are you sure you are talking about Keswick Ontario?   Keswick, New Brunswick has temps almost that high in the 14 day trend but not Keswick Ontario.   Maybe there is a fuddle duddle somewhere.  Tom."
16370,DanTheMan,2006-12-27 14:48:00,257,Lots of ice in Timmins
16374,tjsa,2006-12-27 15:02:00,1578," Don't tease them Dan,"
16377,Greencoachdog,2006-12-27 15:11:00,8163, Why not???... you did Tom!
16379,danc,2006-12-27 15:17:00,4677,Don't forget the mosquito repellent...
16554,daisy_girl58,2006-12-28 05:22:00,116,"I should give you guys our phone number because when you start skiing on Simcoe  out here by Keswick. I want to be able to see this spectacle, cause nobody would ever believe it! Including my hubby and I!  Lorissa"
16580,hawkeye,2006-12-28 13:24:00,162,Yes TomD that was Keswick ON. Thought I could show you the graph but they changed it and are now looking at around +1  take a look here http://www.weather.ca/weather/14day/pages/CAON0342.htm
16596,oldphart,2006-12-28 14:24:00,665,"~~~~I'll be on Simcoe on the 1st.   for Whitephish and Trout from my boat, along with 2 other boat loads of Buds.   Temp looken to be about +6, with light showers"
16604,Tdel,2006-12-28 14:45:00,393,"Thank you Hawkeye, I appreciate the feedback.  I didn't realize that the temperature on the 14 day weather trend could change so much in just a couple of hours.  Wow!!  The trend doesn't seem to be favoring ice making for awhile, whether it is +10 or +1  Tom."
16623,Joey,2006-12-28 16:10:00,9122,"I wonder how easily my new two man ice clam would be to pull behind the boat    If we go fast enough, two people could waterski on it!!  Maybe we'll just all have to head up to Tom's or Dan's to stay  Joey"
16786,Rizzo,2006-12-29 01:01:00,4754,"I would put absolutely zero faith in a 14 day forecast.  Heck, they can't even get tomorrow right half the time."
16875,carll2,2006-12-29 04:51:00,443,decent ice 1 hr north of montreal..i have no problems
16894,Fisherman,2006-12-29 06:54:00,7201,"It appears that Callander Bay at N Bay may make enough ice in the next 2 weeks, apparantely 2-3 inches already, it might work to walk out."
