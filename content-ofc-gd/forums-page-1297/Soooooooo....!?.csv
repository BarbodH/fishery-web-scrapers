They're kits 1/350 scale One will be the USS Penn, sister of the Arizona and the one I just got is the British King George V. I don't know if I will go into all the detail that some do when building these. Some of this is awesome detailed work. I figure 6-9 months to build the first. I'll do some photos along the way and although it's NF I will share them even if I screw up"

16892,kennyman,2006-12-29 06:39:00,737,"First of all,let me say, my family ends up with three seperate Christmas celebrations (one for each side of the family). Now I got some fishing stuff last night from my mom and stepfather. A Storm ice fishing rod with Fireline Micro ice line(anyone use this stuff?)and  a ""slush scooper"". I've never been ice fishing,so I'll have to give it a whirl. On Christmas day my wife got me a $50 BPS gift card and a book on NP and musky. Now my dad and my stepmom were down from the Smith Falls area a couple weeks ago and they are so thrilled that I'm hooked on fishing now they got me an ultralite combo so I can hit the Orillia Perch festival with them in a few months better prepared. They've been fishing that festival start to finish for years and years. They get there two days before and leave two days after. That's almost a month of every year fishing for perch.He even got the big tag a few years back. Was worth about $21,000 bucks or something around there. Oh, I opened up another box as well with I think close to twenty lures in it. A couple of the big wooden ones he had made, a few tried and true oldies he pulled from his own tackle box and a few brand new lures and some braided line too. He was grinning from ear to ear and so was I. It was a great Christmas as far as the fishing goodies went,but even better was spending time with family and friends and sharing a few glasses of Christmas cheer. The absolute best part for me as always was watching my kids. That/s what it's all about. Hope you all had a great one too."
16926,Chris,2006-12-29 13:16:00,405,"Wow, some nice loot there everyone. Our family typically does not spend a lot at X-mas, but this year we broke down and went nuts. My wife got a fancy Danome sewing machine for doing her quilting and I got this 16 channel Yamaha audio workstation, and a couple of mics. I can now do CD and broadcast quality recordings. Just have to learn how to use it now.....  "
16133,bucktail,2006-12-26 02:34:00,1857,"Got a beauty St Croix fast action baitcaster from my lovely wife. The exact one I need to work my power pro better. I also got this the day before christmas!    But it all went downhill when a glass broke last night and I got this.    5 hours in the emerge.Got to bed at 7 am , It doesnt look too bad now. I really am losing the christmas  spirit, last week I had to take people to a private lunch that basically blackmailed me to go...... I ended up with food poisonng. No good deed goes un-punished! I guess I am being tested."
