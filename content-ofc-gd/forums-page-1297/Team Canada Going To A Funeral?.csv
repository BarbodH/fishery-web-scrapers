Those kids are dressed in Black, since when is this a team Canada color. Even their white uniforms have so little red it's disgusting.  I was sure our country's colors were still red and white.  That's my rant for today."
16197,snoil,2006-12-26 19:08:00,139,They are terrible aren't they?Watching on a 19 inch makes them look even worse.
16201,verno,2006-12-26 19:25:00,178,They had those black ones for a couple years havent they?
16209,joonmoon,2006-12-26 20:19:00,528,"They have had them for several yrs now. The Russians are red, the Checz are red and blue so I think they look very cool wearing the black and red with the nifty red and white racing stripe down the sleeves. Who cares anyway as long as they play well and win. What goaltending a good start to the tourney. GO CANADA GO."
16229,Lostchild,2006-12-26 22:00:00,153,Yeah and they have never lost a game when wearing the black uniforms.  GO CANADA GO!
16281,Smokey,2006-12-27 02:15:00,1278,I'm a tradationalist I like the old uniforms. I can't get used to the blacks.
16288,Mike the Pike,2006-12-27 02:22:00,3421,Yes there pretty ugly uniforms considering we invented the game of hockey you would think we would have stuck to our traditonal red uniforms.I wonder who decided this the world federation of hockey.Whats next black sweaters for the Olympics. Go Canada Win!
16297,98Fahrenheit,2006-12-27 02:52:00,108,The LA Kings had Black Uniforms.  As did the Chicago Blackhawks.  So did the Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh Pengiuns.  Anything wrong?  Nah.
16458,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-27 20:01:00,2585,"i personally like the black look!  I know its not traditional colours but remeber the jersey sales of a new style(colour) does help Hockey Canada.  Whatever colour they were, GO CANADA GO!  CHeers!"

You could see the numbers if close enough but that's it. Black tops, black shorts and black sox. By far the uglyest uniforms ever.  Only ugly uniforms I ever saw in the NHL were the Flyers long pants."
16501,Smokey,2006-12-27 22:27:00,1278,Funny I played hockey just yesterday against a guy still wearing the old cooper-alls.
