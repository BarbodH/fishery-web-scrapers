16221,Greencoachdog,2006-12-26 21:00:00,8163,It's a google ad and has nothing to do with this site... you need to click on it as many times as possible because when you do the people that have that site have to pay for every click.
16223,bigfish1965,2006-12-26 21:22:00,3382,"Google places ads on sites like ours depending on the content and which keywords the advertiser pays for. Since the knobs at P3TA decided to pay for 'fishing' their ad appears on fishing sites or sites that mention fishing. As a term of service, admins are not allowed to say you should click on a Google ad link. But if I wasn't an admin........"
16226,Corey,2006-12-26 21:29:00,355,"Whoever owns the adsense account for the ads shown on here can explicitly deny ads from certain advertisers or domain from running on here as well.  So to avoid bogus clicks from people on here, which can eventually lead to an account suspension for OFC, someone would be better off adding fishinghurts to the list of ads which should not be shown on here.  This conversation recently happened on another smaller fishing messageboard.  cd."
