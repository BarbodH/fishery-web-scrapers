16448,fishbait,2006-12-27 19:32:00,23,We have driven along the great lakes and thought we could get some pull of the road type of fishing in on the way.  How is 11 from Cochrane to Nipigon?  Any web sites for camps/motels along the way would be appreciated
16451,irishfield,2006-12-27 19:41:00,26272, Straight and boring! Don't forget to stop in Moonbeam to take your picture under the UFO!
16478,fishbait,2006-12-27 21:21:00,23,any little bodies of water to put a small boat or canoe in to fish?
16485,irishfield,2006-12-27 21:39:00,26272,Could camp at Rene ?? Provincial Park for a night or two and fish. I misplaced my parks book..can't remember the name of the park. Probably a motel in Moonbeam as well...not sure what's there to fish in the immediate area. Have never stopped to do so between Hearst and Rene ? Park. Could stop in Hearst...many lakes there and I'm sure Medic can help you there and get you out on a water body.
16525,fishbait,2006-12-28 02:16:00,23,"i am just tired of driving just to get someplace and passing up water.  The drive fron buffalo to Cochrane is just filled with little lakes right next to the road.  I was hopping hat the ride on 11 thru Hearst and down to TB would be the same.  How long of a flight in a 172 would it be from where you are to Thunderbay, with fuel stops?"
16526,irishfield,2006-12-28 02:33:00,26272,"In the spring....could be weeks thanks to mist/fog. Like they say..""time to spare...go by air"" ! Not an option I would be chosing if I had a schedule of any kind to stick to. I don't even take my airplane up to Temagami until late June/early July and even then cross country can be iffy in the highest terrain in Ontario.  Like you say LOTS of water all the way up #11 to Cochrane. Not as much along the road from there to Hearst, but should be lots of opportunity around Kapaskasing. After Hearst lots of water again right to Nipigon/Thunder Bay.  BTW..the Provincial Park (has a lake) between Cochrane and Kapaskasing is called Rene Brunelle."

16582,fishbait,2006-12-28 13:36:00,23,"We took 17 last time, we are not much on trout but you are right it scenic.  thanks for the input, we are scheduled for a tuesday to tuesday week so we might leave on Sat or Sun and do some fishing along the way.  PJ"
