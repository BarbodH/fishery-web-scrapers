15595,fishergirl72,2006-12-24 01:26:00,455,"You are NOT alone, I do the same thing for myself, especially with handbags. Men have no clue on what handbag or piece  of jewllery are the ""IT"" thing at the time"
15597,Greencoachdog,2006-12-24 01:36:00,8163,"  If we knew that.... we wouldn't really be men, now would we?"
15608,Canuck2fan,2006-12-24 02:30:00,1444,"I get a gift for myself every year, only way I will ever get what I want... This year I got myself a Swan Noodle Rod Company black 11.5 ft superlight action rod, and got with a Pflueger Medalist C6040 spinning reel for it..... For my birthday I will get an Okuma Aventa or Sheffield to go on it."
15691,Rattletrap2,2006-12-24 06:36:00,1652,"I can honestly say that I've never had to do that. My Wife and Daughters put up with and support my passion for ""all things to do with fish""! We decorate the tree with lures and fishing related items, we decorate most of the house with fishing related stuff, and they always get me stuff I really like and want, to do with fishing.  Of course it works both ways too. We communicate a great deal on what it is we like and need. Works very well for us!  Most of the year, we put off buying everyday things on a weekly basis.....then go absolutely nuts at this time of year. The girls are growing up now ( 15, 20 , and 23).....but on this day, we are like a bunch of 5 year olds! LOL  Great fun! Tomorrow will be no different!"
16117,fishergirl72,2006-12-26 00:52:00,455,You got a good point there Greencoachdog!

16250,nautifish,2006-12-27 00:11:00,1416,  LOL FISHERGRL.....  Actually i hate handbags allways have there a damn pain if u ask me..  ..lol....As for gifts my boy's are usually pretty good but if i happen to see something i like fishing related i just buy it anyway. No from me to me....
16252,Rizzo,2006-12-27 00:32:00,4754,"almost all my gifts are from myself, wife gets her own too.  Just the odd surprise from me to her and vice versa.  This way we get what we want, plus a little surprise thrown in"
16265,fishergirl72,2006-12-27 01:40:00,455,"LOL @ Nautifish, I will agree that they are a pain, but I need to carry one with all the stuff that I have.  so if I have to carry one, I would like for it to be nice  I will say though, fishindevil is great at knowing my taste in clothing, perfume etc. Our daughter and him got me a gift card from sirens and a Louis Vittion handbag   so I guess that I was a good girl this year.LOL   I am looking forward to meeting you at the swill, see you soon!"
16311,camillj,2006-12-27 03:26:00,1988,Got myself a new pair of hockey gloves this year .... it was an impulse buy (they were right in the next aisle from the fishing gear at CT  ... needed a few stocking stuffers  My ladies always do me proud ... got a Helly Hanson Survival suit ... which this year might be very useful if it ever does freeze up ... since it will keep me afloat  .... and ... I got the 60 second erection ... er ... set-up ... portable ice hut ... what more could a guy ask for !
16347,Fang,2006-12-27 13:53:00,1330,"Well I got surprised this year. I ordered 2 reels from BPS for myself and thinking I had done this in enough time to have them under the tree, was a little disappointed when nothing showed up at the door before xmas.  To my suprise I opened a gift from the wife and kids and found 2 BPS Extreme baitcasters. I didn't know whether it was the reels I ordered or if my wife found the subtle hints in the BPS catalogue. She finally told me that she was home when they got delivered and thought it would be funny to wrap them up."
15317,Fang,2006-12-23 02:31:00,1330,"For years my wife has refused to buy any Xmas gifts related to fishing or hunting. I'm usually quite open giving her the UPC code, aisle location, even offering to map the item location in the store on my GPS unit  So every year I'm forced to put a couple of ""To Me - From Me!!"" items under the tree. I even look suprised when I open them in front of everyone.  So who else out there does this. Am I alone???  This years To Me - From Me  BPS Extreme EXT10 Left Hand 3 Yozuri deep cranks for next years trip to BOQ  anything i might find at Fishing world on saturday."
15318,danc,2006-12-23 02:39:00,4677, Yup. You're alone. Merry Christmas.
15320,Mike the Pike,2006-12-23 02:49:00,3421,"Yup your alone,My wife wants nothing to do with fishing she loves to eat  the fish but it does not go any farther.She has bought me many fishing items on my list.Yup she spoils me.Time to have a serious talk with your wife or you should stop buying what she likes .Plan C would be to show her this thread when its done.Good Luck Mike"
15324,ccmtcanada,2006-12-23 03:12:00,7971,"You are NOT alone now....haha.  Every year, I actually will BUY and WRAP a few presents for myself from either my wife or kids.  I always have to look surprised."
15326,Kerry,2006-12-23 03:15:00,383,"Me too fang but I don't bother wrapping I just say I can't use it until after Christmas and get to stare at it for a couple of weeks.Tonight's gift was the Cobra's on sale at CTC,they let me have em tonight instead of waiting in a line tomorrow. Kerry"
15332,fishdawg,2006-12-23 03:33:00,912,"ya  I do it every year  - some peole should just NOT be allowed to go tackle shopping for someone else this year bought both of ""my"" gifts in Nov & have used them early  8'6 St Croix Wild River spinning rod - already got some trout on it  Garmin Extex Lengend Cx - has a coupla waypoints on it already"
15333,Rich,2006-12-23 03:34:00,3927,I dunno but I am buying myself some Xmas presents after I get my huge new years bonus
15348,mepps,2006-12-23 06:01:00,1301,"I'm with you buddy, I just got myself a present the other day.  To Clive   Love Clive"
15358,lew,2006-12-23 11:49:00,12767,"Not fishing related, but I did buy myself a Christmas present the other day.  I was wandering around the store looking for a present for Diane when I spotted a set of pliers/cutters marked down from $40 to $10 and what self respecting man could pass up a deal like that ??  I came home and stuck them under the tree and just promised not to use them till after the BIG day"
15360,Rich Clemens,2006-12-23 12:14:00,3131,"I help Santa out by telling her what I want .... then go ahead and buy it.   The only stipulation is, it must stay in the box until Christmas Day.   So, come Christmas, I can open my Lowrance H2O, watch the instructional DVD, and load MapCreate 6 Canada Topo on the computer.  I'll have plenty of toys to play with this Christmas.  Unfortunately, the couple lures I got, will have to wait a while longer."
15361,Greencoachdog,2006-12-23 12:19:00,8163,"I usually buy myself something for Christmas, but not because my wife doesn't buy me what I like. She knows the meaning and value of the ""GIFT CARD""... usually Cabelas or BassPro, it's always the right size and color!!!"
15387,b2kptbo,2006-12-23 13:54:00,1505,... 
15389,OhioFisherman,2006-12-23 13:58:00,6623,"LOL Fang! ME, I am the easiest guy in the world to shop for a BPS or Cabela`s gift certificate and I am good. LOL don`t even think about buying me fishing tackle! LOL My mother in law bought me a chair with a rod holder like the first or second year we were married, ???????? what`s this thing? a fishing chair! LOL I got them in the boat! what am I going to do with this? A 150 dollar watch one year, LOL it`s still in a drawer. LOL I know what I need dear you don`t, forget the gifts. Ya I also got a tie, Cleveland Browns, it`s in the trash! Go Steelers! Better yet who`s in first place! My Team! LOL"
15397,SlowPoke,2006-12-23 14:11:00,2984,"My wife and I have been doing that for a couple of years now... we buy a couple things for ourselves and put eacothers name on the gifts. It works great! We also get eachother some surprises. This year I'm getting a Garmin GPSMap 76 that I purchased a few months ago on sale 50% off. My wife purchased some clothes and a purse for herself from me and her surprise gift will be a large LCD or small Plasma (32-42"") for the bedroom. That reminds me, I have some  TV shopping to do... later folks! -Brian"
15406,Handlebarz,2006-12-23 14:48:00,3790,"Well I must say that my wife comes through good alomost all of the time she has bought me a ice auger,portable ice hut (it had to go back but not her fault) lures that I will actually use not just some junk ones that will never see the water, and she gets the tools right I just let her know when getting tools buy craftsman or mastercraft this way they are lifetime warntee, received a tablesaw drill press router (I still have to use it) and much more she is great a picking the stuff out. But I do get somethings for my self I think I have alot of hair and blades and other componets for making lures this winter coming but then again I did not see a package arive from the post man so who knows."
15423,camillj,2006-12-23 15:36:00,1988,Been doing it for years .... may sound dumb .. but still feels good on christmas day  ... and especially if I KNOW that nobody would get it for me .. or if its something the whole family can benefit from ... like a new drift sock ... or a portable transducer mount ... or ... oh somebody stop me I am getting all excited !
15432,Carp,2006-12-23 16:06:00,1488,"I don't make a big deal about presents. When I need or want something fishing or hunting related, I just go get it myself. No wrapping necessary. I just got a new vehicle 3 weeks ago and a new (used) ice hut last weekend. Merry Christmas to me !!!  The presents are for the wee ones now. That's where we concentrate our present efforts."
15442,kemper,2006-12-23 16:29:00,2232,"From me...  To me.  2007 Intense Socom, the sweetest ride out there."
15451,dwc67,2006-12-23 17:36:00,140,"it will not be under the tree but i am getting the bradley smoker, it's in the bps boxing day flier to go on sale the 26th."
15461,danc,2006-12-23 18:25:00,4677,"You know, on second thought, this isn't a bad idea. So, I did go out and buy myself a present today. To me, from me. It's under the tree now. I just hope that I have the willpower to leave it there until Monday. Merry Christmas everyone.    By the way, this is an actual unphotoshopped Crown Royal label. You can go to their web site and join the ""Society of the Crown"" for free. From there you can order 5 free customized labels per month."
15463,setomonkey,2006-12-23 18:29:00,872,People have bought me fishing lures etc. but they don't always know what I want or need. If I want something bigger like a new rod & reel then I just go get it myself.  Mike
15473,Carp,2006-12-23 18:54:00,1488,  A great idea Dan. I may just have to add that to the many things I'd like to buy myself.
15480,Spiel,2006-12-23 19:05:00,9065,"....If it wasn't for gifts ""To me, from me"" I'd get nothing.  I'm a very bad boy."
15535,Whopper,2006-12-23 22:20:00,2174,"LOL Glen, I don't buy myself anything but I do have my daughters dailed into the gift cards, so no more coffe cups   . Now I gotta to get the wife and son onboard  Whopper"
15571,Chris Cross,2006-12-24 00:02:00,46,"The lady and I get our own gifts, wrap it up , and swap gifts. We each get a surprise. Last year I opened her foot massage. She opened my leather moccasins. Works for us. CX"
