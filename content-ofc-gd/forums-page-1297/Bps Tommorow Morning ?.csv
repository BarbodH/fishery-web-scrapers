16174,dwc67,2006-12-26 16:22:00,140,it was good seeing you guys again. when the ice shows up we will have to get out
16215,lookinforwalleye,2006-12-26 20:50:00,4399,"Well i just got back and let me tell you i won`t do that again,BPS was busy but it wasn`t too bad but the parking lot was a joke especially on the way out.  I was a little disappointed in the sale to be honest i was looking to pick up a couple of baitcasting combo`s on sale but nothing decent  to be found. I did pick up a Bionic blade spinning rod for 40 bucks off and a nice Quantum KVD for 30 bucks off. Also picked up some nice shirts at 15 bucks off."
16230,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-26 22:11:00,0," Dave, it was good to see you as well.  If you want some company, shoot me a PM when you're heading out"
