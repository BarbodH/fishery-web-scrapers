16268,Joey,2006-12-27 01:42:00,9122,"Thanks to Charlesn, here is the show link.  Nobody I know saw it as they couldn't sit through another 1/2 hour of silicone valley    It's about the fourth one down on the left.  Lime Green OFC shirt  My Webpage    Cheers.  Joey"
16269,fishergirl72,2006-12-27 01:46:00,455,"Fishindevil and I were waiting to see you on the show but for the same reason, we could not sit there any longer and watch a show that barely shows any fishing at all, IMO, it's not even a fishing show! I am looking forward at meeting you at the swill Joey! Talk to you soon, and congrats on the show, WAY TO GO GIRL"
16274,Terry,2006-12-27 01:59:00,14456,very cool
16277,Smokey,2006-12-27 02:06:00,1278,"Congrats Joey. I missed it yesterday, glad you got the link up.  Mike"
16279,steve_paul,2006-12-27 02:12:00,658,Nice job Joey.
16284,charlesn,2006-12-27 02:18:00,551,"No probs, merry belated Xmas!  Charlesn"
16292,Lostchild,2006-12-27 02:26:00,153,"Very nicely done, you're a natural. So did you get the lure back!?! LOL"
16322,bpsbassman,2006-12-27 04:46:00,941,Great job Joey!  You make us all proud!
16326,Mike the Pike,2006-12-27 06:19:00,3421,Good for you Joey.Can I have your autograph.
16330,ChrisK,2006-12-27 10:27:00,2772,"Your a natural Joey, What next,OFC days of our lives ??   Good job !!!!"
16339,lew,2006-12-27 13:02:00,12767,"WTG Joey, that's great stuff"
16341,Dave Mercer,2006-12-27 13:29:00,148,"Great Job Joey, Soon you will be taking my job! Thanks everyone for watching we have received a ton off emails to my site about The 12 Daves. I'm glad so many people liked it. But a few did not like the show that it was chosen to run during ( I didn't choose it ). So here is my question to you guys what show would you like next years 12 Daves of Christmas to run during. Anyways take care and I hope Santa was good to you all!!!  Regards, Dave Mercer www.factsoffishing.com"
16345,steve_paul,2006-12-27 13:50:00,658, 24 hours of The Next Bite would not be too hard to take next Christmas.  Very nice job Dave on the 12 Daves too.
16382,fishergirl72,2006-12-27 15:24:00,455,"Hi Dave. We hope you had a great Christmas   I have to agree with steve paul, 24 hours of the Next Bite would be a whole lot better, it would keep people watching instead of changing it within an hour."
16384,mistyjr1,2006-12-27 15:30:00,97,Very nice Joey. Hopefully you got that lure back
16389,nautifish,2006-12-27 15:46:00,1416,Way to go joey.  well done grl.
16396,dustink,2006-12-27 16:42:00,526,WTG Joey!  Great stuff....  dk
16402,fishindevil,2006-12-27 17:12:00,6254,"WOW,great job joey.you did really well,and i hope you get that lure back..lol..lol"
16435,irishfield,2006-12-27 18:28:00,26272,"Dave...next time running it amongst a normal day of fishing shows would work much better.... for a MUCH larger audience. 12 consecutive hours of ""1 real...2 bait"" works for nobody but the single guy getting through the day alone...and even he'd have to be pretty desperate.  Wish I wasn't on dial up so I could actually see Joey do her thing..."
16452,charlesn,2006-12-27 19:42:00,551,"I agree with Irish, no need to show any one show for 24 hours.  Someone is bound to be disinterested.  I'd no sooner watch 24 hours of the Next Bite for example than I would Hotlines.  The 16 hour FLW Tour marathon on New Year's Eve is awesome, but that's because I'm a tourney nut.  I'm sure to some it's a turn off.  A nice mix of ""Best of"" shows might be a way to win some more fans for the coming season for several shows.  Charles"
16669,TJQ,2006-12-28 19:58:00,7806,Wow... I finally got my hi-dspeed back... very cool video Joey!!  Looks like it was a lot of fun!!
16686,Spiel,2006-12-28 21:22:00,9065,"....Geeeez, I just had a chance to watch it as well. Guess you'll be signing autographs tomorrow....me first, me first!"
16757,Joey,2006-12-28 23:50:00,9122,"LOL, bring the waterproof marker.  Joey"
16788,JEREMY,2006-12-29 01:12:00,300,Maybe you can join Dave and Bob at the bass pro spring show.Good job guys loved it.
