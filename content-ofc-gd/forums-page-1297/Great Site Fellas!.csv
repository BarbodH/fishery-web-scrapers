It's a Pike/Bass tournament we hold every September out of Rockland Ontario on the Ottawa river. It's a one day / one fish per species tourney, biggest single fish weight,  with some great prizes. It's a fun tournament, that heas a field of everything from bass boats to 12 foot tinnies....We go to a guys house for burgers and dogs afterwards that's included in the entrance fee ($10.00 per species)...here's a link to read more about it...hope to see ya there! It's a great day with alot of laughs! RUMBLE in Rockland 06  regards, Mike  Thx for the welcome nautifish! much appreciated!"
