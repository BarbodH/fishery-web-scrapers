15334,wishn4fishn,2006-12-23 03:36:00,108,"Caught this guy on 3 seperate occasions.   Every time it looked more and more bruised. Broken Jaw Pike  Pretty scrapy for a lil dude   This brookie was ""unique"" not ugly in a way that there was a lonely red dot caught on micro brook roe "
16936,Chris,2006-12-29 13:26:00,405,"Hi, caught this grotesque looking beast while fishing on the Ottawa River.  "
14349,Mike the Pike,2006-12-20 02:25:00,3421,"Ok ladies and Gentleman have any of you got some good shots of Ugly fish?Battle scar fish ,Tumors,2 heads ,one eye etc......CCMT no cheating no photoshop for you.  Mike"
14361,BabyHerc,2006-12-20 02:59:00,285,"No pic, but I caught a pike on Simcoe that had a permanent S-bend in it's body.  Looked like it had been hit by a boat.  It was starved, too.  Had the length of a 5 or 6 lber, but wieghed less than 2."
14416,Pinch,2006-12-20 06:47:00,231,I caught this guy in Bon Echo Prov Park in the summer.  I think i posted it on the old site to find out what the marks were.  Main consensus was it was hit by a prop.   I caught this guy in Bon Echo Prov Park in the summer.  I think i posted it on the old site to find out what the marks were.

14427,Photoz,2006-12-20 09:52:00,792,"Last year during the sucker run on Lake Simcoe, a few of us got together a couple days and fished Beaverton (Beaver River, near the mouth) using light rod, light line & worms, hung about 4' under a float . . . .   for a great day of fishin,' these guys are a ton o' fun on the light gear .  .  . VERY scrappy! These suckers are B I I I  I   G . . . .      Beansie got the biggest at 4.9 pounds! The one with the ugly growth on the side of its head (cancer?) seemed healthy enough . . .      and put up a good fight . . .      it was released (what else would ya do with it?) and swam away quickly.    But . . . . .    just think if you had hemorrhoids like this guy has . . . . .      you'd need to buy your Preparation 'H' by the pail! He was caught up where the Trent hits Simcoe, near the swing bridge. Again, other than the obvious problem, the fish seemed normal . . . . .      other than a few catfish (bullheads) & an occasional pike, I've never seen any other fish with similar looking tumors? Will they eventually kill the fish?  "

14452,Pinch,2006-12-20 12:44:00,231,"  Probably the best tasting fish in the lake, and you just let it go for no reason what so ever, I mean come on, whats a little external growth between friends!!!!"
14453,Crazyhook,2006-12-20 12:56:00,1154,"photoz... as we have previously learned, there is nothing wrong with taking a fish home for the table  thought i had my first mirror carp when i saw the side but no.... maybe a prop did it  "
14460,Jer,2006-12-20 13:13:00,1426,Broke back perch...    ...caught off my dock a few years ago.
