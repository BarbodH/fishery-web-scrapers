Got to the first trib and the water was very high and fast moving so without wetting a line we drove down to Caledonia water was high but not as murky. Not to many fishermen down thier ethier, I thoguht it was going to be packed.   Shot of the river   Here is my first ever steel. Only a little shaker   Here's a shot of a few guys fishing across the river   Then later I got another shaker but this one was a bit bigger then the last one. "
