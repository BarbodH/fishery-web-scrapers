16032,bigfish1965,2006-12-25 15:08:00,3382,"My wife got me a GPS for Christmas. She wanted one I could use both in the car and in the boat. The sales weasel at The Source sold her on the Garmin Street Pilot c530...he told her I could simply download some software and use it in the boat. It is a very nice unit for a car, but is in no way shape or form a unit suitable for a boat. It says right in the manual 'Do not expose to moisture' and doesn't support any of the functions you would need in a boat.  So , unfortunately, I  have to return this one and get another. My question to y'all is what GPS offers both excellent marine and auto applications in a colour read-out?"
16036,Greencoachdog,2006-12-25 15:21:00,8163,Check this one out Rick... I was looking at it this morning for when my lumps of coal turn into diamonds.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...requestid=15717
16038,Fisherman,2006-12-25 15:28:00,7201,"Somehow Lowrance is the one that has never let me down, maybe take a look at this.  http://www.lowrance.com/Automotive/Products/iWAY600C.asp"
16040,fishindevil,2006-12-25 15:32:00,6254,"yes rick i was going to say the lowrance iway,there are several hand held units go to the lowrance website and check them out,the iway seems to be the best for the dollar with all the options that we,as fisherman will use  good luck    shawn"
16041,Terry,2006-12-25 15:37:00,14456,i like garmin but to each their own.... check out radioworld for pices and info on the ones you may want  radioworld
16052,Fisherman,2006-12-25 16:03:00,7201,"Ya, check radio worlds prices and then check some others.  Somehow, I've had some bad vibs from that place lately, either can't get it, they won't sell it to you, or ""oh we don't deal with that company"". Saturday was the last straw for me, ask for a simple transistor to repair a radio, they have them but won't sell it to me, Ah so I'm supposed to pay them for the repair I can do myself. Not likely. I've had much better service from Durham radio in Whitby."
16114,jjcanoe,2006-12-26 00:06:00,744,Make sure when they ask for the reason you are returning it you tell them THE SALESMAN LIED TO US ABOUT THE PRODUCT make sure they write that down on the return slip  jjcanoe
16141,Blake,2006-12-26 04:30:00,418,Ouch one salesman is going to get it.
16160,Reelsmokin,2006-12-26 14:08:00,5,have a look at  the gpsnuts.com site.  i found it useful when i was looking for a portable unit a few years back.  here's a link to a similar lowrance model with a full review http://www.gpsnuts.com/Lowrance/iFinder.htm Hope it helps.  Rrreelsmokin
16161,Greencoachdog,2006-12-26 14:12:00,8163,"Dunno if you shop online Rick, but I found an even better price on the iFINDER H2O.  http://www.emarinesupplies.com/index.asp?P...&ProdID=382"
16164,aplumma,2006-12-26 14:50:00,6896,Rick I have found the best unit for the road is the TOM TOM it is very easy and accurate. I use it daily and it has found 98 percent of the streets. On the water I use a Garmin chartplotter it is a seperate unit. You will find that none of the auto units do the job of GPS and Depthfinder as well as a marine unit. You will spend alittle more but the marine unit is built to take the abuse of jarring and wet locations like a auto unit cant.  Art
16166,Rattletrap2,2006-12-26 15:21:00,1652,"Rick, I have the handheld Garmin Vista C and it works very well both in the car, and in the boat. To be honest, for the lake I fish, I've got more use out oif it in the car when travelling! LOL"
16239,fishdawg,2006-12-26 22:57:00,912,"since you fish up in the French/Nipp area Rick, if you want charts for those areas make sure they are available for whatever brand you decide on  I recently picked up a Garmin Extex Legend Cx - very nice versatile unit, but its screen size may not be to your liking for car use"
