16123,spoonman,2006-12-26 01:17:00,103,"Merry Christmas everyone. I am going to be buying a GPS Unit with the navionic chip in it this new year. I was wondering if you guys could tell me which one you like the best. I already have the eagle 500c sonar unit so I am just looking for the GPS Unit, with detailed maping.  Any info would be great. Cheers AL"
16140,Blake,2006-12-26 04:28:00,418,"Without a doubt go with the Lowrance H20 in monochrome or if you have the $$ go the colour unit.  They are very precise and run the Navionics chip as well.  We use their units on the boat for tourneys and they are easy to use, waterproof, come with the cigarette adapter and as I said excellent for bringing you back right to your spot. Lowrance customer service is great and also right in Mississauga. Fishing World in Hamilton had some at the store last week as well as the Navionics chip."
16148,Raf,2006-12-26 06:46:00,3495,Dont go lowrance/navionics if you fish nippissing.  Navionics has big fat zero coverage for the lake.  garmin offers the most canadian coverage.
16171,JPD,2006-12-26 15:53:00,296,"Actually there is a new chip out for Lowrance and Humminbird. It's called a Hot Spots premiere I believe.  Here's the complete list, plus a ton in Quebec with more to come!!  Baptiste And Elephant		ON Bay of Quinte *		ON Big Gull		ON Black		ON Bobâ€™s		ON Boshkung And Twelve Mile		ON Chandos		ON Charleston		ON Christie		ON Crow		ON Devil		ON Eagle		ON Eagle *		ON Gull		ON Haliburton		ON Healey		ON Jack		ON Kahshe		ON Kashagawigamog		ON Kawagama		ON Kennisis		ON Lac Seul		ON Lake of the Woods *		ON Loughborough		ON Mary, Fairy, Vernon & Peninsula		ON Mazinaw		ON Mississipi		ON Opinicion		ON Otty		ON Paudash and Lower Paudash		ON Pikes		ON Rainy *		ON Redstone		ON Six Mile Wallmap		ON Temagami		ON Three Mile		ON White		ON Wolfe  JP"
16175,JorgeCarlos,2006-12-26 16:23:00,109,Raf which unit in Garmin u think is a good one with the charts for canadian waters??
16183,irishfield,2006-12-26 17:29:00,26272,When I put my deal together part of it was the Navionics Premium Hotmap for Canada. Supposed to have Lake Temagami in amongst that long list above. We were told it was not available yet when they tried to order...supposably January 07 it would be out.
16199,greyhawk,2006-12-26 19:11:00,33,I would go with the Lowrance - heard there have been problems servicing Garmins if so needed. Unit must be sent to Calif. resulting in delays and costs.
16240,fishdawg,2006-12-26 22:59:00,912,i like my Garmin - what Raf said
16242,fishindevil,2006-12-26 23:20:00,6254,"i was told not to buy the navionics gold ,because there is a platinum chip comming out soon,and it will offer even more they sais alot more than the gold chip does now,you can ask them at lowrance i sent them an -e-mail back in october when i bought my new graph and they told me to wait and not buy the gold chip for my unit,so im waiting till that comes out.and the coverage will be increased so i hope it will be out before i start salmon fishing in late march early april"
16262,JPD,2006-12-27 01:16:00,296,The Platinum chips have been out all year now. I have been running one since May of 2006. They have everything from the Larry to the 5 Great Lakes plus the Ottawa River and the Trent Severn. Not a bad deal at all. It would cost 3 times the amount to have all of the charts. Plus they work on color units and can zoom in closer than the Gold Series can.  JP
16272,Dondorfish,2006-12-27 01:53:00,1000,Where could I purchase a Platinum chip and do you have an approximate price?    Don
16275,irishfield,2006-12-27 02:03:00,26272,Good question Don...even their site shows it listed and yet not available for any Lowrance units. Site also shows the Canada Lakes Hot Maps and we were told when ordering my LCX110C and boat that it wasn't available until Jan sometime.
16285,Dondorfish,2006-12-27 02:18:00,1000,Hey Wayne - I was told basically the same thing - but when JPD said that he's had one all year - it kinda peaked my curiousity.   Don
16293,taper,2006-12-27 02:41:00,611,I have an Eagle Fishstrike 2000 and love it and you can't go wrong with Lowrance warranty and service work.
16295,Dondorfish,2006-12-27 02:49:00,1000,Taper   - I have the same unit - what chip are you running in it?   Don
16321,taper,2006-12-27 04:42:00,611,Tracker I am using a Navionics Eastern Great Lakes as well as a Ontario topographic which helps greatly when I go up to the French river.
16323,JPD,2006-12-27 05:00:00,296,I got my Platinum chip at Angling Outfitter's in Woodstock. They are one of the best around for Lowrance products.  519 539 5494 Ask for Jocylen.  The Platinum chip is dark blue with a silver sticker on it.  JP
16398,irishfield,2006-12-27 16:56:00,26272,For Don and myself JP...THANKS! Wayne
16529,Dondorfish,2006-12-28 03:27:00,1000,Thanks Taper and thank you Wayne. Looks like a trip to woodstock might be in my plans early in the new year - will post results.   Don
16600,JPD,2006-12-28 14:35:00,296,"I just got off the phone with Jocelyn regarding the platinum chip. It was my mistake.. I have the Gold Plus which is the most recent version and he sells it for $249. The Platinum chip, like Irishfield said is not made yet and will have Topography lines and satellite imagery but with run with a very hefty $$$ tag.  Sorry for the confusion. It's winter and I miss it all already"
16723,Dondorfish,2006-12-28 22:47:00,1000,Thanks JPD for clearing that up - saved me a drive to woodstock. Did they say when the platinum card would be out and how much it will be?   Thanks again Don
16725,Slayingm,2006-12-28 22:55:00,204,"Hey Spoonman,  I run the Navionics XL3 chip in my 'Lowrance H20 Expedition' handheld  and 334C Colour graph and tell you first hand that the chip works awesome in both units.  Good luck with your shopping!  Take care and good Fish'n.. Greg."
16766,JorgeCarlos,2006-12-29 00:15:00,109,today i saw the Lowrance H20C at BPS for $269 cdn.
