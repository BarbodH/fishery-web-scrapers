16441,charlied,2006-12-27 18:44:00,584,I just got a survival suit and I was thinking the same thing about cleaning....I would think if you just lay it on the floor and wipe it down with dish soap and water it should be fine....now the inside I have no clue.
16446,Mike Pike,2006-12-27 19:31:00,1332,"Hey CH312, does your suit have washing instructions printed somewhere inside, say around the neck area?  Sometimes cleaning instructions are right on it."

Always store your boating equipment and garments in a dry and well-ventilated area out of direct sunlight, and be sure to avoid stowage in areas that are prone to high humidity or significant temperature fluctuations.  You can try the following steps to help neutralize and limit the spread of mildew on the garment:  1. Soak in a solution of 2 cups of salt per gallon of warm water 2. Scrub affected mildew areas 3. Hang to dry in a well ventilated area 4. Once dry, hand wash with an antibacterial soap and warm water 5. Hang to dry completely and store in a dry place 6. Hang to dry in a well ventilated area 7. Once dry, hand wash with an antibacterial soap and warm water 8. Hang to dry completely and store in a dry place    How do I remove grease from Mustang Survival products?
