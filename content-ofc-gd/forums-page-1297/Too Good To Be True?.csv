16416,irishfield,2006-12-27 17:50:00,26272,Listing is no longer available...so something was wrong or it was a scam like 90% of the muscle cars on ebay.
16421,setomonkey,2006-12-27 18:01:00,872,"My experience is that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!  Mike"
16429,fishindevil,2006-12-27 18:18:00,6254,"yes i cant get to it either ,its now not avalible,it was prob,a scam....like the old saying goes if its to good to be true it prob is"
16443,moemoe,2006-12-27 18:58:00,352,"Question for Irishfield, How are most of the muscle cars on ebay scams? Just curious as I had looked into boats through ebay....."
16445,irishfield,2006-12-27 19:25:00,26272,"Guess I should have phrased that differently. Many are legitimate sales...just not done in the true ""spirit"" of ebay..so don't expect the item to be available by the time you want to bid closer to closing date. You will find that if you are bidding on a Muscle car on ebay that most of these guys will pull their auctions early..even days early... and sell directly. They use it as a sales flier instead of an auction. There are about 10% that are indeed scams...using stolen identities and pictures of someone elses car sold previously on ebay. Most are pretty easy to spot due to cut/paste mismatches and where they expect you to send money and/or how to send money."
16469,jsalz,2006-12-27 20:39:00,8,I should have known when the ad said not to ask questions through eBay but to email them directly. Funny that the seller had 2000 sales. Can they fake that too?
16472,irishfield,2006-12-27 20:50:00,26272," Watch for it to come back up...he may have made an error in the pricing and will post the auction again. Many want emails direct now as the questions come right up on the auction page for all to read.  When they steal an identity they steal everything name/sales count/feedback/ etc. Why you never respond to an enquiry from ""Ebay"" in your email addressed to simply your email address and not you personally. People that do so open themselves widely to having their account stolen."
