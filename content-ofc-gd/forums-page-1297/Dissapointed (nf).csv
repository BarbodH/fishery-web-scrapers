16273,fishergirl72,2006-12-27 01:58:00,455,"Well another Christmas come and gone and all of the gifts have been opened. This Christmas has been VERY good to me, but I was wondering if anyone got a gift that wasn't exactly their taste or something they didn't need or want? By the sounds of the other threads, it sounded like everyone got what they wanted or needed. But almost everyone gets that one gift that doesn't just sit right with us.  If so what was the gift and why were you dissapointed?"
16278,Smokey,2006-12-27 02:08:00,1278,No complaints this year for me. Everything was cool and something I could use. I was spoiled again as usual by my wife and family.
16280,fishergirl72,2006-12-27 02:14:00,455,That  is great to hear Smokey!  It sounds like you did really good
16283,Rizzo,2006-12-27 02:17:00,4754,"I thought I got a sweater and a shirt from the mother-in-law.  Turns out its just the collar of a shirt that sticks out the top of the sweater...sewn right in!  Not that the gift disappoints me, I just though it was kind of funny.  I wanted to wear a different shirt under the sweater, then found out it doens't quite work that way!"
16286,Whopper,2006-12-27 02:20:00,2174,"No complaints here! Didn't really need anything, but I received a pair of Ono's sunglasses with readers  . Something I wouldn't have gotten for myself.  Whopper"
16287,fishergirl72,2006-12-27 02:22:00,455,Yeah I do see your point Rizzo. You really don't see shirts/sweaters like that.  Well it sounds like you did good this year Whopper!  Glad to hear that your christmas went well for you.
16290,charlesn,2006-12-27 02:23:00,551,"Rizzo,  It's the thought that counts.  lol  Charles  P.S.  What does that mean anyways?  So if the person buys you something that is inappropriate or somewhat useless, how much thought went in to the selection?  What about re-gifting?  Then the thought is kinda evil.  I think I once re-gifted a re-gift back to the original re-gifter and they didn't notice.  lol"
16291,fishergirl72,2006-12-27 02:25:00,455,"LOL, you have a point to the ""regifting"""
16299,Daplumma,2006-12-27 02:57:00,1961,I wanted a screamer but I got a sweater instead!!!
16305,Joey,2006-12-27 03:11:00,9122,  Hahahahahaha!  Now that's funny!  Joey
16340,steve_paul,2006-12-27 13:17:00,658," Nice, very Cousin Eddy like  Mother in Law also surprised me with a sweater - very nice one if I was 5'2 instead of 6'2"".  Turns out she bought it in September and has lost the receipt - should be fun taking that one back.  Other than that, I got spoiled by everyone and loved everything, so pretty lucky here."
16363,nautifish,2006-12-27 14:31:00,1416,No complaints here   Allthough i will say this.....For the next whole yr i am going to be hinting i only want presents related to fishing.
