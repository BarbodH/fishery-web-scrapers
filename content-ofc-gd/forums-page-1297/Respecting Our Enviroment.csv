12418,nautifish,2006-12-15 04:36:00,1416,"  Since anglers are the most visible near the water we are the ones who usually are blamed for it.  I know it is not just fisherman Rick. But i filled a plastic carrier bag full of just fishing line today. There were tim horton cups every where,Plastic bottles, I even have on video a pile of ciggarette ends that had been dumped by the water. Unbeleviable, Broken plastic , Plastic bags. THE LIST GOES ON.    And thats very nice of you to offer free webspace & time, Thankyou so much.  Maybe what we need to do is try and get a volunteer leader for certain ereas and try and get so many people togeather  at different tribs?"
12422,wishn4fishn,2006-12-15 04:39:00,108,"yea yea, we need a leader.  Someone who is passionate and opinionated maybe a vegan, P3TA representitive or a feminist.  But seriously, good idea nauti."
12423,Mike the Pike,2006-12-15 04:43:00,3421,I vote for Nautifish.LOL
12424,nautifish,2006-12-15 04:44:00,1416,Okay i mean  a leader for each erea.
12426,snag,2006-12-15 04:48:00,1932,Garbage = ignorance.  Great thread!
12427,bigfish1965,2006-12-15 04:52:00,3382,An organization like that would require an overall leader. I second the nomination of nautifish.
12428,wishn4fishn,2006-12-15 04:53:00,108,"We should somehow get the homeless involved.  They'd have all the time in the world and we can donate some gear for garbage campaign.  I can see this blossoming now into something truly beauiful, like the world that we all should live in."
12436,Bernie,2006-12-15 05:17:00,3190,Hi Nautifish...You raised a very good issue....In the spring after the ice has gone from the lake you have no idea the mess that drifts into my bay...very sad indeed
12588,Bly,2006-12-15 18:27:00,1556,"Great thread!   I think the ideas being mentioned are wonderful and they would be awesome if we actually do something.  I also nominate Nauti for overall leader!  A simple thing really, but imagine if each and everyone of us took a garbage bag with us each time and did our best to fill it before leaving......  A little free advertisement and good PR if we were to all wear some OFC gear too!  blyght"
12631,Markus,2006-12-15 20:04:00,25,"Amo, the common ""clean up your garbage"" and ""respect the enviornment"" rants are always well recieved amongst the angling comunity.  I do think though that what you're seeing in your video isn't quite the same as littering.  I don't think an angler stood there and peeled 100 feet of line of and tossed it on the ground.  I think it's more likely the after effect of someone getting busted of by a fish or from a tangle on a long drift.  The dead line you're seeing eventually gets tangled in sticks and debris and washes up on the bank when creek levels flucuate.  Combine that with with a high pressure trib like the one you are walking and you'll unfortunately see it a lot.  It's good to pick it up like you did....it happens to us all.  Timmies cups and worm ontainers are what urk me the most."
12632,Entropy,2006-12-15 20:04:00,747,You caught more garbage than fish !! 
12752,nautifish,2006-12-15 23:44:00,1416,"I do think though that what you're seeing in your video isn't quite the same as littering. I don't think an angler stood there and peeled 100 feet of line of and tossed it on the ground.  I dissagree Markus.  I do not beleive for one second that all the line i picked up was from just fisherpeople getting broke off. I think some of it was left their changing setups &  getting broke off what ever,and they could not be bothered to put it in there [pockets or a bag carry it out and dipose of it the proper way. Way to much of it.  But that is besides the point, The point of this thread is people need to take better care and have more respect. Did anyone else bother to pick it up and take it out? Do you think that line had only been sat there for a short time>? Do you think no other persons stumbled across that mess aswell as the rest of the crap i saw on my walks before i came across it?   I am thinking that yes they probably did come across it. I know because the footprints in the mud before i got there told me so. & where was it still?   Amo, the common ""clean up your garbage"" and ""respect the enviornment"" rants are always well recieved amongst the angling comunity.   & I sure hope it is not allways just well recieved amongst the angling community.   Happy fishing   * where is my duck>?   lol"
12772,fishindevil,2006-12-16 00:34:00,6254,thats a very good rant...i love it..its to bad the people that left the crap all over cant see that video....
12797,wishn4fishn,2006-12-16 01:41:00,108,"""You caught more garbage then fish""  Actually that pike was thrown out and left to rot inside the bag.  Who does such a thing???  But in between fish i picked up some trash.  Good day bottom fishing at Mountsberg Cons.  Here's the biggest bass of the day "
12945,nautifish,2006-12-16 17:19:00,1416,Nice Bass  Wish i was fishing today But alas i am heading to work...BLECH!!
14080,holdfast,2006-12-19 16:39:00,1813,"Yea I know what it feels like to sit or stand in someone elses trash.  Im no goody too shoes but I have to put on a pair of gloves and pick up Butts/Beer Cans and Caps etc.  I just cant stand sitting there at a camp fire with a beer and looking at Garbage around me.  It Irks me, seems I carry back more than what I came in.  Also Sh33333t paper, at least bury it.  I always carry a bucket/Garbage bag inside and its my instant throne.  Of course that goes out with the rest of my garbage.  By the way that music sucks in the video.  gave me flash backs of last Canada day in Wasaga Beach seeing all those Italian and non Canadian Flags. Thats another rant though"
14089,tonyb,2006-12-19 17:10:00,1637,"It is anglers that leave trash behind, hook packs, float packs, old roe containers, worm containers, etc.  I think it's time hefty deposits are put on everything, $5 deposit on a worm container or timmies cup.  I guarantee you see a lot more people picking up these items for the cash deposit, and a lot less people tossing these things away since it would be the equivalent of throwing money away.  Smart solutions are the key  Tony"
14093,Nemo,2006-12-19 17:16:00,727,Yep unfortunately you need to pack a trash bag in your tackle box when you go out to some places.
14174,fishergirl72,2006-12-19 20:06:00,455,"Great thread Nautifish!  Nothing makes me so mad when I see people littering and not caring what it does for this earth or for our wildlife for that matter. I have always taught my kids that garbage goes in a grabage pail and not on the ground and if I see them litter, WATCH OUT! Mommy won't be happy at all. Littering really makes me see red."
16393,nautifish,2006-12-27 16:11:00,1416,Nothing makes me so mad when I see people littering and not caring what it does for this earth or for our wildlife for that matter.  Could not agree more hon & see you on friday @ the swill....Looking forward to it.
12369,nautifish,2006-12-15 03:23:00,1416,"Well i headed out early am this morning. Fished for several hrs in different spots & locations and nothing. I guess it was pretty much the same for the other guy's i spoke to on my travels.  Anyway i decided to do a short video Because i was discusted with what i saw today. I guess you could say its my little rant. But it really does Anger me to see people leave so much garbage and crap behind by our tribs & lakes. With the Amount of garbage i saw today and picked up i probably could have filmed a whole hour and i am not kidding.   I think it is totally discusting and some people out there need to have better respect for the inviroment.  Okay thats off my chest, I think.....lol  http://www.zippyvideos.com/953239518641221...ent/*amolicious"
12373,kemper,2006-12-15 03:34:00,2232,The first step to respecting it...would be spelling it properly...  but other than that I think your absolutely right!
12377,nautifish,2006-12-15 03:40:00,1416,lmao Kemper.....Yes i noticed i had put an I instead of an E after i had allready put the video togeather....lol...No way was i gonna start from scratch...Its pretty time consumeing is this video marlarky ya know.....lol
12380,kemper,2006-12-15 03:44:00,2232,"You also missed the 'n'.  But its Christmas time, so we'll let it go!"
12382,danc,2006-12-15 03:45:00,4677,  LOL. Spelling lessons at their finest.

12385,kemper,2006-12-15 03:48:00,2232," Do as I say not as I do  Yes, my typing is horrible  I really should check my own spelling before I go bashing someone elses...."
12387,danc,2006-12-15 03:53:00,4677,"Heh, heh. Have a great day Kemper."

12391,nautifish,2006-12-15 03:56:00,1416,Okay enough allready.  Blimey i was pretty niffed today after seeing all the garbage left around still niffed when i was putting this video togeather...Got it off my chest and now this post has turned into a how too spell post........   Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
12392,kemper,2006-12-15 03:57:00,2232," Same to you DanC...and might I say, that is a fine trout you have in that avatar!"
12396,wishn4fishn,2006-12-15 04:01:00,108,"Are u Rudolph's cousin, the brown nosed reindeer???"
12397,kemper,2006-12-15 04:03:00,2232,"Weve robbed a perfectly good post here folks, and it is mainly my fault.  Lets get this back on topic!  Earlier this year a board member organised a clean up of my local trib, and did quite the job, but unfortunatly it is right back to where it was! We really need more people to do their part in picking up the garbage (even though it isnt theirs) around the fishing areas. The last thing we want to be known for is leaving trash everywhere!"
12398,wishn4fishn,2006-12-15 04:07:00,108,Word.  Nauti maybe u can burn a bra and start a revolution???  Just kidding.   I do wat i can.....  
12399,nautifish,2006-12-15 04:13:00,1416,"Exactly Kemper, & Then some fisherman,woman wonder why people will not let us fish on they're private property. I have heard quiet a few rants from fisherman about not being able to fish certain spots due to it being private property & not wanting fisherman,woman on there property. Is it any wonder when you see all this crap left behind.  & Thankyou This is a serious issue, in my book it is anyway and i would like to think other people out there also.  Maybe thats what i should do is try to organize a clean up of our local tribs.     Thats great and nice too see.  I know i'm on a bit of a rant but it really did sicken me today. Were lucky to have what we have right on our very own doorsteps."
12401,kemper,2006-12-15 04:13:00,2232,"Nauti, where are you located?  If its close I would be in for a clean up!"
12404,luv2drift,2006-12-15 04:18:00,147,"I totally agree.  I would like to take it a step further and say to fishermen and hunters everywhere its not just garbage at the river we need to clean up, its our attitudes.  At the rate we are destroying the enviroment there will be zero plentiful trout rivers to fish in 40 years.  I personally made a change and now drive a more enviromentally friendly car.  Instead of the 4X4 to drive down to the river I am now in a golf tdi which goes 1150km to 50 bucks worth of diesel and I run biodiesel in the summer.  All my gear still fits in the hatch. By doing this in a small way I have pressured the big truck producers to start to produce a more efficient truck and affordable truck for the outdoorsmen.  I have in a small way taken just a little less money out of the big oil companies pocket.  And I am not dumping the emissions into the air like I would be if I was driving a truck that are causing the catastrophic global warming.  We are and need to be the stewards of the enviroment.  The fishermen are the ones that are seeing the causes of global warming and fish habitat destruction...so we need to live our lives ""greener"" than the average person!  I just hope in 2030 I can take my Grand kid fishing for trout and not Gobe.  Don't reply back and say  1. You try sticking a moose in the back of a golf 2. You try driving a golf down a logging trail 3. You try towing a boat with a golf."
12405,nautifish,2006-12-15 04:19:00,1416,I Live in a fabulous place called Port Dover Kemper. But i was not fishing in PD Today i was fishing another erea but not too far from Dover. About a 30 minute drive away. It really is a very beautiful erea & its such a shame that some people just do not seem to care.
12408,wishn4fishn,2006-12-15 04:22:00,108,"Actually that's all the garbage i brought with me, just demonstrating a point of cleaning up after yourself.  Some areas are really bad.  Coffee cups and trash ain't half as bad as broken beer bottles and dead battery's."
12409,kemper,2006-12-15 04:24:00,2232,"  Ive been to Dover a few times, nice place. Unfortunatly youre a little far from whitby for a trib cleanup! lol"
12410,Mike the Pike,2006-12-15 04:24:00,3421,Well said Nautifish
12412,bigfish1965,2006-12-15 04:25:00,3382,"It is sad when we see people with no regard for the natural environment. Since anglers are the most visible near the water we are the ones who usually are blamed for it. It is important that we be seen doing things that affect the outdoors in a positive way. If someone here ( a member..mods are already way too busy) were to take the reigns on organizing clean-up days, I'm sure OFC could assist with web space and time."
12415,nautifish,2006-12-15 04:29:00,1416,  Ohh trust me what i had on film was nothing. Like i allready said i could have made a video an hour long just on garbage on my travels by the water today.  LUV2DRIFT...Kudo's to you and i agree Some people do need to change their attitudes.  I hope that when i become a grandparent they will be able to fish with me and love it as much i do.
12416,wishn4fishn,2006-12-15 04:30:00,108,"TREE HUGGERS UNITE!!!  I always carry my backpack with me and there's always room for a lil garbage wrapped in a shopping bag, plus there's garbage cans everywhere that you can just drop it off.  So what's your excuse for not being responsible for the irresponsible??"
