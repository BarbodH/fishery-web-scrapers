16333,lew,2006-12-27 11:58:00,12767,"According to the long range forecast on the TV Weather Network this morning, the temps are staying above freezing for the near future, infact climbing to +13 by January 10th.  Not looking good for icefishers/skiers/snowmobilers  Course, we can't put too much faith in what the weatherman says"
16334,Whopper,2006-12-27 12:10:00,2174,"This has been a strange winter so far that's for sure, last week was out in sweatshirt this week it is cold and wet, this coming weekend looks like it's going to be warm again. I know all the guys that want ice are disappointed, just wish it would get here so we can it over with  .  Whopper"
16335,Handlebarz,2006-12-27 12:13:00,3790,this has been a crazy fall and now maybe no winter either I just wish that the river and lake could clear enough so the fish might be able to see what they are eating.
16336,Eddyk,2006-12-27 12:43:00,195,Woke up yesterday morning in Delta {south of Ottawa } and found 3 inches of snow on the ground.
16337,Terry,2006-12-27 12:44:00,14456,"hey, there is always a Jan. thaw...    well..I guess you need ice to have a thaw"
16338,Greencoachdog,2006-12-27 12:48:00,8163,Sounds like it's time to load the boat up and go fishin' to me!!!
16352,Tdel,2006-12-27 14:07:00,393,"Big soft snowflakes are slowly drifting to the ground now Lew and starting to stay.  I use to like seeing those big, soft snow flakes slowly drift to the ground, so quiet and peaceful.   But not anymore, I have been spoiled and don't want the real winter to come back.  I figure if we can go this far without serious snow then there is no need to start now.   If the weather network is correct then we aren't going to get much and once again the ""warmer"" temperatures should take it away.  The 14 day trend for this area on Jan 10 is only about +1C.  Of course we are a little north of the banana belt.   Tom"
16357,setomonkey,2006-12-27 14:22:00,872,"Winter weather might be late this year but I'm sure it'll get here, if not in January then February and March...  No need for the ice-fishers to panic yet!  Mike"
16358,OhioFisherman,2006-12-27 14:24:00,6623,"Never was much of a fan of snow and ice, less so now that I don`t walk well, 47f here tomorrow. Love it ! Starting to look like I got to much firewood."
16367,Fish Farmer,2006-12-27 14:46:00,2234,"I'm running a ice fishing bus trip for Jan 28 47 guys, I'm starting to sweat."
