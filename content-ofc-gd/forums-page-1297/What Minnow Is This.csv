16080,FishFinder,2006-12-25 19:01:00,481,Just wondering what kind of minnow this is..  
16082,G-loomis,2006-12-25 19:09:00,19,it is either a emerald shinner or a shinner.
16084,fishindevil,2006-12-25 19:13:00,6254,"i think its shinner,  will have to find my baitfish book,and look it up,but i think thats what they are,i know walleyes like them for sure"
16094,Spiel,2006-12-25 21:07:00,9065,"....Definitely a shiner, likely the common shiner found in most creeks and rivers."
16095,FishFinder,2006-12-25 21:25:00,481,"thanks for the help, my local creek has thousands of these and i just wanted to make sure what they were before i used them as bait..."
16098,wishn4fishn,2006-12-25 22:02:00,108,really bored eh???
16107,FishFinder,2006-12-25 22:41:00,481,yeah pretty much lol
16110,OhioFisherman,2006-12-25 23:24:00,6623,"I used to catch them in the creeks off of lake erie here I called them silver shiners, don`t know the proper name. Longer and thicker bodied than an emerald shiner, LOL good bait!"
16125,Greencoachdog,2006-12-26 01:33:00,8163,"Is that a ""Garden Hackle"" fly you're usin' for bait???"
16135,xrap,2006-12-26 03:03:00,683,"It's a normal shinner, always catch a bunch of them in the creek near my house in the summer. If you ice fish then maybe you should freeze a couple for pike. They work very well."
16136,FishFinder,2006-12-26 03:19:00,481,xrap do you salt them or just straight out freeze them? thanks..
16137,Rich,2006-12-26 03:34:00,3927,"Definitely not an emerald shiner, but it is a shiner of some sort."
16146,xrap,2006-12-26 05:26:00,683,Nope just straight into a ziploc bag and then freeze them
16147,joonmoon,2006-12-26 05:50:00,528,If you add coarse salt before freezing then it won't get all mushy when you go to use it for Pike.
16167,Carp,2006-12-26 15:41:00,1488,"Looks like the type of minnow that catches fish.  Seriously, it looks like some sort of shiner as mentioned already."
16176,BUSTER,2006-12-26 16:27:00,1336,that  is a spottail shiner
16227,verno,2006-12-26 21:31:00,178,Rob Hyatt.  Someone had to do it.
