1034747,Tjames09,2018-10-05 16:22:00,664,"I think the blue stabil marine is meant for every fill up to prevent ethanol damage. I use the blue stabil very tank of gas. Red stabil for storage. Lots of fuel has ethanol in it, even 91 octane, only a few stations 91 is ethanol free."
1034766,aplumma,2018-10-05 20:30:00,6896,The fuel treatments work 2 ways first it creates a barrier between air and the fuel in the tank much like oil floats on water. This barrier cut down or stops water absorption into the ethanol in the fuel. It also encapsulates the water in the fuel and allows it to be processed thru the fuel system. If you get a slug of water in the fuel no product will separate the alcohol and the water it will settle to the bottom of the tank and the fuel pick up will send it to the carburetor/ efi. Art
1034768,Old Man,2018-10-05 21:08:00,822,"I’ve use Marine Grade Stabil in all my motors, both 2 stroke and 4 stroke, on every fill (fifteen motors in total) for the past 11 years. Never have had a fuel related issue. Well worth it in my opinion. "
1034631,captpierre,2018-10-02 21:21:00,2521,Didn’t know the latter existed. I use regular gas during the summer for my Yammy 115 4 Str. Then in September I let tank get low then start using premium ethanol free in preparation for winter storage. Have always used regular Sta-bil with no issues. 11 yrs. Both on sale at CT. 360 Marine a bit more $.
1034636,Fisherman,2018-10-03 00:46:00,7201,"SeaFoam. I used the regular Stabil a few years ago in a 2 stroke mix, following spring there was a mass of blue goop at the bottom of the gas can, sort of like runny honey. I'll never use that again."
1034638,KraTToR,2018-10-03 02:00:00,506,"Neither, I""m still fishin'... ?"
1034640,chris.brock,2018-10-03 02:24:00,4053,"I use regular Stabil and have always had good results, maybe water or ethanol Fisherman? My question would be what is the shelf life of the stuff? For something as important as that, I always buy a new bottle and now have a bunch older, half empty bottles."
1034643,Fisherman,2018-10-03 09:04:00,7201,"No water, non ethanol gas, maybe it was the shelf life."
1034644,Garnet,2018-10-03 10:01:00,2056,The last time I checked Sta-bil  had 60 days shelf life. Not enough here. Seafoam has no shelf life so I've  been using it. This might be redundant because  I only use Shell gas in my boat lawnmowers. The truck gets the cheap stuff. 
1034646,fishindevil,2018-10-03 11:26:00,6254,been using seafom in all my boats and sleds for years never a problem.....and yes I only run premium fuel as well....
1034649,Sinker,2018-10-03 12:35:00,8692,"Seafoam for me too. It does a lot more than just stabilize the fuel, it cleans the whole fuel system, and the exaust as well, decarbs pistons and rings....its great stuff.  "
1034651,bigbuck,2018-10-03 14:03:00,2449,Stabil. I use it from Labour Day weekend on. Seafoam  is more of a cleaner than a stabilizer.
1034652,RickOnt,2018-10-03 14:11:00,669,"This is what I thought also. fishindevil, Sinker  Please inform me Thanks Rick"
1034657,Garnet,2018-10-03 16:40:00,2056,Somebody will do the search. We had this discussion last year and the spec where Seafoam  is a fuel stabilizer.
1034658,aplumma,2018-10-03 17:33:00,6896,Stabil 360 marine is designed to keep a barrier between the fuel surface and the air. It also will help with corrosion of the tank more so than sta bil. I use it always no matter what time of year or whether two and four stoke. A note the two stroke oil can come out of solution if allowed to set for long periods of time. Always give it a shake no matter what brand you use. Art
1034659,JoshS,2018-10-03 17:34:00,729,"Does anyone know for sure if seafoam can stabilize to the extent of stabil? If so seems like stabil is inferior and Seafoam is the better product to use. I sometimes run both, seafoam a couple times a year to clean crap out and stabil when I need to stabilize. But I really have no idea what I'm doing lol, in terms of the facts on what actually works the best. Don't like the sounds of what Fisherman says above... "
1034660,smitty55,2018-10-03 17:53:00,928,Seafoam will stabilize fuel for up to two years. It also prevents phase separation which can happen using ethanol fuels.  Cheers
1034661,grimsbylander,2018-10-03 17:54:00,3016,"I know it's most likely overkill but I use both. I run regular fuel in my 2 stroke and since it's EFI, it's straight fuel in the tank. I got in the habit of always using Seafoam as a cleaning agent as opposed to a stabilizer and using Stabil as the stabilizer. So in the fall, I up the Stabil ratio and back off a bit on the Seafoam. Just my $0.02."
1034662,Fisherman,2018-10-03 17:56:00,7201,"From the Seafoam site: Sea Foam helps to stabilize stored fuel for up to two years by resisting evaporation, preserving ignition vapors, and preventing the formation of gum and varnish.  Hahaha, Smitty types faster than me."
1034664,RickOnt,2018-10-03 18:07:00,669,"Well!  There ya go,  Seafoam does stabilize. Thanks Guys"
1034669,captpierre,2018-10-03 20:13:00,2521,The skeptic in me knows that manufacturers  can make all kinds of claims on these types of products without having to provide proof. “Helps” is very vague. Might help 1%. You have no idea. Us mere mortals are stuck in the middle between slick marketing and facts.
1034670,grimsbylander,2018-10-03 20:18:00,3016,"And why I use both....plus, Seafoam cleans fuel systems very nicely."
1034673,Cosmos,2018-10-04 00:50:00,588,I used to use Seafoam. Switched to Amsoil stabilizer. Still use seafoam for both my vechiles in fall and spring to cleanup fuel system. I am steong believer in seafoam products and big fan of amsoil.
1034676,smitty55,2018-10-04 02:55:00,928,Seafoam's history goes back decades before it hit the general consumer market in your local ctc or auto shop but it's been around since the 30's when it was developed for the marine industry. The American military has used it for ages so you know it must be good. Btw the DeepCreep is an excellent penetrant for rusted bolts.  Cheers
1034685,Mister G,2018-10-04 12:14:00,1429,I ONLY use Evinrude's 2+4 Fuel Treatment in my E-TEC outboard with so far excellent results. https://domo-online.com/Fuel-Additives/Evinrude-2-4-Fuel-Treatment  BTW I have seen Stabil turn in the bottle so I stopped using it in my boat but do use it in the lawn mower and snow eater.....
1034690,Sinker,2018-10-04 14:25:00,8692,"Well, I can tell you it has never hurt my engine. I have a 1993 Yamaha/mariner that gets seafoam added to every bit of gas that goes in the tank. I can't even guess how many hours are on my engine.....thousands? Maybe tens of thousands? Its a lot. I've never once in all those years had a fuel issue. In fact, all ive ever done was replace the  original fuel line from the tank, replace the impeller a couple times, change lower unit oil, and new plugs every once in a while. I swear by seafoam, the stuff just plain works.  I've been running it hard for 25 years this season, and it runs just the same now as it did when I first got it. It really makes it hard to justify a new engine, even though I want one LOL  I'm not saying its better than anything else, just that I have a lot of years of good experience with using it.  S."
1034730,buick14,2018-10-05 11:17:00,741,"Snake oil a vs snake oil b I know I personally saw no difference using original stabil back when , but I have been using seafoam the last several years for some reason.  A big difference for me was when I made sure I stored my equipment properly and started using premium eth free.  But the snake oil placebo effect is definitely there for me too...."
1034733,captpierre,2018-10-05 13:10:00,2521,Yup. I would love to hear from a fuel chemical engineer type to get the facts.
