1015640,BillM,2017-10-16 13:21:00,17367,What are you planning on fishing for?
1015643,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-16 13:41:00,8243,"Hi Justin and welcome to OFC. Why not give us a bit of an intro about yourself and what you like to fish for, where, when and all that. Like Bill asked what do you want to catch?  Is that better? That's an inside thing Justin, not asking you."
1015645,AKRISONER,2017-10-16 14:06:00,5558,im just gonna assume yellow bucket brigade until otherwise posted
1015650,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-16 14:43:00,8243,I've heard of the white bucket brigade but not the yellow brigade.
1015655,BillM,2017-10-16 15:33:00,17367,Is the yellow bucket brigade the guys getting busted by the MNR for keeping over their limit of escapees?  lol
1015658,AKRISONER,2017-10-16 17:15:00,5558,lmao exactly
1015660,justin5493,2017-10-16 17:19:00,3,"I live in Penetanguishene . I heard there are trout and salmon at Depot Harbour, but i'm open to catch anything. thanks"
1015661,justin5493,2017-10-16 17:21:00,3,what are the seasons there? is it a sanctuary aswell???
1015663,BillM,2017-10-16 18:20:00,17367,No salmon there.  And yes there's a sanctuary nearby.  Only thing you'll be fishing for this time of year at depot would be escapee rainbow trout.

1034598,S.J,2018-10-01 18:55:00,2,"I went out this weekend to explore fishing at depot harbor. It was my first time going there, got my 1 day fishing permit  costed $10 at 6:45am from the office situated at the start of bridge. The staff was very nice and friendly. Around 7:00 am I started fishing, and tried Pautzke salmon eggs. I was not been able to catch any rainbow but hooked a massive pike using Pautzke  salmon egg around 8:30 am, the pike was too big to fit in my medium size net, and was around 45 inch long.  I tried couple of spots at pier but no luck until 11:00 am and I decided to call it day.   	I believe that relying solely on escaped fish from nearby cages is not a good idea because, first of all you don't know if any fish really has escaped and how many escaped or even the escaped fish is still in this area.  At least, I didn't see any rainbow near by that would have escaped from cage, probably, they have improved the cages quality over last few years.  I will give a try again around December or January/march and will post an update.  Cheers SJ"
1034603,BillM,2018-10-02 01:32:00,17367,"If you wanna fish escapees then you're best bet is to buy fish food from the store on the res before going in.   Also, you'll wanna chum those stupid things as well. Anyone else catching anything?   Usually it's either hot or dead."
1034629,S.J,2018-10-02 20:28:00,2,"Thanks Bill, I didn't know that there was a store that sells fish food. Is it the same office on the bridge that provides fish permit?"
1034641,BillM,2018-10-03 02:26:00,17367,"I got my permit at Island Gas and Variety.  It's about halfway to Depot.   You can also ask the guys at the fishery as well for some, they're pretty cool."
