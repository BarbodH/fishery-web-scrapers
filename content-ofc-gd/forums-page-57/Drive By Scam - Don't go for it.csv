1034367,Fisherman,2018-09-22 21:44:00,7201,"No doubt there are some gullible ones out there.  I got into my truck sat there for a couple minutes and watched him circle through the parking lot for a victim.  Bad thing is, I don't think it's illegal until the transaction has completed, (maybe fraud)."
1034369,chris.brock,2018-09-22 22:05:00,4053,"It might not be illegal at all. It's a transaction both parties agree on. Fraud if he claims it's a Breitling or something and it's a fake. What's the tax/ duty on stuff like that? It can't be so much that it's worthwhile for him to sell stuff for 10 cents on the dollar, lol.  I hate crap like that, get a job you snake"

Selling leather jackets that had been at a fashion show near the airport and didn’t want to take them back to Italy! I can tell you bad Italian words, just in case."
