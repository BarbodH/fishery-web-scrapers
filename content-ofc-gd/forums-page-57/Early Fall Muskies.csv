Enjoy. "

Sunday was a tough one here, lost one, caught a bunch of pike but snapped off an $80 bait and $10 leader.  You did better. lol.  Christine and I were chatting about you in the boat for a minute."

1034519,BillM,2018-09-28 13:14:00,17367,Nice man!   I was out hunting skis the other day.   Had one blow up because I wasn't paying attention like an idiot (didn't figure 8 that one cast and paid for it) Although I did get a nice bucket on a double 10!  lol.  That was a bit of a shocker.
