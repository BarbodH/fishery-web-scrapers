1033996,Victor,2018-09-14 05:07:00,1609,Thanks for sharing. I miss carp fishing and hearing the screaming alarms.
1034031,Kokemachine,2018-09-15 05:31:00,8,No problem. Yeah I only get to go carp fishing once a year. I love how it always goes from 0 to 60 when using a bolt rig.
1034119,Mike Pike,2018-09-17 17:54:00,1332,"Thanks looks like a great place chill and catch carp.  Perfect even!  Almost lost the rod on that one take, eh?  lol Thanks the video, Guys! "
1034145,Kokemachine,2018-09-18 12:22:00,8,Thanks for the good words Mike!  It keeps things pretty exiting when you almost lose your gear on a take. We all had our drags set to zero but they were still almost taking our rods into the lake.
1034297,Beans,2018-09-20 21:50:00,3339,You and me too Victor...last time was three years ago when my son caught one below the pump house over twenty pounds... Nobody fishing there now or chumming... I guess the carp moved on...

1034368,Mike Pike,2018-09-22 21:49:00,1332,Carp jerky?  Who knew!!!
1034376,Kokemachine,2018-09-23 02:31:00,8,The pictures make it look pretty tastey. I've brined and smoked a few other kinds of fish so I. Imagine it would be quite tastey.
