1033594,gordy28,2018-09-07 13:37:00,638,I hear ya Chris Its a long wait but with kids all into sports and just busy summers its a combo of budget and time Theres been talk of a smaller trip in the off years - maybe a 4 nighter to Lady Evelyn again or just renting a private cottage But yeah - I would love to do one every year even a few lol Andrew
1034148,pics,2018-09-18 17:05:00,1268,Those are some good sized walleye.. I don't have the money for a fly in but I have some pretty good drive to lakes up that way.. Heading up in 10 days for some Grouse and fishing..
1034197,Moosebunk,2018-09-19 12:55:00,3970,"Great to enjoy with a morning coffee Andrew.  Surely gets me missing the days on the rivers and lakes north, walleye are always a fun social fish, especially in numbers like 100 or even just 99 a day.   The right group of people though, and it's trips like this one that keep ya going back for more."
1034203,gordy28,2018-09-19 13:39:00,638,"Thanks Bunk - certainly your posts from Pym and Kesagami back in the day were a big inspiration to us when we first decided to do fly ins  - its funny I can still say to my brother ""we need to find our grocery store"" and he knows exactly what I mean. Many of those who posted reports and still do (Yourself, Mike B/Solo Paddler, Chris Brock) have always been both entertaining but also totally education for us - keep it up! Thanks - we were definitely impressed with the average size of the fish North of Nakina vs what we had experienced around White RIver (although my PB walleye and our groups PB walleye came from a small lake with White River Air on our first fly in)  Cheers Andrew "
