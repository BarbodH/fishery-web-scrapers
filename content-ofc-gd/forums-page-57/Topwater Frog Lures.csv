Just curious if anyone has tried the hybrid frogs in this FFTROU video? They have weedless treble hooks which I have not tried yet. But it's interesting that it can be a multi purpose lure. Is it worth the switch? Thanks.

Maybe they're ok for smaller bass but if you stick a 5lb+ fish in cover, those trebles will straighten right up. I'd stick to a traditional weedless frog with 4.0 or 5.0 hooks instead. Secondly, a pop-R would do the same thing and is also a fantastic open water bait. Finally, the glo-sticks with the little trap door...well, it'll catch a LOT of fisherman. Overall, I would say the gent in the video is liking the frog mainly because he's using the wrong rod/reel setup and the trebles hooks allow him to bury the thin wire hooks. If that's the motivation, buy some weedless trebles and switch out the hooks on a pop R."

I still like my regular frog cause it is pretty weedless when retrieving. I'm still pretty new to fishing and haven't tried to use a pop r before. I'm very limited on the lures I use/buy and some can be a bit pricey.
