""The new fish and wildlife licensing service that we are launching in November will make getting outdoors easier for hunters and anglers. The service will be easy to use, with new features like a mobile Licence Summary and a single Outdoors Card,” said Jeff Yurek, minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. To support transition to the new service, there will be two planned service interruptions: Plan ahead: all 2018 licences requiring a game seal need to be purchased before Nov. 19, 2018. As of Jan. 1, 2019 – all hunting and fishing licences will be available for purchase during their regular timeframes. For all the information you need about fishing and hunting licences in Ontario, please visit here."

1034468,Mike Pike,2018-09-26 15:16:00,1332,"That's the way it was sold to all of us in the 80s, as I recall too Dave. I believe that in BC, about half the revenue from fishing licences goes directly back to the fishery."
1034480,John Bacon,2018-09-26 20:48:00,3277,"From what I understand, the license revenue is used to fund fisheries.  However, our fisheries were well funded before the licences were introduced.  The license revenue was supposed to be over and above the existing funding that came out of general revenues.  But, in the end, license revenue has replaced, not added to, funding from general revenues."
