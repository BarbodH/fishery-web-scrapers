I know there are other options but not sure what else might work as good for me. Usually fishing in small creeks/rivers.  Also, just wanted to share this video from FFTROU since they covered inflated worms earlier this year. Tight lines! "
1034270,BillM,2018-09-20 14:20:00,17367,Nothing like ditch fishing for scruffy steelhead.
1034271,Garnet,2018-09-20 14:38:00,2056,Nothing like self promotion.

1034395,grimsbylander,2018-09-24 01:27:00,3016,"Hey! Now that you mention it I saw guys down there with cameras one day. Didn't look like fishing, it looked more likeÂ they were shooting an episode of Ozarks."
1034625,FishGuy3754,2018-10-02 19:31:00,23,"So far the only things I've tried for trout were inflated worms with a bottom rig like this video and some small bobber fishing. I heard from a friends father he's used some small insect baits and flys before for trout and did ok.  	Also I have fished some small rivers or ""ditches"" but to me it's more about just enjoying nature and whatever kind of water you find yourself on. I live near a small feeder creek that only really has minnows in it and even just fishing for some minnows can be a relaxing time."
