Question on the Pump - does it short out, etc. if it is under water and running?  I am guessing no - but figured I would ask.  Right now, when I turn it on, the Circuit Breaker will pop after a second or so.  At this point I don't know if I have to replace it.  I am thinking it may have sucked something into the Intake.  I have never worked on one of these before, so any suggestions on what to look for would be great.  It is a Smokercraft Pro Mag 182."
1034047,OhioFisherman,2018-09-15 15:28:00,6623,"I don't believe the pump will stop working when under water, but if your wiring to it is under water also it might, a bilge pump that stops working when submerged defeats the purpose?"
1034048,misfish,2018-09-15 15:35:00,29133,"You have a short in the wire,or something is in the pump. Not sure you can take them apart. Sealed units. Check for nics in the wire.  If no nics,then new pump. Unless you think you can seal it up proper after taking it apart."
1034052,Garnet,2018-09-15 16:32:00,2056,Most are cartage style now. And most boats have 4 or more. So   get somebody to flick switches and you touch each one until you ID bilge.  There are 3 kind yellow are Mayfare white Atwood blue and red I forget mostly on Stratos. You can  just turn and they will pop out. Could be fishing line plastic baits or just burned out.
1034053,hutch4113,2018-09-15 17:42:00,374,"Thanks.  That is what I am guessing - something inside or it burnt out.  I will try to get to it this week.  Mine is (from what I can remember) mostly white with some blue on it (I think).  Might be time for a new one anyway, as I don't think the current unit has an auto shut off."
1034421,hutch4113,2018-09-25 17:43:00,374,"Thanks for the suggestions.  It was a cartridge style, and once I figured out how to pop it out, it was easy.  Motor was fine - there was some fishing line wrapped around wheel, which is why the breaker was popping ?. I wonder who left fishing line in the Bilge ?"
1034427,Cast-Away,2018-09-25 19:41:00,790,"Just a suggestion, i always keep a spare plug in the glove box of my boat."
