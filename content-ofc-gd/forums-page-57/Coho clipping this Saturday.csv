Plan is to clip on either Sat Sept 29 or Sunday Sept 30. IF you are available either day and wish to help can you send me an email with when you are able to do so.  Firm commitments only please.  Also, Please pass along request to anyone you feel may be willing to help. The more help we have the easier it is on everyone. Final logistics will be sent out prior – once we know when we can have the most manpower available. It will likely take a full day to clip all the Coho…. Lunch is provided."""
