1034717,Terry,2018-10-04 21:32:00,14456,Hey When did you have time to go fishing.  Lol nice catch
1034718,spincast,2018-10-04 21:35:00,3279,why do I think those two have an appointment with the smoke house on the weekend? nice fish  
1034719,misfish,2018-10-04 22:32:00,29133,"Had an opening . 6-8 am, back a couple of weeks ago,  They did, and they were delish."
1034723,OhioFisherman,2018-10-05 00:11:00,6623,"Brian, steelhead? not lakers? never had lake trout, how much difference in taste?"
1034724,Fisherman,2018-10-05 00:31:00,7201,"I'll take rainbow over a laker any day, almost like comparing your favourite potato chips to having to eat turnips or brussel sprouts. ?"
1034746,misfish,2018-10-05 16:10:00,29133,"Hey Paul Lakers I will only smoke.  Steel head is nice, broiled,pouched and smoked.  I like turnip and brussel spouts. ?"
1034749,OhioFisherman,2018-10-05 16:34:00,6623,"Brian, my experience with trout is very limited, they were just incidental catches while smallie fishing on Lake Erie and only Steelhead. I kept a couple over the years for a table test, broiled in butter with some lemon pepper seasoning and thought they were pretty good. Never really went out of my way to fish for trout, although the steelhead were fun, you knew pretty quickly it wasn't a bass."
