Joey secretly took up a collection among some board members without me knowing anything about it and had Pamela paint the picture then her and Paul showed up at my house one evening and presented me with the picture. One of the most thoughtful gifts I've ever received and Joey was one of the nicest people I ever had the honor of calling  a good friend.

Right away joined three or four sites...this is the one that stuck over the years. Was in that picture from the 2004 G2G at Lakair that mepps posted, and made it to one or two after that but not in a long time.  Nice to see those pictures but also a bit sentimental when you think of those you've met who are no longer with us"

1034262,Moosebunk,2018-09-20 03:45:00,3970,"Started on FishOntario in 2002, added Fish-Hawk in 2003 as it was basically home turf waters that most there were posting about, and later started lurking here in 04 I think, came on about 05/06 and joined NAA, RB's and YRF about then too.  All have basically died, with F-H likely to be the next. Soooooooooo many people have come and gone but some still really stand out for each of us when you see their names.  It would be great to hear how old members are doing, I always like reports, and guys like say Cookslav's spring Algonquin trips, Tony or Aaron's summer salmon days, Ramble's backwoods tours, etc, etc. are the types of personal fishing reports and stories which I always felt fueled me to read more.   Steve posted the names Pameladellaire and Mepps as well.  Pam years back sent me a print of one of her paintings.  She had painted it from a picture I had taken of a cabin on Hancock Creek outside of Moosonee.  Couple months ago I was looking at it here at home and happily remembering that kind gesture and the fact she used to post her paintings here.  Well, she fell off the face of the earth, like many people actually do from these sites, except that some of us for whatever reason never forget them.  And Joey!!! How could any of us forget her, she was beautiful with everyone here and off site as well.  Doesn't matter how old this place is, the next person or post that could have some impact on your life could happen any time."

925987,Roy,2015-07-24 09:08:00,13728,"Yeah...there are pitfalls when trying to change some less desirable words to more acceptable ones. One of the more famous was the word ""s-h-i-t"" that we changed to ""poop"". Harmless enough we thought. Well, until the day someone wrote Cliff's (CCMT) full name in a post. It was unfortunate that his surname came out as ""Terapoopa"" . I do believe that TJ is still laughing. Good natured Cliff took it in stride. Bless his pointy lil' ears."

As for my yellow jacket, it now lives in St. Lucia. I was wearing it on a fishing charter. Junior (the boat captain) didn't take his eyes off of it. At the end of the day I gave him the jacket.  In turn I got Barracuda steaks and the address of a local restaurant that would cook it up for us. ""The St Lucian way"" Junior called the owner and set up the time for us to meet up there. What a great day and night we had. Cathy and I were the only non St Lucian's there and man can they party!!!

925603,porkpie,2015-07-21 22:02:00,2521,"Zoology board was around before OFC, that was Andy's old site.  It ended when he retired from U of T.  I found this place from that one.  Have lurked ever since, really just started posting on here in the last 5 years, but read it since the beginning."
925604,Big Cliff,2015-07-21 22:18:00,6899,When did T.J. get involved (take it over)?
925606,Cast-Away,2015-07-21 22:26:00,790,Wow this is pretty cool. Bigfish1965 was Rick O I believe.  I to went from the zooboard to here
925607,misfish,2015-07-21 22:31:00,29133,FishHeadRic was a real cool dude. Hope he is doing well.

925611,lew,2015-07-21 22:51:00,12766,"I'd never touched a computer in my life until 2002 and knew absolutely nothing about them, infact I had little interest in them.  My wife had one though and I decided maybe I should see what it was all about. She showed me the basics and said I could probably find some stuff about fishing. I started putzing around and came across the ""the real fishing"" website and started following links.....although back then I had no idea what a link was.  Eventually it led me to the OFC site and it seemed kinda interesting so I started reading it and decided this computer stuff was pretty good.  Been hanging around ever since.  And howcum everytime I type OF...""ENN""...it comes up as OFC ??"
925615,Steve,2015-07-21 22:59:00,2075,a legal reason from occurrences back in the day (at least I believe).

OMG, We had to type in the whole address link thing.  What was it,  [img/] insert image[img/]  IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING.  But look at what this place did.  Family we never even knew we had."
925619,Sinker,2015-07-21 23:19:00,8692,I started on the fishing boards around '02.

OMG, We had to type in the whole address link thing.    I had no clue how to post pictures either Brian and used to take my prints to some joint in Toronto called ...I think...computer cafe or something like that. They'd scan them and email them to Cory who in turn posted them on the board for me.  My computer skills still haven't improved much since those days but at least now I can post the odd picture"
