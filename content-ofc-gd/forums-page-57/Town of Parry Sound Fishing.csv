1034578,BillM,2018-10-01 00:01:00,17367,No salmon in the sound and lakers close as of midnight tonight.   Bass will probably be deep chasing bait.   Tough gig without a boat but ya never know.
1034587,huzzsaba,2018-10-01 14:58:00,884,Thanks  BillM.  I think I will stick with fishing oastler lake exclusively.
1034590,AKRISONER,2018-10-01 16:52:00,5558,"very tough place to try catch one this time of year. Might run into the odd stray pike or a smallie up shallow eating gobies, but it would definitely be a tough gig without the ability to get off shore."
1034599,huzzsaba,2018-10-01 19:55:00,884,Thanks Akrisoner.  Will stick oastler lake with my inflatable boat
1034639,BillM,2018-10-03 02:18:00,17367,"If washing lures is your goal, then definitely go out to Parry Sound salmon fishing.   I know a guy that's fished PS for 20+ years, he's boated exactly 1 salmon in the sound off the Salt docks. Closest place would be the mouth of 12 Mile Bay downrigging."
1034667,huzzsaba,2018-10-03 19:31:00,884,Planning to just fish oastler lake. Supposedly they stock rainbow trout there. would be nice to catch some of those. weather is cooling down so hopefully the are not down deep.
1034683,AKRISONER,2018-10-04 12:06:00,5558,"theres an MNR stats pull that they did on presumed salmon catches in north eastern G bay...I am pretty sure it was less than 100 total for an entire year...There used to be salmon fishing, but the population has intentionally collapsed. I dont know why you would even bother trying for them when the lake trout fishing is so damn good."
