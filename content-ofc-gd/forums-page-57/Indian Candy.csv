1034563,huzzsaba,2018-09-30 14:59:00,884,Looks very tasty!  Curious is there any way to make them the same way without a smoker?
1034566,porkpie,2018-09-30 16:51:00,2521,"You can do a passable job with a BBQ using a smoke box.  Use one burner, on low and place the stainless steel smoke box over it.  Put the fish on the off heat side.  Only dampen some of the wood chips not all, or it will take forever to smoke.  For best results, take your drill and punch a bunch more holes in the smoke box.  It won't be the same as the stuff that comes out of the smoker, but it's not bad!"
