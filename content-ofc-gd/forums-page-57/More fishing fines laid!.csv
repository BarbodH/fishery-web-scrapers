1034324,Fisherman,2018-09-21 12:59:00,7201,They live by their own rules.
1034327,jimmer,2018-09-21 13:31:00,2730,"Absolutely disgusting. The courts need to start throwing the book at people who abuse our resources. Maybe even jail time.  Others will say it's just a fish, but the money generated from the fishery is huge, so I say the judges need to set some stronger prescidence."
1034330,Rizzo,2018-09-21 13:46:00,4754,rotten buggers. Probably won't ever pay the fine either. I hope at least their gear is confiscated right at the site.
1034333,Moosebunk,2018-09-21 14:32:00,3970,"Only thing that stands out as extraordinary here is that TheKawarthaAngler needs to change his name to just KawarthaAngler so that his profile can fit that dropped ""r"" into place with the rest of his name.  Just a bit of OCD here for ya. lol"
1034334,grimsbylander,2018-09-21 14:43:00,3016,"The article should have read...""Five anglers shot for fishing in fish sanctuary in Peterborough at Lock 19"" Either way they lose their equipment"
1034335,John,2018-09-21 14:46:00,2956,Unfortunately nothing will change until fines are increased to where they hurt!
1034336,PUMP KNOWS,2018-09-21 15:14:00,937,The first 4 are first time offenders?
1034340,DanD,2018-09-21 17:07:00,2223,First time caught maybe/likely. Dan.
1034350,David Chong,2018-09-21 20:57:00,836,The fines for these offences are far too lenient as far as I'm concerned! They need to be more substantial!
1034352,GBW,2018-09-21 21:54:00,8460,We all agree with you Chonger
1034401,Jeffrey L Evans,2018-09-24 05:50:00,7,Some people take fines as a ticket to attempt crime because they can afford it and the penalty is too less to make an impact on them. We need a better law.
1034405,Sinker,2018-09-24 14:25:00,8692,"Lets be real here. The problem is we have almost ZERO enforcement, so these guys just go around from lock to lock, and do whatever they want, whenever they want, and NOTHING ever happens.A CO could sit at Lock 19 in PTBO and write tickets all day long, or any lock for that matter. These poachers are everywhere there is public access, and they don't care about anything but themselves.  S."
