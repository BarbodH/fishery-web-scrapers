1034413,mitch seguin,2018-09-24 22:42:00,98,The Gan launch is not the greatest due to distance to parking.Â  I launch at the Grass Creek site (free) in Kingston and work my way downstream hitting a number of musky spots along the way to Forty Acre shoal. https://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/recreation/parks-trails/grass-creek-park

1034443,David Chong,2018-09-26 00:45:00,836,Grass Creek Park launch is usually good and rarely busy plus it's free! If the water levels are down sometimes it can be a little sketchy getting out!
