1034382,Rustic-Fisher,2018-09-23 21:20:00,826,"Little rant .... Im not a huge Facebook user but have “liked” and followed some fishing groups . Ive fished our rivers for over 25yrs ,  and have never seen so many hero Pics with fish that were caught (flossed) in 20” of water, I am actually leaning toward a full fall closure of these tribs . Am I just getting old and crusty LOL , or are you guys noticing the same ?  .  "
1034383,Fisherman,2018-09-23 21:56:00,7201,"Part of the internet phenomenon, where do I fish, how deep, is there ice yet and it goes on and on."
1034385,dave524,2018-09-23 21:58:00,4508,"It was just as bad maybe even worse before social media, idiots just are more visible today.  You be surprised how many salmon, especially males are accidentally flossed and the guy actually thinks it took the bait."
1034386,aplumma,2018-09-23 22:57:00,6896,this is going to have a very short life if it goes the way most flossing threads go. Keep it civil please. Art
1034387,Rustic-Fisher,2018-09-23 23:12:00,826,"Not sure where it took a turn , just asking if other experinced anglers feel the same. So far its pretty civil . Agree?  "
1034388,mitch seguin,2018-09-23 23:20:00,98,"Low water in the fall and bluebird skies has always brought out those with poor angling skills to 'catch' a salmon.  I'm not convinced there are more doing so than in the past (35 years).  It is unpleasant to watch.  As for the FB sites, I have also joined a few but dropped those where it was evident that flossing was mostly everyone's MO."
1034392,DRIFTER_016,2018-09-24 00:26:00,10439,I stopped fishing the fall salmon runs back in the early 90's. Got sick of the crowds and Bull. Spent my time chasing steel when it got too cold for the rubes.
1034393,grimsbylander,2018-09-24 01:17:00,3016,I hate flossing. Just last week the hygienist was giving me a hard time for not flossing enough.
1034398,porkpie,2018-09-24 02:50:00,2521,"There was a time this bothered me, now it doesn't bother me.  Large fish are accessible a few times a year to people that don't have boats.  Some bad things will happen.  Unless I hear of a run of coho, all of my fall salmon fishing happens in the boat in the 40-80fow range before they head upstream.  It doesn't interest me to chase a 20lb fish in 2 feet of water.  That said, I think back to all the fun I had salmon fishing as a kid, and into my teens and I wouldn't take that away from anyone.  ""Flossed"" or not, let them eat cake as far as I'm concerned.  I fell off my moral high horse when it comes to tributary fishing a long time ago.  As for the facebook sites, well people will be people."
1034407,chrisb,2018-09-24 17:03:00,24,"Never heard the termed ""flossed"" before. Someone please enlighten me."
1034410,Garnet,2018-09-24 18:21:00,2056,Was a that story hit the papers last year about 50 charges  on the ganny in 1 weekend The story did not emphasize that 550  where checked  and 500 where fishing legally just having a good time. Just because I  don't care to fish this area doesn't make it wrong and just because I don't care to eat these fish doesn't make it wrong. At this time  6000  salmon are over the Corbet. I  vote for access. I vote or family's to take kids to the river and have a good time. Later I will make them good anglers. 
1034411,Freshtrax,2018-09-24 19:11:00,2215,"I do more damage to the salmon population than anyone of of those guys.  Im with porkpie, our boat  and guests in years passed easily have kept 100+ bbq kings(5-10lber's) a year.  But i  dont like the straight up snagging with trebbles that goes on."
1034433,Rustic-Fisher,2018-09-25 21:43:00,826,"All good points ,  I will say one positive thing , I am noticing far less trash in Port Hope  , could be the town is all over it as there are a few movies being filmed in town, so that a plus for everyone .   "
1034439,BillM,2018-09-26 00:20:00,17367,I saw so many floaters down in PH a few weeks ago when I was down there..  Insane. That's what happens when you're fishing the soup.
1034489,chris.brock,2018-09-27 03:33:00,4053,"the fish don't actually bite, the line drifts into their mouth and the hook ends up in their face or mouth"
1034492,Garnet,2018-09-27 13:17:00,2056,I've also seen salmon come from 15--20 ft to smash plugs roe bags and skeen. So again  I support everybody that has a licence and is fishing legally. The others charge them ban them take there equipment.
