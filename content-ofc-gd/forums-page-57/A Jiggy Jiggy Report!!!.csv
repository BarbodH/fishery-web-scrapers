1034169,TJQ,2018-09-19 00:18:00,7806,"Well lately a rare opportunity presented itself for the kids and us to make it to camp as a family!! Couple of days fishing and a Tourney between Monique and Avery kept us in stitches (she won 6-5 fish today.. as predicted lol)  Camp is good although we went from sweating to death yesterday to a torrential rain and then 5 deg this morning, lol..   Here's some pics ...  This is always my happy place, and Misfish.. there's some equipment here you may recognize, still doing its hot water duty!!      (yes there's a star filter on this one... lol)         And we got a new hot tub!!!!"

1034171,TJQ,2018-09-19 00:30:00,7806,Little... still too many leaves on the trees..  but lol.. on the way up we had 7 birds...  wander across the highway in front of us just shy of camp.. lol.. we had to stop..   we went through and the idiots in the truck behind us pulled over and started chasing them down in the bush besides the road... always makes me wonder why people would risk a careless use of a firearm charge over a bird...  on the hwy... hey but what do i know...
1034172,Fisherman,2018-09-19 00:52:00,7201,"Nice pics, especially the night one."

1034184,Fisherman,2018-09-19 02:06:00,7201,"Lol, almost expect to see Capt Kirk chasing some Klingons across the sky."
1034188,Tybo,2018-09-19 05:03:00,1373,Avery has more hair on his face then you do on your back. Didn't know that was humanly possible.
1034209,TJQ,2018-09-19 16:25:00,7806,Its true we are a bit furry.....
1034210,misfish,2018-09-19 17:07:00,29133,"That BBQ is better used for venison and moose burgers. Big thick ones. LOL Nice to see it,s still going strong boss. "
1034223,kickingfrog,2018-09-19 20:04:00,8333,We got some up your way on Saturday. HOT and thick.
1034228,lew,2018-09-19 20:22:00,12766,Always enjoy the Jiggy Jiggy stories TJ and can't believe how much the kids have grown up in the last few years.
1034261,Moosebunk,2018-09-20 03:23:00,3970,"Those stars had me going a minute. Can't believe how much your daughter looks like Monique,  and how she and your boy have grown.  It's incredible that you're all together, enjoying it together. Must make you parents proud. It's a piece of heaven, your heaven, and so it's gotta be one helluva a great jiggy jiggy place to visit."
