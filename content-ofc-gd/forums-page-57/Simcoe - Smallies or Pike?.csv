Not looking for your Hot Spots - more of a general idea of what the fish are doing (of course if you want to share some areas, feel free to do so ?). This will be my 1st time fishing on it this year, so definitely out of practice."
1034663,jimmer,2018-10-03 17:58:00,2730,"Whatever is biting that day! However, you should target those monster smallies for some great memories if you get into them."
1034665,BillM,2018-10-03 18:21:00,17367,Smallies for sure.
1034672,grimsbylander,2018-10-03 20:20:00,3016,Is the smallie bite on fire in the fall as on Erie? When the water cools here to mid 50's they pack up and migrate...then eat anything that moves.
1034684,AKRISONER,2018-10-04 12:07:00,5558,"smallies...the bigguns are playing, seen a couple 6's caught this week by a board member and his buddy."
1034691,Dan668,2018-10-04 14:31:00,1120,"Smallies for sure. Not simcoe, but hit gbay a week and a half ago, and couldnt believe the amount of 4-6lbs we caught."
1034708,FishyFishy,2018-10-04 18:59:00,26,"I'm heading up next week to the bay, would be curious to know the depth/pattern that was working for you, if you don't mind sharing."
1034763,Dan668,2018-10-05 19:58:00,1120,"I was fishing mid lake humps with green weeds. Out in 20 ft deep, casting shallower. The big smallies came off dropshot, fish were hugging the bottom. Caught a nice largie and a few smaller but great size fish off a chatterbait rigged with a swimbait."
1034775,cisco,2018-10-06 00:55:00,597,Last wknd caught a 30 inch pike on a perch jig in 20ft. Empty stomach female. not much weed there and an offshore wind so water was colder and some minnow schools were going by. So might be a good idea to troll close to 20ft bottom for pike.
1034821,David Chong,2018-10-07 16:07:00,836,My understanding is that the Smallies are on the chew! Hope to get up there next week and check it out! There should still be some big girls shallow! That being said there are some giant pike out there as well!
1034826,misfish,2018-10-07 16:21:00,29133,"Yup, the crowd is starting David. I could not believe the size of the new 225 4 stroke on the back of the Kelsey sponsored boat. It,s the size of a fridge."
1034831,David Chong,2018-10-07 16:55:00,836,"Yeah, I figured that it would! As long as they're all letting the big girls go then it's all good! Be safe out there everyone!"
