1034606,maksuttt,2018-10-02 05:39:00,21,UA is best fishing channel on youtube
1033967,Jds63,2018-09-13 22:16:00,1365,"You gotta admit , Aaron is incredible.. weather you like him or not .... ????? "
1033969,TJQ,2018-09-13 22:40:00,7806,hahahahA... NICE!! 
1033970,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-09-13 22:43:00,48,That’s awesome! I thought it was a joke a first.
1033973,grimsbylander,2018-09-13 23:09:00,3016,I'm going to go out on a limb and say that wearing sunglasses with two different coloured lenses can make you do crazy things.  Good video. Musky aren't picky eaters when they decide to eat. lol
1033977,Jds63,2018-09-14 00:00:00,1365,Aaron’s videos are all awesome ... he always does an amazing job .... and he’s a little nutty ...
1033980,AKRISONER,2018-09-14 00:50:00,5558,Find me a hardcore fisherman that isnt  ill be the first to admit that the boys and I are totally effed lol his videos are the best on the Web IMO  i Fish with taro murata next weekend...should also be hilarious
1033981,Rizzo,2018-09-14 00:52:00,4754,that was awesome...hilarious too. Wish I had more hair.
1033993,chris.brock,2018-09-14 03:52:00,4053,"gotta love Aaron I'm in the same mind set, you don't need 900 baits of various sizes and colours, costing $20 each in your tackle box, here he catches two 40"" plus pike on a hunk of metal on a pressured lake  "
1033994,Moosebunk,2018-09-14 04:03:00,3970,"Just saw this tonight... Gotta admit, the dude is pretty much a fishing genius.  So entertaining. Ohhhh to fish in Manitoba and NW Ontario too... could call his shows ""Untouched Angling."""
1034021,craigdritchie,2018-09-14 19:16:00,1586,I love this guy. So many TV fishing shows have become nothing but repetitive crap ... it's so nice to see a guy do something different and entertaining. Loved it!
1034023,misfish,2018-09-14 21:09:00,29133,This guy had me hooked when he did that video song thing with the baits stuck in his face. Loony dude for sure.
1034024,muskymatt,2018-09-14 21:29:00,2608,Haha totally awesome!
1034025,Raycaster,2018-09-14 22:16:00,528,"The ""pulse"" technique on the figure 8 is actually pretty educational, don't know how many fish I lost due to them getting tired of a repetitive figure 8.  "
1034033,SirCranksalot,2018-09-15 10:07:00,3291,a nutty genius!!! 
1034038,buick14,2018-09-15 14:04:00,741,What a madman
1034040,buick14,2018-09-15 14:07:00,741,What a madman
1034065,BillM,2018-09-15 22:15:00,17367,"This guy actually made me laugh, I usually can't stand many fishing hosts to be honest.   He's a riot!"
1034097,mark demmery,2018-09-17 12:52:00,68,I second that!  He never gave up on her
1034099,Sinker,2018-09-17 14:53:00,8692,"Its true though. I must own 100 musky baits. This year I've used 2 of them. I put musky #50 in the boat last time I was out. Same with every species of fish. I own so much gear, and generally only use 2 or 3 of them and do just fine. I'd love to have a 3 lure derby sometime and see what comes of it. Aaron is certainly a great entertainer. Good fisherman too, and a great teacher. S."
1034131,Rattletrap2,2018-09-17 20:41:00,1652,"Great! Now I'm subscribed to......and probably addicted, to another You Tube fishing channel! lol"
1034132,David Chong,2018-09-17 21:29:00,836,Love Uncut Angling and the stuff that Aaron does! Very entertaining and informative!
1034139,Moosebunk,2018-09-17 22:48:00,3970,"Not 100 here... but probably 24 in the big boy box and another 50 in odds and ends muskie/pike/big laker crossovers. And you're totally right, been using about 7 or 8 consistently this season and don't change much because once you have those confidence lures, it's hard to switch out."
1034199,JoePa,2018-09-19 12:58:00,179,"Most of us don't realize how much money we have tied up in our fishing tackle - we keep buying a little over the years and it adds up - if someone were to steal our stuff and we had to replace it we would surprised at what it would cost to do that - then there is the boat and everything else we have - makes me think back to the 50s when I started fishing with a cork,  a hook and some live bait and a steel telescoping rod"
1034546,buckhorn250,2018-09-29 17:41:00,85,Aaron is always entertaining. I think its time for another 39 hours !!
1034585,AKRISONER,2018-10-01 13:41:00,5558,insider source...it is happening
