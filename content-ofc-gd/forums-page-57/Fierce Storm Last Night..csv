1034357,captpierre,2018-09-22 12:05:00,2521,Ugly wind and waves up here on Pigeon. Worst around 5 pm. Then settled only to get persistent strong wind most of the night.  Lots of wood floating by. Cold front 8 C this morning. Guys out fishing. Not me. ?
1034358,Fisherman,2018-09-22 12:25:00,7201,"We had that wind all afternoon, wore lead boots just to keep from flying away.  Took a quick drive around the neighbourhood and expected to see a bit of tree damage, but absolutely nothing, dead calm this morning."
1034360,OhioFisherman,2018-09-22 12:54:00,6623,"We went from the upper 80's to 60 in about 16 hours, no sign of the severe storms they were predicting here, but fall has arrived, I don't see any temps in the 15 day forecast higher than 74."
1034361,Fisherman,2018-09-22 13:21:00,7201,Looks like Ottawa and Gatineau area got wacked pretty hard.
1034362,lew,2018-09-22 13:36:00,12766,And the weather forecasters had it bang on as they posted a tornado warning for Ottawa.
1034380,JoePa,2018-09-23 19:04:00,179,I would take the wind - we are having so much rain that mold is forming on my enclosed patio and in my truck camper - it rains just about everyday - haven't seen the sun in weeks - can't get out to cut the grass too wet - just  hope we get some of the dry Canadian cold air to put a stop to this nonsense - maybe I shouldn't complain when I see what happened down in North and South Carolina - there was a video on Fox showing the fire department hoses off an interstate highway because there were thousands of dead fish on the road - when it flooded the fish ended up coming to places where they got stranded after the water when down again -
1034381,OhioFisherman,2018-09-23 19:45:00,6623,"I watched that video earlier today, and this video of it from a different source shows some bass I would have been happy to catch! https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/hurricane-florence-dead-fish-interstate-40-north-carolina-flooding-video-a8550956.html Besides the human tragedy of it? Can you imagine 3,400,000 dead chickens and 5,500 dead hogs?"
1034384,Fisherman,2018-09-23 21:58:00,7201,People can run but the animals are unfortunately left behind to suffer the tragedy.
1034394,grimsbylander,2018-09-24 01:23:00,3016,"They get it right when it really matters. Hopefully, the people that got warnings and didn't get hit won't mind too much."
1034400,Jeffrey L Evans,2018-09-24 05:41:00,7,Yes. the weather department has done a wonderful job. I hope everyone is safe in the country.
