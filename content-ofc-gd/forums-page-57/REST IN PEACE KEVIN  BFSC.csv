Happy  he was found, and sad at the same time. He did have a go pro on his chest, but the one from his boat is missing. I have a feeling the missing camera is a part of the puzzle. Kevins B rolls were a large part of what made his videos so great, but some were risky to get. S. "

You have to think about those left behind. I still have friends that refuse to wear a seatbelt, even after being fined. I just hope Kevins family can get closure, it's very important to get all the answers we can after a tragedy like this. Is an autopsy automatic in a drowning? I think yes but not 100% positive."

He was looking at fish pics on his cell phone and I interrupted saying "" nobody looks at fish pics without me knowing "" We instantly recognized each other and became ""instagram "" friends. A great guy. My condolences to his friends and family."

1033979,misfish,2018-09-14 00:39:00,29133,"The word friend is well used by many. Then there is the common names as, buddy,pal,dude,chum.  I have made, friends,pals,buddies,dude,s and chums, on these fishing boards. It was by pm, I first got to meet Kevin. Talking about fishing and what ever we fancy. With Kevin, it was his video films that intrigued me. I wanted to be a video posting guy too. We pm,ed back and forth, and what he was trying to tell me, sounded martian. After a couple of years, I made progress slowly. I do not make videos like him ( nor will I ever ), but he helped me to keep trying. Once I had the hang of what I thought was good, I just kept at what I knew. KISS LOL. He said to me one time, that is good. Good, ya ok. That works for me. Knowing that was a dude just saying it was good, but it,s crap from his standard of film making. I can except that. Im just a guy goofing around with video stuff that is new to me, and I knew he knew that, but was to much of a nice dude to say so. We never really talked about hooking up to fish, as I knew he had his clan of boys he fished with. Micky,Anthony.. I met Mikey first through this board,then Anthony later. I knew Kevin hung with this crew at times,so I knew I would eventually hook up with him. It was a raining morning on the river and these guys coming walking up stream. First Mikey,then Anthony. Out of the high grass comes this guy with the cameras. This had to be him. I give a shout out. Kevin? Yup. Brian. WOW, It was so cool to meet the guy behind the camera. He was a hoot to talk to. Never ever serious. Fun fishing talk. Since that day, we talked more and shared. The past couple of years, we seemed to have other buds, that knew each other. This is where the hooking up, became fun times. This was cool. One guy that we both respected was, Capt,Steve. Another guy that was a dude on the net,then a pal, and now another friend. This past ice fishing season, both my friends, hooked up more and more, and we had some great times out there. Kevin was a cool dude,pal and a a guy I will call a FRIEND. The saddest part of this  is, what we worked on and created,on becoming good friends, and I am sure it could of been greater, sadly, our hook ups will not be in the future. I know I am not the only one out there that feels a great lose. Kevin touched a lot of us with his smile and great nature. I know he has very close friends, much closer then I. Their lose is greater then mine. This is what he brought to me,and I am sure, those that knew him.  feel the same. I will leave this thread saying,  Thank you Kevin.  RIP MY FRIEND   "
1033986,Captain Steve,2018-09-14 01:33:00,2,"Well said Brian!  Gonna miss that guy, his videos, his very Kevin-ish sense of humor and the kid in a candy shop like excitement about talking and doing all things fishing.  Such a good guy he even called in sick to work one day so that he could come on an 800km round trip to pick up a new to me snowmobile when my arm was broken.  RIP  Kevin"

Kevin was a very special kinda guy, His smile and enthusiasm for fishing was contagious He was an electronics guru ,so helpful to me, when I was looking for info on the HDS8 and the Marcum LX7, I told him I was not the sharpest tool in the shed when it came to computers and electronics. Without hesitation,he took the time and sent me some very extensive very well explained emails in easy  to understand language. Just an amazing young man I sure hope Kevin (BFSC) and Mike (Tambo) are together catching monster Lakers, lots of Whitefish and walking some crystal clear rivers. RIP Kevin"

If some of Kevin's talent and wisdom was passed on to you, and it helped you to produce the videos that I have seen of yours, then his legacy lives on. I can only imagine the work that goes into editing these videos and I commend you on the great job you have done. Keep on making the videos of your adventures and a small piece of Kevin lives on."

Never knew him, but he sounds like a passionate outdoorsman. It's a terrible thing to die so young and terrible for the family."

He sounded like a top notch guy and I wish I could have known him. May your fond memories stay strong and help ease the sorrows you my be experiencing. Be safe everyone and live life to the fullest."
1033846,BillM,2018-09-12 02:55:00,17367,Weather was fine.   I was fishing out of Port Hope that afternoon/evening.  Water temps were 75-76 and the wind was SE maybe 5-10km/h.   Nothing that I would consider rough or bouncy.
1033847,Moosebunk,2018-09-12 03:21:00,3970,"I believe Kevin had plenty of friends here and elsewhere in the fishing community.  He was a talent behind the lens and a passionate angler.  This kind of thing just plain sucks!  Condolences to his friends and family, he will surely be missed."
1033851,discophish,2018-09-12 10:06:00,392,Such a tragedy and so very sad.  Highest condolences to Kevins life circle of family and friends and to all those who have lived through his amazing journeys on the water.  An endless loss to the fishing community.  May he rest in peace.  Huzz ... Such a peaceful claim to Kevins transition on his last night doing what he loved to do.  Amazing image of a dream we all share ... Kevins life ended way too soon.  I am lost for words
1033853,Acountdeleted,2018-09-12 12:31:00,2562,"The more I read and hear about this, there is a real possibility that what happened to Kevin had nothing to do with being on the water or in a boat.  It could have been a heart attack, annurism, stroke. It's uncommon at that age but these things do happen. For me, it would be the most logical explanation if they came back and said something had happened before he went into the water. My thoughts and condolences go out to the family. It is always a tragedy to lose someone so young, regardless of the circumstance."
1033854,Sterling,2018-09-12 12:42:00,477,My guess is he fell into the water and the boat got away due to the trolling motor.

1033861,lew,2018-09-12 15:05:00,12766,I've mentioned it here before but my Mom's brother was a bomber pilot during the war and him and his whole crew were all killed when their plane went down but the wreckage was never found so it was presumed they hit the ocean. Mom always said it was terrible they were all killed but the worst part was never knowing where they died or the fact they were never able to bury them and get closure. I thought of this when they couldn't find Kevin but now it'll be easier on all his loved ones. I also lost my son when he was only 37 so I know what they're all going through right now and it stinks.
1033862,JoePa,2018-09-12 16:18:00,179,Yes this is a sad thing what happened - we must always respect the water - here in Pa. thus far 14 people have died from boating accidents and the one common factor between them was the victims did  not wear their life jackets - I noticed in some of Kevin's videos he was not always wearing one - a tragedy like this makes me think again about wearing a jacket - something I must confess I don't always do - if the motor is running and you fall out of the boat without a jacket and your way out from shore your a goner
1033863,NAW,2018-09-12 16:18:00,4022,"I wonder if he had a big fish on, and was hanging over the side of the boat getting one of the notorious underwater shots he was so good at.

It is tragedies like Kevin loosing his life so young that I grieve for, when it comes to Ma and others that lived well into their 80's  I celebrate their lives and the legacies they left. I hear more often these days of  young men and women in their early 40's and younger dying from sudden heart failure , stroke and blood clots etc. Can it be the Gen X diets of fast food garbage they have had since old enough to play in the kiddy playroom at MacDonalds. When we were kids we got chips and Pop a few times a year and that's it. If you didn't eat what was on the table you went to bed hungry. Many of my nieces and nephews and friends kids ate anything they wanted anytime they wanted it."

Age is a factor but sometimes it's genetics. Had a friend young woman (under 30), full of life, suffer a debilitating stroke. She's no longer who she was and is mostly non responsive. as well, the point of wearing a pfd, is that if there is a health issue, it will keep you on the surface at least and thusly, easier to rescue/ recover.  also I do hope they can confirm the identity so that the grieving process can begin for the family. such a tragic loss of life...

African American children are 3.1 times more likely to drown. There are some interesting studies on the subject. Probably has to do with cultural upbringing etc and doesn't apply to Kevin.

1033663,misfish,2018-09-09 16:00:00,29133,Afternoon Chris There were 2 missing the pass week. A student and Kevin. Close to the same area. I have been refreshing all news reports all weekend. Thanks for the update.
1033665,Spiel,2018-09-09 16:47:00,9065,"As have I Brian, terribly sad. I've just heard that it's not Kevin. Who knows? 	But whether it's him or not I'm certain that any chance of finding him alive as long since past."
1033667,misfish,2018-09-09 17:03:00,29133,",The recovery of Kevin,s body, is what we all want now."
1033668,Sinker,2018-09-09 17:07:00,8692,I heard the swimmer was a local from that area who frequently swims there. The cobourg body was a missing elderly woman. Such a sad weekend. I hope the family gets some closure soon. S.  
1033669,Victor,2018-09-09 17:10:00,1609,"The two bodies recovered from Lake O yesterday (Saturday Sept 8th) were confirmed not to be Kevin. Please help the search efforts if you are able and spread the word to keep an eye out if you are in the area. Kevin and I share many close friends and I lived through his videos in the last few years after moving away from Ontario. It is devastating to have lost such a passionate and well-liked angler in our community. Come home Kev, we are all waiting for you."
1033679,KelfuN,2018-09-10 00:28:00,246,"Kevin is a close friend of mine, including a bunch of the members on this board. After hearing the news, my heart sank. A bunch of us have been walking the shorelines, if you want to help please join the FB group mentioned above. The more people involved, the earlier we find him. Come home Kevin."

1033728,AKRISONER,2018-09-10 17:19:00,5558,dont know kevin but this is still hitting close to home. Im praying for some kind of resolution to this all for the sake of his family and friends.  yet another very harsh reminder to us all to be safe out there.

1033742,mike rousseau,2018-09-10 22:02:00,4661,I know I’m not around much anymore but I follow Kevin on YouTube as his personality and passion for the sport are addictive to watch  very sad news
1033744,mike rousseau,2018-09-10 22:05:00,4661,In all seriousness I hope they pulled the footage of his many go pro cameras he was likely running at the time to see what he was wearing including PFD
1033749,BillM,2018-09-10 22:21:00,17367,"If he had a PFD he'd probably be alive.   The water was 75 degrees with a SE wind that day (I was fishing out of PH), even if you can't swim you'd be able to float around for hours without having to worry about hypothermia at all. BTW, nice to see ya Mike"

Saw two choppers come screaming into Hamilton from over the lake last night, and back out again probably 15 minutes later. Figure it was a fuel stop. One all lit up, one without any visible lights. I wonder if they were part of the search effort to the west end of the lake. "
