What a great morning to be out for a few hours. North breeze. Nice 1.5 ft rollers.PERFECT IMO. LOL Had the craziest hook up this morning. Dropping the bait like norm then all of a sudden it,s starts to peel off. Fish picked it up on the drop. That was cool. Bait was out of the cone, so didnt see the fish. "

1033580,smitty55,2018-09-07 00:49:00,928,For sure it is recommended to let the pellicle form on the fillets before going into the smoker. Help keep the meat together. I use a brine and find that it's usually between two and three hours before it gets that shiny sticky coat on it. My big chief smoker has seem plenty of fish over the years and I always leave the skin on my fillets which also helps keep things together. Plus my dog loves it lol.
1033595,DanD,2018-09-07 14:01:00,2223,"Learned some stuff reading this thread; thanks everyone. A few things I've learned on my own. Soaking the wood chips is a good idea for large cuts of meat; brisket, ham, pork belly (beacon) ect. Chips last longer but the amount of smoke seems to be less and slower to produce. That's fine for these large pieces of meats; they have more time to absorb the smoke before the surface seals. For fish I use dry wood chips; more intense smoke and less heat required. Keeping the heat as low as I can and still generate as much smoke as I can; gives more time for smoke to be taken into the flesh. Once the pellicle has absorbed the smoke that it can; there's no need to keep adding chips. If you continue to add more chips, you're taking the chance of building up some creosote on the meat. After 1 or so hours of smoke, I go by internal meat temp of 145 degrees. A word of warning here. LOL On two separate occasions, I've added alcohol to my wood chips and or the moisture tray. The first time was Drambuie to the wood chips. Man did it smell good; even after it blew and put a 1 inch buckle in the smoker's door on either side of the latch. The second was when I added some crappy but very strong Scotch to the water tray. That one rattled the patio door on the deck; when it blew. I'm on my third smoker now. LOL If you like the flavour of whatever kind of booze in your smoker; just give it a quick boil on the stove before adding it to the smoker. The flavour will still be there; but there's no potential  BOOM!!!!!  LOL Oh Yeah. One last rule of thumb for me. If what you're smoking lived on the land, use a wet brine. If it was a water dweller, dry all the way. Dan."
1033661,ch312,2018-09-09 15:34:00,1590,"Smoked fish or meat needs drying time in order to form a proper pellicle which lets the smoke stick to the meat better and results in a much more appealing product. Brined fish/meat should be rinsed with clean water and patted dry before the pellicle stage Smoke should always be that thin blue smoke and the smoker needs to be properly vented to let that smoke escape ASAP. You alter the flavor by using different kinds of wood and amount of time the smoker is producing smoke, not by creating more or less smoke. The amount of smoke coming from the smoker should be the same regardless of what you're smoking.  DanD, you're mistaken about creosote being formed if you add more chips. Creosote is formed when the smoker isn't vented properly and the smoke is allowed to linger inside the smoker and/or you're past the ""thin blue smoke"" stage and you're creating white/gray smoke. Many newbs think more smoke is better or it's better to hold the smoke inside the smoker when both are actually very bad ideas.   Misfish, the reason your two batches of fish look so different is the dry rubbed fish dried quicker and formed a good pellicle before going in the smoker where as the brined fish contained much more moisture and 30 minutes was nowhere near enough time to form a pellicle. Good pellicle results in that lovely smoker fish color where as your first batch is the result of no pellicle. My first couple batches of smoked fish wasn't even edible. It's definitely a learning curve."
1033664,misfish,2018-09-09 16:33:00,29133,"I think from now on,I,ll be going dry, but will try wet brine to see if I can get it mastered,if that is even possible in the smoking game. I would really like to find one that works and stick with it. Tweak it now then.  Thanks for all the comments guys  "
1034370,akaShag,2018-09-22 23:58:00,2073,"Guess I missed this earlier...... I have been smoking salmon and trout for a very long time, well over thirty years, and 90% of that has been in a (WET) brine. What a coincidence!  My Luhr-Jensen Big Chief smoker RECOMMENDS  a wet brine for salmon and trout.  As I said on another thread, I always leave the fish fillets on the skin, but yes I remove the dark parts or so-called ""blood line"" before serving the smoked fish. For sure it is a learning experience. Doug"
1033419,misfish,2018-09-02 19:45:00,29133,"Still new to the smoking thang, but enjoying. My frst atemp sucked. I for got to wash off the fish. This time, I followed the rules. First part of the smoke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Fresh LAKER  Next is in the brine of ,salt and lots of brown sugar and a gallon of water for 20 hours. No pic. Remove,pat dry and let stand for 1/2 hour.  Set up the racks  Note: Hanging without skin attached, no work. DANG. They fell, BUT lucky me, they landed on the lower rack. Adjusted them so they all layed flat  Brushed with a mix of maple syrup,mustard and black pepper.  Cracked more pepper after that.  HAPPY HAPPY Next, salmon, when I get one.  Note: I prefer the back strap of the fish. Seems to smoke and solid up the best. Then again, I am  new to this."

1033422,TJQ,2018-09-02 20:00:00,7806,That looks great!!
1033423,tender52,2018-09-02 20:22:00,270,"Good job Bryan. I have a off set smoker for a good 10+ yrs now. And I still struggle with getting the smaller pieces correct.  From my experience do it in 2 steps. If you can get a rack of ( back strap ) or the likes of thicker pieces, do them first. Then do the thinner tail prices on a colder smoke.  I may have to steal that mustard rub on you. But I also smoke mine with sugar maple. Try a sugar maple plank with salmon.  The wife and kids love it."
1033424,grimsbylander,2018-09-02 20:37:00,3016,"Did you soak the chips Brian? When I smoke on my Napoleon I usually soak the chips for half an hour. It's not a real smoker though, just a gas bbq with a smoker box. I use water with a healthy dose of Jack Daniels and for ribs, the flavour is fantastic."
1033425,misfish,2018-09-02 20:56:00,29133,"No, I do not soak the chips. From what I read and seen, soaking seems to prolong the smoking process. When you watch the real smokers, they are throwing in chunks of dried wood.. They are not soaking them logs. LOL I go straight dry. The smoking starts real quick. Like I said, learning, but from what I have read and seen, straight out of the bag, in to the pan, to smoker.  I do find the smaller chips seem to smoke slow for some reason. The larger chunks I used last weekend, fueled up and smoked so nice. Filled the condo with that camp fire smell. LOL"
1033426,misfish,2018-09-02 20:58:00,29133,"Did sugar maple last weekend . Did some nice sausages. I found the smoke great, but need to limit the amount. Very powerfull."

1033442,Pikeslayer,2018-09-03 00:30:00,1443," If that's the result you brought to Home Lake earlier, I give it ??. I'd rate it higher, but I only have two thumbs Confession: I stashed a healthy portion and it is vacuum sealed in my freezer for a winter treat ^^^^ This. You gotta trim those nasty blood lines/spread out B. Smoked, fried or baked, in any fish leaves a nasty taste"
1033449,glen,2018-09-03 03:58:00,2641,I trim that out too.  Fisherman. I’ve tried cutting the gills to let them bleed out.  I find lakers can be harder to prepare and cook then walleye
1033450,spincast,2018-09-03 11:55:00,3279,"yup, I remove the blood line too. Only the pink stays That's the one Sy - glad you kept some - I brought if for the sharing!. I need to get out on the lake and get a couple more before the season is over."
1033455,misfish,2018-09-03 15:01:00,29133,"Thanks for all the comments guys.  I will agree I missed that blood line, but I just pick it off when I am eating it. To add, the blood line will be there if you leave the skin on. Bleeding out does not get rid of it. Bleeding out keeps the meat from blood getting into. I bleed all my white fish as you know. The blood line is always there. So after this laker, I think I will do a dry mix next time. Knowing lakers are oily, I only added more moisture to the fish with the wet brine instead extracting the moisture and oils. One thing for sure, the apple wood was the ticket. Not over powering. Was just perfect. I went 2/3 this morning. Kept a small one. 8lb. I put the fillets in a bag of water and froze it. I have read this helps to make the fish much firmer when it thaws and makes a better smoked fish. Now I have to go and see if my light show video turned out. It was amazing. I was not on the water while it was going on. I may be loony, but Im not stupid. LOL"
1033466,dave524,2018-09-03 18:58:00,4508,"I enjoyed the 2 to 5 pounders we used to get in Haliburton, smoked , baked, BBQ'd even battered and fried,  the ones from Lake O and I suspect Simcoe  tend to be greasers because of the oily baitfish like Alewives and Smelt and smoking the best option. I suspect some of the Haliburton Lakers were insectivorous."
1033469,misfish,2018-09-03 19:44:00,29133,"I'm not sure it,s smelt, as their numbers have declined over the years. Still see the odd schools during ice season down the hole, but the herring would make more since, but even with the great come back since the closing of the season for them 12+ years ago, they seem to have disappeared again. There is talk they are chomping down on perch now. Yes perch.  Schools of them have been reported to be in the depths of 100ft now. We have caught them in 80 fow, and I have snagged a few in the 100 depth. This lake seems to change every year. Shiners seem to be in a abundance these years. They are seen in schools on the surface through out the year. I hope to have the right brine mix and  smoke right ,when it,s steel head time.  This is my goal."

1033565,Canuck,2018-09-06 10:35:00,491,I have found its best when you let the filets dry for a long time before they go in the smoker.  Someone said 24 hrs.  That works if the fridge is not too moist.  It needs a nice glaze on it before you smoke it.
