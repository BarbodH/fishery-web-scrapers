1034737,AKRISONER,2018-10-05 13:40:00,5558,"my best bud throw a diawa DX series swimbait rod, he loves it and its cheap! Ive used it and it feels pretty solid especially for the price, ive also seen him handle some pretty big pike on it with 0 issue."
1034753,OhioFisherman,2018-10-05 16:47:00,6623,"https://www.tackledirect.com/daiwa-dxsb-swimbait-casting-rods.html There is the rod Akri is talking about, the price seems good and they would probably be good any time you are throwing a heavier lure. Might be a bit much for a 3-4 inch Keitech on a 1/4 ounce swim bait head?"
1034760,KawarthaAngler,2018-10-05 18:30:00,273,"Keeping specific brand choices out of it ... I'd say any 7""2 or a little longer medium heavy, fast action would do a great job."
1034761,AKRISONER,2018-10-05 18:56:00,5558,"I realize that i mis-read the OP's post. If he is looking for a rod to throw smaller swimbaits on lighter swimbait heads i.e. 1/2oz then a good all around rod would be something like a spinnerbait specific rod that has a light tip, a bit of flex but plenty of backbone for big hooksets at distance. longer rod is great for casting distance, while also providing you more space for hooksets when youve bombed a cast out deep."
1034782,singingdog,2018-10-06 11:35:00,1047,"No special rod needed for smaller swimbaits on weighted hooks or jigheads. As stated, a good spinnerbait rod will do the trick. "
1034828,David Chong,2018-10-07 16:31:00,836,"Great points, I throw that size of swimbaits with a Daiwa TAEL741MHRB, it's 7'4"" so lots of length to get nice long casts, medium heavy power and regular action. Great spinnerbait rod but works well for swimbaits also!"
