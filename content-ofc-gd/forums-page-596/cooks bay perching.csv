532914,Woodsman,2010-12-30 15:56:00,1286,"I was out there yesterday in 31 fow. Solid action all day but the great majority were what I began to refer to as Simcoe 7's.  Must have caught over 200 of them with no keepers. They weren't too picky on what they hit. My best bait with the highest hooking percentage was a small Northland forage minnow tipped with small mealworms. A small orange & yellow rapala ice jig tipped with a Atlas red egg on the treble also was good. Also caught a 16"" herring on the rapala ice jig which quickly was released.  Rick"
