532958,ChrisK,2010-12-30 18:24:00,2772,Thats a great painting Bushart. I like that style a lot. Reminds me of when I was a kid fishing my favorite stream behind the house
532960,mercman,2010-12-30 18:28:00,7054,"You have an excellent gift Bushart. I always look forward to your posts.I can almost feel drawn into this one. I wonder if he wants company  Thanks for sharing, and Happy New Year !!!  "

532979,ChrisK,2010-12-30 19:39:00,2772,My bridge was a train trestle
532987,splashhopper,2010-12-30 20:56:00,2931,"My bridge was a bottle.  When I look at your art, I see what I missed all those years"
532988,bushart,2010-12-30 21:06:00,2628,without getting into a huge art discussion---My work tends to evoke various levels of emotion along the way.  I once had a woman break into tears at a show I was doing with one of my paintings---more recently was contacted by a woman in France who the same work had the same affect.  That's about all I can ask for--ok enough with the serious stuff---Is it true that I may be the best angler here on OFC
