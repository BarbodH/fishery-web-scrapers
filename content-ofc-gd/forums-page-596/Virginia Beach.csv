I started my trek out and was greeted by this sunrise.    The bite was slow and light just like a week ago. Managed about 30 perch, kept 12 and also got a 32 inch pike.    Also caught some bug.  Heavy congestion both in the chest and sinuses.  Sinus headaches, hot and cold, aches all over and irritated skin.  The ice was at least 8 inches think every where I drilled and I guess thats enough for some people and their  cars.    All in all it was a good to get out.   Cheers,  Tony."

532522,Cudz,2010-12-29 03:14:00,2652,I would not worry so much about the value of the car I would worry about the environmental fine that could be levied should the car go through.
