526436,JohnF,2010-12-08 13:56:00,3494, Does Stihl still offer that utility version power head? The one that will drive the cutter wheel and I think there were other optional attachments available. The pro woodcutters in our area seemed to like that unit back in my service days ('70-'73). As I remember it might have been a little heavy for a convenience saw but it was a durable bugger that was easy to service fast. We usually had plenty of parts for alomost any repair on hand.  I'm impressed that 40 years later Stihl is still leading the way. Not many products can say the same. Even Ariens blowers aren't quite what they once were although I understand they're still pretty good. It was a shame the way the quality of products like Lawnboy went in the crapper once the big box stores got them to sell.  JF
526441,irishfield,2010-12-08 14:22:00,26272,Hey Lunker.. while we're on chainsaws... have you seen or used the power sharp http://www.powersharp.com/default.asp blades and sharpening units.. or heard any reviews??? Sure looks like the cats meow vs the old glove and file while sitting on a log!!
526445,msp,2010-12-08 14:40:00,1336,Solo Small moters in King City. On King rd. just west of yonge st. great prices and service. they may even throw in a few extras.
526456,Flappn,2010-12-08 15:07:00,245,"Good Find Irishfield, just checked out the website and the sharpening product looks awesome. Just reached out to a local reseller to find out how much they are. This will make life a lot easier."
526458,irishfield,2010-12-08 15:12:00,26272,"They advertise at about $80 in the USA for bar, chain and sharpening unit. I can sharpen a saw to as good as new.. I just hate the down time and doing so when I'd rather be making progress on the wood pile.."
526468,Flappn,2010-12-08 16:09:00,245,Ya I don't have much patience so anything that gets the job done quicker works for me.

527137,cityfisher,2010-12-10 16:24:00,959,"borrowing a friends stihl 250 18"" blade for the weekend. now i need to watch some basic chainsaws vids on youtube  anyone recommend where to buy a pair of chaps in the GTA? I like my legs intact:)"
527139,stubbex1,2010-12-10 16:35:00,164," Maybe the stag shop?   i think tsc carries them, i bought mine from the local john deere dealer last year, try them as well"
527259,dada2727,2010-12-10 22:03:00,108,"Can't go wrong with the stihl ms260.  18"" bar is good, wouldn't go to much bigger though, you sacrifice a lot of power when you do.  You can take down a pretty big tree (32"" diameter anyways!) and it's still light enough you can use it in the tree.  I use it when I'm climbing all the time!  U definetly need some safety equipment though, I run a saw for a living and would never run one without saw pants or chaps might be more practical for you. Also some eye protection, hearing protection, steel toe boots, leather gloves and a hard hat wouldn't even hurt when your felling trees, you never know when a chico is gonna come flying out of another tree and visit you!  Some other stuff that you need would be a bar wrench to adjust chain tension,l etc., some round files ( 3/16 I think) to sharpen your teeth, and a flat file to drop your guides as your teeth wear down and to take any burrs off your bar.  Takes a bit of a knack to sharpen a chainsaw properly, but you'll get on to it.  If you plan on having the saw for a long time, the stihl ms260 is easily the best all round saw out there!"
527262,Cast-Away,2010-12-10 22:20:00,790,CF when you are ready to buy a Stihl the Chainsaw clinic a Weston Rd and the 401 is a great place to go.
527486,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-11 20:07:00,0,i like huskies.  as long as you buy quality you're good.
532385,cityfisher,2010-12-28 19:13:00,959,"little update.  I was suprised by the wife with a MS290 with an 18 bar for xmas!! This things huge lol. Maybe overkill for my needs but it was a present so i cant refuse it  I need to get a chain for it, should i go with a Stihl chain or can i get one from homedepot? Bar oil/2 stroke oil? stihl or whatever homedepot brand?  im looking into a pair of chaps, homedepot only has some ghetoo looking echo chaps..anywhere else that sells them?"
532386,irishfield,2010-12-28 19:25:00,26272,"Stihl saw.. go into the dealer and get the Stihl oil to mix 50 to 1. I've always been one to say oil is oil... but I can tell you for fact that my Stihl will not run properly using Huscavarna's oil  ..and if you need to buy a chain anyhow.. I'd look into that powersharp I noted above. Either way, you always want a spare chain ready to go. Be nothing worse than breaking one and not having one you can throw on quick and keep working the few hours you have on a weekend."
532390,vance,2010-12-28 19:42:00,719,I always used Stihl oil for my Stihl weed wacker as it already has stabilizer added in.I am on my 3rd spark plug in 11 years and I only change them because I feel quilty about not doing it more often.  vance
532961,cityfisher,2010-12-30 18:29:00,959, No luck with the Power Sharp System for my MS290... Gonna give it a go this weekend.                    
525814,cityfisher,2010-12-06 14:02:00,959,"Hi all,  I recently purchased some land in the utterson/muskoka area(not water front but nearby), its got an old driveway on it that needs to be leveled,graveled, etc and id like to put in an opening about 60x60 . Short term, somewhere to camp on the weekend, longterm build a small house on it.  Im looking to buy my first chainsaw, any recommendations? I want something decent, not going to tackle the huge trees but all the smaller ones.  I have a couple local contractors come by to give me estimates on the job as a whole. They have told me that this is the best time to do the clearing, leveling, grading, etc."
525819,John,2010-12-06 14:09:00,2956,"Stihl all the way. Wouldn't go any smaller than 18""."
525822,skeeter,2010-12-06 14:17:00,1907,what john said----  the choice of contractors whether its a grass trimmer or chain saw.
525837,bigbuck,2010-12-06 15:00:00,2449,"Either a Stihl or a Husqvarna. They are both great chainsaws, go with either an 18"" or a 20"". Get plenty of quotes and see if you can get someone to come from out of the immediate area to quote as well. Good luck!!"
525839,cityfisher,2010-12-06 15:03:00,959, Will do!! thanks for the tips guys.  Any recommendations where the best place to buy a stihl or Husqvarna?
525840,Lunker777,2010-12-06 15:04:00,866,"Stihl !!!!!!!!! ( im kind of bias since i sell them ) hahah  depending on what your looking for.... more commercial model ( lighter, stronger, more $$$$ but will last longer ) or more of a residential model ( they weight a little more, they are less $ )  I work at a JD dealer and i sell a mix of each.  I would suggest a ""MS260"" with a 20"" bar. Its a commercial grade saw that I feel would be best suited for what you are doing. Moving to a wooded area, you will probably be cutting wood for a good portion of the year! Its light so you wont get tired if you have to use it for any length of time. The bar is a good size, not to big, not to small ( like you asked ) you will be able to take down any small trees/trim any good size branches ! At the moment, they have the "" wood pro"" promotion on, which includes a carrying case($50) and an extra chain($30).... Everything included for $579.95 !  If you have any questions.... shoot me a PM !"
525848,tb4me,2010-12-06 15:34:00,3295,Stihl here too! Wouldnt settle for less
525853,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-06 15:40:00,10439,  Yep!!! That's what I run.  The Husky's are also a very good choice.
525855,irishfield,2010-12-06 15:47:00,26272,Stihl ! Remember to leave the stumps about 4 feet high.. so you can just put the backhoe bucket on them and use that 4 feet as a lever to pop them out!
525871,Sinker,2010-12-06 16:22:00,8692,"  I use this same saw almost daily to clear and maintain trails. I've taken down some HUGE trees with it as well. Never had a problem. Keep it sharp though, nothing worse than a dull saw, and nothing more dangerous!!!!!  S."
525873,Fisherman,2010-12-06 16:26:00,7201,"If you can, get them to throw in the chaps and the helmet with screen face and hearing protectors..safety first, you might leave tree stumps... but don't make your legs stumps either."
525881,cityfisher,2010-12-06 16:43:00,959,"good advice guys, all this talk about Limbing body parts has got me thinking to let others with experience do all the major tree work."
525885,misfish,2010-12-06 16:48:00,29133,"  Good call.  Pop ownes 2 Stihl, the 18 and 20 inch which I bought for him 2 christmas,s ago. I also got the rest of the safety gear for him. He always wears it."
525886,blaque,2010-12-06 16:54:00,2419, Smart thinking if you ask me..........nothing more dangerous than using a tool that your not confident with.  Ill be the first to admit that im not comfortable wielding one! lol
525887,misfish,2010-12-06 16:55:00,29133,Ask around the area about guys that will come in and cut in exchange for the wood.
525888,Sinker,2010-12-06 16:56:00,8692," This is a REAL good idea if you don't know what your doing!!!! Chainsaws bite once, and its game over!! If you are available on weekdays, get in touch, I'm pretty handy with a saw, and I'll give you a REALLY good deal!  S."
525938,smally21,2010-12-06 19:38:00,993,"if i could only own one saw (imagine only 1 saw!)_ it would be a stihl 260 with 18"" bar. big enough for felling and bucking, small enough for limbing. easy to find dealers and parts.  get the 250 if you dont want to part with the extra dough. i spend most of my cutting time on a jonsered 2145 but there is a stihl dealer in every town youk now?"
525954,Flappn,2010-12-06 20:32:00,245,"We have both a 18"" Husqvarna and 20"" Stihl both excellent machines. The Husqvarna starts quicker that's about the only difference I can see."
525968,Lunker777,2010-12-06 21:19:00,866," Great advice! But I dont think you will find a dealer that will ""throw in"" almost $200 worth of stuff !  The chaps I would be getting first, simply because they are made for saw, the material will actually bind in the chain stopping it if it comes in contact ! We saw it on a training video (they didnt use a real human for the demo though!!)"
525969,misfish,2010-12-06 21:22:00,29133," CRS did for me,but probly cause I buy from them alot."
525970,LeXXington,2010-12-06 21:24:00,1928,Get the biggest you can afford first time out. Have fun
525975,Lunker777,2010-12-06 21:45:00,866," Were you just buying a saw at the time, or did you have a bigger bill ?  I know for a fact Im not making $200 profit on a saw ! hahah"
525978,misfish,2010-12-06 21:48:00,29133,"  I said, I buy alot there, over the past 10 yrs.I give them alot of our companys bussiness."
525989,misfish,2010-12-06 22:28:00,29133,
526113,Harrison,2010-12-07 12:24:00,2202,"Good for you Cityfisher!  Buy once, buy right.  Do not buy an Echo. I had nothing but issues with mine.  I am pretty sure they came up with name after hearing all the curse words through the bush.  I have a Stihl now, very happy with it. Little tough to get started sometimes, but she's good to go when she does.  Also, I respect what others are saying about safety 100 percent. Read up on proper use of the saw and take your tim e. You'll get the hang of it."
