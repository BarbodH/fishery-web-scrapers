532570,fishyfingers,2010-12-29 16:09:00,46,"was out on Dog Lake, the ice was about 6 to 8 inches thick mostly clear. Was a nice day even though I got skunked. The most frustrating thing was there was another guy set up about 40 feet from me who was contantly takin pike off his tip up, and a few bass as well. My brother in law got one smaller bass and that was it for us. I went over to see what this guy was doing that we maybe were missing, but he was pretty much doing the same as us.. I guess he just had the honey hole  Any way was a really nice day out there, just a bit frustrating to see the fish being caught right next to you while you get skunked   but thats why they call it fishing right..  I would post a pic but we got nothing haha"
