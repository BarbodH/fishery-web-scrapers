533189,mike rousseau,2010-12-31 08:57:00,4661,I'm having issues with my ice shack skis... 4x4 s were too blunt and didn't have enough clearance... Today I put 2x10 s on now my shack looks like a sky-scraper...and it will be hard to drill holes when my plywood is 1 1/2 feet off the ice.  What do you guys think is  the right height???
