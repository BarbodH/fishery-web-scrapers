We did alright on the first trip on Monday. We fished from 4-7ft of water in a small lake off of Lake Ontario. On Monday my little brother caught his first perch through the ice and also the first fish of our season, made him real happy. The perch we caught on the first trip were a good size from 8""-11"" long. Here is a pic from Monday    So, today we got out also for some more ice fishing, same place as last time, we fished from 11am-4pm and came up with 1 small....really small pike and another half dozen semi jumbo perch. The little guy came up empty and Dad caught the pike(his first ever). I caught a few nice perch...the perch were from 9""-12"" long, this time tho we stuck it out in 10-11.6 ft of water.  All in all I had a good time out with the family, a little frustrating but next time I'm sure well get some real fish  Thanks for reading and here are the two photo's from today.      Happy New Year"

533009,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-30 22:30:00,3761," I asked Dad and Doug what they thought, also had my Uncle out today for his first trip, I'm sure they were a little scared but I know I was last season on my first outing. It measured at 10"" at our furthest rod from shore."

533253,Rod Caster,2010-12-31 15:48:00,5784,Skate fishing is my favorite...I'm hoping this rain creates some good solid rinks in the north like you have in your photos.  9-11inch is pretty good perch...well done!
