532974,irishfield,2010-12-30 19:28:00,26272,  .. and click on that page where it says walleye.. and the next page says.. lol
533025,Billy Bob,2010-12-30 23:18:00,5865," Sinclair buddy....when you get old and start smelling like a fish even though you haven't caught a fish in a week or two you will realize that what Dad, uncle Bob or Gramps taught you was the local HERITAGE of that fish...and that's a good thing...if they said it's a pickerel, then be proud of that name because it give you identity of where you are from....that should always be important.  Someday you may or your grandson may say, I caught a limit of pickerel, even though he/she was fishing somewhere in the USA and another angler with a Canadian background over hears that statement and a bond will be formed......to me that's a great thing...we are losing way too many heritages as it is now...don't push that process...PLEASE.  Bob"
533047,jediangler,2010-12-31 01:07:00,1923,It's called evolution Billy Bob and nobody's gonna stop it from happening.
533052,Whitespinnerbait,2010-12-31 01:16:00,2038,  Finally !!!!!!    Some common sense
533098,Cudz,2010-12-31 02:09:00,2652,Well I guess someone elses grandad named it a walleye as well so what makes that the proper name? The proper name is its latin species name.
533177,walleyemaster,2010-12-31 04:51:00,325,"I like to call them walleye, yes its the eye in the wall that i like. and if you like the wall in the eye then you have your answer either way. plus look at its eye theres no eye in pickeral and no wall in pickeral so it has to be called walleye.. should stop drinking about now im actually making sense to myself... no fish were hurt during this photo shoot all fish were let go to be free..   WALLEYE   "
532766,skinny,2010-12-30 00:35:00,442,ok I get told these are the same and I get told they are different walleye and pickeral  someone please clear this up for me
532771,limeyangler,2010-12-30 00:40:00,5204," They are and they aren't  'pickerel' is another name for 'walleye' in some parts.  Pickeral is also a type of pike......'Chain Pickeral'   Google chain pickeral to see one, they are smaller than northern pike with  distinct 'chain' like markings.   So....like i said, they are the same and different depending on who you speak to and where you speak to them. I also find that people who are a little longer in the tooth refer to walleye as pickerel more often than the younger anglers out there."
532772,skeeter,2010-12-30 00:40:00,1907,"potatoe/ patatoe tomato/tamato  canadians say pickeral, americans say walleye. i say mmmmmmmmmmmmm gooood"
532774,Billy Bob,2010-12-30 00:44:00,5865,"Pickerel, Walleye and Yellow Pike are the same fish (meal)..Blue Pike are extinct but a cousin of the Yellow Pike ..now chain pickerel is different as already explained here....but what about galvanized pike..."
532780,irishfield,2010-12-30 01:05:00,26272,Man.. is it this time of year again??? lol  When they are small and nice eating size.. they are PICKERAL !  When they get a little bigger they are Pickeraleyes  When they are 14lbs in the Bay of Quinte.. they are Walleye..
532781,Terry,2010-12-30 01:08:00,14456, true dat  I start calling them walleye at 8lbs  and south of scugog walleye north of scugog pickeral
532801,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-30 02:09:00,1622,Walleye always have been always will be Richard
532811,walleyejack,2010-12-30 02:44:00,358,"Here Walleye Walleye Walleye,dinner time ...."
532814,Leecher,2010-12-30 02:48:00,7832,walleye or pickeral?  That's too confusing..... we call them doré up here
532830,Joey,2010-12-30 03:25:00,9122,"My daddy taught me how to fish for pickerel, so they are pickerel cause dad's are always right, right?"
532867,Billy Bob,2010-12-30 12:42:00,5865," Joey, you got that one RIGHT....Remember the show ""Father Knows Best""  HAPPY NEW YEAR...wait, do you guys celebrate New Years in Canada...  Bob"
532881,Rod Caster,2010-12-30 13:49:00,5784,"  Yup. We call it ""Canadian New year""."
532904,Governator,2010-12-30 15:15:00,879,"Unless someone specifically says Chain Pickerel, then it's safe to assume they are referring to walleye when they say just pickerel."
532935,Cudz,2010-12-30 17:16:00,2652,"They are the same fish.  They are actually even pronounced the same the only differce is the spelling.  Pickeral is pronounced ˈpɪk ər əl, or ˈpɪk rəl and Walleye is also pronounced ˈpɪk ər əl, or ˈpɪk rəl.  (unless you are American)"
532936,irishfield,2010-12-30 17:17:00,26272, 
532938,jediangler,2010-12-30 17:27:00,1923,"Put 7 of them on a stringer and go into your local MNR office. The word pickerel won't appear anywhere on the ticket they will give you. You will be charged for keeping over your limit of walleye. It's not an American/Canadian thing it's a ""my gramps incorrectly called them pickerel so I incorrectly call them pickerel too"" kinda thing."
532941,Billy Bob,2010-12-30 17:30:00,5865," That's right......if American from the west coast you first say ""Dude""...from the south it's ""Cousin""...   and from the Buffalo area, it's (_________) fill in the blank..."
532942,irishfield,2010-12-30 17:33:00,26272,"Find some old reg books.. they'll be called pickeral/pickerel, as they still are in current Ontario Parks documents. Pull up a Provincial Park like Finlayson in Temagami and see what species of fish the lake has to offer.. http://www.ontarioparks.com/english/finl-multiple.html"
532948,Roy,2010-12-30 17:55:00,13728,"Let's all call them ""zander"" and be done with it. Personally, I prefer the word ""pickerel"" but I call them ""walleye"" for the board.. Or let's all go to the Latin names for fish."
532949,jediangler,2010-12-30 18:12:00,1923,Thanks Irishfield. I looked on your link and found this page for cool water species. Pickerel doesn't appear on the list but walleye and sauger do.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/248438.html
532950,Cudz,2010-12-30 18:14:00,2652,"I think Jacques has is right.  Dore (don't kow how to write an e accent aigu)  Forget that.  Too much work to insert the e accent aigu.  Lets just call them ""Food"" or ""Dinner""  Had a nice day out there.  Caught me 3 nice dinners and and a couple of bass."
532951,Roy,2010-12-30 18:15:00,13728, What? No saugeyes?
532957,Cudz,2010-12-30 18:23:00,2652,"Oh yeah, I almost forgot about pikeperch  I think I will call them that from now on.  PIKEPERCH!!"
532959,Old Man,2010-12-30 18:27:00,822,"This is the problem with common names and is the reason why the only true and correct way of identification of any species is through the use of Linnaean Taxonomy which uses latin (a dead language) to classifiy all species. So walleye/pickrel/zander etc. the only true name is Sander vitreus. But what ever the locals want to call them, they are delicious.  Kingdom:Animalia Phylum:Chordata Class:Actinopterygii Order:Perciformes Family:Percidae Genus:Sander Species:S. vitreus"
