532434,irishfield,2010-12-28 22:58:00,26272,"Well Don... I had two employees that during our company golf tournament, a decade or so ago, took off in the cart from the Brooklea to the Beer Store on Hwy 93. Russ Howard sold them the beer.. then called the police when he saw what they were leaving in. Pulled over on their way back.. impaired operation of a vehicle.. no registration.. no insurance.. theft of cart. Wasn't pretty..."
