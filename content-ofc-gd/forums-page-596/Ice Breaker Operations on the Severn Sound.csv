531948,irishfield,2010-12-26 01:49:00,26272,JDS's post on the ship coming thru the ice fishermen reminded me I had this notice.. ICEBREAKING_Midland.pdf
531963,NAW,2010-12-26 03:53:00,4022,Good to know Wayne.  Thanks!  Much ice up that way yet?
531964,irishfield,2010-12-26 03:55:00,26272,Everything is frozen over in the sound.. but I don't know how thick it is as no time to get out there. Sleds are running around on it.. but around here that means absolutely NOTHING !
532017,Tdel,2010-12-26 16:42:00,393," Last week on Wednesday or Thursday there were a couple of people fishing about 75ft - 100ft from the dock. A friend of mine told me he was on the ice to talk to one of them. He said there was about 5 inches of ice.  He also said an OPP officer went on the ice at that time to talk to the fishermen and check the ice thickness too.  I wasn't there for the conversations but I was down there to see the fishermen on the ice and the snowmobiles running the bay, they were staying close to land and so were the fishermen. Still too early for me to go out there and get on the ice. I can wait until the breaker goes by and the ice refreezes. I don't like swimming in cold water.  Tom."
532051,Cosmos,2010-12-26 20:48:00,588,I was fishing Midland Bay yesterday. Ice condition is perfect. I would say around 8'. Thank for sharing information.
532055,skeeter,2010-12-26 21:14:00,1907,"holy crap, since last thursday until today the ice went from 5"" to 8'"
532398,irishfield,2010-12-28 20:34:00,26272,"Possibly Overcast is a Penetang Harbour 5"" (full of springs) and 8"" is Midland. Regardless... both safe for walking and saw a few hitting Midland Harbour when I drove by at 6am yesterday.  Update on ice breaking operations.. start in the morning.. -UPDATE- Ice Breaker In Midland Bay Commencing Ice Breaking Activity Dec 29,2010.doc"
532762,kickingfrog,2010-12-30 00:27:00,8333,Tonight's news showed a snowmobile racing along side the icebreaker and crossing in front of it. I don't know how dangerous it was (I wouldn't do it) but the video was pretty dramatic.  Many (most?) of the non-snowmobiling public sees us all as the same.
532770,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-30 00:38:00,0,  Must have had the ships itinerary.
532784,Rizzo,2010-12-30 01:24:00,4754,what's the thrill in buzzing around in front of the ice breaker??? Bunch of clowns on tv. I imagine it would be far more of a thrill to go BEHIND the ice breaker
532807,Carp,2010-12-30 02:29:00,1488, Now that I'd like to see !!!  
532870,jedimaster,2010-12-30 13:14:00,3472,  you mean like this one?  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wM-K63hGgo
532873,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-30 13:26:00,1622,There is just an age requirement to operate one nothing says you have to be Smart? Richard
532876,Roy,2010-12-30 13:31:00,13728,It would scare to crap out of me to see any of my boys doing that. I don't think they would though...they seem to all have inherited my chickenpoop gene.
532983,myot,2010-12-30 20:11:00,131, That Video was done by friends of mine that have been building watercross sleds for years. It may seem crazy to someone that has never riden a sled with that capability but I've riden thes sleds and the only limits are rough water and gas But to eachs own  Dan
532993,Gerry,2010-12-30 21:50:00,257,"Myot, where was the video shot? I'm curious because some of the scenes look like areas in the West Am of L. Nipissing or in the French River."
532997,myot,2010-12-30 21:57:00,131,its in a couple of differnt locs but most of it is just north of Honey Harbour  Dan
533012,kickingfrog,2010-12-30 22:52:00,8333," I do that too. Canadian shield, pines and H2O. It all looks familiar. Easy to get lost too."
533114,nofish4me,2010-12-31 02:34:00,404,"here's site I came across years ago, full of info for what's where & when on the big lakes.  http://www.boatnerd.com/  I can understand how a snowmobile crosses water, but this is different.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TRCroy3DKs&feature=related"
533149,misfish,2010-12-31 03:36:00,29133,"Guess ya all havent heard of ""EXTREAM"" Part crazy and nerves.. The guy that was wizzing on his sled (He really wasnt WIZZING),was no where in danger.Semi 'EXTREAM"" LIVE YER LIFE AS YOU LIKE.Just dont take others.  "
