Suitable for taking a stroll and having a wee look see. Bite has been soft and real slow. Not aggressive at all. Even so still managed to catch myself a breakfast for me and the pooches.  I think the weekend weather might put a stop to things for a few days."
532561,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-29 15:32:00,2582,Bruce...you got out and got some fresh air and a few fish...AND got to torture use with some fish fry porn. Sounds like good times to me   I can't wait to get down your way for my yearly winter smelt expedition. But with this mild weather coming I know it won't be anytime soon.
532954,Leecher,2010-12-30 18:19:00,7832,Glad you got out Bruce    and able to get yourself a nice little lunch even with the slow bite  Yeah that weather coming is going to make a mess of the good ice we have so far   I took a day of rest today since my daughter wanted to sleep in and I'm good with that  Thanks for sharing Jacques

532973,Rod Caster,2010-12-30 19:24:00,5784,Do I understand this correctly...fish come fileted and pre-breaded in Toronto? A time saver to say the least!!
