Basically, I want wilderness and the best fishing I have ever imagined...mainly walleye.  I am considering Eddie North's camp, but am looking for suggestions.  Spending the money to go would be a stretch for me, so I want to make it totally worth it.  I am not looking for frills...just awesome fishing.  Thanks."
