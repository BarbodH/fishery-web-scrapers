Has anyone else tried them or have any first hand(foot) knowledge, thanks.  http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?i=421987&pdesc=Edge_Expedite_Toe_Sters_Elite_Foot_Warmer"

532366,kickingfrog,2010-12-28 17:05:00,8333,I haven't tried any of these battery powered boots but I think Mark's workwarehouse has a version of powered boot heaters as well. Might be worth a look.
532456,bigugli,2010-12-28 23:58:00,6138,Nothing new about the product. From the 50's to the present they were called electric heated hunt socks. They do not compensate for poor quality boots and are only as useful as the battery pack. The older models ran on 9V
532474,CRAPPIE,2010-12-29 00:54:00,213,I have the and too big so i want to sell it for $15.
532477,Fisherman,2010-12-29 01:16:00,7201,"Okay, so they are the same or similar to the old Electra socks and Gloves. Crappie..you got a PM"
532478,Fisherman,2010-12-29 01:20:00,7201,"Ya, I tried a pair once, they didn't have the sticky tape, one ended up on top of my foot the other was choking and tried to crawl outa my boot."
532486,gaspumper,2010-12-29 01:30:00,393,"The boots from Mark""s are $300.00 they have a built in rechargeable battery pack supposedly good for 1000 full charges.There are 3 settings high (65)med(55) and low (45)."
532543,Hawg Hunter,2010-12-29 11:48:00,204,"i myself would not buy anything to do with heating your feet all it does is cause moisture in the boot makeing your foot freeze later,good pair of 2000 gram thinsulate boots will take care of cold feet. just my 7 cents lol"
532547,Fisherman,2010-12-29 13:08:00,7201,"Oh, no mistake, I understand the quality boot part, I have a pair of Sorels with a spare brand new pair of liners, It's just some days it feels like the internal furnace isn't putting out the BTU's to the tootsies."
532549,Roy,2010-12-29 13:46:00,13728,"I'm a proponent of quality socks and boots as opposed to heated boots. A warm hat will also feed a degree or two more to your feet. (NO, the hat on your head, not on your feet!)"
532670,Fisherman,2010-12-29 21:22:00,7201,"ST, maudit, I figgered I'd have to buy a size 44 toque to do that,"
