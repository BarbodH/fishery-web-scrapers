Both my wife and I are from there, and our parents both live on Lake Kenogami which is right on Hwy. 11 N. I got out a few days to play with my new Lowrance HDS5 ice system and man is it sweet. In 2 days of fishing we ended up with 2 walleye, 12 little pike, and 3 perch. Here is the picture of the only ones that count. They were YUMMY.For got my camera at the house so no fishing pics.  "

533161,skeeter,2010-12-31 04:00:00,1907,i cant afford all that expensive equipment like an  Lowrance HDS5 ice system. so i resort to the old ways of the rednecks.....
