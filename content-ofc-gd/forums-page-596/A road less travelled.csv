That fog was wicked this morning on the drive up. Fish started hitting a minute or 2 after punching holes, and we had 4 hours of furious action. Admittedly the were mostly dinks, but there were enough quality perch showing up.  Around 11:30-12 someone flipped the switch, and the bite turned off. For the next three hours we kept moving and working new holes to coax a couple of bites here and there.  By the end of the day some spots were definitely getting soft and sloppy. Next couple of days will make things dicey."

533219,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-31 13:47:00,2582,Good job Bruce I wish you had went to the spot I told you about. It's been a slaughter there. I'll be out there again Sunday. I just hope the front doesn't shut them down or move them.  Hope you enjoyed your Brekkie this morning.
533220,Rod Caster,2010-12-31 13:53:00,5784,Nice perches. Very good colors on them.
533221,bigugli,2010-12-31 14:00:00,6138,"We couldn't see a thing for the first few hours, so we were guessing on location. We were on the outside fringe beyond the pack though."
533270,s2k4mee,2010-12-31 16:53:00,73,I see you've been using perch eyes as bait

533290,BillM,2010-12-31 17:39:00,17367,"Same thing happened to us on Cooch the other day.. Furious action then around 11am or so it shut right off.  Lucky for us we had a pail full by the time that happened, so we just packed up and left.  Biggest fish of the day was just under 14inches."
