531758,GoneFishin,2010-12-25 03:24:00,349,"Hey guys. I got out today with a buddy to do some Christmas eve ice fishing. Haven't done to good in the past  outings but today was pretty steady. We started off with a nice large mouth bass on a buckshot spoon. Then next we got a huge bowfin! (first for me) hit like a perch then ran like a pike :S  The rest of the day we spent running back and forth to are rods that were bouncing around and getting nailed by some big perch. Got 2 that were 14"" and some 12""ers   I also spent some time playing with my hds5. Flashers have absolutely nothing on these units. The marks on the screen are my buckshot spoon tipped with a minnow. I can't wait to try it out in deeper water. "
531761,Familyfisherman,2010-12-25 03:33:00,188,Nice work...Where were you fishing?
531762,Cudz,2010-12-25 03:34:00,2652,That is petty slick.  The hds has a flasher mode?
531765,GoneFishin,2010-12-25 03:42:00,349,"Yep, comes standard. You have to see it to really appreciate all of the features. And I was fishing in a bay off lake Ontario."
531866,Cudz,2010-12-25 17:07:00,2652,Do you have a pic of how youhave it rigged for ice fishing?   Do you have a seperate transducer?
531871,EC1,2010-12-25 17:39:00,930,Nice Fish!
531957,Nipfisher,2010-12-26 02:53:00,2449,"GoneFishing, I just bought the PPP-161 ice fishing pack for my HDS5 and I got a chance to play with it in the hut yesterday afternoon. I was in 12' and the HDS was picking up my 1/4 oz. jig tipped with a 1"" gulp shiner. It was cool to see it wiggle on the bottom. Only problem I have is when I use my flasher it gives me a 3rd panel? I have played with all the settings and still can't get rid of the 3rd panel."
531966,Sinker,2010-12-26 04:30:00,8692,"I find the lcd screen is way better than the flasher mode anyways.  I always have. I can't seem to get used to any kind of flasher. I like my graph. As long as  you know how to set it up, they work just as good, and sometime better...........not always though!!  S."
531986,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-26 12:37:00,3761,"Nice job buddy, those bowfin fight like hell through the ice i remember.  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
532005,Big Cliff,2010-12-26 15:16:00,6899,Where did you buy your PPP-161 ice fishing pack? I am interested in getting one for my HDS5
532006,Nipfisher,2010-12-26 15:25:00,2449,"  Big Cliff, I ordered mine from Radioworld on line. They processed my order and shipped it out the same day. I had it in less than 24 hrs. Don't forget to order a second gimbal bracket if yours is still on your boat. The PPP-161 does not come with a bracket."
532024,Big Cliff,2010-12-26 17:18:00,6899," Thanks, I now have a new toy on the way LOL. I have flashers and cameras but my hds5 has all the charts and everything so it should be super for ice fishing plus I marked a bunch of spots this summer that I thought might be good for hard water."
532025,limeyangler,2010-12-26 17:29:00,5204,"Great catches, nice set up with the HDS5"
532373,Rod Caster,2010-12-28 17:20:00,5784,Nice Bowfin. I don't think we get those up North
532535,GoneFishin,2010-12-29 05:00:00,349," I am using the transducer that came with it. I have it set up on a portable titelock transducer mount, but I'm going to bolt it to a piece of dowel and float it in my hole."
532537,GoneFishin,2010-12-29 05:08:00,349,"I wish I had the extra money right now for a kit but I'm going to have to piece it together. Right now it's hooked up to a car battery... I'm not sure how to fix your problem but, if your reset your settings it should go away. I can't wait to try it out on simcoe for lakers and whities."
532544,scugpg,2010-12-29 11:52:00,1373," Although the kit is pretty sweet, its easy to build something up that will work. You can source the ice transducer for around $60 and a small battery w/charger for $40 or so. Heck you can use the transom transducer if you have to."
532852,GoneFishin,2010-12-30 05:00:00,349," Yah, I just got my girlfriend to buy me an early birthday present and picked up a little energizer battery. I also just wired my fish tv because it didn't come with a power auxiliary cable.. Can't wait to use them both but I am starting to think should of went with the size 16 instead of 12.. I'll have another report up soon, got a couple pike and perch today and I'm hoping to get out tomorrow."
532975,Leecher,2010-12-30 19:28:00,7832,Nicely done GoneFishin Never caught a bowfin before but looks like a riot to fight congrats on your first Thanks for sharing Leechman
