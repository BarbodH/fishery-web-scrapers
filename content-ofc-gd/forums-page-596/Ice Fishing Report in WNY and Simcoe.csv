532636,Sandbag,2010-12-29 19:10:00,533,"Billy Bob...  I was on Cook's Bay Dec. 17th.  The ice was about 4 1/2 inches of good ice with an inch of white ice on top.  Started in 10 ft of water and was mostly dink perch.  Moved out to 16 ft of water and got into some nice Jumbo Perch.  I walked out of Port Bolster yesterday.  The ice is kinda rough near the shore but smooths out away from shore a ways.  I walked out to 16 ft of water which is right where the ice gets rough again, i fished along this rough ice.  The bite was slow yesterday and lots of small perch.  Did get a few whoppers (13inch), however they were few and far between yesterday.  Casey's in Port Bolster has lots of minnows and you sure get a very healthy scoop for $5.  Hope this helps  Cheers  Craig"
