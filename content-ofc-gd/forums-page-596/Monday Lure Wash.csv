532259,irishfield,2010-12-28 00:47:00,26272,"Picked up Terry in Orillia, shortly after 7am.. and headed for the lake over yonder to meet up with Lloyd/Keith/Drew and Dale. Was great to be able to get out and grab some fresh air and the resultant head clearing. Keith got a few nice fish.. including a 3 lb pickeral, while Lloyd nabbed an OOS 5 lb laker and a nice big pickeral. Terry and I just washed our lures.. but was a great shake down for me to make sure all the equipment was ready for the season.  mini raviloi for a late breakfast..    6"" of ice... up from less than 2 last week!    Getting the water ready for Mr. Noodles lunch.    I don't believe in small baits and finnesse !!! LOL  "
532260,Joey,2010-12-28 00:49:00,9122,"Excellent that you got out Wayne.  Sorry we missed it, but next time, we'll arrive in style  Well at least you ate well  Joey"
532264,Handlebarz,2010-12-28 01:21:00,3790,LOL I never thought of a fuzzy through the ice.  Nice to see some getting out on the hard water. All my ice plans so far have fallen through I hope to get out before the new year.
532273,Rizzo,2010-12-28 01:49:00,4754,"that is my kind of ice fishing! When in my boat I go hardcore...no time to eat. But on the ice I'm just like you...crack out some food, share a few laughs etc. for me ice fishing is more of an ""experience"" than summer fishing."
532286,Terry,2010-12-28 02:48:00,14456,"It was good to get out fishing with you Lloyd and the boys  I didn't take any pictures and I didn't catch any fish  but I did use the underwater camera  I saw 2 walleye and barely got them recorded and ad have some video to show how my camera can be set to auto rotate which makes it easy to find my jigs I cut 3 holes one for the camera and one for each jig, I could see on the monitor better then the recorder recorded it but I will figure it out sooner or later   <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9pMQePMxco?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9pMQePMxco?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9pMQePMxco?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>"
532296,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-28 03:27:00,0,Stupid cameras. Same goes with flashers the first time you use one. You see a fish come in and you STOP doing what you were doing to bring the fish in. The fish comes in and takes a look at a bait that's not moving and continues on.  Nice to be able to see them though..
532299,danc,2010-12-28 03:51:00,4677, I have to agree. I've never used any kind of electronics ever while ice fishing. And I've never ever been skunked. Sometimes technology goes too far imho.
532318,corvette1,2010-12-28 13:06:00,1765,awesome video terry it's going look cool when you hook one on video
532319,Terry,2010-12-28 13:07:00,14456,I am so busy watching them I forget to set the hook
532321,skeeter,2010-12-28 13:15:00,1907," Well thats to bad DanC i feel for you. But being the nice guy i am, i will let you come out fishing with me and we will break that trend !  Guaranteed, i have references. GBW, yonge_one,Canadian Copper,Tracker,speckchaser."
532341,NAW,2010-12-28 14:27:00,4022,Did ya get to test out those new rod holders ya made a few weeks back?
532355,irishfield,2010-12-28 15:49:00,26272,Yes I did Nick... and if I can get a video down and up loaded you can see how nice they work. With the howling wind we had yesterday it even allowed the rod to become an automatic jigger!!!
532364,fishhunter,2010-12-28 16:56:00,604,That was nice to see everyone out Yesterday. Its to bad the fish were not active. That wind was crazy!! At one point I thought I would be sitting in my hut moving 100km the way it was blowing me when I went to the other side of the lake. Terry that video is cool. I have fished that lake 12 years now and never seen the bottom. The two eyes you seen were nice too. I think they seen the sign that I put under your hut that says (MY NAME IS TERRY)so they swam away )lol
532368,splashhopper,2010-12-28 17:06:00,2931,  Now I could see me doing that too  Maybe I won't try the electronics after all ... or maybe I will....
532370,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-28 17:10:00,2690,"Good that you got out, Wayne!!  Gotta love that Mini Ravioli, breakfast of champions, lol!  That video, Terry posted is hypnotic."
532372,kickingfrog,2010-12-28 17:19:00,8333,Would have hated to see your artistic masterpiece ruined by you hooking an actual fish.  Thanks for takin' the time.

532401,fishnsled,2010-12-28 20:47:00,3520,Great to see you got out for a few hours Wayne. Tough to beat a few hours on the lake to clear the head.
532455,LeXXington,2010-12-28 23:55:00,1928,"Very cool vid Terry,  Glad to see you out there Wayne."
532531,NAW,2010-12-29 03:48:00,4022," There ya go eh    Nice subtle action jigging, no hands required.  Would work good on Simcoe, no shortage of wind there."
532980,Leecher,2010-12-30 19:41:00,7832,"Awesome Wayne    Glad you got out and get to enjoy a different scenery for a change Testing out the gear, having a late breakfast lunch and sharing the hard surface amongst friends.... PRICELESS Thanks for sharing Leechman"
532989,Twocoda,2010-12-30 21:10:00,4130,"""C and C"" catch and consume ""C and R"" catch and release ""W and W"" wait and watch  Nice ""W and W' report guys...
