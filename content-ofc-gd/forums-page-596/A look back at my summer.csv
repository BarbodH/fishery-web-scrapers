532510,mercman,2010-12-29 02:49:00,7054,"Started off in June, with my Bro selling me this.     It is my first boat and motor. I had done lots of fishing with my Dad, Grandfather and brother, but now i could fish whenever i had the urge.And i did a lot this past summer. First fish was a nice Pike.   Then the wife caught this drum.I can't get ger to touch fish yet,but i'm working on it   I was just happy catching fish, so the wife and i did the multi species thing,      Finished of the summer with my Brother on White Lake bass fishing in his Ranger.        I had a great time.Hopefully next year will be even better,now that i have a bit more experience behind me. Thanks to all the great tips and ideas i;ve picked up in here,i should be a better angler. Happy new Year to all of you OFNers Tite lines to you all."
