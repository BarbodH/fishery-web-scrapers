532345,craigdritchie,2010-12-28 15:16:00,1586,"I don't think anyone could argue that Bob is the goods. In 10 years of working with the guy I never once saw him as anything other than a complete and total class act who would often go out of his way to help others. Most people have no idea of how much time (and money) he gives up to help different charitable groups all over Canada - often anonymously. Bob, and Wayne, are two people I will always have nothing but complete and absolute respect for.  Most TV show hosts only take, take, take. It's all about how much money they can make and how much free sponsor crap they can stuff in their garage. How many other TV hosts give their own money back to help fish habitat projects for everyone's benefit? Bob and Wayne, through their Fishing Forever Foundation, have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years to fund all kinds of community fisheries improvement projects, and I can tell you that a good chunk of that cash came out of their own pockets. I hope the mods won't mind me mentioning that you can learn more (or make a donation yourself) at www.fishingforever.ca.  Bob Izumi is awesome. Stoty, I'm sure you had a great time with him and I hope you have the pleasure again. We should all be so lucky as to spend a day on the water with a guy with that kind of character, and who can catch big fish with that kind of consistency."
532349,Stoty,2010-12-28 15:22:00,2910,"Wow, I didn't know that he was that involved with various groups! That's amazing, and definitely a true representation of his character!"
532351,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-28 15:29:00,2690," If you ever get a chance to see the episode of Craig and Bob steelheading with gummi bears and assorted other baits, don't pass it up.  I nearly fell off the couch laughing during the part where Craig finally lands a bow in the spot where he never had before! On a more serious note, Bob and Wayne have always ""put back"" into the fishery.  One of the few that I've watched from day one. Good for you, Jamie!"
532359,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-28 16:28:00,3761,"Nice job, must of been lot's of fun. Not that guides aren't great but I wish he did more solo fishing trips out on the ice rather than all the loges and guide service trips.  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
532564,Flappn,2010-12-29 15:42:00,245,Bob's the best. Great Job guys!
532567,Bob Devine,2010-12-29 15:55:00,251," Mike as you know Bob is an accomplished angler and he could shoot a number of shows by himself, but thankfully as others have posted he gives back to many groups. That includes fishing guides, which in turn helps their business. I was fortunate to film with Bob for Lake Erie walleyes back in 2004 and in 2003 shot with Pete Bowman on the Detroit River for spring walleyes. Both are a lot of fun in the boat."
532569,Roy,2010-12-29 16:05:00,13728,"I know that some years ago, Bob was fishing with a friend here. The friend just happened to mention that it was his son's birthday. Bob insisted that he drive 40 miles (miles not KMs) out of his way, 80 miles both ways to visit with the boy who was 12ish at the time. Bob was the kid's idol. When Bob knocked at the door, the kid answered and when he saw the Zoomer his jaw dropped. Bob left him some stuff, wished him a happy birthday and left as suddenly as he had arrived. I always had respect for the dude....today I have more."
532571,fishyfingers,2010-12-29 16:20:00,46,"wow nice fish report! Sounds like you had an awesome day. I have never met Bob, but I like his show! Also, cheers to you G2 guys, I went out with Gary(Hodgey) over the summer on the BOQ, we had a great day and got some nice fish too, will do it again sometime for sure."
532577,jbailey,2010-12-29 16:40:00,866,wow congrats! next time tell him to bring his niece
532677,GBW,2010-12-29 21:43:00,8460,
532684,Steve,2010-12-29 21:56:00,2075," Well, there is one man, who is ""loved"" by so many on this board.  Mr Darryl Choronzey  Darryl and Bob have done more for the fishing industry than what the rest of the industry has done - combined."
532763,skeeter,2010-12-30 00:32:00,1907,"Bob is a class actfor sure. he is one of the few that i will watch on tv, along with dave mercer of course. "
532836,Stoty,2010-12-30 04:05:00,2910,"Good to hear fishyfingers! On a side note, Gary is no longer with G2 Angling."
532925,daryl0815,2010-12-30 16:43:00,225,"That sounds like an awesome day or 2 of fishing. I only met Bob once, at a sportsmans show, but he was super nice, and made time for everyone who wanted a word with him. I am a big fan of his show, he is one of the few fisherman on TV who dont try to make a 2 lb bass seem like a 6 lb bass! He seems like a really genuine guy, and from what the other members have posted here obviously this guy has made a good impression on most of the people that he has met!  I had no idea that he was so involved in the charity work though, usually if a TV fisherman is involved in charity work, they do nothing on their shows but pump themselves up because of it, definitely another credit to Bob's character that he doesnt go around flaunting and making himself out to be a hero, even if he really is!"
531630,Stoty,2010-12-24 20:24:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  Just thought I would share the amazing past few days I've had!  I had the honor to fish with and film and episode of ""Real Fishing"" with Bob Izumi!!  I have to say that he is a TOP NOTCH guy! A class act, all the way.  We had an amazing few days on the water, and landed a ton of fish, along with some MONSTERS!!! (Including my new PB Walleye of 12.3 lbs)  Instead of re-posting our blog, here is the link to it (along with a bunch of pictures).  http://g2angling.com/en/blogs/  Enjoy! *Stoty"

531682,Stoty,2010-12-24 21:53:00,2910,"Ya, it was an amazing experience!! I was starstruck the whole time! Lol"
531687,GBW,2010-12-24 22:13:00,8460,"I was getting his twitter updates and I will say, some nice fish!"

531695,Ron,2010-12-24 22:27:00,1683,"Now there is a guy worth braggin about! Bob and his brother are top notch guys!  Now you gotta get Aaron and Dave out to make a great hat trick.  Were you guys just filming today on open water?  Cheers, Ron...  *edit*  Just read your blog, I see you are referring to Ice fishing."

531830,Cudz,2010-12-25 14:46:00,2652,Way to go.  Now that is an early CHristmas gift for sure. So jealous.
531855,spoon,2010-12-25 16:13:00,74,"I had the pleasure of fishing with Bob, he is one of the nicest and kindest fisherman  Congratulations on your day Scotty"
531863,lhousesoccer,2010-12-25 16:53:00,442,"I've filmed a number of times with Bob bass fishing on Lake Champlain in Vermont.  Actually, my icon pic to the left was taken by his producer a couple years ago.  I couldn't agree more G2 - Bob's the best there is on TV and in person. No fake attitude or ""tv personality"".  Bob in person is exactly how Bob looks and comes across on tv - he's hilarious, self-deprecating, honest, friendly and genuine in everything he says and does - he's just a real person who loves to fish and has been lucky enough and smart enough to turn it into a career from very humble beginnings.  Congrats on the opportunity, and I'm looking forward to seeing the show!"
531933,Stoty,2010-12-25 22:48:00,2910,He sure is! I'm looking forward to fishing with him again in the future (hopefully)!
532085,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-27 00:27:00,203,"Wow, what an amazing oppurtunity!!!!    I have always loved watching Bob Izumi & wow, great experience!!! Definitely lucky    I would love to be able to go fishing with Bob"
532290,Rattletrap2,2010-12-28 03:04:00,1652,Now you are talking! I met Bob back in '83 at the Sportsman Show in Toronto. He was just about to start his first show on television. He was at the Red Fisher booth. Bob Izumi is a true Canadian fishing legend. Way to go!
