532796,ccmtcanada,2010-12-30 01:49:00,7971,"I got a message from Fishnsled a while ago about the possibility of some ice fishing on Lake Simcoe over the holidays...and as luck had it, schedules and the weather aligned and cooperated!  Today, Fishnsled, Headhunter, HH's friend and I ventured out to Cooks Bay in search of some perch.  We headed out on foot at sunrise, and walked out a little bit.  HH was eager to try out his new auger and he fired it up and it cut through the ice like butter!  AFter a few minutes, we were fishing...and HH starts catching almost immediately.  The action was non-stop it seemed all morning...and the final tally was over 450 fish!  Mostly dinks, but got a few for the frying pan.  No matter what HH tells you, we all caught about the same number of fish  It was a perfect day...we packed up at 1pm and hit the road.  Not bad for a few hours out on the ice.  The winds were light, the temperature was mild...couldn't have asked for a better day!  Here are some pics...  HH with a monster...   Fishnsled...   HH's Buddy...   My fish was bigger than Fishnsled!!!   This was my haul for the day...   And a little while later, they looked like this...the kids kept picking at the plate before it was time to eat...   Thank you gentlemen...hope to hit the ice with you guys again soon!"
532806,Terry,2010-12-30 02:22:00,14456,nice going real good day for fishing  if I felt safe driving my ski-doo over to there I would have paid a visit  but we need just a bit more ice
532831,Joey,2010-12-30 03:27:00,9122,"Nice report Cliff.  Nice mess of fish there, but what a motley crew you fished with  Joey"
532844,Bernie,2010-12-30 04:33:00,3190,Good stuff Cliff. Glad to see you guys keeping those fishing skills sharp.
532848,skeeter,2010-12-30 04:45:00,1907,"nice going guy's. and thanks cliff, now im hungry"
532849,GBW,2010-12-30 04:52:00,8460,I wish I was feeling better and able to join you guys.  Good on ya tho!
532850,Jet,2010-12-30 04:58:00,364,They're always worth the long effort of cleaning. Nice stuff man!
532851,fishnsled,2010-12-30 04:58:00,3520,"Great report Cliff, did you save me a piece of fish? lol!    I felt better that you didn't make the trip as well Terry. Ice was good (about 5 inches of clear) where we were but not sure what was in between us. Better to be safe then sorry. We'll try again soon.        Got to be ready for your place Bernie."
532877,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-30 13:36:00,1622,Great Report Thanx for Posting Richard
532879,Rod Caster,2010-12-30 13:45:00,5784,450 fish? I'll assume sunset to sunrise so 7-5pm. 10hrs or 600 minutes. 600 minutes for 450 fish equals nearly 1 fish every 1.3 minutes . You guys were BUSY!!
532892,ricoboxing,2010-12-30 14:21:00,398,yummy!!
532906,Terry,2010-12-30 15:30:00,14456, I would say 5 hours and 5 guys 450 / 5 = 90 90/5= 18 fish and hour..is that right  
532911,Headhunter,2010-12-30 15:52:00,5703,"Fished 7:00am to 1:00pm Here's how the count REALLY went! HH -159 - I did say in my post a couple of days ago, I was gonna put a hurt on some perch! FishnSled - 150 CCMT - 88 Rubin - 59 It was non stop action all day... I fished the first hole I dropped a line in for about 2 hours before I made the big move, about 10 feet to the next hole and I think I fished it for another two! The perch on Cook's are being very cooperative... and in many cases, they were on the bait before we could flip over our bail! Jiggin Raps, with Berkley power maggots were the ticket and having either a very sensitive rod or a cheater on your rod were also huge! I'm already itching to get out again... but the weather doesn't look too good for the next couple of days! Would have been nice to have you join us Terry, but always better ato be safe than sorry. Thanks for doing the report Cliff... nest time, I'm going to lap yah! LMAO! HH"
532912,fishnsled,2010-12-30 15:54:00,3520," Pretty damn close Terry but there were only 4 guys and we out for about 5.5 hours. So.... 450/5.5 hours = 81.82 (rounded up to 82) 82/4 guys = 20.5  The actual numbers if I remember correctly was HH - 160, Fishnsled 150, CCMT - 80, HH's buddy - 60. A couple of fish were snag so we didn't count them. The fishing was pretty much non-stop for the entire day. Heavy baits to get down fast and the hits would start immediately. Many fish were on as soon as you flipped the bail. They sure were turned on for some reason. Best day of perchin' in a long time. Great way to end 2010 fishing season."
532915,Headhunter,2010-12-30 15:57:00,5703,Ha ha... I beat yah Will!!!! HH

532927,LeXXington,2010-12-30 16:50:00,1928,"Nice going, Perch yummmmy"
532970,Leecher,2010-12-30 19:10:00,7832,450  Sounds like a perch marathon Your arms must be sore from all that perch hauling Can't get any better than that Thanks for sharing Cliff!!! Leechman
533046,bigugli,2010-12-31 01:06:00,6138,"It certainly was a furious dink bite today, and bite sensors tips were the thing for seeing a soft bite. Had a non stop bite for 4 hours."
533217,Spiel,2010-12-31 13:43:00,9065,"Nice outing guys, no doubt Joe had on one of his fancy/lucky shirts under that big orange suit.  "
533278,Headhunter,2010-12-31 17:14:00,5703,"Some things never change, eh Chris! LMAO HH"

533285,Headhunter,2010-12-31 17:28:00,5703,Forgot to mention in the O.P. that we caught four Herring on Wednesday as well... a first for me anyway... thought we had the mother of all Perch on until we saw the silver flashing under the ice... all we returned unharmed. HH
