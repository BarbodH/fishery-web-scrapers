Although the launch appeared to be going perfectly, the surprise disconnection of the giant balloon took the assembled crowd by surprise. There was an audible gasp as the clear plastic balloon rose into the sky after an hour of filling from a helium truck, but without Mr. Fournier's capsule beneath it.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/sto...y/National/home  WHAT A JOKE"

207135,love2fishhave2work,2008-05-27 18:40:00,212,they chose this site because there is no air traffic in that area.  would have been interesting to see him try but my sense is he may have had second thoughts and this was an easy way out.

207316,holdfast,2008-05-28 00:00:00,1813,"Apparently this guy has made over four attempts and failed.  This latest fiasco made CNN News.  It is felt that this guy has swindled the sponsers and never did intent to carry out the mission.  Others also think that he chickened out.  Sorry Roy if I called your cousin an Idiot. Thanks  love2fishhave2work for an answer that makes sense, because if you ask me, this Yardbird picked the wrong geograhical area to pull this attention seeking stunt, because this area is constantly windy."
