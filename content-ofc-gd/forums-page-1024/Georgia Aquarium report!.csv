207184,FinS,2008-05-27 20:20:00,463,nice pics
207187,JohnF,2008-05-27 20:43:00,3494,"Nice shots. We visited the Baltimore aquarium with the kids years ago and were blown away. It's easy to spend a day gawking at the fishies. It's pretty durned impressive, so if this one is bigger and better, it must be really really something.  Several of my (diving) friends work as volunteers at the Baltimore and Seattle aquaria. They get to dive in the tanks to feed the fishies and clean up the fish poop. They say it's the greatest job in the world.  JF"
207289,mepps,2008-05-27 23:08:00,1301," I'll see what I can do about gettign soem more photos edited, the videos looks great so far too!  These were photos taken with the Canon Rebel XTi DSLR   There are several different exhibits at the aquarium, including a freshwater one with bass, catfish and several other species, but the photos there didnt turn out so well since the lighting is bad."
207429,Joey,2008-05-28 02:13:00,9122,"Those are freakin awesome pics Clive, I'd love to go there.  The baby's looking great.  Joey"
207547,jediangler,2008-05-28 11:46:00,1923,"Great pics. I've been to the New England aquarium in Boston, which was the largest before Georgia's was finished. Looks like fun for the whole family."
207597,Moosebunk,2008-05-28 14:28:00,3970,Great shots Mepps.
207612,setomonkey,2008-05-28 15:01:00,872,"Love the pictures with your family, Clive.  I think our sons are about the same age. Looks like you are enjoying fatherhood as much as I have been...  Mike"
206725,mepps,2008-05-26 23:42:00,1301,"I just got back from 2 weeks in beautiful Augusta Georgia. I was there for training, but went fishing every chance I got, usually before work from 5-8am.  I saw tons of gar and managed to catch only one fish - my first striped bass, measuring about 22 inches. The best part was that I caught it on one of my own lures. Sadly, I didnt have my memory card in my camera, so now no one believes I caught one.  I'll be heading back in 2 weeks to give it another try. I mainly fished a huge man made lake called Thurmond Lake (formerly Clark Hill Lake)  Here a shot of a small alligator gar i found one day. Most of the ones swimming around were much larger.    Here a shot of the 200 foot high Strom Thumond Dam. (The Savanah river is below)    The highlight of the trip was heading into Atlanta to visit the world largest aquarium with my family. Its hard describe just how incredible it was. I could have easily spent all day there. Here are a few of my favorite photos (we took 723 in total!) If you are ever in Georgia, this is a MUST see. They even have whale sharks and beluga whales!                    If you want to see more, I have uploaded about 35 pictures here"
206727,danbo,2008-05-26 23:45:00,2646,Awesome!
206729,Tarzan's Jane,2008-05-26 23:48:00,1183,Awesome...love the pics!!!  The one of you and your baby looking into the aquarium should be framed.
206731,Greencoachdog,2008-05-26 23:52:00,8163,Great pics Clive!!!  I've got to get over there and see that!!!... I'll take some bait!
206734,mepps,2008-05-26 23:53:00,1301," For sure, I'm gonna print out a bunch tonight I think!"
206735,misfish,2008-05-26 23:56:00,29133,"Those pics, man are just ""FANTASTIC"". I looked at them before I even read the report. Very cool   Love the Balugas (sp?) Always been a fav of mine."
206736,mepps,2008-05-26 23:56:00,1301,"  Make sure you have some heavy equipment GCD, those groupers were 300+ pounds!   thanks Misfish!  I also have 30 minutes of video I havent looked at yet.  I cant wait to see it!"
206738,Zamboni,2008-05-26 23:58:00,235, There is No Fishing signs at the front gate....I laughed and asked the guard-he told me they have taken rods off a few people going in!   Excellent pics-that aquarium is amazing.
206752,tbayboy,2008-05-27 00:18:00,1497,Amazing pics Clive.  Sure sounds like a great place (I've been to Monterays and that took nearly the full day so I can imagine this one).  Congrats on the striped bass story - I'm sure eventually someone will believe you
206791,Dozer,2008-05-27 01:26:00,896,Awesome!  Those whale sharks are something!  They use bow and arrow for alligator gar!  Its really cool.
206798,BFSC Kevin,2008-05-27 01:41:00,1351,beautiful shots
206863,snag,2008-05-27 02:48:00,1932,Just amazing Clive!  Ashen must have loved it!  I thought I was going to get eaten by a grouper in Indonesia once. They get gigantic!
206872,MJL,2008-05-27 03:03:00,2427,I'm speechless...Simply amazing Clive
206894,ehg,2008-05-27 04:08:00,2666,That is an award winning photo! Thanks for sharing this awesome story and pics.
206901,highdrifter,2008-05-27 05:24:00,2534,"Incredible Clive... Just awe inspiring.  Those shots tell of a different story, one of a bond between family and the natural side, one that can only bring you closer to your loved ones.  The look of wonderment from Ashen is priceless.  Thanx for that.  peace HD"
206917,lew,2008-05-27 08:52:00,12767,"Thanks Clive, those pics are excellent, specially the one with you holding the baby in the air."
206931,mepps,2008-05-27 10:40:00,1301,"thanks fro all the kind comments guys!  I think Ash really enjoyed it, an I'm glad we have teh photos for him to look at when he grows up!"
206938,steve_paul,2008-05-27 11:02:00,658,"Great report and photos Clive, thanks.  Your little boy is really growing too, beautiful little guy."
206942,b2kptbo,2008-05-27 11:19:00,1505,"Very cool, thanks..."
206959,blaque,2008-05-27 12:18:00,2419,"What more can anyone add, just awesome. My brother lives in the area and its one of the things he keeps tellling me i have to come down and see.........and from the pics. He aint kiddin. Thanks for bringin me there, cuz i may never take the drive down to see it in person lol. (i dont fly) Some of those shots should be considered for their brochure. I would even contact them and send them to em. You definitely captured a moment with your baby for sure."
206991,muskymike,2008-05-27 13:26:00,772,"Clive, just amazing pictures. You should put together a slide show or something of more pictures. The 35 just wasnt enough. One thing I have noticed about all of your pictures, they all look professionally taken. Whatever camera you are using, keep it up. I have a buddy that lives in Atl. and fished Thurmond this year, they were using line counters for Stripers and brought in 12 on that day...on a boat mind you.  Good luck when you head back down there and take some more pictures, yours are always fantastic to look at."
207009,mikeh,2008-05-27 14:19:00,824,great pictures. How many tanks are there in there? I'm assuming they are in separate tanks/exhibits.
207014,fatherof3,2008-05-27 14:39:00,1769,"awesome pictures,thanks for sharing"
207060,BITEME,2008-05-27 16:14:00,1969,They are some of the most stunning pictures I have ever seen!!!!!!!!
