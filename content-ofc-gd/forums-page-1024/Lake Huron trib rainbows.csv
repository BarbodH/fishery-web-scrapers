Most rivers are full of rainbows in spring and more importantly, hardly a fisherman to be seen! My favorite creek holds rainbows in spring, hungry smallmouths in summer, giant Chinooks in the fall and more recently HUGE brown trout in fall as well.( ive caught them in excess of 10 lbs in early September) .My favorite creek is  too small to boat  even in spring but  the lack of fishermen more than makes up for that!"
