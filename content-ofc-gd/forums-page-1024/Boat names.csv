206540,kennyman,2008-05-26 17:07:00,737,"There's a story to the name my boat has adopted. I arranged for my ten year old son and I to pick up our boat in Kitchener while my daughter was taking her Irish dance lesson. I had picked her up late the week before while we looked at it, negotiated and left a deposit. Everything went according to plan and we even got back on time to pick her up. So she's a good ole boat. The guy I got it from was given it by his grandfather almost thirty years ago. She's had a few paint jobs and dents along the way. Now it was sort of a teal/aqua blue with white and kind of a minty green showing through in spots (depending how deep the scratch was). Somehow even with the boats appearance should we respectfully say ""less than perfect"" I was still excited to show her, I guess thinking of the good times we were going to have in it.  So when my daughter walks out and sees the boat for the first time she says "" That is HIDEOUS"".  So needless to say she just named the boat and it will forever more be known as Hideous (in an affectionate way LOL)."

The reasoning is; I will be washing a lot of lures with this boat,   and it is a, IMO, a humorous way of proclaiming that I am not the worlds' greatest fisherman. So..., I am wondering what did you name your boat and why."
