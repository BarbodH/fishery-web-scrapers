206562,Victor,2008-05-26 17:33:00,1609,"i have seen it done @ Island Lake (it's also an electric only lake). In fact the day i was there, i saw a real nice bass boat with like a 250hp engine that launched in there."
206621,Burtess,2008-05-26 19:29:00,901,Best to call the conservation authority and ask....  (905) 854-2276 or (905) 854-4342 or [emailÂ protected]  Burt
206688,jediangler,2008-05-26 22:16:00,1923,It's a crap ramp for sure. It's an old road that runs into the lake. All gravel and mud and very shallow. If you have a 4wd you might be able to get in far enough to launch but it's always harder getting the boat out. It really is a small lake and all you need is a canoe to fish all of it. I asked them why they don't drop a load of fresh gravel there but they said first they would have to do an environmental assesment on the effects.

206983,Victor,2008-05-27 12:50:00,1609,"As far as running your boat in the lake with the motor tilted and only using the eletric, i don't think there's a problem with that. But as jedi said it might be difficult to launch."
207057,BITEME,2008-05-27 16:11:00,1969,i DROP MY 14 WITH A THIRY IN QUITE A BIT THERE IT IS NOT AN ISSUE The ramp sux but you can launch best to go this time of year before the weeds choke it though
