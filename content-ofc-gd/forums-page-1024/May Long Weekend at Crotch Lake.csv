206802,Badger Shark,2008-05-27 01:46:00,291,"We left early Friday morning and headed up to Crotch lake, yes that is the real name.  So when we got to the lodge Terry, Andy, Dave and Andys son headed out onto the lake, they didnt wait for me :cry: , I had a bunch of re-wiring to do and set up.  So after 20 minutes or so I headed out.  I went straight to my favorite area of the lake and started fishing the way that is most sucessful for me there and on my first trolling pass I got 2 eyes then a pike, also lost 2 eyes.  After that things were a bit slow.  I ended up with 8 fish for the day including my PB pike for this lake, sorry I dont have the pic, it is on my buddys cam..  My eye pic is here hopefully.  [/img]  The other guys were doing there own thing and I belive they got into a few as well.  This lake is tough to fish and it does help to have fished it alot.  As some often say,  try finding an area on your own and it is rewarding when it turns out to be one of the best spots on the lake.  I did share this area with the guys and told them what I do here and it does work.  Over the 4 days there were around 36 fish brought into my boat, we dont count pan fish.   I actually caught a catfish in this lake and thought there werent any.  Here is a pic of Terry and his new ride.      Here is JPS rocket that he brought up, 21ft Lund with a 200hp Merc on it. Not to mention it seems to have come with My wife who is fishing in the pic and my friend Kathy.   My wife got a pike as well and that is what she said she wanted to catch.  Here is a shot of the sunrise one morning we were out.   Here are some visitors that joined me.     Here is Andy standing up in his boat and Terry in the background.   Here are a couple of eyes Eric got on Monday.    A typical pike.   And a not so typical pike caught by HOS who to give you an idea of the size, is 360lbs.  The pike weighed 11.8lbs and was 36.6 inches long.  Look at the size of the gut!    All and all a great weekend away even with the typical Crotch lake weather and it hailed on us for the 3rd straight year.  Hope you guys, Andy, Terry, JP, Dave and Jamie ( is that your sons name Andy? I forgot) had a good time.  JP I think you may owe Kathy a dinner or something for the rod poking incident, the scary thing was it was meant for me! :shock:  Hope the pics work.  Don"
206808,danbouck,2008-05-27 01:50:00,4380,Great Report!
206813,MoriaRiverMan,2008-05-27 01:56:00,314,Great spot.........  Grew up camping there as a kid..........   Such a shame to see it over crowded now.  When we started going there you had to use a 4wd to make it in.  You would be lucky to see anyone all weekend there back then....  Fishing was tough back then to........  Havent been out there in years though.............  we stopped going as it got more crowded.  what end of lake did u launch at?   lodge or other end?  At the far end if you troll about 500 feet out from launch you will score up walleye

206819,jdmls,2008-05-27 02:04:00,575,nice report...where abouts is the lake located
206821,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-27 02:05:00,435,You've got the wrong hat on in the first pic   ....Awesome pics and report!  -Ben
206838,Badger Shark,2008-05-27 02:20:00,291,"We always stay at Tumblhome Lodge.  It was not to crowded at all, I think it has something to do with the dollar. Usally there are alot of Americans there but this time it was mainly Ontarians.  The lake is located near Sharbot lake off Hwy.7.  Ben, I am a man of many hats  I am a member of the other site as well as this one.   I would however like a OFC hat to wear.  I actally wear two diffenet hats fishing depending on the weather, if it is sunny I have a hat with a hanging down to the shoulders part at the back to keep the sun off my neck kinda like a desert hat.  The lake and surrounding area are really beautiful and the owner of the Lodge is a fantastic person and always treats us well.  Moira man, the area you wrote about, 500 feet from the launch is closed to fishing right now according to the regs map, it is a sanctuary from the incoming stream to the mouth of Macleans bay."

207084,Badger Shark,2008-05-27 16:55:00,291,"This lake is mainly a walleye and pike lake , there are no lakers in there.  I have been going there for the past 8 years and have never seen one or heard of one being caught.  I have spoken to Ward and a couple of the guides about them and they say they have never seen any.  But who knows maybe there are some lurking around."
207106,Stoty,2008-05-27 17:40:00,2910,"I think he is talking about the Algonquin ""Crotch Lake"" when he said lakers."

207190,misfish,2008-05-27 21:02:00,29133,"This Crotch lake you speak of,is near Dunduck (sp?)  Great report"
207456,Badger Shark,2008-05-28 02:49:00,291,"Its about 45 min to an hour north of Kingston near Ardoch.  Its not in Algonquin, I had no idea there was more than one lake named Crotch."
