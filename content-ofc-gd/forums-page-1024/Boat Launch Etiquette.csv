207563,Victor,2008-05-28 12:58:00,1609,I came across this article in the Ontario Out of Doors website today and thought that it would be a good read for everyone especially the ones who is going to launch their rig for the first time.  Boat Launching Etiquette  Safe boating and tightlines everyone!
207574,Greencoachdog,2008-05-28 13:31:00,8163,I like the part where the writer states his temper flares when someone cuts in front of him while he's untarping his boat!  ... that would make HIM a Boat Launch Bozo!
