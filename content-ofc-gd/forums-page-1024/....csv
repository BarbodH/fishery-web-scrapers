207360,Daplumma,2008-05-28 00:56:00,1961,"Now I know why you are like you is.You been cookin lead in your toaster oven and then cookin pop tarts and hungry man dinners in the same oven.Looks good bud,that pink will look good on you. Joe"

207478,Reel Nauti Pirate,2008-05-28 03:37:00,52,Here are some RJT sickle hook jigs made by a friend of mine they are all the rage on the Detroit river and Lake St. Clair. 
207501,wuchikubo,2008-05-28 06:02:00,1114,"Glen, those look great and I'm sure you'll have some paint bitten off them soon!"
207504,jace,2008-05-28 08:17:00,472,"the jigs look great.  I can offer 2 tips to you.  -  unless you want a solid line where 2 colors meet, tap on the highlight colors with a dry brush.  they'll look airbrushed like factory jigs.   -  to make the colors pop and smooth out the whole look, use clear coat powder when you're done.   you'll wonder why you never leave it bare colorcoat again.    It looks like you have about 5 colors.  If you have big containers, do you want to trade a few?   I have maybe 25 colors...enough of each that i'll never use it all."
207506,OhioFisherman,2008-05-28 08:39:00,6623,"Nice job Glen! Walleye are dumb, they eat bass lures. Black or white might be the only colors you need.  Hobby shops sell glitter and an epoxy clear coat that you can add the glitter to and get some flash on the jig. I think some tackle making catalogs also sell some glitter that can be added to powder paint.  You can modify colors of powder paint by mixing them, I had some bright green I made into a green pumpkin by adding black to it.  Best colors for me though have been white with silver glitter and black with a emerald glitter. I used to get the powder paint for free so mixing and messing up wasn`t much concern. One of the tool stores sells one pound cans(I think 1 pound) of basic colors of powder paint for like 10 bucks, much cheaper than the tackle places and works the same.  Cabela`s and Bass Pro shops sell eye busters for removing paint from the jig eyes, the powder paint is a lot tougher than conventional paint though.  Mustad 32746BLN is a decent hook for most species, like 10 bucks a hundred for 2/0, cheaper if you buy by the thousand. Also a longer shank version is available, don`t know the number off hand but might be a better hook for jigs tipped with crawlers."

207035,BillM,2008-05-27 15:29:00,17367,GCD good job man!!!!!!!!!!  One thing I would do it sharpen up the barb that holds the plastics on... I always find that they slide off the jig way to easily.
207036,yellowboat,2008-05-27 15:31:00,211,Nice looking jigs.
207037,lew,2008-05-27 15:33:00,12767,Lookin good there Dawg !!  Guess you'll be trying a few of those on the West Arm in a couple weeks ??
207046,bassjnkie,2008-05-27 15:47:00,1101,That's talent!! WTG!!!  Daniel
207047,PERCHER,2008-05-27 15:47:00,787,Nice work Glen.Now just tie them all together and make one of those fancy zibiki rigs. Dan
207048,fishnsled,2008-05-27 15:48:00,3520,I'd buy them.  Nice job GCD!  Now get out there and bang some paint off of them.
207049,Zib,2008-05-27 15:48:00,369,Nice job painting those jigs. Did you use a fluid bed to paint them?  I just started painting my own walleye jigs this year with a fluid bed. Using the fluid bed uses less paint & gives a nice even coat. I use a heat gun to get out any imperfections then put them in the toaster oven to cure them.
207061,Bernie,2008-05-27 16:16:00,3190,Nice job there Glen! I find the pink/white and the lime/white work very well on Nipissing.
207063,Roy,2008-05-27 16:17:00,13728,"They're really nice there, Glen. Colors are great! Nothing like walking into a kitchen to the smell of fresh baked lead."
207065,BITEME,2008-05-27 16:18:00,1969,Nice!!!! but do you have the Still going for a batch for Lakair

207110,ccmtcanada,2008-05-27 17:48:00,7971,Nice work Glen!  I take the lazy way out...I get mine from Bernie....LOL.  I'm sure they'll be catching plenty of fish....take Bernie's advice for Nipissing!!
207118,Spiel,2008-05-27 18:17:00,9065,....So how do I go bout placing an order?
207128,Sinker,2008-05-27 18:27:00,8692,Not bad for a retnek  I've never tried a jighead like that........might just have to give them a shot.  Sinker
207132,Joey,2008-05-27 18:32:00,9122,"That is awesome G, those look great.  Bring some up to Lakair and we'll have a swap meet.  Joey"
207137,wallyboss,2008-05-27 18:45:00,1095,Nice work.  I wish I had that much patience!!!
207139,Rattletrap2,2008-05-27 18:46:00,1652,"Very nice work!  Now, don't do something foolish like disturbing them from that nice, neat, organized black cloth bedding and toss them carelessly into a tackle box...or even worse, actually tie one on and get them wet!!!!!"
207146,Billy Bob,2008-05-27 18:59:00,5865,"Greencoachdog,  What I found to be better than paint is a plastic dip on my jig heads. It NEVER chips off. Only problem is after dipping you must hang them for about 15 minutes and then go back and clean out the eye holes on the hooks with a bobkin or similar tool. The dip shrinks and takes form to what ever is dip into it.  Fishing rocks really chips off paint but the plastic dip is indestructible.  BTW nice looking jigs. They will catch many fishermen errrrrr walleye"
207151,Spiel,2008-05-27 19:11:00,9065,"  ....Yeah yeah, what Joey said. I'll swap you for some of dem der jigs."
207250,Reel Nauti Pirate,2008-05-27 22:27:00,52,May I be as bold as to suggest trying a sickle hook when making your jigs? The hook up with a sickle hook is far better than any other hook I have used. $.02 added.
