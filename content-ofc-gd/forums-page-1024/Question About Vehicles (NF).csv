206243,holdfast,2008-05-26 01:10:00,1813,"Man I just dont get it.  Gas is going up like crazy and everybody wants an SUV.  My vote would be go for a small wagon like the toyota Matrix. Unlress you want to tow a monster boat.  Roomy, great on gas, good resale, CHEAPER.  Now as far as government gas milages.  Be aware some companys test their cars with the wheel rotating on a Mileage wheel, like a stationary bike with no resistance."
206270,solopaddler,2008-05-26 01:53:00,8605,"As mentioned I've already got a Honda Accord. The 2nd vehicle needs the cargo capacity to take the whole family up north with all our gear, something I do on a regular basis. I actually looked at a Jetta TDI diesel wagon, doesn't get much more practical or fuel efficient than that. It just wasn't quite big enough though..."
206281,jediangler,2008-05-26 02:15:00,1923,The newer Honda Odysseys have the engine management system that allows the motor to switch to 3cyl from 6cyl when the extra power is not needed. I think it started in 06 or 07. The Element is great if you can get past the styling. If you can find a Toyota Highlander with the 4cyl 2.4L that would be good too. Personally I like he new Scion XB for 2008.
206331,sirfish,2008-05-26 04:01:00,175,"Wow you thought Haldimand was overpriced??  They are one of,if not, the best priced car lots in the niagara penninsula. Check thier history, also you will be hard pressed to find a dissatified customer. That is the first place that comes to mind when someone wants a used car. They sell on average 30+ vehicle each day. Gotta be doing something right."
206369,solopaddler,2008-05-26 11:37:00,8605," I know they're competetive as far as private dealers go, but they're definitely, 100% overpriced. First off 90% of the vehicles on that lot are coming off leases and have around 100 thousand km's on them. They're priced roughly 2-3K more than they should be, plus you're paying 2 taxes. (I'll only ever buy privately. More room to haggle, plus only one tax). If you know where and how to look it's easy to find plenty of good deals out there..."
206377,holdfast,2008-05-26 12:00:00,1813,"Be careful with the Car sellers that advertise as private, then when you just about to close a deal they say that they have a friend who is a dealer to help with the paperwork.  Trust me, a lot (too Much) of that in the GTA, be wary of small dealers that come with an accent.  I came across that coincidentally on two separate occasions when looking for a used Honda.  Also coincidental both were from Afghanistan so they said.  Just Weird,  Also I had an investigator come to my house from TO to Wasaga after I had bought a Car. Seems the car sellers, dealer Buddie had reopened the Buisness using his sons name after being shut down for illegal dealing. Lots of Crooked robbers out there."
206383,solopaddler,2008-05-26 12:08:00,8605," You're right, there's plenty of ""curbsiders"" as we call them around here. If anyone's buying privately and something doesn't feel right it's best to just walk away. You can also spend the 20 bucks and get a carfax report on the vehicle. If you're careful and do your homework you won't get burned."
206387,John,2008-05-26 12:13:00,2956,"Mike, my choice probably would be a Passat TDI wagon. They are rare but one comes up now and again. There is a big however on this though.........if diesel continues to eclipse gasoline in price ($0.85 a gallon more than regular in Detroit on Friday) then I may rethink things."
206392,Victor,2008-05-26 12:20:00,1609,"Hey solo,  From reading your post it seems that you will need a vehicle ... 1) good on mileage, 2) have plenty of room for storage  I would suggest looking at the Mazda5. It's crossover minivan. Seats 6 and got lots of room, 2.3L engine and 157hp. It might be not be as powerful as the others ones you have in mind but it's good on gas. As you said you won't need to tow anything, I think it is sufficient. Great price tag as well.  I'd also suggest looking at the Nissan X-trail ... although i think CRV would be better but i don't know it too well ... just another one to look at  Good luck!"
206405,holdfast,2008-05-26 12:45:00,1813,"Good point with the car fax, you never know it could of been buried underneath the Red Sea in Winnipeg that year."
206414,Landlocked,2008-05-26 13:04:00,171,GMC Yukon Hybrid! (don't know about the price though  )
206447,solopaddler,2008-05-26 14:16:00,8605," Yep, I've looked closely at both of those vehicles. The Mazda 5 is the smallest minivan on the market, but still has worse gas mileage than the Odyssey and doesn't have the resale value. The XTrail is interesting. Only sold in Canada for 3 years (05-07), never sold in the States. Sold in Europe for years and very popular over there. By all accounts a good vehicle and very fuel efficient. Problem is I can buy a CRV for the same coin and I doubt the XTrail will hold it's value as well."
206460,Victor,2008-05-26 14:36:00,1609, o wow the odyssey actually does better in terms of gas mileage? good to know that ... good points made ... so i'm guessing CRV it is then?
206488,GBW,2008-05-26 15:14:00,8460,I have a Subaru Impreza Sport Wagon and love it.  When it comes time to get rid of the van (my wife's) I'm looking to get a Forester in it's place.
206566,ccmtcanada,2008-05-26 17:42:00,7971, Didn't you just sell a CRV Mike?  I know I know....it was an older model but still...the irony is there....
206583,solopaddler,2008-05-26 18:16:00,8605,"  Yep, and it was the best vehicle I've ever owned. Felt like something different for a change but probably shouldn't have strayed."
207022,Paulus,2008-05-27 14:53:00,522," I can second that. One of my neighbors owns one & he raves about his.  Otherwise, if the extra cargo space takes precedence, I'm afraid you'll have to take a hit to your mojo and join the rest of us who drive minivans  You couuuld also try out an H3... just kidding  p.-"
207025,solopaddler,2008-05-27 14:57:00,8605," I've looked at them, but just can't get past the rear suicide doors. Very inconvenient."
207026,Paulus,2008-05-27 15:01:00,522,"Also, speaking of MPG - this isn't really an option as far as travelling is concerned - this could be of interest to you. www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M88k6Ipp3c  I've been thinking about it seriously for myself, with basically the same choices as you Mike - probably a CRV or maybe one of the Hyundai 4c SUV's and the Zenn for local driving. It would work with our commuting pattern, and having the SUV as our second vehicle would mean that we have our out-of-town commuting/travelling vehicle.  Just have to wait until they become legal...   p.-"
206014,oncogene,2008-05-25 16:52:00,154,"hum, what are the 2 cars you have currently? which one is the ""mistake"" and which one u'r keeping? May help deciding which car to get now knowing what the other 2 are.   For resale value, since u mentioned it, that would mean going with Honda/Toyota or any other ""foreign"" brand names pretty much. American brand cars (unless it's luxury brand) have crappy resale value.   As for MPG.... do NOT believe in what the manufacturers say. Like those Malibu getting 40MPG, yeahhhh right. All of those numbers are from completely unrealistic condition, in lab, maybe no wind drag, ""highway speed"" is 70km/h, etc. Search online for some users-input REAL WORLD gas mileage database and see what the average ppl get.   I used to have a Toyota Rav4 (01'-06' model). I think the MPG was supposed to be very good, forgot exactly what.  But I had it for 5 years and my average was  like 15-20MPG, mixed city & hwy (altho probably much more hwy than city). Duno if my Rav4 was particularly bad or what. I think the current model Rav4 is even bigger so I'm not sure how the real-world gas mileage will be.  Altho in general, any 4wd will have worse gas mileage than 2wd that's for sure. So the 2wd minivan may be better than 4wd Rav4/CRV in terms of gas.   I ended up selling the Rav4 in late 05..... after Katrina hit US giving the excuse for gas to go up to $1.33/L, and that soon after me getting rear-ended with a loose bumper, and that I might need new tires for the winter ahead... I traded the Rav4 in for a Civic. Civic 26-37MPG average for me, best 100% hwy mileage (on cruise control) was 45.4 mpg.... and yes I've actually been recording down every single gas fill-ups in my computer since 05"
206110,solopaddler,2008-05-25 20:34:00,8605," Okay, well as mentioned I recently bought 2 vehicles. The first is a no brainer: 2005 Honda Accord sedan. Couldn't be happier with that one.  I've been fighting the inevitable (buying a minivan) for years. I still needed something with size 'cause of the 2 kids, and was attracted to the ones with AWD for my own needs.  This is the other vehicle I bought in Feb:    2005 Ford Freestyle. Considered a ""crossover"" vehicle, it's got AWD and a huge amount of cargo space. Built on a Volvo chasis, it's got a CVT (continuously variable) transmission. Absolutely LOVE the vehicle, but the gas is killing me!"
206127,Raf,2008-05-25 21:13:00,3495,"i'd have a serious look at the the subaru line.  i think the impreza may be a bit small for your needs but the legacy should be a fit.  30mpg may be a stretch - awd, decent size, unfortunately you have to pay to play.  the legacy has awd, comes in a wagon and can tow a small boat/trailer."
206135,Mike the Pike,2008-05-25 21:39:00,3421, The Subaru will use just as much gas as the Freestyle.One quarter for one quarter.  Subaru's are good cars but friends tell me they suck gas.
206138,huntervasili,2008-05-25 21:56:00,1604,"Well I have the Highlander and can tell you right now I drive pretty much 60% city 40% highway and my avg is approximately 14L/100KM. No complaints for it whatsoever, have only had to do regular servicing and replace a headlight in the couple years that I've had it."
206140,Mike the Pike,2008-05-25 22:01:00,3421,Mike what kind of commuting do you do alot of highway or bumper to bumper traffic.  I can easily achieve 600kms per tank with my Odessey around 65 litres on the highway on cruise 110kph  115kph but in the city the gas mileage sucks.  The van is loaded with gear and us 5.  My wife travels to downtown Montreal crosses the bridge bumper to bumper traffic 36kms per day round trip 5 days a week costs her $40 per week. its all bumper to bumper.  Its a tough decision when you need pulling power and space.  Oil companies are changing our way of life.
206200,solopaddler,2008-05-25 23:57:00,8605," Actually Mike the boat stays up north at my camp year round so pulling power isn't necessary. I'm definitely going to consider the Odyssey, it's a very practical choice. It's just hard for me to give up the 4WD though... When I move at the end of June my commute will be about 30 minutes one way on mostly country roads, so not too bad.  As far as the Subarus go, yes the 6cyl version of the Outback and Forester aren't too great, but the base model with the 4cyl engine is very good.  And Bill, I'm definitely keeping the Highlander in mind, I kind of like them. If I can find one at the right price I'll be taking a close look.  Thanks again everyone for the input, it's a big decision that I'll likely have to make pretty quickly sometime in the next week or so and I don't want to make another mistake!"
206232,Raf,2008-05-26 00:46:00,3495,"oops, i meant forrester and outback.  legacy is their big sedan.  i'm just not sure how much the 2.5 4 cyls can tow.  i know a few people who've owned them, mostly impresas and the legacy - they've have have had zero complaints other than the guys who've blow their impresa 6 spds racing   .  reliability is great and resale value is probably close to toyota's.  i can empathize with your feelings about 4/awd.  last 5 vehicles.. ever since i bought my 1st one.  even a turbo talon (sports car) was great in poor weather/roads."
206241,holdfast,2008-05-26 01:09:00,1813,"Man I just dont get it.  Gas is going up like crazy and everybody wants an SUV.  My vote would be go for a small wagon like the toyota Matrix.

206242,oncogene,2008-05-26 01:09:00,154,"well if towing isn't what u'll need, I'd definitely go with a mini-van in Odyssey. Roomier, and for sure better gas mileage, and IMO cheaper (if consider the same kind of options).  Yes, it's tough to go from 4wd back to 2wd... from Rav4 to Civic for me.... even the Honda dealer was like ""woh that's pretty rare for ppl to go back"". I got stuck in snow on driveway maybe couple of times a winter in the Civic.... never got stuck even once for 5 years in Rav4. But I'd gladly take couple of inconveniences a year for 50-60% better gas mileage these days in a heart beat."
