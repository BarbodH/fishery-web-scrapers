207031,solopaddler,2008-05-27 15:16:00,8605,"Rene beat me to it, LOL!  You can't miss them, they're at the end of their driveway right on the road. That's where I bought the tank for my camp  ."
207038,highdrifter,2008-05-27 15:33:00,2534,Whereabouts TJ?  I could have my dad hold them for ya!
207075,TJQ,2008-05-27 16:35:00,7806,"Thanks guys... IM going up on Friday, ill stop in and pick one up... is it north or south of the CT/Walmart complex??"
207120,wallyboss,2008-05-27 18:18:00,1095,"Past it,  between New Lisk.  and Earlton"
207122,solopaddler,2008-05-27 18:20:00,8605," It's north a few km's outside of town on the right side, can't miss it. Couple things: You should be able to get one for 200 bucks, not sure what his prices are now but I wouldn't spend any more. Second, make sure you clean and rinse the tank THOROUGHLY before you use it. They're usually used for spraying pesticides..."

207257,HTHM,2008-05-27 22:33:00,4082,"You may want to stop here ( http://www.tscstores.com/pages/locations/n...newliskeard.php ) first and see what a new one would cost....rather than taking a chance on contaminates in your water. If you are showering with this you will be ingesting the water, and that needs to be looked at. Just my humble opinion"
207278,TJQ,2008-05-27 22:59:00,7806,opinion s noted!!
207300,Zamboni,2008-05-27 23:32:00,235,"You guys talking about big plastic tanks with steel cage? I picked one up for a buddy's camp a few years back-it had juice concentrate in it. Hosed it down at self clean car wash (no soap) on way in and it was spotless.  Be careful, guys damage the big plastic valve close to the bottom moving these things around....make sure the one your getting is in good shape. I found a reducer pipe fitting attached to one tank we needed so take a few minutes to look things over."
207337,DogBoat,2008-05-28 00:21:00,7,Just bought one last weekend there.  About a mile from the feed store on the right hand side.  Big white one with the bungs on the top.  I believe the sticker on it said it was from CocaCola?  Using for rain barrel for shower use as well. $20.  There is also a dealer in North Bay just below the big hill - Airport road to the ease about a mile down.  They were closed on Sat when we drove up but they listed that they sell barrells as well.  I believe $30 each.  ../ Brian
