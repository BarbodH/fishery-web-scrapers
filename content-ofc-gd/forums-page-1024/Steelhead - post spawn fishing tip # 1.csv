207276,silverstreak,2008-05-27 22:58:00,146,OK so there are still some steelies around and you are doing more casting than catching. Try these helpful tips: BLEND IN and that means wearing Camo type clothing. Get on your hands and knees......Think like a predator and not an Angler. Remember -  Angling presure will shut down the bite more than anything else........do some leg work. Get away from the roe.....steelie below (like many others) hit a Brown/Olive Riverwood Jig combo. Happy Hunting and Please remember to let 'em swim.
