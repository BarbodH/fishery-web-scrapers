206989,cranks bait,2008-05-27 13:12:00,721,I have a 1993 Lowe Stinger 170 w/ 50 Rude.  Great boat.  I have no problems.  i am selling it only because I want more.  Two foot itis has gotten to me.
207021,Garyv,2008-05-27 14:51:00,547,"I have a Lowe 165, had it for the last 12 years.  Was going to buy a new boat but since the boat has everything I require to fish, and has never given me any problems I just decided to upgrade to a Honda 50 and keep the boat.  I think they are great value for the money. Here's and older picture. "
207055,Zib,2008-05-27 16:05:00,369,"A friend of mine had a Lowe 175 FM, which is the same boat as the fish & ski but without the walk through windshield. It's a good boat as long as you don't plan to take it out on the big water. My buddy had his out on Lake St. Clair in May of '07 & ended up with 5 cracks in the bow from running across the lake in 1 to 2 footers. All the cracks were on the welds."
207068,taper,2008-05-27 16:21:00,611,"A guy at work had a 2004 Lowe FM 175, took it out on Eerie in moderate waves nothing huge and the main seam let go. He had to run the bilge and bail while his body drove the boat back to shore. The good news is Lowe did come good for the hull warranty but he lost his boat for the biggest part of last season."

207284,pikehunter,2008-05-27 23:04:00,1659,"The riveted hulls are good, but welded hulls?  I have a 2005 Lowe 1667T, fine boat but it's bare bones so there's not much to screw up on it."
