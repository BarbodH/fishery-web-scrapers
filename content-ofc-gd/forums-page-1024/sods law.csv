I  was reeling in against a strong current as i am 300yrds upstream from the rapids and was pulling what felt like dead weight for about 30secs, thought it must have been a stick or log.  Then wham, i just think the fish did not know it was hooked for a little while, cuz it went nuts...i could feel the head shakes and thought....definitely a jackfish.  After what seemed like longer than probably 15 secs i get a look at what i'd hooked into.....BIGGEST WALLEYE IVE EVER CAUGHT!! it was probably 5 or 6 pounds in weight and around 35""? dunno really but i know it was bigger than my previous PB. What really sucks is that for probably the 1 time in a thousand i dont have my camera with me while fishing i get a PB...oh well. I was using one of those Northland Thumper Jigs (orange) with a twisty tail grub...caught 3 eaters as well.  Cant wait till tomorrow either, i'm off work for 4 days and i finally get my motor back from the shop so should be out in the boat.....AT LAST!!!!"

206906,fatherof3,2008-05-27 05:48:00,1769,always the way.
206970,rhare,2008-05-27 12:30:00,387,    LOL thats the best tip I've heard yet
206979,Victor,2008-05-27 12:42:00,1609,"I think this is a golden rule that every angler should know. To catch your PB, leave your camera at home. haha.  I'll believe you this time  haha"
206993,blaque,2008-05-27 13:35:00,2419,nets a cameras are always a big no no
206998,limeyangler,2008-05-27 13:52:00,5204,"Yup, did not have a net either....lol...but still managed to land it."
207002,Joey,2008-05-27 13:57:00,9122,"Yep, that's how it goes.  But you have it in your memory, where it counts, and you had the adrenaline pump  Joey"
207172,johnnyb,2008-05-27 19:57:00,3413,"Nicely done....what you need to do is have someone sneak your camera in with your gear, so's you don't KNOW you have it....then when you nail a beast like that walleye, you find it while rooting around for some pliers.    Nice job on the big fish!"
