It is slow going for the last hour and logging trucks can make for exciting blind corners. If its a wet spring you  will definately be in for a slow long run in. Be aware of washouts, and bring a spare tire, and a kidney belt wouldnt hurt either lol. Were back again June 17 but are getting picked up at Gilbert Lake this year.  Last hour of the drive can be interesting, we ususally see bears along the way. The Lodge is under new ownership the last two seasons and as before, still in the Brossard family who always aim to make your stay enjoyable. The early owner and the one and only Crazy George is one of the most interesting down to earth guys ive ever had the pleasure to meet.... even let me fly his plane . Always look forward to Caesars, this year is no different!"
