207482,HTHM,2008-05-28 03:48:00,4082,"I bought corvalus 401 in BC and found that a left hand retrive is no good for me. Contacted Shimano Canada, and they VERY kindly offered to exchange the 401 for a 400, which is the right hand model. I was impressed by this to say the least. I have to cover shipping of my reel to them, however that is quite fair considering they are under no obligation to correct my purchase error. So I would like to publicly thank Shimano for doing this for me!"

207513,Spiel,2008-05-28 09:27:00,9065,....Well that worked out well for you.
