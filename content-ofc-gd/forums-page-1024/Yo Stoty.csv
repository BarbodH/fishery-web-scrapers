206640,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-26 20:00:00,3761,Im thinking the Dechoke Red Wings....sorry the Detroit Red Wings
206764,danbo,2008-05-27 00:41:00,2646,
206811,Stoty,2008-05-27 01:54:00,2910, And that makes the scoreless Penguins what exactly? 2-0 heading into the third!! woooo
206812,danbouck,2008-05-27 01:56:00,4380,Ahhh... they are just toyin with ya. Pens will score 6 in the 3rd
206864,Stoty,2008-05-27 02:48:00,2910,"Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Another shutout!!  Very classy third period from the Penguins........  Roberts with the blind-side punch to the head of Franzen....(who just returned from a concussion) Sykora running Osgood with a minute left. Roberts goes after Datsyuk.  Hey Gary....be careful you dont break a hip, you old man!"
206900,danbo,2008-05-27 05:22:00,2646,Here's your new hat to celebrate with..  http://www.pimphats.com/ecatalog/product_i.../products_id/51
206925,brifishrgy,2008-05-27 09:54:00,559,  Franzen .. back the next shift .. cant take it dont play (he is getting good at diving.. good thing its an olympic year)  Osgood flopping around like a fish outa water .. what a display of sportsmanship .. if it wasnt for the Detroit Defence blocking shots and stoping the Pens offence Osgood wouldnt  look so good now would he .. heck with the defensive play of Detroit Raycroft would look good  Roberts might be old but he plays with alot of heart .. if half the pens team would play with his determination they wouldnt be in the trouble they are in now  hopefully the Pens can pull it together at home
206935,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-27 10:54:00,3761,And tomorow Pittsburgh comes back with 4 straight!!!
206951,BillM,2008-05-27 11:47:00,17367,"  Playoff hockey, I guess you've never seen it before?  The Pens could only dream that they had someone like Roberts on the bench, I still curse Toronto for trading him."
206955,Stoty,2008-05-27 12:02:00,2910,"Its not a dive when you get a left hook to the chin while the guy comes up from behind you.  Sykora leaned and an hit him with his shoulder. No need for that. Osgood might have embellished a bit, but there was no need for him to lean into Osgood at all.  LOL, playoff hockey isnt running goalies, and blind-side punching people in the head. Its playing hard and tough, not cheap and stupid. Then again, the Pens are actually playing a decent team (and getting dominated) so they dont know how to handle it.  I agree that Roberts plays with a lot of heart, but he isnt using his head. He was looking for crap all game long. I guess he is still ticked about being a healthy scratch.  Pittsburgh's season is tomorrow night. If they win, they MIGHT make a series of it...if not...thanks for coming out. Either way, I cant see them winning 4 of the next 6 games.  P.S - Is that Crosby kid even playing? How about his buddy Malkin?"
207000,JohnAB,2008-05-27 13:55:00,178,"Osgood trying to butt end Ribero? That was what?  Must admit, the Pens are sucking bigtime. Crosby and Roberts only two who seem to be trying."
207007,Pinch,2008-05-27 14:15:00,231,  They don't have to dream.  He is on their bench!
207015,Stoty,2008-05-27 14:40:00,2910," Hahaha, I was thinking the same thing."
207129,bucktail,2008-05-27 18:28:00,1857,"Just like the Oilers in the 80's, the young penguins need to be schooled by a more expierenced line up before they ""graduate"" and take over the crown. The Wings rarely make mistakes and for a young team its a harsh reality  but they will be better next year and the years after. I am still holding to Wings in six but if they win the next game then get the brooms out."
