I have tried calling the phone they have on thier website as well as email them but no response, I have no idea how to register for these tournaments and the website does not have too much info. Can anyone help me out and let me know how to register or who to contact?  I was also wondering if there are any other Bass tournaments that I can enter this summer. Wanted to enter the WFN Bass Tour but a little too much money maybe next year.  Thanks"
