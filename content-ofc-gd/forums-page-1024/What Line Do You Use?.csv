206827,kemper,2008-05-27 02:11:00,2232,"All three.  For instance I went pickeral fishin from shore tonight, used 10 lb mono. Tomorrow I am going pike fishing and ill be using 45 lb PP and when bass season opens it will be a mix depending on conditions"
206845,Badger Shark,2008-05-27 02:27:00,291,PLine CXX and Power pro briad.  Really like the P line for eye fishing.
206881,Sinker,2008-05-27 03:29:00,8692," Yes. Fluoroclear is a fluorocarbon coated copolymer. It gives the invisible characteristics of pure fluoro, and the strength and durability of copolymers. I find it has better knot strength, and doesn't have as much memory. I find pure fluoro is a little too stiff for me, and it frays if you cast it too much. The fluoro clear is much softer, but still nearly invisible, abrasion resistant......and it hasn't frayed on me yet. Its cheaper than pure fluoro as well  Keep in mind, I""m only using it in 2-8lb test. For higher test fluoro, as a leader, I use Seaguar, and buy it in 25m spools. If I need anything more than 8lb line, I'm fishing for fish with teeth, and I use braid with a heavy fluoro leader.    Sinker"
206882,Crazyhook,2008-05-27 03:32:00,1154,"65,80 and 100 pound Sufix Performance Braid for my musky fishing have 12 pounds Key lime Sufix on my carp rig 20 pound S P B for my pike and bass fishing"
206884,Mike the Pike,2008-05-27 03:34:00,3421,My  favorite line is 30lb Stren Super Braid 9lb diameter.  Mono I like Berkley Trilene Extra tough.  I only use 6 to 8lb mono for trout.
206918,OhioFisherman,2008-05-27 09:05:00,6623,"I have used original Stren since the early 70`s, mostly a bass fisherman but at times all species. Not much luck landing hooked muskies on it, bad game plan."
206936,wgk36,2008-05-27 10:58:00,69,I use braid with fluro leader on all my setups. Only exception is mono in the late fall.  The braid ices up to easily.
207067,BITEME,2008-05-27 16:21:00,1969,I use 12lb P-line mono for everything Pike and Musky add a flexible 30lb leader
207177,TJQ,2008-05-27 20:09:00,7806,"8 or 10lb fireline, grey, is my line of choice!!"
207180,Rich Clemens,2008-05-27 20:16:00,3131,"I use 80# PP for my musky/pike rods. For bass, I am using 12# Stren superbraid. I have a couple rods with mono for pan fishing, but I don't use them very often."
207279,Moosebunk,2008-05-27 23:00:00,3970,"For Pike. 50lb Power Pro on the baitcaster. 20-30lb Power Pro on the spinning outfit. Both 30-45lb 9"" black coated steel leaders.  Fly Fishing. 9wt floating 555 series pike/bass tapered line.  14lb, 6ft mono leads and 8"" 30lb steel tippet.  Ice Fishing. Anything at all braided, but heavier stuff specific for pike 30-50lb Spiderwire, Stren or whatever old braid is kicking around.  For Eyes. 6-8lb XT or Maxima, OR, 10-20lb Power Pro on spinning gear.  Icefishing 10-20lb braids.  For Searuns. 8lb XT or Maxima."
207282,Raf,2008-05-27 23:03:00,3495,"bunk, do you use braid on your jiggin rods through the ice or just tipups?  i can't stand the stuff for jigging & retrieving on a reel.  absorbs water, freezes and turns into a mess on the reel.  i know youre not a hut dweller either lol!"
207717,Moosebunk,2008-05-28 20:53:00,3970,"I do raf.  Strictly braids now.  Understand though, most times the walleye here bite quite hard (when biting) and are being caught in 1 to 8 FOW below the ice. About two feet 90% of the time actually.  I can't remember fishing deeper than about 8 feet more than once.  The ice thickness can be 4 feet and when the fish run they're scraping my line in those depths across the bottom of the hole at up to 90 degrees.  When I used mono first getting into ice fishing, I lost a couple bigger fish when the line snapped likely from that friction alone.  With these dirty waters I decided no more chances as the fish aren't line shy anyway.  More than 50% of our pike are caught on walleye outfits, and 20% of those fish caught over 40 inches have been on walleye gear and small baits.  I've used Spiderwire, Stren and PowerPro and don't find the ice build up on the line much worse than mono, and on the reel because I'm using so little line fishing such shallow water it doesn't build up much there either."
207782,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-28 23:40:00,3761,Didn't know so many people use braid lines.
206716,mepps,2008-05-26 23:24:00,1301,"I used to use Trilene mono, now I use PowerPro braid 95% of the time."
206719,misfish,2008-05-26 23:34:00,29133," Oh man I beg to differ on that. I find it much more better. Yes poor english there.LOL Knots are tighter,the line does not curl or twist. To me it is the best bang for the buck. IMO"
206767,Sinker,2008-05-27 00:56:00,8692," I like the fluoroclear too. I always used Trilene XT ......for as long as I can remember. I tried the fluoroclear last year icefishing, and have been using it ever since.  I only use braid on casting reels, and mostly for musky/pike. I tried it last week on whities in simcoe, and it worked great, great hooksets, and feel.....but my bud using fluoroclear outfished me 2:1. I changed rods, and caught up using the fluoroclear.  Sinker"
206795,buckster,2008-05-27 01:36:00,530,Just wondering...... is the fluoroclear diffrent then the p line fluorocarbon?
206825,walleyemaster,2008-05-27 02:09:00,325,6 pound stren clear blue...always worked for me anytime of year...
