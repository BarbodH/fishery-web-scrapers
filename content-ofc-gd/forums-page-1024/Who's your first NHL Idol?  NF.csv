207125,Kirk,2008-05-27 18:23:00,347,"Mine was a group, led by another #27, Sittler, especially after watching his incredible 6 goal 10 point performance against the Bruins about many years ago (30) (untouched record and will probably never be repeated).  Sittler, Keon, Salming Ellis and gang and the good old days of bench clearing brawls."

207412,Cookslav,2008-05-28 01:48:00,1457," Yup...I'll third that one. He had a nack for important points, and kept the other team honest as well. All around just an exciting guy to watch."
207424,mepps,2008-05-28 02:05:00,1301,"Mario Lemiuex is still the greatest hockey player ever as far as I'm concerned.  Even though I live in Syd City, I'm a big fan of Alexander Ovechkin now."

207463,Baldy,2008-05-28 03:13:00,44,Maurice Richard was my hero until Bobby Orr came along.  #4 was God's gift to hockey.  Gretzky was a wimp.  You guys and your Leaf players!

206782,Moosebunk,2008-05-27 01:17:00,3970,"Raised a Habs fan, still a Habs fan, but Sens and Flames fan too.  Played hockey from 4 ti'll 17.  Was a smaller player on the team when in Tyke and Atom but a good and fast centerman or right winger.  Growing up Mats Naslund was the Habs player I idolized for his speed and play making ability.  Great assists player.  Could say my dad's favorite during that era too, Larry Robinson was a favorite of mine as well.  My bro was a Patty Roy fan all the way.  If I had to pick a couple favorites to watch today, Jerome Iginla, Alfreddson and Heatley."

206879,Mike the Pike,2008-05-27 03:25:00,3421,"  Same as Dan, Guy Lafleur.  Don Cherry once said the greatest Hockey line to ever play Hockey was the Line of Guy Lafleur,Jacques Lemaire and Steve Shutt.  When I went to the Montreal forum in the Seventies when Guy scored the crowd erupted like a roaring volcano.  To this day I have never seen a hockey game like the one I saw 33 years ago.  It was all goosebumps"
