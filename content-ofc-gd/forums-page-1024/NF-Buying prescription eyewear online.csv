207528,SlowPoke,2008-05-28 11:02:00,2984,My wife returned from the optometrist with a prescription for bifocals. This isn't going over very well with her. Turning 40 next week compounds the problem. She looked at some frames locally and prices are in the $500 range so I began looking online. It seems there are some huge deals to be had but I would like to hear if anyone else has purchased thier eyewear online. -Brian

I have a couple of spare pairs from Wallymart, but  if I wear them for more than 1 hour they give me headaches.  But a good quality lens I can wear all day.  I use mine for reading only."
