272578,John,2008-11-27 16:35:00,2956,"I FISH ON FRIDAYS  A husband and wife came for counseling after 20 years of marriage. When asked what the problem was, the wife went into a passionate, painful tirade listing every problem they had ever had in the 20 years they had been married.  She went on and on and on: neglect, lack of intimacy, emptiness, loneliness, feeling unloved and unlovable, an entire laundry list of unmet needs she had endured over the course of their marriage.  Finally, after allowing this to go on for a sufficient length of time, the therapist got up; walked around the desk and made passionate love to her.... as her husband watched with a raised eyebrow.  The woman got up... and quietly sat down, as though in a daze.  The therapist turned to the husband and said, 'This is what your wife needs at least three times a week. Are you up to this?'  The husband thought for a moment and replied, 'Well Doc, sure, I can drop her off here on Mondays and Wednesdays..... but on Fridays, I go fishing.'"
