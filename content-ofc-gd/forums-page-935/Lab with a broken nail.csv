273263,Leecher,2008-11-29 13:56:00,7832,"kickingfrog, if you have a box of baking soda, dip the paw into it..... that should stop the bleeding. If it doesn't, a visit to the vet is required. Leechman"
273264,Gerritt,2008-11-29 13:58:00,6129,yup get him to the vet.. if not for anything but help with pain relief and to reduce the possibility of infection
273268,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-29 14:05:00,1362,"kickingfrog...here's a video clip from a vet decribing what to do with a broken nail!!...I had this happen to my dog years back and I used Cornstarch as a packing around the nail to stop the bleeding....this vet suggets flour...  Hope it helps...   http://video.google.ca/videosearch?hl=en&a...4&ct=title#  Once you connect to the link, choose the Emergency Dog Health Care: Tips & Techniques for Pet Owners ...  video on the left"
273270,Greencoachdog,2008-11-29 14:10:00,8163, Great tip Steve!!!
273287,bbog,2008-11-29 16:02:00,665,If it is broken off at the nail bed it will need a trip to the vet. It is tough to stop the bleeding with the remedies listed here and there is a risk of infection with an open wound. Quickstop will stop minor bleeding and breaks close to the quick but will do nothing (lasting) where the nail is broken close to the paw.  I'm sure it is quite painfull.
273331,kickingfrog,2008-11-29 18:02:00,8333,"Thanks for the help. A quick trip to the vet and $150 later and the dog's fine. The blood is all cleaned up. Now all I have to do when my wife gets home tomorrow from a shopping trip in Grove City, PA is explain that I spent more than her (remember my broken tv?) this weekend.  The backyard looks a bit like an animal met its demise though, lots of blood all over the clean white snow. What ever will the neighbours think?"
273342,irishfield,2008-11-29 18:50:00,26272,Rob... I've NEVER cared what the neighbours think!  Glad the pooch is okay!
273416,Leecher,2008-11-29 22:56:00,7832,"Rob, glad that everything turned out OK.  Thanks for the update"
273424,nofish4me,2008-11-29 23:23:00,404," If the neighbours haven't seen yor wife all weekend, I can only imagine what they might think. Hahaha"
