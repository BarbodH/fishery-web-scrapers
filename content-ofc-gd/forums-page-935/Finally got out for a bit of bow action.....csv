272757,Burtess,2008-11-27 23:19:00,901,"With work and the kids etc. etc. etc..... I havn't had any time to get out fishing this fall.  I took the day off today and decided to try a trib I had never fished before.  Only saw one other fellow out this morning and after that I was all by myself (which does me just fine!).  Had two on and lost them, one was a biggin' and fully straightened a #12 Mustad Wide Gap (mental note, must go back to the Raven Specialist).  This was more or less an exploratory mission as I seemed to do more walking and checking out this flow than fishing.  Did land this pretty lady though.   It sure was nice to get out again!!  Burt"
