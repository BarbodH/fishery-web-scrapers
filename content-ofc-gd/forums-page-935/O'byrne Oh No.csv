271701,Cookslav,2008-11-25 14:25:00,1457,Yikes!  Poor kid...Thats one of those nightmares that will keep replaying in his brain for a while.
271766,jediangler,2008-11-25 18:06:00,1923,This might be the best thing that ever happened to him. Now he may be traded to a decent team. There are worse things that can happen to a Montreal defenseman.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcSiJDGCwr4
271836,holdfast,2008-11-25 21:25:00,1813,"Oh my Gosh, no wonder all Komersrek did last game against Boston was just Yap and not put them up.  I guess it all up to poor George.  If they ever play him.   TIMMIES!!!!!"
272012,Mike the Pike,2008-11-26 02:48:00,3421,Crap happens won't be long the fishing reports will fade away during the transition period then the hockey rants will start.  I don't blame those leaf fans one bit they have no idea what the Stanley cup looks like
272014,irishfield,2008-11-26 02:51:00,26272,"DANG...  I saw ""Darsky""... ""O'Brian"".. ""A big fat"".. and thought someone was finally disputing O'Brian's muskie... but DANG .. another hockey melay !"
272030,Stoty,2008-11-26 03:21:00,2910,"Quite the way to score your ""first NHL goal"", wasnt it? Poor kid!"
272037,douG,2008-11-26 03:31:00,2693,Melee.

272192,walleyejigger,2008-11-26 16:56:00,876,"as a habs fan it hurt to see that, especially when they had a 1 goal lead, and end up losing  oh well que sera, sera  go habs go"
272457,darsky,2008-11-27 03:10:00,586,good on ya Habs-for coming off a humiliating loss and getting out of the toughest house in hockey with 2 pts.
272460,Leecher,2008-11-27 03:14:00,7832,GO HABS GO
272461,holdfast,2008-11-27 03:18:00,1813,"Get over it Darsky, I wouldn't brag too long.  Same team as last year.  They got lucky tonite, they'll fissile.  Same Timmies.  With Komerserk hurt The young Ds will have to step up.  Its too much to ask for.  When the forwards hit, they still turn their backs and use their rear as not to get hurt, of course with the exception of Kost and Begin.  Laraque is History as their not playing him.  Watch and shoot."
272467,darsky,2008-11-27 03:34:00,586,"Wow-a HF comment on the Habs w/o any Euro/Qc bashing. You must be in a good mood tonite. Hey,if I ever make it to Sask will I be offered the guided tour also???  Maybe a summer vacation to N.Battleford should be in the works."
272469,darsky,2008-11-27 03:36:00,586,  Wayne-we'll leave that to the experts. Can you say garden hose???
272478,holdfast,2008-11-27 04:07:00,1813," For sure Buddy, you're invited, the only reason why I didnt mention Euros is because since your an SKY, Its Russian.  So I didnt want to hurt your feelings because in this politically correct Canada.  Calling European Hockey players not as tough as North American can be construed to some people as Racist. And for some Habs fans, I would look like Hitler."
272481,darsky,2008-11-27 04:33:00,586,"No-not Hiltler and ""because since your an SKY,"" has nothing to do with anything Euro/Russian. The Holdster,Holdmeister,Holdarama.........Holdsky. Get it? And for the invite,its definitely on the 'to do' list.  btw-Calling European Hockey players not as tough as North Americans is fine by me and most I assume-its well in your right but the manner you have done so leaves bad tastes in MANY mouths."
272485,holdfast,2008-11-27 04:57:00,1813,"As you can see and hopefully respect, I like this board, and I dont care to win MANY (as you put it) popularity contests.  Again if your ever in Sask, let me know, love to know whats happening in MTL"
272592,otter649,2008-11-27 17:32:00,118,Almost as good as McCabe's gamewinner against Buffalo last year.....
272708,jediangler,2008-11-27 21:51:00,1923,"Jovanoski put one in his own net in Phoenix the same night, but it never made the highlight reels."
