268591,livinisfishin,2008-11-17 22:10:00,661,"Hey, anybody know of an ice fishing shelter that can fold up and fit into the back of my pontiac sunfire?"
268596,Roy,2008-11-17 22:21:00,13728,"The Pontiac Sunfire IS a portable ice shelter!  Sorry Bud, it was stronger than dirt. Are you looking for a one man shelter?"
268599,livinisfishin,2008-11-17 22:25:00,661,"ha nice one, well preferably a two person but i am not going to turn down a one person shelter if i like it."
268601,babaganoush,2008-11-17 22:30:00,105,does the back seat fold down???  if so the clam 2000 would fit
268603,livinisfishin,2008-11-17 22:34:00,661,"yeah it does, i was looking at that one on bps.com but havent gotten out to measure the interior space....6ft of snow to crawl through to get there"
268614,Roy,2008-11-17 22:49:00,13728,"The Clam ""HUB"" folds down to 45""x9""x9"" and weighs 19lbs. It's a two man 60""x60"" with a 65"" centre height"
268739,bigugli,2008-11-18 01:54:00,6138,"We have an HT Polar Express.  It is a folding backpack shelter, 1 or 2 man. Weighs 20lbs.  The enire unit unfolds not unlike a clam with a pair of collapsible seats inside. We have the rest of our gear on a small sled.  The shelter is darn good for being lightweight. One drawback, and I'm finding the same problem with a lot of canvas product.  A lot of the product sewn in thr Far East has poor stitching and cheap thread. It is only a minor inconvenience for me as I have had a lot of practice sewing canvas with a sailmakers palm. For most it would be a major problem."
268862,sonny,2008-11-18 05:07:00,511,"i'd go with the clam2000,,,the flip style hut won't fit in your vehicle!"
268905,crappieperchhunter,2008-11-18 13:21:00,2582,"I have a Fish Trap Pro which is a roomier one man flip style. Fits in my VW Golf no problem with the back seats folded down. Measure your car for space before you do anything and if you can fit a flip up portable in that is what I recommend you get. A little more money....but a far more user friendly hut. I have had both styles of portables, and would never go back to a hut that is not flip style.  Whatever you decide, good luck when we get some hardwater!!!"
269143,camillj,2008-11-18 23:14:00,1988,My 4 man Ice cube folds up smaller than a golf bag and weighs about 25lbs
269230,Bass_boy7,2008-11-19 02:42:00,10,"I use a Timber-wolf ice fishing shelter is a 4 man, its great and will fit in the trunk of your sunfire no problem."
269383,CaseyB,2008-11-19 16:55:00,6,I also like the 4-man ice cube. 3 years now and no problems even at -30 on Lake Nippising. Holds the heat well with my buddy heater on low and lots of room.
