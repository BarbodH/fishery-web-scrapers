Lost a lot of line in a hurry from not having settled into a rythm of drifts and trying not to horse the fish too quickly.  It snapped me off.  Three more drifts into the same spot and I managed this one below.  Was a nice battle but short lived.  She's darkened up on the bottom a fair bit.        About five drifts later, I hooked a real big brown which I never landed either.  Would have been a PB for me for sure. Then that was it, as fast as it turned on, it was over.  I made about 30 more drifts with different colour/size bags and never had another sniff.  So off I went home after a nice wind down to the work week.  BTW, I forgot my leader material and ran the same as my 8lb main line.  Some times it just doesn't matter."

273146,Leecher,2008-11-29 01:28:00,7832,Great report and pic nomad She's a real beauty    congratulation and thanks for sharing Leechman
273241,NAC,2008-11-29 13:05:00,369," Thanks Streamerguy. Very generous and I may take you up on it since that first excursion although being very productive, it cost $400 to repair the damage.  Maybe you'll be able to make it out too.  Jeff"
273246,jediangler,2008-11-29 13:23:00,1923,"Great pic and report nomad. Sorry to hear about the big brown that got away, you'll get her next time."
273294,ehg,2008-11-29 16:19:00,2666,"Great report and little tidbits. I guess fish are a little darker in the deep Niagara.  Back in the 1980's there was no flourocarbon leaders and many fish were still caught.  Nice little report, ehg"
273304,jwl,2008-11-29 16:47:00,1056,"good going on the fish, sometimes the river is just like that..get to a spot, catch or hook something first cast, then get a couple right away, and for the rest of the ay cast your arm off.     There is a good mix of fish like in your pic that have been in the river for a bit and fresh chromers since the temps finallt dropped over the last week or so"
