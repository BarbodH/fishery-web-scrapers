273005,PERCHER,2008-11-28 18:28:00,787,Great job Glen.I didn't know you were so incline.Next time your up maybe you can give me a hand with my landscaping.I seem to have problem with growing grass.Maybe it's just the location or maybe it's just me. Dan
273016,highdrifter,2008-11-28 19:08:00,2534,Nice work Dawg!  For a second there I thought you were gonna scare the BEEGESUS outta me..  You've got a real purty play ground for your Deere!  cheers HD
273129,Greencoachdog,2008-11-29 00:57:00,8163," Actually, it's in 4's... but I don't plant by 3's or 4's.  I plant by dimensioned spacing taking into consideration the size of the plant when full grown and the given area I have to work with.  ... call me ""old fashioned"".    No natural gas lines here in the cowntry, we have to have propane tanks for our gas needs.  Nothing would grow there because the ground was so hard and sloped, all the rain would run right off.   Thanks for the kind words y'all!!!  ... and for those that weren't so kind...........  kiss it!!!  "

273163,ccmtcanada,2008-11-29 02:06:00,7971,Nice work Glen!  Now...we have a few ideas for our backyard...when are you coming up to do that for us?  I promise you wont need to till for nearly as long....
273174,the spirit of fishing,2008-11-29 02:51:00,141,Great job-I applaude you for your ambition to plan and carry out the work and your patience for it to grow in Personally I look forward to the summer months when the grass drys up and doesn't need cutting so often..
273238,Greencoachdog,2008-11-29 11:59:00,8163,"  Actually, it doesn't spell anything... it's a scalloped rectangle with it's sticker pecking out!    Close but no cigar!... I'm an avid supporter of the NHRA!, the fish pond is down the road aboot 10 miles."
273239,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-29 12:32:00,1362,"Dang it Glen......that is one fine landscaping job you did there!!!  It feels good when you accomplish something like that doesn't it?...  That is ONE nice looking neighbourhood you live in....gotta love all the space and room between the other homes....just outa curiousity, what's the average size of most lots down there??"
273240,Greencoachdog,2008-11-29 12:48:00,8163,"yeah, they built all those nice houses around my ""house on wheels""... makes it look crappier than it really should, that's why I gotta work in the yard all the time!!!  Those lots are 1 acre lots = 43,560 square feet... aboot 43,000 more square feet than you want cut grass on, on a 100*F summer day!!!  Different developments have different size lots, but most around here are 1/2-1 acre."
273252,TennesseeGuy,2008-11-29 13:37:00,957,"Nice job Glenn.  I'm impressed with your garden tiller.  I'd have one just like it, but need to get between my corn rows.  Next spring bless us with photos of your Bonnie Plants as they develop and produce.  You and I are probably the only true vegetarians on the board as we grow our own vegetables."
273255,aplumma,2008-11-29 13:42:00,6896,Next time you need some dirt softened up just give me a call I will send my coon hound down he has turned out to being a champion digger when he buries his bones around the yard. Very nice job on the front lawn Glen.   Art
273310,Dano,2008-11-29 17:07:00,719,"I dunno, is it just me or does the design look a johnson after too many shots of Jimmy Johnsons.....?"
273312,irishfield,2008-11-29 17:09:00,26272,LMAO !
273315,douG,2008-11-29 17:20:00,2693,"A true artist's work.  Great stuff, Glen."
272906,Greencoachdog,2008-11-28 13:16:00,8163,"I consider myself somewhat of an amatuer landscaper, and enjoy digging in the dirt, planting and growing things. I like to do as much as I can in the yard to make my house on wheels look good!  So I had this nasty bare spot in the front yard for all to see when they drove by.   I've seeded it a couple of times in the spring, but during the long, hot, dry summers it would die back to this spot. The ground was just too hard, rocky, and dry.  So I decided I would end this eyesore once and for all... I broke out the tiller!... the real tiller!!!  ... and I tilled!... and tilled!  ... and tilled some more!!! I tilled for days! The ground was so hard in that area, I'd have had better luck tilling up the asphalt road!!!  Finally got it down to an acceptable depth and went to work on my design. Nothing out of a book and nothing drawn out... it was all in my little punkin head.  This the template for the serpentine edging I wanted. Installing the serpentine edging.  Once all the edging was installed, it was time tp put down the weedblock fabric. I use a construction grade silt fence Geotextile fabric and double it (2 layers).   With all the fabric installed, it was time to start planting.     When all the planting was finished I put the finishing touches on the mulch.   All of these plants prefer an arid ""desert like"" enviorment... which they shall recieve in abundance!!!  Blue Pacific Juniper, grows 1' tall and 6' in diameter. (6)   Old Gold Juniper (gold tips in spring) grows 18"" tall and 6' in diameter. (2)   Pfitzer Gold Juniper (gold tips in spring) grows 18"" tall and 6' diameter (2)   Bright Edge Yucca, grows to 24"" tall and will ""clump"" to about a 4' diameter with multiple plants, also has a 3' plume of bell shaped flowers in early summer. (4)   Blue Rug Juniper, grows 6"" tall and 6' diameter (4)   Salmon Oleander, grows 6-7' tall and has pink blooms all summer (1)... he looks kinda rough right now but will come out in the spring.  Well that's it, it was a lot of hard work but I think it looks better than it did.  Thanks for lookin'!"
272907,lew,2008-11-28 13:25:00,12767,"Lookin purty snazzy there, Dawg."
272908,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-28 13:33:00,2038,"Mighty fine looking job ,, Nothing like playing around in the dirt once in awhile.......  "

HEY......great idea.....you should visit up here with us Glen   I had to laugh......i could not help thinking that bare spot would not be a problem up here in November....hide it with 4 feet of snow
272910,kickingfrog,2008-11-28 13:34:00,8333,"Reel purdy dawg, but the first time the snow plow comes by all those low plants will be covered?  Me sooo funny."
272911,Roy,2008-11-28 13:37:00,13728,Good stuff Senator! Can we please have an aerial shot of that? I just want to know what you're trying to spell on your lawn.
272914,OhioFisherman,2008-11-28 13:56:00,6623,A lot of trouble to dig up some worms.
272915,Whopper,2008-11-28 13:57:00,2174,Well done Glen  Roy he may have tried to spell OFC but got cornfused
272917,Nemo,2008-11-28 14:05:00,727,Nice job GCD.... I really like the attention to detail and the workmanship.  I also looked at the satellite photos and it looks like it spells OFC  Nice work OFC in space.
272920,LeXXington,2008-11-28 14:27:00,1928,"very nice, looked like lots of work.."
272928,Headhunter,2008-11-28 14:56:00,5703,"Man o man.. some guys will do anything to get a couple of dozen ""red wigglers""! HH"
272935,silvio,2008-11-28 15:06:00,433,  What are you growning??  LOL  Good job bud... now time to go fishing.
272939,FLEX ROD,2008-11-28 15:11:00,394,"That looks like it was a lot of hard work, and it also looks great.  Wait till it catches and starts to fill in it will look even better and thats when the true reward comes in.  Great job,  FLEX"
272942,chickenhawk,2008-11-28 15:20:00,612,nice job GCD....i can respect a job well done when i see one i say i say   Hawk

272946,JohnF,2008-11-28 15:32:00,3494,"Hey Dawg,  If you ever wanna come up and fish the Thames I'll be happy to let you play in the mud on my lawn, provided it ends up looking as nice as yours.  JF"
272948,Victor,2008-11-28 15:34:00,1609,that explains the lack of shirtless report I saw on OFC this summer  Great job though! It looks amazing.
272958,TJQ,2008-11-28 16:00:00,7806,Nice job!!
272962,danbo,2008-11-28 16:07:00,2646,Atta boy!  That green thumb will match your green teeth now! You ol' Hillbilly you!
272966,bigugli,2008-11-28 16:18:00,6138,Great looking job GCD. Given 3-4 years to grow in sufficiently and it will look stunning.  Of course you do realize you broke the unwritten law of landscaping(who cares)    Planting in 3's. Rules were meant to be broken.
272973,Wild,2008-11-28 16:46:00,704,Geeeze landscape is rather flat there I was expecting something a little different   But nice job Glen I take it you are an avid supporter of the NRA? and where's the fish pond??
272978,BUSTER,2008-11-28 17:02:00,1336,"looks very nice ,  on a side note was the grass hard to grow in that spot or didnt grow at all? may be a reason for that and i have found small gas leaks on the gas pipe IF you have natural gas in the front Blvd, small leaks that go undetected usually dry up the soil to the point that nothing will go there, just thought i'd mention that, now if you dont have a gas pipe and the grass not growing in that spot wasnt the problem. please disregard...and very nice property!"
272990,packrat,2008-11-28 17:38:00,93,nice job indeed always liked to do gardening and such myself.           Did anybody notice that there are NO pics of GCD actually DOING the work tho??????
272994,SlowPoke,2008-11-28 17:46:00,2984,This is a family site... He gets half naked fishing. What do you think happens when he works up a good sweat?
272999,Roy,2008-11-28 18:01:00,13728,I've got a few pics of  GCD working but they aren't worth anything. Now if they were autographed!
