273055,babaganoush,2008-11-28 22:04:00,105,is anyone from the kapuskasing area??? just wondering about ice conditions up there i need to go ice fishing
273084,irishfield,2008-11-28 23:14:00,26272,Haven't heard anything from that far up.. but do know that one sleds already been lost close to town on Lake Temagami. Constant snow is hindering any safe ice formation.
273194,babaganoush,2008-11-29 03:25:00,105,thanks for the heads up how much snow do you have up there because i have a place in river valley and if theres enough snow up there than ill just take the sleds and go for a ride
273207,irishfield,2008-11-29 03:46:00,26272,Not sure how much snow they have on the ground in Temagami. We have over a foot here in Penetang! $*((*@*(@(##*($@$*(()!!!
