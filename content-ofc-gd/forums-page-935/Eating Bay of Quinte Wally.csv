271462,danbo,2008-11-24 20:51:00,2646,I'd rather cook & eat my wading boots than that freak!
271464,TroutSlayer,2008-11-24 20:59:00,64," Rest assured it doesn't just disappear.  Some gets to the ocean, some settles to the bottom of Lake Ontario.  The further you can get upstream, the less polution.  I agree, there is polution in all waters to some degree.  A fish from the north shore of Huron, has not seen the polution floating downstream from Windsor, Detroit, Buffalo, Sarnia, Hamilton, Toronto etc.  Think about the Don River, at its many headwater sources, it is fairly clean. After getting through Toronto and with all the drains and sewers emptying into it, it's not so clean at the mouth on lakeshore.  If a piece of human crap (commonly seen in Lake Ontario) does make it to the ocean, at least it's worn down to bait size and gobbled up by a fish."
271469,snag,2008-11-24 21:07:00,1932,Don't eat it! 
271472,highdrifter,2008-11-24 21:21:00,2534, Ya been saving that one eh?!!  LOL  HD
271508,Pinch,2008-11-24 23:05:00,231,"  If your going to have the carrots for dinner, just hope that the farmer doesn't use bio-solids!!!    lol"
271510,fishindevil,2008-11-24 23:14:00,6254,Yes very good point about the bio-solids !!!! the farmers spread treated human waste on their fieilds !!! its happening all over too....kinda gross isnt it????
271516,fishhunter,2008-11-24 23:29:00,604,Well to add my own 2 cents on the bay. In the last few years the fish seem to be better then ever. The last two years with no fish with any marks. I put alot of days on the bay with lots of eyes in the net and I can say fish seem to be better and better each year with lots of year classes being taken. I can only speak for myself not sure how others are doing with clean fish.
271531,canadadude,2008-11-25 00:05:00,769,"That fish is infectted with a virus, I' ve seen that in all great lakes walleye, in fact Erie fish it's common, it has nothing to do with the quality of meat for eating purposes but the virus is in the great lake population of walleye. It may not look nice to those harvesting fish for the table it is no threat to humans these viruses have been in the population for 1000's of years and in noway are a judge of the health of the population, or the quality of the catch for hunan consumption. In other words don't worry about Quinte eyes they still taste great and trust me if something is going to kill me ODing on quinte walleye is a sweet way to go"
271630,Ramble,2008-11-25 03:55:00,713,"A buddy targets Balsam almost every weekend for musky during the season. He said he saw a large increase in the number of fish with teh virus this year. THe fish is safe to eat, they usually contract the disease during spawning when they are weakened and in close contact with other fish.  The great lakes are cleaner now then they have been in a long time. Last year we did some modeling on lake ontario based on some chemical properties of a few contaminats to see where they go. Most are go into the sediment, and some are lost to the air. Ironically some of the worst ones for us stay soluable in water and those are the ones often turning up in fish. Bio-waste in water means eutrophication, and results increased prductivity....to a point. Anyone who has eaten a fish from a lake with cottages on it has eaten nutrients from human waste that was leakin in 20-50 years ago. It's called nutrient cycling. Life on teh planet depends on it.  As far as biosolids go. Regulation crack down on human waste was a few years ago. It doesnt go onto food for consumption. So don't worry about that. Farm manure goes onto our food, and its a safer alternative then manufactured fertalizer.  If you want to worry about something, mercury is a really good one, cause it's totally preventable in our society. Who has mercury amalgum fillings in their teeth?  Ground level ozone is another great one, especially if you think farming food is a good thing. Sulpher emissions are worthy of your time as is nitrogen oxide in auto emissions. Acid rain is getting worse again and its due to nitric acid this time. Another time worthy topic is genetically modified food. Strawberries with arctic char genes anyone? They are actaully crossing the phylum barrier if anyone cares? There is also factory farming, how about low frequencey radio emissions generated from little things like cell phones? More and more studies are showing a correlation with cancers after 10 years of exposre. Radio waves from communication towers in general! We have the worst regulations in the western world protechting people from the effects of radio frequencies. Its look likes up to 1/3 of the populaiton might be sensitive to them in some way. Did you know wind turbines for producing power can effect people up to 1km from their source? Canadian regs say 400m is a safe distance. Stay voltage is another worthy topic, and new legislation is in the works for that FINALLY. I can keep ranting here but i'm pretty sure i'm wasting someones time.  My point is contaminats in teh great lakes are monitored BIG TIME. There is a hell of a lot of other pollution issues worthy of everyones support like the ones i listed above that need monitoring and need public support. Hope you enjoyed the rant.  -R-"
272265,Guest steel'n'esox,2008-11-26 20:09:00,0,"We use to see them in the late 80s when I fished the ice on the bay, the smaller ones we kept to munch on, we deep fried them and washed them down with whisky. As long as you have whisky your good to go, whisky kills everything. Im off to the pharm for some liquid advil"
272473,Pinch,2008-11-27 03:59:00,231," Uhm I'm not so sure about that, the company that pumps out my septic tank was here a few months ago and was explaining to me that they pump the waste onto the local farmers fields.  That was where I first learned about biosolids.  Biosolids was also a big topic/platform in the recent election here in Northumberland."
272500,Silo Buster,2008-11-27 10:52:00,81,"   What Ramble On means is that they apply the bio's to land that is going to be livestock/ethenol grains.Not carrots ,sugar beat, onion,etc. fields.  Once a land owner applys biosolids(slugde)on a piece of ground,that ground is not supposed to recieve it for 7 years.(atleast thats the by law here in Oxford county)"
272629,Pinch,2008-11-27 18:57:00,231,  Ahh ok i see what he meant now.  Thanks for clearing that up.  I though his line stating 'food for consumption' was a bit odd.  lol
271355,Fish Farmer,2008-11-24 16:12:00,2234,I used to like eating an odd meal of small Walleye from Quinte. This is enough to make you stop eating fish any where. Sorry to upset your breakfast. Caught a few of these this week.          
271356,Marko,2008-11-24 16:16:00,854,Boy does that guy look rough. Looks like some kind of cancer or something awful.
271359,bigugli,2008-11-24 16:24:00,6138,It happens in all creatures wild and domestic. You should see some of the growths or tumors found on livestock during the inspection process. I worked a year at the old cattle yard in T.O. when I dropped out of high school. Blleccch!
271361,BITEME,2008-11-24 16:25:00,1969,Did you report this to the MNR they might need to know this ive seen something like this to a way lessor degree but you said you caught a few something is amiss send them the pictures   Peter
271362,Leecher,2008-11-24 16:31:00,7832,"Good god that is gross     I've seen some fish with a few but not to that degree Like BITEME said, send your pictures to MNR for sure Leechman"
271365,troutologist,2008-11-24 16:34:00,951,It would certainly be appreciated for you to report this. The tumor rate is used to determine if the contaminant load in an area is adversely affecting fish/wildlife.  In many cases this incidence rate is gathered through angler reporting in conjunction with scientific study.
271366,muskyhunter5150,2008-11-24 16:34:00,64,That's gross. I've seen some musky with smaller warts that look like that inside their mouths.
271371,Fish Farmer,2008-11-24 16:43:00,2234,"Bitme The MNR and Bios. know all about it. Thats why they warn people not to eat the Walleye from there. I've talked to the Biologist, they wouldn't eat a fish from L.Ont. This was only a 3LB. fish. They tell you not to eat anything over 24""."
271372,highdrifter,2008-11-24 16:43:00,2534,Looks like its mostly the fins that are affected... Maybe a parasite?  Poor thing musta got into a bad patch of weeds or something.  Just scrape em off..  I'd fry him up!  HD
271374,tonyb,2008-11-24 17:00:00,1637,"Hehe you guys are blowing things way out of proportion, that's a common viral infection called Lymphocystis.  Those growths have nothing to do with 'pollution' and are quite common in several species of fish and further are perfectly safe to eat (if you can get past the looks of it)  Here is a detailed explanation in PDF format for those interested.  http://srd.alberta.ca/fishwildlife/livingw...tumors_fish.pdf  Tony"
271376,tonyb,2008-11-24 17:04:00,1637," The Bio's recommendation is more likely related to bio-accumulation of toxins that are present in the Great Lakes, and all bodies of water really, including the ocean.  Refer to your guide to safe eating if you're really worried.  Then again, when was the last time you checked your guide to safe eating for poultry, chicken, beef, farm raised fish, etc....(is there even one? or better to not know?)  Wild meats are not 'enhanced' like all the other meats are, just remember that."
271379,Fish Farmer,2008-11-24 17:10:00,2234,A lot of unknown words there and rubber gloves?????? Thanks for the link. Tony
271380,Cast-Away,2008-11-24 17:12:00,790,"In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""It's not a tumour, it's a headache!"""
271382,jwl,2008-11-24 17:14:00,1056,just put lots of ketchup and plug your nose
271384,Fish Farmer,2008-11-24 17:17:00,2234," Thanks Tony, I just took a steak out of the freezer Maybe I'll just eat Carrots tonight for supper"
271388,bigugli,2008-11-24 17:27:00,6138,Then you really don't want to know what's in the ground meat.
271399,ccmtcanada,2008-11-24 17:50:00,7971,ACK!! You were right about that being graphic!!!  That fish is naked!!!!
271403,tonyb,2008-11-24 17:54:00,1637,"mmm Steak...I just had one last night, there is no avoiding contaminants today, just a part of life. Long live Cancer!  http://www.cbc.ca/consumers/market/files/food/beef/"
271411,Wild,2008-11-24 18:05:00,704," Yes there are alternative growers you can rely on, had a Angus steak this weekend free of injections and raised on good food. Well the natural BBQ smoke did not make it the healthiest but whachagonna do?"
271426,ehg,2008-11-24 18:50:00,2666,"Also called Lymphosarcoma, apparently affects esox and walleye in cold waters. The flesh doesn't get contaminated. Pretty ugly i would not eat the fish however. Was all over fall Kawartha muskies i caught 10 - 15 yrs. ago haven't seen it there recently."
271430,Joey,2008-11-24 18:58:00,9122,"Ahhh, a little salt, pepper and garlic and it'll taste just like chicken giblets  Joey"

271443,TroutSlayer,2008-11-24 19:48:00,64,"When you think about it, Lake Ontario is the catch basin for all the other great lakes.  All the toxic runoff, human waste and stuff we don't even know about from all the major cities (Can and US) end up in Lake Ontario.  Sure, some of it is treated, if it's not raining.  Tons and Tons of raw crap end up in Lake O on a regular basis, along with the many toxic chemicals you can't see.  Would I eat any fish from Lake Ontario (warts or not)?   Not a chance."
271448,Headhunter,2008-11-24 20:07:00,5703,"If one takes an objective look at the physical dimensions of The Bay of Quinte, an argument could be made that it looks like and to some degree acts like, the colon on the Kawartha's! That in it's self should tell ya something!!!! HH"
