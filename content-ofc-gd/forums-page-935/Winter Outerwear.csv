273079,BillM,2008-11-28 23:06:00,17367,I just picked up a RealTree Gortex 4 in 1 wading jacket a few days ago...  I can't wear anything but a t-shirt underneath it or I am sweating my ass off
273095,danbo,2008-11-28 23:30:00,2646,They are awesome!
273105,misfish,2008-11-28 23:51:00,29133, What was the price Dan??????? Never mind the ice.thats a nice suit for the hunts.
273123,danbo,2008-11-29 00:48:00,2646,They aren't cheap.. but it sure beats those floater suits IMHO.
273125,misfish,2008-11-29 00:52:00,29133,"  Well then,Im out.LOL"
273261,Canuck2fan,2008-11-29 13:53:00,1444,Looks good but at double the price of the Remington gear sold at Walmart it should be!!! Is it really windproof as well as waterproof?
