272624,mistyriver1,2008-11-27 18:37:00,600,This reel is often talked about on here and right now is  marked down to $99 from $189.99 with free shipping.  Thought you might want to mention it to Santa.  http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/prod...4008&r=view
272633,JohnF,2008-11-27 19:05:00,3494,What impresses me about that is that last spring I bought one of those in Stratford @ The Fishing Store for that price. He keeps telling me his prices are good.  JF
272636,JustinHoffman,2008-11-27 19:12:00,482,"Great reels for sure. Shipping is only ""free"" if you live in the States - and don't forget to convert that to price to Cnd. $'s.....  Do love my Quantum's - made the switch last year.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
272640,forrest,2008-11-27 19:18:00,1032,"Those reels seem to be on a huge sale or with a huge rebate at all times at one place or another.  I do not know if they were ever competitive at $190.   I picked one up (with bonus mono line) for $95 when the dollar was good  Here is another sale on them, I think this company buys advertising here: http://www.all-americanoutdoors.com/inc/sdetail/602($15, free shipping) http://www.all-americanoutdoors.com/inc/sdetail/337 (saltwater model)  forrest"
272643,JustinHoffman,2008-11-27 19:20:00,482,"Reason for the reduction in price is to make way for the new lineup of Quantum reels..  Good Fishing,  Justin"
272650,BUSTER,2008-11-27 19:30:00,1336,"as the wife would say  "" does bass pro do price match?""  canadian tire and zellers and wal-mart do"
272654,forrest,2008-11-27 19:35:00,1032, Thats what I was told in the summer too.  The only thing that seems strange about it is that the big rebate deals have been going on since late 2007. They have been clearing for a full year now?  forrest
272658,JustinHoffman,2008-11-27 19:41:00,482,"Forrest - many of the reel manufacturer's were offering rebates at that time - Shimano was another one. I believe that was to offer some incentives and to drum up business. This latest price drop is in order to get rid of stock - ""old"" models need to be cleared out to make way for the new...  Justin"
272742,hirk,2008-11-27 22:46:00,571,"Hope you live close to Gander Mountain so you can still pop in to get your gear when your local shop goes teats up because too many people chased ""the Gander mountain deal"" too many times? Oh wait they are in the USA aren't they????? Nothing personal but felt a need to make a point."
272772,mistyriver1,2008-11-27 23:39:00,600," Unbelievable...........Didn't think it was possible to get bashed over posting what you thought was a good deal that some might be interested in.  Next time, I won't bother.  As a matter of fact hirk, I do support local shops quite regularly....I felt I needed to make that point."
272775,BUSTER,2008-11-27 23:45:00,1336,"play nice in the sand box....i use small and large shops like many do iam sure, some large based stores have better deals than small , and some small have better than large.. i know i dont buy everything at costco cause i can get better deals for some stuff at mr'joe's store...cheers"
272790,forrest,2008-11-28 00:18:00,1032,  Another OFNer gave me some the other day.....I pass on the leftovers to you:  
272794,irishfield,2008-11-28 00:21:00,26272,That's the spirit Forrest ..
272798,hirk,2008-11-28 00:24:00,571,"Mistyriver1 I owe you an apologie,I am sorry,It was not intended or directed to you personally and I was not trying to slam you.I understand why you posted it and please keep posting,it was just a rant on my part reflecting my opinion on the subject of cross border shopping."
272818,BUSTER,2008-11-28 00:58:00,1336,way to man up!
272821,BUSTER,2008-11-28 01:07:00,1336,"iam a nobody by the way, just had to throw respect your way..."
272912,Whopper,2008-11-28 13:39:00,2174,  I'm kinda of glad cross border shopping/visiting doesn't bother me nor should it you.  I've never met any body in business north of the border refuse to take my money nor do I mind giving it to them if it's something I want.
273078,Greencoachdog,2008-11-28 23:00:00,8163," Yeah, but I just can't see someone smuggling Canadian cigs into the States!"
273390,Rich,2008-11-29 21:06:00,3927,Thanks for the heads up. Never been a Quantum fan but it's great that we can let others know about the good deals we find.
