Has anyone used them?  forrest PS there are reviews on the site but I trust this forum more."
273349,jwl,2008-11-29 18:58:00,1056,just a fancier version of that little wheel type thing they used to have out like 15-20 years ago...was just like a pie chart that had variable conditions on there and colour choices..I think most people that put alot of time into fishing various waters at various times of year already have a pretty good idea of what to run

273355,Terry,2008-11-29 19:16:00,14456,"I have used them..mine had a 50 ft wire and they do work but you end up looking everywhere for a purple spinnerbait because that's the colour it asked for  once you learn what colour to use on sunny days and dark days on each body of water, you will start leaving it at home and 15 years later be wondering where it is because someone posted a question about them    now where the heck did I leave it"
