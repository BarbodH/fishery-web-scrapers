272770,silvio,2008-11-27 23:36:00,433,It all started when my dad came home from work a bit early. I asked him to head out knowing I wouldn't have much time on the water. We got down to the river to see all the ice and snow melted and the water a bit too off color for my liking. We walked to the pool and every minute that went by it would get darker and darker I committed 3/4 my time to pink worms. With no success and our time coming to an end I tied on a pink/ purple jig. A few cast in a tree clamed my hole setup. I retied and put on a hot pink jig 2 drifts in I say to my dad its getting late... Shortly after my float drops and I set into this nice fish. caught it on a jig I tied last night it really made my day. Shortly after releasing the fish we left.

272859,bigugli,2008-11-28 03:08:00,6138,Nothing more satisfying than succeeding with a product fashioned  by your own hands.
272869,bbnotty,2008-11-28 03:42:00,93,"Good job bud with the short time you had. Nice work on those jigs, thats a really nice bow.  Berge"

272880,bbnotty,2008-11-28 04:21:00,93,"I might have to borrow a jig from you   . you tie them great, should be selling them."
272882,Paulus,2008-11-28 04:28:00,522," I second that  Nothing beats a wild fish, either. Good job!  p.-"
272884,silvio,2008-11-28 04:35:00,433,Thanks Paul maybe next time things will work out and we can meet up.
272885,silvio,2008-11-28 04:37:00,433, I posted in the classifieds I have allot of time on my hands.
272916,super dave,2008-11-28 14:01:00,323,Question for you guys out there who fish jigs.  Have you ever noticed that a large majority of fish that hit pink jigs are male steelhead and majority of fish off white jigs are female??  This is a pattern that I have been noticing for the last few years.  Maybe its just a weird coincidence.
272926,silvio,2008-11-28 14:46:00,433,  I am going to look into this seems very interesting.
272927,dobee,2008-11-28 14:50:00,301,nice fish man!
272937,BillM,2008-11-28 15:09:00,17367,Nice fish Sil!!!  I hit the Notty yesterday for an hour or 2 and came up with nada!
272949,super dave,2008-11-28 15:36:00,323,Same with Black.    I tend to catch a lot more males with black jigs and buggers.
272950,silvio,2008-11-28 15:39:00,433, Lol Bill next year all show you the lower notty. Wish I spent more time fishing it this year.
272952,BillM,2008-11-28 15:40:00,17367,I think I am going to cut my losses and hit the lower the next time I go out!
272954,silvio,2008-11-28 15:45:00,433,The lower is extremely hit or miss... Its very big water with nothing to stop these fish from migrating upstream but its worth a try. My buddy who lives up there is going to pm me with what the northern tribs are like he's been doing well up there. I might make the trip up this weekend if time allows me too.
