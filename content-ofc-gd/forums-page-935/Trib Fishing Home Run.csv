272806,solopaddler,2008-11-28 00:38:00,8605,"Another short but sweet report. (my body is fading fast  )  Fished today with my friend Paul (Paulus on the board). We've been steelheading together for years but rarely get out together anymore because of distance and family obligations.  What a blast we had today putting a lot of miles on the truck in search of fish! While we didn't set the world on fire anywhere we did manage to scratch out a few fish at each location.  First trib:      Paul used the ""low down and dirty"" technique to put this nice little fish on the bank:        I managed to get in the act  :      Things were surprisingly slow so it was off to trib #2  Upon arrival I tied on a white jig and managed to subdue this brute of a male brown!    That was it for me, but no complaints. Paul hit a couple of fish but those shots are on his camera...  Trib #3 should be easily recognizable  . Time was getting short when we arrived with only maybe an hour of light left.. Still we managed a few.  Paul got in the act first with a couple of brownies:        Then it was my turn:      It was a pretty decent day and as always a lot of fun with Paul.  'Till next time bud!  Cheers,  Mike"

272812,ironstone74,2008-11-28 00:48:00,201,Well done as always Solo!  That's some nice side pressure exhibited by your pal.  Paul
272813,Beats,2008-11-28 00:52:00,543,Great fishing once again!  I really like that first shot in the post.  Looks like a really cool area.
272814,highdrifter,2008-11-28 00:52:00,2534,"Nice!  That ""low down and dirty technique"" was perfected by the frenchies doncha know..  Dat's how we pick up dem french girls at de truck rodeos...  Good job boys!  HD"
272820,dobee,2008-11-28 01:07:00,301,nice fish solo!
272826,jdmls,2008-11-28 01:16:00,575,"awesome pics and report Mike   ... Looking at the first picture, I don't think I could fish there..more like just stare at those huge falls with a chub , LOL !! so amazing !!!!... No idea you could fish that stretch of the _ _ _ _ _ _..... the ditches are killing me, I need to get out west more"
272830,silvio,2008-11-28 01:42:00,433,Nice pics bud good to hear you guy's had a good day.
272832,drwxr,2008-11-28 01:46:00,453,"after ""part two"" this is a little slim   but hey, at least you got out sometimes its not about the number and size of the fish but the beauty of the pictures. good job though."

272844,wallacio,2008-11-28 02:21:00,475,Nice work guys - a few miles today indeed.  I'm surprised location #1 was slow - water looked absolutely perfect and there's been some good reports of big fish as of late.
272856,Paulus,2008-11-28 03:07:00,522,"Wow, Solo, you're fast!  I might as well follow suit & offer my contribution for today  As the Solo man stated, things were surprisingly slow for us at trib #1. Although some anglers seemed to be doing ok, there were far fewer fresh fish (say that 4 times fast...) than we expected. Most of the fish that we saw caught had been in the river at least a couple of days, and the ""low and dirty"" one I caught has been there much longer than that.  For me, it was still worth the day off work, for the very good reason that Solo mentions: we don't get out that often anymore. We laughed most of the day, caught up with eachother and as usual had a great time.  Finally, because we worked strategically closer to home, trib 3 obviously being the closest for both of us, both daddies were home in time to spend time with our ""family obligations"" before these where bathed and whisked off to bed  Anyhow, without further ado:  trib #1    Solo's fish at trib #1     trib #2  Solopaddler himself in an epic battle with that large brown trout...    Show-off shot of the victorious result...    Pic of one of mine from the same trib ....    Solo didn't brag that we were essentially the only ones catching fish, when we arrived at this trib. But that changed once the other guys saw the jigs  ... so it turned out to be a community effort.   trib #3  One of the ones I caught. In fact my final fish of the day.    And something she dropped....     Thanks again for another great day, Mike. And thanks for doing all the driving, as usual. Next time, it's my turn to drive... see you in.... April ???  p.-"
