Our celebration runs  the whole month of December, and food, in a Finnish home, is central to the festivities.  Today, I spent 5 hours cranking out Swedish meatballs. They'll be heavenly once they've soaked in Lingonberries and wine.  Next will be Pulla, ginger snaps, cardamom cookies, etc..  We don't do Lutefisk (blechhh!). Don't have too much time to get ready for an open house and fish fry. Not quite the same as my Gram's traditional Finnish open house, but good enough."

273161,bigugli,2008-11-29 02:04:00,6138,My days of hunting are long time done. Sold the Enfield and bird gun years ago.
273165,SBCregal,2008-11-29 02:22:00,688,oh man.... i can remember the pulla and the ginger cookies my grandmother used to make.  i havent had that stuff in years. do you happen to have recipes for those? it'd be killer to try and make some and suprise my mother when we go over there during the holidays.  ryan
273168,bigugli,2008-11-29 02:38:00,6138,"Easiest way too this. I'm still using my Gram's old Five Roses Cookbook with her notes.  Get a 5 Roses book. Use the basic sweet dough recipe. Replace the lemon rind with 3tsp ground cardamom. Best I can say is that the reipe is only a guide. There is a texture and feel to the dough when kneading that tells you its right. Dough needs to feel smooth and has a light satinny texture and no longer stick to your fingers as you work it. You will also find the basic rolled cookie recipes there. Make cardamom cookies by using cardamom, not ginger. Can't help you with the cookie designs. I still use Grams cutters."
273193,Leecher,2008-11-29 03:25:00,7832," Bruce, too bad for selling the rifle and shotgun..... I own a Lee Enfield modified stock and a Baikail one shot 12 gage for birds.... Love those two..... it's my pride and joy I've sold all my guns before because of a bad experience and regret it but now will keep them for as long as I live  but to get back on topic.... think pink, just before hitting the pan with ash browns..... here it is    I know.... me bad"
