272777,misfish,2008-11-27 23:46:00,29133," AH NEVER MIND. . Ah, on second thought, Nope,ya aint worth it..  Maybe ask the MNR what they do to dogs that chase????????????? Oh wait,that question has already been answered here."
272778,misfish,2008-11-27 23:48:00,29133,"Yep. Like I said,I got my answer. Later Dan. I,ll be calling."
272779,irishfield,2008-11-27 23:48:00,26272,"If we could just get this much interest in fishing posts that guys have spent hours compiling, downsizing pics and uploading !"

272784,misfish,2008-11-27 23:57:00,29133,"Kinda figured that,but I couldnt resist.Just a fun dig at ya bud. I had a good rant going,then well like I said......................Nope,ya aint worth it..LOL DELETE."

272569,Walshskie,2008-11-27 15:51:00,58,"I spent 2 summers guiding out Kesagami it 95 miles north of Cochrane and every year it was the same thing by middle summer the camp was over run with jack rabbits they were everywhere it was nothing to see a train of 10 chasing each other, then the wolves would show up early to mid Aug, you would never see them or hear them the rabbit population just would get smaller, you ask how did we know it was wolves the, its the answer to the old joke it does s**t in the woods.  We had every thing up there and the only thing that made me nervous was the bears sometimes they would come into camp at night they were around the dump and some times would show up for shore lunch."
272585,Greencoachdog,2008-11-27 17:01:00,8163," I could really see that happening if there was a fresh kill in the area.     Then he would learn a lifes lesson... wouldn't he?  and his chances of getting lost and dying of exposure and dehydration are greater than being attacked by a pack of wild dogs... I mean rilly, when was the last time you heard of anyone being attacked and killed by a pack of wild dogs?  Some may say the same about you."
272589,Silo Buster,2008-11-27 17:23:00,81,"Quite often when I'm plowing down our crop stubble Coyotes will follow me catching mice or moles as the dirt gets turned over.I've had them as close as 30 ft from the tractor.They seem to be eating well as far as I can tell as they look good,healthy coats and good body size.   I've only witnessed this at night...never in the day light.      If I have to get out of the tractor to make an adjustment to the plow it can be a little nervee"

272634,misfish,2008-11-27 19:07:00,29133,"   BTW happy bird day to ya Dawg. Im sure I,ll catch up to you in the festive drinks.HAHAHAHAHAHAHA   I had my conversation with the CO via cell phone. There have been reports from other farmers in the area. With the load of snow that has dropped, getting out to take care of this problem has been hard also thier limited man power. I was told if I was to shoot one,throw it in the truck and call them. The area farmers have been told to shoot them.  That should solve this issue."
272644,danbo,2008-11-27 19:22:00,2646,Atta Boy!!!
272699,snag,2008-11-27 21:38:00,1932,I've eaten dog when I was in Vietnam.  I got accustomed to it  Not bad.  Anything ground up with garlic is palatable.   Anything.....
272724,misfish,2008-11-27 22:17:00,29133," Yep. Same can be said about horse too. If you dont know what yer eating,it,s all good I say."
272730,ch312,2008-11-27 22:32:00,1590," bahahaha! 5ft at the shoulder eh? if you can get some proof of that, ill sign over my house and truck  wild dogs and coydogs are a real problem and should be shot on site, along with dogs running deer (obviously not hunting dogs), or dogs without a collar that look to be in rough shape.  the last one i nailed was with my crossbow at 35 yards or so  the old neighbours have a daughter that has been working for the mnr for 10+ years. she, along with most CO's, recommend shooting proven feral dogs and ALL cats that are seen in the bush. they'd love to publish this in the regs but you can imagine all the crap they'd hear from tree huggers.  hunters are conservationists. therefore its our duty to protect wildlife from cats and dogs"
272735,misfish,2008-11-27 22:37:00,29133, Was wondering when you would say something.
272251,jwl,2008-11-26 19:47:00,1056,"I been reading this thread a bit and some great points from all.....living in the Niagara region all my life, spending tonnes of time outdoors, I also know some avid hunters.  The ""wild dog"" problem around this area is not unique but a wierd scenario all together, and some areas are ""infested with them"" it has been going on for decades and only getting worse.....forst cases where in about the early 80's when some wolves made thier way down the Bruce Trail from the Tobermory area into the Firemen's Park area of Niagara Falls...they have over years, interbred with the coyotes of the area and also ferril dogs as well, this creating a pretty mixed up breed of thier own...some call them coydogs, others coywolves...the problem with these ones is because of being interbred with wolves they tend to be large animals, they have the cunning nature of a coyote, but interbred with domestic dogs so they have a greatly reduced natural fear of man.  They will even go so far as to basically try and ""kidnap"" other dogs and make them part of thier pack....there is actually quite the problem and high populations in the Welland,Thorold,Niagara area...these ones definately aren't your average coyote, I have seen plenty of those around here, and have seen a couple wolves before around the area where my trailer is....I am an animal lover and conservationist at heart, but if faced with a desision to make about my own saftey atthe time,I don't think I would have a problem popping one off"
272252,misfish,2008-11-26 19:49:00,29133," I talked to the owner today at work. He said to get rid of them. He has two cows on the mend right now from thier attacks. I will be contacting the MNR and see what my right is and options.  One thing has got me confussed. With the amount of deer tracks I seen yesturday,these dogs must not be getting them,but I have noticed this year the lack of red squires and turkeys this fall.  A while back I also mentioned I seen a fisher. Maybe one of them will take out the other.?????????  Lew no worries about stirring,we know you better then that.   Hey Dan,as for STATS,I dont want to be a statistic,so if they come close,they get it."
272267,Nemo,2008-11-26 20:15:00,727,"Physical characteristics Gray wolf weight and size can vary greatly worldwide, tending to increase proportionally with latitude as predicted by Bergmann's Rule. In general, height varies from 0.6 to .95 meters (26â€“38 inches) at the shoulder and weight typically ranges from 20 (44 lb.) up to 68 (150 lb.) kilograms, which together make the gray wolf the largest of all wild canids.[5] Although rarely encountered, extreme specimens of more than 77 kg (170 lb.) have been recorded in Alaska, Canada,[6] and the former Soviet Union.[7] The heaviest gray wolf recorded in the New World was killed on 70 Mile River in east central Alaska on July 12, 1939 and weighed 79 kg (175 lb.),[8] while the heaviest wolf recorded in the Old World was killed after World War II in the kobelyakski Area of the Poltavskij Region in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and weighed 86 kg (189 lb.).[7]   Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf"
272269,TennesseeGuy,2008-11-26 20:21:00,957,"A little off topic, but I have a customer who has a 75% wolf and at my request he brought her into my office a couple of times.  She is a really nice pet.  Another guy has two wolves of about the same mixture that are kept caged and they are pretty wild.  I wouldn't try touching or feeding them."
272274,cram,2008-11-26 20:43:00,1733, Interesting stuff.  I remember seeing one that someone had and it was very nice but very very skittish.  Not sure if it was because of its DNA or just how it was raised.
272276,lew,2008-11-26 20:50:00,12767,"Not to take this excellent thread too far off topic, but I've had a house trailer up near Peterboro for the last 34 years and we always heard coyotes in the fields behind us, usually very early in the morning before sunrise.  About 10 years ago they suddenly disappeared and we never heard them again until this past summer when they returned full strength and we now often hear them howling again.  Were over run with deer up there now and I'm thinking perhaps that's what's drawing them back again.......bring your gun up Brian, you could have a deer field day  I hafta admit though, it's kinda nice to be sitting on the deck at 3:00 AM, sipping on the mornings 1st coffee, and listening to mother nature in all her wonderful glory !!!!"
272278,cram,2008-11-26 20:58:00,1733,"  I agree -- love hearing them at night.  Though i think the ones i hear are wolves (near algonquin).  Did walk between what i assume was 2 packs of coyotes yipping to each other earlier this fall.  Weird, but neat."
272279,misfish,2008-11-26 21:03:00,29133, Very cool indeed Lew. You did mean at 6 am though didnt you? LOL
272283,lew,2008-11-26 21:12:00,12767," Sheesh Brian, by 6 am I'm already back from fish'n  and ready for lunch"
272285,misfish,2008-11-26 21:18:00,29133, Yeah I know Lew. LOL
272026,oxcowboy,2008-11-26 03:13:00,544,"the way i see it is that there is no good gonna come from a wild dog, no fear of man + animal instinct= bad combination.  when i was a child i  got put up a tree by  a couple, scared the living crap out of me!  kill em all.  jason"
272034,Fisherman,2008-11-26 03:27:00,7201,"Okay, now I know for sure you guys are growing something wacky up there...4 feet I can believe if I drink a six pack, but 5 feet, there ain't nuff beer in TBay to make that happen.    The last lion I saw wasn't no where near that big."
272044,danc,2008-11-26 03:55:00,4677, Read my post before your next 6 pack.
272045,Dozer,2008-11-26 03:57:00,896,"lol, this is quite the comical read  This wild dog business is news to me, and I thaught I knew a bit about the Canadian wilderness."
272047,danc,2008-11-26 04:02:00,4677," Watch out Dozer. They're out there and they'll track you down and rip you to shreds before you know what happened. The closer to Toronto that you live, the more likely that you'll get attacked.  Lions and Tigers and Bears. Oh my...."
272051,GBW,2008-11-26 04:17:00,8460,Brian *click* is all I've got to say and I've had dogs around me my whole life.  When in doubt - Charlie out. to bad the Inn is gone in town eh?   :D I bet you know my bro-in-law if you live there as it's such a close town and he's been there for many years.
272054,danbo,2008-11-26 04:20:00,2646,http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news...2b7&k=65917  This is for you know-it-alls!
272055,Fisherman,2008-11-26 04:21:00,7201,"Okay, I re read it, it seems that you say that some (wovles) are 4-5 feet tall at the shoulders, to me that means when it's standing on its 4 legs, it would measure 4-5' high at the shoulder, or do you mean if it stands on its hind legs, front paws up, it would be 4-5 feet high?"
272059,GBW,2008-11-26 04:28:00,8460,I gather he means on 2 legs rather then 4 as my 80LB LAB is 4' to 5' when she is up on 2 legs.

272061,steverowbotham,2008-11-26 04:30:00,1800,lol comical and absurd
272062,irishfield,2008-11-26 04:32:00,26272,Brian... you still hiding under the bed... ???
272064,Dozer,2008-11-26 04:41:00,896,"Well, wolves can get pretty damn big.  Some wolves from ""northern"" regions grow to over 150 lbs!  ...and in terms of ""wolf attacks"", theres been a few reported.  If my mind serves me right, in North America there has been no deaths by wolves, or possibly only 1 which isn't even confirmed being a wolf.  Wolves are dope!"
272066,cram,2008-11-26 04:50:00,1733, I understand the fear of a bunch of dogs running at you....i would be scared as well.  At that moment.  No idea about wild dogs.  Your example is from a native reserve near in a very barren area where a pack of starving dogs attacked a child.  Not sure its the same....but like i said -- know nothing about wild dogs.  My point is -- no one should be afraid of wolves.  This isn't a Jack London book.  But again -- if i were the original poster i'd have been alarmed as well.
272070,danc,2008-11-26 05:32:00,4677, 4 to 5 feet tall at the shoulder. Just curious here. How tall at the shoulder would the highest wolf be that you've seen on the Hudson Bay shore?
272073,Dozer,2008-11-26 05:50:00,896,Before or after the 6 pack?
272090,Fisherman,2008-11-26 13:05:00,7201,"Haven't been to Hudson Bay this weeks, just can't fit it into my schedule   , but, we do have some wolves in our range area, definitely no more than 26-28"" high at the shoulder on 4 feet. A little more research puts the average at 36"" with the odd rare one a little bigger.  With that, I'm letting this one die out."
272098,cityfisher,2008-11-26 13:31:00,959,If they were CoyDogs or yotes. i would of shot them since your Deer hunt is pretty much over.  Is there still a Shotgun hunt open this time of year? I thought that area only had an early NOV hunt and a early Dec Muzzleloader...everything else is BOW.
272117,misfish,2008-11-26 14:21:00,29133," First week of Dec is the shotgun hunt buck only.   No Wayne,betty took me by the hand and told me everything would be ok.    Well I guess ya,ll just had to be there in me boots to see this.   Alex,I,ll take the 3 S,s for 1000 please.  Just curious,how many of you that responded,hunt?  Thanks for your input."
272122,bigugli,2008-11-26 14:28:00,6138," Used to hunt, but that was a long time ago.  A wolf 5' at the shoulder would be the size of a gnarly old bruin."
272161,PAZE,2008-11-26 15:34:00,132," I think your talking coyotes, a wolf is massive, unless you have seen a REAL wolf in the wild you wont understand how big they can get, and the farther north you go the bigger they are, a wolf pelt from the tip of his nose to his tail can reach 10-12 feet, they are alot bigger then you think."
272170,DANIMAL,2008-11-26 15:44:00,215, The exact same thing happend to me last winter. I was alone with only a hachet for a weapon so I got out of there as quick as I could. I talked to some people about it afterwards and was told that farm dogs get into large packs at night and take down large animals for sport. That sent a shiver down my spine.
272174,anders,2008-11-26 15:58:00,1168,I do know wolves can get big...a lot bigger than an 80 lb dog.   4-5 feet at the shoulder for a wolf...no problem.  Actually....there was a wolf attack at Kathryns Cove just south of here a few summers ago.  Tests were done and the animal was sick.  That was a big wolf too.
272176,danbo,2008-11-26 16:01:00,2646,http://www.sundownoutfitters.com/images/monster_wolf.jpg   (Do you guys argue for a hobby?)
272181,cram,2008-11-26 16:14:00,1733," I don't, but spend a LOT of time backwoods camping (with wolves remarkably close by one time this fall) and wolves have never been a concern.  And never will.   There are lots at my parents place up north as well....coming out of algonquin park.  Never ever a concern except for the nearby farmers who lose some livestock.  Dog packs - I have heard stories about them killing animals for fun (versus eating, which is what wolves do) but have never heard of htem hunting down a person.   But, i don't know that it doesn't happen.  Killing coyotes because you're deer hunting sounds just dumb to me.  Really dumb."
272009,cram,2008-11-26 02:44:00,1733,"Curious -- how many cases have there been of people getting attacked by wolves in ontario?  How about packs of dogs?  Does it even happen? I mean, come on...."
272011,danc,2008-11-26 02:47:00,4677, Another misleading example. Do some research of Wolf attacks on man. I'll save you the time. There are none to make it worth your while. I've been within 50 feet of a pack of wolves daily for a few months near Hudson Bay. A few were 4 to 5 feet tall at the shoulders. Beautiful animals. Kill a beautiful animal for what reason? Wish I had a camera back then.
