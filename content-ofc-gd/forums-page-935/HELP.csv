216431,splashhopper,2008-06-17 13:52:00,2931,"rickster.. another chatter here > CCMT<< guided me to a site called www.photobucket.com  very easy to use once u set up a FREE account on it.  get the account set up  upload a few pics right now...  then click on the box BELOW the pic titled >> IMG Code<<< that u want to bring to this site (this creates a ""copy"" of the link  come back to this post right now and try it like this>>>    Good luck Splashhopper"
216432,ccmtcanada,2008-06-17 13:57:00,7971,"Yep...this might help a little more....  After you have uploaded your pic to photobucket, click on the box that is outlined below....   Then simply paste that link into your report (on your keyboard, press the Ctrl and ""V"" at the same time)   The image will show up....be sure to preview before you post to make sure it worked.  Good luck!"

273085,Leecher,2008-11-28 23:15:00,7832," Thanks Clifff for posting this tutorial, had the same issue when I posted my buck but no more..... photobucket is so simple and it even reduce your photos for you..... just got to preset some upload options and voila.... and like you said, make sure that you preview before submitting, that way you will see the end results.

273144,Bernie,2008-11-29 01:21:00,3190,He can't tell you Brian. It's Canadian Tire top secret technology
273171,ccmtcanada,2008-11-29 02:46:00,7971,"Brian...they are just screen shots.  I hit the ""prt scr"" button on my keyboard, then paste it in my photo editor.  My photo editor does that box highlight thing when I drag the mouse.   Hit print screen again, open again, and then save.  Kind of a pain in the butt, but works well to explain stuff online...."
273176,Bernie,2008-11-29 02:54:00,3190, It is cool Cliff. Never thought of that. Thanks.
273181,douG,2008-11-29 03:10:00,2693,"You can use the same trick to post any picture that you find on teh interwebs.  What Photobucket does for you is to bracket the url or address of your photo in 'img' tags.  Look again at Cliff ccmt's example.  You see .  So, to post a picture that you find on the web , right click on it, and select properties.  Then you can see the url of your photo.  Copy that, and then paste it into your post, with the 'img' tags described above.  This lets you do stuff like this:    That's a hunk o meteorite btw.  Mebbe even your browser will call the address of your picture its 'location' and provide you the option to copy that location.  That makes it even more easier, also."
273192,Bernie,2008-11-29 03:25:00,3190,"Testing testing  1,2,3  Hey... It works! Ha. Learn something new everyday Thanks! Now I wont need to add everything on to  P-bucket to post. "
273212,douG,2008-11-29 03:56:00,2693,"Hey, it's easy 'n' it's fun!"
273213,SNAGKING,2008-11-29 03:59:00,43,testing  
273215,Bernie,2008-11-29 04:03:00,3190, Yep. Something new douG. Should have it figured out by spring.
273219,douG,2008-11-29 04:54:00,2693,"Take care when you post the url.  If it has a '?' in it, it might not work, throwing a message saying that dynamic urls are not allowed.  Then you are back to the above, saving the image to your pc, and uploading it to Photobucket or OFC or Flickr or others."
