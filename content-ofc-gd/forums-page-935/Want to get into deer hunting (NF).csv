I have always wanted to get into deer hunting and have finally decided to not wait any longer.  I know nothing...I mean nothing.  I don't have my hunter training or even a gun yet, but I will get there.  The biggest problem I have is that I don't know anyone who hunts deer who can show me the ropes (hunting, meat prep, etc., etc.).  Can you offer some suggestions on what I can do to educate myself to get into this sport and be successful at it?  If it helps, I live near Hamilton.  Thanks for your input."

Then try to find out if there are any hunting clubs (sportsman clubs) in your area. and find out about joining one of them, you'll get to meet a lot of people with all sorts of experience, it might take you a while to earn their confidance but if you are a stand up guy, that will come.  Read a lot, go talk to a local butcher, try to find someone that knows how to make saussage, jerky, summer saussage, offer to work for them part time in exchange for teaching you about meat etc..  Talk to other hunters, actually, listen to other hunters especially the ones that tend to be successful. Spend a lot of time in the bush listening and watching."

Here are few links of sites to which I am a member of and they are always welcoming new members with questions. I love the fact that you are wanting to learn to hunt, a lot of hunters have been members in camps for many years so new fresh blood is not always welcome until you gain experience and trust.  Good luck and here are some good local forums: http://www.ontariotrophybucks.com/ http://www.huntontario.com/ http://ontariohunter.proboards26.com/index.cgi"
