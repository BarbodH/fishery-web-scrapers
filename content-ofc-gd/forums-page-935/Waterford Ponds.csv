272493,Stern Rules,2008-11-27 08:05:00,342,Has anyone ever ice fished the Waterford Ponds? Eric or Richard would know. Would appreciate any info. Might give it a try this year.
272520,Rich,2008-11-27 13:29:00,3927,"It's a very popular place for ice fishermen, and to this day I have no idea why. Had some good days on hammer handle pike in some spots, but other than that it's usually a slow fishing spot. Makes sense. Make a little pond look like swiss cheese and the fish are bound to get lockjawed.  You're better off ice fishing the bay IMO."
272524,ScarSnake,2008-11-27 13:45:00,20,"When I was a kid, we caught a rainbow, a perch, and about 50 crappies ice fishing there once. Great fun! But that was probably 30 years ago. darn I'm getting old!"
272584,joonmoon,2008-11-27 16:58:00,528,"Like Rich said, great for some small pannies(Bluegils mostly) and small hammerhandle to medium pikies. Haven't seen any crappies there. You can catch the occassional bass and one pond was stocked awhile ago with trout. Good for takin the kids out or if ya just wanna wet a line but I would suggest LPB after it freezes up. Better numbers and size there too."
