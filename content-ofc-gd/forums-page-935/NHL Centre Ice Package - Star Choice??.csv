272536,Smitty1,2008-11-27 14:16:00,29,Hi Guys  I am hoping someone can answer this question regarding the NHL centre ice package.  I am a Leaf fan living in Ottawa - so I ordered this package last night - I am wondering about tonight's game in Ottawa - will it be shown on centre ice or will there be a black out here?  I don't have sportsnet - which I believe it is shown on - anyone know if this will be shown or will I be listening the old fashion way on the radio?  Thanks Smitty

272635,JohnF,2008-11-27 19:09:00,3494," I have Starchoice and I get Sportsnet and TSN alternates. I often get games on them, but there are occasional blackouts too. Look at the numbers just above 400  JF"
272642,JustinHoffman,2008-11-27 19:19:00,482,"Hey Smitty,  I am also a Leaf fan living in the Nation's Capital.  Due to the lack of televised ""blue and white"" games in this area, each year I order the Centre Ice package, although my cable provider is Rogers.  Now, I do have Sportsnet, so watching the game tonight on that channel shouldn't be a problem. However, I would imagine it would also be on Centre Ice, as it is my understanding that all games are shown.  For instance - I watched the last game again Washington on Centre Ice, even though it was only originally broadcast on Leafs TV...  I believe you should get every Leaf game....  Go Leafs Go,  Justin"
