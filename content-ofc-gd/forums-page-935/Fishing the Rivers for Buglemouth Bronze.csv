272023,silvio,2008-11-26 03:05:00,433, I hear you!!
272024,highdrifter,2008-11-26 03:09:00,2534,"KEWL!!  At least when the fishing is slow, you got somethin healthy to munch on..  thanks for the report brah! HD"
272028,Victor,2008-11-26 03:17:00,1609,"Looks like a great day Rich! That looks like a real nice spot, have never gone carping at a tiny creek like that before. Wolfville/MJL and I gotta head your way sometime this winter to join ya for some buglemouth bronze!"
272510,Greencoachdog,2008-11-27 12:47:00,8163,"Great ""how to"" report Rich!!!  Some nice Goldfish for ya too!!!  Keep that kinda bait away from Splenda... I'm sure he'd gobble them down in a heartbeat!!!"
272887,jwl,2008-11-28 05:19:00,1056,well that's a pretty cool way to catch pike bait
272900,limeyangler,2008-11-28 12:30:00,5204,Thats great Rich!  I've never even seen a roe bag.....but great idea!   Do you use hair rigs as well? I know that is a common method back in england/europe.
273071,Rich,2008-11-28 22:31:00,3927,"I tinkered with true hair rigs for the first time this year. They do work very well for still fishing. The way I fish however I am drift/sight fishing with the bags. Without actually seeing the carp pick up the bag (especially this time of year) it's very difficult to get a proper hookset, or often even detect the bites. I saw them pick up the bag for a matter of seconds then spit it out without feeling a thing.. and that's with ultra light gear and 6lb test."
273177,hammercarp,2008-11-29 03:02:00,964,Have you tried float fishing them?
273495,Rich,2008-11-30 02:30:00,3927,"With limited success, yes.  It seems that they'll only move up to hit a 1"" grub or live worm below the float. The ones that hit corn only seem to hit it if the hook hits bottom and stays put for a few seconds.  I think I have a video of me using the float gear and landing a carp last fall.  I tried a few times in the summer as well, but at that time you can't float anything past all the chub minnows and brown trout."
271819,Rich,2008-11-25 20:44:00,3927,"Here's every bit of info you need to hit the ""tribs"" and come out on top for buglemouth bronze.  First off, tie yourself up some maple/cherry cured corn bags.    Next, find yourself a nice looking creek.    Walk the creek until you find a logjam. If today is any indication, behind every logjam or slow spot there will be 5000 bronze nosers. Unfortunately they won't be big, and the first one won't fight in the slightest.    Luckily, you'll find a deeper, wider section and hook into a scrappier one that will give you a run for your money.      Don't be surprised when you catch a bunch of these little guys in the process as well.    And there you have it. 1 hour well spent!  Was certainly nice to go take advantage of this ""warm"" spell.. good to be out without snow on the ground. Though my spider sense tells me that won't last long."
271822,snag,2008-11-25 20:49:00,1932,"Interesting Rich,  I never fish for carp but that tied corn looks like it would reduce the Gobie attacks.  Might have to drag my neice and nephews out to give that a try.  Thanks"
271824,JohnF,2008-11-25 20:54:00,3494, When I first saw that pic I thought you'd pulled out somebody's teeth.  JF
271829,hammercarp,2008-11-25 21:06:00,964,"That is cool. Thanks for the great write up. One more way to enjoy carpin. Is that just a couple of split shot about 16"" from the hook?"
271833,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-25 21:15:00,2050,"lol dude that's genius....well...well maybe genius is a little over the top, but I can't believe I never thought to tie my corn in roe bags!  I think I spend more time trying to get my corn to stay on my hooks than I do catching fish.  I'll have to give that a go!  thanks for the report Rich - I'm IIIIIITCHIN' to get out of the office - it's been a long week and it's only wednesday...  cheers, UF"
271837,snag,2008-11-25 21:27:00,1932," Um,  Try Tuesday  Sorry man"
271843,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-25 21:31:00,2050, oh man - That REALLY sucks   ....thanks for nothin' Snag.....on the bright side I'm not as far behind as I thought I was.
271845,kemper,2008-11-25 21:43:00,2232,"Rich, what type of creek are you finding these carp in? I know that I have seen VERY FEW carp on the steelhead rivers and the likes. Are these creeks leading into the big lake? or are they smaller cottage lake type streams?"
271852,cram,2008-11-25 22:02:00,1733,"Thanks for putting this thread together.  I would LOVE to try carp fishing.  Have tried in the spring - see them busting up the bullrushes, but assume they're spawning and not interested in eating.  Any recommendations as to where?   Creeks i  might try this in?  Curing the corn -- how?"
271854,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-25 22:28:00,2050," Not tryign to highjack anything from Rich, but I live near Long Point and frequent the creeks and tribs that run into the bay and they're all stacked with pint sized carp.  Fun on light tackle... I read that Big Creek used to run into the main lake rather than the bay and back then the steelhead run was much better....who knows...all I know is the steelie run either sucks or I suck at fishing them! lol Bring on the buglenose bronze I guess.  cheers, UF"
271855,Rich,2008-11-25 22:30:00,3927,"This creek, after several dams eventually leads into Lake Erie. The lower reaches are actually quite big, I can take my boat up about 3-4 km from the lake.  It's an urban community. I was actually going to take pictures of the picturesque setting leading to the spot.. Wendy's, Tim Hortons, Shopper's Drug Mart.. lol  Any shallow, warm or slow running creek with a mud bottom is a good start. I know a few spots that don't usually freeze in the winter that hold carp like this one. I just fish this one because it's a couple blocks from my house.  As for curing the corn cram.. I take frozen no name corn, boil a couple handfuls in cherry Kool-Aid (or whatever flavour you want, they all seem to work) then add syrup to the container of bags."
271859,cram,2008-11-25 22:41:00,1733,"Thank you -- will try it for sure.  Maybe a dumb question, but what are they doing up iin the creeks?  I thought they spawned in marshy areas  Chris"
271867,Rich,2008-11-25 22:53:00,3927,"They run up rivers to spawn as well, these fish aren't spawning though. They're residents of the creek year round. I can catch them (more actually) in the spring and summer but never find the time as I'm always busy chasing other species."
271869,silvio,2008-11-25 23:00:00,433,You must be really bored... You should be fishing steelhead not carp in tribs man.
271872,solopaddler,2008-11-25 23:12:00,8605," Sorry bud, but don't agree. Fishing is fishing it's all good.  Yeah I do a lot of steelheading but I'm not fond of being labled a steelheader. Don't like to be pidgeonholed like that, I'm an angler.  Versatilty is the mark of a great angler. One fish isn't any more worthy than another.   (Nice post Rich)"
271873,kemper,2008-11-25 23:15:00,2232," Cool, thanks Rich   Never have I been a carp fisher...but I bet they would be hella fun on the twelve six float rod and pin!"
271880,ccmtcanada,2008-11-25 23:28:00,7971,Great report Rich!!!  A fish is a fish....and I love to target those guys as well.
271883,cram,2008-11-25 23:31:00,1733," Say that in england.  Besides, if steelhead is anything like salmon fishing (shoulder to shoulder with a billion other guys) then i disagree.  Love the fish...hate the crowds."
271888,Rich,2008-11-25 23:37:00,3927,Would have been steelheading if I could have been! Been itchin' to hit the tribs since the temps dropped. Unfortunately I couldn't get there today so this had to do.
271899,tibbs,2008-11-25 23:50:00,650,Lol!  Looks like a blast!
271905,silvio,2008-11-25 23:57:00,433," Don’t get me wrong fishing is fishing like Mike said and being able to catch multiple species is what makes up a good angler. I know rich fishes steel and meant it as a joke not to offend. Rich any time on the water is better then time at work we all know weather you catching bass, carp, suckers, walleye, steelhead it’s just good to be in the outdoors."
271906,silvio,2008-11-26 00:01:00,433, Cram carp are a great fish to target and I fish for them every now and then they have tons of power and are fun to catch. Steelhead fishing has less crowds then salmon fishing usually. Like I said meant it more like a joke then to offend anyone.
271938,bigugli,2008-11-26 00:58:00,6138,Amen brother
271944,Rich,2008-11-26 01:08:00,3927," 'eh Silvio didn't offend me a bit! This time of year it's hard to top the fight of a fresh chromer. Carp are the closest thing I got, so unfortunately they take up my winter river time more than anything else. I'm just thankful I have a spot to fish so close to home."
271961,Leecher,2008-11-26 01:39:00,7832,Great report and pics Rich  That was a very educational report.... Great job man and thanks for sharing Leechman
