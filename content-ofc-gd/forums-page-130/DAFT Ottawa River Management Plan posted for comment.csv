966685,Lunker Larry,2016-04-17 02:09:00,122,"The intent of the Ecological Framework for Recreational Fisheries Management is to manage and monitor fisheries at a larger Fisheries Management Zone (FMZ) scale to provide optimal social, cultural and economic opportunities and values derived through the biologically sustainable use of aquatic resources across FMZs and the province, and to enhance public input and involvement in the fisheries management planning process. As a result, Fisheries Management Advisory Councils that include representation from First Nations, stakeholders, the science community and the public have been established. The intent of the councils is to help the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) develop direction and objectives for the management of fisheries resources. This new direction will help the MNRF to better address fisheries sustainability, evaluate the effectiveness of management actions and address other resource management concerns on a fisheries management zone basis. Fisheries Management Zone 12 (FMZ 12) includes portions of the MNRF administrative districts of Kemptville, Pembroke and North Bay. The fisheries resources of FMZ 12 are used by First Nations, resident anglers and non-resident anglers as well as commercial fishers. They provide important recreational, economic and cultural importance to communities within the zone. Prominent sports fish species within FMZ 12 include walleye, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, channel catfish, and muskellunge. The MNRF, in co-operation with the FMZ 12 Advisory Council, have developed a range of fisheries management objectives and strategies, which will be specific to maintaining fisheries within the unique ecological and social features of FMZ 12. These objectives and strategies form the basis of the draft Fisheries Management Plan which is being presented to the public for review and consultation prior to preparation of a final plan. The FMZ 12 plan for the Ottawa River does not contain any regulation changes, all regulation changes on the Ottawa River were made prior to the establishment of the FMZ 12 Advisory Council as part of a regulation harmonization project with Quebec. The information collected during the planning process for the Fisheries Management Zone 12 Fisheries Management Plan will be used by the public, the private sector, municipalities and government agencies to help guide future management of fisheries and aquatic resources to ensure the sustainability of the aquatic ecosystems in FMZ 12  This proposal has been posted for a 45 day public review and comment period starting April 15, 2016. If you have any questions, or would like to submit your comments, please do so by May 30, 2016 to the individual listed under ""Contact"". Additionally, you may submit your comments on-line. All comments received prior to May 30, 2016 will be considered as part of the decision-making process by the Ministry if they are submitted in writing or electronically using the form provided in this notice and reference EBR Registry number 012-6583. Please Note: All comments and submissions received will become part of the public record. Comments received as part of the public participation process for this proposal will be considered by the decision maker for this proposal."

I have noticed first hand the abundance of juvenile walleye and Sauger and an apparent lack of larger walleye on the northern stretch of the river, and I hope to see the regs a little more strict in the next few years.  5 fish with no slot simply doesn't work on a fishery with that much pressure.  That said, it's still an amazing, prolific system"
