967259,Jon,2016-04-22 12:48:00,209,I heard from MNRF that Bronte Creek will be lampricided by staff from the Sea Lamprey Control Centre (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) on Sunday. I'm not sure exactly when (e.g. early or late Sunday) or where the treatment will be taking place but thought it would be of interest to those heading out this weekend.  Jon
