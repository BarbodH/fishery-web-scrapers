967273,acplumber,2016-04-22 14:52:00,28,Hi I'll be staying on the river this weekend and want to take my kids out a few times when we are up there. We will be inbetween Durham and Hanover. What do you think a good lure/bait/tactic would be for trout. We will have our spinning rods with us Thx
967274,AKRISONER,2016-04-22 14:53:00,5558,"float a worm, especially with kids"
967281,BillM,2016-04-22 15:22:00,17367,"Small spoons, spinners, stick baits, etc.   Might run into a resident brown or two."
967313,netminder,2016-04-22 17:35:00,514,"There are many places in the Durham area that stock speckled trout. It may be a bit of a zoo between the lower and middle dam but if you can bunt your way in there I'd recommend floating a worm or a small spinner with a bit of worm meat on it. The Holstein Mill dam is stocked too, below the dam I believe. Also the Allan Park Pond. If you're looking for ""resident"" browns try the stretch behind the ball diamonds in Durham."

Someone catches a fish it's bedlam getting people to pull in their lines. Then everyone rushed over to that spot. I saw fist fly that day. I might wait a week or so to take the kids there. I know I wouldn't on opening day for sure. It was a Zoo, I don't know about now I bet it's worse."
