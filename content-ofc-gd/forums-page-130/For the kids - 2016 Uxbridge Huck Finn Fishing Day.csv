967112,Tom McCutcheon,2016-04-21 00:28:00,627,"Sorry Cliff, my limited skills on the keyboard haven't been able to provide a link. Brian has it right though. Ducks Unlimited have been doing this for 29 years where they net off about a 1 mile section of the canal under the lift lock and stock it with about 6000 or 7000 specks and rainbows. One fish named Walter usually weighs in at around 10 or 12 pounds. A lot of the fish are tagged for special prizes but just about every one of the 2 to 3 thousand kids under 15 come home with something from the prize stage. We at MCI are just there in a support role. We will have our 20 X 40 foot tent set up for shade or inclement weather and will be assisting the kids build there own lure. It's a great way for us to give something back to the community which has shown so much support for our chapter of MCI over the past number of years. And it's a lot of fun too.... Sorry Dutch, didn't mean to hijack your post. We will now return you to your regular programming...."
