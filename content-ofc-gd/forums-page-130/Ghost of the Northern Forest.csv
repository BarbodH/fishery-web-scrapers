Thought a few of you might enjoy something like this and I know from past posts some members have actually had encounters with these elusive animals . Enjoy

The last one I saw was in the middle of winter as it walked past the end of my driveway.

959943,smitty55,2016-02-27 02:23:00,928,Tks for the heads up. That was a very enjoyable 44 minutes I just watched in hd on my pc. Streamed from cbc for those that missed it. Sure is nice with no commercials. Great show and photography on a rarely seen critter that has always sort of had that mystique about it.  Cheers
