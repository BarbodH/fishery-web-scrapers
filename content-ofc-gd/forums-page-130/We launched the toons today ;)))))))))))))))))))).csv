Before my good friend arrived though, I snapped these this morning,,,,,      Once we got set up, it was ice breaking time,,,,    It was nervey listening to the ice hitting the toon, but we managed. Some guys have to much fun. LOL     We were marking some big fish. We found out what they were,,,,    Great half day spent on the water. My new to me Elite 5X was flawless. I could see it with the shades on and when the sun was hitting it.  Till the next toon outing,  Cheers  B"

966698,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-17 03:53:00,8243,"The first thing that came to mind was how cold were your feetsies? It was 77F yesterday on the deck facing the lake, but I wasn't going to dip my toes in the water.  Can I say it? You're nuts my man. Catch any fish? If you did you earned it. But you're still nuts."
