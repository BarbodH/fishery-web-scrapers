966766,captpierre,2016-04-18 01:08:00,2521,Want to build a 6 inch deep open plywood box to fit on the front of my Honda ATV. I don't want to wreck the powder coated paint on the rack and cause rust. Could use some U bolts and pad things with rubber.  But will have metal up off the inside bottom of the box. Was wondering if I use 6-10 heavy duty zip ties. Would that be strong enough? Might carry stuff like a chainsaw.

966768,richyb,2016-04-18 01:42:00,774,I use bungee chords on mine. hook on box and run it under the rack and hook on other side of box. That way when I'm trapping and happen to hit a tree the box has some give to it and doesnt break.
966769,porkpie,2016-04-18 01:44:00,2521,That's what I do with the wooden box I made for the front of my bike.  Works pretty good.
966771,vance,2016-04-18 02:04:00,719,If you only use it occasionally either will  work BUT they will break and leave you with an unattached box far from home (been there). A little shot of rust check will stop it from rusting..
966776,Fisherman,2016-04-18 10:55:00,7201,"If you extend the sides of the box a bit to fit snugly within the framework of the front rack, then it won't move side to side, front to back.  Then get the ratchet strap with rubber coated hooks to hold it down."
966792,Tom McCutcheon,2016-04-18 13:57:00,627,"you could try what I did. If the carrier frame has the square attachment tubes such as mine, I used 1/2 inch aluminum square stock, bent it into an ""L"" shape and attached the wooden box with bolts and wing nuts. Hasn't moved in 10 years. If I want to take it off, just undo the wing nuts and bolts."
966867,whiskywizard,2016-04-18 23:02:00,305,"If the box isn't secured really well, it will move about and damage your rack's paint.  I suggest u-bolts, with polyvinyl tubing slipped over them, or wrap them in self-consolidating silicone tape. Either will protect the rack and be secure.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/tools-hardware/plumbing/plumbing-parts-fittings/plumbing-parts-fittings/watts-clear-pre-cut-vinyl-tubing-0633265p.html?utm_campaign=bazaarvoice&utm_medium=SearchVoice&utm_source=AskAndAnswer&utm_content=Default  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/fushion-pro-self-fusing-black-silicone-tape-0670023p.html#.VxVnXhMrJE4"
