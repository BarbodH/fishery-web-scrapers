966674,misfish,2016-04-17 00:06:00,29133,Must be warm out. LOL  Nice laker
966706,spincast,2016-04-17 11:07:00,3279,"Healthy looking laker. Lady O? yepper - it was a combat zone off Jordan, so we dodged up towards Grimsby. Not much on the screen. The temps are 42 in close but still 39 and 40 out in the 80 fow and beyond range. need some W winds.  Must be warm out. LOL  Nice laker finally !   here's to spring!"
966714,Freshtrax,2016-04-17 14:12:00,2215,Nice day to be on the lake for sure.   Too bad no silvers.   But beats sitting at home.... Let's hope spring is here to stay and we get the temps back we had at the end of February lol

966740,spincast,2016-04-17 20:53:00,3279,"water was 42 today, and 40 out at 100 FOW, but the mud-lines were mostly gone and you could see bottom in 20 FOW. nothing to show for looking from 20 - 120. A few more warm days combined with west winds and I'm thinking we'll be seeing some action"
