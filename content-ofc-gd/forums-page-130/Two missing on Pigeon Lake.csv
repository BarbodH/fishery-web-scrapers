A few years back while putting my dock in I slipped and fell, I was only in about 3' of water but I still had a hard time getting back on my feet and getting out.

965618,FishFinder17,2016-04-07 15:51:00,139,saw my barber yesterday. He brought up this story because he also cuts the guys hair who was dating one of the girls who passed away in this tragic accident. Said they had been together for 10 years and recently had an argument. They both agreed to patch it up when she got home from the cottage...  So so tragic I cant even put it into words. My thoughts are with all those affected by this.

According to Kawartha Lakes OPP, the body of the 28-year-old woman was recovered from Pigeon Lake on Saturday morning. The discovery comes five days after the OPP ceased search efforts for the woman. Police say the woman and two other people went out on a canoe on April 3 to retrieve a pedal boat that had drifted away from shore. One person was able to successfully make it back to shore after the canoe capsized. The body of a 23-year-old Scarborough man was recovered from the lake on April 5. Police say none of the canoe occupants had life-jackets on."

965243,kickingfrog,2016-04-04 21:52:00,8333,Sad and frustrating.
965269,boombap,2016-04-05 00:20:00,310,I never wear a PFD when I'm out on the boat  Then I hear stories like this and second guess myself.

Mind you...you see the paddle boat drifting...seems so innocent. You don't really think about it, probably only going a couple hundred feet. I can totally understand why someone would just head on out and try to retrieve it"
965277,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-05 01:03:00,10439,"I don't generally wear mine in the boat but always do when in my kayak, or one man pontoons."
965286,GBW,2016-04-05 01:53:00,8460,With warm water temps I'm guilty of not wearing mine in my boat as well.  But the second I'm in another person's boat you bet I am.  Not due to trust issues but my boat is a bowrider and when I'm in others its a bass boat so it's easier to have things happen at a higher rate of speed and lower profile. Sad day for those involved...

Wet suit or much better, a drysuit, but not everyone will have or can afford either. With the water temps in the spring, they would have succumbed to hypothermia imo unless they didn't panic. Which is what happens when people hit very cold water very suddenly.  I hope they find them so there's closure for the families."

965296,farsider,2016-04-05 02:51:00,456,"For a bare minimum, a pfd would save the families more grief as the ""search"" would be over quicker.  Spare the rescuers and ""recovery"" teams as well.  Beside affording you a longer window for rescue of course.  I always think of not me falling into the water but, being hit by an out of control Jetski or Wake boarder.  Cheers, Mark"

Which is what happens when people hit very cold water very suddenly.  I hope they find them so there's closure for the families.  You are very correct. Back in the early 90's my buddy and I were fishing the St. Kitts spring derby and another boat had issues with their motor in 4-6 footers. They took 2 waves over the stern and went down, but they got a mayday call out on the radio. There were quite a few boats out and help was there very quickly. The guys in the boat were in the water hanging on to their semi submerged boat and told the rescuers they were just about ready to let go due to the cold water. This was after less than 1 minute in the cold spring water.  They all survived and were all sporting bran new survival suits the next week."
965300,manitoubass2,2016-04-05 03:40:00,11391, Not familiar with the lake though so you may indeed be correct
965304,fishindevil,2016-04-05 09:38:00,6254,I have seen the OPP And several boats and I guess they are going to use the plane as well and drones for Arial search but I mean this stuff should not happen !!! The water temp is basically just above freezing and 3 in a canoe with no pfd on !!! It's just stupidity ..... And all for a paddle boat .... Unreal
965309,jimmer,2016-04-05 13:25:00,2730,PDFs would have gave them a better chance since one of the three made it to shore. Sad.
965315,Gallie,2016-04-05 13:46:00,1215,"A sad story indeed, turns out one of them is a mechanic at my work. Im not sure how knowledgeable they were about what cold water can do to a person. I gotta admit though in the heat of the moment it could be easy just to jump in the canoe to go get the paddleboat 100 feet away without considering the consequences. You will be missed spencer."

965332,AKRISONER,2016-04-05 17:01:00,5558,"to me the obvious scenario here is that these guys reached out to grab the boat and a canoe being a canoe, it rolled dumped them in cold water and that was that...good luck going for a swim for 100 yards in the water at this time of year.  Sad sad story.  Never used to wear a PFD, but made the investment and got myself a cabellas guidewear auto inflatable...i wear it every time im on the water since.  Trust me guys its totally worth the investment!!!!"

965345,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-05 18:20:00,8243,"This is indeed very sad and frustrating. I don't have any numbers to quantify my gut feeling but it seems many more have lost their lives on the water this past winter and this spring. With all the bombardment of information coming at us from 360 degrees many would have learned by now that waters in this country are deadly cold. Even in lakes during the summer. I put my inflatable on before I get in the boat and only take it off when I get to the truck. Will it save me from hypothermia, no, but it may get me those few precious minutes I might need. When I hear that guys here can't afford an inflatable I want to scream. They are $99.99 now (on sale regularly at Fishing World, Hamilton). I bet the 1 rod and reel in their hands is more, just 1.
