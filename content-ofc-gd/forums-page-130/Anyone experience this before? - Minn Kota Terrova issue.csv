966873,ecmilley,2016-04-18 23:56:00,2163,Had lots of Minn Kota issues.foot pedals are famous and just had a circuit board go boom on my Maxum  Other thing to check is the armature there known for the commutater sliding down the shift causes overheating of brushes and brush Plate acts up more with higher demand
966878,FishFinder17,2016-04-19 00:36:00,139,I'm not expert on this stuff but I had issues with my Powerdrive V2 foot pedal last season. Took it to a licensed minn kota repair guy two weeks ago and he took my old one and handed me a brand new one in a bag...simple as that but perhaps that's because mine is less than a year old and under warranty?..  good luck finding a solve
966899,Ron,2016-04-19 03:49:00,1683,"fuse or circuit breaker maybe? I have a 24v riptide and my breaker was shot after 2 years, went with a generic inline 60amp fuse as it was fair bit cheaper than replacing the breaker and just keep extra fuses in the boat Mine had the same issue as you described. It was a weak breaker. Simple by pass test to rule this out."
966939,steelhedrmatt,2016-04-19 14:59:00,278,Manage to find one yet bill?  You're welcome to borrow mine anytime. I'm in alcona. I'll send you a pm with my phone number.
966944,misfish,2016-04-19 15:26:00,29133,LOL Just did as well. Sorry Matt.
966946,BillM,2016-04-19 16:15:00,17367,"Thanks Matt!   Rick was nice enough to offer up his foot pedal for me to try out, if that falls through I'll take you up on your offer.  Great bunch of guys here!"

966997,Lunker Larry,2016-04-19 22:00:00,122,"Some times the bushing on the prop drive shaft can dry out. Turn it by hand a bunch of times and see if there is any resistance. Easy to open up the motor head and check the bushings, bearings and brushes."

I'll let you know when I buy another new one and maybe you will be ready for an upgrade to my 80 Terrova. LOL"
967105,Sinker,2016-04-20 22:34:00,8692,Im ready anytime lol....could always use more power!
966790,BillM,2016-04-18 13:47:00,17367,"Took the boat out for this past weekend for some Gbay laker action and was having a weird issue with my Terrova (24V, 80lb, 60in)..  First off the motor felt pretty weak (I checked all the battery connections and had my onboard charger plugged in all winter).  If I used anything about say 6 or 7 on the foot pedal, the motor would surge like crazy (off, on, off, on, off, on)  Only when I turned the power down did it constantly run.   I took the foot pedal apart at the end of last season for the same issue.  I didn't find anything wrong with the foot pedal at all, so I'm kinda at a loss here.   I've got a few things to check.  1. Power at receptacle. 2. Double check wiring from batteries to motor 3. Perhaps the foot pedal is the culprit here? (Battery was toast on the iPilot link remote so I couldn't use that, doh!)  If you guys have any other thoughts I'd love to hear them.   I am planning on replacing the batteries soon anyhow, but wanted to nail down this problem first."
966794,Gerritt,2016-04-18 14:10:00,6129,"Bill,  Sounds like to potentiometer is shot....."
966795,BillM,2016-04-18 14:15:00,17367,"Bill,  Sounds like to potentiometer is shot.....  So the foot pedal is toasty?   That's the way I'm leaning (If everything else checks out)"
966798,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-18 14:37:00,8243,"That sucks Bill. I hope it's not serious. This is supposed to be the best part of the year for us boaters, I find it stressful. I cut the shrink wrap off yesterday and found I have, no bilge pump, 2 livewells not working, VHF not transmitting and I have a hole in my 2 year new fuel line primer bulb so I couldn't start it. Time to get outside get to work and off this laptop."

I wish I wasn't addicted to the foot pedal so much and could just get rid of it all together,  but it just becomes second nature.   Maybe I'll pick up that micro iPilot remote, because the big LCD unit is just too big to hold comfortably when you fish.  "
966802,kickingfrog,2016-04-18 15:25:00,8333,I had a similar  problem a few years ago. I just needed to clean up the conections in the foot pedal and tighten a few screws. Easy to check that before going further.

966812,fishindevil,2016-04-18 16:29:00,6254,I had the same issue bill last spring and I sprayed the foot pedal with reel majic spray and it worked fine
966817,BillM,2016-04-18 17:11:00,17367,"That's what I keep on reading man, the damn foot pedal.   I'll see if I can find a local Barrie OFC'r with a Terrova or Riptide and try their pedal and see if that resolves the issue (I'm guessing it will)"
966820,aplumma,2016-04-18 17:19:00,6896,bill you might find it is only under load so air testing may make it seem to be the pedal but isn't.  Art

966836,Terry,2016-04-18 18:57:00,14456,i had something like that  turned out to be a bit of water in the motor  rocky had to replace it
966840,BillM,2016-04-18 19:48:00,17367,"Terry, with the new unit you just picked up last year?  I'm pretty sure we've got the exact same motor."
966841,Terry,2016-04-18 19:54:00,14456,"no, the one before it it did weird things much like you described"
966842,Dan668,2016-04-18 20:07:00,1120,"My terrova before i sold it did some odd things,  turns out i had a ton of line caught under the prop."
966843,aplumma,2016-04-18 20:08:00,6896," Art, good thinking..  Looks like I'll need to test this on the water. Or just make sure that the one you have does it unloaded and the new one acts the same way. Short of an amp meter it is hard to know if it is one of the windings dropping out. You also might check in the head unit where the two wires are joined together they use a crimp butt connector that has corroded so only under load/heat does it mess up.  Art"

966852,BillM,2016-04-18 20:37:00,17367,"I am going to check those butt connectors like Art mentioned, that's come up a few times on Google.    Time to start checking stuff off the list.  Appreciate the insight fellas!  At least the motor troubles didn't stop this young fella from catching a nice laker (I'm still trying to convince him that holding it isn't 'gross')  "
966853,manitoubass2,2016-04-18 20:45:00,11391,Nice!!!
966862,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-18 22:26:00,8243,"I do have some good news. 2 cranks on the key after I changed the bulb on the 115 and she started and ran like a clock. Same with the 15HP kicker. I won't put the boat in the water without a bilge and a new VHF is in my near furure, important safety feature 15 miles out on Lake Erie. That bilge may be a bit of a chore to trouble shoot. I better get it done this week before Wormdunker and Fish Farmer catches all the perch in Erie.  My old wireless MotorGuide foot control would not work properly unless it was in the water under load as Art mentioned Bill. When I was looking at 2 new deep cells (it's 24V) at around 300 Samolians I now call it the hood ornament. I really don't need it for the fishing we do on Erie. It looks nice though up there. When I win the lottery one like yours will be on the boat. I see they have 48V now, that will pull me through the Erie waves.  It is probably something simple Bill, it usually is for everyone else but I."
966865,aplumma,2016-04-18 22:44:00,6896,Just give the lad a choice hold daddies hand or the fish. Bet he gives the fish a big old hug then. lol   Art
