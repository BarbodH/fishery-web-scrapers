967178,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-21 20:43:00,10439,I know on Mercs Flo-Torque props have hubs available for Yammy engines. Don't know if the ones with the integral hub will fit though. The Laser has the Flo-Torque hub correct?  See different hubs here:  http://www.westmarine.com/buy/mercury-marine--flo-torq-ii-hub-kits-and-components--P006_190_002_541
