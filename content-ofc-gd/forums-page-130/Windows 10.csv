I got really suspicious when they were giving me the hard sell to install.My suspicion is that once they have enough of us trapped inside 10 they'll start charging!

After getting caught up on all the updates, it seemed even slower than before I ditched 7 for 10.  I completely switched gears and installed Linux Ubuntu.  Now my laptop is fast again.  The user experience is very similar to 10 minutes to get up to speed.

Cheers   You can roll back to your previous OS if it was installed less than one month ago.    Applies to Windows 10     If it’s been less than a month since you upgraded to Windows 10, you can go back to your previous version of Windows by going to Settings > Update & security > Recovery  and selecting either Go back to Windows 7 or Go back to Windows 8.1. This won't affect your personal files, but it will remove any apps you installed after the upgrade to Windows 10. Learn more.   If it’s been more than a month, this option won’t be available in Settings and you’ll need to use a different recovery option.       "

It's an easy google.That will disable the autoupgade. Not for regular users. Never10 does that so there is no chance of danger to registry. Plus it has other features if required.

New operating systems and software/applications always sound great and generate a lot of excitement when they're first released, but there's usually a period where they may not be all they're cracked up to be until enough errors are reported to generate updates with fixes... This is just one of many horror stories out there but one I have first hand knowledge of ... Google ""windows10 start icon not working"" to see one of the big problems currently plaguing Microsoft, and also look at the possible fixes.  I have a new laptop with windows 7, states it's windows 10 compatible, that is part of the courses I'm currently taking.  Another fellow in the class with the identical setup, who knows zilch about computers (it's his first exposure to them) upgraded to 10 when the (frequent) popup adivsed him to because he figured the computer was telling him to do it.  Within 3 days his start icon stopped working, effectively making the laptop unusable at all.  I spent about 3 hours trying all the recommended fixes with a service tech on the phone to guide me, my laptop displaying all the commands to try, none worked.  Why?  becausue all the fixes require an internet connection working on the affected computer, and there ain't no way to tell if you're connected when this happens until the effort fails.  Fortunately for the other guy, the company that supplied our laptops also took the time to create system backups on cd's so he could do a full restore.  Once I determined it was a waste of time to keep trying to fix Windows 10, I told him good luck, call the tech, do the restore with him, ya don't need me!, and went back to learning other stuff listening to him swearing about the long boring process, put the disc in, take the disc out... etc. I don't know, because the other user can't tell me, if there were any updates done to his Windows 10 AFTER he installed it.  It could well be that a fix is already available but as I've already made my mind up I'm not gonna worry about it just yet. I'll do the windows 10 at the last possible moment and hope they have all the bugs fixed by then...  Michael"

That can be real tricky to fix sometimes...  As for old peripherals not working with Win 10 it is so EASY to blame Microsoft when the truth is the manufacturer as decided to orphan your old purchase by not offering updated drivers. Perhaps so you will rush out and buy a replacement... Remember how much money was wasted by consumers over Y2K, companies and CEO's made trillions though."
956572,atvaholic,2016-02-07 01:27:00,271,I have 3 computers I have upgraded to Windows 10 without issues. However if its an older computer (you stated you have XP) I would avoid the upgrade. XP runs much quicker.

What I mean by that is I have tons of RAM and processing speed to spare, even compared to current laptops (1.7 GHz processor with 6g RAM). I could see the upgrade being unsuccessful if you're running an older laptop that won't be able to keep up with the new OS. If you're going to do it, backup everything to an external hard drive, then completely wipe the computer, then install 10 from scratch.  I would say you're at a crossroads between upgrading the OS, sticking with your current setup, or purchasing a new laptop with 10 already installed (or one with good specs and 8 as the OS). Upgrading from 8 shouldn't be problematic at all."

Upgrading from 8 shouldn't be problematic at all.  I agree clean installs are better, so if you are going to accept the upgrade, do a BACKUP of all your data and make sure you have access to the installation sources for all your programs and apps you want to keep. INCLUDING your old OS should you want to revert to it if something doesn't work in win 10.  Then make sure you have a VALID windows key for either 7, 8, 8.1 or 10... You will need that key to validate windows 10.  The above method is a bit quicker than when Microsoft forced you to do the upgrade, then wait until you could see it was validated, before doing a clean install. Before an update last October, using an old win key wouldn't validate a clean install of Win 10.... However, once you had validated the upgrade you could do clean installs and Microsoft's servers would recognize your system specs and validate a fresh install.  The advantage IMHO to doing it the old way, was I was able to make sure it would all work with my older peripherals, and programs before wiping out my previous version of windows. Without having to do a complete reinstall of everything if I didn't like win 10 or it didn't work with something older I wanted to keep.  The old way still had the option of reverting back to Win 7 and not losing anything or having to reinstall any programs or apps that doing a clean install of Win 10 I didn't like or couldn't use would have involved."

Microsoft has also snuck in some of those user trackers into Win 7 and 8 in some of their updates, the sneaky buggers Cheers Yea it's getting real bad now. Just heard of another report today of a fellow student's OS being automatically upgraded to Win10 without his authorization. Like I mentioned earlier about MS including whatever they want in their updates, now it can include tons (over 6Gb) of Win10 files just waiting to be installed.  The more I hear about win10 the scarier it gets. This quote from a real good site...""Windows 10 has become controversial due to Microsoft's evolution of their Windows operating system platform into a service which, among other things, aggressively monitors and reports on its users activities."" In other words you have no assumption of privacy anymore as far as Microsoft is concerned. For all I know there could even be keyloggers built in to the OS. Scary stuff folks for the likes of us with ""pcs"" but what about corporate usage??  So my strong advice is to NOT do the upgrade. They just want to fool everyone into believing that newer is better but it's a poison pill IMO. That's why they're pushing it so hard . And guess what? If you do the upgrade you can't go back without a clean install of the earlier OS. So save/find/d/l your old install disks. Make an image disc of your hard drive and save it as a backup that you can reinstall on a formatted drive.  Here's my tip of the d/m/y hehe. Just found out from my instructor today about this neat little utility that will protect your privacy and even clean your system while preventing from win10 unwanted installation. Its called Never10. It doesn't install anything on your system at all, it just does it's registry changes etc., then you click the appropriate boxes after it's done the scan.  Here's the link... https://www.grc.com/never10.htm   Go to freeware/utilities/never10 and download. Use it and and you will feel cleansed and protected.   Also excellent for command line use in an enterprise environment. This Steve Gibson guy is amazing from what I've seen so far. His Spinrite proggy can revive a hard disk to retrieve data that was thought lost.  I hope this helps to warn folks about the way things are going now in this world of ours. Remember those old futuristic sci-fi flicks where big brother knew everything about everybody. Lol it's here now. Surveillance cameras are everywhere, most phones have gps and can be tracked, even new cars can be remotely controlled once vehicle systems are hacked into.  I'm not paranoid but Ive been around for 60 years now and I'm still leery of any entity that wants to know everything about everyone. Just doesn't sit right with me ya know. Technology now makes it so possible. Makes sense to me.  Cheers folks"
