966240,Meely,2016-04-13 04:27:00,282,"Hello Gang, I have an old 1973 coytage bathroom counter top that needs a facelift. I dont want to get into any heavy or big renos but just a light re-do. Does anyone have any experience on painting or re-surfacing a bathroom counter top? What product should I use etc. Looking for materials that I can pick up at any local home reno joint.  Thanks for any help.  Meely"

It wasn't hard to do at all but it was a little time consuming because of the waiting time between each step. We got the kit on special at Home Hardware and I think it was about $100.00.  http://www.techstone.ca/ct_refinish_kit.html  It turned out really well, you would be more than welcome to stop by and have a look if you like."

X2...if it was the whole kitchen and had backslapsh tiles butting down to the counter maybe a recoat would be cheaper/easier but a small vanity top is an easy DIY."

When you get into a small reno on a structure like this, it always turns into WAY MORE than what was expected... A counter top turns into new water supplies, sink, drain and taps, in the blink of an eye or the slip of a wrench. Trust me..... Cliffs solution is what the OP is asking for."

That's why we opted for the refinishing and to be honest with you it turned out so well that a couple of friends have also done theirs with it."

966316,wormdunker,2016-04-13 18:45:00,1711,"Hey Tom, I've been there!  Water supplies, drain, trap, the whole nine yards!  Not being a smart ass, if 1973 original, probably a bathroom reno is the way to go.  All depends on budget.  If bath renovation is going to cut into fishing gear budget - I'd wash my hands in a 5 gallon pail!  LOL!"

A whole reno is probably needed, but a simple facelift may be all that's in the budget. $100.00 can of facelift and some DIY muscle can save a lot of reno money for toys.....  or until a proper reno can be budgeted for and done at some time in the future."

966320,leaf4,2016-04-13 19:56:00,2466,Would replacing the vanity be an option? Quick disconnect and maybe some soldering and you're back in business for probably 200-300
966362,wormdunker,2016-04-14 07:22:00,1711,"Good point for shopping at Habitat for Humanity.  I viewed a 36"" bathroom vanity for $120.00 complete with countertop & sink.  Taps are 90- 100 bux."
966831,fisher,2016-04-18 18:17:00,451,"When I replaced my laminate counter top from my kitchen a few years back with a different material, I posted an ad on kijiji for the free laminate counter top just so I didn't have to dispose of it.  The counter top was in great shape..may want to search kijiji or craigslist for similar free counter tops.  Cut a piece to fit and then just swap out the sink/plumbing.  In fact, I see there a few ads on Kijiji right now offering free counter tops."
