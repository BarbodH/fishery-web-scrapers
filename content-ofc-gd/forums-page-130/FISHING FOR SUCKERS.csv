966989,PUMP KNOWS,2016-04-19 20:45:00,937,^^^ I wish I knew a place where I can use these suckers for channel cats in the city.  Those are whistlemouth trout.  The Don sure looks good..back in my day there it was a brown thick mess..how far up are you  I'm actually close to the lower Don.  I've heard stories how the don was such a mess back in the days.  People would just dump anything in that river from motorcycles to unwanted vehicles.

Back in the day, they searched the Don for Jimmy Hoffa, but then realized that he hadn't cleared the Canadian Customs at Windsor and went back to searching in Michigan"
