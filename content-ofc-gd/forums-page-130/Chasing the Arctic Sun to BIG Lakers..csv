966149,Sterling,2016-04-12 01:54:00,477,That's amazing. This will be a good read with coffee first thing in the morning .
966151,Grimace,2016-04-12 02:22:00,2020,I was in Cambridge Bay in February of 2015 and found it really nice.  I was in Iqaluit in April of 2015.  I like Cambridge Bay better.  I would like to visit both places again in the summer.
966152,Gallie,2016-04-12 02:48:00,1215,"Wow bunk, hit another one outta the park! Fantastic all around!!!"
966155,chris.brock,2016-04-12 03:30:00,4053,"Bunk's life is the polar opposite of a mundane, boring existence. Some guys sit around and talk about stuff, Bunk just does stuff.  Do you still have Nanook's fang? Sometimes stuff like that mysteriously disappears, like the feather you found on the riverbank."
966156,landry,2016-04-12 03:39:00,1005,Your reports are always amazing. You walk the walk and live life fully. Kudos.
966158,wormdunker,2016-04-12 06:35:00,1711,Awesome story Mr. Bunk!  Thanx!  Your pix are incredible!
966162,Jds63,2016-04-12 11:32:00,1365,Absolutely phenomenal report Drew !!!!! Thanks for putting that together. Really enjoyed reading about your days working up north as well.
966163,Sinker,2016-04-12 11:42:00,8692,"Great report, but not even close to as good as sitting around the woodstove shooting the bull face to face. Always great to see ya!! Nice big lakers man! Wicked!  S."
966164,BassMan11,2016-04-12 11:59:00,583,Outstanding report as per usual Bunk! Thanks for taking the time.
966166,leaf4,2016-04-12 12:13:00,2466,"Great story, pictures and scenery thanks for sharing it looks amazing out there"
966167,Musky or Specks,2016-04-12 12:26:00,2710,Man the north is so perilously beautiful. You are so fortunate to have a skill that allows you to travel the way you do. I enjoyed the travelogue part of your trip much more than the fishing report although those are some large lakers. Thanks
966168,BillM,2016-04-12 12:29:00,17367,"I honestly would have thought slaying big greasers up there during the winter wouldn't be that hard of a task, I guess I'm wrong, lol!!   Great report man!  Makes me miss that place!"
966171,Joey,2016-04-12 12:49:00,9122,Well the pictures are outstanding.  Gonna read it while on my morning break.  Thanks for sharing Drew!
966172,fishindevil,2016-04-12 12:59:00,6254,wow bunk what an awesome read !!! pics are amazing too....what a life experience man...wow
966173,Guidofisherman,2016-04-12 13:07:00,206,"What an excellent read. While most of us can't wait for winter to pass, you shared the beauty of life in the True North.  This is a sense of ""Arctic community life"" most of us will never visit, but now appreciate.  With heart-wrenching stories of some northern communities in the news lately, your tribute is a testament to the fact that, ""the glass is neither half full nor half empty"", rather it can be refilled with wonderful memories. Thanks for sharing this positive attitude."
966174,ratherboutdoors,2016-04-12 13:24:00,132,"Exceptional!!!  I really enjoyed that report, keep them coming."
966176,LeXXington,2016-04-12 13:33:00,1928,Wow amazing read.
966178,cl_fishin,2016-04-12 13:48:00,138,Great stuff.............enjoyed it
966179,Moosebunk,2016-04-12 13:49:00,3970,"I was in Cambridge Bay in February of 2015 and found it really nice.  I was in Iqaluit in April of 2015.  I like Cambridge Bay better.  I would like to visit both places again in the summer.  CamBay has a really great community feel with tonnes going on and going for it.  Agreed, it is really nice.  Iqaluit... I'm sure there will be days there in the future while likely passing through to other Baffin towns.  Would enjoy visiting all 30 or so communities in Nunavut.  Do you still have Nanook's fang? Sometimes stuff like that mysteriously disappears, like the feather you found on the riverbank.  I'll have it forever Chris, and will try to collect more. You have a wicked memory too man, the feather was actually found.  It's now part of dream catcher over our bed that has an eagle and osprey feather as well.  Great report, but not even close to as good as sitting around the woodstove shooting the bull face to face.  Hoping next year again Shane... unless before then we finally hook-up for a softwater day half way.  I honestly would have thought slaying big greasers up there during the winter wouldn't be that hard of a task, I guess I'm wrong, lol!!   Great report man!  Makes me miss that place!  Not really the same water Bill, or even the same fishing during the softwater for that matter.  What an excellent read. While most of us can't wait for winter to pass, you shared the beauty of life in the True North.  This is a sense of ""Arctic community life"" most of us will never visit, but now appreciate.  With heart-wrenching stories of some northern communities in the news lately, your tribute is a testament to the fact that, ""the glass is neither half full nor half empty"", rather it can be refilled with wonderful memories. Thanks for sharing this positive attitude.  I was working the weekend in Attawapiskat last September when the first six attempts were made.  A sad reality has snowballed since then, and now it is said over 100 people in the year or less have made suicide attempts.  It is a helluva place to work at times, but doesn't have to be.  And certainly, it doesn't have to be a bad place to live either.  There's much to all of it really, nothing I'll get into here.  Wish for much better for those kids and their families.  And my co-workers in the trenches on those busy nights and weekends, dealing with all this as I actually have many, many times as well, I wish much for them too."
966180,mr blizzard,2016-04-12 14:22:00,1589,"Fantastic composition is an understatement  The narrative side alone is priceless, not to mention the pictures which are over the top  So sorry I could not meet up with you this time like we did for your prior trip  I will make sure we get together on your next trip up take care Drew"
