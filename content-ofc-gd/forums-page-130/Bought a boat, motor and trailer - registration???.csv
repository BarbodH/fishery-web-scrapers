966821,Tom McCutcheon,2016-04-18 17:24:00,627,"I am assuming this is used? Normally, the seller keeps the plate from the trailer and that portion of the ownership and then you need to then register it in your name with new plate. Anything over a 9.9 horsepower motor needs to be registered with Service Canada. They will then assign you a registration number which you can then put on the side of the boat. Keep your receipts. They may come back at you in a year or two for sales tax. You may also want to get separate receipts for the boat and motor and then the trailer."
966830,G.mech,2016-04-18 18:14:00,830,i think all the info you will need can be found here for the boat and trailer:  http://boating.ncf.ca/license.html
966837,Dutch01,2016-04-18 19:04:00,1431,"^^^ This. When you go to register your trailer, they will ask for a receipt. If your receipt is for a boat, motor and trailer, you will pay tax on the whole amount. If you a receipt for the trailer only you will pay less tax."
966845,Fisherman,2016-04-18 20:25:00,7201,"And keep a copy of the receipt with you in the boat/tacklebox or dry box, it's your ownership.  The registration is not considered ownership."
