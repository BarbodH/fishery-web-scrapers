967006,kickingfrog,2016-04-19 23:28:00,8333,A friend is looking at a place on Mill Lake and I figured this would be a good place to look for any intel on the lake. PM if you prefer.  Thanks

967017,Rizzo,2016-04-20 01:27:00,4754,"Fished it a couple of times. Very close to town which some may like, others may not. Fishing was good for smallmouth bass as I recall. Apparently pickerel and pike too but we didn't target, or catch, any of those"

967038,can u fish,2016-04-20 11:57:00,326,Mill Lake is very close to town you can see it right off the 400 Hwy it has pike and walleye and it was stocked with Splake a few years ago.
967050,Headhunter,2016-04-20 13:01:00,5703,"Wife's cousin had a cottage on one of the islands visable from the highway. Too close for comfort for me, but they liked it while they had it. We could order a pizza and have it delivered to the government dock! I fished a few areas of the lake, anything specific you are looking for? HH"
967062,netminder,2016-04-20 15:31:00,514,"I'm also likely to be headed to a friend's cottage at some point this summer too to do some fishing. Probably be targeting bass by then but if there are walleye or splake available I'd like to check those out too. Never fished there before personally, but they do tell me the bass fishing is pretty fun."
967073,kickingfrog,2016-04-20 16:53:00,8333,"My friend is considering buying  a cottage. He asked me about the lake. I was wondering about the type of Lake it is. Deep/weedy etc. Is the lake getting better or worse? Is it the goto lake in the area or do most fish else where. Is it the type of Lake that has tons of water skiers and jet skis. Did it get fished out by yokels in the 70's and 80's. Save ""your spots"" if there are fish, I'll find them. Although  I have some insight as to why he might be getting a deal."

967206,Rizzo,2016-04-21 23:17:00,4754,meh....a little arsenic won't kill you....oh..wait a minute...
