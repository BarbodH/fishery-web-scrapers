967016,mike rousseau,2016-04-20 01:23:00,4661,Hello  So last year I stumbled upon a spring perch spot by accident fishing carp... Only problem was it was at the end of the spring bite when I found it and a few days later upon my return the bite had pretty well ended...  So for the past year this spot has been bouncing around in the back of my mind waiting for the right conditions this year to try again  Managed to get out Sunday by boat to keep options open in that great weather we had and although it was slow and steady we had fun and had plenty of perch for supper... Lucky we took the boat because they let the water down about a foot and the perch moved out far enough from shore that we couldn't have casted that far...  We caught almost all our fish on slip floats in a small shallow bay with soft plastic minnow baits... I used the yamaminnow for the first time and did well...
