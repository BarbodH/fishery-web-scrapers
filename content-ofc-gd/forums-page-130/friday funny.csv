His elderly buddy remarked that he, too, had gone to the very same dentist two years before.  ""Is that so?"" asked the first old guy. ""Did he do a good job?""  The second oldster replied, ""Well, I was on the golf course yesterday when a guy on the next fairway hooked a shot.  The ball must have been going at least 180 mph when it slammed me right in the testicles.""  The first old guy was confused and asked, ""What the hell does that have to do with your dentures?""  ""It was the first time in two years my teeth didn't hurt."""

966636,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-16 17:10:00,8243,Good one. Trainers used to take a pair of pliers and pinch your arm with them if you got a cramp. It hurt so bad you didn't mind the pain from the Charlie horse. Maybe some science to it.
