966850,dr_zayas,2016-04-18 20:32:00,10,Just thought I'd give a quick update from the weekend. Lake of Bays is still pretty iced up in the north end near Dorset where I was. The ice is pretty thin in most places and there are parts that are open that have been getting more sun so hopefully it has opened up enough to get a boat in the water in the next week or two!  https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4088FC4D6E65BB92!2076&authkey=!ADDknDAYGQqENUk&ithint=folder%2c
