967091,FishOn,2016-04-20 20:53:00,136,Just bought a brand new   (2015 Yamaha 2.5 hp)   for $795 plus tax. Planning to use it  as a trolling motor on  a 16' Princecraft Resorter  boat 650 lb gross weight. Will it be good enough to do the job? Thanks
967093,Terry,2016-04-20 20:57:00,14456,in heavy wind/waves no tight corners  no but 85/90% of the time  is should work
967095,FishOn,2016-04-20 21:04:00,136,Maybe 6hp would have been a better choice. But the price was attractive.
967098,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-20 21:13:00,10439,"I have a 4hp 2 stroke as a backup engine on my 18 footer. It will push the boat to 7MPH. My boats dry hull weight is 950#'s. Then you add 3 batteries, an 80# TM, 18 gallons of fuel a 115 HP 4 stroke and a couple of anglers so 7 MPH is fine. My guess is you will get similar speeds with the 2.5 at WOT."
967100,chris.brock,2016-04-20 21:24:00,4053,"It isn't the ideal trolling motor for that boat but yeah, good price and that little thing will hold it's value."
967101,reelingMachine,2016-04-20 21:55:00,29,"May I ask where you bought it? I need a slightly bigger fella, but F2.5B listed on yamaha-motor.ca for 1113."
967102,Joeytier,2016-04-20 22:05:00,3990,"That's a great deal, too bad you can't get small 2 strokes anymore.  Put that thing on a square stern and you've an unbeatable backlake rig"
967110,pike slayer,2016-04-20 23:51:00,1177,I'll gladly take it off your hands for what you boat it for
967369,FishOn,2016-04-22 23:27:00,136,I decided to cancel the deal. I am going with bow mount electric motor. If anyone is interested to grab this deal send me a PM. I will let them know the location. They only had two in the warehouse at that price.
967371,KawarthaGuy,2016-04-23 00:05:00,46,"Hey,  I have the 2.5 yam on my 15 ft as a backup.  Great little motor, starts on first pull and pushes the boat along but noisy. I don't use it for trolling as the 30 HP yam w adjustable RPM does a better job imho.  Kawartha Guy"
