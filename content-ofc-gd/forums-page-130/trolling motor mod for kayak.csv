967145,super dave,2016-04-21 14:46:00,323,So I recent ripped apart my trolling motor and built a small control box so it sits beside me on the kayak.  This box will control the speed.   There are two wires that are a bit thicker gauge.  I can't seem to find the right gauge at the big box stores.   Anyone know where I can get wires in the Scarborough/Pickering area?  I temporarily used thinner gauge wires and it works but it's not reaching max speed so im guessing the thinner gauge is restricting max output.  Thanks.

Fantastic, I even I think I can still get in and out of one, with an electric I would only need back up paddles. That I would love to try."
