966697,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-17 03:45:00,8243,"Sounds good from here. A clean install. Did you wire it to a fuse on the panel or strait to the battery with a in line fuse? Because of the bad location of my fuse panel I ran it straight to the battery. I am always wondering why StarCraft would put a fuse panel that a human can't access, my only complaint on my barge."
966699,jjcanoe,2016-04-17 03:57:00,744,"Crestliner pre-wires EVERYTHING! Speaker wires were already in place and labelled, power wires coiled neatly and came with butt connectors just waiting to be crimped, everything was so neat and tidy under the dash I felt bad cutting off a few factory zip ties to free up the wiring. A few crimps, some shrinktube, and a fuse in the panel and I was rocking the driveway. Easiest install I've ever done!"

966721,OhioFisherman,2016-04-17 17:19:00,6623,What kind of music do fish like? Do good vibrations equal more bites?
966723,jjcanoe,2016-04-17 18:17:00,744,I don't notice the lack of tunes until nothing is biting for a while...  maybe I'll experiment with what tunes are on when the bite is hot or cold lol
966724,jjcanoe,2016-04-17 18:20:00,744,Hooked up an auxiliary port as well so I can bring my Satellite radio with me or the kids Iphone  (hope it's not his music that makes them bite!)
966726,OhioFisherman,2016-04-17 18:32:00,6623,"LOL, that's the spirit jj! The only boat I had a stereo in was my cruiser, and since I usually shanghaied a young lady for company? there was always something else to do!"
