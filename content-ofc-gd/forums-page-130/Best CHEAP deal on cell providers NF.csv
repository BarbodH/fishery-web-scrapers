966505,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-15 01:35:00,8243,"Is what I'm paying fair, OK, good, not so good? If I go prepaid as many do would it be easier on the budget, which is getting smaller every month. No raise for 16 years now.  Thanks for your help GBW."
966508,GBW,2016-04-15 01:44:00,8460,"Is what I'm paying fair, OK, good, not so good? If I go prepaid as many do would it be easier on the budget, which is getting smaller every month. No raise for 16 years now.  Thanks for your help GBW. No worries, $21.50 a month for 20 total texts and only to calling home can be beat.  Check the PC link I posted as to costs (and no I don't work for them).  If one cell is NOT used for text and just calls then the $15 a mth may do and the other get's a bit bigger or the same plan.  Would need more info as to how both phones are used there for better info. My folks are now late 60's and they are now on pre-paid BUT if they use it more than they intended some months they do have to ""top up"" a bit early so...  Most months they do save."
966509,GBW,2016-04-15 01:47:00,8460,"After reading the $15 plan again, if all outbound calls are local then it's a savings.  You also get PC phone to PC phone free calls and unlimited texts in that rate. *edit to add outbound*  if LD calling then 20 cents a min"
966530,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-15 05:18:00,8243,"Geoff, ( forgive me if I have the name wrong) I looked at the PC packages. If PC is presidents choice they are available at a few places here like Shoppers or Zehrs. If I have to pay 20 cents a minute on top of the 15 or 25 buck package that's going to add up pretty quick since one of the phones is now our home number. My wife has sisters across North America. Here and the US. Both phones come to around 80 bucks a month and I was wrong about the price of the phones it's an extra 10 bucks for a few months more to buy them outright. Zero data usage. Unlimited LD North America. At 20 cents a minute and maybe an hour a day on prime time calls which is about right after checking my phone that's $360.00 a month unless I'm missing something. That's one expensive camera.  Please advise, thanks.  Johnny D  edit: we gave up the 22 buck a month phones because dear wife needed a smart phone as 20 texts were no longer enough as her new boss is texting her and they are in the same store 100 feet away, I don't get that either, the phone is on her desk but she texts everyone. My wife works full time, I no longer work so if I want to go fishing etc. etc. I go with the flow. Plus I wanted to stop paying Ma Bell and needed a better phone than my 10 year old flip phone to use as the land line. I'm missing something about the plans."
966610,GBW,2016-04-16 00:53:00,8460,"Not to many plans out there in the $80 rand with unlimited LD to CAN/US so you might have to keep her's the same.  Your Johnny you should be able to change around to save some money.  And you go have my name right and even spelt right. So, what do YOU need your phone to do?"
966655,GBW,2016-04-16 20:21:00,8460,Give me a shout on Sunday 705 928-8899 Sorry Cliff but it looks like I have to go to Peterborough tomorrow after I take my kids home.  Pick up my new truck bed cover and not sure on when I'll be back.  Another day or you can come for a quick visit here in the evening.  Let me know.
966705,Big Cliff,2016-04-17 10:45:00,6899,"No problem Geoff, will hook up later in the week, think I am coming down with a cold, got pretty wet yesterday putting the dock in."
966707,Canuck2fan,2016-04-17 11:42:00,1444,"In December I got an AT&T Microsoft Lumia 640 from the States for just over 58.00 Canadian. They are STILL on sale at Walmart in the U.S. for 29.99 U.S. or at Walgreens for less, if you can find one. Trouble is it for instore pickup only now. Great phone for surfing, email and it has offline maps for GPS with the 8.1 OS and is supposed to with win 10 too but I haven't upgraded. Another HUGE bonus with AT&T no contract phones like this if you never turn the phone on with their sim in it, you can email them to get a FREE unlock code.  Once the phone is unlocked it will work with just about every provider in Canada...  I then got a nano sim from Petro Canada and got their 15 dollar a month plan that includes 100 minutes anywhere in Canada with unlimited texting and I added 500 mb of data for another 15 a month. No contract and you can collect Petro points for every renewal. Petro Can seems to alternate deals on plans every month of so the other offer I have seen is 200 anywhere anytime minutes with unlimited texting for 20 a month with data at .10 a mb or 100mb for 10.00 or 500mb for 15.00 or 1GB for 30.00. You can set up automatic renewals online or buy vouchers at Petro Can gas stations.  The only drawback to the phone is the lack of apps for some people on the Windows platform, which doesn't bother me as I only occasionally surf the net when the fish aren't biting and check my email. I retired my GPS and point and shoot camera after getting the phone. If you go to the U.S. or have a friend who can pick you up one it is a great deal for a no contract smart phone, that be unlocked for free. If you already have Windows 8.1 the phone comes with the same OS so the learning curve isn't that steep.  Instructions to unlock the phone for free with the code from AT&T in the link below. Just remember NEVER turn the phone on with the AT&T sim card installed as that will lock it to AT&T's network so you will have to wait 6 months to get a free unlock code. I unlocked 2 phones using the instructions here so I know it works, and the phone will work on Wind, Bell, Rogers, Telus, 7-Eleven and Petro Canada....  https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/3u02t3/how_to_unlock_your_att_lumia_640_gophone_united/"

966136,Hoppy,2016-04-12 01:06:00,95,Brian you don't need to have your data turned on to use the navionics app. Just download the Simcoe map at home over wifi and the gps in the phone does not use data. Buy a phone outright and then you can get a cheaper plan it will save you money. I use virgin mobile pay as you go and I use spend just over a hundred a year. Other carriers offer cheap plans if you buy your own phone also. Check out Zenfone 2 from Asus nice phone for the money.

966196,Big Cliff,2016-04-12 19:47:00,6899,"I'm interested in this topic; Both Sue and I have iPhone 4S that I bought outright. We are currently with Virgin Mobile because they use the bell network and the coverage is fantastic. Now I have a data plan because I use my phone for business and Sue is on my bill but doesn't have a data plan, she doesn't need one.  I currently pay $118.65 a month but I think there might be better plans out there for us. In the very near future I want to get rid of our land line and both Sue and I will just use our cell phones, we don't make a lot of long distance calls and to be honest with you I'm not even sure what ""data"" is on the phone but I think I have 5 GB, I use google maps text, and talk but that's about it (oh and sometimes play solitare or sudoko).  They need to have a place where us old folks can go where some smart donkey can figure out what we really do need and set it up for us.  Hey Geoff want to start a bisiness: (not implying you are a donkey) ""Simple Technology for Seniors"". Bring us your cell phones, tablets, laptops and we'll help you set them up and make sure you are getting what YOU need! Sue and I would sign up right now!"
966197,Terry,2016-04-12 19:56:00,14456,"Cliff, you dont need 5gig   most likely you dont use 1 gig a month you can go to setting/cell and see what you gave used and what apps used it then you can reset the counter and see what you use in 30 days"

966200,Terry,2016-04-12 20:32:00,14456,so if you have never reset it   you have not used a gig in a year   and you  are paying fo 5 gig a month   time to downsize the plan an save money

Bring us your cell phones, tablets, laptops and we'll help you set them up and make sure you are getting what YOU need! Sue and I would sign up right now! I sure would Cliff if I could but getting a partnership like that to offer to more than one cell provider for varying plans will not happen unless I buy the old Future Shop name or have many retail chains...  I'll still help you however.  I know that because I use my home wifi or free wifi at places like Tim's I keep it under 1/2 a gig a month.  Apple brand items tend to use 2 to 4 x the data than the andriod devices do.  Check out the prepaid options as my folks use that and it's very cost effective for them.  I think they have a 7-11 prepaid?  Just make sure who ever the company is, they rent off Bell/Virgin vs rent off Rogers.  Where we are there are 4x more Bell towers than Rogers hence the signal coverage...  I hope that helps"
966206,GBW,2016-04-12 21:29:00,8460,"A plan like this Cliff and your cell is $40 a mth and Sue is either $15 or $25 http://www.pcmobile.ca/prepaid_plans_features.jsp PC mobile prepaid service uses the same network as Bell, which serves over 98% of the Canadian population- with no zones!"

966498,Old Ironmaker,2016-04-15 01:15:00,8243,"Since I no longer have a Millenial at my beckoned call at work I struggle when it comes to newer technology. But I finally got rid of our Bell land line after being with them since 1973 and joined the 21st century. When I called Bell to cancel some young lady said ""OK"" bye, bye. No gold watch for me. 43 years and about 20 grand later, man it adds up. It was up to 75 bucks a month. We had Koodo phones that were $21.50 a month each, basically call home or 911, 20 free texts a month. The kids have 20 texts before they get to work if they have work to get to. I know kids that rack up monthly bills of 300 bananas and more, I don't get it. . One of the guys said their Grand Daughter called them crying because she had a $700.00 monthly bill and couldn't tell her parents. Yea I don't get it.  We went with Koodo and have 2 Motorola somethings, I don't know if it's a I Phone or smart phone, android or what, it rings and I swipe something and say hello. Zero data usage of which we don't need. I found that data usage can kill you. I use it for Wifi if at Timmies a few times. The bill is around 80 bucks a month for both phones. We had enough Koodo points that the phones were free. I do miss sticking a real phone between my shoulder and neck and be able to do other things while on the phone. I'm most impressed with the camera on these things. I don't know if 40 bucks each with unlimited long distance is OK, good, or not so good. I'm old fashined, I use the thing to talk to other people on.  edit: My cousin the US does't have a land line but has an extension of the cell phones that sits ina charging cradle that looks and works like the old land line phones. Is there any service up here that has something similar? I am very afraid I'm going to loose, drop, break this new home phone I take with me."

Some rent off Bell towers, others off Rogers.  You need a big coverage area you go Bell 3rd parties if not Bell direct as they too do pre-paid."
