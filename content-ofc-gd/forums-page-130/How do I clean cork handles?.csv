966159,Mister G,2016-04-12 10:21:00,1429,"Over the many years of using cork handle rods, especially if minnow are used like fishing for Lake Erie perch, I have found the very best way to clean the handle and the rest of the rod is to take it in the shower with you.  A lite SOS pad on ONLY the cork will bring it back to new in about 1 minute and then using a wash cloth with soap will get most of the minnow scales off the rest of the rod. Don't use anything but soap and a wash cloth on the rod blank or you will take off the finish."

My wife is pretty understanding but when I turned 65 she said I had to stop dancing around nude on opening day, I can still dance around but I have to be wearing something; now if I could only figure out where my speedo went, she swears she hasn't seen it!"

965962,Big Cliff,2016-04-10 19:56:00,6899,"I have a custom made rod that was given to me for Christmas by my staff about 20 years ago, I love this rod, not only is it an excellent rod but it means a lot to me. The cork is getting very grey and old looking and I would like to refresh it but I'm not sure how or what to do.  I know we have many experts on here so I thought perhaps someone could tell me the best way to do it.  All help would be much appreciated!"

965965,kickingfrog,2016-04-10 20:16:00,8333,I've used a little dish soap and a gentle brush and that has worked. I'm willing to try the alcohol suggested above.

965973,Lape0019,2016-04-10 20:32:00,647,"I use magic eraser as well. Works great. A light sanding works well too. After that, if you can find some u40 cork sealer, it will prevent it from getting as dirty afterwards."
965975,Fisherpete,2016-04-10 20:38:00,1814,Yup 30 seconds with a wet magic eraser and she's purdy again

965992,misfish,2016-04-10 21:51:00,29133,I find myself always washing my hands off in the water and wipe my handles the same with a towel. 99% of my cork handles look new.  I hate roe goooo on my handles
965994,mike rousseau,2016-04-10 21:57:00,4661,Thinking the same thing...
966003,chris.brock,2016-04-10 23:04:00,4053,Who cleans away character??  Exactly.  That's why I like cork instead of synthetic foam/ plastic crap handles. Battle scars and history.
966022,FloatnFly,2016-04-11 00:57:00,1640,little light sanding would do the trick
966034,Big Cliff,2016-04-11 08:07:00,6899,"Magic eraser and a little water, removed the dirt, left the battle scars. Thanks for the help!"
966040,BillM,2016-04-11 12:50:00,17367,"I always clean the cork on my rods, character be damned, lol.   A little soap/water and some elbow grease.   Dirty cork never looks good no matter how many fish you've landed."
