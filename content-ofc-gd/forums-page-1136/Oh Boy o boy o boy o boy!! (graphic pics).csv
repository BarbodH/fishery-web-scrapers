121911,bigbuck,2007-10-09 20:08:00,2449,"I can hear Dueling Banjos now................. TJ, the 180 will do the job quite nicely (with either a 30-06 or a 300 Win Mag). You don't need more than that. Make sure you spend the little bit extra and buy the top-shelf factory loads. They'll be worth it in penetration and down range ballistics. Have fun, I'm green with envy."
121914,TJQ,2007-10-09 20:26:00,7806," LOL..  I just read it..  if all the guys in my picture were Asian and they all had tags...  I can't see why anyone would say anything.... except I wonder what grain bullet size they were using... lol  hicks... hell... I AM, AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BUSHPIG AND PROUD OF IT!!  umm and im gonna stick with my 180 silvertip... big/small enough to handle anything.....  even niptippers....  (can I say that here??)"
121916,Bassloadingzone,2007-10-09 20:45:00,32,"Kinda figured youed feel the way,LOL i just feel bad for the guy trying to get his point across, looks like hes gettin beat up bad on that site"

121934,misfish,2007-10-09 22:30:00,29133,"BUSH PIG RAH RAH RAH OH YEAH.  Nice browns boss.Soon boss, very soon, I will be out there. This warm weather has me chasing those green things still. Nice kill."
121954,Clampet,2007-10-09 23:22:00,1947,Hope the weather cooperates. Is Big Buck Bob going too?
122008,Deano,2007-10-10 00:53:00,767,"Be safe and have fun. Bring a BBQ with ya, there will be less moose and deer to carry out, Damn that's the hard part."
122126,TJQ,2007-10-10 13:06:00,7806,"  Yup  for the first time.... Big Buck Bob....  is coming to wonderland...  With any luck, he will never be the same...  Looks like the weather is turning... just in time!  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0439/"
122145,Clampet,2007-10-10 13:44:00,1947,"I do not know, but will these numbers be easy to surpass: 20 points, 243 lbs  Field Dressed."
122151,Jay T,2007-10-10 13:58:00,282,"Good luck T.J. 180gr will do for sure. I don't use a rifle, I use a 50 cal muzzleloader only for deer in the late season, if by chance I don't bag one with the bow. I use a 300gr bullet with a 100gr of powder pushing, lays the smack down on the deer no tracking just get the 4 wheeler and put it on  . Be safe and have a great trip, I look forward to your report."
122167,cityfisher,2007-10-10 14:44:00,959,nice pics ! I wish i was going to the moose hunting this coming week in 56......work didnt give me hte week off  .. But i did get a week for deer !  i shoot 7mm rem mag in 170gr...perfect for whatever comes my way.. shot placement does the killing in my books.  My buddy shot a nice bull last year with 150gr .308.. one shot through the lungs and 40 yards..went another 30 into the bush and dropped for good  !!...  Congrats on the bull tag ! ! we get one every 5-10 years in our area
122176,Entropy,2007-10-10 15:11:00,747,"Yep, someone was using this thread.  I don't think it supported there argument.  Cleaning it up right now.  Entropy  "
122199,Roy,2007-10-10 16:29:00,13728, It's not cleaned up it's just locked.  I guess it takes a while.
122200,TJQ,2007-10-10 16:30:00,7806, LOL.. No worries...
122203,Fishnfiend,2007-10-10 16:46:00,357,Good luck TJ.  Please post pics of the damage the 180 does on the bull.  It will not let you down.  I do have one question though - do you wear a camo tutu or pink so that you can be seen?
122205,Roy,2007-10-10 16:49:00,13728,TJ no longer wears a tutu out hunting.....ever since he got mistaken for an osterich.
122210,John,2007-10-10 17:08:00,2956,Osterich be dang'd............ these are his NY/NJ relatives!
122219,rickster,2007-10-10 17:43:00,495,Hey TJ good luck on the hunt. Where do you normally hunt? There reason I am asking is that picture with the sunrise along the rr tracks looks familiar. I live thirty km west of Fort Frances but moose hunt around the Mine Centre area  rickster
122252,Zib,2007-10-10 18:50:00,369,I love this time of the year. The problem this year is that its been too hot. This cool down will get those deer moving & I can look for this guy's papa that I seen last year:  
122253,TJQ,2007-10-10 18:56:00,7806, LOL... your pretty close... I better not catch you in my watch!! LOL...
122256,aplumma,2007-10-10 19:08:00,6896,Don't forget Thursday this thread turns into a lets give TJ the what fur since he will be gone for 2 weeks.  Art
122258,Roy,2007-10-10 19:11:00,13728,"I don't think so, Art. I'll be manning his pooter and drinking his beer."
122289,steve_paul,2007-10-10 21:11:00,658," Cool, party at TJ's    Good luck this year TJ, be safe and looking forward to the report (well except the guys in the sauna part at least)."
121541,TJQ,2007-10-08 14:09:00,7806,Shortly..... wait for it ... wait for it...  Soon Ill be off to Fort Frances with some of my best buds in the world.. (a few any way)  guys that understand tolerate  me ... for some of the best deer hunting moose shooting monster pike pickeral fishing duck hunting sauna taking  fire burning times Ill ever have.  but heres my dillemma....  lol...  I usually use a 180 grain bullet.. but was thinking about going down to a 150... however since we have a bull moose tag (shagariffic!!) I was thinking a 220 grain might be good to have around so then I'm thinking my 180 grain silvertip (in case of werewolves) would probably suffice since it is my standard ammo anyway and my gun is dead on with that size.... Now I used to use a 220 grain silvertip when they made them.... but it leaves a rather large hole on the other side of any deer I get... so my buddy made me stop using them.. but what if we see's our moose???   Heres some picks from past years....  just to get me going!!  The Camp...    The morning..    The Prize!!  (Hey Cliff... like my lucky tiara??)    The Boys!!       The Meal.    Time to do it all again!!!!  YEE HAA!!! Thank Jesus for rednecks!!
121543,danc,2007-10-08 14:13:00,4677,There's nothing like the anticipation of your best annual trip TJ. Have fun..
121544,Roy,2007-10-08 14:13:00,13728,"I think you should use the 180 grain silvertip. Personally, I use 1.5v coppertops. My only problem is that my ammo dies faster than my prey.  I'm really looking forward to the report. Just be safe out there Bud.  DANG! Duelling banjos is starting up in my head again...."
121545,Mike the Pike,2007-10-08 14:13:00,3421,Good Luck hunting TJ have to admit you lost me with the bullet techno stuff.YOu scared me at first I thought you got some snow.Have a great trip
121549,Handlebarz,2007-10-08 14:23:00,3790,have a blast BOSS cant wait for ya all to get back safe with another great report
121552,irishfield,2007-10-08 14:27:00,26272,"Play safe TJ. You're one of the best red necks we have, bud, and hate to have anything happen to you'all !"
121554,Mike Pike,2007-10-08 14:35:00,1332,I don't hunt myself but pics like that make me wish I did.  Have a safe and successful trip again this year Terry!
121555,Roy,2007-10-08 14:37:00,13728,Is Terry going too? Hell! I wasn't invited?
121557,Bly,2007-10-08 14:47:00,1556,"Haven't hunted since I was a kid and never did hunt for moose so I won't comment on the bullets. although I think the silver tip is a good idea (werewolves and all).   Have a great time, shoot lots and be safe!   Look forward to the report   Oh and the tiara is lovely lol"
121558,Ron,2007-10-08 14:49:00,1683,"Accuracy counts more than grains, in my books. A 180 grain will still stop a moose in it's tracks. Better than a 220 grain planted in the wrong killing zone. (just my opinion).  Have a great trip TJ, looking forward to the trip yet???"
121559,dustink,2007-10-08 14:55:00,526,Best of luck....and looking forward to the pics!!  dk
121567,fatherof3,2007-10-08 15:16:00,1769,"waiting is the hardest part,good luck on your trip"
121576,cisco,2007-10-08 15:36:00,597,"150 is more than enough for any size moose. But get a decent bullet. Nosler partition bullet or the Barnes brass deals hold together great and will punch through both shoulders without a huge hole.  Now the standard manufacturers are playing catchup on loading thess better bullets into their own cases. The manufacturers like Remington and Federal and Winchester have also improved their bullets so they hold together better. Ya get what you pay for and with the internet you can find out what hunters say and what the gun experts say about various commercial rounds.  Me, I've dropped a few moose with the Noslers in handloaded cases of different calibres and have done some tests shooting everything from gel blocks to .... nevermind and have never been disappointed in their performance.  Never shot the Barnes but have heard nothing but good about them from gun gurus.  Have a safe hunt 'Killer'. LOL!!!"
121581,Terry,2007-10-08 16:20:00,14456,well not this Terry   but if there's room......LOL    have fun  aim strait and use whatever gain you feel good about
121588,ccmtcanada,2007-10-08 16:44:00,7971,"LOL...looks like a great time TJ!  Good luck and be safe.  The tiara is the key to my success....doesn't look as good on you as it does me, but hey, you gotta start somewhere....LOL"
121596,OhioFisherman,2007-10-08 17:06:00,6623,"I don`t hunt TJ, but logic dictates it`s not the size of the bullet, but how well your aim is. Bigger hole less distance traveled after the hit? BxHxH=D? Have a good time!"
121600,TJQ,2007-10-08 17:16:00,7806, hahahaaha... i keep telling the wife that.. makes me feel better about myself...
121610,Daplumma,2007-10-08 17:32:00,1961,I think cicso is correct.A well place 150 grain bullet will take out whatever you want.What caliber are you using?I use a .270 150 grain federal and have had great results but I have not shot a moose with one.A few cows and 1 horse  but no mooses.You would think the farmers around here would put bells or saddles on their farm animals so they wouldn't be mis identified by hunters. Joe
121613,bigfish1965,2007-10-08 17:36:00,3382,I think if you use a gun you take all the sport out of it. Use a rope and a hockey stick on them moose. Toss a good lasso and whack him with the stick right across the shins. Pull his sweater over his head and beat him stupid. Dinner in no time! Now thats hunting!
121615,Fang,2007-10-08 17:41:00,1330,Anything above 150 will be fine. I shoot 7mm mag and have both 150 and 170. If you're gun is sighted in and set up on the 180 then stick with it. A 220 grain will drop significantly out past 200 yrds over the 180.
121616,aplumma,2007-10-08 17:49:00,6896,Hey T.J. If you see a bear in the woods make sure it is not a mirror before you shoot. Have a safe and fun time in camp bud.   Art
121643,TJQ,2007-10-08 19:33:00,7806," Oh you are a funny dude...   ""careful"" is my middle name   LOL.."
121646,huntervasili,2007-10-08 19:39:00,1604,"Good luck out there TJ... I know I'd shoot what I am most comfortable shooting and what the guns sighted in for... The placement is of course what counts the most and 150 grains is enough for the moose, Good luck with killing the trophy and I'll be waiting on a report"
121905,Bassloadingzone,2007-10-09 19:45:00,32,"I was reading on another site and some how this thread got throwin into it about how would this thread be appropriate if it was asians showing pictures like this. Check out Ontario Out Of Doors under the thread of Its not asians its their practices, The guy who is trying to make a point keeps getting called a hick, so I guess thats what the referance to this thread must be,lol"
121907,irishfield,2007-10-09 19:47:00,26272,Dang...I can hear the guns loading now....
