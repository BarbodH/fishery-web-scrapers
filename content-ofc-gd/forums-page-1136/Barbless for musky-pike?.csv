I've often wondered why we all don't go barbless to further help the fish survive. I fish some for pike and lakers with a fly rod, and always pinch down my barbs, and I have seldom lost a fish because of it. Keeping a tight line is mandatory, of course. Anyone have any thoughts on this?"

122428,Terry,2007-10-11 12:21:00,14456,I believe that barbless is (should be) the future of all catch and release fishing including all tourneys
122436,JFR,2007-10-11 13:03:00,498,Buy yourself a good set of bolt cutters such as Knipex.  I prefer cutting the hook.

122485,Musky or Specks,2007-10-11 15:06:00,2710,I keep a box of 5/0 and 6/0 trebles on board. I use my Beckman net as a liivewell and dont even try reversing the hooks out . I just use the bolt cutters and cut them off. Its not like I go through a box of hooks a day(although that would be awesome) I might have to do it 3 or 4 times on a good day.
