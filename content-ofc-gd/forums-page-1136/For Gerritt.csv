122402,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-11 08:12:00,1183," Thank you.  Terrance Gerritt William is a strong name for your little man....just remember that his eyes in this picture that you have shared with us don't have that look anymore, he was in good spirits because he was being loved and he had no fear.   I hurt for you and your wife and I can't imagine the sadness that comes over you but I know the joy that you feel when you believe that you most definitely will be with him again....because you will."
