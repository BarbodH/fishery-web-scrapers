122223,dsn,2007-10-10 17:56:00,1018,"I think it was more fun taking photos than fishing for these fish!! Check it out.           Then I took pics from another angle. It revealed a surprise.      A closer look at the photo above... revealed this,..next photo below!!   What's he doing in there? Does he think he's a salmon as well?      Well that's all, too bad it clouded over. With out the bit of sun I would't have been able to even spot the rainbow. All the fish look black.  dsn"
122224,ccmtcanada,2007-10-10 17:58:00,7971,WOW!!! Superb shots DSN!!!

122227,Joey,2007-10-10 18:06:00,9122,"Wow, neat.  How many tries did it take them to make it?  Joey"
122234,Fang,2007-10-10 18:14:00,1330,"The surprise fish looks like a Brown to me. Lots of spots and darker color for a rainbow.  If so he or she is doing just what the salmon are doing, going to spawn."

122332,highdrifter,2007-10-10 23:34:00,2534,"Very kewl!  I stop and look every time I'm in those parts...  I was actually volunteering with Ontario Streams back in 1999, when they notched the first wear there.  We knotched the last wear in 2004 at Cruikshank Park.  Makes it all worth while when I look at those shots...  Let's hope those fish reach suitable spawning grounds and we get a natural return from them.  cheers! HD"
