121765,Crazyhook,2007-10-09 04:05:00,1154,Lew  she is still working!!! A new confidence fall bait!
121766,irishfield,2007-10-09 04:08:00,26272, No it's not... I know the river...
121781,Rich Clemens,2007-10-09 10:03:00,3131,Man ... that is one sweeeet fish.  Congrats on the win.
121785,lew,2007-10-09 11:00:00,12767, Sounds like you've become a definate convert Jamie  Do we have any pictures ??
121789,Rich Clemens,2007-10-09 11:15:00,3131,"While up on the French in September, we stopped by Lakair one afternoon for a visit with Kevin and Leslie.  The bite was off and Kevin said he caught a couple nice pike using the Suick along the rocks of the store lines.  So, having a couple myself, we gave them a shot.  Caught one pike, not of great size, but with our luck, we'd take anything.  Last year, my wife threw one into the shore line and something of nice size went after it, just as it hit the water.  Unfortunately, the fish missed the bait and never to be seen again.  Definitely a bait that I will be spending more time with for next year's trips."
121791,lew,2007-10-09 11:28:00,12767," Their an excellent bait Rich, specially the larger 9"" weighted version, and definetely good for fall and the cooler water when the fish are slowing down.  I add extra weights to even the weighted ones and it makes them nearly neutral buoyant when sitting still, and they then become almost irresistible to a hungry musky lookin for some dinner.  Let them sit for a minute, then give em a twitch and hang on"
114504,Crazyhook,2007-09-17 01:09:00,1154,"Fished a small tournament today in Ottawa and things were not going our way to start, motor busted, fish finder friend, forgot the net.  well my luck would change and casting some deep water I see a big fish come behind my bait.  I have been talking down to suicks and giving Lew a hard time but today I gave them an honest try.  after hooking this baby on a figure 8 I may throw it some more  Lew I am sorry for doubting your bait    won the biggest musky in the tournament! some cash, some baits and a gift certificate"
