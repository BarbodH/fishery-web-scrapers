Racing is a progressive sport. Not come out with all this technology only too run at a even pace. This is a poor adaption of what I think racing should be. They don't start racing till their is a hand full of laps left.  This is a joke, right.  I would rather watch a 80's race with 20 cautions."
121727,Daplumma,2007-10-09 00:00:00,1961,I'm with you bud..was a real snoozefest.Drivin in circles hoping yer junk dont blow up till after the checkers.The COT on a plate track is crap. Joe
121734,Mike Pike,2007-10-09 00:26:00,1332,All restrictor plate races are boring.  You can't blame this one on the COT.
121738,irishfield,2007-10-09 00:41:00,26272,Bring back the wing cars....  
121748,mooseroo,2007-10-09 01:45:00,80,Bring back racing the requires more than a left hand turn!
121751,F7Firecat,2007-10-09 01:57:00,347,"yep 20 laps in I turned it off, watched the last 20 laps and thats it.  nascar seems to be going into the pooper if you ask me.  F7"
121762,lookinforwalleye,2007-10-09 03:16:00,4399,I have too agree I used to be a die hard Nascar fan but I now find the majority of races to be very boring but I could always count on Talledega for some great racing but after what I saw yesterday I may be down to one race a year Daytona lets hope they don`t screw that up.
121769,MuskyBill,2007-10-09 05:05:00,311,"Kinda funny, weren't we all thinking this after the 'other' great race of the year, the Bristol night race??  I know I was kinda disappointed with that one, & now this one too??"
121780,misfish,2007-10-09 09:46:00,29133,"Yep no chance of the big one happening with the COT.LOL  BORING.   Wayne sweet ride bud. Hey look,theres a turkey in the field.LOL"
121834,wallyboss,2007-10-09 15:00:00,1095,"I also used to be a Die Hard Nascar Fan, but ever since they started the Chase to the Cup, I can count on 1 hand the races I have watched.  And I agree the Restrictor plates races are boring now."
