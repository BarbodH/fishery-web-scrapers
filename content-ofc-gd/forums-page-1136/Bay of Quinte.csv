121625,bucktail,2007-10-08 18:35:00,1857,Might be a it to early to open water troll the area past the ferry in Picton. In that area use inline boards and deep diving cranckbaits to hit the big open water eyes as they return to the bay in the fall. Best bet might be working the resident fish in areas around Mallory Bay and Telegraph Narrows. Most residnt fish are weed related so try working deep weedlines with crankbaits and swimbaits in 8-14 feet of water. You will pick up lots of incidental largemouth and pike. If you are planning on using 3 way rigs use berkley gulp worms to avoid the constant rebaiting due to gobies and perch.  D
121627,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-08 18:40:00,835,Best way is to get yourself a chart and most of the spots will be obvios and if you show it to someone they can point out where the fish are biting.

I hate to be the one to inform you what equipment to use since I own a hunting and fishing store and I do not want to have anybody think that I am promoting my products.  If you do not get much of a response on here (and I am confident that you will) then send me a PM and I will be pleased to assist you.  Best regards, Sam"
122118,Corey,2007-10-10 12:35:00,355,I say go see Sam. He'll get ya hooked up and in the right direction. He's been kind to every OFC'r who has gone to his place.
