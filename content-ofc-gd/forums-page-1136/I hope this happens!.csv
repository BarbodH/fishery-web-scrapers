121812,Fishnfiend,2007-10-09 13:45:00,357,"I guess you aren't chasing whitetails this year?  It is too frigg'n hot for that.  Bring on the cold. One more day of rain should supply sufficient water for the fish.  Then, just cool, crisp autumn days are welcomed."
121813,lew,2007-10-09 13:52:00,12767,"A huge downpour just went thru here about 30 minutes ago.  Good for the streams I spose, but bad for me.....I just found out my eavestroughs need cleaning. Oh well, I guess now I know what I'm doin this afternoon."
121815,fishindevil,2007-10-09 13:55:00,6254,"Well we still need more rain than that,the rivers & lakes are still at record low levels,even the creeks are really low for this time of year...i hope we get lots of rain,the forests need it too,and so do all those steelhead"
