122296,urbanangler1990,2007-10-10 21:27:00,933,"if it wasnt for toskala it would have been 15 - 1, he gave up when the damn defence did, they r screwd"
122301,ecxstriper,2007-10-10 21:40:00,343, And you can always go out fishing if the leafs are losing . Looks like you being getting alot of night fishing in this year!!
122306,dsn,2007-10-10 21:58:00,1018, 
122312,kemper,2007-10-10 22:26:00,2232,"I have come up with a master plan to pay for my fishing addiction.  If i bet 1000 on every leafs game, im bound to be up money when they finish below .500..."
122317,JohnF,2007-10-10 22:46:00,3494," But cut him off from chewing the ice cubes. They induce brain freeze at less than opportune moments, and that leads to penalty kills, and we know where those lead.  Toronto needs to trade some bulk for some speed. The Sundin line looks good if Blake is okay to play. The new goalie looks promising but can't do it all alone back there.  A couple of defensive d's would be nice. Offensive dee is great but not when you're on defense most of the time because you're being outskated, outsmarted and outnumbered. As much as I like the grit from guys like McCabe and Tucker (and I liked Domi even better) I'm afraid they're too costly with their giveaways and penalties and the Leafs would do better with a couple of different players with better hands, better judgement and consistent awareness.  Don't get me wrong. I'm a long time Leafs fan, even when they're losing. I can't help getting my hopes up going into the end of the regular season every year, hoping against hope that they pull off some miracle on ice, knowing no rabbit will be coming out of any hat. I stick with the playoffs to the bitter end but it's never the same once the Leafs have gone golfing.  YMMV JF"
122339,jedimaster,2007-10-11 00:16:00,3472,No Defense         No Playoffs
122361,bowshep,2007-10-11 01:32:00,378,l saw 2 games at the ACC before the strike and havent watched hockey on tv since. l watched Antipof*#%$ float all game l have seen water baloons more durible than him. The leafs are slackers. The best Leaf hockey l had seen then never made it to the play offs but no team wanted to play them because they would be in a big hurt with all the checks and board grinding. The Leafs dont have Heart or Grit and until they do l would rather watch Figure Skating at least they try to win. Peace Ken
120451,xrap,2007-10-03 23:11:00,683,Leafs and sens tonight wooot. GO LEAFS GO!!! And allt he fantasy players in the OFC pool get ready to lose boyZ!!!!!!!!!!!!
120484,holdfast,2007-10-04 00:59:00,1813,Yup and Mtl also.  Im so dissipointed though that they let go Sourey and signed Markov and drafted even more Europeans.  Well another season of crap hockey.
120490,carll2,2007-10-04 01:09:00,443,yesss finally that time of the year and this time i got smart and ordered all the nhl chanells so i dont miss a game   may the leafs have a good year and the habs  also!
120503,carp-starter,2007-10-04 01:45:00,253,"I sure do know what it means.  Come spring time, the Leafs will reach 42 years without a Stanley Cup.  On TV news, the Leafs are basically the laughing stock and the hope is that at least the Leafs get into the final 8 teams.  Look at the goalie position. The Leafs are looking for a ""good"" goalie. I am not too sure but I would guess that they have problems at all positions. A situation like this does not allow a team to win the Stanley Cup.  Oh well, it will be another year for ""rebuilding"".  Correct me if I am wrong. I think the HABS have won the Cup 9 times since the last time the Leafs have won the CUP.   No wonder the HABS go   and the Leafs go golfing.  carp-starter"
120552,xrap,2007-10-04 03:13:00,683," Nobody said anything..... But now I have to say it,I don't care how amny times you won the cup I don't care when you won the cup in my eyes you will always suck because I am a leaf fan and it will never change. Leafs lsot a tough game tonight that they should of had. Round 2 in Ottawa tommrow .. boo yah GO LEAFS GO!!!!"
120563,sturgman,2007-10-04 07:23:00,249, You mean theres actually an OFC hockey Fantasy pool that I can join? Sign me up!!
120572,xrap,2007-10-04 10:45:00,683,  Too late.. it was on the board quite sometime. Sorry
120597,pigeonfisher,2007-10-04 12:32:00,696,"At about 9:45 I was ready to plan the parade route...then they lost, again!"
120637,lookinforwalleye,2007-10-04 15:00:00,4399,"  The habs did not let #44 go they made him a good offer he decided he would take his career -27 stat and play for Edmonton.  And for the record Montreal drafted 1 european last year and that was in the 6th round I just wish they would start drafting some europeans like Malkin,Ovechkin,etc.   And by the way was that Raycroft in net last nite watching pucks go through his legs? LOL"
120638,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-10-04 15:02:00,39,That was quite the pee wee team Toronto iced last night LoL. Leafs need to find a real goalie maybe they should have gone after Gerber ? Can't be the money Toronto sells out every game.They finally realized that they have to develop players not just buy washed up oldtimers.I love this rivalry and it will only get better.I hate to say it but looks like Toronto is going to keep the playoff streak alive....3yrs straight !! Go Sens Go  AAAAhhhh REALITY
120640,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-04 15:03:00,698,I worked for the leafs for 8 years in the front office as technical analyst. I have the blue and white in my blood. Hopefully they can prove the doubters wrong this year. You never know
120643,lickmyarmpit,2007-10-04 15:32:00,359,"Leafs sens habs they are all crap, lets go red wings!"
120647,jedimaster,2007-10-04 16:14:00,3472,The leafs will go no where remember this thread they will again be battling for the LAST playoff spot. I mean make a big trade for a goalie and bench him the first game? How retarded. Better to save him the preasure and put him in his first game against the Sens on the road where he will get completly shell shocked.  The leafs made no improvement in there biggest flaw from the last 5 years. No defense. They have good offensive defensemen but only 1 good defensive defensemen. It showed game after game last year and already crept up in the pre season and now in regular season.  I am calling the leafs to finish no better than 7th. likely 10th. Hopefuly at least 8th.  The unfortunate side is I will end up watching or listenening to most of the 82 games again this year in agony.
120656,Mike Pike,2007-10-04 17:13:00,1332,I believe they went golfing at the same time last year.
120677,tonyb,2007-10-04 19:36:00,1637," I'm with you jedimaster, I'll be watching and whining but that's what being a Leafs fan is all about.  One of these years, they'll win the Cup and I can say I've stuck with my team through it all.  None of this bangwagon hopping nonsense  Tony"
120834,blaque,2007-10-05 13:07:00,2419,"Thatta boy Tony. I agree. Ive stuck with my Sabres since my dad got me hooked when i was a little kid. Lord knows weve been thru some hardships, and Ive had to patch a few holes in the wall thru the years.....and clean some beer off my TV screen , etc...........but ya put it behind ya, and ya get fired up for the next season the same as the one before..........It would suck to win stanley cups every season. lol How pointless would that get? Itll be that much sweeter the day your team wins Lord Stanleys cup. With Buffalos success last year.........you should have seen the Fair Weather fans pop up around here last year. No doubt its fun to see the area all hopped up on the local team, but you know darn well that if they slip even a little this year that most of those folks will fall off the wagon, put their jerseys they bought and wore once last year cuz they won a playoff ticket back in the closet, take their car flags off, etc....  Side Note: Briere looked good in Calgary last night, 2 goals, including the game winner. Little Prick LOL"
120856,urbanangler1990,2007-10-05 14:17:00,933,"lets remember ottawa is a much superior team, i think we held our own, only 1 goal difference, not bad... go leafs"
120864,jedimaster,2007-10-05 14:36:00,3472,"Well it seemed like the leafs of every year to me. Both games they had good spurts and weak D. They have always been able to be dominant over one or two periods but they have never been able to keep good teams down and out of a close game.  I don't want to sound like a hater, as I bleed blue and white. but man it sure seems like year after year they give up for half the game winning or losing."
120996,bassmaster4,2007-10-05 19:36:00,801,the leafs play well up until the third period then everything starts to fall apart they need to play a full 60 minutes and stop trying to kill off the third most of the time it wont work especially against a team like ottawa dont get me wrong i like the leafs but thats what screws them over most games
122220,RobHall,2007-10-10 17:45:00,261, Nice game against the Hurricanes last night.  That new goalie looks like quite the pickup.  I think missing the PO's 3 years in a row is a real possibility.  FOTB 
122222,Wes Bender,2007-10-10 17:56:00,105,Here is how we fix the Leafs. We feed them the same breakfast Tucker eats everyday. Nails and rebar!
122251,lookinforwalleye,2007-10-10 18:49:00,4399,That was a nice play by McCabe going around the net LOL what a waste of money.  The biggest mystery to me is how this guy JFJ who signed these bozo`s still has his job.
122254,lookinforwalleye,2007-10-10 19:00:00,4399,  Nails and rebar that would explain his lack of speed. LOL
122257,addy79,2007-10-10 19:10:00,573,"ferguson is a tool, he will be out by end of season.  leafs blowas usual, and yes i am a fan, big part of the blame has to go to the t.o. fans, dont support crappy teams or they stay...crappy!  i've gone to every game at the acc/mlg for the past 13 years, not this year, i cant support a team that cares more about money than winning.  i'll watch from home, a lot less painful"
122259,ccmtcanada,2007-10-10 19:14:00,7971, Beer doesn't cost $7.00 and the lineups at the bathroom aren't as bad either.
