121824,ccmtcanada,2007-10-09 14:14:00,7971,"Brian....wow!!! What an amazing report.  6 pounder...congrats on the new PB!  When I have a big fish on, I do the same thing you did...talk to myself...LOL.  I say ""keep the tip up....don't horse it.....know which direction the fish is going....damn...keep that tip up!!!"""
121852,Golfisher,2007-10-09 15:54:00,586,A thing of beauty for sure!
121854,Spiel,2007-10-09 16:05:00,9065,....Sweet fish Brian. That elusive six lb mark has still eluded me. Plenty of fives but no cigar as they say.
121595,misfish,2007-10-08 17:03:00,29133,"  As the title says,I finally got my personal best and now belong to the six pound club  Left the Barrie Marina 7am along. Since the BPS touneys location has been changed I thought I would hit the eastside. The winds were out of the west and light so I figured it was a good time to head over that way. Just as I get past BBP,there was left over south rollers still out there,but was still managable to get across.Headed to a couple of humps I have fished before. Took a bit to find them as the coordinates were on my old gps that went in the drink a couple years back. Once I found them I started to work a tube with 1/2 onuce jig and aswell as a dropshot. This boat approaches and Im thinking to myself,what does this head want. As he gets closer ,he says hows it going Brian,I say who you? Marcal,hey dude what up.Marcel is MART,from the board here.    After a chat and some conversing on spots,we both went on our way.Nice to see you again Marcel.  Ok down to fishing again. Head up to Georgina Island.Worked a few drop off and rock piles but fish were small.      After an hour of throwing the tube I decided to hit an area that works for me and there again I found small fish.      Thinking that with the warmer then norm temps,maybe the fish are still in thier summer pattern   .I had been very hesitant to use my lucky craft lure, but went with it and thats when my day was made. Moved in to 10 fow and started to chuck the craft. Wham fish on.Nice 3 pound chunk,next cast. I start to jerk it back to the boat, I can see the lure and this black thing moving behind it. Stop,twitch and bam,fish on. It took like seemed to be 10 minutes to get this fish to the boat. I knew it was big and didnt want to horse it in. 1 jump 2 jumps and I knew I had a fish of a life time on.So with me muddering to myself ,easy easy,take your time,I get the fish to the boat,in the net and YES,it a tank.My PB and I know belong to the 6 pound club. Awesome just awesome. I may not be smiling,but I was shaking.LOL      On my way back in I came a cross a herum of cormarands. There had to be over 500 of them. The vid isnt the best but I did get close enough to them to smell thier stench.PHEW.  http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v731/mis...allies07010.flv  Thanks for reading"
121597,bucktail,2007-10-08 17:07:00,1857,Way to go Brian!  Funny I was just about to PM you to see how you did! Seems like they are still in summer patterns but this weather this week might just change that.  D

121645,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-08 19:38:00,0,Congrats on the PB and judging by the dark colours I would say that fish has been staying pretty shallow! Looks like its gonna be a great Tournament with alot of big weights!
