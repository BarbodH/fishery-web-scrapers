Drifted across from around 27' and that's when we got better sizes.   Marked lots of baitfish, you can actually see them near the surface.  Threw the jig right at them, let it sink quickly and whamm, big ones just below them.  If you can follow the bait clouds, ur into some big ones.  We saw the anchored boat using minnows catching perch on the small side though, but fun none the less."
