121829,bbog,2007-10-09 14:54:00,665,"Was up at my favourite fishing hole in the Parry Sound area this past weekend. Spent most of my fishing time trolling the shorelines in my canoe, looking for whatever would bite. Usually it is decent Smallies and lots of small Pike. This weekend wasn't much different.  After a while of fishing I decided to cross the lake to visit one of my friends. I didn't pull up the line and made the trip across with a gold and black jointed Walleye Diver. 2/3rds of the way across I have a light pull on the line (a spot that is about 30' deep). Pull the rod from the rod holder and pull up this.    No fight from this 15.5"" 2lb personal best.  A couple of days later I think why not try finding the suspending Crappie and make the crossing again. In about the same spot (using a similar Bass/Pike lure) I find another couple of decent Crappie. The smallest of the twins put up the biggest fight of the three.    These two were smaller at around 13 and 14 inches. Can't wait to have my Thanksgiving Crappie dinner!"
121838,Riparian,2007-10-09 15:10:00,269,Nice slabs Barnie
121845,Mike Pike,2007-10-09 15:33:00,1332,Me thinks you just stumbled across a pattern for some real slabs there.  Finding Crappie at anytime other than spring is really difficult for me so congratz to ya!

121887,Zib,2007-10-09 18:35:00,369,Wow! Those are some fatties. Nice job.
121895,Fang,2007-10-09 18:56:00,1330,You defintiely have a traditional fall pattern for Crappie. get the GPS out and make it a waypoint. Hit that spot in the winter through the ice
122158,bbog,2007-10-10 14:30:00,665,"Thanks to everyone for all the kind words.  Fang, I'll try to get out again in the next several weeks to see if I can establish a better location. I was trolling so a GPS waypoint wouldn't give me an accurate spot. It is however a small lake and I have a pretty good idea where I got them. I'll be bringing my depth finder next trip and try jigging - if successful then take a GPS reading for ice fishing purposes (if I actually take up ice fishing). Appreciate your advice.  Thanks, Barn"
122288,mikeymikey,2007-10-10 21:05:00,376,Very very nice!  So that is what a quality slab is.  From the first picture... first thing that got my eyes were your facial expression.
122294,wuchikubo,2007-10-10 21:24:00,1114,Very Nice Slabs! WTG on your PB crappie.
