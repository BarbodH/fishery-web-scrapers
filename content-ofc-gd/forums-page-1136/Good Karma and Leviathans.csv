121604,GbayGiant,2007-10-08 17:20:00,1780,"Cograts on the amazing trip, more muskies than most guys catch in a life time.  I like that hand shot of Dans 52"" it does show the real size of these girls."
121634,lew,2007-10-08 19:00:00,12767,"Absolutely outstanding Wayne !!  You waited a long time for this trip and it was certainly worth it.  Congratulations to both you & Dano on each getting your 1st ever muskies, and then the pair of youz joining the 50"" club on your 1st attempt.  Kudos to you too Marc, for doing what you do so well, you've put alot of smiles on the faces of alot of anglers."
121759,irishfield,2007-10-09 02:54:00,26272,"Thanks everyone. Cropped the two 50's and the 46"" fish for head shots...as I think they're pretty neat. Dano's looks like a bronze statue."
121902,Squid,2007-10-09 19:35:00,1656,Have to say that those are beautiful fish Wayne and Dano. Amazing numbers and I just love those under water shots. Great report!!!
121906,irishfield,2007-10-09 19:45:00,26272,"Thanks Pete!  I'd also like to add for those looking to get into Muskie fishing, like I did a couple years back..skunked to this point.... that I highly recommend a trip like this, or fishing with someone really comfortable with them to show you the right way to net, photo and release these wonderful fish. No where near as wild as I thought they'd be once netted. They tend to calm right down, like ""get this over with and let me swim""...unlike a pike that generally goes nuts in a net.  Any fish shown in this threads photos, in the boat, were only there for 15 to 20 seconds. Fish just stays in submerged net after removing the hooks (hooks removed with fish under water in net) and with Marc once you lift it out you get 2 quick shots before it goes back. Cameras turned on...fish comes up out of net..2 quick shots and right back into the water for the smaller ones and into the cradle and back in the water for bigger ones so they can be measured and then slowly released back to the depths. No measuring in the boat....he doesn't even bother with girth measurements and there wasn't a tape anywhere in the boat either. Just the measurement strip on the Frabil floating cradle."
121909,bigbuck,2007-10-09 20:01:00,2449,"MONSTERS!!!!! Run for your lives!!!! Jeez, those are very, very nice 'skis!!! I've heard stories from a reliable source about the Larry and now I am seeing actual proof. I guess if you really want size AND numbers, that's the place to go!!! Congrats on your PBs."
121226,Crazyhook,2007-10-06 16:08:00,1154,awesome report guys! some beauty fish and good times  Nice to see the Steeples still producing
121230,cisco,2007-10-06 16:47:00,597,"Very enjoyable read fellas! Congrats on several fantastic accomplishments and excellent pictures to capture the trip!  Funny how weird stuff jumps up to try and counter a perfect trip.  Imagine someone being loopy enough to do what that dummy on the road did! Good for him you're still young and still have quick reflexes and a good set of wheels, eh Wayne!  "
121242,Spiel,2007-10-06 19:31:00,9065,"  ....LOL, now that's funny. I think I did something just as ""odd"" the first time I had a musky follow.   Great report guys. Nothing like the rewards of ""good karma""."
121267,irishfield,2007-10-06 22:51:00,26272,"Thanks everyone, we did have a riot during our time in Montreal. Marc is a class act to fish with and keeps a close eye on things. I'm not sure how many times he said ""wait...your hooks are hung up"" as both of us were casting. Not many would pay attention like that and he NEVER picked up a rod, to fish, even though we told him to fish with us.  Here's a nice head shot of my 50 incher.  "
121274,mattyk,2007-10-06 23:44:00,2110,"wow! Great report, thanks for sharing your trip with us. I think it was good Karma."
121286,bpsbassman,2007-10-07 00:23:00,941,"I saw this post this morning before going to work.  Its about all I could think and talk about at Bass Pro today. Finally got to read the words and details.  What an awesome trip!! Truly a trip of a lifetime.  It will be really hard to duplicate (but fun trying).  Marc once again proves what a master he is.  Wayne, it made my day seeing you holding those pigs.  Those are real keeper photos.  I remember all those virgin lures you had when I was up at your place.  Did you get to use your own equipment??  Lord knows you've got some of the best unused equipment on the planet Could not have happened to a better guy. Congrats to you also Dano.  Looks like maybe you had a good time too One of the best and most gratifying reports ever on OFC. Way to go guys!"
121296,tbayboy,2007-10-07 00:49:00,1497,"What a great report.  Lived up to all the hype - been waiting for this since the teaser a few days back .  Marc sounds like an amazing guide and those fish are just amazing, congrats on a well earned perfect trip guys."
121297,irishfield,2007-10-07 00:54:00,26272,"Thanks Roger. I took my own rods/reels for casting.... as I prefer to reel left handed. Spiels custom Loomis 7'7"" rod/Cabo 31 combo brought all the casting fish in, except for the one I had on with Roy's homemade bait and that was my 6'9 St Croix and TE401 combo. Most of those ""virgin"" baits you saw have scratches in them now..... and the ones that don't will be getting a good work out in the next few weeks on GBay."
121307,Moosebunk,2007-10-07 02:25:00,3970,"Holy doods, that one blew my head off.  Yes, Wayne and Dan, good Karma... and it couldn't have happened to two nicer gents.  Great, great fish and report."
121317,Zib,2007-10-07 03:12:00,369,Awesome pictures!  I like Roy's green lure with the dots. Where can I get me one of those? I'd like to use it in LSC.
121319,irishfield,2007-10-07 03:15:00,26272," Custom made by Roy, Zib !"
121322,Zib,2007-10-07 03:20:00,369, Does he sell them?
121323,irishfield,2007-10-07 03:24:00,26272,"You'd have to send him a PM, Zib, and ask."
121371,Roy,2007-10-07 13:10:00,13728,"What a great report and super pics too! It's really nice to hear of folks having such a good time fishing. I guess with all of those fish it's a no brainer as to what you're having for Thanksgiving dinner, eh?  It was truly a pleasure meeting up with you guys. KNOW that either of you is welcome at my house anytime. Also, on Pepsi and cola you're both a cheap date  :-) Hugs from J."
121383,Whopper,2007-10-07 14:07:00,2174,An amazing report!  Truely awesome experience that I'm sure will stick in the old memory bank.  Kudos to everyone involved
121390,irishfield,2007-10-07 14:21:00,26272, Yep...had to have it yesterday so it didn't go bad and so we can get the daughter back to Ottawa Roy!
121426,TennesseeGuy,2007-10-07 18:24:00,957,"You guys had a beauty of an outing and the report was great.  Nice going Wayne, Dan and Marc.  Those release shots were great.  Thanks."
121459,HTHM,2007-10-07 22:59:00,4082,I wanna go next year!
121473,Ron,2007-10-08 01:08:00,1683,"Now that is just some incredible fishing! It almost seemed like it was going to be another one of those days Marc and Steve Bedarf had!  I can relate to having days with numbers put in the boat but can only imagine the days of putting numbers of BIG fish in the boat!  Well done to the both, no, three, no, 5 of you!!!  Dano, congrats on your personal best, truly a trip you will soon not forget! (I'll shoot you off another PM seeing as how I read what you have been up to lately now!)  Irishfield, and you want to know what the membership fee is for the 50 inch club = HA HA HA!!! Good on ya bud, couldn't think of a nicer guy to be in it! Again, truly a trip you will soon not to forget!  Marc, my hats off to you bud, you really know your stuff. Only have met you a couple of times and for short periods at that, you never cease to amaze me! The knowledge you have on these fine specimens called muskie, is second to none! I sometimes think you sleep with them just to get on their good side! LOL  Roy and who I have never met ""J"", every time I hear of someone heading down your way, I read the thread on how great of a time they have had. Can you say as you would blame them! Great hospitality and friendships like that are a tough to beat! I am certain you completed Dan and Wayne's fishing trip, even if they only caught a few shakers!  Now THAT""S a trip of a lifetime!"
121495,ehg,2007-10-08 04:06:00,2666,"That is an incredible fishing trip! Those fish must have been powerhouses. Thanks for taking the time to post this possible trip of a lifetime.  cheers,  ehg"

121560,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-08 14:57:00,0,WOW! Another impressive fishing adventure! Some of those shots of the fish in the water show exactly how thick those fish really are! Massive with big heads!
121156,Chuck Best,2007-10-06 10:04:00,308,"Great news Wayne,I'm glad to hear that your trip finally became a reality and you had a good time.Kudos for Mark putting you guys on so many fish .Great report and pics ....Thx......TC and tight lines.....Chuck....."
121158,Rich Clemens,2007-10-06 10:22:00,3131,I hate you guys.  All that musky action makes me sick.       That truely would be the trip of a lifetime and there is good reason for those smiles that run from ear to ear.   Great job guys and thanks for sharing your adventure.  Simply amazing.

121163,Marc Thorpe,2007-10-06 11:07:00,621,"another turning point, a fork stuck in the road Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go So make the best of this test, and don't ask why It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial For what it's worth it was worth all the while  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.   Dan and Wayne,thanks for the wonderful time and great laughs,trully a karma moment To Roy and J,once again you surpassed the heights of welcomeness and filling out tummies Nice to see OFC members,band together and come to the aid of others The recipe to Karma  may God shine on you all,trully a dissplay of kindesss in aiding others"
121166,dustink,2007-10-06 11:34:00,526,"Congrats Wayne & Dano!!!   Wow....some great fish there and looks like a trip that will be remembered for a long time!  Good Karma indeed, and well deserved.  dk"

121169,Musky or Specks,2007-10-06 11:47:00,2710,Wow musky fishing like that can only be dreamed about. Congrats on what looked like an amazing trip.
121170,Dano,2007-10-06 11:57:00,719,"I must say this was one of the finest trips I've ever been on, fishing or otherwise. I wasnt sure what to expect as it has been many years since I've been to Quebec and I have never fished for musky.  The Montreal area really surprised me with its fishing opportunities seemingly around every corner. Marc told me how many species were available just in the Ottawa and Larry and it just blew me away. It was really cool seeing the sturgeon jumping out of the water all around us and the ocean freighters passing by.  The fishing was off the hook (as were many musky that I missed!) the first follow I had up to the boat caught me off guard, I just froze and said, ""There's a fish...."" Marc or Wayne, I cant remember which, probably both said, ""Well, do something dummy, dont just stand there breathing through your mouth!"" So I scared it away!!  I never did entice any boatside followers to hit, but Wayne did. I decided that I like to hook my fish away from the boat anyway so I have more line to reel in......  Casting was my preferred way to catch these fish, I guess it made me feel a little more in control and it gave me something to do, plus feeling these fish smash the bait was out of this world, nevermind the powerful runs they would make, with most of my fish breaking water.  Marc is an excellent guide and a nice guy, unfortunately there was no one around for him to follow, so he had to find his own spots   . We had a lot of fun, but you have to fish hard, which was fine by me. He truly knows his stuff and has put in monster amounts of time on the water developing his portfolio of hot musky spots, so please dont ask.  Already looking forward to next year, these fish get under your skin, they should have cigarette pack like warnings on every musky- Caution- extremely addictive! lol  Again, thanks to Wayne for this opportunity, you are a good friend. Thanks to Marc for the unreal fishing and laughs and Roy and J for your hospitality, this is a trip I will remember for the rest of my life."
