121825,shoreman4,2007-10-09 14:32:00,8,hey hey hey guys i have been fishing alot around lake o lately and always release the fish i catch out of it. I do this because i have been told it is not healthy to eat the fish out of it but by others i have been told it is ok. just wanted some opinions to this.......
121830,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-09 14:55:00,698,Here's the guide to eating ontario sport fish. Also do a search as this has been discussed before.  http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/envision/guide/   Cheers
121833,ketchenany,2007-10-09 15:00:00,3229,"Here we go a again, get a copy of ""Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish""  2007-2008 which I completed not to long ago. It has all of the information you require on consumption limits of most species.  Hope this helps"
121836,Riparian,2007-10-09 15:09:00,269,"dont eat spawning salmon from the creek if thats what you are asking.  If it looks like its rotting from the outside in, dont eat it."
121848,Mike Pike,2007-10-09 15:36:00,1332,"Use 'The Guide,' as others have said Shoreman4 and then make your own choices.  Ya, and like Riparian said, it's pretty easy NOT to choose the Salmon in the river now as most are in a state of decay."
