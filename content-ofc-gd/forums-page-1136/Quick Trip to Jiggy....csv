It was also Monique and I's 24th aniversary of our first date (women..  I cant remember the last time I changed my shorts.. but she remembers that date....)  Anyway it rained all day sat so we didnt do any hunting or fishing so nothing to report there... a pretty quite weekend... although we did have surf and turf to celebrate.. then we played crib...   lol...
