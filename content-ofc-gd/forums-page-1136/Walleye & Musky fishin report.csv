121777,solopaddler,2007-10-09 09:05:00,8605,Considering the conditions sounds like a pretty good day to me. Well done!
121790,evster,2007-10-09 11:22:00,367,Good to see you guys were getting some fish.  Too bad the musky was too camera shy to get into the boat for a photo  .
121820,ccmtcanada,2007-10-09 14:05:00,7971,Sounded like tough conditions all right!  At least you managed to boat some fish...and those muskies REALLY sounded like they didn't want to come aboard you boat!  Done with the Kawarthas and onto Quinte?  That's where you really shine Shawn!! Go get 'em this year!
121931,ecmilley,2007-10-09 21:58:00,2163,"it was a tough go, with all those toothy critters around as well as the cold front that came through Saturday night, but they did start biting again Monday afternoon, but all fish i got monday came jigging, and once i found them(about 20 yards from my dock) they stayed pretty active untill i unintentionally went swimming"
