121771,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-09 05:10:00,835,"Grandmother said they killed them all off for a reason, they can do a lot of crop damage and they don't like bright colored mopars. My cousin painted an early 70's car and had it outside ready to pick up and a turkey pecked the ell out of it, didn't like the color, so don't trust them around the car."
