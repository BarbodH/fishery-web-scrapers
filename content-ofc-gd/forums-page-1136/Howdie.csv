Goodluck, as I know it can be a bit overwhelming at first.  You mentioned you need help with your knots.  Here's a site that I go to that reeeeeeeally helps with all the various fishing knots.  It's animated and moves as fast( or slow )as you make it.  I rely on it regularly.  http://www.animatedknots.com  Cheers!"
