121865,keram,2007-10-09 17:07:00,585,"Went with my son this time  . In his busy schedule he’s managed to get full day of fishing with me. The weather on Sunday was so-so. Windy, low clouds and a drizzle from time to time. Easterly wind  ( 15-20 km/h) and cold front condition, it did not look promising  . Anyway we were on the water by 7:30 am. First two hrs not even a sniff, all my go to lures did not produce anything. I was “little” bit disappointed  , because I have  only handful of chances to fish with my son ( about 3 times a year ). After two unproductive hrs we’ve moved to different part of the lake and I’ve decided to completely change pattern. Well, it worked. In next couple of hrs we’ve hooked 9 pikes and a nice bass  . Landed 7 pikes  and bass ( on the first fish I’ve realised that the landing net is still in the garage)  .  Some of the pikes          This is the first ever bass for my son ( not a “shaker” at all)    Usually on the successful outing I was “inviting” couple of pikes for fish fry contest, and did the same on Sunday, but on the way home I’ve realised that fish fry every weekend become a “boring” event  , so this time I’ve decided to try something new   Here it is before and after    "
