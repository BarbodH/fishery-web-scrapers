121563,solopaddler,2007-10-08 15:10:00,8605,"Headed up to the cabin last Thursday with my dad in tow to close it up for the season and do a bit of fishing. It was just amazing to me how many parties were headed north for the moose hunt starting on Saturday. Seemed like every vehicle on the hwy. was filled with hunters... Anyhow, Thursday was a perfect day: sunny, warm, light s/w wind and the boat ride over to the cabin was beautiful. We figured we had the full day on Friday to fish and Saturday to get all the chores done so after arriving we just relaxed and chilled out on the deck. Friday morning bright and early we took the squareback into a nearby back lake hoping for some walleyes, it was another picture perfect day...   Well perhaps a better man than me could figure out where the walleyes were. On the other hand we had absolutely no problem catching hammer handle pike at will  .   It was seriously crazy fun, in fact I lost count of the number of doubles. Amidst all the frenzy of catching and releasing snotrockets, I had a ""wee"" bit of an accident. First time this has ever happened to me actually....I guess the law of averages finally caught up....  The hook was burried right to the bend in the top of my finger. I tried to wiggle it out past the barb, but it was impossible. Finally I was getting tired of the whole ordeal so just ripped it out with my pliers. If there were any moose in the immediate area I'm fairly sure my blood curdling shriek sent them packing  . Shortly after that episode, getting hungry and tiring of the search for the ellusive walleye, we roped a couple of small pike and headed over to an island to fillet them up and have a shore lunch.    Here's the final product. Believe me when I tell you pike is just as tasty as walleye if filleted properly...  My dad contemplating the mysteries of life.  After lunch we were back at it    Honestly I wouldn't even want to hazzard a guess how many of those things we caught, but it was basically non stop action the entire day we were in there. It's definitely a great lake for kids as there's lots of action. That'll be on the agenda sometime next year with my little ones for sure. It was a faubulous day spent with my dad though, something we definitely don't do enough of. For those that are interested I was quite surprised to see a veritable armada of ministry personel including 2 C.O.'s set up on the gravel road out of the bush. They had a roadside checkpoint set up, checking hunters as they accessed the area north of there for the moose hunt. The fellow I spoke with was a very decent guy, in fact we chatted about some of the back lakes that I havn't fished yet and apparantly a couple are very good. Something to look forward to next year for sure! That's about it, Saturday was close up day, no fishing. Good thing too 'cause the weather went from sunny, calm and a high of 22 on Friday, to a high of 6 with wind and driving rain on Saturday. Not a pleasant day, and pretty much the mother of all cold fronts  . That's it for the cottage trips this year, next trip up will be in May. Damn I hate closing!   cheers,  Mike"

121569,mattyk,2007-10-08 15:18:00,2110,nice report thanks for sharing it with us.
121570,irishfield,2007-10-08 15:18:00,26272,"Another stellar report Mike and another outing shared with your Dad..can't beat that!  I too hate the dreaded cottage closing...I'm off to do that tomorrow or Wednesday, solo it appears. Maybe I needed to steal your handle!"
121573,solopaddler,2007-10-08 15:26:00,8605," Good luck closing on your own Wayne. Honestly if I had the time I'd be happy to offer my assistance.. As far as the name thing goes why don't we switch: You can be ""solofield"", and I'll be ""irishpaddler"""
121579,irishfield,2007-10-08 16:13:00,26272,"LOL Mike ! I've got closing down pat. I replumbed the whole place so everything is down hill to a low spot drain - hot and cold - so while that's doin it's thing I go around and pick up all Leah's solar lights, drawbridge and tie off our floater docks and then put the air compressor on the outside tap and blow out the pipes for good measure. Just hate that ""it's all over"" feeling as I pull away in the boat!"
121580,TJQ,2007-10-08 16:18:00,7806,Nice!!!  Makin' me hungry.... gotta go!
121585,dustink,2007-10-08 16:41:00,526,"Great report, and a great lookin place you got there....  dk"
121592,trapshooter,2007-10-08 16:49:00,1234,"Great report.  Welcome to the 'hook in finger' club.  I made my first one a double - good times.  Couldn't agree with you more - done right, fried pike is just as good as fried walleye.  Most people couldn't tell the difference and if they say they can then they've never had pike done up right."
121594,ccmtcanada,2007-10-08 16:53:00,7971,"""blood curdling shriek sent them packing""  You sure it wasn't shrieking like a school girl?? Oh wait...TJ has that department.  Great report and pics Mike...they are always a pleasure to read and view.  The cottage is now closed up for the season, the fall and winter is upon us, but spring will be here soon enough, with the promise of more great memories for next year."
121602,Moosebunk,2007-10-08 17:20:00,3970,"Sooooo Mike, that's it eh??? That's all?  Primetime piking is ahead and you're bailing.  It was a good summer for ya up at the cabin.  Enjoyed all the reports.  Pike.... Mmmmmm.  For awhile I've been walleye'd out.  Pike has become the new fish of choice for me.  Favorite way is to cook a medium to bigger pike (30-35"") BBQ'd smoked on the cedar plank and just before it's done pour some melted garlic butter to it.  Looking ahead to good stuff in 08."
121614,Whopper,2007-10-08 17:38:00,2174,"Good report Mike except for the hook in the finger. Good to see you get out with your dad and your are correct about the pike, although it is better when they come out of the colder waters from up north. I know your not done fishing for the season which will take the sting out of not being at your cabin, like dk says nice looking place you have there!  Thanks for sharing!  Whopper"
