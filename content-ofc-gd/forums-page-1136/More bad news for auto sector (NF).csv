122213,John,2007-10-10 17:15:00,2956,Chrysler will probably welcome a strike. It would cut many millions from their payroll.
122214,LeXXington,2007-10-10 17:17:00,1928,Wish I had 100% job security
122217,TennesseeGuy,2007-10-10 17:37:00,957,If I worked for Chrysler I'd wake up every day hoping to have a job to go to before they fold.
122244,tonyb,2007-10-10 18:37:00,1637,"Maybe they should start building quality vehicles?...Toyota, Nissan, Honda are all thirsty for our business and it shows in their quality."
122248,Zib,2007-10-10 18:44:00,369," Actually Toyota & Honda's quality has been going down in recent years. They've been having a lot more recalls and more trips to the repair shop. A lot of the parts that go into Toyotas, Hondas, Fords Chrysler etc. are made by the same company."

122412,Jer,2007-10-11 11:13:00,1426,Glad to hear that!  My girlfriend works at a parts plant in Port Hope making dashboards for the plant in Brampton. Good to hear she won't be laid off anytime soon.
