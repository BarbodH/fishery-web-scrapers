121801,bucktail,2007-10-09 12:24:00,1857,Hey Ron  I only catch big fish near green bouys not red bouys!!! I photo shopped the bouy red in the pike photo;-) I am afraid people are going to start photoshopping the pictures to get the bouy numbers off of them! ;-)  D

121861,Roy,2007-10-09 16:34:00,13728,That might be the largest smallie I've seen this year. Congrats to you!
121243,bucktail,2007-10-06 19:32:00,1857,Headed out to simcoe today to see if we could hook into some of the monster smallies that have been showing themselves on the board lately. Lots of BIG storms all around us. Nothing on tubes so we decide3d to troll some breaklines in 25-30 feet of water with crawfish pasttern DT Rapalas. Caught one small fish then moved to a new break line and hooked this baby. It stayed deep the whole time and i thought I had northen until it did a cartwheel 4 feet clear of the water! Bounced the scales between 5.5 nd 5.9lbs. This is the largest smallie I have ever put on a scale and just may be my PB.     Then got chased by some BIG storms!!!!   Darren
