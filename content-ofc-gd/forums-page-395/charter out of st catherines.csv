707575,Freshtrax,2012-06-20 13:35:00,2215,Thanks for the tip. I'm already booked with someone.   I'm just not shure if this time  of year we will be fishing or catching?
707587,dave524,2012-06-20 13:53:00,4508,"Chinooks can be hit or miss that time of year, but offshore Cohoes and Rainbows are pretty consistent out past 240 feet of water."
707615,Live2fish85,2012-06-20 15:08:00,1633,It will be good.
707624,Sinker,2012-06-20 15:40:00,8692," I've been out with Werner a few times as well. Always pounded fish! Him and Big Jim are worth the price of admission, simply for their antics alone  quite the characters!  You will have a great day, no worries. As long as conditions are decent, and you have a decent captain, they should have no problem finding fish. You may find yourself fishing closer to Toronto, than you are St.Catherines, so be prepared for a long boat ride. I would think you would start in close and work your way out. If you don 't mind catching lakers, I'm sure your captain could put you on them non stop all morning.  There are lots of fish out there, and they're relatively easy to catch if you have a decent day!  S."
707865,Freshtrax,2012-06-21 03:18:00,2215,"Thanks guys, I'm pretty stoked I've only chartered twice before. One out of Powell river bc, no fish.
