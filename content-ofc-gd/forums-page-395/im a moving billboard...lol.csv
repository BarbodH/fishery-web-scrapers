707448,mike rousseau,2012-06-20 00:52:00,4661,  carp fishing is actually one of the biggest tourist attractions in our area and way more popular then walleye and musky with tourists... thats why i was asked for a pic with a carp and not a musky or walleye...
707468,adempsey,2012-06-20 01:56:00,1498," Sure thing CARP Mike, lol =)  J/K.  That's pretty cool.  Good picture too."
