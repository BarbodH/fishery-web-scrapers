673895,ah_long,2012-03-07 17:31:00,354,"as title, anyone knows which store carries the new Rapala Concept Ti?  I know Lebaron carries Rapala rods but they chose not to carry the new Concept Ti..  The thing looks like a winner on paper, but I want to try it first hand to see.."
673914,Roy,2012-03-07 18:35:00,13728,"I think most Rapala rod retailers will have them. For the time being, I imagine they're stockpiling in China."
673921,kickingfrog,2012-03-07 19:02:00,8333,"Last year I was interested in putting my hands on their shift series reels, not the rods, to see how they felt compared to my standard reels. None to be found at a retailer. I likly would have bought the same reels anyway but I wanted to see what they had to offer."
673954,Snidley,2012-03-07 20:25:00,620,"A website in the US actually writes articles about Canadian only market Rapala rods and reels, products that I NEVER see, and I'm a tackle junkie. They must have the worlds worst salesmen distributing their stuff."
674013,Gregoire,2012-03-07 22:53:00,1397,I've read that same opinion expressed on another forum. It seems like rapala is creating a bunch of new products but they are awfully hard to find.
674039,ah_long,2012-03-08 00:24:00,354,Lebaron has the Shift and the R type series.. they used to carry the Classic trout but doesn't anymore  I just want to hold the Concept ti and see if it's really that good
674040,Harrison,2012-03-08 00:26:00,2202,I will have some.  Could possibly be at the TO show too.
674043,ah_long,2012-03-08 00:34:00,354,"perfect, I'll be at the show  have you played with them first hand? how do they feel? and what would the pricing be on these guys?"
674122,uglyfish,2012-03-08 03:47:00,981,grimsby tackle usually holds a good amount of rapala rods and reels. be worth the effort to give a call to them and see what they might have.
674244,Harrison,2012-03-08 16:43:00,2202," No I haven't had the chance to hold one yet unfortunately, but those I know who have are really ""excited"" about them.  still working out the pricing, will PM you once it is all arranged.  I have comfirmed they will be at the TO show.  Good Fishing!"
674259,ah_long,2012-03-08 18:00:00,354,"please be cheap, please be cheap... lol  the new BPS carbonlite would be going on it (provided I like it when I see it).. it would be nice to have a combo under 10oz"
707581,s2k4mee,2012-06-20 13:50:00,73,Anyone know where I can find the NT85TR64M1 (Medium/Casting) version of this rod?
707619,lickmyarmpit,2012-06-20 15:19:00,359,"Was at sail on the weekend they had a bunch of rapala reels and rods don't know if they have the one your looking for though, check them on line."
707628,s2k4mee,2012-06-20 15:51:00,73,"The last time I was there, they had the MH only.  Guess I'll check again before bass opener, lol"
