Cant get any easier, just gotta start off with very creamy mashed taters.   Milk, sour cream, cream cheese and butter!  I like to put it in a foil pan that fits the smoker your gonna use.     I use my cheap brinkman.  Works great for this!   Depending how hot your fire, I stir in top smoke crust after 20-30 minutes and let it get smoke encrusted for 20-30 minutes more till done.  Enjoy with your favorite smoked meat.    Thanks for watching."
