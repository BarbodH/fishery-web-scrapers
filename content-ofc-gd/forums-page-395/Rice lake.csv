706090,iFish4real,2012-06-15 13:15:00,386,"hey everybody!!!  Taking the boat out to Rice Lake for the first time tomorrow morning...any suggestion, advice, tips from more experienced ppl with that lake?  Lots of thanks fishermen!!!"
706100,adempsey,2012-06-15 13:42:00,1498,Fish the edges of the weed beds =)  The mouth of the Otonabee and Indian Rivers should be good.     Lots of isolated weed beds all over the lake to pick from as well - just look for those shallow mid-lake humps on your hydro chart.  I find the SW side of the railroad tracks tends to be more productive as well.
706104,iFish4real,2012-06-15 14:03:00,386," Thanks, much appreciated!!!"
706105,iFish4real,2012-06-15 14:11:00,386, do you might happen to know a boat launch coming from 401? tx!!!
706111,Christopheraaron,2012-06-15 14:34:00,3525,"lots of launches on the south side. just drive through the town and take your pick, if your using a canoe or kayak you have many, many options."
706124,Stoty,2012-06-15 15:18:00,2910,Closest to the 401 is Bewdley. Take hwy 28 exit north about 15 mins.  Look for weedlines in 6-12 ft and throw bucktails and crankbaits. Make sure you RIP the bucktails off the bottom.  I'll be out there tomorrow as well. Pop by and say hi if you see me out there!
706126,johnnyb,2012-06-15 15:29:00,3413,"I'll be out there too...first time on Rice for me.  I know I'll recognize Stoty's boat if I see it.....did you settle on a name, btw?"
706127,iFish4real,2012-06-15 15:37:00,386, Sure thing...I don't think I can catch up with you in my 14' Lund 15hp tho Thanks!!!
706129,Sinker,2012-06-15 15:42:00,8692,"Bewdley used to be a great place to launch. They have since changed it, and you have to park in a parking lot that is 2.3km from the launch. I don't go there anymore, even though its the closest launch to my house. I launch off the north shore, on wood duck drive.  Like said, find a weed edge, and jig, cast, or troll it, and you will get some eyes.  S."
706213,Garnet,2012-06-15 23:18:00,2056,Make sure you no were the train tracks are.
706250,iFish4real,2012-06-16 02:01:00,386, I have no idea ...where are they?
706256,Dutch,2012-06-16 02:19:00,831," The rail bed runs across the lake from hiawatha to Tick Island.  It is about 2 k.m. east of the mouth of the Otonabee River (great place to fish btw).  Look for the Steeple on the North side - that's approximately where the tracks are.  Look for the channel markers, there's some on the North, and South sides as well as a big gap im the middle."
706258,adempsey,2012-06-16 02:23:00,1498,You can see it on these maps.  Goes from Harwood on the south to Hiawatha on the north - big red line going across the lake.  http://trakmaps.com/PrintedMapDetails.aspx?PM=c5fe24ab-6337-473a-97be-20fd358b7ca5 http://trakmaps.com/PrintedMapDetails.aspx?PM=f9a2adb1-1205-4ffd-94a1-af7cdcc4f637
706305,Garnet,2012-06-16 12:01:00,2056,"The tracks are all cribs, some the water won't go over your sneakers. Other than the tracks  Rice is very friendly lake."
706665,iFish4real,2012-06-17 21:18:00,386,"So, I guess for the first time there we did pretty well  caught 4 each, one over sized, trolling worm harnesses and casting buck-tails...Too bad we forgot the sun screen in the car, but...a little sun burn teaches the fisherman to always keep some in the boat  "
706760,gino,2012-06-18 04:02:00,400,"t'was a nice my friend, a nice i said..."
706796,johnnyb,2012-06-18 12:45:00,3413,"Well done guys -- I had a great morning out there as well.  Swammers, taildancers, and white grubs all worked for us."
707513,Stoty,2012-06-20 10:10:00,2910," It's unofficially called ""the other woman"" for now! hahaha   Actually, if you use the Capitan's Marina launch it's literally across the road from it."
707527,iFish4real,2012-06-20 11:26:00,386,"  that's where we launched, parking is close...$8/day"
707528,Stoty,2012-06-20 11:30:00,2910, It's a really nice ramp too! That's where I launch from when I launch out of Bewdley.
