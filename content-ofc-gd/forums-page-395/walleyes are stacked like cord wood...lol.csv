707459,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-20 01:23:00,535,Wouldn't it just be easier for you to tell us when they're NOT biting for ya?   Looks like you're well on your way to another great season.
707525,mike rousseau,2012-06-20 11:18:00,4661,  lol...  i only got one outta that group... i didnt have the time to play around for fussy suspended fish... i only had 2 hours to fish before work... i was hitting all my top spots i could... 4 walleye in 2 hours...
707529,kickingfrog,2012-06-20 11:32:00,8333,My experience has been that suspended walleye are active fish and the fussy ones are on the bottom.
707536,mike rousseau,2012-06-20 11:59:00,4661,  not in my experience here...is your experience on a river or lake? cause suspended walleye are fairly rare in my area of the st.lawrence...that i know of... most walleye fisherman i know are fishing on bottom or within 5 feet of it...  if history has taught me anything... those fish were raising up and getting ready to feed on the shallow water at dark...  thats just what ive seen many many times here...  keeping in mind that they were only 100-200 feet from the structure i was fishing... as i came off of the underwater point it dropped off into a major channel and that was what was on the drop off...
