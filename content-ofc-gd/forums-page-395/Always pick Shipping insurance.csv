707366,smally21,2012-06-19 20:40:00,993,"its like 1.20 on each 100 or something. good advice.  what seems funny is imagine any other business that says ""the service is 20$. for another 10$ you can insure against us destroying your property""  how about i just pay you for the service, and if you destroy my stuff you pay for your mistake?  not how it works so i pay the insurance, and as crazy as it sounds, canada post was very good about the claim. no, its true."

707510,Handlebarz,2012-06-20 09:23:00,3790,Dang that sure sucks and how could a package be that trashed? I always insure my packages some people bugger about it but for the extra $$$ its worth it.I have had just 1 package get destroyed and Canada Post paid for the damages it was quite easy I did not have to fight or anything just made my claim

After seeing this, I might do what one of the other posters did and build a aluminum box to place inside the cardboard one !!! lol !!  Really though..... I will be choosing shipping insurance !"
