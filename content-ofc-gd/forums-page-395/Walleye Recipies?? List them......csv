Add the veggies (consisting of sliced carrots, mushrooms, sweet peppers, celery, zuchinnies, etc...) let them zizzle for a minute and then drop the fish filets.... Nothing beats fresh fish cooked over a pit fire in the outdoors... Ummmmmm  The other option is to use a one burner butane Port a Stove...
