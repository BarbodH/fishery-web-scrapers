We've go some big Kings up to 23 Lbs...tons of cohos and bows...everything worked...flies...spoons (black/purple, and black/green did great as it was cloudy all morning. 48-62 feet down in 130-260 fow....marked lot of fish earlier in the morning...less marks later on but still getting hits...lovely day with great company/....lots of fish....no much more one can ask for..... Few shots from the day:            Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
