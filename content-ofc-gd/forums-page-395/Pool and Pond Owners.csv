707744,crappieperchhunter,2012-06-20 21:15:00,2582,Again I say...accidents happen people. Most times the consequences are not this grave. When my son was 2-3 he woke up before the wife and I  and somehow opened the front door...had no idea he could do it. When we woke up he was sitting happily at the picnic table in the back yard. We have no idea now long he was out there before we woke up. What if he wandered on the road...hwy #2 is one block away or into someone's pool or into Harmony creek down at the end of our street?  I'm definitely not pointing the finger of blame at anyone here.  As I said before..those quick to judge the AWFUL  parents perhaps have just been very very fortunate.
707543,Harrison,2012-06-20 12:10:00,2202,"Makes me sick to my stomach as a father of a 6 and 3 yr old.  We try to be as dilligent as we can watching our girls, but it only takes a couple seconds of distraction and they can be in trouble."
707551,Christopheraaron,2012-06-20 12:31:00,3525," Oh, I didn't read the article until now, just saw WAS FENCED in the original post,yes that is a major law that we have to follow with our pool."
707552,quickme,2012-06-20 12:33:00,261,"  i have a 4 and 2 year old.  I have trouble hearing about this kind of stuff without thinking of my own boys.  I notice that when there are other kids around I do keep an eye on them also.  Like you said it only takes a few seconds and something very wrong can happen.  Parents are not perfect, so if you see any kid do something wrong or something that can hurt them speak up and tell them.  Many times parents don't notice.  It's better to have a parent give you an evil eye than to see a little one hurt themselves.   nick"
707553,mbac31,2012-06-20 12:37:00,904,"This thread is a complete joke. Yes someone will lose their kids in a shopping mall or where ever for a few brief seconds but will find them real quick. Thats not losing sight but just something that happens. But this is all on the parents. Im sorry but if your Toddler goes outside, wanders around and is found lifeless in a frogpond that you know is there you freekin idiots. Why the hell is this kid allowed to wander outside like that. No excuse. We are not talking about seconds here folks but alot of minutes for him to drown like that and people being unable to revive. Trust me, I had to do CPR to drown victims twice in my life and its not fun but people can be brought back very quick from water in the lungs. The neighbour did in fact break the law with the fence regulation. I own a Railing and Fence  company so this law Im very familiar with.  But I could care less what the news states, this is solely on the parents or guardian watching the child.  What should be done, you dont have to do anything. The loss of a child will be all that family needs right now. This is not a thread bashing parents for losong their kids for a few seconds. Hell Ive lost my daughter in a grocery store for less than 60 seconds but trust me she got found real quick and got taught a leson of running and hiding like that. I was aso charged in April of this year for pursuading a Local Scarborough idiot from hurting my kids, charges have been dropped but this province is a funny place. I protect my Daughter and I get charged for using excessive force. Screw that, moron wants to touch my kids he is gonna get some broken bones to prove that he failed. I will be honest that if this man didnt stop he was going home in a bag that day. I will watch my kids and protect them as long as Im able to without hovering or being a freak. There comes a time I guess when you have to let go but Jeebus, its not at 2 freekin years old.  Laws are so screwed up here its not even funny anymore. This was the deciding factor why me and my family are moving my Businesses and moving out east. Ontario is becoming a freekin joke for these laws.  Police have no idea who should be charged sometimes.  As you can see these topics get me so frustrated sometimes. Always the other persons fault. Parents dont want to take responseability for anything anymore. Make no dam wonder kids are the way they are now. My daughter is Three and she nows the difference allready. Hearing this yesterday brought a tear to my eye for the parents as well. I could not imagine losing one of my Children to something like this that could have been prevented. I almost disowned  my own sister last year when she had her kids in the bathtub and was not watching them.  People let thigs pass as ""It wont happen to me kida attitude floats in their heads"" Sorry but this should not happen. Trust me, Im sure the charge for the neighbour is in no comparison to the guilt he/she feels this morning knowing that they were a contributing factore to a little innocent child losing their life.    If there are any K's missing in this post, sorry. I have to press very hard as I vaccumed my K off the Laptop. Dont vaccum the dust off your Keyboard , not one of my finer moments."
707560,Live2fish85,2012-06-20 12:59:00,1633,"If your child is 2 and you are losing them then that is a problem. A bit older is understandable. I know when I was a kid like 5 or 6 I used to try and take off to explore, that scared the crap outta my parents. But never at 2.  As for the the pool if he had a fence he was following bylaws but probably left a gatw open. If there wasn't a fence and there is a bylaw for it in that area then he will be getting charged for more then just the fence. He would have had to have a permit to build a pool there in the first place which the city has to allow. There could be alot of things leading to his charges.  Still I blame the parents for not watching a 2 year old close enough."
707562,Headhunter,2012-06-20 13:03:00,5703,"If I heard the news correctly, the property is fenced, but there is no gate at the house to stop anyone from getting in the backyard. That was pointed out by the individual who tried to revive the child before the cops and EMS arrived. Yes, it is law that you must have a fence around any pool or pond... I have one on my property to protect morons from getting in my pool and drowning while I'm away or sleeping. I won't attach blame to this tragedy... it seems there's enough of that already... HH"

I am sure the family of this poor girl feels bad enough without being charged. We don't know all the circumstances but if there are multiple kids especially toddlers its easy to get distracted, I think we would all like to think this would not happen on our watch but never say never. Its hard not to judge as my first thought was where were the parents but taking time to reflect on it I just feel sadness for this family whenever a child dies its a tragedy.  As for all you guys that say you give your kids constant supervision I just don't believe it. We all have had instances where it is not possible. And I consider myself a damn good parent."

Rather than relying on a neighbour fencing and keeping their yards safe. I guess in this day and age blame has to be put somewhere, kinda hard to do it to greiving parents."
707591,smally21,2012-06-20 14:03:00,993,"fencing them in instead of fencing them out. very interesting comment. that's how it works with pets..  one thing to consider is how long the child was unattended for in order for this to happen..  you take your eye off your kid for a few seconds, the gate blows open, whatever, and you cant find them. Which way do you check first? did they go inside? out the gate? around the side of the house? so you pick one and go looking, if you pick the wrong direction the kid is 'lost' longer..but you still only looked away shortly.  im just trying to suggest that its likely the child's absence wasn't unnoticed for the entire period..just that the search was in the other direction.."

It`s like wearing a sign? I`m stupid, but it`s your fault?"

Apparently the fence did not fully encase the backyard on all 4 sides. Yes the house does not count as a side in toronto if it has a door that opens to the back. Thats why there are charges being laid. I do not put the blame in this case on the homeowner, however I do feel very bad for all involved. So sad.

I grabbed him, gave him some of my water in my truck. Called the cops and almost 1 hour later an Idiot of a parent comes to the builders trailer looking for him. Are you kidding me, 1 hour almost passed till she decided to look for him. Crazy!!!!  Gentlemen I did this Construction site where this little guy drowned Yesterday. Not just 2 years ago another boy drowned on the stormwater pond right there in the same subdivision, no fence around that pond  also. Go figure, the city does not have to put a fence around its ponds but the homeowner gets charged. The city here pays guys to open your garbage to look for un recycleable stuff to charge you but they cant get their inspectors to notice from their Air conditioned cars, a missing gate.  Ive had a hole in my driveway that the city caused and its still not fixed. My daughter has fallen into it allready   Sad!!!!  Like I stated before. This is something that can easily be avoided. This is not like an accident in a car or something along those lines, that is truely an accident, this is purely sad. You cant fix stupid I guess.  Harrison, this is a sad sad world when I defend my 3 year old daughter against some drug crazed vagrent and I get stepped on. I was told that because of my size I should have had more common sense then to hurt him so bad. Not my fault Im 280 and drink my milk instead of smoing crack and drinking aftershave. Even the police officer told me he would have done the same. I will do it again if need be. Next time I wont be so nice.  Those Live Target frogs catch everything. Lol.

And as far as being perfect parents and never EVER letting your kids out of your site...well I will freely admit we lost our daughter for a split second  in a shopping mall once. Most terrified I have ever been in my life.  Seems other parents are  like my wife and I and not perfect.  Accidents happen and they always will. It's just too bad when the end result is a tragedy like this one. I feel for both the parents and the neighbor who just wanted to have a nice feature in his yard.
707475,BillM,2012-06-20 03:11:00,17367,"Accidents happen, but apparently we've got a bunch of perfect parents in this thread."
707476,HTHM,2012-06-20 03:18:00,4082,"As this thread is getting more attention, here is a post given in the spirit of public service:  Link to original article: http://gcaptain.com/drowning/?10981  The new captain jumped from the cockpit, fully dressed, and sprinted through the water. A former lifeguard, he kept his eyes on his victim as he headed straight for the owners who were swimming between their anchored sportfisher and the beach. “I think he thinks you’re drowning,” the husband said to his wife. They had been splashing each other and she had screamed but now they were just standing, neck-deep on the sand bar. “We’re fine, what is he doing?” she asked, a little annoyed. “We’re fine!” the husband yelled, waving him off, but his captain kept swimming hard. ”Move!” he barked as he sprinted between the stunned owners. Directly behind them, not ten feet away, their nine-year-old daughter was drowning. Safely above the surface in the arms of the captain, she burst into tears, “Daddy!”  How did this captain know, from fifty feet away, what the father couldn’t recognize from just ten? Drowning is not the violent, splashing, call for help that most people expect. The captain was trained to recognize drowning by experts and years of experience. The father, on the other hand, had learned what drowning looks like by watching television. If you spend time on or near the water (hint: that’s all of us) then you should make sure that you and your crew knows what to look for whenever people enter the water. Until she cried a tearful, “Daddy,” she hadn’t made a sound. As a former Coast Guard rescue swimmer, I wasn’t surprised at all by this story. Drowning is almost always a deceptively quiet event. The waving, splashing, and yelling that dramatic conditioning (television) prepares us to look for, is rarely seen in real life.  The Instinctive Drowning Response – so named by Francesco A. Pia, Ph.D., is what people do to avoid actual or perceived suffocation in the water. And it does not look like most people expect. There is very little splashing, no waving, and no yelling or calls for help of any kind. To get an idea of just how quiet and undramatic from the surface drowning can be, consider this: It is the number two cause of accidental death in children, age 15 and under (just behind vehicle accidents) – of the approximately 750 children who will drown next year, about 375 of them will do so within 25 yards of a parent or other adult. In ten percent of those drownings, the adult will actually watch them do it, having no idea it is happening (source: CDC). Drowning does not look like drowning – Dr. Pia, in an article in the Coast Guard’s On Scene Magazine, described the instinctive drowning response like this:  Except in rare circumstances, drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help. Th e respiratory system was designed for breathing. Speech is the secondary or overlaid function. Breathing must be fulfilled, before speech occurs. Drowning people’s mouths alternately sink below and reappear above the surface of the water. The mouths of drowning people are not above the surface of the water long enough for them to exhale, inhale, and call out for help. When the drowning people’s mouths are above the surface, they exhale and inhale quickly as their mouths start to sink below the surface of the water. Drowning people cannot wave for help. Nature instinctively forces them to extend their arms laterally and press down on the water’s surface. Pressing down on the surface of the water, permits drowning people to leverage their bodies so they can lift their mouths out of the water to breathe. Throughout the Instinctive Drowning Response, drowning people cannot voluntarily control their arm movements. Physiologically, drowning people who are struggling on the surface of the water cannot stop drowning and perform voluntary movements such as waving for help, moving toward a rescuer, or reaching out for a piece of rescue equipment. From beginning to end of the Instinctive Drowning Response people’s bodies remain upright in the water, with no evidence of a supporting kick. Unless rescued by a trained lifeguard, these drowning people can only struggle on the surface of the water from 20 to 60 seconds before submersion occurs. (Source: On Scene Magazine: Fall 2006) This doesn’t mean that a person that is yelling for help and thrashing isn’t in real trouble – they are experience aquatic distress. Not always present before the instinctive drowning response, aquatic distress doesn’t last long – but unlike true drowning, these victims can still assist in there own rescue. They can grab lifelines, throw rings, etc.  Look for these other signs of drowning when persons are n the water:  Head low in the water, mouth at water level Head tilted back with mouth open Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus Eyes closed Hair over forehead or eyes Not using legs – Vertical Hyperventilating or gasping Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway Trying to roll over on the back Ladder climb, rarely out of the water. So if a crew member falls overboard and every looks O.K. – don’t be too sure. Sometimes the most common indication that someone is drowning is that they don’t look like they’re drowning. They may just look like they are treading water and looking up at the deck. One way to be sure? Ask them: “Are you alright?” If they can answer at all – they probably are. If they return a blank stare – you may have less than 30 seconds to get to them. And parents: children playing in the water make noise. When they get quiet, you get to them and find out why."
707477,Grimace,2012-06-20 03:29:00,2020,"  Do you have a kid Bill?   If you do, then tell me the last time that your kid when it was two years old was out of your sight.  Then tell me the last time that your kid was out of your sight long enough to leave your property, enter another persons property, and then fall into a pool and drown. That is a significant amount of time.  Sorry but that is a far from being perfect.  Like I said, My 3 year old has never left my sight while under my care. Never!  Toddlers need constant supervision and by constant I mean that they need to be continuously watched and supervised every second.   It is not like a 5 year old kid where you have established some trust.  It is easy for people with out kids who have never had that responsibility to chuckle at parents like myself that always watch their kids.  It is also very easy for people with older kids who looking back through the years forget just how challenging toddlers can be while looking at their teenagers.  No, I am far from perfect, but my toddler will never leave my sight long enough to run onto a road, into a pond, or into a river or anything like that.  You can go on about 'Why can't we just let kids be kids' and I agree, but toddlers aren't kids yet, they are toddlers and need more supervision, constant supervision."
707479,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-20 03:36:00,535,"   Really. I know of a few times as a toddler I wandered off (I'm the youngest of 5 kids, it was impossible to keep an eye on everyone at once). Thankfully nothing bad happened, which is the case 99.9% of the time. As scary of a thought as it is, you can't protect your kids from everything, and even something like drowning can happen in a very short amount of time. Can somebody HONESTLY say they've never had their kids out of their sight for 30 seconds? If not, then your kids are going to need a good shrink when they're grown up lol.   There's a reason they're called accidents."
707480,Grimace,2012-06-20 03:48:00,2020,"  At 2 or 3 yes!  At 5 or 6 no.  The kid won't need a shrink if it is constantly supervised at 2 or 3 years old.  People over parenting kids are laughable.  I prescribe to the George Carlin school of thought.  But toddlers are different, you have to watch them constantly.  You looking back on your childhood vaguely for evidence on what good parental supervision is for a toddler (which of course most people have no real memory of)is evidence enough for me the guess that you do not have kids. Otherwise you would look back on your adult memories of supervising them through the toddler stage."
707483,Sinker,2012-06-20 03:51:00,8692,"I would call this negligence of the parent as well. I will never understand how a 2 year old can be unsupervised long enough to leave the property, get into a pond, and drown. So tragic, and so preventable.  S."
707486,Twocoda,2012-06-20 04:22:00,4130,You know....the problem with bylaws that seem stupid is to place blame/accountability on someone other than the person(s) that have suffered an expense/loss of unimaginable proportions...In this case there are many faults at play on many different fronts including the city that imposed the bylaw in the first place...(someone had to have died in a previous situation so it became a by law)... Granted due diligence can save lives and bylaws can bring awareness by putting a monetary value to them...but it doesnt change the fact that this happened and will happen again at some point in time regardless of the Laws...People are suffering a tragic accident including the homeowner of the pond...how do you live comfortably in a house or have a BBQ with friends in your backyard knowing something terrible happened right there ....I dont beleive the intentions of a pond are to hurt anyones child...but merely for aesthetics and the enjoyment of a couple of fish to watch while you have a cold beverage...As bad as this may sound...where was the toddlers gaurdian at the time of accident (thats who failed responsibility )..Toddlers are Never to be left alone unless they are sleeping in a crib or playpen and even then...they get checked in on....My heart goes out to all involved for such a tragedy...but if any certain area of this county requires a law to fence a pond to save a life...then i think the whole country should comply to the same rules including our governments obligation to install fences along EVERY river lake pond etc that bears a depth of 2 feet  Not meant to be harsh in anyway way...there are people suffering because of this ACCIDENT but i couldnt hold this in anymore....i really did try My heart goes out to all involved
707496,Live2fish85,2012-06-20 05:13:00,1633,I agree with Grimace and Sinker. I have two daughters the oldest is 2 and a half. I don't take my eyes off of her. It is nothing about being to pertective at all when the child is 2-3 they will always be curious and don't really know right from wrong.  Thinking a kid will need a shrink cause you watch them so close at that age is a dumb thing to say.  I see where Bill is coming from as things do happen. Like my daughter falling off the couch when you go get a drink but at 2 no child should be left unsupervised outside or inside.  It is a tragic thing to hear and sad to see a child lose there life too someone being careless.
707499,Stoty,2012-06-20 05:38:00,2910," His yard was... that's all that should be needed. Totally the parents fault.  But yet again... everyone is innocent...it's ""the other guy"" that's always at fault!"
707503,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-20 06:07:00,535,"  That was more in reference to the ""Mine are 9 and 15 , I do the same "" quote, and even then it was said tongue in cheek. I just find it a little too much how so many people automatically blame the parents and act as if they never made a mistake, like you mentioning your kid falling off the couch. NO parent is perfect, no matter what you think. Who knows, maybe the parents are bad and were passed out from smoking crack, or maybe the parent was distracted for a few seconds while in their yard by another one of their children, a kid can wander off out of sight in 5 seconds and the next thing you know the parent doesn't know which direction the kid went, goes the wrong way looking for the kid and a few seconds turns into a minute which is more than enough time for a child to drown in a neighbour's pond. Like the article posted by HTHM mentioned, a child can drown very close by without even hearing it. Freak occurances happen, what if your kid never fell off the couch, but pulled a large picture tube tv onto itself or something else top heavy when you turned to answer the phone? Doesn't automatically make you a careless/terrible parent. I'm not going to automatically condemn the parents without full knowledge of the situation and act as if nothing bad could ever happen to my kids, that's all I'm saying."

And to the parents that never leave their kids out of their sight.... just wait, it will happen to you too, it just hasn't yet, and it will make you frantic when they disappear.

707517,Stoty,2012-06-20 10:31:00,2910,"I said that SHOULD be all that was needed. No doubt there is a by-law for that, as there is for everything else as well.  What's next... fencing off our bathtubs?!?!"
707519,crappieperchhunter,2012-06-20 10:44:00,2582, X2. I was good...  but my wife was unbelievable and it happened to us. Consider it luck not good management if it never happens to you.  The bottom line though is if buddy would have followed the by-law it never would have happened.  This is one of those laws that a lot of people probably ignore...but it is out there for just this reason.
707535,iFish4real,2012-06-20 11:57:00,386,"  It's even unbelievable such a law exists, it looks like it only applies to private ponds/pools...what if the kid drowned in a public river/lake??? would the police charge the gov. for not fencing them???...totally ridiculous, a 2 year old wondering around long enough to be able to drown in the neighbor's pond absolutely parents/guardians fault..."
