707621,Christopheraaron,2012-06-20 15:30:00,3525,"Heading to quite early tomorrow, plan on renting a boat out of hay bay, trolling walleye in the morning and swinging ropes for gar. I suspect the gar should be easy enough with this weather but what will the walleye be doing? I don't have a down rigger so what should I do?"
707630,BillM,2012-06-20 15:56:00,17367,Why would you need a downrigger for walleyes?
707633,Christopheraaron,2012-06-20 16:07:00,3525,I'm not much of a walley fisherman so I just assumed they would go deep in the heat.
707646,whiskywizard,2012-06-20 16:35:00,305,  check your PMs
707658,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-20 17:10:00,535,"The Bay isn't very deep at all (at least where I've been, not sure about Hay Bay), downriggers would be useless. Of course I've yet to catch anything in the Bay other than dink perch and stupid bass so my opinion on this matter blows."
707716,206,2012-06-20 20:32:00,563,Not sure where on Hay your starting but from hay bay head out to the big bay look for the church on the hill and find and troll the weed line there...Worm harness with a bell weight to get you down some.  Good luck  P.S. not sure on the gar but tons of northerns and good sized bass on the shores of hay bay.  Oh and sheep head to boot
707770,Christopheraaron,2012-06-20 21:57:00,3525,"Thanks for all of the advice guys, I'm sorry to say that plans have changed to rice lake but will refer to this for any trips to quinte."
707913,Stoty,2012-06-21 11:43:00,2910,"Anyone looking to get on some Quinte Walleye in the summer... shoot me a PM and I'll share some info with ya! A lot of people think that the Quinte Walleye only come out to play in the fall/winter...but they are missing out on some of the hardest hits, and best fights of the year during the summer!"
