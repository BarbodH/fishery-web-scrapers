707406,MJL,2012-06-19 22:42:00,2427,"Thanks again guys  The next few years, I'll be trying to get underwater pictures of as many species of fish found in Ontario waters.   The housing is made by Ewa Marine - It's a soft-plastic bag type housing with a lens port. Hopefully by Christmas, I'll have enough funds for a more functional polycarbonate one made by Ikelite."
707425,FisherJuli,2012-06-19 23:16:00,125,Those first few pics of the bookies are spectacular- what colours!!! The underwater shots rock! You are for sure on my radar for stunning pics!! Thx for sharing!

706471,MJL,2012-06-17 02:25:00,2427,"This spring hasn’t been as generous with regards to numbers of fish, but I can’t remember any other spring season where I’ve had as much fun.  Trout  Since I started hunting the resident fish a couple years ago, Brookies & brown trout have taken up more and more of my time in spring. I started with worms and spinners a few years ago but this year I had the luxury of borrowing a couple dozen different fly rods to test out from a friend (who is a guide and a serious gear junky). From 6wt down through 00wt, I tried all the lighter fly rods he had. Some I absolutely did not enjoy casting, some were too long, and others were just absolute bliss – I even tried 1 that was made of bamboo and a few that were fibreglass. After trying out the 0wt, 2wt and 4wt models, I ran to the shop and picked up a 7’11” 3wt Sage TXL-F and a small Orvis Battenkill mid-arbor reel to call my own.  The rod has been a dream to cast in the tiny to moderately small streams I’ve been fishing. When you’re out on the streams 12-17hrs per day, you might as well get something that fits your hand like a glove.  Some pics I took from 1 clear freestone stream      Rising for bugs   Dark purple brookie I caught from a tiny spring creek       Brookie I caught in a stream behind a busy gas station - go figure   Brown which put a nice bend in the 3wt   Lakers/Whities  Since I took up ice fishing for lakers a couple years ago, I’ve always wanted to try to catch one in open water. I also never caught a whitefish either so any opportunity to catch one would be awesome.  A few weeks ago, Will (Young_One) took me & Frozen-Fire out onto Simcoe to try for some whities. The trip didn’t start out good. Will lost his boat plug the day before and we spent the morning in a Wal-Mart parking lot waiting for them to open – We killed time by pushing Will around the parking lot in a shopping cart...  On the water we tried a few different areas without much luck. The last spot of the day, Frozen-Fire gets one whitie to chase his BadBoyz up almost 60ft before it hit    With my 36” med-action ice rod, I managed to hook into a decent sized laker but lost it 15 ft below the boat after an awesome battle  Walleye  I got out twice for walleyes with Will, Frozen-Fire and EC1 the last couple of weeks. It would be my first time ripping bucktail jigs through weeds. Walleye have never been all that kind to me – In a nutshell, I just suck at catching them.LOL  I borrowed a couple bucktails off Will and pitched them into the weeds. I was  surprised at how effective the technique was. A lot of the time, they would hit on the drop and all I’d feel is a little tick on the line. I didn’t leave the lake empty handed and managed to eat my first ever walleye . Floured & fried up in hot oil, the walleyes were tasty!  Double header action   Goldfish  For me, the carp fishing has been slower than normal this year. Usual spots which often cough up 20-50 fish per day haven’t been nearly as generous for the most part. I did still manage to snap some nifty underwater shots of some feisty carp.            Ran into Mikeh at one swim – He was doing well (Frozen-Fire lending a hand with the net)   Sweet mirror   Today I took my dad out to one spot for an early father’s day gift. He enjoyed the trip very much – Last year he complained he hooked into too many fish and his arms were sore after 3.5hrs . This year my dad was happy we hooked into the perfect amount of fish      Hope you enjoyed  Mike"
706474,206,2012-06-17 02:40:00,563,Nice Fish and great pics!!
706477,nroadrunner,2012-06-17 03:15:00,113,great report.  Some very nice colouring on those trout.    Ian
706479,ccmtcanada,2012-06-17 03:21:00,7971,Amazing report Mike!  Love the action shot with MikeEh and frozen fire!  Spectacular!  Great variety of fish this spring...I hope your summer is just as fruitful!
706480,Float Buddha,2012-06-17 03:26:00,20,"Those are some great pics, love the underwater carp ones!"
706485,Jet,2012-06-17 05:24:00,364,I'm having deja vu looking at all these pics  Really amazing shots Mike. You're becoming quite the photographer my friend.
706487,Joeytier,2012-06-17 06:29:00,3990,"Good stuff.  I also just upgraded my fly gear this spring to a 7 ft 3 weight.  The longer, bulkier blanks are nice for longer casts on open stretches of creek but they're a pain once you get in the skinny stuff.  I found the brownies pretty good too, finally."

706636,danc,2012-06-17 18:43:00,4677,Just fantastic shots Mike.
706675,MJL,2012-06-17 22:43:00,2427,"Thanks guys. Glad you liked the pics   Once I pick up a couple switch rods (5 & 7wt) and other bits & bobs of tackle, I’m definitely going to be getting that plane ticket to Cranbrook for some underwater cutty & bull trout photo shoots   Thanks  For the underwater shots, I was using a Canon 40D with an 11-16mm lens   You know it Tyler...After seeing all the pics of brookies that you & DanC post up, they have been on my radar the last couple of years. Finding time to make it north just hasn’t been possible yet. Hopefully if the season is still open in September, I may have a couple weeks off to chase some steelhead-sized brookies your way"
