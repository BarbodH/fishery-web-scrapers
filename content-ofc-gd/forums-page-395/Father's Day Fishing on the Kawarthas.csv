707130,Handlebarz,2012-06-19 02:10:00,3790,Juli it is common for teeth to get pulled from the hooks I have three of them and there is always tissue with them. It is very cool to have it for life long memories of that fish.
707144,Rod Caster,2012-06-19 02:45:00,5784,"No prob, maybe some musky earings will be in order I've never knowingly pulled a tooth from a fish, although I'm sure if there were fish dentists, I'd be good for business!"
707148,FisherJuli,2012-06-19 03:02:00,125,"Hahaha- earrings- of course!! I was up in Cochrane last fall and saw one guy (the 'new guy in the hunting group, undergoing initiation') wear a full set (or maybe more) of moose teeth as earrings and a necklace- dunno if I need to see teeth adorning a human for a long time now! :-)"

707408,MJL,2012-06-19 22:51:00,2427,"Awesome report. I really enjoyed it  Congrats on the PB! Everytime I've hooked a musky on the worm harness, the ending has never been the same"
707427,FisherJuli,2012-06-19 23:21:00,125,"MJL- are you using one with a wire lead? 99% of the ones I use are... Or else I bet I would frown, too! PLUS, my lure on Saturday had two hooks, which saved me when one gave way with the tooth!!"
706734,FisherJuli,2012-06-18 01:16:00,125,"It seems like forever since we have launched the boat (last fall!), but we finally did it!  We officially celebrated the 3rd Annual Father's Day Fishing on the Kawarthas with my two favorite men- my dad, and Frankie65 (and the two strongest fishing inspirations in my life) and it was a fabulous day!  We were on the water well after daybreak (the longest day of the year is a double-edged sword!)- gliding on the waves by 7:30am. It was forecasted to be sketchy day for targeting walleyes- sun, little wind, and HOT- but not much stops us from trying! Fish, or no fish, it was already breathtaking!    I honestly love the commotion of getting the boat on the water, setting up the rods, finding our first target spot... and that first WHAM! Yep, four casts in to the morning, I was fortunate to be the one to get the first hit! This was surely no perch.. not even a walleye (and I starting whooping with excitement!)! The first fish of the day got the adrenaline going more than my two coffees had yet done- and within a minute or two, I saw my awesome beast jump out of the water and do a little tail dance! I yelled! (my apologies to any Kawartha folks rudely awakened by the echo!)  She misbehaved and ran around the boat on me... then, even came out the other side and did a flip while my rod was still on the WRONG side!), but I got her after a 5 minute scuffle. (I am stubborn, and this was gonna be MY fish of the day!) For the first time, we used the fish cradle (from FisherPete!!) and she glided in without any more scuffle. She was wonderful- all 33"" of her, with the most beautiful greens and blues I have ever seen on a musky. (some just look like a dinosaur's decendants to me!) Sorry- the better shot here is on my dad's camera, yet to be retrieved. She's my personal best musky, and I am pretty darned proud of that!    She took a bit of work to send off- but after 3 minutes or so of hanging out with me, she was off for another day!  Video of the release below.    On a weird note (and you guys that have seen me set the hook may understand how it could have possibly happened!), I inadvertantly did a little dental work on my girl (I found it later on the hook that had already fallen out of her mouth): she left me with a very sharp 1/2""+ long tooth on the end of my worm harness! I thought it was a zebra mussel.. but nope! Sorry, girl!    What a fan-tabulous way to start the day with my heart racing like a runaway train!  And so, the day then 'ramped up' with some itsy bitsy babies... and some more... and my dad took the prize for most from the nursery.    But you know, jumbo or mini- I never get tired of these gorgeous little guys!    While the morning was warming up, still and calm, and we were just getting in to a rhythm, my dad nailed this nice 'little' musky of the morning, and after a couple shots from the cradle, off she went!    The boys took some turns at some more little ones... and I think the fish were afraid of my now musky-scented worm harness!    The colours on the fish intrigued me this year- I don't think I have ever seen so many interesting camouflages! (for those of you dispising Rock Bass, please scroll past this one!)    And the day continued to heat up, but we were still smiling!!      Luckily, by noon, a rigid breeze blew throught to cool us off, and allow a drift down the lake. And still, more beautiful, tiny-ish fish!    Over the course of the next couple hours, the fish were well fed, Frank became the King of the Crappies, and my dad took my long-standing title of the most species in the lake- he got nearly everything EXCEPT a walleye!  We were there to try to get some walleyes, and they knew it! 7 hours in to our trip, and not a single walleye! And then- WHAM! One nice tug on Frank's line, and we added a walleye to our list of caught and released for the day!    Nice, toothy, and fun to watch him catch!    All in all, it was a fabulous day with the Top 2 fishermen in my life... and always a blast for me! My 'pesonal best' was icing on the cake, and it would have been a great day without it... but it sure does something for my ego to get the biggie of the day, too!  "
706737,Handlebarz,2012-06-18 01:22:00,3790,Awesome report Juli COngrats for getting out on such a great looking day and a new PB
706742,ccmtcanada,2012-06-18 01:53:00,7971,Now that's a GREAT multi species day on the water!  Congrats on the PB...muskies are a lot of fun aren't they??
706744,Pigeontroller,2012-06-18 01:58:00,2793,Great report!
706763,gino,2012-06-18 04:29:00,400,"Nice report Julie, I went on Saturday with my buddy on Rice had a very good day on walleye, 8 in total,trolled for a while and then ripped some bucktail jigs right on the edge of the weed beds."
706769,corvette1,2012-06-18 07:59:00,1765,great report what a day with your two men congrats on your pb
706788,FisherJuli,2012-06-18 12:12:00,125,"Thanks, guys! Funny enough, the only Muskies I have caught have been with a worm harness and clearly not my target species... of course, a 'pretty one' seems to be the trick! Yeah, they are so much fun to catch, and are really amazing and powerful creatures- it was a BLAST!"
706790,Roy,2012-06-18 12:19:00,13728,Great report Juli and some super memories for you of some fun times. Thank you.
706793,johnnyb,2012-06-18 12:39:00,3413,Great report for a great day -- congrats on the nice musky!
706802,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-18 13:06:00,2690,"  LOL!!  Now that all depends on perspective.  Target species was walleye, and, I DID catch the ONLY walleye (sad as that is) but, yes, she did catch the BIGGEST fish  It was a fun day on the water, always a great time with Craig.  Juli mentioned me being the crappie king, funny thing, but for whatever reason I was catching them all over the lake.  Too bad they weren't a tad bigger, would have made for a good meal."
706804,bigbuck,2012-06-18 13:19:00,2449,Good for you on the PB!!!! It's always nice to get out and wet a line with your dad. I'm trying to get my dad up to HH for a day of fishing.
706810,jigsnreels,2012-06-18 13:30:00,133,"Forget about the muskie, that pumpkinseed is a whopper!  Great report and love the pics!"

706927,esoxansteel,2012-06-18 18:53:00,1307,"Great report, that 1st pic of you holding the musky would be a great cover picture for the new regs coming out in 2013  Also im glad to see that you have been taking smiling lessons off Lew, while holding muskies  LOL  "
707076,Rod Caster,2012-06-18 23:53:00,5784,Great report! That musky is a true beauty
707087,FisherJuli,2012-06-19 00:41:00,125,"Liverelease: Who couldn't smile at catching that fish?!  Beans: world's greatest sportfish, amen- the put up a scrap for their size!  Hahaha.. Thx to the rest of you!  But come on-- no comments on the crazy musky tooth?! Is it more common than I imagined?!! That thing is so sharp... Well, it's a flippin' musky tooth!"
707090,Rod Caster,2012-06-19 00:46:00,5784," Send it to my GF, she'll make a cool necklace with it for you!"
707097,FisherJuli,2012-06-19 00:58:00,125,"Thanks for the offer, but I framed it already in a little frame. If I get a full set, I will definitely have to get in touch with her! Have you ever pulled a fish tooth?! It was wild!"
707119,esoxansteel,2012-06-19 01:39:00,1307,"If you get bit, or cut by a raker or the teeth, or those nasty's on the upper jaw, between the upper rows of teeth, your best friend will be polysporin as infection is not far behind, and god help you if you on blood thinners. Been there Done that  "
707125,FisherJuli,2012-06-19 01:46:00,125,Liverelease- i didn't actually pull the musky tooth. My hook must have come under her roots and pulled it out in the fight- totally by mistake. I found it after I put her back in the water while checking my lure. It was just stuck on the end of the hook! But you're 100% bang on the cuts- not fun!
