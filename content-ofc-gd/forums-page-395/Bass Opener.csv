707570,Jigger,2012-06-20 13:25:00,1237,"Ill be throwing the exact same bait to the exact same island point that i have for the last 10yrs. After that, all options are on the table."
707598,Gregoire,2012-06-20 14:20:00,1397,"I will rig one rod with a pink semko Another rod with a shaky head Another with a popper another with a jig for pitching into the muck Another spinning rod with a jerkbait I will also be bringing a light musky set up, but I won't be fishing for the pike in the lake. I am excited about this rod, as I hope to be able to entice a few monsters into biting. I will also be bringing two cheap combos for my buddies to use. I am excited to get home tomorrow to pack all my bass stuff. I will only be able to get out Saturday afternoon evening and maybe Sunday morning if my hangover and time allows."
707604,BillM,2012-06-20 14:32:00,17367,I think I'll be fishing salmon.
707606,highdrifter,2012-06-20 14:35:00,2534,Kawartha Highlands.  Nough said.
707608,highdrifter,2012-06-20 14:36:00,2534, You name that ski yet pal?
707610,Live2fish85,2012-06-20 14:51:00,1633,I will be fishing Erie as I always do for opener.  I will be drop shottin with the best baits that there is for Erie.
707622,torco,2012-06-20 15:34:00,656,"I have a wedding this weekend, tis the season. But my wife told me last night we don't need to leave until around 4pm. So I'll take what I can get and see if I can get any local bass to take a fly around town."
707642,Jigger,2012-06-20 16:25:00,1237," Yeah, Castro. Im gonna jam a hook in his face.."
707691,Spiel,2012-06-20 19:26:00,9065, Good choice!
707008,misfish,2012-06-18 21:10:00,29133,"Will be flipp,n and pitch,n and ripp,n lips with a good buddy."
707025,206,2012-06-18 21:39:00,563,We'll be camped out on the scugog river just south of lindsay....Miles of pads and slop  Can't wait.
707165,Stoty,2012-06-19 05:02:00,2910,"I was planning on fishing the Quinte BassChamps event until I heard that it's a trickle start, which is a HUGE disadvantage for the higher numbers teams. They will miss out on most, if not all of the first hour. Maybe they will change it next year to match the ""BassChamps"" events in the US, where everyone gets out to their spots, and waits for the ""go"" to start the tournament. That way, all teams get exactly the same fishing time. Which is quite important in an ""hourly"" event.  Instead... I'll be on pre-fishing Rice from Sat-Tuesday!"
707166,Toad Hunter,2012-06-19 05:28:00,261,"Kashagawigamog of course ! I'll be fishing for just about anything at this point as it will be the first weekend I will get the boat up there, after my ""reno"" project and finally having the new trailer and deck all set up to my standards. -and now will not have to worry about pesky OOS fish"
707167,Toad Hunter,2012-06-19 05:35:00,261,"and now I can hit my honey hole on the Grand through the weeks that I am on the ""noons"" shift too"
707168,Garfisher,2012-06-19 05:39:00,229,"Somewhere on the Scugog River in Lindsay after work, it'll be nice using gulp leeches for multi-species later next week"
707169,Toad Hunter,2012-06-19 05:45:00,261,"This time of year makes me giddy- like -gr. 7 about to be off for the ""whoooole summer"" kinda giddy"
707176,GYPSY400,2012-06-19 09:11:00,191,Lake X in the Sudbury region.. 3 day trip.
707322,grimsbylander,2012-06-19 18:40:00,3016,Upper Niagara and Erie. I've been fishing the US side for weeks and can't wait to hit my Canadian side spots!
707327,Ainsley,2012-06-19 18:51:00,142,"What techniques is everyone going to be trying? I had great luck with sinners and cranks last year, especially the bomber fat free shad. Going to try more tubes and other plastics this year."
707331,JoshS,2012-06-19 19:06:00,729,"I'll be fishing the same north kawartha lake I've been doing the past 4 openers. Although bass has taken the back seat for me the last 2 years, I'm loosing sleep this week in anticipation of that sun rising Saturday.  My first cast will be a wacky rigged senko to a rock ledge that I know will cough up a few smallies. Then top water and spinnerbait over some weed flats then on to the pitching. Can't wait!!"
707333,d_paluch,2012-06-19 19:06:00,343,"G-bay for the weekend hopefully nailing the smallies. Will probably be using live worms more than anything, why mess with a tried and true method?"
707334,jigsnreels,2012-06-19 19:07:00,133,Spinnerbaits and curly-tail grubs.  They do the job for what we have around these here parts...
707335,Moosebunk,2012-06-19 19:13:00,3970,"Going to a party with the fam!!!  Can't wait to miss opener then enjoy it later, during some midweek day alone with the fishes!"
707355,Garry2Rs,2012-06-19 19:57:00,1425,"It may be too late for top-water in my favourite weedy bay, but I will be in the Northeast Kawartha's with a plastic toad. If the doesn't work out I will move on to more open shallow water. If that doesn't work, it will be Senko time around rocks and docks...grin. Last week on a musky hunt I had plenty of bass action on a Jerk-bait and a large spinner-bait, but I'm looking forward to using plastics, until I'm forced to change my mind."
707365,Pigeontroller,2012-06-19 20:37:00,2793,"Bass on Erie should be shallow still, casting crankbaits and topwaters for sure!"
707368,JoshS,2012-06-19 20:44:00,729," Gary, think we might be on the same lake if I recall your home waters. I'll be starting out of the west. Good fishin!"
707369,misfish,2012-06-19 20:45:00,29133," Garry,there,s nothing like that tick,line screaming back to the boat when flipp,n. Missed it last year,do to complications   ,but totally stoked about this weekend.  Smallies on the menu the next coming weekends.  Long weekend ,will be my chance to wade and fly fish for bass and pike up at my pops."
707380,Toad Hunter,2012-06-19 21:11:00,261,"I'm itchin to try the live target field mice I've picked up, had some nice blow ups with the hollow body frogs last year but foolishly set the hook to fast"
707409,Garry2Rs,2012-06-19 22:51:00,1425,"My toads are fished very fast, like a buzz-bait... I like the hollow body stuff too, but fish them slower, with more finesse.  Back a few years I loved Flukes, but they were a little fragile. The solid body frog/toads are more durable and can be fished faster.  Some blow-ups are small fish just grabbing a foot, or the skirt etc.  I try to stop reeling when this happens. There is often a larger fish trailing... If the bait goes dead in the water, or even sinks a bit, the big fish will often move up and grab the cripple."
707424,Garfisher,2012-06-19 23:12:00,229,"I will probably be fishing Baby Brush Hogs, hopefully the toad bite heats up further into the evening though. Before 8am on Georgian Bay last year was a great toad bite (Chigger Toads in case anyone wondered) in a little bay I fished, reeled in just fast enough to get the legs going at a decent kick, never got one under a pound."
707434,Toad Hunter,2012-06-19 23:47:00,261,I've had luck pitchin assorted soft platics of the bug or craw variety right behind my missed hook sets- guess I fool them into thinkin they've wounded my frog- regardless of the different appearence
707436,Toad Hunter,2012-06-19 23:51:00,261,"But I agree with some of the ones that bit the sinking pitchin jigs, they were smaller than I'd like but would have still been nice to land em on the top waters"
707559,lastcall,2012-06-20 12:56:00,33,Kashagawigamog...first i have to replace a 42' deck with new lumber but will find time to fish. my wife is staying home so what she don't know will not hurt.
707561,backbay,2012-06-20 13:01:00,773,"Subject to the time of day, topwater and jerkbaits will be my preferred lures to throw. If that's not happening, I'll get the fluke-type baits out."
706836,Luke V.,2012-06-18 15:08:00,286,"So with Bass opening on the 23rd, where is everyone going to be?  I will be on the Upper Niagara River insearch of the 7-8 lb smallie that has been evading me for the past year or two.   Tight Lines  Luke"
706840,Acountdeleted,2012-06-18 15:19:00,2562,"4 days at Fushimi and Longlac up in Northeastern Ontario for Pike and Walleye.  The bass can wait one more week. I've been planning this trip for 3 years now.  That being said, soon as I get back I've got a date with Mountsberg resevior.... or Heart Lake...... or Toronto islands."
706841,jigsnreels,2012-06-18 15:22:00,133,Somewhere within London city limits.  Most likely under a bridge.

706874,DanD,2012-06-18 16:31:00,2223,"We’ll be out in the pack, drifting between Bait Island and EC10 of Long Point Bay. First time in close to 20 years that I haven’t had my own boat; so I’ll be hitching a ride in my eldest brother’s. So if anyone sees a white (trimmed in black) 28 foot Chaparral with the name Just Once “Again” that’ll be us. His radio is usually scanning between channels 68 and 69; so give out a yell and say hello.  Dan."
706875,Luke V.,2012-06-18 16:32:00,286,  Sounds like a great few days. Im sure you will not be disapointed!

706918,johnnyb,2012-06-18 18:27:00,3413,"Depends on a combination of wifey's work schedule and babysitter availability.  Somewhere like 3 Mile in Muskoka or Gull in Minden, with possible back-up plans on Rice or Orangeville Reservoir.  Well...Orangeville is more like an emergency measure than a backup plan....but I'll take what I can get  "
706919,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-18 18:35:00,1107, I will be out there early morning but once it get's busy I'm heading for bluffs looking for some big girls
706920,Ainsley,2012-06-18 18:42:00,142,Hopefully I'll be in the upper Niagara river. Had a big smallie hit my DC10 when I was casting for Muskie last weekend.

706990,Jer,2012-06-18 20:36:00,1426,Most every other year it would be right here on Buckhorn. This year a smaller North Kawartha lake for a change.
706992,frodobuggins,2012-06-18 20:42:00,127, I went to UWO and used to catch smallies between the bridge at oxford and the first one south of that...then i would drink heavily and have  a 10 lb panzo from the alibi
