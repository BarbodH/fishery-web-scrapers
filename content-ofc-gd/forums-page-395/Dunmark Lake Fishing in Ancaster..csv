707188,Canitalian,2012-06-19 10:14:00,75,Drove by it on the 403. Looks interesting. Anyone have any info on this lake? Are there fish? Can it be fished?
707198,smally21,2012-06-19 11:46:00,993,"never heard anything about anyone fishing it. access would be a problem. off of dunmark rd is heron point golf club, and all private properties off of jerseyvile rd/sunnyridge rd.  it is almost as big as the local conservation area lakes and i would only assume the fishing to be similar. its muddy complexion suggests it may be shallow."
707202,Canitalian,2012-06-19 11:53:00,75,"Unless the website of hookandbullet.com hasn't updated their info in years, http://www.hookandbullet.com/fishing-dunmark-lake-aylmer-on/ Says there's Bass and Pike. Please follow up. Thanks."
707233,Steve,2012-06-19 13:54:00,2075,there are those species.  we used to fish it at night as kids....  no public access.
707236,Canitalian,2012-06-19 14:00:00,75,Thanks for the heads up. ?
707237,johnnyb,2012-06-19 14:02:00,3413,"Just a heads up....hook and bullet is completely useless for species lists.  Go back and look up the same lake a few different times.  You'll get different species.  When you see sturgeon and salmon in small landlocked lakes, you get the idea."
707252,Canitalian,2012-06-19 15:27:00,75,True enough.
