707410,krixxer,2012-06-19 22:52:00,274,Got a great offer to spend this weekend at a cottage on the island.  Although I think she is just using me for a ride to the island I'm determined to come back smelling of fish one way or the other!  I understand the landscape but the couch is new to me. Any pointers?
