The weather looks great this weekend in my area just a little heat so the am and pm bite should be great
705940,Handlebarz,2012-06-14 23:05:00,3790,PAB thats always a great feeling getting slime on your own bait. Nice going for sure. Ron on a fly rod very cool Spooled sorry you were fishing for eyes it does not count Well I guess it does  only 8 in for the draw so far
706419,Fisherpete,2012-06-16 22:44:00,1814,"Here's my best from this year so far, a nice 42""    And my pal Patrick's 45.5""    Can't wait to get out again!!!"

706437,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-17 00:16:00,535,My 2nd tiger this year. Small but fast little bugger.    
706458,I'mHooked,2012-06-17 01:07:00,525,"Official report to follow in day or 2 with rest of catch, however here's my personal best out with Cowanjo Thursday & yesterday. My 2nd time Musky fishing with Cowanjo and total 6 fish landed (not including his own). This one a hair below 46"" (I'm 6'1"" 225 lbs   ) (While this one wasn't on a Handlebarz, I did land a 32"" as well which nailed my one and only Handlebarz lure, a Gold/Brass double 10! Only have about 8 Musky lure so far...it's a slippery slope!!)  Woohoo!!!    Yah baby!!!  She hit less than 30 casts into the day before 9am."
706489,SlowPoke,2012-06-17 10:42:00,2984, VERY nice fish!!!!
706504,Handlebarz,2012-06-17 12:19:00,3790,That's great guys congrats on the great start to the season and PB's  Will add you guys to the list
706546,lifeisfun,2012-06-17 14:32:00,99,Yesterday evening my 1st time ( in my boat) fishing buddie Mark scored his PB Ottawa River beauty After quick lamprey cleanup and pictures she was released in to the wild again. In my case only nice size walleye but other than that this year I still suck
706549,SlowPoke,2012-06-17 14:37:00,2984,"Whoa.... Mike, you're gonna have a tough decision!"
706550,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-17 14:45:00,2690,"  Don't think he has to decide, Brian.  His daughter is pulling one of the names out of a hat"
706552,SlowPoke,2012-06-17 14:58:00,2984," Ooops, lost sight of the rules"
706562,Gregoire,2012-06-17 15:18:00,1397,That is a healthy long fish. Did you measure it?
706700,FisherJuli,2012-06-17 23:53:00,125,"We FINALLY got out in the boat yesterday on the Kawarthas (full details in General Discussion), had a great time, AND I caught this baby!! Here's my muskie- it was a scrappy one, and so much fun to catch, measuring 33""!!!  "
706706,fishnsled,2012-06-18 00:01:00,3520,"Had a great day on Saturday with CCMT. No monsters but some quality fish. I'll put up Cliff's pic for him since it was on my camera (and he really need to add to his musky lure selection  , hope that's OK Mike), as well as the 2 that I boated. Report to come.  CCMT's 39incher    My 38 incher    And my 37 incher.  "
706743,ccmtcanada,2012-06-18 01:56:00,7971, Will...I have 7 muskie lures...isn't that enough?  So what if I was throwing a trolling lure in 8 feet of water because it was the only thing I had that could dive...LOL
706747,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-18 02:16:00,535,"  You'll end up having a few favourites that you keep going back to anyway, and most won't see the water much."
706776,Handlebarz,2012-06-18 09:45:00,3790,Great going it's nice to see the musky reports coming in and the PB's one day left then we will pick a winner
706824,fishnsled,2012-06-18 14:28:00,3520, You might be right as I only threw about 7 or 8 different baits of the 100 or more that I brought. LOL!!
707028,lifeisfun,2012-06-18 21:48:00,99,I like to enter Mike's Moira fish that he caught couple weeks ago. It was rainy weekend so he worked for this fish really hard  
707079,Handlebarz,2012-06-19 00:00:00,3790,Nice ski it sure is a great feeling when you work hard for a fish  About 24 hours left and we will draw the winner I want to thank everyone for posting here we still have to wet a musky line and seeing all These ones helps to get through.
707101,me2grant,2012-06-19 01:07:00,2,Not a muskie but my new personal best pike caught on opening day. 44 inch 25 pounds.  
707105,Handlebarz,2012-06-19 01:12:00,3790,Beauty pike it will count
707391,Handlebarz,2012-06-19 22:03:00,3790,I will make the draw around 8pm tonight you still have time to enter.
707394,Roy,2012-06-19 22:11:00,13728,"Thank you. A really great initiative, Mike. Glad it's a draw because picking a winner would be very difficult. They're all great! Looking forward to 8PM."
702197,Handlebarz,2012-06-02 15:37:00,3790,Well my daughter and I missed the opener today so I was sitting here building some baits and got the idea to run a contest for 4 different Handlebarz lures I just built these today just for this contest. Its open to all OFC members who are looking for musky you dont need to catch a musky or the biggest one just get out and have fun then share it here.  Simple rules  post a photo of either your in season musky from this year caught on or after June 2nd or June 16th You don't have to be out on opener day just caught in season 2012.  or post a photo of your day on the water looking for musky I just want to see what everyone was doing for opener.It could be someone casting a kid holing a huge musky lure a rod in a rod holder trolling just what ever your opener day was.  The closing date will Be June 19th this gives the musky nuts in the north a chance to enter also.  I will put down all the names of the members who respond here with there days adventure and have my daughter pull a name that lucky musky nut will get all 4 baits my banner will stay here with me.  There will be one of each size bait I make double 10 copper walleye and 8 Armageddon inline flashabou and a large Egg head electric black with musky red/black blade that has a single size 10 magnum blade as well as the new out for this year my small egg head Yellow Jacket which has a size 8 Colorado its built with the same strength as all my baits but perfect for casting with you pike gear.  Good luck I'm looking forward to the reports.  
702199,SlowPoke,2012-06-02 15:41:00,2984,Nice Mike!!! I hope we see some great opener shots
702201,GBW,2012-06-02 15:46:00,8460,very cool! too bad I passed up on the opener today for the Brooklin fair with the Mrs and kids...  so does that count as she's got a mean bite?
702204,backbay,2012-06-02 15:53:00,773,"Three Cheers for Mike!:clapping: Thanks, Hope I can get north in time for the contest! Chris"
702262,MuskieWannabe,2012-06-02 21:55:00,79,"Here's my opener, 42.5""  "
702264,SlowPoke,2012-06-02 21:59:00,2984, Looks like you're the front runner! Nice fish.
702267,mercman,2012-06-02 22:05:00,7054,"Spent yesterday an most of today with Musky Mike. Arrived at his place yesterday and we decided to hit the Fran for some eyes. Up at 6am and it was cold and windy and even though we saw only one musky on our day on the Rideau(Mike got into a nice 45 incher that rolled in the weed bed and shook the hook )  Did manage fish though I got this 8 lb baby, and Mike and i did well on the walleye. "
702552,Handlebarz,2012-06-04 01:11:00,3790,Nice start MW I must say I am shocked that there are not a lot more reports in yet not for here but in general. Hope to see everyone getting started in the next few weeks.
702562,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-04 01:35:00,535,"No musky, but a new PB pike, 30.5""."
702574,SlowPoke,2012-06-04 02:12:00,2984,I'd be happy with that!
702577,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-04 02:24:00,535,"  Thanks, I was just glad to catch something. Also, I must be a complete moron because no matter what I try, I can't get pictures to show up on the page."
702578,Nipfisher,2012-06-04 02:26:00,2449,  Just copy the image code and paste it right into the text of your report.
702582,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-06-04 02:35:00,535, Thanks! I must have been using the wrong link codes before.
702598,Gregoire,2012-06-04 03:17:00,1397,I went out and discovered a new way to catch trophy walleye. My secret lure is a topraider.
702604,Slop,2012-06-04 03:30:00,151,"Thanks for the gesture Mike, the pressure will be felt with every cast.  It's 'crunch time'"
702625,Joeytier,2012-06-04 10:59:00,3990,"Still waiting to receive pictures of my 50"" er from a friend caught this opener."
702856,Handlebarz,2012-06-04 21:55:00,3790, Habs fans can't enter  Congrats on a 50 for opener lots of time to enter.  Brian you can not enter another persons pike for your entry at least photoshop it lol Topraider walleye count just nice to here everyone getting out

704102,Djeep,2012-06-09 03:48:00,199,I got two muskies on opening weekend and unfortunately this was the bigger of the pair. It was my first muskie on the fly rod with a mess of a fly i tied from bucktail in the bench vise.  need those baits to get a real muskie out on LSC though!  
704437,Handlebarz,2012-06-10 19:57:00,3790,Nice to see others getting out. Don't forget there is still time to post here I will be waiting for the northern opener before drawing a name
