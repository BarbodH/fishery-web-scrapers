On Saturday I decided that I should spend one last hurrah in Ontario with my favourite things. Fishing and with my girlfriend (who hasn't been since she was 9)  I have a honey hole not too far out of the city so we decided to go there.  Action was slow to begin with and then something strange happened.  The rainbow trout happened.     I have never seen rainbow trout out of this lake before. Rumors were that their used to be some but I had never heard of anyone catching any. Within half an hour we had half a dozen, all good eating size, but it being my last few days in Ontario, good karma told me to throw em back.  A little more fishing, pumpkinseeds mostly, then I hook into a bass.    Yeah I know, not exactly a record breaker. Was good to see one.  My girlfriend hooked into a good sized catfish, which was great. Gave her a good fight and I was able to give her a few tips on fighting the fish and letting it run. She picked up the techniques quick.    Its a good thing she did because not long after, her rod bent almost totally in half. Using the techniques I just taught her, she fought the fish like an expert and stole the show with what I can only describe as a monster.      Its been years since I saw a bass that big, and I have never even seen one half that size out of this lake. Truly an amazing going away present.  Until we meet again Ontario. So long and thanks for all the fish.  "

Lots of big rainbows in the Bow river, well when it is not overflowing it's banks  Also, alot less bugs in Alberta too.  Don't even think earwigs are a known bug out there"
