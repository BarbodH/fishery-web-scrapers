796860,Twocoda,2013-07-07 04:00:00,4130,The tides are changing.....i was fishing off Kettle Point in open water years ago and was asked by the native cops to produce a licence of which i knew nothing of...they did t charge me but did inform me that i would need one to fish where i was  fishing...they have a 5 or 6 mile radius of the point....ii never persued the validity of the claim...i just didnt fish that area anymore...things are changing rapidly though..natives are requiring permits from their bands and even pay to go on Sauble  beach...just like we do if they want to swim ...interesting times .....years ago we were asked to leave the salmon river mouth in Shannonville because we did t have status
796883,pike slayer,2013-07-07 13:34:00,1177,"i've fished the garden river from shore a few years back and a couple natives came up to me and my group of friends and told us we'd need to buy a license to fish their land. i told them i already had an ontario license. they started to get rude with me and i got rude back and they threaten to slash the tires on my truck and beat us up. before things got anymore heated we decided to leave. i went back a few more times and nobody ever bothered me again. i think its just a few natives with alot of pride trying to do this.i was also told from a few different people that i would need one of their licenses to fish the their couple lakes on the garden river reserve and that they put some kind of gate up on the jardin mine road so you cant access reserve lake, jarvis, crooked,etc. i don't know if their is any truth to it or if i'd actually have to get a license and to be honest i really dont care. i can access those lakes from island lakes or northland anyway.also i was told they have a gate on frater road in lake superior park?!?i've never explored these areas because i dont want to be confronted back in the middle of nowhere. theres lots of other places to fish.does any sault locals have any truth to this or is it just a bunch of stories to keep people away from the areas?"
796937,RJackson,2013-07-07 19:18:00,113,I'm shocked knowing the area you fish that you've never heard or run across this Mike.  They usually have them for sale on the spot.  They also can be bought at most of your local marinas.  $10 can save the hassle in the future.  RJ
796950,Bill Shearer,2013-07-07 21:14:00,456,"I have been fishing a US reservation  for many years now. A reservation license is required by all non-status Indians there. I am thankful that I can fish there at all, since it wasn't many years before I started that it was illegal for any non-status Indian to fish those waters.You be the judge. If you feel the waters offer good opportunities for exceptional fishing, then buy the license. If not stay out. Their property, their rules.After all, although it definitely wasn't me or you, we signed a treaty that gave them that land. The least we can do is pay them their due."
795858,mike rousseau,2013-07-01 06:29:00,4661,"So I got stopped by ""Mohawk conservation officers"" the other day and was basically told I need to buy a Mohawk license on the spot or get a ticket for fishing their ""territory"" without a permit... They claim their territory is from Montreal to Kingston.... I asked for paperwork stating that its law to have their permit... They didn't have anything nor could they tell me where I could get it.... Nor did they show proper ID... All I got was a business card....  Anyways... Has anyone ever heard of this anywhere in Canada... Needing a special native territory license on top of a provincial license...?  The ""officer"" even went so far as to say If I have a reservation permit... I do NOT require any other license... And if Ontario/Quebec/NY officers give me a ticket or anything else that the mohawk conservation legal department will take the ticket to court....   It all sound like Bull to me...  I'm going to be calling the Ontario MNR this week and get it sorted out... But I'm curious if anyone else has run into this anywhere else...  Thanks Mike"
795861,porkpie,2013-07-01 10:14:00,2521,They where trying to make a quick buck off you!  Glad you didn't get taken!
795864,bigbuck,2013-07-01 10:27:00,2449,Scammers trying to make a buck. I'd report it to the OPP as well as the MNR.
795865,Fish Farmer,2013-07-01 10:30:00,2234,"You gotta be kidding, our brother Roy should know if anyone should. How about it Roy, don't you fish that territory? Never heard of such a thing. I fish the Grand and they say they own it and have never been bothered."
795868,bigugli,2013-07-01 10:49:00,6138,Buildup to another Mohawk  PRfest and court challenge.
795876,HTHM,2013-07-01 12:26:00,4082,"As it would be a federal matter, not provincial, talk to the RCMP in Cornwall. Could make for an interesting conversation. The reason I say it is a federal matter, this would be one nation disputing territory rights with another nation."
795879,BLOO KANOO,2013-07-01 12:41:00,20,"I'd say you handled that about as well as you could.Sometimes those situations can turn ugly. I agree with the others that you should report that to the police. They were trying to intimidate you into buying a license to make a quick buck. The problem is, the police probably won't do anything about because they are afraid to confront natives on just about everything. Thats why these guys try this stuff.......Because they can get away with it."
795880,Fisherman,2013-07-01 12:46:00,7201,"One of these days...it's gonna get ugly, like real ugly."
795885,lew,2013-07-01 13:00:00,12766,"Gonna be your word against theirs Mike and if you were alone in your boat  with nobody else to back up your story, there probably isn't a thing the authorities can, or will do about it.  Did you think to get their boat registration numbers ??.....just a chance that they've pulled this scam before and maybe others have reported it  with the numbers and the police may have it on record."
795886,4x4bassin,2013-07-01 13:08:00,1025,Sounds a little sketchy to me !
795895,solopaddler,2013-07-01 13:49:00,8605,"  Yes, the Garden River first nations require you to purchase a reserve license when fishing the lower end of the Mississagi river.(maybe for elsewhere in their territory as well not sure). There's a very popular waterfall right at hwy 17 that tons of people fish for pink salmon and you need a reserve license to fish it."
795896,darsky,2013-07-01 13:53:00,586,and if the MCO gave you the ticket and you did not pay it.......what then???
795897,grimsbylander,2013-07-01 13:53:00,3016,"Let me play it out for you... Mike: ""We'll Mr. OPP officer, I was told I need to buy another license or be charged."" Officer: ""That's crazy...and illegal. I'd can't wait to find them and charge them. There is nothing worse than people who fraudulently scam honest people!"" Mike: ""Great! And btw,they were natives."" Officer: ""Wow, look at the time!! I'm off duty soon! Hey sorry about your luck! Cya!!"""
795900,Rich,2013-07-01 14:25:00,3927,Lol
795902,mike rousseau,2013-07-01 14:33:00,4661,Is that fishing open water or from shore.... It's different apparently...  From the very little information I found online... It may be a legit license and requirement IF... You are fishing from one of their islands/shore OR... Fishing IN one of the associated weed beds....  If your fishing open water or outside these said weedbeds it isn't a requirement....  This was from a local newspaper article relaying information received from a local government officials office...   Like suggested ill be talking to the RCMP and Ontario MNR and getting something in writing....
795904,F7Firecat,2013-07-01 14:44:00,347,winner winner chicken dinner!!! you got that 100% correct grimsbylander!
795905,mike rousseau,2013-07-01 14:49:00,4661,And just so we are all clear... I have no issues buying a territory license.... But if I never leave said territory I shouldn't require any other license.... IMO....
795907,solopaddler,2013-07-01 15:01:00,8605, Good point. Definitely from shore only.
795992,ctdd2006,2013-07-02 03:53:00,531,Mississagi First Nation near Blind River also on the Mississagi River requires one.  I've been told fishing from shore or if you launch from their launch.  If you come up river in your boat you are okay.
795996,solopaddler,2013-07-02 08:38:00,8605,    Thanks for the correction.
796004,pikehunter,2013-07-02 11:29:00,1659,"This is rediculous! First I've heard of this. If this is true then why does the Ont. regs. not state it? This plus the fact that the zone maps don't blank out reservation lands. Please report this incident and keep the rest of us informed.  Note...I just deleted all the rest of what I typed here about my feelings and thoughts in regards to the on going and never ending issues with this group of ""Canadians"" to keep this post from being locked down or erased!      "
796054,TDunn,2013-07-02 16:31:00,680,I launch in garden river all the time. No fee other than launch.
796062,spinnerbaitking,2013-07-02 17:04:00,1622,I've been told you need one if you fish their weed bed in Lake St Clair but never headed in side the posts put up Tight Lines SBK
796142,Jigs,2013-07-02 23:22:00,136,"I was trolling in the St-Regis once about 7-8 years ago and some guys showed up and asked about a Mohawk license. I had a Quebec, NY state and Ontario one as I always do. A friend of mine told me that he always gets his Mohawk license at Fence Depot now just in case. Might pick one up. I think they're 10 bucks for the year. 10 bucks is worth spending just so you can flash it and get them off your back if it does happen. One thing I've learned as I'm sure you have about fishing here...no one is quite sure who has jurisdiction over what in these waters."
796758,Out4Trout,2013-07-06 06:15:00,98,"When asked, just show them the ""license"". We have two of these licenses, one on each hand, beside the index finger."
