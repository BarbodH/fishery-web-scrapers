A new boat washing station will open for public viewing and use at the city’s marina on Saturday and boaters will get a chance to learn how to clean vessels properly and prevent transporting species to other waterways. “The purpose of it is to educate boaters about invasive species, so they can clean their boats entering Lake Simcoe and leaving Lake Simcoe,” MNR biologist Greg Lunn said. “Lake Simcoe actually does have a number of invasive species and we don’t want to see them transported to other lakes.” When foreign species are introduced to new waterways, many of them out number and compete with local inhabitants which can result in lower populations of regional species. “They compete and breed fast and generally displace our native species for habitat and food sources,” Lunn said. “The main concern is when they’re leaving because Lake Simcoe is predominantly acting as a source for invasive species.” Some species include: zebra mussels, Asian fish tapeworm, sea lamprey, European frog-bit Eurasian water milfoil and flowering rush. The station will draw water from the lake before going through a pressurized water system on land where boaters are encouraged to wash and thoroughly inspect their vessels. “It uses pressurized water to clean off any larval zebra mussels (and others species) that may be on the trailer, on the boat or anywhere they may cling to,” Lunn said. “A lot of the time it’s hard to see where they cling to so it’s important to wash the vessel.” Boats will have to be washed one at a time, but Lunn said the station doesn’t have size restrictions and can accommodate small to large boats. Boaters can visit between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. to learn more about washing boats and how waterways are damaged by foreign species, but also how transmission can be prevented. “It’s to continue to increase the education among the anglers and boating community and stop transmission,” Lunn said. “There will be educational pamphlets, materials and decals for the people who utilize the boating station.” MNR staff will be on hand to answer questions and give out free fishing lures as tokens for those interested in learning more."

796751,dhickey,2013-07-06 03:56:00,1038,To little to late. No Kidding.  MNR damage control. But for what its worth. Keep your boats clean and don't transport bait  . Even ignorant people have fishing licences never mind guns. Or driving licences for that matter.
