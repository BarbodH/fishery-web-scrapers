796905,BLOO KANOO,2013-07-07 16:04:00,20,"Has anyone fished for bass on the Lake Ontario shoreline? I'm not talking about Quinte or the other bays in the area, I mean out in the main lake. I have been curious about this for a few years.  I may not catch anything, but I want to give it a try. Does anyone know of a good place to start between say Port Hope and Belleville? If you have tried this let me know.  Thanks."
796908,Rich,2013-07-07 16:23:00,3927,There are smallies to be caught all along the shore of Lake O.. early mornings seem to be more productive. Good luck
796909,Christopheraaron,2013-07-07 16:32:00,3525,YES! Haven't tried out there but if you can find a rocky point you're in business!
796911,Garnet,2013-07-07 17:07:00,2056,"Everyone of the piers Port Hope Coburg, Bowmanville rocks all have smallies around during the summer. When we were kids we walk the shore to Bonnie Bra shoal in Oshawa to catch smallies. Just takes some work."
796918,BITEME,2013-07-07 17:31:00,1968,Their everywhere their everywhere!!!!!!!!
796948,krixxer,2013-07-07 21:09:00,274,in PC the 'ol Texaco point bay has a few fat ones
796951,fishindevil,2013-07-07 21:16:00,6254,Lake Ontario has huge massive smallies !!!!!! It's the secret as everyone goes to Erie for smallies but lake o has monster smallies !!!!! And most people will not give up their lake o spots but the further east you go the better it gets  and all around the Kingston area it's amazing but between Toronto and coburg there is some great smallie areas if you can get contour maps of lake o and know what the bottom composition is you can figure it out !!!!! I have got some brutes at both the Darlington nuke plant and the Pickering nuke  over the years !!!!!

I tried my best NOT to catch smallies at the nuke plant. lol They were infested with 5-6 lb smallies.  Any obvious structure, river mouth, pier will give you a good chance of a smallmouth."
796986,BLOO KANOO,2013-07-07 23:40:00,20,"Thanks Guy's. I'll check some contour maps and find a spot close by. I thought there would be, but wanted to get another opinion. Thanks for the info.  "
796993,dave524,2013-07-07 23:58:00,4508,"Not just smallies too, I live on the south shore and have got more incidental largemouth shorefishing than smallies."
797079,jbailey,2013-07-08 13:43:00,866, really?
797155,buick14,2013-07-08 22:40:00,741,"Shore fishing Toronto lake o bass will make you rip your eyes out.  So much good looking, and yet surprisingly dead water.  Lol change your focus to coarse fish and you won't be disappointed if you peg some smallies while goimg for monster drum lol.  Your location is probably a different story...."
797197,ehg,2013-07-09 01:05:00,2666,"You need a boat to look around. lol Cleaned up in past at Rouge R., Duffins Creek areas. Shore casting sucks for everything except carp."
797262,Rich,2013-07-09 11:29:00,3927,"Lol... Its a great lake. It's got a whole lot of productive shore fishing. Ignore those that got skunked there before and blame the location. Make no mistake, its a fish factory with bigger smallies than anywhere else has to offer."
797283,BillM,2013-07-09 14:48:00,17367,"Let's wait for the thread in a few years about how Lake O has been crap because there are a million guys out there fishing for bass/pike, lol.      Some guys just never learn I guess."
797290,ehg,2013-07-09 15:31:00,2666," Lake Ontario fished out of bass and pike? lol. Give your head a shake! A decade ago posts on bass/pike in Lake O maybe brought maybe a  half dozen extra people to islands with there spincast outfits throwing bobbers with worms, or Red Devils. No need to alarm without knowledge."
797303,BillM,2013-07-09 16:43:00,17367," Hey,it's not my home waters, I really don't care   Enjoy it while it lasts.    Don't be surprised to see the tournament trail end up there."
