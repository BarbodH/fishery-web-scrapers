This has been professionally wired in with a converter box,seems i get power and signal coming out 3 wires to drivers side but nothing from 4 wires going to passemger side coming out of the small black box. Just wondering if i spliced in a new box would this solve the problem? thanks"
796891,Terry,2013-07-07 14:05:00,14456,"I don't know the unit but most times they just plug into the vehicles wiring harness , so one set of wires should be going into the box  and the other wires should be going to the trailer  and if the is the case it is pouched"
796893,bow slayer,2013-07-07 14:51:00,1074,seems i found the problem...there are no relays in fuse box for towing....tried CT and princess for relays and no luck ....anyone know where i could buy relay fuses ......thanks
796899,Bill Shearer,2013-07-07 15:14:00,456,"If it is a Ford, the relay is usually shipped in the glove box. Don't know why they dont put it in? At any rate my last 3 F150s came that way Pick it up at the dealer tomorrow, or make a jumper for today. Beware though in the event of a short you could do some serious damage."
