797097,chris.brock,2013-07-08 16:00:00,4053,"Day 1  Gord, Cam and me headed out Friday, it started raining almost immediately, we couldn't find the trail we needed and spent close to 4 hours running around, getting soaked.  Here's Gord wondering why made him decide to come out here, BTW, his Kodiak 450 is likely one of the best machines for this type of riding      We finally did figure out where the trail was but it was too late in the day to make the run and fish, we were all pretty tired and wet   Day 2  Sunny, hot day me and Cam set out again.  Here's Cam crossing a wet section (I wouldn't be surprised if RyanMc recognizes this spot       We get to the lake, hit the water, and what do we find? A solo paddler hiding out. Nice guy, didn't catch his name. We pulled our maps out and shared info    An old cabin    fishing was good for the middle of the hot, sunny day, the biggies eluded us though     cooling down, the surface layer was like soup     pikerel fry at Cam's yesterday    gotta love summer at the cottage"

797266,Tim Mills,2013-07-09 12:35:00,476,"Nice to see your efforts rewarded with some fish.   When is the "" Chris Brock Backlakes Mapbook"" coming out?"
797275,4x4bassin,2013-07-09 13:52:00,1025,"Love the back lake reports , thanks !"
797296,lunkerbasshunter,2013-07-09 16:12:00,2585,back lake bassin!  Awesome!
797422,sleepjigging,2013-07-10 02:45:00,207,"I second the "" Chris Brock Backlakes Mapbook"". Maybe exclusive to OFC  Sleepy"
797459,chris.brock,2013-07-10 16:07:00,4053,"   I don't think there will be a book coming out anytime soon, we're pretty tight lipped, when people around the bay ask us where we are going or where we were, we always say ""Scrabble Lake"" even though that's not true, kind of a running joke  ""how do you get in there?"" - ""oh, a really rough trail back that way"" ""how's the fishing? - ""hit and miss"""
