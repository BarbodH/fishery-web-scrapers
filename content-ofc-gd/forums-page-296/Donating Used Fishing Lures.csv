797027,Andy,2013-07-08 02:01:00,330,"I have accumulated a number of lures that I no longer use, mainly pike and bass stuff like weedless Rapala spoons, older Rapala rattle baits, older style weedless frogs, and more. Instead of hoping to sell them, does anyone how a fella can donate used lures to a club or charity so that kids could use them? Andy"
797032,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-08 02:32:00,8243,"Yes, if you are in the Hamilton area the CYO will greatly appreciate any donations at Lake Niapenco ( Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority )in Binbrook. The kids will greatly appreciate any sports related items. They are on the phone book under conservation authorities. I will check for the number and the name of the nice lady managing the reservoir in the morning. They will take anything from baseballs to bass plugs.  Johnny D.  A wonderful gesture by the way Andy. As well for any of the folks out there that want to contribute to this solid organization where we know the donation of hardware goes right to the kids that need to get out of the inner city for a few hours they really need fishing line."

797406,SirCranksalot,2013-07-10 01:32:00,3291,Andy--- a fine gesture on your part. A better destination than where I donate my lures----the river bottom!!
797418,Andy,2013-07-10 02:34:00,330,"Oh, I've ""donated"" a few that way too. The most recent one was a brand new musky bucktail. A backlash on the second cast ever with the new lure and it flew far into the distance and sank into the depths of the lake, never to be seen again."
