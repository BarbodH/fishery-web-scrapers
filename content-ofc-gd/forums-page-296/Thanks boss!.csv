Wasn't all that productive, but this largemouth pulled out of a small river was a nice change from rock bass. Released safe and sound. I've fished the spot before and only caught RB and a chub. Used an ultra-cheap spinner and got it hanging around an old fallen tree. Surprise surprise, who would ever think of a largie in a spot like that?[/sarcasm]  "
