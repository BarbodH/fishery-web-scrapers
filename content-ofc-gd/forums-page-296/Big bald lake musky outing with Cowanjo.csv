He told me there was one around where we were as I was running a bit behind and he had some time to fish that spot alone, not 5 minutes later does a nice 36 incher smash his lure and on it was, what a fight! this was the fish of 10 casts today lol    caught and released after some pictures, the girlfriends family were trolling behind with us and I know they were all jealous I was in his boat not them lol.  so we set off following his route all the while he was just a wealth of information helping me in every way possible (even letting me use his favourite lure haha) working our way around all the weed edges there was some activity but nothing came of it until about 8:25 or so.    nabbed a 44 incher he made it look easy but I guess it comes easy when you know as much as this guy does the girlfriends father was amazed at how much he knew of the lake as was everyone else - better than the back of his hand.  So all in all it was a fantastic evening and an excellent learning experience, thanks again to all of you who let him know I was looking to go for some musky it didn't disappoint one bit I will definitely be going to the musky meetings in Hamilton he told me about! Thanks again John I had an awesome time!"

796898,Musky or Specks,2013-07-07 15:12:00,2710,I've only met John once but he's a great guy and very enthusiastic about musky fishing. A great person for a beginner to get out with.
796900,leaf4,2013-07-07 15:16:00,2466,yeah he was definitely a good guy to learn from and talk with he seemed to know everything haha valuable experience for a first time out - man are those rods sweet lol
796904,Rich Clemens,2013-07-07 15:54:00,3131,Sweet - congrats in a couple beauties
796910,Gregoire,2013-07-07 16:33:00,1397,John is a great guy to fish with. The only problem is that he catches most of the fish. The problem with the LT musky sticks is that once you use them you wont want to use anything else.
796982,Joey,2013-07-07 23:20:00,9122,What a great way to spend the day. Learn a few things and catch musky!!!
