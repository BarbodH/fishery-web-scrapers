794880,Lord Letto,2013-06-26 13:58:00,70,"Hi, I'm a New Member here, My name is Jeremy, i'm a 24 Year Old SWM, I Currently Live Between St. Agatha and Waterloo, Ontario But i'm originally From Newfoundland and Labrador, Moved to Ontario back on September 1st 2001. I'm Not really into Fishing that much but that's due to the fact that I don't have my own vehicle and my family don't fish often But I Will be heading up North on Saturday for the Canada Day Long Weekend and the Following Week With My Family to Loons Landing in Alban on the French River (Dry Pine Bay), We Will be Renting a Cottage and a Boat while there and hopefully there will be a Lot of Fishing and Fish Caught this Weekend. My Question is, Has anyone been up around there lately as in within the week to last month or so that can give some kind of fishing report? As For Gear, I Have my Brothers Old Silstar 78-4642-4 Rod With a Brand New Shakesphere Durango DSC8(DurangoSC15B) Closed Face Reel That Came with 8Lb Line on it and some Fake Bait (Berkley Gulp! Alive! Nightcrawlers  and a Leach/Minnow Mix (http://www.berkley-fishing.com/products/soft-bait/gulp-alive/jumbo-leechminnow-assortment & http://www.berkley-fishing.com/products/soft-bait/gulp-alive/nightcrawler-gulp-alive) and might pick up some Live Worms when we get there."
794881,TJQ,2013-06-26 14:07:00,7806,Welcome aboard... what did you want to fish for??? or does it matter??
794888,Lord Letto,2013-06-26 14:32:00,70,I'm Hopeing to catch some bass and maybe a Pike or 2 But it doesn't really matter as long as I have Fun.
794891,Walleye72,2013-06-26 14:51:00,156,"Nice to meet you.  I'm in London, so not too far from you!  I don't have a recent fishing report for you, but I can offer some very basic tackle suggestions.  You'll need a few jig heads for that Gulp.  Gulp is good stuff btw.  Also, an Erie Dearie would make trolling with that gulp or worms easy.  As for pike, they're not generally fussy.  Red Devils, Williams Wablers, Jointed Rapalas  are all safe bets.   The Devils and Wablers are inexpensive, start with those.  And don't forget a package of 6 inch steel leaders.   LOL  Good Luck with your vacation.  Walleye72"
794898,Christopheraaron,2013-06-26 15:31:00,3525,"welcome aboard! Can never go wrong with a few spinnerbaits, and the often overlooked inline (mepps, vibrax)."
794917,misfish,2013-06-26 17:38:00,29133,"Another bye from da rock. Welcome.   ^^^^^^^^^ WILL GET YOU BY NO PROBLEM,and the vibrax, is a great bait as well."
794918,Freshtrax,2013-06-26 17:44:00,2215,Find rocky points that drop to deep water  and jig away.... Always works for me on the French also shallow diving crankbait a at dusk will also produce walleye . Good luck
794962,Lord Letto,2013-06-26 22:08:00,70,"well I'm not really into lures, normally just put the bait on a hook, attach a bobber and cast, but my brother got lures and stuff, I don't know what kind he got though. I also never mentioned but he picked up a lowrance Portable Fishfinder we'll be using also (Mark-5x I think?)."
794967,chris.brock,2013-06-26 22:26:00,4053," I'd take Freshtrax's  advice,  a rocky point, or somewhere there is current (river flowing), just beside the current, try to be in water 8 to 20 feet deep (you don't want to see your bait 3 feet below your boat), put a dew worm on, hold it just off bottom and see what happens, you never know what species you're going to hook into on the French, but the rockbass and small mouth bass should give you some action"
794969,davey buoy,2013-06-26 22:35:00,5505,"Welcome!,that fish finder will be your best friend.Look for drop offs,work the edge as stated.Live bait you can't go wrong with ,you'll usually catch something!!. Good luck."

796868,Rich Clemens,2013-07-07 10:06:00,3131,"Nice mixed bag you were able to pick up.  Used to use those Williams for Pike up on the Rideau.  On one of our trips, that seemed to be the hot bait."
796870,Rich,2013-07-07 10:22:00,3927,"Hey looks like you and your family got into some nice fish and had a great time, thats what its all about!  I like the vibrax spinner you chose. Have caught everything from trout to musky on them."
796886,NAW,2013-07-07 13:41:00,4022,"What zone where you in??  If you where in zone 10.. No problem.   Zone 11, you need to give your brother a stern talking too!!"
796895,Christopheraaron,2013-07-07 14:55:00,3525,"^^what he said. Also, good lure choice, but a little small for pike, I got 17 pike and a bass last week on a #5. Looks like a good trip"
