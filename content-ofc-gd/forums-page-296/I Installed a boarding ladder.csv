794811,glen,2013-06-26 01:30:00,2641,Got a ladder from bps for $82 +tax.  Can tire had SS bolts $15. The ladder is not as heavy as I would have liked.  Its aluminium and ss would have been nice. But I have not tried it on the water yet.  Compact and folds up nice.  I went with the bolt on because I don't have any room in my boat for a temp ladder.  Terry dont get this one I had to drill eight holes.  Ya I slept on that thought first.  
794842,glen,2013-06-26 04:39:00,2641,And here it's folded. 
794843,tb4me,2013-06-26 05:18:00,3295,Nice I have to get one for our boat too
794870,outllaw,2013-06-26 12:38:00,1232,"glen...smart move. folks never think if someone falls over,how to retrieve them. great for the ole swimming holes also. they are mandatory on all charter/guide boats in Ontario."
794897,cityfisher,2013-06-26 15:16:00,959,must have on anyboat...esp for the peeps that cant pull themselves back into the boat without one !
794916,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-06-26 17:18:00,535,My uncle caught one of those while trolling for lakers on Monday. A little grimy but in really good shape once cleaned up a bit.
794919,doubleheader,2013-06-26 17:54:00,497,I have the same type ladder. Do yourself a favor and wrap a bungie cord around it so it won't deploy by accident.
794921,Roy,2013-06-26 18:00:00,13728,"A very useful safety item to have indeed. What's important also, especially with a family, is to take them out to a quiet bay and go for a swim and have each member of the family use the ladder at least once. Using a boarding ladder for the first time under duress is not the easiest way to learn."
794927,bare foot wader,2013-06-26 18:45:00,1354,"definitely a safety feature most people don't have on their boats....I would like a full ladder like that, but instead I have a 6' length of rope attached to a cleat on the transom and is rolled up and held with an elastic, it tucks neatly away in the rear corner....the rope has 2 loop knots, one at the bottom and a second mid way up....if I go overboard I can easily reach and grab the rope, unravel it and put my foot in the loops and use my legs to push myself back inside....the only improvement I might do is to take a 6"" length of pvc pipe to the loops, so they are easier to insert the rubber boots I am usually wearing in bad weather  just a question, because I might end up bolting on a ladder like that....when you used those SS bolts, did you use a rubber washer to insulated the SS from the aluminum? or do you need to?"
794931,davey buoy,2013-06-26 19:18:00,5505,Glen similar to mine.Wouldn't be without one.Things can change in a second.  .
797144,Matt Janes,2013-07-08 22:18:00,49,"Hey Glen,  Just wondering if you had a chance to try out your ladder? I am thinking of getting one to install on my boat and just wanted to make sure it supports a half decent amount of weight and you can actually get out of the water with it.  Thanks  Matt"
797156,glen,2013-07-08 22:41:00,2641,My kids and I tried it many times and it works great.  The bps reviews are good too.  It's a small ladder so one foot per rung.  On a 18' plus boat you could use a bigger ladder.
