796863,Cudz,2013-07-07 05:02:00,2652,KNOCKED OUT!  That is all
796864,buick14,2013-07-07 07:39:00,741,Good I'm glad to hear that
796873,Terry,2013-07-07 11:22:00,14456,"he is amazing, cocky, but I was happy to see him drop......."
796874,Jigger,2013-07-07 11:29:00,1237,"Wow, not what I expected to hear waiting for the coffee to brew!"
796875,Terry,2013-07-07 11:37:00,14456,"he was taunting and pretending a hit hurt him, hands down and he got clocked, you could see his eyes roll back, and down he went"
796894,Christopheraaron,2013-07-07 14:51:00,3525,I don't watch at all but I never would have put money on him.
796922,boombap,2013-07-07 17:55:00,310,Christoper.. Why not? Lol.  It's good to see him finally lose a fight.  I still say GSP > silva
796924,Terry,2013-07-07 18:06:00,14456,"he said no more title fights, but to drop down  in weight and fight GSP would be a fight I would love to see"
796945,woodenboater,2013-07-07 20:38:00,2277,"Honestly, I don't find his fights that exciting except for his cockiness and although I didn't see it, am glad he got handled.  Wish Mayhem didn't go off the rails, he was fun to watch."
796949,Pickeral eater,2013-07-07 21:14:00,155,"Never thought he'd go down!! Gsp is next, hasn't looked overly impressive in his last few fights."
796957,Lunatic,2013-07-07 21:56:00,536,"it was crazy never thought id see the day. you can see weidman getting discouraged and mifed at some points with AS clowning around. he got caught and thats all it takes. edgars fight delievered ,but frankie ususally does"
796963,ehg,2013-07-07 22:26:00,2666,Ya only GSP is revered like Anderson Silva was Maybe the young Canadian guy Rory Macdonald will eventually take out GSP. lol
796983,brw,2013-07-07 23:24:00,101,"I'm a huge Silva fan but no matter who you are--athlete, politician, etc--when you think you've reached a station where you think you're invulnerable, life and karma have a way of leveling things out. In retrospect it appears that he needed a few PSI released from his inflated head. Bigger question is what he learns from it...."
797271,206,2013-07-09 13:28:00,563,"he threw the fight he wants out, I hope he lost some purse for that."
797276,TJQ,2013-07-09 14:04:00,7806,"Funny Wiedman made 48,000 for that fight.. Anderson 600,000.... lol.. Even Roger Gracie, in his FIRST UFC fight on the under card made more than Wiedman.. ($50,000) and he lost!!"
797323,davey buoy,2013-07-09 18:25:00,5505,"TJ,wasn't Gracie the Anderson of our time now,I'm thinking the money starts rolling in now for Wiedman?.to win a match like that ,he'll get his turn."
797351,Jigger,2013-07-09 20:51:00,1237,"With bonuses, Weidman topped at 98,000. Reports were also that the UFC would more than likely top that up privately as well. Weidman won't be hurting for cash anytime soon. Especially when it comes time to negotiate a rematch!"
797371,SirWhite,2013-07-09 22:49:00,210,"Everybody gets old and loses its nature taking course. Silva was pissed of that the other guy landed decent shots and didn't drop his hands. He tried to provoke him and ended up looking like a complete fool. Did anyone else notice the HUGE Nike endorsement? His shirt said ""Anderson Knows"" lol I guess it's still only Bo who knows"
