Approximately 24 Liters were pumped into the tank which already held about 25 Liters of diesel fuel. Truck was driven 1/4 mile back to company yard. Do you think any damage was done to engine or other parts? Truck has been towed to repair shop. Thanks for your thoughts on this. npt1."

It's when you've got just enough diesel in there for the truck to run (but not stop) that you get into big repair bills.   A 1/4 mile isn't much and depending on the size of the fuel filter none of the gas could have even made it into the engine.  Best thing to do is drain the tank, flush the fuel lines and see what happens.  Diesel is also heavier then gas is so again, hopefully near the bottom of the tank where the fuel pickup is, nothing but diesel got pulled through the system.  Whatever you do, don't let the mechanic bend you over for unneeded repairs.."

Driver made it about 400 feet and into 3rd gear when the hood blew off. Gas doesn't like being compression detonated at 22 to 1 !
