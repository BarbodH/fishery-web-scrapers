797402,dhickey,2013-07-10 01:13:00,1038,Work has kept me extremely busy since the ice went out and with the exception of the May long week end I haven't been fishing at all. But the rewards of long hours and endless day at wok payed off. My daughter and I left 4.30 Saturday morn for our camping/my fishing spot to join our life long friends and family. As soon as I got there at 8.30am I set up the boat and was told to go fishing and they would look after Erin and so on the water I went. Started looking for the big pike but no luck. So I tried a few of my go to lures and still nothing so I decided to try a lure I bought on the way up on a whim and wouldn't you know SUCCESS. I couldn't get the big ones out to play but the kids had fun. Saturdays morning catch.[url=http://s1198.photobucket.com/user/saltydawg43/media/phonepics212.jpg.html]   .  And finaly smores.   Looking forward to the August long week end when we all meet up again. And another chance to go after the big one lurking.  Don.

797414,Luke V.,2013-07-10 02:09:00,286,All I see is the same pic of the spider
797420,Christopheraaron,2013-07-10 02:37:00,3525,"yup, spiders here too"
797423,dhickey,2013-07-10 02:48:00,1038,Well for some reason I cant get the image of the spider to go away no matter what IMG code I select from photobucket??? Sorry for waisting your time. I did have some nice fish on there but I fear it may be lost now.  Don. Till next time.
797430,Christopheraaron,2013-07-10 03:15:00,3525,"did you get a chance to try ""them""?"
797436,woodenboater,2013-07-10 10:58:00,2277,Is that spider actually kinda big or is this the 'hold the fish out so it looks huge' trick
797448,Headhunter,2013-07-10 13:29:00,5703,"I hope you don't mind, but I named the spider ""Ziggy"". Must be from Mars. HH"
