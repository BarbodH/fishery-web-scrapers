796650,Billy - Curtiss,2013-07-05 17:21:00,241,Heading out of Ashbridge's today at 4:00 PM with my brother for some more chinook action. I have no idea how rain will affect the bite with these fish. Anybody?
796651,BillM,2013-07-05 17:28:00,17367,Wind will have more affect on the fish then the rain will.   Only thing it will affect is you getting wet
796704,redpearl99,2013-07-05 22:34:00,259,how did it go Bill?
796727,steelhunter,2013-07-06 01:07:00,81,Rain will only affect them when they are in the rivers when they go brown
796742,Fishing4Tails,2013-07-06 02:09:00,38,Rain no problem .. Clap of thunder shuts them down and time for you to go home .
796745,ccmtcanada,2013-07-06 02:40:00,7971,The fish do not mind getting wet!  Go get em!

796773,Billy - Curtiss,2013-07-06 13:02:00,241,We landed 20 in total last night. I've never experienced a triple hook up before. So exhilarating! We caught a bunch of little ones as well and they are really quite beautiful.
796776,Christopheraaron,2013-07-06 13:26:00,3525,"Wow, that's a great way to spend an evening!"
797121,Joeytier,2013-07-08 20:22:00,3990,Triple headers of screaming kings are the best kind of chaos

797287,BillM,2013-07-09 15:01:00,17367," Neither, small chinook would be my guess."
