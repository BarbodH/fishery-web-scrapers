796798,Meegs,2013-07-06 17:40:00,249,"Went for a rainbow fish this spring, or at least was trying to catch bows, first fish of the morning was a 5lbs brown, half hour later got a 6 lbs brown, couldnt believe our eyes, 2 good browns in such a short period of time, about an hout later my rod went for a good rip, ten min later we got a quick glimpse of what we thought was a big salmon, nope, was the biggest gb brown ive ever seen,    ive seen more browns the last 4 years than I have in past 15 out of gb. No fin clips, where are these fish comming from? Any thoughts?"
796800,wallacio,2013-07-06 17:55:00,475,Solid Browns!   The GTAA stocks Browns in Georgian Bay...the likely source of these fish.  http://www.georgianfishing.ca/about.html
796801,misfish,2013-07-06 17:55:00,29133,Sure wish they would run up river. LOL  Those are monsters James.
796802,SirCranksalot,2013-07-06 17:57:00,3291,very nice fish. What's that white stuff at your feet?  Were you in a boat or fishing from shore?
796803,Terry,2013-07-06 18:20:00,14456,"wow, nice fish"
796804,spoon,2013-07-06 18:32:00,74,Way to go Jamie !
796813,Meegs,2013-07-06 20:16:00,249,"Brian, they do, only for a week or two but ive caught them up to 14lbs in bighead, seen enough out of beaver and sydenham, to know there around. I remember seing a pic of rick matuzick from the fish eye view of bob izumis show with a 25 lb brown from montgomery rapids area years ago.  As for the white stuff, thats snow, we were  from a boat,"
796814,Roy,2013-07-06 20:16:00,13728,Fantastic! Love those browns...thanks for the report!
796824,glen,2013-07-06 21:57:00,2641,Too bad you didn't get any bows.  Lol. Nice fish.
796829,SirCranksalot,2013-07-06 22:58:00,3291," I think I'd ""settle"" for those browns!"
796837,BFSC Kevin,2013-07-07 00:45:00,1351,That's a beast!
796839,fishindevil,2013-07-07 00:55:00,6254,Awesome browns !!!! Glad to see GB is finally doing better !!!!! Some real nice brownies man !!!! Wow ...
796871,Rich,2013-07-07 10:25:00,3927,"Bows on the decline, salmon collapsed.. nature always puts something to replace whats gone.. now you've got a brown factory!  True beasts there, nice!  I cant get over the snow on the ground. Yesterday was so hot down here I wanted to rip my skin off and jump in."
796878,Tim Mills,2013-07-07 12:43:00,476,Good to hear there making a comeback.  Impressive catch.
796919,BITEME,2013-07-07 17:34:00,1968,That there is some seriously pretty fish no a big trout fisher but always like the look of big bad a$$ browns
796971,ehg,2013-07-07 22:53:00,2666,That is very impressive! No triploid farm escapee there.
797006,dave524,2013-07-08 00:15:00,4508,"I've got the odd one in the river below the dam in the fall on the Beaver going back to the 80's, but never in the Bighead. Rarely fished it but it is my understanding that the Sydenham coughs up a few in the fall below the dam. None of mine were anywhere near the size of that one, very nicely done"
797010,BillM,2013-07-08 00:49:00,17367,"Only brown I've ever caught out of Gbay was in the Bighead, lol!   That's an awesome fish!"
797041,irishfield,2013-07-08 04:31:00,26272,Great shots James... but of course I saw them a few months ago! Guess the secrets out... lol... the naturals are back !
797045,Moosebunk,2013-07-08 05:17:00,3970,"You don't pop in at the sites as often as used to Jamie, but when ya do it's always for good reason.  That's a treat of a brown.  Nice Meeeegers!"
797083,JoshS,2013-07-08 14:09:00,729,That's awesome. Thanks for sharing
797101,FrankTheRabbit,2013-07-08 16:48:00,479,Stellar catch there! Nice to see some big fish up in that area.
797400,bucktail,2013-07-10 00:56:00,1857,SWEET!!!!!!!!!!   Big Browns are so hard to get!  One of my fav fish!
