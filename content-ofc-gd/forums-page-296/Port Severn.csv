Anyone have any sight seeing/waterfalls/beach/swimming spots, things to do suggestions for the area?  Any suggestions within a short drive or boat ride from Potato Island would be greatly appreciated.  Stoked for a week of fishing too!!  Thanks  Steve"

796997,SirCranksalot,2013-07-08 00:05:00,3291,The marine railway at Big Chute is an interesting little sight-seeing diversion.
797003,BillM,2013-07-08 00:09:00,17367,  And a little further west you've got Whites Falls.   Kids will love it.

I remember great times there as a child.Victoria harbour / port mcnicol has an old cruise ship in port. Might be cool to check out from the boat.I also second White's Falls. It's a great place to swim, and you can fish from shore, if there aren't to many people swimming! Just make sure you go visit Paul White at White's Marina and buy an ice cream cone!! Support the locals..."
