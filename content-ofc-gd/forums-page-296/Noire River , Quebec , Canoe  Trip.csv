I was wondering if anyone has done this trip before, and or , what type of fishing there is along this river. We are going for a week so the gear is limited and would like to have the ""important"" stuff.  Cheers Matt"

Trout river or walleye or bass or sturgeon or pike or whitefish or musky or crappie or rock bass or nothing.  HAHA ..I have limited space for tackle as it is week long trek so was helping to key in on a species thats prevalent,."
796791,tip-up,2013-07-06 16:42:00,94,"Your fishing walleye and some nice size smallies. The walleye in this river are so golden in colour, like nothing I've seen before. Good luck and please report back!"
796866,fishindevil,2013-07-07 09:28:00,6254,Yes like tip-up said because of the tanin stained water the backs of the walleye are jet black and their sides and belly are just as gold and awesome !!! The smallies are black too !!!!
