796544,Cudz,2013-07-05 01:53:00,2652,Got out fishing with my dad for the first time in years.  He is getting on in age but still knows how to fish. Pretty cool seeing as he is the one who got me into it in the first place. He caught some huge perch today and some smallies as well. I managed to get into the act as well.  Nice day on Simcoe for sure.   
796545,Sinker,2013-07-05 01:54:00,8692,Nothing beats fishing with the old man  Nice perch for sure!  S.
796554,livinisfishin,2013-07-05 02:21:00,661,Nice report! Going to have to get out with my old man sooner then later!
796557,kickingfrog,2013-07-05 02:26:00,8333,Thanks goodness he as better taste in sunglasses.  Fishin' and fathers and sons go together like peanut butter and jam.

796569,Cudz,2013-07-05 04:48:00,2652,Hey Rob.  I wasn't actually wearing my sunglasses when I caught the fish but I put them on for the pic just for you. lol

796674,NAW,2013-07-05 19:03:00,4022,Great report Cudz!  Last time I fished with my old man is was over 10 years ago.  And unfortunately will never happen again.  But the memories will last a lifetime.
796677,misfish,2013-07-05 19:07:00,29133,Real Nice Chris. He could pass as our local weatherman.LOL

796842,Beans,2013-07-07 01:39:00,3339,"I know how your dad must feel Cudz...My son from London Ont. was here last weekend and gave me a hand launching ""The Tin of Beans"" and we managed to catch four 1 1/2 to 2 pound smallies for him to take to his mother (my 1st wife)..."
797052,Moosebunk,2013-07-08 05:47:00,3970, Learning that more and more.  Great report Cudz.  Nice to get out with Pops.
797158,Skud,2013-07-08 22:49:00,739,My dad always gets his finger in the camera lense too. Nice report
797166,irishfield,2013-07-08 23:26:00,26272,Great stuff Chris... enjoy it to the fullest and don't wait so long next time!
797263,Cudz,2013-07-09 11:44:00,2652,Well it is a bit tough to fish with him as he lives/lived in Alberta.  They are here for the summer and are thinking of moving back as they have sold their place in Edmonton.  I hope this happens for sure.
797277,TJQ,2013-07-09 14:05:00,7806,Good stuff!!
