797267,jedimaster,2013-07-09 12:36:00,3472,Highways are not flooded but some ramps are flooded and lots of sink holes. 35k homes without power in West end of gta. Some subways are closed still
797269,motv8tr,2013-07-09 13:11:00,2587,"I had to work last night, the only subways still closed are from Kipling to Jane due to flooding of a sub station, everything else was back up and running when I left there at 5am.  Glad everyone seems to be ok, up in in Penetang there was only an hour of rain before I headed out to work at 7:30 last night...not sure if it rained again...now it's clear skies and sunshine here...  Hopefully a quieter night tonight..."

797274,4x4bassin,2013-07-09 13:50:00,1025,I was working last night at the airport (Pearson) and I can say I have never seen or worked in rain like that in my life . It was like someone was dumping buckets of water on my head for 2 hours . The airport was in and out of red alerts for 3 hours and the ramp areas were completely flooded ! Crazy weather indeed .
797288,ehg,2013-07-09 15:22:00,2666,Pearson recorded 126 mm of rain to set all time one day record rainfall beating Hurricane Hazel. Once in a lifetime event.
797325,mercman,2013-07-09 19:01:00,7054,so this is why I didn't get my orders from yesterday. Thought maybe there was a snow storm
797330,davey buoy,2013-07-09 19:21:00,5505,"Still Kipling,from Belfield,south to Dixon,and over to Islington lights are all out.4 lane main streets,with a turn lane I may add,treat it as you would a 4 way,well you could only imagine the horns and close calls I saw. People need to wind down a bit.Things take time!!."
797369,OhioFisherman,2013-07-09 22:44:00,6623,"Weather, don't ya just love it? We had a great spring here, then they officially announced the start of summer and the rains started. We are under a tornado watch right now, and I think we have only had 2 dry days since summer started."
797374,Fisherman,2013-07-09 23:11:00,7201,"I hear ya, it seems like it's going t be one of those summers that wasn't.  I don't think we have had one decent rain free weekend  since way back in the spring months.  Sun goes down friday night and shows back up sunday afternoon."
797377,jedimaster,2013-07-09 23:23:00,3472,Last Saturday was pretty good. Got a sunburn while fishing. But yah for the most part it's been really wet.
797381,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-09 23:40:00,10439,"The old saying was: ""what follows two days of rain in Ontario?"" Answer: ""Monday!!!"""
797195,woodenboater,2013-07-09 01:03:00,2277,I'm glued to Accuweather's radar...scroll and zoom and see if your area wins the prize  http://www.accuweather.com/en/ca/ontario/weather-radar

797203,Roy,2013-07-09 01:16:00,13728," Thanks Raf, his house is on higher ground so they should be ok. How's your area Raf? I mean is there a chance of flooding?"
797206,Christopheraaron,2013-07-09 01:21:00,3525,had a feeling that would happen considering the flooding was bad at the highest hills in town today...
797211,dhickey,2013-07-09 01:35:00,1038,Hey Roy its only the centre of the universe that's hit  hard. Other than that Angus/ Milton and Georgetown are on high ground for the most part. East York is genneraly high ground as well. Don..
797214,backbay,2013-07-09 01:39:00,773,Over 100 mm of rain in an hour at Pearson. Saw a report that there is concern that the banks of the Don River may collapse in Hogg's Hollow. (York Mills and Yonge).
797215,wallacio,2013-07-09 01:42:00,475,Some pretty incredible pictures here:  http://storify.com/blogto/toronto-weather-gets-wet-and-wild
797216,Raf,2013-07-09 01:44:00,3495," Not too concerned Roy, we're atop a hill... and the areas in the valleys are well drained.  The upper Grand will be flowing and I could see some areas around Grand Valley have flooding issues."
797218,HTHM,2013-07-09 01:48:00,4082,We are dry in Hamilton.
797224,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-09 02:05:00,10439,There's a gnarly cell heading straight for TO. It ain't gonna be over for a while.
797232,jedimaster,2013-07-09 02:37:00,3472,It's raining now but not hard. I am at 401 and 404. Pretty crazy right now. If anyone here has flooded family pm me. I can make some room and squeeze some people in if need be.
797234,Christopheraaron,2013-07-09 02:56:00,3525,That's very generous of you Jedi!
797237,ehg,2013-07-09 03:08:00,2666,They are saying Pearson airport received 123 mm of rain which set a one day record  rainfall. . It mostly fell between 5-9 pm. Still light rain here.
797238,woodenboater,2013-07-09 03:23:00,2277,radar shows the worst is over for now. Hope they get all the riders off the GO train safely.
797239,irishfield,2013-07-09 03:23:00,26272,Thanks Jedi! Finally got ahold of wife and daughter. Taking 3+ hours for cell phone texts to go through and they were out eating. Not even a puddle on Lansdowne.. apartment dry and power is on. Hope it stays that way....
797242,Freshtrax,2013-07-09 03:46:00,2215,Mud lines should be Pretty good on the north shore
797246,lew,2013-07-09 08:59:00,12766,"My daughter called last night and said it was nasty around her area too (QEW & 427) and the power was out and according to this morning's news there's still around 35,000 without power in the west end.  I'm up in the east Kawarthas and we only had about 15 minutes of very light rain last night, hardly enough to wet the ground."
797248,Roy,2013-07-09 09:46:00,13728,Has the flooding subsided somewhat overnight? I have no news this morning from my people.
797250,fishindevil,2013-07-09 09:58:00,6254,They are saying to call ahead Roy !!! Some transit is still not running the lakeshore west trains Richmond hill and the Milton lines are still down just heard all that on the news just now
797251,fishindevil,2013-07-09 10:00:00,6254,And some bus routes are down too mostly along the lakeshore and bay view areas debris and cars abandoned have to be removed first !!!! Hope this helps
797254,Roy,2013-07-09 10:04:00,13728,"Thanks for the news, Bud."
797256,bigugli,2013-07-09 10:30:00,6138,"Much more of this flash flooding, and produce is going to get really expensive."
797257,misfish,2013-07-09 10:54:00,29133,"They say that more rain came down,then it did during hurricane Hazel."
797258,lew,2013-07-09 11:01:00,12766, I was in Toronto for Hazel and it was definitely nasty.

797179,misfish,2013-07-09 00:05:00,29133,Im wondering how our friend Fisherman is doing in Angus. They got a good flooding as well. You could paddle to the beer store from his place. Rapid style.

797181,Fisherman,2013-07-09 00:11:00,7201,"Hey Brian, the only thing I didn't have was a great big box of Tide otherwise it would have been the foamiest place to be.  50mm(2"") in 30 minutes,  Couple of intersections and plazas were flooded but nothing like Toronto.  I can just see the Pine and Notty tomorrow, Angus to the beach in 10 minutes...."
