796601,HTHM,2013-07-05 14:05:00,4082,"http://www.wellandtribune.ca/2013/07/04/3-killed-in-ontario-float-plane-crash  WIARTON, Ont. - Three Sudbury-area men were killed Thursday afternoon when their amphibious airplane crashed in Georgian Bay as it came in to land at an airstrip on Griffith Island. ""Witnesses saw the plane approaching and a short time afterwards they looked and the plane was in the water and police were contacted,"" Const. Alina Grelik of the Grey County OPP said at the dock in Big Bay. Police are not releasing the names of the victims pending notification of next of kin. Grelik said the men, aged 45, 52 and 72, were related. A coroner was at the scene on the southeast side of the 2,300-acre island at about 6:30 p.m. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada's air division is expected to arrive at Griffith Island on Friday. Grelik said police are unable to comment on the cause of the 1:30 p.m. crash. ""We can't speculate. That's why the transportation safety bureau will be attending,"" she said. Police said the blue and white plane was upside down and partially submerged in the water about 200 metres from shore when they arrived on scene. The OPP's search and recovery marine unit was still on the water Thursday night. The Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre out of Trenton, Ont., had dispatched a Hercules aircraft shortly after the crash. Witnesses on shore at Big Bay said the plane circled near the island for quite some time before leaving. All available resources were dispatched to the crash site, Grelik said. Three ambulances stood by near the Big Bay dock as police and other emergency personnel worked on the water for at least six hours. Several people were near the dock to watch as police boats shuttled officers to and from the island. A Griffith Island boat also took people to the island and brought back passengers who were carrying rifle cases. The island is home to a private sport shooting and hunting club. It features a lodge, 2,700-foot turf runway, private ferry service, lounge and gun room. People hunt pheasant, partridge, wild turkey and white tailed deer."

Just have to see it down safely. Can't expect everyone to do it, but if they hadn't taken their eyes off of it the quicker reaction time may have helped."

Senseless tragedy, that plays itself out over and over again unfortunately. Get your head out of the cockpit and look outside from time to time. DANG !! Condolences to the families.. father, son and son in law.  (oh.. and before anyone gets their panties in a knot, they'll say the same thing about me when I do it in the years to come)"
