796499,Joeytier,2013-07-04 22:24:00,3990,"Just bought an 89 xlt lariat 150.  So far it seems to be a great truck...low kms for the age and relatively rust free (clearly well maintained) with the awesome torquey 302.  Its a 2 banger but its got the trac loc system.  Ive been trying to get some information on these rear ends but cant find too much.  Ive seen them described as positrac as well as a limited slip style rear end, but cant seem to really distinguish what mine is.  I figured at least a few of you would have had some experience with these trucks...  Thanks"
796504,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-04 22:37:00,10439,It's just Fords version of a limited slip differential as far as I know.

796514,Joeytier,2013-07-04 23:24:00,3990,Hmmm...looks like i should get it looked before assuming its going to kick in when i need it.  Thanks for posting
796579,Rod Caster,2013-07-05 10:48:00,5784,2 banger? So the mazda will be still towing you out!
797404,SlowPoke,2013-07-10 01:27:00,2984,"The term ""banger"" is usually used to describe a 4 cylinder engine and I think you are confusing it with 2 or 4 wheel drive. We'll cut you some slack on the ""torquey 302"" comment because if you came from a ""4 banger"", it would seem pretty ""torquey"".  Don't sweat the rear end, just get it serviced and drive it. There's a million of them out there still operating fine probably without any maintenance!  Got any pictures of the new ride?"
797428,Joeytier,2013-07-10 03:10:00,3990,Well shes already in the shop with what i think is a busted ignition actuator...love how easy these trucks are to work on
