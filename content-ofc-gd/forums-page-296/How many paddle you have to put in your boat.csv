796961,CRAPPIE,2013-07-07 22:20:00,213,Do I have to put two paddles in a boat or you just need one paddle.  Thanks!
796962,davey buoy,2013-07-07 22:26:00,5505,"Not sure,but if you have two,easier to keep the boat straight. I've always seen two.Not sure what the law requires."
796965,smitty55,2013-07-07 22:32:00,928,"It used to be that 1 paddle was legal. Not anymore, you need two. Cheers"
796967,Fisherman,2013-07-07 22:39:00,7201,Only one is needed.  http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/debs-obs-equipment-size-menu-690.htm
796968,Musky or Specks,2013-07-07 22:44:00,2710,IN my boat it depends what your doing  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKDnviT0FIQ
796969,Roy,2013-07-07 22:52:00,13728,Only one is required OR an anchor.
796973,kickingfrog,2013-07-07 23:02:00,8333,...With at least 50 feet of rope/chain I believe.
796975,Fisherman,2013-07-07 23:05:00,7201,"It says either, both not required, but, it doesn't hurt, kinda hard to anchor a boat with a paddle or row ith an anchor..."
796976,kickingfrog,2013-07-07 23:06:00,8333,"I was wrong it's 49""3'."
796977,Tootsie II,2013-07-07 23:08:00,162,"I have a pair of oars and one paddle. I my motor conks, nobody rides for free! LOL"
796978,kickingfrog,2013-07-07 23:09:00,8333,"     Mine was meant to add to Roy's post, not stand on its own."
796979,Fisherman,2013-07-07 23:12:00,7201,"Well I'm sure Roy meant with the rope, another kinda hard to hold the anchor and boat when your more than an arms length apart.."
796980,kickingfrog,2013-07-07 23:13:00,8333,"It's also hard to anchor a boot in even 40 feet of water with only 5o feet of rope. I always figured it was so that as a unpowered boat got close to shore the anchor would finally ""catch""."
797008,smitty55,2013-07-08 00:33:00,928,"I totally stand corrected. I thought for sure that had changed. I want two anyway, for dual paddling in case of trouble. As if a single paddle could do very much saving a heavy boat in a strong wind anyway. Cheers"
797013,glen,2013-07-08 00:53:00,2641,This post makes me want to have twin outboards cause I know I ain't paddling.
797015,wormdunker,2013-07-08 00:57:00,1711,Very good !  You have way too much time on your hands!  LOL!
797017,Fisherman,2013-07-08 01:09:00,7201,"Hey, it's sunday night, the icecream buckets empty, no chips, the wife won't hold still,...."
