I attempted to locate it through the search option at the top right corner of the main page.  No results after entering several different words such as battery, deep cycle, marine battery, boat battery.  Am I using the search option properly?  Could someone direct me to the discussion for deep cycle batteries? Thanx  Good luck fishing this week end, I'm working??"
796764,Roy,2013-07-06 10:45:00,13728,What did it mostly talk about? Wiring? Charging? Types? ??  I have a bunch of them here....approximately how long ago was it...was there much participation to the thread?
796834,Lunatic,2013-07-07 00:12:00,536,i bet it was the one about a month ago.someone bought a battery that would die in 10 minutes after a full charge. it had a good conversation about deep cycle batteries. i couldnt locate the topic on search either
796835,Lunatic,2013-07-07 00:16:00,536,"ah,i believe this was the topic. was it this one?  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=69908&hl=battery"
796838,wormdunker,2013-07-07 00:47:00,1711,"Hey Roy it was about better deep cycle batteries.  Nautilus seemed to win over all others from members replies.  Although the post by Lunatic is very informative.  It was approximately 2 months ago.  In the post it mentioned the ""battery minder"".  I'm impressed with the minder, thinking of ordering one, a little pricey but if it will save prolong the life of my batteries it's a good investment.  Thanx for your help"
796880,bigbuck,2013-07-07 13:00:00,2449,Kirkland from Costco are good as well as the batteries from Walmart. Keep them charged and full with water and they should last quite a few years.
796913,Garnet,2013-07-07 17:11:00,2056,Cosco's ECO is less if you don't have battery's to return.
796921,Dabluz,2013-07-07 17:53:00,701,"I took part in that discussion. I was the one who had the battery that did not have more than 10 minutes of reserve.  Anyway, the quality of deep cycle batteries is closely related to the price of the battery.  There aren't that many companies making batteries.  If a person wants a deep cycle battery, he must be certain that it is not a hybrid battery or a starting battery.  A deep cycle battery has caps that can be removed in order to top up the cells with distilled water.  Only an intelligent battery charger will completely recharge a deep cycle battery.  The user must have a hydrometer to check the specific gravity of each cell.  The best thing to do is when you buy a deep cycle battery, you charge it to 100% and you check the voltage of the battery and the specific gravity of each cell after it has rested for a few hours.  You note the readings and after each recharge, you compare the readings.  If the battery liquid levels do get a bit low, top up with distilled water and charge the battery and take readings again after a few hours rest.  Try not to discharge the battery to less than 50% of it's capacity.  For those who use their electric motors a lot, they would be better off buying 2 batteries because they will save money in the long run.  Buy the largest batteries.....at least 180 minutes of reserve....better yet....over 200 minutes of reserve."
796923,Rich,2013-07-07 18:04:00,3927,I can attest to never letting go below 50%.. have had two spiral cell nautilus batteries that are amazing after two seasons using this method.

You'll never have any problems"
