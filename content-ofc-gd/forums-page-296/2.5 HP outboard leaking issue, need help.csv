But when I open the cover, inside the engine is pretty clean. Why is that, will it affect the outboard performance? Where is engine oil leak from?  Thanks in advance!"
796915,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-07 17:23:00,10439,You stored the motor incorrectly. It's a 4 stroke and they need to be stored correctly or the engine oil will leak out. Either store it upright or (usually) they are required to lie on one side only. It will say in the owners manual. Most small 4 strokes I've used require being laid down on the side of the tiller handle if transporting.  Check the engine oil to make sure is within' the safe zone since you had a leak. Top up if low and you should be good to go.
