I might go back with Olympus since the one I had was pretty good in bad weather and survived some real wild trips . What do you guys think ?"
796856,sofabed,2013-07-07 02:51:00,119,I use the Fuji finepix. It works well even under the water. Battery life is good as well
796869,Rich,2013-07-07 10:13:00,3927,"I vote Fuji FP as well. Great cameras , great battery life. I dunno if olympus has changed but they used to make you buy battery packs seperate, kept me from buying one."

796935,tbayboy,2013-07-07 19:17:00,1497,"I'm using a canon d10, simple, affordable, battery lasts forever and shock/water/abrasion/etc proof.  Zoom sucks but other than that I've been very happy with it (and it help up well in salt water during a barbados trip so I'm sure its fine here)."
