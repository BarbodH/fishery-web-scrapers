796616,fisherman7,2013-07-05 15:52:00,325,"I've used on for years, but I don't ice fish. Good for still fishing and for trolling but anything above trolling speed they won't say in the holder. The sidefinder is an interesting feature as well. Doesn't show structure - just fish."
796627,davey buoy,2013-07-05 16:29:00,5505,"Thanks for the reply.From what I see,down image shows depth, structure,and fish.The side scan as you say looks like fish and depth that all I can see so far. Should work great for a second finder or portable.Going to try it tomorrow. 45 hours on 3 C batteries. I can live with that. Already thinking where to buy a small 12v x4.5v dc converter lol."

796867,davey buoy,2013-07-07 09:29:00,5505,"Tried mine yesterday. Did everything I wanted a portable to do.The price I got it for,well that was a steal!Good luck with your new portable Frank 81!"
796903,Frank,2013-07-07 15:48:00,74," Awesome, all that matters is that it works for your needs and I am sure the Fishin Buddy 2 would suite my needs too. I just walked in the house from fishing all morning, my Humminbird 175 worked great also, there is a lot of carp in the river I was fishing in and they were registering on the finder no problem, seen some huge schools of them. The most useful part of it is the depth and water temps for me. All we caught was some pan fish today, as we couldn't go down the river too far because the wind was blowing my canoe all over the place, was still a good day to try out the finder and cast some lines."
