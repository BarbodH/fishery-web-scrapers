797049,Moosebunk,2013-07-08 05:41:00,3970,Having it put into words TJ makes it that much more interesting.  Kesagami is an incredible gem in our Ontario north country.

795372,TJQ,2013-06-28 14:54:00,7806,"Finally got a chance to post some of this stuff.  We went up to Kesagami Wilderness Lodge last week for a 5 night trip, to eat some shorelunches and mayhaps get that big pike on weve been looking for.. and do some underwater video... AND get a chance to see Avery, who is working as a dockhand this summer there!  We got to Cochrane, and checked in at the best western.  Im sure that there are nice places other than the Best Western, but the last time we were in Cochrane, I cheaped out on the motel, and well.. lets just say for only the second time in my life.. we left a motel without checking out.. and wound up at the best western anyway lol.  Top notch accommodations and a continental (really nice) breakfast available at 6 am so you can make the drive to the airbase by 7 am which is when they start flying out.  Quite convenient.    The flight in is about 45-50 min depending on headwind so we climbed into the Beaver and away we went!  The scenery was awesome.  Our Pilot          Promptly upon arrival, we were treated to a full breakfast while the dockhands bring the luggage to your room/cabin.  This dockhand seem genuinely happy to see us!!    It was a cloudy day, but not Raining so our guide Brandon for the day grabbed us and out we went for some pickeral fishing!  We were only out for three hours before lunch but managed at least 60.    AS the weather started to degrade we deiced it was time for shorelunch, which the guide prepares... I gotta say after getting over the discomfort of not helping clean the fish or cook the lunch, being catered to was kinda nice!!  We pondered the fact that life was good!  Poor Brandon cooked us up a feast in the wind and rain!        Warming up by the lunch!!  LOL    The wind picked up so after lunch we found a quite spot, put on some spoons and just trolled around for a bit.  Was suprised that even in an area that wasn't ""spot"" we managed to pick up pickeral on our spoons!    and they all went back in!        After an afternoon like that we sat back and let our guide get us safely back across the lake where we retired to our room before dinner for a beverage.    Then with BBQ Ribs on the menu, we sat down and had the pleasure of sitting next to these gentlemen.  I told them Id make them famous.    A quick view of the sunset and it was time to call it a day!    We deciedd to strike out the next day on our own and explore some parts of the lake that we hadnt been guided to.  WE didnt get the same amount of fish, BUT there's literally no where in that lake along the shoreline that you can catch fish.  It was a beautiful sunny day and we made the most of it.    With enough fish for lunch we descended on a beautiful beach, and did up our lunch!!          Our Favorite dockhand had a few hours off and offered to give us a little tour of the lake...  Momma was happy to have some face time!!  Hes looking great, happy and is doing a bang up job!! (Im told!!)    After and afternoon of that we went back, had a wonderful supper, once again watched an incredible sunset and got ready for the next day!      For the next three days we booked a guide, one of the more senior ones, Stuart.  We should have gotten aguide that couldnt fish.. because it rapidly descened into a competition as to who could catch more fish him or Monique.  I am not at liberty to say who won... lol....  The next day started with us going out and getting what we needed for shore lucnh in short order.  then staying and catching and relasing at least 60 more before going to lunch.  The lodges policy is 2 pan size pickeral for lunch per person and everything should be on a single barbless hook.     And then the best time of day... again!  He cleaned hem while we kept fishing... (I almost wept with joy ... ok... ok.. I wept with joy)    then prepared us a fantastic lunch. Lemon and herb spiced!!        "

795450,kickingfrog,2013-06-28 21:26:00,8333,I don't know about that. I think there might be a plumber in Virginia that wakes up with bear nightmares every now and then.

795486,Ron,2013-06-28 23:55:00,1683,"Looks like way too many chits and giggles were had up there. To see a fishery like that, how can you NOT have a fantastic trip. I hope you tuned them in about the whiskey n ice. That there is almost a deal breaker on a return visit! hahaha.  cheers, Ron..."
795603,MCTFisher9120,2013-06-29 20:33:00,3761," Do it Roy, it's heaven man flat out....the lake is loaded with fish.
