Sometimes by the species of fish present you can kind of imagine what sort of lake it is... shallow and weedy, or deep and rocky... and so on. But I was looking at Pigeon Lake, which I am quite familiar with... but I saw 3 species of fish which I have never caught nor witness being caught... or even heard tales of. Brook Trout, Burbot and Northern Pike... Now I know Northern Pikes are moving into the Kawarthas, but I haven't heard them making it as far as Pigeon so far... and the other two seem like Bull. Anyone ever catch a Burbot or a Brook Trout on Pigeon??"
