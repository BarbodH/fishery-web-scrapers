689084,Roy,2012-04-21 21:40:00,13728,Great report Arthur! I really like those blues compared to the flat heads. Is this the year's maiden trip for the big boat? The bass doesn't look too shabby either eh? Thanks for the pics!
689088,misfish,2012-04-21 21:53:00,29133,Some nice fishing there Art.
689092,aplumma,2012-04-21 22:02:00,6896,The boat made it thru the winter with no damage after dewinterizing  I turned the keys and it fired right up. I did a shake down run last week before loading people on board just in case there was an issue. The bite was good the hard part was holding the boat right with the current being tidal and a strong cross wind the drift sock was the only reason we could put any lines out.  Thanks all  Art
