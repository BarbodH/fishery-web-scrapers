I have been out on a couple of various Kawartha lakes and been finding fish moving in and out of of area's on a daily basis. That coupled with the northern wind blasts have made for the slow bite the past few days. Employing super Ultra-light line and baits and a very stealth approach has been so key in getting better bites and boxing some quality fish. Clearer water this spring has meant light lines and smaller then usual suspended plastics under a small float for success. Also, adding a bit of scent and leaving the float in one spot longer then usual has accounted for more fish this year so far! Until the water warms up and we get a few days of stable weather the bite will be slow so exercise the above tips and have fun landing some nice fish!! Attached is a pic from this past weekend.. enjoy!... Greg. "
