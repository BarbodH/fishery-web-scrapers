689193,Big Cliff,2012-04-22 08:32:00,6899,"Got up, got my coffee, let the dog out and it's snowing! Water temp had dropped by 8-9° from Friday evening to yesterday afternoon. I have a feeling we are just about back to normal (perhaps even a bit below) for this time of the year."
689196,Billy Bob,2012-04-22 09:45:00,5865,It always averages out to within .5 degree by the end of the year...
689198,Big Cliff,2012-04-22 09:59:00,6899,"If that holds true, we are in for a very cold summer because this winter was way above normal! Just checked the weather network and we are a good 5°C below normal for this time of the year."
689202,Skipper D,2012-04-22 10:54:00,1970,"It might as well be snowing  Cliff, we have a real heavy frost this morning , the lawn is completely white ."

689484,lew,2012-04-23 10:56:00,12766,Starting to get a bit of wet snow falling over my way now and the weather dood says we may get a few inches.  My wife leaves in 3  hours for a 2 week cruise across the Pacific to Hawaii and told me she's sorry to hear about the lousy weather approaching us but she really doesn't care and sorry for my bad luck.
689485,mercman,2012-04-23 11:22:00,7054,  Amazing how fast they`ll turn on us
689486,lew,2012-04-23 11:31:00,12766, Just no sympathy at all Paul
689487,woodenboater,2012-04-23 11:38:00,2277,Imagine how annoyed she'd be if her flight was grounded lol
689492,Harrison,2012-04-23 12:35:00,2202, The seas can be mean - as you know Lew! lol
689497,Billy Bob,2012-04-23 13:09:00,5865,"NINE WORDS WOMEN USE... (1) Fine : This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up.  (2) Five Minutes: If she is getting dressed, this means a half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.  (3) Nothing : This is the calm before the storm. This means something, and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with nothing usually end in fine.  (4) Go Ahead: This is a dare, not permission. Don't Do It!  (5) Loud Sigh: This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you about nothing. (Refer back to # 3 for the meaning of nothing.)  (6) That's Okay: This is one of the most dangerous statements a women can make to a man. That's okay means she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.  (7) Thanks : A woman is thanking you, do not question, or faint. Just say you're welcome. (I want to add in a clause here - This is true, unless she says 'Thanks a lot' - that is PURE sarcasm and she is not thanking you at all. DO NOT say 'you're welcome'.. That will bring on a 'whatever').  (8) Whatever : Is a woman's way of saying...Go to Hell...  (9) Don't worry about it, I got it : Another dangerous statement, meaning this is something that a woman has told a man to do several times, but is now doing it herself. This will later result in a man asking 'What's wrong?' For the woman's response refer to # 3."
