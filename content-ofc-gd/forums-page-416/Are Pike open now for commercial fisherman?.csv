I witness a 22 ft commercial fishing boat with Bins of different fish species ,no rod with them, so I pressumed the fish were trap. Lots of dead pike on one bin, sunfish and blue gills on another bin, other fish on other bins which I did not witness since they were stacked, there were roughly 12 bins where each bins only carry one species of fish, I can assume the other bins have other type of fish, another lady was with the two guys on shore, she had a note pad and itemized what were being caught. No clue if she was buying the fish, or just recording what was being caught for whatever purpose.  I did not have the MNR tip line, but the 2 guys on the boat that saw me approach their boat, seem to be over friendly, was watching me every so often when they were unloading the fish. I approach them asking where I can catch Carp in the area.  I still have their plate number and type of truck on record."
