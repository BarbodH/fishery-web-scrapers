689062,muskymatt,2012-04-21 20:14:00,2608,"I've got a trip planned for the Friday the 27th to portage into Algonquin park(Brent access) for trout opener and will be staying till Tuesday. A couple of portages involved but we'll hit a couple Trout lakes. Looks like the area is going to have a possibility of 15cm of snow next week..lol...should make it interesting. I've got my usual blue fox, crocodiles, husky jerks and cleos that are proven to work. Any other suggestions on tackle? We'll be traveling light as the portage is not on the easy level."
689065,Leecher,2012-04-21 20:32:00,7832,"Even though your a Sens fan    God    that really is painful   I'm willing to give you some insights on some additional tackle that you'll require for trout     Black fury spinner #2 dressed is killer for speckle trout     3"" White power tube tipped with dew worm is killer for lakers also   but don't take my word for it... I'm a Laffs fan"
689068,muskymatt,2012-04-21 20:43:00,2608,"Thanks TJ, I'll try those and include them in my report. On a humorous note, just because you're a laff fan doesn't mean you don't know fishing. LOL Again, much appreciated!"
689070,Leecher,2012-04-21 20:48:00,7832,No worries Muskymatt... Good luck in the park
689087,camillj,2012-04-21 21:53:00,1988,Black Whooley Buggars ... on top ... trolled swiftly ... just saying
689091,solopaddler,2012-04-21 22:01:00,8605,"Worms will save your bacon if a cold front moves through.  Snow early next week, but there won't be anything left by opening weekend.  High of 9 for Sat with temps rising steadily from that point on, to well into the mid to high teens.  Unless things change the weather will be perfect."
689096,danc,2012-04-21 22:29:00,4677,What kind of trout??
689101,SirCranksalot,2012-04-21 22:46:00,3291,In my experience the specks won't touch anything other than a fly once the Mayfly hatch has started.
689105,Grimace,2012-04-21 22:58:00,2020,It is good timing for you.  The Sens will be toast by then so you can get on with your fishing year.    B)
689107,muskymatt,2012-04-21 23:14:00,2608,"I'll be bringing a 5wt and a good assortment of flies as well, I plan od doing quite a bit on the fly"
689108,muskymatt,2012-04-21 23:15:00,2608,"Tonight might tell eh? Trouts on the 28th. First trip of the year,can't wait!"
689150,Sinker,2012-04-22 01:58:00,8692,"Might not be too many bugs for fly fishing by then.  I'm headed north tomorrow. The weather is nasty, but what can ya do. Worst case, we burn all the firewood in the cabin and run out of booze  I already packed a snow shovel  And 3 sets of rain gear  Bring worms for sure. Spinners and worm harnesses worked just fast enough to turn the blades will get 'em, even in a cold front.  S."
689151,BillM,2012-04-22 01:59:00,17367,"Specs can't resist worms, if a cold front moves in you'll need to force feed them, they won't be moving for anything.   Don't forget the worms!"
689165,northernpike56,2012-04-22 02:24:00,717,mepps black fury #1 orange dot. you can tip it with a worm too.
689232,Rod Caster,2012-04-22 13:39:00,5784,X4 on worms. Small inline spinners tipped with worms is the way to go for picky specs
689233,muskymatt,2012-04-22 13:47:00,2608," Our #1 presentation is #1 Blue fox or Mepps Orange inlines with worms,on a planer board. The worm box is full, also some Martins in the same color scheme, seems orange is the preferred but I've also got some pinks to try.  And always blue and silver."
689237,muskymatt,2012-04-22 13:57:00,2608," Brookies and Lakers , most trout for that matter open on the 4th Sat in April. We'll be targeting Brookies, with lakers being second."
689239,danc,2012-04-22 14:13:00,4677,"There's lots of good advice here for you Matt, but one thing that I don't see on the list are Rapala Countdowns for Specks. I wouldn't want to even guess how many Specks I've caught on them. Size 3 or 5 is just about right. I always remove the front treble because it just gets in the way and can make a big mess in your net if you are using one. I've also caught my share of Specks with small Canadian Wrigglers. Good luck and post a report when you get back."
