689206,Fisherman,2012-04-22 11:47:00,7201," Hahahaha, my wife went fishing yesterday, she snuck out and went to Johnnys.  MMMmmmm battered Cod and chips.  I didn't get cold or cranky, no stinky fingers and even managed a slurp of beer from the left over for the batter mix."
689217,Harrison,2012-04-22 12:20:00,2202,"Odd man out here probably, but I am not much of a dawn/dusk fisherman.  During this time fish are roaming and willing to chase to eat, this is why horizontal baits are used to cover water and find these active fish.  This also makes them easier to catch hence the ""better fishing""  I am more a vertical, structure based angler.  I like when the fish move to structure and hunker down for the day.  These areas change daily/hourly depending on the sun and light penetration.  After some time on the water figuring out the techniques and areas they move to you can catch fish all day long.  P."
689235,Dave Bailey,2012-04-22 13:54:00,1641,"I love both dawn and sunset, but it may be because those are both such lovely times of day whether you're fishing or not. Wetting a line is just gravy. But they are also the times when the water is often still, and since I love topwater action it's the best time for watching a popper get engulfed.   This is totally unrelated to the topic, but I loved this one on the same page:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzKQkLfz2_Q&feature=related"
689243,NBR,2012-04-22 14:35:00,163,"IMHO Generally:  Walleye: Low light conditions, waves, cloudy, morning and evenings.  Pike; Early evenings.  Perch; Mid morning a little chaop always helps.  Smallmouth: Morning and evenings but some times a great bite in the middle of the day.  Largemouth: Like small mouth but not as often a mid-day bite."
689299,mike rousseau,2012-04-22 19:12:00,4661,"  Very true... It feels good being able to catch fish when it ""should"" be slowest...or not the popular time to fish...like catching bass at night...or walleye in 12 feet of crystal clear water on a blue bird day... I think it's the ability to catch under the less then ideal conditions that puts an angler at the next level of fishing...if you can do good during the ""slow"" times then peak periods are a breeze..."
689302,Moosebunk,2012-04-22 19:17:00,3970,"Great thread.  Checked it out to see who the ""Pros"" are."
689310,mike rousseau,2012-04-22 19:24:00,4661,  That's the only reason I made a reply... I wanted to be considered a pro...lol...
689339,Dave A,2012-04-22 21:04:00,34,Just before day light is what I like best.
689340,misfish,2012-04-22 21:04:00,29133,"  LMAO Erich  I did well today C&R, and stopped by Johnnys for some smoked trout for the kiddies and a few scalls for tonights dinner for the mrs,s. I hit the riv on the new moon."
689350,Skipper D,2012-04-22 21:15:00,1970,"  The new moon was last night , how do you do ??????????i see no pic's"
689369,grt1,2012-04-22 21:57:00,638,"I should be able to answer this, because today i went fishing for 1.5 hrs and when i came home i thought my wife called me a pro, at least i think it was a pro, i do know it started with ""pr""."
689371,misfish,2012-04-22 22:08:00,29133, I am doing well.Pics are posted.You need to go fishing.  :wallbash:
689046,Skipper D,2012-04-21 19:27:00,1970,"I have no clue , if it was left up to me i'd say in the morning ,  but i would like to know : do fish bit better in the morning , or do they bit better in the evening , or dose it even realy matter ?"
689048,pike slayer,2012-04-21 19:30:00,1177,what species of fish?
689050,BillM,2012-04-21 19:35:00,17367,Way too many variables to have a simple answer to this question
689051,bushart,2012-04-21 19:38:00,2628,Yes
689052,GbayGiant,2012-04-21 19:42:00,1780,Fish eat at different times every day and night. If they didn't they would starve. Opportunity is what makes them full or not.
689053,Skipper D,2012-04-21 19:43:00,1970,"ok , then since i'd like to fish for bass,walleye and perch and maybe some others this year dose that help for a start ?"
689054,bushart,2012-04-21 19:47:00,2628,Skipp  As The Bill Man said---way too many variables  not only with species---water temps in spring--spawning----cover----  One lake the bite is hot in the height of day---another it's in low light  every spot needs to be treated individually   One consistent I can say----Find the food source---you'll have your target nearby
689055,Big Cliff,2012-04-21 19:52:00,6899,"That is a good question but I don't think there is any easy answer. I do find that walleye seem to bite best just before dark. If I fish walleye off my dock I won't get a bite until close to sunset. The bite will last for anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour and a half but when it quite, that is it for the night. Under the right conditions I've hammered them at 2:00 in the afternoon when the sun was shining.  I have seen times when crappie fishing that you wouldn't get a bite until the sun was high over head. Other times you wouldn't get a bite until the sun was setting.  As others have pointed out, too many variables!"
689058,Skipper D,2012-04-21 19:53:00,1970,"When you say find the food source , what exactly am i looking for ? Man i have lots to learn , i thought this was going to be simple ."
689059,misfish,2012-04-21 19:54:00,29133,"All I know is,,,,,,,,,,,,I didnt fish today,so that means,when I fish tomorrow,I should of been there yesterday."
689060,lew,2012-04-21 20:03:00,12766,I only fish for muskies but my best times are   as the sun breaks over the horizon in the morning and then the hour before and after sunset.
689067,davey buoy,2012-04-21 20:41:00,5505,"If you can find the schools of minnows off shore,drop a line there,and see what happens?."
689069,Leecher,2012-04-21 20:45:00,7832,Sun up and sun down are best IMO    In mid day... fish fry are awesome
689072,misfish,2012-04-21 20:57:00,29133,  You stole that from Red Fisher.
689075,Leecher,2012-04-21 21:03:00,7832, No I didn't   From personal experience
689090,camillj,2012-04-21 21:59:00,1988,"As dey say in Kaybek ... its depennn on da situation of dat  What I like to call the ""witching hour"" can happen at almost any time of the day (although it does seem to happen both early in the morning and around sundown most often) ... the secret is to be there when it happens ... and when it does - you'll know ... everything will suddenly come alive ... the birds, the bugs and of course the fish ... it'll last anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour and just as suddenly as it turned on it will turn off again ... thats whay us die hards spend so many hours on the water  ... those few magical minutes make the whole day worthwhile !"
689102,muskymike,2012-04-21 22:47:00,772,Possibly
689110,beagle dad,2012-04-21 23:51:00,224,i have fished many tourneys..fish can be caught all day long... they are feeding different areas different time mile high sky is my favourite this will usually position fish in shady areas...logs.weeds.rocks..this will usually narrow the areas to look..not unlike humans  an umbrella and a cold drink on a hot day is where you find us
689166,Skipper D,2012-04-22 02:25:00,1970,Thank you every one for sharing
689172,danc,2012-04-22 02:34:00,4677,I follow the moon.
689175,manitoubass2,2012-04-22 02:50:00,11391,"The bite never dies, it only relocates.  How you figure out when and where is up to you, and will dictate how well you fare.  Some of my biggest walleyes come in shallow water 3-6FOW, on sunny days, around 1-4pm.  Go figure."
689192,mike rousseau,2012-04-22 06:10:00,4661,"Depends on lots of things skip...  Fish with ""night vision"" like walleye and musky can be caught 24 hours a day... But for predators like this I've found in most cases they bite best from supper time (5pm) till a bit after dark...  Perch always seem to bite better in the morning... Like 1 hour after sunrise till 10 or 11 am...  And scent feeders like carp and catfish are also 24 hour feeders... But even with them I find evenings good for cats and mornings good for carp...   Hope this helps a bit..."
689197,Billy Bob,2012-04-22 09:50:00,5865,HANDS DOWN....MORNINGS....here's proof.... 
689200,Skipper D,2012-04-22 10:47:00,1970,I posted the question up on the board because i realy did'nt know if the answer would be the same for all species . It makes sence now . Thank you fellows for helping me out .  
689204,Gregoire,2012-04-22 11:41:00,1397,"Some really good answers have already been given. Another thing I think should be considered are the light conditions of the previous day. If it was overcast and dark all day the day before I would consider going out first thing in the morning the next day as the light transition may trigger fish to feed, however if the opposite were to occur I would not rush to the water."
