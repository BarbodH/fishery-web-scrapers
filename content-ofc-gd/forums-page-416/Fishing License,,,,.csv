I do have the temperary license that I printed out but it sucks having to carry around a piece of paper everytime I go fishing.

The place I used to get my license from before doing it online would ONLY take cash, a tackle shop, you are buying stuff and a license, had to be 2 transactions and now they no longer sell licenses........

I am an actual issuer of hunting and fishing licenses, and from where i am at i am seeing a ton of misinformation and flat out lies being spread buy other issuers. I hate seeing this misinformation spread like it is the truth as it paints all of us that are trying to provide you guys with a service in a negative light. I understand that this system can be a hassle to you guys, believe me, i have to deal with this machine 12hrs a day 7 days a week.  "

688546,hirk,2012-04-20 00:37:00,571,"Gerrit as a past issuer I can say for certain retailers dont skim, like someone said every document is numbered and a dealer must either pay for each one or return those not sold period,no way to sell and keep the money. I can say for sure that it happens all the time that mnr doesnt send out or have a record but its on their end that mistakes get made not the retailer."
689008,Tootsie II,2012-04-21 15:54:00,162,"I also am a past issuer from Wally World in Owen Sound, and all the licenses and tags were individually numbered and we had to account for them and the money or the store was on the hook for them. Please note that at that time we only remitted at the end of the month so the paperwork for any license bought at the start of the month didn't get sent to the Ministry till 4 or 5 weeks later. Add their processing time into the mix and I'll bet you could be looking at an 8 weeks delay in the purchased getting their cards if it was applicable. That's why when I had to renew my fishing license for 1 year in 2012 I went to a Service Ontario outlet. If they can't get it right, who can? It took about 5-10 minutes from the time I got to the counter. I won't say how long it took to get to the counter though.LOL."

681015,chessy,2012-03-28 14:41:00,610,in Virginia they input your information on the government system and when you go to any store you can get a replacement for free. and when you buy license its good for one year from the date of purchase .. not like in ontario my daughter turns 18 in june and she has to pay full amount for fishing license

681028,Grimace,2012-03-28 15:34:00,2020,NYS is great to deal with.  I do it over the computer.  It arrives a few weeks later.   I think Ontario's system (once running smoothly) should turn out similar.  I had a pain getting my Ontario outdoors card this year as my printer took a crap so I couldn't print out the temperary and they offered no email receipt and didn't ship until Feburary. Hopefully things will get better.  Just growing pains I guess.
681031,woodenboater,2012-03-28 15:39:00,2277,It's a small thing but at least the renewal site suggests saving the receipt and licence as pdf's to be printed later as some members have done. I just hope the csr is right and I get my card in 20 days from this am.

681076,Fish4Eyes,2012-03-28 17:26:00,1022,Interesting....now it becomes clear to me why a certain shop only issued me a fishing license if it was payed cash when they had debit available. I thought the MNR kept track of the number of temp slips they give out to tackle shops so I didn't think much of it.

It did take longer than the paper & sticker method used to - noticed the guy had to input my address info twice for some reason.  Still, it wasn't 15 minutes from start to finish and now I'm legal for this year according to what I'm carrying. Think for next year I'll just do the 3 year thing (oops - lost my card!) and be done with carrying 2 pieces again, for now I'll just hit up my insurance company for another of those cheap vinyl pink slip wallets to carry in my tackle satchel  Michael"
681433,BillM,2012-03-29 12:24:00,17367,Embrace the computer folks and take the shady dealers out of the equation..
681504,DaveMc,2012-03-29 14:28:00,89," nothing but hearsay. he told you what he ""thinks"" is the reason for digitizing the license process, not the actual reason.    lied to you again, the fees arent much considering the time we spend on them, but if you bought a card and one year sport tag, he made almost $2, a far cry from $.25.          as i said, my understanding as an outside issuer is that they moved to an electronic system to eliminate the ""middleman"" so to speak, the information entered into the new system automatically updates the outdoors card centre and the MNR's files (which by the way, outside issuers DO NOT have access to), instead of an issuer sitting on the paperwork for 4-6 weeks, then sent to the district office where it is double checked for accuracy and then sent to the outdoors card centre to be processed and keyed into the system.  for the original poster, there were too many links in the chain to just blindly blame the store you bought the license from, and for a retailer to tell you they ripped you off and that a lot of small license issuers were doing this and skimming off the top is incredibly unprofessional and inaccurate. even with the old system of doing licenses the MNR were able to track every single license they sent every single issuer and any that weren't remitted still had to be paid for. The government gets their money one way or another."
681553,cheaptackle,2012-03-29 16:00:00,849,"One thing the walmart guy did tell me that the money went to the MNR electronically from Walmart's account to the MNR at the same time the new tag was printing, as in BEFORE I had actually paid for it.  The MNR database was updated at the same time to reflect that I had purchased the tag.  Without a doubt this is better for the MNR than any previous delays due to mailing or even lost mail.  Like anything new, though, it's off to a rocky start and smoothing out.  Compare it to any new release (with associated crashes) of the Windows operating system over the years, and it doesn't seem so bad.  Michael"
681624,Gerritt,2012-03-29 17:52:00,6129,"Well, DaveMC it is obvious you have never dealt with the retailer I mentioned. They have a very poor reputation. Add to that I am telling you what the issuing retailer told me. The owner of a small Home Hardware ... so if he tells me he makes .25 cents I have no reason not to believe him. (1 year conservation license) Nor do I have a reason not to believe him when he states alot of other retailers were not remitting due paid to them back to the MNR... I know of 2 stores that no longer issue fishing licenses because of this.  Add to that some retailers are just getting out of issuing licenses all together as it is not very profitable for them, plain and simple.  All the Best,  G."

I said no it was never mailed to me... he looked everything up on their MNR ""terminal"" and they stated I had not renewed my card according to the MNR...? What the hell? I paid the money for the new card at the same time I renewed my license!  He said to me and I quote...  There is a reason the MNR has moved to this new system of issueing fishing licenses... it is because ALOT of places were accepting the fees associated to obtain a license....

Waited 20 minutes for the sporting goods worker to get back from break...  She gets back... Punches in my info... And tells me I don't currently have a license... What the heck????  I said I bought it here last fall ... And she was the one that served me that day....  She said I must have bought it in sept for the season ending the end of sept...  I know 100% that I bought it there after sept... So I'd have it till the end of sept 2012...  Now I'm flipping because I know she screwed something up and she's blaming it on me saying I must be mistaken...  So I'm gunna dig up my credit card statement to see when it was purchased.... And talk to the manager at the Walmart... Maybe they will just give me a new license...because I don't wanna pay the $70 again... That would be $140 for 1 year license....
680840,solopaddler,2012-03-28 02:28:00,8605," I feel for you man. I doubt it's a common occurence as far as not remitting fees go though.  Fish Ontario didn't have the greatest rep to begin with, looks as though it may be about to get worse.     You should be flipping, because NY State allows you to buy the following years license well in advance of Sept 30th.  Anyone buying a non resident license in Sept should automatically be assumed to be purchasing the following years license.  At the very least she should have asked.  If that mistake was made it should have been obvious though, the year is printed right on the stub.  Tough luck Mike, hope you sort it out."

""skimming off the top"" and this is why the MNR has put this new system in place to prevent people from being scammed.  Everything is now done electronically through the MNR I saw the website he was logged into etc. that is the only way do get the license now... it ensures that the MNR gets the moeny due to them. atleast now I know I am legal... which I may not have been last year when I thought I renewed everything though fish-ontario.... This is good for the MNR... but bad for folks that have been screwed thinking they were legal.... but might not have been if the paperwork was not submitted.

Previous years my card was exactly like an Ontario resident with 3 yrs stamped on the back of the card.
