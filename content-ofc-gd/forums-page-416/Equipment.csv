Abu currently still makes the winch model(4.6:1) and high speed model(6.4:1) I'm looking for 5.4:1 model. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"
689263,uglyfish,2012-04-22 16:31:00,981,"Check ebay, or start calling some tackle stores. Not sure where u live, but in hamilton, there's fishing world, bills bait and tackle, grimsby tackle and burns tackle in burlington.  All of which hold a good stock and u may find what u want."
689361,Dave A,2012-04-22 21:34:00,34,i'm assuming you've tried JB's?
689415,captpierre,2012-04-23 00:23:00,2521,Didn't know they discontinued the Revo Toro.  Anybody know why?  I bought one 2 yrs ago.  best musky reel I've ever had.
689422,Gregoire,2012-04-23 00:48:00,1397,"Apparently there is a new aluminum frame reel coming out from abu. They actually stopped making the revo toro's in lefty's, only the revo winch is available in lefty. With that in mid I would like to hijack this thread and announce that I am looking for a high speed revo toro 61 if anyone would like part with one."
689435,scugpg,2012-04-23 01:04:00,1373,Do they have gear kits for them? If you really need the regular gears maybe its possible to swap them?  What about a calcutta te instead? Aside from cost aren't they similar in ratio? Very good reviews on them
689461,Gregoire,2012-04-23 02:27:00,1397,"I have heard rumours of gear kits. The problem is that with the purchase of a new reel and a gear kit you probably would be looking at the same cost of a TE. While a TE is a better reel according to most people, it is also a similar ratio to the regular revo toro, not the high speed one."
689477,BucktownAngler,2012-04-23 04:40:00,582,Hello Grew  Welcome aboard! These reels can be hard to find.  be to call all the local tackbest bet wouild le shops to see if anyone has old stock or ebay/online tackle shops
689504,Gregoire,2012-04-23 13:59:00,1397,Was just looking online and protackle musky shop in Belleville has some. Here is the link: http://www.protacklemuskyshop.com/cataloguereels.php

689575,rufftuffcuff,2012-04-23 17:59:00,4,Sweet! I'm gonna look into it! Thanks alot fishgreg and liverelease
689677,Gregoire,2012-04-24 00:00:00,1397,"I actually stopped in there today for a bit on my way home and was glad that I did. Got to meet Stacy, who seems like a great guy, and picked up some cool baits and some terminal tackle that I needed."
689740,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-04-24 03:20:00,535,"I buy most of my gear from Stacy, really nice guy and I'll probably end up putting his kids through college.  I wonder why they discontinued that model. I have the winch and the highspeed and I find the winch is great for pulling large bucktails but it can be a little slow at times, it would be nice to have something in between."
