Al did a great job organizing the Day, at least 3 different local Reporters showed up from the Press. Nice to meet some Old & New Friends. Job well done, Lake Huron Fishing Club & Ontario Steelheaders. Thanx & Tight Lines SBK Kincarde Rainbow Trout Stocking Video"
689474,Freshtrax,2012-04-23 04:11:00,2215,What a great fishery.......you guys are awesome my buddy lives in Lucknow and has his pick on any given day of the week. I'm so jealous
689493,bigugli,2012-04-23 12:48:00,6138,"Great work with the school tanks as well. A great learning opp, and introduction to fishing , for the kids."
689554,esoxansteel,2012-04-23 16:56:00,1307,"A world class wild steelhead fishery, that is 2nd to no one in Ontario, well done, great things happen with teamwork and dedication  "
689569,Twocoda,2012-04-23 17:26:00,4130,excellent production of the video...
689605,misfish,2012-04-23 19:34:00,29133,"Great vid.  A few of questions.  I noticed the first dump,the fish were /seem much larger then the second. Is there a reason for that?  Also during the vid,I noticed, not one fish was floating/dead.Awesome   . Of the 60,000,how many will not make it? Is there an estimate percentage put into this?  Is there clipping done,or any marking or something to determine they are stocked fish?   Great job. The Geen is on my list for this fall. Missed out on the spring fish."
689624,Pigeontroller,2012-04-23 20:41:00,2793,Excellent work by some very dedicated anglers!
689630,Twocoda,2012-04-23 21:08:00,4130, it isnt over yet B the droppies that are re juvinated still put up a heck of a fight but dont make good table fare for at least another month once back into in the lake
689635,Roy,2012-04-23 21:25:00,13728,"Really good stuff, Richard! Thanks so much for the video as well."
689639,Realsteel19,2012-04-23 21:44:00,19,Sounds like a good time!
689643,Snidley,2012-04-23 21:55:00,620,"Great fishery for sure, due to the efforts of the clubs that are stocking. It is not a wild steelhead fishery since this is a video of stocking, well upstream to imprint the fish to the Saugeen watershed, and with eggs derived from wild caught fish. In other words an excellent example to follow all around the province and one that has created a fishery some say might be as high as 30K returning fish from a low of about 700 fish not that long ago. Unfortunately this model is not the one being followed in most places around Ontario, if it was we would be enjoying large numbers of trout and salmon in most of our rivers not just a few."

689670,misfish,2012-04-23 23:32:00,29133,"Thanks for the response,s Truely a great effort."
689673,spinnerbaitking,2012-04-23 23:36:00,1622," I believe the reason it isn't being followed is because we are allowing it not to happen, if things keep going the way they are at the Saugeen as fisherman we need to get together & put pressure on the people that make the changes, join the Ontario Stealheaders &/or your local clubs so they can afford to keep up with the raising of the Rainbows, Browns & Salmon, if they take the Salmon Quota away from us lets have the Membership Numbers to put pressure were it needs to be to get the Eggs needed to improve the Fisheries, I'm still a Bass & Pike fisherman 1st but the Salmon School Program is sure catching a lot of youths attention  & on May 1st the one school is going to have a Video crew there to get footage for a DVD that will be sent out to all Boards so I've been told, how many Schools could have this program if the funding is there, Education & Fisheries seem to go Hand & Hand Tight Lines SBK"
