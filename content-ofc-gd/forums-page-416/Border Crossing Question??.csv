689800,BillM,2012-04-24 13:38:00,17367,"Absolutely, as long as everyone has their passport you'll be fine.."
689803,vance,2012-04-24 13:50:00,719,You might want to check with the company that you are renting the van from and see if you are allowed to leave the US with their vehicle.  vance
689806,whiskywizard,2012-04-24 13:54:00,305,"  This is a good warning from Vance. Almost all US car rental companies prohibit bringing their rental vehicles across the border due to some customs/duty liability. If they tell you it's OK, get it in writing.  Here's the link to CBSa's info for visitors to Canada. Info for visitors"
689812,beerman,2012-04-24 14:13:00,118,Just called the border ... They said its fine to drive a 12 passenger van... Thanks everyone!!
689819,whiskywizard,2012-04-24 14:44:00,305," Agreed, Canadian Customs and Border Services Agency doesn't care that it's a 12-passenger van. They clear hundreds of vans, trucks and buses every day.  But that's not the issue. The issue is whether or not it's a rental van. Most rental agreements prohibit US rental vehicles from crossing into Canada.  if you discover this problem only after you get to the border, yit will screw up your trip.  You need to talk to your rental company, not CBSA.   Edit - added the history I learned of this issue right after 9/11. Many Canadians were stuck in the US when so many flights were grounded. They rented cars and tried to drive home, only to get stopped at the border. Some understanding border agents let them cross, but that happened only because of the unusual circumstances."
