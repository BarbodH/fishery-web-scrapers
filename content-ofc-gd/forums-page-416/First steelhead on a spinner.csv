689421,mikeseb,2012-04-23 00:46:00,201,"So i decided to see if I could fool a steelhead with a spinner this morning.  Success!!  After having 3 fish spit my lure while they were in mid-air I managed to land this guy.  Defiantly a challenge fighting these fish on a 6ft medium action rod with a med-light action reel!  Cant wait for next weekend, im getting sick of the crowds and the mess!!  Every time ive been fishing the last few weeks ive brought a grocery bag with me and every time ive left with it full of garbage!  Most of it being worm containers and other fishing related garbage!!

689425,Joeytier,2012-04-23 00:53:00,3990,Steelhead on light bass tackle are so much fun.  Beauty fish buddy!
689464,krixxer,2012-04-23 03:12:00,274,Were you casting? When I get lazy and fishing good current like the Niagara. I like to set up a #1 mepps on a drop shot.
689490,azebra,2012-04-23 12:06:00,168,"Beautiful fish! that must have been a blast on a stubby rod! and I second the garbage mess, I dont know if people treat their home like that or if their mentally ill.. but its gotta slow down to a STOP LITTERING! I know some are reading this who do!"
689495,torco,2012-04-23 12:56:00,656,Steelhead on spinners are so much fun. My favorite way I think to catch them especially when they are hungry!
689508,steel&chrome,2012-04-23 14:14:00,46,Nice Fish! Commend you for cleaning up the junk people ignorantly leave behind!
689516,BillM,2012-04-23 14:24:00,17367,Nice fish!  Although they don't like laying on rocks
689549,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-23 16:40:00,10439, They don't like being boiled in oil either Bill.
689555,d_paluch,2012-04-23 17:02:00,343,nice fish man!  I still need to take you up on your offer
689594,Twocoda,2012-04-23 19:09:00,4130, i dont know....never had one complain yet
689602,young_one,2012-04-23 19:33:00,620,What size and model spinners do you use? I've had plenty of success with #2 or #3 Mepps Agilia in copper red or gold. I usually fish the frog waters and very often you'll get some nice browns that come into the river.  Fenwick 10'6 UL + 1000 size reel + 6lb line!
689626,davey buoy,2012-04-23 20:51:00,5505,"Very nice fish,and good job with the lures!!!. That's how I have caught them in the past ,but lately using my float rod I'm certainly going to catch a descent one soon:whistling:.I can feel it.!!"
689627,misfish,2012-04-23 20:55:00,29133, Stop sleeping in.
689707,MJL,2012-04-24 01:09:00,2427,It's hard to beat the feel of a steelhead pounding hardware. Nicely done
