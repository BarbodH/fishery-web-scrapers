688483,mercman,2012-04-19 22:37:00,7054,"I was out on the deck earlier with the dogs, and caught a movement out of the corner of my eye.My Maple trees, all 3 of them, were fuilled with hundreds of small 2-2.5 inch black and red butterflies.I have neen here for 12 years now, and have seen small migrations of Monarchs, but never anything like this. The neighbors trees too I took a few pics, but they were all in the tops of the trees and hard to make out.I dont own a telephoto lens Has anyone else experienced this?It's pretty nice to see it.
