688816,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-20 22:10:00,10439,  'Cause he'll DIE!!!!  Or swell up like a balloon!!!!
688820,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 22:21:00,5865, NICE OUTING....want to trade for some perch.....  ...need something for the smoker....  The gill plates are clipped here in NYS to show they are our fish....so now  you must trade those fish....LOL....no really....NYS has clipped the plates for years.  Now go catch some more....  Bob
688822,Joey,2012-04-20 22:37:00,9122,"Wow, way to go, nice fish"
688823,misfish,2012-04-20 22:39:00,29133," Not again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  BB and I are cool. I like to ask why ?  Why would they do that? Dont give me cause it,s to know it,s an American fish.  Clipping fins I can see.  Time for a movie and popcorn."
688825,Billy Bob,2012-04-20 22:43:00,5865, The NASCAR guys came up with it....did you notice it's always the left gill plate...LOOK ANOTHER LEFT TURN.....
688827,Moosebunk,2012-04-20 22:45:00,3970,Man!  You're gonna have alot of fun with that new rig to go play in.  Bring on the nooks!!!
688902,MJL,2012-04-21 01:36:00,2427,"Nicely done guys  Great way to Christen the boat. Now when I see lakers and float suits in one picture, it's hard to imagine them coming from anywhere other than an 8 inch hole.LOL"
688904,SirCranksalot,2012-04-21 01:42:00,3291,"Bill,  Just out of curiosity, was that Lake Huron(Geo Bay?). I hope that's not revealing too much of a secret."
688906,danc,2012-04-21 01:43:00,4677,What a great outing Bill. With any luck you'll take me out for a spin in that rig sometime this summer.
688907,wallacio,2012-04-21 01:53:00,475, We were out off the south shore of Lake Ontario
688910,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-21 02:11:00,10439,  South? That's a long drive Dave.  Down by St. Kitts?
688911,wallacio,2012-04-21 02:15:00,475,"Yup...off Port Weller to be exact.   It's certainly a long haul, especially for Bill but that's where the fish are right now."
688917,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-21 02:35:00,10439,  Yep. We used to go down there to fish the spring derby years ago. We would moor my buddies 36' Hatteras in St. Kitts and drive down to fish.
688927,BillM,2012-04-21 02:59:00,17367," You know where to find us!  Beer will be nice and cold, we owe ya a few  Dave: My oldman and I used to fish the St.Catharines Game and Fish annually when we lived in St.Catharines..  My fav place to fish however has got to be the mouth of the Niagara.  You never know what you're getting into out there!"
688929,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-21 03:03:00,10439, Yep. The area between the canal and the Niagara was always the best for me. Off the rifle range was good spot.
688940,BillM,2012-04-21 03:34:00,17367,"Old man never liked trolling in front of the range, lol!"
688955,corvette1,2012-04-21 10:14:00,1765,nice day on the big o
689252,Leecher,2012-04-22 15:44:00,7832,Great start to your fishing season Bill   Some nice fish you guys got into     Too bad about missing the big one   Sounds like it was a tank Thanks for sharing TJunkie
688704,BillM,2012-04-20 14:34:00,17367,"Picked up a Lund at the end of last season and have been itching to get it out on some bigger water ever since.  Also picked up a Yamaha High Thrust T8 kicker for trolling duties instead of running the 115 Yamaha main..   Along with the T8, I was super pumped to try out the TrollMaster Pro2 I recently installed for remote throttle!  Davey and I decided to play it by ear, found (or so we thought) a decent window of weather and made the jump!  I'm happy to say the boat and the rest of the stuff on it performed flawlessly,  we took a beating pretty much all day and the boat handled it with ease...   Took us a while to pattern these fish (as we started based upon some advice we got earlier in the week)..  Well they weren't where they were 'supposed' to be so we expanded our horizons a bit until we got into some fish.   First fish to the boat was a 12lb or so chrome chinook, as Davey was clearing the lines, #2 rigger goes off!!   Doubleheader!    There was a really small area where we constantly got into fish, if you were out of it, you were staring at a blank screen.  Had a great time out on the water, in the end the waves just got way to big to do anything safely..  Packed her up and headed home.  Totals for the day were 4 chinooks, 2 lakers and 2 coho..  I lost a big big fish after surfacing and running for about 200-300ft...  I guess that 20 year old Trilene XT needs to be changed!  Here's Davey with the first two.    A nice face shot of the big boy.    Davey doing the honours with the first one I reeled in..    A fat little laker that decided he wanted to play as well.    Dave with another!    The little beast in action!  "
688708,I'mHooked,2012-04-20 14:44:00,525,"Wow, nice looking Silver! That 1st one looks pretty messed up around the gills? Was it worn away or a defect? Looks like a fun outing, congrats on the new gear working as expected."
688711,johnnyb,2012-04-20 15:00:00,3413,"Looks like a sweet setup, Bill!  Got any more pics showing the boat off?  Nice job on the fish too....I love getting out there to troll for those things"
688713,BillM,2012-04-20 15:02:00,17367," He was missing a gill plate.  I've seen a few salmon like that.  Didn't seem to affect him much though, he was the biggest we caught all day, lol!"
688714,fishindevil,2012-04-20 15:05:00,6254,thats the way its done !!!some nice lake 0 silvers !!!
688716,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-04-20 15:11:00,535,"Wow, those are some gorgeous fish! I'd like to get into that kind of fishing. I caught my first 2 lakers on mon-tues so it's a start, but they weren't nearly as large as the one you got lol."
688717,wallacio,2012-04-20 15:12:00,475,That was a great day bud...thanks getting me out there!   There's nothing more satisfying than figuring out a tough bite and then putting some Silvers in the boat!
688718,BillM,2012-04-20 15:13:00,17367,"I'm going to be cursing that last fish that busted off!  (and the fact it took 2 of the spoons I just bought, lol!)"
688720,bigbuck,2012-04-20 15:17:00,2449,Nice way to christen the new boat!!
688727,l2p,2012-04-20 15:59:00,346,Sweet Kings!
688731,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-20 16:41:00,10439,Hey Bill What trolling motor steering connector are you using? Need to think about getting one for my boat.   Almost forgot Nice Feesh!!!
688739,BillM,2012-04-20 17:11:00,17367,"Dave, I believe it's a kit by Goldeneye.  'Goldeneye Panther 55 2600 Auxiliary Motor Steering Kit'"
688742,Rod Caster,2012-04-20 17:27:00,5784,The new boat sounds like a big water winner! I bet it'll see lots of hours on the water this year. Nice fish too.
688744,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-20 17:34:00,10439, Thanks Bill Can that one be left hooked up all the time? Even when one of the motors is tilted up?  I am trying to figure out what to do when I repower my boat. I don't know wheter to add a second set of controls and a motor connector or use a Pro Troll 3 and add the panther electronic steering control. It would be nice if it could integrate with my GPS for auto pilot use when trolling.
688751,Paulus,2012-04-20 17:51:00,522, Very nice! I like!  p.-
688755,davey buoy,2012-04-20 18:11:00,5505,Looks like you had a good day Bill.Let's have a peek at the new boat:clapping:.
688757,BillM,2012-04-20 18:24:00,17367," I thought about a second set of controls as well, but to be honest for what I use it for I can't see it being worth while.  All I gotta do is go to the back, start the motor (it's electric start) and put it in gear.  After that I do everything from the front...  As for the steering rod, I've had both motors tilted up with it attached, but I don't think it's designed to work like that.  I know the EZ Steer which works from the rear of each engine (compared to the front on mine) will work regardless of which tilt positions either of the motors are in.. You might wanna check out that one!"
688761,fishnsled,2012-04-20 18:59:00,3520," Looks like the same one that I got last fall, works great but has to be disconnected when traveling. Not a big problem as it only take a couple of seconds to hook it back up again.  Great day on the water Bill!!  Thanks for the report."
688764,Wolf 3,2012-04-20 19:01:00,134,Nice fish!  Boat is looking good too.
688772,misfish,2012-04-20 19:17:00,29133,Nice fish Bill. Left a bag at your door.
688780,BillM,2012-04-20 19:39:00,17367,You were at the house?  I just got out of the shower like 15mins ago! LOL!  :EDIT: Holy crap man!  I think I'll be set for years!  I got some stuff in the freezer for you
688782,misfish,2012-04-20 19:59:00,29133,"Ya, three tubes will do the big and two for the little guy. No prob. I like those tubes.You can fill up easy."
688783,BillM,2012-04-20 20:25:00,17367,"Thanks man, I really appreciate it.  I'll set you up with some roe for the next year or two, lol!!!"
688788,alphaalpha,2012-04-20 20:53:00,475,"Great report, thanks for sharing!  I can't wait to get out on the big water as well, hopefully next weekend  cheers,  AA."
688791,Twocoda,2012-04-20 21:24:00,4130," Welcome to the wonderful world of rigging for big game....  Curious as to whether  or not you guys are going to eat the fish....if you do im sure there will be some good fish frys comming up this summer  Nice shootin!!!! the fish look great but i cant believe you let that ""greasy boot"" on your boat..."
