689023,johnl,2012-04-21 16:56:00,197,Just wondering if anyone has ever fished with them? I work in landscaping so some time i come across some.
689024,Toad Hunter,2012-04-21 17:04:00,261,I sure hope so ! i just ripped up my entire front lawn because of those lil buggers and got a jar of about 200 in the freezer lol - but I figure they couldn't hurt at least for crappie and other pan fish..i kept them hoping to use them with my little nephew so i wouldn't have to buy so many worms.
