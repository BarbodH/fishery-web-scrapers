688865,lovetofish,2012-04-21 00:12:00,500,Hey guys!  My carpet is ripped and i was going to change it.  But im not sure how to go about it.  Do I have to lift the plywood out or can i even do that?  Thanks in advance!  Lovetofish  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/carpet.jpg  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/carpet2.jpg

Wanted to be able to wrap the carpet, like they did from the factory. Planning on using marine carpet and the proper glue. Hoping I Will never have to touch it again."
689353,Dave A,2012-04-22 21:18:00,34,Probably best to remove the wood and inspect while at it.
689483,Billy Bob,2012-04-23 09:53:00,5865,I did this on a old Starcraft of mine years ago....I primed the wood first before carpeting it....It came out very nice...wish I had pics but back then in the day there were no digital cameras..
