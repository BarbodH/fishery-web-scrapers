689322,LefroyFisherman,2012-04-22 20:18:00,602,Caught the biggest perch I've ever seen today in Orillia. Thought for sure it was a bass until it surfaced. 14+ inches! and a huge girth. Took a bunch of pictures and I'm going to get a Replica made. She was released alive and well too grow even bigger!  I've set the bar high for any other Teams that want too mess with Team #5
