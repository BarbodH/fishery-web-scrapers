688978,ccmtcanada,2012-04-21 13:05:00,7971,"Fishnsled and I were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat last night...and we saw a sign for chicken and ribs special, with this thing called Road Gravy.  Sounded good so we headed over to the bar for some food and to maybe watch the hockey game.  Our dinner was rudely interrupted by this LOUD music...one look over and low and behold, there was our very own Headhunter!      Seriously though, those guys rocked the place with three sets of favourites for everyone. If you have a chance to see Road Gravy in a bar near you, I'd recommend you go and check them out.  Great show Headhunter!  On a side note, it seems that I went to high school with the lead singer...he came over after the show and asked if I went to Ajax High.  He looks completely different now, but after chatting a bit, I remembered who he was...small world!"

689013,Spiel,2012-04-21 16:06:00,9065,"Haven't had the pleasure yet of seeing ""Road Gravy"" but up at Bernie's I've seen some good jamming in a private and stellar environment."

689018,Spiel,2012-04-21 16:27:00,9065, I used to have a few Mike but lost them when my puter crapped out a few months back.  Maybe HH will help me replace them.

We've been asked to play a fund raiser for the Special Olympics that will take place on May 19th in Oshawa... that should be fun and obviously a really good cause.
