682308,Dave Bailey,2012-03-31 18:47:00,1641,"I was looking at it on their web site, wondering if it might be easier to use in the confines of a canoe. Link here:  Pocket net"
682310,misfish,2012-03-31 18:51:00,29133,"I want to know as well.Just what I have been looking for. I would sooner net a bow,then try and drag it up on shore.   Nice find Dave"
682351,Photoz,2012-03-31 21:13:00,792,"Nice heap of mesh to tangle your hooks in, don't you think?"
682353,misfish,2012-03-31 21:17:00,29133,Not at all Steve. Just wish there was  more info about it.
682394,Dave Bailey,2012-03-31 22:49:00,1641,"My main worry would be the hoop. A telescoping handle would not be a problem, lots of different implements have them and most work fine, but that hoop would have to expand as well in order to make the mouth of the net large enough for a fish. Thinking it might be a bit flimsy. Haven't seen one on shelves, so I have no idea how strong it might be. The picture on the web site only shows it in the compacted state."
682395,misfish,2012-03-31 22:57:00,29133,Sent a email  for more pics.
682478,alexmedic,2012-04-01 12:07:00,186," For a canoe, I'd think I'd prefer one of these:  Frabill  I also wonder if you could mod it to be a walking staff on the river....."
682481,skeeter,2012-04-01 12:20:00,1907,How about the frabill collapsible net for $22.36 I've had mine for over 20 years.  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp12/frabill_nets.pdf
682585,Djeep,2012-04-01 16:06:00,199,also another happy camper with the frabil collapsable. However I did feel it straining on a big steelhead once and thought it was on the edge of breaking. it was fully extended and the fish was heaaaavy.
682982,misfish,2012-04-02 19:42:00,29133,"Heard back from Lucky Strike.Looks like something I could use on the river. Going to check them out.   Any dealer can order the pocket net but the closest store that currently has some Pocket Nets in stock is SAIL in Vaghan.

683146,Dave Bailey,2012-04-03 03:24:00,1641," Thanks. I'm up in that area occasionally, I'll stop in next time."
689044,misfish,2012-04-21 19:10:00,29133,Well I stopped today at Sails to see this net.  WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP.
689209,RSF,2012-04-22 11:59:00,47,"Iv'e been using a fold-up net called 'The Masters Net' for more years than I can remember. When folded in it's sheath it measures about 6"" x 1"" x 2.5'; when open it's hole size is about 2 feet in diameter with a four foot shaft. I remember what I paid for it way back then though 80.00. Think it was InFishermen who were promoting it. Anyway, I have never had trouble with it, while others did, I'm not sure if they are made."
689238,Dave Bailey,2012-04-22 13:57:00,1641," Well, I guess that helps!"
