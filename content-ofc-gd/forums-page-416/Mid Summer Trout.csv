689161,wallacio,2012-04-22 02:19:00,475,"Bottom bouncers or 3 way rigs with spoons (my personal favourite is a small Williams Wobbler in the hammered gold finish),"
689164,northernpike56,2012-04-22 02:21:00,717,3 way rigs work good there..
689173,SirCranksalot,2012-04-22 02:38:00,3291,"Trout also tend to come into near  shallows and to feed near dusk. They also tend to gather at the mouth of streams, presumably because there's more oxygen  in the water as well as food being washed down."
689177,Broker,2012-04-22 03:00:00,482,Thanks for the info!
689210,Christopheraaron,2012-04-22 12:02:00,3525,"Plan your trip carefully, dusk creeps up fast there try to get a site close to the area you want to fish so that you dont have to do a big hike or paddle"
689251,Broker,2012-04-22 15:38:00,482,"Got one of the only sites available for what we needed , turns out its right on the water so it should be good!"
