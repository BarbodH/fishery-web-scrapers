689802,Rod Caster,2012-04-24 13:49:00,5784,"Here is what Air Canada gives you as a receipt when you purchase ""one extra baggage"" for $22.50.  They hand me this and I say ""you've got to be kidding me"" in a straight face she says "" we have to"", I say in response "" I highly doubt it"", she doesn't look pleased.  This has to be 15 feet long  "
689827,richyb,2012-04-24 15:50:00,774,You need the extra bag to carry that thing around with you .
689828,Roy,2012-04-24 15:53:00,13728,"Chad, when they don't look pleased you need to ask for the receipt in triplicate. Two photocopies will do thank you."
689831,Fisherman,2012-04-24 16:20:00,7201,"When everyone chooses the option to fly other than Air Canada and there's no income for them, maybe they will pay attention."
689832,kickingfrog,2012-04-24 16:23:00,8333,Half of the 22 bucks is for thermal recipt paper.
689840,Billy Bob,2012-04-24 16:51:00,5865,Southwest or AMERICAN AIR LINES is all I fly.....
689845,Rod Caster,2012-04-24 16:56:00,5784," Haha that's what I told the security guy.   I'd hate to see her scowl after that! haha   agreed, but aircan has the most flights per day so i can get to where i'm going on time, versus the other options.   haha, it took up to 4 minutes to print on the old school printer. zzzz. click click. zzzzz.click click.    How is their service from North Bay to Thunder Bay???"
689847,Billy Bob,2012-04-24 16:57:00,5865,Spotless.....never a delay....
689855,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-24 17:05:00,10439," I never fly AC. Never had a decent flight crew on any of times I did so I would rather stick a hot poker in my eye than fly with them.  Love Westjet, just wish there were more flight options. Their flight crews are a joy to fly with.    :good:"
689859,Christopheraaron,2012-04-24 17:29:00,3525,We always take AC or WJ but I definitely prefer West Jet.
689864,fishnsled,2012-04-24 17:48:00,3520,I didn't even know that they made that paper anymore. At least someone still has a good use for it.
689868,kickingfrog,2012-04-24 18:29:00,8333,Ya I have two ply.
