Just why the fishing was so great remains to be seen......perhaps the 2 fish limit meant more fish were released or that more and more are using artificials thus decreasing the need for roe. In any event, here is one of a few to ended the /09 steelie season. Fish put the bite on a robust 3 inch light pink un-scented worm. All the best in the New Year. Cheers. "
