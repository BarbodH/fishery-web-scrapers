Other than oil changes absolutely nothing else has been replaced in the last 2 years. Did some body work on it 3 years ago ,and honestly I can't remember the last mechanical repair I had to do on it.    Thank you Lew. That means a lot coming from you. You will love that truck."
416873,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-30 20:24:00,10439," Exactly, why would I buy a 1/2 ton pickup with a V8 when I tow my snowmobile or 18' aluminum. My Honda's 255 HP is plenty to pull them and I'm nowhere near the tow rating of the vehicle. I had an '89 full size Bronco that was a nice truck, except for all the issues with quality plus it only had 190 HP out of it's 5 liter V8. So I have 65 more HP and I get better gas milage to boot!!!"
416980,fishinfool,2009-12-31 01:02:00,366,"Well they told him today that Ford will have an answer for him tomorrow and if that doesn't work out in his favour he will do the arbitration thing. At this point, even if they agree to fix it they told him he won't get it back until around the 18th of Jan. If they aren't going to fix it and he goes to the next step, well who knows... He is looking right now for another truck to replace this one until it is resolved, if they fix the Ford then he will have to sell the one he buys now and swap ploughs. He has Ford financing and called them today and told them that until the issue is resolved he has stopped payments and taken the collision insurance off the truck. He left the fire and theft on it though. Prey for no snow, I feel for the guy he is losing a lot of sleep over this. Funny thing is, I used to laugh at him when he first started the business because he was using a GMC 1/2 ton and I was driving a Chevy Silverado HD Crew Cab. I kept razzing him to buy a real truck. Well he went out and bought this real nice Ford Super Duty and he was so proud!! The first time I saw it I said ""what the hell would you buy a fricken Ford for""? I think he wanted to kill me haha. Now I guess he understands what I was saying. I'll keep you all up to date when I hear the outcome. Thanks for all the comments and suggestions.  Stan"

I took a leap of faith and bought a truck made in Aliston, Ontario, a 2009 Honda Ridgeline and I have been blown away by it and the dealer service! It is a light duty truck but is perfect for hauling my sled & boat trailers and shuttles me downtown every day with reasonable gas mileage to boot. I looked at the big 3 and they wouldn't give me the deal I needed, so I went Honda. Only 35k so far, so it may be a bit early for a long term report but so far I am very happy with it (knock on wood!)."

416701,John Bacon,2009-12-30 04:13:00,3277," Yes, but I bet they honour their warranties.  The difference in customer service is much greater than the difference in quality between North American and Japanese companies."
416714,Bernie,2009-12-30 05:17:00,3190,"I work on them all, day in day out. About half of the vehicles I get in my shop are pickups, all breeds, mostly domestic. This is solely my opinion and I will try to remain impartial. Nothing is infallible. You can run into problems whatever you drive. Imports are generally more reliable but often are not designed to carry or pull like domestics (there are exceptions,I know) Parts were once quite a bit more for imports but that isn't so true anymore.  So my advise is buy what suits your requirements. You don't pull that boat every day (well most of us don't   ) You could make do with something a little less powerful in most cases and save fuel in the long run. Whatever brand you like, shop not only price but the dealer too.  They should have a good service department with technicians that know what they are doing. You may need to have good dealer relations in the future.  A diesel may sound cool to some but I believe the diesel designs in domestic pickups were meant to run day in day out to make them pay for themselves (as long as the turbo stays together). What you pay extra for the diesel and the higher maintainence costs you can buy a lot of gasoline. And the much heavier engine also takes a toll on front end suspension and steering components. So basically what I am saying is unless you really NEED a diesel why put up with the noise, stinking fuel and exhaust, sometimes hard to find good fuel and the issues I mentioned before?  Personally from what I see and if I needed to buy a new truck it would be a Ford with the 5.4. They do have their issues, yes, but they still on average are less problems than the others.  My personal pickup at this time is a 96 F-150 4x4 with 270,000 km on it and still runs great. Been the best truck for me ever, and believe me, I have driven many in the past.  I also have a Honda CRV that I have been running since last March. I also really like this one. Not great for a long trip but for booting around town it's a lot of fun and easy on fuel.  Take my words or leave em'....Just speaking my piece."

And just recently, the u-joint went and my local mechanic could not repair it due to some wierd type of C-Clip that Ford used on the 2004 models...he said it needed a special type of tool which he didn't have so I ended taking it back to the dealer and got hit with a $400 repair bill  ......now I'm trying to figure out what's happening with the huge vibration I'm getting on the front end....it starts around 50km and seems to get better around 110km..

Apparently the dealership is siding with him but Ford H/O engineering is suggesting foul play, saying that the truck ingested something external through the intake or filter area which took out the turbo. The funny thing is that the mechanic told him the secondary turbo blades or impeller are trashed but there is only a small nick in the primary or first blades or impeller. My question would be, how could anything have gotten by the first without destroying them? Whether it happened at the stealership or it was done by him is the question right now. I would have to agree with the few comments that suggested ""prove it"" or ante up and do the right thing!  He also told me that the plow has no relevance in his claim due to the truck being a Super Duty. I will let you know what happens when I hear."

As the blades start to go, it throws the balance of the turbo out. If the pieces make it into the engine the damage is un-believable and you can usually make out the turbo pieces in the engine only upon dissassembly. I would recommend your friend asks the dealer principle to ask the D.O.M (dealer operations manager ) for the district to come in to discuss the problem. If that does not go far then go to arbitration which involves both sides and a government abitrator.

About a month or so ago he went into the dealership complaining that the engine was very loud, they told him it was normal for that engine. He recorded the sound that the engine was making because he was pretty sure it was not right. About two weeks ago, lo and behold the motor started to make a lot of really not nice noises and he brought it in right away. They pulled the whole cab off the chassis and checked the engine. The final result is that the turbo blew apart and sent parts down into the engine which is now totally toast!!! The final say from Ford is that they will not honour the warranty because they are saying it was purposely done, can you believe that. This guy has trouble getting the hood open let alone finding a spot to put something into the turbo charger to do the engine in. I know that he wouldn't even realize that you could do that to a motor and he is not the type to do that in any case. This truck has 70,000 km on it and is barely broken in. He doesn't know what to do, he owns a plowing and landscaping business and just had the truck outfitted with a $10,000 Western plough which has yet to be used. Has anyone gone through this type of thing and what recourse does he have. Hope someone here has some insight into this problem."

Because he has been complaining about the noise, I am of the impression that they are assuming he has done it. Nothing to my knowledge has been found specifically pointing at him They removed the whole cab because that is how they re and re these engines. All this is just coming third hand from my buddy. He showed me pics on his phone of the cab hanging above the chassis, motor and drivetrain. The plough wiring and receiver components were installed a couple of months ago and the truck has yet to lift it. Western told him that the Ford Super Duty was the only truck they would recommend for this plough due to the truck being able to handle the extra weight.

Other than that the truck is great crazy power especially with the programmer. It jumped it from 360-460hp the thing is wild now it will smoke all six tires.. Anyways what i am getting at is did this guy add a programmer by any chance cause that would deff void the warranty hands down. You have to be carefull with them and always de program the truck before you take it in for service at your dealership. If he failed to do this the dealership and ford would be aware of it.

415913,fishinfool,2009-12-28 04:49:00,366," I can assure you that this truck has never had any chip or program mods done to it. The friend is not capable of turning on his computer and I know that he would never allow anyone to mess with his rig. I also have a friend who has done the mods to his Silverado 2500 and the truck definately flew after the fact. That is until he blew the motor out of it about three months later. It is similar to overclocking you computer, too much and you will fry the processer."
415927,danc,2009-12-28 05:47:00,4677," For 30 grand, absolutely he needs a lawyer. Unless he isn't telling you everything, I can't see how he can lose. It's up to Ford to prove that he self destructed the engine. He either did or he didn't. Let Ford tell the courts just how he blew it up."
415938,mbac31,2009-12-28 10:34:00,904,These engines are loud no matter what. I have the 8.1 ltr Turbo and it sounds like a bunch of little people are trying to beat their way out with hammers when its cold. Takes me from Toronto to Barrie before this dam tank warms up at all. Great motors. I would not be friendly to them at all for this. North american dealers are going the way of the dodo bird real soon. Customer service is at an all time low.
416037,POLLIWOGG,2009-12-28 17:35:00,835,"$30k for a motor with no warranty sounds like a down payment on a dodge to me. Put a towbar and a big lemon on the ford and use it for a trailer and take it everywhere. Buddy has a dodge that has had thousands of $ of warranty work done on it, just don't plan on keeping it after warranty.  This really doesn't pass the sniff test, Why would a dealer pass up 30k in warranty work, unless they plan to double bill for it.."
416041,BillM,2009-12-28 17:37:00,17367," Ding ding, we have a winner..  Tell Ford to prove the engine was intentionally damaged..  If they can't, youre buddy is fine..  No offense, but he's an idiot if he just lays down and takes this..."
416057,FUSION,2009-12-28 18:20:00,81,"[quote name='fishinfool' date='Dec 27 2009, 10:22 PM' post='415885 He doesn't know what to do, he owns a plowing and landscaping business and just had the truck outfitted with a $10,000 Western plough which has yet to be used.   If he put a plow on the front of his truck he is screwed. It voids all powertrain warrenty coverage. All Ford has to say in court is there was excess stress put on the engine due to him plowing and that is what caused the failure and thats as far as its going to go for your buddy. He will not be able to prove he hasen't plowed with it yet and thats what they will get him on when push comes to shove. I had a buddy with a similar situation with a 07 2500 Ram whem his tranny let go while plowing and Dodge would not honour there LIFETIME powertrain warrenty due to the fact he had a plow on the front of the truck.  Its a sad situation for your buddy but as soon as a dealer finds out its a ""work"" vehicle they want nothing to due with it and its not just Ford its everybody."
416073,vinnimon,2009-12-28 19:34:00,2593,"Correct if I am wrong.In the adverts on larger and more powerful trucks whether it is a ford or dodge or gmc.Do they not show them as being a work truck.If they are advertising them as being a workaholic vehicle and can take on some of the toughest jobs.Or are they just showing all of us that they can take a payload of some sort and splash a lot of mud,tow etc.My cherokee can splash like that plow and tow a boat etc.And mine is a 94 and still going.If they are adv that way then the dealer should not have an issue ,they are built to work,not grocery shopping.just my 2cnts worth."
416074,irishfield,2009-12-28 19:37:00,26272,"All depends on the model Vince. Ford is real specific in their warrantee booklets on F150/250... Straight cabs only.. no crew cabs, extended cabs etc. Straight cab with full box is the only recommended plow truck install and you also have to follow the other recommendations they have laid out. Not sure where the Super Duty fits in on their (Fords.. not Westerns) recommended plowing list.. Plowing is hard on a truck and why I use my old '98 GMC sierra to do mine."
416075,misfish,2009-12-28 19:53:00,29133," What snow????????LOL  There has to be more to the story here.It,s just to off.Plow or no plow."
416077,vinnimon,2009-12-28 20:01:00,2593,that I realize.It is hard on the vehicle itself.But geeze irish a blown turbo at 70000ks or so if im right.and never plowed with yet.They should of got it on the first complaint.Mind you I have seen a lot of you know hows going overboard with there trucks.For this unit in particular I do not know the specs.Is he in the right I dont know for sure.Should he play stupid yes and make notes.As I am always on the receiving end and trying to figure out what went wrong.I never get the full story.As a mentor always taught me there are three sides to a story.I try to read between the lines because I will never know the truth.Sorry irish just my 2 cnts worth.
416078,vinnimon,2009-12-28 20:07:00,2593,Geeze I wonder if there is a ford tech guy on board here and sitting still.  Not start an arguement just their opinion in the matter.
416082,irishfield,2009-12-28 20:18:00,26272,"Sorry Vince.. but all I stated is Ford is specific of which trucks can have plows and still be covered under warranteed.. and which cannot. Has nothing to do with the turbo blowing and they claiming he did it himself. Ford has to prove Fraud on his part.. and as I pointed out at first they MAY be trying to get out of honouring warrantee because he has a plow harness on the thing.  Love being called a ""know how"". Appreciate that you know.. that I know... how! lol"
416083,Terry,2009-12-28 20:23:00,14456,oh great Mr. know how what are the parts I need to buy to make a  trollmaster I mean the one for the boat not an internet  trollmaster..enough of them here already...LOL
