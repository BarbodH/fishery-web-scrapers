417586,MelJepp,2010-01-01 16:32:00,3,I started the art of fishing for the enjoyment and competition. I then turned it into a career path by going to school and getting several jobs as a fish hatchery technician. Not only do I get paid to fish but I get paid for doing something I enjoy.

416234,Twocoda,2009-12-29 01:51:00,4130,Well ever since they stopped making Windowpane LSD    i had to find another addiction...and fishing puts me in that equivalent  time zone  that NOTHING in this world matters

416318,limeyangler,2009-12-29 05:48:00,5204,I have no idea what compells me to fish. I can remember being fascinated by the water from a very early age. I have memories of fishing from when i was 2 years old. Nobody in my family fishes...at all...its something i was born with.

And, to be content it seems to want many fish and fishing experiences... and so I just agree to do what it asks of me."
416339,Rich Clemens,2009-12-29 11:59:00,3131,"For me, I spend far more time fishing in Canada each year than I do in my home state.  This year, 2009, I caught only one fish here in PA and I didn't even get it into the boat.  Primarily Patsy and I come north to enjoy the beautiful country and get away from everything.  Patsy likes to fish (when I'm catching fish) or just sit in the boat and read - she can do this for hours.     Whether we catch fish or not, it doesn't really matter.  We just love being out there and enjoy the company of friends - both old and new."

It's a never ending learning curve that draws me back day in and day out"
416358,wormdunker,2009-12-29 13:25:00,1711,"I like to get away from the everyday grind.  Even the  drive to  the lake is satisfying.  Sometimes I'll travel 8 hours for 3 or  4  days of fishing.    We'll  camp in a tent, or sleep  in  the van which is also a change.  Once the boat is launched then the challenge begins.  We  caught them here 2 weeks ago, where are they today ?    Then the first bite!!  Priceless."
416374,Fish Farmer,2009-12-29 14:14:00,2234,"I fish & hunt because of my dad, I blame him. Every day I fish & hunt, I think of him. Having a Great father brings back memories of all the time we spent together in the bush or boat. Only to have him back to do it all over.  ""Good thread uglyfish"""

416661,cowanjo,2009-12-30 02:31:00,249,I just watched the decade in review - this some how tells me why i get up at 5 am and go out in the dark or cold with mates or not and fish.  i race to the cottage every Friday night am normally alone trolling or casting. I caught one musky at almost 1;30 Am and I think I was more scared then i was  Why do i fish - because my dad taught me and he was passionate to sustain (thats why i take maybe a couple walleye a year) - he made be able to work out structure and where to fish. I am lucky that way and i think it is due to this tuition. I live in an opposite country now and dont see him so much but i will tell you he is an active member here!  Here is the link to why everyone should fish not fight - it has not been our finest decade http://www.smh.com.au/multimedia/world/the...91229-li3s.html  Great topic made me think of my family  John C

The fun of trying to outwit little fishies with brains the size of a pinkie nail. The little suckers beat me most of the time but every now and then I find 'em using my wits and a little help from my friends.  Keeping up with the technology is kinda neat too. Reading and trying, figuring out some new system I've heard about. Learning to use unfamiliar gear (baitcaster, flyrod, pin etc). Trying new lure presentations and retrieves.  It's all good, and the bonus is meeting good folks like y'all here on OFC.  JF"

416131,uglyfish,2009-12-28 21:56:00,981,"some great answers! thanks guys.  for me, its being outdoors. always somethin i loved, gettiun away from the noise of the city. the competition of tourney fishing. the fact that each time is different, gotta start all over each time u go out, changing conditions, making us change our strategies. seeing my kids faces when they catch a fish, the excitement they get. plus, im a gear junkie. i love the fact that each week somethin new is out to look at."
416134,blaque,2009-12-28 22:06:00,2419,"Mostly its the tap tap of the rod tip, or bounce bounce....kerplunk of the float.  But the anticipation is what its all about for me. Almost more fun than the actual landing of the fish. The ride to the launch with friends and family, the preperation of a trip, the meeting at timmies before hand.......tying up stuff the night before, its all like the night before christmas.  John started a thread about losing the christmas spirit. I mentioned how ive lost it a bit. I probably didnt lose it, .....it just got transferred to the night before fishing.  I have a big thing with NO SITE fishing as well.......something about seeing a fish im fishing for takes some of the fun away from it. I Love the process of throwing something out to the unknown and actually hooking up, when its a multi species situation.........i get that much more giddy about it. Wondering what it is until it flashes at the boat or my feet. ""Whatta ya think it is"" LOVE THAT!"

416146,shadowfly,2009-12-28 22:40:00,84,"For me, i guess it's the love for the water, the nature that surrounds it. and best part, appreciating it. if there is anything Id like to pass on to my kids and grand kids one day is the passion of fishing and appreciation of mother nature. at age 5 I remember my fishing rod being piece of branch about 5 foot long, fishing line, hook , washer for weight and cork for a float. and had a blast just being on the water rather than playing Atari. were all haunted by waters."

We would challenge each other at everything and loved sports.  I have never been physically fit, but I loved sports.  I played basketball, volleyball, I played hockey for 14 years, played baseball.  I love the competition.  For me, I love the challenge of fishing.  Every day is different.  I love the strategic aspect of the sport, how such miniscule details make such a difference in your success rate.  I love being able to share time in the outdoors with friends, or being able to fish alone in peace and tranquility (why I dont fish the Kawarthas much lol).  I love the sound of a topwater strike, I love the thump of a smallie hitting a spinnerbait, I love the tick of a fish picking up a senko, I love the hook set on a jig.  I love the drive to the ramp and the anticipation, I love the first cast, I just love everything about it."
