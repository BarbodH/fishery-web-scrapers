417290,Rob,2009-12-31 22:32:00,467,"Well, I concluded that this is the floatation suit that I would like to buy. I have called a couple of places that the Salus site recommends to get them at, and either they have only life jackets or they don't even know what I am talking about. Any help here would be appreciated guys!  BTW ""Happy New Years""  :D   Thanks, Rob C"
417304,Greencoachdog,2009-12-31 22:56:00,8163,You'd probably have better results if you did a google search for them and purchased one online... there's a lot more competition online and you can get some great deals if you'll shop around!
417418,jediangler,2010-01-01 02:53:00,1923,"Just keep calling all the retailers until you get one that has them in stock. These are made in Waterloo, Ontario I believe.  http://www.salusmarine.com/retailers/ontario.html"
417431,selcram,2010-01-01 03:30:00,26,"Hello!!  I purchased a Salus suit for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift!  The Rack and Reel (  formerly Simcoe bait and tackle ) in Barrie had them.   If they don't have any left, I'm pretty sure they can be ordered and only take a few days to come in!"
417473,Greencoachdog,2010-01-01 04:52:00,8163,"  If you should happen to ever need a new boyfriend, please PM me your phone #... I'd like to introduce myself!  Discophish, you better mind your manners and treat that woman right!!!"
417500,discophish,2010-01-01 06:03:00,392,"Hey wait a sec ... I didn't have a new Salus suit waiting for me under the tree on Christmas morning???  Mind my manners??  I should be keeping a closer eye on this girl, and find out who this ""boyfriend"" is!!  GCD, I better not see posts with you in a brand spankin' new Salus suit!!!  I'm on to you!  hahaha!  It's an awesome suit, all jokes aside.  Can't wait to to roll around on the ice with it."
417502,Greencoachdog,2010-01-01 06:17:00,8163,"  Hey Disco! H2whoa has my #  ... You'd better start thinking precious stone settings bubba!!!... if you don't, I will!!!   You should mark your territory you lucky bugger!!!"
417571,Rob,2010-01-01 15:46:00,467,"  Well I never even thought of looking there. I guess I will have to pay a visit. Thank you very much for the tip. I have Googled the name and not many retailers show up that sell the suit, but many for the lifejackets. Will keep you updated.  Rob C"
