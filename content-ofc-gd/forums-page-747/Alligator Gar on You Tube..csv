417124,TJQ,2009-12-31 14:23:00,7806,Nice one Dave!!
417131,wuchikubo,2009-12-31 14:35:00,1114,Very nice Dave!  Happy New Year to you and the family!
417150,Fishnwire,2009-12-31 15:06:00,983,"Dave, your technique is weak and your skills are lacking...  ...at the game of rock, paper, scissors.  I would destroy you!!!   Seriously though, nice fish.  I've got another reason to go visit my sister in Texas now."
417167,Abberz,2009-12-31 15:48:00,140,"Cool videos on youtube there Dave.  Just wanted to say I'm a really big fan of the show, never miss an episode!  The cast count and fish total are very innovative. Anyone who loves fishing knows everyday on the water isn't a guided trip where ""shore lunch"" is always included.  Keep up the good work and happy new year!"
