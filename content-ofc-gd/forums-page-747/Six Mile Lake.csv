417016,Paully,2009-12-31 02:16:00,712,Look for weedy bays that open up to deeper water.. you'll do just fine.
417042,irishfield,2009-12-31 02:51:00,26272,I know where the big perch hang out in the winter time..  
417123,NAW,2009-12-31 14:21:00,4022,I cought a perch about that size in the exact same spot last winter.  They get huge on the six eh..  As for pike.  Just look for weeds.
