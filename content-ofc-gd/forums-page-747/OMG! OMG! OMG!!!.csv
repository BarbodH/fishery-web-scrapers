417077,scuro2,2009-12-31 04:13:00,904, Shoulda paid the extra bucks for the tailored suit. This is what your outfit was supposed to look like. If your going to be a crimefighter you gotta look the part.

417172,Greencoachdog,2009-12-31 16:10:00,8163,  Yellow means caution and identifies safety hazards that will probably harm you if not approached in the right manner!
417188,Twocoda,2009-12-31 16:59:00,4130, and the green represents the envy you have for all the suits that are safety orange?
417287,Greencoachdog,2009-12-31 22:27:00,8163, The guys in the orange suits remind me of this:

This is the new Arctic Armor Plus suit by IDI  I can't believe how light weight it is compared to the conventional floatation suits, it's like 1/8th the weight or something, and is machine washable in cold water!  This suit will keep me warm dry and alive on the cold water!  Here's a link to their web site.  http://idigear.com/video-fox.php"
416939,kickingfrog,2009-12-30 23:45:00,8333,Now you just need the temp to drop to 60 degrees to use it.
