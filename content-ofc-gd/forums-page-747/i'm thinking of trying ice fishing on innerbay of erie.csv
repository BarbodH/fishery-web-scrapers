417136,skinny,2009-12-31 14:45:00,442,what is the best place to get ice conditions also how unreal is hut rental  I have a friend who use to fish many years ago said i could use his equipment I could go out from just about any area around the inner bay  I'm pretty close
417155,Sandbag,2009-12-31 15:19:00,533,There are a couple of hut operators in the St. Williams area who would be the best for ice conditions.  I know a couple of people have ventured out of Old Cut in the last few days.  Rotten Ronnies bait shop in long point would also have ice details if you give them a shout.  Cheers  Craig
