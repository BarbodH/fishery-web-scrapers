416734,wormdunker,2009-12-30 13:04:00,1711,"Very good info above but I found the 1 lb bottles on the Mr. Buddy do not last more than 4 hours.  I bought a 6' propane hose from CTC (without a regulator) to adapt to the 20 lb bottle.  I used this set up in the operators cab of a crane.  The 20 lb bottle lasted 10 days, 8 - 10 hours per day on the low setting."
416735,canadadude,2009-12-30 13:10:00,769,Now thats a great idea
416738,Terry,2009-12-30 13:20:00,14456," that's why they pay me the big bucks..........LOL  most times they are only ¾ full and it will take 2 tanks instead of 1½ to say out 8 or so hours, but it stll takes up a lot less room then a 20lb tank IMHO"
416739,motion,2009-12-30 13:20:00,403," Wayne, you can overfill them without a pump. The instructions on filling call for you to ""freeze"" the empties. I use a cheap digital food scale (from Walmart) to weigh bottles while filling. I fill them to 29.5 oz (total gross weight)."
416915,walleyejack,2009-12-30 22:34:00,358,"Is there a reason the green tanks have to be in the freezer overnight ? Can i not just hook up the hose and crank er open if they only fill  3/4  full anyway ? or should i be weighing them, do they need to be completley empty, or can i top er up"
416948,GBW,2009-12-31 00:03:00,8460,Terry?  LOL
416951,Terry,2009-12-31 00:07:00,14456,"yes you can just fill them where is as is and right now the outside is colder then your freezer, so.........   and if you bring your 29lber inside to warm up you will get even more into the small one, but I don't  but just hook'em up and fill them"
416953,GBW,2009-12-31 00:09:00,8460,Thank you
416954,Jonny,2009-12-31 00:11:00,1380,"I went to Superior Propane in North Bay a few days ago (before this thread) and asked if they sell 5 lb tanks. They said no, not much demand, but they could order one.  I said, how much?  They said, $79 !!!"
416956,GBW,2009-12-31 00:13:00,8460,WHAAAAAAT?!?!?!  If you are ever in Whitby/Brooklin area let me know and I'll give ya a 1lb one if you need.
416958,Jonny,2009-12-31 00:14:00,1380,"Thanks for the offer, GBW!  EDIT - Oops! I thought you meant a 5 pounder. I've got a few 1 pounders. Just need one of them gizmos to fill em."
416960,GBW,2009-12-31 00:16:00,8460,not to worry.  I have 6 right now and may end up with a few more while I wait for the maccoupler.
416376,GBW,2009-12-29 14:22:00,8460,"Hey all.  I was wondering if anyone knows where I can get a Mr. Heater Propane Tank Adapter to fill my 1LB tanks from my 20LB tank.  I called BPS and was told that they do not sell it, yet it's on the web site...      so if anyone can let me know where to pick 2 up in the GTA that would be great, thanks.  Geoff"
416380,Terry,2009-12-29 14:36:00,14456,they are also called  EZ Propane Filler Coupler MacCoupler  this place in the Innisfil area had a few of them 5 days ago you could give them a call  LOVE TO FISH SIMCOE Bait & Tackle - Belle Ewart 705-456-8745
416385,motion,2009-12-29 14:51:00,403,"Got mine on Ebay last year. They work great. I will suggest that you buy a digital food scale (Walmart) to avoid overfilling the tanks.. The empties weigh 13.5 oz and you add the 16 oz of fuel for a total of 29.5 oz. Make sure you freeze the empties before filling them.  Here is the link to the one I bought on Ebay.  http://cgi.ebay.ca/Brass-Propane-Bottle-Re...=item2c4fe417ce  If you can get it locally as Terry has said, get it. I was under the impression that they are not legal to sell up here. Thats why I ended up buying it on Ebay.  Cheers."
416387,Terry,2009-12-29 14:54:00,14456,they are legal up here but once you refill them they are illegal to transport  so if you get in an accident on the way to your icefishing you could be in trouble
416394,motion,2009-12-29 15:01:00,403," Ya, but they gotta prove I just filled them. Thats why I leave the adapter locked up at home. LOL"
416395,Terry,2009-12-29 15:07:00,14456,"and that is why I have been doing it for over 30 years  it is real simple to make one too  you take an old propane torch and unscrew the flame end  find an old BBQ and cut the black hose off that has the end that attaches to the 20lb tank now shove the tube that the flame end was attached to on the old torch, into the hose and put a clamp on it  one fully functional refiller  with a cut off valve on it too"
416398,motion,2009-12-29 15:11:00,403,And it sure beats carrying around a larger tank and hose (to trip over)
416406,GBW,2009-12-29 15:23:00,8460,Thanks guys.  I'll give them a shout!
416412,GBW,2009-12-29 15:31:00,8460,D'OH!  you guys are quick as they are all spoken for...  more to come in a week or so...
416413,motion,2009-12-29 15:32:00,403,Well worth the wait. It'll be longer than that on Ebay.
416414,Terry,2009-12-29 15:37:00,14456,guess I should have pmed you  they ship them here quick  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...rset=ISO-8859-1
416416,Guest skeeter99,2009-12-29 15:38:00,0,  cabelas carries them
416417,GBW,2009-12-29 15:38:00,8460,It's all good Terry.  I can wait (not to long though)...
416419,irishfield,2009-12-29 15:41:00,26272,Motion... stop posting Ebay links... click.. click..password..click.. now I'm short a case of beer !
416456,motion,2009-12-29 18:20:00,403, Then stop clicking Wayne! LOL
416465,steve barrett,2009-12-29 18:31:00,142,
416469,GBW,2009-12-29 18:41:00,8460,care to share how you made it?
416472,irishfield,2009-12-29 18:52:00,26272,Terry described it above GBW .. you just need an old propane torch head and an old BBQ regulator hose. Don't have them.. click the ebay link! lol
416476,GBW,2009-12-29 18:59:00,8460,D'OH!  Didn't see that part I was going to click the link but I'll order from the folks Terry told me about.
416477,steve barrett,2009-12-29 19:01:00,142,Not mutch more than that . Just a bit of silicone for a bit of a seal and a couple of small clamps and it is a done deal. Steve
416480,GBW,2009-12-29 19:13:00,8460,"I sure hope my neighbour's don't see me when I'm out back ""fixing"" his BBQ..."
416689,mjack 7,2009-12-30 03:47:00,22,Fishing World in Hamilton has the mr. heater couplers.  I've used the mac couple and I found it's hard to get a good fill out of it reguardless how cold you get the cylinder. Maybe the mr. heater one is better.
416694,Jonny,2009-12-30 04:04:00,1380,"This sounds great!  Tell me, how do you avoid over-filling? Or is it simply a matter of pressure equalization?"
416702,irishfield,2009-12-30 04:13:00,26272,That's all it is Jocko... you'd need a pump to over fill and why mjack is claiming hard to get a good fill. You'll never it get it as full as it came from the store.
416715,Jonny,2009-12-30 05:36:00,1380,"Thanks, Irish!  The reason I asked was an earlier post where a kitchen scale was mentioned. I figured it might not be necessary as long as a 1 lb tank can withstand the same pressures as a 20 lb tank. Of course the kitchen scale could give you a good idea of just what percentage of fill you can get."
