A couple cranks on the manual auger found about 4-5 inches of good clear ice over 19 feet of water.  The ice was constantly groaning and making all sorts of bubbly star wars sounds, never heard it like that before.  A simple minnow hook and sinker was sent down and rewarded 12 foot with the first perch, I wasn't far behind, groping around in the dark for a minnow, set up the my F/F which immediately showed fish.  The bite was pretty consistant, a mix of keepers and small ones that went back down the hole, just about any type of bait worked.  By about 930 we had enough for a tasty feed, packed up and were homeward bound.  If all goes well we'll try again tomorrow.   "
