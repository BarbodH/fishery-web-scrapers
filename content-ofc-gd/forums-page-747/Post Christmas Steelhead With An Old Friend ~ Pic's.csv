416776,solopaddler,2009-12-30 15:34:00,8605,"With Dave (Drifter016) visiting from Yellowknife we were looking to beat the post Christmas blahs with some chrome. Long before he moved to the arctic we spent many a day together fishing for great lakes steelhead. It was a nice Christmas present to get reaquainted again and hit the road like we did in the old days. Joining us was BillM, his enthusiasm always welcome. Although the temperatures were quite mild (at least milder than the norm) it was a brief 2 hour period in the afternoon when the sun came out that turned the fish on. I enjoyed a nice little session down near the lake that saw me put a good dozen or so on the bank. Not bad at all for this time of year. Most all were caught on fresh skein, some kind of scruffy but many were very clean and surprisingly strong. All in all it was a great day. Very few other anglers were on the river, and enough fish came to hand to make it memorable.                   Funny thing, apparantly my rod has some serious mojo attached to it. Both Dave and Bill borrowed the magic stick and instantly caught fish. Billy actually caught 2 LOL!  First Dave (Notice how he not only stole my rod and my fish but also my pose?  )        These pic's of Billy were long distance shots as he hooked the 2 fish right at the 11th hour as we made our way back to the car. (That rod is powerful!  )       Great day boys, looking forward to more of the same tomorrow."
416784,walleye_man,2009-12-30 16:06:00,135,hey guys great report and beautifull fish congrats
416804,strakey,2009-12-30 16:52:00,78,"Nice Mike,  that area is always a good bet for steelies. Wish i could ov been there as well. We were freezing our buts off fishing ontario east after the rain and gettin nothing."
416808,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 17:00:00,0,"looks like a nice day.  the ice chunk regatta has kept me from venturing out.  i haven't put my float stuff into storage, but with the onset of hardwater season, i have a feeling she'll be going away until march real soon.  cool report as always."
416809,blaque,2009-12-30 17:02:00,2419,"Looks like a light day for you boys lol  Drifter must have thought of it as ""Balmy"" compared to out west with his jacket wide open and all lol"
416836,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-30 18:46:00,10439,"  Yep, she was a nice warm day. I spent the whole morning with only 2 tee shirts and my wading jacket. It cooled down a touch in the afternoon so I had to don the sweatshirt."
416853,BillM,2009-12-30 19:18:00,17367,"Yup, that rod definitely has some mojo...  I think I need to upgrade to a CTS, such a sweet stick.  I wonder how happy those guys were when I plucked two fish out from under their noses in about 5 mins?  lol"
416857,solopaddler,2009-12-30 19:24:00,8605, They were probably awestruck by your gloriousness.
416861,BillM,2009-12-30 19:36:00,17367,  About my only shining moment the entire day
416871,blaque,2009-12-30 20:22:00,2419," Easy now, those words can delete that stick mojo right quick"
416874,BillM,2009-12-30 20:24:00,17367,  I don't think I'll be using Mike's setup anytime in the near future
416887,canadian_copper,2009-12-30 21:11:00,925,awesome as usual mike. nice to see dave down again too.
416898,blaque,2009-12-30 21:43:00,2419, Not after plucking two fish on the way back to the car with it as he takes pics lol
416901,douG,2009-12-30 22:02:00,2693,"Sweet, Mike.  Congratulations to the whole dang crew.  I hope I get to fish with BillM and Drifter#16 sumday, I'm sure there is a whole lifetime of experience and info I could mebbe learn. Pic #4 is a stunner."
416905,solopaddler,2009-12-30 22:06:00,8605, How about tomorrow?
416968,ironstone74,2009-12-31 00:33:00,201,Nice fish boys!  Beats the skunks at the Whirlpool.  Paul
416971,kickingfrog,2009-12-31 00:45:00,8333,Sooooo? Are you saying Drifter016 is old? Or BillM ???????   Fish fish!
417003,BillM,2009-12-31 01:51:00,17367," Mike was in double digits (as usual) for the day, those were my only fish.  I was running a wee bit short the entire day, had two on, a few headshakes and they were gone.  Was nice to end the day like that though... And that CTS/RiverKeeper setup?  Oh boy... talk about light.   My GL3/AngSpec combo in comparison weighs a tonne.   I think I see a CTS in my near future..."
417107,corvette1,2009-12-31 12:57:00,1765,awesome day guys congrats
417143,Moosebunk,2009-12-31 14:53:00,3970,Nice to see Drifter found a patch of open water.  Can't imagine Yellowknife has too many soft water options this time of year... especially ones for steelhead.  Good outing fellas.
417344,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-01 00:22:00,10439,"  Yeah, my home water is a little thick right now. At least until late May!!! But it's easier to drill through when it's like that."
417346,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-01 00:24:00,10439,"  Thanks Scott, it was nice to chase some GL Chrome again."
