416822,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 17:57:00,0,father in law just got the cabelas remote controlled cam.  i dig it.
417088,Stoty,2009-12-31 06:13:00,2910,"Naw, decided against it afterall. I appreciate all the input though!"
417091,Twocoda,2009-12-31 06:28:00,4130,Stoty ...how did you make out in the wild west? Did you fish any of the spots i suggested?
417223,johndox,2009-12-31 19:16:00,54,When we ice fish we use both a flasher plus an underwater camera. I think it is an Aqua Vue and it is a great learning tool to watch fish bite your bait and what they do. But if you know how to read your flasher properly it really a better tool for catching fish.
405399,Stoty,2009-11-25 15:03:00,2910,"I'm thinking about getting an underwater camera for the upcoming ice fishing season, and just wanted to know which one you would recommend?  Aqua Cam, Aqua-Vu and Fish TV are the ones that I've heard of. Are there any others? What should I be looking for?  Any help is much appreciated.    *Stoty"
405400,johnnyb,2009-11-25 15:07:00,3413,"I like my Aqua-Vu...but I'm just wondering...do you already have a flasher/sonar device?  I only ask because I bought the camera first, and regret it...wish I had've bought the sonar first....it shows you what's going on from top to bottom, not just one limited window of view. Just my $0.02  If you're getting a camera, go Aqua-Vu"
405403,Stoty,2009-11-25 15:12:00,2910,I have a portable sonar unit already.
405411,fishermccann,2009-11-25 15:36:00,655,I have a Aqua-view Quad-360   Four cameras to show all directions. I love it for ice fishing on Simcoe as it has enough lights to see down 70 feet in the dark.
405412,Uncle Buck,2009-11-25 15:37:00,1000,"I got 1 last year...  i got the cabelas one...  great deal on the panning camera on the US site... $130 i believe...  Would i get one again... NO  to much of a hassle, big/heavy need to properly orient it, cable is always in the way... cable/camera shows up on flasher...  again, if i had to do it over, i wouldn't buy one..."
405413,johnnyb,2009-11-25 15:38:00,3413,"There ya go...then you know my answer   My A-V has been very reliable...they seem to have the most up-to-date product line, and customer service is excellent."
405417,TDunn,2009-11-25 16:09:00,680,What Johnny said!!! Customer service is amazing. I shipped my view off for repairs and had it back in under 2 weeks fixed and shipped for free.....If you get a UW cam you cant go wrong with an aqua view. Oh and purchase the tripod....its worth the extra $20....   TDunn  Edit: It was my fault the cam broke by the way. I will never take it through rough terrain in a sleigh behind a snowmachine ever again! Buy or find something to use as a case. i use a shimano soft tackle bag I had no use for anymore.
405420,Dara,2009-11-25 16:18:00,3052,"I have seen them usefull for whitefish, but other than that, is a camera really that usefull. I can see the flasher being good, but a camera just doesn't have the range in my point of view. Can anybody educate me?"
405422,TDunn,2009-11-25 16:36:00,680,"Dara,  For our area I find it very useful for mainly whitefish, steelhead and perch. I have used it for other species but not very often. I do bring it when fishing other species to help locate structure tho. What I began doing last year is setting up the cam on my set line outside the shack. With this set up I can constantly watch my set line outside from the inside of the shack while using a flasher inside. It is pretty wild using the cam for whities at the pier, leighs bay or up north for whities/perch/steelhead.    TDunn"

405425,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-25 16:40:00,0,"i can't help but feel that some fish would speak by lowering a device such as this in the water... here some of us gear down our line diameter because we don't want fish to see them, while others are lowering cameras down?  between the visual distraction and scents possibly carried on your unit, i'll take my chances with just the flasher.  they are neat though."
405426,TDunn,2009-11-25 16:45:00,680,I agree I know they do spook fish....sometimes..... But I am also sure the noise of a flasher does too.... It great when the fish dont mind they are on TV tho!  TDunn  Edit: kinda getting off topic here....Stoty my vote is for a Aqua view...Hope you are happy with whichever you get
405427,GBW,2009-11-25 16:48:00,8460,getting the Christmas wish list ready?  I've asked for the Fish TV unit
405431,Dara,2009-11-25 17:08:00,3052,  I did fish for whitefish with one last year. Made it almost too easy. I guess it could help locate perch as a friend of mine said he found that he was fishing in weeds and had tp move away from them to get fish. For lakers and such I guess not

405445,perchslayer666,2009-11-25 17:49:00,280,"I have had an Aqua View Scout SRT going onto it's 4 season (after one replacement thanks to Bass Pro - The ON/OFF button got stuck...) And let me tell you, it is AWESOME!!! It's great for fishing in shallower water bodies (unless the water is very clear ie. Simco) to see what is going on underneath the ice, and ultimately watching fish behavior. I have never noticed the cord drawing attention, as i would see schools of fish swim around the camera with out being spooked. For deeper water where the visibility isn't so good, i'll use my Lowrance Ice Machine  The Aqua View is a great investment, you'll have a ton of fun with it and you'll be amazed seeing fish coming out of no where to smack your lure. Make sure you by the tripod!  Oh, yea if I have the cash I would pick up the Color Marcum camera….check that one out too!"
405456,Greencoachdog,2009-11-25 18:28:00,8163,"Underwater cameras are great for ice fishing because the water clears due to no wind or rain mudding up the water after the ice forms, they also very good in very clear lakes... but!... for lakes that don't freeze over and aren't clear they're of little use. I bought one and have only used it a couple of times because the visibility on the lake I fish is never more than a foot or so and I can't see diddly!"
405482,Stoty,2009-11-25 20:10:00,2910,"Thanks for the replies so far! The cameras themselves are shaped like fish, not sure if those of you who said it might spook them knew that or not."
405487,fishermccann,2009-11-25 20:35:00,655,"They do not spook fish. We have had many Whitefish ,Lakers, Perch come right up to the camera with the lights on and nibble on the camera. It is a good joke among us when someone gets the "" fin ' , a fish comes up to the camera and puts its fin on the lens. I have a Quad360 so all four guys in the fish-hut get their own lens and get to watch their own spreader."
405494,Paully,2009-11-25 20:51:00,712,  There's not much to see Glen.... Im sure dams look simular below water as above
405501,Stoty,2009-11-25 21:13:00,2910,"HAHAHA, nice one!"
405503,dave524,2009-11-25 21:15:00,4508,Is it not illegal to use an artificial light to attract fish? The cameras with lights could be seen as attracting fish if you have a baited line down as well. Maybe something for those with these units to research.
405504,Terry,2009-11-25 21:21:00,14456,"they have minimum light....they are not illegal if you put more lights on the camera, then maybe a problem"
416754,GBW,2009-12-30 13:57:00,8460,"So Stoty, ya get one? I got the Fish TV unit this year. for those looking to get a battery to power the unit rather then 10 ""C"" batteries I found a place called Sayal Electronics.  You can get a 12V 7AMP for $25. there rather then $40+ at CTC."
