Tournament anglers sometimes prefish and then can't get to their fish.  Ice fishing is really no different.  Safety is always the first priority but we don't just fish a spot out of convenience either.  We set out this morning on good safe ice with fish in the area and although the action wasn't fast and furious, we did catch a decent number of fish.  The biggest fish of the day was 11lbs.  Here are a few photos of some of today's fish.  Jeff          "
