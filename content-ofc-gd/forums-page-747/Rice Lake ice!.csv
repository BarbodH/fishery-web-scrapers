Remember boys and girls, don't be part of the statistics...play safe and only go where you know.  This was from out front of Gores Landing. Even when we were kids you had to be careful playing hockey and such around the marinas as they run bubblier systems to protect their docks from getting damage from the ice.   "
416975,Michael_Brown,2009-12-31 00:56:00,411,How did you drill the holes? I thought you were on the DL.  I would have paid good money to see you running in circles around the hole trying to drill with one hand.  Thanks for the update.

417095,Garnet,2009-12-31 11:08:00,2056,"The 1 area of Rice that will always be dangerous is mouth of the Otonabe  over to Spook Is. then threw the gap at Tick Is. touching Curtis, Shearer, Rack Is. Grasshopper, Margret and to the river to Hastings.  If you take the first road off County rd 10 that goes to Harris Boat Works on a warmer day you will see how the current touches all these Pts. it just looks like a river.  Just be careful  Garnet"
