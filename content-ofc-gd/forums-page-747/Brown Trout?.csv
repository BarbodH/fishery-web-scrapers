Has anyone been catching Browns?  It is my understanding that Brown Trout typically run upstream in the fall after the Salmon are gone and around the same time the Steelhead are in.  Based on the recent pics it looks like the Steelhead are still around.  Are the Brown Trout still around?  Just trying to understand the cycle/pattern of Fall/Winter tributary fishing.  Thanks."
