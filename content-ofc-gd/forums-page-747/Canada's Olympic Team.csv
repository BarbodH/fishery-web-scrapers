417252,JohnF,2009-12-31 20:47:00,3494, Some of the hockey talking heads discussed that and made a good point. Does the team want goal scorers for defencemen or defencemen who can score goals. Green may not measure up in the defence department.  I was a little surprised at Fleury ahead of Luongo but the guys picking the team have done their due diligence.  JF
417253,JohnF,2009-12-31 20:50:00,3494, As much as I dislike Pronger he has some pretty solid credentials as an international player. I just hope he can resist the temptation to do something dirty and give our country's team a black eye.  JF

The IOC requires them to announce the roster, I'm sure they would rather wait until closer to the games since there is no time to practise anyway."
417508,ADB,2010-01-01 07:15:00,444," Many would argue that the team in 2006 was not nearly as good as the current team, but that's all subjective debate anyways.  Canada won gold in 2002.  The last time Russia won gold? 1988 in Calgary (as the Soviet Union) when it was amateurs playing.  In the end, Canada is the favourite to win gold, and I'll take a bet from anyone who wants to disagree.  Heck, I just bought the new Stradic CI4 on Boxing Day...I'd be willing to put that up if anyone wants to bet against our boys"
417515,lunkerbasshunter,2010-01-01 11:57:00,2585,"im shocked lecavier wasnt taken.  I would of had stamkos on the team as well!  I guess overall it doesnt really matter, the whole tourny comes down to the best goaltending.  If marty plays well we will go a long way.  Cheers!"
417545,kickingfrog,2010-01-01 14:47:00,8333, In '92 the Gold was won by the team representing what was left of the crumbling USSR. Technically Russia has never won Olympic gold in mens hockey.

416833,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 18:40:00,0,i believe mike fisher should have been on this squad. he's carried an injured and underperforming sens squad on his back... and they still have a respectable record.  his personal stats and team stats were better than mike richards.  i'm glad regehr and phaneuf were left off although i would have liked to have seen j-bo in there.
416837,jediangler,2009-12-30 18:49:00,1923,"Looks pretty good to me, young for the most part, and has players who have won at every level. You could pick two more Canadian teams and probably 2 out of the 3 would end up in the medals. Tough job for Yzerman to pick this team but I think he did well."

416879,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 20:34:00,0,"we aren't playing on the large ice surface, we're in canada!  i think mike green missed out because he's an offensive player similar to boyle.  and doughty was brought on for PP. we have to have some solid stay at home guys too! nieds is there as a leader.  nice to know our nation is so deep, not that its any surprise!"
416880,uglyfish,2009-12-30 20:42:00,981,"doughty is one of the stroger defensive d men they have on that squad. he has offensive talent as well, but hes a steller d man. no matter where u look, there is another guy that could have filled a position on that team. dion phaneuf should be there. not having the best season either, but when u want a guy that can play in his own end and deliever big hits, hes the guy for the job."
416886,ADB,2009-12-30 21:07:00,444," Being in Canada has nothing to do with it.  This is the first time ever that Olympic hockey has been played on ""NHL-sized"" ice, regardless of being in Canada, or North America for that matter.  The sole reason?  Not geography, but economics - it would cost too much money to improve the GM place, and they can seat more fans (and sell more tickets) with the smaller surface."
416894,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 21:29:00,0," so, because we use smaller ice surfaces in North America/Canada, this has nothing to do with geography? easy pierre mcguire, i was just puffing out my national pride!"

Bergeron, Morrow, Staal, Towes, Seabrook......  Are you kidding me?????  I agree with Doughty on the team, because he is about as solid as they come on the blueline defensively speaking. But wow...no Green. I guess being the defending scoring leader of defensemen in the NHL doesnt matter.  Bergeron over St. Louis/Carter.... WOW Staal over Lecavalier/Carter.... WOW Towes over Stamkos/Lecavalier... WOW (just because he scored a couple dandy shootout goals in the world juniors, doesnt mean he deserves to be on the team over those guys)  Seabrook is a fantastic defenseman, but him over Green/Phaneuf is just stupid.  With that lineup.....I don't know if I can see them taking out the Russians. They have an amazingly stacked lineup.  Overall...VERY disappointed in the selections."
416927,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 23:23:00,0,"  I would argue that this team is built to play against the russians.  your team sounds like an allstar team, not a well constructed and cohesive hockey team."
416930,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-30 23:28:00,0,(it also sounds a lot like the 7th place team in 2006)
416946,kickingfrog,2009-12-31 00:01:00,8333,"It's hockey in Canada, if the team wins gold, all is good. If the team doesn't get gold, they are bums.  '98: Gretzky sits during shoot-out, team loses= wrong decision.  '02: Mario is too old, team wins= right decision.  '06: Sid stays home, team loses= wrong decision   It is a TEAM, you can't just take the 23 best players."
416986,ADB,2009-12-31 01:16:00,444," It actually doesn't considering they've used international sized rinks, without exception, for every Olympic games held in North American cities, until now.  I'm just pointing out the facts - nothing wrong with some Canadian pride  If there's any team I'd be concerned about it's the USA.  The Russians and Swedes pick teams based more on politics and domestic loyalties than on skill, hence the reason why each of their teams contain numerous non-NHL players, while unquestionably better NHL players will be sitting at home.  The USA, on the other hand, are young, full of talent, and will be icing the hottest goalie in the NHL right now - Ryan Miller.  Their only question mark is their defense, which is suspect compared to Canada's.  Canada is still the odds-on favourte, and anyone who disputes that is just grasping at straws."

416994,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-31 01:32:00,0," the russians are full of snipers.  it's not politics i'm worried about...it's names like ovechkin, malkin, kovalchuk, datsyk, semin, markov and gonchar.  there's nothing ""political"" about that type of firepower."

417190,ADB,2009-12-31 17:03:00,444," No one can argue with that list, except I wouldn't exactly call Markov and Gonchar ""snipers.""  They're just great offensive defensemen who are liabilities in their own zone.  Even Datsyuk has never scored more than 32 goals in a season, while most of the Canadian forwards have.  As great as that team is, they still have guys on there like: Konstantin Korneyev, Ilya Nikulin, Danis Zaripov, and Sergei Zinoviev.  That's nearly 20% of their team that aren't good enough to play in the NHL.  Not to mention the marginal NHLers/former NHLers on the team like: Fedor Tyutin, Dmitri Kalinin, Viktor Kozlov, and Alexei Morozov.  And it's not like Canada doesn't have snipers...Iginla has won the Rocket Richard twice, Rick Nash has won it once, and Dany Heatley has multiple 50+ goal seasons under his belt.  Russia is a good team, probably an excellent goal-scoring team, with above-average goaltending.  But Canada is a complete team, with players who have won at every level.  If Canada picked a 2nd team, all of those players who still be better than a portion of the current Russian team."
417202,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-31 17:31:00,0,that's mighty cocky to say considering where we finished last olympics.  on paper our team then was just as good.
