417201,Burtess,2009-12-31 17:29:00,901,Total morons..... do they not know how dangerous that initial pop through the ice and go underwater is...  what if he didn't find the hole????  Burt
417211,yakpiker,2009-12-31 18:32:00,160,I agree with Burtess...I thought the kid would gasp when he went through the ice...very lucky that he didn't take water into his lungs...probably wouldn't have seen the video then.
