From Monday until Thursday, U.S. Coast Guard cutter Mobile Bay will clear a path for various vessels into Georgian Bay.  Anglers, snowmobilers and other recreational enthusiasts who frequent the harbour are being ""strongly advised"" to remain clear of the icebreaker's tracks, because it will cause hazardous and unstable ice conditions."
