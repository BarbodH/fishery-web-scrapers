417065,Greencoachdog,2009-12-31 03:46:00,8163,"... btw, I thought float fishin' was a gurley-guy sport?  I heard that real Canadians punch holes through 3' of ice with a hand auger while wearing a t-shirt and drinking copious amounts of Molsons and taking a big whiz down each hole to show the fish who's boss...   ...or maybe that's what real Ukrainians do?... what the heck!... Ukrainians...Canadians... they're both the same!!!  They both eat too many cabbage rolls and pierogies!!!"
417069,pike slayer,2009-12-31 03:54:00,1177,sounds about right but scratch cabbage rolls for poutine
