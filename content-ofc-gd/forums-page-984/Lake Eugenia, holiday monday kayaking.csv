236162,jediangler,2008-08-04 22:01:00,1923," It was hot and windless on lake Eugenia between 10am and 2pm today. Tried dropshotting for the first time after reading about it on the board. Caught this 14""er on a power jerk shad on a 4/0 hook 16"" above a 1/4oz weedless jig & grub on a baitcasting set up. I don't like this style of fishing out of a kayak. I'm sure it's great from the nose of a bass boat. Picked up a couple little smallmouth as well as a rockbass and some dink perch on a 1/8oz jig & grub on the spinning rod before heading back to the car. The boat launch was a zoo at 2pm. Half a dozen waiting to put in and another half dozen waiting to come out. Only one little ramp for everybody. I just pulled up between sandcastles on the beach and dragged the yak to my car."

236237,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-05 00:37:00,2585,good report!  good on you for trying something new today.  Cheers!
236259,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-05 01:17:00,0,Nice bass. I too have been experimenting with drop shooting. A lot of success but nothing over a pound yet for me.
236415,jediangler,2008-08-05 12:25:00,1923,"No batttle from that guy Leechman, maybe if I was using the ultra-lite. With the baitcaster I just winched it in. The little smallies gave a better fight on the spinning rod. I'd take a 16"" smallie over a 20"" largie for the fight."

236644,Reef Runner,2008-08-05 19:38:00,980,Love them yak reports Jedi.  I agree that smallies have more fight in 'em then largies.  Could it be mouth envy? lol
236813,joonmoon,2008-08-06 02:19:00,528,"Good one Bro. Did ya git em in your new fav weedbed? I like the deepweed line with the rocky shore off the big island. Goog and i tried a new spot for eyes on the Grand but Nadda, still lookin for em."
236818,Leecher,2008-08-06 02:40:00,7832, OK so you were using a baitcaster for that bucket mouth.... Cool  And I too would choose a smallie over a largie anytime.... they do put up a good fight. LM
