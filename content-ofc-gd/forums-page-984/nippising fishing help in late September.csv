236546,michigander,2008-08-05 16:46:00,5,I will staying at Lakair the last week in September for just a few days and I would appreciate suggestions on fishing. I have been there before but earlier in the summer. All I want is a few eating size walleye and then fun with pike and maybe a musky. Do the locations of the walleye change this time of year? Deeper? What is the best way (tackle) I read the long topic on bottom bouncing... sounds good Anyadvice on all the above species is greatly appreciated Thanks

236686,Mike01,2008-08-05 21:38:00,378,"As the year goes on the fish tend to go deeper.  Look for breaks in 20'-30', sometimes even deeper.  With the crazy weather we have had this summer, its hard to say what they will be doing until the fall is actually here.  Hope that helps a bit."
236796,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-06 01:39:00,2585,i have said this before.  go to a local bait shop and spend like 20 or 30 bucks and while your paying ask what is happening out there.  you will be surprised how much info the locals will give you if you are dropping coin in there businesses.  My guess is they will be feeding heavy as fall is under way especially up there and fishing should be great!  Cheers!
