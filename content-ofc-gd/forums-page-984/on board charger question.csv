236452,cranks bait,2008-08-05 13:33:00,721,If I run a 24 volt bow mount motor do I use a one or two bank charger to charge the 24 system?

236459,cranks bait,2008-08-05 13:41:00,721,I'm guessing I have to disconnect the batteries from each other to do that then?
236475,Roy,2008-08-05 14:14:00,13728,"No Scott, I run a 24V bowmount. You run a bank to each battery from the charger. If you want a diagram I'll PM you one."
236485,cranks bait,2008-08-05 14:23:00,721,"Thanks Roy.  I will take you up on that, once I figure out what I am doing."
