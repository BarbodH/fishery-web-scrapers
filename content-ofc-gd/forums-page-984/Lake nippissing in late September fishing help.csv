236543,michigander,2008-08-05 16:40:00,5,I will staying at Lakair the last week in September for just a few days and I would appreciate suggestions on fishing. I have been there before but earlier in the summer. All I want is a few eating size walleye and then fun with pike and maybe a musky. Do the locations of the walleye change this time of year? Deeper? What is the best way (tackle) I read the long topic on bottom bouncing... sounds good Anyadvice on all the above species is greatly appreciated Thanks
