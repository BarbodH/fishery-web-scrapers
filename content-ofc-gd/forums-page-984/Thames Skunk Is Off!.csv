236455,Marko,2008-08-05 13:38:00,854,"So now that you caught a fish i can consider you as my guide when i get up there. You raised the bar prety high by catching that monster.  Great fish none the less, way to go!"
236482,JohnF,2008-08-05 14:21:00,3494," I went back yesterday to see if he was still around, but no luck. Just little dinks. Something large was jumping close by and a few tapped at my worm, but nothing. Of course it was late morning and bright sun. I had a respectable one leap well clear of the water in front of me, spit the worm. I heard him chuckling as he dove.  C'mon down. I'll show you the spots and I have some new ones to explore.  JF"
236524,blaque,2008-08-05 15:49:00,2419," It wasnt the bright sun or the time of day that was the culprit, its all because you had to bring that stinkin camera lol They know, yupper.........they knooooow. I find the cell phone camera is a better option, Mr. Fish isnt up on the technology and he thinks it just makes phonecalls!!"
236530,Canuck2fan,2008-08-05 16:09:00,1444," Don't neglect the other side of the bridge either although it doesn't open into any decent pools for a couple of miles. Walking the creek either direction is tough if the silt doesn't get you a rock will bust a shin or ankle but for a long ways though there are trails along the side if you can find em as they tend to get overgrown. Just don't step on any wild turkeys or baby fawns. I have had a couple of close encounters... I was less than 2 feet from a fawn two years ago there before she jumped up and called to mama. I never had a clue it was there, no wonder when I was a kid my dad used to tell me to NEVER go lion hunting son you just aren't that observant LOL. This year a group of wild turkeys would not stop eating as I was approaching them, they would only run about 15 ft in front of me then grab some more corn. I pity them though if do go ahead with the bow season in there this fall for them.  Good thing there is no hunting strictly enforced because these birds are not shy at all."
236535,JohnF,2008-08-05 16:15:00,3494," So if they're so hip on technology, how come they didn't know the batteries were dead? As for the phone cam, I'm a bit of a cell luddite. None of my phones have built-in cams.  Next time I'll float the camera on a little raft with a long long line attached so it can be lurking somewhere downstream just in case I ever catch another fish. Mebbe that'll sneak it in under the radar.  JF"
236538,JohnF,2008-08-05 16:25:00,3494, What is it about the turkeys this year? I've never seen them so nonchalant. I saw two fairly large (family?) groups on the weekend out near the golf course.  Thanks for the tips.  JF
235769,JohnF,2008-08-03 21:20:00,3494," I'm not even sure I believe it now. It never occurred to me there were bass that big in my river. I might even take two cameras next time I go just in case.  I was gonna go tonight but I decided to wait for morning. If I can catch that same one again I want my buddy Rob to see it and he's away today, losing my floating rapalas that he borrowed probably. He hasn't caught one like that here either, and he has no faith in plastic worms, even though he's seen me catch lotsa smaller smallies with 'em. He figgers the raps are the only way to go.  BTW. I really like the o-ring idea. It allows the worm to scoot up the line away from the thrashing fishy and leaves it intact for later.  JF"
235789,Garry2Rs,2008-08-03 22:53:00,1425,Congratulations! The curse is lifted and life will be good again. I also had a good weekend. I will post when my pictures finish up-loading. G2r's
235790,JohnF,2008-08-03 22:55:00,3494," I will never doubt yer wisdom again, oh Revered BassMaster. You said ""Let it sink."" and I did.  JF"
235804,Canuck2fan,2008-08-03 23:57:00,1444, John I have no problem believing you.... I have caught 2 bass in a connecting river (creek really) that were monsters. The first one when I measured it on the rod came from the tip of the butt to just where the thread began to wrap around an eye. I showed my buddy who was with me when got home we measured the rod and the distance was 21 inches. That one was the baby. The next time I was out and alone I tied into something I thought it was a carp until it did a couple of tail walks.... When I landed it I was shocked it was not a particularly thick fish but when I hand spanned it the only thing I could do it went over 3 and a good bit. My hand span is 8.5 inches..... I know it wasn't that heavy a fish because it was early season but come fall fatty time it would have over 4.5lb for sure which would be pretty good for a river fish from around here. So there are some monsters in those waters. Same spot held some large pike too that year. Now it is all carp ( through there.
235815,JohnF,2008-08-04 00:19:00,3494," In that very same spot I had a spinner hit hard and broken off on the hit last summer. I'm sure it wasn't a pike up above the dam so I have to assume it was a big bass. Now I know there are bass big enuf to do that. This reel has braid. Last summer's reel probably had 4# mono on it, so if I screwed up and had the drag too tight ..... . Today's fish hit hard and then turned and ran straight at me. If he'd gone away and I had light mono with a tight drag he'd have been gonzo too.  Are you talking about a spot near a golf course by any chance?  JF"
236190,Canuck2fan,2008-08-04 22:58:00,1444, Nope not the golf course. If you know your dairies in the area think about how close one bridge is to one that sells/distributes Ault products. I was near there... Bit of a hike through some tough brush but it beats breaking ankles in the stream LOL.
236201,HTHM,2008-08-04 23:12:00,4082,looks like it is skunk genocide congrads!
236205,Leecher,2008-08-04 23:27:00,7832,"Thanks JohnF, it was a good read and congrats on your PB  Thanks for sharing Leechman"
236208,jjcanoe,2008-08-04 23:42:00,744,What happened to fly fishing for them John???   jjcanoe
236220,JohnF,2008-08-05 00:19:00,3494," They've been in hiding this year. I didn't want to squander my efforts with the flyrod if there were no takers. Now I know they're there, the flyrod and SingingDog's flies are coming out.  JF"
236307,tbayboy,2008-08-05 02:18:00,1497,"Congrats John.  Good to here the Thames is producing, haven't seen many reports from it this summer."
236372,outllaw,2008-08-05 11:08:00,1232,the thames is an awesome aqua culture. theres near 85 fish species in it. some of the species are rare and endangered. enjoy the river. i was at a presentation from a biologist from the uppper thames. amazing what the thames river holds. congrats on your exploration fishing trip.  this river needs friends.
236381,Victor,2008-08-05 11:34:00,1609,"Congrats JohnF! All the hardwork finally paid off for ya!  Don't worry, we believe you. You even told us that you attended carp orgy parties, so I'm pretty sure you never lie when it comes to fishing stories"
236432,JohnF,2008-08-05 12:49:00,3494, Who knew about carps' peculiar proclivities? I was young and naive then. Today I always get the facts before wading into a frenzied party group.  JF
236433,JohnF,2008-08-05 12:50:00,3494, Gotcha. Never tried up there but now I might.  JF
