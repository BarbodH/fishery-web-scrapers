My girlfriend bought a license for this yr before our houseboat trip in late june.  After doing some laundry without checking her pockets first, the sticker has come off of the card completely.  I know you cant get 2 licenses, can you get the sticker replaced though? anybody know who I'd contact.  Im gonna ask CT tomorrow, thats where she bought it.  Is there a database somewhere? thanks  Ryan"
