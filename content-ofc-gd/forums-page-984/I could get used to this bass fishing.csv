236191,Marko,2008-08-04 22:59:00,854,"On my way to Ottawa this weekend decided to stop at Mississippi river, i think. Figured i am going to check if the bass have returned to their little hole and get some rest after a long drive from Kitchener. Bought dozen of worms, split shot and a single hook, bottom bouncing for smallies. Sounds simple enough, it gets a little tricky with rocky bottom tho. Here are the results,   This guy was half decent and had a heck of a time pulling him through current.             And my personal best, this thing was a monster, my hands are fairly big so this picture does not do it much justice.    All in all, 90 minutes great spent, ran out of worms again, but will be back in couple of weeks. "

236273,Cudz,2008-08-05 01:36:00,2652,"Marko, great job.  I love the hands on method of holding the fish. lol"
236306,tbayboy,2008-08-05 02:16:00,1497,Yeah I'd say thats a decent 90 minutes worth.  Thanks for the great photos.
236393,Victor,2008-08-05 11:50:00,1609,WTG Marko! Looks like an even more successful trip compared to the last report that you did.  I particularly love the shot with the fish and the rod/reel on the rock.  Thanks for sharing!
236405,b2kptbo,2008-08-05 12:10:00,1505,"Beauty action for 90 minutes, gotta like went that happens, thanks for the report..."
236420,Marko,2008-08-05 12:34:00,854,"I tried liping that big one but didnt quite work out. My shirt was covered in fish slime, should have seen the look on my gf`s face when i showed up at her house lol. If looks could only kill haha, guess she knew what i was up to lol.  For some reason i thought only large mouths get lipped like that, not small mouths."
236424,JohnF,2008-08-05 12:39:00,3494," If there's room fer the hook(s) and yer thumb, go for it on any of our bass type fish. Admittedly it looks a little silly on some of the smaller models, but I think it's better for them if you're putting them back in the water.  JF"
236440,Marko,2008-08-05 13:04:00,854," Morning John, Yea all fish went back in the water, i`ll give it a try next time. Maybe i can lip some Thames bass when i catch them haha."
