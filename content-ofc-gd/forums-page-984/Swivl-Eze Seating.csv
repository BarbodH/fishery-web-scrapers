222336,Fishn Technishn,2008-07-03 00:36:00,198,"Man, am totally bummed out! Called my local dealer looking for a ""stand up pedestal"" for the front of the new boat. It is the Swivl-eze 2 3/8"" type post with a push button to lock/unlock at the bottom. The one I got quoted on goes to approx 36"" Guess how much they quoted me????  $217.00    no seat....just the power pedestal!!! I guess I will be standing WITHOUT the post!! Why is this one more than double all the others? Can anyone shed some light on this one? Anyone got one laying around or a ""Good Guy"" connection? Anyone else run into this?  Thanks,  FT"
222345,Dondorfish,2008-07-03 00:45:00,1000,Try Cabelas from the states:   http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&id=0001707   Hope that helps  Don  
222447,Blue_Axela,2008-07-03 03:12:00,88,"I'm in the same boat...well, not literally but I also need to get the pole and the swivel mount (Swivl-eze 2 3/8"") for my Starcraft.  I didn't want the power pedestial and it was still going to cost me $150 each!  I'm going to order them from Cabelas in the US."
222455,Fishn Technishn,2008-07-03 03:35:00,198,"Blue Axela, Yeah what a croc! Cabelas only has up to the 23"" power pedestal and I want the 32-36"" one!!  Maybe I will have to make my own!!  Let me know how you make out.  FT"
222497,motv8tr,2008-07-03 09:37:00,2587,"Huh, I put in a pedestal seat a couple of weeks ago, not a power post, but I like it, and it's tall enough.  Picked it up at BPS and I can promise you I didn't pay 150.00 for it!  I think the seat cost me 25, and I can't remember what the post was.  I'll be stopping in at BPS tomorrow and will take a look see and let you know if you want.  Maureen"
222550,Fishn Technishn,2008-07-03 12:16:00,198,"Thanks to all, for the assistance.  Mo, the one I am looking for is the swivl-eze 2 3/8 series see link. I would really prefer the tallest one I can get as my son is 6'4"" and I am a little less. We don't really sit at the front just usually stand & want one to basically lean against. Although once in a while my wife decides SHE wants the front & she MAY sit down. LOL  http://www.attwoodmarine.com/products/prod...eating+Hardware  I will keep looking  Thanks FT"
222553,Guest lundboy,2008-07-03 12:21:00,0,"Is it this type?  If it is, it's called a ""taper lock"" type.  You can probably get it off the shelf at Robinson Marine near Lindsay.705 324 1843 http://www.robinsonmarine.net/  Or Cabellas about $70 before shipping"
222589,Blue_Axela,2008-07-03 13:22:00,88,"Nah, thats not the type we are talking about.  We are talking about the 238 series that was used in the older boats (2000 to 2004 or so).  No one stocks the 238 series and you're going to pay an arm and leg to get them."
222601,Fishn Technishn,2008-07-03 13:40:00,198,"Blue Axela, you say 2000 -2004? My Sylvan is 2007! They must have bought a whole load of them and are trying to use them up!!  Just got a call from West Marine GTA saying they can get one  Special Order at $185 .....and it's gonna take 6-8 WEEKS!!!!!  FT"
222619,Blue_Axela,2008-07-03 14:05:00,88,"Dang FT!  I guess your hands are tied on this one since you want the 36"" model.  My Starcraft is a 2001, I had no idea they were still using the 238 series in newer boats.  Sadly, in 6-8 weeks...the fishing season will almost be over."
222714,Fishn Technishn,2008-07-03 17:26:00,198,"Blue Axela, just got back from a metal store here in London(Unlimited Metal). The have some 2 3/8 aluminum pipe, it is basically called 2"" pipe but the OD is actually 2 3/8. Got a 42""pieceof Schedule40(thick wall) for $20 & I can cut it to length for now. Just need to turn or sand down 1 end about 5 thousandths of an inch to fit the hole in the base. It will work until I figure out the power pedestal part.  FT"
223241,Fishn Technishn,2008-07-04 17:18:00,198,"EUREKA!!!  I think I may have found a possible solution! Went to my local marine Dealer( Hully Gully) they sell Tracker & Princecraft boats. The Princecraft is the Swivl-eze system like mine and the Tracker uses a Springfield system with a keyed slot in the base & post. You cannot use the Swivl-eze on the Springfield system BUT you CAN use the Springfield pedestal system on the Swivl-eze base. The Swivl-eze base has no inner keyed(with a groove) insert. I tried it ....ANDIT WORKS!! Better yet the Springfield 30"" Power pedestal is $86 at BPS http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults   Thanks to everyone for all of the suggestions,  FT"
223333,motv8tr,2008-07-04 20:31:00,2587,"Hey FT I was at BPS today, and found one I thought was Swivel - eze, but could have been springfield, 82.99 that was 24"" to 30""  Don't forget the price on the website is in US dollars Maureen"
223424,Fishn Technishn,2008-07-04 23:39:00,198,Thanks Mo!!  FT
236790,Blue_Axela,2008-08-06 01:24:00,88,"Well I finally got the Swivl-Eze static 9"" pedestials and seat mounts shipped over from the US.  They were purchased from Cabelas in MO.  "
