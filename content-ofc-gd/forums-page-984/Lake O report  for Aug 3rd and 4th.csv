236414,rhare,2008-08-05 12:24:00,387,"Spent the weekend fishing the big lake. The weather was great all weekend and the fishing just as good.  Aug 3rd   Headed out fairly early and started fishing at 80fow working out to 120ft well the light was low. Didnt take all that long and we started the day off with a decent king. We managed a couple early and then pulled up and headed for the deep water. The bows picked up out deeper and we managed a few decent fish including one just over 10lbs. 30ft down and 50ft back. blue spoons. 2.7mph. We finished the day 11 for 15.                Aug 4th  Found the fishing much tougher, tried a variety of spoons,depths,speeds and just couldnt get many hits. The first couple fish we got were on the smaller side 1-2lbs. Then I got into a nice big king just what Ive been looking for. After a few good runs out comes the hook. We did get a couple decent fish. Dan and I managed a nice double header. My friend Alex got his PB bows he was all smiles. We went 5 for 12 with fish coming from 40-65ft in 320 fow 15-20ft back. 3.1-3.5mph seemed to work best.   "

236514,Joey,2008-08-05 15:33:00,9122,We were out there too yesterday.  Decent weather and decent fishing.  Looks like you did very well  Joey
236528,Headhunter,2008-08-05 15:58:00,5703,"Nice report and fishies! Just wondering though, did any of those Bow's survive? The reason I'm asking is that last year I was out and virtually every Bow succumbed to the warm water at the surface of the lake... we had to keep everything or waste it. Did you experience the same thing? HH"
236616,b2kptbo,2008-08-05 18:53:00,1505,Good one...
236622,solopaddler,2008-08-05 19:02:00,8605,Nice job boys!
236631,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-05 19:17:00,2585,great job out there!  looks like a great day with some good fish being caught!  cheers!
236642,SlowPoke,2008-08-05 19:34:00,2984,"The 'bows are fragile and I'm not sure if it's just the warmer water at the surface. Many of these 'bows will rocket from 80' to your lure at 35' and break the surface within seconds and fight themselves to near-death. I tend to think the warmer water is a contributing factor and makes revival tougher but not the sole cause of death. On sunday we got one in cold (62*surface), reletively shallow water (100') and we were unable to revive it. We picked up 10 more in warmer (74*surface), deep water (320'-360') and had to take home five that wouldn't revive. Many of the non-survivors were breathing fine but kept rolling over. Lakers and salmon tend to fight more at thier depth, come up slowly and are much easier to revive. -Brian"
236705,rhare,2008-08-05 22:37:00,387,"Yeah I find that some of the fish just cant be released. I keep that back livewell filling with fresh water and add a bit of ice to cool it off, give them a few min. in there to burp and most swim away well. Ive seen some floating around out there that didnt make it from people just tossing them back."
