236451,Headhunter,2008-08-05 13:31:00,5703,"I have two Okuma Convectors and one Diawa Sealine, The Sealine is pushing 15 years old and I have NEVER had any issue with it at all. Now, when I was looking at buying two more line counter reels, it was suggested that I look at the Convector's as they are a bit cheaper, $30.00 roughly then the Sealines. I bought two. Well, the anti-reverse switch on both of them is hit and miss at best. I usually use them for trolling boards or lead core and have had BOTH of them screw up on me under load. Not what I'm looking for in a reel at all. On the positive side, I like the extra large handle on the Okuma, feels good and strong while your winching in, but in reality, if I had removed the pin in my butt (it holds my wallet very tightly to my butt) and coughed up the extra $30.00 per reel for the Sealine, I would have three excellent reels that I can feel confident, I'll be passing along to my kids one day. At this point, I have confidence that I'll be passing one reel down to my kids, and a couple of very shiny paper weights! HH"
236457,Roy,2008-08-05 13:38:00,13728,Was a decent rant as rants go. Sorry mr.mike. you lost this one.
236229,Greencoachdog,2008-08-05 00:28:00,8163,"Being such an astute OFNer and making the comment about my content free ""nice fish"" type 3 word stuff (and with you not being any where smart enough to figure it out) I guess I must point it out to you, one of your so called CORE MEMBERS seem to have the right to attack and belittle anyone they like on this site( and I truly do believe his IQ aint all that high) has made at least 1000 of his 6000+ posts with the exact CONTENT FREE ""GREAT REPORT< NICE PICS type 3 word stuff, but because he has high post number he is a OFC GOD, so go read the posts over again and put it all together and you (well maybe not you,get some help) will see that it is a spoof to one of your know it all 6000+ posters.  And seriously how the hell does a person make so many freakin post on any site, for gods sake man get a freakin life. HOLDFAST keep up the good work and thanks for keepin my country the best in the world.   My aren't you the eloquent one!!! You're such a charmer and say the sweetest things!!!  I think I've come up with a solution that will solve Kempers problem and make everyone on this thread happy... I'll be back in a bit with it."
236264,HTHM,2008-08-05 01:27:00,4082,"Insert ""Church Lady's"" voice here: ""Well isn't this special"""
236308,Greencoachdog,2008-08-05 02:18:00,8163,"I think the best solution for this whole argument would be for MrMike and Holdfast to give Kemper $100 each for his reel and they could destroy it and throw it in the garbage and be assured that nobody would get ripped off by buying a bad reel. This would also show that they are truly men of their words and not just little fingers on a keyboard.  Kemper could give/send the reel to either MrMike or Holdfast, which would destroy the reel with a hammer or other means and take pics of it and post them on the board... this way we would all be sure they did ""The Right Thing"" and are the men they say they are.  Unless of course throwing the reel in the garbage is only the right thing to do when it's someone else's money!   What do you say men?... ready to put your money where your typing fingers are?"
236327,holdfast,2008-08-05 03:34:00,1813,"Thats a Negative Big Fella.  Ill stick to what Ive got.  Just to change the subject, Im thinking of using my old Mitchell 300 reel that I found in the Garbage and hooking it up with a 9 foot light salmon Rod and fish the Dirty old Saskatchewan River.  Bet ya the drag is as good as the Okuma 200 dollar reel.  Dont call me Fossil, but I couldnt see a classic reel go in the Garb"
236419,MrMike,2008-08-05 12:33:00,153,"   Maybe you could explain how passing on a reel to either one of us changes this whole senario one bit, all your solution does is pass it on to someone(WOULD BE JUST LIKE SELLING IT) other than whoses problem it is(THE BUYER) unfortunatly for Kemper if Okuma doesnt come good on their goods he is and should be the one stuck with it, so again all your doing is trying to pass a piece of crap to another person down the line, and again all you have done is provin the American mentallity and tried to shame and bully(What do you say men?... ready to put your money where your typing fingers are?) someone into taking a stance, where you seem to have gone wrong is now you some how want me to say because I dont think anyone else should get ripped off, I should be the one to step up and get ripped off(I can see how you had to wait to post your solution, because it probably takes a little time to gather all the cousins together and try and find an answer)  Bottom line agian ITS WRONG TO SELL SOMEONE SOMETHING YOU KNOW IS NO GOOD thats my morals and the way I live my life, you on the other hand feel its your right to rip off the next guy because it happened to you.  You cant win this because you and your morals are WRONG and all the years of breeding from your gene pool have put you at such a disadvantage.  GREAT REPORT NICE PICS  GREEN TROUT   And by the way I have enough class not to insult your vets and the young men dieing to save your sorry   and I have seen you insult Holdfast a number of times in the past and for this I think your a pile of chiiit"
236423,Greencoachdog,2008-08-05 12:39:00,8163," No no no Son!!!  It's not passing it down, you will throw it in the garbage so nobody else will get it... get it???"
236428,danbo,2008-08-05 12:43:00,2646,"Man, I've been banned for less.."
236434,MrMike,2008-08-05 12:50:00,153,"    What part dont you get about how its not my problem ITS THE BUYERS, the same as he shouldnt give it to you to sell to someone else to recoup his money. Man your just not bright enough to get it.   Google BILL ENGELS heres your sign"
236436,danbo,2008-08-05 12:57:00,2646,Yo MissMikey..why don't ya go back to your nude-badminton site..
236437,Greencoachdog,2008-08-05 13:00:00,8163,"  That's what I thought, throwing it in the trash is only the right thing to do when it's someone else's money and not yours.  I was sure I could count on you to do the right thing and give Kemper his money back and dispose of the reel properly so nobody else would run the risk of getting ripped off... guess I was wrong."
236444,MrMike,2008-08-05 13:12:00,153,"     How thick in the head are you man, This is between Okuma and Kemper no one else its not up to anyone to step up make it their problem. This was a moral question and like your morals your a freakin idiot, have fun with your redneck clan unfortunatly you have probably already breed so your gene will live on for at least another generation"
236449,Greencoachdog,2008-08-05 13:29:00,8163,I am finished with this thread.  I would like to commend Sam of Carra Outdoors for offering to exchange Kempers reel for him even though he didn't purchase the reel there!!!  Sam is a First Class guy all the way!!!  I will definitely be stopping into his store the next time I'm in the area!!!
236450,Joey,2008-08-05 13:31:00,9122,"You got that right GCD, Sam is one Class Act!!!  I won't even comment on What Mr. Mike has said, but it is the opposite of the above statement.  Joey"
236002,Dabluz,2008-08-04 13:02:00,701,"Went walleye fishing with my Okuma Stinson spinning reel yesterday.  For a spinning reel that sells in the 50 dollar range, it's a fine reel.  Very smooth, very tight (no loose parts), very quiet and an excellent clutch.  I was using 6 lb test mono.  On top of that, it's a good looking reel.  I'm quite sure that the anti-reverse gear in the reel (see first message) was just cleaned and lubed by the repairman.  Now that the anti-reverse acted up again, it's pretty certain that it will have to be replaced instead of serviced.  I'd give 20 dollars for the reel and I will buy a new part for it and fix it myself.  That way, I will know that it is fixed.  Some people can be hard on their equipment.  I see lots of used baitcasters for sale and you can always read the following comment....""reel has some boat rash"".  This means that the reel was permanently sitting on a rod.  I never let my reels sit permanently on a rod.  Part of going fishing is setting up my rods for the day.  This means putting a clean reel on a clean rod and tying your lure to good mono using a fresh knot.  I take apart my reels regularly.  I clean and lubricate them regularly.  Sure they do get the occaisonal scratch (I do a lot of shore fishing in very rough conditions) but that is called ""normal usage"".  Since they do not sit permanently on a rod, they are almost pristine in appearance.  I guess that due to the fact that I do not have any money makes me appreciate what toys that I do have, a lot more."
236005,Roy,2008-08-04 13:05:00,13728,Thanks for putting it back on track Dabluz.
235567,kemper,2008-08-02 22:22:00,2232,"Last year I bought an Okuma V series baitcaster, which is a high end model that cost a lot of money.  It worked GREAT...for three days and then the clutch bearing crapped out of the levelwinder broke. After a few emails it was repaired on warrantee and put away for the next summer's trip. Well this year the reel worked great again, for ONE DAMN DAY! Again, the anti reverse cluthc bearing blew up.  I have been delaying this  rant on the chance that Okuma fixes this slip up, but they have been ignoring my kind and civil emails for weeks. This service is CRAP and unacceptable! I got a grand total of 3 days use out of a $200+ reel and the company wont even reply to my emails?  What do I do? (other than replace it with a shimano...which i have already done)"
235573,Greencoachdog,2008-08-02 22:32:00,8163,"That's a tough break, maybe have it fixed and try to sell it.  What were you thinking when you didn't buy a Shimano in the first place?... There's a reason that a lot of us here are dyed in the wool Shimano men. Quality and service!  Another life lesson learned."
235588,danbo,2008-08-02 23:34:00,2646,"Can you say ""D-A-I-W-A-?"""

235594,silveradosheriff,2008-08-02 23:44:00,1025,"Very disappointing indeed.  Not sure who you have called, but you can contact Mike at Okuma at 1-800-GO-OKUMA x 151."
235596,Canuck2fan,2008-08-02 23:49:00,1444, I am hearing that Shimano is not standing behind product the way they used to either.... It seems that in a tightening economy that having to replace rods constantly for people who can't stop slamming them in car doors is costing too much money.... Our local tackle shop owner is pretty embarassed that he can't get Shimano to replace more than a couple of rods that supposedly have a life time warranty....
235603,danbo,2008-08-03 00:10:00,2646,Notice how Shimano is spelled?... S-H-I-___ !

And have never had any problems with it. Sorry to hear the service /warr. sucks on it but would defiantly buy another,and hope nothing goes wrong with it."
235624,danbo,2008-08-03 01:01:00,2646,
235626,jace,2008-08-03 01:02:00,472,that sucks.   the reel turned out to be a $70/day rental.    Contact one of their service centers (one of the very few) to order the bearing and replace it yourself.    Mikes reel repair on the west coast also carries reel bearing upgrades for most brands and might be able to help you even though it's the roller you need.    Not many reels have good anti-reverse rollers including shimano..all shimanos.
235627,danbo,2008-08-03 01:04:00,2646,  This video helped me learn to count all the way up to 4..  Life's too short..to own an UGLY reel!!!
235649,mattyk,2008-08-03 01:42:00,2110,My vote is for a shimano!
235650,DT10Sam,2008-08-03 01:43:00,480,"Hi Kemper,  Okuma policy is over the counter exchange........I would take it back to where you purchased and have them replace it.  If you do not have any luck I will give you a number of who to call ...............Canadian Distributor.   Regards, Sam"

235722,Dabluz,2008-08-03 15:54:00,701,"I have an Okuma Stinson spinning reel.  Works nice and smooth with an excellent clutch and anti-reverse.  However, after a 2 months of use, it started to jam up on me.  I took it apart and lubed it.  Works great now.  Ok....it's not an expensive reel but it is quite decent.  I had the same problem (reel jamming up) with an Abu Garcia Ultra Lite Pro (quite expensive too) that I bought about 15 years ago.  The company re-lubed it for me and it has been working fine since then.  However, in those days, instant anti-reverse in tiny reels was hard to find.  My Shimano Symetre 2000 that I bought about 10 years ago and have used extensively, works as well if not better than the day I bought it.  I carry all of my reels in small cloth bags and install the reels on the rods when I get to the fishing site."
235723,BabyHerc,2008-08-03 16:03:00,285,  I sure can!  What the heck is a Shimano?
235725,Handlebarz,2008-08-03 16:12:00,3790,I am sorry to here of the trouble your having I have been using the Okuma line counters for the last few years for musky and have not had any problems (knock on wood) I also bought a avenger 15 spinning reel it has been great since may and I just ordered 2 more last week. I have also bought two other line counters for rainbow fishing they look and feel great I will see. I know if you were to go to Angling outtfitter in woodstock they will give you over the counter replacement as this is what I was told when at teh London show by the owner when I bought one from him he sais Okuma stands behind there stuff. I also have another friend who uses just Okuma and loves them.  Hope you look into it more as it sounds like crap that you got so far I would put $$$ on the fact that they will help you out.

All I had to do was call them in California toll free give them the specs and serial number and they said mail them a 2"" piece of the rod with the serial # and 15$ for shipping and all is well. I will tell you how that turns out but give them a ring, hopefully they fix their mistake. Good luck"
