235918,Leecher,2008-08-04 05:19:00,7832,"Today my friend Paul and I decided we'd target our favorite lake and try for eyes..... Since the weatherman was calling for cloudy periods and a risk of thunderstorm in the afternoon, we left a little later than usual.  Got there around 10:30am and did not take long, Paul gets a hit and lands a 16"" eye....    A little time pass and I get a hit..... but it's a largemouth    At first sight, near the boat, I thought it was an eye.... Gave me a good fight and got airborn a couple of times... She was around 3ish I figure.    Then hold and behold, Paul gets a another hit...... This time it's a smallmouth and a football size one....It was taking drag and doing arials....Gave him a good fight.    We tried for a little while longer but did not get another eye to strike our jigs.... so we moved to another location and same results.  Since the rain was on / off all afternoon, we decided to take a break from the eyes and target bass.  The back bays of this lake is full of heavy salad cover and know that it's only a boat ride away...... Off we go.... get our rods setup with scum frogs.... and the fun begins.  Here's some pics of the back bays action.                This one just inhaled my spro.    And out of nowhere comes this pike that jumped on Pauls scum frog.... A good 3lber    All fish were released, except for the eye..... ummm little lunch Great day to be out on the water and great fun! Hope you guys enjoy this report Until next time Leechman"

236203,Leecher,2008-08-04 23:20:00,7832,"Thanks again guys.... was a fun day full of excitement.... we did get rained on quite a few times throughout the day but managed to keep somewhat dry   .... can't wait to do it again.... may be next time, the eyes will be cooperating a bit more     This lake has a lot of potential and we've yet to get into a frenzy with them  Will sure keep plugin at it this season and if were not successfull.... well will try them on hard water next season coming..... Here a pic of one of our outing last year in February....    I know they're there....Just a matter of locating the school of them  Again everyone, thanks for the kind replies Leechman"
