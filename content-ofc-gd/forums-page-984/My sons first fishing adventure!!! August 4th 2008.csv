We took him to a little spot on 16 mile creek.  My wife showed him how to reel in while i took the pics and video.  After she showed him once he wanted to do it all on his own.  It was pretty cute to watch!  I tied on a small tube about an inch and a small jig and on the second cast he caught one!  His first fish was this little guy.  A nice little rock bass!    He didn't want to touch it all he wanted me to do was put it back in so he could catch it again lol   My son and wife looking at his second fish only a few casts later.    This one was a little bigger and again he wanted us to put it in so he could catch it again.    Here is a video of him reeling in, hard to explain the smile it put on my face watching this.
