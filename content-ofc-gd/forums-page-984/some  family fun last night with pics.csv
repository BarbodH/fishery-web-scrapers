And we were only using glup turtle back worms for the harness and slow death pumpkin seed, Green pumpkin seed and june bug well there goes my secret color hope ya all try it out it does out perform the real stuff on my boat we have used it all summer with the same rigs and live crawlers and the Gulp did its job each time out.  the wifes PB SM 19"" caught on the Slow Death rig   Jades first eye of the night caught on hammered copper with red bead harness   another 18"" range eye that fell for teh gulp turtle back worm on the harness   this one did not want a picture taken he just wanted back os off he went right back from the net caught on a deep diving crank bait black back with silver.   nice 20"" and biggest of the night all others looked like the same fish about 18"" this one was fooled by a fire tiger deep diver and also was fiesty as hell the wife had one hell of a time holding him for a pic    this guy here was fun and yet another who wanted to get back and was fooled by the turtle back worm and slow death rig the wife went to take the pic of me and my daughter but she had another on the line and this one was heading back on his own great shot from the night.   the double header LOL I cant remember what my daughter said here but it was funny must have been something about only getting a Rock Bass for the double header   we were the only ones out in the area and from what others said they did nothing all afternoon I guess it pays to change things up a little."
