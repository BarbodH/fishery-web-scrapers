236384,Victor,2008-08-05 11:39:00,1609,Nice bucket there CC! I too find it a bit weird that you're holding a bass in a tshirt
236390,ccmtcanada,2008-08-05 11:47:00,7971," The first time I met Scott on the tribs, he was telling me that before he got right into steelheading that he focussed mainly on bass.  It looks like he's come full circle, using his experiences on the tribs and tips from more knowledgeable folks like yourself to excel at another species.  I have a feeling he's counting his pennies right now trying to figure out how to get himself a bass boat....LOL."
236391,Bly,2008-08-05 11:48:00,1556,Excellent bass Scotty!!   Props to Mark!
236480,Mark Kulik,2008-08-05 14:21:00,348,"Thats how it worked for me ccmt I fished bass, then a lot of downrigging for salmon, steelheading the spring winter fall, ocasional bass, pike,musky walleye, I got into touneys by accident , my buddys former partner won 649 -went downhill real fast-I volunteered,that was 8 yrs. ago, and the rest is history, it is a real learning curve I do have to say, but Scotts doing it the way he should-get info and apply it the only real place it counts-on the water!"

236309,Mark Kulik,2008-08-05 02:22:00,348,"Bob Izumi told me that some of the best steelheaders become successful bass anglers, I think it's about feel and attention to detail, sure takes some time on the lake to figuire out a new specie , so-Scotts hooked, just a matter of time before I see him beside me in his new bass-boat at blast-off!"
