Some nice eater size crappie/perch/walleye from earlier in the season:    Above average size Pigeon Lake LM, caught on the flats tossing a moss-boss of all things - great fight, 18.5"" and just a hair under 4#.  A little skinny, but still a nice fish.    Last but not least.....My new '08 Sierra.  Picked this up on Thursday night.  Runs real nice, ride is firm, but also comfortable.  I know, I know, the gas.....I knew what I was getting into and I have $0.40 cents off for 2500 litres to start, so that will ease things for awhile.  Here she is, all nicely waxed up:          Just need a new matching boat to go along with the truck now.  Tightlines fellas....."

236117,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-04 19:07:00,0,"Great report. Looks like a few good fish fries there. Nice truck too!  Moss boss you say? When I started getting into lures, I went to the store and asked the guy to pick out some lures for me. One was a mossboss. When I tried it out and seen that it was made of plastic and hardly sank? I felt ripped off.lol Now I know its called mossboss for a reason. I end up trying to break the spoon and modify it and it eventually was unusable.lol. Never really used it much, but I have heard it is a decent lure."
