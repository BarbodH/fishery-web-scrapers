235852,Mike the Pike,2008-08-04 01:56:00,3421,After not going to cousin Percher's last year for Salmon fishing there was no way I was going to pass up an opportunity to go Salmon fishing this year.  So off we went Friday night and drove the 6 hours from Montreal to Burlington Ontario arriving late.  Friday I got to bed late and could barely sleep my son Ryan and I got up just after five   and were excited about finally going Salmon fishing on Big Lake Ontario after a little rain we proceeded to the boat Launch.   At the Launch we were greeted by this gentleman(Biteme).It was good to see you again Peter. Now I wonder if this affected me but Pete told me his Dog got prayed by a skunk saturday night. Now no no no.Talking about skunk around me oh no NOT SO GOOD  .    The late night arrival and early rising was sure affecting Juniors spunkyness.Believe me he would soon be awake.   Well after not more than five minutes Junior gets his first ever Salmon the smile on his face was wider than the fish.Dan and I had discussed giving Ryan the first Rod that goes off and the little man got what he came for.   My tour guide for the weekend Captain Percher.  After a little over 4 hours fishing in the morning we packed it in until Saturday evening. Ryan's Salmon would be the only one for the morning.   We were back on the water around 4pm hoping for a king but the fishing was slow notta a snif.   That is my Cousin Brent's boat (Percher's Brother and as you can see a pretty good chop.  This of course was affecting my little guy the beginning of motion sickness which he never had before He had seen chop like this  before and never ever got sick.   Then it came to me why he was feeling woozy he had been exposed to Biteme.   At this point I am feeling guilty for not bringing the little Lad back in but now its too late. Over the boat he goes Looking Like Biteme the Pro The good news was he was no where as good as Biteme he survived the evening with no discharge Just feeling a little more woozy  Time to head in no Salmon .Thats fishing.Must of been the Dried Banana's Percher had in the dried fruit and nut mix. I needed some kind of excuse and found one.   Sunday morning and we get out nice and early once again.   The time came and I had my chance at a King 30 seconds of the reel screaming and fish gone I was devistated that was some pull.Had not caught a salmon since 1981.  We got right back to it.   Found these great gentleman on the water.Biteme and Pointed. Remember that boat porn Peter had promised us but never did show us well here it is. Only the Lakair family saw his nice boat.I like it Pete now get some slime in it will ya.    Late nights and early mornings caught up with my young fishing partner a 2 hour snooze.  Finally a Great lakes trout(Rainbow) for Team #6.Got rid of the skunk barely.Believe it or not that little thing is my new PB Rainbow at 22 inches.      Had this guy find us our good friend Slowpoke.Good to see ya Brian eventhough it was only five minutes.   Slowpokes buddy has a nice boat.   Now that looks like too much work.   Me and my best buddy my Son.   Cousin Percher.  Have to thank you one more time Dan thanks again for inviting us to come down The fishing was tough as it was for most who were out this weekend but you managed to get us a couple of fish. The many years I have gone fishing with you and our family just keep getting better.  I look forward to our next Adventure Dan.  Thanks so much Ryan and Mike
235861,Joey,2008-08-04 02:14:00,9122,"Super report Mike.  Looks like you all had a great time.  I feel for the wee one, I've felt like that many a time on the Big O.  Congrats to him on his Salmon.  Joey"

235895,douG,2008-08-04 03:31:00,2693,"Mike, great to see shots of you, and some other OFNrs.  That was tough work for a few feesh, but you did better than I did off Port Hope this morning, with not a single one of God's Perfect Little Aquatic Angels being harmed.  Good Onya, and to Ryan too."

236021,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-04 13:27:00,0,"Congrats on your son's first Salmon! His arms must have got a good workout. Too bad about the motion sickness. You may want to bring Gravol on the next trip, just in case.....Congrats on your PB bow too. Thanks for sharing."
236063,PERCHER,2008-08-04 17:06:00,787,It was a pleasure as usual having you guys out.Maybe next time we can hit some bigger fish. Dan

236068,huntervasili,2008-08-04 17:16:00,1604,"Looks like a darn good time for you all on the water. Not too much better than spending time on the water with family and friends. And as for Johnny Bass's suggestion I would bring Gravol, which has done wonders for my brother in the terms of motion sickness."
236160,Mike the Pike,2008-08-04 21:58:00,3421, Ah Emil the hats are getting better bud and I am sure if you ask Wayne he would be very willing to give you his  This is the hat I got from Lund much better .     MTP
236241,ccmtcanada,2008-08-05 00:45:00,7971,"Sweet report Mike!  Glad to see that both of you got into some nice looking fish.  Sorry to see your son not doing well with the sea sickness, but I have a feeling if you asked him, he'd do it all again in a heartbeat.  All these reports with your son and family are great to read Mike...he'll always remember these times that the two of you spent out on the water....doing father/son stuff!  Sorry we weren't around at home on your drive home.  Would have been great to see you and your son, but we hadn't taken our poor boat out in over a month....and we jumped at the chance....the weather and timing all lined up....LOL.  Good to see you saw a bunch of other OFNers...even if one of them was Brian.....haha."
236314,Mike the Pike,2008-08-05 02:33:00,3421, Hey Cliff I was so looking forward to stopping at your place on the way home but I understand fishing comes before socializing  And once you buy a boat it can't sit there .  BTW we were at the Whitby exit in 50 mins.We stopped in Bowmanville I had Timmies and Ryan had some Wendy's for lunch.My chevy Malibu amazed me I got 750kms from 55 litres of gas and it has a V6.There will be a next time cause that Salmon fishing sure has my attention.I hope to meet your whole family in the very near future.  See ya soon MTP
236367,SlowPoke,2008-08-05 10:54:00,2984,"Ouch! Carole, give him a smack for me please."
