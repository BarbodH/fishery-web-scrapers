236037,Popr,2008-08-04 14:25:00,7,Hi Guys and Girls:  Quick question. What causes knots in braided line. I'm using a spinning reel and I keep getting knots. Is this common and is there a solution or should I go back to mono.  Popr
236039,muskymike,2008-08-04 14:57:00,772,"Not sure what it could be, is the line too loose on the spool and coming off and over looping? I have been using braid for a long time now and I have never had one not in it."
236041,BillM,2008-08-04 15:06:00,17367,Try letting all your line out and reeling it in wet.  A seasoned musky pro gave me this tip and I've experienced a lot less hassles with braid since then.
236042,Popr,2008-08-04 15:12:00,7,Thanks for for advice guys. I usually soak my mono line in warm water to help reduce line curl.  popr.
236045,douG,2008-08-04 15:28:00,2693,"Use a good quality swivel to reduce line twist.  If things get gnarly, troll your line behind your boat, then reel it in with a finger pinch to provide some tension.  Like Mike said, if your spool is overfull, you're in for a world of grief until you cut away the excess."
236047,cpguy29,2008-08-04 15:34:00,148,I find I have hte same problem with my spinning reel and braided line...especialy making short casts. You also gotsta make sure the line it taught before you start reeling in.

236074,JohnF,2008-08-04 17:42:00,3494," Funny, I was getting the same thing yesterday with my new spinning reel. It's got lighter braid than the other reel has. I was trying to toss a plastic worm a long way on a 7' rod. Today I had the same reel and line and lure on a 5 1/2 footer and had no problem at all.  JF"
236112,BillsTheBassMan,2008-08-04 18:52:00,932," I switched to braid near the start of this season (only my second year actively fishing) and I also use a spinning  setup.  I am using Spiderwire.  I have not been getting any knots whatsoever, but I have found that the braid gets wrapped around my eyes and rod tip quite frequently for some reason - this happens a lot when I am fishing any kind of ""popping"" lure.  I think the advice to close your bail manually is good advice, since I always do this when I cast.  Also, based on my limited experience with braid, I would say, stick with it.  It takes some learning and a few struggles (with leader-tying and frays etc) but I think it is the best line for most situations."
