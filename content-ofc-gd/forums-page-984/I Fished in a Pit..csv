235776,Rich,2008-08-03 22:13:00,3927,"Wasn't going to make a report of this but figured what the heck.  Headed out to a local old gravel pit that I've never fished before. Was hoping it had some bass but all I could manage through the day was a ton of small crappie. Brought limited gear since this was basically a scouting mission, and just about everything I brought caught some crappies. Good to know a spot nearby with them, will come in handy for ice fishing. Otherwise, I don't think I'll visit it again too often. Too many better bass spots nearby.      You can see how crystal clear the water was in this pic:    And when I finally had some weight on the line, it turned out to be a crappie with 5lbs of weeds attached, lol  "
235780,misfish,2008-08-03 22:30:00,29133,You have a gold mine there. Nice fine.
235781,Wild,2008-08-03 22:31:00,704,"Looks like a great place to fish just the same Rich, we all should be so lucky to have a spot near by."
235800,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-03 23:45:00,0,Sounds like a fun day. I was drop shooting on Couch and nailing one little guy after another and I still had a blast.I wonder if they are bigger in the fall? I would imagine so.
235806,Greencoachdog,2008-08-04 00:00:00,8163,"I really enjoy fishing strip pits like that!  I've found that wearing camo clothing and staying low or hiding behind trees and rocks really helps when the water is crystal clear like that.  My lures and bait of choice in pits is a 1/8th oz. white inline spinner on 4 lb test on ultra lite tackle, or a single #6 baitholder hook with a 3 in. piecs of live worm with a BB shot about 18"" up from the hook on the same tackle."
235825,jediangler,2008-08-04 01:10:00,1923,"Nice work Rich. I haven't really hit any pits this year yet, guess I better start."
235829,Cudz,2008-08-04 01:26:00,2652,Nice looking pit.   love how the crappie hits a x-rap.  They are not shy.  I had one hit an x-rap as well.
235855,Clampet,2008-08-04 02:00:00,1947,That gives a whole new meaning to being 'down in the pits'.
235885,Leecher,2008-08-04 03:20:00,7832,Great report and pics Rich  Thanks for sharing Leechman
235963,MrMike,2008-08-04 11:47:00,153,wonder how the fish got planted there?
236212,Rich,2008-08-04 23:45:00,3927,"Hard to say. My first guess is that one of the local farmers put them in. I find it weird however that there are 3 ponds in this place and only one seems to have any fish, and that they're seemingly just crappie. So it could have been a natural introduction. Who knows."
236406,Victor,2008-08-05 12:10:00,1609,Thanks for the pics Rich. I'm so jealous how you've got so much water to fish/explore just around your area.
