I was talkin to a concervation officer rigth after i caught her, liscence check lol. and he was saying that it was proboly a hatchery fish from new york because it had a pelvic fin clipped. Do they clip hatchery fish from Ontario?"

64670,highdrifter,2007-04-25 18:53:00,2534,Hey Kewl!  Never hooked up with a brownie on that side...  Nice fish!  tight loops  HD
64714,Jonaton,2007-04-25 21:59:00,72,While that is a lovely fish was anyone going to tell him that the pike he was fishing for are out of season? Can't think of anything else you would try to catch with a bucktail.
64726,Carp,2007-04-25 22:41:00,1488,Beauty trout.  Congrats.
64728,Ben_Daniels,2007-04-25 22:59:00,435,"I was using a 1/8 oz, 1/2 inch blue fox spinner that I put a bucktal trebble on.... not really a pike lure at all"
64848,Bob,2007-04-26 11:07:00,370,"I have fished trout for years with spinners, often with dressed hooks (hair, feathers etc.) and I've fished early season trout with 5"" rapalas very successfully.  I caught my biggest pike at 43"" on the same rapala. I can't fathom why anyone would ASSUME someone was targetting OOS fish at the mention of a lure type.  Many lures are good for multiple species.  Are we going to call for a restriction of lure types which are allowed if there happens to be a OOS species that may hit said lure?  Too much!"
236319,nkranger,2008-08-05 02:50:00,6,hello every1 where in ashbrigdes bay is a place to fish?? i have never fished there. If ya no of ne good spots in toronto let me no (fishin from shore)
