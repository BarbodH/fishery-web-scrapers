235802,Garry2Rs,2008-08-03 23:54:00,1425,"Saturday morning Natalie, my eight year old neighbor came over with her Dad to see if I wanted to go fishing.  They knew I'd had company the night before and thought that I might be disabled...wink, wink. I was in fine form and we set a time to leave that allowed for various odd jobs to be taken care of. We set out for a lake that isn't part of the Kawarthas, but is closely related to them. Once on the water we checked out likely looking cover with Flukes and Senko type worms. Natalie opened the action with this SMB.  I followed moments later with this little guy on a Fluke.  I was looking for some LMBass for a client that was scheduled for Sunday... We hop-scotched down the lake checking weedy bays and downed timber. At the back of the lake we found a natural spring bubbling up through the weeds...I got a nice one there.  Note the red pants...It had rained (as usual) and this time I was wise enough to put on the rain pants!  Grin.  This morning my client and I  returned to the scene of the crime. Today the LMB's seemed to be relating to wood... Every downed tree or stump was worth checking out. We found lots of medium and small Bass but here's a couple of nice ones. This one came from beside a log in only a couple of feet of very clear water.  This was the ""Catch of the Day.""  Five pounds five ounces on the digital scale... On a Texasaposed 5"" rootbeer worm.  I cast between the two stumps behind me, in a foot of water. I didn't see the fish, but the line started to move and I tighted up the slack.  This baby just pulled drag whenever it wanted...I fought to keep it from going back into the wood, where it could break the line or pop the hook. After the photo it went over the side to fight another day...grin. Garry2R's"
