594230,Leecher,2011-06-18 23:23:00,7832,"Well folks, today got back into hunting the pokadots that eluded me since opening day    along the shoreline of my favorite lake   to see if they were hungry   Winds were from the West and like the old saying goes ""winds from the West... they byte the best"" well that statement hold true today  The action was fast and furious   Didn't even have time to take pics.... sorry   Hour and a half is all it took to limit out    So since I don't have pics.... here's the story.... hope you enjoy the reading   It's a long one  Left home around 9:15am and got to destination around 10:50am, there was a couple of boats out on the water and my favorite spot on shore was all mine   No one around   Lots of wind today so that meant no BUGS   I could see clouds of minnows cruising tight to shore where I was  Going solo, I always text my Mrs when I get to destination to let her know that I arrived and I'm still alive     Suffice to say that today I decided to setup my rod and then text but as soon as I had it in the water.... got a hit and miss     Reeled in my line to check on the dewie and what do you know    It's gone  Got another nice piece on and setup again.... not 15 seconds went by and I get hit... this time I set the hook and land my first    a small one but it goes into the cooler on ice     Then the thought of texting came about and proceeded to do it with the first fish in the box  The action never stopped until I got my limit.... an hour and half (11:11am - 12:33pm to be exact  )   A lot of them got off the hook just reeling in at shore and some were just miss hook sets due to having a big piece of dewie on the hook   I ajusted that quickly by just putting a smaller piece covering the point of the hook, since they were so hungry    Boy that sure is a change from the previous outings I had.  I went 10 for 20.... they were hungry to say the least    I'm sure I could of caught more but after I had reach my limit, decided to pack it in... got the gear put away in the car and I'm just about ready to hit the send button on my phone to text my Mrs to tell her I'm leaving when I notice from the corner of my eye, a couple guys walking on the road coming towards me  Now they were well dressed and not looking like the locals at all They got closer and then I see the badge and the gun in the holster.... knew then it was the CO's... got talking and after a few words back and forth they did the routine check (license, fish in the cooler)and were quite nice about it.....  I was clean   so they went about their business and I left after.... got to say that it was a very long time since I had been checked by CO's and was real happy to see that     It's nice to see that they are doing their job  All in all, drove 3 1/2 hours, fish for 1 hour 1/2 for my limit of pokadots   and finished the bucket of worms I had purchased in April  for opener   I'm a happy camper now  P.S.  Forgot to mention that them boats out on the water... did not see them catch nothing    I bet they were anxious for me to leave so to conquer my honey hole Thanks for reading Until next time! Tight lines Leechman"
594237,mercman,2011-06-18 23:59:00,7054,Thanks for the report Jacques Great day for fishing.  
594246,fishnsled,2011-06-19 00:31:00,3520,Good fishing Jacques. Now where are the dinner plate pics so I can drool some more.

594263,Mike the Pike,2011-06-19 02:00:00,3421,Jacques now a great story like that and no pix.thats not like you and now you probably ate all the evidence.  good thing for those emoticons lol
594271,Mike the Pike,2011-06-19 02:19:00,3421,Oh and BTW Jacques here is a very good chance that cell phone you have has a Camera   so the Texting could be ignored and we could see some pix you know  When I go fishing that phone gets put away and ignored....
594278,Leecher,2011-06-19 02:53:00,7832, Thanks Paul!!!  You bet   Thanks Will!!!  Them beauts are going to be my Mom next little treat... If she invites me over... I'll be sure to take some pics of my vantage point for you   Thanks Terry!!! It certainly was awesome   I know Mike... Sorry man   The evidence... well some of it is frozen and will be my Mom's next little treat   LOL I'm fully aware of the phone capabilities and to tell you the truth.... was not even thinking of it with all the action going on     Wish I had a camera man at hand   want to come up for a day?  I'd be glad and honored to share some shoreline with you
594280,Live2fish85,2011-06-19 03:10:00,1633,Great Report. Sounds like a great day fishing for the time you were there. Hopefully some pictures from your next outing.
594282,Leecher,2011-06-19 03:16:00,7832, Thanks Chris!!!  It sure was   I'll try my best.... promise
594314,Rod Caster,2011-06-19 12:01:00,5784,"Fish first, photos second! haha, good job snapping your cold streak! But, at 11:11 your supposed to think of somebody special, which means you should have texted your wife before the cast. haha.  Congrats on respecting the fishery! The CO's must like running into guys like you. Hopefully the boaters didn't hurt your honey hole."
594340,Leecher,2011-06-19 14:38:00,7832," Thanks Chad!!!  LOL yeah the texting thingy came back to mind after I had boxed the first fish   Actually, I totally forgot about my lunch in the cooler too  Them CO's were friendly and had a good chat with them while they were doing their check.... it's great to see them out there  The boaters were targeting the top of the water column and them beauts were staying deep... that is why I was using slip bobber type rigs and had so much action"
594344,limeyangler,2011-06-19 14:48:00,5204,LOL Jacques...great fishing for sure!  Gotta love when the bite is on.  There must be a different breed of fisherman over there....cuz recently i havde had people on an empty lake scoot right over to me and start fishing within yards....unlike the boaters you mentioned waiting till you leave!  NO PICTURES!!!!!   thats like smoking without inhaling!
594505,corvette1,2011-06-20 04:06:00,1765,awesome trip leech congrats
594596,Leecher,2011-06-20 14:32:00,7832, Thanks Simon!!!  Yeah the nerve of some people I tell ya.... one of the two boats did pass within casting range of me and that was it.... guess he saw me land a couple and wanted to see if he could hook into one trolling  Speaking of smoking.... hows that going for ya??   Thanks Corvy!!!  More like epic awesome
594622,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-20 15:36:00,2690,"Good report Jacques!!  Would love to get out fishing with you some day!  PS---was starting to think that Vince (Vinnimon) was going to take the ""emoticon"" title away from you, but, after reading this one...THE CROWN is still yours"
594649,Leecher,2011-06-20 16:24:00,7832, Thanks Frankie!!!  The feeling is mutual  LOL yeah them emotion thingy are the only way to express yourself in a pictureless fishing report   I think now you have a pretty good idea how I felt
594722,Moosebunk,2011-06-20 19:09:00,3970,Sounds like the perfect 1 1/2 hours to me Jacques.
595067,Leecher,2011-06-21 16:42:00,7832, Thanks Drew!!! It sure was
