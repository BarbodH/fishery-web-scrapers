595160,Jer,2011-06-21 23:18:00,1426,"  I wouldn't let it keep your dog away, Geoff. Moosy had the time of her life, she really did. Next time we'll just be keeping a closer eye on her and denying any requests for giving her any ""treats""."
595163,misfish,2011-06-21 23:23:00,29133," If he did Jer,he would of been smiling ear to ear like me.That was the best of all. 3 helpings for me."
595165,Jer,2011-06-21 23:25:00,1426,"   Problem was, she was smiling from both ends..."
595168,misfish,2011-06-21 23:30:00,29133,"Sorry ,HER.Moosy sounded male.  So, can you tell me why the close connection to our ""her"" cuddles?   2012 cant come soon enough."
595169,irishfield,2011-06-21 23:31:00,26272,I had it covered Brian.. I kept calling her Lucy !
595171,Jer,2011-06-21 23:37:00,1426,   Maybe your dog is a lesbian
595172,aplumma,2011-06-21 23:37:00,6896, The deerfly bite makes sense it is the thinnest place for fur and there is no meat below. I am sorry moosey had issues I am looking forward to her bringing her owners back next year.  Art
595173,Jewelbee,2011-06-21 23:38:00,422,I'm soo glad Moosy is ok! Newt had a great time too. All the dogs did lots of playing! Just have to watch em close around the food.
595174,Jer,2011-06-21 23:40:00,1426,   She get's that alot.
595175,misfish,2011-06-21 23:40:00,29133,  Our dog was running away.
595177,Jewelbee,2011-06-21 23:41:00,422,It was good to see you guys again! Looking forward to next year already!
594423,pikeguy,2011-06-20 01:25:00,195,"Shorty and I had a great time at Lakair. Young or old every one has a good time and make good friends. Not only is this board a great place with great people with lots of info on all sorts of stuff but  to meet these members in person is another thing. It may not have been the biggest G2G but it was something to remember. We enjoyed meeting other members that were not there last year and reuniting with the one's that were there. A big thanks to all that are involved in this G2G and a big thanks to all that came out. Looking forward to next year!!    We did go out fishing, did not catch as much as others (Lex) lol we got 3 pikes during our stay     biggest one measured 34"" gave me a good fight but i still won lol"
594430,GBW,2011-06-20 01:43:00,8460,"nice, glad to read all was well and the fish were found too."
594447,Bly,2011-06-20 02:25:00,1556,"Definitely a good time, great to meet you and Shorty!  Nice pike"
594504,corvette1,2011-06-20 04:02:00,1765,glad you two had a great time i still feel like crap
594511,motv8tr,2011-06-20 06:27:00,2587,"Good to see you guys too, glad you got into some fish, hope to do it again next year...might even stay a while  Maureen"
594517,Jer,2011-06-20 10:12:00,1426,"Sandra, Moosy & I had a blast as well, the only downer was the Friday evening downpour...that and our lack of a decent air matress.  It was great to meet everybody, I think we'll be back next year for sure.  Doug, I hope you're feeling better soon, glad you made it home OK."
594549,TJQ,2011-06-20 12:36:00,7806,"It was great to see you guys again, and THANKS for cleaning up all that pike for the fish fry!!!!"
594553,Spiel,2011-06-20 12:40:00,9065,Was another awesome year! Familiar faces and new it was great to meet and spend time with everyone.  
594852,irishfield,2011-06-21 00:15:00,26272,"Was great hanging out with all involved.. especially Shorty !!!!  Too bad we had at least 3 sick dogs on Sunday. I don't own any of them and I'm pissed about it, can't imagine those involved."
594856,misfish,2011-06-21 00:20:00,29133,"Thanks for the cutting of the supper friend. You did a great job,and nice meeting you all."
594899,Jer,2011-06-21 01:59:00,1426,"  Well Moosy is feeling better today Wayne, back to her old self. It was a multi-stopped ride home though, with one accident in the back of the truck. We'll certainly be keeping a closer eye on what she might eat when there's so many people and food around.  I hope the other pooches are feeling better as well."
594903,Jewelbee,2011-06-21 02:05:00,422,"So sorry to hear this,,,Newt was fine TG! Hope all the others are ok now!!!"
594907,pikeguy,2011-06-21 02:10:00,195,
594953,irishfield,2011-06-21 05:47:00,26272,"  Glad Newt is fine.. thanks to you having her on a leash. From the info I've heard and gathered the damage was intentional and malicious, for the second year in a row.... and should never be tolerated again!"
594956,Jewelbee,2011-06-21 08:35:00,422,WOW!! I had NO idea..How low can someone get??
594961,Handlebarz,2011-06-21 09:38:00,3790,Nice to see everyone having a great time up there that really sucks that some could try and make a dog sick just for there own pleasure. A good milk bone in there ear might help
595094,aplumma,2011-06-21 19:05:00,6896,You can account for any bald spots on Moosey from excess petting from me ... no food was fed to the little girl though.   Art
595111,Rich Clemens,2011-06-21 19:42:00,3131,"Nice to meet you pikeguy.   Met quite a few new board members this year - which I look forward to each year.   Lew's Marv had a pretty rough day the past two days - possible from being over-heated.  Glad to report that he's up and around again and back to normal - keeping his bones away from Digger.  In a way, I guess we're a little glad we didn;t bring our two along this time."
595115,LeXXington,2011-06-21 19:48:00,1928," LOL, 4 people on the boat casting every direction your much more likly to find fish they can't escape  Great to see you and Shorty again. See you next year"
595127,Jer,2011-06-21 20:49:00,1426,"   No worries, Art, I know you wouldn't have fed her anything.  Funny that you mention bald spots though, Moosy just came home from the vet with the top of her head shaved, she developed some serious ""hot spots"" on her scalp the last couple of days. You gotta wash off the Cajun spices from your fingers before mauling the dogs, lol. Actually, the vet figgers excessive wet head syndrome (imagine that), the heat and possibly some nasty deer fly bites."
595133,misfish,2011-06-21 21:25:00,29133," That might be my fault. I gave Joe an extra piece of the jerk chicken,and he passed it off to Art. Me bad.   Think Joe got the better of the trade. Thanks bud,didnt have to.   Cant believe what I read about the dogs. Thats just Bull.  Our cuddles never leaves Bettys or my side,or if she dose,not to far out of eye sight.. THANK GOODNESS.  Good to hear Jer alls good. And the rest aswell."
595138,GBW,2011-06-21 21:39:00,8460,"as a dog owner and lover (easy now folks, not in that way) I'll be keeping mine at home then if I can ever make one of these.  I'm rather   to read/see there was intent to harm the dogs.  that's just not cool in any way shape or form."
595142,pikeguy,2011-06-21 21:54:00,195,Hey every one it was no problem in cleaning the fish. But lets not forget that i was not alone in that. Thanks Jon for helping out with cleaning all tho's fish greatly appreciated  Hope to see you next year.
595151,spinnerbaitking,2011-06-21 22:40:00,1622,"This sounds like fun maybe there is some one on the board that wants to go next year split on a Cabin, Fuel & Food, I have 2 Boats, 14"" Aluminum & a 16' Skeeter both with Trolling Motors & Pedestal Seats, I'm not into heavy Drinking but would put Hours & Hours on the water, lets talk if Interested SBK"
595159,Jer,2011-06-21 23:14:00,1426,"  I sincerely hope this wasn't the case, Wayne, but rather a case of mis-guided affection. Besides, I did catch Moosy gnoshing away in TJ's firepit after the fish fry, probably got a helping of Art's red beans & rice..."
