594538,LucG,2011-06-20 12:11:00,779,"Got a chance to bring out my dad fishing for fathers day. We ended up having a very well outing. I also managed to catch two PB!  We did run into a couple of idiots on sea-doos, purposly clipping by us at full speed. I would go on about them, but I won't...  27.5""   "
594541,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 12:13:00,4661,How big were they???
594550,LucG,2011-06-20 12:36:00,779,"Walleye was 27.5"", must have been at least 7 lbs. Didnt measure or weight the sheaphead."
594566,Rod Caster,2011-06-20 13:26:00,5784,!! Nice. Can I borrow that walleye for the OFC tourney?  Those drum fight like a bat out of hell don't they?
594569,LucG,2011-06-20 13:32:00,779," Haha, I was a little upset that I forgot my OFC Tourny Sheet in the truck. Allthough I think we allready have one that beats it...  Yeah, I love fighting those things on light action rods. They were hot too, must have caught well over 10 of them..."
594578,Leecher,2011-06-20 14:00:00,7832,Nice going LucG     Congrats on your PB's Leechman

594624,Jen,2011-06-20 15:43:00,833,Great post and nice fish! Bet your dad enjoyed his Fathers day!
594656,LucG,2011-06-20 16:35:00,779," I though the same thing, last week I had caught a 25"" walleye on talon, and it looked really aged, pale, scars, bad eye...  This one looked really healthy for its age."
594657,alphaalpha,2011-06-20 16:40:00,475,congrats on some PB's!  -AA
594666,Roy,2011-06-20 17:05:00,13728,"Good Job, Luc. That's one handsome looking eye there. That sheepie must have bulldogged big time."
594667,EC1,2011-06-20 17:07:00,930,Awesome fish! Congrats!
594717,Moosebunk,2011-06-20 18:57:00,3970,Spotless and solid PB eye.  Congrats.
594745,soggey,2011-06-20 20:18:00,20,"Beauty walleye, nice chunky fish."
594762,Rizzo,2011-06-20 20:44:00,4754,"once hooked a big sheephead like that on nipissing on a 9 inch 5 ounce nitro glider bait. Thing hit (and fought) like a freight train. Pretty embarrassing though when you think you've got a nice musky, tell your partner to get the net ready and you pull up that ugly mug! Anyways, congrats on the 2 pb's"
