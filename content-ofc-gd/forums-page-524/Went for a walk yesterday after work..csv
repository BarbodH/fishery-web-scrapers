593828,muskymike,2011-06-16 23:33:00,772,"Wait, you went for a walk, beat up and stole some kid who was fishings camera and posted it stating it was you Bill?  Kidding. Very nice sir!"
593848,BillM,2011-06-17 00:49:00,17367, LOL!!!   Now I just need some pics of some GBay ski's!!!!!!
593849,Grimace,2011-06-17 00:53:00,2020,What a good looking specimen.  The Brown Trout is a handsome fish to say the least.
593871,muskymike,2011-06-17 01:57:00,772, I wonder where you could get some of those
593873,BillM,2011-06-17 02:05:00,17367," I dunno man, we should probably go out and try   You catch them, I'll take the pics  :)"
594248,Moosebunk,2011-06-19 00:44:00,3970,"Beauty fish and shots Bill.  Worth the stop for fish like that, everyday man!"
594442,muskymike,2011-06-20 02:16:00,772, Im in Bill. Just gotta get back that way. I am stuck out in the Ottawa area for a few years.
594445,Lionized,2011-06-20 02:23:00,19,"Great to see, gorgeous fish!...some motivation for tomorrow!!  Can u pass along weather the river flows to Simcoe or G-bay? 	: )"
594456,BillM,2011-06-20 02:34:00,17367, Neither
594759,JTorra,2011-06-20 20:41:00,50,Hey bud...nice fish! Think the 798 SI Combo would have picked that one up?
593469,BillM,2011-06-15 22:35:00,17367,"Decided to pack the gear into the car before work yesterday and stop at one of my fav places on the way home.  Weather was awesome, no bugs in sight (sans those hatching) and only a tad bit of wind.  I have been told by a good friend that if you wanna catch big fish, you gotta use big bait.  The upside of this is that usually if there is a monster hanging around, he'll make the effort to smash that 5inch streamer.  Downside is that you won't get any of those 10-12inch piddlers that usually is a nice break in the action.   I didn't hit the river at a very good time (4pm) but I thought I'd make the most of it.   One thing I've learned is that big browns don't occupy the same space as big stealhead, so you gotta learn how to read the water differently.  The places I've caught nice browns, I would have never fished if I was going after steelhead.  There is definitely a learning curve, even more so on pressured fish like these.  It was nice to put all those tactics together and have it pay off.  Not a monster by any means, but a nice fish for this system..   "

593753,BillM,2011-06-16 17:55:00,17367,"For sure man, I've been actually thinking about it quite a bit.  I'm sure the hatches are going crazy down there with all this warm weather.  We'll have to hook up in the very near future."
593770,wallacio,2011-06-16 19:09:00,475,Great fish buddy.   Sorry I had to bail on you that night.  BTW nice fly!  It looks familiar!!!
