594385,commie,2011-06-19 22:28:00,29,I am looking for a guides for Bass or Walleye fishing around the Kawathra's or anywhere near 1-2 years from GTA.  This would be 2-3 people.  Any recommendations?
594389,Terry,2011-06-19 23:01:00,14456,I think the best around the Kawarthas is Greg Klatt http://www.profishntanglingservices.com/

594410,NAC,2011-06-20 00:35:00,369,Greg is good and Jimmy Dodds near Rice Lake is a real good one too.
594425,HTHM,2011-06-20 01:31:00,4082,Send Garry2Rs a PM he should be able to help you.
594628,danz,2011-06-20 15:47:00,15,"Garry 2Rs  website http://www.muskystriker.com/let'sgofishing/  great guy to fishing with, very knowledgeable on everything and a great story teller. You will have a fun day for sure"
594641,Harrison,2011-06-20 16:05:00,2202,It's pretty tough to beat Grag Klatt or Jimmy Dodd on pressured waters in the Kawarthas if Bass and Walleye are your deal.
594664,GoneFishin,2011-06-20 17:01:00,349,"Talk to Garry2Rs from this board. He's a great guy, very knowledgeable and experienced on the kawarthas. I'm sure he will be able to set you up. My girlfriend and I had an awesome day on the water with him last year."
594865,irishfield,2011-06-21 00:47:00,26272,I'd go with Harrison myself....
595313,Harrison,2011-06-22 13:39:00,2202," Shucks..  I seriously miss guiding around here, going from over 200 days a year on the water to maybe 25 sucks.  But the trade off of time with my lil girls is more then worth it.  I'd make the same decision again.  Who knows what this future will bring.  In all seriousness Wayne and others, I'd love to get out with some folks here.  I have the water and gear, just nothing for us to ride in.  Supply that I'll supply the rest and wicked sandweeches.
