593850,jeffw,2011-06-17 00:55:00,267,I picked up 2 quantum energypt rods at lebarons for just over $50 and in my opinion are much better rods than the compres. They are last years models and only have a few left instock last time I was there. Cheers jeff
593936,ryansusanna,2011-06-17 13:34:00,27,"I think it depends on what you want to use the rods for.  Crucials are great in certain applications, and not so much in others (in my opinion).  If you live close to either Fishing World, Pro J's, or Paddle Tails i would strongly recommend checking out a Dobyn's Rod.  They are new to Canada, have the Savvy Line of rods close to your price range, and have a rod demo program.  (i.e. take the rod home, and try it.  i think they are also doing a draw for a Ranger Z521 with a 250 Evinrude for everyone that demo's a rod in 2011)."
593946,scugpg,2011-06-17 14:10:00,1373,I think the Compre or a Quantum PT Tour ($120ish) would be a good choice. Other than that the St. Croix Avid at $160 but you're getting up there. I agree I'm not a big fan of the lower non-USA made St Croix's there is definitely a feel (and looks) difference.
593951,Roy,2011-06-17 14:28:00,13728,"I still like the Compres. I have 4 as it is and as soon as they're phased out later this year, I'll probably pick up another 4 just to have because. Nowadays my goto rods are all Spiel rods."
593955,Dan668,2011-06-17 14:36:00,1120,dobyns savvy and powell rods can be had for just over 100 if you look around. If you dont want to pay more the compre is good.
593991,Stoty,2011-06-17 18:09:00,2910,"Big Bear custom rods are amazing! They're handles are cutting edge! I own a couple of them, and absolutely love them.  Check out Big Bear's website (www.bigbearfishingrods.com) or TackleStock.com for more info."
593993,grimsbylander,2011-06-17 18:28:00,3016,"  Last year I was rod shopping and got talked into spending an extra $20 from the rod I was looking at to a Compre...just for the warranty. Well, my son ""shortened"" it by 6"" this spring hacking around through the trees at 40 creek. Got it replaced no questions asked...and no, he can't use it now!  Dave"
593996,Weeds,2011-06-17 18:49:00,782,"There are always a ton of good rods in the classified section. If you've got 100 bucks to spend on a rod, once you take taxes into account; you are getting a 90 dollar rod at best. Or you could buy a sweet used stick worth 200.  How much is a compre anyway, once you add in taxes? Maybe 130, 140? Hardly qualifies as being in a 100 dollar class bracket."
593998,GBW,2011-06-17 19:09:00,8460,my question back is what are you going to use said rod for?  that will help with the replies you get.
593999,cynmar,2011-06-17 19:15:00,169,"Unlike everyone else, I know very little about the make up of the rods. All I know is I took my Citica into BPS and tried it with St . Croix Mojo Bass, Crucial, Daiwa, a couple other St Croix, an E21, and I finally ended up with a 7'6"" BPS Cranking Stick. It just felt the best in my hand, had the tip action I liked and the cork handle I liked. Some power hump thing they call it but it just felt good. Supposedly IM6 graphite which I know is not the best but hell , I fish only for enjoyment not professional and again, the rod and reel felt good together.  Bill"
594003,GBW,2011-06-17 19:17:00,8460,This answer right here is why I asked what I did above.  I too have that BPS rod and like it a lot.
594494,Banger68,2011-06-20 03:25:00,157," I picked up two Compre this year, One was $100 incl taxes at the London Boat Show and the other was $110 incl taxes at a sale in Hamilton. Plus they have the rebate.  Like them so far, but only fished them a couple times."
594519,singingdog,2011-06-20 10:25:00,1047,I don't think there's any comparison between the mojos and the compres....compres are hands-down a nicer rod IMHO.
594521,Jer,2011-06-20 10:47:00,1426,"You shoulda gone to Lakair. I scored a Spiel custom light action spinning rod, all for $20 worth of raffle tickets..."
594522,Roy,2011-06-20 11:06:00,13728,Congrats to you Jer. You'll be happy with it. Chris does fine work.
594523,Jer,2011-06-20 11:18:00,1426,"I'm hoping to get out tonight to give it a try, though eventually I may need a nice shiny new reel to go with it...  Looks like a mighty fine rod, it was the highlight of my weekend..."
594524,Roy,2011-06-20 11:20:00,13728,A small Stradic and you're good to go.
594991,Jer,2011-06-21 12:50:00,1426,"I may have to settle for a Symmetre, I priced out a new Stradic 1500 at $185, the Symmetre is only $115. $70 buys a lot of baits.  I have both in the 2500 series now (albeit older models) and actually prefer the Symmetre."
594992,Roy,2011-06-21 12:56:00,13728,"There is such an animal as a 1500 Symetre, Jer? Even the Sahara is a decent reel."
594998,Jer,2011-06-21 13:09:00,1426,"I just checked the Le Baron web-site (someone please recommend a new webmaster to them, please) and you're right. They used to make a 1500 series.  The 1000 series might be just right as well."
595014,Roy,2011-06-21 13:41:00,13728,"Jer, the Le Baron site is a work of art compared to the S.A.I.L. site."
595044,gotfish,2011-06-21 15:12:00,53,I have given Simax a try last year and was very impressed. Great warranty and in the $100 +- range. Pro J in Scarborough carry a good selection.
595121,archie_james_c,2011-06-21 20:10:00,618,"I'd honestly wait for some nice used sticks to pop up on eBay or here, also go on walleye central.com and put a wanted ad in their classifieds, the dudes on there have top of the line gear and let it go cheap sometimes"
593026,Lunker777,2011-06-14 18:05:00,866,"Hey everyone  I am in the market for a couple new rods and I have been REALLY looking into the MOJO series....but before I pull the trigger, I want to hear some input from the OFC community.  I know its a loaded question.... but compared to the MOJO series... is there anything else in this price point that I should be considering ???  The rods will be paired with Curados.  Thanks"
593031,Gregoire,2011-06-14 18:26:00,1397,I would say compre...I was looking at a few earlier in the year and they had a few nice split grip rods with an exposed blank...I decided to go a bit pricier with an avid instead. I still lust after a cumara though.
593035,bigmac1984,2011-06-14 18:41:00,193,"X2 for compre....  I have mojo's also and like them, but the Shimano warranty can't really be beat. I had a mojo break on me last year and they have just a 5 year warranty, shimano compre has lifetime. It cost me almost $40 to ship the mojo to the USA to get it replaced. I've since switched to using Shimano Crucials (1 above the compre) and love them.  I think you'll get alot of opinions on here."
593036,Fang,2011-06-14 18:41:00,1330,"My votes go for the Mojo and BPS Extreme. I have several Extremes purchased when they went on sale for $69 and have never felt the need to go out and replace these. Have both trigger and spinning and they perform flawlessly beside more expensive St Croix, Fenwicks and Diawa's. Last year I picked up 2 of the Mojo's to replace some older Team Diawa finesse rods (try and find these if you can) that were finally beat down and could not come back to life. The 6'8 Mojo drop shot is a really nice rod.  Another light to medium series I like for similar money is the St Croix Premier"
593053,Live2fish85,2011-06-14 19:25:00,1633,I own 2 St. Croix Mojo Bass rods. I have the whacky and frog n slop they are both amazing rods I can say that between my shimano rod and st. criox hands down st.croix. You can't beat it for the price.
593054,baal,2011-06-14 19:27:00,16,I would recommand:  1) Bass Pro Johnny Morris Signature Series II 2) Bass Pro Carbon Lite 3) Bass Pro Johnny Morris Carbon Black
593060,Colin Marshall,2011-06-14 19:34:00,66," Hi,  I use the Shimano Crucial and find it an excellent rod, its well balanced and a pleasure to use, coupled with the Shimano warranty I think you'll find it hard to beat."
593069,Joeytier,2011-06-14 20:19:00,3990,Take a look at the Rapala R-Types as well...
593078,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-14 20:37:00,4399,"If somebody knows where Crucial`s are selling for a 100 bucks please do tell!!!  I have a mojo looks like a decent rod for the money, still haven`t used it though so I don`t know how it fishes. I have several Compre`s and I have been happy with them and you can`t beat Shimano`s warranty and customer service!"
593079,bigmac1984,2011-06-14 20:40:00,193,"I bought 4 off kijiji this past winter all for $100-$130, crucials that is."
593082,baal,2011-06-14 20:49:00,16,"People told me to start with AVID if I trun to St. Croix. Mojo Bass is a decent rod given the pricing. However, my friend told me the material of Mojo is not that good. However, thinking about the price difference, $100 vs. $200+, I would go for:  1) Mojo 2) BPS CarbonLite 3) BPS JM Signature Series II"
593088,PikeMolester,2011-06-14 21:04:00,428,Compre. Thats it
593093,Bassaholic,2011-06-14 21:39:00,74,Posted this awhile ago...The current line of Crucials and Compres are being discontinued. A new design for both models should be released at ICAST in July. So before you buy the old models you might want to wait and check out the new ones. But if you need them now then I know one online store has Crucials on sale for $138 plus they're having a 20% off sale for fathers day...
593130,Dutch,2011-06-14 23:00:00,831,"Look for used stuff on Kijiji, here and BFB.  There's a brand new Crucial on BFB right now for $100 if you are looking for a bass rod.  Lots of quality stuff out there for decent prices.  I got 2 Compres, a St. Croix and a custom rod with wooden reel seat and butt for a total of $120.  New the rods would have been minimum of $500.  March/April or Nov./Dec. is the best time to get them cheap, as we get closer to bass season, prices go up."
593149,GoneFishin,2011-06-14 23:52:00,349,"I bought a couple rods at the $100 dollar mark and hated them. I have a couple mojo's and I still don't see how any one could say they are a nice rod.. Compre's go for about $120 and the difference feels like a $100 price jump over the mojo's, and even if they were the same blank, for a couple mores bucks your good for life with shimano's warranty. I haven't tried every -$100 rod out there, but I do know I have wasted money buying to cheap. So unless you know some one with a lower end rod you can try out before buying, I'd stick with compre+."
593177,landry,2011-06-15 01:19:00,1005, Yes - but it is way over 100 bucks.
593180,danc,2011-06-15 01:24:00,4677,"I'm pretty much hooked on Cabelas Fish Eagle II rods. I've been using them exclusively for a decade now. Top quality componants for a song. High-quality CX2, 38 million modulus IM6 blanks equipped with Portuguese cork handles, Fuji Hardloy guides. $80.00 each for a wide range of products from spinning, casting and they even have a Steelhead line. The best thing is that I've used $300.00 and $400.00 rods and I prefer the Fish Eagle over them. If you break a rod, it's better to be out 80 bucks than 3 or 4 hundred. Check them out on Cabelas site. Read the reviews. You'll see lots of comments like mine. They went on sale early in the year for half price. I bought 4 more. Yes. I'm using $40.00 rods at this point in time. With money not being much of an issue, I wouldn't trade them for anything."
593181,solopaddler,2011-06-15 01:31:00,8605,"  I agree with what you're saying Dan, they're decent rods.  But 38 million modulus is far from a top quality blank."
593184,danc,2011-06-15 01:44:00,4677," I don't have a clue what that means Mike. I just fish with them. And I like them obviously. Besides a bunch of numbers, tell me what I'm missing out on? I've owned several Loomis and top of the line Cabelas rods. But I much prefer the Fish Eagle II."
593185,solopaddler,2011-06-15 01:46:00,8605,  I'm not going to even go there Dan. Seems to me you're not missing out on anything.
593187,irishfield,2011-06-15 01:53:00,26272,He seems to be doing it right Mike... the bugger even trolls with them tip forward and doesn't break them! (unless of course that's why he ordered 4 more   )  
593190,danc,2011-06-15 02:15:00,4677," Ha! First time I've seen that shot Wayne. Love it. Always tip forward for me so I can see what's going on with the business end of the rod when I'm navigating. Occasionally I have a problem getting the rod out of the holder though when a decent fish hits. My minimum 8' length rod helps with that. And yes, I broke two rods in Red Lake last summer. One was stepped on and the other somehow broke when a buddy was throwing a gang hook on a rope off of our dock looking for lawn chairs. But I'm all rodded up and good to go again this year."
593220,pomoxis,2011-06-15 03:13:00,10,"The Abu Garcia rods in the Vendetta, Veritas, and Verdict are all worth considering. Really nice feel to them, and great price point. Veritas and Verdict rods come with SiC guide inserts too."
593223,danc,2011-06-15 03:20:00,4677," Yea, but how many million modulus are they?"
593224,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-15 03:25:00,4399,  Is that modulus`s or moduli?
