595002,rbaquial,2011-06-21 13:13:00,968,"Hey Folks,  I am going to be heading up to Tobermory for a week for some Camping and Fishing (near Cyprus Lake). I was just wondering if anyone else knew of any other shore fishing spots in the area?  The only spot I know of right now is the ""dock""ish kind of area by Bay St. (See Link) right in Tobermory.  <iframe width=""425"" height=""350"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" marginheight=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" src=""http://maps.google.ca/maps?saddr=45.257247,-81.661828&hl=en&sll=45.255646,-81.66245&sspn=0.01148,0.01929&mra=dme&mrsp=0&sz=16&t=h&ie=UTF8&ll=45.255646,-81.66245&spn=0.01148,0.01929&output=embed""></iframe><br /><small><a href=""http://maps.google.ca/maps?saddr=45.257247,-81.661828&hl=en&sll=45.255646,-81.66245&sspn=0.01148,0.01929&mra=dme&mrsp=0&sz=16&t=h&ie=UTF8&ll=45.255646,-81.66245&spn=0.01148,0.01929&source=embed"" style=""color:#0000FF;text-align:left"">View Larger Map</a></small>  Does anyone else know of other places I could try? I'm not looking for any ""Secret"" spots or anything - just a spot I can fish off of from shore. I don't have access to a Canoe/boat.  Send me a PM if you wish.  Thank you in Advance, Rob (A2F)"
595048,nexstar,2011-06-21 15:32:00,63,not sure about shore fishing but i rented a boat from cedar grove http://www.cedargrovecottages.com/ to fish cameron lake and caught smallmouth bass and walleyes. I was told you will catch rainbow and salmon at the tobermory harbour in the fall but not sure what you will catch in the summer. Good Luck.
