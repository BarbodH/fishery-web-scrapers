594369,Handlebarz,2011-06-19 18:11:00,3790,"First I must say thanks to Ron AKA Djeep as he was over here picking up some lures a few weeks ago and took a liking to one of my old buck tail Spinner baits and with talking to him that night it lit a fire under my arse to get working on the Egg Heads again.  When I started making these a couple years ago they were to be used for open water casting or on weed edges that is why I am using a treble hook they are heavier then most others out on the market, with the smaller ones about 3.4oz and the larger ones 4.4oz this way you can fish them deep and have them stay down there. They dont kill your back to fish them either.  They are made with .062 wire 5/0 VMC hook that is shrink tubed just like my In-line's so that you can change the hook if you have to cut it out and not ruin the bait, they ahve a magnum 10 blade and two large musky sized flashabou skirts.  These are a couple that I have already done but you can get them in any color skirt and blade I offer the Double 10 Handlebarz In-line lures. The heads can only be painted in the colors I have shown as that is all I have for now in paint.  Hope you all like them Cheers Mike  The first four are the smaller 3.4oz baits White Tiger    Squid   Fire Tiger   Nitro   This one is 4.4oz Electric Black orange/black blade "
594370,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-19 18:13:00,2690,"They all rock, Mike!  However, the black and orange and the white tiger might just have to find a place in my tackle box"
594372,Terry,2011-06-19 18:21:00,14456,they look great  you should put a loonie or something in the picture so we can get a sense of what size they are
594378,misfish,2011-06-19 19:02:00,29133,"Out with Lew Saturday morning Mike for a fish, and you make great baits.  Those look great aswell."
594386,SlowPoke,2011-06-19 22:33:00,2984,"Oh for pete's sake, now I have to fill out a new order form."
594403,Slop,2011-06-20 00:01:00,151,Those are some fantastic creations. I'd love to put them through some serious testing ....but I'm on a float plane Friday morning.
594412,Handlebarz,2011-06-20 00:46:00,3790,Thanks guys  Frank we can get them to ya that is not a problem as you already know and if I had them ready for sale I would have let you know a bit ago.  Terry I had not thought about that and yes it would be good to show the difference in the head sizes and the total size of the lures if we get sun tomorrow I will try and do some pics.  Thanks Brian I hope you guys get into some fish this week I don't know if Lew had any of the double 10's yet if not Wayne has some to show ya.  Slowpoke if you would stick around Ontario we could get out and test some of these things out but you had some other stuff like work getting in the way of your fun times. What are you doing tomorrow??? I am off for the day.   Slop thanks a lot if there was not postal strike I would have no problem sending them tomorrow and know they would be there before Wednesday but who knows right now.  I have had a few ask me about single hooks on them and yes I have single hooks and can build them with them instead of the treble hook that is not a problem at all.
594466,SlowPoke,2011-06-20 02:46:00,2984,"Yeah... work work work. As far as I know, I won't be heading to Moncton until tomorrow night but I have a lot of homework to do on the computer. I might have to go the long legal road to get paid up from the last employer. My wife picked up 4 more cheques for me on Thursday and they still owe me a bundle. If I have to do all this homework, I'm going to nail 'em for every penny.  I can't wait to try them Egg Heads.... and all my other muskie gear LOL"
594477,Bly,2011-06-20 03:06:00,1556,Gorgeous Mike.  Had the chance to see a few of your baits up close this past weekend...impressive.  I will be searching your catalogue :-)
594478,Handlebarz,2011-06-20 03:07:00,3790,Brian keep after them we just won our case against our last employer and they are paying dearly it sure does pay to go after them. I hope you get your cash out of them I know it was a rough time there. We will get out and do some casting and see how we can do. I think a fall trip is in order again this year
