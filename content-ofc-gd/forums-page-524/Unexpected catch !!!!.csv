We were fishing in about 8-10 ft of water, looking for some Northerns and ended up with their BIG cousin !!!!!  Never measured or weighed the girl, but Im guessing between 40-45 inches and we figured it was over 30 lbs. It was HEAVY !!!!!!!!      She took about 5 minutes to get her breath back, but swam away good and strong !  I noticed she left me a nice surprise on the boat.......     This is why I love fishing !!!!"
592580,ADB,2011-06-13 18:47:00,444,Can't go wrong with a surprise 'ski!  Were you using heavy tackle for the pike?
592581,NAW,2011-06-13 18:49:00,4022,A little ski-poo on the carpet eh!!  You'll have to get out the steam cleaner
592584,Lunkerhunter,2011-06-13 19:09:00,455,"beauty fish man! i dont think she is pushing 30 lbs at that length but 20 is probably a better estimate.  i dont want to take anything away from your fish because it is a beautiful muskie, no matter the weight you should be pumped!!  cheers dude"

592921,SmokestackLightnin,2011-06-14 12:24:00,390," Those aren't capri pants you're wearing are they? If they are, I don't care how big the muskie was, turn in your man card and your fishing license.  J/K - Nice Fish!!"
