595390,adempsey,2011-06-22 16:10:00,1498,"As per the 2011 MNR Fishing Regulations for Ontario:   Hooks and Lines – An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes (see exceptions to the general regulations) and for ice fishing in many areas (see Ice Fishing, page 11). A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached.  Hook – A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that are part of a lure."

An angler is restricted to the use of only one line while fishing during the open water season. Two lines are allowed while fishing from a boat on the open waters of the Great Lakes (Note: There are exceptions in some designated areas). The provincial standard allows the use of two closely attended lines while ice fishing.
