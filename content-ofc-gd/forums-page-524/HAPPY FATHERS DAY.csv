594300,mike rousseau,2011-06-19 11:10:00,4661,That's me!  My little boy is only 5 weeks old and it feels pretty cool to be a father on fathers day... And he (the wife) even got me a nice card...  Can't wait for annual fathers day fishing trips with the little bugger...
594330,Live2fish85,2011-06-19 13:16:00,1633,This is my second fathers day and after we see the wifes dad we are going to my parents and I am going to bring the daughter fishin for some perch. She knows how to reel lol so we will see it's just for fun though nice gift to me though.
594336,Mike01,2011-06-19 14:16:00,378,I have a 5 year old and 3 year old and a new little guy who's only 6 weeks old.  We are all heading out in the boat today for a panfish bonanza and after the kids are satisfied hopefully we can get me a new PB laker(the lake has a 1 week lake trout season).

594755,JTorra,2011-06-20 20:36:00,50,7 week old daughter.  8 month old boat that has been on the water twice.  Keep trying to blame it on her but the math doesn't work.
