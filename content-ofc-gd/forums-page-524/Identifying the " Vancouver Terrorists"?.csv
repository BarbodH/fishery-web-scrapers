Im a fair guy equal opportunity parent you know where the wood shed is just let me know when"
594725,Pikeslayer,2011-06-20 19:22:00,1443,"When I was the Town Sherrif (in the 19th century), the kids were a lot more respectful. If they weren't, sometimes they got shot at. That's just the way it was.  Slayer"
594746,Big Cliff,2011-06-20 20:18:00,6899," And I aplaude you for that! I too was lucky enough to raise a son and daughter that respect and appreciate others but I also know some  people, that despite their efforts  weren't so lucky.  One family had a 15 year old daughter that no matter what they tried was a rebel. She she would stay out all night parting with her friends. Parents tried locking the door, kid called the cops, cops came and made them open the door and let her in.  She stole the keys to the family car and went for a joy ride. The parents called the cops. The cops were going to charge the parents for leaving the keys where the kid could find them. (they were in her mothers purse in her parents bedroom)  Then the kid accused the mother of assaulting her, the mother got hauled away in handcuffs and it took several months and many people testifing on her behalf and a lot of money in legal fees before the charges were dropped.  What happened to the kid, NOTHING! Today she lives in her own apartment (a good portion of which the parents are forced to pay for) she parties with her friends almost every night and her parents can't say or do a thing about it.  This is just one example, man I can give you so many more!  I have done quite a bit of work with troubled kids over the years and in most cases the parents had been forced by the system to give up. They had no controle and every time they tried to take control, our ""system"" made them the villen.  So, just because your kids, my kids, and many other kids turned out to be good, doesn't mean that other parents haven't tried.  We've been lucky! If the first time you had offered to take your kid to the wood shead, you'd ended up in handcuffs, had your kids taken away from you, had to spend all your savings on legal bills, lost your job because you were in jail fighting bogus charges, you might have a little empethy!"
594964,singingdog,2011-06-21 10:07:00,1047," No thanks. I prefer to blame the kid who stuffs a rag into a gas tank and attempts to set it on fire. ""Blame the system"" is just another dodge for kids that don't see the line between a good time and criminal, dangerous, anti-social behaviour."
594974,kickingfrog,2011-06-21 11:23:00,8333,"Imagine someone having morels and ethics because it is the right way to do things, and not because they fear punishment from their god."
594988,Cookslav,2011-06-21 12:43:00,1457," I don't think lack of, or sound catholic morals had anything to do with a misguided youth trying to torch a police cruiser. If you want the lords prayer in class then go to a catholic school which is what I did, and where My Kids go. My Taxes are directed to the Seperate board cause I think its important and its My choice, My money, My upbringing....end of story.  Back to the topic, I think this kid deserves to be crimanally charged to the full extent of the law as anyone else would be. And he should pray....errr....hope like heck that the school has a soft spot. I hope for his sake that he has a long track record of good grades, charitable/community service and some luck on his side to show this is an isolated incident... If he does the school may overlook the criminal charges and allow him a shot. But if he's hell on wheels outside of this occurance, he's in for some justice served cold."
595049,Lunker777,2011-06-21 15:37:00,866, Perhaps read the caption with the photo. The couple were roughed up by police and the bf was on the ground taking care of his gf.
595057,Terry,2011-06-21 16:05:00,14456,when the photo first came out and was on tv they did not say that so I went by what I saw...   hind sight is a wonderful thing.......... but is always too late to take it back
595059,Lunker777,2011-06-21 16:15:00,866,Oh... I thought you read the post. It also explains it there.
595063,Terry,2011-06-21 16:28:00,14456,"ok now you made me go back and see what I really did........LOL  the guy before me said Good thing she is wearing underwear.  and I replied ""her mother is proud of her for that""  as it turned out ..I really wasn't commenting on the photo, but what someone said about the photo"

594162,glen,2011-06-18 14:18:00,2641,What a great reason to riot.   Maybe they should have gone fishing.

594176,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-18 15:41:00,0, apparently the problem with the kid becomes apparent.
594177,GBW,2011-06-18 15:49:00,8460,he's got to be praying his cell-mate is a taker and got a giver...
594179,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-18 15:59:00,0,"at 17, as a young offender, isn't it illegal to post his name and picture and such?"
594188,Grimace,2011-06-18 16:59:00,2020,"What a dummy.  I hope justice is served, however I do find it a bit odd when people find satisfaction in the idea of a person being the victim of anal rape in prison.  Almost like it is part of the just punishment.  Odd.  I personally have never thought of anal rape as a sound punishment for any crime.  What a strange dynamic of humanity.  Anyways, I hope they get what they deserve and I hope the salvageable ones learn their lesson."

594194,ehg,2011-06-18 17:29:00,2666,The majority of these rioters were young middle class males with some punks thrown in. People said they were trapped by police and pushed into the riotous crowd by them. Sort of G20 type police tactics caught a lot of people and pushed them into crowd. Saw a couple on television mentioning how they were pushed and beaten by police when they were trying to leave area in fear. A video showed them being roughed up by police but the picture of after when the male tried to comfort scared and still on ground gf became famous.   Lots of misunderstanding going on.  No doubt male youth were taking advantage of the situation.
594200,crossover,2011-06-18 18:13:00,172,"Did you see the neighborhood and big house he lives in? Yeah, a white suburbanite definitely has lots to riot about."

He has not been charged by the police and the police did not release his name so there is no violation of the Young Offenders Act. These damn social media sites, be careful kids they may come back and bite you some time."
594217,Big Cliff,2011-06-18 21:05:00,6899,"I'm sorry guys, teenagers do stupid things sometimes, I know I pulled a few when I was a kid and it was only luck that I didn't end up in trouble or dead. This kid did something really stupid, and while I agree he should be punished for what he did, I don't think it fitting that the rest of his life be ruined for it.  As for blaiming his parents: If you have ever tried to raise a teenager you'll know that you have next to no control over them. Hit them, you go to jail. You can't even yell at them, that is verbal abuse.  If you want to blame someone, blame the system that has taken ""Failed"" out of our schools. Blame the system that suspends two kids because they tried to settle a dispute with a good old fassion punching match. Blame the system that took the lords prayer, our national anthem, and teachers control out of our schools. Sure some of these kids make stupid mistakes and decisions. That is why they are called ""kids"" not adults!  Punish the kid; YES, crusify him; NO!"
594219,Whitespinnerbait,2011-06-18 21:27:00,2038,"  I'll go with Blaming the Kid.............As for crucifying the kid ......yep , sounds good to me !!"

594258,kickingfrog,2011-06-19 01:34:00,8333," Wonder what dear old dad thinks of the video of his son trying to light the rag in the gas tank, and when that doesn't work, he takes the flaming rag and throws it into the cop car.  Having said that, I know there were times that my father defended me to the very end outside of our house  , but he kicked my butt inside of it  .  Though it was nothing like attempting to set fire to a cop car"
594289,Dutchy,2011-06-19 06:07:00,416," Sorry Cliff, I respectfully don't agree with you. This kid is in a private school in Vancouver, comes from a very well-to-do family and he has had opportunities that most kids never get. He made a decision that night to set fire to a police car, that is not stupidity, its a complete lack of respect for everything and he only acts contrite now because he got caught. These people didn't care that they were being filmed and photographed. He deserves all he gets. He was given a start in life and opportunities that set him up for a very successful life and he still chose to behave in this disgusting manner. Tens of thousands of other people walked away, he chose to stay and participate. Its his fault, certainly not his parents. I do agree something is going very wrong with children nowadays, they think they can do what they want without consequences. Even more reason to make an example of this idiot. People do make stupid mistakes, but setting fire to a police car does not fall into that category, its way beyond that."
594298,Rob,2011-06-19 11:02:00,467," Children behaviors (and I still say he is a child as he is under 18) are generally reflected from their up bringing. I have always raised my girls to be respectful and polite, and to always treat others property better than you would treat your own. Just because his father was a well educated surgeon, does not mean he was a good parent. Respect is taught, and what that picture shows is complete disrespect for others property. Kids will always push the limits to see what they can get away with, we need to be the parents and adults and set those limits so that we don't end up with situations like what happened on Wednesday. We have all made mistakes and life, but I have never intentionally gone out of my way to make the lives of others miserable and costly.  Rob C"
