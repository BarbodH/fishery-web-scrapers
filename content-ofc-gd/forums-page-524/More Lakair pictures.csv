This was Sydney's first time at Lakair and although we were only there a short time, she had a terrific time and is already asking if she can go next year and making plans lol  She especially enjoyed all the ""puppies"". Was great to be back, see friends and make new ones.  I did not take as many pictures this year but did manage a few.                 A special thank you to Joey, Julie, Wayne and Leah from both Sydney and I for all your help."
