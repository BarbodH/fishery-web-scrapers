594747,kickingfrog,2011-06-20 20:23:00,8333,No idea.
594753,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 20:33:00,4661,24 cans = 35-40 dollars
594761,Terry,2011-06-20 20:42:00,14456,in may cases the stores in the US buy direct from the company  in Canada distributors buy from the company and sell to the stores so we pay their mark up
594914,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-06-21 02:24:00,0, more like $5 i believe.  it's a joke.  some days in sault ste. marie the bridge traffic is insane just from canadian shoppers going to get gas and milk.  money that could be kept in canada if we weren't being gouged.
594967,Billy Bob,2011-06-21 10:35:00,5865," Terry, I really don't think so....as we have our share of beer distributors here also. Yesterday I purchased my beer from a chain of drug stores that always has beer on sale...even our big super markets have their beer delivered from distributors....I just think their is more mark up on many items in Ontario....like we have on a pack of cigarettes.... our NYS tax is $4.35 per PACK...so that drives the price way over $9 per pack...now you know why so many go to the Res here for cigarettes. I don't know for sure but I think your alcohol and cigarettes are also highly taxed for your health care system where NYS just blows it on nonsense."
594973,desship,2011-06-21 11:18:00,96,I bought a used craftsman lawn tractor wanted to buy filters for it but refused to pay the $20 for oil and $27 PRICE TAG FOR SIMPLE AIR FILTER.SEARCHED ONLINE AND FOUND ALL THE PARTS AT HALF THE PRICE BUT BRIGS AND STRATTON WOULD NOT SHIP TO CANADA AND REDIRECTED ME TO CANADIAN DISTRIBUTOR AT THE HIGHER PRICES.EVEN ON EBAY I COULD NOT FIND ANYBODY THAT WOULD SHIP OIL FILTERS UP HERE. I LUCKED OUT AND FOUND RITTENHOUSE IN HAMILTON.  THE $27 AIR FILTER IS NOW $13 WHICH IS REASONABLE.WE MAY NOT HAVE THE CUSTOMER BASE THEY HAVE IN THE STATES BUT WE DO HAVE AN OPTION SHOP AROUND AND FIND THE BEST BUY.
594977,bigugli,2011-06-21 12:10:00,6138,"Walmart buys from whoever they can get the best deal from, period, for all of North America. There is very little autonomy for Walmart Canada. Same for all big box stores."
594983,Rattletrap2,2011-06-21 12:32:00,1652,"GREED! They charge what they think they can get away with. Whether it be the wholesaler, distributor, or retailer. Some day they will get the picture, but for now, we buy from where we see fit."
595000,Lunker777,2011-06-21 13:12:00,866," Are you complaining about $9 cigarettes ??? I dont smoke, but I think a pack here is about $16 bucks ??  I use skoal from time to time..... a Tin of Skoal in Canada...upwards of $18 ..... in the states.... you can find them on sale...two for $5 bucks.... reg. price is about $4 and some change. Explain to me where the $14 difference is ?"
595008,mike rousseau,2011-06-21 13:29:00,4661,"  Look up ""the ship-it shop"" if you live near a USA border...  I use them for all my USA ordered purchases and it's only $3 for most small packages...  They need your name... Phone number... And email address...  And when you ship to them you just put ATTN and your name in the comments box or the address box"
595047,Billy Bob,2011-06-21 15:19:00,5865," Not complaining about the price of cigarettes as I don't smoke either...just using it as a comparison product...didn't have any idea what people pay in Canada to smoke...but at $16 per pack I would think a lot of them quit or don't take up the nasty habit, especially kids."
595054,Lunker777,2011-06-21 15:51:00,866,"I agree.... any tobacco habit is a BAD habit... and an expensive one at that. I think the problem is, no one realizes the amount of $$$ they spend on the habit per/yr.... or even a month. Like I said, I chew from time to time, the only time I can afford to is when I cross the border and can buy the chew there. The price has dropped here... but still $13.5 for a tin that lasts roughly 3-4 days  ?? Its expensive, and deadly !"
595120,LeXXington,2011-06-21 19:56:00,1928,If with Shipping / duty / taxes its cheaper buying from the US I will.  I love the local tackle shop and don't mind a buck or 2 difference but there is no way I am going to pay 50% difference in some of the larger items.  Greed will only get you so far before I decide it's not worth shopping at your store.
595148,Canuck2fan,2011-06-21 22:04:00,1444,"A few years ago when the dollar here approached par with the U.S. dollar a lot of companies were pressed to explain why there was such a huge price difference on some items. A few basically hummed and hawed and blew smoke. Some former industry insiders blamed tariffs and higher taxes here. Some more honest former industry insiders told the truth, the prices are higher in Canada because we will pay them. That is captialism folks and they charge what the market will bare. Doesn't make it easier to accept but if they can get away with jacking prices for us why wouldn't they?"
595154,danbouck,2011-06-21 22:50:00,4380,FYI - a pack of smokes here are around $9 or a carton off the reserve is 15 - 20
594535,grimsbylander,2011-06-20 11:59:00,3016,"I ended up in Niagara Falls NY on the weekend and had time to wander around the fishing sections of a few stores(translate; wife was shopping ). Now let me say I am a great believer in supporting your local economy and will continue to, however, it actually ticked me off to see essential items like line(brand name braided and flouro), terminal tackle, plastics at 50-70% less than the exact product here. How can Yum plastics be on sale for $1.96/bag?? PowerPro $12 and change?  And, yes I bought 4 bags of the plastics...and actually feel guilty for some damn reason. What's the general concensus on this???  Dave"
594543,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 12:14:00,4661,Well... Here is a story...  I bought a flasher at gander mnt in the USA... I got it retail for what my friend ( a store owner) would have paid wholesale... So after his mark up... He would have profited let's say 100 bucks... Or I buy in the USA and I save 100 bucks... Either way a Canadian has an extra 100 bucks... And I pay both governments their taxes...  So stop me if im incorrect... But what's wrong with that????
594544,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 12:21:00,4661,Ive seen reef runners for $2 in bargain bins over there... $2!!!!!!  I was told by a tackle shop owner that there is an instant mark up if your store is in Canada and your wholesaler is in the USA... Like 20-40% or something like that
594545,OhioFisherman,2011-06-20 12:26:00,6623,Purchasing power? Stores here buy for a market of 330 million in Canada 40 million? There is generally more pricing competition?  We have all that cheap Chinese labor?
594548,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 12:35:00,4661, Small town fish shops aren't selling to 330 million people...
594554,Harrison,2011-06-20 12:42:00,2202,"Wholesale price on a Rapala is $2+ more in Canada then the US.  Look at the price label on the back of books, if there was room to put it on lures there would be the same price gap.   I wonder if the big box stores like Walmart have to buy from Canadian Distributors.  I have no idea, but one would assume so."
594556,Lunker777,2011-06-20 12:47:00,866,"I just picked up TWO Curado 200E7 reels @ gander mountain for $129 !!!!!!!!!! show me some where that can touch that price in canada and Ill go pick up another two tomorrow ! Oh ya, and they had Rapala DT series...3 for $10 !"
594558,Harrison,2011-06-20 12:57:00,2202," Never see that here for the Curado.  Never.  And the DT's, they were probaly the lost leader and they still got their wholesale out of it.  Nothing personal, but I do get annoyed when people compare the US market to the Canadian.  There is no way a Canadian tackle vendor can compete against the US pricing.  I've been researching this industry for over 10 years just waiting to pull the trigger and open my own shop."
594564,Rod Caster,2011-06-20 13:16:00,5784,"If it wasn't for some shipping prices, and fear of losing my items, I would buy from the US all the time.  Our salaries are definitely not 20-30% higher, why/how can we pay/afford that much more. This subject grinds my goat."
594572,grimsbylander,2011-06-20 13:51:00,3016,"It's obvious that Canadian retailers cannot compete with US retailers...the question is why. Assume that everything is made in China therefore no manufacturing advantage either way...shipping to Canada and US from China - same. Our currencies are at par...Hmmm. What's different? Market share?? Yes, if we say that the US has 300 million people vs Canada's 40 million, BUT, if nothing or very little is manufactured here then it's simply a North American market of 340 million! I think the companies have us well trained. The company I work for reduced the labour workforce here in Hamilton by 80% and shifted the manufacturing to eastern Europe. Costs to manufacture were reduced by more than 50%...the amount we decreased our prices? Zero. Charge what the market will bear. I cannot believe that Walmart USA buys Berkley products cheaper than Walmart Canada. Why would Walmart surrender their buying power in Canada? I'm speculating of course.  I gave myself a Blah, Blah for rambling!  Dave"
594593,muddler,2011-06-20 14:26:00,623,"  I couldn't agree more. ""Charge waht the market can bear"" has been the norm here in Canada for a long time.  I am on a fixed income so my buying power is limited. I buy a lot of my stuff directly from China (Hong Kong usually)now and I pay as little as 90% less than the same product (also made in China) here. Shipping is usually free and no taxes and tariffis. Fishing tackle is not as abundantly available as in Canada but a little searching will result in savings. I just cannot afford to pay the high prices here in Canada. I have always been frugal and I bought bulk when the prices were low. I found a bag of 100 black head jigs with the old price tag still on it. 7.99. that was 10 years ago at Lebarons. My local tackle store sells jigs at a starting price of 2.99 per 3. Sorry I can't afford that. Another store sells jigs at 3.99 per 10. A little more affordable.  Times are tough, and all indications are that they will get tougher.  I want the best bang for the buck. I don't think that the fish know what the lure cost when it hits my bait. I cannot justify paying $10+ per bait and loosing a couple of baits per week.  muddler"
594621,Harrison,2011-06-20 15:34:00,2202,Just brutal.  In various articles I have read they all seem to echo that Canada's large middle class and the lack of serious competition keep prices high.
594626,adempsey,2011-06-20 15:45:00,1498,"Don't forget the currency exchange.  Even though our dollar has gotten stronger, most stores aren't going to change prices to reflect that.  Actually, many raised prices as a result.  You also mentioned they were on sale.  I purchased bags of Yum for $2 (BPS sale last year I think) and PowerPro for $12 (Le Baron a couple of months ago) on sale here too.  Also, it is a different country with a different tax system and a much larger population.   Why do people always assume the cost of goods should be the same in the US and Canada?  Heck, the tackle prices at some stores, like Canadian Tire, are 20-50% more than a lot of places within the same city!"
594633,Harrison,2011-06-20 15:53:00,2202," The cost to import these products is a large part of the increase.  We have to pay for our gubberment programs some how.  PS.. FishLogic, huge chicken fan."
594645,grimsbylander,2011-06-20 16:12:00,3016,"  That's a good point. It is possible that government duties drive up costs to the suppliers who in turn have no choice but to pass it along. Makes sense.  We all get that it's a different country and I don't think anyone should expect the prices to be the same. It just appears the gap may be larger than it should be...maybe not.  BTW, regular price on Yum was $3 and no the PowerPro was not on sale. These two items mean nothing in the scheme of things, they were just two examples I happened to look at that day. I guess the same could be said for gas and beer!"
594680,kickingfrog,2011-06-20 17:35:00,8333,"higher minimum wage health care available to everyone higher employer costs small population (relative) huge geographical area   Doesn't mean I like paying more, or that we are not getting hosed on some prices, but there are some legitimate reasons for a price difference."

594683,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 17:45:00,4661,   This post doesn't really make sence... Cause if you buy in the USA ... You still pay Canadian tax and sometimes have to pay duty... Wich pays for your healthcare ... Schools... Etc...  And even after tax and duty and gas to go to the USA... You still save $$$$   Like I posted earlier... Wholesalers have a price list for American shops... And a different price list for Canadian shops wich is a certain % higher...
594687,Billy Bob,2011-06-20 17:51:00,5865,Probably the best comparison would be the price of gasoline...The USA imports most of it's oil from Canada and right now our gas prices in NYS (one of the nations highest) is $3.85 per gallon.....at the Res...it's now $3.48 to $3.51 per gallon...what's the price in Ontario ?
594706,kickingfrog,2011-06-20 18:39:00,8333,   Then I am no use to you. Carry on.
594709,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 18:40:00,4661,1.22 a liter x 3.8 = 4.63 per gallon  I think that's the multiplier... 3.8
594732,Billy Bob,2011-06-20 19:57:00,5865, That sounds right....so gas is about 80 cents per gallon more....another good comparison would be BEER....just got back from the store and it cost me $16.99 (plus 8.75% tax) for a 32 pack of Labatts.....
