I am one of those types that doesn't really wear his life jacket mostly due to the fit and comfort.  I want to change this so I wear my life jacket as much as possible.   I don't really want to drop the coin for an inflatable one just yet (although, I do own a small waist pouch manual inflatable) so was looking at my options.  Of course, I have to go try some on (and I have, but it was a while back), but was looking into the Mustang Deluxe Fisherman's Vest and the standard Nylon Water Sports Vest (the price difference is about $40 between these two) - trying to take advantage of the LeBaron sale on these (15% off).  Anyone have any recommendations or had any problems with the Mustang vests?  Thanks for any help."
595019,bigbuck,2011-06-21 14:02:00,2449,I've got a Mustang fisherman's vest and it's fine for me. I'm a big guy and it fits and is comfy.
595021,HTHM,2011-06-21 14:04:00,4082,An inflatable is well worth the money IMHO. You can find them on Kijiji sometimes.
595028,Roy,2011-06-21 14:19:00,13728,"Your best bet is to go try them on for fit and comfort. Assuming they are all approved vests, they'll all do what they're supposed to do so it becomes a question of comfort/price."
595035,Pikeslayer,2011-06-21 14:51:00,1443,My 2 cents; 'Water sport' vests are somewhat heavy & hot when wearing outside of water. Not comfortable for fulltime wear/use on the boat.  Slayer
595039,Terry,2011-06-21 15:06:00,14456," yeah, find one you like and will wear, if it's comfortable. that's what you want"
595102,adempsey,2011-06-21 19:28:00,1498,Thanks for the suggestions/advice.  I will go and try some on.  Cheers.
595107,NANUK,2011-06-21 19:37:00,797,"Mustang Auto Inflatable, very comfortable to wear and twice the buoyancy compare to a regular life jacket."
595436,jediangler,2011-06-22 18:54:00,1923,Salus PFDs are made in Waterloo and are some of the most comfortable on the market.  http://www.salusmarine.com/  Gotta support Canadian manufacturers.
595438,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-22 19:00:00,10439,I have a manual inflatable vest and I do find myself actually wearing it where I wouldn't with a regular vest.
