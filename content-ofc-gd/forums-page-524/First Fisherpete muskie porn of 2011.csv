594707,Fisherpete,2011-06-20 18:39:00,1814,"9 days on the water. 2 hardcore fishermen. 100+ hours fishing. 4 muskies. 30"" 48"" 32"" 37"" (caught in that order)  Yep, muskie fishing can be tough. The consolation? My buddy Pat, who has been fishing skis with me for 10 years, beat his PB by a mile. He had been stuck at 38"" since 2007. He now stands at 48"", tied with my PB from last September!  We also caught TONS of other species while fishing for the skis... pike, bass, walleye... but as the saying goes, they are all just bait  My 37""   Pat's 48""   A few other of my catches from the past week... watch out for Team One...!  32"" salmon   32.5"" carp "
594711,mike rousseau,2011-06-20 18:44:00,4661,It's been a tuff start to the year for musky...  I've been out twice and only boater 2 skis...  Last year my first 2 days gave me 6 skis...

594715,Rizzo,2011-06-20 18:51:00,4754,man you get a lot of hours on the water (have to show this post to my wife who thinks I fish a lot!). That 48 is a beaut. We've had a decent start to the year (7 fish in 5 days) but no 48's to show for it!
594783,camillj,2011-06-20 21:33:00,1988,Atta boy Pete ! ... Hope you got a logo pic for that carp .. I am pretty sure we need one of those for team 1
