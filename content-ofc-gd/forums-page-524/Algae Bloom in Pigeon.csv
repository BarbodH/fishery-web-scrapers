Do you think this algae bloom will affect Buckhorn given that the 2 lakes are connected?  We booked a cottage on Buckhorn for the 1st week of July and wondering if we should stay out of the water.  Thanks!

595143,jediangler,2011-06-21 21:59:00,1923,It didn't affect the muskies or walleye on Saturday.   Both of these fish were caught in the algae bloom on Saturday.
