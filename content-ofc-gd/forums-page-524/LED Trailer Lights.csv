594805,smally21,2011-06-20 22:14:00,993,cerka industries milton if you ever go that way. great prices on brand names. the led lights at pa for 87$ are crazy expensive for PA quality.i guess if they were on sale. bass pro shops price isnt bad i beleive they are optronics which is standard on stratos and ranger boat trailers.  dont bother unplugging your lights no matter what you use.
594809,SlowPoke,2011-06-20 22:18:00,2984,"Usually not a problem Roy; if you're getting at snow not being melted off the lens.  Where you run into some difficulty is if there is a ledge below the light and it collects snow. With that said, the LED intensity tends to glow right through the snow. I wonder sometimes how anybody could see my lights at the end of a long run with the truck but when I stand back, you can see 'em glowing right through the snow.  I know on my boat trailer, they is no place for snow to sit and obscure the light but it might be a consideration for some."

595124,cityfisher,2011-06-21 20:25:00,959,everyone carries them.. go with LED...worth the upgrade
595199,limeyangler,2011-06-22 00:33:00,5204,Get 'em Brian.  I was a bit broke when i was at Princess auto so did not pick them up.  A couple months later my wife bought me a set for $70 at CT.  I was getting through way to many bulbs etc....the vibration on the logging roads would either mean i needed to replace a bulb or the whole unit. I had the stupid things all zip tied up.  I have been to many lakes along some pretty rough roads so far this season and not one problem with the lights. I LIKE 'EM!  And they are bright too....really light up even during the day like someone else already mentioned.  And thanks to this thread i wont be unplugging anymore before backing into the lake!  :thumbsup_anim:
230036,SlowPoke,2008-07-20 01:39:00,2984,"So, I have a broken right taillight lens (and a bent fender) from some kind soul at Lakair and now my left brake/signal is out. Time for a new light kit.  Has anybody used the low-profile LED lights from Princess Auto? PA is hit and miss for quality and they have a great return policy but I don't want to install them to find out they're crap.  Any other sources or recommendations for Low-Profile LED Lights?  -Brian"

230046,wallyboss,2008-07-20 02:17:00,1095,Supposedly they are really good.  No need to pull the plug to back the trailer in the water.  As they don't get hot
230092,Whopper,2008-07-20 11:43:00,2174,"Brian I switched to the LED lights three year ago and I like them, I bought mine at an auto parts store down here called Advance Auto Parts."
230093,muskymike,2008-07-20 11:54:00,772,"Got mine a few months back at CTC. From what it looks like, they look identical from the ones at PA.  They work great though and they only took about 10 mins to switch over from the standard old lights. They are worth the money.  I still disconnect everytime in the water tho, just to be safe."
230149,Muskieman,2008-07-20 14:12:00,2472,I suggest that you  try to not go too cheap when it comes to LED.... try to stick to companies like GROTE     or  Uni-Bond ...that's the stuff that fleet companies use ... and the stuff that I sell every day.  Try to buy a high count LED....tighter grouping of diodes ... diodes in these lights are connected in groups of 3 - 6...if one burns out  3 or 6 go out...thus decreasing the service intervals = more diodes less servicing. LED units are all sealed...use a dielectric grease at the connection though.. LED does not get hot so put 'em in the lake.  A good  High Count 4'' stop & tail LED should run you about 50$ per side  this includes the grommet and the connector.... the economy version should run at about 35$ per side..  you can get these at any Jobber store like ...Auto Parts Extra [ Benson' ]...  Auto Sense...NAPA CTC....   Randy... In the rain..
230152,Mike the Pike,2008-07-20 14:16:00,3421,You know Brian just goo that boat you really want I know you can afford it.  The new Lund boat trailers all come with LED lights so just do it life is too short too wait.
230182,icefisherman,2008-07-20 15:35:00,952,"Brian,  Bass Pro has the kit - about $70 or so. But I told you about the place in Milton, go there and I am sure they'll be cheaper and will have good quality compared to PA.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
230443,Scott S,2008-07-21 02:07:00,203,"I bought my LED lights at CTC. Had coupons to cut the costs. I'm very happy with the LED lights, they really light up, even during the day! Scooter"
230541,BITEME,2008-07-21 12:13:00,1968,  A new LUND is nice and all but it wont catch you fish and chances are you will still fall overboard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
230757,SlowPoke,2008-07-21 19:38:00,2984,"Good advice Randy but I'm limited to the low-profile style. I'd be happy to pay $200 for a system that would never fail but I'm limited by the style.  Mike, I'm afraid that if I ""goo'd"" the boat I really want I would be kicked out of the dealership and could possible face obscenity charges. Dealers in Quebec must be more lenient about that stuff. I'm re-thinking the Lund route, I have my eye on something else!  Thanks Emil, I forgot about them... if you read this, PM me the link or I'll give you a call about that.  Pete, as I said to Mike I am off the Lund kick. The one I have in mind would be really hard to fall out of but the downside is they are also tough to puke out of. Bring a step ladder when you come aboard!  Thanks everyone for the comments! -Brian"
230854,chubbon,2008-07-21 23:55:00,15,"Brian try Peterbilt in London or Freightliner. I am pretty sure you will find them at Peterbilt though, they might be pricey but I believe they carry a lifetime warranty. Good Luck"
230933,Fang,2008-07-22 02:44:00,1330,"Brian  I drive real rough back roads through Trenton, Temagmi with my trailer. Was always blowing regular bulbs. Switched my whole system to LEDs from Princess Auto. Their full kit was on sale for about $60. Included both rear lights and 6 running lights. Easy install and wow are they bright and worth every penny."
230955,Mike the Pike,2008-07-22 03:31:00,3421, Peter I would rather fall overboard than puke overboard  Where is all those pics of the new boat you promised .Are you too busy scrubbing the deck .  Puke off Peter
231014,BITEME,2008-07-22 12:25:00,1968, Puke smuke done it lots will do it again im sure anyway too busy catching fish.......I hear you are coming in August bring your sock and your favorite lube!!!!!!!......beatch
231016,MrMike,2008-07-22 12:30:00,153,"Can, Tire carries them sometimes"
231279,jjcanoe,2008-07-22 21:34:00,744,"Chicken light for your boat trailer Brian???? but I guess you can't put them on your daycab   I rewired my whole trailer and added two light bars with leds as well as side marker /turnsignal leds all for less than $100 and most of the stuff was bought at Princess Auto.  Check my trailer out some time this weekend, I'll even help you out installing things.  jjcanoe"
231512,Fish4Eyes,2008-07-23 05:24:00,1022, What he said. I found princess auto to be much cheaper then Canadian Tire.
594698,scugpg,2011-06-20 18:13:00,1373,Just reviving an old thread....Is anyone else carrying the LED lights these days other than PA or CTC? PA's are around $79 for LED's. They have the regulars on for $20 this week they say submersible but LED seems the way to go.
594703,Roy,2011-06-20 18:28:00,13728, Unless you plan on using them in the winter.
594705,walleyemen,2011-06-20 18:38:00,316,"Pa leds and 3 years and counting, not once have i unhooked them for launching.Don't buy the other ones for $20 there junk!"
594729,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-20 19:49:00,10439,I have a set of PA led lights as well that I got on sale last year at 50% off. Just need to set the time aside to install them. LOL
594731,Flappn,2011-06-20 19:56:00,245,  LED trailer lights go on sale at princess auto tomorrow...save 40% off $19.99.
594739,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-20 20:05:00,10439, There ya go!!!! Don't forget the connectors as they're sold separately. Also I use the heat shrinkable crimp connectors to connect connectors into the existing harness. They are available at NAP and CTC for sure. They are a little more $$$ but they have hot glue in them that completely seals and waterproofs the connection. Don't forget the dielectric grease on the end that connects to the light.
594754,scugpg,2011-06-20 20:35:00,1373, Those aren't led though
