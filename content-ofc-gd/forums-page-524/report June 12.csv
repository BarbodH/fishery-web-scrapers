Only one decent 19"" ... their goes the whole morning... so we decided to hit bluegills and we caught maybe 50 or something pcs... and their taste, we fried them when we got home....    I caught a 36"" carp too that day...  and man this fish went crazy, I was using only 10lb line.... I thought I was going to lose this one but I was lucky to land this monster... Sorry team 10"" no upgrade to any of the fish I caught....  hopefully next week or when the bass season open... can't wait..    till next time again.. thnx for reading...  bfisher"
