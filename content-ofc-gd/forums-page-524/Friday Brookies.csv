But yesterday I made a dent in all this, by putting my day off to a better use, so fishing gear in hand and camera in my pocket, at 8:30 am I was wetting my line. It's been an epic 5  hours,  bugs tearing me a new one, but also constant action. I landed over 20 brookies and lost about 10 more -of course those were the largest... Most of the fish caught -and released to fight another angler- were small but such beautiful little jewels!    The only insect that didn't draw blood.     My little companions...                 "

The Iris  is a invasive Asiatic species, that is becoming more prevalent and not welcome at all. Like the dreaded purple loosestrife and hogsweed, it is an garden plant escapee from the popular garden ponds that are in vogue.  edit:  http://www.invasiveplants.ab.ca/Downloads/FS-YellowFlagIris.pdf  http://www.saanich.ca/living/environment/pdf/invasive/yellow-flag-iris-alert-web.pdf  http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biodiversity/problemplants/species/Yellow%20Iris.htm"
