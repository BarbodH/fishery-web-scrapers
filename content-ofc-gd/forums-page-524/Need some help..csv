595053,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-21 15:48:00,10439, Working on it. Iy will be done soon. I want it right before publishing. I'm not one to rush these things Mike. Besides it's summer in the arctic and I need to enjoy all 2 months of it!!! LOL. Been busy planting trees around my place and working on boats so I can do a little fishing. Priorities man.
