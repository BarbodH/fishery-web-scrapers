594570,pokerdemon4,2011-06-20 13:45:00,135,Got out for a day with fellow member Sinker. He is a great guide. Here is a 40 incher that nailed a weagle.  We fished hard and moved a couple more fish. The bite can only get better. Good luck out there. 
594576,Handlebarz,2011-06-20 13:53:00,3790,Nice going there is not much that beats a top water bite congrats
594598,Sinker,2011-06-20 14:39:00,8692,"Great day bud! That topwater hit was spectacular!! I get just as excited when someone else gets one, as I do when I get one myself!! Good times!!  BTW, that fish was over 40"".....more like 43"" or so. Good, solid, heavy fish.  S."
594611,ehg,2011-06-20 15:11:00,2666,"Nice going!  Congrats, probably the most exciting fishing experience. Not easy to get solid hookset on those musky using musky topwaters."
594614,guitardude_15,2011-06-20 15:19:00,16,"Beauty fish, top water is the best. They miss walk the dog style baits so often though! Congrats"
595475,JoshS,2011-06-22 20:47:00,729,Nothing beats a top water musky in my books. Nice catch
595495,pokerdemon4,2011-06-22 21:22:00,135,This was my first topwater musky. I had almost given up on topwaters for these fish. I have read that you will see more fish on a walk the dog topwater but you hooking percentage is the lowest with this style of bait. I fish topwaters for bass quite often. The key is setting the hook when you feel the fish. When I first started I would always pull the lure away and miss the majority of the strikes. I can't wait to go again. Good luck to all.
595499,rufus,2011-06-22 21:29:00,267,Trying top water Muskie fishing is definitely now on my to-do list this summer! Great fish - congrats
595523,guitardude_15,2011-06-22 22:15:00,16,"Definitely takes alot of patience, always have a throwback lure like a hell hound, manta or a soft bait my jackpot locates a lot of fish for me but hooks up with very few"
