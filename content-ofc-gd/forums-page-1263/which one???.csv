39311,Bob Devine,2007-02-24 05:14:00,251,"I used a Humminbird 987 SI last yr with the Side Imaging and was very happy with it.  The screen on the Humminbirds can be seen at all angles and with polarized glasses on. The SI units are neat and can be very helpful for locating structure.  Good luck with your decision,"
39409,sonny,2007-02-24 14:47:00,511,"hey bob,,,do you find it hard to decifer the side imaging,,,? "
39414,taper,2007-02-24 14:54:00,611,Lowrance all the way.
39480,Fisherman,2007-02-24 20:12:00,7201,"Sorry, but I would never consciously buy anything, (well maybe TP), with a Humminbuzzard label on it.  Have seen too many guys curse at and swear at their products.  That not being the worst, it's when you have to duck to avoid the junk coming back down on re entry after being space launced by mad fisher persons."
39483,gaffer,2007-02-24 20:16:00,12,"go with the lowrance,  you won't be disapointed"
