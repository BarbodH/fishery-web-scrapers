39024,pikeie,2007-02-23 20:19:00,380,just want to see what you will be focusing on catching  i myself i will be focusing on the perch and maybe lakers and whitefish later:dunno:
39029,Headhunter,2007-02-23 20:21:00,5703,"Not sure yet, I have to ask Terry tomorrow morning! I believe we will atleast start out after Lakers and Whities... depending on the bite, may move closer in for some dinner... uhm, I mean perch! HH"
39032,Joey,2007-02-23 20:25:00,9122,"I think we'll do the same, start out for some lakers and whites and then move in for some perch.  I guess it all depends on the bite.  Joey"
39042,tonyb,2007-02-23 20:43:00,1637,WHITEFISH!!! lol  But I'll take a Laker or Perch if I can't catch a Whitefish.  Tony
39046,LeXXington,2007-02-23 20:53:00,1928,"Anything that passes below,.. Perch or whites is the preference"
39052,Terry,2007-02-23 21:01:00,14456,"looks like we are all doing the same... some might run over to the better spots..fox willow and JP or some good spots for perch but I will be in the same area as last year strait out from the ramp then in closer for perch good luck to all...most people last year did more talking and eating then fishing and that was the key to winning ,so lets hope it's the same this year...cheers"
39107,tonyb,2007-02-23 21:52:00,1637," That is one heck of a walk Terry! I don't think I'd make it back    hehe  I think we'll be fishing out front of the park like last year, about 100-150yards or so I think to get to 60 fow.  Tony"
39111,Clampet,2007-02-23 21:54:00,1947,What Joey said.
39112,ccmtcanada,2007-02-23 21:54:00,7971,I'm not a picky person....anything that swims is fine with me!!!
39119,Terry,2007-02-23 22:00:00,14456,"tonyb, that is where I will be too I meant everyone who posted here so far will be fishing just out from the ramp first whitefish/trout then move in for perch but others who have not posted on this thread may go to willowbeach....lol"
39209,Beans,2007-02-24 00:58:00,3339,I didn't bother to set-up my laker/whitefish rod figuring I just target perch...but if a big old pike wants to tussle for a while...I wouldn't mind...
39403,dobber1978,2007-02-24 14:35:00,13,"NExt time I go out it will be for ling, lol, I have never caught one, hear that they are kind of nasty looking but great eating,  See what happens,"
