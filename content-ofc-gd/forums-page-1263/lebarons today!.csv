39512,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-24 22:11:00,2050,"Hey all,  Well, I've got hte winter blues and figured I better go spend a few dollars on fishing gear.  I was in need for a new ultra-light so that was my starting point.  When we got to Lebaron's I realised they had re-furb minnkota's on sale and boy what a steal - the exact motor I was going to buy this summer ( 30 lb thrust endura w/ forward & reverse speeds) was just over 80 bucks!!!!!! they're 159.00 @ canadian tire!  Also got myself a new Ultralight Berkley Lightnight rod - seems like a nice rod for 37 bucks..so all in all a great day shopping and if you're in the market for a new electric motor you should check out the sale they have going on...they've got bow mounts also!  Cheers, UF"
39525,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-24 22:29:00,1351,"just a tip about those, they are refurbished. but if you don't mind, not a bad deal. and the spring classic is happening soon at bass pro, im waiting to see what is there first. i doubt they'll sell out of those minn kotas in these two weeks."
39566,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-24 23:52:00,2050,"Hey Kevin,  Yepp, the Re-fub's have a one year warrantee on them, a little less than the usual two year, but I had the same motor in the past and it treated me well so I went with it.....I can't wait for the spring classic either...my old man's comin down from sudbury for the weekend! should be fun!  UF"
39586,John Bacon,2007-02-25 00:39:00,3277,Does that model have the built it Maximizer?  I do need to be pick up a motor for my inflatable.  Thanks for the tip.
39781,boatman,2007-02-25 14:20:00,350,You can't beat that deal. I have no problem with a refurb when its a quality product like that. Basspro had them last year for $99.99 and it was the cheapest around. This year they are back up to $120. CTC as much as I love them always over price stuff like that. You can usually find better fishing deals at your local tackle shop.
39784,Mike the Pike,2007-02-25 14:30:00,3421,I was at Le Barons the other day and saw the same thing reconditioned Mine Kota with Maximiser 50lbs of thrust for $259.00.
39814,BFSC Kevin,2007-02-25 15:50:00,1351,"hey mike, 259? i saw them for $275... and when were the 50lbs discountinued anyone knows?  opps. made an error, 275 not 175."
39818,The Urban Fisherman,2007-02-25 16:07:00,2050,"Here's a link to the minn kita specials on lebaron's website: http://www.lebaron.ca/english/specials.htm  BOATMAN: I was going to get an inflatable but talked my GF into letting me get a Bass Tender style boat....  Cheers, UF"
39819,Mike the Pike,2007-02-25 16:08:00,3421,I guess they determine the price by the age of the motor or perhaps you guys in Ontario pay less .Same company.I can not explain that one.
