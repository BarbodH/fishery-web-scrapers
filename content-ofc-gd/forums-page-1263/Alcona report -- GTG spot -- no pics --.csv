At about 1.5 km out on the way to fox there is a large slush area.  ATV's with no load just made it though. One ATV with a  small load was stuck for about 15min.  Sleds were ok.  The slush area is very wet with 6"" of water.  It will be the same on sat.  The ice was about 14"" thick with 8"" of snow on top.  There are a few snow drifts also.  I fished for a few hours and we caught some perch and there are alot of smelt.  We saw some bigger fish on the finder.  Good luck to everyone.  I will see you there."
