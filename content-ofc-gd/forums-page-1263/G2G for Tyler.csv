This is my idea:  There are  quite few members of this board not being able to attend this event ( whatever reason ) like me. But I think that WE can do something about it. The goal of this event is to raise funds to help Tyler. So this is my idea: Whoever planed ( or not ) to be there and for some reason had to change their plans ( already budgeted for this ), you can still help I will start with $50"
39055,motv8tr,2007-02-23 21:07:00,2587,"That's a nice idea Keram, and appreciated.  For those who wish to just make a donation all cheques should be made out to Elisa and Terry French (Tylers parents) .  You can send it care of me, Maureen Manning, 167 Timcourt Dr. Penetang Ont. L9M 1R2 .  Another way to help is to participate in the online auction that will begin Saturday night.  Maureen"
39058,TJQ,2007-02-23 21:08:00,7806,Great idea... im in for 50 bucks!
39115,Clampet,2007-02-23 21:57:00,1947,"Wow Keram, now that's what I call a donation! Yer a fine board member!"
39118,ccmtcanada,2007-02-23 22:00:00,7971,"I'll be at the event, but wow...very generous Keram and TJ!!!"
39159,Big Cliff,2007-02-23 23:10:00,6899,"Well, I just got back from the mail box and there was a cheque from Roy for $100.00. WOW my friend that was way more than expected but very much appreciated. It covered the entire cost of all the sausages (by the way, Len & Patti from the Butchers block in Lindsay made them into links for us and there are 114 regular and 114 Octoberfest). So, Justherb, Beans, and I will be kicking in a donation to help defray the cost of some of the other things that are needed.  Thank you so much to all those that have helped!  Roy I have always said you give 200% but you just proved it!  Friends like you are rare and it's not about the money!!!!!!!"
