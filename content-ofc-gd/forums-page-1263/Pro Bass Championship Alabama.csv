39766,just2manylures,2007-02-25 13:43:00,144,I got home late last night and was flicking through the channels and found a show about the pro bassmasters championship.  Any one catch this?  it was pretty cool to see all those big fish.  Boy I sure would love to catch 4 pound bass in Febuary.  Those bass boat guys really need to learn how to drive too.  This one guy cuts right in between 2 boats that were about 10 feet apart going 95 mph.  I couldn't believe it.  The tournament organization decided to dis-qualify him.  I thought they should have taken his boat away.  my 2 cents  2many

39777,pikehunter,2007-02-25 14:17:00,1659, Prob just another jerk with an overpowered big boy toy. They should never allow him to compete again.  just my 1 centx2 worth
