39548,ccmtcanada,2007-02-24 22:55:00,7971,"Well...we had an awesome time out on Lake Simcoe today for the Fishing for Tyler event!  Bly and I brought our 4 year old daughter, Sydney, with us on this day.  We arrived at around 11am and headed straight out on the ice to meet up with Joey and Tybo...and a bunch of other OFNers.  The wind had died down at this point and it was quite comfortable out on the ice.  Here are some pics from the ice...  Bly watching over our setups   Here's the captain of team 9...Patb  Gerritt...thanks for the venison and other goodies!!! No matter what everyone else on the board says...you're a nice guy....LOL   Tybo...lost in thought.  He complained he never caught anything here before.  He also let me know that he'll catch all the big game fish for the tourney for our team (6).  I have to catch a carp apparently...LOL.   Concentrating on catching some fish!!! Fishnsled and Headhunter.   My daughter, Sydney, and Joey having a nice chat and staying warm in the Clam.   Sydney playing with the worms!!!   At 1pm, we headed in for some grub and to meet up with other OFNers. Here's a shot of the area...with lots of hungry ice anglers!   The awesome cooks!! Thanks a bunch!! BigCliff and Loonietoon   Here's MrJr taking a break from the cooking station.   After eating, we had the pleasure of talking with lots of members on the board.  Here are few shots....  Tonyb, Carp and Joey   Motv8tr, Big Chevy and Ladywalleye   And here's Irishfield...   After the prizes for the event were handed out, there were LOTS of draws.  I think everyone took something home!  Here's what we won...   There were lots of others we met out there today...Clampett, Pikeie, Beans, Terry, DMasse, BPS Bassman, Tracker, and lots of others that I know I've forgotten.  Sorry if I didn't mention you by name....but you know who you are...LOL.  Also had a quick chat with Tyler and his mom.  They thanked me for coming...but I thanked her...because we had an awesome time out there.  We just wanted to say thanks Motv8tr and everyone who volunteered at this great event.  We had a great day and got to meet lots of great people."
