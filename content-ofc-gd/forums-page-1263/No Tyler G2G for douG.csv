39065,douG,2007-02-23 21:12:00,2693,"Been off work since Wednesday, the Dr. sez I have puemonia peunomia ponemia infectious bronchitis.   How do I know it's infectious?  Ask the Resident Love Goddess, but I'd ask you wait a week or so for the sake of marital harmony.  He said to use two puffers, take some antibiotics, and use this cough syrup.   Let me tell you, this cough syrup if sold on Queen St, could probably pay for the rest of the junk.  So no G2G for me  .  I know you will all have a great time, enjoy.  At least this will cut down on the incriminating photos."
39069,motv8tr,2007-02-23 21:16:00,2587,"Dang Doug, I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you and your resident love goddess are feeling better soon.  Maureen"

39217,douG,2007-02-24 01:07:00,2693,"We are dropping like hacking flies around here tonight, with RLG and the BigKid all flat on their backs.  Instructions have been given to The LittleOne to find another place to crash for a while, with the proviso that she may already have it and will infect others.  I have a quarantined area, but it's full of fishing gear, camping stuff, empties, old paint, bicycles, tools and etc.  It's also a little chilly, so I guess the garage is out of the question.  One of my issues, now that I'm feeling a little  better, is that I am way undersmoked, only choked back two and a half smokes all day.  Nicorette sorta helps, but I think it gives me gas.  Something is doing it right now, that's for sure.  PatB, mebbee it's a better thing that you don't pick me up tomorrow morning.  Gastric displeasure is not a thing to be shared among friends.  Best to you."
39274,Nanook,2007-02-24 02:39:00,565,"Get well soon Doug. Took me 10 days to start feel better,but then. I was slow getting the Quacks. Drags ya down a bit, so rest up, plenty of fluids. Cya !!!"
