39386,jil101ca,2007-02-24 13:49:00,41,"So I rented a bungalow in Calander Bay from Terrace Suites for 3 days and 2 nights. Nice hut, good hospitality, fishing sucked. there are no fish in calander Bay. No body was catching much of anything so it wasn't just us lol. Didn't take many pics, there was nothing to take pics of. We did have a good time anyways, 3 days with no children was blissful (i have 3, 2 being teen boys)  The City   Our Castle   Mark enjoying himself   I caught 4 of these in 3 days, all this size   I caught this in the middle of the night, thought maybe it was a walleye.Was not impressed to see him at 3 am   Which reminds me: if a person brings a fish in using someone elses line (say, their wife's) who's fish is it? Mark pulled a fish in on my line because I was busy doing something and he says it is his fish. I say it was mine and he is still skunked. Professesional opions needed here lol"

39422,woodro,2007-02-24 15:19:00,168,"that sucks you didnt catch fish, but thats why its called fishing and not catching. I heard its best to fish calandar bay early in the season."
39427,Roy,2007-02-24 15:44:00,13728,"Thanks for the report, Joyce. I'd suggest that Paul put the yellow snow out back the next time tho'. :-)"
39740,dsn,2007-02-25 12:35:00,1018,jil101 did you have fishfinder or anything to see what depth you were fishing in? Or anything to see if there were weeds around? I would never ice fish blind. Its tough.   dsn
39746,Mike the Pike,2007-02-25 12:52:00,3421,Your line your fish.MTP
39755,b2kptbo,2007-02-25 13:17:00,1505,"Looked like a nice setup, too bad about the fish..."
39764,ccmtcanada,2007-02-25 13:39:00,7971,"Hey...even though the fishing sucked, it was a great report.  Nice accomodations there....at least you fished in comfort.  Thanks for the pics!"
39775,Joey,2007-02-25 14:10:00,9122,"Hey at least you got away for the kids for awhile Joyce.  And it doesn't appear there were many fish being caught anywhere this weekend.  I think its your fish - your line, your fish (you were probably cooking him dinner anyhow when you were busy   )  Paul says - you fight it, its yours.  Joey"
39796,glen,2007-02-25 15:05:00,2641,You have to figure it out before you start fishing.  My way is dont touch my line unless i ask you to keep and eye on it.  If ask you and you pull in a fish it is then your fish.  My buddy tells a story about his uncle not near his line and getting a bite.  So buddy brings in the fish.  His uncle   says the fish is mine and it is now mounted on the uncles wall.  I wonder what he says when people ask how did that big one bite.
39860,Clampet,2007-02-25 18:05:00,1947,"Yesterday we had that North wind blowin', and I knew the fishing would be poor."
39875,Clampet,2007-02-25 19:07:00,1947, Didn't she say his name was Mark?
