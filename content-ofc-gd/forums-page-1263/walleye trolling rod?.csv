37894,carll2,2007-02-22 01:04:00,443,awesome thanks i use to have a really amazing lure its the luhr jensen hot lips  with the big lip silver/blue..it would  get down to about 30-33 feet and get those walleye to bite but they stopped making them..  ..il figure out the winning lure again
37898,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 01:09:00,1780,"You'll find it. But it's easy to add and remove weight on any lure to get the depth so don't worry to much, the action of the lure is what it's all about,  it will take time to find your favorite actions to, nothing beats time on the water."
37932,carll2,2007-02-22 01:43:00,443,"i cant wait to get on the water..i leave as soon as the ice goes..normally the ice goes the 2nd week of may, last year it went the end of the 1st week..im hopeing the ice will be gone for may 1st  so i have tome to settle in and find the spots..atleasrs il have some good pics when i get back"
38245,trapshooter,2007-02-22 15:40:00,1234,"If you are intent on fishing cranks/minnow baits down deep, GbayGiant had the best advice of attaching a floating plug (eg, the rapala floaters) behind a bottom bouncer.  A 3 way swivel & some weight will also do the same thing.  Remember, the longer the lead the more the bait will be able to dive so keep that in mind.  I would be more inclined to jig at those depths but whatever works for you.  Cheers, ben."
38353,Headhunter,2007-02-22 19:16:00,5703,"It seems to me that a Lead Core set up would be the best of all worlds for your application... then, you could run just about any crank you want, at the desired depth. Also, don't forget about Offshore's snap weight system as another alternative. For cranks, try; Wally Divers, LJ Power Dives, Manns Stretch 20, HotnTot, any deep diving Rap ... HH"
38384,carll2,2007-02-22 20:07:00,443,"prettty good advice guys.. man there are so many options.. well let the lure shopping begin.. there is lots of stumps at the bottom since they logged it and flooded it so for this reason i was thinking of going with spider-wire 30lb with a 6lb diameter. this way i can use it to jig and or troll without using leaders, thats what my friend does with great sucess"
38406,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 20:58:00,1780,"I mostly use 20lbs braided line and have never had it break yet, It bends the jig hook before the line breaks. However it cuts very easy on sharp objects and is highly visible in the water, so I always go with usually a 20lbs fluorocarbon leader of 3-4 feet usually that is invisible and can handle some sharp objects, just check it for nicks once in a while.  But the superlines will cut like butter when they hit something sharp (teeth or rocks etc..) so they are not good leaders."
38420,trapshooter,2007-02-22 21:30:00,1234,"GbayGiant has it right... I too always use a mono or fluorocarbon leader when jigging or even casting cranks with a braided line.   If you have 2 jigging rods, I suggest putting a braided line on one and 8lb mono on the other.  I only jig walleye with braided line once I start fishing 20-25 feet or deeper."
38484,carll2,2007-02-22 23:12:00,443,"ahhh very interesting.. awesome tips guys yeah my friend that uses spider wire  cuts the line and re ties the lure after every 3-4 fish, or else like you say it get very weak  and will cut easily..il have 3 reels one with  spider wire 20lbs. one with stren 8lb clear mono and stren 8lb gold ...i should have alll the bases covered..man i never knew beeing a guide was this much preperation lol but i cant wait"
38487,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 23:17:00,1780,"You got some good info here, these guys know there stuff, it's amazing how you can gain years of knowledge on this site in minutes."
38490,carll2,2007-02-22 23:24:00,443,i know  the knowledge everybody has around here is really great. i learned more here in 2 days than  i would have in 1 year. now hopefully this fall i will have some tips and tricks of my own to share with other newbies that need some help. and dont worry i will have more questions before i leave lol thanks again
39286,carll2,2007-02-24 03:21:00,443,"well guys i made the big purchase today. i bought my rod/reel from a local tackle shop that i buy everything from. i rather support a local tackle shop than a big store like cablas or le baron,plus this guy gives me a 10% discount from beeing a member on a quebec fishing website. so here what i bought rod-Fenwick techna av  6""6 reel(spinning)- shimano symetre 2500ri and with the rod i got a free fenwick rodcase  in all this set me back 300$ tax included.. not bad now i have the hunting and fishing show tommrow, lets see what kind of lures i can find thanks again for all the help"
39299,GbayGiant,2007-02-24 04:20:00,1780,"Damn I forgot how much good fishing gear is.  No' but that's a great set-up and warranty, you'll fall in love with that one.  Just a thought for you, I got my first wood handled rod 2 years ago and I can feel a jig or lure bounce of each pebble or anything it touches, and the red cedar used you can't even tell the difference in weight it's still super light and far more sensitive than cork. Just think of the vibration you get when you hit a wood baseball bat, now I'm getting all my rods with wood handles.  I have a sensitivity problem when it comes to walleye.  P.S. I think you went over your 100-$200 budget."
39302,carll2,2007-02-24 04:45:00,443,"hey i love the rod already..i have a spot in my bed for it already!!! lol.. i know the whole budget thing was blown but as you guys explained to me im better getting quality since i will be using it day in and day out. now i cant wait to use it, is it really that sensative that you feel every rock and pebble?wow.  one little question i was wondering about since i need all these rod/reels for work tools next year may i claim them on my taxes or atleast a percentage?"
39304,Headhunter,2007-02-24 04:52:00,5703,Only if you claim the income! HH
39309,carll2,2007-02-24 05:09:00,443,ok well i will be declared  by the place im working for so i can claim unemployement for the off season.. so  does that count as me claiming the income? thnks
39310,carll2,2007-02-24 05:11:00,443,oh yeah and also to claim my fishing stuff on taxes do i need a decleration(sp?)  from my employer stating that i used my own earning to buy my tackle/equipment?
37745,trapshooter,2007-02-21 22:09:00,1234,"Hey Carll2,  YOu can get the fenwick Techan AV rod in baitcaster or spinning rod!      Definitely look into that rod, you will not be disappointed.   If  you already have 2 spinning rods for jigging, lindy rigging, throwing smaller walleye sized cranks then you should be good.  Get a Medium Heavy 6.5-7' baitcasting rod/reel (eg, Techna and Shimano Castaic reel) for throwing larger sized baits for pike and using for bottom bounching for walleye as well.  If I could only take 3 rods those would be them.  2 spinning set-ups and 1 baitcasting set-up.  Like I said before I am partial to Shimano reels, Stradic's for my spinning rods and I have a few different baitcasters including the Castaic (the one with the flipping switch) on my bouncing rod.  Learning to throw a baitcaster takes about 5 mins or less if you have someone show you how to do it properly.  Ask at the show or in the shop where you buy your gear from.  It's all about setting the brake properly and you have to adjust it for every different bait you put on (unless the baits are the same weight).  Just practice.  When I got my first baitcaster I was in the backyard throwing 1/2 oz of lead around before I could get out on the water.  As far as tackle goes.... we are spoiled and use a lot of live bait for walleye.  Jig/minnow or a spinner/minnow rig when bottom bouncing.  Get a bag of power worms for a minnow harness if you can't get the real thing.  If they're snapping it doesn't matter if it's a plastic worm and then you won't have to change worms every fish.  Much easier.  As for jigs, I'll start in the spring using 1/4 or even 1/8 (sometimes finessing them is the only way and I'll downsize to 6lb test mono as well) and work my way up to 1/2oz and 5/8 once we get to fishing 30+ feet and/or it is windy.  Not sure how deep your lake is but you might want to consider some heavier jigs.   Personally I only use white twister tails if I use them at all but never hurts to try.  I like a bare jig with my minnow hooked in his mouth, out the gills then back through the side of the minnow so his lips are kissing the ball head of the jig.  Stays on longer and gets the hook point a bit farther back.  For walleye cranks the only 2 I really use are xraps (size 10, white/pearl) and Cotton Cordel grappler shads.   Lots of other stuff will work though.  Throwing for pike, definitely get some large Husky Jerks in varous colours, SUPER SHAD RAP (for sure!), a bucktail inline spinner, spinner bait, spoons, larger baits like jakes or gramma's... typical pike stuff.  If they are active they'll hit at anything that has some flash, vibration, movement.  Lots of stuff will work so don't take this list as gospel.   Spend more time looking for prime spots then switching baits.  Also, you'll need your terminal tackle.. swivels, snaps, line (8lb mono for walleye, I use triline XL).  I recommend braid on the baitcasting set up if you choose to go that way, 30 lb would be great.  If I am jigging with braid I will always use a mono or fluorocarbon leader.  Other stuff I can't live with out....  Gor-tex rain suit (coat and bib pants) proper layering cloths to keep warm and dry Rubber boots fillet knife and sharpener SUN SCREEN - anyone remember my pics from my first year?!?!  I was a tomato!  haha Water bottle for the boat. I like to carry a small fuel container for gas in the boat.  Use it start shore lunch fires if it's damp out.  MEC sells nice little ones from MSR. A dry bag for valuables in the boat. Camera Needle Nose Pliars and/or Leatherman tool GPS (for marking structure and incase you get turned around)  I could go on like this......  Let me know if  you have any other questions.  Cheers, Ben."
37841,carll2,2007-02-22 00:11:00,443,"thanks for all the help ben i made up my mind finally and will be going with the  fenwick techna 6""6 and will be going for the regular stradic. as for hard baits  i have one question. i will be fishing a reservoir thats 250 miles long with all the bays and islands with many deep spots.. ranging anywhere from 1-230feet deep. now only question i have is for summer eyes, i need a crankbait lure that will make it down to 30feet deep .they seem to hold there from july till closing. any suggestions on deep diving crankbaits? keep in mind the average size wallye are 2-3lbs with some big ones in there. thanks again"
37849,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 00:18:00,1780,"There are a few that get to 30', but if they don't you can just use a 3way swivel and add weight accordingly to reach your desired depth. I also use floating lip-less minnows behind bottom bouncers sometimes."
37857,carll2,2007-02-22 00:25:00,443,can you share with me which ones get to the 30 feet deep range? i had thought of manns but the baits are huggeee..theres also maybe reef runners? deep husky jerks? thanks
37882,GbayGiant,2007-02-22 00:54:00,1780,"I really don't know all the names of the baits on the market, but I do make my own crank-baits. Basically you will want the baits with the biggest lips you can find. The angle of the lip, the speed your trolling, your line diameter, and trolling with the wind or against it will all effect the depth. There is no guide, you will have to test each lure your self to know exactly what you need, because sometimes you will have to go slower and use a thicker line and in that case the only way would be to add weight. Hope that helps, no rule of thumb but usually the biggest lipped lures will dive the deepest."
