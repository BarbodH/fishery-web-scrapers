39522,holdfast,2007-02-24 22:24:00,1813,"I bought a Honda outboard 2 yrs ago when I moved to Wasaga beach.  Its an older (Blue) 4 stroke 15 HP push button elec start or pull 15 HP.  It looked mint and very clean possibly original grease inside the cover.  The only maint I done was changed oil.  Engine and bottom.  Heres the problem.  Last year at times, at full throttle it would just cut out. ( not often but enough not to trust it)  I would then open or close the air vent on the gas tank and then no problems.  Dont know if that really has any bearing but that was my first trouble shoot. Questions now.  What could be the problem, The sparkplug seems OK, and, should the gas tank vent be open or closed when running.  Thanks"
39524,tinbanger,2007-02-24 22:28:00,1028,open vent !
39526,holdfast,2007-02-24 22:32:00,1813,Would that cut the engine
39529,irishfield,2007-02-24 22:33:00,26272,Open Vent...and the possibility your intake screen is clogged.
39531,fishindevil,2007-02-24 22:36:00,6254,"yes it would ALWAYS HAVE THE VENT OPEN...that might be your problem right there,when it cuts out is the squeeze ball sucked flat or is it still full of gas,you might start be letting us know that....there is alot of smart guys here so im sure that they can figure this out for you...cheers"
39533,holdfast,2007-02-24 22:37:00,1813,Ball is inflated
39535,holdfast,2007-02-24 22:38:00,1813,I will have the throttle open and then without warning it cuts out.  No Lagging
39552,solopaddler,2007-02-24 23:19:00,8605,"If you ran it with the vent closed, that's almost certainly the cause of your problem Holdfast."

39722,SlowPoke,2007-02-25 06:17:00,2984,"Keep the vent open when you're running the engine as others have said. If you're running a plastic tank, the sides might be getting sucked in before the primer bulb collapses. -Brian"

39776,boatman,2007-02-25 14:13:00,350,The problem is called vapour lock. If your fuel cap doesn't have a vent screw on it then you need to open the cap a couple turns when operating the motor. It is one of the most common causes of engine stalling.
