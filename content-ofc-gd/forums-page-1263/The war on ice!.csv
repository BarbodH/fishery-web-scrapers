39509,holdfast,2007-02-24 21:53:00,1813,"What! We have an ice breaker? seems we dont need Ships, Soldiers, Sailors, Airman, Equipment, and money for defense.  Lets face it we can always rely on the American to aid us.  Theyre our friends.  The arts is where I want my taxes to go to.  Just Kidding.  Hopefully we can help as we will always do."
