39511,Clampet,2007-02-24 22:10:00,1947,"Well, Miss Hathaway and I attended the Tyler Meet and Greet in Alcona, Innisfil, On. Gotta say Maureen (Motivator) did a real great job of organizing the event. Everything went without a hitch. Food was well prepared and hot. The guys, BPS Bassman, Big Cliff, and I’m sorry I’m terrible with names, did a great job of  serving the vittels.  Got to meet and see the following OFC Board members: Terry, Fishnsled, Beans, TonyB, Lexxington, Loonietoon, Ladywalleye, Big Chev 4x4, Dave Masse, Bowshep, Gerritt, Cliff and Carole and their daughter, Mr JR, Joey and Tybo, and of course Maureen, and Tyler.  After registering, Catherine and I headed out onto the Lake, and walked for about 15 minutes and I guess maybe ¾ of a mile out, slightly away from the slight congestion of huts.  In the midst of setting up shop, Dave Masse and Bowshep, stopped by on their way out. Unfortunately, when they started to walk away, Bowshep stepped into this large (14”) diameter hole not 5 feet from where I was standing.    It was concealed under a thin layer of snow and ice.  Anyway, he took a fall, and his leg went down up to past his knee.  He took a soaking. Dave decided that he and Bowshep should return to shore immediately, as his leg started to freeze up.  So they turned around and headed back to shore. A quick end to their outing.  Anyway got the Tarpus Maximus set-up.  And, you guessed it, about 30 minutes later the wind decided to switch from the North to the West North West.  So I took out Tarpus Minimus and married (co-joined) it to Maximus to created Tarpus Supremus.  This evolution took care of the situation.  Did not get a bite, but today was about Tyler, and that made it all worthwhile.  Here's Tyler taking a mini break: "

39563,b2kptbo,2007-02-24 23:46:00,1505,"Glad no one hurt and ya'all had a good time, thanks for the info..."
39569,irishfield,2007-02-25 00:00:00,26272,Thanks Clampet...at least we know whom Bowshep is now...we was teasin him during the prize dispersal about getting dressed in the dark this morning...with his two different shoes and all....
39572,ccmtcanada,2007-02-25 00:03:00,7971,"Hey Clampett!  It was great to see you again.  It sure was a great day out there...for a great cause, and it's always a bonus meeting up with other OFNers!"
39590,aniceguy,2007-02-25 00:49:00,1094,"A great day on the water for sure, and an even better cause thanks Maureen and others.   What struck me most was the food at the end of the day a simple donation or not and it was awsome to see that those that ate donated more then thier fair share, class act for sure.   3 km each way of walking on soft pack snow is sure hard on the body these days A few pictures of the day  Aaron Shirley after the long walk enjoying one of Tony's fine Cohiba's  I figure a  victory smoke for walking out to fish water where there were no foot prints at all other then our 3    I realized today that augers have yet another purpose, Tony sniping the Cohiba, when no one had a snip    Sorry I didnt meet all of you, but I must say I did meet some great ppl today, sadly no pics of me  Ohhh and a big thanks to the guy who handed me that green bottle of pop at the end of the day.........that was truly appreciated!!!!!!!!!!"

39644,douG,2007-02-25 02:31:00,2693,"Thanks for your report, Uncle Jed.  I'm still not bitter."

39861,tbayboy,2007-02-25 18:08:00,1497,"Not only was this my first OFC event but to witness the Tarpus Maximus in action - what an honour .  It was great getting to finally meet some of the names I see here a lot - well run event and a great job with the cooking guys - that burger hit the spot.  Also a big thanks to Lexx for taking a newbie like me out on the ice.  Was a nice day of lying back til I hear Lexx call out 'School' as he had the electronics then watch the lines pop (his more than mine but hey - I'm the newbie).  Sporting a bit of a sunburn and some sore arms today (gas augers - maybe not just a bad deal after all) but still glad I went.  Here a panarama I took around noon (click for the big picture):  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/401384224_7fc1b67aed_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""135"" alt=""SimcoeIce2007"" /></a>  Sean"
