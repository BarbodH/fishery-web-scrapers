Looking at the weather map, it looks like we're gonna start with a little snow, then change over to the nasty stuff ... sleet and freezing rain.  Looks like a mixed bag for us throughout all of today ... snow flurries tomorrow.  I am starting to wonder about that ground-hog that is about an hour north of me.  May want to be careful PF and give yourself some extra time.  Not sure what the forcast is for that area."
