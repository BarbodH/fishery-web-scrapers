39889,plkazoo,2007-02-25 19:39:00,8,We decided on a fly in trip in mid June using Air-dale service to either Fred Lake or Tony Lake near Wawa. Anyone have any experience on these lakes..or any other lakes in this area. Thanks. Pat

I've used Hawk Air, located directly across the lake from Air Dale many times over the years, with pretty much every trip being a success. If you want any specific info on their lakes shoot me a pm.  cheers , Mike"
