39551,irishfield,2007-02-24 23:14:00,26272,"Great seein you again Gerritt and all the others throughout the day. Since we were all fishin together I may as well add my pictures here in this thread. I too left home with less than 3 hours sleep...crawling out of a warm bed, with a warm women and asking myself ""what the hell are you doing""? Running into Joey and Tybo in the parking lot and getting my ""Joey hug"" reminded me of what it's all about. Good friends and good times. We headed out, after registering, and saying good morning to Ron/Cliff/Kelvin/Roger/JR/Maureen etc and started looking for the most dressed out ATV on the ice. This would lead us to last years champ Terry on the SPOT...and we found him...and I think he lied about the SPOT ! LOL  Here's Terry ready to dawn his metal helmut and lance...talking to Lady Walleye    Headhunter and Fishnsled    Joey and Gerritt    Cory and Heather came along and joined us early into the morning    Cliff and his little one..what an age to start out! Eager to fish and no whinning from this one..    Remo preparing for photoshop work..    Good seeing everyone/chatting back at the lunch/prize draw. Got to talk with most, but missed many I'm sure. Great seeing/talking with all those I did and hopefully will catch some of the other board members at future G2G'rs"
