39320,Hooked,2007-02-24 06:33:00,891,WOW!  You are a true Internet Guru Dan!  That looks like the Chuck from the Octagon days.  He was even badder back then then he is now.     Even with really bad pants.   Stellar work.

39471,Moosebunk,2007-02-24 19:20:00,3970,"I often set the hook on the tip-down by running over and giving the thing a good kick.  Now I surely will never miss a hookset again, and, I'll be looking real fashionable at a good price while I ice fish.  Thanks Dan.  You truly bring great things here to OFC. lol"
