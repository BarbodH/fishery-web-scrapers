39809,Handlebarz,2007-02-25 15:35:00,3790,I have to head over to CTC in a bit but think I might wait until the ice rain stops I shure am glad that I did not go fishing or to London today it is coming down in bucketts (not the white ones) and the van and truck is already getting covered in ice. Play safe and remember its heading east so if its not there yet have a backup plan for the day when it gets there.

We still  ( North of Sarnia ) have not had and precipitation as of 12:15PM but radar shows it still coming.  You made the right decision by staying home.  Although the show was in my estimation a good one by London standards, it's not worth risking an accident if you don't have to."
