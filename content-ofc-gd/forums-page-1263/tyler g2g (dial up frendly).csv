JR, and out on the lake we went. got to one spot found 45 feet of water, got the hut set up and got the rods down, almost instantly i got bit and pulled up a dink perch lol, went on with that for almost an hour, then the action slowed down.

39594,Greencoachdog,2007-02-25 01:05:00,8163,Yeah! I'd say that was a very dial-up friendly report!  Congrats on 3rd place!
39596,GbayGiant,2007-02-25 01:06:00,1780,"I bet that's the nicest looking 9"" perch you ever seen, congrats.  I was at a big ice tourney last year near Sudbury and the winner got a little pike but from second to 100th place were perch from 4-12"", I got some nice prizes for a 7"" perch, It can be tough some days.  Your fish looks like it ate a 8"" perch."

39649,Beans,2007-02-25 02:43:00,3339,After trudging my way out as far as the first hut I recognized Tinbanger and family and asked if there were any spare holes around...  Tinbanger and his guys/gal    not a bad pic considering I was sitting where I fell on my arse...thanks for a hand up Dave !...I managed to catch four dinky perch...  And here's the guy that all the noise was about...Tyler !!!...God bless him...    And here's my #1 grandson 23 year old Robert with his son (my great-grandson) Ryan James enjoying life on Chuck and Shelley's ATV    Great big KUDOS to all who participated and donated monies and prizes for this worthwhile cause and to those who did the legwork to make it the  success it was...made getting up at 03:00 AM worthwhile...

The 2 fish I caught last year (21"" laker & 9 1/2"" perch) would of been both 1st place winners this year. Last year not even close to winners.  Best Wishes to all: Rick"
