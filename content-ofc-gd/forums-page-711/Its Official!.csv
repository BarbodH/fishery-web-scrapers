445873,frozen-fire,2010-03-21 17:41:00,542,Saw quite a few robins around this weekend as well. Always a sign of spring

445981,ehg,2010-03-21 20:53:00,2666,"Sure was like spring around here last couple of weeks. Have not seen a robin yet, but did see a Snowy Owl for first time in west Toronto near the lakeshore. Bring on the softwater fishing"
445983,Twocoda,2010-03-21 21:00:00,4130,Those robins are a sight for sore eyes....
446021,young_one,2010-03-21 22:16:00,620,"Soon enough those robins will sing very loudly in the morning, my 6AM nature alarm. Follow by spring shower that leaves myself and the Robins to competing for the fattest worm."
446025,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-21 22:27:00,10439,"Hmmmmm, I haven't seen a single Robin yet this year.  Probably a little early for them up here, that and it was -30 last night!!!!"
