445464,Minnow,2010-03-19 16:18:00,177,"Hey Guys,  Got the small boat on the water for the first time this year and headed out for some early season action with my grandpa, and it felt great to hit some open water. Went to Dunnville and fished the Grand River yesterday hoping to hook into some monster cats! Got there pretty early and saw fish jumping so we immediately knew they were there but the low water levels, high current, and strong winds did not make for an easy day of fishing. We got 5 cats in total and the biggest one coming right before sunset near the dam. Will give it another week or so to go out again and maybe the water level will rise and the current will let up.      "
