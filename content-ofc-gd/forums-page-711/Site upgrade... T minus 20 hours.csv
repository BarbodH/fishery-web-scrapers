445297,bigfish1965,2010-03-19 03:40:00,3382,Remember that spouse that lives with you?? Time to get reacquainted! The site will be going down tomorrow. We will be ordering new parts and pieces and sticking them in. Could take as long as 48 hours to complete. I hope to have it all finished Sunday so I can go to the Sportsman Show.  Yes it will be new and there will be stuff we have not seen before. Lots of it. But the look will not change...much.  Here's the changes... Dropping of built in Gallery and Blog. Addition of integrated chat with a 'Who is chatting' box. More core changes to fit the community feel. New front page. Lots of geek stuff. Moving ads around... Cleaning up forums and sub-forums  New stuff TJ won't let me talk about...  Hope you guys like it

FYI, when i view this page using my Macbook and Safari, and open a thread with pics, i guess this message: ""SLOW SCRIPT"" and then the pictures don't load.  If you can address that, that'd be great.  But if not, that's okay, I'll continue using Firefox.  Thanks."
