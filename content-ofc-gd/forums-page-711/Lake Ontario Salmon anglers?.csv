446178,[emailÂ protected],2010-03-22 03:08:00,1,"eh I got no vessel but I am having a blast from the shore tryna hook up with those wary little buggers, I am talking the elusive chrome ones. Definitely beats playin video games all day like most boys my age.  Been skimming through this forum for a few months now, call me Forum shy, this will be my first post. Lake Ontario angler? I would call myself one & Wouldn't trade it for nothing.  My Tip: Just because your in a boat doesn't mean you cant yell to shore at the goldfish mongers loading up the vehicles with heinous amounts of our fish. I would recognize them as fishermen if they recognized what a limit was. Don't feel like a bad person for one second because I don't see anyone else doing anything about it."
446185,Handlebarz,2010-03-22 03:21:00,3790,Last year I tried it once it was fun even thought the weather was getting rough and we headed off early (gotta give respect to the big lakes) I was just talking to Slow Poke about hitting it in April i can not wait to get out there again. Hey Dax i might just have to tag along behind you this year

445192,fishdawg,2010-03-18 23:37:00,912,"Hey gang ive been a ""member"" here for quite a while & have gotten to know a few of you fairly well as to what your preffered styles of fishing are...  OFC has grown in members over the years, so I am just curious as to how many folks here take adavantage of Lake Ontario's open water salmon (& trout) fishery?  by far it has become my favourite over the last few years, though I will happily fish just about any other water body or method that southern Ontario has to offer"
445209,workwear,2010-03-19 00:00:00,592,we will be hitting the big  lake for the first time this year......should be a blast......any tips ??
445229,hookerdown,2010-03-19 00:36:00,110,"I love it... been fishing lake ontario for a few years now.... before i was strickly pike, bass and walleye... tied into my first salmon in 99 and been addicted ever since.  My biggest to date is over 27 lbs, and happly searching for my first tyee.  On a side note... my dad who is now 70, got into salmon fishing about 5 years ago, but prior to that just fished for the odd time... now he is the one asking my brother and me, when are we heading out next.  Needless to say he caught the bug and we all love it.  As you might of heard, a new club is starting in Port Credit, can't wait."
445230,Pigeontroller,2010-03-19 00:37:00,2793,"Yep, planning on fishing the Big Lake this Sat for the first time this year, I'll be trying to find some warm shallow water for Browns...   Just wish it(The Lake) was always friendly...  "
445235,raptorfan,2010-03-19 00:43:00,126,"I have wanted to fish in the open lake for a long time.  With a young family though, it is tough to afford a boat that will allow me to get out there, so for now I stick to the tribs.  Hopefully one year soon .  Love seeing all the pictures you guys post of the big kings and bows you pull out though.  When I was a teenager, we used to fish Lake Erie for pickeral, and I always had a great time there."
445237,HTHM,2010-03-19 00:46:00,4082,It's an atlantic.......
445252,Pigeontroller,2010-03-19 01:22:00,2793,Thats a Chinook...
445257,fishhunter,2010-03-19 01:32:00,604,Sorry to tell you thats a Chinook!
445261,Grimace,2010-03-19 01:43:00,2020,I love fishing for Salmon on Lake O.  Usually launch out of Bronte.  A nice Coho. 
445263,Joey,2010-03-19 01:47:00,9122,Paul and I also love fishing Lake O.  Great fishery and always a nice battle.  Half the fun is finding them  Joey
445280,John,2010-03-19 02:39:00,2956,This will be my first year out there so I will be learning the ropes................really looking forward to it.
445284,medmart,2010-03-19 02:58:00,587, Peter i have a tip for you leave Jose at home if you want to catch fish LOL
445292,Sinker,2010-03-19 03:27:00,8692,"Last summer was my first season out of my own boat out there. Previous to that, I spent time out there with friends and charters, learning the ropes. Im totally addicted now. If conditions allow it, I'm out there every time from May until hunting season.  I catch the odd fish too              S."
445312,John Bacon,2010-03-19 04:01:00,3277,I have only been out a few times; I primarily fish Baptiste.  I do plan to give it a try this year.
445315,perchslayer666,2010-03-19 04:08:00,280,Do you guys keep and eat these lake O fish? Just wondering... Great catches though!
445316,purekgw,2010-03-19 04:08:00,585,"we launch out of bronte almost every day my dad is off, usually start heading out at end of august didn't have a good year last year tho"
445363,fishhunter,2010-03-19 11:48:00,604,I'll second that lol
445366,fisher,2010-03-19 11:57:00,451,"I too used to fish mainly for Walleye, Pike, Bass, etc...on smaller lakes, but ever since I started trolling for Salmon out of Port Credit about 6 years ago, I say 90% of all my fishing is just that.  I guess it helps that I am only 1/2 hour away from the launch and that it is an awesome fishery.  And no, I don;t eat the fish out of Lake Ont. but many do.  Just check out the cleaning station at the launch and there are usually a few people fileting some fish (and many others waiting to take someone's fish that wasn;t able to be released successfully due to it being deeply hooked)."
445406,canadadude,2010-03-19 13:46:00,769,"If your interested in getting out now, the best spot is off Jordon Harbour, this area warms up first, there will not be many chinnok around yet but lots of browns and coho. I fish with boards in 8'-12' of water early morning and out to 20' later in the day, I don't go deeper this time of year. As for baits, I run J-9 or J-11 Rapalas with the 9's being the best producers for Brownies in this cold water, colour is not a big thing I've had 4 fish on at once on 4 different colours. The brownies will be in schools so if you hit 1 chances are another rod will pop right away. Another tip is to slow down 2mph max this time of year, there is a launch in behind the beacon restaurant drive out of the harbour and start trolling head west for about 2miles along the shore if you hit fish turn around and run through them again."
445412,GBW,2010-03-19 13:56:00,8460,"I try from shore as I don't have a boat at home, it's at the cottage and not big enough for lake O.  I even met up with memart one time..."
445479,LeXXington,2010-03-19 16:47:00,1928,I will be out a few times again this year. Last year I think I made it out 5-10 times the wind was always going the wrong way!!!  See you out there Dawg
445488,Terry,2010-03-19 17:12:00,14456, it sure is nice to have passed the gauntlet on to someone else
445515,Harrison,2010-03-19 18:54:00,2202,"I love fishing this time of year with the boards, not a huge fan of downrigging but do it when I can.  However my bro loves it."
445619,fishdawg,2010-03-19 22:36:00,912,"right on, good to see many like to spend time with Lady O  i run a fairly small boat myself for the big water,  just gotta pick safe days & use common sense"
445659,Sinker,2010-03-19 23:32:00,8692," Ditto that! Its not the boat that catches the fish. Pick your days and have atter. A lot of guys around my area think I'm nuts fishing Lake O in my boat, but I pick my days carefully, and try to be prepared for anything.  S."
