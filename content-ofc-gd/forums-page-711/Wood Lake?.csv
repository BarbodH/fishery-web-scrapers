445387,goteeboy,2010-03-19 12:40:00,175,"my friend has a cottage on there. i've fished it a couple times.  Tons of SMB and a good number of LMB around shore near structure.  He claims they have walleye but we've both never caught any.  It's a nice smaller lake.  lot's of shoreline, some good shallow weedy areas and some deeper spots.  the lake is too small to be a good boating lake."

The fishing was slow for us because we were not locals, but we still did manage to hook into smallies and largies on the lake. We actually had success on a local river for smallies as well.  I am not sure about the walleye as we were ill prepared to target them.  There was a small island on one end of the lake that we had success (I think the locals called it blueberry island) as well. All in all a nice place to cottage.  All the best with the purchase, everyone we met up with were very friendly and happy to help with fishing related questions. Some absolutely gorgeous cottages as well."
