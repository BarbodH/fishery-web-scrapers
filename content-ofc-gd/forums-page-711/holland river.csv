186539,PickerelHunter,2008-04-13 17:42:00,100,"I went there for the first time yesterday.  Everyone is in search of crappie, the bite didn't really pick up till later in the afternoon/evening from what I saw...although I left for a few hours because it was so crowded.  I saw a few people keeping everything they caught, and just checked the regs and it's a 30 crappie limit...would question the amount they had, but wasn't going to look through their pail obviously.  If you have a boat you'll do well for sure."
