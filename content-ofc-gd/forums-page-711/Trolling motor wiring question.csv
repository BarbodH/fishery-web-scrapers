445586,scugpg,2010-03-19 21:28:00,1373,"I have a 24v trolling motor that I run 2ga wire from the back of the boat to the front. From there it goes into a 10ga quickconnect and back into the motors original 6ga wiring.  I realize that going from 2 to 10ga probably isn't the best setup solder wise, but considering the 10ga run is like 8inches on + and - is this considered a bottleneck? Because the distance is so short?  Just wondering if I should be scrapping this and going to a plug setup or larger quick connect.  Thanks in advance."
445626,Big Cliff,2010-03-19 22:47:00,6899,What is the maximum current draw?
445629,Terry,2010-03-19 22:50:00,14456,I wouldn't use it  could get hot and start on fire  but also can make the motor work too hard and end it's life early
445632,Muskieman,2010-03-19 22:56:00,2472,"Use the same gauge wire back to front.... might cost you 30$ or so  but well worth the peace of mind. Looks better and and is ""fire free"" don't forget to include a AMP rated in-line fuse or relay.  Do it right do it once.  RFS "
445643,scugpg,2010-03-19 23:18:00,1373, I think around 40A. Already have the fuse covered but I'll see what I can track down for a new quick-connect.
445650,Sinker,2010-03-19 23:27:00,8692,"I don't understand why you need a quick connect?  Mine is wired front to back with 4ga. No plug, no quick connect. Fuse is about 10"" from my battery, and I've never blown it or had any problems.  S."
445654,irishfield,2010-03-19 23:29:00,26272,Motorguide wireless are not to be connected during charging. Also nice to be able to pop it off the boat for security or trailering cover install.
