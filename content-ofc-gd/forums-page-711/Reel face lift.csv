I love this reel and just can't seem to part with it, I feel it out performs alot of the newer reels out there on the market today. With that being said I'm looking for some helpful advice and tips on painting reels (baitcaster). If anyone out there has taken on such a project and might be able to assist me with some advice that would be greatly appreciated, Thanks in advance."

If all paintable parts are alloy or aluminum this works well. #1 clean as above. #2 strip old paint off with paint remover & re-clean with degreaser #3 slightly scuff desired parts with a Norton Red scuff pad. #4 apply 2 light coats of Zinc-Chromate primer #5 apply thin coat of automotive red or gray acrylic primer{depending on surface color} #6 wet sand with 2000 grit to a smooth surface #7 choose an automotive acrylic enamel finish @ CTC your preferred color . #8 apply two thin coats of chosen paint #9 repeat steps 6 and 8 x2 #10 go back to CTC for a can of Acrylic Enamel clear #11 repeat step 9 #12 apply a wet coat of clear. #13 let dry and re-assemble reel.  Worked for me.  RFS
