446153,Lunkerhunter,2010-03-22 01:59:00,455,  holy crap.. thats the reason i put the sled away early and walk out this time of year.  25 g's ... i couldnt imagine
446154,irishfield,2010-03-22 02:01:00,26272,I'm just taking a guess... sometimes they go into triple that from what I saw on their website.  Ice road is usually open for a couple more weeks or better up there. Ice out is usually first week of May.
446234,Jer,2010-03-22 10:44:00,1426,  Who says they were fishing?
446237,Bly,2010-03-22 10:48:00,1556,Ouch! I wasn't planning on driving on the ice anytime soon but thanks for the heads up.
446256,DanD,2010-03-22 12:04:00,2223,"Not sure if this has been asked before but I’m wondering what the environmental people have to say about these vehicles or any piece of motorized equipment, going through the ice? Battery acid, gasoline, motor oil, anti freeze, brake fluid, power steering fluid, transmission fluid, windshield washer; gear oil; not to mention the brake dust and the grime form years of driving. I never hear a whole lot of talk as to how this gets cleaned up, or is there a blind eye turned? Myself here at the shop (automotive repair) have to have signed contracts with recyclers to haul away my waist oils and anti freeze. Plus I must keep a monthly record of the floor drain’s oil separators, as to cleanliness and with who the contrast is with that cleans them. Man if we were to be caught allowing even a cup of anti freeze to hit the drains there’d be hell to pay. But like I asked we don’t hear anything about (for example) the 50-60 plus year old bombardier snow machines sitting on the bottom?  Other then we’re(hopefully)grateful that no one was hurt and the cost of getting them back to the surface? There’s nothing environmentally friendly about those PCB oozing, smoke blenching things; everything is vented to the atmosphere or the water in this scenario?  Dan."
446258,Billy Bob,2010-03-22 12:16:00,5865," The truck going through the ice is a ACCIDENT.....just like when two vehicles hit head on and all their fluids you described are spilled on the ground including anti-freeze, oil, gasoline, etc......"
446264,Carp,2010-03-22 12:36:00,1488,"We drive on L. Simcoe every winter and have been ever since I can remember, but when it starts to warm up, the trucks stays on shore. Running water finds its way through cracks in the ice and erodes the ice very quickly. I've see a 10 inch drilled hole (late season) double in size from running water in just a few hours, not to mention thinning the ice around the hole as well.  Call me a wimp if you must, but I'm a live wimp.     "
446502,moose,2010-03-22 20:38:00,266,there must be a special rider for insurance policy i no with aviva scottish anf york i had to sign a waiver for truck and atv that it is not covered or they wouldnt insure me
446508,archie_james_c,2010-03-22 20:51:00,618,"  Either way....substitute where I said ""hunt some fish"" with ""go for a drive"".  There is no set time of the year that is ""safe"" to venture on the ice until. You need to determine that yourself. obviously this is not a very good year weather-wise so maybe the trucks and sleds need to stay off the ice, or be much more cautious..."
446509,archie_james_c,2010-03-22 20:52:00,618,  Regardless thats a pretty penny! I wonder what the profit margin is like for a business like that!?

445681,tjsa,2010-03-20 00:11:00,1578,"One up here in the great white north on Lac Des Mille Lac is currently sitting in 30-40 ft. of water. He was trying to get close to another truck sinking when his broke through. Everybody is OK though, but I don't envy his bill to recover his truck."
445682,Terry,2010-03-20 00:13:00,14456,wow Pretty smart of someone to stick the wood under it
445686,irishfield,2010-03-20 00:16:00,26272, Both of these are on the ice road Terry.. were the ice was the thickest.. but of course first to go being bare !
445694,misfish,2010-03-20 00:26:00,29133,"Would one not think, with the milder then norm winter and  temps, think these thing could happen? The ice roads west of here are now closed too.  As you can see,the Ford made it.LOL  Long live FORD."
445700,Moosebunk,2010-03-20 00:33:00,3970,5 days earlier I was blowing donuts right there.  Guess they found the thin patch I burned.  lol.
445704,pike slayer,2010-03-20 00:44:00,1177,"i thank these brave souls for testing the safety of our ice with their expensive trucks, yous are true heros! thanks you!"
445705,tjsa,2010-03-20 00:47:00,1578,"wow, good timing, Dirty Jobs on the Discovery Channel has an episode on right now about recovering a vehicle that fell through the ice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
445712,Joey,2010-03-20 01:01:00,9122,"Isn't that first pic right on the way to your place Wayne?  Crap, that does not look good.  I hope he got out!!  Joey"
445714,irishfield,2010-03-20 01:05:00,26272,Nope.. down in the hub of the lake... right by the landing entrance to the lake from the access road.... nose of truck is sitting on bottom.  Yes he got out just before the nose went down... icefisherman that wasn't from the area.
445718,purekgw,2010-03-20 01:08:00,585,dodges dont swim to well
445728,moose,2010-03-20 01:13:00,266,was talking to rick and pauline ic eis 16 inches of candle ice wont be long at all for brakup but they are calling for 10-15 cm of snow tonight real carpy travelling
445731,irishfield,2010-03-20 01:14:00,26272,-13 tonight will tighten it up for anyone that needs to get off hopefully...

445754,HTHM,2010-03-20 01:57:00,4082,That cost me snootfull of beer on my keyboard! It was worth it!
445761,Dara,2010-03-20 02:07:00,3052,That ice sure looks black for driving around on. Oh well...I guess I'm just a chicken when it comes to that sort of thing.  We really don't have much ice for driving on around here to get used to it.  I bet somebody ended up with a load in their pants when it started to go down
445770,skeeter,2010-03-20 02:20:00,1907,  and i was told that this was a family board !!!!!!!!!!!!!    
445918,archie_james_c,2010-03-21 18:42:00,618,Hmm....March 17th in one of the warmest winters we've had in years....better take the truck out to hunt some fish.  Hope they were tasty.
445962,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-21 20:18:00,1362,Wow....and to think I was driving that same road 2 weeks ago
446035,smitter,2010-03-21 22:50:00,106,I don't think your insurance policy would cover something like that.
446131,irishfield,2010-03-22 01:21:00,26272, Actually.. it does. The ford was pulled out onto boards and driven away. The Dodge was pulled up the next day by Bartlets towing with their retrieval rack. Still a lot of ice there to hold the rack and truck..  http://www.ottertooth.com/Temagami/News/newsbriefs-101.htm#ma19
446138,fishhunter,2010-03-22 01:33:00,604,I could Tell last weekend that was going to happen . The ice road did not look good at all. We stayed off the ice road when we went up the lake. It was black and wet
446139,archie_james_c,2010-03-22 01:34:00,618,  Whats an operation like that cost?
446147,irishfield,2010-03-22 01:49:00,26272,That one was shallow and close to shore.. but I bet 20 hours.. 10 guys.. equipment... I'd guess 25 grand or so. Bartlets use to list the salvage costs on their website..
