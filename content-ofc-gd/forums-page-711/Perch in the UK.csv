However, over there they are a not seen as a prized fish and nobody really eats them. In fact if anything they are detrimental to the trout waters as they eat all the young trout. Anyways, I was saying that the perch over there get alot bigger than here in Canada and it got me searching on the internet and I found some images. Thought it may interest some, current British record is 5lb 12oz:    Overall they do get alot bigger than the fish over here:    Anyhoo, thought it might interest some people.  Dutchy"
