Took a little while to figger out what the little buggers wanted, but once we did.  WooHoo!   We kept 2 dozen as dinner guests out of the hundred odd caught.  I played camera man today. Didn't want to bust the lens on my mug  Going to go to sleep soon. No OFC for 2 nights had me bouncing off the walls."
