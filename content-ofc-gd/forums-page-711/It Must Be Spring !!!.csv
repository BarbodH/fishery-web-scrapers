First one broke me off, next one was a grandma hookset, lol, next one I landed and then a 10lb+ Brute broke me off just before I left.  Was a fun couple hours nonetheless.  Warm enough to get a few Jumps out of her  Even though she took me a couple minutes to get her in and 10 seconds for the pic,...she took almost no revival, took off like a bullet!!!  Lets let the wild ones swim  "
