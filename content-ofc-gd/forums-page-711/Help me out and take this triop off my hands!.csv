444770,fishhatemybait,2010-03-17 20:44:00,31,"Hey All,  A while back I got a great recommendation from a board member on where to stay for a trip to Nipissing. Namark Cottages. Unfortetunately, I have had to cancel my trip due to an unforseen work obligation. While I have been able to rebook with another operator (cosy cove cottages) I stand to lose my deposit if someone else doesn't take my dates.  I booked a 4 person cottage (called the Mark Cottage) for June 9-12. Including boat and motor for $470. This is one of the best deals I found around and the days are right in the middle of the best walley fishing on the lake. Can someone take my place? Let me know if you can take this off my hands. The number is 12396486256 and ask for Liz or terry Hyatt. If they are not at that number try 17057523125. Thanks guys. Hope some one can take the dates!  Chris"

445238,raptorfan,2010-03-19 00:46:00,126,I assume it is $470 per person?  Does that include meals and fuel for the boat as well?  Is the $470 based on 4 people?
445239,tightline,2010-03-19 00:46:00,322,"I tried to google search this place and came up with no info...shoot me a pm and a website, me and the boys are always lookin for a new adventure"
445290,Rizzo,2010-03-19 03:20:00,4754," if it was such a great recommendation why did you not book your other week with them? If they wouldn't let you cancel your first week, at least they might let you change it (especially since its still 3 months away!)"
445399,4thgen,2010-03-19 13:23:00,157,My first thought when I saw the title of this post:  
445422,ctdd2006,2010-03-19 14:15:00,531,"  I automatically assumed that ""other"" week was fully booked....not a crazy idea!"
445435,Rizzo,2010-03-19 14:52:00,4754,assume nothing...especially when someone has less than 10 postings
445544,fishhatemybait,2010-03-19 20:12:00,31,"Whoa! I'll try and get my postings up so you all can trust me! Anyway, some crucial info I left out. $470 is for a 4 bedroom cabin and 18 ft cedar strip with a 15hp for 3 days. That is the total cost. It is a good deal based on everything else I saw. I was planning on taking my 8 yr old son and 11 yr old nephew up. I could not book another time because tehy were full. Chris"
445551,dheitzner,2010-03-19 20:23:00,314,"Been to Nanmark, stayed with Terry & Liz, stellar operation. Chill out Rizzo."
445660,Radnine,2010-03-19 23:37:00,1538,"      Good points all. But it doesn't cost anything to communicate. If you walk like a duck and talk like a duck, people are going to call you a duck. Communication people!!! On a side note, if you are going to post something for sale, include a bloody picture!! If you are asking people to assume your liability (a deposit in this case) provide some details. Jim"
