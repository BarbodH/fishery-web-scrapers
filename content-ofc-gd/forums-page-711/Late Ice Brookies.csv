445484,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-19 17:03:00,0,"On Sunday I headed out with one of the usual suspects to chase some late winter square tails.  After a brief detour to ascertain some forgotten snowshoes, we were headed out of town by 5 am.  By 9 am we were fishing.  Things started off slow but true to form, this lake produced the first speck shortly after 10 am.    Fish were very selective in the early a.m. taking only jigged presentations tipped with minnows.  From 11 am until 1 pm fishing was fairly steady and we managed to ice several chunky fish - including a 2lber and a 3+ I lost fumbling with it at the hole.  Note to self, keep camera closer.        Throughout the day we had regular visitors...these whiskeyjacks kept stealing our lunch and bait...    It was a pretty good day.  Tomorrow is pinnin' for steel and ice fishing for brookies!  Good luck this weekend folks!"

445687,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-20 00:17:00,0, you mean the crowds don't hike 15km in a day by snowshoe to fish?

445709,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-20 00:55:00,0,"i don't know if any of y'all noticed, but i'm wearing my adidas.  not to often can you wear shoes in your snowshoes, then wear your kicks all day on the lake.  beauty day indeed wd."
445710,pike slayer,2010-03-20 00:59:00,1177,i wear my running shoes all winter in these http://www.overshoe.com/recreational/produ...tail.php?s=N5PS
445766,Dara,2010-03-20 02:15:00,3052,"  15 k or 15 yards, there just aren't the crowds up here. Most places, cept for haviland and trout lake, you get the lake to yourself  And don't be too sad about losing the 3 lber...they ain't all that good a eating anyway"
