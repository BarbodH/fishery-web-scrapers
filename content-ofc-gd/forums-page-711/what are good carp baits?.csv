444913,n8tivebigguy,2010-03-18 05:45:00,30,Hi i was just wondering what are good baits to use for carp fishing? I usually hook into 20 to 30 lbs carp with dew worms in the grand but was looking for different types of bait to try.  Thanks for any feedback.
444916,Marko,2010-03-18 07:45:00,854,"Corn, bread and boilies are probably 3 best baits"
444927,Paully,2010-03-18 10:32:00,712, That about sums it up!
444933,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-18 11:06:00,2050,"I've tried canned corn (whole kernels), boiling and mixing my own cows corn, corn cut strait from the cob, boilies and worms... for me worms are a last choice, not because they don't work, but because gobies and panfish usually pick it of your hook right away....  My first, and only choice is good old canned corn.  It's cheap, readily available, I use half the can as chum, and I haven't found a carp that isn't willing to eat it.  just my opinion!  Cheers, Ryan"
444935,PERCHER,2010-03-18 11:18:00,787,allways seem to do well with canned corn.Whole kernals not creamed.
444939,denisk,2010-03-18 11:45:00,163,"Green giant peaches and cream have the best kernels for hook bait, the dollar store and no name is good for chum.  Hominy (sp) is also awesome but sometimes hard to find.  Stick with dempsters canadian white bread it's like bagette for carp  Just watch out for the damn turtles    Believe it or not marshmellows were a good floating bait if you like to fish the surface bite    good luck!"
444951,Beans,2010-03-18 12:22:00,3339,I had good luck last year using Monster Maize from New World Carp Tackle on my hair rigs and used regular maize for chumming...
444953,FisherMike,2010-03-18 12:26:00,108,i like to make my own dough.  its very simple.  i just use 1 part corn meal and 1 part flour.  add some garlic salt and also kool aid powder.  combine it all in a bowl and add water.  unfortunately i never measure/weigh anything out so i cant give you exact amounts.  start off with a little water and then add more as needed.  it should end up being dryish on the outside.  if done right it is a really sticky dough and should stay on your hook for multiple casts.
444958,OhioFisherman,2010-03-18 12:38:00,6623,"Most of mine have eaten tubes, a bit of a different feeling between setting the hook on a 20 inch bass and a 40 inch carp. Guess they are fun to fight, lol and a lot less teeth than ski`s or pike? Those lips can be scary though!"
444964,dsn,2010-03-18 12:51:00,1018,"I normally use canned corn. Some brands will out perform others. Some are packed with just water, while other are soaked with its own juices. I use Green Giant. Some of the other brands the water or what they are canned with is white juice which is really water. The white juice is actually from the corn itself. The juices is what will attract a carp from a good distance off to your hooked bait.  But I have had problems with gobies attacking my kernels in heavily infested areas. You can actually see the bite marks or parts of the corn bitten off. When this happends I chum with canned corn and and with bollies. And I then rig up a bollie. Cause even though a bollie does have scent... its not strong as concentrated sweet corn juice which travels in the water  further.  Good Luck  DSN"
444970,bassjnkie,2010-03-18 13:06:00,1101,"#1 is Monster Maize from New World Carp, canned corn works well and boiled/favored field corn. Boilies work, but most of the time you have to introduce them in the area before you get a run."
445273,n8tivebigguy,2010-03-19 02:30:00,30,I heard of the boilies and tried them once but had no takers. I never knew you could use corn to catch carp and i might have to give it a try. Thanks for all the info guys.
445282,Weeds,2010-03-19 02:53:00,782,"I tried my hand last year at Carp fishing for the first time in ages, I had some luck using frozen corn. No Frills no name. If I remember correctly, and I seldom do, that the frozen corn niblets float, making them not so desirable, but if the bag thaws out I think they sink. The frozen corn is cheaper than canned  so you can throw alot of it around as chum. I'd squeeze 2 to 4 kernels on a Owner circle hook, maybe 2/0 or 3/0, and a half ounce to an ounce egg sinker on the line  and was ready to go."
445286,Mykester,2010-03-19 03:12:00,241,"My dad makes his own bait, it's a mix of flour, vanilla, corn syrup, and some other stuff."
445472,hammercarp,2010-03-19 16:33:00,964,These guys have given you some great baits to use for carp and I hope their answers help you out. The effectiveness of any of these baits is greatly enhanced if you fish them using the hair rig. Here is a link to a page that shows how to tie it. It is simple once you tie a couple. http://www.pleasurefishing.com/html/hairrigs.htm Good luck. If you get any Grand River carp please post them.
445721,denisk,2010-03-20 01:10:00,163,Fishing the hairrig and getting a run with your buzzer screaming when your half asleep is almost as good as a float dropping under a log while fishin steelies ALMOST
