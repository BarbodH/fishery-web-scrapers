Years past while up north were usually a little too uncomfortably cold for venturing out very often during the deep freeze winter period.  January and February here averaged two days a week on the ice, and although I wasn't able to really put the slay on too many fisheries, I did however learn a few tricks for myself and enjoy the help of others along the way.  Early season was all about back lake trout.  The fishing proved tougher than I had envisioned but the snowmobiling was out of this world.  With old and new friends joining me on most trips the commraderie bested the odd on ice skunking.      There were however... a few catches along the way.  This was a first inland bow for me caught on New Years Day, accompanying me had been Mangler, Fatluke and SM05.  Three guys I surely hope to ice fish with again.  The Capn RJ, my old buddy Keith, SM05 and I had been out together breaking trail middle of the month and it was during that exhausting bushwhacking tour that I nabbed my first speckle of the year.      These troutin' trips take a little more effort than most so during the month when I only had a little time to spare I snuck away for a few nearby panfish opps.  Again, all new fishing to me, I secretly enjoyed ""spring bobbers"" and gaining some early comfort with using the X67.  Best little outing had was when Leah joined me on the quad and we ripped over to see RJ, Kim, Phil and Len at the shack.  Leah really enjoyed perch during what might have been her first ice fishing experience.        February the game plan did change a little.  A group trip planned middle of the month for more back lake trout chances, fishing switched gears for the possibilities of bigger quarry.  Lakers and eyes.  Now, the lakers got my number... bigger ones anyways, but after witnessing RJ's mammoth Quinte eye during one outing where he really schooled a group of us, I had to get into some of these fish for myself.  Some tutilage first and some determination later, I made good on the return visit to the Bay jiggin' up what is a PB walleye and going 12 for 17 that February 9th day.            Two days later my pal Agent Stevie Zebco (of ""Mission Fishin' Impossible"" and ""K-Sawg's Big Pike"" fame) came down from the subarctic to join a large group of anglers at their annual fishing getaway.  A trip he and I look most forward to... top notch friends, fun, fishing and... riding.  StevieZ brought the tank for his bushwhacking.            Da FloatFishin'.        Da Tank and StevieZ    Came out the group trip and for the following 3 weeks got pounded by work.  A welcome change actually.  Did however manage one more fishing trip and a fishing related evening in the midst of that busy time.  End of the month RJ, Kim and I went down to Ottawa to join many others during a night set aside for fishing's biggest personality, the big hearted Big Jim.  Izumi and Mercer kept the group in stitches through the evening and afterwards Jim gave an emotional (but always upbeat) speech.  It was something really fun and eye opening to be a part of and there were moments I was taken aback really.  Great meeting a number of Fish-Hawkers there as well, and seeing some old faces too.  Before the month closed I took one more crack at them big eyes.  It wasn't one bit disappointing at all.  The BOQ pukered up a couple bigguns inbetween some smallins, and it was fun cleaning up that mess.          Alot of learning during January and February this year.  12 new bodies of water.  Fishing with a sonar and beginning to rely so heavily upon it.  Trying pannies, bows, splake and specks through the ice.  What I have to say can be the most trying thing at times is, the preparation before outings.  It's funny how accustomed one can become to days out which are familiar, but I personally found that because many trips were new it would take longer to do the preparation that usually comes second nature.  This would strangely lead to missed hours sleep at times, more time at Zog's, LeB's, seraching for minners, or just slowed moments due to overthinking or discombobulation during the days outing or prep times.  New experiences are great, but not all the time.  Most days when fishing it's nice to think only about fishing all the while feeling the surroundings, I hope more experiences here take me closer to that familiar and peaceful place again.  Some Northern Exposure soon might just be the anecdote.  Ice season isn't over yet."

Spent the evening tonight filling in about 2 dozen holes on the property so that oughtta help smoothen my summer riding.  Say hello to Leah for me Wayne.  Thanks doods.  Come monday I'll be offline for about a month but hope to have something to report come March.  Good fishing all."
