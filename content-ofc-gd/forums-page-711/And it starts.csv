445613,misfish,2010-03-19 22:25:00,29133,"Reports coming in that, 4 people are being rescued out near Georginia island.  Just wait a bit more,the open water will be here soon enough."
445628,Big Cliff,2010-03-19 22:48:00,6899,"Two dogs broke through the ice on Pigeon Lake last week, I'm not taking the chance!"
445630,lowerunit,2010-03-19 22:55:00,53,"There were four wind surfers rescued in Cooks Bay  tonight. Looks like five of them were out there and four went through. South of Glenwoods in front of the marina, dont know the name of it looks like it just changed ownership."
445646,cheaptackle,2010-03-19 23:22:00,849,"Caught the tail end of the Barrie news showing the rescue - 3 are ok, think they said one was air lifted to hospital.  Showed the air boat in action along with the rescue team.  Good thing they exist!  Michael"
445649,vinnimon,2010-03-19 23:27:00,2593,How desperate do people have to be to take a chance on their own lives?
445661,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-19 23:38:00,3761,"Haha, why the hell would people be out when we have had a week of +5 degree weather with the last 2 days over 15 degrees in some places....im 18 and smarter than some of those dummies out on the ice haha(as long as they don't die...)"
445679,misfish,2010-03-20 00:06:00,29133," Not sure ""HAHA"" is called for Mike.Ya some people make bad judgements.Hope all turns out alright for the fella that was airlifted.  I was thinking about trying my pike grounds this weekend,but from what I seen today,not a chance. The bay is black and the ice will be gone in a week."
445680,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-20 00:11:00,3761,"Your right, I just find it funny that ice fishermen or locals would tempt the ice after such warm weather."
445707,pike slayer,2010-03-20 00:53:00,1177,sooo stupid all you can do is laugh and shake your head right mike?
446050,Jigger,2010-03-21 23:09:00,1237,"I took a day trip to Haliburton today. LOTS more open water then I expected to see at this time of year. No-one out on the ice. If theres current, the ice is going fast. The smaller landlocked puddles are still froze up to the shore, but the bigger lakes won't take long to go out. About a month early and LOW water levels. Got me thinking about the boat though!"
446243,Jer,2010-03-22 10:57:00,1426,"I fired my boat up in the driveway this weekend.  Ready for the ice-out and early season crappie fishing. Parts of Pigeon look to be almost ice free, won't be long..."
446246,Handlebarz,2010-03-22 11:08:00,3790,Dang ice ours has been gone for two or three weeks now heck the boats have been fishing the Detroit river for all of two weeks if not longer
