If your signature line excedes the following criteria would you please make the necessary modifications to meet the parameters outlined.  From the Rules....  ""One image in a signature is allowed. Images in signatures must not be greater than 500 pixels wide and 75 pixels in height. Signature images must not be more than 100K in file size. Signatures must also conform to language and content guidelines.  Please keep signature lines brief, a line or two of text is fine. No lists!""  Image Size Example     While we appreciate the work involved in creating unique signature images and text it is important to not let them become the focus of your posts. Think small.  Thank you."
