443996,phiphntek,2010-03-15 14:10:00,115,can't find em here in St.Kitts and this thread is making me hungry !!
444016,blaque,2010-03-15 15:55:00,2419, Ill take an oscar meyer over a sahlens any day of the week. I like them boiled over grilled as well.
444026,JohnF,2010-03-15 16:15:00,3494,I'd be happy to give y'all an account of my experience making weenies at the packing plant when I was a kid. Made bologna and sausage too.  JF
444038,ketchenany,2010-03-15 16:36:00,3229,"  Jhon, are you going to tell us what's NOT in it? Let's start with meat . . ."
444040,JohnF,2010-03-15 16:45:00,3494, By meat do you mean animal parts???  JF
444042,Billy Bob,2010-03-15 17:00:00,5865, Sir: you need help ASAP.....have you ever seeked or considered consulling....
444294,Jonny,2010-03-16 05:17:00,1380,"For store-bought beans, Clark's Pork and Beans ARE the Cadillac of beans! You need look no further.  If you can't get those (they can be hard to find at times around here) then Metro ""Selection"" Pork and Beans make an admirable substitute.  I've had Bush's beans. They're just OK."
444295,Jonny,2010-03-16 05:43:00,1380,"if you're a bean lover, this recipe is guaranteed to knock your socks off...  Bean Bake  1 lb hamburger 1 1/2 c  onion - diced 1 tbsp oil 1 can kidney beans - drained 1 can “bean medley” (mixed beans) - drained 1 can pork and beans (Clark’s preferred) ½ c hickory BBQ sauce (Walmart “Original Bold” is good) 2 tsp prepared mustard ¼ c brown sugar 1 tbsp vinegar ¼ tsp salt 1/8 tsp pepper  In a large cooking pot, heat oil, then scramble fry hamburger and onion until onion is soft and hamburger is no longer pink. Drain. Add all beans. Mix mustard, brown sugar, bbq sauce, vinegar, salt and pepper in a measuring cup, then stir into bean mixture. Turn the entire mixture into a casserole with cover, or a small covered roast pan. Bake in a 350* oven for 1 hour.  You can stretch this recipe a bit by adding 2 cans of pork and beans instead of 1. Still just as good."
444305,solopaddler,2010-03-16 09:31:00,8605," Heresy! Clark's don't hold a candle to Bush's! What, are your taste buds dead man?"
444322,Billy Bob,2010-03-16 11:49:00,5865,Bush has about 7-10 different varieties of their beans....it's not hard to find one you love.
444369,Jonny,2010-03-16 14:52:00,1380," Ah, the old level-wind vs. spinning conundrum.  At an evening camp-fire, after a few bottles of beer, they would both taste heavenly.  Especially with some fire-roasted wienies chopped in, and buttered bread!"
444382,JohnF,2010-03-16 16:04:00,3494, That's why woodsmoke was invented - to cover the smell of beer & beans.  JF
444387,dave524,2010-03-16 16:26:00,4508,"I'm not too fussy on brands, I take about 3 cans, dice an onion real fine, tablespoon of molasses, table spoon dijon mustard, chop up some weinies, mix it all in a casserole dish and bake in the oven. Worth the extra time."
444394,Jonny,2010-03-16 16:36:00,1380," Unless you're a blessed with the olfactory numbness of a Ralph Cramden, it's in the tent afterwards when you really suffer the effects. "
444404,Fang,2010-03-16 17:03:00,1330,"When on shopping trips to Buffalo with the family, one stop I always make is inot the Topps right beside Gander Mountain. Bush Beans are sooooo gooood!!! Eat em cold right out of the can!  Still have 2 cans sitting on my shelf at home but will look for them a wallyland."
444511,Syn,2010-03-16 23:57:00,519,Awesome! Now I can use my bread gloves for scooping beans from a large bowl.  
444514,Daplumma,2010-03-17 00:05:00,1961,Beanie wienies are a something you have to try before you die. Joe
444518,camillj,2010-03-17 00:31:00,1988,Rrrrolll that beautiful bean footage !  
444658,blaque,2010-03-17 14:29:00,2419, Ya i know.........i get funny looks all the time when i go to Teds and ask if they have any oscar meyers LOL  Ill take a johnsonville beer brat or cheddar brat over any hot dog as well
444662,Billy Bob,2010-03-17 14:41:00,5865,Personally I like hot dogs and Sahlen's are the best but when push comes to shove I love a good Italian sausage better...
444722,blaque,2010-03-17 17:59:00,2419, Mineo and Sapio??
444769,douG,2010-03-17 20:34:00,2693,Whistle Berries.
445468,Jonny,2010-03-19 16:22:00,1380,Any more word on those Bush's beans at Canadian Walmarts?  I wouldn't mind giving them a try again.
445627,tonka-toy,2010-03-19 22:47:00,139,"I just got back from Walmart at eglington and Warden. They had a display at the front of the store,2/$2.The cans are smaller (388ml)than the ones I get from the states but will do just fine. The ladie who pointed me in the right direction said she doesn't think they will be carrying them normally ,just from time to time."
443251,tonka-toy,2010-03-13 05:02:00,139,"Heard a rumour that at least half a dozen members I know will be interested in... Bush's  Beans now available at Wall Mart - I'll be cleaning out the Scarborough location shortly after they open tomorrow!!  If you've never tried them and like beans give them a try,  you'll understand why people will go to great lengths to bring them up here from the states. Just thought I'd share."
443252,richyb,2010-03-13 05:03:00,774,what the hell are bush beans ?
443254,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-13 05:09:00,10439,  Dang fine baked beans!!!  Bush's Beans!!!!
443255,tonka-toy,2010-03-13 05:12:00,139," When another OFC member first told me about them and let me sample them, I thought he might be on crack the way he was going on about his beans..couple of bites in I thought maybe they put crack in them and maybe that's why they taste so good. For the past ten years anyone I know going to the States HAS to bring me back a case!!"
443270,Gerritt,2010-03-13 11:42:00,6129,they are great!
443285,solopaddler,2010-03-13 12:20:00,8605,HA! That's funny I thought I was the only one. When I remember I always try and grab a few cans when I head Stateside. Been doing it for years...
443286,OhioFisherman,2010-03-13 12:22:00,6623,"LOL we have something Canadians like besides a bit of warmer weather in the winter? LOL, don`t ever say America doesn`t sell you gas! A common brand name here in the Medina Ohio area, all the major grocery stores stock it and in a few flavors. Actually a brand that no longer seems to exist Heartland were my favorite."
443294,Calender Don,2010-03-13 13:03:00,39,"If you want bush bean why not go to a seed company, William Dam Seeds they have been around for 61 years and are here in Ontario and there open to the public in Hamilton about 10 min from the 403 you can call them up and order them. they have a web site   hxxp://www.damseeds.ca/productcart/pc/viewCategories.asp?idCategory=170   you can copy the link but you have to change the ""hxxp"" to http that should take you there."
443299,Beans,2010-03-13 13:15:00,3339,I've never tried them but I always thought Clarke's Beans were the Cadillac of baked beans !
443331,Paully,2010-03-13 15:34:00,712,Beans beans the magical fruit the more you eat the more you toot!
443343,Beans,2010-03-13 15:59:00,3339," LOL...I taught a grandson..  Tea, tea,...makes you pee...down your leg and over your knee...  His nursery school teacher asked him who taught him that and he said his DAD..."
443370,tb4me,2010-03-13 16:47:00,3295,I too use WD seeds! Have for almost 25 yrs now. I used to live on the 2nd connsession just around th ecorner from them..Great place for seeds however this post is about baked beans. Wich IMO my hommade ones are the best!!
443374,JohnF,2010-03-13 16:55:00,3494,"I'll never get to try them. One of my many many shortcomings is having a brain like a sieve, so I have to ask my wife to remind me about things I'd like to buy the next time I'm in the States.  There's no way she's ever gonna remind me to buy beans, not in this lifetime.  JF"
443380,douG,2010-03-13 17:06:00,2693,"I like making baked beans too.  Plenty of bacon, diced tomatoes, onion, garlic.  Molasses, dijon mustard, chicken stock, thyme, and cook em slow.  Maybe a drop or two of liquid smoke and some crushed chili flakes.  I like mixing the bean varieties, with black beans, black eyed beans, pintos and bostons.  Serve em with some cheese, pickles, and fresh bread, wash it all down with a good ale."
443388,Spiel,2010-03-13 17:26:00,9065, Sounds like the perfect icebungalow meal for six Doug. Just saying.
443391,Tybo,2010-03-13 17:31:00,1373,Nice Fish!
443404,bigugli,2010-03-13 17:43:00,6138,"Gotta love beans.. I prefer my maple syrup beans any day, cold, right out of the can.  Like douG, I really like a solid bean casserole, Hawaiian style with a few types of beans, onion, garlic, bacon or ham, pineapple, diced peppers.  WARNING!! No more than 4 partakers of said repast shpuld be allowed to occupy the same building, let alone a tent or ice hut"
443641,tributaryhunter,2010-03-14 07:29:00,108,"brought them on the trout opener last year, and lets just say they were excellent, exspecially when three crazy guys eat them and later the sound of music begins for awhile"
443715,Backlash,2010-03-14 15:58:00,17,"Have been buying them for years,was in Boston in the fall and bought 3 cases from Walmart,best beans around, if you haven't tried them give them a try! Thanks for info Tonka-Toy  Backlash"
443854,tonka-toy,2010-03-14 23:46:00,139,"Went to Morninside location today, no fargin bush's beans. My source said they saw them at Warden and Eglinton, may check tomorrow."
443856,SBCregal,2010-03-14 23:52:00,688,didn't see any at the one on fairview in burlington either
443882,blue pickeral,2010-03-15 01:03:00,267,"Good topic - if you want to have a magical day around the camp in the winter, or in cool weather, bake yourself up a batch of home made beans (I got started by using the recipe on the back of the Thompson white pea beans package and 'adapting' later - favourite addition Kraft Brown Sugar barbeque sauce) and at the same time use Guy Fiero's (sp?) (chef  with the spikey blond hair) pulled pork recipe. You can find it on the American version of the Food Channel web site. Both cook at the same temperature - the beans about 8 hours, the pulled pork about 10, but the cooking aroma is wonderful as is the eating!"
443887,Billy Bob,2010-03-15 01:13:00,5865,"Wow,  didn't know you can't get Bush Beans in Canada....a staple here in my house....GREAT with a fish fry....Sam's Club carries Bush Beans but only the original kind where Walmart or Tops or Wegman's has the several other flavors that Bush makes....my favorite is the Country Style.......one last thing.....get yourself some FRANK'S Hot Sauce to spice the beans up....this is the same hot sauce that has made the Famous Buffalo Chicken Wings to what they are today..."
443979,blaque,2010-03-15 13:05:00,2419,"Hmmmm, not a big bake bean fan........never knew i had such a great recipe readily available to me though lol. Maybe ill try them over the summer while grilling.  My favorite as a kid was Cambells Franks and Beans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  As far as Franks.........i thought that was pretty widespread until i was tellin my boss (from Rochester) that i use Franks for a recipe and he said..........""Ok, so now whats the Franks"". I thought he was joking."
443986,Billy Bob,2010-03-15 13:26:00,5865,"Franks, Wieners or Hot Dogs all the same but none can hold a candle to the BEST BUFFALO has to offer.......Sahlen's Hot Dogs....once you have this hot dog all the rest are just dogs. MANY folks that move away from here have friends and relatives send them to Sahlen's for the summer."
