445116,Terry,2010-03-18 20:32:00,14456,"As stated great customer service I made a cast with my Symetre 1500RI reel and the line  quit coming off the reel I noticed the end cap thingy that holds the spool on was missing, must be in the drink  I asked about it at a tackle store and got no where I emailed Shimano and asked where I could get  a new part and what the name of the part was well they didn't tell me what the name of it was, but they did say thanks for being a customer, a new part is in the mail A week later it arrived free... now that is truly a great  way to keep people happy and coming back when it's time to buy more equipment  thanks Shimano.... if a few more companies could step up like that, things would be great Terry"
445118,troutologist,2010-03-18 20:36:00,951,"Its amazing that things like this are not par for the course, especially in a market like fishing reels, many brands offering very similar products, its how they stand behind them when something goes wrong.   Glad it work out for you Terry. My experiences with Shimano have been the same."
445138,bridge,2010-03-18 21:26:00,54,Glad to here that about Shimano.  I've emailed Okuma twice in the last 8 days about a reel.  So far I've heard nothing from them.
