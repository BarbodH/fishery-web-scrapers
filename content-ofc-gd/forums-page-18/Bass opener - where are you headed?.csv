1074176,AKRISONER,2021-06-21 21:01:00,5558,"is that the same as the guys that buy a boston whaler to catch a fish you can catch by simply driving your boat around with your rod in a rod holder? I often get identified as a ""bass guy"" cause I drive a bass boat and fish tournaments, but with the limited bass season it sure as heck leaves me a heck of a lot of months to target other stuff. I truthfully try and do it all because it makes you a more rounded fisherman and theres just a lot of ""prime times"" to check off that make for some good fishing, but if you think flipping heavy cover and skipping docks is less entertaining then jigging up walleye I dont know what to tell you lol. Im not hating on walleye fishing either because I spend 2 months of the year specifically fishing them. By the way musky guys...i fish musky too lol and you fly guys...yup i do that too (although not well)"
1074178,BillM,2021-06-21 23:25:00,17367,Walleye guys probably catch more muskie then the idiots like me out fishing for them
1074276,Sinker,2021-06-24 19:33:00,8692,"Yeah, but how many 45"" muskies do you think most people catch in a season? Its about the chase.  Like you said, I can sit on my dock, or any bridge and catch bass all day long. At the end of the day, i fish for everything. I just don't get excited over bass. I might fish them once or twice a season. S."
1074277,AKRISONER,2021-06-24 19:55:00,5558,I wish… i can’t seem to catch them any time I fish 🤣
1074279,porkpie,2021-06-24 22:10:00,2521,"All good pal, I’m just having fun with ya!  I seldom fish for the green carp either!"
1074281,pics,2021-06-24 23:31:00,1268,I was out on Long Point recently and I watched a couple in a Bass boat fishing for pike as if they were in a Bass tourney.  It was comical the way they weaved in and out of the anchored pack . The guy even did the old lay on his back and reach behind him to land a fish. Must be practice for when the season opens. At which time they will do the same routine but the anchored tri-hull boats will be using minnows and the bass will be going right into their cooler or on a stringer..
1074291,pics,2021-06-25 21:23:00,1268,I actually like fishing for bass on lake Erie when the winds are calm.. there's nothing like watching a big bass chase your jig 20 feet below the surface..
1074295,BillM,2021-06-26 02:22:00,17367,"Nowhere, 50-100mm of rain in the forecast.    Bass can wait, lol."
1074296,AKRISONER,2021-06-26 02:47:00,5558,Sounds like there’s going to be a break in the rain for tomorrow morning into the afternoon before the deluge begins…I’m hoping the weather man is right!
1074297,bobowski,2021-06-26 02:54:00,360,Me too man. I'm all set to go out in my $1 store poncho. Lol
1074299,AKRISONER,2021-06-26 08:55:00,5558,No lie…it’s shaping up to be a goretex type of weekend lollll im most upset about the fact that my stupid boat makes changing a bilge nearly impossible without ripping all of the batteries and wiring out. I don’t have an auto bilge in my boat and with the rain warning now up for tonight into tomorrow I guess it means I gotta constantly throw my boat in and out of the water. tight lines and good luck to anyone headed out this morning! I’m on my way out.
1074105,AKRISONER,2021-06-17 14:48:00,5558,"It’s the most wonderful time of the yeareerrrrereerrr forecast looks ok….rain seems to have backed off, gonna be windy though. Might make it a bit tougher for the guys wanting to find some of those still bedded fish. me personally, I’m fishing a friends derby on the tri lakes, put a bit of cash down, fish all day, come back eat some steaks drink some beer and shoot the poop cant frigging wait, I’m already out in the driveway, re-cleaning the boat lol head up tomorrow, rig rods and make final preparations. For zone 14 next Saturday, it’s my first opener at the new place. Done a very minor amount of scouting while laketrout and pike fishing. Haven’t seen a bass yet, but I have and idea of where they will be. I’m up there for 10 straight days so I should start figuring something out by weeks end. It’s been a number of years since I’ve had a totally blank slate and didn’t just go to my favourite honey hole to throw topwater on opener morning. I’m most excited to see if I can find some largemouth though, I’ve looked at some Satellite photos and have come up with some ideas, but I haven’t seen the areas in person. did a ton of work on the boat over the winter, I’ve used it laketrout fishing but I’m extra excited to see how things run up on the grass and on the shoals! where are you headed? "

1074132,Sinker,2021-06-18 13:57:00,8692,"Coming from the bass guy whos making a post asking where everyone is going fishing haha....... I just don't get whats so attractive about fishing for fish, that a 5lber is a tank. ......  S."
1074133,AKRISONER,2021-06-18 14:04:00,5558,"That’s how most musky days end lol especially on g bay  sinker…I can’t tell you the number of days I’ve fished musky on g bay and I’ve still never caught a big one hahahaa that’s why  saturday, running the boat wide open, money on the line, 5 fish….there’s nothing better"
1074134,mamona,2021-06-18 14:15:00,597,"I am so pumped for the season. Still need to wait 1 week more, 15, 14, 16 open next weekend"
1074137,misfish,2021-06-18 16:23:00,29133,Water is still cold enough for whites. 😁

1074164,bobowski,2021-06-21 12:03:00,360,I'll be on Gbay starting this Saturday for multiple days chasing the bucket mouths. Can't wait.
1074166,AKRISONER,2021-06-21 12:53:00,5558,What part? I’ll see you out there? I’ll be around the big sound
1074167,bobowski,2021-06-21 13:27:00,360,I'll be a lot more south than that. I'll be in the port Severn area.
1074169,AKRISONER,2021-06-21 15:14:00,5558,"love fishing that area of the lake. Only went for the first time last year but its awesome...especially with teh higher water levels. Shes down 2 feet this year so things will be a lot different with it not so flooded but still excellent fishing. Reminds me of the tri-lakes, but with georgian bay smallmouth nearby. Really cool stuff."
1074170,porkpie,2021-06-21 15:51:00,2521,"I hear you, its sort of like reeling in a 45 inch musky on 80lb test.  49 seconds from hooked to in the net.  I tell ya, fun times.  Makes for a better photo though 😂"
1074172,BillM,2021-06-21 17:13:00,17367,Saw 62 degrees out in the big water near Honey Harbour on Sunday.   Will be interesting to see what the bass are doing come the weekend.
1074173,AKRISONER,2021-06-21 18:07:00,5558,The water everywhere is so surprisingly cool and I have no idea how considering the heat we have had this spring.
1074174,pics,2021-06-21 20:37:00,1268,I love these comments.. personally I'm not a Bass guy and I think some of the Bass guys are crazy spending 6 figures to catch a fish that a little kid on a dock could get but to each their own.. have fun and stay safe..
1074175,lew,2021-06-21 20:43:00,12766,Funniest comment of the year 😁😁
