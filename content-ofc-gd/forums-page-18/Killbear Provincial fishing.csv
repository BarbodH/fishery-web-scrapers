1074632,UpliftAura,2021-07-06 16:34:00,7,Heading to Killbear in a few days for my birthday but from everything I’ve read the fishing there isn’t great but that’s all from years ago. Anyone been there recently and had any luck? Thanks.

1074634,UpliftAura,2021-07-06 16:45:00,7,Alright thanks! I wasn’t planning on trout fishing so that shouldn’t be a problem anyway.
1074637,AKRISONER,2021-07-06 17:42:00,5558,"Theres good fishing, just not for walleye or musky. Lots of dead water for sure, but when you find them its good."
1074639,UpliftAura,2021-07-06 18:15:00,7,What is dead water? I’ve heard that term before but not sure what it means.
1074647,OMCDinosaur,2021-07-06 22:14:00,18,"From Killbear, you can boat following the channel north towards snug harbour area.  Sheltered boating, as you aren't on the main bay.  follow channel north to cormican bay area outflow,  dynamite bay to the south for pike, smallmouth at both bay outflows.  Caught lakers smallies and Pike in that area.   Largest was a 39"" Northern on an ultralight.   Didn't find any walleye, and also didn't go onto the main bay.   You can keep a laker from waters n of snug harbour lighthouse I believe.  We've fished this area for about 20 years now. Wifey pulled a 12.5 lb natural laker there at May walleye opener weekend, cpl years ago.   Hydrographic charts are my go to.  Don't have a phone or advanced electronics, just a comapass and ruler, the charts are excellent, although some of the shorline lineup sign aids have been removed, be careful."
1074648,aplumma,2021-07-06 23:08:00,6896,"Fish relate to many factors and finding two or more of them will be considered productive water meaning there are fish there to catch if they are feeding. Dead water is where you have one or less factors and no fish are in the area. It could be no structure, wrong temperature, no weed lines, or other factors. Every place and species have their preference as to where they are comfortable.  Art"
1074654,UpliftAura,2021-07-07 00:27:00,7,Alright that’s awesome thanks for the tips
1074655,AKRISONER,2021-07-07 02:23:00,5558,"Exactly, and even then sometimes you will see areas that seemingly should be holding fish, but alas, you fish it and get skunked. I’ve learned on g bay, if you aren’t getting bit, keep moving. When you find fish, fish the area well."
