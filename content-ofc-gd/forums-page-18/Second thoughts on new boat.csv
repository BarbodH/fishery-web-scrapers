1074375,bigcreekdad,2021-06-28 21:36:00,546,"I am obviously crazy. Spent a ton of time seeing what was available, pricing and researching them....even getting opinions from many of you. So, yesterday, decision made. Chose Crestliner. Put a deposit down, and made arrangements to drive the 2 plus hours on Wednesday to drop my boat off (1998 Alumacraft Magnum 165T). Dealer is installing my Yam 60 4stroke on the new boat, and buying my boat. Today, I was cleaning out my old boat, and decided to go fishing for a few hours. All the time fishing (lousy fishing btw, and embedded a damn hook in my left index finger) I a looking over the Magnum....seems pretty damn comfortable, still rides great, fishes just fine, etc. So, I start feeling stupid, and kinda bad, about getting rid of a 20+ year fishing partner that still functions quite well. Actually, ended up a little depressed, and started to think of cancelling the sale. Anyone ever go through this? Sniff.  "
1074376,glen,2021-06-28 21:53:00,2641,Iâ€™ve had the same boat for 35 years.
1074377,bushart,2021-06-28 21:59:00,2628,Bought my Smokercraft 1n 1996 one of the 1st Merc 4 strokers on it Still on the water and catchin more fish than Jonah And yes ---I am a huge Smokercraft fan---and have fished outta many Lunds and Crestliners
1074378,lew,2021-06-28 22:30:00,12766,Take a picture of the Alumacraft and hang it in your garage. Go buy the Crestliner and enjoy the new boat and all it has to offer.
1074383,bigcreekdad,2021-06-29 01:18:00,546,Lew...you are a wonderful man. Too bad we never met. 
1074385,Hack_Fisherman,2021-06-29 02:37:00,720,Look at it as a new chapter. Book is not over yet. Enjoy the hell out of the new one
1074388,lew,2021-06-29 08:58:00,12766,Thank You
1074420,akaShag,2021-06-29 20:04:00,2073,"A bit of grief, or nostalgia, is not a bad thing.Â  But think of the adventures and stories you will have with your NEW boat!Â  You don't get very far ahead if you are looking in the rear-view mirror............. Doug"
1074425,porkpie,2021-06-29 22:30:00,2521,"The boat in my driveway currently is the longest Iâ€™ve ever owned one other than my old Lund SSV.Â Trucks and cars I keep a long timeÂ Â but boats I seem to like horse trading for some reason. Â Sure enough I just got this one exactly where I want it and I started thinking about making some corona money and ordering a new one from the dealer. Â Fact is I need my boat as we have too much going on this summer for me to sell it, but the thought lingers LOL. Â Enjoy the new boat, itâ€™s always a nice feeling!"
1074449,bigcreekdad,2021-06-30 11:58:00,546,Done deal.....closed the deal yesterday.
1074451,akaShag,2021-06-30 12:21:00,2073,One door closes and another one opens..............and damn you!!!Â  Now you got me thinking it might be time to get a new boat as well.Â  It doesn't help that my outboard had an issue just before bass season and is at the sick motor doctor awaiting parts.............ðŸ™„
1074458,bigcreekdad,2021-06-30 14:01:00,546,Shag...go for it! I have no idea how I lasted 22 years.
1074467,akaShag,2021-06-30 15:32:00,2073,"Mine's a 1998, very sweet, does everything I need, and it's PAID FOR. But those two finalists you were looking at are mighty fine looking boats! Doug"
1074469,Rattletrap2,2021-06-30 15:37:00,1652,"bigcreekdad, is your 60 hp YanahaÂ motor a 1998 as well? If so, that is where I would have wanted the update more than the boat."
1074472,bigcreekdad,2021-06-30 17:15:00,546,"Trap....no, the Yamaha is 2008"
1074492,OMCDinosaur,2021-07-01 12:28:00,18,"Imma gonna nurse my 1975 70 hp Evinrude until I can rebuild my 1987 Johnson 70 hp (unfortunate lending experience) then enjoy the fresh 70 until the gas engine ban in 2035 something.... 14 years to go LOL.Â  Â They'll stop selling tcw-3 in 10 years, btw...A very unceremonius death to 2 stroke boating last year.Â  I'm too old to let go."
1074493,Hack_Fisherman,2021-07-01 12:39:00,720,"enjoy the fresh 70 until the gas engine ban in 2035 something.... 14 years to go LOL.Â  Â They'll stop selling tcw-3 in 10 years, btw  Huh?"
1074499,OMCDinosaur,2021-07-01 13:15:00,18,"Evolution... usually emission standards etc. are set by gov't, and industry evolves, you didn't notice the death of 2 stroke outboards? gov't didn't have to legislate it...brp killed it.Â  no maker has a foot in the game 2 cycle hence NO MORE 2 cycle outboards.Â  very quickly will availability of basic supplies evaporate.Â  Â Hell, mercury carb kits for post EPA carbs (y'know the ones in the 4 strokes) no longer come with idle mix needles.Â  Don't know about Honda's as they have always been break them off, drill them out and replace.....The brochures don't mention this stuff eh?"
1074541,Rizzo,2021-07-03 00:11:00,4754,"oh ya I went through that around 8 years ago. I sold myÂ Princecraft to a member here because I needed something heavier to fish great lakes and lake St Clair. But man I loved the boat and felt kinda bad about it for a bit. LuckilyÂ I know Rob continues to enjoy that boat and occasionally see the odd picture here of it. The good news is, the boat I bought to replace it has also been great! That certainly helped get over the blues of selling it! Hope your new ride also works out great."
1074542,bigcreekdad,2021-07-03 00:29:00,546,Thanks Rizzo
