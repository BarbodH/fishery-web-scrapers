I have been pretty absent posting here for a while 2 kids in 2 years and a  pandemic what can I say.    Was supposed to go to Nipigon this year after skipping last year due to the 'vid and the birth of my seccond child.   Crown land camping was up in the air till last moment this year and so one of the regulars took a contract to frame a few houses with no guarantee we were going to be able to go. So we cancelled .  We all had some vacay planned but the 15 hr drive would cut into fishing......Plan B We endeded up north of North bay and south of New liskard.  Boats loaded heavy enough to not get on plane for the 40k  ride  in, mostly beer and single malt  weight. Lake was down 4 ft of water, unpleasant as the fist 20 k of our trip was normaly through 10-15 fow only kissed once  ,  We got pounded by 40k wind the first few days not able to fish prime spots. Enough with the negatives, what we did have was a few days of stellar  fishing 20 -25 inch walleye and  two years of chirps and laughter saved up, made for a wonderful  release.   Even ran into fellow ofc'er chuckenwind up there was good to catch up, Haddent seen him since we braved the snow one fall like lunatics to chase Auroras dropped In the wrong lake a bunch of years ago... long story.  Even rumors he caught a Walter of a lifetime.  Maybe he can chime in with a pic of the beast.  Hope everyone's doing OK. Hopeing to do a little more fishing this year.    Here's the goods.                 "

Need to get a full report up, we got a lot luckier with the weather but it seems like you did a bit better on the fishing! glad to see you back hopefully you are free enough to do some more posting, been a bit of a ghost town around here lately. Truthfully seems like a lot of the guys are retired from fishing/physical limitations limit how often they can go and poke a few. what you are going to have to do is teAch the kids and bring them when they are old enough. Then they can be the ones chirping you old farts"

1074549,Rizzo,2021-07-03 12:55:00,4754,Great report...man that fish posted by Chuck is a SLOB. Sounds like an awesome time...better to fish in some tough conditions than not fish at all!
