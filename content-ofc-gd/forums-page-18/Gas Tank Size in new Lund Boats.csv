1074283,bigcreekdad,2021-06-25 11:28:00,546,I'm thinking of a new boat (again). One I'm interested in the the Lund 1650 Angler. One deal breaker is the 6.5 portable gas tank. For a near 17' boat with a 50hp engine. What were they thinking?
1074284,AKRISONER,2021-06-25 11:49:00,5558,I’m gonna keep it straight with you. Don’t buy a 16 twin console. buy a tiller from a reputable company. the fishability of them is 10000000x better
1074285,bigcreekdad,2021-06-25 12:13:00,546,"The one I'm looking at is a tiller. Looks like great boat, but I don't like the 6.5 gallon plastic removable gas tank."
1074286,Dara,2021-06-25 12:35:00,3052,Thats plenty of gas in my mind. My 60 will run wide open for 3 hours on that much gas. Easier to keep fresh fuel in it. Pro's and cons but not something I would dwell on
1074287,craigdritchie,2021-06-25 12:45:00,1586,"If you're worried about the fuel capacity, Smoker Craft's Excursion 166T is very similar in layout and comes with an internal 24 gal / 90L fuel tank. I've driven a couple of these, they're nice boats. https://www.smokercraft.com/showroom/2021/fishing/excursion/166-t "
1074288,AKRISONER,2021-06-25 12:46:00,5558,"There’s 0 comparing a smoker craft to a Lund though. you will save some dough, but Lund guys are lund guys and understandably so."
1074289,Sinker,2021-06-25 13:51:00,8692,"Thats plenty of gas for a 50hp 4 stoke engine. I can fish for days and days on a 25L tank with my 40 yamaha. No need to haul around any more than that anyways. If your going so far that you need more, just bring it in gerry cans. S."
1074290,kickingfrog,2021-06-25 14:26:00,8333,For reference I have a 16 foot princecraft side console with a 50hp 4 stroke Johnson (2003). Three days of running and trolling on Nipissing this spring and when I went to add gas to the tank before going out this week I couldn't even add 10 litres to the tank. The motors are so efficient that a tank that size is fine (I would think that today's engines are even better than one that is almost 20 years old). I do have a second tank that I bring sometimes if I'm remote and/or I'm worried about finding no-ethinol gas. For me I like having 2 tanks rather than one big one b/c I don't have to worry about old gas.
1074294,BillM,2021-06-26 02:19:00,17367,What's wrong with a 25L tank in that boat?
1074318,porkpie,2021-06-26 20:20:00,2521,"I have done this first hand with a 16 Lund, external tank, 50hp Honda.  No problem you’ll run all day on that tank."
1074346,kickingfrog,2021-06-27 14:21:00,8333,How are boats nowadays for accurate fuel gauges for built in tanks? My only experience is 70's and 80's boats and those gauges were terrible.
1074347,BillM,2021-06-27 17:19:00,17367,Still terrible lol
1074348,Fisherman,2021-06-27 17:51:00,7201,"Have to agree, a 25L tank in my 16 with an F40 Yamaha, all day, all night, Mary Ann."
1074351,Dara,2021-06-27 21:38:00,3052,Sorry but Devils advocate I have an on board in my 16' Sylvan and fished Lady Eveleyn for a week and never had to put gas in or change a tank . Thats a nice feature . Pros and cons
1074426,porkpie,2021-06-29 22:35:00,2521,"My boat is full until it’s on a quarter tank LOL, and it’s a 2009."
1074463,Sinker,2021-06-30 14:58:00,8692,"Yes, but you also hauled around a lot of extra weight for the first half of your week lol S."
1074476,Dara,2021-06-30 19:16:00,3052,"Thats true in many cases but that time we went to Lady Evelyn, boat in only,  and would have had to haul it anyway. And up here around St Marys river Lake Huron north channel it doesn't hurt to have a bit of gas on board.   Pros-Cons"
1074489,OMCDinosaur,2021-07-01 12:12:00,18,"I'm sure if the small tank is a dealbreaker, the salesman will courteously upgrade to a big boy sized tank. LOL you 4 strokers."
1074555,Gravyboat,2021-07-03 17:48:00,44,"You can put dual tanks in that boat if it worries you.  Or, bump up to the 1650 Rebel XL. 5"" wider beam and internal tank."
1074559,irishfield,2021-07-03 21:33:00,26272,Today's fuel I'd be all over the can vs a built in tank! With my 275 maybe not so much though...
1074610,Rattletrap2,2021-07-05 20:54:00,1652,My last boat was a built in tank and this one is a portable. I would take the portable any day of the week! I have a 16.5 foot Alumacraft with a 40 hp 4 stroke Yamaha. The thing sips gas!
