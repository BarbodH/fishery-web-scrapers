389173,muskymike,2009-10-02 00:19:00,772,"Hey guys,  I own a 2000 Chev Silverado and need a part.  Today while driving on site, I tried to undo my window and nothing happened. I could hear the Motor working, but the glass isn't moving. I am only able to sandwich the glass with my hands and manually pull it up and push it down.  So I took my door apart after work and looked around. At first i thought it was the glass holders (sorry not a car guy and dont know the technical name) as the rubber pad on the one side had been displaced. Fixed that, and before putting the door back together I thankfully tested it. Nothing happened still and the motor was moving.  So I did a little more poking around and realized that the Regulator Cable had snapped and was hanging freely.  I came in called CTC, they couldnt get the part. Called Part Source, $179.99. So I took my search online.  Checked out a few sites, they had the parts, a lot cheaper than Part Source but I always check third party reviews before ordering anything online from a new company. Turns out they all have the same reviews, with the same problems.  So now i am stuck and need your help.  Where can I pick up a 2000 Chev Silverado LT 5.3L Driver Door Regulator for a decent price? Or am I stuck with PS and CTC?  I am in Ottawa but I am in the GTA almost every weekend.  Thanks for your help guys  Mike"
