1074202,mamona,2021-06-22 14:23:00,597,No bug repellent on this list? What about whiskey? 
1074204,gordy28,2021-06-22 16:01:00,638,So I would consider those obvious choices lol.  This list was supposed to be the things you may forget as crucial 
1074222,akaShag,2021-06-22 23:18:00,2073,"PILLOW!!! Buy wine in a box.  Drink wine, save the bag, instant pillow.  Your pillow slip is your spare t-shirt. You want a BIG pillow?  Buy the Magnotta 16 litre bag in box.  At six bucks a litre for wine, what's not to love?  You may want to drink the 16 litres before your fly-in so you can actually USE the bag as a pillow.  But if you are on a week long trip and take a 16 litre box of wine with you, the 2 litres a day will probably make you forget what a pillow is, or why on earth you wanted one.  After all, the floor is VERY comfortable!  😁 Doug"
