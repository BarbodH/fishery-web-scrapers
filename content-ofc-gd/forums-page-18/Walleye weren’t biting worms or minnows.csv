1073829,kickingfrog,2021-06-05 17:57:00,8333,But we lost count of how many were whacking crank baits. Biggest was just under 20 inches. Most were      16-18.     
1073830,misfish,2021-06-05 18:03:00,29133,Growing so fast Rob.
1073831,Rizzo,2021-06-05 21:15:00,4754,nice job! Some beauty looking fish
1073835,kickingfrog,2021-06-06 02:57:00,8333,Like a weed. They were very clean if not monsters.
1073836,kickingfrog,2021-06-06 03:02:00,8333,And after a winter of basically spending most of my “mad money” exclusively on musky baits and building a new lure box to house them I  catch a very solid musky on…      
1073840,Sinker,2021-06-06 15:07:00,8692,"I've caught my biggest walleyes fishing for musky, and my best musky fishing for walleye...lol "
1073851,AKRISONER,2021-06-07 02:52:00,5558,4 out of 5 biggest walleyes were up shallow on clear sunny days throwing chatterbaits and jerkbaits for bass...go figure looks like some very nice table fare there
1073855,Old Ironmaker,2021-06-07 15:16:00,8243,"Ain't that the truth. Caught my 1st Musky, sort of a Tiger, trolling a BLack Fury looking for a Pic, I said ""Man I never saw a big Pike jump!!!"" At least you guys boated a few, we got the Skunkeye yesterday.  Good to see the kid chuafering Pop's around."
1073861,kickingfrog,2021-06-07 22:27:00,8333,Same on Saturday night. With another good walleye chop.  
1073869,Terry,2021-06-08 13:02:00,14456,Nice
1073875,LeXXington,2021-06-08 23:09:00,1928,nice fish there!!
1074019,grimsbylander,2021-06-14 00:02:00,3016,"Very nice! You guys sure figured them out. BTW, GREAT hat. I've looked for a decent hat just like that but can't find one that fits me."
1074042,kickingfrog,2021-06-14 21:16:00,8333, I don't wear them except fishing and hunting. That was a Bass pro purchase.
