1073382,Freshtrax,2021-05-19 13:51:00,2215,Oh boy your in troubble now... nothing compares to the enjoyment I  get from chasing brookies...
1073383,mamona,2021-05-19 14:12:00,597,Well said. Congrats on your first brookie.
1073402,kickingfrog,2021-05-19 18:46:00,8333,"Very nice. They don't all come that big... at least mine don't, but they're all trophies."
1073417,slopster,2021-05-19 21:19:00,7,What a beautiful fish. Well done. Brought back fun memories of fishing for brookies in Nova Scotia many years ago in streams 3-4 feet wide. That was back in the day when you could follow a stream along its bank even if it crossed private property.
1073433,digitalkreation,2021-05-20 00:21:00,25,Love those colors.  Congrats!
1073445,Chuck Enwinde,2021-05-20 04:23:00,247,"Nice going Ron. If there's a finer looking fish that swims our waters, I haven't seen it."
1073449,Duckie,2021-05-20 13:08:00,305,Thanks Brad!  I saw some bigger ones but i wasn't able to get them to hit. next time i will conquer them lol
1073501,BillM,2021-05-21 13:44:00,17367,"I love those fish.  If you're releasing them consider pinching the barbs, makes the release much easier."
1073507,Duckie,2021-05-21 17:34:00,305,good point! pun intended. i am not eating anything i catch.
1073647,Canuck,2021-05-27 01:11:00,491,"Nova Scotia brook trout.  This is a picture after one of my first dates with my bride.  About 35 years ago.  Sometimes you just know that they are the one, when you say lets go catch some trout today.  I think my secret creek near Cow Bay is probably a subdivision drainage ditch by now.

1073703,PGnewflyfisher,2021-05-30 22:26:00,2,"Great -  well done! They are so pretty and colourful.  I'm sure you enjoyed the experience. Caught my first one last year and have been trying to find more locations withing an hours drive from me - not an easy task even with Google maps. Got hooked on fly fishing (barbless hooks always) which adds to the enjoyment and frustration that goes along with it despite my seniors years. Its a long drive to the Grand River, but my next challenge is to catch something larger in the trout species without getting too intimidated."
1073706,Rizzo,2021-05-31 11:57:00,4754,"wow what a beauty! I only ever went after brookies once and the fish I caught were the size of a middle finger, nothing like that one! Truly gorgeous fish though"
1073708,misfish,2021-05-31 13:29:00,29133,"Back when,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I lived in Brampton, late 70,s early 80,s, there were some great places to catch them.  It was nothing to just stop at streams on hwy 10 and I would get them.  Grand Valley was a great spot. I would walk miles and fish that area."
1073709,bushart,2021-05-31 14:00:00,2628,"I agree---one of our greatest species we have I thought so---so much that when we built I had a pond dug and stocked it with them and some bows Was one of the greatest things I ever ""had"" Had as much fun feedin them as catchin them--but alas----predators and fluctuating water levels put me outta the game Great tho while it lasted---this was them     "
