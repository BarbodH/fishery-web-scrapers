1062468,Hack_Fisherman,2020-05-29 02:12:00,720,"Wow, did you leave any behind?"
1062470,Lord Letto,2020-05-29 02:15:00,70,"Left them all there, don't need another rod at the moment, but I took pics & thought I'd post as I found it interesting that they had a brand name rod available there."
1062487,OhioFisherman,2020-05-29 13:47:00,6623,"Most of your big name rod brands make budget models too, although 4 bucks is dirt cheap, I wouldn't expect it to be much besides a fishing rod."
1062489,mamona,2020-05-29 14:03:00,597,This ^. I picked up $10 Daiwa from CT one day (just for a kid). It did not survive one weekend.
1062521,cheaptackle,2020-05-29 19:31:00,849,Check carefully - it only says shimano on the tag not the rod... 
1062523,lew,2020-05-29 19:33:00,12766,When you see a Shimano for $4 just keep on walkin.
1062593,grimsbylander,2020-05-31 01:44:00,3016,"Hey itâ€™s a $4 rod...if I was close to Kitchener Iâ€™d buy 3-4 just to give out to my neighbours kids. Thatâ€™s how kids get into fishing and enjoying the outdoors. Not starting with Stradics!! Letto, pm me the address of the Dollarama as I may be in Cambridge this week. Thereâ€™s 4 young boys on my street that might need a new rod!"
1062598,Lord Letto,2020-05-31 03:49:00,70,"Address of the store for the RodsÂ is in the OP it's rod only, not a combo, so If you need a reel to go with it, I visited the Highland Hills location yesterday (875 Highland Rd W, Kitchener, ON N2N 2Y2) to see if they had any Fraser Farm Meatballs & Gravy that I saw there in the pastÂ (sadly I never saw any)Â & saw they had Zebco 202 Spincast Reels there for $4: "
1062608,Rizzo,2020-05-31 13:27:00,4754,I remember as a kid having a spincast zebco...was allowed to put a weight on it only and I would practice casting in a fieldÂ for hours.
1074240,Pang,2021-06-23 13:21:00,1,"If you see it , get it . This rod originally sold at Walmart as a combo included the reel. A lot of them the reel got stolen so it sell the whole lot to Dollarama. I purchased the combo and it works great."
1074242,AKRISONER,2021-06-23 13:39:00,5558,im once again asking people to start reading dates on posts.  How are they even finding these old threads????
1074244,mamona,2021-06-23 14:33:00,597,They might be coming from Google search results.
1074253,GBW,2021-06-23 23:46:00,8460,BOTS? another maybe
1074254,Whitespinnerbait,2021-06-24 00:02:00,2038,Is there some kind of policy that says you can't bring up old threads ?? ðŸ¤”
1074255,pics,2021-06-24 00:08:00,1268,I know this is an older thread but the Dollarama in Ancaster meadowlands had a good selection of filet knives. They had the 9 and 7 inch Shimano plus a mustad and a Shakespeare 6 inch.. decent enough for a backup knife..
1074256,lew,2021-06-24 00:19:00,12766,Why do you care if someone brings up an old post ?
1074258,AKRISONER,2021-06-24 02:42:00,5558,Because the subject matter is usually totally irrelevant. It could even trick someone into wasting time and going to said store thinking that the op is reflective of today. 
1074259,misfish,2021-06-24 08:56:00,29133,"More fishing,less reading. LOL"
1074270,mamona,2021-06-24 14:09:00,597,"So true  More rain in coming days, I will be more reading I guess."
