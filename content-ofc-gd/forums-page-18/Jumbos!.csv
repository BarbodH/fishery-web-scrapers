Tons of jet skis everywhere, and a bunch of idiots that flew by us when we were sitting and fishing within like 20 feet.   	The first fish bray reeling in was the 13 inch plus jumbo, his new personal best.

1073998,AKRISONER,2021-06-13 12:20:00,5558,"The bass boat industry legitimately sold out of boats in 2020. All brands. it’s basically impossible to buy a motor to repower. guys that bought lowrance forward facing sonar in December are still waiting for delivery. Those are some strong indicators. nice fish by the little man, he’s a lot younger than I am and has my personal best tied."
