1074026,mamona,2021-06-14 14:09:00,597,Lovely report. Why summer fishing sucks? For me it is almost a prime time.
1074028,LostAnotherOne,2021-06-14 14:22:00,956,Just the boat traffic and all.  I like things a little bit quieter where your not getting hit with waves all the time or someone going over your lines when trolling.  That’s why trolling in December is my favourite time lol.
