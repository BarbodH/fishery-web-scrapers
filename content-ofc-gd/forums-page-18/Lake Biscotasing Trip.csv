1074687,floater,2021-07-08 11:49:00,220,We are heading up to D&D Bisco Cottages in September to fish Lake Biscotasing. Never been there. We are shooting for Pike and Pickerel. Looks like a big complicated Lake. I'm sure we won't even fish 1 percent of it.!! Has anyone fished this lake? Thanks

1074700,Big Cliff,2021-07-08 17:37:00,6899,Fished it once many years ago and had a wonderful time. I can't help you much with advice other than watch out for rocks just below the surface ðŸ˜². Our best baits were jigs durring the day and crank baits in the evenings.

1074705,floater,2021-07-08 19:54:00,220,Water is down that much?? I have a spare prop. Jigging with worms is my go to for pickerel. I sure hope we get into some monster pike as well.

How bad are those roads in? We are going west on Sultan Industrial then south on Ramsey road to Bisco Road. Should i come prepared with a welder and some steel stock to fix my old trucks suspension??
