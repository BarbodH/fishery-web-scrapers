I’m relatively new to the musky game, and scoffed at people when they told me it’s addictive, I have to admit I have an addiction…. 😂. Been raising fish, follows, and heartbreaking losses before getting the net under them, too many to even put a number to, but did put some in the boat.   "

1074737,LefroyFisherman,2021-07-09 21:42:00,602,Awesome fish! nice work! How big is the one in the third picture?
1074739,Rizzo,2021-07-09 22:50:00,4754,"beauties! especially the 3rd one. After fishing almost exclusively for muskies the past 20 years I gotta admit, a bit of a salmon obsession is creeping in on me now as well"
1074748,limeyangler,2021-07-10 04:18:00,5204,"I never got a tape on it, it was such a shambles netting and unhooking all by myself in almost complete darkness I thought it best to get it in the water again ASAP, it swam away happily. My initial thoughts were over 50”, and looking at the picture my guess is well over 50”. It’s head across the top from gill plate to gill  plate must have been 9”, a really scary beast! I’m 6’2” and if I held it up it would come up to my chest at least, I think it was just under 60” but I guess I’ll never know or be able to prove it, but I’m counting myself in the over 50” no matter what anyone says."
1074749,lew,2021-07-10 09:26:00,12766,Some nice fish there Simon and just for a comparison to help you guesstimate the size of that last one here's a fish that was accurately measured at 54.5 inches.    
1074751,LefroyFisherman,2021-07-10 12:08:00,602,Wow! Monster! I gotta start fishing way up there sometime
1074753,Rizzo,2021-07-10 13:19:00,4754,"good for you! My second musky ever was a true beast (of course all of em look like a beast when you are new to muskies!) but I also figured I was a part of the 50"" club...I did not measure it either. When they are that big, you just know. My buddies did razz me about it, so when I did catch another over 50 I made sure to measure it and make it official. Congrats on an awesome fish"
1074766,glen,2021-07-10 19:44:00,2641,Congrats on some big fish. That one (from looking at a picture) is over 55”. 	 A true giant for sure.

1074774,glen,2021-07-10 22:27:00,2641,If I leave now how long will it take me to get there? 😂
