1074035,BillM,2021-06-14 17:50:00,17367,Shouldn't be hard to catch bass on Rice.  No need for other people's waypoints.
1074036,misfish,2021-06-14 17:53:00,29133,Jig and pig dunking (if anyone does it anymore lol ) weed pockets and flip the docks. Senkos work great weightless.
1074080,moxie,2021-06-16 16:14:00,1566,They can be found just about anywhere on the lake. Take a look at a map and maybe concentrate on weed flats and edges.
