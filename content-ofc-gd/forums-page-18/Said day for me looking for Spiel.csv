1074320,skinny,2021-06-26 21:02:00,442,Some time ago I was lucky enough to be the recipient of one of your custom rods . It was built for the fish a thon for a cure Â .  I used this rod as I was told it was not to be a shelf queen  well today the top section broke in two  was it fishing Waterford ponds when it got snagged in weeds Â I stopped and didnâ€™t do anything as the other person in boat had fish on as soon as we were done landing I picked up the road Â and did a slow steady. Snap that was it and it broke  it was really an odd thing as it didnâ€™t feel that stuck and after the break everything just cranked into the boat  looking for Spiel the builder of the rod with hopes of new top section
1074325,aplumma,2021-06-26 22:16:00,6896,I sent him a message and he should get back to you the next time he comes here. I do know that he has quite a few orders to fill on custom rods. Art 
1074352,Dara,2021-06-27 21:55:00,3052,I had alwaysÂ heard..herd? that snapping at a snag can break a rod. 40 yearsÂ  fishing and I snapped a brand new St Croix. Hope he can do it.
