1074527,skinny,2021-07-02 14:27:00,442,Ok so years ago I fished dunnville a bit  (Bass) but I remember seeing people trolling I no longer have a large boat to hit lake but I have my gear and a 14’ boat thinking of rigging it up or is lead fine maybe only deer divers are needed  any help or suggestions
1074538,porkpie,2021-07-02 21:42:00,2521,Bottom bouncer selection between 1 and 2 ounces and some worm harnesses should get you down and get you fishing at dunnville if it’s pickerel your after.
1074540,skinny,2021-07-02 22:59:00,442,I do have all my down rigging equipment riggers lead core long line rods  is that stuff usable or go get btm bounce stuff 
1074545,Freshtrax,2021-07-03 03:33:00,2215,Lots of walleye in the lake off the grand  in 2nd half of the summer.  Pick your days it can get nasty.
1074547,porkpie,2021-07-03 05:38:00,2521,"If you want to fish just the river, just stick with the bottom bouncers.  You can put them off planer boards if that floats your boat!"
1074598,Wallyman,2021-07-05 14:31:00,31,Trolling the river try using shallow crankbaits or firetiger rapalas.  Being as muddy as it is you need to make noise and stir up mud.   Might just hit a snag or two though. Good luck.
1074599,skinny,2021-07-05 15:00:00,442,are people using reg rods or more back bone and rigging type rods 
1074603,Wallyman,2021-07-05 15:49:00,31,Regular 7 ft trolling with 10 mono and a 4 ft fluorocarbon leader is what I used there.  I used mono so f I hit a snag the hook wouldn't bury itself right away. There is a lot of wood in there. Good luck.
1074618,Musky Plug,2021-07-06 00:47:00,398,I went a few times last season. Worm harnesses and smaller stick baits worked. The public launch was a disaster though.
