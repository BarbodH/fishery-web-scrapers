I ordered one from a local marina over the winter and they are just dragging their feet installing it on my boat - I made an app't in early April to bring it in June they my boat for almost 2 weeks (promising it will be done in a couple of days) so I decided to just grab my boat and they can keep the platform (I have not paid for it anyway).  I had enough of their Bull. So I am looking at other options - what is everyone using?

My buddy gave me the idea (and the material) to build a back deck for the kids to get across the splash well when tubing.  I really like this set up.  Easy in and out of the boat.  Don’t mind the uneven screw holes in the back “deck”.  I fabbed it standing at the rear of the boat and didn’t line it up perfectly.  I just move the spare kicker gas can for swimming or tubing.  Having the platform has been really nice.  They aren’t hard to install.  You should have a go at  it, just take your time!The "
1074030,fundseeker,2021-06-14 14:50:00,27,I installed a boarding platform with telescoping steps that I bought off Kijiji on my 16 ft Misty River. Great for swimming and legal for emergency re-entry into the boat if you fall out. Otherwise you would need to carry a portable gunnel mount  ladder which really don't work very well on many boats . And if you fall overboard while alone there's no one on board to place the ladder for you.
