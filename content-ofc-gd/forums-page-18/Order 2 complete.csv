Fire tiger version  Fire works      Also wanted some crappie jigs, so came up with these for him. Kept a few for myself of course.  What is cool with this guys ( sons buddies ) they know I am no pro tier, but they do know that these fly's are time and cost of material . They are happy to pay a fair price for what I do . They also work, which is the gratifying part for me.  "
