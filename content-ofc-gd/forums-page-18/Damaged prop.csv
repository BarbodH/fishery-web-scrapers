1073389,LostAnotherOne,2021-05-19 15:44:00,956,"Well the title says it all.  Bought it new last year and I was hoping to get a few years out of it before making any repairs, but sometimes I underestimate my judgement lol.  I filed all the blades down so they are kinda sorta smooth now.  Anyways I’ve never changed a prop before (it’s a 2020 Yamaha) and was wondering if there’s anything I should know before taking it apart and installing a new one.  I watched a few vids so it doesn’t look too difficult.

1073391,porkpie,2021-05-19 16:03:00,2521,"Remove cotterpin, spin off the prop nut.  Check to see if there is any crap or fishing line wrapped around the shaft, then hit it with a very light coat of marine grease and re-install.  FYI there is an outfit called Citywide welding down in toronto that can fix that up good as new.  I had one done there years ago and it turned out great."
1073398,OhioFisherman,2021-05-19 17:15:00,6623,"I would get that repaired or replaced before using it, it's going to be out of balance and that might affect the motor. Like porkpie says, there should be a shop in your area to repair it, and it's always nice to carry a spare."
1073401,DRIFTER_016,2021-05-19 18:42:00,10439,"Pull prop, take to Citywide Propeller Repair on Drew Road in Mississauga for repair, reinstall prop, go boating. You could also put a new prop on, get this one repaired and have a spare. I have 4 props for my boat.  Address: 1867 Drew Rd, Mississauga, ON L5S 1J5 Phone: (905) 612-8040"
1073423,Hack_Fisherman,2021-05-19 22:30:00,720,"+ 1 on the spares. Even if you don’t fix it, it will get you home if you trash the main."

1073439,Musky Plug,2021-05-20 01:17:00,398,X2. Highly recommend this place took my rig there when I broke off my skeg last season. Straightened and repaired for $150/$175 can’t recall for sure. Had it done in one day. They even repainted my prop and lower unit for no charge. Great customer service.
1073440,Rizzo,2021-05-20 01:28:00,4754,ya easy to get off. For me the hardest part is getting the dang cotter pin out in the tight quarters. After that just turn the nut counter clockwise and should be able to slider her off. Definitely don't use that prop as it is motor will vibrate like crazy and you may damage something else!
1073455,LostAnotherOne,2021-05-20 15:44:00,956,Thanks for the feedback boys.  Ordered it last night ($100).  Should be delivered by June 10 so will let you know how things went.  Means no fishing for a few weeks (twitch twitch) for me.
1073791,LostAnotherOne,2021-06-03 15:27:00,956,Got it delivered yesterday and installed with zero issues.  Best to use an adjustable wrench as opposed to channel locks to loosen the bolt lol.  Pin was a little tricky to get back in.  Just going to throw the old prop in the boat hoping to never use it again.  Thanks for the feedback thou.
1073797,woodenboater,2021-06-03 21:15:00,2277,"I'd save the agro and get a prop wrench if it were me. and yeah, spares. and def don't run a prop that's met Canadian Shield. it will likely shake like hell and possibly damage the motor."
1073801,Dara,2021-06-03 22:59:00,3052,I'm late to the dance but your owners manual has prop changing instructions/procedures including torque values for the nut.

1074370,Rattletrap2,2021-06-28 18:07:00,1652,Always a good idea to pick up a few new cotter pins and replace them each time you pull one out.
1074381,glen,2021-06-28 22:46:00,2641,You don’t need a cotter pin just never put it in reverse.   	how do I know?  Don’t ask and not my boat.  Lol.
1074497,OMCDinosaur,2021-07-01 13:05:00,18,"Remembering the shear pin days,.... never bent a shaft or busted a gearcase on a silly rock, back then. prop repairs were cost efficient too.  *sniff*"
