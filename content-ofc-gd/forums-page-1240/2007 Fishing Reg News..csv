55741,TJQ,2007-04-05 18:11:00,7806,"---------------------------------------------------------------- O.F.A.H. supports Province on delay of new fishing regulations ----------------------------------------------------------------  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (O.F.A.H.) congratulates the Minister of Natural Resources for listening to the angling community across Ontario and delaying the implementation of the new fishing regulations until January 1, 2008.  ""The O.F.A.H. is pleased that Minister Ramsay listened to the O.F.A.H. and other stakeholders who strongly suggested that if the new regulations were not ready in time for the open water season, implementing them in mid-season would have caused chaos,"" said Mike Reader, O.F.A.H. Executive Director.  ""The development of the new regulations has been a long and complicated process. We are pleased that after almost two years of consultation, that the Ministry listened to the angling community and made significant changes to the proposed regulations. While this may have delayed the introduction of the new package, it was more important to listen to the concerns of the people who will be affected by the changes. Rushing the implementation would have prevented this and the government should be congratulated on doing the right thing.""  As noted in the Ministry's media release, anglers should continue to use the 2005-2006 rules until the new regulatory package takes effect, with the exception of a few changes to bass and walleye seasons that took effect on January 1, 2007. These changes can be viewed at www.mnr.gov.on.ca or www.ofah.org."
