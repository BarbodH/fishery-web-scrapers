55520,taper,2007-04-05 04:01:00,611,I just bought my first one this winter and can't wait to try it out.
55642,woodro,2007-04-05 15:19:00,168,"ya i bought the pointer 100 in the winter as well, i had a chance to use it once fishing for pike in the harbour. It casts amazing, retrieves consistent, and darts erractically. You can deffinately tell its no $7 jerk bait, wouldnt be able to tell you if its worth the money because i actually lost mine before i had a chance to catch anything"
55688,Blake,2007-04-05 16:34:00,418,"If you have confidence in them you will catch fish.  I have used them and sold most of them to stay with other brands that are less money that have performed well like Rapala, Excaliber, Yozuri, Action Lures, Bagley's etc"
55715,Hooked,2007-04-05 17:08:00,891,"I'm biting the bullet and going to buy the Pointer 100DD.  Heard the action is something fierce, looking forward to getting it first, and then trying it at the opener for Quinte eyes."
55722,fishsmasher,2007-04-05 17:22:00,26,"also guys there is a bait call the jackal squirrel dd its comparable to the lucky craft DD ,awesome bait ,set the hook has them ,there about the same price as a lucky ,but i love my Lucky's as well."
55734,misfish,2007-04-05 17:42:00,29133,"I have heard nothing but great things about them but I have yet to buy one. I have been using the megabass baits and doing well on them.  They are pretty much in the same price zone.  Like Blake said,what ever catch,s the fish.  Those Yozuri,s are nothing to sneeze at either."
55881,bpcbear2000,2007-04-06 00:51:00,25,"I have used the lucky craft  pointers out in lake Powell in Az. for Stripers for years so I tried it last year in Ontario on Crotch lake an the walleye liked the jointed pointer on a jerk retrive. I saw a few just off the boat come up behind it on the pause and watch it till I would jerk it then they would slam it, They were all slot fish. The lucky Craft are high priced but they cast and hold up and never need tuning."
