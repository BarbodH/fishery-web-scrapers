55766,GbayGiant,2007-04-05 19:23:00,1780,"What are you using these for ? pike.  How are the Penn reels ? I know they make a couple suitable for Pike an  Musky, but never tried one."
55825,SlowPoke,2007-04-05 21:28:00,2984,"The Penn 209's are for downrigging salmon on Lake O with a Daiwa Heartland 9'6"" H. They will also make due for Muskie/Pike trolling rods. The Penn 309 Leadcore will be used on Lake O and Lake E on an Abu Garcia ""Fishstik"" 8'6"" M. Ready for bows, eyes and salmon but will likely find sheephead and silver bass.  The trolling arsenal as it stands now... (2) Penn 209 / Daiwa Heartland Heavy 9'6"" (Salmon downrigging / Muskie inlines and planer boards) (1) Penn 309 / Abu Garcia Fishstik Medium 8'6"" (Leadcore) (2) Shimano TR200G / Shimano Triton Medium 8' (Salmon, bows, eyes downrigging and planer boards) (1) Shimano Triton 300 / Fenwick Riggerstik Medium 9' (Salmon, bows, eyes downrigging and planer boards) (1) Daiwa Great Lakes 47LC / Okuma Blue Diamond Roller Med-Heavy 8'6"" (Wire line dipsy)  Yet to buy... (2) Linecounters for dipsy and muskie trolling. I'm thinking Convectors or SG47's but may splurge for Tekota's. If I go the cheaper route I'll put them on Daiwa Heartland dipsy rods. If I splurge for the Tekota's I will probably spend extra money on rods too... Talora's maybe. I'm worth it  Oh, almost forgot, need a rod rack!  -Brian"
55831,irishfield,2007-04-05 21:55:00,26272,"I bought 2 - Penn209's for downrigging and have them on 8' 6 TDR's. One of the 209's puked a gear on it's third use last year, but of course more than a year after I bought it. Sent it to Rocky's Tackle and had it repaired for less than $25 (mind you they're only an $85 reel). Hopefully they put up with some usage this time around."
55835,lew,2007-04-05 22:23:00,12767," Go for the Tekota 600LC for your musky poles Brian, absolutely the best trolling reel I've ever owned !!"
55856,SlowPoke,2007-04-05 23:24:00,2984," I'm already sold on that reel Lew but they're a big chunk of change! I still want to upgrade my riggers, add 6 Down Easters, Bert's Tracks, Bert's Mast, upgrade the fishfinder, replace my floor, add a built-in fuel tank, upgrade to a 4 stroke kicker... I wish I could afford to do it all at once but some things may have to wait.  The boat was the cheap part!  -Brian"
