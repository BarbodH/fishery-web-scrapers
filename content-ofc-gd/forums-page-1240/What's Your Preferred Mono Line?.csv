56093,fishindevil,2007-04-06 15:33:00,6254,"Most lines that have a co-polymar base are pretty good like trilene and p-line,but as stated its sometimes hard to find and a little more expensive...cheers"
55635,Golfisher,2007-04-05 15:04:00,586,"We've had long threads on braided line and fluoro, and so we might as well complete the circle by talking about mono.  Before I went PP, Trilene Sensation used to be my choice of mono line.  Not sure why though; it was the first line I used, and I pretty much stuck to it as a matter of path dependence.  So, what's your favourite mono line?"
55647,fishindevil,2007-04-05 15:25:00,6254,"Well i pretty much only use line with co-polymer,thats if im bottom bouncing becuase it will stand up to more abraison on all the rocks and zebra muscles but for spinning i like trilene or spiderwire mono...the good stuff not the canadian tire spiderwire for 10 bucks a spool....i use several different lines depending what species im fishing for and i use flouro as well p-line works too....cheers"
55651,tonyb,2007-04-05 15:28:00,1637,"Maxima Ultragreen is good for my float reel, although I am going to try the Chameleon this year.  Trilene XL for light spinning reel line P-Line is also a good choice.  Some of the new hybrid lines look interesting, but are a couple of bucks more than the regular mono.  Not sure if they are worth it yet...  Tony"
55653,bigbuck,2007-04-05 15:30:00,2449,Trilene XL for my spinning reels and Trilene XT for my bass baitcaster (the other gets 50lb PP and the muskie reels get 65lb & 80lb braid)
55699,mdej,2007-04-05 16:50:00,98,"Trilene XL, but got a 4# spool of the MAXX that I'm loading on the ultra light.  My guess is it will be great.  Trilene mono is an old standby that you know you can trust.  I agree that some of the P-Line high bread mono's look interesting."
55700,wolfville,2007-04-05 16:54:00,396,"Berkley Big Game 10lb - 15lb depending on the targeted water and fishing method. Bought some Maxima Ultragreen (75%off, can't pass that deal) and will give that a try this year on some of the reels too."
55728,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-05 17:29:00,2050,"Trilene XL smooth casting!  I've also used 6lb Stren on my ultralight and I have to say I was impressed!  Saved a few lures that got snagged in the trees across the creek!  Cheers, UF"
55739,spanky,2007-04-05 18:07:00,195,"Suffix Elite and Suffix Siege... awesome strength, abrasion resistance and almost no memory... just to bad i have to go to BPS or Gander Mtn to get it..."
55740,misfish,2007-04-05 18:11:00,29133,"Ande or Maxima,both in green, if I use mono."
55764,OhioFisherman,2007-04-05 19:18:00,6623,Stren original florescent blue.
55768,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-05 19:27:00,4399,My 2 favorites are Stren for the spinning reels and Trilene for the baitcasters.  I actually bought a spool of BPS brand mono on sale last year on sale just see if it was any good and I have to say it`s very good for the money.
55769,brkygetr,2007-04-05 19:32:00,425,'Ande' green...hands down although its sometimes hard to find..
55772,FinS,2007-04-05 19:35:00,463,stren and trilene
55773,fishersquige,2007-04-05 19:39:00,52,P-Line Premium its a copolymer and Sensation.
55774,bassfanatic25,2007-04-05 19:39:00,36,Maxima Ultragreen has worked well for me.  Good knot strength and very manageable.
55782,xrap,2007-04-05 19:55:00,683,6lb gamma. I landed 7 salmon over 20lbs and one over 30. This line is tough and not too expensive.
55790,urbanangler1990,2007-04-05 20:07:00,933,"trilene sensation is nice, trilene gets my vote"
55791,JEREMY,2007-04-05 20:08:00,300,I use berkely xl.But i picked up a spool of suffix elite for my my baitcaster and will see how that goes.I am glad phat bassturd mentioned something about it becuase i was wondering how good it was thanx.
55792,Canuck2fan,2007-04-05 20:09:00,1444,"I have been using Raven flourescent green 6lb mono for my main line on my steelheading reels. I like how tough it is, the 40% savings over trilene XT and how easy it is to see versus the low vis green 4lb trilene XT I use for leaders."
55814,MJL,2007-04-05 21:08:00,2427,Excalibur Silverthread (Copolymer) and P-line Floroclear (Hybrid) on the spinning reels.  Other than those I have Raven mono loaded on my centrepins.

55857,FishHeadRic,2007-04-05 23:25:00,226,P-line Co-poly has been my line of choice for the past few years but I also like the Yo-Zuri Co-poly. It's just hard to find up here in Canada.    FHR
55864,PatrickGG,2007-04-05 23:49:00,562,"Hey Ric hows it going? good i hope, you mentioned Yo-Zuri Hybrid""12 pound test"" i have been searching for it myself and ive been unlucky if you know of any place in toronto that has it let me know i would greatly appreciate it."
55875,bpcbear2000,2007-04-06 00:37:00,25,"Trilene XL smooth casting works great for me in 6-8 lb. would not mind trying Yo-Zuri Hybrid, read up a little on it."
