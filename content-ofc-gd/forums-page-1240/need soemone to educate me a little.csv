56123,Heybud_e,2007-04-06 16:35:00,208,does anyone know if the queenston boat launch is still accessible????
56129,Alumacraft,2007-04-06 16:51:00,139,"Yes Queenston is accessible, but you'll  have a 7 mile run out too the lake. You would be better off launching right on the lake. Either Jordan harbour,Port D (St.Catharines Game and Fish) or Port Weller Marina(east side of the canal.Good luck Rob"
56130,Heybud_e,2007-04-06 16:54:00,208,"awesome, but i just want to shore fish  used to be a good location for many species of fish... i havnt fished there in many years, but would like to go n see ya know.... thanks Rob,"
56138,Alumacraft,2007-04-06 17:02:00,139,"Sorry Bud I just assumed that you were looking for trolling info because it's that time of the year.You won't find any salmon in the river at this time of the year, their all out in the lake. Come late August depending on water temps the salmon would start showing up in the river. Rob"
