55858,fishinfool,2007-04-05 23:29:00,366,A friend of mine was asking me if I know what is involved with getting a Harbour Licence so that we can fish around the Toronto Harbour area. Does anyone here know how to go about getting the info or maybe someone has gone through it and can offer some tips/advice. I have heard that there are some real nice sized gators (Pike) in that area and we would like to give it a try when they open back up in Apr. Any info would be greatly appreciated.  SS
