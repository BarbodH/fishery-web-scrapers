55983,andrey7474,2007-04-06 08:12:00,47,"i use Seaguar Grand Max. i order it from states because looks like Canadian stores do not carry it.  advice: guys, do not use Vanish - it stands not even close to seguar. i've tried it once and it just sucks."
55992,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-06 10:27:00,621,"I read a comparative some time back on fluro Seems the Maxima fluro had the best all around abrasion resistance and strength  I am gonna try some this year,for muskies I have always used Seaguar"
56069,Mark Kulik,2007-04-06 14:54:00,348,"I have used Gamma exclusively last season, and have nothing but good things to say about it, you generally get what you pay for."
55055,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-04 02:33:00,108,I use Toray Gaia X Phantom Blue Size #1.2 (18lb). Made in Japan.
55062,xrap,2007-04-04 02:40:00,683,Just got some seaguar fluro fishing line 8lbs at bass proshops. Very satisfied so far.
55065,PatrickGG,2007-04-04 02:48:00,562,I use Seaguar and Maxima.
55080,huntervasili,2007-04-04 03:52:00,1604,"Seaguar, its the main tippet I use when fly fishing..."
55120,OhioFisherman,2007-04-04 09:41:00,6623,"I don`t use it often, but berkley vanish, no problems with it."
55126,canadian_copper,2007-04-04 10:10:00,925,I USE SEAGUAR AS WELL!!! BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING A NEW LINE CALLED VICIOUS AND ITS WORKING VERY WELL!!
55131,jeffw,2007-04-04 10:20:00,267,"I use seaguar in 4,6 for freshwater and 20 for light saltwater. Cheers Jeff"
55144,Blake,2007-04-04 11:15:00,418,Vanish
55148,dheitzner,2007-04-04 11:36:00,314,"i use seagar or raven on the tribs, approx.3-5lb, seagar 8lb as a leader for eyes and smallies in the summer, and 65lbseagar as material for pike/muskie leaders."
55224,mdej,2007-04-04 14:39:00,98,"Tired the Seaguar main line last year on a spinning rig, didn't like it but I don't think it was the manufacturer, I think it was the floro in general.  Now only use floro leaders, Seaguar leader line & Maxima leader line.... Both seem to perform equally well.  I seem to migrate to the Seaguar cause its like 1$ - 2$ cheaper per 27yard spool."

55263,setomonkey,2007-04-04 16:06:00,872,"I use Seaguar for my fluoro leaders.  I wouldn't recommend spooling fluoro as your main line, I did that once and found the line was stiff and had a lot of memory coming off the spinning reel.  Mike "
55264,Bigfish,2007-04-04 16:12:00,19,"Segar, very smooth, and easy to cast. Expensive but I feel its worth it."
55265,mattyk,2007-04-04 16:13:00,2110,I also use seaguar fluro but im not happy with it. ITs a little stiff. I think i my try the pline floro coated mono. I have heard good things about it.
55349,xrap,2007-04-04 19:58:00,683,What do you guys mean by stiff? The line works well for me and I haven't expierenced any tangles yet. Even when I leave the spool open the line doesn't jump off. Although when I cast I do find it tough to toss because the line is so thin it sometimes just jumps out of my hand.
55351,lew,2007-04-04 20:02:00,12767,"I use 130 pound Seaguar leaders on my musky rods.  About 18 - 24"" for casting rods and 48"" on the trolling rods  Great stuff !!"
55391,JFR,2007-04-04 21:45:00,498,"It is not necessary to spool your entire reel with fluorocarbon line. Only need fluoro as a leader.  I currently use 130# Seaguar for musky leaders.  When I'm fly fishing or using other types of fishing gear, I use a quality mono, like Ande, Maxima, and a fluoro leader.  Depending on the conditions a leader of 18-24"" is sufficient for most fishing applications.  # test of 6 to 12 is more than adequate.  John"
55397,MJL,2007-04-04 21:56:00,2427,For the last 5-6 years I've been using Siglon and Raven Fluorocarbons in 4-10lb for fly/float fishing.  Great stuff. Used to use Seaguar a while back but the shops near my house stopped carrying it.  Still using Titanium for pike fishing...Maybe one day I'll get out of the stone age and try FC in 80+lb for pike leaders.
55418,silveradosheriff,2007-04-04 23:14:00,1025,Seaguar for me.
55462,bpcbear2000,2007-04-05 01:10:00,25,seaguar fluro for a 6ft leader. I don't like the way fluro cast when its spooled on the whole reel
55498,moemoe,2007-04-05 02:21:00,352,"I use the p line 100% fluoro on my main line, along with a spool of power pro for the same reel....been using the p line for three years now and love it...little stiff but hey its fluoro"
55504,kemper,2007-04-05 02:29:00,2232,"Ive been switching through them, started with vanish and the first few batches were awesome, then it went to hell in a handbasket. Tried lots of them but now I just tied up 20 leaders of 4 and 6 pound vanish so called ""improved"".  Well see how it works when the tribs calm down."
55515,xrap,2007-04-05 03:21:00,683,What do you guys mean when you say the line is stiff?
55519,steverowbotham,2007-04-05 03:56:00,1800,seaguar
55605,mdej,2007-04-05 14:26:00,98, When I say still I think more of line memory.  Meaning the loops don't straighten as well coming off the spool.
