55570,Mike the Pike,2007-04-05 12:42:00,3421,Mother nature dumped on us again  and I actually pulled out the snowblower this morning man the snow was very heavy.  Aplumma don't say sorry for cutting the grass its nice to hear someone has nice weather.We will feel sorry for ya during hurricane season.  This is what we got        Just like Lew I took my wife's snow tires off the van she was not pleased with me this morning.  I am driving up to Northbay this evening so hopefully all is clear going up.  Ok winter go away.

Oh well lets make the best of it.Winter yes I am Canadian
56042,pameladallaire,2007-04-06 14:08:00,470,We had to snow blow yesterday when our labrador retriever had trouble walking through the deep snow. I had to shovel to get out this morning and we are still under a storm watch.  Pam
56087,lew,2007-04-06 15:21:00,12767," Good to hear you arrived safely Mike, even without the winter tires.  It's always a tough call as to when is the right time to remove them, but here in Southern Ontaio, were ""usually"" pretty safe by April 1st.......but sometimes we get caught"
56095,bucktail,2007-04-06 15:37:00,1857,"A couple more inches to greet me this morning in Burlington. Thios weekend last year I was off the niagara catching chinook's, lakers and coho's. Still 2-3 weeks away with this forecast."

56153,Rich Clemens,2007-04-06 17:31:00,3131,"Man that sucks.   Cold, windy, and flurries here today.   Heck, just last week we were sitting in the back yard with short sleves in a very warm sun.   Come back Spring ... come back !"
56163,Moosebunk,2007-04-06 18:06:00,3970,"3rd day into the storm up here.  Should be done monday morning.  35-40cm so far.  Had the skidoo away for the summer but couldn't help but get it out again, just to get to work.  Keep pounding down, please snow Gods, keep it coming.  Make my spring river levels just swell and swell and swell.  No boundaries, no prop damage, full out all the way.  Please snow gods from Kapuskasing east to Quebec and south to Timmins.  POUND US!!!!"
56171,Whopper,2007-04-06 18:12:00,2174, Sorry MB I neglected to think about the needs of the north with the water levels. I'll suck it up for another week and that's it!  Whopper
