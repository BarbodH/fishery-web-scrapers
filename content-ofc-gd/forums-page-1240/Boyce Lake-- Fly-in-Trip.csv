52992,penguin,2007-03-29 03:49:00,6,Hi plan on going to Boyce Lake for 4 days of fishing with the guys begining of Aug. It's in the Temagami disrict.I was wondering if anyone has fished that lake and to what sucess? Going with Placid Bay Lodge and any info would be great. Airline is Lakeside Air Lines. THANKS
53055,irishfield,2007-03-29 13:23:00,26272,I imagine you mean Lakeland Airways and that Darren is flying you in in the Beaver from their town dock in Temagami?  Can anyone here help him out??? I sent him over here from the Temagami ottertooth forum.  Wayne
53204,Smokey,2007-03-29 20:22:00,1278,I'm thinking it a new fly-in lake as I flew out of the area for a few years and I didn't hear about it till recently. I'm going to look at my maps of the area and see if I can find anything out for you.
53210,Smokey,2007-03-29 20:38:00,1278,"I had a look at the old Temagami Area Fishing map I have and here is the info on the lake from the guide. It has Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, Northern Pike and Whitefish in it. It also says there is a depth contour map available for the lake, I'm assuming you would have to contact the local MNR office to find out more about that and if they area still around.  It looks like a great lake with lots of islands and bays to fish.  Hope this info helps out and bit and maybe someone has fished it will chime in with some more info for you.  Mike"
