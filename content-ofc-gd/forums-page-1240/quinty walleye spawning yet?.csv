55936,carll2,2007-04-06 02:54:00,443,"i was just wondering if the eyes are spawning yet, my uncle used to live right on the trent river in trenton and when i would go over for easter id get to see all these huge walleyes spawning. i was just wondering if they are in the rivers yet..would be nice to see some pics lol  pulled this pic fom another board i just dont know if its from this year. enjoy  "
55957,GbayGiant,2007-04-06 03:41:00,1780,"I'll have a pic up in a couple weeks, they spawn beside my house, the last 3 years has been, Apr 16th, Apr 9th and April 13th last year so it will be close, it's all about water temp as soon as it hits that magic number it's like clock work.  That pic could be from this year just depends if the water is warm enough, usually within days of ice out is the ideal temp but they've been known to spawn under the ice from what I've read. With this cold weather it could be a week late this year, but it's going to warm up next week.  Can't wait."

56094,bucktail,2007-04-06 15:34:00,1857,"Biggest eye I ever saw was in the Moira on an inside corner as it turns east going thru town. I have caught maybe 200 eyes over 10 pounds out of quinte and this thing would have dwarved them.It was sitting in a pod of 8-9 pounders and was more then twice there size. I honestly think it beat the 20 lb mark. Have never see one close to that size since. I think the spawn will be at least a week late this year, probably 2 weeks late as there is no significant warm up in sight yet. That all said there should be lots of males still hanging around the river mouths for opening day."
56096,fishindevil,2007-04-06 15:37:00,6254,THANKS CARL2 THATS AN AWSOME PIC.  ..OF ALL THOSE WALLEYES SPAWNING WHAT A GREAT SIGHT TO SEE....CHEERS
