55771,ccmtcanada,2007-04-05 19:34:00,7971,"Great work Scott!  I knew if anyone could pull em out of high dirty water it would be you.  Nice lookin hen in that first pic!  Bly and I are gonna try our luck tomorrow...I know...may be packed out there, but I'm hoping the cold weather will keep many at home....LOL.  BTW...your ""tough day"" would be a successful day in my books...LOL"
55780,xrap,2007-04-05 19:52:00,683,"Nice fish, I'll be heading out later today, hope the water is not high around here."
55786,tonyb,2007-04-05 20:03:00,1637,"Gotta love the WILD chrome!  As they say, somebody, somewhere is onto the fish regardless of conditions.  It just happens to be you far to frequently Senor Copper  Tony"
55787,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-05 20:04:00,181,"Those are some nice fish, especially under those conditions!"
55799,Fishstick,2007-04-05 20:24:00,8,Not bad considering. Still glad you talked me out of driving down for the day. Looks like tommorrow will be my first day down there this season!  Maybe I'll see some of you guys out there!  -Eric
55806,Joey,2007-04-05 20:55:00,9122,Very very nice Scott.  What a trooper.  But it paid off.  Good going.  Joey
55810,Photoz,2007-04-05 21:01:00,792,"I found a spot kinda sheltered from that west wind . . . .   but as it got worse, it switched to the northwest . . . .     and brought 2 snowstorms, I hung in till about 10:00, but when the wind was almost blowin' my float outta the water, I packed 'er in. I had one hit . . .  around 06:30 . . . .    was holdin' my rod between my knees while I blew my nose, and my float disappeared . . . .     by the time I jammed my hanky back in my pocket, it had given 2 quick yanks, I yanked back, and ended up with my hook & float tangled up in the fence behind me!! I checked a couple other spots on my way back . ..   too muddy . . .   too fast! Ah h h h h   .   .    .      tomorrow's another day! At least SOMEBODY got SOMETHING. Port Hope had about a half dozen anglers, TOTAL! (With NO fish!)"

55861,finfan,2007-04-05 23:41:00,44,Nice fish dude! Your a real die hard toughing it out. Great result!
55949,xrap,2007-04-06 03:25:00,683,I got out today only for 30 mintues because we got thier late and we couldn't even see our floats in the water. Only one person down there said he caught one small one and lost a nice one. Lots of fish tho. You could see them swimming beside the banks and must of saw half a dozen fish jump. Water was low with a slight green tinge. Maybe try tommrow for a little bit longer.
55965,luv2drift,2007-04-06 04:09:00,147,you catch a lot of steel   man....!  IF your bad day equalled my good day I would be a happy angler!
55974,Forester,2007-04-06 05:09:00,46,Nice!Worth the effort!
