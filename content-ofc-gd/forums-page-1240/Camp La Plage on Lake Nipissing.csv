55458,bpcbear2000,2007-04-05 01:06:00,25,Has anyone ever stayed at Camp La Plage on Lake Nipissing. Wanted to know how they were and how the fishing is in the area. Looks to be close to the hardwood Islands and Cache Bay and a few miles from the west arm.

55585,radar,2007-04-05 13:36:00,138,I work with a guy who has been going there for years and years. He's actually in one of their photos on their website.  He'd swear by the owners being great people and says the fishing is good (not mind blowing - but consistently good).
