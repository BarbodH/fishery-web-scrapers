55580,Guest gbfisher,2007-04-05 13:15:00,0,"MMMMm,,,,,,,,MMM   ....MUSKY STEAK!"
55584,misfish,2007-04-05 13:28:00,29133,I hear they taste better then pike. J/K  Great vid.
55586,Terry,2007-04-05 13:36:00,14456,I wonder how many were eaten and how many were thrown in the garden
55609,mdej,2007-04-05 14:34:00,98,"Thats a great video, thanks for posting the link."
55638,fishindevil,2007-04-05 15:14:00,6254,"WOW...thats very interesting , i wonder if they were trying to get musky caviar..lol..or trying to get eggs for stocking ,either way its very old film looks like in the early 40's or do you think late 30's...thanks for sharing that...cheers"
55690,lew,2007-04-05 16:34:00,12767,"Thanks Marc, that's a great old video with some very nice muskies, but I hafta tell you, I'm sure happy we changed our fishing habits years ago and got into C & R as opposed to keeping those toothies like we used to back in the day"
55775,ccmtcanada,2007-04-05 19:42:00,7971,Pretty cool to see old footage like that!
55779,Daplumma,2007-04-05 19:52:00,1961,"Thats good stuff,I am especially fond of the eye socket hold..Thats gotta hurt!Times sure have changed,thanx for the video. Joe"
55815,GbayGiant,2007-04-05 21:08:00,1780,"Must have been nice, probably only 100 muskie anglers in the whole world at that time."
55837,pameladallaire,2007-04-05 22:25:00,470,Cool
55991,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-06 10:26:00,621,"I thought some of you would like it,its nostalgia Thats from years back,look at the cars in the video  Lots of Fish Crisp moments  Ya Lew it is pretty good,when you factor in the number of anglers back then harvesting to todays CNR anglers and post mortal release,I kinda wonder if we are not causing more mortality in this day and age than yesteryear Yes some areas were affected heavily by harvest but overall today,our impact may be more significant than yesteryear's Cool oldie nonetheless"
56030,Bob,2007-04-06 13:49:00,370,"I see one car in there that looks like a 52 Chev or Pontiac.  Aside from the chrome, there was little difference between them up until about 56.  My second car was a 52 Chev, dang, I'm getting old I guess."
56032,sonny,2007-04-06 13:52:00,511,anyone evr eat a musky??  taste like pike???
56037,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-06 13:57:00,212,Why don't we wear suits anymore when we fish?  I guess that explains why it is the fish of 1000 casts today.
56053,OhioFisherman,2007-04-06 14:24:00,6623,"LOL my first trip to Ontario was in a 1953 Pontiac wagon in 1957, the roads are better now. The old pictures are cool but I am glad some things have changed. Fish back then were dead once caught, eaten, mounted, or freezer burnt and buried."
56060,Bob,2007-04-06 14:33:00,370,"My first trip to Burleigh Falls was in Dad's 29 Hudson. That was in 49 and they were fish of a thousand casts then. It was a rare treat to catch one.  Yes, we ate them, nothing wasted in those days.  They do taste similar to pike, they are pike, just get a little bigger and smellier."
56063,OhioFisherman,2007-04-06 14:37:00,6623,"LOL Bob they had cars back then? My brothers memory is a bit better than mine, our first trip was to Beaver lake, somewhere around Kingston?"
56115,Marc Thorpe,2007-04-06 16:17:00,621,Those were the days when Checkered shirts were cool I guess 10 000 cats wore em out
56146,lew,2007-04-06 17:18:00,12767," jeez Marc, are you saying checkered shirts AREN'T cool for musky fish'n anymore ??  "
