He got me the Chatterbait 26-Piece Kit consisting of:  the original revolutionary ChatterBait™ design, the new ChatterFrog™, Flippin’ ChatterCraw™, Mini ChatterBait™, ChatterStreak™, and ChatterFantail Minnow™ along with a variety of trailers and skirts  http://www.chatterbait.com/  Has anybody used this bait before?  How effective is it?  I can't wait to give it a shot on June 23, 2007 (the OPENER)!!!"
55952,Blake,2007-04-06 03:33:00,418,Tried them a bit last year with not too much success but they do look great in the water and I will give them a better shot this year.
55963,PatrickGG,2007-04-06 03:56:00,562,I picked up a bunch of Booyah chatterbaits at the spring fishing show i cant wait to give them a go.
55988,misfish,2007-04-06 10:13:00,29133,"I bought some last year. I like them,some reports came back as just a new lure to catch fishermen. You can fish them slow or fast spinnerbait retrieve style,jig them, hop them. I have yet to get a lunker on them,but have had acouple toothy critter steel two of them."
55996,mart,2007-04-06 11:02:00,93,I used them last year with average success for bass. Also caught a couple of musky on them too!! Once you catch a few fish on them you'll build a confidence in using them.
56001,spanky,2007-04-06 11:34:00,195,"used them alot last year... i don't buy spinnerbaits no more, hooked alot of fish... bass, pike and even a large 13"" perch, white w/silver worked best for me!!"
