I offered to let him try my different set ups but he wants to buy his own. Problem is, he only wants one set to start! He asked me what would I go for  as my ""ONE"" combo? Not sure if he casts left or right. Any suggestions would be most appreciated! I know what I like but am reluctant to make him do what I like. Anything to stay away from? Limit is approx. $300 for both.  Thanks, FT"

56214,GbayGiant,2007-04-06 19:49:00,1780,"The best starter combo IMO would be a St Croix Premier  7' MH with a Abu Garcia 6500 C3. Almost every musky hunter has at least one of these, but it would be an outstanding combo for a beginner or a pro. Not sure exact price but It will be in the $300 range. A lot of guys will tell you 1 rod won't do it and they are right, but with the 7' mh, it will work for bucktails, cranks and small jerk baits."
