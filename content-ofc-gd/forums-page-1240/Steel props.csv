55870,Skud,2007-04-06 00:28:00,739,Looking to get a steel prop for my Yamaha F60. My aluminum one is a 10 3/4 by 15. It has my motor reving at 5900-6000rpm so I would need about the same specs for a steel one. Anyone have a line on someone with reasonable prices?

56023,Guest skeeter99,2007-04-06 13:33:00,0,"hey skud   you can run a 15 or even 16 pitch on that boat  I had the 2 stroke 60 hp on a skketer ss90 and ran a 19 pitch but was a little slow in the hole  check kawartha prop for a good used one, maximum marine in port perry also  or ebay  below is a prop I picked up the other day $427 including the flo torq hub  it will be run on my skeeterss90 (16.5 foot) with a 90 merc currently running 52.3 mph on gps at 5900 rpms  with a 20 pitch laser 2 prop going to a 22 pitch laser 2 to get rpm down and gain maybe around 4 mile an hour**maybe**  should run about 55mph, the 2 increases in pitch will put me around 5500 rpm depending on trim setting  remember roughly for every increase in pitch you will loose 180-200 rpm's "
56106,Skud,2007-04-06 15:53:00,739,Good info Skeeter. My main purpose for a new prop is to get my rpm's down and a little more speed. With two men and eguipment I will run at 5900rpm and about 32-33mph. (1 man=6000rpm and 35mph)   I would like to get down to 5400-5500rpm(The optimuim for that motor is supposed to be 5330rpm for best gas mileage). Getting to 40mph would be nice but maybe not possible with 2 men.
56117,Guest skeeter99,2007-04-06 16:23:00,0,"only got 41.5 to 42 mph with my 60 yammie full of gas equipment  I had a 19 pitch prop on her  *stainless*  getting the rpm down saves gas and will save the engine over time  you would be suprised how much a prop makes a difference  you should look at a 4 blade stainless 16/17 pitch (the 4 blade prop have real good whole shot, but the best thing about them is that your boat runs alot higher in the water compared to a 3 blade, hence less boat in the water less drag = more speed  same boat as mine older 90hp runs 2.6 mph faster with 4 blade with same pitch as my 3 blade  it is more about physiscs than anything **every hull is different** unfortunately some bulit for speed others for comfort   there is a guy on the niagara river cannot remember the name, u go in take 5 or 6 props that he thinks would work on your particular boat well go and try them out and u can see what the different props will do to the boat and you take the one with the best performance    troy"
