55084,Bly,2007-04-04 04:06:00,1556,"Well, I had a few hours today while the little one was at school, so I threw my fishing gear in the car and headed to the local tackle store.  The weather held off, so maybe I could get a few hours in fishing!  While I was in the tackle store a gentleman and I were talking about the local steelhead spots.  He started explaining them to me and I jokingly said ""If you're heading there now, maybe I'll follow you in my car""...haha.  He said ""Why not?  I'll take you there and show you some of my favourite pools"".  I followed him in the car and we headed out to the trib.  He stayed about 20 minutes or so and showed me the spots before he left.  After a nice thank you, I headed back out to try out my luck with ccmt's noodle rod, fresh roe and net.  I went to the first hole he pointed out and had 2 hits within the first 15 to 20 minutes!!  The steelie apparently moved on from that spot, so I moved to a different location after scouting the current, water levels, clarity etc....  I found myself at a spot he didn't point out, but it looked promising to me.  Two drifts into this spot and my float went under!! I saw the fish, but he dove and spit the hook!!  A few more drifts, the float goes down and the same thing happened.  At least he hadn't moved on yet.  I changed up my roe bag to a different colour and continued drifting in that general area.  Finally...the float went down yet again and this time I didn't miss it!  FISH ON!  After a nice little battle, I landed this nice 22"" steelie!  Here's my pic...I suppose officially I went 1 for 3 on the day...my best day on the tribs yet.   This was a special day for me....a real confidence booster for me because I wasn't sure that I'd be able to land one without help.  Sorry team 9, my other fish beat this one, so no tourney entry."

55147,dheitzner,2007-04-04 11:33:00,314,"reel nice fish bly, the trib game is really one of confidence (as i've learned the last couple of years) so that fish should be special to you.  now that you know you can land one by yourself, lookout!"

55272,fishindevil,2007-04-04 16:23:00,6254,"CONGATS CAROL.  ..great report and nice pic of your steelie,way to go on landing her all by yourself...well you are definatley hooked no,you will want to go everyday...lol...lol"
55729,Josh Rogers,2007-04-05 17:29:00,79,Nice fish. It's always the best fishing when you are out by yourself in my opinion. You can concentrate on your presentation a little more and landing the fish by yourself just takes a little practice but once you start landing them without a net you'll want to do it all the time.  ATF
55911,Master of Bait,2007-04-06 02:09:00,196,"Bly - great job.  And happy birthday!  Gotta say there's something special about being out there on your own.  Must've felt so good landing that bad boy on your own.  CCMT, looks like it's time for a second noodle rod in the house!"
