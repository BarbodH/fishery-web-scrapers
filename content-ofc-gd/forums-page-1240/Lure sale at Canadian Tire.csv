55705,Hooked,2007-04-05 17:01:00,891,"Stopped by a Canadian Tire in Hamilton and picked up a few lures.  From what I've seen most CT's, not all, have this deal going on.  The following were on sale:  Wally Divers are $3.48 Grappling Shads $2.83 Rippling Redfins $3.44 Jitterbugs\Hula Poppers\Torpedos $3.53 CC Suspending Spot $1.83 Might be a few more, depending on which CT you go to.  At least the CT I went to, there still was a fair selection to pick from.  So if you are looking for the lures I mentioned, you maybe in luck, sale ends tomorrow (Friday).  Happy shopping."
55731,kennyman,2007-04-05 17:32:00,737,"I've been at the CTC in Brantford and they had totally different deals than the CTC in Kitchener. In Kitchener they have Gulp grubs (chartruese,white) on for $1.69. What a great deal ! They had the ""Bob Izumi signature series"" Walleye divers (and others) on sale in Brantford but I missed out so when I was in Kitchener I checked and they weren't on sale there? Different stores must have gotten different clearout merchandise. Wish they'd get some half priced Abu baitcaster reels LOL."

55783,xrap,2007-04-05 19:58:00,683,There's also soft baits and couple spools of line. Nothing special jsut a little basket. Not worth driving if you don't live in the Hammer.
