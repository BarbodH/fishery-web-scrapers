55542,brickNblock,2007-04-05 11:02:00,598,"I am also one that would like to say 'Sorry to Hear' this news Hookset. You have recieved some exellent options from members here.....some whom have experienced this mess before and others who sound entirely proffessional with their advice. Whatever it was that you paid for your piece of paradise..It sounds like approaching the developers early to see what interest they may be willing to shell out for your property may be the way to go if you come out as the winner in that respect......I realize that more money(then cost), doesnt replace paradise...but it may enable you to purcahse another paradise...maybe one with waterfront as mentioned. How long before the proposed development to start ? I dont remember what member said it...but getting in early in the planning stages sounds like a MUST DO !, if selling to them is a route you may travel. Best of luck........this is one thread we'll be keeping track of.  On a lighter side...I hope this doesnt interfere with your fishing too much...we need the inches Bud!"
55552,OhioFisherman,2007-04-05 11:36:00,6623,"They old saying ""you can`t fight city hall"" it just takes more money than most people have, and they know it!"
55558,Garyv,2007-04-05 11:54:00,547,"I'm not surprised with the results, in fact it's what I expected based on our experience in our area.  By appeal they mean OMB and the first go around won't cost to much, however based on my attendance at many of these appeals the OMB will normally side with the developer especially if the municipality has no objections which brings you to the 2nd appeal and now it gets costly.  Hate to say it but in the end you will probably loose and be out the dollars it costs to go through the process.  Best advice above is to approach the developer ( perhaps through a real estate broker or attorney )  and see if they are interested in you property and if so, what kind of offer the are willing to give you.  It would really help if the other objector will do the same.  You going in from a position of weakness but not as much as after the condos are built.   Good Luck!"
55613,Tacklebuster,2007-04-05 14:46:00,303,"We are dealing with a similar situation here in Oakville.  You have to get a coalition together, and raise issues that would force the land owner and township to basically jump through hoops in order to get the construction plans approved.  Some of the issues that were already mentioned are: environmental impact (which may come from various sources:Light polution, noise, etc.), increase in traffic which may pose a threat to children or pedestrians which may require the town to install street lights or traffic lights, etc.  You have to get as many concerned residents together and brainstorm."
55669,Cast-Away,2007-04-05 15:53:00,790,"Wow that is too bad Hookset. I'm suprised that the meeting was held so soon after receiving the letter. They are suppose to give you a number of weeks notice so that you can prepare an arguement and present it to council. You should look into this.  If all else fails, do you think that the new land owner would be interested in your property?"
55736,jeffya2,2007-04-05 17:52:00,6,"Don't be discouraged as this is a normal 1st step. Your councils job is always to find more revenue so why would they not initially agree. Your job is to get organized with some numbers. Next you should retain a lawyer & Planner with very little money down. Then you must send a ""Registered Letter"" stating that they will be handling all appeal actions {Should be from one of the professionals} & requesting minutes of every meeting concerning this proposal. You can stop this process @ any phase but are cheap moves to ensure every angle will be scrutinized without great expense to you. Don't forget that many developers buy & submit many proposals in various area's  intending on taking the path of least resistance & many also capitulate @ lengthy delays & resistance  Now your council will take you seriously, have to review every phase & step legally as well as well as from the ""Official Plan"" view, & address traffic, drainage, MOE, MOT etc. This will likely force many studies to be undertaken & paid for by the Developer. These studies may become your best ammunition & often will reveal issues that will cost the Township money. Sometimes new revealed expenses like upgrading roads, Sewers, etc will turn a council against a project  I want to lastly point out that when I 1st got involved there were 7 councilors in favor & 5 years later {with a new council} we took the developer to OMB with 7 councilors opposed. If you get well organized it will become a long process probably 5 years + believe it or not OMB is more Sympathetic  towards citizens rights then developers & township greed  Lastly by fighting & being visible the developer will more likely be interested in purchasing your house for a more then fair price as it's cheaper then endless studies & hurddles"
55960,grt1,2007-04-06 03:50:00,638,"Many of the posts have given you excellent advice. From my point of view, as a former town councillor and mayor, If the municipality has an official plan that has been approved by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, the zoning is probably in place to allow this development.  So when it comes to the local council actually listening to the current residents of the area, I wish and hope they do, but, with so much downloading on the municipal taxpayers having happened, the chances are they are looking at the increased assessment to the local tax base and what it will do for their future ability to provide services to the municipality.  Good Luck and be sure to contact the lawyer that was mentioned that specialized in OMB issues."
55137,pikehunter,2007-04-04 10:57:00,1659,"Too bad, a fight to save what you have is not something to look forward to. I guess the answer really is that if you live next to vacant property near a growing community you have to expect it to be developed some day. That is very unfortunate and sad to say the least.  Maybe this is a simpler solution: FOR SALE. Start looking for a new paradise. If the developer has deep pockets I wish you well with your fight. Anybody who has witnessed the fight in Burlington Ontario over Walmart's new store will agree as Walmart ended up winning when the city ran out of money to continue the war."
55169,John,2007-04-04 12:36:00,2956," Unfortunately Burlington was fighting a war that it could not win. It really had nothing to do with running out of money. Why plow another 1/2 mil into legal fees when it was a done deal.  Seems to me that Muskoka is past the point of no return when it comes to development. I have a cousin who is a general contractor on Lake of Bays and unfortunately fractional ownerships and condo's are being approved on an ongoing basis. As there is an existing development with a private road, I don't think that your battle is winnable either.  I hope that I'm wrong...."
55277,Hookset,2007-04-04 16:40:00,367,"Hi All,  Just wanted to send a BIG THANKYOU to all who replied. When I showed my girlfriend all of the educated and informative replies that I printed off, I could tell what she was thinking.... ""You got all this from an Ontario fishing website ????!!!!"" I have taken points from Rick, Lookin for Walleye, mdej, Cast-Away, Aplumma, OhioFisherman, Pikehunter, John, Garyv, and jeffya2, and have used them to arm myself for tonight's meeting. Lenray, if I had enough money to buy all that property I'd be living somewhere else, namely waterfront property. Terry and jjcanoe, I will use your composting / abbotoir ideas when all else fails, thanks for the laugh though, we needed it. If I have missed anyone, my apologies. All the info. I gathered from other sources doesn't measure to a hill of beans compared to what I got from the OFC members. Win or lose I'm better armed now than I could have expected. I am one who believes that unless you fight for what you think is right, you have no reason to complain.  Thanks again everyone.  Hookset."
55281,John,2007-04-04 16:47:00,2956,"Hi Hookset, I wish you well. Keep up informed..."
55291,lew,2007-04-04 17:16:00,12767,"Best of luck tonite Hookset, and it'd be good to hear how you make out."
55347,aplumma,2007-04-04 19:56:00,6896,Good luck bud and take the info they give you and cut the best deal you can.   Art
55388,Big Cliff,2007-04-04 21:29:00,6899,"Sorry I didn't get to reply sooner, might even be too late but my wife worked for a planning dept for a number of years and she could perhaps help you to at least know some of the ropes. If youare still in the process please let me know and I will see if we can at least point you in the right direction. You might not get what you want but at least you will know you didn't go to a gun fight with a knife!"
55466,Hookset,2007-04-05 01:15:00,367,"Well, we just got back from the meeting. We were one of two families presenting ""against"" the change to the zoning bylaw. Regardless of what we presented, argued or defined as issues, we were basically told that all of those arguments could be presented in the ""appeals"" process and that a vote by council would be made tonight. Vote the council did. 100 % of the council, mayor included, voted in favor of changing the zoning. You would almost think the decision was made beforehand   . We now have 20 days within which to make an appeal, so we see our choices limited to this : (1) We either fight to the end, and appeal our butts off. (2) We start the process of preparing to sell. Either way is pretty difficult. To afford a lawyer is one issue, but to be only one of two families opposed against a corporation with total town council support is another thing. Looks like the little guys took a kick to the teeth in the first round. Right now we feel like we will fight using the appeals process best we can on our own, and while doing so, try and sell (privately or to the developer).  In the end, if the Condo's are going to be built (40 units, 4 stories high) there is no way we could stay. Right now our property faces out onto a busy street. We knew that when we moved in. We have a road going to the current Condo's on our south border. With the development we would have another road abutting our north side and a parking lot abutting to our east side. Surrounded by pavement in what used to be a very park like setting. Hell, we even had deer in our backyard several times this past year. Doubt we'll see them again. Anyway, we know what has been dealt us, we appreciate all the support and replies we have received from OFC'ers but right now it looks like one of those crappy deals you get dealt when dealing with town councils, tax dollars, and corporations. I need a beer and a good fishing story.  Hookset."
55479,pikehunter,2007-04-05 01:43:00,1659,"Sorry to hear that it didn't go in your favour. Sometimes I think that town/city councils are only interested in the added tax money that will be generated by new housing, retail and industrial developments. Plus all the new voters moving into their ridings.  This is happening everywhere, some call it progress.   I don't agree with this diagnosis. If you decide to move on I wish you success with the sale and the search for a new home. So much property is being swallowed by development, and so much of it is being taken up with multiple dwellings."
55488,irishfield,2007-04-05 02:00:00,26272,"Sorry to hear Hookset...but like Pikehunter says, all the township sees is tax dollars and yes the re-zone was decided LONG before the info meeting.  Penetang and Midland are both perfect examples of only ""seeing"" tax dollars. Both harbours water fronts have been ruined by re-zoning and multi-story eye sores on the waterfront that was originally green space, in a town with 2 story max building code. Now the 4/5 story waterfronts are blocking views of the water to even people part way up the escarpement."
55492,Bernie,2007-04-05 02:07:00,3190,Very sorry for you hookset. My heart would sink if it happened here as well. I can only imagine how you feel right now. Keep hearing about our area becoming the next Muskoka. Hope its not in my lifetime.
55497,pikehunter,2007-04-05 02:21:00,1659,"""Pave paradise and put up a parking lot, put all the trees in a tree museum and charge the people a buck and a half just to see them."""
