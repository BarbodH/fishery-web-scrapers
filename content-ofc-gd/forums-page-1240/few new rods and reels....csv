55797,Raf,2007-04-05 20:18:00,3495,look for a 7' medium heavy for the 4600c3.   Pretty sure there is Clarus in those specs.

55813,bassman,2007-04-05 21:04:00,384,"I agree with Raf, I've got a 7' medium heavy Clarus. If you're fishing in the slop try a 7'6"" flipping stick. It's got lots of backbone, and it could double up as a pike and musky rod."
