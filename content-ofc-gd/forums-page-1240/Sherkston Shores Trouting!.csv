55077,charlied,2007-04-04 03:25:00,584,"Went to sherkston for some trout...was there about 2.5 hours and managed to land about 25 and lost a few more....here are a few pics of the fish!  I am super glad to see the trout lasted the winter and were hungry and feisty as heck!    I think its worth the $6 to get in, I have never taken a fish home.  I just love to catch them!"
55081,huntervasili,2007-04-04 03:57:00,1604,WTG.. looks like you had a fun time with those little buggers....
55091,charlied,2007-04-04 04:20:00,584,"yep lots of little ones in there.....and some very large ones, some over 10 pounds...but don't think they can beat the smaller ones to the bait...LOL"
55092,ccmtcanada,2007-04-04 04:20:00,7971,Nice job out there!     Gotta love how scrappy they are...nothing gets the adrenaline going more than seeing that float go down and then seeing it jump out of the water.

55171,tonyb,2007-04-04 12:47:00,1637,"Oh man, I'd be filling a bucket!! with 5 of those tasty little guys."
55220,valerie,2007-04-04 14:32:00,83,Nice fish and pics . If you dont mind me asking where is sherkston shores?    :Gonefishing:
55307,charlied,2007-04-04 18:11:00,584,"Sherkston shores is in between  Port Colbourne and Fort Erie.  It is an old quarry that they hit the water line on and it filled many  many years ago.  And now the stock it with Rainbows, browns and speckles.  And if you lucky enough there are some big bass in there, caught a 3 pounder yesturday and last summer I got a couple 4 pounders.  It costs $6 to get in and you are only allowed to keep 2 fish.  The $6 entry fee goes back to help stock it every year or put minnows in for the trout."
55359,Heybud_e,2007-04-04 20:35:00,208,"i have been there before!!! actually i used to live down the road from the park and used to fish there in the quarry, never tried shore fishing on the beaches.... there is aLOT of everything in there i imagine, many bass have been pulled out of there,   say... do they still have the castaways bar in there???  Great pics by the way"
55365,luv2drift,2007-04-04 20:50:00,147,What set up do you use?
55373,cplummer,2007-04-04 21:02:00,165,my derby (take a kid fishing)  is being held there on the 21st of april... I went with my wife and son on monday and we landed 77 trout  with the biggest being 5 lbs.. went with bones on tues and we landed 62 rainbows and a nice brown... minnows under a fixed float 8' down was the ticket.. cliff...
55575,valerie,2007-04-05 12:58:00,83,Thanks Charlied i'll have to give it a try oneday
55590,valerie,2007-04-05 13:51:00,83,Hey charlied i was just wondering if you have any advice on what spots i should fish not asking for your favorite spots just some help and what bait would you suggest. Thanks rob
55709,charlied,2007-04-05 17:03:00,584,"well the most productive thing is minnow under a float about 6-8 feet under it and let it sit, and you can try even on bottom, with the weight on bottom and hook up line about 1-2 feet...may sound plain but the smack the heck out of it.   Later on around say june/July you can try little spinners, and spinners even work for the smallmouth in there too.  Your best bet would be to just pic a  place to try and move around cause they are all over the quarry, there is something like over 50,000  trout in there I think."
55718,valerie,2007-04-05 17:10:00,83,Do you still have to follow the reg's seeing that its a pay to enter park or can you fish all year for any species. Thanks rob
55751,charlied,2007-04-05 18:38:00,584,because its private you can fish all year there...as long as there is no ice.....once the ice forms fishing is closed....the insurance costs are way to high to have it open when there is ice there.
55776,valerie,2007-04-05 19:42:00,83,Thanks have a great weekend everyone.
55843,charlied,2007-04-05 22:44:00,584,You too!
