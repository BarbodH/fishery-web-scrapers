171445,irishfield,2008-03-14 19:00:00,26272,That'll buff right out !
171448,Raf,2008-03-14 19:07:00,3495,  adds character?
171454,maybe,2008-03-14 19:41:00,307,"A few rolls of duct tape, and she'll be good as new.  Glad you're ok, Cliff!"
171456,Kirk,2008-03-14 19:47:00,347,"Obviously Cliff if you were travelling just a bit faster, this whole collision could have been avoided..."
171463,Garry2Rs,2008-03-14 20:10:00,1425,Wipe it over with a damp rag.
171471,Cory,2008-03-14 20:54:00,170,"good thing you didn't get hit by Chuck Norris, would have been nothing left."
171509,Casey123,2008-03-14 22:31:00,461,"I have to agree with Kirk.  By the looks of the picture this whole accident is really your fault.  Had you been going 2km/hr quicker, you would have never been in the guy going through the red lights' way.  Anway, glad to hear you are all right, how is the casting shoulder?"
171528,musky_man,2008-03-14 22:59:00,159,Sounds like a lot of guys on this site watch Red Green :}
