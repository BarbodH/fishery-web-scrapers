Anyone have any suggestions? I was thinkin Erindale Park on the Credit but I wasn't sure if it was still open.  One more thing, can you renew your fishin license at CTC? Or do I have to hit a Tackle Shop?  Thanks,  Dave"
171972,shane,2008-03-16 01:00:00,652,I have renewed my license at CT every year for years.  And I will this year too.  As for where to go fishing?.........I don't know.  But good luck anyhow.
171975,bigreddog,2008-03-16 01:09:00,84,Erindale Park is open all year round.  Might be a good idea to pick up a copy of this year's regs when you go to CT to renew your license.
171979,shane,2008-03-16 01:21:00,652," That's a good point.  Usually, my first trip of the year would be on the Thames around here somewhere,  but I just heard on the news that this area is closed for walleye this year.  If I hadn't heard it on tv, I wouldn't have known."
