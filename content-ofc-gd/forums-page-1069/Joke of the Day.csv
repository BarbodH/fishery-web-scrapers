171459,Kirk,2008-03-14 19:57:00,347,"A gas station owner in Newfoundland was trying to increase his sales. So, he put up a sign that read, 'Free Sex with Fill-Up.'  Soon a Newfi pulled in, filled his tank and asked for his free sex. The owner told him to pick a number from 1 to 10. If he guessed correctly, he would get his free sex. the newfi guessed 8, and the proprietor said, 'You were close. The number was 7. Sorry. No sex this time.'  A week later, the newfi, along with his friend, another newfi, pulled in for another fill-up. Again he asked for his free sex. The proprietor again gave him the same story, and asked him to guess the correct number. the newfi guessed 2 this time. The proprietor said, 'Sorry, it was 3. You were close, but no free sex this time.'  As they were driving away, the first newfi said to the other, 'I think that game is rigged and he doesn't really give  away free sex.' the second newfi replied, 'No it ain't, . It's not rigged at all. My wife won twice last week.'"
