171809,lew,2008-03-15 18:49:00,12767,"I'm ordering an item from the States, but the company doesn't know what the duty charges will cost me and I was wondering if anyone would have a rough estimate.  The item is about 28 pounds with a value of $150 + taxes and is being shipped by USPS and the shipping charge is $15  I  don't expect the duty will be too much but I hate surprises....any thoughts ??"
171810,irishfield,2008-03-15 18:52:00,26272,If it was made in the USA/Mexico Lew there'll be no duty... Since it's coming via the post office... $5 customs + tax collection of value in Cdn funds. Now if they screw up and ship it UPS... they spin the crown and anchor wheel and the last one I got nailed for $71 brokerage....
171814,lew,2008-03-15 19:01:00,12767,"Thanks Wayne, it's made ""offshore"" as they say, and the company only ships via USPS, so I spose there won't be any hidden surprises........jeeeeez, I hate those surprises"
171820,Mike the Pike,2008-03-15 19:03:00,3421,Jeez Lew thats one heavy duty Muskie reel you bought there
171821,irishfield,2008-03-15 19:04:00,26272,If customs is awake.. you may get hit for duty.. depending on what and what country. Might add another 2 to 8 %
171853,SlowPoke,2008-03-15 20:12:00,2984," Lew got his reel at the show, he's importing a 28lb spinnerbait."

171891,GbayGiant,2008-03-15 22:30:00,1780,"Yeah, it's usually not bad but if those damn brokerage firms hit you it's ridiculous. I've honestly had shipments where the brokerage charged me more than the actual duty ? they pay the duty without asking you and then charge you 150% on top of the duty.  I have no idea how they get away with it, must be bank owned businesses.  I usually just add 13% to the final total of the purchase and figure that's what will be the final price when I get it at my door or close to that and decide whether it's still a deal at that price, sometimes customs miss it and you pay nothing, but not to often."
171894,Gerritt,2008-03-15 22:35:00,6129,Lew PM me if you have brokerage issues.... I have a brokerage account and the costs are nowhere near what UPS would charge...We order TONS of stuff from the states..  I am always here and will reply in short order... PS... UPS will bend you over backwards and not even kiss you when they are done...  Let me know if there are any issues and I will get it brokered for you.  G
171911,lew,2008-03-15 23:17:00,12767,"Thanks for the offer Gerritt, but it's coming by U.S. mail so there shouldn't be any brokerage fees, and I believe the duty is all I need to pay, 'cept for taxes."
171915,silveradosheriff,2008-03-15 23:25:00,1025, Come on Lew - should have got the 40lb'er.......
171919,brickNblock,2008-03-15 23:29:00,598,Lew.....I get material from Staminainc and RollienHellens and usually only about 17% of my total cost  total..and it is shipped by post. Best of luck with yours Bud.
171920,SlowPoke,2008-03-15 23:32:00,2984,"Lew is almost 50, he's downsizing his baits"
171934,lew,2008-03-15 23:47:00,12767,"Yup, I'm only 10 years from 50 Brian, cept it's on the wrong side"
171944,Jeff R,2008-03-16 00:04:00,94,"Hey Lew,  if it hasn't shipped yet, I got and address you can send it to in Mich. Will be down there next weekend, and g/f will be down following weekend...won't be as fast as direct, but I don't charge duty...  Jeff"
171952,lew,2008-03-16 00:24:00,12767,"Thanks for the offer Jeff, very generous of you but it's already been shipped out.  I'm saving $70 off the top so a bit of duty won't be too bad"
