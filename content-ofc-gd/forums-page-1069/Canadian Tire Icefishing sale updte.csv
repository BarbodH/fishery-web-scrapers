171526,ketchenany,2008-03-14 22:54:00,3229,I just got word that the Bowmanville store has 2 power augers in stock.  Sorry I didn't ask about the tent.   Quote from the GM.  I have 78-8328 for $262.49 which is half price.  2 of them.  Sale ends next Friday.
171538,muskymike,2008-03-14 23:16:00,772,I just saw the flyer but do they have anything buy ice fishing equipment on sale?
171548,bbog,2008-03-14 23:43:00,665,Power auger at the Leslie & Lakeshore and Markham and Lawrence location. Markham and Lawrence also had a couple Frabill huts at $250 (as of late this afternoon). A sale of odds and ends with a number of ice fishing items but certainly not an ice fishing clearance.  Sale is on for TWO weeks not one as reported previously.  Good luck in getting what you seek.
171555,irishfield,2008-03-15 00:05:00,26272,Here's the link to the fishing clearance items. Even have the ABU 6500C3 on half price.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/subcateg...408474396675848
171560,irishfield,2008-03-15 00:20:00,26272,Gunnison Float Tube is also half price $75 if you look in the sports section of the clearance sale section.  Lot of PFD's on sale... ratchet straps for boat transom (the kind that mount to trailer permanantly...GERRITT !)

171638,pooch,2008-03-15 03:16:00,139,I picked up one of the 2 man frabill trekker portable huts. Great deal. Thanks to OFNrs for highlighting the sale. There was one jiffy auger left at the Lansdowne ptbo location at 3:00 pm Friday. I had to summon all my will power not to take it home too.

172000,superdad,2008-03-16 02:25:00,353,"When I was at the big CTC in Kingston this morning around 1045, the young guy told the Fishing Dept Mgr, that the fish-huts were gone....  The Mgr. told me that they had sold seven power augers since 0900 - they were walking out the place.  What a sale - I guess.  David  aka Superdad"
172002,danc,2008-03-16 02:32:00,4677,The GPS is not such a great deal. But I did buy 3 pairs of vise grips today at 30% off.
