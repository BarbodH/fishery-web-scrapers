They believed at the time that a tornado had damage the downtown area and ""interrupted a basketball game"".  I can't believe that they were able to finish the game.  Looked like a lot of debris on the street and a lot of people standing around.  CNN only mentioned injuries and no deaths.  Hopefully there were no serious injuries and all the people affected by the tornado are ok.  Tom."
