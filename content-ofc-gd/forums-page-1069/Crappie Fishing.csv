He told me I didn't understand and that he was talking about a species called Crappie and not fish that are crappie. OK.. so now I think I kind of understand   So I was wondering if anyone could help me out, I am looking for a good crappie hole this spring (April) in S.W. Ontario. Any Suggestions?  Thanks,  OlTroll"
