171875,B Diddy,2008-03-15 21:31:00,33,Was thinking of taking the kids out on the ice tomorrow to see if we can catch a couple.  Just wondering if the ice is still safe to take the atv out.  Was going to try out from Lefroy.  Any insight would be great.  Bill

171899,bbog,2008-03-15 22:41:00,665,not a good time to try out my new manual auger (CTC special)
171954,B Diddy,2008-03-16 00:25:00,33,Better get eating some spinnach.  Manual auger for us buddies.  Guess it's plenty safe still for a couple atv's

171963,bbog,2008-03-16 00:41:00,665,Taking the misses out for a shot at Perch and maybe Mr. Pike if he shows up  Would rather she didn't have to work so hard with the manual auger
