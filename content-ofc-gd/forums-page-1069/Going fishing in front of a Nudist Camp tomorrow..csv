171715,kickingfrog,2008-03-15 13:14:00,8333,The camp director wasn't wearing a helmet while riding a snowmobile?
171720,Beans,2008-03-15 13:24:00,3339,LOL  I don't see our pal Brit Steve in the pics...Maybe he is out in his little dinghy chumming corn...
171724,crappieperchhunter,2008-03-15 13:29:00,2582,Beansie...you beat me to it. I was looking for Brit Steve as well...LOL.
171744,irishfield,2008-03-15 14:54:00,26272, He didn't need to be...as reading thru that website quickly it appears he may very well be on private property! Camp has been there since the 20's... 640 acres surrounding a 100 acre lake.  Hope Randy's not the one with the tresspassing charge when he comes home...
171745,Rich Clemens,2008-03-15 14:57:00,3131,We'll be waiting for a complete and detail report. Oh yeah ... be sure to check out the catch and POSESSION limits.
171756,maybe,2008-03-15 15:30:00,307,"I understand that standard naturism etiquette is ""when in rome.""  If you're going to insert yourself into their activity, (un)dress accordingly or leave.  Sporting a towel rack in public is also considered bad form.  Not trying to be mean here, but on a really basic level, it seems awfully selfish to upset other people just for one's own amusement.  Interfering with someone's activities, or creating an intimidating/hostile/offensive environment, by means of sexual attention that you know is unwanted...is called sexual harassment.  Given the heated thread a while back about swearing in front of children being bad, I'm confused as to why harassing people is being endorsed.  I think if a couple of strange men spent the afternoon in front of your house taking pictures of your daughter/wife/mother, you'd be pretty upset.  Would you really want them to say ""you don't own the sidewalk - we'll be back with our friends and more cameras next week""?  Would you want other men trading pictures of your daughter's ""assets"" as porn?  If it were me, I'd be glad to give these people as much space as they need to feel comfortable.  Same common courtesy I try to extend to anybody else, on or off the water."
171775,Terry,2008-03-15 17:08:00,14456,"if there is a hydro right of way to the lake then you have every right to be there but  if you have to cross private land..then shame on you  but he didn't call the cops, so I would think you did access it only on right of ways..so go for it  is it long enough to land a plane....LOL"
171788,Moosebunk,2008-03-15 17:48:00,3970,"My guess is this response is too late anyway, but...  I'll agree with Tangledlines here I think.  Reason being, with 40,000+ lakes in the province do you really have to be a nuisance on one little 100 acre lake.  C'mon... these people are doing what they want to do peacefully with their priziks and booty out.  Do you guys really feel the need to just be priziks over a few pics?  Nuthin personal, just my $0.02."
171807,Big Cliff,2008-03-15 18:41:00,6899,Just because you CAN do something it doesn't always make it right. I think that for the most part I agree with TangledLines. Now that you know the situation do you really feel that you want to invade someone elses space and privicy. If you saw another boat fishing on a lake would you move in close enough to ruin their enjoyment? I'll bet you wouldn't! It's called respect and I think that from reading many of your posts that respect is something you appreciate and value.
171998,Muskieman,2008-03-16 02:23:00,2472,Well I wen out to the Lake today and had fantastic time ...  I wasn't harassed by any naked people... They left yesterday.  We had a great day the Walleye action didn't stop.  a few pics... In one of these you can clearly see the pole line we came in from behind me..The north shore of the lake is Nipissing First Nation land.. and has a pole line and OFSC trail running through it.  All in all we kept 16 fish out of 27{4 of us} caught....enough for Good Friday Fishfry .  Randy
172001,Muskieman,2008-03-16 02:28:00,2472,... I would not have been disrespectful had I been approached by naked people or naturalists..  had there been naked people there I wasn't planning on taking pictures of them..
172006,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-16 02:43:00,1183,"Nice to hear from you...funny how this particular issue stuck in my head all day...the longer it took for you to post, the more concerned I got Enjoy your catch."
172010,Greencoachdog,2008-03-16 03:01:00,8163," Ok!... but what if the guy out on the sidewalk in front of your house has his back to your house the whole time and isn't paying any attention to you or your family? Let's say he's taking pictures, collecting samples and studing a type of Ant in the gutter that connects the sidewalk to the road. Sure, you'll go out there and ask him what he's doing... but what are you going to say when he tells you exactly what he's doing?  Also, who in their right mind would be prancing around outside in the nude in freezing weather with snow and ice all around? That would be a real good way to lose very valuable body parts to frostbite! The naked guy on the snowmobile sounds a little far-fetched to me, but I guess it could happen."
171501,Muskieman,2008-03-14 22:19:00,2472,"EH!   I'm going fishing on Family Jewel Lake tomorrow ... There is a Nudist Camp there and is occupied for March break... they have a private road to get there with 2 gates.  We are going in from a pole line over Crown Land with our ATV's .  My friend went for the first time last weekend and did very very good...awesome Walleye .  The ""Camp Director""  jumped on his snowmachine wearing nothing but a toque and boots and drove up to him.. told him that he wasn't allowed to fish there because he was ruining the sanctity of their festivities...my buddy asked him to prove he owned the lake and would be back the next weekend...[that's tomorrow]....he left on his snowmachine...My buddy kept fishin. The guy came back fully clothed and accompanied by another man .. Harassed my buddy for 10 minutes , they stopped when he threatened to call the cops.  I'm expecting this tomorrow....  I checked the MNR rule book and found no laws about ""sanctity""..  Now . my question is.... What would do?  I'm bringing my camera.  I'd post the link to their site ...but... I wanna preserve the sanctity of my new fishin hole.    Randy"
171505,Daplumma,2008-03-14 22:24:00,1961,"Take pictures to ""document"" any harrassment.I just got back from fishing  a topless beach area.I had the camera ready for such a situation but the topless ones didn't seem to care bout me fishing there.Took pictures anyway,just in case!  Joe"
171506,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-14 22:27:00,2585,bring your camera for sure lol  Cheers!
171508,Gerritt,2008-03-14 22:30:00,6129,JOE PM ME!!!! I need to send you my email address!!!!!   Ohhhh and Randy... I expect a FULL.... I stress FULL report w/ pics... remember we like pics... Mmmm porn... Errr I mean fish porn!!! ..... really I do!   G
171514,silveradosheriff,2008-03-14 22:34:00,1025,Remember to wear protective eyewear!
171520,waterwolf,2008-03-14 22:43:00,556,"this could get interesting, better reserve a seat at the computer tomorow night for this report.  hostile nudies,pickeral fisherman ,,, you don't see that mix too often."
171524,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-14 22:48:00,1183,"I miss the point...is it the guy with the toque and boots that is bringing you men back...are ya both itching for an altercation...or could it be the anticipation of seeing ""white boobie clouds""...or just loads of things that dangle...."
171525,Casey123,2008-03-14 22:52:00,461,"Randy,  I don't see the attraction of fishing with naked men on snow mobiles chasing me....  Please explain"
171529,Ben_Daniels,2008-03-14 22:59:00,435,  Hahahahaha
171534,Muskieman,2008-03-14 23:06:00,2472,this is a lake that only has access during the winter... I know of nobody who's fished it in the past 20 yrs or so...other than my buddy last weekend.  we'll go overland by ATV and snowmachine.  access is only permitted to members during the summer..... and I aint joining that club..  the lake is surrounded by muskeg which makes summer access nearly impossible.  I hope to not get harassed....by naked people on snowmachines....if they do it will be short lived not exactly gonna be warm tomorrow.
171540,waterwolf,2008-03-14 23:19:00,556, don't think randy said it was an all male resort .
171543,highdrifter,2008-03-14 23:33:00,2534,"Hey Randy!  When you get there, if you spot any nudies coming, just get nakid with them!  You'd be nekid, they'd be nekid...  Ya'll could have a nekid party and a nekid fish fry afterwards!!  And certainly, don't forget the camera ahaah  yyeeeeeee H to the D"
171556,pikehunter,2008-03-15 00:07:00,1659,"Strip down and maybe they'll have nothing to say. Just a thought.  I didn't think they would be racing around in their birthday suites in the winter, real die-hard nudists I guess."
171557,irishfield,2008-03-15 00:12:00,26272,Was probably hoping the sight alone would scare them off Harry !
171559,pikehunter,2008-03-15 00:20:00,1659,"Yeah, you're probably right Wayne!   Something like that just might scare me away!"
171562,irishfield,2008-03-15 00:25:00,26272,"Now if he had of said "" you wanna join us in the bunk house"" instead of ""get off my lake""... It probably would have worked !"
171565,GbayGiant,2008-03-15 00:36:00,1780,Which head was the toque on ? a guy can get serious frost bite out there. If anything the guy probably didn't look to threatening after that little ride out on the sled with a minor case of shrivelitus.
171567,fishindevil,2008-03-15 00:53:00,6254,"Man ohhhh, Man i thought i heard it all,about that bum kicking machine !!!!.  ..now im hearing about nekid,land owners at a nudy resort on snow machines !!!.  ..man this is all too much in one day....randy you gotta keep us really informed about this,and pictures as well,....we need to see a few nekid walleyes as well....cheers and hope you come back with all your clothes on man !!!! GOOD-LUCK BUD         i think i need a drink or 2,or 3,...and so on"
171570,shane,2008-03-15 00:54:00,652, HAHAHA!  I use a similar technique on the Jehova's Witnesses.
171571,Rizzo,2008-03-15 00:55:00,4754,"I suggest you ""match the hatch"".  This will require you to use a purple wiggler for bait, pretty sure the fish have seen plenty of those.  Oh yes, make sure its a shriveled purple wiggler, that water is bloody cold (that's always my excuse)"
171589,Muskieman,2008-03-15 01:18:00,2472,    I blew BEER out my nose..
171615,Greencoachdog,2008-03-15 02:19:00,8163,I say take the camera for the fish only!  It has been my past experience that the ones that want to show it to you are the ones you don't want to see!!!
171651,huey graphite,2008-03-15 04:38:00,362,"If the guy on the snow machine shows up again, tell him ""You're just in time. We just used our last worm"" and than give a glance ""below"". That should scare him off!"
171653,huey graphite,2008-03-15 04:40:00,362,"One more thing.......while you're there, if you drop you're fishing gear, just kick it in the hole and go buy a replacement."
171679,OhioFisherman,2008-03-15 11:30:00,6623,If they give you a hard time shake your nightstick at them!
