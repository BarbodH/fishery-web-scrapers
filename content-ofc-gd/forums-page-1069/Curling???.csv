Now I have nothing against curling, or curling fans but why is it that TSN will cover curling for 3-4 hours at a time, and the max coverage they'll give to a fishing show is 30 minutes? I'd love to see a 3-4 hour Bass Tournament on TSN. I know that WFN has plenty of fishing tourney's, but not all cable subscribers get WFN. There has to be 10x as many people that fish in Canada vs people that curl.  Is the quality of fishing tourney coverage that bad, or just not interesting?  Thoughts?"
