171762,urbanangler1990,2008-03-15 16:11:00,933,"oh man good luck, i was planning to go this morning but couldnt wake, maybe this afternoon :S"
171791,mepps,2008-03-15 17:55:00,1301,"Good luck , cant wait to see some pike!  And as far as I'm concerned, it's not stealing if they don't bother to put security on their wireless"
171800,lew,2008-03-15 18:26:00,12767,"Best of luck Bill, but why on earth did you take your puter on a fishin trip ??"
171802,irishfield,2008-03-15 18:29:00,26272," Especially when the hotel advertises right on their marque... ""Free High Speed Internet"""
171806,BillM,2008-03-15 18:40:00,17367," Google earth is great for finding fishing holes   Plus I don't know Toronto to well so atleast I have some kind of gameplan, lol  No fish to report, no follows, nothing.   Perhaps the water is a tad bit to cold for these fish yet, ah well..  Felt great tossing the baitcaster..  Weather is awesome down here, if anyone is planning on giving it a shot, today is the day...   (Still stealing wireless  )"
171808,fishindevil,2008-03-15 18:47:00,6254,"WOW...technology eh !!!!!...fishing with your lap-top..  .oh well good luck,and hope you get a big early spring pike !!!!....cheers"
