171402,mattyk,2008-03-14 16:56:00,2110,"Howdy Yall  I was thinking of picking up a new musky rod this year for throwing some heavy jerkbaits like 10"" weighted suicks, mantas and hellhounds. I currently have a 7'6 XH Shimano Compre but its too big. What do you guys like for throwing the jerkbaits?  I will be probably be using it with a ABU C3 6500, but im not sure. I want to keep it under $200 if possible for the rod. Thanks for the help!"

171406,irishfield,2008-03-14 17:08:00,26272,What Raf said... love mine.  PM69XHF - 3 to 8oz (baits) - 30 to 80lb
171418,lew,2008-03-14 17:38:00,12767,"I like a shorter rod  too Matt and use a 6' 6"" Premier.  Some guys like to go with a longer rod for jerkbaits though, all depends how you like to work your baits...out to the side or straight down in front."
171435,Fang,2008-03-14 18:44:00,1330,"I love my 7' Fig Rig. First time out it got slimed by 42""er on a 9"" sledge (MuskyBill color)  I think JB still carries them"
171487,silveradosheriff,2008-03-14 21:40:00,1025,"Yup - can't go wrong with 6'6"" - 7'. :-)"
171490,Want,2008-03-14 21:54:00,39,"Guess I'm cheap AND outdated. But I think the Jerkbait rod is the one that is most likely to be abused and sensitivity along with fine tuned actions, at least to me, haven't been key issues. So I like to keep them kind of ""inexpensive"".  I use an old Fenwick GLC Triggerstick: 5'9"" 1 -3 oz and an even older Daiwa Algonquin 6'6"" 1-6 oz.  Two fine pool sticks that have never failed me. I leave the bigger $ for crank and buctail rods. JMO"
171494,mattyk,2008-03-14 22:03:00,2110,"thanks for the recommendations guys! I think i may go with a 6' 6"" Premier as im a little shorter."
171542,muskymike,2008-03-14 23:32:00,772,You will be really happy if you go with the Premier. They are great rods and have been revamped 4 times since the intro to the Musky Series. They are not nearly as heavy and a lot more sensitive. They are not the broom sticks (which are still great) that they used to be.  I cant wait to get my hands on a rod tomorrow at the show. I think I have convinced myself to pick up 2 more and a Tokota as well.  There goes my money hahaha
