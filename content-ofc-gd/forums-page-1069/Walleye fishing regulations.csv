They've now apparently extended the sanctuary status of these two spots and the Gull Creek outlet area until JUNE 15th. Noticed this on a lot of other lakes as well where the sanctuary status ended at opener in the past and now is extended to June 15th.  All Zone 11 lakes now have a slot size of 16.9 to 23.6"" and some other lakes have their own different slot like Temagami's 18-23.6"" slot, French River PPark 15 to 25"""
