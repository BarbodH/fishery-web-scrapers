171425,Big Cliff,2008-03-14 18:02:00,6899,"Well, Simco would be a good choice, Cooks Bay, even if you don't have an auger there will be lots of holes drilled and you should be able to get some good perch and pike action."
171493,hi09,2008-03-14 21:59:00,46,yea buts thats for ice fishing right - i just want to do some shore fishing through the line in and SIT!! hopefully have some bites
171516,Big Cliff,2008-03-14 22:35:00,6899,"Well, you can sit while ice fishing but I don't think you are going to find too many places to fish from shore just yet unless you want to go for some rainbows. You could check out Bronte Creek, or some of the other places along the lake shore."

Don't know when the piers will, and surroundings will start getting busy. Like Cliff said, most of everything will be frozen... Cooks is a great option to sit throw your bait in and wait, by the way"
