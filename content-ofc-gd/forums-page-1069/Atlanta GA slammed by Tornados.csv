171697,Greencoachdog,2008-03-15 12:27:00,8163,"  Those storms rolled thru here in the wee hours of the morning Paul.... no damage that i can see. They did wake me up though, and we are liable to get some more before the day is over.  Duck and cover!!!"
171700,OhioFisherman,2008-03-15 12:33:00,6623,http://www.cnn.com/  Ya Glen they said more were possible and possibly the later ones could also hit Atlanta. Take care! Might not be a good day to be alone on the water.
171703,bucktail,2008-03-15 12:52:00,1857,Hey Glen   was just looking at the USGS website and they have a realtime stream flow map. Noticed it still says low to record low flows down there. Is the rains over the last few months helping or is the ground still sucking it up.   Darren
