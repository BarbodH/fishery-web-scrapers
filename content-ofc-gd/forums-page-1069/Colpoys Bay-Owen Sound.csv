171465,steve barrett,2008-03-14 20:19:00,142,Hi not sure if all the ice is out in owen sound . A couple of weeks ago a icebreaker came into owen sound to shake up the ice and begin the shipping season. There was a bit of ice around the ferry but I am not sure how far it goes out into the harbour. Best I can say call Owen Sound Marina  At  1 888 565  2628 they might help you. Steve
