171702,dow33,2008-03-15 12:39:00,27,I know the huts are to be off by march 15 but is the season closed!!
171717,Guest gbfisher,2008-03-15 13:18:00,0,TODAY!. No more targeting Lakers or Whitefish till MAY on Simcoe. It's all perch from here on in for ice fishing on Simcoe anyway.
171728,Beans,2008-03-15 13:51:00,3339,Add pickerel (walleye) to the list of closed species also as of 15 th March...Pike open till 31 st March...  Just leaves perch and crappie...note the daily limits on both...50 and 30 respectively
171749,irishfield,2008-03-15 15:04:00,26272,Want one more day for Lakers you'll have to head for Zone 11..at least they wrote that one with the weekend fisherperson in mind ! Whitefish are open all year in Zone 11 !
171784,bucktail,2008-03-15 17:41:00,1857,What is the point of closing the laker and whitefish on the 15th anyway. They both fall spawners. Is it just extra incentive to get the huts off? Always wondered the reason for this.
171797,Guest gbfisher,2008-03-15 18:08:00,0,Yes it is to keep the die hard from dieing harder............ Lakers are open in Zone 15 Wayne.   and whitefish as well. I may go tomorrow.....
171801,irishfield,2008-03-15 18:26:00,26272,I see it's open on the bay (14)  too... hmmmmm  Darren.. the one month Laker season on Simcoe & Zone 11 etc is pressure on the stock...so they say.
