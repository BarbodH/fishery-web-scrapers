170930,Headhunter,2008-03-13 16:43:00,5703,I think I'm addicted to poles! HH
170932,irishfield,2008-03-13 16:45:00,26272,Out of the Brass Rail and back to work Bud ...
170939,Headhunter,2008-03-13 17:01:00,5703,"Your right Wayne, the ballet is a very special place! HH"
171227,Mike the Pike,2008-03-14 02:48:00,3421,Yes very addictive for me . So much work not getting done around my house OFC did it to me.  What a great family I have met alot of great folks here I look forward to more years to come.  MTP
171311,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-14 12:25:00,2585,for me it depends on the day.  I work like 70hours a week so its nice to check in on here and see whats happening to get away form the stress of work.  I have a 2 year old son so most of the weekends are spent with him and the misses.  I tend to be on here way more in the summer reading the reports being envious of all you who get to fish 30x more then i do.  I have been a member here for 3 or 4 years now so i think it is very addicting.  Of all the sites i have signed up for over the years this one is the only one i have contiunued to be active in.  There are way worse things to be addicted to lol  Cheers!
171319,Cookslav,2008-03-14 12:33:00,1457,"Check it pretty much every day when I get home from work, and before bed, and sometimes before work, but I stay away while at work...Thought about it though LOL!  Prolly cut down once the nice weather is here though"
171369,walleyejigger,2008-03-14 15:36:00,876,"check it a couple times a day (but dont always log in) in the winter, summer i can go a week without, wonder why?  CABIN FEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  not able to at work (good thing) we only have a handfull of websites our IT dept. let's us peruse, mostly work related, I can only check the weather network so many times, CBC, local paper, rest is work related,"
171376,Reef Runner,2008-03-14 15:51:00,981,"Totally addicted.  I check it out at work, if I'm not too busy of course.  The chat feature cannot be accessed from my work terminal, for the better I suppose.  I can admit my problem, and I'm fine with that.  reefrunner"
171450,fishindevil,2008-03-14 19:16:00,6254,"This is too funny !!!!!...sorry i mean addictive.  ....can i buy a jumla,why do i need a jumla ??..LOL..LOL.   of course its addicting,it was meant to be that way.  ..im in for the long haul,man...wanna go fishin!!!!!"
171681,jonnybass,2008-03-15 11:38:00,346,"This place is really addictive. I bring my laptop into the bathroom with me when I take a dump just so I don't miss a post in real time! God bless wireless internet. I'm hooked!  </end sarcasm>  But seriously, the OP is bang-on. This site does have some addictive properties. I'm an OFNer!"
170513,snag,2008-03-12 21:04:00,1932, OFNA - The silent disease    Ontario Fishing Network Addiction     It's real and it's spreading. Just how bad is it? What can we do to stop it?  
170518,lew,2008-03-12 21:10:00,12767,"I couldn't tell you in minutes or hours per day SNAG, but I've been hanging around here for about 6 years or so, so ya, I guess you could say this place is addictive"
170519,tinbanger,2008-03-12 21:13:00,1028,comes and goes  can go for days without and othe times get the shakes if I havn't checked within the hour. dam OFC  tb
170520,snag,2008-03-12 21:13:00,1932, Couple years ago I remember thinking: Sure is nice to see Lew greeting everyone at 5am.  That's addictive!
170522,ccmtcanada,2008-03-12 21:16:00,7971,"Hmmm...I chose hours...only because of work though...it's just to handy to log in...LOL.  At home, I don't check nearly as often...that's why Monday to Friday I post the most...and barely at all on the weekends.  I see it more like checking to see how family is doing...mind you, I don't keep in touch with them as much as I log in here though.  I wonder if their phone numbers are up to date in my address book....  Think I need an intervention....is there a support group out there?? And don't say OFC Chat....LOL."
170524,douG,2008-03-12 21:18:00,2693,"Of course it's addictive.  I know that some workplaces block sites like this, but thank goodness the MotherCorp is not yet one of them.  I do appreciate that they don't allow the Java applet that would let me chat at work.  That would be a disaster."
170540,Rich Clemens,2008-03-12 21:47:00,3131,"I'm using checking things out every morning before work and again in the evenings.   I even tried to access the site from work.  With the way the network guys have things locked out ... I was really surprised it was able to get in.   I may peek a little a time or two a day ... but won't risk my job over it.  But Hey - If I get fired, that's just more time to be on the board ... right ?"
170572,danbouck,2008-03-12 22:39:00,4380,Hell I waive my boss over to show him some of the stuff on here!
170607,danbo,2008-03-12 23:52:00,2646,I can't afford drugs..so this is the next best thing!
170619,Rizzo,2008-03-13 00:28:00,4754,"Been around this site for about 5 years now.  Unfortunately, with lots of other commitments, only get a few minutes a day most times.  Almost always find something entertaining or moving to read though...keeps me coming back!  A real sense of family, especially after making it out to a couple of Lakairs, swills, and unfortunately, funerals."
170651,Greencoachdog,2008-03-13 01:10:00,8163,I don't think it's addictive at all and I can stop any time I want... I just don't feel like stopping right now...
170705,ChrisK,2008-03-13 02:09:00,2772,Defenetely some kind of addictive attraction going on here.....It was once said that TJ some how runs subliminal messages behind the main screen while you gaze into your monitor.....
170710,ccmtcanada,2008-03-13 02:13:00,7971," Come on...TJ isn't smart enough (buy Jumlas) for that is he?  I mean, after all (buy Jumlas), he's just a northern hick who (buy Jumlas) has nothing better to do with his time (buy Jumlas) than run a fishing network.  I for one (buy Jumlas) don't believe a word of that. He wouldn't insert messages (buy Jumlas) like that would he?  For some reason I feel the need to check out Avery's website to buy some Jumlas....."
170723,snag,2008-03-13 02:50:00,1932,"Mind meld!  I was going to drop $10,000 on Jumlas!"
170732,Radnine,2008-03-13 03:01:00,1538,"While my wife thinks I've lost it for spending so much time here, I think she's glad that she doesn't hear ""click, click, click, click,click, click,"" anymore every time she comes up stairs."
170765,highdrifter,2008-03-13 04:48:00,2534, HAHAH..  Hey they're having a sale on lucky craft baits apparently!  approx 12 dollars a bait.  that means you could stock up on top water sammies!  mmmmm sammies  OFC..  I need it..  I wanna make a phrunky concoction of it and stick it to my veins..!!  thanx budday HD
170768,Rich,2008-03-13 05:32:00,3927,"When asked by Sugarpacket if I'd ever take a desk job, my answer was:  ""Yeah, but I'd be fired within the first few hours for just sitting there on OFC all day"""
170782,OhioFisherman,2008-03-13 10:41:00,6623,"LOL I have a doctor`s excuse?  I can`t get out like I used too, it helps me keep what little sanity I have left?  Just nice to see people out there that still love and enjoy the sport!"
170840,Beans,2008-03-13 13:41:00,3339,"Being somewhat knowledgable of addictions (smoking, booze, fast women and slow horses) I have to say yes, OFC is an addiction...  It's not all bad though...I joined in the summer of 2002 and since have met a bunch of swell people...some at meet and greets, some on fishing trips, some at my home and some at theirs and a lot of others just on-line who I hope to meet face-to-face someday...  How much time do I spend here?...Probably too much...Does the Betty Ford Clinic have a program for OFC addiction ???"
170847,TJQ,2008-03-13 13:57:00,7806,"I resent that (buy jumlas)  anyone would insinuate (buy jumlas) that I would in any way (buy jumlas) use this fine forum (buy jumlas) to market any fishing product or services. http://www.averystackle.com  That would be unacceptable...   buy jumlas.... (Avery's on March break and is bored by now..)  .... and ,..... um.... minutes for me...."
170852,John,2008-03-13 14:03:00,2956,"Minutes for me too. I'm logged in most of the day M-F.............post when I have something semi intelligent to add, which is not too often."
170855,TJQ,2008-03-13 14:06:00,7806,  Why let that stop you... its doesn't stop anyone else!!!
170873,steve barrett,2008-03-13 14:25:00,142,"Mr Beans . Iam totaly in agreement with you on this addiction OFC  I have done it all also .Booze ,wild women  and such. But this site has become more important than my email.I have met a few guys through this site and belive though I havent met in person I can honestly say that they are a great bunch of fisherpeople (ladies included). I haven't gone the site to introduce myself yet as I cannot compose a introduction.I love watching old cronz on sundays and can remember old Red Fisher from the old days.All I can say for sure that I will follow this site an contribute now and then .Great site and hope it can go for many years .
