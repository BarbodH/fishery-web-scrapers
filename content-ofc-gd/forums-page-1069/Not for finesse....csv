171563,GbayGiant,2008-03-15 00:30:00,1780,"Ha, that things huge, probably stretches to 3-4 feet in the water, I'd say better for pike /musky. I have had a 16"" walleye eat a 10"" believer though, so you never know."
171583,Rizzo,2008-03-15 01:05:00,4754,"wow, that thing is revolting.  Is there any creature more disgusting than a leech?  Well, lamprey are pretty bad, and carp, oooo gross...now I'm gonna get me in trouble with our carp connoisseurs"
171627,Beans,2008-03-15 02:33:00,3339,You're ok Rizzo...Beauty is in the eye of the beholder...lots of fish prettier than carp and a hellofa lot uglier...
