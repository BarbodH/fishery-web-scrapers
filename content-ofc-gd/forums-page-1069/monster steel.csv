171517,silverstreak,2008-03-14 22:37:00,146,Hit this chunk of steel the other day on a Pink Riverworm.I have found that the small to mid size fish tend to fight better than the larger hogs. This steelie diden't make any long runs but rather just dogged it in the pool. Could hardly budge it though as it Felt like fighting a large cinder block. Peace.
