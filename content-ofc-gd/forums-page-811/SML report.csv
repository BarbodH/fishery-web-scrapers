I was fishin' last weekend on the mile and caught 2 baby lmbass. Had lots of blowups, I dedicated the day to topwater lures. This babybass was caught on a popper.  This was the first change I really got to know my rod , my new 8foot 6 inch pfluger (sp?) and pfluger President reel. I loved it! Casts real nice and the reel is as smooth as anything. I've herd someppl bashin' the president reel so ill let you know how It holds up. I'm pretty tough on my gear so ill let ya know when it poops in the diaper."
