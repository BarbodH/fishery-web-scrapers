366294,bigugli,2009-07-26 03:42:00,6138,"If you can wait another month, they often do an end of season clearance of basic combos $12-30.  That's usually when I pick up some kid's prizes I donate."

366303,Cudz,2009-07-26 05:17:00,2652,Don't chince out.  Buy that Cardinal 502 reel on sale this week and get that little fenwick on sale as well (or get a ligthning rod).  Under $100 and that is a solid setup for years.
366347,danbouck,2009-07-26 13:04:00,4380,If you have to go cheap at least go with good brands.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/Sp...ing%2BCombo.jsp  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/Sp...pin%2BCombo.jsp  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/Sp...mbo.jsp#reviews  Get whatever one suits your needs or just get the perdiest
366357,Bly,2009-07-26 13:58:00,1556,Would second Dan's suggestions if you are keeping the $40 limit.   The Total Tackle setup will assist you in catching fish and you mentioned that you are not a heavy fisherman but I can tell you that it will only take a few heavy fish before the Rod will begin to suffer.  Good luck with whatever you choose and look forward to hearing how it works out for you
366502,eze76,2009-07-26 21:39:00,70," Thanks ,  and thanks to everyone else to .   only reason i dont want to spend alot is cause im mostly shore fish well thats all i do XD , so thats why , when i get the rod ill post a reportt about my trip thanks everyone"
