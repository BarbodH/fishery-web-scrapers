365782,wolfville,2009-07-24 14:30:00,396,"MJL led the folks from Canada to win the first CamAm cup carp tournament, that's something to make a good resume. Also his writing is pretty enjoyable and he is very knowledgeable in carp fishing. He may not outfish me most of the time    but he got my vote."
365789,CLofchik,2009-07-24 14:44:00,854, I reject your reality and replace it with my own!
365851,bassjnkie,2009-07-24 19:07:00,1101," hehe, I got a vote, thanks Mike!. Unfortunately I have crappy writing skills. I still think MJL is the guy for the job."
365886,Crazyhook,2009-07-24 20:59:00,1154,Thanks for the votes guys! Some really good carp fishermen on this site. TJ you have a PM
365975,Rich,2009-07-25 03:01:00,3927, Ohh dude... I know you love carp.. but I didn't think you like... LOVED them!
366724,Beans,2009-07-27 13:23:00,3339,There is another very knowledgable carper that joined our board fairly recently...  Hairwig...(Mark) hasn't posted much so far but he is an all season carper including the winter...now that is dedication...
366735,ccmtcanada,2009-07-27 13:41:00,7971,How bout a collaborative effort?  MJL for writing and some of DSN's pictures?
366751,Roy,2009-07-27 14:45:00,13728,Go MJL Bubba. Package is leaving this afternoon.
366770,BillM,2009-07-27 15:26:00,17367," Great idea Cliff..  Let's everyone add a little bit to whatever TJ has planned, lol"
366798,bassjnkie,2009-07-27 16:41:00,1101,"Whoever is picked, I am more than willing to help out with this project free of charge. PM me if you need anything."
366801,TJQ,2009-07-27 16:46:00,7806,"Thansk for all the help guys, I think I have all my ducks in a row!!"
365529,TJQ,2009-07-23 18:15:00,7806,"I need some content on Carp Fishing - two things in particular.  I can tpay much, but I guarantee ya your content will be up with some pro's!!  Who is the most knowledgeable carp fisherman here???  Ya gotta be able to write a bit too!!"
365537,muskeybugged,2009-07-23 18:35:00,282,too badd i can knot right all that goood!  Beans....Victor>?
365549,Terry,2009-07-23 19:02:00,14456,dang I can't carp fish and I can't write real good...  so close to fame and fortune
365550,Joey,2009-07-23 19:07:00,9122,I think that would be Photoz or Beans maybe?  I can only catch them in the winter on perch bait and 2 lb test
365552,Handlebarz,2009-07-23 19:16:00,3790,Jamie (crazyhook) always has great pics I wonder if he fishes them from the Yak?
365555,danbouck,2009-07-23 19:33:00,4380,Me cetch carp lots. also i right arcticles.
365557,drwxr,2009-07-23 19:40:00,453,crazyhook or MJL. always enjoyed reading their reports.
365559,crappieperchhunter,2009-07-23 19:51:00,2582,MJL has did a tourney and seems to be up on all the gear/baits etc. I think he would be the obvious choice.
365560,irishfield,2009-07-23 19:53:00,26272,gbfisher likes to carp hunt !
365565,Terry,2009-07-23 20:11:00,14456,"LOL ""hunt""  you have a way with words  but he is good at getting carp"
365566,Photoz,2009-07-23 20:12:00,792,"I think MJL would have to get my vote . . .    he's knowledgeable on ALL aspects of carping, and CATCHES 'em when nobody else does."
365585,bassjnkie,2009-07-23 20:50:00,1101,I second MJL he has the knowledge and the writing skills.
365588,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-07-23 21:01:00,0,brook trout mebbe.  my carp articles would likely involve a bowfishing outfit and a case of beer.
365589,Victor,2009-07-23 21:03:00,1609,"definitely MJL, and he can write too.  But I also agree with the rest on Jamie (Crazyhook)"
365597,JohnF,2009-07-23 21:18:00,3494, Beer is never bad ....... unless it's Black Label and you have to share a tent with me.  JF
365608,misfish,2009-07-23 21:44:00,29133,I cant catch crap if I tried. SRY.
365610,Leecher,2009-07-23 22:01:00,7832,MJL gets my vote hands down!!! Leechman
365619,Beans,2009-07-23 22:48:00,3339,MJL and/or Photoz both have a way with words...Rodpody and/or Crappieperchhunter both outfish me most times...
365628,KelfuN,2009-07-23 23:14:00,246,MJL or Victor... but i only know those 2 who fish for carps
365630,farsider,2009-07-23 23:20:00,456,"I realize he dosen't post on here about Carp too much, but apparently Troutguy guides for Carp as well.  His Trout reports are decent."
365638,MJL,2009-07-23 23:56:00,2427,"I don't think I'm a 'Carp King'...I'm more of a carp violator  TJ, what did you have in mind?"
365663,JohnF,2009-07-24 00:52:00,3494, Now that's a disgusting image.  JF
365679,splashhopper,2009-07-24 01:53:00,2931, I second that
365689,mikeh,2009-07-24 02:13:00,824,"Danielm would get my vote, very knowledgible carp guy,  along with Photoz and MJL."
365694,CLofchik,2009-07-24 02:24:00,854,"Now I'm all for Hammercarp, or MJL, or any other carp guru writing a delightfully dry article recycling all sorts of lovely information that's already been said in lot's of other articles.......hair rigs, boilies & method mix oh my!  Or.....bear with me T.J......we go in another direction.  What the angling world needs is a Hunter Thompson-esque figure to shake up the establishment and make them think.  Make them think about carp!  The psychedelic Cronzy of carp if you will. Hey, I've already laid the groundwork, flesh out This Post, add a sidekick..........hey I even have a title!  Fight Of The Sausage Creature: Gonzo Carpin'  .......When I came to, the general back-alley ambience of the swim was so rotten, so incredibly foul. How long had I been lying there? All these signs of violence. What had happened? There was evidence in this spot of excessive consumption of almost every type of bait known to civilized anglers since 1544 AD. What kind of gear addict would need all these pods, buzzers & crushed sunflower seeds? Would the presence of fish account for all these crumbs of chicken feed? Would rockbass leave these puddles of still damp fish slime? Maybe so. But then why all this bait?  These were not the hoofprints of your average God-fearing angler gear junky. It was too savage. Too aggressive. Then like Moses parting the Red Sea the thought came to me in a flash......it was carp....only carp can lay down a shallow water smack down like this, no silly acrobatics on the surface like a smack addict doing the funky chicken.  Nope, just BOOM! instant take off on the hook set.  Some people will tell you that small is good - and it may be, on some days - but I am here to tell you brotha that big is better. And carp are big.  I've always believed this, in spite of the trouble it's caused me. Big strong fish will out pull small strong fish every day of the week. That is why God made carp, Bubba......   Heck there's even a tie-in to our straight to DVD movie effort:  Fear & Loathing In Lakair, Adventures In Sheepshead Country!"
