366362,Bly,2009-07-26 14:25:00,1556,"Tough question to give a simple answer to.....by best price do you mean the cheapest or the best price for the quality?  Berkley and Maxima make flouro leader and are usually less expensive.  Personally, did not care for the Berkley at all, have used the Maxima for a few things with better results but haven't tried it for rainbow/steelhead."
366368,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-26 14:36:00,947,yea for leader material you can't beat Seagar inviz-X and a Blood Knot.  The price is about 4-5 dollars more but will last you since it's leader material.   
366501,BillM,2009-07-26 21:38:00,17367,I switched from the Raven crap to 4lb Maxima flouro near the end of the steelhead season this year.   Don't plan on switching to anything else.  Combine that with 8lb mainline and you are all set.
