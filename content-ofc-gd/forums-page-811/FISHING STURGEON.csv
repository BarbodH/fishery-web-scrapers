365799,scottydog,2009-07-24 15:16:00,10,Would like to launch up near fenelon falls to fish lake sturgeon. Does anyone know where i could launch free or for pay. Any info  would be greatly appreciated. Will report when i get back
365818,Paully,2009-07-24 16:21:00,712,Most marinas have a launch.. good luck and let us know how you made out.
365843,Rizzo,2009-07-24 18:46:00,4754,"Can't remember where I launched when I went there. All I know is it wasn't hard to find a place, but I also didn't drive around looking for the free dirt ramp either, just went to to the first marina I found"
365868,fishnsled,2009-07-24 20:29:00,3520,Long Beach is about the closest to Fenelon Falls that I know of.
365887,Sinker,2009-07-24 21:03:00,8692,"Yeah, there aren't many launches up in that neck of the lake. I usually launch at pleasant point, or long beach and run up the lake.  s."
365937,DMASSE,2009-07-25 00:42:00,420,"there is a free launch in fenlon, right by the swing bridge...  Dave  ps  my cottage is right across the launch"
365969,ozaibak1,2009-07-25 02:51:00,401,"The owner at Long Beach would probably let you launch, I believe he may even be an OFC member. Rented a boat from him last weekend, a very nice and helpful person, I will be getting a boat from him again in less than 9 hours!!! Come on Walleye, big money big money big money!"
366004,Sinker,2009-07-25 04:42:00,8692," Thats in cameron though, not sturgeon.  You could lock thru......but why pay for the lock, when you can launch for free and run up the lake?  S."
366054,DMASSE,2009-07-25 13:26:00,420,sorry  all I saw was launch and fenlon falls....  there is a launch at whychwood as well on the river near the falls
366241,super dave,2009-07-26 00:38:00,323,you could just launch right in Sturgeon at verulum park.  Its free.  i think there is one on hickery road as well.  http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&ie=UT...077162&z=14
366245,jubaitca,2009-07-26 00:55:00,12,How much would it be to rent a boat from there?
366318,Sinker,2009-07-26 06:43:00,8692,"Its much closer from Pleasant point or Long beach if your driving from the south. Pleasant point is free. Gravel launch with no docks though. Long beach has a good launch, but you have to pay, and get a key, and return it.....I gave up on that one. Its only a 5 mile run from Pleasant point to the river to Fenelon.  I'm not sure you can launch at whychwood anymore either........can someone confirm this? Last time I went there, there was nobody home.........wasted a lot of my time.  S."
366532,michaelkovacs,2009-07-26 23:29:00,48,"Sorry, can't help you with your question.  BUT, I used to fish Sturgeon quite a bit, and I'll give you one good spot.  Find Sturgeon Point (opposite longbeach) and fish about 100 yards off the point bouncing jigs off the bottom.  We found that area to be very VERY reliable.  You will definitely see locals there in the evenings.  Best, Mike"
366676,scottydog,2009-07-27 09:59:00,10,Thanks for all the info everyone. I hope to try it this week and if I get out I'll let you know how it went.
