Just wondering if any board members have advice/tips on good lakes in the area or spots on Georgian Bay for fishing (any species)?  I do not have downriggers yet, just mounts for them (ignore downriggers in the photos).  Thanks!  "
366791,Rizzo,2009-07-27 16:18:00,4754,"so much water up there, maybe narrow it down a little! for starters you could try Manitouwabing or GBay for pike and pretty much anywhere for smallmouth. Everywhere I've fished up there has had great smallie fishing"
366828,bluesky1713,2009-07-27 17:31:00,107,"Ok.  Hmmm... I'd like to keep it close, if at possible.  That way I could load up and hit the lake after work.  And, it would be nice to be able to target some pickerel.  Is Manitouwabing a good fishery overall?  Also, if I were to get some downriggers, is it possible to catch salmon, lakers, or bows on GB off Parry Sound?"
366851,TC1OZ,2009-07-27 18:09:00,987,"Head out into the Towhship of The Archipelago, millions of random spots in calm little bays around all the islands.  Best fishing I've ever done....but I don't get out much!  Tons of fish to be caught! All different types!"
366859,JFish,2009-07-27 18:53:00,29,"I have fished Manitouwabing a number of times, usually just for the small tourney they have in the fall.   Decent sized lake and I'm still trying to figure it out.  I wanted to explore new water there a couple times and couldn't catch anything.  I really couldn't believe the areas I was fishing didn't produce any fish.  I find it to be a tough place to fish if you don't know the area too well.  I know some guys do well there.  If anybody has any tips for fishing I'm sure it would help us out.  JFish"
366877,izaakwalton,2009-07-27 20:01:00,27,"I just came back from a weekend on Manitouwabing.  I fished for 4 hours on Saturday and Sunday and got into 6 pike total.  The biggest could still be called a hammerhandle.  I agree with JFish's statement that the lake is tough to figure out.  I fished islands, points, shallow weedbeds, docks, shorelines with sunken timber - all the classic spots that are supposed to yield fish and caught nothing.  If you choose Manitouwabing, I'd advise you to fish with someone who knows the water well - it's a tough nut to crack.  The boat traffic is fairly light on the lake but that could have been due to the poor weather."
