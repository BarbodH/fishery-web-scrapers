366870,Kinger,2009-07-27 19:50:00,351,"I'm from Sault ste marie as well.  The best place I know for whitefish is off the western pier on whitefish island. Teardrops, teardrops tipped with waxworm and small rapala minnow jigs in white/green have brought me success during the summer. I've never caught a steelhead on purpose so I can't really help you there. Tight lines."
