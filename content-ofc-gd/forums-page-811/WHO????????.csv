366703,Greencoachdog,2009-07-27 12:17:00,8163,  Does this mean y'all are going to have a cold winter Pete?
366837,Rattletrap2,2009-07-27 17:46:00,1652,"Brian, I think there might be the lyrics to a good song in there somewhere?  Long as I remember The rain been comin' down. Clouds of myst'ry pourin' Confusion on the ground. Good men through the ages, Tryin' to find the sun; And I wonder, Still I wonder, Who'll stop the rain. I went down Virginia, Seekin' shelter from the storm. Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow. Five year plans and new deals, Wrapped in golden chains. And I wonder, Still I wonder Who'll stop the rain. Heard the singers playin', How we cheered for more. The crowd had rushed together, Tryin' to keep warm. Still the rain kept pourin', Fallin' on my ears. And I wonder, Still I wonder Who'll stop the rain.  Good ole' classic CCR!"
366848,bigugli,2009-07-27 18:02:00,6138,Just remember what this could have been. Every inch of rain produces 8-10 inches of snow.  Be very thankful.
366853,stasbrute,2009-07-27 18:16:00,206,All this rain is fine for fishing but why did it have to end up in my basement yesterday?!?!?!!!!
365962,misfish,2009-07-25 02:31:00,29133,Who will stop the rain?  Every friggen weekend.
365967,ozaibak1,2009-07-25 02:47:00,401,"It's funny, 90% of the time it either rains, or is fore-casted to rain and doesn't. I've been through so many hours in the rain that I really don't mind it anymore, I in fact prefer it to a sunny day while fishing. I also don't use umbrellas anymore, the rain falling on me reminds me of fishing"
366015,snag,2009-07-25 06:18:00,1932,"Brotha,  Ain't nuthin' but a thang."
366023,Lunker777,2009-07-25 11:02:00,866,My grandpa was telling me years back when they had a summer and it rained something like 14 weekends in a row ! EVERY WEEKEND of the summer..... that would SUCK !  Althought the fishing would be good !
366026,pikehunter,2009-07-25 11:21:00,1659,"Summer of 1990 every weekend it rained and I had a job with every weekend off. This was my son's first year and we still had our motorhome. We didn't use it once all summer and sold it in September. What a kick in the ass that was, as you can see I haven't forgotten it after all these years.  We must be setting a record this season with the unreal amount of rainfall and temperatures. I went out to the garage yesterday morning to pull the boat out to go fishing. The sky was dark and cloudy looking over the mountain and towards where I wanted to go. I contemplated it for an hour and the cloud mass got closer. I decided not to go out. Then it got cooler and in the afternoon it got really hot so I came home and put the A/C on. At 4:00 I went to pick my wife up and it was cold again, and cloudy. Decided to start up the BBQ, everytime I went to pull it out of the garage it started to rain. Put it back and the sun came   out, decide to do it again and the rain started. Put it away and the sun came out! Off and on it went like this for half an   hour.In the end the sun won the battle but now I find out the steak I had just bought in the same afternoon was   bad, back to the store it goes and frozen hamburgers came out of the freezer!  I too have joined the club of the disenchanted and want the local weatherman's resignation    The weather network is no better, at least 3 times this year they were totally off as to wind direction. The last time we went out on the water they said we were to have a NW wind...it was E, N/E, on Lake Erie that can make a big difference."
366036,Pike_Nut71,2009-07-25 12:19:00,18,Perhaps we should band together and ask all them weather folks to resign....
366038,Terry,2009-07-25 12:26:00,14456,"I remember it as, summer 1992, 16 weekends in a row..wet nasty........."
366042,Greencoachdog,2009-07-25 12:35:00,8163,Uh... isn't that what they make raingear for???... It also makes the trees grow big and tall... and the Skeeters big and Fat!!!  If y'all were having a drought with blistering temperatures... you'd squawk aboot that too!!!
366046,spinnerbaitking,2009-07-25 12:56:00,1622,"Not that I want it to rain every weekend but you don't have to worry about the skier,tubers or jet ski's when it's raining & I work every other weekend normally so as long as it's raining that weekend I don't really care HAHA, so I'm trying to decide do I go fishing today or tomorrow, waiting for a buddy to phone to decide Tight Lines Richard"
366050,Rizzo,2009-07-25 13:16:00,4754,ya I remember that summer back in the early 90's. It almost funny had bad it was every week-end.
366055,xkempx,2009-07-25 13:27:00,84,I like fishing in the rain. Not more the 10mm of rain. then its a soaker
366067,Sinker,2009-07-25 14:01:00,8692,"If I let the weather decide my fishing trips, I'd never get out. Just slap on the slicker and head out......its just water!  S."
366170,Rich,2009-07-25 19:58:00,3927,If the fish don't mind getting wet neither do I!
366183,misfish,2009-07-25 20:42:00,29133,"Myself ,I have fished in down pours.It,s part of the game,we all know that. But now the weekends are for cruising with the mrs,s. Nice days would be nice for her.  Wish I lived in Bama,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NOT.LOL"
366186,Billy Bob,2009-07-25 21:00:00,5865,I am remember it was '93 or maybe '92 as Terry has mentioned that it rained everyday that summer but 11 days.....
366207,bigugli,2009-07-25 22:18:00,6138,There was also the summer of 82. Rain rolled in Friday night and stayed til Sunday evening. There  has to be good and bad years.  This year the rain almost always coincides with my market days at St Jakobs. Brutal again today.
366211,Jonny,2009-07-25 22:35:00,1380," NOPE.  The memory of winter is always fresh in the mind up here.  ---  Couldn't be more miserable here today if it tried... wind kicking up rollers crashing in from the East, raining like a son of a gun (relieved by periods of absolute downpour), 16 degrees C.  Well yeah, it could be colder.  My days of fishing in the rain (and snow) are over. Been there, done that many times. I ain't that macho any more."
366214,camillj,2009-07-25 22:43:00,1988, Didnt seem to bother the Blue Jays that year
366215,Greencoachdog,2009-07-25 22:43:00,8163,"  You would DIE in the summer down here!!!  Someone would be picking you up out of the boat carpet with the Shop-Vac!!!... ""My Canadian MELTED""!!!"
366220,misfish,2009-07-25 22:59:00,29133,  LMAO Glenn.  Bring the heat.
366229,TJQ,2009-07-25 23:50:00,7806,"My Canadian Melted... LOL...    Hey, I think everyone should have one!!!"
366230,HTHM,2009-07-26 00:01:00,4082,Well MY Canadian was drunk by my future son in law.....
366349,Billy Bob,2009-07-26 13:15:00,5865, I don't think so because up here we have a quick fix for the heat.............it's called Labatt's Ice.  Look but don't touch...... http://www.labatt.com/english/lbc_brands/fam/fb_ice.html
366417,Squid,2009-07-26 17:21:00,1656,Has there even been a day over 30C in Southern Ontario this Summer? I do recall a couple in June??
366423,misfish,2009-07-26 18:11:00,29133,"yeah 2. With the long winter we had,those temps would be nice right now.Wait,has winter finished yet? LOL"
