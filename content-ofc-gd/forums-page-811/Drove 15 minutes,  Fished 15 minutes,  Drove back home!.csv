366449,splashhopper,2009-07-26 19:27:00,2931,"Mrs Splashhopper asked me if I wanted anything from the mall today.. Not even sure if I heard the rest of the conversation  after she said ""mall""   .  All I ""heard"" was...honey... I am going to the mall.. you may as well go fishing  So I drove 15 minutes, fished 15 minutes, drove back home  It was ""almost"" the best 15 minutes of my life !  I arrived to find this >   and this >>   Hmmm.... That's a LOT of mud from last nights rain... So I walk about 200 yards and find this (note the sunshine and the pond scum)>>     PERFECT !  I set up my rod and throw the ""scum frog"" in to THE SCUM   and wait ""5 steamboats"" and then give it a little twitch..  WHAMMO..  and a miss  give a few more ""steamboats"" and another little twitch to see if its still there...  WHAMMO.. .AND ANOTHER MISS  geeeshhh... now i am getting a little worried..  A couple of ""steam boats"" later and WHAM... the rod damned near came out of my hand  I SET THE HOOK hard !  and bring my PB Large-mouth Bass in >>>   and here is its bucket >>    The picture doesn't do it justice at all... it was 18"" and thick thick thick. Nobody on the trail at that moment to take a pic for me... I hurried up and got it back in the water to live another day.  So, I decide to try the ""Scum Frog"" on the SCUM again... see if it's lives up to its name again  Sure enough..... first cast and KAPOW !  fISH ON and I bring this little one in (average for this place)  ( this time a hiker was passing by and snapped a quick pic for me)  The sad thing about that last one was that the lure was so far down its throat I couldn't get the hook out. I bled it out and brought it home for my neighbor just to get the ""SCUM FROG"" back.  Just as I get ready for my third cast.... CRACK.. BANG... BOOM... CRASH  and holy crap.... a cloud burst right above me...   I was soaked in a matter of seconds....  That was the end of a ""perfect guilt free Sunday of fishing"" for me.... LMAO..  Can i say it any louder folks..... I am HOOKED on Top-WATER fishing in the sloppiest crap I can find  !!  Splashhopper"
366457,bow slayer,2009-07-26 19:48:00,1074,hey splashhopper is that the ponds in the Pond Mills area? I grew up there and use to fish them often.I have not fished them in about 10 years. I also was a member of the fishing club off southdale and was thinking about re-joiniing. Those ponds are full of bass.
366458,grinandbearit30,2009-07-26 19:48:00,50,"Way to go!  I spent 2 hours on my Scum Frog today, with nearly the exact same conditions..and didn't see a minnow."
366459,splashhopper,2009-07-26 19:54:00,2931,  hmmmmm...  I would have to kill ya if I told ya... on the INTERNET !
366465,misfish,2009-07-26 20:06:00,29133,That cracking and booming and down pour has arrived here now.  Top water action is awesome.Good to hear yer enjoying it.
366471,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-26 20:11:00,3761,"Great job, I have had times like that where the fish had hit 2 or 3 times in the slop gets ur heart pumping.   Thanks and congrads, MTBF"
366481,Leecher,2009-07-26 20:46:00,7832,Got to love the short action on that report!!!  A real beauty    congratulations and thanks for sharing Leechman
366484,JohnF,2009-07-26 20:54:00,3494, Is it better than a 10# sucker or carp going into action at yer feet as you wade a treacherous bit of rapids? My aged heart struggles with those d----d things. Heaven only knows how much more ferocious they'd be if they had my hook stuck in 'em.  JF

366654,Cudz,2009-07-27 03:38:00,2652,"that 18"" is a nice clean looking bass!"
366836,Rattletrap2,2009-07-27 17:39:00,1652,"Beautiful fish there Splashhopper!  Better yet, with a layer of scum like that, it's hard to tell what lays beneath those weeds!"
