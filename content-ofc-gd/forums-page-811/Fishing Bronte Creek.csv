Still, it was good being out there all day.  After looking at Bronte Creek on Google Maps I can see it goes pretty far north. Does anyone know any good spots on Bronte Creek north of Dundas? I'm thinking about trying it out this weekend."
366977,Marko,2009-07-28 01:44:00,854,I am going to take a wild guess and say there are some bass up there but i know for sure that salmon make it that far in the fall and most likely rainbow trout do as well. Creek itself is fairly shallow so i would suggest fishing deeper holes.
