366329,splashhopper,2009-07-26 12:02:00,2931,nice smallie...  the young guy musta had fun with those pike.  We were fishing a short ways from you and missed the rain and the lightning... could here it in the distance though... got caught in it real bad on the way home... had to slow down to 30 k on the highway with the 4-way's on.
