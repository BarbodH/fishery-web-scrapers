366371,evster,2009-07-26 14:41:00,367,"My wife and I want to go fishing for a couple days next weekend somewhere...not sure where though...  Most likely we will be fishing Monday and Tuesday (driving up Monday morning).  So I was thinking of trying to find a place to stay sort of central to the Kawarthas and pick which lakes we will fished based on wind etc.  I know the Monday it will be a zoo anywhere, but the tuesday should be nice.  Anyway, has anyone ever stayed in Bobcaygeon or anywhere in the area for that matter and can recommend a place?  Also, if you have any other ideas for a 2 day fishing trip i'm open.  Don't want to go too far though.  Thanks! Evan"

It is just on Front Street in Bobcaygeon, right next to the marina. You are going to have difficulties finding a place for such a small amount of time (anywhere) but I suppose if someone had an opening, especially last minute, they would rather have a couple days rent money rather than none. Good luck! Jim http://www.watersedgecottages.ca/webdev/"
