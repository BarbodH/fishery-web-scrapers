365910,Fishnwire,2009-07-24 22:41:00,983,"I had a simular day of fishing last Monday.  By the end of the day, my left thumb looked like sandpaper from lip-locking so many big bass.  There's nothing like catching one ofter another of the size of fish that might make a guy's whole year.  Another good thing is when the big ones are in feeding frenzy mode, you can go all day and not hook into anything less than 16 inches...the littles ones lay low or end up as food I guess.  I'm going back to that very spot tomorrow for five days straight.  It's all about the soft plastic and top waters, baby.  I can't wait.  Thanks for sharing the vid.  Good stuff."

We weren’t disappointed! 11 trophies, two nearing 20” and a bunch of these odd goldfish thrown in the mix; biting on senkos of all things…          Twin 18's hit the net at the same time!    The one that made my day!    The other one nearing 20    The quest for the 20 inch smallmouth continues....  Oh yea, and those odd goldfish eating bass baits...    "
