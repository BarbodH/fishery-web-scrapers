366008,timmeh,2009-07-25 04:52:00,609,lots of spots around there. Pick one and give it a go. Try some different lures and find out whats working.

Lots of little river smallies to be caught in that area and though I've never done well there are some walleye to be caught. If you want pike you'll have to do some searching but there are some pike spots close by."
