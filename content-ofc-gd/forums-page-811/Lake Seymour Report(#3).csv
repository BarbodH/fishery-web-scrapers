I caught some fish this weekend and had a good time, Doug had a good time also and caught some nice little panfish. I got him using a crankbait and a jerkbait for the first time(X-Rap slashbait and a X-Rap shad shallow) and he had a good time using them, I myself used them and caught some small fish and a decent 1 1/2lb bass from under a boat just running the crank along side it-   Here are some more pictures, as always got up early and threw the poper around catching fish(and loosing fish), and I got a video of a strike+the fight on a decent bass!!!I was very happy lol  Enjoy,  The 2 fish on film    Small bass caught on a spinner[b/]           And as always some type of animal comes out to visit me, this time a otter or a beaver maybe-  Thanks for viewing, MTBF"

366533,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-26 23:34:00,3761,"Thanks for the compliments guys, never thought of being shaken or a little nervous on video lol. As said, guess it's natural.  On my trip to Kingston next week(leaving Saturday for 2 weeks) I'll take many short videos and try my best to get some strikes filmed...Then make a 10 minute or so long video for you all if wanted.  Tightlines, MTBF"

366558,danbouck,2009-07-27 00:26:00,4380,  That would be great but we don't want one of those shows that just talk about how the fish aren't biting. We need ACTION!!!
