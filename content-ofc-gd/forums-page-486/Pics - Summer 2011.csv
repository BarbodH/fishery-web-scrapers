624098,laszlo,2011-09-23 07:15:00,487,Hello everyone.  It's been a while. This summer consisted of less fishing for me being that my wife Anna and I moved in August into our first house. The maddness has since deflated and I'm prime and ready for some great fall fishing.  Summer Pics...  The joys of being a dad       Fish...         My Vessel...       BRING ON FALL!!! My favorite season.  Laszlo
624132,rufus,2011-09-23 13:00:00,267,Some great fish pics - even a flying baby! Gotta like it
624137,Joey,2011-09-23 13:14:00,9122,Love the first pic  Looks like you did not too bad being as busy with the house move and kid as you were
624189,registerfly,2011-09-23 15:15:00,198,Nice to see someone else using pontoons. I've got a 12ft Dave Scadden fitted for 2 and it absolutely was the best investment I made for fishing outside of fishing with my 13 yr old.  BTW I still remember when my guy was the same age as yours and I would chuck him up as high as yours. Mine just made the scared look everytime I did it. Now he picks me up. enjoy this time.
