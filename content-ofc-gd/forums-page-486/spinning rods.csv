623306,northernpike56,2011-09-21 02:14:00,717,"My rod broke tonight while fishing for some salmon. I have an abu garcia cardinal C102i spooled up with 6 lb triline that I would like to pair with my new rod because thats what I had been using with my rod that broke. what are some other rod options I should be considering? I would like something smaller because I just use the spinning setup for smaller fish (trout, panfish, walleye, bass, etc.), but I pretty much throw anything with the rod so I would like a bit of backbone to it as well.  Matt."
623312,Skipper D,2011-09-21 02:27:00,1970,"got a 6'6 the other night at canadian tire , 0n sale 69.99  its an autographed Bob Asumi Pro Series by Shimano , i sure like after useing it all day last saturday , very light weight in the hand , lets you feel every thing below"
623326,chefboi17,2011-09-21 02:55:00,128,"I have 3 specialists that I got from crappy tire, I think they were 40$ with the reel on sale. For the price, these feel great, and I don't mind lending them out to newbies"
623330,Skipper D,2011-09-21 03:16:00,1970," Matt ihad the same Aba C  rod as you and broke it too , i sure like it and it was my number one , this new one i told you about is just like the Aba and maybe better .. bought several since the Aba broke and they were'nt the same , this Samano dose the trick realy well......."
623334,northernpike56,2011-09-21 03:25:00,717,"  thanks for the input, I will be checking that out tomorrow after school at the tackle store, its right in my price range as well!!"
623373,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-21 11:49:00,1022,For sensitivity I like the Fenwick Canadian Methods rod. Its red in colour and is about 60-70$ at Bass Pro if I remember correctly. I reach for it before I reach for my shimano compre when I am jigging. It is way more sensitive than the double the price compre. I guess you pay for the lifetime warranty the compre offers. For me its been well worth it since I have already had 2 replaced on warranty.
623382,miller,2011-09-21 12:01:00,223,i have a specialist combo too and love it. the sensitivity for jigging helped me alot this year on my few trips out for walleye. i know my local canadian tire sells the combo but its red unlike my older one.
623383,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-21 12:13:00,2690," I used to be a fan of Fenwick rods, too.  Started reading posts about breakage issues.  Sure enough on our northern trip this year, while motoring back to the dock...my Fenwick baitcaster rod (with very little strain on the tip) popped!!! The Shimano rod Skipper D mentioned goes on sale for $39.99 quite a few times a year...not a bad piece of equipment for the price.  The Berkley Lightning Rods aren't too bad for a cheaper rod as well.  I still have the 7 fter that I got for my 18th B-day...28 years ago, yikes!!!!"
623411,manjo39,2011-09-21 13:30:00,354,"  My favourite rod is the BPS Carbonlite.  I jig, spinner and crankbait with it.  It is everything you describe you want - very sensitive, good backbone and its extremely light.  If you wait for it to go on sale it will be in the upper end of your range."
623426,GBW,2011-09-21 14:09:00,8460,best bang for your buck is the Shimano Voltaeus.  they go on sale from time to time too.
623430,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-21 14:19:00,2690," What about the sensitivity factor on the Voltaeus?  From what I've heard (don't own one, so I can't really comment) they are pretty ""whippy"".  The Shimano signature series, has decent sensitivity for a $40-$70 rod."
623439,GBW,2011-09-21 14:29:00,8460,I use one all the time and I can feel a fish fart 2' from the lure.
623440,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-21 14:30:00,2690, You sure that's the fish
623459,GBW,2011-09-21 15:02:00,8460,"Oh yeah Adam, that's a good one too.  and yes Frank, it's the fish..."
624076,northernpike56,2011-09-23 02:28:00,717,Thanks
624112,Fish4Eyes,2011-09-23 11:44:00,1022," I have owned mine for about 5 years and it has been good. I have really put it through its paces when snagged using 10lb Power Pro. Sometimes I wondered myself how I didn't break it  . Thanks for the heads up though, I will keep it in mind for future purchases."
624541,Moosebunk,2011-09-24 17:52:00,3970,"The Fenwick walleye class rods I always loved for their action, but after two easy breakages wouldn't re-buy.  I was under the impression that Berkely made them, and if true it's surprising.  I've had a Gary Roach light action 5 1/2 Berk Lightning for a long time, don't use it much now but I've put it through the paces, and it is still one of the best sticks I've ever owned."
624579,adolson,2011-09-24 20:17:00,783,"I love my Voltaeus.. It was a whole lot cheaper than the rods that I was considering, and it was an impulse purchase. It just felt right in the store... Thinking of getting one as a gift for someone I know this Christmas.  I previously used an Ugly Stik and what a difference... I can't go back to that heavy noodle now. It's now my guest fishing partner rod. Poor suckers!"
624604,adempsey,2011-09-24 22:21:00,1498,You might be able to find a Shimano Compre or Clarus on clearance within that price range.  Those rods were on clearance in most stores because the new models are coming out.
