I agreed and had a great time observing 3 new hunters on their first goose hunt. The mentoring program is a great method to introduce young hunters to our wonderful livelihood of hunting. I enjoyed calling in the geese for these youngsters as they opened up on the geese that were fooled by our calls. We were successful in taking 2 limits which were more than enough birds for 3 families and let the rest live for another days hunting in a couple of weeks.  Youngsters are relaxing while the grownups are setting up decoys.    Early sunrise    My trainee in the next layout blind    Greg (Dad) with proud daughter retrieving goose.   The whole crew with 10 birds and yours truly behind the camera.   Best regards, Sam"
