624195,blaque,2011-09-23 15:39:00,2419," Thats an ironic quote lol.......My boss just told me this week that one of our customers was ""too busy pickin up pennies off the ground to see the dollar bills blowing away"""
624199,Bondar,2011-09-23 15:46:00,817,Surprise people are missing the point on this and get off track again !!!  This is about the classified ads not getting chrome trim thrown in on your new truck or bickering at a big box store for a seniors discount ! This is a one on one transaction with a guy selling quality gear at less than half price ! Which usually works out great for both seller and buyer and I'm pretty sure when a price is FIRM the person doesn't. NEED to sell it and isn't starving so low balling is kind of pointless
624200,Billy Bob,2011-09-23 15:50:00,5865, Now there you go again.....taking all the fun out of this...
624225,fishing,2011-09-23 16:47:00,167,"If I want to sell something for $350, I will say $370. The fact is nobody wants to pay firm price for used goods anymore. Just bought a car, $5000 firm, paid $4500 plus free brakes, warranty and much more. Like prescription glasses, my friend always gets them at the price of 3 pairs for $100."
624228,mercman,2011-09-23 17:11:00,7054," We aint talkin Senior Citizen discount here Bob I could get Golden Ager pricing too, but i refuse to say i'm OLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

624234,davis,2011-09-23 17:19:00,128,"So this surprised you that someone would try to negotiate a lower price (low-balling aside)? I've made many purchases where I've ended up paying less than the so-called 'firm' price. Whether you indicate 'firm' or keep the price up to leave room for negotiation, people will always try to bargain. Part of the game..."

624319,misfish,2011-09-23 20:28:00,29133,"Taken a turn here thats going south pretty fast.  Mike before it does,I would like to say one thing.  Like said here,asking price (firm or what ever),compare to new and yes ,it,s used,BUT,and this is the most important BUT. If you know the seller and knows his/hers reputation and the quality of fishing they do and know thier stuff is kept and are honest,there should be NO issue. I have bought many things here. I have asked for a lower price,but never lowball. 20-30 bucks less(depending the asking price and model and year),to me is the norm. I had one deal fall through cause he wouldnt drop 25 bucks on two items.Wished him well.  I would like to have that used jacket Mikes has,never replied as he is not close enough for me to try it on to make sure it fits. (Nice jacket and price Mike BTW)  Sellers know whats it worth,well some.The buyer knows aswell."
624336,davis,2011-09-23 21:23:00,128," well then i guess i misunderstood, probably from not knowing what you are selling and what you're asking for (i haven't read all the responses in between) i took from your post that you were just pissed that people would offer you less because you indicated prices are firm, and my point was that it's expected to be offered less, firm or not. i found a trailer on kijiji listed for $800 firm. Went to see it, and ended up towing it home for $700. some may consider that a lowball, some may not - either way i saved myself $100. just my $0.02. no harm meant..."
624338,misfish,2011-09-23 21:31:00,29133," May I add to davis reply(no disrepect),you got a nice deal from me,and you did not low ball me. It was a mutual deal."
624358,Billy Bob,2011-09-23 22:29:00,5865,"If the lonepaddler had a good deal advertised in the classified, then this thread wouldn't be here...or maybe it's just the wrong time of the year for such items....either way.....GOOD LUCK.  BOb"
624364,misfish,2011-09-23 22:40:00,29133," Acually it,s the best time to sell Bob. Prime time. Many will sell on the off season. Lower bang for your buck then."
624365,Billy Bob,2011-09-23 22:42:00,5865," Wouldn't that be a ""bigger"" bang for your buck..."
624366,solopaddler,2011-09-23 22:43:00,8605," Another uninformed opinion from Billy Boob.  For what it's worth my stuff was all priced at a MINIMUM of 50% off, some items a lot more than that, and are either brand new or in as new condition.  You think that's not good enough to post a firm price on an internet board where I'm fairly well known?  If I had wanted to post something on Kijiji at a higher price and ask for best offer I would have.  My intentions here were twofold: sell my stuff quickly and give a fellow board member a deal.  It was frustrating last night when I was snowed under by low offers.  In any case half the stuff has now sold since yesterday for my more than fair asking price."
624369,misfish,2011-09-23 22:53:00,29133,"  NO Selling stuff off season,makes you seem desperate.Selling when it,s prime,make your sale is even."

623912,solopaddler,2011-09-22 17:42:00,8605," I agree on all counts except changing the board format.      If that was my plan it hasn't worked. I havn't had a single pm since I made this post LOL!

623919,jedimaster,2011-09-22 18:01:00,3472,"I too like the idea of an off topic forum. I think it would be nice to have a fishing, hunting and off topic forum. And then similar to how big fat bass has theres, setup the main page as a Recent threads page, so you can quickly scan whats new across all forums.  As for the topic at hand here. Even if you say firm no offers and someone offers you something else, it may be an indicator that the value you are placing on it is less than the value potential buyers are placing on it. I will rarely place something firm, unless I actually just want to keep it. I presume people will make an offer. I have had people agree to a price on email, and phone and show up with less money. I usually take it anyway, cause if its to the point I don't want it, I just actually want to get rid of it. If its something I am stuck on a price, I just ignore the offers, but I don't get offended by it.  To each there own."
623921,Lip-ripper,2011-09-22 18:12:00,228,"I was selling an old dirtbike on Kijiji and kept getting emails from some kid offering me less than 30% of what I was asking. He then got nasty saying I was an idiot, and that I was asking way too much etc.  I'd imagine he has a new email address by now because after I was finished signing him up for every junk mail website I could find on the net, he'd probably still be unsubscribing from them if he didn't change it by now. Serves the little punk right."

I hate it when i get someone coming in and trying to get parts tax free, or haggling.If they say they can get it cheaper elsewhere, i send them elsewhere. if i am in the market for something in the classifieds, i check the NEW price, then if the price in the classified is still too high, that means i dont have enough money to buy it yet, and will wait till i do. Thats me. The wife,however, will negociate till you scream."

624165,mercman,2011-09-23 14:16:00,7054,"  Absolutely But every scenario is different.I wouldnt go into WallyWorld and get to the cash and bargain with the cashier though.Or haggle with the clerk at the grocery store over the price of Bush Beans In the classifieds on this site, to me anyways,its like buying from a friend.I would never insult a friend by trying to low ball him.As far as i am concerned, its cheaper than a store, and you dont have to pay tax."
624168,jedimaster,2011-09-23 14:28:00,3472,"  Its also used, and you have no idea what was done with it, as well you can't return it and likely it doesn't have a warranty, so your taking your chances. The value I place on your used goods, may be different than the price you place on your goods. If you have it for sale long enough, perhaps you may change your mind and take an offer lower than what your asking. I am half tempted to see what he is selling now just so I can make a determination as to weather or not I would grace him with an offer.  haha"

624176,crappieperchhunter,2011-09-23 14:43:00,2582,  I have a buddy at work. 3 teenagers and one income. He barters for everything! He has got discounts from every box store you can imagine....so yes it happens.
624178,jedimaster,2011-09-23 14:43:00,3472,"Also. I talked to a guy about a new rifle for the deer season, These were brand new. He had a clearance sale, and firm prices on his site. After some back and fourth I ended up buy two new guns, (TC Impact Muzzle loader and a Weatherby Vanguard Sub MOA) for an awesome deal at below his final firm price, with the understanding that I wouldn't tell anyone what price I got them for.  I can hardly wait to sight these in. He at first said no to my offer, but then we went back and fourth a bit and ended up buying 2 instead of one. He was happy, I was happy, deal done. If he had of told me to piss off with my offer from the begining than I would have bought from someone else.... Just sayin....To each there own. Just not usually a good idea to piss off even a low baller, they may just be pking for your actual low price. I listed a boat for sale on here with a firm price. I got several lower offers, and to each one, I negotiated back, ok, but I am taking this off or that off the boat etc... In the end I still have the boat and am happy it hasn't sold.  SO if you wanna keep your goods, a firm price is the best way to do that."
624181,Billy Bob,2011-09-23 14:49:00,5865," NO NO NO and NO.....they had a model on sale I didn't want and asked if I could get some money off on a different manufactured gun safe....manager said he would check on what the store paid...came back a few minutes later and said if I purchased it today he would take off $75....done deal I said and he didn't lose a sale...smart manager because I wasn't really that interested until then and could of waited or went somewhere else....the buyer holds most of the cards, especially these days...  When I purchased my chocolate lab from Pittsburgh, PA I made the offer if and ONLY IF the breeder would meet me more then half way to my liking...  I have always taught my sons....""what do you have more of, money or time"" then make your decision when you're going to purchase or do something that involves green backs.....my mother always taught me to watch my pennies and the dollars will take care of themselves...good advice even today.

623732,scugpg,2011-09-22 10:30:00,1373, I share the same concept. The majority of firm price ads I see are usually overpriced (in this case I highly doubt it) I always do my research before putting in an offer. I've been low balled several times and it can be insulting.

623734,solopaddler,2011-09-22 10:41:00,8605, Yeah trust me the things I'm selling aren't even close to being overpriced.  People aren't lowballing me though. They're offering me 10 or 20 bucks less then balk when I stand firm.  It just boggles my mind that people would quibble over such a small amount of money LOL!

623744,Roy,2011-09-22 11:36:00,13728," There's more attitude than luck involved, Lew. Some people approach buying or selling as if they were going to battle. It never goes down well."
623747,Skipper D,2011-09-22 11:44:00,1970,"  Thats right Roy , i like to be a little more suttle , heres one tho just to show how it can be , coming thru a small town last summer, on a lawn was a salt spreader , 100 or best offer , did'nt need it but picked it up for 80 , asked 750 last week on kijiji , sold sunday for 500 .  Very smooth sailing ....lol ."
623750,scugpg,2011-09-22 11:48:00,1373," Some people see that if they don't get the last word on the price, than the seller gets the upper hand. Thus they aren't getting their ""perceived"" deal or lose the battle. Whether its fairly priced or not.  That's why not going with firm pricing can avoid this. Using obo can sometimes start a bidding war if you're lucky and maybe you get more than you initially intended.  ""serious inquiries only"" can sometimes deter the lowballers or tirekickers...if you're lucky.  As Roy put it, things can seem like a battle over $10"
623752,smally21,2011-09-22 11:52:00,993,"it bothers me that most of these offers are based on what joe cheapo wants to pay, not what the item is worth.  the idea is to come up with a fair, market value price.  i dont mind offers from a buyer that did their homework, demonstrates other adds to show my item selling cheaper. but to offer 200 on a 500 dollar listinds without doiing some basic research on the item - go pound salt fella.  it is not worth your time responding but i usually cant help myself"

623880,adolson,2011-09-22 16:47:00,783," I think part of the reason is because there's less to discuss in a report post - you tell your story, you post your pics, and that's all there really is to it. It's appreciated and interesting, and I try to see them all, or at least most of them, but I don't comment on all of them because usually others have said all that can be said, and I rarely go back in because discussions don't usually happen much in there.. I could be way wrong about this, but that's how I look at it. I think it'd be a good idea to have NF stuff in it's own section, though, so the good stuff doesn't get pushed off the front page so easily, but that's not my call and I'm sure there's a reason why it isn't."

Each item was priced cheaply in order to facilitate a quick sale.  Prices are listed as being firm.  I've had a total of 17 pm's from different people.  Every one (except one notable exception) either offered me less money or wanted to trade me something.  What gets me is some of these offers were for $10-$20 less than my firm price.  When you stand firm on the price you never hear back from them.  An already great price and people quibble over a few bucks? LOL!  Here's a hint stop wasting my time!  In the future I won't respond to any more inquiries like that.  Rant over."

623664,ccmtcanada,2011-09-22 01:06:00,7971, Mmmmmm donuts...  Seriously though...that is funny Rizzo!!!
623665,GBW,2011-09-22 01:08:00,8460,"what do you mean you aren't going to give it to me for free?!?!?!  Ok, kidding aside...  I hate that too.  if I don't see firm I often ask what is a decent price for both parties to prevent the bickering over a few bucks.   Only when the post has a $ and O.B.O. listed do I do this.  And Kijiji is BRUTAL!"
623666,fish_fishburn,2011-09-22 01:11:00,1311,I never reply to ads where the price is firm. I like to put in an offer and go from there. What's wrong with that?
623667,ccmtcanada,2011-09-22 01:11:00,7971,"I've purchased a lot on kijiji and unless I see something terribly wrong with the item, I pay the asking price.  I recently purchased an adult 10 speed bike from someone locally...when I expressed an interest but couldn't make it out to see it right away, they said they'd hold it for a few days for me.  When I saw it, it was a fair asking price, so I added $10 for their courtesy in holding it for me.  I have sold a few items as well...and inflated the price on purpose so that I could negotiate down to the minimum I'd accept."
623669,MJL,2011-09-22 01:12:00,2427,"Mike, I'll trade you CCMT's soul for the 13' Rainshadow"
623670,HTHM,2011-09-22 01:13:00,4082,"HMMM, Solo's selling stuff!??? I'm checkin' the classifieds"
623673,ccmtcanada,2011-09-22 01:14:00,7971, And what exactly do I get in that deal???? ROFL  Mmmmmmm....donuts....
623674,woodenboater,2011-09-22 01:14:00,2277,"Seriously ? I am/ was this close >< to pm'ing you about your Guidewater jacket. The price is way more than fair if it's in decent condition and Patagucci gear stands the test of time, judging by the capilene I have  I may still pm you if I can't keep my GAS under control lol."
623676,mercman,2011-09-22 01:16:00,7054,  Peace of Mind You helped a Bud get a great deal
623681,Dozer,2011-09-22 01:26:00,896,"First time selling somethng on the internet?  Buckle up, you're in for a bumpy ride."
623684,ctranter,2011-09-22 01:35:00,543,"You were selling quality gear at great prices.  If people low-ball you, just laugh and move on.  Cheap people will always try to be cheap.  If I didn't buy a GLX last season, I'd be all over that Rainshadow.  ps. I'm seriously mulling over the fly reel, but I take gear purchases very, very seriously."
623685,Bondar,2011-09-22 01:37:00,817,I feel your pain !!!
623688,adolson,2011-09-22 01:44:00,783,"Haha! I know this exact pain and concur heartily. It's worse when you tell them no, and they agree to the price you asked, and then they give you less money ANYHOW! This happened to me once, and I didn't notice until after they left, but I wasn't going to go after them and start trouble for $5 or $10, whatever it was.. But wow, talk about ballsy. I count money now, of course - learned that lesson just the once."
623689,NAW,2011-09-22 01:49:00,4022,"This is something that chaps my   too.  But I've learned to deal with it.  I don't want to list an item for more the what I think it's worth, just so the price can get bartered down.  I want to list it for what it's worth, and sell if for what it's worth.  You have to play the buyers game when selling.  My views on bargaining totally changed after reading the book ""Getting to Yes"".  I wish they made the book mandatory in schools.  It's about ""Principled"" bargaining."
623692,bigugli,2011-09-22 01:53:00,6138,"Regretably, this is the way a free market system works. I go through this every week at St Jakobs. Firm, or fair, mean nothing. All that matters is the deal. I've simply developed a very thick skin and some sharp cutting sarcasm. Sure beats banging the head against the wall."
623717,spooner_jr,2011-09-22 03:44:00,193,"""price is $40 firm, or if you want to negotiate, $60 obo."""
623728,Big Cliff,2011-09-22 08:07:00,6899,"I have sold a few items in the classifieds here over the years, never had any trouble getting my asking price. If the price is fair and the quality is good then it should be a win win for both parties."
623729,singingdog,2011-09-22 10:02:00,1047,"Comes with the territory of using a free service to sell your goods. Don't take it personally....it's just folks trying to get a better deal. I deal with it on a daily basis at my studio....folks thinking that if they buy 4 plates I should sell it for less than the asking price, or lowballing me on stuff that I consider to be more than fairly priced. Usually it's just entertaining....sometimes it's irritating. One thing I will say.....nobody every gives you a discount if you don't ask."
