I never see any boats in there but it looks like a decent spot. If you are allowed, where can you launch? Also, what types of fish are there, if any?  Thanks,  long time fisherman, short time member"
624589,ld17,2011-09-24 21:28:00,319,no motors allowed.  no boat launch.  you can hand bomb it from the park and work a trolling motor.  your better off fishing the harbour with a good launch out of bay front.

624599,smally21,2011-09-24 22:01:00,993,there are scattered pike in the bsyfront. cross your fingers!
624691,northernpike56,2011-09-25 02:14:00,717,"At bayfront and cootes I've got pike, largemouth bass, salmon, crappies, perch, sunfish, sheepshead, carp, bullheads, walleye, and LOTS of gobys... If you fish at cootes paradise right under the bridge where the 403 crosses over you'll mostly pull up bullheads, sheepsheads, and carp. At bayfront, you'll catch largemouth bass, panfish, carp, sheepshead, and some pike that hang around the harbour. This time of year last year I got a big salmon at bayfront with a red devil spoon as well.  "
