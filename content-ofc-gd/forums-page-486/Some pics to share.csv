624549,Twocoda,2011-09-24 18:11:00,4130,Nice shootin!...great composition on the first pic...every fisherman should have that shot on his/her wall
624726,l2p,2011-09-25 06:46:00,346,"Haha thanks! Although I don't credit myself as a photographer, nothing more than me going out fishing with a nice camera lol. I have to admit though, it feels good to know that people appreciate the pics I take  Well heres some more from the last trip, anyone else fish in that crazy rain last friday? It was definitely worth it.  Enjoy        And why it was worth it for me    Tightlines!"
624727,rocheleauc,2011-09-25 08:12:00,205,wow! great pictures.
624733,dave524,2011-09-25 11:21:00,4508,More great fish and pictures   How did the Atlantic perform in the river ?
624796,l2p,2011-09-25 16:55:00,346,Like nothing ive every fought before! Super fast runs and aerials that even a bow cant compare to. I cant wait til we start seeing them in big numbers again... although I have a feeling it will take quite some time.
624906,Leecher,2011-09-26 01:53:00,7832,Great report fish and pics l2p The brown pics are awesome Thanks for sharing Leechman
624933,Remastered,2011-09-26 03:45:00,143,L2P really knows his stuff. Take note my friends.
624935,l2p,2011-09-26 05:57:00,346,"Haha thanks, but there isnt any rocket science behind fishing for fish that will actually bite! Im sure alot are tempted to just fish for nooks since there are so many but bellow the 100s of them sit the fish that I actually target. The best feeling is drifting a pool with tonnes of visible chinnys clearly avoiding my line like i want them to then my float shooting down and from all those dark boots is a glimmer of chrome  Ofcourse sometimes its inevitable and you will hook into chinnies, thats why I use small thin steelhead hooks so i can just bend them out"
624951,WeedLine,2011-09-26 12:21:00,322,Amazing fish and great pics. Well done.
623722,l2p,2011-09-22 06:04:00,346,          And probably one of the biggest boots i ever caught  
623725,[emailÂ protected],2011-09-22 07:03:00,97,  Some beauts you got there dude.. That brown in the third pic is just ... just.....don't have words for it ...Hopefully one day I'll have the good fortune of holding up such a majestic creature...  Tightlines! N
623735,turtle,2011-09-22 10:50:00,274,"Nice brown!  The term ""loogan"" reminds me of my youth 35 year ago in Scarborough, meaning idiot or crazy."

623780,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-22 13:05:00,2690,"The brown is a beauty. The coho (first shot with the giant kype) is pretty sweet, too."

623794,Harrison,2011-09-22 13:42:00,2202,Awesome.
623795,codegreen,2011-09-22 13:49:00,9,"Sorry, excuse my noobishness but what does the term ""loogan"" mean? Is it someone who doesn't know how to creek/river fish properly?  "
623868,dave524,2011-09-22 16:16:00,4508,"Beauty   Love the Coho's, way better sportfish in the river than chinnies  The second one (4th pic)is as chrome as any fresh run steelhead. Remember targeting them 20 years ago in a Mississauga River   when there was a good late Nov/Dec run and the crowds had thinned, best coloured baits were dark green, what we referred to as ""Kelly green"" not the more yellow chartreuse."
