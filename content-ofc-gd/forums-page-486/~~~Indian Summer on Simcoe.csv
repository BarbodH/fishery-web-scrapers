We hit quite a few spots first out deep 60' then into 50' and spent some time at 42' where we got into a massive school of Perch, now if they just 9"" longer they be keepers. I thought we would check out the fleet sitten off Beaverton in 36', but very little was happening so we headed back out to the out to a spot had marked with a Red X on the side of my boat, and we could see the Perch swimming just under the boat in 39'marking all the way down to the bottom, so after weeding through a lot of Dinks we took home a 1/2 doz for supper. I like to say Thanks James it was fun phishen with you."
