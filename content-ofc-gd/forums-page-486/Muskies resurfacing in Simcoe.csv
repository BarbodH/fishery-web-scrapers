624227,F_ast,2011-09-23 17:11:00,154,"The biggest difference in the GBay strain muskie and the Kawartha muskie (other than potential size/ mass) is that Gbay muskie (or any muskie that survive in with a heavy pike population) is that they spawn twice; from what I understand.  I typical shallow spawn that is early and closer to the pike spawn and then a deeper spawn a few weeks later; which is away from the typical spawning grounds.  I beleive this info came from a Wisconsin study on Leech lake strain several years ago.  But it appears that most co-existing muskie follow this routine.  I would have thought any Norhter Muskie strain, GBay, through the french river and Nippissing,  NW Ontario or the Larry would suffice as all these areas have healthy Pike/ muskie populations."
624229,mike rousseau,2011-09-23 17:15:00,4661,"  Why bother tho...?  There are plenty of lakes to catch musky...  I understand that simcoe would grow some giant musky...

624236,Musky or Specks,2011-09-23 17:28:00,2710,Except of coarse that pike and musky that co-exist use two different spawning habitats. If pike and musky spawn in the same place Pike predation wipes out the musky hatch. That why when pike are introduced to the Kawartha's the musky population plummets. There are two distinct breeding habits for musky. Riverine and Lackustrine. Not going to go into detail google it. One co-exist with pike one doesn't. It is the spawning habitat of the former that is ruined in Simcoe.
624245,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 17:57:00,184, I can see your point and this is a good debate.  But the GB strain has never been tried in Simcoe has it? You are comparing the spawning habitat of Lakers and whitefish to that of musky.
624250,Musky or Specks,2011-09-23 18:11:00,2710,For the riverine spawning musky it is very similar yes and that habitat is ruined from shoreline encroachment and urbanization.
624251,jimmer,2011-09-23 18:11:00,2730,"Find a financial backer first. The MNR says it's too expensive to raise walleye fry for them to initiate it. That's what I have heard anyways whenever the Kawarthas comes up. Hmmmm, I think they raise them in Haliburton. Simcoe would be a great walleye fishery and perfect for big walleye tournaments. It would be nice to target them in the winter."
624262,cram,2011-09-23 18:32:00,1733, Doubt you'll see them supplementing an existing population with hatchery fish in Ontario.  Screws with teh genetics of that population.
624279,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 19:06:00,184," I agree that there is shoreline damage as more and more development comes to the lake.  I'm hoping these fish will use the numerous mid-lake shoals and weed beds to spawn.  I've lived beside and fished this lake my entire life and I know it quite well. I think the large pike I've caught in the Virginia beach area are spawning in deeper, rockier water than the pike in Cooks Bay. To me it seems like there is still some usable habitat for these fish."

624290,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 19:44:00,184," No,it won't.  But Musky reproducing in lake Simcoe? I'm going to remain positive and say yes it will happen."
624297,Familyfisherman,2011-09-23 19:54:00,188,"Interesting thread -- thanks for starting it kickinfrog...  There are already some Musky on Simcoe -- each year bass anglers have them follow up to the boat, and some adult fish are caught and released annually.  Not many, but it happens.  While I can't comment intelligently on Muskies Canada's plans, I certainly wouldn't discourage them.  The lake clearly had an excellent population at one time.  With the ever increasing water quality and protected habitat at the end of Cooks Bay for spawning, I don't see why a population might not do ok?  Competing with pike isn't new...it may take time and patience but let's give them both.  Jason Borwick is the Biologist at the MNR responsible for Lake Simcoe, and I've been to his presentations on the state of the water, whitefish, and most recently naturally reproducing Lake Trout poplulations -- great information.  They are totally on it when it comes to the state of the Lake Simcoe fisheries.  I would expect MC has been in contact with the MNR and have Jason's and others blessing on their efforts.  If it was a complete waste of time and resources, I expect the MNR would've stated as much, wouldn't they?  While more walleye would be great, MC obviously is an advocate for Musky.  Impossible to please everybody..."

I for one think it would be neat to have muskies in Simcoe.  I applaud those that are at least giving it a try to bring them back.  Jim
624323,Musky or Specks,2011-09-23 20:41:00,2710,There's a world of difference in a musky fishery and a self sustaining musky population. We could definately have an awesome musky fishery on Simcoe and I have no problem with that. But let's concentrate the effort that way instead of wasting time and effort to create a self sustaining population. (Just stock the piss out of it) Similar to the Grand River Trout fishery the goal was a self sustaining population but when it was realized that wasn't going to happen but that the fishery in and of itself had an intrinsic value Resources could be more focused. No more artificial spawning channels etc.
624329,Terry,2011-09-23 21:04:00,14456,I will tell you in 10 or so years if it's a good idea or a waste of money  until then....well I remember when one could catch big muskie on simcoe and i have caught my share and would love to see it again

624374,Kerry,2011-09-23 23:03:00,383,"The funny or sad part to me depending on how you look it is not too many years ago I read a story on muskies in cooch dying off of old age.The story went on about the lack of people actively fishing for them.I have to admit before I got the bug we fished really only for bass/walleye and pike.I have seen and been over top of muskies easily pushing the 30 lb plus mark in my youth in the shallow portions of the narrows during the spring around spawning time and couldn't believe we could glide a canoe right up on one and not spook it.I have seen a couple of mounts of over 40 lb fish from cooch that are from the 60's back when they were obviously more plentiful. Anyway no sooner had I decided I was going to try for them on cooch when the following year it is cut off to help the fishery in Simcoe recover.Personally even though they are connected and bass are known to travel from one lake to the other I think each lake has its' own population and they don't share the same water.I don't think muskies are viewed with the same reverence or ever will be in this watershed as they are in the Kawarthas or other lakes with a reputation for numbers or size.Simcoe is known for its' perch,bass,lakers and whities and really doesn't need any more help unless they want to allow us 2 herring too.In that case I'd be a real happy fisherman.

624464,Skud,2011-09-24 13:10:00,739,"I believe the biggest threat to the muskie in Simcoe is the thousands of people who fish it and don't know the regs, don't care about the regs or can't tell the difference between pike and muskie.  They will continue to be fished out for dinner."

Canada has(Simcoe aside) a completely self sustaining Muskie population, the cost to stock per fish is crazy expensive. We need to protect our resources."
624113,kickingfrog,2011-09-23 11:50:00,8333,"http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3309195  Muskies resurfacing in Simcoe ‘Viable fishery’ now possible By GISELE WINTON SARVIS – Special to QMI Agency Posted 1:00am Sept 23, 2011 Muskellunge are slowly returning to Lakes Simcoe and Couchiching, but open season for the fishery could be 10 years away, according to Muskies Canada president Ian Young.  ""There is no chance of the fishery opening soon,"" he said.  Muskies Canada, a non-profit organization with 600 members, along with a dozen environmental groups, have undertaken the ""huge"" project of bringing back a species from the lakes that was locally extinct.  ""We have been stocking the lake for six years for a total of 4,000 to 5,000 fingerlings,"" Young said.  Another 2,000 will put stocked this fall at five strategic locations that were known to be traditional muskie spawning grounds.  ""Several more years of stocking is needed and then assessment before the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) would even consider opening the fishery,"" Young said. ""A viable muskie fishery now and in the future is our goal.""  The oldest muskie in the lakes come from the original stocking in 2004-05. They are just reaching spawning age and are approximately 20 to 30 inches long. It is a critical time in re-establishing a self-reproducing muskie population, Young said.  Re-establishing this top predator has come at a cost of $100,000 and thousands of volunteer hours. The project has won an award as the top fishing conservation project in Canada in 2010. It's Canada's only muskie stocking program.  ""The last thing you want is to wreck it before it becomes established,"" Young said.  If anyone catches a muskie, they can take measurements and then return the fish to the lake. Anglers can then report those measurements to the MNR.  A century ago, muskellunge were so plentiful in the lakes there was a commercial fishery and heavy recreational fishing. Commercial catches were in the 10,000-pound range and there were no limits for individual fishermen. There was no such thing as catch and release in the early 1900s.  ""They were all killed,"" Young said.  During the 20th century, overfishing, habitat degradation and water pollution all led to dwindling numbers of muskie until 20 years ago when the species was formally deemed extinct.  About 10 years ago, the Lake Simcoe Muskie Restoration Project was started with more than 12 partners, including the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and the Georgian Bay Hunters and Anglers.  Muskie required an abundance of food. They eat perch, northern pike, walleye, catfish, bass, suckers and even a northern water snake. The freshwater species require good oxygen levels and a silty, marshy bottom to spawn. Unlike lake trout, they don't require cold, deep water.  Muskies grow to be huge fish. The biggest muskie ever caught was in Georgian Bay. It weighed 55 pounds, was 60 inches long and had a girth of 27 inches.  Muskies are only found in lakes in eastern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and the northeastern United States, including Michigan and rivers flowing to the east coast including the St. John and St. Lawrences rivers.  Locally, there are viable populations in Georgian Bay and the Kawartha Lakes. The muskies in the Kawartha Lakes have an advantage over those elsewhere because they have little competition for food. The northern pike is the muskies No. 1 competitor and they are absent from some Kawartha Lakes. They are lots of pike in the Lake Simcoe watershed.  This poses a striking problem for the return of muskie because both carnivorous species spawn in the spring in similar marshy habitats.  ""The pike hatch three or four weeks earlier and they eat whatever is around, including musky hatchlings,"" Young said.  It also poses a problem for getting muskie eggs to raise because researchers wanted eggs from muskie parents that have been exposed to northern pike. Therefore, they couldn't get fish from Kawartha Lakes. They did find some from Gloucester Pool of the Severn River.  Then the challenge is to raise the fish that are cannibalistic and perpetually hungry to a size where they can stocked into Lake Simcoe, Young said.  The minimum size required to keep a caught muskie varies. It's 36 to 44 inches in the Kawartha lakes, 38 inches in Georgian Bay and 54 inches in the St. Lawrence."
624114,GbayGiant,2011-09-23 11:55:00,1780,This is a joke right? There are a few point that are completely wrong.
624124,Tom McCutcheon,2011-09-23 12:21:00,627,It is no joke. However I see where there may be some missed quotes printed. The most glaring one would be the size limit for Georgian Bay. 54 inches not 38.

624148,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 13:51:00,184,"Good post. There are a few mistakes like the biggest musky caught - no big deal. The point is that this is an amazing project and it looks like it is going to work. I can remember seeing big fish in the 70's being brought in to Miller's Marina in Keswick. It was sad to see them eventually disappear because of the growing pike population. The same thing is now happening to Balsam Lake where more and more pike are being caught. The Ministry is right by bringing musky eggs from Georgian Bay. I believe that the Kawartha strain of musky (that was in Simcoe) and the Georgian Bay strain are two different fish. Maybe the GB strain spawn in deeper water to avoid the hatch being eaten by pike. Anyway, with the type of forage available for musky in Lake Simcoe - Whitefish especially, these fish could grow to be monsters just like their brothers in GB. Too bad I'll probably be to old to throw 3 oz. baits at them when they open fishing for Musky on Simcoe. Oh well, I'm teaching my son to fish for Musky."

However I still feel that Muskie went the way of the dodo bird in Simcoe for a reason and I don't ever see all the hard work panning out.  Now if as dedicated a group was to take on a similar project for a more sought after species on Simcoe...pick one...the efforts would have been appreciated by far more people.  Again I hope it works out. I just wanted to add my full 3 Cents worth.
624179,Musky or Specks,2011-09-23 14:44:00,2710,Agree I've stated my views in the past and quit Muskies Canada because of this waste of resources
624186,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 15:11:00,184,"If musky from the Kawartha Lakes were being stocked I could see your point, a waste of time. The Georgian bay fish have co-existed with pike for years. Why wouldn't this work?  Unless of course you don't want Musky in Lake Simcoe."

624193,Tom McCutcheon,2011-09-23 15:29:00,627," I suppose that the research being conducted on Balsam Lake by the MNR and MCI is a waste of time and resources also. When an angler in the Kawartha's is only able to encounter one or two muskies a season and has trouble keeping the hammer handle pike off the bait, people will be questioning if something could have been done to prevent that from happening. Part of MCI's mandate it to conserve and protect the natural resources we all share.  Tom McCutcheon Chairman Kawartha Chapter Muskies Canada Inc."

Why not just stock lakes without many pike...? Then the efforts being put out will actualy make a difference...  Why bother with simcoe?  Then the trout... Whitefish... And perch populations get effected...  I dunno...  Simcoe has a healthy fishery and plent of tourism...  Why not put the efforts in somewhere that could use the tourism boost and better fishery?

Habitat degradation is destroying several habitats in Simcoe that will never recover. Musky/Lake Trout/Whitefish/Herring. If what you want is a put and take fishery for musky similar to the Lake Trout/Whitefish fishery that is there, then fine but you don't need Musky Canada's time and resources for that."
624206,Tom McCutcheon,2011-09-23 15:58:00,627,"  Good questions and understandable. I don't think I am qualified to answer all of them.  The muskie fishery in Simcoe at one time was one of the best in Ontario. I don't think they had any problem defending their territory from pike. It was over harvesting by commercial fishing and unlimited size and possession limits which caused the numbers to eventually drop to zero. That along with antiquated taxidermy (skin mounts) as opposed to replica, and catch and release was unheard of in those days. Today we are much wiser and a lot of us release large bass and perch to continue with the gene pool. It is believed by a number of biologists (which I am not) that pike and muskie can co-exist in Simcoe again."
624208,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 16:03:00,184,"  I'll try to answer some of your questions with answers that are strictly my opinion.  Guys that enjoy catching and eating pike should have no problem finding a lake where they can do so. Pike are not going to be extinct. Even if musky establish in Simcoe you will still be able to catch pike.  Why stock a lake that has pike that will eat the musky? Well, like I said in my previous post - pike and musky have co-existed in Georgian Bay for years showing that it can be done. You just need the GB strain of musky.  As for the trout, whitefish and perch populations, I think they are strong enough on Simcoe to support a musky fishery. They supported musky before."
624213,BillM,2011-09-23 16:08:00,17367,Muskie on Simcoe seems like a waste (at least to me)  Start stocking walleyes in there or something.  They'd flourish with all the baitfish.  Would be a fantastic put and take fishery.
624214,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 16:14:00,184, I must respectfully disagree with you.  If the habitat in Simcoe is healthy enough to support a reproducing pike population (which I believe it is) then musky will be able to survive and reproduce also.
624215,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 16:18:00,184, I agree 100%. More walleye in Simcoe would be awesome!  How do we start a walleye stocking program?
