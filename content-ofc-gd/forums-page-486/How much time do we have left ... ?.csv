623352,Skipper D,2011-09-21 10:50:00,1970,"  Thats great , perch in December ... wow ,  i own one of the larger snow removel companies in the north end of the city  now twenty five years in the making , before it was clean snow then try to sleep which is hard to do while theres day light , now that i under stand how you guys handle the sport i'll be able clean snow then fish and no one will think am nuts , maybe i should buy an ice breaker boat adding it to the fleet and start keeping the bay open all winter .........lol"
623356,mike rousseau,2011-09-21 11:03:00,4661,Dec 11 last year...  Every year I get out at least once in December...  Also  I find it's a good idea to run you motor for 10-20 seconds on the trailer trimmed down... This should get most of the water out...  And I run stabilizer starting in November... Every tank gets some cause you don't know wich is gunna be your last for the year...
623363,Skipper D,2011-09-21 11:15:00,1970,"  I'll keep all that good stuff that your saying mike in mind . I got to get you and my brother Roger conected some time..,"
623368,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-21 11:23:00,2690,"Hoping to keep her (the boat) out until early November, but, usually get into steelhead mode by then.  Might actually try chasing a few near shore chromies with the boat this year, if the winds cooperate.  Like pretty much everyone here has stated...all depends on your comfort level.  If the water isn't frozen your good to go. Speaking of frozen, hoping to use the ice hut a few more times this year"
623370,Skipper D,2011-09-21 11:36:00,1970,  You give me the numbers off your hut and i'll make sure the ice breaker stays clear..... lol . I guess dress warm is all ya can do and see how much you can take and have some one's at home maning the stove.
623384,corvette1,2011-09-21 12:14:00,1765,if you fish the lower niagara all year awesome fishing
623584,Rizzo,2011-09-21 20:37:00,4754,you should have to brush snow off it several times and break ice at the launch at least once or twice before its over. Put bag of salt in your vehicle so when the ramp freezes over (from you launching earlier) you can get back out! For me its Dec. 15 - last day of musky fishing
623755,Steve,2011-09-22 12:03:00,2075,put the boat away?  why?  many bodies of water allow open water boat fishing in January/February/and March.
623759,Skipper D,2011-09-22 12:15:00,1970,"  I got it , make thru those three months then i'll have it licked ..lol.... am learning all the time since i sign on here . Glad to hear it from the die hards , maybe one day here soon i'll be known as one too . See you's out there ."
623879,Tybo,2011-09-22 16:45:00,1373,I carry two snow shovels and a ice chipper.The ramp get cleaned fast when you have shovel for your fishing partner.
623898,irishfield,2011-09-22 17:16:00,26272,"I take my shovel tooo Paul.. lol  This was Dec 7th 2009, unfortunate that the bay froze over that night!"
623927,Lungelarry,2011-09-22 18:32:00,294,Until its realllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly cold......................... 
624029,mike rousseau,2011-09-23 00:00:00,4661,  Great picture...  You know it's cold when... Lol
624078,Skipper D,2011-09-23 02:33:00,1970,"you guys just don't give up , very serious bunch ...LOL , I LIKE THE PLOW TRUCK AT THE LAUNCH !"
624082,NAW,2011-09-23 02:43:00,4022, Where you trailoring the boat while plowing the ramp.  Now that would have been impressive
624090,Sinker,2011-09-23 04:06:00,8692,We always break a little ice to get out the last time.          S.
624091,GoneFishin,2011-09-23 04:09:00,349,Who puts there boat away?  
624097,Bondar,2011-09-23 06:31:00,817,     like i said its just getting started LOL  carry salt and a spliting axe for the ramp
624126,Familyfisherman,2011-09-23 12:25:00,188,"Fish till the end of November for sure -- great fishing, just wear a floater suit if you have one..."
624429,Skipper D,2011-09-24 04:57:00,1970,"  And still the diehards keep coming , i never knew so many were out at that time of year doing what i was thinking of doing . Hi fives to all of you ."
624434,Moosebunk,2011-09-24 09:35:00,3970,December 4rth.  I think that was my last day out on Quinte.  Lotsa time left.
624472,Skipper D,2011-09-24 14:00:00,1970,"  I hear the Quinte is the place to be , maybe one day i'll have to take the boat after visiting my Mom in Kingston  or maybe before...lol..lol ."
623272,Skipper D,2011-09-21 01:12:00,1970,Being serious this year in taking up this new past time of boating and fishing to finding out that i enjoy it but now has me wondering how much time will i have left to fish from my boat before it gets to cold and leave my self time to get the boat put away safely.
623274,ColdH20guy,2011-09-21 01:17:00,312,Bass runs until the end of November..bundle up and enjoy!!
623275,danbouck,2011-09-21 01:17:00,4380,I pull mine out when I start fishing in a blizzard and have to break ice at the boat house
623277,GBW,2011-09-21 01:21:00,8460,Merry Christmas!
623278,Cudz,2011-09-21 01:21:00,2652,"Jigger and I were out fishing on November 21 last year.  30 mph east wind and some pretty good snow.  Don't put your boat away yet the big boys will be in very very soon. If you want to catch 5+ pound bass on Simcoe without straying too far from shore, Oct-Nov is the best. Going to miss it for sure but I still lurk so I want to see some good fall smallie fish porn!"
623279,GBW,2011-09-21 01:22:00,8460,Good to see you still here checking in C.C.
623280,mercman,2011-09-21 01:23:00,7054,"I put mine away waaaayyyyy to early last year.This year its staying out as long as there is no ice on the water.Most of the water should drain out of the motor when its on the trailer, so it shouldnt be a problem.Just keep the charger pluged in when its colder."
623281,manitoubass2,2011-09-21 01:25:00,11391,"November 17th was my last day in a boat last  year. It was minus 27 with the wind chill, I was abit under prepared. Lasted about 3 hours tops, fishing was great though"
623282,Bondar,2011-09-21 01:27:00,817,The boating season just starts to get good around here in november .... Pretty well everyone Is gone by then and the river is at its best
623283,irishfield,2011-09-21 01:27:00,26272,At least 2 1/2 months Skipper... or at least we'd better have !!  
623286,Skipper D,2011-09-21 01:30:00,1970,"Iam not to worried about my self enduring the elliments , but No worries about freezing up the bottom end of the motors , should be ok in a heated garage ......."
623287,Skipper D,2011-09-21 01:33:00,1970," i love it , good picture shows it all , thanks Wayne"
623289,ccmtcanada,2011-09-21 01:45:00,7971,My latest day in a boat was the end of November...the 29th to be exact in 2008...launched through a skim of ice on the Bay of Quinte...  
623291,Skipper D,2011-09-21 01:45:00,1970,"THATS AWSOME , no  more weekend boaters, had not thought of that ............. AWSOME , guaranted  i'll be there then til the end ........"
623292,backbay,2011-09-21 01:48:00,773,I'll pack it in the second weekend of November when it's time to close the cottage....
623293,Grimace,2011-09-21 01:49:00,2020,This is just the beginning of my favourite time of year.
623297,Skipper D,2011-09-21 01:57:00,1970,"  so realy theres no tricks to keeping the motor safe , i am glad to hear theres no need to worrie . My brother Roger is coming up form Cornwall on the seventh of October , we have it plan to do a week of fishing on the Simcoe , lol..thats if Baby la la can but the hours in that i like to spend when i go out ."
623300,Skipper D,2011-09-21 02:07:00,1970,"  I sure will , seeing where your from , i put my boat in off Lawson road back in july and took it west for the day , had a blast other then there was no dock to leave or come back to ........."
623302,cram,2011-09-21 02:10:00,1733, That's what you call cruising in style.  Could be comfortable in that right up to ice up.
623307,Skipper D,2011-09-21 02:15:00,1970,"  Thats great to know , come say hi if you see two guys out there looking like Jimmy Flyn and one hugging the boat heater , that will be baby la la ..lol"
623315,Jigger,2011-09-21 02:32:00,1237," Looking back on it brings a smile to my face   . Looking at the lake that day, not so much so..."
623322,Skipper D,2011-09-21 02:43:00,1970,
623323,NAW,2011-09-21 02:45:00,4022,My boat stays in until the ice is to thick to break through at the launch.  Got a few more months yet.
623324,Skipper D,2011-09-21 02:49:00,1970,  hope you leave me a few perch out .lol...lol
623337,crappieperchhunter,2011-09-21 04:05:00,2582,I few years back I was on Simcoe Dec17 or 18 perch fishing. Had to ram over an inch of ice out of the marina with my boat to fish...but we sure hammered the perch that day   I think that late a date on Simcoe will be hard for me to beat.  Honestly once we are into December I'd rather be on the ice ice fishing then in the boat.
