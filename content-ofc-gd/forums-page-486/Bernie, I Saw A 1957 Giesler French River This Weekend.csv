It was in mint condition and had been restored by the owner 2 years ago. Nice lines and according to the owner, it is a dream to cruise in. The fellow's from New York State and was surprised to learn that your family is still building boats. I wasn't able to get a pic before he left. There is a group of 10 fathers and sons that have been coming up to Honey Harbour for over 50 years. Anyways, neat boat and I thought I'd share it with you all."
