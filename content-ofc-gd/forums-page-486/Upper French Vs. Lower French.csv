624635,bigcreekdad,2011-09-25 00:00:00,546,Been fishing the upper for 15 years now. I think the fishing has been on a slow decline. Thinking about trying the lower. Any thoughts?

Almost everything looks like it should hold fish and the feeding windows always seem to be critical.  I rarely raise fish (primarily talking muskie) on time outside of a natural feeding window.  I have been fortunate with the muskies on Wolseley Bay area... Compared to most that I speak to anyways.
