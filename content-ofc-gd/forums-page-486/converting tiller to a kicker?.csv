624304,ch312,2011-09-23 20:00:00,1590,i currently have a 15hp tiller on my tinner and was pondering the idea of using it as a kicker on my new boat. i'd like it to have electric trim and steering with the wheel. is this an easy task? would it be more cost effective to sell this one and buy a unit already setup? how much $$$?  thanks

624315,Tom McCutcheon,2011-09-23 20:15:00,627,"There is a unit called ""troll master"" it is an electronic connection between the tiller motor and a small control box near the console. (about $250.00 depending on make of tiller motor) It works really well and in combination with a pirannah steering connection between the tiller and the main motor, everything can be done from the helm."

624345,irishfield,2011-09-23 21:46:00,26272,Two female thread rod ends and a chunk of threaded rod. ONE lock nut and a plastic tube to pretty it up.
624347,irishfield,2011-09-23 21:49:00,26272,"Also, now that I have the troll control throttle unit on the kicker the only thing the shifter is used for is putting it in gear. You could run to the back for that."

624399,irishfield,2011-09-24 00:57:00,26272,For sure Tom... pictures worth a thousand words kinda thing. That's on my boat.... Pro 2 gives you 10x the fineness on speed adjustment and the full throttle burst ..as what you need when the wind gets the nose.  Also looks like he's listened to a few of us. Now advertised as hand held or dash mount... hoping that means he's added a power wire to the 24' cable so it can be hooked up at the motor end. My unit had a short power wire that had to be hooked up at the fixation end.
