He said that a lot of the river below the dam and into fergus is catch & release, you can't use live bait, and all lures have to be single barbless hooks. I think I will start at the dam and work my way downstream ( maybe 1 - 2 km).  So, my questions for you guys are Is that portion of the river C&R with no live bait, barbless hooks, etc. or is it just normal regs?  My second question is what other types of fish are found below the dam? I have fished directly below the dam before and caught a brown trout, a few pike, a few bass, and a tonne of bullheads. A guy once told me that there was walleye and perch below the dam but I have yet to catch one...  My third question is what types of lures should I be using? The water looks pretty muddy in most parts so would I be best off using lures like spinners that create vibration or could spoons and plugs work too? I have the whole assortment of lures in my tackle box but no idea what to be bringing.  Any feedback would help me out so much as I have put In lots of hours there with not too much to show for it.  Thanks in advance  Matt."
624346,miller,2011-09-23 21:49:00,223,best suggestion is grab a copy of the regs from your local tackle shop and keep it in your tackle. you can also find the regs online here  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/Publication/STEL02_163615.html  as for lures spinners are a great choice because many species will hit them just remember to swich to a single hook and pinch the barb if those rules apply to that area.
624349,SirCranksalot,2011-09-23 21:55:00,3291,"I happened to have the regs nearby but they are complicated in that area, but it sounds like normal regs in the gorge area. I'm not too sure where the Bissel dam is but I understand it's upstream from the gorge. The special restrictions apply again downstream of 'a bridge located at the southern boundary of the Elora Gorge Cons area"""

624466,northernpike56,2011-09-24 13:13:00,717,  thanks so much for helping me out!! I really appreciate it!!!
624692,northernpike56,2011-09-25 02:17:00,717,would a #2 bluefox vibrax spinner with a single barbless hook work in the grand or is that a little bit to big for the trout there? I have micro spinners to bucktail spinners but I'm not sure what ones to be changing the hooks on  thanks
