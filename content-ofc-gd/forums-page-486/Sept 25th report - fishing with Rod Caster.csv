624926,adolson,2011-09-26 03:20:00,783,"Originally I was supposed to fish yesterday but didn't have a vehicle until too late in the day, and so I invited my cousin (we'll continue to call him Adam) to either head to Liberty (AGAIN) or a brookie lake today instead. He couldn't make it today, so it looked like my weekend would be ruined...  Luckily for me, OFC's own Rod Caster invited me to meet up and test out that lake we hit last time, to make sure we didn't just get ""lucky"" or if it was because of a full moon, or something.  So we get there probably between 4 and 4:30pm and load up his Sportspal with all our gear and snacks and away we go.  We headed pretty much straight to our little spot, and we jigged here for a while, and nothing. We drifted around with nary a bite. Kinda like last time, there was not much going on here until the sun starts to set, so we headed towards shore to cast for bass. Chad got a little tiny one that flipped off the hook, and shortly afterwards, he saw a little guy chasing after his creepy crawler plastic bait. It was cool to see - if I had been more prepared, I could have filmed it because it was clear shallow water. After, I don't know, 45-60 seconds he committed and he landed the first fish of the day. We cast a while more, but no luck.  The sun was getting low in the sky, so it was time to head back to see if we had left any wallies in the hole. It wasn't long before we both hooked into fish - we started off with a bang of a double-header. Mine was tiny! Chad's was much bigger, but I don't think we got a picture of it.   We were off to a good start. It was definitely slower than last time, but only slightly. The fish weren't hammering on the bait as hard, so you really had to pay attention and feel for the nibbles.  After the first two, I think I landed four more before Chad finally got his second, and from there he gradually caught up. I'd pull ahead, catch up, pull ahead, and so on.       Alt. angle:   lol:                       Eventually I was up 9-8 and at this point, I lost count, but I know he pulled ahead of me and kept the lead. For a brief period there, I felt like I might come out on top this time, but nope. Not only did he get the first fish of the day, he got the first walleye of the day (seconds before mine), and the biggest of the day, biggest One That Got Away of the day, and the most fish of the day. Outclassed in every way, except maybe in hair? My new self-cut uneven shaggy look is hard to beat. Or so I tell myself...    We landed around 30 fish, Chad having a few extra over me. We didn't snap pics of all of them, but enough. At the end of the day, the sun went down, the bite died off, and we headed back to shore. We took home a few fish, but there's more in there for next time. And there will be a next time, sooner or later."

624965,johnnyb,2011-09-26 13:13:00,3413,"So, when you guys go to this lake....do you take Chad's truck?  I just want to make sure I'm following the right vehicle    Great job!"
624967,Rod Caster,2011-09-26 13:27:00,5784,"those glasses make me look like an  . I might as well wear white rimmed lego glasses.  To start the walleye-fest with a double header was quite the event...Dana was ahead 5 - 1 at one point and I had to get my butt in gear to catch up. He's got them dialed in now I tell ya, he's jigging and retrieving like a pro. Dana, now you have to tell your friends that ""jigging for walleye"" doesn't mean working the shoreline and casting spinner baits.  good times!  "
625015,adolson,2011-09-26 16:21:00,783,"    I just assumed anyone with a $10K boat knew what I meant when I said ""let's jig for walleye at that point."" lol  Good times, indeed. Thanks again for the invitation, and instilling me with a need to buy a bush beater so I can get to more and better lakes."
625031,manitoubass2,2011-09-26 16:53:00,11391,"awesome report!  Man, Dana you keep this up you'll be winning tournys by next year!  Beautiful fish"
625063,mercman,2011-09-26 18:02:00,7054,"Nice going Dana !!!! Love the way you pose with the fishies Chad is right, the glasses make his butt look fat !!!!!!!JK Jusr realized its a perch not a bass in your avatar. THATS the one that makes me chuckle when i see it  "
