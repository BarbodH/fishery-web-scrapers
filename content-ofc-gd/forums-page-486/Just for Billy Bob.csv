624481,Skipper D,2011-09-24 14:51:00,1970,"Very informative Wayne , Billy Billy Byou what will you do ................"
624482,glen,2011-09-24 14:52:00,2641,Billy Bob i need you to do some shopping for me.
624502,Roy,2011-09-24 15:33:00,13728, I'm willing to share. Want me to get a haircut for you?
624506,Rod Caster,2011-09-24 15:38:00,5784,I bet those discounts are negotiable
624511,mercman,2011-09-24 15:50:00,7054,  I bet he already tried
624535,Twocoda,2011-09-24 17:28:00,4130,Looks like the best place to get Depends would be the Salvation Army @ 50% off....but im thinking you might not mind paying the extra 30% from K-Mart   Happy hunting BB
624544,Billy Bob,2011-09-24 17:53:00,5865,"Irishcream, your the man....but you missed some...Timmy's has a senior discount on coffee, at least down here in the USA. Sprint gave me $20 off a MONTH for 24 months but it's going to expire in December.  Harrah's Properties in VEGAS is giving us 5 night FREE (my favorite 4 letter word). The USA National Parks are FREE to me as I have a Golden Pass. Use to have a NYS free pass but Patterson revoked it because I'm not blind... Amtrak is free to me on home lines since I did 30 years on the railroad. I also get at least 10 percent off many business in my town because I'm a Volunteer Fire Fighter and my Fire Police badge gets me free launches at some boat launches.  Now get back to work on those Toyota Dealers for me....my son is in the market for one...."
