After 24 yrs in the Printing business I have changed careers.Thanks to an OFC board member memart I am now selling medical supplies a job that I love which consumes more of my time. Here it is my fishing trip with my son Ryan in Mont-St.Michel Quebec over 300kms North of Montreal. www.clubscott.com Enjoy!!!!  look I almost bring more stuff than that solo paddler guy          this year I left the boat at home you just don't need a boat there.These days I just sit back and relax while the little man does all the driving.      Part 2                    Fishing for trout at the dam                           Brown Carp           this is Ryan at the tiller LAST YEAR just to show you how much he has grown.
