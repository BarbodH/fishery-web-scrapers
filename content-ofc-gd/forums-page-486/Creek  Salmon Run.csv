I mean really, I frequent quite a few boards, and this one has to be the worst one for fly fishing discussions.  It seems that whenever the topic comes up, someone has something negative to say about it.  Alot of people love the sport, and likely 99.9% of them are as far from elitist as you can get, much like any other method of fishing.  And just for the record....Yes,  Fly Fishing is a Joke!

""Know your water, Know your prey"" - Fishtracker    HaHa Mike Reminds me of back in September of 1986 when i worked at private Oshawa Golf Club. Kenny Rogers was playing at the Oshawa Civic auditorium. He requested to play a round of golf at the Oshawa Golf Club but was denied because he wasn't a member. I thought maybe they thought he was going to floss/snag/fly fish the Oshawa creek that runs through there. After watching the video you provided,thinking now maybe they were scared of his potential behavior. lol"

618198,ChrisK,2011-09-03 12:29:00,2772,"Like others have said,and so it begins....  Just to add to this reoccurring annual thread a little....If rigged properly fly's can be very effective when run under a float. This eliminates all the horizontal line laying in the river which causes the flossing effect. When I say rigged properly I mean rigged so the fly doesn't drag bottom under the float. When the fly is dragging bottom the float rig is now transformed into a lethal snagging tool so float fishing with a fly or any other presentation for that matter just a little higher than ground zero is a better option when legit fishing for salmon...  I guess what I'm saying here is any form of fishing for salmon in the river can be either legit or turned into something very wrong all pending on the individual using the pole.  We also got to keep in mind too that every year brings new inexperienced fisherman to the rivers that never fished for salmon or even know what flossing fish means or perhaps don't even own a computer to access all this wonderful information we have to offer so its important to ""gently""   educate our new river friends when you see this stuff happening. I'm sure you all do already..."

618203,ChrisK,2011-09-03 12:50:00,2772,"Mike, There's a lot of different ways to rig presentations under a float. Some guys line the rig with shot starting big on top and scale down to the swivel and so on but for the water I fish I like to keep a stealthy presentation which uses very little split shot weight or none at all relying on the weight of the fly to take it to depth all pending on water conditions and if the fly has been tied with its own lead core or not.  Its all about water conditions,silty,deep and fast,deep dead drifts or very shallow.... Thats where your split shot or lack of it will make all the difference in the world."

One of my favorite kinds of fishing though is salmon off the pier or at the mouth. Its pure adrenaline when a big salmon smacks a lure.

616195,craigdritchie,2011-08-27 13:35:00,1586,"That's incorrect. 1. Rainbows spawn in the spring. Salmon spawn in the fall. There is no competition for redds. Rainbow eggs hatch months before the salmon even show up. 2. Chinook salmon fry don't eat smaller rainbows when they're in the stream. They're way too small! Most go directly to the lake right after hatching, some when they're still absorbing the yolk sack.  Remember, rainbows and chinooks have got along perfectly well in Pacific coast streams for tens of thousands of years. If what you say is true, chinooks (and coho and pinks and sockeye and chum) would have completely wiped out Pacific steelhead back when humans still lived in caves."

Next yearis a pink year and there should be close to 7 million salmon in the river at this time of year. The fishing there is awesome because of one thing, yup, the salmon runs!!!! The bows get big scarfing down all them salmon eggs during the spawn. Without the salmon the rivers trout fishery would be just a shadow of what it is. PS it's one of them west coast fisheries."

If you have a soft heart for ethics in angling, stay clear of tribs until October.  Only fresh fish hit baits, and then it is limited to specific fly patterns.

615801,Gregoire,2011-08-26 14:07:00,1397,I know they are starting to stage right now. I don't target them in tribs but good luck.
615813,Harrison,2011-08-26 14:40:00,2202,"I haven't smelt anything yet.  I mean, rotting boots of course."
615816,danbouck,2011-08-26 14:50:00,4380,and it starts...
615818,GBW,2011-08-26 14:55:00,8460,"same, but I did hear that familiar sound of the snagger screech this morning while waiting for the train."
615837,12footspringbok,2011-08-26 15:26:00,459,"I don't think posting when and where the salmon runs are happening on the interwebs is a good idea....  However, I don't think its cool how every one of these threads turns into a joke.   We all know that the salmon run brings out some idiots, and I should hope most people are well aware of that by now. However there are some who do enjoy tangling with fresh run salmon in a legit fashion  come the fall.  Anyway my 2cents...."
615857,mike rousseau,2011-08-26 16:32:00,4661,I used to floss em till I found out what I was actually doing....  So last year I tried skien under a float and landed 3 out of 4 in a couple hours... Way more fun watching the float drop...  And I believe this is a legit way to get em...
615952,Rich,2011-08-26 19:40:00,3927," I'll bet it was the internet that educated you on flossing too. Perhaps that's a point we should not ignore. Yes, we can flame them and call them snaggers & flossers right off the bat, or maybe someone could give them some useful info to let them know there are other ways to catch spawning salmon.  Guess what, they hit spoons and spinners and jerkbaits in the creeks too. Oh, and senkos, swimbaits and just about anything else that imitates a minnow or predatory egg eater.  I don't fish migratory fish anymore, but I never used a marshmallow, earplug, roe bag or treble hook and always did well in the fall."
615988,hendrix,2011-08-26 21:21:00,61,i don't see a difference between bottom bouncing and using a float
615990,Jigger,2011-08-26 21:28:00,1237,Fresh fish > boots
615995,mike rousseau,2011-08-26 21:50:00,4661, Care to explain...  I'd like to know why you think float fishing salmon is the same as snagging...?  Really?  I'm curious?
616008,hendrix,2011-08-26 22:16:00,61, i never said that
616009,mike rousseau,2011-08-26 22:18:00,4661, I misunderstood then...
616013,misfish,2011-08-26 22:31:00,29133," Dont tell me you thought it wouldnt?  Side note,they got them big camping mellos now. Just amagine the ""king""that would chow down on one of them.  Rich you make a good point. Those that say they dont hit in the river are very mistaken. Hot shot with a wiggler,and feal the slam."
616016,John,2011-08-26 22:33:00,2956,I think I'm gonna drink heavily before I sign on for the next month or two!

616025,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-26 22:45:00,10439,OOPs almost forgot. There are over 1.6 million sockeye and kings in the river already and the silvers are coming in good. Just not in Bowmanville!!!!
616026,misfish,2011-08-26 22:48:00,29133,Take off eh.  Wish I had a job there and could live there Dave.
616028,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-26 22:51:00,10439,"  Not here. I have to drive 3,000km to get there. I leave on the 3rd of September!!!!  I'm mostly after them giant resident rainbows though.  Like this 40""+ fish I posted earlier.  "
