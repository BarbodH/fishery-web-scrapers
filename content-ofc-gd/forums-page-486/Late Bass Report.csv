My friend Gone Fishin brought me along for another day of bass fishing last weekend. We fished a little tournament on a Kawartha lake with 8 or 9 boats in it I think. We launched just after 7 and were due back after 3. The fishing that day was slow and we saw several fish crusing along but we managed to get 7 or 8 keepers over the day. And got out 5th and two culls right near the end of the day. It was fun to have the pressure on. We have another small tournament coming up soon, hope we can do just as good or better next time out. We placed 3rd. No money but we had a little under 12 at 11lb 10oz i think it was.  Here are our better 4, still had another little guy but some nice fish overall.  \  Anyway OFC thanks for reading and looking.  Tightlines  MTBF"
