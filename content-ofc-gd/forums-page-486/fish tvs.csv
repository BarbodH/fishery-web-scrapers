624037,Terry,2011-09-23 00:18:00,14456,if fish tv means underwater camera then I can tell you you get what you pay for...  and 200 doesn't get you much...IMHO
624059,Fisherman,2011-09-23 01:16:00,7201,"I just watched a video the other day, a new product from Aqua Vu called Aqua Vu Micro,  The display is about the size of a big pack of cigarettes or cell phone, the camera with incorporated automatic lighting is about the size of a .25c piece with 50 feet of cable. http://www.aquavu.com/store/shop/aqua-vu-micro-camera-system-available-8-25-2011/"
624151,oldphart,2011-09-23 13:53:00,665,"~~~I have the Marcum VS360 which I find is great used it last weekend on Simcoe, lowered the camera down to 45' and had a great clear view of the bottom at 53', the monitor has a 7""screen, and it comes with 60' of cable, bought it on special at Gagnon sports in Oshawa for just under $200"
624155,mike rousseau,2011-09-23 13:59:00,4661,I got the cabelas brand one on sale for 80 bucks...  So far so good...  For that price... I'm very happy with my purchase...
624300,adempsey,2011-09-23 19:55:00,1498," I am so getting one of those!  Was considering a camera for a while, but the cost and the bulk of it has turned me away several times.  Not anymore, that little camera is awesome and perfect for what I wanted to use it for!!  Too bad it's not a 100' cable though."
624317,CRAPPIE,2011-09-23 20:17:00,213,I have one to sell since I don't use it at all.  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-ViewAd?AdId=303627144&MessageId=MSG.VIEW_AD.EDIT_AD_SUCCESSFULMXAdIdMZ303627144MXGuidMZ1319fae4-edc0-a20b-2695-2516ffffa122&mpname=Activity-EditAd&mpuid=1700274%3B15%3B303627144%3B65028725%3B%3B
624348,Fisherman,2011-09-23 21:54:00,7201,"I imagine they will come out with a longer cable in the future.  I had one of the bigger bulky ones, they work very well in clear water like Simcoe, but, it was a beast to lug around."
