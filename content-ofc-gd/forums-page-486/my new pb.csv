624501,monsterfish,2011-09-24 15:33:00,48," I was actually fishing by myself and the lovely lady on shore who took the pics did a great job, but she caught me off guard in that one. I chose the one that best showed the fish.  Trust me I'm beaming inside!  Thanks for all the kind words from everyone!  Keep your hooks sharp!"

625025,F_ast,2011-09-26 16:37:00,154,"I am having a hard time believing that is a Kawartha strain fish.  I do not doubt you got it in a Kawartha lake, but that looks like a Simcoe/ Trent/ Georgian Bay muskie to me.  Thick fish for sure.  Looks like it has October mass already."
