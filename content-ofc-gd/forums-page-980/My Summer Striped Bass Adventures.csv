239147,ehg,2008-08-12 22:52:00,2666,Waterspouts or tornadoes would be scary of course but the more common lightening gets me off the water quick. Nice recent striper report there Rick. ehg
239150,ehg,2008-08-12 23:02:00,2666,"Just realized i replied to wrong thread Rick, great striper fishing there, but the above post is for ' What scares you' thread...."

238882,FishHeadRic,2008-08-12 01:46:00,226,"Fiddle Stix, Snaggle Puss... you two behave now!  Grant, I started catching fish on some of the lures I was just testing so since then I haven't gone so elaborate into the paint jobs. I guess when the winter rolls back in I'll have more time and patience to do so. But I'll tell you what. PM me your address and I'll do up  a nice top water for ya for your muskie adventures.  Fidel. The season hasn't even begun. Just make the time and come down. I promise I'll get you into as many stripers as you want. I wish I could get you into as many stripper as you want but I don't have the cash for that.   Ric"
