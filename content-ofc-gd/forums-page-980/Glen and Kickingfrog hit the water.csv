238424,kickingfrog,2008-08-10 21:46:00,8333,"Glen and I went out on Saturday to see if we could get some fish. The idea was to target some musky and maybe hit-up some bass or walleye depending on how the day unfolded. The forecast was calling for some possible thunderstorms in the afternoon, so the hope was that the fish would be ""on"" before the weather turned. No such luck.  Glen caught this Walleye while trowing a bright green worm in an area that looked more like a bass spot.   Skinny fish, I think it measured out at about 24 inches.   We each caught a small smallmouth before I caught a walleye toward the end of the day.   All and all a fair amount of work for 4 fish and no musky. It rained for about 40 minutes in the middle of the day, but there was no thunderstorms.  It's always good to be on the water. Thanks for the ride Glen."

238445,glen,2008-08-10 23:06:00,2641,Thanks for posting the pics of the pics.  I will let you know when we can get out again.
238490,Bly,2008-08-11 01:12:00,1556,"Seems as though the fishing has been tough for everyone with all this rain but you managed a few nice walleye anyway, good for you guys!"
238504,Smokey,2008-08-11 01:42:00,1278,Great fish and that is the skinniest walleye I've ever seen.
238539,Greencoachdog,2008-08-11 09:05:00,8163,"Thanks for posting that Rob!!!  I'd thought you'd given up fishin' or something!  That first Wall-ice looks much more like a snake than a fish!  Lotsa work for few fish, glad to see y'all hung in there tough and whipped a couple of them!!!"
238708,ccmtcanada,2008-08-11 18:28:00,7971,"Great job out there....the unstable weather has put a damper on my fishing, but I still love to get out there.  If I waited for a guaranteed day to fish without rain, I may not get out at all the way this summer is going.   Nice fish!"
