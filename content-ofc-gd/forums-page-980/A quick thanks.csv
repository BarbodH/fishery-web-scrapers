I recently purchased a hydrographical chart of east Lake Erie, only to discover that I don’t know what most of the symbols mean, and that there is no legend or key on the chart. After fiddling on the internet for a while the idea struck me to search the archives of OFC. Sure enough, I found this gem: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...;hl=map+symbols, and all of my questions were answered. I also recently had a successful fishing trip on Erie using Senko/O-ring/wacky rigging techniques that I learned about on this forum. I write this because I have been guilty in the past of focusing on the few-and-far-between negative elements of forum life, and letting them overshadow the overwhelming abundance of fantastic things that this site provides. In other words, I’ve been a bit of a tool. Thanks again, and all the best. Jim"
