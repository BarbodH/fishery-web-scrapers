239386,Raf,2008-08-13 16:17:00,3495,"10"" jntd believer 10"" jake 10"" suick  a few boo/bucktails  a few oversize spinner baits  a topwater (ie. topraider)  all you need."
239387,Rizzo,2008-08-13 16:17:00,4754,"rapala super shadraps aren't too big, but they do troll well at high speed and easy on the arms when casting. The smaller size may mean you're attracting dinks though. I know my percentage of muskies under 35 inches is much higher than my percentage over 35 inches"
239392,MuskieWannabe,2008-08-13 16:30:00,79,"Dog River Lodge Lure Company http://www.dogriverlodge.co.nr/  I ordered a spinner on Friday from these guys and got it in the mail yesterday.  It only cost me, to buy the spinner and ship it, $23, which is a pretty good deal, and it looks awesome!  I'm also loking at the mmbaits lures.  River rat also has some awesoem ones...Caught a lot of fish on theirs already.  riverratlures.com mmbaits.com"

239394,mattyk,2008-08-13 16:38:00,2110,"I think Raf got all the good ones. Believers, Jakes, and Big Spinner baits are my favorite for trolling."

239604,Pigeontroller,2008-08-14 02:44:00,2793,Don't forget the proper release tools!!!   Someone had to say it!
239606,mepps,2008-08-14 02:49:00,1301,"I stick with a Jake for trolling and a spinnerbait for casting. A number of people on this site make musky lures, including myself!"
239722,GbayGiant,2008-08-14 15:04:00,1780,"If monies no issue I like wood lures much better seem to have better action, but I have a selection of plastic and wood, lots of Jake's and believers too.  I like Talonz deep threats and Legend Plows come September and don't forget your sucker quick strike rigs."
239727,jwl,2008-08-14 15:55:00,1056,"a few things like this come in handy for trolling...,also don't overlook some of the oversized soft plastics, like Storm Swimbaits"
