239437,PatrickGG,2008-08-13 18:01:00,562,"A question about the new Curados, When are they gonna start selling them in Canada?"
239468,danbo,2008-08-13 19:49:00,2646,Cabela's has 'em now.
239476,SlowPoke,2008-08-13 19:55:00,2984,"I think I heard October from Jos at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock. He doesn't have a lot of faith in the newer Shimano lines and prefers the old Curado B (green) to the current Curado D (silver). I don't think he is anticipating anything better for the new Curado E. I tend to disagree with him regarding the B vs. D, I really like the D series but I did see his point with the new Stradic being a downgrade over the old one.  -Brian"
239481,danbo,2008-08-13 20:02:00,2646,"The new ""E"" has plastic side-caps!  NO thanx!   http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/descpageRLCSHIMANO-SCER.html"
239524,Fang,2008-08-13 22:48:00,1330,anticipation can only drive the price up more.  I'm a big fan of original Curados but for the $ now there's a ton of reels just as good if not better  If I had a dollar for every time I recommend the BPS Extreme I'd be a rich man. I have 5 of them now and paid $69 CDN every time they went on sale. I'm not fishing tournaments any more so the abuse level is down but they have perfromed very well for me.
239528,PatrickGG,2008-08-13 22:59:00,562,I see it's not available in the 1 series yet so i guess i am going to have to wait a little longer.
239550,mbac31,2008-08-14 00:00:00,904,September or October here I think. Awesome reels
