239323,PatrickGG,2008-08-13 13:42:00,562,"Got out on the BOG with Jeff ""Cpuguy"" , the lake looked a lot more different from last year i guess from all the rain this summer the water levels are really high and made it a day of unpredictable fishing, we got on the lake around 6:30 AM and started casting some shorelines and i get my first Musky of the year not a monster but i was really happy since there is days i cast musky lures and get nothing but just a regular spinner bait looking for bass and along comes a musky  Shortly after Jeff hits a largie on the same shoreline  Through out the day fishing was tough, we traveled the lake hitting lily pads which looked prime but held no fish at all, after a couple of hours with out a fish Jeff finally hooks into a decent smallie  after that we went about another hour with no fish at this point i was getting a little frustrated for i wanted to end the day with one bass so we moved around again and jeff hits off a couple of more   and out of no where Jeff gets a big hit and hes getting all excited ""Its a Musky"" ye yells and what a fight this fish launches out of the water 3 times before landing her and what a nice fish  At the end of the day i finally hook into a couple of largies, i got a pic of one and the other my camera pooped out on me so i think my camera is done in the garbage it goes and off to the mall in search of a new one, this has happened before and i lost some quality photos so i dont want to take anymore chances, heres the one bass i caught  "

Don't know why there aren't more smallies in Scugog. The east side looks like it can sustain a good population. Anyways, thanks for sharing."
