239777,bushart,2008-08-14 19:50:00,2628,Well I was looking at my join up date and a year is fast approaching---and being a message board rookie I have learned much in my short time here at OFC.  Now being an artist I believe I may have a strange angle to my view on things---everyone grab a grain of salt and I'll share my learnings...  1. Our friend from Hog Swaller is quick boy--he comes up with beauts I wish I thought of...Scientology--man I gotta start writing these down.  2. I think I have to stop using marshmallows for bait.  3. It quite possibly could be easier to ask a steelheader to (cough) date his wife than give up a river that currently is going.  4. I believe it is currently before the Senate to have the words DOCKS & BASS removed from the english Language.  5. Salmon identification is not for the faint of heart.  6. Console boats are made for fisherman who are still honing their craft till they can graduate to a tiller.  7. Finally if Anyone needs info on subjects from the end of the world to STD's somebody here has a link.  I'm sure I've missed lots but these seem to stay in my memory....Peace  Bushart
