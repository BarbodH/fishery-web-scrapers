238995,tonyb,2008-08-12 14:19:00,1637,"The Tragically Hip sang it best  It's been a long time running. It's been a long time coming.. It's been a long, long, long time running... It's well worth the wait  The plan to own a fishing boat that my wife and I will be able to enjoy for decades has been 5 years in the making and this dream is now becoming a reality  Here's a quick look at the latest addition to the family!        She's got a few rigging issues that are being worked out while we continue to finish the interior of the garage in time for her arrival within 2 weeks!  Tony"

239086,tonyb,2008-08-12 19:19:00,1637,"So many reasons...but some off the top of my head beyond the quality and durability of a riveted aluminum hull...  It's a very stable platform that will allow me to fish for any species of fish using a wide variety of techniques and not be limited to small water as a large portion of my fishing will be out on the Great lakes, Simcoe, etc..  I can do it all out of this boat...  Trolling in all forms (Downrigging, Planer boards, dipsy divers) Drift fishing rivers Casting for bass or musky Dragging baits for walleye or bass with drift socks Night fishing for variety of species Inclement weather fishing, under the top set and full windshield (even a propane heater if it got that cold!)  I can also use it as a scuba diving platform, tubing or waterskiing, fireworks cruises in the summer, etc, etc, etc  The size also allows me to have more anglers on board, especially when trolling when it helps to run more rods.  Man I'm pumped!"
