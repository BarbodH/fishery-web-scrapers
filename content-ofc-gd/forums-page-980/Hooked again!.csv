Now when I came out here I had no intention of going fishing...that is until I saw an ad for helicopter summer run steelheading 45 minutes north of the mountain and well, I got hooked again.  I aint gonna be cheap, but it is going to be the trip of a lifetime! I mean how could a die hard steelheader come out west and not fish some of the most amazing runs around?  Dont worry, I brought the camera and at 2 pm thursday afternoon im off to live the dream!  A report is to follow, keep your stick on the ice"

239146,JohnF,2008-08-12 22:49:00,3494,"Whatdaya wanna go up in a mixmaster fer? Them thar thangs is fer mixin' dough, not galivantin' off to chase fish. Serve ya right if all ya caught was a mess of nasty ole catfish - great long-whiskered ones with whiskey breath. said the same thing to a friend of mine who thinks he's purty smart fer flying up to the top of mountains to ski down. I asked him ""What's the point? Yer already safe at the bottom."" but he said ""There are only three truly great peaks in this world , and I wanna climb 'em all."" Apparently the helicopter is an efficient way of getting up above the easy parts. Using a mixmaster to fish is so technological, next thang ya know we'll be using sonar and tv - oh ..... wait. Never mind.  JF"
239155,silvio,2008-08-12 23:52:00,433,Good luck bud good choice to take the opportunity to fish those waters. I am hoping to get out that way one day. Best of luck out there tell me how true steelheads fight!!!
239164,bbog,2008-08-13 00:48:00,665,Good on you Kemper for recognizing an opportunity and taking it. A couple years ago my son was in BC and really wanted to go Halibut fishing but was griping about the cost. I reminded him that we don't have Halibut in Ontario. This past spring I didn't have to tell him anything when he seized the opportunity to fish Dorado in Fort Lauderdale.  Life's to short to be saying shoulda/coulda.... enjoy the trip and don't fall off your bike!
