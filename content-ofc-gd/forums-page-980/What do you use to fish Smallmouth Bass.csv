239013,super dave,2008-08-12 15:12:00,323,Slip float with a live leech.  The only problem I find with leeches is you lose the leech after every fish.  I've been using gulp leeches lately and have had pretty good success with them.  Plus they stay on the hook.
239066,BillM,2008-08-12 18:27:00,17367,"Topwater has to be my fav, Zara Spook Jr's and PopR's...  Cranks and livebait also work well (leeches, minnows and worms)"
239067,tdotfisherman,2008-08-12 18:28:00,317,"My goodness, what DON'T I use to catch Smallmouth Bass.. I've used so many different lures and baits... From a hook and a live worm from back in the day, to top-water, crankbaits, jerkbaits, jigs, artificial plastics, and so on..  Currently, I'd say my favourite technique to catch Smallies would be a jig, and a Gulp Minnow, on very light fireline, on a medium-light setup..  Smallmouth are fantastic fighters, I prefer them over Largemouth Bass tenfold.. God bless this province we live in!"
239106,Reef Runner,2008-08-12 20:38:00,980, Thanks gone fishin! Next time out I'll hunt for some crawdads
239113,rickster,2008-08-12 21:05:00,495," Can't agree more The last couple weekend the smallies have been just smashing my skitter pops I fished one piece of shoreline where the smallies had the minnow up against the shoreline and they were just boiling out of the water after them. I have never seen it like that before it was awesome Caught about 15 or so in about two hours. One about 20 1/2"" and six that were 19-19 1/2"""
239145,ehg,2008-08-12 22:47:00,2666,Fishing Kawartha lakes mostly i'd make a similar list. 1. Topwaters- caught the most and biggest fish. 2. Spinnerbaits 3. Tubes- for deeper presentation 4. Grubs- usually smoke or pumpkinseed  When all these fail a blk/silver original rapala or x-rap are the choice.  ehg
239148,Guest buick14,2008-08-12 22:55:00,0,silver size 3 mepps aglia spinners trolled fairly quickly when its windy around islands has produced the most numbers for me next to drifting live bait
239357,Mike Pike,2008-08-13 14:46:00,1332,"All of 'em!  And yes, I have a very heavy fishing vest!"
239365,mattyk,2008-08-13 15:13:00,2110,"I like tubes, and jerkbaits for smallies. Depends on the conditions. Live bait is also great for smallies."
237959,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-09 02:52:00,0,Which one?
237963,forrest,2008-08-09 03:08:00,1032,just about all of them?
237965,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-09 03:15:00,0,"I have always had hard time to decide what goes into my chest pack ...  Therefore, I would like to know what you guys prefer the most .."
237968,Cudz,2008-08-09 03:23:00,2652,I used to fish tubes all the time but now I have moved more toward senkos and I almost always drop shot various soft bait.
237992,Greencoachdog,2008-08-09 04:58:00,8163,"I like to use one of those ""hook thingies""!!!"
237995,Baldy,2008-08-09 05:57:00,44,I only use woolly buggers & Clouser minnows.
238003,Mike the Pike,2008-08-09 10:45:00,3421,"Tubes ,spinner baits ,moss boss,rapala x-raps and always bring some mepps."
238005,modny,2008-08-09 10:46:00,502,i prefer noodling for them on rock shoals and sandy flatts
238015,brickNblock,2008-08-09 11:42:00,598,weedless flippin jig w/creature or just a plain ole blown-up crawler on an Owner hook 3/0.
238017,Rich,2008-08-09 12:06:00,3927,Whatever the conditions call for..
238018,Rich Clemens,2008-08-09 12:16:00,3131,"Kinda depends on the water and structure for me.  When I'm fishing heavy weed cover, drifting over weed-beds, I use a Florida-rigged 6"" worm. Nice and weedless finding those little pockets.    For rocky bottoms, I either use cranks or tubes.   My neighbor got me started trying tubes this year and I've had some luck with them."
238031,lunkerbasshunter,2008-08-09 12:52:00,2585,i change it up.  what ever the fish are biting on.  sometimes it cna take me half a day to figure out how to get a bite.  Cheers!
238049,Leecher,2008-08-09 14:09:00,7832,"I always start the hunt with a white BigO..... Love catching them on crank bait  Second choice is Gulp x400 7"" minnow worm cherry seed on a #2 wide gap hook.  Usually will switch back and forth between the two.....had lots of success with these two methods Leechman"
238068,Jigger,2008-08-09 15:22:00,1237,"I can't count how many smallies have broken spinnerbaits on me. After that, topwaters, jerkbaits, tubes, senkos, and grubs. Barring any of those,I'll rig a 7"" Power worm with about 2"" taken off the top on a 1/4oz jighead. Alot of the fish take this on the fall, also works great drifting this set-up for deeper fish that won't take a tube being dragged but like to see it close to bottom."

238083,Leecher,2008-08-09 15:59:00,7832,Forgot to mention live leech.....SMB truly go nuts on them Leechman
238113,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-08-09 19:44:00,0,"Wow, thanks for all the inputs!  I started using stuff other live leeches this year and have had quite a bit success on throwing senko with free-falling style. It is very cool and I love it.  As far as the tub goes ... havent had any success ... not sure if I use it incorrectly or not, perhaps some of you can help.  I usually go 3/0 wide gap weedless rig the tub .. then either drag it along the rocky bottom or yank it, let it fall and yank it and let it fall ..  the place I fish SMB is mostly rocky bottom with some weeds ..  any suggestions?"
238152,Rich,2008-08-09 22:16:00,3927,"I find tubes for smallies are best rigged in the original fashion. Jighead inside not weedless. If you learn to work it you'll find weeds aren't too much of a problem unless you're fishing really, really thick stuff. I like a chiclet style head, gives more of a slow nosedive action rather than a spinning action.. though sometimes the spinning works best. Let the fish decide."
238181,NDangler,2008-08-10 00:52:00,6,"At least for me, it's hard to go wrong with a rebel wee crawdad"
238194,Fang,2008-08-10 01:32:00,1330,"Always have 4 rods rigged  Top water prop bait Senko rod 3""-4"" Xrap Tube bait  Can always rig up more but these four set ups get the most work"
238196,Rizzo,2008-08-10 01:35:00,4754,"live leech, no weight. Just toss him out over the shoal or at targeted structure and hold on. sometimes I will add a bobber to the line simply to be able to cast further."
238226,gone_fishin,2008-08-10 05:35:00,481,don't think anyone's said it yet...  the smallmouth's favourite food...  LIVE CRAYFISH!!!
238719,Reef Runner,2008-08-11 19:51:00,980,"  Tubes, white with silver flake.  I always wanted to try crayfish, how do you rig it up? what's the best size?"
238838,Garyv,2008-08-12 00:44:00,547,"Guess after reading the above answers I'm in the minority.  When drift fishing , which is my favorite way to fish smallmouth, I like live bait....crayfish, minnows and worms probably because I've use them all my life and have tremendous confidence in them.  I do use small spinners and very small spoons as well as work harnesses when trolling."
238937,gone_fishin,2008-08-12 06:52:00,481," i've caught smallies of all sizes on crayfish ranging from little one inchers, to ""mini-lobster"" 4 inchers. hook them through the tail through the underside and up through the shell, make sure you don't puncture the veign in the center of the tail... the crayfish will die in less than 5 minutes if you do!"
