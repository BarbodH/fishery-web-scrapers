239200,Smitty1,2008-08-13 02:32:00,29,Hey Guys  My buddies wife gave me a call tonight - she wants to get him a fish finder for his b-day - and asked me for a recommendation - she said it does not have to be colour - since he is colour blind - price range is about $150-$200. I really like the customer service with Lowrance...but I would like some suggestions - we usually fish small lakes and rivers - some trolling - I know he mentioned he wanted something that shows baitfish with maybe temp and speed.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  thanks Smitty

If he's colour blind theres not much wrong with the GreyScale finders.........I actually like them quite a bit. Not Eagle ..but Ive a greyScale mounted on the bow of my boat and its a decent read. Have your buddies wife check out ... www.lowrance.com ...you'll find them there as well the features that accompany them. .if she can.....suggest opting for a dual frequency cone for more coverage."
