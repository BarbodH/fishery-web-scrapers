239728,Dutch,2008-08-14 15:56:00,831,"I like the set-up of the Tracker Tournament V-18 - large, high front casting deck, bench seating, high back casting deck.  But, I want to keep my options open.  Does anyone know of any other boat makers that have somewhat of a ""V"" shaped aluminum like this?  I'm not a big fan of the modified ""V"" hulls (pretty much a rectangle like front casting deck), like bass tracker and triton boats have.  I want to keep my options open as I look at new and used boats.  Basically looking for something with a bassboat set-up, but that is rivited aluminum.  "
239731,cranks bait,2008-08-14 16:20:00,721,"A lot of manufactures have this type of boat.  Lowe, Polor Craft are two off the top of my head.  I have a Lowe right now (in the classifides).  They are awsome for the amount of deck space that you have.   Makes for a great pitching and flipping boat.  No walls to hit.  As for the hull mine is a modified jon boat.  I'm guessing that's what most of them will be."
239738,edmichit,2008-08-14 16:44:00,145,"i bought my crestliner CV182 tourney for that exact reason. Plenty of high casting area, and aluminum hull.  not riveted but welded hull."
239740,Another Canadian,2008-08-14 16:52:00,41,"Hi Dutch,  Does something like this help you in your search? http://www.xpressboats.com It apears to be welded construction, but it is aluminum.  Looks like their are two dealers in Ontario. http://www.xpressboats.com/locations.php/mode/list  At another site I frequent, a fellow there has one.  AC"
