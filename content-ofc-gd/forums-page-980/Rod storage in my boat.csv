239829,glen,2008-08-14 23:16:00,2641,When i am out fishing it would be nice to have a place to put the rods when moving from one spot to the next.  I fish from the back and i just lean my rods on the floor and up over the rear casting deck.  The front is more of a problem cause there is less space. I tried the vertical tube holders but they can get in the way.  I am thinking of putting some padding in one of the corners so the rods can be propped up there.  If there is a good answer to this problem i would like to hear it.  Thanks for any help.       
239833,johnnyb,2008-08-14 23:20:00,3413,they won't sit between the middle passenger seat and the wall?
239834,glen,2008-08-14 23:23:00,2641,The seat box is in the way Johnny.  But it would really open the boat up if i put the passenger seat on a pedestal.  I am going to try the rods there now.
239837,johnnyb,2008-08-14 23:26:00,3413,"If you did that, would it not also free up the space along that whole wall of the boat?  Enough to mount some of those horizontal rod holders, meant for the wall of your house/garage?  Then you could have them all stuck to the side, stacked on top of each other, and be all slick lookin'"
239841,glen,2008-08-14 23:34:00,2641,That may be the answer.  I am still thinking though.
239856,forrest,2008-08-15 00:16:00,1032,Berkly horizonal rod holders.  4 rods = $10 and 6 rods=$11 at Lebarons (actually the 4 rod set works out for 8 rods for me).  My boat is different than yours but maybe you can adapt.......I based my setup on this site: http://www.correllconcepts.com/boat_conversion.htm   forrest
