238492,Jen,2008-08-11 01:17:00,833,"It was a wonderful day on the water... Steve's Mom and Bob hadn't been out fishing in years and truly enjoyed the entire experience.  Thank goodness the fish co operated and everyone got to catch something.  There isn't a lot of time during the summer months for pleasure fishing with all the charters ... thanks Steve for getting us all out!  It was a great time!  Cheers,  Jen"

We had winning boxes of fish all weekend during the 444 but did not enter ...but you can't do both charter and tourneys ...  If anyone on this site needs help catching  Lake Erie Walleye I will do my best to help you out ...  Time for bed now, 12 hours on the pond today and another 8 tomorrow  .."
