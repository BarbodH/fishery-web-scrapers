For those of you that want to do some high-quality salmon fishing over the Labor Day weekend, the Fall Salmon Tournament is exactly what you’re looking for. We’re getting our teams together now for the tournament, on the August 29th-31st weekend, and as an added bonus to everything, the Main Event prize money for first place is a cool $25,000. With over $60,000 being offered in prizes for the tournament, every day has its payouts and rewards for catching the big one.
