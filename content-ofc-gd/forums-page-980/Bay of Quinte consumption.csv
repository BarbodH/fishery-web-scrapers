238686,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-11 17:32:00,0,I kept two pickerel from BOQ. How many people here eat pickerel from Bay of Quinte?
238687,cranks bait,2008-08-11 17:33:00,721,I grew up on BOQ fish and I'm still here.
238701,ccmtcanada,2008-08-11 18:23:00,7971,"The guide to eating sportfish says that if you are a healthy adult, you can have 8 meals of walleye per month if the fish is 26"" or under.  It goes down to 4 meals from 26 to 28 "" and then only 2 for fish 30+ inches."
238707,ketchenany,2008-08-11 18:26:00,3229,I see Cliff is reading the book!  :clapping:
238709,ccmtcanada,2008-08-11 18:28:00,7971, LOL...whoever wrote and edited that manual should get a raise...nice and easy to read....
238723,leighfns,2008-08-11 19:57:00,103,i am moving to a place on the BOQ come Sept...   Is the water quality there worse than other inland lakes?  I really hope it is not too bad
238724,danbo,2008-08-11 20:01:00,2646,I just cut-off the cancerous growths & then you're Good-to-go!!   http://www.walleyecentral.com/articles/?a=646
238726,Grimace,2008-08-11 20:19:00,2020,Nothing wrong with them.   I had some last night.
238996,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-12 14:22:00,0,Thanks.We have a great lake full of fish and it sucks I have to ask a question like that. I wonder how many more factories are polluting lake Ontario? And if anything can be done about the mercury levels and other toxins?  What happened to that billion dollar clean up we were hearing about and reviving Lake Ontario's beaches?
239024,Dabluz,2008-08-12 15:42:00,701,You should have seen Lake Ontario 30 or 40 years ago.  Floating alewives were everywhere and they would form large drifts on the shore every year.
239076,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-12 18:58:00,0," And you should have seen Lake Ontario 100 years ago, when we had a thriving beach.  After getting a lot of warnings to not eat the fish,  I think I will feed them to the cats....."
239080,johnnyb,2008-08-12 19:02:00,3413,"well, as long as someone eats them...I mean to just catch 'em, kill 'em, then not enjoy them would be terrible.  Or illegal....so...here kitty kitty..."
239121,Dabluz,2008-08-12 21:25:00,701,I think you will find that the walleye are better tasting than the pickeral.
239265,Rich,2008-08-13 11:14:00,3927,Eating a couple of walleye out of the lake won't hurt you in any way Johnny. I've been eating great lakes fish all my life.... and so far I still have all my hair and I'm pretty sure I'm not sterile. lol
239425,duber,2008-08-13 17:37:00,220,"The bay is actually cleaner now than it has been in any of our life times.The mercury that is in the fish now was in the water years ago.Mercury is a heavy metal and never goes away.It can be dilouted or concentrated but it will always be around.So my advice to all who fish the bay and don't trust the consumption guides facts, let them all go and leave them for me"
239477,leighfns,2008-08-13 19:55:00,103,Doesn't the bay actually flow out to Lake Ontario?  Wouldn't the water quality be similar to that in the Trent and Moira Rivers?
239480,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-13 20:02:00,0, Not according to the consumption guide lines....
239591,ccmtcanada,2008-08-14 02:12:00,7971," Perhaps, but don't the walleye spend some time out in the big lake during the summer months and then come into the bay in greater numbers as the water temps cool down?"
239596,POLLIWOGG,2008-08-14 02:26:00,835,"5 or 6 thousand people die every year in Ontario from breathing the air, nobody died from eating the fish.  If your cat commits suicide let us know so we can stop eating the fish."
239611,Dondorfish,2008-08-14 03:03:00,1000,   Rich - maybe you should watch some of the video's that you posted !!!    -  LOL Only kidding Rich - have enjoyed most of them.   Don  
239621,leighfns,2008-08-14 04:45:00,103,  That's only the walleye over 5pnds....   Personally I would feel bad eating a walleye that big anyways
239626,leighfns,2008-08-14 07:40:00,103, I checked the guidelines for the Upper Bay and they are almost identical to the Trent River....  Infact in some cases they are better
239652,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-14 12:28:00,0," Thats interesting, considering that the water clarity on the Trent is amazing. The meat looked nice and clean and the cat left absolutely nothing. Not even the scales or spine and its still alive, or maybe it has 8 lives left.lol......I still have the bigger one in the freezer."
