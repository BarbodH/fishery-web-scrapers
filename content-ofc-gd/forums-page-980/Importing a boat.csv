239030,Rizzo,2008-08-12 16:03:00,4754,"So I'm heading to Myrtle Beach with the family, and was wondering what it takes to import a boat from the states. Is it as simple as hooking it up and signing a few forms when you reach the border? What kind of taxes would be added? Would you get back the taxes that you paid to the state it was purchased in? If you buy privately, do you have to register the boat in that state or can you just show up at the border with a ""bill of sale"" that buddy has written out for you? Any advice would be appreciated."
239046,ccmtcanada,2008-08-12 16:25:00,7971,Check out the FAQ section above....there's a link in there about this subject I believe.
239058,mikeh,2008-08-12 17:17:00,824,"I have bought a boat in the states before and they asked to see the ad from the magazine , I don't think it is required by law but the more info you can show them you are not scamming the better."
239074,Rizzo,2008-08-12 18:57:00,4754,"thanks, I've found the info...now to decide if its worth it!"
239084,John,2008-08-12 19:07:00,2956,"Rizzo, definitely worth it if you find the right one for you. Do your due diligence and it's a simple process."
239098,workwear,2008-08-12 19:51:00,592,the only thing i might ad is.....bring a paper trail down with you....and dont lie.......customs has a way of finding things out....heard of a few horrow storys regarding customs....second thing if your buyin used.....contact a local marina and get it checked out!!!...compression tests and a leak down test....  also you may want to take into consideration of how to pay for it...their banks dont reconized our banks....and with out acc't numbers being exchanged very hard to wire money.....you can pay it thru pay pal...but that 2 points.....could be alot of money if your talkin big bucks.....if you bring cash....remember legally only 9999.00 is allowed over the border with out declaring it....make sure you have all the angles covered...  at customs here in canada youll pay for the gst on the whole purchase and pst on the boat only.....time of regersting the trailer here they will ding you the pst  too bad you waited this long as our dollar is takin a beating i think its round 93 cents.....  all in all good luck.....
239102,John,2008-08-12 20:12:00,2956, Good points..... US banks do recognise CDN banks if you have all of the appropriate info to give them.
239126,magicfingers,2008-08-12 21:51:00,37,"I carried $23,000.00 US across to pick up my bass boat with no problems you just have to let them know you have it and what its for.Alittle bit of paper work buy no real problem.Piece of cake importing a boat if you ask me. magic"
239154,forrest,2008-08-12 23:51:00,1032,"The MTO people are a real pain in the butt so know when they are supposed to do before going.  Get the trailer and boat on seperate bills.  Do the RIV stuff online it will be quicker.  Check out RIV.ca  Canadian compliance label is no longer required.  But, the feds say you should ask the boat manufacturer for one.  forrest"
239297,BillM,2008-08-13 12:24:00,17367,"Yup, definitely check out the RIV site for all the required documents..  My dad bought a '07 2500HD Duramax down in Florida when we were vacationing..  Was a pretty simple process to bring it back across the boarder and getting it registered here in Ontario."
