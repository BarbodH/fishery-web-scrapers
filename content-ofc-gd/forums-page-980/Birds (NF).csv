Sorry for the fuzzy pics, but I had to act fast and not scare it and its through the front window on zoom.        Thanks  Joey"

239429,Joey,2008-08-13 17:51:00,9122,"Baltimore Oriole, isn't it a little far from home  Thanks guys, looks like you're right.  I don't recall ever seeing one before.  It was beautiful.  Joey"

239433,ccmtcanada,2008-08-13 17:53:00,7971,"I'd say the Blue Jays would come and beat on them, but hey, that's just not gonna happen now is it???"
239434,JohnF,2008-08-13 17:54:00,3494, Yup.  JF
239435,JohnF,2008-08-13 17:57:00,3494,Audubon says they range as far north as the top of the Great lakes in summer.  JF

239556,Tie Twist,2008-08-14 00:13:00,10,"Definately a Balt Oriole. For any other Bird Nerds out there, here is a great site for IDing birds. Use the bottom of the page (attributes) to narrow down the attributes that you know, one at a time. Works well.  http://identify.whatbird.com/mwg/_/0/attrs.aspx   Great resource for IDing bird voices too."
239588,Domi Fish,2008-08-14 02:08:00,46,It's a Yellow Shafted Flicker..
239598,gdelongchamp,2008-08-14 02:32:00,199,It's a Baltimore Oriole as per page 259 of my Roger Tory Peterson field guide. Very good you bird watchers.

239665,Mike Pike,2008-08-14 12:49:00,1332,"Very cool bird, eh Joey!  I don't see 'em very often here around Hamilton but every now and then one flies through.  I work in Waterloo and will see one every so often on my drive from Hamilton to Waterloo, particularly in the rural areas.  Now, I thought they changed the common name of the Baltimore Oriole to Northern Oriole.  Nice bird either way."
