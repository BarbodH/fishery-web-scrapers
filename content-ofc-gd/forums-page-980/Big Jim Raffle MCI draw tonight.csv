By the way saw Jim the other day sporting a new truck, looks good.  First comment my wife made was ""hey you have that same reel"", then I got a funny look.  The kind of, ""how much did it cost you look"" .  Not good when you have the same as the logo on the pro vehicle, easier to get away with when it just said Shimano."
