We've been to the island on numerous occasions, but only done the tourist charters for Mackerel/the odd Cod. This time we're looking to branch out and wondering if any one has experience out there.  Names of day/halfday charters that you'd recommend would also be of great help! We usually just pick one when we get there. Hoping one of you has had a great time on a boat and would like to recommend the captain?!  General tips welcome as well... newbie east coast fishing should be a good time! Can't wait!  Moose"
238438,Musky or Specks,2008-08-10 22:50:00,2710,Go to Bonshaw Provincial Park. Its polluted with small brookies and you can catch the odd big one downstream of the HWY 17 culvert. I had a great time fishing it while I was there for the day  http://www.gov.pe.ca/visitorsguide/index.php3?number=1009918  Another link that will get you a little bit more excited  http://hipwader.com/2003/pei-trout-fly-fishing
238529,scuro,2008-08-11 04:32:00,386,I'm thinking Mackerel might be in. You don't need a license to fish the ocean. Get some little Cleos 3/4 ounce and toss them off a peer. Lots of fun...catch dinner every night in 1/2 an hour.
238533,douG,2008-08-11 04:57:00,2693,"Very true, scuro.  Fresh mackerel is very fine eating.  Floured then fried, a little lemon or green tomato pickle.  I even caught  a few cod off Sambro pier.  If there are mackerel running, you will have a blast.  Show up around dusk and look for locals.  As for charters, I spent many vacations as a chile in North Rustico, and recommend that place.  In fact, I just came back.  When you stop there, look at the RW grocery store and pick up whatever fresh baking you see .  My aunt makes it every day, not to be missed, esp the meat pies on Thursday.  Just tell her who sent you."
239559,mooseroo,2008-08-14 00:27:00,80,Thanks for the great suggestions! Definitely going to try a couple of piers with Cleo's.  I'll pop the grocery and buy some baked goods and say hello to your aunt for you!  Moose
