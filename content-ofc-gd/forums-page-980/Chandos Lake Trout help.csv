I'm going camping on Chandos Lake this upcoming weekend and I was wondering if anyone could steer me in the right direction as far as where I should be targetting Lakers right now and what lures should I use?  Thanks, and ill let you know how I do!"
239065,douG,2008-08-12 17:57:00,2693,"I assume that you have a depthfinder that can show bait and trout.  Fish there, or at least at that depth, likely around 30 - 35 feet.  Remember that your depth at the ball will be less than the number on the reel counter, usually about 80 - 85%, due to the forward motion of your boat and drag on the ball.  Try body baits like husky jerks or original Raps, and spoons like williams wablers or lil cleos in natural colours.  Good Luck!"
