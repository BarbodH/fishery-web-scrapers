239682,snag,2008-08-14 13:23:00,1932,"Look, just get to the point.  I will rule the planet some day.  So bow to me.   I can be merciful.  My real name is ZONTAR.  I have a cabbage leaf growing out of the back of my head.   My food is Paranoid Propaganda,  and I'm being overfed here.   (note to self: stick to fishing threads)   ."
239698,Guest lundboy,2008-08-14 13:54:00,0," Hmmm...  Think about what you just said, and apply it to the proof, evidence and documentation you see for promoting climate change.  Are you so sure that you aren't being taken for a ride?  There's plenty of visual evidence right now that what I have provided documentation to is taking place.  That link http://www.green-agenda.com has evidence in there that shows how polar regions have been melting and how it has been since the last ""mini ice age"", and how the water levels on some key ancient architecture at sea level around the world has not shown any change in water marks.  So I guess we have to agree to disagree on these issues.  I will leave you with one last article, which I'm sure you will view as rhetoric, and falsehoods, because once one has worshiped at the alter of Climate ChangeTM , one has a hard time switching religions.   http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story...17-7583,00.html"
239703,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-14 14:17:00,0,"So basically, you are saying you want to start limiting the amount of Children, people are having? Good luck with that. Especially in the west.  Cats are extinct? Then what animal have I been feeding in the backyard all this time?  Actually it is getting harder for many couples to conceive.  Again. How do you propose to reduce the population any time soon, other than war or plague?  Fantasy? I think not. Space travel is becoming more and more advanced as each day passes. With the advancements of nuclear power and alternative energies, it may very well be reality in 30-50 years. Who knows. All it takes is one little break through and watch technology take off. Just like when they invented the micro chip. Look what has happened in the last 30 years.  Limited cultivators?If need be they can add soil and other soiless applications. So it is not fantasy.They are already working on this thing that you call fantasy.  You think apartment buildings are ugly, but what does that have to do with anything? Look at some of the world's most heavily populated cities. They are full of apartment buildings. Why? Limited space.  And I don't know what you are trying to prove with all that population data. That there were fewer people in the past? That goes without saying.  This entire discussion IMO is ridiculous and fantasy. Since there is no reasonable way of reducing the earth's population, anywhere in the near future, without war or plague or devastating natural disaster.  Or if they start putting restrictions on baby births which will not happen anytime soon. What they have done is make it more expensive to raise a child, thus people are having less children. Or at least putting it off.  I think more time should be put on finding practical ways to deal with the problems(of an increasing population) and not fantasy.  So although you think it would be a better place if there was 1-2 million per continent? It is easier said than done."
239706,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-14 14:28:00,0," Are you sure you are not being taken for a ride by the powers that be?  Polar regions have been melting on and off. What has changed now is the rate of thaw. There is a clear visual indication that water levels are up. If the water levels went up even by a 1/4 of an inch, the result would be increased rainfall and heavy flooding. Hmmmmm. Has there been increased rainfall and heavy flooding? The answer is yes.  Therefore, logic is on my side.  Are you telling me the PTB are causing it? They are causing the floods, the rainfall, the hurricanes and the earthquakes and the upswing in tornadoes and the huge hail storms we have been having and the eradic behaviour of sea life and the early blooming of plants?  Lets get serious now. All you have is words on a site. My evidence I presented cannot be denied by anyone that has eyes and ears.  Honestly, due to the limited time and the amount of mis-information on the net?I don't have time to read it, but if it is saying that global warming is fantasy and that it is being promoted by the elites? I will not buy it. Have they actually worked that angle before to cause fear? More than likely, but now I believe it is really happening. Either way, something must be done to curb pollution of our air we breathe and our waters we drink."
239748,Guest lundboy,2008-08-14 17:33:00,0," Since you haven't read the site, you are assuming that it says Climate ChangeTM is a fantasy, when in fact it is not, as I stated to you earlier.  It is merely saying that the problem has been hijacked by the global elite to subdue the population, justify taxing, and to reduce the population by 90%, and that the plan was initiated a long time ago.  Seriously, unless you are with greenpeace (or replace with your favourite eco warrior faction) and travel around the world to see the evidence first hand, all you have is words on a site or from talking heads on PBS and news channels as well.  If you are unwilling to look further at what the PTB ARE capable of and HAVE been doing for some time, then you will no doubt go to the grave with the opinions you have been led to, as will I.  Remember when you have uinlimited money you can do ANYTHING you put your mind to.  Everything the elite do is to accomplish ""the great work"" which was laid out 100+ years ago.  Including using weather as a weapon.  Weather manipulation is not a secret.  There are documented international treaties (UN based docs, are aparently misinfo according to you) that explain what each country can and can't (shouldn't) do to each other.   All you have to do is look up at the crisscross patterns in the sky on any given clear day (that old eyes to see, ears to hear theory).  Case in point China right now, have manipulated the weather for the Olympics.  I won't give you anymore links, because your mind has been set, and you have already said you won't look at anymore evidence from the web.  It's true there is a lot of misinformation out there ON BOTH SIDES, coordinated and created as per plan.  My goal with this thread is to get people to start ""thinking"" about what is going on.  To look at other sources of world events rather than the six o'clock news and to form their own opinions, specifically that things are not as they appear.  Haven't been for long long time.  Which you have done to some extent, and I respect that.  When people won't, don't, can't read, can't reason for themselves, can't form their own opinions, are victims of the Hegelian dialectic (since the time of their birth and long before) pushed out by the mainstream media and societal eilite, any other reasoning or evidence to the contrary of their comfort zone appears to be little more than madness.  Which is what most of you think of me by now, but that's ok.  The next 2-4 years will expose the truth, so far it is ""looking"" to be from your point of view JB (because that is what we are intended to believe).  So, for everyone on this forum, I apologize for trying to shift you from your ""happy place"" and to take a serious look at the world around you from different points of view.  And maybe convince you to prepare for what will transpire in a short time period.  You can all rejoice in knowing that I will not post anymore threads related to this subject matter, nor will I chime in on any threads of similar ilk. I've provided as much info as I could in such a small venue, and there has been little interest, and downright indifference.  Not an unexpected response to the ramblings of a ""madman""."
239752,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-14 17:51:00,0," The global Elite make a lot of money polluting the earth. If they are going to loose profit, they have to generate it another way. And it isn't going to come out of their pockets.  Now would you rather pay them to poillute, or pay them to clean up our air and waters?  You tell me what actions governments take that are not added to the tax payer?  And explain to me how they are using Global warming to reduce the population by 90%? If we are going to discuss global warming? Lets try to stay on the subject.    Bull My evidence is not on a site. These are events that are happening world wide and are widely publicized. Your argument does not apply.  I know exactly how they herd the sheep and the degree of mass manipulation that is used. This has nothing to do with the discussion of Global Warming. They are not capable of making Hurricanes(it takes 2 massive fronts) or global torrential rainfall on the scale of major flooding.   Yes weather manipulation is possible, but not on the scale we have been seeing. At least not yet. So again, your argument sounds a little too far out there.   It sounds like your mind is made up also, so we are at a stalemate.  Obviously, since they play both sides of every spectrum. But i have done my homework.   With this I totally agree 200%. The one major thing we disagree on is I am pro-green. And I believe something should be done about the amount of pollution being pumped into our air and waters.   If you repeat a lie enough times, people will perceive it as the truth. This is one of their tactics in mass manipulating.  Only time will tell what the future brings and it doesn't look like the wait is going to be too long."
239754,Spiel,2008-08-14 18:06:00,9065,"....This is giving me a headache.  Lundboy perhaps you could find another site to post all this, I've got no time nor patience for your rants. Get out and go fishing before the sky falls!"
239669,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-14 13:00:00,0," You don't think there is any proof climate change will cause an economic or catastrophic disaster? It already has. How many people have been killed or affected by extreme weather? And who do you think pays for all the damage?  Can you imagine for example, if tornadoes start to increase in numbers and strength?  There is no food shortage. The rich have taken hits on their loans (of money of which is not even theirs) and guess who has to pay the bills? We do, thanks to inflation.  If farmers are producing Ethanol instead of food? Where is all this Ethanol? This is all a bunch of Bull if you ask me.  If the arctic continues to melt, water levels will rise and floods and heavy downpour will occur. I think the Eskimos would care. Every animal plays a part with the earth's eco-system. Sure the eco-system would eventually adapt, but it could change a lot affecting some people's lively hood."
239671,snag,2008-08-14 13:03:00,1932,"You can see the following here with charts: Population Growth  Do a search on Population Growth Charts and it'll give you an idea of where I'm coming from.  1830 the world’s population was One billion.    POPULATION GROWTH   HISTORICAL GROWTH IN WORLD’S POPULATION    Ÿ         1830 the world’s population was One billion.  Ÿ         1930 just 100 years later, the population reached 2 billion.  Ÿ         1960 30 years later world’s population reached 3 billion  Ÿ         15 more years later in 1975, it climbed to 4 billion.

Ÿ         In 1998 11 years later the world’s population reached 6 billion  Ÿ         By 2029, the world’s population would be about 10.4 billion    DISTRIBUTION OF WORLD’S POPULATION    1.    East Asia:  Approximately 1/4 of the world's population lives in East Asia, including Eastern parts of China, Japan, the Korean Peninsula and the island of Taiwan.    2.    South Asia: The second largest concentration is in South Asia region where more that 20% of world’s population resides. It comprises India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. India is the world's second most populous country.    3.    South East Asia: Nearly 500 million people live in this region comprising series of islands located between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They include the Philippines and Indonesia (which is made up of 13,677 islands). More than 100 million people live on the island of Java (Indonesia).    4.    Europe:  The world's third largest population cluster comprises about two dozen countries that make up much of Europe. Approximately 15% of the world's people live in this cluster.    5.    North America:  The largest concentration of people in the Western Hemisphere is in the Northeastern United States and South Eastern Canada. Approximately 150 million people live in this region.    SPARSELY POPULATED REGIONS:    1.   Desert Regions: the largest desert is Sahara. Others are the Arabian, Atacama, and Gobi deserts. The largest desert region in the Southern Hemisphere is found in Australia.    2.   Very Hot and Wet Tropical Rain forests such as the Congo forest in Africa and the Amazon forest in Brazil, South America.    3.   Very Cold lands such as Northern Canada, Greenland, Siberia and Antarctica.    DISPARITIES IN FERTILITY RATES AMONG NATIONS    Fertility refers to the average number of children every woman in a population can have during her reproductive years (15 - 49 years). Some reasons for the disparity include:    1. The use of children as economic assets by some groups.    2. Lack of financial security during old age may cause couples to have more children who may take care of them in old age    3. Lack of educational opportunities for women.    4. Lack of Employment opportunities.    5. The status of women in society (as domestic workers or part of the general work force).    6. Religious Beliefs (e.g. abstinence and one wife policy by Catholics, and more wives for Muslims).    7. Availability of Family Planning Services    8. Legalized abortions    9. A high infant mortality may compel married couples to have more children so some can live.    POPULATION DYNAMICS:    Changes in the population of a country are caused by:    1.                      Births (fertility)  2.                      Deaths (mortality) and…  3.                      Migration (movement of people among nations).    Natural increase refers to changes that are caused by changes in births and deaths only. The number of persons born per 1,000 individuals in a given year is the Crude Birth Rate. The number of persons per 1000 individuals who die in a particular year is the Crude Death Rate.    POPULATION PYRAMID    Population pyramid is an age structure of a country’s population that shows percentages of the total population in five-year age groups.  The pyramid reveals several characteristics about a country’s population. They include population growth, sex structure, working force, number of dependents and a record of historical events that led to high births or great loss of lives.    The shape of a pyramid indicates the relative growth of the population. There are three main shapes:    1.           Rapidly growing population: Broad-based because a large percentage of the population is usually less than 14 years old. Many African, Asian and Latin American countries have broad-based pyramids. More than 40% of their populations are under age 15.    2.           Stable population: A pyramids with proportional sides – almost equal base, mid-section and top. Countries with stable populations include France, Scandinavian countries and Canada.    3.            Declining population: A pyramid with very narrow base. Few children are born. Examples of countries with declining populations are Austria, Germany (East and West), Hungary and Japan.      DECLINING POPULATION - ITALY      RAPIDLY GROWING POPULATION - JAMAICA      DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION THEORY   Demographic transition refers to changes in population that occurs because of industrial growth when a country moves from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. There are 4 stages involved:    Stage 1 - Pre-Industrial Stage:  A country experiences high birth rates and high death rates. Death rates sometimes fluctuate.    Stage II – Early Industrial Stage:  High birth rates and high death rates are experienced. A small fall in death rates because of improving economic and social conditions.    Stage III – Industrial Stage:  Low death rates and Low birth rates. Education and job opportunities cause a reduction in birth rates while improved medical facilities cause a decline in death rate.    Stage IV – Post Industrial Stage:  There is a zero population growth. Low death rates and fluctuating birth rates are experienced.    Why Cant Developing Countries today take advantage of the Demographic Transition    1.  Lack of trained personnel for industrial development.    2.  Lack of an essential energy base    3.  Rapid population growth and poverty    4.  Lack of financial resources.    ADDRESSING THE POPULATION PROBLEM    Indirect Methods:    a.  Increasing food production  b.  Food Aid.  c.  Economic Development.  d.  Mass Education of children    Direct Methods:    a.  Planned Parenthood and Family Planning Services  b.  Abortion  c.  Abstinence"
