239331,Bitsmith2k,2008-08-13 14:05:00,396," well you cant go wrong, a week up there and drinking the nectar..  nice report dude.."
239332,addy79,2008-08-13 14:06:00,573,look like heaven to me...   do you guys drive all the way up? how long did it take?
239334,corvette1,2008-08-13 14:14:00,1765,great trip nice eyes and pike awsome
239336,snag,2008-08-13 14:16:00,1932,Brilliant as always!  Dirty filthy pike!  My inlaws had a couple foxes that became very friendly. The are cute until children become an issue.  Thanks dude
239348,ehg,2008-08-13 14:27:00,2666,"Great report! The photography is fantastic. Too bad about the pike discrimination that one is huge.  That fox is cuter than most of the dogs in parks around here.  Thanks for posting, ehg"
239361,LeXXington,2008-08-13 14:54:00,1928,TAKE ME .... TAKE ME ....  Great pic's etc Sean I am going to cry in a corner now
239364,tbayboy,2008-08-13 15:01:00,1497,"The best I've done driving was 14 hours but it cost me $350 in tickets, its usually more like 18 hours.  I usually fly these days, much easier.  About the pike - GCD is right, I was scared to lift it up, well not scared but just didn't want to risk it for both my hands and the fish itself.  Usually they freak out but this one never did so I figured the second I grabbed her she would and I had already cut myself on a 2 footer.  So I figured it was best for all to just take some pics in the water and let her go at the side.  As for the pike bias, its not these big ones that we all hate up here, hell I loved catching this big girl.  Its  the billion snot rockets that drive you batty - they're everywhere and they hit anything.  Like sheephead down here only they're 18"" long give no fight and take off with your best lures.  Thanks for the comments everyone."
239374,1leggedangler,2008-08-13 15:38:00,364,"Looked liked an amazing trip!!! Can't beat 5 days fishing with boys up in some of the most beautiful parts that Canada has to offer, so jealous! Those are some of the clearest pics I've seen in a report. Thanks for taking the time to post and repost.  Cheers, 1leg"
239378,mikeh,2008-08-13 15:48:00,824,"great report Sean, awesome pictures as usual."
239389,Mike Pike,2008-08-13 16:22:00,1332,"Thanks for taking the time to post that( for a 2nd time even )for us, Sean.  A beauty trip for sure, with lots of fish and good friends.  The meals look like they would have been as spectacular as the scenery!  Cheers!"
239391,Leecher,2008-08-13 16:28:00,7832,Awesome report and pics TbayBoy  Looks like a ton of fun was had by all and the scenery is so beautiful Paradise for sure!  Thanks for sharing Leechman
239400,scuro,2008-08-13 16:44:00,386," I LOVE that Northern Ontario bias...keep it going   :w00t:  Who wants to catch walleye where the only challenge is finding them. How many times have I seen the walleye death spiral where they give up the fight early in the battle and come into the boat spiral fashion. Then they get tough in the boat and flare their gills at you. You can just see it in the posture of the guys fishing walleye on the post...no battle in the foreseeable future.  Give me a snot rocket any day, at least they are aggressive and don't mouth the lure forever. And comparing a mid 40 pike to a trophy walleye...the big girls make your heart race with their power and cunning. The trophy walleye...stays a little longer on the bottom and gives you some extra head shakes. The only thing going for the walleye is the nice colouring and easy filleting."
239609,ehg,2008-08-14 02:56:00,2666," O.K i kinda get why the pike are frowned on there, seeing that 18 inchers hit everything, and there nasty little teeth will still cut you. Sounds like there akin to mosquitos. Pike are not as populous down in southern Ontario.  Great report as usual Sean.  ehg"
239198,danc,2008-08-13 02:24:00,4677,Wonderful report Sean. Good time with good friends. That's what it's all about.
239203,Joey,2008-08-13 02:39:00,9122,"Wow, those pictures are fantastic.  A very well put together report.  Thanks for sharing your adventure.  That fox is the cutest little guy.  Joey"
239204,tdotfisherman,2008-08-13 02:40:00,317,"Great quality pics there, thanks for sharing.. Although, if I was in your place I would have hoisted that big Nothern up for a few nice photos, she was a biggun.."
239209,danc,2008-08-13 02:43:00,4677," Northern Ontarians have no use for Pike. Sean, tjsa and I all argee to that fact. We'd rather not catch them than catch them."
239212,Beats,2008-08-13 02:50:00,543,That's a killer picture of that fox.  Your pics are very clear and well taken.
239214,tbayboy,2008-08-13 02:52:00,1497,"Yup, why would I want a big slimy thing flopping all over the boat, bad enough he wrecked my spinner bait .  It's funny how I forget every year how annoying those stupid fish are.  Ok the big guy wasn't annoying but the 100 others all week really started to try my patience."
239222,tdotfisherman,2008-08-13 03:13:00,317,"Okay fair enough, everyone's entitled to their opinions.. I'm not going to hijack your thread with a debate about catching Pike.. Again Tbayboy, great report!"
239236,highdrifter,2008-08-13 03:56:00,2534,OOOHHHH YAH.  Very satisfying.  yyeeeeeee!!! HD
239243,StrealHeader,2008-08-13 04:53:00,56,"Sweet! did the mods finally remove that stupid picture resizer? Pictures look sweet on the 21""."
239245,huntervasili,2008-08-13 07:53:00,1604,"Some beauty fish you caught. Looks like a great time and some fantastic scenery, thanks for sharing the experience"
239248,Greencoachdog,2008-08-13 09:57:00,8163, It looks like they were afraid of it!   Excellent report and pics!!!
239250,Whopper,2008-08-13 10:07:00,2174,Great pictures and report!  I find the bigger pike are easier to handle than the smaller ones. They will destroy some spinnerbaits though. Glad you had a good time!  Thanks for sharing!
239252,mattyk,2008-08-13 10:53:00,2110,"great report, beautiful pictures!"
239255,Rich,2008-08-13 11:05:00,3927,What an excellent report! I felt like I was right there with you guys. Sounds like an awesome time! Thank you for sharing the experience.
239257,danbouck,2008-08-13 11:06:00,4380,Great Report! I love the pics and video
239270,Victor,2008-08-13 11:21:00,1609,"A very beautiful place indeed, you took some amazing pictures too Sean!  Glad to hear that you had a great time and the weather gods seem to have cooporated with ya. Nice pike too!  Thanks for sharing!"
239272,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-13 11:32:00,0,"Great report, pics and videos. I would not take too much of those tums. They give you kidney stones!!!!  Nice Pike!! You should have hoisted it up for a picture. I like seeing big pike! I could understand if you had no net and there were a lot of treble hooks involved. But on a spinner bait it would have been no problem. Anyways, thanks for sharing."
239274,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-08-13 11:36:00,1362,Great report and pics  .....looks like you guys had a blast!!....I sure wish that we could get 5 days in a row here without torrential rain!!!....You had beauty weather conditions!!
239276,steve_paul,2008-08-13 11:40:00,658,Great report with some amazing pics.  Nice job on the fish - looks like a week to remember.
239286,BillM,2008-08-13 11:54:00,17367,I thought this was going to be a musky report  Awesome pictures!  The scenery is fantastic!
239289,scuro,2008-08-13 12:10:00,386,Excellent report. The pike...just go in there barehanded and grab the jawbone!
239290,John,2008-08-13 12:15:00,2956,Great report and incredible pics Sean. Thank you for sharing your trip.
239303,mistyriver1,2008-08-13 12:32:00,600,Great report Sean.  It is definitely beautiful country up there.  I spent a week there last month and I know I'll definitely be back.
