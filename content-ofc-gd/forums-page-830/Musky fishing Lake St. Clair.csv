In 2006 the VHS virus hit the musky population quite hard but things have turned around and the fishing has been great during this early season. The fish that are now being caught are very healthy and there are a number of smaller 24-28"" fish being caught along with some fatties that survived VHS With 420 sq miles of open water, trolling is the way to cover the area quicky and effectively. Larger cranks have been working well in numerous color schemes. On Sat  a ""Blue Frog"" Woodie was hot, getting hit 4 times. If you are looking to land your first musky LSC is probably your best lake at getting one. Try trolling cranks close to the boat 15-50' back and hold on. "

354620,Bob Devine,2009-06-23 01:14:00,251,"We had 5 hits on Sat and it rained LOTS Fri night with a great light show going into Sat morning at 7am. We left the dock at 9am after the rain and it cleared up and the winds were gusting to over 25 mph, so I was very happy with the results."
