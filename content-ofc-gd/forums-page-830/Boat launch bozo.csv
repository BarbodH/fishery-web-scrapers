353968,HTHM,2009-06-20 20:12:00,4082,"When I have gotten the title of boat launch bozo, I launched at the grand river and forgot to take the transom saver off. It is now at the bottom of the Grand, I got soaked to the waist looking for the darn thing. As Homer says so well; DOH!"
353970,danbouck,2009-06-20 20:14:00,4380,  At least you put the plug in
353978,Roy,2009-06-20 20:38:00,13728,"In the ""Grand"" scheme of things, it won't make a difference. How did it fall off though? It's pinned the the bottom of the trailer and bungied at the top?"
353990,desship,2009-06-20 21:38:00,96,To be fair I should have that honor.Went camping and in a rush did not remove transom saver from motor.Could not figure why boat was sluggish up lake.Pulled into beach felt motor bumping bottom raised motor and low and behold was my transom saver still attached to motor.

354041,HTHM,2009-06-21 01:24:00,4082,"This was help in place by gravity. I should have no problem making another one out of a 2 x 4, won't be as pretty but it will work just as well."
354057,Gerritt,2009-06-21 01:59:00,6129,My adventure last week takes the cake...  I would explain in further detail.... but my fingers still hurt from being nearly crushed...  G
354066,MillerPhoto,2009-06-21 03:24:00,147,"  Love the one when the whole trailer is still attached.  I have a feeling with the amount of ""Bloopers"" that Bill Dance has.. they are staged! There is just no way someone is that clumsy with forgeting to unstrap the boat.. Or somehow the ""Pin"" comes out from the draw bar...."
354074,Fishnwire,2009-06-21 04:41:00,983,  It's beginning to get fairly obvious that Bill Dance is all about the staged bloober.  Nobody is that much of a bonehead that often...and always when there happens to be a camera around?  I don't think so.
354087,archie_james_c,2009-06-21 07:05:00,618,Bill Dance is one hell of a funny man. And if you don't already know that his stuff is done on purpose then you are one gullible man   . 
354095,Radnine,2009-06-21 10:29:00,1538,...plus it will float Jim
354117,boatman,2009-06-21 13:00:00,350,Oh that's not bad at all. If you are a boat launch bozo its not because you forgot the transom saver.
354120,Greencoachdog,2009-06-21 13:13:00,8163,  Ya mean something like this?  
354148,wvmedic,2009-06-21 14:50:00,144,"Just don't take the bow strap off and back down the ramp, then pull back up. You will need to winch you're boat the rest of the way back on the trailer.  I felt like a real Boat launch bozo. And I knew better, just got in a hurry and forgot my brain in the truck!!!  Jeff."
354234,bigugli,2009-06-21 22:52:00,6138,"I've backed the trailer into the water while my son is in the boat to power off. Boat won't budge. Back in a little further boat won't budge. Son finally realizes, as we point at each other, that the rear straps are still on   At least there were no witnesses."
