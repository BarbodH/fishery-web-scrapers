It is essentially a small wet vac with a little soap dispenser put in. It does a reasonable job but tough stains (blood, coffee stains) need to be pre-treated. Good luck! Jim"

354228,Billy Bob,2009-06-21 22:37:00,5865,I just take mine up to the do it yourself car wash and power wash the he!! out of it. Works GREAT but don't use the soap mode. Did that the fist time and had to keep rinsing the heck out of it to get it all out. Spent more money rinsing than washing....  Just turn on your bilge pump when you start......  Bob
