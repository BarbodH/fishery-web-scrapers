No problem.... I am awake at 6 am most days anyways.  Well, here I sit and she is still in la la land  Thank God for little girls...   Happy Fathers day to all the dads and GRAND DADS  out there.   And a SPECIAL wish and prayers for any fathers that have lost a child.   Sincerely,  Splashhopper"

354207,splashhopper,2009-06-21 21:24:00,2931," I invited my friend t ofish with my daughter and i today..  he met us at Pt Stanley to fish,,,  saw the gentleness in him again as he helped my daughter and her friend set their pickeral rigs up for perch fishing...  I also think I saw a tear in his eye too.... as his son was murdered a couple of years ago and i know today is a tough one for him.  I don't ask him about it .... he just knows that i know ... and he knows that is why I invited him today...  Sincerely sorry for your loss G...  Splashhopper and botbot"
354255,Beans,2009-06-22 00:59:00,3339, Mine was a bit older (35) but oh how she loved her dad and fishing...  She would have been proud to hear her son give his valedictorian speech at the graduation ceremony last Friday...sigh...
