353974,northshore,2009-06-20 20:23:00,13,"Hey, just wondering if anyone can help me out.. I have an old homemade trailer, i buy new bearings and repack every 1-2 years, depending on wear. I have a somewhat faulty hub, the grease seal doesn't sit properly into the hub base (the hub is slightly warped from age) - and the bearings always go on this hub prematurely - i have to constantly keep my eye on it and guess when it's going to go. (since the grease seal doesn't sit perfectly snug - water gets in and eventually the bearings fail).  I want to buy a new hubs - but don't know what model to buy. Since it's a homemade trailer using an old car axle.  Here are the bearing measurements, hub specs - maybe someone can help?  4 bolt hub (~3 in apart), front bearing LM12749 (ID 0.8653""), back bearing L68149 (ID 1 3/8""), Grease Seal 19221"
354020,Greencoachdog,2009-06-20 22:32:00,8163," Take one of your old hubs into the parts dept of a marine dealer and see if they can match it.  Hubs are usually classed by the diameter of the spindle they fit on, with 1"" being the most common I believe."
354048,northshore,2009-06-21 01:37:00,13,"yes, unfortunately i have a non-standard spindle for this trailer - it's an old homemade job - it's not a simple 1"" diameter spindle - it requires 2 different bearings for the hub to seat properly - anyway - i maybe able to salvage the hub - if i replace the bearing races - anyone know where i can buy the race for the LM12749 bearing? i'll check Napa on Monday... Keep fish'in"

354375,Billy Bob,2009-06-22 10:33:00,5865,"I don't understand.......you replace the bearing 1 - 2 years without replacing the race.....They are sold in a set, at least every time I purchased them."
354502,northshore,2009-06-22 19:16:00,13,"nope when i buy my bearings they don't usually come with the bearing race/cup. I bought them at Can tire tho... just a thank-you to everyone's suggestions... made a few calls this morning and ""Toronto Belt and Bearing"" had exactly what i needed.. 2 thumbs up to these guys  now i have to put everything back together again, so me and humpty dumpty can go fishing again.."
