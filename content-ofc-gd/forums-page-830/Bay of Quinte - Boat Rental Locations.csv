I can't wait that long for another fishing fix so I'm hoping to head east to the Bay of Quinte on Tuesday for another attempt at the trophy walleyes that everyone has been posing with in their BOQ pics....hoping to put at least 9 to 10 hours on the water compared to the 4 measly hours of my last trip ...  I know that there is a Marina on Big island where I might be able to rent a boat for the day but thats a good 2 hour drive from Scarberia and so.. I was wondering if any of you guys knew of places in Trenton or Belleville that rent out boats for the day....  Also I will most likely be fishing Lake Joseph in Muskoka over the weekend and was wondering if any one has fished this lake and know if the bass/walleye/pike fishing is decent....I will be fishing with a Priest so I know the fishing is gonna be good...Just need to know what to be prepared for..  Thanks in advance for all the info! N
