Maureen  You don't need to spend a lot of money to make Dad happy. Just take his car for a minute and fill it up with gas. Or let him just sit there staring blankly at the tv without having to talk to anyone. Or better yet, when the whole family sits down for dinner, announce that 'Dad, you were absolutely right!' That'll make him smile. Just don't get specific or the compliment will unravel in a hurry.  Red Green"
