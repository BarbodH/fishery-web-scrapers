The Grass was like a Field, It took me about 2 hrs to put the Air conditioner in.  Should of took 15 Minutes.  Then I noticed my Satellite had no Signal.  The trees in front of it now has Foliage blocking it.  Friday was gone and it took me all Saturday to relocate the Satellite and get through to India, Yea Grin Dinh land to diagnose why I was only getting 4 Channels, Poker, Italian, Punjabi and the shopping network.  The most frustrating part, is I pay by the minute on my cell phone.  I throw in about 50 dollars till it runs out.  So I'm in cyber never, never land till I finally get an Operator.  AND I CANT UNDERSTAND HER during the conversations.  So I figure Ill at least get a couple of hours of fishing in.  Off to Hackett hopefully for some Pickerel.  Ill Troll using my Baitcaster, and maybe try some still fishing using my Light outfits, the Mitchell 308 and Shakespeare spinning reels    It took a little while but I got my first Hit around 14 ft.  The water is quite Low as I was pretty far from Shore    Spike at least amuses me.  Sooner or later his nose is either going to get some teeth or treble hooks in it.        I seen the weirdest thing. This boat Barely Moving, obviously over weighted, putter by me with three guys with White Helmets heading to the Far end    On my Radio they were playing    Well I figured maybe I better lay off the German stuff    A couple of small ones trolling     This one ain't Bad     Bonus    Ill Try some still Fishing, using frozen smelt.    Nice little fight on the 6 lb Shakespeare Spinning.  had to cut the Hook on this one.    Stringer on some eaters but put back after the Pic    This got me thinking.  When I first put the boat in, I noticed a guy and his son with an unbelievable amount of fish that was taken out.  Lets see, your allowed 6 Jack, and three Walleye ( That lake 3 others 6).  There two of them.  So, 12 Jack and six walleye.  Incredible, what makes it worse is they're from our neighbor province.  Also the guy that stays here all season for the past 20, tells me and points to 3 Vehicles that he says camps at another Lake, and fishes this one every night taking their limit.  Its going to end like Alberta where the fisheries are collapsing."
