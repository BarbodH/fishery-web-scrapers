349484,splashhopper,2009-06-08 02:21:00,2931,"Well, botbot and I finally got a weekend for a daddy daughter day of fishing yesterday.  I took her up near Paisley to try for some Pike fishing:   We tried a couple of spots on back roads that looked promising with lots of cover for the pike:   We were floating large live minnows under the big floats.  Kind of surprised we didn't get anything at this spot, since I caught two there in the past few weeks.  Bot did  a little toe tapping to keep warm >  we took a look at this spot along the county road too   botbot is wondering about this spot too >>   botbot thinks she may as well practice her Taekwondo near this pond if there are ""no pike here either daddy""   ""Is that where pike like to swim daddy "" ?   Daddy: I'm bored !! ( the dreaded words two hours away from home...  )   So we drove a little further and came upon this at the next spot>>   We scared it away   And tried out luck at this inlet from the marsh area   no luck here... but it is ""really pretty daddy""   Let's try over there daddy >>>   ""how about down there daddy"" ?   ""Daddy: I am gonna try for some bluegills""   ""Daddy: I know this is a bass,, and I know it is ""out of season"", but can you take a picture of the biggest one I EVER caught? Please daddy.... pleeeeeze!  Ok... but then right back in the water   i don't need any grief from the MNR !(or OFC for that matter..   And that was the end of the fishing.... we were hunnngry.... so we stopped for a burger.  All in all, botbot and I had a great daddy daughter day together,,,and I think we will be doing it again for Fathers day next week... maybe start a new tradition for her and i.  Thanks for all your support and we hope to add numbers to our team soon.  Botbot and Splashhopper"
