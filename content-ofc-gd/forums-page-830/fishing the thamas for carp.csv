354106,splashhopper,2009-06-21 12:06:00,2931,Thamas?  or the Thames river ?  Fish it below the rapids if u can get access to the water( stay safe as the banks are pretty slippery right now)..

354126,JohnF,2009-06-21 13:42:00,3494,I think anywhere in the Thames will produce carp. We've covered it pretty well from Mitchell down to a few miles below St.Marys and there are carp everwhere we go. I was checking out a new spot yesterday just south of Mitchell and there were carp literally swimming around my feet.  JF
354127,mepps,2009-06-21 13:44:00,1301,I used to fish the Thames quite a bit when I lived in London. My best spot for carp was right in town at Harris Park.
