352830,John,2009-06-17 12:21:00,2956, I find a spare drainplug helps for those times Roy......
352831,John,2009-06-17 12:22:00,2956, Hey Mike very few of us at Lakair are adults.
352968,ChrisK,2009-06-17 19:34:00,2772,Speil and I will be there Thursday morning with the dogs.....Speils usual campsite. Oh and I'll make sure I bring a sharp filleting knife with me
353035,Spiel,2009-06-17 22:38:00,9065, Thursday morning Chris....THURSDAY !
353048,Rich Clemens,2009-06-17 23:07:00,3131,Wednesdy guys ...   Wednesday.   Gotta get the jump on some of you guys.
353337,Greencoachdog,2009-06-18 22:22:00,8163,"  I think in Roy's case... an ol' ""roastin' ear cob"" would be a better choice."
353550,fishermccann,2009-06-19 14:17:00,655,"Just wondering, why is it always at the same place? There is a lot of water in this province. You have to drive right past some of the best fishing in the world to get THERE."
353597,doubleheader,2009-06-19 18:28:00,497,"Hi all, our Pennsylvania group will be arriving Saturday. My wife Amy, our beast Labrabear pup Cooper, and our good friends Gary and Ellen Hubbard. Looking forward to meeting everyone.  Rich- A ride home to PA can easily be arranged but you may have to ride with Cooper!!!"
353617,Rich Clemens,2009-06-19 19:15:00,3131,"  Looking forward to meeting my Pennsylvania brothers and sisters.  We've arriving Wednesday and leaving the following Wednesday.   So, we'll have some time.    Sharing a ride with Cooper won't be a problem as I'm bring our two girls along as well.  One is a yellow lab and the other is an Airedale Terrier.   Even the dogs will have someone to pal around with, so we'll have to make some introductions.  Emma and Kia got along great with Spiel's dog Brooke and they enjoyed running around and chasing each other.     See you in a little more than a week."
353635,motv8tr,2009-06-19 19:56:00,2587,"  Just taking a guess here, but I think it has something to do with the great hospitality we get at Lakair, and we know them.  It's a great place to go with a group....and ya, the fishing is pretty good too  Maureen"
353641,fishermccann,2009-06-19 20:11:00,655,"Just thought that if you went somewhere new every year you might get some different people,( if thats the idea) , lots can't go that far. Try for different fish in different lakes . We have a lot of great people and places to fish, spread it around! Unless someone has a vested interest in that one spot!"
353649,Rich Clemens,2009-06-19 20:24:00,3131,"Quite a few of the OFC folks have a little GTG on Quinte in the fall as well.    Haven't attended that one, so I hope my memory is serving we well on this one."
353652,John,2009-06-19 20:28:00,2956, Try coming to one you might like us........
353660,fishermccann,2009-06-19 20:41:00,655,"I already do like you, I just wondered why in this great big province why you keep going back to the same spot . It does not seem fair to those who dont like big lake pike fishing."
353672,kickingfrog,2009-06-19 21:27:00,8333," You can't please all the the people all the time.  Last year ""our"" Dawg from the south made the trek from the DEEP south twice in the span of about 3 and a half months. We had members from Virginia, Ohio and 3 generations from Pennsylvania last June, as well as many other points unknown I'm sure. I think that says a lot about the spot, the people and the fishing.  I went last June for the first time, and then made two trips in the fall. I liked it that much, and I grew-up in North Bay and the South Shore of Nipissing.  I would be happy to go elsewhere as well, start working on the details and let me know.  A tradition has to start somewhere."
353676,kickingfrog,2009-06-19 21:35:00,8333," I use my canoe and many others have small boats or use the ceder strips at the lodge. There are small and largemouth bass, walleye, musky and yes pike. Besides the salmonids there is not much that can't be caught close to the lodge.  If I new how to do more than respond to posts and search for porn I'd provide a link to some maps of the area. It is on Lake Nipissing but the west arm is much different than the rest of the lake.  Drop by, the group is not that scary, and most of them are drunk anyway."
354059,Rizzo,2009-06-21 02:13:00,4754,"Why fix what isn't broken? Kevin and Leslie are great hosts, the fishing is great (and not just pike), I believe nipissing is reasonably well known for its pickerel (and under-rated) bass fishing. Personally, other than a few hours on Saturday, I'm only after musky. With so many OFC'ers attending each year, you'd think if people weren't very satisfied this event would have been moved long ago. I say it stays right where it is, and if you can't be bothered to find out for yourself why we host it there its your loss."
354431,LeXXington,2009-06-22 15:14:00,1928,"I have been going for 3+ years with this being my 4th. I can say that Lakair is one of thoes places that has it all.. Fishing, and great staff.  I am sure  there are other spots too go fishing, but none will be the lakair experiance.  I would go where ever a G2G but Kevin and Leslie do a good spread so it all works out."
345907,Roy,2009-05-28 23:14:00,13728,"This 'll be a good place to get a feel for who'll be attending. Everyone is welcome. If you haven't already, please make your reservations now if you're planning on attending. Again this year we will hold it at LAKAIR. Please use this thread to discuss your plans so that we have an idea as to who will be there. Let her rip."
345929,rbaquial,2009-05-29 00:10:00,968,If I wasn't getting married this year - I'd for sure be down!
345934,Rizzo,2009-05-29 00:16:00,4754,"after a 2 year absence I hope to be back at Lakair this year. My plan is to arrive late wed eve or early Thurs morning, and then leave after my victory in the Crapola cup pike tourney! Got a patch of dirt booked for my tent, but more importantly, a spot for the boat"
346181,Rich Clemens,2009-05-29 19:54:00,3131,"Add 2 more. Patsy, myself, and our two four-legged girls. Arriving Wednesday June 24 and checking out Wednesday July 1. I think we're in Cabin 5 ... somewhere along the gravel roadway. I hear we have another group coming in from PA this year - cabin 11 if I remember correctly  (Wonder if a OFC shore lunch in possible for Friday ?)"
346190,Roy,2009-05-29 20:27:00,13728,"It'll be great to see you guys again Rich, looking forward to it. Are the other Pennsylvanians OFNers?"
346197,John,2009-05-29 21:13:00,2956," I think that Rich is talking about doubleheader Roy.  Barbara and I will be there, arriving probably noonish Friday and leaving noonish Monday.  I am pretty sure we have cabin 7 or 9 booked."
346200,Rich Clemens,2009-05-29 21:31:00,3131,  Indeed it is DoubleHeader.  Lucky guy is there for two weeks.  Maybe I'll just have to send Patsy and the girls home after the first week and hitch a ride back to PA later on.   Sounds like one of those plans that just ain't gonna fly here at home.
346203,Roy,2009-05-29 21:43:00,13728,"AHHHHHHHHH! Doubleheader, that's right! I'm losing my mind. That ain't too bad though, John. What's bad is when your bumhole loses its ability to distinguish 'tween wet and dry."
346212,motv8tr,2009-05-29 22:24:00,2587,"I'll be there early Friday morning to set up my tent and leaving Sunday morning....no boat this year so hopefully some kind soul will take pity on me, otherwise the dock will work just fine   I happen to know that the odd BIG girl swims in the area  Maureen"
346320,ccmtcanada,2009-05-30 12:38:00,7971,Bly and I will be there from Friday mid afternoon til Monday morning!  Reservations made...hope there's room for our little boat there at the docks!
346350,TJQ,2009-05-30 14:20:00,7806,Ill be there with wife and kids from thursday to sunday!
346467,Loonietoon,2009-05-31 01:39:00,1450,Arriving Thursday Morning for sure.. Spot reserved for Camper Van and Dock spot to
346486,kickingfrog,2009-05-31 03:41:00,8333,"I'm ready to go NOW! No dock spot needed for the canoe, but I wouldn't be adverse to warming a spot in someones boat a time or two as well. Don't worry you'll recognize me, I'll be at the docks with my best lost puppy dog face on.  I'm there Thursday to Sunday.  Don't forget the bug dope or bug jackets."
346716,Joey,2009-06-01 01:12:00,9122,"We're booked for a camping spot and dock spot starting Friday for a week, maybe a week and a day or two.  Can't wait now  Joey"
346717,capt_hooked,2009-06-01 01:15:00,212,Leslie and I are looking forward to seeing everyone again...   btw.. last day of May and we had snow flurries here most of the day... ouch!...  I'm sure it'll be warmer by the time OFNers get here...  the cap't.    p.s... here's a funny one... took place in the West Arm Pike Tournament yesterday... worked hard all day to catch one little bitty 16 inch pike... so embarrassing...!  oh well... some days are like that... I'll just like my wounds fro a couple of days.. dry my tears... and I'll be alright... sniff...!
346725,bassmastermike,2009-06-01 01:48:00,295,Ill be there for 14 days with my uncle june 15 to the 28th RV spot and dockspot booked !!!Looking forward to seeing everybody again..... Also can't wait to catch some Nippissing BASS.
346937,LeXXington,2009-06-01 17:28:00,1928,Me and Family folk will be there Thursday afternoon out sunday after noon.  
347206,Dondorfish,2009-06-02 02:52:00,1000,"Skeeter and his wife Kelly, and myself ( Tracker ) will be there sometime Thursday till Sunday. Can't wait!   Don "
350528,skeeter,2009-06-10 03:10:00,1907,Are we going to be doing a pot luck on saturday night ??
350630,TJQ,2009-06-10 12:00:00,7806,"Yup, tourney from 11-2, prizes from 4-5 and pot luck supper with me cooking fish from 5-7, on Saturday!"
350691,John,2009-06-10 14:17:00,2956," You forgot about the 2.30 - 4.00 filleting Pike! I would be happy to help again this year, if you need some re-enforcements and the beer flows steadily."
352516,TJQ,2009-06-16 15:30:00,7806,I will definitely need reinforcements....  But im pretty pick about bones.. ya gotta know what your doing... last year we had a few mistakes.. i like it totally boneless!!
352538,John,2009-06-16 17:15:00,2956," Last year was pretty good, you and Chris were filleting, I was skinning. The year before was a nightmare with names that will remain nameless....lol It all depends on the ratio of beer to pike....tip it too far the wrong way and well, you know!"
352606,kickingfrog,2009-06-16 20:19:00,8333, TJ and Chris can count to 20 together still... That doesn't mean that they have 10 digits each however.
352610,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-16 20:33:00,3761,"Looks like it'll be a fun trip. Be sure to take lot's of pictures, almost a adult and well im sure in the next year or so i'll be up there fishing and having a good time!   Have fun, MTBF"
