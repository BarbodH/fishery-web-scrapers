354286,Green,2009-06-22 02:14:00,20,"Went up for our annual trip to the bush June 6-13. As usual it was awesome, we caught quite a number of walleye and pike. The walleye were on average larger than how we did last year however the Pike were not in the shallows yet and we did not raise anything of good quality. Couldn't believe the bugs were not out the whole week we were there! Which made for a very comfortable week.   Flight out was delayed by 3-4 hours due to the weather. The ride was quite bumpy and was very close to using the good ole vomit bag. Didn't help that we wolfed down a foot long sub an hour prior to the flight.        Some of the Walleye caught during the week           By the way do you guys know what kind of fish this is? Caught a bunch of them all week.    Various pictures from the week                 Until next year."

354298,ptmpete,2009-06-22 02:32:00,49,     Your small one looks like a chub
354315,crankbait,2009-06-22 03:05:00,82,  Looks like a great time! What is this?

354353,Jonny,2009-06-22 04:33:00,1380,"Flying in a DHC Beaver --- quintessential Canadian bushplane --- nice!   It could be a chub. More likely a lake chub than a creek chub. Creek chub has a black spot at the base of the caudal (tail) fin. Lake chub and creek chub are proper I.D. names. There's also a river chub, and several more distinct species.  However, chubs average only about 4"" long. If I gauge the size of your fish correctly from the photo, it's considerably larger than that.  If I'm properly seeing a small darker area at the base of each scale, and if the fish is more like 10-12"" long, it could very well be a fallfish.  ""Large adults, quite silvery in overall appearance, are usually called silver chub by trout fishermen who catch them unintentionally... at times [they] cause considerable annoyance, especially if they occur in numbers. Since adult fallfish attain weights in excess of 1 pound, they may be fished for sport in their own right. The flesh is firm, white and sweet.""  --- From ""Freshwater Fishes of Canada"" "
