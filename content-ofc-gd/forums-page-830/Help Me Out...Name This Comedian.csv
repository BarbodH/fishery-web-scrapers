354040,pikehunter,2009-06-21 01:22:00,1659,I dunno who you are asking about but I do know that Jackie Mason is still alive.
354050,Daplumma,2009-06-21 01:41:00,1961,Sam it is..He was a blast back in the day when he was on Howard Stern. Joe
354051,Fishnwire,2009-06-21 01:51:00,983,He wasn't really my cup of tea...but apparently he was and is considered one of the true innovators and a real genius by other professional comedians.
354061,Dave Mercer,2009-06-21 02:28:00,148,He was one of the greats Sam was an original and that is what I respected about him. Some may like him and some may not but his stuff was his and not ripped off which is very rare now days in any industry especially comedy!
