Anybody know of a Canadian based supplier or store that carries this, or something very similar to it?  PS: was at Bass Pro on weekend and they did not have it."
354468,John,2009-06-22 16:58:00,2956, I would bite the bullet and pay the shipping. By the time you find someone who has it here and spend the gas to go and pick it up you have already spent the price + shipping. Make sure they ship USPS and not UPS or FedEx though.
