354462,mpt,2009-06-22 16:45:00,158,Did you read the story about the guy that was brokedown? The motor wouldn't start and bad weather was approaching. He had caught 2 20# muskies and had them on a stringer. He put each on a lead and then attaches them to the middle of the boat. In the front of the boat he sets up a rod with lure to dangle in front of the fish. The fish try to catch the lures and in the process tow him to shore. Supposedly true...
