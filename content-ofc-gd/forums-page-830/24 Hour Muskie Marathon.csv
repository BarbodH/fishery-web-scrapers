353883,mepps,2009-06-20 16:12:00,1301,"The other day, my wife asked me what I wanted for Fathers Day and my reply was simple. I want to catch a muskie. Of course, you all know that is easier said then done...  Living in Nova Scotia makes somewhat hard to find muskie, impossible in fact, there are none. Luckily for me Fredericton, New Brunswick is only 4.5 hours away, and there are some big muskie being caught (www.muskiesnb.ca). I had made plans to meet up with Derek Rowe of  Muskies Canada in the afternoon, but seeing as that this was one of my few days I have all to myself, I decided to make a full day of it. 24 hours.  I left Halifax shortly after midnight. I had tried to get some sleep, but the combination of a splitting headache and visions of grandeur kept me awake. I figured I may as well start driving because I wont be sleeping any time soon. The drive was perfect, hardly a car on the road. I got into Fredericton around 4:30 am and made my way to the north launch. I made my first cast with the sunrise at 5am and didnt stop until the sun was starting to set.  I started on foot and walked the shoreline near the launch. Started at one bridge, and made my way to the other and beyond. I used spinner baits in the shallow water, and switched it up to a 10 inch Suick (sucker pattern) in the deeper areas. Had plenty of follows...from bass and perch, but no muskie. I managed to get a nice size chain pickerel, but that was it.   I grabbed a bite to eat around noon and then broke out the bass gear for an hour to give my arms a rest from casting muskie lures. Met Derek at the launch around quarter to 4pm and we quickly raced up river. Finally some good looking muskie territory!  My selection of muskie lures is pretty small right now. I left most of it back in Ontario because I didnt know I'd be muskie fishing when I moved out east! I only had lures that are considered small in the world of muskie fishing (7-8 inches) The larger lures that I had recently made and intended to use were both lost to snags while shore fishing.  After one look at Derek's lure selection I knew these Eastern beauties wanted a bigger snack. After about 30 minutes of casting my own lures, Derek suggested I try one of his - within minutes, his advise paid off, a 34 inch beauty, my first NB muskie!    The first thing I noticed with these NB fish is that their girth, this 34 incher had a bigger girth then the Jack Lake and Scugog muskie I used to catch in Ontario  Shortly after this fish was boated, it was Dereks turn. He made sure he wasn't going to be outdone, and landed this big girl that was just shy of 40 inches with a 19 inch girth!    After he caught his fish we moved down river. Then it began to rain. Then the wind picked up. The fishing slowed down, but Derek took this time to give me some great tips and shared some of his serious knowledge of the river. Its a whole new world fishing a big river for muskie! We ended the day back near the spot where the fish were caught earlier. The rain had stopped and the wind was almost gone, but no more fish were caught so we called it a day shortly before 9. I jumped in the car and made may way home in the dark, another 4.5 hours.   My stats for the day:  Time spent driving: 9 hours Total distance driven: 900+ km Distance on foot: 6 km Time spent fishing: 15 hours Number of lures lost: 2 Number of blisters: 1 Number of perch caught: 5 Number of chain pickerel caught: 1 Number of bass caught: 1 Number of muskie caught: 1 Number of casts: 10001 Time spent sleeping: 0 hours  Mission accomplished."

353906,johnnyb,2009-06-20 17:08:00,3413,Awesome stats breakdown...persistence and confidence obviously paid off!  Pretty slick looking musky...very green.  And talk about girth...their heads look too small for their bodies    Thanks for the great report!
353911,Roy,2009-06-20 17:28:00,13728,"WTG Clive!   Great report from the East. If you ever get hungry, you have a 10 fish limit on muskie there.  Thanks for sharing."
353914,MCTFisher9120,2009-06-20 17:33:00,3761,"wow, what beautiful looking musky, love those strong green colors they show.  Congrads on a great outing!   MTBF"
353930,Spiel,2009-06-20 18:13:00,9065,"Those are indeed some great looking musky Clive, as johnnyb said ""very green"". Good of you to point out the 10 fish limit Roy....LOL  Over all a great report.    I wish I had half of your energy and drive."
353939,Rich Clemens,2009-06-20 18:35:00,3131,"That's a great specimen there Mepps and great coloring.   Congrats and, oh yeah,  HAPPY FATHER'S DAY"
353961,jediangler,2009-06-20 19:45:00,1923,Great report Clive. I didn't know there were musky in New Brunswick. Learn something new everyday.
353983,splashhopper,2009-06-20 21:08:00,2931,amazing colours on your musky..  Thanks for the adventure  splashhopper
353987,Musky or Specks,2009-06-20 21:26:00,2710,Both of those fish look like tigers. What the history of the musky fishery on the St John's  Some quick googling  http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2001/06/20/nb_dnmusk010620.html
353988,SlowPoke,2009-06-20 21:28:00,2984,Great report Clive! The family and I are planning a 'down east' vacation; I may have to bring the boat with me!  Brian
354016,mepps,2009-06-20 22:26:00,1301,"There are some big fish to be had in the Saint John river, last years biggest reported catch was 52""x27"" - and just minute from downtown Fredericton!  Definitely bring the boat Brian, but be warned fishing on a river this big is really tough! The guy who took me out is a guide!  Yeah Roy, the limits here are ridiculous! 10 muskie      -       size 10cm -170cm (thats 66.9 inches!)   Also, no license is needed in this area because it is considered tidal water. The water level changes dramatically with the tides coming in from the Bay of Fundyy."
354030,Joey,2009-06-20 23:50:00,9122,"Wow, what an adventure, but I'm sure it was well worth it.  Way to go Clive  Happy Father's Day.  Joey"

354262,superdad,2009-06-22 01:17:00,353,"Congrats on your first NB Musky.  I know several people who are fishing in the Fredericton area for' Mr Toothy""  You can check this site out for further info on NB Musky.  http://www.newbrunswickfishing.com/forum/  Cheers  David aka  Superdad Kingston ON"
354421,mepps,2009-06-22 14:34:00,1301,"Thanks superdad, I'll check it out. I actually joined muskies Canada a few weeks ago and have been getting some great info from their forums."
354472,leighfns,2009-06-22 17:13:00,103,Wow..  They look so different then the ones around here.  Congrats!! I had absolutely no idea they were in NB.  Have you been able to get in some Striper fishing out that way?
354514,mepps,2009-06-22 20:02:00,1301,"I missed the main part of the striper run this spring while I was in Ontario, but I'll give it a shot next time!  The same spot I caught that muskie also produces some nice stripers."
