353796,HTHM,2009-06-20 02:55:00,4082,"Is there anyone who is going to Lakair that lives near Big Cliff's place? If so, I would ask that you could pick up my weed wacker at Cliff's and bring it to Lakair and then give it to Spiel so that I can pick it up at his place. Thanks a lot!"
353834,Spiel,2009-06-20 12:46:00,9065,Anyone? I'll do my bit if it gets to Lakair.
353842,Big Cliff,2009-06-20 13:53:00,6899,"Not to worry, I'll be delivering it to Albert tomorrow."
353869,Gerritt,2009-06-20 14:55:00,6129,Albert.... I still have those Minn Kota controls ..... what do you want me to do with em?
353878,HTHM,2009-06-20 15:36:00,4082,"That new style pedal that I gave to that guy? If you can find a use for them, go for it. They will not work with my motor, *sigh*."
353885,Gerritt,2009-06-20 16:12:00,6129,Ok.... I will hang onto it.... still need to hook up to give you the crate back too....  G
354046,HTHM,2009-06-21 01:32:00,4082,"Yep he is, what a guy!"
354053,Fishnwire,2009-06-21 01:54:00,983,"When I read the first line of your the initial post I thought this was about an illegal drug transaction.  Then I realized you wanted your weed-wacker, not your weed.  "
354093,ccmtcanada,2009-06-21 10:12:00,7971,Bly and I are headed up to Sturgeon Lake this morning...didn't see your note Big Cliff...I had called you (talked to Sue) about us picking it up and taking it to Lakair.  I'll call you from the water in case for some reason you were not able to deliver it.
354170,Big Cliff,2009-06-21 16:48:00,6899,"Mission accomplished!  , Actually it worked out well because Albert had a back pack blower he wanted me to look at for him, he was going to send it up to Lakair and then have someone bring it back down to me but as it turns out it is an older John deer blower and I wouldn't have been able to get parts for it except from John deer (if I could have gotten them at all).  Anyway it was nice seeing you again even if it was only briefly, hope you enjoy the trimmer!  Sorry I couldn't help you with the blower."
354173,Sinker,2009-06-21 17:15:00,8692," Wouldn't happen to be a Power drive foot pedal would it?    I""m gonna need one real soon for mine......its acting up.  S."
354175,Gerritt,2009-06-21 17:38:00,6129," I do believe it is for a power drive... The end has been removed, so you would need to splice it with your existing end....  G"
354191,HTHM,2009-06-21 19:10:00,4082,"If you want it it is yours, PM Gerrit to get it"
354201,Sinker,2009-06-21 20:33:00,8692,"  TYVM sir!!  If your ever in the kawartha lakes, or looking to go fishing out this way, get in touch!  S."
