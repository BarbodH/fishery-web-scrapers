354487,splashhopper,2009-06-22 18:01:00,2931,I was just reminded that I have a speaking engagement this Saturday morning in Waterloo.  Then the guy who reminds me asks me to go with him to another friends mother's wake at Laurel  Creek conservation area that same day.  I am hoping there are some fish there?  Ayyone know?  Thanks  Splashhopper
354492,Marko,2009-06-22 18:21:00,854,I know there are some carp and pan fish in there. Not sure about bass.
354528,Victor,2009-06-22 20:48:00,1609,"According to the GRCA, there's only carp in there.  Laurel Creek Reservoir  Why not try the Grand? It's minutes away from there."

Check to see if anyone at the wake owns property on Paradise Lake . Great bass fishing just upstream from the C.A.. But it all private access.
354555,timmeh,2009-06-22 22:26:00,609,The reservoir is drawn down to a small trickle during the winter and as such there is very little in terms of fish in there. I wouldn't waste your time fishing there. There are better options around if you have time (PM sent).
