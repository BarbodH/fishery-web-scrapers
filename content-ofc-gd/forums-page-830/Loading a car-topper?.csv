353959,jediangler,2009-06-20 19:40:00,1923,Buy after market cross bars that are long enough to fit your boat. I highly doubt that an X-trail roof rack is rated for a 12ft aluminum. Check out Sportspal canoes. With a transom model it's just like a little fishing boat. Or just get a trailer.
353973,johnnyb,2009-06-20 20:23:00,3413,Couple of 2x4's will widen the racks nicely...but you should check the load ratings for said racks.
353984,siwash,2009-06-20 21:17:00,683,Thanks guys... good point about load.. but how much does a 12 tin weigh? isn't less than 200lb?  As for the 2X4 should I place them alongside the current crossbars? how do they stay in place?  I see people with those 12' tins with pretty small vehicles...  thanks again
