354212,silvio,2009-06-21 21:35:00,433,Hey guys been awhile since I've posted. tomorrow is my last exam and I know there are going to be days were I am bored and can get out a fish. just wondering if the river or canal (I know one is the Holland river and the other is a canal along canal rd in Bradford) has any decent fishing and what species exist in it. I know its pretty polluted so this is just to pass some time. Not looking for spots mostly looking for species that are present and weather the canal or the Holland river will be a better bet. thanks
