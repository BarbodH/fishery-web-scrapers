354310,yo_guy,2009-06-22 02:53:00,111,You have to becareful of what you post on OFC despite what your good intentions were.  One thing to remember never post anything OOS. lol
354311,Bassaholic,2009-06-22 02:57:00,74,"Just try to ignore the OOS protesters. They just love to jump on these threads. Great looking fish though, just too bad it was OOS. You just have to wait till next weekend when those ""nesting"" bass magically adandon their nests and fry because they know we're after them. Then you wont have to feel guilty for accidentally catching them."
354312,StoneFly,2009-06-22 02:57:00,574," Not offended AT all SF, just laughing over here at symantics.  I see 100's of salmon/steelhead caught illegally all the time every year,...put my personally safety at risk tyring to help/school the ignorant offenders.  Roll your eyes all you want, its not gonna make next saturday come any quicker for you..."
354314,StoneFly,2009-06-22 03:03:00,574," Good Point, but what does the 'Magical date' of the reg's actually mean?  NOTTA!!!  mother nature dictates it and it goes by no calender.  the 30-60 day varience by when the Stleehead show up in rivers is not governed by a calender its weather conditions, Bass are the same,...Can we please get real here?  If the MNR had the funding, they might change the dates here and there or maybe adopt some other provinces practices.  Last sat in June can mean way too late or lots of fishing,...same as Sept 30 or Last sat in April."
354316,Bassaholic,2009-06-22 03:08:00,74,"       ...But just to make it clear, I dont agree with OOS fishing. Just common sense. It was an accidental catch that was released quickly. If you're going to jump all over him you'd better check out splashhoppers post and give his little girl some of the same grief."
354318,blarg,2009-06-22 03:13:00,289,  So because the mnr might not have the perfect start of season date it's ok to purposefully catch fish out of season..i didn't know that.

354322,Jonny,2009-06-22 03:17:00,1380,"Who made the rule about what you can call your personal best and OOS fish not qualifying? Personal best is kind of self-explanatory.  I was trolling shoals and weedlines today and picked up two 2 lb smallmouth (and released them). If one of them had been bigger than any SMB I had ever caught before, you can bet I'd call it my ""personal best"".  I'd say give the guy a break. He isn't going to break the bank, fishing from a dock, with a 100 ft cast radius, and releasing everything he catches. If he says he was hoping for a pike or two it might be neighbourly to just take him at his word, instead of coming on like a Conservation Officer looking for an infraction."
354324,StoneFly,2009-06-22 03:27:00,574," where do you get 'Purposely' from ?  how many SMB do you catch with a flyrod?  Rockbass are alot of fun, lemme tell ya,..ever try it?  did I use Live bait ?  NO!!!  Even dew worms?  NO.... once we realized it was Sunfish, we just used light steelhead set-up, with a crappy rod/reel,...I know I see them do that in tournies all the time.....  , hmmmmmmmmm   if i was expecting a big bass like that would I have done that?  Give your head a shake.....some of you bass guys gotta get a life....for reel,...No pun intended,.."
354326,ciceri,2009-06-22 03:29:00,535,"I wouldn't worry about it, I've caught too many OOS bass this season, not on purpose, they just go for anything here."
354327,StoneFly,2009-06-22 03:29:00,574,"Sorry, I lied,...I did catch a few monster ants and a few horse flys and actually used those as bait for the rock bass and I used the flyfod,...does that count as live bait?  was that enethical if a Bass hit it?"
354331,StoneFly,2009-06-22 03:33:00,574," Not worried at all,...Just glad it was a SMB and Not LMB,...as I know that makes it SO MUCH SWEETER....LOL  ...and that little piggy is still there waiting for round 2,..maybe next weekend,..maybe later,...maybe never...but she sure tided me over til some real fishing starts in about 2 months..."
354332,StoneFly,2009-06-22 03:35:00,574, what were you trolling for?
354337,fishing,2009-06-22 03:44:00,167,"Very nice fish. But, quote ""It is illegal to attempt to catch fish for which the season is closed, even if you are going to release them. Fish accidentally caught during the closed season must be immediately released back to the water.""   Hope that fish can be released ""immediately"" http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/198219.pdf"
354344,StoneFly,2009-06-22 03:56:00,574," Thanks for the cut and paste....Come and check out Erindale park,...for example around Sept 15th.  other than that,..if you want to do some real fishing,..PM me,....should start in about 2-3 months,..+/- 30 days,...go figure..."
354348,StoneFly,2009-06-22 04:12:00,574,Just for FUN!!!!                  
354349,cram,2009-06-22 04:15:00,1733,"Weird how whatever happens on trout and salmon rivers makes it okay to fish for OOS bass.  Anyway, they are NICE fish.  Probably 3lbs +.  Fishing on topwater is huge fun.....try a zara spook if you really want to have a blast."
354352,StoneFly,2009-06-22 04:30:00,574," Wow 3.0 - 5.5lbs with an actual length measurement....You Bass guys know your stuff!!!  Lol.  As said,..this was simply a fix between REAL fishing for me,... that 3-5.5 lb SMB was released to go cover her eggs and give the lazy armchair/boat guys a shot in as week or so...although as stated noone fishes that lake,....so maybe I will catch her in August when Im up there again,...To be quite honest,...this was a 4-5lb bass on gear that I catch 20lb+ salmon and 10lb+ steelhead,...rod and reel diffrerent,...but rig and line very similiar,...IMO,..bass fishing is a bit of a joke....anyone one of you Bass guys want a challenge and reward,...message me closer to end of august,...until then,..have fun!!!!"
354356,cram,2009-06-22 05:02:00,1733," Man.  Not sure why i deserved that, but here are some parting thoughts....  1 - while i don't really care if people post pics of OOS fish, you're acting like a bit of a nimkumpoop.  If you don't like bass fishing, fine.   But don't act like you wouldn't be a bit tiffed if someone caught a bunch of OOS trout and posted all of this (what you've said) about it.  Give me a break.  2 - while i am going by look (no idea how big you are, but have seen a LOT of bass) following is a pretty good chart showing SMB weight vs. length.  Your almost 20 inch fish is a nice 3 lbs.  "
354357,Jonny,2009-06-22 05:02:00,1380, We were trolling for pike.
354361,StoneFly,2009-06-22 05:34:00,574," 6' 200lbs...  ..quoted the other 5.0-5.5lbs from another post on this thread,..easy weasy,...again,...have some fun ...  nice graph.....I just think Bass are a laugh if you want to do some real fishing,..thats all...again watch what you say about 'a bunch' of OOS fish....get it straight........lemme ask you this...99% of pics taken of fish from peeps that have no clue of what fishing is are of what species?  SMB?  could that be the lack of challenge or skill? Lol.  Next time you see someone land a 10+lb steelhead on the river in shorts and T-shirt and boobs,...Lemme know...  then again,..do you remember what boobs look like?  except for the WWW that is...Lol"
354362,cram,2009-06-22 05:40:00,1733, smart
354363,Jonny,2009-06-22 06:18:00,1380," I know you feel some guys were trying to tear a strip off you, but I think you made your point a while back already.  I'm one of those (unskilled) SMB fishermen too. But I could say (from personal experience) that you haven't fished until you've landed a 35 lb chinook on a windy day on Superior, or worked you ass off fighting thru tag-alders to tease creek specks out from under fallen logs and cut-under banks. But I wouldn't. To each his own. When you've got your system down right for a particular species, you meet success, but there should generally be no snobbishness to it if you're talking to other people who just plain enjoy fishing."
354372,Roy,2009-06-22 10:24:00,13728,No more blood to be drawn from this one. Take it to PM please.
354259,StoneFly,2009-06-22 01:13:00,574,"took off for a long weekend up to the cottage with the lady.  Great time all around, even the bugs werent too bad.  I dont consider myself to be a Bass Fisherman by any means, but we had a great time nailing 100's of huge huge rock bass and smallies on everything from flies to spinners to rubber worms to 1"" rubber crawfish all from the end of the dock.  Weather was great for the most part, except saturday rained all day.  lost a few 2-3lb smallies and the highlite as for fishing goes was my PB for Bass (20"", guessing 4-5lbs) still cant tell if it is an SMB or LMB, that how much I fish for bass,...Lol  Lisa with one of the hundreds of little ones..        Then the big one on a 1"" rubber crawdad          SMB or LMB????"
354260,Marko,2009-06-22 01:15:00,854,"smb, very nice one"
354264,backbay,2009-06-22 01:18:00,773,"Wow! And your dock in located where, exactly?"
354266,ciceri,2009-06-22 01:27:00,535,"Don't fall forward, lol."
354269,StoneFly,2009-06-22 01:33:00,574," Small lake, north of Huntsville.  I have actually seen that big Bass swimming around before, I guess Saturday was our lucky day.  Was a little nervous once I saw it jhooked as I knew I only had 4lb flouro for line and about a $50 ultralite rig including rod and reel, Lol.  Pretty nice fight on her.  Anyone guess the weight?  Age?"
354270,StoneFly,2009-06-22 01:35:00,574," BAHAHAHAHAHAHA, Lol, but the Tape doesnt lie.."
354272,Rizzo,2009-06-22 01:40:00,4754,good stuff! I'd guess thats a 5 to 5.5 pound smallie. We catch them in our lake like that too (20-21 inches and fat) but I've never weighed one before. The best fishing at our lake is also at the end of our dock...doesn't hurt that I've tossed 50 good-sized rocks down there to improve the odds! Nice fish
354273,BillM,2009-06-22 01:41:00,17367,"Bah, you can't count OOS fish as personal bests   Just hope it's still there in a week, lol"
354277,StoneFly,2009-06-22 01:52:00,574,
354279,Court R,2009-06-22 01:56:00,213,Opens last Saturday in June.
354280,NANUK,2009-06-22 01:56:00,797,"Nice big smallies, how deep is around your dock? Looks like you were pulling them right out of their nests. Huntsville area is Zone 15 , bass season opens 4th Saturday in June, unless there is an exception I don't know about."
354282,Cudz,2009-06-22 02:02:00,2652,oos
354284,StoneFly,2009-06-22 02:04:00,574," We were flyfishing and using little float rigs to catch mainly big RockBass all with artificials, hoping for a pike, the SMB's were a kindof a surprise.  All were returned regardless."
354285,BillM,2009-06-22 02:08:00,17367,"I'm sure the fish will still be there dude, lol.  It's hard to keep the damn things off your line at this time of year."
354287,NANUK,2009-06-22 02:15:00,797,"One bass is a surprise........maybe two, NOT that many, when you start getting that many OOS bass in an area you have to stop fishing that area for obvious reasons, you just edited your post where you stated/thought June 15th was bass opener, I saw that! Besides even if you knew they were OOS, taking pictures on the dock and calling them your PB"
354289,StoneFly,2009-06-22 02:16:00,574," Well its about 12' at the end,...but the fish was hooked about 2' from the surface and about 20' from the end of the dock.  Wasnt really too sure about Reg's as it had nothing to do with steelheading, lol and since we let them go,...what is the harm?  As for what was I targeting, really wasnt targeting anything, but I knew there were rockbass and the GF wanted to fish, hoping for a pike the first day but the Sunfish were fun.  The lunker was a gift and we gave her back."
354291,StoneFly,2009-06-22 02:18:00,574, Do RockBass = SMB or LMB or Sunfish?  The big one with pics is the same fish!!
354292,Pigeontroller,2009-06-22 02:19:00,2793,"Yep, catching that many Bass before the opener and saying you were fishing for Sunfish doesn't cut it with me. Some might call it poaching."
354295,NANUK,2009-06-22 02:28:00,797,I don't see a single rockbass in any of the pictures if the big one is the same fish then I wonder if it survived that long out of the water.
354296,StoneFly,2009-06-22 02:31:00,574," Did you have one eye closed to read it?  Lol,...This lake was rated to be one of the most polluted in Ontario not too many years ago, do to irreconcilable reasons,  so to get a large SMB like that was a total shock.  this is not a fishing lake,...as in noone fishes it.  To me, it was nice to see the natural species doing well.  BTW if I was targetting big bass I may have gone about it differently, but since I dont own a boat or have the gear, I used cheap crap for sunfish once i realized Pike were not around.    just chill and go polish your $40,000 boat and dream of next weekend.  Maybe I will go back next saturday with my crappy-tire rod and reel and out fish you..Lol"
354297,markiemark70,2009-06-22 02:31:00,158,"  Hey sorry you are kinda getting jumped on here, it's just that we all like you really love fishin. It was a great report and i really enjoyed it, but I just want to address the ""what is the harm"" so that you will know and hopefully educate other people. The reason that even catching fish oos is bad is that even though you return the fish to the water, by the time it finds its nest again, smaller fish such as Perch or Sunfish may have raided the nest and eaten all of the eggs. So in a very real way you are impacting the population of that species.  Again, just offering this as some information that you may choose to do with what you wish."
354301,StoneFly,2009-06-22 02:40:00,574," How many pics of Rockbass do you take?  LMAO.  Out of the water about 30 Seconds, revived her like a nice steelhead, WAY better than most Bass guys ever do.  BTW,..used a #12 barbless steelhead hook, again not knowing about the Big bass.  Hmmmm,...what size hooks do you use?  Im bettin that fish survived better than most you catch with your trebles etc.  How many have you killed with that style?  did you stop fishing when they bled?  im pretty sure you let fish that bleed go and have broken the rules many times ...KNOWINGLY!!!!"
354305,NANUK,2009-06-22 02:47:00,797,"Natural species won't be doing well if people keep pulling them out OOS, with crappy-tire rod and reel or whatever, as other poster mentioned by the time they get back to their nests their eggs are eaten by pan fish. sorry you are offended, just calling it the way it is, BTW, I don't have a $40,000 boat, just a couple of rods and reels and a regulation book. good luck next Saturday, you have the right attitude"
354308,Kenny G,2009-06-22 02:49:00,118,Nice fish either way. Probably 5+lbs Kenny G.
354309,StoneFly,2009-06-22 02:52:00,574," Appreciated for sure.  However, Reg's aside, dont even get me started on Reg's.  The fish was 20' from any nest and was only 2' down in atleast 12' of water, so it was crusin, the nest was abandonded anyways.   Again, not a Bass guy here, but an Avid Steelheader, so If anyone can appreciate what you are saying, I can.....No offence to anyone,..but its usually the Bass guys that break the salmon/steelhead Reg's,...Lol  the difference is that they KNOW it.  So since I did not know there were OOS fish to be caught, and one was, should I have ripped the lip right off?  Since I didnt even know if it was LMB or SMB and it was the biggest I ever caught, should I have not taken a pic?  would this have helped the fishery?"
