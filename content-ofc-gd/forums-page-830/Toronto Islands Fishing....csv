354220,gone_fishin,2009-06-21 21:53:00,481,fishing with jerkbaits would be your best option for pike... husky jerks in blue/silver/orange and firetiger are the top 2 for the islands. for bass you can go with spinnerbaits or throw plastics.

There are lots of big carp and suckers in warmer water areas within the islands...don't have any suggestions for what to use to catch them.  Bass opens next weekend and weedless jigs, plastics and spinners will be my main choices.  There is a place within the islands that rents row boats and sells bait.  I've heard there are lots of panfish around that area too.  Good luck and let us know how it turns out.  Yakpiker"

I'd take a look online, or call them in advance before driving an hour or so to get there.  ryan"
