(his name is Toby) and the kid who worked for me a few summers ago (Alex)... out together for an hour or so....... caught a 45-inch+ and fat musky on a tube bait, yesterday evening... `  They were fishing for walleyes..  But man did they have face-to-face grins and a great story to tell...!  fish was released with no harm.. but atlas no camera and no picture...!  It was the first time for Toby to see a musky.. so I was really glad for him... and it was Alex`s third fish..."
