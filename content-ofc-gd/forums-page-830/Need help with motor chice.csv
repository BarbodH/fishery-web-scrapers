I already have 2 Energizer Marine dual purpose batteries (850 cranking power, 120 Ah). I wonder if 30 or 36 thrust Trolling motor would be enaugh to push my canoe ? Does anyone knows if those batteries have memory (sell person in Walmart could not give an answer)? Can I add charge after every use, or do I have to wait untill they discharged completely ? Does anyone knows 36 lb trust trolling motor equal how many horse power ?   Thanks"

No need to drain them..........BUT.......you have dual purpose batteries. If I was you, I'd take them back and exchange for DEEP CYCLES, that's what you want for your motor.  Sinker"
354183,RuCanBear,2009-06-21 18:29:00,2,"Thank you, Sinker !  I think, I just going to buy new deep cycle battery since I'm using dual purpose also for lights in my tent trailer. Any suggestions for good deep cycle ?"
354188,Sinker,2009-06-21 18:54:00,8692,"In my experience, they're all good. Just keep them charged all the time, even if you only use them briefly, it doesn't hurt to charge them up.  S."
