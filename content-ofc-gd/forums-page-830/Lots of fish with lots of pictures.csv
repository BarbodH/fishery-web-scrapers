If you book an appointment with Lloyd make sure you are on time because he leaves the harbour right on the dot.   Morning sunrise shot  We had some slow times because the fish were scattered all over and no particular pattern was working, it was all trial an error.  Spot A where he did really well the previous outting didn't produce because the fish had moved of course so we went to spot B and got a few and after that it was run and gun to all the possible locations where the fish might hold and what did yah know.  This guy sure knows his water when it comes to the big lake.  As for what happened on the boat and how many fish we boated I'll let the pictures speak for themselves...   Workwear with the first fish on   Not sure who's more tired Workwear or the fish   Captain Lloyd Daume netting the Rainbow Trout   He makes it look so easy   Workwear with a big smile   Deeship getting a piece of the action next"

His contact number is 905-375-0177. All you need is your camera, sunscreen and pack a small lunch and he'll take care of the rest.  He will even clean your catch too..."
