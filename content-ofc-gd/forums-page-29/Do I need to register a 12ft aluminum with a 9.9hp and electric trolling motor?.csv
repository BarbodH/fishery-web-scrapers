1062780,Luxmanfan,2020-06-04 00:55:00,1,"Hi Everyone, New to the board and love it! Got a quick question. Just bought a 12ft aluminum boat with a 9.9 Merc and 30lb electric trolling motor. I am under the impression that I don't need to register the boat due to being less than 10hp. Does the electric trolling motor change anything? Hoping the horsepower restriction is not cumulative with an electric motor.   	Any opinions? Thx in advance."
1062782,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-04 01:15:00,720,"I believe you are right. Under 9.9hp, no hull #'s required. But you will need a powerboat operators card."
1062786,DRIFTER_016,2020-06-04 02:54:00,10439,Nope
1062826,Woodsman,2020-06-05 01:10:00,1286,I never heard of anyone one being charged for that combination but I believe technically the combined power of both motors may put you over the power limit.
1062837,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-05 11:18:00,720,"But both motors would not be used at the same time, can they really use that? Many people dont know what pounds of thrust equates to in HP, so I cant see how that could be reasonably applied."
1062838,NAW,2020-06-05 11:41:00,4022,I drove my 9.9 with my trolling motor in the water at the same time....  It was detrimental.   
1062889,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-06 12:29:00,720,"Ouch, forgot it was down huh? I've done it..fortunately caught it in time"
1062890,bigcreekdad,2020-06-06 12:37:00,546,"Doesn't apply to you, but in Michigan last year I got a $135 fine as I didn't have my 12' drift boat registered....by adding an electric trolling motor (all of 40lb thrust) it was now a ""power boat"". Sounds like Ontario looks at things a bit more reasonably."
1062895,Woodsman,2020-06-06 16:03:00,1286,bigcreekdad in Canada adding a electric trolling motor also makes it a power boat. Just not all power boats require being registered. But you still need a PCOC to operate a small boat with an electric motor.
1062903,dave524,2020-06-06 18:19:00,4508,Makes as much sense as requiring a motorcycle license to run an E-bike ☹️
1062909,Woodsman,2020-06-06 19:50:00,1286,It is what it is. I didn't make the law. 
1062925,Chris J,2020-06-07 13:54:00,44,"Back in the day we used to change cowlings to avoid this.  15hP WERE 9.9 ETC.  But as other poster pointed out, no you don't need to register a 9.9."
