Just need to hook something that swims  The excuse of ""fishies are not out playing yet"" is getting old  Thanks!"
1062936,Rizzo,2020-06-07 17:04:00,4754,Been many years since I fished anywhere around Toronto but when I was a kid we would fish Grenadier pond in High Park. As a teen I worked on Centre Island and the waterways around Centreville were loaded with sunfish and other worm eating species. If Centreville ever opens again you can kill 2 birds with one stone! A bit of fishing and ride the kiddy rides
1062950,Weeds,2020-06-08 00:40:00,782,Rouge river used to be sure thing for small catfish. I think I recall my buddy catching a white/silver bass there. This is going back 20 years so it might not be what it once was.
1062974,David Chong,2020-06-08 18:01:00,836,"Grenadier Pond in High Park & Catfish Pond located to the west of it were my favourite haunts growing up in the west end of Toronto. Great spots although the so-called ""Friends of High Park"" have managed to limit the fishing access on Grenadier Pond! In Grenadier Pond there are Sunfish, Yellow Perch, Black Crappies, Common Carp, Brown Bullheads, Northern Pike & Largemouth Bass! In Catfish Pond, there are Sunfish, Brown Bullheads, Largemouth Bass, Common Carp, Mirror Carp & Wild Goldfish. Good luck!"
