1062707,Raycaster,2020-06-02 20:04:00,528,Took cowling off to perform maintenance stuff on (new to me) engine. After oil change etc. I notice 2 wire on front of engine unattached. I get all wires are not needed but these 2 had connector ends (female and male) and looked worn and previously connected together. Common sense says they belong together but without the manual I don't want to screw anything up Until I can hunt down a manual I thought I'd post some pics here if maybe someone has the same engine or has worked on one. The wires are BROWN and DARK BROWN. Thx ahead.

1062709,Raycaster,2020-06-02 21:06:00,528,"Yes, well I did listen to 90% of the members here thinking it was too small. But, I left out a lot of personal info and $$$ direction that in the end was the final decision. Basically, this is way more than hoped for and at the end of the day a 50-60hp option was really light years away. Darn, I was hoping to slip this thread in without anyone noticing! "

1062714,Raycaster,2020-06-03 00:42:00,528,"Thank you for url. The Female connector is BROWN The Male connector is BROWN + WHITE STRIPE They are at front basically right beside each other, as mentioned the connectors are worn and look like they are a prefect fit. "
1062717,grimsbylander,2020-06-03 01:15:00,3016,Nothing to hide! Congratulations on your new purchase. Hope you love it and catch a boat load!
1062748,Raycaster,2020-06-03 18:23:00,528,"Thx grimsbylander! The reason I was inquiring about this possible loose connection was because after all the maintenance the engine would no longer hold idle! I had a great friend try to relax me off the cliff edge and go through the diagnostic checklist. Long story short, either the previous owners gas tank had bad gas (water) or I bought bad gas. Cleaned tank and lines and purring again, happiest boat owner anyone has seen! Now still have to research those 2 connector and replace plugs (strange 18mm size?) but things are looking up."
1062759,Fisherman,2020-06-03 19:40:00,7201,"If you go to the chart, Blue/White and the Green/White are trim up and down..if so equipped.  Some motors will have all the wiring without the option being present."
1062762,Raycaster,2020-06-03 19:59:00,528,The engines trim works perfect. Going by the chart it could be temp sensor stuff (ohiofisherman) if the brown is actually tan. The brown/white is ???. The engine is purring and impeller working strong but I’m still looking. Thx for everyone’s help.
