1062943,pics,2020-06-07 20:58:00,1268,I spend much more at Sail than I do at BPS.. the prices on the BPS site are in American and that kind of turns me off.. Smaller stores still tend to get most of my business..

As for Sail, I've never been in one but last year I did buy some tackle online from them. I was looking to replace a lure that was super productive for me that I lost. Searching on the net for replacements I found them to be discontinued but Sail had some of what I was searching for so I bought them all!!! 😁"

1063046,AKRISONER,2020-06-10 16:06:00,5558,"I owned the house at the corner of dufferin and Rowan avenue for 7 years across from fairbank Park. I wouldn’t call the neighborhood a slum, it’s actually on the up and up, but definitely went through a really rough stretch in the 90’s. the area towards eglington and dufferin and  st clair clair and dufferin has seen a major change in recent years however. I think a lot of the parkdale king and dufferin crowd moved north and parkdale gentrified. There is also now a methadone clinic at the Southwest corner of st clair and dufferin which brings a lot of characters around. the Eglinton problems have somewhat subsided with the cross town construction. The place is a giant disaster so the riff raff have found new haunches to frequent. Fairbank Park itself was great, the police took it upon themselves to keep that park and school safe. When I lived there there was almost a cop conducting “traffic” duty 100% of the time parked in front of the pool. They’d ticket people for illegally turning left off dufferin onto key west. What they truthfully were doing was keeping the dealers and fiends away from the school and park. living in fairbank was great. It was an oasis between two pretty rough spots. I never had any issues at my actual house. The worst was an unlocked bike stolen from my back yard. Nothing more than that. I miss that house a lot sometimes!"

1063129,dave524,2020-06-12 12:00:00,4508,"20 years old article , but the same Bull reporting from the media on firearms issues 😖 . The M1 Garand doesn't use 30 round magazines or any magazine at all but is loaded with 8 only from the top of the receiver , the bottom is solid and FYI it was designed by a Canadian "" John Garand "".  Up until the latest fiasco from the minds of our government were totally unrestricted and bought and sold freely with just a PAL,  not restricted as said.  Does anyone remember  "" Hercules Mil Surplus "" on the east side of Yonge, think they were just above College, bought a great parka there in '69  that lasted my 4 years at UofT.  They had barrels full of milsurps , Lee Enfields were under 30 bucks then 👍"
1063132,lew,2020-06-12 12:28:00,12766,I bought a pair of Bear Paw snowshoes there around 1960
1062799,dave524,2020-06-04 14:06:00,4508,"I miss the Outdoor Stores , I went to the one at QEW and Dixie I think it was,  joy when we got one in an old supermarket at Main and Parkdale in Hamilton. The yuppie Collegiate Sports bought them out , got rid of the nasty firearms ( albeit I did get some great closeout deals ) and it went downhill from there."
1062801,AKRISONER,2020-06-04 15:09:00,5558,"I would also like to point out here that Sail doesnt push an absolute garbage line of Chinese designed/manufactured crap like Bass Pro does. When i first started shopping at bass pro 15ish years ago they had a mixture of their BP private label and then normal brands. As time has moved on they have basically just completely moved away from selling anything but BP branded crap. The stuff is exactly that...crap nock off junk. most noticeable is their terminal tackle selection...you can barely buy anthing except for their junky BP brand stuff now. My best experience was wanting some tungsten drop shot weights and of course the only brand they stocked was their own. I took them out on the lake made one cast and literally every single one of them the swivels immediately failed and broke resulting in me losing the entire package worth of weights. When i went to get a refund with i think 1 weight left in the package the guy tried to question why I wasnt returning the weights with the packaging and I told him that they shouldn't expect their customers to go and pick up their faulty product that naturally ended up on the bottom of a lake. The best shop in the GTA right now is Pro J. I find the guy at Gangons to be unhelpful and somewhat rude as if they are only intersted in helping out the guys that they know. Thats just my experience...they have a decent selection of stuff and their pricing is solid, but I personally prefer to shop at Pro J. Phoebe at Pro J (spelling) is the man, knows his stuff and is always willing to help you find or even order in anything that you need. Their pricing is literally as low as you will find anywhere."
1062802,porkpie,2020-06-04 15:25:00,2521,"I'm sorry to see that they are in trouble.  I don't spend much there in the way of fishing as I shop pretty exclusively at Kingsway down in Guelph, but Sail is one of the options that  I will go to for hunting products or if I want a firearm.  I just picked up a shotgun from Lake Huron rod and gun and it turns out they are going out of business.  That's a real loss.  I've never had much luck with BPS or Cabelas.   They rarely have what I want in the hunting department.  Elwood Epps is a good store to stop at also when I'm heading to the cottage.  Sail is a good option for hunters and fishermen, although I think there are enough small tackle shops out there that as long as you live in the area you should be supporting them as long as they have good service.  But for hunters, the options are dwindling!"
1062803,David Chong,2020-06-04 16:08:00,836,Looks like their restructuring is going to involve the closing of their 4 Sportium stores in Quebec which has always been a burden from the moment they bought them! Also they will be closing the Vaughan and Etobicoke locations in Ontario leaving them with 4 locations in Ontario & 8 in Quebec! Hopefully this will allow them to focus on their profitable locations and continue on!
1062804,David Chong,2020-06-04 16:14:00,836,In my youth I worked at the Outdoor Stores in the old Birk's store at Yonge & Temperance! Fun times and great stores! Yup as soon as Collegiate bought them it went downhill but I was no longer there after that! LOL
1062806,misfish,2020-06-04 17:06:00,29133,"There was one off Dufferin, just north of Eglington. My pop loved that store. We always tagged along. In Brampton there was one as well. I believe Pat Mahoney family ran it. Great people they were. I can remember spending half a pay check on that place each week. Fridays were get fishing gear, take the family to the Ponderosa restaurant right next store, to make up for the weekend I would be fishing ..  LOL"
1062807,lew,2020-06-04 17:30:00,12766,There was another Outdoor Store on the Danforth and although it was small they carried alot of stuff and I bought a set of golf clubs there many years ago. There was also a Collegiate Sports not too far away at Warden & St.Clair and I used to like wandering around there but I think the only thing I ever bought was a pair of Kodiak boots. Nice store but they didn't last too long at that location.
1062808,dave524,2020-06-04 18:07:00,4508,"Dating myself , but going to U of T 69/74 just below Bloor on Yonge, there was Skinner's Sporting Goods on 1 side of Yonge and virtually across from it was Hallam's Gun Store, I recall getting a brand new 22-250 Remington varmint rifle there, putting it in a case and getting on the subway 🤣. Skinner's later moved down on Adelaide just east of Yonge in what was an old bank building and Hallams went to a strip mall, think they had an indoor range there."
1062811,Headhunter,2020-06-04 19:10:00,5703,"Glad they're keeping the Shwa store open. I usually go to Gagnon's first, then get whatever else I ""need"" at Sail.

1062710,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-02 21:43:00,720,it’s a shame see a Canadian company like this  suffering against Bass Pro shops and Cabela’s. I hope they can survive. Their pricing is always been more expensive and a lot of their products are too elitist. (Clothes) I’d like to see them work on their strategies so they can become more competitive
1062715,big guy,2020-06-03 00:49:00,414,"Was just there last week. They need to lower their prices and employ people who care about the sports they are selling. Everything we bought across the highway at Gagnons, from rods to lures was cheaper than at Sail. Gagnons is one family owned store and if they can out compete a chain there is something wrong. The service at Gagnons is also great, guys at the Sail don't even know what a Shad Dancer is."
1062718,John Bacon,2020-06-03 01:28:00,3277,"I don't really shop there for clothes, but I find their fishing gear to be reasonably priced.  I also find their staff to be quite knowable, especially for a large chain store.  	I hope that they manage to pull through."
1062721,GregF2,2020-06-03 11:19:00,46,"That is too bad, as I really like Sail.  Really like their clothes selection too, as they have some great brands that can be hard to find in stores."
1062722,Yellow Fever,2020-06-03 11:40:00,139,"Disappointing news, I'm not a price buyer,if they have what i need i buy. Always found the Sail fishing staff in a group hanging around the counter and rarley on the floor. Gagnons has the same issue sometimes,  i have been a Gagnons customer for a whole lot of years and in fact was a competitor of theirs back in the 70s in Oshawa. It is a tough business."
1062723,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-03 11:41:00,720,"I'd like to see them take on a BPS approach by adding marine accessories, motors, boats etc. At least I'd rather see them be able to compete with BPS and expand where BPS isnt, but I guess thats not on the table. One thing that really pi**ed me off about this covid thing is that Marks, CT, Home hardware and many other stores had to close and do /online and curbside, where walmart could operate business as usual because they were ""grocery"". They should have had to close off everything non-grocery. The Canadian comapnies take a another hit while a huge US corp racks up the profit. We need more protection of our valued Canadian chains and corporations.  rant off good luck Sail, I'd quite like to see you survive"
1062725,gordy28,2020-06-03 12:18:00,638,I am a Sail fan and hope they can pull through When I was shopping for kayaks for my daughter and I we had awesome help at both the Etobicoke and Burlington stores I also find their combo of camping gear and fishing gear is second to no one near me Andrew 
1062728,AKRISONER,2020-06-03 13:11:00,5558,"IMO sail should ditch the ""outdoor apparel"" part of the business. It always seems huge with no one actually shopping in that section. Focus on the fishing and hunting stuff. I much prefer sail over bass pro or cabellas. Always has knowledgeable staff too."
1062729,mitch seguin,2020-06-03 13:36:00,98,I could not disagree more with your findings.  Totally opposite of my experiences and I buy at both locations but most of my $$$ go to Sail.
1062732,David Chong,2020-06-03 14:02:00,836,Sad to see but hopefully whatever their restructuring plans are work! Competition is good for the consumer! Fingers crossed that they make it!
1062735,LeXXington,2020-06-03 14:31:00,1928,"Said it here a few times when discussing the local stores..  Sail expanded the business very fast. In the GTA way too many stores, competing against the same customers.  Having a store close to Basspro destined to fail? The idea was great but the writing was on the wall years ago. Service was top notch because a large open store (2 floors) but foot traffic was limited.  More employee's sometimes than customers. Not sure of the future but expect a bunch of GTA stores to close and consolidate.  Covid was just another nail in an old coffin.  "
1062737,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-03 15:04:00,720,"I think the era of shopping malls, big box stores and what not maybe coming to an end. This might be the shift into online ordering and robotic deliveries."
1062740,Fisherman,2020-06-03 15:39:00,7201,"You may be right about the online ordering but for some stuff, I still want to handle things before I buy.  Junk would just have to be sent back ending up costing more for shipping.   I really believe they didn't think their process through all the way, a couple Km from another well established big box store, you might get 1/2 the customers if things really went well.   Their on line version is pretty dismal to say the least,  heck LeB albeit old style was still better.  Local would have been better around Newmarket."
1062741,Yellow Fever,2020-06-03 15:57:00,139,"I worked in the industry...in a lot of cases the outdoor apparel is where the biv margins are,def not on fishing tackle"
1062744,misfish,2020-06-03 17:08:00,29133,"On another note  Walmart is ditching the oil and lube and tire installation part of their business. Many jobs gone now. I can not say I would take my Ram there for an oil change or tires, but it is another closing and lost of jobs.  As for Sail I would hit that place way before BPS. I never found their prices over priced. Well not for what I was looking for and they had what I wanted, when I would go there. Like said by many,their staff are top notch . I can openly say the opposite for BPS. Many are there for just a job. Why have a person working in a section that they have no idea .  Sail does have to many stores,thats a given. Which ones they will close will be up to them. I like the idea of the one down the road from BPS. Got to keep them honest.  Cabelas here is well,way over priced and I can buy cheaper at Sail. Once this 19 is over,I hope Sail is open when I can finally get back down to my meat factory and do some good food shopping."
1062745,canoecarrier,2020-06-03 17:37:00,54,"They have screwed a lot of customers over out of very expensive products with refunds and warranties and so on. They got me a couple of times for high dollar items, sometimes you have to learn the hard way. It may be a Canadian company but I believe its based out of Quebec, which we generally have a hard time with anyways.  Support the mom and pop and small businesses out there, they actually know about their products! Why are these companies allowed to use government handouts just to postpone the inevitable? The last company that did this, is now in Mexico! Sounds to me like they are ripping us off."
1062747,AKRISONER,2020-06-03 18:03:00,5558,"It sure seems like the sail locations in quebec are far less frequented than the stores here in the GTA. you can really tell when you look at the stock availability of items, it seems like a few of the Quebec stores have everything in stock all of the time because they never sell anything lol. like mid fish said, the one thing I appreciate about sail the most is that if I go and ask for a very specific thing, the workers in the fishing section always know either A) exactly what I am talking about or  B: have a general idea and will either ask someone who does know or take me to the right section and help me look for that very specific thing. last time I went to bass pro reluctantly I was looking for some ice fishing buckshot jigs and the girl working in the fishing section didn’t know what I was talking about when I dumbed it down and simply asked if she knew where I could find ice fishing jigs."
1062772,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-03 21:58:00,720,"Many jobs from Walmart gone, but gone elsewhere. I don't think people trust Walmart for automotive service or auto products. They’re a step down from C.T. The demand for these services didn’t change. People just go elsewhere for it. And I’m all for it if Wallymart loses business to local shops, dealers or Canadian Tire. The way I see it anyway. YMMV"
1062774,spooner_jr,2020-06-03 22:28:00,193,"Sail's pricing is very competitive for guns and ammo, better than Cabela's and CT in my experience."
1062776,big guy,2020-06-03 23:42:00,414,"Good for you, to each his own. Ive looked at rods at sail many times and not once had staff come to ask me if i needed help, like a poster already said, always hanging around the desk. I am a fan of sail, always liked the stores, but they need to restructure their business if they want to compete."
1062785,captpierre,2020-06-04 01:58:00,2521,I like Sail but have often thought they won’t make it.   The cost of running a big store is ridiculous and they’d need to be busy  to be profitable. I’ve rarely seen a line up to check out.   I’m not surprised that they are in trouble.
1062791,Hack_Fisherman,2020-06-04 10:49:00,720,"I've notced that too. But I've never seen a line at BPS either. Might be just the times I've been, but it also makes me wonder if BPS and Cabela's are suffering too. Surely BPS' overhead has to be as high if not more?"
1062792,woodenboater,2020-06-04 10:55:00,2277,"now more than ever, I really miss LeBarons. Was never a fun time shopping at BPS, and preferred Cabelas instead tbh. I liked Sail, but agree that the stores are HUUUGE and perhaps they could have trimmed down a few GTA locations, and probably will. Hope the can recover."
1062797,crappieperchhunter,2020-06-04 13:29:00,2582,Have always liked the sail in Oshawa but only with regards to the fishing section as I have purchased almost nothing there except fishing related stuff. The fishing staff there have always been helpful to me. Two years ago I got a rapala electric knife from them and it died before the 1 year warranty was up.  The warranty stated that the knife be returned to Rapala not Sail. But they said they would take care of it for me and took my knife and replaced it with a new one free of charge. I hope they get through this. You can never have too many options for supplying us with our outdoors stuff.
