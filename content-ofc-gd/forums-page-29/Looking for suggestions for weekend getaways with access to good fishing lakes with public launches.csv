So my wife and I are looking for ideas on where we can go fishing for a weekend and simply stay in a motel or lodge for one or two nights. (Even this may not be possible) Her criteria; motel accommodations that are decent enough where you don’t feel you have to sleep on the dresser, or on top of the covers with your clothes and shoes on and semi decent restaurant(s) in the area. my criteria; somewhat close to quieter, productive lakes with a boat launch and parking (public or paid access) We’re in the Guelph Waterloo area, so prefer not to go too far past Sudbury, North Bay or Beyond Ottawa. Open to the Bruce Peninsula also. No big water please Pm me if you want to keep your suggestions quiet. Thanks in advance."
