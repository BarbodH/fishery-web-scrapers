1062116,David Chong,2020-05-21 17:01:00,836,"Join me for a FREE Navionics webinar next Tues. May 26, 2020 at 7:00 PM EDT where we'll going to be talking about probably my favourite way to catch bass, on topwater! Great time to be learning more and we'll try to cover as much as possible about ""Hardbody Topwater Bassin'!"" as possible, if you have any questions in particular, please comment on this post and I'll try to answer them. But leading up to it, here is a pop quiz : How different modifications can you spot on the popper with this post? You can register for the webinar at:Â https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/6470295383013328909?source=David+ChongÂ And again totally FREE! "
1062119,misfish,2020-05-21 18:32:00,29133,"Front hook replaced with a ex caliber red treble. Back has a red thread wrap that is holding a white saddle hackle with pearl crystal flash . If it was repainted,I would have no idea,as so many are out there.  Do I win the popper ?  LOL"
1062125,OhioFisherman,2020-05-21 20:40:00,6623,Looks like a tail weight? suspend strip? Hardwater Topwater Bassin'! ? water should be soft for surface lures?
1062126,misfish,2020-05-21 20:43:00,29133,Did not see that. Now I do. Good eye Paul.
1062127,David Chong,2020-05-21 21:15:00,836,You got a couple of the mods! Might hold a contest during the webinar!
1062128,David Chong,2020-05-21 21:17:00,836,Bingo! That's another one! LOL Still have ice fishing on my mind!
1062130,OhioFisherman,2020-05-21 21:37:00,6623,The hooks look like Mustad triple grips to me. 
1062131,misfish,2020-05-21 21:48:00,29133,They are a short shank.
1062142,grimsbylander,2020-05-22 04:39:00,3016,Years ago I used to pinch a small Blackbird split shot on the shank of the rear treble to get it pointing down at rest. Increased hook ups dramatically. The other thing was using a dremel tool to hollow out the cup on the nose end to deepen and sharpen the edges. The bait WILLÂ really pop and gurgle with very littleÂ movement afterwards. Gbay smallies love popRâ€™s ðŸ˜‰
1062158,Headhunter,2020-05-22 17:31:00,5703,Is the split ring at the front an add on? HH
1062159,David Chong,2020-05-22 17:57:00,836,In this case it was! Some poppers do come with a split ring!
1062324,David Chong,2020-05-25 21:23:00,836,So in the case of this what was originally a Bulldog Popper (They're no longer around) The 5 mods made to this lure were: 1/ Replaced the original rear trailer with a Short Shank Wide Gap treble with longer feathers and crystal flash in it! 2/ Added Suspend Strips to the rear section so that the bait would sit tail down at rest. 3/ Replaced the frontÂ treble with an up-sized wide gap Red treble. 4/ Painted the mouth red for higher visibility. 5/ Added a split ring so the bait would have more action.
1062779,Snidley,2020-06-04 00:46:00,620,"Instead of anÂ  ""O"" ring as a line tie I usually prefer a clip or even better a Rapala loop knot tied direct to the lure. I find you get a louder gurgle when walking the dog at low speed or a bigger splash when aggressively popping the bait. I also really like the Sure Set hooks on the back of all topwaters not just poppers. I've never seen Sure Sets with feather tails but I make my own feather tail using Swan feathers that I pick up in the spring and fall when they molt."

1062892,OhioFisherman,2020-06-06 14:13:00,6623,"Thanks for putting it on youtube, thought it was very good."
1062897,Snidley,2020-06-06 17:04:00,620,Hey David. What is that connector on the Lucky Craft popper? It looks similar to the connector on a Kwikfish
1062898,David Chong,2020-06-06 17:14:00,836,"It is a Fastach from Stringease! Twist on, no snap to open!"
1062935,OhioFisherman,2020-06-07 16:20:00,6623,"I believe Mustad bought Stringease some years back, Kevin Van Damm was a big promoter of them."
1062947,David Chong,2020-06-07 23:18:00,836," Stringease licensed some of their product to Mustad! Yes, KVD is a big fan of the product!"
