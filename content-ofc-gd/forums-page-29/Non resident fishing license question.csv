1062565,Coach 49,2020-05-30 14:45:00,2,"My group and I have been fishing in Canada for over 30 years, 21 at Nagagami lake outside Hornepayne. We've always gone up the third week of June..Of course, that's be cancelled.  We now are going up the first week of September. A few in the group already purchased an 8 day license for the original dates. Question.  Will Ontario honor those licenses in Sept., or will my friends have to purchase new licenses?  "
1062589,jjcanoe,2020-05-31 00:10:00,744,"Probably will be able to change them, but check with the licencing site to be sure. Wasn't aware you could pre plan the days you fished, when buying a non resident licence. Alway thought the 8 days started the day after you bought it. I get one for a relative who visits every few years and that was the case 5 years ago. Looks like that has changed?"
1062590,David Chong,2020-05-31 01:07:00,836,Don't see why they wouldn't adjust the dates! But it is government so you never know! LOL Good luck!
1062591,grimsbylander,2020-05-31 01:22:00,3016,Let me know if they move the dates. I buy a non resident NY State Licence every year and didn’t get to use mine either!  	I won’t hold my breath!
1062600,Coach 49,2020-05-31 11:42:00,2,Thanks for the answers.  My buddy has been trying to find out but with no success.  I'll let you all know the outcome.
