The guys who I bought it from bought it from another guy without any papers. The person who I bought it from knew nothing about the previous owner. He was going to fix it up, but got too busy.  	Now at the time I was worried that maybe it was stolen or something. I bought 3 different reports of the boat and everything came back CLEAN. Seeing how I don’t have a bill of sale or ownership or anything how do I go about licensing/registering the boat in my name? It does have numbers displayed agains the hull (licensing numbers) so I guess it was licensed before. I don’t know who it was licensed to. If anyone has any experience with this or could help my that would be tremendously helpful! Thanks in advance Andrew B."
