While I love fishing for walleye and look forward to the season opener with great anticipation it does not mean I sit and stare longingly at the open water for three weeks. Bass, Pike and crappie are open all year here and its not long after the last iceberg has been pushed to shore that I head out. Love the spring action, even though the pike were a bit conspicuous by there absence, well the big girls anyway.  "
