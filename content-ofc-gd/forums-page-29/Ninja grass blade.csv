For the weeds we went through I can say it worked quite well. Cabbage, coontail and lilies usually aren't too bad anyway and the video Ohio posted sure looked after reeds. The only criticism I had of owning one is on the owner, not the blade! Because it went through weeds so well, he had a tendency to plow through to get back into the thick stuff and expect fish to sit in 12"" of water while the thing choppedÂ salad. It's NOT quiet! Old fashioned pull poles are work but don't scatter the fish and shut them down. It was nice coming out though. If you get one, let's us know how it goes."
