1063003,AKRISONER,2020-06-09 15:28:00,5558,not me but my best buddies were catching them easy in the tri lakes. That heat wave after the snow really really screwed everything up everywhere it seems. Had the fishing tough across the province from what I can tell. Things are shaping up nicely now though and im seeing more catches.
