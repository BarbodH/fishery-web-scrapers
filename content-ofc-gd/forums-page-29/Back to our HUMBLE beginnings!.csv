I managed to get back to something that I have not done for probably decades and that was to fish out of a canoe! A truly peaceful and serene day on the water, at least it was until the fish started to bite! As much as the roar of Yamaha 250 excite me, there is definitely something to be said about stealthily paddling around in a canoe. It was a memorable day with some beautiful fish and great company with good friend, Wil Wegman. BTW never mind the delicious fish afterwards!    "
1062886,Terry,2020-06-06 11:39:00,14456,Nice
1062887,aplumma,2020-06-06 12:05:00,6896,Looks like a good day of fishing and fun. Good job. Art
1062893,misfish,2020-06-06 14:20:00,29133,I see you brought your teacher. LOL  Nice outing David.
1062896,Weeds,2020-06-06 16:39:00,782,Awesome. I don’t know why I’ve never put in the time to learn how and where to fish for trout. I have the canoe part. Got to get off my butt I guess.
1062915,captpierre,2020-06-06 23:08:00,2521,Nice. Are those speckies or splake?
1062916,David Chong,2020-06-07 00:17:00,836,Brook (Speckled) Trout!
1062917,grimsbylander,2020-06-07 00:31:00,3016,Congrats on a great day. Beautiful fish and scenery too.  	That’s a lot of fishing knowledge in one canoe. 👍🏻
1062928,limeyangler,2020-06-07 14:17:00,5204,"That looks amazing, i am a wuss, I find canoe fishing extremely uncomfortable, nothing that a bit more discipline and self care would not fix though."
1062937,Rizzo,2020-06-07 17:06:00,4754,now that looks fun!
1062964,Chuck Enwinde,2020-06-08 03:52:00,247,You're right about that. I bet Wil showed him the spot though.  lol.
