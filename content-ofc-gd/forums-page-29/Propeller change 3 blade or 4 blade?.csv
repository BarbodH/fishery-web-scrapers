1062221,LeXXington,2020-05-24 01:29:00,1928,"Finally got the boat out on the water.  Results are increased my speed by 3 mph.   I like the handling at speed,   So far happy with the reults"
1062292,John Bacon,2020-05-25 02:33:00,3277,"That's interesting, you gained speed with a four bladed prop. "
1062296,Garnet,2020-05-25 10:15:00,2056,Generally that wouldn't be the case. It's possible the 3 blade was blowing out small amounts. A prop ring might solve that. In most fishing worlds we carry more and more gear so 4 blade will be better.
1062360,LeXXington,2020-05-26 15:08:00,1928,Only thing I can think of is the original prop was undersized on the pitch.
1062503,Freshtrax,2020-05-29 17:24:00,2215,Likely less pro slip with the 4 blade seeing they are the same pitch.   Also the cupping on that prop does give some sern lift so less drag...   props = witchcraft sometimes.   Glad it worked .
1057483,Garnet,2020-03-18 11:39:00,2056,If it's just hole shot you can plug vent holes on your prop. The kit is $10.  And if you experience blow out a prop ring might help. Basically a rubber band fits on prop.
1058557,Grangb2,2020-04-01 16:29:00,4,"Hey gang, this is a great discussion and I appreciate all the input on something I know nothing about. I am interested in your opinions on my situation. I will preface by saying some of the terms being used here are not familiar to me, so I won't use the terminology that most of you are, and if you could keep it simple for me that would be great. I have a 2009 16' Lund Rebel XL SS. 50HP Merc. I bought it used and it came with a 4 blade on. I also have the original 3 blade, and I have always wondered if for my usage, I should switch back to the 3 blade? 75+% of my usage is on Lake O/E downrigging. So... run out to where I want to fish as quickly as I can, troll all day and then run back in to the launch. Not usually at full speed given there's usually too much chop on Erie to open it up. Usually have myself and one other person with me, have 2 downriggers- weight wise I would say medium... I'm not loaded down to full capacity at all. Performance-wise, I think its good, but I have nothing to compare to. My only complaints/issues are: 1) Its sometimes challenging to get the trolling speed quite as low as I want to in the spring. I am often shifting weight in the boat to try to get it down another 1-2 tenths of a mph, and 2) At top speed on flat water, it  does cavitate occasionally when turning sharply. This isn't a big deal or anything as I know when it will happen and I adjust to avoid it, but I'm not thinking I should have to? So... there you go, thoughts? Should I leave the 4 blade on, or switch to the 3 blade? And for either one, why? Thanks in advance for any help!"
1058564,John Bacon,2020-04-01 16:49:00,3277,It's not that hard to switch props.  Why not just switch it out and see how each one performs and then go with the one that you prefer.
1058579,BillM,2020-04-01 18:09:00,17367,"Switch them out, takes 5 mins."
1058583,RangerGuy,2020-04-01 18:44:00,564,"I am running a 2019 Alumacraft Competitor 205 Tiller that has a 115hp VMAX SHO. I switched the standard yamaha 3 blade 17p aluminum to a 15p 4 blade Mercury Nemesis Aluminum. To be honest I haven't lost any speed, 37-39 mph in the right conditions. I experienced a better hole shot and handling. These are not a overly expensive prop and hub kit to try  "
1058599,Grangb2,2020-04-01 19:25:00,4,"Thanks for the quick feedback. I know I can switch it out and test. And no, switching isn't a big deal, but I guess what I was looking for was expertise on if the 3 blade would be expected to help or hinder my two issues. I don't get out on the water very often, so figured there was no need to bother with it if conceptually it was obvious I would be going in the wrong direction."
1058610,Garnet,2020-04-01 20:46:00,2056,it takes work to get a boat propped correctly. 
1058619,John Bacon,2020-04-01 21:52:00,3277,"No amount of expertise is better than an actual on water test.  	If I was thinking of buying a prop, I would seek advise.  If I already had the other prop I would just try it out and get actual results. "
1058643,LeXXington,2020-04-02 02:43:00,1928,From all the things I read a 4 blade prop pushes you more in lower RPM.   I would try both and see what works for you. I think the 3 blade prob might be better to go rigging with .
1058649,Garnet,2020-04-02 11:29:00,2056,"You can think of blades on prop as grip, 3 blade less grip little faster, 4 blade more grip slightly less speed ,5 way more grip than 3 . What will grip do for you . For hole shot more grip will get you on plane quicker but you can over do it and bog motor. When on plane like erie and Ont that grip will help when you need to go (mountain of water). If your prop blows on holeshot it will defiantly blowout in big waves. I don't know 50 hp market all my experience is 150 up . to prop a boat you need your standard load 2 people downriggers  drink cooler rods tackle everything that you take on lake. Then you need good holeshot and at max throttle to be just under the max rpm for your motor. If you have it right you can never over drive your motor. "
1061672,John Bacon,2020-05-12 03:15:00,3277,"I got an email today because I was using the sizing app they have on their site.  They said that three blade props perform better for motors under 120 hp.  According to them the better hole shot etc., from four blades only applies to motors over 120 hp.  	I also have a 16' boat with a 50 hp Merc.  So, I am interested in hearing how your boat performs with the two different props."
1061673,Freshtrax,2020-05-12 04:14:00,2215,I put a 4 blade on our underpowered 60hp legend 16ft and was night and day difference.    Same  on our underpowered 20ft legend 115hp   stays on plane at much lower rpm and much better holeshot.   Beware around docks your first time with a 4 blade reverse is different.
1061674,sauce,2020-05-12 07:30:00,219,"Don't get too caught up with # of blades. Find the prop that allows your motor to reach ""peak"" RPM at WOT. Whether it be 3 4 or 5 blade. Pitch and # of blades will change hole shot, stability and top end speed to slightly different degrees. Your motor and hull will influence each other differently day to day based on weight distribution and wave conditions. When you are out of the RPM range you'll notice one day your 3 blade will feel perfect but the next it will feel like it's pushing water and not moving the boat like it should. If you are under powered or over propped you will really notice when trying to maintain cruising speed in chop. But I don't think your rig is under powered. I went down from 3 blade 17 pitch to a 15 pitch for my 40 HP etec tiller. Hole shot is now truly amazing. I'm on plane and cruising at 25MPH in under 10 seconds even in chop.  Top end speed at WOT is 2 mph lower than before but  RPM is right where it should be for peak HP.  I can back the throttle from max RPM to about 90% and cruise 2mph under my max speed. The extra 300 RPM I gained by dropping from 17 to 15 makes a world of difference when running close to top RPM. Before I could reach 31mph but only hitting 5400 RPM on flat water, I could never even get close to WOT in any kind of chop.  Now I max out at 29mph at 5700. And I can maintain that pace in chop no problem. 5400RPM gives me about 27MPh and 5000 around 25mph in most conditions.  So I generally cruise at 25MPH around 5000RPM and maintain tight handling and instant throttle response.  5000 would just get me over 25MPH on flat water before I switched. 5000 in chop wouldn't quite get to 25MPH and it was actually scary to hold onto the tiller arm LOL. Now a full tank lasts forever and the engine never works hard, even when loaded and running at WOT.  Now all 40 HP is available. How much of my 40 was I getting with the 17 pitch?? Main thing is no matter which prop you choose, make sure that you are in the recommended range for RPM at WOT. If you aren't able to get to peak RPM at WOT then anything else is an experiment that makes your engine work harder and burn more gas. You would probably get the all around performance boost you are looking for by dropping down a pitch.  Unless you are already hitting peak RPM. But I have a feeling you aren't. A 90 that's over propped wont be able to achieve 100% of it's HP. A properly propped 90 will have all of it's power available all the time. Tiny increments in throttle will push you further back in your seat and make your passengers giggle. Maybe your rig is set up near perfect and you are just striving for the ultimate sweet spot. I hope you keep this thread updated with your impression of any changes you make.  Hopefully you find that sweet spot."
1061770,tomkat,2020-05-13 22:17:00,246,A lot of tiller guys like 4 blade. They supposedly work well with stern heavy boats. I have a fibreglass ranger tiller with a 50 Yamaha running a 12 pitch 3 blade which works well it gives me 32 mph at 5800 rpm. I am going to try the same prop in a 4 blade 11 pitch to see how I like it. With me at 200 lbs plus 3 batteries and the fuel tank in the back I think the 4 blade might be nice. They recommend dropping in pitch when going to 4 blade to maintain your same rpm. Plus I like tinkering with stuff lol!
1061805,Lape0019,2020-05-14 16:48:00,647,"I think you’ve got a handle on this already but here is my experience. went from a 24p raker HO to a 24p Raker RX4. Obviously not a merc but this is what I found. The RX4 has been a great prop for me.  	It lowered my RPM by about 200 (still raising the motor slowly to get its optimal performance), hole shot is faster and smoother, handling in turns is improved and no slip whatsoever. I haven’t lost any top speed  but I think that has more to do with me not getting everything out of the 3 blade than it has to do with anything else. Plus, I’ve raised the motor by about 1” so far and still plan on going higher"
1061879,BillM,2020-05-15 18:07:00,17367,"4 Blade was great for the hole shot but I lost 3-4mph on my top end.  Turn in was good, a lot more bite then the 3 blade I had on there.   Currently running a 3 blade stainless.  Best of both worlds if you ask me."
1061972,John Bacon,2020-05-17 18:27:00,3277,"Interesting.  I have 13"" pitch on my Mercury 50hp.  Perhaps the E-tecs run lower RPMs or have a lower gear ratio at the lower end so they run a higher pitch prop at lower RMPs."
1061977,tomkat,2020-05-17 22:03:00,246,I would have thought 15 pitch on a 40hp would be much too high also. I once had a Lund explorer with a 50hp mariner that came with a 14 pitch and I could only get about 5000 rpm. I dropped to a 12 pitch and it was perfect. But mine was a 4 stroke . With that boat I didn’t lose any top end speed it just got there much quicker.
1061988,sauce,2020-05-18 01:51:00,219,"With the 17, I was able to get RPM to just over 5400 tilted to the verge of porpoising. Recommended RPM for my engine is 5700-6000. Switched to 15 and I'm maxing out around 5750. I can really feel a difference when I'm cruising at 5000 and open it up all the way.  Fun! I had it out on Wednesday. Found out I can plane out at 15 and then cruise at 12.  2500 RPM. Getting my RPM closer to the recommended range definitely improved my motors overall performance."
1061995,Garnet,2020-05-18 11:35:00,2056,Getting your boat prop right is defiantly worth the effort.
1062003,Fisherman,2020-05-18 15:08:00,7201,"After reading the above, I started with a 10x17P  3 blade on a F40 tiller Yamaha/16' Princecraft.  Couldn't get it above 4800rpm.  Down to an 11 1/8 x 13P and got to about 5300rpm,  dropped it to 10 5/8 x 12P, now it will get to 58-5900 rpm without any struggle.  These are aluminum OEM."
1062022,LeXXington,2020-05-19 00:34:00,1928,Got the 4 blade prop from Freshtrax (thanks) just little P.O &##%^^&^& that all local Boat Ramps are still closed!  Hope they open them up this week. Sucks that the closest boat ramp is over 1.5 hours away right now.

1057394,LeXXington,2020-03-16 16:08:00,1928,"Hi All: So after many hours of use I need to change my prop. Nothing bad with the old one just a few chips from floating debris. When choosing yes I could buy the same model, pitch, etc but I was thinking of going to a 4 blade. Reasons. Lower speed plane, quicker hole shot stability.  I am less in the speed and more for stability.  Just wondering if any one has changed to a 4 blade prop or has one.  Your experience? Gone through a few prop selector sites but they don't even recommend the prop that came with my boat any suggestions how to select the right size. Thanks   "
1057396,Terry,2020-03-16 16:49:00,14456,"Yup 4 blade gives a more stable ride but a little less top end.   	but it’s more important to pick the right prop for your motor , your boat and the weight you carry on the boat"
1057400,Fisherman,2020-03-16 19:08:00,7201,"Maybe I'm not looking at it in the same perspective, but what is the big hang up with holeshot?  Is it the look at me I can launch this tub out of the water or almost like ""rolling coal"".  Pushing the boat out of the water to launch to planning speed must put some extra stress on the transom for sure."
1057403,irishfield,2020-03-16 19:47:00,26272,I have one of each.. lol 
1057405,aplumma,2020-03-16 21:03:00,6896,"Think of it as the difference between a tractor and a car. The 4 blade will move more water meaning heavy loads can be negated so if you load up for camping, pull toys or have 4 adults they make it so you can accelerate to planing speed easier and then back off to get better fuel economy then 4 blades are preferred.  If you run light and are not pulling toys then the 3 blade is preferred  because you can increase top end and also economy by backing off the rpm's. The backing of of the rpm's is tricky because if you have a loaded boat and a 3 bladed prop the amount you can back off is less than if it is a lightly loaded boat. The act of having a blade cupped which accelerates the water off the tip can account for a higher top end as well. The material the prop is made of also affects the pitch needed , the stiffer the material like Stainless Steel  the less flex so the more efficient it is. For my 150 HP I have a 3 blade cupped S.S. prop because usually I have only 2 people in the boat.  Art"
1057412,DRIFTER_016,2020-03-16 22:11:00,10439,"A four blade gives better holeshot, much better in cornering and the top end loss is negligible. At least on my 115 4 stroke. Also I can run my motor higher in the water column with a 4 or 5 blade prop which actually gives me more top end as I don't get slippage and cavitation like I do with my 3 blade props. I currently have my 4 blade on as my 5 blade needed some tuning work done on it. I shipped it to Citywide in November and picked it up when I was down in December. There is a big difference between my 4 blade and my 5 blade when it is tuned right."
1057413,Garnet,2020-03-16 22:26:00,2056,"Dog out of hole, blowing out are all just hard on your engine. The correct prop should plane your boat at max operating weight and top speed should be just below your max rpm. "
1057416,misfish,2020-03-16 23:04:00,29133,"I was going to say a high 5, but unsure the motor Lex has . Had that on my 115 Mariner, 18 ft ranger . It was quick up and planed real nice . RPM at 58 mph was 5000-5300. Motor was humming just nice. Ask Terry, he was on it .LOL"
1057418,DRIFTER_016,2020-03-16 23:18:00,10439,Yeah I have a High 5 on my rig. Nice piece of metal. I got it at an even better price. 
1057422,kickingfrog,2020-03-17 00:26:00,8333,The only outboard I saw you drive had no prop at all.😮
1057436,Garnet,2020-03-17 10:22:00,2056,"Hi was a great prop, I ran 1 on my Sprint for years. If a boat is prop correctly you can't over drive it."
1057439,aplumma,2020-03-17 13:01:00,6896,"My name is Art an I have a boat addiction. With the variety of water I can fish from the ocean to small rivers nearby I have 4 boats. A 28 ft twin engine deep water boat, a 19 ft Ranger, A 18 ft jetdrive john boat and a 10 ft pontoon boat.  The boat you saw  is a great boat for shallow waters  with it's ability to run in 6 inches of water and reinforced bottom it can take a strike pretty well. It however is not happy with weeds which clog the intake and has to be cleared by hand. Art"
1057457,LeXXington,2020-03-17 20:39:00,1928,So basically my boat has currently. Merc 90 with a 13.25 and Pitch 17. She moved very fast but with just me and the dog in it 90% of the time speed is not the issue.  Top speed is 37mph but hardly ever take it above 27mph unless perfect with no or little waves. The prop selectors don't even recommend the prop I currently have so its a little bit confusing. I would really like to be able to cruise  planing at a lower speed than 16mph.   Sure when there are no waves top speed all the way. 
1057458,lew,2020-03-17 20:47:00,12766,"Paul, my last boat was a deep V Skeeter with a 150 Yamaha. The dealer told me he'd give me any stainless prop I wanted and seeing as I wanted the proper one for my rig I contacted Skeeter and they told me exactly which prop would be optimum for me and that's what the dealer put on it. If you were to contact Princecraft and give them all your details I'm sure they could tell you the right prop for your set-up too. And BTW, I've spent time in your boat with the previous owner and you've got an excellent ride there."
1057460,misfish,2020-03-17 20:57:00,29133,I thought I knew that boat till you said that Lew . Johns old boat ?

1057462,Freshtrax,2020-03-17 21:50:00,2215,Just read the whole thread and ran out to the shop to check it.  It's a 13x17p  mercury spitfire.   If your close to your max rpm with the prop you have now it's probably a good fit.
1057467,captpierre,2020-03-17 23:06:00,2521,Minimal trolling speed went from 2 to 2.8 mph going to 4 blade. Now need drift sock to slow down for eyes.   Better hole shot and lower RPMs at 20 mph.
