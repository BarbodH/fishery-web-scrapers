1062677,Raycaster,2020-06-02 02:29:00,528,Re-wiring a Terrova on another boat and realized I had Minn Kota MKR kit plug kit around to use. Unfortunately with 6ga wiring you really need the adapter for it without hacking the cable to make it fit. I guess it’s a old Discontinued product and pretty hard to track down. Anyone seen one available? The full kit is $70 bucks but just need adapter.  thx ahead. 
1062681,Garnet,2020-06-02 11:55:00,2056,The list of places to get are Rockeys Tackle Angler Outfitters Radio World Or you can go to Canadian Tire and buy a Hubble Plug just be sure your plug has the right in turn plug.

1062684,AKRISONER,2020-06-02 13:08:00,5558,"Sorry if I’m mistaking what your issue is, but I was having issues with minkotta’s plugs so at the recommendation of my close electrician friend I switched my entire plug to a heavy duty twist lock RV plug. I was able to buy one at the Home Depot. He actually switched his on his boat too because he said the minkotta plugs are crap in comparison. I personally absolutely love the conversion. It’s way more heavy duty and the wire holders are far far sturdier. (I was having a problem with my wires falling out of the minkotta receptacle which actually caused a fire in my boat)  "
1062688,Garnet,2020-06-02 13:30:00,2056,You need to stabilize those wires. I had a boat same sort of thing. Took a piece of coat hang taped it to wires and ran other end to front panel screws. Had to up size screw seem to work. It just stopped wires from bouncing.
1062730,John Bacon,2020-06-03 13:51:00,3277,I have the Marinco plug.  I believe that they make the Minn Kota plug too.  I agree with them being crap.  I am planning to replace mine.
