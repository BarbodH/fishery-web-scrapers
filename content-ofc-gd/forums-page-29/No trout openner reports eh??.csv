1061420,AKRISONER,2020-05-06 14:55:00,5558,hmmmm...this makes me itch to head to my brookie spot.
1061426,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-06 16:42:00,937,"I went to my local river last minute for opener, I wasn’t  planning to go but I didn’t wanna spend the day at home.  I was surprised how low and clear the river was. Not much happening, I was very surprised how the winter changed the beautiful pools I use to fish.  All the deep pools got filled in which was sad."
1061430,NAW,2020-05-06 17:22:00,4022,That''s great!!  I finally gave up and went to stocked pond...
1061431,NAW,2020-05-06 17:23:00,4022,"Some of my spots where changed a lot from past years as well.  Pools half filled in some places, and sand bars blown away in others."
1061439,Streamhound,2020-05-06 19:23:00,36,I'm surprised at the water level as well being so early in the season..still find it a bit behind schedule in the catching Dept..but it isn't all about the catching is it .
1061943,Streamhound,2020-05-16 23:51:00,36,May 13/14 Saugeen river Sunny warm bugs were out but not biting.. fishing was slow on Wed. Thursday am was fantastic..cloudy..prestorm..water level low but cool...good two days in the outdoors..other than losing my net...    
1062738,Streamhound,2020-06-03 15:28:00,36,"May 30, 31 Grey/Bruce Fishing was on and off...wacky weather this season.     "
1062743,NAW,2020-06-03 16:41:00,4022,"Hey man, at least you got out!!  Thanks for the pics man!"
1060915,NAW,2020-04-27 20:15:00,4022,"Even with all this Covid stuff going on, I still thought I would see a report or two this morning from everyone trout opener.  "
1060916,AKRISONER,2020-04-27 20:28:00,5558,Got skunked two days in a row...I suck at fly fishing.  does that count lol
1060937,chris.brock,2020-04-28 01:19:00,4053,"stocked brookies are open year round here so Chuck and I made a long hike into a lake on Thursday, not a single bite! how's that for a report Nick, lol"
1060952,NAW,2020-04-28 11:47:00,4022,I fished both days with my kids.  We got skunked as well!!  I don't feel so bad now!! Couldn't beat the weather though!!  
1060959,misfish,2020-04-28 14:13:00,29133,Just back from a few hours on a small stream. Not a sniff. Lost 3 stone flys. LOL I like fishing it when the bug action is better . There wasn't a one seen . Even under rocks there was not a lot to see .  Felt good to atleast get out  .
1060970,AKRISONER,2020-04-28 17:51:00,5558,"saturday we had a crazy hatch of some kinda midges, i ate one when a breeze blew one in my open mouth lol...not that that helped me catch any trout at all lollll"
1060973,GBW,2020-04-28 18:20:00,8460,"I went for a walk through the forest on Sat and not a single fish seen, no people either and not even a sign of fiddle heads starting either."
1060974,misfish,2020-04-28 18:44:00,29133,"Funny, I was thinking the same thing when I was walking the banks. I am going to check another spot in the morning."
1060976,Chuck Enwinde,2020-04-28 19:33:00,247,Fiddleheads are way behind this year.  Bumped in to a few of these though 
1060978,NAW,2020-04-28 19:36:00,4022,VERY NICE!!
1060980,misfish,2020-04-28 19:42:00,29133,Very nice bud. 
1060981,GBW,2020-04-28 19:45:00,8460,Maybe with the rain my area should/could be getting the next 3 day's it might get them going.
1060985,BillM,2020-04-28 21:45:00,17367,"Can't wait for the fiddleheads.  As for steelhead, fall only for this guy."
1060991,Old Ironmaker,2020-04-29 02:29:00,8243,It feels like yesterday your kids were brand new. A better word would be babies.
1061003,NAW,2020-04-29 12:40:00,4022,Round 1 - seven years ago!   
1061029,msp,2020-04-29 18:25:00,1336,did crappy. my spot got poached all week. walked a couple other home tribs and got some fish here and there. nothin special. may be my last year fishing opener.
1061038,NAW,2020-04-29 20:28:00,4022,I hear ya man. The spot I went oppenning morning got poached as well.  My buddy caught a guy fishing there Friday morning while he was out walking his dog..  its sad.
1061058,Dutch01,2020-04-30 02:06:00,1431,I'm really lucky to have a creek behind me (literally 75m from my back door) and a river 90 seconds drive. Opener was busy this year I'm not use to seeing many people there.  I still managed to keep a good distance from everyone and get into some fish.  
1061064,NAW,2020-04-30 13:19:00,4022,You are a lucky man!  nice fish!
1061074,misfish,2020-04-30 15:24:00,29133,  LOL  Nice fish bud.

Good luck all Stay safe    
1061118,GBW,2020-05-01 06:14:00,8460,"Wow, such a good looking fish!  Congrats."
