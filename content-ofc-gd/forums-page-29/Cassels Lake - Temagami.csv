1062829,Woodsman,2020-06-05 01:25:00,1286,"Lots of structure in the lake. Also can boat into Rabbit lake. Lake has walleye, smallmouths, pike, lakers, herring whitefish. For some reason around 20' seems to work good for walleye. Most of our walleyes come from trolling worm harnesses or still fishing at dusk. Where are you staying? "
1062833,Dreamkaster76,2020-06-05 02:21:00,7,My family is from temagami  been fishing temiskaming for years  just changing up for a few days  I only jig for walleye - not liking trolling  I’m always using live bait but would love to catch pickerel on jig and tails
1062834,Woodsman,2020-06-05 02:42:00,1286,Launching at the public launch on the north end of the lake? Or should I phrase it as the most northerly public launch you can drive to.  
1062876,Dreamkaster76,2020-06-06 01:05:00,7,I’ll be launching from temagami livery
1062877,irishfield,2020-06-06 02:56:00,26272,on Snake Island lake..
1062880,Woodsman,2020-06-06 10:06:00,1286,The Public Launch Ramp on Fox Run is a better ramp and parking is far better. About 4 kms further up the road from where you plan on launching.
