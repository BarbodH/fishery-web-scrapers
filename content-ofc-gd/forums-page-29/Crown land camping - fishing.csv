I have been camping several times this year.  Even got out  once before the camping ban was put in place.  I don't mind breaking the ban on camping when I am alone or just my wife and i..  But I wasn't going to bring my kids with me during ban.  They have been chomping at the bit to get out in the bush!    Finally this weekend, we hit our usual early season spot!  It was a great weekend, with great weather.  Bug were manageable, and actually almost non existent in the wind.  And my youngest daughter is keeping her pickerel streak going!!  She has horseshoes in uncomfortable places in her body... Her uncle Jeff and her went out together and came back with breakfast!   While my son and I in our boat got skunked listening to their laughing and screams of excitement..  "
