1062952,LeXXington,2020-06-08 01:27:00,1928,"Cheers to the gentleman who decided to launch his boat in Port Credit Promenade Sunday at 12:pm noon on a bright sunny day.  Such an amazing Sunday, Warm almost summer conditions perfect day for boating in the city. Once the boat was tied off at the launch ramp there was no better place to load your boat.  Your right it was a very sunny day better head back to your car and get the sun top . We all felt sorry for you going again back to your car for the 3rd or was it the 4th time and as you lugged the 12volt battery that thing looked so heavy in the heat.  I was worried you might have lost your boat keys as you kept going to your car and back looking through bags and cloths? Don't pay any heed to the yelling and shuffling as everyone tried to launch and retrieve boats around you.   Yes it was me one of the boats doing circle's trying to figure out how I could dock on the only open side, I was going to wave but with  all the boats doing circles I had to keep adjusting forward and revers. Not sure what the other boaters said to you but by your actions it must have been encouragement to make sure everything is perfect for your first outing of the year. Sure if 2020 had been different you might have had a chance to prep your boat in mid May but since the Launch only opened a few weeks ago we can all see your issue.  Hope you got it all set as you were still tied to the dock as I left . Thanks LeXX "

1062955,BillM,2020-06-08 01:39:00,17367,Hows the new ramp?  Didn't they just redo it?
1062957,LeXXington,2020-06-08 01:46:00,1928,"I used the Promenade no changes that I see, the Port credit lighthouse is still closed as its underwater. They were suppose to redo it all but with the high water who knows. "

1062959,Rattletrap2,2020-06-08 02:05:00,1652,Oblivious!
1062967,Fisherman,2020-06-08 11:55:00,7201,"You should have video taped it, could have made a perfect ""how not to launch and annoy people""."
1062976,Canuck,2020-06-08 18:33:00,491,"I am now slipped in a marina.  I don't miss the launch ramp lunatics.  You should print out a bunch of copies of ""launch ramp rules and etiquette"" and hand them out.  It was likely a new boat owner (or an obliviot)  and that might help speed things up the next time.  Or not.... On the opposite end of the spectrum, I was at a three lane ramp once and had just arrived at the top of the ramp and was getting the boat unchained and ready to back in.  (yes I was 100% prepped in advance.  this was simply untying the stern tie downs, removing the bow chain and backing off the tension on the winch strap.).  This dork backed down at an angle between the back of my boat and the water, dumped his POS bowrider and tied it to the dock on my side.  I had to wait for him to boat away before i could launch.  I thought about untying his boat while he parked, but let it go.  He stunk like booze and I thought nothing good would come of it."
