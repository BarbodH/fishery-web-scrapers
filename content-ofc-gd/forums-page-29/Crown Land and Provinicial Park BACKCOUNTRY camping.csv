1062651,NAW,2020-06-01 15:14:00,4022,It's great news!  Honestly though.  I did not agree with the crown land camping ban.  It made me really mad that they did that.  So happy it's over.
1062685,AKRISONER,2020-06-02 13:11:00,5558,Regular camping is extremely challenging due to the toilet facilities. The outhouses I’ve experienced are typically a mess on a good day. I think that’s the problem as it is that is not allowing for them to open already.
