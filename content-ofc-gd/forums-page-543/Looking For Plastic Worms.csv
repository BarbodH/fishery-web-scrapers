580176,GBW,2011-05-06 14:40:00,8460,I found a bunch of Storm rattle ribbon tail worms at dollarama a few years ago.
580177,ADB,2011-05-06 14:41:00,444," Be careful with Canadian Tire...some stuff can be an okay deal, but on other tackle, etc. you might be getting ripped off for an extra dollar or two.  I see you're in Kitchener.  Go to Natural Sports (Victoria and Lackner), they have a good selection.  http://www.naturalsports.ca/"
