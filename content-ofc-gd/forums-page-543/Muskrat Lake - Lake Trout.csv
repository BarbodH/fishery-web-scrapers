579788,mike rousseau,2011-05-05 08:02:00,4661,I've been up there in the winter... Is it as basic as I think it is in the open water season... Flat line... Planers... Large main structures...  ??
579807,MuskieWannabe,2011-05-05 11:50:00,79,"In the summer downriggers are a must but as the water is still cold I was just flatlining, no planerboards.  Once the water warms up a bit they'll be down around 60' so downriggers or dipsy's are best.  I was just off a point by 50 or 100 yards where I caught the ones above."
579843,irishfield,2011-05-05 14:30:00,26272,Some nice fishing there fella!  Unfortunately we can't target them yet in Zone 11 thanks to a no science reg change. Can't fish for a fall spawner in the spring.. go figure!
579931,MuskieWannabe,2011-05-05 18:34:00,79,"One of my buddies is heading up there for the opener so good luck when it rolls around.  I'm not sure why there is an area with it open from Jan 1st until the fall and everywhere else is different.  Too bad they all weren't open all spring, would make a lot of people happy."
