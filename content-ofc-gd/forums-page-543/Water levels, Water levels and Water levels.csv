577666,Billy Bob,2011-04-29 17:12:00,5865,Went crappie fishing Wed and the water level at Chautauqua Lake was incredibly HIGH...so high I was basically launching my boat from the parking lot.....areas that I use to drift for walleyes in 11 FOW was now 16-17 feet deep...  Here's a couple of pics of the launch area...    Now I heard from my fishing partner that's also a outdoor writer that if we get anymore rain some of the Finger Lakes may be closed to boating....this happened a few years ago on Oneida Lake and I am planning on fishing the walleye opener there next Saturday.  So how are the water levels where you guys are.....water still down from last year or maybe now too much water like we have this year.  Bob
577678,BITEME,2011-04-29 17:43:00,1968,Never ever to high
577680,mercman,2011-04-29 17:44:00,7054,"The big river is a bit high, but they usually control that by opening and closing gates just west of Montreal.After that big wind we got yesterday, the water looks more like chocolate milk than water.I have never seen waves as high as what i saw yesterday.The wind direction pushed the water along with the current, and lifted huge whitecaps off the top. Some of the smaller tribs are quite high though.The Richilieu is 4-6 feet higher than normal and there is some flooding in lower areas.  Paul"
577695,Billy Bob,2011-04-29 18:24:00,5865, It is if you have property on a lake or river.....flood waters are responsible for more damage than anything else nature can throw at you.
577696,BITEME,2011-04-29 18:28:00,1968,  I think there could be a lesson there
577699,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-29 18:34:00,0,the levels may be up now but I know that georgian bay levels are back to their low...with a good east wind they reach 1964 levels ....on the east side ...
577709,bubbles,2011-04-29 18:55:00,591,Still too low
577712,mike rousseau,2011-04-29 19:04:00,4661,St. Lawrence river is up at least a foot from normal above the Dam in Cornwall... I'm fishing carp right now and my chair in sitting in water where it should be high and dry
577714,blaque,2011-04-29 19:10:00,2419,Theres Walleye in Chatauqua?
577798,spincast,2011-04-29 23:27:00,3279,  Good things its not any higher Bob - or else those bearings would be getting wet
577807,Jer,2011-04-29 23:58:00,1426,     Now that's why I love this place...
577912,Billy Bob,2011-04-30 11:43:00,5865,  ME TOO....
577913,Billy Bob,2011-04-30 11:44:00,5865, Not sure about Chatauqua......but there are in Chautauqua Lake...
577968,bucktail,2011-04-30 16:38:00,1857,Check this site out for some near real time Great Lakes levels.  http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/now/wlevels/levels.html
577970,LeXXington,2011-04-30 16:43:00,1928,"Lake Huron looks even lower this year,, Up near Kincardine."
580140,blaque,2011-05-06 12:37:00,2419, I havent found a good walleye bite on that lake for.....i dont even know how long.
580152,bigbuck,2011-05-06 13:09:00,2449,"The Honey Harbour area of Georgian Bay was really low on the weekend, that east wind that killed the bite was no help either. There wasn't too much snow over the winter so that doesn't help either."
580443,JimC,2011-05-07 13:42:00,86,Lake Nipissing? So whatz up this year guys n gals?    Goin up last week of May
580480,Rich Clemens,2011-05-07 19:30:00,3131,"Same thing down here.   All the dams and reservoirs are extremely high.  Local major dam has some of the launches closed due to the high water.  And, of course, they're all muddy due to all the run off."
580512,Crazy Ivan,2011-05-07 21:47:00,184, And Muskies too!  I was there for a Muskies Cda. can-am years ago. Nice place.
580517,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-07 22:01:00,3761," Part of nature, it's not the water's fault it's ours for developing too close....Hope I never see that situation."
