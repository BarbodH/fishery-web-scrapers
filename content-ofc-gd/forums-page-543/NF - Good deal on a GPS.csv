Pretty slick unit - 5"" screen and includes lifetime map and traffic updates. Some reviews - http://www.gpscity.ca/garmin-nuvi-1490-lmt-reviews.html"
580479,Rich Clemens,2011-05-07 19:28:00,3131,"That's about what I paid for the 1450 LMT version on Black Friday last year.  Great little unit and have gone through two free map updates already.   Although, when I ran the map updates, the total process took over 1 1/2 hours to complete - closer to 2 hours EACH.  Traffic updates work nice, when in range for the signal.   Alerted me to traffic congestion in Pittsburgh this year.  That 5"" screen is sweet."
