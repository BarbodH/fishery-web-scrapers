Sun screen is always a pain in the butt, but i use it everyday that i am on the water.The product that i use is a spary on spf60 by coppertone.You dont have to rub it on, or get your hands all greasey. Which means you are not transfering the product you your lures and bait. Dont be a hero.Protect yourself."
