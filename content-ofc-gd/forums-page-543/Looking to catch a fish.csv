579961,Ron,2011-05-05 20:32:00,1683,"Hey all,  My daughter will be coming home this weekend and I was hoping that I would be able to take her out and catch some fish. I live an hour East of Toronto, close to the Kawarthas.  Anybody know of any good spots to take her? Any area within a 5 hr drive would be fine.  Thanks in advance.  Cheers, Ron...  Oh, btw, she is into catching big Crappie, big Walleye, big Bass, big Carp and Muskie.            "
579964,Roy,2011-05-05 20:42:00,13728,Ron! Why ask us? I think you should be asking her!  I can't believe how much she looks like my youngest daughter when she was that age!
579965,Harrison,2011-05-05 20:48:00,2202,"Not much fishing around there. Sorry Ron.  However I seem to recall losing a nice GLoomis hat one night when we went out. Any idea where it might be.  Good on her Ron, I'll show my daughter the post tonight."
579968,Ron,2011-05-05 20:57:00,1683," Are you trying to tell me something Roy? I have never been to Quebec, have you ever been to Ontario?   I wonder if it's the same hat, I lost one here around the house too a while back. However, I relocated my Muskies Canada hat round the same time my GLoomis went missing! Hmmm, could it be?????   Cheers, Ron..."
579980,Joey,2011-05-05 21:49:00,9122,"Well that crappie is huge, why not go where you caught that?  Have a great weekend with your daughter, or Roy's"
579981,misfish,2011-05-05 21:51:00,29133, You gave it away J.
580013,irishfield,2011-05-06 00:22:00,26272,"No good fishing that close bud... keep going for another 9 hours or so, but take an auger!"
580014,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-06 00:27:00,1622,"Head to one of the Hydro plants down that way if the wind is good, should have just about everything in or around them SBK"
580077,Photoz,2011-05-06 02:54:00,792,"If she wants something B I I I  I   G with lotsa power, I'll be over behind the big Independent grocery store (east side, in the park) anytime after 05:30 Saturday. I have lotsa strawberry & anise flavoured corn, enough for both of you, me & half of the board too! I see she knows how to catch carp, decent one she's holding there! Hopefully the water has warmed up a few degrees to get 'em moving! Drop over if ya have time!"
580112,solopaddler,2011-05-06 10:55:00,8605,An odd post. Don't most people ask you where they should be fishing?  If you're interested in brook trout I know a great outfitter with exclusive rights in QC just north of Deep River and the Ottawa river. Cheap prices and a quality fishery.  Shoot me a pm if you want the info.
580220,bubbles,2011-05-06 17:12:00,591,"In 5 hours you could be down here and fish the Detroit River, the eyes are stating to heat up down here, should be good this weekend......"
580255,esoxansteel,2011-05-06 20:15:00,1307,"Ron only a 5 hour drive, thats just a short sprint for you, go 10 minutes west the the big G and catch some steelhead"
580270,Handlebarz,2011-05-06 21:25:00,3790,I here that the Detroit River has some fish in it come down here and see how you do.  Sorry to say it Roy but I know steph and she is to tall to be your off spring
580273,chessy,2011-05-06 21:34:00,610,"i think you should be taking your son out fishing, he has been waiting at the end of the driveway every weekend waiting for his dad to pick him up, dont you think its time to spend some time with him and give me a break  LMAO you second wife says hi"
580415,Ron,2011-05-07 08:22:00,1683,"Thanks for all the replies guys.  As it turns out, I will be home sick in bed. bummer."
