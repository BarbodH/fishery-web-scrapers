580151,Rizzo,2011-05-06 13:06:00,4754,After careful consideration and input from OFC'er's I'm heading to Mitchell lake to hopefully clear some pike out of there. Not sure where the launch is but don't expect it will be too tough to find.  Any idea which side of 48 I should be fishing on? Can I actually use the big motor on this lake or will it be all trolling motor all the time.
580153,Harrison,2011-05-06 13:12:00,2202,I think if I were you I'd be fishnig the lake close to there that is named after a waterway you would use to get there.  JMO.
580155,BucktownAngler,2011-05-06 13:15:00,582,i was there last weekend.....watch for tree stumps.  i did more a lot casting then trolling there
580157,BucktownAngler,2011-05-06 13:28:00,582,"Also...the lake is so small, you can fish the whole thing"
580161,BITEME,2011-05-06 13:35:00,1968,I would launch in Balsam where it goes in to the canal on balam lake drive transit the canal and your in Mitchell there is usually always parking there. Plus if you get board you can always pound that area of balsam.  dont know your start point but the lat and long from google earth is 44 34'40.62n  78 53' 43.04w other option there use to be a launch after you cleared kirkfield and you go across a bridge before you hit the shalomar its a provincial park and on the north side  peter
580162,Rizzo,2011-05-06 13:47:00,4754,"thanks guys. I've used that Balsam launch lots of times (to fish Balsam), just didn't know how long it would take to get to mitchell from there as I only have 4 or 5 hours to fish so time is valuable.  Boss, how did you guys do?  Although I'm pretty close to 100% catch and release, I will definitely do what I can to keep a pike or 6."
580170,addy79,2011-05-06 14:18:00,573,"I've done well on Mitchell right off the canal in front of the big island, spinner baits in the summer were a killer burned back to the boat FAST! I havent seen many pike in there..."
580171,BITEME,2011-05-06 14:25:00,1968,if no one is around first thing 5 min to rip through the channel probably less
580267,Bernie66,2011-05-06 21:07:00,123,"There is a small launch right at the lake.  If you are heading east on #48, turn left after you cross the bridge. Nothing fancy, almost like the one at Canal lake. Goodluck."
580397,Kerry,2011-05-07 04:00:00,383,The one at Mitchell is a pay to use site like canal lake.Last time I was there it was 6 bucks. Kerry
