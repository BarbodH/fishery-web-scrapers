579528,Lip-ripper,2011-05-04 20:30:00,228,"I have a 2008 Ranger 4X4 and had the same problem as you. Talk to the fellow at the steering wheel and get him to order you a set of spring helpers. Costs around $60, and you can bolt them on in 10 minutes. They will beef up your cargo capacity and lift about .5-1 inch. Here's what they look like, I hope this helps...  "
579533,Tybo,2011-05-04 20:37:00,1373,Lip Ripper Is Bang on. Just need a helper. That's pretty good for your first post.
579536,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 20:41:00,5784,  Nice one! I'll visit the Steering Wheel this weekend.
579580,misfish,2011-05-04 21:47:00,29133,"  Im just saying here Paul,but it,s not the way IMO. Go with a full assembled package.Adding something like this is just trouble."
579597,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 22:40:00,5784,  Hmm now I'm confused haha. I'll talk to HE Brown and the Steering Wheel to get their opinions on all these suggestions.
579600,Lip-ripper,2011-05-04 22:51:00,228,"If you overload your truck, you'll have problems no matter what method you use.  I have had these on for 2 years and haven't had any issues at all.  I often have my ATV in the back of the truck and they have helped.  It weighs around 600lbs.  Whatever method you do end up with will help, I just found this method was the most cost effective and didn't affect my warranty (I called Stockfish).  Just curious, Rod caster, were you at the Nosbonsing M&G back in December?"
579605,Whitespinnerbait,2011-05-04 23:00:00,2038, Band aid solution if i've ever seen one
579606,misfish,2011-05-04 23:02:00,29133, Hope you have that as proof.
579608,misfish,2011-05-04 23:06:00,29133," Man, I had the name in my head and lost it.I know the ones you speak of.  Ah just came to me.Load levelers.Made by Monroes.Had them on the back of my 69 Corenet."
579615,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 23:33:00,5784,"  ya, I was there. you too?  I do like this option, as I won't be overloading the truck too much. If I needed more I could always add-on, or spend more. I'll also look into adding a full leaf and the airbags... I'll get some info from the suppliers before I make a decision. Thanks again to everyone"
579637,Lip-ripper,2011-05-05 00:13:00,228,"Yep, red portable shack, black Ford ranger..."
579669,Bernie,2011-05-05 00:55:00,3190,"I'd second Randy's post with the Timbrins. They only come into play when you add a load and don't affect normal ride. I have installed several sets of those and they work well. Airbags are also a good option but more expensive. Adding a leaf will make it ride rough, especially unloaded."
579732,Muskieman,2011-05-05 02:04:00,2472,"Bernie is right too!  But ...Lip-ripper added something good too... Helper Springs do help as well. I also used to sell these.. not as many as the Timbrens though.  HELLWIG make a darned good set that doesn't ""SLAP"" easy to install yourself.  HELLWIG # 550........ EZ-550Lb Capacity HELLWIG # 990........ EZ-990-2000Lb Capacity  Forget about ""The Steering Wheel"" on Main E... really nice and knowledgeable guy.. but wants too much for his stuff.  Again, go see Rick at Benson by Burger World near Wal-Mart.  bring Hellwig # 550 .. instead of getting it at retail 81.76$... probably 74.99$  ......Hellwig # 990 .. 117.72$ .... probably 94.99$  Tell Rick, Tony or John that , I sent ya.

579740,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-05 02:17:00,10439, Koni also makes a spring over shock.
579967,Tybo,2011-05-05 20:57:00,1373,"The problem adding a leaf is the truck is sagging with trailer weight.If you add a leaf it will lift the front of the truck. losing up the steering.  Had the helper on my 87 for 670k never had no problem.Towed more in that one truck then all others combined. Dad had a couple of sets on his truck from factory. A friend put helper on his front leafs of his ford to help stop the wheel hop.  Air bladder is the way to go. If you are going to use them most of the time.To justify the cost. If you have twin exust pipe you have to be careful. To get the pipe around the spare,the pipe will sit to close to the air bladder. Rotting it faster from the heat.Found that out on my 76.  Spring over shocks have nothing to do with weight.There designed to help keep the wheels on the ground under rough conditions.Had them on my 83.  But the rule is. If your truck does't sag from the weight of your boat.YOU NEED A BIGGER BOAT!!  Forgot one. Had helpers on the 72 courier.Towed a 14ft VooDoo  with a 90 Stinger on the back."
579971,Ron,2011-05-05 21:13:00,1683,"If your load in the back of the truck is consistant, go with a helper leaf spring. If you have variable loads on a daily basis, go with air bag system.  I had a 86 Ranger that always carried my carpentry tools during the week and fishing gear on the weekends. Added a leaf to beef up the suspension, it was great for work but like a bucket of bolts on the weekends.  My 2010 Tundra I went with the air bags and glad I did. I can level out every load quick and easy. FYI, I have a tandem dump trailer rated for 10,000 lbs and load varies one load to the next.  Cheers, Ron..."
579246,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 00:15:00,5784,What is the cheapest/easiest way to strengthen the rear suspension so it doesn't sag under load? I'd also like to see a 0.5 to 1inch lift. I'm not a truck guru but I have a good basic knowledge. I would not do the job myself because I don't have a garage or the proper tools. 2010 Mazda B4000 (read Ford Ranger)  Larger leafs? Bigger shocks? other options?  Thx
579247,misfish,2011-05-04 00:19:00,29133, How much load are you talking Rod? Your talking tonka truck here.
579249,skeeter,2011-05-04 00:21:00,1907,Go to a spring shop and ask them to re-arch your leaf springs and add an extra leaf. Tell them exactly what you want and they will do it.
579250,danbouck,2011-05-04 00:21:00,4380,The ride will get much worse with no load
579253,irishfield,2011-05-04 00:23:00,26272,Bigger shocks do zilch.. unless they are air shocks. That may be an option so you can run them normal for a decent empty ride and then pump them up a tad more for days you're carrying a load.
579254,mikdor,2011-05-04 00:25:00,109,I haul a 24 ft travel trailer with my silverador (98) an I put a set of air bags on now I add air or take air out depending on the load. I have no issues with them they are great. mikdor
579255,misfish,2011-05-04 00:26:00,29133," Good call Dan. With no load,yer going to bounce all over the road. Like having yer tires blown up to the max. Been there. I read max pressure,ok lets do it. Talk about crazy ride when you hit the smallist of pot holes/rail tracks."
579262,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 00:40:00,5784,"  my truck is bouncy already, sometimes I hope the wheels will catch again.  I'm not talking about very large loads, maybe 500-2000lbs. The rangers/Bseries are famous for the ""sag"" even under light loads and I figured I could get a good comprimise between comfort and capacity with a small adjustment.  Skeeter: that's a good idea, that way I can get them to dial it in just right for me since leaf springs come in many varieties.... it's probably the cheapest option too. Now to find out if North Bay has a spring shop"
579265,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 00:44:00,5784,"  I'll look into this option too... although I'm a bit skeptical about long term quality, especially with generic (read low cost) brands."
579268,irishfield,2011-05-04 00:47:00,26272,I have air shocks on my old '69 superbee.. been there since I was 17 years old and they still work fine. Mind you they made stuff a little better way back when.. lol..
579270,misfish,2011-05-04 00:49:00,29133,"  Why would he want re-arch? Just ask them to add a spring,or just ask them to put a new pack full spring for what you wnat. Were talking small truck here. Something to take  in concideration  aswell here,can your motor handle the towing?  Air shocks are for the late 70 early 80 cool factor.How high can you rise yer assend.LOL"
579272,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 00:51:00,5784,  oh ya no problems with the motor. That 4.0L loves to work.
579275,misfish,2011-05-04 01:00:00,29133," 4.2 6 cyl  here ,full size F150 manual. Hell, yer half the size.Care to drag.LOL  Look at spring upgrade package. Shocks absorb,springs support the load."
579277,irishfield,2011-05-04 01:05:00,26272, They were actually first brought out for Cadillacs to haul RV trailers. I had them on the Bee so you couldn't tell there were 6 people in the trunk going into the drive in !!
579279,Raf,2011-05-04 01:06:00,3495,"add-a-leaf will work.  poke around on the ranger/mazda sites, you can propably get what you need from the junkyard if you're on a budget.  ie. s10 leafs work on cherokees."
579280,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 01:07:00,5784,"  You'd win, my traction control stops me from having any fun"
579296,Whitespinnerbait,2011-05-04 01:40:00,2038,No need to re-arch..........add a extra leaf = problem solved
579315,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-04 02:12:00,10439,I added a set of air bags on my Honda Pilot and they work great!!! The truck handles and corners way better than without and I can get rid of the suspension sag when towing. They were not expensive for my application either. They were under $100 US and delivery was $11 (special deal) from JC Whitney in the States.  Installation was more involved on my vehicle than it will be on yours (the pilot has IFS and coil springs) but still only took about 4 hours even with the extra time it took to run the air lines into the vehicle (I put the valve inside the jack compartment)
579316,rob v,2011-05-04 02:16:00,535,I went the extra leaf route with  my 2000 ford ranger - worked wonders for the sag problem.  I had the local spring shop set me up - they told me they're doing all the time on the rangers for exactly that reason - eliminate the sag.   And frankly I don't notice a big difference in the ride.  I would recommend this definitely
579344,OhioFisherman,2011-05-04 06:12:00,6623,"You can check and see if they make shocks with coil springs over them, the used to."
579347,Whitespinnerbait,2011-05-04 09:08:00,2038, 
579350,bdox,2011-05-04 10:31:00,329,"You can get longer shackels, but over time they will just let your leafs sag even more. I would look at getting a leaf added (shot or long, up to you depending on your preferences), as well as a .5"" or 1"" lift shackle.  add-a-Leaf for the load, shackle for the lift. They work great in combination."
579362,Muskieman,2011-05-04 11:22:00,2472,An extra leaf will cost you about 40$ each plus hardware at H.E Browns go see Rolly in the spring shop.  I'd also get a TIMBREN kit... I used to sell about 4 kits a week and they work wonders...see Rick @ Benson.. tell him I sent ya. They only work under load and will NOT sacrifice ride quality usually run about 139.00$/set.  Your part 1998-2007 Ranger # FRR0504A   Randy 
579366,Fisherman,2011-05-04 11:37:00,7201," Just looked at my friends Ranger, max cargo capacity is 1230lbs including passengers, subtract just the driver and a coffee and I wouldn't go past 1000lbs."
579367,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 11:38:00,5784," :worthy:There's no knowledge like local knowledge. Thanks Randy!   Rob V  I was hoping a Ranger-head would shime in! After all the advice, I think I'll go with the extra leaf, but I'm not eliminating the air bag (timbren) option.  It's official, you guys are awesome. In a few simple words I've gotten more info than I would have driving around town for a whole weekend."
