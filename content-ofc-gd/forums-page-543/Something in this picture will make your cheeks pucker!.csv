579611,spincast,2011-05-04 23:19:00,3279,ouch. WOT = $ $ $ $ $ bye bye.  2 nd battery for the trolling motor is starting to look a lot more attractive.
579629,fishforfun,2011-05-05 00:01:00,105,"$1.75 for marine fuel in Parry Sound right now, why you getting a deal Wayne?"
579631,irishfield,2011-05-05 00:02:00,26272,LOL Martin... I'm sure if I ever get there it will be $1.90 when I arrive!
579633,danc,2011-05-05 00:04:00,4677,Thank God that I don't have time to fish these days. The Lund doesn't burn a cent of gas sitting in the driveway.
579671,Ron,2011-05-05 00:55:00,1683,I hope everyone sells their boats. Well except me of course!

579677,Harrison,2011-05-05 00:59:00,2202,"There is a gas and electric motor on alot of boats already, there must be some engineer out there who can jimmy up some kind of Hybrid deal.  Let's get on it already!"
579681,irishfield,2011-05-05 01:01:00,26272,"I'm gonna rig a generator up to the propellor of the Verado Phil... so while I use the electric trolling motor, the verado prop will turn and run the generator, so that the power available to the TM will be perpetual !"

579691,splashhopper,2011-05-05 01:05:00,2931,that price looks like a serious pain in the
580593,walleyemaster,2011-05-08 02:28:00,325,"i dont know about you guys but gas always costs me the same, i have been putting $100 bucks in my tank no matter what gas costs a litre it always costs me $100..."
579529,irishfield,2011-05-04 20:33:00,26272,Ice is off Inlet Bay at the marina... but main lake is still ice covered and it will be a good few days before lake travel is possible on Temagami. 
579532,trapshooter,2011-05-04 20:37:00,1234,Ouch!
579537,mercman,2011-05-04 20:41:00,7054,1.65 / LITER ??? i think i'm gonna faint......
579538,irishfield,2011-05-04 20:41:00,26272,"Ya can say that again Ben ! Mind you, I'm surprised Andre' has it that  cheap considering Premium at the pumps in North Bay is $1.54/litre. So at $1.65 it's at the dock and guaranteed free of ethanol."
579539,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 20:43:00,5784,I predict a rise in Canoe sales this year.
579541,bubbles,2011-05-04 20:45:00,591,I say give me regular and throw some ethanol in it and I'll give you 1.00/lt.  Thieves
579542,Spiel,2011-05-04 20:45:00,9065,"I predict a rise in ""petroleum jelly"" sales."
579547,bushart,2011-05-04 20:51:00,2628,Well I just got my boat back a while ago from the shop---carb trouble  Said it's the ethanol in the gas---burn premium unleaded he said  I take it that's why that sign on that pump
579550,mercman,2011-05-04 20:52:00,7054,"  sorry, but thats funny as hell"
579552,irishfield,2011-05-04 20:54:00,26272,"Temagami marine has sold only Premium fuel as long as I've been on the lake. Adding ""ethanol free"" helps comfort those with sticker shock!"
579553,Spiel,2011-05-04 20:54:00,9065,  It would be hillarious Paul if it wasn't without some level of truth......
579555,aplumma,2011-05-04 20:55:00,6896,  I knew you Canadians were real smart y'all  figured out how to get your boats to run on that stuff.     Art
579556,HTHM,2011-05-04 20:57:00,4082,I thought you were refering to the Tracker on the pier.
579558,Joey,2011-05-04 21:00:00,9122,That's just so wrong
579560,grt1,2011-05-04 21:07:00,638,"I got 2 cruise a days filled today in town with regular gas, 10 gallons = $66. then you add in 8.95 for the oil and 9.99 for the seafoam .  Certainly isn't going to be a cheap year to run up and down the lake.  I'm not looking forward to the 40 gallon fillup on my big boat."
579562,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-04 21:10:00,2690,"Other than our trip up north in late August, and, musky opener next month, definitely staying alot closer to home this summer.  Yikes"
579563,solopaddler,2011-05-04 21:10:00,8605,"Sorry Wayne no sympathy from me.  The marina on my lake in N/W Quebec has averaged $2 a litre for the last 3 years.  Cash only, no credit.  It's owned by bikers and you don't want to mess with them.  I made the mistake once of buying gas there. Never again.  Now I'm forced to drive into town and fill a bunch of jerry cans. Huge pita."
579564,irishfield,2011-05-04 21:12:00,26272,Not looking for symphathy Mike.. figuring my boat won't make it to the lake this year anyhow! I guess there's a good side to that now...
579565,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-04 21:13:00,10439,If you want to get rid of ethanol in your fuel just move to the far North!!! I have been told (from several sources) that there is no ethanol in any of our fuels up here in the NWT.    :thumbsup_anim: In Alaska there are ethanol pumps but they are all well signed as well.   I think a lot of my open water fishing is going to be out in the baby boat with t 4hp on it.  
579567,Spiel,2011-05-04 21:16:00,9065," To make it even more inane keep in mind that ""petroleum jelly"" is a byproduct of oil production.....double whammy!"
579574,misfish,2011-05-04 21:36:00,29133,"Maybe I,ll stick with the cuddy and buy a kicker and plate,maybe even some riggers. The thoughts of a bass boat with a 150 just went for a crapper."
579581,aplumma,2011-05-04 21:53:00,6896,The only reason the oil companies would use petroleum jelly is to help the sand stick....  i'm just sayin  Art
579583,mercman,2011-05-04 21:57:00,7054,"  Now starts the quest for alternative lubrication.....""SIGH""."
579584,bushart,2011-05-04 21:57:00,2628,Reminds me of dat ole sayin  Out of the night came a terrible scream---who put the sand in the vaseline??  Just sayin
579587,misfish,2011-05-04 22:05:00,29133, SICKO
