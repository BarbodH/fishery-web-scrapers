580209,mpt,2011-05-06 16:54:00,158,I thought you were talking about these guys...  
580380,Twocoda,2011-05-07 02:39:00,4130, Thanks Jacques it was my intention of getting some images of fish attached to a line and jumping or breaking water..but for some reason the people that were fishing couldnt hook into a fish...it kinda made me regret not bringing my gear with me ..went down tonight to try to do it ALL myself and lost every single fish due to lack of focus on fishing the fish while trying to get the camera shots...im going back tomorrow morning with a few capable buddies ...leaving my gear at home and only taking the camera...cross my fingers...for better results
580381,bassman87,2011-05-07 02:47:00,586,those are some nice shots. thanks

568618,GBW,2011-04-03 02:29:00,8460,"great pic's for sure and if it was up to me, YES you win and OFC hat..."

568963,johnnyb,2011-04-04 15:02:00,3413,Very cool shots!!!
569135,limeyangler,2011-04-05 00:17:00,5204,:thumbsup_anim:  :thumbsup_anim:  Very nice shots!
569214,alphaalpha,2011-04-05 02:40:00,475,"very cool shots, thanks for posting!"
569221,tibbs,2011-04-05 03:09:00,650,Great Pics!  The one with the two fish jumping at the same time is awesome.
569238,LucG,2011-04-05 20:13:00,779,"Sweet shots! I like how you can really see their colours. That would be cool to catch with a telephoto lens, even tho it might be nearly impossible."
569258,misfish,2011-04-05 20:45:00,29133,"The double leap up was cool.  One looked freshers then the other, by the silver look.   Great pics."
569261,splashhopper,2011-04-05 20:54:00,2931,great pics dave.
569279,Twocoda,2011-04-05 21:41:00,4130,Thanks for the kindness everyone ...the pics are on a telephoto lense but it is only a 200 mm ...i went down yesterday to get some more pics from the other side of the river (closer to the fish) but the river is a total blow out with all the rain and melting snow outta the bush...ill keep trying though ...  Cheers
569312,kyle7273,2011-04-05 22:46:00,65,Is that at Denny's?
570153,Twocoda,2011-04-08 03:20:00,4130,Heres another from today...the fish were not co-operating for some reason there was only one fish that actually jumped straight tonight ...most were sideways/backwards half jumps or just popped thier heads out of the water...might because of all the dirty water they ingested after the last rain   
570156,emanuel,2011-04-08 03:27:00,4,nice pics now all you need is a net .... just kiding id rather fish for them
570159,Twocoda,2011-04-08 03:31:00,4130,I think this year ill see if i cant get some jumpers attached to a line ...ive tried in the past but was unsuccessful as its hard to operate a camera and a fishing rod at the same time...
575213,Twocoda,2011-04-22 15:26:00,4130,Here is a few more to get the adrenaline pumping for the opener...           Happy opener tonight!!!! Clean up after yourselves and dont forget your licenses...  CHEERS!
575215,Live2fish85,2011-04-22 15:31:00,1633,Hey those are some amazing pictures looks like you have an eye for photography thats for sure.
575219,Twocoda,2011-04-22 15:41:00,4130,Thanks...i could use some spelling lessons though ...
580095,Twocoda,2011-05-06 03:47:00,4130,Since my arm is getting tired/sore from fighting fish i thought i would go and catch some more this way ...with the camera...so here ya go                     This was fun capturing these fish but oddly enough i felt incomplete without the rod in my hand  Cheers!!
580102,hawk-eye,2011-05-06 05:42:00,141,Nice gay man guys.....Thanks for sharing
