579834,cuzza,2011-05-05 14:08:00,467,"Read the regs (it's on page 6 of this pdf)  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001335.pdf  Looks like the short answer is that it depends where you're fishing, which doesn't necessarily mean you can get access to the bits where it's allowed"
579836,thebigcatch,2011-05-05 14:15:00,138,I did read the regs and I called the MNR just to see and the girl I talked to all she said was maybe :s it dont say you can't use roe:s and some ppl say you can and some say you can't so I don't know
579841,Spiel,2011-05-05 14:28:00,9065,If you're between Robinson Road and Cleaver Sideroad the short answer is NO!
579846,thebigcatch,2011-05-05 14:40:00,138, Ok that's all I needed to know thanks
579849,cuzza,2011-05-05 14:49:00,467," The regs say ""Whitemans Creek : between Robinson Road and Cleaver Sideroad : Only artificial lures may be used."" Roe is not an artificial lure so you can't use it there, otherwise you're OK. It's really not that difficult"
