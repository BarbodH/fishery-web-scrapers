579839,torco,2011-05-05 14:20:00,656," I have wondered about this as well. If I am in a small stream I just tied it on directly because casts are short and tangles are minimal.  For longer casts on larger streams, I have used swivels and snap swivels. I haven't done much experimenting with this but if you are concerned about the snap swivel deterring fish why not use a micro swivel and attached a couple feet of line before your spinner."
579898,BillsTheBassMan,2011-05-05 17:28:00,932," Hmmm, I never use a swivel and line twist is extremely rare and minimal.  My question would be what you're doing or what rod/line you're using?  One thing you can do with flouro leaders and real small base line is use a micro swivel to tie the leader on.  I'm not sure if the micro swivels I use occasionally have ball-bearings or not since they're the size of a small ant.  As for my favourite spinner, it's the one that my fishing vest has like 14 copies of - hands down the best spinner I've ever fished (and got me my first two browns of the season yesterday in like 49 degree water).  A truly great lure."
579939,Mike Pike,2011-05-05 19:05:00,1332,"My line twist is probably the result of making longer casts( and reeling spinners back in fast current? ).  But the ballbearing swivels make it a non-issue.  I'll either use a ballbearing snap-swivel direct to the lure OR a two-way swivel about a foot or two up the line.  Either one seems to do the trick.  The small swivels your using, Bill, the size of a small ant are probably not ball-bearing swivels since I've never seen 'em quite that small.  Doesn't sound like line twist is much of an issue with you though."
579948,ehg,2011-05-05 19:16:00,2666,I have never used a swivel as well when flicking short casts. Usually wait a few seconds for line to stop twirling before another short cast. Longer casts or trolling inline spinners probably could use a swivel.
580092,Danubian,2011-05-06 03:43:00,65,"Mepps Aglia small size (#0 or #1) Panther Martins small size (#0..#2) Rooster Tail small size - this one used particularly in strong currents and reeled back in just under the water surface generates a ""vroom"" which seems to work very well for some trout species and completely deter others.  I always used a snap swivel, although I know that is very ""noisy"" and the larger, wiser trout get spooked, but it offers the convenience of almost instantly replacing the lures. I didn't get less fish with it than without it, but I feel it in the guts that I get the smaller, ""innocent"" ones. (I know one particular pool where I consistently caught 5-6 inch brookies, although in occasions I seen a couple of large ones - 15-20 inch - and once I witnessed a gentleman than was flyfishing and caught a male brookie of at least 6 pounds if not larger.) I got rid of all the treble hooks from my lures and tied smaller single barbless hooks, using a small loop of 10lb test line, same loop and knot that is used for tying jigs.   Always used ultra light gear and a 4lb test line. That makes even a quarter pounder feel as large as a bucketmouth .  Technique question: do you cast upstream and let it go with the flow,  or do you cast straight downstream and then just reel it back?"

579503,hurraylien,2011-05-04 19:35:00,95,thanks guys for your responses.Another question i have is how many of you use a snap swivel or barrel swivel? if not do you think not having the swivel makes the difference in catching.I don't use one and have friends that do and often even if they use the same spinner i will catch more fish.is there any truth to this?
579526,Rod Caster,2011-05-04 20:23:00,5784,"  I agree with this for brookies...the lighter and stealthier the tackle, the better your odds. I beat my brother out 7-1 last year. He had 20lbs test and a steel leader while I used 6lbs fluoro directly tied to my spinner."
579530,Fang,2011-05-04 20:35:00,1330,"Have made my own for years. #2-4 colorado blades, varied colors, a few small silver/gold beads and a brass body weight Only ever buy branded ones if I need bigger than #4's and then it's Blue Fox and a few left over old Olympiques I have that are used sparingly"
579548,ehg,2011-05-04 20:51:00,2666,#0-#2 Blue Fox vibrax seem to work well in pools upstream. The smallest Panther Martins work real well for resident browns and brookies in the headwaters. Down near the mouth of rivers #3 Blue Fox vibrax seem to catch what ever is around including odd pike.
579827,Mike Pike,2011-05-05 13:50:00,1332,"I can't believe you fish spinners without a swivel and don't get line twist!  What's your secret?  Anyhoo, I spend the extra and get ball-bearing swivels.  No line twist and makes changing up spinners easier."
579838,torco,2011-05-05 14:16:00,656,  I have to agree that is my favorite as well but I like the mepps #1 and 2 aglia as well. I like to experiment but you can always count on mepps and panther martin.
