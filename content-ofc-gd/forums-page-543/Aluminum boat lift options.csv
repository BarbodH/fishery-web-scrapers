580203,GBW,2011-05-06 16:46:00,8460,Hey all.  I have an aluminum boat lift and it's rather heavy lugging in and out of the lake by my self (most of the time).  Is there any options that you know that I can buy to wheel it in the water?  I don't want to take the current feet off either.  Thanks all.  Geoff

580218,GBW,2011-05-06 17:08:00,8460,now that sounds like a plan!

Don't ever put one of those ""umbrellas"" on top. 3 days after install, and placement in the water, it was picked up out of the water.. cleared the dock and was found 1000 feet North of the property! (undamaged)  "

These guys are in Minnesota, but they make a good product. The dealer locator on their website shows a dealer in Belleville.  I met these guys at the Winnipeg Boat Show back in March. They sell inflatable air bags that mount to the base of your existing lift, so you can roll it and float it into position, then deflate the bags and set it in place. Watch the video on the website to see what I mean. It's really slick, and lets you fine-tune the positioning really easily.  Hope that helps."
