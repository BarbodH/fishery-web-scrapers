580020,GBW,2011-05-06 00:40:00,8460,"I would say let's hook up, but two problems are in my way.  1, you are not close to me.  2, it's my 11 year wedding anniversary so I think she won't be to happy with me if I make fishing plans..."
580064,cranks bait,2011-05-06 02:29:00,721,"Being boatless I forgot all about the opener this weekend.  Makes it easier if I put it out of my mind.  That being said, anyone need a netman Sunday???"
580069,Grimace,2011-05-06 02:39:00,2020, Anniversary every walleye opener?  I would get a divorce then re-marry in let's say winternet season. Life is all about solutions.  Problem is this - 1/2 of a 1/2 plus the original 1/2 = 3/4.   That is 1/4 for you.  You would definately have to be on your best behaviour after the adjustment.
580071,GBW,2011-05-06 02:43:00,8460,I'm screwed so I HAVE to miss it...
580079,Grimace,2011-05-06 02:56:00,2020,Hahahahaha
