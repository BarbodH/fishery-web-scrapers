580028,Loonietoon,2011-05-06 00:53:00,1450,This is how it would work out
580029,Loonietoon,2011-05-06 00:55:00,1450,No Problem.. I can handle that also... and food
580061,cwpowell,2011-05-06 02:22:00,265,"I worked at Home Depot for 2 years. And built a lot of customers decks while I was there! Even though we weren't supposed to, they really didn't like that. Thats kind of the reason why i'm not there anymore haha. But one thing I know for sure, the program skeeter is talking about is a great program and a really bad program, some of the people there arent very good with it. but when they give you the quote, usually cut your cost and materials by about 40%-50%."
580062,cwpowell,2011-05-06 02:24:00,265,"If you decide to goto home depot for a design, ask for ken leach at the pro desk, he's a friggen guru. and get him to draw you one up and give you a list of materials. and then buy your materials from turkstra."
579654,Loonietoon,2011-05-05 00:32:00,1450,Boy am I in Trouble now. Wife decided seeing as how I have put off building a new front porch on the house. NOW is the time to do it... Told her I will start in 2 weeks..  I know she will want it done before we start going to the trailer in June and before I can get into some fishing..   What to do??????
579658,spincast,2011-05-05 00:36:00,3279,strain a rotator cuff?   might not be able to cast but trolling and jigging would be good therapy - and you could use the recovery time on the water to draw your plans up. You know you cant start a project that big without mapping it out first
579663,aplumma,2011-05-05 00:43:00,6896,say what the heck time to build the deck....   Art
579665,irishfield,2011-05-05 00:46:00,26272,could tell her the guy that issues permits is off on holidays for 3 weeks...  ..or just get off thy ass and make her happy bud!
579675,vinnimon,2011-05-05 00:57:00,2593,"Send your wife off to a spa for a weekend, Hire a guy to do the work. And you go . All you have to say is TA DA"
579680,mercman,2011-05-05 01:01:00,7054,  Now thats a great idea  If ya can pull it off
579689,GBW,2011-05-05 01:05:00,8460,"order everything you need, incl. food and drinks and hold a deck building party but the beers start at the end (so it get's done and it's level).  still send her out so she doesn't know how many people helped and doesn't have to put up with the noise all day.  then because you got it done so quick and she's happy with it you have a free pass for fishing in your pocket on a boys weekend when ever you need it...  or fake an injury.."
579694,Rizzo,2011-05-05 01:07:00,4754,buy new house with existing deck

579770,skeeter,2011-05-05 03:02:00,1907,"Take the measurments of the size of porch you want , then go to home depot and have them show you some different plans on there computer program.(This program is FREE) Pick the one you like then the computer tells you every thing you need to build it. Wood , screws,spacing,supports ect.........  You can build it!  Or you could hire me to build it for you!!!!"
579773,GBW,2011-05-05 03:18:00,8460,"He (skeeter) works for good noodles.   (you pay NOW!   ) I mean it, much like Big Cliff has a dock party, have an OFC deck/porch party."
579775,Victor,2011-05-05 03:30:00,1609,"""i need to get some ideas for the design and my only way of brainstorming is being out on the lake or at the side of the river"""
579783,cwpowell,2011-05-05 05:20:00,265,Let me know if you need a hand. I can free up some time. Just built a nice deck for a customer of mine 3 weeks ago.

Place it next to Oprah's magazine....forget the name...where women are constantly affirming themselves....
579955,Rod Caster,2011-05-05 19:58:00,5784, hahaha that would make Al Bundy proud.  I do NOT recommend this!! haha
