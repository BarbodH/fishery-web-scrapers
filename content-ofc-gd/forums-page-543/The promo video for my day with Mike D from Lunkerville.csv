578928,Live2fish85,2011-05-03 03:21:00,1633,Hey that's awesome I look forward to watching it. He sure does seem like a good guy and I like how he goes out with a local fisherman and experience what that average fisherman does.
579475,Hellfish,2011-05-04 18:12:00,308,I enjoyed that. Probably the best episode I have seen of Lunkerville

579572,lew,2011-05-04 21:30:00,12766,"Well done, I watched it at 6:00 this morning and it was a really good episode.  Alot of todays fishing shows could take a lesson from Lunkerville."

579893,Mike D from Lunkerville,2011-05-05 17:10:00,14,"A big thanks to Milo for taking me on my first Canadian fishing adventure!  As usual on Lunkerville, we had our obstacles, but we fought it out and Milo put us on fish.  And we finished the day with some burgers and beer, which is always a sweet way to complete the day.  I really enjoyed my time with the Hamburgler Milo and I continued the fun in the editing room.  Next stop: Montreal!"
