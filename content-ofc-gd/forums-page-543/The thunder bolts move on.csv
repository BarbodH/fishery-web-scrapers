579726,Handlebarz,2011-05-05 01:53:00,3790,Well my daughter is happy as the Thunder bolts swept the caps. Yes that is what she calls them LOL
579737,anders,2011-05-05 02:13:00,1168,Bruins vs Bolts would be a good matchup...im happy the caps are done!
579741,chris.brock,2011-05-05 02:17:00,4053,"the playoffs are totally unpredictable, there's been a few crazy series, BOS/ MON, VAN/ CHI, ANA/ NASH, TB/ WASH  St.Louis, Roloson and company look pretty good,  can the Flyers do what they did last year and win 4 straight against Boston? I hope so, I don't like Chara and those Bruins"
579742,Daplumma,2011-05-05 02:17:00,1961,The Colapsatols.Cant believe I wasted the entire winter watching them for this.I feel like a Leafs fan. Joe

579746,anders,2011-05-05 02:23:00,1168,bruins wont fold this year like they did last year..lightening wont strike twice...as for the lightening..they are only as good as Roloson IMO
579755,kerr,2011-05-05 02:39:00,77,"Watch out for the leafs next year, copy and respond all u want but they're improving and will make the playoffs. The bolts are actually lookin real good tho, roloson reminds me of his minnesota days, contender for sure"
579774,GBW,2011-05-05 03:29:00,8460,Ouch! As long as Philly goes out ASAP I'm content.
579966,blaque,2011-05-05 20:54:00,2419,"Its amazing that 3 of the Conference semi final series could be a sweep.  Im on the fence, it makes for a less entertaining series......but im in my glory that the caps are out, and philly and detroit are in a 3-0 hole."
579974,Rod Caster,2011-05-05 21:29:00,5784,"Thunder bolts haha that's good.  What a shock to see washington get swept. I chose Wash to win the cup, but now I think San Jose will win.  I'm VERY happy to see Detroit down 3-0. They beat the Jets on their last game and they might have done the same to Phoenix. Nuts to the Red Wings.  "
579976,misfish,2011-05-05 21:37:00,29133, BRUINS
579978,GBW,2011-05-05 21:39:00,8460,that's who I said would win too when the reg. season ended.
580130,Lip-ripper,2011-05-06 12:04:00,228,"I love it! in a 16 pick playoff pool, I took 5 Bolts and 6 Sharks, if those 2 teams go all the way... $$$$$$$$$$"
580137,blaque,2011-05-06 12:33:00,2419,Boston better get their powerplay in order if they want to hoist a cup. Still dont think they have one in both series.
580434,jediangler,2011-05-07 12:58:00,1923,"The Bruins got two pp goals last night in the final game of the sweep. They seem to be getting better every game and their leading scorer finally scored in the playoffs last night. As long as Bergeron's injury isn't severe they'll take the Bolts in 5. If he's out, then all bets are off and I predict a long series. Bruins vs Canucks in the finals."
