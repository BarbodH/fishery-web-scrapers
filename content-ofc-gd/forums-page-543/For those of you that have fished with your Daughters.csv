575520,Handlebarz,2011-04-23 18:43:00,3790,I love when these posts come up as it reminds me how lucky I am as my little girl loves to be out on the water with me hard or soft she loves fishing.  Well since Photobucket will not load for me I will add my pics later
575524,Joey,2011-04-23 18:54:00,9122,Reminds me of fishing with my dad
575527,Live2fish85,2011-04-23 19:03:00,1633,I can't wait until my daughter is a bit older so that she can fish with me shes only a year and a half but I will being doing my best to get her out this summer with me for perch. I have taught her how to reel by putting a sinker on her little pink rod and casting it down the hallway so we will se and I hope that my daughter loves fishing as much as your daughters and you Joey. The wife isn't into fishing so we will see. So far shes a daddys girl.  Chris
575528,irishfield,2011-04-23 19:04:00,26272,Great stuff Randy... our two daughters are the fisherpeople.. son a rarity.  Then   Now  
575534,Leecher,2011-04-23 19:12:00,7832,Superbe thread Randy Priceless shot on this one for you two    Here's MÃ©lissa at her starting fishing debut:  
575543,Handlebarz,2011-04-23 19:33:00,3790,"some of my daughters early years she liked to hold the fish all the time even for her brother.     She has grown up so much and has become a good musky hunter she uses a heavy spinning set up I have to cast but has not landed her frist casting musky but is well on her way with many musky under her belt already. here she is fighting one a couple years ago.  Fall one mid to high 30""er  One from a summer trip to the kawarth lakes   Here best and a blast to be there for her 49 1/4""er last summer yes she landed this on her own. I am very lucky that she loves the outdoors as much as she does. She is still not ready to hole them I dont blame her at all. "
575585,crappieperchhunter,2011-04-23 21:20:00,2582,Love these posts. My daughter was much more into fishing then my son when she was younger. But that changed when she got a little older  and discovered BOYS   Now she is a parent herself and I'm looking forward to getting out this summer with her and my 3 year old grandson Lucas  Sorry no pictures to share...but I'd love to see as many father/daughter pics as you all can muster. Brings back good memories for me.

575652,bigugli,2011-04-24 00:49:00,6138,I miss those daddy/daughter days 
575687,Beans,2011-04-24 02:10:00,3339, I know you usually have your camera in your bag so make sure you take lots of pics of Lucas...  One of my regrets in life is that I didn't get pics of my kids fishing when they were little (no camera)...  Our Cheryl probably was more enthusiatic about fishing than you and I put together Steve...She wanted me to take her icefishing in January one year and Robert was born near the end of that month...   
575691,msp,2011-04-24 02:17:00,1336,Great thread !   
575726,huey graphite,2011-04-24 04:28:00,362,Great thread Randy and some awesome photos. Fishing is always better when it's with the people you enjoy being with the most.  I've been away from the forum for too long. This is my 1st post in about 6 months.  Here is a pic of my daughter in my boat about 7 years ago. If you look close you can see she has a deathgrip on a minnow. I've had a hard time getting her and her mom to join me on the water. She wants me to leave my boat at an outdoor storage facility this summer so she can park in the garage. I agreed under the condition that the two of them join me in the boat for a day of fishing. 
575731,Banger68,2011-04-24 04:48:00,157,My daughter grew away from fishing at about 6. Hope she comes back around again.
