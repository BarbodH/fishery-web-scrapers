580101,Mike the Pike,2011-05-06 04:41:00,3421, see ya out there Paul
577855,BFSC Kevin,2011-04-30 01:57:00,1351,anyone going? haven't seen anyone talk about it yet and its only 1 week away.
577857,kickingfrog,2011-04-30 02:04:00,8333,So is mother's day. I participated last year and will again.
577861,Mike the Pike,2011-04-30 02:18:00,3421,I will be there Kev Been going since 2004.
577875,BFSC Kevin,2011-04-30 03:02:00,1351,"I've never tried for the event itself but I did go to the opener last year. I may join this year...   I just checked out the weigh ins for 2010, there was a lady that had won three times, all being over 10 lbs. How is this possible if you're only allowed one fish over 63cm per day?"
577879,walleyemen,2011-04-30 03:15:00,316,"Live release, once you weigh it, it is released!You are no longer in possesion."
577947,LeXXington,2011-04-30 15:07:00,1928,"I am about 80% going unless the next 100mph wind storm decides to make an appearance, I have nothing firm planned yet but I should be in hay's bay.  Its always a good fishing trip."
578056,archer379,2011-04-30 22:48:00,277,heading up friday morning this will be the first time on the bay hope the weather is like today
578117,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-01 02:16:00,1351,"I think I'll go find a campground to pitch a tent. Any recommendations? Looking at perfect vue, Mohawk and Bayview Resort right now..  Where are you going mike?"
578119,dhickey,2011-05-01 02:24:00,1038,i know im new on this site but what is this about and where?  pickeral? Quinty?
578128,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-01 03:08:00,1351,
578133,dhickey,2011-05-01 03:32:00,1038, Thanks Kevin looks like quite the gathering. must be alot of fun? mabey next year .
578167,archer379,2011-05-01 10:19:00,277, we are staying at fosters fishing center  not sure if thats a good thing or not.
578190,walleyemen,2011-05-01 12:59:00,316,"Arch i'm a betting man and NOT!Crappy Docks, very shallow And Glen  old man Fosters is a jerk! Just saying!"
578199,Grimace,2011-05-01 14:37:00,2020,"Foster is a miserable old bugger.  Handle him like you would a 2 year old and you should be fine.   lol.  When he rants and raves and storms off, it is awful hard not to giggle and laugh like a school kid.  My father and I have had many a laugh out in the boat retelling our Foster stories.   Needless to say we don't go there anymore.  Everytime we pass the place I say ""Hey Dad, want to pop in and see your buddy Glen?  Or maybe later?""   He always replies ""Maybe later""   we both laugh.  All kidding aside he can really beligerant and difficult to handle.  My dad is as calm as anything and Foster got him to his boiling point.  He might make your weekend a bit miserable but you will have a great story to tell."
578219,archer379,2011-05-01 16:06:00,277,one of the guys i am going with made the resevation. He told me he checked the place out so i left it in his hands (bad idea) the other guy going his parents don't live to far from picton if it gets to bad i will pull out and go set up in there yard
578222,Grimace,2011-05-01 16:19:00,2020,You will be fine and you will have a great time.  If he gets in a cranky mood just don't let him bother you. Lol. Enjoy your weekend and good luck.  I love that part of the bay.
578244,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-01 17:25:00,1351,"After doing a quick google on foster's, I decided to steer away from that place... link"
578352,LeXXington,2011-05-01 23:21:00,1928,I should be camping in http://www.pickerelpark.com/.  I have stayed there before camping and not too bad. Nice people. Good location etc.  Bad points (well not on the site it self but you get the idea)  Wind coming across the bay makes a boat launch tough. There is nothing else close so make sure you pack for everything. They have a store etc but nothing too special.
579234,the spirit of fishing,2011-05-03 23:45:00,141,I'll be out most likely in the Trenton area. Weather looks like it's going to be pretty good so I expect lots people to be out fishing. For those interested there's already about 40 trailers/campers set up in the park area by the Derby headquarters in downtown Trenton. If your out be safe and expect to see MNR and OPP out and about.
579236,misfish,2011-05-03 23:52:00,29133," After those reviews,how do they stay in bussiness?"
579248,danbouck,2011-05-04 00:19:00,4380,I'll be in Lloyds boat
579251,irishfield,2011-05-04 00:22:00,26272,If you can find him Dan.. he's not mooring at the Tip of the Bay dock anymore... so send him a text for directions!
579346,young_one,2011-05-04 08:33:00,620,"Wish I was back in the country for this one, I've been going back to Mohawk Bay for many years, quick access to many fishing locations, the area is mostly know for good eater-sizes."
579372,Mike the Pike,2011-05-04 12:24:00,3421," Oh you will be in good hands with Lloyd ,nice roomy comfortable boat ...as for me Its the Tiller"
579373,Mike the Pike,2011-05-04 12:29:00,3421, I spoke to the MNR about this you can only weigh one fish over 63cms per day if you weigh another and they find out you can be charged.  MTP
