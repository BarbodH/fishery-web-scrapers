579719,GoneFishin,2011-05-05 01:46:00,349," The thing is, not very many people will target lake trout in Lake O. But on the same note, rainbows aren't the biggest target out there either (open water) which is why I ""was"" assuming they haven't done any real stocking recently. You might think there are a lot of trout in the rivers mike but if you had of fished them not even 10 years ago you would understand all the bichin lol. I remember when I was 6 or 7, and I was fishing the creek near my house watching 30 trout swim back and forth across a fairly small pool in crystal clear water! Threw a spinner bait out that was in my tackle box, and let it sit on bottom cause I had no idea what the hell I was doing and sure enough a 3 or 4 pounder swam over to it and sucked it up!  If I only knew how to set the hook properly back then...."
579722,Handlebarz,2011-05-05 01:48:00,3790,Very cool stuff its amazing to watch and help out with these projects.  I was lucky enough to help out and witness this out in BC on the Vedder river years back I lost all the pics but did make a detailed post here I wonder if its still around as it was very cool to be there.
579791,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-05 09:38:00,3761," Ya I kinda see where you are going, but you got to admit, guys did really well out there this spring...talked to a bunch up my neck of the woods...They should of helped the Rainbows years ago and maybe in the next few years again too...Switch it up year after year you know, Lake Trout this time then rainbow for the next 2 or 3"
579795,bigugli,2011-05-05 10:38:00,6138,"There have been regular stocking of rainbows and browns in the western basin with stocks from Normandale. However, the breaching of the dam a couple of years back, would have reduced recent efforts. That and the recent upgrades and reconstruction.   As for trying to put the fish in at night. It all depends on available resources of manpower. I've seen the tanker bring salmon in at night in Pt Dalhousie."
579888,Homer Is King,2011-05-05 16:40:00,305,Found this on the MNR site.  It's a provincal fish stocking summary for 2010.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STDPROD_082329.html  They also have lists for past years.  I don't understand the issues well enough to comment but here are some numbers to through around!
579901,Harrison,2011-05-05 17:31:00,2202,"Great news Ron!  I for one love fishing lakers on Lake Ontario.  I am sure you know what I am talking about Ron.  For those still guessing why they are stocking in lake O, read back to Craig's post he nailed it."
579932,chessy,2011-05-05 18:41:00,610,The atlantics are not a government project. it is a private venture with government approval if you don't like the atlantics complain but not to the  government
579937,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-05 18:59:00,2690, Yupper.  This one has been re-hashed way too many times.
579941,ehg,2011-05-05 19:10:00,2666,One of the most unexpected and coolest catches for me was a 3-4 lb laker while fishing an eastern trib estuary late fall about 25 yrs. ago. These fish should give another person a bit of fun on L. Ontario in the future.
579998,bucktail,2011-05-05 23:13:00,1857,
580000,bucktail,2011-05-05 23:19:00,1857,"I remeber those crazy lakers running the Ganny 20 years ago. All the steelheaders getting pissed off that lakers were running the river at the sametime. I didnt mind it was a fish that wanted to bite! I wish they would increase the # of browns they plant as they dont get blown half way down the lake like the salmon do in the summertime after a big wind. Give shorebound anglers a better shot at trout more often as well. I just wish the atlantics would start picking up, I caught one of the original plantings last year that was probably 14 pounds and the fight INSANE!!!!!! Nothing would be better then lots of big angry atlantics!"
580094,John Bacon,2011-05-06 03:45:00,3277," If it was within the last five years then it was volunteers, not the MNR.  All of the salmon stocked on the Canadian side of Lake Ontario in the last five years were raised by Metro East Anglers and other volunteer groups.  Starting next year the MNR will take back the Chinook stocking and most likely end the coho stocking.  It will most likely be back to day time stocking for salmon then."
579112,Ron,2011-05-03 20:21:00,1683,"I just spoke with the MNR boyz and watched them dump 18,000 Lake trout fingerlings off the Cobourg Harbour. This is their second dumping in the last few weeks. If I'm not mistaken, the first allotment was 20,000 fingerlings.  So ya, the gulls got some, maybe 100 - 200 that is still a great number say at 17,800 the gulls didn't get!"
579116,jedimaster,2011-05-03 20:26:00,3472,"Cool, did you get any pictures? How do they do it? Just literally dump them in from a big bucket?"
579117,Spiel,2011-05-03 20:27:00,9065,"Works for me Ron, thanks for the info."
579118,Grimace,2011-05-03 20:28:00,2020,Cool.
579120,irishfield,2011-05-03 20:30:00,26272,Thanks for the news Ronnie!!!  Is there any reason that they can't work in the hours of darkness so there'd be less loss?
579123,Spiel,2011-05-03 20:32:00,9065," That's the million dollar question Wayne, one I wish they'd answer."
579124,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-03 20:32:00,2690,"I've seen them do the same thing on Lake Huron...cormorant feast.  Too bad the MNR continues to stock species that most anglers would rank low on ""type of fish they would like to catch"" polls.  Lakers in Simcoe, for ice fishing...definitely Lakers in Lake O...considering they live long, grow large, and, absorb huge amounts of pollutants...no thanks.  Not even a great fish for catch and release, considering most are caught in the summer, when they are far from their fighting prime. Just my opinions"
579128,Spiel,2011-05-03 20:35:00,9065,  I'll take 'em over the fall snag fest that they call a salmon fishery....just saying.
579131,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-03 20:39:00,2690," No arguments on that point. However, the salmon provide a great open water sport fishery."
579136,miller,2011-05-03 20:48:00,223,i believe they've stocked some at 50 point recently as well. i know they put in quite a few in the fall because i was getting a few in the marina while targeting perch and theres plenty more kicking around now and i saw a few of them wash up on the boat ramp.
579137,Spiel,2011-05-03 20:48:00,9065, Oh absolutely they do and I do on occasion enjoy it. But I do wish they'd stray away from Chinooks in favour of Cohos. 25 pound plus salmon just don't fair well in the tiny north shore streams of the heavily populated GTA region.
579142,Joey,2011-05-03 21:00:00,9122,That is awesome Ron
579145,craigdritchie,2011-05-03 21:03:00,1586,"The main reason they pump lakers into Lake O has nothing to do with creating a fishery. By showing that they're trying to re-establish a native species, MNR is able to coerce Fisheries & Oceans into continuing to pay for lamprey treatments.  Same deal with the Atlantic salmon, by the way."
579149,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-03 21:06:00,2690," I hear you, won't even fish the Lake O tribs.  Big rivers, or rivermouths for me. As for Coho's...YEAH BABY!!!!  Spectacular fish."
579150,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-03 21:07:00,2690," Great points, Craig!!  I'm not even going there on the Atlantic salmon program"
579176,Billy Bob,2011-05-03 21:51:00,5865,Want answers....Follow the money...always follow the MONEY...
579263,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-04 00:41:00,3761,"Good to hear, the lake trout out there are big and healthy, nice to see more going back!"
579559,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-04 21:01:00,0,"restoring a native species seems like a good idea.  i'll support ecology over ""cronzology"" any day."
579566,Roy,2011-05-04 21:15:00,13728,"Hey Ron, quick, open up Fish ON-Line and see if they have them entered as brookies!"
579571,misfish,2011-05-04 21:29:00,29133,"I really dont get the beef about the atlantic intro.  Ron ,thanks for posting and the addition of the lakers in the great lakes is is a very cool effort by all involved.  My thinking is though,why repopulate fish in water that is so contaminated?Lakers have been known to carry the most mercury levels of all. I have to side sorta,with Frankie. I would fish the tribs, as it,s a place to fish,catch and release,but would I eat them,NO.   Now repopulate Georgian bay and Simcoe,now were talking."
579643,kingofthesteelhead,2011-05-05 00:20:00,140,"Another government waste of money!what happened to stocking rainbows?The last major stocking was in the 70's and the run blossomed to almost 20000 fish for a few years in the ganny.I know it is basically put and take but I will bet some of you folks will remember catching them damn lake trout in the port hope harbour for a few years,they were a nuisance.What fish scraps better and runs up the streams in the spring,RAINBOW TROUT!Maybe should put a few walleye in the kawarthas also but no they are still wasting there time with atlantic salmon.WHAT A JOKE!"
579646,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-05 00:26:00,2690," Thanks Brian, lol!! One thing I want to make clear...I don't hate lake trout...in fact I love them in the winter!!!  Fantastic fish for ice fishing...or in northern lakes.  I just would rather see #1  Steelhead  #2 Coho  #3 Chinook  being stocked for my license $$$$'s, in the Great Lakes."
579648,BillM,2011-05-05 00:30:00,17367,"Brian, we need to work on the baitfish population in Gbay/Huron..  Once those are established, you'll see the fish populations spike up again.   No point in stocking fish if they've got nothing to eat.  I can imagine some MONSTER lakers coming out of Simcoe with all those damn herring though!  lol"
579662,kerr,2011-05-05 00:43:00,77,"I' not sure stocking pickerel in the Kawarthas is the greatest idea since I believe it affects the natural strain already in the lakes. Stocked fish have questionable reproduction rates and i'd hate to see a fishery as good as the kawarthas affected by this. All things considered, the kawarthas have held up pretty good against the massive pressure recieved from the GTA and surrounding areas. Keep pumpin any and all kinds of trout and salmonoids in the big lake though, we all know know its a put and put back fishery anyhow. My 2 cents"
579668,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-05 00:54:00,3761," Rainbow trout...there populated enough, unless you really don't pay attention you should be doing pretty good out there catching them, is it as easy for lake trout? Are Lake trout more superior, in my eyes yes...sure they dont contribute to food money and government income but this dam world isnt about money, one os doing well as as you pointed .....they all spawn in the rivers like crazy...lake trout are sensitive and could use the help...quit ur bichi...oops"
