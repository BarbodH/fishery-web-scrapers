579199,limeyangler,2011-05-03 22:48:00,5204,Dood...i mean Mike...lol...i am sooooooo pleased for you...great news buddy!   That last underwater pic is amazing...love it.
579258,MJL,2011-05-04 00:32:00,2427,"Thanks guys for the comments. Really glad you enjoyed the pics   I bought this one made by Ewa Marine from Vistek for $340 + tax...Seems the price has jumped since then. I think there might have been a sale on them because the price has increased at other stores as well: http://www.vistek.ca/store/BagsCases/243109/ewamarine-underwater-housing-for-pro-dslr-built-flash-up-to-20m.aspx  I also purchased the 67mm Ewa marine adaptor for my lens so it would connect to the lens port. The bracket that came with the housing was designed mostly for externally focusing lenses (which mine isn’t). With that bracket, it's almost impossible to use and take decent photos with. Dicapak also makes a DSLR housing for around $120 in some places I think.   I purchased that Islander back in the late 90’s I think. Still has the original bearings inside (abec 3?). It still gets hard use throughout the season and it’s probably one of the most dependable reels I’ve ever owned. You can’t go wrong with an Islander   For sure Chris. I don’t fish in Hamilton very much myself, but I do like helping out with some of the local fish-ins and carp tournies that are held there. I enjoyed helping out at the Hamilton Waterfront Trust derby last year and hope to be down there again this summer  Cheers & all smiles"
579299,trapshooter,2011-05-04 01:42:00,1234,Great report and some truly fantastic pics!!  Great news from the Dr's as well.
579303,Nipfisher,2011-05-04 01:52:00,2449,Way to go Mike. Glad to hear the great news.  Why does your little piece of paradise have a tire in the stream. That drives me crazy!!!!  I love the rustic tackle shot.
579423,Leecher,2011-05-04 15:05:00,7832,"Excellent news Mike    Glad to hear that it's a thing of the past now Great report, fish and pics as always Thanks for sharing Jacques   p.s. It's not wrong at all"
579458,Spiel,2011-05-04 16:48:00,9065," Hmmmm, I was helping the young'ns there last year and the year before, you know, ""been there, done that, got the T-shirt"".....literally."
580454,hurraylien,2011-05-07 16:04:00,95,nice fish mike and good to hear you are recovering well.hope to see you on a creek sometime.
578891,MJL,2011-05-03 02:28:00,2427,"The last while, I’ve been preoccupied with trout and everything trout (Aside from having to go to work).  During my session of chemo back in February, when I wasn’t sleeping, I was pouring over topo maps, journals, diaries and stocking lists in search of hidden away rivers loaded with monster brown and brook trout for when I was feeling better.  The good news is, 1 session of chemo was enough and I got the news last Thursday from the doctors at Sunnybrook that my latest CT scans, blood tests and X-rays came out clean – I should be cancer free for the foreseeable future.  I would like to thank OFC again for all the support you’ve given me during that rough patch in my life  I didn’t do a whole lot of fishing so far in 2011. I didn’t get out onto the hardwater as much as I would’ve liked this winter. I did end the lake trout season on Simcoe with a small but pretty laker.    I also got to fish with some great friends   Once ice season for lakers closed, I broke out the steelhead-kit for a few short trips. My first steelhead of the 2011.   A friend I made on the river this spring…Is it wrong to wonder how it would taste on the BBQ?   A pretty surprise amongst the bows...A C&R brownie X 2...He liked my jig so much he ate it a second time after a few minutes.   I convinced my dad to get a new reel he really didn’t need (The non-black one)...Technically it’s mine now because I play with it more  – It's still waiting to be Christened (Hopefully not on a chub or sucker)   As always, I spent trout opener with my dad fishing for steelhead. This year, Victor and Frozen Fire joined us.    After we had our fill of rainbows, Victor and Frozen-Fire had a tourney in 1 small creek to see who could catch the most brookies with some fairly rustic tackle...   Frozen-fire attaching his seed-ball ‘float’ to the line.   No brookies were violated during the event...Only a shiner and 1 rainbow smolt succumbed to Frozen-Fire’s superior presentation over Victor's.  With trout season open the last couple weeks, I spent some time on my mountain bike exploring numerous small streams around the backroads.  Beyond getting some intense exercise (which I really did need), I found a number of very sweet spots and caught some very pretty brookies from them.      A small piece of paradise   Bug of the non-blood-sucking-type   A couple weeks ago, I picked up an underwater housing for my camera. After years of watching the fish-eye view segment on the Real Fishing Show, I just had to get into underwater photography. The housing is more like a glorified zip-lock baggie with a glass lens port – Definitely not easy to use and impossible to change settings (or turn the camera on/off).  I took the housing out this weekend to a small trout stream in the hopes that I could get some browns or brookies on camera. Some pics:          Freedom   Hope you enjoyed"
