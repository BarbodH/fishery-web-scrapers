579844,Joey,2011-05-05 14:32:00,9122,"Congrats Peter, looks like you are liking what you are doing"
579848,b2kptbo,2011-05-05 14:47:00,1505,"Yeah I remember the place as a shell, took allot of wrenching to get it going and keep it running, good on ya buddy. Nothing wrong with a steady gig to help pay the bills and few toys along the way..."
579869,Nipfisher,2011-05-05 16:03:00,2449,"Coingrats Peter, After 9.5 years at my last job I just ""rolled the dice"" with a new private venture in hopes of making better money. Let me tell you I layed awake until 3 am (lew o'clock) wondering what the heck I did and how the heck am I gonna make this work? Gone is the pension contributions, benefits, union, and expences (like milage). All to be my own boss."
580123,SlowPoke,2011-05-06 11:54:00,2984,"Sometimes you just get comfortable. I never thought I'd spend 18 years with my last employer. I'm now 6 months with a new employer and looking for another change. No regrets tho because it's been a good learning experience for my next move... in a couple weeks if all goes as planned. The 18 year stint provided stability and predictability. It enabled us to bring up a young family, pay for our first house and get us in to our dream home. At this point we can afford to take a few risks in hopes of bigger rewards."
580133,lew,2011-05-06 12:22:00,12766,"I always considered myself one of the lucky ones cause even as a young boy I knew I only wanted 2 jobs. One was a sailor & the other was a fireman and I was fortunate to spend my life doing both.  I signed up for the Navy the same day JFK was murdered and enjoyed it as much as I knew I would. I spent the next few years cruising the ocean between Trinidad & Norway and everywhere in between.  When I completed my Navy hitch I returned home to Toronto and put my name in for the Fire Dept. Took nearly a year to get on but once I started it was the job of a lifetime and I spent more than 32 years there.  It was a wonderful, rewarding life and I retired at 53 years old satisfied that I'd done exactly what I wanted to do and no man can ask for more than that."
580425,tjsa,2011-05-07 11:04:00,1578,"Well, other than a couple months of being a junior ranger with the MNR when I was in high school, and also operating a side business part time for 10 yrs., I have been employed at Lakehead University for 34 yrs. and haven't even thought of retirement yet. I am having way too much fun at work. It changes every day, never a dull moment. The guy I work with now, he and I have the same attitude. Keep Calm and Carry On!"
