Randy told me he would be making jigs by next week so please check out the website and order some jigs if ya like them .I think the prices are great and the walleye jigs look sweet and the bass jigs will be deadly with a craw or add a skirt and you have dirt cheap flippin jigs here's the site http://www.liveeyejigs.com/  please help out a fellow fisherman get back on his feet."

579241,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-04 00:01:00,1107,He was advertising $3.00 shipping to Canada so I doubt it's UPS but I will find out for sure.

579785,mike rousseau,2011-05-05 05:35:00,4661,Nice jigs ... But I use 3/4 or 1 oz jigs  I wish there was a company that made jigs that looked like live eye jigs but in larger sizes...  All I can find in a large size is northland gumball jig head... They work but the hooks are low quality and the paint doesn't last...  I can straighten the hook with 6lb fireline in 60 FOW
579987,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-05 22:22:00,1107,  I will ask if that is possible for him to make that heavy of a jig let ya know next week.
