579891,Hooked,2011-05-05 16:57:00,891,"I have fished there a few times in the last couple weeks, fish appear to be on the bottom.  I've tried, and several other guys as well, using a float with little success in the pond this year.  In the past it worked mint, but this year the slip sinker is catching most of the fish.  Good luck if you go."
