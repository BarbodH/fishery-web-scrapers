226452,misfish,2008-07-11 21:35:00,29133,"Rod #1 - baitcaster, 50 pound PP, 7' Medium Heavy=Spinner bait Rod #2 - baitcaster, 50 pound PP, 5.5' Heavy= flip,n/worm Rod #3 - spinning, 20 pound PP, 7' Medium= Tube/drop shot Rod #4 - spinning , 20 pound PP, 6.5' Medium=Jerk bait  One question? WHY THE PP? There are places here I would use floro/mono combo."
226454,Rich,2008-07-11 21:38:00,3927,"There's such a thing as ""serious"" bass fishing?"
226475,forrest,2008-07-11 22:14:00,1032,What happened to 4lb test and ultra-light action?
226478,Rich,2008-07-11 22:18:00,3927," 5.5' ? What happened to the other half? lol  Okay I'll stop being a knob.

226491,Dutch,2008-07-11 22:49:00,831,"Hey guys looking for terminal tackle rec's.  Spinner bait - what rod Senko - Jig etc.  If you had only 4 biats to use, what rod would you put it on and why?  All fishing is serious isn't it?  LOL."
226527,Rich,2008-07-11 23:38:00,3927,"Rod #1 - baitcaster, 50 pound Stealth, 6'6 Medium Heavy - Spinnerbait Rod #2 - baitcaster, 14 pound mono, 6'6 Medium - Senko Rod #3 - baitcaster, 65 pound Stealth, 8'6 Heavy (flippin stick) - Jig/Pig or Texas Rig Plastic Worm Rod #4 - spinning , 8 pound mono, 6'6 Medium - Topwater Bait or crankbait (tube if I'm fishing smallies)  Reason for putting the senko on the mono is I usually bust them out in clear water and I feel more confident in catch clear water bass on mono than I do with the more visible braided lines."
226551,Canuck2fan,2008-07-12 00:23:00,1444,With line that heavy you must be in a tournament or something. I NEVER use more than 6lb test which is HI-VIS green got to give the fish a chance...
226556,misfish,2008-07-12 00:35:00,29133," Theres that ""NARROW MIND"" I am so laughing right now. What gave you that idea C.?  You would be surprised how many guys fish with floro/mono. Lots of guys use  braid,then tie in floro as their leads. I for one tried it,but not much into reties,so I go straight."
226560,Rich,2008-07-12 00:46:00,3927,"For the bass like in your avatar that's fine C2F,  However I'd bet my paycheck if you hooked a slop bass 75 ft back your 6lb test would award you a lure donation to the lady of the lakes."

226608,JohnF,2008-07-12 02:27:00,3494," When I started I assumed that it was more sporting to use very low test line and puny rods. The more I fish, and talk to other fishermen, the more I realize the fallacy in that thinking. I can cast 35# braid at least as well as 4# mono, get almost as much length on the same reel, drag lures (and fish) through much thicker weeds, and get the fish I catch in quicker so they can put back into the water sooner and with a lot less stress on them. There's no arguing that there's a high degree of skill involved in using light line well, but I just don't see now where the advantage is in it for the fish, only bragging rights for me.  JF"
226617,modny,2008-07-12 02:44:00,502,"i enjoy bass fishing with a 8th oz jighead and twister on 4 lb flouro with a UL rod and 750 reel  if my line breaks, she goes..  beats workin"
226736,Canuck2fan,2008-07-12 16:19:00,1444, LOL you are probably right but then I make it a point to avoid fishing slop for bass.... no need to play in the weeds where I live. Then again I only got 8 today in 2 hours so what do I know.  I just can't imagine needing anything heavier than 12lb mono though even in heavy slop don't let the fish rule you I say you rule the fish LOL.  BTW I landed what everyone said had to be a 30lb carp on my trusty 6lb test the other day LOL I was praying for the dang line to break but it wouldn't.
226740,Burning Babies,2008-07-12 16:54:00,150,"I never pair down to less than five rods, but here is what I use in that situation:  Rod #1 - baitcaster, 20 pound flouro, 6'6"" Medium Heavy - spinner baits, frogs Rod #2 - baitcaster, 20 pound flouro, 6'6"" Medium Heavy - bass jigs, worms, flipping tubes, sluggos Rod #3 - baitcaster, 12 lb mono, 6'6"" Medium - large topwaters, crankbaits Rod #4 - spinning, 10 pound fireline with 10 lb flouro leader, 6'6"" Medium - Tube jigs, finesse worms, light (1/8 - 1/4 oz) Carolina rig Rod #5 - spinning, 10 pound fireline with 10 lb mono or flouro leader, 6'6"" Medium - jerk baits, smaller topwaters and cranks   I've landed plenty of big fish in open water on light tackle, but a 4 lb bass is going to make a mockery of 12 lb test in slop."
226757,bassjnkie,2008-07-12 18:32:00,1101,"Ok. I carry 11 rods with me 7 baitcasters and 4 spinning.  If I can only carry 4, then,  1 - Baitcaster - 7' Medheavy weightless or weighted senko, fat tube, chuky soft jerkbait, even buzzers and spinnerbaits. 30lb pp 2 - Baitcaster - 7'6"" xtra heavy non telescopic(it's lighter) for a spro frog or pig 'n jig 50lb pp You mentioned 2 spinning. so, 1 - spinning - 7' med fast, small light plastics, crankbaits, spinners 10lb suffix G2 2 - spinning - 7' med, jigs, twistertails, light all around tackle, 12lb suffix G2  Personally change a spinning outfit to another baitcaster 50lb pp for spinnerbaits with a 7' med-heavy.
