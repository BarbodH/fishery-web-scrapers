226220,ccmtcanada,2008-07-11 14:49:00,7971," Braided line is much thinner than mono for the same line strength.  For example, 30 pound power pro is about the same diamter as 8 pound mono.  I like braided lines for a few reasons...  1) No stretch (mono has quite a bit of stretch), enables you to detect hit more easily 2) If you fish in weedy areas, you dont have to worry as much about line break..the line will just rip thru those weeds. 3) Smoother casting.  Braided line wont ""coil"" up on you because it has no ""memory"" when it's on the spool.  Others prefer mono line, for their own reasons, but for me, for casting and retrieving, braid is what I prefer.  For jigging I actually like mono line...it's less visible in the water and I don't have to cast with it.  Good luck!  Hope to see a fish filled report soon!"
226230,Zubris21,2008-07-11 14:58:00,563,"If you're looking for an alternative to both braided and mono, try out some copolymer line.  I bought it a while back and put it on my rod only a couple weeks ago.  Before that I had just been using Trilene low vis. Green mono in 8lb. The copolymer is much stronger than that mono, but wont break the bank like some braided lines.  Easy to use, holds knots well, and little memory so far.  The one thing I found though, is that initially it had a lot of line twist, only for the first day really and this might have been how I spooled it.  anyways all I did to correct it was let all the line out behind (no lure attached) then reel it in through the resistance of the water.  (Im sure this could also be done along a bank).  Here is a link to the kind I have, 10lb test has shown little abrasion or colour fading, and I can cast it a mile!  http://www.p-line.com/product_detail.php?id=602"
227123,Trax416,2008-07-13 20:36:00,10,"Thanks for all the info.  I will pick up some braided line, maybe one of each type and see how I like them.  I am going to be moving about 2 minutes walking distance from cooks bay in a month, so hopefully there is some good fishing there.  Thanks again for the help guys."
225785,johnnyb,2008-07-10 15:06:00,3413,"Great combo, but my vote is for the 7 footer, considering you want to be targeting pike.  And welcome back to fishing!!!"
225786,Zubris21,2008-07-10 15:07:00,563,"    I also would go 6,6' as opposed to 7.  might not be able to cast quite as far, but you get a lot more control."
225834,Burning Babies,2008-07-10 16:53:00,150,"Yeah, if I was targeting pike a lot, I'd look to up the power of my rod to medium heavy, rather than increase the length.  Of course, a medium heavy spinning rod is much less versatile tool than a medium."
225919,Trax416,2008-07-10 19:42:00,10,"Thanks for the tips guys. I think I will go for the 6'6 rod instead of 7. Though I might catch some pike, I will mainly be going after Bass. However I am sure a Pike will grab what I through out there eventually and want to have something that could get the job done if that happens.  Also, I am not just going to go for Hardbaits. I heard Senko's are very good if you texas rig them. So I think I might pick up a couple 10 packs of those.  Also what type of line do you suggest? I am thinking 12lb test, but I am not sure what brands have less memory then others."
225923,Reef Runner,2008-07-10 19:54:00,980,"Welcome to the board BigD and nice seein ya back to the sport.  As mentioned your rod and reel combo is a good choice.  For the line I would recommend 20pound test power pro (""PP"").  This line a little to no stretch and is very durable.  When spooling your reel with PP, first start with a monobacking, this will help against line twisting around the core of the reel itself.  20# PP has an equivalent diameter to 8# monofilliment.  Use any Mono (I like the trilene or rapala stuff).  Tie mono to the core of the reel and spool just enough for a good base.  Now the tricky part, hehe.  Use a uni-to-uni knot to tie together the mono and braid together.  Do a search on here and you may pull up some diagrams, or try google.  Then simply spool the rest of your reel with the PP.  You won't be disappointed.  Hard Baits My personal favourite is the xrap.  casts like a dream and has a nice wiggle to it.  Very versatile.  Ripplin redfins and shad raps are a good choice to own as well.  WARNING It's easy to break the bank when at a tackle shop.  lol.  I know from expeience.  Best of luck this year and be sure to let us know how you do.  reefrunner"
225924,Burning Babies,2008-07-10 19:58:00,150,"A medium action spinning rod should be fine for handling even large pike as long as you don't horse them.  My biggest fish so far have been a pair of 36"" and 37"" muskies which I caught on the same medium light rod.  As long as they aren't near a lot of heavy cover, just let them take line and tire themselves out.  I mostly look to heavier rods for pike to let me cast larger lures.  I wouldn't go over 10 lb test if you are fishing with mono.  My choice for a beginner would be 10 lb superline.  I have used mostly Fireline for years, but there are a lot of good options, including Spiderwire and PowerPro."
226107,Trax416,2008-07-11 06:16:00,10,"Alright here is what I am going to pick up so far.  -The 6'6 medium Action rod/reel combo from Basspro. - A Rapala X-Rap Shad - Rapala X rap - Bass Pro crankbait kit - 2 packs of Senko's 5 inch - 2 packs of Mustad Big Mouth 4/0 hooks - 17 piece Spinnerbait kit by Strike King - 10-12 pound mono line (not sure what brand as of yet). - Tacklebox  (I have knives, pliers, net etc..)  Eventually I will pick up a fair amount of other stuff, but I think that should get me started for now.  Does anyone have any type of knots they recommend. I have been practicing the grinner knot."
226115,ccmtcanada,2008-07-11 10:26:00,7971,"If Pike are on your agenda and you are using mono line then, wire leaders are a must to add to your list.  You are doing well on your list...the only thing I'd change up is the line....I'd go at least 20 to 30lb power pro.  Casting 10 or 12 lb mono line will be tough...especially for lighter lures.  Get basspro to spool your reel for you if you are not comfortable doing it yourself.  Also to keep in mind.  Simple float, hook and worm (and splitshot) shouldn't be overlooked....it'll catch you all kinds of fish."
226176,Trax416,2008-07-11 13:44:00,10," Alright sounds good.  For my reel it says under ""line rating"" 4-12lb.  I figured that meant the maximum and minimum line I could use with it. Didn't know I could use 20lb."
226190,JohnF,2008-07-11 14:00:00,3494,"As a relatively recent returnee myself, after a hiatus of about 50 years, let me humbly add a few observations:  Just my two cents worth of pontification JF"
226195,Reef Runner,2008-07-11 14:08:00,980,Palomar knot is a must!!! Strongest knot IMHO.  http://www.animatedknots.com/palomar/index.php  Pretty good site for knot tying.
