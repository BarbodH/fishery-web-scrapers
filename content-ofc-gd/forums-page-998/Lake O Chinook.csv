After a slow start, I was finally into my first fish.  He took a flasher/herring combo, and he weighed in at 26 pounds!  After some smaller fish, and a few good sized fish lost, we managed to land another large salmon.  This time, the scale read 27 pounds, 15 ounces.  We seriously considered taking it to the weigh scales, but guessed that it would fall just short.  Regardless, a great fish and the biggest of the season thus far.  At one point, he had 540 feet of line out!  He was taken on a black/crushed ice Rac, which popped 3 fish today!  At the end of the day were 7 for 9. 28 lbs 26 lbs 18 lbs two around 12 lbs 6 lbs 1 lbs A day well spent"
