I realize that the only printed maps that have depths are not available for the river below the Chaudiere dam. I'm looking for good tops without depths, but will help locating bays and marking spots.  Also, I was in Quebec fishing LG4 week before last and out guide had a Garmin handheld that was quite impressive with very good mapping of LG4 (not depths).  Any idea where to get these? I've looked on Navionics website and  they don't provide a lot of info on the above areas."

If you contact the MNR for Sudbury, you can get detailed paper charts of sections (about $60), and I think you can use Fugawi software to scan them in and scale them.  http://www.fugawi.com/web/index-ca.htm"

227105,camillj,2008-07-13 19:55:00,1988,Mapcreate 6 - Canada Topo maps - AWESOME ... every little brook and pond ... no depths but VERY accurate ... I use it in the mountains in Quebec and it shows all the islands and bays - and the elevations are very helpful too.  I got mine on the 6 CD version and you can create the maps you want for your handheld and even add your routes and waypoints before uploading to your chip.
227124,Guest lundboy,2008-07-13 20:41:00,0, This might help you out:  You may still be able to buy a copy of a huge platicized map of the French put out by Ontario Parks. It covers all of the French River and some of it's history. Kim may still have some in her store at the corner of 69 & 64.  No Depths but lots of shore and contours pretty detailed actually.  Again you would have to scan and scale.  It looks like this: Reduced 89% 		http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ost&id=6960
