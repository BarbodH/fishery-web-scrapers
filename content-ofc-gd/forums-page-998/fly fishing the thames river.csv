There also a ton of bait fish in there right now....l did hook a big channel cat  on a willy bugger which was a hoot. thats a first for me on a fly rod!
226511,JohnF,2008-07-11 23:14:00,3494, Wasn't it pretty well muddied up and running high? I looked at the Avon overflowing it's banks in Stratford and figured the Thames would be a mess all the way down.  JF
226517,steelheader42,2008-07-11 23:20:00,44,No not at all here in London its right down. l was wondering if they might have closed fanshawe dam maybe cause it has really droped!
226553,danbo,2008-07-12 00:28:00,2646,How big was the cat?
226566,steelheader42,2008-07-12 00:54:00,44,About 7 or 8 lbs not bad for on a fly!
