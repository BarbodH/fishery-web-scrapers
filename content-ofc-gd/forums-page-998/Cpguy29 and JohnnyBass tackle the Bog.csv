Now with a name like JonnyBass I'm thinking he must know a thing or two about bass fishing, Well it wasn't long before he lived up to his name....       Oh no the WGSF! Is the legendary JonnyBass destined for a day of fighting rockbass...    I don't think so...      It was a good day...30 plus bass a small muskie and several muskie follows.        "

And the musky we seen in the shallows. Also the 2 you lost and the one follow I had!!!!  It was great fishing with ya Jeff, Gotta do it again soon!"

226980,cpguy29,2008-07-13 12:13:00,148,"  Yes...two lessons were learned...pickeral are very slippery and never listen to the Weather Network! There was that one point in the afterenoon were the musky seemed to tun on. The boat beside us nailed one, then Johnny had a follow and then I had one try to smash my spinner bait beside the boat...all within like half an hour."
