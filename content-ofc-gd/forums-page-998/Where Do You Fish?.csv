226625,ccmtcanada,2008-07-12 03:10:00,7971,This is our first season with a boat.  I'd have to say that Sturgeon Lake is my fav lake that's close to home.  Scugog comes in second...only because it's even closer to home.  I loved fishing the West Arm of Lake Nipissing...learning that lake after a few trips up there.
226633,JohnF,2008-07-12 03:49:00,3494,"Lately the question would be ""Where do you wash lures?"" and I'd say ""The Thames"". I think one should be catching something to call it fishing.  JF"

226759,Burning Babies,2008-07-12 18:43:00,150,"I fish mostly Nimisila Reservoir in north-east Ohio.  I've been meaning to hit the Portage Lakes nearby, but the zebra mussels are keeping me away, as well as Mogadore Reservoir."
