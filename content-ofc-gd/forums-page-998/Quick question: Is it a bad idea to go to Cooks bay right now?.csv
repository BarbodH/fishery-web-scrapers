226827,Victor,2008-07-12 22:18:00,1609,"Hi guys and girls,  I'm thinking of heading out to cooks bay tomorrow for some boat fishing. As the title said, would it be a bad idea to go? Is there dead carp floating everywhere?  Thanks,  Victor"
226828,misfish,2008-07-12 22:25:00,29133,The die off seems to be slowing down Vic. Where were you planing on launching out of?
226829,bassman,2008-07-12 22:26:00,384,I was out this morning and it didn't appear as bad as last week. There was some weird looking boat out there picking up carp carcasses.  I'd say go for it.
226832,misfish,2008-07-12 22:32:00,29133, These are the boats that stripe the weeds from Marinas. They have a conveyor on them. Good job I say.
226834,Trax416,2008-07-12 22:36:00,10,"DOn't really want to hijack the thread, but I have been looking at a few waterfront or near waterfront homes on Cooks Bay. I was wondering is the fishing good there?"
226842,modny,2008-07-12 22:56:00,502,do u think its safe to consume a carp out of cooks bay right now? i'm getting hungry for a nice carp burger
226845,misfish,2008-07-12 23:01:00,29133," If you got a boat that can travel,then you wont have to worry about staying in Cooks.Simcoe offers much. Cooks offers aswell,dont get me wrong.  Please.pull up a seat and fill yer face."
226937,Victor,2008-07-13 02:42:00,1609,"I'm planning to launch at the very south end of the bay, heard that there's a public launch there ... with the high gas price and limited time to fish tomorrow I'm hoping to do some exploring there as it's much closer to me compared to the Kawartha Lakes.  I guess I'll give it a shot. Thanks guys!"
