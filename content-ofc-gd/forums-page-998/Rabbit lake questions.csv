226706,johnnyb,2008-07-12 14:21:00,3413,"Call or email Jim at Dad's Outdoor store in Temagami.  Click here and read his latest fishing report.  If nothing on Rabbit is in there, you can check with him...he even has some nice laminated maps of the lake for you. Not to sound like a shameless plug...it's just that he's a great guy, and has helped me find some fish in the area on more than one occasion. Good luck!"
