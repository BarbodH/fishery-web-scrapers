226971,brickNblock,2008-07-13 11:12:00,598," Well said......Hope its listened to.  NewAngler...I, like many others spent countless hours researching most all equip. we purchase then if opinions are still required you should pretty much have it narrowed down and know of what you ask."
226982,boatman,2008-07-13 12:22:00,350,I think the best deal right now is the Eagle 320 Fishmark at LaBarons. They have it for around $170. You won't find that price anywhere else.
226983,forrest,2008-07-13 12:23:00,1032,"Yep, researching is the best way to go.  For example I think they have a basic fishfinder for $70  (Eagle Cuda 168)at Bass Pro (online only) that is not a bad choice.  Guaranteed you will spend $130 at BPS and end up with the same unit quality.  There are lots of posts on buying a fishfinder around.  A lot of people like the Lowrance x97 and the new Fishin Buddy series (not the old fishin buddy series) looks really good if it suits your application.  Research the item you will have to live with it.  forrest"
227000,bigbuck,2008-07-13 13:02:00,2449,"The Eagel FishMark 320 is a good unit for the price but, for $180, I don't think that there is a unit with the speed sensor. Pay extra for a good unit and save a few bux to buy the speed sensor later."
227005,boatman,2008-07-13 13:11:00,350,I meant to add that the speed sensor for any fishfinder isn't very good. You'd be better off buying a GPS for that. Even an old used one $50 would be better than a speed sensor.
227008,Greencoachdog,2008-07-13 13:23:00,8163,"I personally like Humminbird brand, but that's just me.  Most sonars are pretty much the same nowadays. What I would recommend is getting one with a wide beam transducer, triple or quadruple beam. It increases the amount of water you can ""read"" with the finder.  A GPS will be much better for speed monitoring, especially for trolling!"
227010,Guest lundboy,2008-07-13 13:32:00,0,"Yes most speed sensors will use a paddle wheel, and will not register very accurately (if at all) below 2 or 3 miles per hour, so if you want to use it to measure trolling speed it's not the way to go.  here's a great deal if you can get it:  http://cgi.ebay.ca/Lowrance-LMS-322-Sonar-...idZp1638Q2em122  It doesn't say it includes the GPS receiver puck, or network cables though.  The unit originally came with these, and could be quite costly to buy separate."
