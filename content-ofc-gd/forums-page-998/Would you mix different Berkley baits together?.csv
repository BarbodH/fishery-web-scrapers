I noticed that regardless of the shape, size and color, same type of baits smell the same! (Goby, shad, minnow and grub smell the same) (Earthworm, bass worm smell the same) (Leech ... I didnt smell anything ..)  What do you say?"
226943,Riparian,2008-07-13 03:12:00,269,"Are we talking about gulp baits here or just powerbait?  Gulp I would not mix but it probably dosent matter.  No harm should come to the powerbaits or soft plastics all crammed together in one bag. I have had the color transfer over a few but they work fine, if not better."
226945,forrest,2008-07-13 03:26:00,1032,Looking for an answer here too.  4 guys buy 4 different Gulp buckets.  They can only buy one bucket each because they cost a fortune.  The 4 guys go out fishing and want to trade Gulp baits so each has a mix of 4.  Back to the original post.  Can the baits be mixed?  forrest
226950,Weeds,2008-07-13 04:01:00,782,A word of caution. Berkley has intentionally designed the product to react in a manner very similar to the mentos in a coke bottle phenomenom. Putting a Gulp shiner in a Gulp Shad solution will cause a violent gyser like explosion; expelling the entire 20 dollars worth contents of the tub and soaking each angler in oh so tasty GULP!!!l Try it and you'll see.
226981,forrest,2008-07-13 12:16:00,1032, Its sounding like Gulp is Gulp is Gulp....no difference mix away.....my proof of that: some winking guy with a smirk
227001,jediangler,2008-07-13 13:03:00,1923,If you have any of the old red coloured powerbaits they will bleed colour into anything else they touch.
227043,mikethespike,2008-07-13 15:49:00,51,"very good question,  had some personal experience with this a couple of months back.  gulp alive products (the ones that come in a bucket) has a very corrosive juice.  it melted a hook accidentally left in the juice for about 3 days.  also tried placing gulp alive shads in with the ""non-alive"" shad/minnows and the latter lost its color.  my conclusion is:  mix and match gulp products as long as they're not the ""alive"" variety.  don't mix ""alive"" with anything."
