I Will likely be going to see my parents  this weekend, they are docking at Toronto Island for Sat night, and was wondering if it is worth taking gear as I will be visiting them Sat. and Sun. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Jeff"

After picnic, I hit and fished in my spots for a few hours. Water is very dirty.  Caught a big ugly bowfin.  Saw a couple of good size bass and carp around, alot f sunfish plus catfish. Didn't bring live bait. It works much better."
