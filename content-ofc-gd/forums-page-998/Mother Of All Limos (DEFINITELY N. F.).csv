226752,Photoz,2008-07-12 18:05:00,792,"I just happened to spot this coming down through Willowdale this morning, as it passed me . . .     it's gotta be longer than a TTC bus!! And back when I drove limo, I thought it was a real big deal to drive a Town Car 'stretched' by about 8' this sucker HAD to be 35' long! Apparently it started out as a Ford Excursion . .     only 4 in Canada.  "
226753,danbo,2008-07-12 18:11:00,2646,"Now slap some roof-racks on it for the big canoe & we're ""Good to go!"""
226755,Photoz,2008-07-12 18:19:00,792,It should tow a pretty good boat . . .     er r r  r yacht!
226758,johnnyb,2008-07-12 18:32:00,3413,saw that bad boy rollin' down the QEW last week...the front end looks bigger than an Excursion though....looks more like one of the 450 or 550 super duty's
226767,SlowPoke,2008-07-12 19:07:00,2984,"I don't think it is from the Excursion platform. Likely a cab & chassis - light truck configuration. Kinda takes the shine off... ""and this a picture of our limo, we got the entire wedding party in there... It's a stretched dump truck!"""
226777,Photoz,2008-07-12 20:17:00,792,"The reason I thought it began as an Excursion, the driver said ""It started out as an Excursion platform?"" I didn't THINK the front of that thing looked like an Excursion . .     like you said . . .  more like ""a stretched dump truck!"" (Had a set of duals out back the size of a 5 ton?)"
226786,maybe,2008-07-12 20:58:00,307,"One stretched dump truck, coming right up.  Spotted it in a music video a few weeks ago."
226797,Photoz,2008-07-12 21:11:00,792,WOW!! Next they'll come up with a stretched garbage truck!! (For 'sanitary engineers' weddings?)
226818,motv8tr,2008-07-12 22:00:00,2587,"At 35' it's shorter than a TTC bus, they are 40' just for general info....personally, I think it's ugly, but most people think I'm a little odd anyway  maureen"
226820,Joeytier,2008-07-12 22:01:00,3990,What a joke.
226955,HTHM,2008-07-13 04:27:00,4082,"I don't think you are odd, just (fill in descriptor here________________) and be creative!"
226970,pikehunter,2008-07-13 11:07:00,1659,"I have one thing to say.  ""Why?"""
