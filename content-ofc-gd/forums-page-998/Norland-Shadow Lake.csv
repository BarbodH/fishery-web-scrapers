Also how is the fishing there, i know theres bass, walleyes, and muskies - although not expecting much at all  Any help would be great Will post pictures tomorrow, if anything worth bragging about  Cheers Mike"
226995,Rizzo,2008-07-13 12:43:00,4754,i'd like to hear how you did. I've never fished that lake but I do fish Head Lake once or twice a season and Balsam 4 or 5 times which aren't too far away
