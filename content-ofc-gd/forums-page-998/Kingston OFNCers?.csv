Like the city (lived there for five years while going to school) and everybody tells me it's a great place to raise a kid.  Wondering if there are other OFNCers in/near Kingston who would be interested in partnering up for a half-day or day on the water once we move.  We know a few people in Kingston but none of them are passionate about fishing as far as I know. Would be great to meet some other fishermen once we've had some time to settle in.  Mike"

I also have been offered a job and may be relocating to Northern BC as a result.  I don't have a boat or anything, do have a canoe we could get out in if I'm still around.  Either way if your looking for some spots, feel free to pm me and I'll help all I can.  There are tonnes of great bass lakes withing about half hour if your willing to drive.  Good luck with the move!"
