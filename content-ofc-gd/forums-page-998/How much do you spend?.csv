226530,jace,2008-07-11 23:40:00,472,  get which?   pod or toneport?     I think i really missed the boat on the Pod though.  I saw a Pod 2.0 with that huge full size floor pedalboard for $300 at a pawn shop.  and i held off on it because it had no manuals.  and of course that was gone the next time i went check it out.

226430,jace,2008-07-11 21:00:00,472,"Just wondering how much you spend on fishing in a typical year?  for new gear, tackle, fishing trips, guiding, gas, time off work (income lost) to fish, etc?"

226447,JohnF,2008-07-11 21:29:00,3494," Recreation is important to the mind, body and soul. If you weren't spending it on fishing, how much would golf cost you. I promise that, other than the cost of running a boat, golf would make fishing look like a cheapskate's recreation. Golf for a day is at least $30 to $50 but usually lots more. If you join a club it'll seldom be less than $1,000 per year plus cart rentals. A decent set of sticks will run at least $750 and that's low, and most of us aren't content with one set for more than 3 or 4 years before we want to trade up.  I can tell you from experience that scuba diving for instance costs at least $60 to $75 per person per day for the boat charter, plus $20 - 30 for air fills, plus travel expenses because the diving is never just around the corner. The gear needed makes fishing look cheap.  If you go away on fishing holidays are they in place of other forms of holiday? Again, money you'd spend on something.  The point is there's no reason in tearing yourself up fussing about what your fishing costs you. If you get your money's worth out of the equipment, the family's not doing without the essentials because of your spending, and you're able to combine family holidays with your fishing, is it really that expensive. On the other hand, if you refuse to share your fishing holidays with your family (or vice versa) and spend an inordinate portion of the family fun money on stuff for you alone, then perhaps you need to re-assess.  Fishing is one of the least expensive forms of gear-centric recreation we have available with the best bang for the buck ratio of just about anything fun I know.  JF"

Skiing & ice-fishing in winter, boats & bikes in summer, salmon & trout in spring or fall. Now if you Hunt as well..archery stuff, guns,decoys,camo...

226504,jace,2008-07-11 23:02:00,472,"I have no kids or big responsibilites so i put as much time into fishing as i can.  As another person put it...I can't take it with me.   On average, i spend maybe $7-8K/year on trips and new equipment combined but the bulk of that is on a fishing trip which i've been doing annually or semi-annually since the mid 90's.    I'll get a few new reels every year, not always the flagship models, just whatever interests me for whatever reason.    The same goes for rods, whatever looks interesting, and i always like to try something new or different just to see...     One thing i don't think i'll be trying just yet are the carrot stix, at least not until they come in other colors.  heh.    I know my income takes a big hit from this but ever since studying economics, i look at everything from the standpoint of opportunity costs (trade-offs) and maxizing ""utility.""     It's a pretty dorky way to see things but I can't seem to break it and it comes up in things i do every day.   The past few years has been a boom for me with the steadily rising US exchange rate.    I think we can do without the 50% exchange rates for a little longer, at least for canadians vacationing there."
226505,jace,2008-07-11 23:05:00,472," guitars and amps.   That was a big one for me while i was in university.   I tried out different guitars, swapping out pickups, and buying effects pedals until i finally settled on a fender twin, marshall jcm800, 3 Boss pedals, 1 digitech, and 4 guitars."

Fender semi acoustic Ibanez Roadstar II electric Yamaha acoustic Peavey Amp 1 Boss pedal 1 Effects pod No name bass guitar for recording  Most of the stuff (minus the effects pod and bass) are over 20 years old and just as good today as when I bought them.
