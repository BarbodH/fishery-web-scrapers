226646,jace,2008-07-12 04:44:00,472,"can't force a kid to like what you like.  How many kids do you know of who were forced to take piano lessons and how many still play after highschool?  As much as a parent wants to see their kids head on a certain direction in life, eventually that child must be allowed to choose his own path.  If not, we would all still be hunters and farmers living off the land in a little log cabin."
226653,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-12 10:23:00,2585,"i think that if you start them young, 4 or 5 they will always like it.  When they get older, 12 13 they start thinking about other things, hanging with friends, playing video games.  then high school and women are on there minds.  Once they get by that stage i htink most kids start to do things that are fun to them again.  People go through phases in life.  Fishing may or not fit into your life, key is let it be his/her decisoon  Cheers!"
226705,johnnyb,2008-07-12 14:18:00,3413,"Lot's of great advice here...which I am finding extremely helpful, so, thanks for starting this post!  My little man is now 8 years old, and he has loved fishing since catching his first sunfish when he was barely 3 years old.  HOWEVER...after trying way too hard, and expecting him to come along with me and be happy to fish for much longer than he wanted to, I am on the verge of ruining a really good thing.  This year, he almost wants nothing to do with it.  Tells me that he doesn't think he has the patience, just isn't something he is into.  I know it's because I've put too much pressure on him, and, after a couple really crappy days ice-fishing, he's not too enamoured with the sport.  Thankfully, he's 8, and thankfully, I've got a wonderful woman who is helping me take it easy with him. The other night, we just took the boat out.  For a ride -- no fishing!  I let him drive the boat (with supervision...an 8-horse on the tinny and small lake), and fishing was never mentioned.  The next day, we went out for another ride...he didn't want to bring his rod, but didn't mind if Jessy and I brought ours.  So, he drove some more, he picked a couple spots for us to fish, and, sure enough, once I was taking a few casts,  I got the ""Hey Dad, can I take a few casts with your rod?""  Of course, I was praying like a madman that he would catch something right then and there, but he didn't, and that was okay too. My new thing is NO pressure....take the opportunities when you get them, and hey -- it really is HIS decision.  He knows he'll always have a fishing buddy if he wants to go.  Good luck to all the parents...for fishing and all the other crap our kids are going to put us through"
226749,bassfighter,2008-07-12 17:40:00,366,"I know that we have to adapt to our kid's personality, some kids can be push while others will retalite if we push them.  I am impress with Successful Athletes like Tiger Wood or Sharapova, their parents push them hard, IF you notice their background and history. Tiger wood, who is a Afican AMerican background, has a military background Dad, the Dad would try to distract him while he is Teeing off when he was being trained, and this makes him tough and distraction during play does not bother him, he can stay focus regardless of conditions. Sharapova Dads was so poor and gave up all his money so His daughter can be enrolled in a US Tennis Academy, Their upbringing and background makes them who they are today.  Today's kid has too many obstruction, TV Video, Games, Internet, Facebook. We overprotect them and they cannot be alone outside the streetfor fear of Kidnapping.  When we wear growing up , we were always on the street , we do not come home until it gets dark. We have our bike and we are gone, I got into plenty of mischief and has to learn from it, and yet we are more street smart then most of our younger generation. TV was not important for us then, We love the outdoor.  I got hook fishing for carp and Catfish when our local creek has them, and we have to go through swamp to find them , there were tons of bugs and mosquitoes, but we never heard of west nile as well, we got bitten but who cares as long as we can get fish , salamaner, snakes, frogs, cray fish, etc... It was fun."
226756,mkeyes,2008-07-12 18:32:00,26,"Wow, lots of good advice....love the beer and ""mens"" magazine comment LOL My sons sometimes come out with me fishing, other times they are too busy playing video games but getting my daughters to come is easy...I ask their boyfriends to come and they follow   and boyfriends just can't say no to the girlfriends mom ha ha  Other times I prefer they all stay back and let me have some peace !!!!!!!"
226813,JohnF,2008-07-12 21:43:00,3494," I've heard that story about Tiger a few times, but the newsguys seem to forget that only a couple of years ago he was being criticized for having rabbit ears.  JF"
226835,mepps,2008-07-12 22:40:00,1301,"If the boy dont wanna fish, dont take him fishing. Just fish without him. At some point in his life he'll either ask you to take him fishing again - and if that day never comes then I guess he was never cut out to be a fisherman.  Then again, I convinced my fiance to like fishing, and shes a VEGETARIAN!"
226838,Greencoachdog,2008-07-12 22:51:00,8163, You did a helluva job there Clive!!!
226465,JohnF,2008-07-11 22:03:00,3494," Hey, I'm no parenting paragon, but if I learned anything it's that every kid wants some space. We can best lead by example, not by force, and hope our example helps steer them in the right direction. When they're younger we've gotta exercise some restraint, on them and on ourselves, but as they get more independent we have to let 'em have their head and hope the lessons we taught 'em work. I doubt there's ever been a parent who was thrilled with everything their kid did, but the important thing is how they turn out in the end, right?  Yer smart to bite yer tongue, at least until you see him really screwing up, and I mean way beyond just ticking you off. Then speak out, but tread softly even then. When there's no time left for gentle guidance it's probably too late. Then the system will have to sort out his problems. It's amazing how resilient kids can be. By that I mean how much deep doodoo they can get themselves into and still make the turn before it's too late. The trick for us as parents is to keep our sanity while the kids try to drive us round the bend with their shenanigans. It's really tough to maintain a sense of objectivity when our own kids are involved.  I can point to several guys my age who have had very successful lives, in every sense of the word, yet when they were teenagers I'd have sworn they were hellbent on self-destruction - booze, drugs or petty crime. Boy, did I read them wrong. And some of those who screwed up the worst were the least likely looking candidates for failed lives when we were kids. Just because someone lives differently than we do ourselves doesn't mean they're all wrong.  Keep the faith, Dad JF"
226468,Greencoachdog,2008-07-11 22:08:00,8163,Pay him to go fishing or for each fish he catches... let him drink beer and look at mens magazines!!!  He'll be begging you to go fishing!!!  Can I come too?
226469,ccmtcanada,2008-07-11 22:09:00,7971,"I have to agree with Raf.  If he's not into it there is no use forcing him.  My brothers were athletic and played soccer, baseball and hockey...and even golf.  All sports my dad was into.  He even coached their teams.  I played a few years of hockey and tried golf, but I wasn't really into it.  He tried to get me excited about it...and I really wanted be excited...I wanted nothing more than to have my dad proud of me, but the passion just wasn't there.  Is he into other sports or in a competitive environment?  If not, then it could be a self confidence issue.  If he sees you being serious about it, then he may back down because he doesn't want to disappoint you.   Then again, he could just not like it...plain and simple."
226470,forrest,2008-07-11 22:11:00,1032,"Some ideas here:  1) fish clear water so he can see the fish......docks, small cliffs and panfish are great for the exercise. 2) make is 100% non-competitive 3) hot chicks 4) Being on the boat all day with your dad may not be so hot  forrest"
226471,Rich,2008-07-11 22:11:00,3927,"Some kids like sports, some kids like video games and tech stuff.. and very few kids - love fishing."
226496,Beans,2008-07-11 22:52:00,3339,"If I hollered...""who wants to go fishing with dear old dad ""...I had to stand back or get trampled in the stampede from my second oldest son and my daughter... Our first born liked fishing as long as there was fast action...if it was slow he would rather be elsewhere...  Unfortunately my daughter died of a rare disease eleven years ago...but oh my, how she loved to go fishing...  Maureen (my step-daughter) has just taken up fishing seriously in the past five years and I couldn't be happier...Hell, she owns more and better tackle than I do...That last baitcasting rod she won that Speil made is a beauty...too bad she lives so far away from here or we probably would be out in her boat every chance we could...  Don't know how to entice kids to like fishing...take them when they are young and hope they get bit by the bug..."
226498,JohnF,2008-07-11 22:56:00,3494," You're right. We had to let the boys find the things they wanted to do and then encourage them in those things. If I wanted to spend time with them I had to take an interest in those activities. That's how my wife and I came to play golf, and really like it. It was just a way in the beginning for us to do something with the boys, but it was their idea first. Truth of the matter is that the kids don't always want us doing everything they do. They want a life of their own, something that's exclusively theirs. As much as we'd love to spend more time with them, it ain't gonna happen naturally. Those who are lucky enough to have their kid want to share an activity should just be thankful and get the max enjoyment while they still can. If your kids don't want to play games with you then respect their privacy and let them do their own thing. Too often the reason the kids are doing the things we hate is because they know we hate it and won't likely try to share the fun.  JF"
226546,misfish,2008-07-12 00:14:00,29133,"WOW If I was a writter like you,those would of been the words, I would of spoken. TY JF I do bite my tounge,but I do also let loose the lion, when need be. The ones I have pounced on,do not come around,and when I ask not,they do not. Im not sure if it,s the wrath they know that will come,or if my stories of my past that make them come around. I have been thanked by some,but others think it,s bu l l c hit,until it happens. My youngest I feel knows the limits,he,s been there and Im sure he dont want to go back. This is why I dont push. I and him,are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. "" hellbent on self-destruction - booze, drugs or petty crime."" I was one,turned out prety good I think. Thats why I tell them my story.  Keep the faith, Dad and all the dads."
226585,bassfighter,2008-07-12 01:36:00,366,"I am impress with so many wise parenting advice here.  I try my best to make it a pleasant trip everytime he joined us, I will fish against the wind or place where it is hard to cast, he is obedient and patient most of the time. Onc ein a while whe th ebite is slow, he might lose his patience and when I challenge him to catch his last fish before we go home, he always manage to get one when it comes to pressured situation. I have tested him in other sport and if it comes under pressure, he was able to peform.  Conclusion: I will try not to be pushy and even cut down on some days when he really feels not in the mood to go fishing. I tried to show him the video of the angler without any limb, to encurage him that for those who puts their mind into it , nothing is impossible. That video always reminds me ""never say it can't be done."""
226605,JohnF,2008-07-12 02:17:00,3494," Show him ""A River Runs Through It"" and if he's got any romance in his soul he'll be hooked, or else he'll become a degenerate newspaperman.  JF"
226628,stasbrute,2008-07-12 03:14:00,206,"I did not like to fish at all when I was little and now it is a an addiction,  didnt start liking it untill I was 14 or so. My son has uttered the words ""I hate fishing dad"" (very painful), however he is twelve now and the other day at Balsam Lake as I prepared to head out with my buddy and  his two sons for some evening Walleye he said"" I am coming along""  (I acted aloof and said ""if you want sure"", inside I was saying YES!!!!). He out fished all of us 4 great fish, kept one for his Grandpa.  I told him I was very proud of him rubbed his hair (holding back tear) and he said thats great dad can we go in now. Any way I overheard him telling his buddies how great it was to out fish his fishing crazy dad. Kids they are all different. (my youngest, my little girl loves to fish so there you go)"
