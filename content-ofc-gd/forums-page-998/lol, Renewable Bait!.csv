After a while though, it grew a film on top of the bucket and attracted a ton of fruit flies. So I drained most of the water and the bucket has just been sitting outside.  I look at it today and there's a bunch of sprouts in the bucket. LOL we have new corn growing in our maize pail! Woohoo bait growing for next year, LOL  Has this happened to anyone else? I'm thinkin' I might have done something wrong with this stuff. I thought it would need dirt to grow.. guess not? lol"
226370,Victor,2008-07-11 19:25:00,1609,"interesting lol. can we see some pics? ahha  you didn't cover it up? I found a bucket of maize left over from last year a few weeks ago. (i thought my dad threw it out, i guess not lol) There was a big piece of white stuff at the top ... looked like a white pie or something. It was disgusting... but i dumped that out... washed it down a few times. Now it looks as good as new!  When you are storing it ... make sure the water covers all the maize."
226374,Rich,2008-07-11 19:36:00,3927,"Since I've got nothing but time today, here's a couple pics. lol  No I didn't cover it.. how would corn grow if it was all shady? hahaha    "
226378,SlowPoke,2008-07-11 19:41:00,2984,I left a couple Super Shads alone in a candle lit room with a Barry White CD playing. I think you're on the right track with the corn.

226408,bassjnkie,2008-07-11 20:27:00,1101,"That is not the maize growing. When they process the maize other seeds get in and that is what you have growing in your bucket. The maize looks great just cover with water or use it. The more it smell like alcohol the better.  One thing you should know though, sugar accelerates the fementation process, so try not to over do it. For the bucket you have there all you need is a cap full of scent or 2 table spoons of sugar.  Get out there!!!  Daniel"

226423,oxcowboy,2008-07-11 20:50:00,544,"looks like grass to me, but it could be the corn sprouting.  the seed itself stores enough food energy to get it to sprout without needing soil.  jason"
226534,wallyboss,2008-07-11 23:43:00,1095,Rich leave it out in the sun for a couple of weeks and then it might be pretty good moonshine.
