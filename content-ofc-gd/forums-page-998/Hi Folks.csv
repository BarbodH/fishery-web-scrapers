226041,CoolB,2008-07-11 02:02:00,47,Sorry I don't have a fishing report. I just stopped by here today for the first time in probably a half a year or longer.  So how is everyone doing?  Long time no talk. Maybe some time Kronik and I will be able to get up to the Crayola Crew Invitational again.....it's been far too long since I've been to Lakair.  For those of you that know me you will most likely be surprised to hear I have a baby on the way. So unfortunately that will make it even harder to get on here then it is now.  Cheers all
226049,Joey,2008-07-11 02:18:00,9122,"Hey Aaron, how the heck ya been buddy?  A baby, OMG, you've been busy then  You should give us a call and we'll head down to Niagara or you could come up this way and we'll take ya out on Simcoe for the day.  Come by here more often stranger.  Joey"

I'm not sure when I'll be able to hook up but maybe someday you'll just get a surprise call from me and I'll be over to visit for a week....lol...jk. It's been a while since I have been back to Richmond Hill. It's hard to leave my nice quiet property here to come back to the concrete jungle."
