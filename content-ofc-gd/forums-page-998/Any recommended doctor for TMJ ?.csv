226648,mikeymikey,2008-07-12 05:27:00,376,Hello.  I am wondering if any is/have had TMJ? or know?  Would you have any quality doctor around GTA that knows TMJ very well?  Your help would be very appreciated.  Thank you.   What is TMJ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandib..._joint_disorder

226670,Joey,2008-07-12 11:53:00,9122,My father had TMJ and had it operated on.  I'll give him a call and get back to you.  Probably on Monday tho as we are just heading out to Paul's parent's cottage today to help his mother with the yard work.  I'll PM you early next week.  Joey
