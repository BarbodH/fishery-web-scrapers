Scarey stuff. outdoorguy61 ____________________________________________________________________________________   18.8°c Partly Cloudy Tomorrow: 28°c Sunny   Four European tourists sport fishing on the Fraser River in Agassiz, B.C., got more than they bargained for this week when they were confronted by an angry man wielding a knife, CBC News learned through an online fishing forum.  The tourists — three from Germany and one from Denmark — were fishing with a river guide on the shore of Ferry Island on Wednesday afternoon, the first day of their vacation, when their fishing lines got tangled in a drift net that was coming down the river with a fishing boat.  Chilliwack RCMP Const. Leanne Dunlop said the man was intoxicated and took issue with the fact that the tourists were fishing on the river.  Originally police said in a written statement that ""the male drifting down the river with a drift net engaged in a verbal altercation with the tourist,"" but Dunlop later clarified that the tourists did nothing to provoke the incident.  ""That person in that boat beached his boat and an altercation [between] the tourist and the male escalated to the point where a knife was produced and threats were uttered.""  The fishing guide eventually persuaded the angry fisherman to get back in his boat without hurting anyone.  A 34-year -old man from the Sto:lo nation was later arrested and released by police. The unidentified man is scheduled to appear in Chilliwack Provincial Court at a later date to face charges of assault with a weapon and uttering threats.  The RCMP said incident does not appear to have anything to do with the ongoing tensions between native and non-native fishermen over access to the declining number of fish in the Fraser River.  ""This particular incident doesn't appear early indications to be at all directly related to any of the history with the Fraser Valley region or with fishing. It appears at this time in our investigation … we're dealing with an individual who took exception to the fact that some fishing lines got tangled in his net,"" said Dunlop.  Post a comment ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Since when on earth is it illegal to argue with someone? The man pulled a knife, the German did not, I completely fail to see where you see this being the German's ""fault"". Maybe they could have kept their tempers, but honestly, attempting to justify that shouting at someone is a legitimate reason to pull and threaten with a KNIFE?  This world makes me just shake my head sometimes.91People recommended this comment91Recommend this comment Report abuseRiverjet wrote: Posted 2008/07/11 at 2:10 PM ETFirst off this story was sent to the CBC from someone that uses the FishBC forums. Secondly according to witnesses what is being reported here is not exactly what happened. Thirdly, some of the comments here are incrediblely ignorant of the facts. Amazing how things get all twisted. The person in the boat was a native that was fishing with a drift net. After observing the tourists fishing he launched his drift net right into the path of where the tourists were fishing for salmon with rod and reel. He then proceeded with his attack. And why it's being reported that this incident has nothing to do with native/non native fishing rights on the Fraser is incredible. It's time something gets done about these renegade natives out there on the Fraser that think it's their river and their fish. This type of incident is nothing new here in BC. It's time our government actually did something about it. If your native you get special treatment for some reason. If your non native you get arrested. Our GOV perpetuates racism in this country and it's time for it to end. One people, one law, one land...............Problems solved.37People recommended this comment37Recommend this comment Report abuseLangley Lady wrote: Posted 2008/07/11 at 12:41 AM ETArrested for what, candido... being threatened by a guy with a knife?"
