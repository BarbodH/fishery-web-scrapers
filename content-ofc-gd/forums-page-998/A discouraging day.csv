227175,Big Cliff,2008-07-13 23:05:00,6899,It's more like Moe is a good woman! To be able to do some little thing for her after all the things she has done for others is nothing but an honor and a pleasure!
227178,MuskyBill,2008-07-13 23:16:00,311,"Atta boy, Cliff....."
227187,motv8tr,2008-07-13 23:51:00,2587,"Thanks Cliff!!!  we'll talk later in the week.  The earliest I can pick it up will be Thursday, unless I get an overtime shift....otherwise it'll be Friday....unless of course Beans wants to pick it up so he can have a boat to play in  Maureen"
227032,Sinker,2008-07-13 15:13:00,8692,"50:1 = 20ml per litre of gas.  Those old johnsons are bullit proof. You may need to replace a part here and there, but they're relatively cheap.  Sinker"
227072,Big Cliff,2008-07-13 17:36:00,6899,"Well, mission accomplished!  Fresh fuel and oil, Seafoam, tweeked the carb (it was set way too rich), adjusted the idle speed, it was set way too low, then took it for a test run, darn thing runs better than my motor does (mind you, I haven't tuned mine up in about two years, too busy fixing everyone elses stuff LOL). You've got yourself a really nice package there Moe, the waves are just bordering on white caps here and this thing handled it beautifuly, rode nice and smooth and got up on plane very nicely, engine just purred!  Anyway Moe, she is here for you to pick up anytime you want, I have parked it down behind the garage so it is nice and safe and it is out of the way so leave it as long as you would like.  Cliff"
227091,Big Cliff,2008-07-13 18:56:00,6899,"Special price if you pick it up before Moe does (Cash only) $21,199.00 (no taxes). (It's Ok Moe I'll only take 1% comission). Get you butt over here Clamp-it it's a good deal!"
227099,camillj,2008-07-13 19:39:00,1988,Good job Cliff ... and YES Mo ... I love those Johnsons ... matter of Fact I bought one from Cliff a couple years ago .. still purrs like a kitten - BUT ... with the fancy new oil they have I normally err slightly on the less oil side ... closer to 75:1 or even 100:1 ... I find there is less smoke and she starts more easily in the dew ... especially when I am spending MOST of my time just above idle trolling...
227142,Whopper,2008-07-13 21:32:00,2174,Your a good man Cliff!
