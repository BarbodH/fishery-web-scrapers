I've used my float rods and heavier salmon/steelhead rods for years and landed fish to 36lbs+ with them.  I've used reels without baitrunners for years and backed the drag off enough to simulate the free-spool nature of the baitrunner function.  Personally I'd recommend not skimping out on a decent baitrunner if you choose to go that route.  I'd stick with Shimano or Daiwa.  The Baitrunner function allows line to peel off the spool during the first run.  A malfunctioning baitrunner can lead you to losing your rod + reel + anything else attached (Like a rod pod + bite alarms - I've seen these go into the drink too because of a malfunctioning baitrunner).  A smooth drag is also important for fighting large carp.  Hope this helps.

Hang on brother, cause when u hook into a big one, you will wonder why u never went after these ""bottom feeders"" before.  This board has been a great source of info for a novice like me.  Good luck and post lots of pics when u get em.  Splashhopper"
227157,Beans,2008-07-13 22:06:00,3339,Before I was fortunate to have been given a 11 ft. carp rod and a baitrunner reel I used a 7 ft ugly stick and a an old saltwater Zebco spinning reel (thanks CPH) which had a large capacity spool...  To hold it in place I pounded a horseshoe pitching stake in the ground and place a 3 ft pvc pipe over it then stuck the handle of the rod into the pipe...then loosened off the drag a lot...    I purposely let a carp run with the rod still in the holder to see if it could pull it out...nope...not a chance in hell...   PM sent
