Next thing I know I have a PM from Paul with the name and number of two companies in my area that can help me. I call one of them and Bingo, guy showes up today exactly as promissed. Checks the stove, finds a patially blocked orfice, cleans it, checks everything out, fires it up and tells me it looks good!  Well Paul, I don't know if you saved another marrige but you sure made my wife want to meet you!  Thank you again my friend!"

I called a buddy here who owns a used appliance shop around the corner. He had a used one one !!! Sent my guy out the back door, picked it up at the store while i listened to her stories about baking pies etc.  Gave it to her no charge, and she just dropped off an aple pie for me!!!"

662402,Nipfisher,2012-02-01 03:39:00,2449,  We used all our wedding money to buy a complete set of kitchen appliances. Kenmore Elite Series. Washer and dryer are only 3 years old.
662410,Live2fish85,2012-02-01 04:21:00,1633,Paul really is a great guy. He has helped me with some things and can't thank him enough.
662445,bigbuck,2012-02-01 14:13:00,2449,A tip of the hat to you.
662508,mercman,2012-02-01 17:38:00,7054," Kenmore Elite series are the same as Frigidaire Elite i believe.The main problem with these appliances, is the lack of electrical protection in them.Years ago, there was always 7 or 8 fuses above the control panel.    	No more. Just a hint to those with electronic controls/digital clocks, if your oven lite burns out, make sure the switch is in the off position, or better yet, open the breaker in your breaker panel.If not, as you screw the new lite back into the socket, as soon as the center contact touches the middle of the socket, you will blow your clock Really smart of them to do this"
