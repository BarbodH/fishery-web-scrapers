Fished two spots, one was 8-12 FOW and the second was 18-20 FOW and the deeper water produced more fish, which is weird because most fish in the past came from the shallow water especially around dusk and dawn!  Most fish were caught on jigs and spoons, with a few fish caught on dead sticks and tip-ups. Friday and Saturday were pretty consistent but sunday was slow with the barometer rising and the colder temps setting in. All in all was a great weekend with the 3 couples and our annual trip.  PS. It was great to meet some of the guys on the OFC board meet and great and a special thanks to Nipfisher for all the info., photos and insight!  Cheers,  EL  First Walleye of the trip!!   The wife's first!!   Nice slot fish released   Another!!   Dinner!!   Puppy!   Girls and the gator that wrapped up 4 lines!!   My sister and her first walleye!   My buddies 26 1/2""!

662257,Rod Caster,2012-01-31 18:37:00,5784,Is that truck on C-Bay? that's quite the rig..I wonder if the ministry of labour has seen that one?  Great fish man! You're doing great out there. My year on Nipissing has been dismal at best so far.
662285,motion,2012-01-31 20:40:00,403,Nice meeting you Jay. Seems you did well over the week-end. Nice to see you caught some good sized fish.  Cheers.
662287,motion,2012-01-31 20:42:00,403,That wasn't too far from where we were fishing. Brian (wormdunker) saw it when he went for a boot in his ATV. Seems it's been there since January 14  Hate to see what that is going to cost him.
