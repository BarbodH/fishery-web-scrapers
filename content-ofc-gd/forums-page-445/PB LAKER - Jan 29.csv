662177,Moosebunk,2012-01-31 08:15:00,3970,Right on Stevie R to the OW botham!  Solid lac truite!
661900,steverowbotham,2012-01-30 13:34:00,1800,"I started the day off on the north side of Kempenfelt and found only 2.5 - 3 inches of ice.  I set up and hooked a small laker which I lost at the hole, but I got SWARMED by people, drilling 20-30 feet away all around me.  By the way, you dont need a gas auger on 2.5 inches of ice, you could probably just stomp through it.  Anyways after I had 10 people surrounding me and water coming up my holes I said to hell with it, and left for a different area.  Met up with a group of friends and headed out, set up by 9:30 ish.  Very slow day, but I did manage a tank of a laker.  I have lost some big fish on Simcoe ove the years, they just always manage to get the best of me.  This time, I finally got the big one.  I lost one last week that was bigger, so it still doesnt feel like a PB but I'm sure she is.  She's close to one I got a couple yeas back, but I dont have an official weight on either.  I need to start bringing a digital scale to confirm.  Caught in 112ft. The best part was watching her swim away!!  "

662003,kickingfrog,2012-01-30 18:50:00,8333,"Ya, I feel the same way standing on the glass floor at the CN tower. Although in this case 10 feet or 100 feet makes very little difference."
