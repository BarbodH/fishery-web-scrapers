We stay away from the crowds in the bay, and walked out to 27' of water before we se up shop. First. the weatherman screwed up again. So much for light snow and diminishing winds. My son finally decided to join me on the ice (YEaaah!!!) and brought a friend who had never been on ice before. Needless to say Rob and the noob got to stay in the hut while the old geezer stayed out in the wind. I would not have minded except for one small problem. The new longjohns wifey got me for Christmas would not stay up and the wind gave me a chill in the small of the back. We had a fairly steady bite, but not the fast paced action of last week. I know I caught over 100 fish and kept a few 9-11"" fish. The boys were having a blast in the hut, and caught a few more than me. Again, no live bait required. Buckshots, raps, the Bug, tipped with various plastics were what we fed the perch, and a dead stick tipped with salties in hopes of a pike, but it kept getting whacked by perch. Jr. You can tell he forgot to get any sleep the night before  His buddy   Rob almost found hiw way into open water, Again, but his bud was paying attention. I forgot how much noobs get spooked on the ice and forgot to tell him about ice noises    Seems he kept jumping out of his seat The drive home was mostly good. A little flurry in TO, then clear skies until we hit Oakville. By the time we crossed the skyway it was coming down heavy. No prob for me, but most of the muttonheads don't know how to drive in the stuff. We all know what happens when you have sports cars doing 150 and meeting  vehicles doing 60 in snow Was fun watching the 2 of them clean fish. Rob's out of practice and Matt never has. At least he did pretty good at skinning the fillets. I made sure I did mine first."
