How often are you going to have a teenager ask you if we can go fishing. He'll be busy enough in a few years with work and life and I'll never get a chance like this.  Temperature overnight : -1. Today +7 and a bit of SUN. Could not be better.  There were lots of cars by Gilford by 9:30am. Went left, 23-25FOW. Plastic minnows until after lunch. Wind picked up. (forecasted for 30km/h). I actually brought out a tarp, and a stick to make a wind break. I drilled into the ice using 2.5"" SCREWS as ice anchors. That's not long enough. We had to repair the anchors every hour due to the softening ice. My DeWalt 18V drill + homemade auger adapter made it easy to carve a few holes.  We had noodles and soup on the little butane burner. Lunch was so wonderfully warm. You can only appreciate these little wonderful moments if you are starving from being outside in the wind on ice all morning  I was annoyed that the bite was so slow. A front did go through last night dumping 4 inches of snow everywhere. So I tried a PERCH EYE.  It was non-stop action from there on. The perch love EYES. Couldn't get the lure to the bottom before it's fish on. We must have cleaned out all the dinks out from under our holes. All 70 of them. I though that if you work through the dinks, you would fine a few keepers. Well I don't think we worked hard enough, because only 1 fish showed up that I would consider a keeper. But it would take too much work to move our little camp so we stayed.  Packed it up at sunset. Then I treated him to some veggie burgers at Harvey's. Only after we came home then he realized that we had been vegetarians all day.  Spending the day with teenage son: PRICELESS  Jiggy "
