661304,Lunkerman,2012-01-28 03:39:00,2,"Can anyone suggest a good ""drive to"" lodge for walleye fishing?  We're coming from the Chicago area - been fishing around Kenora and Dryden, would like to stay within a few hours drive of those.  Mainly fish for walleye, but smallies and big northerns are a definite plus.   Usually do housekeeping package, and spend most of the time in the boat - so fishing is definitely the priority over accomodations.   Any suggestions are appreciated!"
661305,irishfield,2012-01-28 03:43:00,26272,So your mean North Western Ontario then.. not SW?
661314,Lunkerman,2012-01-28 04:11:00,2,"  Thanks Irishfield, I guess I did mean North West (i had just looked at a map and it seemed 'south'...)"
661315,irishfield,2012-01-28 04:19:00,26272,SW would be Windsor!  Lots of choices up there.. many will chime in tomorrow I'm sure!
661319,Old Man,2012-01-28 04:32:00,822,"I'd say look up Highway 72 near Sioux Lookout. Lot's of great fishing up that way and a large number of drive to lodges. Being that I live in the area, I don't have any experience as a guest at any lodges so can't speak to the quality of any of the accommodations or which one's are best.  Here's a link to the Sunset Country resort guide.  My link"
661324,adempsey,2012-01-28 05:08:00,1498,"Here's a few I thought looked good enough to bookmark.   Don't have any personal experience though.  http://www.clarksresorts.com/ http://www.bignorthlodge.com/ http://www.halleyscamps.com/fishing-lodges-aamp-camps-mainmenu-7/caribou-falls-landing-mainmenu-8.html   Have you considered a drive-to, boat-in or ATV-in outpost?  This one looked interesting to me.  http://www.walstenoutposts.com/sep2.html  There are many boat-in and ATV-in outposts in the area you're interested in."
661325,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-28 05:10:00,336,I went to Forrest lodge last fall for my second trip of year.  The journey is half the fun.  Recommend it highly.    http://www.forrestlodge.com/

661495,Pigeontroller,2012-01-28 21:12:00,2793,"For something different, the the French River Delta area...South of Sudbury, Ontario. Try Bear's Den Lodge.  http://www.bearsdenlodge.com/"
661496,BillM,2012-01-28 21:25:00,17367,Going to get out to the Delta this year as well.  Can't wait!
661513,Old Man,2012-01-28 22:31:00,822," Yeah, and if you're there over a weekend, you could go find out what Stompin Tom was singing about. "
661514,grt1,2012-01-28 22:39:00,638,"google sunset country, that should give you some idea of camps that are in the area, if you want to head north of dryden or kenora, try the minaki, sioux lookout or red lake area camps. Each area has something different to offer, some have different fishing regs so you could compare the differences there too. ie: minaki has keep limits that may be different, sioux lookout has a no live well rule."
661695,bigcreekdad,2012-01-29 15:37:00,546,"I fished last summer for 5 days at Fireside Lodge 10 miles south of Sioux Lookout. Fished in late August, and did not expect it to be great. I was pleasantly surprised. Pike fishing was good, and smallmouth was very good. I had 3 musky follows, but no hits. The water has huge, relatively shallow, weedy bays. It is quite unlike the French River, where I go a couple times a year. You also have access to several smaller lakes, but I felt no need to explore further. I think if you went in June or up to Mid July, the pike fishing would be awesome. If I go back, I will go then and use my fly rods.  Camp owners are nice, food is very good, and cabins are fairly new and some of the nicest I've stayed.  Google it for more info, or PM me."
661725,ranksda58,2012-01-29 17:42:00,69,give Moose Haven Lodge a look...bit of a drive but well worth it...giant pike and walleye galore the owners Terry and Carol Petznick are two of the nicest people you will meet  http://www.moosehaven.ca/
661969,Acountdeleted,2012-01-30 17:01:00,2562,"Can't believe I didn't chime in on this yet. Check out Bluffy Lake lodge just outside of Ear Falls. A few years ago I was working there with the MNR, after our stint the owner, Keith, asked us to come back for a weekend, he said if we pay for the minnows and gas he would take us out. The fishing was great, lots of good walleye, quite a few big Northern Pike and the lodging was just fantastic. Keith and his wife are some of the friendliest people I've ever met, always offering advice on fishing spots, lures, cooking recipes or just joking around.  I know they have 3 day or week long packages and I've been trying to find a way to bring my dad up there for about 3 years now."
