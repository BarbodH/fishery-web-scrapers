662109,davey buoy,2012-01-31 00:08:00,5505, I think your missing the attachment?
662116,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-01-31 00:25:00,83,"Nice setup Mikeyfish, sure works well."
662118,davey buoy,2012-01-31 00:27:00,5505, That's quite the setup you have mikey!Also like those tracks on your vehicle.
662119,Terry,2012-01-31 00:33:00,14456,glad someone has found some safe ice
662150,Sinker,2012-01-31 03:08:00,8692,Sweet set up for sure! I'm interested in those tracks. Did you fab those yourself? How cool would my forester XT be with tracks on it....yeehaw!  S.
662167,Mikeyfish,2012-01-31 04:28:00,21,  Yes I made the adaption hubs myself. A machine shop would charge about $1500 to make
662169,adempsey,2012-01-31 04:39:00,1498,Dang!  Now that's what I call an ice fishing setup!
662172,Sinker,2012-01-31 05:23:00,8692," Thats over and above the price of the actual tracks, right?  If someone could make me the whole set up for that price, I think I'd order them tomorrow"
662210,Mikeyfish,2012-01-31 14:00:00,21,"  I had the tracks off my quad and the adapters I built on my chums lathe for less than $100.00, and took them to a local machine shop to get a price for them to build $1500. They said they wouldn't change a thing and would build them the same and they took measurements."
