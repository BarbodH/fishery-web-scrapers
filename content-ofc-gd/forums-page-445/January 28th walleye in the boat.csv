661572,mike rousseau,2012-01-29 00:57:00,4661,Well with all this warm weather and reports of others getting out in their boats this January I figured I should give it a try...  So last night I shoveled the boat launch... Then today chiseled a bit of ice... The boat was in the water around noon...  Since I never fished open water in January I figured we could try some fall and spring patterns and see what happens...  So we tried a couple of spring spots without much luck other then a musky bite off...  Then I figured we should try a spot where I was catching in the fall...  As soon as we showed up we were marking fish... Drop our lines... Bam... Instant fish on... Nice chunky walleye...  After that it was non stop action for about 2 hours...  We ended up boating at least 25 walleye averaging about 20 inches... Biggest was about 25 inches  But the bonus fish of the day was the sauger I got... I've never caught a sauger or seen one in my area... It was 19 inches...  Is 19 inches a big sauger?  Anyways a few families had a fresh fish fry tonight and we had smiles on our faces...  What a day for jan 28th in the boat...  Here's some pics and video clips from the day...  Sorry about poor quality... All done on iPhones...         http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee516/roosnutz/d4a01029.mp4  http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee516/roosnutz/00cd7add.mp4

661577,fishingfarmer,2012-01-29 01:16:00,34,Nice work guy's.Great pics .

661582,mercman,2012-01-29 01:45:00,7054,Awesome Mike !!!!
661583,Skipper D,2012-01-29 01:56:00,1970,"Good go'in Mike , i would be surprized if you were on the front page in the morning , you in your boat out there today had to shock any one who saw ya's . Awsome fish numbers too ."
661599,mike rousseau,2012-01-29 02:35:00,4661, We actually saw 2 other boats from 2 other launches... 1 was fishing and the other was breaking in his brand new bass boat...
661619,bucktail,2012-01-29 03:41:00,1857,"Nice fish and good for you getting out here, it isnt easy. Mind if I ask what bodie of water you where fishing?? I have nevr got a sauger and am interested in geting one.   Darren"
661682,Rod Caster,2012-01-29 15:02:00,5784,That's a REAL nice Sauger Mike. I have never seen on over 14inches. They are typically smaller than walleye... So I guess that's a testament to how good your walleye fishery is!  Great fish!
661687,mike rousseau,2012-01-29 15:15:00,4661, I thought so...  I don't know much about sauger cause we don't have many around here...  I've caught thousands of walleye and this is my first sauger  So at 19 inches this might be a PB that I won't likely beat...
661691,Rod Caster,2012-01-29 15:22:00,5784," I've caught several in the Ottawa river near Mattawa, but nothing near that size. Nice markings on it, eh? Btw, don't stick you fingers in their mouths they clamp down like Pike and don't let go! Much stronger jaw than a walleye"
661693,Skipper D,2012-01-29 15:26:00,1970,  I was telling Roger last night on the phone you guys were out there yesterday and he could'nt beleive it .. lol .
661697,BillM,2012-01-29 15:39:00,17367, Lots of sauger in the Ottawa river.
661706,Leecher,2012-01-29 16:13:00,7832,"Mike, saugers are definitely smaller then their cousin the yellow pickeral... my PB was a 16 3/4""... They are plentiful up here in the Ottawa and Gatineau rivers  Nice haul you got into btw   Congrats on your PB Leechman"
661795,superdad,2012-01-29 23:24:00,353,Musky Mike  You said there was a chance on the Larry to get out and you did - Great job and good fishing report.  David  aka  Superdad
661797,Bob Devine,2012-01-29 23:27:00,251,"Your sauger is a decent one. The Ont record was caught by Kris Gagnier on the Detroit River in 1992, it was 22.20"" and weighed 4.40lbs. It is one of 4 ONT record fish that have been caught in the Windsor area. White crappie, black crappie, temperate hybrid bass(whiper)."
661799,mike rousseau,2012-01-29 23:30:00,4661,  Thanks for the inspiration superdad...  And after figuring out the pattern... Did it ever help me understand winter walleye migrations...  This single day of fishing I probably learnt more important things then any other day this year... To apply to ice fishing that is...  It would have been amazing of we landed the musky tho
661851,Handlebarz,2012-01-30 02:32:00,3790,Nice to see ya getting out there Mike I sure wish I had the time right now if I did there is a lot of open water here for us to play with. Congrats on the new PB and from a boat at the end of Jan your not likely to top it in the near future.
662009,mercman,2012-01-30 18:56:00,7054,"hey Mike....I was reading on the quebec MNR site, and Sauger are sposed to be extinct in your area from Cornwall to Montreal since 1968.Maybe give them a call .      "
662087,mike rousseau,2012-01-30 22:39:00,4661,You would think they would have a closed season for sauger then...  Considering they are thought of as extinct...
