You will see a box containing the code needed to embed a video here. copy the code. post it into your thread. Now be sure you are using the full thread editor, the little button below.... After that you will see a little button on the bottom left, with a + and ""click to configure post options"" click the +. Beside post options you will see HTML Off by default. Change this to HTML ON - auto line break. then finish you're post by clicking reply as normal. You have now embedded video into your post.'"
