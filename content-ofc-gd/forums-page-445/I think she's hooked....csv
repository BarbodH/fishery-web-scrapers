After her first ever ice trip last weekend, and first 3 subsequent fish, I didn't really have a choice about taking her out again this weekend.  So off we go to my one of my most frequented spots on the mighty Nip, to find cold temps and blazin' winds.  Good thing it was a short trip.  The smile says it all...     She pulled out two of these beauties in short order while I was having a hard time scraping up perch and some mightily small walleye.  And at long last, not 5 minutes before dusk, I coax a large walleye right to my hole, only to have the treble catch on the ice shelf and watch him swim back to the deeps.  Revenge was in my grasp, but I fell short.  Not that I mind...   Embedding photots doesn't seem to work? My link  http://imageshack.us.../dscf1011qn.jpg"
