660675,barrystrs,2012-01-26 18:03:00,75,"I flew over the lake wednesday.  The West side has a large open hole just south of Goreski's and several small open spots just to the north.  The tip of the Island has 3 large open spots so it is almost half water.  Between Washburn and Ceasarea there are 2 large open spots and some smaller ones.  Still an open spot south of Cesarea also.  Many of the normal lines and cracks in the ice have open spots about the size of a 4 wheeler along them.  There is one hut half sunk in front of View lake. IMO,,, It is ok to go out, just don't wander around, especially after dark.  There was one vehicle, a full size black ford pickup on the ice in front of Goreski's."
660685,irishfield,2012-01-26 18:24:00,26272, Remember what everyone said about Heavy Sinc??  Barry... what are you flying?
660969,barrystrs,2012-01-27 05:16:00,75,"The sunken hut is metal, with a chocolate brown roof.  I'm flying a Rans S6 ultralight."

661361,spooner_jr,2012-01-28 13:07:00,193,"That open area south of Goreski's and east of Westshore marina is about twice the size it was on Thursday.  I did see a set of tire tracks from a truck yesterday, probably the same black Ford out again, but no way is it safe to be driving a vehicle out there."
662040,fish-miester,2012-01-30 20:54:00,864,"Was out last night, have a tin hut out by Birch island lots of ice under me, sinclair where abouts is your hut located ??  I also saw a hut 5o% in the drink but its just south of view lake right off of st.christophers not far from shore at all."
