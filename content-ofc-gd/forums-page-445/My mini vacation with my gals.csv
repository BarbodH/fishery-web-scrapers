I pondered on where to go and thought to myself, as well asked my girls if they wanted to go on a road trip. A definite yes was hailed out of their mouths  . Well, I thought for a while where I have  not fished before. hmmmmm,,,,,,,, QUEBEC  So thats where we ended up alright  .  The trip up was a little hairy on the 401 on the way up, every where i looked there was a truck or a vehicle in the ditch wether it was east or west bound around the napene area, west bound was practicly shut down. We plowed through with only one close call, thank god.  We finally made it to the hotel room and I pmed our good friend leechman, shortly after cleaning out my truck doesnt he pop by for a visit  The next morning bright and early we were off on our way, yes there was a 1/2 delay that was my fault by all means  .  Sorry Jacques, please forgive me for that  anyhow, we were off to a local lake, the sun was shinning and there was fresh snow on the lake. We were greated by a friendly dog in which my girls were occupied with for most of the day  Paul had punched holes all over and we had all the best of the best out to attract these fish, nothing came by to tug our lines at all. Ohh well it happens from time to time.  All in all, we had a blast fishing, a little sight seeing was wonderfull, the scenery was fantastic.  Thank you my friend, we have enjoyed our time in quebec, that will not be forgotten.  Oh yes before I forget, another one of leechmans creations was gifted to me and now I need to learn how to ply the game   Last night I noticed he etched my name in it  On to the pics  "
