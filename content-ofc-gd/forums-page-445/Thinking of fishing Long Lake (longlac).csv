I'm now looking for a long weekend adventure.  I've always wanted to fish Long Lake (or longlac) as people call it just off of highway 11 past Hearst. I was just wondering if anyone had fished it or not? Realisticly I'm probabally going regardless of what I hear, its just odd that after looking online I found zero reviews or info about it.  "

662333,adempsey,2012-01-31 23:22:00,1498,Was curious about that lake myself.  Couldn't find out much about it either.  Was looking at a few of the lodges located on it recently.
662338,solopaddler,2012-01-31 23:32:00,8605,Longlac is very much an unknown commodity.  The south end of the lake looks interesting. A new lodge was opened there fairly recently and in fact a report was posted from it last year by one of our members:  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=54835&st=0&p=597085&hl=northern%20woods%20lodge&fromsearch=1entry597085

662383,the spirit of fishing,2012-02-01 02:08:00,141,I spent a few days there about 11 years ago when I decided to drive around Ontario for a solo vacation. If the driving didn't eat up so much time I'd have been back. Caught good numbers of eating size fish right at Longlac.
