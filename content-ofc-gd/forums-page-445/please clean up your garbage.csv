The ice is getting really unstable and we are loosing it fast. torrmow it will be unsafe. I was very frustrated when i got there and the pictures will show you why.    this one is crazy.    i saw that someone wanted a pic of the killer hill so here it is with some pics of the unsafe ice:     and here is a pic of one from last week, which went back down the hole:       tightlines and stay safe"
662629,Bluegill,2012-02-01 23:30:00,197, Tnx very much for your post! We have really nice fishing spots - but too often we have to clean the spots before can start fishing. There were places where we took out 2 large black garbage bags!

662664,Fisherman,2012-02-02 01:14:00,7201," Oh, Amen on that one, big time!  It's called laziness."
662672,bigredfisher,2012-02-02 01:32:00,300,Especially when u see the garbage is full. Take it home
662694,Rizzo,2012-02-02 01:59:00,4754,"ya I drove by there yesterday and saw all that junk. I'd say the same, good on people for at least bringing it back to the garbage can, but when you see its full take it home!"
