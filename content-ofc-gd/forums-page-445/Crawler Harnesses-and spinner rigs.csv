I really enjoyed making those.  I've wanted to get into the harnesses but time is the issue.  After this tread I think I have to make some time!!

My question is how do you store these crawler harnesses after  they come out of the package. I hate a tangle mess.

661340,Dabluz,2012-01-28 07:28:00,701,"  Yes...that is a fast snell knot but I couldn't trust such a knot.  I use 2 other methods for snelling hooks.  One is like a uni-knot and the other is a new one that I have yet to test for strength.  I use eyeless hooks a lot.  I get them from Europe and they are simply fantastic.  I may use a small tube to make a real snell knot but finding a tube small enough may be a problem.  I have a hypodermic needle that would be perfect for line under 6 lb test.  I could use a small nail like when I make a nail knot on a fly line but on a tiny hook, it would take too long to tie....too easy to mess up the knot."

I use to use 12 lb mono line but now with all the zebra mussel areas I drag them on, I had to move up to 20 lb fluorocarbon. I find 2 razor sharp Gamakatsu Octopus Hooks do the job nicely....expensive little devils but sticky sharp.  Most all other colors work too but making them all pretty and nice looking catch more fishermen then fish...."
658295,adempsey,2012-01-20 00:48:00,1498,"I've been making my harnesses for a couple of seasons now.   I fish inland lakes for walleye with them, but only use them about 25% of the time.  Typically I troll them attached to bottom bouncers or weighted with split shot, but have also drifted with them weighted with a slip sinker or split shot.  I use 17lb to 20lb mono.  Usually Trilene Big Game.  I have used fluorocarbon as well, but if I were to make more I would use mono.  Lengths run from 18"" to 6'.  I use octopus hooks.  Sizes 4 and 2.  I prefer Owner hooks, but also like the Mustad wide-gap bait hooks.  I am currently trying out some Matzuo sickle hooks.  I've also used BPS XPS hooks and found them to be inferior.  I make harnesses with both single and double hooks.  The double hooks I sometimes use one size 4 and one size 2 hook.  I use #4 Colorado blades.  Most are in nickel or gold finish (polished and hammered), but use all sorts of blades - depends on what I can get on sale or find in a bargain bin.  I attach the blade using a folded clevice - size 1 I think.   I don't use the quick change clevices because I am more likely to switch the entire harness than a single blade - and they cost a lot more.  I use 4mm, 6mm and 8mm beads.  Mostly plastic faceted beads from the dollar or craft store.  I've also made a few ""bodies"" out of plastic air tubing.  To assemble I use a snell knot to attach the hooks (usually the standard method but sometimes I use one of the quick snell knot methods) and often put on a small 4mm bead first.  For some reason I find that the smaller bead seems to fit better above the snell knot.   I follow that by 6-8 6mm beads, clevice+blade and a final single 6mm bead.  I sometimes put a single 8mm bead in the centre between the 6 6mm beads.  I use all sorts of colors, but primarily green, red, orange, yellow, chartreuse and pink.  I then tie on a barrel swivel at the end.  I typically use size 10 Mustad diamond-eye or size 7 Rosco swivels.  I've also made some larger sized harnesses with 1/0 hooks, #5 Colorado blades and 8mm beads.  Here are a couple of harnesses, nothing special really.       This one has one of the home-made lure bodies on it.     I made a few spoon harnesses as well but have yet to try them out.    I have made a boatload of them and have way more than I will ever use, but enjoy assembling them.   I probably have far more beads than a grown man should ever own......"
658381,Dabluz,2012-01-20 04:18:00,701," I snipped away a bit of your posting but left the spoon harness.  Spoon harnesses are extremely popular for brook trout in my region (Saguenay, P.Q.).  However, the best results come when there is more distance between the spoon and the baits.  As I said before, almost all of my harnesses are made with heavy mono of 14 to 20 lb test and then I add a longer leader of smaller mono for the snelled hooks.  I like about 20 to 24 inches of light leader material in front of the 2 or 3 snelled hooks.  The walleye and especially the brook trout hit the bait hard.  The blades and beads or the spoon does attract fish from further away but when the fish are about to bite, many are shy and that's why the often only nip at the last hook.  There is always the fact that the lighter leader material behind the blades or spoons will break when snagged on bottom and if there is any loss, it's only the hooks that are lost."
658384,adempsey,2012-01-20 04:47:00,1498," Yes, I read your previous post and it sounds like a good approach.   The only reason I am using heavy test line is for the added stiffness for the spinner anyway.  I will tie some up using your approach.  I do like the idea of having the spoon or spinner further up the line."

I tend to favour two coloured blades (with stripe) I believe the dual colours give a better presentation as they spin in the water. The single colours look like one solid colour as they spin in the water. (meaning you might as well just have a round coloured ball, not taking into account the vibration of the blade) I always use floats inline with beads to help the bait float higher in the water column. Sometimes use propeller floats inline. I have yet to find a hook that has a wide enough gap for my likeing. I often use minnow gulp bait and haver found I miss fish due to the reduced space between bait and hook. I think I will experiment with the hollow rubber baits to help with this as the bait will collapse easily as the fish bites down on it. If a manually increase the gap in my hook I have found my hookup success is almost 100%. I make my rigs with 24 inches of line.  I fish the rigs mostly with a banana style bottom bouncer. Sometimes with an inline triangular weight. I often tip the rig with a 1 cm piece of crawler. This vastly increases hookups as ""short"" bites result in hook bites."

Wow, they look like cat's eyes and when a light shines on them, they glow like a cat's eyes.  They are 6 mm in size.  I do not use fluorocarbon because of weak knot strength.  Instead I use clear mono leader material in about 14 lb test.  I guess even 20 lb test would do just as well.  I tie a good swivel above and below the beads and blades then I add my 2 or 3 snelled hooks using 10 or 12 lb clear mono.  I tie the snelled hooks to the bottom swivel.  I vary the distance between the blades and the snelled hooks (6 to 20 inches).  I found that walleye seem to prefer it this way or maybe the walleye I fish are more skittish.  Anyway, I fish log infested waters and the depth varies greatly in the river where I do most of my fishing.  If I do get snagged, I only lose the hooks.
