661939,quickme,2012-01-30 15:18:00,261,"Hi Everyone,   I'm looking for some good recommendations for hut rentals for Simcoe.   I know i've read in the past that Dave's Fish huts are pretty good but i'm looking to hear some feedback from this year.  We're just looking for some jumbo's and maybe the odd pike or anything that will tug the line.   We've been to Scugog a couple times this year but 3 inch dinks is not something I would report back.  I did manage to hook onto a pretty big muskie but that was lost pretty fast on 4lb line.  ( its true and not a ""fisherman's"" tale   )  If you have any other sugguestions i would be happy to hear them.  I'm not very familar with that part of simcoe so I'd rather be safe.  I'm looking to book on Feb. 11th.  Thank you in advance.   Nick"

661981,uglyfish,2012-01-30 17:43:00,981,"I was out with terry goy yesterday, had a great time with a ton of fish. But no jumbos, or anythin really worth keeping. Some story from many others, lots but no real size."
661983,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-30 17:47:00,2690,"Another good one, right beside Dave's...Ice Fishing Outfitters, Mike Heyink.  Good service, decent fishing."
661988,adempsey,2012-01-30 17:56:00,1498,"Check here: http://www.timeonthewater.ca/simcoe_icehuts.html  and here: http://www.ontariooutofdoors.com/icefishing/articles/?ID=327&a=read  Terry Goy, Tim Hales, Floyd Hales, Love to Fish Simcoe, Casey's are all popular.  I don't think there is a specific spot for jumbos (at least, that I know of...wish I did!), but people have been catching them off Gilford and Port Bolster.   The guys at 2nd Line Innisfil just put huts out recently as well.  Not sure what's going on in Beaverton, don't usually fish that side.  Good ice reports of the Gilford area here: http://www.youtube.com/user/THEBLUEICEREPORT"
662000,quickme,2012-01-30 18:42:00,261,thanks for everyone's input!  I know its up to me to catch the fish but as long as they put me close to the action thats all i can really ask for.   Thanks FishLogic for the links.  I may just check out Gilford.  Keep 'em coming if you guys have any more sugguestions.  Nick
662001,misfish,2012-01-30 18:46:00,29133, Watch yourself. Dont want to go in.  I second the Goy service. Great people.
662006,quickme,2012-01-30 18:54:00,261,"  too many horror stories of ""un-educated"" fishermen not knowing the waters and ice thickness this year.    I would pay not to be a story or statistic.  Thanks for the advice thou.  Man I really need to get out!!!!!!!"
662016,misfish,2012-01-30 19:20:00,29133, Not only the fisherman. Guess you missed the nightly news.        
662046,quickme,2012-01-30 21:03:00,261, i didn't see this on the news!!  hhhmmm   i guess tomorrow's weather is not going to make the lake any better.  Mother Nature has to decide if it's hardwater season or softwater season.  is that a house boat?
662085,misfish,2012-01-30 22:34:00,29133, Looks like a broken down shed to me.
662175,Sinker,2012-01-31 07:16:00,8692,"If you want perch that are big enough to keep, check the operators from virginia beach east to beaverton. The west shore is mostly dinks. Sure, you'll catch lots, but I'd prefer to catch less, more quality.  S."
