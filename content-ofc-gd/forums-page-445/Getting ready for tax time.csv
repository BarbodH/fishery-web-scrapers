I bought my house in March of 2011. We totally gutted and renovated everything. Is there any thing I should be claiming for tax time ???? Just trying to get as much of my $$ back as possible. I have put a call into my accountant but I just was curious if anyone has gone through this and what they found was the best approach  Thanks for any input"

They then based our 'rebate' on the improvement we created in the houses overall energy efficiency. They also took into account new windows, insulation etc. There may be specific rebates for upgrading you furnace and electronic thermostat etc. Check the Ministry of Environment for information on rebate programs."

662336,camillj,2012-01-31 23:30:00,1988,well .. .if you moved 40Km closer to work (or your new work location if you switched offices) you can claim the moving costs ( and real estate fees etc).

As for your renovations do you make income off your property? Ie rent part of it out or operate a home business?. If you do there is a potential to reduce your tax burden on the income you earned from those kinds of things from the renovations.
662454,Beans,2012-02-01 14:52:00,3339,If you have to travel more than 40kms (one-way) for medical treatment you can claim $0.57 per km for the total kms travelled...  If you travel more than 80 kms (one-way) for medical treatment you can claim $0.57 per km for the total kms travelled and you can also claim $17 per meal...if someone had to drive you to the appointment (operation- you would not be allowed to drive for 24 hrs) you also can claim the meal allowance for them...  There are two ways you can claim these...one with receipts and the other without receipts...  Like all medical claims you only get the tax back on the total amount not the total...

662597,Joey,2012-02-01 21:46:00,9122,Just buy a Turbo Tax disc and follow the instructions.  There comes a time when it asks about buying a home/renovations etc.
