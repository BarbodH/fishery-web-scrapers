You will all recognize the style, as it as similar to the Gold Series Royalty/Regal reels that were so popular, hence the name R2. This reel will be on the Imperial chasis, as it has proven itself to be a workhorse, and carries the same dimensions. Weight of the spool will be slightly less, but no figures available. The reel will be available in a few weeks, and in all the colours. Pricing has been set to $525, because of increased machining costs over the Imperial.  "

662008,ironstone74,2012-01-30 18:54:00,201,The large holes were added to this model after feedback from Steelheaders that like to use their finger to spin the spool when retrieving.  More details to follow!  Paul
