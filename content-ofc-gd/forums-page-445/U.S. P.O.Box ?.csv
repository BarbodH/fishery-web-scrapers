662002,msp,2012-01-30 18:49:00,1336,Does anybody have a U.S. post office box that I could ship U.S. bought lures to. The supplier that Im dealing with will only ship to the U.S. Im wondering if there is a way around this. Any suggestions?

662054,bdox,2012-01-30 21:12:00,329,"Have it shipped to the UPS store in Lewiston, NY. They will hold it for you for a small fee until you pick it up. How you get it back across the border is up to you. Some remove all packaging and put everything in a plano/tackle box. I recommend declaring everything and paying the duty/taxes if applicable."

662093,mike rousseau,2012-01-30 23:15:00,4661,I use a shipping/recieving store...  Some companies won't ship to a po box...
662108,aplumma,2012-01-31 00:08:00,6896, I learned my lesson the hard way. I once offered to forward a package for someone who was a casual friend up North. For some reason he never got his Switchblade knife he ordered.  :wallbash:    Art
662130,msp,2012-01-31 01:30:00,1336,"  Uh Oh, your on to me !  Thanks for the replies guys. Im all set up now ."
662147,Dutch,2012-01-31 03:02:00,831," +1 for CBI.  I've used them 3 times now with NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.  Very easy, they take all sizes and weights.  Also they have a physical address and no PO box worries.  They are known by USPS, UPS and Fed Ex. and get multiple deliveries from each everyday."
662543,frozen-fire,2012-02-01 19:03:00,542, This.  I've been using CBI for years now with zero issues.
662547,10point,2012-02-01 19:12:00,165,You can ship all the lures you want to my house  Seriously though if you are from around London Ontario where my in-laws live I might be able to help you out sometime.
