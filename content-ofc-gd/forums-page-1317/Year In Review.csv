Perchin in Orillia, not many caught this day. Met up with Pikie and crew at the launch ramp at the end of the day.   No pics or fish but got a day on Lake O in May Salmon hunting.  Fathersday weekend on the south shore of nippising.   July on the south shore of Nipp. at the begining of the week.   Biggest blue I ever saw, caught by my 7 year old daughter   Last feast of the week on south shore.   Camped at Dairymple Labourday weekend, got wet, no fish!   Missed opportunities for the year,  West Arm Nip. in mid September and Kempenfelt Perchin Thanksgivingweekend.  Last chance, Niagara, before Christmas!!  Perry"
