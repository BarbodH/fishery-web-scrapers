I had my crappie gear with me and from what I've been reading the whitefish like the small stuff too. I tried small hooks with a single salmon egg, swedish pimples, 1/16 jig and minnow and flies of bottom and drifted in the current a few times all day without a sniff of action. I was told they won't feed while spawning.  Does anyone fish for whitefish ? when there spawning ? How do you get them to bite ?  It would be good because theres no boats ever around and I don't think anyone knows about them being there, or maybe other people have tried and failed as well."
