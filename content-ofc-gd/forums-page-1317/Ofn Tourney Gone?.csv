I didn't have a copy on my computer (yes that was dumb) and I had split the info over two servers thinking it would be safer that way. Turns out it wasn't. I'll be done all of this stuff in a day or two so we can fix up the stats. With this new board, next year the captains will do their own stats. Big plus for everyone. Not having to wait for me is likely the best part of that."
