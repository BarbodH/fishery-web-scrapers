1861,nelly,2006-11-18 18:57:00,256,"I fish the Kawartha's only in the spring and fall. Fishing for walleye on stoney this year was tough. Only a few and they were mainly small. Largest was maybe 3.5 lbs and a mink got a piece of it while it was on the stringer. Did find a few crappies in about 15-20 feet of water. Struggling to find walleye on stoney, I left to the tri-lakes and hunted for crappie for the first time and hit a big school after a l-o-n-g search. Not many slabs but on the good days, I manage to land 100+ but kept less than 20. During the late fall, I return to rice and still struggle on the walleye but my friends did well. They say it was one of the best years. I did see lots of walleye and they were mix bag from 2 lbs to 10 lbs. Few weeks ago, there were two guys who said that they caught over 40+ walleye (avg 2lbs) between the two of them during the whole day. Now I don't know if this was true or just another fish story?"
1187,ccmtcanada,2006-11-17 15:01:00,7971,"Just wondering how the Kawartha's were this past fishing season.  The season ended either on Sept 30 or Nov 15, depending on what you were fishing for.  Any personal bests this year from the area?"
1192,b2kptbo,2006-11-17 15:05:00,1505,"Lots of action, but no monsters..."
1207,nautifish,2006-11-17 15:37:00,1416,I was up there in June this past summer camping and fishing. Stayed at serpant mounds and took the boat up.....Had an awesome time and some great fishing.  Only complaint i had was too much bloody weed and was not they're for  long enough....  I lurv the karwarthas.....
1212,kemper,2006-11-17 15:41:00,2232,"Tons of fish(bass), but mostly in the 1-2 pound range. A few walleye thrown in for surprise. Id say an average year.  Scugog on the other hand.....well I just cant figure that damn lake out!"
1216,musky66,2006-11-17 15:46:00,273,"Got my first and therefore personal bests for Tiger Musky and Pike in a Kawartha Lake, but overall I thought the fishing was a little less productive than last year. Last year was exceptional for me though so maybe my expectations were just to high?"
1223,Rich,2006-11-17 15:53:00,3927,"Well I caught my PB musky there this year, but all in all the fishing was normal. This was the first year that I wasnt able to score any really big bass from the kawarthas.. of course once I got that musky, I didnt feel much like bass fishing."
1226,Beans,2006-11-17 15:56:00,3339,Landed my first Pigeon Lake musky this year...have had a few break/cut me off before while fishing for bull bluegills with an ulra-lite outfit but this one was hooked in the upper lip away from the teeth...  Also landed a 25 lb (Approx) carp near the end of July...
1227,Kawartha Kev,2006-11-17 15:57:00,281,Hey musky66  If you don't mind saying which Kawartha lake did you get a pike in? I am dreading the time when they get well established as it will kill the musky fishery which I really enjoy. No monster muskies this year for me but lots of hook-ups and many fish in the 35 to 40 inch range for me on Lower Buckhorn  Kawartha Kev
1228,ehg,2006-11-17 16:00:00,2666,"Didn't fish as much as usual this year, but found the weedbeds on Pigeon deteriorated and choked with green slimy stuff. Found the fish harder to locate as a result.  ehg"
1235,paulfarr,2006-11-17 16:11:00,3,"Early season bassin (largemouth) was great on Rice, numbers up but size down.  Sept smallmouth was good but the topwater action was below par compared to what I have been used to (a lot of algea bloom).  Walleye seemed to be more productive than other years, a lot of  11""-13"" fish that should be 2 pounders by next year.  All in all a pretty good year on Rice.  Needtofish"
1250,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-17 16:26:00,0,Had some good days and some slow days.  Overall average I guess. No PB's
1261,fishdawg,2006-11-17 16:37:00,912,only made it up 3 times    but did ok  each time     learned a few new things/spots as well - did suprisingly well on eyes too - only 2 muskie though
1268,BabyHerc,2006-11-17 16:46:00,285,"Ok, I should be banned from OFC, cuz I didn't fish a single Kawartha Lake this year...  I've lost all respect for myself."
1281,setomonkey,2006-11-17 17:02:00,872,"Didn't fish much in the Kawarthas, except for the family cottage lake. I've always found the fishing slow there, so I suppose it was an ""average"" year, but I had a few good days for numbers (not size).  Mike"
1303,Jigatollah,2006-11-17 17:31:00,53,I found the bass fishing to be excellent this year in the Kawartha's. I had my 1st PB and upgraded twice to a final largemouth that was close to 9lbs.  I 've seen  a lot more bigger bass this year as well compared to the previous years.
1317,robin,2006-11-17 17:42:00,46,We found the sizes were really down this year for the Skis Robin
1589,Rizzo,2006-11-18 00:48:00,4754,fished Kawarthas for the first time this year.  Found the action pretty reliable and the fish skinny
1595,PatB,2006-11-18 00:56:00,104,"Did really well on the walleye up there this year, nothing big, but all good eating size, for the muskie only fished 3 time this year, couple of follows that was about it. Just a busy year not that much fishing going on this year. hopefully next year will give me more time. Yea right."
1603,Dutch,2006-11-18 01:07:00,831,"Caught a PB Muskie myself, nothing huge, but still a PB as it was my first.  Bass - average to a little above.  Lots of fish with a 3-4 pounder thrown in here and there.  Crappie - slow year, not sure why.  Maybe not out early enough in the spring.  Perch - way above average.  Walleye - below average.  WGSF - well above average.  Pike - non existent in Kawartha Lakes still (I hope).  I too want to hear about what lake the Tiger Muskie and Pike were caught in.  Looking forward to next year!"
1627,Ron,2006-11-18 02:28:00,1683,"Fishing the Kawarthas for me was well above average, This being the first year ""on my own"" targeting Muskie. I boated 22 with the largest being a nice fat 46""."
1639,jediangler,2006-11-18 03:02:00,1923,"I spent about 24 hours fishing for musky on Sturgeon and Pigeon and ended up with 9 musky between 25"" - 40"". I also got 4 skis in two hours in the kayak on Bass opener."
1684,cisco,2006-11-18 04:47:00,597,"I fish Stoney for eyes and got up there later than usual during mid summer.  Hadto scratch for walleyes. Bigger than usual, but fewer in number. Only the last three weeks of season I nailed em and got limits all 3 trips. Nothing huge, but good eaters, which was my goal."
1687,mattyk,2006-11-18 04:52:00,2110,"Caught muskies on two of the kawartha lakes that i have never fished before. Looking forward to next year. I had a really tough time on scugog for muskies, last year i did a lot better. For my 5 or six tries only managed to get one muskies. Thats really strange."
1792,Jer,2006-11-18 15:59:00,1426,"I fish Upper Buckhorn a lot...and have been for the past 11 seasons.  Overall, I have to say it was my poorest year yet...you think I would have learned something by now.  The crappie in spring wasn't bad, though found a lot more traffic on our spots.  Only a couple of pickerel once the season opened and not even a hint of a musky from opener til bass opened.  The bass fishing was good through July but I couldn't find one bigger than 3.5 lbs or so. After the weather changed in early August and the top-water bite went south, I was at a loss to find anything over a pound and a half.  The fall brought some more musky fishing and nothing but a few misses and follows...never a hook-up.  Late fall usually finds us dangling some minnows under a float from the dock where we've managed in the past some pretty good perch fries and even the occasional evening pickerel. This year only a few dink perch and not a sniff of an eye.  My season on the Kawarthas in a nutshell. A solid vote for below normal."
1813,Matt15,2006-11-18 16:28:00,107,Lots of bass and finally caught some walleye out of the karwarthas. Overall it was a pretty good season.
