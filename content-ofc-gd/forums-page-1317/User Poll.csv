793,IanD,2006-11-17 00:28:00,16,I voted for a Spell Checker cause I type like a chimp wearing mittens.
794,bigfish1965,2006-11-17 00:30:00,3382,We now have spell check
802,Rattletrap2,2006-11-17 00:41:00,1652,"Yup, Spell check to start with! Thanks"

1065,Fish Farmer,2006-11-17 11:21:00,2234,"I think Joey mention, a Delete thread botton. Unless you can edit your thread out"
1279,BabyHerc,2006-11-17 16:58:00,285,I would like the Flogs and the email address.
1356,kemper,2006-11-17 18:42:00,2232,I think an OFC email would be cool.  Help keep my regular email and my important (fishing related) email seperated
1360,bigfish1965,2006-11-17 18:50:00,3382,Only mods can delete threads. We had a few people abusing the 'delete your own post' option and it kinda created havoc.
376,bigfish1965,2006-11-16 16:38:00,3382,We will add some fun stuff a bit at a time. Just looking for input.
381,Joey,2006-11-16 16:40:00,9122,Only one choice?  I'd like a couple of those.  Joey
385,bigfish1965,2006-11-16 16:43:00,3382,One at a time Joey. Can't put too much in at once or that hubby of yours will get all confused.
386,Chuck Best,2006-11-16 16:44:00,308,"Yeah, what Joey said.......There's a couple of good ones there......."
389,setomonkey,2006-11-16 16:45:00,872,"Voted for a ""flog"", though I barely have time to keep up with threads, much less post stories etc. Would be fun to keep track of my reports in one place though, and to be able to share that link with friends and fellow OFNers.  Mike"
393,dustink,2006-11-16 16:51:00,526,Flogs would be fun to read...but the reports we all post could satisfy that that....wait...can I change my vote to....Weather would probably be most useful.  And who neds spel chek??

404,ccmtcanada,2006-11-16 16:59:00,7971,I'd love to see a member map....be nice to know who was close by for hook-ups!!
406,bigfish1965,2006-11-16 17:01:00,3382,We have a member map already somewhere..would just need to figure out how to build it in.
414,ccmtcanada,2006-11-16 17:10:00,7971, Really?  Could I have the URL?
417,bigfish1965,2006-11-16 17:11:00,3382,"I can't remember it, but one of the other guys may have it."
420,ccmtcanada,2006-11-16 17:20:00,7971,Decided to hit a popular mapping site and I found it.....  http://www.frappr.com/ontariofishingnetwork/map  Thanks for the info! Cliff

475,mikeh,2006-11-16 18:38:00,824,spell check for starters
482,Beans,2006-11-16 18:51:00,3339,"  It is probably way too late for this but it is a shame that location wasn't made a ""required"" field at the registration level...  Don't you just love it when someone asks how can i get to_______? when they haven't given their location...""You can't get there from nowhere"" and someone said the fishing was great there the past couple of days...Yep, no location...could have been in Florida for all the good that post was !!!"
484,bigfish1965,2006-11-16 18:54:00,3382,"Good idea, but I wouldn't want to force someone to say where they are from. In case they like to post pics of a local spot. Knowing their location may give away a small stream or similar. This way it is optional."
486,Beans,2006-11-16 18:59:00,3339,   Even if they had of used Southern Ontario or Northern Ontario Etc. that way we have some idea of giving directions...  I agree on fishing posts with pictures...keep it vague...
488,robin,2006-11-16 19:04:00,46,Spell Check Please Robin

739,Greencoachdog,2006-11-16 23:40:00,8163,"Yes, spell check... and could we make it mandatory and automatic... for the ones that think they don't need it"
