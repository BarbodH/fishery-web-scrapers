1088,Eddyk,2006-11-17 12:20:00,195,Ive seen dollys for canoes that fit underneath the canoe and you just push the canoe to where you want to go. I checked BPS and they dont stock them. Does anyone know where I can get one.
1093,brickNblock,2006-11-17 12:25:00,598,"Ive not seen them anywhere myself.... There was a time I actually looked for one. Somewhere back in the OFC archives there was a post, ...of a talented person who made one themselves. I dont fully recall, but I believe they started with one of them kids 'ole red wagons."
1095,steve_paul,2006-11-17 12:27:00,658,I think that was JediAngler who rigged up one for his Kayak.
1101,jediangler,2006-11-17 12:37:00,1923,"I built one myself, for my kayak, out of 4 hockey sticks. You could alter the design easily for a canoe.     Add some pool noodle pieces and some bungee cords.    So easy even a five yr old can pull it around.    When you're on the water, the cart goes with you.    Good luck."
1108,verno,2006-11-17 12:44:00,178,You can get them at MEC I think
1135,Nemo,2006-11-17 13:22:00,727,Yep MEC carries them. Just search at www.mec.ca. Also maybe check Lee Valley.
1145,char finder,2006-11-17 13:40:00,12,"Eddyk,  I have one that is a real cadilac!  it was custom built by a professor at Queens university and includes a spare tire and rim, and even a kickstand which will support the canoe in a horizontal position. it was built to qonquer the Dickson lake portage in Algonquin. if you have done that trip before, you will know what i mean about the ultimate dolly!  right now it is in my shed, taking up space. i am planning to do 1 more trip into Dickson this spring with it, but if you need it anytime, let me know. we are close enough that i can meet you in Newcastle or somewhere along the 401.    Charfinder"
1155,Eddyk,2006-11-17 14:06:00,195,Thanks for all the help. I appreciate it. Jedianler; You should patten that . Its a great design and thanks Charfinder for the generous offer. I went on line with MEC and they do stock them but they dont show any of their locations. If anyone knows could you please reply. Thanks again.
1179,verno,2006-11-17 14:52:00,178,The closest one is in TO at king and spadina area
1185,fishindevil,2006-11-17 14:58:00,6254,"ah,very nice jedi, thats pretty neat ive never seen a homemade one thats cool"
1202,Nemo,2006-11-17 15:22:00,727,Charfinder could you post apic of that baby I'd love to see that. My bud is building one this winter and we are looking for ideas.
1214,dustink,2006-11-17 15:41:00,526,Seem expensive to buy (Jedi may have the right idea)....but Cabela's has a couple of different options:    Option #1    Option #2    dk
1233,Fisherman,2006-11-17 16:05:00,7201,Cabela's has a folding lightweight model.
1242,The Urban Fisherman,2006-11-17 16:14:00,2050,"ahhh i've seen this set-up before - good job once again Jedi-Angler...hope you don't mind if I use the plans!  cheers, UF"
1256,Eddyk,2006-11-17 16:35:00,195,Thanks again for the help.
1331,outdoorguy61,2006-11-17 18:01:00,220,"Depending upon where you are, there are a number of places that sell canoe caddys. In Missisauga, there is a canoe store on the QE, fairly close to Europe Bound (I would also not be surprised if they had them). In Peterborough, try Paluski Boats; New Liskeard the canoe company; Algonquin Park- Swift Canoe; Frontenac Park- Frontenac Outfitters.  I used one a number of years ago (30 pds +) and we actually took in a canoe 14 miles into Fortress Lk/BC (large brookies). It was not too bad, other than a few uphill slogs.  outdoorguy61"
1369,char finder,2006-11-17 18:59:00,12,Here is a quick pic of mine.  it is not foldable but i had the person who made it reinforce the model by putting a stringer in between the axles. the spare sits on top of this. it has been many tough trails with no damage.
1374,Eddyk,2006-11-17 19:08:00,195,Thanks again
1381,Nemo,2006-11-17 19:11:00,727,Thanks Charfinder that's a nice one.
1475,watertight,2006-11-17 20:55:00,50,We used one homemade with bicycle wheels.The bigger diameter wheels workwed great in the bush. 
1484,Ron,2006-11-17 21:05:00,1683,"Eddyk,  I You know this guy who lives about 7 kms from you, If you ask me him, I he might lend it to you when you need one. I'll he'll take a pic of it."
1490,Ron,2006-11-17 21:25:00,1683,    
1517,jediangler,2006-11-17 22:07:00,1923,"I have seen many made of PVC pipe, but I hear that they don't stand up to heavy bush use. I have changed to larger wheels on mine, but I'm still looking to put some bike wheels on it eventually. Total cost (minus the hockey sticks) was around $12. Be creative over the winter and build your own."
