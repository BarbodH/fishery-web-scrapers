1290,setomonkey,2006-11-17 17:14:00,872,"I heard there was a river & stream advisory this morning, and saw pictures of the Don really high (not that you would be fishing the Don!) so I would think they are all blown out, and not safe to fish for a few days.  Mike"

1616,boatman,2006-11-18 01:56:00,350,We had a steady rainfall event yesterday and overnight which raised water levels in all eastern tribs to near high water conditions. Water level for all the eastern tribs were medium to medium high water as of this morning and falling. The 40mm of rain forecasted for today in the Peterborough-Belleville area never materialized. Don't expect more rain until sometime next week.
