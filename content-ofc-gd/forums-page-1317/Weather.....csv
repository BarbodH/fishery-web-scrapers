874,bigfish1965,2006-11-17 02:26:00,3382,Joe...look up...beside the calendar link.
877,Raf,2006-11-17 02:28:00,3495,"dont forget, you have the default skin to worry about."
878,joefish,2006-11-17 02:28:00,165,"Dopie me,thanks Rick...Just got the chance to look around but missed that...Thanks for the great work!!"
881,bigfish1965,2006-11-17 02:31:00,3382,Not for long Raf...
883,Raf,2006-11-17 02:32:00,3495,d'oh. but I like it.  much less clutter and simpler.
886,fishindevil,2006-11-17 02:33:00,6254,"hey rick i was wondering why not just put the weathernetwork there its the most common one ,and covers just about everywhere??????"
888,Fisherman,2006-11-17 02:35:00,7201,"Well it's a try, but, could not find one town/village/landmark even remotely close to Lk Simcoe...then I see Bagotville, mon dieu, maudit bleuet de *#@*, my first base 35 years ago. Maybe a direct link to theweathernet.ca and then the respective area you're looking for."
984,DT10Sam,2006-11-17 04:15:00,480,"Just used it Rick, nice touch.  Regards, Sam"
1138,hawkeye,2006-11-17 13:26:00,162,"nice try, but missing a whole lot Barrie Newmarket  didn't expect Keswick or Georgina and wasn't disappointed"
1142,ccmtcanada,2006-11-17 13:31:00,7971,"I dont understand this farenheit thing....LOL.  I got all excited for a minute and thought it was going to be 30C!!!  Should probably look for a more Canadian friendly service....I noticed the selection of towns and cities a bit lacking....I live in the burbs of Toronto, but many will not find weather close to their lakes..."
1144,tonyb,2006-11-17 13:38:00,1637,Yeah the farenheit thing threw me off but it also has celsius next to it  Thanks for the weather feature nice lil extra. Tony
1148,fatdaddy,2006-11-17 13:49:00,19,"Good idea, but this particular program is definitely lacking.  I live 5 minutes from CFB Borden which has a vast array of meteorological equipment, yet it isn't on the list, no colingwood, barrie etc."
1151,BrownTown,2006-11-17 13:58:00,103,cool
