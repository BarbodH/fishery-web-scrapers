It made it real easy when I logged in If I new I wanted to send a buddy a PM his name always stood out from others, sort of like the Mods in Red... Robin"

Look in the list at the bottom of the page to see who is online as well. You can click on Last Viewed to see exactly where that person was. The name was red on the old site only cause you had viewed that persons profile recently and the links you had clicked on during that session were all red. I will be making a few CSS adjustments...I'm not happy with the current a:link colors, so I will likely switch the a:visited color as well. Maybe a burgundy for links and a reddy purple for visited."
