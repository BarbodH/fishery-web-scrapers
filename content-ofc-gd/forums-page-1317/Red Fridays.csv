Im not able to upload a few pics of my outdoor advertising sign on hwy #17 that I  have tried to drum up support for our troops, west of Sturgeon falls..   Go to     www.redfridays.ca      (I have pics of my sign there) enter the message forum and view the post ""what others are doing"".. Im soo proud of my honey bunny!!  cheers, sturgman    JER, if you have recieved my pm and your not a dumbass like me  could you share the pics I pm'd you?"
1706,JFR,2006-11-18 10:06:00,498,"Who the H##L was the person who checked the ""NO"" box. Please expand on your answer.  This not a question of whether you support the war or don't support the war.  Our soldiers are members of our community, their children and spouses go to the same sporting events, shopping venues as we do.  Sturgman, there were no photos attached to the PM, just a link to the site."
1717,Fisherman,2006-11-18 11:30:00,7201," Seems to me the question was  ""Do you wear red on Fridays"",  and whoever responded said ""no"". So what's the big deal?"
1721,ChrisK,2006-11-18 12:15:00,2772,"Lets just keep in mind that individuals here are not required to give a reason for ones vote on a pole ...  I personally don't have a stitch of red clothing in my cabinet but I do support our troops, red just isn't my colour of choice when it comes to clothing..."
1735,joefish,2006-11-18 13:14:00,165,"Unfortunately I cannot stray from my uniform or I will be sent home for not conforming or I would, Sturgman..."
1744,crappieperchhunter,2006-11-18 13:31:00,2582,"I checked no because I honestly don't own a single article of red clothing.  Do I support out troops you bet I do. When your great  uncle was named the ""Savior of Ceylon"" by Churchill himself...do a google search  if you wish...you know a thing or two about military pride.  May they all come home safe."
1768,JFR,2006-11-18 15:05:00,498,"  I stand corrected, I did not read the question properly"
