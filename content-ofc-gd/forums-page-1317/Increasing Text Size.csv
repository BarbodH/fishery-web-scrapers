1051,lew,2006-11-17 08:53:00,12767,"Hey guys, I find it a little bit harder to read the posts now that the background isn't white anymore, so I was just gonna increase the text size, but for some reason it won't work for me on this board, yet it works fine on other boards.  Would there be something on this new site that would be blocking the text size changes ??   I'm using IE and clicked VIEW / TEXT SIZE / LARGER, but nothing happens."
1052,motv8tr,2006-11-17 08:58:00,2587,"Lew, try holding down your control button, then hitting the plus sign...might make it a little too big though.  Also I think this is only temporary...  Maureen"
1055,lew,2006-11-17 09:08:00,12767,"Thanks Mo, but that didn't work.  Must just be something on this new site that's blocking the change, as it works on other boards.  I'll leave it till one of the wizards gets up."
1060,Roy,2006-11-17 10:51:00,13728,"Lew, if I hold down the CTRL key and turn the wheel on the mouse it changes the text size here."
1075,danbo,2006-11-17 11:54:00,2646,"I use a Marble mouse!  Never mind! I got it! Lol!!  Hold down the Control key then tap on the ""+"" key to adjust it all."
1086,lew,2006-11-17 12:09:00,12767,"Thanks guys, but neither of those tips made any differerence. It's funny though, because on some of the other sites I visit, I can change the text size thru ""view"" and others I can't.  I just find it harder to read the print on this beige background, and actually got a headache from it last night.  Oh well, guess I just won't be posting here as often as usual"
1094,aplumma,2006-11-17 12:26:00,6896,Same issue here Lew IE6 cable with Freedom internet screener. Turned off Freedom still not able to change font. Tried View/text size/larger. Control mouse wheel and Control + no go. I hope their is an answer it is tough to read the small print.  Art
1124,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-17 13:11:00,0,"Lew, you can go to the bottom and switch the background from beige(driftwood)  to white (IPB default).  That might make it a little easier on the eyes."
1137,lew,2006-11-17 13:25:00,12767,"WOW, what a difference !!!!    Thanks Jim, that's absolutely perfect !!  I never knew we could change the skin color like that, but it made all the difference in the world.  Doncha just luv the way we can get help around here  ??"
1146,ketchenany,2006-11-17 13:44:00,3229,"Lew,  that's what I said yesterday, I like my font sizes I play with type for a living"
1173,bigfish1965,2006-11-17 14:39:00,3382,"Lew.. In Internet Explorer, Go to Tools>Internet Options>Accessibility and tick 'Ignore Font Size', this allows you to select the text size with the mouse or the CTRL +/-"
1176,lew,2006-11-17 14:47:00,12767,"Thanks Rick, that solved the problem and my text is much better now"
