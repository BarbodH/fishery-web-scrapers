461,Squid,2006-11-16 18:23:00,1656,Upper or lower woodro? It will most likely be really dirty from all of this rain
478,cantermore,2006-11-16 18:44:00,49,I am hoping to get there next week in the lower so we would love to hear how it goes  Johnny
621,woodro,2006-11-16 21:34:00,168,"squid im heading to the lower in hopes of bumping into a steelie. i dont think the rain effects the river that much due to the size, i could be totally wrong, i'll let you know how i made out tomorrow when i get back"
622,Pigeontroller,2006-11-16 21:39:00,2793,The lower gets dirty too!
627,woodro,2006-11-16 21:43:00,168,"the winds are picking up tonight to 30k's, this could potentially be a bad situation for me in the morning"
973,Rizzo,2006-11-17 04:01:00,4754,"I've never fished the lower, but I've already called off my plans to hit the upper this week-end.  With the wind that is expected the river will be brown above the falls, wouldn't expect much better below."
1049,charlied,2006-11-17 08:00:00,584,"winds aren't that bad right now....3:00AM....in the falls that is...Fort Erie has higher winds right now thou, hope,  they hold off for my morning fish, I am hitting the river too but not from a boat!!"
1842,woodro,2006-11-18 17:48:00,168,"change of plans, my father didnt wake up and info from above posts put doubt in my mind. so went to a favourite trib and landed a bunch of fresh steelies instead.      "
