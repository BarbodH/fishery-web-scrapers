This little puppy produced all the fish - walleye, smallmouth & a bonus Musky.    1/2 oz NuckleBall Zone-R with a 4"" minnow  Part of the results - - -  "

Hangs at Bennet's Bait and Tackle from time to time ... including the local diners.  I think it was a couple years ago, my Dad and step mother had the chance to spend a day with Big Jim and had a fantasic time .. they still talk about it."
