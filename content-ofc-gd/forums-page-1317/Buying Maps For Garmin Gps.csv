1255,fishdawg,2006-11-17 16:34:00,912,I am just wondering if anyone knows of a good source to buy the Blue Charts maps for Garmin - i know CT sells them (and i can get 18% off)   is there anywhere else that would be more reasonable  ( not looking for copies or pirated versions!) thanks

From Gaarmin Support: ( the question was: Can you tell me if all the Canada details features and streep maps are on the City Navigator North America V8 as on the MetroGuide Canada V4 products or would the MetroGuide Canada V4 have more detail?)  Thank you for contacting Garmin.  The differ some.  The data in MetroGuide Canada V4 is from a different vendor (DMTI Spatial).  The North American City Navigator data is from NavTeq.  There will be differences.  For instance (nothing scientific...just things I've seen personally)...the routing tends to be better in Select in some bigger cities (Calgary is one that comes to mind).  But in other areas (say, Jasper) MetroGuide Canada V4 will have some more information.  It will have a bit more in a lot of the more ""off the beaten path"" places and small towns.  The background water info tends to be more thorough in MetroGuide Canada V4, too.  City Navigator has been updated since MetroGuide Canada was…that’s worth saying.  Best way to decide, I think, would be to use the MapSource Map Viewer for each to see the basic detail in them...compare and contrast.  You can get to Viewer links for each from the page about the software:  http://www.garmin.com/cartography/mapSource/citynav.jsp  http://www.garmin.com/cartography/mapSource/mgCanada.jsp  With each, be sure to zoom tightly...click the ""more"" detail button.  The Viewer can be a good tool.  Personally, if I were shopping, I’d go with City Navigator North America v8 on balance…it is on DVD-ROM so make sure on PC compatibility, if you do think about going with it.
