In My Controls, I can only see the threads that I looked at today, not ones that I posted on yesterday, etc.  How do I keep track?  Thanks.  Oops, this should be in the Help Area.  Sorry guys."

Or, before you post your message, click on ""enable email notification"" and you will be emailed whenever someone posts on the same thread."
