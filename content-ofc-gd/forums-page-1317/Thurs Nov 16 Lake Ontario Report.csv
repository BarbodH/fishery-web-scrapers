They said it was supposed to rain tonight and tomorrow, so I figured fishing was out...especially since I shore fish.  Wouldn't you know it...the rain stopped and it was still warm out so I decided I'd head down.  I wasn't hopeful, but it beat sitting at home.  I was out there for almost 3 hours and I was determined not to get skunked, but as time went on, it was looking like that was going to happen.  I had just made the decision to pack it in when a little bullhead attacked my line.  Not much to show for it, but at least I wasn't skunked!!!!  Wish I was heading to BOQ with other OFNers...maybe next year!!!"

1056,Greencoachdog,2006-11-17 09:29:00,8163," Those floatin' devices, are they the inflateable type???  ... remember to take the camera fishin' too!  Great report CC, those Bullheads are some fine eatin' when they come from clean water... but I dunno about the ones from Lake O."
1132,Harrison,2006-11-17 13:20:00,2202,I believe those signs say no fishing....
1159,ccmtcanada,2006-11-17 14:14:00,7971," If you look closely at the colour of the bullhead, I'm pretty sure he's glowing green...must have a home near the nuke plant...."
