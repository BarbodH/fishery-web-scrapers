826765,BillM,2013-12-26 17:31:00,17367,"So no tax, but you can't use your club membership for any further discounts, lol.  So it's basically like every other day in the store for club members?  Sounds like a sale to me!  I wonder how many people will fall for it."
826771,Terry,2013-12-26 18:06:00,14456,There are some specials lol  And it's 13% instead of 10.      Wow
826799,Acountdeleted,2013-12-26 22:28:00,2562,"I went today. Didn't see and deals that stuck out. Bass pro, however, looks like they may have a few good ones."

827162,FrankTheRabbit,2013-12-29 04:30:00,479,"There were some deals to be had. My wife picked up a liner & merino wool sock combo for $10, picked up a pair of Baffin Chloe winter boots for $90 (Amazon sells them for $134), and I picked up a Zippo hand warmer (which doesn't seem to work...).  Aside from the Zippo hand warmer, it wasn't bad. Despite just being a no-tax event, some of their items are priced lower than other retailers."
