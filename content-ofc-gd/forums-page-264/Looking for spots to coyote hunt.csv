827144,NAW,2013-12-29 01:52:00,4022,Should be lots!  Maybe not on OFC.  But if you go banging on doors.  Good chance you'll pick up a few farms.  There's a bounty in some areas over that way right?
827147,tb4me,2013-12-29 02:36:00,3295,not to sure of bounties..Not why we want to hunt them.. its just fun. I suppose a bounty would be an added bonus
827158,Sinker,2013-12-29 03:43:00,8692,Most people will let you if you ask. Have you been to the ganaraska forest? Lots in there too.  S.
827171,Big Cliff,2013-12-29 07:21:00,6899,"Plenty of them around here, we often see them out here on the lake in the winter and there were fresh tracks in our yard last week. Do you use dogs to hunt them?"
827172,fishindevil,2013-12-29 08:53:00,6254,Head up here the kawarthas area lots of farms and most farmers would probly let you hunt them for sure I see them fairly regularly and there is quite a few we hear them howling and last winter watched 2 yotes chase a deer across the lake through binoculars !!!! Cool and I know they would let you coon hunt for sure farmer up the road had shot 10. This year alone he told me !!!!!
827225,Carp,2013-12-29 20:21:00,1488,"Should be lots of places around your area. I remember the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters had a page on their website to help hunters and land owners hook up. Pretty sure they removed the page from their site now, but I do remember a few farmers in the Niagara region looking for hunters to thin out an over population of coyotes.  Check with any farmers that have livestock. Good luck !"
