826843,Cosmos,2013-12-27 12:53:00,588,My best guess is ProTackle in Belleville. Opens at 5 am.
826854,iFish4real,2013-12-27 15:43:00,386,"buy it off the ebay  I got this, works like a charm. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Humminbird-Ice-45-Flasher-Fishfinder-Color-with-Fiber-Optic-Display-407030-1-/350960289954?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item51b6dd08a2  $470+TAX at Cabelas Canada, you're lucky if you find a tackle shop that sells it cheaper"
826930,Sinker,2013-12-27 23:06:00,8692,"Ya, protackle is your best bet. Canadian tire in belleville has a pretty good fishing department, but not sure if they have flashers.  S."
