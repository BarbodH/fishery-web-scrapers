826883,misfish,2013-12-27 19:32:00,29133,"Im not sure if this is a law suit in the making,but if it was mine,GRRRRRRRRRRR   "
826884,leaf4,2013-12-27 19:39:00,2466,now that's just plain rude
826895,kickingfrog,2013-12-27 21:09:00,8333,Depends on where it was parked.
826899,Handlebarz,2013-12-27 21:16:00,3790,When I lived in Sudbury you would be considered lucky if your car was still on the street after a night time snow storm. I saw lots of cars with large snow piles in front and behind them over the years I lived there.
826925,misfish,2013-12-27 22:48:00,29133,"Rob. Food basic essa rd lot .  To me,this is just ignorance of the snow plow operator.  BTW,this pile is in the middle of the parking lot."
826926,Fisherman,2013-12-27 22:59:00,7201,Maybe no overnight overnight parking allowed and the snow fell all around it..
826932,kickingfrog,2013-12-27 23:16:00,8333,Better then a tow.
826940,BillM,2013-12-28 00:12:00,17367,"Food Basics should charge them for overnight parking, lol!"
826945,fishnsled,2013-12-28 00:41:00,3520,What if it is an employees car that was working?
826952,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-28 01:16:00,2582,Don't know the circumstance. But if it is marked as no overnight parking and it was parked in the area the snow removal guys usually pile up the snow...I say to bad so sad....next time read the sign moron.  Hell I'd love to be the snow removal guy in that situation. You wouldn't find the car until spring then
826964,danc,2013-12-28 02:24:00,4677,Glad it's not mine either. Not because of the snow. Because it's a GM product.
827014,Sinker,2013-12-28 04:50:00,8692,This is exactly what I'm thinking.  S.
827020,misfish,2013-12-28 10:41:00,29133,"I,ll have another look this morning on my way to the perch grounds. Im suppose to be there around ish time.."
