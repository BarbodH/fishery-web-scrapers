You are a master at this and anyone here who wants to learn about how to fish and presents reports should download this report and record it for safekeeping. Thank you Drew. This is the best Christmas present you could have given me."

826506,ehg,2013-12-24 20:33:00,2666,"Us fishing enthusiasts are lucky you provide the best of (largest,  multi-species) fishing in Ontario   I like how you target the spots where the biggest fish are most accessible seasonally.  I remember a decade ago seeing posts elsewhere by you. Now the biggest musky in the world are on your doorstep. Awesome to see you putting your skills to the test and then sharing with the community.  Many thanks."

826531,Skud,2013-12-24 23:26:00,739,It will be tough to beat a year like this one but I am sure you will have fun trying.
826536,NAC,2013-12-25 00:30:00,369,"So many great fish in just one season, with unreal photos to relive the memories.  Very nice!  The speckies really intrigue me but I'd love a shot at those big gar.  All the best in 2014!"
826751,Moosebunk,2013-12-26 15:16:00,3970,"Thanks fellas.  Appreciated.  Never left Ontario this past year and that says something about our great fishing opportunities.  From an hours drive or less, to one full long days tour north, south or west, it's incredible the trophy fisheries available.  Having the options these past few years to hit the road and try anything is something quite enjoyed.  Roy, TJ & Mods.  Thanks for keeping this great place afloat for all of us over the years.  For myself and the reports, most have always been supportive and kind when dropping a line, it's lead to some good things.  In times when it seems many other sites are slowing down or folding up, it has to be both the membership and leadership of a site that keeps people interested and keeps it going.  A week, sometimes a day doesn't go by when many of us have to make time to pop in here and see what's up with the people who make this ""a community.""  Thanks again for providing this place for us all.  Happy Holidays."
