826793,Fang,2013-12-26 21:47:00,1330,Just picked one up from BPS.  I've been playing with it and it is very sharp and clear. Will hopefully get it wet over next few days. I bought it for scouting structure and not to have it on all day. I had an older aqua vu and it was just way too big for me to haul around
826801,Sebastian,2013-12-26 22:43:00,208,Just picked one up few weeks ago. Used it three times. Worked well. Very clear and excellent battery life. I will get a camera panner for it because finding your lure can be tricky. In murky water with current on Quinte i was still able to see walleye come up to my jig.
