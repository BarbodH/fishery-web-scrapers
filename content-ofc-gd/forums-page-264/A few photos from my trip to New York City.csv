We stayed in Midtown at 48th and Lexington, a few blocks from Time Square and Central Park.   Hard to believe that while central and southern Ontario were being hit with the snow and ice this was the weather in NYC:   We walked 17-20kms each day.  Brooklyn Bridge from underneath Manhattan Bridge:   Manhattan Bridge:   Brooklyn Bridge:   Brooklyn Bridge with Manhattan Bridge in background:   Walkway between the bridges with roads above:   Sunset at Battery Park:     Always an angler, or two, around:   Bottom of Wall Street:   Union Square (No, that's not us)   While walking up along the outside of Central Park on the west side this Red-tailed Hawk came swooping in and landed in the tree right above us. About ten years ago I saw a PBS show about a hawk living on the side of an apartment building on the Upper East side of the Park. Lots of squirrels and pigeons around for them   Central Park on the west side somewhere just south of 104th:   A street performer in Central Park:   The kids in the park loved this (So did this kid. He was the only one that I felt compelled to toss a few bucks):     I went to the Leaf's game on Monday night:   One last photo after the game: "

827142,captpierre,2013-12-29 01:38:00,2521,"A must trip for everybody.  The place is totally alive.    Pretty much solid concrete with a 700 acre park in the middle -forest, meadow and small lakes  Not cheap.  Best way to see it is with double decker, open top Hop 'n Go buses with live tour guides.  around $35 for 2 days.  Hotel room on Manhatten Island $200+, more in high season.  Way cheaper if you stay in the burbs.  Take the wifey.....and earn fishing time back home"
827204,Rizzo,2013-12-29 17:33:00,4754,"ya my wife has been interested in doing this too...me? Not so much. But like previously said, would earn me some fishing time!"
