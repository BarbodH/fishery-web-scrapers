I will package them in a PVC tube (Courtesy of Craig Im Hooked) longest will be one piece big nasty (Thanks Dan)> I am in Toronto  Any advice of who to use seems I cant take them as oversized on the plane"
826898,aplumma,2013-12-27 21:15:00,6896,Here in the States Either UPS or FedEx are our two main carriers. They will deliver to residential as well as commercial buildings and seem to take the best care of packages.    Art
826903,Handlebarz,2013-12-27 21:18:00,3790,My friend said west jet allows long packages so he brought them with him. Another friend was on a small plane so he could not bring the long rods. I would guess it would be best to as the airline if you can send them with you
826919,Gregoire,2013-12-27 22:19:00,1397,Just sell me your LT's and buy new ones in Chicago. It will be cheaper than shipping.
826958,cowanjo,2013-12-28 01:24:00,249,Dan I have already talked to tim - thinking buy on musky first then resell after two weeks - way cheaper - you don't need to buy they are in the garage and you have a key to cottage and boat - therefore you have access to all you need.  Jim said I can try the new gloomis - but what if this really impacts my fishing - mike parker would hunt me down for not winning.....maybe he will never let me in his boat again and there goes my pb chance!
827024,spincast,2013-12-28 12:05:00,3279,"Try giving Greyhound a  call. They used to offer package shipping and it was dirt cheap compared to the other modes. I haven't shipped this way in years, but I'm pretty sure they still do within Canada. You drop off and pick up at the station. Your  challenge is going to be the customs documents for unaccompanied goods. There is a special entry that has to be done for that type of shipment, even if it is used. Expect them to be opened by customs each way as the tubes would be the size and shape they might be interested in - especially as unaccompanied goods, so insuring them with the carrier might be a thought."
827045,Handlebarz,2013-12-28 16:24:00,3790,I will let you in the boat just leave them St.croix here and get yourself some new ones on the trip.
827145,HTHM,2013-12-29 02:02:00,4082,My friend said west jet allows long packages so he brought them with him. Another friend was on a small plane so he could not bring the long rods. I would guess it would be best to as the airline if you can send them with you I can confirm have had my rods with me when I flew out west. It goes into oversized baggage.
