826640,jbailey,2013-12-25 17:42:00,866,Les Stroud's documentary about moving off the grid I found it pretty interesting and thought I'd share with anyone who hasn't already seen it.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwQxqBBut8s
826717,Tim Mills,2013-12-26 04:16:00,476,Thanks for posting. I remember seeing the original doc of him and his wife living in the woods for about a year.  Was the cabin they built north of thunder bay?  She got pregnant so they moved back to civilization.

He must have good friends or lots of money to helicopter in lumber, bring in crews and heavy equipment up a bush road to his back 150. Not everyone can get completely off the grid but something to think about with increasing energy costs."

Yea, it was weird when he was saying he didn't want to pay 9-10 grand to have a well drilled but he was able to fly lumber in via helicopter?! I can't imagine that being very cheap."
