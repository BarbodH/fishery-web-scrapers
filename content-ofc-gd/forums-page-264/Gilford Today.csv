826829,Bassnbows,2013-12-27 04:47:00,58,Went out at about 6:30am and fished till about 2. Fishing action was non stop as soon the jig/minnow combo was down. Plenty of small one's for the first few hours. Probably got about 40-50 of those. Then at about 9:30 the jumbos showed up for an hours or so. Some getting up to 12-13'.  Opted to just stay in the one spot. Plenty of ice where i was about 8'. I was only in about 7ft. of water with a little weeds around. Plenty of guys way out. Most were getting just small ones and plenty of them apparently. Be back there soon. Good luck.  Pics to follow.
