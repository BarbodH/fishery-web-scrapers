826293,Beans,2013-12-23 23:03:00,3339,Back in the late 50's and the 60's when I worked as a waiter/bartender I had Christmas off but not New Years Eve...  I stopped drinking in the early 70's and volunteered to man the phones at the crises center for a few years so that others could be with their families at Christmas time...
826294,misfish,2013-12-23 23:21:00,29133,"Off this year, usually the way it works at our place is the guys with older kids or no kids cover for guys with a young family on Christmas . When I first started I covered every Christmas I could. Nice to see 12 years later guys pay it back :-)   Sweet. Nice of them."

826305,GBW,2013-12-23 23:56:00,8460,"I haven't in decades BUT this time next year, maybe...  Because my kids are with my Ex I could work but I changing jobs recently and I'm not 100% up on the systems to offer to fill in for someone else to have the day(s) off.  I bet I get stuck with working it next year when it's my year to have the kids for Christmas..."
826312,Ron,2013-12-24 00:14:00,1683,"On call Christmas day. Same as all the other years I have been self employed. Last year was special, I had an elderly lady at one of the condos call me up. She went on about how her grand children bought her this beautiful chandelier. She wanted me to install it for her Christmas day so that she could share her present with her grand kids for dinner that night.I told her ""sure"" but warned her about the price first. I explained to her that it's Christmas and it's time to be with your family. She politely told me that is why she wanted the light up. I then explained I have family as well, gave her the price to install as it is emergency service rates, triple time, 8 hour minimum. She decided that it wasn't that important to take me away from my family either."

826202,Handlebarz,2013-12-23 13:48:00,3790,Not here I have not worked either in 17-20 years. In my teen years I would work Christmas if needed so others with little kids could have it off. I have not and will not miss a Christmas with my kids New Years well it does not matter near as much it's just another day. We always do stuff as a family but I would rather miss it then Christmas

Closed again at noon on the 31st and back in on the 2nd. Taking the Friday (27th) off to let my techs have a 5 day holiday. Hopefully they don't eat and drink to much and come back refreshed; because I'm going to eat and drink way to much. LOL It's good to be the boss; sometimes.  Dan.
