I've been wondering about saving gps locations when out on the hard water with my phone.  The phone I have is a Kyocera Rise if that makes any difference. Just want a simple app that works, but when doing a search on Google Playstore I'm left scratching my head with which one to get.  Any suggestions?"
826095,GBW,2013-12-22 23:47:00,8460,You know you can get a Navoinics app?  I have it on my Note3 and plan to use it every time I hit the ice and water.
826100,kickingfrog,2013-12-23 00:09:00,8333,Second vote for navionics. I have it on my android. Best paid app that I've bought.
826120,porkpie,2013-12-23 01:12:00,2521,"I use an iPhone, but I also have navionics on it.  For fishing, it can't be beat!"
826136,misty river,2013-12-23 02:14:00,3,"after downloading the navionics app to my samsung s3,i also added the app to my asus 10 inch tablet at no extra charge.this tablet has a built in gps receiver ,therefore no wifi or data plan needed for it to function.other than viewing  it in direct sunlight[jacket over the head ] and waterproofing[common sense and a ziplock baggie] you can,t beat the versatility and price for a 10 inch chart plotter with software"
826510,Afraz,2013-12-24 21:13:00,250,NAVIONICS FTW !!!
826581,Rich,2013-12-25 10:14:00,3927,"There is one called ""my fishing companion"" as well where you can mark spots and even include a picture of the spot and a description. It is more of a journal but I've used it many times as a GPS locator for old spots as well.  Get the full version or just get the navionics.. much more in depth but I was too cheap for that! Lol"
826836,adolson,2013-12-27 08:33:00,783,"OruxMaps is the only GPS app I would use on my phone, but I like free and I like controlling the maps that I use. I doubt any potential advantages Navionics has would even help me on the lakes I fish.  But nowadays I have an actual Garmin GPS unit anyhow."
