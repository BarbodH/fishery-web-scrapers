Both kids Cadence (2.5 years old) and Hudson (4.5 years old) loved looking at them till it was ... awkward.  When we got home Hudson ran to his bedroom and got the tackle box he got for Christmas.  He was very excited.  Cadence got into the fish first and caught more than half of the 20 to 30 dinks.  My wife and I thought is was only fair to put Hudson over by Cadence's hole.  These kids sure love catching.  We saw a permanent hut get put out onto the lake too.  Didn't think you were allowed to put them out till Jan 1st.  Good times.  I think I'll have to take them out again tomorrow.  Entropy  PS.  There is a good 10"" to 12"" of ice with about 2"" or 3"" of slush on top of that, then a hard packed crust of snow that you can walk/almost walk on."

My son (4.5) years old has his own step stool to reach the tanks behind the counter at my local bait shop, he is allowed to catch my minnows for me.  Thanks for sharing, got to love kids enthusiasm."
