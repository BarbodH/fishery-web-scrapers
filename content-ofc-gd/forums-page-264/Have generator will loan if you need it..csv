826077,Big Cliff,2013-12-22 22:58:00,6899,"It looks like we are out of danger of loosing power here and I have a 6500 watt generator that I would be happy to loan to anyone that needs it. It is a big heavy one so you'd need a pickup or trailer but it is available if you can come and get it. I'd deliver it but a friend has my trailer and I don't have a truck.  I realize that anyone needing it might not have internet access right now so if you know someone that is stuck or have been in touch via texting, just give me a call 705-328-0577"
826088,Entropy,2013-12-22 23:15:00,747,"Again, he offers his genny.  Last time you did the same.  A good guy."
826089,irishfield,2013-12-22 23:17:00,26272,"Cliff's always a good guy... I just hope he's not in too much of a hurry to loan it out. Still freezing rain here onto the 8"" of snow that fell, and I'm sure it's  probably heading East as time goes on.."
826090,davey buoy,2013-12-22 23:19:00,5505,What a great offer!!!!
826149,crappieperchhunter,2013-12-23 02:54:00,2582,We where without power here in Oshawa from 11PM Saturday night until 9PM tonight. Kept the place warm with the woodstove going and went and got takeout sushi...sorry Cliff I know it's one of your fav's....for supper tonight and ate it at the kitchen table with a bottle of white wine and the coleman lantern for lighting. Not your typical Sunday night here in the city  Thx for the offer though Cliff.
826155,Beans,2013-12-23 03:33:00,3339,"Thanks for the offer Cliff...no need for it so far here...  I just need to leave the doors open on the freezers out in the garage...-13,-23,-23*C the next three nights if the power goes out...LOL"
826185,wormdunker,2013-12-23 09:44:00,1711,That's a great offer for someone in need.  You're a good guy Cliff!  I considered purchasing one prior to the storm but held off.  Luckily we were without power for only 3 hours here in Fonthill (Niagara).  Lottsa branches to clean up though.
826188,Big Cliff,2013-12-23 10:21:00,6899,"Well, it isn't doing me any good just sitting here and I am sure there are plenty of people out there that would be glad to have it right now. There are still thousands of people without power and according to the Hydro One site some of them aren't going to be back up until tomorrow night."
