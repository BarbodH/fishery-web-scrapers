I went in today to get it.  I finally got myself one of them HD action cam thingies so I can get some kick donkey video and not worry about water and other nasty environmental stuff. Got a great deal online from the Source on this 1080 HD Extreme HD cam with all kinds of mounts, 2 batteries and micro HD card. It was on sale for $100 of @ only $129 so really couldn't go wrong. Now to figure out where to put mounts on my boats and sled.  "

826863,Twocoda,2013-12-27 17:05:00,4130,definitely on a ski of the sled...or if it has wide angle ...right on the front bumper if its possible.....hurry up and take it for a test run...love to see the results  just read the link you posted....definitely has wide angle...i think framed so you get both skis in the video and go for a scenic tour would be awesome...
