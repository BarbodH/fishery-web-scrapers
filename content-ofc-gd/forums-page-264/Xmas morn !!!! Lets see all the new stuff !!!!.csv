826790,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-26 20:59:00,8243,"Was able to spend yesterday with my elderly parents and have dinner with the family at the home we all grew up in. 24 for dinner, another 15 or so stopped in to wish all a Merry Christmas during the day.. It was the last meal there for us all as they are moving into a retirement residence in the new year. A dozen of us walked the neighborhood and we showed the Grandkids who lived where and who did this or that there. My wife and my gift was arranging it all and cooking the 40 pounds of turkey and of course the other 8 courses of food, man that's nuts. Everyone chipped in bringing food and cleaning up. Everyone except of course the few 20 something Italian Prince and Princesses, wouldn't want to take them away from their smart phones and wanting to know when we are going to open gifts because they were in a hurry to leave. I hope they enjoy their take out pizza next year.  If my wife and I need or should I say want stuff we go out and buy it. Stuff has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas.  I know it was supposed to be fishing related and is because we had a fish course for dinner as well."
