826861,kickingfrog,2013-12-27 16:56:00,8333,Plus it will be dark in a couple of hours.
826862,manitoubass2,2013-12-27 16:58:00,11391,"Pffft isnt it a ""dry"" cold though?"
826865,Joeytier,2013-12-27 17:25:00,3990,My typical cut-off is about -25.  Anything colder than that is just a sled ride for me
826872,Handlebarz,2013-12-27 18:15:00,3790,Dang I was upset we did not get above freezing today it's been 32 all day they called for 36 weather men go figure.
826873,Terry,2013-12-27 18:17:00,14456,this is where we separate the boys from the men
826882,manitoubass2,2013-12-27 19:30:00,11391,Ill go out in -40 but only near my house on the river. No way would i travel to fish in that cold lol. -25 is about my cutoff too
826890,misfish,2013-12-27 20:13:00,29133,"Once yer all set up in the hut and furnace is on. Who cares.LOL  Toasty toasty ,roasty roasty.  Fish on byes."
826891,irishfield,2013-12-27 20:36:00,26272,Meowww !
826905,Big Cliff,2013-12-27 21:23:00,6899,this is where we separate the boys from the men So true; the young boys go out and sit in the cold hoping to catch some. Us old men sit at home with our wives hoping to get some. In either case if you succeed it was a heck of a good day!
826908,misfish,2013-12-27 21:25:00,29133,  
826912,aplumma,2013-12-27 21:37:00,6896,Anything below -10 C has me deciding to either have heat on hand or not playing outdoors. I guess this puts me in the little boys category.    Art
826914,Terry,2013-12-27 21:41:00,14456,So true; the young boys go out and sit in the cold hoping to catch some. Us old men sit at home with our wives hoping to get some. In either case if you succeed it was a heck of a good day! exactly
826935,Nipfisher,2013-12-27 23:30:00,2449,Wimp.  Just Kidding.
826939,aplumma,2013-12-28 00:11:00,6896,Nope wimp fits I never claimed to be as cold tolerant as my Canadian friends. But to make the contest fair you get to come see me in August when it is in the 90's and not a dry heat...lol   Art
826942,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-28 00:29:00,10439,"Once yer all set up in the hut and furnace is on. Who cares.LOL  Toasty toasty ,roasty roasty.  Fish on byes.  Yeah, except my propane heater will not work at those temps because it is too cold for propane to vaporize."
827004,manitoubass2,2013-12-28 04:06:00,11391,"pffft, tiger torch that THING"
827012,DRIFTER_016,2013-12-28 04:35:00,10439,"pffft, tiger torch that THING  Only problem is it still runs on propane and propane will not vaporize @ -40 it stay liquid and there is next to no pressure in the tank. I have to heat my BBQ tank with a 1500 watt electric heater to cook dinner."
827015,manitoubass2,2013-12-28 05:05:00,11391,"Meh really? I know ive used propane in colder temps back in the oil patch. Just had to heat it first, which is very sketchy at best lol. Would never do it nowadays. I went out today had nice temps, about -10. Had a blast but only caught 3 walleye in 6 hours. Kids had fun though plus we went sliding  good times"
827027,Rod Caster,2013-12-28 13:46:00,5784,"You never heard of a tire fire? That burns at any temp and really puts of the heat, and little pieces of scalding rubber."
