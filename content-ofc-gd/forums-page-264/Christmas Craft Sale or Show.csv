Ice flies, made for gills and perch but this winter I may try them on a windlass tip up with a couple split shot for whities. $3.50    Viva, a small stillwater streamer for browns or bows. $2.50    Hopper fly, for aggressive river trout in late summer. $2.50    Rabbit leech, a great steelhead pattern for deep water. $3    A mouse topwater, extremely buoyant with great movement. $5  "

820103,Rod Caster,2013-11-25 01:14:00,5784,"Cool. I like this. Thanks Art.   My wife makes and sells lip balm. Her brand is ""SIMPLY CHAP"" It is made with three base ingredients: Coconut Oil, Beeswax and Vitamin E Oil. Also available is added: Selected Essential Oils (Grapefruit and Eucalyptus). Good for the fishermen, fisherwomen and the fisherkids in the family. The stuff works really well as a hand balm too, especially in winter.  $5 each, no tax    PM me your email and/or phone number and she'll make contact with you ASAP. Or, visit her facebook page http://www.facebook.com/simplychap and send her a message."

I'll probably post a bunch of stuff up here but to start off I'll put up some basic nuke egg patterns, great pattern for steelhead, can be tied in just about any colour combination. I can also do normal eggs if you prefer. $2 each, $5 off and free shipping for any order over $25.  If you want to see other examples of my work visit www.yetifish.com  "

They are made on Japanese Rice Paper, using the actual fish, printer block ink and then the red stamp is my signature in Japanese characters.  I'm asking $45 each, your choice of which print, plus shipping (or they can be picked up for free).  They look really awesome framed.  This one is 25.5 x 19, but can be cut to fit any frame. - This one is SOLD     This one is 19 x 13 (can be cut to fit any frame) - SOLD     Also 19 x 13     Again, 19 x 13  "

This pattern has taken just about all of my steelhead in the last year, I usually tie it quite big (size 4-6) but of course smaller sizes are available, along with other colours to match your river.  And I'll give an amazing discount on these, $1.25 a piece, usually they would be $2.50.     (Al, if you feel I'm clogging this thread up just say the word and I'll stop)"
820737,bigugli,2013-11-27 13:56:00,6138,"Wish I had time to post into this earlier, but here are a couple of things the son and I put together to feed our addiction.  Micro bucktails for crappie  1/32 and 1/16 size heads. Too many colour patterns to list or display. 9 head colours: Blue, pearl, orange, green, purple, black, brown, white, chartreuse The hair is left a little longer intentionally. Some like varying hair lengths on the jig. Some also use them trouting.  3 for $5   Bucktail worm harnesses  Just a sampling of the patterns available. Really effective on a slow troll or drift.  3 for $10  Just pm me and we can work outing getting them to you"

821225,Christopheraaron,2013-11-30 00:29:00,3525,"#5, the scud. Last winter a lot of you guys were interested in ""the Simcoe bug"", the bug is nothing more than a VERY crude representation of a scud (freshwater shrimp). These shrimp are one of the main food sources for perch when they are hanging out in the weeds and are great when fish are finicky. This fly is probably 100x more realistic than ""the bug"" and works very well on the heavily pressured fish. You can fish it by itself but it will take a while to get down 10 feet, so I like to drop shot it with a micro tube and jig below it, works very well!  On sale for $2 (Sorry for the price increase, but since posting I'm on the hook for about 100 flies)  "
