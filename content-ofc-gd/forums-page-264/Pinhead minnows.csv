826856,Big Cliff,2013-12-27 16:19:00,6899,Tried everyone I can think of in the Lindsay area can't find anyone with pinhead minnows. Causeway Bait in Port Perry said they should have some in later this afternoon. Anyone know of anything closer?
826858,irishfield,2013-12-27 16:34:00,26272,"Time to embrace new methods Cliff... you could be fishing by now without live bait!  = sorry, can't help on a bait dealer!"

Those FinS minnows you used with Steve in the fall might produce...  Did you try Mark's Bait and Tackle up this way?  Jiggin' Raps are good through the ice..."
826874,Steve,2013-12-27 18:41:00,2075,hamilton is too far i'm guessing?  bills bait has them on a wholesale level.

Jiggin' Raps are good through the ice... FinS Minnows and Shads work awesome through the ice for perch and crappie. Not sure what species your after Cliff.
826880,misfish,2013-12-27 19:25:00,29133,Tear drops and Berkly maggots produced well for me yesterday Cliff. Drop the live bait.
826902,Big Cliff,2013-12-27 21:18:00,6899,"Thanks guys, I do use most of the above (as most of you know) but I have some friends here and they need all the help they can get LOL."
826904,Freshtrax,2013-12-27 21:20:00,2215,I'm still a sucker for live bait

826910,Big Cliff,2013-12-27 21:27:00,6899," Teach them,oh Cliff ya son. Teach them. They are grass hoppers. It's pikeslayer and his son-in-law, need I say more!"
826913,aplumma,2013-12-27 21:40:00,6896,"I find meal worms at most pet stores that sell food for reptiles. They are cheaper than the baitshop and usually in better shape.  BTW I have never been mad enough to call my minnows pinheads, some of fishing partners yes but not my bait.   Art"
826916,misfish,2013-12-27 21:48:00,29133,"It's pikeslayer and his son-in-law, need I say more!   NOPE.  "
826937,BillM,2013-12-27 23:41:00,17367,Go to a pet store and get some live wax worms... Killer for perch/crappie/whatever.  A lot easier to keep alive compared to minnows as well (cheaper to!).   Just keep them in the fridge when you're not using them or they'll hatch.
826946,Pikeslayer,2013-12-28 01:02:00,1443,"Crossed the border & picked up some pinheads in Rochester NY (HST FREE!!) circled LO & re-entered Canada through Gananoque (or something like that). Limited out on Sturgeon in 90 minutes. Busy eating our limit now as we have 36 dozen pinheads left for tomorrow  ps. ....."".........."
826947,HTHM,2013-12-28 01:05:00,4082,"So you caught nothing? Seeing as the limit on sturgeon is zip, zero, nada. (I think)"
826948,Pikeslayer,2013-12-28 01:09:00,1443,Perch Albert  tons o' perch. Plus no limit on Pinheads..
826968,HTHM,2013-12-28 02:40:00,4082,"Boy, am I thick....."
827088,Big Cliff,2013-12-28 20:27:00,6899,"Ya well exactly as expected when fishing with pikeslayer, one fish caught by his son-in-law and that was it for 4 hours of fishing LOL. Doesn't matter it was still a wonderful visit and we did get out fishing!"
827090,misfish,2013-12-28 20:31:00,29133,HHMMMM  Tear drop and maggots produced well for us today Cliff.  But I hear ya. Simons a good fella to hang with .
827091,Big Cliff,2013-12-28 20:39:00,6899,"HHMMMM  Tear drop and maggots produced well for us today Cliff.  But I hear ya. Simons a good fella to hang with . We tried meal worms, rapalla jigs, minnows, Berkley power maggots, Fin S minnows (all my old go tos and a few other things) the bite was very light, they just didn't seem hungry and even when they did hit a minnow you'd hardly see your rod tip move. Tomorrow I'm going for some rainbows, we'll see how that goes!"
827092,misfish,2013-12-28 20:45:00,29133,Visit to the fish munger dosent count Cliff.
