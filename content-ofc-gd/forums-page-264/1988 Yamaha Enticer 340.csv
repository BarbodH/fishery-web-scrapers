826168,nancur373,2013-12-23 04:59:00,1211,Here's my little beater sled. 1987 Skidoo Citation 250. It's going to get a nice restoration job during the off season. Nice and light compared to my big 1000cc Yamaha.    A.K.A the short track Tundra. Those were great. Tippy but fun and easy to toss around. p.s. great Newfie stitching.
826170,tb4me,2013-12-23 06:15:00,3295,Here is my ride..A fully restored John Deere Sportfire 440.. Tough reliable sleds..Here she is a Deere get together..
826171,Moosebunk,2013-12-23 06:20:00,3970,"Great buy.  The Enticers are a perfect machine for the sensible rider looking for a work horse and reliable sled for ice fishing.  Was it not around 2005 when they stopped making them?  This winter is shaping up to be a wicked snowy one.  Glad this rain is thickening up the snow and surface crusts, should help keep the Bravo floating up on top.  Some wicked pics too BTW."
826217,nancur373,2013-12-23 15:43:00,1211,"Couldn't find a pic anywhere but my first sled I bought myself was a 1986 Polaris LT 440. Fan cooled, extra long articulating track with the big storage rack. Found this picture but the LT was black and blue and longer obviously.  "

826255,glen,2013-12-23 20:16:00,2641,I like the look of those old sleds.  Here is a few I had.
826437,chris.brock,2013-12-24 13:24:00,4053," wow, looks mint, very cool, it's good to see that you run it too (gently I assume) I like the old Liquifires and Spitfires (cylinder head sticking through the cowl) too"
826438,chris.brock,2013-12-24 13:30:00,4053,nice Glen  the super brute looks like where Yamaha got their inspiration for the Phazer the old blizzards and super sonics always looked tough

826499,chris.brock,2013-12-24 20:10:00,4053,"here's a couple more, these are pictures of pictures so they aren't great  83 or 84 SS 440, nice moustache too    I strayed from Yamaha and bought this Intruder 440, I think a cool looking sled    like DanC's, an ET 300, 1980, the coolest thing about this picture is my hair  "
826503,Bill Shearer,2013-12-24 20:25:00,456,"All those sleds are still a long way from my Olympic 24 hp. Skidoo! Can't remember the year, early 70s. Brings back a lot of fun memories. When I had that machine, no licenses were required, and you could drive them on the roads. Thanks for posting those great pics of yesteryear!"
826569,HTHM,2013-12-25 04:19:00,4082,It's too bad JohnF isn't here to tell some of the stories he had from racing sleds. I miss that man.
826603,Bernie,2013-12-25 13:13:00,3190,"This was back in 1989. My daughter and her friend driving a couple of early 70's.These old sleds were almost bullet proof and surprisingly quick in their day. Had I kept them, they would likely still run.  "

We put a set of ape hanger high bars on it, a set of ""highway pegs"" coming off the cowling, Painted it jet black and put chrome snow screens on it then took it watercross for a few afternoons it was awesome"
825684,kenzy31,2013-12-21 13:09:00,261,"I just picked up the above sled for ice fishing this season. Great little machine, good shape, and got a good deal on the price. I have a few questions for those that know.  1) Should I remove the oil jug right away and go with mixed gas? I did this on my mid 80's Johnson 60hp outboard a few years back for fear of blowing it up!  2) I'm getting a little low on my compression reading -- 100lbs in left cylinder and 105lbs in right. They're within the 10% of each other but should I be concerned about the actual readings? Bear in mind I just bought a $30 one from Part Source.  3) Does anyone have an Enticer they've modified for ice fishing? Help give me some advice! I'm looking for backrest and cargo basket ideas  Thanks for any help, cheers! Jesse"
825692,chris.brock,2013-12-21 14:32:00,4053,"that's a great little sled, likely one of the most reliable models ever made, me and my friends had a few of them over the years  I have an older Bravo and Phazer now,  we never went to pre-mix, and never had any oil injection failures, but I'm sure it has happened,  as for the compression, sounds a little low, if it's hard to start, the engine may need some rings at least  give these guys a call about a backrest  https://www.royaldistributing.com/"
825693,Sandbag,2013-12-21 14:35:00,533,"Great choice for an ice fishing sled in my opinion.  1.  I would check that the oil injection is working and if it is, i would leave it hooked up and use it.  I find mixing fuel a major pain but that is more of a personal preference i guess.  Yamaha Enticer is a pretty simple machine to work on and ensure injection is functioning.  2.  With those compression reading, I would consider a top end rebuild in the future at some point, but i would run it as is for the season.  I believe new rings and piston should put you up around 130lbs.  3.  can't help you with the ice fishing mods but have seen dozens with built on boxes for gear and auger racks.  Good luck and enjoy.  Very durable and light machine.  Perfect for the ice.  Cheers  Craig"
825694,Bernie,2013-12-21 14:35:00,3190,Make sure you open the throttle when you do the compression test.It can affect the readings if it can't get air to replenish what is exhausted.
825695,Renegade67,2013-12-21 14:37:00,86,"Oil injection issues was more with the 3 cylinder Johnson's/omc.   If your concerned you could just put a mark on the bottle and keep an eye on it to make sure its using some. The compression is a little low but it could run for long time yet. You could rebuild the fuel pump as the diaphram is probably getting old.   Fairly easy to do just make sure you clean both surfaces well.  you could use a razor blade. My friend just got one, I think it was an 83.  Cleaned the carb, rebuilt the fuel pump, and its running like a champ.  Such a fun sled!"
825700,i2cool2fool,2013-12-21 15:35:00,349,Great sled. I'll never sell my '90 Phazer II.

I thought to operate a snowmobile on public property you have to be 12 years old minimum with a motorized snow vehicle operator's licence (MSVOL).

After raising 3 kids I have never heard of such a thing..I always thought as long as its insured and plated your fine no matter who is driving it..Never had an issue ever with police or the wife.....lol My kids grew up on sleds.
825769,irishfield,2013-12-21 21:39:00,26272,I remember my son getting his MSVOL so he could drive around with his grandfather on the trail when he turned 12... and still had to have an adult drive it across highways to be legal if I remember correctly.. or the MSVOL was so he could drive it across the highway drawing a blank on that one.
825790,Nipfisher,2013-12-21 22:52:00,2449,He is only allowed to drive it around the shack. Never goes off the lake and never out of eye sight. We have had OPP and C.O.s around and they never said anything. It may not be legal but it is minimal risk if any. Now if he was on a 800cc sled ripping around then I am sure it could be a problem.
825803,nancur373,2013-12-21 23:36:00,1211,"Read this post this morning and it inspired me to pull the old girl off the trailer. Been sitting for damned near 4 years. all the gas evaporated in the tank. Dropped some oil in the cylinders and pulled over a few times. Put in some fresh gas. Couldn't get the primer to pick up fuel. Frigged around for half an hour priming and pulling. Then it dawned on me.......fuel shut off valve....   Opened valve and primer picked up right away. First pull and she fired right up. Noticed a whole lot of smoke and oil around the exhaust manifold. seems 4 out of 8 bolts had rattled loose and 3 of the remaining 4 were loose. Guess the mechanic who rebuilt the engine 5 years ago didn't think to tighten them or use thread lock. So off to the hardware store for bolts, lock washers, brake kleen, gasket maker, thread lock, and some prestone to top up. Cleaned up all parts and put back together. Will fire it up tomorrow or sunday and give her a go. Now to find the ownership and get insurance and get on the ice.  "
