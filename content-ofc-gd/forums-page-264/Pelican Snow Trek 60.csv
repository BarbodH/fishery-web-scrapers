822300,chris.brock,2013-12-05 15:14:00,4053,"I bought one too at 1/2 price, a good deal! I called about the optional tow bar, it was too expensive so I'll make my own.  somebody should take Purenewf up on his offer"
822318,Joeytier,2013-12-05 17:08:00,3990,I bought the sled and tow bar.  Looks to be a nice sled package but the cover they sell for it for 30 bucks is a rip off.  I'll be making my own.
822561,nancur373,2013-12-07 00:39:00,1211,only good for 30 days guys. and yeah make your own cover way cheaper and better
822573,Entropy,2013-12-07 01:10:00,747,"I picked this up when it was on sale, it is great for pulling the kids throught the forest and along the shore."
822581,nancur373,2013-12-07 01:32:00,1211,It has lot's of uses. was thinking someone may have missed it in the flyer or couldn't get to the store that week.
826723,pisces,2013-12-26 05:06:00,3,PURENEWF - Please let me know if the raincheck is still available and where you are located (I sent PM)... thanks
826727,davey buoy,2013-12-26 12:25:00,5505,"PURENEWF - Please let me know if the raincheck is still available and where you are located (I sent PM)... thanks Look at this weeks CT flyer,not a bad deal either."
826736,Burtess,2013-12-26 14:12:00,901,"Shappell Jet Sled 1 is about the same size at 54"" X 25"" X 10"" and is regular price at BassPro for around $37 if I remember correctly, bought one earlier in the season.  Has a more gradual taper so it may be easier to put as well.  Burt"
826737,davey buoy,2013-12-26 14:16:00,5505,"I kept the original pull rope on my Otter,but guys if your loaded down like I am most times,I added two corner loop pull ropes.No more hitting heels,A guy off to each side.25-30 min walk,makes the pull so much easier. Just a thought."
826761,pisces,2013-12-26 16:32:00,3,"Thanks davey buoy and burtess. This weeks pelican 45 has ONE bad ""tippy"" rating otherwise OK I work 2 blocks from Bass Pro so I may check out the Shappell  CT user comments (3 good, 1 bad) "
826762,BillM,2013-12-26 16:35:00,17367,"Any sled will be 'tippy' without a towbar attached to it.  With a towbar, I can't see how that's even possible."
826766,Joeytier,2013-12-26 17:34:00,3990,Yup.  I broke trail into a back lake through 3 feet of powder the other day and it worked great lol
826816,John Bacon,2013-12-27 02:12:00,3277,I think the Pelican 45 is more of a hand pull sled.  I have a couple.  I like the small size because I can put two in the back of my GMC Jimmy without having to fold the seats down.  It works well for me; I have not tried using it behind a vehicle.
