Art   I remember as a kid (1971 when i was 3 or 4) we used to go to Christie Pits Park on Bloor. That was some hill! After we would always  go to a place called Ed's Ice Cream Parlour (not to be confused with the one at The Beaches now). Hot fudge sundae and a nickel in the duke box to play The Popcorn Song………..WOW….I loved Techno music before there was techno music LOLOL.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_wy_Pr1bqM&list=RDNjxNnqTcHhg
