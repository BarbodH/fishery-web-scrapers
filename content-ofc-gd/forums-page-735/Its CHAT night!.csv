426124,Greencoachdog,2010-01-26 23:31:00,8163,"Yeah, it's been disabled for the ""ramp up to the new board""... that was 3 weeks ago!!!  I remember when the last board was nuked, we had a new board up in 3 DAYS!!!  I guess some folks feel that just because they don't participate, no one else will miss it!  ... or they're scared that someone will say something that hasn't ever been said before on there before... like that could happen!  I feel the same way you do Sinker!... I miss it and think someone is slacking!"
426125,Greencoachdog,2010-01-26 23:36:00,8163," I love the abuse Bernie!!!... beat me, make me eat soap, and write bad checks!!!     Who give a rat's patootie aboot the imposters... I ignore them and tell them I'm gonna do it!"

426188,Bernie,2010-01-27 02:23:00,3190,Keep talking like that and they will have to get the chat back on line.
426192,Sinker,2010-01-27 02:37:00,8692,"    Keep it going Glen. They'll either ban us all, or get chat up and running.  Maybe we should go on strike??"
426202,douG,2010-01-27 03:05:00,2693,"I demand a 20% increase in something something something.  I dunno, I'll get back.  Wait, this isn't chat?  I'm doing this wrong."

426213,highdrifter,2010-01-27 03:16:00,2534," You saw Avatar too huh??!  That line was such a joke!!  HELL NO WE WON""T GO!!"

426219,Bernie,2010-01-27 03:29:00,3190,"In chat we can post stuff like this.  Conversation in a Oklahoma Bar  A guy walks into a bar in Tulsa and orders a white wine. All the hillbillies sitting around the bar look up, expecting to see some pathetic Yankee from the north. The bartender says, ""You ain't from around here, are ya?"" The guy says, ""No, I'm from Collingwood, Ontario."" The bartender says, ""What do you do in Canada?"" The guy says, ""I'm a taxidermist."" The bartender says, ""A taxidermist? What in tarnation is a taxidermist? Do you drive a taxi?"" ""No, a taxidermist doesn't drive a taxi. I mount animals."" The bartender grins and hollers, ""It's okay boys. He's one of us."""

426273,Greencoachdog,2010-01-27 11:40:00,8163,"  I second that motion!... just because I'll talk to ya doesn't mean I necessarily want to see you!  I heave either met or seen pics of most of the chat users, and while you won't find any nicer folks anywhere.... I just gotta say... y'all is damn ugly!!!  ... except for Fidel... I think he's kinda cute."
426326,TJQ,2010-01-27 16:33:00,7806,"Were working on the new chat, but it has to be installed when we upgrade to the new version of the board (3.0), to be honest its so we can keep logs of the chat and only allow registered users on so we (big brother) - and the chatters know whose really who.  Until that time, which is coming soon, there's tons of free chat rooms out there.  This one offers private chats.  http://www.chatzy.com/"
