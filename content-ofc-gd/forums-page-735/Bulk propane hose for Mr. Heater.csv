I was at Princess Auto in Whitby today and bought the same 5' hose, but Mr. Heater brand, for $24.99! Coleman one has now been returned to CT..."
425863,e-z-out,2010-01-26 02:30:00,1052,I ran into the same thing with my Big buddy heater. Princess Auto is always the way to go.
425867,Fisherman,2010-01-26 02:43:00,7201,"Quick, run over to your local Wmart, I got a 4' hose about 2 weeks ago for $15, long enough to keep the tank out and the heater in the portable."

426081,Fisherpete,2010-01-26 21:57:00,1814,Lol... true enough! I was happy enough to save the $20... I was going there anyway to fill my propane tank.
426222,waterwolf,2010-01-27 03:32:00,556,slight redirect but still on propane subject.does anyone know where to find an adaptor to fill 1lb'ers from a 20 lb'er?
426225,irishfield,2010-01-27 03:34:00,26272,Yah... we did that thread before Christmas!  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...propane+adapter
426233,waterwolf,2010-01-27 03:48:00,556,"got it , thanks irish"
426236,irishfield,2010-01-27 03:59:00,26272,Took me about 2 weeks to get the one off Ebay.. 100% legit seller.
426241,fishhunter,2010-01-27 04:25:00,604,MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE FITLER ON THE HEATER IF YOUR RUNNING A HOSE FROM A BULK TANK!!!! THE RUBBER WILL CAUSE YOUR HEATER TO FAIL!!!!!!! YOU CAN GET THE FITER AT PRINCESS AUTO FOR $10. I THOUGHT THAT WAS ALOT OF BULL WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT TILL IT HAPPEND TO ME. AFTER I TOOK THE HEATER APART AND CLEANED IT I LEARNED ITS 100% TRUE. SAFE YOURSELF BEING COLD BUY THE FILTER!!!!!!!!!!!
