BUT HAD A HARD TIME WITH THE NORTHERNS.(WALLEYE 18-28INCH) (NORTHERN 24-38) LOTS OF WALLEYE BUT NOT MANY NORTHERNS. THIS IS MY FIRST POST ON (OFC) BEEN LOOKING AT ALL YOUR GREAT POSTINGS AND ENJOY READING THEM.   THANKS   STEVE
426278,Paully,2010-01-27 12:02:00,712,Welcome Aboard.. I've never fished it but im sure others will chime in..  Btw.. Turn off your CAPS LOCK..
426308,gdelongchamp,2010-01-27 14:58:00,199,Hmmmm. Lots of walleyes and few northerns.  That's what I call paradise.  Nungesser is a very large lake. Lots of bays. It has road access and fly in lodges. There is a very prominent ridge on the south side of the lake. We use to hunt moose below the ridge. Book your vacation in early spring just after ice out. Should be northerns in all of the shallows. Walleye will still be spanwing but will begin getting very active near fast water.
426319,kgeary,2010-01-27 15:45:00,82,"Hi Fish it Guppy just to clarify there is  no road access to Nungesser. there are logging roads near the south side but you cannot access Nungesser by any of those roads. you can onlhy reach the lake by going up the river and crossing a portage. We have a private boardwalk and use atvs to make the 300 yard crossing.   Fish It Nungesser actually has an unusual number of very large (46-52 inchers) Pike. There are other remote fly-in lakes with more numbers of 35-40 inch pike but I haven't found a lake with more of the HIgh end pike. And I've fished over 300 lakes all over Canada. When I talk about big pike I am refering to pike over 46 inches. You can Catch Big Pike any time of year.  How to fish can be a very long post. What time of year are fishing it? why that time of year? How do you like to fish. Are you stuck on those times and methods or do you just want to catch big Pike?  Rule number one. Go where the big pike are this means fish a lake that has big pike.  and then fish for big pike - not just for pike.  I have a bunch of articles on my website. look in the articles section http://www.anglerskingdom.com/   I have a bunch of reports on the ""2009 fishing reports and news"" section. http://anglerskingdom.blogspot.com/ lots of stuff on there so look around.  talk soon kg"

426829,kgeary,2010-01-28 19:59:00,82,"BIG PIKE, BIG WALLEYE, BIG MUSKY. THEY ARE ALL GOOD. (NUNGESSER DOESN'T HAVE MUSKY) KG"
426832,bigbuck,2010-01-28 20:07:00,2449,"Well, you are using pretty much the same techniques for the big pike as you would for big musky so.........it's all good as long as you catch one. On another note, you've got a nice website and I can tell the members from experience that the northern lakes fishing experience is second to none. Having fished LOTW for several years, the scenery and sheer beauty is incredible up on the shield lakes."
426871,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-01-28 21:48:00,158,I couldn't Agree More.  LOTW is paradise.
