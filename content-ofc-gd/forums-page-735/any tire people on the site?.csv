426203,purekgw,2010-01-27 03:06:00,585,"alright so i bought the 1998 dodge dakota sport 2wd and i am going to replace the tires im looking at these tires but im confused by the sizes, the ones on there now are 235/70 R15  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Au...er%252BRVXT.jsp  i just dont know what all the numbers and letters stand for.....  can i have seen bigger tires on the same rims but confused right now    any help?"
426208,GBW,2010-01-27 03:08:00,8460,"the 235 = width the 70 is profile hight R15, well those are on a 15"" rim/wheel"
426214,purekgw,2010-01-27 03:16:00,585,yah i get that its the p235/75r15 105s or LT235/75R15 C
426215,irishfield,2010-01-27 03:19:00,26272,P = passenger vehicle  LT = light truck  You don't need light truck on that truck..
426217,purekgw,2010-01-27 03:26:00,585,am i better off to get a light truck tire tho? theres only a little bit different prices
426221,irishfield,2010-01-27 03:31:00,26272,You sure wouldn't like the ride !!  LT's on a 1500 series truck are generally reserved for when you're plowing.. for the extra weight of the plow.. as they have more sidewall strength.
426232,purekgw,2010-01-27 03:48:00,585,so then would the dunlop radial RVXT  P235/75R15 105S  be fine on the truck?
426235,irishfield,2010-01-27 03:58:00,26272,Couldn't tell ya.. have never run dunlops. All depends on what you are looking for.. snow.. bare highway etc. A good tire shop is worth any extra funds.. if any. My local shop that I've used for 25 years has never steered me wrong when it came to proper tire selection for all our vehicles.
426237,purekgw,2010-01-27 04:00:00,585,alright thanks for help will have to stop in to local tire store in morning
426251,SBCregal,2010-01-27 05:02:00,688,"hard to go wrong with a set of michelin LTX tires.  definitely not the cheapest out there, but a great tire"
426269,mbac31,2010-01-27 10:32:00,904,I'm running the Dunlops this season and they are great so far. Little bit noisy on the asphalt  but otherwise a very nice tire
426275,Paully,2010-01-27 11:46:00,712,"you should check out Second Time Around tires .. they are located on progress at kennedy, He's got good prices on new tires plus free rotation on the life of the tire!"
426324,Governator,2010-01-27 16:26:00,879,"For what it's worth, please don't have Canadian Tire put the tires on for you.  I made the mistake once and could've paid my life for it.  They never torqued any of the wheels, needless to say about 2 days later driving down the 404 I hear and feel ""FUMP FUMP FUMP FUMP FUMP"".  Quickly stopped at the first dealership and sure enough the bolts were not torqued, they said my front right wheel could've fallen off at anytime.  Cdn tire gave full refund although I should've raised more hell."
426329,Fish4Eyes,2010-01-27 16:39:00,1022,"Call any tire place and ask them the same question you asked here. I would call 3 different places, as there is always an idiot you could run into.  Go to www.tirerack.com for all tire reviews. Good site. Has very good prices too for majority of tires. Ship the tires to a PO box, then cross the border, pick up the tires and have them changed at a garage in the States. This option allows you to leave a few extra bucks in your pocket."
426365,purekgw,2010-01-27 18:52:00,585,"well i went to a local tire shop and they end up giving me Firestone Destination A/T cheaper then the tires i was looking at with installation, free alignment and balancingand they have them in tomorrow  thanks for all the advice guys"
426373,Gerritt,2010-01-27 19:04:00,6129,  From the place on Argyle? they are a good shop and won't steer you wrong.. dealt with them a few times..  G
426377,purekgw,2010-01-27 19:13:00,585,yah right beside DQ i cant remember name tho
426379,Gerritt,2010-01-27 19:16:00,6129,they are good guys... and fairly priced to boot.
426505,F7Firecat,2010-01-28 00:48:00,347,"Buy the best tires you can afford, your life may depend on it one day  If your towing, plain and simple dont chince out buy quality if your gonna keep it for thel ife of the tires.  All depends if your in it for the long run or just dumping the vehicle in a year or so."
426512,kbc,2010-01-28 01:01:00,8,lt's are definatly worth the extra money if you are doing anything except driving back and forth to work you cant go wrong. i have lt's on my 4runner despite the tire guy telling me i should get passenger tires the ride is a little rougher but it can be tolerated for the added strenght of the tire on and off road.
426530,purekgw,2010-01-28 01:31:00,585,these are the tires here  http://www.1010tires.com/tire.asp?tirebran...Destination+A/T  good reviews about them
426541,T Fisher,2010-01-28 01:44:00,139,IF YOUR AFTER TIRES HEAD SOUTH.  I drive a Chevy Silverado pickup and it was time for new tires 265X75X16.  I shopped around like we all should looking for the best price.  I thought about buying in the USA.  To make a long story short I paid $496us for 4 Top of the line Yokohamas that I priced out in 6 different stores in Ontario at $1122.  I paid less then half the price for the same tires in BARFALO.  Being the romantic type I took the Mrs to a nice Dinner & The Casino in Niagara Falls and saved a bundle. Check it out B-4 YOU SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED $$$$$$
426672,fish_fishburn,2010-01-28 13:26:00,1311,CT lost my businees on tires about 30 yrs ago. I bought a set of tires in a private deal and took them to crappy to have them installed. Within five klicks there I was sitting in the middle of the street downtown with only 3 wheels on my car. Not only did I have to get towed but my centreline rim was damaged as well. A tire shop is the way to go.
