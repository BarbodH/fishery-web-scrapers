426130,holdfast,2010-01-26 23:46:00,1813,Yea between the storms I had a few hours of Ice Fishing on Cowan.  I wanted to try a walk in lake but with all this snow I figured Id stay close than risk getting stuck some where.  I had a couple of nibbles and stolen minnows which I figure must of been something else than Pike.  Anyways I decided to make my very first movies.  Heres my attempt with Spike playing Hockey and soccer.  Check out how energetic the little guy is.  what a hoot.  Hockey      Soccer        Ice fishing

The hyper activity of a Jack Russel and the endurance of a Beagle makes for an active little dog eh!    Those choppers could do some damage to an ankle, then he'd be all over you like a green blow fly on a pile of manure!... everywhere at once!  Thanks for posting that Holdie!... it made me smile!"
426161,backbay,2010-01-27 01:17:00,773,"You seem like a good guy, but you're totally overshadowed by the company you keep, holdfast. Spike owns. Completely."
426179,bigugli,2010-01-27 02:05:00,6138,"Love that dog, Holdie. Of course, I love most rambunctious little dogs."
426209,douG,2010-01-27 03:08:00,2693," I guess that makes that pup a Regal, prince-like, if you will."
426574,splashhopper,2010-01-28 02:57:00,2931,Spike ROCKS!
