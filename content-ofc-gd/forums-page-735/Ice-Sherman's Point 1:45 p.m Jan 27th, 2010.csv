426507,bayboy,2010-01-28 00:50:00,16,"Took a run out to Sherman's this aft. Ice very bad. First 10-15' is broken ice and open water. Where there is ice it would be 2"" thick maximum. Very treacherous. Nobody out of course. Hard to see. Blowing snow, very cold. Could not see out to the Reach. Most of the time could not see the south shore across from Sherman's.  It would have been a good day to have a couple of ice huts on shore; all warmed up; and then we could have tested out our survival suits at the ramp, in controlled conditions. We would probably be surprised how clumsy we would be in cold, wet, survival suits, on floating ice blocks....Probably could have learned a lot if we were brave enough to do it. By the way, I have no intention of trying this!  Checked the weather report. Really cold night time temperatures coming, starting on Thursday.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0462  Stay safe.  bayboy"
