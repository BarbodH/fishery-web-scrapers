The education system for one really needs some work.  It doesn't take checking my papers to bust that guy over there for drinking."
426412,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-27 20:30:00,10439,"A friend of mine has a cottage in Sturgeon Falls and once called the ministry about an illegal net that was placed in front of his cottage. The ministry was going to give him the use of an IR video camera to gather evidence so that they could lay charges. Before he even got the camera from the ministry he was warned by some natives that it would not be a good idea and there might be repecussions involving his property and threats of a fire. He dropped the idea of gathering the evidence. The fishing has gone down hill in his area over the last 10 years. He also told me about meetings that the chief was involved in, and that the chief wanted to curtail netting to let the fishery recover. All were in agreement except the younger 20 somethings that continue to net illegally. It's sad as we used to be able to troll worm harnesses right out in front of his place and catch and release limit after limit of good eating sized eyes. Those days are gone unless things change sadly."
426462,sirfish,2010-01-27 22:45:00,175,"I,m glad this thread was resurected .I almost missed it. Interesting article. But these guys have nothing on the natives of Tyenindaga Quinte region. A couple of years back they ""harvested "" for native consumption and ceremonial purposes an estimated 125,000 lbs of walters. One neighbours son brought back a small freezer for his own native consuption and some friends also. Too bad a small group do ruin it for those that are truly trying to keep a native heritage alive. IMO"

426501,xeon,2010-01-28 00:38:00,350,"If they want special privileges then they shouldn't be allowed to use ANYTHING modern. Oh and those stocked walleye in Nipissing, ya about those, they belong to the tax payers, they are no longer the same fish your peoples once fished for, no touchy.  The rest of my rant would get the entire general discussion board locked."
426513,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-01-28 01:03:00,158,"First of all, we have to remember, they were here first and fisheries stocks collapsed because of the white man.  The first nations people were here harvesting fish for thousands of years with no problems before we showed up.  We are thes ones who unbalanced the great lakes, the east and west coast salmon and the Cod.  There have definately been some issues in the past, but over all the view of first nations has always been one of looking to the future.  This article is a good one in that it shows a example of how they are trying to play a responsible role in the stewrdship of fisheries stocks.  Many first nations in Canada are now taking much more active roles in monitoring and implementing of rules and regulations.  Just like us white folk, there are always a few bad apples that out there.  A good example of a successful and healthy first nations commercial fishery is the whitefish fishery in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.  They are clearly making an effort to work with the MNR and move forward, so should we."
426537,dickie,2010-01-28 01:39:00,64,"It wouldn""t be so bad if they used this commercial fishing to become self sufficient, but the sad fact of it all is they keep asking for more gov""t money all the time. HAVE ONE LAW FOR ALL PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND ALL YOUR PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED."

384201,Jonny,2009-09-17 14:21:00,1380,FYI  Article from today's North Bay Nugget...  http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1756643
384210,LucG,2009-09-17 14:35:00,779,Interesting read...  I wonder how many nets aren't a part of those statistics.
384219,Jonny,2009-09-17 14:55:00,1380,I don't think we really know that because the native fishery is self-policing. Hopefully that is working as it should.
384240,dheitzner,2009-09-17 15:30:00,314,"Interesting read, but these threads always end up the same way... "
384257,Fisherman,2009-09-17 16:13:00,7201,Kinda makes you wonder how a gill net puts back the slot size fish that the rest of us have to put back.
384262,LucG,2009-09-17 16:28:00,779,"Don't quote me on this, but I though the size of the gill nets pretty much catch all the slot sized fish. Smaller ones go through, and the bigger ones don't.  Again, I could be mis-informed.  Edit: Does anyones know if there is a set size for a gill net? Or do they vary?"
384266,Kinger,2009-09-17 16:33:00,351,Not touching this with a ten foot pole. I don't need to get enraged by clicking that link.
384268,Dara,2009-09-17 16:35:00,3052,I guess fishing for your own consumption means being able to sell them to buy beef as well eh
384270,bigfish1965,2009-09-17 16:47:00,3382,Well I don't fish Nippissing that often but have never had a problem finding walleye there. Can't be all that bad. So it at least appears that things are going well.
384271,Fishnwire,2009-09-17 16:49:00,983,"  Try to keep in mind that if non-natives didn't buy it, they'd have no one to sell it to.  What I'm saying is the people who create the market are part of the problem too.    You can almost hear the sound of the lock getting ready to clamp down this thread."
384272,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-17 16:50:00,1022,Filthy is the best way to describe this situation.
384278,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-17 17:02:00,0,"Commercial fishermen have always been able to do things that we cant. Like harvest fish in season and or out of season. That's where the commercial part comes from...lol If you think netting is easy and a great way to make some cash, think again., ITS WORK!! Enough said."
384292,Jonny,2009-09-17 17:28:00,1380," There are things you can do something about and some you can't. But at the very least you can stay informed.  A native fishery has a right to exist. How it is done, however,  is something that we need to engage in, and occasionally speak up about in a reasonable way.  There's no reason to get a topic like this locked as long as people don't get extreme. It doesn't do any of us, or the resource, any good to consider a subject like this somehow taboo. Remember - silence is taken as consent or agreement, or apathy.  To take one part of the article as an example... It is said that if the pickerel fishery improved from ""stressed"" to healthy, the netting harvest could be more. Well that's a thing that should be debated before it happens, because it should be balanced against things like narrowing the slot for sport fishermen.  Yes, netting (and cleaning) is not ""easy money"". It's money that takes work to bring in. It's work that has intrinsic value. And it's a lot better than government projects or handouts. (A principle that applies in ALL areas not just in this specific situation.)"
384298,Jonny,2009-09-17 17:38:00,1380,"I thought there might be some interest in having a look at a netting boat. Here's a photo I snapped last month. I ""grayed out"" the faces simply as a courtesy...  "
384308,Dara,2009-09-17 18:21:00,3052," Things were going pretty good with the cod fishery too.   A lot of the problem in our society is that ""it doesn't affect me so i'm having nothing to say about it"" and ""that affects me so I'm going to be really loud on this one"" . It all ends up special interest and somebody always gets screwed.  The government only listens to those who yell the loudest."
384311,Headhunter,2009-09-17 18:37:00,5703,"Having spoken to Bernie's Dad on this very subject, I would suggest that things are not a rosey as they may seem. I know that Bernie will not talk about this subject, but when I hear his Dad's story's about the past and his theories as to why we are where we are....I'll keep my mouth shut, so I don't lose posting privilages here. HH"
384324,kickingfrog,2009-09-17 19:39:00,8333," Gill nets do come in different sizes, and those sizes do allow you to target different sized fish."
384430,blarg,2009-09-18 01:38:00,289," But wait, you wouldn't be insinuating that those noble people would ever under report thier catch! /sacasm off  This liberal notion of the 'noble people' has got to stop, they are no different than you and I, and if you can't trust the average white guy to police his catch you can't trust them either, these could easily be the same people that will sell you cheap smokes, completely legal no doubt..o, they are better than us white folks all right.  Just like there were better out east when the courts affirmed thier rights to net atlantic salmon, and instead of doing that a group of them broke into a science station on a salmon ladder where the fish were trapped on thier way up river to be weighed and a scale sample taken, it wasn't enough to have free reign over the river, they needed to destroy equipment designed to improve knowledge and improve return rates of the fish, they were arrested eventually, after getting away scott free multiple times, the gov didn't want to open that can of worms, but had to eventually.  However on my last trip back to that river, long since the  reasearch has been stopped the fish are still being trapped in the ladder by someone, and what once was a beautiful spot both for the view and the fish has been turned into a trash infested booze camp by..someone..I have my views, but who knows, few white guys bother to go there any more, the fish counts are almost 0 now, and without a net or trapping them in a ladder desigend to make spawning easier there isn't much point to going fishing.   If you truly believe they know more about the fish/care more about the fish/are more environmentally concious etc then you or I, I suggest counselling, but seriously, this won't end well for nipissing.  It might easily have been the weather, but the fishing was quite poor this spring compared to last."
426361,crosshairs,2010-01-27 18:48:00,55,"That pic you have is actually the first nation's boat doing water samples, and patrolling for illegal shoreline work."
426378,Jonny,2010-01-27 19:15:00,1380,"Could be, but it's the same boat I have seen working nets farther out. We just don't usually get such a close look at it. Usually we watch it with binoculars."

426392,torco,2010-01-27 19:39:00,656,"This topic will probably go down the tubes pretty fast. But I see the value in a domestic fish market if done in an ethical and environmentally conscious way. I can't comment on the state of the commercial fishing practices on Nippissing but what I do know is if you have ever purchased any fish from your local grocery store you are likely supporting what is typically a terribly run industry. Many of the fish we enjoy from the store are not sustainable, are polluted, and create massive amounts of environmental pollution in getting to our table. So a domestic industry done with care could help in this respect.  It is up to the citizen as a consumer to be informed and make better choices. Not too mention we need to be vocal and steer our governments in the right direction.  Anyways I am probably preaching to the choir here as most of us as anglers and hunters understand conservation and harvest can be achieved with some common sense and balance."
426394,Terry,2010-01-27 19:43:00,14456,they have the legal right to do it  so    I will not judge.... as long as they do it within the law
426395,highdrifter,2010-01-27 19:43:00,2534, Prhaps they were doing Fall Walleye Index Netting??
426401,Big Cliff,2010-01-27 20:01:00,6899,We've been down this road before; don't judge all by the actions of a few.  If you have a problem with something that is going on then take it up with the proper authorities and try to get something done about it.  I find it kind of funny that people have a problem with the OPP doing a blitz and making sure that people are complying with the law and people are whining because some people are getting away with breaking the law and not getting caught.
