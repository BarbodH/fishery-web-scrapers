426021,Spiel,2010-01-26 17:38:00,9065, Not as well as I hoped to being doing at this point Jacques. I may have under estimated my ability to recover. Thank you for asking.
426065,Leecher,2010-01-26 20:26:00,7832," Sorry to hear the recovery is longer than you had anticipated Chris But on the bright side.... you got back into fly tying, keeps you busy for now and that's a good thing Thanks for the update and keep up the great work"
426123,Dusky,2010-01-26 23:30:00,310,Nice fish porn!! Must be fun pulling the golden girl:)
426152,Leecher,2010-01-27 00:46:00,7832, Thanks Dusky!!!  It was awesome to finally land one    and lots of fun
425410,Leecher,2010-01-24 21:00:00,7832,"Just got back from my golden mission and I'm happy to say that it was successfull....... Finally But first things first..... the details  LOL  At 6:15am, temperature was -10C with 13 Km wind from the east, windshield factor -15C     Not too bad LOL    Left home at 7:15am, made a pit stop to Tim for some hot refreshments..... one for the road and one for the thermos    Stop for gaz and the way I go.....  so I thought..... but not 10 minutes I'm driving and realize I forgot my insulated boots     So made a U turn and got back home to pick them up  Got to destination around 8:30am because of this and drove onto the ice, all the way out to my honey hole Drilled my first hole and ice was 13"" thick of the black stuff..... got 3 more done and setup 3 set lines with dead minnows and my jigging rod with a buck shot tipped with a minnow head.  Had a visit from 2 deers but was not fast enough with the cam to get a pic.  Here's my setup    Now for the fish porn LOL  First fish to hit the ice was a 10"" perch that I got on the jiggind rod..... totally swallowed the treble and the minnow head.   While I was taking care of my guest, I noticed my first set line going down.... ran to it and set the hook..... out comes a football size perch.  It measured 12"" square.  Here's a pic of both of them    I was pretty content in landing a couple but in the back of my mind ""GOLDEN"" was all I could think of At around 12:00pm, I was just about to call it a day when I see my first set line go down..... I ran to it and grab the line, felt the weight...... little head shakes.... oh it's just another perch so I thought    then this fish took a beeline and felt a lot heavier then a perch.  Pulled on the line and out came a 17.5"" golden surprise    Man was I ever happy to see it    That right there made my trip worth while.  Then after that got a few hits and miss.... was expecting another golden to show up but never did..... at 1:00pm called it a day.  Here are my guests for the pan tonight.... All fish were CP but not R LOL    All in all was great to be out on the hard stuff. Hope you enjoy Leechman"
425413,MCTFisher9120,2010-01-24 21:18:00,3761,"Nice job man! I'll have to look into that style of tip-up you are using. What line do you string on them, I know I bought one and it had this black thick braid on it...I put a small 2-3ft Fluoro leader onto it...hope it works ok  Can't beat catching a 12""+ Perch man! Good Job.  MTBF"
425419,Leecher,2010-01-24 21:32:00,7832," Thanks Mike!!! Those tipups are the ones I made my self..... they are really sensitive.... only takes little wind to make them tip.  I use the 30# black stuff they sell at CTC.  I add a 5"" wire leader and above that a bell sinker.  To that I add a #3 Octupus hook.   I could go with fluro leaders but so far the eyes don't seemed to mind too much  Did not get into many today but I sure got some quality ones Thanks again Mike and tight lines Leechman"
425420,Terry,2010-01-24 21:34:00,14456,nice going  nice tip ups too
425422,Leecher,2010-01-24 21:38:00,7832,Thanks Terry!!!
425432,Greencoachdog,2010-01-24 22:07:00,8163,"Congratulations on a successful trip Jacques!!!  Those are all real nice looking fish!!!  You were using one more line than I'm allowed to when I fish Neely Henry, that doesn't happen very often in Canada."
425440,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-24 22:27:00,2038,"Hey nice going Jacques ....  Last night I was thinking about the three of us hitting that lake early this morning , then heading a little further north for some whities ...Several hours later I woke up on the couch ..hockey game was long over..   Remember were heading to the Bay of Quinte soon...."
425444,splashhopper,2010-01-24 22:37:00,2931,AS a newbie to ice fishing.... i was under the impression that I could only have two lines in the water at any given time?  Am I mistaken?   Nice looking fish btw...
425445,Greencoachdog,2010-01-24 22:40:00,8163,  Not if you live and fish in Quebec!
425447,Leecher,2010-01-24 22:50:00,7832," Thanks Glen!!!  Not many today but quality for sure    Actually I could of used another line, I'm allowed    and that would of made a couple more but that right there is sufficient for me It only happens all winter long   Thanks Paul!!!  Last night I had a dream of hooking into a monster golden but alas got brutality awaken to the alarm clock at 6:00am I'm planning on going again next weekend..... got plenty of golden shinners left.... they're going into a bath of pickling salt and then into a very cold environment  Let me know the details for Quinte..... wouldn't miss it for the world"
425451,Leecher,2010-01-24 23:00:00,7832, Thanks splashhopper!!!  You are not mistaken.... like GCD said only if you're fishing in Qu√©bec.... up here we are allowed 5 lines on hard water
425524,bigugli,2010-01-25 02:47:00,6138,Good to see a successful outing Jacques.
425544,Leecher,2010-01-25 03:30:00,7832, Thanks Bruce!!!  Sure feels good to finally land one
425598,corvette1,2010-01-25 13:06:00,1765,way to go leech have a good fry
425599,Beans,2010-01-25 13:26:00,3339, Some lakes in Ontario call for ice fishing with one line only...Check the exceptions in the regulations...
425600,splashhopper,2010-01-25 13:29:00,2931,"  No matter how many lines I can put in the Quebec water, i am still not moving to that country."
425601,splashhopper,2010-01-25 13:30:00,2931, Thanks for the reminder Beans.
425625,Fish Farmer,2010-01-25 14:45:00,2234,"Fresh northern Walleye, can't bet that. Nice pictures Thanks for posting."
425729,Leecher,2010-01-25 20:31:00,7832, Thanks corvy!!!  They were real good cooked in butter and served with a ceasar salad   Ohhhh did not know this..... thanks Beans for the info   Are you sure?  Some parts of Montreal area you can have up to 10 lines out   Thanks Fish Farmer!!!  Can't have it any fresher than that
425751,Whitespinnerbait,2010-01-25 21:33:00,2038,  I don't blame ya..
425819,Fishing 24/7,2010-01-26 00:09:00,709,HOT DIIGIDY DOG SMACK DOWN STRAIGHT IN THE MIDLLE BOO YAH OMG CONGRATS !
425932,Spiel,2010-01-26 12:04:00,9065,"You could have lost that ""Golden"" Jacques and you'd still be having a better ice season than me.  However you didn't and that obviously made for a fine meal."
425995,Leecher,2010-01-26 16:01:00,7832, Thanks Kev!!!   Thanks Chris!!!  Haven't had a good feed like this since last September..... hopefully I can get some more next weekend How are you doing with your recovery?
426002,MJL,2010-01-26 16:22:00,2427,"Nicely done Jacques...Great tips for sure.  I actually just started getting into ice fishing (I've been out a total of 3 times in my life).  Lots to learn.  You ever think about making a jigging plug like the Rapala one...I imagine with your craftsmanship, and Busharts mad painting skills you could produce a weapon of mass fishing destruction"
426011,Leecher,2010-01-26 16:43:00,7832, Thanks Mike!!!  I'm happy to hear that you are getting into hard water fishing....  lots of fun and different from softwater.  Were you able to land a few the times you were out?  As for jigging plug.... i'd love to create my own jigs but would require additional tools for that and yeah Bushart's painting skills  certainly is top notch.... incredible Thanks again Mike and good luck out there!!!
