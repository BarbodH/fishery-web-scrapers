426087,icefisherman,2010-01-26 22:07:00,952,"OK,  one more report to file from today. The usual suspects were on hand for another great Simcoe day.Started 7am and were fishing by 7:45am....got my limit of whities by 9:30am but the lakers were tough. Meegs did all the damage today.... had a minnow line for a change as well......but nada there.....was hoping for some huge laker but maybe next time....checked all the way down to 110 fow but not much luck there. Finally managed to fish together with Crappieperchhunter for the Simcoe big guys/girls....thanks for the great company Steve,we'll do it again....I think you are hook for good now ha ha ha Tough day today as we didn't mark many fish so the goal was to catch most of what we've marked.It worked....  Here is a shot of the day:   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

And double thx for the supply of Meegs. I promise to put them to good use.   Did I already mention that the laker in Emils picture was mine...and that it was my first one through the ice in almost 30 years
