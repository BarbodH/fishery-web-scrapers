425717,rangervs,2010-01-25 20:08:00,7,"Stayed at Sandy Bay lake nipissing with Jeff. Excellent operator, moved us around without us asking. Very friendly service. Drilled holes for us in the right locations. His knowledge of the lake was the key factor in making our weekend successful. We were on perch all day with approx. hundred released mixed with herring and walleye.  Moved up on the shoals in the evenings for Walleye. Had loads of fun.  Here are a few pics of our catch.   "
