425857,walleyejack,2010-01-26 02:15:00,358,"Anyone have an idea what a 1980's Honda 9.9 long shaft might be worth ? If anything, I have been offered one as I am looking for a kicker, but i think it is overpriced for the year and he tells me it has not run in 5 yrs. but is in good condition, any thoughts would be appreciated."
425866,trevy727,2010-01-26 02:40:00,351,a 1985 honda 9.9 longshaft in good condition can go from $800.00-$950.00. They are great motors and last for ever

425927,vinnimon,2010-01-26 11:04:00,2593,I recently picked up an 85 4stroke honda 7.5 hp for $800.In excelent running condition tank and hose included.
426268,siwash,2010-01-27 09:30:00,683,I paid 475 and it runs fantastic... I would not pay 800
426281,Big Cliff,2010-01-27 12:49:00,6899,"I wouldn't be paying $800.00 for it either. If it hasn't been run in 5 years I'd be wanting to check it out very carefully. Seals could be dried out, I'd replace the impeller, and service the fuel system. I might pay $500.00 for it if it is nice and clean and doesn't show any sign of physical damage."
