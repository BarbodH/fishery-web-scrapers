424479,TJQ,2010-01-21 15:17:00,7806,"The coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs decided to send the team on a fishing trip together to build team spirit.  Since none of them have ever had time to go fishing before, they had no fishing equipment. So the coach gives them $1000 and sends them to Bass Pro Shops with a list of fishing equipment to buy.  The Maple Leafs get off the bus and walk into Bass Pro Shop while the coach stays back in the bus to go over some details for the next game.  An hour later the coach looks at his watch and thinks, these guys must be really picky about what they are buying. That's great for building thinking skills he says to himself.  An hour later, the coach looks at his watch and thinks, they must be having a good time. That's great for building team spirit he says to himself.  An hour later the coach looks at his watch and thinks, I bet those guys found a bar and are having a beer. That's great for building team friendship he says to himself.  An hour later the coach looks at his watch and thinks, what the hell is wrong. I better go into the store and see what's happening.  The coach walks into Bass Pro and stands at the front door. He sees his team frantically running around the store. After about 15 minutes he shouts THAT'S ENOUGH !!!!   WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS DOING!!!!  With all their heads down the Toronto Maple Leafs slowly walk towards the coach until they are all standing in a group. Matt Stajan walks out of the group with his head down and hands the coach the list of equipment. Matt looks at the coach and says ""sorry coach"". ""We went through the whole list and bought all the items except the last one on the list. No-matter how hard we all looked, we could not find the net."""

424534,tightline,2010-01-21 17:30:00,322,Being a Leafs fan that one hurt!! But reminded me of another (like there isn't enough) Leafs joke:  What do the Leafs and the Titanic have in common....they both look great until they hit the ice!!!
424538,dave524,2010-01-21 17:40:00,4508,"In defense of the Leafs, they actually have one of the higher shots on goal totals in the league, quite often in a losing effort they have outshot the opposition, finding the back of the net and keeping it out of their net is another thing"

424560,trevy727,2010-01-21 19:36:00,351,Shots on goal and shots at the goalie should be 2 different catagories.  what does a cigarette machine have that the leafs don't? players.  what do the canadians and rangers have that the leafs don't? colored pictures of the stanley cup
