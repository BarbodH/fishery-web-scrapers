426226,cram,2010-01-27 03:35:00,1733,Why walk around with that much cash anyway?  Just do a bank draft or certified cheque.   You don't want to pay an inflated price because they have to pass 2% on to visa.

426312,ohhenrygsr,2010-01-27 15:08:00,947, Yea it's crazy what the credit card companies are charging for a consumer to buy a product these days.    I use to work at a casino and if you went over $9999.99 you automatically get entered into the FinTrac system for a LCTR (large Cash Transaction Record) There's also a LCDR (large Cash Dispersement Record)  Both you might get questioned later in Life by our awesome Gov't.  They also keep track of transactions of $2500 or more so if it does add up to more then $9999.99 you still get entered into Fintrac.  Opps i think i wasn't suppose to talk about that lol
426320,torco,2010-01-27 15:55:00,656,"I could see the 2% on the purchase being an issue if you are apparently making $1000 profit on the sale as once the sales person gets his portion it doesn't leave much of a margin for the dealer. I hate dealing with the Dealer, especially for new vehicles. As far as dealerships go from a sales function there is almost no value add in the sale process to me since I can find all the info I need online.  Car companies really need to rethink the sales channel for selling vehicles which could arguably lower prices for consumers and improve profit margins for the manufacturer. You can buy just about everything else in the world at Wal-mart why not cars?  I'm just throwing out hypothetical's here..."
426325,Fish4Eyes,2010-01-27 16:26:00,1022,"You wont get them to budge much to be honest with you. The most they will budge is MAYBE 1000$.  Your best bet is to say ""This is my offer, I will leave my number with you and incase you change your mind you can give me a call"". Your dreaming if you think they will take an offer like yours which is considerably less. You need to find yourself a private sale, and then wave the certified cheque in their face. Works much better in that scenario."

Invoice price, MSRP etc... are misleading because dealers get breaks if they sell so many cars they get a couple of free ones.... Pretty much all retailers play that game now. Dealer list is meaningless. As a financial advisor, I'm obligated to report any suspicious transactions to FINTRAC. I can't take cash now even though it is Legal Tender with the new money laundering rules. Big brother is watching....... I think the ultimate goal is to eliminate paper money ie.cash and make everything electronic so the government can make sure they get their cut on every single transaction made and to eliminate money laundering for terrorist groups and the like."
426339,fishnsled,2010-01-27 17:16:00,3520,"Well I'm no expert on this but here's what I know from my last 2 trucks.  My previous truck was bought through a dealership that my buddy works at.  Was told the best price was $14,000, uncertified.  My buddy did the safety and all was fine.  Found out later that the guy who traded it in was given $9000 for the trade in.  $5000 in profits less whatever administation cost were involved. I probably paid for them on top of the costs anyways.  My next truck was on a lot for $22,900 I told them $17000 was all I had.  After some dealing I was out the door for $17500 taxes in and a bedliner, fiberglass flat top, hitch and wiring.  Thought I had a pretty good deal until my insurance came in a couple months later and showed the value of the truck at $12,900.  So if I was in an accident that was a write off I'd be out almost 5G's in a couple months of ownership.  Personally I wouldn't by the Bull from some of these dealerships, the insurance companies are a whole other story.  From my experences there is a lot more room to play with if they want to.  Just find a dealer that wants to play.  Can you imagine going and droping $25G's to find out in a couple of months the truck is only worth 1/2  . I'm glad that guy wasn't me, only a 1/3 less in value of what I paid  .  I guess they deserve the name Stealerships that I've heard so many call them."
426344,JohnF,2010-01-27 17:41:00,3494,"This is the joy of the free enterprise system.  The retailer is entitled to ask whatever they want.  The consumer is entitled to say no and shop around for a better price.  In most situations like this there is no obligation on the part of either participant to do the deal until they have signed a mutually agreed set of terms.  So, If you don't like the retailer's terms, go elsewhere.  But if that retailer has a unique product (i.e. one you can't live without) then you'd better be prepared to pay a premium.  They call it supply and demand economics.  JF"
426345,johnnyb,2010-01-27 17:45:00,3413,"In my last 7 years selling vehicles at the dealership I work at, this is what I've learned: - With every ad in the newspaper at dealer cost, there is little to no room for negotiating on a new vehicle - Financing is more attractive to the dealership (not the salesperson though) than cash, but it's rarely a bargaining chip either way - More profit is made on used cars, but the bulk of a dealership's revenue comes from the service dept. - If I don't make a commission, I don't get paid...selling ten cars a month for the minimum commission of $150 or $200 isn't going to pay the bills.  So not every offer is acceptable. -****car cost Canada is a waste of time and money.  Anyone can walk in to my office and ask to see the cost of any of our vehicles...there's nothing to hide. - there are a ridiculous amount of dishonest/unscrupulous dealers/salespeople out there..I truly don't know how they stay in business.  But there ARE some good guys."

If I sell you something that I make no money on, why would I sell it to you? If the car has 11K's and has been through no accidents, the resale value is high, thus no need to accept low-ball offers, it will move fast. A potential win for the dealership."
426132,craigdritchie,2010-01-26 23:49:00,1586,"Roy hit the nail squarely on the head. The dealer makes squat on the vehicle itself. The profit comes primarily from financing and surcharges, especially in the case of pre-owned.  Other major sources of profit include: • Service packages • Rustproofing • Interior treatments (Scotchguarding, etc) • Extended warranties • Optional dealer-installed accessories • Life insurance on your loan/lease • Trade-in valuations • After-sale service (oil changes etc)  They will pitch all of these things to you as you write up the paperwork with the business manager (English translation - best salesperson in the shop). You can't buy a vehicle without having all these things pushed on you. Most represent pure profit for the dealer."

426155,FUSION,2010-01-27 00:56:00,81," Louis, the number they are looking for is $26,400 for the Truck. Anything over that is gravy and anything under is cutting into sales commision and dealer profit. You have to remember sales commision and dealer profit are two different things. If you really want the truck go in with a certified check made out to the dealership for said ammount and you will be driving home in it the same day. The margin for ""negotiation"" these days is not what it used to be, especially on used at a major dealership."
