426712,Steel28,2010-01-28 14:41:00,160,Looking to buy a new hunting jacket and pants (prefer bibs style). Does anyone have any recommendations on what they prefer? Hoping to get some gortex.  I will be using it in the winter as well as during turkey hunts in spring/fall.  thanks

I have a River's West Jacket right now.  It's alright.  Not as warm as I thought so I have to double up making it very bulky.  A new Browning is on the wish list, just have to wear out this one first...."
