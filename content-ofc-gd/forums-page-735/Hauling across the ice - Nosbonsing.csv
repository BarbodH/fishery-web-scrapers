We were up Jan 15 - 17 to check it out and do some ice fishing.  small perch and 1 - 17"" pickerel (both on minnow and a hook).  Ice only seemed about 12"" thick with 4"" of water under a couple of inches of snow.  spent more time trying to stay out of the water and getting dry than fishing!anyway, we are looking to build a dock (floating) and I would like to build it on the ice now and let it settle and haul it to where it needs to go in spring.  My question is - what are the ice conditions now?  is there anything/area I should avoid?  I would be entering soemwhere in bondfield and heading over to the south shore.  I am just south of the sunken island (i think).  Iwould have my gm ext cab 6l with a two axle trailer full of lumber.  I saw lots of trucks and cars out when I was there last but I just want to make sure its safe for a bit more weight than a standard vehicle.  any suggestions/ comments would be great Thanks!tried to post a pic of the ice but cant seem to do it.  It says its uploading but then nothing happens and it still says 0 attachments"

425780,Bernie,2010-01-25 22:09:00,3190,I hear there is about a foot of ice. May have lost some in the last day or two though. And the rain runoff will erode some in certain places too. Don't think I would be heading out on it with a load just yet.
426163,woodee148,2010-01-27 01:29:00,14,Thanks Bernie!  I think you answered one of my questions on another site a few days ago..re:  Dock!!  I will wiat and see as we are not going up till end of Feb now. Hoping the ice is good enough then.  It would be a long hike with enough lumber for 12' x 36' dock along with 27  -  55 gallon drums lol  
426560,woodee148,2010-01-28 02:28:00,14,just a little bump to see if anyone from nosbonsing is around yet.....
426601,skeeter,2010-01-28 04:14:00,1907,just fill the drums with helium and your good to go......  just dont inhale the helium when your building the dock or you will do a mickey mouse job on it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     sorry i couldnt resist
