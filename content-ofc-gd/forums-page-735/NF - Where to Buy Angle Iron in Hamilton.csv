426769,boatman,2010-01-28 17:21:00,350,"I'm building a couple small trailers to tow behind snowmobiles for some friends. I built one last year from some scrap metal at work, but I don't have access to the amount of steel I need for the project and Princess Auto is too expensive.  I need about 100 feet of 1"" angle iron. I'm also looking for reasonably priced used snowmobile skis if anyone knows where to find some."

426837,boatman,2010-01-28 20:34:00,350," That's right. I know where they make it, but not where they sell it.  I normally buy steel at Princess Auto because its convenient, but its just too expensive to buy this amount of steel there."
426839,Dara,2010-01-28 20:45:00,3052,How quick do you need it. I buy from all the warehouses but I'm going away next week and can't arrange for anything that fast. Go to a steel fabricator and ask them. 1x1x1/8 should be around a buck a foot
