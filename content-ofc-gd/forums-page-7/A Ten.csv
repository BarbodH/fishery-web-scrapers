1082743,Snakecharmer,2022-11-04 21:43:00,30,What a fish!
1082748,CrowMan,2022-11-04 23:32:00,413,My buddy and I got a few 5lb fish today...small inland lake. Hard to see how that one is twice the size...

1082779,OhioFisherman,2022-11-07 03:33:00,6623,""" The Ohio smallmouth record is held by Randy VanDam, who caught a 9.5-pounder out of Lake Erie in June of 1993. "" LOL, after 30? years of eating gobies they are getting bigger? There may have been a chance for a 10 pound spotted bass if they had added them instead of Coho?"
1082785,glen,2022-11-07 13:33:00,2641,I guess when the weather is good for small mouth they grow bigger. Longer growing season.   	what a great fish.  Maybe someone can beat it on simcoe.
1082786,CrowMan,2022-11-07 13:42:00,413,"I'd put my money on eastern Lake O for the next record Smallmouth. Between the Gobies, Alewife and Gizzard Shad they just keep getting bigger every year. This spring, during the new C&R season, the number of big tanks we hooked was incredible."
1082790,AKRISONER,2022-11-07 18:39:00,5558,"the pre-spawn reg unfortunately makes it impossible to break the record. You aren't even allowed to weigh the fish in your boat never mind get it certified.  With the amount of 8's that people catch these days its no surprise someone finally hit a DD.  Im fairly sure Nick Cousivs caught a 9+lber a couple of years back on Lake O, he simply has the go pro footage and released it in alignment with the regs."
