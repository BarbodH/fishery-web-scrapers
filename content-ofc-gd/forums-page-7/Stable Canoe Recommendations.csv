I am looking to upgrade now, likely to a 14' Sportspal, and hopefully it will have a keel as my 12 footer does not. THAT makes it super annoying to paddle in anything other than zero breeze. I almost always use a 40lb Minn Kota, though, and it's decent (but still requires constant adjustment to keep straight).  There is another company in the US that makes ""Sportspal"" canoes that look similar, but are not related at all. Meyer or Meyers I think they're called."

Great for wind blown lakes but a bear for river paddling.¬† 	it works great with a troller but see above again about paddling. Unsinkable with chambers and sponsons and stable enough to stand in, even in mild river current. if I bought another canoe, it would be a more efficient paddling model that is portage capable (under 50lbs) and not a square stern. I think I‚Äôd prefer to mount the electric troller on a side mount as the tiller handle isn‚Äôt right behind your back. If I ran a gas tiller, id still opt for a square stern however (over fears of losing an expensive motor on a side bracket) "
1082094,Samjo,2022-09-14 15:18:00,1,You will not go wrong with a Sportspal....Best canoe going and the most stable... I have paddled hundreds of miles in one and I even tried to sink it but could not... As long as you take care of them they will last forever    
711168,kickingfrog,2012-07-03 16:34:00,8333,You can get a 12 footer that weighs 50lbs and you can get a 16 footer that weighs less then 40lbs. Materials and technic are more important then length.
711182,rufus,2012-07-03 17:22:00,267,She doesn't want a 16 ft. Probably a 14 ft is as big as she will go.
711204,scugpg,2012-07-03 17:50:00,1373," The full transom model takes considerable effort to paddle, but doable. much nicer with a small electric or gas on there. The 14ft sportspal full transom can also hold a 3hp motor."
711208,jedimaster,2012-07-03 17:55:00,3472,Stable means a brick for paddling... weigh out your decision carefully. Just wear a lifejacket and go for speed.
711210,woodenboater,2012-07-03 17:58:00,2277,"So she's comfortable paddling solo then I take it. A short canoe is going to require some skills to keep tracking straight but will be a joy to paddle heeled over to the gunwale. Should be a few choices out there, depending on $$."
711231,rufus,2012-07-03 19:06:00,267, Maybe a short Sportspal that paddles like a scow may not be a bad thing for her as it would be easier to keep straight.
711291,kickingfrog,2012-07-03 21:04:00,8333,"Longer canoes generally are easier to keep straight, but if you don't know how to paddle then it is likely to make very little difference."

I'm a canoe snob so don't think sponsons are good for learning how to keep the open side up  They have their uses though so won't discount that."

Find a place she can 'test drive' a good 14 footer. If she needs light, buy kevlar. It costs but it will give her a more usable and pleasurable canoe.   "

My brother, who I consider the biggest canoe snob, owns a chestnut prospector (which I've used throughout my years) and even HE admitted that my sportspal isn't all that bad. Infact, when paddling in pairs, me and Sarah can actually keep up to him when he's got a partner.  now if your paddling solo, STAY AWAY from sportspal, it's like paddling a bar of soap, especially in the wind. I put rocks at the front just to keep it semi-straight.  Clearly I'm biased, as I own and love my sporty!"

711503,solopaddler,2012-07-04 09:25:00,8605, If you're anywhere near Atikokan call Canoe Canada Outfitters. From time to time they sell off their rental boats at a huge discount.  I know for a fact that they recently had a couple of ultralight kevlar Swift Cruisers for sale for around $600. That's a design based on the time tested Sawyer Cruiser which was a staple for many many years.  Brand new that boat is well over 3 grand.

Not a pissing match, was just wondering if you guys are talking the sportspal from US or Radisson from Canada.

712164,doack,2012-07-06 13:12:00,46,"Thanks Rodcaster, is the Radisson made in same plant in North Bay, or is it a sister company somewhere else? And is it the same exact canoe, or is there a difference between Radisson and Sportspal?"

481080,NAW,2010-06-30 03:18:00,4022,"sportspals are great canoes.  They have this foam floats running down each side, and a good shape, which make them very stable.  I own a very old aluminum springbok that has a very stable shape to it.  The sides bulge out and make it very wide, similar to the effect given by the foam supports on the sportspals.  I used to run a 4hp motor off the side of my canoe.  I could sit in the canoe sideways, and lean back on the motor with my feet up on the opposite gunwale, and the cane wouldn't come close to tipping.  I can pretty well stand up on one gunwale, and the canoe will not flip.  It's the most stable canoe I've ever been in.  My dad bought it when we lived in Pickle Lake to run the river up there. It's also very long, and good for loading up, or taking the family out in.  I'm not saying all springboks are very stable canoes, but this paticular model ranks up there with the best of them. "
481115,Bob,2010-06-30 12:23:00,370,"Sportspals are lightweight and stable and fairly easy to repair with aluminum sheet and pop rivets.  If you hang a motor on them, they're wonderful but if you plan to use paddle power, they're terrible. That's why they build them with oarlocks. I used to build them many years ago.  If you enjoy paddling, get a real canoe."
481120,troutologist,2010-06-30 12:42:00,951,"any boat with a flat bottom will be stable, if you plan on some shallow water and rock sliding on the grand an abs or roylex boat will be best.  Read up on initial vs secondary stability and see what is best for your situation.  I believe there is a demo day on guelph lake, you can test out a few models to see what you like."

Can Stand and cast (or drain a coffee), stretch out and flat line, or paddle across a lake in no time at all.

Do you referring to square stern models or all Sportspals? (Square stern canoes all have the same issue of not paddling well).

711119,woodenboater,2012-07-03 13:36:00,2277,"Might be an old thread but still worth updating.  Agree about being aware about initial vs secondary stability. I'd go with secondary every time.  Flat bottoms, while they may feel very secure to those not super comfortable in canoes, will not have the stability when things get anywhere near rough. It's either stable or not. Rounded v or shallow arched bottoms will feel tippier or less stable initially, but will, when the chips are down, be safer imo (assuming one does not grab the gunwales). It will roll, if you will, with the waves and water whereas a flat bottom will not.  Get used to the shallow arch, stay loose in the hips and you won't miss the flat bottom.  Also agree with going to demo days to try different canoes and designs."
