1082187,OhioFisherman,2022-09-20 20:25:00,6623,"LOL, interesting at least, we had no clue what he had hooked, and it wasn't in much of a hurry to come up and show us, never knew they got that big back then."
1082195,Snidley,2022-09-21 15:18:00,620,I love catching them They fight really well. Sometimes you see them with their head buried into the bottom in springtime. When they are in that position it usually indicates that they have found a nest of fish eggs and are chowing down on it. Lots of fishermen hate them because they do eat fish eggs but that's part of nature imo. I caught one once that was bright chartreuse on its underside. Looked like a cartoon fish.
1082207,John Bacon,2022-09-22 03:41:00,3277,Spawning male bowfin often have a lot of green on them.
1082209,AKRISONER,2022-09-22 10:10:00,5558,Used to catch ‘em froggin in the pads a lot. When you get a big one you think you’ve caught your PB largemouth
1082139,16 Footer,2022-09-18 14:26:00,191,"My son caught a bowfin in a shallow weedy lake north of Orillia. I have never seem one and did not know they existed in Ontario. The fish was re least. The bowfin  has existed since primordial times. It is part of the Amiidae family and is the only living representative of the order Amiiformes, which is traced back to Jurassic times. Bowfin fish are often referred to as a “living fossil.” "
1082140,crappieperchhunter,2022-09-18 14:49:00,2582,When my son was little I took him to a spot near Orillia on Simcoe where we caught catfish in the spring. One day walking the bank of the creek  I saw a bowfin...didn't know what it was then either... sunning itself right beside the bank in 1-2 feet of water. Took a fishing rod rigged with a worm and dangled it right on the bowfins nose. Well he inhaled it and I handed the rod to my son for him to enjoy the fight. He enjoyed it so much we pretty much stopped fishing for catfish and just walked the bank sight fishing bowfin. Until the water warmed up and the bowfins disappeared we where there every spring.
1082141,Podric,2022-09-18 14:50:00,46,Yep.   I have caught 2.  A giant claw through the head is the only thing a bowfin understands.
1082142,Beans,2022-09-18 15:26:00,3339,Just as I never knew Crappie were called Crappie until I saw a picture in a magazine...We were told they were Calico Bass...Bowfin we were told were Dogfish or Burbot or Ling...
1082143,TJQ,2022-09-18 15:51:00,7806,Uhhg  ...  it aint pretty!
1082144,AKRISONER,2022-09-19 12:04:00,5558,Are you saying that when you catch them you kill them?
1082145,Podric,2022-09-19 12:07:00,46,Look at the picture in the original post.
1082146,AKRISONER,2022-09-19 12:19:00,5558,"Exactly my question…you are either encouraging the behaviour? Or are being sarcastic, which unfortunately does not translate over plain text. may want to clarify with an emoji? Or leave it as is if you want it interpreted the same way I did."
1082147,Podric,2022-09-19 12:23:00,46,What high school are you teaching at today?
1082148,glen,2022-09-19 12:32:00,2641,The gaff type holder used in the picture may be as harmless as a finger in the gill plate.
1082149,AKRISONER,2022-09-19 13:04:00,5558,"man, for a guy with 39 posts to your credit, you sure have a way of going about things. Lets not let this thread get locked as well."
1082150,Terry,2022-09-19 13:46:00,14456,Yeah I can’t tell if it is dead or being gently held with a gaff as to not have to touch the ugly thing
1082151,Podric,2022-09-19 13:47:00,46,OK Bossman.
1082152,Podric,2022-09-19 13:50:00,46,Super tough and belligerent boat companion.  They don't like complying.
1082153,CrowMan,2022-09-19 14:01:00,413,"Just to clarify...Bowfin and Burbot are completely different species. Bowfin are a warm water fish usually found in shallow weedy water, while Burbot are cold water fish usually found deep. Yes, Bowfin are commonly called Dogfish, and Burbot are called a number of names depending on the region...Ling, Eelpout, Lawyerfish. Burbot are great eating...they're also known as ""Freshwater Cod""...sweet, white flaky meat. I often catch them incidently ice fishing for Walleye or Lake Trout/Whitefish...they make for a delicious meal of fish and chips. "
1082154,Beans,2022-09-19 14:16:00,3339,"Many moons ago, ice fishing on Lake Simcoe most people left them on the ice for the farmer that raised mink in the area...I only tried eating one once...was like chewing on rubber...LOL"
1082155,CrowMan,2022-09-19 14:36:00,413,"Lol....not sure how you cooked it, but I'm not the only one who likes them...this is c&p from Tastilicious: The burbot is a white fish with a mild flavor and a subtle sweet undertone, resembling haddock or cod. Its texture is firm and buttery with tender white flakes. Burbots don’t have any bones, which makes eating them easier and more enjoyable. It is an excellent fish for kids thanks to its combination of mild flavor and boneless meat."
1082156,Podric,2022-09-19 15:12:00,46,"The one in the original picture is a bowfin though???  Beady eyes, strips on the tale, short snout, stubby enough tale. ?????????? "
1082157,CrowMan,2022-09-19 15:38:00,413,"Yes, original photo is a Bowfin. I just wanted to clarify the different species, as one of the posts stated: ""Bowfin we were told were Dogfish or Burbot or Ling...""  "
1082158,Terry,2022-09-19 15:54:00,14456,"And you stated so, it was not ambiguous at all"
1082159,16 Footer,2022-09-19 16:48:00,191,The plastic gaff (not sharp) was used to hold the bowfin because of sharp teeth. It was released back into the lake. 
1082165,Beans,2022-09-19 20:36:00,3339,The one I caught in Frenchman's Bay near the little bridge in open water was a more greenier color...The ling I ate was from Lady Simcoe... I was told it was like poor man's lobster so I gave it a try...can't remember if I cooked it or my first wife R.I.P.
1082166,BillM,2022-09-19 20:47:00,17367,"Find the nastiest, shallow water and you'll find these critters.   I always think I've got a monster largie on until I get a look."
1082169,OhioFisherman,2022-09-19 22:33:00,6623,"Over the years we caught a few of them at Pointe Au Baril, all except 1 were caught in shallow weedy areas and were 6-8 pounds. One of my buddies got 1 in 16 - 18 feet of water that was pushing 20 pounds, it was a tank!"
1082178,BillM,2022-09-20 16:23:00,17367,That must have been one hell of a fight.
