1081978,BillM,2022-09-03 13:48:00,17367,"Decided to take a personal day and fish the Kawarthas with a buddy that hasn't been out on the water for years..  Water temps were perfect (low 70's) and the fish were eating.   Tied my PB day with 6 muskies in the boat, 3 came unbuttoned...  Capped it off with this fat 44 incher that followed earlier in the day but didn't commit.

1081980,lew,2022-09-03 14:22:00,12766,"Good stuff Bill, the K Lakes are a fun place to fish for sure."
1081981,BillM,2022-09-03 19:24:00,17367,Thanks Lew.  It's a nice confidence boost when fish are few and far between in my home waters of Gbay.   Off next week to Nipissing to put the hurt on some big girls!
1081982,lew,2022-09-03 19:48:00,12766,"My buds been up at the West Arm of Nip this week and he boated 5 nice ones from mid 40's up to 52"""
1081984,gordy28,2022-09-03 19:52:00,638,Nice musky!    So clean and chunky Andrew
1081985,Reef Runner,2022-09-03 21:16:00,980,Beauty!
1081988,AKRISONER,2022-09-04 11:52:00,5558,It’s almost like people have given up on pigeon lake…just an observation but I see so few people fishing it for musky compared to a few years back…I’m not sure why the tri lakes are loaded with skis! I seem to hook or catch one every trip there bass fishing these days!
1081999,BillM,2022-09-04 23:17:00,17367,The only lake I really wouldn't be fishing muskie in is Balsam.   Pike are really taking a strong hold in there.  We usually fish Pigeon on opener.
1082000,Rizzo,2022-09-05 00:56:00,4754,nice fish. I am about to start my musky season as well! Excited for the next few months
1082001,Hank Jr,2022-09-05 14:39:00,146,Nice day on the water . With the water cooling down the Muskie fishing will pick up .
1082009,Rustic-Fisher,2022-09-05 20:55:00,826,"NICE !!!!! Kids back in school , boat fixed , cool weather … its go time !!!!"
1082011,captpierre,2022-09-06 01:41:00,2521,Still lots of guys fishing musky on north Pigeon. I usually catch 4~5 per season ripping bucktails for eyes. Only one so far this year.
1082012,Freshtrax,2022-09-06 03:17:00,2215,Nice... its pretty much the only fish in ontairo I have never boated.   Going to have to give it an honest go one of these times.
1082027,Rizzo,2022-09-07 22:43:00,4754,"well I got my season started. Went to Pigeon yesterday and boated 2 lost a 3rd. Nothing huge, but you don't want to start off too hot anyways. Decent day but still lots of room for improvement. Water in am was 69 by the afternoon was 71"
1082071,BillM,2022-09-11 15:38:00,17367,"I just got back from up north.  Had a good few days.   Trolling bite was on, I lost a giant on a figure 8, buddy couldn't get the net in the water in time.  Also had an even bigger fish roll a Suick, come back on it and miss it again.   Solid 50in, then 10 mins later the wind dies and the bite stops for the rest of the day. This fish came in at 46, heaviest muskie I've ever held.   Super thick everywhere, made that Kawartha fish look like a baby.     "

1082082,Weeds,2022-09-12 17:45:00,782,"Beauty. That’s one well fed, healthy looking fish."
