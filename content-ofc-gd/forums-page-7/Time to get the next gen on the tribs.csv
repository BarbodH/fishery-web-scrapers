Dad and son have have been having a great re bonding. Brings joy to my heart. He will grow into the new stick, a pin will be a couple years away, but a spinning reel will do for now. "

1082205,Beans,2022-09-22 01:51:00,3339,This past weekend I experienced the reverse...Two of my sons and my oldest grandson used to rent a pontoon boat ($350 a day) the weekend after Labor Day in September because I can't handle getting in and out of regular boats any more This weekend they show up with a one year old Pontoon they bought because of my handicap...Have been out in it four times already...I am still flabergasted !!! Here I am getting on with no help from anybody....I feel I am not worthy but I must have done sumpin' right besides teaching them how tocatch fish...LOL
