1082721,Weeds,2022-11-03 19:56:00,782,That’s awesome. No mention of it in the article and I’ve always been poor at identification;would that be a tiger? Super cool regardless.
1082726,dave524,2022-11-04 10:58:00,4508,"Saw this one on a Niagara forum, believe it was caught Saturday night in the Fort Erie/ Crystal Beach area walleye trolling"
1082727,captpierre,2022-11-04 12:08:00,2521,Wow. Lucky to land that beast with walleye gear.
1082740,BITEME,2022-11-04 18:15:00,1968,What happened on the islands should of stayed on the islands🤫. Bummer!!
1082745,Weeds,2022-11-04 23:11:00,782,"Googling the article I can’t say I’ve ever heard the term “Cabbage Dragon” before either, but I like it,"
1082746,CrowMan,2022-11-04 23:21:00,413,"Cabbage Dragon...It's a moniker for Musky you often hear up in North Western Ontario...LOTW, Eagle, Lac Seul..."
1082747,Terry,2022-11-04 23:25:00,14456,Cabbage dragon = muskie and people complain about the word pickerel = walleye
1082771,limeyangler,2022-11-06 17:03:00,5204,"I fish all those lakes (except LOTW) and it’s the first time I’ve heard it, but love it!"
1082772,CrowMan,2022-11-06 17:35:00,413,Up in your neck of the woods... https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcu6YWlF8b3/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= I heard the term for first time on LOTW many years ago...and just this September I was at Lac Seul Outposts and heard it from the owners amongst others..
1082773,Rizzo,2022-11-06 17:47:00,4754,ditto...never heard that term before.
1082780,BillM,2022-11-07 05:26:00,17367,"Nope, just a spotted muskie.  Nice fish!!"
