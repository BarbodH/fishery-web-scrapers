472756,misfish,2010-06-05 15:08:00,29133,Thank you
472760,fishinfool,2010-06-05 15:33:00,366," Hey floatman55 I have been running it on Windows XP for some time now, I guess it is not meant to be run on Vista. Maybe they have a program that does the same thing over at the Vista site."
472761,scugpg,2010-06-05 15:35:00,1373,Irfanview is a very handy viewing/editing tool it's probably my favorite...and its free.
472791,muddler,2010-06-05 18:58:00,623,PhotRazor. The defau;t settings are perfect for embedding pictures in an email. Simple and easy to use. Free too.  http://www.stormdance.net/software/photorazor/software%20overview.htm  muddler

472810,BillM,2010-06-05 21:48:00,17367,Quickest Windows resizer there is..   Right click > Send to Mail recipient > Make my Pictures Smaller.  Anywhere from 320x400 to 1024x768.  
472831,jediangler,2010-06-05 23:42:00,1923,I use http://www.shrinkpictures.com and it works great on my Mac. Then again everything works better on a Mac   .
472879,Jonny,2010-06-06 02:25:00,1380,"VSO Image Resizer works fine on Windows Vista Home Basic and Home Premium. Just search it.  It has a little nag pop-up but it's free and works great for singles or batch re-sizing.  The Windows ""powertoys"" resizer works great on my older computer with Windows XP but doesn't work with Vista. New versions of Windows ALWAYS have to screw up some tried-and-true features. Microsoft doesn't seem to give a damn about that."
