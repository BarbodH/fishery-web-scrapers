1081780,glen,2022-08-21 17:02:00,2641,I’d like to go but it’s too much money and too far.
1081935,Big Cliff,2022-08-31 11:51:00,6899,Check your pm.
1081961,Big Cliff,2022-09-02 07:36:00,6899,Seat filled 😊
1081963,glen,2022-09-02 11:46:00,2641,Wtg Cliff.  Good luck.
1081964,akaShag,2022-09-02 12:47:00,2073,"Cliff, I have a whole bunch of hats you can have to take with you for photos............😁 Doug"
1082174,Big Cliff,2022-09-20 00:41:00,6899,"Well, the trip is on and the fishing is beyond belief. Yesterday was 70+ walleye, pike, and jumbo perch. Today was laketrout, 30 plus fish in about 4 hours of fishing, the biggest problem we had was trying to find some smaller fish, right now we are allowed 1 over 22"", ( no problem there) and 1 under 22"", best we could do was 2 under the 22"" and that was stretching it. I have seen some good fishing in my time but I have to say I am impressed!"
1082192,b2kptbo,2022-09-21 11:01:00,1505,Good one ya Cliff...

1082264,Spiel,2022-09-26 13:23:00,9065,Awesomeness right there guys. I need to get back to that lake some day.
1082267,misfish,2022-09-26 14:01:00,29133,Rod builders retire and get to go fishing ? 🙄  Great pics forsure. Thanks for sharing them.
1082268,akaShag,2022-09-26 14:22:00,2073,Excellent!  Glad it worked out for you fellows. Doug
1082270,glen,2022-09-26 14:54:00,2641,Great fish looks like the weather was nice too.  Jack looks happy.
1082271,GBW,2022-09-26 15:27:00,8460,"He is happy, he met and fished with Mr Bignell!"
1082275,misfish,2022-09-26 18:18:00,29133,"And Mr.Big, still flips the had backwards. That,s saying something. COOL DUDE. "
1082276,gordy28,2022-09-26 21:39:00,638,Awesome.   Glad it went/is going well those are some solid fish! Andrew
1082280,akaShag,2022-09-27 01:11:00,2073,"He did not have a dozen hats like his fishing partner, so he turned one around to make a second one...😉"
1080004,MadJack,2022-05-03 12:21:00,14,"Greetings all.  I am a retired lawyer/Small Claims Court judge, 69, been an avid fisherman since I was a teenager.  I have a fishing trip planned on Eagle Lake near Dryden in NW Ontario this coming September.  The fellow who has been accompanying me on this trip for the past several years has had to drop out this year so I am seeking a replacement.  Here's the lodge: https://www.templebay.com/ Tremendous fishing for walleye, bass, lake trout, jumbo perch, pike and the odd rogue musky and whitefish.  Full American Plan, meals provided including shore lunches, fully guided each day, and their guides are extremely knowledgeable and a heck of a lot of fun to fish with..  September fishing is great with the colour in the trees, lots of wildlife like moose, deer, bear, and bald eagles.  Super drive up there over several days with overnights in motels.  I've done this trip so many times I know all the good motels to stop at (and the bad ones to avoid) and the good restaurants for meals on the way (and the bad ones to avoid); super scenery as we round Lake Superior. I live in Thornhill so if from the GTA we'd leave on Thursday 15 September arrive at the lodge just after lunch on Saturday 17 September.  We fish to Thursday 22 September, leave after breakfast on Friday 23 September and make our way back.  If you're not in  the GTA may have to adjust that timing accordingly. It's not cheap. .  . roughly $2800 per person plus tips. . . cost of motels and gas for my vehicle we split at the end. But while not cheap, it's tremendous value for the money, the service we receive from the owner to the manager to the cook, the waitresses, the cleaning staff, and of course the guides is top rate across the board. So if you are interested shoot me a private message  and I can provide more details as needed.     "
1080006,glen,2022-05-03 13:27:00,2641,Looks like a great trip.  I wish I could go but it’s to big of a trip for me.
1080008,Terry,2022-05-03 16:08:00,14456,Great trip i wonder if I could start a go-fund me to pay for it lol
1080013,ketchenany,2022-05-03 23:33:00,3229,"Terry, you could ask Misfish to fund you. But I know what he would say! “Fund yourself”.  	it does sound like a great adventure for sure."
1080014,wkrp,2022-05-04 00:13:00,656,"I think you meant to say "" Go Fund Yourself """
1080018,GBW,2022-05-04 13:17:00,8460,I wish you luck finding someone.  I'm sure someone would love a trip like this. If you're ever headed out with your boat to Gooderham msg me as that where I moved to.  5 min from the lake...
1080019,MadJack,2022-05-04 13:48:00,14,I'm sure someone would love this trip. . . i just wish he (whoever he is) would message me !! And you may have me confused with someone else. . . I do not own a boat.
1080028,akaShag,2022-05-04 20:46:00,2073,Do you wear a different hat for every fish?  😉  Just curious.......I do hope you find a good fishing partner! Doug
1080029,MadJack,2022-05-04 20:58:00,14,Different hat each day. it's an odd tradition I have; every country I visit I always buy a hat and a t-shirt and on my fishing trip each day I wear a different hat/t-shirt from some country that I have visited.
1080085,limeyangler,2022-05-07 01:21:00,5204,"I’d go, but I’m already here… lol."
1080086,MadJack,2022-05-07 09:29:00,14,"Well, I would have no problem doing the drive from here to there on my own if you cared to join me there. . ."
1080089,GBW,2022-05-07 15:47:00,8460,Simon lives there.  Get him as a guide if you can!
1080146,MadJack,2022-05-10 15:02:00,14,The position has been filled.
1080153,HTHM,2022-05-10 17:21:00,4082,Congrats. Post pictures of your results.
1080240,akaShag,2022-05-15 00:19:00,2073,Good to hear.  Hope you enjoy yourselves! Doug
1080369,Salmon Catcher,2022-05-25 19:47:00,15,"Dont have to travel so far and pay so much. Im catching all May long lake trout in a range 10-22lb right of Port Credit, Ontario with occasional king salmon and steelhead trout for my clients. From June on 20lb+ salmon plus steelhead till mid September. October Lake tout is back + Coho and Kings.  Capt Bob, Salmon Catcher Fishing Charters."
1080370,glen,2022-05-25 19:49:00,2641,Sometimes a stay in the woods  is needed.
1080371,BillM,2022-05-25 20:13:00,17367,"Let's not try and compare a fly in lodge to Port Credit, lol."
1080377,akaShag,2022-05-26 12:46:00,2073,You said it much more politely than I was thinking...........
1080531,Canuck,2022-06-05 12:38:00,491,"When I had my boat in Bronte and fished salmon a lot, my kids (little at the time) called the salmon “Mealamonthfish” because they had heard me say that whenever I caught and released a big one.  Lake O is a great catch and release fishery for sure, but getting on remote lake with clean(er) water is a great experience."
1081700,MadJack,2022-08-16 12:36:00,14,"Well guess what. . . the fellow I had lined up has had to pull out, so I'm back to seeking someone to join me.  Same lodge, leaving from Toronto on Thursday 15 September, be back by Sunday 25 September.  If anyone has any interest in joining me, it's a great trip, shoot me a line with your email and I'll clue you in on all the details.  Jack"
1081703,Rizzo,2022-08-16 14:21:00,4754,well that sucks. Hopefully you can get the spot filled
1081704,Terry,2022-08-16 14:28:00,14456,I knew I should have started that go-fund me  account lol hope you find someone
1081757,MadJack,2022-08-19 19:06:00,14,"Well I hope so too. But, so far. . .       crickets"
1081778,MadJack,2022-08-21 16:42:00,14,"And, sadly, it looks like i'll have to cancel. . ."
