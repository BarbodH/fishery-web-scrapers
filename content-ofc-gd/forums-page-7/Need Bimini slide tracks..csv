1081989,glen,2022-09-04 12:32:00,2641,Need two Bimini slide tracks.Â  	near Barrie.Â  	Canâ€™t find a store that sells them. prefer under $50.Â  	maybe legend boats?
1081990,Terry,2022-09-04 14:23:00,14456,50 bucks is a good price  https://jtsoutdoorfabrics.com/Sliding-Track-Assembly-With-Nylon-Side-Mount--White_p_18996.html?lt_c=1&quickcart=1 but add shipping and itâ€™s about the same price
1081991,glen,2022-09-04 14:34:00,2641,Thanks Terry. I didnâ€™t know that place existed. Â Looks like curb side pickup in Barrie or shipping.
1081992,Terry,2022-09-04 15:35:00,14456,Well there you go

1082078,Hack_Fisherman,2022-09-11 23:51:00,720,JTâ€™s has been great for me to deal with in my boat build. No more storefront so curb/mail only. Their shipping times are very good
1082080,glen,2022-09-12 00:38:00,2641,I ordered rear supports and slide tracks and hardware. Â I need the tracks so I can slide it back out of the way when not in use. Â The rear supports will allow me to stop using the straps. Â That will give me more room at the rod holders. I got quick detach pins too so I can take it right off aka bass fishing. Â  	Hope it works out for trolling.
1082083,Rebait,2022-09-12 20:12:00,2,Hello Glen. I just came across this site and happened to see your question. I created an account to share my thoughts. I just installed a bimini on my boat last week but I reversed it front to back. When not in use it folds over the windshield and lays on the deck. When up I can fold it back 1 or 2 of the bows instantly depending on the fishing situation. Will never be in the way. The 2 rear braces are now at the front and attached with quick release pins I got from amazon. These pix are from the mock up but you can see the plan.Â Its pretty slick.   
1082114,glen,2022-09-16 21:00:00,2641,Wow thatâ€™s great. Nice boat too.Â  	thanks for the ideas.
1082121,Rebait,2022-09-17 00:45:00,2,"Thanks Glen-- It's a 1969 Crestliner-- 120 mercruiser IO. full welded aluminum. When I bought it I gutted it, redid all wiring, hydraulics, outdrive and new flotation below the floor. Created my own interior with a large ""dance floor"" for fishing Lake Erie. I left the patina because it took 50 plus years to earn that look! Greg"
