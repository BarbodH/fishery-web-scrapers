1082455,Snidley,2022-10-13 13:24:00,620,"Plant them and net pen them so they distribute well. Ban roe harvest and derbies to establish a mentality of assistance to the stocking by minimizing a thoughtless slaughter. Open up upper reaches of tributaries to allow salmon and rainbows and browns toÂ  achieve at least a modicum of spawning success. There might even be a place for trying to replace alewives as the primary food source for salmonids in the Great Lakes (lake Herring would be one option as they provide food for salmonoids and people)). Non of this will ever happen of course. The MNR is run by people that really have a minimal understanding of their job, just like the rest of the pencil pushing goofs in our civil service."
1082456,mitch seguin,2022-10-13 13:50:00,98,Last sentence totally inappropriate.Â  Please consider editing your post.
1082457,Fisherman,2022-10-13 14:38:00,7201,"Seems kind of an oxymoron that if there were no pacific salmon other than early seeding of some chinook and coho failed miserably. Pinks were not really all that successful until around mid 1950's,Â  so how can bow hunting for salmon other than Atlantics be recognized as something FN's did that far back.Â  Other than Atlantics, they were not there."
1082461,Snidley,2022-10-13 15:43:00,620,"Fisherman is correct. the same could be said for snowmobiles, hunting rifles, power boats etc. I have met with the MNR on the subject of Atlantic/Pacific salmon/rainbow issues as well as the walkway conversion of Lake Ontario shorelines. I stand by my statement on them and on the rest of the gang at Queens Park and various other government locations.Â  The Feds are even worse in that the corruption is monumental."
1082462,msp,2022-10-13 16:04:00,1336,Agreed
1082463,msp,2022-10-13 16:07:00,1336,So you are saying that indigenous people should only be able to bow hunt Atlantic Salmon ? Not sure if I understand your rational ?
1082465,Snidley,2022-10-13 16:21:00,620,"I think a great many Canadians are sick and tired of the Native claims about nature and a lot of other things. The idea that the natives now or in the past were master conservationists are not based in fact. It's politicking plain and simple. They want money and resources and are fully prepared to sabotage the entire country to get them. You might remember a small group of Indians shut down the entire rail system of Canada just prior to Covid. All to sabotage resources getting to market, a sabotage that now has world shaking consequences as our allies in Europe are facing serious repercussions of gas not being available from reliable sources like Canada. It is not just the natives to blame, the dilatant posing as a PM is also to blame leading to my point re our government as a whole."
1082466,Terry,2022-10-13 16:31:00,14456,I think there should be limitations on what is traditional and what is abuse i think there should be a different set of rules for a native who has fully integrated in Canadian society and one living on a reservation
1082467,Fisherman,2022-10-13 17:09:00,7201,"Yes,Â  same as using tugboats pulling nylon nets for harvesting lake trout and white fish,Â  that was not part of the equation when they were subsistant harvesting over the long period.Â  Heck nylon wasn't even invented until 1939. Â  Same goes for using spotlights for night hunting."
1082469,Spiel,2022-10-13 18:33:00,9065,"Pacific salmon.....ewwwww  	Not in the headwaters of native trout streams, thank you.... NO!"
1082471,Snidley,2022-10-13 18:42:00,620,"Pacific Salmon are found in headwaters of the streams in the west of Canada and the USA, without detrimental effects to either . You know, the place where the trout and salmon come from. In fact salmon carcasses actually FEED the trout and create the circumstances for flesh flies to be great trout lures."
1082486,DanD,2022-10-14 13:27:00,2223,I'll bide (Or hold my opinion) by the natives rights the day I stop seeing them selling walleye or whatever fish out of the trunks of their cars. I was so pissed at my dad because he was a regular customer of this one native guy. Dad was (He's passed now) a bigger problem then the guy selling the fish; he gave the guy an avenue for income. Dan...

1065887,Snidley,2020-09-20 21:59:00,620,"At this time of year the wardens are busy wit much more egregious poaching than that. Wildlife like bears, deer, moose etc take a pounding at this time of year. Nice to see that bow fishing in a crowd does not seem to alarm the other ""anglers"". Soooo... I guess it is safe."

1065919,chessy,2020-09-21 23:00:00,610,if he is native nothing can be done .. 2 years ago i was at ganny and a native was bowfishing downtown shooting arrows in 6 inches of water as they moved up stream people were standing 30 yards away from him as he shot towards them . i called police and they told me they have had a number of complaints about him doing it and the mnrf told them that if the people felt unsafe to move as the native has more rights to be there then them... this is nothing to do with racism as i have a native grandchild.. i am not happy that they can do it ... but they can

1082358,Bessogon,2022-10-05 08:49:00,2,"I went bow fishing for salmon for the first time last year, and it was an amazing experience. The river was so full of fish that it was hard to track them all, and the action was non-stop. I even snagged a few fish myself, which was a real thrill. It's a different way to fish and one that I recommend to anyone looking for a new challenge. You can find all the necessary tips on https://bowarchery.com/best-bowfishing-lights-for-muddy-water/. Also, there is a lot of valuable equipment. Suppose you're lucky enough to get on a river with a good run of salmon. In that case, you're in for an unforgettable experience"
