Â I don't have any of those and before I run out to buy them I'd like to get you opinions. Â Will using a standard screw type clamp lead to fuel leak or air leak issues down the road? Thanks"
1082317,BillM,2022-10-01 12:41:00,17367,I like ear clamps for fuel lines.Â  Take apart anything with fuel lines and you'll see manufacturers do as well
1082319,siwash,2022-10-02 01:37:00,683,Thanks... I'll give em a try! ðŸ™‚
1082323,porkpie,2022-10-02 15:50:00,2521,"Ear clamps work well but Iâ€™ve replaced many a fuel line with stainless hose clamps because thatâ€™s what I have and itâ€™s never caused a problem with many hours on the water. Â Either way you go youâ€™ll never have an issue because of the clamp, itâ€™ll be something else that causes problems."
1082375,Hack_Fisherman,2022-10-05 22:04:00,720,Depending on the hose size I use the OMC Zip ties that are designed for fuel lines. They have a little bit of a curved seat so that when tight it gives it a 360Â° seal. I prefer these over the old clamps. Theyâ€™re easy to cut off and change the lines if need be
1082434,Rattletrap2,2022-10-12 15:24:00,1652,I am partial to the ear style crimp clamps because they do work very well and are neater than a worm gear clamp.
1082440,Lape0019,2022-10-12 17:07:00,647,I would use a hose clamp in a pinch to get by but would later replace it with the proper style ear clamp. That is what was used on my boat when I bought it so I would think they chose that for a reason.
