1082502,Doug V,2022-10-15 21:50:00,4,Howdy...new member here.  Looking for recommendations for shop that does transom work. I would like to to have the plywood core removed and replaced with composite material over the winter...I'm thinking coosa or a sea cast type repair. I'm located near Bancroft so wondering about shops in the Quinte or Peterborough area. 	Thanks in advance. Doug

Rangers do not split the cap from the hull, so the only way to do this repair is to cut out the splash well, perform the transplant, and re-glass the cut out section. I did a transom transplant on my former Ranger a number of years ago. It is a lot of work. A very good resource is the ""bassboat restoration"" sub forum on Bass Boat Central. https://www.bbcboards.net/forumdisplay.php?f=118"
