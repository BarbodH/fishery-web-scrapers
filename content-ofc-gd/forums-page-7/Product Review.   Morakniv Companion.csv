I was recently in the market for a new one, something for our fly in and canoe trips.   Here’s a review of the knife I chose https://www.northernjacks.com/post/product-review-morkniv-hd-companion  Cheers 	Andrew  "

1082575,gordy28,2022-10-20 03:12:00,638,Thanks.  I think I fixed it.   	My brother bought the one you are talking about and is also happy with it.  And you are right.  Great value for a solid knife cheers Andrew

1082584,Weeds,2022-10-20 19:16:00,782,Victorinox also make nice knives. I’ve had better luck with them than Henckels. 12 inch chef knife with the rosewood handle is my go to kitchen blade.
