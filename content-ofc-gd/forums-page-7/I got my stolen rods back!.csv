1082562,Ron,2022-10-19 16:51:00,1683,"I was at one of my suppliers when one of their employees approached me and asked if I had fishing rods stolen. I replied yes in deed I have. WellÂ  this guy found some rods near his house last October and reported it to the police. I got his name and phone number and went to the police station. At first, with me being me, demanding they go through their recovered property and see if they have my rods. Emails went back and forth to the point they said the items I was looking for were not recovered and it must have been mistaken. Well, a week goes by, low and behold, I receive another email from the stolen property recovery stating they in fact DO HAVE MY RODS.Â  With the description and photos submitted, it was without a doubt, my property the email said. I go to the station and was quickly reunited with my fishing rods! Everything in tact, only, my IMX tip top guide is missing the SIC insert. The police had them in their possession 4 days after reported stolen! ðŸ˜³ Bottom line.... I'M HAPPY TO HAVE MY HIGH END RODS BACK! CHEERS... "
