Armed with lures made by board member Misfish.  One lure caught lakers, bass and white fish.  Caught some real nice ones. Drove around in the boat about 80miles. Had great company so not much talking to myself.  One night it was  almost 0deg.  I had to get up at 2 am and hook up a new propane tank.  Almost froze it was so cold.   "
