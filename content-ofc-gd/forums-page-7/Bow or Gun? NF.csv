1082605,ChenDirit,2022-10-24 12:59:00,5,"Bows and crossbows are quiet and, thus, better for ambushes. Arrows can be recovered and reused. Bows are easier and cheaper to produce than firearms. Bows like the English longbow are more accurate over greater distances than a musket in the hands of a well-trained archer. I love hunting with a bow. I always search for new places to hunt with the bow on https://archerytopic.com/. I like being silent during the hunt because it is easier to meet a wild animal. Shooting with the rifle once means that all of the animals will run away."

Yes with more velocity than 450 fps you need an FAC. There are air guns out there that fire at far higher speeds. I think there was a thread here about them a few years back. It showed a video taking down a small Deer with .177 air caliber pellet.  To answer the question of is it a gun I found on the RCMP website anything with a barrel that can fire a ""projectile"" that can cause bodily harm is considered to be a Fire Arm. So it has a barrel and can fire a projectile that can cause bodily harm.  Of course I can't cut and paste here anymore. Time to get Google Chrome?"

Is it a bow or a gun? I'm leaning more to the gun side of things, to me a bow uses mechanical force to propel a projectile."

The fact it shoots an arrow has nothing to do with the fact it's not a bow.  I've shot traditional archery for 30 years so my views on what a bow is, and what bowhunting is, are much more skewed toward actually having a bow and string somewhere in the design. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to be walking around with that thing and call myself a bowhunter. It belongs in the gun season at best."

Changing it to a prohibited device because it can be used in an obscure pistol/rifle hybrid (10/22 Charger) when there have literally been thousands of the mags in Canada over the past 30 years with no criminal use is asinine. The recent Horsemen decision to prohibit the CZ 858 Spartan is also stupid. Same as the non-restricted CZ 858 but it has the words MOLON LABE, a spartan head and a maple leaf inscribed on it. For that reason it's prohibited. Or the RCMP calling the Mossberg Blaze 47 an AK47 variant and prohibiting it when it is a rimfire rifle the shares 0 common parts with an AK and is functionally identical to the non-restricted Mossberg Blaze.
