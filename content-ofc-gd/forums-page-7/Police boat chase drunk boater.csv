I wonder if our local marine police boats can go that fast!  incredible acceleration, speed and power!  PS: looks like the video in the first link has been sped up, but entertaining nevertheless ?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gcG7G03m48  original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3nka4bToW4&t=693s"
1035923,OhioFisherman,2018-10-31 23:46:00,6623,I don't think  would play bumper boats with ones that much bigger than mine?

He wasn't trying to flee, he was trying to drown. I am impressed with the speed and agility of tose 2 big boats. There is a saying in Boxing. "" A good bigger man will always beat a great smaller man."""
1082547,Jordansazerland,2022-10-18 21:02:00,2,"""OMG! Was that dude drunk for real?! I couldn’t watch the video till the end. He made so many circles on that boat that it made my head spin. Can someone please tell me how did this end? 	Still, I watched half of that video, and it seems like that dude has serious problems with his head. Who would do something like that? 	But people surprise me more and more every day with the things they pull out. Recently, I ran into one story — Tony Dosen for sheriff. It’s about one dude who pulled different things while serving on the police force. Compared this drunk ass seems innocent compared to that dude Tony Dosen."""
