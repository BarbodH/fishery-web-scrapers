1081829,chessy,2022-08-23 19:07:00,610,well my insurance company has now issued a second Marine specialist company to investigate the issue. they sure do like to spend money on a 2800 dollar claim ..
1081830,Snidley,2022-08-23 19:22:00,620,Possibly looking for fraud from a repeat offender...or just stupid. These days it's hard to tell.
1081831,chessy,2022-08-23 19:27:00,610,yes that's what I was thinking ... its a suspicious claim to begin with ..
1081832,Snidley,2022-08-23 19:48:00,620,"To be clear it's  Merc I'm referring to as it is a big company and it's not like big manufacturers don't defraud the public, often but not always with impunity Whistleblower gets record $24 million for exposing Hyundai and Kia's safety lapses - CNN $24 Million for rating them out. Not bad work if you can get it. Also as of this morning Hyundai and Kia are telling owners of Palisade and Telluride SUV's to park them due to fire issues that they have no fix for"
1081833,chessy,2022-08-23 19:53:00,610,I wish they would take the parts and have them tested for strength ..  I would love to have it rammed down Merc throat 
1081835,Podric,2022-08-23 20:56:00,46,I am missing something.  Did the dealers volunteer this information or was it a reply to a question asked. Ever think think the question was unintentionally loaded so that they would give the safest answer? Maybe they were loading up to sell insurance on the motor.
1081941,chessy,2022-08-31 16:28:00,610,am I entilted to the first apraisaers investigation report ? they now have a second appraisers on the case
1081942,Snidley,2022-08-31 17:30:00,620,"Knowing the insurance industry as I do I would not hold my breath waiting for the insurance company supplying you with anything especially if it were to indicate their liability to ANYTHING. The insurance industry is in cahoots with the government on virtually everything that has to do with insurance in this province. That is in cahoots AGAINST you as the public and in cahoots with the industry in just about anything they would like to pull.  It's yet another group of thieves working with self centered dilatants that have one goal, get re elected no matter what."
1082096,chessy,2022-09-14 17:21:00,610,there now telling me my motor is used... because it was manufactured in 2017.  lol.  I wish I had recouse to sue them for slander lol.... I was the original owner in 2020. 
1082102,Snidley,2022-09-14 23:29:00,620,"This is all part and parcel with things like builders taking deposits and upon completion of the condos demanding further payments on top of the agreed upon price, auto makers doing similar things to the tune of a further $9k for an F150, and our leaders looking to private sector senior homes, charging $5000 + a month for a room with all the Covid and Shingles you could ever want thrown in for free. Then there's The Bank of Canada saying that there's no risk of inflation, then saying inflation is a prime target, then raising interest rates at an alarming rate just when the population has record rates of debt denominated in variable rate loans and mortgages. All done without recourse for all of us. Good move. On a further note I was just at the library and they had a donation jar out. I asked was the library resorting to a tip jar. Answer no but they still want a donation even though the girls there claim there's no financial issues with the library system in St Catharines. The city did  did need to appeal for donations for the Labour Day firecracker show however."
1082103,AKRISONER,2022-09-15 13:54:00,5558,"This reminds me so much of the issues I had with my Dodge Ram and the Egr cooler leaking raw exhaust directly into the cab of my truck, me subsequently bringing the truck in 5 separate times under warranty for them to not fix the issue while I continued to get poisoned…until I ran out of warranty and took my truck to my local diese mechanic who immediately identified the problem and sent me back to the dealership to have the recall work on the EGR cooler completed. my case has massive law suit written all over it, but it’s effectively  impossible to take to court."
1082104,Snidley,2022-09-15 17:51:00,620,"When i was living in Oakville I saw a massive news report, breaking news if you will, dealing with a potentially catastrophic front end issue with F150 pickups. The front end would wobble so badly the truck could potentially topple over. The reporters tracked down the customer relations talking head for Ford at the Oakville head office. He ran away from  the reporters and locked the door refusing to come out and take questions. When they got him on the phone and asked why he was avoiding them he answered truthfully. Why would he subject himself to tough questions from reporters? In the end Ford claimed the problem was a faulty front end suspension, a parts issue from a supplier. Their suggested solution. The truck owners should take their beefs to the supplier as it was out of Fords hands. I never followed up on what the final result of the issue was but I could not believe the Ford customer relations guy would A) hide from reporters and B  suggest the faulty part was not Fords issue and that customers should take it up with a supplier directly.. Had it been a Chrysler issue they would have sold a bogus warranty and then the customer could take their beef to a parts supplier and a warranty provider. It would have been an automotive double header. "
1082108,AKRISONER,2022-09-16 13:11:00,5558,"One of the things I have gotten to do in my career is engage with multiple of the automotive manufacturers in Canada along with many of Canada's largest companies i.e. Loblaws, Coke, Walmart etc. Lets just say, seeing how they operate at Ford Corporate was enough to ensure that I never buy one of their vehicles."

1082116,Snidley,2022-09-16 21:32:00,620,A new electrified Escalade is $152 USD and they can sell every Escalde they make at full pop. Don't know if that true of an electric Escalade. Oddly the new GM Lyric is only $62 USD and advertised for $69 CDN. If so that price delta between the US price and the converted Canadian price means a convoy of Lyric's heading south of the border within a week of delivery up here  Yesterday In St Catharines i paid $1.39 for reg gas Deisel was $1.88 and winter is coming.
1081086,chessy,2022-07-08 20:59:00,610,so I have been told by 4 different dealers that if you are trolling along and you run over a stick and your prop just pushes it down it is enough to bend your prop shaft and destroy your lower unit ... I don't make this crap up just passing info off to anyone who wishes to buy a murcruy 9.9 pro kicker ...
1081088,Spiel,2022-07-08 21:25:00,9065,Chinese made parts.
1081089,BillM,2022-07-08 21:31:00,17367,"A stick, lol."
1081091,glen,2022-07-08 23:42:00,2641,At 20mph I hit a 3”dia 8’long log.  Still green because it was chewed off by a beaver but waterlogged. it bent the prop and the prop shaft everything else was ok.  Still went fishing that day.
1081092,Dara,2022-07-08 23:55:00,3052,"I saw a boat yesterday with 4- 450 Verado's on it. I doubt a stick would bend that/them shafts. PS, Merc parts made in China are to Merc specs Not a motor I would buy  Edited cause I reread the OP"
1081093,AKRISONER,2022-07-09 08:56:00,5558,"Interesting, because that’s the second bad brand new mercury story I’ve heard in a single day. Yeeesh"
1081095,RandyLinden,2022-07-09 12:18:00,40,"I'm guessing this is about a warranty claim vs an insurance claim... The what if game can be played with a never ending set of scenarios where that could perhaps damage the lower unit under the right conditions or circumstances. The fact that the lower unit operates below the surface and we can not always see or notice exactly what's down there makes this a possibility for sure but is this the only possible cause? I would suggest that it is also possible that a lower unit fails because of a mechanical failure. Let's play the what if game on that side for a minute. What if there is a lower unit bearing failure? What if there is a defective gear that causes the failure, What if the lower unit was not set up properly from the factory, What if there was a lubrication problem etc. etc. How should an insurance company look at this? Just because the majority of lower unit failures are from striking foreign objects it doesn't mean that they are all due to that and let's face it if there is absolutely no evidence and no visible signs of contact how can we know? We need a lower unit autopsy... How should a manufacturer that has a warranty on this lower unit look at this? Once again if the cause is unknown should they just replace the lower unit? Maybe in a situation where it is not practical to analyze all the components and it's impossible to determine what happened, it might be appropriate for the manufacturer and the customer to share the cost of the repair and move on. On the other hand we do not know what happened and we purchase insurance in case something happens. I would suggest that an insurance claim should be filed and then let the insurance company negotiate with dealer / manufacturer about how they want deal with this matter."
1081097,Fisherman,2022-07-09 12:28:00,7201,Well I would say this will make some negative advertising for Merc. I would rather row than ride in front of a Merc.
1081098,Spiel,2022-07-09 12:53:00,9065,"For the record I run a Merc (75 tiller), no complaints.  	I hit a solid granite shoal up at Lakair one year, mid speed, the motor kicked up right out of the water. 	It sheared a vertical chunk along the full length of the skeg right behind the prop, not a mark on the prop and no internal damage at all. 	The skeg damage wasn't even enough to warrant having it fixed. I'm guessing it was at least 12 years ago now, the following picture was just taken. "
1081099,chessy,2022-07-09 13:55:00,610,I am just paying out of pocket cause I am not one to have someone pay for something that is a mystery to  me 
1081100,HTHM,2022-07-09 14:56:00,4082,"Did you not ""pay out of pocket"" for insurance?"
1081101,chessy,2022-07-09 15:00:00,610,yes .. but I pay 800 a year for boat insurance and nearly 15000 for fleet insurance and I don't what to increase my costs for 2500 bucks... how much would my insurance jump for a claim ?? 
1081102,porkpie,2022-07-09 18:02:00,2521,"At this point, I wouldn't be paying out of pocket to the tune of $2500 to fix a motor that has proved to be a dumpster fire so far. I'd either run the claim through because 4 dealers are telling me it's possible to damage like this or I'd cut my losses and buy a used honda kicker off Kijiji.  That's just me"
1081109,BillM,2022-07-10 13:16:00,17367,Dropping $2500 on a '21 kicker that never worked properly from the get go would be a hard pass for this guy.
1081110,kickingfrog,2022-07-10 14:02:00,8333,New motors have shear pins stronger than the prop shaft? lol
1081117,chessy,2022-07-11 13:21:00,610,not on a pro kicker no shear pin 
1081120,Fisherman,2022-07-11 14:10:00,7201,Must be a rubber device that allows the prop to rotate when hitting something.
1081124,chessy,2022-07-11 16:28:00,610,nope its straight shaft.. no protection like the big motors... 
1081125,Dara,2022-07-11 16:32:00,3052,"Thats a good idea, no shear pins to worry about, just simply buy a new bottom end"
1081126,Fisherman,2022-07-11 17:28:00,7201,Well I guess you have to thank an engineer for that oversight.
1081127,Dara,2022-07-11 17:31:00,3052,More like the parts guy that wants to boost sales.
1081136,kickingfrog,2022-07-12 15:28:00,8333,"A few dollars for a pin versus thousands for parts, makes sense to me."
1081137,Snidley,2022-07-12 15:49:00,620,"I was out trolling in Lake Ontario and the Merc kicker died. I did not feel us hit anything but sure enough lower end unit fried and dealer said we must have hit something. This, among many other things that always cost at least $1000 and required months of waiting for the repair to be made, drove my buddy to sell his boat and get a little Bass Tender (a  bath tub that can be loaded into the back of the pickup truck). It works for him at his cottage a Oliphant. He did buy a Honda mini motor, a 4hp I think and then more problems with a brand new motor. Honda, being Honda took it in for repairs no problemo but in the end they could NOT fix a brand new engine and returned his money. It turns out Honda does not even make the motor, it's made by someone else and Honda slaps their outer casing on it, but they can't make it run, lol. Don't get me started on my buddies Ram 2500 diesel truck. $100K worth of problems with a nice interior"
1081139,Dara,2022-07-12 23:20:00,3052,"We used to have a 9.9 merc bought from a lodge around Wawa. We ran the heck out of that motor, across beaver dams, through ice, dropped it off the back of the truck. It kept on working  Buddies don't buy rams☺️"
1081140,chessy,2022-07-12 23:26:00,610,its going to be interesting cause my insurance company which I broke down and called.. is going to send there so called top appraiser to investagate the  so called damage
