1082075,Hack_Fisherman,2022-09-11 23:19:00,720,Does anyone know who makes this particular spinner bait? I lost a willow blade in a tree mishap and it the one lure that catches everything on my lake. I’m still using it minus the one blade and it still out catches everything else I throw out there. it’s not Strike King. Been through their entire line. Can’t recall where I bought it but I’d like to find a few more of this pattern. Any other popular brands I should check? It likely came from CT or Sail but I haven’t been able to find in my latest stops.  	TIA

Only in the attached image.  It might be called Kraken?  https://secureservercdn.net/72.167.25.213/6a7.ea3.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Lunkerhunt-Impact-Series-Ignite-and-Thump-Kraken-Spinnerbait-C.jpg?time=1662143153"
1082079,Hack_Fisherman,2022-09-11 23:54:00,720,That it!! Thank you. I remember the name Kraken. There’s a black and blue one I’m after too and that’s one of theirs. Thanks much!

So I got 6 and paid for 4, on 2-3 of them the rear blades would not spin, made in China with very low quality ball bearings in the swivel, no problem for me, I had good swivels on hand and replaced them. I let them know of the swivel issue, now they may have changed the name, colors, and suppliers? I always preferred closed eye spinner and buzzbaits."
