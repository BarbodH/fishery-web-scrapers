747302,Joeytier,2012-11-27 23:31:00,3990,I don't remember the last time I ever went to the grocery store for fish...between the trout perch pike pickeral bass ling etc easily available locally why buy fish that has travelled thousands of kms in the back of truck.
747316,Snidley,2012-11-28 00:21:00,620,"Eat like a caveman. www.marksdailyapple.com I read up on it and now do my best to practice it with some exceptions. I still do not eat beef, pork or sheep but game is ok and fish is the mainstay...for me. I really feel better since I started a few months ago"
747323,woodenboater,2012-11-28 00:41:00,2277,"re:beef  There was an article somewhere talking about Xl and large processing plants and the gist or one of them I think, was that even though beef may have been raised hormone free/grass fed etc, the processing plant may negate those benefits through poor cleaning etc.. I'll try and find the article but it had a 'don't be so smug kind of warning for those who choose to eat that type of beef."
747336,Snidley,2012-11-28 01:13:00,620,If you really want to be sure about the beef or pork or sheep there are farmers that run a delivery sevice for the GTA to specific drop off points but not to your home. They invite you to their farms and then you can see how the animals are raised/slaughtered and then place an order that will be delivered later. The meat IS frozen however.

747421,SirCranksalot,2012-11-28 14:00:00,3291,  and I read in the paper that alfalfa sprouts are carcinogenic!!   
747422,Mike Pike,2012-11-28 14:06:00,1332,I like all the information in the arcticle about sustainability too.  It's something that I never used to pay attention to( and I think alot of my generation is the same ).  But my daughter and a lot of her friends seem to be more aware of sustainable seafood and make their choices accordingly.  Always something to learn.

The lean protein and omega 3 (EPA/DHA) content is really what makes fish desirable for healthy food consumption.  One factor to keep in mind is the content, or possible content of methyl mercury. In which case, the smaller the fish, usually the less methyl mercury content, but try to be conscience on the matter and do a little research. Shrimp is horrible for contaminants for example.  As far as red meat goes, I like moose and deer, personally. I just take my fish oil after eating it, lol (as I do with every meal)     "
747674,manitoubass2,2012-11-29 03:49:00,11391," Thats roughly what I take too, 10-12 grams daily. I take more if enjoying a few adult beverages however.  All the health benefits are great, but my favorite is nutrient partitioning/negative inflammation reduction.

747112,Snidley,2012-11-27 15:47:00,620,"I wonder where the fish that Chinese people eat would be classified. They eat Milkfish, a plankton feeder and spectacular gamefish if you can get them to take an algae fly, Capelins,a smallish fish that looks like a really silvery sardine and Bassa which I know is a horrible farmed catfish  to eat. There's literally hundreds of other fish they eat if the frozen fish locker at the Y&M is anything to go on. There might be some very  good options there if we knew about them."
747129,Christopheraaron,2012-11-27 16:23:00,3525," Depends on where they come from I guess, and yes, Rodney's is great!"
747133,Billy Bob,2012-11-27 16:33:00,5865,Just about ANY fish is still better then red meat....  It's just the red meat industry has lobbiest in government to not give you the details like eating fresh caught fish.
747159,adolson,2012-11-27 17:44:00,783,"I've seen these types of lists from various sources and they're all a little different, but they usually have a few things in common - wild Pacific salmon and Canadian farmed non-Great Lakes rainbow trout. As fish go, I mostly eat those and trouts I catch myself (and sometimes walleye, bass, and pike, but that's all increasingly rare for me).  But out of curiosity, what makes red meat so bad for you? I don't eat it every day, but I'm just curious why everyone says that, but never really gives a reason. When I eat a steak, I eat the fat and everything. But I buy the locally-raised, grass-fed, antibiotics-free, hormone-free stuff from Mennonites. And yes, it tastes much better than the grocery store stuff. Mmm, conjugated linoleic acid..."

747171,Mike Pike,2012-11-27 18:04:00,1332,"Love da oysters so nice to know they're good for ya!  Actually, I was already aware of that.  Last year, I bought an oyster shucker and took up the fine art.  There are no oyster bars that I knew of in Hamilton( Burlington has a couple, though ), so I had to learn how to do it if I wanted to enjoy 'em.  Pretty easy to, actually.  Lots of instruction available on youtube."
747174,ch312,2012-11-27 18:14:00,1590, high cholesterol and saturated fats in red meat are a couple reasons you should limit your intake. fish is definitely a healthier alternative assuming it's not taken from the hamilton harbor and deep fried before being dipped in tartar sauce...
