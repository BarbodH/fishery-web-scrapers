747476,BillM,2012-11-28 16:32:00,17367, Ask Dan how many times he's been in the water.  I think that demonstrates common sense more then anything
747480,UglyBug,2012-11-28 16:38:00,148,"  I dont go fishing to be ""IN"" the water..I always like to be ""ON"" the water. I would think thats a typo. If not, all the more reasons to wear the thing.."
747489,BillM,2012-11-28 16:50:00,17367," Read it a few more times, it's not a typo."
747516,hirk,2012-11-28 18:01:00,571,"If I trolled alone Id have it on 100% so I could get back in,if my boat used the shifter for throttle same thing,to get back in and not get cut to shreds when it starts running circles.I worry alot more about falling in cold water while fishing and wear a suit or pfd then getting thrown from the boat. I always hooked up when running say low 80's + but 60-70 something not usually,with a foot throttle its down to idle right away if you get tossed. Short of hitting a log or rock in average conditions it would take bad driving or stupidness to get thrown."
747572,aplumma,2012-11-28 21:14:00,6896,common sense is dictated by changing conditions not inflexible statements. There are many cases where a tether is not needed or wanted. You can be trolling baits and you shut down the motor every time you get out of the seat? Running a no wake zone and standing to see wood or channel markers.   Art
747584,Crazy Ivan,2012-11-28 21:53:00,184, About 5 feet when fully stretched out. If I get tossed out it kills the engine.
747600,northernpike56,2012-11-28 22:53:00,717,I wear mine usually
747609,camillj,2012-11-28 23:06:00,1988,"Thanks for all the feedback. Keep it coming - especially if you have any experience with any of the 'wireless' options.  My tether came 'stock' with the boat ... 197 with Yammy 150 ... but the tether is only about 10"" long and totally dangerous imho considering I am MOSTLY standing with one hand on the the throttle and one hand on the wheel at all times ... if I inadvertantly killed the engine by reaching for something I think it would be worse (but obviously I am still rationalizing or I wouldn't have brought it up here) ... I am going ask my fellas at the Marina where I bought the boat what the Standard Operating procedure is for my boat (which was designed to for 'big water')... personally I kinda like the submersion technology to avoid false engine kills.  In the video I saw with the nasty accident, the guy didnt go overboard but was bashed around pretty badly... and because my boat will stay pretty much at the RPM you set it - it could be just as dangerous to others as to myself if I was knocked down/out... of course because I am an old fart and don't get my jollies doing any 'silly' driving I am rarely bouncing around too much... but ya know ...there is a reason they call em 'accidents'"
747806,aplumma,2012-11-29 21:55:00,6896,"The wireless MOB is really nice if you have others on the boat or areas where you can't see everyone. I am talking boats you overnight on with a lower deck or galley ect. They will shut down the boat if someone falls out in a blind spot while you are running the boat. It is important to have them put in a bypass in case one of the senders malfunction. We were out once getting ready to ski when we went to start the boat it wouldn't start. We looked all over the boat for the issue when we finally figured out the skier had the wrong vest on it was one with the sensor on it. The issues of them are Batteries to replace, false trips in the rain and no protection if you are tossed around in the boat but not over board.  Art"
747814,misfish,2012-11-29 22:38:00,29133,"The older/long time members know this story. Hope it helps save.  The year was 2002 I think   . I had bought my first, new tinny,and was putting my 1978, 20 hp Johnson motor on it. The motor was on a 1969 traveler faberglass run about (CUCUMBER GREEN). Not knowing, when a motor is on a steering boat,the movement of the steering is  loose.I attached this motor to my tinny and it was now a tiller. it was always a tiller,but rigged it so it was a steering motor (wait,ENGINE)Feeling good Roy/Paul  .  My first outing was out on Little lake here in Barrie for some spring crappie. Today these tiller motors come with a kill tether,MINE DID NOT.  I was moving from spot to spot all morning long.All was well. Then this happen.   I was at full speed, when all of a sudden, a simple pack of smokes started to fly off the bench. I reached for them and YEP,the tiller swings to the left,I go right, and over board I go. Wearing long johns and heavy cotton track pants,a t-shirt and wool pullover.  Heres where someone was watching over me.     When I went in,I seen everything. I seen bubbles,the boat go by. When I came to the surface,I still had my glasses on   . Im in shock at first,but regained myself pretty quick,knowing Im in trouble. Treading water was pretty tough with all that cloths,but I wasnt going down. There was another boat out there,and they came over as fast as they could. By the time they got to me,my boat had circled,and came right back to me   . I reached and grabbed that hull with all my might,probly 3-4 trys. Once I did get a hold of it,I felt safe,and I never thanked the guy above more then I did then.  That was some real scary stuff.  Funny,when my brothers and sister were wee ones,my pop always made sure out PFD,s were on.Think I would of learned their not seat cushons.  Guess when we get older,we think we know better.  When I got my bass boat,it had a tether.   I NEVER, EVER,DID NOT HAVE IT NOT ATTACHED TO MY PFD.   LESSON LEARNED.  Glad Im around to share.   PS,,,,,,,,,,,  I do believe, she was watching over me,,,,,,,,,,,,Grandma"
747864,chris.brock,2012-11-30 00:20:00,4053,"Last summer, I was in my 10' Jon boat trolling for lakers (not using the tether). The elevated seat I was sitting on broke. It felt like slow motion, but as I fell backwards, it seemed there was 2 options- try to stay in the boat and risk dumping the boat, or flop into the water  I flopped into the water and managed to grab the gunnel. No problem except for being soaked.  I could have fell into the prop, or fell into the water and watched the boat motor away.  It was a good story when I came in soaking wet, family and friends had a good laugh"
747248,camillj,2012-11-27 21:43:00,1988,"Not sure if this Poll has been done before ... but a video I just watched about a pretty scary accident which happened when the driver was tossed made me wonder ...  1) Do you wear your Kill switch safety tether  a) Never  Sometimes c) Always  2) Explain  I gotta be honest ... I have struggled with this ... especially with need to dash to the back of the boat to deal with stuff (rods, Downriggers, netting fish etc)... it's something though I'd like to hear about from others ... and if there is some 'workable' compromises .. eg. just hook up for running etc."
747255,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-27 21:52:00,10439,I've never used mine in the 21 years I've owned the boat. When running my attention is on driving and my hand is always on the throttle. Plus my boat's slow!!! Top end is about 37 MPH and cruise is 26-27 MPH. I always drive for the conditions and slow right down in crappy weather.  I definately see their use when running fast boats or seadoos. When running my buddies doos I always wore the tether.  I could also see wearing it if you were a newby to boating as you have yet to learn about what can happen out there on the water.  Driving my boat I'm pretty mch in a cocoon in the drivers seat. If I got tossed out I would be in some serious trouble as my leggs would probably be still in the boat!!!!!
747265,fishnsled,2012-11-27 22:08:00,3520,"Sometimes, more often than not these days.  Rough conditions, always attached. Especially after reading about JP's incident during the tourney, last year I think - maybe the year before. I tend to drive for the conditions and not push the limits of the boat. That being said, you never know whats up ahead."
747270,Garnet,2012-11-27 22:22:00,2056,I wear my Auto inflate lifejacket with my tether attached 80%.  I don't take the jacket off so that forces me to us tether.
747281,Roy,2012-11-27 22:33:00,13728,"Up until a couple of years ago, I seldom wore it. Now I always wear it if I'm alone in the boat and wear it sometimes when I'm not alone depending on conditions and speed. I run a tiller so it might be a little less cumbersome because of my proximity to the motor controls and trolling rod(s). I've lengthened the tether about 6 inches...enough to easily access things I need but still short enough to kill the outboard should I have a mishap. I also now wear my PFD at all times whether I'm stopped or underway."
747290,aplumma,2012-11-27 22:49:00,6896,I am guilty of not wearing mine always. I do put it on when it is cold or the conditions are rough in the bass Boat.    Art
747292,camillj,2012-11-27 22:53:00,1988,"I look at it often ... and wonder if I could find a way to use it without expletives  ... well ... as result of this little poll I did a google and found two options ... have any of y'all seen em or used em ?  1) Virtual Lifeline “wireless lanyard” - Submersion based wireless tether  and  2) Autotether ""wireless tether"" - Proximity based wireless tether   Jeeze .. I may actually have found something to give the Mrs to put on my Christmas list !"
747299,206,2012-11-27 23:16:00,563,mine is always hooked to my life jacket....unfortunately i rarely wear the life jacket anymore
747300,Terry,2012-11-27 23:25:00,14456,if I am by myself I wear it and when I had a 60mph boat I wore it all the time
747304,tb4me,2012-11-27 23:35:00,3295,"I only wear mine when alone or out with my young daughter.. Id hate to fall out trolling and not be able to catch up...If im with the boys i dont wear it.. I figure if I fall out one of the other guys can stop the boat.. I bought an extra long cord for mine, When I do wear mine I clip it to my shoelaces.."
747305,krixxer,2012-11-27 23:37:00,274,Nah  I tried to pull it at modest speed and nothing happened. I never bothered after that.  
747320,Fisherman,2012-11-28 00:38:00,7201," You mean the engine didn't quit?  I just about did a face plant one day when I stood up to grab the net and forgot about the short cord. If the conditions dictate and I'm alone, I wear 2, one for the motor and another 550 cord to tie me to the boat."
747325,grimsbylander,2012-11-28 00:49:00,3016,"I always use the lanyard. Even though I'm in a bass boat now and use it, I can say that I also used it when in my old tinny too. Actually, I think it was just as important in my small boat. That boat was easier to get knocked around in and the motor would turn hard right turn if you let go for more than a few seconds. I guess I just got in the habit of wearing it and now it's like a seatbelt...I don't even think about it."
747330,woodenboater,2012-11-28 01:00:00,2277,^ this
747332,wallyboss,2012-11-28 01:03:00,1095,Mine is always hooked on my PFD. I always wear my PFD when I am moving with the outboard. But as soon as I stop to fish I take my PFD off.
747334,fishindevil,2012-11-28 01:06:00,6254,For years when I was salmon fishing miles out on Lake Ontario down rigging or on quinte I do if I'm by myself !!!!! I always did but not with another person in the boat but it is a good habit to start and wear it all the time
747337,aplumma,2012-11-28 01:16:00,6896,  That style is quite popular for larger boats that see big water. The inboard boats usually do not have lanyards to use but have keys and toggle switches for starting/stopping the motors. You can also find MOB alarms that clip on the vest if the boat is large enough to not be able to see kids/ adults that need the extra pair of eyes on them.   Art
747358,BillM,2012-11-28 02:35:00,17367,"Nope, don't wear it.   If I'm out with the oldman, he hates going fast so the engine stays at about 3500rpm, lol."
747364,Sinker,2012-11-28 03:00:00,8692,"My engine doesn't even have one.  The throttle will back off, and it will spin in circles though.....  S."
747365,danc,2012-11-28 03:05:00,4677,"I've worn mine on a few occasions when conditions were threatening, but 99% of the time I don't. Common sense prevails here."
747418,Crazy Ivan,2012-11-28 13:56:00,184,I wear it when running in rough water. I took out the stock tether and replaced it with and old curly headphone cord I had laying around. Now I can wear it and move around the boat when downrigging alone in choppy water.
747430,UglyBug,2012-11-28 14:24:00,148,"  ""Always"" If  big motor on so is life jacket and kill switch No exceptions in my boat. Just like seat belt you get into the habit"
747432,UglyBug,2012-11-28 14:28:00,148," Without causing any hard feelings, I would say not wearing it demonstrates a lack of common sense."
747439,Roy,2012-11-28 15:04:00,13728, How long is it? Doesn't that defeat the purpose?
747449,wormdunker,2012-11-28 15:30:00,1711,"This past summer I started wearing my PFD at all times.  75% of the time I have the tether connected to my PFD, cause my 14' Lund is scary fast at 29MPH.  I troll alot on my own so i feel it's safer to snap on the tether.  Better to be safe than sorry!"
