747595,Snidley,2012-11-28 22:44:00,620,I know they opened today but I see nothing on their website to make me visit. Anyone drop in?
747652,captpierre,2012-11-29 02:25:00,2521,I thought I heard they were having a 30% off everything sale.  Can't find any details on line
747654,Snidley,2012-11-29 02:34:00,620,"I just saw an ad on TV and it's minimum 30% on clothing and a minimum of 15% everything else. Surprising they would not make an issue of it on their website. Typical Canadian retailers, no marketing smarts what so ever. They deserve the deep holes they dig for themselves."
747657,cram,2012-11-29 02:54:00,1733," Putting it on their site risks cannibalizing revenue from other nearby stores (ie., if I'm about to spend $500 at the burlington store but realize I'll save 150 by driving to etobicoke).  Putting big signs in the neighborhood around the store draws local customers."
747658,Dan668,2012-11-29 02:56:00,1120,Went there. Came out empty handed. Decent selection but no sales besides the fifteen off
747714,zenon11,2012-11-29 14:30:00,75,"I went yesterday. If you already know what you want to buy the 15% off works, but you won't find any fantastic deals on any nice to have items."
747726,Snidley,2012-11-29 15:29:00,620,"I would suggest that national tv advertizing would also cannibalize any sales in Burlington in favour of Etobicoke. The point of almost all retail is to drive traffic and then capitalize on that traffic with as much high gross product (usually impulsive items) as possible. Sail is not doing this with their website nor is LeBarons, Fishing World, Gagnons, Cabelas Canada or any others I can think of. Bass Pro Shops has a very effective web presence in the USA but up until recently when free shipping to Canada was introduced  the Vaughn store was so out of touch that they viewed their own website as their major competitor. Literally 10 year olds could do a better job web selling than Canadian sporting goods retailers do currently."

747760,misfish,2012-11-29 18:17:00,29133,One in Etobicoke and Vaughan??????? Little much IMO.
747777,Harrison,2012-11-29 19:18:00,2202," Hey, I am no where the size of the big boys, but I am at least at a 16 year old level."
