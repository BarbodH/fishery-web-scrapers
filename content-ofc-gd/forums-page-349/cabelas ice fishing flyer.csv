747717,bow slayer,2012-11-29 14:47:00,1074,"just going through the cabela's ice fishing flyer that came in the mail I noticed that they have the new jiffy propane powered auger. I was thinking that this would be great,no more carrying gas,oil,no more gas leaking ,no more gas smell. It says a 1 lb. propane canister is equal to one tank of gas. The price is the same as a gas auger.Has anyone heard any feedback on these as reliability is concerned.I would be interested in selling my gas jiffy for one of these.  Also as a side note about the flyer they have their guide rainwear on for about 50% off,so you could get an 2 piece set for just under 300 dollars.  Also lots of ice fishing gear in the flyer,shacks,combos,boots and so on"

747750,Lunkerhunter,2012-11-29 17:10:00,455,just purchased the guidewear...  anyone know if the taxes and duty that i was charged cover all the costs? will i be billed again from fedex or whoever ships the package?
