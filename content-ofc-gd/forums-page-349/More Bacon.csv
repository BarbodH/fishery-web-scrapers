747015,adolson,2012-11-27 02:16:00,783," The nutrition ""science"" is hilarious. Eggs are bad! Eggs are good! Egg yolks are bad! Milk is bad! Milk is good! Cholesterol is bad! Saturated fat is bad, buy our white synthetic butter-type spread!  Currently, the so-called mainstream is all, ""low-fat is the way to go, and here is the science to back it up!"" The paleo guys laugh at the absurdity, but then turn around and do the exact same thing, only with a different macronutrient: ""Low-carb is the way to go, and here is the science to back it up!"" I expect a low-protein craze to pop up any day now, ""low-protein is the way to go, and here is the science to back it up!""  Every day there's a new bad guy we all need to avoid.  Personally, I don't do the low-fat or ""diet"" products. I also don't worry about dietary cholesterol or saturated fat. I do try to avoid HFCS, MSG, artificial sweeteners, hydrogenated oils, refined sugars, and unnatural trans fats. I regularly eat bacon, actual butter, coconut oil, two dozen eggs per week, bacon, nuts, local chicken and beef and bacon, lots of fish (especially trout), and bacon. I think you'll find most of this to be agreeable, yet pretty much against the traditional mainstream. But I also eat salads, fresh fruits and vegetables, potatoes, and whole grains as featured in english muffins, pastas, rice, and breads.  Paleo works for you, and that's great. Balance and moderation works for me. Or at least it appears to be... Maybe I'm secretly still morbidly obese and all the fat is just hiding on my back so I can't see it!  If all the carbs I have been eating ever suddenly kick in and I gain back the 100+ pounds I've lost, I'll look at cutting out all fun and happiness carbs from my diet."
747091,fish_fishburn,2012-11-27 14:01:00,1311,"There all fads as far as I am concerned. Heres an idea for loosing weight and maintaining it. Dont eat anything with flour or sugar in the ingredients and get 1 hour a day of exercise.And remember moderation, its all about moderation as well."

746689,Pikeslayer8,2012-11-26 02:06:00,336,"Hey everyone, Thought that I would share a picture of my Thanksgiving Turkey (American version).  I threw on 2#'s of bacon on the top of the bird in a weave fashion.  Roasted it in the oven @ 325* for 4 hrs. covered.  Pulled off the foil for the last 15 minutes for browning.  Just crawling outta my bacon/turkey coma. But hey, it was worth it. Delicious!       Yea, happy belated Thanksgiving to the other southern outdoors-men that visit this awesome site.  Mine was pretty good other than having my Mother-in-law visiting for 4 days.  Ouch"
746691,mistaredone,2012-11-26 02:09:00,913,Awesome!
746697,Live2fish85,2012-11-26 02:20:00,1633,Man does that look good. I think I am going to have to get me some bacon and a turkey soon haha.
746705,adolson,2012-11-26 03:01:00,783,I wanna try this!
746708,Joey,2012-11-26 03:14:00,9122,"Oh man, that looks sooooo gooood!!!  I'm gonna have to try that"
746712,funfishing,2012-11-26 03:17:00,147,"You know, one NF would have sufficed  I've never seen anything like this before, sure looks good though"
746715,Joeytier,2012-11-26 03:43:00,3990,Bacon-wrapped bird is always a smart choice.  Love it...
746717,mercman,2012-11-26 03:50:00,7054,You guys sure know how to eat. If i lived down there i would seigh 1000 lbs. That bird looks delicio. !!
746720,danc,2012-11-26 04:02:00,4677,"I cook my Grouse in similar fashion, but one strip of bacon cut in half does the trick for them.  Looks good enough to eat!!"
746725,Toad Hunter,2012-11-26 05:12:00,261,"damn that thing looks good, but I see room for more bacon... perhaps in the stuffing... ?"
746769,Pikeslayer8,2012-11-26 16:02:00,336,"Thanks  Thanks Chris.  I just bet you will.  Go for it Dana.  Thanks Joey.  The gravy was amazing.  Don't want to offend the NF internet police.  Thanks Joeytier   Thanks Mercman.  I think that I honed my bacon cooking skills in Canada, however.  I'll come right out and say it.  Bacon wrapped foul is the way to go for succulent birds. Bacon wrapped Grouse.    Toad Hunter, You so get me.  Bacon in the stuffing.  Marvelous. Actually, I did."
746779,Toad Hunter,2012-11-26 17:03:00,261,You know where I stand on the bacon food group. - Everything else is a side dish
746786,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 17:32:00,3525, no whole wheat bread?
746809,Pikeslayer8,2012-11-26 18:43:00,336, Bacon is meat candy
746825,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 19:28:00,3525, Reasoning?
746828,BillM,2012-11-26 19:44:00,17367,There is never enough bacon! MMMMMmmmm
746844,adolson,2012-11-26 20:06:00,783, Are you a paleo guy?
746873,mercman,2012-11-26 21:03:00,7054, oh ya....so whats my excuse:dunno: ..................no...wait....don't answer that Sin:glare:
746881,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 21:15:00,3525," You saying that bacon is better for you than multigrain bread, potatoes or oats?"
746883,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 21:19:00,3525, Where are you getting your bacon?
746888,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 21:28:00,3525, Can you take a photo of the cholesterol on the label?
746891,davey buoy,2012-11-26 21:34:00,5505,"Yesterday,cooked a big ham,already cooked I MUST SAY.Put in the oven for 1.5 hrs at 325*. My goddness,the outer edges,to die for!,only regret no bacon wrap. But it is a ham,soooooooo gooood!!!Best next thing!!!!!!!!!!"
746894,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 21:42:00,3525, I'm just wondering why you think that grain products are so bad for you.
746902,adolson,2012-11-26 22:00:00,783," I eat all of this stuff. In fact, I've eaten more of it in the last year and a half than I have the rest of my life, and I've lost between 100 and 120lbs in that time and feel so much better than I ever did. Can't be all THAT bad for you.  Over-eating is what makes you fat. If you eat 4000 calories a day, of anything - even just bacon, but your body and activity only burns 2500 calories a day, you're still going to gain weight. It's not magic, it's not a mystery; it's just how it works.  I have heard the paleo argument, and it's OK if you want to live like that. It may work well for you and others, and that's good. But I don't think it's for everyone. I need my carbs. AND my bacon."
746906,misfish,2012-11-26 22:10:00,29133,"First off that looks SWEET.  I like to wrap my breasts with bacon.   Skinned goose breast,you dirty dogs.  If Im doing a turkey like that on the BBQ,it,s the same. Skin it and wrap with bacon. I try to get to my buddies place,so I can get that double smoked bacon.   As for the other NF, off topic stuff,,,,  Good on ya Dana.  When I did the weight loss. It was fish,chicken and greens.  Lots of cottage cheese and olives too.  Now that I did that and felt great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,        I LOVE MY BACON."
