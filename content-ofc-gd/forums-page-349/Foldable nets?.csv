Some of those things they call nets are rattier than a Polish grandma's undies (think Olga Netski)! What's out there as an option in foldable nets that doesnt compromise performance and can handle the odd larger fish. Should I get a smaller net ""walleye size"" and go with a gaff for the odd big northern or marry someone who's not Polish?"
748341,kickingfrog,2012-12-01 19:05:00,8333,I would never bother on a fly-in and rarely use a net anyway but when I do I use this:  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Gold-Series-Folding-Landing-Net-with-Telescoping-Handle/product/10210368/?cmCat=CROSSSELL_PRODUCT   No good for big pike though.
