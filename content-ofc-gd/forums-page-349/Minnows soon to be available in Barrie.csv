She has just informed me that they will be selling minnows this ice season to supply anglers in and around the Barrie area. They are located at Minet's Point in Barrie, on the south shore of Kempenfelt Bay. Great to hear a local business still making it here in town! Good luck to all this ice season, stay safe and may your catches be plentiful!  Jesse"
