I want to start some Lake O fishing for Bows and Salmon this spring and have absolutley NO gear for this.  What are everyones reccomendation for Rods, reels, Lures....

747453,Skipper D,2012-11-28 15:36:00,1970,I am not sure what to ask her for but ask for two of every thing ok ..................
747456,Oryx,2012-11-28 15:43:00,186,"If I ask for 2, that would imply I would share with her  She is of the mindset that 1 rod and reel is good for all scenarios......"

747466,Skipper D,2012-11-28 16:03:00,1970,"  Wrong ! you have to tell her you want to share with me ..... lol, Merry Christmas i hope you get all what you want ."

747499,Roy,2012-11-28 17:13:00,13728,A fishing rod as a stocking stuffer? Do you wear pantyhose?
747522,Oryx,2012-11-28 18:27:00,186,"Yes, I wear pantyhose, keeps the boys in check!  And a coupon book is a good idea, but I will be able to go without too much hassle.....as I said, she is very accepting of my addictions...."

747532,Joeytier,2012-11-28 19:13:00,3990,A 10' Talora dipsy stick should fit snugly in a stocking
747541,Joey,2012-11-28 19:55:00,9122,"Paul buys most of our gear, but from the top of my head, I can remember we buy spin doctors from JB's, atomic flies in blue or green, flea flicker line (although some brands are better than others, not sure which tho), cannon balls, salty dog rod holders, Cannon electric or manual downriggers.  How's that for a start?  I'd have to ask Paul for the names/types of rods and reels we use.  Joey"
747546,fishdawg,2012-11-28 20:08:00,912," in order to help you out, lets begin with:  a)does your boat have downriggers and appropriate rod holders already? will you be doing this trolling solo or with others?"
747554,Oryx,2012-11-28 20:30:00,186,"Alright here goes,  I will be fishing with my buddy in his boat.  We currently have 1 x Scotty 1080 manual (bought from OFC classifieds) since only one rigger, the need for a double duty rod.  We will be adding 2 x 12"" cannon trax this winter to mount the rod holders and the rigger base to.  I will need the rods, reels, dipseys, line, flashers and lures.    Cheers    j"

747565,captpierre,2012-11-28 21:02:00,2521,"Boy.  I would take a gift certificate to LeBaron's any day.  Then spend it on one of their ""no tax"" days.  Be like a kid in a candy store"
747575,fishdawg,2012-11-28 21:19:00,912," Yup that helps,and yes as mentioned above, tell the wife to stuff the stocking with many gift cards from your fave tackle dealer  If you dont end up getting a second rigger, and still want to run 4 rods when the 2 of you are out, I would reccomend  1) donwrigger rod/reel that will hold at least 300yds of 20lb mono 2) 2 diver combos 8-9ft med-med hvy, with either 30lb 7 strand wire or 50lb braid, on mid sized linecounter reels (brand as budget allows)and run Size# 107 Walker Deeper Divers off of these 3) one large sized trolling reel with 100 yds or 10 colours of Leadcore line and a 8/9 foot trolling rod.  I see your from Pickering, go to Tightines Warehouse and they'll fill in the rest."
747579,aplumma,2012-11-28 21:34:00,6896,Coupons for coffee from your favorite vendor. Gas card from a local station. Warm waterproof gloves. A furry hat that makes you look ridiculous but you don't care because it is sooooo warm. These are just a few of my favorite things.    Art
747625,Joeytier,2012-11-28 23:58:00,3990,"There's no such thing as a double-duty rod.  Dipsy and rigger rods have wildly different actions, so one of each would be necessary."
747628,Oryx,2012-11-29 00:12:00,186,"As I know next to nothing about this, what are the differances between a dispey and a rigger rod?"
747858,i2cool2fool,2012-11-30 00:14:00,349,I literally laughed out loud. Great idea.
