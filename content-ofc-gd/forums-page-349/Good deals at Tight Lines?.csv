748406,Bernie66,2012-12-01 22:31:00,123,Was it your first time in that store?  They always have those tags left on their rods from the spring shows.  Fishing Depot and Grimsby Tackle also leaves those tags on all year long.  At 12'6 I would assume its the Raven Matrix.  A decent deal for $115 but its Ravens lower end model.  You could've also asked for no tax if you have enough cash on hand.
