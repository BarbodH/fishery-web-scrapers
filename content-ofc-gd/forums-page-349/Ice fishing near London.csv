747733,Freshtrax,2012-11-29 15:49:00,2215,"I just heckle the the snaggers till they leave around alliston in the fall. "" what you can't catch one? You have to snag him""    ""snnnnnnnnaaaaaaggggggeeeeerrrrrrr,snnnnnnnaaaaaggggeeeeerrrr"".   And don't evven get me started on the vultures on simcoe in the winter that swoop in on us when we're catching fish we call them hole jibronies.    Good for you man more people need to stand up and protect our fisheries.  Back on topic.  If we get a cold winter and you have a floater suit you could fish some of river mouths on Huron as well.  You might catch a few fish"
747741,Headhunter,2012-11-29 16:26:00,5703,"Many folks ice fish the Thames in the Tillbury area for Pickereyes. I've done it, but didn't have a great deal of luck (hey atleast I'm consistant!) That's about an hour or so drive west on the 401 for Londoner's. The only other place I ice fished relatively close to London was Long Point Bay. Hope this helps? HH"
747744,BucktownAngler,2012-11-29 16:53:00,582, Did you smoke a dutchy before you wrote that?
747780,BillM,2012-11-29 19:36:00,17367,"Lots of ruffled skirts in this thread, lol"
747788,Twocoda,2012-11-29 20:02:00,4130,they are called KILTS...and they come pleated...not ruffled  Dutchy sounds like your due for some Steel action...come on up...Ill play host
747798,Twocoda,2012-11-29 20:25:00,4130, Goderich harbour a little over an hour drive from London.....
747809,i2cool2fool,2012-11-29 22:05:00,349,Thanks for all the replies! Bring on the hard water!!!
746236,i2cool2fool,2012-11-24 15:04:00,349,"Hey all. I have never ice fished and think it might be a bad idea to try this year (cause I'll probably enjoy it too much and get hooked).  Anyway, does anyone have any suggestions for a rental / service fully rigged up so I can try it out?  Or perhaps someone into ice fishing is looking for fresh face in their hut?  I can bring good eats, etc.  Anyhow, thanks for reading and consideration. If you prefer to PM me, cool. If not, that's cool too."
746254,bow slayer,2012-11-24 16:49:00,1074,"hopefully this winter the weather will be a little nicer for hard water. Your best bet for finding a operator for huts and gear would either be long point( contact rotten ronnies for info)) or mitchels bay(contact dennis at bass haven for info and check out his site basshaven.COM) and rondeau bay.There are a few ponds(mill pond,sharon creek,pond mills ponds,and maybe fanshawe lake) in the area where if the ice is safe you could venture out on with a few simple items,tip ups or small ice combo,manuel auger or spud,terminal tackle,small sled to haul gear,hole scoop,small portable shack ,all of this comes up regularly on the classified section or kijiji and can be picked up very reasonable,probably less than 2 trips out with a outfitter.  I have all the gear and hut  but not the time to get out much if ever(3 kids in travel hockey and work)I even have a brand new jiffy power auger still in the box never opened that has been there for 4 years. But if i can get out and the ice is good i will post to see if you are still interested."
746255,i2cool2fool,2012-11-24 16:54:00,349,"Thanks for the great info and offer. Hopefully Long Point freezes up nice this year. I better go tune up my sled. It's amazing how a fresh, light blanket of snow can put an extra bounce in ones step."
746274,adempsey,2012-11-24 19:24:00,1498,"I've only been in London for a year now, but last year I just traveled north to Simcoe and further.   I might try somewhere on St.Clair this year if the weather cooperates.  I'd recommend heading up to Lake Simcoe or if you just want to give it a try Island Lake near Orangeville."
746277,Woodsman,2012-11-24 19:54:00,1286,"Come to Seaforth & you'll not say ""light blanket of snow"". About 8"" here. Maybe we can set-up a local day trip somewhere this winter. I have all the equipment & than some. If there's a good freeze on Simcoe this is what you can get. "
746279,i2cool2fool,2012-11-24 20:02:00,349,Beauties!!
746299,Woodsman,2012-11-24 20:39:00,1286,"Here's our ""light blanket of snow"". "
746302,i2cool2fool,2012-11-24 20:41:00,349,Even better. Makes me want to start the sled.
746304,Woodsman,2012-11-24 20:48:00,1286,Just picked up an older sled.  Now I have to change the ownership & insure it.
746314,i2cool2fool,2012-11-24 21:19:00,349,My relic...  
746315,i2cool2fool,2012-11-24 21:22:00,349,Nice ride you have there.
746471,Rich,2012-11-25 11:58:00,3927,"Long point bay has some good hut services, but often some boring fishing. Id say its worth the drive to lake  simcoe."
747092,Marko,2012-11-27 14:02:00,854,Wildwood (sp) conservation area by St Mary`s. People fish for pike right by the dam
747160,Woodsman,2012-11-27 17:51:00,1286,"I know the area well. Use to live 10 mins away. Ice can be quite dangerous there if you don't know it. Changes quickly as it is a flood control reservoir. Don't go by theirs others out there it must be safe. I've seen many out there when my spud only found 2"" of ice 50' from shore. If water levels raise shoreline ice may disappear quickly. Be careful there.  Rick  BTW: Not sure on how dam construction & lower water levels this fall will effect icefishing."
747308,i2cool2fool,2012-11-27 23:47:00,349,"I fish Wildwood frequently in the summer. I used to dock my boat there.  I agree with Woodsman about the ice conditions there. I have heard a few stories about cold, wet fisherman."
747383,Dutchy,2012-11-28 04:08:00,416,"Dorchester Mill Pond is OK. Pike, crappies, bluegills, pumpkinseed, usually fairly constant bite if you fish the deep runs. There is another species in there, but it is not widely known, so I ain't posting what. If you want to know, send me a pm. And   no I don't mean bass  I'll defo hit it at some point, so if you wanna go keep it in mind."
747391,Rich,2012-11-28 10:53:00,3927,"Dorchester mill pond just lost all its fish populations thanks to that post.  Ps i took my inflatable there for 4 hours and got 2 of the ""secret species"".. Its really no secret and im sure one of the hoards of people going there this winter will get one and post it for ya this winter."
747402,jjcanoe,2012-11-28 12:19:00,744,"Wildwood is at record lows right now, there are actually islands in the middle where the used to be 15' of water (not actually islands but shoals not connected to the shoreline) the dam construction is done, hopefully the water returns soon but unless there's a load of snow........"
747405,i2cool2fool,2012-11-28 12:34:00,349,Yeah. The water level was crazy low this year. Wildwood closed up in August this year. Start the snow dance now.
747483,BucktownAngler,2012-11-28 16:41:00,582,Came across this link on twitter.   http://www.ontariooutofdoors.com/icefishing/2013/  Has pretty much all the hut operators in Ontario on there
747636,Dutchy,2012-11-29 01:28:00,416," Yeah sure Rich, cause no-one ice fishes in Dorchester."
747642,hotsky,2012-11-29 01:45:00,400,"I tried it this summer, seemed really shallow, weedy and muddy only stayed there for an hour. What's the secret species? Walleye?"
747681,Dutchy,2012-11-29 04:59:00,416," Not that exotic  Rich is acting like no-one ice fishes there. Confronted guys walking away with way over their limit. Being 6""3"" and 300 lbs I can do that because no-one typically is dumb enough to mess with me. The secret species or 2 is not spectacular, just not well known about and can only be caught in certain areas which apparently Rich is lucky enough to hit in 4 hrs. They are not in there thick, just there. First fish I ever caught in there ice fishing was one of them.  I wish I was a conservation officer in Ontario, like some people here seem to think they are.  Its why I don't post here anymore.  This site is full of wankers who think they are the law. Go ban me Roy, couldn't give a crap. They guy asked about ice fishing around London. I hope he contacts me and we can go fishing together. Thats the point. Opinions are like cuties. Cuties????? Seriously, thats the best you could come up with? Lets all be secretive and never fish anywhere that anyone else every could, like Dorchester. Good one Rich. I thought you were better than that. And I know where the pinks run. Maybe I'll let that out next............................."
747689,Rich,2012-11-29 10:29:00,3927,"Ooh you're scary boogie boogie. Let it out man, like i care, they wont be back next year just like your crappies and walleye in dorchester."
747693,Rich,2012-11-29 11:01:00,3927,"Ps you said you illegally enforce the law with intimidation, then said everyone ELSE acts like a CO. At least they do it online, not in real life with bully tactics."
