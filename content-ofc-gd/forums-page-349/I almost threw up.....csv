746131,mike rousseau,2012-11-24 00:16:00,4661,Tonight I lost the biggest walleye I've ever seen in person... It would have been my PB by far....  I thought I had another musky and all of a sudden this tank walleye shows its face... I reached for the net but it was too late.....  I almost jumped in after the beast....  A small tear rolled down my cheek and my stomach turned....  Gunna be thinking about that one for some time....  Aaaaaarrrrrrggggggghhh!!!!!!!

I found out later that week a buddy of mine hooked a new state record two days later from the area I had the hook up.  Art

747022,adolson,2012-11-27 02:34:00,783,"I feel your pain, Mike. I almost jumped in after a fish once. It wasn't a PB, but it was a trout, so that's practically the same thing."
747503,FishTracker,2012-11-28 17:22:00,47,"Sorry for the loss, Mike.  We've all had those experiences.  It's what makes fishing so addictive and heart-breaking all at the same time, right?  I hope you get (and land) it's grandfather next time"
747513,mike rousseau,2012-11-28 17:43:00,4661, I'm still trying to get her.... I'm hopefull that the fish is gunna stay in the area and I might have a shot at getting her.... It's a wintering spot so there's a good chance it will stick around... The odds it'll hit again are slim... Bur there's a chance....lol
747850,bucktail,2012-11-29 23:59:00,1857,what do you think her stats were?
