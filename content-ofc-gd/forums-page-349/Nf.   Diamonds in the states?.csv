746803,Freshtrax,2012-11-26 18:31:00,2215,Well I got back late last night.  The golf was amazing and buying the ring in the states saved me about 2000$. I went out on black Friday. The jewelry store was busy but not crazy.  Ended up with a 1.3 carat  ring for 1100$. It was marked down 75%. Comparable rings this side of the border were 4-5k before any discounts.   I'm gonna take her to a tree farm to cut down a chrismas tree tonight and pop the question.
746831,Spiel,2012-11-26 19:48:00,9065," Sounds romantic, I hope she accepts!"

746880,danbouck,2012-11-26 21:13:00,4380,I bought my wife's off ebay for $300 and got it appraised for $4500. But I'm a cheap bugger
746886,Roy,2012-11-26 21:24:00,13728," Remember, you won't get an honest answer from her if you're holding an axe when you pop the question."

747551,capt_hooked,2012-11-28 20:18:00,212,"Forget the diamond....  they are NOT forever...!  She'll only lose it in the ice-cream... that she sells to some snot nose kid .. who unknowingly swallows it....  And then the insurance will not pay up.. because it is considered a mysterious loss...  Then you're going to feel guilty for the next 10 years, because you are too damn cheap to buy her another one...  Better off to spend the money on a trip to Jamaica.. the memories will last forever..!  "
747563,aplumma,2012-11-28 20:59:00,6896,Why Cap. I do believe there is a story here lol.   Art
745193,Freshtrax,2012-11-19 21:58:00,2215,Anyone know if it's Considerably cheaper to buy engagement rings in the states? I'm headed to NC for some golf next week and I'm in the market.   ?  I know all about the repairs and duty ect... I'm strictly wondering about sticker price. Online it seems like allot more bang for my buck south of the border.
745196,bobowski,2012-11-19 22:34:00,360,The answer is yes. But you have to buy from a wholesaler. I just recently bought a ring online at jamesallen.com and had it shipped here. I had to pay tax on it but it was still way cheaper then buying it here. They have a great website where you can see the actual diamond before you buy it.
745197,captpierre,2012-11-19 22:37:00,2521,"Had to replace wifies lost diamond.  Went with a Canadian diamond. Bought locally.  Apparently because they are all identified by laser, they are the only proven conflict free diamonds out there.  Check locally from private jewelers.  Don't be afraid to haggle.  Big differences in quality.  If you have a problem with a ring bought in the US, good luck getting service"
745200,BillM,2012-11-19 22:46:00,17367,"Sites like www.bluenile.com have better prices then you'll find up here.   Certified diamonds, great customer service, can't beat them."
745217,cram,2012-11-19 23:26:00,1733, +1
745221,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-19 23:39:00,10439,We just dig 'em up out of the ground up here.
745239,Whopper,2012-11-20 00:36:00,2174, Don't really know what you were trying to imply capt.  Buying something or anything at all from a business that is reputable shouldn't be a problem no matter where it is.  Yes we do have reputable jewelers in the US.
745241,Cast-Away,2012-11-20 00:43:00,790,Glad that you are not getting engaged to me!
745248,chris.brock,2012-11-20 00:57:00,4053,"I'd be leary buying something like a diamond sight unseen, a 1 carat diamond could be worth from $1500 to $10,000 depending on it's quality, if you shop around locally,and look at a few diamonds at different retailers, you can see yourself the difference colour, clarity, cut etc I would be worried about getting screwed buying online  I would shop around up here, get to know what you're looking at, from Raffi, Burks, and Peoples, then go to NC and shop around there  I remember when I was shopping for one, the lady at Peoples had a big one for a cheap price, looking at it through the magnifying thing, I could tell it was flawed and a piece of crap, just because I had already looked at quite a few"
745250,Freshtrax,2012-11-20 01:00:00,2215," Lol she will be fine with it, from the research I've done She will get 30% more more bling  for my money down south with the same certification and quality as here. Thanks for the input everyone I just wanted to make sure  there wasn't something I was missing."
745268,captpierre,2012-11-20 02:31:00,2521,Not saying you Yanks aren't reputable.  North Carolina is a long way from Ontario to resolve a warranty problem
745303,Musky or Specks,2012-11-20 05:41:00,2710,Engagement rings are never cheap. Just ask anyone whos been divorced
745305,irishfield,2012-11-20 06:05:00,26272,"You can get screwed walking into Jeff Walters in Barrie too.. Leah's wearing one that cost me 10 grand... that turned out to have a big oculsion thru the center!    Looks real nice.. just don't look toooo close. Oh and BTW.. that was for our 25th Anniversary, her original ring set (engagement and band) cost us $420 in 1982. Flashy and big doesn't add to the love attached!"
745307,cram,2012-11-20 07:18:00,1733,"Blue Nile. It's a very reputable company, and it displays as much or more data on each diamond as you can hope to obtain in person."
745309,Billy Bob,2012-11-20 11:28:00,5865,"Women are IMPRESSED by the over all size.....as ""they"" say SIZE DOES MATTER....  With that said......NO women is going to pull our a magnifying glass to look it over...if it's SHINY and LARGE they will be impressed....AND when they show it off......NO ONE is going to pull out a magnifying glass and say...hey, this diamond has a flaw.... jeweller's pray on those who want a flawless diamond that no one can see anyway's....THINK ABOUT IT.....  And with that said I wasted my money getting my bride a flawless ring 33 years ago...if I would do it again...I would buy LARGER and not worry what it looks like UNDER a magnifying glass...."
745316,mercman,2012-11-20 12:48:00,7054,"  Got That right Wayne.Mine cost me a few grand 20 years ago, and 3 weeks ago i came home to find her gone, and the rings on the table.  Pawn shop wasnt inpressed with the diamond, only the gold:w00t:"
745322,Fish4Eyes,2012-11-20 13:35:00,1022,"Not sure how much you are willing to spend, but I would be going to St Marten (especially if you plan to spend big bucks on a ring). You can get a vacation out of it for free compared to how much you pay for the equivalent here. From what I have herd, amazing deals can be had by simply going to a bank."
745362,Rich,2012-11-20 16:39:00,3927,Just use an onion ring
745366,Headhunter,2012-11-20 17:03:00,5703,"I don't understand the ""warranty"" issue... what are you looking for in a warranty? The ring either keeps it's set stones or they fall off... either way, if you have an insurance rider on the ring, it will get fixed for a deductable... it's not like we are talking about moving parts etc... Get 'er the ring that you want and can afford... the realtionship's the hard part! LOL HH"
745375,torco,2012-11-20 18:27:00,656,Can't add much but just don't get carried away with it. Sounds like you are shopping for a bargain so that won't be a problem.
745381,irishfield,2012-11-20 18:45:00,26272," And if you go.. let me dig for the best stores name. Bought Leah a 1/2"" wide herringbone once side.. smooth the other necklace in 1991 and went into the same store just 3 years ago to buy myself a new wedding band with my casino winnings and the owner of the store remembered us... as he only ever had one necklace of it's kind. Don't forget to ask for your beverage of choice in the jewelry stores down there to keep yourself occupied while the wife browses the counters!  They all have ""stock"" behind the counters or hidden in display posts"
745383,Freshtrax,2012-11-20 18:50:00,2215,Lol I'm headed down to golf the wife is staying at home!
745416,lookinforwalleye,2012-11-20 21:55:00,4399,  Isn`t that the truth!!!
745425,Rod Caster,2012-11-20 23:31:00,5784,"My wife worked at a jewelery store and knew that with my budget, I wouldn't be getting a diamond of any great substance...most of them are junk and way overpriced unless you have big money to spend. I have nicer pieces of quartz in my rock collection... Yes rock collection! Instead, I got her a sweet BIG, flawless pink saphire and she loves it and gets lots of ooohhs and ahhs type of attention ... Diamonds, at the low to mid range are a complete rip off and represent one of the most corrupt and marked-up markets on earth. For example : buy a diamond for 3000 and its appraised at 5000??? Think about that! Plus, 200 people between the mine and the seller have taken a 1 percent cut. YES my math is correct"
745484,Billy Bob,2012-11-21 11:06:00,5865,"Just one other piece of advice I would like to pass along.....  It might be different in Ontario/Canada or the courts could see it the same....  Down here the courts have ruled if you give a girl a engagement ring and she breaks off the engagement, the ring belongs back to YOU......HOWEVER, if you give her the engagement ring at Christmas or for her birthday, then it's considered a gift and then she can break off the engagement and turn around and sell the ring......just another reason not to over spend on a engagement ring....."
