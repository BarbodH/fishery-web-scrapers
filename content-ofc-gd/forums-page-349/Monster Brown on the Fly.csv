747904,GreenCanada,2012-11-30 03:54:00,375,"Thought I would just leave this video here. It isn't me, but I would definitely go head over heels for this bad boy, just like this guy did!  "
747905,SirCranksalot,2012-11-30 03:58:00,3291,"    You trying to stir up trouble here again, GC, posting that provocative pic?"
747907,GreenCanada,2012-11-30 04:04:00,375," Haha, you had me going at first! Thanks for the chuckle!"
747913,Musky or Specks,2012-11-30 04:24:00,2710,Not to stir the pot but flossing lake run browns during the spawn is not catching fish
747926,wallacio,2012-11-30 12:26:00,475," Exactly.   That fish was worse than flossed, it was snagged in the tail.   At around 1:20 you can see the tail lift as he raises the rod.   This guy has been roasted up and down on many forums for his supposed ""catch""."
747928,bushart,2012-11-30 12:35:00,2628,Looked really cool to me  I say beaut catch and nice goin  I watched the vid----looks great  I am envious for that beauty spot as well  Thanks for postin GC
747934,Rich,2012-11-30 13:05:00,3927,I see no evidence of snagging here. Just a big fish. Congrats to that dude. I think i'd jump in face first for it too.  And flossing a brown with a fly rod would be more challenging than just getting them to eat it. They're agressive as hell.
747941,Roy,2012-11-30 13:40:00,13728,It's a fantastic fish. Congrats to the angler. I'd take one half that size..especially in those surroundings.
747943,outllaw,2012-11-30 13:46:00,1232,what a beauty roy. i love browns
747951,solopaddler,2012-11-30 13:58:00,8605,"I've seen this video before, it's pretty cool.  I didn't see anything conclusive in that video that points to the fish being snagged."
747952,RangerGuy,2012-11-30 14:02:00,564,"That is an awesome brown!  I had big hopes of seeing one like that when I was on The River Test in England.  I don't think that was flossed, he's says right in the video that it's wrapped up in the line.  Fish of a lifetime, in awesome surroundings!"
747956,torco,2012-11-30 14:20:00,656,Watched the video a couple times no conclusive evidence it was snagged or flossed. Nice fish in some beautiful surroundings.
747968,BillM,2012-11-30 15:00:00,17367, Lake run browns in California?
747970,solopaddler,2012-11-30 15:02:00,8605,"  Yes, it's a trib of Lake Tahoe."
747971,BillM,2012-11-30 15:04:00,17367,I had no idea Tahoe had giant cows like that!
747972,Moosebunk,2012-11-30 15:07:00,3970,"Kudos to the kid!!!  Have enjoyed this video before.  In water that skinny, that big brown should have had a pretty good clue as to it's surroundings.  Don't imagine it would have eaten just any bug poorly presented.  If it took on a mayfly, that's wicked."
747973,bushart,2012-11-30 15:08:00,2628,I believe when I was a lot younger---the record came from there  Long time ago--when dinosaurs roamed da earth
747976,Meegs,2012-11-30 15:16:00,249,bigger browns in lake o
747987,BillM,2012-11-30 15:39:00,17367," Bigger browns in Lake Michigan, but who really cares?  I do however like the video editing (ie you never see the hook removed) perhaps because it's in the fishes ass?  /stirs pot"
748022,davey buoy,2012-11-30 17:39:00,5505,"Great fish,what a giant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Never a judge here;)."
748041,solopaddler,2012-11-30 18:12:00,8605," I think that was Flaming Gorge, pretty sure it was the hot fishery way back when."
748108,kemper,2012-11-30 21:56:00,2232,I can't believe nobody has mentioned the ten point dive and fumble recovery he used to land that thing! I laughed out loud when I saw it....just awesome.
748190,ChrisK,2012-12-01 02:03:00,2772,Nice catch for sure but I'm not a big fan of sight fishing. He did mention that the fish was bigger than he thought.... As for the landing technique  he kinda reminded me of a grizzly bear catching a salmon
