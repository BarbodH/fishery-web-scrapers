747678,hotsky,2012-11-29 04:27:00,400,Only fish I ever got at the Harbour in Hamilton was a salmon. I've been spending a lot of gas lately going to other spots so will likely be spending more time fishing close to home. What fish can be caught there this time of the year from shore? Do carp stay there all year long? Any chance of getting a pike? what lures or bait work the best?  Thanks
747690,Rich,2012-11-29 10:44:00,3927,"There is a strong possibility to get into a pike down there. Also some big perch, no good for eating obviously but big and steady action."
747691,Rich,2012-11-29 10:45:00,3927,And this time of year its best to bite the bullet and use minnows below a float or on a dropshot rig
747711,registerfly,2012-11-29 14:16:00,198,"let us know how you make out, should be warm weather this weekend. might take the yak out"
747716,Christopheraaron,2012-11-29 14:34:00,3525,Sent you a PM.
747720,BillM,2012-11-29 14:58:00,17367,Big sucker minnow below a float for sure.
747721,highdrifter,2012-11-29 15:00:00,2534, Bah that's your answer for everything!!
747723,BillM,2012-11-29 15:03:00,17367," In the fall?  Absolutely, lol.  Been slaying the walleye and bonus big pike with them since Oct."
747724,hotsky,2012-11-29 15:12:00,400,Thanks guys. Would dead bate or cut bait work too? what about plastic imitations under float?
747737,Christopheraaron,2012-11-29 16:05:00,3525,"Dead and cut should also work, maybe plastics under a slip float, but not just sitting there."
747903,hotsky,2012-11-30 03:52:00,400,Thanks guys. Is the Bay park my best bet or any other spots might be better?  This weekend I'll be in London so maybe Monday.
747908,northernpike56,2012-11-30 04:08:00,717,la salle?
747916,hammercarp,2012-11-30 05:39:00,964,Pier 8 for perch.
747936,Rich,2012-11-30 13:17:00,3927,Deadbait can be left directly on bottom for pike. its actually the easiest way to get a trophy this time of year.
747963,hotsky,2012-11-30 14:35:00,400,hey hammercarp whats carp fishing like right now at the harbour?
