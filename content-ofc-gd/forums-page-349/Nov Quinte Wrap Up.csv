746992,young_one,2012-11-27 01:20:00,620,"Bay of Quinte in November means trophy walleye! This year with hopes to finally join the double digit club, I trolled for miles and jigged until frozen guides.    Uncle Henry's driving had the best luck with eyes'   Hot Tiger   My dad spoiled with a 'smaller' fish   Dad with the net   Linc with a nice one on the LG Signature mods   Shad shape was huge this year.   Weather is great!   Dark male   Redeye' Shad   Skinny and hungry,   fat and still hungry!   One of our many released fish.        10.7   10.1 Jigging PB   11.7 Trolling PB   Tickle her a little before the release   Until next year... "

746995,Stoty,2012-11-27 01:26:00,2910,Congrats on the new PB's!! Some beauty fish for sure! Sorry to hear about the prop though... but good on you for marking it out so others don't hit it.
747001,Terry,2012-11-27 01:34:00,14456,nice going guys
747005,kickingfrog,2012-11-27 01:43:00,8333,A 10 pounder jigging would be sweet.
747009,Fish Farmer,2012-11-27 02:01:00,2234,"Looks like you guys hit it right on, congrats"
747057,Moosebunk,2012-11-27 06:13:00,3970,Quality and quantity.  Great Quinte fishing right there dood!

747073,b2kptbo,2012-11-27 12:47:00,1505,Looks like ya did pretty good Will. Thanks for the report...
747138,EC1,2012-11-27 16:41:00,930,I'd say your trips are almost worth it to skip out the simcoe pigmonkeys.  ... Next year I'll have to do the bladebait competition with you.
747141,Joey,2012-11-27 16:46:00,9122,"Some really nice fish there  Great report, looks like you all had fun"
747142,Harrison,2012-11-27 16:49:00,2202,"Nice Haul bud.  Spent a few nights in that launch parking lot over the years.  Nice job on the shad raps, next year give the Minnow and Taildancers a go..... they like'm even longer."
747143,Spiel,2012-11-27 16:53:00,9065,"Beauty report Will, congrats on the PB's and thanks for sharing."
747145,fishnsled,2012-11-27 16:54:00,3520,"Great report Will. Sorry to here about the prop, I bet I missed it by a few feet, if by that much going out from there. Thanks for taking the time to mark that, good karma coming your way for sure. Congrats on the PB's!!!!!"
747184,frozen-fire,2012-11-27 18:37:00,542,Send me the GPS coordinates of where the sunken treasure is! I'll go jigging for it!
747199,adolson,2012-11-27 19:18:00,783,Great job! I can't imagine getting walleye the size some of you guys post here.. Maybe some day I will get lucky.
747204,Jds63,2012-11-27 19:25:00,1365,"wow, they are really putting on the feedbag, nice looking fish"
747295,LeXXington,2012-11-27 23:02:00,1928,Very nice going..
747303,msp,2012-11-27 23:35:00,1336,"well done. Looks like some great fishing, and 10 #er jigging.....Awesome"
747366,ccmtcanada,2012-11-28 03:11:00,7971,Will...I'd say you had a great November down at Quinte!  Congrats on all the fish...and especially the PB!!
747372,young_one,2012-11-28 03:32:00,620,"Thanks everyone for the kind words! I can honestly say there was not a single trophy fish we caught that had a bladder problem, we never fished deeper than 30FOW. (Except for the small eaters at Thompson) Being versatile and switching tactics was key to our success. Most importantly, 2 rod zone is not always the best place to fish."
748245,woodro,2012-12-01 11:55:00,168,"Hey young one, I'm the guy you towed back to Picton bay a few weeks ago. Want to thank you again! I'm glad karma paid you back with the double digit PBs. Fyi We were able to get the belt replaced by 9 the next morning. Definitely didn't have the same results that weekend as you though."
