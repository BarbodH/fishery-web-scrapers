747387,WahooLodge,2012-11-28 05:38:00,11,"Spending money on tackles and gears over an already tight budget, not cool.  Getting nagged of going out too much and delaying house chores, not cool.  Finding yourself in leaky waders when you are standing in the water all set up and ready to begin, not cool.  Snagging your hooks on the bottom and having to cut line to let your favorite tackle go, not cool.  Getting yourself overly tanned or rather, sunburned, not cool.  Your fingers and ears feeling frozen, your feet all numb, and your body loosing all its temperature, yet not a single bite there, not cool.  All of a sudden, fish on! Jerk, set hook, your fishing rod is going sharply curved, VERY COOL!"

747399,Christopheraaron,2012-11-28 12:09:00,3525,"It depends for me, almost no one in my family really fishes and a lot of them just don't like it, but it is also nice to get out with family."
747408,Roy,2012-11-28 12:44:00,13728,This is a strange first post. It'd be nice to see a quick introduction from you. Maybe even a short blurb on what the point of this poll is.  Thanks and welcome aboard.

748191,WahooLodge,2012-12-01 02:13:00,11,"Thanks Roy for welcoming me aboard. The poll does not have any particular purpose. Just thought it might be fun to see how people feel about family fishing. I made the result public to share the fun with everybody. As for me, I run a small resort and love fishing too, only except that I do not have super fishing skills. At most, some street smart, that's all......or lake smart.  "
748195,WahooLodge,2012-12-01 02:19:00,11,"No, Skipper "" D "". That would be my dream job. Only I have some eye problems with that. I don't see myself having an opportunity to do that in this life. Maybe next life......  "

748267,Billy Bob,2012-12-01 14:03:00,5865,Last question not needed to be answered but it forces you to answer it.
748381,WahooLodge,2012-12-01 20:46:00,11,"no kidding fishinguypat. couldn't agree with you more. still got some horrible vivid memories about that. however, when it's only once in a while, and with your loved ones, it might be enjoyable. say, just consider it like a house chore, it can be rewarding. well...sometimes. "
748382,WahooLodge,2012-12-01 20:52:00,11,"Sorry for the inconvenience billy bob. If I knew how to change that, I would change it. Thx for voting. The more people vote, the more fun the results will be.  "
