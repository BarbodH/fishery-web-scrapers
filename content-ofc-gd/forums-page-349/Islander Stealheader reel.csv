746459,Paulus,2012-11-25 05:40:00,522,"This is really late in the discussion, but I have an old Raven SST that used to make grinding noises and still has some wobble. The grinding noise I eliminated by first changing the bearings - which I ordered and then changed myself - only to find that the new bearings weren't as good as the old. So a friend of mine - you may know him on this board   - suggested I dunk the old ones in kerosene overnight. I had nothing to lose, so I tried it. Once I rinsed the bearings and put them back in, the reel spun like new. The wobble was still there, but that's because I did fall on it probably a half dozen times slipping on river banks etc... but it never affected the quality of the drift - so I just put it in the ""live with"" category. Essentially, the fish don't care about it - so why should I   !!!  p.-"
746506,Ralph Field,2012-11-25 15:02:00,1018,"Remember the reel could have easily been dropped in the store before you purchased the reel. I have seen anglers drop reels on more than one occasion and Joc's store isn't immune from this. Easier for the store to sell the reel than send it back if they don't notice the damage. Your reel spins better than any Islander I have ever seen , so maybe you should fish it and just keep replacing the bearings every year."
747219,icefisherman,2012-11-27 20:27:00,952,"OK, Did a side by side comparison over the weekend with another Islander, swapped the spools etc. It looked like it might be the spool but the other reel has some (smaller) wobble itself so it is hard to say. In any event I took the reel and went fishing on Sunday and it performed much much better compared to before changing the bearings...It took me a while to get used to how nicely the reel was spinning when it was new... Spoke to Islander again today and we both agreed I'll keep using it as is and observe and see if bearing go bad again in the next year or so...then we'll speak again with Heather this time next year before warranty expires. She promised she'll take care of me should the wobble cause the bearing to go bad again. Seemed like a fair solution to me so I agreed. Now...time to put it to some more good use...need some good rain first though Thanks to all who commented in this thread.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
747529,Guest ----,2012-11-28 18:59:00,0, More true than you know. When I returned my bum islander the young salesperson who was swapping the line onto the new one dropped the one I was returning twice on the hard cement floor:blink:. It Happens.
745106,icefisherman,2012-11-19 13:55:00,952,"  I called Josh and went to see him at AO on Saturday. I am quite a distance away from him and can't be there in person too often. Specifically requested bearing replacement and he told me he cannot do it as he doesn't have them. According to him it has to be done by Islander. He recommended calling them directly which I'll be doing today. Knowing Josh I was hoping he can do more than that, even replace the reel with a new one, as he has done in the past on similar occasions...but he didn't offer. Anyhow...will know more later today after speaking with Islander and will post here. I also think it is most likely the bearings...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
745107,BillM,2012-11-19 13:58:00,17367,"I wouldn't expect Joc to replace a used reel with a new reel, that's a stretch.   I'm sure Islander will take care of you."
745119,SlowPoke,2012-11-19 15:16:00,2984,"He absolutely would if it was obviously defective; just like he replaced Emil's wading boots. The trouble is, he's not an ""authorized Islander repair tech"" (or whatever they're called) so he could be on the hook for the new reel if Islander deems it worn out or damaged. I had trouble with some reels a few years back and he offered to replace them with 'new and improved' models or credit towards another purchase. That's when I started my Tekota collection. He also replaced two trolling rods for me this year, no questions asked. Quite simply, he's one of the easiest retailers around to deal with... if can get him to stand still for more than a minute!!"
745125,icefisherman,2012-11-19 16:42:00,952,"Thanks Brian. You've said better than I ever could...  Now...just spoke to Islander (Heather is the lady Josh told me to speak with). Very nice lady...she wasn't too surprised with my problem...let her hear the spin on the phone (the ""draft"") and she said right away she knew about this issue and can and will fix it. Problem is I have to send it to them...(not unexpected of course)...I'll have to pay shipping to them...they'll cover the return...they'll void the $20 processing and handling fee they usually charge since it is under warranty, about 10 days for the whole process to complete...she said they are busy but will put my reel to the front of the line and prioritize it...so I am shipping it out today and hope no rain in the next 10 days so I don't fee too bad not having it and not be able to fish She said she doesn't see the benefit in upgrading the bearings to ABEC7...not worth the money for the slight improvement.... I've asked about the BOCA bearings...she said if I decide to put those on, I am on my own as they don't put other bearing but their own...and she said it could be tricky removing the old bearings and if I screw up something I'll have to send the reel to them to fix it and then put the BOCA bearings myself...anyhow...I think I'll just stick with them replacing the current bearing with the same grade ones (ABEC3) unless someone can convince me in the next day or two why it is worth paying $70 extra for the upgrade to ABEC7 while the reel is in Vancouver.  So far good service on the Islander side....hope I can say the same when I get my reel back....will post.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
745127,MJL,2012-11-19 16:50:00,2427,My friend replaced his Islander bearings a few years ago. He got AngSpec to order the bearings from Islander and Tom put them in. I think the total (parts + labour) was around $15-$20 for the Abec 3 ones.  I've been running my Abec 3 bearings since 1998 and honestly can't find a reason to upgrade to the more expensive barden bearings that Islander also uses. I have not lubed the bearings in over 12yrs with anything nor have I ever taken them out of the spool to clean. Essentially the only cleaning I have ever done to them was washing/spinning the reel in the river to get dirt and sand out of the backplate (if you can call that cleaning...)
745128,misfish,2012-11-19 16:55:00,29133,"  Im free this weekend Emil,,,,,,,,,,  Good luck with the service."
745129,SlowPoke,2012-11-19 17:06:00,2984," Sounds like a good CS experience thus far. I don't think you'll be disappointed. You'll forget all about the one-way shipping cost once you're back on the river. Ahhh, who am I kidding; you know the whereabouts of every nickle you've ever spent!"
745135,FishTracker,2012-11-19 17:45:00,47," I recently had to deal with Islander customer support (Heather as well) and I can honestly say Islander has some of the best customer support I've ever experienced.  They go above and beyond.  She was very nice and worked with me to get everything taken care of very quickly,  which is important - especially at this time of year!  I'm glad it's all getting worked out for you as well, Ice Fisherman!"
745164,Garnet,2012-11-19 18:58:00,2056,I think the OP has had this reel apart and then not loaded the bearings correctly. What ever tightens the spool against the bearings might need the smallest adjustment. Giver a spin and tighten/loosen.  This is also why going from 3's to 7's doesn't work most of the time. All the tolerances are for abec3 of this brand and maybe the 7's are slightly wider/narrow you can never get the bearings loaded correctly.
745194,davey buoy,2012-11-19 22:04:00,5505," Mike,I've only had my Aventa for two years,but one time I remember,a bit of sand or dirt got in. Just dipped it in the river a time or two and it was smooth again. Start up never needs help,and about protecting your investment,lol.,that went out the window.:wallbash:Thanks for reassuring again. Heard that a time or two before.:good:But I still have a cover for transport!!!"
745253,icefisherman,2012-11-20 01:28:00,952," Bought the reel new from Angling Outfitters one year ago and have never touched the bearings. In fact I haven never even opened it until last weekend and didn't know what is inside.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
745319,Garnet,2012-11-20 13:05:00,2056,Still think the bearings are not loaded correctly. Spend your money. I would try to adjust it.

746017,icefisherman,2012-11-23 18:58:00,952,"OK Just got my reel back. Islander has replaced the bearing as they agreed they were no good. The noise has decreased significantly. The wobble though is still there...having eliminated the bearings as a reason for it, I am now thinking (and Islander agrees) it is either the shaft itself not straight of the spool was not machined very precisely. No way to know for sure...unless I have another Islander that doesn't exhibit similar problems near by...then I can replace my spool with the other spool and see if wobble is still there it is the shaft...if not it is the spool. Spoke with Islander again 2 min ago and unfortunately they didn't do that experiment while the reel was there. So I'll have to do it here... Anyone here who owes same Islander Steelheader reel and lives West of GTA (Brampton, Mississauga, Oakville, Milton)? Would appreciate if we can do a quick spool swap to eliminate one of the  two possibilities. Please post of PM me. Thank you.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
746045,Ralph Field,2012-11-23 20:05:00,1018,"I'm sure that any tackle store carrying Islanders would allow you to test the reel ,if you don't get any replies."
746079,icefisherman,2012-11-23 21:37:00,952,"OK decided to do two quick video clips to show the wobble. Had to use my RGB video camera and transfer it few times but it does show. Pay attention to the left side of the spool where it meets the frame and you should be able to see it. With such a high quality reel this sort of wobble should not be happening...there has to be something wrong with the pachining of the spool...but will try to eliminate the shaft as potentiol reason first.  http://s28.beta.photobucket.com/user/chocho111/media/Islander%20reel/reel.mp4.html  http://s28.beta.photobucket.com/user/chocho111/media/Islander%20reel/reel1.mp4.html   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
746084,Kingsalmon,2012-11-23 21:51:00,107," Was the wobble always there since you bought it?  Are you sure you did not drop it at some point?  I noticed in the video that the spool in the body side is wobbling a lot more than the open side.  The only way that that could happen is if the reel was taken apart and was dropped on that side.  I do not think that a error that noticeable would leave the factory given that these are hand assembled and I am sure that they give each reel a spin test.  Just for reference, my islander does not wobble at all.  I don't think there is much you can do to fix that to new condition."
746086,misfish,2012-11-23 21:55:00,29133,Nice vid. IMO it looks like the spool.It seems to be the same spot every time .
746089,icefisherman,2012-11-23 22:07:00,952," Thanks for the comments especially comparing with your own reel. This is what I am missing at this point...I need to have one well working Islander in my hands to compare this issue... To answer your questions...I have never fall while fishing the river never throw my reel nor sit on it...and had never opened it until last weekend when I was checking the reasons for the noise. And you are right...the wobble is more easily visable on the closed end of the spool....this is why I think it maybe a bad machining job... The noise was what started my deeper investigation into this issue and then I noticed the wobble... Can't say for sure if the wobble was there a year ago when I bought the reel...the noise definitely was not...so I didn't have any reason to look into it closer...again until last weekend. My logic goes like this....  Most likely the reel has this wobble since the day I bought it but bearings were new and didn't make any noise so I didn't notice anything wrong. It is definitely not normal for this quality reel to have its bearings destroyed to such a degree just for one year, and mine sure were all messed up (islander agreed)...now they've changed bearings with new ones, but the wobbling issue remains there...so I am afraid the same order of events will occur again in another year...i.e. my bearing will get messed up again but by then the reel will be out of warranty and I'll be stuck to replace them myself and this issue will keep repeating itself for ever....same as your car's wheels not been balanced...earlier or later it'll screw your wheel bearings...  What could be done about it you asked...I asked the same question to Heather at Islander and she agreed we'll cross that bridge when we get to it...i.e. I need to do the experiment with a good spool from another reel and eliminate what is the problem...spool....or shaft...if it is the spool Islander will have to replace it...if it is the shaft they'll have to replace the whole reel with a new one as in both cases it is not my fault and the reel is covered with warranty. Plain and simple to me.   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
746090,SlowPoke,2012-11-23 22:10:00,2984," The spool appears off center only on the closed side. If it were dropped, I suspect there would be evidence of damage. The wobble isn't likely to cause any problems in use but it's probably the reason for the bearing to fail prematurely. I suspect its been wobbling right out of the box."
746099,icefisherman,2012-11-23 22:35:00,952,"And you are most likely right Brian. At least it is the most logical conclusion knowing what I know now. I was just too much of a rookie when I bought it a year ago to notice it...it was my very first float reel, so I knew nothing about it back then...and it was spinning nicely and quietly so it didn't raise my attention. Until the reel became noisy, and I became more knowledgeable about that type of reels. And you all know the rest from this post. Keep in mind Islander had the reel in their hands for 2 days and they couldn't find any evidence of any serious damage, dropping, etc. Usually if such a damage had happened it'd show not just on one side of the spool but all over the reel...  Just spoke with a good friend of mine in Milton who will let me do the experiment over the weekend swapping with his spool. Then on Monday I'll be ready to talk back with Islander and find a solution knowing what exactly is wrong. Can't believe the following though:  Not only they didn't notice the wobble when the reel was new before been shipped out  ....but they didn't investigate the wobbling problem further 2 days ago when they had the reel back in their hands...they sure have plenty of spare spools, tools and measuring instruments to nail down EXACTLY what is the problem. Instead I am left sorting it out myself now. Oh well... I guess I am the one most invested interest in it, so I'll do it.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
746102,misfish,2012-11-23 22:51:00,29133,"IMO You need to send it back,IF YOU FEEL YOU HAVE DONE NO HARM TO THE REEL.  Like I said,I see only the spool being the problem.  I,m no expert on the float reel,but I see a problem with the spool."

746398,BillM,2012-11-25 01:31:00,17367,"It's not the shaft, definitely the spool.  I'm still guessing a fall/door/whatever to cause that.  No way that would leave Islander in that condition."
744801,icefisherman,2012-11-18 01:09:00,952,"Bought one of the so very highly recommended Islander center pin reels a year ago from Josh in Woodstock. It did cost me good money more than some less expensive reels but I was told it is one of the better reels out there. Reel worked fine last year but I am noticing much slower spinning and humming noise when spinning it. The most it spins for is about 3 min and this is after quite the work out on my side. Pretty sure something is wrong with the bearings. Not that many parts inside anyways so it can't be anything else...not sure why those things cost so much...it seems the simplest piece of machinery.... I remember it been much quieter and faster spinning when it was new. Islander has 2 years warranty, so it is still covered...did major cleaning yesterday...oiled it...no improvement...took it to Josh today...he did the e same...no improvement...not sure what to do with it, but not impressed for sure with its reliability...I see on You Tube people spinning it for 10 min and mine can't do 1/3 of that...what this amount to is often when fishing the river I need to help it start releasing line by pulling my line by hand or by jerking the float...not ideal...Will probably try calling Islander on Monday to see what they say, but this whole thing is not making me very happy to say the least...also not thrilled with having to send it across the country and be with out reel for who knows how long in the middle of the float season. Hope some one has an idea/advise how to improve spinning time and decrease the humming noise that comes out of it. Thanks.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

744824,icefisherman,2012-11-18 02:44:00,952," Kemper,  It got me lot of fish since I owe it...probably over 250 bows over the last year. It bothers me not because it is not getting me fish but because it is spinning worse than it was a year ago. I tried removing the bearings but couldn't do it...they seem to be pressed in the housing...is there any trick for removing them?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
744825,kemper,2012-11-18 02:51:00,2232," I don't think they are pressed in - if I remember correctly Islander uses Loc-tite to secure them. If you're careful you should be able to pop them out using some type of dowel that will spread the force of tapping them out on the outer ring. In case I'm wrong, you probably want another opinion."
744826,Salmonidstalker,2012-11-18 02:51:00,265,Well taking pictures of steelhead lying beside your reel on the river bank/dirt/mud doesn't do anything good for the bearings. You may not want to do that in the future.  Send it back to islander and they will take care of it for you. They are very reputable and have excellent customer service.
744830,icefisherman,2012-11-18 03:16:00,952,"  I hope they fix this problem for me. Will call them on Monday and see what they say...what bother me is it'll likely leave with no reel for some time. Considering Islander is on the West Coast it'll probably take a week or two turn around time...not ideal right in the middle of the float season. Thanks for your input. So I'll ask them and see if they can guide me how to do the repair myself if at all possible.   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
744831,icefisherman,2012-11-18 03:29:00,952,"Been playing with it all night...here is what I've noticed...in addition to been noisy and slow spinning it also wobbles badly ....I have the bottom end of my float rod on the carpet and the rod laying under 45 degrees angle against my desk and spin the reel...only use the bottom portion of the rod for this experiment...so when I spin the reel fast the section of the rod that extends above the desk vibrates really badly...has to be something wrong either with the bearing or with the shaft....in order for such a violent shaking of the rod.

Since it is under warranty they should fix it for free, but if I were you I would ask them to upgrade the bearings to APEC 7""s while they have the reel. They will charge for the upgrade but it will be worth it. The reel shouldn't have a wobble unless you fell on it,as mentioned , or you forgot to use backing. Never try to remove the bearings yourself , as you will likely not be able to get it back together properly."

Does anyone have experience with using their warranty...do they cover shipping both ways? Hope the turn around time is within a week.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
744889,Rob,2012-11-18 16:50:00,467,"If your going to go with the abec 7's, then I would order them and replace the bearings. If the wobble is still there then more than likely you have a bent shaft. If it is out .001"" then the end of the shaft is out probably .003 to 004"". These are CNC machined parts and are designed with tight tolerances, so any damage, no matter how small is going to affect how it functions. BTW if you are dealing with a $600 reel, $50 for return shipping is worth the cost. Most company's won't cover shipping on warranty returns.  Rob C"
744898,Guest ----,2012-11-18 17:24:00,0,Sounds like the one I just returned. It was a lightly used one though and had old line still on it in the store with no backing. I'm wondering if that may have been the problem...good luck with it icefishermen....I kept my aventa for a back up to avoid any missed fishing opportunities if I have to send the islander in.
744900,Burtess,2012-11-18 17:37:00,901,Running no backing on an Islander shouldn't be a problem as they are machined from solid bar stock and should not warp.  Sounds like you got some crap in the bearings or maybe a bearing went bad.  If the vibration you mention is from a bent shaft they may fix it for you under warranty to be nice but that would be caused by an impact of some kind.  I kind of laugh when many talk about spin time.... my Purist 2030(an old one)spins for only like a minute but starts with very little resistance which is the important thing.  Burt
744901,BillM,2012-11-18 18:03:00,17367,"Total spin time is useless, how's the startup?  That's what you should be worried about."
744902,icefisherman,2012-11-18 18:06:00,952,"With so few parts this thing is really so simple...it can't be anything but the bearing or the shaft...in both cases it doesn't speak well for manufacturer's quality....Reel looks like new...no dents of any kind...barely even any scratches...I do babysit it a lot...so I am sure I have not landed on it or caused the shaft to bent...Actually I have never felt while fishing rivers, it has been used for lets say...maybe 20-30 trips or so....  Just removed all the line to see what happens...the spin time (as insignificant as many here may say it is) went down from 3 min to 2.5 min and the rod is still vibrating while the reel is spinning...so yes...no need to be a rocket (or reel) scientist here to determine something is wrong with it....  Something else I observed...while spinning it as fast as I can, I gently put my finger so it touches the moving and not moving part of the reel at the same time. I can clearly feel the wobbling on my skin as it touches the spinning part at each revolution...If I then spin it slowly I can actually see from the side, the inside of the moving spool kind of coming in and out against the static frame next to it...  The distance or gap, periphery wise though looks to be OK and not changing while spinning.... this is the difference in the diameter between the spinning spool and static frame...with my naked eye it seems to be OK there....  So based on those simple observations and experiments it seems the inside of the spinning spool is the one that is doing the wobbling, not the outside diameter...this leads me to think that it has to be the bearings allowing microscopical movements along/parallel to the shaft (not perpendicular to it)....or the spool itself has not been machined well and the inside of it is uneven creating vibrations when spinning....can't prove it without specialized measuring tools but this is what it seems to me so far....  It would have been nice if I had another reel available to temporary swap spools and see what happens...but no such luck...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
744908,Ralph Field,2012-11-18 18:52:00,1018,If the bearings are not seated properly I think that is another possible cause for the wobble. You can cause all sorts of trouble trying to fix it yourself. For reels out of warranty Islander charges $90 to upgrade to apec 7 bearings.

When c-pins start to get loud or grindy, it is usually that the bearing race are cracked.  Doesn't take much since they are highly hardened carbon steel. I've done my own on several Ravens without issue but is good to let the pro's do it and hopefully show you the first time around."
