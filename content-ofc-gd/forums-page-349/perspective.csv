I don't know if it's early cabin fever, but I received this email from a friend and in the spirit of goodwill and a reminder that we are on this site because we share a common love of angling. Regardless of our political beliefs, lifestyle choices or whatever I share this with all of you. Let's remember how fortunate we are and please consider this before you react to fellow members posts. Some of us may not be as articulate and may be a little clumsy in our attempt to communicate, so let's not take everything as a challenge to our personal beliefs. It won't be easy but my early New years resolution is to try to be more patient and not over react.    One day, the father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the country with the express purpose of showing him how poor people live.  They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family.  On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, 'How was the trip?'  'It was great, Dad.'  'Did you see how poor people live?' the father asked.  'Oh yeah,' said the son.  'So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?' asked the father.  The son answered:  'I saw that we have one dog and they had four.  We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has no end.  We have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night.  Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon.  We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight.  We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.  We buy our food, but they grow theirs.  We have walls around our property to protect us, they have friends to protect them.'  The boy's father was speechless.  Then his son added, 'Thanks Dad for showing me how poor we are.'  Isn't perspective a wonderful thing? Makes you wonder what would happen if we all gave thanks for everything we have, instead of worrying about what we don't have.  Appreciate every single thing you have, especially your friends!  'Life is too short and friends are too few.'  "
