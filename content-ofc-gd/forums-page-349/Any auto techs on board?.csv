748251,GYPSY400,2012-12-01 12:41:00,191, I've been a mechanic for 15 years.. Any shop I've worked at the apprentices did brake jobs.. Licensed mechanics do engine work.
747802,lookinforwalleye,2012-11-29 21:34:00,4399,"I am pretty sure I need a brake job on my 08 Liberty and it`s been a while since I actually paid for a brake job, just wondering how much I might be looking at $$$ wise, rotors and pads all around!  Thanks"
747816,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-29 22:52:00,10439,My guess would be in the $800-$1000 range. More if wheel cylinders or calipers need replacement or rebuilding. Don't know for sure as I do my own work.
747818,outllaw,2012-11-29 22:56:00,1232,"the rear pads go first on libertys. odds are its them. you can do the swap. rorors, pads yourself. 1.5 hours.. thats all 4 wheels. 350.00"
747830,Dan668,2012-11-29 23:17:00,1120,I did my explorer not too long ago. Good ceramic pads from rockauto and regular discs from autopartsway (one of those online sites..) costed me under 350. Did the work myself at my friends oil shop in under an hour.
747837,GreenCanada,2012-11-29 23:40:00,375," I'm sure you already thought about this, but what about giving a few local places a call and give them the general info and ask for a quote?  It would be useful, in addition to the responses you'll get here!"
747897,iFish4real,2012-11-30 02:59:00,386,I'd say...change the whole car
747923,krixxer,2012-11-30 11:06:00,274,pads and rotors were 170 for my uplander. (have a year on then now)  first time working on the uplander it took two hours to install them.  800 in savings over the dealer
747935,lookinforwalleye,2012-11-30 13:14:00,4399," Well I think I will pass on your advice, nothing wrong with the Liberty it's been a good vehicle."
747937,lookinforwalleye,2012-11-30 13:18:00,4399,I wish I could do the work myself but I am just not mechanically inclined and after selling the house this past summer no where to do the work.
747942,Skipper D,2012-11-30 13:45:00,1970,  Then Zip it up to Barrie tomorrow morning with the parts and i'll put them on ...
747944,outllaw,2012-11-30 13:47:00,1232,my liberty has never been for any warranty work. great jeep no issues at all
747945,Skipper D,2012-11-30 13:50:00,1970,"  did you not get the recall on yours .... we did about a month ago , ours is an 06 ................"
747946,davey buoy,2012-11-30 13:53:00,5505,   Now that's one heck of a offer!!!!!
747947,Skipper D,2012-11-30 13:55:00,1970,  You come and help me Davey and i'll slit the install money with ya ..........
747948,cuzza,2012-11-30 13:55:00,467,"Do you need rotors? If your pads are worn out then just replace them - any half decent local mechanic should be able to tell you what needs doing. If you do need rotors, don't go for bargain basement ones as you'll be buying another set again soon (voice of experience )  Price depends on the parts you use but $400 DIY and $600 done by an independent mechanic with non OE parts is probably a reasonable ballpark figure."
747957,Skipper D,2012-11-30 14:22:00,1970,"Just for the record i spent a few years in Torornto in the Speedy shop at Jane and Wilson , then became the manager in the down town store in Thunder Bay for Midus with three brake mechanics working for me . For over fourty years now i have been turning wrenchs , not for a living any more today but still for my self and freinds and any one who needs a hand with some thing when i have the time . If buddy here on OFC wants to pm me he knows how to hit the keys ........."
748021,cuzza,2012-11-30 17:37:00,467,"Wasn't calling your ability into question Skip, I started my reply before you wrote yours. That's a very kind of you to offer your time to a fellow OFC'r  I love working on cars - almost as relaxing as fishing"
748025,dave524,2012-11-30 17:46:00,4508,"  Got a recall on my 06, some rear end suspension component was prone to rust and failure. Same time one of the back windows wanted to fall, they did both free   as the window thing was a well known issue with them."
748026,outllaw,2012-11-30 17:47:00,1232,my liberty is an 08.. no recalls
748034,Fish4Eyes,2012-11-30 18:02:00,1022,"Most obviously don't know this, but it is illegal for anybody but a certified mechanic to change brakes"
748202,esoxansteel,2012-12-01 02:28:00,1307,"  A certified mechanic must have made that rule LOL,"
748209,irishfield,2012-12-01 02:53:00,26272,No doubt.. show me where that is written in stone. I don't believe it! (but willing to be edumacated)
748212,Old Man,2012-12-01 03:22:00,822, Well I guess they're going to have to come arrest me on multiple counts of DIY brake repair.
748215,Skipper D,2012-12-01 03:43:00,1970,  Better tell all the CT stores to stop selling brakes then ...... lol
748250,Billy Bob,2012-12-01 12:40:00,5865,What's next....a certified tire changer...  Skip....do you do house calls....next time I need something...come on down....
