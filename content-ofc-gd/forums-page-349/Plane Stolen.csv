748393,irishfield,2012-12-01 21:37:00,26272,"Read that in the Metro paper on Friday. Not sure why the warning... I'd really hope they try to fit'm and fly it! Also not sure where they plan on selling it... all of us in the business are watching for it. Container to the Eastern block probably, or it will be stripped for engine and misc parts and buried somewhere."
748394,jedimaster,2012-12-01 21:41:00,3472,Not everything stolen gets sold on kijiji.  I would think its going to be used or is pre sold. I mean people dont steal a plane and put it on ebay.
748395,BillM,2012-12-01 21:43:00,17367,Is it bad to want the thieves to try and fly this thing and end up on the bottom of Gbay somewhere?

748402,Twocoda,2012-12-01 22:06:00,4130,Plane for sale...some assembly required...  the wings might make for pretty awesome GROUP wake board ....seriously ..they stole a plane...do you honestly think they are going to heed the good advice of not trying to fly it?...
748404,ketchenany,2012-12-01 22:14:00,3229," Lots of bulldozers have gone missing in the GTA. A few years back they took one in daylight telling the people they were moving to another jog site. I had a bin stolen in front of my driveway, there was a dispute between two patners and during the night one of them decided to come and get it.  maybe an inside job on the plane, just saying"
748409,misfish,2012-12-01 22:51:00,29133,  LOL  I heard this story before.
748449,esoxansteel,2012-12-02 03:01:00,1307,"You will probably see the wings show up on some guys souped up rusted out Cavalier, with the 2000,00 sterio system, and the big noisy chrome exhaust extention"
748457,Canuck2fan,2012-12-02 03:44:00,1444,"If they stole it ""to order"" for the Eastern block gangs, them putting the wrong wings on it and trying to fly it would be the least of their problems... Failure like that, in organizations like those is not usually rewarded in a way anyone wants LOL."
