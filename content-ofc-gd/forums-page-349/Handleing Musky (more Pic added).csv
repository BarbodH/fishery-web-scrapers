747819,captpierre,2012-11-29 23:02:00,2521,Holy Cow.  That many bulldawgs!  Can't imagine what you spend on tackle?  Does your woman know?
748211,fishyfingers,2012-12-01 03:09:00,46,"Great post, lots of good info"
748237,Gregoire,2012-12-01 11:15:00,1397, Bulldawgs are cheap as far as musky lures go in my opinion.
748481,Marc Thorpe,2012-12-02 09:20:00,621,"Some great info and tips on handling and storage ,Kudos to all"
746149,Rich Nelson,2012-11-24 01:00:00,332," Sorry, I made it clear on the last Musky post (that mysteriously dissapeared) that its obviously not all St Clair anglers have bad handling practices... Unfortunately though, a lot do, including a bunch of the so called experts ( charter guys) And 2 out of every 3 are trophy caliber eh?  Have fun with your 39 inch trophys! Ha ha"
746153,Grimace,2012-11-24 01:14:00,2020,This is a really good thread.  Don't throw it down the toilet Bladeburner.  Your point is well made about the charter guys. Everytime I see a fishing show on St Clair with the charter guys torpedoing musky while still trolling it rolls my guts but if you paint everyone with the same brush you are going unfairly judge a good number of people.
746159,mistyriver1,2012-11-24 01:43:00,600,"Great post.  I've got the exact same stowmaster net.  I do alot of solo musky fishing and find the net will fit right into the boat cleat but I like your idea of putting it in the salty.  I'll have to give that a try.  Knipex are the best, I had those canadian tire ones initially but if the budget allows it get the knipex, way better and way easier cutting hooks."
746170,Walshskie,2012-11-24 02:14:00,58,The handle is long enought that i can put in 2 saltyies right across the stearn of the boat.  And knipex are the best one handed they can cut any hook.
746172,landry,2012-11-24 02:25:00,1005, I hooked myself so badly once with such a big hook that I was show and tell for the doc and nurses at the hospital. The boga was pricey but it really helps me control the fishs head and gain leverage when cutting or pulling hooks. I love it and don't fear hooks like I did after my injury. My friends have noticed it cut the release time considerably and it is so much safer. Great post btw. Thanks.
746174,Walshskie,2012-11-24 02:31:00,58,The hand with the hook in it is mine.  Just in case i brought my release to the hospital the doc had to use them. Tip if you do get hooked bring your hook cutters to the ER
746207,outllaw,2012-11-24 11:11:00,1232,"Walshskie.. great info.. . the comments that wanna bash l.s.c. , maybe you can comment on all the positive action.. with over 3 million folks that can use the lake as home water, dont you think l.s.c. woulda been deceased years ago. lol.. great thoughts and kudos to all that care"
746240,esoxansteel,2012-11-24 15:22:00,1307,"Again great post an info, as for the water temp issues with release, is very true, but each fish is different, and ive had fish in 46 and 52 degree water that took an hour to release as well, with proper musky gear, which usually is not an issue, spend the time with the fish, make sure it is able to support itself in the water, if it is swimming on the surface that is ok, still stay with the fish, circling it if you have to, to make sure it does not get hit by another boater, and do not leave the fish till it is ready and has taken off to the depts where she came from. This can take time, but you put the time in to catch the fish, take the time to ensure its safely back where she came from. Education by knowlegable anglers is the best way to ensure our kids and grandkids will be able to enjoy the fishing opportunities that we enjoy today, on that note i hope to practice my musky release techniques tomorrow."
746296,Walshskie,2012-11-24 20:36:00,58,"I just wanted to thank the guys that posted and shared their excperiance and knowledge, I know I learn a few things.  And proving there can be a open exchange of ideas and opinions on a open forums even if those ideas are different."
746316,Handlebarz,2012-11-24 21:26:00,3790,"Great thread Walshskie great tips and points you have there.  Some great points here about picture taking I try and turn the boat so the sun is behind the camera not always able to do it if its to rough out but something to keep in mind.  Get your rods and lures out of the way so you can take the fish out and put it back with out worrying about the hooks on the floor of the boat.  I have my camera on the base for my tri pod before I set my lines if I am trolling or before I start casting so I am ready to go right away. I also have the legs extended on my tri pod and the head of it angled so that all I have to do is put the camera on the tri pod and widen the legs.  I have my camera set for 10 burst/timer with 30 seconds this gives me 30 seconds to get the fish out of the net (no need to rush I start counting the seconds in my head and start to pull the fish out at about 22-25 seconds) and ready for the first shot then it takes 10 pictures over the next 10 seconds awesome for funny shots of your fishing partner.  The Brat was making fun of me so I tail slapped her   Dancing her life away with another fish   wedding picture   For my bolt cutters I attach them to the boat at the start of my day they are hooked to my down easter rod holders and can reach any place in the boat I use a 25’ phone cord that you can get a the $$$ store. It helps me to not worry about dropping them into the water I can let them go and get my hands out of the way of hooks when the fish thrashes.    For my net I attach a rope to it as soon as I net the fish this way I can work on the fish with out worrying about loosing the net and I also remove the handle before taking the picture I have had it in the way a few times and find this works best for me. I usually release the fish on the opposite side of the net but did not in this picture where you can see the net in the water    Boga grips I don’t use them and don’t really like them, as they seem to be used the wrong way to often. I like the idea that Landry had to help handle them in the net that is a good idea but to often you see many people doing the LSC hold as many like to call it.  I fish LSC and don’t take offence to it but know many people have not been here but only see the videos that come from the T.V. shows and think were all like that and start the chant about LSC musky anglers.  The T.V. shows sicken me I have had very heated words with some of these guys about there practice of release and care for the fish at the time I did not think it would go anywhere but in the last two seasons these big boats have started using HUGE live wells called FishThanks to help revive the fish after the fight then they take the pictures when the fish is revived and release the fish. Yes they still use Bogas and torpedo fish but what can you do other them talk to them???  I like to think that with the talks that friends of mine have had and public message boards slamming them for the way they handle fish it had some part to do with the changes they made. I know many if not all of them are very passionate about these fish but can not stop there boats for a boat side release and when they are running charters with 4-10 paid customers they have to keep the boat moving or clear 10 + lines each fish.  Im sure more will come to me but I just wanted to add this bit for now."
746317,kickingfrog,2012-11-24 21:37:00,8333,If the fish is coming out of the water for a measure a board like this great to have:  
746517,Handlebarz,2012-11-25 15:24:00,3790,I still use mt OFC board but have thought about getting one of them bump boards. Did you get that in Canada? I would like to get one for next year.

746552,Handlebarz,2012-11-25 17:23:00,3790,Thoes are the ones I have been thinking of but was looking to buy in Canada I don't know of any stores that sell them here. I was going to get one at the Michigan musky show but it was canceled maybe one of the vendors will have them at the muskies Canada odyssey in April.
746559,Sinker,2012-11-25 17:49:00,8692,"Some great tips in here. I like the idea of tying the net on, Mike. I lost one a couple years ago! That's a great idea!  S."
746597,mistyriver1,2012-11-25 21:20:00,600,"A couple more ideas and one already commented on earlier.  My boat came set up for Musky fishing, some guy named Lew owned it before me.   "
746609,esoxansteel,2012-11-25 22:04:00,1307,"Regarding the bump boards, you can take a 60 inch piece of green plastic watermain pipe, cut it evenly lengthwise in half, so you have 2 60 inch pieces of pipe now, cap one end of each pipe with Lexan, or Acrylic, and place a stick on 60 inch tape down the length of the pipe, with the 0 starting at the capped end, do the same with the other, and you will have 2 60 inch bump boards, and the musky will sit comfortably in the curved plastic pipe for proper measurements, you can also put a seamstress tape before placing the musky in the bump board for a girth if desired, there is minimal to no protective layer lost because of the plastic pipe, been partially submerged in water while measurements are taking place, and the pipe been smooth as well."
746626,Handlebarz,2012-11-25 23:10:00,3790,"I was looking at doing that with white PVC pipe then just cutting a end cap in half and gluing it together then sticking my 64"" OFC sticker on it bit the finished product would take up to much room."
746761,Lunker Larry,2012-11-26 15:01:00,122,Ref the comment made earlier on gloves. I use the nitrite dipped gloves. They're cheap and you don't get torn up from gill rakers and such. Also gives you a better more confident grip on the fish. I get mine at Princess Auto when they're on sale for about $3. SAIL also had them in a big bulk bin for a few bucks a while back. Very worthwhile having.  Saw them in the dollar store today for $2.
746791,mpt,2012-11-26 17:46:00,158,Mike P where's the like button on that wedding pic? Priceless. Can you land a small plane on those measuring boards?
746835,Lunkerhunter,2012-11-26 19:57:00,455,"another tip is keep your boat ORGANIZED!! i learned this one the hard way.... i was up on lake of the woods and had 10-15 lures out of the boxes and laying on the front of my casting deck. many were hung up on the front of it etc and several directly on the deck.  after landing a 55 inch muskie my adrenaline was through the roof. i shuffled all the lures off to the side so i could give myself room to hold the fish and release it etc. when i went to pick up the fish i kneeled down on a 9"" shallow raider and a treble went past the barb and i also got a magnum bulldawg stuck in my shin...  thankfully i was able to rip both hooks out as i stoked from catching my PB muskie but all of that could have been avoided if i put my lures away after using them"
746838,Lunkerhunter,2012-11-26 20:02:00,455,to help keep my lures organized when out fishing i cut out a bunch of spots on a bucket so i can just put the lures back in easily and still be able to keep them handy. also a good way to store bulldawgs and other lures like them  i have another bucket i put on my casting deck that i drop any lures into after using them so they can dry out and also remain available should i want to use one again that day.

747335,Believer,2012-11-28 01:08:00,40,Great net! Fish seem to stay right in there 
746010,Walshskie,2012-11-23 18:41:00,58,"First before I post I think I should tell a few things about my self.  One of the many reasons I love fishing is it can be done at many different levels of financial commitment, ranging from 25$ rod from and reel from Canadian Tire a lawn chair and a can or worms to bass pro with an 80,000$ boat and 1,000’s $ in gear.  It’s all just fishing.  I took aquaculture at Fleming for 2 years and I sent 2 summer guiding at Kessagimme, and have been a hard core musky guy for 15 year.  In this post I will use brand names theses are not the only companies that make these product these are just the ones I use.  With what a said first in this post musky fishing is different, this is not snobbery but if you respect the fish and want to do it right then having the right release tools is a must, and it does cost some money.( rods, reels and lures you send what you can afford but if you do it long enough you will end up sending lots of money)  If your just getting into it and you not sure you want to make that commitment, have a buddy take you out to find out if you like it or hire a guide join a musky club.  The right tools bolt cutters and long needle nose pliers are a must, there are other tools as well like jaw spreaders, hook picks and grabits, I don’t have them but I have been told they work very well. Tools that come in handy split ring pliers and long nose cannel locks. I carry back ups because I drop things.  Tethering tools to your wrist or the boat is a good idea.   A net or cradle, large enough to handle a musky, with a rubberized basket. Pick the one that works best for the size and type of boat or shore fishing that you do.  I don’t use a boa grip and I’m not a big fan of them   Measuring- a bump board, floating ruler marking on your cradle, and a soft tape for girth.   And a camera Before you even start fish for the day, talk with your fishing partner(s) about the plan on how to net and land the fish, if your net folds make sure they know how to open it practice. By doing this hopefully it eliminates the panic that can set in when a fish especially a big fish is hooked, it will also increase your odds of landing the fish.  I believe that having a plan and having everyone on the same page is the key. Ok you have the biggest fish you have ever seen in the net.  This is why I like a large net and salties leave the fish in the net and in the water while you get organized have your tools ready and handy.  Leave the fish in the net and in the water while you remove the hooks, if the hooks don’t fall out in the net I cut them it safer for you and the fish.  Hook are cheep.  Hooks are out measure the girth in the water if you want not all fish needs to be girthed.          Holding a musky slide your fingers inside its gill cover being carful no to grab the gills until they reach the notch in the lower jaw. Pinch your thumb tight against the outside of the lower jaw and against the pressure from your fingers.  And hang on.  Your other hand supports under the fish.  Vertical hold are NOT good for the fish.  Try to keep the fish as horizontally as you can.  If you are not comfortable holding a big fish or a younger anglers lay the fish across your lap it's better than dropping it.  If you are going to measure the fish have the bump board ready and wet, a quick measurement is all that is needed.  ¼ and ½ inches are not that important big will show up in the picture. Have the camera ready I like to use the sport setting and just fire of as many pic in as little time as I can.  (I’m not an expert when it comes to pictures so if anyone has advice please post it.)  Keep the fish out of the water as little as possible, if it is a PB or your fist musky and you want more pictures put it back it the net so it can breathe for a minute then take more pictures. Smaller fish I won’t take pictures of or measure.  Cradles are nice for releases the fish can rest while being supported or hold on to the tail and keep the fish up right until its ready to go you’ll know when its ready.  Now is the time for high fives but don’t take to long because the bite on and the windows are small.     I think the most important thing is to have a plan that works for your fishing situation that has the best interestes of the fish in mind.  I know things happen and fish die but if you are taking all precautions and have the best interests of the fish in mind then that’s all anyone can do   I may have missed something or you have different ideas please post them so we can all learn.

746026,Snidley,2012-11-23 19:19:00,620,Great post. Protecting them so other anglers can enjoy them is true conservation.
746027,BucktownAngler,2012-11-23 19:19:00,582,good post. thx
746028,Rich Clemens,2012-11-23 19:28:00,3131,"Yup Great Post.  The other thing I use are landing gloves.  Not sure if others use them or not, but I do find them much easier when lifting the fish from the net.  Hopefully to avoid dropping the fish as I maneuver her out of the net for a pic - and she decides to thrash around a bit."
746031,Gregoire,2012-11-23 19:35:00,1397,"A good detailed post. I would add that it is generally ok to take the fish out of the water for a picture, put the fish back in the net and take the fish out again to measure it or reverse that order. If the fish does not appear to be in obvious distress once you have removed the hooks than it should be ok in the net for a few minutes. Just make sure that your net is large and deep enough so that the entire fish can stay submerged while you leave it in the net. I find that it is handy to secure the net on the cleat at the side of the boat while you are removing hooks. That way you do not have to worry as much about securing the net. It makes it much easier. Removing hooks is a one man job. It is ok to have someone watching you while you do this, maybe telling you what hooks to cut, but I only want one set of hands in the net. Most of the time the person who nets the fish takes the hooks out when I fish. I find that the person who catches a fish is excited, and hook extraction is best done by a calmer individual."
746035,Walshskie,2012-11-23 19:47:00,58,  Great points I've had very experienced guys say they would like to take the hooks out only to reach into the net see all the hooks and teeth and say never mind you do it.
746047,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-11-23 20:10:00,535,"One tip about taking pictures (and could be forgotten in the excitement of landing the fish/in a hurry to get it back in the water) is to position yourself so the sun is in front of you, not shining behind you. Or you could have a crappy picture of your trophy and not even be able to tell it's you."
746056,Andrew Grant,2012-11-23 20:42:00,201,.
746066,glen,2012-11-23 21:17:00,2641,If you have lots of pics maybe you don't need anymore.  I shake a lot off in the water.  This would be the way to go if you forgot / don't have a big net.
746071,esoxansteel,2012-11-23 21:23:00,1307,"Maybe some guys on TV should gather some info before they pursue Muskies or any other fish for that matter, holding them out of the water for extended periods of time Just watched the Fish TV guys fishing LSC with a guy who guides there, and vertical holds with Bogas grips, were common on the show with each fish of any size been held out the water hanging off a Boga so the viewers could see that Leo and Ron can catch Muskies, im not sure what happened to some of the many fish that were caught after they were released but i have a pretty good idea. The net that was used was also inferior, and looked like a typical Salmon net, with nylon mesh, and a handle extention, and not the treated mesh variety that is preferred by most seasoned musky fisherman, to help protect the muskies protective coating, and to reduce or eliminate hook penetration into the mesh which helps to speed up the release, and is safer for the fish and the angler. It is rather alarming that a Charter guy who makes his living by taking people out to catch muskies, doesnt have the proper equipment to do a safe, quick and proper release."
746074,landry,2012-11-23 21:30:00,1005, I disagree. The boga is a great tool to be used IN the net to help unhook fish but it should never be used to lift a fish. My boga cuts down on the dehooking time considerably and keeps my hands safe. I hooked myself badly once and the boga has been a great purchase since.
746080,Walshskie,2012-11-23 21:38:00,58,"A boga used in that way and not to lift fish, could be helpfull."

746087,NAW,2012-11-23 22:01:00,4022," So you're trying to say that simply screaming ""PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE....PLEASE PLEEEEAAAAAASE!!!!"" at your fishing partner to net the fish is NOT the correct way to handle the situation?   In all seriousness though, great post, and great advice.  I'm glad you took Lew up on his request to create this post."
746092,BucktownAngler,2012-11-23 22:14:00,582, this is a great point.  keeps the hands away from the hooks and teeth

746101,Walshskie,2012-11-23 22:36:00,58,It is also intented for guys with lots of experiance to share and so we can all learn.  All ready I've learn somthing new about the Boga. That when its used in the net to help controll a musky I think in this way it could be very usefull tool.
746109,SlowPoke,2012-11-23 23:23:00,2984,"If I can add a couple...  On a deep hook, I usually cut the split ring and often find it much easier to remove the hook with the lure out of the way.  Keep eye protection in mind while using cutting tools.  Once the fish is in the net, disengage the spool with the clicker on or loosen the drag all the way off a non-clicker reel. This can prevent a hook in the hand if you or someone else bumps the rod.  Cut down and retie/crimp your frayed trolling leaders and using them for casting leaders. (Thanks for that tip Mike)"

746118,glen,2012-11-23 23:47:00,2641,Crappytire has the long pliers on sale right now. They come in handy on other fish too.
746128,cram,2012-11-24 00:05:00,1733,"Great thread.  Wish I had read this when i started fishing.  A couple of more that you might add - pay attention to water temps.  If it's really warm, the fish is going to be far more delicate and you'll want to really limit out-of-the-water time. - good practice in general is to limit out-of-the-water time to the however long you can hold your own breath."
746135,Rich Nelson,2012-11-24 00:22:00,332,"Great post! As for the boca grips... The cheap ones dont have a rotating handle which can also cause damage when the fish rolls in the net. If you arent comfortable handling Musky and feel the need to use a boca, use a good one with a rotating handle.  And if you need to weigh your fish, do it in a cradle or large net, and subtract the weight of it. St. Clair guys will catch on eventually...( when the fishery is half of what it is today.)"
746143,Walshskie,2012-11-24 00:41:00,58,Good one with the weighing in the net or cradle.  And the rotating handle on the boca.
746145,SlowPoke,2012-11-24 00:47:00,2984,And I suppose you can paint an entire room with one brush stroke? Catch and release took a long time to get where it is today. Proper handling and awareness will take time too. It's not just St. Clair; it's just easy to point fingers when 2 out of every 3 fish caught are trophy caliber and it attracts so many anglers.
