Just picked up a new 2013 F150 xlt 4x4 loaded for a steal...i dont get how you can discount a truck 17,000.00 off sticker and make money...but im very happy with my new ride....its one sweet machine.  Thanks Ford...now to see if its Ray tough....lol"

748236,fishindevil,2012-12-01 11:13:00,6254,Nice new ride !!!! That's the truck I was going to get and had my mind made up but with all the discounts plus my dads GM discount I saved an additional 5 grand and ford was going to match it but changed their mind so I went with a silverado z714x4 but I really did love to ford what engine did you get ??
748240,Rich Clemens,2012-12-01 11:27:00,3131,You did the right thing.   I also went from a Dakota to the F-150 and love it.   Patsy also enjoys driving it.  Now she wants a new Camero.
