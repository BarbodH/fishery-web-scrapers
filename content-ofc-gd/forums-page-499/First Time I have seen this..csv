612706,Musky or Specks,2011-08-16 21:17:00,2710,"Reminds me of that old joke...  A musky fisherman is casting along a shoreline when a women runs yelling and screaming out onto her dock.  "" My Dog!!! My Dog!!! A giant musky just attacked and ate my little dog!!!""  The musky guy looks at her ,pauses, looks at his tackle box,  ""What colour was your dog?"""
612707,Terry,2011-08-16 21:20:00,14456,"small dogs are ok but I find I have to put a stinger hook on their tails to get a good hook set  often they would swallow the hook, so I quit using dog  just too hard on muskie and we don't want P3TA jumping all over us for hurting fish"
612713,mercman,2011-08-16 21:54:00,7054,"  You kill me !!! Besides, cats come with thier own hooks built in"
612717,GBW,2011-08-16 21:58:00,8460,"hummm, I'm going to have to try fishing with a few rubber duckies this weekend then..."
612728,spincast,2011-08-16 22:57:00,3279,watched snapping turtle do that once to a larger duck - took a lot longer.
612820,ccmtcanada,2011-08-17 01:59:00,7971,"WOW!  I've heard of this happening, but never saw it before.  I second NOT showing this to my daughter!!!"

613121,mistaredone,2011-08-17 23:56:00,913,Man!!  I have always wanted to see that.
613130,NAW,2011-08-18 00:24:00,4022,That's wicked!  Never see that one before.
613252,hammercarp,2011-08-18 14:46:00,964,I guess that's why mallards have so many young. Like McDonalds ( over 1 billion served ) everything eats them.  
614000,express168,2011-08-21 14:40:00,327,"That was interesting, I once saw a seagull get hit by something on the surface while fishing Nippissing. Never saw the fish but assumed it was a musky, good sized bite off the side of the bird."

614118,Lokka,2011-08-21 22:30:00,32,The fresh water sharks of our lakes.. wow and I'm on board with not showing that to the wife. I wonder if those marshmellow ducks will work.
