614008,skinny,2011-08-21 15:00:00,442,The day starts out ok we meet at the right time and head out then i'm told one of the party needs to be back on land for noon to be picked up for work. Ok just smalll agravation but ok. we get bait and it's a bit more $$ than use to but not to much. then get to the launch I have never used before and they are not open a passer by says launch and catch the owner on way back out so I do. Boat in water runing great. We head to first area I heard of perch being get there no many boats but ok. in minutes we have first fish in boat good sized perch on my girls line. we continue to fish there for a bit but real slow. We move on and head a fair bit down (10 min or so drive) and try again same sort of thing hit right away then slow. looking at clock I decide that maybe we should get back a bit because of person drop off time. we just about get to frist fishing spot and motor dies. I mess with it the fuel is drooling out of the carb ( stuck needle or float issue I think) manage to get motor to run but at full out only just moves the boat but we are on our way and still lots of time for drop off. we limp towards drop area. motor smartes up a bit but far from right. we get in general area of drop but early we stop to fish. we put a few in the boat and we are close to the lunch/drop area. In we go for drop. I start looking for my sunglasses I can't find them look and look then I get off my seat and find the twisted mess. We do the drop and I mess with the motor manage to get the drool to stop seems to run not bad so we dcide to go back to the close area from the launch. we get out and catch few then back in we go.Now the launch is cement and on a beach so we come in my buddy holds the boat while I go get the truck and trailer. as I fight to back it in due to lots of parked cars around I mange to get the front pass wheel real close to the ramp wall and as i crank the wheels to adjut the trailer I hear a loud hiss. Yep thats right front pass tire hole in side wall. there was a small piece of t bar hidden in the little grass growning in a crack. Normally no body would be as close as I was to this spot I'm sure but hey why not me. so I unhook the trailer (ramp Owner will pull out boat and stuff with tractor). I limped the truck across the road and called my wife to bring spare from home (was taken out of box for room I never get a flat) I jack up truck and get it ready. my buddy moves my boat to the shore out of the way. as it sits there the waves are pushing it up on the beach. when the ramp owner is ready he hooks up to my trailer and my friend loads my boat up and they get it out of the water and as they go by me (working on tire) I see long black cord with gizmo hanging from rear of boat. Ok so now my transducer has snapped off from beating on the beach. Wife shows up with spare and get it all hooked up and on the road again. But even though all this went on I had a great day fishing total count of fish was less than 20 that was 4 lines in morn 3 in aft.  ok so need ideas on how to remount trandducer or glue it could use pair of tires for a ford F150 and I'm in market for good polarized glasses   We got home then set up for fish fry and here is the spread all fish ate was from previous trips there was perch pike and bass .
