I am going to be in Niagara for a day of fishing (hopefully) and would like to fish.  I will be fishing from shore, and I really dont care what I catch (aside from carp, no offence)  Bass, walleye, salmon trout etc. what lures/techniques are on, and where can I go from shore?  Any info would be appreciated thanks!"

613812,buick14,2011-08-20 11:22:00,741,"Left out the most important part.  Lower Niagara.  I've fished there before, but usually from a boat or at differnt times of the year.  I was just hoping to get a feel so I dont waste to long getting a pattern down."
613816,highdrifter,2011-08-20 11:58:00,2534, Guy don't waist your time at the Negra... Come fishing with me!!
613824,buick14,2011-08-20 13:12:00,741,"  LOL I woulda called you instead of posting this if you HAD a cell phone number lol  I'm going on a ""romantic"" 1 day getaway with the lady, which I may be able to slide in a couple hours of fishing if I'm lucky...."
613846,PickerelHunter,2011-08-20 14:46:00,100,The Whirlpool is always a decent place to start if you only have a few hours.  Haven't fished it much myself but heard the smallies get in there during this time of year.  Watch your step though!!
614081,buick14,2011-08-21 20:50:00,741,Wet a line for maybe an hour...nothing worth talking about.  Damn theres a lot of weeds down there......and a ton of gobies.  Didnt hook into that quillback I was hoping for...
