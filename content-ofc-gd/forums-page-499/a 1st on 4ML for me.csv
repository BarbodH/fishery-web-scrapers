So, what else am I to do when I'm on the lake and my wife is home with the kids?  That's right, GO FISHING!  I tried some new spots and new baits as well and I got me a 1st by doing so.  I got my 1st LMB on the lake!  All I ever find is SMB, walleye, perch and the odd musky.  I'll add the pic's when I d/l from my cell later on.  It's raining out right now but it looks like it's going to pass in an hour or so.  So, I'm getting everything ready and going to head back out again soon, cheers.  Geoff"
