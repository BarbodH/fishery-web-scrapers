614141,Joey,2011-08-21 23:42:00,9122,"Ya, looks like a mess.  Hope everyone is okay!"
614143,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-22 00:06:00,10439,Looks like they got a little work to do there.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A89SX02_gMw
614156,Grimace,2011-08-22 01:11:00,2020,I love that town.  I spent the better half of 2008 in the salt mine running a crane for the shutdown.  My wife and I became quite smitten with that town.  A beautiful part of Ontario.  The town square shown in the photos is very charming.  This is terribly disappointing to me.
614161,irishfield,2011-08-22 01:17:00,26272,Was some damage at Sifto as well.. waiting to hear from a buddy that works the mine..
614164,ChrisK,2011-08-22 01:22:00,2772,Now that was a little close for comfort. This thing missed our trailer by about 20k.The skies were looking funny today around noon hour so we decided to pack it in and head back to London early.
614169,Canuck2fan,2011-08-22 01:31:00,1444,"I was fishing in the harbour with my father about an hour before it hit.... Spent the time during the ""tornado"" at a families trailer about 5K north of town. We got lots of hail but didn't think it was anything major...  Until we headed home. I couldn't believe the distruction on the drive to get through Goderich on the back streets. It looked like the old Volvo plant was shredded pretty good."
614176,irishfield,2011-08-22 01:41:00,26272,Just heard from my buddy... he's on mine rescue stand by. He says that there is huge damage and most stuff on site is destroyed at Sifto.
614179,Grimace,2011-08-22 01:44:00,2020,That is awful.  Did everybody get up the elevator or are there guys waiting for power?
614181,irishfield,2011-08-22 01:46:00,26272,Not sure Dave....
614184,Grimace,2011-08-22 01:48:00,2020,"To the people who do not know,  the elevator that takes the boys down the mine is about 6 by 8.   You cram in pretty good.  I had to wait more than a few times to get out for a number of reasons ( mainly cable inspection ).  The mine's depth is about the same height as the CN Tower.  When you ride in the elevator the water drips on you, it is basically a cage with a plywood floor.  Edit spelling"
614187,Musky or Specks,2011-08-22 01:51:00,2710,My cousin is on the mine rescue team I hope everything is alright
614189,irishfield,2011-08-22 01:53:00,26272,Will let you know if I find out anymore. Got a reply off Drew's smartphone a while ago.
614192,Grimace,2011-08-22 01:55:00,2020,The towers above the mine run the cables for the elevator.  I remember going into the mine and the big inch and three quarter cables running the elevators were above us as we entered the side door.  If those towers toppled I can see the elevators being down.  The other way out us the bucket elevators for the salt and they too are run on cable the goes up the other towers.  I sure hope every one down there is ok.
614198,irishfield,2011-08-22 02:03:00,26272,Largest salt mine in the world... 1800 feet down and as far as 5km out under the lake.
614204,Grimace,2011-08-22 02:17:00,2020,Yup.  It is always 19 degrees down there.  The huge fans circulate the air.  When you are in the salt mine there is always a breath of air from the fans.  I loved bombing around on the Gators.  The choice transportation for the mine supervisors.
614224,splashhopper,2011-08-22 03:20:00,2931,"if u look at the pics of downtow,,, u will see a pic of my friends blue ford taurus with its trunk on the ground in the town square,.. he was in the middle of it all.... minor injuries... he is my trout partner up there  Prayer for Rob and his wife sue...."
614225,splashhopper,2011-08-22 03:22:00,2931,phone lines are intermittent.... and there is a smell of gas as of i hour ago...  texting back and forth with a friend there right now....  if anyione needs to reach someone there and can't.... please call me @ 519-808-9969 and my friend will go check on them for you...
614229,irishfield,2011-08-22 03:27:00,26272,One 61 year old confirmed dead at Sifto.. many injured. Looks like the elevator building is severely damaged from pictures I've seen.
614231,irishfield,2011-08-22 03:47:00,26272,Direct from site.. elevator IS down. One rescued from beneath using the emergency hoist. Sounds like a good thing it happened on a Sunday.
614233,splashhopper,2011-08-22 03:53:00,2931,smell of gas is still present downtown as of 11:45 pm....
614237,Big Cliff,2011-08-22 08:23:00,6899,"I have a friend that lives out near the airport right on the bluffs over looking the lake, haven't been able to get through to him, anyone know if there was much damage out by the airport?"
614244,Big Cliff,2011-08-22 09:59:00,6899,"Just heard from my friend, they are ok, some minor hail damage but that is about it. He did try to go into town yesterday to see if he could help but the OPP are not letting anyone in. Quite a mess apparently."
