613568,muskymike,2011-08-19 13:33:00,772,"So I have to go to Vegas in October. I have never been, neither has the wife. Where would you stay? Where have you had bad experiences?  I have specifically left out Bellagio, Wynn and Manadalay as they are all very expensive the week we are going down. I am trying to do this as cost effective as possible.  Thanks  Mike"
613573,Sudzy,2011-08-19 13:39:00,88,"I always go with the Mirage.  It's a good mid range hotel, nice rooms, casino, right in the middle of things."
613583,John,2011-08-19 14:06:00,2956,I would consider Paris Vegas too.
613587,craigdritchie,2011-08-19 14:15:00,1586,"They're pretty much all the same once you look past the window dressing. Within the same price range, there isn't a huge difference from one hotel to the next (meaning one hotel's $150 room is not much different than another hotel's $150 room). Differences are in the lobby, casino and restaurants. You can figure out what best floats your boat from each one's website.  Location can be a factor. Mirage, Caesar's, Treasure Island and the Flamingo are all located midway along the strip, while MGM, Luxor and Tropicana are all clustered toward one end along with New York New York, Paris Las Vegas and the Hard Rock. Wynn and Encore are located toward the other end of the strip, with Circus Circus, the Riviera and a few others. Where to stay depends on who has the best deal at the moment, then what you want to do and where you want to go once you get there. If you want to golf, suck up the extra cost and stay at Wynn, since it's right on a good course. If you want to casino-hop, then any of the hotels clustered around the MGM or Mirage will work. All the hotels have pretty big casinos. People tend to hop from one to the next, rather than staying the whole night at their own hotel.  Once you pair it down to to or three possible hotels, look them up on Trip Advisor and read what other people had to say about them. That's a great site for checking out restaurants, too.  There's a monorail that runs long most of the strip, sort of behind the hotels on the MGM / Flamingo side of Las Vegas Blvd. If you're just going up and down the strip, it's cheaper and faster than a taxi. Most people just walk everywhere.  If you want to see shows, do a Google search on what's playing during your trip and buy the tickets now. The good shows often sell out weeks (or months) ahead of time. I've seen some amazing shows in Vegas, including Rodney Dangerfield doing standup, and David Lee Roth with a bluegrass band.  If you have time, you can take a side trip to fish Lake Powell. You can find guides on Google. Largie fishing is pretty good."
613589,mercman,2011-08-19 14:20:00,7054,"Depends on what you and the wife like. So far, i have stayed at the Rio, and Treasure island.I won more at Rio though If i had it to do again, i would stay at Caesars, if only just for the history behind the place.  What ever you do, take the time to see the grand canyon. It is unforgetable.  Eagle Point     You will enjoy yourself"

613657,muskymike,2011-08-19 18:22:00,772,Thanks guys. Keep the opinions coming if possible. Thanks Craig for the detailed response.
613675,Rattletrap2,2011-08-19 19:27:00,1652,"I was there last week and we stayed at the Flamingo. The room was reasonable, but everything else was expensive! IF I was to stay in this hotel again, I would insist on one of the renovated rooms. Ours was clean enough and comfortable, but a little dated. The carpets are in need of changing. They are redoing all the rooms and we just happened to get an older one.  Things have changed a lot since we went there last. 11 years ago, food was cheap. Today, the food is way over priced. A glass of orange juice is $6. a bottle of water is $4. A $3.99 breakfast at home is over $13.00 plus coffee ($4) and juice.  I did not get to do any tours, but if I ever go back, I will definitely make time for the grand canyon.  It was between 108 and 112 deg. F every day...which is just ""stupid hot"" in my opinion!"
613677,Big Cliff,2011-08-19 19:37:00,6899,"Just book it through a travel agent as a charter, you'll save a lot compaired to trying to book everything yourself. Any of the hotels are going to be good and to be honest with you about the only time you are going to spend in your room is to sleep so as long as it is clean, safe and quiet, the room shouldn't be a big concern. We have stayed at many of the places on the strip over the years and haven't been disapointed yet. You should be able to get a package with air and hotel for $600.00 or less/ person for a week. Air fare alone is going to cost you between $400.00 and $700.00 per person if you book it your self."
613678,Harrison,2011-08-19 19:42:00,2202,Best bang for you buck and locale is the Imperial Palace IMO.
613682,Whopper,2011-08-19 20:17:00,2174,"Phil is correct, stayed there a few years back. Clean & reasonable. Right in the middle of the strip."
613684,woodenboater,2011-08-19 20:25:00,2277,"I stayed at the MGM Grand during a UFC fight and it was packed, well probably woulda been packed regardless. Close enough to stuff and the monorail line ends at the Grand if you wanna get around. Try and go to Battista's Hole in the Wall, kinda packed with tourons but fun place for dinner one night. Did I mention you get a free glass of home made wine ?"
613687,Canuck2fan,2011-08-19 20:39:00,1444,"If you can stay at any of the Harrah properties they are the only ones who don't kill you with extra ""fees"" over and above your package. I stayed at the Flamingo last Sept and it was just a hotel room, nothing stood out except the view of the Belagio water show, and nothing was wrong with the room either. It was about the cheapest and it is centrally located. I wasn't there to spend a whole lot of time in the room so I really wasn't fussy LOL.  As for food on one of the days if it is still available get the 24hr pass for the Harrah buffets it was 29.99 per person. You can eat at any buffet in any of their hotels for a full 24hrs. Even the woman with us who ate practically nothing said she wished she had of went that way as it would have been cheaper.  Another tip buy your booze at a liquor store and just carry it into whatever casino you want to play at.... Nothing better than seeing someone mix up a double rye and ginger in a glass before we headed next door to Bill's gambling hall for steak and eggs for 6.99 at 4am before turning in LOL. Which is another tip look to eat between midnight and 6AM all the hotels and a few spots on the strip have EXCELLENT deals on some items them.  If you have a car rental definitely go to a walmart and stock up on beer, pop and water as soon as you get there. Buy twice as much as you think you might need!!! Add a large plastic container. Back at the hotel just fill the container with ice from the machine and use it chill your beverages. This simple trick saved 3 of us about 60 dollars in 4 days, because if you are outside for any length of time you are going to be thirsty.  There are tons of ""free"" events. The lights on Fremont, the fountains at Belagio, lions at MGM, the fish tank at Mandalay Bay. Be sure and drop by the gun store, The Pawn store which is just down the strip, and if you have a car check out the place where American Restoration is shot. Also go to a place called the valley of fire awesome rock formations.... Again if you go driving out of the city take tons and tons of water and soft drinks you won't regret it."

613705,Machine57,2011-08-19 21:42:00,22,"Mirage is centrally located, and overall we walk everywhere we go. The Transit system is a great way to get from each end of the strip. The Duece goes up and down the strip, and the Cat goes in the opposite direction to the strip. You can usually buy a 24 hour pass which is cheaper than paying per ride, and you get a transfer from the driver if you wish to travel the other direction. There is a Walgreens at street level between the Venetian and the Polazzo. This is the closest drugstore/groceryette per say. We bought our water by the case there, chips eats and other things and took them back to our hotel room. Waaayyy cheaper than the $4.00 pops on the hotel floor. There are not alot of free wireless spots. You can pick up a free wireless signal outside the coffee shop at the second level of the Polazzo. Other than that there is the Apple Store in the FashionPlace Mall right across the street from Treasure Island. TI is defenately worn down, and needs a makeover.  Beware of the guy in the electric wheelchair in front of the Bellagiofor the night time fountain shows. He makes ballon hats, animals ect, letting on there is no charge then whacks you for a ""donation"". As for shows, Terry Fator at the Mirage was awsome, not only is he a ventrilliquist, but also an impersonator. Jersey Boys at the Polazzo was spectacular, if your into Franki Valli and the Four Seasons. I'm not heavy duty into them, but sure enjoyed his life story and music. There isn't a bad seat in any of these theatres, so don't pay big huge bucks for premium seats. The Cirque de Soliel shows we saw, were Mystyre at Treasure Island and O at the Bellagio. Both were excellent shows and well worth the ticket price. Once again, in these two theatres there isn't a bad seat in the place.  Make a trip one night down to the old strip ""Freemont Street"". The light show runs every hour on the hour, and Tony Romas located down there has the best ribs. There are lots of locals hanging out there as well as some very talented street artists, overall a good night out people watching!!  That's about it in a nutshell from here in Barrie!..Have fun, we certainly do, people watching, walking, relaxing and taking in the shows."
613709,misfish,2011-08-19 21:56:00,29133,"For what your going to pay to get there and stay and eat and all that other stuff,wouldnt renting and RV(THE SMALL ONES) be a better savings, and you can travel and see much more then being stuck in one hotel?   Just a thought.   Im not sure if your a poker player,but if I heard there was a tourny going on,I could stay there all day and watch."
613774,Blue Lk,2011-08-20 01:34:00,337,"I have been to Vegas a few times & allways stayed on the strip,Treasure Island,MGM etc. Next time we will stay downtown in old Vegas(Freemount ST,sp?)I found that the casinos are just as good,allthough smaller I made more $$ downtown as compared to the fancy strip hotels,the food is cheaper,the booze is cheaper(BIG +). The Golden Nugget,4 Queens & Binions are all clean modern hotels with all the ameneties you need,good rates too. If you opt for a strip hotel take the bus downtown,you will see what I mean. The light show on Freemount is outstanding,lots of shopping & stuff to see You can allways take the Duece (public transit) to the strip to see how the other half lives IMHO Have a great trip whatever you decide"
613809,Billy Bob,2011-08-20 10:35:00,5865,"MuskyMike,  We have been to Vegas 6 times and plan to go back again in April.....we have stayed 4 times at MGM and twice at Excalibur....the lobby at MGM is the best IMHO....HOWEVER, the resort fees that ALL MGM properties (half of the strip) is way out of hand....whatever the rates are that you are quoted add about $20 per night once you  arrive......now Harrah's properties which own almost the other half of the strip don't charge resort fees.  If you book directly with the hotel IN Vegas and find a better rate later on you can cancel and rebook without losing any money, even at the same hotel. This is NOT possible with a travel agent or even a online agent like Expedia, etc.....  Also if possible find a direct flight to Vegas.....Southwest is the only direct flight out of Buffalo.  You mention you ""have"" to go to Vegas so I'm thinking it's a work related trip...but if not hotel rooms in Vegas are the most reasonable Sun thru Thursdays....  If I knew more what you like to do I could recommend more....like cheap Black Jack with good cocktail service or do you want up scale eating, etc....PM me if you care to pick my brain.  Bob"
614021,muskymike,2011-08-21 15:41:00,772,"Just want to again say thanks for everyone's input. I think we have made our decision and are going for much longer then I want to. 6 nights, 7 days. Mind you, we are going for a weeding so 3 or 4 of those days are completely occupied already. This will give me and the wife some time to go explore things like the dam and the canyon as well as take in ""O"" one night.  Somehow it is cheaper for us to go for 7 days then it is for us to go 5. Its actually $70 cheaper to go for longer per person.  I think we are going to stay at Tropicana, it seems to be the best price/location. Plus we have a few friends already booked at the Tropicana and we are going the week of the larges Dental convention in North America (55,000 dental professionals will be there so all the prices are jacked for our week)  Again, thanks to all, all your input is valuable and appreciated."
614128,Lokka,2011-08-21 22:59:00,32,"with so many homes in forecloser down in Vegas, you should just buy a home  might be cheaper. Vegas was great when i went there. Always something to do.. Have fun"
614151,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-22 00:23:00,10439, Can't you just stay at home and weed your own garden a lot cheaper?
