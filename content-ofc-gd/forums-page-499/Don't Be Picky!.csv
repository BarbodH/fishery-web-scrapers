We weren't interested in chasing down a trophy fish, just getting out and catching something. Took the 7 minute drive to the 'practice pond' where billions of little carp live. Sure enough, in an hour & a half we had caught 7, lost at least 5 more. Great times, even though the fish were tiny, they were scrappy and on the bite!            Good times. I don't love musky, pike, bass, trout, carp, etc... I just love fishing."
614318,fishnsled,2011-08-22 13:57:00,3520,Me too Rich. I doesn't really matter what you are fishing for. It's just getting out and having a break from the daily crap. I was fishing for panfish with my buddy and his 2 boys on the weekend. Had a great time watching the kids reeling them in.  Thanks for the report Rich.
