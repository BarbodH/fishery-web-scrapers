613634,dks,2011-08-19 17:17:00,36,"I used to think that canoeists and campers didn't litter as much, but, after seeing garbage at portage access points and picnic stops I've come to the conclusion that there is a segment of the population that either don't care or aren't aware that littering is unacceptable. There are litterers in every segment of society. Some more than others I'm sure. Best thing we can do is to point out to litterers that it is not acceptable. Speaking up will make a difference."

613858,4x4bassin,2011-08-20 16:02:00,1025,"A couple months ago I was driving to work through Hockley Valley and I was following a cadilac suv when all of a sudden out the window comes coffee cups and paper bags with who knows what's in them , I see it is 4 teenagers and I would assume they were heading home from Wasaga.I was able to get along side of them at the next light and I proceded to explain to them that the roadside is not a garbage dump , well to my shock the kid driving the suv told me off and the passengers all flipped me the bird ! Well that didn't go to well with me so I got there plate # and phoned the cops. The dispatcher took down the info and said thanks. About 5 minutes later to my surprise an OPP officer called me back and said that she was disgusted with the litering of roadsides in our area (Caledon/Dufferin) and was going to pay the owner of the truck a visit (it was in her district) and remind them that the roads are not garbage dumps or she was going to catch them on the road and possibly issue a ticket ! I guess this punk won't be going to the beach in daddys caddy any time soon !!!!!"
613278,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-18 16:19:00,2690,"Just got back from lunch.  Sitting in my truck at a Walmart parking lot in Kitchener, watched not one, but two, people just toss their garbage on the ground. The first ""person"" (I use the term loosely) bought a couple of car mats, tore the packaging off then proceeded to just toss it.  As he was climbing into the vehicle, he reached into his pocket and pulled out what looked to be a receipt AND threw that as well!!! Second ""person"" got out of his Jeep with his better (let's hope so, anyways) half, reached into his vehicle, pulled out a Tim Horton's cup, AND (YOU GUESSED IT) threw it on the ground under his vehicle.  Now there are only about three garbages in front of the Walmart that he proceeded to walk into. So for all the garbage we see ""anglers"" (I use the term loosely) leave lying on riverbanks, lakes, etc, it doesn't just happen there.  By the way, I wish I could have stayed to see the look on ""Jeep Boys"" face when he came back to find his Timmies cup under his windshield wiper!!!!!!!!  Rant done, AMEN!!"

One can only shake their head and wonder what, if anything, is going thru their heads during this senseless act.  I am avid outdoorsman who loves the peace and beauty of nature. On more than one occasion I have stumbled upon make shift dumps in our provincial parks from some lazy camper not wanting to pack out what they pack in.  Im not sure how some people can go to enjoy the pleasures if nature whether it's fishing or canoeing and destroy it at the same time.  I can only hope to come across one of these sub humans in the act.  There is no excuse for littering period. Bill"

My aunt just said to her ""Go ahead and do it, but you're cleaning it up!"" She preceeded to walk over to the garbage can and throw it in before leaving.

Prior to downsizing to an apartment, the puppies and I had a great sideline. On our morning walks we would pick up all the cans and beer empties littered all over the neighbourhood, and at regular fishing holes. That was over 1000lbs of aluminum a year. Would pick up enough beer empties in a year to pay my gas for a round trip to Florida. Truth is the problem has been around a long time, but there are more people littering and fewer caring.  On a side note, the tally of beer empties to date, in the neighbourhood and fishing spots, is $175"

Because those in power don't care either....this is downwind of the Eldee municipal landfill, no more than 50 meters away from a large creek that flows into the Ottawa River 200M downstream. All it takes is a tall fence on the windy side to stop this, I found this looking for trails, you can't tell me the MOE doesn't know about this. This mess covers an area of approx. 500 square meters, if not more. I've seen some disgusting things in my days and have become a little apathetic (unfortunately) but my GF was completly floored by this mess. Now she hates landfills and tries to recycle everything...hahah even things that aren't recyclable. Bless the girl for trying.  "
