613053,GBW,2011-08-17 21:53:00,8460,"Hey all.  A few of you here and I have gone fishing from time to time.  it could have been BOQ, my folks cottage or any trib any time or any lakes close to home.  So, anyone of you care to get out for a bit at my folks place on Sat. for a bit?  I have some things to do to help around the house before I go up and then at the cottage so I plan to be there before noon.  I'm going to fish from noon'ish till dinner, then right back out for as long as I can.  Sunday I am booked up in the afternoon but if you can make it by 7:30'ish AM (  ) then maybe we can get out for a bit as I have to be back by lunch for company.  Let me know if it's worth the drive and time for you to get out for a bit, cheers.  Geoff"
