612125,cynmar,2011-08-14 21:12:00,169,"Well woke up this am and decided wanted to wet my line. Was going to go to Mountsberg and as I don't have a boat, do some shore fishing. Well went to Mountsberg main gate and they don't open until 8:30 am and I'm there at 6:30 am after dropping off my daughter at work. Wife and I say, we'll go to Burns and play around.  No, not that, anyway end up catching 3 x 1-2.5 lb. small mouth using a 5"" Senko wacky rigged. I was pleased to come up with anything because the water level was quite low. Only irritating thing was the gentleman who came and started casting right beside me after I caught the fish. I'd reel in, he'd cast to the spot just next to where I had cast to. Kept moving from one side to the other of me. Finally left though, after I caught a fish with him standing next to me.  A morning well spent, saw a white egret which was a surprise, snapping turtles, herons, ducks quite enjoyable.  Bill"

It is heavily weeded but the park is small, nice and great for the kids to enjoy. I do recommend it for the kids sake, they wont be disapointed if they were fishing from the deck"
612226,pikehunter,2011-08-15 09:12:00,1659,"Used to go there many years ago as it was stocked with trout in the spring...and it was free. Wife and I walked in there one opening weekend way back when. It was crowded, had to squeeze in near a gang who were on a days picknic/bbq and fishing. We weren't in their back pocket or anywhere near that close. Asked how things were, answer was not a bight or nibble all morning. My wife tosses her line in with a piece of canned corn on the hook and soon as the bail was set BAM. She landed a nice size trout! Man were they ever pissed!"
612368,ufish2,2011-08-15 18:35:00,15,I have never been to Burns.  Do they charge to enter or for parking?  kids would love to catch some bass or trout.
