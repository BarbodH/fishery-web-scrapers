613802,Lokka,2011-08-20 04:23:00,32,"it's true, someday we will rule the world..... of warcraft"
613805,Billy Bob,2011-08-20 10:04:00,5865,VERY GOOD description of my favorite foreign country......BEST part...no Disco phase...
613807,Billy Bob,2011-08-20 10:07:00,5865,"OH, one more thing....if anyone takes us over I hope it's you guys....I already know the Canadian language....eh..."
613826,mercman,2011-08-20 13:20:00,7054,"  Hate to tell ya Bob......but you are already Canadian. If you stay here for more tha 2 days, we enter your pores and invade your nervous system"
613832,Billy Bob,2011-08-20 13:47:00,5865, My youngest son Billy was conceived at the French River 26 years ago...does that make him Canadian...
613834,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-20 13:52:00,10439, It depends. Did you have any maple syrup that day?
613835,Billy Bob,2011-08-20 13:57:00,5865, Thinking back there is a very good possibility that I did in fact have some Canadian Maple syrup....the Sand Beach Lodge serves a full breakfast in their American Plan.....huh....so you're telling me that since I went with the American Plan my son might be Canadian....and he just married a girl that has some French Canadian in her......my god the horror....  :rofl2:

613873,mercman,2011-08-20 18:08:00,7054," Take off eh.... That would explain your preference for Canadian beer, and your dislike for paying taxes Bob.Now if only you could make a good Poutine, you could come live here in Montreal and fit right in."
613876,mercman,2011-08-20 18:15:00,7054,"  Too funny...I like the Invasion plan  1. Launch Canadian space station ""Bombardier1"" into orbit. 2. Use space station to electronically destroy the entire world's communication systems, with the exception of the CBC, CTV, Newsworld, YTV, CanWest Global, CityTV, MuchMusic, TVO, BBC Four, and Fox on Sundays at nine o'clock.  3. Broadcast own political agenda and propaganda on new worldwide station -- Can-O-Vision.  4. Broadcast ""Heritage Moments"" and ""Hinterland"" spots every 15 minutes.  5. Invite Peter Mansbridge to execute the turncoat traitor Peter Jennings. Show execution on live tv.  6. Kill the VJs and crew of MTV and feed their corpses to the VJs and crew of MuchMusic.  7. At the end of every broadcast day, force viewers to watch a montage of patriotic video images, as selected by the Generals and including several tyrannical subliminal messages of sublimation to Canadian World Domination. Failure to watch will result in electric shockage from the Ever-Vigilant & Omnipotent (EVO) space station ""Bombardier1"".  "
