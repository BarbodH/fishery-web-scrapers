I've heard/read that the fishing in the main lake (Mazinaw) can be pretty tough. I'll only have access via canoe. Any decent spots to focus on? I'm also curious to know about the small lake where they rent canoes from. I believe it's called Joe Perry Lake. I've heard that the bass/pike fishing in there is fairly decent, but would like someone with some experience on that lake to confirm!  Thanks in advance for any help!  Cheers,"
614074,bucktail,2011-08-21 20:22:00,1857,You got the right idea. Mazinaw is toough but the back lakes usually make it worth the trip in worthwile. My buddie was in the back lakes last year and did ok on bass. Ill try to get you some info tomorrow when I see him at work.  Darren
