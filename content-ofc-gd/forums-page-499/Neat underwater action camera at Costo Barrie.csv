613996,Canuck,2011-08-21 14:24:00,491,"I was at Costco in Barrie Friday and bought a cool action camera for $199.  It does full 1080P video at 30fps and 720P at 60fps.  Its waterproof to 60 ft and comes with several mounts.  Its a plastic body and plastic mounts, but so far the quality of video looks really good.  It uses micro SD storage (same as most new cell phones)  I haven't tried it for fishing shots, but I would think it would be neat to mount on a pole and stick it in the lake to film the fish coming to the boat.  The lens is very wide angle so you don't have to be precise with aim.  This thing is going to be fun.  Here is a link http://us.oregonscientific.com/ATC9K/"
