Ingredients 1/4 cup maple syrup 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 clove garlic, minced 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 pound salmon Directions 1.In a small bowl, mix the maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic, garlic salt, and pepper. 2.Place salmon in a shallow glass baking dish, and coat with the maple syrup mixture. Cover the dish, and marinate salmon in the refrigerator 30 minutes, turning once. 3.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 4.Place the baking dish in the preheated oven, and bake salmon uncovered 20 minutes, or until easily flaked with a fork."

614089,HTHM,2011-08-21 21:10:00,4082,"That's it, I want a re-do!"
614090,misfish,2011-08-21 21:12:00,29133,"I have done many many ways, of cooking fish from Lake O. None,and I mean none,tasted worth consuming.  I can cook  them up from GBAY,no prob,taste awesome.  Explain this?"
614091,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-21 21:13:00,2690,Sounds good Albert!  Pretty similiar to the brine I use for smoking salmon.  Should turn out great.
614093,HTHM,2011-08-21 21:18:00,4082,GTA vs Greater Penetangeshine Area????
614096,misfish,2011-08-21 21:25:00,29133," Yes.Georgian Bay fish.  I can make a honey mustard/pepper paste for both and can tell the dif. This is why I have gone back to sea fish. Never fails.  Im not bashing those that eat from lake O,just saying my piece."
614098,Pikeslayer,2011-08-21 21:28:00,1443," Selective harvest works for me Brian. Salmon 12 lbs & under and are better smoked ( my personal preference ). Bows less than 10 lbs are great baked simple with lemon, dill and butter. All of our harvested fish are put on ice immediately and cleaned/gutted on board within 15/20 minutes and put back in the ice box. Dressed at home same day and anything not on the menu within 24 hours is flash frozen and vacuum sealed. Bigger/mature fish is equivalent to eating a 10 yr old chicken. Not nice.  Just my thoughts/preferences.  Cheers, Simon"
614100,misfish,2011-08-21 21:36:00,29133,"Maybe it,s that, Im  use to east coast taste Simon. A pouched cod with nothing but sea salt.  Enjoy Albert.To each thier own."
614103,Pikeslayer,2011-08-21 21:45:00,1443, I don't think any Ontario fish could hold up to your home waters. I'll have to ask my aunt to cook me up some of that pouched cod. Sound pretty yummy.
614106,misfish,2011-08-21 21:58:00,29133,"  Dont say I didnt warn ya.   Just so all dont get me wrong. If it,s for you,by all means ,enjoy."
614108,HTHM,2011-08-21 22:00:00,4082,"I have every intention of enjoying, soon as my wife gets home from church it's going in the the oven. I twisted my ankle today so I stayed home this afternoon."
614288,Guest Martine,2011-08-22 12:56:00,0,I love salmon cream soup with rice noodle:) So delicious and it's very easy to cook it at home.
