612068,rippinlipsfishingteam,2011-08-14 17:38:00,76,I need to 're-arm' my pfd. They take a 33 gram c02 cylinder.  Just curious on the best place to get these and ...can they be refilled or do I just have to buy new ones ?  Thanks !
612070,irishfield,2011-08-14 17:41:00,26272,Saw them in the locked case in CTC the other day... I think it was $30.  ...sorry.. $34.99 + tax !  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Marine/LifejacketsPFDs/PRD~0791826P/Mustang+Auto+Rearm+Kit.jsp?locale=en
612074,HTHM,2011-08-14 17:59:00,4082,A rearm kit for my mustang costs ~ $25 at a marine supply house in Hamilton. Brewers Marine I believe.
612139,Roy,2011-08-14 21:51:00,13728,The standard MSRP on those is $29.95. It's one of the few things I don't mind buying at full price for. That and parachutes.
612142,Jer,2011-08-14 22:17:00,1426,"  You buy alot of those, Roy?"
612188,rippinlipsfishingteam,2011-08-15 01:22:00,76,  Thanks guys... I blew one up by accident the other day cleaning the vest   .... stuuuuuupid hahaha
613966,Roy,2011-08-21 11:56:00,13728,"Well, it happened. Went to take the tarp off the boat last week and my vest had blown up. I'd left the darned thing on the floor of the boat by accident and spilled a lot of water on it while taking off the tarp. Well I'm not a bargain hunter when it comes to these things but I went to CTC and saw that there was one left (33 gram, 1/2 inch) marked ""liquidation, $12.99"" . Grabbed it, went to the cash where they rang it up at 17.99. I didn't complain..just came back home and re-packed the vest. That was still $10 less than regular price."
