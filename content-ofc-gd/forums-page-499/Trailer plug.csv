Since I am having a hard time trying to find this exact plug I am going to use a standard white,brown,yellow,green 4 pin, Am I correct in assuming that you take the yellow and green wires with the brown stripe and attach them to the single brown wire?"
614235,Lokka,2011-08-22 04:40:00,32,sounds right as the brown wires are usually tail lights. the white is the ground. Nissan wired up my moms 5 wire to 4 wire adapter and screwed it all up.. now i have to rip it apart and fix it.
614238,workwear,2011-08-22 09:12:00,592,i believe the fifth wire is your brake disconnect....on my trailer if ever i reverse it disengages my surge brakes....ya might wanna reconsider goin to a four plug
614303,Lokka,2011-08-22 13:21:00,32, You should have a 5 plug harness with a blue wire. the blue wire is for breaks and the 5th plug is reverse sensor.
614376,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-22 15:22:00,4399,"The plug is as shown no blue wire and there are no brakes on my trailer, like I mentioned I can`t find this plug anywhere it came of my trailer that was suppllied with the Stratos."
614386,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-22 15:37:00,10439,You are correct. Connect the yellow/brown and the green/brown together to the brown on the new plug.
614450,ld17,2011-08-22 18:19:00,319, I just did what driffter said last week with my plug and everything works like it should.
614465,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-22 18:39:00,4399,Thanks. I have had 3 of these things come apart this year after using them once or twice bunch of crap!!!
614495,vinnimon,2011-08-22 19:33:00,2593,"Pretty simple to figure out, as stated before, and as dave have said as well. White wire - ground Yellow/brown- left side running lights Green /brown- right side running lights Green- right turn and brake lights Yellow- left turn and brake lights  You can splice the wires to a four wire plug. Check with a test light and make sure the auto end was wired up correctly. Keep this in mind for future reference, yellow is always left side and green is always right side, hench the L and R in yellow and green. Come to think of it, I do have to rewire a 53 ft trailer in the am, lights, abs system and all I love these jobs"
