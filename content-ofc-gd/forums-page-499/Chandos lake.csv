613265,johnnyb,2011-08-18 15:27:00,3413,"Welcome aboard, Bentley!  How long have you been on Chandos?  I've never fished it, but heard good things about it....what are you trying to target?  Do you have access to a boat? Some of these details might help people give you more accurate info.  Nobody is likely to give specific spots, but could at least point you in the direction of what structure to look for. As for ice fishing, you should get a copy of the fishing regulations....easy to find on line or at your local bait/tackle shop, or even Canadian Tire.  REally...you shouldn't even be fishing without having consulted the regs for any special rules you need to be aware of.  Good luck....hopefully someone chimes in....and hopefully you can share some of your success with us"
613275,Bentley101,2011-08-18 16:03:00,4,"oh i dont ice fish anyways, i was just curious about what my neighbour said thats all, and i do have access to a boat and i've been on chandos for 21 years, i'm targeting mainly bass or pike really cause thats what locals tell me whats good in that lake"
613327,johnnyb,2011-08-18 18:36:00,3413,"Oh...another handy feature of the board is the Search function.  You can actually search for all threads related to Chandos....then go catch a pile of fish....post a report...look like an expert, and soon everyone will be asking YOU what to do"
613444,esoxansteel,2011-08-19 00:31:00,1307,"Chandos is closed for winter fishing, fished it once last year for a week in late July out of a cottage on Gilmour Bay, picked up one of the adventure maps, and scouted the first day marking structure and putting in waypoints, caught ample smallies up to 4lbs with average around a pound and a half, Big Pike had moved to deeper water by then but caught several small Pike off weedlines, spring is the time for big Pike on Chandos as they are up higher in the water column, and stickbaits on and adjacent to rock shoals produces, look at the deeper lake trout water you will see baitfish and hooks around them, dont be afraid to vertical jig with spoons and white tubes as well for the lake trout, natural colors worked the best browns greens motoroil etc for plastics, and the cotton cordel Big O in brown and crawfish color was the predominant crank again for smallies."
613613,Bentley101,2011-08-19 15:27:00,4,"thanks a bunch guys, very helpful"
613724,Garry2Rs,2011-08-19 22:41:00,1425,"I sometimes guide on Chandos for LMBass and SMBass plus Pike in the Spring. There are Lake Trout there too, if you want to troll for them. There is no winter fishing."
