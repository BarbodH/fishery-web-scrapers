613711,Nipfisher,2011-08-19 22:10:00,2449," Blue-green algae found on west arm <H3 class=npSubheadline></H3> By QMI Agency  Posted 36 minutes ago Water test results from the West Arm of Lake Nipissing, west of Highway 64, are positive for blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria.  The Ministry of the Environment advised the Sudbury and District Health Unit that the water samples show a species of cyanobacteria, which can produce toxins.  ""Water contaminated with blue-green algal blooms has an unsightly pea soup appearance and foul smell,"" Allan McDougall of the health unit, said in a release Friday.  ""Visible algal blooms can produce toxins; therefore, using or drinking the water should be avoided,"" he added.  The algae may be seen in other parts of the lake. It is not anchored, so wind and water action can move it around.  All residents on the lake should watch for blooms in their area, the health unit advised.  As always, residents are reminded that water contaminated with the bacterium has a pea soup appearance and foul smell. Visible algal blooms can produce toxins harmful to people and animals, so the water should be ingested or used for drinking or cooking.  For more on what to do if blue-green algal blooms are evident in your location, visit the health unit website at www.sdhu.com.  "
