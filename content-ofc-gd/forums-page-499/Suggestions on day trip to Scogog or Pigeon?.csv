Basically threw away all the known ""hot spots"" and reworked the drop offs with heavy weeds. On a funny note you could actually see decent sized bass in the deep swimming area waiting for you to disturb the bigger rocks so they could grab the crayfish. They would hover around your knees while you tipped rocks over and then quickly snatch the crayfish!  2) Just back from Gull Lake and the Hoola Popper was on fire close to the shore lines with still water (Early morning/ late evening) . My brother said I should mount the lure!   Anyways, looks like we won't be getting up to Nippising this year so still itching for some pike fishing in some cabbage. We are in the Hamilton area so thought a early morning run up to Scugog or Pigeon for the day would do the trick.  Can anyone point us to a boat launch that would quicken our day?  Heck, if there is a better (closer) suggestion for decent pike that would be great also!  Thank you ahead of time."
614009,Jer,2011-08-21 15:05:00,1426,"  Well, anywhere would be better for decent (or any) pike. Neither lake suggested has a pike population (except for the odd stray). Of course, musky is certainly an option..."
614031,Raycaster,2011-08-21 16:09:00,528, Not sure if anyone has ever said no to muskie!
