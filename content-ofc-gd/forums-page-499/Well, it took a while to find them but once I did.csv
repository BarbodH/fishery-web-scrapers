613958,Big Cliff,2011-08-21 09:48:00,6899,"Finally got a chance to get out for some walleye yesterday, I hit a couple of spots that I have fished sucessfully in the past but couldn't seem to get much in the way of action. Two hours of fishing and I had only managed to get one fish to the side of the boat only to watch it shake off.  I started changing up, trying a variety of combinations and presentations until all of a sudden I hit the right one and it was non stop from that point on.  In the next two hours I managed to land 10 walleye, lost a couple of more and as a bonus picked up a few nice SM to boot. Nothing huge, the biggest walleye just over the slot, the biggest SM about 2.5 lbs but it sure made for a nice morning of fishing.  Went back out after supper last night, landed one walleye right off the bat and then the thunder and lightning started so I booted it back home. Just got the boat put away and walked in the house and down it came so I guess it was a good call.  Anyway, going to head back out again this morning and see if I can do a repeat of yesterday as long as the thunder storms don't move back in. The cold front may slow things down a bit but I'm anxious to see if yesterdays combination will pay off again."

614033,Big Cliff,2011-08-21 16:15:00,6899,"Boy it sure was different out there this morning, the cold front moving in really slowed them down, only managed two walleye and a couple of decent size perch in about three hours of fishing. Decided it was a perfect day to make a big pot of homemade pork and beans, they are in the oven baking and should be ready for supper. Oh well, the cold front will move out in the next day or two and that should improve the fishing again."
