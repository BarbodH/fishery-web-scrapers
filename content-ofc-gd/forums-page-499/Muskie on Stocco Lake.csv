614042,monsterfish,2011-08-21 17:37:00,48,"Colour doesn't really matter as long as its black! hehe!  And keep your hooks sharp!  Cheers Monster  P.S. In direct opposition of what I just told you, I've heard it be said that fire tiger suicks are the way to go on Stocco!"
612800,Insighzor,2011-08-17 01:10:00,7,Hey there.  My name is John and i own a cottage on Stocco Lake. Iv'e been around for about 10 years now and iv'e yet to land a muskie. I need some spots to try more than anything and types of lures to use. Iv'e tried splashing with top lures the most in front of the weedy beds. I really want to land one of these monster fish and i know Stocco has em - iv'e seen people pull out 50 inch+ fish fairly often I just need to know how to tempt one!  Help me!  thanks
612802,irishfield,2011-08-17 01:14:00,26272,May wanna rethink the name then.. but WELCOME aboard !!  This time a year.. look for 15 to 20 feet and fish it.
612804,Pigeontroller,2011-08-17 01:21:00,2793,Can't go wrong fishing the 'weedy beds'
612822,Insighzor,2011-08-17 02:01:00,7,"Any lure suggestions? - for the 15-20 ft. depths? also - any suggestions for top lures that they may be more likely to smash? iv'e gotten a couple to come up and smash the bait, but thats about it. and the name is a work in progress lol"
612823,irishfield,2011-08-17 02:02:00,26272,"Legend perch bait... Double D.. something with a good lip and a good ""hip"" shake. That or a good size Believer."
612825,ccmtcanada,2011-08-17 02:05:00,7971,"I'm not an expert, but from what I've been told, topwater is more for early morning and late light fishing.  Concentrate on shallower water...weedbeds etc for that.  Once the sun is up this time of year I have trouble finding them in shallower water and they must go deeper.  For me, medium sized to large orange/black combination spinnerbaits and bucktails seem to work well.  Good luck!"
612831,bucktail,2011-08-17 02:12:00,1857,Try the weedbeds adjacent to the river mouth and up the lake by the islands.
612843,Insighzor,2011-08-17 02:32:00,7,i'll try a couple of those divers suggested. any suggestions for top bait?  im going up this weekend i need to land one!! secrets! come on! lol
612851,mike rousseau,2011-08-17 02:48:00,4661,Topwater...  Top raider Jackpot Rumbler Doc   Cranks... Most cranks will work in that depth this time of year... You dont  need to get it right in front of them... Right now I'm catching musky running 5-10 feet off the bottom while trolling... So any cranks that dive 5-20 feet should work...
612853,Insighzor,2011-08-17 02:52:00,7,tried top raider - two colours. got two smashes on it before but nothing takes it. im going to try perch coloured lures i guess. if theres any other colours people have had luck with on stocco specifically let me know! Iv'e heard purple from a neighbour but.. you never know.  thanks for all the suggestions guys
612856,irishfield,2011-08-17 02:56:00,26272,What colour is the water?
612859,Insighzor,2011-08-17 03:07:00,7,uh. blue? lol  its fairly murky i think. - darker blue if anyone else who fishes this lake could describe it better by all means.
612861,irishfield,2011-08-17 03:15:00,26272,"Dark.. dark bait.. light/clear.. light bait. Rig a rod with a black/orange bait and another with a bright perch coloured bait. Main thing is to match the siloet of what they are eating in the lake. Perch, Bass, Whitefish??"
612872,Insighzor,2011-08-17 03:50:00,7,"perch, sunfish and bass i'd say."
612874,irishfield,2011-08-17 03:52:00,26272,So there's a big start.. one rod with a  perch coloured bait and one nice and dark to make them think it's a smallie they're chompin at.
612875,cram,2011-08-17 04:22:00,1733,Put away the topwater and cast a bucktail or spinnerbait along the side of those weeds.
612876,camillj,2011-08-17 04:51:00,1988,"May also trying a cast and fast retrieve (just before hitting bottom) with a big flashy spoon and a little 'teaser' mister-twister tail (I like silver spoon with yellow tail on a sunny day) ... 4"" Johnson silver minnow with a double twister tail and a trailer-hook works like a charm for those near misses...SHARPEN YOUR HOOKS REGULARLY !"
612972,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-08-17 16:24:00,535,"I was in Stoco for a couple hours on Sat, the water is very murky there right now. I ran into Stacy Ash from protackle when I was leaving (he was actually waiting for Theo Fleury to meet him there to take him on a musky charter), he said bright colours (orange/green) would work well. Something highly visable in the stained water. He also said it's a good time of year for bucktails. I like using them because you can burn them over top of the weeds without getting hung up all the time. Of course, I have yet to catch a musky so I'm not the best person to give advice, but at least the pike seem to like them.   What Irishfield said about dark water=dark colours and vice versa makes perfect sense. Think about the colour of the fish you catch in different waters. When I catch fish in murkier waters, they're always darker. In bright crystal clear water they're very light. It's always good trying to duplicate what they're naturally feeding on in that particular body of water while fishing for any predatory fish."
612974,Harrison,2011-08-17 16:31:00,2202,"I enjoy Stucco lake alot.  I am more of a bass/walleye guy, but when fishing the deep weed edges we tied into a couple musky but they sliced the 65lb braid like butter, never got alook at them.  We were using dark baits, Black and Blues.  This was Aug 11."
612977,Ben_Daniels,2011-08-17 17:03:00,435,"Wow You guys are changing! I never thought a new person to the board would be able to ask questions about a Specific lake without getting their head ripped off! lol Trust me Musky King you REALLY lucked out, especially without an Into! Welcome aboard!"
612978,blaque,2011-08-17 17:05:00,2419," Hes just being proactive I'd guess. LOL He's gonna get there eventually, and didnt want to start his post count all over again by having to change his username when he gets there."
612990,irishfield,2011-08-17 17:38:00,26272," Well Ben I've never been one to buy into this ""show me your credentials before joining the club"" type of guy, as that starts to stink after a while, so maybe me making the first reply saved him. Add to that that I've also never fished Stocco! A lake is a lake, you need to learn to read it and the fish/food within it to gain some success.  Now as to those that spoke of specifics to the lake...."
612995,grimsbylander,2011-08-17 17:53:00,3016,"  How about ""Muskie Kidding"" LOL  Forget it, save it for me. If you catch one musky you'll have one more than me!"
613206,Musky or Specks,2011-08-18 11:09:00,2710,I've only fished Stocco once for a four day weekend. Managed 6 fish but no giants although I did get a fitty to follow. My fish all came casting parallel to lily pad fields in 10 to 15 feet of water using either a smallmouth coloured ZoomR (Not Made any more but one of my favourite jerk baits) or a black sucker/yellow tail Squirrelly Burt. Two of my fish did come off the outside of the island out from the boat launch.
613211,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-18 11:38:00,4399,  Blue eh! Well there is your problem your fishing in your toilet bowl!!!  Sorry can`t help you with the Musky can`t stand the slimmy buggers!!!
