My 2 biggest requests are, onion/pepper/cheese ( cream cheese, cheddars..whatever you like ),,pizza roll-cheese & pepperoni inside.  I had a request last week to do some for a reunion, so ,I took some pics..  I've tried many different things to roll the sausage out on,and can tell ya..PARCHMENT paper sprayed with Pam, is the easiest to use...bar none!   ingredients & setup...   roll CHILLED sausage out on parchment paper,,   put ur favorite 'stuff' on the sausage...sauce, cheese & pepperoni in this case..   lift one end of the paper to start the rolling up...   just keep rolling slowly, squeeze the roll as needed..till it looks like a meatloaf..   smoke ur favorite way..    yum!!!!!   another treat is to use groung beef, layered with American cheese, roll up & smoke...sliced cheeseburgers!!  go have fun"
