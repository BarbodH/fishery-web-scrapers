613915,Joey,2011-08-21 00:26:00,9122,"We had a lovely day out on the big lake with Brian (Misfish) and his wife Betty.  We got down to meet them at the launch at about 7:15 and things went much faster with Brian helping to get the boat set up and in the water.  We headed out to a mass of boats and steered to the right of them to stay out of the fray while Paul and Brian set up the lines and downriggers.  Things were very slow today out there and we went 2 for 4.  Betty was first up and caught a nice little bow    Check out those nails - funky!!!!!!    Next up was Brian but he said you take it Joey, ladies first, so as he passed me the rod we thought we had a double header as the other rod was going off, but it ended up being a line tangle with the two rods, and mine had the fish on.  We reeled in as best we could and this fish was pretty big.  Paul was just about to cut the line off the other rod and my line snapped right off      Heartbreaking!!!   Next fish up was Brian's turn and he did a great job reeling in, especially with all the fleas on the line (we did have flea flicker line on, but it got all twisted up).  Between him reeling and Paul picking off the fleas and netting the fish, they got it in     A beauty Salmon!     We had one more on later in the day, but it was a shaker and got off pretty quick.  Here are some ramdom shots of our day.   Brian looking pretty darn comfy in that Pro V captain seat again     Brian rarely took his eyes off those rods    Sorry Brian, couldn't resist              We got a bit of a chuckle over this set up     Hey, whatever works right!!!!                 I also tried the underwater camera in the livewell to see how it worked       All in all, even tho the fish were not as coopertive as we would have liked, we still had an awesome day with two very special friends.  You two are welcome to fish with us anytime.  And thanks for lunch Brian, you make good sandwiches  Cheers,  Joey"

613940,Joey,2011-08-21 01:44:00,9122,"  I know Terry, I got a good laugh from it.  But the offer still stands sandwiches or not"
613959,Big Cliff,2011-08-21 09:57:00,6899,"Looks like the perfect combination, good people, good food, and some fish as a bonus. Doesn't get much better than that. Looks like that underwater camera does a good job too!"

614024,misfish,2011-08-21 15:48:00,29133,"Now that I got some rest(rushed my report) Here was my plan.  I wanted to plan a day for Betty.As some know,she has been out of work since April 1st and not having much luck out there in the work world.Being home I could see she was getting humdrum.  So I decided to put out a fealer for a day on lake O (something she has never done)and hope she would get a fish. Mission complete thanks again to Joey and Paul. Since we were going to be down there and had to drive back to Barrie,I made reservations at a resurant that I use to be a busboy at ,I was 15 yoa. We also ate there the two years we dated 16-18. It was a regular friday night place for us for 5-7 years,then we moved to Barrie and havent been there since. She loved that place for thier homemade italian food. After we left Joey and Paul I drove up to Brampton and when I made the turn,she was very surprised.We were greeted by the owner who was very surprised and happy to see us. Dinner was as good as it was back then.Everything still homemade from scratch.  Mission completed.   Well thats it.  Thanks again guys.   Brian   Great underwater shots J."
