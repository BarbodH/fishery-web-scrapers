613788,danc,2011-08-20 02:18:00,4677,"I don't fish as much as I used to, or would like to, simply because I cant find the time. I don't know how some you guys do it on here, putting up post after post of fishing reports. I'm mortgage free, get paid a very good wage, and I can barely find the time or the money to go fishing for a weekend. What am I doing wrong??"

613814,Fish Farmer,2011-08-20 11:27:00,2234,"Gas prices keep going up, you'll see a lot less. Pretty hard to pull a boat with a Civic."
613891,Rich,2011-08-20 20:42:00,3927,"In this world of quick rewards and utter lack of outdoor education, everybody just wants to catch exactly what they want, everytime they go, instantly. I honestly give up trying to take anyone fishing or get them interested, everybody, EVERYBODY is impatient and stupid. People still really believe there's luck involved."
613892,Rich,2011-08-20 21:01:00,3927," Indeed. Change your priorities if time is an issue. Or, if you 'cant' change priorities, I guess fishing is not that important to you.    Smaller boats, shore fishing, or heaven forbid walking to the fishing spot. There's more places to fish than on a boat up north. But you might have to settle for a ""lesser desirable"" species.  But wait, how many people fish solely for food? I guess you don't love fishing if that's the case, you love cheap food."
613898,fishinguypat,2011-08-20 22:17:00,547,I don't see what the problem is fishing is way to over crowded in ontario anyways
613899,mercman,2011-08-20 22:29:00,7054,"  Priorities Dan. Its all in how you prioritize your activities. Helps also, if you don`t have anything else to do"
613282,craigdritchie,2011-08-18 16:23:00,1586,"A new study, jointly released today by the Recreational Boating and Fishing Foundation (RBFF) and The Outdoor Foundation, says the number of anglers in the United States is still declining, even though more people are getting into fishing each year.  The number of anglers in the US is now pegged at 45.3 million, down from 47.9 million in 2010.  There are no figures for Canada, since it's an American study, but the 10 percent rule likely applies here as well. License sales in our country have also been declining steadily for years.  Click here to read more, and download a full copy of this 75-page bad boy. It's very interesting reading. For instance, did you know that in the US over 30 percent of all anglers are now female?"
613288,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-18 16:33:00,2690,"  Happy to say, that we're working on turning three young lads into fishermen. It's up to us anglers to pass the torch, to our children, nephews, nieces, grandchildren etc."
613305,Oryx,2011-08-18 17:28:00,186,I wonder if there is a corelation to the the # of fishing licences sold to the # of XBOX's sold????
613307,mistaredone,2011-08-18 17:33:00,913,Good.  Less people on the water lol!
613310,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-18 17:57:00,130," good speculation.  that Avatar pic...that is a photoshop job, right?"
613312,Oryx,2011-08-18 18:07:00,186,"  No photoshop, funny as hell though.  Here is the link.  Notice on the big pic the tow line attached to the boat trailer to pull it back up http://www.sschapterpsa.com/ramblings/boat_launch_observations.htm  I also saw Fishing games at BP.  LOL, all the fun of fishing without the bait.   I can see it now...""DAHD, you erased my game, how am i sposed to show my friends I really caught a 15lb bass"""
613331,adolson,2011-08-18 18:45:00,783, I was thinking the same thing...
613332,Harrison,2011-08-18 18:46:00,2202,"I am hoping there may be a surge when the baby boomers head north and have time for new hobbies.  Not science, jsut a thought."
613350,highdrifter,2011-08-18 20:15:00,2534,No complaints here...  It'll be up to us to pass down the torch when the time comes..
613354,Grimace,2011-08-18 20:33:00,2020,Less anglers means less people who care about anglers rights which leads to less anglers rights.
613359,timmeh,2011-08-18 20:52:00,609," yup, that's a much less thought of angle but one that's very important. Our voices are being drowned out by city folk who've never seen a fish outside of the grocery store."
613364,bigugli,2011-08-18 21:05:00,6138,"Unless the outdoor community maintains a large and very visible presence, we will continue to be ignored while our interests are sacrificed and sold out."
613369,craigdritchie,2011-08-18 21:22:00,1586,"Absolutely bang-on. If you think fishing has zero clout in Ottawa and Queens Park now, give it another 10 years when there are even fewer of us out there. Fish and wildlife management budgets will be even easier to cut if they impact fewer people.  Operating jar hatcheries and cleaning up creeks is important, but unless we all get out there are start introducing new people to fishing, none of it will really matter."
613375,OhioFisherman,2011-08-18 21:52:00,6623," Unfortunately a study here says almost 50% of them didn`t plan properly for retirement, they will be lucky to afford food, shelter, and health care.  A lot more choices out there for the recreational dollar now than 50 years ago. At 3-4 bucks a gallon for fuel? the price of fish went up? and a world of instant gratification, most won`t put in the time to really learn how to fish."
613447,Rizzo,2011-08-19 00:42:00,4754,"still the same number fishing, they just aren't buying licenses! Depending on the lakes you fish, you could go a lifetime without being checked and maybe some people are beginning to figure that out"
613498,craigdritchie,2011-08-19 02:25:00,1586,"Rizzo - the study I mention is based on surveying real people. It is not tied to license sales at all. Yet, it shows a steady decline, just as multiple other studies also show."
613503,hammercarp,2011-08-19 02:46:00,964,People are working more hrs now than they did 20 years ago. Less leisure time.
613524,blue pickeral,2011-08-19 09:53:00,267," In some ways not surprising....in my younger days, male friends and I would read 'Cosmopolitan' magazine articles telling the women where to go to meet guys...then we would go there.  Joking aside...my spouse has a lot more fun than I do as she is fairly successful trying techniques that pop into her head at any time, as opposed to the 'usual' methods for various species."
613535,Oryx,2011-08-19 12:16:00,186,"Part of the problem with the decline , IMO, are the cities.  Most people flock to live there, and the new generation of kids (laughing as I am 35) have no idea of hard work and are afraid to get their hands dirty.  They expect to have everything handed to them without question.  As fun as fishing is, do you honestly think that the majority of this generation will put down the iphone for 10 mins to enjoy the outdoors?  I can see the facebook post now. (said in the best Mike Stafford, AM640 voice) ""Stuck outdoors with my Dahd, I'm starving, the bugs just plain suck, and I bought a new Playstation game....I wanna go home""  Glad I grew up on a lake to fully appreciate the outdoors and what it has to offer."
613546,mercman,2011-08-19 12:52:00,7054,"  Glad to know i'm not the only one . I find myself watching her and doing what she does in the hopes of discovering new technics As long as she is happy, we get to fish more than the average married dude BP.  Alot has to do with us, as anglers too.We should be more willing to take new potential anglers with us on our boats. Alot of us use fishing as an escape to solitude. I recently took my 29 year old daughter out for her first fishing experience.After a 10 min course on using a spinning combo, she was catching fish. Now she wants to go again Share your passion with everyone.Offer a seat in your boat or a ride to your favorite shoreline, to any friend you have who doesnt fish.You may get a new fishing buddy out of the deal."
613557,Beans,2011-08-19 13:10:00,3339, I don't think license sales are a good example as the baby-boomers born 1945-1946 are becoming senior citizens and don't need one anymore with more to come in the following years...   
613571,Grimace,2011-08-19 13:37:00,2020,"Instead of fishing people are becoming drug addicts and gamblers, IT'S CHEAPER!!!!!   Depending on who you talk to, more respectable as well.  Lol.  :-p"
613695,splashhopper,2011-08-19 21:17:00,2931,"glad to hear,..... more fishies for me"
613752,MJL,2011-08-20 00:03:00,2427," I'm hoping there will be a surge of interest from single, highly attractive female anglers who dig steelhead and don't complain about the cold, rain or bugs...That may be wishful thinking though"
613753,fishinmortician,2011-08-20 00:22:00,100,more fish for me!!
