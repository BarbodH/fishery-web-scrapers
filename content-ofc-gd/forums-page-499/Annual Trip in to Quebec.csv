Last year we had a great time but the fishing was wasn't the best. I was really hoping this year with a new lake and a new cabin would produce some more fish for us.... and thankfully it did.  We left Ottawa around 6 am on Aug 5th. There were 6 of us and we couldn't wait to get on the road for the beautiful drive up to our location. The packing job was one of my better ones.    We stopped quickly in cassleman for a bite to eat and then it was a non stop drive to our destination of Saint-michel-des-saints in Quebec. The drive up was beautiful... its just a different landscape then Ontario with a lot for mountains (obviously) and is just a neat drive    We arrived at the checkin and paid our dues for the next 3 days, were given a map with the roads highlighted all the way to our camp. The trek was about 45min away from the small town on dirt roads. The perfect way to drive in. I had done a lot of research and picked a place that had its own lake. With no cabin or people around for at least 30km it was the perfect spot.  The ride in was awesome      Finally we arrived at our cabin. It was a smaller place then last year and actually a little more updated then i had expected. Propane fridge and stove with solar powered lights, hot water and a shower. Also there was a bed for all of us.. no spooning means no complaints.        Supplied with the cost of the place were 2 16' fiberglass boats but you had to supply your own motors or rent them if need be. We had 2 9.9 which was perfect for the size of the small lake we were on. The lake only had 2 species of fish in it... perch and pike. We were all pretty excited to see if one of us could land a big gator.  We rigged up quickly and preped the boats and were out on the water. I had brought an old bottom line fishing buddy fish finder for depth mainly so we could troll at a decent depth. We trolled over to a small bay and stopped the motor to cast. Within 5 mins the first fish was caught.. by yours truly. Not big by any means but it was good to know fish were here    next was Joe    We caught about half a dozen fish that size in that small bay and then the biggest fish of the trip was caught.... No attawapiskat monster but for a non pike fisherman like myself... it was a big fish.    she weighed 7.5lbs and i was pretty excited.  We caught a few more small pike and the ones that were hooked badly we kept for the surf and turf later.          At one point one of my rod and reel combos fell out of the boat.... for some reason i decided to grab the other two i was fishing with and try and snag the sinking rod. As i am doing this my  buddy Adam had already fell into the water to save the rod. He comes up with the combo in hand and tells me ""i think i have a trebele in me"" at this point i drop the other 2 rods in the water in fear of burying the hooks in deeper. Needless to say those rods i dropped were not the ones hooked in Adam and lost the 2 of them. So he saved 1 but i lost 2.... ahh how can you be mad at someone after that effort    That put the cap on fishing for that day so we headed back in for a few beverages and to relax on our beach.       Dinner that night was steak potatoes corn and some fresh pike.... we ate like kings.     Day 2   Since i was the first to bed i had to be the first one up so i didnt look like to much of an old man. I was up at about 7am and out on the water by myself at 715. All the other lads were still asleep. I caught 1 small one and had another good one on but lost him          We decided that day that we were going to take a trip down the small river off of our lake to a small unnamed body of water that was big enough to be considered a small lake. We packed out bags and headed out.. the weather was beautiful and very hot. It was quite the journey to arrive at our destination. Driving most of the time with the motors trimmed up and even having to get out and pull the boat it was quite the adventure into unknown waters.    Along the way there was a deep pool in a narrow section of the river.... Joe casted out and had his first decent pike hit right at the boat.    after a few casts on we went...           After about an hour of hard treking through dense weeds and bog we finally made it to the little lake... and boy was it worth it.... the first one is Joe with his pb pike and biggest fish he has ever caught... good on a Joe!                     The other boys did well also.... in total we put probably 25 pike in 4 hours in the boat between the six of us.   The trek into that tiny lake was so tough that i bet there wasnt to many people that had been in the to fish in quite some time. I think thats why we did so well even in the middle of the day. It was a great afternoon on the water but it was time to get back for something to eat and get geared up for the evening fish.      When we got back to the cabin my buddy Fitz had a nice little surprise. He had a crate of golf balls to eat out into the lake... the only problem was he was left handed.... we made due anyways as you will see.      We had some lunch and headed back out on the water around 630 or so for the evening bite. We were all pumped up after a good day on the water already.      A few minutes after starting to troll I see the other boat heading back into shore... i turn off the motor and yell to them ""whats up?"" My buddy Fitz yells back ""Jer has a hook in his hand"" I ask ""bad?"" to which he replies ""hospital bad"". We reel in our lines and head to shore... we are greeted on the beach by this...      The hook was in deep. Jer had caught a small pike that had stuck him while flipping around in the boat. There was no way to turn this hook out the side because it was embedded straight in. We had all been drinking and a 45min bush road trip out to a french speaking small town was the option at first... not the best one but it did not look like this hook was going to t. We had a small first aid kit with some peroxide and other bandages but nothing to help the situation to much. Then my buddy Adam took charge and decided ""this hook is coming out now"". Jer was reluctant at first but said he would give adam one shot to pull it out the way it went in. Jer took a shot of rye and held on to Joe tight as Adam gave the hook a solid pull and.......    (notice the bend on that treble)  we covered the wound with peroxide and celebrated another good day out on the water with good friends and company. I wild end to a wild day          Day 3   The next day i was up again at about 730 and out on the water. The weather did not look as promising as the first two days but after yesterday it really didnt matter how the rest of the trip went weather wise.    A little reminder from the night before        Only 1 hit that morning and nothing to show for an hour out on the water.  Day 3 was something a little different we had booked out spot on another lake within 25min of driving that was stocked with speckled trout. So we loaded up our gear... motors and all and loaded them into the trucks for another adventure. The weather was rolling in fast but we hoped for blue skies by the time we got there.    Before we left i noticed the girlfriend had slipped something into my bag.... i guess she thought i would forget about her       continued..................................."
613907,BassMan11,2011-08-20 23:10:00,583,The road in was another awesome drive.... just made the trip that much better.         Finally made it to our lake. We were excited to get out on the water because of the success we had last year fishing these trout.    Two 16' boats waiting for us    15 mins in we were hooked up with our first small spec    But then that was it.............. fished for 3 hours with not even another bite..... very weird considering last year with the same kind of conditions we caught 50 in an hour. So we made the decision to pack up and head back to the cabin and get in the evening fish. It was still a great adventure out with the boys....    As we got back to the cabin the weather started to break and it look like it was going to bed a decent evening for our last night on the lake.    We got out for a few hours but not to many fish were caught... just a couple small ones. I did get one on the jitterbug which is always a lot of fun.            That evening we had run out of wood..... we had seen a few piles close to the road into the cabin.... so we decided to go and get some that would last us for the evening.          Day 4 - The end  We were to be out of the cabin 12 so everyone was us early and cleaning the place out to get ready for the ride home. It was a sad day having to leave our own little piece of paradise but all good things must come to an end. I even brought a trophy to make the first official presentation for biggest fish...... but in the end i took my own award home    It feels good to organize a trip with a group of good friends and have everything work out. Not all of these boys fish but they all had a great time... a few of them catching their pb fish makes me feel like i did my job.  Thanks for reading  BassMan (aka pike man)   side note... sorry for the large picture... cant figure it out... also for the abundance of spelling mistakes.

613916,solopaddler,2011-08-21 00:31:00,8605,What a great trip! Looks like you boys had a fantastic time.
613920,Whitespinnerbait,2011-08-21 00:47:00,2038,Gald to see you did what a real Redneck would do..... Rip the hook out of Buddy's Finger
613936,Joey,2011-08-21 01:36:00,9122,"That looks and sounded like an excellent trip for all of you.  What a blast!!!  Glad your friend ended up getting the hook out without the dreaded trip to the hospital.  Good call  The pics are the perfect size, no apologies needed!!!  Excellent report."
613942,woodenboater,2011-08-21 01:48:00,2277,"Wow, awesome trip and definitely respectable sized pike. I'd be getting giddy driving those roads up to the cabin in anticipation of the fishing and good times with buds. Imma gonna have to hit google to figure out which outfitter you used  and that load of wood in your pickup would be very nice burning in the stove of my wall tent in about 3 or 4 months"
614023,BassMan11,2011-08-21 15:46:00,583,Ya the dry birch burned very nice. Burnt all that wood that night.
