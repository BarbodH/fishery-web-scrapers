399576,Moosebunk,2009-11-05 04:27:00,3970,You're kinda weird... but in a weirdly fun way.
399610,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-05 12:03:00,2038,  Just thought i would throw that old '' Cliche '' out like that
399635,blaque,2009-11-05 14:43:00,2419,That is truly awesome.
399636,blaque,2009-11-05 14:47:00,2419,"and BillyBob.........leafblowers are the worlds greatest invention for cleaning off the concrete after cutting the lawn, and even some leaves off of concrete/decks. But for cleaning up the main autumn leaf drop, off of the lawn. They are just plain useless. Ive also seen the rake beat the blower in that situation by embarrasing proportions."
399637,Harrison,2009-11-05 14:49:00,2202,Now that's funny!
399645,Billy Bob,2009-11-05 15:05:00,5865, I have a crazy neighbor that will wash down her driveway with her garden hose and then dry it with her leave blower......errrrrrrrrrr the horror.
399647,Bitsmith2k,2009-11-05 15:10:00,396," i know your pain.. we've got a neighbour that washes his cars and dries them with the leaf blower, most of the time at 7:30am.. he's getting a shamwow for xmas from us..  mike"
399649,Roy,2009-11-05 15:14:00,13728, Nothing that a handful of stone dust won't cure.
399650,Bitsmith2k,2009-11-05 15:19:00,396," lol.. we've had a bunch of ideas, though most of them revolved around human waste though.."
399655,Billy Bob,2009-11-05 15:32:00,5865,We were thinking of giving my neighbor a rake for the leaves but we were afraid she would fall off the ladder trying to rake them from the tree......
399677,blaque,2009-11-05 16:29:00,2419," Only in Lancaster Billy Bob. Doesnt she know it will eventually rain, and after that the water will evaporate.......sun and wind will speed that process up a bit."
399698,fisherman7,2009-11-05 17:53:00,325,That's funny!
399710,bubbles,2009-11-05 18:49:00,591,That is awesome!
399791,douG,2009-11-05 23:01:00,2693,"I have a neighbour that loves to use his leafblower to clean his deck.  Every morning.  He is not on my Christmas card list.  He's the sort that says that if you want peace and quiet, go live in the country.  I think that if you want to make all the noise you want with complete disregard for your neighbours, YOU go live in the country.  But that's just me."
399793,irishfield,2009-11-05 23:03:00,26272, I did douG !

399501,irishfield,2009-11-04 23:19:00,26272, Don't do the lawn thatch any good either Billy Bob... but as for blowing onto Neighbours yard from there... I think I'd need a tad more horsepower considering they're 2200 feet away !
399502,irishfield,2009-11-04 23:20:00,26272, Well the one taking the pictures knows which side to be on and the difference between suck and blow WSB... so no issues!
