400110,danjang,2009-11-07 00:13:00,148,"I had the day off today so I decided to go fishing. It just had to be done. So off I went to check out some eastern tribs. I was  at the first trib for 2 hours and nothing. Nothing at all, no one was catching anything. Off to the next trib I go and same story. No fish all day. I had enough in me for one more trib before I pack it up. The water was very low and clear but I decided to try anyways. The first drift resulted in my very first rainbow trout ever. I'm a newish fisherdude.     A short walk towards the lake and I spotted a dark shadowy figure under a log. Took me a while to cast well enough (it was very bushy) to get this brown to snatch my roe. My very first brown trout ever.    Not only did I catch 2 new fishes, I got myself my first float rod. Raven IM8 14' on sale for pretty cheap. I'm pretty stoked for tomorrow when I head out again to out do myself."
400113,yakpiker,2009-11-07 00:27:00,160,Congrat's on your two catches...especially the nice looking brown...your effort was rewarded.
400114,Paulus,2009-11-07 00:29:00,522,"  Well done! It's not easy to find browns out east anymore, so it's usually a pretty tricky business to get one. It takes most new anglers years to tie in to one that nice. Good for you & good luck tomorrow  p.-"
400116,lucabrasi,2009-11-07 00:38:00,114,"Well done! I hit the east as well, but didn't do as well as you. I hit three tribs and fished every log I could find with nothing to show for. Oh well, back at it again tommorow. Thanks for posting. Good luck."
400118,StoneFly,2009-11-07 00:48:00,574,"Nice Brown,...so your First real river Fish is a Brown before you catch a steelhead?  (the smolt doesn't count, I caught about 100 of those today...)   Now that is the defintition of Beiginner's luck."
400128,timmeh,2009-11-07 02:02:00,609,"Dang, your going to make a lot of people jealous posting a beauty brown like that, myself included.  Hopefully he produces a few more just like him so I can find one someday..."
400153,Cudz,2009-11-07 04:03:00,2652,nice brown.  be careful of the white stuff coming out it.  Don't know what it is so be careful with it.
