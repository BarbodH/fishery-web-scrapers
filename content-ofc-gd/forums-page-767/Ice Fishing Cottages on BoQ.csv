Or maybe we will just get a hotel and use a guide if we can't find a good cottage thing.  I saw one that said 80 per day for Cottage, Heated hut and minnows, has anyone used Sunset Cabins?  Normally i would just go myself and wander around and be happy with a skunker here and there, but since I will be taking the GF for her first quinte experience I want to try and make sure we get on some fish."
