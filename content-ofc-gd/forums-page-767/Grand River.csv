399117,basskicker09,2009-11-03 21:33:00,144,dont know of anyone that fishes there personally but i go up there once a week to get my smokes and always see people fishing below the damn and out in the middle of the river mostly casting flies do not if this helps at all
399118,Jeff Wiles,2009-11-03 21:41:00,55,It has been a vary slow year so far. I have been there 5or 6 times with vary little fish to show.  Jeff
399124,vinnimon,2009-11-03 22:31:00,2593,"fishing for bows has been steady but slow.fresh row is a must,and knowing the main arteries and feeding times will help you alot.there are a few holes down stream that produce fish,sorry I cant tell you where,its a secret.these same holes also holds picks at the same time.a little hard to get when the water rises.I hope this helps.pink p/bait worms are very effective here."

I fished first light and did not have a hit all morning, didn't see anyone else hook into anything either.  Fish were surfacing but not as many as you would expect for right now.  Very tough fishing with high water at least float fishing was.  Smed"
