They kicked Azz in that one period, or at least so says the scoreboard.  That's what I mean about Leaf hockey being fun.

400309,Fang,2009-11-08 02:54:00,1330,"pending on other outcomes the leafs have gone from 2nd worst to 5th worst. Looks like they will jump 3 teams with another win. Fire up the ticker tape boys I feel a turnanround on the season coming!!!  What a nice night to sit out around the fire pit, drink a few beers and listen to the game.

She loved him, yeah... she don't want to leave this way She feeds him, yeah... that's why she'll be back again (Better Man, Pearl Jam)  We've been fed crap for so long that we are becoming more than acustomed to the taste, we are telling ourselves that we like it.

400323,JohnF,2009-11-08 03:37:00,3494," I guess for the moment the Leafs are the better man, huh? Don't feel bad. There's lots of other folks who fell into the trap of thinking that winning is all that counts. We just have to believe what we keep telling our kids about sports - What's important is just having fun.  JF"
