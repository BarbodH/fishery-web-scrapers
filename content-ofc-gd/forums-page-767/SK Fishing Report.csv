Before anyone blames global warming, this kind of makes up for our coolest summer in decades.  All my fishing gear is put away and chance are, there is ice on the lakes, so I decided once and for all, Id fix those trailer bearings.  Seems I'm changing bearings at least once a season and I got sick and tired of driving anywhere on pins and needles so I decided to take the axle off.  One spindle was worned that my left end cap was too small for the right spindle.  Anyways I brought the axle to Browns Axles and basically he told me the original wasn't strong enough so he would make me a new one.  Yup a bigger Axel and two new spindles for $200, probably less that what Ive payed in the last couple of years doing the bearings myself, and once with a mechanic.  The problem is, will it fit.    Here is the original clamps that will now not fit the new axle as it is too small    So off to the Garage and make something up.  Here is what I came up with, Bolts and plates    I was lucky as everything seems to fit pretty good.  Things lined up to the original square plates.  You will notice that I have one homemade plate on the bottom of the Axle.      I'm going to keep an eye on it as I'm wondering if I should of doubled the home made plates as you can see it is bent around the axle.  Also I had to drill two holes in order to fit the axle over the centre plate nut.  Because the axle is hollow, I has put silicone around it.  On a different story there was an accident this week on the very road that I traveled last Sunday from Big River.  It was absolutely treacherous as I white knuckled my self an extra 1.5 hours than normal. I near lost the truck a couple of times due to ice.  Here is the story, as I was curious on where this accident occured.  http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoeni...fe-d974a48bc352  So on the way back I decided to find where this slew was.    Entering the reservation   Last weekend I slid through this T junction missing a truck, that's when I found out it was icy, up to that point I had no Idea.    Typical reservation Homestead    Yup, right grid all right   I figured it will be along this stretch    Yup this has to be it     They even left a fire Blanket here.  We used these woolen blankets with our stretchers in the Military    Id say with the debris, the track marks, broken ice, this was the horrible spot    Pretty sad, I imagine there will be a marker here that I will pass by on the weeknds now."
