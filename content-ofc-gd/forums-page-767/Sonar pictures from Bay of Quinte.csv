400506,Mako,2009-11-09 01:48:00,25,"Went out today for a couple of hours to test out my new trolling setups, we didn't land anything but was a great day to get out of the office.  The RSC linecounter reels are easy to use and feel really sturdy in your hand.  In my 20 years of fishing this was the first time I actually trolled for more than 20 mins. I'm a die hard caster but thought I should add something else to my arsenal. So I picked up these setups and now I'm a trolling newbie   I hope once I get my first fish it will become more exciting because just sitting there staring at the finder isn't that fun.....plus I end up eating more food just waiting for something to bite  I also went into Victoria harbour and the shad were pretty thick in spots.     This is what we were seeing a lot of, plus sometimes the hooks were 3 times this size.    Notice the bait ball on the bottom    This looks like crappie to me. Suspending and in a towering pattern.    RSC Linecounter reel and Magnum trolling rod.  "
