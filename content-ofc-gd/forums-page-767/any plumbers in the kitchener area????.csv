I just had a water softner installed today and the plumber that came didn't have the time or equipment to install a hard water/drinking water tap in my kitchen. Nor did he want to do anything without his bosses permission.....anyway, if there is a plumber in the kitchener-waterloo area that wants to make some quick cash and can do it sooner rather than later shoot me a pm and we can talk price.  Thanks  Dave"
