399538,dada2727,2009-11-05 01:15:00,108,"Anyone have any recent water temps, looking to go musky fishing and just trying to get a heads up.  Thxs"
399604,singingdog,2009-11-05 11:20:00,1047,The lakes I have been on in Haliburton are about 47 F. Looks like a great weekend.
399656,Abberz,2009-11-05 15:34:00,140,"Spent last weekend on Pigeon/Buckhorn - temps varied between 41-45 degrees. Slow weekend, we boated 3 fish, 41 inches being the biggest."
399880,dada2727,2009-11-06 02:35:00,108,"strange, thought haliburton would be cooler temps."
399891,EC1,2009-11-06 03:00:00,930,"Haliburton waters are a bit deeper, and take a longer time to cool. That would be my guess. One day a few weeks back I visited a lake way further north and the bass were still jumping, but when I got back to the kawarthas, the water was way cold and never saw a fish at the surface.  Sorry, can't help you with temps though..I don't have a fishfinder. I can tell you that the water in the Kawarthas is really really cold...I think it might start forming ice by December."
399957,singingdog,2009-11-06 11:45:00,1047,"Yep, Kawartha lakes are huge surface area, with very shallow water. Smaller lakes with depths over 50' will hold heat much longer than huge lakes with 10-20' depths."
400115,dada2727,2009-11-07 00:31:00,108,"cool thx, didn't know that but makes sense.  I was just trying to figure out when the herring start spawning, I've heard around 42 degrees but not sure."
400224,GBW,2009-11-07 19:34:00,8460,I can tell you 4 mile lake is 47.2 right now and man it's WINDY out there.
400337,muskeybugged,2009-11-08 05:00:00,282,Strange I had 45-47ÂºF on Pigeon today.
