399983,kemper,2009-11-06 13:59:00,2232,"Anyone out there that has a tip section to a Raven IM6 13'6"" float rod? Warranty will get me a fix...eventually but seeing as its prime season and my other float rods are way too weak for the big water I have been fishing (the raven is too but thats another issue) I need a quick fix. I COULD just cut about a foot out of it and repair it myself but that will kill my chances of EVER getting a replacement from Raven I'm sure.  Yes, I realize I am a loogan. Have your laugh, but seriously does anyone have a top section for the 13'6"" IM6  Thanks all  Kemper"
399986,BillM,2009-11-06 14:05:00,17367,"Time to upgrade?  lol  I have a 13'6 Raven IM6 as one of my spares, you are more then welcome to borrow the top section until your warranty replacement comes in.  Only prob is I'm in Barrie and you're in Whitby..."
399988,kemper,2009-11-06 14:07:00,2232,"Oh its been time to upgrade for a while but I am a student and well, its float rod or food. Tough decision I know, but a guys gotta eat!  Thanks for the offer Bill, Ill see what other options comes my way but I may just take you up on that"
399993,BillM,2009-11-06 14:19:00,17367,"Anytime man, let me know..."
399997,johnnyb,2009-11-06 14:26:00,3413,Wow...now THAT'S community
400033,kemper,2009-11-06 16:38:00,2232,"Fired it out for warranty, looks pretty good to me lifetime unconditional no matter how it breaks. Gonna cost me $30 and Ill have it back in two weeks....not bad."
400050,ironstone74,2009-11-06 18:25:00,201, Yep you said it!  That's good Karma Bill.  That'll get you five bonus fish your next trip out  Paul
400056,basskicker09,2009-11-06 18:38:00,144, get the float rod and keep some fish for food win win situation lol
400063,blaque,2009-11-06 19:09:00,2419," You do know thats the industry standard token answer for ""how long will a replacement take"". Its written in the sales rep./ customer service  handbook as the default answer to any question involving time lol.  Actually let me know how you make out..............i have an IM8 14' with a missing tip that i never got sent in over the summer (procrastination can be my weakness at times, more like just plain busy)"
400067,fishinguypat,2009-11-06 19:22:00,547,"well now your options are food,rod or gas money?"
400068,Raf,2009-11-06 19:29:00,3495,"i'm not familiar with float rods but if the tip is anything like a regular rod, i'd just take it into a decent tackle shop, pay $5 to get it replaced.  5 mins and it's done.  unless you are missing a few inches.. then please disregard."
400069,River Rat,2009-11-06 19:32:00,161,"Kemper, you can have mine till you get yours back....just don't eat it!  I live in the Shwa so I can drop it off, I don't think my PM works here so let me know where to meet you and when.  Cheers  RR"
400208,kemper,2009-11-07 18:41:00,2232," Thanks for the offer, but I probably need a couple weeks to get my school work done anyways.   The tackle shop  I dropped it off at is great and they said they were sending it out and that raven usually turns rods around for them same day? seemed strange to me too but I dont see why the tackle shop would have any reason to lie about it especially since I didnt even buy the rod there?"
400211,StoneFly,2009-11-07 18:50:00,574,"I ordered a new Raven 3 months ago and still havent seen it,..lol, but apparently its a new model, hope there are still fish around when I get it"
400212,kemper,2009-11-07 18:55:00,2232,RV9? Im interested in that rod.... but Im thinking a 14' IM9 is next
