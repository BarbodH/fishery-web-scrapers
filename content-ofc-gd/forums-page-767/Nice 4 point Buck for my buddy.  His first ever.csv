Maybe it was just beginners luck but he says he thinks he everything right.  He even called it in 3 buck noises and 2 doe moos (not sure what the proper terms are but I am pretty sure those are not them. lol). Tricky 40 yard shot but hit it perfectly.  It only ran for about 20 yards and died within minutes. Pictures were taken after he changed his clothes. Pretty good result.  not a huge dear but it was his first so he was stoked. I don't hunt (wife not a big fan of it) but he is my fishing partner so I shared in his excitement. "
