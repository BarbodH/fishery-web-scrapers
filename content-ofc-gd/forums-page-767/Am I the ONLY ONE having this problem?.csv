Even if its MY OWN POST...Ya know?? Anyway, it USED to show be a box with response inside, did I change any settings?? Or is everyone else is having this problem too?? It makes reading other's responses so much harder to find out??  Cripe! I hope I'm making sense here....   **PS: I'm sorry if someone posted this topic before**"
