400338,rbaquial,2009-11-08 05:47:00,968, Did you go today?? How recent is this?! ... I too was thinking of hitting BPS soon!

I have good luck on Cotton Cordell Wally Divers (not that they are cheap necessarily) and a fire tiger Frenzy thing that I can't seem to loose. My B-in-L swears by ""AC Shiners"" (again not cheap, but not Rapala either). It could have to do with a confidence level that you have with certain lures over others? Jim"
