399684,gogu392,2009-11-05 17:00:00,142,This question is for Muskie guys.  What specs should have a Muskie rod? How many Lb? What kind of action? How long?  Regards.
399685,Rizzo,2009-11-05 17:03:00,4754,pool cue - attach rope...just kidding. I picked up a Shimano Compre - 8 feet in length - at the musky odyssey earlier this year and I have been very happy with it. Cost is around 150.00
399686,Rizzo,2009-11-05 17:05:00,4754,"...that compre is actually my 4th rod. The rod you get (length, stiffness etc) depends on what you're using it for (trolling? casting? jerkbaits? bucktails? can you figure 8 with it?)"
399704,xeon,2009-11-05 18:18:00,350,Depends what lure you use. A generic would be 7-8ft Heavy-Xheavy. Look at some of the St.Croix Triumph rods to start with or move it up to a Premier. Hell even an Abu Ambassador will work. Definitly look at a bait caster that has a DEEP spool like a Shimano Curado 301 or any of the large bait cast reels. Look on spending atleast 300 for a decent setup.
399705,basskicker09,2009-11-05 18:18:00,144,i use a st. croix seven foot medium heavy with 80lb braid on an abu C3 i find it perfect for everything except trolling the big baits but im not right into musky like others on the board id just check the classifieds you will probably find a better deal
399724,Dabluz,2009-11-05 19:51:00,701,"  That's more for pike and big walleyes than for musky.  However, it will work for smaller muskies but not for the serious musky fisherman.  I would go for at least a heavy wieght rod of about 7 feet long.  Capable of casting big lures like ""Suicks"" and real big spinnerbaits.  A medium action rod with lots of backbone but can absorb shocks and not rip the lure from the fish's mouth.  I would also recommend the Curado 300 if there is going to be any casting done."
399726,Lunkerhunter,2009-11-05 19:56:00,455,i use the shimano compre 7'6 Heavy rod and i really enjoy it.  the reel i use is the abu record 61 reel..  65 pound test as i generally only fish scugog for muskie and i doubt i will ever land something even close to 50.  soo i figure 65 will be good enough.   in the mid summer i use a 7 foot extra heavy so i can make sure i can pull the big boys out from the weeds.  much harder to cast with this rod though.  cheers
399773,jediangler,2009-11-05 22:32:00,1923,"I fish the Kawarthas for musky and use a Berkeley Gorilla Stick 6'6"" MH with an ABU 5600C4 reel spooled with 65lb PP. I only throw bucktails, slopmaster spinnerbaits and troll smaller baits."
399776,mistaredone,2009-11-05 22:37:00,913,"  Nothing wrong with Rod D's set up its actually pretty versitile.  big lures like ""Suicks"" Ha!!!"
399904,Pigeontroller,2009-11-06 03:19:00,2793,"As stated their are many different Muskie Set-ups, rods/reels that are specific to Bucktails, Jerkbaits/Glidebaits, Trolling...Etc. A good starting point, or if one rod is all you ever plan on owning would be a (length of your choice) 7-8 foot, MHF, 1 1/2-3 oz. rod."
399965,pikeie,2009-11-06 12:13:00,380,"if you think suicks are big, try tossing a Grunt haha 18"" long crankbait, more for trolling but man the can be deadly when casted!"
400157,Rizzo,2009-11-07 04:19:00,4754,ya I used to think suicks were big too...now I throw them when I need a break!
