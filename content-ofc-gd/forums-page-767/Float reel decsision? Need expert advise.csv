400077,super dave,2009-11-06 20:45:00,323,You can gently tap out your bearings on the islander.  just be carefuly not to dent the seal.  I believe islander puts in the bearing with a bit of blue locktight. Something I do to make my islander spin a bit better is to put a TINY dab of locktight on the thread of the screw and tighten only until you don't get any play in the reel.  Let the lock tight dry and the screw is set.  You can still get the screw off with a little bit of force but its on there tight enough that it won't come loose while fishing.  Just be sure not to use the red lock tight.  I think that stuff is permanent.
400084,solopaddler,2009-11-06 21:45:00,8605," An alternative to loctight, simply wrap a small piece of 4lb test mono around the screw and put it in to a point where the reel spins good. Trim off the ends and you're good to go."
400120,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-07 01:00:00,10439,  That's a great idea!!!!!!
400123,Radnine,2009-11-07 01:27:00,1538,"Thanks for asking, as I am an expert. It matters not what you buy, they will all be garbage in a year or two after you lay it in the water while you take photos. Or as twenty morons step on it while you all fight for your square yard of river bank. Best wishes! Jim"
400124,StoneFly,2009-11-07 01:30:00,574,LMAO
400126,super dave,2009-11-07 01:54:00,323,Some fly tying thread works well too.
400133,BillM,2009-11-07 02:23:00,17367,"   Jim, I'll make sure to take as many pics as I can of my reel completely immersed in the water."
400175,NAC,2009-11-07 13:25:00,369," Provided it is a reputable maufacturer, the bearings and spool dia are all that really matter when it comes right down to it and the rest is just windowdressing.  So why not go with the light one? I see the new Okuma Sheffield has an internal drag.  Why? is it for beginners?  So you set it in the range of a 8lb fish and hook an 18lb, what good is the drag then when you have try to set it while line is peeling out....  ouch!  The old dragless model is $100 cheaper at around $230.  no, I'm not an expert either....."
399731,bassjnkie,2009-11-05 20:16:00,1101,"I had 2 entry level float reels in the past that I never gave them a chance because I had no time, so I sold them. I figure I have a lot of time to figure out the reel now, so I am looking for one. The problem is I know nothing when it comes to these reels and to me they all look and function the same. I went to a bunch shops and got 10 different suggestions and I'm still confused. What do you suggest? I don't want a super light reel like the SST3 but I'm not looking for a heavy reel. It's going to be used for everything from small trout to big carp using light lines. So far the No.1 suggestion is the SST2."
399740,kemper,2009-11-05 20:31:00,2232,"I run the SST-3 and although its no kingpin it is a hell of a reel and can be had for a great price.  Overall, cant go wrong with an islander but it all comes down to preference"
399771,msp,2009-11-05 22:30:00,1336,"  I thought that he said "" expert advice """
399775,kemper,2009-11-05 22:35:00,2232, Never claimed to be an expert...guess he will have to disregard what  I have said and wait for the real experts to chime in
399779,StoneFly,2009-11-05 22:42:00,574,"Lol,..you guys are funny,...Im no expert either and I have only used one type of Pin and that would be the islander."
399798,buckster,2009-11-05 23:08:00,530,G Loomis or tournament drifters are solid reels.   They wont break the bank either.   I might have one for sale if interested
399805,bassjnkie,2009-11-05 23:23:00,1101,"Just got back, I went to see the SST-2 and SST-3 and they are both nice reels. The 3 is lighter than I thought and the 2 is the perfect weight. Stone I was thinking about the Islander, but can't find anyone that sell them. Buster I am looking to buy new for now, but I could be interested buying used. Can you send me a picture of the reels."
399806,Kinger,2009-11-05 23:23:00,351,"I'm buying a Kingpin Royalty 478 in March.  I can't wait.    With a last name ""King"", how could I NOT get a Kingpin?"
399815,MJL,2009-11-05 23:43:00,2427,"Hey Dan  If you're looking for an Islander new, some stores you can check out not too far from Toronto include (But not limited to) - Natural Sports - Angling Specialties -Tightlines - BPS at one time had a few...Not sure if they do now  Islanders are great reels...Had mine for ages and it has never let me down.  My only gripe is I think the clicker was designed more for people who retrieve with their right hand (at least on mine) - Clicker lets line out much easier than it is to wind in."
399825,bassjnkie,2009-11-06 00:05:00,1101,"Thanks Mike, Angling Specialty, I totally forgot to check them out today. They close at 9 think I'll check it out."
399877,DRIFTER_016,2009-11-06 02:26:00,10439,  I agree. I used an original Drifter as my main reel for 15 years and it is still in my collection. They're solid reels that are bullet proof. Mine has been stomped in the mud and dropped/thrown and bounced off rocks and it still runs like a top!!!
399882,BillM,2009-11-06 02:36:00,17367, You'll come out of there with a lighter wallet!!!!  I love my Ang Spec.
399893,msp,2009-11-06 03:04:00,1336,Im just teasing you buddy! I meant no offence
399899,justin elia,2009-11-06 03:11:00,151,Ive been reviewing the Islander for the past year.  I wrote a review on WFN if you want to read it.  www.wfn.tv/blog/justin  Great reel for the money.  Upgrade bearings though if you get it.
399901,StoneFly,2009-11-06 03:16:00,574,"If your in woodbridge, just drive down Hwy 7 past keele 200m and you are there on the north side. the guy isnt overly friendly and he will watch you like you are stealing with an unlite smoke in his mouth,...but he has some quality stuff, many pins,..I think I saw and islander in the display case.  just for fun ask him if he has any bulk steelhead roe....lol  he seems to get uptight, maybe becasue his wife is tying the bags all day to sell for $6/doz...lol, but if you really want it,..just lean on him....  take a look at the floats he has behind the counter, riverwood,..good stuff;)."
399902,StoneFly,2009-11-06 03:18:00,574," I have heard many times about upgrading the bearings with an islander,..due to start up etc,...I think after 2 years I undersand why.. in Frog water conditions etc. ,...how does one go about upgrading them?"
399906,justin elia,2009-11-06 03:28:00,151," Contact Islander, Im sure they will ship them to you or ask your local shop to order them for you.  If you run into any problems, let me know and I'll ask my contact at Islander to help you out."
399907,wallacio,2009-11-06 03:28:00,475,"Islander bearings are press fit and as such, Islander strongly recommends that the reel be returned to the point of sale so that the reel can be returned to them and they'll swap out the old bearings for the upgrades (to ensure that it's done properly and no damage occurs)."
399916,StoneFly,2009-11-06 03:51:00,574, Is ther somewhere I can just pay to have it done ?  Im pretty lazy about that stuff lol.
399917,StoneFly,2009-11-06 03:53:00,574," that sounds like an offseason thin which is like 7 months away,...is there a 24 hour turnaround dealio?"
399919,wallacio,2009-11-06 04:03:00,475,"Not that I'm aware of but you could ask at shops that sell them for alternatives to shipping back to Islander.  That said, is it really something that is so pressing that can't wait until the off-season?   Given that your bearings are only two years old, I'm sure they still work just fine."
399926,StoneFly,2009-11-06 04:27:00,574," its not the age,...its the froggie water in a few holes i fish,..my buddies tell me the upgarded bearings will help the drift a bit,...maybe cleaning it will too lol.....but your right its not that pressing at all....was just curious...if DMASSE would ever get his pudlenut*** out of hiding he could do it,...but silly marriage stuff....lol"
399977,bassjnkie,2009-11-06 13:44:00,1101,Thanks everyone. From the replies I decided to go with the Islander (new or used) or the Tournament Drifter and upgrade the bearings. Thanks again for all the great info.
399984,BillM,2009-11-06 14:01:00,17367,"Don't make a decision until you've held the reels in your hand...   No need to rush this decision, gotta remember you'll have this thing for quite a while."
399989,kemper,2009-11-06 14:08:00,2232,"I dont know if its been said yet, but take your rod in when youre buying a reel...a reel that looks good in a case isnt always the one that feels right on the rod"
