It's hard to keep losing weight when you are down wind of the chip truck, fish fryer and sausage wagon    By accident, a couple of days of helping my buddy out turned into a hectic, yet fun, summer However, yesterday was my last for the season under beautiful blue skies.  St Jacobs is really a unique marketplace, and, a lot of fun.     The silly grin comes from having sold just about everything we had in the truck. Not a bad way to end the season."

Knowing your interests I can only assume you felt right at home there and probably looked forward to it every weekend. Sounds like a dream job to me.  Take care of yourself in the off season and next St Jacob's ""season"" will be here before you know it."
