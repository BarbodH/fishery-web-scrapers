400548,Skud,2009-11-09 03:19:00,739,I sat in my blind Saturday morning for three hours and in the afternoon for a couple. Then again this morning. No Whitetail to be seen. The Ruffled Grouse continues to walk about teasing me.  I resisted putting an arrow through it so not to blow my cover for the sake of making it dinner.  I guess the controlled hunt got the deer spooked.  The warm temps and bright moon are not helping either.  I did put my trail cam back out Friday afternoon. A few doe came around at night only. Here is a pic of a mature and young doe.    I also have a new visitor. Might make it dinner too.     I may go out mid week if the camera starts to show some daytime activity.

I have only gotten out once; yesterday afternoon Sue was feeling sorry for me being so house bound she insisted I should just get out so I headed out to my stand about 1:00 pm. The tree has growen a couple of inches so I had to reposition the stand but once done I hunkered down and just enjoyed the sun and light breeze. I had birds landing in the tree right beside me, watched a squirel running back and forth and then he climbed to within about 6' of me, then I nodded off. I woke up about 3:30 feeling totally relaxed and thought ""perfect, just in time for the hunt"". I didn't see any deer but it was a much needed rest.  I think I will have to get one of those trail cameras, man those photos are fantastic, thanks for sharing! Anyone want to trade a good trail camera for an Aquaview?"

Im going to move it back to the field.Just want to see if my bucks are still around.   I talked to the land owner today at work. His brother,who ownes the property accross the road,had told him, he had a run in with some of the hunters.They pulled the same crap that they did with me 2 years ago.We have permission from the land owner.Thier pop (the land owners that is).He,s been gone 30 years. Im trying to secure this property. I have a date to talk with his brother again.Not sure I can stop the tresspassing,but if they know someone is out there,like they do on the property I hunt,they may not return.   Amazing the ignorance out there.   Take the grouse.It,s spooking the deer.LOL"
