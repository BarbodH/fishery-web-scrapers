400047,Fishnwire,2009-11-06 18:00:00,983,"Around the end of August I noticed that a little hunt camp was set up on the road into my camp.  It consisted of an old Winnebago (1970's) and a brand new camper trailer.  They were located in a little clearing right next to the road, way the heck in there.  It was a couple weeks early for moose season, but some guys set their camps up a week or two early so that everything is ready for the hunt.  The thing is that I got a funny vibe from the whole set up.  I can't even put my finger on why, but I just thought something was fishy with these guys from day one.  I never saw any people there but I could usually see that activity had taken place...they would leave stuff laying around the sight, like a gas can or a table and there were empty water bottles and stuff laying around.  While the road is not part of my property, I have the only camp at the end of it.  There are a couple of locals that sometimes go in there but I know most of them, and this little set up somehow didn't belong there.  A little over a week ago I was heading into camp and I notice that the Winnebago is gone.  I thought it was odd that they'd leave the brand new camper trailer and take out the ancient motorhome first, but that's what they did.  Two days later I'm coming out and when I get to the strange camp I see that the brand new camper is burned right to the ground.  I got off my quad and had a quick look around, but the term ""crime scene"" came to mind, so I touched nothing.  When I got back to town, I called the cops to report it.  I spoke with some receptionist who took down all the info.  I told her I suspected something illegal was going on there.  They were there right at weed harvest time or could have been poachers.  For all I know the place was a drug lab and its toxic.  At the very least, common sense suggests that  the trailer is almost certainly stolen.  I gave her as best a description I could as to where it was located, but these roads don't have names or appear on any map.  She told me an officer would contact me and I might be asked to escort him up there to investigate.  Well it's been over a week and I've heard nothing.  It's possible they figured out where the place is based on my description, but I highly doubt it.  The thing is that you would think they would be obligated to go out there and do some form of investigation.  How do they know there's nothing of interest there unless they actually go there?  I wonder how often public complaints and reports are simply ignored, because this is the third time in my life I reported something suspicious or made a complaint to the police and in each instance, absolutely nothing came about as a result.  They took down the info I gave them and then did nothing, fully dropping the matter every time.  I guess the next time I see something that I think the authorities would want to know about, I'll just mind my own business and not waste my time.  The thing is that I'd feel better if they would come out and look things over, but what can I do?  The old saying ""Boy, do I feel safe."" comes to mind.  If anyone wants the location of a secluded bush road where the cops refuse to go to that would be perfect for any number of illegal activeties, I know just the spot."
400048,bubbles,2009-11-06 18:22:00,591,"That seems odd, but you never know the cops may know the area very well, and went there already.  When is the next time you will be back?"
400051,Fishnwire,2009-11-06 18:26:00,983, Probably not for a week or more.  My sister and bro-in-law are in town from Texas with my niece.  I don't think I'll go in until they head home.  I might whip out there just to have a look around in a day or two.
400053,Roy,2009-11-06 18:35:00,13728,"Sometimes, cops will let things slide because there are bigger fish to fry. Right now, if indeed it was illegal activity, they might just be gathering facts and working their way up the chain of command."
400054,irishfield,2009-11-06 18:36:00,26272,Might have been the cops camp....
400062,Fishnwire,2009-11-06 19:03:00,983,  Alright.  That made me laugh.

400080,irishfield,2009-11-06 21:11:00,26272,Trust me.. I've seen weirder stuff North of #17 !
400107,Greencoachdog,2009-11-07 00:08:00,8163,Some GPS coordinates for the suspect camp might get the police a little more interested...
400189,smally21,2009-11-07 14:52:00,993,"until the owner of damaged or stolen property reports a problem there is no ""investigation"" as there is no complainant.  the ""crime"" that may have taken place has no victim as yet. just a thought as to the lack of interest."
400201,Fishnwire,2009-11-07 17:57:00,983,"  If the trailer is stolen, then whomever it was stolen from almost certainly already reported it.  If you were missing a trailer and had reported that to the police, and then you found out the police had received a tip about a destroyed trailer in the bush but had not investigated the matter...how would you feel?  Why are people always so eager to make excuses and give the benefit of doubt to the cops?  Maybe they're busy, maybe they're waiting to receive a complaint, maybe they're whatever...maybe they just didn't feel like doing anything about it because they don't like work.  I'm not saying that's the case, but why do so many people automatically feel that whatever actions (or lack there of) that the police take...it MUST be for a good reason.  Aren't they human beings and fallible just like the rest of us?  My wife's nephew was one of the most spoiled, laziest, stupidest (not to mention prejudiced) kids you could ever hope to meet and he became an RCMP officer last year.  They may have a good training program, but they didn't have a lot to start with when it came to this guy.  The day he graduated from the academy and became a cop I realized that these men and women are far from super-heroes.  They are average (and in some cases, less than average) people who are just as capable of screwing up royally as you and me.  Sorry for the rant, but like I say...I'm always surprised just how many people are eager to wipe the rear-ends of law enforcement."
400415,Billy Bob,2009-11-08 21:04:00,5865,"Just like any other business or organization you have the good the bad and the ugly.......I am not calling your peace officers any of these because I don't know them. But I will say you are judging them without any proof that they didn't do their jobs at hand.....  I see no reason you can't call the same number that you called to report this suspicious activity to follow up what was done.  All you have to do is explain you have property in the area and because of this incident you are concerned about the safety of your property, yourself and your family.....I also believe it would be better to contact these authorities in person rather than on the phone. At least this is how I would approach the problem...now if indeed nothing was done then you have every right to go higher up on the ladder be it within the police department or your local politician.  Please keep us posted.  Bob"
400461,Fishnwire,2009-11-08 23:49:00,983,"The more that I think about it...it's possible they found their way out there on their own.  I suppose I'd have no way of knowing if they did or not.  I guess I shouldn't assume the worst, but like I mentioned, there have been other occasions (completely unrelated) over the years when I made a report or complaint and didn't get any response.  I guess a burnt out trailer is nothing to be too worried about, so maybe I shouldn't even care.  I can't expect that they would notify me of their progress...I guess I was in a bad mood when I ranted."
