400321,GBW,2009-11-08 03:21:00,8460,"fish it with big baits, sloooow and low (AKA deep)."
400344,siwash,2009-11-08 11:54:00,683,there are no fish at the toronto islands...
400347,yakpiker,2009-11-08 13:07:00,160,"IMHO...this late in the season, save yourself some time and coin by fishing along harbourfront instead of taking the ferry to the island...bring a net with a handle in case you get lucky...try fishing the island in the spring"
400350,chandru,2009-11-08 13:16:00,63,"ok cool advice thanks guys but where along the harbourfront? never been there either, unless it was just driving right by. are there access points to the shore or is it all accessible? i appreciate all the help!"
400363,yakpiker,2009-11-08 14:14:00,160,Anywhere along the waterfront from Bathurst to Yonge Streets is pretty much parkland/public grounds and suitable for fishing...look for the green weedbeds and you might find pike.
400374,chandru,2009-11-08 14:51:00,63,thankyou for the specific info. that's awsome!
400498,chandru,2009-11-09 01:35:00,63,any more info out there? all is appreciated! i have no car so local spots will have to do for now...
