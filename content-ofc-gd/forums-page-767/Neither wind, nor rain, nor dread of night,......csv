Off to the stagnating town of Welland in search of perchies. Took a while, but found the perch and gills all schooled together in a feeding frenzy. Guess the weather front turned on the appetite. Kept me a decent number for dinner.    As usual, a lot of fun. Also indulged in another one of my bad habits; going for a flying leap  Ground sure was hard this time."
