400259,redneck666,2009-11-07 23:48:00,563,not too bad. about the only thing i've caught in the past week is a .5lb smallie Haha!
400425,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-08 22:34:00,0,fished for about an hour and a half this afternoon because it was sooooo warm.  got into some clearwater beauties.  got some nice pics of my friend dave's beauty.    
400574,snag,2009-11-09 05:32:00,1932,"Thought this might be a ""run-on"" thread.   But, your friends additional pics prevail.  Nice spots Doc.  Mas' por favour!"
396083,StoneFly,2009-10-24 22:25:00,574," But some Clear Up REAL fast,...Im sure quite a few guys on here know what Im sayin.  Its all about the beds, sand, silt, clay and gravel all settle at different rates.  I have seen some rivers clear up in a matter of hours actually while I was fishing them.    If anyone mentions any trib names here,..you are a true IDIOT!!!"
396084,highdrifter,2009-10-24 22:42:00,2534, Michipicoten!!  A bit harsh doncha think??

396105,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-25 01:09:00,0,"one of the few other pics today when it wasn't raining, snowing, or both! factor in the 25-30k winds coming off superior and she was a tough day to control a float...  small pebble tribs further north were running much clearer...  with the exception of the leafs swirling everywhere in the pool!! "
396119,BillM,2009-10-25 01:59:00,17367,"Wow, looks like that fish has been in the river for a while!"
396125,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-25 02:26:00,0,their run is mostly done.  despite all the rain this trib was still real clear however.  beautiful salmonid stream.
397260,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-29 01:09:00,0,managed to snap a pic using the old rock tripod... the fishing was greatly improved this evening...  
397290,StoneFly,2009-10-29 01:57:00,574," Looks like rain again this Friday coming,...probably better to head out friday am if possible,...Im lookin forward to it,..I dont know why it is but the fish seem turn on during a light rain,"
397315,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-29 02:46:00,0,"this is what prepping for steelheading sounds like... early bird gets the worm right? nothing that timmy ho's, baileys, and some good tunes can't fix!  "
397320,troutologist,2009-10-29 02:55:00,951,  Wow is it ever up still hey just like 2007 when we got that gully washer in sept. It fished good right into winter.
397332,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-29 03:17:00,0,yeah.  up into the trees.  makes picture taking SUPER hard because there isn't anything to do with the fish but grab them.  i got this photo using the ol' wabos rock tripod.
397343,Kinger,2009-10-29 03:33:00,351,"I could have snapped one if I hadn't wandered off or if I was brave enough to cross where you did, you're a certified insane man!"
397359,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-29 04:17:00,0,did the water get up your skirt?
397398,Kinger,2009-10-29 12:11:00,351,"Haha, a little."
397405,Dara,2009-10-29 12:42:00,3052,"  You fish with guys that wear skirts now?  Well, that marriage didn't last"
397406,Kinger,2009-10-29 12:46:00,351,"I feel kinda strange after reading that LOL. I tuck it into my waders, I swear."
397425,troutologist,2009-10-29 13:59:00,951,The doc has the wrong build for effective wading.  On the other hand my fat ass can remain anchored in the heaviest flows.  Luc you missed an epic cross to the to the center island of the moose carcass this spring in flood. Got a couple nice fish off the inside seam of the V. But you would have ended up in whitefish bay.    ps bring a net. wading staff and excellent solo landing tool
397435,Kinger,2009-10-29 14:21:00,351,"I think I will get a wading staff.  I'm all of 140 lbs and 6 feet tall, doesnt take much before i'm swimming lol."
397454,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-29 15:20:00,0,"jay,  my frame is the perfect balance of weight and drag in the water for wading. place these variables upon a graph and you will see me within the optimum range.  therefore,  while you are catching water like a drift sock, i cut through the h20 like a sea kayak.  even if i could feel my feet lifting off the cobble yesterday...  sometimes the fish are where the rubber boot army won't go."
398218,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-31 23:00:00,0,"water in full spring flood today...unreal how much water is pumping through some of the tribs... managed to pick up a few fish in the tailouts today.  water was so dirty couldn't get a hit on roe.  bumped some fish on 4"" berkley steelhead worms in bubblegum, and a small crappie sized tube jig in chartreuse.  here's the little skip i took a picture of with some real nice photos my friend took to come shortly...  "
398254,redneck666,2009-11-01 02:44:00,563,not bad. alot better than im doin...... but thats because im not out haha. good luck on the next trip.    JP
398361,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-01 18:45:00,0,some more high water steel...   
400254,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-07 23:19:00,0,fished a few hours in gin this morning...  finally got into fish by fishing jigs  on a 6 foot fluoro leader... saw one other fish caught on the river.  not very large either...  here's a few pics i managed.    
394623,troutologist,2009-10-20 02:50:00,951,Thats my rock get off that spot!!!
394625,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-20 02:54:00,0,git back to yo catfish boy
394626,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-20 02:55:00,0,should i fuzz that out of the picture?
394629,troutologist,2009-10-20 03:05:00,951,Into the winter or early in the spring thats the first spot to thaw thats easy to fish other than the top hole that everyone is at.
394630,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-20 03:12:00,0,i like it just because there is seldom any body fishing it ( you can't reach it with a pair of green rubbers )
394953,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-21 01:36:00,0,whipped up the highway again today for a few hours.  small chromers poking their noses in.  a few cooler days and some rain are making this weekend look real promising.  
394956,Dara,2009-10-21 01:39:00,3052,Are you using a fly rod with fuzz balls or float rod and roe bags?
394957,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-21 01:40:00,0,float rod
394960,Dara,2009-10-21 01:45:00,3052,I just may break out the fly rod this weekend...cept I gotta open the hunt camp for my son to celebrate his 20th with 20 friends I guess just the power plant in the boat for a couple hours
394962,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-21 01:46:00,0,sounds like a good party to crash!!! where's the party?
394966,Dara,2009-10-21 01:54:00,3052,Bar W hunt club...st joes
395651,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-23 01:24:00,0,"Got out for 2 hours again this evening...One little fish and one real nice fish broke off...Lot's of little skips in the river, not a lot of real big fish.  Guessing it's early but i could also be due to the lextremely low water conditions in fall between 2003-2006.  Fight Shot     Little 'bow "
395664,BillM,2009-10-23 01:46:00,17367,That thing looks like a missle!
395669,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-23 01:55:00,0,"a little missile, but a missile indeed almost reminded me of a droppie...  let's hope some bigger fish start coming in the river."

395811,anders,2009-10-23 17:25:00,1168,I thought smelts only ran in the spring...my bad
395823,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-23 18:52:00,0,that's a lot of mouth for a guy who hasn't posted any steel.

"
392643,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 20:33:00,0,"On Thanksgiving Monday, I went on a fishing/scouting trips of the tribs between Wawa and Sault Ste. Marie.  After a stop at tim horton's (with a healthy splash of Bailey's) we were on our way up the highway by quarter past five.  About 7:30 we arrived at the michipicoten.  We fished the morning with very limited success.  We caught a few small resident bows on roe.  A few other folks were fishing the river that morning reported seeing a few straggler salmon but not much in the way of fall steel.  After a quick stop for lunch in Wawa we made our way back towards Sault Ste. Marie.  We stopped at a few tribs on the way through Lake Superior Park and found more of the same.  Each of the rivers was still full of coho salmon.  After not getting any steel on the float rod all morning, i took out the spinning gear to take a few casts...A few minutes later I got into a coho.  By this point the wind coming off superior had coupled with some rain, making fishing most uncomfortable.  Given the fact the rivers were low and that we didn't see any steelies, we decided to return to town for a nap.  Hopefully by next weekend the steel shall arrive in full force!   "
392650,troutologist,2009-10-13 20:49:00,951,Be a few weeks yet. Did you check the water temps? Even with low flow there seems to be a magic number for the hwy plaque...  By the looks of things Grandma K. didnt get dinner?
392658,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 21:07:00,0," granny isn't too big on salmon or coho! she prefers the fine flavour of the salvelinus clan. tribs last week were hovering around 15c in the day around the sault, so i assume the ones further up the highway would be at least comparable if not lower.  the 'ho the other day hadn't dropped her eggs yet so i look forward to that getting going!"
392718,TDunn,2009-10-13 23:07:00,680,Must have been a nice drive up H17 on monday Dr S.... Nice colours on the coho.... I went up the highway around noon till 2 today to check the chip out....Water was low but fishable as Im sure you seen.... I was looking for a coho but hit this steelie instead....Not complaining especially since this fish will be smoked! mmmmm.....    Been to Speckled Trout?  TDunn
392720,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-13 23:16:00,0, nice fish!!  looks like it's on!  chip and goulais always seem to get fish weeks earlier than the other tribs! guess i'll have to check'r out!  watch for me up there! didn't stop at speckled trout.  there was 2 cars there already although my bud was saying it's still full of 'hos in the riffles.
392740,troutologist,2009-10-14 00:04:00,951,STC is still rife with fresh cohos
392749,Greencoachdog,2009-10-14 00:31:00,8163,Who says you have to catch big fish to have fun?!!!
392772,Dara,2009-10-14 01:25:00,3052,  I'm sure it was you that coined that phrase...I know you sure live it  Nice going guys...whats the Goulais like around where it crosses 17...I have some riverfront property there and never fished it yet
392779,StoneFly,2009-10-14 01:42:00,574,"Nice Going Guys, does it seem late for the Chromage up there this year?  With the exception of last year, this is the latest in quite a few that I recall, down here atleast.  Damn its cold enough now,..one more good rain  P.S, Diggity Dawg, Big Fish are more Fun"

392808,StoneFly,2009-10-14 02:28:00,574, Is that a chanell Cat?  where is all the snow for Jan 12?  lol  J/K
392811,Greencoachdog,2009-10-14 02:59:00,8163,  That would be the highly elusive Pylodictis Olivaris (Flathead Catfish)... define snow???
393039,StoneFly,2009-10-14 22:32:00,574,"Do those Cats have much fight in them?  I havent ever caught any big ones, but anytime I was too lazy to get out and do some real fishing I would go to the closest swampy water body (holland Marsh for example) and do some armchair fishing, caught many smaller cats, but their fight sucks,....the sting on the other hand,..ouch.  lol...oops, just realized that a Coho/Steelhead report has turned into a Catfish story,..LOL  Sorry Doc.  Nice Fish"
393046,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-14 22:45:00,0,Looks like a nice clean fish caught in crystal clear water. You didn't eat it? I would have smoked that baby! I too always stop at Tim Hortons on the way to fishing and on the way back. I will pass countless coffee shops until I find a timmies. Thanks for sharing.
393050,Greencoachdog,2009-10-14 22:49:00,8163,"  To keep it short I'll just say that these are river fish that fight current most of their life, and if you have crappy tackle they'll take it away from you!"
393060,StoneFly,2009-10-14 23:03:00,574, But Doesnt most of the water they live in have next to no current?  How do they compare lb for lb to salmon or Steelhead?
393183,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-15 03:44:00,0,hit the chip tonight.  first fish on reminded me that i hadn't fought a fish on the 'pin since june and made a fool of me.  landed the second fish though and it was a real beaut.  nice 5 lb chromer...  a gent down the shore caught one that from a distance looked like it must be 10 lbs. near the end of the night a guy using a large spinner fished a tailout downstream of me and caught 4 fish in about 10 minutes... not the best evening i've had but man was it good to get a fish on the float rod.
393339,Leecher,2009-10-15 16:19:00,7832,Great report and pics Dr. Salvelinus Thanks for sharing Leechman
393578,Greencoachdog,2009-10-16 03:13:00,8163,"  These fish are predators, one of the best baits for them is a live 6-8"" Bluegill (legal here) they're found on main river channels and river channel/creek channel junctions... I'm pretty sure they would sodomize a Salmon, and do even worse things to one of those overweight Rainbow Troot!!!  I doubt seriously that you would be able to land one on one of your clothesline pulley/buggy whip combos!!!"
393640,StoneFly,2009-10-16 13:11:00,574," LMAO, so lb for lb you are saying those eeewy geewy catfish are stronger than salmon or Steelhead?"
393652,Dara,2009-10-16 13:38:00,3052, I think they're just slugs...the catfish I mean
393658,troutologist,2009-10-16 13:59:00,951,"Caught my first decent sized channel this summer (~15lbs). They fight like heck. No jumps obviously but they sure pull and are tough to convince to leave the bottom.  I'd still rather steelhead fish, but cats are quite a fight."
