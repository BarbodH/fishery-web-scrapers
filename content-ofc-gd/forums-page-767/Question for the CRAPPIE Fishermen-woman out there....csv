I picked up a few Crappie Jigs... and I'm thinking of 2 possible ways of rigging this...  1) Straight mainline to jig...  OR...  2) With a float.  Now, here's what I am thinking... I should be able to get away with both tactics, but I'm thinking this jig was meant for a specific type of setup?? I dunno HERE  is what it looks like.  Any insight on this particular jig would be much appreciated.  Thanks in Advance, A2F"
400511,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-09 02:03:00,2582,A buddy I fish with kills perch and crappie with those. And he fishes them as a cast and retrieve without a float. He has the touch for it. I do not. Or rather I just find it much easier under a float. When we fish together it is a friendly competition to see who puts more fish in the boat. When the water is warmer he tends to outfish me. But when the water is cold I tend to do better under the float.  Both work. Just pick which you are most comfortable with and good luck.
400531,Guest skeeter99,2009-11-09 02:39:00,0, hopefully you got the chartreuse head pink body (wink!!  wink!!!) absolutely deadly in summer and winter in the kawarthas  use a slip float you can cast and reel in and jig with one setup
400549,Handlebarz,2009-11-09 03:21:00,3790,I like the wing it slip floats they are great for long cast's and you can work the bait when its under the float  I see that BPS does not carry them any more but here is a link to there site to show you what they are http://reviews.basspro.com/2010/15819/reviews.htm
400551,bassjnkie,2009-11-09 03:24:00,1101,I use the same jigs under a slip float.
400581,Stern Rules,2009-11-09 07:19:00,342,"I share your thoughts of Bass Pro. I love it too. I also got some of those slap daddies but haven's used them yet. The only time I wouldn't use the float is when I'm using a spinner. Otherwise, I use a slip float. Sometimes twitching it helps to get hits unless using live bait. If you don't use a float with those light jigs, don't plan on getting a long cast unless using very light line. I'd definately recommend the float."
