227668,JeffBornFishin,2008-07-15 00:07:00,260,"OK after a totally crappy Sunday I couldn't wait to get on Pigeon today.  8 AM start and the weather looked good      Opened her up and I was on the first bass spot south end of Pigeon in 30 minutes    I said I was gonna burn gas.  Very quiet on the water only one or two boats out.  No luck at the first spot so I decided to try a new spot.  10 FOW on a weedline.  Wind was going just the right way so I tossed out the driftsock.  After a couple of minutes got this nice bass.      After that it was more smaller bass, a crap load of perch and then came Wally.      Let that one go cast again and whammo.     Got another one similar size.  Lost a bigger one right at the boat  Next up to my suprise was a Rock Bass on a large spinner.    Kept changing up lures and techniques to make it more interesting.  I must have made the same pass 8 times over the same line.     A few more bass and then all the action stopped dead with a major shift in the wind.  I tried some other spots but only got some taps.  Good enough for me.  Was a great day despite the heavy wind and I didn't get rainned on.  Here is a couple more bass from today.     I may head back to Pigeon tomorrow and try again. :Gonefishing:I got a full tank ready to go"
227671,Greencoachdog,2008-07-15 00:11:00,8163,Nice report and pics!!!  The fish don't have to be huge to have fun eh!!!
227677,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-15 00:21:00,3761,"Nice report, btw how does that red crank bait work in the 7th picture with the walleye. I was looking at that exact bait and was not sure if it was worth my purchase."
227679,JeffBornFishin,2008-07-15 00:22:00,260,  No Sir!  More fun to catch lots of frisky fighters than spend 8 hours and catch one big fish.
227680,tbayboy,2008-07-15 00:25:00,1497,"Great report, very cool pictures with the lures.  Thanks"
227682,JeffBornFishin,2008-07-15 00:27:00,260,"  It is one of my ""go to"" crankbaits on a partly overcast dark and windy day.  Got lots of bass on it.  Was suprised the first walleye nailed it hard.  This is a pic from 2007.  Look at how small the bass is.  This lure drives 'em nutz   The other pic shows a new patern Rapala Tail Dancer in ""bleeding olive"".  Got it this past winter.  Here is a good pic of it from today:    I like changing up especially when you keep working the same water."

227807,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-15 11:33:00,0,Great Report. The fish seem to be really active on pigeon and you seem to be catching them using various baits. Good Job! Thanks for sharing.
