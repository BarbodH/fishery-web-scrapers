215785,JohnF,2008-06-15 20:39:00,3494," Doubt that it matters who I want to win. It looks like Tiger's playing a very hot hand at the moment. The combination of his skill and the luck he had yesterday are likely unbeatable. It's hard not to be impressed with his game most of the time.  I'd like to see Westwood win. I don't like Mediate. I've seen him in action personally and he was a prick. Of course being a lefty I'm always rooting for Phil but he's struggling.  Unless Tiger's knee packs up I bet he's gonna roll to a win, probably by a few strokes.  JF"
