227656,Meely,2008-07-14 23:28:00,282,"As I had a few more small jobs to complete up at the cottage last weekend, I hadn't planned on getting out on the lake to try my luck.  Most of Saturday was spent re-arranging furniture and putting together some new furniture I had purchased from IKEA....(Gotta love IKEA !!) Called it quits on Saturday evening and decided to try our luck...... .......Fished for 2 hours....NADDA !!  Sunday, we managed to get all the work done by 11 am and decided to  head out and try our luck again.   We began working a section of the north end of the lake again as this area had produced some nice fish for us.  5 Minutes after beginning......my buddy nails this little gem......Really aggressive strike as she had more than half the lure in her mouth.     We fished for another 2 hours or so and 5 minutes before we decided to call it quits, Buckster nails this nice fish very close to Big Island.......    Again, boated her, quick pic and away she went !!  So, in all.....it was a very productive weekend. Got most of the work completed and managed to get 3 to 4 hours on the water as well.  Thanks for reading,  Meely"
