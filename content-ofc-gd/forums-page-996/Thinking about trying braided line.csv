My only concern is that the braided line seems far more visible that the mono line Im using.  I would rather not use any leaders when I fish...I dont like tying line directly to line.  Can I go from the braided line direct to a swivel/lure? Wouldn't using a leader diminish the value of the strength of the braided line?  just tyring to figure this out before I spend the 20 bux on the line...  All the best,  Jack"
228094,GBW,2008-07-15 20:13:00,8460,"Hi Jack.  There is many great conversations that have been had over braided line on this board.  Here are a few for you.  poll on line type braided line fishing line  Just make sure you use mono as a backing when you spool braided on...  PS, welcome to the site. Geoff"

228149,misfish,2008-07-15 22:16:00,29133,"Ok back to the question. Lots of us use braid,but will tie on either mono or some sort of floro combo as a lead.  Have you concidered using a very small swivel to tie line to line? Or(and this is not to be rude) are you not confident in your line to line knots?"
