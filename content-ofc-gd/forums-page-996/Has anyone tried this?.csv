228192,camillj,2008-07-16 00:10:00,1988,  Actually ... your argument is the EXACT reason why this beautifully simple and totally natural model is potentially viable ... the key (in not breaking any of the natural laws) is to remember that your Energy in line one must NOT be the same energy coming out from line two - or you accomplish nothing ... but if you accept there are LOTS of other natural forms of energy (like sunlight) which could be used to STORE potential energy which can later be released (as in line 2) - You have a fast and CLEAN way of creating almost limitless source of manageable power - especially (and this is for you Rich) ... if you notice that the H2O input is exactly the same as the H2O output - in other words you dont 'USE UP' ANY water at all ... how cool is that ... actually the real issue from a practical perspective ... is that the water coming out of the system is so much purer than the water going in .... you keep having to deal with residue on your electrodes
228233,Daplumma,2008-07-16 01:44:00,1961,Having been in the Navy I will try to anwer this so you will understand it.Just because the military does it does not make it economically efficient in any way shape or form.We had multi fueler trucks that ran on anything from cooking oil to diesel fuel and more.Cost to set one up was more than you would ever recoup from running french fry oil in the states but if you were low on fuel in Diego Garcia it was worth the extra bux for that multi fuel option to be able to run on home brew corn squeezings to complete your mission.I am sure if they can run stuff with a water mix the payback is not yet economically feasible at this point.I also know they spend more money on a hammer or toilet seat than you or I would ever.The reason they would develop this technology for the Hummer(I dont really believe they are) would be more for versatility of the Hummer and not for economy.

228268,oncogene,2008-07-16 02:41:00,154,"Woh it's on tv/internet, it must be real!  Seriously, that video posted here.... please go watch it and listen carefully to what the guy said..... ""... water..... water AND ELECTRICITY..."". Hear the word ""ELECTRICITY""?? doh, everyone knows that will work, of course.... it's just electrolysis of water. That video proves nothing.  US military using it? For 1, it only said they'r developing, nothing solid is made public yet. For 2, just becoz military is trying it, doen't mean it will work 100% for sure... for every idea/research/breakthru that makes it big, there'r probably a hundred others that never go beyond the laboratory stage. And 3, u don't even know what/how exactly the militia is developing.... for all we know, they can simply be storing the excess energy from the engine (considering engine is only 20-30% efficient) and use that to electrolyze water. And 4, as Daplumma said... military is not about efficiency nor economical there.   And then what's with these statements of ""electrolysis requires less energy than the energy u get from burning hydrogen/oxygen""..... ""HHO gas is different, it's not really breaking the bonds blah blah"".... ""hydrogen has potential energy... so it's a fuel"". Where do ppl get these ideas from, seriously? People complain others are too stubborn to believe in these ""new tech"" yet claiming something that completely defy the very basic principle of physics while offering no proves whatsoever, other than it's on tv.   As for saying we can use solar/wind/geothermo/tidal/hydro/nuclear/bio-diesel/whatever-else to general hydrogen blah blah blah.... you guys are missing the point completely. Yes, sure we can do those. But in either case, hydrogen is NOT a NEW energy SOURCE as of now. All we do is using hydrogen as a energy STORING/TRANSPORTING medium, it's simply transforming the energy we already have to another form. We are already using solar/wind/etc energies... but they are simply not enough, not cost-effective, not reliable, high cost, high maintainance & have limited use depending on geographical locations/weather. If all these solar/wind energy sources are enough, we'll already be using it in our everyday homes/offices... but it's NOT! So you guys think we can use these limited solar/wind energy sources, that aren't even enough as is, to generate hydrogen for the millions of cars on the road? As a matter of fact, using any electrical source of whatever we already have to generate hydrogen is useless. Look at the power blackouts we got during the heat of summer.... we dont' even have enough electricity as is.    Say, I have 2 slices of bread left while I got stranded in the wild, enough for me to survive for couple of days. Now I found another lost person with no food. What should I do to make enough food for both of us?  1) I take 1 of the 2 slices of bread, toast it on fire.... wohla... now I have bread AND toast..... i have more food, yeah? OF COURSE NOT, the toast is from the same bread slices I have, it's just in different form!  2) Try to go find another/NEW food source.... like... go catch a fish. Now that fish is a new food source (assuming u don't stupidly use the bread as bait...)"
228284,John Bacon,2008-07-16 03:16:00,3277," If the bonds are not being broken wouldn't it still just be water?  When hydrogen burns it does so by combining with oxygen in an exothermic reaction.  If the hydrogen in HHO is already bonded to the oxygen molecules (""O-H Bonds ARE NOT being broken"", as quoted from your post); then what exactly happens when HHO burns?  Even if we accept that H2O somehow becomes HHO when electricity is applied to it; and we accept that HHO is somehow different then H20 even though they both consist of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom (remember, you said the bonds were not broken); why wouldn't the Law of Conservation of Energy apply to this reaction?"
227614,camillj,2008-07-14 21:06:00,1988,OK ... I cant take it any more .... as a guy who studied chemistry  and physics in university I can say the following with some confidence (from personal experience) :  YES you can get hydrogen gas from water - and electrolysis is a VERY easy way to do this  YES Hydrogen gas will burn to produce an EXOTHERMIC reaction - in other words it will power things (like engines) - its a little bit explosive ... so you have to manage the burn .... but it does work !  The 'missing link' is to get the hydrogen out of the water AND to store it in an economically viable way ... what hasnt been discussed in this thread is harnessing things like solar power (to produce the electricity) to convert water to hydrogen gas and Oxygen gas (both sunlight and water are readily available and practically free)... and to store this in a way that can be used to enhance ) or replace the fuels currently in use.  While I am not sure we have already got commercially available and safe hydrogen fuel cells YET ... it would be VERY niaive to think this won't be accomplished in our lifetime ... the rising cost of and limited availabiity of current fossil fuels are at the point where it now makes SENSE to do so ... just like we used to think it wasnt commercially viable to separate oil from the TAR SANDS .... it wasnt ... THEN .. but it DEFINITELY IS ... NOW ... and billions of dollars are being invested (and made) proving it works ...  My guess ... less than 10 years ... probably will become an huge safety/legislation issue as people try to store Hydrogen they make themselves from solar power - and transfer this from storage into useable containers (in fuel cells) .... but wow ... come on folks what an exciting issue to be a part of...brace yourself ....   and here's a little link talking about the subject in some easy to understand terms ... http://www.theodoregray.com/periodictable/...01.1/index.html  Or ... go fish
227669,BillM,2008-07-15 00:09:00,17367,"  Sorry bud, I atleast got 2 letters right!!!"
227767,jonnybass,2008-07-15 03:50:00,346," Thanks for that explanation camillj.  From what I've read, the idea that people are buying into involves burning the hydrogen as it's produced, thus no need to store it. A ""Hydrogen on demand"" type of system."
227855,Rich,2008-07-15 13:09:00,3927,How dumb is it to fuel things on water instead of fossil fuels. I'm guessing saltwater is a no-no.. so we're going to use up all our freshwater (which by the way is more expensive than gas) to get around?
227860,Artem,2008-07-15 13:30:00,11,"I am going to say that this is not true. I study science at university and this violates the first law of thermodynamics; which states energy can neither be created nor destroyed and in an isolated system the total energy is always the same.  Water is a molecule of H2O, Hydrogen H2 releases energy when it is reacted with oxygen to form water (H2O). So the problem here is that it is a circular reaction.  2 H2O + Energy --> 2 H2 + O2 which then reacts to 2 H2 + O2 --> 2 H2O + Energy. You neither gain nor lose energy through this reaction and that is even if it does occur so that pretty much is theoretical proof that this device is a scam.  If you want to increase you're fuel efficiency the best way to do it is to work with your car. For every unit of gas burned you produce 1 unit of energy say. You want to make this unit of energy count for as much as possible. Ways to do this are simply making adjustments to your driving habits. This is especially important for long distance trips like going up north.  1. Use the gas and break pedal as little as possible. Accelerating very quickly, like flooring it after a green light is very inefficient. You put the car into high RPM and while you gain speed faster you burn more energy getting there. So if you are at a red light be light on the gas pedal and get to cruising speed fairly slowly, you want all the gear changes to be done at as low as possible RPM. The break pedal is the other one; you want to use this as little as possible, every time you break you are losing potential coasting energy which is burnt fuel. This doesn't mean disconnect your break and just pray for the best it means avoid the style of driving where you gas up to 130 get near the car ahead of you break down to 100 then gas back up to 130.  2. Speed is a bit more tricky. Every car has it's own ideal speed depending on a ton of factors, where the gears are set, how much HP the engine has, the aerodynamics of the car. What you want is to be in the very lowest RPM of your top gear. For my 03' Accord this is around 90 km/h or give or take but I still drive 100 on the highways just to save some time. Pretty much you should not be going above the speed limit, yes you save time but you burn more fuel. One of the few cases where time is not money. Also connected with point 1. is that you want to keep a constant speed, if you are going 100 go 100, not jumping back and forth between 95 and 105. Cruise control is ideal in this situation.  3. Take care of your car. Keep up to date with your oil change, make sure your tires are fully inflated, have a mechanic check under the hood that everything is in good order.  So to sum up, take your time driving, go the speed limit and try to cruise control and if you don't have that keep a steady foot to keep a steady pace. Fishing is about enjoying yourself, enjoy the drive up and the scenery as well. Save green by enjoying the greens.  Cheers"
228099,jonnybass,2008-07-15 20:26:00,346, Freshwater is more expensive than gas? I can fill my gas tank with tap water for a few cents - Your water bill where you live must be thousands of dollars each month. Shower much?
228113,jonnybass,2008-07-15 20:38:00,346," Thanks for that write up Artem.  My question to you is: If this is such a basic violation of the law of conservation of energy, why is the U.S. Military having this developed for their Hummers?  That's why I dug this thread up - to ask the nay-sayers this question. It seems to me that the U.S. Military physicists probably know more than I do, so I was just wondering why they feel that this technology is feasible when OFC scientists know otherwise."
212446,jonnybass,2008-06-08 03:28:00,346," Well, that's the point... the normal everyday person should be using it.  As far as the mainstream goes - Maybe, and this is just speculation, but maybe the powers that be ie big oil companies have surpressed this kind of technology to protect their own interests, but now with the internet it's becoming impossible?"
212448,Burtess,2008-06-08 03:32:00,901,"  Dude, go get one, and please keep us updated on its performance; installation costs, fuel savings, horsepower increases, carbon monoxide decreases, etc. and how fast it gets you to the swamp land you bought down in Florida  Burt"
212449,jonnybass,2008-06-08 03:34:00,346, Who told you this? I think that you would get more energy from burning hydrogen than the amount of energy needed to produce the electrolysis reaction. In the video they stated that the flame from burning the HHO is as hot as the surface of the sun. Do you really think that you could generate that much heat from the amount of electrical current needed for electrolysis? I don't think so.
212450,jonnybass,2008-06-08 03:36:00,346, I would get one but they're not commercially available for cars yet.  What's up your bum anyway? lol
212452,Burtess,2008-06-08 03:43:00,901," I am sorry, this is way too brutal.....  You must understand the laws of conservation of energy, to drive the electrolysis reaction to produce hydrogen, you must add a greater amount of electrical energy than the amount of potential energy evolved in the hydrogen gas produced.  You cannot create more energy from something that does not already contain it.  The difference is lost in heat etc.  It is irrelevant that a hydrogen flame burns as hot as the suns surface.  I am going to hang myself now lol...  Burt"
212052,jonnybass,2008-06-06 23:16:00,346," Yes, it is HHO. From the video: ""Kein has just patented his process of converting H2O into HHO"" (through electrolysis)  That's the same thing the email was talking about. I'm trying to figure out why people say it doesn't work when it obviously does, unless I'm missing something.  I would try this on my own car but I have no knowledge of mechanics. I don't even do my own oil changes. lol.  I'm sure there are a lot of people on here that could get this working. Whoever that person is, I'd pay them to get it installed on my car. I'm sure a lot of OFNers would also."
212057,danbouck,2008-06-06 23:20:00,4380,  I'm trying to figure out how to do it without buying any kit. I'm going to start with a lawnmower and then buy a $50 car to try it on.
212064,jonnybass,2008-06-06 23:25:00,346," Are you being serious? If so, that would be awesome to see how you make out. You should post pictures as you go so we can see this unfold. I'm very curious about this."
212068,bigfish1965,2008-06-06 23:29:00,3382,"Except most of our electricity is water generated. So the efficiency is much, much higher. Imagine just using the water under your boat to power your boat??"
212073,danbouck,2008-06-06 23:37:00,4380," As I said in the HHO thread, Patent Pending"
212075,danbouck,2008-06-06 23:39:00,4380,  I'm serious! It's finding the time to do it that's the hard part.  If I do get anywhere with it I will post pics (I will gladly show the blown engine pics as well  )
212115,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 00:45:00,314,  This man has given the right info!  Not possible........  never has or never will be a solution.  Extracting hydrogen through electrolyisis is as old as dirt!   Anyone who actually thinks it all of a sudden is a solution is just getting sucked in the high gas price drama!  Good luck!!  I have lucky rocks for sale.........  2000$ a pop........   They will make u live to the age of 120 years.............  100% money back guarentee
212124,Canuck2fan,2008-06-07 00:51:00,1444," Yeah and in 1939 they couldn't split the atom..... things do change. I still think cold fusion ""worked"" in the lab though so what do I know? LOL"
212127,Zubris21,2008-06-07 00:55:00,563,"  Now, I'm not saying your wrong, because I really don't have a great deal of knowledge of this process.   I think the complete electrolysis of water is what made the old hydrogen fuel cells so inefficient and dangerous.  The new technology is only a partial electrolysis, where the water molecule is being re-arranged to HHO as opposed to 2 Hyrdogen ions and one Oxygen.  perhaps since the bonds aren't actually being broken, considerably less free energy is required...  again just a thought, would love to hear from a chemist or physicist if we have any around."
212128,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-07 00:56:00,314,Maybe you should jump in your time machine and let me know when they get it figured out
212130,Zubris21,2008-06-07 00:58:00,563," I agree I think these little ""cells"" are a waste of money.  I don't think modifying your current ride with these will gain much value.  I could however see new concept cars, or HHO hybrids showing up in the next couple years.  if the technology is legit."
