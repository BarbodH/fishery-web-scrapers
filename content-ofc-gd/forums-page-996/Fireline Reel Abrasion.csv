228223,Dabluz,2008-07-16 01:19:00,701," Actually, all the new lines are made of the same substance.  It's either called ""dyneema"" or ""spectra""....depending on who manufactures the stuff.  Sometimes the stuff is twisted and braided together to make ""braid"".  Other times it's forced together with a bit of heat and is called ""fusion"".  Fusion is a thinner than equivalent strength braid.  That's normal because the braiding process does make tiny gaps in the material thus making it a bit larger but less prone to fraying.  Braiding also does increase elasticity a tiny bit too.  There is one line that I use that uses both processes.....braided line with a core of parallel fibers.  The line is called Mason Tiger braid.  I like it a lot.  It's a tiny bit thinner, considered to be the strongest of the braided lines and the best abrasion resistance of the braided lines.  However, tying knots in the stuff is real tricky.  When the knot is cinched real tight, the outer braid sometimes gets cut and exposes the core.  Fireline, which is a fusion type line is by far the strongest line but it does fray easily.  I reversed the first batch of 8 lb test Fireline on one of my reels last year after about 8 or 10 years of use.  I have some Power Pro on one baitcaster but I found that Mason Tiger Braid is limper and casts a bit further.  There are 3 types of Tuff Line.  Tuff Line XP, Tuff Line Plus and Tuff Line.  The best one is Tuff Line because it does not have any additives like mono coating to make it a bit stiffer and smoother.  Most of the braided lines do have a very thin cover of mono.  Some are even covered with so much mono that they are very smooth.  However, the mono does make these lines a bit stiffer.  None of the new lines float.  If they do float it's due to the fact that these lines do not absorb water and their is a resistance at the surface of the water that pushes against all objects.  Mono floats because it's specific gravity is lighter than water.  But mono absorbs water...about 15 to 20% of it's weight in water and this decreases the floatability of the line.  If you want your braided line to float longer, I guess rubbing some silicone on the line every once in a while would be the best trick."
223915,JohnF,2008-07-06 20:27:00,3494," There's at least part of my answer. I'm using 14# Fireline. Probably more than I need for 1 1/2# bass, huh?  That's about all I use this rod for. Perhaps the odd hammerhandle that thinks it's a bass. But I wanted something to haul lures through the weeds. My 4# mono kinda limits where I can toss lures. I'll leave the fireline on for a while longer but will likely replace it with something lighter eventually.  Thanks for all the advice folks.  JF"
223928,jace,2008-07-06 20:52:00,472,"tape makes a mess IMO and it can still slip.   Using a mono or dacron backing is the standard even for lines over 100#.  gel spun lines do not hold certain common knots so you need to pick and choose the ones that do no slip.  For example, the clinch knot, probably the most common knot, slips and comes undone."
223932,Dabluz,2008-07-06 21:00:00,701," CT has a sale on Fireline this week.  I'm positive that you will be very satisfied with 8 lb Fireline.  It breaks at over 16 lbs yet is very quiet and supple.  The reason I say that it breaks at about 16 lbs is the fact that there was an independant test done on lines a couple of years ago using a bunch of 20 lb test mono, fusion and braided lines.  The 20 lb test Fireline breaking test averaged out at 47 lbs."
223954,JohnF,2008-07-06 22:20:00,3494," I'm a gearpig. I'll probably try some. My wife's very happy I gave up diving. Dive toys were very expensive. Fishing stuff is perfect (in her mind). If I tell her a $15 spool of line will keep me amused for a while she's all for it. Used to be $2500 drysuits, $1000 regs and $200 tanks. Fishing is good.  JF"
227898,Guest buick14,2008-07-15 14:47:00,0,"I had the same problem except it wasnt with fireline.  It would reel nice and smooth when there was no line going through it, and once the line was going through it, sounded like a cement mixer.  I was sooo stumped and tryed everything............  Turns out there were tiny grains of sand/dirt caught under where the eye runs over the wormshaft...........again it would reel fine without line going through it............So when I applied some small hand pressure to the eye on the wormshaft, it would grind like crazy!!!  The fix was running the wormshaft/eyelet portion under the tap while reeling (only took like 5 seconds) and it was back to normal     (then i greased it after)   maybe this was said already, I didnt read all the other posts, and maybe this wasnt the problem but I hope it helps  ps if you think the eye is getting worn out from braid/superlines you will wear a groove which will fray your line"
227915,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-15 15:26:00,2050,"Got 14lb fireline from my brother for christmas last year.  I've got it on my Abu 502 and it is very noisy compared to Super Braid.  I love the fact that it doesn't stretch, and that it has a smaller diameter than mono (like braid) but I find it to be way to stiff for my likings.  I'll most likely finish off the season with it but re-spool with 12 or 14lb Stren Super Braid in the spring...unfortunately John, my future wife frowns upon purchasing $20.00 spools of line when they aren't necessarily needed.  She know's the Fireline is still new!   Last week it was either re-stock my senko's and buy a new deep dying x-rap, or pick up a spool of line.....the baits won out.  Cheers, UF"
227929,JohnF,2008-07-15 15:44:00,3494, I've got 35# SuperBraid on my baitcaster and it's more pliable than the 14# Fireline. The Stren gets my vote too.  JF
227932,Rich,2008-07-15 15:45:00,3927,"I used Fireline when it first came out (there is a new formula now so I'm not sure if it's the same) and it completely wore through the roller after a season.  Keep in mind it was a cheapo reel (I was like 12 years old), Quantum Vector or something. I didn't like my experiences with Fireline though, some people swear by it. Maybe the new stuff is better. I'm too cheap to try it again. lol"
228015,Dabluz,2008-07-15 18:00:00,701,"Even mono can cut grooves into rod guides and reel guides.  I remember changing the reel guides on my Mitchell 300 every year because my 4 lb test mono would cut grooves into them.  The reel guides did not even turn....had no bearings on these reels.  The 4 lb test mono would also cut into the rod guides too.  This was real noticeable when you changed line size.  One time I put on 8 lb mono and the grooves cut by the 4 lb mono really sliced my 8 lb mono.  After that incident, is when I started to regularly inspect my line guides.  I haven't run across any line guides getting cut in many years except in one incident.  My wife's uncle insists on using very cheap reels.  He does a lot of bottom fishing in the Saguenay river.  Since he is always getting stuck on bottom, I told him to use one of the new braided lines.  A couple of days later he told me that the line was useless and broke easily.  Not long after, I noticed that he was using a very cheap reel.  One of those reels that you could buy about 20 years ago for 3.98.  The line guide had long ago disapeared and the line was rubbing against the bottom of the deep bend at the start of the guide where the reel guide used to fit.  There was a good sized groove in the metal that was fraying the braided line."
228093,spooner_jr,2008-07-15 20:10:00,193," I had trouble with the line slipping on the spool, and from then on I put silicone pipe thread tape on the spool before filling it.  Its cheap, doesn't make a mess and it works."
