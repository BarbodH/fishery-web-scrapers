227990,fishnsled,2008-07-15 17:21:00,3520,What a great way to spend a week!  Thanks for the report!
228130,Moosebunk,2008-07-15 21:26:00,3970," Well, I was trying to remember where Larder Lake and the big fish was... then I think I confused myself with some roadside fish in Martin River.  you mentioned the big fish is around North Bay... then your launch was about 15 minutes from the big fish.  I thought your cottage was up in bum-fudge nowhere Quebec... and it is... around that Rouyin Gouin Slouin Place north of New Lisk.  Just seemed to get the wires crossed.   Sutton next year?"
228132,NAC,2008-07-15 21:31:00,369,killer trip for sure!!  nice that you were able to get the whole family into it too.
228133,solopaddler,2008-07-15 21:39:00,8605," Sure, if you're talking the 7 day float down the river."
228142,Moosebunk,2008-07-15 22:01:00,3970," If I go Mike it'll be customized.  Would like 3 days around Hawley Lake to play with lakers and pike, then leave on a leisurely 9 day float down the river after receiving a thorough intinerary of camp and fishing spots from my Peawanuck friends.  Why stay only 7 when you're paying for the pick-up and drop-off all the same."
228150,solopaddler,2008-07-15 22:17:00,8605," Sounds amazing, I'm in. (just have to run it by Joanne first, weather her wrath, then get the divorce papers signed  )"
228186,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-15 23:42:00,2585,what a great report!  maybe my favorite so far this summer!  cheers!
227826,solopaddler,2008-07-15 12:02:00,8605," You know, it doesn't matter how old I get, how many times I've done it before, I still get stoked on the eve of a trip. The anticipation is killing me! It helps when you arrive home from work (6:30 this morning) and there's a package from Cabelas stuffed with cool looking new lures waiting for you  . Next week can't come fast enough bud!"
