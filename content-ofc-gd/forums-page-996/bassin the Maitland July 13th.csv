228103,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-15 20:28:00,2585,"nice fish!  i got to stop and through a few casts next time im that way, i keep hearing the smallies are awesome out there  cheers!"
228129,NAC,2008-07-15 21:18:00,369, It's a Pungo 120. Stick with SOT's or you'll wish after that you had...  just my opinion.  Wink(guy in pics) is going for a sit-on top now.  Biggest thing is to look at them all before you decide.
228131,NAC,2008-07-15 21:27:00,369," 21-1/2"" is impressive for sure!  We'll be fishing near the mouth soon and then I'll start measuring.  They get real big moving in/out lake to river and there's nice largies there too.  I never remember the OFC sign."
