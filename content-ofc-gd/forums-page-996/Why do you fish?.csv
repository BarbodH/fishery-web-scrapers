228306,ehg,2008-07-16 04:01:00,2666,"Became hooked on fishing when i was about 8 yrs. old when i caught a brook trout in Duffins Creek. After catching a few suckers on worms suddenly this amazing beautiful creature bit the worm; that brookie changed my life.  A couple of years later my family moved to Oshawa right across from the Oshawa Creek. Steelhead and salmon were starting to take off in the stream then and again i was hooked. At the same time my father bought a nice trailer and put it up at Pigeon Lake so now as a pre teen i was catching walleye and bass all summer, and trout/ salmon in fall and spring.  Gave up on the steelheading as it became to crowded, but still fish brookies and go to Pigeon 25 yrs. later.  When i fish it's all i'm focused on, it feels right and crushes the usual time-space continuum.  ehg"
228350,bpsbassman,2008-07-16 11:40:00,941,"A poem I found here on the board a few years ago:  I am a fisherman. It's not something I do, it is who I am. Fishing is not an escape. It is where I belong, where I am supposed to be. It is not a place, but a lifelong journey. It is a passage my father showed me, and that I will show others. When you understand this, you will know me, and we will fish together."

227891,JohnF,2008-07-15 14:35:00,3494," Yup. There's quite a rush when you feel a big one take the hook. I'm not sure if that's due to our competitive nature or some atavistic gene that responds to scoring on the hunt. Whatever, it's a grand feeling, isn't it?  JF"
227896,Anatz,2008-07-15 14:45:00,74,"It's ironic how I'm totally against hunting with guns,bows and etc. But yet I find nothing wrong with fishing. Well the only difference is, I don't kill what I catch, I release it back..I guess I'm still a hunter."

227913,1northerner,2008-07-15 15:25:00,17,"As much as I hate to admit it, everything in the first post comes into play at times.  Usually it's just something to do after a long day of work, good way to hang out with family or just plain old interesting people.  I like just rocking away in a boat, sitting quietly, watching the sparkles in the water...  oh.. sometimes it's necessary in order to eat.  We don't pack much food when we go out in the bush."
227917,ccmtcanada,2008-07-15 15:30:00,7971,"A fellow board member, Jen, posted something last year that has stuck in my mind ever since I first read it.  Here's an excerpt of a report from the past from her....  ""The sounds I never heard ( birds everywhere - ducks, geese, black birds, crows...the hum of wings as they fly overhead. Fish breaking the surface of still water or waves crashing against shore)  The sunrises and sunsets I have never noticed ( dew rising off of the grass in the early morning hours or coating it as dark quickly approaches)  The smell of the trees, forests, lakes... not to mention the smell of a goose still warm after you have dropped it from the sky. ( I had never even considered that a bird would smell like something)  No wonder one yearns to fish or hunt. It isn't about the catch or the kill, it isn't about putting food on the table or in the freezer, it isn't about the competition...what I have discovered atleast for me is- it is about finding peace in yourself, understanding the world around you, and appreciating what is in your own backyard.  It takes a great deal of effort to slow down in life long enough to actually see the beauty that is all around us.  Pictures can not describe adequately what one has felt and learned from an experience however they allow you to share a little of what was. (some may find them too graphic and may not want to continue reading this post) I wish I could find the words to explain what I feel inside. The closest I can come to the perfect words would be AMAZEMENT, AWE and RESPECT for what I didn't used to see and now am trying to understand.""  This came from her and her discovery of the outdoors.  I haven't seen a report from her in a while now...hope all is well with her and that she drops by to say hi again from time to time."

227952,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-15 16:09:00,2050,"I'm going to say all of the above - and unless somebody else already mentioned it - TIME WITH FAMILY.  I see no better way of spending quality time with my daughter, fiance and father.  My brother doesn't fish for whatever reason, I think it's because he's afraid of the sunrise! haha Growing up my Dad and I didn't always get along, but we loved time spent on the water together.  He taught me everything that he knew, and now I find myself teaching him many new things I've learned from fishing with Pro Angler's all over Canada and the USA.  I now live 6 hours away from him, and eagerly look forward to any time we're able to share the boat. (only I drive now) hehe  Good Thread! UF"
227959,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-15 16:19:00,2050,"Also - it's my job.  It's how I provide for my family.  I work for a fishing show, for a man that know's a HECK OF ALOT more about fishing than me, and lives to educate other people in a real big way.  Not to highjack the thread in any way, but people sometimes knock fishing show's for talking about what product's they're using, or plastering sponsor's logo's all over.  But at the end of the day it costs money to produce a TV show - ALOT more money than people might think.  So if it weren't for major companies sponsorships, Dave wouldn't have a means of teaching people what he's learnt over the years, and myself and a few others wouldn't have jobs.  I wouldn't be able to put food on the table, buy a house or get my 2 year old her first fishing rod..heh"
227968,NAC,2008-07-15 16:44:00,369,I quit fishing for 4/5 years after being hard-core for about 15 yrs.  I got back into it after buying my first kayak 6yrs ago and I find it takes away all my stress after about an hour of being on the water.
228050,doubleheader,2008-07-15 18:49:00,497,"Some years back I was taking up fly fishing and I read a quote by a famous fisherman that went something like this. "" I fish not because it is the most critical endeavor a man can do but because so many other things seem trivial by comparision"".  That about sums it up.  I enjoy just about everything about fishing.  My buddy and I have this ongoing debate about which is the best pursut, hunting or fishing.  I argue that fishing has all the elements of hunting with the intrique of not knowing what you might have hooked or will hook next, and, one needn't kill the animal (don't get me wrong I'm a hunter) in the pursuit of the sport. It's a fabulous past time."
227832,Canuck2fan,2008-07-15 12:20:00,1444,"I left fishing for a long time when they started up with the fishing tax er um licence fees because I didn't see that the money would benefit the resource and in my opinion it really hasn't gone far enough to protect and enhance our resource.  However, despite my problems with how the government was missing the boat on the importance of sport fishing. A bunch of the younger people from work were talking about fishing and they really just didn't have a clue. They had went fishing 5 times and caught one fish between the 4 of them. So I decided to share with them some of knowledge I had gotten from my father, grandfather and a couple of uncles who were some of the most consistent and prolific fishermen I have ever seen. I started out slowly easing back into it using equipment that was 20 yrs old getting laughed at for some pretty beat up stuff, that was until I was reeling in fish while they were standing there gawking. Then slowly they were too were catching fish after watching and finally accepting that if you see someone being successful while fishing don't reinvent the wheel, mimic as best you can what works for them.  Now, seeing someone use techniques that you and your family developed over 20 yrs ago still catch more fish than thing else on certain spots is extremely rewarding. Especially since my one uncle and grandfather are gone now. Sadly my other uncle has lung problems so bad he can't find the energy to go fishing anymore. Seeing those techniques passed on is a big reason I got back into fishing.  Taking my uncle who can no longer go and his wife a feed of fresh fish that is so appreciated is another big reason I like fishing.... Doing the same for my grandmother is even more rewarding.  I got lucky that first year back in the sport and met some more people who fish. They expanded my oppurtunities to fish for different species. I learnt how to steelhead from some top notch guys who never cease to amaze me with how much they are willing to give of their time to impart the tricks and tips that have worked for them, and now work for me.  The number of people who I have met in the last 4 yrs on the waters all over south western Ontario that I consider fishing buddies is another reason I keep going. Every stream, pier or beach has it's characters who make you laugh or make you mad but you still have the bond of being a fisherman with them. So you go sometimes just to see who of the old timers made it through another winter to be out there doing what we all enjoy so much. That is probably the last and best reason I fish the ""friendships""."
227840,JohnF,2008-07-15 12:36:00,3494," That's about as close to my answer as anyone so far. It's at best a nebulous thing to describe, at least for me.  I hadn't thought of the dad connection but there's definitely some of that for me. Fishing was one of the few times we shared a common interest when I was a kid. I still have great, if hazy, memories of a camp we went to somewhere around Minden/Dorset on a little lake. I'm sure dad called it Devil's Lake but I can't find it on any maps. When we were home Dad was always working trying to keep his farm equipment business afloat in a time when farmers were struggling to pay bills so our fishing trips are the best memories I have today, fifty years later.  Toys have always played an important part in my life. I love tinkering. I kind of chuckle when some here talk about the high cost of fishing gear. Try racing motorcycles or sleds. Try serious scuba diving. Take up golf with a passion. Fishing is a bargain when you figure out the fun/dollar ratio. And look at the almost endless variety of inexpensive toys we can play with. I realize that goes out the window when a boat drifts into the picture but there's a lot of fishing to be done without having your own boat. Hey! That's what friends are for.  Another one for me is just the sheer joy of being outside away from roads and buildings. I guess that's why I enjoy wading like I do. Sometimes it's just me and the creek with no manmade objects in sight except my fishing gear. Sometimes I even resent the bridges I have to go beneath for their intrusion. A car whistling over the bridge can shatter the illusion. There are moments when I'm happy to just stand still in the river and watch whatever fishies are swimming by. There are even times when , as silly as it may sound, I actually apologize to a fish for screwing up his day as I slide him back in the water. Snagging a fish, or having him really inhale a hook can really ruin my pleasure but it doesn't stop me from going back, so there must be something less obvious that attracts me to it. That's the part I'm trying to get a handle on here.  Other things enter into my answer - the challenge of outsmarting the fish, reading about & trying to master new fish species & fishing methodology, escape from life's pressures, and just having fun feeling like a kid again, if only for a few hours.  But there's still some undefined element in all this passion that fishing arouses in us. What is it?  JF"
227854,Rich,2008-07-15 13:03:00,3927,All of the above!
227862,bpsbassman,2008-07-15 13:32:00,941,"Interesting to see the Dad thing mentioned so often. My father passed away when I was two years old.  I grew up surrounded by all these pictures of him on fishing trips holding up fish.  When I was about 7, my brother who is 13 years older than me, started taking me fishing.  I think there is some sort of draw to fishing, that when I fish I can relate to my Dad.  Maybe that's one reason I love fishing with my boys and now my grandson and granddaughters.  My brother, his son, and my two boys will be returning to the town of Trent River for a family fall Musky trip.  Fishing the same waters as my father did over 60 years ago. Whether fishing with family, friends or by myself, fishing takes me to a very special place where I find peace and tranquility like nowhere else. I think that's enough self analysis for today"
227877,Anatz,2008-07-15 14:02:00,74,"I fish because I love being near waters. It  helps me relax and clear all the stress away.  Another few reason are, I think fishing is a survival skill and it takes a lot of skill and practice to catch that certain species of fish you are after. It takes skills to catch the easiest type of fish which would be the sunfish. Sometimes when  fishing around other fishermen, I notice there set up is totally wrong and there will be no way they would catch a fish.  In addition, another reason why I fish is to out fish other fishermen around me. Sometimes you like to showoff by reeling in fish with every cast, for me, it feels great knowing that I'm better than the people around me.  Also, I fish to educate others. It's nice sometimes to have a stranger come up to you and ask you questions about fishing. It's really important for people to understand the positive aspects of fishing and how it affects everyone and everything in life. Nothing can compare to sharing your experience and knowledge with a young child and seeing a happy smile on their face. Kids are the future and teaching them this wonderful sport and important knowledge of fishing will keep fishing alive for future generations."
227880,Roy,2008-07-15 14:22:00,13728,I was told a long time ago that whackin' golf balls off a casting deck just looks retarded. So I fish.
