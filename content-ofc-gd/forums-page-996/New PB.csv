After an hour of nothing, no bites, we decided to drift through some weed beds in hope the eyes would be there.  Second drift fish on....missed....dang...didnt feel huge but somthing nonetheless. Rebaited quickly and tossed it back in the same spot....wham....fish on...this time there was no mistake. However to my amazment it was the biggest perch i have ever seen  in person.  We dont get many up here and to see one this size is truly something special and different.      We ended up also catching 6 walleye and 2 pike from the same weedbed with no other perch being caught  However we did have fun and will go back to the lake again...dont know when...but i will be back.  Cheers!"
