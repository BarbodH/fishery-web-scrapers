We stay at Grandview, yes they do have canoes available but I can't get them till 8:00 am  and shortly after it usually starts to blow up and fishing from the canoe by myself in the wind is just not fun all suggestions would be appriciated.  Thanks,  FLEX ROD"

Whether you end up in a boat or canoe, the wind is never any fun....letting the sock out the back will give you a lot more control, and more time to enjoy the water you're fishing."
