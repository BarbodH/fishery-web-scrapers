One is my brand new ""White River Fly Shop"" chest waders are leaking in a boot right on the seem (as you can tell my test try was all wet ).  These were a gift so I do not have a bill.  The other is my XPS ""Performance Graphite PGX 70 MHT"" rod the tip snapped off.  This is also new this year; the bill is from Feb 26. So, what can be done? Thanks."
227632,HTHM,2008-07-14 22:20:00,4082,"Drive to the store and ask the people who are able to help you right then and there. I am sure they would be able to help you out with the waders, the rod tip.....if it was an oops, then you may have to eat it."
227725,bpsbassman,2008-07-15 02:27:00,941,If the waders are new you should be able to get an exchange although you should have a bill (explain that they were a gift).  Bring the bill with the rod.  If it was a defect there will be no issue getting a replacement.
227730,GBW,2008-07-15 02:32:00,8460,"TKS, it was the plan to go with all that I have to get it sorted out.  That's the problem, I have NO clue how it broke.  All I got was a ""did you know your one fishing rod is broken"" comment from my wife..."
227758,modny,2008-07-15 03:25:00,502,say it broke on a cast  or jigging while setting the hook
227866,Rustic-Fisher,2008-07-15 13:42:00,826,"Just tell the truth, Always get a kick out of hearing peoples crazy stories about how the rod broke.... You should have no problem replacing the products anyways  RF"
227975,jdmls,2008-07-15 17:04:00,575,"here's a thought.....wine and scream about how teribble those waders are and how they leak from out of the box....I know a handfull of guys who have bought them and returned them due to leaking, no questions asked...The last time I returned them it was out of the warranty period and I demanded an exchange for another brand, and BPS humbly gave it to me.....They know those waders are horrible , and won't give you any headache returning them.."
227980,GBW,2008-07-15 17:11:00,8460,Thanks all. now I just have to ask my wife what happend as I'm sure she knows and just isn't telling me...
