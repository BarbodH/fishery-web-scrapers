We did manage to get a fair amount of fish however I would of liked to have some bigger fish in the boat. Black Blade(Chris) is my friends dad and who i did 99% of my fishing with. As for lures we caught all of the bass on white tubes, with the exception of two.The off camera fish are as follows:  Chris-Largemouth Bass:1.7,1.10,1.6,1.2,1.0 Me-Smallmouth Bass:1.5 And the photos  1.15lbs   1.10lbs   2.4lbs (Biggest Smallmouth bass)   1.15lbs   2.6lbs (Biggest Largemouth Bass)   1.10lbs   1.8lbs   1.7lbs   1.3lbs   1.15lbs   And the last fish of the 2008 Bass lake trip is:   Here are some other photos of our trip-      Ok there is some more pictures. My only advice is to bring some tubes. As said white worked best however Chris had some hits on the darker tubes however did not land them. One morning he threw a white spinnerbait behind the boat and a 3+ SMB hit it but he could not set the hook. My hat goes off to Chris as he was always on the fish. I got skunked the first time out but right as we were about to go in for the night we pulled the boat up not to far from the launch and i kept on throwing my white tube and surely i caught my 1.15lb LMB and broke the boat jinx. There was never a dull moment in this trip and i will be sure to make some more reports as the summer goes on.  The final result for bass weight was- Chris:12.3lbs Mike: 13.8lbs All together is 25.11lbs!!!"
226784,Greencoachdog,2008-07-12 20:47:00,8163,Nice report and pics!
226785,Mattones,2008-07-12 20:52:00,587,Awesome catches!
226802,misfish,2008-07-12 21:21:00,29133,Bass Lake is awesome. I see now they have crappie. Maybe worth a trip. Great report and pics.
226881,Kerry,2008-07-13 00:35:00,383,"Good show!Buddies of mine were there opening weekend and didn't encounter any in the usual weeded areas.They ended up with two, 1 largie and 1 smallie both caught in 20 ft plus outside the park.As of this past week things are heating up and the fish are moving into the usual haunts.Early mornings are best over by the woods.The earlier the better.The bugs are awful at night.Still some shadfly activity too.  Kerry"
226893,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-13 00:52:00,2585,wow good report!  looks like you guys got into alot of fish  cheers!
226911,setomonkey,2008-07-13 01:45:00,872,"Sounds like fun. Is this the Bass Lake near Orillia? I've fished it a couple of times, did okay for bass (nothing big though) once I found the weedbeds on the north side.  Mike"
226918,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-13 01:57:00,0,Great report. I hear that 90% of the fish are in a very small section of the lake. You just have to find it! Thanks for sharing.
226959,little angler,2008-07-13 04:58:00,128,"Hey Mike hope you didn't forget about our little competition. Come on msn tonight and we will workout the rules post them and line the prizes up. Buddy some nice bass, going to have to do better though to beat me bud out fish by a 13 year old we will see soon enough! Great catches L.A"

227020,Black_Blade,2008-07-13 14:18:00,258,"It was a good time at Bass Lake PP, was a little disappointed that they no longer hold their Family Fishing Derby anymore tho.  For the last 15 years the PP has held a fun little derby on the first Saturday of the Family Fishing Week.  Over the years we have brought the kids to take part in it and it created some great memories.  Only in the last few years have we had a boat to get out on the water, which certainly helped, since fishing from the docks at the park is pretty tough.  My son won the 'youngest participant' prize in the second annual derby in 1994. (little guy on the end with rod and trophy)    As far as we could tell, the only place where we could get fish to bite was on the far side of the lake from the park and then only if we used white tube jigs...lol.  I tried almost every other item in my tackle box, just to see and even my trusty wacky worm failed to entice any bites.  The west end of the lake is quite shallow but when we got up there, we could find no cover or structure at all for the bass to hide in.  We had some luck over a few deep weed clumps heading back to the north shoreline where the water depth drops off quite sharply.  We swam our tube jigs over top of the submerged weeds along this north side.  We manged to catch 2 fish most times we went out, but it wasn't fast action by any means.  Nevertheless, it was a good time and from what we heard from others, we faired out alot better than most in our time there.  I talked to park staff and mentioned that if it were at all possible it would be in the park's interest to see about a stocking program for the lake or at the very least really encourage anglers in the park to catch and release.  The shaded area is where we had most of our action:    Bass Lake is a nice enough PP and is sure worth a visit.  It is a few minutes from stores for supplies.  Fishing is ok, but having a boat is a must.  You can rent a motor boat at the park but the cost is nutty...especially if you don't know where to go and waste valuable rental time searching around.  (Anyone who wants a copy of my contour map of the lake can send me a PM and I'll send you one)  BTW:  Congrats to Mike The Bass Fisher!  He finally broke the boat jinx he had last year....and finally caught some, fishing from a boat....lol."
227247,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-14 01:18:00,3761, Yes it is the Bass Lake near Orillia.
227292,Kerry,2008-07-14 02:18:00,383,"Black Blade, Don't be too critical on the numbers,Bass lake will surprise you.Being a small spring fed lake with a cooler start to the season it takes a bit for it to heat up.There are some real decent bass in there but catch and release is important for the big guys.Theres always been big sunfish and crappies are showing up more and more.  Kerry"
227327,Mike the Pike,2008-07-14 06:11:00,3421,WTG Mikey boy nice wack of fish and pics looks like you hae been out fishin the Little angler.  I have a blue seat like that I wonder if it will fit on my canoe seat.  MTP
227685,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-15 00:36:00,3761,"if i did my math right, the average weight is 1.3lbs."
227694,Joey,2008-07-15 00:54:00,9122,"Great job, nice report and pics.  We bass fished last weekend ourselves and caught nothing bigger than 1.5 lbs either.  But it was still fun  Joey"
227798,solopaddler,2008-07-15 11:21:00,8605,"Nice job Mike, tough fishing or not you guys caught a bunch of nice bass!"
227926,Rich,2008-07-15 15:41:00,3927,"With a name like bass lake, you gotta love it.  Nice report and you didn't do too bad. Big fish are a plus, but just catching fish on new water is always a challenge."
