Its not that I care, because I have had no troubles with them yet, they are smooth and impressively light (well, the premier is)  I find that the STX and Premier are very very very difficult to tune in, and only need a little flick to get it out there, but backlashes are common....... I am aware that these two reels have Infini-spool, and well its meant for lures with less weight....I currently have both premiers tuned into senkos, but when it comes to casting something a little heavier like a spinnerbait(which I use the SX for) it seems to not want to go as far as if it were a senko.....  ??  Is it out of the question to cast heavier baits with an infini-spool system then it is without like the s and sx versions? I would hate to have a restriction to only light baits.....  PS I have had many years of practice with baitcasters, but never with infini-spool.....  Interested in hearing other owner input on the reels  Regardless of everything said, I really do like the reels I own, and the premier with a cumara is a great combo!!  Have a good day!"

Daiwa, quantum, and shimano use the same design concept, and I would wager all the reel manufacturers have an equivalent at this point, especially in the low profile models.  The only thing i wouldn't do is use a burner ratio on heavier lures or lures hard pulling action unless you don't mind occasionally replacing the pinion and drive gears."
