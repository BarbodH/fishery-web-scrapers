And not much if any fishing will be done in that time as well.  mmmmm daydreaming of catching these guys on nipissing this morning!         Break time is over back to work now!!!!!!!!!  Cheers!
227456,johnnyb,2008-07-14 14:16:00,3413,"12 days!  That's 6 weekends of fishing....a summer's worth for many, I'm sure.  That would make it really hard to get back to work.  I love the markings on the bass in the first pic!"
227576,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-14 19:53:00,0,12 days in a row??That should hold you over for awhile!! Those are some nice Nipissing smallies!!

227621,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-14 21:45:00,2585,yes actually it was 13 of the last 15 but im done for while it looks like.  I dont think i will be fishing until the end of august unfortunatly.  Oh well it was a great couple weeks thats for sure.  Im planning a trip with a friend in september so hopefully that pulls through!  Cheers!

227809,ccmtcanada,2008-07-15 11:34:00,7971,I think many of us are envious that you got that many days to fish in such a short period of time!  I've thoroughly enjoyed your reports over that time period....thanks for taking the time to post them!  Great smallie by the way.
