228037,solopaddler,2008-07-15 18:29:00,8605,I was expecting Jackfish lake. Nice country out that way nonetheless  .
228039,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-15 18:33:00,3761,I don't know....Nova Scotia??
228042,Reef Runner,2008-07-15 18:37:00,980,Nice pics DouG.  Newfoundland!
228044,douG,2008-07-15 18:40:00,2693,"Mike, Jackfish photos will appear, honest.  That's a debt to you, my friend.  Anyone ID those three fish?"
228049,Roy,2008-07-15 18:48:00,13728,Nova Scotia withoot a doute eh?
228053,Moosebunk,2008-07-15 18:53:00,3970,"Singapore...  Tuktoyuktuk???   Ahhhh, PEI."
228059,danbo,2008-07-15 19:01:00,2646,I'm Bud the Spud from the bright red mud...PEI
228061,douG,2008-07-15 19:03:00,2693,"Of course, it's The Garden Province, PEI.  The red soil and cliffs at the shore is a dead giveaway.  The Gallant tombstones is another.  That cemetery is located at the family homestead that goes back to the early 1800s, at South Rustico.  Any guesses on the feesh id?  I'm currently at my sister's place, at Ketch Harbour, just outside Halifax."
228063,Reef Runner,2008-07-15 19:08:00,980,"Cod, Burbot and something under forceful regurgatation."
228065,solopaddler,2008-07-15 19:12:00,8605, Giant saltwater sculpin of course. Favourite prey of the huge brook trout that run the rivers out there....
228136,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-15 21:48:00,0,Great report. Always wanted to fish the east coast. Some freaky lookin fish you caught there.
228139,danc,2008-07-15 21:51:00,4677," I was gonna say ""There's Cod in Jackfish""?  Nice report Doug.."
228154,misfish,2008-07-15 22:23:00,29133,"Great pics my friend,but I got a question for ya,did ya kiss it I know ya dont need to be screeched in,as yer already a brudder.LOL"
228190,Sinker,2008-07-16 00:08:00,8692,"Well, you made it off the mainland, that's pretty good.....but ya didn't make it all the way!! LOL.  I see a codfish, a tomcod, and seacat. I don't know the real name for the seacat....that's what we always called them though. We'd fish off the wharf at night and just haul 'em in by de 'tousands!  Thanks for sharing!!  Sinker"
228194,Sandbag,2008-07-16 00:21:00,533,"I was going to guess North Rustico, PEI...beutiful spot.  Took a couple of charter boats out for Cod in that area.   Cheers  Craig"
228231,Daplumma,2008-07-16 01:31:00,1961,"Take me there please....I was there in 1976 for a minute,the water was cold but it was spectacular,still is to be sure.Bex and I are in for the next trip up there MR Gallant. Joe"
228256,douG,2008-07-16 02:12:00,2693,"Yes, the boats pictured are in North Rustico.  I believe the first two fish were cod, and the last ugly little facker they call a rock eel.  We caught sculpin as well, looking like a pot belly with a mouth, spines and tail."
