228110,Harv,2008-07-15 20:36:00,19,"I am going to be in the Bradford area camping next week and was hoping someone could give me some helpful hints on where to take the kids fishing.  I won't have access to a boat so shore fishing is the only option.  I am not familiar with the area at all so any advise on ""kid friendly"" spots for bass, perch, crappie etc would be greatly appreciated.  thanks  Harv"
