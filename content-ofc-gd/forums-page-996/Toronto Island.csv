Got into some bass, just tossin at the docks, and of course the sweetie takes the biggest.  Some pike follows with no takers. Even if it is only for an hour, it's still worth it! Here's a quick pic.

228046,Joey,2008-07-15 18:42:00,9122," She'll come around.  I remember when I was afraid to touch the leeches, now I can do it.  Very nice Largie.  Joey"
228123,Beans,2008-07-15 21:05:00,3339,"Leeches are the easiest to put on a hook Joey...unlike worms and minnows that squirm or flip around, leeches just grab hold of your hand while you put the hook in them...take hardly any blood at all...   sorry...off topic..."
