228200,Fisherman,2008-07-16 00:31:00,7201,"Last I saw on the A channel news was the MNR fellow explaining it is similar to ""herpes"" virus, and believed to have been introduced to the water by way of domestic aquarium dumping."
228214,danbo,2008-07-16 00:55:00,2646,See what happens when anglers kiss fish on the lips!
228219,jonnybass,2008-07-16 01:10:00,346,"I read that this was a problem in NY State also. I'll try to find the link for you. So, I doubt that it's the MNR that's responsible unless both the MNR and the NY State MNR (whatever they're called down there) are both in on it.  On a side note, I met a guy 2 years ago at a poker game who claimed to have an inside source who told him that it was in fact the government that caused this."
228275,holdfast,2008-07-16 02:55:00,1813,I tried to avoid this thread as not make more enemies than what I already have because my point would be So what who cares.  But I got to say though Raf that was hilarious.
227555,misfish,2008-07-14 19:25:00,29133,"I fished an inland lake yesturday,and there were carp floating everywhere. This thought came to me. Could a virus have been air bourne? Im starting to believe one guy that said the goverment had something to do with this,is right. Maybe they did fly byes and dropped some kind of kill pellit or something. The fact that the carp are dyeing everywhere,doesnot make real sence. Why are there no other fish floating around?  Ok Aliens ubducted me,I am not myself."
227556,Raf,2008-07-14 19:28:00,3495,i'm just waiting for a recall on 'green giant' and other corn products.
227558,PHISHY!,2008-07-14 19:31:00,24,"I was fishing Couchaching this weekend and was amazed at all of the dead carp that I saw!!!  There must have been at least 8 or 10 just in one small bay we were fishing in.  All sorts of sizes too.  We caught a few smallies in the same area and man, could they fight!  They were in no means in any bad health.  Not sure what's causing all the carp deaths but it's sure one hell of a mystery!!!  Weird.  Probably is aliens."
227561,timmeh,2008-07-14 19:36:00,609,"Seems very unlikely the government would have anything to do with this. Introducing a virus or poison or whatever into lakes and rivers is way too risking to remove carp. Too many things could go wrong, other species start to die, and such. It's a nice conspiracy theory but nothing else.  Not all fish are affected by the same toxins and pathogens as others, many are simply just carriers. For example west nile virus can kills blue jays and crows but most other birds are not effected. The same thing is occuring here as whatever is killing carp is not apparently hurting other fish. It may have something to due with their diet.  Also keep in mind they are not native to Ontario and so are certainly more susceptible to local viruses and such that native fish have developed immunity to."
227564,Headhunter,2008-07-14 19:37:00,5703,"""i'm just waiting for a recall on 'green giant' and other corn products."" Now that struck me as being extremely funny! Thanks Raf!  Sorry Brian, no idea what's killin the carp, just couldn't stop laughing! HH"
227568,misfish,2008-07-14 19:43:00,29133," So can it maybe be a floro thing that grows on the banks maybe even a bug/fly? Im just asking. I just dont understand why the wide spread. It is making me really wonder why this is happening. I could understand the theory of the lakes connected and spreading,but to hit inlands,that has to make one think.  Thank you for your response Tim  Raf,ty 2.LOL"
227569,Reef Runner,2008-07-14 19:46:00,980,It could be possible.  The government admits that they introduced a chemical to kill/contain the sea lamprey in our Great lakes waters sometime ago.  Gearing up for an asian carp invasion?
227570,bigreddog,2008-07-14 19:47:00,84,It doesn't have to be airborne -- it could be as simple as anglers not properly flushing their livewells and transferring contaminated water between bodies of water.
227571,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-14 19:48:00,2050,haven't seen any floaters out my way Misfish - I also doubt the MNR would do this without telling people about it.  Even if they wanted to they couldn't afford to pay for such a campaign! lol
227577,misfish,2008-07-14 19:53:00,29133,I was wondering about the chemical they introduce to kill the gobys in Simcoe?

227592,Photoz,2008-07-14 20:17:00,792,The stuff they used at Pefferlaw killed EVERYTHING!!
227595,Raf,2008-07-14 20:21:00,3495,it could be the boilies too.. i mean what kind of bread sticks together underwater.  it's just not right.
227598,misfish,2008-07-14 20:25:00,29133, Yes I now remember. Perch/rockbass.
227607,danbo,2008-07-14 20:47:00,2646,Zeitgeist for Carp? I doubt it..
227610,Fang,2008-07-14 20:51:00,1330,Elvis is to blame  I hear he'll be in Collingwood soon. Ask him then!
227613,misfish,2008-07-14 20:59:00,29133,"I will,were heading up,or is that over from here. THE KING LIVES. "
227620,timmeh,2008-07-14 21:45:00,609,"The koi virus idea is certainly a good possibility. My personal opinion would not be that someone intentionally tried to kill carp but if anyone released any pet fish into a local river that had the virus it could spread easily. So if anyone had a koi pond they wanted they wanted to get rid of and had nothing else to do with the fish, there you go. I don't know much about the virus but certain water conditions likely make it more dangerous to fish. It could slow down in cold water in winter and re-emerge when the water warms.  As far as the spread to inland lakes I would agree with it being transported around by anglers, boats, etc. The same way zebra mussels spread. What interests me is why some lakes seem more susceptible than others. I was up at sparrow lake last week and there were very few dead fish despite the fact it's connected and very close to simcoe and couch. It must have something to do with water temperature or something like that."
227626,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-14 22:00:00,2585, LOL by far the funniest quote i have heard in a while!  Thanks!  Weird that it just targets carp?  Cheers!
227628,Photoz,2008-07-14 22:11:00,792,A little better explanation on CTV . . . .  http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/stor...me=&no_ads=

Thanks again Raf! HH"
227846,theRJ,2008-07-15 12:48:00,55,"If anyone here wasted their money and went to see The Happening you have your answer. And not the unexplainable nature part, its the seaweed fighting back!"
227851,Rich,2008-07-15 12:59:00,3927,"Haven't noticed any carp down my way yet BUT there are a ton of small dead bullhead catfish all over the bay. At first I thought it was the normal few we see every summer as temps rise fast.. but this is a LOT. Even Johnny Bass noticed it (which is really what made me start noticing it). Could it be the same thing, different strain?"
227864,spyder3g,2008-07-15 13:37:00,50,There is no theory. The government poisons them on regular bases for some reason.
