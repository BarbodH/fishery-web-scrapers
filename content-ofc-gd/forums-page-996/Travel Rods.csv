228095,EC1,2008-07-15 20:14:00,930,"Im actually just in the market right now for a rod that is either telescopic or multi-pieced. Im hoping that i can put it in something as small as a backpack.  Does anyone know the differences between a telescopic and a multi-piece? What are the pro's and con's of each? Does anyone also have a recommendation?   Also, Is there a special type of reel that i will be needing to make it a good combo? Im looking to put a spinnning reel onto this rod.  Thanks in Advance for any hints and tips~~"
228102,Harv,2008-07-15 20:27:00,19,"I have built a couple multi piece rods for friends and they seem to perform well.  The specific blank is a Rainshadow SB 720 and it is a 6'  4 piece spinning rod rated for 4 - 8 lb test.  I would have to measure to be exact but I believe each section is around 20"" long.  I can tell you that Batson (Rainshadow )also has a great warranty.  My buddy broke the tip section of his while in Algonquin this spring and they replaced the top section of the blank no questions asked.  I don't know much about telescopic rods aside from the two I keep in the trailer for the kids to use when camping.  They pack up real nice but are not of the quality that I would fish regularly with.  Harv"
228104,johnnyb,2008-07-15 20:29:00,3413,I don't know that I've ever seen a good telescopic...the multipieces would be my choice.  I THINK I saw a nice kit by Okuma on AllAmericanOutdoors....and I know BPS is selling the latest Shimano travel kit which is supposed to be good.  Just my $0.02
228105,sharper,2008-07-15 20:29:00,279,Check out shimano S.T.C I'm looking to grab one as well. It comes in a telescopic model and multi piece with a really nice tube to carry it it.
228108,modny,2008-07-15 20:32:00,502,"my dad has a diawa mini spin from probably 40 years ago. it stilll works great for him. he took it to california for golden trout hiking on the john muir trail/  i had a quantum travel set, the tip broke bbut the rest was awesome.  okuma is supposed to have a good one aswell..  i would also go multipiece. not telescopic"
228155,TJQ,2008-07-15 22:28:00,7806,I just bought a browning 4 piece with a shimano sahara from http://www.all-americanoutdoors.com  This is the first weekend Ive used it and I am thrilled with it.  http://all-americanoutdoors.com/inc/sdetail/3771
228198,EC1,2008-07-16 00:30:00,930,"thanks for all the tips everyone, will sure look into each product that you guys mentioned !  and another question, do you guys take off the reel each time after taking everything apart?"
228320,jace,2008-07-16 08:19:00,472,"If you're willing to import one yourself, there are some top quality telescopic rods/blanks in the far east.   I've only seen a few in person myself, there's just no ddemand for them in north america.   If you want a cool little pack rod, check out the emmrod.  I saw an RV tourist fishing with one for the first time 2 years ago.  strange looking thing but it did okay on the salmon."
228373,holdfast,2008-07-16 12:56:00,1813,I thought I seen an Ugly Stick multi Rod at one of the stores in Saskatoon.  That would be my choice.  But Ive had a Mitchell for years and still have a Daiwa Apollo that I never used as a backup.
