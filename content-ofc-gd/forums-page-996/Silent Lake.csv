228075,bbog,2008-07-15 19:31:00,665,"As stated Laker fishing is pretty tough, if you want a chance you'll need to get your line down to them. No motors allowed (electric or gas) on this lake adds a little to the challenge.  The park superintendent is quite helpful in telling you where the Lakers ""should"" be. Smallies are available in many places but not in any quantity. Let us know how you make out."
