798379,fisher,2013-07-16 12:35:00,451,I am heading to a cottage rental on Kempenfelt Bay first week of August and wondering if anyone would share some knowledge on what species are around and how to target them.  I am particularly interested in whitefish and lake trout.  I have down riggers and dipseys as I usually fish salmon on lake O.  Also have bad boys and William spoons as I fish them in winter off IBP.  Never fished simcoe in the summer months and would be grateful of I got some sort of starting point and suggestions.  Thanks.

Whities are out in the same area as well, but really hard to catch this time of year.  If you have a calm day, you can can try jigging for them."
