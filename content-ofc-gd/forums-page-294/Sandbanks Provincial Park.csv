I will be only fishing close shoreline as I'm in a canoe and early morning and calm nights, just wondering if you guys have any fishing advice and what's in there anyway! Thanks guys"
793403,porkpie,2013-06-19 01:33:00,2521,"West lake, just down the way."
793410,Moosebunk,2013-06-19 01:44:00,3970,When I was a kid I watched a kid hook another kid in the wrist after casting under the bridge.  Seemed that was the place to fish.... but just watch out for kids fishing. lol.
793505,SylvanOwner,2013-06-19 16:34:00,266,"Yep, West Lake can be good for walleye, presumably bass, there are also pike and crappie.  East Lake same.  Good luck."
793508,Mike Pike,2013-06-19 16:43:00,1332,"Ok, now I haven't camped there in years( but LOVED it when I did ).  I remember fishing in May and getting pike and walleye in the river right in the park.  I beleive there's was bass and carp in there as well.  Good luck.  A great park with one of the best beaches around."
793580,Rizzo,2013-06-19 22:12:00,4754,"used to go there every year when I was a kid. Pike ,bass, pickerel in both east lake and west lake. Which lake do you plan to target?"
798405,preroller,2013-07-16 15:15:00,18,Any info on the trip yet?
798412,Broker,2013-07-16 15:54:00,482,"Got into some bass on the outlet river and just into east lake, nothing huge but some decent 2 pounders. Other then that didn't get out as much as I wanted as the whole family came down with big sinus colds and the beach was shut down due to E.coli, to sum it up the trip stunk"
