798199,SirWhite,2013-07-15 04:19:00,210,"I'm experiencing some issues with my Floro knots, well mostly the Palomar to hook knot. Is this not the ideal knot for Floro to hook? Almost lost a nice Smallie was as if the knot just let go under pressure."
798206,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-15 05:00:00,8243,Go to UTube there are many many methods to tie. If there is a knot of any kind Utube has many clips showing how to.
798210,jace,2013-07-15 07:35:00,472,commonly used knot for fluoro and i use it myself most of the time.  The only place i don't use it is on hooks too small to pass a doubled length of line through.  You must be tying it wrong.  I can't remember of any time i've seen one slip even a little bit.  It works on braids too.
798213,sauce,2013-07-15 08:53:00,219,I don't like Palomar with fluoro. Knots break. Clinch knot with less wraps than you would with mono seems to hold up better. I normally use 6-10 lb of various brands. This is just my personal experience.
798215,Dan668,2013-07-15 09:38:00,1120,Only use a San Diego jam knot
798235,adempsey,2013-07-15 13:43:00,1498,"I primarily use Palomar, but have been experimenting with the San Diego Jam knot as well.  I use 6 to 10lb test fluorocarbon though.    Things might be different at higher lb test."
798237,jedimaster,2013-07-15 13:45:00,3472,I use a improved clinch knot. The key is to visually check it to make sure its perfectly clean with nothing overlapping.
798242,ckrb2007,2013-07-15 14:42:00,449,"I use the palomar for smaller diameter lines and braids, and the improved clinch for larger diameter flouro."
798247,adolson,2013-07-15 15:03:00,783,"Palomar is practically the only knot I use, for all line types.  If I find a knot slips on a particlar line, I will do a double palomar instead."
798250,wallyboss,2013-07-15 15:37:00,1095,"Make sure that you wet the knot properly before tightening, fluoro easily heats up when tightened so it becomes the weak spot on the line."
798251,JoshS,2013-07-15 15:42:00,729,"I've always used improved clinch with fluoro, never had an issue. Just lube and clinch nicely."
798254,bare foot wader,2013-07-15 15:50:00,1354,"what brand of fluoro? if by any chance it's vanish, that's your problem right there...not a fan myself  or if your reel has baked in the sun in a hot truck? do that a few times and you'll see your line snap all the time"
798259,BucktownAngler,2013-07-15 16:26:00,582,use seaguar leader material
798268,TrippyJai,2013-07-15 17:18:00,28," Easy to tie, very strong and you don't have to worry about breaking off at the knot."
798348,i2cool2fool,2013-07-16 02:03:00,349,"My brother-in-law showed my a funky version of a Palomar he has been using for years and never really had much of an issue. Instead of passing the hook/tackle through the loop, he passes the tag end instead. He's probably been tying that way for 30 years."
798351,SirWhite,2013-07-16 02:23:00,210,Lol all of the above!  Also had it pass through an Albright knot as well. I won't buy this brand anymore
