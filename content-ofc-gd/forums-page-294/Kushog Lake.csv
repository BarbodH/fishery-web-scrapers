798338,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-16 01:11:00,4399,Going to be heading up to Kushog for a few days and was wondering if there is much in the way of hazardous rock/shoal structures that the Stratos has to worry about?  Thanks
798374,chris.brock,2013-07-16 12:12:00,4053,"I don't know the lake that well, I spent a day in the boat on it last summer, I think you will be fine  it's shallow/ rocky if you're trying to boat through to St Nora, but that's obvious"
798410,Rich,2013-07-16 15:37:00,3927,"The east end is shallower, west end is super deep. There are buoys marking most hazards. Keep an eye for boulders when cruising the shallows of the east end and closer to the islands."

798442,Rich,2013-07-16 19:17:00,3927,"Quite honestly: time to fish is never the problem. I ignore every other aspect of life to do it, pretty damn near every day. And I mean any and all ""normal"" parts of life, lol... Not for me."

798499,Dozer,2013-07-17 00:30:00,896,"Not sure where you are headed but I've been around the top section of the lake around Goat Island.  As long as you stay away from the shore you will be fine.  Good fishing to be had, enjoy   Check out MNR's Fish Online tool, they should have a general contour map of the lake."
798535,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-17 02:56:00,8243, Heading to Peacock for jumbos in AM will report when home safely.
798550,Rich,2013-07-17 09:29:00,3927,"Wow just realized you wrote time to work, not time to fish lmao"
798615,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-17 22:04:00,4399,"I can see Goat Island from the deck lots of nice structure...fishing has been tough only 1 decent smallie boated. We have tried everything with litte success, doesn't help that my fishfinder won't turn on for some reason!!! Trying again this evening."
798654,fishindevil,2013-07-18 01:11:00,6254,I fished kushog last week for smallies myself and got about 10 smallies all about 1.5-2lbs not big at all and only made it from the southern end up to hwy 35 at the firehouse grill there was a fair amount of boat traffic too and I did lose one decent fish right at the marina but I did see a few smallies cruising the shoreline but they were spooky but the smaller ones were not !!!! So it was not very good for myself either !!!! Gonna try it in a month or so again when the lake is not as busy and the fish a little less spooky !!! Ya and there was people out tubing and water skiing at 7:30am !!!!!!!! And it's a narrow lake so I think it spooked the bass and they made about 15 passes in their wakeboard boat making 3ft waves !! Grrrrrrrrr
