I'm employed healthy and driven and get down to the river as much as I can I'm selling  my boat and downsizing and taking a bit more of a keen interest in 2 wheels I know I know its a phase.  On the weekend I decided to push?excercise my limits and went in what is called a Spartan Beast 22+km and 25 obstacles on foot I got through, discovered I wasn't a jogger but one heck of a power walker(forced march) took me about 5.5 hrs in the Harwood bush. I felt great I feel great it was tough and the last couple of km I was almost in tears my knees hurt so bad. I have decided to pursue this in a smart way going forward to stay in shape, Couple of pictures attached zoom in and check out my left knee in the before(orange) picture I think this is why they call this the beast or I had a hitchhiker  Cheers and Tightlines Peter  "
