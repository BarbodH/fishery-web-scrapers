Saw a 1200lb at Princess Auto with the steel cable for $30. Those who use winches with steel cables, do you prefer it over the strap? Does the steel cable rust? I am open to suggestions for good quality winches."
798373,Roy,2013-07-16 12:10:00,13728,I use a strap without issues. My bunks are always in the water while winching so there's minimal weight. How much does your rig weigh?
798377,lew,2013-07-16 12:26:00,12766,"I've got a heavy glass boat and have never had an issue with the strap. As for the quality of a new winch, I'd never cheap out on something that important and would suggest you buy the best you can afford.  But that's just me."
798378,Fish4Eyes,2013-07-16 12:32:00,1022, About 1000lb.
798382,Roy,2013-07-16 12:56:00,13728,"The thing to consider is that cable has a tendency to bury itself on the spool. Also, once you've gotten a few pieces of galvanized cable in you hands, you'll probably go back the strap. But that's just my opinion."
798384,Ainsley,2013-07-16 13:13:00,142,I prefer a strap by far. I swapped out the cable on my 71 searay for a strap
798385,DropShot'r,2013-07-16 13:14:00,62, I agree here. I had a friend that used cable on his winch and it was such a pain.  Get the strap.
