797931,nroadrunner,2013-07-13 17:20:00,113,Went to the Dorset kids Derby as we do every year.  Great event all kids get a prize $2 to enter and they provide the worms.  Great prizes also including Shimano combos.  Takes place on the dock By the Bridge in front of northern delights.  Usually catch rock bass and little smallmouth.  3rd cast today my son catches this beauty.   Biggest fish of the Derby.  Very long and skinny I put it around 2 1/2 lbs.  Figure it would be pushing well over 3 if it wasn't so skinny. Thanks for the read Ian
