Do yourself a favor and crank your tire down and make sure the cable is ok and lubricate it and crank it back up.  Almost every minivan, SUV and Truck will have a tire that comes out from the bottom with a thin steel cable. Pass this on.And yes, I call the opp to report the tire on the highway.  This is the end of my public service announcement."

798243,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-15 14:48:00,10439,Probably a Chevy wasn't it? They seem to have issues with their spare tire support cables.
798245,lew,2013-07-15 14:50:00,12766," I do it twice a year, every year.  Sure wouldn't want to be stranded on the side of a hiway with a flat and couldn't get the spare down due to laziness."
798248,jedimaster,2013-07-15 15:20:00,3472,Yah it was a blazer or a jimmy. can't recall the specific model. Dodge caravans had that issue as well.
798256,Walleye72,2013-07-15 15:53:00,156,"Wow, scary stuff for sure!  A few years ago my family and I were driving home from vacation on Highway 11 Southbound and an SUV about 50 yds ahead of us had their rear mounted bike rack come apart and all 4 bikes spilled onto the highway at 110 km/hr. I was able to dodge the missiles and get through it. Scared the life right out of me. I don't think anyone was involved in a collision from what I could see. White Knuckle Driving!!!!"
798265,Roy,2013-07-15 17:02:00,13728,The spare on my Jimmy is all snug in its zippered jammies and like new inside the vehicle .
798283,misfish,2013-07-15 19:41:00,29133,"Ya when I got my F150. I dropped the spare,cut the cable and strapped it in the box. Who ever thought this idea of storing a spare under a truck"
