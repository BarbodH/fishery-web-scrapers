797848,adolson,2013-07-12 22:44:00,783,"I've been a fan of women's MMA ever since the first fight I watched (Erika Montoya first-round win by flying armbar). As such, I have watched some Invicta, yes. But I really haven't been too much in the loop with MMA ever since Zuffa started shutting down / taking over all the [better] competition.  I really miss the likes of PrideFC, Strikeforce, Affliction, etc., and - most of all - IFL (especially before they ditched the team aspect).  And now that Dana White has changed his mind about gender equality and added a women's division to the UFC, it's just a matter of time before Invicta is absorbed. Hope I'm wrong on that..."
798072,TJQ,2013-07-14 15:15:00,7806,Well we watched it.. and i can say.... i was NOT dissapointed...  most of the fights were absolute 3 round BRAWLS!!!  It was crazy and if ya like the UFC  youll love these women.  I was expecting alot of submissions... but pretty much everything was standup..
