797912,Mack66,2013-07-13 14:08:00,19,"I have an issue with one of my shimano reels and the other I would just like to have serviced/cleaned,  does anyone know if I can just drop them off at their building in Peterborough or do I have to mail them. This is what I am talking about http://www.shimano.com/publish/content/global_fish/en/us/index/customer_service0/Repair_Services.html Thanks everybody, Mack"

798008,Mack66,2013-07-14 02:10:00,19,?  Not sure what you mean?  I bought the citica I need repaired/looked at at gangons in oshawa but it was early in the year and I think I will have better luck at shimano. Plus I would like to get my caenen cleaned and oiled plus whatever else it needs.
798015,Fisherpete,2013-07-14 02:55:00,1814,You can take it right there - and they do good work. I have all my musky reels serviced there - they have the parts if any are needed...  Pete
