I decided to give this bass fishing thingy a try... Just to add some extra bites to my day...  Now I know a lot of spots that hold smallies but I didn't really know how to catch them other then a few accidental catches while trolling walleye...  So I messages a buddy asking for help... Kinda a trade of.. I needed him to help me with technique... And in return I'd show him some spots the pros don't know with big fish on them...  So we made plans for a day trip... And I was surprised at the numbers and quality of fish caught... Especially because I had never done it before... And we were screwing around running all over the river...  We did an 8am-4pm day... We boated 35+ smallies and 4 largies... Our biggest 5 fish were all over 4lbs which would have been a 20-22lb limit in a tourney...  And my buddy told me it was a slow day... Lol...  He was surprised at the size of fish on some of the spots I showed him... 1 spot put out 3 smallies over 4lbs...  I've been mostly leaning on the dropshot with xzone slammers either a smoke/minnow color or a green/brown gobie color... VMC spinshot hooks and a 16-18"" drop line with a 3/8 or 1/2 oz weight... Also hitting the flats with spinnerbaits... And a bit of tube dragging...  Anyways... Here a few fish from the past few weeks...            "
798426,Bassassins,2013-07-16 17:23:00,111,Tanks boys WOW!  Good on you to pick it up so fast.  Look forward to many more of these reports
798429,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-07-16 17:32:00,535,"Nice catches! Got to love the fight those smallmouth put up. What's slow walleye fishing for you, 8, 9 hundred a year? lol"
798436,Rod Caster,2013-07-16 18:06:00,5784,"haha I was kinda thinking that too.  Good stuff Mike, now you have bass-fishing as an option too!!"
798441,Jigs,2013-07-16 19:12:00,136,Nice fish. I'm glad you find the walleye fishing slow too. I was starting to wonder if I was losing my touch lol.
798478,solopaddler,2013-07-16 23:18:00,8605,"Well done Mike, it's always good to diversify."
798485,dhickey,2013-07-16 23:46:00,1038,Now all you have to do is figure out when to fish for what. Don't forget the top water lures
798488,aplumma,2013-07-16 23:50:00,6896,Very nice day of fishing Mike. You can add a few rattle traps with chrome/blue to fish with. I also use tubes with a yoyo retrieve in the deeper water fishing applications for smallies.   Art

798541,mike rousseau,2013-07-17 05:58:00,4661,Thanks everyone...  It was fun trying a new technique for a species I don't normally target...  And wouldn't you know it... Walleye like the dropshot too... Lol....
