798261,Steve,2013-07-15 16:35:00,2075,"Had a NRX 803S spinning rod break on me a few weeks ago.  As it has the NRX Wildcard program, I called my local shop, but they didn't have it in stock. They could have ordered it, but suggested I call around, as you can replace the rod at any authorized dealer (who has the rod in stock).  Called Kitchener's Natural Sports.  First I asked if the rod was in stock, before mentioning any warranty issue. They had it.  I then mentioned the Wild Card and if I need to bring with me anything further than the Wild Card and the rod. At first they were hesitant - I don't think they have had a wild card exchange yet.  They did mention to send it to Shimano, but I corrected them, and advised them of how the program works.  Immediately they agreed, told me to come in. Once there I was treated great. They had the new rod waiting. Simply took my broken one, my wild card, and asked for my information.  They were very friendly, which helped my decision to drop some dollars on some senko's.  That's what they want right? Help out a customer that in turns spends some dough in their shop.  Friendly, helpful, and seemed rather busy at the time.  Great service from a shop that I don't visit all too often (so no, I wasn't a regular, just good service provided)."
