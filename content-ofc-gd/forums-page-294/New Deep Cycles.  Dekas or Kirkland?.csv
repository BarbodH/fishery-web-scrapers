798286,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-15 20:13:00,8243,"Any reason why Roy?. I have had a Nautilus smart charger for 4 years and use it all winter, never had a problem. Maybe I'm lucky. Never had a CTC battery. I was told Nautilus are Johnson Control. Deka is my choice of battery, 8 years on my cranking battery before I replaced this year with another Deka."
798287,misfish,2013-07-15 20:17:00,29133,   Thats all I have ever used. Never an issue. Even used their bottom end lube and injector oil.
798291,moxie,2013-07-15 20:39:00,1566,"Trojans, Deep cycle batteries, Bottom end lube and Injector oil???? Trolling motor advice or Bath house supplies?? I need a shower."
798292,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-15 20:53:00,8243," This is a G rated website, not XXX. That was good for a chuckle, thanks Moxie."
798295,misfish,2013-07-15 21:26:00,29133, LOL  Sometimes it comes out wrong.LOL
798299,davey buoy,2013-07-15 22:04:00,5505,My nautilus 1000 is at least 7 years old and has powered two gas boats and a electric motor on my canoe. Still cranking my v8 i/o. My 730 nautilus is only 3 years old so really can't make a good comparison yet. The price was right anyways!! I guess there is bad ones in every lot.To each's own I guess.These batteries are stored indoors and with no winter trickle charge.I just slow charge them in the spring before use.
798414,captpierre,2013-07-16 16:16:00,2521,"So, I cheaped out and bought the Kirklands.  They are charging at the moment.  Will let you know how they do  peter"
797963,captpierre,2013-07-13 22:39:00,2521,Gotta get 2 DC27 batteries for the 24V MinnKota.  Last ones were Dekas with the new boat.  Lasted 7 yrs.-not heavily used and babied.    Dealer wants $165 each  Costco has Kirkland (don't know who makes them).  same size  $90 each.  which would you buy?  on line they say fresh is key.  Costco's manufactured Apr /13
797964,misfish,2013-07-13 22:56:00,29133,"Oh my. Pike slayer has a story for you. I,ll let him tell it.LOL"
797969,workwear,2013-07-13 23:22:00,592,dekas!!!!  awwwsome batteries!!!
797996,NANUK,2013-07-14 00:58:00,797,"Deka without a doubt, Lebaron has size 31 for around $155 That's a good price IMO"
797997,Lape0019,2013-07-14 01:03:00,647,"I have heard good and bad about the deka's. the marina I use used to carry deka and switched to interstate because they had too many coming back. If you got 7 years out of the old ones though, you really can't complain.  I haven't heard anything bad about the kirkland's from Costco and you really can't complain about the price. If I remember correctly they are made by johnston controls."
798002,Dan668,2013-07-14 01:30:00,1120,"I know lots of people who use kirkland and deka, both have nothing bad to say about them. If im not mistaken, the same company who makes interstate makes kirkland.  I picked up two trojan 31's, which ran me $150 each. Third year, work great."
798021,Sinker,2013-07-14 04:31:00,8692,"Ya, they're both good. I got my last deep cycle at kawartha battery in ptbo. The fella there was saying that the batteries he sells there are the same as the kirklands, just a different label, for less $$$.......so far so good, but I just replaced them this season. Can't think of the name on them atm.....    S."
798027,wormdunker,2013-07-14 09:33:00,1711,"Please explain ""size 31""??"
798028,Roy,2013-07-14 09:53:00,13728," Group sizes (24, 27, 31) for batteries pertains to the physical size of a battery. This does not necessarily give a larger battery more amp/hours."
798029,wormdunker,2013-07-14 10:05:00,1711,Thanx Roy.
798030,Roy,2013-07-14 10:08:00,13728, Dekas are made by East Penn MFG.  Kirklands are made by Johnson Controls.
798051,Raf,2013-07-14 13:47:00,3495,i'm looking for a 31 series.  nautilus makes one but i'd like to look at a different brand this time.  who carries trojan batteries?  i'm in the orangeville area but work in mississauga so either area.  my costco membership lapsed so kirkland (i dont think they make a 31 series anyway) = no go.
798054,wormdunker,2013-07-14 14:04:00,1711,"Total battery in Barrie carries Trojan.  They also carry a new eco friendly battery that will last 3000 cycles, weighs 70% less than most batteries.  A normal lead acid battery will go through approximately 3 - 400 cycles. Now get this it's only $1,299.00.  What a deal!! I figure with my $165.00 Nautilus, if I go through 40 cycles per season that normal battery should last 8 years. There's a real good read at www.batterystuff.com.  Read their tutorials about batteries & chargers.  It explains it all!!  I just ordered the battery minder.  The battery minder has an electronic process which eliminates sulphation of the battery plates.  Sulphation is the killer of deep cycle batteries.  Also charges at 8 amps, then reduces to 4 amps, then 2 amps as the battery requires it.  Can't wait to try it out!"
798066,Roy,2013-07-14 14:55:00,13728," Raf, if you have a WalMart close by you can get an Everstart ....they used to be called Energizer. They're excellent batteries at a really good price."
798068,Raf,2013-07-14 15:02:00,3495,"thanks Roy, the EverStarts are 27 series.  I was hoping to go with a 31 again, just try a different brand.  I don't have the specs in front of me but, the 31 series nautilus I have provides significantly more run time than a 27 series.  mind you I could almost get two 27 series everstarts and hook them up in parallel for the cost of a 31 trojan."
798089,Sinker,2013-07-14 16:16:00,8692,"If you have room for 2 27's, your better off, Raf. Less drain on two, than one single. I paid $140 for my 31 deep cycle....same as kirkland, made by johnson controls.  S."
798117,grimsbylander,2013-07-14 18:55:00,3016,Come on Pike Slayer! Lol
798120,Roy,2013-07-14 19:23:00,13728, C'mon Simon. I want to hear this too!
798154,Drew_10,2013-07-14 23:59:00,111,"Buy a set of everstarts from walmart.  They cost about 90 bucks each, you'll get 15 bucks back for each of your old ones, and chances are they won't jerk you around if one of them dies early.  You're only running 27's so theres no real need to drop 165 bucks.  I've learned my lesson on that."
798177,landry,2013-07-15 01:51:00,1005,I will second that Landry
798183,nexstar,2013-07-15 02:12:00,63,I know a pro who goes through his batteries every 2 years.. He used Kirkland and switched to Deka hoping that it will last longer but he need a replacement after 2 years on his Deka also. So save yourself some money and get the Kirkland.
798198,bigmac1984,2013-07-15 03:32:00,193,"I just got the Everstart's at walmart as well. Price is good, comparable to the Kirkland brand in price."
798207,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-15 05:05:00,8243,When buying any battery check to see how many charges it will take from 80% full to 20% drained. There lies the difference between a $80.00 battery and a $150.00 battery. The number should be on the battery website.
798240,bassmasta,2013-07-15 14:20:00,27,"fyi, Walmart is now carrying 29 series Maxx EverStart DeepCycles  for $109  Over the last 4 years; I had the Nautilus ones crap out on my just after a year. Both the Kirkland and EverStart deepcycles running great to this day.  I keep them on the Ctek trickle charger when not in use"
798244,Roy,2013-07-15 14:50:00,13728,"I won't touch any CTC Nautilus product whether it be a charger, tender or battery."
