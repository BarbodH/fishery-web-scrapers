798464,peter23,2013-07-16 21:49:00,95,"I have always been a bucktail kind of guy while muskie fishing but have never given suicks or sledges a try. yes I have used bulldogs, cranks etc. but many people have been saying that suicks and sledges have been there go-to lures for fishing skis. ii have a couple of each but they have barely hit the water. just wondering if you guys can give me tips as to which colors work best in the kawarthas, where to fish these jerkbaits and how to fish them.  thanks!

798465,lew,2013-07-16 21:54:00,12766,"Most productive Sledge for me is a Strawberry color and for Suicks, perch works well,  and for both baits I recommend the largest, weighted version.  In warm water work them fast and eratic over heavy weeds and you'll do well."
798496,Pigeontroller,2013-07-17 00:19:00,2793,"Try a Hellhound as well, great fast erractic action when twitched hard and fast."
798521,mistyriver1,2013-07-17 01:52:00,600,I've had some luck with baby loon color in a sledge in the kawarthas.
798534,captpierre,2013-07-17 02:49:00,2521,I know what a Suick is.  Gotta look up a Sledge.
798544,mike rousseau,2013-07-17 06:06:00,4661,Biggest thing for me with those 2 baits is rhythm... They take some getting used to...  And like Dax suggested... Hell hounds are good baits... Especially for anglers new to herbaits/glidebaits....You can't work them wrong... And they are already weighted to sink slowly...   ...
798558,esoxansteel,2013-07-17 13:29:00,1307,"Blaze Orange Dark Gold Sides, is my most productive Suick, both suicks and Sledges can be trolled as well as casted, Sledges troll faster then Suicks, but trolling allows you to cover water quicker, but casting allows you to pick apart productive areas."

798572,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-07-17 15:38:00,535,Sledges are my favourite musky baits.
798587,lew,2013-07-17 18:59:00,12766,I threw my strawberry Sledge for a couple hours this morning and all I got for my troubles was a silly bass that thought he was a big fish.
798590,misfish,2013-07-17 19:20:00,29133,"  Should of trolled with a worm harness.  And stop fishing for them bass,they will hurt your shoulder."
