798132,Bill Shearer,2013-07-14 21:42:00,456,"Far better to take care of it right away, rather than getting medical help at the local ER. It hurts far more later."
798137,ckrb2007,2013-07-14 22:19:00,449,Plus you'd miss out on the day fishing.
798146,trevy727,2013-07-14 23:15:00,351,That's awesome!
798161,ckrb2007,2013-07-15 00:16:00,449,"LOL....I loved the ""pop"" sound it made on the way out."
798168,boombap,2013-07-15 00:41:00,310,Good stuff.  That's some nasty bass thumb.

798205,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-15 04:56:00,8243,"Have had to remove a treble from my hand a few times. Use the heavy test line method to pull down past the barn and it pops out. Saw a guy lose a eye from a treble hook. That was gruesome. Always wear glasses, always.  An uncle in NY goes to the vet when he can't get a hook out, more than once.... much cheaper then the ER.  Funny how a small puncture can hurt that badly."
