798175,landry,2013-07-15 01:48:00,1005,Does anyone know where I can get plastisol for pouring soft plastics in Ontario??? I have got this crazy urge to start pouring my own designs. I have been checking out some very cool youtube videos on using sculpt modeling clay to make prototypes and doing plaster or bondy resin molds to pour them. I could sure use some guidance and advice on where to get my stuff and on what plastic/softener/salt mixes people have used to make senkos:) I have a very ambitious idea of making a large paddletail shad bait with interchangeable lead heads that can be casted or jigged in St Clair but I think I will start simple with a one piece mold for dropshot or flipping trailers. Thanks Landry
