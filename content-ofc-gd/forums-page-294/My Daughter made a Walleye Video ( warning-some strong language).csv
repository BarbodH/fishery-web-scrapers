798456,moparhawk,2013-07-16 21:05:00,146,Shes a good fisherman and just starting Walleye fishing but shes doing pretty well. This time of year in Kansas we're only fishing 7' deep. I laughed my butt off but her language is a little strong. 
798462,solopaddler,2013-07-16 21:26:00,8605,"That was great, mesmerizing in fact."
798467,Skud,2013-07-16 22:08:00,739,Very entertaining! A future fishing show career perhaps?
798471,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-16 22:39:00,8243,"Someone's taught her well. Good job Mopar. Must be nice to have good strong young teeth. Buy the kid a line cutter, I cringed every time I watched her bite off the line. That line looked pretty heavy for Pickerel. I have never seen a flathead, very interesting, looks like a white Pic with dark spots. Do they taste similar to Walleye Mopar?"
798472,Rod Caster,2013-07-16 22:40:00,5784,"She's got no fear of fish at all...I'd show this to my wife, but I doubt she'll take away the right message."
798473,Fisherman,2013-07-16 22:41:00,7201,I had visions of a booby fish in the middle of the screen..she has potential for a real fishing girl show.
798476,Roy,2013-07-16 22:46:00,13728, A flathead is a type of catfish.
798477,moparhawk,2013-07-16 22:50:00,146,"That's kind of you guys, thanks. She just lives to fish and she's been making these crazy videos. Awesome kid."
798480,dhickey,2013-07-16 23:29:00,1038,Simply outstanding.. The raw emotion was refreshing..   The first time I swore in front of my Dad was when I was 10 and I meant every word.. It was over a fish that broke my line.
798489,Whitespinnerbait,2013-07-16 23:53:00,2038,Awesome !  Enough said right there !
798504,iFish4real,2013-07-17 00:54:00,386,I wanna know your daughter
798511,Dozer,2013-07-17 01:15:00,896,10:08 to the end is just priceless.  Awesome video of a pretty girl who loves fishing... future in TV fishing shows?  Thanks for the share
798523,moparhawk,2013-07-17 02:07:00,146,I understand entirely  I believe that her goal  She is (gulp) somewhat raw. Glad you understand her  I show this to her. Thanks  She insists on coming with me to Canada next summer. It would be my joy if she met a Canadian young man.  HaHa I rewatched it and agree!
798526,preroller,2013-07-17 02:14:00,18,"you should be proud! I lol'd multiple times.  Go Chiefs! My aunt and uncle live in Olathe, been to a few games."

798720,corvette1,2013-07-18 14:18:00,1765,awesome video keep posting them
798736,TJQ,2013-07-18 15:10:00,7806,That was awesome..   I would have loved to see what she would have done if she'd got that big one up to the kayak!!! --  Someone send that girl some fireline or powerpro!!
