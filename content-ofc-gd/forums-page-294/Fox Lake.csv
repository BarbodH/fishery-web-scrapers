I have done some research on the lake with regards to fishing but if anyone knows the lake and would like to share some general information on fishing the lake, please send me a PM. I am not looking for honey holes or anything like that just general information and or tips.  Also if anyone has ever rented up that way and has anything in general to share about the area or lake that would be great. We are really looking forward to a relaxing week mostly playing in the water with kids.   Thanks, Mark"
