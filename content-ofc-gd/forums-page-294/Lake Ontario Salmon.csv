797317,Lunkerhunter,2013-07-09 17:33:00,455,Last year I bought a new boat and started to learn how to fish out on lake ontario for salmon. With some help from some awesome friends i was able to pick it up pretty quickly. This year has been shaping up to be one heck of a year with 2 fish pushing 30 pounds already. I can only hope this pattern continues throughout the derby and I can get my name on the board.  it is pretty awesome when you have a fish peel close to 500 feet of line. Lake Ontario has one hell of a fishery thats for sure.  here are the pictures.  
797318,BillM,2013-07-09 17:41:00,17367,Nice kings!!!   Any reason why you've got your dipsy setup so high off the water?
797319,Lunkerhunter,2013-07-09 17:50:00,455,"hey bill, just noticed that. no reason really .hahahaa probably didnt realize it was up that high.  i havent been getting too many on my dipsy's. would that affect it?"
797321,BillM,2013-07-09 18:13:00,17367," You'd probably gain a few feet by bringing it down a little, but I can't see that being the reason why you haven't had it fire yet...   When I'm out there I run a pretty standard SD+fly setup on both mine... Setting #3, as far as as it takes, lol.    I still don't have confidence in them to be honest but it's fun fighting those giants on braid!"
797324,davey buoy,2013-07-09 18:53:00,5505,"Great day for you,and to think people travel 2 hours plus to fish,and don't even look in thier own backyard.What a fishery!!!!!!!"
797336,spincast,2013-07-09 20:00:00,3279,Nice going - the North shore is definitely the hot zone this year.
797340,asdve23rveavwa,2013-07-09 20:15:00,2690,"Awesome stuff Andrew!!  Those are some really nice kings, and, great photos of them too!!"
797360,Fang,2013-07-09 21:52:00,1330,"I run mine at that level and even a bit higher only to try and make them stand out a bit more from the other set ups (lead core, riggers) Kind of mid way between a rigger and a board. Shakers on the dipsey rod with +200 feet of line out can be hard to detect and i run 50-50 spoon to fly set ups on these rods. The higher rod gives a bit more sensitivity to something dragging - it's also one heck of a wake up call when a big one slams it"
797387,Joey,2013-07-09 23:59:00,9122,"Wow, beauty fish!!"
797391,Sinker,2013-07-10 00:09:00,8692,Nice work boys!  Our divers have been HOT! More fish on them than anything else. Almost always kings. Set them back over 200ft on a 3 setting and see what happens.  S.
797441,FloatnFly,2013-07-10 12:11:00,1640,"been hearing from the charter guys about the abundance of baitfish this year. could lead to some 4olb+ fish this summer, can';t wait to hit these guys and gals in august/september"
797444,Oryx,2013-07-10 12:31:00,186,What size Dipsey are you running?
797449,BillM,2013-07-10 14:13:00,17367, Would be nice to see some giants like we used to when I was growing up..  Top fish in the Salmon Hunt was always a low to mid 40lb fish!
797466,fishnsled,2013-07-10 17:02:00,3520,"Awesome fishing!!  Nicely done Andrew and company.  I've been marking lots of bait as well but nothing like I did on Sunday, screen was full of bait for the longest time.  I'd say there was just as much bait last year as well."

798123,sleded,2013-07-14 20:06:00,96,nice fish sir just wondering where you are lanching from and how deep. I lanched out of grimsby and trolled around 120 feet and only got bows and a small king. we were using NK28 thinkin maybe i should switch to a SD
798125,steelhunter,2013-07-14 20:30:00,81,There are some big boys out there
