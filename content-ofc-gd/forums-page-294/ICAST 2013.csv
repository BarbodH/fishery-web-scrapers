797690,ah_long,2013-07-11 18:55:00,354,"  Daiwa takes the cake for me this year in iCast, the Tatula rod and reel feels really nice in hand for the price point. The difference between the regular and the Type R ver. on the Tatula is CRBB and the Zaion drag star."
797695,BillM,2013-07-11 19:09:00,17367,Is that actual carbon fiber or a really bad wrap?
797696,Bassaholic,2013-07-11 19:15:00,74,No difference in the spools???
797697,bare foot wader,2013-07-11 19:23:00,1354,"that 13 fishing teardrop reel looks interesting...but their model from last year was one of the biggest wastes of $100 for me...this time I'll wait for the reviews  the AGS guides have a carbon frame...from my experience with carbon brake levers and shifter knobs (mountain biking), carbon snaps and you're done for the day, too fragile, I wouldn't trust myself with those...bending a rod guide is easily the most common f-up I do to my rods"
797716,Lape0019,2013-07-11 21:32:00,647,I do like the fact that Abu Garcia will be allowing select e-tailers to carry their Jdm reels. It would be pretty cool if I could get a revo elite 8 up here without having to order it from Japan. I would prefer to get a shimano or daiwa but I have no issues with Abu either
797717,kickingfrog,2013-07-11 21:42:00,8333,"I had read an article a month or so ago about whether it made good business sense to still have Japanese and a North American versions of products like reels. The times, they are a changin'"
797719,Lape0019,2013-07-11 21:49:00,647,"I personally don't see the point but I have read some interesting arguments about why there are still differences and not one global market product. Apparently, us North Americans are a lot harder on our reels than our Japanese counter parts.  That is one if the reasons we have a anti reverse pawl I. Our shimano baitcasters like the curado where their scorpion only has the bearing."
798162,Wolf 3,2013-07-15 00:20:00,134," Lape0019, Looks like the the stradic CI4FA will have x ship. http://www.basspro.com/Shimano-Stradic-CI4FA-Spinning-Reels/product/1306150615101/"
798169,Lape0019,2013-07-15 00:46:00,647,"Yeah,  I saw it there as well but the shimano site did not mention it so I was confused. Someone else confirmed wih that via Facebook and shimano has bow added that it comes with x ship on their website. The more I read about it, there may actually be a need to swap at least one of my ci4's out"
797477,BucktownAngler,2013-07-10 18:49:00,582,saw these new baitball lures by livetarget. looks pretty cool. its supposed to imitate schooling baitfish.    
797479,kickingfrog,2013-07-10 18:51:00,8333,"Saw those. Interesting. I'm not sure I'll buy them, but I'd be more likely to try them over an alabama rig."
797480,snagged,2013-07-10 18:52:00,67,That's looks great. I'll definitely grab a few to try. Amazing what they come up with.
797485,BillM,2013-07-10 19:24:00,17367,"Looks silly, but I'm sure people will buy them, lol!  Waiting to here about Lakemaster/Humminbird and the new acquisition by Johnson Outdoors of the Dr.Depth software.    Custom maps for my HB here we come!"
797493,musky_hunter,2013-07-10 19:51:00,328,with a fast moving bait you'll most likely seem like 1 fish only....looking forward to the tatula reels
797495,mercman,2013-07-10 19:52:00,7054,I bet the perch one (if there is one) would be killer!!!
797525,davey buoy,2013-07-10 22:12:00,5505,Most of there baits are killer IMO. I just lose to many and they cost a premium.lol.
797528,fishindevil,2013-07-10 22:27:00,6254,Looks like another lure used to catch fishermen not fish !!! Lol... Live target makes some awesome stuff I use their frogs their mice and their perch diving cranks !!! But that new one looks a little over the top to me ??? Well I will wait till I read reviews on all the new stuff !!!! Cheers
797530,Lape0019,2013-07-10 22:29:00,647,Those are all awesome looking baits. I am lookin forward to seeing the chronarch ci4+ reel I person but it looks a lot better than I thought it would. I was thinking it would be like the 2013 metanium.I read the product write up of the Tatula on tackletour and it may be the reel that makes me go try a daiwa. I have never been a daiwa vs shimano kind of guy and have had almost all other major brands except daiwa so it could be exciting
797533,frodobuggins,2013-07-10 22:47:00,127,Should be good.  I'm going to wait for the affordable Canadian Tire knock off
797569,jeffw,2013-07-11 00:52:00,267,I was just watching Agnew vids from today on tackleware house and the revolution rocket looks pretty crazy at 9:1 ratio. The live target shrimp looks pretty impressive for the saltwater guys
797574,Christopheraaron,2013-07-11 01:14:00,3525,Those baits look awesome! Not sure if they'll really make a difference but I'll wait for the reviews

797598,young_one,2013-07-11 03:25:00,620,"Humminbird Bowmount 360 Scan... Please take my money, if I have enough."
797623,MCTFisher9120,2013-07-11 12:34:00,3761,"Looking forward to the new Chronarch CI4+, as well as some of the new models of G.Loomis NRX rods!"
797629,Lape0019,2013-07-11 12:53:00,647," Well,  I am glad someone understood what I wrote!!! apparently typing out a few sentances on an iphone while extremely tired is not a good idea. I originally was all over the T3 reels. Loved the concept and hated the looks so I held off. The Tatula has a great design and still icorporates the T wing system so I will at least be checking it out."
797631,MCTFisher9120,2013-07-11 12:57:00,3761,Only downfall is the plastic hood...they break and I've dealt with close to 9 or 10 reels over a 2 year span...not a ton but definitely something to consider when buying a reel for a season or 10. Nice material cool line guide but moving parts break over time...Wonder if they will get back into the rod world this summer
797632,Live2fish85,2013-07-11 13:01:00,1633,"The new Chronarch Ci4 looks to be a awesome reel, as does the new Ci4 spinning reel which will now have Xship."
797640,musky_hunter,2013-07-11 13:28:00,328,"i broke my t3 after 2 outings, crash course in using a new reel design! LOL...."
797648,Hooked_On_Bass,2013-07-11 14:14:00,7,I'm pretty excited about the new Chronarch CI4! Looks sharp.
797654,Lape0019,2013-07-11 14:39:00,647," Where did you read it has x ship? I only ask because I am certain it does but it is not listed as a feature on the shimano website. One of the guys on another forum was considering buying one but only if it had x ship and when he saw that on shimano's site, he was pretty dissapointed. I am still of the impression it has it, I just wante to see it from a reputable source."
