797856,sneak_e_pete,2013-07-13 00:44:00,540,What documentation do you need to provide when selling a boat.  Trailer registration for sure...anything else?  How does the new owner get the pleasure craft license switched to them?  Thanks in advance
798288,Old Ironmaker,2013-07-15 20:23:00,8243,"You need to provide at least Pleasure Craft License provided by Transport Canada.  Info at 1-800-926-9105. As well as trailer ownership from MOT, Ontario. That's all I received when registering my used boat at the local Federal Gov office, the trailer at the Ministry of Transportation office."
798293,Walleye72,2013-07-15 20:53:00,156,"You need to provide the following things:  1.  The pleasurecraft license paper which can be used by the new owner for 90 days  2.  Signed trailer ownership  3.  A bill of sale.  Some people choose to separate the items in the package.  ie they buy the boat, motor and trailer separately.  A Bill of Sale template can be found here:  http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/marinesafety/billofsale-actedevente-eng.pdf  Don't forget to take your plate off the trailer before it drives away.
