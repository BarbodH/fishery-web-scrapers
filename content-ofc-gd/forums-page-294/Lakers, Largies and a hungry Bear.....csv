Joined two fellas from my local FH message board over the past week and as usual these trips are always a hoot.Cprince and I fished a lake over in PQ.  STUPID numbers of fish.  I think I had 9 Largies in the boat before he casted once ( he's a slow knot tyer    ), all on cranks.It rain all day and while the size sucked we had a blast.I then had DropShot'r n board.  We went to Muskrat, it sucked.  We had a dozen in the boat by noon with 2 3 lbers for our efforts.  I made the call to bail and head elsewhere.  Great call.  They ate everything there including open water frogging.I did catch a freakin snapping turtle on a jig, that was interesting!My buddy Rob and I did a Laker trolling day.  I loved that, effortless fish catching!.  His Terrova with Ipilot did the trick.Steelhead rods landed us 10 for 12 on this kicked back day!Grant and I had a great day on the jig the other day, excuse Grant's pics as I had to crop them as he fished in his gitch because he showed up in jeans for a forecasted 30 degree day...  :w00t:We finally kept a few fish for the table.  Birdee BBQ'd em up and they were tasty, so they say!  And finally my first Duker for 2013.... Starting another weeks holidays today.  3 booked trips and 3 fun days on tap.  Gonna have to go to the Rideau River soon, Birdee and I are fishin the MSBassin event on the river early August and haven't been on it for Bass in 12 years...great event to consider fishing, great cause and fun day!RJP.S. The Bears like Lay's at our place FYI..."

797111,davey buoy,2013-07-08 19:25:00,5505,"Great fishing report!!!!!!!!!!,but that bear is a little close for comfort if you ask me.  .lol."
797118,solopaddler,2013-07-08 20:05:00,8605,"Sweet bunch of fish, well done!"

797439,Cudz,2013-07-10 11:50:00,2652,Nice!
797474,Fish4Eyes,2013-07-10 18:07:00,1022,"Nice report. If you keep feeding that bear it will associate humans with food, be careful."
797793,cybergear,2013-07-12 16:01:00,4,nice catch
797857,FloatnFly,2013-07-13 00:48:00,1640, looks like it already does....won't be long before mnr handles it
797858,GbayGiant,2013-07-13 00:54:00,1780,Looks like a tame wild Bear to me Booboo.
797859,farsider,2013-07-13 01:04:00,456,"Nice catch!  That Bear in the Vex t-shirt looks more wild!  Cheers, Mark"
797894,siwash,2013-07-13 10:33:00,683,not a good idea to feed bears or let them get that close... don't post this on OOD! Those guys won't be happy!
797906,DropShot'r,2013-07-13 13:23:00,62,Thanks for a great day on the water Rob.  Steve    I'm with the bear on the Salt & Vinegar chips
798188,jayess,2013-07-15 02:32:00,187,"beauty fish, man!  i've got to echo an above comment -- don't feed the bears. Makes for a great picture, but imagine your son, nephew, grandchild etc. with a bag of chips in cottage country. Not cool."
798246,Freshtrax,2013-07-15 14:52:00,2215,I got to agree....feeding bears leads to dead bears.
