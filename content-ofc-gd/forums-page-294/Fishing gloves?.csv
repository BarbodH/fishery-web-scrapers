He has been wearing some surgical gloves, but they get rips and holes in them easily, and the sweat builds up inside. I can see the same sweat problem happening if he wore kitchen gloves. Is there any sort of glove made for anglers that allows for some sort of breathability? Can't find anything on-line, except for ice-fishing gloves. They would obviously be a bit uncomfortable on a 30C day."
798037,woodenboater,2013-07-14 12:36:00,2277,"One would think thin goretex gloves would be the ticket but maybe look into this hand cream to see if it will do. Lee Valley sells it but I would think you could find it other places as well.  http://www.leevalley.com/en/garden/page.aspx?p=10256&cat=2,42407,33246   the manufacturer's webpage with all the info you'll need (includes MSDS etc)  http://www.glovesinabottle.ca/index.php"
798040,Ralph Field,2013-07-14 13:07:00,1018,I've noticed that some anglers and fishing guides in the southern US are wearing scarves and gloves to protect there exposed skin to the harmful rays of the sun. Perhaps Googling sun protective wear might yield some results for gloves. Amazon sells what you are looking for under $20 you can get:

798212,fishindevil,2013-07-15 08:36:00,6254,"What about the rapala fillet glove ??? They are multi purpose and can also be used as a tailing glove !!!! They work awesome I have used them for way over 20yrs !!! And they will breathe they are made for cleaning fish to protect your fingers from the knife but back in the 80""s when they an put the steelheaders like myself used them for tailing gloves you can grab or hold a fish with them and rinse them off and good to go !!!! I think they will suit your needs perfect !!! Check them out Canadian tire has them most places carry them !!!!!"
798225,aplumma,2013-07-15 11:28:00,6896,There are heavier nitrile gloves that have a cotton base that slip on and off easily at Home Depot or Costco. The back of them is spandex so you breath out the back of the hand and they cling to your hands. They are easy on and off and they can be washed easily.  http://www.homedepot.com/p/Firm-Grip-Nitrile-Coated-Polyester-Work-Gloves-5550/202021244#.UePcno2TiSo    Art
