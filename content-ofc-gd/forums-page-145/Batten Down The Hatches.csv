950403,John Bacon,2015-12-23 23:54:00,3277,"It has been a windy month.  This Friday will be the only day that the winds will die down enough to get my boat out on Lake Ontario.  Unfortunately, I don't think that taking the boat out on Christmas morning will sit well with the family."

950499,misfish,2015-12-24 18:32:00,29133,Well I hope you're casting downwind otherwise duck for the egg sinker.  Now that was wind. The ram was back and forth on the open field roads. The float was still in the drifts at time. Friday looks like a better day. LOL
950504,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-24 19:12:00,8243,No wind to speak of here on the north shore of Erie but 1 to 2 meter high waves crashing on the beach. Not a good day for trolling for Pics. It sure is pretty though.

950575,Rod Caster,2015-12-25 02:02:00,5784,"Actually I removed comprehensive coverage earlier this year. I may be able to get the car back on the road, it all depends if the A-pillar is too far bent and if a windshield can still fit. Either way I e got some work and spendatures ahead of me. I'll post some pics next time I'm at the computer"
