I do want to post this as many of you know me you know my family means the most to me. Our business also revolves around family friends and giving back. Well this year I had the bright idea to bring our logo to life. After doing a lot of research online I had convinced myself that we needed a Mascott  it was easy to convince Danna she loved the idea and the kids well that was a no brainer as my daughter loves to act and already has lots of time as other Mascotts. I found many companies in the USA but wanted to stay in Canada I found a small company out of Toronto that started with two friends no they have 24 employees and do them for people all over the world they are Maydewell Mascott if you want to look them up.  Anyway here is the first look of BARZ who will be at musky Sunday February 14th at the Toronto Spring Fishing Show.
