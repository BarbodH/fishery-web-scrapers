Although we get together during the year for special occasions, we always get together a week before Christmas at the local pizza and beer pub (for us that's the Prescott). This year we had 15 guys in attendance. And as usual, we all updated each other on our ailments (we're all seniors between 72 and 81 years of age). Two of our guys underwent open heart surgery during 2015. Fortunately, we are all still walking on the right side of the grass. And some of us still very much enjoy wetting our lines for walleye in August and September each year.  I'm grateful to be alive and to be a member of this group.  Seasons Greetings everyone."
