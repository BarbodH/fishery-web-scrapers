850168,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-26 01:26:00,10439,Any body used them and have a review for me. Looking at picking up a couple for the boat. They look very similar to the Folbe Advantage rod holders which are quite good. So any OFNers have them or used them? Enquiring minds want to know.
850174,captpierre,2014-04-26 01:41:00,2521,I have two and use them for braid/dypsie rods on Lake O and muskie trolling on the Kawarthas.  So far so good.
850175,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-26 01:43:00,10439,Nice!!! If they hold up to sammins and ski's they'll hold up to giant lakers and poikes!!!
850189,Tim Mills,2014-04-26 03:31:00,476,Lots of positive comments about orca s on spoonpullers
850192,Old Ironmaker,2014-04-26 04:33:00,8243,"I have 2 on my boat Drifter and pull lead core and large dipsies on Erie and Ontario, never had an issue. Buddy caught a commercial net last year no problem."
850194,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-26 04:49:00,10439,I'm convinced!!! Going to order a pair in the morning. I have a full set of the power lock holders now but am looking forward to the quick release of the ORCA.
850233,Meegs,2014-04-26 13:40:00,249,"Ive got friends that charter on lake o, they swear by them, preffered over the berts track systems"
850234,Fisherpete,2014-04-26 13:42:00,1814,"Yup, they are rock solid. A few friends of mine use them for muskies and salmon, and after seeing how good they were last year I picked up 2 sets for my boat this summer."
850256,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-26 15:22:00,10439,Thanks a lot everyone!!!
850651,Fishing4Tails,2014-04-28 11:35:00,38,Awesome product by Scotty !! Orcas are great for all reels spinning or trolling.. Plus Canadian made.  I switched a few years ago my riggers to Scotty's no problem and super fast .
850653,dave524,2014-04-28 11:50:00,4508,Lot of guys swear by Down East Salties too.
850677,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-28 14:45:00,10439,Lot of guys swear by Down East Salties too.  I've seen some of the Down East holders fail and it's not  pretty watching your expensive gear fly off the boat.
850685,bare foot wader,2014-04-28 16:12:00,1354,"happy with mine, they've held up to heavy hits from sturgeon and salmon...I never lock the rods in either and feel comfortable with them bouncing around in some big swells, the rods sit nicely in them"
850687,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-28 16:20:00,10439,The ones I have seen fail are the clamp on ones. Had guests up @ the lodge bring them up and watched the clamps snap and rods went over board while trolling T60's for lakers. Happened twice in about an hour.  Luckily the quick thinking guide    instantly did a big circle and managed to catch the downed rod with the other line to retrieve the rod and reel. TWICE!!!!!

Were those the double clamp; or the single clamp model?  I may have to start tethering my rods.

They can't handle the stress of a T60 Flatfish over long periods of use. Especially if you're pounding bottom with them.  FYI, I bought the Orca's and they are awesome holders!!!!"
949960,esoxansteel,2015-12-20 15:28:00,1307,"Trolling T60s for Muskies, and I assume Lakers,  what happens is the violent shaking of the lure, and in between the violent shaking there is a slight pause, or slack, that causes the S10 Salties to raise, and pop out of there position, and your rod and reel are now heading to the water if not tethered, Trolling normal crank baits there is always a constant drag or pressure which keeps the holder in its place, not with T60s though, as there is that brief pause or slack when things can go wrong"
949997,chris.brock,2015-12-20 22:43:00,4053,Here's Fishndevil (Shawn) with the Orca.

So, I will probably be fine running dipseys which is my main use for the Salties."

No, the ones I spoke about broke. One of the legs broke (the forward one) and before you could get your hands on the rod the aft one would snap. The rod and the bulk of the holder went overboard while the legs and thumb screws ended up in the bottom of the boat."
