949795,lew,2015-12-18 20:54:00,12766,Always lots to be proud of with Canada's soldiers

949797,irishfield,2015-12-18 21:03:00,26272,"They do indeed, but as Roy use to commonly post... ""there has to be a forum for this stuff""!"
949800,Big Cliff,2015-12-18 21:28:00,6899,"They do indeed, but as Roy use to commonly post... ""there has to be a forum for this stuff""! I think it is great that we post stuff like this on here, they deserve all the praise and recognition we can give them!"
949801,irishfield,2015-12-18 21:32:00,26272,"Okay, carry on, a political forum it will become. I have no issue with that, darn proud of my older brother that did every hell hole theatre, including the Gulf War, for the 20 years he served. Just find it pretty strange how the ""geography"" has changed here."
949804,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-18 21:47:00,10439," Just find it pretty strange how the ""geography"" has changed here.  Looks the same to me. Here's a pic I took yesterday. It looked the same 20 years ago!!!!  "
949807,Acountdeleted,2015-12-18 21:58:00,2562,"It makes sense. It's 'no ice' ice season. For the casual fishermen on here, it's hard to get out with no ice and cold waters.  Reports will be up as soon as we get some hard water."

949821,GBW,2015-12-19 00:33:00,8460,"Back when I was a Ranger, I was a great shot and I wore a helmet. I trust a helmet a bit more to try and save my life than a ball cap..."

949829,Sinker,2015-12-19 01:16:00,8692,I think he is referring to the two soldiers in the pic with caps instead of helmets.  S
949835,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-19 02:34:00,8243,"I don't see lauding the commitment and skill that our individual sailors, airmen and soldiers have is political in any way whatsoever. When speaking of the military machine and ones stance on military conflict then it can get political, yes, definitely. I have a young cousin south that has chosen a life in the US Army as his forever career to provide for his family until earning his retirement.  He has told us more than once there is no better soldier to have his back ( there is a term for this of which I can't recall ) than a Canuck Special Force soldier. He has put in his time with 3 tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan on the ground . He was recruited right out of High School.  He is amongst an elite group as he is an Army Ranger and now recruits in southern Illinois. When he says he wants a Canadian soldier next to him in  a firefight I believe that says much. I am proud of our boys and girls over there. We want our freedoms and everything that goes along with it but some disagree as to how it is earned and maintained.  Johnny D"

Johnny D Canadian soldiers have 6 months of basic training, US have 6 weeks. When I got out of the army in 68 I was a PFC, I went down to the US to see about joining the US army and was accepted immediatly and would have started out as a sargent because of my training. All I had left to do was pick up my visa and I met a girl end of story LOL.  As for the helmits; wouldn't stop a direct hit from a .762 round and if the bullet would have grazed the helmit it would have missed your head anyway. Not saying they shouldn't have been wearing them but who knows how much time they had to respond to the attack. Lets see go find my helmit or shoot back??????"
949853,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-19 11:51:00,8243,Thanks for your service Big Cliff.

Yeah, I'm guessing the picture with the ball caps isn't from the Mosul, probably just a training pic, it looks pretty lush in the background."
