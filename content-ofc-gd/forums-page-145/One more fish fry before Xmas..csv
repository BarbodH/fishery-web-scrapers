The bite was good ten days ago and even better this time around. Got enough for a fish fry each. all the action from 15' to 13' FOW. Jigs and minnows with 6 inches of ice.  Happy Xmas to you all, thanks to Roy and all the admins for the unenviable task of keeping this place together and avoiding world war III on a regular basis.   Tight lines and may Santa be kind   Simon.     "

950409,Tomcat,2015-12-24 00:19:00,395,"Thanks again for sharing Simon. While I'm envious of your easy access to ice fishing and fresh walleye, as a senior, I'm not a fan of cold weather any more. Weather forecast for Ottawa area tomorrow is +16.   I might wash my truck in the lane way tomorrow just to set a new date record."
