I've actually been here since Sunday but didn't have much luck until last night. It was a pretty cool day. We started out cast netting pilchards (tiny baitfish) and then brought them to a local marina where we caught catfish for shark bait. Catfish are the worst shark bait, however blacktips seem to like them and I figured a fresh bloody catfish was better than the frozen bait I had from previous days. So we set to the beach at 4pm and at 630 the reel which I had dropped a bait out on the kayak 350 yards starts screaming. I apologize that the shark footage isn't great, I had a talk with the cameraman about filming at night when it was all done. Either way an epic day of fishing going right up the food chain!  "

949705,Rizzo,2015-12-17 23:42:00,4754,Nice! was hard to tell...were you able to get the hook out or do you just cut the line?
949730,PBenson,2015-12-18 02:36:00,154,I was able to get the hook out. It took longer than I'd liked but it came out. Also lost a huge shark tonight. Likely a bull haha
949732,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-18 02:50:00,956,Enjoy yourself bud.  Keep us updated
949733,PBenson,2015-12-18 02:58:00,154,"Tonight we had 4 runs total. Two of them hooked. The first bit through 1 foot of cable and into my 500lb line and got off. Couldn't believe that, had to be huge. The second straightened a 16/0 circle hook. Crazy night lol. Some big sharks out there."
949748,Rizzo,2015-12-18 12:37:00,4754,yipes. Straightening a big hook like that takes some force. Stay out of the water!
949751,PBenson,2015-12-18 12:54:00,154,I don't think anyone should ever swim at sunset lol. It's asking for trouble.
949773,msp,2015-12-18 16:26:00,1336,From Musky to sharks ! well done
949787,limeyangler,2015-12-18 20:00:00,5204,That is coolâ€¦.love saltwater fishing!
949845,Freshtrax,2015-12-19 05:29:00,2215,"nice i tried in nc in the spring for sharks with no luck, i was only casting from shore the yack dropping the bait is a great idea"
949849,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-19 08:17:00,8243,"Very nice. Your videography will improve, the key is to get onto the fish and you have, We had a place in Charlotte Harbor and fished with some success around Punta Gorda for Shark at night. Once I met a few local guys that night fished for Shark my success rate went from bad to fairly good. Location, presentation and population. I used a 7 foot Salt water rod and a Okuma castable line counter I learned to chuck fairly well. Nice to have the line counter in the dark. One of the young guys would take his line out with his Sea Doo hundreds of yards out. When the tides and currents changed it was tough to keep lines apart in the dark. Glow in the dark balloons worked great with a good light."
949860,PBenson,2015-12-19 13:20:00,154,"I have two videos on my YouTube channel catching sharks on casted baits, that's how I got started. You just need a 12 foot heavy action rod that can get your baits way out there (40-70 yards). I also recommend fishing sunrise or sunset with casted baits as that's when sharks will come in closer to feed."
