949008,JoePa,2015-12-13 16:15:00,179,"Yes - there's something about a dog - they are so trusting, and always look to please you - I had a small Westie that was my best fishing partner for a long time - I always remember - years ago when my wife was still living - I would come home from work and my wife would be busy at the sink getting dinner ready - she'd hardly notice me coming in the door - but not Annie - she'd be there wagging her tail waiting by the door to greet me - the one problem is that they don't really live that long -"

949579,chris.brock,2015-12-17 00:09:00,4053,"Winston left my family this afternoon. Exact same symptoms/ situation as Muskie.  At the vet's, there were plenty of tears, from our vet too. I know it's her job and she has been doing it for quite a while, but as we were leaving she said something that struck a chord.  She said - I've seen people drop off their dog to be put down, hand over the dog, pay the bill, then stroll out the door. It's a terrible day but I can tell you guys cared and are great pet people.  I can tell from your post TJ, Muskie had a great family and life too.  And please, I don't want a single person to reply to my reply or mention it, I just wanted to say this. Not one comment please. Thanks.  We're sad, but that's a good thing because we cared and our dogs had love and good lives."

One of the hardest things Ive ever had to do.  Countless trips in the bush he made with us, and was really the best dog ever.  It sure is quiet around here.  Muskie, 2001-2015         "
