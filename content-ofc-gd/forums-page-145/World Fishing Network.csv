950156,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-22 04:53:00,8243,"I saved over 80 bucks since cancelling the World Fishing Commercial 4 years ago. Disappointing to say the least. The same 30 or 60 minute infomercial on 50 times or more  in the same week. I don't like to use the word hate, but it's close."
950169,dave524,2015-12-22 11:12:00,4508,"I found it but it won't play  Same here, tried it yesterday when Pump posted, broke. It did work a week ago , JP De Rose was at some trade show making the rounds of a bunch of con artists."
