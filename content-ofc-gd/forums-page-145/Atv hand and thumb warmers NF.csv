Yes the hand guards do help, but I loved the new windshield I installed.  Block the wind & it makes a world of difference.  Contact your Honda dealer, they'll probably have warmers to suit your machine.  There's a wiring harness you'll need to fit your existing harness.  A slick trick to removing your rubber grips is to use a compressor to blow off the grips.  Very simple. PM me if you would like further info"
