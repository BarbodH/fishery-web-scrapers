950342,lew,2015-12-23 17:38:00,12766,4 times today when I tried to visit this site I got the message that it was unavailable. Same message we were receiving awhile back when this site was down.  I've also noticed it sometimes takes awhile for the site to open for me while others are basically instantly.  Just me or are others having issues too ??

950397,wormdunker,2015-12-23 23:21:00,1711,I find the site is slow to load.  It seems the advertising has to load first before I am able to scroll.  Not a big issue just thought I should mention it.
950401,OhioFisherman,2015-12-23 23:41:00,6623,"I had a problem with the site earlier today also, but the next time I tried, about 5 minutes later, all was good."
