950582,adempsey,2015-12-25 03:26:00,1498,"Anyone trying to sell you some product for detox etc.. is likely full of crap.  Don't believe any of it.   There is no real science to back up any claims by ""nutraceuticals"" because they don't require it.    Sure, some of it may do some of what they claim, but I'd say the vast majority is hogwash.  Just use common sense.  Eat as natural as possible, exercise and drink a lot of water.   There is nothing else that needs to be done.   If you aren't able to get a reasonable variety of foods, especially vegetables and fruits, take a vitamin supplement."
949355,AKRISONER,2015-12-15 16:58:00,5558,"anything pre-made is bad...  go to a grocery store, anything that is cooked, packaged or made on site is bad for you. Avoid carbohydrates after 1pm. this includes fruits.  Chicken breasts...fish....and all of the green vegetables you want. Eat fruit too but avoid eating it late in the day. Aside from that if you stick to that your body will detoxify the heck out of itself.  Drink 8 glasses of water a day at a bare minimum. Its not hard to conceptualize, but difficult to stick to."
949357,SirCranksalot,2015-12-15 17:14:00,3291,"Imagine your body like you are living in a lot cabin in the heart of Ontario with no electricity and at the centre is the wood stove (or your stomach).  As soon as you wake up you want to get the fire started. But if you try with a log, it won't work. Kindling and newspaper (don't know where you get newspaper in the bush, bear with me). So that's fruits, veggies, something light no later then 30 minutes when you wake up.  Now you want to keep that fire hot. Don't want it going out on you and having to light it again and you don't want to smother it. So lots of small pieces of wood throughout the day (veggies, lean meats, fish but not big meals). As the day gets longer you don't want a heavy fire burning before bed so, in the evening hold back from putting too much wood on the fire (not big meals in the evening).  Should work really well. Cranks your metabolism to the max.  Don't intend to do 'detox' but Ill use those tips the next time I start a fire! Thank you!"

949454,sleepjigging,2015-12-16 03:21:00,207,"Huzzsaba, I commend you for wanting to get healthier.  I will share what I teach my clients who want to loose weight: There are 3 parts to detox: 1. Pre-detox - getting ready by getting rid of the junk around you. Not just what you ingest. Everything that you think is bad can go. 2. Detox. There should be only good stuff in and around you. Maintain for 3 weeks. 3. MOST IMPORTANT: What is the permanent state that you want to achieve after detox? Don't go back to the bad ways.  Try to form new good habits. After detox you will be ready to have a cleaner way of living. Go with your new found tastes.   Canada food guide is a great place to start for eating habits.  The Canada food guide has caused a lot of weight problems because 1. It was designed for another era. 2. People don't know how to use the guide properly.   This diet is the one put out by Dr Poon as well. He's the guy that called Bernstein a quack.  There is a lot of good advice out there. It all boils down to eating less bad stuff (processed), and more good stuff (fruits/veggies).  As long as you are honest to yourself about what is good and bad, you will get healthier.

949522,mepps,2015-12-16 18:56:00,1301,I'm 35 I've spent the last 2 years really working hard on being healthy and trying to undo the damage caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. I've read a ton on the subject and found that everyone has their own ideas and someone elses solution wont always work for you. Spend a month at a time trying different things and see what works for your body and lifestyle.  My biggest tip - drink as much water as you can!  I aim for 3-4 litres a day and I feel more energetic and healthy than I ever have!

Bain TLS Weight Loss Coach   Thanks for all the replies.  I have been struggling with weight for a long time.  I lost 100lbs one year but we all know that's probably the worst thing to do.  I'm not too bad right now most people think I'm around 180-190 but I'm slightly over that.  I try everyday to eat healthy and have been able to maintain my weight but would like lose another 30 lbs and keep it off long term. I do find that drinking lots of water helps.  I have to be honest I haven't read every post here yet, but I will read them all and follow the best of recommendations.  Thanks"
949543,aplumma,2015-12-16 21:42:00,6896,The simple formula is this burn more calories than you take in. If you plan on eating something that is loaded with calories then you exercise before your splurge on calories. Some bodies are comfortable on 2000 calories per day other need more. it really depends on how active you are. The easiest thing to do is to drink a large glass of water before you eat the first bite of any meal. This gives you less room to fill and it also will help digest food properly.   Art

I've always been a walker but now I try and do 3 miles every day where before it was only a couple times a week.  We're on a dirt road 1.5 miles from the hiway with almost no traffic so it's a great place to walk. It's tough walking in the winter though as it's usually very slippery but there's a gym in Youngs Point just a couple miles south of here so we'll be going there thru the slippery months.  And I can absolutely guarantee I'll never be over weight again.

Watch your carb intake, do a blood test for cholesterol and triglyceride levels, ( fats in your blood ). No Smoking, that's a no brainer.

What this does is help to ease your dependance on processed sugar which is highly addictive. Your liver takes a beating helping to process a lot of sugar as does your pancreas. Needless to say, if you can do this for 3 weeks, you will lose weight and feel much better. This diet/detox (which is really just a diet) is one that a good friend of mine who is one of the grandaddies of naturopathic medicine, gave to me when I was battling cancer. So, no fruit, no grains, no onions, carrots, potatoes, red peppers, brussel sprouts... these are high in sugars. Lots of kale, spinach, lettuce, chard and the like. Lemon is very good, it helps the liver and kidneys (coming from one of the top nephrologists in T.O.). No processed meats and very little salt. This diet is the one put out by Dr Poon as well.
