949660,Acountdeleted,2015-12-17 19:05:00,2562,Oh yeah! Hmmmmm.......
949668,wormdunker,2015-12-17 19:52:00,1711,Dara - Harte Mine.  We travel north from White River on the highway which goes to Horne Payne approximately 35 km then onto the mine rd. (Goat Path) for approximately 20 minutes.  It's in the middle of nowhere!
949673,Dara,2015-12-17 20:11:00,3052,"Thats not the middle,,,edge maybe  Never heard of that one..we do a bit of work for the mines up there"
949739,NAW,2015-12-18 04:29:00,4022,Pickle Lake / Central Patricia used to be my stomping ground.  Mayne I should go hunt for safe ice there!!  This season is killing me.  I'm craving crappies!!!
949524,jedimaster,2015-12-16 19:18:00,3472,Ok so whats the furthest south for ice? I have no idea why but I kinda want to go this weekend.
949526,Sinker,2015-12-16 19:54:00,8692,Thunder bay maybe? Your looking at a loooong drive to drill a hole. Just take the boat out!  S.
949528,jimmer,2015-12-16 20:14:00,2730,You can always look in your glass at the floating cubes. Sorry I couldn't resist. Sinker has some great advice.
949531,jedimaster,2015-12-16 20:34:00,3472,Kinda feel like a drive.
949536,irishfield,2015-12-16 20:57:00,26272,Still boating on Temagami..
949537,Fisherman,2015-12-16 20:58:00,7201,"Cheap heating,  it could be worse."
949539,Dutch01,2015-12-16 21:02:00,1431,"When does ice ""usually"" form up there?"
949541,Dara,2015-12-16 21:24:00,3052,"In the Sault area we can almost always fish for Jan and some years sooner. Snow trails were groomed and open Dec 5 last year.  I am seriously considering taking the boat this weekend and we will not be on any ice for Jan 1 no way no how. I don't even think there is a chance of going to Wawa for ice this year.  My daughter has 14"" of ice but that is a really long drive"
949542,Dutch01,2015-12-16 21:38:00,1431,"Well, looks were all screwed down here then. I'm not driving 15-20 hours for ice!"
949548,irishfield,2015-12-16 22:18:00,26272,Dutch I've driven my truck to the dock on December 14th before. Two years ago Leah and I drove out on New Years Eve with the 6500 lbs of enclosed trailer behind the truck.
949553,Acountdeleted,2015-12-16 22:30:00,2562,I can't believe it. Usually January 6th is my go to day for cooks. Might have to bump that back a month.  Last year was Christmas Eve for the first time I was out. The year before that I think Chad and I were out around the 20th. No chance for either of those this year.
949554,aplumma,2015-12-16 22:34:00,6896,I have 3 inches of ice but it is in my whiskey.....   Art
949569,kuhaman,2015-12-16 23:16:00,503,Was in Westree until yesterday and there is zero ice on the lake we are on
949570,Lunkerhunter,2015-12-16 23:27:00,455,I was on simcoe today for perch in a boat. Water temps were 41-44 degrees.  Was fun being all alone on simcoe smashing jumbos. Haha
949572,Joeytier,2015-12-16 23:34:00,3990,You'd have to drive to Kirkland Lake/Iroqois Falls area just to find barely walkable ice on tiny lakes.
949589,wormdunker,2015-12-17 01:39:00,1711,Right now I'm on a job at a new gold mine 55 km north of White River.  No ice except in my drink!  I drove up from Sudbury on this past Monday in pouring rain +9 C!!  It started to snow 20 km north of Wawa.  Tomorrow +1 in White River!
949590,Sinker,2015-12-17 01:51:00,8692,"I don't mind a good road trip, but I draw the line at about 12 hrs and that's just not gonna do it.  S."
949593,bigugli,2015-12-17 04:17:00,6138,I was on simcoe today for perch in a boat. Water temps were 41-44 degrees.  Was fun being all alone on simcoe smashing jumbos. Haha I've been out in the boat as late as Dec. 23rd. on Simcoe
949595,OhioFisherman,2015-12-17 05:47:00,6623,"No ice here in the tropical Medina area, and from the looks of thing none soon!  http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/l/44253"
949596,Joey,2015-12-17 05:48:00,9122,"January 1st, 2008  joeycarp 010 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr  Why am I paying monthly snowmobile insurance from Jan to Dec each year I question myself every year, for maybe a month or two of ice fishing!!!"
949611,Dara,2015-12-17 14:03:00,3052,What mine is that...we are working on the new power plants 55km back NW of White river
949620,highdrifter,2015-12-17 14:46:00,2534,Cochrane has ice... I've got a buddy heading up there today.  I'm gonna wait till after the holidays mind you..  A quick warm snap up there and she won't be safe to walk on.
949643,LostAnotherOne,2015-12-17 17:06:00,956,I wouldn't be surprised to hear in the news that somewhere somebody's fell through the ice.  This is a very dangerous time with guys wanting to stare down a deep dark hole.
949646,Acountdeleted,2015-12-17 17:10:00,2562,"Figures, I get 10 paid days off for the first time in my life and there is nowhere to go..... Maybe I have to unpack the 'Yak'"
949652,Joeytier,2015-12-17 17:28:00,3990,"There's ice in cochrane/kap/hearst areas, only 8 hours away.  Didn't you drive drive all the way to Longlac by yourself one year just to fish for a day or two?  Cochrane is nothing!"
