For those who don't really want the product or necessarily have any money to their name, but would still like to know anonymously if products are still for sale. Now you can follow an item, without having the annoying responses from the seller asking 'are you still interested'?  I may add a second section dedicated to the 'lowest price i'll accept', for those have very little to do during the day, but have a burning desire to know what someone's base price is.   What do you guys think??? Big money in my future?"
949606,FloatnFly,2015-12-17 13:09:00,1640,"I would say that it would be nearly impossible, for these 2 reasons,  1: that would require the seller to be proactive on their ad, and actually take it down when the item sells  2: the sellers lowest price isn't what they think it is, negotiations are different with everyone"
949608,cuzza,2015-12-17 13:26:00,467,"Could you add a section to track the people who say ""on my way over now"" but never show up? I'm sure their families would appreciate the closure"

949681,HTHM,2015-12-17 20:53:00,4082,Kijiji already had an app for that.

949702,ccmtcanada,2015-12-17 23:32:00,7971,You already can create a watchlist on kijiji.  All the ads you're interested in are in one place.  You don't need to contact the buyer unless you want to make an offer.  When the poster removes the item it disappears from the list.

Figured something like that - you forgot to put the option in for them to overpay you, then you ship them the stuff and send them the change ...  and have the original payment be a fraud so yer out the goods, the shipping and the ""change"".
