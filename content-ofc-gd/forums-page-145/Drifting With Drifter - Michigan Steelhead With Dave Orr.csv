948983,solopaddler,2015-12-13 13:38:00,8605,"As most of you guys know Dave is down from Yellowknife for the month of December for a visit. Long before he moved north we fished a lot of steelhead together here in the Great Lakes region so it really was nice to share a drift with him again. It's been five years since the last time which frankly blows my mind. The older you get the faster time seems to fly by...  In any case being blessed with mild weather we decided to make the long run to Michigan to fish the Manistee for a couple of days. It's a compelling river, large and challenging. Every fish hooked is hard earned and memorable, it really is steelhead fishing at its finest at least imo.  While we didn't set the world on fire we caught fish consistently and guess what? Dave and I were the ONLY two anglers fishing a long stretch of prime river! It doesn't get any better than that!!  Here's a handful of shots including a couple of Dave hard at work in his office. There will be more updates throughout December, this was just a start.                   "

948999,Rod Caster,2015-12-13 15:18:00,5784,You sure lucked out on the weather! Looks like one hell of a spot.
949001,fishermccann,2015-12-13 15:23:00,655,Beautiful shots.
949010,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-13 16:31:00,10439,"T'was a good couple of days Mike. Nice to have the place to ourselves too. We'll have to get out again, on Thursday!!!! I have a few pics that I need to post up as well, but it will have to wait until later today."
949016,leaf4,2015-12-13 17:04:00,2466,Nice day! (s)
949034,misfish,2015-12-13 18:01:00,29133,You made the right choice there guys. Those are some nice long fish there. Well done.
949049,ketchenany,2015-12-13 20:06:00,3229,"Mike, one of these days, not in my lifetime, you will post and say you got 'skunked'  Nice fish! Welcome home Dave. Just like Florida this year lol"
949050,davey buoy,2015-12-13 20:16:00,5505,Good going guys !!!!!!!!!!! Nice fish !!!!!
949051,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-13 20:18:00,10439,Nice fish! Welcome home Dave. Just like Florida this year lol  Except for the distinct lack of salty water to fish in.
949071,GBW,2015-12-13 22:33:00,8460,Nice outing and fish for sure!
949082,solopaddler,2015-12-13 23:14:00,8605,"Thanks guys! For me (and Dave as well) this was more about just getting out, the fish are just a bonus. I've been so busy all fall I've barely fished steelhead at all and it's been killing me!     Nice bows!, always good to be alone on the water! Being by ourselves was the best part!  You sure lucked out on the weather! Looks like one hell of a spot. Yes on both counts! That river is really something special.  You made the right choice there guys. Those are some nice long fish there. Well done. Here's hoping there's still a chance to hook up.  Mike, one of these days, not in my lifetime, you will post and say you got 'skunked' NEVER!!!"
949097,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-14 00:19:00,10439,Looking forward to this weeks adventure Mike. It'll be about catching boat loads this week.
949103,dave524,2015-12-14 01:05:00,4508,"Nice bows, if I was that way I'd spend a day or two trying to hook up with some of them big Seeforellen strain browns."
949140,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-14 03:52:00,10439,Here's a few of my pics from the trip.              
949143,chris.brock,2015-12-14 04:06:00,4053,"Very cool guys, keep the reports and pics going if you don't mind.  Fish+ no people= I like!"
949151,solopaddler,2015-12-14 12:20:00,8605,"Very cool guys, keep the reports and pics going if you don't mind.  Fish+ no people= I like!  You would have liked this for sure!"
949152,Steelheadphycho,2015-12-14 12:35:00,470,Absolute jealousy!  Nice work gentleman!  Salivating for the next report!
949156,RDR,2015-12-14 13:40:00,125,"Looks like the ""Sawdust and Suicide"" show on the Manistee   Beauty river and great fish boys!  Nice pics and thanks for rubbing it in.....   LOL  Welcome back Dave! Looking forward to seeing your next adventure...."
949461,tomkat,2015-12-16 04:08:00,246,Those look a lot bigger than the ones I catch in the Credit or the ones I see other guys catch. Any reason for that?
949486,dave524,2015-12-16 14:28:00,4508,"Those look a lot bigger than the ones I catch in the Credit or the ones I see other guys catch. Any reason for that?  My experience has been bigger water = bigger fish.  Fishing the Niagara River all winter you will see a number of mid teen fish with the occasional  bigger one, then while fishing the Ganny or the Credit in the spring you get good numbers of cookie cutter 5 pounders. Same Lake."
949513,misfish,2015-12-16 16:41:00,29133,I love the way the water and structure looks. Been fishing sand and mud bottoms to long.LOL
949534,highdrifter,2015-12-16 20:54:00,2534,Sweet pics!!  Dave must be a close friend of yours..  You've never taken me somewhere that nice..  LOL
