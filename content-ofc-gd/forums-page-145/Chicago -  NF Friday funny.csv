The guy was an emotional wreck, pale, hands shaking in fear.""What's the matter, afraid of flying?"" Bob asked.""No, it's not that. I've  been transferred to Chicago . The people are crazy there, right? Lots of shootings, gangs, race riots, drugs, poor schools, and the highest crime rate in the nation."" Bob replied, ""I've lived in Chicago all my life. It's not as bad as the media says. Find a nice home, go to work, mind your own business, and enroll your kids in a nice private school. I've worked there for 14 years and never had the slightest trouble."" The guy relaxed and stopped shaking and said, ""Oh, thank you. I've been worried to death, but if you've lived and worked there all those years and say it's OK, I'll take your word for it. What do you do for a living?""  ""I'm a tail gunner on a Budweiser truck.""  HH       "
