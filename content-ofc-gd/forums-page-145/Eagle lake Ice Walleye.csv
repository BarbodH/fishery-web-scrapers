949582,manitoubass2,2015-12-17 00:28:00,11391,"Lil sawbill just gets hammered. But the fish tend to be a tad bigger, but way harder to locate"
949583,limeyangler,2015-12-17 00:32:00,5204,"Lil sawbill just gets hammered. But the fish tend to be a tad bigger, but way harder to locate   so which one is better?"
949584,manitoubass2,2015-12-17 00:43:00,11391,Imo big. No pressure and lotsa fish. Doesnt hurt we have a camp and fish house there?
949588,wormdunker,2015-12-17 01:33:00,1711,Your video is awesome!  Sadly we fisherman in the south are just drooling to get on some safe ice.  Is it going to happen & when?
949602,limeyangler,2015-12-17 12:06:00,5204,"Imo big. No pressure and lotsa fish. Doesnt hurt we have a camp and fish house there  Big sawbill looks easier to get onto too  What about Saturday? Do you know the ice conditions? I had to drive to Sioux Lookout yesterday, all the big water was WIDE OPEN here."

949240,limeyangler,2015-12-14 23:00:00,5204,"Hi all,  Got out with my buddy Tyler for a session on Eagle Lake. A good 6"" of ice all the way across the narrows. Depth from 16' to 22'. Biggest came from 22' but as the light faded the shallower holes saw all the action, iced quite a few, put some back and kept some for supper. glow orange 3/8Oz jigs with live minnows. Good to be out there….just need some snow now so I can get to my Crappie spot.   "
