949949,NAW,2015-12-20 14:47:00,4022,"I spent some time last week with my son, tearing apart 2 old broken GTs.  We managed to build on good working one.  He's been patiently waiting for the snow.  I saw on the radar that port Severn area and North where getting some snow yesterday.  Anyone up that way care to share a snow report??  It would save me a couple hours of driving and potentially a lot of disappointment for the young lad.."

Lindsay is all green right now.  *edit to add* at my age I should know better to not try tricks but I never learn. More so at a family property where there is a mini half pipe to play in going down the hills...
