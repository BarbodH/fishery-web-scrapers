My best so far was a montons pale ale, with some medium spray malt some extra sugar and dry hopped with 1 oz of cascade ,    Tastes  identical to Muskoka  breweries detour.    I want to get into all grain brewing in the spring.    Also if any one has a vintage fridge around I'm looking to convert one into a keg fridge. Also looking for some ""soda kegs"" or ball lock kegs"
949836,fishing n autograph,2015-12-19 02:36:00,2540,I haven't tried beer but I just bottled 36 litres of wine and about 15 or so gallons of hard cider this year with another 11 gallons aging in carboys.
949837,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-19 03:05:00,10439,I'm drinking some of my home brew right now.
949838,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-19 03:07:00,8243,"I have helped my Dad make copious barrels of wine for around 50 years until he and all the Compare found out a 20 liter pale cam miraculously become good vino on the ride home for cheap. We tried the Beer thing only once. When we opened the first bottle it smelled like a Skunk went off and my Ma could smell it one floor up immediately and made us take the entire batch out of her home.  The oldtimers 2 golden rules.  1) Never let a woman near the wine when it is fermenting that is, has recently or will be menstruating soon. 2) See rule 1.  I don't know if it applies to beer as well but I would heed those words as there probably has some scientific merit. There are many other rules that I have heard discussed calmly with much diplomacy in those 5 decades in as far as a dozen old timers from the boot are able to. I do remember gunshots once but they were only warning shots. That was over Full Moons vs. Crescent Moons during the harvest of the Grape."
949858,dave524,2015-12-19 12:53:00,4508,"I learned as a grunt labourer helping dad lift 12 gal carboys when he was racking and bottling his wine. Never did wine on my own but did beer for quite a few years. Always used the Brew Canada Kits and had a 12 gal primary fermenter, that would be 2 kits as a single batch. As I recall I would do 5-7 days in the primary fermenter and then rack it off into 2 X 23 litre  carboys for 2-3 weeks before bottling.  Some guys did not do the 2 stage beer making, I much preferred my beer to theirs."
949862,ketchenany,2015-12-19 13:33:00,3229,"Been making my own wine for 40 years, never tried beer. I into blending juices for colour and taste."
949866,Rod Caster,2015-12-19 14:05:00,5784,"I intent to grow some hops in the next few years and see if I can supply a local brewer. Maybe I'll get into home brewing at that time.  Muskoka Detour is pretty good, not a bad beer to model your own against."

949878,KLINKER,2015-12-19 15:57:00,256,"I put down 180 bottles of wine in 013 and good thing I did because we haven't had grapes since. My grapes are table or jelly grape so the wine has a grape taste not ready for  VQA.  I did strawberry wine, it was awful.  The big black raspberries turned out very sweet so I blend it with the grape wine. And I do an elderberry wine. Elderberry wine is usually a grape wine flavored with a few dried elderberries but I do it with a few lbs of berries same as i would grapes. It turns out awfully strong taste but it is the cure for the common cold.  Due to no grapes for the last 2 years its time to make beer if I ever get around to it. My bud says the problem with making beer is you drink a lot of beer."

I intent to grow some hops in the next few years and see if I can supply a local brewer. Maybe I'll get into home brewing at that time.  Muskoka Detour is pretty good, not a bad beer to model your own against. thats cool, are they hard to grow?   yea i love a slightly hopped beer not a huge fan of the doubble ipa""s and stuff"
949946,Rod Caster,2015-12-20 13:34:00,5784,"I don't think they are overly difficult to grow, but they like to grow vertically (like vines), so I would need the infrastructure."

950150,scuro2,2015-12-22 04:35:00,904,Never drank a homebrew worth making and plenty have tried to impress me with their concoctions.
950477,Zamboni,2015-12-24 17:13:00,235,"Many people call the brew on premises places homebrew scuro2...or Mr Beer kits etc. Probably that's what you've been exposed to, or you simply prefer a Budweiser or a Molson Canadian over a craft beer? If you do enjoy a craft beer, from a hoppy beer such as Mad Tom to a high end Stout like Kate the Great then all these high end beers can be made at home by a decent AG brewer. I make a Pliny the Elder clone people try to buy after tasting....and a porter that has won awards."

The yeast sediment at the bottom of every bottle makes me want to vomit. He finally bought a keg setup and is in the process of learning to use it..Cant wait to try it..
