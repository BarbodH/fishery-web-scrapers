Except for their catch phrase which is also on their trucks.  'If it arrives on time, it's a FLUKE'.  ........ Not sure they thought this one out."

Fluke Transport has been around for a long time in Hamilton.. Started out as 1 truck then slowly built up to what they are now... still small but into a lot of Storage and Wharehousing... Did a lot of work for Proctor and Gamble (P&G) before they got big and moved to Brantford.  Their slogen is catchy though"

950304,Steelheadphycho,2015-12-23 04:23:00,470,LOL! Brilliant!
950308,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-23 06:17:00,8243,"Fluke Transport was and may still be Ron Foxcroft of Hamilton. He is a world renowned Basketball ref and his son now refs in the CFL. He is the inventor of the Fox 40 whistle, used by every pro sport in the world where a whistle is used. From FIFA to the NFL. Any ref that is serious uses the Fox 40 whistle. That's a lot o whistles$$$$. The company now has a huge line of products. That plastic safety kit you may have bought for the boat is a Fox product.  The motto for Fluke was no fluke, it was well thought out and won many awards that advertising and marketing companies give each other.  The plumber butt on the toilet is the best in a long time, beyond brilliant."
