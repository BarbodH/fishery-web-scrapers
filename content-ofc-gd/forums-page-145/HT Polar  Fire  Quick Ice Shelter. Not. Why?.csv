Why make something that has no anchor tie downs, why make it so it can be blown over when you are in it? There is no areo to this. I can see this only for a day on the hard water when the forecast is , no wind. Im sure a couple of hundred bucks, could be better spent , then on this death trap.  One hole,one heater. Wind blows you over and you got, one heater,that is not your friend.  If you own, or thinking of one, think about it.  I for one,would never have this.  Im only posting as a safety look at this.  B"

950131,crappieperchhunter,2015-12-22 02:17:00,2582,Because HT products are complete garbage. That has been my experience with the few things I have purchased. Something would really have to change for me to even look at anything made by them.
950142,Joeytier,2015-12-22 03:45:00,3990,"Although I will say,  I do really like their 'rigger' tip-ups, I would never even consider a product like a portable hut with their name on it."
950330,Terry,2015-12-23 14:28:00,14456,When it's windy it will be portable.    Or trolling. Down the lake
950331,Roy,2015-12-23 14:41:00,13728,"So which is the good one, Brian?"
950337,misfish,2015-12-23 16:28:00,29133,"The pop hubs and flips. They are aero for the wind. They can be banked and anchored. Some guys don't anchor or bank their flips. They do on occasion, get flipped ( extream windy days). Right bud?  :whistling:  This fire quick is a base floor. Unlike the hubs and the flips. So your heater and other stuff in on the ice. If something were to let go and flip or blow away, the heater and you are not going to be trapped.  Im not targeting the maker here, just the design."
