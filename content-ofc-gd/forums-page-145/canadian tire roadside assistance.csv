950346,Oggie,2015-12-23 18:09:00,588,I had CAA in case I had trouble getting out of my camp road.  The camp/cottage road is about 2km long.  After a freezing rain event I called CAA to help me. I had an F150 with summer tires (yeah I know .... it was an early Nov rain).  CAA asked if my camp road is maintained by the municipality. I said no but it's gravel and flat except for this small hill.  SORRY! We (CAA) don't tow on unassumed roads unless you want to hire us as a private tow.  His advice ......find some sand in the bush and sand the hill.....we aren't coming to get you.  That's about the only time I could have used CAA and they don't cover that circumstance so no more renewals.
950379,huzzsaba,2015-12-23 21:19:00,884,The thing with CT is you may have to wait to get a tow from China. lol.
950424,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-24 01:50:00,10439, I was told my members of a 4x4 club to avoid metal hooks.  They can become dangerous projectiles when things go wrong.  They recommended a nylon strap with loops on both ends.  That's fine as long as one of the vehicles has a trailer hitch ball to hook the loop on. the other end has to be run around an axle and looped through before hooking on the hitch. Having a shackle gets rid of having to loop through.  I have just been using one of these for the last 5 years or so. http://www.princessauto.com/en/detail/7-8-in-x-14-ft-tow-rope/A-p8020429e I really need to get a better one but I hve managed to pull a stuck Suburban out of the sand in Alaska using it and my wee Honda to pull the guy out.
950234,KLINKER,2015-12-22 18:58:00,256,"My friend called CAA when she had a car stuck in her driveway. They came from about 30 miles away and refused to pull the car out because the driveway wasn't plowed and the driveway can't get plowed till the car is gone. So I used those steel grates you get at CT and drove it out 3' at a time. Thought it odd that they would go that far and not do the job.  Many years ago I pulled an old fella out of a snowbank, I refused any payment and a good thing I did, cop that was there was just waiting to charge me for pulling him out."
950235,fishindevil,2015-12-22 19:11:00,6254,"So do it, but doing it on the side of the road at -20 in a blizzard sucks! Ask me how I know. Much nicer to sit in the warm truck and call CAA to put the trailer on a flatbed and take it to a heated shop to replace the hub....  S. your damn right ....... try that in mattawa 15 miles in on a logging road in -20  not gonna happen.....worth the money in a second"
950237,Sinker,2015-12-22 19:21:00,8692,Charge you with what?? I've helped a lot of people out of the ditch over the years. I didn't know it was an offence.  S.
950239,KLINKER,2015-12-22 19:28:00,256,"From what he told me if I was paid it would be towing without a license.  I'm not sure if it is legal to pull someone out of a snowbank, it denies the cops a chance to lay charges and if the guys drunk you might get in trouble."

950310,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-23 07:00:00,8243,"Wormdunker I'm not the one in the ditch, that would be the blond that lets me stay here. But I will never be as lucky as Wayne and his family only needed 1 tow after all those miles. I have never been in a ditch. well almost never.  Towing without a proper licence? Never, ever heard of that one. There has been more than a few times I have put a towbar on and pulled a car, truck and even a tractor behind me. All with temporary lighting that I have. I need to ask a fellow golfer that is in the local OPP detachment patrolling our highways and byways. If pulling someone out of a ditch is illegal it's a new one on me and ridiculous. When a construction crew pulled you know who out of a ditch last winter it was the OPP that had his lights on for any traffic while they did it."
950320,DanD,2015-12-23 11:46:00,2223,"If you take payment for towing whatever out of the ditch or down the road; then it's illegal. When a towing company is called out to retrieve a vehicle from a ditch; they must notify the police. The ditch is still part of the hwy and the hwy traffic act applies and charges can (most times not) be laid for things like careless, care and control, impaired; whatever the cop deems fit for that situation that got you in the ditch. I wouldn't want to be the good Samaritan with a tow chain hooked to someone's car and then when the cops show up they find that the driver is impaired or the car is stolen. Not sure what they could charge you with; but you'd have a hell of a lot of explaining to do. That being said, on a deserted road, I'd be one of the first to try and help someone out of the ditch; but on a well traveled hwy; the most I'll do is offer them a warm seat in my vehicle; while I call a tow truck.  Dan."
950321,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-23 12:33:00,8243,"That is logical Dan. A great explanation, that I get. There are more than a few guys out here that will drive around during big storms like Lake effects with straps and chains that will give you a pull and accept tips. They make some pretty good $$ at 30 to 50 bucks a pop, or more for city dwellers in little 2 door Hondas etc. with All Seasons on. I know a guy that does it with his backhoe but insists the owner hook up the straps. One can do a lot of damage if they don't know what they are doing. Nothing like hooking to a sway bar or the like to get a nice bill at the garage."
950322,lew,2015-12-23 12:51:00,12766,I was actually wandering around CTC yesterday and looked at some tow straps that I could maybe use if a friend or neighbor slid off a snowy country road and needed a pull out.  They had a couple 20 footers with hooks but they were only good for about 3300 pounds. Another I saw was 30' and good for something like 6000 lb. but was looped on either end and I figure I'd need more hardware to attach them and ended up not getting anything.
950323,DanD,2015-12-23 13:06:00,2223,"I know a guy that does it with his backhoe but insists the owner hook up the straps. One can do a lot of damage if they don't know what they are doing.

Had to have my 50 Chevy towed due to the 6 volt generator going for a crap. You do don't go far with a 6 volt battery, not being charged. Driver backs the flat bed up to the car, grabs the winch cable and J hooks and hooks to the car. I take a look and he has the J hooks, hooked to the steering tie rods. I tell him what he's done and he gets all pissed off, say he's been towing for 20 years and knows what he's doing. I tell him I've been a mechanic for 35 years and he's not winching my car using the tie rods. He sheepishly has a look and changes his hook points and didn't say another word too me on the trip back to London from Turkey Point.

950325,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-23 13:31:00,8243,"Dan I hear you. Some Insurance guy comes out here from the city to peruse the new to us property to give me a quote from Hamilton. He doesn't pull into the empty driveway he pulls onto the grass onto the other side of the laneway. The little 2 door front wheel drive sinks into the mud up to the wheel hubs. Time to leave and he as stuck as one can get. He says if you give me a push I can get out, never going to happen. He doesn't have CAA etc and neither do I. He uses my phone book to call for a tow. We are new here and have no clue whom to recommend. He calls a garage in Fisherville and 2 kids in an old pickup shows up. You know the 1/2 ton with mismatched fenders and door with the MT beer bottles and cans in the box, that mechanic.  His call. They hook him up after they dig the mud out by hand to get a bite on the rear axle and he hands them some cash. He pulls away and is back 5 minutes later. Theybasically pulled the rear axle entirely off the passengers side. I was really feeling for the guy until he starts beaking off to me because I didn't tell him not to park there. Now I want to slap him. But he wants to know who he called and from where? And now he needs to use our phone, he's flipping on me again because he can't get cell service, and that's my fault, how?  My wife took mercy on him and invited him in to use the phone and looks to see what fly by night garage he called. When he was leaving I said he could stick his insurance quote elsewhere.

I can understand charges when someone is going looking for tow jobs to earn some cash; but I don't think accepting an offer of cash from someone you happened upon is not quite the same.  I often accept gas money from people that I take out in my boat.  That is not the same as operating a charter service.  I offered to help pay for gas when I car pooled for a drive up to Simcoe last winter.   If he had accepted, that would not be the same as him operating an illegal taxi service.  I can understand charges if someone refused to pull him out unless he paid.  But, I think that accepting a voluntary token payment in appreciation for a favour is a whole lot different than operating and an unlicensed towing business."
950091,huzzsaba,2015-12-21 22:30:00,884,"I have been a loyal member of CAA but I'm getting a amazing deal (50% cheaper than CAA) with Canadian tire roadside assistance for almost the same amount of services.  I usually take the premier membership with CAA which includes 350kms for one of the 5 tows which is the only extra benefit I see at this point with CAA as compared to Canadian tire's Gold Package. I understand I probably won't get coverage in the US with Canadian Tire, but I usually rent a car anyways when going south of the border.  The deciding factor I guess is finding out if their service is good? I have never had problems with CAA and hoping I can get equally good reviews for Canadian Tire.  Thanks"

You have a point.  I guess it's kind of like insurance.  I have been towed a few times in the last 8 years of having CAA but have used it multiple times to help out friends and family.  So far, I feel it is worth it.  I once broke down in Ottawa and the closest place I could have gotten it towed was my dad's place in Montreal. Didnt cost me anything for a 200k tow.  I am paying $150 approx with CAA per year.  Canadian Tire Roadside assistance is $100 and they have a promotion with Options card that will knock off 30% of that.  Well worth it compared to $150+.

I wasn't going to do a 2 hour round trip to give her a boost or move the steering wheel to enable the car to start. I didn't care how much a year it was and it was only $100.00 for CAA. The new truck came with roadside assist and I have used them 3 times. 2 tires and a mysterious incident of lack of fuel. Good insurance to have. Getting the spare down in the truck is ridiculous, especially if the bolt isn't clean and exercised. No way a non mechanical individual with change a tire on that truck if never done before. I always wondered what that black tab on the bumper was for.

950162,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-22 05:51:00,8243,"Your right sir towing is included on my policy, for a premium but it is cheap. The CAA is around $100.00 for my wife. I have it on my Silverado until 180,000 K. so she is the only one on it. It has paid for itself since she has had it in the last 5or 6 years. Hopefully we won't use it again. It really gives me peace of mind and for me it's worth it. We are rural and have deadly lake effect storms here. In the past I had to depend on friends with 4X4's, backhoes, tractors as these ditches seem to be magnetized and because of the feeder creeks to the lake most are deep, very deep.. More than once a 4X4 wouldn't get the job done. I didn't have a 4X4 before she got CAA so it was 300 a pop to get her out (we call her a ditch magnet) so I would flip friends or locals with 8N's or a back hoe a few bucks to help them then I owed them a favour. I'm calculating in my head and I am ahead in $$ with CAA. Just this year we called twice for mechanical issues and she used it once for a friend, that's over $1000.00 alone for a little over 100 bucks. Can't get much for 100 beans today. And I'm thankful she has never hurt herself or anyone else. The OPP pulled her out once and a construction crew once. If it was me they would have found the body in the spring."
