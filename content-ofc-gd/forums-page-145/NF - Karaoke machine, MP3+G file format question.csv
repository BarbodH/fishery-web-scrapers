Regular MP3 files obviously just play with sound but no video, but this machine uses MP3+G files to play the music with the lyrics on the TV screen.  Does anyone know where to find music in this MP3+G format, or some sort of software converter do make them into this format? Youtube has all kinds of songs with lyrics on the screen, but the programs I have only convert the files into MPEG4 format which does not work on this machine.  Thanks - hoping someone here knows. Cheers Pete  "

949901,DaveRoach,2015-12-19 20:04:00,202,Does it also support cdg?
949914,Fisherpete,2015-12-19 23:18:00,1814,Yes it does. It came with a disc with around 700 songs in that format.
