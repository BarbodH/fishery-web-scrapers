Justice refers to ""just -us"" A total overhaul of the political system that makes the laws need to be done.  It doesn't matter what party is elected, the results are the same."
949757,LeXXington,2015-12-18 14:48:00,1928,"Where do you get this ""WE"" stuff  Just the govt workers that heard they may lose their job did it..apparently there is enough of them  Just a few more Govt Workers and we can change Ontario to a Communist state. System of social organization in which all economic and social activity is controlled by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self-perpetuating political party.   The Crown prosecutes the people charged in the Gas plant theft.  The people charged worked for the government when the crime allegedly took place. The crime will be argued they were doing what was required for the job.  We pay for the Crown lawyers to prosecute \ we pay for the lawyers of the people charged == Screwed twice again on the same gas plant. The Duffy trial has cost so much more than he allegedly stole.. and yet we pay for it all"

949877,lookinforwalleye,2015-12-19 15:44:00,4399, Stop voting lieberal Exactly Lew....we still have a corrupt Liberal government in Ontario and SOMEBODY went and voted in a Liberal federally....  :wallbash:

949631,John Bacon,2015-12-17 16:01:00,3277,Better late than never...  Hopefully they can bring McGuinty and Wynne down with them.  http://www.cp24.com/news/opp-charge-two-former-mcguinty-staffers-in-connection-with-gas-plants-scandal-1.2704173
949632,lew,2015-12-17 16:06:00,12766,Nice to see charges laid but more than likely they'll just receive the same slap on the wrist that Duffy will probably get.
949635,Dara,2015-12-17 16:34:00,3052,Maybe its just me but there sure seems to be a lot of police investigations and criminal charges associated with this government
949636,AKRISONER,2015-12-17 16:38:00,5558,"and we voted these clowns back into power the next election...do some quick math and you can figure out fairly quickly that these guys straight up stole 250 bucks from every single tax payer in Ontario outright.

949642,fishindevil,2015-12-17 17:00:00,6254,now to charge mguinty and wynnebag and it would be awesome .......  they have stole millions
949651,bigugli,2015-12-17 17:24:00,6138,"Now if they are going to lay charges, they better be going after at least 1/2 of the politicians over the past 20 years. Once you find one rotten fish in the barrel, you're pretty much sure to find the whole barrel has gone rancid."

949662,Cast-Away,2015-12-17 19:27:00,790,"The E Health scandal is more of a piss off than this one in my opinion given the state of how the healthcare industry services us taxpayers. They threw away almost $1 billion dollars and got zero return after forcing all doctors to upgrade their own computer systems and spend countless hours keying in patient data for nothing. Go in to any hospital and ask them to look at your history and they all have the same answer. ""There is none outside of our own records"".  Completely shameful that this could happen when the government could have purchased an off the shelf software package from any big computer software company and customized it to suit our needs and get our complete health history at the click of a mouse. Instead the tried to start from scratch with what?"
949664,lew,2015-12-17 19:42:00,12766,I think the worst part of all is the fact that some of you people still voted this disgraceful party back into power for yet another thieving term.  At least I can sleep well at night knowing that I did my part to try and get rid of them.  It amazes me how so many voted them back into power yet all we hear is people complaining about how terrible they are.
949672,Dutch01,2015-12-17 20:07:00,1431,I didn't vote for them so I feel free to complain!

949678,craigdritchie,2015-12-17 20:38:00,1586,Arresting these people is a good start. But it is McGuilty who belongs in jail.
949680,Dara,2015-12-17 20:51:00,3052,I saw a bit of an interview with McGuinty a couple weeks ago and he is quite proud of his record as a Premier

949711,ketchenany,2015-12-18 00:16:00,3229,"Just paperwork Lew. It will amount to nothing! Somehow one of the ""other parties"" got my email and anytime something happens I get and email and they always ask for a ""donation"" after they give me their views. So far they have done nothing they said they would do. Take the money out of your expense accounts and hefty paycheck if you need something. A majority Gov has free reign on what they will do, these will get good paying jobs after they are ""cleared"".  Duffy needed a personal trainer and a makeup artist, just sayin  .. ."

Wynne was more suprised that anybody when she pulled it off  The attrition part came after the fact, when the tough guy part backfired on him. If Hudak hadn't done that, I think he would've easily won.  Stole defeat from the jaws of victory."
