949594,Bondar,2015-12-17 04:20:00,817,I picked up a BNIB Elite 7 chirp today off Kijiji for what I think was a great deal. As with everything it has some good and bad reviews. I bought it for the bow of my boat to run through the terrova.  Anyone have some hands on experience with these units? Was planning on making it portable as well.
