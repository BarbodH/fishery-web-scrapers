It dawned on me that my usual routine is to winterize the live wells and power washer pump, change the oils etc in both engines when I bring the boat home from Temagami in late September and then Musky fish a few times in the Fall before putting her away to splash the fresh oils around. Of course I did that in October 2014 and then the boat never moved until this Falls Musky hunt. I popped the cowling to read what the engine time was last round ( I write in sharpie on the side of the case) to find that we put 96 hours on the Verado this fall trolling for 'skis, so instead of blocking I decided it best to do the old $140 oil / filter change so she's ready for Spring. Guess I'll block it tomorrow.."
949689,mike rousseau,2015-12-17 21:50:00,4661,96 hours of trolling is a lot of miles on your baits... Good for you getting out that much

Gives my mind a new path to follow.  Yesterday, exact same time (3:50), during the Major, and my Plow disappeared with a snap in open water. Always check for frays... we'll never know how big it was, but it's wearing expensive jewelry unfortunately."

Good luck and all the best...glad to here you are coping well and hanging in!  Cheers!
945220,chris.brock,2015-11-18 04:57:00,4053,I've never been to g bay in my life...  That's probably why you can't relate.   I could do 150 hours and be on the edge of my seat the whole time.

Naa,as good or better within 30 mins of where Mike and I are.  No 150 hrs per fish here or the biggies wouldnt have people to chase them. Everyone gets lucky tho' no matter where you are. Right pass with a bait being presented properly just puts the odds in your favour a little bit. The rest is up to a dumb fish."
945225,mike rousseau,2015-11-18 05:38:00,4661,It's not that I can't relate... That's not what I'm saying at all...  I'm saying if I went that long on a water body without a fish I woulda quit and spent my time elsewhere... Irish is just way more patient then me...  Example... The Ottawa river... Can't catch a fish there... Been up there 3 times for around 30-36 hours total.... No fish boated... I've had follows... I've had hits... I'm fishing the same structure as everyone else... Just can't seal the deal... The only reason I go is because it's a shollow water fishery with great casting opportunities... Now that I've done better casting on the st lawrence this year I'm not sure if I'll ever go back to the Ottawa...

I would guess it's better, I see Mike's fish pics. Not doubting that.  None of us are on the same page here. I can't speak for Wayne, but there's something special about G Bay and the French and it can cough up giants. Just the exposed Canadian shield in the background in that picture gets my heart going. This probably makes no sense to you guys."
945227,mike rousseau,2015-11-18 05:56:00,4661,It depends what your after...  Not exactly a romantic scenery everywhere on the st lawrence river...  And it's a very busy waterway...  Ships going by every hour or so...  I bet g bay is a really nice getaway... And nobody can argue there are giants there...
945231,lew,2015-11-18 08:34:00,12766,"Just the exposed Canadian shield in the background in that picture gets my heart going. This probably makes no sense to you guys.  I'm agreeing with you 110% on the scenery Chris, it makes a huge difference on a fishing trip. I spend alot of time fishing muskies on the West Arm of Nipissing and the place is gorgeous, very similar to parts of GBay & the French with the granite & pines. I've often said I could fish for a week and get skunked but still come home saying it was a fabulous trip.  Lake St. Clair puts up some huge fish but offers absolutely nothing in the way of scenery and to me that makes a huge difference in a trip.  Some nice fish but nothing to go with them."

He reeled it in, clipped the hooks etc but I get the picture, it's how we troll !!  Good one Wayne! Checked the solunar tables and lunar tables that day both were in your favour.

Personally I am still in the mentality that one day while tossing big baits for trophy pike a bigger ski is gonna cross paths with me.  Nice catch though! The cleanest skis come outta the bay thats for sure.

Part of the thing is that everyone on here thinks that G bay basically means moon river. Moon river seems to have the best fishing on the bay, especially for musky.  To those questioning the fishery on GBay...its one of the best i have fished, its also one of the most challenging due to size and exposure, its also probably one  of the most beautiful making every moment on it that much more worth it."
