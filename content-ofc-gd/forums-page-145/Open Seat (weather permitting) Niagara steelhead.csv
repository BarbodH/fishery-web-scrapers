950145,HTHM,2015-12-22 04:02:00,4082,"I was hoping to go out on the Niagara this coming Wednesday the 23'rd for some steelhead. I have the boat, but no idea what I am doing. If there is anyone who knows how to steelhead on the Niagara and is willing to some me the ropes, I would be happy to go out with you. I would be leaving from the Hamilton area. Let me know via PM."
950151,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-22 04:41:00,10439,I'm willing to bet the water is going to be too dirty to make it worthwhile HTHM.
950152,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-22 04:42:00,8243,"I would be careful Albert, that is some serious water there. My wife is from Queenston and has some tales of experienced boaters that thought they knew the river. I have been twice and won't go to far upriver again. Too squirrely for me. I caught a huge beauty Chrome in front of Art Park that turned out to be a Coho, experience is a lifetime of mistakes.  You sure are getting your moneys worth from the new rig, good on ya. I hope a local takes you up on the nice offer."
950154,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-22 04:46:00,8243,"I watched a show from a few years back when they were out in December. Less rain 3 years ago but similar temps. Cold enough for you yet up there DR. Calling for a balmy 14 Christmas Eve. That's just not right for the kids, send snow please. For me I want to see Palm trees sprouting on the Erie beach myself. I guess that would signal the World's end though, not good."
950157,bobkayla,2015-12-22 04:59:00,148,"You diffeniitly need a trolling motor,,bow mount ,,,,right now the river is mud ,,,usually takes a few days to clear as long as the winds stay down,,,,,hope it works out for you"
950215,Joey,2015-12-22 16:27:00,9122,"Ya, with the rain we have had, it's not worth your time.  We've fished Queenston alot and you will have zero visability right now.  Maybe you and Paul can go after it clears up a bit.  He knows the river and where to go."
950216,HTHM,2015-12-22 16:30:00,4082,That would be most excellent. Even better if you came along as well.
950227,Steve Piggott,2015-12-22 18:06:00,196,River was muddy yesterday.
950230,highdrifter,2015-12-22 18:17:00,2534,River was muddy yesterday.  That would have been my guess.  She'll need a week with no wind for sure..
950247,landry,2015-12-22 20:16:00,1005,Rain has nothing to do with it. The strong SW or W winds muddy up Erie and the river. U may be able to get out after Christmas. That's my plan/hope. The river is a safe place if u have common sense. Fish the backdraft right at the launch of go across to artpark. Be cautious of N winds at the mouth as it can make very big waves against the river current. Do you have a trolling motor and are you good with it?
950301,HTHM,2015-12-23 04:01:00,4082,"I have a bow mount, but I would say my skill level is average at best. I have all of next week open, perhaps a pre-GTG fish might be in order?"
950309,Old Ironmaker,2015-12-23 06:33:00,8243,I'm sure you can make a game plan with someone on Thursday. I have someone in mind Albert. He says he doesn't know what he is doing as well. He must be lucky because he catches fish well.
