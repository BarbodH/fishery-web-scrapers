949448,GBW,2015-12-16 02:03:00,8460,I try to help when and where I can. In this case a buddy Mike is looking after the bill for all the kids that get to enjoy fishing there.
949708,FloatnFly,2015-12-17 23:58:00,1640,"Im sure the kids will be more than happy, as will the councilors since they won't have to spend a ton of time untangling giant birds nests"
949712,manitoubass2,2015-12-18 00:22:00,11391,Awe I feel like an jerk.  I totally forgot to send the reels I have?  Sorry
949728,FloatnFly,2015-12-18 02:25:00,1640,"They can be sent anytime, like I told GBW, they won't be needed until the spring anyway when they have some warmer temps"

947815,FloatnFly,2015-12-04 00:07:00,1640,"Not sure if this is the right place, but here goes.  A friend of mine works with special needs kids, and takes them fishing for an hour a day, however, the reels they have available are very old, and the anti reverse is broken on them, so they spend over half the time untangling lines.  So, I am collecting reels to donate to them, personally I have 2 reels that will be going.  If any of you have any reels you no longer have a use for, that are collecting dust, in decent working order, and you like to donate them please let me know, I;ll be giving them to her parents to take up north to her.  Im in the Ajax/Whitby/Oshawa area"
947823,GBW,2015-12-04 00:33:00,8460,Ever make it to Lindsay? I have one I could spare (so to say)
947827,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-04 00:41:00,10439,I will be coming to Southern Ontario next week. I will look through my selection of reels as I know I could probably let 1/2 dozen or so go. We can make arrangements to maybe meet in Mississauga as I will be doing some business there a couple of days.

That would be a stretch for me to get there next week, only other way we could do that, is if there was a member out that way that would be willing to hold on to them until after Christmas.  Just so busy putting in extra hours at work to get Christmas orders together, its about a 1hr 30min dive for me, assuming traffic is fine :s   Ever make it to Lindsay? I have one I could spare (so to say)   I could, they aren't needed until spring/early summer anyway.  just getting this post up while people are putting gear away and thinking about they may or may not need anymore"

I'm sure there is someone that can step up for us. I will be in Southern Ontario until Jan 1 so I'm sure we can arrange something."
947859,GBW,2015-12-04 02:44:00,8460,"Dave and Rick, you both can send them to me and I'll give all to him on a weekend where I'm in Brooklin (North Whitby) when I pick up or drop off my kids. Your call guys."
947860,manitoubass2,2015-12-04 02:47:00,11391,Sounds great to me! Im sure I have at least 5 reels to donate. Ill start looking in the morning. Goeff txt me you address bud
947861,GBW,2015-12-04 02:50:00,8460,*edit* done
947863,GBW,2015-12-04 02:54:00,8460,"FloatnFly, any rod's needed? I may have one or two if needed too... I have to check the boathouse and so forth if so..."
947875,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-04 03:57:00,10439,"OK, I pulled a pile out of the herd!!! The Mitchell is missing the handle but you may be able to use one off the current worn out reels. Also one of the Shimano's is missing a spool but it can be used as a spare to the other 3 that are working. Three of the reels and the rod are as new. Should help out a bit I would think.  "

948049,GBW,2015-12-05 01:37:00,8460,So you know who David Chong is right? I spoke to a distributor today who he works with for the “Catch a Dream!” Kids Fishing Derby and they offered me to help you hook up the kids. How many rods and reels are needed and are they all spinning or do you need some spincast too? PM me when you can.

I do not know who David Chong is, but that is awesome,  Im  not sure how many are needed exactly, she just said anything to replace the broken ones would be appreciated.  I would think in the neighbourhood of a dozen would be good.  They have been using spinning reels, so to keep things easy, probably just spinning reels"
948067,DRIFTER_016,2015-12-05 03:17:00,10439,I guess you won't be needing mine then.
948071,GBW,2015-12-05 04:52:00,8460,Dave save yours for next time a local event can use them. I'll get this with my buddy who's the donating company.
948072,GBW,2015-12-05 04:53:00,8460,Spinning reels it is then... Got it. Check your PM

948757,Muskieman,2015-12-11 01:20:00,2472,"Eh ! I do this as a passtime , I started off with "" project free wheels "" in 2012 , managed to give away close to 500 bicycles in a couple of years , .. had a side interest with "" project free reel "" with the help of a few board Admins I've managed to give away about 200 rods and reels since 2014 , I'm no longer into bicycles , strictly rods and reels ( much easier to keep 500 rods and reels VS hundreds of bicycles ), I refurbish them and give them away to local organizations/ shelters /provincial parks, libraries and Cops and COs who can hand them out . I'm just about ready to give away about 125 units , I should be done by early February ... drop me a line and I'll hook you up .  KCCO."
949440,GBW,2015-12-16 00:46:00,8460,"I got your PM but you forgot to tell me who to address the shipping to (name of the person expecting the gear is?)  I have 15 spinning combo's on order for the kids. Thanks to a buddy he's picking up the whole tab.  Mod's, can I post the donating companies name?"
949445,FloatnFly,2015-12-16 01:24:00,1640,"Thanks again GBW, going to make a bunch of kids very happy for years"
