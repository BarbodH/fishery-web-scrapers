628049,mike rousseau,2011-10-05 16:00:00,4661,"well... had a great day yesterday... for numbers of fish anyways...  i had planned on drifting live bait for musky... but the wind direction would have made this difficult... so i started trolling cranks... seeing as the water temps are dropping... i figured id slow down a bit... apparently a mistake... after 1-2 hours without a fish... i decided to bump up the speed from 3.5-4mph to 5-6mph...  30 seconds later the clicker was doing its job... 36"" fish  soon after we got a second fish... 38"" fish now we had the pattern going... speed... color... depth/line length...  time for lunch...  get back out... set up on the pattern again... bingo... another fish 40""  by this time its all around smiles...  now we are grinding and covering lots of water with the pattern we figured out...  bang... another fish at 42""  every fish was getting bigger...this i like...  at this point i was looking forward to the ""big"" bite window coming up in the evening... i figured if the fish were biting like this all day... that window may produce a big fish...  well the window produced a fish... but not the size i was hoping for... another nice musky at 43 inches...  so in the end... we trolled for 30-40 miles... 10 hours on the water... cut 8 hooks...5 musky boated...  36-38-40-42-43 inchers...
