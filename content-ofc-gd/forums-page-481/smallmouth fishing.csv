All responses appreciated, cheers in advance!  Keep your hooks sharp!  Monster"
628592,northernpike56,2011-10-07 12:06:00,717,"mepps spinners and 2-3"" rapala plugs work great in shallow water, tubes with jigheads in them work AMAZING in deeper water!! You could try drop shotting them too in deeper water"
628594,Rod Caster,2011-10-07 12:13:00,5784,"3-4 inch tubes, deep diving cranks, spinnerbaits work well for me... But it heavily depends on the type of water/cover your fishing. Weightless tubes and spinners should work well in the grass and adding a heavy jig head will allow you to hop/drag the tube in deeper waters. Good luck."
628596,Rod Caster,2011-10-07 12:14:00,5784,"Oh ya, as northern said, dropshots!!!"
628611,Jigger,2011-10-07 13:10:00,1237,"Some 1/2oz spinnerbaits, jerkbaits, tubes, grubs, dropshot gear."
628613,adolson,2011-10-07 13:16:00,783,"In my limited experience (which began in June), the lures the fish want changes from day to day and from body of water to body of water. The one lure that I've taken fish at my three main bass lakes with is the topwater Hula Popper. The original floating Rapalas work well too (perch color for me). I've caught them on tube jigs as well, Cordell Super Spots, Matzuo Rattle Eye Joes, gold Rattlin Rapalas, gold Wally Divers, and green Mangler Frogs. I also had fish on or follows with white spinner baits, Jitterbug, Live Target Frog, and Beetle Spins too. Lots of options, but for excitement, I say make sure you grab at least one topwater in your mix and give it a shot when the water's calm."

628624,Live2fish85,2011-10-07 13:38:00,1633,It all depends were you are fishing. For the most part head a bit deeper to a drop off and try tubes or drop shot. The bass will be slowing down on the most part. Last time I was out they wouldn't touch anything spinners or anything but soft plastics. If your in shallow try rippin something that rattles at a good spped see if ypu get a follow if you do have another rod ready with a softplastic and toss it out. Just remember the slower the better.
