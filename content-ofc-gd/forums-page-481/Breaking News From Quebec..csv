628427,Roy,2011-10-06 19:52:00,13728,"Grab it during a frost, Kevin."
628467,GBW,2011-10-06 21:34:00,8460,"As Roy said, frost.  If you can wait and want to be even safer wait till it's below zero for over a week."
628521,monsterfish,2011-10-07 00:38:00,48,Very nice report gentlemen!  Keep your hooks sharp!
628549,Fishing 24/7,2011-10-07 02:43:00,709,  what about when i bring it in heat in my garage ?  i mean when they unthaw the bees will wake up and a awrm will be in the garage how do i get ride of the bees .   im planning to go and grab it when the frost comes and put it in a big box ?
628602,GBW,2011-10-07 12:41:00,8460,PM Mike Gray as he might be able to help out there.  Here are the ones that were still looking for the nest around my place after one day (22 on the fly tape + flies).  The nest I had was not even as big as a tennis ball so keep in mind just how many you will have buzzing around... 
628603,Roy,2011-10-07 12:45:00,13728,"Good advice. I don't want to mislead you with the wasp disposal. BTW, that fire hydrant must be a buggar to find in the winter."
628604,GBW,2011-10-07 12:47:00,8460,"LOL, they just primed it yesterday for a new coat of yellow today"
628612,Jigger,2011-10-07 13:14:00,1237,"Not to get off topic, but awesome fish 24/7!!!"
628614,Jigger,2011-10-07 13:18:00,1237,Do you find the smallies take the jig on the fall most of the time or do you work it actively?
628726,Fishing 24/7,2011-10-07 19:25:00,709,  the first fall in the most important. usualy they hit on it.  then a couple of SLOW jigs.   when the jig is straight down near the boat i lift it up 6 '' off the bottom. slow jigging. this will get the fatties.
628729,fishnsled,2011-10-07 19:38:00,3520,"Just incredible! Sweet hawgs there guys, thanks for posting.  I've heard of double bagging a nest (garbage bags) and just let the wasps die off. Maybe triple bag that one, looks huge!"
628789,GBW,2011-10-08 00:31:00,8460,Your a tripple bagger...  HAHAHAHA
