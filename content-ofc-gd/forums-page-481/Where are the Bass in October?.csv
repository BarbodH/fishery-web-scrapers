628796,rhymobot,2011-10-08 00:55:00,174,Are the deeper in the lake? Close or far from shore?  What lures am I supposed to use to get to them this time of the year?  Thanks.

The fish that are going to  bite will be where the food is. Be prepared to switch tactics. I always figure that figuring out depth this time of year is waaaay more important than figuring out other variables like colour and lure selection."
