628240,tbayboy,2011-10-06 01:31:00,1497,"Hi everyone, convinced my wife that we need to go fishing this weekend (Monday most likely) but that means renting a boat.  Anyone got any idea who's still open and renting that they'd recommend?  I'll start calling a bunch but the couple I usually use aren't open so I'm looking for some recommendations.  Was thinking Rice but any of the kawartha's would be great.  Thanks Sean"
628247,scugpg,2011-10-06 01:42:00,1373,Call bay view resort on Lower Buckhorn. Should be still open and Doug or Margret will take care of you.
628253,Pigeontroller,2011-10-06 02:04:00,2793,"Call Andrea at Scotsmans Point on Buckhorn Lake, tell her Dax from Muskies Canada told you to call...She will give you the best deal you'll get! Great place, decent rental boats."

628296,Big Cliff,2011-10-06 10:55:00,6899,I know that Lunge Haven (Sturgeon Lake) still had boats and cottages available as of yesterday.  (705) 324-6610
628312,Rizzo,2011-10-06 11:59:00,4754, ...we did that and she charged us more  :D
628339,Michael_Brown,2011-10-06 13:58:00,411,BJ Tackle in Bewdley or McGregor Bay Marina on the north side of Rice. Most Rice lake resorts are still open for the long weekend and have boats for rent. The fish are cranked with good walleye and smallmouth bites on crankbaits around hard bottom drop offs. Largemouth are a little tougher but look for deep green weed and you can find bunches.    A couple of Rice Lake fall fatties (the fish).  Good Luck and have fun.
628474,tbayboy,2011-10-06 21:56:00,1497,Thanks everyone - all booked and set.  Hopefully I'll have a good report to post.
