Does anyone know where to buy the needed tools and accessories locally? I'm within a 2 hour drive to Toronto and Windsor area, so ideally, if there is a place within reach of these areas, that would be preferred.  Thanks in advance."

Otherwise, you can get various parts at the big tackle shops.   Of the smaller shops, I know Angling Specialties carries a lot components."
