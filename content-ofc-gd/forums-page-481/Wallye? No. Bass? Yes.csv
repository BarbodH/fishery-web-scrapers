628212,Rod Caster,2011-10-06 00:28:00,5784,"I couldn't get the walleye to bite today so I switched to bass mode with a wacky worm rig and caught 3 nice large mouth bass. Smallies are much more common up here so it was nice to hook into some LMB.  Weightless fishing isn't easy.   Its tough to get a ""feel"" for the wacky rig since it's very much a visual style of fishing, watching the line for movement, the surface for boils and using polarized glasses to see below the surface. I found myself being very impatient and reeling in too fast and twitching it too hard but after I got my first one I slowed things down and worked harder at keeping the canoe still. I'm still a bass fisherman-in-training so I can only imagine how many 4 or 5 pound fish a REAL bass fisherman would have caught at this location.  the biggest one was approximately 19inches      "

628265,adolson,2011-10-06 02:36:00,783,Nice! I'd like to catch a largemouth some day. Don't think there are any close by.
628266,mercman,2011-10-06 02:44:00,7054," I dont know, Dana Some of those lakes you been fishing in show potential.Lily pads, logs, overhangs, weedbeds and inside weedlines."
628318,LucG,2011-10-06 12:16:00,779,Good job buddy! Sorry I couldnt make it!
628855,rockfish,2011-10-08 09:18:00,91,"Nice bass, I just started using the wacky rig this summer past and I was just slowly jigging it. I'd also speed up the retrieve, not letting it drop so much and that caught some bass too in the dark."
628885,Dave Bailey,2011-10-08 14:23:00,1641," They are up there, just keep washing lures until something takes it."
629011,Rod Caster,2011-10-08 22:22:00,5784,"Dana, I'm not sure what the northern boundary is for largies, but I don't know any spots past Marten River. It seems most of the largie lakes in my area are south of North Bay."
