She has only ever fished once before in her life and that was when she visited here 3 years ago....i think we were both surprised and pleased that my love of fishing was after all a genetic phenomenon!   Anyhow, i went to that little local lake i have been at all month. I have been catching litterally hundreds of small pike so thought it would be fun to put her on fish non stop with the easy technique of trolling spinners and minnows. The plan worked and we had a blast catching pike after pike with a few perch thrown in.   Mum also got a nice walleye which she was very pleased about, and we left with 4 nice fat walleye too! She tells me she is definitely up for a trip to Lac Seul. I warned her that it is a pretty bumpy ride up there....lol....she said...""I have to do it so i can say i did""....love it.
