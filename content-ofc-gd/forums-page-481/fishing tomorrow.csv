628755,peter23,2011-10-07 22:15:00,95,going to one of the kawarthas tomorrow for muskie. at this time of year do you thing mag bulldawgs would work or should i stick to the cowgirls and other blade baits?
628759,davey buoy,2011-10-07 22:21:00,5505,I don't know for sure but why wouldn't you switch it up every 20-30mins if no action? That's normal anytime when searching for bass or any or fish you are targeting .Good luck davey.
628760,Handlebarz,2011-10-07 22:30:00,3790,Try sticking to your normal program at first as these warm days will get them moving blades cranks and jerk baits will get the job done. I would say yes the mag will work as they do work all years for some guys if its something you normally use giver hell with it.  Good luck with this summer Thanksgiving weekend
