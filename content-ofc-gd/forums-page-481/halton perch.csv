I fish at lasalle marina whenever I get the time but I dont think I could eat them given theyre out of hamilton harbour. One night I landed (and threw back) about 30 10-14 inchers from lasalle! Would any other spots out of lake O have edible perch? or should I go to somewhere like port dover or port maitland or some conservation areas to get them?  Thanks in advance, your help is greatly appreciated  Matt"
