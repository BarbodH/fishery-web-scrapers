628262,northernpike56,2011-10-06 02:29:00,717,"no, in fact the water level has DROPPED. I was there last weekend and could walk out onto ""islands"" that had been created by the dropped water level... oh and did I mention I caught no pike?"
628271,Sawyer,2011-10-06 02:53:00,48,"Hi Zeeter,  This time of year, water levels at Mountsberg tend to be on the low side.  As the summer progresses, the water levels continue to drop - especially if we had a substantially dry one.  I fished the reservoir once in the month of November and I had to walk 30 ft from the usual shoreline to launch my canoe.  -Sawyer"
628272,zeeter,2011-10-06 02:57:00,92,"Wow ! Thanks, guys.   You saved me some time.  I'll have to find another place to go on."
628380,FishTracker,2011-10-06 17:29:00,47, I think I was there!
