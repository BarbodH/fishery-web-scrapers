628641,Musky or Specks,2011-10-07 15:03:00,2710,My buddy and I have always fished out of Belle River with no luck for skis we want to try something different next Sunday and have heard good things about the mouth of the Thames at this time of the year. My question for the LSC guys is where to launch or do we have to run from Belle River.  PS Any tips or locations are welcome by PM.  Thanks Brad
