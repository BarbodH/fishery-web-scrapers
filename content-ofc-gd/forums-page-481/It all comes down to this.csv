628445,kickingfrog,2011-10-06 20:35:00,8333,"Arguing, name-calling, absurd accusations, seemingly endless debates, ""us"" versus ""them"", mud slinging and alarming amounts of money wasted all comes down to this....                                         HOCKEY IS BACK!"

628524,misfish,2011-10-07 00:53:00,29133,"The game is showing todays times. Even the officals are tree huggers.  Don nailed it.  Play the game as it was meant to be.  And for those that are hockey parents today,think back when you played.Oh wait,maybe you didnt and thought this was a safe sport for your son/daughter to play.A good hit,was a hit,ya it hurts sometimes,but thats contact. A cheap shot .If you got called on it,so be it.After that, it was dealt in time. Oh that would mean""fighting"". Something like a good friend sticking up for your son or daughter at school.   Im    watching this game.   UNREAL  Great show in the PEG"
628534,Rod Caster,2011-10-07 01:43:00,5784,Its only the first game... And Don is only one opinion. Last year had some very low hitting games too.
