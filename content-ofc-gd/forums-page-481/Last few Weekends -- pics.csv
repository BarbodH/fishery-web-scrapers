628276,johnnyb,2011-10-06 03:10:00,3413,"Noticed that I haven't posted any pics as of late...September was a beautiful month for fishing but totally fizzled out in terms of opportunities for me. Here's a little bit of what I've managed on a few visits to Minden and Muskoka since the end of August....hope you enjoy.   Gotta give my girl credit on this one...she grabbed the rod and was doing a crazy figure eight until the rockbass couldn't take it anymore!   Took this guy on a swammer in about 6 feet of water on a beautiful new piece of shoreline I discovered   Smallies in Muskoka were lovin' the wacky worm on Labour Day weekend....my brother slept in so I was forced to do the lame self pics....got a couple like this   When he finally woke up and hopped in the boat...a few casts with a minnow bait and he slammed this chunky fella. Not bad.   This one was a thriller...we had been swimming in Minden on the last weekend of September...water was a cool 65F...were drying off on the dock and saw this brute swimming by. I sprinted to the car for my rod, tossed out a Live Target smelt pattern and watched this guy react.   Back to Muskoka last weekend with Bicephalic and his brother....more smallies on the wacky worm   Eeeeee!!!!!   Bicephalic and his brother with a delayed double header....more minnow-baits in close to shore.   And that's about it...heading up to Minden this weekend....likely more family time than fishing....but...I'll try to manage a few more pics for the board  And I'll try to keep my shirt on"
