628224,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-06 00:46:00,4399, Come back tomorrow good chance someone will top it!
628234,solopaddler,2011-10-06 01:25:00,8605,"C'mon guys, there's no way this guy is for real."
628238,mercman,2011-10-06 01:29:00,7054,  I tried to tell 'em that earlier
628250,Muskieman,2011-10-06 02:01:00,2472,"Well...........  I can't read what the sign says(fine print). with that said .... Now..... I'm not siding in any direction... But........ is this a MNR sign?   Is it enforced by the Province or the Municipality?( because of safety reasons)... If it's from a Municipality it doesn't matter the Provincial laws overrule... (I've been through this).. I don't condone this behavior ... but what does the ""BOOK"" say?  Is it really a sanctuary?  Not pokin' at the Beesnest but wondering ?  Randy "
628255,OutdoorDan,2011-10-06 02:12:00,325,"Randy,   I'm fairly certain that it's a wire that is exactly 75 feet below the entrance to the fish ladder."
628257,SirCranksalot,2011-10-06 02:16:00,3291,"I was at the Clendenan dam last week and there was a guy doing that----caught a salmon that way. I thought it was illegal but wasn't sure , so I couldn't say anything."
628259,dave524,2011-10-06 02:19:00,4508," There's a fish ladder there   as per the regs it is illegal to fish within 75 feet of the downstream entrance of a fishladder anywhere, anytime in the Province of Ontario. Some have wires some don't, the practice is even more flagrantly illegal where there is a wire"
628260,MJL,2011-10-06 02:26:00,2427, You’d be surprised what people post on the internet. In the last couple of years people have:  - posted pictures of themselves catching tons of fish from out of season sanctuaries and bragging about it...Only after did they realize they just incriminated themselves  - promoted the fact that they line spawning fish off redds for the sole purpose of posting hero shots on message boards.  The fact is you don’t require a license or an IQ test to access the internet
628268,Muskieman,2011-10-06 02:46:00,2472,"Thank You! ""dave524""  I have no clue what a Fish ladder looks like as per page #8 Ontario Regs 2011..........IT'S ILLEGAL!!!  Lionized here's to you !!!!   smarten up ! *******  STOP IT !!!!********  people like you make people like me punch holes in the wall !!!  MAN!!!  :wallbash:   Randy "
628270,adolson,2011-10-06 02:50:00,783,"Agreed, but the government ought to have already stopped the mega quarry and that didn't happen yet, so it's not a shock. I've yet to see a single CO out, and I've been fishing quite a lot this summer. Maybe it's just my area, but I'd like to see them."
628274,BillM,2011-10-06 03:02:00,17367,We have been trolled.
628317,aplumma,2011-10-06 12:08:00,6896,I think all has been said here. bedtime for this one.  Art
628143,Lionized,2011-10-05 21:51:00,19,"So last night I tried my luck at the Thornbury Dam given the time of year. Made my way to be the closest fisherman to the dam. Great Spot! There was a Guy on the other side of the river casting towards the dam underneath the ""this area is closed to fishing"" wire and within 10 minutes he had pulled 2 female rainbows and called it a day. Taking them home of course.  Well the same guy shows up today and he yells to me I'm casting to far under the wire and I'd get In trouble. 15ft is Ok but anything further is worthy of me losing my gear and vehicle. Wowzas!  If that's the case then the signage should be much more explanatory. Something like, ""No fishing this area or casting under this wire"" would be a better sign to let one know. Even a lousy lawyer could get you off ""the hook"" with vague signage like this.  I yelled back that he was a Hypocrite for doing the same thing the night before, which bothered him.  I'm sure a lot of eyes are rolling at me, but u don't get your fishing license the same way you get your driver's license. The MNR should either provide more detailed signage to what an infraction could be or build something better than this overhanging wire that people can cast under.  Looking forward to be told I'm wrong! "
628145,misfish,2011-10-05 21:55:00,29133,"Looks like theres room for signage in many langauges.Ya, I dont spell to good.Get my drift?"
628146,irishfield,2011-10-05 21:56:00,26272,"How's about you read the Ontario Fishing Regulations and measure how far you are from the FISHWAY !  I think ""This Area CLOSED to Fishing"" is pretty self explanitory !"
628148,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-10-05 21:57:00,1107,Really
628150,danbouck,2011-10-05 22:02:00,4380,WOW
628151,skeeter,2011-10-05 22:02:00,1907,"If you cast there, then you are fishing there!!!!"
628152,capt bruce,2011-10-05 22:04:00,820,"Well you are glad you were looking forward to it ,here it comes , I grew up fishing that river with my dad , 20+ years ,when there was no need for a wire , have not been there in many many years , you know whats right and wrong just because someone else does not does not give you the right to be an ass , no more river fishing for me , to many yahoos .What fun is it to fish illgal ??????????? oh but someone else does and he got a bigger fish than me !!!!!!"
628155,misfish,2011-10-05 22:09:00,29133, Dont be so harsh with those words Bruce. There are some that are not .
628157,Roy,2011-10-05 22:17:00,13728,"Still up to your little games are you, lyin' eyes?"
628160,capt bruce,2011-10-05 22:23:00,820,"You know I know that Brian , but those guys do not fight for the spot closest to the damn and than cry when smoeone beats them too it , lots of good river fishing but behind the wire at a damn , B when was the last time you did that , 'NEVER HAVE AND YOU NEVER WILL "" enough said ."
628161,misfish,2011-10-05 22:27:00,29133,"  I just walk on by,way down the river. Im sure Im not the only one to say that Bruce. And yes,I know."
628164,MJL,2011-10-05 22:44:00,2427, Agreed  Personally I’ve never understood the fascination with fishing right next to a sanctuary boundary when there are miles and miles of better water to fish.
628170,Musky or Specks,2011-10-05 23:00:00,2710,"Know plenty who aren't but they are far outnumbered by Yahoo's. It's why I stopped steelheading and took up musky fishing and believe me I'am a far better steelheader than a musky fisherman. Matter of fact just recently sold my custom steelheading rod(stenciled with ""Yahoo"" by the way) cause I realized I haven't missed it and just ain't going to go back."
628173,MJL,2011-10-05 23:12:00,2427," Muskies are the fish of 10,000 casts...Statistically you're already at a disadvantage"

628176,mercman,2011-10-05 23:19:00,7054,I get the feeling the OP started this thread just to start a bit of trouble Possible?
628177,asdve23rveavwa,2011-10-05 23:20:00,2690,S................nah.
628178,Musky or Specks,2011-10-05 23:21:00,2710,Yes I suspect he was trolling this fishing site as well.
628184,buckster,2011-10-05 23:27:00,530,"""This area is closed to fishing""	Be it by 15 feet or 15 inches you're still breaking the law.  	I don't understand how someone can fish such a boring drift like that one!  Out of all my years fishing that river i can count on one hand how many times i've fished that wire.   "
628188,OutdoorDan,2011-10-05 23:43:00,325,"So how many years before the MNR puts a hanging curtain from that wire to clarify what ""This area is closed to fishing"" means?"
628190,Pigeontroller,2011-10-05 23:53:00,2793,"If you are an conservationist and have any regard for the fishery you enjoy so much, you wouldn't mess with fish in a sanctuary!"

628207,Pickeral eater,2011-10-06 00:19:00,155,Pretty straight forward.
628214,misfish,2011-10-06 00:30:00,29133," This is why we need more MNR. Yes there are many areas to cover,fishing an hunting. Whats wrong with our goverment?  They dont see the ,CANADIAN WHOLE PICTURE."
