628637,rob v,2011-10-07 14:53:00,535,Anyone familiar with the process for changing the oil filter on one of these units.   Better yet - where is it ?  I bought one used a couple of years back (mid 80's model) and haven't been able to find a manual or figure out how to change the oil filter ( i assume there is one someplace - perhaps internally ?)
628638,irishfield,2011-10-07 14:56:00,26272,Doubt it Rob... not one on my Honda 5. Isn't one on my 2007 9.9 Merc pro kicker either
628644,GBW,2011-10-07 15:17:00,8460,what is the serial number on the Honda?
628646,GBW,2011-10-07 15:18:00,8460,This may help http://marine.honda.com/pdf/manuals/3193501.pdf
628647,GBW,2011-10-07 15:21:00,8460,"sorry, this one is from 1985 the other is from the 70's...  http://marine.honda.com/pdf/manuals/31882621.pdf"
628771,Fisherman,2011-10-07 23:43:00,7201,"I had an '84 BF75 and it did not have an oil filter, the only thing it has is a screen strainer on the bottom of the oil pump pickup tube and that's on the inside of the motor."
628776,rob v,2011-10-07 23:46:00,535,"thanks GBW -  my serial # is BF75L  - 1700986  - would that suggest it was made in '86 ?  I did a little more looking around and it seems there is no oil filter per se - but a screen around the "" oil pick up pipe "" - right inside the engine housing..  Apparently the only way to get at it is to take the engine right off...... so i guess as long as i have not problems I'm leaving it the way it is - change the engine oil regularly and keep it clean I guess !"
628777,rob v,2011-10-07 23:47:00,535,sorry fisherman - looks like our posts (that both say the same thing) crossed in cyber space !
628786,GBW,2011-10-08 00:28:00,8460,glad to help.  I have 2 Honda's too...
