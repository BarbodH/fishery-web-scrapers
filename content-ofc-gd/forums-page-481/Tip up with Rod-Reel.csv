628802,Leecher,2011-10-08 01:05:00,7832,You don't need them spring loaded setup to go out ice fishing... I've made quite a few tipups in my hard water fishing career and know that the last ones I made were the very best   with reels         Sorry 12footspringbok but ice fishing isn't boring at all to any hard water angler that want to have a great time on the ice even when it's -20C    No Paul... sitting on the hard stuff catching these    is what I call having fun       Sorry Lew but ice fishing to me brings joy and happiness when I'm up against the element and truly enjoy catching all kinds of species of fish that want to come out and play   No different than fishing for ski's in late fall when the temps dip under
628830,GBW,2011-10-08 03:44:00,8460,"mon ami!  (dang, did I spell it right? )"
628838,Uncle Buck,2011-10-08 04:20:00,1000,"i've never caught anything on my automatic fisherman...  here is a tip though...  buy the one that comes with the rod/reel, trying to get a rod with the proper eye placement is almost impossible..."
628382,BucktownAngler,2011-10-06 17:31:00,582,I came across these 2 tip ups that use a rod and reel instead of the traditional way.  does anybody use anything like this? how do you like it? has anybody seen these for sale locally? (GTA)  http://www.automaticicefisherman.com/  http://www.slammertipup.com/   
628383,mike rousseau,2011-10-06 17:32:00,4661,I do believe these are illegal in Ontario..  Can't use anything that sets the hook automatically...
628390,Spiel,2011-10-06 18:10:00,9065,"This has been discussed before and if I remember correctly they are legal in Ontario, no different than a rod set in a downrigger.  But to answer the question, I've never tried one."
628394,mike rousseau,2011-10-06 18:21:00,4661,"  must be a kind of loop hole....  cause it is illigal to...  â€¢ Possess a spring gaff, snagger or spear gun within 30 m (98 ft.) of any waters. A spring gaff includes any spring loaded device which sets the hook for an angler. No person shall take fish with a gaff, snare, snagger or spear gun. A gaff, other than a spring gaff, may be used to assist in landing fish caught by lawful means.   this is why i havent bought any..."
628397,Spiel,2011-10-06 18:28:00,9065," I'm aware of the regs Mike but this is not a ""spring gaff,"" this set up is merely a rod bent over in a release, like a down rigger or side planer, no springs involved just a bent rod in a release mechanism."
628399,Roy,2011-10-06 18:32:00,13728,That would make trolling illegal as well.
628403,irishfield,2011-10-06 18:35:00,26272,I thought it was around here Roy..
628404,BucktownAngler,2011-10-06 18:38:00,582,i've already looked into the legality of this. it is definetly legal...confirmed by MNR
628409,adempsey,2011-10-06 19:13:00,1498,"Never used one, but they've been around a while.   The Simcoe board seemed spammed with respect to the Slammer by a couple of users last season, so I'd imagine you can find them in the tackle shops in that area."
628418,motion,2011-10-06 19:37:00,403,"Are you referring to the old ""Quickdraw"". There was quite the heated discussion  on the Simcoe board about this last year. I wouldn't use it myself, but thats just my opinion.  Cheers"
628420,mike rousseau,2011-10-06 19:39:00,4661,  Thanks for the facts... Not opinion
628426,mike rousseau,2011-10-06 19:51:00,4661,Check out automaticfisherman on YouTube...  They look pretty sweet...  They set the hook for you before the fish can drop the bait... Wich is aparentky legal...  I'll be buying 1 or 2 this winter now that I know they're legal...
628430,GoneFishin,2011-10-06 19:58:00,349,"My grandfather made one about 30 years ago that he gave to me. I could see it being good for the right size fish (jumbo perch) But most other fish will shake the hook before you get to it, if they do get hooked at all."
628435,Terry,2011-10-06 20:06:00,14456, is that what those 2 morons were talking about..... the Quickdraw piece of garbage
628436,Jds63,2011-10-06 20:06:00,1365,more ice gear to test ???? my wife will kill me !!!
628462,adempsey,2011-10-06 21:11:00,1498," Woops, my mistake.  Yes, I mixed up the Slammer with the Quickdraw."
628468,GBW,2011-10-06 21:38:00,8460,looks like I will be tinkering around this year to make one for crappie and perch fishing.  I guess I better try and figure out a way for it not to set the hook to hard on those paper mouth's...
628561,Nipfisher,2011-10-07 03:16:00,2449,Lots of guys use them on Nipissing. I stick with the door-stopper spring tip up that way I dont have to get out of my warm hut if I know it is just a dink perch playing with my minnow. Once those automatic doo-dads are set off you have to go reset them.
628571,Bondar,2011-10-07 06:13:00,817,Oh cool another product to make ice fishing even more boring  not you don't even need to hold a rod or set the hook LOL
628581,12footspringbok,2011-10-07 10:53:00,459, Boring?  Whats more exilerating than running and gunning all over the lake when its -20? LOL
628649,Remastered,2011-10-07 15:41:00,143,"Speaking of tip-ups, are wind tip ups legal here?"
628650,Spiel,2011-10-07 15:44:00,9065, Yes.
628651,mercman,2011-10-07 15:47:00,7054,"  Sitting in the dentists office, waiting for root canal work."
628738,BucktownAngler,2011-10-07 20:35:00,582, this is much better then a regular tip up IMO...at least you get to fight the fish with a rod & reel
628740,lew,2011-10-07 20:42:00,12766,"Ice fishing isn't boring at all, it's right up there with watching 5 pin bowling on the TV"
