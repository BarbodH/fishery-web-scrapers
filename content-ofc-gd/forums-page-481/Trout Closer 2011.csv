628323,fish_finder,2011-10-06 12:56:00,370,"Managed to get out to my favourite Grey/Bruce trout stream last friday to close out the trout season.  This particular stream had it pretty rough this year with the lack of rain.  Luckily in the days leading up to closer last week we got a bunch of rain, which put the river up nicely.    This river is a gem to fish, mainly because its full of good sized browns that are usually quite willing to play.  The day was cold, overcast and rainy.....perfect for stream trout!  We started out with many smaller fish taking wooly buggers and various nymph patterns.  The brookies we're in full spawning dress, beautiful!    Needless to say, there were lots of those, as well as quite a few little bows to be had.  Justin got this colourful rainbow swinging a bugger through a fast run.     The top of this stretch, near the access point gets fished pretty heavily, and large fish are scarce.  Those willing to hike a ways downstream through a gauntlet of Cedars and other tangles are generally rewarded with some bigger fish.  Its tough getting down there, but well worth it.  On 4 consecutive casts, I managed 4 browns ranging from 15 to 18 inches.  I wasn't complaining!!  It was pretty funny actually.  Usually when you take a fish over 12 or 13 inches from a pool, anything else in there of any size spooks and won't come out to play....not the case this time though!  I figure they were probably starting to pair up for the spawn as I did get a good mix of bucks and hens.           We fished till dark, then grabbed a hotel room and some grub, a couple glasses of scotch and some rest.  Fished a GB trib for a few hours on saturday in search of steel before heading home.  The river was actually up quite a bit, and pretty dirty.  Less than 4 inches vis.  Saw a few silver flashes, but no solid hookups at all.  More Justangles, of course!!    Finished out an awesome trout season, on an awesome little stream.....  Fall is here, bring on the CHROME!!!!   "

628392,fish_finder,2011-10-06 18:18:00,370,"Thanks folks.  Was an awesome weekend indeed.  Now the only problem is the 7 month wait to do the resident trout thing.  I guess I'll just have to focus on Musky, Rainbows and Browns for now!!!!"
628407,Spiel,2011-10-06 19:11:00,9065,"Sweet report Dave, I'm envious!"
628410,fish_finder,2011-10-06 19:16:00,370, Hah!  Maybe next spring/summer we can try and hook up for a day out on the water bud.  dave
628412,Spiel,2011-10-06 19:19:00,9065,That'd be awesome.    I'm familiar with most of the areas up that way but it's been far too long since I fished them. Give me a heads up in the spring and we'll see if we can't put something together!
628428,fish_finder,2011-10-06 19:55:00,370,I'll definitely do that man.
628429,misfish,2011-10-06 19:57:00,29133,"Simply beautiful. Not a fly guy,but do like watching it performed.It,s an ART.  Thanks for taking the time to post. Great photos."
628434,Spiel,2011-10-06 20:05:00,9065, I look (anxiously) forward to it.

628699,fish_finder,2011-10-07 17:32:00,370," We'll do our best to git out next year to a couple of the stretches I frequent.  Not gonna guarantee anything, but they are very low traffic areas"
