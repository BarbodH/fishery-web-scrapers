I Picked up some BooYah weedless bucktail jigs, and i am going to tip them with some tubes that Brian(Misfish) sent me this summer.Black/blue, Chartreuse/black, Brown/gold bucktails, with watermelon/pink tubes. I found a few spots where the current flows over skinny water, into a deep V chanel with a rocky bottom on one side, and a gradual muddy slope on the other.Last weekend, i could see them on sonar, but couldnt tease them into biting.Hopefully wit this nice weather, i will get into them.  I'll let you know how it works out.  Paul"
