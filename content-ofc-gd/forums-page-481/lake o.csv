628183,Fang,2011-10-05 23:26:00,1330,"In side shallow bite in the fall is a tight early morning window. I fish Oakville and my fall (post Sept 1st) program is to set up in 180, watch the graph, spread the lines down to 60 ft deep and start searching out to deeper water. Off 16 mile in Sept/Oct 180-220 is kind of the magic zone. There's a decent mix of bows and 3 year olds and shakers of all species. I find once we get a few cold nights its a smaller spoon program and 1.9-2.4 MPH best speed range. Have been itching myself to get out so maybe a Sunday run is in order.  If you havenn't run across this site bookmark it  Lake O wind forecast  Saves times/gas and makes a safer journey. Friday looks perfect  good luck and let us know"
