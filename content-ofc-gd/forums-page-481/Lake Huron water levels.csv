628421,cjgraham,2011-10-06 19:44:00,104,I have a cottage on Huron just past the Sault. I would say the water has gone down a good ten inches since August. Anyone else have a boat in the mud like me?  
628442,OutdoorDan,2011-10-06 20:33:00,325,My boat is in Waubaushene on Georgian Bay and getting out from the Hwy. 400 area I can tell that water is down almost a foot.  I stirred up a lot of mud getting out of the marina.

628541,cjgraham,2011-10-07 02:18:00,104,  Yeah Superior is up almost to is average. Nice wet summer here in northern ontario. But all the rivers in this watershed flow into Superior. I am thinking more of Huron relies on southern ontario flow. Thats my assumption. Sucks though because I have to get my boat out somehow this weekend
