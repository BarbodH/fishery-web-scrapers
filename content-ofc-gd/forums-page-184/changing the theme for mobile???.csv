906823,manitoubass2,2015-03-29 18:22:00,11391,I used to be able to change the skin or theme on my galaxy s5 for the site by going down to the bottom left hand corner.  Now my skin changed and I cant change it back to the mobile version?  Whats up with that? Or a yone know how to change it back?  The normal website on mobile is a major headache to navigate and post
906839,Spiel,2015-03-29 19:12:00,9065,"No issues with mine on Mobile. But given the recent posts it would seem we have a ""ghost in the machine."" Affects some, not others.  Stay tuned."
906840,manitoubass2,2015-03-29 19:14:00,11391,Yep no doubt spiel.  Hopefully it gets resolved soon because this is a royal pain.  I must really love this site cause I keep on posting lol
906841,Terry,2015-03-29 19:17:00,14456,"you might see this as an addiction but  the button to change it is there but  invisible  it is right beside this button ..just click or drig till it shows up if you still can't find it if you change your computer to mobile version, your phone should change too"
906845,manitoubass2,2015-03-29 19:24:00,11391,"  Lol funny guy hahahaha  I already tried that terry and all it shows me is xml codes or something like that???  My pc should have zero effect because i havent used it for like 2 years, but ill try it i suppose"
906847,manitoubass2,2015-03-29 19:26:00,11391,"Oh nevermind you were right terry, go figure. It is there its just near invisible.  Thank sir"
906848,Spiel,2015-03-29 19:28:00,9065,"That ""invisible button""  only showed up on my mobile mid way through last evening. I have no answer as to why yet."
906849,Terry,2015-03-29 19:28:00,14456,that is why they pay me the big bucks  and I hoped you did see it as a joke..lol i did  glad I  could help
906850,davey buoy,2015-03-29 19:29:00,5505,"I usually log on every day from my cell,would be nice that when you choose a theme there would be some way of saving it?.Not a big deal,but you still have to trek to the bottom left and choose it each time you log in."
906851,manitoubass2,2015-03-29 19:32:00,11391, Thanks Sir appreciate the help!
906852,Terry,2015-03-29 19:34:00,14456,"if you log in with the ip board skin then go to the bottom of the page somewhere it will say use mobile version, that should say every time you go to the site but you do need to log in to have it save the cookie and your phone must be set to save cookies"
906853,manitoubass2,2015-03-29 19:39:00,11391,Mine just stays logged in. Doesnt hurt anything.
906856,davey buoy,2015-03-29 19:48:00,5505,"Mine just stays logged in. Doesnt hurt anything. I'm logged in all the time,it's always the blue screen when I first  go on till i choose a theme.Earthbound is the skin once I change it."

Mines done the same thing since the last major board change. Never used to be a problem."
