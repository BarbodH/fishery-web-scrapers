906820,RickOnt,2015-03-29 18:17:00,669,I broke the tip off a favorite  and am looking for a replacement.  I have the old eye but the tube part is very small.  I was thinking I could drill it out but the smallest drill I have is 1/16 which is not even close.  I am having a problem finding a replacement eye with the mounting tube as small as the UL rod.  Anyone know where I can purchase a replacement?  Thanks Rick
906830,Moosebunk,2015-03-29 18:43:00,3970,"Rick, you can buy different guides for the rod tip at pretty well any place that sells fishing gear.  Just glue a new one back on.  Really do like the St.Croix ice fishing rods and haven't had issue.  Use them all winter long.  Eyelet problems such as the rings falling out from third to tip and, easy rod and rod tip breakage for their regular rods have been a huge problem."

906837,Bondar,2015-03-29 19:04:00,817,Is there any of the rod sticking out of the broke eye at all? If so heat it with a lighter a bit and it should pull right out
906843,RickOnt,2015-03-29 19:20:00,669,"Bunk   All the eyes I have found are just too big.  On MudHole the smallest is 1.6mm Which is 1/16"" If all else fails I think I will get the 1.6mm and use some epoxy to fill the void.  Brian PM returned  Bondar  Thanks for tip but unfortunately it is broken flush."
906844,misfish,2015-03-29 19:22:00,29133,got it.
906861,Moosebunk,2015-03-29 19:53:00,3970,"Ahhhh right.  ""UL""... (and ice rod to boot) Have the same and it is one skinny blank at the hole shot.  My money is on Brian.  Go get'em Tiger!"
906865,Sinker,2015-03-29 20:02:00,8692,"Heat up a safety pin, stick it in where thhe broken bit is, let cool.  Once cool, heat tube with lighter and broken bit may pull out."
906874,RickOnt,2015-03-29 20:37:00,669,Sinker       That just might work!!  Thanks
906876,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-29 20:51:00,2582,I did the same thing to the same rod Rick...the very first day I used it    I just cut it back to the next eye. The perch don't care. I actually like the rod better shorter. Less hook sets hitting the roof of my trap.
906877,RickOnt,2015-03-29 20:54:00,669,"Yes Steve   I thought of that and that is for sure an option,  It would just be a 25""M,    Which as you say works fine"
906891,porkpie,2015-03-29 21:41:00,2521,"You can buy a standard guide and wrap it on with thread.  Plenty of float rods don't have a tip guide, but instead use a standard guide wrapped in place.  No doubt you can find a micro guide to suit, just make sure it's single foot."
906916,Spiel,2015-03-29 23:30:00,9065,"Tip guides have 2 measurements, ring size in mm and tube size in 64ths of an inch. If you can figure out what the sizes are Rick I'll check my supply for you."

906989,misfish,2015-03-30 13:51:00,29133,"Ready for PU Rick. The drill size was .80 mm  Me poor eyes strained, to see the dang thing."
906992,Spiel,2015-03-30 14:09:00,9065,"Ready for PU Rick. The drill size was .80 mm  Me poor eyes strained, to see the dang thing.  Awesome!"
