907034,Big Cliff,2015-03-30 17:30:00,6899,"My Andy oh my Andy. Got him when he was only 6 weeks old. I had to drive from Milton to McHenery Il to get him. Turned out to be the worst snow storm of the winter but I am not known for giving up.  From the time I was 14 I always wanted a GSP but for a number of reasons it just didn't happen. By the time I was 35 I was finally in a position where I could get one and had the time to work with one.  I searched long and hard for the perfict partner and finally came across Sue. Ok, now I could round it off with the perfect dog which turned out to be Andy LOL.  Andy amazed everyone he ever met. He won his first field trial at 5 months and never looked back. CKC, AKC, NAVHDA, Canadian Show Champion that boy just won it all.  He was a champion from birth, son of Shooting Star Sharp Shooter & Grouse Vom Riverwoods, Katiebow's Andy! I wouldn't have cared if he never did anything but he did!   Oh I miss him so much, we spent so many wonderful hours together fishing, hunting, he didn't care just as long as we were together! When my time comes our ashes will be mixed together forever. Oh, BTW, Never did lock him in the trunk though."
907038,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-30 17:38:00,8243,Great memories eh Cliff. My neighbor Mr. Hummason trained retrievers right up until he passed. He had a number of champion pups over the years. He would fly them all over North America for hunting. What an interesting man Fred was. He had some stories.
907040,manitoubass2,2015-03-30 17:54:00,11391,"What great family member Simon!  My oldest girl is in the market for a pup, were having a hard time deciding. Id love a lab, she kinda sold on a german sheppard.  More then anything id like an elk hound? My boys grandma has two and they are the wickedest dogs ever  Alaskan or norwegian elk hound I think? Cant really remember?  Ive never seen a dog that will take down wolves to protect its property, drag it home them lay down with a young tot and fall asleep"

Haven't seen the wolf since. Never seen a tougher dog, he seriously kicks butt and most large dogs seriously regret showing him any dominance! It's funny in one sense, but I don't want him hurting someone else's beloved pet."
907055,manitoubass2,2015-03-30 19:10:00,11391,"We still have two huskys, our oldest just passed?  They are awesome dogs, but the two of them have totally different personalities. One is basically a loveable lap dog, very adventerous and funny. My bigger girl is great with wolves and coyotes. A true hunting and fishing dog. Catches abit of attitude at times bit very good dog.  There both good with kids and other dogs, but super protective at times with our property."
907057,manitoubass2,2015-03-30 19:11:00,11391,And sorry for the thread derail Simon.  Maybe ill post up a seperate thread.  My bad
907105,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-30 21:20:00,8243,"Simon, I hear you about the species stereotype. Land Shark!!!! She was constantly called a Pit Bull, I got tired of correcting people. She was the biggest suck in the world. She was beyond smart. That puppy would run and sit herself in front of the TV at exactly 5PM Monday to Friday, never Saturdays or Sundays. She would start crying until the 5PM episode of Wild Kingdom was on. She would watch the wildlife until a commercial was on then ask for a treat. If I put her outside when that show was on she would lose it until I let her in to watch her show. Man I miss her undying love. I never got another to replace her because she was unreplaceable, I have tried to do it but always backed down when push came to shove. She had a brindle coat and one black eye patch.  Easy to replace a wife, a dog not so much."

906879,limeyangler,2015-03-29 21:09:00,5204,"Hi all,  me and the pup headed down the ice road for some C&R relaxation.   I've said it before and say it again, what an awesome friend he is, never complains, always happy to see you,   Never lies to you or plays mind games, won't steal from you, talk behind your back,   Not a mean atom in his handsome brown body, all he asks is to sleep at my feet at the end of the bed,   Two bowls of kibble a day, big hugs and games of tug 'o' war, some water,   Sticks thrown in the lake, and not to be shouted at too loudly when harassing the cats!   If this was Facebook it would be one of those ""share if you love your dog"" posts.                                             VIDEO "

My husky is a bit of a dummy when it comes to going fishing; he'll wander, visit every group of people he can find and doesn't always get along with other male dogs. Yesterday he got freaked out by people doing some target practice as I'm loading my sled into the truck, right beside a highway. That was a nightmare, had to drag him from under my truck like 4 times.  Overall he's good though, definitely likes going on long runs."

My life definitely wouldn't be the same without my little beagle...I dread the day I have to say good-bye to my little hunting buddy. I don't take her fishing with me too often but she's done some back country camping trips and she was great, even in the canoe."

Great post Simon, not many things in this world better than a good & loyal pooch.  Just over a year now since  Marvin passed away, but there's not a day goes by that I'm not thinking of all the great times we had together for 18 years.  Thanks Lew, it's hard when you lose a pet, I lost my cat a couple years back, had Oscar for 20years! He looked like Garfield, acted like Garfield….heck….he was Garfield, except he was way less sarcastic and a real softy. His named changed when Jack was 1 year old, he decided the cat was to be called ""Moose"", and it stuck…..I also have fond memories of poor departed Moose….   OSCAR AKA ""MOOSE"" AND JACK……..THEY ARE FAMILY!              Awesome simon! Some great shots in there too.  Thanks Rick, liked your Facebook shots at the river too!    Great video Simon.

That's a great looking dog, Simon.  Thanks Cram, he gets plenty of exercise, running after the snow machine in winter and swimming all day in the lake at the bottom of our yard, DOG HEAVEN! (and people like it here too)     My dog is a horrible ice fishing partner, I'm hoping he will do better in the new boat when we get it.  I hear ya Freshtrax, He has gotten better on the ice, and shore fishing, he does not harass other people and will stay close by, in the boat though its HORRIBLE! Again he has gotten better, and perhaps a bigger boat would help (working on that one) but he is prone to wimping….and it drives me nuts!!!!! Will take him lots again this spring, force myself too so he can get more accustomed to it. He did ok last year at Lac seul for the whole day, but could do better.    Hes a lucky dog Simon! I miss my chocolate. Roloff is a lot like my new black lab. Spunky!! He lives for that ball, eh? LolS.  YUP! I swear he could chase that thing ALL DAY!    IMHO you can't beat a Lab and the chocolate Lab is the best looking in the bunch but I'm a bit bias.     That's awesome Mr.G, my buddy wants to train my dog for duck hunting too, lol….good luck with that!

That was a nightmare, had to drag him from under my truck like 4 times.  Overall he's good though, definitely likes going on long runs.  He is getting better, but sometimes he is very disobedient, he is not aggressive at all, which helps, only seen him growl with intent once, and that was last summer at camp and it took a whole day of being 'humped' by my friends dog to provoke poor Roloff, guess he got tired of being someone else's b!tch!     Great post Simon.  My Ralphie is my best bud too, but he does hog the blankets  Lol…poor little Ralphie, Roloff does not hog blankets, but he's heavy and makes it difficult to get comfortable when he's pinning me down and cutting off my circulation by lying on my legs."

One of her favorite things to do was when I would tune up all my reels in the winter I would clip my line on her collar and I would reel her in and then let her run pulling line. We would do it in the basement, I tried it outside once and she spooled me. No way I could stop 45 pounds of Staffordshire Terrier, no way."
907012,Mister G,2015-03-30 16:16:00,1429,"Most Labs don't take too much training to retrieve ducks, it's in their nature. Discipline on the other hand needs work especially when she sees them their ducks flying low. She wants to go get them even before I shoot them sometimes....LOL  But after 3 years of work she's a fine hunting partner and protector of our home. And she LOVES to go fishing. She knows when I get up early and start carrying out ice to the cooler and sees the boat hooked up that we're ""Going Fishing"""

907020,AKRISONER,2015-03-30 16:43:00,5558,"Its unfortunate, my dog loves fishing so much that he cant come in the boat while we are casting anymore, he just gets too pumped up. jigging for pickerels is one of his faves though.  You can bet any time i shore fish he accompanies me the entire way, he even likes to give a lick to every catch.  Some times its amazes me how good my pup's memory is. I was away on vacation the past two weeks so cash was at his grandmas house while I was gone. This morning my alarm went off at 6:45 like it does every morning, he still knew exactly what was going on and went immediately to the staircase and waited for me to get up so that I could take him for his morning walk.  Cash is definitely my fave person to hang around with, 100% loyalty at all times, and the only downside is that he has to be taken to the bathroom and I have to pick it up lol. He is so smart though that when i am at the lake, he rarely goes in the yard so I dont even have to pick up after him for the most part."
