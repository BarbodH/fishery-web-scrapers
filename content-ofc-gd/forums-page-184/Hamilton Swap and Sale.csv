Was a great day to see a lot of OFCer's wandering about. Had to have spoken to 30-40 members over the course of the day. I again apologize for not having salsa available but the new, larger, family has cleaned out my supply."
906713,Spiel,2015-03-29 01:18:00,9065,I forgive you Bruce. ?
906745,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-29 06:13:00,8243,"Great show. I really enjoyed the day and got a great deal on the line counter reel and Shimano Down Rigger rod I was in the market for. There were deals there for everyone. I did recognize a few fellow members and did get a chance to briefly say hello to Fish Farmer. He couldn't walk 5 feet without stopping to talk to someone, it was more like he was holding court with some of his subjects. I did finally get to see Christopher K and watched his fly tying skills. I think he was doing more teaching than selling. He actually looks younger in real life, didn't think that was possible, sorry I didn;t introduce myself, you were too busy at the time.  Old tired jealous guy."
906753,Fish Farmer,2015-03-29 13:11:00,2234,"As mentioned, it was a great turn out, better than any sports fishing show. I met so many people there that I didn't get to see much. I think thats why I go, just to shoot the crap, where can you go and meet so many fishing buddy's in one place. I got there a half hour early and the line up was almost out the door.   Didn't get to talk much to John, nice seeing you Johnny, as you said, met lot's of OFC members. Saw Bruce at his booth, and bought some of his lucky jigs,   HTHM Albert had to show me his great deal of a reel. Talked to Kelvin, had a big tackle bag he bought, talked about how many refreshments would fit in it  plus we should have taken our boats were selling to the swap, parked them outside with a for sale sign. Met (Spiel) Chris and Julie walking around, I couldn't believe he didn't buy one rod  he bought a big bag of spoons, but all the wrong color, I didn't want to say . Sorry Christopher K, I didn't see you. As I left, people were still coming in. I have to say a BIG THANK YOU to the Hamilton Bass Masters for putting on such a great Swap! Show! Fishing! Meeting. I had a great day."
906773,Loonietoon,2015-03-29 14:32:00,1450,"Was great to get over to the swap meet.. met with Bruce and his son as usual and talked a little, met with Chris(Spiel) and Julie, Albert and Dave. Yes bought a BIG TACKLE bag for tackle boxes  instead of carrying all my boxes, Big Tackle Bag for liquid tackle Did I Say That"
906788,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-29 15:39:00,8243,"Again a great show. If the OFC folks had name lanyards I would have met more members. And it is good for the site. Just a thought. Easily done as a common printable template could be provided here.  If someone is selling a boat that would be a great place to park it, great idea Dave. The show will be bigger next year I bet. The only thing that was not positive was there was not enough space. Some vendors had customers 3 deep at their tables. Carmen's or Michael Angelo's would be good rooms for the meet. Good highway access as well."
906791,mattaw,2015-03-29 15:55:00,162,"It was a nice show, good to meet a fair number of people from here! Bruce, it was good to have a table next to you and your son. I didn't leave with a ton, but definately happy with what I bought and sold.  The only issue with the show is it has me ready to go and drooling for soft water... Now we just need to fast forward time a bit!"
