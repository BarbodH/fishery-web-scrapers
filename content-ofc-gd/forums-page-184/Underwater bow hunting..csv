905990,Fisherpete,2015-03-25 21:26:00,1814,Only if you eat them.  Raw. And whole.     LOL
905992,grizzlybri,2015-03-25 21:34:00,565,"http://www.wideopenspaces.com/underwater-bowfishing-check/  This looks like a lot of fun.  Do you need your hunting licence to go bow hunting for carp?  Also can bow hunted fish be used for the OFC tourney?  according to the pdf version of the regs (page 15) bow and arrow for carp are as follow May 1-july 31 zone 5,6,9,10,12-16 ( except algonquin) 18-20 no limit  zone 17 is 2nd sat in may - july 31  Closed in 1-4, 7,8 and 11, zone 15 in algonquin  there is also regs on bow fishing for  bowfin and whiite sucker  So bow hunting for caarp in those zones is allowed so i don't see why it couldn't count for the OFC tourney  Only if you eat them.  Raw. And whole.     LOL  If he is doing it with me ther is a good chance one of us (me) will do that"
906003,Beavertail,2015-03-25 22:43:00,331,"No hunting licence required to bowfish carp, just a fishing licence."
906019,Musky or Specks,2015-03-25 23:33:00,2710,If your using a bow under water what's the difference between that and a speargun??
906020,manitoubass2,2015-03-25 23:46:00,11391,Its a little rediculous if ya ask me.  Shoot a carp with a bow from 3ft???
906030,Beavertail,2015-03-26 00:16:00,331,"Not only that, but I would never consider submerging my bow under water like that...unless it's a piece of crap in the first place. I'll stick to traditional bowfishing, it's plenty fun."
906035,Fisherpete,2015-03-26 01:07:00,1814,Nevermind the underwater business Jer. Get one of these bad boys!  OH WAIT - you would still end up underwater...
906038,Acountdeleted,2015-03-26 01:22:00,2562,"Haha. Pete, if I ever get one of those I'm going electrofishing."
906046,John Bacon,2015-03-26 01:57:00,3277,"Haha. Pete, if I ever get one of those I'm going electrofishing.  Electrofishing in an aluminum boat, that could get your heart to skip a few beats.., or maybe a whole bunch of beats."
906733,Fisherpete,2015-03-29 03:04:00,1814,Actually all the electrofishing boats I have seen ARE aluminum... Very similar to the one in that picture...
