907090,manitoubass2,2015-03-30 20:50:00,11391,Anyone catch this show?  I watched it last night for the first time and its pretty awesome hunting show.  Last night was red tail deer and buffalo.  I was very intrigued. I think its a new show but im not sure?
907178,Skud,2015-03-31 02:48:00,739,It has been out there for over a year or more but not many networks have picked it up. Too politically incorrect. Great show though
907181,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-31 03:46:00,8243,"I don't want to be teased about a meat that is not within my budget. I noticed the last few weeks our local Food Town has the cooler socked with guts. Always had liver in the display but now,  beef hearts, tongue, kidney, tripe. Eat and enjoy what you wish, but they never stocked guts before. $6.99 for ground beef, man oh man, time to do a drive by on a crew of cows. Enuff said."
907184,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 04:56:00,11391,"You gotta check out this show, the guy seems very knowledgeable and respectful.  I love the way he preps his kill, camps out and has a meal on the spot."
907187,Freshtrax,2015-03-31 05:18:00,2215,I caught one episode I liked it.   What network is it on?
907190,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 06:05:00,11391,Good question?  I think i caught it late last night on the outdoors network. Im not sure though?
907209,AKRISONER,2015-03-31 12:57:00,5558,"his episode hunting black bear in grizzly territory is nuts, the guy scales like 6 mountains and dodges grizzlies the whole time"
907226,bare foot wader,2015-03-31 13:48:00,1354,"he's one of the few hunting shows on TV I actually like...smart guy too, he did an interview with an anti and did well, respectful guy and made a good argument  the grizzly episode was awesome, smell us now lady!"
907234,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 14:02:00,11391,"How this show isnt on half dozen channels is beyond me?  he like the bear grylls of hunting, totally informative, very educating and respectful, and eats raw crap on tv.  i have to see the grizzly episode"

907242,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 14:32:00,11391,Saweeet!!!!  A bunch of them are on youtube?  Goodbye bandwidth lol
907263,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-31 16:15:00,937,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fbQgjlpjgo   That is crazy!
907267,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 16:33:00,11391,This guy is a good shot too!  That redtail deer was at 450 yards
907271,John,2015-03-31 16:49:00,2956,"With respect, a shot at 450 yards???? Too many variables and unknowns."
907273,manitoubass2,2015-03-31 16:59:00,11391,They showed the shot. It might be give or take but it was FAR.  Not only that he dropped it in one shot.  The man is a good shot
907276,bare foot wader,2015-03-31 17:12:00,1354,"With respect, a shot at 450 yards???? Too many variables and unknowns.  for average joe, yes.....but some hunters are completely competent and ethical at that range  youtube beats wildtv and the fishing channel hands down...here is another very well done video, just watched this morning  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs-mcWMew7g"
907510,green&orange,2015-04-01 17:26:00,31,"Steve Rinella is the guys name.  He is also an author.  I read a book of his about a buffalo hunt in Alaska called ""American Buffalo: In Search of a Lost Icon"".  Great read. "
