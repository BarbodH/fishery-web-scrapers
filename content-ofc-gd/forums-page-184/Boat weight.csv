906920,sneak_e_pete,2015-03-30 00:10:00,540,I have a 14ft princecraft superfisherman lx with a yamaha f20.  How much do you think the package weighs?  Also have a bow mount with 2 batteries.
906923,Fisherman,2015-03-30 00:21:00,7201,"F20 weighs about 111lbs, couldn't find the exact boat, but a similar one weighs about 200lbs. Batteries weigh about 60lbs each plus whatever the trolling motor weighs."
906928,Fisherpete,2015-03-30 01:00:00,1814,I would guess the boat itself weighs a bit more than that - my brothers bare bones 14' Legend is 325 lbs... Most of the 14' utility boats on the Princecraft site are also listed over 300 lbs.
906963,Weeds,2015-03-30 09:05:00,782,I think my ancient 14 foot springbok (prince craft) must weigh pretty close to 200.
