907293,Old Man,2015-03-31 19:04:00,822,"Personally, this is the only type I use. Maybe expensive but will out last and out perform any of the plastic crap out there. "
907307,NANUK,2015-03-31 20:15:00,797,"Do you know where I could buy one of them?  I tried taking the one I bought back, but of course they wouldn't take it because it's been filled with.... GASOLINE  lol. Thats Bull, How would you know it leaks unless you fill it with gasoline ? Where did you buy it from ? I would see the store manager and tell him it is illegal to sell a leaking gasoline container because that voids the CSA standards for such container. A big fire hazard. Should always be kept upright BUT Like mentioned above, you only fill it to 90% and it should not leak even when turned up side down That vent is there to open when pouring, NOT to leave it open during storage or transportation."
907321,Whitespinnerbait,2015-03-31 20:52:00,2038, Thank you Sir !!
907334,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-31 21:14:00,8243,I don't want to highjack this thread but I think my question is related. What is the largest portable gas container I can buy? I have what I think is 20 LT/ 5 gallons. As I will be transporting gas to the slip where I am going to have my boat I would like a few of the largest tanks I can get. I will use a dolly to get them from the truck to the boat. Also I scored a removable hose and nozzle so no one is lifting a  hundred pounds or so of fuel up onto the gunnel and then spill it all over trying to fill the boat.
907387,sofabed,2015-04-01 00:48:00,119,Canadian Tire used to sell 55LT containers. It comes complete with wheels for moving it around. I am not sure if they are still available

907473,Mister G,2015-04-01 14:47:00,1429,Sorry about that Drifter............those HD models look like a much better product. But I wouldn't want to handle the 110L model because once full it would weigh more then 200 lbs. My back hurts just thinking about it....LOL
907493,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-01 16:04:00,10439,Wouldn't be bad if you had a pickup with ramps.

906904,northernpike56,2015-03-29 22:40:00,717,"Has anyone had any experience with those military style gas cans? I just bought one because it seemed easier to store, but I filled it up with gasoline today and it leaks when I lay it sideways. The cap I'm pointing to is the one that leaks. Any suggestions on how to stop this? "
906908,NANUK,2015-03-29 22:55:00,797,"Thats a vent cap, it shouldn't leak when closed tight, If you just bought it new, any chance you can exchange it with another."
906909,Fisherman,2015-03-29 22:56:00,7201,"It's most likely that the plastic under the small yellow cap isn't 100% flat.  When you screw down the yellow cap, there's a bit of plastic preventing it from sealing.  Find an old piece of bicycle inner tube, cut a small round piece to fit inside the cap.  It should solve the problem."
906912,chris.brock,2015-03-29 23:18:00,4053,"Chinese products, good prices!  Just curious, why lay it down? A specific storage place?"
906913,Woodsman,2015-03-29 23:18:00,1286,Their not meant to be stored sideways. Store upright and problem goes away.
906922,bigugli,2015-03-30 00:20:00,6138,  Absolutely correct.
906925,spincast,2015-03-30 00:24:00,3279,"valid storage points aside  - get some saran wrap, double or triple fold it and put over the threads, then tighten. Limited to one or two uses per, but will do the trick."
906972,Mister G,2015-03-30 11:41:00,1429,There is no way you should be storing expensive gasoline in that jerry can on it's side. Gasoline is one of the most dangerous items stored in garages and every effort should be made to eliminate any leakage to prevent a fire / explosion.  Please be careful.

907041,DanD,2015-03-30 18:03:00,2223,"Regardless of the can's orientation, it should not leak. If liquid gas can leak from it, then fuel vapours also can. Gasoline vapour is much more volatile than when it's in liquid form. Take the can back and exchange it for one that does not leak; even if it's sitting on its head.  Dan."
907061,Mister G,2015-03-30 19:20:00,1429,Gasoline expands with temperatures and needs to vent.
907117,irishfield,2015-03-30 21:57:00,26272,"Better not tell that to the 30 cans of Avgas, that I have squeezed between my knees and tightened the caps down tight on !"

I didn't want to start anything; but if I had gas cans that were venting on their own, while in storage. Well lets just say, I wouldn't be the first one in the shop in the mornings to flip the furnaces on. LOL Not to belittle Mister G; yes you're right, they do have to vent; but only when you're pouring gas out of them. As for expansion, you should never fill a gas can any more than 90%; that 10% space will allow room for the expansion of the fuel.  Dan."
907128,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-30 22:17:00,10439,I picked one of those cans up last fall. It doesn't leak. Love the fact that they have a vent on them. The nozzle vented ones suck. My buddies in the US cry because they can only get crappy gas cans there because of California's rules.
907136,smitty55,2015-03-30 23:08:00,928,"I much prefer the vented cans than those newer ones. You can adjust the pour rate, plus you can pour from the vent for real small gas tanks with small caps.  I also agree with most others here. Tanks should not be stored on their side. All my gas cans are outside and I leave the vent slightly open. The only time it gets tightened  right down is during any transport.  Cheers"
907222,northernpike56,2015-03-31 13:43:00,717,"So everybody doesn't panic thinking I'll light my garage on fire: I was planning on always storing it upright (which it is right now), I wanted to put it sideways in the trunk of my car after I was at the shell station, so when I turned, it wouldn't fall over in the trunk. Upon realizing it leaked gasoline when tipped sideways, I just put it in the passenger side footwell of the car and held onto it with my right arm when turning so it wouldn't tip.  I also agree with hating those nozzle vented ones, I have one of the 20L versions of those and its absolutely terrible when its full lol"
