Might as well drag a line behind it while she's in the water. We were talking Grimsby, Jordan or Port Dalhousie launch. We really don't want to make the tow and find 4 feet of snow on the ramp. This is a great time to find fish shallow and a simple long line troll may do it.  Has anyone been out yet? Any launch recommendations? Any general fishing recommendations? I will call around i.e. Forans and 50 point, but at this time of the year I expect a voice greeting at the Marinas if there is even a phone number to call.  We will be taking a second boat in case of the worse case scenario. Might as well wet some lines.  Thanks all, PM me if you wish.  Johnny D"

907182,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-31 04:35:00,8243,"Hey Chris, my wife grew up in Queenston, a few hundred meters down the road from the monument. She made me promise never to go out on that river. I guess she lost a few friends to that river growing up. I will not fish that river and I know I'm missing some great fishing, but my promise is my word. 2 things you don't break for anyone, your Balls and your word."
907196,chris.brock,2015-03-31 11:10:00,4053,"I don't blame you. Crazy, nasty water down there for sure."

907210,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-31 12:59:00,8243,So what are you saying Roy?
907225,misfish,2015-03-31 13:46:00,29133,One of one thing and two of the other. Even I caught that one. LMAO
