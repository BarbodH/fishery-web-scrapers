906683,captpierre,2015-03-28 22:25:00,2521,Just got back from this long anticipated spring show It's HUGE!!  Packed and parking is scarce. You can pick from dozens of dock companies.  Lots of builders and suppliers.   Boats.  Seadoos. ATVs. But ya can't buy a Husky Jerk or even a jig ? What gives?
906687,irishfield,2015-03-28 22:35:00,26272,It's a cottage show.. not a fishing show. Out of my immediate 40 neighbours at the lake.. 3 fish!
