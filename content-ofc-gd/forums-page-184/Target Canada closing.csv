902897,Big Cliff,2015-03-11 17:42:00,6899,"Target Canada was a joke from day one! They opened stores with empty shelves and the stock they did have wasn't priced to sell.

902980,MJIG,2015-03-12 01:09:00,227,"Apparently Target or the liquidator, is over pricing the stock so that you are actually paying regular price when you get the 30% off.  someone at the Oshawa Target found a higher price sticker over top of the original price sticker, when brought up to the manager they were told to leave their purchases there and get out of the store.  Unfortunately, it sounds like it may all be deteriorating into a somewhat bitter parting of the ways, with both sides trying to get the most out of whatever remains. Target is trying to draw the most money it can from bargain-hunting customers, and these ""customers"" are going there in search of rock-bottom prices, many shopping there for the first time.  Target is pulling out, so there is no relationship left to salvage at this point. Buyer beware. It seems unlikely that anybody is going to come out a winner."
903152,pics,2015-03-12 23:52:00,1268,Target corp has nothing to do with the liquidation which is being handled by another company. I did go to 2 different stores today looking for a particular item. What was most interesting was the difference in prices between the stores for the exact same product. An outdoor wicker chair was $69 at one and only $32 at the other. The store with more stock was cheaper for some reason so I'm wondering how many other things are priced that way. Lindt chocolate bunnies had a difference of $1.75!!!

A business comes into Canada for the first time and builds / leases building putting people to work. Once the doors open they put many more people to work. Now I realize most are part time positions but not all and even the part timers are grateful they now have that job.  Then for whatever reason they can't make money and MUST liquidate in Canada because they have stock holders to answer to just like any other business. And now so many are glad they closed and can't wait to kick them out of the country. With that attitude how many more companies do you think will take the gamble to set up shop in Canada ?  I was never a huge fan of Target and can probably count the times there on one hand but I don't wish them or their employees ill will. Target is a retail store, don't take it so personal."

894310,Big Cliff,2015-01-26 19:03:00,6899,Steve I am truly sorry to hear about the layoff's. There are plenty of resources in place for the Target employees but what about all the support industries?  You have been there a long time so I am sure that if there is a cut back you will be one of the last to go but I do worry about all the young ones (as I know you do) that have gone out and bought houses and started families based on what they thought was a secure job.
896100,crappieperchhunter,2015-02-05 00:10:00,2582,Just an update for anyone interested. Our plant terminated 19 employees because of Target closing....which is about 20% of our staff.

The first thing done was to start cutting redundant positions in management. Area managers might as well visit the Zhers down the street the same day as visiting the drug stores in the same area.  Lets hope some of these jobs Loblaws are offering pay enough to allow a families quality of life to be maintained or at least be able to keep the Wolves at bay. I doubt there are any full time positions paying for benefits, those days are long gone. The ""X"" generation will be the first generation that will not be in a better financial position that their parents were at the end of their lives. There are some Baby Boomers that will or are not in a better position that our parents were at this point of our lives. We play now and pay latter unlike the previous generation."

The big thing is going to be what happens to all that mall space and all the little stores in the mall. It will be interesting to see if anyone steps in to take that over because without the space rented that mall can't survive."

892485,Big Cliff,2015-01-16 21:13:00,6899,Good thing! She probably wouldn't have wanted the job anyway.
892525,adempsey,2015-01-17 01:15:00,1498,"I went into a Target early tonight to spend a gift card and it was actually somewhat busy!  People are obviously looking for deals, but they aren't out yet."
892602,huzzsaba,2015-01-17 17:58:00,884,The color scheme of Target might be good for Canadian Tire to move in.
892678,Joey,2015-01-18 04:05:00,9122,"After listening to them build the new addition to the mall down the street for 6 months and being woken up by it every Saturday morning, I can't believe they wasted all that money building it only to close it down!!!!!"

892297,mike rousseau,2015-01-15 14:56:00,4661,"So it looks like target Canada has announced they're closing up shop...  17,000+ Canadians losing their jobs... Plus the effect on contractors that support the business...  One of their 3 distribution centers is in Cornwall where I live and my brother works there as an electrician...  This is a big loss for my city... And our country...  Sad news"
892298,SirCranksalot,2015-01-15 15:00:00,3291," This is a big loss for my city... And our country...  Sad news  Sad news indeed for your city, but I'm not sure about the whole country though. Surely other companies will supply the demand that Target was 'targeting'---maybe Cdn companies rather than an American one."
892299,adempsey,2015-01-15 15:11:00,1498,This is no surprise at all.   I cannot believe how badly operated the stores were.    The whole Target fiasco will undoubtedly be a chapter in many future Business 101 textbooks.  I do feel for all those who will be losing their jobs.  Hopefully their failure doesn't scare off any future retailers from setting up shop.
892300,Headhunter,2015-01-15 15:11:00,5703,"Target is a French company. Sorry to hear this news, but I figure that given the locations they have established here, another retailer will jump in. Question is, can folks wait for the jobs to come back? HH"
892301,chris.brock,2015-01-15 15:12:00,4053,"other companies like Walmart  Something is odd with Target Canada. The shelves are low on stock, they don't bring in new products, same crappy clothes for years, it still looks like K Mart and has hardly any people shopping like K Mart.  I feel bad for those loosing their jobs though. Hopefully they find better jobs."
892302,crappieperchhunter,2015-01-15 15:15:00,2582,Where I work we print all of there in store signage for ALL of Canada. When we got there contract we hired a bunch of people and spend tons of money on new equipment just to service them.  Many of our new hires are young kids with mortgages and young families. It's really going to have an impact on our workplace. Not looking forward to going in at 3 today for my shift.  That aside. It really was a dreadful flop. I went in the Lindsay store once and said to Debbe. There is nothing in this whole place price quality or uniqueness wise that would ever get me in here again.  But I have to say we did an OUTSTANDING job on there instore signage
892304,Roy,2015-01-15 15:26:00,13728,"Target is a French company. Sorry to hear this news, but I figure that given the locations they have established here, another retailer will jump in. Question is, can folks wait for the jobs to come back? HH  Target is an American company. Perhaps the confusion lies here:  Some people jokingly give Target the pseudo-French pronunciation /tɑrˈʒeɪ/ tar-ZHAY, as though it were an upscale boutique. This trend is incorrectly believed to have been started by Oprah Winfrey, when she used the French pronunciation to refer to the store on her television show, but has actually been traced back to 1962, the year the first Target store opened. Target once sold a line of shoes called ""Ms Targe""[62] this was reinforced by a 1980s television advertisement starring Didi Conn. This pronunciation has also led some people to incorrectly believe that the company is French-owned.[52] In recognition of the nickname's popularity and cachet, Target Corporation licensed its name and logo to Brand Central LLC in 2006, complete with accent over the letter ""E"", for a new line of clothing intended for more up-scale fashion customers. The line, ""Targét Couture"", was originally sold at Los Angeles-based store Intuition, which deals with high-end brands."
892306,mike rousseau,2015-01-15 15:38:00,4661,As a walmart employee... I'm happy  But my brother works for target...  So it's a bittersweet announcement for me
892307,asdve23rveavwa,2015-01-15 15:39:00,2690,"Sad to lose that many jobs.  As far as prices, and, stock.  Had two of my biggest scores ever last year in their camera section.  Nikon D3100 for less than half what Best Buy was/is charging for it...plus a Nikon point and shoot zoom for a similar deal. The D3100 after a further price drop was under $150. Should be some good deals during this closing."
892310,Ralph Field,2015-01-15 15:51:00,1018,I feel bad for all the families of all the workers that are affected by the closing. I agree with the TV reports that the store was under stocked and didn't carry the same quality of goods that their US stores carried.
892313,Headhunter,2015-01-15 16:12:00,5703,"I stand corrected Roy! Not sure why I thought they were a French company, but according to Snopes, they are headquartered in India. Can't say I have ever been in a store though! HH"
892315,moxie,2015-01-15 16:17:00,1566,The company my wife works for held their advertising contract here in Canada and will be affected in some way. As far as Target goes they tried to distinguish themselves from Wal Mart instead of mirroring their model as a bargain based outlet.  Maybe Target should have followed in step and changed their path to distinction once they had enough of the market.
892323,ketchenany,2015-01-15 16:54:00,3229,I worked on the pitch for their ad business. We didn't get it or we would be losing people today too.

892334,bigugli,2015-01-15 17:55:00,6138,"Based on last quarter showings in Canadian retail, Target is just one of a number of retailers that will be closing up. It was said some 2 years ago that the Canadian retail market was over saturated. Now that the economy is struggling, expect to see a major correction and a lot of empty stores.  A lot of people will be looking for work."
892335,Terry,2015-01-15 18:06:00,14456,well they did not live up to the hype stock and subsection were poor  what else did they think would happen  most of us see the US ads and thought it would be great to get some of those deals  seems they were higher priced then Zellers
892339,porkpie,2015-01-15 18:32:00,2521,"Sorry to hear of the job losses, but I am unfortunately not surprised.  The stores where empty."
892340,irishfield,2015-01-15 18:38:00,26272,Does this mean I'll get my Zellers store back.....  ... what a sad waste of billions of dollars and peoples jobs.
892345,ketchenany,2015-01-15 20:00:00,3229,"You may just get it, the name is still going, they had clearance  stores going not to long ago, The Bay owns the name. . . ."

892356,misfish,2015-01-15 21:29:00,29133,"The one they built here in Barrie is a huge building and it,s only been open here for I think 4-5 months. What a waste. Lose of jobs in Barrie is not good.  Maybe Sail will move in. One can only hope.LOL"
892362,mukluk,2015-01-15 22:58:00,196,First time I stepped into a Target store; I said to myself; self the shelves are poorly stocked and you could drive a transport truck down between  the aisles.  Prices were no bargain in my opinion.  Wish you luck on your endeavors.

892368,bigbuck,2015-01-15 23:36:00,2449,"They dropped the ball in a big way with distribution. Whoever was in charge of that should get the guillotine. Go a couple times to a half empty store and you will not waste more time going there. I feel for the employees, they were for the most part really helpful. Better than Wallyworld any day."
