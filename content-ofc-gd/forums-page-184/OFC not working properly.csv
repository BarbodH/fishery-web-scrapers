I go back to Firefox, disable Adblock Edge for this site in order for it to work properly. Pretty ""crafty"" programming to make sure we see all those fantastic ads."
906949,manitoubass2,2015-03-30 03:06:00,11391,Go on mobile. I dont see any ads. Looks pretty basic bit I dont come here for the green and beige layout

906951,irishfield,2015-03-30 03:23:00,26272,Knew I stayed loyal to IE for a reason!  Thanks Roy! It appears it's a thankless job...

906965,dave524,2015-03-30 10:00:00,4508,"Knew I stayed loyal to IE for a reason!  Thanks Roy! It appears it's a thankless job...  I use IE too , but for my Laptop I have to use google chrome only for this site to get the quote feature to work when posting. The laptop has a newer IE on it than the desktop where the quote feature is fine with an old IE. Never any  problem loading the page but I don't have an add blocker, one thing there is some overlap of the ad banners and thread topic on the member menu."
907053,NewHips,2015-03-30 19:00:00,111,Using Firefox with No Scipt.........wont open. they changed something on the website
907084,icefisherman,2015-03-30 20:30:00,952,"Yep something for sure must have been changed on the site....as I said I have used it for ever with Chrome, up until a week ago....and had AB for much longer than a week and site was working fine....so something fairly recent was done to to the site....also this is the only site I have this problem with. All the other fishing/hunting sites also use ads but I have no issue visiting them while having AB.  Thanks Roy, please see if you can sort this out.,  Worse comes to worst I'll just visit less frequent and only using IE for when I need to visit. Like Wayne I guess good I kept it even though I don't use it.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
907093,aplumma,2015-03-30 21:00:00,6896,"With all of the time that we put into keeping this site up and running and in some cases money from our own pockets. I take offense to some of the remarks posted here and the knife in my heart is that Roy is taking time from his REALLY busy world and apologies to people for all of the extra effort and time HE puts in to get I.T. things fixed in a timely manner. Come on folks lets be a little more giving to this site as well as the people who have given their time, effort and money so you all have a place to meet and greet. I will stop here but give your head a shake if you think this site is about making money.   A sad Art"

Thanks Norm, turns out it was my Adblock causing the problems like others have mentioned. I used my wife's tablet this morning and was able to log onto OFC and read this post.  Interesting as I installed Adblock a month ago and it's been working great until yesterday when I couldn't open the posts here, yet everything works fine on all the other sites I visit.  Disabled Adblock for this page and we're good to go."

906466,HTHM,2015-03-27 23:23:00,4082,I found that as of two days ago this site will no longer load if I have my ad blocking extension enabled. A bit of a drag for as I come here for the content not the advertisments.

Site hasn't opened for the past 4-5 days in Chrome....I too have AB but it has worked fine with it in the past so someone must have changed/done something to this site in past week or so. Hope it is corrected as I prefer using Chrome and don't want to disable AB.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
906906,Terry,2015-03-29 22:45:00,14456,"problem is you are asking them to help you  not see ads that pay for the site, their only means of making money to buy the bandwidth and software upgrades  I can't see them jumping on this problem they are most likely cheering"
906929,bigugli,2015-03-30 01:06:00,6138,"I understand completely the need to generate income to support the site. Most sites have the same problem. What I was told by some members yesterday, is they won't be taking down their adblocker. If they aren't viewing, the site still looses revenue revenue stream."
906938,Terry,2015-03-30 01:29:00,14456,"if someone would rather not come to the site then remove their ad blocker, that is their choice  that would be like saying I like the site and use it but I won't support it of course if they have never seen or clicked the ads then leaving changes nothing  and no loss of revenue"
