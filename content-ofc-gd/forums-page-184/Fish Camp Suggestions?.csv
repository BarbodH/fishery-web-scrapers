905905,netminder,2015-03-25 11:25:00,514,"It's about that time of year where my group of four looks into booking a fishing trip to the north. The main thing we want to target is walleye. We'd likely end up going sometime in July, although every year we say that's too late, but it's the best we can do due to work schedules.  It's a father/son excursion, and we've done this twice so far. The first year we went to a place near Chapleau which, in my opinion, turned out to be a fairly good fishing hole after some persistence and some much needed advice from the camp owner. The second year we went to a place near Matachewan and the fishing was a lot tougher, but that could have been due to a front that was rolling through at the time (my excuse). The place near Chapleau had nicer accomodations too (equipped with hydro, which was a definite bonus over the Matachewan place), but it's only downfall is it's about a 9 hour drive from our home base, which for at least one in the truck was too far. I think if we can find a place more in the 6 hour range, which probably cuts us off around 560/144, with decent fishing and livable accomodations we'd be happy this time (if it was up to me I'd go back to Chapleau, but I don't think it's my turn to decide).  Just so you know too, one of the guys is a definite non-fisherman, but that never stops him from catching the biggest fish of the trip. The rest aren't much better either but we kind of know the basics.  So, anyone have any advice on a semi-remote place they've been to lately? Any and all suggestions are welcome.  Thanks!"

905912,Gallie,2015-03-25 11:55:00,1215,"I have fished near matachewan and chapleau a few times and chapleau definitely has the edge on walters for sure, the montreal river system can be a tough go at times for more than just pickies. As for farther south im personally not familiar with any real consistent spots which is why i keep going farther north for my fish."

905924,Acountdeleted,2015-03-25 13:42:00,2562,If you can get to Ear Falls (west of Thunder Bay) Bluffy lake is top notch. The walleye and pike fishing is unreal and the owner Keith and his wife are some of the nicest people I have ever met. It's just a bit of a drive. (It is drive to)
905928,adempsey,2015-03-25 14:15:00,1498,"A a couple hours further than you want, but the drive should be part of the adventure!  http://www.horwoodoutpost.com/ (boat-in camp located in a great spot on Horwood Lake) http://www.red-pine-lodge.com/ (Ivanhoe Lake - make sure it's one of the waterfront cottages, they also have 2 boat-in outposts on the ""River"") http://www.air-ivanhoe.com/fishing-in-ontario-boat-ins.php (boat-in outposts on the Ivanhoe ""River"")  These are ~6 hours from you: http://www.ellenislandcamp.com/ (boat-in housekeeping camp on Lady Evelyn Lake) As mentioned, there are many places on Lac Kipawa as well.   I always wanted to try Two Moon Outpost Lodge, but there are at least a half dozen camps with good reputations.  Check out this post listing a large number of reports from the various lodges on Kipawa.  Also, if you're willing to extend the drive to about 10 hours, these two places (both owned by the same family I believe) are a bargain IMO. Especially if your kids are under16yo.  Happy Day Lodge  Prairie Bee Camps"

905962,rob v,2015-03-25 18:28:00,535,not sure where you are or how far a drive it would be but I'm going back to O'sullivan's rainbow on O'sullivan's lake near Geralton/Nakina again this year (4th trip).  Great fishing at a drive to lodge.   Accommodations are good and the camp owners are great.    We usually go in July/August and the fishing is always great - lots of walleye/pike/lake trout.    As far as I'm concerned anybody can catch fish here.   Might be a bit of a drive -but in my opinion worth every minute to get there.   http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/  Mike Borger referred us to this camp 4 years ago  and we very much enjoy it.
905968,Acountdeleted,2015-03-25 19:15:00,2562,Just drive across Superior and it's like 12.  No I know it's tough to get to. It's why I' have never been able to go back.
905976,SirCranksalot,2015-03-25 19:35:00,3291,Kipawa.  Lac or ZEC?
907213,north560,2015-03-31 13:18:00,38,Try Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge in Gowganda. Great walleye fishing comfortable boats.
907258,smitty55,2015-03-31 16:06:00,928,Another vote here for lake Kipawa. Many lodges to chose from. For more info check out the forums at http://www.kipawa.net/viewforum.php?f=1 and   http://kipawafishingforum.net/index.php.  Cheers
907270,Lunkerhunter,2015-03-31 16:47:00,455,been to horwood outpost on horwood lake and returning this year. awesome lodge and amazing lake  also been to lady evelyn about 6 trips now. also great fishing and many good lodges on the lake
907274,bigugli,2015-03-31 17:00:00,6138,You listed hwy 144 as a boundary.  Might try Ritchie's End of Trail. Great camp and plentiful pike and walleye. Biscotasi is a huge lake to discover.
907279,fishnsled,2015-03-31 17:46:00,3520,I'm sure that Mike can help you out with your needs.  A buddy of mine is pretty much looking at a similar trip as yours with his family. Mike had some great information and recommendations to suit his needs.  Some great suggestions by the others here as well.  I've always felt that half of the adventure was the drive up and back.  Never know what you'll see along the way.  I personally enjoy the drive to these destinations.
