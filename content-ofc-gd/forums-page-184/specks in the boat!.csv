I thought about strapping on the merc and takin er for a rip down the lake but figured it would serve us better as a heat source, so we sacrificed it via campfire to the brookie gods, and were rewarded with a modest bounty...    -18 this morning but my raccoon eyes tell me that spring is not far off.  Another 3-4 weeks of safe hard water fishing then the sled goes away...I hope!"
905883,chris.brock,2015-03-25 02:44:00,4053,Classic!  I'll give you $200 for the Safari to put towards your new Grand Caravan???
905884,4x4bassin,2015-03-25 02:45:00,1025,"Nice Joey , should of thrown a lick of paint on that boat and she would be good as new !"
905889,Nipfisher,2015-03-25 04:31:00,2449,Surprised the seat held him up.
905904,solopaddler,2015-03-25 11:17:00,8605,You guys are such rednecks - love it LOL!
905906,Joeytier,2015-03-25 11:31:00,3990,"I wanted to pull him around behind the safari in it to see how well it planed out, but we didn't have a strap.  Chris no caravans in my future!!"
905910,Rod Caster,2015-03-25 11:45:00,5784,"Redneck indeed. You'd never catch me doing stuff like that.  How big was that speck you filleted? Looks around 13-14"""
905918,Beavertail,2015-03-25 13:15:00,331,"Hilarious, looks like you guys always have a good time fishin. Those specks sure look tasty too!"
905921,SmokestackLightnin,2015-03-25 13:39:00,390,"I could be wrong and according to my wife that happens quite often but, those specks look like splake."
905942,Joeytier,2015-03-25 15:36:00,3990,They are natural specks.  Those fish had been laying out in the sun for hours.
905981,SirCranksalot,2015-03-25 19:53:00,3291,Would it take a 90 Merc do you think??
905987,Acountdeleted,2015-03-25 21:05:00,2562,"Man, I love this time of the year. Great report. Looks like a blast."
