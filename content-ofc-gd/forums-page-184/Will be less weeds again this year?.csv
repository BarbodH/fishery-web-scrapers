905427,captpierre,2015-03-22 21:16:00,2521,I cottage and of coarse fish North Pigeon Lake. Last  year weeds were way down compared to  the the previous years. Late spring. Fishing was pretty good. Likely be the same kinda year this year. Itchin to start. ?
905482,Regan Thompson,2015-03-23 00:16:00,80,I'm on Nipissing and we had the same last year.  Weeds were down and no one could find the fish!  This year will be very similar.  Last year the ice went out around April 1 and this year will be the same if not later.  This will affect the fishing for sure but if you know where to look you can find them.
905899,Mister G,2015-03-25 10:32:00,1429,"Weeds or no weeds, pry is your answer to finding fish."
905901,fishindevil,2015-03-25 10:48:00,6254,Well I would think so as the ice thickness is more than it was last winter as we had the coldest febuary and less snow cover in many areas so I guess it would depend on where you are in the province ?? But in the kawarthas I would say yes and in Haliburton on some lakes I fish the weeds took a serious hit  and they were very late Comming up and were killed off earlier as well from cold water !!! We were accualy discussing it with the MNR back in the fall in Haliburton as well  so I guess we will find out !!! Less weeds makes some baby fry way more vulnerable to predators and less food !!!! It goes on & on !!!! Time will tell
905903,ecmilley,2015-03-25 11:01:00,2163,Less ice on sturgeon this year than last though its still completly froze so really untill break up hard to say weeds will be late for sure but so will the spawn. last year side imaging helped me find some weed beds that helped me limit out early instead of burning fuel all day looking
905926,Sinker,2015-03-25 13:57:00,8692,"We'll never know until the ice goes out. We could get a hot, dry, summer with no wind and be choked with weeds yet.  S."
905953,jimmer,2015-03-25 17:09:00,2730,The weeds were thick enough in the lower end of Pigeon Lake last summer.
905959,JoshS,2015-03-25 17:42:00,729,Probably hard to tell now. I heard complaints about the lack of weeds or late weeds last year. But I kinda liked the less weedy situation last season for some spots.
905960,BillM,2015-03-25 17:45:00,17367,"I agree, it's way too early to tell."
905978,mattaw,2015-03-25 19:39:00,162,"It could be weedy, it could not be. As others have said, to early to tell. Relax and wait, nothing we can do about it."
905980,SirCranksalot,2015-03-25 19:47:00,3291,Less weed?? Maybe the price will jump?? I'd better phone my BC contact ASAP!
906016,Gregoire,2015-03-25 23:31:00,1397,"The weeds were thick enough in the lower end of Pigeon Lake last summer. Aren't the weeds always thick on Lower Pigeon?  I know the musky were in different locations on Pigeon last year, but once we located them they seemed to be much bigger."
906017,manitoubass2,2015-03-25 23:32:00,11391,???
906688,chris.brock,2015-03-28 22:40:00,4053,Hopefully the spawn and recruitment are good this year but I have a feeling these last 2 years aren't good and we will notice it down the road.  I think the walleye will be on fire again for the first 2 or 3 weeks though this year. Just me and my crystal ball's guestimate.
906765,Moosebunk,2015-03-29 13:34:00,3970,"Predicting a softwater fishing season here in Ontario.  Complete with lakes, fish and yes... probably some weeds here or there in those lakes and on or around some fish.  Just noticed ""citiot"" above Chris's avatar and lost any train of thought.  Just giggling about it now.  Gotta get a coffee."
