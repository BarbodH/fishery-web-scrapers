907001,moxie,2015-03-30 15:23:00,1566,"Use them almost exclusively dropshotting and have done very well with them but like anything that may leave a hole to be filled, it will be filled. I was already eyeing Jackalls Cross Tail Shad before I even heard heard the X-Zone news."
907017,Dan668,2015-03-30 16:30:00,1120,"For dropshotting powerteam jp hammer shad are good. My favourite are the crosstail shad. Prefer both to xzone. Even for the swammer, there are better alternatives imo"
907054,adempsey,2015-03-30 19:09:00,1498,There are plenty of great baits out there.You could always make your own too![media]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYLSpQ30Rxs[/media]
907063,musky_hunter,2015-03-30 19:30:00,328,"here is what's left at pro j, a guy came in and bought a few handfuls today. LOL.  Swamers  Slammer + Leeches  X-Stick "
905443,Dave Bailey,2015-03-22 22:20:00,1641,"From their facebook page today:   I have no idea what happened, but Mark and his product will loom large in fishing legend for a long time to come."
905490,adempsey,2015-03-23 00:37:00,1498,Very unfortunate.  The company seemed to be doing well from my consumer perspective.  It had a great reputation and I saw the products at almost every tackle store I went to.    I guess the tackle business is just that tough.
905520,mattp33,2015-03-23 04:52:00,290,"They were for sale, did anyone buy them?"
905560,206,2015-03-23 16:02:00,563,"A quote Mark Kulik Thanks so much for the overwelming show of support guys! I am proud of what we accomplished how many Canadian companies can say so many Elite anglers use their brand! -Its simply too much for us right now -not getting younger and have decided my health and my family are most important! I'd like to thank my wife Jenny for her tireless work on Xzone over the years -havnt always told her how much I appreciated the help! so much more to running this than it seems!  Anyone suggest the best colors, Maybe grab a few packs before they are gone."
905567,BillM,2015-03-23 16:36:00,17367,It's too bad someone like Pure fishing couldn't have bought them out.
905569,Lunkerhunter,2015-03-23 17:18:00,455,good luck finding the best colors. they are sold out everywhere. I have been stocking up for weeks and so have many others. hahaha
905571,manitoubass2,2015-03-23 17:36:00,11391,"Is it that hard for someone with the original product to make a mold? Or was this some next level super secret plastic?  Ive heard nothing but great things about the company, owner and product. Such a bummer it goes down."
905628,Dave Bailey,2015-03-23 22:31:00,1641,"I'll be using mine, but any fish that destroys one will get a very stern talking to."
905637,bigugli,2015-03-23 22:41:00,6138,  At the very least boiled in oil sounds like an appropriate punishment. Lol
905646,John Bacon,2015-03-23 22:51:00,3277,  At the very least boiled in oil sounds like an appropriate punishment. Lol  Breaded then boiled in oil... they won't do that again.
905652,mattaw,2015-03-23 23:11:00,162,"I stocked up as much as possible, but I'm sure there are good alternatives out there. Shame to see such a great company gone though"

905725,mike rousseau,2015-03-24 06:06:00,4661,I bought a bunch last year... It's a smoke/purple/something/something.... They work great... Also any browns with flake worked good... Usualy it was a goby color or a shinner color
905740,ecmilley,2015-03-24 11:42:00,2163,still have 30 bags of slammers and maybe 4 bags of swammers but completely out of pan slammers which were my got crappie bait
905751,musky_hunter,2015-03-24 13:43:00,328,pro j still has lots of xzone products.
905793,JoshS,2015-03-24 18:23:00,729,Still haven't found a swimbait I like better in the bigger size. I stocked up on what I could find but now I'm scared to put a hook in them!  I have a whole graveyard of ripped swammers at home with plans on repairing them one day. I tried to meld them back like you would with a bulldawg but doesn't work well with swammer plastic. Anyone have success repairing them?

I was skeptical, Maybe I'll go rip a Xzone and try it to let ya know how it goes."

I was skeptical, Maybe I'll go rip a Xzone and try it to let ya know how it goes.  I use mend it.. It works ok for small tears or any place the hook doesn't go. Any split on the head where my jig goes needs something greater. I've had a bit of success melting them back but it doesn't work that well with the swammer plastic. Oh well... Hope someone resurrects those molds one day or better yet makes one in the 7in range (big pike couldn't resist). Maybe it's just me but for some reason fish like that swimbait more than others."
906130,mike rousseau,2015-03-26 18:15:00,4661,I was just at fence depot in Cornwall Ontario and they have a full stock of x zone products... Minus my favorite color slammer... Lol  One of the workers also told me the products will still be made but under a new name...
906131,fishdawg,2015-03-26 18:27:00,912,Grimsby Tackle is blowing out remaining stock.

906946,bigugli,2015-03-30 01:43:00,6138,"There was a lot of XZone product at the show and swap yesterday, fetching a good price too. There will probably be some available at the North Toronto swap and sale."
