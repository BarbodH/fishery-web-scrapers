I've searched online, and found that they're closed? Just wondering if anyone else has any updated information? I'm hoping they've either re-located or are still at that location?  Here's that link I found...  http://www.lakesimcoemessageboard.com/forums/index.php?topic=11275.0  Thanks all and tight lines!"
