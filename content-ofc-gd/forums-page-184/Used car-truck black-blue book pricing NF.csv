When we go to pay the taxes,change ownership,plates etc.Does the bill of sale you have from the seller hold any weight?or is it strictly a number you pay from the pricing books and you pay taxes on what they believe is fair market value?Hearing all kinds of mixed opinions.Anyone know for sure?,Thanks.   Dave."

Thanks guys for the info.   Dave."
906584,BillM,2015-03-28 15:33:00,17367,"They pick the higher of the two, what you paid or the book value."
906598,JoshS,2015-03-28 16:06:00,729,"I've bought three used cars and paid tax on the bill of sale twice and book value the other time. My first car we wrote up the bill for ""$1"" and I ended up paying tax on the book value. My jeep got written up as $2.5k, book value was 5, and I paid tax on the 2.5k. My current car I paid tax on ""$7k"" even though the retail book value was way more.  If you buy a car ""as is"" ... why should you have to pay tax on the book value when the car isn't worth that ""as is""? So you spend a few bucks and fix it up, you should still pay tax on what you paid for the car. That said, makes sense for the rules to say you have to pay tax on the greater of the two values considering how you can write up a bill of sale for anything you want.  Think it really depends on who's working that day at Service ON."
906617,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-28 17:06:00,8243,"My father ""gifted"" my niece a very nice vehicle. She paid taxes on MOT blue book value which was less than the appraised value. Apparently she could have shown  the appraised value on her income taxes but I don't have the specifics on how that works. In my experience you are at the mercy of the person at the Ministry behind the counter. I was told by a ministry clerk who dated  a pal, never do business with them on a Monday morning or Friday afternoon. She said the best time is just before lunch, they want to keep it simple and whatever is easiest for them."
906623,irishfield,2015-03-28 17:30:00,26272,"Your niece shouldn't have paid a dime! A vehicle can be gifted from a Grandparent for free, nothing needed but a sworn statement that any town clerk or notary public can sign for you. Did same with my Mother's car to my nephew when she passed away on 2009."

907170,smitty55,2015-03-31 01:53:00,928,"It must have to do with the age of the vehicle. I transferred a '96 Park Ave today. There was no book value in the database so I paid $65 on the $500 receipt. Plus that Bull $20 ""search"" charge and a $14 transfer fee. Call it a C note.  Cheers"

It's very nice for my parents to bequeath their hard earned money to the grand kids but a 25K vehicle because she needs a car to get to university and home. I suggested they get her a $5000.00 car and put 20K in a secret account for when she is in a position to buy property. |That 25 K car 4 years ago is worth what 7 or 8 thousand now."

Man the taxes that are paid are enormous.If she would of kept the truck,you get a extra year.WTH.Tax grab or what.  While it is total Bull and a scam.... It isn't really a tax grab, because the Ontario guberment only gets a nominal set fee from the garage for each test they do and 7% of the 30.00. What is strange is that Harper takes his cut of 6% and we know he DOESN'T even pretend to care about the environment LOL.  The biggest reason why they make you do a test when you buy a vehicle that has a valid one is simple... It PROVIDES a steady of source of revenue for the garages who do the testing to pay for the equipment... If that requirement was dropped it would mean that many fewer tests to do. So how many garages would have said NO THANKS to paying staff to upgrade to the new system and buy the equipment? I know a couple of garages who dropped out of the program citing the cost to buy into it just wasn't worth the cost to change over.... Of course the garages have always made their real money when you failed and they can charge you another 49.99 to 125.99 just to tell you what the codes WERE that made you fail. Then they start diagnosing for even more money.  I would bet that the government actually takes in even less tax money overall now with the OBDll test than it did before. The reason being if you have no check engine lights or if you are still worried and bought a 5.00 OBDll doggle off of Ebay for your smart phone you KNOW you are going to pass.  So if you are smart, and don't see a CEL you don't go do an oil change you might not have needed mileage wise, replace the air filter, fuel filter if you can, do a sparkplug, wire change and then run through a tank of PREMIUM fuel like lots of people used to do EVERY time before the sniffer test. Because they really had no clue if they would pass or not.... So a few basic preventative measures seemed wise."
