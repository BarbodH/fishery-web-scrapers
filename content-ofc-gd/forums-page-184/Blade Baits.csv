I do own a few by Heddon, Cotton Cordell and Reef Runner, but was wondering if anyone had a preference for a certain bait.  Also, I've seen some really large versions (about 6"" long) for Lake Trout fishing.  Anyone use those before?   I know they make some for Musky as well.  ."

906802,kickingfrog,2015-03-29 17:04:00,8333,Any ideas on those big blade baits in Ontario? Or will I need to ship from the states?
