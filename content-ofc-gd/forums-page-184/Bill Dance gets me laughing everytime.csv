906732,Dave Bailey,2015-03-29 02:57:00,1641,DAD GUMMIT!
906735,Paudash,2015-03-29 03:19:00,273,the best show I ever saw with him was him in a 21 ft bass boat in a pond that could not have been more than 100 yards by a 100 yards  he was a classic
906739,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-29 03:48:00,937,Haha...classic
906805,bigbuck,2015-03-29 17:33:00,2449,"Fish enough, long enough and most of those things WILL Happen to you. Good one Lew!!"
906806,Rizzo,2015-03-29 17:35:00,4754,"if those are not staged he is definitely the clumsiest, dumbest person on earth."
906807,lew,2015-03-29 17:38:00,12766,"Fish enough, long enough and most of those things WILL Happen to you. Good one Lew!!  I hafta admit I HAVE backed my boats into the water with the rear tie down straps still attached....twice.  And one of the times was at the Old Church ramp on Hay Bay with about 8 people watching me"
906809,manitoubass2,2015-03-29 17:41:00,11391,"Man he must have had the best sponsors ever.  Some of the things I think are staged, some I think are him just being his clumsy self.  In some clips he gets pretty heated over breaking rods etc"
906810,misfish,2015-03-29 17:46:00,29133,All staged but still good for a laugh    Thats what Terry always says to. LOL
906812,Terry,2015-03-29 17:51:00,14456,hey what the hell does that mean  you made me sit in the broken seat on your boat
906813,misfish,2015-03-29 17:52:00,29133, I too halfta admit I have done the same and the transom saver was still on. To much of a hurry.LOL
906814,misfish,2015-03-29 17:53:00,29133,hey what the hell does that mean  you made me sit in the broken seat on your boat  You did make me LAUGH.
906817,Rattletrap2,2015-03-29 18:10:00,1652,"Guys, as long as all those mishaps don't happen to ya on the same trip.......it's all good! I think we have all been there.....some more than others! lol Launching with the tie down straps still attached is a given that will happen to you sooner or later."
906973,Mister G,2015-03-30 11:45:00,1429,I see him differently.......a buffoon that makes boat anglers look bad.
906976,Beavertail,2015-03-30 12:11:00,331,"Staged or not, definitely entertaining. The loose trolling motor is great. Taking the trailer hitch off the shin is something everyone has done for sure too. I just could never understand why all he ever fished for were Largemouth??? Still don't get it."
906977,Mister G,2015-03-30 12:23:00,1429,"Staged or not, definitely entertaining. The loose trolling motor is great. Taking the trailer hitch off the shin is something everyone has done for sure too. I just could never understand why all he ever fished for were Largemouth??? Still don't get it. Because once he built his private lake/POND that's the only place he now fishes. Like shooting fish in a barrel by a buffoon."
906978,bigcreekdad,2015-03-30 12:23:00,546,"I would bet many of these are not staged. Frankly, I don't think Bill is that good an actor."
907268,OhioFisherman,2015-03-31 16:38:00,6623,"Staged or not, definitely entertaining. The loose trolling motor is great. Taking the trailer hitch off the shin is something everyone has done for sure too. I just could never understand why all he ever fished for were Largemouth??? Still don't get it. Money? It was his job? He is 75 now, if he can still earn a check fishing in his own pond? More power to him! People like Bill Dance, Rowland Martin, and others had a lot to do with starting the bass fishing craze, nice to see they got a bit of a reward for it?"
907467,Headhunter,2015-04-01 14:30:00,5703,"I cringe every time I see hit whack his shin on that trailer hitch. It's like I can feel it... ouch. That said, the guy simply cracks me up! Thanks for the reminder Lew... HH"

Not sure why there is always someone who has to hate on successful people. Pretty easy to do it from your couch while these people are out there doing something."
907538,manitoubass2,2015-04-01 19:43:00,11391,Imagine what hasnt been filmed if he cruising his own pond in a 21ft bass boat???  hes probably hit the ejector seat a few times dry docking his boat lol
