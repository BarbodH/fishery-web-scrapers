541027,Radnine,2011-01-18 21:48:00,1538," I just purchased a ""Cadillac Rods"" a St Croix Legend (the one with the gold plated strike indicator on it) for $50 (rod only). It lasted one day before the end guide, complete with gold plated strike indicator, fell clean off! Note, that's fell off, not broke off. St Croix service offered to waive the return shipping charge from the service centre, and told me which glue to use if I wanted to glue it back on myself. Big of them eh? To recap: 100% of the St Croix ice rods that I have purchased have been defective. It has since been returned to the retailer from which it came, and the name St Croix is never to be spoken in our house again. The Rapala R type rod/reel combo looks like a neat little unit. Fishing World in Hamilton has a great ice fishing selection if that is close to you. Good luck! Jim"
541033,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-18 22:01:00,0," not to negate that they were defective (which is total bull for a 50 dollar rod), but a loose tip top is a pretty minor defect and would take all of 20 seconds to repair."
541034,limeyangler,2011-01-18 22:01:00,5204,"the perfect rod on a budget for those species is $14 at Walmart...its kinda orange color, fibreglass tip/blank. The reel is junk as it comes as a combo....use a softwater reel you most probably already got...and your set."
541063,irishfield,2011-01-18 23:20:00,26272,"I bought the ""Ice ??"" rod at CTC.. handle and three different rod blanks you can slip in. I use the heaviest rod and still use the cheap reel that came with it for Lakers. Hasn't let me down yet! $19.99 Don't see any reason to spend anymore on equipment that takes the abuse of ice rods."
541079,Rich,2011-01-19 00:10:00,3927," I'm sorry but I can't agree with that in the case of fishing rods.. I definitely need to FEEL it before I buy it, or I certainly won't know if it's what I want!"
541092,Radnine,2011-01-19 00:34:00,1538," I am not sure how you can get the point on one hand and completely ignore it on the other. There was a bin full of rods for $5.00, but I couldn't have one of those 'cause they're not good enough! So I pay 10 times that amount for a name brand, quality rod and it falls to pieces before my eyes a day later (while I was showing it to a buddy). If the rod falls to pieces in any way (regardless of how easy those pieces are to glue back on) it is an epic failure. The quality is all that I was supposed to have paid for!! If nothing else, tell me that you recognize the irony of it. The only acceptable response from St Croix would have been ""We are extremely sorry sir for the trouble we have put you through. We have shipped today, a new rod as well as one for your friend. Please also find enclosed a St Croix toque to keep you warm while you use your new rod, with our compliments. In the mean time rest assured that we are looking into our manufacturing processes to make sure that this problem does not re-occur."" What I got was ""Here, Clem, use the crazy glue"". You can spend $50 for a do-it-yourself project if you like, but I will not. Jim"
541146,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-19 02:06:00,0," as stated, i get the point.  you bought a product, and it was defective so the liability should be on st. croix to make you happy.  some people would rather fix the rod and be done with it than wait a few weeks to get a new one! that's all i was getting at!"
541151,Old Man,2011-01-19 02:21:00,822,"I've got a couple of medium action Rapala Ice Rods that are good, but apparently they're not making them any more."
539299,4x4bassin,2011-01-14 15:11:00,1025,I'm in the market for a new rod and have a couple questions. I don't get out much so I don't need anything fancy (save that for soft water) Where would be the best place to start looking and what should I be looking for ? I will be going after lake trout/pike/whitefish so I imagine I would need something a little heavy.  Thanks
539301,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 15:14:00,2690,"Can't go wrong with a medium, medium/heavy St.Croix."
539304,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 15:19:00,2690,"Should probably elaborate, on that a bit...I prefer the Premier, 24 or 28"" in a hut...can go longer if fishing outside."
539305,LucG,2011-01-14 15:21:00,779,"Here's a few tips for you...  Don't buy a rod that come with line allready on the spool. Theres no way of telling how long that line has been on there, and often leads to a tangled mess due to its memory.  Watch out for some of the cheaper reels with, usually with only one bearing. They usually have low quality grease in them as well. These two factors usualy lead to a stiff reel in cold weather.  Make sure you chose a rod that suites the species your fishing. Alot of the lower end rods are all med-hvy. If your targeting pan fish, an ultra light rods is key.  Hope this helsp when chosing your rod/reel.  Good luck"
539310,4x4bassin,2011-01-14 15:28:00,1025,"I have a reel already so i'm just looking for a rod , I got a set up for christmas but took it back (too light for lake trout, they would turn it into a pretzel) so the search is on !"
539328,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-14 16:01:00,0, best cheap rod for the purpose you describe i can think of...  nice long laker rod... http://www.frabill.com/rods-reels/rods/ice-hunterr-series-jeff-gussy-gustafson-38-heavy-duty-ice-rod.html
539433,torco,2011-01-14 19:57:00,656,last weekend canadian tire had all there ice fishing rods on half price. There was nothing spectacular but some decent ones for half price. So you keep an eye out for a sale.
539446,Rod Caster,2011-01-14 20:46:00,5784,"I just bought the Graphite GS Series ice rod from BPS. $22.  It's longer than your typical ice rod with a better backbone. The best thing about it is it doesn't have the rubber stoppers to hold the reel in place...those drive me nuts, this one has the screw type clamping system.  To complete the combo I bought an Abu Garcia Cardinal 101i reel. Big enough to use in the summer, small enough to use with the ice rod and the quality is high enough to avoid stiff reeling  in cold temps. $35 at BPS"
539728,Rich,2011-01-15 15:55:00,3927,"I've got cheap HT ice rods, the expensive, longer jigging rods, tip-ups, ice lightning rods and ice ugly stiks.  Ice fishing doesn't variate too much. With the exception of my much heavier pike rods, any of those other rods can substitute for another. Go with what feels good in your hand at the store!"
539828,pidge,2011-01-15 20:43:00,438,I've got problet the cheapest of the cheap. Its an Ugly Stick and has served me well. You said you dont get out ice fishing much so I wouldnt go crazy with those cadilac rods and save your money for some extra jigs.
539841,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-15 21:42:00,2690," The nice thing about ice fishing is the ""cadillac rods"" are still cheap.  But, I know what you are saying."

539847,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-15 22:15:00,0,"thorne bros are real nice and all, but i'm not sold on the price tag.  i built very nice ice rods on 10 dollar blanks from mudhole.  i use a thorne bros rod tube to protect it though!"
539852,Familyfisherman,2011-01-15 22:39:00,188,"Heck of a quote Doc...I had to read it 3 times  I use an ugly stick, 28 and 32 inch med and med heavy with a softer tip.  Works well for whities and lakers -- caught one at 21lbs last year and it was fine.  Obviously your reel will be decent.  You're only going to buy one, so don't go on the cheap.  Consider medium to medium heavy, ensure the tip is sensitive enough for light bites, and get a screw in reel seat and cork handle...also ensure the eyes aren't too small, they ice up like crazy.  Avoid the rods that are too thin...they aren't very forgiving if you bump them around a bit...""snap"""
539855,BillM,2011-01-15 22:58:00,17367,"I run a pair of Rainshadow XST ice rods this year that my rod guy up in OS did up for me.  Nice cork work, great wraps for about $50 a pop.  No complaints here and they beat anything I've seen."
539863,GoneFishin,2011-01-15 23:59:00,349,I haven't found many nice ice rods. I won't buy them paired up with the reels because the drags on those reels almost always suck. I tried a premier but it was way to soft and the fibers cracked and the rod broke. Has a warranty but.. The avid feels a little better I might pick one up but for like 10 bucks more that custom rod that BillM mentioned sounds like a good idea.
540101,4x4bassin,2011-01-16 17:43:00,1025,"Thanks for the tips guys, where do you think I should start my search for the best selection ,BPS,LeBarons. I'm going on Monday. Thanks"
540159,Rod Caster,2011-01-16 21:09:00,5784,I wasn't very impressed with the selection at BPS but I did find one I liked....never been to LeBarons.
540264,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-17 00:58:00,0,buy online.. get exactly what you want!
540272,walleyemaster,2011-01-17 01:09:00,325,"I like to use the shortest thickest rod i can find when on simcoe i have one made by lakeland, this rod is heavy and short with big eye holes so they never freeze up.. i use this rod strictly on simcoe the reason being when i have a fish no one can tell that i have one on and then no one can crowd me.. most of the time when someone has a fish on, people move in to fish close to them sometimes too close, almost in their hole.."
540335,Shelley Cooper,2011-01-17 03:16:00,394, I have that same set up.. I love it.. enjoy!!
540792,adempsey,2011-01-18 05:47:00,1498,"The selection at Le Baron (Markham) and BPS is pretty poor at the moment.   Although, the last time I was at BPS they did have a lot of their own brand of rods and some baitcaster St. Croix rods.  They BPS brand rods are the longer ice rods (like 36-42"" or something) - new trend I guess.  I'd check JB's Fishing Depot (near 401/Belfied), they carry St.Croix rods.   The Jason Mitchell rods (recently purchase by Clam corp) seem popular, but never used one.  If you don't want a St.Croix, then I would agree with ordering something online.  Good luck."
540882,Dan668,2011-01-18 15:20:00,1120,"To the members who made custom ice rods, which blanks did you use.. I'm looking to make one for lakers and whities, not sure on what length to get."
540892,troutologist,2011-01-18 15:47:00,951,"I've been using a 40"" Thorne Bros Walleye Sweetheart MH for lighter baits like buckshots and smaller tubes.  Also use a 40"" Thorne Bros. glass predator rod for bigger plastics and traps.  Their not the cheapest but awesome rods and built, with the components I wanted. The extra length is key if you're taller and fish outside...less line above the ice for wind to catch and kill sensitivity."
540905,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-18 16:01:00,0,"i used the cheap ice blanks on mudhole.com it's a 39"" solid glass medium action."
