I was planning on going this sunday but heard that the walleye fishing is very slow at this time and picks up later. Any validity to this?  Also, where are they located at different periods of the hardwater season?  Thanks a lot guys!  Any other information on lake trout location would be greatly appreciated as well! Thanks again  "
