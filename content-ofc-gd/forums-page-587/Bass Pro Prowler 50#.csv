The Cabin fever flyer has a 50# bow mount prowler at what seems to be a great price, but I'm having a hard time finding any reviews on this unit.  I'll be using it on a 16' tinnie, it probably won't be used too hard, I want it mostly just to steer the boat as I drift or for hugging the shoreline in calmer water.  Any advice would be appreciated.  On a side note, anyone getting or giving BP gift cards be sure to keep the receipt.  I checked the balance online for a few that I got at Christmas and one shows $0 so I called the 1-800 number and they told me that the retailer didn't activate it properly and the only way I can get that done is to bring it back with the receipt.  A receipt that of course no longer exists..."
