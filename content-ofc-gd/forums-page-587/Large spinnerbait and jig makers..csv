539059,mercman,2011-01-13 23:29:00,7054,I'd be interested in hearing the answer to this also. Since i seem to have way too much time on my hands in the winter and would like to make my own jigs.
539073,Leecher,2011-01-14 00:01:00,7832,Sorry Roy but can't help ya in that department but hope this bump get's someone to chime in Jacques
539077,Roy,2011-01-14 00:05:00,13728,Thanks guys.
539079,bare foot wader,2011-01-14 00:10:00,1354,"I've tied a few 2oz spinnerbait heads in my fly vise with the saltwater jaws swapped in, no problem...i'd think that any vise with optional saltwater jaws would work...prior to that vice grips or pliers in the bench top vise worked just fine for me"
539081,Roy,2011-01-14 00:13:00,13728,Right now I'm using a regular bench vise but it's big and awkward. I'll talk to Marc Thorpe in the morning. He makes a good batch of them every year for his own use.
539083,muddler,2011-01-14 00:15:00,623,Ok I'll chime in first. I tie a lot of jigs in the 1/2 down to 1/32 oz. I use a Cabelas knockoff of the spring loaded Regal vise. Works like a charm. For the size that you mentioned above the hook size would be way too big to fit even my saltwater vise. The biggest hook size that I've used is a 1/0 in a spinnerbait.  What might work well is a pair of visegrips to hold the hook and then clamp the handle of the visegrip to your tying bench.  muddler

539123,Joey,2011-01-14 01:52:00,9122,"I use the vice from Luremaking.com, it works pretty good, but I don't have anything to compare to so....."
539126,Roy,2011-01-14 01:55:00,13728,"Thanks again guys.... and Joey, I'll have a word with Steve at Luremaking and see what he has."
541670,aplumma,2011-01-20 22:24:00,6896,Roy here is a vise I finally figured out were I had seen it. It looks like whatyour looking for.  LOWES vise link
541673,craigdritchie,2011-01-20 22:35:00,1586,"Never used it Roy, but this looks like it might do the job. Hope you're well financed though!!  My link"
