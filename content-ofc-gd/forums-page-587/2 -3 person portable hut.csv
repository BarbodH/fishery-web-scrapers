539047,danbouck,2011-01-13 23:06:00,4380,Looking for a 2 or 3 person portable. Are there any on sale right now anywhere? Did a search but came up empty.  BTW I am CHEAP!!!
539051,Jer,2011-01-13 23:15:00,1426,"Best deal has been at Costco, $180 bucks for a ""3"" man (better for 2) pop-up. Most stores will be sold out this season though."

539110,Rizzo,2011-01-14 01:23:00,4754,I just bought one through the OFC classified's last week! Also saw some on kijiji
539158,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-14 03:01:00,2050,I'll have mine out on Sunday Dano - so if the kids get cold they can warm up in it.  I know if the fishing is slow Averie will likely watch a movie while she fishes! lol Talk about roughin' it!
539233,danbouck,2011-01-14 11:46:00,4380, lol Great idea
539240,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-14 12:50:00,2690,"  We'll have ours out as well, Dan...so a couple places to warm up for a bit, if need be. Keep your eyes open, though if you really want one...not sure if Joey sold theirs yet...same model that Ryan and I have.  Great hut for two or one."
539438,Big Cliff,2011-01-14 20:29:00,6899,"The family got me a 4 man SubZero for Christmas and I really love it. A little black cat heater in it and we were very comfortable. Now it is rated as a 4 man but two of us with our gear and the heater was just right, 4 would be crowded. CTC has them on special quuite often for about $100.00 off so they aren't a bad deal."
539780,Governator,2011-01-15 18:02:00,879,"Hey Guys,  I got the clam base camp, has anyone been successful setting it up by themself?  I've found it nearly impossible, I just can't keept he 4 corners down in order to pop up the top, is there a better way to try by yourself?  Pretty easy to setup with another person just thought I'd like the possibility of bringing it alone too."
539786,BFSC Kevin,2011-01-15 18:17:00,1351,"I have the eskimo quick fish 3 which is pretty much the same thing i think. I open it myself all the time. Just pop out the roof/top piece first then the sides of the hut. Sometimes it goes smoothly and it will pop right up, sometimes I need to pull it against the wind..."
539810,Governator,2011-01-15 19:54:00,879,"  Hey Kevin - That's what I keep trying to do, but it won't lay flat for me to do that.  When I try to pop the roof/top first the opposite side flips up at me.  I'm just I just need some practice and maybe need to work it in a bit.  Cheers"
539821,Governator,2011-01-15 20:27:00,879,"Wooooww... now the top roof hinge broke just trying to pop it up, so it's completely wrecked and won't pop up anymore.  Awesome I now have a freaking broken shack without it being on the ice.  Unreal I don't understand what I did wrong, I did the exact same thing they show on their video from their site.  I've never felt so completely useless before."
539875,BFSC Kevin,2011-01-16 00:53:00,1351,Yikes! I was wondering how durable the hut will be with this need of popping in and out all the time
539892,2jack2,2011-01-16 01:34:00,92," Oh no, sorry to hear that, anything I can help? need any replacement parts?"
540007,Jer,2011-01-16 13:44:00,1426,"With my Eskimo pop-up, I find it much easier to anchor down at least 3 corners before trying to pop the top or sides. It gives you something to pull against."
540025,Big Cliff,2011-01-16 14:52:00,6899," Now that makes sense, good tip because I found mine easy to do with two people but was thinking it might be hard to do on my own. Thanks for the tip!"
541612,Governator,2011-01-20 20:28:00,879,Thanks guys for the advice & offer for help.  I just wanted to give big props to Clam Corp. for providing some great customer service.  I explained what happened and they just asked for my mailing address and are sending me a replacement hub that I broke without any questions!  These guys are great and because of that I'll continue to buy from them.  They certainly made me happy.  Cheers
