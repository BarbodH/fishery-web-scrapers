541539,Billy Bob,2011-01-20 16:35:00,5865,"George is a good guy that runs a FIRST class operation unlike Dick at Gogama....At Air Ivanhoe there are a LOT of different lakes and packages to choose from....When the bride and I went a few years ago we had very good walleye fishing at Nemegosenda Lake but only 1 pike and no other species were caught. His overnight rooms for the night before you fly out are FANTASTIC...my wife wanted to just stay there....  Good Luck, Bob"
541568,solopaddler,2011-01-20 18:03:00,8605,"Croasdell Lake is amazing. IMO their best lake. No cabin though, it's a mini cabin (plywood floor and frame covered with canvas).  Only problem I believe they're resting it this year.  Wouldn't hurt to ask though."
541603,davew3,2011-01-20 20:07:00,430,"We went to number two river camp.  Not a bad place, very basic. Outside shower. Lot's of area to fish.   I hope it won't be as hot out for you as it was for us last summer. 100 degrees in the shade during the heat wave. I won big fish with an 8lb pike of the dock. Lot's of small pike, pics and pearch as well.  Main lodge is great.  Good luck."
541846,beerman,2011-01-21 12:57:00,118,Thanks. We were looking at Lemoine lake or Bonar Lake? We just want to try something different. I am not sure if the fishing is as good as Cochrane Air?
541855,solopaddler,2011-01-21 13:29:00,8605,"No shortage of walleyes on either lake, although smaller in size on average.  Both camps and lakes are very nice, way better than anything north of Cochrane."
541867,beerman,2011-01-21 14:02:00,118,"Thank You. Its tough to switch outfitters, we have been going to Cochrane Air for years! But we want a change. Are the lakes as secluded as cochrane? If you had a choice, what lake would you pick? Out of Air Ivanhoe? I plan on taking my 12 year old son.."
541875,solopaddler,2011-01-21 14:20:00,8605," Most of the lakes are just as secluded, some aren't because of private cabins and atv access.  The two lakes you mentioned are both good, can't really go wrong.  If I fish with these guys again it'll likely be Rice though. I've heard from others the walleye fishing is amazing and it's a huge lake which I like.  Is this a family trip with your son? Reason I ask I'm in the process of getting something booked for my family in July. My two kids are young, aged 4 and 7.  Normally I would fly with my friend Eddie to the Attawapiskat but he's booked solid.  I've searched high and low trying to find a good and cheap alternative.  Most outfitters offer 50% off for young kids, not bad, but when you have two it's still expensive.  Long story short I found a great outfitter (one I've flown with several timres), and after July 1st kids 12 and under are totally free with two paying adults.  Adult rate is $875 Canadian tax in for a week, $750 for 4 nights.  Really really good deal imo. If you're interested in which outfitter pm me."

541882,beerman,2011-01-21 14:39:00,118,"Thanks... Its not really a family trip, but yet it is. My uncles are going, and a friend. We fish hard. But we like to relax also. We LOVE walleye fishing. I have heard Rice lake is awesome. Wonder how bad the lake gets with the wind?"
541943,Billy Bob,2011-01-21 16:36:00,5865, I did Nemegosenda Lake Lodge with my bride using the American plan....TOO MUCH food was my only complaint...
