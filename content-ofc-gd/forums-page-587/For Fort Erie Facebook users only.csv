I've bought two boxes myself which I dedicated to my mentors and made and hung them all. I've only got 6 left (5 Residential and 1 Business)so if you live there or have a business in Fort Erie it's a good cause and it's completely not for profit.  There's also a map so bird watchers can capture photos of the little ducks with the sponsors name on it. If you want to make one from our plans and donate it the let me know ASAP so I don't make too many. http://maps.google.ca/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=204346059742573269152.0004838040b9916466b48&t=h&z=13  Thank you kindly Dan Andrews
