541894,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-21 15:05:00,0,definitely not out of place grimace! i swear the other day in heyden (just north of soo 10 minutes) i saw a guy dressed in a burlap sack!
541898,Grimace,2011-01-21 15:08:00,2020,   That made me laugh out loud.  Cheers
541939,Billy Bob,2011-01-21 16:24:00,5865, But do you agree it's better then this crappy fashion ? 
541942,mercman,2011-01-21 16:30:00,7054,"S'UP DAWG ?  i dont believe they will actually stop him from wearing camo as a fashion, but if you look like a duck, and qvack like a duck, what do you think you are ???. Its just a way that authorities can control his 'hunting' urges, and keep the city safe."
541945,walleyejigger,2011-01-21 16:46:00,876,"although what he did was highly illegal, and deserves what he got, i bet he got some praise from neighbors and locals for taking matters into his own hands, like said this had nothing to do with hunting"
541949,mercman,2011-01-21 16:58:00,7054,"Hunting or not, the guy is a yahoo.But, i kinda sympathize with him a wee bit.Back in the old days, i was having skunk problems.I lived in a suburb not far from here. One nite it came around and stunk up the neighborhood again. I was tanked up pretty good and grabbed my 12 gauge, snuck around the corner, and blew its brains out.Every lite in the neigborhood lit up, i ran back in, and nobody called the cops, but people always looked at me a bit funny afterwards I dont do things like that anymore.  "
541538,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-20 16:35:00,0,Nice to see somebody getting a substantial punishment for once! 
541543,Billy Bob,2011-01-20 16:44:00,5865,"""Gervais also received a lifetime ban on engaging or associating in any hunting-related activities, or possessing hunting-related sporting equipment in an area where game wildlife within Ontario"".  That part seems a bit harsh, don't you think.....is he allowed a hunting hat or boots...how about a 4 wheeler or a hunting knife...what about binoculars....the list could go on and on..."
541544,Grimace,2011-01-20 16:52:00,2020,Bob I am sure they will keep it within reason.  Probably lots of fine print we do not see that allows him to own stuff like that.  This dude sounds like a train wreck.  Glad to see they threw the book at him.   Maybe that could deter a few cowboys.
541545,misfish,2011-01-20 16:56:00,29133,"Think I may just print that off, and post it on my no tresspassing signs."
541546,bigugli,2011-01-20 17:00:00,6138,Sounds like a suitable punishment.
541547,splashhopper,2011-01-20 17:00:00,2931,
541550,troutologist,2011-01-20 17:09:00,951,"Yup throw the book at resource offenders.  Obviously some people make mistakes, but these gross offenses deserve tougher penalties than have been doled out."
541553,Billy Bob,2011-01-20 17:29:00,5865," Ya, you're probably right...."
541556,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-20 17:32:00,0,"to be honest, if this guy shot a gun in a city at an animal more than once (with a school in the area no less), IMO i don't think he even deserves to own a hunting hat or binoculars.  he's obviously not responsible enough for even those items."
541560,cuzza,2011-01-20 17:40:00,467, If they don't read the no trespassing signs - do you think they'll take the time to read all that?  Not making light of any trespasser issues you may be having.
541563,OhioFisherman,2011-01-20 17:48:00,6623,They should have also plastered a not allowed to hunt tat on his forehead!
541566,jediangler,2011-01-20 17:58:00,1923,I heard that he'll not be hosting the Golden Globes next year either.
541573,timmeh,2011-01-20 18:16:00,609,"Wonder if there are any criminal code charges along with this? I'm no legal expert, and don't have all the facts, but I think he's kinda of lucky they charged him with carless use of a firearm for hunting under the FWCA and not careless use of a firearm under the criminal code. Or both."
541586,cityfisher,2011-01-20 19:11:00,959,idiot ... deserves it all !
541598,shane,2011-01-20 19:57:00,652,"""that he be prohibited from possessing, applying for, and/or obtaining any Ontario hunting license for the rest of his life."" Doesn't seem like much of a punishment for this guy.  He was already hunting without a license."
541600,Twocoda,2011-01-20 20:03:00,4130, exactly so the NEXT time he gets caught ...they will give him two lifetime bans....
541608,troutologist,2011-01-20 20:23:00,951,I would think the sentence following the one you quoted is the part of the ruling that gives a lot of authority to keep tabs on his activities as well as issue any secondary charges. I would have to suspect there is a chargable infraction if he is caught hunting with or without a lisence. Hopefully this give the MNR the clout to serve more severe penalties.
541642,TJQ,2011-01-20 21:02:00,7806,That dude does not like bears....
541652,aplumma,2011-01-20 21:38:00,6896,  Wheres T.J. he was just here a minute ago???  Something must have scared him....  art
541656,mercman,2011-01-20 21:47:00,7054," I think they mainly want to control this guys bad habits and lack of responsibility.If you own a hunting knive and hunting clothes, you are probably hunting.They left the terms vague on purpose i bet."
541694,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-20 23:15:00,10439,The only thing they missed was confiscating his guns and pulling his PAL for life.
541831,Billy Bob,2011-01-21 11:51:00,5865, Hey C.C. I see a LOT of guys wearing their hunting clothes ice fishing...
541849,porkpie,2011-01-21 13:09:00,2521,"I suspect this had very little to do with hunting, and more just a dude that is pissed off at nuisance bears, and had his screen door ripped of more than once.  He is probably an angry man who feels that the government is doing nothing to stem the problem, and said screw it, I'll just start gunning them down in the street when I see them.  I suspect, although don't know, that he is a bit of a local hero for doing it!  The trespass charge likely stems from the dump shooting.  I could almost guess it was an eartag bear that had been relocated, and was known for being a problem animal.  This is what I get from reading between the lines.  There is nothing about hunting in this story if you ask me, other than the charges that where issued."
541880,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-21 14:33:00,0,"  dude, you live in NYS. i've seen the pulaski area!  all the hill people wear that crap year round down there!"
541887,Grimace,2011-01-21 14:50:00,2020,I have not noticed anything about NYS in general but these pictures would not be too out of place in the Soo either.
