541141,Old Man,2011-01-19 01:51:00,822,"Probably more than you want to know.     Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Insecta Order: Hemiptera Suborder: Heteroptera Family: Rhopalidae Subfamily: Serinethinae Genus: Boisea Species: B. trivittata  Boisea trivittata is an American species of true bug, commonly known as the Box Elder Bug, the Zug, or Maple Bug. It is found primarily on boxelder trees, as well as maple and ash trees [1] . The adults are about 12½ mm (½ in) long with a dark brown or black coloration, relieved by red wing veins and markings on the abdomen. Nymphs are bright red. The boxelder bug is sometimes known as a garage beetle or may be confused with other Jadera spp., especially Boisea rubrolineata. The name ""stink bug,"" which is more regularly applied to the family Pentatomidae, is sometimes used to refer to Boisea trivittata. Instead, these insects belong to the family Rhopalidae, the so-called ""scentless plant bugs"". However, boxelder bugs are redolent and will release a pungent and bad-tasting compound upon being disturbed to discourage predation; this allows them to form conspicuous aggregations without being preyed on."
