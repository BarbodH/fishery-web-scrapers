540831,lew,2011-01-18 13:01:00,12766," My son was an iron worker for 20 years and back in the  90's the Canadian company he worked for was putting up 2 hi-rise buildings in China, one in Shanghai and another in Bejing. Jim was sent over there for 2 years to supervise the construction of the steel.  His crews were mostly Chinese and Jim became very close friends with many of them and they'd often all head out to restaurants after work where they'd introduce him to many of the local delecacies. He really enjoyed alot of the dishes not available here but said many were just too brutal to even try.  He said the worst experience was when they decided to have snake for dinner one night and placed the order. The waiter left, then came back to the table with a live 5' snake for their approval. When they decided that was the one they wanted, the waiter stood on the snakes tail and with one hand grabbed it by the head and stretched it out to it's full length, then with the other hand used a razor knife to gut and skin the snake right at the table while it was still alive. It was then taken away and cooked.  Jim was very tough guy but said that was just too much for him and he was unable to even try it.  He lasted longer than me though, I woulda left when the waiter 1st brought it out"

540916,ADB,2011-01-18 16:21:00,444,"It all depends on where you go.  Generally, the better the restaurant, the better the customer service.  One time at Baton Rouge with my family for my birthday...  I ordered a steak, medium.  The cut of the steak was a little bit uneven and by the time I got to the other end it was completely raw.  Unacceptable at a steakhouse.  We told the waiter, who took it upon himself to tell the manager.  My steak was comped and I was offered a new one, even though I had eaten more than half.  I was also offered free dessert and given a $25 gift certificate.  Now that's service."
541129,Cookslav,2011-01-19 01:32:00,1457," Easy cowboy LOL... I think you have to bare in mind what you are ordering and where. There's and old saying in proffessional kitchens when customers get pushy on times. ""you can have it now....or when its cooked""  If your ordering a Burger, fish N chips, or basic Pub grub 20minutes is fair. But if you're in a more upscale restaurant some items can and will take more then 20 minutes to prepare. But I suppose thats the difference between an upscale restaurant, and a road house....  High end eatery...your paying for quality, and the overall dinning experience Road house....your looking for big portions, fast, and cheap. I try to keep an open mind and remember that when I'm out, as I can be fairly discerning when it comes to my food. Heck the Wife usually makes me promise to not judge while I'm out....apparently it gets annoying LOL!  Just remember to be polite and honest....I have seen my fair share of hot heads. If your being respectfull, and reasonable its all good. Just remember those waiters/waitresses are people who are there to provide a service They are not ""servents"", Slaves, or any less of a person then you as the guest. I have dealt with my fair share of guest service issues, and I can say with certainty A Respectful complaint will get you further then ranting or yelling at your waiter will. On occasion I have been known to throw the more obnoxious complainer, and if nessasary their entire table out....  Dinning is about atmosphere, as much as it is food...Yelling & Screaming like a lunatic, or being mean to the point that your server is forced to tears disrupts the room for the rest of my customers. Respect is a two way street And the way I see it.... I will make ANY complaint right, pay the tab, and discount your next visit...but if the respect isn't there. You are simply taking up space in my restaurant that could be otherwise occupied by another customer that would be happy Just to be here...don't let the door hit ya  But thats just me"

Another time they opened the lid of a pot that was still sizzling and out jumped live shrimp. Everyone at the table was grabbing the shrimp with their chop sticks and eating them live.

I ordered fish & chips (their specialty) and after one bite into the fish I called the waitress over to tell her that the fish was horribly overcooked. She took it back to the kitchen and returned shortly thereafter to say there was nothing wrong with it but I could order something else, oh and I would be charged for both. I then said to forget everything and that I would not pay. She then brought the owner out who said that she would make an exception but that next time I would have to pay. I politely told her that there would never be a 'next time'. I left and did not pay!"

Say no, but want change back from twenty. After profuse fake apology, I get my change, close to $12 back.  So...while eating get seated where I can see the counter...guy pulls the same thing on all the next customers for the next half hour and manages to misdirect 3 groups to forget to get change.

Low and behold, my sister-in-law finds a hair on her plate while enjoying her entree. The waitress was summoned and immediately apologized profusely. Without hesitation, a replacement entree was offered(which my sister-in-law declined, she was enjoying the meal despite the hair), her portion was wiped from the bill and she was also offered a no charge specialty coffee along with dessert. Everything was offered right on the spot with no management consultation, the staff had the leeway to make sure everyone was happy.  We enjoyed the rest of our meal and left a healthy tip."

Dropping the fries was not the big thing but reaching down & putting them back on the plate was. As for her getting fired, we have no way of knowing if this was an over reaction to the situation (discipline of some sort was required) or just the straw that broke the camels back in regard to her previous history.

539731,JohnF,2011-01-15 16:01:00,3494,"I think I am seldom disappointed by the food and service I get at franchise places because I have very low expectations going in and generally go with the least destructible menu items like burgers and toasted westerns. For fine dining I'll go elsewhere other than a few local franchise spots I'm familiar with but even then I tend to go to independently operated places. One of the best breakfasts we've had in the last few years was in a tiny little hole-in-the-wall (the town and the restaurant)clinging to the side of a mountain in Arizona near Sedona. It was just a lucky choice for us but it reminded me that independent restaurants are most often the way to go when you are willing to sacrifice glitter and chrome for decent food. Yeah, there's still a risk, but what the hey?  In defence of the staff and food at many shiny franchise type restaurants there is not enough attention given to training and food preparation. The staff turns over often, are not well trained as a rule, and are pushing to get as many turns at their stations as possible during a shift. The food is delivered to the restaurant frozen which is why it tends to be consistent from Florida to Sudbury although it's interesting to see the regional influences in some franchises. (Biscuits and gravy at McDonalds down south?)  BTW. I spent a year of my life managing a pub style restaurant in our theatre town and if I learned nothing else, I now know that the restaurant business is a bugger to succeed in and that's a hard and expensive lesson to learn. We probably did better than we deserved based on our training and experience but we made up for it with hard work and business common sense. I have tons of respect for folks who succeed in the restaurant business from servers to chefs/cooks and managers. It ain't easy. But that does not excuse bad food and lousy service - ever.  JF"

The kids go to Canadian Adventure Camp and we love the area, and loved going to the Chinese restaurant in town."
539760,Big Cliff,2011-01-15 17:08:00,6899,"In my business I deal with all kinds of food establishments often from before they even open the doors for the first time. Some, you just know aren't going to make it, they don't have a clue. It is a shame because many of them have their dreams shattered mostly because of poor management. Some open their doors without even doing any market research, some with no financial backing. People that start a cafe and their only experience is that they once worked as a waitress.  It is a tough industry but if you serve a good quality product, have excellent service and fair prices you have a fighting chance.  A good example is a place here in Lindsay, St. Dave's Dinner. Dave opened in a little out of the way hard to find place but he insisted that everything he served would be quality. It didn't take long and it was standing room only, you had to line up just to get in for lunch. Even his coffee had to be the best, his logic, save a penny loose a customer you do the math.  Dave just opened a new place on Hwy. 36 here in town, it is much bigger than the last one but still packed to the doors from morning to night. This is in the same place that the former owners couldn't make a go of it because of a lack of business. The difference; quality, portions, service, and fair prices. Oh, and he is within sight of a Tim Hortons.  By comparison what had been a busy coffee shop here in town got bought up by some people from out of town. The husband who in my opinion wouldn't know a good cup of coffee from used motor oil decided that he could save about $0.02 a cup by going to a lower quality coffee and it was good coffee!!!! (in his opinion) It only took about a month but now if you go in there you might find two or three people when it's busy. Their entire focus has turned to buying the cheepest they can of everything regardless of quality. It is sad, his wife is a wonderful person but hubby said!  If you want the best quality food and service at the best prices, go where the locals go. If you are going somewhere new, google it and read the reviews if there are any."
539900,wallyboss,2011-01-16 01:52:00,1095,"Just read the one about Pizza Hut, let me tell you that I have a good one from a Pizza Hut in Ottawa. By the way this isn't a waitress or manager or cook story, it's a customer young teenager she was probably 15 or 16.  Me and wife walk in and get a table, there was not too many people in the restaurant but there was one table with 4 adults and 4 teenagers. I am looking at the menu and all of a sudden I hear some laughing coming from the All You Can Eat Buffet Table, I turn my head just in time to see this girl pick up a plate, she licks it and puts it back down on top the stacks of plates for the next customers. I got up and went up to her and asked her with a loud voice what the hell she was doing licking a plate and putting back on top of the other ones. Every body else in the restaurant heard me, but for some reason her parents never said a word about it. So I went to see the manager and politely told her what happened. The manager went up to there table and tossed the whole bunch out.  They closed to the All You Can Eat for the night and was offered my dinner( Pizza ) for free.  They hadn't even started eating so I am glad for the other customers that they didn't pick up that plate. The worse thing was that on there way out the parents and the teenagers were laughing about it."
539956,Rattletrap2,2011-01-16 05:00:00,1652,"I have a couple of additions to this post!  At Christmas, it has been a tradition for us to order Chinese food on Christmas eve and the whole family joins us. I always order enough for left overs on Christmas day as well. We have our Turkey Dinner on Boxing Day for various reasons.  The last 4 years, we have had to pick our order up because delivery is unavailable for this area. This year, i ordered $143.00 worth of food and was told it would be 2 hours. Not a big problem, but I was a little taken aback by this. We headed into town right on time an found the whole place packed with people. There must have been 15 to 20 people in this tiny little take-out joint waiting for their orders! Some told us they ordered 4 hours earlier that day and some said they ordered the day before.  It was Christmas eve and everyone was in a pretty good mood but it was frustrating. I waited for another full hour for our order. What was I to do? I couldn't go home empty handed with 11 people waiting on me!  I thought the Management should have come out from the back kitchen and said something. Instead, they left the part time staff (kids) to deal with people who were starting to get angry. I think they could also have offered us a can of pop or something while we waited for the inconvenience? They just kept taking orders.  Anyways, we got home and found they had shorted us one item off our order, but still charged us for it.. The food was excellent tasting as always and I never complained. I thought about it, but with the holidays and all, I just never bothered.  I'm pretty sure they are the only Chinese Food place left in town!   On another note, my Youngest Daughter worked for a short time at a new Wild Wing's franchise in Brampton. The staff was expected to have their own float of change on them when they showed up (minimum $20.00) and had to purchase all orders themselves before they served a customer the food. If you didn't pay, they got stuck paying for it. Very strange way of doing business in my opinion!! Thankfully, She found something better and quit.  Anyone else hear of this sort of practice?  I have had other bad experiences in restaurants. Some i did not tip in if it was the servers fault. If it was the restaurants fault, I usually complain to the manager and usually it is settled.  The two Pizza Hut stories are a real laugh.....now, but not at the time I guess?"

539989,fish_fishburn,2011-01-16 12:33:00,1311,"I had a incident last week with my lunch.  I had forgot my lunch on the kitchen table when I headed out to work in the morning. On my way to the office for duty at noon I stopped at the local Subway down the street and grabbed a sub. I got to the office and settled in and ate half my sub. The first bite of the other half and a nice long black hair comes sliding out of my sub. Spit the bite into the garbage and throw the remainder of my sub in as well. Pissed me off, cause I was really hungry and enjoyed the first half. Then I got thinking, I don't recall any of the staff wearing hair nets or the little hats that most of the Subway servers wear. I will let them know the next time I stop in, what happened, and will be looking to see if they are wearing their hair nets. I very seldom eat out anymore because most of the time the food is disapointing, and being one that likes to cook maybe my expectations are to high.  Also I went into a Kelseys in our area once. It was about 8:00 pm on a saturday evening and there were very few customers in the restaurant. My girl and I order and our food comes in about 15 minutes then this airhead server drags down a big vacuum cleaner and starts vacuumung the floor all around us. We couldn't even talk because of the noise. So I sop the girl and politely ask if she can do that after were done. She told me were closing in an hour and she was told by the manager to start vacuuming. Fine with me, that was 3 yrs ago and I haven't gone back to this day.  Was never a big fan of there boil in a bag over priced food anyway. Most of the chain franchises main concern is turning tables as quick as possible, they really don't care about your dining experience."

I finished the job and was collecting the money for the work when she asked if I would like a glass of tea. I said sure thanks and she poured me a glass of it with ice and handed it to me. I downed the tea which was very sweet but it was liquid and handed the glass back and thanked her as I headed out the door. I drove about a block and then my head started to spin and my body felt like I was floating so I pulled over and for the next 45 minutes I felt like I had heat stroke. I was feeling better and since I have never had heat related symptoms so I called the nice Asian lady who had offered me the tea to find out what kind it was.....Well all that I can say is when someone offers you tea ASK if it is made from tea or something else it seems a refreshing drink in her house is made from Poppy seeds.

540174,spincast,2011-01-16 21:48:00,3279,"Wow - I have had so many its hard to decide - so perhaps I will share my all time fave: we were in China to adopt our first, and in the provincial captial. Our group leader was a very nice and personable guy, who for some unkown reason felt that he had to constantly out do or show me up. For the most part I am just quiet and reserved (with the exception of the occaission quip), and I just took his attention in stride and laughed along with him when ever he felt a scored a point.  Anyway - we were in Hunan, one of the ""spicy provinces"" Meals in the hotels were brutally expensive, so as a group we would all go out to a local restauarant referred to us by the guide. In China they serve everything on big lazy susans that take up the whole table except for where you eat, and the dishes just keep coming. They consider it rude, as in they have not fed you enough, if when you leave the table there is no food left - so the food comes in never ending amounts.  In this particular restaurant, we had been to it several times, and the food was pretty good. On one visit one of the girls came back a little shaken because she had seen a 4 ft snake on the stairs - apparently one of the fresh dinners had escaped and needed to be put back in his pen ....  Anyway, Mike, the leader, asks if anyone likes spicy food, to which I pipe up, you bet ( a lot of the people on our tour were somewhat reserved in their choices, and Chinese food can be exotic, the snake just touches the edge of what you can get - Ihave pics of a farmers market you would not believe - including smoked bat), but i digress - excusey.  So the waitress comes to the table and the usual is ordered by the guide, along with one spicy chicken dish Mike and I are going to share. They also provide red chilli pepper sauce in oil to dip in. So there were Mike and I enjoing our spicy food, sittingon opposite sides of the table, flipping the lazy susn back and forth to each other as we shared the hot dish. Mike was obviously finding it somewhat uncomfortable - he was starting to sweat and his face was turning red; BUT there was NO WAY he was going to let anyone at the table know - especially as I was enjoying it. He and I were exchanging barbs and having a good laugh, and downing copius quantities of ridiculously cheap beer ($0.18 a litre). Now let me say at this point, there are no knives and forks in the provinces, you learn to eat with a pair of chopsticks or a very small soup spoon - which doesn't work too well. Suddenly as I'm looking at Mike, he makes a strange expression - he had been chewing and stops, he looks at me with questions in his eyes, opens his mouth, puts the chopsticks in, and pulls out the whole head of the chicken, wattle, eyes beak tongue  and all. It is amazing how quickly a man's face can go from red to green"

Helen and Terry pick some dumb times to go on holidays... but they took their son to China this summer so he would't miss school if they did it another time of year. The other year.. they couldn't get a single person to work for them to wash dishes. I told them to do take out only.. but they closed instead.
539531,Beans,2011-01-14 23:58:00,3339," Don't know if this is the same place Cliff...   Just before we moved up this way, my old Chrysler station wagon blew a head gasket in Omemee...Maribeth got a ride back to Richmond Hill (dog needed food etc) and I stayed at my bro and sis-in-law's place in Lindsay for three days...I offered to buy a Chinese take-out for supper one night for their family and I went to the buffet place on Hwy 35 just below Hwy 7...Everything looked very good on the buffet and our take-out was great...  Fast forward a couple of years and for our anniversary that year we went to the same place for their buffet...BIG mistake...everything with any meat (wings,ribs) were hard and dried out...even the chicken balls and shrimp spring rolls...veggie dishes were soggy and mushy...Dessert was good...(had to say sumpin' nice) I doubt we will ever go back there again but if you do...order off the menu...  If I couldn't cook Chinese better than that (and I can...ask Meely and CPH)(my first father-in-law was a graduate Chef of Hong Kong University) I would close up shop...  Too bad this happened as we don't get to eat out very often...usually just anniversaries and birthdays ...   "
539533,HTHM,2011-01-15 00:02:00,4082,"One thing to bear in mind that if one refuses to pay for a meal, quite often the server is stuck with the bill. IE: Dine and dash. As well, if you send it back to the kitchen, it most likely will get messed with. The worst experience I had was a business dinner where we had exceptional service and exceptional food, (we were a party of 9 with a bill of $1200.00) and a boor at our table who slipped the server a c-note and his hotel room key as we were leaving. He boasted about it on the way back to the hotel, and it was all I could do to not deck him."

We were the ONLY customers in the place. We order our diet pop's and a pizza. Waitress comes back with the pop's. All the employee's are standing at the bar having their stuff chat. An HOUR later the waitress brings us our bill. I politely asked her if it was normal to bring a customer the bill before they get their dinner? Her reply was, you already had your dinner. I politely said that if we did have our dinner wouldn't we still have the pizza tray and the plates still on the table? She then said , i don't know what kind of bull crap your trying to pull but your not leaving till you pay the bill. I said , then you better get the manager over here now. She went to the bar, talked to the manager, he stomped over and said why are you trying to get out of paying for your dinner. I said , if she had actually brought our dinner i would pay for it but since she didn't I'm not paying for something i didn't get. Well you got your drinks so you have to pay for them or i will call the cops. At that point i had, had enough and said , then you better get on the phone while you still can . We have not been back and never will."

She Picked up food that was spilt on the table and put it back on their plate????....nevermind the ashes That is simply discusting, unsanitary and unacceptable. You drop a guests food you replace the food and appologise profusely. The ONLY time you tell a guest they are wrong, is when you don't want their business...and the only time you don't want someones business is because they are either disrupting the atmosphere for the other guests, or they are litterlly and legally speaking....harrassing your staff.  Billy, I'd write a letter, e-mail or even give the Manager/ownership a call. Any reputable establishment will make it right, and treat you to a decent meal that will make you WANT to return and pay. Sometimes restaurants make mistakes...and sometimes its as simple as someone calling in sick that sets a series of unfortunate events into action. Its how we learn from the poor experiences, and what we do to recover our guests that sets us appart from the hacks out there.  At the end of the day.... In Hospitality our job is to exceed the guests expectations, and if we fail...try and try again.  One thing I do recommend for a group of 16 is to definatly make a reservation. Most restaurants are in the business of Nickles and dimes....if they don't expect a busy night they will send staff home early or short schedule to save on labor. Giveing even an hours notice can allow them to prepare, or even call in some help."
539612,John Bacon,2011-01-15 02:39:00,3277,I have never refused to pay for the meal but I did leave without tipping once.  I tried in vain to flag the waitress down to get some water for my wife before a customer from another table took pity and gave us their water piture.  On a more positive note; I ordered a medium steak from Kellseys at 401 & Morningside and received a well done steak.  The waitress both replaced and credited the meal and gave me a complimentary dessert as well.  I was actually glad that they had messed up my order in the end.

539377,Billy Bob,2011-01-14 18:10:00,5865,"Here is just a EXAMPLE (BELOW) of a bad restaurant experience I have read somewhere else.....we have probably all experience a bad dinner while dinning out...maybe not this bad or maybe even a little worse...  I have never said ""I am not paying for this dinner"" but a couple times on the way home I wish I had.....has anyone NOT paid for their dinner and if so how did you handle it.    We were invited to Restaurant X for dinner with 8 other couples. We were very excited to go because of our previous experience with the restaurant. My husband and I had been there before and had very good food and service. Unfortunately, food and service change when management changes. We sat down for our reservations at approximately 7:50 and ordered shortly afterwards. Appetizers and salads came out slowly. However, our dinners did not even begin to be served until around 9:50. One of our guests had to leave because of family obligations and took his dinner home in a to-go container. Dinners slowly trickled in at about 9:50 one at a time. We could not all eat together because not everyone had a dinner. Six guests had order fillets but did not get them prepared as ordered. They were very tough and not cooked to their request. Two of our guests never got their dinners! It was only after about 15 minutes after the last dinner was brought out (approximately 10:30) that the server came back to ask about the dinners. This is when they were told that the final 2 dinners were never served. Unfortunately, the owner/management never came out to make amends. He stayed in the back and let his servers deal with the unsatisfied customers. He never came out to apologize or offer any complimentary drinks, appetizers to hold over the guests who did not get their dinner, or any money off the bill. Two dinners and one dinner that was sent back, were taken off the bill only after one of our guests requested it. Obviously, the kitchen and staff were not prepared. Several times during the evening the servers stated that they were going through a transition. Transitions happen but bad customer service is unacceptable. As much as I enjoyed my visit to Restaurant X for our couple dinner, I would never go back because of the change in owners or management which made this experience very disappointing."
539379,Governator,2011-01-14 18:14:00,879,"Sounds like Hell's Kitchen.  I've had terrible service three times from a certain franchise of breakfast joints (Which after our last experience we don't go to anymore).

Then I would have issued my complaint and then I would never go back to that restaurant.  You are paying for a service. If I did not get the service so I don't feel obligated to pay for something I did not want or expect.  On the other hand if there was a real effort to quickly remedy the situation by the management I have no difficulty paying for this appropriately. I tip based on the quality of both the service and prepartion of the food. The atmosphere is much more than the ambionce of the restaurant and this includes how well I was treated too. I never blame the waiter/waitress for management arragance.  In the case above, I would be very upset with the service and I would not pay for it.  Just my 3 cents (inflation) .... muddler"
539388,wallyboss,2011-01-14 18:34:00,1095,"My worst experience happened a few years back when it was still legal to smoke inside.  I stopped in to this restaurant to warm as my work that day was outside.  So I order my fries and a burger combo. Sit down and I lite up a cigarette.  There was 2 of us smoking and it took about 20 minutes to get our food. 20 minutes, 2 smokers there was lots of stray ashes around the ashtray. My buddy gets his order and I get my burger, I asked the waitress about my fries and she says that she was busy and forgot, so she goes back to the kitchen and 5 minutes later comes back to the table with my order of fries and puts it in front of me but 4-5 fries fall off the plate and into the stray ashes, she reaches over grabs the fries and puts them back in my plate.  I completely lost it on that stupid waitress. I didn't pay for my food and walked out, so the manager comes out to try to gte me to pay and I told him the story he politely told me not too worry about the bill and walked back in. Within 25 minutes the waitress comes out to ask me what I had told the manager because she just got fired. My response was  "" You got to be kidding me, having the nerves to ask"""

I have had this in Gimli Manitoba and it was really great, so we figured it is a chain type product, must be good in Dryden,  Boy was I wrong.  The chicken must have been sitting under heat lamps for a day, it was tough, dried out and very small pieces. I had one piece that looked to be a fair size and when I broke it in half to pick it apart with my fingers, it was 2 potatoes stuck together that had been battered and stuck in with the chicken.  So guys and gals if you go through Dryden and you see the chicken sign at the Husky station , don't stop, the colonel is just a few blocks away."

539404,Pikeslayer,2011-01-14 19:24:00,1443,"I think the simple and most effective way to handle a negative restaurant experience is: 1.Relax and stay calm- being overbearing, rude, agressive or demanding will only make matters worse and most likely embarrassing for everyone involved (including other diners). 2.Ask to speak with the manager away from your table (at the bar or hostess station). 3.Remain calm, speak in an even tone. 4.Tell the manager exactly what was wrong with your dining experience and do not exagerate. 5.Ask the manager, what she/he is willing to do to make it right and to convince you to come back to his/her establishment.  Depending on the offer and whether or not you are satisfied would determine whether you choose to return to the establishment or tell every living soul about your negative experience. The good establishments make it right. The bad ones close their doors."
539430,Fish4Eyes,2011-01-14 19:49:00,1022,"I worked in the industry for 8 years before starting my career. Some of the above is valid reasoning, but alot of it is not.  BillyBob: a manager will not come out and speak to you, if you did not request one, or if the server did not tell his/her manager about the issue. Servers will avoid telling managers about issues because they dont want to get in crap. They usually just take the loss and expect to not get no tip. Next time request a manager and watch the bill get lowered or free items brought to your table.  Key word of advice to people in a restaurant: snarkyness will not get you nothing but bad service because as soon as you do that they already know you are not the ""tipping"" type. Being polite and professional will get you the best service. Before complaining about how long you have waited for your food (I agree BillyBob 2 hours is ridiculous), take a look around you and observe how busy the restaurant is, and how busy the server is. If you want quality service, don't eat out on the weekends, and if you do, make sure it is after 8pm.  I bet money pikeslayer agrees with all of the above"

When I got home with my order, the food was lousy, no, it was REALLY bad. I went back the next day (1/2 an hour drive each way)with the food and asked to see the manager, he wasn't in so I asked that he call me.  He did call the next day and I explained that we had got food there many times before and it was always excellent but this was just not up to the standards we had come to expect from them.  He apologized and told me he had all new staff from Toronto and was having problems with them and if I would come back he would give me replacement food. I told him that I would love to come back but that I would appreciate it if he would call me when he had his staff straightened out because I really didn't want more of the same. He promissed he would. That was two years ago and I still haven't heard from him nor have I gone back again.  Unfortunatly if you want good chinese food in Lindsay I would suggest you go to Fenelon Falls! Now there is quality!"
