541758,Bernie,2011-01-21 02:01:00,3190,"Something like this happened at my house 20 some years ago. Only it was a guy and he only made it to the top of the stairs before he found himself quickly at the bottom after a good heave ho. I felt sorry for him after I found out he lived in the house one block away. He was pretty badly bruised but nothing broken.  And yes, he was at his sisters wedding dance at the local Legion hall."
