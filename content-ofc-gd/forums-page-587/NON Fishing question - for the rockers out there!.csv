541397,torco,2011-01-19 21:17:00,656,Definitely not Korn but they do seem like they could me an emo band or goth metal.
541403,smally21,2011-01-19 21:37:00,993,mike flicker produced most of hearts earlier stuff. the dude in the pic is longtime guitarist and producer howard leese.
541405,Pikeslayer,2011-01-19 21:49:00,1443, Yah.
541408,danbouck,2011-01-19 21:55:00,4380,I once had my hair like the guy on the left in the first pic but it kept getting tangled in my reel.
541439,rfmcrx,2011-01-20 00:06:00,42,The first band kinda looks like mudvayne.
541467,Dutchy,2011-01-20 02:26:00,416," Same, this is going to really annoy me...."
541477,kingofthesteelhead,2011-01-20 03:19:00,140,"Did your wife get a picture of Tommy Thayer.He was pushing his line of amplifiers. In case you didn,t recognize his name he is the guitarist of my favorite band which is?"
541507,BITEME,2011-01-20 13:38:00,1968,WHERE'S ALL THE MARSHALL'S
541516,Headhunter,2011-01-20 14:24:00,5703,"Out getting re-tubed!!! LOL Peter, there was just too much to see/do and not enough time. Plus, I wasn't there it was my wife who was lucky enough to be there... just know that if I was there, you'd have you Marshall pics! HH"
541530,Fishnwire,2011-01-20 15:51:00,983,"  The funny thing is if someone made those kind of comments to one of those guys and then asked them, ""Why would you want to go around looking like that?"", they'd happily answer, ""To get that kind of reaction out of people like you.""  Mission accomplished I guess."
541532,smally21,2011-01-20 15:51:00,993,"tommy thayer was ace freleys replacement for glamband KISS, who are, of course, awesome.  tommy went from cover band COLDGIN to the real thing and now dresses up as ace freley dressed up as a spaceman. got any hard ones?"
541536,Headhunter,2011-01-20 16:08:00,5703,"Each day of the NAMM show, they produced a mag that outlined the days events as well as product releases. This mag, which my brought back two copies of for me is the size of a Billboard magazine. In the Thursday edition, they have a full page ad of Tommy, in full Ace garb. I think, if memory serves me well, it was an ad for some kind of amp. HH"
541541,Roy,2011-01-20 16:41:00,13728,Duotone.
541611,highdrifter,2011-01-20 20:26:00,2534, Yep.  It's kinda hard to recognize them without their alien suits on though.  
541648,Dutchy,2011-01-20 21:26:00,416," Close, but no cigar IMO. The guys in the first pic I think were in a band called American Head Charge. The haircuts are different, but they did break up in 2009. Maybe they got real jobs!  They are sort of collaborating with mudvayne, so there could be someone from them in the pic, but most of them are not from mudvayne."
541317,Headhunter,2011-01-19 17:48:00,5703,"My wife was on a conference in L.A. last week and part of what she had to do, was attend the NAMM show in Anaheim. (North America Musical Instrument Manufacturers) trade show. She was clicking maddly at anything and everyone she thought ""looked important"" LOL So far, we have been able to identify everyone she has taken a pic of, except this group. They had mega median surrounding them, so, of course, my wife thought them to be stars or soon to be stars! She managed to squeeze in through the media horde and snap ths pic below. The guy on the left in the pic, gave her an ""atta girl"" for her tenacity. Now I probably wouldn't want to run into these guys in a dark alley, but my wife said they were really nice guys and very down to earth... So, can anyone here identify who these guys are?  Also, can anyone identify this dude! LOL  This guy is apparently the producer of Canada's own ""Heart"". He's also their lead guitar player  Sorry for the non fishing post, but it is winter and I thought this may be a decent diversion from the day to day grind."
541319,mercman,2011-01-19 17:50:00,7054,SECOND PIC KINDA LOOKS LIKE SKEETER
541321,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-19 17:52:00,2690,"Not sure who the top group is.  Michael Anthony, bass player for Van Halen...ROCK ON!!!!!"
541322,Spiel,2011-01-19 17:54:00,9065,"  Identify them....no.  But in a dark alley I'd think they'd be the scared ones, look like a bunch of sissies."
541324,Raf,2011-01-19 17:55:00,3495,what spiel said
541325,Headhunter,2011-01-19 17:55:00,5703,"Can't be Skeeter, there is no chilli in the pic, dude has too much hair and no banana bread to be found! LOL HH"
541327,irishfield,2011-01-19 17:56:00,26272,I was thinkin they look like 5 guys that need to get a real job.. get a real job..
541328,Raf,2011-01-19 17:57:00,3495,money is for nothing and the chicks for free irish
541329,BUSTER,2011-01-19 17:58:00,1336,"I always watch the NAMM videos on you tube, your wife is Lucky to get in there."
541330,Headhunter,2011-01-19 17:59:00,5703,"You may be right Chris, but it would be hard for me to tell as I was running as fast as my legs could carry my rotundness! I don't have eyes in the back of my head! I figure the guy on the left must have a much higher tolerance to pain then I do, I get sore just lookin at him! HH  Wayne, I want my MTV!"
541332,Spiel,2011-01-19 18:01:00,9065,"  LOL, run backwards Joe, my ass would be the first thing I protect."
541334,Headhunter,2011-01-19 18:03:00,5703,"Oh man, you have no idea!!! My wife suggested in November, when the trip was booked, that we take the kids out of school and go with her. Her hotel was right in Disney Land, right across the street from NAMM. Obviously I did not know that, when I declined... but I have been    since I found out... now I probably would have ended up in divorce court, as I can't seem me dragging a 7 & 8 year old around NAMM for two days, when they are pinning for Disney Land rides!!!!!! HH"
541336,stubbex1,2011-01-19 18:09:00,164,something about the first picture makes me to go a few rounds with the punching bag
541362,Harrison,2011-01-19 19:05:00,2202,"No idea who they are, but the guy on the left looks like a well used spinnerbait."
541365,Headhunter,2011-01-19 19:12:00,5703,LMAO! HH
541367,Joey,2011-01-19 19:24:00,9122,Well one has a red t-shirt with black star and another has black t-shirt with red star?  I have no idea who they are but maybe its a clue  Just rambling here .....
541373,mercman,2011-01-19 19:52:00,7054,COME ON MAN....its Dave !!!!!!!!!!!open the door man !!!!!!!!!!!    wow !!!! Daves not here....
541375,blaque,2011-01-19 19:58:00,2419, And they arent upside down! Might be a heavy metal christian band trying to oust the pentagram as the norm for metal symbology!!
541376,fishing n autograph,2011-01-19 20:02:00,2540,first pic looks like the Misfits
541381,Harrison,2011-01-19 20:17:00,2202,"I do recognize them, but can't figure out the name.  I think they are an Alaskan band however, as the guy in the middle looks part husky."
541382,Pikeslayer,2011-01-19 20:21:00,1443,I am pretty sure that the band in the first picture is 'Kill Hannah'. They are a somewhat well known/very popular 'EMO' band.  Pikeslayer
541386,blaque,2011-01-19 20:25:00,2419, Nah.......
541388,mercman,2011-01-19 20:30:00,7054,  
541390,Headhunter,2011-01-19 20:39:00,5703,Sarah and the Palins!? Sorry about that! HH
541395,Harrison,2011-01-19 21:00:00,2202,"Not sure, but I think maybe one or two members of Korn are in the first shot."
