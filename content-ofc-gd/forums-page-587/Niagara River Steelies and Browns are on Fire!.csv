541291,fishermccann,2011-01-19 16:10:00,655,"Thanks for that, what a wonderful fishing life you lead."
541293,Hooked,2011-01-19 16:26:00,891,"Wow, that is a whole lot O action!  Nice job."
541398,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-19 21:20:00,10439,HMMMMMMMMM................so that's what liquid water looks like. I had forgotten as I haven't seen any other than the stuff that comes out of the tap since October.
541099,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-19 00:48:00,655,"I spent Friday and Saturday fishing the lower Niagara River, and it was an absolutely awesome 2 days of fishing! Friday was like a sunny spring day, and Joe and Thom joined me for this beautiful January hammer fest  It was so mild, we didn't even wear gloves, and Thom spotted two mature bald eagles, which cooperated for a quick photo shoot.  The company was great and the numbers of browns and steelies were unreal on this unbelievable windless winter day. We shared some laughs and kept busy with multiple fish on most drifts, and a few double headers for good measure.  The hungry trout seemed to bite at everything we presented to them, but they did show a preference. The best baits were bow roe tied in pink, peach and white bags, nickel and quarter sized, and Joe's hot corky and streamer combo. The water was a perfect steelie green colour with about 6-feet of vis. The fish are scattered all over the river as is typical for the winter months. The ice flows were not that bad, but careful navigation was needed to avoid a repeat of the Titanic, albeit much smaller proportions. This is one of the reasons I own a tough Lund ProV and not a glass boat.  Saturday was a much different day. It was snowy, windy, damp and downright cold! Tony was quick to join me after hearing how Friday was, although the fishing wasn't as good for us. Roe wasn't working as well on Saturday, and my livewell full of shiners was not accessable with the frozen door. I didn't have streamers, and I didn't want to take my hands out of my gloves to retie and try different baits. After such a nice day on Friday getting spoiled, I was a wuss on Sat lol. We still got about 10 fish and we left early for a hot coffee. Still better than sitting at home dreaming about fishing  I saw Paul Castellano out there, and he nailed them as well. If you get the itch to hammer some chrome after viewing the pics below and your boat is all cozy for the winter, send Paul a PM. I'm sure he would be happy to have you out for some winter trout action.  Ok, enough talk, on to the photos and videos! Enjoy. BTW you can watch the vids from my Playsport pocket cam in full 1080p  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwEejme_WPg  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkpbGP_tOow                                                                              And Yamaha Joe by the end of the day Friday was known as Joe Brown, with the baddest streamer in the whole damn town lol   Glad you boys could join me for some Niagara Winter Wonderland fun, it was a blast!  On to some ice fishing for me now   See ya on the hard stuff!  Good fishing!  Aaron"

541113,Joey,2011-01-19 01:05:00,9122,  Me too    What a stellar report Aaron.  Now you got me wanting to go down there  Really love the colour of those fish and the eagles are amazing.  What is the green mark on the back of the one eagle?  Can't be a leaf can it?  Excellent  Joey
541118,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-19 01:12:00,655,"Thanks, that will keep me satisfied for a soft water trip for a while so I can go ice fishing now  Joey, I believe that is a tagged eagle."

541127,solopaddler,2011-01-19 01:29:00,8605,"Unreal Aaron, nicely done.  I was on Simcoe Friday perch fishing. No wind, brilliant sun, it was a very comfortable day. The fish were biting as well.  But all I could think of was  ""I should be at the Niagara right now!""  Guess I should'a."
541134,I'mHooked,2011-01-19 01:39:00,525,"Wow, excellent looking day! Great pics!"
541135,Joey,2011-01-19 01:40:00,9122,"  Ya, that's what I figured too Aaron, but I always thought the tag was a clip around their leg     Oh well, guess I'll have to Google that one"
