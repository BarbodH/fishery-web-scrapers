541700,irishfield,2011-01-20 23:23:00,26272,No dream... if you know the two perps involved Blair..
541797,kickingfrog,2011-01-21 03:58:00,8333," You made something that I will be trusting with my life, and its made 10x better then anything that I could have bought if I had been able to find one.  Don't spend that gift card all in one place."
541803,GoneFishin,2011-01-21 04:19:00,349,"If any one else wants to know where they sell them, the causeway bait shop in port perry sells some nice ones for 30 bucks."
541807,GBW,2011-01-21 04:24:00,8460,or Brian can make you one for a good 'deal' if needed.
541808,irishfield,2011-01-21 04:29:00,26272,Geoff.. lets not put his employer out of business!! LOL
541809,Cudz,2011-01-21 04:32:00,2652,Hey Brian very cool. Good luck Rob. Do you need anything else rob?
541810,GBW,2011-01-21 04:38:00,8460,I meant me...  LOL. He still needs to tell me if he want's the free ski's...
541811,fishnsled,2011-01-21 04:55:00,3520,A couple of class acts I'd say. Good on ya both.
541815,GoneFishin,2011-01-21 05:30:00,349," I don't work there I just seen a couple kicking around today. And I'm sure you don't want to start pumping out a full line of spuds for everyone on the board, but then again it wouldn't surprise me lol."
541895,irishfield,2011-01-21 15:07:00,26272,"Sorry GoneFishin.. but ""Geoff"" was GBW.. and ""employer"" would be Misfish's."
540526,kickingfrog,2011-01-17 18:31:00,8333,"Well it's been a few years since I've used my spud, and I can't find it.  Went to a few tackle stores today and struck-out. I'm going to call Tromblys in Orillia."
540535,GBW,2011-01-17 18:51:00,8460,why don't you PM Brian to see what he can do for ya?
540536,misfish,2011-01-17 18:52:00,29133,"Dont be going and doing silly things like that.When ya need it for? I,ll make ya one. You just got to pick it up."
540538,kickingfrog,2011-01-17 18:53:00,8333,Serious?
540539,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-17 18:54:00,10439," Yep, a 1"" piece of rebar with a chunk of 2""X3""X3/8"" plate welded to the end and sharpend does the trick for me."
540540,spooner_jr,2011-01-17 18:55:00,193,"I've had one of these for about 5 years, best chisel I've ever owned.  I think I paid $50 for it.  http://www.sportsmansguide.com/net/cb/jiffy-mini-mille-lacs-ice-chisel.aspx?a=242760"
540541,kickingfrog,2011-01-17 18:58:00,8333, Heading to Quinte (fingers crossed for weather) this Saturday. No issues picking it up.
540542,GBW,2011-01-17 19:00:00,8460,"whoa, look at that great offer. look's like I have to make a trip up in a few weeks to drop off a set of ski's..."
540609,Rod Caster,2011-01-17 22:30:00,5784,"My brother's got a heavy duty Cedar Spud with a 4 inch cutting end.... 3 wacks and he's through 5 or 6 inches of ice. You ""could"" make one..... but it sounds like MisFish has the best deal though!!!"
540610,cityfisher,2011-01-17 22:33:00,959,"Good idea for Quinte , the place that is Never safe"
540613,toca,2011-01-17 22:37:00,274,why cant i use a hammer?
540622,kickingfrog,2011-01-17 22:49:00,8333, That's how I feel about it. Plus living 3hours away I don't know what the real weather was like leading up to a fishing trip.
540623,Garnet,2011-01-17 22:49:00,2056,"Better than flat bar stock. Go to your local spring shop and buy a piece of spring steel maybe 10"" and weld to 1""pipe. Just the best. But don't pry with it."
540631,misfish,2011-01-17 23:20:00,29133," I dont pay for mine,but you are right,best and dont pry."
540672,uglyfish,2011-01-18 00:42:00,981,"lol i just made one at work. 4' length of 15mm rebar, put a piece on top in a T shape just incase it slips outta my hand it wont fall through the hole, and a piece of 5"" plate sleel, bout a 1/4"" thick and roughly 2"" wide, sharpened to a nice cutting edge, welded it all together and even had it painted a nice pretty blue.  cost me nuthin, infact, i was being paid while i made it haha."
540776,camillj,2011-01-18 04:08:00,1988,Awesome .. give ya $50 for it
540929,cranks bait,2011-01-18 17:15:00,721,"Because I do not have the resources to make my own, nor freinds that can make it cheaper than I can buy one.  I purchased mine at TSC.  The one I got was about 6' long and cost me $30.00.  They had about four different styles to pick from."
540988,misfish,2011-01-18 19:55:00,29133," Not true. I scrap pc heavy pipe,n/c,1 piece of brake spring,n/c.Handy welder near by,n/c.Eat lunch while working away on own time,n/c,do it all the time.1 spud ready for pick up Rob.n/c."

Yeah but then I would have to buy gas for the truck and all new ice fishing gear to be able to follow you out to one of your best fishing holes  .  And you live at least 4 hrs away from me.  I got the right friends, just in the wrong places"
