540155,kickingfrog,2011-01-16 21:04:00,8333,That's your best audio accompaniment yet.  Thanks for taking the time again.
540156,Terry,2011-01-16 21:04:00,14456,"no I didn't put it down the hole till the 3rd spot we went to, snagged it the old fashion way  if I didn't snag it I was going to put the camera down the hole      yeah I always edit the video , but today I just uploaded the raw footage"
540182,Joey,2011-01-16 21:58:00,9122,"Yes, it was a very perchy day, not many photos taken, it was dang cold out there in the wind.  Here are the pics I have of the day.  Notice the sun dogs           We left early as I wasn't too thrilled with the ice conditions at the second stop, only 4 inches.  Not enough for me and a snowmobile in my mind.  Hopefully the lake can make some more this week  Nice seeing you again Terry and Lloyd!!  Joey"
