He came close to being spooled a few times but percervered. How does one ever get a laker up on a stick and line?"
541071,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-18 23:42:00,0," Personally, if I have a big laker on I don't want to ""come close"" to being spooled but if that's how you old farts get your kicks be my guest."
541072,solopaddler,2011-01-18 23:43:00,8605,"Regarding the use of small reels for bigger fish, I've been using my 750 Daiwa Whisker for a long long time. It works great for whities and lake trout, most of the time.  For smallish sized fish it's just fine. A few years back I was actually spooled by a big laker (110 yds of 6lb test..gone).  99.9% of the time the smaller reels are okay. But if there's just a chance for bigger fish I'll use a larger reel now. Once burned, twice shy.  Bill has a point."
541075,solopaddler,2011-01-18 23:49:00,8605," That's quite a feat Wayne. Obviously it's not an impossibility, but more of a fluke than anything else.  By fluke, I mean no one in their right mind would purposely target 40lb fish through the ice with a micro rod and 4lb test.  You want to know why a stick and line works so well?  Even with larger fish if you set the hook fast and haul them up a bunch of feet quickly, many times they get for lack of a better word ""discombobulated"". Oftentimes they'll come in much faster on a handline because of this."
541096,Sinker,2011-01-19 00:42:00,8692,"I'm seriously laughing my ass off here !!!!  Everything from name calling to discombobulation in one thread.......that's gotta be a record!!!  The 750's are fine. I've fished with a line and stick most of my life, and I don't catch any more fish now because of my reel!!! Its not the fancy equipment that catches your fish!!! Time on the water is key....  Edit: There are lots of good reels out there. I personally, am a fan of the Pfleuger line of spinning reels. I find for the price, you really can't go wrong. Thier tough, and dependable. I haven't had a problem with any of mine at all. My go to ice reel is a Diawa Laguna. I've had it for about 4 years and I use it on softwater too. Works fine. Never an issue. I guess what I'm saying is, you don't want to cheap out on a reel, but you don't  have to break the bank either.   S."
541097,aplumma,2011-01-19 00:42:00,6896,ADVICE on a good ice fishing reel... I'm tired of using crap   Art
541104,smally21,2011-01-19 00:53:00,993,"if yer tired of using crap stop buying it.  5 or 6 crappy reels equals 150$, 1 good one equals 60-70.  i like the sedona in this price range and i use them year round at 750 for perch and ice, but 1000 or 1500 if there was to be just one.  the abu garcia cardinal is a nice reliable reel for the money. i dont fish enough ice to be a good source but im a long time shimano fan.  lots of hits on the sierra im think im going to have to try one.  good luck i think all of these suggestions beat using yer hands but good on the guys that do!  my hands get too cold to hold a beer can out there!"
541115,solopaddler,2011-01-19 01:07:00,8605," I know, I know it's a big word Shayne. I'll dumb it down for you next time.     Pretty much any quality reel will suffice. The only relevant thing I can add, if you're fishing outside a lot in sub zero temps, open up your reel, remove all the grease and lubricate with a quality oil. Quantum hot sauce is good.  Reels with a lot a grease get a bit sludgy in cold temperatures."
541306,Spiel,2011-01-19 17:17:00,9065," The biggest lakers I've ever caught all came through the ice on Simcoe, jigging spoons on a hand line that contained less than 200' of mono, heavy line mind you, no mercy once hooked.    Oh the good ole days."
540629,Familyfisherman,2011-01-17 23:11:00,188,"I've used multiple ice fishing reels over the last couple of years.  Most came with a combo, and were fairly low end.  This year I special ordered an HT reel -- it had 7 bearings and was the best I could find in their magazine, but last week I took it out to try and twice the line was caught in the roller  Not exactly what I was hoping for...I'll be returning it.  Any thoughts on a mid-range reel for WF and trout -- I usually use 8lb braid, fish are mostly 3-6lbs, largest last year was 21 but that's rare.  In the $30-$50 range would work.  Thanks for any opinions..."
540647,mercman,2011-01-17 23:52:00,7054,"Shimano sienna. Good quality reel, not expensive.I have one that i use occasionally ,now that i have gone baitcaster.Never used it through the ice, but great on open water in the summer."
540648,Victor,2011-01-17 23:53:00,1609,more bearings doesn't = better  I bought a 1000 sized sedona and i'm loving it so far. It's around 60ish.
540663,Sinker,2011-01-18 00:26:00,8692,"I use the same reels on my ice rigs as I do all softwater season. Some baitcasters, some spinning. Don't cheap out on reels for icefishing, they are the most important part of your whole set up out there, and the most likely to fail in the elements!!  S."
540686,buckster,2011-01-18 01:09:00,530,"I have to agree with sinker.  Most importat part of your set up by far... I use mainly shimano stradic, sahara, etc in the 750 size...  Perfect size for icefishing.  Not to bulky and it holds more then enough line for deep water"
540689,BillM,2011-01-18 01:13:00,17367," Some of the lakers and even whities in Simcoe go on long long runs, a 750 loaded with braid would be pushing it..  I'd definitely step up to a minimum of a 1000 or 1500.  Line also make s a big difference, braid tends to hold a lot more water then mono does and will ice up the bail roller in no time, no matter what reel you are using."
540690,kingofthesteelhead,2011-01-18 01:15:00,140,Bought a combo outfit at Canadian Tire for half price 2 years ago for around 29 dollars with an accucast reel model ACR104A and that has been the best icefishing reel I have ever had.What I do not like about MOST reels in the winter is when it gets cold the bail will not flip over which is very annoying. This reel has never done this!They have some combos this year again at Canadian Tire just waiting for them to come on sale again.
540700,ah_long,2011-01-18 01:36:00,354,"using a Daiwa Cross fire 3ib... around $22 in LeBaron..  the smallest size comes with an aluminum spool as well... so far it's working great this winter.. for that price, you can't go wrong.."
540703,Rod Caster,2011-01-18 01:40:00,5784,Abu Garcia 101i. It costs 30 some dollars at BPS or other venues. Good for ice and soft water imo. Holds 4-8lbs test.  I used it in -20 the other night (catching ling) and it didn't tighten up at all.
540707,Familyfisherman,2011-01-18 01:53:00,188,"Good advice folks.  I use ice braid, which ""claims"" to hold less moisture.  I also find at depths its sensitive enough to feel the very light bites of wf on bottom.  Gotta stick with that.  Thanks again..."
540708,mike rousseau,2011-01-18 01:55:00,4661,HT acucast is by far the best ice real I have used... $30  It is even angled specifically for ice rods... Due to the close proximity of the real and the first eye...  Those are my two cents... I really hope you go with my advice... I own 5 myself
540736,walleyejack,2011-01-18 02:56:00,358,"Best reel I found was on the end of my arms,price is right,dosen t freeze up,can be used year round,and low maintenance,stick  can't be beat,stick beats a rod out anytime. mtcw"
540743,cwpowell,2011-01-18 03:10:00,265,"I've got a Sienna 500 as well. I bought 1 in the summer for my ultra light, and then purchased another one for ice fishing, love this reel, really smooth, no problems and reasonably priced at 35-40 bucks."
540749,ckrb2007,2011-01-18 03:18:00,449,Don't skimp with your ice fishing reels. I use Shimano Saharas for my ice rods. I tried the HT accu-cast and did not like the drag at all. Although I do use them on first ice for perch. When fighting scrappy lakers you really need a smooth drag.
540750,Cudz,2011-01-18 03:19:00,2652,BPS has their Micro lite elite spinning reels on for $29.99 this week. Do not miss this. great little reel from what i have experienced.  jusy my $0.02
540757,Sinker,2011-01-18 03:35:00,8692," I've caught a few whities and lakers out of simcoe, and even a few from other lakes, and never been close to getting spooled with a 750 series reel. If a fish peels 100ft, I'd be impressed!! A 750 size reel will hold 100 YARDS of line, 300ft. More than enough!  Braided line is the cats meow for any water over 15ft deep. If your roller freezes, so be it, your drag will still work fine.  There are more lakes in ontario than simcoe!!!  S."
540778,camillj,2011-01-18 04:22:00,1988,Be a man !!! Hand line it all the way ... nothing more exciting than the feel of a big fish on a hand line ...

Maybe a little high for your price range, but I use it in the summer on my walleye rod too.  Well worth the money.  I just got an HT reel for my second whitie / laker rod this winter.  I've yet to catch anything big on it, so no comments there.  The drag seems to suck on it though, so we'll see.  It was a christmass present, so I aint complaining!  Good luck Kev.."

540896,adempsey,2011-01-18 15:50:00,1498,"Symetre for $80? Wish I could find them for that....  I have been using Abu Garcia 101's and 301's for the past couple of seasons and have no complaints.  I don't fish in a hut and only get out about 8-10 times a season.  I just picked up a Daiwa Regal Xia to try this year (the Abu Garcia's the store had in stock were ""acting funny"").  You should look into the Tica Cetus reels.  Although, I can't say I have ever owned one, people rave about them for ice fishing all the time.  The Pflueger Trion and the Shimano Sienna also seem popular.  Personally I didn't like the feel of the Sienna, so I went with the Daiwa.  Good luck!"
540907,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-18 16:07:00,0,1000 is about perfect size... i find the guides on ice rods are often not large enough to accomodate a larger reel
