Wondering if you guys had any issues fishing with this lenght of rod in a Fishtrap Pro (hitting roof on hookset)? My longest rod so far has been a 28"" and had no problems at all."
541721,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-21 00:06:00,2582,I have 26's and 28's and hit the roof with both in my fish trap pro and my fish trap scout. I wouldn't  think of using anything longer in my huts. But if you where concious of it and carefull I'm sure there would be no real problems.
