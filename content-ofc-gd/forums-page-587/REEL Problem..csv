541273,toca,2011-01-19 15:21:00,274,had the same problem with my browning. mine was a two part problem. had to clean out the grease from the gear and shaft. second part was to flush out the dirt from the around the bail area.   i use the quantum hot sauce. it works fine until you drop the reel in the water and it will stick until the gears start to warm up.
541277,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-19 15:32:00,0,"  hot sauce is the lube you need but almost sounds like the post that holds your spool or your reel handle assembly could have a slight bend or be loose inside, so when torque is applied it bites.  i had something similar on my daiwa ice reel.  it fell off the sled... i couldn't see the bent arm unless i looked ""reel"" close."
541279,toca,2011-01-19 15:41:00,274,had the exact same problem until i took the whole thing apart.  cleaned it from a-z relube and cursing at the same time(almost lost two bearings) put it back together and it was perfect.  but again each problem can be different.

541301,Roy,2011-01-19 17:03:00,13728,You call this a reel problem?
541305,skeeter,2011-01-19 17:11:00,1907,yes i do..lol if it was personal then it would be a REAL problem! not a reel problem.

541462,OhioFisherman,2011-01-20 01:57:00,6623,"Some, if not all grease will thicken in cold weather use, I would imagine vaseline would do the same. Probably not much of an issue if you are just dropping a lure down a hole in the ice, but it can effect casting distance on a bait caster."
