541074,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-18 23:49:00,0,we had a swede bore last time i went out and i fished the same 3 holes all day.
541221,SlowPoke,2011-01-19 12:41:00,2984,"+1 for Nils Master I never would have believed the hype if I hadn't seen it in action. As Jocyln says, you can be fishing before the other guy can have his gas auger started."
541228,skeeter,2011-01-19 13:21:00,1907,Well there seems to be a difference in opinion here. the fin bore3 seems to be in the lead. so i am here to set the record straight..... the best auger in the world is the auger your friend is using to cut your holes for you.   hands down I WIN !!!!!!!!!
541229,misfish,2011-01-19 13:21:00,29133," Especially if it,s Terrys auger,,,,,,,"
541454,bobowski,2011-01-20 01:21:00,360,I have an 8' FinBore III and it works like a charm. I too didn't know if I should get a 6 inch or an 8 inch but in the end decided to go with the 8 inch on the thought of how disapointed I would be if I lost a trophy at the hole because the hole was too small.
541499,porkpie,2011-01-20 12:19:00,2521,"4 years ago when I wanted a new auger, I bought a fin bore III and a Nils master, both 6 inches.  I actually bought the finbore first, and then unexpectedly found the nils in a bait shop that I occasionally frequented.  I picked it up figuring I could sell one if I liked the other better, and I had heard so much about the nils that I had to try it.  Long story short, I sold the finbore 2 weeks later, and I've never looked back.  It is without a doubt the best manual auger I have ever owned.  I have owned several different manuals, and 2 gas augers, both eskimo.  It is unlikely that I will ever need a gas auger again, but if I do get the urge, I will be buying the nils/tanaka gas combo.  I have 4 seasons now on the original cutting head, and it still cuts like the day I bought it.  I have pulled lakers and whities through the 6 inch hole with no issues!  I can't understand why the nils hasnt caught on like it did in the states.  It must be an availability thing, but then you couldnt find a marcum flasher up here when I bought mine.  I had to go to New York State.  Now Marcum is easy to source in Ontario, but nils is seldom to be found!  Anyhow, having owned both, my vote is Nils if you can find one!"
540947,bassjnkie,2011-01-18 18:00:00,1101,"I only go out ice fishing a few time a year and always rent a hut. This year I have everything but an auger, i'm looking for an 8"" or 6"" hand auger, but there are many out there and don't know which one to get? Would buying used be recommended? Thanks"
540958,Old Man,2011-01-18 18:24:00,822,"6"" Fin Bore for ease of use is my vote. A friend has one with the electric drill adapter and uses his 24 volt cordless drill. Works great."
540964,scugpg,2011-01-18 18:45:00,1373,I don't think you'll find a better auger than a Nils Master.
540967,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-18 19:00:00,2690,"Just picked up an 8"" Fin Bore III last week, works like a charm.  If you fish mostly for panfish and or walleye, get the 6"". Personally I stayed away from used, augers aren't really that expensive...well, the Nils gets up there, but, I figured for $89.99 I was buying new."
540970,bare foot wader,2011-01-18 19:19:00,1354,"you can get burnt on a used auger...regardless of the condition of the blades, if the auger has been abused and dropped on the head, drilling through old holes, etc it can throw the pitch off and you won't be cutting much ice with it, just spinning  i'd only buy a used auger if it had a conical blade on it, best hand auger IMO"
540973,bassjnkie,2011-01-18 19:23:00,1101,"Thanks all. I was looking at the Fin Bore III, but wasn't sure about size. Will 6"" be good for lakers? but I will probably fishing mostly for panfish."
540977,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-18 19:28:00,2690,"Six inch, would be pushing it for lakers.  That's the reason, I went for the 8""...some of those Simcoe ""greys"" can get pretty darn fat."
540982,beginner,2011-01-18 19:44:00,542,"I bought mine at lebaron 8"" pin bore last yr for almost 80bucks I think work  fine.. still used it today.. prolly drill 70 to 90 holes and still sharp..  but on the other hand I found this.. maybe you want it, i hope this help.. 39.99 for an auger is a best price..  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Hand-Ice-Auger/product/10219516/-1748839  hope this help..."
541002,torco,2011-01-18 20:37:00,656,picked up a 6 inch fin bore III at basspro on boxing day. It was only around $60 but having used it I now know why it is more expensive than my previous $45 model. It cuts through the ice like butter.  I have heard some guys say that they simply cut 2 holes close together and make 1 big hole with the smaller diamter augers. But if Lakers are your main quarry probably makes sense to go with an 8 inch.
541010,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-18 20:48:00,0," If ya need a bigger hole drill two holes side by side. An 8"" with thick ice(2') will start to hurt after a while. If you are like me and like to move around to catch fish go with the 6"". One hole will fit 10 pound lakers. Over 15 is where it gets tough...."
541016,misfish,2011-01-18 20:59:00,29133,"  Yep, just turn and it cuts by it,s self.And ya, I did the same thing.Cut two holes side by side by side and chip out the middle for years."
541017,misfish,2011-01-18 21:02:00,29133,
541018,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-18 21:04:00,2690," Guess I should have just got the 6""...oh, well, I need the exercise anyways"
541023,smally21,2011-01-18 21:39:00,993,"i have the fin 8"" - if i did it again id get the six  - always end up perching and the 8"" hole is a waste of effort!"
541025,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-18 21:45:00,0,"finnbore is the only way. swedebore is for people who like dull blades and enjoy working hard. personally i use a 6"" for lakers because of the number of holes i'll drill in a day, but any fish over 5lbs is gonna be a dance."
541026,bassjnkie,2011-01-18 21:46:00,1101,"Thanks for all the replies. After what I read here I'll go with the 6"" and if need be cut side by side holes. Will go to Bass Pro or Lebaron tomorrow. Thanks again."
541028,ah_long,2011-01-18 21:55:00,354,I have the finbore III 6 inch... never looked back
541035,Fang,2011-01-18 22:03:00,1330,"6"" all the way. I'll never drill through 2ft of ice with an 8"" again. My heart won't take it.  We timed cutting holes on Joseph last year - side by side 10"" Power auger vs my 6"" Finn Bore with brand new blades  It was close but the power auger cut 6 holes about 30 yards apart a minute or two faster than I could with my manual  Ice was somewhare around 14"" thick  Later that day I pulled a 17 lb trout through a 6"" hole - no problem  As back up I do carry a 36"" demolition hand saw that makes short work out of joining 2 6"" holes drilled side by side  Keep your blades sharp and 6"" is all you need"
541039,KelfuN,2011-01-18 22:18:00,246,fin bore III hands down!!
541040,Big Cliff,2011-01-18 22:27:00,6899,"Had power augers, had 8"" augers, 6"" will do just about anything you need. The difference between a 6"" and an 8"" (I worked it out and posted it on this board a few years back) is an 8"" removes about twice as much ice by volume than a 6"" (and requires about twice the effort to do it). the forumla is 3.1416Xr2X the thickness of the ice.  r being the radius (1/2) of the diameter of the hole  Example: for 6"" auger, 12"" of ice  3.1416X9X12=330.28 cubic inches of ice  Example for 8"" auger, 12"" of ice  3.1416X16X12=603.18 cubic inches of ice  In other words about twice the energy per hole.  If you are young and strong; well you choose which one suits you best. If you are like me, I'd rather drill two holes, one at a time than one big hole and be too tired to fish it LOL.  As for makes, they are all good if you take care of them properly. I buy a new set of blades for mine ($20.00) then keep them as back up. If my blades do get dull, I just install the new ones but a set usually lasts me about 4 years."
541049,misfish,2011-01-18 22:53:00,29133,"  Great post Cliff,,,,,,,,BUT,,,,,,,,,,,  Todays hand augers are way beyond what was made ""back in the day"". The finbor3 is the hands down, the best hand auger made to day.If treated right,it will last a hard water angler years, without changing blades.Less effort then the older style.You will notice there are two handles for turning,not one and a large nob on top.The fin is made to turn,not push and turn."
541051,BillM,2011-01-18 22:56:00,17367,"I have a 8in Fin-Bore for when it's early in the season and a Strike King power auger for when it's thick..   I'll agree that popping multiple holes with a 8in auger with 1.5ft of ice gets old really quick, lol"
541054,Muskieman,2011-01-18 22:58:00,2472,"I also have a FINBORE III 8"" with offset handle , and will race any stock 8"" gas auger for 1 hole start to finish on 8-10"" of Ice and beat it and the operator 95% of the time... 15 years ago , when I was in better shape, I used to race for 2 holes just to show off but not anymore.  the FIN hands down!  Randy "
541056,Big Cliff,2011-01-18 23:01:00,6899," Doesn't matter which auger you use (admittedly some are better than others) the difference in energy required between a 6"" and an 8"" hole remains the same. I have a Swedbore, it was within my price range, it was available, and while there may be better, it does the job for me. Mind you, I drive a Subaru not a hummer LOL."
541062,misfish,2011-01-18 23:15:00,29133," IMO it does matter.  You use your swedbor,then try a finbor(weather it be 6 or 8 inch).You tell me???? Im just say,n. You drive a Subaru???Sorry to here that.LOL  J/K"
