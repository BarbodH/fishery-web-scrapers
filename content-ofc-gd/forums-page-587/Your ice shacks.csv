541116,Rod Caster,2011-01-19 01:09:00,5784,  Is that open water right beside your shack or just black ice Lakerguy??  Nice shacks OldMan!! That homemade cheapie is awesome!  Blair... cant' wait to try your shack first hand. How's does she handle with the sled?
541237,lakerguy,2011-01-19 13:50:00,224,   That would be black ice
524718,Rod Caster,2010-12-02 20:24:00,5784,"Every few years my father and I will make a new ice shack out of random available materials. Some have turned out strong, light and durable while others have been less than stellar. The last one we made was out of thin cedar 1X3's and with two people we could haul it out by foot, although we still used the sled to pull it. Lightweight has been our motto now that he's aging.  I'll post a picture once I find one.  I'm sure there are some interesting and inovative ones out there.  "

524862,Rod Caster,2010-12-03 02:35:00,5784,           It's a bit crude but it works...maaaaan does she get warm!
524873,Fisherman,2010-12-03 03:43:00,7201,Better not let the wife see that frying pan...imagine the potential smack you'd get with the length of that handle..but ya right into the next century..
524877,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-03 03:57:00,203,"Wow, nice ice shacks   And that sure is one heck of a frying pan hehehe"
524883,Nipfisher,2010-12-03 04:19:00,2449,Here is my little 5 x 7 red shack I have used for the last 3 years. It is light and easy to pull around. Heated with propane and now has a 20 pound tank that hangs in a milk crate on the back. One of the side windows isd a slider for ventilation. It is perfect for 2 guys but with the dog and my 2 boys it is tight. I'm up-sizing this year and may have some new pics by Sunday afternoon (10 x 12 with bunks).

524921,Rod Caster,2010-12-03 13:18:00,5784,"  Ok that's just not fair. I think that guy spent more than me renovating my condo! In fact, I'm gonna take some ideas from that shack and put them in the condo...   Nice shack NiFi. Quaint, light and efficient...easy to pull and warms quick. Lots of memories for the kids in that thing I bet.   Yes that frying pan is a beast. I dare anyone to try and steal my massive pile of perch on Nipissing."

526587,skeeter,2010-12-08 22:36:00,1907,"if we post pics of our huts then maybe the members here will recognize them when there out on the lake , and drop in for a visit. located straight out from alcona.    although it will look a little different this year as I'm going to be doing some work on it shortly... 2' taller, and lots of interior remodeling."
526652,Jewelbee,2010-12-09 01:23:00,422,"Wow ...these are castles !!!! In my ice fishing days, we used a couple of cut saplings and a bed sheet for a windbreak!!! LOL!!!!"
526670,GBW,2010-12-09 01:59:00,8460,"You all know what a Clam 2000 looks like?  That's all I have...  However, I may print out the OFC logo and put it (with GBW written under it) in a window for this season.  If you see that, feel free to say hi.  I may see some of you out on the ice on Scugog, 4 Mile and Simcoe this season then."

527023,Rod Caster,2010-12-10 03:06:00,5784,Nice shack skeeter. Now that's an original.
527027,skeeter,2010-12-10 03:28:00,1907,Thanks Rod Caster. i will post pictures of the before and after when i get it remodeled.
540715,Old Man,2011-01-18 02:07:00,822,"Made this one out of scrap and recycled lumber and building materials. Doesn't look like much, but it was cheap (less than $30 not including the stove) and it's warm. Parked it on the lake out front of my house for those days I don't feel like going far with my portable.    "
540718,Old Man,2011-01-18 02:13:00,822,My portables.    
540769,Nipfisher,2011-01-18 03:58:00,2449,"Here are the pics of my shack. I'm sorry I did not post them in this thread earlier.              It has been completely re-wired and now has two 6'4"" beds in it. Currently at South Shore on Lake Nipissing but probably heading to Callander Bay. Yep that's a bathroom."
540774,toca,2011-01-18 04:06:00,274,nipfisher how much do you charge for rent and does that include utilities and cable?
541014,Nipfisher,2011-01-18 20:57:00,2449, No charge for OFNers. If I get it into Callander Bay this weekend It will act as headquarters for the gtg on Feb 5th.
