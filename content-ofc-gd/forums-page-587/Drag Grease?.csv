541478,NANUK,2011-01-20 03:22:00,797,I don't know where to find Cal's grease here but for Shimano you can call their service centre in Peterborough 705-745-3232 I used to have some Cal's grease but now I use Super Lube Multi Purpose Synthetic Grease on all my reel parts and drags and it seem to work better then anything else I have ever tried. http://www.super-lube.com/synthetic-multipurpose-grease-ez-49.htm Super lube has PTFE (Teflon) same as Cal's but it does not freeze to -45*F  and impervious to salt water as well. much superior product IMO for a lot less $$$.
541558,Lunker Larry,2011-01-20 17:36:00,122,Thanks Stonefish. The product looks good. Did you buy locally or did you have to order it?
541583,PainInTheBass,2011-01-20 19:07:00,102,"I have and use Cal's Drag Grease.  I ordered it from Smooth Drag, and it wasn't any trouble getting it at all.  It just took a little while to cross the border.  Typically, different parts of reels (baitcasters at least) use different viscosity lubes based on the component.  Cal's Drag Grease is more viscous than reel gear grease, which is more viscous than bearing oil.  I have used Cal's gear grease on the non disengaging levelwind idler gear in my round Abu, and it definitely affected the reel's feel and performance. I have not used the above mentioned product, and am not making any claims to it's application.  I am just giving a heads up."
