537938,irishfield,2011-01-11 14:40:00,26272,It'll be some hard thought.. moulds aren't cheap..only savour is that I should have a free (read someone else paid for it years ago) tool base around somewhere that might work. Still talking thousands of dollars though in tool room expenses....
537940,Raf,2011-01-11 14:45:00,3495,yeah those & spreaders in general are pretty much useless for anything over 7-8 lbs.
537957,bigbuck,2011-01-11 15:15:00,2449,"Thousands of dollars?? Ok, maybe not."
537961,irishfield,2011-01-11 15:21:00,26272,"LOL Buck... If you're gonna do it right and run production quantities.. a 4 cavity mould for even the smallest part generally hits 18 to 30 K. This one is automatically at least 2 cavities.. one for each side of the spreader....  I'm like Raf though... I've never used a spreader in my life, but if people wanna buy them ...."
539281,JimC,2011-01-14 14:22:00,86," hey Irish .. looks like people do (wanna buy them),  judging from some of the comments in this thread. Tis unfortunate that your moulding / tooling costs would be so extreme,  but it is what it is.  Howz about keeping this idea on the back burner,  and plan to target 'TARGET' as they move into Canada.  If you could get a toe-hold in there,  or CTC, Walmart, Pro Bass etc.  who knows.   but I guess it comes down to funding the startup costs, eh?  In the meantime ... I shall remain hopeful."
539315,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-14 15:44:00,0,"If someone has a part, I can make a 4 or even 5 part mould for a better price Wayne.  but then I never use one myself anyway. you risk having the fish swim away with the spreaders in it's mouth....  Nope Never seen that happen..."
539318,irishfield,2011-01-14 15:48:00,26272,"Yah I know you can Andy... but nobody could afford to buy them, with labour in, hand pouring each one !! lol"
539327,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-14 15:57:00,0,  not sure what yer thinnkin about...cost is minimal...but my time is worth tons...lol. It would be 5 at a time and the cost would get cheaper for each one poured. On a smal scale it would be cheaper for a small business to produce. no machines and very little overhead.  but again....not worth my time pouring speaders..lol

536519,JimC,2011-01-08 17:05:00,86,"It was plastic, very light,  when you squeezed in would rachet up one notch at a time,  then easy to release. Haven't been able to find anything like it.   Tried CTC,  Pro Bass (on 400), and a couple of small tackle shops. Those wire, spring loaded ones are crap, imho. My buddy loved that thing, and had it a long time.  he forgot where he got it (gift? or purchase?) Left it in my rubber net after dealing with a very large Pike last spring ... I didn't see it ... washed the net out ... well you get the idea. I felt bad.  Any help to source a replacement would sure be appreciated."

536532,Gerritt,2011-01-08 17:24:00,6129,looks like a hemostat to me...  not a jaw spreader
536549,JimC,2011-01-08 17:55:00,86,that's what I like about this forum ... everybody's a Comedian!
536872,mercman,2011-01-09 02:43:00,7054, He's right. It doesnt look like a jaw spreader. Looks like surgical pliers or a hemostat. Try looking online a BPS.  http://www.psfishing.com/jaw-spreader.html  thats a jaw spreader.  Paul
536876,kickingfrog,2011-01-09 02:48:00,8333,"Look again guys. As the ""loops"" are brought closer together the tips spread apart. The ""ratchet"" part is the perpendicular piece near the loops. My brother used to have a pair."
536940,HTHM,2011-01-09 05:11:00,4082,And then he got married.....
537006,JimC,2011-01-09 14:53:00,86," Exactly ... they may look like something else,  but trust me,  they were the best darn jaw spreaders ever.  Too bad your 'bro' lost his too.  Paul - thanks for the tip;  however,  that type of jaw spreader although effective,  is pretty unforgiving, imho ... especially for a younger fish you plan to release.   Still a better option (for the fish) than just ripping the hook out of a Pike's throat, on such occasions when it's a deep (hook) set.  So please keep me in mind guys n gals ... in your travels,  if you find a retailer that carries a jaw-spreader like the one pictured, please PM me or use:  [emailÂ protected]        Thanks."
537014,kickingfrog,2011-01-09 15:12:00,8333,"My brother thinks he still has his, he's looking. They may have been Normark or Berkley and they may have come ""free"" with a fishin' magazine subscription."
537016,JimC,2011-01-09 15:15:00,86,Trying to add a BIGGER pic here to show more clearly how this tool works.  edit:   well that sucked ...  obviously I am no expert at editing pictures.   That one should have shown larger.   oh well. 
537046,Dondorfish,2011-01-09 16:18:00,1000,"  Just ""click"" on the picture in your post - it comes up on a new page almost life size.   Tracker (Don)"
537079,JimC,2011-01-09 18:43:00,86,"  thanks, Don;   however,  for whatever reason,  when I click on the thumbnail nothing happens.   Now it (the first pic) DID expand once,  but now I can't get it to repeat.   gotta be something in my settings I guess,  or the browser (Firefox). I dunno."
537082,Dondorfish,2011-01-09 18:46:00,1000,  Must be - mine opens to the full width of the 22 inch screen. I will keep my eyes open for them in the tackle shops down my way (Niagara).   Tracker (Don)
537110,Alumacraft,2011-01-09 20:03:00,139,"Hey Jim these are the same as you had I believe.They are a great pair of spreaders for small too medium sized Pike/Muskies. Closed  Half way opened  Fully opened   Jim the only thing I can tell you about these spreaders is what's written on the side.It says ""The Grabber a Fishing Tool"" and a "" U.S. Patent NO. 261546 "". There is nothing else written on them.  Jim I've had these for 10-15 years so I do not remember where I purchased them. I lost mine for a couple of days while shore fishing for Pike a few years back and I was bummed out, so I know how you feel.Luckly I found them. As for replacing them all I can say is goodluck I have been searching for years to buy a couple of backup pairs. If you do find some let me know I would like a couple more pairs.  Goodluck in your search Rob"
537120,irishfield,2011-01-09 20:18:00,26272,"Could you check that patent number again Rob? 261546 is a 1888 patent for a hyrdrocarbon generator.  If I can find if the patent is still in force, or not in force.. might be something worth making a mould for at the plant."
537135,Gerritt,2011-01-09 20:37:00,6129,I got the same result as you Wayne whenn I searched the USPTO.. seems there is  no exact match for that patent number.. but what I was able to find was this...  http://www.trademarkia.com/the-grabber-73290912.html  However I cannot find anything on  Grabco.  G
537160,JimC,2011-01-09 21:13:00,86," Yup,  that's it alright.    thanks for the info, and the Great pictures;  but it doesn't look good for me to find a replacement. Grabco, Inc went belly-up according to this >>>  http://california.14thstory.com/grabco-inc.html  Only chance is probably at a flea market,  but you never know.    Guess there will be a few of us now,  checking our sources.   Everybody likes a challenge, right.  As for my technical problems getting the thumbnail to open,  it works for me using Internet Explorer (but not Firefox) ... haven't tried Chrome yet on the ol laptop,  but it will probably work there too.  Thanks for everyone's input.    Hopefully, some of these will turn up,  or someone else will get the specs and start making them again.   Maybe we'll see'em on Dragon's Den."

537166,Alumacraft,2011-01-09 21:39:00,139,Irish I double checked the patent # and that's what written #261546.  Irish if you do happen too mold and make some let me know I'll take a couple of pairs.  Rob
537389,JimC,2011-01-10 13:11:00,86, I would definitely be interested as well.   hmmmm ... sounds like a business opportunity might be evolving.
537670,walleyejigger,2011-01-10 23:55:00,876,"i also had these many moons ago, had got it at the sportsmen's show way back when,..... you know, when it was good, loved them but a cousin dropped them overboard, never seen them sold since"
537674,GBW,2011-01-11 00:03:00,8460,Make them open a bit more too Wayne (if you make some).  Nice and wide so a big fish can't crush them down.
537926,bigbuck,2011-01-11 14:24:00,2449,"Wayne, if you do think about making these, put me down for 6. That way I can give them out as presents for our annual Muskoka Pike Opener in May to the boys. They look like a pretty decent fishing tool. I think with just the sales from OFC'ers, it would be worth someone's time and effort. Also, if whomever gets Muskies Canada on board....... It could be a fun way to make some extra cashola."
537935,farsider,2011-01-11 14:35:00,456,"I am not so sure about Muskies Canada.  These look way too small for Musky and for most Pike as well.  Cheers,  Mark"
