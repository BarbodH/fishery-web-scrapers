I am heading up to a buddys camp at the end of the month and was looking to get some frozen fish to use as deadbait for pike on his lake.  I've only come across gutted/head off fish in the freezer depts of the grocery stores i've been to.  I have seen larger sardines for sale with the heads, but I'm not sure how well those would work.  Will the headless ones work well enough? If it matters we're heading up to the Massey/La Cloche lake area.  ryan"
540604,Rod Caster,2011-01-17 22:24:00,5784,"I've only seen whole frozen smelts for sale in Alberta, where live bait is illegal. You may find someone who has them in their own freezer but it might not be an easy task.  Maybe with a well matched jig head and a trailer quick strike hook, the gutted smelt would work???  This spring, net some smelts and keep them in your freezer., smelt fishing is SOOOO much fun  ..I've got some beauty chub I'm keeping for lakers and pike this winter.  "

540885,Woodsman,2011-01-18 15:25:00,1286,I agree as far as live ones. Can you show where in the regs that you can't use dead smelt? I doubt you can.

540962,Old Man,2011-01-18 18:33:00,822, The link you posted doesn't work. Page 10 of the Ontario Fishing Regulations says nothing about using frozen smelts.

Especially good for lake trout from shore in the spring when the trout are looking for easy pickings.  They're usually available whole.

541162,vinnimon,2011-01-19 03:10:00,2593,"Check the fisheries act to be sure about using them for bait. In the summary it may state no organic baits. Which includes live or dead animals, plants or part of. Call the local mnr office to be sure.  Now another ?  on the same topic. Smelts that get washed up and caught between rocks on shore. Can they be used for bait in that same waterbody, that doesnt have a restriction on organic baits. They are there naturally."
