The lake is polluted with small panfish and perch!!! Hard to find the bigger ones but with a flasher u will get a ton!!! Use the standard tiny stuff with a couple waxies. the crappies are scattered as usual. the walleyes are not numerous. there are tons of small hammer handle pike - but they r not as reliable.  I would set a tip up for pike nearby and then just have at the panfish/crappies - really small minnows have been good for pike so they say.  Landry"
