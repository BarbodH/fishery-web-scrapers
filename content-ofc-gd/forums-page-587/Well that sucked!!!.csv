540240,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-16 23:58:00,2050,"This report has been FOUR MONTHS in the making.... And I wish it turned out a little better.  Made plans with a bunch of great OFC'ers and good friends to hit my local pond for some panfish this weekend.  Last week Rich (bbr) aka slim 2.0 hammered them real good so I had high hopes.   I haven't done a serious day of fishing since the fish a thon over 4 months ago so I was stolked to get out... Picked up Rich in simcoe at 6:30 headed to st.williams for minnows then home to get averie and our gear and off to the lake to meet up with Frank and Juli. Long story short, I very rarely get skunked here but it has to happen to all of us! haha it was great to get outside with Averie and some really great people regardless of our results!  Rich got a few good perch right off the bat and some oos largies then it shut down!.   We marked fish all day but couldn't get them to commit..... Normally we'd run and gun a bunch more but it was tough getting around today!  2 funny things:  1) my little battery quit working for my hummingbird so I decided to drag my big dep cycle out.... HORRIBLE idea... Frigging heavy  2) Frank is like 6'2"" - big strong guy and it was his lovely little lady who helped me drag the hut around all day! lol Thanks Juli! And thanks to frank for pulling Averie around a little!  Slow bite meant Averie had to rough it with strawberries and her favorite movie, Jurassic park   This was the sight all day... Fish on the graph and no takers   Picture didn't turn out to well but Juli and Frank workin it!   Averie bugged me to take her to our goby spot so she could lay a beating on them for a bit!   Rich with a monster OOS largie   Rich should chime in with a perch pic at some point... Good work - lucky to out fish me..... Again.  Frank I never showed you my transducer setup so here's some pics...      Thanks for com in out guys! Hope to see you again soon!  Cheers, Ryan"
540243,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-17 00:06:00,2690,"Thanks, Ryan!!  We still had great time. By the way, Juli needed that exercise...insert image of me ducking, lol!! I'll add a few pics in a little bit. Rich kicked all our butts, he deserved it for being out in the elements all morning/early afternoon!!"

540246,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-17 00:08:00,2050, Don't let him kid you he spent a little time in the hut with Averie and I!
540249,bigugli,2011-01-17 00:24:00,6138,The young one is a real cutie.  We all get a bad day once in a while. Got to pay the piper sometime.
540250,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-17 00:27:00,2050, Are you talking about Averie or Juli?
540251,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-17 00:29:00,2690, Thought he was talking about me!!!!!
540253,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-17 00:31:00,2050, hahaha
540255,bigugli,2011-01-17 00:40:00,6138, I'll pm you later sailor
540259,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-17 00:47:00,2690,"Added Photos  Ryan, Averie, and Juli...with Rich rushing out to nail some fish, way ahead    Ryan trying to get Averie to drill another hole for him...    Rich, fishing and praying, lol!    Changing spots    Ryan, Averie, and Rich    Me having fun with my new auger    Juli in the hut, finally figured out why we had such hard luck, today, was that pink/black Leafs toque she was wearing     Juli did lose a really nice perch at the hole shortly before we left.  We'll get 'em next time, guys.  By the way, Ryan, thanks for picking up the minnows today!!!"
540261,vinnimon,2011-01-17 00:52:00,2593,? for yas. Are the stocked species open all year? or no? Im thinking no. On that pond that is.
540267,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-17 01:04:00,2690," That's a big no, Vince.  Can only keep panfish out of there during hardwater season."
540271,vinnimon,2011-01-17 01:09:00,2593,"  I figured that, thanks Frank. Its above the @#@#@ area. Thanks"
540322,Leecher,2011-01-17 02:51:00,7832,If it's any consolation Ryan.... I haven't got into any fish this season so far in my first 3 outings    so don't feel so bad about it.... at least you were out with great company  Give my favorite fisher person a great big hug!!! I'm sure that you guys will get into them next time around Thanks for sharing Jacques
540338,Cudz,2011-01-17 03:19:00,2652,Hey Ryan.  Cool pics.  Love the video idea. Sorry to hear about the lack of fish.
540402,Rich,2011-01-17 12:45:00,3927,"Not sure what all the complaint is about, I was getting bit pretty regularly all day. :-)        Ryan stealing minnows from the local vendor. He took 5000, but left a 10 there so its all good.  (JK! LOL!!!)    Base Camp    One of the several fish that fell victim to my Kastmaster.  You know, there was a joke made of me being out in the open all day. But that really is why I caught fish. I kept moving, kept changing tactics, kept bombing spoons.. in turn - kept getting bites.  That said, after a day of drilling non stop holes and freezing my bum off in the open - I wish I got skunked comfortably in a hut. LOL"
540423,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-17 14:13:00,2690,"  Think you are ""bang on"" with why you had more hits, Rich.  On a wicked cold front day like yesterday, they sure aren't moving much...so it pays to find them. I had a little spurt of decent action, in the first location...must have tried almost everything I had in my ice fishing tackle box, but that was it. Sure was cozy in the hut, though, lol!!"
540441,Harrison,2011-01-17 15:08:00,2202," Love this set up, car mat, DVD, heater, chair and strawberries....  I am going to steal this, my 4 yr old Cassidy would be in heaven(and quiet).  DVD would have to be ""Coraline"" though."
540443,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-17 15:12:00,2050," LOL Averie is scared of Coraline, but has no problem watching Dinosaurs eat people!"
540573,danbouck,2011-01-17 21:04:00,4380,WORST REPORT EVER!!!
540579,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-17 21:14:00,3761,"Lot's of great photo's Ryan, great write up too buddy, the Humminbird looks nice...I got to find myself a finder  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
540657,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-18 00:15:00,2690," Hurry up and get healthy ""pneumonia boy""!!!  We'll get you out there for a skunking too, lol!!!  Nah, next time we nail them!"
541268,Harrison,2011-01-19 15:03:00,2202," That's funny.  Coraline's a hit with her, had to hunt down ""lulaloopsie (sp?)"" dolls with the button eyes.  To be honest, like Averie, I find'em kinda creepy too."
