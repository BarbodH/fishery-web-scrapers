1000077,John Bacon,2017-04-12 02:15:00,3277,I wonder how they will compare to RAM.http://scottyfishingproducts.blogspot.ca/2017/04/sneak-peek-new-scotty-ball-mounting.html
1000147,Hedfish,2017-04-12 19:11:00,76,Looks interesting!
1000159,Dara,2017-04-12 19:50:00,3052,Scotty makes pretty good stuff and Ram needs some competition
1000183,misfish,2017-04-12 22:02:00,29133,I would like to see mounts that would grip on a tube. Like my toon. All their bases are flat mounts.

1000220,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-13 06:21:00,8243,I have Scotty rail mounts 1 on each side. It is flush to the gunnel rail and won't catch some very important body parts like the ones that stick up.
1000223,misfish,2017-04-13 11:15:00,29133,Thanks JB.  Found them. Now to find them at a store near by. CTC maybe.
1000226,wkrp,2017-04-13 11:53:00,656,Scotty is a great Canadian company that makes great gear.
1000230,fishindevil,2017-04-13 12:34:00,6254,i had the chance to see and use a prototype and they are awesome .......many uses and different set ups.....
1000239,John Bacon,2017-04-13 13:15:00,3277,Thanks JB.  Found them. Now to find them at a store near by. CTC maybe.  The Scotty rail mount with a Carbon 16 would look on your toon
