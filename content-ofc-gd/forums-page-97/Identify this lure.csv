It's different from the model available now but I seem to remember that they changed it at some point.  It's about 4.5 inches long.    
999663,OhioFisherman,2017-04-08 18:00:00,6623,It looks like a knock off of a floating Rapala?
999666,kickingfrog,2017-04-08 18:17:00,8333,"It was good enough that when rapala bought storm they changed it. It's plastic, not balsa and has a single large ball bearing rattle."
999667,misfish,2017-04-08 18:25:00,29133,You have it right Rob. Thunder stick. I remember when they came out. They looked cheap IMO. I stuck with buy husky jerks.
