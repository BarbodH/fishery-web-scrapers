999941,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-11 01:05:00,8243,"Don't even think about a Tracker. Many that own them say they are fine what I see out there on Bass Pro's showroom floors are a disaster when it comes to fit, finish and quality of materials. Even Lada's were shinny coming off the assembly lines in Russia.  I read that you want to put 4 people in a 16' boat. You better max out on HP if you want to do that. It will also feel like you are in a sardine can with 4 on board.  I have to give you this, you like shopping. For what you want, like it or not your budget is 5 grand low for what your wish list is. You say boats are over priced on Kijiji, not really they are selling for what the market will support. My neighbour just sold his 2004' 16 foot Lund with a 90 Yamaha for a few grand more than he paid for it 10 years ago, in 4 days. We used to bring boats and cars north from the US, now the trade route is going the other way, especially late model pick up and apparently now boats too. A pick up 6 years or newer are all going south at a 40% profit so says my GM guy. They are basically giving me 75% of what I paid in 2012, problem is a new truck of the same model is that much more money. I saw a 2017 F-150 1/2 ton today with a sticker price of $72,000.00 plus, plus. A pick up truck and not a Ferrari. I wouldn't want to be 21 again and starting out in life that's for sure, I have total empathy."
999943,FishFinder17,2017-04-11 01:19:00,139,"Not sure what a black anchor is. Theres a 2004 Tracker Targa listed with a 115. Its a 17.5' boat. Little older than I was looking, but has the size and space Id need, and the price is right.  I know people arent crazy on tracker, or mercury lol. This has both.   I owned a 1989 16ft tracker aluminum with the original 30hp Johnson. I put down new floor/carpeting and rewired the whole thing but structurally it was a great boat. Someone who owned it before me must have hit a rock but it was repaired and never had an issue with that spot. Sold it for more than I paid+invested so I can't say anything bad about tracker boats, but that's just my experience.  However staying away from Tracker does seem to be a common theme in a lot of boating/fishing forums..maybe there's something to it."
999946,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-11 01:47:00,8243,"Like many brands of most consumer products quality and workmanship seem to have slacked as it also may have when it comes to Tracker boats. Looking at how they are built on the showroom is proof, I can't believe these are the best that they have to display. And they have always came woefully under powered from the showrooms, getting you to upgrade and thus the price gets to what it should be. I remember reading the adds for Trackers in the 80's in the Sun and drooling over them and the prices, thousands below other boats new. I remember also the old timers at work explaining why a 25 HP wouldn't move a 17 foot boat with a full wind screen very well. A 16 foot like FishFinder has with a 30 HP would be very underpowered in my opinion. We are rebuilding a 16 foot Smoker Craft and it is going to have a 90 on her. I think the Transport Canada tag max says 115 Horse.  A black anchor would be an old Mercury engine, thus only good for an anchor. A white anchor a Johnson a silver anchor a Mariner. Old boat guys jokes."

999956,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-11 06:28:00,8243,"TJames, that G3 and Polar Craft Moxie gave you leads for both look good on paper. Not exactly down the road to go take a look. The G3 is exactly like Italo Labignons and he loves it. The advantage of it is the wind shield, especially for keeping the family dry. The disadvantage is the windshield. Extra weight, less fishing room with less HP with that 90. The Polar Craft is a good quality vessel, many say no, that isn't my opinion but I have never owned either, my opinion comes as a passenger and a fisherman and not an owner. The biggest plus for it is the extra room to fish and a 115 Horse O/B. But the kids can't hunker behind the full windshield, nor your wife. I chose full wind shield over working size for the sake of my 1st mate and haven't regretted it, especially when the wind is up and the water is cold. Buddy Ted has a 21 foot Star Craft very similar to mine but a walk around, he stays dry but no one else. Get to Quebec ASAP. Both are very nice boats, tough choice James, very tough to choose, condition, condition, condition and a splash for certain. Running a boat in the driveway and running her in the water under load can make a huge difference. Like idling a car in a driveway and going out on the 400. I would lean towards the G3, you can always swap out the 90 for a 115 in 10 years but you can't make her longer. When the kids are almost full size you can upgrade then or get smaller kids.  Are you good to tow it with what you have now? I got a new truck out of my deal just for towing, the old 1/2 ton wasn't the truck for my 19 footer with it's age and 500K on her, as much as about brakes than her weight capacity."
999957,GBW,2017-04-11 06:33:00,8460,I didn't look at either link but G3 is Yamaha I think and when I was in the market a few years ago it was the top on my list.  The wife nixed that and now she's and ex and I have a different boat   But the G3 series/brand looked well made BUT never rode in one.
999958,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-11 07:04:00,8243,"Ex's usually come with a new car or boat in the foreseeable future Geoff, sometimes with a soon to be future ex, sometimes all 3. If I liked them I refer to them as former, ex is so harsh a word."
999962,AKRISONER,2017-04-11 13:01:00,5558,"Thanks guys. Seems a lot of manufacturers put 60hp motors on boats of similar size, I guess Ill run into this issue regardless of brand.  I was looking at a new smokercraft 161 xl (the 90"" beam), and it also only had a 60hp motor. Its a bigger boat with same engine.  my buddy has an underpowered 16 foot smokercraft with a 60 on it. the thing cant get on plane with 1 person on the boat, it just frigging bounces around and feels like you are getting into a car crash every time you hit a ripple of water. I hate the damn thing.  Also the finishes are garbage, the carpet is wearing entirely off all over the place and the front deck is rotting out. Not a fan at all."
999971,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-11 15:06:00,8243,"An older Smoker Craft is being rebuilt at the shop right now. It isn't that old either and came in like she was rode hard and put away wet. They don't seem to age well. It will be a nice boat once done, basically a body off restoration if it was a car. I voted to have it blasted with crushed Corn to the bare Aluminium and won the vote. I want to see any cracks, loose rivets under all that paint before we put a young family in it on the water."
1000067,moxie,2017-04-11 23:50:00,1566,"Those were just a couple of examples of what is available if you're willing to put in some road time. My Crestie was an American boat this big boat marina in Sarnia purchased along with an Ultracraft and they both sat there for a few months under the shadows of Boston Whalers and Sea Rays. Called for info, set up an appointment and headed to Sania to look at it, second time for a water test and the final trip was to tow it home. The deal was more than fair and the marina took care of the paperwork on their end. All I had to do was show up, pay and sign. Good luck."

Princecraft, Smokercraft, Princecraft would not honour their warranty on a cracked hull while still under warranty and they are all bling and nice paint but have a nice wet ride. Smokercraft pure junk. Had two 14 fters at the cottage and both were leaking within 2 years from the same location. sold them and replaced with StarCraft, No issues. Never owned a Tracker aluminum but there junk as well. Even my local tracker dealer sells Crestliners and no tracker aluminum but sells Nitro line of glass boats. I have a 14 ft Rebel lund with a 25hp for bush fishing and its tough as a nail, but is an 89. The newer lunds are way over priced if you ask me. Save your money and be patient and buy used. Let someone else get ripped off on the price of a new boat. I have looked at the Kingfishers and am really impressed with them. If I was in the market for a tinny I would be looking at them for sure. Might have to go to B.C. to find a used one. Lots of them out west. They used to be called Harbourcraft before they went together with Kingfisher."

1000316,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-14 02:22:00,8243,"To answer the OP's actual question. My favorite brand of boats is a StarCraft. There are many SC owners and I have never heard of one complain about them, mine is going on 23 years old with the original 115HP Mariner and original everything else, I think Sinker and I have basically the same boat. Ooops I have a complaint. The zipper on my convertible top is stuck I found out today and the 23 year old rug is worn at the fuel filler, a bit. I don't tend to abuse mine cosmetically because it is probably my last boat. I've had plenty of Kudo's at the ramp. Last week I was offered more than I paid for it 9 years ago. Then what am I going to do? Replace it for more than 50 grand?  There are currently 4 StarCraft's in our group of fisher buddies here. Mine is he newest, the serial number says 94 the registration says 95. The production year of your boat is the last 2 numbers on the serial number stamping. Most aluminums serial numbers are stamped and riveted on the starboard side on the transom. Glass boats serial numbers can be found on the port side inside the splash well usually."

I had a MGR from KingFisher call into my work one day and we spoke for about 30 min on the boats (my job is to sell him a service he's looking for but I changed that up quick when I looked at the caller ID).  You could hear in his voice how proud he was that a guy from ON was aware of the brand and how passionate he was about the brand.  Worth a look for sure if you can find one that doesn't take days to get to travel time wise.

993133,akaShag,2017-01-31 22:46:00,2073,"Interesting read.  I have owned a pile of boats and motors, never anything bigger than the old (1966 model IIRC) Starcraft Holiday 18' which today would I believe be classed as a twenty foot, since they seem to measure from the extreme edges instead of the waterline these days.  And no motor bigger than a 120 Mercruiser.  Having said that, when I was in the market the last time I was looking, I had a VERY PRECISE idea of what I wanted, what I needed, and what I liked.  And I asked the Head of Mechanical Engineering from an Engineering school about the difference between fiberglass and aluminum hulls.  He asked me, did I ever pull the boat up on sand or a rocky beach.  hell, yes of course I do, I am a FISHERMAN!!!!!  He said, ""Doug, buy aluminum.""  (And I don't run fifty miles an hour in heavy seas, so the ride is less important for me)  I bought a new Sylvan 16 footer, and a new Honda 40 HP, put them on a top-quality trailer, and never looked back.  I did put the high side bunks on the trailer for recovering the boat by myself in strong side winds (that was the best money I ever spent on a boat accessory).  I would never buy an outboard that is not a Honda.  These things are quiet, don't stink, run forever on a tank of gas, and none of them ever gave me a problem.  Oh, except the one time I dropped my 7.5 hp kicker on the garage floor, that was a problem...............but my fault.  Lots of great advice here and mostly from people that have very clearly been there, done that, got the t-shirt.  The folks that are emphasizing that the OP needs to do his homework have absolutely got it right.  And that goes double for the folks that advise you to make sure you can TRAILER it with your vehicle, and STORE it wherever that will be.  I had to put a swing tongue on my trailer to fit in the garage of this house when we moved here - but I knew that before I bought this house!  Good luck!Doug"
993166,RyanB,2017-02-01 03:20:00,6,The G1 was also an option for me but I figured with the new model it would have a better resale value if I ever needed to sell it than a model that's been in existence for 15+ years already.   Both motors actually now have a 10yr warrantee also or a 6yr warrantee+free controls...I opted for the 6yr as the gauges and controls for the G2 were just over $3000 but like I said above...it was still actually cheaper than the same boat with the 150 four stroke Merc.   Now just the long wait for delivery in aprox 8 weeks

Will traded his Lund in for a Polar Kraft because he liked mine so much.  I will match up my boat with any Lund, etc as far as ride, quality, fit and finish at a lower price.  Take a look here at the warranty that Polar Kraft has on the ""V"" model boats which come with MarineDeck PTP that carries a LIFETIME warranty. Check out other boat to see if they match that warranty. Also if buying used search out Rotting Transoms on many used Lunds. This is a known problem that Lund has tried to shy away from for years. Also search out on the Internet ""Pitting Holes"" on Lunds. Get a model if you can that has not had these problems.  Lund is still a great boat, don't get me wrong. However, many of their smaller models are not what they use to be ever since Brunswich took over.  Don't get caught up in the Name Game or you might be paying more for less.  As far as Beertech not getting up on plane fast enough, well it sounds like outboard issues not boat issue.

A boat is not quite like a car, you might trade your car in every few years, but boats tend to stick around a bit longer.  The one you're looking at might be a good fit right now but you might also wish you had more power a year or two down the road.

Anyways, there was a few brands that stood out to us, but without a ton of knowledge about boat brands and reputation etc, I feel a bit unsure. We were leaning towards Lund, Lowe and Legend. They all offered a similar boat in a similar price range. All of them had a rear bench foldable, with 60hp motors, trolling motors. It was pretty important for the boat to seat atleast 4 people.

999887,Tjames09,2017-04-10 17:07:00,664,"Thanks guys. Seems a lot of manufacturers put 60hp motors on boats of similar size, I guess Ill run into this issue regardless of brand.  I was looking at a new smokercraft 161 xl (the 90"" beam), and it also only had a 60hp motor. Its a bigger boat with same engine."

Next boat would be a dual console or full W/T Aluma or Star craft of at least 17 ft as a 16ft of the same config kills a tonne of space.

992802,Tjames09,2017-01-26 22:13:00,664,I think the reason I looked at the brands I mentioned is because they offered rear bench seating which could fold down to a casting deck. In and around the 22000 mark. Other boats with seating for 4 seemed to be about 28000 or higher

992891,Lape0019,2017-01-27 16:16:00,647,I know quite a few other manufacturers offer a flip down rear seat. I do not on the other hand know the price ranges. The boat that offers this that has always caught my eye is the Crestliner fish hawk. I don't know why but I have always loved that boat. I'd still buy a Lund before the crestliner though.

992990,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-28 21:28:00,8243,"JohnBacon, you are bang on. Not only because a smaller boat may fit in a regular garage anything larger than 20 feet can be a challenge to trailer it. Both because of weight especially in a glass rig and maneuverability can be an issue as well. A 20 plus footer takes up a lot of space in a city driveway too. When I was looking for my ideal boat of 15 to 17 feet of aluminum Lund, all the good ones were not for sale, the ones that were good were hard to find and none were a Lund.  We did go to the Boat Show the year I bought and it was crystal clear that I wasn't buying a new boat for my budget unless I bought a good tinny with a 9.9  4 stroke or a underpowered over priced 15' Tracker. For what they wanted for a 14' Lund or StarCraft tinny with a 9.9 and zero options I bought the Superfisherman 190 in showroom condition loaded with options including 2 sonar units plus a GPS combo, 24 volt Motor Guide and a very good CD/radio. Oops forgot the top of the line VHF with the 6 foot areal."

992992,SuperDave,2017-01-28 21:58:00,204,"2 years ago I went to the boat show looking for a new boat. I ended up with a Lund 1775 Impact. This is my second Lund. The other was a Mr. Pike 16"". The Mr. Pike was a great boat had it 15 years was just ready for an upgrade. I looked at Princecraft, Lowe, Smokercraft and Lund amongst others. All these boats are great one way or another. I was very picky about a few things and Lund had all the answers. Size was determined by budget and garage space. IMO you can't go wrong with Lund. What you can go wrong with is the dealer. Find out from other boat owners the dealers reputation. It helped me make the right decision!"
992993,aplumma,2017-01-28 22:34:00,6896,"The maritime laws and requirements over 18ft are different at least here down here in the South. A distress flag is good to 18ft but flare devices are needed over 18ft. The rating of loaded weights and insurance should all be considered before up grading. I have a glass Ranger and a Xpress aluminum jet boat. Don't  kid yourself you can put a hole in an aluminum boat. The Xpress  is a .100 gauge boat which is 5052 aluminum and I was running a set of rapids and popped a hole in the back lots of water in a 2"" hole. A Nerf football jammed in the hole got me back ot the dock and a quick welding made it whole again. The big difference between the two in my eyes is the Ranger rides on a pad and has very little of the boat in the water so it rides smoother than the aluminum boat. The aluminum boat is designed to draft 4 "" on plane with a larger wet surface so you will feel the waves more. I installed a suspension seat in the Xpress which takes all but the most brutal jarring. I have 4 boats all of them are designed for different types of water which we have available within a hours from where I live so pick the water you fish the most and match the boat to that water.

992659,grimsbylander,2017-01-25 17:21:00,3016,"Craig,  Every V boat has a keel. I believe what you meant to write was strake.

Not every aluminum V hull has a keel. They all have a centerline seam, but not a keel.  "
992683,craigdritchie,2017-01-25 22:12:00,1586,"Craig,  Every V boat has a keel. I believe what you meant to write was strake. The Keel is the centerline of the boat. under the Bow where the hull comes to a V is the keel. Any other ribs  on the bottom of the boat is a strake.   The keel is a physical structure that's either attached to, or configured into, the bottom of the hull to provide directional stability. A seam down the middle where the hull plates join together is not the same thing.  Most boats have one keel, usually made from heavy extruded aluminum, which is attached over the center seam so it can serve a dual purpose of providing directional stability while also protecting that joint from physical damage. Usually T-shaped in cross section, a real keel is quite unlike the stamped seam caps that are sometimes passed off as keels due to cost-cutting measures. Boats may have multiple keels, normally one down the center and one or two more at the back on each side, although specialized race boats might use multiple keels, none of which are located on the centerline.  Some V-hull boats use a one-piece lower hull which is folded along the centerline. While the fold gives the hull a V shape, that fold itself is not a keel either, and doesn't give the boat the kind of directional stability that a proper keel does. That's not a knock against one-piece bottoms, by the way - I quite like them, especially when they then have a proper keel attached.  Strakes look like a keel but serve a different function. Keels provide directional stability, while strakes are normally attached closer to the chines in order to provide additional lift. They're also widely used on pontoon boats, which otherwise are more prone to plow through the water than plane up over top of it.  In cedar strip boats, a ""strake"" is one line of wood strips that runs continuously from bow to stern.  Bottom line to all of this is still the same. Pay attention to the construction details to be sure you get what you think you're paying for. The retail price means nothing, it is quite possible to pay a lot of money for a second-rate product."

992693,jjcanoe,2017-01-26 00:01:00,744,"As far as being one (or more) boat types married to a certain engine, what's to stop you from buying the boat and trailer without the engine, the driving to the engine maker of your choice and having a different engine installed?  The first boat dealer is NOT going to turn down your money... the engine place will GLADLY take your money and install their engine on your boat..... just saying!  I've had limited experience with motors, both have been Mercury, 1st was a 1995 40hp 2 stroke oil injected, it came with my first boat. It was 12 years old when I bought it, only ever had one problem with it, in 2014 the stator died when I was on vacation in Bancroft. Died on a Tuesday morning and was back on the water on Thursday afternoon. Had my choice of 3 Mercury dealers within 15 mins of our trailer. Moral of this story is, consider how far you might have to drive for certified parts and/or service. For example, non E-tec certified dealer are not allowed to work on E-tec engine without voiding the warranty. A 20 year old motor will have parts break or wear out more than a new one, (well duh!) Most new motors, doesn't matter the brand, are way more durable and reliable, than motors built 5 or more years ago. If you plan on buying a brand new motor, most of the stories you hear about old crappy motors always breaking down etc. are not really valid (mine included). You will get a nice reliable motor of what ever brand you pick if you buy new. Comparing an old motor to a new one is like comparing prune juice to bacon, just not an equal comparison."

992722,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-26 03:18:00,8243,All very good points made here. My StarCraft is powered by a 115 Mariner which is a Yamaha/Merc hybrid. I have found that Merc mechanics are becoming more rare. Mercury has very specialized tools and not all dealers are willing to invest the bucks for them. There is no longer any Merc specific marine parts/repair place here in Haldimand and the closest dealer to me is almost an hour to Simcoe at Proctors Marine.  Having a dealer to service locally is important. Buying a boat in cottage country may save some money but having to tow it up there for warranty service gets expensive if that's their policy.

992740,fisherman7,2017-01-26 12:43:00,325,"One thing I found out at the boat show last year was the Lund was bought by Merc, so they only come with Mercs. I would have bought a Lund but I wanted a Yamaha or Honda on the back. Still could have done it through the dealer but the cost went way up. Apparently Merc has bought Lowe as well.  Anyway, found a used 2011 G3 (Yamaha's boat brand) with a 115 on the back. Awesome boat. Now I just need to be awesome at fishing."
992579,porkpie,2017-01-24 22:52:00,2521,"If the Glastron is a cottage type cruisers, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference.  Our runabout is a mid 90's glass boat designed for the cottage sunbathing set.  It rides like a bag of crap, matter of fact my boat will take chop better than it does. On the other hand my buddies Grady white 24 with a 250 Yamaha will eat Lake Ontario 5 footers Like they aren't even there.  Just different purpose built glass boats."
992585,Lape0019,2017-01-24 23:46:00,647,"I'll stick with the boats you mentioned. Everyone will have their preference but to me, you essentially listed the boats in the order I would look at or consider buying.  1. Lund 2.Lowe 3. Legend.  Now, Lowe and Legend have come a long way but Lind to me is king of the list. It's a better build. If you don't want a merc, there are dealers that will rig it anyway you want. It will cost a little more though. I don't know why everyone knocks a Merc though. They have the largest dealer network around (easy to find a mechanic) and I haven't had a lick of problems with mine. If you are looking at an HP size if 60, I don't really think the make of motor really matters, yes, it'll break down but the bigger the motor, the bigger the chance of blowing no matter what brand you buy. In the end, treat them right and they will last a long time."
992586,spincast,2017-01-25 00:06:00,3279,"Starcraft or Alumacraft. Love my Suzukis. You don't mention budget which is a big factor. I had a 16 foot Starcraft walk through and a 50 4 stroke.  It served most needs, even with four in it - other than big water. Not enough freeboard  or power for that.  If you think you want to do the big Lakes with 4, I would recommend at minimum an 18 fter with a minimum of a 115. Aluminium is cheaper to tow and power - so those are factors to consider too. You can make some sweet deals this time of year if you aren't set on a single brand or set up. Look and ask for the non current models - they don't always put them in the show, and see if you can get a couple guys bidding against each other.. I made a sweet deal on mine a couple years ago - a month after the show with a guy I met at the show..... good luck"
992588,Pigeontroller,2017-01-25 00:21:00,2793,"Nice thing about Alumacraft is no corporate alliance, get whatever powerplant you want on it....Yamaha, Merc, Suzuki, Honda, Evinrude...  If you can find a new Lund and a new Legend equipped the same way for a similar price for gosh sakes buy the LUND!"
992591,scugpg,2017-01-25 01:04:00,1373,Going new I'd be looking at alumacraft or starcraft. Don't like how your limited to motor options with the Brunswick fleet. Would take a Yamaha or Suzuki over a Merc.
992593,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-25 01:29:00,10439,"Would take a Yamaha or Suzuki over a Merc.  HMMMM, why is that? Have had a Merc on my boat since '91. Re-powered in 2013 and put on another because the first was so good to me. Haven't heard any issues with the Zuke's but have heard some with the Yammies in the salt (exhaust manifold corrosion issues). I think pretty much all motors are on a level playing field these days."
992595,jjcanoe,2017-01-25 01:50:00,744,"I was in the same situation as you 2 years ago. Went to all the boat shows,had a list of things that I absolutely needed in a boat, had a list of things that would be nice on a boat but not necessary. Research you purchase 110%. Look at the wieghts of the boat motor and trailer, can your vehicle safely pull it, with all your gear trolling motor batteries, anchor, a full tank of gas etc. It all adds up.  I've got a wife and 2 kids, pulling a tube behind the boat is now a must, 5 years ago, not so much, do you need bow cushions for sunbathing?  Some boats have this option some don't. A flip down rear casting deck take up a lot of floor space when in use, whereas folding jumpseats don't, but give you a bit smaller casting deck. Livewell size, fuel tank size, rod storage, under deck storage are all things to consider (visualize what you will store where when you're using the boat to give yourself a better idea as to what you need). Things like a stereo, fish finders, gps are all expensive dealer installed options and are probably the very cheapest model available to make the price look slightly better and most likely not what you want. You will be upgrading these things yourself very soon. You can add these things in for half the price yourself later on. (I did) So, at the boat shows open every hatch, stand on them if they are on the floor, some are flimsy, some don't open fully with a seat in the base next to it (believe it or not!) Look at the dashboard space, will you need a ram mount for a fish finder over 5""? Can you see all the gauges or does the wheel block them? Most boats have a battery compartment up front for your trolling motor battery, can it hold 2 batteries for a 24volt motor or just one? Does it have lockable storage areas? (even one is better than none) Is there enough room on the front and rear casting decks for the type of fishing you do? Can you add accessories tracks for downriggers, rodholder etc.? Travel cover, mooring cover included? Radial or bias ply Tires? Spare tire Included? Bimini top, or full foul weather enclosure included or available aftermarket? Portable or fixed gas tank? On board battery charger? Are there enough/any cup holders! I was originally looking at a 16' side console with a 90hp but ended up with A 17' walk through with a 115hp. I narrowed my choices down to a Lowe and a Crestliner. Went to a dealer, checked out both models I was interested in. Went home after both places wrote down pros and cons of each boat. Compared them to my list of must haves and nice to have. Checked other dealers (of the same brand) and Auto trader (boat section) daily, most dealers advertise on it, waited until I saw the boat I wanted at the right price. MOVED ON IT IMMEDIATELY! (This is important!) Be ready to buy and don't be afraid to drive a bit to get it.  I live in London and drove to Kingston for the right deal. I started my search in January and picked up my new boat in mid July, (4 days after I saw it posted online) patience paid off for me. Ended up with a 2015 Crestliner Vision 1700, 115hp Mercury 4stroke (reviewed as one of the best built 115hp engines ever) Are there things I don't like about the boat? Sure, mostly minor things, but they are outweighed by the positives. So far it meets all my needs, (great lakes trolling, fishing small cottage lakes, pulling a teen on a tube) couldn't be happier with it!"
992596,Terry,2017-01-25 02:08:00,14456,i too have never had a bad merc  and would buy and recommend  them

992602,grimsbylander,2017-01-25 03:54:00,3016,"Well with that I can recommend Mercury without hesitation. The ones I know are run often and run hard. And since I'm a friend of my friend, I can say I also run Mercury...on my 4th and would love a new XP. That doesn't mean I wouldn't try a G2, they're amazing outboards."
992603,GBW,2017-01-25 04:27:00,8460,"One thing you didn't say was with the ""4 adults"" is pleasure boating and slow comfort rides part of this or is it ""just for fishing""?  I have an 18.6 Glass bowrider that can be rigged with a trolling motor.  The rig is a Northstar then became Grew and who knows what they are called now.  It's powered by a Johnson 115 FastStrike and ZERO issues here, not even with the impeller.  Sure mine doesn't have a back casting deck but the seating area design let's 2 people (mainly my kids) fish from the back on either side of the boat and have a more stable lower to the water casting area.  I stand up front on the V bench and can add a removable deck over the seats if I ever wanted to. I also have a 1970's Lund 14' tinny.  Made so well it still to this day doesn't leak a drop. What would I do today if I had the cash to go out and change it all up?  Not sure. Depends on my current needs and future needs.  You don't have kids yet I'm going to guess.  Think future use too for if you ever go down that path...  Nobody want's to buy a boat every few years cause things have changed at home..."
992604,irishfield,2017-01-25 05:34:00,26272,"Well if we're going to get stupid.. a friend of a friend of a friend of mine told me that they've never heard my 275 HP Merc Verado run!  The best boat.. what ever one you're in with a fishing rod in your hand!  Motor... GM/ Ford / Dodge... they all build a lemon.  10 FULL seasons in the water now with my Lund (6 months IN the water, not on a trailer).. as I missed one when Jen was sick.. and it has yet to leak a drop. Many that have fished with me know that I definitely don't baby it, especially in November / December out for Musky as we regularly ride or bust through 6 to 10 footers on GBay and generally wash the floor over the 54"" bow doing so!  Pick the one you like and go with it. Don't buy a Legend...."
992613,Tjames09,2017-01-25 11:51:00,664,"Thanks for all the replies. The boats I was looking at were about $22,000. I don't intend on doing any great lakes fishing with this, it would be all in the Kawarthas. All the boats we saw had Mercs on them, and didn't seem like anything else was even an option.  Thanks for the good reply jjcanoe.  I dont recall seeing Alumacraft at the boat show, its the only book I dont have lol. Are these brands all affiliated: starcraft, smokercraft, alumacraft? I recall seeing the starcraft and smokercraft booths. The boats looked identical."
992619,scugpg,2017-01-25 12:55:00,1373,Personal preference. Tend to like the features more on others not to mention the looks if that matters.  I've owned a Merc too (though was a yammy powerhead) and had 0 issues.  Agree most are same reliability these days.  Don't liked how your locked into buying a Merc with many of the brands now w/o paying up charge.
992621,Andy,2017-01-25 12:59:00,330,"A Google search shows that StarCraft and Smokercraft merged in 2006. Sylvan is part of that group too. And I believe other companies occasionally use hull designs from other companies. I think Smokercraft built the hulls for Legend at one point. And certain companies like StarCraft have had a number of owners over the years. I had a 15.5' Smokercraft. A great little boat. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another, but it would depend on price. Not up to the standards of some companies. I have a 16' StarCraft with a walk thru windshield and it's a very solid boat. 90 hp Optimax. Unless I do something really stupid, it should last me my lifetime. It's decent with three adults, four is too many for a full day on the water. I have a friend who owns a camp. He has a Smokercraft and a Lund. The Lund is definitely the better boat, but costs more. He had a Princecraft. I thought it was better than the Smokercraft, but less than the Lund. I tend to place Lund at the top, StarCraft and from what I've heard Alumacraft as close behind. Then Princecraft. Legend, Smokercraft, Sylvan come after. No experience with Crestliner. Good luck."
992622,G.mech,2017-01-25 13:09:00,830,"I found this old post from Henry Nguyen from Legend boats:    I was also researching the Brunswick Corp deal with Merc  a bit and according to what I found it went down like this.  Brunswick previously owned Mercury and then started buying up the Lund, Princecraft, Crestliner brands.  Yamaha decided that they would not sell motors to these boat builders any more since they were basically 'competition'.  Evinrude then followed Yamaha's lead and cut off these factories from buying their engines.   As such, you can not buy any of these brands from the factory with these engines.  Aftermarket customizing is possible if you can find the right dealer."

992627,AKRISONER,2017-01-25 13:45:00,5558," I think we're talking apples and oranges here if a 1993 Glasstron is the comparison boat. And as for clipping a rock and sinking?... you could chainsaw a hole through the bottom of my Ranger or a Skeeter and it's not going to sink. I understand like all of us, your knowledge is based on experience, but the glass boats built specifically for fishing are incredible. If you get a chance to get out in one, take it.   just saying, ive seen a holy punched in fibreglass from the shield, and have yet to see a rivet pop or a hole punch in an aluminum.  I unfortunately havent had to opportunity to fish a skeeter or ranger, but id obviously take someone up on the offer if made.    I will add to the anti merc sentiment...we have a 350 mercruiser on our rinker...and a 175 johnson from 93 on the glasstron. The merc is a pain in the you know what. Ive kind of lost a lot of faith in domestic built anything anymore, and i drive a new dodge ram lol.  Our ski-poos have also been nothing but trouble...surprise surprise."

They reveal everything about how the boat was made. If you take one thing away from  this entire thread, let it be this - during the recession a lot of boat companies made HUGE changes to the way their boats are built, because with sales being down, cutting costs was the only way to keep generating profits for their shareholders. As a result, there are a lot of boats out there today that are no longer built anywhere close to the way they once were.  How do you make sure you get what you pay for?  1. Here's a simple thing - are the cleats through-bolted, or just screwed on? If the builder took the time to actually through-bolt them properly, then it's a safe bet they didn't cut corners anywhere else. But if they're just screwed on with simple wood screws, where else did they make compromises?  2. Look at the transom. Does the wood go to the floor? Or is it just a strip where the motor bolts on? It's cheaper to just have a strip. But it won't last anywhere near as long.  3. If the boat has a full walk-through windshield, then how does it attach to the consoles? Is it through-bolted? Or just screwed on?  4. Do some research online and find out how they put in the foam flotation that's required by law. Some builders install the floor, then inject expanding foam underneath it, so it fills every crack and space. Others  just lay in flat sheet foam, or pour in non-expanding foam, then bolt the floor on over top. This method is cheaper, but the problem is that it leaves air spaces, which water can then get in to. The inevitable result is rot and mold issues, which can then deteriorate the foam itself. But water can't get into a boat that's been injected with expanding foam. It's a BIG difference.  Besides that, the expanding foam bonds with the hull and deck to give you a solid, rigid structure that equals a smoother, quieter ride.  5. Sounds crazy, but does the boat even have a keel? Have a look because some don't. Others cheap out and only have a center cap where their aluminum plates attach. Others do it right and have up to five proper keels. Guess which boat will track straightest? Guess which one delivers more protection against rocks?  I could go on all day, but since I don't get paid for this, I won't :-)  Suffice to say that the world has changed.

992655,Lape0019,2017-01-25 16:58:00,647,"Craig,  Every V boat has a keel. I believe what you meant to write was strake. The Keel is the centerline of the boat. under the Bow where the hull comes to a V is the keel. Any other ribs  on the bottom of the boat is a strake."

992530,Tjames09,2017-01-24 15:21:00,664,"Went to the boat show and feel more overwhelmed with choices now than before. Thought I new what I wanted in a boat but I honestly feel less sure now. I was looking for something simple, a side console, 16 feet and enough power to move around the lake. My wife felt a bit differently and was thinking more friendly to having 4+ people on the boat which increased the budget and different boats, all of which were full walk throughs.  Anyways, there was a few brands that stood out to us, but without a ton of knowledge about boat brands and reputation etc, I feel a bit unsure. We were leaning towards Lund, Lowe and Legend. They all offered a similar boat in a similar price range. All of them had a rear bench foldable, with 60hp motors, trolling motors. It was pretty important for the boat to seat atleast 4 people.  Do you guys prefer one brand over another? Is one brand considered more reliable?"
992532,dave524,2017-01-24 15:35:00,4508,"In aluminum I would add Starcraft/Smokercraft as well. For 4 adults I would think serious about upping the size to an 18' , especially if you want to fish 4."
992534,AKRISONER,2017-01-24 15:58:00,5558,alumacraft...lund quality at a lower price. Plus they are gorgeous  we just got one and its the best boat I have ever been in.  fished a smoker craft...not a fan at all feels flimsy  my starcraft tinner has been bulletproof. 15 years old and looks new to this day.  Yamaha outboards...nothing but problems with mercs
992535,BillM,2017-01-24 16:05:00,17367,"I've only got first hand experience with two, Legend and Lund.  The Legend was a 15ft widebody and was a fantastic boat (Purchased around 2004 I believe).  Very well biult, never leaked a drop and we beat that thing pretty good.  Second boat was(is) a Lund 1700 Pro Sport.  Handles the big water with ease and for us is the perfect fishing machine.  Small enough I can drop it into the lake on even the worst of boat ramps (Or no boat ramp at all), big enough to handle the Great Lakes and Nipigon when they whip up out of the blue.  Both boats had the max hp ratings for the hull (40hp 4stroke Honda on the Legend, 115 Yamaha on the Lund, along with a Yami T8 High thrust kicker)."
992536,NANUK,2017-01-24 16:06:00,797,"Another vote for Alumacraft, I own a Crestliner for the last 13 years and very happy with it too, Yamaha all the way for the choice of motor. Go with walk through full windshield for the family."
992537,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-24 16:18:00,10439,Got to admit I like the looks of those Crestliner boats like the one Charlie Wray runs. Same with the Princecraft the Fishin' Canada guys run.  My boat has been a really good one as it's now 26 years old. It's a Fisher and the best thing about it is the lack of wood. Only the transom core is wood. The floor is all carpeted aluminum.  I agree with the sentiment that an 18 footer will be better  for a family of 4. A walk through with a standup cover will also keep the fam dry and happy.  Have fun with your purchase.
992539,G.mech,2017-01-24 16:26:00,830,"Lund, Lowe, Crestliner, & Princecraft are all owned by the Brunswick Corporation who also owns Mercury.  I don't think it's impossible but ordering any of these brands with anything other than Merc power is very, very difficult.  That said,  I have had two Princecrafts both with with Mercs (one 115 Opti and one 150 4 stroke) and have had zero issues with either of them but would probably have bought different engines had I had the choice at the time.  Point is, you don't really have 100% flexibility when mixing and matching brands of boats and motors unless you want to do some customizing especially with controls & wiring harnesses."

992541,NANUK,2017-01-24 17:11:00,797,I like the fact that you can get any brand of motor with Alumacraft or Starcraft. Ranger makes one of the best Aluminum boats IMO but they are super expensive.
992542,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-24 17:12:00,8243,"My first choice is StarCraft, I have a 21 year old Superfisherman 190 and it is like new, Second would be Lund, The question is like what would you prefer, GM, Ford or Chrysler as well as all the European and imports for Asia? That's a lot of choices. If you ask a boat owner their opinion they will most likely say the boat brand they have is the best.  I have been in most all of the brand boats mentioned here. Pal has a newer Prince Craft and he isn't too happy, small things like the glove box lock broke, carpet lifting in spots.  In order to narrow your choices down determine your budget and look what you will get for the money.  I would not buy new, slightly used will save you thousands.  Whatever you do stay away from a Tracker boat, scrap."

I duck hunt and fish from it, so it sees a ton of abuse. Still going strong. I will probably have it until the day I die, then my son will abuse it some more. I'm thinking I may upgrade my engine this year to a new yammy 40 tiller, but for now I have a yamaha built mariner 40hp tiller which has also been bullet proof.  I have been in many  Lunds similar to mine, and the lunds do ride nicer in rough water, and they are a bit dryer for a tiller.  One thing for sure, if you plan to have 4 ppl in your boat with a full walk through, you are going to want more power than a 60hp. At least a 90, and make sure to max out the HP rating on the boat. It does make a huge difference in handling, especially in tight quarters, and rough water.  I really like the looks and layouts of the alumacrafts, but i haven't been in one on the water.  IMO, a deep and wide 16ft boat is the most versitile rig there is. You can do a lot with a 16footer from big water to small water, easy to tow, easy to maintain, and very fishable.  S."
992555,captpierre,2017-01-24 20:37:00,2521,"Aluminum boats come in riveted and welded The better boats have double bottoms and ridged ""I"" beams beneath the floors rather than ribs. Ribbed boats will end up leaking sooner down the road. I have a Lund now for 10 yrs. no problems. My last boat was an entry level ribbed boat. Leaked badly after 10 yrs. Met a CO on Nipissing a few years ago with a Crestliner. Welded. That's big water and he said they beat the crap out of it. No leaks. Bigger the boat the better. More HP needed and harder to tow and store. Big decisions. Watch Kijiji"
992557,grimsbylander,2017-01-24 20:42:00,3016,"Yeah, you really can't compare a glass boat vs alum for ride quality.  It's a whole other level.   Glass is in a different category all together and is far superior to the ride of aluminum in any kind of water.  Bang on information. Aluminum has it's advantages over glass but ride isn't one of them."
992558,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-24 20:51:00,10439,"   Bang on information. Aluminum has it's advantages over glass but ride isn't one of them.  Correct, glass is quite a bit heavier so it gives you a smoother ride.  Aluminium on the other hand being lighter you need less motor for the same kind of performance, is easier on gas and towing. And the big one for me is the ability to beach it in shield country without chewing the crap out of the bottom."
992560,AKRISONER,2017-01-24 21:00:00,5558,"Have you even been in a glass boat? Only reason I ask is because if you have, you would know there is no comparison with glass and aluminum on big/rough water.   been riding in a 93 glasstron nearly my entire life.  maybe im just biased because i havent rode in a lund or alumacraft under 18feet long?  my only experience under 18 was in a smoker...and that thing is terrible.  the ride comparison to me is not that substantial enough to overcome the peace of mind that an aluminum can clip a rock and not sink. Most lakes are rocky around here unless you are south or east."

Most lakes are rocky around here unless you are south or east.  I think we're talking apples and oranges here if a 1993 Glasstron is the comparison boat. And as for clipping a rock and sinking?... you could chainsaw a hole through the bottom of my Ranger or a Skeeter and it's not going to sink. I understand like all of us, your knowledge is based on experience, but the glass boats built specifically for fishing are incredible. If you get a chance to get out in one, take it."
992565,G.mech,2017-01-24 21:15:00,830,"One other thing to look at between the aluminum walkthroughs  is the windshield location.  Some have a much larger foredeck and smaller cockpit than others and one may suit your needs better than the other.  There is a huge difference between many of the brands once you get looking at them.  As far as glass vs aluminum, they are different animals in almost every way including the price tags.  I don't think the OP is in the market for a new Ranger just now but dreaming is always free!"
