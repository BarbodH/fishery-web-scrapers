999396,Tjames09,2017-04-06 11:36:00,664,Anyone plan on going. I don't anticipate much from it. Surprised it's 3 days actually.
999401,captpierre,2017-04-06 12:29:00,2521,Not a bad little show. Went last year. Was free.
999402,oldphart,2017-04-06 12:33:00,665,"~~~Hit the show last year, and will be there again on Saturday. Enjoyed it"
999408,Sinker,2017-04-06 12:55:00,8692,"Its one of the better shows IMO. Some great deals and free entry. I'm going to try and swing by, but I have plans to fish, so it will be tight.   S."
999409,canoecarrier,2017-04-06 12:59:00,54,"Not sure what everyone is talking about, I was there last year. Its very expensive just like most other shows if not more. Not many deals at all, if that's what you are looking for."
999432,fishindevil,2017-04-06 14:55:00,6254,its ok for the area and a great spot to see some fishing buddies and chat....some products there and it was a decent way to spend a few hours....
999447,jimmer,2017-04-06 16:26:00,2730,Handlebars had some good deals on muskie spinner baits.  Some other interesting attractions.  I might stop in after work on Friday.  I think it's rare to find deals at shows.

I think it's rare to find deals at shows. I was thinking the same. I went last year and got a nice set of glasses for $70 when he was asking $100.  I only offered $70 as that's all I had left and I was okay if I didn't get them but he said sure. FYI: This year is $7 per adult.  Last year was free as it was a last minute thing thrown together from the folks that do the TO Sportsman show.  This year should be good too even if it cost's $7 to park and check out the show.
999539,GBW,2017-04-07 11:16:00,8460,If you see a guy with a white and black WFN hat on the odds are its me so say hi
999571,jimmer,2017-04-07 16:13:00,2730,I think I saw that it is free if you have an up to date OFAH membership card with you. Don't quote me on that though.
999615,DRIFTER_016,2017-04-07 20:13:00,10439,Go see Tony and load up on Beaver Lures!!!!

999672,Tjames09,2017-04-08 21:04:00,664,"Well ended buying a bunch of lures, haha. Decent little show."
