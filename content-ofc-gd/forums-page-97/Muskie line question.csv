996964,mistaredone,2017-03-14 19:34:00,913,Just picked up a Diawa Lexa 400 HSL-P for throwing D-10s. I noticed when reaching for 80lb power pro that there are some new types of PP with thinner diameter. When I first started Muskie fishing I had a brief spell with 65lb test till I lost a few lures backlashing on casts. anyone used these lines?  Does the thinner diameter dig in the spool?  Any difference on casting?
996973,esoxansteel,2017-03-14 21:01:00,1307,"Thinner diameter braids will definately dig into the spool, the more braid you spool on the more its likely to happen, go with the regular power pro, or even bump up to 100 pound, if you are catching fish like the one in your avitar"
996975,manitoubass2,2017-03-14 21:07:00,11391,Hi always seem to try new lines then revert back.  I'm no expert but I'd say stick with what works
996984,mike rousseau,2017-03-14 23:46:00,4661,Stick with the 80-100 lb PP
997015,Gregoire,2017-03-15 13:21:00,1397,The line capacity on the Lexa 400 is large enough to spool up with 100#. As long as you have enough capacity on the reel I wouldn't ever do with less then 100#.
997018,Tjames09,2017-03-15 13:58:00,664,The line capacity on the Lexa 400 is large enough to spool up with 100#. As long as you have enough capacity on the reel I wouldn't ever do with less then 100#.  I used 80lb all last year with no issues.  The 400 Daiwa could probably use a decent amount of mono backing before the PP as well. No need to spool the entire thing with PP. Musky arent trout where they run with your line 100 yards.
997022,BlueEye,2017-03-15 14:26:00,338,"Hi Mistaredone - I had the same issue when I first started out with 65lb test, it would break on me with a backlash.  I upgraded to 80-100lb PP and never had an issue since.  I had issues with Sufix 832 breaking on me when I tried them (80lb) as well.  Later this year BloodRun will be releasing a 100lb musky braid that I will be testing for them."

For me casting and trolling big, expensive baits, I'll go with the highest pound test that I can load up with at least 100 yds on my casting lines, longer for trolling. Putting backing on is good, but you can also put a little backing on and reverse your line every year or two as well. Either way you are getting longer life out of the line. I wouldn't want any less then 100yds for casting, it's not the length of the run that will get you, it's the length of the cast."
997109,Rizzo,2017-03-16 02:06:00,4754,"I have tried a couple other things, always come back to the 80lb powerpro"

The 400 holds 200 yards of 80lb braid. thats way to much."
997177,mike rousseau,2017-03-16 22:32:00,4661,I could almost spool my curado 300 casting with 100lb braid on it lol   I always buy 150 yd spools and try to get it all on my reel  If you gotta put backing I use 50lb mono so if by some chance I get to my backing it'll do the job
997196,mistaredone,2017-03-17 02:39:00,913,"I guess at the end of the day, a few less feet in a cast Is worth the less stress of line digging in to the spool.  80lb PP has never failed me or given me any problems and I like my spool filled to the max for better line pick up. I've been using mono backing for years and never got to the backing but 50lb mono is good peace of mind. Trolling lines get shorter every year. I used to troll 150' back and now 10-35' at most. Thanks for all the replies"
997198,mistaredone,2017-03-17 02:42:00,913,I've never came remotely close to spooling my curado. I think I need a casting lesson from you lol
997199,manitoubass2,2017-03-17 03:50:00,11391,A curado only holds like 65 yards of 100lb braid  Are you flipping for musky? Lol
997242,mistaredone,2017-03-17 18:50:00,913,My curado 300ej holds 105 yards of 80lb braid. I'd guess the average cast would be less than 50 yards.
997256,mike rousseau,2017-03-17 22:10:00,4661,"Yeah it doesn't take much 100 lb to fill  Then tie on a 8-10"" glide bait and she goes!!!"
997717,grimsbylander,2017-03-23 12:35:00,3016,What does 500 yards of 80lb or 100lb PP cost?
997754,manitoubass2,2017-03-23 14:36:00,11391,About 70-80 bucks generally  I've found it as low as $50 though
997756,grimsbylander,2017-03-23 14:38:00,3016,Thanks.
1000396,tomkat,2017-04-14 23:29:00,246,I like the suffix. Before that I used tuff line which I also liked. I find the suffix holds less water so your hands stay drier which is nice in colder weather. I used 80 lb with both types.
