The lift is not going to start this year until 10 AM. You register at the dam. Please bring chest waders and a net if you have them, be sure to bring an extra change of clothes just in case you get wet. We lift anywheres from 100 to 220 fish up and over the dam with a net and pulley system. We try to get the kids involved by getting them to net the fish. They then bring the fish over to a holding pen where then samples are taken by a biologist, counted and then lifted to let them carry on their way to the spawning grounds.The event usually takes 3 hours.  Another update will be given on Friday to confirm we are going ahead with the lift."

999657,wantabigone,2017-04-08 15:09:00,97,Hello Ron. I would like to participate with my 12 year old next Saturday. We have some plans later that afternoon and am wondering if our help is required up until noon or is it not really worth it?
999682,MJL,2017-04-09 01:04:00,2427," Hello Ron. I would like to participate with my 12 year old next Saturday. We have some plans later that afternoon and am wondering if our help is required up until noon or is it not really worth it?  It is always worth it. I've been going since 2010 and can definitely say that many hands make light work. Some years, it does take a little longer to hit that 200 fish mark and every little bit of help does count.  Bring a net, a set of waders/boots and perhaps leave a set of spare clothes in the car in the event that your son takes a spill in the drink. There really isn't a time you have to stay till - You can pretty much leave if you need to.

999715,wantabigone,2017-04-09 04:09:00,97,Thanks for the reply MJL. (great pictures!)  As my son does not have hip waders (size 4 feet) will he be able to assist in any way?
