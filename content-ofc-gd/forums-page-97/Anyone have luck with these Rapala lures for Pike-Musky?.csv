999602,wkimwes,2017-04-07 19:18:00,76,"My SAIL in Cambridge had a bunch of the glide baits in the clearance bin, I mean lots on Monday."
999603,manitoubass2,2017-04-07 19:20:00,11391, My lures are no secret lol.
999606,kickingfrog,2017-04-07 19:34:00,8333,To avoid accidents.  My lures are no secret lol.   The secret to not getting hooked by a thrashing fish is dull hooks.
999609,manitoubass2,2017-04-07 19:40:00,11391,Lol. I wish that were true. I don't sharpen hooks at all and I've still got a few piercings
999627,PUMP KNOWS,2017-04-07 21:44:00,937,Thanks Kickinfrog for the pics.  I can't believe those eyes were smashing those big baits.
999629,manitoubass2,2017-04-07 21:55:00,11391,If their hungry they'll smash whatever.  Small pike are you worst for that. Trying to a bait larger than they are lol
999045,PUMP KNOWS,2017-04-04 00:53:00,937,"Anyone here use these lures for pike and musky? If so, how well did they work for you?   Rapala Jointed Clackin Rap 14cm 1-1/2 oz       Rapala Glidin Rap 15cm 2-1/12 oz       Rapala Subwalk 15 15cm 2-1/8 oz   "
999047,Weeds,2017-04-04 01:02:00,782,I've had some success with the Rapala super shad rap. Not one of the choices above but looks pretty similar to the Rapala gliding rap you've got pictured there.
999049,Rizzo,2017-04-04 01:17:00,4754,ditto for the supershadrap...bet I have caught 40-50 muskies on those alone. Haven't used any of the ones you are showing
999053,OhioFisherman,2017-04-04 01:29:00,6623,The first two seem to have been discontinued? Can't find much info at all on #3.
999054,kickingfrog,2017-04-04 01:30:00,8333,"Haven't seen the jointed clackin rap. The sub walk will be tested this year. The gliding rap is great for pike. The gliding rap also caught loads of walleye on a fly-in, but I didn't find a lure that I couldn't catch them on.  The gliding rap is very different from the super shad rap."
999055,Weeds,2017-04-04 01:40:00,782,I imagine the action on the lure would be quite different. I just meant similar more on the basis of length and profile.
999059,captpierre,2017-04-04 01:55:00,2521,Should work great. Muskie are not fussy IMO. Hooks likely a little small
999060,captpierre,2017-04-04 01:57:00,2521,You too. Nicest part near Severn. Rail at Big Chute.
999061,Gallie,2017-04-04 02:01:00,1215,"I ve got a couple pike in the glide rap, im not real big on glide baits in general though so ive caught way more on dbl jointeds, super shad raps, original floating, rapala minnow spoons etc etc lol"
999063,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-04 02:20:00,8243,"If it says Rappala it will catch all manners of Esox species. Number 1 go to lure when in doubt always comes out of a box that says ""Rappala"". I bet those Subwalks will hammer Small Mouth. I really can't tell the difference between an old Shad Raps and the new Glidin Rap. Now I need to spend more money on tackle I just have to have and sure don't need, thanks Pump! I was looking at the new displays at our Canadian Tire store today, man the prices of Rappala's now, under lock and key like jewelry, no wonder. They all start at $12.99."
999067,kickingfrog,2017-04-04 02:38:00,8333,"The super shad rap acts like a floating crank bait. The gilding rap's action is imparted by the angler and its a slow sink/neutrally buoyant lure. The amount of slack and the twitch rate control the lures erratic action.  Thinking about that fly-in, the main reason I settled on the gliding rap was that while trolling it was the lure that put the least amount of stress on my arm/wrist. I was on the tiller and couldn't switch arms."
999068,Tjames09,2017-04-04 02:51:00,664,"I have also caught multiple fish on SSR. The hooks are on the small side, but it does well. I love the action on it. Ive even caught some monster bass on it."
999093,singingdog,2017-04-04 11:19:00,1047,"I have had a couple of very good musky days on the Glidin Rap. It's easier to throw than a lot of the big, heavy glide baits, and won't wear you out working it."
999107,manitoubass2,2017-04-04 15:07:00,11391,"Gliding rap is great, but the clown colour subwalk is worth its weight in gold.  Thats my go to pike lure, absolutely love it! I've caught 5-600 on one lure  Don't be surprised to get some wicked bass on it too especially in the fall"
999128,kickingfrog,2017-04-04 21:22:00,8333,I'd be disappointed if the gliding rap is discontinued.
999130,manitoubass2,2017-04-04 21:43:00,11391,If it is Rob let me know. My local has a huge stock if anyone needs some
999169,Ron,2017-04-05 01:54:00,1683,"The Gliden Rap has been discontinued for more than 3 years now. If you can find them, buy em all. Sail just had a bulk order come in from rapala of discontinued lures to blow out. Oshawa got emptied of the Gliden Raps in the first hour of opening."
999179,kenzy31,2017-04-05 02:24:00,261,"Sub walks are great for pike and bass, good success the last couple seasons on GBay with them. Like the Glide baits, they require lots of slack to work best and get the cadence right. A length of stiff mono works well, I use 8-12"" of 20lbBig Game for bass and 40lb flouro for pike. Same setup with super spooks too, zero line tangles with trebles. Slack line in braid will foul all the time, real PITA!"
999230,JoshS,2017-04-05 14:06:00,729,Glidin raps have a time and place. my fav colour is bluegill. That jointed clackin rap looks like it would be good too fished slow with shakes of the rod to twitch it back erratically. Guess I'm gonna buy one now ! There's a lot of jointed hard swimbaits out there.
999271,PUMP KNOWS,2017-04-05 16:44:00,937,"If anyone picked up an extra Glidin Rap in Firetiger (BPC) and wanna trade for other colours, let me know.  I need to get my hands on some of the Super Shads if I can find them on sale."
999554,kickingfrog,2017-04-07 14:23:00,8333,"The Gliden Rap has been discontinued for more than 3 years now. If you can find them, buy em all. Sail just had a bulk order come in from rapala of discontinued lures to blow out. Oshawa got emptied of the Gliden Raps in the first hour of opening.   Well that stinks, but I guess if it's been that long I'll somehow manage.  Now I might be hesitant to use the ones I have for fear of loosing them."
999591,kickingfrog,2017-04-07 18:19:00,8333,The smaller gliding rap (top left) was the one I mentioned earlier. After having so much success with it I picked up the larger size.    Even the smallmouth like the big gliding rap.  
999594,kickingfrog,2017-04-07 18:33:00,8333,"Found some photos from that fly-in trip:  Gliding rap    Like I said, I tried everything to see what the eyes wouldn't eat up there.     Saltwater x-rap:      Third cast and second fish of the trip.  Topwater walleye: "
999596,manitoubass2,2017-04-07 18:59:00,11391,"Nice Rob!!!! Great pics!  You're brave. I ditched the ""lure in mouth photo"" years ago"
