999500,misfish,2017-04-06 22:55:00,29133,Squirrel is some good eats. One of my fav.
999502,manitoubass2,2017-04-06 23:05:00,11391,"Oh im positive it's how it was cooked. I love wild game, to me it's easily my favorite food group. I've had beaver that was great, beaver that sucked too, and it's somewhat similar, tough oily meat.  Seems odd they'd ban snappers, there is billions of the things. And it's not like it's anyone's daily meal. Everyone I know that harvests them eats maybe 2 a year.  Anyone caught one fishing? I caught a monster on Mainville years ago, musta been 90lbs, thing was huge. Glad I have long pliers, I was scared crappless to take the hook out lol. It fought good, like hauling up half a tree hahahah(I actually thought I snagged a large branch)"
999507,wkrp,2017-04-06 23:36:00,656,The last time I had anything to do with a snapper I almost lost a finger !
999508,manitoubass2,2017-04-06 23:46:00,11391,Hahaha they have one gnarly bite! I had one take a metal stringer off the tinnie.  Lost 4 lil eater walleyes

999516,wallacio,2017-04-07 00:58:00,475," I've ate it a few times (one time fried, in soup other 2 times) and it was great every time. That said, harvest methods and preparation make a huge difference with the final outcome of pretty much any animal we'd consider eating. Just look at how many people claim moose or deer is disgusting, when in fact it is delicious. How about fish that wasn't handled properly and tastes/smells fishy? You just ate some turtle that was prepared by someone who didn't have a clue what they were doing, that's all.  Seems to me like their harvest has been stopped due to emotional reasons and people who don't have a clue, much like the spring bear hunt was.   As for being endangered in Ontario, nope.  https://www.ontario.ca/page/snapping-turtle  Status Special Concern “Special Concern” means the species lives in the wild in Ontario, is not endangered or threatened, but may become threatened or endangered due to a combination of biological characteristics and identified threats.  The MNRF likely received quite a few uninformed, emotionally-based comments during the public consultation period but there were scientifically sound reasons to end the harvest.  Snapping turtles take upwards of 20 years to reach sexual maturity and when they do, they have very low reproductive success.   It's been estimated that fewer than 1 in 1800 eggs ever produce a mature individual.    Combine this with the significant mortality that they face in most areas of their range from road collisions, the loss of any mature individuals and be catastrophic to the local population.    Most if not all conservation groups have been pushing for years to suspend the hunt.

999527,Dara,2017-04-07 02:17:00,3052," I,m glad they acted quickly and responsibly. After years of study, consultation and consideration they cancel with a day's notice. No need to wait for new regs to come out. And those endangered bunnies will be safe now as well.  Kudos to the mnrf and the whole government for this monumentous decision"
999528,manitoubass2,2017-04-07 02:25:00,11391,"If the rabbit thing is true, lol good luck"
999549,Cast-Away,2017-04-07 12:43:00,790,If this wasn't a family site I would have some great comments to this Manitoubass! I can say that I have saved a number of trees in my life!
999551,manitoubass2,2017-04-07 13:09:00,11391,"This one was mild, look at the last page lol"

999592,aplumma,2017-04-07 18:23:00,6896,ummmmm while funny.................  Redirect and send the others by P.M.  Thanks   Art
998992,Jon,2017-04-03 17:13:00,209,Looks like MNRF has ended the harvest of snapping turtles across the province. Also some changes to small game hunting.  https://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTMxMDUy&statusId=MjAwNjQw&language=en  https://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTMxMDUx&statusId=MjAwNjM4&language=en   Jon
999103,fishindevil,2017-04-04 14:20:00,6254,that's awewsome news and its about time too....long overdue for sure......
999104,manitoubass2,2017-04-04 14:33:00,11391,"Harvesting snappers is rediculous anyhow.  The meat doesn't get better with age, trust that"
999106,manitoubass2,2017-04-04 14:42:00,11391,"True story, around here, indiginous from on harvesting any turtle, but especially snapping turtles.  To them, we live on turtle island. Which is the Americas. No idea how they've known this for thousands of years, but look on the map and you'll know why they call it turtle island.  I once found a dead snapper on the beach in Porter's inlet on rainy lake. I was gonna keep it, was beautiful! I grabbed the huge hollowed out she'll only to get stung about 50 hornets that had taken up residence lol.  The place I post alot of shore fishing pics from, is on the ""turtle of Manitou"". I've shown it too Brian aka Wormdunker. I needed special permission from elders to fish or even go there. And every spring we bring berries and gifts to the turtle for protection and thanks. We also fill a water pail and float it down the river. Im not sure why though??? I should probably ask"
999108,Cast-Away,2017-04-04 15:43:00,790,"Darn does this mean I can't order turtle soup in the restaurant any more and tell the waiter to ""make it snappy""?"
999109,manitoubass2,2017-04-04 15:51:00,11391,For anyone interested in a read  http://www.native-drums.ca/index.php/Stories/The_Creation?tp=a
999301,AKRISONER,2017-04-05 19:21:00,5558,i signed a petition a while back to try stop their harvest...it seemed bloody ridiculous that they were still allowing a threatened species to be harvested anyways.  Glad to see some action in effect.
999311,aplumma,2017-04-05 20:30:00,6896,If they are endangered then they need protection. Down here they are not and they make a delicious soup. There are lots of different animals that some look at as food and other don't. If you harvest from the land and use it then I feel it is the correct way to use resources. If you are just killing them then I feel it is a crime against nature.   Art
999315,manitoubass2,2017-04-05 20:43:00,11391," If you like it im assuming it's just cooking technique, but holy man I'd rather eat raw beaver, if it's cleaned properly it doesn't taste like fish ????"
999327,aplumma,2017-04-05 21:36:00,6896,All in the cooking it needs to be cleaned with only muscle meat and then slow stewed in a red gravy. Served on a bed of rice mmmm mmmm good.   Art

999354,Joeytier,2017-04-06 00:25:00,3990,"Snappers are nowhere near being a threatened species...  I see hundreds of them a year without even looking, and I've never met a single person in my life that ever actually harvests them.  Doesn't seem so ridiculous to me.  I'd be happy to try it actually."
999356,manitoubass2,2017-04-06 00:42:00,11391,In NW Ontario there are millions. It's rediculous really.  But im not losing sleep on a ban.  Harvesting them here is still super rare
999398,pics,2017-04-06 11:45:00,1268,I don't think you would like to know just how many contaminants are in a snapping turtle. The government tested some in a lake close to me with alarming results...
999405,AKRISONER,2017-04-06 12:40:00,5558,sorry. not threatened...species of special concern as populations are on decline.  and go ahead try slap me...a hunter with an anti hunting label lol.
999406,dave524,2017-04-06 12:44:00,4508,I don't think you would like to know just how many contaminants are in a snapping turtle.

Are you talking about Lake Niapenco ?? that is a one of deal with that fire fighting foam from the Hamilton Airport training. It and the Welland River are the only spots where that is a factor.
999421,manitoubass2,2017-04-06 13:40:00,11391,I'd imagine you are correct.  300 year old meat probably picks up a lil of this and a lil of that along the way
999426,Dara,2017-04-06 14:24:00,3052,I got a notice from OFAH last Friday saying the MNRF is closing rabbit season on April 1  I actually thought it was an April fools joke instead of another Kathleen move
999438,BillM,2017-04-06 15:41:00,17367,"I'd rather eat 50 year old lake trout, lol."
999442,Dara,2017-04-06 16:03:00,3052,"Some people don't like moose, some bear, some even rabbits. But for the government to just randomly prohibit hunting like they did with spring bear a few years back is just wrong. The government works for the people. To just impose anything without an explanation is wrong."
999445,manitoubass2,2017-04-06 16:18:00,11391,Agreed
999486,wkrp,2017-04-06 21:28:00,656,Personally I would rather chew leather than one of those bacteria  riddled creatures.
999487,manitoubass2,2017-04-06 21:29:00,11391,"Leather is more tender, that's for sure lol"
999491,ch312,2017-04-06 21:36:00,1590,"Man I wanted to like it so bad lol. I've ate some crazy foods and snapping turtle just isn't good.

999499,aplumma,2017-04-06 22:46:00,6896,"Turtle meat is a treat that you either like or not. The amount of work to clean and the cooking time makes it easy to take a pass on. I bet we could get the same reaction to people who eat squirrel  and rabbit because it is a food we have to work for. I bet that chicken would not be eaten nearly as much if it needed to be killed, cleaned and cooked at  your house.  Art"
