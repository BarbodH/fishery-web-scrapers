999736,4x4bassin,2017-04-09 14:34:00,1025,^^^ The video is correct but eventually that factory or original DWR wears out and you have to treat it with the spray or wash in . But like I said unless you are rolling around in the mud with your suit on I wouldn't wash it . Once it is washed a couple times that original DWR is gone and the treatments won't bring it back to original . Now the treatments do work for a little while but don't last as long as the original DWR .
999766,Musky Plug,2017-04-09 19:40:00,398,Went to Bps today and decided to buy the tourney special rain suit instead of the 100mph. Not as high quality as the 100mph stuff but it was much cheaper. The jacket and bib came out to just under 300 and with the gc's made it a little cheaper. Looking forward to trying them out in a couple weeks. I appreciate all the feedback from everyone.

999472,Tjames09,2017-04-06 20:09:00,664,I would say no. There very windproof so they don't breathe to much. I find them really warm for fall and winter fishing.
999482,ch312,2017-04-06 21:22:00,1590,"For a cheaper alternative, consider something from Frogg Togg's. I purchased their Road Toad jacket and pants that are designed to fit over your clothing while riding a motorcycle and they've been great for the 3 years I have been using them, plus they still look new. They're 100% waterproof and breathable, even when ripping at 120 kph in the rain. I think it was $80 total for the jacket and pants.  Super light, paper thin, and they pack down very small for storage."

999553,Sinker,2017-04-07 14:09:00,8692,"How long have you guys/gals had the guidewear/100MPH suits?  I find rain gear has a short lifespan. I've tried all kinds, and after 2-3 years, I get wet.  It sucks spending big money on stuff that doesn't last.  I've started buying cheap stuff again. Some of it lasts longer. Same with waders. I've had the top of line waders,and after 2-3 seasons they leak, so now I spend $100 on cheapies, and replace them every couple years.  S."
999556,manitoubass2,2017-04-07 14:38:00,11391,  Jacket and pants cost $150 I believe(I'll look). And I should mention it's spring/fall gear not winter gear  But my dad is a distributor and gets some wicked sales so if anyone is interested let me know. Some stuff I get for 50% off all the way up to free.  But sizing is an issue with stormtech. I'd always go a size up
999575,Musky Plug,2017-04-07 16:27:00,398,I'm interested lol. Is the gear wind proof as well as waterproof? What would be a comparable set to the Bps 100mph stuff? I'm looking for a set for myself and the girlfriend.

999658,4x4bassin,2017-04-08 15:40:00,1025,"One thing that has not been mentioned here and maybe a lot of people don't even know is that Gore-Tex  comes in different grades . Most of the middle of the line suits are made with the regular Gore-Tex product and it's a great product that is very suitable for everyones needs . Then there is the top of line that is called Pro Gore-Tex that come in top of the line stuff but is very pricey . The Simms suit is made with the Pro Gore Tex that's why it's almost twice as much but it's a far superior rain suit and you will pay for that upgrade . I also believe there is a lesser grade then the above two that is cheaper to buy but obviously not as good . You will see these different grades reflected in the price for sure . Keep this in mind when you are looking . .  As for the longevity of Gore-Tex the above posters are bang on in that you have to clean the product with appropriate cleaners when it gets dirty . Once it gets dirty/old and the water doesn't bead off it anymore the fabric will ""wet through"" and you will get damp/wet .Be fore warned and this is from my experience don't wash/treat your suit until its necessary . The original water repellent (DWR) on the suit is the best its going to get and once it's washed with the cleaners its gone for good and all the treatments won't bring it back to original ."
999674,Musky Plug,2017-04-08 21:52:00,398, I was unaware there was different grades of gortex. I watched a video on YouTube saying that if your gear starts leaking water you can wash it then put it in the dryer and it reactivates the dwr. Or must if be treated with the dwr spray or wash in stuff first then dried in the dryer?
999159,Musky Plug,2017-04-05 00:47:00,398,"Hey all,  So I've been looking at purchasing new rain gear for this year. Was thinking about either Bps 100mph rain suit or the Cabela's guide series rain gear. The prices for these are around $600 for the complete suit but I'm willing to pay the extra money if it keeps my dry and will last. I don't want to have to keep spending money on new rain gear. Does anyone have any experience with either of these brands of rain gear or any other brands that are any good?"
999174,Dutch01,2017-04-05 02:15:00,1431,"I have the Bass Pro Shops ""Pro Qualifier"" bib pant (coat coming soon). It's really great quality, I can't imagine going without it now. Not cheap, but damn good."
999183,GBW,2017-04-05 02:35:00,8460,"M-P, there has been a few older (not too old) posts about this if you hit the search for ""rain gear"" and if memory is correct Simm's, Cabela's then BPS come to mind."
999195,Tomcat,2017-04-05 04:14:00,395,"There are some good prices if you can wait for a sale. Last Jun, I purchased one Cabela's Guidewear Extreme Parka and one Cabela's Guidewear Extreme Bib on sale for $489.98 not including the HST. The sale price for each unit was $244.99. I just checked the Cabela's Canada site and they have the same units on sale for $299.99 in lieu of $349.99. I bought my first set of Cabela's Guidewear in 2004 and was very happy with the product."
999208,Fishwilly,2017-04-05 11:16:00,206,You can get a Frabill F2 suit for $48/piece at Amazon.com.
999209,Big Cliff,2017-04-05 11:38:00,6899,That's more in my budget for something I hope I won't need too often
999212,RickOnt,2017-04-05 12:07:00,669,"I have the BPS Pro Qualifier and it has been flawless.  If you are out in a rain and want to fish it is worth every penny!!   My buddy did the cheaper stuff, Wetskins, FrogToggs  etc  Last year he bought the Cabelas Guidewear and was extremely happy with the purchase He was sure wishing he had done it sooner"
999216,Lape0019,2017-04-05 12:28:00,647,100mph here as well. Love it. It works great.  My only complain is the Velcro on my wrist strap came unglued. I can fix that though.
999219,manitoubass2,2017-04-05 12:48:00,11391,"My pops sells stormtech gear through his store, so warning lol.  The stuff they sell offline is unreal.  Im talking warmer weather gear though, no idea as to the colder weather gear.  I use mine at work even because it fits well, it's durable, fully water proof etc.  Stormtech is often thought of as ""cheaper"". But man they make some wicked gear if you look"
999222,Garnet,2017-04-05 13:01:00,2056,"I own both Cabelas Guide Wear and BPS 100mph.  Guide Wear is terrible. Has water proof zippers on all pockets. The main zipper large chunky drain hole the second zipper large chunky drain hole with little pieces of Velcro. The hands are Velcro. The hood parachutes bad.  The 100 mph all zippers are water proof. The hands are neoprene, the hood has a large flap that goes across your face and string's to tighten down.  The 100 mph is about 200% better than Guide Wear."
999229,JoshS,2017-04-05 14:05:00,729,"Last season I lost my cabela's jacket.. flew out of the boat somewhere on the french. Then end of season I lost a bag with my bibs and backup jacket lol. I had the cabela's tourney trail suit.. I liked it. It kept me 95% dry for 4 seasons of good use. However if standing in hard downpour for most of a day, there'd be a bit a moisture in side the jacket. Pretty good overall though. This was the old model, the new model doesn't fit as nice on me so I passed. It was on sale last time I was at cabela's FYI around a month ago.  I just got a suit at coscto made by wetskins that will get me by for now. Nylon waterproof treatment so I'm not expecting top performance but fits nice and not expensive.. undoubtedly it won't last, but will be nice to have in the boat for warm months and backup until I get something heavier for fall.  Can't go wrong with cabela's or bps jackets at the higher end level. Both get good reviews."
999233,Musky Plug,2017-04-05 14:22:00,398,"I will do that. Leaning more towards bps and cabelas, Simms is a little out of the budget unfortunately lol.   Well I was thinking about getting one for may for walleye opener. I did the sale on the cabelas site, and almost purchased it. But I figured I would ask for people's opinions that have been there done that. I would be disappointed if I spent the money and wasn't happy with the product.  I will have to look this brand, thanks."
999234,Musky Plug,2017-04-05 14:23:00,398,"I was also looking at the F3 suit, has anyone had any experience with these suits?"

999240,4x4bassin,2017-04-05 14:57:00,1025,"^^^ That's funny JoshS , well not really . That happened to me last year as well . Coat flew out of boat and I didn't realize till the end of the day . Big kick in the ass there !!! Anyways , the one I lost was Guide Wear and it was a very good coat . Replaced it with another one and it has been flawless . I had an older Guide Wear coat that was pretty good as well but these newer ones are a lot better in my view . One thing I look for is how much Velcro is on the product , hate the stuff so less is best in my eyes . I do a lot of backwoods trekking/fishing and found that the Velcro on my old coat would pick up every pine needle and such making it look like crap but also deeming the Velcro almost useless . The new coat has very little Velcro compared to the older models . Also Cabelas has a great warranty program with there products . I know the Guide Wear goes on sale every so often compared to the BPS 100mph which hardly ever goes on sale .  Either way they are both great products and you won't lose with either .  One more thing , don't hesitate in spending the money on a good rain suit . Bar none , one of the best investments I have made . Nothing worse then being on a camping trip and getting soaked to the bone in cheap raingear . Been there , froze and not doing it again"

And yes it sucks being cold and frozen happened to me last year and hoping not again this year lol.   Yes I have been told by more than a couple people that they're the best, sadly though it's out of my budget."
999268,kickingfrog,2017-04-05 16:34:00,8333,The stuff does go on sale sometimes and you can save a few hundred dollars when is does. Some work stores sell heavy duty rain gear. Some might not be as breathable but when its cold and your sittin' and fishin' it does the job and can be much cheaper.
