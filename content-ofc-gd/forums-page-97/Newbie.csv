This is my first real try at fishing in the park.  I will be camping along the HWY 60 corridor (MEW Lake) and was looking for some advice as to fishing at this time of year.  I was thinking of trying Bruce Lake/Provoking Lake and maybe even Brewer Lake.  Anyone ever fished them and any tips on how to catch 'em.  Thanks,  RAO"

1000052,aplumma,2017-04-11 22:46:00,6896,Welcome to the site I as well can not offer advise on the area though.   art
1000069,adempsey,2017-04-12 00:32:00,1498,"Don't know those lakes, but if they have splake or brookies, a slip bobber and worm near some brush works great."

1000080,Chuck Enwinde,2017-04-12 02:53:00,247,I've fished them all with limited success.  Seems like you're looking for splake specifically?  Will you have a canoe that you're able to portage?
1000088,RAO,2017-04-12 10:23:00,13,Hey everyone thanks for the greetings.  Chuck yes I have a canoe.  If portaging it would have to be a short trip as we are staying along the Hwy 60 corridor.
1000215,Chuck Enwinde,2017-04-13 04:31:00,247,I can heartily recommend not portaging to Provoking Lake.  You almost need climbing gear for that one.  Plus I'm not a fan of splake lakes that have bass as a general rule.  I'll shoot you a pm but you'll want to temper your expectations a bit as the fishing along the corridor is generally not great.

Can't help with that specific area of the park, it's been years and when we went it was to go after Smallies and enjoy the park and it's sheer beauty. Camping to me now is a budget motel. Even if you don't get a fish it's worth the trip, everyone should go there at least once. Good luck."
