999618,floater,2017-04-07 20:22:00,220,I've been reading up for the coming Lake Nipigon trip and I see that you can only use a single barbless hook. Is that just for brook trout or the whole lake? Can I have my body baits in the boat and just not use them?
999620,AKRISONER,2017-04-07 20:34:00,5558,you can definitely have the gear on you and not be using it...otherwise bringing pretty much any tackle bag to any national park or any specific lake with lure regs would be in violation. Its almost impossible to enforce that.  Definitely wouldnt want a rod with anything illegal tied on though in the boat.
999626,spincast,2017-04-07 21:44:00,3279,"whole lake. Makes for a lot of hook work before, and after"
999632,jjcanoe,2017-04-07 22:21:00,744,"A treble hook is considered a single hook, mash the barbs down and you're good to go. A good pair of split ring pliers is a must for removing extra hooks on crank baits etc. Make sure you remember what hook goes with which lure when you put them back on!"
999633,jjcanoe,2017-04-07 22:24:00,744,The single barbless rule for Lake Nipigon applies to any lure that is in the water no matter what species you are fishing for.
999637,floater,2017-04-07 22:48:00,220,Ok thanks for the replies. I'm going to thin out the tackle and only bring what I figure I will need instead of the whole lot. I'm guessing spinner baits and jigs will take up most of the room.
999640,Raf,2017-04-07 23:14:00,3495,Don't set aside the body baits.  Replace rear treble with a single siwash and remove the front.  Doing so really wakes these baits up and troots seem to usually eat from behind.
999648,floater,2017-04-08 10:33:00,220,Good idea thanks
999749,BillM,2017-04-09 16:04:00,17367,"I never remove my trebles and replace with siwash, especially for brook trout.  I usually remove the stock hooks and add Owners (a bit bigger then the original).   Pinch the barbs down and you're golden.   You definitely want to bring body baits up there."
999773,kickingfrog,2017-04-09 20:18:00,8333,"At the risk of opening a can of worms. If you were limited to a single hook. Where would you have it?  For most situations and lures I'd remove the back hook and leave the front hook, or one of the forward hooks if the where 3. My theory is that if the fish are only nipping at the bait and catching the rear hook only then maybe I need to reconsider lure speed and/or lure type. Obviously the balance of the lure is critical and some would work better than others."
999775,BillM,2017-04-09 20:51:00,17367,I'd remove the back hook but I don't fish body baits much up there for brookies.  Flys/spoons.
999786,manitoubass2,2017-04-09 22:05:00,11391,"Keep the front hook for sure!  The fish usually aren't chasing the lure, their ambushing it from the side  Different Abit if your bouncing bottom though, sometimes"
999832,floater,2017-04-10 12:46:00,220,Never even thought of which hook to keep on a double hooked body bait! I will try some with back hook and some with front and see what happens.
999950,Freshtrax,2017-04-11 02:18:00,2215,Leave the body baits at home and stock up on egb spoons and inline spinners. You need to me able to cast a mile some days with water clarity the way it is up there.
