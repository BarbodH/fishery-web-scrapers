999303,Big Cliff,2017-04-05 19:27:00,6899,"So please give me some insite; I have never been to one of these ""tackle swaps"" (I know, stupid right)!

What can I contribute? what is the objective?  I know, I know, old man still learning LOL."

I haven't been to this particular one before; but tackle swaps originated as a slightly larger versions of what you described.  There is a lot of second hand tackle for sale by individuals.  Some of the swaps also have some stores participating as well.  If you have more tackle than you need (don't we all); and you want to get rid of some you could set up a table and sell some of your stuff... and use the cash to buy more stuff from other people there  Since your dealing with individuals, not tackle stores, expect to pay cash."
999316,misfish,2017-04-05 20:47:00,29133,"I as well have not been to this one, but the Hamilton one has always been great. Think the last time Terry and I went, we spent like $100 for all we got, and that probly worked out to retail at about $350."

999394,Chuck Enwinde,2017-04-06 11:13:00,247,I'll be there if I'm not fishing.  Lots of good deals to be had.
999431,SmokestackLightnin,2017-04-06 14:45:00,390,"My son and I have been to North Toronto swap all of the three previous years.  Sad to say we may not make it this year.  Anyway, lots of everything there and good deals to boot.  Get there as early as you can."
999449,moxie,2017-04-06 16:39:00,1566,"My first one was in Bowmanville this year. Found a few items in the actual swap section and really enjoyed the different offerings, some even local, on the retail side. A good way to break the pre-season monotony and kill a few hours. Season has already started for me so this Sunday is reserved for hunting Crappie. Good luck with it."
999788,PUMP KNOWS,2017-04-09 22:59:00,937,I got there at 12:30 and there was only 1 table left.  Everyone else was long gone or packing.  I thought it was from 9am- 2pm.
999789,John Bacon,2017-04-09 23:11:00,3277,"I think you want to be there early for tackle swaps.  It was not as bigs the Bowmanville swap, but there was quite a bit of stuff there at 9:00 AM."
999791,PUMP KNOWS,2017-04-09 23:38:00,937,"I see, it was my first time attending a tackle swap"

I used to go to a number of them here, that was pretty much the same way they worked here. Most seemed to be held in a VFW or community center hall before the fishing season got into full swing. One mans trash is another mans treasure?  The selection of items could vary widely, hit or miss from year to year."
