998407,GBW,2017-03-29 17:43:00,8460,Boy lots has changed since I joined back in 2000. Yeah it used to be OF(N) before we went the way of communities. Funny thing is that we were a much closer community then than we are today. sad but true.
998409,Headhunter,2017-03-29 18:10:00,5703,"Boy lots has changed since I joined back in 2000. Yeah it used to be OF(N) before we went the way of communities. Funny thing is that we were a much closer community then than we are today. Agreed! Historically, we had many gtg's back in the old days, some for wings, some to fish, but all of them face to face meetings where we would swap manly stories. I met one of my best buds at a gtg held by Fishheadrick at Ashbridges Bay. Rick BBQed some chicken, we tossed lures for trout and salmon and met some pretty cool folks. As the number of members grew over time, the old guard will have kept in touch, but the number and frequency of gtg's decreased. To some degree, that's why some of the more recent members have felt like they are on the outside, lookin in. My advice, set up a gtg! Invite everyone and who knows, you may end up meeting some cool people and make some long term friends. Many of us have been through the good times and bad times together, this place has helped us all. HH"
998452,Loonietoon,2017-03-30 01:48:00,1450,Have setup GTGs in Hamilton a few times... lots of notice but only us old original guys show... we will continue to do this from time to time

998128,verno,2017-03-27 02:03:00,178,It was actually from the of(n) days but it seems the software changes that to OFC now.  It was a really old sticker.  From back when Bass Pro first opened and everyone would joke about walking around the fishing show or Bass Pro asking everyone if they were an OF(N)'r.  I see that logo is used on another site that uses network instead of Community and doesn't have a forum.
