Then heard the charge of impaired. WHY??????????? Im am still so pissed at this guy.  This was a senseless death, of a young child.  http://barrie.ctvnews.ca/eight-year-old-boy-dies-after-canoe-capsizes-near-bracebridge-1.3360527  Police say an eight-year-old Huntsville boy has died and a man is facing charges after a canoe capsized in the Muskoka River on Friday. Ontario Provincial Police say the canoe overturned near High Falls in Bracebridge, Ont., and both people in the canoe -- the man and the boy -- were thrown into the river. When officers got to the scene, the man, who is a family friend, said he didn't know where the boy was. OPP say that although the boy was wearing a life-jacket, he had gone over the waterfall. Emergency crews tried CPR, and took the boy to the hospital, but he later died of his injuries. Investigators say 37-year-old Toronto man has been charged with impaired operation of a vessel causing death, and care and control over 80 milligrams. He's scheduled to appear in a Bracebridge court on May 9."

Sad indeed.   I could only think of this being me with one of my grandchildren. Never happen. As much as my one granddaughter ( the fisher girl ) kept bugging the crap out of me to go ice fishing this pass season, I said no.  Not that I would be drinking, as the ice conditions were not safe IMO to take a young one out on."

999740,hunteronwheels,2017-04-09 15:15:00,112,"i think this would be a good time to remind people What are the penalties for impaired boating? Boaters caught drinking and boating in Ontario face consequences similar to those for drinking and driving: These sanctions apply to anyone who is caught drinking and operating motorized and non-motorized vessels, including power boats, canoes, kayaks, personal watercraft, sailboats, rafts, dinghies and other inflatable boats."
999743,wkrp,2017-04-09 15:44:00,656,Since I have owned a boat of my own I have taken the position of Captain very seriously. No Alchohol  or person under the influence is allowed in my boat. My sincerest condolences to all family members .
999826,DanD,2017-04-10 11:22:00,2223,"Where were this child's parents? When my kids were of that age and older; there was no way in hell that I would allow anyone to take my kids out on a river, above a water fall. Especially on an all but freezing, likely fast moving spring run off river. I'm not defending this guy who took the kid out; he was wrong and yes he was legally impaired. That means he could have had 2 beers in him; are you physically impaired or legally after 2 beers? Regardless it is very sad that a child has died; it could and should have been prevented. Again where were the parents; the people who are the ultimate care givers for the child?  Dan."

You're taking a young child out in early spring in a canoe, maybe a good time to stay away from the booze. Same with ice fishing with young kids - fun, but again, a good time to stay away from the booze. Can't imagine taking my kids, let alone someone else's kids, out in a canoe in cold water after drinking. Guy also apparently said he didn't know where the child was, which I still can't get my head around."
999841,BillM,2017-04-10 13:03:00,17367,"I wouldn't be out on the water in a canoe at that time a year, whatever thought process went into this decision was a bad one.   I can't imagine how the parents thought that was a good idea.  Life jackets don't save you from hypothermia."
999964,SirCranksalot,2017-04-11 13:21:00,3291,"Makes me shudder!!! Canoe,cold water, river, a kid--that makes it too dangerous already! Add booze and it's criminally negligent.  Since I have owned a boat of my own I have taken the position of Captain very seriously. No Alchohol or person under the influence is allowed in my boat. My sincerest condolences to all family members .  Good call! I just have a canoe but my rule is the same!"
