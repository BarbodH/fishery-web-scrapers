We actually used sterilized blades just in case. Back then $30 a box by Swan- Morton!  I still have a few of them but their use is limited now, How would you clean fish with it?  I show them to kids today and explain how it was used and they think I fell out of a tree!"
999638,ketchenany,2017-04-07 22:53:00,3229,"Just to add. The blade was snap-in very secure. Don't want to leave it in someone! BUT you held the blade and pushed the handle inserting. taking it out was more of a skill, unless you knew to ""lift the blade and pull"" this is where blood was lost lol. In 20 years I never saw my own blood!!!!"

999344,mike rousseau,2017-04-05 23:30:00,4661, Good evening  I've been looking around for a knife for the sole purpose of cleaning perch  I don't mean a fillet knife...  Anyone that cleans them the way I do ...  removes the dorsal... slit belly... remove head... skin.. fillet... you know what I mean  The old boys used to grind down their blades in a machine shop to the point that they looked like a jailhouse shank  The closest thing I can find is a wood carving bench knife pictured below but imagine that blade on a regular size pocket knife handle  Anyone have any suggestion on a small blade knife?  Thanks

999348,mike rousseau,2017-04-05 23:46:00,4661,Pretty much yeah  But looking for something with a handle that will be comfortable cleaning a pail of perch  The one I posted is the best looking handle I have found in my search

999489,Mister G,2017-04-06 21:34:00,1429,"Any 4"" SHARP fillet knife works great on perch and then have your cleaning partner skin them with a 6"" sharp fillet blade.  The smaller 4"" blade keeps the working end of that knife closer to your wrist and that is where all the control comes from, plus it's move the process along a much better pace.  I have literally cleaned thousands of perch this way . . . ."

Yep, I buy them from a cutlery shop for a buck apiece. Shortest blade I ever got was around 5"", most are 6"" or more so they would still need to be ground down further. Plus they have a full size handle which might not be the best for what Mike wants.  Cheers"
