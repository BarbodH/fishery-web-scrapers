999493,landry,2017-04-06 21:39:00,1005,Was hoping to hit the Detroit for walleye. It's mud. Anyone been to Dunnville for cats yet? Has it started yet? And what do u think this rain will do to the river in that area??? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks Landry

Current river temps at York (upstream of Caledonia) are still below 10 degrees. The Dunnville levels are just below low level floods - in 1 - 2 days when it'll peak.  They are currently using dams to minimise flooding, so expect some release of the excess water after that to keep the river higher for an extended period compared to the actual rainfall days. The GRCA site has a bunch of info on water temps, flows and conditions if you're into watching the riva flow."
