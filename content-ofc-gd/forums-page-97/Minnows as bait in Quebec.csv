Edit: Correction, it appears I'm totally wrong, however I'm trying to find out the regulations for minnows in zone 22 south. Can't find any info!"
999123,Joeytier,2017-04-04 20:33:00,3990,"As of this year, you cannot use dead bait fish during open water season.  Zero exceptions."

However the MFFP website is offered in English. Confusing as hell though - the zone I'm traveling to (22) is divided into North and South, and then subdivided again in an absolute mess of subzones. See for yourself; https://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/online/wildlife/fishing-regulations/pdf/impression/Fishing-Map-Zone-22.pdf  I could see people getting in trouble over these new regs. If you seldom travel to quebec, and check these bait regulations real quick, it would be easy to assume live baitfish are allowed in certain zones. Zone 22 for example isn't even mentioned. So you could readily assume there are no prohibitions on baitfish at all."
999276,Joeytier,2017-04-05 17:15:00,3990,"But it has never been legal to bring in live bait from another province, so the first time you go to ask someone in a tackle shop you will be told what the rules are."

999455,Oggie,2017-04-06 17:55:00,588,I fish the Ottawa River and if you're on the Quebec side of the river minnows are illegal.  But you can have a beer visible when checked by Quebec enforcement!  Hope the minnows got the memo  so they don't SWIM across the river!  It doesn't make sense on this body of water.
999837,fish_fishburn,2017-04-10 12:56:00,1311,If the minnows speak French you can use them for bait. Quebec is such a waste of money to the rest of the country. I wish they would of separated when they wanted too.
999853,Whitespinnerbait,2017-04-10 13:59:00,2038,Fish_Fishburn  has it right....Only French speaking minnows can be used.
