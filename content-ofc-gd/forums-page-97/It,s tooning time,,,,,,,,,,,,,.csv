Calm waters, sunrise and yup, I was just happy to be out rowing away and fishing. Our plan was to hit our late ice out perch spot. I guess the perch figured to move out as well, as not a single mark. LOL  No matter, out floating and trying. Me bye seemed to be having bladder issues, ( I felt his pain, as I have been there, not fun ) Not fun dealing with a leaky bladder, especially at his age, so we decided to head in and get it checked out. Gave him my spare valve. Thats what buds do. He decided to see if it was going to hold, so with still lots of time to fish, I went on my way to find another spot to fish. Went from open water, to a skim of ice at my next location. No worries. The ice breaking toon was ready. 1/4"" skim across the bay and into the marina. Got my way out and well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  "

999784,misfish,2017-04-09 21:31:00,29133,"Told ya. You got cracks just like I did. New bladder is the only cure.  Ya your new NASA thingamajig is nice, but I,ll stay with what works. LOL  Yes big perch. Needed my new scale."

999798,Terry,2017-04-10 00:48:00,14456,and on back lakes it makes its own depth maps
999801,John Bacon,2017-04-10 00:51:00,3277,and on back lakes it makes its own depth maps  I guess it would take quite a while to get the whole lake mapped.  It will probably be pretty detailed when it was done though.
999802,Acountdeleted,2017-04-10 00:55:00,2562,Looked like an awesome day. And a nice snack to boot.
