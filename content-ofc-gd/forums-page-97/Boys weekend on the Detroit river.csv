We opted to book a charter on the Detroit river for spring walleye with Kyle Moxon. It proved to be a good choice.       The weather screwed us. The 2 days of heavy rain really messed up the river. On Saturday no one on the river caught walleye. Kyle knew it was going to be bad so he already had a plan ""B""  We would start hunting for canals that had warmer and clearer water and chase panfish. Plan ""B"" was a blast. Not many canals were productive as the water was too cold in most, but we found a couple that had water temps in the mid 40's and that's where the action was.We started pitching to dock posts and walls with bucktail and marabou jigs and the fish started flying. Four solid hours of float fishing with a fish on every other cast. No monster white crappie, but lots of respectable 9-11 inch blacks and incredible numbers of slab bluegills and pumpkinseeds running 8-10 inches long. By 5pm we were glad to call it a day. Sunday we were on our own, but Kyle gave us a couple of decent shore spots to check out. Morning started slow with next to nothing for crappie and the odd decent blue gill. Walked and pitched a long the one bank until I found a good hole loaded with perch. Spent 3 solid hours on that one spot weeding through dozens of dinks, but for every 5-6 dinks there was a decent keeper. Sadly all good things must end and we called it a day at 2pm. The bite was still hot but the 5 hour drive was not going to get any easier if we stayed later. We were home by 7pm and were cleaning perch until dark. Despite the lack of walleye it was a great fishing trip. One we will probably do again. Kyle worked to get us on fish and we caught lots, and we had a blast."
998976,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-03 12:49:00,8243,You guys are a bunch of wild men. Isn't it a bit early yet for the Detroit River? I have heard good things about Kyle Moxon but that had to be a tough fish with the single digit temps Bruce. When we fished it I remember crystal clear water being key and warm spring rays on the face. The key was you guys had a good time. Is this son the Dad of that beautiful baby I met at the tackle swap? I don't know what I was thinking I should have bought many more jigs from you than I did for those prices. Maybe I'll take a ride one day and meet you close to your place.

The bite had started a week earlier but shut down with the rain.  That little girl belongs to my daughter, she was also at the show. Rob has 3 daughters from 1-6 years old."

999557,moxie,2017-04-07 14:42:00,1566,Good for you. Might as well make the best of it once you're out there. We're heading down the wknd of the 21st for the first time ever. Should be in full swing.....we hope. I'm thinking we should bring the crappie gear just in case? Fingers crossed.
