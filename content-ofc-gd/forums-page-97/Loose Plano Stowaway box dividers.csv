999494,KraTToR,2017-04-06 21:41:00,506,How do you affix your dividers in your plano stowaways?I try to cut them apart with a bit of flashing left on it for a snug fit but sometimes they just break off clean and then they don't fit tight.Not sure if a super glue would work on that material either.Thoughts?
