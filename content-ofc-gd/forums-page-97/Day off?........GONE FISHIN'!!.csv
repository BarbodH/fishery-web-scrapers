The ice is worse than I thought, drilled a couple holes in the morning and although there is 18""+ it is honeycomb already for the most part, auger went through it like a hot knife through butter, guess its down to the thaw we had earlier in the year and then almost zero snow since without a mother thaw afterwards.  the crappie decided to show up on my spot on Wabigoon really late, oh well, will be hunting them in the boat pretty soon.  The walleye I caught in the evening were at another lake just up the road. I usually quad all the way there from my house across the lakes and skidoo trails but wanted to take Roloff with me so we trailered up there. Landing was toast and had to travel half a click to find ice strong enough to walk out on, drilled a couple holes, same deal as Wabigoon, 18"" of honeycomb sketchiness, lol...so I jumped on the quad and pinned it to my spot. Got 4 walleye, one female 3 males, not anywhere near their spawning ground yet, which was a good thing for me as there was no way I was going near the creek!  Here's the video as usual.   "

999479,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-06 21:07:00,8243,Be careful on that silly season ice. Many an experienced northerner without the UK accent has been lost. Sometimes experience is a most hazardous asset.
999506,spincast,2017-04-06 23:31:00,3279,"love the way you set up the cam to get yourself coming at it from the distance. Not sure where you find the time to put these all together and then upload with dial up? click upload, leave for work and come home as ""select your thumbnail"" message appears? I was surprised you have grass already? as far as your fishing opportunities and location, meh, who would want that? a lake at your door? some of the finest fishing in Ontario a quick quad ride away - nah, your welcome to it."
