997965,Meegs,2017-03-25 11:29:00,249,Hope you put them to good use Rob!  Seasons just around the corner
998003,misfish,2017-03-25 21:03:00,29133,"Very nice James. Im not surprised, at all."
998033,Rattletrap2,2017-03-26 12:56:00,1652,Beautiful workmanship Meegs! A true artist!
998196,Meegs,2017-03-27 17:41:00,249,Thankyou!   I've been doing alot more body baits lately.  Going on store shelves soon!
998201,Big Cliff,2017-03-27 18:12:00,6899,"It would be ashamed to see those used, they truly are works of art. I have an air brush kit that was loaned/given to me by another member, some day I hope to be able to use it properly but I doubt I'll ever reach your level of expertise."
998219,craigdritchie,2017-03-27 20:32:00,1586,My good bud Darrell Wood hand-paints some incredible looking baits. Check out his Facebook page. 
999688,PUMP KNOWS,2017-04-09 01:30:00,937,"Hope you put them to good use Rob! Seasons just around the corner  Hey Meegs, how much do you charge to get some lures done?"
999724,Meegs,2017-04-09 11:54:00,249,Generally 5 bucks a bait.  More if they are musky sized.
999727,GbayGiant,2017-04-09 13:14:00,1780,My good bud XXXXX XXXX hand-paints some incredible looking baits. Check out his. that was appropriate!
999738,Terry,2017-04-09 14:54:00,14456,"i see your point others were giving pointers, where as that was just a plug for lure sales"
994545,kickingfrog,2017-02-16 23:30:00,8333,So what paint would you use if you were going to paint some hard baits?
994550,manitoubass2,2017-02-17 00:05:00,11391,"I don't do it often, and it's just for fun.  But I've used acrylics covered in enamel and even nail polish lol  One of my best baits ever was recoloured this way"
994551,grimsbylander,2017-02-17 00:06:00,3016,"I stole some of my wife's nail polish! It worked great, just degrease the bait with nail polish remover or acetone first. Plus there are a plethora of colors, finishes, and sparkles. The little brush is super handy too!  I know too much about this..."
994552,grimsbylander,2017-02-17 00:06:00,3016,Glad Rick knew about nail polish as well!! LOL
994553,manitoubass2,2017-02-17 00:07:00,11391,^^^???
994554,rockin-steelhead,2017-02-17 00:08:00,19,Check this place out for paints http://luremaking.com/catalogue/catalogue-index/lure_paints-index.htm
994555,manitoubass2,2017-02-17 00:09:00,11391, My first go with an airbrush was a disaster. I gave up quickly lol  I also like the fact that when the lure gets beat up you already have everything to fix it!  Also I bought alot of glow in the dark paints in the craft section at Walmart. Super cheap. But about 50% of them won't coat properly but others worked awesome!
994557,kickingfrog,2017-02-17 00:29:00,8333,And now for the rest of the story... I do use nail polish to tweak baits but in this case I'm hoping to completely repaint some lures in patterns/colours that the manufactures in their infinite wisdom have discontinued.
994558,spincast,2017-02-17 00:39:00,3279,"While I haven't tried the airbrush option yet, I think that is where you will end up based on the last comment. I have tried powder coats with just about every other method, permanent markers (although I haven't tried nail polish yet?) and while they do an OK job, its really difficult ( impossible for me) to get the fine detail I want.  I have caught fish on some, and many may say that the lures catch more fisherman that fish, but hey, if your gonna do it, I believe it oughta look like what I would be willin' to pay for. When I find an airbrush kit for the right price it's on the list."
994559,manitoubass2,2017-02-17 00:40:00,11391,"Rob, it was posted on here a few years back, I've since lost the site. But I believe it's was a Finnish forum and had an INSANE thread on customizing and painting lures. I mean insane works of art. Like one guy was making lures that were wrapped with real fish skin  Anyhow, it had every tip method etc available. But the post is like 2000 pages long lol  Maybe someone here remembers it?  On second thought  it might on an Ohio fishing forum???"
994560,porkpie,2017-02-17 00:41:00,2521,"If your on Facebook, there is a guy on 705 anglers goes by Kahshe Lake lure company.  He sells custom painted hardbaits, and I'm willing to bet he would do repaints.  He puts out some very nice work.  Just a thought."
994561,Tom S,2017-02-17 00:49:00,362,"I would probably give model paints a try, followed by a dip clear coat. Model paints should allow a good variety of colours and they will spray or brush without much trouble. A good dip of a clear coat meant for flooring use will help it hold over time."

994579,Korber,2017-02-17 12:53:00,79,Nail polish seems like a brilliant idea!
994584,Meegs,2017-02-17 13:28:00,249,Nail Polish works on a small scale. It's good to change or add a certain color but goes on too thick and you will never get the detail you want. Powder paints are no good for bodybaits either. Best by far is an airbrush and thin out acrylic paint or buy createx airbrush paint. Trouble is that it gets very expensive if you're only planning on doing a couple lures. A cheap airbrush and compressor will run you 120$ and around 6 bucks per color of paint you want. You will also need a good epoxy clearcoat and need to put them on a turner for best clearcoat results! So if your only looking to rent do afew lures it will cost 200 or more to get everything to do the job right! I started into the bodybaits myself last year but I already have all the equipment. I'm sure I can give you a hand if you need any help.
994587,manitoubass2,2017-02-17 13:35:00,11391,Nice work meegs!!!
994588,Meegs,2017-02-17 13:42:00,249,Thankyou!  There fun to paint.  Ordering 1000 blanks in next few weeks to do after ice season slows down

Those look great, thanks for the offer, I'll keep that in mind."

995231,Tom S,2017-02-23 00:46:00,362,You could also check out a product called JigSkinz. It's a heat shrink wrap that was developed to allow you to refresh beaten up lures or refinish new ones. They have some excellent looking realistic finishes.
997897,kickingfrog,2017-03-24 17:35:00,8333,"Well I dropped off some lures for Meegs to paint.    This started because my brother's favourite topwater lure on dark/cloudy days is a super spook in a firetiger pattern and they no longer make the bait in that colour. I picked up some bone coloured super spooks, then figured that I'd get some other lures painted. I went through some of my older pike lures and picked a few that I hardly ever use and figured if they were firetiger I'd might try them more.  And as I type this the Jays are on the tv. Come on opener!   Thanks again Meegs!   "
997924,manitoubass2,2017-03-24 20:23:00,11391,Wow! Great job!!!  They look slick! That spook???
997950,PUMP KNOWS,2017-03-25 00:21:00,937,Badass... firetiger is my fav colourway
