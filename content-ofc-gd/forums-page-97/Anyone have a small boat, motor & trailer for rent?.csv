Beat up tinner is fine, so long as the trailer and motor are reliable. 14-16ft preferable.  He plans on taking it 885km north and back.  Thanks!"
999891,Old Ironmaker,2017-04-10 17:46:00,8243,"We have one for you but I don't think you are going to drive to Lake Erie to get it, 6 hours on a good day with all that crazy traffic from Orillia to Hamilton. We wouldn't even know what a fair price is. I do remember renting a nice 17 foot Aluminum with a 25 elec. start on it back in the early 90's when we stayed in your neck of the woods. Cozy Cove Cottages, nice place, great fishing, my best ever Walleye that week from Nippising, 29"" and thick. It was $750.00 for the week and that was a very long time ago, it was the same price as the nice cottage for the week. I can't imagine what a rental goes for now. Nothing further north where he is heading? You can't swing a cat without hitting water."
