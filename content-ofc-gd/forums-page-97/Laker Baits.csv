999114,BillM,2017-04-04 16:50:00,17367,I love those big paddle tails Dave!  Great for spring pike as well
999115,DRIFTER_016,2017-04-04 17:06:00,10439,I love those big paddle tails Dave!  Great for spring pike as well  Yup. The big squids are good for troots. You stick an egg sinker in the head and run your leader through it. Slide a crimp on your leader and then tie on a hook. Crimp the crimp to stop the hook from sliding all the way to the sinker and jig or troll away.

999117,BillM,2017-04-04 17:14:00,17367,I've never tried the squid bait but it's worth a shot.

Im wondering if a large 1oz jig would work better, instead if the eggs sinker for jigging. Going to have to give this a try."

No they aren't but the regular price on the squids is cheap @ $1.99 a piece. $3.99 for the 12 1/2"" ones if you want to go that big.  http://www.basspro.com/Offshore-Angler-Squid-Skirts/product/1408050710291/?cmCat=CROSSSELL_CATEGORY_VTR2"

999751,BillM,2017-04-09 16:07:00,17367,Those look pretty deadly.  Any issues with the tentacles getting snagged up in the treble when jigging?
