999098,mukluk,2017-04-04 13:19:00,196,Thanks Mark.  Everything runs better with addition of seafoam in my opinion.
999329,Yellow Fever,2017-04-05 21:43:00,139,Great price....just convinced my buddy to pick up a can while we were in Canadian Tire..for 12 a can. So i went and bought 14 cans
999490,Mister G,2017-04-06 21:35:00,1429,It 's like a mechanic in a can for only $7.99
999496,leaf4,2017-04-06 21:52:00,2466,Would this be good for adding to my mower gas or would it be unnecessary
999572,jimmer,2017-04-07 16:16:00,2730,It helps any gas powered item. Ethanol does a number on anything.
