Josh Douglas, a successful and well-known FLW Tour pro is hosting a FREE webinar next Tues. Oct. 23, 2018 and share with everyone how to Utilize your Navionics maps alongside your electronics to catch more fish. Josh is very personable and extremely knowledgeable, the beauty about catching a webinar like this live is that you can ask your own questions after his presentation.

1035405,OhioFisherman,2018-10-17 23:47:00,6623,After watching a bunch of tournament videos and seeing how closely those guys are glued to their depth finder screens learning all you can about them seems like a very good idea!

When I got my very 1st "" Eagle Ultra Fish Finder"" that actually beeped and showed a graphic of a fish everyone in the boat was crowded around the little thing. No one watching where in H we were going of course until we bumped a rock. I actually still have it and it works. We have come a very long way when it comes to electronics and fishing in a short 25 years when the screens came out. Before that we had to contend with paper graphs and flashers and way back then they were the Cat's meow."
