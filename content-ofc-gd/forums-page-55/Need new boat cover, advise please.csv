I don't expect it to last long but I need one while the boat waits in line to get shrink-wrapped. How long a cover for the 19'6"" StarCraft. I will remove the tall casting seat up front and put in one of the passenger seats folded down. About 26"" high folded down. Any recommendations please? A few hundred bucks is fine. I have seen some CTC specials not much thicker than saranwrap."

I was a bit skeptical when I booked my appointment, but pleasantly surprised when I picked it up! He did a really nice job!"

Looking for a temporary cover like they sell at Crappy Tire until I can get mine made this spring. If it were in the budget I would do it over the winter but still need something to cover it now. I don't think she can match that deal though. 700 bucks for a travel cover, no engine covers. Sunbrella."

I park inside a portable garage so they just need to keep the dust out of my boat and as such I don't need a high quality cover. The last one I bought lasted me 10 years before finally getting destroyed when I used it to cover my hovercraft for the ride back from Wisconsin last spring. Currently have a super cheap $50 one keeping the dust out."
