1035972,BillM,2018-11-02 04:21:00,17367,Haven't touched the pin yet.  Although the itch has started.
1035985,AKRISONER,2018-11-02 17:14:00,5558,"can we all agree, fishing for anything is better than working? if i had to choose between fishing rock bass and working...i know what im picking  Thread closed lol"
1035987,BillM,2018-11-02 17:16:00,17367,"Rock bass is an easy choice, especially on a 4wt"
1035997,Jds63,2018-11-02 19:34:00,1365,yes ... yes ... get me out of cubicle  !!!!!!
1035998,Dutch01,2018-11-02 19:36:00,1431,"Since we're pointing out ""wrongs"", it's ""you're doing it wrong"" ? PS walleye for the win!"
1036000,misfish,2018-11-02 20:14:00,29133,Getting close to that.
1035857,porkpie,2018-10-30 01:41:00,2521,Your doing it wrong. 
1035859,grimsbylander,2018-10-30 03:16:00,3016,"We'll let the perch, crappie, bluegill, etc. panfish crowd know they're wasting their time."
1035860,grimsbylander,2018-10-30 03:18:00,3016,"Or, maybe he's doing it right and has his own opinion? We all don't fish the same fish the same way. To each his own."
1035861,Chuck Enwinde,2018-10-30 05:23:00,247,"I don't care who you are, that's funny. This whole thing is like arguing that oranges are better than bananas  Besides...... Brookies reign supreme and golf is indeed a noble pursuit.  ? "
1035864,porkpie,2018-10-30 11:30:00,2521,You know we are just winding up bass guys for fun right?
1035865,AKRISONER,2018-10-30 12:07:00,5558,"fished what is arguably the best salmon fishery in the world in the queen charlotte islands, caught a ridiculous amount of cohos, springs and even some halibut, sharks and rock fish to boot...give me topwater smallmouth fishing any day. dont get me wrong, its fun...but trolling is still the most boring form of fishing...i guess it might be better than jigging walleye lol"
1035867,Acountdeleted,2018-10-30 14:22:00,2562,"Agree 100%. I’ll take video game fishing (ice fishing with a flasher) over trolling any day. You catch less fish but if I can coax a fish into biting, the reward is that much sweeter."
1035868,OhioFisherman,2018-10-30 14:26:00,6623,"LOL, an 8# walleye fights just as well as an 8# sheephead!"
1035872,Acountdeleted,2018-10-30 15:34:00,2562,Ha. No. Not in my experience anyways. My buddy who is a personal trainer had a 12 lb sheepshead kick his butt. Never had a walleye tire anyone else or have anyone say ‘take the rod for me’
1035873,lew,2018-10-30 15:57:00,12766,Any of you folks who don't like trolling need to try trolling for muskies with your rod mounted near the stern of the boat with only 4'- 5' of line out. Not much gets the heart pounding better than a big ole musky hammering your bait within arms reach of where your sitting LOL Only other thing better is a musky coming from under your boat and slamming you lure on a figure 8 right under your nose.
1035874,BillM,2018-10-30 16:20:00,17367,"yeah 5lb specs are awful fish and no one should even bother fishing for them, lol."
1035876,AKRISONER,2018-10-30 17:23:00,5558,hopefully he doesnt...more for me lol
1035880,misfish,2018-10-30 23:46:00,29133,"I think I tried for bass 2-3 times this year. Word ya,ll.. I was more into targeting lakers. Looking for that Simcoe brute has become my mission. Simcoe smallies are a blast and fight like demons, but the sound of a reel screaming with a fish in the depths, I am all over that. As for pickeral. They are not searched for size or fight. They are searched for eats. I hear they are good eats. Me, they are lazy fish to search for. Have heard they were like catching perch this year on Erie. You can take that flasher and well,,,,,,,,,,,,, LOL Nothing like taking 20 minutes to set up, and catching fish the first few minutes. I think you know what I am talking about. No flasher required. LOL"
1035882,SirCranksalot,2018-10-31 02:38:00,3291,I agree. Totally overrated. Best to leave them alone! 
1035883,Chuck Enwinde,2018-10-31 04:07:00,247,"It's different when you're the guy calling the shots and putting the game plan together.  If you're just along for the ride, then yeah."
1035884,porkpie,2018-10-31 10:36:00,2521,Good point.  Nothing makes me happier than 4 guys in the boat juggling an 8 rod spread. Especially if rods are popping.  Fire drill!!
1035885,Acountdeleted,2018-10-31 12:16:00,2562," I have a rule, bass in the summer, lakers in the winter........... I'm not sure I catch much else to be honest.  For those of us that don't have the signature 'B whistle' that practically calls fish out of the hole sometimes a flasher is all it takes to keep me from insanity. Before having it a few times I remember staring down a frozen hole with no bites in a few hours thinking 'what the %^&* am I doing?'"
1035887,crappieperchhunter,2018-10-31 13:03:00,2582,"I love bass. Easy to catch, abundant and put up a good fight. But most importantly lotsa people fish for them. Which is good because while those clowns are targeting bass they are leaving the fish that I'm after alone?"
1035889,AKRISONER,2018-10-31 13:58:00,5558,"as is always when im in a boat, because i fish a lot, I am always involved in the decision making process. On my uncles boat it was just the same, i made as many decisions as I wanted to make. When im trolling laketrout on Georgian bay with my old man i make 95% of the decisions. Im not hating on it, dont get me wrong its a good time, but to me it still pales in comparison. There were days in the charlottes where you couldnt get the riggers down through the coho to get at the springs, its good fun absolutely, but when you eliminate casting and feeling a bite, a lot of fishing is lost to me. Ever caught a 4+lb big lake smallmouth on a walk the dog lure? Not a heck of a lot beats that. I am not hating on salmon either they are insane. Best fight ive ever had was hooking salmon nymphing with a 5 wt in the credit. I literally had to run after the fish to stop it from spooling me. Ever felt a 40+ inch musky hit your swimbait boatside? Not much compares to that."
1035897,Acountdeleted,2018-10-31 15:58:00,2562,"So this is a true story for you walleye guys out there.  When I was younger I had the joy of working in North West Ontario for a couple of summers. One day in Dryden a friend of a friend says 'we are going to our secret lake. You will catch more fish then you have in your life'. So we get to the spot, find the dropoff and mark it with a marker bouy and from that point on we were off to the races. In 45 minutes 4 of us each had our limit plus boated a few more. They all wanted to go home and go back to bed but I wanted to fish a little more. I begged them to stay a few more minutes and they said I could catch one more fish. So I cast my jig out and hook into one. I reel up, it runs down to the bottom, I reel up, it runs down to the bottom again. I get it close to the surface AND REALIZE I HOOKED INTO THE MARKER BOUY. ??. The guys say 'thanks Jer. We needed to retrieve that anyways.' and we promptly went home.  If I'm being honest, it was the best fight I had all day. ??"
1035946,Sinker,2018-11-01 13:53:00,8692,"Theres a time and place for everything.  I love fishing panfish in the spring. The problem with bass, FOR ME, is the season for everything else is open when they open.  I""m a musky guy. 61 musky graced my net this year so far. Why would I fish for cute little bass??  S.  "
1035948,grimsbylander,2018-11-01 14:53:00,3016,
1035949,Sinker,2018-11-01 15:14:00,8692,Its not even fair to compare specks with bass.........or any other fish! 
1035951,Mister G,2018-11-01 15:45:00,1429,Compared smoked musky and smoked bass..............well smoked bass taste like a$$
1035960,BillM,2018-11-01 22:20:00,17367,"I'm just busting balls man    I've been fishing my butt off these past weeks and have boated exactly 1 muskie, lol!   Ah well.  Still fun!"
1035726,captpierre,2018-10-27 03:31:00,2521,
1035727,BillM,2018-10-27 03:55:00,17367,"Saw this on the Lund Boat group on FaceySpace today, lol."
1035728,grimsbylander,2018-10-27 03:59:00,3016,I'm going to get rich by creating a spell checker for memes lol
1035729,OhioFisherman,2018-10-27 04:38:00,6623,"LOL, I remember seeing the charter captain with the blind group on Lake Erie trolling for walleye, even they caught them."
1035730,OhioFisherman,2018-10-27 04:41:00,6623,"LOL, at least they spelled Pickerel right?"
1035753,John Bacon,2018-10-27 17:19:00,3277,"Yeah, they really messed up the spelling of muskie on that one.  ?"
1035754,spincast,2018-10-27 17:28:00,3279,"those who need it don't know it, and those who know it don't need it. , just sayin....."
1035757,Rizzo,2018-10-27 18:13:00,4754,haha so true...stupid bass
1035784,Dutch01,2018-10-28 16:13:00,1431,I'll just leave this here....  
1035790,porkpie,2018-10-28 18:01:00,2521,Spelling is an entirely separate matter from the issue at hand.  Bass will eat beer cans with hooks attached and walleye are harder to catch:)
1035791,OhioFisherman,2018-10-28 18:04:00,6623,Bass like beer and walleye don't?
1035793,porkpie,2018-10-28 18:07:00,2521,"Our picks don't like American beer, they say it's watery"
1035794,Moosebunk,2018-10-28 18:54:00,3970,"This thread is tooo funny. I want to steal, copy and paste all of it to every bass page everywhere. lol."
1035796,OhioFisherman,2018-10-28 19:13:00,6623,https://troegs.com/beer/mad-elf/ Pop a top on a few of these!
1035798,DanD,2018-10-28 21:02:00,2223,Here's a beer that any self respecting Walleye would like. http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo/product/duvel/379990#.W9Yd6ntKj3g Even with its 8.5% it's a smooth beer that can kick your ass and you won't know it till you try and stand up.  Belgium is not big in the world scene; but they know how to brew a great beer. Not cheap but get a 4 pack and cool it just short of freezing and enjoy. Dan. 
1035802,OhioFisherman,2018-10-29 00:44:00,6623,"LOL, Dan MS has had me walking like a drunk since 2004, I don't need to add alcohol! I just look at what my kids buy and get a buzz."
1035807,Mister G,2018-10-29 11:03:00,1429,When bass fishermen are not fishing they are golfing........and golfing was invented for those who failed at fishing.........just saying...
1035815,grimsbylander,2018-10-29 13:59:00,3016,"Considering how easy bass fishing is, I'm really surprised more of the ""experts"" here aren't cashing in on the easy money of tournament fishing! LOL"
1035817,KawarthaAngler,2018-10-29 14:14:00,273,And after you say that you drop the mic and walk out. LOL
1035819,Acountdeleted,2018-10-29 14:50:00,2562,"Walleye are more difficult to hook into then bass, I'll give you that one (Except in Northern Ontario. There everything is easy to catch) But in terms of fight its not even close. I'd rather reel a water soaked log off the bottom of the lake then fight a walleye."
1035824,Sinker,2018-10-29 15:55:00,8692,"Yeah, maybe, but a big bass is what.....5 or 6 lbs? Real fish eat them for lunch. I just can't see the point in fishing for a species of fish, where a big one is only 5lbs.  Seriously, whats the point?  S."
1035830,captpierre,2018-10-29 17:10:00,2521,Lack of fight for eyes is not my experience jigging. Maybe trolling
1035833,Acountdeleted,2018-10-29 17:26:00,2562,"I can never garentee I have a bass in the boat unless I'm lipping it. The jumps, the runs, the run into cover. In a kayak this past summer I had a bass practically pull me into the lily pads. I was able to turn him around and he made a beeline right towards the boat where he jumped a few good feet in the air then proceeded to walk along the top of the water. Big fish are nice but I love the acrobatics and the head shakes of bass. I'd love to hook into some 10 pounders down in the states.  Now that being said, if we all wanted big fish that are difficult to catch in freshwater, we should all go carp fishing. ?"
1035835,SirCranksalot,2018-10-29 17:33:00,3291,"Same here, except the fish tastes a bit better!! I think of them as dishrags"
1035851,AKRISONER,2018-10-29 23:06:00,5558,"with a comment like that, i hope you fish musky...also...largemouth go 20+ lbs so they actually get heavier than walleye lol. Our climate in Ontario just doesnt allow it. i get it...guys like fishing salmon, but trolling is probably the crappiest form of fishing around. Yes, ill be the first to admit swinging a salmon on the fly in a river is top notch fishing, but you arent gonna have many 50 fish days doing that either.  I will make one comment about the MEME I never have had a day where I anchored and didnt switch baits and caught 50 bass...ive done it walleye fishing though."
