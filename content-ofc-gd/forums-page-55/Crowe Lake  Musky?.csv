1036636,lew,2018-11-17 12:53:00,12766,Some nice fish in St. Francis      
1036638,Rizzo,2018-11-17 13:23:00,4754,apparently there are some nice ones! That destination has been on my mind...just too far for the one or two day ventures I go on currently
1036714,David Chong,2018-11-19 21:09:00,836,Lake St. Francis has some monsters and would assume decent numbers as I almost catch one every time I'm out there but I'm fishing for bass!
