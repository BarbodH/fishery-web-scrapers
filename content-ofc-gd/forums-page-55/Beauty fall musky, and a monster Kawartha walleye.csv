1035776,Tjames09,2018-10-28 05:43:00,664,"I think it was how it was being held, I had my hand behind him not underneath. But he was also cold and stiff with the cold water. Usually they are down in all my other walleye pictures. It’s probably just good luck haha.   Thanks for for the comments guys. This was two different days but both in the fall colder water."
