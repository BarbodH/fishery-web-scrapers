1035326,jimmer,2018-10-16 17:58:00,2730,Kind of cold to be falling in the water at this time of the year.  Hopefully they find him.  https://www.kawartha411.ca/2018/10/16/police-search-for-boater-missing-on-lake-scugog/?fbclid=IwAR0VgclOSwpW2J3rl_1K2-Mz6SQ7JqevbNDZuMF3N-sGi2mcNggQkuTa9Ic
1035341,David Chong,2018-10-16 21:07:00,836,"WOW, hopefully, they find him safe & sound! Hypothermia can happen quickly with the surface temps right now!"
1035347,GBW,2018-10-16 22:26:00,8460,More info on the story here https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/8968245-police-fire-marine-units-scouring-lake-scugog-for-missing-canoeist/
1035348,Rizzo,2018-10-16 22:41:00,4754,Wow I am shocked. It was crazy windy all over southern ontario yesterday definitely not canoeing weather. Hopefully this story turns out better than it sounds
1035366,Rattletrap2,2018-10-17 01:45:00,1652,"Rizzo, I'm with you on this one! Obviously I'm hoping for the best, but I drove home around that time last night and could not believe how brutal the winds were! Skies were black as coal and rains too! Geez, we had snow on our back deck yesterday evening! The last place I would want to be is out on a lake, and in a canoe to boot!"
1035372,fishindevil,2018-10-17 11:00:00,6254,and he wasn't wearing a life jacket ...... again in this just keeps hapeneing
1035373,maksuttt,2018-10-17 12:08:00,21,Hopefully he's safe. 80% of drowning cases are due to not wearing PFD. Even with life jacket on in that cold water chances to survive are slim...
1035384,David Chong,2018-10-17 18:38:00,836,"Yes, sadly even with a PFD on with the colder temps hypothermia is the killer!"
1035411,GBW,2018-10-18 02:25:00,8460,"Just seen on FB (10:20PM Oct 17/18), he has ""been found"" so I take those words as a body has been recovered..."
1035412,GBW,2018-10-18 03:16:00,8460,the person I quoted has retracted the quote so here is to a small glimmer of hope...
1035429,jimmer,2018-10-18 18:14:00,2730,Tough to see any hope when it's been this long and we haven't heard anything. Probably trying to find the body now.
1035697,KawarthaAngler,2018-10-26 12:43:00,273,"I guess this individual was never found, thus no further news reportings?"
1035698,jimmer,2018-10-26 12:46:00,2730,Not that I have heard of....
1035700,AKRISONER,2018-10-26 12:57:00,5558,"very odd as bodies after sinking typically float back...scugog is so shallow too, youd think someone fishing or something may have ran into him....horrific"
1035716,Rizzo,2018-10-26 22:14:00,4754,I have been wondering about this man as well.
1035875,fishindevil,2018-10-30 16:22:00,6254,they are still actively looking for him I heard about it on the radio this morning  they have also found several of his belongings but have not found him yet
1035879,ecmilley,2018-10-30 23:33:00,2163,
1035947,Sinker,2018-11-01 14:01:00,8692,"Possibly. Also, with these temps, it will take a long time for a body to float. Water was only 36 yesterday. Its cold. S."
1035982,lunkerbasshunter,2018-11-02 15:06:00,2585,"Got to wonder why you would risk it in a canoe.  When most bigger boats with motors and deep vs are put away, you think you can get out there in a canoe?  The water would kill you in minutes at these temps. Sad story, sorry to the family and friends"
1036015,Sinker,2018-11-03 13:57:00,8692,"Yeah, I do wonder what their reasoning was. It was a very windy, nasty day too.  S."
1036329,Rattletrap2,2018-11-11 03:23:00,1652,It seems like this Fisherman has still not been found? Terrible for his family.
1036334,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-11 06:32:00,8243,"I always wonder if some of these incidents where intelligent people go out in freezing temps and bad weather, no PFD's in a small craft may be suicide. An accidental death can leave the survivors debt free with many thousands or more in the bank. Hard for insurance investigators to prove otherwise without a note."
1036385,LeXXington,2018-11-12 14:30:00,1928,unfortunately insurance will not payout without a body.
