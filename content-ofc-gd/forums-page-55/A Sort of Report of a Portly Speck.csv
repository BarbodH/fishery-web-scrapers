1036422,Headhunter,2018-11-13 13:26:00,5703,"I believe that the word ""corpulent"" may be more appropriate. HH"
1036423,dave524,2018-11-13 13:43:00,4508,"Beauty, nice that there is now some lakes open after the traditional end of Sept closer, they do colour up real pretty in spawning  season. My years in Haliburton , took a few late Sept weeks holiday when the partridge opening week and the last week of specs overlapped, but they were not in full colour yet. "
1036427,msp,2018-11-13 14:33:00,1336,Awesome !
1036429,chris.brock,2018-11-13 15:00:00,4053,Chuck is putting on a clinic as usual! That's a handsome specimen.

1036625,Moosebunk,2018-11-17 02:58:00,3970,Daaaaaang dude!!! That there's a purdy one!
1036627,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-17 03:07:00,8243,OMG was my 1st reaction. I have only even seen a few Speckled Trout in my life and were the size of that beasts tail. I thought I would see a pic of Mr. Bunk holding that behemoth. Photo shop? You both have a resemblance. Older bro? That's a compliment Charles.
1036649,chris.brock,2018-11-17 16:46:00,4053,"here's a better, close up picture of Chuck when he's not all bundled up-  "
1036650,misfish,2018-11-17 17:04:00,29133,"Thats not Chuck, thats Jason McCoy from the road hammers. LOL."
1036658,Joeytier,2018-11-17 20:35:00,3990,"Awesome speck! The larger ones can be a tough nut to crack late in the fall, but they dont come much prettier than that. Heres a little smaller one from a week back.  When you get lucky with a warm sun and calm winds in late fall you can end up having a bit of a feeding frenzy. "
1036688,Chuck Enwinde,2018-11-19 07:49:00,247,"Thanks Guys.  That's a beauty hen there Joey.  But I don't recall any nice days this fall lol and it seems like it's already over. Lol B, if I don't see you at the ice show, I'm mailing those floats.  "
1036689,misfish,2018-11-19 13:20:00,29133,"I,ll be there both days Chuck, and got those fly's still."
1036820,Freshtrax,2018-11-21 05:06:00,2215,Beauty fish chuck... lets go back up that dirt road again next year to see if we can find some  more like that !
