1036503,Yellow Fever,2018-11-15 12:14:00,139,Any custom painters on here (lures of course ) I have some US painters but somebody on here must paint or know someone

1036561,DanD,2018-11-16 11:36:00,2223,"Why not get your own airbrush and try painting yourself? Princess Auto has a brush on sale right now; 55 bucks regularly 90. A small compressor and you're good to go. Now if you're like me; as in having to be 3/4s in the bag, to even draw a stick person; forget it. LOL Airbruch Dan."
1036562,misfish,2018-11-16 11:39:00,29133,"Look at the price 6 years ago. LOL ★★★★★ ★★★★★ 4 out of 5 stars. · 6 years ago Like the other post, it is a Beaver B200 model repackaged by Power Fist. Quality is great for the $39.99 sale price. The hose it comes with is not the best, so I recommend upgrading the hose before use. Spray is consistent and works well. Hard to find replacement parts if you break/lose something but PA is amazing for exchanging defects!"
1036563,Yellow Fever,2018-11-16 11:54:00,139,I can't draw a straight line with a ruler.. ..no way am i painting lures. Those people have a chemical imbalance to do that. I shake my head in amazement when i look at what some people are capable of
1036565,DanD,2018-11-16 11:56:00,2223,"What hasn't gone up in price, in the last 6 years; but you're right it is a kick in the backside. Dan."
1036566,DanD,2018-11-16 12:17:00,2223,This may sound crazy; but try going to a few auto body shops? You may find someone that would like some airbrush work to practice their skill? Dan.
1036606,Meegs,2018-11-16 21:29:00,249,I do quite abit of everything from blades to musky baits.   If I cant do it I know another couple that can!
1036609,misfish,2018-11-16 22:41:00,29133,"Buddy, I was at Tom,s this morning. The mini meegs, are going to be killer."
1036613,Meegs,2018-11-16 23:01:00,249,Thanks man!   I think so aswell!  Pretty pumped!
1036616,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-17 02:34:00,8243,"I think we put far too much into the details of the painting of lures. Fish aren't art critics, just hungry hopefully. I think we have all caught fish from our favorite lures that had most if not all the paint peeled off it. I know I have. There is a Husky Jerk I have retired that is basically all white now after all the Pike and hammer handles I have hooked on it from the Ottawa."
1036618,bigugli,2018-11-17 02:42:00,6138,"THere is a time for detail and a time for simplicity. Depends if you are going for the reaction strike, or trying to tease in that immovable beast in the weeds. "
1036637,dave524,2018-11-17 13:02:00,4508,"but high definition , photo realistic paints jobs seem to be necessary to catch the fisherman ?"
1036661,Snidley,2018-11-17 21:19:00,620,I used to use a guy I met at Curry's Art Supply. He was a goalie/catchers  mask artist. I have since lost touch with him but try Kijiji and don't just look for lure painters or ask atya local art supply shop for airbrushers.
1036664,misfish,2018-11-17 21:52:00,29133,"  Well since you guys think it catches fisher people, I can give you a prime example here, about how  just a touch of one color makes a difference. My buddy was just feet away from me. Both using the same jig. He was killing me on the hook ups. Did I say same jig ? Yes we were, but his had a spot of red on the under lip of the jig.  I was marking just as many fish as he was. I switched up and it was non stop action for both of us. This is true, or may the whitefish gods strike me down. "
1036686,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-18 22:26:00,8243,I do believe colour matters but not as much as some do i.e. Live Target.
1036687,misfish,2018-11-18 22:37:00,29133,"I wish I had a steel leader on my Live Target  perch bait the day I was out with Lew on Nip. First cast,hit,yank and it gone. Another true story."
