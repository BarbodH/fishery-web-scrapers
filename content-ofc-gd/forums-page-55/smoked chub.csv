1036558,DRIFTER_016,2018-11-16 04:34:00,10439,Hoodie.  ?
1036502,muskybw,2018-11-15 11:52:00,116,"i made a comment last night on a great fishing pic, about smoked chub, tasty snack 10 yrs. ago,  i have not seen any for sale in my travels in the last 10 yrs. ?  where can you buy smoked chub in ontario ? thanks."
1036504,Spiel,2018-11-15 14:03:00,9065,I used to buy smoked chub in Southampton. 	I've no idea if it's still available there?  	FYI.....Chub is Herring.  http://jsfresh.fish/
1036506,OhioFisherman,2018-11-15 14:11:00,6623,"Like 40  years ago I was buying bait at a bait shop in Pointe Au Baril and the guy tried to put one in my bucket, since I had never seen one before I stopped him and asked what is that? He called it a moon eye, and I passed on that one for bait, just didn't know if it was a legal species for bait. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coregonus_hoyi"
1036507,Woodsman,2018-11-15 14:19:00,1286,Never heard herring called chub. When I hear chub I think of this smaller fish. Creek chub
1036509,Spiel,2018-11-15 15:03:00,9065,The smoked chub from the Great Lakes Commercial Fishery are Bloater. 	I should have said Cisco rather than Herring.   https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/suresh-doss-hammerheads-1.4904861?fbclid=IwAR0pg3HWgb7T1fIKF1baosKDKSuBasGYeCaokaLAAkcgq0XaSXip_JMNYqw  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coregonus_hoyi
1036511,DanD,2018-11-15 15:17:00,2223,Loblaws use to have them in the fresh fish department; that you bought by weight. they were not prepackaged. Just did a search on their site and all that came up were these? Loblaws  Dan. 
1036518,muskybw,2018-11-15 16:09:00,116,"SPIEL , thanks--- i was introduced to smoked chub 10-15 yrs. ago at denny's dam in southhampton. rainbow fishing late october. i native guy had a cooler full of these smoked chubs in the back of his pick-up. $ 2 bucks each., about 5-6 in. long, looked like a fat smelt. they really stunk, great taste with a cold beer.  the cooler was empty in short time.   WHERE'S THE SMOKED CHUB ??"
1036519,Spiel,2018-11-15 16:13:00,9065,You're welcome. 	I'm sure they're still available in Southampton and some of the other commercial ports around Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.
1036520,muskybw,2018-11-15 16:16:00,116,"DAND thanks, they look similar in size, i would know if i opened the bag, the chub really stink ! the guy that had the cooler never mentioned the herring fish ? he said they were caught in lake huron, he smoked them himself."
1036522,DanD,2018-11-15 16:20:00,2223,These Loblaws ones might also be salt water fish? They don't have a very strong smell? But like you said they go down great with an ice cold beer. LOL  Dan.
1036523,muskybw,2018-11-15 16:21:00,116,"SPIEL thanks--i just googled, where 2 buy smoked chub in ontario, no hits ? wisconsin usa. only spot ?"
1036524,AKRISONER,2018-11-15 16:33:00,5558,"lmao im just here cause the inuendo is dang killing me. A quick check on the conservation status of the fish you are talking about would explain why its most likely totally outlawed for commercial fishing...the fish is listed as a species vulnerable to global extinction. with populations collapsing in all areas that it is found. Alewife predation, sea lamprey and pollution ""smoked"" the whole population. Hopefully with the total collapse of the alewife and sea lamprey population in Huron the species can make a come back. Although, if you fish parry sound for lakers...they are munchin on alewife still so i dont know how well it holds up."
1036527,DRIFTER_016,2018-11-15 16:49:00,10439,We dipnet ciscoes in the late fall in the Yellowknife river up here.  
1036528,AKRISONER,2018-11-15 16:52:00,5558,that looks like some absolutely killer salmon bait
1036529,DRIFTER_016,2018-11-15 17:08:00,10439,Works good for pike and lakers too.
1036530,misfish,2018-11-15 17:10:00,29133,"Here I was all giddy that I was going to try something new in the smoker. Smoked chub. Now that I think of it, the ones in the spring might be worth a try."
1036531,muskybw,2018-11-15 18:02:00,116,"thanks DRIFTER-016---boy,brings back memories at denny's dam. the fella opened-up his cooler just like yours, filled with smoked lake huron chubs !  they are high in omega 3 fatty acids, more than sockeye salmon, greasy & wonderful to smoke, that's why they must stink sooo bad. lake huron & michigan don't have very many of them, zebra mussels eating their food source on the bottom ( plankton)- maybe ? ---read some google post."
1036532,Spiel,2018-11-15 18:07:00,9065,Same results I had.
1036535,Tom S,2018-11-15 20:15:00,362,"Where do you live? Might try to find a nearby Starskys or european deli. They'll usually have some smoked fish in stock, or will be bringing it in for the upcoming holiday season."
1036536,Fisherman,2018-11-15 20:21:00,7201,St Lawrence market has just about everything.
1036537,misfish,2018-11-15 20:24:00,29133,"Yup and Brants meat factory Both are with,n minutes of each other on Dundas."
1036538,SirCranksalot,2018-11-15 21:11:00,3291,So do they call you the Ciscoe Kid????
1036541,muskybw,2018-11-15 21:37:00,116,"TOM S & FISHERMAN---thanks for the info. you do not want these smoked fish in your house with women & children ! THEY STINK BAD !  there has to be somebody else on this message board that has eaten lake huron smoked chubs, that will tell you they have to be eaten outdoors ? they are tasty, but they stink ?"
1036544,Cast-Away,2018-11-15 21:52:00,790,"Interesting title to this thread ""smoked chub"", it could mean many different things! ?"
1036547,misfish,2018-11-15 22:27:00,29133,"Ok, smoked herring, chub what ever you want to call it, aint that smelly. Try smoking just out the front door of your condo. Now that smells,,,,,,,,,,   WONDERFUL."
