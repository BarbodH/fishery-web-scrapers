The individual numbers are not as important as what they mean in combination with each other. Think of it as an electrocardiogram the scribbles mean nothing as a scribble but by comparing and looking at all of them it tells you if things are meshing correctly. If there was any concern the mechanic would have been happy to explain how it was going to cost you more money. Art
