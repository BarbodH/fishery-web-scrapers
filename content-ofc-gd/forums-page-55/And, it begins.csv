1036512,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-15 15:21:00,8243,"Yea, a funny thing happens in the country every winter. And each and every year many are surprised. We have a family in town that are hosting refugees from Africa. We got a dusting Tuesday and they were flipping out. Never saw snow first hand in their lives."
1036539,SirCranksalot,2018-11-15 21:15:00,3291,Yup---be esp careful of any back and forth rhythmic motions on that LUV seat!!
1036546,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-15 22:16:00,8243,"I went out today. I stopped counting the cars in the ditches. 2 in the same ditch. Less than an inch of snow. It was slick though. I had to put her in 4 wheel. I almost joined them and locked up a few times through a stop and put the front wheels through the shoulder onto the grass turning,,,, too fast."
1036551,Fisherman,2018-11-16 00:02:00,7201,"Hahaha,  speed isn't at fault, lack of friction will put you into the rhubarb every time."
1036709,David Chong,2018-11-19 20:38:00,836,We don't need the snow just cold temps and no wind so we can make some solid ice! Snow just makes people forget how to drive!
1036459,misfish,2018-11-14 13:15:00,29133,Sure is pretty out side.    
1036460,Terry,2018-11-14 13:32:00,14456,Yup lots of snow

1036467,grimsbylander,2018-11-14 15:46:00,3016,They should just officially change the city's name to Barried. lol
1036470,Fisherman,2018-11-14 16:15:00,7201,"#*+@% snow,  I looked at the shovel and without touching it my back started twitching.  Not enough for the blower, thank god it's fluffy and light.  As much as I'm not a fan of them,  I may have to resort to a small plow for the ATV.  Barrie renamed to Burried,  Angus to Anguish, or just pull the ""G"" and yu know."
1036472,misfish,2018-11-14 16:20:00,29133,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So no more grass back ground for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, LOL"

1036485,irishfield,2018-11-14 19:07:00,26272,"Be a bugger getting it in Kelvin, this is as high as the little Kubota would lift it so I could move it to where the Boss wanted it. .. and that was by cheating and lifting it, then putting the hoe out full to use as a weighted lever to lift the front up a bit. Still snowing here!!!! Where's that sunshine they promised for 1PM ?? "
