1036056,John Bacon,2018-11-05 01:17:00,3277,"I have a Mercury branded Tohotsu 5hp sail pro kicker motor.  I tried to change the lower end oil today.  Unfortunately, it uses smaller ports than my 50hp Merc, so I cannot use my oil pump to fill it back up.  	Has anyone else run into this issue?  Do you know anyone who carries; either an adapter for a standard oil pump, or a smaller sized pump for these outboards?"
1036058,OhioFisherman,2018-11-05 01:32:00,6623,"John, this pump mentions an adapter,and comes with one? No idea if the walmarts up there carry them, the ones here are pretty good about ordering things though. https://www.walmart.com/ip/Shoreline-Marine-Lower-Unit-Lube-Pump/35259578"

1036061,irishfield,2018-11-05 02:24:00,26272,"I've found that the tips you get with a tube of RTV sealant will thread onto one of the threaded adapters that came with the cheap pump and I use those on one of my engines. Just clip it to the correct ""step"" diameter to work. On another engine I use a tip from a tube of hemorrhoid cream."
1036062,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-05 02:31:00,8243,I also got an adapter for my smaller Mariner 15HP(Merc built) from Proctors in Simcoe. The problem I have is the tube is too short to get all the gear lube out.
1036069,DanD,2018-11-05 11:53:00,2223,Turkey baster. If one squirt isn't enough; put your finger over the check plug hole. Very little oil will come out of the fill hole. Recharge the baster and repeat as needed. Dan.
1036071,Fisherman,2018-11-05 13:27:00,7201,Well I sure hope it's a one product use otherwise the next ones getting a shot of Brokeback Mountain 80W90 marine loob up the hoop.
1036112,porkpie,2018-11-05 22:42:00,2521,Most marinas carry adapters for about $8.  I bought one for my oil pump.  My kicker also has a much smaller port than the big motor. Only made sense.
1036113,Terry,2018-11-05 22:44:00,14456,I didn’t think most guys would admit to having undersized lower end ports LOL sorry.
1036127,John Bacon,2018-11-06 01:46:00,3277,"Thanks for your help, I was able to pick up an adapter today."
1036136,John Bacon,2018-11-06 06:02:00,3277,"Well, the issue is that my tool was too large for the hole.  I had to find someone with a smaller tool...  ?"
