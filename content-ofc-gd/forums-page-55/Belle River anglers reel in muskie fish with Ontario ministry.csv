1035992,Mike Pike,2018-11-02 18:21:00,1332,Anyone else find the fact that Muskies have been found to travel from Lake St. Clair to Buffalo Harbour absolutely amazing???  Wow!!!
1036109,b_cdot,2018-11-05 22:24:00,270,"Could be a rumour, but one of the fellas who runs musky charters out of LSC said there was one recently tagged in the past few years in LSC and was caught in the Welland canal a year later. Never would have thought they were so nomadic. Obviously Mike Pike has heard similar tales."
