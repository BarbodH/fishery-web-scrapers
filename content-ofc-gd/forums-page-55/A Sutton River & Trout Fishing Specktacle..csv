1034204,Moosebunk,2018-09-19 13:44:00,3970,"OK... I won't send this reply to your boss.  Appreciate you reading the story but please put your job first in the future.  lol You should take the trip in your dad's honor is what you should do.  Back to your roots.  It's the perfect place to think on that. There's only a handful of friends I could consider doing this kind of trip with.  The older we all get, the more set in our ways we tend to be so if you have friends that you are struggling with on short trips now, chances are you will continue to unless you begin talking about it soon.  My temperament and drive isn't for everyone, and I know this.  So with some friends I am quick and honest to explain that I don't think we would work together well for this or that type of thing.  If they are really your friends, they may or may not like it but, they will ultimately understand and accept that.  Friends I think the world of don't necessarily have the right stuff for certain trips.  And that's not usually a fault of theirs or mine, but more or less just our differences and, my beliefs of how we will manage together on any given trip.  Mike is one guy who puts on his big boy pants, gets his hands dirty, never stops thinking, and in the face of troubled moments usually takes a time out to collect himself.  I'm much the same except I tend to explode for a brief moment when troubled, then it's out and I can chill.  It's never an easy thing though, I have some friends now who likely be ticked off with me for life because I took this trip without them.  To that I say, book yourself the trip and go then. As far as fly fishing goes, I truly was just in awe of it again, maybe more so than ever before.  IMO it's just not productive enough for certain fishing I like, ie; muskie, lakers, walleye, sturgeon, and others.  That said, trips for specks and pike, maybe more gar at home too, I hope to step up the fly game a little bit more.  It is, as you know, a very rewarding to hook up. http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/woods-expedition-comfort-max-self-inflating-mattress-4-in-0762919p.html#srp This thing was a bit bulky but AMAZING to sleep on.  Bought it and a single tent that the mattress just fits inside.  The whole thing can be set up on the casting deck of my boat.  Get just as good a night sleep on it as I do the bed at home.  Maybe better with all that fresh O2 passing the nares. You'll like it I think! You like the northern O trip reports."
1034212,ehg,2018-09-19 17:22:00,2666,"Took a long time to read (SPMS, optic neuritis), thanks for effort in writing. Too much to mention, all excellent. Liked the pop culture allusions (fat bottomed gulls, and then there were six) What a great experience .Polar foam bears. HaHa!  Read the whole thing.  Thanks!"
1034332,Moosebunk,2018-09-21 14:27:00,3970,"Good to hear from ya mon chum!  Would be nicer to hear of better health though. Didn't even think of ""then there were six"" in reference, you got me looking online now. lol... Fat bottomed gulls, yeah, that was one for sure. Polar Foam...???  Just an idiot here really. What a dumb play that was. lol Be well bud. Feel good."
1036415,Out4Trout,2018-11-13 04:11:00,98,Drew!! Awesome read - and the pictures are amazing. Hats off to you and Mike... thanks for sharing this trip / report with us. Len
1036617,Moosebunk,2018-11-17 02:37:00,3970,"Thanks Len... and good to hear from you. Trust you're getting ready for a long ice season now, unless any hunts haven't finished..? Maybe catch ya out there sometime for lakers granted I get out much at all."
1033995,Moosebunk,2018-09-14 04:14:00,3970,"The famous Sutton River and its speckled trout fishing!!!  Writing stories online now for more than 15 years, this is the one which should have been the first.  Learning of this remote, northern Ontario river back in 2000 while living in nearby Attawapiskat, since then it has been the longest standing fishing trip on my bucketlist.  Flying in August to our starting point at Hawley Lake, my good friend Mike and I camped and paddled our way out along the Sutton to Polar Bear Provincial Park and finally, Hudson Bay.  An experience completely out of this world, for 130 kilometers over 12 days, hundreds and hundreds of speckled trout were caught on lures and flies.  Fishing the Sutton is truly unimaginable, just a very special waterway choked with trout for it’s entire length.  If you are ever going to take a journey with me or maybe plan to one day travel to the Sutton yourself, this is a story you should read.  Full, picture loaded report at the link below.  So get in the canoe and trust me. A SUTTON RIVER & TROUT FISHING SPECKTACLE      Thanks for reading... Bunk."
1034010,the spirit of fishing,2018-09-14 15:16:00,141,WOW! Awesome write up. Can't thank you enough for sharing.
1034036,ckewley,2018-09-15 13:47:00,699,"One word describes that whole truly awesome report, TOTALLY VASCULAR!!! man that was a epic read, thanks!!!!! If you don't mind could you clue me in on the cost, PM if necessary. The Sutton has been a bucketlist place for me since first reading Borgers report years ago."
1034037,BillM,2018-09-15 13:52:00,17367,"I'm guessing the price is close to 3k PP just for the fly in these days.   When I went a few years ago it was $2500. Great read Drew, brings back a lot of memories.   Looks like the water was up, making for easy paddling and no portaging over those shallow gravel beds (Which held some insane fish for us) I'd think the prices would be on the Hearst Air website as well."
1034075,Moosebunk,2018-09-16 12:31:00,3970,Thank you sir!  Tougher crowd here nowadays but happy you took the time to read and enjoy. Probably one of the most time consuming stories to write but it had to be written. Mike and I will look back on it for years to come. 
1034076,Moosebunk,2018-09-16 12:53:00,3970,"The wife’s darned IPad is giving me troubles here.  We tried to stay away from “epic” you know!?! ? Been done to death.? Thanks for reading, it is a pricey spot, been eying it for years and dont think I remember it being $2500 but maybe? They’re package (flight and canoe) is $3200."
1034077,Moosebunk,2018-09-16 12:56:00,3970,"OFC or the wifes IPad are fudged up! I’ll have to get back to you Bill. gotta go fishinghere, already late"
1034086,chris.brock,2018-09-16 22:19:00,4053,"I think my brain is fudged up after seeing and reading about all those beautiful brookies. I think the word ""epic"" is definitely warranted. That's an epic adventure Bunk!"
1034087,misfish,2018-09-16 22:27:00,29133,"It,s the site Drew. Been funky for awhile now.  Those were some amazing fish. Another sweet report as always."
1034090,grimsbylander,2018-09-17 00:28:00,3016,"What a write up! I'm only half way through it and have to come back to finish when I have more time. I couldn't help but skim through all the photos though. Just my opinion here but I can't look at the beauty that's ""painted"" on those fish, the trees, streams, and even the polished rocks and blue sky, and not believe in a higher power. That's a stunning part of the world. Thanks again for taking us there!"
1034092,akaShag,2018-09-17 01:05:00,2073,"I commented already over on your blog but wanted to tag this for interest here as well. I am just back from a fly-in myself, think I should have gone to the Sutton instead.................? And I still think the first round should be double ought buck to the head, and the next two the slugs.  But I hope not to have to find out. Thanks for writing, bud, you sure as hell have a gift for it. Doug"
1034096,Moosebunk,2018-09-17 03:49:00,3970,"Between Albert's first and new second cabin we were walking and scraping the canoe down river. That day we only had to go about 4K and we were both thinking that the canoe was going to take a beating if it kept up like that.  Albert had told us that any rain they had been getting was being soaked up like a sponge by the ground, the river had been coming up.  UNTIL those 2-3 days when we held up in the cabin.  After that finished, the river still only came up about 2 maybe 3 inches I'd guess but, it was perfect enough to keep us from having to walk until sometime during the day we finally reached the Aquatuk.  Don't think it could have been more perfect a level.  Was going to ask you though, if you use the maps were there any spots on there you remember as being really good to you? OK CB!!! Epic it'll be. Bren and I were away the weekend. OFC wouldn't work with my phone so I tried her IPad. Took me well over a half hour just to finish a couple responses.  Thanks Brian! Always found the sunsets and horizons extra big on the James Bay.... Hudson Bay too I guess.  That river is made of something different... made just for brook trout that's for sure.  Thanks for reading Grim! Where did ya go bud?  Skip a hunt and come out for a fish this week, even if just a muskie troll on the Larry.  Polar Bear Prov Park permits only shotguns with slugs for protection in the park.  I liked your idea to Doug, but some folks north and south hunters just kinda chuckled about even having the shotgun at all.  They said, ""you should have a rifle.""  Guessing shotgun isn't good enough?  Anyways, you did see the size of that paw print?  JEEEEZUS MAN!!!  Thanks again for your help and kindness with things, you're one good dood!"
1034098,akaShag,2018-09-17 13:21:00,2073,"I own a LOT of rifles, including some heavy thumpers, and have shot just about every cartridge for which rifles have been chambered for over a century.  That includes some ""elephant guns.""  If I was going to carry a gun for bear defence, I would go with the 12 gauge shotgun.  A buddy of mine, who lived in Yellowknife at the time, also had a choice of multiple firearms when he was in the back country.  He carried a 12 gauge shotgun for bear defence.  As they say, JMOYMV, and the best gun to use is the one you have with you at the time! But this thread is about a SPECKtacular fishing trip, not a polar bear hunt, so I hope not to de-rail it......... I'll send you an e-mail. Doug "
1034105,BillM,2018-09-17 15:53:00,17367,"I have tracks/waypoints from our trip.   We started fishing south of where the Warchesku enters the Sutton, saw fish as soon as we entered the river, it was pretty crazy.   Caught fish as soon as we got out of the boat.  According to Albert it was a high water year and honestly I wouldn't have wanted to fish it any lower, it was perfect.  Didn't have to get out of the boat once to get over any gravel and it made some of those long gravel stretches downstream some of the best water we fished.    I'll have to dig into MapSource but some of our best fishing on those long gravel stretches were above the Aquatuk.    We zipped through the 'Freezer hole', that's the big bend pool just DS of where Albert has his tent.  We only fished the tailout as there were two old boys already there, I really didn't feel like sharing water with anyone, lol. I'm still pissed I pulled the 12g instead of the camera when we encountered that polar bear at the Aquatuk.    Pictures would have been unreal, lol.    I'd love to get back, but I really wanna knock the big brother Arctic char off my bucketlist before that"
1034107,akaShag,2018-09-17 16:00:00,2073,"I'm still pissed I pulled the 12g instead of the camera when we encountered that polar bear at the Aquatuk.    Pictures would have been unreal, lol. ............and the last photos on the SD card might have been of a set of polar bear teeth..............."
1034115,BillM,2018-09-17 17:43:00,17367,"The bear didn't even flinch when I fired off 3 rounds into the air.    It entered the water upstream of us and swam downstream and towards us, probably popped out of the water about 50ft away.  Shook off, looked and just walked up the bank and into the trees.   Zero interest in us."
1034122,Sterling,2018-09-17 18:30:00,477,"Nice one Bunk. I'm about half way through. ""the only real thing missing were soft, beautiful and horny women."" This and the picture of the log got me in stitches! You sir, will be on your deathbed with no regrets!"
1034124,akaShag,2018-09-17 19:00:00,2073,"Yeah, and I was trying to put a roll eyes emoji on my comment so you could see I wasn't serious.  But the forum froze up and wouldn't give me the emojis........"
1034129,BillM,2018-09-17 20:07:00,17367,"Although, a bear meal was a definitely possibility"
1034140,Moosebunk,2018-09-17 22:56:00,3970,"The ""Freezer"" is now called the ""Breakfast"" pool maybe? Basically a 2 second walk from Alberts?  A fly angler was on it a couple days but when he and Albert slipped down river one afternoon, we got in there and pounded fish in that tailout.  Didn't swing the flies much there as that's all the other guy had been doing, but he sure left alot of fish lure hungry.  Above the Aquatuk where those skinny runs were we moved through at a quick pace and didn't bother. Finally drift fished in a good mile or two before stopping at Eerie Feelings above the Aquatuk.  Put a quick and decent hurt on some fish there.  It's interesting to note how others like to fish the river, there's certainly no shortage of trout for all styles. And thanks Sterling. lol.  Mike had me laughing with that log too. Nut!  GOD we could have used some horny bush broads out there though. What happens on the Sutton... well, it doesn't stay on the Sutton and it sure would have added a little extra to the story."
1034142,Jds63,2018-09-18 00:37:00,1365,"Amazing report Drew !!!! love your writing style ... started reading it on my lunch , couldn’t stop so went home and took the afternoon off to finish it in peace ... lol My dad used to take me out to the local creeks many many years ago and we would catch small specks . Wish we could have done a trip like that when he was younger before he passed. Your story telling is always fun to read...  "
1034146,AKRISONER,2018-09-18 15:39:00,5558,"ahaha that shot with the piece of wood is amazing. Funny bunk you guys are going through a much heavier ordeal than i do with the boys when we head out on a weekend fishing trip, but it seems like too much time in the boat with anyone is enough to ruffle feathers. I couldnt imagine trying to do it while eating fish every day 2 meals a day lol. What a report, glad i got to read it in one sitting. When you described how fly fishing is like a whole other element, that really hit home for me...i dont think its something people understand until they do it."
1034147,BillM,2018-09-18 16:55:00,17367,"Yeah, I think that's the best part about that river.  Doesn't matter how you fish for them, you'll catch them.    After the first few hours, I basically tossed top water mouse patterns the rest of the trip.   Although a spinning setup would have been a lot less tiring"
1034151,pics,2018-09-18 18:29:00,1268,I haven't read it yet but it looks to be a dandy... One quiet morning with a coffee in hand I will read it..
