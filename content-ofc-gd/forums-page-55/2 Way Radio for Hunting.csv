1036640,guastels,2018-11-17 14:07:00,22,After a frustrating hunting week with my cheap two radio I decided to invest into a good one.  I have looked into reviews and curious if anyone can make any recommendations on a good waterproof 2 Way Radio. Thanks!

1036642,spincast,2018-11-17 14:24:00,3279,"if you only need it for a short season, why not rent a commercial grade one / set? A quick google search pulled up this site? https://www.ctmmobile.com/2-way-radio-rental-ontario.html  "

1036674,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-18 14:13:00,8243,"We used the Peltor brand radios at the plant for years and they could withstand the heat and abuse of  Blast Furnace operations. They could be hooked up where an attachment went around your neck and it could be hands free voice activated. They were good for a few kms. and that is in an environment with massive amounts of steel structure between you and the other guy. The speakers were in the hearing protection ear muffs, so hands free with the voice activation  could be an advantage hunting or one can use the hand held remote option to key the mic. I know we were always missing more than a few pair around hunting season. I know they weren't cheap in price or quality. peltorcomms.3m.com"
