1036171,Spiel,2018-11-06 20:13:00,9065,Sharing a little of what I've been up to lately and daily. Lots of rod work when I'm not cooking. 	These two builds showing reel seat to grip designs created by me were recently featured on CTS' FB page.          
1036172,Tom S,2018-11-06 20:17:00,362,"Nice. Really like that top one, beautiful grain with the matching reel seat, grip accents, and reel handles. Doesn't get any better than that."
1036173,Spiel,2018-11-06 20:18:00,9065,"Thanks Tom  	The top one is for a friend who made the reel. He chose the wood based on the acrylic he had previously bought, Great match."
1036174,DanD,2018-11-06 20:24:00,2223,There's no doubt these are very functional; but as nice as they are; for me they'd be wall hangers. Way to nice to use!!!!!  Dan.
1036175,jimmer,2018-11-06 20:28:00,2730,Very nice!
1036177,misfish,2018-11-06 20:59:00,29133,"HMMM Where did I put that coupon ?  Nice work, and the last build pic is sweet.  Is there much different in the new CTS blanks then the one you built for me Chris? Kinda regretting letting mine go to the son, but I know he really likes it."
1036180,spincast,2018-11-06 23:04:00,3279,wow - those are fantastic. nice workmanship all around
1036201,Spiel,2018-11-07 15:32:00,9065,"LOL  	Thanks Brian, nope still much the same blank."
1036203,Jds63,2018-11-07 18:19:00,1365,beautiful work  !!!!
1036206,AKRISONER,2018-11-07 20:20:00,5558,"man, too clean!!!! that reel handle combo is ridiculous."
1036210,Shloim,2018-11-07 20:41:00,515,Sounds to me like reason enough to get a new one.... 
1036213,misfish,2018-11-07 21:12:00,29133," My SST 3 would look sweet on it. It,s been sitting new for a few years now. LOL"
1036216,BillM,2018-11-08 00:41:00,17367,"Beauty work as always man.   If I find a tip section for one of my Loomis IM6s, I'll have to send it over for some TLC."
1036217,OhioFisherman,2018-11-08 01:44:00,6623,Beautiful work! Is that reel carbon fiber or just black metal?
1036225,Spiel,2018-11-08 13:52:00,9065,It is matte black anodized aluminium.
1036226,Lape0019,2018-11-08 14:55:00,647,Not my type of rod but I can most definitely see the craftsmanship and the beauty of great workmanship.  Great work!
