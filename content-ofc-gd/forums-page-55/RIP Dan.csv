1036834,NAW,2018-11-21 17:08:00,4022,Thanks for posting this Brian.  I used to see him downtown Barrie a few times.  He was in a pretty bad state of mind in his later years.  I hope he's in a better place now.  He kept trying to knock out nurses and PSW's at the RVH Hospital where my GF works.  Everyone was terrified of getting caught with one of his punches.   He sure could do some serious damage.
