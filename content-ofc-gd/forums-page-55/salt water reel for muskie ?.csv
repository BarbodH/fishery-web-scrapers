1036259,muskybw,2018-11-09 15:22:00,116,"GARNET--it's fun 2 watch on u-tube, i'm 2 old & 35 yrs. later as a brewery worker, hasn't paid off in the strength department ? i have quit fishing wide open st. clair, and have  just started fishing the HALIBURTON lakes for muskie, i have a sister on a small lake behind EAGLE LAKE with a cottage. there is some nice muskie lakes in west guilford county & head lake in haliburton. i will keep watching on u-tube what you are doing. ( hard work. )"
1036260,muskybw,2018-11-09 15:32:00,116,"BILLM--- i looked up the TRANX 500, bait caster & holy cow $ 600 bucks, made of gold ! it should be SMOOTH."
1036262,Garnet,2018-11-09 18:22:00,2056,I started this stuff at about 53 and tried to just use my bass stuff. That lasted about 1.5 days and I was buying the right stuff. At 61 now I really pick my spots . It's really funny seeing 70-80 year olds riding up and down canal. There's a cottage industry producing these wooden plugs. Cape Cod is 1 hr to Boston north and 1 hr southto NY City summer rental  rates are just  wild we go after labour day and June is best fishing.
1036263,BillM,2018-11-09 18:30:00,17367,That sounds like a lot of fun!
1036264,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-09 19:59:00,8243,Sounds like an adventure and a blast. It's been many years since I've been to Cape Cod. Going tp Provincetown was like being beamed to a different planet.
1036265,muskybw,2018-11-09 20:00:00,116,BILLM and GARNET ---it looks & sounds like a lot of fun-----30 yrs. ago.  lol.
1036269,adempsey,2018-11-09 22:45:00,1498,"There are a number of spinning reels with gear rations < 5.0 that should work.  I put together this list for pike fishing, but some of it is just as relevant for musky. https://www.canadafishingguide.net/targeting-trophy-pike-on-a-fly-in-trip-dedicated-rod-reel-setups/ You can download a full list of reels at the bottom of the article."
1036271,muskybw,2018-11-10 00:19:00,116,"ADEMPSEY ---thanks a lot, what a share of valuable information, in that canadafishingguide.net ! WOW EE TIMBER TOM. i will read that at least 3 more times, i don't have a printer on my notebook. i have had one musky shy of 54 in. &  one 54 in., 33 & 35 lbs. out of st.clair landed in the boat, a good friend & my nephew landed them, but some those PIKE PICS are absolutely huge ! the only fish i've seen bigger than those pike are muskies from  eagle lake in dryden, scott jeager north shore lodge, check out his muskie gallery ?  thanks again.     "
1036275,muskybw,2018-11-10 02:14:00,116,"ADEMPSEY---i went to the CANADA FISHING GUIDE website, i've never seen freshwater fish that big ? PIKE-WOW  !  when i win a lottery and become rich & famous, i will be back. cheers."
1036278,Garnet,2018-11-10 13:07:00,2056,Ahhh Province Town my wife loves to shopping and just like Iron I get educated on different life styles. Cape Cod 10 hr drive the fishing is just a blast. We will be going back .
1036308,Canuck,2018-11-11 00:36:00,491,Daiwa BG is a fantastic saltwater reel.  Read the online reviews.  I have a 2500 and its really nice.  Great drag and smooth.  I would think one of the big ones would be strong enough for big pike or musky.  They use them for casting big plugs and baits in saltwater.  But using a spinning reel with braid casting all day is hard on the fingers compared to a bait caster.  With gloves it might be easier.
1036320,muskybw,2018-11-11 02:05:00,116,"thanks CANUCK, i'm now looking at the BG 4000 OR 4500 ? not going to use it on st.clair, stick with the bait casters. i'm going to use on my new passion, the lakes up in HALIBURTON. the fish are not as big as st.clair, but it's GOD COUNTRY on the lakes in HALIBURTON. i've fished 3 lakes since the middle of sept., the biggest ski was 40 in., my brother-in-law bagged it, on an eight inch, wooden baby carp on head lake. the other 2 lakes we were getting ski's between 3 & 10 lbs., they were after 6 in. baits. it is a lot of fun in the HALIBURTON HIGHLANDS !"
1036184,muskybw,2018-11-06 23:52:00,116,"hello everyone---has anyone one out there used a daiwa BG-4000sw spinning reel for muskie hunting ? they hold a lot of heavy-duty line & a great drag system. i have 2 bait casters, i watched a u-tube video with a guy fighting & landing a 50 lb. tarpon with this spinning reel . i might buy one ???"
1036185,kickingfrog,2018-11-07 00:09:00,8333,"A well built saltwater reel would handle a muskie fight with zero issues. Many 15-20lb saltwater fish fight harder and longer than any muskie that's ever swum, not even close. However that reel might not stand up to long term casting and reeling of the large muskie baits that are often used now. The salt water reel is also likely geared for fast lure retrieves that are needed for saltwater and that would work against you as well."
1036186,Garnet,2018-11-07 00:09:00,2056,I have 5500 penn 5500 Shimano Ultere and Shimano 5500 baitrunner salt water spinning. Tried fishing Salmon at mouth of Ganny with Penn and my middle salt rod 9ft. I could bounce those salmon across the surface and land them in 15 seconds. Was that much fun.
1036187,muskybw,2018-11-07 00:23:00,116,"thanks GARNET,  how would they stand-up to a 25 lb. muskie on lake st.clair ? would they handle a big muskie on open water ?"
1036189,Rizzo,2018-11-07 01:52:00,4754,I have a buddy who has caught lots of muskies on st clair on a spinning reel...we troll with it...only issue is it has no clicker so you have to pay attention to that one!
1036190,muskybw,2018-11-07 02:05:00,116,"thanks RIZZO, i'll be checking out amazon for price ?"
1036194,muskybw,2018-11-07 11:13:00,116,"kicking frog, thanks. you got me thinking now, you make some great points."
1036195,Garnet,2018-11-07 11:49:00,2056,My 5500 stuff is used for Stripe Bass fishing. They fight much like musky but stronger. Think my 5500 would be over kill and you likely will be the crash tester on the 4000.
1036196,muskybw,2018-11-07 13:25:00,116,"thanks GARNET, good info, likely stick with my bait casters."
1036197,BillM,2018-11-07 14:04:00,17367,"It will handle the fight, but the baits?  That's going to be the problem unless you're tossing the smaller sized stuff."
1036198,muskybw,2018-11-07 14:46:00,116,thanks BILLM----i'm starting to get the full picture.
1036199,Garnet,2018-11-07 14:56:00,2056,Guppy pensil poppers is what I throw most for Stripers. 3 oz wooden plug. Look them up perfect musky size.
1036204,muskybw,2018-11-07 18:38:00,116,"thanks, i will google them."
1036231,J Roelofsen,2018-11-08 15:46:00,84,The Okuma Ceymar 65 is a big solid spinning reel that will work for musky. I have one strapped to a Ceymar inshore rod as a lender for anyone that's out musky hunting with me and is unfamiliar with casting reels. It's spooled up with 65lb braid. Makes a decent combo for under $200 and will handle big stuff pretty well!  Josh
1036239,muskybw,2018-11-08 18:50:00,116,"thanks JOSH, that reel would look a lot better on my okuma big nasty supercast beach rod than the ambassador abu garcia C-3 that i have on it ? can't beat the price on that combo."
1036240,lew,2018-11-08 19:25:00,12766,That Abu C-3 makes a pretty good basic no-frills musky reel and you can use it for both casting & trolling.
1036242,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-08 21:34:00,8243,"I picked up 2 big Shimano saltwater spinning reels at a tackle swap in Pt, Charlotte Fla years ago. I don't fish for Musky but I use them trolling on Erie for Pics and Salmon. The only drawback is no line counters but no problem whatsoever dragging in 10 pound farm animals. If they can handle big old Grouper and Rays a Musky wouldn't be a problem with a good quality Offshore Saltwater spinning reel."
1036243,Old Ironmaker,2018-11-08 21:36:00,8243,
1036247,muskybw,2018-11-09 00:10:00,116,"hey LOU,  the c-3 works fine for me on that big nasty beach rod. the only thing is i'm 67 & throwing big m-baits on the heavy rod does me in before lunch. the afternoon is a daiwa 1300 ss on a 9 ft. loomis blank fishing walleyes ?"
1036248,muskybw,2018-11-09 00:22:00,116,"thanks old ironmaker,  i watched a couple of u-tube videos on the cape cod canal, using guppy pencil poppers with huge shimano spinning reels & big surf rods, fishing for stripers & blues. they were casting a mile with 40 lb. test. like casting in wide-open st.clair."
1036249,Garnet,2018-11-09 00:33:00,2056,Cape Cod canal is where I fish. Wicked tide. The standard are 11-12 rods. I tried a bunch and settled on a 10 St Croix with the Shimano Ultera 5500. It's beast of a stick. There's a diawa  spinning reel you can dial 35 lbs of drag and fish Bluefin tuna. Wicked Tuna style.
1036252,BillM,2018-11-09 05:27:00,17367,"You'll want a big rod, 9ft + and a nice Tranx 500.   You'll last a lot longer with that setup I'm sure"
1036254,muskybw,2018-11-09 11:24:00,116,"thanks BILLM, i have two 9 ft. heavy action rods with bait casters. i'm checking the spinning reel market, will look up the tranx 500. cheers."
1036255,muskybw,2018-11-09 11:34:00,116,"GARNET----i watched a u-tube on the canal, i guy my age under a highway bridge, throwing out those pencil poppers into the current, wiggling the tip of the rod & reeling slow with the 10 ft. rod.  what action with those guppy pencil poppers !"
1036257,Garnet,2018-11-09 14:11:00,2056,"I haven't been to Cape Cod for 2 years. Our last trip I was fishing the eastern gap. Jetty like Bowmanville rocks throwing that pencil mid day sunny, I see a striper from about 40 ft away coming . It plastid my pencil about 3 ft in the air. Took off on about a 50 ft circle and just hammered my plug. About 30lb. I need to get in shape throwing this stuff  every 3-4 cast take little break by the end of the 2 week I might be up to 10 cast. Got into a blitz on a beach have no idea how many I caught stripers up to 40 lbs. Google Canal Bikes either side of the ditch has a walking/bicycle path guys ride up and down rod holders, baskets. I had one for a couple trips didn't really work for me. And the most fun trying to figure out tides no matter what you do today it will be different tomorrow. My other bait is a 3 oz white bucktail with a strait tail trailer. This type of equipment would be to much for musky."
