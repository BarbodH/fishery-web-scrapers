288436,Headhunter,2009-01-06 15:53:00,5703,"Hey folks, I have recently joined a band and as a result, I am learning to play many tunes, old and new. I really don't want to buy CD's for just one song, so I was hoping for some suggestions as to what sites you use to down load music. I have given Lime Wire a go and frankly, if I wanted to down load Porn, I'd go to a porn site!!!! Hoping you folks can help me out! Thanks in advance! HH"
288437,Raf,2009-01-06 15:55:00,3495,"limewire is still a good choice for onesies and twoosies.  if you are interested in complete albums look for a torrent site  to avoid fakes on limewire, look for a value in the bitrate column when searching for mp3s."
288447,Fang,2009-01-06 16:27:00,1330,"You Tube has all the song videos you'll ever need, type in band and/or song name and you'll get a ton of choices. That's what I use. Pick up the song chords from chordie or one of the other tab sites and play along with the vidoe on You Tube  There's download patches so you can store the video on your hard drive and play later. Don't ask me how, that's were my kid comes in. They know more than I."
288450,Headhunter,2009-01-06 16:34:00,5703,"Thanks Raf and Fang... I'm aware of Youtube, however in an effort to more quickly learn the songs, I like to listen to them on my MP3 player on the Go Train, to become more ""imtimate"" with the song. And watching someone else play the part on Youtube is ""cheating"", as far as I'm concerned! LOL I guess I'm old school, having spent a good part of my youth learning songs for the record and continually moving that stylus back and forth! HH"
288454,ccmtcanada,2009-01-06 16:54:00,7971,Hey HH....  I use Limewire for all the tunes my band plays...just set your search criteria to return mp3s only...that should filter out a lot of the garbage...
288455,Rich,2009-01-06 16:56:00,3927,"Try Ares Lite instead of Limewire. Works better for me, no fakes no viruses no spyware"
288477,Scott S,2009-01-06 17:56:00,203,U Torrent is my choice. You can pick from several site's from here and almost any song you want. Scooter

288489,Headhunter,2009-01-06 18:22:00,5703,"Thanks folks, much appreciated! Wayne, I will not be paying for a blanket in ""Hallebuttocks"" this time around! Not doing it for a living (LMAO), just for the fun of it and to get out of the house from time to time... HH"

288603,kemper,2009-01-06 22:27:00,2232,"btjunkie.org and use a bit torrent downloader if your internet is fast its a beauty plus you can get the full albums with the covers too.  I use frostwire for ones and twos, its faster and less crap than limewire"

288914,maybe,2009-01-07 14:39:00,307,"You'd be surprised how often Limewire is front and center on systems that hit my bench with massive virus/trojan infestations.  Moreso than other file sharing apps.  Like everything else, I'm sure there are 4 people who use it without problems - but I wouldn't go near it.  uTorrent is a nice P2P program - stable, clean, easy to deal with.  You'll want to use Mininova or Torrentz as a search engine.  Bear in mind that if the torrent is for an entire album (or discography), 9 times out of 10 you have the option to uncheck the songs you don't want before the files start downloading.  This happens between when you click the ""download the torrent"" link, and when you hit ""go"" in uTorrent.  If you have a membership with a premium usenet service like Giganews, you can use Binsearch to search for files.  It's awkward and kludgy, but download speeds are usually faster than P2P.  Tick off the file you want in the search result, Binsearch will make an nzb file for you.  Open the nzb file in something like Newsbin Pro, and it'll allow you to download the files you selected.  Now, if you're doing the torrent/usenet thing, it goes without saying that you'll only be downloading files that are the original work of the uploader, and are being offered with no copyright or other restrictions.  Right?  MuchMusic has an online music store that offers files in wma and mp3 format.  Doublecheck you're getting the format you want before you hit that download button.  I accidentally wound up with useless wma copies of the latest Serena Ryder tracks, had to pay for them twice to get mp3s.     Worth it, though - Little Bit of Red is incredible."
288915,Gerritt,2009-01-07 14:45:00,6129,"Joe... Sorry I did not answer your pm.... I use Limewire.... however I am on a Mac.. In my travels it is fairly easy to spot the porn files... they are typically the ones @ the top of the search... Look for files with more then one host as well...  As for Torrents I use Zuze (Azureus) and normally mininova... but there are various torrent sites I visit.. Look for a high seed / low leech ratio and you should be golden  G,"
288918,xeon,2009-01-07 14:53:00,350,"Tangled Lines said it best. Just find a torrent with the song in it, then if your luckey you will be able to uncheck the songs you dont want.  Also, for more popular song I usually find that googling:  (name of song) mp3      or  (name of song) mp3 download     without brakets gets me good results.  Also try emp3finder.com."

288993,jonnybass,2009-01-07 17:01:00,346,"Since you're even asking the question, I already assume you don't have access to usenet.  So, just use Utorrent and any of the torrent sites like piratebay, isohunt etc.... then uncheck the songs you don't want in the download, as has been mentioned before, or if it's an archived (zipped, rarred etc) file just download the whole album, extract it and then delete the unwanted songs.  If you absolutely must use limewire, use it with much caution. Things like bitrate and file size are good indicators of legit songs vs crap trojan files and viruses. Of course, you should always scan everything you download with an updated virus scanner before opening/playing."
