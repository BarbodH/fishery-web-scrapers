288021,kingjames_2nd,2009-01-05 16:58:00,72,"I just returned from the Sault Ste Marie area in Northern Ontario where a group of us spent some quality time in the bush as well as 1 overnighter in the woods.  We are all very terrible fishermen though and could not find any fish dispite being verbally guided to an exact location buy OFC's pike slayer  The snow was very deep up here.  With out sow shoes we quickly found that we would sink up to our waists.  With snow shoes depending on the location we were able to float almost on the surface. Day 1 daytime temperature -22 c        We found a spot on the river which was open due to rapids then moved down to the slowest part and dropped a baited minnow trap in deepish pool near the bank.  The next morning no fish were found.   We ended up buying some minnows  and then heading out for a day drip to a special little lake to try our hand at ice fishing.  Unfortunately we are all very poor fisher people and caught only memories...  and also a slight sun burn.  Day 2 Daytime temperature -16 c       Upon first arriving at the lake we checked the ice for safety reasons.  We found that the ice was about 12-14 inches thick, largely composed of multiple small layers of ice and slush pockets.  This type of ice is not the best and I would prefer not to walk on it. However, we found that there was 2 inches of clear ice at the bottom followed by about 6 inches of solid white ice and then all the slush and gunk on top so we figured it was probably ok so long as we didn't all stand together at the same place.       I started developing a sun burn on account of my red hair and fair complexion. Soon a headache appeared and I had no sun glasses.  Not wanting to cause permanent damage or even temporary damage which may ruin the rest of the trip, I created some far-out star trek style traditional sunglasses.         I ventured into the woods the next morning to have a look around.  We had also set a few rabbit snares around and were hoping for rabbit stew.  One of our group grew up with a native grandfather who worked a  trap line for years.  Unfortunately, we did not seem to possess the skills to catch a rabbit as he once had. In any case it was still good to march around in the early morning snow. Day 3 daytime temperature -11 c  Here is a small video looking for the rabit snare:       me thinks -> Douglas Fir     We then ventured into another lake close to the last one.  We found a spot located between two hills in a bay.  We set up in the trees and set our fire against a large boulder which we hoped would help to reflect heat.  We dug down into the snow and hollowed out an area while building up walls,  then covered the floor in hemlock boughs, tarp over top, and inside was also a ground sheet tarp.  It was not ideal.  In theory we hoped that the falling snow would land on the tarp and helped to insulate it like  quinsy.( it was coming down heavy at this point)  Perhaps it did insulate, however we all felt very damp and it was hard to stay warm.  Following some advice from Les Stroud in the Survivor Man Thunder bay episode, when you think you have enough fire wood for the night gather 6 times more.  We still ran out. Day 4 and Night time temperatures -5c to -7 c     We did not prepare any where to sit which was a major mistake as we found our selves just sort of standing around for the time before bed, shaking now off of our coats and cooking.     Brad after a particularly restless night.        So in summary, this trip felt like we roughed it to the extreme.  There was about 14 inches of snow accumulation over night which put a bit of a damper on things.  The wood, fire and gear was constantly being buried.  the fish would not bite at all which I blame on the low pressure system.  And the humidity in the air increased the chill factor.  We did not have a snow free place to relax and dry our things which also caused a problem. In the past a clothes line has been hung beside the fire where we could dry our socks and things.  With the constant snow falling,  this was impossible.   I hope you enjoyed the report.  - James"

288065,bigugli,2009-01-05 19:39:00,6138,"Despite the adversities and difficulties encountered, there is no better sense of satisfaction than being able to say ""been there and done it"".  You were no more worse for wear from an experience that most folks would never think to attempt. There is a lot to surviving winter in the bush.  I used to teach bush skills and build snow bungalows with scouts on winter camps. Despite the effort involved it was always a lot of fun.  A hearty well done to you all"
