Single, treble, jig, quick-strike?...what kind of hook/hook combo do you like?  Also...how do you hang the smelt (shinner, whatever) in the water?  Can I assume everyone prefers the minnow to remain horizontal?  Thanks..."
288828,Raf,2009-01-07 04:17:00,3495,"quick strike rig, horizontal.  if the bait you are using is still frozne, you may need to drive a weight into it (big nail or railway tie).  a shiner, smelt is generally too small.  try a 10""+ herring or go to your local fish market and pick up some mackerel or something oily, greasy and stinky."
288835,Raf,2009-01-07 04:38:00,3495,"a pic of a rigged cisco (herring)    note that some cos believe that to be a perfectly fine rig, while others may deem it illegal.  the rig also has a blade and beads that are not in the picture.  commercial quick-strike rigs come with two trebles as well, eventhough that in itself does not make them legal.  replace a treble with a big single if you are concerned."
289090,ScugogBoy,2009-01-07 19:41:00,36,I've had luck rigging a frozen smelt with a single siwash hook through the eye sockets and a second (treble) hook behind the top dorsal.....we let the smelt rest on bottom.......make sure it's sandy or clay bottom not too far from a weed bed (usually 6-20 feet)..... Once you detect movement on the line...let the pike run with it for a few seconds.....once it stops-it's turning it in it's mouth and then give it a good steady tug to set the hook.....if it does not set...wait again till he picks it up again and be patient.
