I know from experience as I also lost my older brother, fishing buddy, best friend, back in April 08. Words cannot comfort the pain that you and your family must be going through. In difficult times like these, people really never know what to say, especially if they didn't know the person. Lean on your friends for strength, and always remember how much you are cared about. May your memories give you strength. They help me in times of need.  God Bless."

288735,Rich Clemens,2009-01-07 01:29:00,3131,Holy Cow Steve.  Losing someone that close is real tough and hard.  Sure sounds like your brother made such a positive impact on your own life and has set the example for many to live by.  Allow Patsy and I to share our deepest condolences at this time to you and your family.

288116,steve_paul,2009-01-05 21:19:00,658,"Last Monday, my Brother, Brian Paul, suffered a heart attack while playing hockey and passed away.  My life, and the lives of our family will never be the same without this incredible man in it.  Trying to find the right words to write about him is difficult because none seem sufficient to say what he meant to me.  He was 15 years older than me but always took the time when I was young to spend time with me, the greatest gift he could have given to me.  I learned so much from him just by watching him and being with him.  No matter what a hellion I was a child, he always came back for more.  He was truly one of the most brilliant people I have ever met and could help you solve any problem - mechanical or personal, just by talking you through it.  He was the consumate husband, father, brother, uncle and son.  He was living his dream, living on the water with his beautiful wife, getting ready for retirement, enjoying quiet time on his boat just cruising up and down the Rideau, anchoring in quiet bays for the night just to enjoy the beauty that nature provides.  He was fiercely proud of my nephew and niece, and rightfully so as they are great kids, I can only hope to provide them the support to get through this that they need.  His giving and caring nature has continued with my son and daughter and they have lost the best uncle you could imagine having.  Life will never be the same for me with Brian gone.  But life continues on and he would want everyone to go on and celebrate life the way he did.  As my nephew Sean said in his tribute to Brian at the funeral, ""When you want to honour Brian, don't raise a glass to him, just do what he would have done and do something nice for someone without asking anything in return""  You will be missed Brian.
