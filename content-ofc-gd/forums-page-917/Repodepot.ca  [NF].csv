Thanks OFC!  BTW --- u might find urself a good lil gem too.  Pachone    OH and ull need to get a login to see the values and prices. My friend was offered a vehicle after he bid LESS than half of the market value. Thats why im asking u guys if this is legit or worth it... sounds too good to be true in a way... whats the catch?"

288458,HTHM,2009-01-06 16:59:00,4082,These are vehicles that have been repo'd How well do you think they are maintained if the owner could not afford the payments???
288461,Bondar,2009-01-06 17:04:00,817,my boss has purchased 3 cars through there what ever the sticker price is on the site offer 30% less
288478,Clampet,2009-01-06 17:58:00,1947,Interesting site fer sure. You may also want to consider.. http://www.trader.ca
288525,steelhedrmatt,2009-01-06 20:21:00,278,There used to be a RepoDepot showroom around the Etobicoke/Miss. Border area near the QEW. Not sure if its still around though.  Went there about 10 years ago when I was buying my first boat. The website should have the directions
288574,sully,2009-01-06 21:45:00,40,"I've sent them numerous emails about boats and trailers they offer on the site. NOT ONE RESPONSE! You have to sign up now too. Don't waste your time, try elsewhere."
288578,Clampet,2009-01-06 21:51:00,1947," It's called Asset. 76 Fordhouse Blvd 	Etobicoke, ON M8Z 5X7 (416) 977-7771"
288693,Andrew,2009-01-07 00:34:00,54, Are you sure Repot Depot isn't there as well still?  It was right on Queensway west of the Ikea.  I used to work done there and drive by it all the time whoever i'm rarely down there these days...
288722,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-07 01:08:00,2585,i have heard of some people buying from them and having no problems at all.  most repos arent abused they just could make payments  cheers!
288797,Dusky,2009-01-07 02:54:00,310,"I was there this afternoon as I am also in market for a car, usually the way they work is, you bid on vehicle and if you are the top bidder or close to there ball park price they contact you, then you put a deposit and can take car for test drive meanwhile they contact the bank and if bank agree on price car is yours."
288827,maybe,2009-01-07 04:17:00,307,"They had a few Suburbans up for grabs when I was looking for ours.  The whole ""give us all kinds of personal information before we'll tell you what the price of the car is"" thing struck me as pretty slimy.  After plunking in some fake ID, the prices turned out to be quite high.  We paid less for an Optimum recertified vehicle at an actual GM dealer - sticker price, no haggling.  I'd think if you missed enough payments to have the car taken away from you, you likely haven't splurged on oil changes or alignments for some time.  Have you seen the North Toronto Auto Auction?  We saw some absolute steals there, just nothing on the block in the year/model we wanted.  They put the results of the most recent sale online so you can see what things went for.  Here's a link."
