288019,BigSmallie,2009-01-05 16:40:00,61,We are looking at Sturgeon Bay Provincial Park for a family camping trip this summer. Anyone been there? Good or bad? Hows the fishing?
288031,bow slayer,2009-01-05 17:48:00,1074,I stayed there once. It seemed okay  small park though. The fishing was good for pike and bass. There are lots of islands so it would be easy to get lost so we never ventured far for the 3 days there. There was some good walleye fishing further out in the bay but we stayed closer.For a couple days it would be okay but for a week or longer there are larger parks in the area that offer more activities.
288306,BigSmallie,2009-01-06 04:05:00,61,Thanks Bowslayer for the info. Is there a decent ramp? How's the panfish fishing for the kids? Thanks in advance!

Pointe Au Baril lots of water, it`s been years since I have been there but still fish there. Lot`s of rocks in the water so a little caution is needed and a lot of islands, just a question of getting used to knowing which way to go. There are good maps of the area.  The park is pretty far back from the main lake and mostly sheltered water."
