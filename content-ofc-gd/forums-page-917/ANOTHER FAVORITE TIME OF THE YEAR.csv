286427,Grimace,2009-01-01 03:04:00,2020,"Well That was a pretty amazing game.    Both teams played amazing.   Hard hitting, great plays, great saves at both ends and just and all around amazing game by both Canada and the U.S.A   WOW."
286428,misfish,2009-01-01 03:05:00,29133,"If god were to strike me down right now,I would say,I just watched the best game ever. Not that because we won,but it was the best game I have watched in many a years. WOW. I feal like ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Something tells me,there will be a part two,as there will not be a Canada/Russia final."
286538,Rizzo,2009-01-01 13:34:00,4754,"Sounds like I missed a good one. To back up a few games though, they have to do something about that goal differential rule as a tiebreaker. when you have teams that have such different talent levels its a stupid tiebreaker...flip a coin for Pete's sakes or penalty minutes or smelliest jersey...whatever it takes but forcing these kids to rack up a 15 goal lead is unsportsmanlike"
286540,Grimace,2009-01-01 13:41:00,2020,I am with you on that one Rizzo.    Maybe a goal differential with a limit of +/- 5 that can be gained or lossed for each game.     Anyhow last nights game was unbelievable.
286639,Cookslav,2009-01-01 18:06:00,1457," Agreed...heck of a match, and what quick paced game!!! I've said it before and I'll say it again.... This tournament is the BEST hockey of the year. I'd rather get tickets to the juniors gold medal match then Lord stanleys mug any day. You simply cannot beat the intensity, and the heart these kids throw out there for the world to see.  Love it!"
286800,chickenhawk,2009-01-02 01:37:00,612, now now.....i love the NHL playoffs those guys give it all they got.......but yes...the juniors are awesome to watch as well.....can't wait till we play the Russians in the semis...should be another good game....so long as Slovakia doesen't make another upset but i doubt it....
286971,Cookslav,2009-01-02 16:49:00,1457,"Ya NHL is ok I guess...  I just never returned as big of a fan after the strike. Truth be told I started frequenting the local Ranger(OHL) games during the strike even more then I had before, and basicly came to realize I I enjoy the OHL as much as the NHL so why spend more dough? I'm lucky that with my Job I often travel to Sarnia & Peterborough so I check them out on occasion, and sometimes find myself in St. Johns watchign the Fog Devils(QMJHL) One thing I can say with 100% certainty is there is more heart in those Junior regular season games IMO. And they tend to be 10x as intense and ""most"" NHL season game. But the NHL Play offs are a different story...thats some good stuff right there.  But In all honesty I would seriously would rather be in Ottawa to see the Boys play for gold, then watch some random team hoist the stanley cup, but thats just me If it were the leafs which won't happen any time soon...I might change my mind   Now that would be something wouldn't it? Can't say I see it going down like that but I'd love to see it happen!"
287075,misfish,2009-01-02 21:48:00,29133, Dont speak so soon.
287119,misfish,2009-01-03 00:25:00,29133,"Can you say,hang yer head down,or should it be, hold yer heads proud Slovaks.  WTG. Tremedous goaltending."
287121,Cookslav,2009-01-03 00:29:00,1457,Wow...I Didn't think it would happen but I LOVE it
287703,chickenhawk,2009-01-04 18:48:00,612,how bout that russian game.....man o man i was on the edge of my seat all game.....i still can't believe we tied it up in the the last seconds.....one more left to go and it is going to be a beauty....Canada vs. Sweden at 7:30 on Monday night....
287715,holdfast,2009-01-04 19:28:00,1813,"I think Canada Really got lucky on this one.  Lots of Penalty chances.  A Blunder by the Russian that missed the open net.  All I got to say, is, they got to play a lot better against the Swedes.  As far as Goal tending, hopefully he does better, especially if Canadian Scoring chances are going to be at a minimum.  With all that said, great game, second to the USA game in my opinion."
287765,Governator,2009-01-04 22:17:00,879,"Canada vs Sweden is my rivalry, the one I never forget and love to watch.  It was 1990, I was only 7 years old playing in a bowling tournament up in Barrie (where I now live). Canada vs Sweden was playing that day, it was 4-4 after OT and it went to a shootout. The entire bowling tournament paused during this time and everyone huddled around a small TV in the top corner next to the bar. Loud cheers when we scored and boos when we didn't. Sweden won the shootout and won the game 5-4.  It made the rest of that day very depressing.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_World_Ju...y_Championships  Check out January 3rd. It's the first day I ever watched this tournament and it's the day I got hooked on junior hockey at a young age. Canada vs Sweden is where it's at for me, can't wait for tomorrow.   Also, about a month later we lost to Sweden again this time at the world championships and again in a shootout.  Forsberg put on a sick move to win the gold that year.  Go Canada Go"

288278,carp-starter,2009-01-06 03:01:00,253,"Bye, bye sweden - it is now 5 to 1 - maybe we can score 1 more???  carp-starter   FINAL"
288279,douG,2009-01-06 03:02:00,2693,"Nice to see the Boys make good in our national game (it's not lacrosse, honest).  A fine performance against a tough club.  5-peat anybody?"
284172,misfish,2008-12-27 00:28:00,29133,"Lets give them hell boys. Being that the games in Canada this year,you can bet, the BODY will be played and we,ll be there come the finals.  GO CANADA GO"
284180,Greencoachdog,2008-12-27 00:41:00,8163,What the hell are you talkin' aboot boy???
284184,misfish,2008-12-27 00:48:00,29133," Come on Dawg,it,s the world juniors. You know,the game that we beat yer   at,LOLJ/K"
284187,Rizzo,2008-12-27 00:54:00,4754,"sadly the world is not watching. People paying attention to junior hockey seems to be only a Canadian pastime. Even hockey countries like Sweden and Finland don't seem to give a you-know-what when it comes to this tourney...so they put it in Canada where the arenas will be full! I remember watching some games in past years when other countries hosted and you could practically shoot a cannon through the arena. Either way, we'll be watching what should amount to some great hockey."

284193,Mike Pike,2008-12-27 01:06:00,1332,"Well it ain't hog callin' GCD!  lol  Yup, besides opening up presents, the World Juniors is my favorite part of the season too, Misfish.  I remember watching years ago when the Canadians were never favoured.  Man, have times changed.  Too bad we have to endure Pierre Maguire throughout.  His ramblings are pretty annoying."
284198,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-27 01:22:00,2585,decent last 10 minutes of the first period.  i think some nerves got to them the first 10 minutes.  GO CANADA GO
284239,misfish,2008-12-27 03:00:00,29133,Got to love the playing of the Anthem. Great job by the boys.  
284240,misfish,2008-12-27 03:01:00,29133,"  I knew you would.nt understand. Concidering there was ""ICE INVOLVED"".LOL"
284846,Squid,2008-12-28 21:45:00,1656,7-0 against Borat!! crazy hockey!!
284861,misfish,2008-12-28 22:35:00,29133,"Although I cheer on the boys,we ""ALL"" knew,this was no challange for the boys. Heck they had 30 players to choose from. I am going back to watch the finish. That goalie better get the player of the game for KAS."
284904,misfish,2008-12-28 23:51:00,29133," Makes one think ,,,,,,,,,,,,WHY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, WHY even show up,put the dollars out,,,Well, even though they know they will get spanked,there a few players that should get show cased. How else will they be seen.  Im not impressed with the 15 goal performance. When it was 9-0, thats when they should of worked on some drills.  I dont see the Germans giving them trouble,but we all know what a Canada vs USA game can do,YEP PUT,EM UP. (Maybe the dawg will watch that one)  I see a Canada vs Russia final. Im not calling a winner in that one,as Iam not confident in the Canadian goal tendending. Seem lost to me."
284960,chickenhawk,2008-12-29 01:38:00,612,Canadians have a strong team again this year........teams like the US will not be able to play with our guys this year.....Canada vs. Russia in the final......as long as they can keep putting up points on the power play we should be able to handle the russians.......i really like watching Ryan Ellis....used to play hockey on my team a couple years ago.....he is one of the smartest players on that team....really exciting to watch....
285026,Grimace,2008-12-29 04:21:00,2020,I was a little unimpressed with the 15-0 as I tend to think such things are unsportsmanlike but then again the Borat's were so bad they almost couldn't help but score.  Canada will beat Russia in the Final.
285064,chickenhawk,2008-12-29 12:15:00,612,i think our guys were class acts.....they didn't wanna embarass them.....the pucks jus kept goin in......hopefully Kazakhstan can pull out a win in this tournament.....
285088,Sandbag,2008-12-29 13:33:00,533,"Grimace...normally I would agree with you about running up the score to 15-0 is unsportsmanlike.  However in this tournament, goal differential is what is used in a tiebreak situation so they don't really have a choice except to continue playing and scoring if possible.  If Canada was to let up against Khasakstan and say another pool team (ie the Checks) did not let up against them.  if Canada and the Checks were tied after pool play, the goal differential would be the deciding factor.  Don't like seeing scores like that myself but I'm afraid the boys don't have much of a choice.  Cheers  Craig"
285120,Grimace,2008-12-29 15:22:00,2020,"I agree.   I mentioned that they couldn't help but to score. They did everything  but shoot wide. LOL.   Goal differential will not be a factor, we will go undefeated.   Like chickenhawk said the pucks just kept going in."
285407,chickenhawk,2008-12-30 01:51:00,612,well so far I haven't been real impressed with the way they have played against the Germans so far 2-1 is the score......Ryan Ellis is playin hard as always....lol sorry used to play on my team....but what a play he made at the blueline to set up the 2nd goal for our boys.....
285444,bucktail,2008-12-30 02:29:00,1857,Go boys...... heart and soul of Canada!
285461,misfish,2008-12-30 03:17:00,29133,"Interesting game. Yes we won,but was the Geramn team that good or did the boys hold back this time?? Maybe it was,""It,s Canada, let,s beat them""  Glad to see thier goalie got the player of the game for them. Being a father of a goalie, and a defencemen for many years,I can see why he got it. They are so under rated in a game.  Ok, now we got the USA up next. I am looking forward to this one. That will be the test."
285533,chickenhawk,2008-12-30 12:15:00,612,i am also looking forward to the US game on wednesday.....our guys are gonna have to come out harder than they did last night.....keep throwin hits and we shoudl be able to beat them down.....  Hawk
285975,Cookslav,2008-12-31 03:32:00,1457," I don't think they held back? The German team played well...for being out skilled by a mile. They were twice the size of our boys, and they did a great job playing a physical game, which is about all they had to offer (besides a pretty dam good little goaltender) To be honest I think the physical play made the boys think a bit before crossing the blue line, and charging the corners. Not that they had to think all that hard about it, but it was the first game in this tourny playing a sizeable opponent, and the first time anyone was dishing some punishment back at them...  It took the boys until the 3rd period to figure it out completely, so... Ya I'd say the Germans played good...The Candians were just ALOT better.  It was probobly a great thing to get a physical game out of the way considering is the USA next..."
286387,misfish,2009-01-01 01:20:00,29133, WOW Thats all I got too say about the first period.
286412,tapout,2009-01-01 02:10:00,166,I add a WOW to the second period.  Nice save our boy in net made!
286415,misfish,2009-01-01 02:21:00,29133,"Did you see that. That was so stoked. One more to go.  I am very surprised ,that Sweden has gone down.  Good job by the Slovaks"
