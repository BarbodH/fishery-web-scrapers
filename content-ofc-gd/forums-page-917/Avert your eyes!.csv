288542,kemper,2009-01-06 20:41:00,2232,"Nope I was floating, too cold for the fly.  Notice the orange tinge on the fin and around the mouth? Thats not the camera, this particular river causes a strange orange tinge on the fish in the winter and I have never figured out why. Maybe its because it flows through a bog?"
