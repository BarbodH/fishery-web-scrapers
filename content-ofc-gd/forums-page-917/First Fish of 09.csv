Got mine through the website, easy and simple.  A few eastern tribs were frozen, except for this particular river. Winter green with good flow!  Chartuse was the lucky colour roe bag  Its a male right?"
288044,TennesseeGuy,2009-01-05 18:24:00,957,Nice fish.  Thanks for posting the photo.  Too bad about not getting to have school today.  Maybe they'll catch up.  Later.

288052,diggyj,2009-01-05 18:53:00,548,Excellent Catch.  Colour is amazing.
288060,wuchikubo,2009-01-05 19:12:00,1114,"  Slime initiation, what's wrong with that? At least he's toasty warm. Feeling cold while fishing makes it less desirable.   Nice 'bow."
288138,young_one,2009-01-05 21:56:00,620,"Haha I know I shouldn't wear the Goose to go fishing, but like HearingFish said, its just so warm that none of my other jackets can compair."
288144,nuke,2009-01-05 22:11:00,60,"Nice fish !  I never would have thought about hitting the tribs at this time of year.  Before reading reading your post, I saw some steelie action on the river in Ajax south of the big 4 (trying not to give the exact location !).  Streamers seem to work.  Mike"
