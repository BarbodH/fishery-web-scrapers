288118,joonmoon,2009-01-05 21:20:00,528,Just wanted to wet a line and try out our repaired/patched hut before heading any distance. Got to a local pond and set up fishin by 10:30 am. Tried jiggin with ice jigs and minnow combos for the first while then a jig and gulp waxie for a bit too. Picked up a few small bites then the odd decent one. My better half and I iced half a dozen dink perch with only 2 close to keeper size. Came home with these guys for an evening snack. Good thing I decided to try out our huge deepsea rod and winch for a reel or we would of had some trouble crankin em in....lol.  
288121,bbog,2009-01-05 21:23:00,665,You got me to read this post through false pretenses!
288128,wuchikubo,2009-01-05 21:37:00,1114,"Got me too, I was thinking I was going to see a 15""or 16"" perch."
288133,jediangler,2009-01-05 21:46:00,1923,"So Bro, how did the repaired/patched hut work for you?"
288137,joonmoon,2009-01-05 21:56:00,528,Well we didn't freeze and the hut stayed together ok. Not enuff snow on the pond to pack around to prevent the wind from creeping up underneath the flaps tho. Would have been chilly without the heater too. Strong winds today and the Eskimo held up well.
288139,fishing,2009-01-05 21:57:00,167,Those two perch are not dinky for sure. Thanks for the report.
288142,Slayingm,2009-01-05 22:10:00,204,Great job JoonMoon..... best tasting fish for sure!!!!.....Greg.
288151,joonmoon,2009-01-05 22:25:00,528,We were hoping and trying hard for a few more to make a decent meal but oh well they will just add to tonites dinner instead of being the main course.
288161,Leecher,2009-01-05 22:59:00,7832,Great report and pic joonmoon  Next time out try Gulp Alive Fish Fry in white on a small jig head.... was a killer yesterday at the bay  Good job to both of you and thanks for sharing Leechman
288177,Mike Pike,2009-01-05 23:34:00,1332,"Hey Joon, just scale 'em, remove the head and entrails, and those purty little perch will fill the plates just nicely!  Thanks for the report and pics.  Nice!"
288185,Greencoachdog,2009-01-05 23:49:00,8163,"If that's a 12' surf casting rod and reel, those Perch are indeed HUGE!!!  "
288647,blakewalk,2009-01-06 23:34:00,86,"Nice appetizers, JoonMoon, whereabouts did you set up?"
288745,joonmoon,2009-01-07 01:42:00,528,"In a pond locally...if I tell you I'll have to kill you...lol. East of K-W. It's a well known spot to fish just not into sharing exactly where due to the pressure it would recieve...the area can't take a major hit, its too small to withstand a lot of pressure. I can tell you though in the last 5 or so years the average size has increased slightly...I do think it's due to the efforts of ice fishermen releasing way more than they're keepin. C & R works."
288753,TJQ,2009-01-07 01:48:00,7806,Dammittt... made me look!
288767,blakewalk,2009-01-07 02:13:00,86,"Fair enough! haha! I like to do a canoe run from Elora down to Brantford every summer if the water's high enough, but never snuck about in the KW area too much."
