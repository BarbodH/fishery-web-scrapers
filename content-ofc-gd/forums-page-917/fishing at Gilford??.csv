288160,Terry,2009-01-05 22:58:00,14456,a lot of the bigger ones were caught between 20 and 30'

288205,paulyboy83,2009-01-06 00:25:00,54,I concur with Terry.  Try the 20-24 ft range. Walk north of Gilford rd until your even with Kontiki Marina (Orange buildings on shore).   Go about 1/2-5/8 of km east from shore and you should be in the right range.  I've got a spot on my Gps I hit twice last year and then again last Friday.  Hasn't let me down yet.  It's in the above mentioned vicinity.  Good luck and let us know how you did. PB
