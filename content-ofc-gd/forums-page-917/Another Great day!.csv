288313,limeyangler,2009-01-06 04:25:00,5204,"Hi Y'all,   Well, guess I’m an addict....lol...went back for trout again.  my buddy matt called me at work last night and asked the dumbest question....""do you wanna go fishing tomorrow?""....lol...duh! are there bubbles when a duck f@rts?  My wife was at work so no worries there, got the snowblowing and chores done that afternoon...so tomorrow was good to go!  Well tomorrow turned to today and we eventually set off to Thunder lake again, arriving at around 10am.  We set up the shack, Matt was loving the new shack and heater.....as the last time we went to thunder Lake together nearly a year ago to the day, it was -25 Celsius like today...but last year there was a strong 20kmh wind...I got frost nip on my fingers that day...WE FROZE, not today...nice and warm.     ME LAST YEAR AFTER OUR DAY ON THUNDER LAKE....DARN IT WAS COLD THAT DAY.....AAHHHH THE MEMORIES          We found the spot I was at the other day despite the snow dump of the past few days(next years toy is a GPS) and were greeted by a sonar screen showing a 10 foot deep band of smelt.....PERFECT!        LOTS OF BAITFISH UNDER US         We did not get any bites for almost an hour. We had two lines each, jigging inside the hut with static lines outside within view from inside....did I mention it was freezing cold out there today?...lol I was getting a little impatient...guess I’ve been spoiled the last couple of days, and started to get a little bored so tried for some whities...with one hit, but in hindsight probably a ling. After an hour Matt got into a little one, and I followed quickly after that with a nice keeper, we were both using jigs with 6"" sucker minnows. Matt also got a hit on his other line but it got off at the hole.     MATT GOT THE FIRST ONE          I FOLLOWED WITH A GOOD SIZE ONE FOR THUNDER LAKE           THIS ONE GOT OFF AT THE HOLE AFTER MATT DID THE HUNDRED YARD DASH TO HIS ROD  <a href=""http://s263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/?action=view¤t=IMG_2605.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/IMG_2605.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>      After the one that got away for Matt, I went on a missed bite/one that got away spree like never before....I just had to laugh...it was ridiculous, Matt also lost a couple in the next half hour, but up to 1 pm we did land a couple more...all pretty small and we set them loose to fatten up.       DONT THINK I""VE EVER HAD SO MANY FISH GET OFF IN A ROW!  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/missedfishmovie.flv"">     It went pretty quiet for about an hour and then picked right up again. We were seeing lots of trout, chasing our baits up and down the water column on the graph, we were trying to rob the fish off each other on the screen which was a real hoot. We'd see a fish chasing the others bait, then lower your own bait to the fish and try and distract it from the others line...lol...got pretty competitive...great fun.    We also got into a few Ling too, not really big enough to keep so they went back, they were hugging the bottom but were not shy once you got their interest and would come up to 20 foot off bottom to nail the bait.       GOT SOME LING  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/lingmovie.flv"">                 WE GOT LOTS OF TROUT, MOSTLY LITTLE, BUT WE KEPT 3 NICE ONES....IVE HAD TROUT FOR SUPPER TWICE IN 3 OR $ DAYS...I""M GOOD FOR A WHILE NOW...lol  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/catchingsome.flv"">"

288318,solopaddler,2009-01-06 04:36:00,8605,"Nice job bud, that first laker of yours is pretty decent!"

288380,corvette1,2009-01-06 13:26:00,1765,simon you dont need to much of an arm twist to go fishing congrats on the lakers
288395,trapshooter,2009-01-06 13:54:00,1234,"Looks like another fun day Simon, lots of action at least.  You gotta get off the barbless hooks though. hahaha."

Congratulations  But I think you got to practice a little more on the hook set Looks nice and warm inside the new shelter compared to outside..... got to love it eh  Keep it up and thanks for sharing Jacques"
288423,Beans,2009-01-06 15:19:00,3339," Priceless reply...never heard that one before...LMAO !  Great report, pics and videos..."
288645,limeyangler,2009-01-06 23:33:00,5204,  thats the reason!!!!    
288698,Ramble,2009-01-07 00:38:00,713,I'm definatly Jelous. Awesome report. Keep them coming. Maybe you should try targeting the ling sometime if you want a change from lakers.  -R-
288702,Greencoachdog,2009-01-07 00:44:00,8163,"Great report, pics, vids, and fish Simon!!!  Noice Lakers!!!... and I'd have kept the Burbots to go along with the Lakers. How many Burbots are you allowed to keep up there? I've always wanted to catch some of those!"
288707,brkygetr,2009-01-07 00:49:00,425,just another day in NW Ontario eh Simon.... so thats what lakers are supposed to look like...  Cheer and keep up the good work
288795,trapshooter,2009-01-07 02:51:00,1234,"For me, I don't 'get' the barbless thing.  My goal is to CATCH the fish.  I'd rather replace barbed trebles with single barbed then go barbless.  That's just my opinion though.  I absolutely HATE it when fish 'pop' off.  You've done everything right to get the fish to hit and then to lose it due to a tackle malfunction (no barbs) is silly.  There's my barbless rant! lol"
288840,profisher25,2009-01-07 05:39:00,185,Nice laker's!   all those misses kinda payed off in the end!
