287918,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-05 04:49:00,10439,Even after 25 years I'm still kicking myself in the   for passing up a sweet deal on a 1969 Ford Talladega Cale Yarborough Special.  I didn't have the cash at the time and when I approached the owner 2 years later when I had the $$$$ he had decided to keep it!!!!
