If you see this post every year, and it irritates you every year, then why not stop reading it and keeping it alive by constantly responding to it?  Good on ya smalliefisher for bringing it to folks attention. You'll notice that it's almost always bait containers, rarely lure packages.....hmmmm something about live-bait fisherman"
288355,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-06 11:41:00,3761,Has anybody seen the causeway at Lake Scugog...now that is discusting and pathetic
288368,crabbs,2009-01-06 12:41:00,14,"cigarette butts like how long are we gonna put up with that, on the ice, streets where ever ...look after YOUR garbage... dirty slobs"
288372,holdfast,2009-01-06 13:05:00,1813,"Speaking of Trash, one of my Jobs as the Village Foreman is to keep the Village Resort clean.  Yea I pick up trash.  Its totally unbelievable.  There is absolutely no respect for the Environment, Local citizens and in this case other fisherman.  One day Ill spend a few hours picking up trash and the next Day I cant believe the Garbage people left behind the last evening.  Mostly McDonald's Crap, Timmies, Bottles, cans, etc.  I told the Mayor, my Boss, that I refuse to pick up the Garbage around the Hotel ( Local Drinking establishment) because I absolutely think its degrading for me to pick it up when dozens of patrons and employees sit there smoking and joking instead of picking it up. I found that its mostly the out of towners that are the worst culprits. Its a small town here and word gets around fast and I believe most villagers here respect their own town. One good point though, I was busy working on a culvert when I heard a commotion behind me, an older fella giving a teenager heck for tossing crap on the ground.  I watched the kid pick it up, waited till the Snr take off then he dumped on the ground again like a smartass with a big smile on his puss..  The Army came out of me when I embarrassed him in front of his girlfriend.  My point is, its everybody's responsibility to clean your campsites, towns, etc.  Don'T just rely on the guy getting paid, because its never ending and its a poor attitude ( yea, someone else will do it!).  I found this type thread more interesting when it came out last year with the originator showing pictures of trash that he obviously picked up around his favorite fishing hole.  He got congratulated as a do-er and not a  whiner"
288646,Greencoachdog,2009-01-06 23:33:00,8163,   oops!... did I just accidently burn you with my cigarette?... sorry!    You're absolutely right Holdie!
288244,Greencoachdog,2009-01-06 01:43:00,8163, Of course you do and don't... or is it the other way around?      Oh! you must mean way out in the bush like in this thread?... notice the frog pic!  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...amp;hl=cochrane
288266,Twocoda,2009-01-06 02:41:00,4130,Personally 1 i think this post should hit the forum every year ( hats off to smalliefisher for posting ) even if some that have been here for many years dont approve  2 Thanks GDC for not approving....  Although I'm new to this Forum i can see how reading the same thing year in and year out can get a bit monotonous with out the total solution ever being achieved but by debating the issue as you gentlemen have been ......it IS drawing attention from other members ( new and old) with a dramatic twist to it ( which is a good thing) cuz possibly ....when a party is sitting in their hut and the fishing is slow ...the drama of this thread might be brought up in conversation after BillyRayJayBob chucks his beer can down a hole after butting his last cigarette out in a tim hortons cup....it just may hit someone's sub-conscience in that party to do the right thing...we can only hope ......so i say ...debate the issue well into may so the weekend warriors that come up here for rainbow opener might  be a little wiser with their litter....  The biggest thing i picked up was 13 miles out off the Bruce power plant .....an 8 foot PT fence post with 20 yards of high tensile wire fence still attached...it wasnt easy to get on my boat by myself but i did it ......imagine hitting that with a boat at any speed in the dark ...waaaaay out there !!!!  The frog pic was ruined because of the litter  Just my 2 cents (CAD)
288320,waterwolf,2009-01-06 04:42:00,556,"it's only getting worse . the influx of new inducties into the realm of being a true canadian hasn't done the eco any good to say the least. it's a repeat of the beginning of the 20th century. "" let's go see and experience the wonder of the great wild , outdoors. "" or "" oh leave the trash , someones's getting paid to pick that up"" .    now  it seems those who can't afford the energy to pull up their pants to hide their ass-crack share the same lack of drive to remove the trash they discard. it's become very clear ,it's a ME ,,NOW,generation.  no perfect parents out there , myself included , but my teenaged daughter is  very aware that litter and eco-ignorance is no longer working ."
