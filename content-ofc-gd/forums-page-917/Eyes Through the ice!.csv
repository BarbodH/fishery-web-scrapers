I have patterned the fish pretty good, but i was wondering what the rest of you fine fisherman/women would tie on the end of your line to fool a few walters into bitting.........    Any tips would be great!    Thanks in advance Buckster(Tony)"
288687,douG,2009-01-07 00:24:00,2693,"My first choice would definitely be a jig and minnow.  No wait, it would positively be a jig and a grub.  No wait, I haven't gone yet, it would be a spoon and tail.  Or a deadsticked dead shiner.  What I really meant to say was a jigging rap tipped with a minnow head on the dropper.  I've always believed that you need to find hungry fish, the rest is easy.  Let us know how you make out."

288781,trapshooter,2009-01-07 02:31:00,1234,Nipissing - do yourself a favour and get some 1/8th oz GLOW jigs and tip them with a minnow.  Glow is killer on Nipissing in my experiences.
288783,Sinker,2009-01-07 02:35:00,8692,I like the glow stuff too. Works great for me on eyes.  Sinker
