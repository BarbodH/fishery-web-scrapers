288718,MJL,2009-01-07 01:04:00,2427,"I build rods as a hobby and it's always fascinating watching them manufacturing them.  A few years ago Sage sent me a DVD as a promotional thing on their own manufacturing process (pretty much the same as the Loomis vid).  If you e-mail them, they might still have have copies left.  A few other rod companies have done similar vids like Thomas & Thomas (Discovery Channel) as well as Winston fly rods which can be viewed here (Go to 'company films'):  http://www.winstonrods.com/winston_channel.html  Thanks for the link"

288788,Radnine,2009-01-07 02:43:00,1538,Holly doodle!! No wonder I can't afford their rods. I will have to wait until they become G-Singh so I can have a crack at one. Thanks for the post. Jim
