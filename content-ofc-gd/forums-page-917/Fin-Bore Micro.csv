288731,Beats,2009-01-07 01:23:00,543,"HI, after talking to a few ppl here on OFC, I am leaning towards buying a Fin-Bore Micro 6"" auger.  I can't seem to find one in London and I have found them online with quite a range in price.  First off, is there only 1 model of the Fin-Bore micro?  I have only ever seen it as a 6"", is there an 8"" version?  Also, sometimes it seems to be referred to as a Fin-Bore III micro but usually just a Fin-Bore micro.. is it all the same model?  Lastly, anyone know a place to pick one up in the London area or, if not, where I could find a decent on-line deal that won't be a ton of cash for shipping?  Thanks"

288738,irishfield,2009-01-07 01:35:00,26272,They had them last year... but I just did an on-line search of CTC ice fishing and it's not there.  $83.94 at Lebarons on-line catalogue  $89.95 at the fishin hole  https://www.thefishinhole.com/index.cfm?pro...791&siteMap
288741,Beats,2009-01-07 01:37:00,543,"  Yeah, that was my first attempt.  Tried 2 different stores in town and they had Normark augers but not the micro.  THe online selection doesn't show the micro either..."
288746,joonmoon,2009-01-07 01:45:00,528,Are there any local bait and tackle shops?
288750,irishfield,2009-01-07 01:48:00,26272,"Innisfil Bait and tackle sells them for $110.  Looks like the original is a 6""... now the ""NEW"" FIn-bore micro III is available in 4.5/6 and 8 inch  http://www.livebaitandtackle.com/products.php?cat=344"
288751,Beats,2009-01-07 01:48:00,543,"THere's a few around.  I looked at Angling Outfitter's (near Woodstock) which is the best (IMO) and didn't see one there... didn't try the smaller shops.  I guess that's the obvious next step.  Usually Angling Outfitters has anything you could want. SO when I didn't find one there, I just started thinking I was going to resort to online shopping."
288754,Beats,2009-01-07 01:49:00,543,"  Thanks a lot for the link.   I'll be checking that out.   EDIT: the 4.5 and 8"" doesn't actually say ""micro"" just that it's new with a telescopic handle... wonder what the differences are?"
288798,Beats,2009-01-07 02:55:00,543,Sent an email to livebaitandtackle.com asking what the differences are and the size comparison.  Hopefully they reply.
288875,Beats,2009-01-07 12:35:00,543,"Thanks for the help.  Ordered the 6"" Micro Fin-Bore from Lebarons."
