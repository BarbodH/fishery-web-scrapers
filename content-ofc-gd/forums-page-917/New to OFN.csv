288658,blakewalk,2009-01-06 23:46:00,86,"Hello; I'm new to the boards.  Just recently moved down from Barrie to Bronte; only a five minute hike from PetroPark (although, so far, it has been nothing to brag about).  Everybody seems pretty friendly here, just thought I might ask: who's in the Oakville/Burlington area?  Sometimes head out to the mouth at Bronte or Sixteen Mile, but it seemed pretty quiet late autumn this year past.  Anybody get a good score out there?"

288715,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-07 00:59:00,2585,welcome aboard.  oakville guy here.  I grew up fishing the 16 and bronte but im a bass man so i tend to stay away from the trout guys in the fall.  cheers!
288760,Marko,2009-01-07 01:59:00,854,Welcome aboard man. I fish that area quite often in the fall and its been nothing to brag about. Hit one run head on and thats when i hooked quite a few of them but other then that its nothing to brag about.
288765,blakewalk,2009-01-07 02:10:00,86,"Thanks for the replies!  The only luck I've had on Bronte (I've only fished Petro) is on outside bend pools and one hit under the railroad bridge.  For now, I just hit the pier when I can- but have gotten only a couple wee perch and a sheepshead; did see a man pull a nice big bow outta there in october though (extended season)."
