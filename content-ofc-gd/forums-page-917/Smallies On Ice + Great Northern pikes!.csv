287429,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-03 23:47:00,709,Iv waitted ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL week and it finnaly happened!!!!  My favorite pike lake was on the menu and we didnt waste any minutes .  Rendez-Vous @ 9am.  In monster pike Bay! paul (whitespinnerbait) mike and i  set up our lines and it didnt take 10 minutes befor we landed this beautifull BRONZE BACK!    NOTE: bass are legal in quebec on ice!  I yell to mike ON YOUR LEFT the tip up right on his left went down and he didnt see it!  2-3 minutes after fish comes back ... just a light bite but with a nice result!      mike was getting all the action when sudenly pauls turn!(lets hope he's going to post his pictures)  he caught 3- 4 pikes and half a dozen bass.!  i was out jigging but the bite was slow on the jig... they wanted dead minnows!  put the jigging rod down now its my turn!  me and mike had shared 5 tip ups and paul had put up 4 and his jigging rod...  so we had 10 tip-ups spreaded out.... Give the fish a chance you say? we only practive C&R anyways!  only the ones that are hooked deep. we keep .  TIP-UP goes down........................ RUN! slip BASH MY KNEE on some ice but i still landed the fish!  the head shakes were light. BASS.... HOG!      maneged some pike too! Iv never seen the fish this active in my ice fishing career!      Then its lunch time.......i seem to have a lunch curse! everytime i go to eat a sandwich and take a 5 minute brake.......FISH ON!!! But this time a double header!  In this picture mike is ''showing off'' the colors of the smallies!    After a while the locals came to see what the action was all about!(Whitespinnerbaits friends)  he had brought the whole gang with him so we decided that the next 3- 4 fish they could get into the action!  WELL!!!!!!!!!!! this is where it gets GOOOOOOOOD!  tip-up goes down. we tell the kids RUN! RUN ! RUN! they look at us like we are crazy! but one smart little girl ran!  and she caught a fish that she never knew was in her OWN LAKE! The biggest pike of the day !! 10 LBS +    TWAS a hell of a Great day to be out. SUNNY COLD WINDY! The best!!!!!  24/7

287707,tip-up,2009-01-04 18:57:00,94,Great report Amigos. Are you fellas going to be out this week? Have two days planned for big pike and smallies on that lake with Anthony and a few freinds. Was thinking of starting at Mud Bay and try out a few other locations How deep are you finding the smallies? Thanks Kev  Good fishing.
287710,Fishing 24/7,2009-01-04 19:08:00,709,  tip-up.  i suggest you hit the place where you were catching the pike late in the falls...  iv found out that pike are territorial and will not move from there last spot in LATE falls.  we were RIGHT over a salad bar mixed with some angel hair weed bed. put the minnow right above the bed not IN!  the smallies were @ the weed lines IN 20 - 25 FOW.  its the first time we fished this lake early like this last year the samllies were in 30 - 40 FOW. off a rocky point drop off.  im thinking they go deeper as the ice fishing goes.  hope you gets some on the jigging rods. i jigged all day without anything. BIG DEAD SHINNERS was the key.  give them time to swallow the bait and you will have success.!  your a better jigger than me so tell me what happens after your outting. id love to get some info off of you.  IE: what was working what dept and what not. i know its diff. from lake to lake but still good to know!  Keep me updated!
