288002,diggyj,2009-01-05 15:20:00,548,I was hoping to fire up the sled this weekend and hit the ice on my local lake but as you can see it obviously isn't safe as there are still large sections with free flowing water. Mother nature isn't cooperating.    
288063,Clampet,2009-01-05 19:31:00,1947,Which body of water is this?
