Finally found small Perch near the pile of ice, way out, slightly east. We ended the day with maybe 20 just keepers very small for 4 guys. Ice was OK but we walked watching very closely. Some spots looked scary. It was nice to be on the bay again. If your going out be very careful your on your own. I think we counted 12 guys out all day. It varied 4"" to 6"" 7"", Over at the pile ice I drilled down about 15"" then lose ice under that. I think that pile ice reaches the bottom. I tried fishing their because it could be a structure thing, maybe the Perch would be around there. The only thing, there was a lot of dinkers. I caught 1 Mud Puppy   , not by choice and one of my buds caught and broke off a small Pike 3 lb test line no match. I don't know were the big Perch are. Maybe not in yet, thats my excuse."
