288636,Bob Devine,2009-01-06 23:24:00,251,"DiggyJ, I would think that some of the Quinte stores should have them. Skevy's, Carra' or Gagnon's and Fishing World possibly. But the best spot to make sure you find a copy is is onlline: http://www.precisionangling.com/ "
288688,PERCHER,2009-01-07 00:26:00,787,Thanks to that  book we hooked many of eyes on Quinte this fall and on Erie as well. It's a must have for trollers. Dan
