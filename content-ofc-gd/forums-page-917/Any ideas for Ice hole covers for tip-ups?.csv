288259,farsider,2009-01-06 02:06:00,456,"I want to make or buy an ice hole cover/insulator for my tip-ups.  I have seen a version online by HT, but I have yet to see one in a store near T.O.  Outside of buying the Polar-therm style of tip-ups, or continually clearing the ice from the holes, what do you guys use? Or have you seen something similar in any shops?  Cheers, Mark"
288260,Roy,2009-01-06 02:18:00,13728,Get the Frabill round tip-up...you'll be glad you did.
288336,brifishrgy,2009-01-06 09:07:00,559,"I havent used my tipup in a while but plan on it next week for those pike that keep biting my line off ... I am going to cut a piece of 1"" foam to cover the hole and cut a slit in it to fit the tipup shaft .. it should work ... hopefully the fish will cooperate"
288391,ketchenany,2009-01-06 13:43:00,3229,I've used the covers that come with the five gallon pails that I get my grapejuice from. Used the green or red ones so they can be seen in the snow. And if they happen to freeze in they can take quite he beating in getting them out.
288476,DANIMAL,2009-01-06 17:56:00,215,A buddy of mine runs a portable bubbler in his holes to keep them from freezing. It works great but batteries get expensive.
288490,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-06 18:28:00,10439,a 5 gallon pail lid with styrofoam SM glued to it and a slot cut in it for the tipup.
288506,solopaddler,2009-01-06 19:32:00,8605, That's pure genius.
288524,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-06 20:21:00,0,I've never seen a bought item myself for that purpose but I have seen the 5gal Lip and SM work very well. :
289002,farsider,2009-01-07 17:13:00,456,"Thanks for the ideas thus far.  The SM and cover sounds workable.  I had actually read a tip from Gord Pyzer in some Ice Fishing mag that he put mineral oil in the hole to prevent freezing.  I was unsure of the environmental impact of doing so.  (Like salting a boat ramp late in the season)  I was looking at my nieces interlocking multi-coloured foam puzzle play floor, and thinking I could cut a couple of those to use.  Cheers, Mark"
