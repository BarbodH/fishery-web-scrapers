287603,rbaquial,2009-01-04 08:11:00,968,"Hey Folks,  I've used VANISH and other FLOUROCARBON lines, but then came across SPIDERWIRE's ULTRACAST INVISI-BRAID at BPS that is BRAID; Immediately thought, WHAT?! My 1st impressions were - ""How can this stuff be invisible underwater, its not 'Clear' ...its 'White'? ... Can anyone attest to this product? I really like the idea of INVISIBLE BRAID, but the fact its not 'CLEAR' kinda makes me skeptical. PLEASE! I need peoples INPUT!  Here's the link to their product: http://www.spiderwire.com/prod.php?k=74406...&u=SUIB-125  Thanks, Rob"
287612,singingdog,2009-01-04 12:17:00,1047,"It's certainly not invisible, but neither is Vanish. It's a good braid, but I prefer Power Pro."
287657,kemper,2009-01-04 16:37:00,2232,"Invisible is a hoax, dunk any fishing line in a glass of water and you will see it *GASP*  Not sure about the line, but I also like PP"
287692,rbaquial,2009-01-04 18:23:00,968,"Well, I know its not COMPLETELY invisible, it only SEEMS invisible because of the light refraction - but what I'm asking is, does that stuff work as great as VANISH, POWER-PRO ETC?....."
287792,Markystang,2009-01-04 23:37:00,131,Probably similar to Fireline Crystal I would guess.... More translucent than clear.
287908,ehg,2009-01-05 04:16:00,2666,"Actually found the red Power Pro to be difficult to tie in lower light conditions, the line kinda 'disappeared' compared to mono."
288050,BillM,2009-01-05 18:40:00,17367,"It's only line.  Put the lure infront of a hungry fish and you could be using rope and it wouldn't make much of a difference..    Visibility under the water isn't really a concern, I worry more about knot strength and the ability to get out giant birds nests  :)"
288354,singingdog,2009-01-06 11:35:00,1047," OK...I don't like it as well as PowerPro. I don't think it handles as well and seems a little more finicky for knots. I would take it over Vanish any day, but I am not a Vanish fan. I can't think of one advantage Vanish has over line costing far less."
