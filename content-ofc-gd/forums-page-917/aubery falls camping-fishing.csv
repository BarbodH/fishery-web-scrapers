288254,pike slayer,2009-01-06 01:55:00,1177,"its always an awesome time up there. we went up 5-6times this year and this was the only time we actually took pictures! there is the big lake down the road with pike, lake trout, and white fish then theres ponds all over with specks. their property back there has 2 private speck ponds on it. every time we go we catch 50 plus pike in a day there. and when the specks are biting its a feast! i hope to make it up there atleast once this winter and will probably post it. also i'm definitly in for a couple trips next year!"

288422,Leecher,2009-01-06 15:13:00,7832,Great report and pics pike slayer  Looks like paradise up there    and good times partying  Thanks for sharing Leechman
288581,pike slayer,2009-01-06 21:57:00,1177,"it definitly is a slice of paradise. i would love to buy a little chuck of crown land up there and build a small camp, is it possible to buy crown land?"
288591,Dano,2009-01-06 22:19:00,719,"Looks like a blast. Dont know about buying the crown land, but you may look at leasing some. Write the MNR and see what they say, you never know."
288594,Clampet,2009-01-06 22:21:00,1947," Have a gander, youg'un.. http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=Bu...earch&meta="
288598,irishfield,2009-01-06 22:25:00,26272,"All land sales of Crown land, on any natural reproducing lake trout lake, are currently frozen in Ontario. You can still purchase shore allowances for your existing property... but they will not sell any crown land on natural laker lakes to ANYONE... including municipalities... right now."
288624,pike slayer,2009-01-06 23:07:00,1177,"ya i dont wanna be right on the big lake. i wanna be back in the bush like my buddys camp there, just beside a speck pond. anything against that?"
288671,irishfield,2009-01-06 23:58:00,26272,"  As long as it's not a laker lake... they'll probably consider it. I think they have pretty much stopped giving out LUP's (Licenced Use Permits) but they are still selling crown land... at ""fair market value"". I'll dig for my links and add them... as I'm dealing with the MNR right now on purchasing a shore allowance.  Pulling up my old link didn't work so I searched. New website says MNR not actively selling crown land anymore etc... Still leasing...  http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on.ca/clupa.html  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/Crown...L02_176761.html  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/Crown...L02_176757.html"
