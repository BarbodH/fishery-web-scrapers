125606,ccmtcanada,2007-10-22 13:02:00,7971,Nice video...I count it as landed as long as you touch it.  I had my first ever steelhead do that to me last spring...I always have a net with me now.  Looked like a good sized fish!

125893,Parisite,2007-10-23 03:29:00,66,"Hahahahahahaha!  Fishing with 2 rods (I'm not sure that's legal from land), targeting a species that you don't know how to handle and not having a net with you?  That reminds me of the Trailer Park Boys...All I was tryin' to do was have a nice cheeseburger picnic and it got all f*cked up!  I loved the commentary at the end and how the video got cut off just like the fish!  Classic!"
