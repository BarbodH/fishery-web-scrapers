125383,Paulus,2007-10-21 13:24:00,522," He's still young. Talented (and published), but young. He's very good at hanging over your shoulder if he thinks you've got the best spot, which is the mark of a young fisherman - ""outta my way, cause I gotta catch 'em all NOW!"" He and his buddies still owe me a pic from last year, so I'm a little bitter.  Now, THAT was a pic I'd like to see posted  p.-"
125408,TroutSlayer,2007-10-21 15:00:00,64,"  Nope, who's Nater?"
125701,Nater,2007-10-22 18:46:00,68,Ya I guess your right I should be posting pictures of every single fish so that I can come to a board mostly full of people who have not the slightest idea on how to steelhead and get my ego boost to reassure myself that im good at fishing.  I think it's pathetic that at 30+ years old you feel that you have to certify your skills by posting pictures of 3lb fish 6 different angles and then challenge a 17 year old who should be looking for an ego boost to say he isn't catching fish because he isn't posting pictures.  As far as Paulus' statement it was the BEAVER cleary myself and the other 8931572395 people must have greased you out...considering in the picture we can clearly see that there is plenty of space between us.  But your right IM an idiot    Nate  Didnt see this till today as I was down in the states hammering on BIG steelhead with my buddies...here's a couple pictures of many fish. I'd like my hero cookie please     
125705,snag,2007-10-22 19:07:00,1932,"Nice catches there solopaddler.  Good to hear that ""nate"" has no ego.  Sorry Nater-the-deflater Highjacked your thread.  He might secretly love you?"
125711,aniceguy,2007-10-22 19:18:00,1094,"LOL remember seeing Nate as an 11yr old drifing these rivers, always a polite kid and never rude"
125712,solopaddler,2007-10-22 19:20:00,8605," I don't ""think"" his comments were directed at me, if they were who cares? Nate is young and has some growing up to do that's obvious...."
125713,Gerritt,2007-10-22 19:20:00,6129,   WOW... there I am in the background in Blue.. and my buddie Steve is just beyond me... I remember that day well.  I like the pose the guy behind you is making.. number 1??  Gerritt.
125714,Headhunter,2007-10-22 19:22:00,5703,"Nice fish Solo! I always enjoy your reports! I don't get why some folks insist on insulting others, while off handedly promoting themselves? Nater, perhaps you should have posted your own thread to show us your catch? You obviously wanted us to see it! They are really only fish, whether your obsessed with them or not, they are just fish! Keep'em comin Solo! Your a class act and I'm sure if a pole was taken as to who the members here would like to fish with, you'd be near or at the top! It's just a fish for cryin out loud! HH"
125725,Nater,2007-10-22 19:48:00,68,As if I could care less that you guys saw I caught fish...I'd rather keep everythign underwraps then showing the loogan circus where the fish are on.  I love how Dmasse acts like a 2 yr old and everyone here comes running to protect him.  I suppose you have to protect your own  and incase your interested DMASSE I fish 7 days a week...I guess we wouldn't call that logging time on the water?  Nate
125728,solopaddler,2007-10-22 19:59:00,8605," Thank's HH, although it's not really an insult. If it was directed at me from one of my peers, well then, different story.  Now, I'm going to add some thoughts to this post 'cause I have a feeling that it's not going to die. I've been a member of this board for a few years, but became a really active participent less than    a year ago. Why? Well, last year there was a ""somewhat"" similar thread except it was myself directing the comments towards Gerritt. I don't think my comments were too harsh, but nevertheless I had an epiphany of sorts and realized that whether I was right or I was wrong was irrelevant. The fact was I was acting like a jackass  . I made up my mind to not be so condescending and attempt to become a more active member. Why? Is it because I ""like to have my ego stroked"" or need a ""hero cookie""? No, it's simply because it's fun and no other reason. I'm in front of this stinkin' computer here at work for 2 separate 16 hour shifts and let me tell you if it wasn't for OFC I'd be bored silly. (I have a fairly stress free job  ) I still only post a fraction of the fishing I actually do, and with the exception of extremely remote areas or fly-ins you still won't see me name a location.... I've also experienced criticism from various people because of some of my posts. I've learned to shrug it off. Perhaps Freud might speculate that such a critical person is entirely too convinced of his own place in the universe and more specifically that perhaps his entire sense of self worth is wrapped up in his ability to be a good angler. In the words of Seinfeld that is ""Quite lame!"" Me? I have nothing to prove to anybody and will continue to post on this board as I see fit.  cheers,  Mike"
125731,snag,2007-10-22 20:04:00,1932," Dang, that could be a great signature!"
125732,aniceguy,2007-10-22 20:08:00,1094,"well put Mike,  Your a class act...  personally I suck monkey butt at fishing lol I just come here to see all the hot chicks in the avatars and wanna know how I can get a few of em"
125733,snag,2007-10-22 20:10:00,1932," douG can give you the link to my avatar, perv."
125738,Gerritt,2007-10-22 20:44:00,6129,"  Mike, I did not find your comments regarding my post last year harsh at all.. it was your opinion and you were entitled to it. nor did I jump down your throat over it either... Infact I valued your insight and I still do. Keep posting whatever you want to share and to hell with the naysayers...  I am still laughing at buddy giving the finger in the above pics and I was there behind him howling!  great times on the river!  PS.. Critic (sp?) me more... it might help me catch more fish!  Gerritt."
125741,FUSION,2007-10-22 20:57:00,81,"Paul, you in the background of that picture is priceless buddy!"
125747,Whopper,2007-10-22 21:12:00,2174,Unbelievable how some of these reports turn out to be a pi$$ing contest. This is exactly why some won't post reports here anymore. Always enjoy your reports Mike keep them coming.  Cheers  Whopper
125749,solopaddler,2007-10-22 21:17:00,8605," Well that's cool then...glad to hear there's no lingering hard feelings.  And yeah, you're right about Paul (he's a good friend).  I had NO idea he did that!     Ditto to you too buddy, LOL! Wow, this post is bringing everyone out of the woodwork  . Nice avatar pic BTW, that was one heckuva trip wasn't it?"

Then again maybe he wouldn't as there was no net back then  Natester get over it nothing you say will make any difference..."
125860,Gerritt,2007-10-23 01:30:00,6129,"  And nothing you say here will have ANY bearing on the relationships Mike has made on OFC he is a WELL respected member on this board well before you came on with your 2nd post..... I was on the river the day Nate was... and HE is one of the reasons I feel the way I do about the so called purists.. he was there with 4-5 other guys all posing for the camera when fighting a fish..and I mean posing like he was a darn supermodel... they were tromping up and down the river screwing up other people drifts.. in general a PITA...  with all his years of experiance... he has alot to learn in the way of respect...  Ohhh yeah and BTW...  That really is me in the background.. laughing my ass off at him, as others give him the finger... saw it all day long from numerous anglers...  Gerritt."
125868,Nater,2007-10-23 01:51:00,68,"Gerrit how many bows did you catch that day? 4 MAYBE? Face the facts you got whooped by a 17 yr old.  I love the ""stay strong"" as a group mentality here what a joke.  Me and oen other guy were there and I have a whopping total of 6 pictures from that day.  I guess that makes Mike and I on the same level as supermodels along with you? I seem to recall you posting pictures from that trip on this site  talk about calling the kettle black  Nate"
125871,irishfield,2007-10-23 01:55:00,26272,Nate...I hear your momma calling you for beddy bye time....
125872,Nater,2007-10-23 01:56:00,68,quick everyone to the OFC bandwagon...loogans unite!
125878,Roy,2007-10-23 02:08:00,13728,"Nate, you really must mature a little. You're probably very good at what you do but hey, you're too good for us. Go spin your center pin.....You've insulted enough people already. We're not that kind of a family Bud. We look after each other. Good luck ambushing fish in 20 foot wide tribs trying to get up the rivers to spawn. Sorry Nate, that's how I feel. Oh BTW your accolades might want to step down also."
124843,solopaddler,2007-10-19 12:03:00,8605,"Tis the season folks Headed north with a friend yesterday to fish again and man was it tough compared to last weekend! Right now with the rivers so low it really is a game of timing, if you don't get any rain it's going to be tough sledding. Weather forecast was originally calling for a bit of rain overnight and some more during the day yesterday. As it turns out we didn't get any rain and had to scratch and claw for the few fish we got... Still, a great day to be out and the few fish that were caught were full of fight.        cheers,  Mike"
124846,fatherof3,2007-10-19 12:05:00,1769,"some nice ones there,congrats"
124849,Nater,2007-10-19 12:19:00,68,so 6 pictures 2 different fish?  Nate
124852,lew,2007-10-19 12:22:00,12767,"Some nice fish there Mike, considering the tough conditions.  I heard the long range forecast is calling for less precip than normal for the rest of the fall, so things may not get any better in the near future.  Course, you being a weather dude, you already knew that"
124855,solopaddler,2007-10-19 12:26:00,8605," What difference does it make kid? If you're that concerned about it we landed a grand total of 5 fish between the two of us, rolled a couple more and hooked and lost a couple more one of which was quite large and snapped my tippet... Those were the pic's that happened to be on my camera."
124856,mattyk,2007-10-19 12:28:00,2110,some nice pictures thanks for sharing.
124857,solopaddler,2007-10-19 12:31:00,8605," Thanks Lew, and yeah you're right about the weather, it doesn't look too promising long range. I'm headed back this weekend for an overnighter with a good friend and his two young boys aged 8 and 9. He's been trying to pin me down for a while now to help him take his boys steelheading and this is the weekend. Based on how things went yesterday I think it'll be a blue eyed miracle if the boys get anything, but we'll giver 'er a go and you never know...."
124861,tonyb,2007-10-19 12:54:00,1637,"Hmm...you sure you didn't just find someone else's digital camera with pictures on it and post those?  Some very clean looking fish, good work.  Tony"
124868,Roy,2007-10-19 13:10:00,13728,"Great report, Mike. Beauty pics too. Steelhead is one of those fish that look tasty just as is y'know? Glad you enjoyed the day."
124869,blaque,2007-10-19 13:17:00,2419,"Love the look of a shiny, midsize female. Just georgeous fish. They almost look like they belong in saltwater. Waiting for my time down here, till then its slow days on the piers so far"
124870,Jay T,2007-10-19 13:19:00,282,"Beauty fish there Solopaddler. All these posts you have been doing really makes me want to get back into river fishing. I used to do a lot but don't know of to many places around me that I can access without getting into trouble with land owners, since I moved in May. I also have a hard time juggling hunting and fishing this time of year, I usually choose hunting.  Good luck this weekend."
124873,Riparian,2007-10-19 13:24:00,269,Please limit your pictures to one per fish caught.  
124875,Terry,2007-10-19 13:29:00,14456, say what   maybe everyone should post their personal rules as to not upset them  I know the board rules but I don't know all the personal rules..makes it hard to know what to do....LOL
124897,tbayboy,2007-10-19 14:34:00,1497,Pics like that make me want to take up fly fishing.  Great stuff.
124922,Whopper,2007-10-19 16:35:00,2174,Nice fish Mike THANKS FOR SHARING!  Funny stuff Terry
124946,skz,2007-10-19 17:23:00,15,"Thanks for the report Solo. Your right those gbay fish sure are spunky for their size, Great to see you had a good time with a friend despite the low water conditions. Take Care  Low Drifter"
125004,Milty,2007-10-19 21:18:00,121,"Sweet Report and nice Pics..ALL OF THEM,...with beauty fish like that,...I would love to see 5 angles of each one...lol..seriously though...tuff go this year so far for sure....were u by chance very close to the mouth of the pareticular trib you were on?  cuz up river I havent seen hardly any chrome off G-bay tribs yet this year!!!"
125013,Darek,2007-10-19 21:49:00,20,"Milty, try the mouth of the beaver river, you might be suprised!"
125015,Jigger,2007-10-19 21:53:00,1237,"Stubby heads on the steelies up there, eh? Real clean looking fish. Congrats, the bites tough with all the low water."
125027,irishfield,2007-10-19 22:34:00,26272,Anyone remember Nater's last post?  Beauty fish Mike and great to get out on a GBay trib. Maybe next time take the kid and he will cover the gas and show you how to really do it...
125130,DMASSE,2007-10-20 12:26:00,420,"WAIT I THOUGHT NATE WAS A EXPERT WITH TONS OF HOURS ON THE WATER he sould be posting or CATCHING fish right now, I know the real steelheaders are....  LETS SEE YOUR PICS  just my 2cents worth  Dave"
125144,007,2007-10-20 13:47:00,537,Nice steelies mate.  They're such a beautiful looking fish - the more pictures the better in my opinion - I enjoy seeing fish like that from all angles!  Good job 007
125151,Rainbow nut,2007-10-20 14:04:00,3,  Most steelhead fishermen are a slightly strange breed. They are highly protective of their fishery which is a limited and increasingly stressed resource. That's why you'll find 99% won't post on internet boards....  Here in Ontario rivers are getting increasingly crowded. Part of the solution to spread the numbers around would be for more Ontario fishermen to utilize the US fishery. Outstanding fishing in New York State and not such a long drive. Some of the bigger Erie tribs are amazing. What I'll do next week is get together a detailed summary of access to the better NY rivers with clear directions from Ontario. I'll also give the scoop on licenses and directions to some but not all the best access points. You'll have to work a bit of it out for yourselves  I would encourage local fishermen to check out some of these rivers. I'm here to share which is what these boards should be all about and forgive me in advance if I don't post details of a couple of my favorite on my doorstep rivers
125167,Riparian,2007-10-20 15:07:00,269, Thats not what DMASSE was implying. He wasant accusing you of not telling us where you catch trout.  'nuff said
125232,addict,2007-10-20 21:26:00,475,nice chrome.i always get jealous when i see your steel reports u have surely honed your skills well.good job.
