125332,blizzcat,2007-10-21 03:24:00,92,"hi all! Just some questions about Lake Nipissing, I've heard it's a really nice lake to fish in and I was wondering what it is like for December 14-16?? I'm looking to go up for that weekend maybe.. but I'm wondering if i should look for a cottage and boat rental, or for an ice fishing package.. (i'm a broke student and am browsing various packages/deals and such) Does anyone know that area at all?? Thanks in advance!  "
125336,irishfield,2007-10-21 03:28:00,26272,see Randy's post below
125342,blizzcat,2007-10-21 04:05:00,92,well that's strange.. i was looking at cottages and some had rates for ice fishing starting in december...
125373,Muskieman,2007-10-21 12:29:00,2472,Walleye is closed as of october 15th... pike & muskie and coarse fish are opened till december 15th ...Nipissing will re-open on January 1st...the regulations have been ammended it's too bad you could'nt hold off for an extra month the ice is good by then..
125392,irishfield,2007-10-21 14:08:00,26272,"I forgot you have to go on-line, on the MNR site, before you fish to see what this weeks rules are. Deleted the regs from the paper issue from my post above..."

125450,irishfield,2007-10-21 20:52:00,26272,"Okay..now I gotta make sure Randy was indeed correct. This is what I dug up ! Also the only time I've ever seen a season on Sunfish! ................... On Lake Nipissing (division 27) and the West Arm of Lake Nipissing (division 15) some fishing seasons have been extended to provide increased angling opportunities. In addition, the ministry has also changed the quota for some species in the West Arm to be consistent with those in the rest of Lake Nipissing. See tables below for details.

125452,Musky or Specks,2007-10-21 20:57:00,2710,No its just what I would recommend for a beginner. You can fish in the whirlpool from shore using roe or minnows and have success but from your first post it sounded like you were newbies and unless you have all the right equipment Im not sure of your success.
125453,Guest skeeter99,2007-10-21 21:01:00,0,"there is nothing in season on nipissing in december guys   here is the link to the mnr site with species and dates of opening and closings, slide down half a page and READ the chart  http://publicdocs.mnr.gov.on.ca/View.asp?D...chment_ID=25944"
125539,Greencoachdog,2007-10-22 02:13:00,8163, What about Catfish and Carp???
125570,blizzcat,2007-10-22 06:34:00,92, i am def. a beginning and have no equipment.. lol my boyfriend is quite good but hasn't fished Niagara yet and i know he has an 8weight for salmon but he doesn't have an extra for me or anything..  Thanks for the replys so far everyone!
125715,KD JOHNCOX,2007-10-22 19:23:00,1,"Hi: I'm a long time cottage owner and quite familiar with the fishing, rentals.... December is a bit of a down time for the lake and with the warmer Decembers we have had ice is usually unpredictable. There are great ice fishing opportunities at the southern end of the lake with several guys offering ice bungalows that include accomodation for 6-8, TV, DVD, tounge & groove pine interior, propane fireplace, picture window, bbq, heated outhouse, bait, tip-ups, transportation to and from shore...  Yep, just a step above your rec.room! I think you can find them at southshorelakenipissing, one is called Anglers Haven and the newest (with top of the line equipment and a great host-Paul) is www.sbaybungalows.ca. If you are looking for more info let me know. Enjoy, Kent"
125727,bigfish1965,2007-10-22 19:58:00,3382," No..there's lots of shorefishing opportunities, but if you want to be pretty much guaranteed fish, I would definitely get a charter."
