Good news was we got decent numbers (4 boated) including my Dad's first Musky.    Sadly, my streak of six days targeting Musky while boating at least one fish each day was broken on the last day as we wore the collar.  Not much for size either.....      Here is a pic of my Dad with his first baby Musky.      Next, Iceguy raised a couple of pretty fish.       Lastly, Karma was good to me as I caught this beauty.       Hope to do it again next fall!     SS."

126192,Roy,2007-10-24 01:14:00,13728,Thanks for the report. Congrats to your dad on his first muskie. The Ottawa is one of the finest rivers in the world for muskie.
126196,iceguy,2007-10-24 01:19:00,341,"Thanks for the fun weekend Rod, I'm in for sure next year. Loved the cottage/river.   I'll piece together a video in the next couple of days."
126220,jediangler,2007-10-24 03:20:00,1923,Well done. Sometimes I think I enjoy helping someone else get their first musky more than catching one myself. Congrats to your Dad on his first.
126242,lew,2007-10-24 08:57:00,12767,"That's a great way to spend a couple days and WTG on the fish, specially your dads 1st.  The Ottawa is indeed an excellent musky river and I've fished it 3 years in row now myself, and will be back again next year, and the next, and......."
