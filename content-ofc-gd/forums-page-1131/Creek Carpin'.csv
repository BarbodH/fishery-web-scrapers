125770,Rich,2007-10-22 22:31:00,3927,"Well I just got the one today. Fished a spot I haven't fished since I was a kid and lo and behold right there at my feet was this girl. Fighting them in the creeks sure is a rush, especially when they go for the overhanging trees, logjams or rockpiles.    Still determined to find a 20lber in the Mighty Lynn!"

125859,Gerritt,2007-10-23 01:22:00,6129,would have been a better pic if sugarpacket/Splenda was holding it! LOL nice bottom feeder man!  Gerritt.
125875,007,2007-10-23 02:06:00,537,Nice carp Rich.  It's amazing that you can get carp of that size from a creek.  Those river carp sure are long and thin compared with the fat heavyweights from Lake O.  Good job - good luck in the search for that twenty!  007
