125545,Guest lundboy,2007-10-22 03:19:00,0,Congrats....  Now you will find out just how long winter is!
125560,Mike the Pike,2007-10-22 04:15:00,3421, Good one Lundboy.  Carole and Cliff congrats on your new purchase now let the trolling begin. Can't wait to see your first fishing report in her.  MTP
125563,mooseroo,2007-10-22 04:25:00,80,Congrats! I'm jealous! I'm shore-bound for at least one more year but it's high on the priority list.  I like the wall-to-wall carpet idea. Looks cozy!  Good luck on'er!
125592,Spiel,2007-10-22 11:38:00,9065,"....Congratulations Cliff and Carol, fine looking vessel. I hope she brings you many days of pleasure. Gerritt had called me to see if I could come up the hill and join yous for the afternoon and as much as I would have liked to I was unable. My loss, sure would have been nice to chat with you both again."
125608,ccmtcanada,2007-10-22 13:19:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  We are pretty excited...just need that trailer!  We've had lots of people looking out for us and I'm hoping that I can go and pick that boat up this weekend.  I've noticed a few themes emerging from this thread so far so I thought I'd comment on them....  1)  We will NOT give up shore fishing.  Most of our fishing is done during the week and we only have 2 hours....so the boat will be a weekend thing for us. 2)  Thanks everyone for the ""leave some fish in the lakes"" for us comments...but quite honestly, we SUCK at fishing from a boat....just ask Fishnsled....LOL. 3)  We are going to concentrate more on exploring lakes at first, to get an idea of what's there and how to catch them, so we are NOT expecting success right off the bat.  It took us a lot of hours and work to find shore spots and then catch the fish....we expect the same kind of work with a boat. 4)  ""Break out another thousand"" - LOL...love that acronym.  We'll spend a little at first...then once we have an idea of how to make fishing in it more comfortable, then the thousand will come out I'm sure....haha. 5)  I plan on getting a full tune up before taking it out anywhere....and also practising backing up in a parking lot....all great advice...thanks!  Spiel...would have been great to chat again....maybe next time!  Thanks again everyone...had LOTS of support from the board in this purchase.  We'll try to take it out at least once this fall before winterizing it....until then, it'll kill me to see it all winter long waiting for the ice to melt."
125609,Bitsmith2k,2007-10-22 13:27:00,396,congrats guys.. i'm jelous..
126131,Hedfish,2007-10-23 21:10:00,76,"Grats, guys! Maybe I'll bye one too next year."

125329,Douger,2007-10-21 03:13:00,116,"nice work, cliff!  i know you'll get a ton of use out of it."
125339,tizfun,2007-10-21 03:55:00,292,"Congrats on your new boat...  Hope we'll me on the water someday..  \  If you still need a trailer, I think someone on the Simcoe board or the Out of Doors board had one..  If non there try Kijiji site..  I'll keep a lookout ..  Tiz"

125343,Victor,2007-10-21 04:06:00,1609,congratulations!!! it's about time you 2 get a boat HAHA  really look forward to see all the open water reports!!
125346,HTHM,2007-10-21 04:38:00,4082,"I'm jealous, congrads on the new ride! If you have any intel on a 16' er pm me with it if you don't mind. BTW I have lots of room for outside storage if you need it. All it will cost you is use of a seat for an afternoon next spring."
125347,frozen-fire,2007-10-21 05:14:00,542,congratulations on the purchase! I hope to follow in your footsteps soon!  does this mean no more shore reports?
125356,Roy,2007-10-21 07:17:00,13728,Hey! Good on ya! Great deal too...all you need now is a coupla OFC decals to give her the professional look.
125357,motv8tr,2007-10-21 08:14:00,2587,Congrats you two!!!  Great deal! Nothing can stop ya now....not that anything did  Enjoy!  Maureen
125367,Shelley Cooper,2007-10-21 12:06:00,394,Congradulations... Nice to see the search is over and you found a great deal...  Can't wait for your reports...
125385,Dano,2007-10-21 13:38:00,719,"Congratulations folks! She looks like a capable machine for you and I know you'll get lots of use from her, well done."
125391,Jer,2007-10-21 14:01:00,1426,"Too bad I just traded my trailer in for a more appropriate model for my boat. It would have been perfect for that rig. All within the last couple years, I had replaced the wheels, bearings, bunks, lights, new paint, etc (just couldn't make it any bigger to fit my boat).  Gateway Marine gave me $400 trade-in value which was hard to pass up on a new $1449 2100 lb EZ-Loader.  Enjoy the new ride."
125409,JohnF,2007-10-21 15:04:00,3494,"There's a rumour about that all the Lake O. inshore fishies are hightailin' it for where the water's blue, and the Kawarthas' fish are freaking, bubbling something that sounds like ""Crap! Bly's afloat now?""  Methinks they'd all be safer staying within casting distance of shore whilst you get this new mobility outa yer systems.  You're lucky. I've floated the boat idea around here a few times lately. That's when a cold front sets in. I can't convince SWMBO I don't mean a big shiny candy apple bassboat with more horses than either of the cars, or perhaps both.  JF"
125421,John,2007-10-21 16:26:00,2956,Well done Cliff and Bly. Seems like a great deal. Now nowhere will be safe!  John
125424,solopaddler,2007-10-21 17:05:00,8605,Hey congrat's that's great!
125428,Whopper,2007-10-21 17:39:00,2174,
125440,Joey,2007-10-21 18:49:00,9122,That's awesome Cliff and Carole.  That is a nice looking boat for sure.  You will enjoy it more than you could ever imagine.  Way to go  Joey
125467,pigeonfisher,2007-10-21 22:29:00,696,"$250, has some rust but i have towed with it and it appears to be in fine shape."
125471,Gerritt,2007-10-21 22:49:00,6129,"Steve, can you slap up a couple pics for  em?  Ger."
125472,ccmtcanada,2007-10-21 22:51:00,7971, PM sent!  Thanks!
125475,wolfville,2007-10-21 23:29:00,396,"Congrates on the purchase.... I'm sure you'll put it in good use and many reports will be coming. Maybe because of the boat, the reports would be coming at a better time of the day so I don't need to stay up for them anymore ;-)"
125498,PERCHER,2007-10-22 00:27:00,787,Well Cliff and Carole congrats.I am happy to see that you got a good craft.You will get many of good years on the water with that rig.So let the memorys begin.And again congrats.Dan
125513,bassmastermike,2007-10-22 01:08:00,295,Congrats Cliff and Carol !!!! Now that your waterbound leave some fish in the lakes for us!! LOL  Boat looks great and can be fixed up cosmeticly you can find a lot of part on ebay for a good price thats where i found alot of parts and accessories for my bassboat project if you remember my post. Cheers
125542,redfin,2007-10-22 02:39:00,79,congrats!  I had a 16' mirrocraft years ago.  still kickn' myself for selling it.  solid boat.
125544,pigeonfisher,2007-10-22 02:56:00,696,"no pics...I am in PA and won't be up to the cottage for a number of weeks.  Cliff, PM me again, I will give you directions.  I am pretty sure it's an 1 7/8"" ball but don't remember for the life of me.  Take the boat to and and drop it in the dump on your way through.  Consider me out of commission until December.  If you need to do something before then I understand."
125294,SlowPoke,2007-10-21 00:40:00,2984,"Congrats Cliff and Carole! Can you give me the phone number for this guy, I need new carpeting in my living room! I like the seat bases. It appears they lock into the channel along the side of the bench and you can move from side to side as you wish. Neat idea allowing you to balance the boat with ease. It looks like a nice cover too. If you are willing to spend $895 for a new trailer, CAS Marine in Ayr (west of Cambridge) has several in stock. I'll have an eye out for used as well. -Brian"
125302,kennyman,2007-10-21 00:53:00,737,"Congratulations on the ""rad""ride. That's a great looking boat. Really nice and deep. Well. nowhere is safe now. When you guys were just shore fishing others could move away from the shore so they could catch fish too. Now that you have a boat they'll be no fish for the rest of us.  I've been looking too and just put a deposit on one of my own. Picking it up on Wednesday and I'll post pics then. Mine seems quite boring compared to yours though Cliff. Nice deal. Oh yeah .... save a few fish for the rest of us to catch please."
125303,BFSC Kevin,2007-10-21 00:53:00,1351,"Actually i agree with GCD.. backing up with a trailer needs some practicing.. maybe you want to try it out a bit in a parking lot before you try it for the first time at a launch...?  best of luck, kevin"
125304,Jacques,2007-10-21 00:54:00,97,"That's awesome, Cliff.  Can't wait to see the reports this generates..."
125312,taper,2007-10-21 01:41:00,611,"Congratulations Cliff. You have been carrying our team all year without a boat, I can't imagine what it will be like now."
125314,lookinforwalleye,2007-10-21 02:17:00,4399,Congrats on your new ride guys enjoy.  I was wondering since the rig is a early 80`s model I was wondering is that brown shag carpet she`s wearing?  LOL
