125459,keram,2007-10-21 21:49:00,585,"I plan to go fishing every weekend, but sometimes circumstances ( mostly weather ) put damper on these plans (wind this weekend did it for me )If it happens at this time of year I do not complain, because there is something else I like to do and is much cheaper then fishing, but provides almost the same kind of “thrill” for me. One of my non fishing trips.  Perfect for drying ( require some cleaning )    Dried already     Perfect for pickling     Pickled    And if you at the right spot at right time “mushrooming” can be very rewarding     And like in fishing a real TROPHY waiting to be found This my daughter’s “catch”  in fishing terms is an equivalent of 50”+ musky  "
125461,irishfield,2007-10-21 21:57:00,26272,Great stuff Keram...I've got a property covered in various mushrooms and puff balls...just terrified to eat the wrong one.
125463,bbog,2007-10-21 22:01:00,665,Wow great catch you got there - what is your drying and pickling process?
125466,Gerritt,2007-10-21 22:17:00,6129,Mmmmm.... Fried Puffballs!  Gerritt.
125536,Greencoachdog,2007-10-22 02:04:00,8163,  Go ahead Wayne... you'll only eat the wrong one once!
125546,Joey,2007-10-22 03:20:00,9122," Yep, when I found the morel in my yard, I was doing some research to find out if it was a true Morel and one website had this to say:  ""One of two things will happen to you when you eat a mushroom, you'll live or you'll die.""  Scared the crap out of me.  Looks like you know your shrooms Keram.  Way to go, looks like a cool hobby.  Joey"
125665,keram,2007-10-22 16:58:00,585," Wayne, like everything in life it require little bit of of knowledge, and it is not as difficult as it looks   Very simple: drying in oven like homemade beef jerky, pickling like pickled eggs with small variation of ingredients   Suillus (slippery Jack) and boletus ( I do not know english common name ). The best of the best     Whoever put this sentence on the website, has no idea what it is all about.   In few minutes I'm going to the woods again in. This weather is perfect  , I do not want to lose another opportunity"
