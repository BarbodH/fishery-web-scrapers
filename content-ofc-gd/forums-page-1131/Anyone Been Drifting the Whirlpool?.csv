Heading down for a night away with my lady and thought I meet sneak in a few drifts if it is worth the hike down to the water..Will be fishing from shore, first time there, any tips would also be helpful.  My plan was to drift roe and jigs deep with the CP and/or toss some hardware....thanks in advance!!!"
