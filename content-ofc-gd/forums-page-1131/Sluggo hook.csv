Since then I've had 2 of them kicking around the bottom of the tacklebox but nothing to rig them up with. Anybody know what size hook you rig them up with, the sluggos are around 9 or 10 inches long  if I recall correctly. I've checked Lebarons and Bass pro but haven't seen anything large enough. Any ideas? Thanks, Ross  P.S. Anybody use these with any luck for Musky?"

125579,FishHeadRic,2007-10-22 10:30:00,226,Here's a good article if you're finding it hard to locate  a hook in that size. I know Owner does make a 6ot that will fit a sluggo but this article show's ya an easier way to deal with em. http://www.stripersonline.com/Pages/Articl...hR_sluggo.shtml   FHR

125621,Weeds,2007-10-22 14:22:00,782,"A pile of good responses! Alright, thanks a bunch guys, and bridgnenorth tackle is a short drive  away from me too, been looking for an excuse to head back there.  And thanks for that number too Lew, I just gave them a ring and they've got them."
125622,fishnsled,2007-10-22 14:26:00,3520,"If you get down to Oshawa at any point in time, Gagnon's has them if Bridgenorth doesn't work out for ya."
125746,Weeds,2007-10-22 21:11:00,782,"Well, Bridgnenorth tackle didn't have them as it turns out, Got some size 5 eagle claw hooks that might work instead, maybe a little small but we'll see. I'll pop into Gagnons next time I'm passing through Oshawa as I've never been there before."
