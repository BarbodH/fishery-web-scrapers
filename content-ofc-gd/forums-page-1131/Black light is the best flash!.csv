117458,bassfighter,2007-09-25 19:58:00,366,"The black/blue light is actually so tiny only as thick as your normal pen and 3 inch in length, small enough to be added to our key chain. It is not bright like your normal Blue or white LEd light to shine on object, you can hardly use these black light to see where you are going, they are indeed UV rays, that worked with glow products.  The button batteries are also so small, I pressume it is very efficient in power consumption.  Eaby sells them as well, but the larger models,"
125554,Mike the Pike,2007-10-22 03:48:00,3421,I have not been able to pick up a black light none to be found out my way.  I did pick up this little gadget at BPS today.    Only $5.99 looks like it should do a fine job of lighting up the Glowy stuff. MTP
125561,mooseroo,2007-10-22 04:16:00,80," I did manage to put together 4 of the UV flashlights. They work really well and don't blind you when charging your lures. They can blind you if you look directly at the beam considering it's straight UV light... the same light that sunglasses are designed to protect your eyes from.  I didn't have to go over to Buffalo/Harbor Freight to get the white led flashlights. By sheer luck, I found them at Giant Tiger for $3.95 including three AAA batteries. I cracked off the plastic lens, and pushed out the reflector and the small circuit board. I cranked up the soldering iron and removed the factory LEDs and then soldered in the UV LEDs that I bought online. After some fiddling and gluing, I got the flashlights back together and they work like a charm.  The light is pretty concentrated and it's easy to charge up spoons. The charge is MUCH brighter than a camera flash charge and lasts a bit longer. I think there is a finite amount of time that the charge lasts depending upon the glow paint on the lures, regardless of the charging method. The Cleos last second longest in my collection of glow lures.  The longest is a larger (all be it much lighter) spoon that I bought at Tight Lines in Pickering. It's painted both sides and is surprisingly bright/long lasting. I need to add some weight to the spoon to give it casting distance (I think it's designed as a trolling spoon). I'll try the bent-quarter-glued-to-the-spoon trick. I'll also get the make and model next time I'm in Tight Lines.  I kept one  flashlight for myself and gifted the other three to my fishing buddies. If you see an ominous blue glue coming from an LED flashlight on your next trip down to one of the tribs, it might just be a ""UV LED Flashlight... of Death!!"""
125617,LeXXington,2007-10-22 14:13:00,1928,"Hey All.,  If your in Mississauga, (401 area) and want one, let me know.. I found a dollar store with a few.  YEAP for a buck!!!!  PM please"
125633,Oktravis,2007-10-22 15:13:00,62,I bought one of these from ebay it is the best thing for charging glow lures.there is tons of them out there  http://cgi.ebay.ca/AAA-21-LED-UV-VIOLET-FL...1QQcmdZViewItem  Ill never go back to the flash  Travis
125847,bassfighter,2007-10-23 00:59:00,366,"Try to buy the glow powder on ebay, they work better than most existing glow lures out there. I made some and they glow brighter after initial charge from a UV black light and the charge last longer too. You need to learn to work with the power for it is so fine and can waste easily  You can also apply the product on some crank bait or rattler. I ws lucky to but two ounce for 0.88 cents, the shipping cost is how the seller makes money, it only cost $1.50 stamp to ship it to me, but the seller charge me $7."
116438,bassfighter,2007-09-22 18:36:00,366,"I finally got my first black light from a dollar store, it works better than a camera flash, the results of the light intensity of a glow is more intense after shinning on it. Few dollar store carries them and it comes with 4 batteries as well. I got mine at a downtown dollar store by luck.  The color looks blue, but it is not a blue LEd light and hardly visible when shine upon regular object, but when one shines it on glow product, it glows very intensely. I tried shinning the normal LEd light and the black light on money, and it had different effect, normal light brightens the shined object, Black light shows all the mini hair and hidden inscription on the currency.  I have been using camera flash or LEd light for years and it works as well, but the black light has more UV rays, therefore works the best and one can shine on it for more seconds as well, but it does not make the object any more brighter."
116439,oncogene,2007-09-22 18:39:00,154,sounds good... gona check it out! Was it from Dollarama?
116445,Mike the Pike,2007-09-22 19:21:00,3421,same here .I want one can you let us know where to get one.thanks for the info.MTP
116446,bassfighter,2007-09-22 19:24:00,366,"Dollarama does not seem to carry them, some independent mom and pop store might carry it, the best is to call around before one shows up, I have been searching them since last year and they are hard to find. they are mainly use for checking authenticity of currency.  Due to the high UV content, should one go and buy some sunscreen lotion and some sunglasses? Only if we are dead serious in landing a salmon."
116447,ecmilley,2007-09-22 19:31:00,2163,"jeez looks like a have a new use for my black light i use for leak detection, that only cost me 80 bones high uv concentraion don't shine in your eyes"
116452,smokinall4s,2007-09-22 20:15:00,89,"great tip for glowing lures. As for blacklights, they shouldn't be to hard to find now that Halloween is coming. You'll just have to pay more than a buck for it. As for finding one at a dollarstore I'll tell my wife to keep an eye out for one, she loves dollarstores"
116462,hi09,2007-09-22 21:47:00,46,sorry a bit confused.... what is the blacklight for? if i am understanding correctly you shine it on a lure? how does that do anything? thaks
116500,wallyboss,2007-09-23 00:05:00,1095,Geez I had one of those in my basement when I was a teenager.!!! Oh no that gives away my age and my teenage pastime  :wacko:
116505,mooseroo,2007-09-23 00:17:00,80,"You shine it on glow-in-the-dark lures like the popular Little Cleo spoons. For fishing at night, the glowing lures are great for grabbing the attention of finicky fish.  You can use a flashlight or disposable camera flash, but apparently the black lights work better.  The hunt is on. If I find them I'll buy a couple for friends and then post the location here."
116663,bassfighter,2007-09-23 16:20:00,366,"Other anglers from anther site mentioned that some dollarama store carries them. The one I tried in Orfus, or Richmond hill major mac store does not carry them, Call ahead to save time."
116700,mooseroo,2007-09-23 19:49:00,80,I tried a few dollar stores in Ajax and Pickering today... nothing so far.
116718,mikeymikey,2007-09-23 20:20:00,376,i've looked at few stores around north york and non of them has it.  please share with us if you find some.
116733,Canuck2fan,2007-09-23 21:22:00,1444,I just checked a couple of indepedant dollar stores in my home town they said the lights will be in next week for Halloween as mentioned before but they aren't a dollar LOL.
116834,bassfighter,2007-09-24 02:23:00,366,"Try this store, the buck store just North of Lawrence on Jane, the one next to the Fish On Line fishing/bait/tackle shop/ Call other Dollarama store , some might have them. The laser like pen has nothing to do with Halloween, therefore I doubt if they will carry the proper one."
117103,oncogene,2007-09-25 00:11:00,154,"hum at first I kept thinking blacklight as those big lightbulbs u can get in HomeDepot etc. But now just realised.... is the dollarshop one basicaly a UV-LED tiny flashlights? Is that what we'r looking for, if so, how many LED bulbs are on each? coz i know where to buy them online... didn't realize that's the thing. Not $1 tho but cheap enough."
117259,blaque,2007-09-25 12:17:00,2419,Is this what were talkin about?  Blacklight
117264,ikoflexer,2007-09-25 12:43:00,10,"That's the right one.  They're UV LEDs, tiny, and intended for checking banknotes.  Don't ask for ""blacklight"" in dollar store, they won't know what you're talking about.  Ask about the tiny LED (blue light) flash light that you can check money with.  Got mine a few days ago at the buck store near Jane and Lawrence.  They had quite a few in stock, over 20 or so.  It works very well indeed, but I'm not sure they work better than an ultrabright LED."
117279,Rich,2007-09-25 13:48:00,3927,"I got one for free from my bank. Ironically, it has a picture of a fish on it. lol"
117300,mooseroo,2007-09-25 14:26:00,80,I ordered some UV LEDs to make a few of these 9 LED Flashlights of Death on the weekend (if they arrive by mail in time). I'm heading down to Harbor Freight in Buffalo on Friday to grab the flashlights themselves.  I'll let you know how they work.
117305,blaque,2007-09-25 14:43:00,2419,"Im in Buffalo and just called harbor freight, they also have the white LED keychain lights for $1.99. Doesnt sound like what were talkin about here though. Im confused lol She didnt say anything about a Blacklight. Just white LED. Think im just gonna head in there and check them out and bring a glow cleo in the store and tell them to shut the lights off lOL"
117310,blaque,2007-09-25 14:54:00,2419,"Hows bout this , found them at Walgreens for 3.99, they actuallly have a bunch of LED type lights for reading, night lights etc.  LED light"
117311,mooseroo,2007-09-25 14:55:00,80, They don't sell the blacklight/UV flashlight at Harbor Freight. They sell the white light LED flashlights. The link above is to instructions on removing the white LEDs and replacing them with UV LEDs. You have to do a bit of soldering to swap them out.
117316,blaque,2007-09-25 15:04:00,2419,"gotcha, thanks for the heads up"
117334,JorgeCarlos,2007-09-25 15:47:00,109,"I just bought couple at Jane&Lawrence dollar store,money detect"
117405,mooseroo,2007-09-25 18:06:00,80,"  If you can lock yourself in a closet with it and a Cleo, let us know how the Money Detect lights work. The original post was referring to the tube style blacklight I believe.  "
