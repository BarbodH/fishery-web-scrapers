125213,Musky or Specks,2007-10-20 19:34:00,2710,Im going to have to say tiger as well lightning like white stripes are a dead give away.
125434,Jigger,2007-10-21 18:12:00,1237,"Got it up in Haliburton Sinker. She was a beauty, for sure."
125510,Zib,2007-10-22 01:01:00,369, Why would you kill them? When all the walleye/perch guys in Lake St. Clair were crying about the musky eating all the perch & walleye they were telling people to kill any musky they caught. Nobody listened.
125511,Zib,2007-10-22 01:03:00,369,Here's a tiger musky that was caught in Lake St. Clair this year.  
125514,mattyk,2007-10-22 01:11:00,2110,They sure do make em pretty in LSC.
125515,Terry,2007-10-22 01:12:00,14456,"muskie are native to Balsam pike are not because of the types of lake most of the kawarthas are the muskie can not compete with the pike for spawning grounds and the muskie die off it has happened to all the lakes coming from lake simcoe, like canal lake and are now making their way to balsam, because of a man made canal system and the pike upset the balance so again I say  I will kill and eat any pike that show up in Balsam lake and would hope everyone else does the same"
125521,Rizzo,2007-10-22 01:20:00,4754,  here's a wee little baby tiger I got with coolB a few years ago
125523,Rizzo,2007-10-22 01:28:00,4754,  here's another tiger.  Fortunately both of these fish (little guy in previous post) were NOT from the Kawarthas.  Here's hopin I never get one there!
125534,mattyk,2007-10-22 01:55:00,2110,i agree with Terry. Pike are not native to the Kawarthas and they dont belong in there. The one that i caught a balsam this year i kept.
125562,Mike the Pike,2007-10-22 04:19:00,3421, Terry once again i admire your computer skills.How did you learn all that sheet.You must be in the printing industry.
125659,musky66,2007-10-22 16:40:00,273,"I have been fishing Balsam for about 7 years. Never seen a Pike until I caught a nice one last season. I always swore if I caught one there I would eat it but this was the greenest, prettyest Pike with orange fins I had ever seen- it is still swimming. Caught my first Tiger last year as well- beautiful fish. This year I have caught another pike and THREE more Tigers! I would say Pike and therefore Tigers are on the increase."
125692,Jigger,2007-10-22 18:17:00,1237,"Nice looking tigers, guys! Would it be out of the question to think that Tiger Musky would show up in numbers before pike if there is a lower density of pike and higher density of musky on any given bod of water?"
125698,Terry,2007-10-22 18:37:00,14456,"Mike the Pike...I am more a hammer  and nail kind of guy, when it comes to my job I learnt by hanging around this website and playing with the computer and photo editing software  I never learnt the right way to do things but I did find ways to get the results I want.....  all I did to make that effect was download a picture of a real tiger  copied it and paste it on top of the muskie then I stretched it to cover all of the muskie then I erased all the tiger that wasn't on the muskie then I viewed layers and I made the tiger about 50% transparent and  that was the results  piece of cake"
125700,Zib,2007-10-22 18:46:00,369," Tiger musky are the result of 2 male pike breeding with a female musky. Tiger musky grow faster than pike or musky but don’t reach the size of a regular musky. Male tiger musky don’t breed & female tigers usually don’t breed either but a very small percentage of them do. Since pike spawn before musky, you will see the pike population increase quicker than musky.  Here in Michigan the DNR stocks some inland lakes with tigers but those caught in Lake St. Clair occurred naturally from pike breeding with musky."
125740,Jigger,2007-10-22 20:49:00,1237,"I understand the reproductive side of how a tiger is made. What I was asking was...If theres a low density, say theres 5 pike in Balsam lake to 100 musky, sure the pike MIGHT end up in the same spawning bay. But if they're scattered, they might end up in 3 or 4 different areas that are good spawning sites.Of coure, in these bays you'd see the resident musky getting busy and the pike, looking for love, would get in on the action. If this happens, wouldn't you see a greater number of tigers before the pike start going? In subsequent years, you might see more and more pike as the density gets higher and pike spawning is more successful as a result of the higher density.  I'm no expert, I'm just trying to think in a linear fashion. Good conversation at any rate. Cheers."
122773,mattyk,2007-10-12 13:43:00,2110,"I caught a pike this summer in Balsam lake and it got me thinking that there must be some Tiger muskies in there. Has any one caught a tiger musky in the kawartha lakes? Is the MNR doing anything to stop the slow invasion of pike across the kawarthas. I remember when Canal lake use to have a musky fishery until the pike made it into that lake and now its a lake filled with hammer handles. Same thing with lake Dalrymple, there use to be some nice musky in that lake but then the pike made it in there and lots of hammer handles and very few musky left. I have heard the same with Elephant lake,  that pike have made it in there and the muskie fishery is declining."
122778,lew,2007-10-12 13:54:00,12767,"Matt, there's plenty of stories about tigers in the Kawarthas, but in over 50 years of fishing there I've never come across one myself yet, or even a pike for that matter, infact I don't even know anybody who's caught one.  I never could understand though, why the pike haven't migrated up the Trent and into the  eastern Kawartha Lakes. The Trent system is a direct hiway up from Lake O,  and the canal has been open for 100 years, so you'd think in all that time a few pike would find there way.  But let's hope they never do."
122782,ranger520vx,2007-10-12 14:32:00,164,"Lew, many years ago I recall reading about a Sonic Pike Barrier installed around Canal Lake that repels Pike migration further into Kawarthas. I tried to Google this but get nothing. Any MNR /Fleming types around to elaborate?"
122785,Fishnfiend,2007-10-12 14:41:00,357,"I have not caught, but have seen tiger muskies from a couple kawartha lakes.  They do exist (or at least did)."
122787,fishnsled,2007-10-12 14:41:00,3520,A buddy of mine had a 7 poundish pike on Balsam this past weekend and lost it at the boat.  He also had his first tiger muskie the week before all of about 3-4 pounds.  He wasn't sure if it was but the guy he was fishing with varified it.  I've heard of serveral pike being caught in Balsam but in my hundreds of hours on that body of water I yet to get one myself.
122789,lew,2007-10-12 14:43:00,12767,"Ranger, that sonic barrier near Canal may help stop the spread of pike from the western Kawarthas, but have you heard of anything in the east ?? I did hear of one down around Hasting to stop the gobies from moving north, but I think that one is fairly recent though.  I spose it's only a matter of time till the snot rockets make their way north"
122795,Terry,2007-10-12 14:56:00,14456,"I did hear gobies in rice now  I have yet to see pike in balsam and I do spend a good bit of time there each year  when pike showed up in canal, they exploded  for about 4 years you could not make a cast with out catching a 12"" to 20"" pike , if the lure had 3 hooks you would catch 3 at a time on some casts...and it changed to whole lake and not for the better, lets hope it doesn't happen else where and please kill any pike you catch in balsam"
122796,b2kptbo,2007-10-12 14:58:00,1505,"Was with a buddy about 8yrs ago and he got a good size Tiger, south side of Bridgenorth Causeway. Got a picture but not digital..."
122801,mattyk,2007-10-12 15:17:00,2110,i kept the pike that i caught on balsam. I didnt know they had installed a Barrier to keep the pike out.  That sounds like a good plan. I wonder if they will ever try to reestablish muskies in lakes like Canal or Dalyrmple similar to the lake simcoe project.
122819,Musky or Specks,2007-10-12 16:19:00,2710,Unfortunatly reintroduction of Musky just wouldnt be that successfull in the Kawarthas. Musky there evolved without pike for competition and act just like pike in their spawning behavior. There are actually two kinds of musky identified by their behavior. They are lacustrine and riverine. Simcoe had riverine musky that they lost due to loss of spawning habitat(offshore shoals). The Kawarthas have lacustrine musky which spawn on flooded shallow weeds and grass the same as pike. The pike spawn before the musky and the young pike chow down on the newly born Musky. You could introduce the riverine variety but a lot of the lakes in the Kawarthas just wouldn't have suitable spawning grounds and would be doomed to failure. Bad news Im afraid.
122858,Rizzo,2007-10-12 17:30:00,4754,"We have relatives on Balsam who tell us the frequency of pike being caught is very low, but is increasing.  I just started fishing there this year but I'll tell you now any pike that finds its way into my boat from Balsam will not be going back into the lake."
122894,Terry,2007-10-12 19:13:00,14456,love those tiger muskie       sorry ron  it is a joke
122896,lew,2007-10-12 19:23:00,12767,  But does your boss know how you spend your work days Terry ??
122897,misfish,2007-10-12 19:35:00,29133,Terry is the BOSS Lew.LOL Well he thinks he is.LOL  Thats a good one. I know Ron has a sence of humor.I think.
122901,Golfisher,2007-10-12 19:45:00,586,Nice kitty!
122905,fishnsled,2007-10-12 20:01:00,3520,"Nice job on the ""tiger muskie"" Terry!  lol!"
122915,Handlebarz,2007-10-12 20:33:00,3790,"WOW that tiger looks like it could be a new record judging from her markings I would say roughly 54""  congratz ron that one loks like she came from pigeion"
122917,Jigger,2007-10-12 20:54:00,1237,"I think that some of the pike that are in the Kawarthas could have made their way downstream, not up. There are pike in some of the lakes in Haliburton that perhaps could have followed the current toward the Kawartha lakes. I've been doing my best to keep them out of the water, but can only have so many Pike steaks. I take any I get under 30in.  I think I caught my first Tiger Musky this past weekend. I've been trying to get the pic loaded up, but my PC isn't allowing me to get any pics off my camera.  Water birds could carry eggs over as well, seeing as pike eggs are sticky. The eggs could get picked up in a spawning bay and transported to another waterbody when the bird brushes up against some weeds or branches."
122930,mistaredone,2007-10-12 22:05:00,913,"Elephant and Baptiste are rampant now with 1-2 pound pike.  I haven't hit a muskie under 33"" in a few years on those lakes."
122941,fishinfool,2007-10-12 23:18:00,366,"Been fishing Balsam since I was thirteen and have never heard of or caught a Pike there. I hope they never make it up to the highest lake on the Trent. Started fishing Crappies just two years ago on Balsam though, never knew they existed on our lake before then."
122976,jediangler,2007-10-13 04:10:00,1923,"We stopped holding our annual musky weekend at Elephant lake after going there from 1991 until 2000. During that time we caught many muskies and no pike. We had heard that they had a foothold in Baptiste lake so we knew it would only be a matter of time. In 2002 we caught 14 pike and no musky. I've seen several pics of tigers from both Elephant and Baptiste. If a tiger is what your after, these lakes could be your best bet."
125147,Jigger,2007-10-20 13:58:00,1237,"Finally got the pic of what I suspect is a tiger musky. Not the best, but it shows pretty distinct markings. I'll let you guys be the judge. Fish was a good size, close to 40in. Just had the spinnerbait in the side of the mouth, one hook so I released at boatside...  "
125195,mattyk,2007-10-20 17:47:00,2110,looks like a tiger to me.
125198,joonmoon,2007-10-20 18:27:00,528,Yup I'd say she's a toothy kitty. Nice shot at boatside too.
125204,Sinker,2007-10-20 18:35:00,8692,"Nice pic!!  I'd say that's a tiger for sure!! If not, its one hell of a nice looking musky!!  You got that in the kawarthas??  Sinker"
