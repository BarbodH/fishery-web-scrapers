125710,misfish,2007-10-22 19:17:00,29133,"A few years back I met up with Terry and he had this bass boat and I was always interested in fishing bass tourneys and always wanted to fish from a bass boat. Terry gladly accepted my invite on to his boat. From that day forward I was pretty much hooked on fishing bass from a bass boat and learned alot from him as I did from others on the tour.  Well the BARRIE BASS MASTERS had a fund raiser this past Sunday and I had asked Terry if he would partner up with me for this one. He was more then willing and I was excited to finally be able to get out and fish a tourney with him. As you most have seen my prefish on some areas of Simcoe had been very good. Ah, anyone thinking what Im thinking,  about  what my prefishing days have turned out to be on tourney day   :'(  Yep,I find the fish,I see the fish and I even catch a PB 6 pounder on one of these spots that held lots of fish and well,YEP they were not there come tourney day. Well there were two fish there,ok three ok four,but broke one off and lost the other, We spent a good 3 hours on this break but it seemed to be for not after awhile. With the wind being south.west I figured we could shoot out to a spot that would be wind protected in the big lake. Well we started off great,but once we got past BBP we hit those south rollers mixed with thos west waves and let me tell ya.I felt like we were in a washing machine. Well Terry did Im sure as I hit a well 4 footer that washed the boat and Terry. I looked over and all he said was,I WE THERE YET.   I remember when this happen to me in a single consol boat,but Im sorry my friend,I couldnt help but laugh. Thank goodness it was 22 degrees outside. Needless to say,we stopped, turned and headed back into the bay and finished the day fishing breaks and shorelines but the westerly gusts were just to much to really control. Gusts reached 25-30 and that is not fun.  Concidering the day and that my prefish was awesome we managed 2 fish for 8.50 pounds. Not bad for a two fish day. The winner as you can see had an awesome day. He braved the big waters and was rewarded. BTW this was a 4 fish limit.If it was a five,Curtis had a chance of breaking the 30 pound record .   Thanks again Terry for the time out there and excepting my invite. Great guy and great fishing partner.   Now some may have noticed I have my boat up for sale. I have reached my fulfillment of the bass tourney thing. I have filled my dream as far as experinceing the tourney side of it and am going to be getting back into a tinny with down riggers and I,ll still be fishing the odd little tourneys but just not from a bass boat.   It,s been a blast and a dream satisfied as far as I am concerned.  RESULTS, LAKE SIMCOE OPEN, OCTOBER 21, 2007. PLACE ANGLERS BASS B.F.

This was a 4 fish tournament and many anglers had difficulty catching all four fish. Although the weather was unusually warm for late October, the winds started to blow before noon and made life difficult. A total of 44 fish were weighed in weighing 172 lb for an average size of 3.91 lb Every fish was a smallmouth. MNR staff as well as people from Queen's University were on hand to tag and take scale samples before the fish were released. I will post pictures of the sampling process under conservation in a few days.  As you can see the day started out perfect.   My partner       The two for the day    I have one more tourney this upcoming weekend. It,s the first BPS Open. This will cap off my dream."
125718,Headhunter,2007-10-22 19:33:00,5703,"Great story Misfish! I love the shot of Terry holding the hand rail before you even hit the nasty water... perhaps Terry has some ""Kreskin"" in him!LOL Thanks for taking the time! HH"

125729,Terry,2007-10-22 20:00:00,14456,"I had a great time fishing was tough and the wind was tougher  you just can't describe what it feels like to have a wall of water hit you like it did.. one of us, not me, had a windshield to protect them (somewhat) I was wearing my good rain suit and it did not protect me I was wet from head to toe..I have never been that wet while having a bath, that's how wet I was.. I had the hood up and I bet 10 gallons of water went in the hood and down my front and back inside the rain suit, we will not even try to talk about my wet butt... but it was nice and warm and the 50k gusts of wind dried me out pretty quick  thanks for the invite Brian I had a blast Terry"

Glad to see you and Terry had a great time out there, despite the unplanned bath!! LOL."
