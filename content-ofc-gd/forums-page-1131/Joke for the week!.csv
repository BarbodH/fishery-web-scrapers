One morning the husband returns after several hours of fishing and decides to take a short nap. Although she isn't familiar with the lake, the wife decides to take the boat. She motors out a short distance, anchors, and continues to read her book. Along comes the game warden in his boat. He pulls up alongside her and says,""Good morning, Ma'am, what are you doing?"" ""Reading my book,"" she replies, thinking isn't that obvious? ""You're in a restricted fishing area,"" he informs her. ""But officer, I'm not fishing. Can't you see that?"" ""Yes, but you have all the equipment. I'll have to take you in and write you up."" ""If you do that, I'll have to charge you with rape,"" says the woman. ""But I haven't even touched you,"" says the game warden. ""That's true, but you do have all the equipment."" MORAL: Never argue with a woman who reads.
