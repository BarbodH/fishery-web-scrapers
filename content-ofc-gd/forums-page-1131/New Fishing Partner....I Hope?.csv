125684,Kirk,2007-10-22 17:49:00,347,"I thought you had 'other' news, from the title.  Congrats, looks like a nice pup."
125739,fishfarmer2,2007-10-22 20:48:00,76,*Hey* Chris Did you give it a name yet i like *Homer* ok Bud
125866,DebS,2007-10-23 01:41:00,56,"Wow, what a little beauty! I just love the markings on her face. I'm sure that you'll have many, many adventures together, fishing and otherwise. Great choice! DebS"
125113,Spiel,2007-10-20 08:55:00,9065,"....Well I finally broke down and got my kids a puppy. Yep that's correct and it's also why I'm up so dang early. I'm hoping she'll be a willing fishing partner, seems she already knows what time of day to get up for fishing....lol  I came across this little girl from a fellow at work who got her at 8 weeks old and kept her for 5 weeks before deciding she had to go. Well he said if I wanted to have a look at her she could be mine for free, barring my not taking her she was likely on her way to the S.P.C.A. So I went and had a look last Sunday and was instantly taken in by her puppy charms so home she came. Overall she's a pretty good little girl, a little on the submissive side but I'm working on that. She is also seemingly intelligent and appears to be a quick learner, I hope.  According to the papers he gave me the mother was a Sheltie and the father a Border Collie though I'm uncertain since at 3 1/2 months she's already 20lbs. I guess time will tell. We settled on the name Brook, yes of course I was thinking trout....lol  "
125116,lew,2007-10-20 09:20:00,12767,"Beautiful little pooch ya got there Spiel, congrats bud !!  As for knowing what time to get up for fish'n, Im just walking out the door myself"

125127,aplumma,2007-10-20 12:03:00,6896,Well done Bud everyone should have a puppy around the house few things feel as good as the greeting you get after a bad day.  Art
125128,knotaclue,2007-10-20 12:19:00,136,"Sheâ€™s beautiful ,what a good looking pup ,congratulations on the new family member and fishing pal"
125138,Deano,2007-10-20 13:13:00,767,"Beautiful colors on that pup, you'll find that in no time, she'll be waiting for you to wake up and go fishing. Dogs cherish every waken hour, and material things don't matter, only thing that matters is time spent together."
125140,Gerritt,2007-10-20 13:35:00,6129,Just keep my rod out of the chewing zone!  Sweet pup Chris.  Gerritt.
125218,motv8tr,2007-10-20 20:36:00,2587,"She's adorable  Congrats to you and the kids Chris, you'll have a great time together...just remember to spoil her rotten  Maureen"

125269,Shelley Cooper,2007-10-20 23:02:00,394,Congrat's on the NEW family member Speil.. I'm sure you'll enjoy her.... Nothing like coming home from a crappy day at work and the little feller greets you at the door and cheers you right up....  I couldn't live without MY best friend....
125298,John,2007-10-21 00:46:00,2956,Great looking pup Chris. The first time she greets you at the door makes all of the training and early mornings worthwhile.  J...
125387,Dano,2007-10-21 13:40:00,719," Man, aint that the truth, God I miss that."
125390,Muskieman,2007-10-21 13:59:00,2472,Congrats...  you have just picked a companion for the family... and a fishing buddy that does'nt complain no matter how long you decide to stay out ....if it's too cold or even if there is no bite to be had..  here are my 3 buddies..
125396,danc,2007-10-21 14:19:00,4677,"What a great looking pup Spiel. She'll be your best friend in no time. The Border Collie intelligence in her will amaze you. Just try to remember that you're the master, not her.  You've got 10 days to pick out a Halloween costume for her. Here's some ideas for you.              "
125405,Garyv,2007-10-21 14:44:00,547,As far as I'm concerned you won't regret it.   Help your pooch to get over her submissive problem now to save problems in the future.  I have to admit I'm prejudiced about dogs. Amy goes everywhere with me and loves it in the boat. Shes great with kids and adults.  In the last 2 years I have spent approx $4000 in operations she requires as she has a rare ( only dog ever documented ) disease of the liver lining but she is worth  every penny.
125439,Joey,2007-10-21 18:47:00,9122,What a sweetie!!!  Very nice looking dog Chris.  I bet the kids are thrilled.  Good for you.  Enjoy your new companion.  Joey
125446,kuhaman,2007-10-21 19:57:00,503,Great lookin pup. I have a border collie and sometimes I think that dang dog is smarter than me.
125506,Rattletrap2,2007-10-22 00:52:00,1652,"Congratulations on the new addition to the family Chris! I agree with DanC, The Border Collie in her will amaze you with how smart she is. Our old Bubba is 9 years old and part Shepherd, part Border Collie, and part Black Lab... and maybe a couple of other parts thrown in for good measure!"
125518,ChrisK,2007-10-22 01:17:00,2772,Cute lil pooch you got there Chris....She'll make a fine fishin partner and if you start her training soon you could have her fetchin your newspaper and beer before Christmass....
125596,Spiel,2007-10-22 11:59:00,9065,"....Thanks everyone. While this is indeed the first dog for the kids it's my fourth. I've been wanting a new dog for some time and finally the time seemed right. As for intelligence, well I have to say that I'm impressed. After only one week the submissive problem is well under control, simple commands (sit, stay, come and no) are understood fully and complied with, simply amazing. She's been crate trained and while needing at least one mid-night outing to pee last night she slept through till morning without a whimper. I think I've got a winner."
125600,lew,2007-10-22 12:28:00,12767,"Hey Chris, winter's coming soon, so don't forget the warm clothes for Brook on your upcoming ice fish'n trips together  "
125610,Squid,2007-10-22 13:39:00,1656,What a sweetie Chris! Congrats.
