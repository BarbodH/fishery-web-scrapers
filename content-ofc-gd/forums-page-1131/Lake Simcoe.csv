109738,Matt15,2007-09-02 21:32:00,107,I was thinking of fishing the holland landing for some pike since its so close to home. Has anyone had and luck there recently? Is it worth it to give it try or would I have better chances in cooks bay. Thanks for any advice.   Matt
109890,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-03 14:55:00,0,I would imagine there would only be snot rockets in at this time of year but you never know. Water temps are down. Lot of good large mouth though from what I hear.....
125627,mooseroo,2007-10-22 14:53:00,80, Can you elaborate on the term snot rocket? It's a new one for me!
125629,BFSC Kevin,2007-10-22 15:00:00,1351,"snot rockets = smaller pikes... something like under 25 inches?  just a nick name,"

125634,Terry,2007-10-22 15:19:00,14456,I would be surprised if you caught any pike there this time of year cooks bay would be my choice
125637,BFSC Kevin,2007-10-22 15:28:00,1351," really... all the pike i've caught dt were all fair sized.. but then again, i don't fish there THAT much..  kevin"
125646,Blake,2007-10-22 16:00:00,418,Cooks will be your better choice for bigger fish.

125889,HTHM,2007-10-23 03:02:00,4082,That's not a snot rocket; its a snot expert. Expert = a has-been drip under pressure
