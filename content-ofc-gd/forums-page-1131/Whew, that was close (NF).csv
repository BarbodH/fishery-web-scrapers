125683,cranks bait,2007-10-22 17:48:00,721,I guess this is what happens when you go down the road pulling a catwalk?  Deer was just popping out to say keep the front wheel down buddy.  I usually see it happen with road and mountain bikes.  Nice to see it happen on a motorized vehicle as well.  Scott
