Water was cold and a bit murkier then the last time i was there, and spotting the fish was much harder. Still managed to see couple of them swimming around, and ended up catching most of them. Went 2/4, loosing two in some current and shallow water. here are pics   Fish were really really skiny for this time of the year, not sure if i should be concerned"
125815,dsn,2007-10-22 23:57:00,1018,ahh carp fishing. yeah I kinda agree they do look kinda skinny. I'm used to the fatter fish. Least you got some action in 2.5hrs.  dsn
125885,007,2007-10-23 02:46:00,537,Those look like river carp to me - definitely skinnier than their lake dwelling brothers and sisters.  Nice catch though for a couple of hours at this time of year.  Good job Marko!  007
