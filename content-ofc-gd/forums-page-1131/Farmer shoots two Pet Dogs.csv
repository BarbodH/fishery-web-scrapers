126061,camillj,2007-10-23 18:30:00,1988,"  Well said Joe ... there's a lot more to right and wrong than whats written in the law books or in contracts... and while I certainly have no idea what all the facts are in this case... and frankly no interest in being the 'judge' ... I would think that if we remembered that we dont get to 'log off' or hide behind the rules in real life, we would all think longer and harder before we do harm to our neighbors... especially harm that cant be undone if you find out you were wrong."
126068,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-10-23 18:50:00,39,To shoot two golden retrivers when he could have easily shot overhead or close to them is pathetic.This shoot first think later mentality reminds me of Texas and we all know how well they do down there.I am a firm beliver that it is the owner of the dog that determines alot of it's behaviour.I am not naive to the fact that we are dealing with animals but the reality is anyone can own a dog.Your a pretty weak person if you feel that you have to shoot to helpless goldens to prove your a man.
126071,Roy,2007-10-23 18:54:00,13728,He must have been an Evinrude owner.
126073,Terry,2007-10-23 18:57:00,14456,"but you don't know the facts nor do I but woulda coulda shoulda...crap  who to say he didn't shoot over their heads every day this week, but had a lamb cornered and it was time to end it or maybe the dogs killed one of his animals or maybe he say the law states I can so I did......no one knows   people are coming to conclusions without having even the basic facts.........lets be holier then thou and make up the facts to support our position.....give me a break....."
126078,huntervasili,2007-10-23 19:06:00,1604,"A few things... First off although younger livestock may not always be particularily expensive to buy, Prized animals are worth much more than many may believe. A bull although only worth very little when slaughtered is invaluable to a farmer as he can breed his cows and keep the bull which has a strong line of genes, for those of you who know lots about dogs how much do you think it would cost just to have a prized stud attempt to impregnate your dog. It is the same idea. As well horses can be worht more than most people will ever have in savings depending on its use. Lastly though the way I interpreted the story, the point of killing the dogs was to protect the farmer and his property, not to prove he's a man."
126089,Mark Kulik,2007-10-23 19:24:00,348,"I am not a farmer but my 5 yr. old got bitten by a dog a year ago-got loose-right on our yard, woman said, he's never bitten anyone before, is this supposed to make me feel better? if I had been there I would have punted it for a field goal, I like animals but kids, family members and in this case livestock which is this mans livelyhood is priority! got dogs get a leash or a fence."
126094,addy79,2007-10-23 19:47:00,573,keep driftin jagoff!!
126103,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-10-23 20:06:00,39,Starting to think you want an evinrude Roy Or a boyfriend .Does everyone get special treatment like me ?
126107,blaque,2007-10-23 20:17:00,2419, Absolute quote of the week!
126110,highdrifter,2007-10-23 20:24:00,2534," I second that notion.  We've also had retrievers all our lives.  They may raise a fuss within sight of a large animal, but I don't see them causing any harm.  Without knowing to what extent the dogs were harrassing the livestock, and what kind of livestock it was, no one should make assumptions.  I can't honestly a golden retriever causing any physical harm to a cow or pig.  I'm sure dogs can cause come considerable commotion among cows, especially milking cows and calfs, but I just can't see a golden retriever physically hurting such an animal.  We do need to know the full story.  If the farmer was within his rights, I sure hope he used good judgement before shooting such an animal at close range.  Otherwise, I'd wheel him into the nut house..  The owners were careless no doubt.  If the owners knew there were livestock in the area, the should have been placed on a leash.  Seems a shame that all this could have been prevented had the owners kept their dogs within eye sight, or tied to a leash.  To me, this is news, because I can't even fathom someone shooting an animal at close rance with an otherwise peacefull nature.  Pretty freaky s**t if you ask me.  Who the heck is this guy anyway??  Can we get a picture of this farmer John??  cheers HD"
126113,lew,2007-10-23 20:29:00,12767,Was it ever made public if this farmer even raised livestock ??  Perhaps he's a corn grower and just hates dogs
126114,LeXXington,2007-10-23 20:31:00,1928,"Farmer may have been a bit jumpy to shoot, but no animal lover would jump too the chance to help pay for the farmers live stock if it got hurt, Sick or contaminated.  If it was one dog you can deal with it, 2 dogs feed of the freezy of another.  Life goes on,"
126118,highdrifter,2007-10-23 20:47:00,2534, Whoah!  Strong words there mate.  Your name's real original too.  I high stick a nymph through a pool... I guess you point your rod tip down and just strip am I right??  yeeeesshhh
126120,highdrifter,2007-10-23 20:49:00,2534, What was that Paul??
126121,Cory,2007-10-23 20:51:00,170,"Dogs are pack animals.  And when they get in the pack mode the may not act the same way you expect them to act at home.  Any dog can be aggressive even more so when in a pack situation.  Yup Rizzo even your cute cuddly Poodle is(was) a hunting breed dog even though they are no longer considered in the sporting group.  I doubt anybody would be raising this much fuss if it were a “pit bull”.  BSL is Bull.  A farmer somewhat near me uses Great Pyrenees to protect his flock, I’m sure Rick can give a good background on this breed.  I’d hate to see what would have happened to the two goldens if they had gone after this farmers flock.  While normally gentle and layed back the LGD’s can and will fight to the death if necessary.  Normally the predator will back down when confronted by the size of the big dog(s)."
126122,misfish,2007-10-23 20:53:00,29133,I have no comment but read  THIS
126127,Terry,2007-10-23 21:03:00,14456,"but the dogs are that way, down there because their toilets flush the other direction"
126140,highdrifter,2007-10-23 21:49:00,2534,  BLIMEE!  A dingo ate my baby!! LOL
126146,ch312,2007-10-23 22:10:00,1590,"totally legal for a farmer to protect his livestock from any dog even if it has a pink tutu on and i agree with this 100%. when you mess with a mans way of supporting his family you should be prepared to suffer the consequences. if the dog owners would have kept the dogs on their property and none of this would have happened.  100% the dog owners fault, not the dogs."
126208,oxcowboy,2007-10-24 01:59:00,544,"ok folks,   first of all i am a dog owner, i own several dogs as a matter of fact, Boston terriers and blue heelers. i am  also a cattle, hog, and now goat farmer.  i love my dogs, but i also have seen what they can become when in groups (packs).  they are not the same animal when they are with others, they are often more aggressive and more likely to get in trouble.  we have had several area farmers flocks of sheep nearly wiped out by stray dogs.  one guy lost around 30 head in 1 night.  once a dog gets a kill, they will usually continue this type of behavior.  i have read all the post on this and can see where people without an agricultural background may see this as some crazy blood thirsty farmer murdering two defenseless pets, and it might be, BUT it also might be some guy thats not going to have much of a christmas for his kids this year because his source of hard earned income has be destroyed.  Farming isnt an easy life, there isnt much glory and the pay isnt near what it should be.   by the way, these prices are per 100 lbs of body weight, and for common animals.  i worked a purebred cattle sale about a month ago, the top lot brought $27,000 and seven day old frozen embryo's were bringing anywhere from 300 to 700 per egg.    livestock can be very expensive, there is a lot of cost in producing that steak that you eat!  the farmer has a small proffit if any in the product that they sell.  even at stockyard prices a beef cow may weigh 1200 lbs and @51.oo that is still over 600 dollars that the animal is worth.  How many of you have that much money that you let your dog chew on a stack of 100 $ bills?  just my thoughts on the matter.  jason"
126210,Fisherman,2007-10-24 02:20:00,7201,"Amen, well said Oxcowboy.  Maybe this thread should be locked up, it's beginning to appear people pay less attention to the loss of human life that happens all over compared to the media sensationalism over a couple of free running dogs, whatever the breed."
126232,bigfish1965,2007-10-24 03:54:00,3382,"Agreed fisherman. The two dogs were shot as a result of bad judgment on the part of humans. Most golden retriever owners are far more careful of their pets, but accidents happen. Keep a close eye on yours."
125983,Hellfish,2007-10-23 14:58:00,308,"well i guess the next time my neighbours dog comes in my backyard im going to poison it, cause it ate my vegetables out of my garden, cost me money for the seeds and fertilizer,also go look at the price of livestock, yall are making it sound like they are worth alot of money, slaughter cows go for -20.00-51.00, milk cows go for 50.00-125.00, lambs 41-109.00, the prices are right on the net and btw those prices are american as well latest in PA, like it was said b4 call spca get them removed, shoot warning shots whatever dont just kill the 2 dogs. BTW go out to the country and see how many farm dogs u see w/o having leashes on go check the hurding dogs they have no leashes on. This just blows me away, heres a link with some cattle pricing http://www.cattle.com/Markets/barn_report.aspx?code=LN_LS157 . Newayz it was said b4 sue the stinking people for all damage from the dogs, get your money back, but to shoot 2 retrievers cause they are going after their precious wabbits is just crazi."
125998,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-23 16:00:00,835,"He could have saved a lot of aggravation if he had practiced shoot , shovel and shut up.  Takes about 3 hrs for the neighbors to catch their goldie he's dumb as a rock, the dog that is.  Why does the media demonise farmers without the facts, just couldn't resist putting crying kids on tv. Next we'll hear from Bill O'Rielly and he'll set us right."
126020,keram,2007-10-23 16:58:00,585," Well, you are right, but not 100% in my opinion  I follow this thread from beginning and it really blows my mind reading all the posts, regardless of the position (to the described events) of the poster. The LAW is on the farmer’s side and he and his supporters gladly hide behind it. Well, the LAW says that max speed on the highway is 100km/hr, how many of you stick to the first one and do not give a damn about the other. It is THE LAW too. What about “who owns the water” problem – THE LAW stands behind me and I do not care what anybody has to say about this?. What about little bit of common sense, or little bit of respect for other human being and his property. No, no way this cannot be used in court. I still cannot figure out that we call ourselves “homo sapiens”. Homo?,  maybe, but for “sapiens” we have a long way to go."
125816,jedimaster,2007-10-22 23:59:00,3472,"I dunno, I agree with th above guy, media is always trying to sway a story that makes it sell the most advertisements. But the story itself is interesting. Sad for the family and slightly supportive of the farmer. Even as a dog owner I think I tend to side a bit with the farmer. But really the thing is if the dogs were in range of a shotgun. Then he should have been able to at least determine the danger these pets were going to or have caused. I am just hoping he used some sort of judgment and wasn't just target shooting.  Also don't forget that a Golden retriver is a bread hunting dog.  Maybe not to many suburbanites but Hunters see Goldens as long haired retrievers. Hunting dogs. If it were say a Black Lab, or a some other dog the story may not even get in the news. I would think with the goldens running loose in a feild full of sheep would and could cause some real havoc for the farm animals."
125830,solopaddler,2007-10-23 00:23:00,8605," Okay fine, if that's what you believe then why title your post ""Farmer shoots two Pet Dogs""? Why not simply ""Farmer shoots two dogs""? Or were you perhaps trying to sensationalize the issue not unlike the media  ."
125831,KyleM,2007-10-23 00:27:00,218,"Even if it was the dogs first time on the property, Id shoot it if it were near the stock. Not sure how many of you guys have grown up around farms but.......do some research and look at cattle prices.  If a dogs been on the loose for a few days then theres no telling what diseases and junk its been into.  You dont want stock getting sick as it spreads like wildfire."
125833,solopaddler,2007-10-23 00:31:00,8605," Can't argue with that statement, you've got a point."
125835,Daplumma,2007-10-23 00:34:00,1961,I had one of my neighbors pit bull get into my pasture and run my sheep one day.I had every right in the state of Virginia to kill his dog on the spot.I chased him back thru the fence and went to work on the  fence where the dog got thru.The owner came out and helped me and he thanked me for not shooting his dog.This farmer probably knew the dogs and the owners.He should also know that you have to live with your neighbors and just cause you can do something doesn't mean you should.The Pit Bull never harassed my sheep again and I still get along with my neighbor.

125843,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-23 00:52:00,835,"I wish Paris Hilton would move to Canada so we could have some real news.  They had some film of a little boy crying over his dead dog I'm surprised they didn't stick a mike in his face and ask him how he feels about it, the media can be such asses sometimes."
125844,Fisherman,2007-10-23 00:53:00,7201,"What I had understood from the news, the dogs had been let off leash to run uncontrolled.  Want to let them run loose, do it on your own property.  The cost of livestock is can be quite high, and if something had gone the other way, then what, oh I'm sorry my dog didn't mean to chase/injure your livestock.  Sorry doesn't recover the cost.  Most all country folk know the rules about free running dogs, some just don't care."
