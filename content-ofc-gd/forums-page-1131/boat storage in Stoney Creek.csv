125652,huey graphite,2007-10-22 16:24:00,362,Can anyone recommend a storage facility for a boat/trailer in this area. Haven't decided yet whether to go with a heated facility or otherwise.  Thanks in advance.

My boat spends the winter months in this barn and  the total price for the ENTIRE winter is only $150  As long as the boat is properly winterized, there's no need for the extra expense of a heated storage facility either.
