53423,Frankypro,2007-03-30 15:48:00,63,Does anyone know if the Queenston ramp is open and if fishing the river would be a go this weekend?  Satalite pics show a lot of ice on the east side of L. Erie and I was wondering if it's worth putting the boat in for the first trip of the year?
53444,huey graphite,2007-03-30 16:47:00,362,I had a good view of that ice on our return flight from Tampa into Buffalo yesterday afternoon. Amazing how large those sheets of ice looked even from up there. I believe they are able to control the amount of ice that travels down river via the ice booms. Not sure if Queenston is navigable.

I was pretty brave at work today at luch but am turning Chicken at the last hour.  Spring run off and the ice above the falls is making me leary about heading out.  Anyone else going out this weekend?  PM me if you don't want to post, but would ever consider watching out for a newby.  Thanks again for your responses!"
