52866,mepps,2007-03-28 22:33:00,1301,"lol, how did they start drilling???"
52903,fishindevil,2007-03-29 00:18:00,6254,WOW..  ..i dont think that you would have a problem taking your 4x4 out on that lake/river....  .
52910,bucktail,2007-03-29 00:23:00,1857,Apparently they start by standing on the roof of the truck and work there way down..... NO THANKS!!!!!!
52911,PatrickGG,2007-03-29 00:24:00,562,"That what I'm talking about, maybe a couple of step ladders would do the trick."
52914,Gerritt,2007-03-29 00:28:00,6129,"I think they drill, add an extension, drill some more, add an extension... similar to drilling for oil... but man.. even for a gas auger I assume it would take a bit of time.  Gerritt."
52923,steverowbotham,2007-03-29 00:48:00,1800,i'm gonna say they likely dont fish 2 lines a piece
52947,trapshooter,2007-03-29 01:26:00,1234,"I wanna know how many fish you'd lose trying to get their heads into the hole.  Funny video though, thanks for posting."
52988,camillj,2007-03-29 03:25:00,1988,Wow . now that takes all the fun out of run and gun
53229,Spiel,2007-03-29 20:55:00,9065,"....Brutal, so how long a gaff would one require?"
