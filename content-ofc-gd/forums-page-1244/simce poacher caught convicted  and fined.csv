53108,Terry,2007-03-29 16:25:00,14456,commission based C.O.s...NO frigg'n way..........  it's sad but not all people including cops and COs are honest people... and in almost every case it's their word against yours....... .some of them boys would be make 7 digit incomes
53144,kennyman,2007-03-29 17:29:00,737,"For a first time offender the fine and suspension were probably correct. Being a repeat offender  I would have like to seen at least a years suspension, $5000 fine and his fishing gear seized. Also since he was hiding and transporting the fish, his vehicle should have been seized as well. As far as the passengers of the vehicle, I really don't think they should be charged with any offence unless they directly admit to something. Not that they aren't somewhat reponsible for what happened, but the charges are VERY unlikely to stick,so why waste the courts time? I guess there could be an immediate license suspension for them. Then let them try to get it back during a hearing? Also,put all of their pictures in the paper then their neighbors, friends and family can be soooo proud of them."
53163,tonyb,2007-03-29 18:50:00,1637,"That's the whole point though Terry - you are worried about the mere thought of it and you abide by the regulations.  Now imagine if you were a poacher considering a fishing trip out of season - no way in you're sane mind would you attempt it  MNR Outlaws all the way  I'd have no problem seeing an MNR officer roll up in an Cadillac Escalade, about time they made some real money  Tony"
53169,BITEME,2007-03-29 18:55:00,1969,I gotta tell you this guy knows he is doing wrong he has repeated this offence in the past and will most likley again his license should be revoked forever his gear his vehicle and anything associated that day should be seized and a very very heavy fine for being an idiot  its the same for impaired driver you cause death injury or damage lifelong ban no 2nd chance just my opinion
53049,ryanheritage,2007-03-29 13:11:00,180,"I figure if he got caught this time how many times has he got away with it.???????! I do believe that if you get busted poaching or something similar they should be hit with a huge fine. I just feel if he was made an example of and it hit the media alot more people would think twice before they kept a fish out of season. I would have seized his license and all things he used to do his crime, fined him 10,000 for each fish out of season and made him clean 10k of shoreline. But thats just me. Even though it wasn't worth the 1000 bucks those two fish Im sure if he had to face my sentence he wouldn't have even considered keeping those fish."
53059,wuchikubo,2007-03-29 13:30:00,1114,"I say the OMNR should invest in tracking devices, similar to those for ALZ patients and animals to that they can check in on them every time they are near fishing waters! Double the fine for each infraction repeated (and hope the money goes back into the OMNR for funding the CO's).  I apologize if I sound a bit harsh, but I don't like to see the OMNR in the condition it is in now!  "
53063,Puckhead,2007-03-29 13:50:00,377,"He knew he was poaching and did it again.  Check that, he was caught again.  Who knows how many times he's walked away with OOS fish. Vehicles, boat, gear, anything used to assist in the crime should be treated the same as any other crime.  If you use your car to rob a bank, they sieze the car.  Why is this any different?  If messages are not sent that poaching is a serious crime/issue, jerk offs will keep taking the risk...  $1000 is hardly headline material."
53070,Steelcat,2007-03-29 14:19:00,191,"Taking off season fish is bad enough, and he actually tried to hide them means he knew about it.  I thought it's the MNR officers' job to fine the poacher and sieze his fishing gears at least.  At least that's what the officer did early spring last year when a couple of guys fished without a license from shore.  The officer walked to the fishing spot, checked everyone's license (including myself).  He actually took all their gears away into his truck.  I guess when someone didn't pay for the license, they will sieze their gears.  As for the poacher, I guess since the guy didn't owe MNR any $$ so the officer let him go with a fine only, then the guy can poach again and get caught again (probably that's how they get their funding)....."
53097,tonyb,2007-03-29 15:46:00,1637,"I still think that the MNR should consider commission based C.O.'s.  Since it is evident the MNR has no money...make the salary $10,000 a year.  But then, the C.O.'s are given a percentage of every fine, say 50% in addition to all the gear they could seize and keep themselves or sell if it was involved in a bust.  Do you think we would have more fines laid (not to mention maximum fines dished out), in addition to more officers afield?  I think so...and poachers would realize it isn't worth losing their truck that towed the S.S. Poacher (also seized) or losing their house that contained the freezer full of Musky fillets and Aurora trout caviar.  Ebay would have to create a portal for all these officers to be able to get rid of all the gear, and we would get some sweet deals!  mnr.lol.ebay.com  Seriously! Tony"
53105,bbog,2007-03-29 16:13:00,665,Hey tonyb I like your idea of commission based enforcement (if we had a way to control the overly zealous).  No amount of fine is too much for a repeat offender!
