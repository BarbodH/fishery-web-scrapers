Not knowing which one to get, she went to the counter and said to a sales clerk wearing very dark shades.  ""Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me  anything  about this rod and reel?""  He said, ""Ma'am, I'm completely blind; but if you'll drop it on the counter, I can tell you everything you need to know from the sound  it makes.""   Unbelieving,  she dropped it on the counter anyway.  He said, ""That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with a Zebco 404 reel  and 10-LB test line. It's a good  all-around combination; and it's on sale this week for only $20.00.""  She:   ""It's amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of  it dropping on the counter. I'll take it!"" As she opened her purse, her credit card dropped on the floor.  ""Oh,  that sounds like a Master Card,"" he  said.  She  bent down to pick it up and  accidentally  broke  wind.  She was really embarrassed, but then realized there is no way the blind clerk could tell who  did it.  The  man rang up the sale and said, ""That'll be $34.50 please.""   The  woman was totally confused by this and asked,  ""Didn't you tell me it was  on sale for $20.00? How did you get  $34.50?""   He  replied, ""Yes, Ma'am. The rod and reel  is  $20.00, the Duck Call is $11.00 and  the  Catfish Bait is $3.50."" "
