As he had some time to kill, he decided to take a tour through a local mall, to see what's what. He found himself in the biggest grocery store he had ever seen! Walking the aisles in sheer amazement at the quantity and quality of the goods offered, he then stopped in front of the meat section, staring in awe at all the meat available. He noticed what seemed to be the most popular item being sold were these tube like things the people were calling ""sauce-ages"". As they seemd to be all the rage, he decided to buy a pack and take them home, to his wife as a surprise. Upon arriving home, he hands his wife the ""sause -ages"" and tells her ""honey, I'm goin fishin, I'd like you to have those there sauce-ages cooked up for me supper"" and off he goes. In the evening, he arrives home  and sits down at the dinner table and calls to his wife ""honey, I'm ready for my ""sauce-ages""! His wife brings in the plate from the kitchen and sets it down in front of him. He looks at the plate and only see's a puddle of grease and a small pile of skin. ""Honey, what happened to my ""sauce-ages"", asked the Newfie? ""Well, once you cut the head and tail off, then gut them, there's not alot left to cook!"" said his wife! HH PS... sorry Misfish!"
