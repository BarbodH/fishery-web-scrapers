52469,wgk36,2007-03-27 23:15:00,69,"Hi all,  I just joined last week.  I live in St-Hubert, QC (near Montreal) and do most of my fishing with MikeThePike.  He invited me on a fishing trip with the guys a couple of years ago, and I fell for the sport, hook, line and sinker.  I have a Princecraft Ungava with a 9.9 Honda that I pull behind my hybrid camper.  I do most of my fishing along the St-Lawrence River in Ontario and Quebec.  I fish mostly Walleye, Pike, Bass and Perch.  I look forward to reading your posts and chating with you in the future.  GlennK"
