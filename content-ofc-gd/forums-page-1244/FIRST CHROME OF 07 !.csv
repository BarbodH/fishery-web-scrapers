After checking a few tribs and finding only 2-4 inches of visibility, we finally settled on a trib and started drifting.  I went 1 for 2 landing a nice chromer, maybe 4 pounds or so.  My buddy James went 1 for 4 with another nice steelie.  I got mine on brown roe in a chartreuse bag, he got his on a little berkley power worm.  Packed it up at around noon and headed home.  Pics are now on here    "
52363,ccmtcanada,2007-03-27 18:17:00,7971,"Way to go Steve!  The conditions didn't sound optimal at all, but you still managed to catch some.  I'll be trying my luck at some night time steelies on the tribs maybe tomorrow night...after they clear up a bit more.  Awaiting your pics...."
