I remember being able to catch over 100 of those things in an hour.  Can anyone comment on the current perch fishery in the river and also give some insight on the regulations these days (none existed back then) on the season and parts of the river if fishing from a boat.  Since the shore walleye bite was always at night i never got to experience it, but would love to try if i head down there for a weekend in the coming weeks.  Again, season and parts of the river locations would be great.  Much appreciated."

The walleye bite is just starting and the perch bite can be good in the spring too. Not many fish perch on the river when we have such a great walleye fishery. [emailÂ protected]"
