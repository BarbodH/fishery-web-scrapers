When the three astonished men had settled down enough to speak, the first guy asked humbly, ""Jesus, I've suffered from back pain ever since I took shrapnel in the Vietnam War. Could you help me?"" ""Of course, my son,"" Jesus said. And, when he touched the man's back he felt relief for the first time in years.  The second guy who wore very thick glasses and had a hard time reading and driving , asked if Jesus could do anything about his poor eyesight. Jesus smiled, removed the man's glasses and tossed them into the lake. When they hit the water, the man's eyes cleared and he could see everything distinctly.  When Jesus turned to the third guy, the guy put his hands out defensively. ""Don't touch me!"" he cried. ""I'm on a disability pension."""
