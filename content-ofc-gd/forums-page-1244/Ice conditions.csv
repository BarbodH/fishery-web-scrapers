52782,Headhunter,2007-03-28 18:30:00,5703,"I just checked the forecast for the weekend and it looks like -10c on Saturday night in Barrie. I would really like to get out Perchin again, just wondering if anyone knows what Cook's looks like now and if you think -10C will help to solidify the Bay for a Sunday fish? Thanks all, HH"
52791,tonyb,2007-03-28 19:11:00,1637,"From Lake Simcoe Message Board: Posted Today. ""WEll i was out on it yesterday... But not venturing today.. yesterday was jumping Gaps out there and Not worth it anymore... I had a FLoat jacket and ice picks but really ... Why bother for the few more perch.. Take your kids out spend some time with the wife instead.. open water will be here before u know it! ""  Hope that helps you decide.  Tony"
52794,Headhunter,2007-03-28 19:13:00,5703,"Thanks Tony... not what I wanted to hear, but better to know than find out the hard way! HH"
52804,fishnsled,2007-03-28 19:45:00,3520,Here's today's satellite image. A picture is worth a thousand words.  
52806,misfish,2007-03-28 19:49:00,29133,Are they really worth it ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
52808,tonyb,2007-03-28 19:57:00,1637,Ohh yeah that picture makes it look kind of sketchy.  Couchiching looks like it is still frozen over good.  Tony
52811,Headhunter,2007-03-28 20:04:00,5703,"Thanks for the map FishnSled...doesn't look good at all! I shoulda got out with you last weekend! Tony, Couch is an option... for now. Misfish... they really aren't worth it, until they hit the oil/lard and then my other brain, read stomach here, takes over! ""Look at me, I'm a pear""! HH"
52817,Terry,2007-03-28 20:11:00,14456,it really is going to hell in a hand basket   
52820,misfish,2007-03-28 20:17:00,29133,"Looking at the picture,I am ready to rip the shrink wrap off the ol boat and Im ready for blast off."
52824,Cast-Away,2007-03-28 20:29:00,790,"I hate to say it Headhunter, but are you out of your !@$#$($ mind to go out on the ice at this time of year? That is like taking a snowmobile out on Simcoe in December. Do you not have a family or loved ones to think about leaving behind? Please wait for the soft water. Don't become someone that I read about in the Newmarket newspaper in the coming weeks."
52825,fishnsled,2007-03-28 20:34:00,3520, You're reading my mind Misfish.  But then you look at the long range forecast and wonder.......should I wait????  Weather forecast.
52827,Terry,2007-03-28 20:35:00,14456,but beaverton looks pretty good for perch and I heard they are doing well for them    we could drag out my folding boat if the ice gets too thin
52830,fishnsled,2007-03-28 20:41:00,3520,Are ya thinking of a mini G2G Terry?  How many will fit in that boat of yours?    Off the Park looks good too.
52835,LeXXington,2007-03-28 20:52:00,1928,"LOL, guy tell us if your taking and good equipment with you so we can pick it up later from our boats  The SAT pics are normally 24 hours out,  3 sunny warm days later.. for perch?  I know cabin fever is  strong but you can pull through 2 weeks until the perch fest"
52840,misfish,2007-03-28 21:26:00,29133,Man of reason. I got dibs on the clam.LOL
52933,fishindevil,2007-03-29 01:07:00,6254,"well it sure doesnt look good,does it?????....it will be open water real soon by the looks of things....cheers   BRING ON THE OPEN WATER"
52973,love2fishhave2work,2007-03-29 02:23:00,212,"Do me favor, if you go, please wear some very protective clothing with a life jacket and some bright colors so that it is easier to spot you when I come looking for you on Monday in my new boat   ."
52974,crappiesteve,2007-03-29 02:37:00,220,"..was up at gilford Sunday,still 16inches of ice.That was the last day for me,time to stay off.  Steve"
53018,misfish,2007-03-29 10:01:00,29133,"I believe I seen a report from Skud stating the ice was becoming honey combed., Thats enough to make me stay off."
53084,daisy_girl58,2007-03-29 15:16:00,116,Lorissa sez....  Better not to be on nightly news than to be another March victim....
53101,Headhunter,2007-03-29 16:01:00,5703,"Thanks for all of your replies! To those who provided specific information, I thank you! To those who commented on my sanity, appreciate the concern, but I'm not stupid, just curious! I'd like to get out this weekend and that's why I asked the question. I won't go if the conditions are bad, you won't see me on the news (unless I win the Lottery?LOL). I was just hoping to get some up to date conditions info, to save me the drive up, just to turn around! Thanks again all! FNS... I hear the boat calling you!!!! HH"
