Every chance I get, I'm scouting tribs, reading articles, buying equipment and fishing..... The past week has been great: catching fish off piers and hooking into a few on the streams. Fishing has now become a 12 month event..... Enjoy the pics and enjoy your time outdoors! Until next time, Cheese  "
