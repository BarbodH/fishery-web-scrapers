52715,bassinator,2007-03-28 14:45:00,32,"Quick question...I was thinking of buying an auto/manual PFD from Cabela's and was wondering because it was rated Coast Guard Approved in the US if it would be ""approved"" as a flotation device here in Canada. Any info would be great!!"
52717,taper,2007-03-28 14:48:00,611,"It must say Canada Coast Guard approved to be legal in Canada. From the little I know about the auto type PFD's I believe they are not considered legal unless you wear them at all times, they cannot just sit beside you."
52719,caper,2007-03-28 14:58:00,210,or Transport Canada approved. That's not to say you couldn't use it if you had other approved PFD's on board of the right size though. Although if your going to buy one may as well be approved for Canada
52720,Terry,2007-03-28 15:03:00,14456,"if you buy an auto PFD you must wear it all the time while you are in the boat or it is not considered a PFD or have an extra regular one in the boat and again, if no T P Canada approved, it doesn't count as a PFD"
52742,grt1,2007-03-28 15:54:00,638,"I ordered one of these 2 weeks ago. BUT, they cannot ship them into Canada, so I had to  have mine shiipped to a friend that has the camp next door to bring with him when he comes in the spring. I hope you have someone that can do the same for you.."
52771,Guest lundboy,2007-03-28 17:38:00,0,"Why not just get the Mustang... Made in Canada, CCG Approved  http://www.mustangsurvival.com/products/product.php?id=453  or  http://www.mustangsurvival.com/products/product.php?id=508  The second one is more expensive because it is designed NOT to inflate because of rain (needs full immersion)  Available at Le baron's, Shop Canadian!"
52776,BITEME,2007-03-28 17:51:00,1969,Here is the way I see this anything manual has the potential to break I will not put my trust into a bladder alone off chance you flip out of your boat unconcious and it doesnt auto inflate ..........YOU DIE!!  just a thought
52784,douG,2007-03-28 18:32:00,2693,The don't like to ship the auto inflate models into Canada because they have a compressed CO2 cylinder inside.
52855,Rich Clemens,2007-03-28 22:10:00,3131,"I'll be looking to replace PFD's this year as well and I've been eyeballing the Mustangs as well in the catalogs.  I have a BPS a couple hours from where I live, so I'll be checking them out very soon.  I'll keep thje old style in the boat .... just in case."
52864,Terry,2007-03-28 22:31:00,14456,well I like them...I've had a mustang airforce for 5 or 6 years now..prices sure have come down on them
52868,Big Cliff,2007-03-28 22:41:00,6899,I also have an inflatable (not auto) but I love it. One of the best investments I think I have made. Bought mine at CTC for under $100.00.
52959,sirfish,2007-03-29 01:43:00,175,"West coast marine in Buffalo sells mustangs that have the ccg  approval,at great prices, they also have a store in Barrie somewhere. They cannot be shipped via border for potential gas cylinder threat"
