52995,verno,2007-03-29 03:53:00,178,That was a cool video.  If they had been carrying a gaff though...
53003,tjsa,2007-03-29 04:37:00,1578,"At least with the Orcas, its a quick bite of the fish,  whole or half, you will never have the chance to land one, nor would you want to. Have seen video of the seals taking hold of fish being fought, and also getting hooked in the process, not a pretty sight, and not fun."
