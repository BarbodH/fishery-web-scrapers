53160,tonyb,2007-03-29 18:42:00,1637," Cisco, maybe you are right, maybe I should put someone else to task who's job it is to find homes for people.  I am just not sure if agents would really go to that distance, I would seriously not want me as a client if I was a realtor.  The logic in us selling privately was to pass along the savings and enjoyable experience that we got when we purchased our home privately (Bank appraisal was thousands more than we paid - I have heard bank appraisals are generally less than selling prices?)  Tony"
53187,pigeonfisher,2007-03-29 19:32:00,696,Your buying agent will be making 3% on the value of the home you purchase.  It is his/her job to find you the home you want.
53336,T Fisher,2007-03-30 03:31:00,139,"Hey Tony I have a 3 car garage tandum 1 side 40 ft long the other side is 20, I can back my 17ft Lund and Silverado truck in and lock the door.  Lot's for sale in Markham."
53157,tonyb,2007-03-29 18:32:00,1637,"You lucky dogs living out in the country with your big lots, mature trees, and cheaper housing.  I am truly envious!  As for me, in the GTA, I am limited to the cheap, thrown together houses, or 20-30yr old homes in relatively original state.  The older houses you speak of with big lots, are $400,000.00 and up in price, just out of reach.  Custom homes would be anywhere from $500,000.00-$1,000,000.00 when you factor in purchasing a lot with a home on it, and tearing it down in order to build the new one.  There just isn't free space that hasn't been purchased for high density housing purposes or retail outlets in the area.  Tony"
52367,tonyb,2007-03-27 18:36:00,1637,"Thanks for the feedback guys.  As I initially mentioned, I know that by adding a swing tongue and angling the boat in the garage can get a 19' boat squeezed into a 20' garage, but it's not exactly a smooth operation, and you must be exact on placement when you back the boat in.  (Aaron does this now and I have helped him on numerous occasions, I don't know how the heck he does it on his own, a 19' boat isn't exactly light to push around and manuever by hand)  I thought the most difficult part of getting a boat would be convinving my wife that I need something that expensive   Turns out now I have the green light, but can't find a place to accomodate it.  I have even looked at self-storage options, but for a heated storage unit large enough to house the boat around here you're talking $400 a month!  That goes a lot further when you can add it to your mortgage.  Tony  EDIT: Weedman, I thought about staying in my townhouse and getting a smaller boat that would fit in the garage, but it would significantly reduce the amount of opportunities I would be able to use the boat since I would be fishing primarily on the big water (Lake O., Erie, Niagara River, Bay of Quinte)  I even thought about just fishing small inland lakes, but then I realized I wouldn't really be happy with that arrangement."
52388,fishdawg,2007-03-27 19:36:00,912,hmmm  how much thought have you given into buying a house with adequate land to put up your own garage?
52389,Hooked,2007-03-27 19:48:00,891, Thats exactly what I was thinking fishdawg!
52393,LeXXington,2007-03-27 19:56:00,1928,"Like all its a big issue for us Suburb people. I only have a single garage so no twisting in the wind for me..  Remember just cause the boat says 19"" there is neck and engine so it all adds to the length.  I fit my 15.1 Legend with a 25hp with 4"" to spare into a 19' single.  Love a bigger boat but no way am I paying for storage!! CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP"
52395,Uncle Buck,2007-03-27 20:00:00,1000,19' boat is a little big for the grand prix no?
52399,aniceguy,2007-03-27 20:14:00,1094,"tony you can park it in my garage it will accomadate it to perfection, of course along with the free stroage there is a casual user agreeement lol"
52401,SlowPoke,2007-03-27 20:17:00,2984,"I know your dilemma... 18' garage. My initial solution was to open up the back wall of the garage to accomodate the motor in the kitchen. My wife was pretty unreasonable about that. I eventually found offsite indoor storage... year round at $10/foot. Great deal but it was 45 minutes away. I eventually sold the boat. Fast forward a few years to now and I have a larger boat and we're discussing widening the driveway or putting it in the side yard or backyard... all of which will be reletively expensive. I am fortunate that my local bylaw permits boat storage up to (m) 2.4 width, 2.4 height and 6 length. I am also permitted to widen my driveway to 50% or 6 meters whichever is less within road allowance. This of course means the boat will still be outside. I can get outside controlled access storage for $30/month... hmmmm.... but enough about me.  Do you have to have your boat indoors?  -Brian"
52403,tonyb,2007-03-27 20:32:00,1637,"Yes space is an issue in Burlington area, otherwise I could build a garage on a lot next to the house.    I wish that my wife and I could work away from the city but our fields of expertise are in I.T. and close to the GTA is where the jobs are at...  Uncle Buck, the plan is Move -- Buy Boat -- Trade Grand prix for Pick-up truck.  aniceguy...fitting name, I won't be able to sleep at night unless my baby is secure in my own garage  Tony"
52404,tonyb,2007-03-27 20:39:00,1637,"I would prefer to have my boat indoors.   I'd hate to leave it exposed to the elements in winter - Not to mention it will need to melt after a day on the Niagara River in December  Plus, if I left it outside I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving all my gear in it, removing sonar, gps, trolling motor, etc. another hassle.  It really is going to be a needle in the haystack if I do find something that can accomodate our needs.  Tony"
52412,Gerry,2007-03-27 21:05:00,257,"I had a similar issue a few years ago and I decided to ask a builder to modify an existing house plan to give me the demensions that I required. I have a 21' bassboat without a swing tongue so I asked for 30' inside length. He was able to give 28'3"". I also asked to have the garage widened and he gave me an extra foot. I then asked for a larger door, single door (for a 2 car garage) but 9' high. I got it and I'm in heaven. The wife says we built a house around a garage ..... works for me.   We had to give up some interior space but that was OK. The builder was very good about it but he had an in-house architect which helped with the mods.  So, perhaps you need to speak to builders again. If you're serious about it and willing to absorb some additonal cost he should be willing to accomodate you. Good luck."
52437,Daplumma,2007-03-27 22:03:00,1961,"This is the garage we ended up building if you can.It holds my 1975 trcuk,my 17' boat and my 1965 truck.I also has room for my tools,a work bench and a fridge full of beverages.It uses mostly nominal dimensions,has no posts in the middle but does require some engineered trusses for the roof.I only wish I had gone bigger. https://www.behmdesign.com/garageplans/1080-1.html Here is a pic.
