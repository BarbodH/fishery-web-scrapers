53319,chilli,2007-03-30 02:02:00,199,"Be very carefull!  I bought the ""cool white"" bulbs because they seem more like natural light and a 9w of the cool white lights up the same space a 23 w of soft white will.  On the package it said not to dispose of in the garbage as it contained mercury and should be disposed of at a faciltity equipped to deal with mercury""  NICE. So much for ""greener"" bulbs."

53331,OhioFisherman,2007-03-30 03:12:00,6623,"I moved some 150 watt equiv bulbs from the garage to the barn today, they had been in the garage for about a year, and during the spring and warmer months we don`t close the garage door until everyone is in for the night.  Darn things sounded like a salt shaker, vents in the plastic base were to big to keep out a lot of bugs, I don`t know what effect it has on the bulbs retaining heat(shortening life), or a possibility of a fire hazard. I blew them out with the air compressor."
53333,John Bacon,2007-03-30 03:18:00,3277," I read an article on the internet about this recently.  The CFL do contain small amounts of mercury.  But coal contains mercury which is released into the atmosphere when it is burned.  According to the article, the CFL's actually reduce the amount of mercury introduced into the environment by reducing the amount of coal required to generate electricity."
50520,Guest lundboy,2007-03-22 16:29:00,0,"Here's an excerpt and link to an article from UK Daily Mail that explains some of the problems with CFL bulbs:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/arti...in_page_id=1770  ""So what are the disadvantages of CFLs over the traditional bulbs we will no longer be allowed to buy? Quite apart from the fact that the CFLs are larger, much heavier and mostly much uglier than familiar bulbs - and up to 20 times more expensive - the vast majority of them give off a harsher, less pleasant light.  Because they do not produce light in a steady stream, like an incandescent bulb, but flicker 50 times a second (60 in Canada), some who use them for reading eventually find their eyes beginning to swim - and they can make fast-moving machine parts look stationary, posing a serious safety problem.  Fluorescent CFLs cannot be used with dimmer switches or electronically-triggered security lights, so these will become a thing of the past. They cannot be used in microwaves, ovens or freezers, because these are either too hot or too cold for them to function (at any temperature above 60C degrees or lower than -20C they don't work),  More seriously, because CFLs need much more ventilation than a standard bulb, they cannot be used in any enclosed light fitting which is not open at both bottom and top - the implications of which for homeowners are horrendous.  Astonishingly, according to a report on 'energy scenarios in the domestic lighting sector', carried out last year for Defra by its Market Transformation Programme, 'less than 50 per cent of the fittings installed in UK homes can currently take CFLs'. In other words, on the Government's own figures, the owners of Britain's 24 million homes will have to replace hundreds of millions of light fittings, at a cost upwards of Â£3billion.  In addition to this, low energy bulbs are much more complex to make than standard bulbs, requiring up to ten times as much energy to manufacture. Unlike standard bulbs, they use toxic materials, including mercury vapour, which the EU itself last year banned from landfill sites - which means that recycling the bulbs will itself create an enormously expensive problem.  Perhaps most significantly of all, however, to run CFLs economically they must be kept on more or less continuously. The more they are turned on and off, the shorter becomes their life, creating a fundamental paradox, as is explained by an Australian electrical expert Rod Elliott (whose Elliott Sound Products website provides as good a technical analysis of the disadvantages of CFLs as any on the internet).  If people continue switching their lights on and off when needed, as Mr Elliott puts it, they will find that their 'green' bulbs have a much shorter life than promised, thus triggering a consumer backlash from those who think they have been fooled.  But if they keep their lights on all the time to maximise their life, CFLs can end up using almost as much electricity from power stations (creating CO2 emissions) as incandescent bulbs - thus cancelling out their one supposed advantage.  In other words, in every possible way this looks like a classic example of kneejerk politics, imposed on us not by our elected Parliament after full consultation and debate, but simply on the whim of 27 politicians sitting around that table in Brussels, not one of whom could have made an informed speech about the pluses and minuses of what they were proposing."""
50532,Guest lundboy,2007-03-22 16:43:00,0," The EU has just passed a mandatory ban on conventional light bulbs....  It'll happen worldwide.  Global Cooling, Global Warming....  All comes from the same people.  There's an agenda on both.  Al Gore didn't put together ""An Inconvenient Truth"" just to save the planet.  Have a look at this video (watch the whole thing):  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XttV2C6B8pU  Then have a look at what Mr. Gore has been putting together in London (England)....  Setting up a ""Carbon Swap"" investment fund to make money from companies and people buying ""Carbon Credits"" once the UN mandates the Carbon Credit TAX System.  His movie will help push the legislation through.  http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2007/3411blood_n_gore.html  Sorry, I got all political there for a moment...."

50867,Guest lundboy,2007-03-23 15:24:00,0,Yep they do give off way less heat than a conventional bulb.  But man do they get hot!  I had one in an enclosed ceiling fixture (philips 17W) that was on for a couple of hours.  I decided that I would take it out and use it somewhere else and that bulb and ballast was AS HOT as any regular bulb!  To the point that the plastic on the ballast was sagging and yellowish brown.  I think everyone has to remember that conventional bulbs are made of glass and metal with a bit of epoxy or some other adhesive.  Those materials are made to withstand high heat.  Obviously the plastics covering the ballast won't/don't withstand the heat generated in an enclosed fixture.  Plus there probably is some kind of degradation of the gas inside the tube if it gets too hot without proper ventilation.  I know in my enclosed fixtures the CFL bulbs only last about 18 months without them being constantly on.
50944,Chris,2007-03-23 18:39:00,405,lundboy thanks for that link. Very interesting.
51027,Corey,2007-03-23 23:07:00,355,"Firing a ballast in a flourescent bulb or fixture uses approximately 6 hours of running power that the flourescent fixture consumes. If you have a 6w CFL and turn it in, it will use 24w just to fire the bulb. So if you turn on and off a CFL more than 4 times a day, you are better off to leave it on the entire 24hr period.  As well, until they can build a CFL that will withstand the cold of a Canadian winter, there should be no way that we are forced to use CFL's outdoors. They just aren't reliable in sub-zero temperatures.  Another hint is to find bulbs that have instant firing. You can get ones that ramp up to full brightness over a period of several minutes, or ones that fire to full brightness almost instantly.  cd."
51070,danc,2007-03-24 00:26:00,4677,"On a related topic, I heard on the radio today that Toronto home owners have become very efficient at conserving power. The new ""smart meters"" are working better than expected. So much better, in fact, that the revenues for Toronto Hydro are down so much that they have to jack up the rates to bring the revenues back up. Go figure..."

53179,Puckhead,2007-03-29 19:16:00,377, How can I determine which on is red and which one is blue?  I was at home depot the other day and I couldn't figure out what was what?  I want to give the red spectrum lights a try.
