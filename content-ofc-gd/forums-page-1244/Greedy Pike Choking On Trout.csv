52540,JEREMY,2007-03-28 01:24:00,300,Is that a pike or a tiger musky nice vid either way.
52554,love2fishhave2work,2007-03-28 01:56:00,212,Time  to increase the size of my lures when i pike fish.
52558,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-28 02:04:00,1351,my guess is tiger musky.. i wonder if anyone ever had their camera get bitten by a fish? haha
52579,ch312,2007-03-28 03:02:00,1590," my aqua vu camera has been in the mouths of 7 pike to date. must be the perch pattern on the cam...  i often hear of people being concerned that they are using lures that are too big but people should be thinking ""are my lures big enough?"" you often hear of people catching big bass on muskie lures, perch on 3-4"" minnows, and little walleye on big cranks...."
52583,Steelcat,2007-03-28 03:07:00,191,"I'm sure that pike eventually swallow that trout.  Always use big lure for big fish  I've caught a sunfish with a big spinnerbait, a crappie with a jerkbait an inch longer than it."
52592,Northhunter,2007-03-28 03:29:00,214,"Tiger musky.  A 3"" pike fingerling will take a baitfish (or another pike) that's 2"". They'll eat fish 2/3'rd's their length. Pretty incredible. I saw about a 5lb northern with a 2lb sucker in its stomach once.  I read a report on walleye where they were looking at feeding patterns. I think for part of the discussion they mentioned a mean prey length of 20% of total length (based on stomach analysis). My memory could be off, but if you apply that to fishing... I guess you could draw the conclusion that that a 25"" walleye could potentially pass up a 5"" rapala because it ain't on the super size menu"
52608,kissmybass,2007-03-28 04:21:00,36,"wow thats amazing... awesome video..  i few years back i was bringing in a small walleye and all of a sudden BAM, a nothern kicked the crap out of it.. got him near the boat and then he snapped off"
52650,ccmtcanada,2007-03-28 11:59:00,7971,Cool video!  Thanks for sharing it!
52654,mattyk,2007-03-28 12:02:00,2110,i think it was a tiger muskie. That was really cool. I once caught a pike that had a big mouse in its stomach. Gross.
