53052,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-29 13:15:00,1351,"i just went ahead and booked six mile ....  the boat is a small 12 footer, but i will be bringing the trailer along with it. for me, i'd rather have it more like a bush thing, but for my friends' sake, we're going with the shower and electrical."
53060,luv2drift,2007-03-29 13:42:00,147,there is next to zero pike in Algonquin Park.  If there are lakes with Pike they were introduced and the park is trying to rid the lakes of Pike.
53247,Big Cliff,2007-03-29 21:34:00,6899,I know a nice little lake up North that is loaded with pike and a 12' boat would be perfect on it but the only washrooms are a tree and the shower only works when it rains. If you do decide to do a more remote thing in the future let me know and I'll PM you directions etc.
