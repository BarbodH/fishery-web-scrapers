About a foot of water on top of thick ice in the shades, very thin ice where there are sunshine. Thin ice over Cook's Bay channels   Thin ice over Holland River   A yummy frozen dead carp~  I wish it was alive so I can catch it ><   Ahh all these ice >< I need to be patience until the ice melt~!"

53500,frozen-fire,2007-03-30 20:14:00,542,How long do you guys think it will take? A few more days? Oh geezz....i'm itching to be catching something...some nice spring slabs would be awesome!
53502,Steelcat,2007-03-30 20:22:00,191,"The problem right now is night time is below zero.  Even in downtown Toronto, there are thin sheet of ice in the morning.  Hopefully the rain that's coming on Sunday will be able to melt most of them.  But from the long range forcast temperature is going to fall again.... Hopefully the weather forcast is wrong as usual   I'd say give the water at least a week, probably two weeks.  Here is a pic of my jerkbait laying on a the thin sheet of ice this morning in downtown Toronto. "
53511,frozen-fire,2007-03-30 20:34:00,542,did you end up getting any pike downtown at least? hahaha
53515,Steelcat,2007-03-30 20:48:00,191,"Nope, nothing  At least I went out and had some morning fresh air"
