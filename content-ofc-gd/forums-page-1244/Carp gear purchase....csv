52801,tonyb,2007-03-28 19:36:00,1637,"Thanks Victor, I saw the Fox Stalker Pod at Fishing World and it looked pretty decent.  I need to review those compared to the Horizon and see what the differences are..  Yes the Shimano rods are 50% off at Fishing World - EXCEPT the Tribal $400 (Of course lol)  There are a lot of 2.5lb and 3lb Test Curve rods there still, just not the 2 3/4lb that I am specifically looking for.  I will try to support the businesses that represent CAG if I do have to order anything from the U.S.  Too bad they don't carry Delkim alarms around here, I like the looks of them and will probably order from Scorpion Tackle.  Otherwise the FOX EOS also looks decent.  Tony"
52814,Victor,2007-03-28 20:06:00,1609,"Are you sure that Tribals aren't part of the sale? When i saw them at the Spring Fishing Show they were on the $199. Even then, the Techniums are sexy enough to make me drool (i only have a nexave).  I think both MJL and Photoz here on OFC has the stalker so maybe they can give you more insight on it. (i'm not too sure about photoz though)  Good luck on your search!"
52836,wolfville,2007-03-28 20:56:00,396,"I think Photoz has the Horizon and MJL has the stalker. The main difference (other than Horizon has a few more adjustable parts) is that Horizon can be used in upright position (I think you need to buy some extension). But you don't really need to do that around GTA.  Again, in certain conditions long/stiff rods and big capacity reels are necessary. Other euro gears just make it easier and you can fish in style.  I really like my neighbor's Prosche, do I really need it to get to places? NO, but that would've been cool."
52889,Golfisher,2007-03-28 23:45:00,586," Why the hell does any of us need to buy more reels, more rods, more lures, and more of everything when all we need is just a bamboo pole and a hook tipped with some worm?  Sure you can catch carp without gong Euro, but then you won't hear the sweet sound of the bite alarm going off.  You may not care for that sound, nor see any point in it, but I, along with Tony and others on this board, do dig this stuff: different strokes for different people."
53048,tonyb,2007-03-29 13:07:00,1637,"Thanks wolfville, I thought having the option to go upright would be good for big water but I happened to bump into my buddies old man yesterday who is a Carp pro   He said that I would rarely require the upright set-up around here and in the popular Carp spots in Ontario.  Sounds like the Stalker will suffice.  Golfisher - Amen brotha!  Tony"
51034,glirw,2007-03-23 23:28:00,200,"There are lots of cheap alternatives to Euro-carp-gear . The bells and whistles just give a SLIGHT but not very significant edge , and are more comfortable .  A baitrunner is far from a necessiry . A spinning reel with its drag loosened up works just as well . Loosen up the drag , wait for it to start screaming , set the hook with your thumb on the spool , and THEN slowly tighten up  and fight the fish !  A carp rod is also not necessary . I still use , as my spare rod an  8 foot saltwater surf rod with an up to 3 OZ casting strength and a very slow tip . I casted many-a-doughball with that rod , and still do to this day when I take somebody fishing . Oh yeah , and the best thing is that it was $5 at the spring fishing show two years ago ! Ha  Instead of getting a pod , you can build something like this :    "
51057,dsn,2007-03-24 00:06:00,1018,I was at fishonline the other day. Maybe two weeks back. The store on jane. One of the guys offered me a package of used carp gear.  1) Fox Rod Pod holds 2 rods  2) 2 buzzers made by Fox and illumintaing swing arms.  3) bait rod  4) case for the pod  5) case for the buzzers  6) forgot if any fox rods where in the deal you'll have to ask. And baitrunner.  All for Under $300 bucks If your interested call them first and ask for Chris. I turned it all down. I don't want to carry all that grear. I like to travel light. My shoulders are hurting me now. Not sure if it was from last year though.  Great Deal though!!  This is Used equipment !!!   dsn
51975,tonyb,2007-03-26 15:43:00,1637,Thanks guys!  Can't wait to have a complete carp set-up that I can just grab and go in the summer evenings.  Tony
52609,wolfville,2007-03-28 04:22:00,396," Hmm....another one of us  I started carp fishing last year and I told myself not to get any of those toys. Today, after less than 12 months, I have a pod, bank sticks, 3 alarms, 4 bite indicators, a few carp rods of different kinds.... Imagine what you will have a year later if you are buying the whole set at the beginning.  None of the above is necessary for carp fishing, but they do make it more fun for me. I question myself very often that wether I enjoy the bite alarm screaming more or landing a 20lb fish....  The point is to have fun and learn to respect the nature, with any equipment you deem necessary."
52679,tonyb,2007-03-28 13:09:00,1637,You got it wolfville.  You CAN get by with other gear (and I have plenty that is up to the task) but I enjoy the modern carp fishing methods.  One trip is all it took to get me hooked!    Won't be long now! Tony
52728,joco,2007-03-28 15:23:00,57,hi tony b  nice carp picture bud.  hou got a pm.   joco
52757,Beans,2007-03-28 16:51:00,3339,"Can't afford all those new gadgets...this is what I use...  7 ft. Medium Ugly Stik spinning rod  Zebco6 Cardinal (Saltwater) spinning reel with large capacity spool  Berkly XT 17 lb. test mono.  20 inch horshoe pitching steel stake  36 inch (2 inch outside diameter) pvc pipe  Hammer stake firmly into ground on a slight angle towards area you are going to fish, slip pvc pipe over stake, cast out then insert handle of rod into pipe, take all slack out of line until the rod bends slightly,make sure drag is set a bit on the loose side, sit back and keep an eye on rod tip, let carp run with bait before lifting rod out of holder...most times it will set the hook itself...Haven't lost a rod to the carp gods since using this method...Crappieperchhunter's wife got a good laugh outta him and I jumping down a bank chasing after my rod before I started using this holder...      As mentioned earlier...this doesn't work very well on cement piers and Big Cliff doesn't like me to hammer stakes into his dock..."
52775,BITEME,2007-03-28 17:47:00,1969,??????????????? what the heck do you need all this freaky carp gear for i catch them on my normal everyday fishing gear and i garuntee(sic) you fishing side by side with all of the fancy crap you have and using my everyday crap using the same bait you arent going to catch more then me better ways to spend money even though im half british I see no need to fish the european way save your money  JUST MY 2 CENTS
52778,tonyb,2007-03-28 18:00:00,1637," You are right, and I could also use a 6 foot bass rod to catch Steelhead, but I don't.  The point is, if you haven't experienced Carp fishing with all the ""freaky Carp gear"" then you can't compare.  I don't disagree that you could catch just as many Carp on any other outfit (If they are close to shore), but similarly, I could catch Steelhead on a bass outfit, it's just not as enjoyable.  Like a mechanic, my rods (and reels) are my tools, and I have a specific rod for each specific fishing situation, with some rods being more general purpose (like an adjustable wrench)  It's pretty cool using the modern Carp fishing methods though, when I get my set-ups (Yes I am buying 2 - Carp fishing is a social activity  ) you should come out and try it.  Tony  UPDATE: I just visited Fishing World in Hamilton and they didn't have too many 2.75lb TC rods (1 Shimano Tribal @ $400)  Also, they didn't have the pod I was hoping to get.  It looks like I will be piecing together my set-up from different vendors."
52788,Victor,2007-03-28 19:05:00,1609,"what wolfville said.   tonyb: not sure if you know this already but shimano aren’t bringing any more carp rods to Canadaso what’s left in the stores are the last batch. I believe the Tribals are $199 @ FW as all carp rods are half priced. (originally priced at $399)  From your rod pod post on CAG seems like you’ve decided to get the Horizon? I was look at that and the Prologic Tripod not too long ago. If you have trouble finding a place that carries them, try Big Carp Tackle (American carp society store). I exchanged a few emails with the manager asking about shipping, got pretty good customer service and the price seems to be reasonable."
