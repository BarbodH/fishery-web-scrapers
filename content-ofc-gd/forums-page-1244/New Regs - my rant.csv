52994,camillj,2007-03-29 03:51:00,1988,It is too wierd .. already almost April and new regs still aren't out ... how the heck are supposed to plan for all the dumb exceptions without studying the regs during cabin fever time .... sheesh we're all liable to run out at first light and get our selves in a heap of trouble ....
52998,tjsa,2007-03-29 04:18:00,1578,"yeah, its taking a long time for sure, but from what I heard, its held up with the federal regulations, which the provincial regulations must also comply with, and they are having a bit of trouble getting all of that sorted out properly. Its gotta go through the provincial house, and the federal house, to get the legislation correct.  Just keep fishing, until you hear more. But it does make planning for the summer, or fall, a pain."
53005,Ron,2007-03-29 04:44:00,1683,"Last I heard it was still on Ramsey's desk. The 2 fish limit on trout and the 4 fish limit with only one over 18"" on Walleye for FMZ 17 are just a few of the changes that need to Federally approved."
53009,carp-starter,2007-03-29 05:52:00,253,"Our Ontario leader and lier probably has no money to buy paper to print the regulations on.  I have no respect for him. This delay is ridiculous.  A question one can ask is - ""who do you trust more - a used car sales man or politician McGinty?'  I would choose a used car salesman.  carp-starter"
53027,lilkynan,2007-03-29 11:38:00,173,Same deal for hunting regs - dont come out till after Turkey starts each year!!!
53032,pikehunter,2007-03-29 11:58:00,1659, Well at least you know where you stand with the used car salesman.
53035,Terry,2007-03-29 12:09:00,14456,"well they said the 2006 regs stand until the new ones are approved by the feds......  they have put out blurbs on the ones that have been implemented so far, so I don't see a problem..myself"
53045,tonyb,2007-03-29 12:59:00,1637,"I've heard if they aren't published by April 18th, they are being urged to wait until Jan 1, 2008 to avoid the confusion.  Who knows what they will do, I don't even think they know what they are doing.  Tony"
53054,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-03-29 13:18:00,0,"Oh god you can blame me for this one as well. Sort of.  It's the new "" lets stop Richard Collin from fishing in December "" exemption that needs federal approval as well as needing approval from the governor general and unfortunately she's out of town and hard to reach at times."
53057,misfish,2007-03-29 13:27:00,29133,2006 regs are to be used. This was anounced in December.
53061,bigfish1965,2007-03-29 13:45:00,3382,"With the exception of what was announced already, just keep going by the '06 regs. The current regs are sitting in Ottawa awaiting federal approval. The OFAH is indeed pressuring the government to delay implementation until next year if the new rules are not out soon. It appears ineptitude is not bound by political affiliation."
53065,Puckhead,2007-03-29 13:53:00,377,"  I think that's the problem...  If more effort was spent on it, it would be done by now but it's not a priority I suppose."
