52070,Pigeontroller,2007-03-26 19:46:00,2793,"I see lots of great looking boat projects posted here! Here's one of mine. I started this last year, but recently picked up a second rigger so I wanted to finish it off.  I wired it so all I have to do is put the bar and riggers on and plug it in.               "
52074,Sherriff,2007-03-26 19:49:00,252,Awesome work there.  Looks great..  Sherriff
52087,irishfield,2007-03-26 20:26:00,26272,Looks great Dax!!!
52093,douG,2007-03-26 20:41:00,2693,"Cabinet grade work there, Dax.  Very nice job."
52100,Puckhead,2007-03-26 21:10:00,377,Nice job... that looks great!
52105,snackpack5150,2007-03-26 21:18:00,79,Very nice work I am sure you be the envy at the launch this spring.  Tight lines and sharp hooks  Cheers Ken
52112,Smokey,2007-03-26 21:32:00,1278,"Nice work Dax, you did a great job."
52133,bpsbassman,2007-03-26 22:32:00,941,"I am extremely jealous of your storage facility (garage). Look at all those Musky lures too! Oh yeah, AWESOME job on the transom bar.  Its a piece of art!"
52252,ryanheritage,2007-03-27 12:57:00,180,"Looks good im stealing your idea for my downriggers lol.... did you need to use a ac/dc, dc/ac converter for your down riggers?"
52261,spooner_jr,2007-03-27 13:45:00,193,"It looks great.  You probably should cut the bolts down and cap them though, wouldn't want to fall on them if the water is a little rough."
52262,LeXXington,2007-03-27 13:50:00,1928,"Super Nice, One thing I found on mine that I built was having the riggers higher makes it much easier to rig up and deply. I see yours are bolted to the gunwalls, so it might be low to the water consider the pedistel mounts    When can I move into your garage,"
52264,caper,2007-03-27 14:05:00,210,Very nice..
52268,Guest mistyriver1,2007-03-27 14:21:00,0,Very nice Dax.
52324,SlowPoke,2007-03-27 16:34:00,2984,"You're allowed to keep your boat, tools and tackle in your kitchen? Nice job Dax, it matches your rod holder mounts nicely too. When are you going to pull the carpet and install hardwood floors? -Brian"
52470,Pigeontroller,2007-03-27 23:16:00,2793,"  No converter, downriggers run off the 12 v battery, two wire electrical cable required."
52471,Pigeontroller,2007-03-27 23:17:00,2793, I found some U-bolts that don't stick up past the top of the nuts!
52578,Pigeontroller,2007-03-28 03:00:00,2793,Thanks for the comments guys! Anyone nearby or passing through is invited to the Garage for cold beverages!
52621,lew,2007-03-28 08:19:00,12767,"Very impressive work indeed, Dax !!  It's always good to see the different projects folks take on over the winter."
52714,Garyv,2007-03-28 14:41:00,547,Very professional looking!
53214,AzuluSpookd,2007-03-29 20:41:00,348,"That is pretty amazing, great job!  I just purchased two electric big johns and am going to need to do something similar to my boat.  I just have no idea how to do the electrical part, I have a bud that is going to make me an aluminum bar to go across....so the electrical is the issue....  any suggestions/help?"
53302,Frankypro,2007-03-30 01:25:00,63,"I love it.  It's tidy, out of the way and removable for when your not down-rigging.  Great job.  Can I setup my appointment to bring my boat in say mid April.  LOL"
53322,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-30 02:15:00,835,Thats real nice but I would suggest a holder for a pair of needle nose pliers with sidecutters just in case. If you hang up a rigger in a strong following sea you got less than 3 seconds to cut that cable.
53577,fishindevil,2007-03-31 00:14:00,6254,"WOW....that sure looks great,and it will work perfectly..  ..well done    cheers"
