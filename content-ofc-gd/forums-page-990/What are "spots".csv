I was watching the Scott Martin Challenge t.v. show this morning and he was catching what he called as ""spots"" They look exactly the same as a largemouth. Is this a nick name or a slightly different species."
232190,Zubris21,2008-07-24 14:14:00,563,"I'm not too familiar with spots either,  I think its an southern subspecies of bass.  Do a search for some of greencoachdawg's reports, he always seems to have a few spots in his photos."
232196,Tdel,2008-07-24 14:24:00,393,You should be reading Greencoachdog's posts more often.  Tom
232201,Tdel,2008-07-24 14:28:00,393,Looks like you beat me to the punch freshwaterfanatic.  I should read a little more carefully.  Tom
232202,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-24 14:33:00,3761, O ok. Thanks for the quick show of GCD's fish. I guess that sums it all up.
232229,Fisherpete,2008-07-24 15:56:00,1814,Spotted bass. Very similar to Largemouth. Don't think we have them up here in Canada?
232287,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 18:21:00,8163,Google Micropterus punctulatus henshalli...   ... not to be confused with Micropterus punctulatus punc!
232417,Rich,2008-07-24 22:06:00,3927,I hear they fight a little harder than largemouth too.
232440,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 22:35:00,8163,"  Pound for pound, they are a stronger fish than a Largemouth because Spots prefer areas with current, whereas a Largie would rather have slack water if the forage is there. I do catch Spots and Largies in the same place, but the ratio is probably 5 Spots to 1 Largie.  Spotted Bass and Largemouth fight differently too, the Largies will come up close to the surface and jump to try to shake the hook free... while a Spot will bulldog for the bottom and try to break you off on rocks and wood, if they can't get to the bottom they will head for deep open water where they feel the safest.  I did have a Spot break water on me about a month ago and thought ""what the hell?""... asked him what he thought he was doing when I got him in the boat and he told me it was a trick a Largemouth taught him."
232513,misfish,2008-07-25 00:15:00,29133,NOW THAT WAS FUNNY. Even wasted a good spew of good ol Ale over that. Shame on you.
232522,BabyHerc,2008-07-25 00:38:00,285,"Spotted bass, aka Kentucky bass, native to southern USA."
232538,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 01:03:00,8163," There are actually 2 species of Spotted Bass:  Micropterus punctulatus punc... Northern (Kentucky) Spotted Bass  Micropterus punctulatus henshalli... Alabama Spotted Bass... these fish are native to the Coosa River that I fish, but have been stocked elsewhere."
232557,keram,2008-07-25 01:41:00,585,"Oh man, after reading this thread I was pretty sure that SPOT = Half Naked GCD  . I know that abbreviation does not match the description, but I'm working on it"
