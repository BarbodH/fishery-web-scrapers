Id like to catch some whitefish and lakers.  I tried the triple swivel approach drifting a few feet off the bottom with a Wabbler and a 1-2oz weight. Nothing even 3 hours in.  Reading lots and lots of arches right on the bottom....30 40 even 50 arches all over each other down around 80-100ft....can get them to bite.  What am I doing wrong? What else should I try?  Thanks guys!  Jack"
