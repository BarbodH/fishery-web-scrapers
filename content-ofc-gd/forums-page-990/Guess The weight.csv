232294,Cudz,2008-07-24 18:47:00,2652,No comment for now.  I am not offended.  I will get better pics. The 10 - 8 in the other pic looks longer but doesn't have the sme girth
232298,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 18:51:00,0, Hey Cudz. Why the heck would you get offended? You asked us to guess the weight.We are commenting on it. But like I said. Pics can be deceiving and he is a big guy. You never know.
232304,Cudz,2008-07-24 18:57:00,2652,
232305,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 19:00:00,0,Sorry if that comment offended you.  I'm just saying. There is a 10lb bass at the BPS store and it is HUGE!!!
232306,highdrifter,2008-07-24 19:01:00,2534,200lbs!!!  A beast more stomac than fish...  Who gives a flying hoot??  I'm with UA on this one...  You're just trying to get a rise out of us ain't ya boyee.  Nice fish though!!
232332,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 19:58:00,8163," 5'-10"" and 316 lbs. ... you tryin to set a good example for the fish Seaweed?"
232036,Grimace,2008-07-24 02:39:00,2020,"  its a beauty fish, but is there a photo of him holding it anywhere near his body.   lots of 3 pounders find there way into the nickel club that way,   just wondering if a 6or 7 is getting into the 9 club.  I am not a big doubter or a rain on the parade type person, but hey    when  the pics are tookin like that he is begging to make people wonder."
232039,Cudz,2008-07-24 02:41:00,2652,I will tell you the weight after I get the pic with his other fish beside it.  I will give you a hint.  He won the tournament on 2 fish.  The second place team caught 5 fish and weighed in 12 pounds 13 ounces. He lives in Penetang/Midland area. As suspected by Mikeh and Timmeh this fish is not Canadian
232040,misfish,2008-07-24 02:41:00,29133,"Im going with the 8 pound class,give or take a few ounces.. Very nice bucket non the less."
232041,forrest,2008-07-24 02:43:00,1032, I guessed 8lbs 8oz  ...I feel like I am on the price it right.
232044,forrest,2008-07-24 02:46:00,1032,  I place a full bucket of water in the boat.  Each big fish gets submerged and I measure the displacement.  My biggest bass is 3 litres
232049,Rich,2008-07-24 02:53:00,3927, LOL I bet the rougher the water the bigger the fish!
232053,Cudz,2008-07-24 02:59:00,2652,I was thinking the same thing.  If i push the fish in quickly more will come out.  lol
232055,RobHall,2008-07-24 03:02:00,261,7 pounds 14 ounces
232068,Rombo,2008-07-24 03:17:00,39,Out with the dam weight already !!!!!
232069,Cudz,2008-07-24 03:19:00,2652,No Guess the fish on my other thread first.
232072,e-z-out,2008-07-24 03:21:00,1052,10.2 thats my guess
232073,Rich,2008-07-24 03:21:00,3927,38lbs 10 oz
232077,Cudz,2008-07-24 03:31:00,2652,Ok fish officially weighed 9 pounds 6 ounces.  Before you start calling Bull take a look at my other thread called Guess this weight too.  Some of us are very good at guessing weights while others are not.  I know it is difficult with angles and everything else. Fish was caught in California during a recent visit.
232110,Terry,2008-07-24 10:39:00,14456,"well if you look at the tourney fish you can see the guy has his hand on the bottom lip and it's bigger then his hand  your fish, his hand is much bigger then the bottom lip, now your guy might be 6'11"" but from what I see your fish is a good 3lbs+ lighter then the fish on the stage....but pictures do lie"
232160,Seaweed,2008-07-24 13:13:00,135,Your buddy needs to check the scales.  That fish is not even a six pounder.  Can we see the results from the tournament?
232163,bucktail,2008-07-24 13:22:00,1857,6.8 pounds??
232164,Seaweed,2008-07-24 13:24:00,135,Ok here we go.  I'm 5 foot 10 and weigh 316  What does this one weigh then?    I can assure you that it wasn't a fiver.  Photos can be very deceiving.
232186,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-24 14:10:00,2050," Why do people always have to argue?!?! WHO CARES - if you don't think a fish is 9lbs or 2lbs or whatever just laugh to yourself and forget about it.  This website is all about people having fun, sharing stories and making friends, so I think some people need to get over themselves.  As far as guessing weights, I doubt there's more than a dozen or so people on this board who've even seen a 9lb + largie up-close and personal - so who are you to say it isn't 9lbs?  Anyways - that's my 2 cents.  Enjoy the pix, guess a weight here and there, give tips when you can and have fun.  Cheers, UF"
232197,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 14:24:00,0,That bass doesn't look 24 inches....22 max. And I don't think it breaks the 6 lb mark. But who knows. The camera can be deceiving. The other fish caught by Howell looks like it is about 24 inches and looks like it still has its last meal in its stomach...  Either way. Its a nice bass!
232200,MARK69,2008-07-24 14:26:00,24,I am gonna say 8lbs. 14 oz.
232257,addy79,2008-07-24 17:23:00,573,5.10lbs
232258,johnnyb,2008-07-24 17:25:00,3413,"I tried not to look at the other responses, but....I'm gonna say....it's freshly spawned....so does that mean it's skinny or putting on the feed?  skinny, I think....I'll say 5 lbs 14 oz.  When do we get the answer??!?!?!?!"
232266,Pachone,2008-07-24 17:36:00,276,TELLLLL US LOL  Id say 5.5!
232276,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-24 17:54:00,0,He already did! He said it weighed 9 pounds 6 ounces and was 24 inches if I am not mistaken. There is a 10lb largemouth at BPS that would swallow that thing whole almost.....
232282,johnnyb,2008-07-24 18:14:00,3413,"9,6!!!  Wow....that is crazy.... Thanks for keeping us posted, Johnny"
231997,Cudz,2008-07-24 02:12:00,2652,This is a pic of my friend who caught this bass last week. He had it officially weighed and I know the weight. Take a guess.  There will be a prize (or maybe not) By the way the fish was released. Just for reference the guy holding it is about 6'2 and about 240 pounds 
231999,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-24 02:14:00,3761,6.4lbs
232000,Rich,2008-07-24 02:14:00,3927,4.2
232003,wallyboss,2008-07-24 02:15:00,1095,It's  pretty close to a nickel!!
232004,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 02:15:00,8163,Thats a nice 3 pounder he's got there... what do I win???
232005,muskymike,2008-07-24 02:16:00,772,6 lb 9 oz
232006,Cudz,2008-07-24 02:16:00,2652,lol are you kidding?   This is a big fish. here is another pic that might help. just for reference the pic of the smallmouth in my avatar is 4 pounds. 
232007,forrest,2008-07-24 02:17:00,1032,I will guess his arms are short so he can't hold a fish too close to the camera: 6lbs 10oz.
232009,Rich,2008-07-24 02:18:00,3927,"Hard to tell when it's 3 inches from the camera. It looks short and stubby, like an 18 inch fish with a 60 inch girth, LOL"
232010,Joey,2008-07-24 02:19:00,9122,8.5
232011,PatrickGG,2008-07-24 02:19:00,562,6.7 pounds
232013,Rich,2008-07-24 02:21:00,3927,...5 lbs.
232015,Cudz,2008-07-24 02:22:00,2652,"Click on the pic itself to make it bigger.  The bass was 24"" and fat. Here is a pic of 7 pounder "
232017,Rich,2008-07-24 02:24:00,3927,Ahh well at 24 inches that makes the bass probably 7.2 with a girth like that.
232018,Grimace,2008-07-24 02:24:00,2020,6 lbs 1 oz   bass guys always have super long arms.   lol      its a beauty fish.   A little bend in the elbows would do both the fish and fisherman a little more justice.   funny but true
232020,keram,2008-07-24 02:25:00,585,2.5 lb
232023,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 02:26:00,8163," Have you ever heard of a thing called ""camera angle""?  Holding a fish all the way out at arms length is not the way to take a fish pic with a large fish... if you want folks to believe it's a large fish."
232024,forrest,2008-07-24 02:27:00,1032,"24"" you say?  Not your fish but compelled to tell the tale?  Those factors give it an 8lbs 8oz guess."
232025,timmeh,2008-07-24 02:28:00,609,Not looking for a specific location but where was the fish caught? Was it in Ontario?
232027,Cudz,2008-07-24 02:31:00,2652,"The guy is a big strong dude.  He is a pro bass fisherman and not a liar.  I know how big this fish is, it is registered.  It was in a tournament (club tounament).  There is another pic where he is holding this fish beside a 4.5 pound fish.  I will try and get it from him."
232028,mikeh,2008-07-24 02:31:00,824,"8 lbs 9 oz,did he catch it in canada?"
232030,GoneFishin,2008-07-24 02:34:00,349,I'm gonna guess 6lbs 3oz?? lol. I got a 19 inch and it was 5 on the line so thats got to be a heavy fish.
232031,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-24 02:35:00,3761,Cudz are you going to tell us the weight after somebody gets it right???????
232032,wallyboss,2008-07-24 02:36:00,1095,My wife keeps telling me that a camera adds about 20 lbs. But I would guess it adds only a couple of pounds in this one.  You got to wonder why people take pictures of fish so far away from the body. It's the oldest trick in the book when you want to add a couple of pounds to the fish. That's why I have a measuring guide in my boat. If I want to prove a length the picture is taken beside it.
232035,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-24 02:38:00,3761, Well i don't want fish slime all over my shirt.
