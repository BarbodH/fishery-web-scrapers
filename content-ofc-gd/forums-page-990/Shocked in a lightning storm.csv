230860,Mattones,2008-07-22 00:06:00,587,haha I was just thinking the same thing. They would find an empty boat though.   That was classic! Really classic! Sig worthy.  ----  Anyway as I am a Carpenter I have had my fair share of stuff happen. A few years back couple when I was working in a house during a thunder storm I could feel the lead in my pencil vibrating. It was a bit freaky.  Another time I was on my ladder doing some stuff. I layed the nailer on the ladder to cut a piece of wood and as soon as I finished cutting and turned around to walk back to the ladder I was blinded and found my lader about 2 feet away on the ground with the plastic all melted and smoking and the nailler outside on the gravel driveway. My boss was dropping the garage at the time and actually saw my gun fall. He said was gun my whitish blue when he saw it falling which caused him to look.  Lets just say that was a 700$ day haha. I hate working in a house with no windows since that day.
230861,ehg,2008-07-22 00:13:00,2666,Once in my early teens i was on the beach in Oshawa watching a storm approaching from the west. Watched the blackness approaching and counted the seconds between flash and thunder and guessed the brunt of storm was a mile away still. Suddenly there was a deafening crack as some lightening struck the beach 30 feet away from me. I was looking at area where it hit and saw a bunch of sand get kicked around. Went and looked at spot and the lightening left a figure eight about 3 inches deep and a little over foot long.  A few times fishing i've had braided line rise off water and graphite rods buzz and great fishing at the same time. Pretty scary stuff however. ehg
230940,Moosebunk,2008-07-22 02:58:00,3970,Those tables that used to have the aluminum band around the edge..... got my pops right across the belly while playing cards with his pilot buddies at the Perth airport... back in the day.  Lit his belt buckle up a little too.  Electricity that close to the nads... exciting stuff.  Don't mess with Zeus people... he'll throw a bolt in your Cheerio bowl some morning and kill ya dead.

231456,Fisherpete,2008-07-23 02:21:00,1814,"Danimal, the EXACT same scenario happened to me and my friend Patrick earlier this year (June). There was a storm well off in the distance, which didn't hit the area until a few hours later. My rod just started buzzing and felt like a lightsaber in my hand. Touching the eyelets gave off a nasty little shock. Let me tell you, we hightailed it off the lake as fast as possible. It scared the crap out of me. The fishing had been very good too - 2 muskies had been landed, 2 more lost that day, but we didn't even think about it for a second."
232145,cranks bait,2008-07-24 12:30:00,721,Dang lightning just struck again.  My wifes parents just lost two hoses when lightning stuck a tree right beside them the other night.
230256,camillj,2008-07-20 19:42:00,1988,"Two for me as well ... once was on a golf course when we were kids ... taking cover near a tree (before we knew better) ... heard nothing saw nothing ... but found ourselves about ten feet from our shoes (and the tree) face down in the mud ... dont think we were actually  hit but it was a long silence as we picked up our gear and assessed the damage to the tree behind us... not really any time to be afraid ... until afterwards ...   Second time was more scary ... I was in a boat at Waubaushene ...  the rod started buzzin right as the sky turned BLACK ... the storm had come out of nowhere .... I was about a mile from shore and though it wasnt rough, the lightening seemed to be everywhere) ...and  I was in a BIG STEEL TUB so I figured I was a goner for sure .. just wanted to be sure they found the body so I  dropped the rod, put on the life jacket and lay down as low as I could while I tried to outrun the storm to shore ... probably the wildest 15 minutes I can remember ... of course just about the same time I got to shore the storm had passed ... and I was still alive ... so.. like any self-respecting fishaholic  I had a quick bottle of courage and headed back out"
230585,DANIMAL,2008-07-21 14:17:00,215,Interesting stories and info. everyone. Thanks for sharing. And from now on I'm going for shelter as soon as I hear any rumbling.
230662,Bernie,2008-07-21 17:07:00,3190,"25 years ago I was swimming with a friend in a small lake east of Trout Creek. It was a beautiful sunny hot day. No approaching storm was heard or noticed. I was under water when lightning struck a tree on the shoreline about a 1/2 kilometer away. Wow, what a jolt.  I surfaced right away and seen my buddy become an instant Olympic swimmer heading for shore. One single black cloud was all there was and it didn't appear all that close. The sun was still shining brightly."
230668,cranks bait,2008-07-21 17:20:00,721," This happpened to my grandmother TWICE in the same kitchen.  Only difference was she had both hands on the sink and watched it go down the drain.  She still lives there, but her ticker is not the same."
230760,danbo,2008-07-21 19:40:00,2646,"How about the scene in ""Caddyshack?""      Play it safe!!"
230789,GBW,2008-07-21 20:25:00,8460,"I too have 2 times (well more but the memory is foggy) 1st time I was in my early teens on a golf course heading up to the green with a friend and pick up the golf balls and take off as the storm just blew in.  We were at the farthest point away from the club house too.  Well, that's when lightning hit the flag on the green less then 20 feet from me.  He said I looked like a cartoon with my legs going so fast as I sprinted back to the clubhouse with a nasty ringing in my ears.  I had dropped of my clubs at the car and was in the clubhouse almost done my snack and drink before he got to his dads car.  He was the fastest person in my school too...  The 2nd time I was in my early 20's looking out the sliding glass doors in the basement (we had a walkout basement) at the storm going on.  We backed on to a creek so the house was one of the higher spots around...  Needless to say lightning hit the house in a few spots and one was 6"" on the other side of the door where I stood.  I was launched clear across the room on my back.  I had no clue how I had done this either as I just missed hitting the pool table with my head.  I was up at the front doors trying to calm my dog before the deafening sound of the thunder clapped so I guess I was moving fairly fast.  Almost everything that was plugged in and on in the house was damaged as well.  Later we found 3 spots that the house was hit, where I was, beside the pool and the chimney as it needed to have 10 or so bricks replaced.  So, if it's raining, lightning is in the air and you see me running faster then Flash Gordon forgive me if I don't stop and say hello."
230809,BassMan11,2008-07-21 21:09:00,583,"About 4 years ago my dad and i walked a canoe back into a lake/pond where we had never been before near 9 mile lake. Fishing was great, catching LMB hand over fist when a storm came out of nowhere. We paddled to shore to take cover under a tree (only option). I bolt hit about 30 yards away right in front of us. shook the ground and we were able to even see the width of it. Closest i ever want to be. But at least the fishing was good"
230821,Gerritt,2008-07-21 21:52:00,6129,We were a little concerned yesterday evening... Luckily no lightening.. but it certainly felt as though it could have @ anytime..    G
230842,mistaredone,2008-07-21 23:06:00,913,By the looks of that pic id be more worried about ghost pirate ships lol
230848,Greencoachdog,2008-07-21 23:36:00,8163,"Whenever you feel that buzzing in your rod, you're supposed to lay it down in the bottom of the boat, sit down and put your head between your knees...      ... so you can kiss your   good-bye!!!"
