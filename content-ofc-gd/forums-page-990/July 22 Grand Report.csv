The weather was perfect, cloudy, not too windy and not a single drop of rain. I fished for 5 hours and caught 3 nice catfish,(3-5lb) 1 silverbass that weight almost a pound, and a nice walleye I kept for dinner.      22"" 3.12lb I found a tag on the fish, is there a website I can enter the 6 digit codes?  If anyone's interested I would love to meet some of the Grand River area OFNers, there's a lot to learn about the river as this was my 2nd visite."
