It was a crayfish that could pass for a lobster, thing was huge.   Once I let the fish go, I had to clean up my dance floor.  I threw all the chunks overboard.  After about half a second a huge bass came up and engulfed the chunks I threw over.   I gave my head a smack, you know the V8 smack, I should have kept it as bait.  Is it legal to do this?"

232212,GoneFishin,2008-07-24 15:08:00,349,NOTHING will catch smallies better then live crayfish! I've never seen a smallie turn one down. They hit the water and the bass eat it before they get a chance to barely look at it.
