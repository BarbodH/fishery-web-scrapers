232218,k-max,2008-07-24 15:27:00,20,"Does anyone know where my best bet would be to go somewhere around Bancroft or Apsley Ontario to catch Walleye?  Not looking for anything huge, just somewhere with decent numbers?  I know this is mainly a bass area of ontario, but wondering if there is something around a 1 hour drive from that area?  I used to fishing the east end of the kawarthas (Stoney Lake) and found that it was really heavily overfished...  Any thoughts?"
232219,GBW,2008-07-24 15:30:00,8460,"How close are you to Baptiste Lake?  That area is good, well it was 2 years ago..."
232241,Bitsmith2k,2008-07-24 16:35:00,396," its good if you want lots of pike..  we've fished that lake tons and only seen one dinky walleye.. that said i've seen reports on here with some good walleyes from baptiste, so we're more than likely doing something wrong.."
232262,k-max,2008-07-24 17:29:00,20,"ive heard the walleye population in baptiste is really depleted, and only survives due to the stocking program?"
232269,GBW,2008-07-24 17:45:00,8460,"yes and no, there are still some breeders in there.  like I said, there was last time I was there 2 years ago.  Yes, lots of pike too..."
