232207,Garyv,2008-07-24 14:59:00,547,"Well after the death a few weeks back  of my fishing buddy Amy, my dog, I wasn't sure about getting another friend.  Found I missed the companionship and work of a dog ( as always happens ) so on Tuesday evening, while all the storms rage around Southwestern Ontario, we drove the hour and a half to Mitchell to see Dixie a 7 Mo. old border collie......She left her old home with us in my truck shortly after we got there.  I'm hoping to bond with her over the next few weeks and hopefull will have her for years and years.  You never can replace a dog you loose but can surely give the love to another.  Here are a few pictures.      "
232211,Headhunter,2008-07-24 15:03:00,5703,She's a beauty Gary! I hope she has eyes for smallies that Amy had. Congrats. HH

232222,John,2008-07-24 15:35:00,2956,"Congrat's Gary, she looks like a wonderful friend."
232228,fishnsled,2008-07-24 15:55:00,3520,Great looking boat buddy Gary!  Congrats.
232233,steve_paul,2008-07-24 16:04:00,658,Nice looking dog Gary.  Hope you and Dixie have many great adventures together.
232234,Rich Clemens,2008-07-24 16:08:00,3131,Good deal Gary.    I think Ruth was telling me about Amy while we were together up at Lakair.   Sorry to hear about your loss as I too just went through it.  Gotta get her trained for those fishing outtings.

232297,Beans,2008-07-24 18:51:00,3339,"How's your throwing arm my friend ?  She has that ""play fetch"" look about her...  Here's to many years of friendship..."
232319,RangerGuy,2008-07-24 19:30:00,564,Cute dog! Congrats! Hope she turns out to be a good girl for ya.  Our previous dog was a border collie cross.. She lived to 22 years and I still feel she wasn't around long enough  Our 4-legged friends just don't stick around long enough that's for sure!
232341,danc,2008-07-24 20:18:00,4677,"Gary. Three years ago I adopted a 7 month old female Border. She is my best friend now. A Border Collies intelligence will simply amaze you. You don't have to teach them how to do things, because they understand English. I'll venture to say that if you have this dog for several years, and for some reason you decide to get another dog, it will be another Border. Have fun with her Gary.  "
232342,Whopper,2008-07-24 20:21:00,2174,Congrats Gary she is a beautiful new friend
232363,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 21:07:00,8163,She looks just like my baby Gary!!!  I gotta warn you though...  ... they like to eat mud!!!
