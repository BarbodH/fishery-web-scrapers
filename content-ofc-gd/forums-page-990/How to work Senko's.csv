231393,timmeh,2008-07-23 00:59:00,609,"I personally usually use 5"" for bass. I think they have more action when rigged wacky compared a smaller 3-4""."
231398,issamhay,2008-07-23 01:05:00,77,"do the 5"" really have that much more action than the 4"", cause i only bought the 4"" versions...i hope not"
231406,timmeh,2008-07-23 01:13:00,609,"I really don't know for sure if the 5"" have that much more action. I'm relatively new to senko fishing myself and this is just my thinking, and I may be wrong. I have some 4"" too and have caught fish on them so I'm sure you'll be fine."
231421,oncogene,2008-07-23 01:30:00,154," Not sure about action, but i use 5"" coz it's bigger, ie heavier and so I can cast it further away. I guess it's not a factor for ppl fishing from boat, but i'm only from shore. And also, 4"" and 5"" cost the same anyway, I think"
232318,BillsTheBassMan,2008-07-24 19:29:00,932," I have had my best luck with Gary Yamomoto 5"" Senko in natural colours.  I have tried thinner senkos, and do not get as much interest."
