Couple more weeks and we'll be on our way to Temagami/Algonquin with three generation in the boat/car. Algonquin is clear, Temagami's Bass and lakers as well, BUT how to catch some Temagami eyes is what I'd like to know about. Could not get any last August but sure hope to get some now. We'll be there second week of August and then back to Algonquin for the rest of the month. I'll have the boat with all trolling gear in it. Plannin to camp around Racoon Point (strategic place with easy access to all three parts of the lake). Hope someone can share some of their secret eyes catching strategies;-) Feel free to PM me. Can also exchange for salmon catching info on Lake O.  And Wayne, I know you may not read this right away but I'll call you right before we leave. I'll make sure we stop at your place on the way to our spot.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
