231666,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-07-23 17:31:00,0,"Hey guys,  What is so special about this ""Gary Yamamoto"" baits?  It does not look special and doese not smell special ..  Commends?"
231711,Cudz,2008-07-23 18:35:00,2652,It is one of the originals. There must be something in the ingredients because a Pro Bass buddy of mine won't use anything but.  He swears he gets way more hits.
231717,fishinggeek,2008-07-23 18:41:00,325,"I think it's much softer too, so it probably quivers more (and breaks more).  Considering they don't last and the far higher prices, they really are much more expensive than comparable brands.  I've had good luck with the Yum brand myself."
231746,aniceguy,2008-07-23 19:33:00,1094,2 things  its softer and sinks quicker...for stick fishing nothing compares
231756,cranks bait,2008-07-23 19:45:00,721,I've never had luck with those bait.  I prefer the ones from my local tackle shop.  Although my brother in law swears by yamamoto's?
231757,MrMike,2008-07-23 19:51:00,153,IT is their action and that they are very heavly salted witch makes them far better to use weightless(salt makes them sink)
231768,Garry2Rs,2008-07-23 20:01:00,1425,"A 5 inch Senko weighs 3/8 of an ounce.  The plastic is, as previously noted, very soft. They are loaded with salt.  That, some people say, is why they tear so easily. Yes they work and yes, they are expensive...but so is the tournament entry fee. There are many other excelent brands, like Yum and Zoom, to choose from. For everyday fishing trips, I also use a lot of the no-names from my local tackle store."
231771,Musky or Specks,2008-07-23 20:09:00,2710,Yamamoto is all I use they are so soft. I put one in my mouth chewed it up and swallowed it on a bet and it didnt taste half bad so fish have got to like it and hold on to it.
231827,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-23 21:38:00,3761, Kudos to Yum.
231830,Rich,2008-07-23 21:41:00,3927,"They're expensive for the same reason Maple Leaf is more money than President's Choice.. you're paying for a name, and falling for the hype that they are softer and more salted than any other.  Try BPS Stik-O's."
231843,aniceguy,2008-07-23 22:10:00,1094,been fishing stick o's for a long long time and while yup they work no where close to the  senko bite.....
231899,aplumma,2008-07-23 23:55:00,6896,Drop the Senco into an aquarium and then drop the others and you will see the action of  the senco quiver as it falls. It is different from all of the rest of the knock offs. While they all will catch fish it is the senco that seems to come out ahead on the fish count. Are the few extra fish you catch worth the price is up to you to decide.   Art
231904,brickNblock,2008-07-24 00:05:00,598,Well said ART........ If I need that type of bait I buy his brothers..... Its still a Yamamotto bait ..but $2-3 cheaper.. I buy these from Gagnon's in Oshawa. They are on the same shelf and are...... 'side by each'......
231922,Daplumma,2008-07-24 00:33:00,1961,Sencos are the real deal.If the bite is hot you can use the knock offs but I always start off with Sencos. Joe
231947,mikeh,2008-07-24 01:10:00,824,I found this on youtube showing different plastics in a tank  
232054,e-z-out,2008-07-24 03:00:00,1052,"GYCB baits are heavily salt-impregnated using a patented process. As an alternative, other manufacturers may coat the outside of their baits with salt, but this is an ineffective process that quickly dissolves the surface salt off of other vendors' baits in water, and does not have any value as far as the surface salt being a fish attractant. On the other hand, GYCB baits are impregnated with salt and there is always some salt within the bait at all times. Even take a bait that you have been tossing all day - roll the plastic between two fingers and feel all the salt crystals that come out of the bait. That's exactly what a fish tastes when it crushes down on the bait. Also, for those who like to soak baits in scent overnight, the surface-most impregnated salt will dissolve overnight, leaving tiny micro-pockets on the entire bait surface that fill up with the scent. This gives you a heavily scent-saturated bait overnight.  Yamamoto baits contain zero petroleum based oils, ""The oils that we use (this is kind of the secret part) are both biodegradable and contribute to the taste or overall effectiveness of the bait, based on the opinions of the final judge in these matters, the fish."""
