231651,bassmastermike,2008-07-23 16:13:00,295,"  Well first off i would like to thank everyone who responded to my first post about my new motor. I started my treck about 4 weeks ago looking for some more power for my boat i really wanted to go with a 4 stroke but i wasen't sure about the prices so i started calling dealers to see how much i was up against. Not much finding used at the dealers this time of year so i started checking Kajji smart shopper and Craigs list. Low and behold i found the exact motor that was rated for my boat back in 1989 150 HP Blackmax and she was a sweet motor too But it was a 1991 oil injected 2 stroke. The person selling it ended up being Chris Kontos an ex NHL hockey player what a great guy!! He took me out for a water test and the motor ran great so i I gave him a deposit for the motor. He needed 1 more week with the motor due to the fact he had company so i said no problem and made a date in a week to pick up the motor. Here is pic.....   <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/?action=view¤t=DSC03164.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/DSC03164.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a> Next off was the day i was picking up the motor so i gave chris a call , he said he had a problem  the motor he got was a long shaft but he needed a XL shaft so he asked me if i wanted the motor i told him i couldent afford it he said he would take a loss on it and only charged me 700.00 more then he was chrging  me for the black max so i told him sure and drove back to Pennitang to pick it . My New Motor is a 2002 115 Murcury EFI Four Stroke and man does she FLY Here is a Pic    <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/?action=view¤t=DSC03212.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/DSC03212.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  I took it out on the water for the maiden voyage yesterday after getting the Jack plate and prop set up and it does a cool 51 MPH which is great for what im looking for.  Here are a couple before and after shots with the two different motors BIG difference if you ask me .Also i am selling the 70hp Evinrude for a reduced price to OFC'rs for 1400.00 Power trim and tilt and controls Cheers BMM   <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/?action=view¤t=DSC03217.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/DSC03217.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a><a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/?action=view¤t=DSC03210.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/DSC03210.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a><a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/?action=view¤t=DSC01414.jpg""'>http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/?action=view¤t=DSC01414.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/DSC01414.jpg""'>http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/DSC01414.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/?action=view¤t=DSC01414.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa311/mkilroe/DSC01414.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"

231849,Cudz,2008-07-23 22:26:00,2652,That motor looks to be almost a perfect fit for that boat.  4 stroke is a nice option as well.  Vey nice. I teach Chris' son at school.  Look for this kid to make it to the nhl as well.  Big kid. Very coordinated and strong.  Dad has a good head on his shoulders and the kid does well in school.
