231963,Wild,2008-07-24 01:37:00,704,"Funny but I have been researching some inflatables today and the better ones are not bad boats, some of you guys are just dramatic that's all. I am looking at a sea eagle inflatable and I see that bass pro sells them, 3 year warantee to boot- of course you guys will say if you last that long haha  CTC, phhh why bother shopping there, the return policy is getting worse."
231969,misfish,2008-07-24 01:44:00,29133,"Hmmmm ,maybe some of us feal, it,s safer to buy a cheap 12ft tinny that is safer then a BALLOON BOAT. The Zepplin comes to mind,and yes, they did say the Titanic was unsinkable too.LOL I,ll take the Titanic any day."
231977,Wild,2008-07-24 01:50:00,704,"HAHA but these things do have more than 1 air chamber, and the good ones will bounce off rocks with perhaps a scuff on it. I am looking at the pros and cons and these do fit the purpose in many cases."
231981,Rich,2008-07-24 01:59:00,3927,"They are safer than canoes and kayaks IMO. You just have to know your limits. Think of it like having a float tube. You wouldn't take a float tube in heavy current or areas with boat traffic, and you'd never travel in a float tube without a life jacket (at least I hope you wouldn't). The same general rules should apply to an inflatable boat.  The exception is the Zodiac style boats which have heavy, hard floors and are rated for high horsepower engines. I see guys using them out of Port Dover on Lake Erie all the time. They actually seem pretty stable. I still prefer my 14' tinnie or my 10' car topper but if storage is an issue, inflatable is a good viable alternative."
232034,boatman,2008-07-24 02:37:00,350,"I use 12' Zodiacs at work and own a few aluminum boats. I can tell you that a hard bottom Zodiac is much more stable than a small aluminum boat. They are very safe. More so than a tin boat. However, even the 12' Zodiac seems a little too small for fishing anymore than one person. They also plow water and are harder to plane. I'd rather fish from an aluminum boat, but a Zodiac is a good boat. Now, an inflatable rubber tub like CTC sells is suited for only a very few uses and I wouldn't put ""primary fishing vessel"" at the top of that list."
232155,holdfast,2008-07-24 13:03:00,1813,"Here's my  Take.  I used one for many years when I was posted in BC.  Worked Great.  If you are not afraid of the water, wear a life Jacket, ditch your Boots, you'll be fine.  I caught awesome cutthroat trout that I would of never gotten too as it would take a three hour hike up a mountain to Paradise.  Without that cheap inflatable, I would of just had a picture of a lake instead of life experience fishing.  Some people only feel safe in a titanic, yea some of you are over Dramatic.  GO for it, just make sure you have more than two chambers."
232170,bfong07,2008-07-24 13:32:00,13,"I have an Intex Mariner and can vouch for its safety. The craft is about 12' long and has 4 air chambers plus an inflatable keel that keeps it very stable even in choppy water. There is a hard floor of wooden slats and 2 people can fish in it, even standing up. As for getting swamped by the wake of bigger boats, it doesn't happen. The things just rides up and down on the waves. The rubber it is made of is awesome very sturdy and is formed by 3 overlapping layers. It awesome as a hard plastic bumper all around. I've had it ram into docks, branches and rocks without coming close to puncturing. Just make sure you don't over inflate, as the chambers have some ""give"" when they hit anything and this prevents it from puncturing. This is a very well-made inflatable (it weighs over 160lbs with a 55 lb-thrust electric motor and battery). The only drawback is that due to its shape, it isn't very fast, so I wouldn't take it any great distance from shore if there's a chance that I'll need to get back quickly. In good weather and light wind, it's absolutely fine, and especially great for shallow weedy lakes. It's no bass boat, but for a budget price, it'll let you access places you can't fishing from shore."
232380,dim.,2008-07-24 21:32:00,16,"I used to fish on HF280 Sevylor with 3Hp Yamaha. Yes it has limitation and yes you may get wet from waves. That's all. I fished Simcoe around Lefroy and Cooks Bay no problem. I even seen one in WF area  in the calm day. But think about portability 30lb + 40lb + 1L of gas  Plus you can fill it with water and stay afloat. And now I have bigger boat but still inflatable and consider it safer than any small metal boat. Try that with a small aluminum boat http://rib.net/forum/attachment.php?attach...mp;d=1210953021  PS Benti_11, I sold 3hp motor but still have Sevylor HF280 with extras PM me if you decide to buy one."
230849,Benti_11,2008-07-21 23:36:00,13,"Has anyone bought one? i see there cheap and in my price range, im not a huge fisher just like to have fun.  it also has a potential 9hp electric motor.  Is it worth it or should i save up for something real?"
230851,lookinforwalleye,2008-07-21 23:45:00,4399,save up for a real boat!
230852,misfish,2008-07-21 23:51:00,29133,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Do not buy one of these things. I had a conversation today with a gentleman at the local CTC and he was talking about buying one so him and his son could get out on the water. I asked him,how much do you love yer son? He got the pic after a bit of a informative session. THESE ARE NOT BOATS. He totally aggreed  even a 12 ft tin banger would be so much safer. Please do not buy one of these. They are not worth it. THEY ARE DEATH TRAPS WAITING TO HAPPEN."
230853,misfish,2008-07-21 23:53:00,29133,"CHEAP,THAT SHOULD BE THE FIRST CLUE."
230859,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-22 00:06:00,3761,"Hey i have had one of these for years now. I have never owned a ""regular boat"" before. Yes they are cheeper in price but as long as you do not stand up in them with 4 people and jump from side to side you will be fine. The good thing is that these boats have many chambers of air. Mine has 6 different chambers so this way if a hole does get punched in the boat you will have other chambers that will hold air and get you home safely. As these boats tend to be wide they are hard to tip over, hey with the right safety gear and the right precautions you will enjoy one of these for years to come.  Here are some pictures from last year of mine.     "
230867,misfish,2008-07-22 00:29:00,29133,Awe to be young again.LOL
230868,danbouck,2008-07-22 00:33:00,4380,I have one and love it. I take it down the grand rubbing against rocks the whole time and have never had a problem!

230947,John Bacon,2008-07-22 03:17:00,3277,"I have a Sea Doo inflatable with a 2.5 hp Nissan.  I am happy with it.  It is great for getting into the back lakes.  Inflatable boats are quite stable.  Most have multiple air chambers so you can still float with a leak.  I am not sure about putting a 9hp motor on a ""cheap"" inflatable though.  most of the cheaper boats are only rated for a couple of hp."
230949,Rich,2008-07-22 03:19:00,3927,"They are great for SMALL WATERS! Don't go anywhere where gas motors are allowed, one little tinny drives by and you'll be swamped.  Otherwise, jump in, wear your PFD and have fun. I wouldn't stick a gas motor on one.. a little electric will do just fine."
230960,Musky or Specks,2008-07-22 03:48:00,2710,Buy a jon boat they are cheap to and way better fishing platform
231017,bow slayer,2008-07-22 12:38:00,1074,what type of inflatable are you talking about? The ones that are a couple hundred bucks at CTC or Zodiacs with the hard floors(around 1500 dollars and up).  I am considering buying a 9ft inflatable (Zodiac) with a hard folding plastic floor to put my 6hp on to get into some small back lakes. It is rated for a 20hp.
231020,modny,2008-07-22 12:47:00,502,get a pontoon  
231049,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-22 13:39:00,2050," I second that option - pm me if you think it may be an option...  cheers, UF"
231078,Nailzz,2008-07-22 14:40:00,6,"Does anyone have expeirence with the West Marine RU 260 dinghy?  It would be considered mid range for inflatables i think.  Not the cheap style from CT, but not a full hard floor (it has wooden slats for support)  I am thinking of picking one up and putting an electric motor on it for small water fishing."
231082,bbog,2008-07-22 14:53:00,665,Have you considered a used canoe? Small investment and very versatile.
231083,danbo,2008-07-22 14:53:00,2646,Buy a used canoe or kayak. If you have storage space. Is everyone too weak to paddle these days???
231214,Nayyer,2008-07-22 19:24:00,7,"I along with my son using Zodiac kind of 10' inflateable for the last four years with a small gas motor. Never had a problem. With hardfloor I don't have any problem to stand and fish. However, always put my lifejacket and other safety measures on and remain in small waters. I always keep an eye on weather condition as well. As regards almunium boats, no one can guarantee that those will not sink. But remember Zodiac kind of boat are expensive. It is good to have one if you don't have space to park your boat.  Regards Sardar"
231287,Benti_11,2008-07-22 21:45:00,13,"thanks again, im not sure what im going to do, but its only for small lakes around st catharines, so i dont think its to bad"
231337,danbo,2008-07-22 23:43:00,2646,You asked for our opinions..you got 'em..
231341,misfish,2008-07-22 23:52:00,29133,"I only said what I said ,as I have seen alot of these boats up here. All for a fish  and seen what happens to them and  it scares the crap out of me. I have even left from a fishing spot, so I dont have to wittnwess any mishaps that can happen. Some may feel comfortble in them,but I still feel, solid under yer butt is much safer. If I had a scanner,I would show you a couple of pics of 4 guys heading out on lake ""O""."

Kayaks & canoes are the way to go, if money is a problem most manufacturers will sell used or ones with cosmetic defects at a significant discount.  Unfortunately I was looking for something to carry on a motorcycle......and still haven't found anything you can fish from."
