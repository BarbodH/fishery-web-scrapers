I rig 2 hooks about 10"" apart and the bottom hook is about 18"" from my 1/4 oz weight.  Fish love them.  I have caught sunfish, rock bass, perch, and smallmouth bass on them.  I rig up the kids rods with them and I no longer need to use live bait!!  I am serious.  I use the pearl white colour and size 2 red octopus hooks. I caught a 17"" smallmouth from the shore yeaterday on this rig.  The other day while fishing from a dock I caught 17 fish in 19 casts (nothing huge but perfect for the kids).  just want people who have a hard time getting live bait to try this option.  Each little bait will catch about 7 or 8 fish before it becomes totally destroyed. Here is a pic of 3 different colours.  give them a try.  I know this sounds like a commercial but I am really impressed with this product. "
