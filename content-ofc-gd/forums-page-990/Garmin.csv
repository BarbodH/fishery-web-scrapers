231684,Terry,2008-07-23 18:05:00,14456,"so the rubber cover for the usb plug on my Garmin GPSmap76 cs came off and was gone and  had trouble getting one ordered at the store I bought it from so I emailed Garmin on the email link on their website..  I had to give them my name, phone and address and what not..just to ask  what is the part number and where I can buy one of these little things,,I hate giving out info, but it was simple enough...  So a day later I get a reply from them  We are  sending you the part, thank you for being a customer ..  dang..a day later it shows up  at my house by courier  free...out of there own pocket  dang you can't bet that............  and I  loved their products, before this...now...wow       it's great that there are still companies like this one out there"
231689,BillM,2008-07-23 18:13:00,17367,There is a nice fella by the name of Mark who represents Okuma in the US.  I purchased it from JB's and noticed on a US message board he was offering a free power handle.  I PM'd him and asked if that offer was extended to his Canadian customers.  1 week later I got a new power handle in the mail  Can't beat companies that do that little extra for ya...
