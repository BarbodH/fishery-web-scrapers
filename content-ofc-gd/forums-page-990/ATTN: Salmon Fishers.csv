Its supposed to create a positive ion control, attracting fish, instead of repelling.  Has anyone been using these, with or without success?  Thanks"

232114,silveradosheriff,2008-07-24 10:47:00,1025,I use them as well - don't seem to be any better or worse than other set-ups.
232153,anders,2008-07-24 12:53:00,1168,"Thanks for the info guys.  I want to give them a try.  Fishndevil, i will send you a pm shortly.  The reason i ask is that up north here on Superior, in Wawa at the mouth of Michipicoten River, we are only allowed to run 1 rod each, so we dont have the option to run dipsy's, planners, etc.  However, 90% of the success comes on Flashers and flies, or flashers and herrings (flashers, spin doctors, dodgers, and ab n al's), not straight spoons or plugs.  So, anything that is a little different always helps."
232252,NANUK,2008-07-24 17:13:00,797,"I have caught a lot of salmon on E-Chip flashers, I've also caught a lot of salmon on many other brands too, so I can't say that E-Chip works better then the rest, but it definitely works!! I would say, try it, its the same price, what have you got to loose."
