We bought five tickets each at a dollar a pop. The follow- ing week, when the raffle was drawn, we each had won a prize.  I won 1st place- a year's supply of gourmet spaghetti sauce and extra long spaghetti.  GreencoachDawg won 6th prize- a toilet brush.  About a week or so had passed when the we met back at Wal- Mart. GreencoachDawg asked me how I liked my prize, to which I replied, ""Great!, I love spaghetti!""  I asked GreencoachDawg, ""How 'bout you, how's the toilet brush? ""Not so good,"" replied GreencoachDawg, ""I reckon I'm gonna switch back to paper."""
