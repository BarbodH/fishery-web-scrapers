232281,johnnyb,2008-07-24 18:12:00,3413,This clip has almost attained European Pike status....or maybe Siamese Pike status....still don't get tired of watching though
232283,kemper,2008-07-24 18:15:00,2232,interesting...   except we just watched someone die
232285,johnnyb,2008-07-24 18:18:00,3413,"no, apprently nobody died...which is miraculous...but this was all over the news a few weeks back, and it seems to be well documented that there were no fatalities.  Think about what would have happened if the pumps were busy....truly amazing nobody was killed"
232286,nautifish,2008-07-24 18:19:00,1416,"This clip was posted a week or so back. Beleive it or not the person driving the truck actually walked away unscathed.  Remarkable really, someone was for sure watching out for him that day thats for sure."
232288,e-z-out,2008-07-24 18:22:00,1052,  Here are the pics of the truck and trailer and shop after.
232290,cranks bait,2008-07-24 18:26:00,721,"I'm going to take a wild guess that the driver was not wearing their seatbelt.  The way the cab is crushed, that's the only way they could've gotten out of the way enough.   The beginning of the credits say it all, ""you lucky ba....."""
232291,kemper,2008-07-24 18:41:00,2232,youd think with the price of gas they could build a station that didnt fall over like a cheap house of cards
232299,modny,2008-07-24 18:52:00,502,""" IF YOU CANT DODGE IT, RAM IT! """
232399,fishindevil,2008-07-24 21:48:00,6254,Yes i seen that on the news a few days ago!!!!!...i wonder how much that cost him ???? LOL..LOL.. at least no0 one was hurt
232445,MuskyBill,2008-07-24 22:40:00,311,"It wasn't a gas station, it was a bank."
232453,Rich,2008-07-24 22:47:00,3927,"Sheesh, shows how much work goes into construction these days!"
232512,keram,2008-07-25 00:13:00,585,"After seeing it again, I'm really not sure weather I've seen three times the same truck and camper or the same gas station.   Burrrrp"
232540,Wild,2008-07-25 01:04:00,704,Some pics
