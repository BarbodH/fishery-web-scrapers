232127,bow slayer,2008-07-24 11:48:00,1074,"what exactly will this power. CTC has a 950 w  2 hp  generator on sale at the CTC store here in St,Thomas for 99 bucks. Will this be enough to power a tent trailer to run a few lights and a small RV fridge? It would be great to have power for the trailer when a hydro hook up is not available.  thanks  for any advice."
232136,John,2008-07-24 12:06:00,2956,"Certainly lights, probably a small RV fridge, lap top, charge cell phone etc. Add the the power requirements of what you want to run. Bear in mind that cheap is usually noisy, quiet is expensive. Some of the some units are also 2 cycle."
232137,John,2008-07-24 12:06:00,2956,"Oops, I meant to say some of the small units are 2 cycle..."
232144,Terry,2008-07-24 12:26:00,14456,"well 950...peak so 800 running full out so 700 watts is closer to what this baby will do putting out 120 volts lets say 110 to make it look better so 700 watts @ 110 = 6.36 amps   Air conditioner – 15,000 BTU	12.5 amps Hand vacuum	 2 amps Refrigerator	 2.7 amps Electric frying pan	10 amps Electric water heater – 8 gal.	12.5 amps Iron	10 amps Microwave oven	12.8 amps Food processor	 6 amps Electric coffee pot	 9 amps Crockpot	1.5 amps Toaster	10 amps Heating pad	 .5 amps Hair dryer	10 amps 1100 watt heater	10 amps Television	  2 amps"
232150,holdfast,2008-07-24 12:45:00,1813,"Sorry to hijack the thread, but would it work for a typical sump pump in case of a power failure"
232161,Terry,2008-07-24 13:15:00,14456,"I don't know what typical is but if it's a 1/4 hp motor on it  then about 6.5 amps.......I  take it, the pump would not be running all the time, then yes it would work..during start up it might be a little problem, motors draw the most amps as the start............but it should work"
232182,Fisherman,2008-07-24 14:02:00,7201,"You try and run one of those noisy things remotely close to anyone else and you will end up with a splitting headache...someone will apply a hatchet to your head.  Now if you're 500 feet from the next camper or out in the toolies by yourself, only you will have to put up with the noise.  They make ""dirty"" power, not something you can use to run microwaves, small TV's etc, way too much power fluctuation."
232194,Whopper,2008-07-24 14:21:00,2174,"Terry is bang on with his electrical calcs, how did you get to be such a fart smeller Terry and to think you were just another pretty face  I go camping to get away from electric"
232225,John,2008-07-24 15:42:00,2956, Something to do with the shape of his nose Phil.....
232245,Wild,2008-07-24 16:50:00,704,Forget the smog generator and pick up the inverter or two on sale along with a deep cycle battery.
