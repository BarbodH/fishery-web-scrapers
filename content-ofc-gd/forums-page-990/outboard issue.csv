231549,rpsmith,2008-07-23 11:29:00,28,Currently having a problem with my yamaha 30hp at slow speeds. I have to choke it to keep it running-----runs great as soon as I give it some gas. The gas line has some small cracks and the gas bulge is unusually easy to squeeze. Fuel filter is clean. Should I replace gas line? Maybe a dirty carb? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated...  thanks

Take the carb(s) off, dissemble and clean them.  If the fuel line was the problem, then sure as flypoop in pepper, it definitely wouldn't run then either."
