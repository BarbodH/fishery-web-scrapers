The floor and seats on his seem a little rough but are manageable and that boat has a TON of potential.  I have been pondering this for a while now but not sure who even does it.  Rhino Lining for the floor, seats and walls of my boat.  Has anyone done this? Know how much it costs? Where in Southern ON to get it done?  What do you think? I dont want to do carpet or Vinyl as my aluminums take a beating constantly and the carpet/vinyl will be shot sooner then later."
232002,Cudz,2008-07-24 02:15:00,2652,I have heard of this being done and looked into it.  It adds a fair bit of weight to the boat and you can get do it yourself kits at Canadian tire for about $170 (I think)
