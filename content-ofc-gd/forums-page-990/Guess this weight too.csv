232061,Cudz,2008-07-24 03:09:00,2652,"Ok I don't want to be consedered a liar and by no means am I.  I can see where my other thread is heading with the guess the weight of my friend's LM.  So I started this one to somehow show that I am not BSing.  I know the weight of this fish.  take a guess.  This just lets us understand that we are not that good at guessing.  I do realize that pic size, angle of camera, distance from camera can all make guessing difficult but give this a try. "

232071,Rich,2008-07-24 03:21:00,3927,"I'm done guessing. Once again, the ""raised over the head"" angle is another misleading one, a Bob Izumi trick.  It's big."

232079,Cudz,2008-07-24 03:34:00,2652,This fish was caught by Randy Howell on lake Amistad in Texas in April in the Battle on the Border this year.

232123,Victor,2008-07-24 11:32:00,1609,"that's a lunker, the guy can fit his fist into its mouth with room to spare. Nice fish."
232165,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-24 13:24:00,2050,I was going to say 9 lbs.....nice fish
232401,johnnyb,2008-07-24 21:50:00,3413,"No question in that pic you can see it's a BIG bass..you would immediately think in the 8+ range, and no surprise to hear 10, considering how far away the pic is. Too bad the other thread is getting all the action"
232469,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 23:04:00,8163,"Ok... but can y'all guess the weight of this MONSTER?  1 ""Attaboy"" (gratis) to the one that comes the closest!"
232481,Rich,2008-07-24 23:18:00,3927,"Come on GCD everyone knows you're holding it close to the camera so it looks 3"". Looks more like 2 to me.  With it being the size I believe it is, i'd say 12lbs"
232482,jwl,2008-07-24 23:20:00,1056,"I was going to say an easy conservative 8lbs or so, I caught one over 7 last time at my trailer and that one is bigger than the one I got"
232493,Greencoachdog,2008-07-24 23:40:00,8163, How dare you belittle my fish like that!!!... that fish is a good 4 1/2 or 5 inches long!!!  ... 12 lbs is real close though!
232528,BabyHerc,2008-07-25 00:43:00,285,"I just look at the size of the hand in relation to the head of the fish, not the guy holding it.  I guessed this at 11 pounds before reading the actual weight.  It's not hard to guess a bass' weight if you are aware how deceiving angles and backgrounds can be."
232578,Cudz,2008-07-25 02:30:00,2652,"you have small hands, I am going to say 2 pounds 14 ounces"
