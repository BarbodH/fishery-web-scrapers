429011,Slop,2010-02-03 05:41:00,151,"Project Yolk Sack:  Officials and investegators recently uncovered a major hatchery lab, thanks to some savvy detective work done by agents in the field.    Pretty innocent looking setting until having to penetrate the first of many buildings in the raid.    Once inside the TEAM found the source!!    Brown Trout and lots of them. Those trays above are this falls crop that almost made their way into wading anglers nets.  These guys were scheduled to hit the market in May....about 40,000 or so Browns in 2 tanks.    This was a very sophisticated operation producing various strains of Lake Trout, Speckled Trout, Rainbow Trout and brood stock Walleye.....yes i said Walleye!!     There were thirty holding tanks alone in the one building. Each tank contains roughly 20,000 fish and to ensure high quality yeild, each tank receives 15,000 litres of lake water per hour at approximately 2 degrees above zero.  These tanks hold adult Bay of Quinte Walleye breeding stock, stricktly for the the purpose of the recreational user.    The young seedlings are fed again, through a sophistcated computerized  rail system. Skid loads of vital vittles are housed before they are needed.    The food is manually put into large hoppers.    The seemingly endless supply of food then ends up into a dispsensary system that covers 30 tanks(15 per tier) 40 times daily.    Here are some Lake Nipigon strain Specks that are destined for public access lakes by truck and helicopter.     There were also Whitefish that are a natural strain from Lake Simcoe. Most will end up back in Simcoe and some will go to smaller lakes to hopefully establish a sport fishery.  Here is yet another tray of hatched fish. These lakers will supplement the Lake Ontario fishery. I can't quite remember the strain and origin but was fascinated by them swimming  clockwise.    And this is the result from over a year ago, just a handful of the 100,000 that will be transplanted this spring into Lake ontario.    We never made it to the Splake building as investigators are just uncovering what could be the largest find of back-cross stash in history....and for that reason, due to the fragile nature of the investigation I find it premature and speculative in nature to comment at the present time.  Your fishing licence dollars at work!  Thanks Jim!!!!"

429018,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-03 06:13:00,158,So nice to see. We used to have a lot more of these facilities around.  Gotta love the cutbacks..  The harris government really screwed the MNR.  Which one is this?  White Lake?

429109,gogu392,2010-02-03 16:19:00,142,As I said many time the Fishing licence is the only fee/tax that I am happily paying. Allways 3 years in advance. I hope Ontario fisheries will be abundand in the future.
