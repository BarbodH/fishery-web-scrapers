428762,Headhunter,2010-02-02 18:57:00,5703,"Well Lloyd, firstly, I feel for yah buddy! Loosing that stuff, which you've grown so accustomed to must be a real disappointment. That being said, I'm sure you could use one of Terry's rods as we all know he'll have no real use for more than one. Heck, he could leave tham all at home and still have the same level of success as previous years! HH"
428771,Terry,2010-02-02 19:33:00,14456,dang that's mean to say Joe. a tear comes to my eye  sigh..  LOL as it turns out I can't catch fish when Lloyd is  around  unless it's specks
428780,Headhunter,2010-02-02 20:00:00,5703,"Well Terry, consider yourself way ahead of me because I can't even catch those little spotted carp either! LOL Lloyd, I've put the word out for yah, I truly hope there is at least one honest person out there that gets reached by us and that you get your stuff back. HH"
428838,fishhunter,2010-02-02 21:47:00,604,"Thanks bud!! Now as for Terry's rods, Im not touching any of them!!!!!! They have Joe written all over them lol Its to bad you cant make the trip north with us in a couple weeks. I will have no one to drink drops with lol"
428841,fishhunter,2010-02-02 21:49:00,604,"Thats not true, I seen you catch a fish once on Browns Lake lol"
429279,rtrudeau,2010-02-04 02:09:00,57,"Lloyd, found this ad on Kijiji in Barrie yesterday and thought it may be what you were after.
