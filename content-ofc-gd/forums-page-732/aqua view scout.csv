I hooked it up to a fresh battery and it did the same thing..  So I decided to charge it fully and see wahat happens next  any insight would be appreciated  Thanks in advance  dave"

428978,DMASSE,2010-02-03 03:16:00,420,"problem is the contrast is not working,  I find if you push the knob in it works but you cant fish and push at the same time  going back to CRAPPY TIRE tomorrow  dave"
