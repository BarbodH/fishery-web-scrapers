428609,richyb,2010-02-02 03:24:00,774,So a simcoe pressure crack dented the rear rim on my quad. Only dented on the one side but it was enough to flatten the tire. Should I be able to just gently hammer it back into place?
428623,redneck666,2010-02-02 03:42:00,563,there is a possiblity you could do that and put some rubber bead sealer on there. but i wouldnt trust that. i would recommend a whole new rim all together. but maybe someone else has a better more cost efficient idea than a new rim or more reliable than a hammer and bead sealer haha.
428660,Greg14,2010-02-02 12:20:00,12,you could try hammering it back out..we have fixed a few this wat..use a ball pien hammer....dont wail on it but just keep working it....is it aluminum or steel? we have fixed both this way and also some aluminum racecar wheels
428678,Uncle Buck,2010-02-02 13:24:00,1000,"go to a place that sells car rims, they should be able to get it fixed for you...  you aren't the first guy that's ever smashed a rim...  you could also try a fabrication shop..."
428684,Fisherman,2010-02-02 14:05:00,7201,"So you must have had a real fight with that pressure crack, it must have pounced all over you and the quad, finally it gave up and only got to dent your rim     Or maybe it should go like, I was buzzin along and all of a sudden I hit this pressure crack that I was unable to avoid due to (you fill in the blank) and now I have a damaged rim."
428691,Bernie,2010-02-02 14:26:00,3190,If its a steel rim and it hasn't bent the position of the inside flange it might be OK to straighten it. If it's an aluminum it may break when trying to bend it back depending on the severity of the bend.
428782,richyb,2010-02-02 20:01:00,774,"  Nope it was definitly the cracks fault. haha just kidding. It was actually about the smoothest crossing I have made this year, hardly even a bump. Im going to go out and try pounding it back ( gently)."
428993,ohhenrygsr,2010-02-03 03:52:00,947,Hey Richyb looks like you live in orillia. Take it to the Wheel Shop behind Brafasco
428994,richyb,2010-02-03 03:57:00,774,I took a hammer to it earlier tonight and got it looking decent. Blew the tire up and its holding air for now.  I put a couple extra psi in all the tires so I dont squish the tire down to the rim anymore ( I hope).
428996,redneck666,2010-02-03 04:01:00,563,what you shoulda done first was pick up a bit of bead sealer to make sure you have a good bead that you can half rely on haha.  but as long as the bead holds you should be good till another pressure crack gits' ya haha.
