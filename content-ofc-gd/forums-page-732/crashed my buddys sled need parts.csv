429134,carll2,2010-02-03 18:08:00,443,check out totally yamaha on the 2 stroke forum...they always got great used parts and advice to give on yammies
429140,JohnF,2010-02-03 18:31:00,3494, Most of us see a difference between 230 on a sled and 230 in a car. Or at least I sure do. In fact I've never done 230 on a sled. The antiques I used to ride in the 70's wouldn't go that fast. The most exciting ride I had was when the track disintegrated under a modified 440 F/A that was turning up around 100 mph (we think). In any case speed on a sled is different than speed in a car to me. Of course today's sleds are a lot better sprung.  JF
429148,I'mHooked,2010-02-03 18:56:00,525,"So if it was your buddy's intention to do as you described and just drive the heck out of it for a weekend, it would probably stand to reason that he could have been just as likely to have been the one to give'er and done the unexpected acrobatics?  Really, I'd say he should be saying thank you for being the one to bear the brunt of the experience, and PAYING YOU for having done the ""test ride"" and subsequently saving his hide from possibly a worse fate.  If it wasn't you, it was likely going to happen to the next person riding it anyhow!"
428882,Jeff Wiles,2010-02-02 23:50:00,55,"So my buddy bought a sled nice looking sled 4500 ks on it looks like it sat out side for some time. After I look it over.Its my turn to take it for a ""rip"" up the Welland canal I go as fast as the 1120cc motor will take me last glance was 180kh. Got off the gas and all hell broke loose.The belt snapped jamed in the clutch and locked up the track.After it rolled over and over I put the spare belt on and limped her back. I told my self I will by his half and make her look like she just came out of the show room for letting me walk away not even sore.  I need any thing you have sled is a 97 Yamaha 4 max 750. Its sleeved to 1120.The guy it came from it will do 230kh."

428897,Joey,2010-02-03 00:20:00,9122,"Ouch, that sucks.  Can't help but glad you are okay, and if your buddy didn't kill you, he's a good friend"
428900,irishfield,2010-02-03 00:23:00,26272,Got any pictures??
428902,vinnimon,2010-02-03 00:27:00,2593,I beleive there is someone in dunville that deals with used machines and parts.Not sure about the name of the place.
428903,redneck666,2010-02-03 00:28:00,563, we wanna see some carnage!
428904,Roy,2010-02-03 00:29:00,13728,"On the Welland Canal...you glanced and you were at 180K. You're lucky to be alive, Jeff. If I was your buddy, you'd still be paying for the damage but I'd be looking for someone a little less irresponsible to be repairing it. Sorry dude, it's how I feel."
428905,redneck666,2010-02-03 00:29:00,563,oh by the way if this helps there is a snowmobile junk yard in michigan somewhere!
428910,Sandbag,2010-02-03 00:36:00,533,Lanes is the name of the place in Dunnville for used parts.  Kijiji is also a great place for used parts etc.  Parts for that machine will be fairly hard to come by.  They were not made for that many years.  Good Luck with your search   Cheers  Craig
428920,Jeff Wiles,2010-02-03 00:45:00,55, We paid $900 for it with the plans of riding the crap out of it for the weekend and a that was it if it made it right on if not we had fun. Now I will fix it and he will still ride it ever chance he can.  Jeff
428922,Jeff Wiles,2010-02-03 00:50:00,55,  Do you have his phone number? All I need now is a hood.  Jeff  Its not as bad as you would think we rode it for the rest of the day till the chain case let go on jamie. I don't now how to post pic's
428923,Roy,2010-02-03 00:52:00,13728,"Well that sounds better. I guess the word ""irresponsible"" just slipped out. I probably meant ""maniacal""."
428938,Hellfish,2010-02-03 01:25:00,308,"Hey Jeff we used the guy in dunnville to get the hood for the 800 triple, he foubd one no prob. Ill ask for the number"
428939,Gerritt,2010-02-03 01:27:00,6129,I know there is a place on Hwy 6 north.. Just before the auto clinic (NAPA) repair shop in waterdown... they should be more then able to satisfy you're needs.   G.
428951,Jeff Wiles,2010-02-03 02:02:00,55,  If we ever get some more snow this will be a killer sled for the river.We can go for a slower ride  jeff
428960,Guest steel'n'esox,2010-02-03 02:10:00,0,"  Christ man for 900.00 you could have road the crap out of someone in fishnet stockings and leather stilletos, just be carefull some of those foolya and have trunks"
428963,Ron,2010-02-03 02:20:00,1683," NOw that right there is funny, I don't care who you are! LMAO  Thanks for the chuckle Steve!"
428964,irishfield,2010-02-03 02:24:00,26272,
428969,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-03 02:54:00,4399,I can`t understand why anybody needs to go 180-230 KMH in any vehicle let alone a sled.  Your luck you family is not arranging your funeral!
428976,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-03 03:10:00,158,"  We were all youngins' at some point, some of us outgrow it.  Not all of us can afford to go to the track.  Speed kills for sure, but to soeme the rush is instantly an addiction.  Honestly 230 is nothing though.  Think about supercars and superbikes... Well in excess of 300 km/h.  At least they had the though to do it somewhere where wiping out wouldn't injur or kill anyone else"
428982,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-03 03:31:00,4399," Obviously I wasn`t talking about professionals on a closed course driving properly prepared machines.  I think the poster said the machine looked neglected sitting outside for sometime,kinda silly to take a machine in questionable condition and push it hard. Like I said the young man is lucky he is not chillin on a slab."
428989,redneck666,2010-02-03 03:45:00,563,my 377 goes around 85-90km/h.  oversize bore and just the right settings.
429020,mtpockets2,2010-02-03 09:35:00,12,There's a place in Brantford called Kelloways. He's got all kinda parts for all sleds. Search the name on kijiji and you mcan get his number.
429116,Jeff Wiles,2010-02-03 16:54:00,55,  It is a rush!!!!!!! I drive tow truck so I drive the speed limit all day with all the bad drivers out there. My buddy is digging the tunnel under Niagara Falls.In the winter its Ice bikes-sleds summer musky fishing and dirt bikein.  Jeff The fastes I was on 2 wheels was 279Kh
429122,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-03 17:17:00,4399, Well now it all makes perfect sense!LOL  Keep the shinny side up.
