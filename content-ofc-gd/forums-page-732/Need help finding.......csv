New or used doesn't matter as long as it works.  Any help is much appreciated  Thanks, Ryan  p.s. will this unit work with out it if i can't get one??"
428974,irishfield,2010-02-03 03:03:00,26272,You can use the transom mount transducer just fine Ryan... reverse the bracket on it to get the cord tiewrapped centred and use a piece of pipe wrap foam about 8 inches long and just wrap the cord around it once to make it easily adjustable.  I couldn't find an ice transducer anywhere last year when I wanted one.. ended up ordering off ebay as Lowrances on-line will only let you order if you're in the USA.
428995,camillj,2010-02-03 04:01:00,1988,I use my regular transducer on a portable mount (which I bought from BP for about $30) it's then simply clamped onto a piece of hockey stick across the hole .. works like a charm and I can extend it well below ice level... the whole thing goes flat and I can wrap the cord up for easy transportation and storage
