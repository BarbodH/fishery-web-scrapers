428417,aplumma,2010-02-01 20:16:00,6896,  I was right with you till the Testes thing.     Art
428556,Radnine,2010-02-02 01:52:00,1538,"Okay Bill, I googled your razer so I now know what you are talking about but I am not sure why. What made you want to try this razor? I do the soap/brush thing so I get that (even though its a pain at times to find shaving soap) but am unclear as to why you would go retro on the blade? Please clarify. Jim"
428562,BillM,2010-02-02 02:04:00,17367," Hey Jim,  I find I get a way better shave with a lot less irritation with a DE compared to a disposable.   I can actually shave upwards on my neck with my DE and not end up with a burning face after it's all said and done.   It also doesn't get clogged up like my Mach3 used to...  I can make one pass, regardless of how long I've left my beard and it will be as smooth as a babies ass.  I'd need 2 or 3 passes with a Mach 3 to get the same result..  Also the blades on the Mach 3 tend to pull then cut your facial hair, this is how you end up with irritation..   I did some research and decided to give it a try..  Sure the prep takes longer, but for me it's an enjoyable 5-10mins or so..."
428579,douG,2010-02-02 02:35:00,2693,"That's interesting stuff, something I don't pay much attention to.  I'm still a Tracll Plus kinda guy, Edge gel, for about 35 years.  The idea of dropping a cnote on a razor and badger brush, is a luxury that I should get around to soon.  Decadent.  So is the"
428584,BillM,2010-02-02 02:46:00,17367,"Doug, give it a shot... I am willing to bet you'll never shave with a disposable again."
428589,blarg,2010-02-02 02:59:00,289,"I made the switch to the DE razor last year, it is a much better shave-if you do it right, and it's much cheaper than buying those mach 3 4 5 7 10.. etc blades, it isn't a step backward."
428590,douG,2010-02-02 03:00:00,2693,"BillM, have you found this msg board?  The Wet Shave answer to Rule 34.  NOT WHAT YOU THINK, /b/ doods.  SFW honest."
428597,redneck666,2010-02-02 03:12:00,563," i just got some phillip's electric deal, i don't necessarily ""shave"" but i ""trim"" lol. im too lazy to make it close. lol i just use the ""beard trimmer"" deal on the razor."
428607,BillM,2010-02-02 03:23:00,17367," Doug, I picked up a great sampler pack from a vendor on that site"
428613,douG,2010-02-02 03:28:00,2693,Still in front I see.  A tip I heard once from a theater type guy was to first lay down a thin layer of olive or mineral oil first before the lather for a very close shave.  Like a baby's bottom.  And stop slapping me already.
428632,fish_fishburn,2010-02-02 04:20:00,1311,The lid off a soup can works good.haha
428654,Radnine,2010-02-02 11:59:00,1538,I hate it when you guys do this to me. I'm actually looking into this now Jim
428692,irishfield,2010-02-02 14:27:00,26272, Well I don't have a soup can lid Jim... but I still have the ravioli lid from Sunday's ice fishing.. will that do??? Has a nice little pull tab to use as a grip spot!
428696,BillM,2010-02-02 14:32:00,17367, Very good tip.  I just picked up a tub of Proraso eucalyptus oil that goes on pre-soap and post shave if needed.  I'll give it a shot today and let you know how it works out
428710,Spiel,2010-02-02 15:42:00,9065,Shaving is so over rated. I got it down to 3 times a month some 30 years ago and that's enough for me.
428742,jace,2010-02-02 17:46:00,472," the best stuff i ever had was something by gillette.  I forget what it was called but it came in a bottle shaped like deodorant and you squirt it out of a pinhole in the top.   non aerosol.   A small drop is all you would need stuff smeared on super slick when it got wet, almost like the white strip stuff only not as gooey.   The last 2 bottles i bought were on a clearance table for a quarter each and they lasted several years each.   I suspect that's why they pulled it from the market.   I would pay $30 for another bottle if i could find one, at this point, the only place you might find it is at a cornerstore on a lonesome road.   ...this product left the market maybe 15 years ago.   forgot to say this stuff didnt' foam.  It was blue but went on pretty clear."
428797,Jonny,2010-02-02 20:40:00,1380,"Shaving is a chore, not a pleasure. Now that I'm retired, I shave about every second day, unless I'm going somewhere.  Splash with hot water, lather with liquid soap, shave with 5-pak triple-blade swiveling disposables from Dollarama (made in Israel or India, I think). Good razors, and $1 does me for about a month.  The money I save can buy me some extra rye whisky every once in a while."
428812,Governator,2010-02-02 21:11:00,879,I use to use electric until the battery completely went on my last one.  Instead of replacing wife picked me up Fusion.  Haven't even thought about going back to electric.  I can finally get my neck hair.  Tip: only buy the replacement blades when they are on sale.
428843,goteeboy,2010-02-02 21:55:00,175,"i started using DE razors about three years ago. I now have a Merkur Futur and another merkur, the name i forget and an older Gillette DE razor. The Futur is my fave. Also have one badger and one boar brush and i use Williams shave soap supplemented w/ Nivea or Proraso cream.  I think DE razors are making a comeback. Watch mantic59 on youtube for tips. He's the shaving god of youtube."
428176,BillM,2010-02-01 02:34:00,17367,"I've recently purchased my first DE razor(Merkur 38HD long shaft) and I can tell you there is no way that a Fusion, Mach3 or any other similar torture device will ever touch my face again...  Got a big sampler pack of blades, currently using a Derby with great results..  Combine that with a good badger brush, some Proraso soap and I look forward to shaving everyday (ok, maybe every other day, lol)"
428202,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-01 03:34:00,10439,I shave dry with a Bowie knife. Fancy shavers are for Nancy Boys!!!!!!
428203,irishfield,2010-02-01 03:34:00,26272,Glad someone said it...
428204,Bernie,2010-02-01 03:37:00,3190,You guys are wussies.  
428205,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-01 03:38:00,0,I shave with a mach 3 when the need arises but for the most part i use the electric. Most of the time I just have a small beard because I don't like shaving!
428207,kickingfrog,2010-02-01 03:43:00,8333,"Just so we're all on the same page, a DE razor is a step or 2 removed from a strait razor, and has been around longer then most of us."
428208,BillM,2010-02-01 03:43:00,17367, Show us your straight edge Dave!!   lol   Or do you use those pink disposables?  :
428209,Leecher,2010-02-01 03:46:00,7832,Been over 20 years that I used such device.... don't really need to   trim.....maybe but that's it
428210,backbay,2010-02-01 03:47:00,773,"The kind Dad used to use! I started with one, but am happy to use the Mach 3 now. Am I missing something?"
428217,BillM,2010-02-01 03:58:00,17367," Yeah, I don't think I'm ready to take the plunge on a straight razor yet, lol..."
428219,SBCregal,2010-02-01 04:05:00,688,what's shaving?
428226,pike slayer,2010-02-01 04:25:00,1177,what part of the body you taking about shaving?
428239,jace,2010-02-01 05:31:00,472,"  I have a small collection of old razors from the 50's and 60's that i snatched from my father and grandfather.   There was a time i used them every day but then i switched back to the Atra.   The double edge blades were $5/10-pack not that long ago, then in the high tech razor blitz that happened a few years ago (starting with the Sensor), the DE blades somehow also got raised up to $12-15 and some are sold in 5 packs.   I've seen inexpensive 100packs of blades on Amazon but there are too many counterfeits online for me to bother with them.   And the other reason is i got lazy.  It's nice having a blade head that moves to the face instead of having to move my hand to change the blade angle.  I still have the brush, soap and razors out, i just don't use them as often."

428270,bubbles,2010-02-01 12:45:00,591,Strait Razors cut my ass every time!
428276,BITEME,2010-02-01 12:58:00,1968,Used a straight razor for awhile when I was in the forces got it from my Grandfather really nice German steel bone handle with a glass hone anyway someone stole it when we were across the pond. so I have been using disposables. Still use the later pot and a deer hair brush. But it is funny you mention this because I had a real nice straight razor in my hand yesterday that I think Im going to go back and buy. Takes a little fineese but I still think it is the best shave  Peter
428280,bigugli,2010-02-01 13:11:00,6138,"The only time I get near a razor is in the barber's chair to trim up the ""nest"" for summer."

428297,Spiel,2010-02-01 13:52:00,9065, Okay Fred.
428304,Fisherman,2010-02-01 14:01:00,7201,"Wussies, Bic lighter and some kerosene for aftershave."
428308,Headhunter,2010-02-01 14:10:00,5703,"Half and half Williams! I prefer the brass side, keeps it's edge better... watch out for the side wash hooks! When the Williams isn't handy, I use what ever is on sale! HH"
428319,bigbuck,2010-02-01 14:38:00,2449,"Hiya Flintstone!! I used the my dad's old DE a few years back and it was the closest shave. Problem is though I have a very coarse beard combinded with sensitive skin so a real close shave lights my face up like a Christmas tree. I'm one of those guys who goes to work in the morning clean shaven and needs to shave again at night to go out. I use whatever razors I find on special and I use the same disposable for about 6 weeks or so. My little trick that I use is my shaving cream dispenser that heats the shaving cream that way, right after my shower, my pores and skin are loosened up and don't get tightened by using cold shaving cream."
428334,Moosebunk,2010-02-01 15:43:00,3970,"Shave with whatever she brings home for me to shave with Bill.  Not fussy on razors... as long as their not rusted or haven't seen a pair of legs or testes, I'm good to use it."
428349,Uncle Buck,2010-02-01 16:35:00,1000,"I use the sideburn trimmer on the electric to get rid of the long stuff, then finish with a fusion no pre shave, shaving cream, aftershave, balms or anything... on the dry like a  man....  Wanted to get the straight blade, every store i went to advised against it... says it's very tricky and dangerous...  I changed my mind, i'm rather attached to my head, don't need to slice it off witht the striaght blade"
428352,SlowPoke,2010-02-01 16:49:00,2984,I trim the course stuff down with knipex pliers and finish up with the epilady.
