427931,muskymatt,2010-01-31 18:29:00,2608,Actually I think the Laffs are doing just fine this season..........  Up 3-0 and lose 5-3.......classics leafs hockey if you   ask me!!!!
427946,uglyfish,2010-01-31 18:57:00,981,"  have fun with that. i still cant see how he is the number one pick! aside from patrice cormier, hall was the worst player canada had on the ice at he juniors this year. very weak on his feet, always gets knocked off the puck and knocked down. was always tryin to beat everyone of the ice instead of passing the puck. and he gave the puck up 95% of the time he tried to beat everyone."
428052,irishfield,2010-01-31 22:38:00,26272," Yah that was pretty funny.. especially near the end when he was skating around talking to all the ""fans"" ! lol"
428090,jediangler,2010-01-31 23:40:00,1923,"At least with Elisha Cuthbert being traded to the leafs today, leaf fans will have something pleasant to look at when they go to the ACC. Thanks again for the 2 firsts and a second rounder for Kessel, Mr. Burke. Word is that the ""Monster"" is regretting signing with the Leafs instead of the Dallas Stars and plans to try his luck with another team after July 1st rather than re-sign with toronto."

414451,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 14:40:00,0,"he didn't leap as part of the hit, he leapt as he completed the hit on the follow through... apparently the nhl (as well as anyone who isn't a leaf fan) does not feel it was dirty, just a big hit at a vulnerable time. we could argue about it until we're all blue in the face but the league through it's inaction has demonstrated that the hit was legal. i'm sure orr or komi has his number..."
414481,JohnF,2009-12-22 15:18:00,3494," Stajan kinda defended the hit last night in an interview. He admitted he had his head down, sort of a mea culpa.  Part of the problem is that the size of the players is growing every year. They're starting to look more like husky basketball teams than hockey teams, and unfortunately some of the niftiest players are still little 6' pipsqueaks and unless they start jumping (and get charging penalties) their little heads are gonna be right about shoulder/elbow level for the Charas of the hockey world.  Dunno what the solution is to that fact of hockey life. Guys taking mid-ice passes have to learn to trust the passing ability of their team mates and just keep their stick on the ice and have soft hands. If they look for the puck they're gonna get smoked.  All that being said I really relish those moments when one of the ginormous players gets his bell rung by one of the little squirts, not that it happens often. Chara may well be a gentle giant but I get sick of seeing him ""gently"" take guys off the puck with an elbow in the ear. All I want for Christmas is to see him get some of that back in spades from someone. anyone. Same goes for Chris Pronger, except in his case I wouldn't mind seeing someone mebbe take a few extra minutes penalty. He's a dirty checker who knows exactly where his elbows are gonna make contact. As tough as it is for the league to qualify headshots, I wish they could find a way to give the refs some leeway in interpreting what was intent to injure and what was just collateral damage.  JF"
414486,bigfish1965,2009-12-22 15:28:00,3382,"Ok..leafs suck. It was a clean hit. Having your head down and leaning back like that sets you up for a head shot. You have lowered your head far too much by your body angle. NEVER cut across the ice like that near the blue line or you will get your head removed...it has always been that way. Something they teach you in bantam hockey. Head up, don't admire your pass, don't look in your feet for a pass, don't cut across the blue line! The hitter got less resistance than he expected so the lifting force ends up in taking your feet off the ice."

415753,JohnF,2009-12-27 19:07:00,3494," Lotsa mediocre going around the NHL these days. Too many teams whose records by your standard would seem to indicate they're pretty hot are having to struggle to beat the Leafs. Way too many ties and strong comebacks by the Leafs for many of the other teams to get too cocky.  Besides, we've got the Juniors to cheer for for a few days. I wish they hadn't had such an easy time against the Latvians. The Americans had to work hard for a good part of their game against the Czechs. It was a good pace setter. Brutal checking game but hopefully the one Latvian won't be out of the whole show. That would suck for him. Be fun to see the kids whose NHL team can't spare them (which in itself says a lot about the calibre of the NHL today) playing with the Canucks. Our juniors may not even need those pros but it would be fun to see what they'd be like with them.  Go Canucks.  JF"

413843,JohnF,2009-12-20 14:40:00,3494, Dunno what more you could have asked from Gustafson last night. He didn't get that shutout because his dmen were all stellar.  How does one tell which are the number one goalies? Seems to me they all have their ups and downs. Boston's sitting the Vezina winner right now. Brodeur sucked in the much touted battle of the goalies for the number one start spot on the Canadian team a while back. Ottawa gets a near shutout from a first gamer last night. Luongo's had some problems but he may be the closest thing to a solid number one at the moment. As I look around the league there are a lot of backups playing pretty regularly. Perhaps even the coaching staffs aren't sure what to expect from a number one any more?  JF
413920,misfish,2009-12-20 18:37:00,29133,"  I was talking about the 2 goalies.  One of them need to step up and be the #1. The leafs have always had a #1,even though they would never be on anyother team.LOL   Im always MIS-understood here.LOL"

Gustavsson will not be there number 1 ... I think he is just a temporary solution until they can unload Toskala and go shopping again  here are those stas if you care to look:  http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8475361"

414361,muskymike,2009-12-22 02:46:00,772," I am a Leafs fan 100% but he didn't leap. The direction the league is going now, any open ice hit can be misconstrued as a dirty hit.  It wasn't a blatant head shot, and anyone who has played hockey at the Junior Level and above would hopefully agree with that. From PeeWee on, you are taught to keep your head up and not to accept a pass such as that.  Stajan was hit cleanly. The way things are going, the NHL will soon be ""non-contact"". It's sad, it's part of the game, when someone gets hit, let it be a lesson, not a debate.  And.....I'm done"
