429192,splitshot,2010-02-03 23:00:00,6,"Just wondering if anybody has been fishing around Trenton? If so, kind of luck. Have fished all over the bay over the years but, this is the closest point from Peterborough. Ice conditions also as I have not been there this year."
429221,Roy,2010-02-04 00:04:00,13728,"Welcome aboard, Splitshot. Sorry I can't help you with that area as I only fish Quinte once a year usually in November and even then it's in the Picton area. I'm sure though that one of the guides like G2 or the Quinte team will take a minute to help you out...right guys?  Consider this a bump."
429235,splitshot,2010-02-04 00:29:00,6,"Thanks Roy! I have fished the Picton area with good success. About 400yrds from where the Glenora ferry crosses. I will travel the distance, but it does add quite a bit more time."
429249,Stoty,2010-02-04 00:50:00,2910,"Hey Splitshot,  PM me if you want more details."
429255,Grimace,2010-02-04 01:02:00,2020,"I can't help you out, I have not fished Quinte this year through the ice so I have no info for you.  I think maybe Roy meant by saying ""I'm sure though that one of the guides like G2 or the Quinte team will take a minute to help you out...right guys?""  was that maybe one of the area guides could take a minute to help you out.  Not offer there services to you at a price to take you out.  Sorry if I am off side.  Anyways, I hope somebody gives you info man.   Good luck on Quinte."
429257,Roy,2010-02-04 01:05:00,13728,"  you're not off side at all, Grimace, that's ed zachary what I meant. Nice catch."
