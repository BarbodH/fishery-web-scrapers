429184,splitshot,2010-02-03 22:24:00,6,Try putting MNR stocking lists 2008-2009. Should then give you a Pdf to open. I've used it quite a few times this year with no problem.
429187,basketclam,2010-02-03 22:34:00,115,I've found that contacting the local MNR bio directly can lead you to a real wealth of information.  Ask nicely and you might be amazed what information is out there!
429210,trevy727,2010-02-03 23:33:00,351,"  i phoned about 5 offices last year and left messages asking them to send me stocking lists by e-mail and sure enough, a day or 2 later they were in my in-box."
