427212,gil,2010-01-29 14:29:00,41,"Aaron,  You tipping the lil foxxe or fishin it clean? Can you give us a tip on technique? I've got a bunch of those for perch (glow ,silver gold)but havn't had much luck! Probably wrong technique! Thanx Gil"
427236,Aaron Shirley,2010-01-29 15:14:00,655,"Hi Gil, Funny you ask that, as I haven't tipped the Foxee jig before this trip.  I cut off the tail of a shiner and tipped the Foxee jig.  It works well run clean most times, but since the fish were in a negative mood where we fished, I tried tipping it and it worked.  I work the bait by banging it off bottom a few times to stir up the silt, then hang it just off bottom.  When I see a fish on sonar looking at the lure, I reel the bait up quickly about a foot or more and pause it.  If the fish doesn't hit at this point, I work the fish according to the action of the fish on sonar.  Most times on most days I will see a lot of fish refuse before a fish commits.  Electronics are essential for my success most days unless they are hitting well on tip-ups.  Hope this helps!  Aaron"
429282,Lunkerhunter,2010-02-04 02:13:00,455,good report aaron.. how do you normally rig your tip up??
429359,Aaron Shirley,2010-02-04 03:45:00,655,"Don McCaw shows me this hockey stick rattle reel tip-up years ago, and it has been great.  It is a dowel inserted into a door-stopper spring with a loop on the end. An egg sinker or slip weight with a split shot 12"" up the line to a gammy octopus hook is the rig.  Shiner hooked through the bottom near the anal fin and placed on bottom with a tight line. That's it, pretty simple but effective.  Aaron"
426413,Aaron Shirley,2010-01-27 20:33:00,655,"I fished with Tony on Simcoe on Sunday, and it was pretty slow for the most part. We tried off Inissfil in the morning, but after Tony lost one and nothing else all morning, we switched spots at noon and finally hit paydirt.  Overall tough, but we salvaged the day with the move. We needed electronics to help trigger these inactive fish. We worked hard for our bites ont he sonar, and most fish wouldn't move up more than a foot other than my last suicidal whitie up 10' to smash the Little Foxee Jig.  Tony got into the first couple of fish, both lakers with one good one. One on a tip-up and shiner, the other on a Jigging Rap.                Then I took some hits, on a great set-up, with a hook and shiner drop-shot style and a Jigging Rap and Blue Fox Little Foxee jig as a weight, and both bait and lure worked. We both lost a few fish which sucked on such a slow day... but that's fishin'.  Sorry about the black box.. it is covering a new prototype reel I cannot show yet          Good fishing!  Aaron"
426420,anders,2010-01-27 20:57:00,1168,"A fishing report!!!  Nice job guys...interesting set up, with the drop shot technique...i should try that one day soon!"

426604,Aaron Shirley,2010-01-28 04:16:00,655,"The sonar I use (until I sell it) is the Humminbird I have for sale now in OFC classifieds, 787c2i with ice transducer.  I would say ice was about 8"" minimum on Sunday where we fished.  Good fishing!  Aaron"
426622,redneck666,2010-01-28 05:27:00,563,"great job dude, whats that hangin outta the whitefishes mouth? im only firmiler to a teardrop and wax worms when it comes to fishin for them things."

426718,Spiel,2010-01-28 14:51:00,9065,"Sweet, good job Tony and Aaron.  I have not iced a whitie or laker since you and I were out with Don McCaw Aaron, mind you that was also the last time I went."
426760,Aaron Shirley,2010-01-28 16:54:00,655,"Next time I go Spiel, I'l llet you know.  The more the merrier when ice fishing... although I walk for miles in a day!  I learned a lot of valuable advice and tips from that Simcoe ice God - Don McCaw.  Have you heard from him lately?  Sending you a PM Chuck.  I'll let you know next time I'm heading out.  Bigredneck, that lure is a Blue Fox Little Foxee jig, similar to Meegs, Bad Boyz and Hump Back Creepers, but with a feather tail.  I'll be eating that last one this weekend, mmm mm good!  Aaron"
426763,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-28 17:00:00,2690,"Nice catch, beauty whities and lakers, and, nice to see a fishing report!!!!!!!!!!!"
426778,Aaron Shirley,2010-01-28 17:44:00,655," Thx.  If I didn't just get this new Blackberry, I still wouldn't be able to get on-line much.  I work two full-time jobs and look after a demanding baby when I get home.  Thank god for the berry, now I can get on-line at breaks while at work  Aaron"
426877,Dusky,2010-01-28 21:56:00,310,Beauty fishes! Good going.
427030,Spiel,2010-01-29 01:37:00,9065," That'd be cool Aaron, hopefully I can manage a day or two before the season closes.  Don sure knows his game, anyone new to the game would be wise to spend a day with him. And no I haven't talked to him in some time but I should."
427033,Syn,2010-01-29 01:45:00,519,Awesome report. Loved the picture quality and big fish.
