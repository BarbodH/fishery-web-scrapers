427182,skeeter,2010-01-29 13:24:00,1907,THESE ARE THE RULES :::::::::  if you own a hut 1-do NOT LEAVE ANYTHING in it that is not screwed in..... 2-do NOT LOCK the door.......  two very simple rules.......  if you leave garbage in it they will throw it down your holes. if you lock it they will rip the door off or smash it in....
427187,Roy,2010-01-29 13:34:00,13728,"Sounds like a fun lake to be on, Dann."

427202,Dara,2010-01-29 14:13:00,3052,Some people will also go in and have a crap in the middle of the floor.
427205,Spiel,2010-01-29 14:22:00,9065, That stinks.

427238,Hud,2010-01-29 15:26:00,140,"sorry guys, this is probably a dumb question but is this a specific lake or does this happen everywhere?  I have a hut that I""m hauling out next weekend and am glad I read this when I did"
427239,skeeter,2010-01-29 15:28:00,1907,i've only heard this on lake simcoe
427442,xeon,2010-01-30 02:57:00,350, I'd burn my hut to the ground if it was ever violated like that. You don't know many stories of people doing that out on Haviland Bay do you?
427461,Jonny,2010-01-30 03:53:00,1380,We're using a portable hut for a change this year but for the last 3 years we had a season hut out on Nipissing. Nobody ever touched it.
427647,sandybay,2010-01-30 18:06:00,64, That's because we are are civilized up here.
427875,tjsa,2010-01-31 15:40:00,1578,Recent happenings up here in Thunder Bay on Lac Des Mille Lacs.
428795,Jonny,2010-02-02 20:32:00,1380,In the North Bay Nugget today...   That's only a few miles from where I fish. Would be nice if they could catch the b*stards cause if they don't they'll do it again.
