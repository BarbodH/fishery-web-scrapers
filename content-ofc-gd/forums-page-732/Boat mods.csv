Ideas i'm interested in include:  Repainting the hull Recarpeting the interior Installing a lockable rod bin in the floor Replacing the rotting wood on the bow where my trolling motor is  Google isn't helping me find any shops that do this type of work.  I'd appreciate if anyone could reply here with some leads i can follow.  website links would be great.  Thanks!"
