429000,Sinker,2010-02-03 04:12:00,8692,You got him on the full moon didn't you  Nice work!  I also like to put a spruce branch on top of the snare. Just enough to make the rabbit drop his head to go under........and right into the snare. It also blocks any glare from moonlight.  Keep atter! Many rabbits will run the same trail.  S.
429130,pikeie,2010-02-03 17:58:00,380,"Yep i always have some spruce, ceder or balsam over top of my snare. i also think it might make them feel more comfortable going through it."
429250,trapshooter,2010-02-04 00:52:00,1234,How did it taste Matty?
428756,pikeie,2010-02-02 18:36:00,380,"Well i have had zero luck when it came to snareing snowshoes. but with the help of many members, and through trial and error i finally snared my first hare!  i got to say to was pretty cool to see, i walked up to my first snare and noticed my rope was all over the place and my ""funnel"" was trashed, but as i got closer i realized that white blob of ""snow"" was acctually my first hare!  so i snaped a few quick pics out in the field!      and it worked just as it should of! the snare was right around the neck and it didnt look like it put up to much of a fight.  Thanks agian guys for all the help i recived!"
428758,rob v,2010-02-02 18:41:00,535,Congratulations on your success.  It's always nice to see a plan come together.  While I support hunting and trapping 100% - I would wonder what our tree hugger folks would think of this type of harvest.    Obviously it doesn't look to be the most humane of processes ??
428760,BillM,2010-02-02 18:52:00,17367,"From all the busted branches and crap, I'd say it put up a bit of a struggle.."
428761,pikeie,2010-02-02 18:57:00,380,"ok well BillM, heres how a snare works those busted branches were broke by ME! when u snare rabbits u look for a well used trail and follow it untill u come to a natural funel, like two trees close togeather, then u take a bunch of sticks and branches and jam them into the snow to create an even tighter funel which narrows down to about 4 inches... and this is where you put your snare! its acctually kinda cool how it works. and like i siad before all those broken branches were busted by ME lol."
428765,pikeie,2010-02-02 19:00:00,380,this is how a snare set looks...  the one i got mine in was built way bigger and had alot more branche obviously
428768,BillM,2010-02-02 19:08:00,17367,"Ah, ok that makes a bit more sense.  That first pic kinda looks like a bomb went off, lol"
428770,Terry,2010-02-02 19:21:00,14456,part of a proud Canadian heritage/tradition  nice going
428772,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-02-02 19:35:00,0,well done bud. glad to see your efforts paid off.
428775,TJQ,2010-02-02 19:44:00,7806,I get one or two every year.... the trick to eating them i to let them sit in the fridge for a couple of days... I quarter mine. and marinate in Italian dressing...  Do the quarters right on the grill.  The back is delicious!!  Not a big fan of cleaning them however...   CONGRATS!!
428779,Toronto_Angler,2010-02-02 19:59:00,698,  This is extremely humane compared to factory farming
428791,wallacio,2010-02-02 20:22:00,475,Nice catch!   Please send the hind feet this way if you aren't using them...the hair between the toes is great for my absolute favourite dry fly pattern!  http://www.flyguysoutfitting.com/usual.html
428803,tb4me,2010-02-02 20:52:00,3295,wow thats Awesome! we (my cousin and I ) used to snare them when we were kids..Didnt think ppl did this anymore..Grandma used to love it when we brought her the snoshoes! Congrats on the catch! we used to have a blast doing this sort of thing..Kinda makes me wan tto go out and set a few! Do you need a licence or permit to snare them? Just wan to be sure im not breaking any laws??
428806,highdrifter,2010-02-02 21:00:00,2534,Did she lay some rabbit eggs before she went to heaven???!!!  Nice work bud.  Those hind paws look groteskly huge..  An extra lucky rabbit's foot in there no doubt!  cheers HD  ps.  P3TA now knows your IP!!  j/k
428807,highdrifter,2010-02-02 21:01:00,2534, A small game license outta do ya.
428808,Paully,2010-02-02 21:03:00,712, Here's an easy way to clean a rabbit... is a snow she hare different? 
428810,dave524,2010-02-02 21:05:00,4508,"  Small game licence, if I remember correctly, couldn't find it in the latest regs, you have to be north of the French-Mattawa Rivers to legally snare rabbits  EDIT: after a little further searching   ""Snares cannot be used, except by the holder of a resident's small game license for taking varying hares north of the French and Mattawa Rivers with a snare constructed of copper or brass wire between 22 and 24 gauge.  The opening of the snare wire loop must be 10 cm (4 in.) or less in diameter."""
428819,ChrisK,2010-02-02 21:21:00,2772,Congrads on your first rabbit and may there be many more

428892,Beans,2010-02-03 00:07:00,3339,Way to go Matthew...  A google search should produce lots of recipies...
428893,BUSTER,2010-02-03 00:10:00,1336,"THANK YOU,  its funny i was just about to post ""how do you cook that"""
428896,BillM,2010-02-03 00:18:00,17367," Please send it Daves way, I need more dry flies"
428953,pikeie,2010-02-03 02:04:00,380,Thanks Guys! i just got it skined and cleaned and the hide looks amazing im going to tan it tomarrow i think!
428983,waterwolf,2010-02-03 03:31:00,556,"no snares south of the french river guys, that's the rule. wish that was not the case.  way to go !! cograts all the way!!  great lookin' snare ,,but you might want to put a bit of branch material over the top side of your snare . many a time wary bunnies jump over a set-up that makes them a bit  uncomfortable .  a natural circular entrance thru branches works very well as long as doesn't  seem to constricting .cedars are soft and hide you snare well 'til it's too late .snare on on full moons with calm winds to increase you efforts . bunnies run hard during these conditions."
