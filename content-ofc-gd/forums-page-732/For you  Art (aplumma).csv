429408,Spiel,2010-02-04 12:45:00,9065,"Thanks again for all the kudos guys, much appreciated.    That's not what Mom told me.    I have just the rod Kevin and that might be a good option for getting my first walleye on a fly rod."
427597,Spiel,2010-01-30 16:11:00,9065,  Here you go Art. It's a little bigger than most mosquitoes (except in the north) but it's the smallest hook I had on hand.    
427602,TJQ,2010-01-30 16:25:00,7806,WOW!!  Thats incredible.. who knew you were so good with your hands!!!     and it looks life size to me!!
427605,Beans,2010-01-30 16:35:00,3339,WOW !!! Makes me want to run and get that can of 97 % deet the boys gave us a couple of years ago...  Great work Spiel...
427608,Leecher,2010-01-30 16:40:00,7832,Another beauty Awesome job Chris
427612,irishfield,2010-01-30 16:44:00,26272,There goes Leah swatting my screen again...
427637,Bernie,2010-01-30 17:32:00,3190,This is one after Art gives a donation at Lakair.  
427644,Daplumma,2010-01-30 17:55:00,1961,Looks very real to me.I'd hate to swat that bugger and have that hook bury into my hand. Joe
427653,Dozer,2010-01-30 18:26:00,896,Spectacular!
427657,rbaquial,2010-01-30 18:34:00,968,HOLY SMOKES!! I almost thought that was REAL for a second there!!!  AWESOME WORK!!
427676,John,2010-01-30 19:24:00,2956,Now you are just showing off.................great work Chris!
427679,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-30 19:55:00,2582,Keep em coming. Like to see such nice work. Very envious of people who can do things I would just butcher even to try.  My nephew lives in Elora and has just taken up fly fishing for Browns and really loves it. I know if he was on this site he would be lovin your work as well.
427680,aplumma,2010-01-30 19:57:00,6896,Wow thats a great job Chris. I will accept it as a gift if you deliver it to Lak Air this year.  Actually I will go one better $50.00 has been donated in your name to the Tyler Foundation.   Art
427828,Ron,2010-01-31 10:12:00,1683,Always wanted an excuse to give you a swat! Kewl Chris!
427836,Spiel,2010-01-31 12:05:00,9065,"Thanks everyone.  It's not something I'd ever tie for actual use but since I was sort of challenged by Art I thought what the hell, I'll give it a whirl.    You sir are most generous, very kind of you! I will indeed put it away for the trip to Lakair.    Funny you've never needed an excuse before."
427841,Fish Farmer,2010-01-31 12:38:00,2234,"So...that's what bit me the other day at your house. I thought it was the little brown bottles. YEP,,, sure looks like Sheephead material to me. MAN You got to get out with me, Whitie'in. Chris you got to bring them to the meeting Tues., Show them, work like that shouldn't be stuck in a box."
427842,Paully,2010-01-31 12:42:00,712,Now thats talent!
427855,danbouck,2010-01-31 13:59:00,4380,That is INSANE!!!
427883,tjsa,2010-01-31 15:51:00,1578,Very well done Chris.
427885,danc,2010-01-31 15:54:00,4677,I'm speechless.... Amazing detail.
428114,Spiel,2010-02-01 00:27:00,9065, Bit of both I'm sure Farmer.    Thank you.    That's what I thought when I strarted tying it. Still do!    Thnks Tom.    Good practice Dan for those bigger type flies/jigs.
428689,Spiel,2010-02-02 14:25:00,9065,"Here you go Art, I found some smaller (#28) hooks and made another bout half the size.    Hard to get the finer detail in but I did manage to get the dark back over a white abdomen.    "
428706,dannyboy,2010-02-02 15:21:00,367,"Very nice work Chris, thanks for sharing.  Dan"
428872,Leecher,2010-02-02 23:34:00,7832,Beautiful Chris     Awesome work Thanks for sharing Jacques
429041,aplumma,2010-02-03 13:15:00,6896,your going to go blind if you keep tiein  things that small. I will say though that I thought the thread work on your rods was tedious and very exact but your flies are even more proof of your skills.   Art
429074,capt_hooked,2010-02-03 14:43:00,212,I'm impressed... wel done...Spiel...!  a micro artist.. bet you sweated a little blood making those suckers...!   bring up your extreme ultra-lite fly rod.. and we'll go fishing for walleye fry.. by the moonlight...    the cap't
