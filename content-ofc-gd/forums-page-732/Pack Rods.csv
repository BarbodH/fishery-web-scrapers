This year I want to add a 6'6"" 4 piece medium/light spinning rod to my arsenal for backpacking trips.  Does anybody have any input or suggestions?  Cabelas has a store brand ""Fish Eagle II"" for $90. Does anybody have experiance with Cabelas store brand rods?  There is also the St. Croix Triumph travel rods in the same price range.  Are there any other good models from other manufacturers that you guys have had success with? Anything to avoid?"
429360,EC1,2010-02-04 03:45:00,930,Fenwick Eagle GT in 7' ML 4pc. should be fine too. I've had an Eagle GT in 5'6 UL and don't have any complaints about it.

429363,highdrifter,2010-02-04 03:53:00,2534,I've got a premier PS70MF - 3 piece that always finds it's way into my luggage.  A great all around stick if the winds kick up and it's too tough to fly cast.  Just got back from Belize and it was pretty much the only thing I casted all week.  A little light for cudas and poons but perfect for snook and bones!  It might be more than 90 but worth every penny.  cheers HD

429371,Aaron Shirley,2010-02-04 04:09:00,655,I have the Rapala Magnum pack rod and really like it.  I used it a few times last year and enjoyed it.  They introduced a medium light this year.  Check out the link: Rapala Travel Rods  Aaron
