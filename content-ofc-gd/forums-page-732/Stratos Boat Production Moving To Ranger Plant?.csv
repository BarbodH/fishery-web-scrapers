In fact, I'm told Ranger is completing a feasibility study on this very scenario right now, to figure out the cost savings and ensure it doesn't interfere with Ranger's own production plans.  Thanks to a series of bankruptcies in the United States, Ranger, Stratos and Champion bass boats now have the same owners, and they're looking to streamline costs.  If Stratos does move production to the Ranger plant (75 - 80 percent chance it will happen by the end of the year), then don't be surprised to see Champion Boats follow suit. Old-timers might remember the experimental twin-engine bass boat that Champion made in the '90s. Think 20-foot boat with a pair of 200s on it ...... it wasn't very good on gas, but it got you to your spot faster than anyone else.  As an FYI, Ranger already builds trailers for both Stratos and Champion. The idea behind consolidating the manufacturing into one site is to reduce overall costs by eliminating duplication and redundancy.  Stay tuned ....."
