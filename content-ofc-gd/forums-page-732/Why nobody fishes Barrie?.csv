427951,dks,2010-01-31 19:06:00,36,"I know that there is a warm water outflow by the Tiffen street boat launch, but, I've never seen anyone  ice fishing in the general area of Kempenfelt Bay near the downtown area of Barrie. Looking at fishing maps, it looks like it drops down quickly. I know there are huts by Minet's point, but, I've never seen anyone fishing close to the north side of downtown shore. Any reason for this? Seems like good access and parking?"
428005,Meegs,2010-01-31 20:43:00,249,"Ive caught whitefish not 30 yards from the barrie marina entrance and seen many others caught there as well.   just dont plan on going out and catching much every time you go out, one here, afew there, but definately no consistency!    same as minets, afew fish here and there but your never going to have a GREAT day off Minets!"
428044,irishfield,2010-01-31 22:20:00,26272,Can't be any worse than the lock jaw all over the lake today..
428066,12footspringbok,2010-01-31 22:56:00,459, Lock jaw i musta been lucky then....  Back to the original question. I used to fish quite often with my dad in barrie. Caught lots of perch and a few whitefish and the odd pike right off the marina entrance in about 35ft of water. We also used to fish out in front of the dream catcher and get some good jumbos. Like meegs said though is hard to find consistancy out there.
428067,Meegs,2010-01-31 22:57:00,249,They were by no means fast and furious today but we still managed 8 or 9 through the holes this morning!    Jigged a Meegs VERY VERY slowly was the only offering they would take!
428073,Guest gbfisher,2010-01-31 23:03:00,0,Wasnt to bad out there Wayne for half a day. You just had to get away from the crowd and find fish that were active....3 or 4 at a time. If just one fish would come in with no compitition you wouldnt get a hit. Was it you who lost their stuff?
428084,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-01-31 23:31:00,1362, Wayne was fishing the other part of the half day that they weren't biting and he likes to mingle with the crowds...
428121,Joey,2010-02-01 00:53:00,9122, Well if somebody had of lost two helmets then at least we could have left the parking lot
428131,Governator,2010-02-01 01:04:00,879,"I fished near the Marina early this morning just past the docks, caught squat though.  Not many jumbos being caught right there anyway.  Caught a few last weekend."
428686,Beans,2010-02-02 14:15:00,3339,Some of us have fished just to the left off of HOOTERS...perch and pike...
428766,dks,2010-02-02 19:01:00,36,"Thanks for the feedback guys, maybe I'll have to give that area a try this week.  Lots of parking at least and close to the ice. Beans, did you get the pike jigging or with bait?"
428836,moose,2010-02-02 21:43:00,266,drove from oro nine on saturday around 230 right to downtown barrie along lake and saw lots of guys out on north shore close to shore and saw a few good parking lots on long way to park
428898,Beans,2010-02-03 00:21:00,3339, Alas...I didn't catch any but I believe this one was caught using bait...  
429062,dks,2010-02-03 13:58:00,36,"Nice picture Beans, now I'm definitely going tomorrow to Barrie. I think I'll still target lakers and whitefish though....unless it's slow then the perch better be careful."
