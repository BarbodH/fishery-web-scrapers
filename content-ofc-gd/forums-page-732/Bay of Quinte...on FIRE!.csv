We are averaging 20-25 fish per day with lots of Walleye being caught in the 7-12 lb range! We have been able to locate some amazing fish who seem to be co-operating quite well! Multiple clients (as well as myself) have smashed our personal best fish!  Here are some pics from the past two weekends.  My new personal best... 10.5 lbs!     A client with a beauty 7lb'er   Grant from G2 with a MONSTER 11lb'er            For more pictures and info feel free to visit the G2 Angling Website"
