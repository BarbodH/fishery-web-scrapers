Started in 79 feet with a spoon and marked just 1 fish in an hour, moved to 112 feet, missed one on one of my jigs and it was dead again.  I moved to 106 and managed a nice little 4 pounder, natural, so back she went.  Made a move to 82 and hit the jackpot, I landed 4 more in just under 45 minutes.  My new jig took a beating.  Brought home 2 stockers for the smoker.  I've added pics of the jigs to my site for those interested! Scroll to the bottom  IMPACT! Fishing Co.    "
