429200,Leecher,2010-02-03 23:17:00,7832,"Question for you guys..... Planning on fishing in Ontario in the next few days if all goes according to plan and need to know what is required licensing wise for me to fish absolutely legit..... I checked the OMNR site and read about an outdoors card and fishing tags for non resident...... What the hell are they taking about??  In QC, it's real simple..... only need to buy a fishing license period.  It may sound simple to you folks but for me it only brings confusion     Please enlighten me.  I just want to make sure that I have all the necessary papers so that if I get stop by a CO, it will all be fine.  It may be a stupid question but to me, it's important that I know for my piece of mind Thanks guys Leechman"

429215,jjcanoe,2010-02-03 23:42:00,744,"card is good for 3 yrs and you can buy a 1-3 year sticker for the card.  Conservation sticker is cheaper if you don't intend to keep much, sport sticker is more expensive but has higher catch & keep limits"
429246,Leecher,2010-02-04 00:43:00,7832,  Thanks JJ for the info!!!  Much appreciated   I'm going to get my non resident card and a 1 year fishing tag.
429265,Twocoda,2010-02-04 01:24:00,4130,is Quebec still part of Canada ?
429269,tightline,2010-02-04 01:38:00,322,"not true Canadian tire does no longer carry the outdoors cards in ontario, southern anyway...hit a tackle shop or check the mnr web site for kiosks where you can pick them up...all you need is a temporary other then residence card and your good to go Leechman...there a little more expensive then what we residents have to pay but c'mon support your ontario fishing brothers anyway"
429287,Leecher,2010-02-04 02:19:00,7832, Sure it is   Thanks tightline!!!  Just got word from my friend Paul aka Whitespinnerbait that Sports Action 2000 on St-Laurent Blvd carry the outdoors card     Will be going there tomorrow to pick it up.
