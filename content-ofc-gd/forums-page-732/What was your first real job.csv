428740,JohnF,2010-02-02 17:37:00,3494,"Been trying to remember since this thread first appeared. I think my first job was in around 1955 when I took on my first paper route delivering the London Free Press. At the same time I was cutting lawns and later started doing some baby sitting. No recollection of the money but it was long enuf ago to be irrelevant.  Lawn cutting led to a summer gig running a Snapper for a commercial lawn care guy and then around age 15 I started working as a stock boy and carry out at the local grocery. Then a summer in a park tourist food booth. Learned a little meat cutting during the grocery years and that got me two summers with a packing plant. Didn't actually get to do any cutting but made a lot of bologna and sausage and put in many hours on the hog kill floor. Be glad to share bloody stories with any of you who care to listen and wanna become vegans.  Then I did a summer on railway spare gang, a summer of pouring concrete, a summer on road construction and then two summers of university summer school trying to fast track my degree. During this time I was working full/part time fixing lawn mowers, snowblowers and sleds. In looking back it seems that there were too many work summers for the years I was in school but I definitely had all the jobs. The above jobs were interspersed with the full time jobs below as I cast about ""finding myself"".  My first grown up job at age 19 fresh outa high school was back at the Freeps in the circulation department. That got old really quick and I took a turn in insurance claims adjusting. I wasn't hardassed enuf for that and packed it in to go into computer work. I ran an IBM 360/20 and was studying programming. Didn't take long to figger out I was meant to work with people, not machines, and so it was back to university for a few more years. In 1973 I talked my wife into dumping everything and heading for Europe. We backpacked around there for months until the wanderlust was sated. I was offered a job running a motorcycle shop in France but she wasn't interested in staying so on we went.  When I got home my sled racing experience got me a job offer in the Rupp sled distribution business. After a couple of years having too much fun for it to feel like a real job I figgered out that the sled industry was gonna get real small real fast so I bailed and got a real estate licence in 1975. That licence has kept me in groceries, cars and mortgage payments ever since. It'll do until I figger out what I really wanna be.  If you find this account confusing think of how it was for me.  JF"

It was straight commission. Most I've made was 140 in the 4 hours I worked thanks to this one guy saying how I didn't make enough. He practically bought the entire van! Next was Canada's Wonderland (Kidsville ride operator) for a summer for 8$ an hour. Seeing that I live in toronto, the commute was terribad in terms of time and money. Finally my current job is a huge improvement from the other two which is  a field archaeologist. It's dirty especially when it rains but I love being outside. My crew is mostly girls too.

428966,danc,2010-02-03 02:43:00,4677,"Cool thread. Here's my story. Worked at a mini putt for a few summers during high school for $1.25 an hour. It was nice to have some cash in my pocket. A couple of purchases I made back then were a Mossberg 20 ga. pump action shot gun, which I still use to this day for Grouse hunting, and a Martin 72 fly reel for Steelheading, which has long since been retired. Didn't know what I was gonna do after high school. Actually that bothered me quite a bit. Lots of today's high school aged teens don't seem to care what's on the horizon. But I spent many a sleepless night trying to decide on a career. Decided to go to grade 13 (remember that), and possibly university after that. The summer after grade 12 I got a summer job with Maclean Hunter cable tv. Loved the job. I met the nicest and the nastiest people on the planet hooking up cable. The best part was when I had to go knocking on peoples doors and ask them to pay up or they'd be cut off. People aren't happy when you tell them to fork out some cash or they wouldn't be able to watch Days of our Lives anymore. At the end of the summer they asked me to stay on full time. Having no real reason to go to grade 13, I took up the offer. I loved the job but wasn't too happy about the money or future to make more money. I was clearing $296.00 every two weeks (1976). Fourteen months later, someone gave me an in on a union sheet metal workers apprenticeship. I talked to to owner of the company and he promised me 3 months work, which was enough to become indentured in the union. Ended up working there for 21 years. Twelve years after that, I'm still in the trade and doing fine. I'm either sitting in an office estimating, or in the field as a foreman. I get paid well, have tons of benefits, and a very sweet pension. 6 years to go at the most."

I sure don't complain abou those days- fact is I kinda miss them.  Never got paid much, but always had what we needed with some extras thrown in for sure, and a university education.     If I have any regrets its that I didn't get a chance to give my two kids that same experience.  But they had plenty of what I would've called dream jobs - doing the Mc Donalds thing, working in retail, call centres and restuarants.

Now I know it sounds bad, but really this guy was completely unprofessional and a real, I still to this day feel he deserved what he got.  Anyways after that I slugged boxes at the LCBO distribution warehouse for a summer while in university made $10/hr. Then I moved onto the swanky Toronto Golf Club for half a summer until I realized that the hospitality industry and serving the wealthy elite was not for me and went onto work in another warehouse and factory for another making around 16/hr couple summers before finishing my degree.  When I graduated a few years back I took my first full time job as entry level accountant making 35K and after a few years of slogging away at work and doing my designation I graduated with my CMA and its been smooth sailing since.  Reading some of the other posts I certainly had it a lot easier than you guys from my parents generation.

Every time my dad hears that I’ve finished another set of up dating classes at Fanshawe collage; he laughs and says, I thought you were done with school. As for the younger generation wanting things given to them; that’s our fault. Who gave them their play stations, Xboxes, Cell phones or all the other crap they don’t need? I’m just as guilty, I gave my kids all that stuff; but when they wanted something; I’m the one that got paid. Paid in grades that is; no increase in their grade a school, they didn’t get. My daughter is now at first year law in Ottawa and my son will be graduating this year with his automotive engineering degree. He has interviews lined up with General Dynamic’s here in London. So for me it’s not what was given to them; it’s how it was given.  Dan."

428074,Spiel,2010-01-31 23:07:00,9065,"I've been buying my luxuries since I was 12, paying rent at home since I was 15 (cause I quit school) and on my own since I was 17. First house purchased at 19.  31 years in the steel mill now, with numerous layoffs and and a few strikes inbetween. Never asked anyone for a dime!  I've done pool instalations, snow remoaval, lawn cutting and leaf raking, interior painting and roofing to get me through the lean times.  My daughters now at 15 and 17 have both been working for a over a year and my son who'll be 15 this year will be working soon. Far to many kids have a sense of entitlement to things not earned. I refuse to allow my kids that lazy pleasure!  On top of this they have maintained scholarship grades.....thank the good Lord.  Steer the course and teach him that the guilty pleasures are earned, not handed to him."
428075,TJQ,2010-01-31 23:15:00,7806,"When I was 12...  I ran the kiosk at the local mini putt for $1 a day, plus a free lunch and all the mini putt I could putt!!!  When I was 15, I ran a bait shop for $3.50 and hour and counted worms for the most part.  At 16 I learned how to set blasting caps and worked a hand shovel on construction for $3.85 and hour.  As far as I'm concerned, I'm in no huge hurry to make my kids go to work.  They are gonna get to work their whole lives...  If they need extra cash.. I got lotsa jobs for them.  There's plenty of time to go to work for dickhead bosses in the future, and Im sure they will have plenty of those ""opportunities"".  Id rather show them how to make thier own money and not be dependent on the whims of employers and unions."

428079,SlowPoke,2010-01-31 23:23:00,2984,"Sunoco Gas bar, $2.xx/hr and bought a used Yamaha RD 400 when I was 16  http://www.manualesdemotos.net/catalog/ima...YamahaRD400.jpg Added drop bars, a Rickman fairing, expansion chambers and rear controls. It would eat the early Honda 500 Interceptors and spit 'em out!  Ahhh, good times and many tickets."
428080,danbouck,2010-01-31 23:26:00,4380,"I had the usual paper route for a few years, pumped gas in grade 10. In grade 11 I took a construction co-op which let me work all afternoon and evening and still get my school credits. Grade 12 I suckered them into letting me do the same thing again (this is the year I was rich)   Math and auto shop in the AM and work the rest, it was hard  Didn't work at all while I took Mechanical Engineering in College then I saw an opening at an elevator company and decided to drop off a resume even though I really didn't want that job. Now many years later I am a manager there lol."
428083,bigugli,2010-01-31 23:28:00,6138,"First job was 13 working for a family friend. Went to Simcoe for the summer helping in the tobacco fields for board, spending money and great fishing weekends on Long Point. Quit school at 15 and did every scab job that came my way to make a buck. Some of those early jobs were fantastic even if they didn't pay well. Went back to school at 18 after my first round of back problems."
428092,smitter,2010-01-31 23:47:00,106,"I grew up on a farm, so I've been working for as long as I can remember. Our farm when I was real little, neighbours when I got a bit older. Doing hay, barn work, field work, whatever.  When I was a real little kid, there was only 1 farm job we would get paid for, the rest was pro bono., picking rocks, 50 cents/hr. I remember at the end of the season, my dad handed me a check for 14 dollars. I planned on buying a ""transformer"" robot watch with the money, but when I went to the store to get it, I just remember thinking about how hard I had to work for that money and how the watch was not worth all that work. I left the watch in the store and put the money in the bank. It was a real pivotal learning lesson in my life. I think I was less than 10 years old at the time. Since then I've always been a real good saver.  Now I have a son, and I plan on teaching him about money the same way I learned. If you don't work for it, you're never going to have it."
428097,grt1,2010-01-31 23:57:00,638,"When I was 12 (1958) I worked at one of the local bowling alleys setting pins,  and got .03 per line of bowling, so on a league night I would make (5per team x 3 games bowled x 2 teams per pair of lanes x 2 leagues per night) equaling $1.80.  When I started with the Bell Telephone company of Canada in 1965 I was up to the whopping rate of $65.00 per 40 hour week.  Of course you could go to the movies for $1.50 back then."
428102,lookinforwalleye,2010-02-01 00:07:00,4399,First real job was in 1975 as a bag machine operator I think I made 2.50 an hour and with no bills to pay I thought I was rich. After that I got a job in a warehouse doing shipping and recieving and I am still with that company working my way up through the years and now on my 34th year and making alot more money but you know something I think I had more disposable income in 1975. LOL
428106,motion,2010-02-01 00:09:00,403," Amen! We can only guide them through life, we can't be there beside them always to make the right decsions. Thank God my son has taken on fishing as his favourite pass time. Gives us pleanty of time for bonding."
