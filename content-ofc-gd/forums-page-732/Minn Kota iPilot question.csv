I checked when I joined, way back in Feb of 2008, long time lurker, now for my question, Has anyone used a production iPilot on a Powerdrive or Terranova?  Comments on how well it followed a saved track.  Can you slow down the speed when following a recorded track.  I will be upgrading my current trolling motor if it works well, but I have not been able to find out much information on the internet so far.  Thanks"
429369,ohhenrygsr,2010-02-04 04:05:00,947,What i would do is go to your next Spring fishing show and ask the reps themselves.  It's a great learning experience.  I think this is the best show coming up to check out the new Ipilots  http://www.ottawaboatandsportshow.ca/
429447,ottawaguy,2010-02-04 14:59:00,11,I plan on attending the boat show in Feb. thanks for the reminder.  I would like some none paid comments on the iPilot system if anyone has any water time with them if possible.
429506,ottawaguy,2010-02-04 19:04:00,11,I found this being discussed at the MuskyHunter forum:  http://www.jasonhalfenoutdoors.com/iPilot2.html
429594,archie_james_c,2010-02-05 00:30:00,618,I'll probably wait for them to come out with something better....cuz..you know they will.  They'll wait till thousands but this one then they'll market one with 10X the features...
