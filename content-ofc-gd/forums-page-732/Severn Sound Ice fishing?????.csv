I try and get out every weekend for a mix of eyes, lakers, whities, pike, perch and herring.  Lately luck has not been on my side.  A few weeks back we were catching herring but since then things have slowed down.  Mind you i only fish one day if that per week up there, too many hobbies, gf and full time job dont help in my quest to fish the area.  All summer guys fish the area but come winter its almost dead unless you fish midland or waubashene, outside of that its barren.  Any reason why its so dead?"

429657,krawler,2010-02-05 02:13:00,167,"I read a lot of boards when im bored and do a lot of search's too.  Im not much of a poster, more of a reader but some things peak my curiosity and i cant resist so i have to ask.  Like i said very few if not any posts about the area on any board, does anyone fish it in the winter?"
429664,BillM,2010-02-05 02:31:00,17367,Not many people are happy about the slot limit out there
429665,AzuluSpookd,2010-02-05 02:34:00,348,"Slot limits no issue. It's sustained and improved the eye fishery there, no doubt. Two under 16.1"" are good eater! Even one over 22"" is a great eater!  There's tonnes of people out fishing around the whole entire areas."
429675,irishfield,2010-02-05 02:43:00,26272, ...they just don't talk about it!
