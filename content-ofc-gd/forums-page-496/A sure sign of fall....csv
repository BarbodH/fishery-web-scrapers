All fish were taken shallow, most on black/green or black/orange rac's.  Some fish are already turning black as night, while a couple were still just about chrome.  The old man had the hot stick for the first 3...   Then I started catching up... The high mark was about 23 or 24.   Managed this nice teenager on a big orange x-rap.  He lunged clear out of the water about 5 feet from the boat.   Hopefully one or two more cracks at these fish are in the books before it's too late...then it's fall musky and smallies. Tight lines."
