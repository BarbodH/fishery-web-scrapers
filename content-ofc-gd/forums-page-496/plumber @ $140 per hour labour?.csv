616645,pikehunter,2011-08-29 09:44:00,1659," UH HUH. I am simply amazed at what hourly rates are anymore, for any trade. Sorry, but even 80 bucks sounds like a lot to me, especially if it's out of my pocket."
616650,Billy Bob,2011-08-29 11:02:00,5865," YEP, I agree....taking into consideration that Med School is about $250K a doctor is a pretty good deal compared to a plumber.  And Roy, I twice went to a plastic surgeon....that's why I'm so damn pretty...  But you could use a plastic surgeon if you have PVC pipes in the house...LOL..."
616651,Daplumma,2011-08-29 11:09:00,1961,"  This will insure you pay top dollar every time.The way to get the best deal is to have a relationship with your tradesman,someone you have met thru social events or church or freinds.Dont just look for the cheapest guy in the phone book.Once you have that guy you can trust,let the man do his job.I give very few quotes,most of my jobs are less than $600 dollars.I'm not going to drive to a house for a $600 job that I may not get when I could run a service call and leave the house with a check.If someone pushes me for a quote I figure the job as if everything will go wrong the price reflects that.I alsp tell the customer it will prolly be cheaper to just let me get to work and trust me to bill fairly.On very large or new construction jobs quotes are fine because the scope of the job is a known quantity. Joe"
616653,grimsbylander,2011-08-29 11:28:00,3016,"  Next time I have a busted pipe, I going to church! Really? I was so busy schoozing the electrician, landscaper, dry waller and cabinet maker I forgot the plumber!"
616659,Roy,2011-08-29 11:52:00,13728," That's exactly how I do business, Joe."
616669,Daplumma,2011-08-29 12:21:00,1961,"  I think you missed the point.I suspect you are missing it on purpose for some reason.I'll try again,read this slowly maybe it will make sense.The best way to get a fair deal with contractors is to build a network of friends and business relationships where there is accountability for actions.In your case if your plumber was a brother of a buddy of yours you would be able to have a non confrontational discourse about your billing dispute.The plumber would have to justify his billing not only to you(a person who will likely never call him again)but also his best buddy,your brother.Thats a totally different dynamic now and you would likely get a break on the job and he would likely get more business from you as well as future recomendations by you to people in your network.Does this make sense to you? BTW,there are quite a few people at my church who have had busted pipes fixed at a fair price from a plumber they met at church.They have recommended me to their neighbors and one has an exellent bass pond that my brother and I enjoy fishing a lot. Joe"
616674,grimsbylander,2011-08-29 12:55:00,3016," It really doesn't matter what speed I read your condescending post, getting an honest job done at a fair price should not come done to who's within anyone's social network. Sure, you want to cut someone a break who you see every Sunday morning, that's awesome and it happens all the time. But what if you don't know a plumber? All I'm saying is it should be reasonable. I also understand that different tradesmen with charge differently based on experience, quality of work, timeline and work load. That's expected. The gentlemen who started this post was in a situation whereas he had no recourse than to hopefully discuss the bill and try to get it either back in line or he needs to understand the scope of work as to better understand the billing. This is a much easier conversation to has BEFORE the work is done. That's all I'm saying. And it doesn't sound like he had the luxury of ""knowing"" a plumber first. And BTW, I too am a licenced trademen and my father had his own plumbing, heating and electrical business. I am now responsible for a 16M a year company of which I subcontract approx. 800K a month. Not plumbing. All I expect from any of my subcontractors is they be open and honest. I expect them to make money. If they don't, I lose them as a go to option for future work and we both lose. I've even had subcontractor up their price if I think they're trying too hard or if I think they have misunderstood the scope of work. Ethics has to come into play at every level of business, including yours."
616675,solopaddler,2011-08-29 12:59:00,8605,"  What you're saying makes sense Joe.  But honestly I can't imagine anyone not asking for a quote. I mean seriously, no one calls a tradesman to do work on their house without asking for a quote."
616687,limeyangler,2011-08-29 13:31:00,5204,"morning people....thanks for all the replies.  I think the best way forward on this is going to be to just go through the bill with him on the phone.  Since my wife dealt with the call out and received the initial quote for $500 -$600 for the well line she has agreed to have the discussion with him first and see what happens.  We did not bother with a quote for the 2nd bit of work he did averaging out in our own heads what the cost would be based on a general idea of time/materials compared to the first job which seemed reasonable.  There is a question about the second piece of work he carried out was to solve the reason our deep well pump pressure switch was constantly cycling on and off....this just a few days after he had fixed the leak in the well line.  He spent a good few hours messing around with the pressure switch....this is when his assistant was basically there to hand him a wrench at @ $60 per hour.  After about 2 or three hours he said he realised he had put a valve or something on the wrong side of another join, and thats why he had taken so long to fix it....and that he would return in the next couple of days and fix the problem ,  and that he would not charge us to fix the mistake( mind you he was going to charge us for the initial work and screw up time).  Fair enough i thought....all this time not thinking i'm being charged double rate with his young padawan in tow.  So he comes back and does the work. he is there for another 2 hours.  All in all with well job thats 9 hours labour on the bill. The time is not broken down to dates...just a lump sum. I know he needs to take off at least 2 hours of that.  I am not happy that i was charged for his assistant to basically watch....i dont give a frigg about thats what normally happens...its not right...even though i understand that it would be difficult to turn the clock on and off for the assistant....well tough...do it...its my friggin money! If you know you are coming out to do ma certain type of job.  I did like the suggestion somebody made about asking what the young lads credentiALS ARE.   Anyway...thanks a lot for the replies people...some useful insights"
616692,Blue Lk,2011-08-29 13:41:00,337,"Simon,this is the main reason I learned all I could regarding rural water systems,if this guys name is Jack & also is a resident of your lake,he does great work but he ain't cheap.I found him reasonable to talk to about my bill. I have watched him work outdoors cutting thru 2ft of ice to change a pump in the lake at -40C,nobody has enuf $$$ for me to do that."
616694,limeyangler,2011-08-29 13:54:00,5204, Nope the guy is not called Jack...but if you would be kind enough to PM me his name and contact i would appreciate it.  I feel cheated by my parents  ....they pushed for me to study academic topics at Uni....i will definitely be pushing my son towards a trade...that way he can print his own money and be able to afford to pay for his own academic studies later in life if he chooses to do so.
616812,aplumma,2011-08-29 21:07:00,6896,I have in my hands a list that has different contractors that will do work at any of my customers houses for a reasonable price if they mention my name to them. The reason is they have all been screened by me and given the instructions that my customers are to be treated the same way I treat them... with excellence. If the customer is unhappy they are told to call me and I will mediate the issue. I have to this day never had to do this. I have run my company modeled after Daplummas company right down to making it unnecessary to advertise or even put a name or logo on the trucks. The business is word of mouth it means people are so happy they tell their friends who we are. Their is a trust built up even before you enter the door. While not normal keep looking their are companies that work the same old fashion way they earn your trust and you are grateful for a fair price and a great job.   Art
616816,blaque,2011-08-29 21:22:00,2419," Ive got a mechanic like you aplumma. And he'll get my business every time.  Matter of fact, hes right across the street from my office,.......and HE comes over to pick up my vehicle to take it over to the garage. HE brings it back to me and just leaves my keys with the receptionist. Doesnt ask to see me for payment, just does the work, drops it off, and knows ill be bye to drop off a check the next time i pass him. He tops fluids off no matter what hes servicing,... He'll tell me whats actually wrong even if its the cheaper fix (thanks ford dealership lol).....He even leaves little gifts on my seat for me like multi-tool swiss army knife kinda stuff LOL. Hes honest , fair , and if i get a steep repair bill.....i know its an honest one.  Ill pay for this guy all day long and KNOW that hes worth his weight in gold.  And ya know what he has in common with you.......Hes got NO SIGN on his garage, and NO logo on his truck. Word of mouth all the way and he gets plenty of good word!"
616831,aplumma,2011-08-29 22:12:00,6896,  I agree my auto mechanic is the same way he picks up my wife's car and fixes it then drops it off. I go by and pay him. He gets to repair all 4 of my vehicles and I TRUST him that is the key ingredient. A friend of mine truck wouldn't start I called Tim and asked if he could help. His help was to jump into their rollback drive 20 miles bring the truck in and find the ground strap on the starter motor was bad. Replaced the strap and handed the guy a $245.00 Bill towing and all. He was back running calls in 3 hours The next day he dropped of a case of beer and scheduled to have $1500.00 worth of work done. Look around folks their are some really great people out their to help you in your home repair needs Don't support the bad ones.   Art
616835,misfish,2011-08-29 22:29:00,29133," You are so right Art. There are good guys out there, My mechanic is awesome. Even if I dont have the cash to cover it,he tells me no worries.Come by when you can an pay."
616836,tb4me,2011-08-29 22:34:00,3295,"Simon,after reading all your posts over the years, I can tell your not an unreasonable man. Nor am I saying you are. Id call him up  and ask why his bill was so high.If he is a good reliable Plumber he will want you to be happy when handing him a cheque..Word of mouth means everything to these guys. Epically where you reside. I too am self employed and can understand where his $140.00 an hour comes from..Keep in mind tradesmen ticketed or otherwise have families to feed too. The only difference is they also have to maintain and purchase tools, trucks and insurance, this all before getting to your house. Then he also has his employees families to feed as well. That's where you the customer come in. The cost of living has gone through the roof lately..Now imagine the cost of running a plumbing business or otherwise. I'm not saying you shouldn't ask him to break down his price but do keep in mind that farmers do feed cities, however contractors build them...I would have also asked for a quote in writing up front..I good contractor wont have a problem with that. As for time and materials I wouldn't touch it EVER..There is always someone thinking they got ripped off at the end. Yes you may get the highest possible price from the contractor when you request a quote or estimate but then again you don't run into surprises at bill time.  Remember Simon us self employed folk want (need) you happy for referrals. Use that to your advantage when negotiating with him..Im willing to bet he will be reasonable, to put smiles on your faces..Good luck my friend"
616837,limeyangler,2011-08-29 22:34:00,5204,WOW..i never get this many replies on a fishing report.  lololol  Just kinda teasing.
616841,danbouck,2011-08-29 23:22:00,4380, Tell me about it
616843,Terry,2011-08-29 23:36:00,14456, I hear you
616846,misfish,2011-08-29 23:43:00,29133, Thats cuz you fish all the time. Do you have a real job?LOL
616856,toca,2011-08-30 00:14:00,274,If you are happy with the work pay it.  Your own fault for not getting a written quote.  Just think of it as a lesson in the future.
616878,limeyangler,2011-08-30 01:19:00,5204, i'm not happy with the work as it happens   i will learn from this regardless of the outcome.
616513,limeyangler,2011-08-28 21:01:00,5204,"hi all, just thought i'd ask....do you think this is fair/right...a plumber recently did some work at our place...he had an 'assistant' with him.  This looked like a kid doing his apprenticeship who stood and watched most of the time....only thing is the bill states we are being charged @$59 p/h labour for him on top of the plumber's $80p/h labour charge.  The $80 is the going rate for a plumber around here...but i resent having to pay $59 an hour for someone standing there watching /listening and handing the guy wrenches...i could be wrong but i'm pretty sure the kid doesn't get $59 an hour either.  Just thought i'd throw this out there...i know there are some plumbers on here...what do you think because i'm apt to argue this with the guy."
616514,Spiel,2011-08-28 21:05:00,9065,I wouldn't pay it.
616516,Twocoda,2011-08-28 21:09:00,4130,"Tell the plumber your not questioning ""his"" rate but ask to see the credentials of the assistant to justify the other 60 bucks....if he quoted the job and changed his price then thats another issue....if it was a ""service call"" then you may find yourself at the mercy of his ethics...  Good Luck Simon...try and express your views in a respectable mannner to the owner.."
616517,lew,2011-08-28 21:10:00,12766,Sounds way outta line to me Simon
616518,danbouck,2011-08-28 21:12:00,4380,Gotta remember there are many more costs that need to be included in an hourly rate.  Either way you shouldn't be paying for the apprentice. I never charge for a second guy thats on site if he doesn't need to be there and is watching
616519,daryl0815,2011-08-28 21:13:00,225,"that sounds ridiculous, if he wants someone there watching him, it should not be out of your pocket, I bet he was paying the kid minimum wage!"
616520,limeyangler,2011-08-28 21:14:00,5204,  lol...oh dear...my downfall usually when i'm pissed off.
616524,Roy,2011-08-28 21:25:00,13728,"It would only have coast you $21 an hour had you watched the job being done, Simon."
616527,mike rousseau,2011-08-28 21:28:00,4661,That's not cool...  If it's a job where 2 people are required I'd understand that... But to stand there with hands in his pockets for 59 per hour... I'd be upset too...
616531,limeyangler,2011-08-28 21:41:00,5204,"The general concensus seems to be leaning towards what my instincts were telling me.  I should elaborate a bit....sometimes the kid did help out lots...4 hours was pulling up the 220' well line to fix a leak...the guys worked their socks off in 2 feet deep melting snow on our lawn.  However...a lot of the time it was a kid watching.  I have not had the opportunity to look at the breakdown of the bill, my wife just called me (in tears) to tell me about it...its a couple 1000 more bucks than we have right now.....anyway....thanks for the replies so far...helps me not to go off on a rampage but count to ten so to speak....I LOVE THIS PLACE BTW!"
616533,bushart,2011-08-28 21:47:00,2628,SNOW????
616535,mercman,2011-08-28 22:15:00,7054,"Snoww!!!!  X 2 Cripes, in a couple of weeks yer gonna start posting Ice fishing pics"
616539,misfish,2011-08-28 22:23:00,29133," I could talk to him Simon.I could tell him""my boss likes to hear bad news right away""   Not to upset you any further,did you happen to catch the MANU game?"
616540,limeyangler,2011-08-28 22:26:00,5204,LOL...apparently it takes a while for the bills to come through too.  Yeah he did the work over a period of 2 months on and off starting at the beginning of May...yes...we still have plenty of snow in may!
616545,aplumma,2011-08-28 23:24:00,6896,If the job required 2 people to pull the well and it takes 2 people to put it back then yea the charge for two people is correct. It is not reasonable to expect them to stop the clock on the helper if he is helping the mechanic as he can. If they showed up to fix a toilet or install a faucet then the helper becomes a student and then he is free. This is normal for all of the trades and just by the nature of work and the expense of using two people on a job it would not be possible to charge by the work minute and be fair to either party.  BTW the $80.00 per hour is cheap compared to other places.   Art
616549,limeyangler,2011-08-28 23:42:00,5204, I completely understand and agree that the well was a 2 man job...but 2 guys to fit a switch?  as for the $80 being cheap here...yeah...so is housing compared to Toronto...its relative.
616552,toca,2011-08-28 23:54:00,274,Yeah it's normally 200 bucks an hour
616557,Billy Bob,2011-08-29 00:12:00,5865, If a plumber is making $200 per hour why would anyone want to be a doctor...
616560,Gerritt,2011-08-29 00:19:00,6129,Sorry to say... but sounds appropriate to me... all trades make $$ off their apprentices. Might have been best to get the job priced.... and not Time and Material (which this sounds like.)  I would bicker about it.....to see if you can save a few bucks.. but again this seems fair to me when you use a licensed trade.  G.
616570,grimsbylander,2011-08-29 01:14:00,3016,"Did you not get a quote up front? I always ask for a quote and state that ANY work that gets done beyond that must be approved or it would be paid for. That keeps people honest. Jobs don't get dragged out and I don't care if he pays his kid $1000 an hour. Oh, and not verbal quotes - written...quotes with a list of the work to be done and dollar amounts. Any good tradesmen/businessmen has no issue with writing a quote."
616571,danbouck,2011-08-29 01:20:00,4380,Problem with quotes is that they are much higher because they need to cover their   and don't want to lose money
616572,grimsbylander,2011-08-29 01:26:00,3016,"  That can happen and if the quote seems high, you can always say no. It's too late after the works done. Go get another quote."
616573,toca,2011-08-29 01:31:00,274," That two hundred bucks an hour is worked out based on his training, knowledge, and expertise. Also if you figure out the cost of expenses, time plus material that should very well cover that trades person. You can pay a guy 60 bucks an hour but when people cheap out and buy the material and the time to get them you are doing the trades person a favor. Sometimes its the luck of the draw by the hour or quote."
616575,Grimace,2011-08-29 01:33:00,2020,"Yeah but time and material is a license to print money.  Anyways, you can't have an apprentice on a stop watch.  So the kid works his arse off for 3 days knee deep in mud and snow and then you cut him off and send him home for the week with half a paycheck.  Next week he will be working for someone else.  It sounds like a big job was done, in the future if you have big jobs done without quotes, you should periodically 'check in' with the contractor to see what the costs are getting to be."
616627,Roy,2011-08-29 03:19:00,13728,You'd think that with all that money they'd be able to afford a plastic surgeon....specifically a crack specialist.
