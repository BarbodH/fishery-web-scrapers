616839,uglyfish,2011-08-29 22:41:00,981,"Hey luc, ill post the full results shortly. I have them in an email as I was there to fish the event.  I can say the first place finisher, matt stothers destroyed the field, with 14+ lbs on day one, then on day 2 with most of the field struggling to catch a limit, brought 18+ lbs to the scales topped with a 5.65lb smallie. It was the biggest smallie they said any of them have ever seen from that river. Got him day 2 big fish, for a pay out of $1010."
616874,LucG,2011-08-30 01:10:00,779,"Thanks ugly, I was just curious as to where I placed myself. I watch that big bag get weight in, was def. a nice smallie for that area. I had a poor first day, but had a pretty good second day, I knew I still didn't have a chance."

616890,uglyfish,2011-08-30 02:04:00,981,"i hear ya luc, i had a so so day 1, and had a better day 2. but lost a 3lb smallie day one at the boat, then lost a tank largie that was over 5 at the boat again sunday, either fish would have put me on the team. pissed me rite off lol, but thats how she goes. it was my first qualifier, i went in blind. never fished there before, prefished 2 days. but got a limit each day, and my buddy made the team.  caught more walleye and pike then i could count though!! haha"
616971,LucG,2011-08-30 12:22:00,779," Thanks again Ugly!  It was my first qualifier as well. I managed to finish 36th, what about yourself? I was fishing as a non-boater, and both my partners made the team. I definetly had a shot at it. Missed the cut by only a couple pounds, that's one fish...lol  Overall I had a great weekend, both my partners were good guys, and I can't wait to do it again next year."
617033,uglyfish,2011-08-30 14:15:00,981,"I finished 28th, yup missed out by about 2 lbs, and had 2 fish at the boat that would have put me on the team"
