From 55 to 90 feet off of Port Maitland , by the way Port Maitland sucks! 1 in 3 trips I get bit , nice fish usually 6-10 pounds. I think ill start fishing chrystal beech area more. At least i have success there. Lots of big marks and bait. Wonder if a Lowrance HDS with downscan can tell the difference between grunts and eyes, saw somescreenshots where you could tell they were crappies. I am of track now....Maitland sucks!  0.0 arghhhhhhhhh   Darren"

616300,Grimace,2011-08-28 00:27:00,2020,Fishing sure can give you that burn.  Crystal Beach has the best boat launch on Earth anyways.  Cheers.

616312,Grimace,2011-08-28 00:55:00,2020,"Yup I was there with the old man.  We were bass fishing.  I assume that was your bass boat up the point a ways?   We could see them swimming all over, finally got them to bite the crayfish DT-6.  I have only been out of the Crystal Beach launch 3 times. I really like the launch and parking lot and it is good water as well.  I have yet to haul out the dipsies and riggers for the eyes, probably next year.  Would have been cool to catch up with you at the launch.  Cheers Wayne.  As to the original poster - Lake Simcoe in the winter hates me.  It is just the way it is.  Lol."
