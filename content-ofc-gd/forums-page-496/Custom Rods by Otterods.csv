616073,aplumma,2011-08-27 00:22:00,6896,Is that a pergo floor or is it real wood.   Nice rod just messin with you.   Art
616083,EC1,2011-08-27 00:52:00,930,Wow these are beautiful setups. Hope you get some monsters with them!
616088,BillM,2011-08-27 01:07:00,17367,Hopefully the second setup is for a woman.
616097,misfish,2011-08-27 01:16:00,29133,"Very SWEET.  Can I ask,,,,,,,,  What is the warranty ?"
616100,Gregoire,2011-08-27 01:17:00,1397,"NIce setups. I have a patriarch 9525 that I have on a st. croix avid, but am not really happy with it. Have you had the spinning rod on the water yet?"
616104,GBW,2011-08-27 01:22:00,8460,"Can any dude fish with you and borrow the spinning combo?  If so, can I come fishing?  don't mine the tape I put over the decal of ""Princess Limmilicious"" while I borrow that combo.  So are we good?  Either way, NICE gear you got for yourself!"
616105,GBW,2011-08-27 01:23:00,8460,"sounds like a date to me...  ah no, here we go I'm makeing more work for Art again today so someone else bail me out!"
616139,Gregoire,2011-08-27 03:29:00,1397, Not going to comment on that...but those are some mighty nice rods
616232,nexstar,2011-08-27 16:36:00,63,wow. those setups are awesome. I see that you have some nice toys in the background too.
616246,mbosh1980,2011-08-27 17:51:00,349,"Is it the beers I've had this aft, or do the guides on the casting rod not line up? Nice setups anyway Edit: now that I read the description it seems like it is done on purpose...curious as to why?"

616532,Roy,2011-08-28 21:41:00,13728," The concept has been around for a long long time and is possibly the best method of guide placement on a conventional (read baitcasting) rod. When a rod is under load with a heavy fish, having the last guide (the tip) at the top will exert far more tension in the rod than if the tip guide was on the bottom. Less effort is needed to reel in a fish. Fewer tip fractures due to torsion at the tip of the rod."
