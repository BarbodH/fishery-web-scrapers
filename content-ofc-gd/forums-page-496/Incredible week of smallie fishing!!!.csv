Not much sleep for me this summer, and its looking like a busy couple weeks ahead. Friday August 12 My dad is moving to Halifax tomorrow and last Friday, with our schedules, was our last chance to fish together prior to him leaving. We took full advantage and headed out to Simcoe. Even my brother Mike came along for a couple hours. Unfortunately the couple hours Mike came out for were brutally tough and we only got 1 small fish. We dropped Mike off and headed to a different area.  Again the fishing was tough, then dad hooked one on a dropshot and it was on.  We landed close to 20 fish, all good quality.  Got a couple crankbait fish, though most came on the dropshot.      In the video above I needed a swim in the heat and the fishing was too good... new sport? It was exhausting actually!   Weighing my big five. Saturday August 13 I took a couple friends out on Saturday to try and get on the smallies again.  My first spot was our skunk spot from the day before, and guess what, they were back in full force.  Amazing the difference a day can make.  We never left the spot all day as we had no reason to, they were loaded and feeding.  We didnt catch the quality from the day before but they were still big fish and we got more on jerkbaits though my biggest was on a slammer.  Landed about 15 fish.     Sunday August 14 Sunday we had a club tournament on Lake Muskoka.  Its tough to leave Simcoe to go catch smaller fish haha. I havent been up there all year so we just had to play it on past experience. We headed right to a good flat that I like and we got a limit each (4 fish each) really quick but they were small 1.5 - 2 pounders.  We hit about 15 waypoints without a sniff.  We headed back to the flat and kept weeding through the fish and slowly upgrading ounce by ounce.  We came in to weigh ins dissapointed in our weights. I only had 8.20lbs for 4 fish and Adam had 7.75lbs.  It turns out it was a tough day all around and to our surprise our 15.95lbs bested the field. I'll tak the W.   Monday August 15, Tuesday August 16 Monday I headed down to Rice Lake to take a group of regulars.  Monday evening, even with scattered storms which brought us to shore for a while, we managed some good fish on dropshots and flipping jigs. They kept 5 for the pan, still plenty released. Tuesday the bite was scattered and really tough.  We managed about a dozen good bass but nothing huge. They were happy with the day nonetheless and if they're happy, I'm happy. There was even a PB smallie in there.     Wednesday August 17 I was pretty burned out by this point, but when I got off wok at 7am I was back out on Simcoe with my cousin's boyfriend Darryl.  He loves fishing but doesnt get out much.  We had a good day out there landing a dozen quality bass.  Fish were deeper today than they have been but still great fish! Everything on a big ISG tube today and they were all coughing up crayfish.     I TOOK THURSDAY OFF TO SLEEP!!!  Friday August 18 Friday I headed to Georgian Bay for the day.  We spent half the day fishing water we've fished before and half the day exploring.  As G-Bay seems to go, there were quality fish everywhere. I'm very impressed with G-Bays fishery though it slips my mind too often.  We got fish on a variety of baits, nothing really standing out.      Hope you enjoyed and as always I appeciate all feedback  I'll be adding a couple videos shortly"

We've fished the northern end, strawberry island, trout shoal etc. and found a couple decent sized smallies but our inexperience on the lake is catching up, not much to show for it.  Great to see so many quality fish!!"
613854,mattp33,2011-08-20 15:26:00,290,You got a couple of hogs there!   I hope I have the chance to follow your boat around 1 day on simcoe.   I have fished a bit there but can never seem to get any consistency.  Good fish!!!
