616496,Roy,2011-08-28 20:23:00,13728,A little difficult to answer without knowing how far you're willing to travel and where your starting point is. Do you have a boat and what size is it. Do you want day trips or camping/lodging......
616497,purekgw,2011-08-28 20:24:00,585,it would be for a weekend so like 5hrs tops maybe a little more if it worth it (we are in caledonia)
616498,purekgw,2011-08-28 20:24:00,585,we have a 17.5 crestliner with 115 and camping most likely
