616417,coolwater,2011-08-28 15:46:00,43,Has anyone fished at the Tyneside Rd end.  It looks pretty marshy and hard to fish.	Thanks

616698,Rich,2011-08-29 14:45:00,3927,If you do some mud tromping you can easily catch some carp from shore in that area. Not really worth trying to fish for anything else in there though.
616721,solopaddler,2011-08-29 15:52:00,8605,I walk my dog on the Tyneside trail almost every day.  The trail is 2km long.  Near the end there's a couple of spots where I always see TONS of carp dimpling and rolling.  If you're into carp I'd say go for it.
