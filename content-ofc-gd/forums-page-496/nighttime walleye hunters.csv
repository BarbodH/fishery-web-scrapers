616431,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-28 16:06:00,130,"Like manitoubass It takes some time for my full night vision to kick in.  But walleye are not people and fish vision is not the same as people vision so I can't draw conclusions based on my own eyesight experience. Also, maybe the walleye need time to settle down before they start feeling more aggressive...again based on my experience. I like to relax, settle down, mingle, check things out......then food."
616585,Kwan,2011-08-29 02:06:00,132,"i always believed in this as well, walleye are hardly ever caught right after sunset, and right before dark the fish go on frenzies"
616591,mike rousseau,2011-08-29 02:19:00,4661,I have a steady bite on cranks from 5pm-1030pm  No slow down at or before or after dark...  And that's trolling a lure without scent 2 mph...  From what I've seen... Their eyes don't need to adjust...  But that's my personal experience so far...
616622,Roy,2011-08-29 03:09:00,13728," Yeah, I don't see any harm in a walleye unwinding and having a few drinks before supper either."
617072,F_ast,2011-08-30 15:47:00,154,"During night time, I have had good luck on rocky shoals.  If the daytime is crawling with baitballs suspended over open water, the shoal bite picks right up.  I am talking larger shoals though.  Any other cover like weed patches, bolder fields or exposed surface rock helps too.  Trolling body waits is the way to go.  I have never done as well on the jig at night."
617075,Kwan,2011-08-30 15:54:00,132,  hahahahahahaha
617097,mike rousseau,2011-08-30 17:10:00,4661,i get to fish tonight wed and thur night this week  i love my GF  i also have a partner for all 3 days...  i have the time to fish... and a start to the night pattern... this weeks goal is to expand on the pattern and boat 30-50 eyes...
615571,addymark,2011-08-25 19:36:00,69,"this summer has been the first year trying night fishing... I would head out for 8pm and consistently hit decent fish right before the sun went fully down. once total darkness hit i would have no luck.  This thread just inspired to get out there around 11 and try it for a couple of hours.  Lets see how this weekend goes       It's funny you said black...  I have been using an original rap black and silver getting hits, then my dad and brother have been coming and getting more hits on a lime green split rap.  Might be more sound coming from that and less dependent of the colour.   Also had a nice musky follow on the surface in the propwash 2 weeks ago.. didn't have any musky gear but would have abeen a nice fish"
615575,Hooked,2011-08-25 19:39:00,891, Remind me to follow you next time you go out.
615577,Jigs,2011-08-25 19:43:00,136," That's really cool. Your brother mentioned them coming up that way at night to me too. Makes sense there's deep water nearby, rocks, weeds, lots of baitfish etc.  Definitely close for me. I should try that sometime.  I bet you they come in the bay right in front of my place too. Probably really scattered though."
615578,Harrison,2011-08-25 19:43:00,2202," Dark coloured baits are the norm.  Something the fish can shilouette against. i.e. when the frog deal is on, try a black pop r, spook jr , or frog bait right up shallow to the shorleine.  It's a blast.  I am super pumped to try the new mini live target frogs for the walters soon."
615580,addymark,2011-08-25 19:46:00,69,  i love fishing topwater.  didn't think that would work for eyes but i will definitely give it a shot. going to have to look into this frog migration as well.
615583,mike rousseau,2011-08-25 19:58:00,4661,    they kinda concentrate on the rock coming off the point as well as the next point east...  ive seen em in less then 1 foot of water... ive also pointed my  light in water...and it looked like somebody threw a roll of quarters in the water... so many eyes... but tough to catch...
615590,Jigs,2011-08-25 20:13:00,136, I would imagine. Casting might be a better option in such shallow water.
615625,fishindude,2011-08-25 21:37:00,220,"Having limited experience catching nighttime wallies myself so far, there's not much to say that hasn't already been mentioned in here.  Although I would like to contribute these articles I came upon with some pretty good info methinks:  http://www.in-fisherman.com/2011/07/19/baits-for-shorecasting-walleyes/  and  http://www.in-fisherman.com/2011/07/18/boatless-fall-walleyes/  Last year my success came from bombing out long minnow baits and reeling them in steadily. This year I plan to focus more on the soft plastic shad baits, and jig fishing.  Good luck all"
615659,manitoubass2,2011-08-25 23:38:00,11391," If your near a shallow sandbar, night fishing top water walleyes can be really productive.  It;s funny though, Harrison might chime in on his experience, but I find I have to have a very slow retrieve with a frog for top water walleye. I cast to my spot, let the bait sit for about 15-20 seconds, give it a quick jerk, then rest again. If I fish it any faster I never have any strikes. That might just be where I'm fishing though???  Another option is drop shotting minnows leeches or crawlers, works well before and after the bite really turns on, might help you land a few extras on your outing   "
615699,NAW,2011-08-26 01:15:00,4022,"I love the night troll for walters.  All alone in the darkness, nice and quiet on the water.  There's a river that I fish a few times a year, and the only time I can seem to get a walter bite is a night. We don't leave camp till around 9, and return at 12ish.  There's current there, and lots of ups and downs, so I'm not sure the exact depth they hit at.  Somewhere between 5 and 15 feet.  Trolling wally-divers, or rattle traps."
615891,mike rousseau,2011-08-26 17:33:00,4661,Had a close encounter with a boat running cigarettes last night...  Heard him coming so I turned my lights on... He then did a doughnut around my boat with a spotlight on me... I figured he was heading back for another load and was checking if I was a cop...
615906,manitoubass2,2011-08-26 18:05:00,11391," That sounds pretty sketchy!    Yum salted dingers work well for nighttime walleye also. I use them mainly on a jig head and basically let them sit on bottom, or texas rigged with a split shot about 14"" from the hook. I like the black/silver tail ones"
615925,walleyejigger,2011-08-26 18:33:00,876,"I've had most luck at sundown till about midnight, later than that I find the bite really dies off,  Always had best fishing trolling raps and bombers over deep water, very slowly, just enough to get a little wiggle out of it  Best night was 12 pickerel between 4 and 7 lbs in a hour n a half span, we were even catching them while letting our line out  Best producing bait for me this tear have been Tennessee shad husky jerk and baby pike bomber"

616007,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-26 22:12:00,0,"My best walleye fishing on the st. mary's river is as the sun sets, and as late as about 1am.  Best fishing for me is typically 9:30-11. In the evening the fish seem to move onto the inside seam of the main current in shallows they won't go near in daylight.  Some evenings I can even walk along the boardwalk downtown and see the fish in as little as a 2 fow.  Typically I have caught my fish in the river in less than 10fow once it gets dark.  As others have said, I don't even bother going down until it is getting dark as at least in my home waters, the fish become active at night.  On local inland lakes I seldom catch a fish once it gets dark, presumably because I'm not fishing in the right places."
616087,Jigs,2011-08-27 01:07:00,136, Exactly why I stay near the bonfire around here at night.
616119,johndox,2011-08-27 02:23:00,54,When we fish Rice lake we always do night fishing for walleye and usually go out about 7:30 or 8 pm and troll the shore lines of islands etc till around 2 am and usually have good luck after dark. Being along the shoreline the water depth varies quite a bit but like someone said in a previous post make sure you are prepared with headlight and flashlights etc to make it easier to get the fish in the boat properly.
616122,NAW,2011-08-27 02:32:00,4022," Boat lights, head lamp, flash light, and sometime I'll take my 3,000,000 candle power spot light too."
616328,Kwan,2011-08-28 03:11:00,132,"  yeah rice lake night walleye can be loads of fun i've never tried it on a boat, though"
616337,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-28 03:30:00,130,"A lot of people are mentioning the hours of the day for feeding times. In mid July the sun is up until 10pm or so....but now it is going down around 8:30.  Does this time change during the year?  PS: to the person that asked about walleye taking time to adjust to the dark...all I can say is that I have heard it too, it makes sense and catching fish after sunset is usually tough."
616338,ctranter,2011-08-28 03:32:00,543,"I fish dams at night.  Bite usually starts at around midnights and last until 3-4 am.  Last week (my fav dam) spat out 3 walleye over 20"".  Kwan, not sure if I've run into you yet but maybe I'll see ya out there."
616349,Terry,2011-08-28 09:48:00,14456,"do walleye take a while to adjust to the dark I don't know but do you have to take time to adjust to the dark...not if you are outside the whole time. if you go from a lighted house to the dark you need to adjust, that takes less then a minute walleye that the 45 minutes as the light levels are changing to dark, I doubt they need much more time once it's dark as they were adjusting all along  just logical thinking , not scientific"
616354,manitoubass2,2011-08-28 11:47:00,11391,"   I didn't see anything in this topic that suggested walleyes need to adjust to the lighting???? Maybe my eyes aren't adjusting well this am? hehe  I know when I night fish walleye, I get out early for my eyes to adjust, it just seems easier for me, I'm not stumbling around tripping on things and such   edit. Sorry Terry. Some good points there! But I should have quoted whitbyboatguy, lol"

615356,bubbles,2011-08-25 11:39:00,591,"How shallow did you find them?  Is there a ""dead"" period?  I have always found that after the sun goes down they die right off."
615361,lew,2011-08-25 11:59:00,12766," We wouldn't even head out until sunset and then the bite would usually last 2-3 hours then shut down. Always had the most luck in around 8 FOW.  This was always in May, I don't know how it works the rest of the year as that's the only time I ever fished for pickeral."
615366,Roy,2011-08-25 12:32:00,13728,Sure you can catch walleye in the hot midday sun but the absolute best time is from dusk 'til dawn. My PB hit at 11pm on the Larry on a dark moonless night on a large blue and silver Rapala floater. They can be anywhere but usually in the shallows no deeper than 15 fow.
615369,mike rousseau,2011-08-25 12:37:00,4661,Most of my walleye spots slow down an hour after dark...  What type of structure are you guys targeting???  I usually fish 15-20 FOW...
615372,lew,2011-08-25 12:47:00,12766,"Surprisingly, one of our most productive night time spots was a barren mudflat with very sparse weed growth in 8-10 FOW."
615378,Roy,2011-08-25 13:10:00,13728,"This particular spot runs 3'- 4' fow with no current from shore to 50' out then drops steadily to a depth of 40' with current. As the sun sets, pickeral will start feeding on easy prey in the shallows (0 to 12 fow and no current...no weeds to speak of either). They have a huge advantage with their vision in obscurity, speed and teeth."
615380,mike rousseau,2011-08-25 13:13:00,4661,ill rephrase...  what depth do you get your walleye in in the daytime? and what depth at night...?  so i can have a comparison to my waters...   please.......  i have spots that the walleye stack up on at dusk... but they seem to disapear an hour after dark...  these spots are mostly sandy... and gradual drop off to deep water... or flat saddles...          thanks roy...
615384,Harrison,2011-08-25 13:21:00,2202," Now there's an oxymoron.  Night is my Fav time for jerking up giant eyes.  They are in the same water you get them at dusk, I give them a couples hours to ""adjust"" and then they will eat.  Usually head out a couple hours after pitch dark.  Works for me anyways.  I like to target the deep weed edges."
615389,mike rousseau,2011-08-25 13:30:00,4661,Oxymoron...?  We have very large and flat saddles in my area...  Unless there is another word for it...?   
615398,discophish,2011-08-25 13:45:00,392,"I don't bother fishing the couple of hours after sunset.  It's rarely productive.  Wait until the next feeding cycle.  I have caught my best at night while trolling large minnow baits, flat lining over deep water for the high suspending eyes.  You will be surprised what this will bring to the side of the boat.  Go big and noisy with the lure selection.  Give it a shot and good luck."
615435,Fish4Eyes,2011-08-25 15:18:00,1022,I could of sworn I read an article saying that the eyes of a pickeral require time to adjust to the darkness once it is dark. While they are adjusting they cannot see anything and thus do not feed. I bet alot of them get taken during this time period my a muskie. Can anybody confirm this?
615439,tb4me,2011-08-25 15:30:00,3295,Great thread guys! Keep it going..I always wanted to night fish for eyes on a river...Any tips? I do have a boat.
615456,bubbles,2011-08-25 16:06:00,591,I am headed up north and want to give night fishing a try this year.  We typically fish the sunset and once that dies call it a night.  The more I have been reading indicates the big girls come up to eat in shallow water at night.  Maybe I have to give it a hour or two after sunset????  this is a great thread.
615460,Harrison,2011-08-25 16:13:00,2202," Mikie, just kidding around, I find'em funny, and no, there is no other word you nailed it.  tb4me, fish the same areas you would in daylight but use faster baits. Reason being the walleye will be out cruising more as their eyes will not be as sensitive inthe low light.  Also, very soon is the frog migration, top water walters is a blast at night."
615465,manitoubass2,2011-08-25 16:22:00,11391,"When walleye fishing during dark, I always do best around 11pm-2am. Around Rainy, the best walleye bite goes in certain time frames. 8pm is the last productive bite of the day for me, so the next feeding cycle starts around 11. I usually head out earlier though to get set up and get the eyes used to the adjusting light.  I like to fish sand and mud bottoms at this time, and anywhere from 1-12ft. Sometimes the walleye are virtually on shore, lol. I cast right at shore, just like bass fishing. I still use the same baits for the most part. But shallow cranks and flicker shads etc are a blast when there shallow.  I also like an area with some current, not heavy current though.  and as mentioned before, top water frogs and walleye are very fun, just not crazy productive. It's not everyday you get to experience a top water bite with walleye!  Oh, and I like black baits, anything black or with some black on it"
615467,mike rousseau,2011-08-25 16:23:00,4661," ok... thought i might have been using the term ""sadle"" wrong...   also...  anybody trying night fishing should realize you have to be very very prepared...  headlights are a must... and flashlights help...  have your net and pliers readily available...  and keep your boat as tidy as you can...  make sure your boat lights are working...  a gps really helps because you sometimes cant see shorelines.."

615542,bassmaster4,2011-08-25 18:54:00,801,where i go at night i fish from shore and the water is about 6 feet deep at the deepest point lost of current as well the bite is pretty steady until around 3 am then it shuts down.

615552,Jigs,2011-08-25 19:13:00,136," Aquaman only plays during the day and with a watcher in the boat.  To be very honest this lake kind of humbles me at night. I wouldn't mind going out to a few close spots but there's so much crap floating around, not to mention shady characters running with no lights....  Personally I kind of like to stick to daytime around here and just like Mike said my spots stop producing right after sunset anyway. But I've heard stories of walleyes coming in really really shallow at night around here and have to admit I'm a bit intrigued at the idea of trying a night bite.  I'm learning something in this thread I didn't know the bite slows a couple hours after sunset and gets better later in the night."
615563,daryl0815,2011-08-25 19:25:00,225,"     I am not a great Walleye expert, but I know a little bit,  During mid-day, look in deeper water, 8-20 feet, targeting thick weeds with bucktail jigs, other weedless presentations etc.  At night they move in very shallow to feed, I have heard of them going into less than 1' of water!, but smaller bays and closer to shore for sure, and they dont hang so deep in the weeds at night either, I have done well in the past using minnows on Lindy rigs fishing from shore with a light on the tip of my rod to see the slightest strike.  I hope this helps somewhat!  Daryl "
