Thank  has this happened to any of you guys trying to sell stuff with Kijiji or Craigslist.? is there a way to report them?"
616604,ckrb2007,2011-08-29 02:37:00,449,I get those all the time on kijiji when I sell stuff. You recognize the scammers pretty easily after a while.
616608,redskullz,2011-08-29 02:42:00,55,"I have bought and sold a few things on kijiji and shipped through the mail and have had no problems. This does sound a bit shady, but it may be legit. I would personally talk to him or email and make sure that the payment sent is a canadian money order, and the bow will be sent via tracked canadian mail. Make sure you receive the money and it clears before you send the bow. What kind of bow is it btw? Right handed take down recurve 50-55#? lol"
616610,Roy,2011-08-29 02:43:00,13728,"Write him back and ask him if he minds that the item is in a size 16.  edited to add: Redskullz, you wouldn't happen to have a really nice boat for sale would you? I have to be away on a business trip but I'm sure we can work something out."
616611,irishfield,2011-08-29 02:47:00,26272,Was gonna say Roy... he's gonna wake up one day to realize there was sand in the vasoline !
616626,redskullz,2011-08-29 03:19:00,55," LOL...yeah after reading it again more closely, yeah sounds like a farce. I do have a 15' flatback canoe with a yamaha 2hp i can sell you...say $14,500? Can you send payment via western union? I can ship the boat via canada post lettermail."

616634,redskullz,2011-08-29 03:50:00,55,Cool bow!
616638,shadowfly,2011-08-29 03:56:00,84,thanks Dude.
616639,mike rousseau,2011-08-29 04:03:00,4661,Got the same thing... If they never put what the item is exactly in their reply... Just ignore em...  Scanners use a general reply that they can copy and past over and over again... And use terms like item
616640,crossover,2011-08-29 04:11:00,172,"Avoid, they use stolen credit cards"
616654,mercman,2011-08-29 11:30:00,7054,  too funny.
616682,lplp,2011-08-29 13:14:00,83,"A scam for sure, i get them once in awhile also, one guy wanted my landscape trailer to russia ,, I couldnt figure out how to wrap it."
616683,hutch4113,2011-08-29 13:17:00,374," I had it happen when selling a used car on Autotrader.  The guy wanted the car really bad, but unfortunately being an Oceanographer, was currently out at sea for 2 months.  But not too worry...he had an agent ready to buy the car, sight unseen.  (It was strange however to see an email from someone who I would expect to be highly educated...filled with so many spelling errors...guess they didn't know how to use spell check...  )  If I understand correctly the scheme works this way:  1)The ""agent"" comes to buy the vehicle, but has a money order (or some other form of cheque that looks real) for more than the asking price.  2)Asks you to cash it, which the bank will do in most cases, as the money order is often legit.  3)They take car and the ""extra"" cash.  Bank contacts you later to advise the account the order was drawn on is either in overdraft/closed/or the order was reported stolen.  Of course..guess who is on the hook.  They can do the same thing with Paypal.  The Variation there -> they use a Credit Card to make the payment via Paypal.  Once everything has transferred, the purchaser calls the credit card company, and advises their card has been stolen.  Credit Card company won't transfer to Paypal.  You end up having to register a dispute, which can take years to clear.  As far as reporting it...have not found any place.  Best is what you have already done...word of mouth, so that sellers can be aware."
616699,solopaddler,2011-08-29 14:49:00,8605,  Well then why not notify the person you'll accept the offer then call the cops explain the situation and set up a sting?
616701,FrankTheRabbit,2011-08-29 14:50:00,479,Best case scenario is to deal locally and in person. Too many scams out there to take a chance with shipping or purchasing an expensive item.
617020,mistaredone,2011-08-30 13:49:00,913,But then there would be no time to give speeding tickets or time to play slap ass at the station. 
617042,Rizzo,2011-08-30 14:29:00,4754, haha don't know what this means but it made me laugh. Reminded me of the Simpson's episode where they put a squirrel in one of the cops pants
