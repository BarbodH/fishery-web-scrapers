616950,skinny,2011-08-30 11:12:00,442,ok I have to get back on top of things first money wise. Last weekend the kids and I had a opertunity to go camping in a friends R/V. We were not to far from home the kids had a blast (so did I). My wife had to work friday night and Sat morn so she joined Sat night. Know she is saying a R/V would be cool to have. She started by saying a camping trailer that changed when she realied I wouldn't be ale to take the boat.  is there a total length limit of r/v plus towed. I saw a good deal on a big R/V that has engine issues. I was thinking it might e worth doing the repair. Then I got thinking is there a length limit to tow. the boat is a 16 ft lus the trailer tounge then the length of the R/V say in the case of the bad motor 37ft that would make for a long unit on the road   if one is looking at R/V's what stuff do you need to watch for

Rv`s are expensive and costly to maintain and gas is 1.30/litre and not going to get any cheaper and Rv`s get around 7 mpg, and you gotta park these things too. Must be one heck of a job you landed, not trying to be mean or anything but if there is extra money after the bills are paid ya might want to stash it in case the new job does not work out."

Someone here once said in a report that if you don't have something to look forward to, then it's a crappy way to live....or something like that!  Good luck!"
