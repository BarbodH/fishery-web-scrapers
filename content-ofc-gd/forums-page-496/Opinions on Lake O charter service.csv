My mom was awesome enough to book a full day charter for us with Reel Release on Lake Ontario for 2 weeks from now and I'm wondering if any members have had experience with this outfit? This is our first time with a charter and first time on the big water so we have nothing to compare to. Thanks a bunch  PM me if you like."
