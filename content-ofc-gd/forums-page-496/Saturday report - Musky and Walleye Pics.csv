He recently gave me a bunch of great suggestions in terms of purchasing a rod and other equipment for Musky fishing and I was really anxious to get out there and try the new toys. I've caught a number of muskies around here but this was my first Musky that wasn't ""accidental"" ha ha. And if it's not my personal best it's pretty darn close. I fish exclusively for smallmouth and walleye and wanted to get into Musky fishing so I got in touch with Mike because I really wanted to make sure I was buying good gear.  We made a decision last night at 5:30pm that Sunday was going to be a bit much weather-wise so we headed out last night instead. Based on the results, and what the weather looks like right now I think it turned out to be a good move. To anyone who is thinking about fishing with Mike don't hesitate to hire him. He knows how to put people on fish and is great company in the boat. He is passionate about what he does and that's something you just can't fake if you ask me. Many thanks again Mike and next time's on me. For those who read stfrancisjigger.com stay tuned for a full report of the last 3 weekends and more pics and vids coming up mid-week or so.       Since I headed out for walleyes that morning I figured a couple of pics couldn't hurt We did really well. Here are two of the larger fish. All in all definitely not a bad day on the water.    "

616427,Jigs,2011-08-28 16:00:00,136, That would be fun. Thanks Paul! I don't keep very many fish but I kept a few yesterday and made some of my special fish roll sauce. Yummy!  Oh and speaking of sauces Mike was raving about your BBQ sauce I'll definitely need to try me some of that sometime.
