616311,MCTFisher9120,2011-08-28 00:52:00,3761,"Well good evening OFC! I just returned home from a very busy summer, working for 9 weeks at Kesagami Wilderness Lodge as a guide then home for a week and since then I have been camping for the last 4 weeks fishing here and there and having a blast. Same area as last summer visiting my great grandmother and family. Gram turned a big 103 this August, we are soo lucky to have her with us still. She is in good health and state of mind. She loves having us every suummer.  Anyway let's talk about the fishing. At first it was hard, I caught lot's of fish but for the life of me at first I could get nothing over 3lbs, they were all nice 2's and the bait's I threw were Snag Proof froggy's and jigs the odd time but as you will see many were on frog's. Here are some pictures to start before I show the bigger bass. I fished the main lakes and channel's this summer. The biggest of the bass came half way through the month.        A little scenery of the water I was fishing      Tried some deep water ledge fishing with different baits      Drivin my boat    My Dad with one of his nicer catches      This picture is funny, same weedbed same corner night to night produced two nice 3's      Here is a picture of a 4.1 on the froggy    Picture two of the fish    During the trip I decided to paint my boat...took 3 days off and did a nice paint job  Before pic    After pic    One of the memorable catches, a nice northern I slammed in the weeds behind me on a scum frog, what a pull I had to give to get this fish out of the cover    There is a just under 4    Picture of a morning 3lbr    I had a great trip this summer and didn't experiment with different baits as much as I should of but like my PB 6lb 14oz I slammed two 5lb largies within 3 days in the same little bay over 8ft of water on the famous Rapala Skitter Pop(2"")  5.0 First Picture of the hawg, loved the fight on the ML Croix Avid and the Stradic, was nice to get a big bass on a spinning rod    Picture two    This bass weighed a little more at 5.3lb's. No it's not the same bass as I suspected cause the tail is chopped a little but here she is. Such a nice bass     Well that sums up my trip, I got my little bro out fishing and my Dad and uncles. I got to finally run a outboard and well now I want a 14 lumie with a 20 or 30hp  Well see what I do a year from now haha.  Anyway I got reports to applaud and read up on, thanks for viewing and hope the bassin has been good to everybody this summer!  Tightlines   MTBF"

I GOTTA know though....what paint did you use for the boat?  Gotta do some touch ups, and yours look great....would love to know what you used and where you got it.  "

616421,daryl0815,2011-08-28 15:50:00,225,"Looks like an awesome summer man, congrats on all of those beauty bass.  I remember slammin huge bass on tiny topwaters now, I almost forgot how good they can be!!  Nice job on the boat too, mine is only a 14' with a 9.9, I definitely need a HP upgrade, but then I need some numbers on the boat  maybe I will just stick with under 10 haha!"
616442,ehg,2011-08-28 16:46:00,2666,Another great report! Getting largemouth hooked on topwater frogs in pads is tough but a ton of fun when successful like you were. Thanks for post.
