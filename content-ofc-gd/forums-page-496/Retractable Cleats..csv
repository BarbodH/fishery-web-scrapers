Of course she couldn’t touch bottom and was left hanging there until we in the boat could stop laughing long enough to lift her back in. When the thong came out as few years later; I told her she should sue the company, because she invented it that day out on the boat. Every time I think of that day, the song from CCR comes to mind; but instead of Bad Moon A Rising, it’s MAD Moon. Boy was she pissed at me for not helping sooner/faster; but how could I? I was on the floor of the boat laughing so hard I couldn’t stand, let along lift her back in????  Dan."
