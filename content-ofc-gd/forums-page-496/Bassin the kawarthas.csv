We fished all day and managed 4 nice 2lb range smallies and I got the one largemouth of the day.  Here is one of the smallie    And here is My largemouth, it was weighed at 3lb 12oz caught this in the morning of the day.    And here are another of Rick's smallies    We had a good day until the wind picked up and really push us around.  Thanks for viewing, there were lot's of little fish around today, got to test out my new G.Loomis 6'6M Mod Crankbait rod a little, and even caught a couple tiny bass.  MTBF"
