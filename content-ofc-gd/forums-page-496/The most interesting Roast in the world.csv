616482,lew,2011-08-28 18:58:00,12766,"Jeeez Randy, you post that while I'm sitting here having nothing more than a peanut butter cookie for lunch"
616483,crappieperchhunter,2011-08-28 18:58:00,2582,"Just put a Prime Rib in the oven at 200 degrees for 4 hour approx. When the thermometer says 140 it's time to eat. Having roasted sweet potatoes,onions,parsnips and rutabaga done in a lemon cumin brown sugar sauce with it. One of my favs. We have been waiting awhile for a cooler day to have the oven going.  BTW how hot do you have the BBQ going when you do this? And I'm assuming your doing indirect heat. Looks good  Enjoy your supper"
616484,mercman,2011-08-28 18:59:00,7054,Yer such a tease !!!!!
616487,Muskieman,2011-08-28 19:05:00,2472,  Indirect heat @ 300*F I usually do 6lb'ers but this is the biggest I've done yet.

616621,bigbuck,2011-08-29 03:09:00,2449,Nice roast!! A 9lb'er on the barbie is a great way to get a roast beef fix during the summer months. You got me thinking for the long weekend....
617018,GBW,2011-08-30 13:46:00,8460,Hey Randy.  I found this guy walking around asking if I could point him in the direction of your place...  
617078,Headhunter,2011-08-30 15:58:00,5703,"Looks great Randy... a suggestion... Wrap the whole thing in extra thick cut bacon and follow your recipe... because after all, how can you go wrong with bacon!!!? HH"
