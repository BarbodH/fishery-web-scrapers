We got out on the water at 6 and followed the train of boats leaving the harbour. We made our way out to the starting depth and were trolling as the sun peeked over the horizon, just a beautiful start to the day. It wasn't long and the fog closed in on us but we kept our senses tuned, watched the GPS and fired off the air horn with a short blast to let others know of our where abouts and continued our troll.  We thought we were hearing things as we could of swore that a boat was running wide open, couldn't be as you could barely see in front of you. However we were not hearing things. As the sound got louder a cruiser appeared out of the fog and was running towards us. Luckily it was slightly off to our starboard side and missed the planer board by about 15ft. Good thing the  got his boating license, at least I'm assuming he has it.  It seemed to take forever for the fog to lift and for that first fish to come. We had no luck in the ""shallows"" and made our way out to the blue zone. Once there the action picked up. Nothing big boated but we got 3 bows and a shaker coho, one screamer was one for about 2 seconds, a couple others lost and lots of bumps.  A fun day on the water and you couldn't beat the weather. Luckily no one was hurt and we were off the water at 5pm. A long day on the water with a slow bite for us but couldn't think of a better place to send the day. Will try to get out there again and give it another shot hopefully in the next couple of weeks. Didn't take any pics on the water but here's a shot of the one 1 kept for dinner. Gotta love a BBQ trout.   "
616898,irishfield,2011-08-30 02:29:00,26272,Just like 6am on the BOQ in November Will... can't see the bow of the boat while doing 3 mph and someone rips by at full throttle following their gps from the day before!  Ya got food at least...
616919,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-30 03:43:00,10439,"I used to hate those thick fog days. Didn't mind them so much running a couple of friends boats that had radar though. Granted the guy relly shouldn't be running flat out in the fog but it's not dangerous at all with the proper equipment (radar). We wouldn't run full speed but 1/2 throttal no problem (gives you more time to react if something shows up on the radar unexpectedly (log, floating debris of some kind). With good radar you can pick up a floating log over a mile away. Won't be able to pick up a planer board though."
617021,fishnsled,2011-08-30 13:54:00,3520,"  I also like the guys that sit in the channel with the lights off and rigging up their gear while others are trying to head out.    Lots of logs floating around out there, might have been nice to have had radar for that. An expensive option for the 1 or 2 times a year I go out there but if the idiots are around....."
617024,ccmtcanada,2011-08-30 13:58:00,7971,"It's always an adventure isn't it Will???  Just glad no one was hurt, you caught a few fish and had a great day out there.  Next time you need someone to keep the boat straight while you set up lines, just let me know....LOL."
617120,Terry,2011-08-30 18:08:00,14456,it is an adventure ...LOL
617122,jimmer,2011-08-30 18:15:00,2730,"They just don't think anyone else is out on the lake. Selfishness. Glad no one was hurt in either incident, that kind of crash never ends on a good note."
