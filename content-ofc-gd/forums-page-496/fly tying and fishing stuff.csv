But who on earth would buy the whole lot; I guess my question is what or should I do, list it all seperatly and hope that it all  goes or list the entire thing and hope that someone is interested in everything?  Dave"

I'll get a list in the classifieds sometime this week....// Fish_Finder I have 15 years of fly tying materials  a few rods and reels.. I know I will never get what I paid for the stuff which makes it hard to put a price tag on it... who knows maybe I can get enought to get that really nice spinnin combo that is in the classifieds...
