Anyway was out fishing right in front of my dock during hurricane Iriene. My dock sits right at the bottom of a of a lock on the trent system. My daughter came down to the dock to yell across the river that she had wanted to fish with dad. So I up the anchor to go get her..Get her in the boat and back over to drop anchor.. not even 30 seconds into it I hear ""fish on dady"" lol her eit is a nice 17.5 incher! Then its dads turn. a niice 24 incher.  .throw in a ton of SMB and id say we had an awesome day!!!  On another note check out the size of this dragonfly we had visit us on sat night...WOW!!!   Anyway thats all for now...here are some osprey pics I took too...enjoy!    "

616805,mercman,2011-08-29 20:37:00,7054, Girls seem to have a 6th sense when it comes to fish. When i fish with my wife i seldom use my fishfinder cause she finds them faster telepathically i think  Great report!!  Paul
616842,danbouck,2011-08-29 23:26:00,4380,Nice! My boys always seem to catch fish right away too
616845,drewbrew,2011-08-29 23:43:00,31,"Awesome pics TB,Looks like she out fished you again! lol."
616848,tb4me,2011-08-29 23:51:00,3295,As always.. I just love it when she does. Most times I just sit and watch her fish..Makes a dad happy
616852,spincast,2011-08-29 23:59:00,3279,"Hey Ron - great report - looks like the cottage is treating you well .I'm in the same club, daughter or son both seem to show up the old man when we're out together - aint it great!"
616989,johnnyb,2011-08-30 13:00:00,3413,What a great shot of your daughter with that fish....good times!  Can't wait to get mine in the boat with me  
616993,bushart,2011-08-30 13:07:00,2628,Great Times
617001,ccmtcanada,2011-08-30 13:22:00,7971,Loved this report!  Your daughter doesn't mess around when it comes to fishing does she?? LOL.  Excellent pictures...that one of the dragonfly...just noticed the spider looking right at it!!!
617004,Rod Caster,2011-08-30 13:24:00,5784,Two nice walleyes!!  Enjoy the snack
617011,tb4me,2011-08-30 13:36:00,3295,"Actually they both went back to swim another day..We only had one so we let it go..The 24 was out long enough to get a pic then let go too. My daughter wanted to keep hers but we had only 1. I explained to her that if we let it go it would have hundreds of babies, she could teach her kids to catch one day..."
617025,Homer Is King,2011-08-30 13:59:00,305,"Great report and pics! Beauty walleye!  It's humbling fishing with your kids!! You spend hundreds of dollars on gear, days on the internent researching techniques / hotspots / weather patterns / etc, then you go and hours in a boat for a couple of fish. They show up with the $20 bait cast combo, a worm and hook, and smash em!! LOL!! Life's not fair!  My kids are the same. Conservation, it seems, is not a natural instinct. They want to keep everything. We have the ""grow bigger - have babies"" discussion every time we go fishing. Plus, I'm not cleaning a 4"" perch!"
