Took these 2 newbs and all i did that evening is bust my ass to make sure there is no way they could loose their fish! It worked out pretty well, excuse the language, and turn up the volume as we take the piss out of each other while battling big ole silver bullets! The second video includes me getting hit in the head with a magnum dipsey while netting a high 20's Nook. Enjoy!  23lbs+  http://s156.photobucket.com/albums/t9/jfps6/?action=view&current=VID00023-20110715-2023.mp4  27lbs+  http://s156.photobucket.com/albums/t9/jfps6/?action=view&current=VID00022-20110715-1917.mp4  Jason Out!"
