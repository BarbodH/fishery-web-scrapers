616525,mike rousseau,2011-08-28 21:26:00,4661,You have those footballs dialed in... Your arms must feel like they're gunna fall off...
616526,Jigs,2011-08-28 21:27:00,136,Really cool shots. I like the use of the extension on the very first pic. Looks awesome. It kind of looks like you're using the GoPro because of the wide angle lens but the quality is really good. Better than what you'd get with the GoPro so I kind of doubt that's the camera.  Were you pre-fishing for the Renegade Classic by any chance? That water looks mighty familiar and I saw a bunch of bass guys out yesterday.
616656,Lungelarry,2011-08-29 11:38:00,294,"Thanks guys,its just another thing to do to keep fish interesting. JIGS....no I don,t fish Renegade,but the St. Larry around Mtl. is very similiar to franny."
