616284,pics,2011-08-27 22:49:00,1268,There's a ramp there somewhere...the cottages all have motorboats....stop and ask. lots of friendly people around.
616314,Rizzo,2011-08-28 01:05:00,4754," Where our cottage is up near Parry Sound we all have boats, but there is no public area to launch. We all do it right off out own shoreline. For me I'm limited to a tinny with a 9.9, but the people on either side of me manage to launch ""proper"" boats from their own shore"
616407,johnnyb,2011-08-28 15:13:00,3413,"I'd just hand-bomb it in from Monck Road....then scoot up and park at the Head Lake beach/launch parking lot.  Or....if the culvert's passable, launch on Head then squeeze through into Rush"
616541,Rizzo,2011-08-28 22:36:00,4754,That's what I was wondering...is the culvert possible or is there some other way to get a 16 footer in there (hand bombing not possible). Guess I'll just have to go check it out some day or do like pics suggested and talk to the locals
616542,irishfield,2011-08-28 22:43:00,26272,I google earthed it as best I could Roger and don't see anything definite at a road end..
616562,Rizzo,2011-08-29 00:28:00,4754,"thanks Wayne, I tried that too but couldn't see any good access points. I enjoy trying out ""somewhat"" difficult to access lakes...but not so difficult I need to use a canoe or innertube!"
616652,turtle,2011-08-29 11:10:00,274,"I spent some time at that lake but it was 25 years ago.  There was no public boat launch at that time, I launched off the cottage front lawn, it was flat all around the lake.  I recall a creek entering the lake at the north end where the highway is, and being in a kayak so its probably small and shallow. I fished it alot, its basically a flooded river bed, shallow, weedy with LM bass, smallish muskie and panfish."
