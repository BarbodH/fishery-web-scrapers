The last time down there we stayed at Merland Park but the weather did not exactly comply and our 16 ft. boat bounced around like a cork. Turned quite religious because of that experience  This time we are planning for Hay Bay or Telegraph Hill or ? as we feel rough water will not be such a issue. We are looking for a place to launch/moor our boat and a cabin,lodge,motel etc. Any advise on would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance glenn"
