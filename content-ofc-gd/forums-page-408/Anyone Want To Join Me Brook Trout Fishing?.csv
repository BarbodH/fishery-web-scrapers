696311,chris.brock,2012-05-14 23:39:00,4053,"I don't know how you do it Solo, you don't seem to sit still for too long, I'm looking forward to the trip report when you get back. Pretty dicey adding a partner you likely won't have met before, trips like that you will be pretty well attached at the hip for 4 days or so."
696312,irishfield,2012-05-14 23:40:00,26272, ... and I just leave my wife a note when I do so !!
696314,davey buoy,2012-05-14 23:40:00,5505, Those cold nights can be a bugger:rofl2::rofl2:
696342,danc,2012-05-15 00:25:00,4677,"Sounds like fun for the right person Mike. I could probably hook up with you in a 3 hour drive or so (and no gas shared), but I have my own plans this weekend at a lake ""that is teeming with gigantic wild brookies"" in half that drive from home and a 10 foot walk in. The moon phases, which have been so, so helpful in my Brook Trout fishing,  are almost perfect for us. Saturday and Sunday, new moon, good fishing, Monday best fishing. It sounds like we're both gonna miss the Monday though. I might even ditch the Brookies and fish Steelhead on Sunday. There's a cold water river nearby that will be loaded with them and chances are I won't see another soul all day.  Have fun and good luck Mike. I hope you have an awsome adventure."
696346,solopaddler,2012-05-15 00:41:00,8605," Not a problem Doug. I'd like to speak with directly before you go.    Chris, my wife, although she knows my capabalities, is leery about me doing this trip by myself.  I'm just trying to appease her. The way I figure it anyone who might be up for a trip like this is someone I'd probably get along just fine with.  Anyhow at this point it'll probably be a solo trip as no one's expressed any interest.    I sure am envious of where you live Dan. Walking 10' into a brookie lake has an attractive ring to it.  You have yourself a great trip too."
696351,chris.brock,2012-05-15 00:53:00,4053,"yeah, that makes sense, uncharted territory trips can sometimes be tough, a partner can help I have a SPOT satellite messenger thing for a safety net, it got us out of a jam once too"
696364,solopaddler,2012-05-15 01:57:00,8605,"Well, the position has officially been filled.  Even better it's my buddy Jason who lives up in Manitouwadge now.  What really made my night, Jason has a 4 man tent that weighs 4lb's. I was going to sleep in an ultralight hammock so this is a huge and unexpected bonus!   It will be an epic trip, can't wait."
696366,SirCranksalot,2012-05-15 01:58:00,3291,"Want to? For sure! Can---like the rest, afraid not. There lots of interest, Mike. Availability is what's missing.  Have fun, be safe, catch lots!  Sheesh, man, do you hafta rub it in!!"
696367,Basskicker,2012-05-15 02:00:00,421,"I can't wait to sludge our way through 12km of wilderness terrain for some massive brookies, I'll be there waiting for you!!! lol  Going to be an awesome trip.  Jason"
696374,Moosebunk,2012-05-15 02:07:00,3970,"I read the title and thought... ""only you Mikey."" lol.  What a question to pop.  BUT...  Way to step up Jay.  That's wicked!!!  Good luck guys."
696377,Musky or Specks,2012-05-15 02:13:00,2710,Awesome Mike Glad you found someone I expect an epic report.
696398,solopaddler,2012-05-15 02:54:00,8605,"Thanks guys, I'm stoked."
696210,solopaddler,2012-05-14 17:13:00,8605,"Well due to some serious unforseen issues my tripping partner will not be able to make it on our trip leaving tomorrow.  I'm throwing this out there on the off chance someone is game to join.  I'm leaving tomorrow night around 8pm from Hamilton and am driving almost 10 hours north.  This trip isn't your normal canoe trip. I'm packing 12km's into a destination lake, which btw is teeming with gigantic wild brookies.  I'm packing super ultralight, totally minimalist including packing in and using a float tube as opposed to a canoe.  I have almost everything anyone might need for this trip including another float tube which I can borrow.  Also have an extra pack and enough food/drink for two.  If anyone is up for the challenge you'd need a lightweight sleeping bag, a small amount of clothing and be willing to split the cost of the gas with me.  I'll be returning next Sunday evening on the 20th.  I know this is ridiculously short notice, but shoot me a pm if you're interested and we'll talk directly.  If no one steps up to the plate I'll head in solo which isn't so bad anyway.   Cheers,  Mike"
696211,Musky or Specks,2012-05-14 17:17:00,2710,This is a hardcore trip with fantastic rewards I hope someone takes Mike up on it. Not only big brookies but Trippin with the Solo
696213,solopaddler,2012-05-14 17:19:00,8605,"  Thanks Brad, I'm dyin' here."

696220,torco,2012-05-14 17:31:00,656,Good luck. If only I could join you but I would surely have to find a new job though when I got back
696239,johnnyb,2012-05-14 19:11:00,3413,"Would love to join you Mike...but yeah....would have to find a new job, new wife, and new fishing buddies when I got back.  Hittin' one of my fave backlakes in Temagami for the long weekend.  I even have a float tube!  Good luck dude   PS>  Don't forget at least one roll of tape this time, ok?"
696243,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-14 19:47:00,10439,I could phone in sick if you want to pay the plane fare Mike.
696247,camillj,2012-05-14 20:11:00,1988,Wow ... sounds spectacular .. unfortunately it conflicts with my own Speck trip .. into a little camp in the laurentians in Quebec (hope someone worthy takes you up on your offer - have a great trip either way !
696248,Jds63,2012-05-14 20:11:00,1365,fishing for favorite species  - check doing what i love - check fishing with a legend   - check  getting off work - no chance  do you take rainchecks  ?
696260,Gregoire,2012-05-14 21:00:00,1397,A very nice offer and hopefully someone with a flexible work schedule takes you up on it.
696263,solopaddler,2012-05-14 21:06:00,8605,"Thanks guys.  I'll be shocked if anyone can pull it off on such short notice anyhow, and for sure there's always a next time.      Sure OK, then I'll phone 911 when you collapse halfway in.  (sorry buddy   )"
696266,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-14 21:15:00,10439,  SWEET!!! You can use my phone!!!!!   :good:
696267,misfish,2012-05-14 21:21:00,29133,"No go for me,but what a great offer Mike. This fall,you and I have a date,hell maybe even two."
696272,mirogak,2012-05-14 21:33:00,387,Man ! only if I didn't have to be in the capital for a couple of important prezis. I would and could have taken the rest of the week off.  I am new to this backcountry thing but would have accepted the challenge for them brookies.  Have fun Mike. Miro
696279,Live2fish85,2012-05-14 21:46:00,1633,I wish my heart wasn't messed. That portaging would be alot though.
696281,Live2fish85,2012-05-14 21:46:00,1633,I wish my heart wasn't messed. That portaging would be alot though.
696283,bigugli,2012-05-14 21:49:00,6138,"Yeah, but the coronary would almost be worth it"
696295,solopaddler,2012-05-14 22:10:00,8605," I'd have to haul your carcass out of the bush, there's no cel service up there.    Been saying that for a while now.    I was thinking about calling you today buddy."
696300,Jigger,2012-05-14 22:43:00,1237,"When in doubt, call highdrifter..."
696302,Skud,2012-05-14 22:53:00,739,"You're crazy Dude. And just think, you are only a ""ghost of your former self"" when it comes to time spent fishing. I could almost go except for the fact that I am going up to Nakina for a week at the end of the month. Thanks for lining me up for that by the way."
696304,adempsey,2012-05-14 23:02:00,1498,"That's unfortunate.  Hopefully you find someone to replace your partner and I hope that they are OK.  I wish it could be me because the trip you planned sounds pretty amazing.   Maybe I'll just leave my wife a note?  That could end well, no?"
696305,irishfield,2012-05-14 23:09:00,26272, Hell.. you only live once!! Give it a whirl....
