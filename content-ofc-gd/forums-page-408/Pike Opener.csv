695741,PickerelHunter,2012-05-13 02:51:00,100,"It feels like I waited forever for today to come...hours of research, sleepless nights in anticipation, day dreaming of success...pike opener was finally upon us.  Alarm clock rang at 4:45...hit snooze till 5:15...didn't think I was going to make it out of bed.  Finally a little voice in my head said 'man up and get your a$$ out of bed'.  Done, up and packed, out of the driveway by 5:30.  Quick Tim's run on the way and I'm at my buddies who has gotten the boat set and ready to go.  On the 400 by 5:45 with the feeling of excitement I used to get on Christmas morning.  This was going to be our first pike opener on a boat, and our first time fishing cooks bay... (soft water).  6:15 we're launched and on the water...I had a rough gameplan in mind...5-10 feet and some weeds...but once you get out there it's much easier visualized than in reality. Our excitement turns to despair as we looked at this massive body of water and wondered where the heck to start.  We headed south...stopped the boat in about 7 feet of water...and decided to try there.  No real reason for it, just wanted to get the line in the water more than anything.  We had said on the ride down the lake that we would be happy with one nice pike in the boat, but due to our inexperience on the lake and no real 'spots' that we knew of, we were more hopeful than anything.  What followed for the next 3 hours was the best pike fishing, pound for pound, that I have ever experienced.  I fish pike often.  I've caught some big ones, I've had multiple 20 fish days in the Gogama area...but nothing like this in terms of consistency and size.  We ended up boating 15 fish in those three hours (1 was a nice 3-4 lb largie).  And all were a good size!!  I'm used to catching 24-28 inch pike all day long in Gogama...our smallest of the day was in that range!  Honestly...it was amazing.  Enough with the words...on to the  Variety of lures were used...spinners, spoons and x-raps. Most were caught in that 7 foot range and not too far from our starting point.  Here's the smallest one of the day     Here's a few of the beauties from the morning          "

695765,Skud,2012-05-13 04:48:00,739,That is some pretty good action being that shallow after the ice has been gone for so long. Don't go back in the summer and expect the same results. Lady Simcoe can humble you fast. Thanks for the report.
