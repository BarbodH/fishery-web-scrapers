695945,mistaredone,2012-05-13 22:21:00,913,My niece just netted a lamprey in the credit river. Not sure if the are native or not?  Kill or release?
695946,chessy,2012-05-13 22:26:00,610,kill
695948,mike rousseau,2012-05-13 22:28:00,4661,when i put lampreys back in the water... im pretty sure they arent going to survive...
695958,dave524,2012-05-13 22:56:00,4508,"there are quite a few species of non parasitic lamprey, where in the Credit was it?, if it was in the headwaters woulld probably one of them."
695974,Joeytier,2012-05-13 23:51:00,3990,I've seen many native lampreys in the headwaters of Lake O. rivers...Do not assume that it was an invasive sea lamprey.
695975,Dave Bailey,2012-05-13 23:52:00,1641,"From Ontario Streams     Apparently some are protected, so make certain of what you have before killing any."
696035,mistaredone,2012-05-14 01:59:00,913,"The lamprey was just north of King road, terra cotta area. It was only 6"" long so I wasn't sure if it was a juvenile or a native species I had never heard of."
696046,danjang,2012-05-14 02:23:00,148,It was definitely a native species. An American Brook Lamprey.  Make sure you ID positively before you kill anything! Harvesting an Atlantic thinking it's a rainbow is just as bad as killing a native lamprey thinking it's a sea lamprey!
696194,Jon,2012-05-14 16:17:00,209,"Most likely a native, non-parasitic American Brook Lamprey, however, Sea Lamprey were reported upstream of Norval last year. Very tough to tell the juveniles apart but if you catch one over 10"" it is a sea lamprey.  Jon"
696240,manitoubass2,2012-05-14 19:13:00,11391," I had caught one on Rainy River last year that I though was a sea lamprey, it was about 12"". I called the MNR and they asked me to preserve it so they could identify it. Turn out it wasn't a sea lamprey and was indeed native.  The size is an indication maybe, but not a sure fire way to identify the species.   "
696301,danjang,2012-05-14 22:45:00,148," The sea lamprey is the only lamprey with 2 separated dorsal fins. 3 of them have 1 dorsal and the American brook lamprey can be tricky, it has a small membrane attaching the two.    Curious, adults that hitch hiked or evidence of successful spawning?"
696390,danc,2012-05-15 02:38:00,4677,These are the ones that I come across most often.    But I can find these guys in late May/ early June as well during their spawning ritual. Nasty critters.  
696403,Dave Bailey,2012-05-15 02:58:00,1641,"Some species are considered a delicacy, to the point where nobles could be sanctioned for not turning enough over to the king. And, just to look like the pseudointellectual that I strive to be; they are NOT eels as many think. Not closely related at all, being vertebrates is about as close as it gets."
696531,Jon,2012-05-15 16:16:00,209,"I should have been more specific about using size. I think it is ok in this case for two reasons. First of all, the Credit only has two lamprey species - Sea Lamprey and American Brook Lamprey. American Brook Lamprey don't get bigger than 8 or 9 inches so anything larger would be a Sea Lamprey. Secondly, identifying lamprey correctly takes a fair amount of experience and is not something that I think most people could do. The key in Freshwater Fishes of Canada uses some pretty complicated things to id these guys so in this case, size is a pretty simple thing for people to understand.  If this was further north or on the west coast where there are other species, size would not be appropriate.  As far as their presence upstream of Norval goes, they either got past the Norval dam on their own or they hitched a ride. I know one adult Sea Lamprey was captured yesterday just upstream of Old Derry Road.  Jon"
696559,SirCranksalot,2012-05-15 18:41:00,3291," I heard on the radio that Ont is sending a whole bunch to England for a special feast for the queen's jubilee! I suppose the English are not that famous for their fine cuisine!. The guy on radio said they could have lots more if they wanted them!  I know we are all supposed to be conservation minded here, but this is a case where I'd kill first and ask questions later."
