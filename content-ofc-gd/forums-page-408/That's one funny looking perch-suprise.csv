I heard rumors of specs in this lake.... rumor confirmed      Note to self, point camera away from sun.  "

695529,Rod Caster,2012-05-12 13:42:00,5784,"  Ha, funny you say that. Countless times I've accidentally grabbed her shades."
695541,kickingfrog,2012-05-12 14:18:00,8333, Not buying it.  Nice fish. Keep that little gem real quiet.
695579,mike rousseau,2012-05-12 16:23:00,4661,Very cool...  Your lucky to have so many lakes close by to mix things up a bit...
695608,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-12 18:24:00,535,"  Says the guy that lives right by the St. Lawrence......     That's awesome, it's always great to catch a surprise. Especially when it's as tasty as trout!"
695611,mike rousseau,2012-05-12 19:12:00,4661,  I get sick of current sometimes....
695612,Joeytier,2012-05-12 19:47:00,3990,That's about the best surprise catch I could think of.  Usually it's the other way around...

695747,gino,2012-05-13 02:59:00,400,It's always good when you get some new species in a certain lake...Looks like a good day for you too...
695750,manitoubass2,2012-05-13 03:05:00,11391," Come on man! It's awesome when you establish the pattern and have everything fire on all cylinders, then the next cast the current totally changes everything, lol.  I hear ya bro.  Awesome surprise RC!!!!!! Thanks for the Repor   "
695758,EC1,2012-05-13 04:02:00,930,Sweet! Accidentally stumbling onto fish is one of the best feelings while fishing!
695865,Leecher,2012-05-13 17:37:00,7832,Get your own shades eh    I'd take that type of surprise any day   Beauty speck Chad  You look like you've landed from the heavens in that last pic
695867,Rod Caster,2012-05-13 17:41:00,5784,  That was the angel guiding me to the speckled trout.
696154,fishnsled,2012-05-14 14:27:00,3520,Great surprise! Canoe looks like working very well for you too.
696324,MJL,2012-05-14 23:56:00,2427,Hard to be disappointed when a surprise like that happens  . I definitely have to try fishing some of the lakes and streams up your way for brookies.
