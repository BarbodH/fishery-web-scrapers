696503,Headhunter,2012-05-15 14:33:00,5703,"Huge loss for the bass playing as well as musical community. The man was a legend and influenced so many players... at least he died doing what he loved... just finished playing two shows in Japan and passed away. RIP Duck! Here's a link to the Duck... he's the dude with the pipe, for those that don't know... laying down the groove the John and Dan!  HH"
