694973,mercman,2012-05-10 19:11:00,7054,  People seem to lose those big ones alot. I fished up 2 or 3 on the river here last year. Black and orange with black blades seem to be the easiest to lose.
694977,mercman,2012-05-10 19:16:00,7054,  I'm trying hard to integrate my special personality into the forum
694979,misfish,2012-05-10 19:21:00,29133,  Dont kid yourself Paul. He knows his stuff.   Heres another you shouldnt over look aswell.  Buzzbaits. Great for active smallies and largies.  
694984,mercman,2012-05-10 19:37:00,7054, Nice I'm guessing you fish them the same way?They would be killer just at the surface.
694991,misfish,2012-05-10 19:45:00,29133,Thats what their for. Top water buzz baits.
694994,davey buoy,2012-05-10 19:48:00,5505,Nothing like bringing it out of the lily pads and see it hit by a nice bass. Big splash =Awesome.
694997,mercman,2012-05-10 19:51:00,7054,"  Man !! Am i a fart smeller or what.  This is great info.I am really excited to get mine wet, and try some of the ideas in this thread."

695143,manitoubass2,2012-05-11 02:55:00,11391,"It's pretty funny that musky on spinnerbaits was brought up today. I went shore fishing with my kids for the fourth day in a row, still casting that black/silver tandem pot belly, and I caught my fourth rainy river musky! Just a baby, but man o man was it a gorgeous colored fish. Only got 4 bass today, so that musky really made my day"
695196,mercman,2012-05-11 13:01:00,7054, That Musky is probably why you only caught 4 Bass
695199,lew,2012-05-11 13:09:00,12766,"Anyone who's not using spinnerbaits (BIG) for musky is missing out on alot of very nice fish. I ALWAYS have a very large black/orange bait on one rod and it's ALWAYS the 1st bait I start tossing EVERY day and it's often the same bait I'm still throwing at the end of the day.  I couldn't begin to know how many muskies I've caught with them when nothing else in the boat would even get a sniff from a fish.  If your not using them, give em a try and you'll be very happy you did."
695219,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-11 13:53:00,535,  I have a few of them but have only used them a few times. Do you put a soft plastic on it too?
695265,lew,2012-05-11 15:46:00,12766," Yeah, I normally put 2 plastic worms on them and usually about 7"" long for each of them. I swap out the bottom single for a 7/0 treble and add an orange worm then add another to the single hook on top.  This is an older pic but shows the difference in size compared to a bass bait.  Not sure where the bottom worm is in this picture  but it looks like it's folded up under the bait.  "
695279,Raf,2012-05-11 16:33:00,3495," I waiting for Lew to chime in.  If you fish lakes with thick heavy slop [ie Kawarthas] I would think spinnerbaits would work great.  They are relatively weedless, you can work em fast, work em slow... etc.  I don't typically fish places with really heavy weeds or really shallow and prefer to use inlines but if/when I do they get the nod."
695283,Squid,2012-05-11 16:40:00,1656,What!! no one mentions Slop masters as the go to bait
695286,mike rousseau,2012-05-11 16:41:00,4661,That's kinda why I don't use em... Almost all the weedbeds on the st.lawrence are flatened out by current... Almost no standing weeds... So they have no advantage over other baits... From a design perspective...
695456,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-12 06:52:00,535," That looks awesome, thanks! Definetely gotta give it a try more this year, especially with all the weeds in the waters I fish."

694772,Dan668,2012-05-10 03:01:00,1120,I catch lots of musky and big walleye while fishing for bass in the kawarthas. Even pan fish on a 1/2oz
694798,Gregoire,2012-05-10 10:43:00,1397," That is surprising to me. Large bucktails have been a good musky bait for me. Not sure how much the colour matters, but the profile and vibration seem to trigger strikes."
694799,mercman,2012-05-10 11:02:00,7054," I have a mind to sell all my other lures,and buy more SB, and have fun experimenting with them.I bet with the right presentation,you could catch anything that swims, on a SB."

694827,dave524,2012-05-10 12:20:00,4508," Another oldtime jig and spinner combo, that has produced when a little flash helps is the Blakemore Road Runner. A crappie lure par excellance in the white maribou and great for walleye in the larger sizes."
694828,fish_fishburn,2012-05-10 12:22:00,1311,When the bite is slow for smallies I always go to a beetle spin with a small grub. Have won tournies when the bite was off and the weights were dismall. Then the question of the day is what were you using I threw everything in my box at em all day.

694836,doubleheader,2012-05-10 13:07:00,497,"Mercman, as you so correctly highlited, the knowledge so willingly shared on this site is invaluable. You're getting honest opinions/tips from fishermen with no commercial interest or specifc product to promote, fishing the same geographical area you fish. I would humbly add just the fact that the classification ""spinner baits"" is a broad one, and that spinner baits yield the best results when tailored to species, time of year, body of water, and current conditions. Also, certain designs are better suited for ceratin types of presentations. All these things together is why many fisherman elect to build their own, whether it be a simple walleye harness on line of choice or a double cowgirl on a wireform. First, it's rather inexpensive to get into (even wire form tools are rather inexpensive), 2nd you can build them cheaper than you can buy them, and 3rd, you'll have the ability to experiment with designs and talor designs based on results. Good luck."
694839,mercman,2012-05-10 13:21:00,7054,Thanks DH I have been looking at buying some kits from LureMaking.com.  These beetle spinners everyone is talking about.Are they what we used to call June Bug Spinners?A 6''long s/s rigid wire with a June Bug like spinner and a few red beads on it? I remember them as being deadly on Bass and Pike.
694845,manitoubass2,2012-05-10 13:41:00,11391," The ""Beetle spins"" I'm talking about Paul are a little different then that. I'm not too sure about others though. I'll take a quick pic of one my sons used yesterday with a Kalins Bluegill grub.  I think there also referred to as ""close pin spinners""? Something like that anyhow.     "
694856,manitoubass2,2012-05-10 14:01:00,11391,"I def. tie all my own harnesses, way way better then pre made IMO. And once you use quick change clevises you'll never go back.  Paul, I forgot my boy got snagged up and lost the bait I was going to post a pic of. It was the same grub/beetlespin but it was attached to a black round head jig.  For the sake of the pic, I rigged it onto a Strike King Bitsy jig(which also happens to be a deadly combo)  On this jig (or my sons rig) you can fish 2FOW on one cast, 20FOW on the next cast, super versatile lure."
694858,doubleheader,2012-05-10 14:11:00,497," I believe so. I remember one time when i was young and derparately trying to catch more than catching walleyes, I was at Lakair Lodge and this fella in a tiny little tin boat was backtrolling June Bug spinners tipped with pork rine (probably so the perch couldn't clean him every 5 seconds) with wire line to get it on the bottom, every day I'd hang at the fish house just  to be amazed at the size of walleyes he was bringing in. He must have got a kick out of me, standing there, too dumbfounded to even speak, just jones'n those big eyes. Yeah Luremaking.com is a place as well as Mudhole."
694860,bigmac1984,2012-05-10 14:25:00,193,"X2 for luremaking.com  I got all my stuff there, they are great people to deal with. The fact that you can customize colours and blade sizes etc. is fun. I poured myself 20 new spinnerbait heads last night that are now waiting for me to put my own colours and combos on it. Its definately a good way to kill the winter blues away (although it is spring now!)"

694915,goteeboy,2012-05-10 16:55:00,175, I just got a bunch after they went on sale at tackle warehouse late last year for around 8 dollars each.  can't wait to try them.

694378,eman,2012-05-08 22:46:00,101,"They are awesome for pike (big n small). I have had medium success for bass but that's probably because I use top waters as a search bait or bass are active. Also, think weeds, you can usually pull spinners through pretty thick weeds. I always use a 3 inch grub single or double tail for extra action and trailer hooks get added for short strikes."

I tried with a 4"" Berkley minnow on it, caught about five or so, then the minnow was wrecked, so I just kept fishing without it. Adding the bait didn't hurt, but it didn't make things any better either, at least not today."

694496,DaveMc,2012-05-09 11:47:00,89,"i love tossing spinnerbaits when i can. a few years ago me and a buddy got on some fall largemouth in a spinnerbait bite, going 60 - 100 per day. it got really expensive with terminator and strikeking baits when we would get 5-6 per bait. then we stumbled across CL Fishin (actually a member here) i now only use their Pro Willow Series baits, strongest i have fished yet and reasonably priced for a higher end spinnerbait. My favorite for pike is the Holo Chartreuse White Monster, and bass would be the Sexy Shad Silver. I like to use plated blades when the sun is out and painted when its overcast, its just always worked for me. http://www.clfishin.com/online-shop/spinnerbait/cl-pro-willow-series/"
694512,dave524,2012-05-09 12:55:00,4508, Aren't they all just advancements and mods of the original beetle spin of the 60's.
694528,Jigger,2012-05-09 13:17:00,1237,"1/2oz most of the time, smallies gobble em up like candy. I broke too many expensive ones, so i fish Booyah. Cheap enough to replace, plus, i like the vibration it gives off. 14lb mono all day and night."
694548,super dave,2012-05-09 14:27:00,323,"Not sure if this was mentioned already but carry some extra skirts.  Pike chew them up and even largies can do some damage to them with their sandpaper teeth.  As for weight, depends on how I want to present.  If the weeds are right to the top, I prefer 1/4.  that way I can still slow roll the spinnerbait and have it ride above the weeds.  willow blade helps as well for shallower presentation.  For distance and depth and fast retrieve, I like the 3/8, 1/2 and heavier."

694569,manitoubass2,2012-05-09 15:42:00,11391," I totally agree, tons of great info here!  And for the wallies, doesn't surprise me. Most people just don't use them for wallies, plain and simple. And thats fine by me! lol  What color you plan on using for pike??? I already mentioned my two favorites, but if I'm pike fishing it's gotta be white on white, with silver willows   "
694571,mercman,2012-05-09 15:48:00,7054, Beetles spins.  Man i remember fishing with those as a kid.We would catch anything on those with a big hunk of worm on the hook. Do they still make them?
694572,manitoubass2,2012-05-09 15:50:00,11391," I don't know about the originals, but I use the Northland Tackle ones for walleye and other pan fish. They can work really well at times on a jig head with a grub, especially for post spawn."
694578,manitoubass2,2012-05-09 16:20:00,11391,"and Paul,  I've also used the beetle spins on skirted bass jigs. That way you can downsize the offering when needed, while still creating flash and vibration"
694582,mercman,2012-05-09 16:30:00,7054,"This is cool I can remember fishing with dad.Sometimes we would not be getting hits, and he would throw me a beetle spin or a chunk of plastic worm''Try adding This to your bait''  and we would hammer them for the rest of the day. I guess all it takes is to have the presence of mind, to try something even if it looks strange to you."
694595,soobnoob,2012-05-09 17:08:00,55,  white all the way for pike what colour do you use for wallies?  I'll be on canal if any of you are goin out this weekend
694602,manitoubass2,2012-05-09 17:18:00,11391, Black and silver if shiners are present. Chartreusse and silver blades when vis. isn't great or your fishing 20FOW+
694644,Weeds,2012-05-09 20:00:00,782,"I love throwing spinnerbaits as much as the next guy but if you happen to be fishing in an area where Bass see a high amount of fishing pressure they might not be my first choice. I can go down to river here in town (once season opens) and catch Smallies one after another on a Senko but chucking a spinnerbait you might go an hour without so much as a sniff. Mind you that never stops me from throwing them, I love em for musky; makes for a nice easy release too with the single hook."
694731,mercman,2012-05-10 01:15:00,7054,"Well this has been a real treat. My confidence in these lure has sky rocketed. I plan on fishing them this weekend and during the week for Pike.I also plan on picking up some different colors too. Most of what i have are lighter colors like white/white. white/chartreuse. white/orange, with gold or silver willows.  Thanks to all who contributed"
694736,mike rousseau,2012-05-10 01:25:00,4661,White for bass... Chartrues/green for pike...  One gold and one silver tandem willows on any color SB...
694740,SirCranksalot,2012-05-10 01:34:00,3291, I wonder if it's just the male fish that chase the skirts.
694063,mercman,2012-05-08 01:17:00,7054,"I have recently gotten interested in Spinner Baits. They seem to be a very versatile lure that can be used to catch a number of species of the fish i target. I have a 7foot medium light rod with a 6.4:1 baitcaster that i will be using. Is braid an acceptable line when using a spinnerbait? What are some of the technics that i should be useing, or is it just cast and burn the retrieve? Can i add a piece of worm or a tube to the hook? Teach me oh wise Spinner Baiters What are some of your most successful techniques?   Thanks  Paul"
694065,Mike the Pike,2012-05-08 01:19:00,3421,are you kidding me man.You have never used spinner baits.Really?  Your success rate is now going to increase my friend.  Pike and Bass love them.  
694069,Rizzo,2012-05-08 01:24:00,4754,"Most versatile lure out there...about time you started! At my cottage I actually refuse to use them because it gets too easy to catch pike...need a bit of a challenge. Long story short, pretty hard to fish them wrong. Burn the surface? part way down? jig it back in? and I have even caught a bunch of pike just leaving it laying on bottom! No word of a lie, I have caught several pike leaving a spinnerbait dead on bottom for a few minutes."
694072,mike rousseau,2012-05-08 01:29:00,4661,cant fish em wrong paul...  one thing i like to do is to add a large single stinger hook onto the regular hook... for the days when they are nipping at the bait...  then its a mood thing... if they are really aggressive then burn em fast... if not... slow it down a bit and get the lure down to the strike zone..  as far as trailers go... keep em short... there ok for bulking up a bait a bit... but if you hang a 10 inch worm off the back your gunna get short stikes...3-4 inch twister tails work good for trailers..
694074,Nipfisher,2012-05-08 01:31:00,2449,I have also never used one for more than a few casts. Never needed to as the pike and bass are usually willing to cooperate on Rapalas and crank-baits.
694077,mike rousseau,2012-05-08 01:34:00,4661,also good for trolling...
694079,Dan668,2012-05-08 01:35:00,1120,Anyone ever try komanchi spinnerbaits? I want to try them. 18 bucks a piece is stopping me lol
694081,KShea,2012-05-08 01:42:00,18,If you want a slower presentation go with the Colorado blades ( the rounded ones ) if a quicker presentation use the willows. I like using Colorado with a dark skirt for pike around thus time of year on my lake they just eat'em up ( pardon the pun )  also Mike makes a good point about the stinger hook very good idea. They are for the most part pretty easy to use though there are so many ways to work them it can take awhile to mastern them all lol. Good luck in your new venture though fir some reason i don't think you'll need it.
694093,mercman,2012-05-08 02:01:00,7054,"Great I picked up about a dozen of the in various weights and colors at Sail last week.Terminators. They were on special during the no tax sale. I have seen them in action,just never had a reason to use them before. Now i want to try something new to me."
694105,bigmac1984,2012-05-08 02:17:00,193,"Where to begin with this one....  As many have said, a spinnerbait is a great ""search"" bait to find the active bass. Can't really fish them wrong, chuck and wind, chuck and wind. Trailer hooks are a must, alot of times without them you'll miss the smallies. I don't add a twister tail or anything to mine but I do use the Strike King Perfect Skirts with Magic tails which pretty much already give the bait that same look, but those skirts are my personal preference (I make spinnerbaits myself for fun).  You can do a few things when you are retrieving the bait to increase your odds of a strike. As soon as the bait hits the water, give the rod a quick jerk to get the blades spinning, and periodically during the retrieve, do the same thing. This will make the blades flash which can entice a strike, as well as make the skirt pulsate and give off a vibration at the same time. Quick flash + vibrating skirt = injured baitfish. With smallies, the further you can bomb the bait, the better it seems to be. Since they are notorious sight feeders, the further away from the boat you can be the better. Most of my spinnerbait strikes come within the first 3 or 4 turns of the reel.  Secondly, smallies notoriously will follow a bait all the way to the boat and frustrate the hell out of you, so I always have a tube or drop shot rig right beside me and if I see a follower, I drop that in the water right away. If you don't have multi-rig setups, then next time try a faster or slower retrieve to see why that bass didn't strike the bait. Chances are, it'll follow it 2 or 3 times, and eventually it'll hit if you present it correctly.  Blades make a difference too I find. Silver blades give the most flash on clear days, while the gold blades seem to work better on overcast days. I usually use only silver willowleaf blades when smallie fishing, and go to the bigger colorado blades when largemouth fishing. They seem to like the thumping and the flash that the gold blades give off. As far as the actual spinnerbait colour, white, white, white for smallies. Largies seem to hit more colours, but I find the firetiger or bluegill colours work the best.  Lastly, and again I think this will be personal preference, but I use a MH baitcasting rod, extra fast action, with 50lb braid. When those smallies hit a spinnerbait, they will absolutely smash it and cripple your spinnerbait. Most spinnerbaits will have a 3/0 of 4/0 hook that will require good backbone to set the hook, but enough flexibility to keep the fish hooked.  I could go on and on about spinnerbaits as it is one of my favourite techniques, I don't go on the water anywhere without a spinnerbait tied on.  Hope this helps along with the great advice I'm sure many people will give you."

694118,manitoubass2,2012-05-08 02:42:00,11391,"If your on a school of walleye and you want to catch the biggest ones in the school, tie on a spinner bait. Let it sink to the bottom the slow roll it or jig it back to the boat.  Bass and pike will hammer these baits, just gotta try different retrieves etc to see what they want.  Braid works fine, actually I prefer to use braid for the sensitivity.  Two colors I love, chart with silver tandem blades, and black with tandem silver blade.  My preferred size is 3/8oz.  I only use Strike King Pot Bellies. All of them will work, but these are the ones I like the best.  "
694133,manitoubass2,2012-05-08 03:49:00,11391,"  Yeppers, good point Sinclair!   I tried Terminator spinners last year and two of them broke right away, I wasn't too impressed. Strike King makes the best IMO   "
694151,Billy Bob,2012-05-08 10:12:00,5865,You can also use them when fishing under low hanging branches......great bait for catching squirrels.....
694155,singingdog,2012-05-08 10:28:00,1047,"Lots of good advice. A couple of things I would add....  For smallies, don't be afraid of painted blades. My best smallie sbait has white/chart painted blades and almost always has a swimsenko trailer.  Fish sbaits like jigs: pitching into holes in weed beds can be deadly.  Don't be afraid to try them in open water, no cover to be seen. A big, bright sbait over 20' of water will get smallies to hit when nothing else will.  Hit wood....alot."
694222,spinnerbaitking,2012-05-08 14:11:00,1622,"MH action is needed without a doubt or you will loose fish, try colour you like in other lures you will be surprised at all the colours they will hit, when I started on these forums I likely had 250+ spinnerbaits & will have not far off that many now, I agree with the White blades, Booyah's, KVD, Strike King , Piccasso, Pulsators by Norman & Black Fly Lures made in Acton Ontario & try his Purple & Orange lol it really works, not real expensive but they put alot of Bass, Pike & Musky in my Boats & Canoes, used mono only for years then made the switch to Braid & broke lots of Spinnerbaits & went back to Mono or Flouro, I do have my Name for a reason lol Tight Lines SBK"
694306,EC1,2012-05-08 18:17:00,930,"Good Sharing guys! I think I might need to put spinnerbaits in my arsenal after I decided to completely not use them for a year.   The infomercial is terrible! I did get a free one a while back, and I'm not exactly sure I got a model that was on the market because it came with like 20 different sized blades, in colorado, willow, indiana, in like 8 different sizes each.. I just used what was provided on it, and it's pretty good.. Flutters nicely when falling, and has the nice pulsating action in the skirt during the retrieve. Hooks are sharp.  The spinnerbait also is not a tie direct...There's a snap that connects to the spinnerbait. I haven't seen any negative effects yet, I'll let you know a little later."
694307,Harrison,2012-05-08 18:30:00,2202,"Mercman, I'm not much of a spinnerbait anlger anymore, but at one time it was my fav way to fish Smallies, especially on Simcoe.  Used to burn 1oz willow leaf blades as fast as we could just under the surface.  Smallies would crush them out of 20ft of water.  Our ribs would get bruised.  singingdog is bang on about the painted blades and Chart/white skirts, hands down #1 smallie pattern. (Simcoe was silver blades, shiner/white skirts)  Windy, rainy or choppy days are ideal for spinnerbait fishing.  Hard pressed to win a tournament on them (not impossible and has happened, but not very often). Great numbers bait."
694345,mercman,2012-05-08 20:18:00,7054,Great info guys  Thanks a ton. Now i'm pumped to get out there and use 'em.
694352,misfish,2012-05-08 20:44:00,29133," One of my fav, burning/boiling them over deep weeds Phil.  Reaction bait.Many hits will come in the first 3-5 ft of your retreve. My go to is Stanly,silver/brass willow with a white skirt. I also add a yum trailer. I seldom use a stinger,unless they are short stiking the bait.  I find it hard to find the original baits.The new ones Im not to fussy on. If I have to make a second choice,booya. Also give the chatter baits a try Paul. They are killer.  Last thing I can recommend is,dont be afraid to go with 30 pd power pro. Like I said,IMO,this bait is a reaction bait. They don,t care about the line.  Have fun."
694356,misfish,2012-05-08 20:50:00,29133,"Nothing but braid for me. Just my preference.  Another tip now that I,m thinking about it. When retrieving over weeds,let the bait fall/flutter down and rip it out of the weeds and retrieve. You be surprised whats sitting down in them weeds."
694357,mercman,2012-05-08 20:56:00,7054, Keep'em comin boyz!!!
694367,manitoubass2,2012-05-08 21:22:00,11391,"I like braid deep or shallow, just a personal preference really.  I use SB for walleye quite abit, and you need the sensitivity on the drop. Alot of times they hit when the SB is doing nothing but falling to the bottom. With mono, you wouldn't even feel it the majority of the time.  Cool to see everyones color preferences as well. Merc, you started a really good thread with lots of good advice!!!  Oh, I never add anything to the hook, just never found a need for it. But, I am heading out for some smallies here in a few minutes and I'm going to add a 4"" minnow bait and see what the results are."
694369,Christopheraaron,2012-05-08 21:27:00,3525,Interesting video I found...  
694373,mercman,2012-05-08 22:00:00,7054,"Talked to a few locals here too.One guy i will be fishing with next wednesday, hammered 60 nice Pike on sunday using Spinner baits and spoons. Spoons are another lure i havent fished in ages.  Goes to show you, sometimes its the simplest things that catch more fish."
