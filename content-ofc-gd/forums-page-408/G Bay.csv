Plus they re-did the parking there, so now there's only room for about 3 or 4 vehicles  :wallbash:  If you get there past 6:30ish, all the spots are taken.  Aside from that.  There are lot of marinas in the area.  I can't remember the name, but there's a trailor park on the north side of the Wuab Channel.  You take the old steel bridge to get there.  They have a launch, and lots of parking.  Super cheap.  Decent launch."
