I need a battery tray for my new D31 blue top.  Bass Pro Shop doesn't have the D31 size tray, I checked last weekend. The dealer locater on Optima Official site doesnt accept Canadian postal codes.  Thanks"
696599,big guy,2012-05-15 20:44:00,414,I bought a 27 series at Bass Pro last Friday and it was also too large for my tray. So at one end I cut the corners of the tray down to the bottom with a hack saw and then folded the end down flat so the battery would fit in it length wise and lay flat on the bottom of the tray. I'm not worried about it shifting as I have the screws and bar pretty tight across the top. Works like a charm.
