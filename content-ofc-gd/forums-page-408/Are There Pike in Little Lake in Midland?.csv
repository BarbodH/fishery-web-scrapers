696572,rhymobot,2012-05-15 19:24:00,174,I fished it last year and caught a few largies.  But this weekend I'm going up to Penetang and this is the only small lake I know around that area that I can putt around with in an inflatable. Know if there's pike in there?
696577,irishfield,2012-05-15 19:40:00,26272,I wouldn't be fishing that drainage pond if you're gonna be in Penetang anyhow. Your inflatable will be perfectly fine in the harbour and the bonus is a whole better variety to fish for.
696583,davey buoy,2012-05-15 19:49:00,5505," I agree,that lake IS not as good as it once was."
696597,ketchenany,2012-05-15 20:40:00,3229,No pike in that lake according to my book. Just bass.
696600,NAW,2012-05-15 20:46:00,4022,"You should be alright in your inflatable out in penetang bay.  Just watch out for the weather conditions.  I've never fished Little lake, so I can't comment on that.  But if I had to chose between the two, it would be G-Bay for sure."
696614,irishfield,2012-05-15 21:16:00,26272,"It would have to be a pretty wild day in the shelters of Penetang Harbour (and it's dog leg shape) to get too rough for pretty much anything that floats. It's the dorks in the yachts, bow up, that you need to keep an eye on!"
696698,livinisfishin,2012-05-16 00:43:00,661,A hot summer day on little lake during bass season is where i like to spend some time.
696802,johnnyb,2012-05-16 13:14:00,3413,"There are pike in little lake.  Small ones, but I wouldn't call them hammer handles.  More like screwdriver handles.  I'd expect you would catch 5 aggressive OOS bass for every one miniscule pike at this time of year.  Take Wayne's advice and putter around the harbour."
696825,rhymobot,2012-05-16 14:32:00,174,"Thanks for the responses.  However, I should mention that by inflatable I mean a Seylor 12 foot inflatable I got from Walmart for $100 on sale! Though it does have 3 air chambers.  And by putting around I mean I have a Minn Kota with only 30lbs thrust!   I've seen a couple of other lakes on the map in the area but they don't seem accessible to the public. But if there are even little pike in Little Lake then I might give it a try. Especially since it doesn't cost anything so I wouldn't feel like I wasted money if I don't catch."
696826,lew,2012-05-16 14:41:00,12766," It's never a waste of money if you have a good day on the water, catching or not. Some of my best days fishing have resulted in skunks.  It's all about the fishing, not about the catching"
696835,johnnyb,2012-05-16 15:06:00,3413,Oops....just realized that I was talking about Little Lake in BARRIE....forgot that there's another one in Midland.  I take it alllll back.
696862,fishinmortician,2012-05-16 16:46:00,100,"Theres pike here, but wouldn't waste your time in that stagnant water.  Used to take my dog swimming in there all the time until he kept breaking out in funky rashes.  Go to waubaushene or penetang"
696979,livinisfishin,2012-05-16 22:40:00,661,"I've never caught , seen or heard of pike in little lake midland. I spent a lot of time on the lake last summer."
696995,irishfield,2012-05-16 23:06:00,26272,"Same here Jason... always known as a bass lake and it will be assumed that's what you're after, unfortunately, even if there are Pike in there."
696996,davey buoy,2012-05-16 23:12:00,5505,"You should try little lake Barrie, A lot of everything there and somewhat protected. Not that I'm giving any locations:whistling:.Sorry,that still get's me. Lol."
