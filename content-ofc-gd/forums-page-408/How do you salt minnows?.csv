696822,10point,2012-05-16 14:25:00,165,I salted some minnows for the first time this past weekend using this process:  http://www.lakemichiganangler.com/tips/general/how_to_make_salted_minnows.htm  This took some time. Is there a quicker way that some here have had success with? I read somewhere about just having the bait shop put them straight into a zip lock bag and covering them with salt.
696837,Woodsman,2012-05-16 15:09:00,1286,Same method I use. Yes it is a little more work but the results are worth it. They hold the hook better & are far shinier.

I don't lay them on paper towel and bag them so carefully....just throw'em in a tub of salt (the pickling salt) and leave'em in the fridge.  I drain them once a day.  20-30 minnows usually takes 3 days to drain completely.  THEN I put them in the ziplock bag    Then the freezer.  Then I forget to take them fishing with me"

696859,Billy Bob,2012-05-16 16:37:00,5865, You got it right........but there is NO reason to Freeze them......unless you are going to keep them for next year....any minnows salted now should be good for any time this year.
