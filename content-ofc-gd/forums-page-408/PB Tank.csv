695969,G-Man,2012-05-13 23:25:00,47,"Managed to get out today after my black belt test in hamilton. After about an hour on the water we had a small 24 "" in laker. My next turn up I get this BEAST -  It was soo big it took up all of Dad's measuring tape:  I will send to you soon Joey. I learned a secret today too - don't put the rod between your legs when you have about 15lbs of fish on the other end  . Dad sure does have the make-er-a-laker dialed in this spring.  If that was the beast - Dad caught the feast with a nice little salmon for the smoker and the pan   and to think we weren't going to go because we thought it would be too late in the day"
695970,Rod Caster,2012-05-13 23:29:00,5784,You gotta watch where you put that rod handle. Yeouch!  That's a real beauty!! That one fish weighs more than ALL my lakers combined...seriously.
695971,spincast,2012-05-13 23:35:00,3279,"Nice going (AGAIN) G - you get them any bigger and I am gonna need a crane to get them in the boat! G is just a riot - those who have been out with him will tell ya. After we got this thing aboard he looks at me  and goes ""Dad my b...s hurt. I'm not putting the rod there again""   Man overboard ..."
695976,irishfield,2012-05-13 23:53:00,26272,LOL G !! We'll try to beat that one in a couple of months!!
695986,trevy727,2012-05-14 00:19:00,351,Nice fish! Were you guys down rigging? What type of baits were you using? Thanks
695990,limeyangler,2012-05-14 00:22:00,5204,LOL G...yah...watch where you put that rod.....AWESOME FISH!
695997,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-14 00:34:00,2690,"Way to go buddy!  Never too late in the day, glad you two got out.  Hopefully we all fish together, again, soon"
695998,spincast,2012-05-14 00:34:00,3279,"  all the hits today came off the riggers - we also had a 40' jet diver off a planer board and a dipsey running, but no interest in those today. Lakers were all taken on spoons running about 5 ft off the bottom. salmon was about 40 down with a spoon and a SD.  feel free to pm if you want any more details."
696002,Live2fish85,2012-05-14 00:43:00,1633,Way to go G. You are really killing it out there this year.  Congrats on another PB to bud.  As Rick said G is a blast to be out in the boat with. I have fished a few times with him and hes always smiling and positive even when the fish aren't biting.
696411,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-15 03:16:00,2690,Good to see you two sliming the boat.  That really is a hog laker.  Time for some bigger salmon
696413,FisherJuli,2012-05-15 03:24:00,125,"Great work, G!!! You should be proud of that lunker!! Great to hear you're staying on top of them now-- you guys deserved it after all of that hard work. Keep it up!!"
