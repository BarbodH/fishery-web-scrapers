Well apparently everyone that booked ahead of time and anyone with common sense (not me!!)  Finally decided last night to fish pike this weekend and Massasauga was my destination (Spider lake specifically).  I had no clue that sites book up so quickly! I thought it was more a formality than an actual reservation needed well ahead of time. Guess I lucked out the other times.  Anyways....There is a spot on Canoe Lake...and also two neighbouring laakes which are not part of the park but seem to be crown land (Jack and McCoy)look like interesting alternatives to the original plan.  Has anyone been to any of these lakes?  I am just looking for portaging information (length, difficulty, location) and if there are pike in the lakes.  Don't want to go to a bass lake and get fined!!  Thanks"
