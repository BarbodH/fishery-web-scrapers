It would start nodding back and forth quite often, but all but about 3 times it would just stop after a couple of feet and then track straight in.  Weeds.  Couldn't see a lot floating, but they must have been just under the surface and everywhere. Really screwed up the lure action once it picked up a load. Oh well, lesson learned - if you pick up weeds continually, give up on that technique and try another lure."
696040,kickingfrog,2012-05-14 02:11:00,8333,"Another option if you are set on a wtd type bait is to cut off the front facing hook on each of the trebles. It might hinder some hook-ups but the blow-ups are still fun. You can buy trebles with weed guards as well and there are ""weedless"" wtd baits too."
696061,mercman,2012-05-14 02:58:00,7054,"The trick is to reel in to keep the line taught. If the rod tip is pointing up, a quick jerk from 10 to 11 oclock position, and reel in the line to take up the slack. Same idea if pointed down.Quick jerk from 4 to 5 oclock position.Practice practice, you cann do it."
696067,Dave Bailey,2012-05-14 03:25:00,1641," Oh, I was doing it, but like I said, once it picks up a chunk of milfoil the action is killed, impossible from then on. Got tired of clearing it after every cast."
696148,BillM,2012-05-14 14:18:00,17367,Time to run a different lure.  My suggestion would be a Johnson Silver minnow with a big twister tail on the back.   Extremely weedless and you can slow roll them like crazy.  I'd also think it's way to early in the season to be throwing topwaters..  The water out there can't be much over 50 degrees.
696310,Dave Bailey,2012-05-14 23:34:00,1641," Tried a Husky Jerk, even worse for weeds. Somewhere in that bay is a pike with my name on it, just need to keep trying."
696316,Grimace,2012-05-14 23:46:00,2020,"Like Bill said, that sounds like a job for the Johnson silver minnow.  It is a light weight, weedless spoon that is famous for spring pike.  As Bill suggests you can pimp it up a bit with a trailer and slow it right down because of its weight.   Give it a shot.  I love those things."
696343,Dave Bailey,2012-05-15 00:28:00,1641,"Used to throw a weedless Five of Diamonds, but a pike broke it off a couple of years ago and I never got around to buying another one."
696391,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 02:40:00,3525,"NOT too early for top waters! Was fishing little lake in cambridge yesterday and got strikes from perch, large sunfish, bass but sadly no pike. Keep throwin them and tight lines!"
