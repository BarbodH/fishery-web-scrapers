696378,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 02:18:00,3525,"Ok, hope this is a carp, it was feeding and spawning with what I know were carp but I just want to make sure before I submit it for the tournament and find out it's a goldfish! "
696379,danbouck,2012-05-15 02:19:00,4380,Koi
696380,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 02:19:00,3525,Sure? Are we counting koi as carp for the tournament?
696381,Locnar,2012-05-15 02:20:00,645,"Looks like a Koi. I see em every day at work. And as far as I am concerned, they are just a colourful carp."
696382,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 02:23:00,3525,"Hey, if it is a koi I just realized, don't they go for a lot of money? This pond is just filled with these things, and technically I wouldn't be selling ""game fish""."
696385,Locnar,2012-05-15 02:25:00,645,"Yea, big ones can go for more that $150 at my work."
696386,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 02:26:00,3525,"Now I'm seriously thinking about doing black market koi sales, I'll  on it. Actually could I do that?"
696387,eman,2012-05-15 02:27:00,101,Looks like it has grill marks?
696392,hammercarp,2012-05-15 02:42:00,964,Koi. They are common carp that have been bred for their colours. I don't believe you can sell them without a licence. You will get yourself in doodoo for that.
696395,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 02:46:00,3525,"At 150 a piece it's probably worth it, and I doughbt the mnr wants them in our waters anyway."
696400,Dave Bailey,2012-05-15 02:54:00,1641,Koi and goldfish are just carp with bling.
696401,Dozer,2012-05-15 02:56:00,896,"Low grade koi, you will be lucky to get 150 bucks for it.  Fishing at Wonderland?"
696404,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 03:00:00,3525, Ok so I get 75 still puts a smile on my face!
696407,Dozer,2012-05-15 03:03:00,896,"Ya, depending on the size 40 - 50 bucks for sure."
696409,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 03:05:00,3525,"That one was 28 inches, Im reading a lot if legal on the governments site right now and cant seem to find the appropriate licsencing for this purpose, can someone direct me to it. Thanks!"
696582,jimmer,2012-05-15 19:49:00,2730,Wouldn't he need a commercial fishing license for catching and selling?
696585,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 19:53:00,3525,"Nope, emailed the MNR last night and asked about it, he said that there's absolutely no way or license. Oh well, now are we counting them as carp for the tourny?"
696602,Fishing yoda,2012-05-15 20:48:00,29,"never thought this thing would survive around here, always thought a koi would get gobbled up by a muskie or a big pike being bright orange and all!"
696605,Christopheraaron,2012-05-15 20:53:00,3525,"Trust me, this pond doesn't have any pike or muskie, bass, or anything like that, they have the lake all to themselves!"
