695406,captpierre,2012-05-12 02:03:00,2521,"Had a bit of time to kill today so dropped into a large, busy Chinese supermarket in Markham for a snoop.  They have a huge seafood department.  Noticed ""wild crappie and rock bass"" for sale in a pile on ice.  Not huge.  6 inches  or so.  How is this possible?"
695407,ecmilley,2012-05-12 02:05:00,2163,because not enough people complain
695409,NAW,2012-05-12 02:08:00,4022,Wups. Double post...  Don't know how that happened.
695411,NAW,2012-05-12 02:09:00,4022,"What, no MNR stings?  They did it on Wild Justice!"

695414,jedimaster,2012-05-12 02:14:00,3472,I wonder if its the same grocery store I saw these for sale last year?  
695417,manitoubass2,2012-05-12 02:18:00,11391,"Call the MNR tips line, seriously."
695421,northernpike56,2012-05-12 02:26:00,717,"this frustrates me beyond belief. Would it be even better to call the local police? that pic above really ticks me off as well... look at the rainbow trout, chances are he was netted or something or at very least caught with a regular fishing license. It's one thing to see someone take an OOS bass or keep a few extra perch over their limit... but this kinda thing has to be just horrible on our fisheries..."
695433,John Bacon,2012-05-12 03:09:00,3277,This may be perfectly legal. There is commercial fishing in North America. We shouldn't jump to conclusions.
695435,Snidley,2012-05-12 03:19:00,620,"It is legal as they are farm raised and or caught by commercials. They even have ""green Bass"" ie largemouth for sale at some stores. When you see ""Brown Bass"" ie Smallmouth then make your call. Personally I buy the Silver Bass,  White Bass and White Perch all the time. Yummy. The Green Bass are always live and in tanks. Not only are they much more expensive I have a hard time eating Green or Brown Bass since I love catching them so much and it irks me when I see them kept for trophy's or for food even by legal sport anglers."
695492,highdrifter,2012-05-12 11:49:00,2534,"They're probably not ""wild""..  The store is just trying to move stock and the bad rap sheet that farm raised fish have gottent recently isn't helping.."

695520,jedimaster,2012-05-12 13:08:00,3472,I have seen largies for sale as well and always wondered if that's allowed. I would guess its likely farmed or something. I don't think these stores would be in business for long selling fish caught by rod and reel. Not enough to keep the shelves full. Not cost effective enough.
695535,ah_long,2012-05-12 14:08:00,354,the largies we see in supermarket are actually spotted bass I believe.. they're farm raised in California
695561,Michael_Brown,2012-05-12 15:17:00,411,"Perfectly legal and fairly closely monitored. Some of the fish are legal commercially caught fish from Ontario waters, so I guess ""wild"" is from those fish or just for marketing purposes. I personally don't agree with the sale of live panfish as some are considered invasive but it is legal and they are doing nothing wrong."
695668,Rich Nelson,2012-05-12 23:00:00,332,Wont be long before u see Asian Carp in those supermarkets.... Alive!
695769,taper,2012-05-13 06:52:00,611,"Check out the link below, it is a large commercial fishery here in Ontario. It legally sells a ton of Ontario sport fish.  http://www.alltempfoods.com/products.htm"
695771,soobnoob,2012-05-13 09:29:00,55,"Before anyone starts pointing their fingers at asians because it's an ""asian"" supermarket... That sign is from T&T.... Owned and operated by loblaws... Ie: Galen Weston"
696107,highdrifter,2012-05-14 11:16:00,2534, Not a chance.
696228,jedimaster,2012-05-14 18:28:00,3472,"  Is the owner of Loblaws first name actually Bob? as in Bob Loblaw? I have heard that joke so many times, never bothered to see if its real."
696229,Rod Caster,2012-05-14 18:29:00,5784,  He is also a lawyer and oprates Bob Loblaw's Law Blog.
696232,blaque,2012-05-14 18:38:00,2419, took a second........but got it lol
696393,eman,2012-05-15 02:44:00,101, And then one will released live into a watershed. Then a total takeover will begin.
