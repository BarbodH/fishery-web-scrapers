696728,Gregoire,2012-05-16 02:06:00,1397, I would but I only have my G1
696758,corvette1,2012-05-16 08:14:00,1765,sweet looking rod lew maybe we can get out later in the the year for ski's
696759,lew,2012-05-16 09:27:00,12766,"Thanks boyz  Doug & Bruce, let's make it happen."
696821,Andrew Grant,2012-05-16 14:20:00,201,.
696919,Joey,2012-05-16 19:34:00,9122,"Beauty combo Lew, you lucky man"
696938,lew,2012-05-16 20:53:00,12766, I tell myself that every day of the week Joey
697002,Tybo,2012-05-16 23:40:00,1373,Sweet stick Lew.   Does that mean I get one too.Or am I not lucky.
697043,marine5068,2012-05-17 01:20:00,26,"That's a great set-up for sure Lew. Pricey, but what can you say, it's a Calcutta and a St.Croix. I also use mainly Shimano Compres and love them. From what I understand and from my famous Muskie buddy's (Stacy @ Pro Tackle) demo of those split-handle rods for figure-eightin', is that they make them like that with that big ball knob on the end so you can point it into the water with one hand forward grip and put the palm of your back hand on the end to make it easier to roll the tip around for less fatigue when performing those big circles and figure eights. I've never done it that way myself, but Jimmy Saric makes it look easy."
696659,lew,2012-05-15 22:59:00,12766,"I wanted another musky rod for bucktails, bootails and big spinnerbaits and I've been hearing & reading alot of good stuff about St. Croix's Legend Tournament musky series.  I wanted the one piece 8' MHF so I called Gagnons in Oshawa and sure enough they had them in stock so the Mrs. and I took a drive down this morning for a 1st hand look and I hafta tell ya, it is one very sweet fishin pole and I think it's well worth the $255  It's gonna be paired up with a Calcutta 400TE and is without a doubt, the nicest feeling musky outfit I've ever had and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna do very well with it.  Here's a couple pics        Looking forward to getting it slimed in a couple weeks."
696661,MCTFisher9120,2012-05-15 23:03:00,3761,"Nice setup Lew, hope we can get out so you can show me the way of the mighty Musky  But does mean I can share my rod/reel porn too haha   Nice pics, that sunshine outside lately has been great!  MTBF"
696662,Dan668,2012-05-15 23:03:00,1120,Sweet combo. I just bought the same rod. My first quality musky rod. Also the proper version of the reel. A lefty. Haha
696663,lew,2012-05-15 23:05:00,12766,Good talking to you this morning Mike and we'll definetely get out in the next little while.
696664,lew,2012-05-15 23:06:00,12766,"It's definetely a great rod Danbob, good luck with yours."
696666,misfish,2012-05-15 23:12:00,29133,"Lews getting the bling, bling itch.LOL  Nice rod bud.  When we hook up,you can throw the big stick baits. I,ll throw bass tubes and spinner baits from the STERN."
696667,Roy,2012-05-15 23:13:00,13728,Nice setup indeed Lew but did they run out of cork for the butt part?
696668,misfish,2012-05-15 23:17:00,29133," Have you seen the price of cork? Just ask Spiel,,,,,,,,,,,Wait,just ask me.LOL"
696669,mike rousseau,2012-05-15 23:20:00,4661,Very nice combo lew...  Bet you can't wait to our a bend in it...
696672,Roy,2012-05-15 23:25:00,13728,"Doesn't matter Brian. I want full cork, if it's too expensive for the manufacturers, I'll get them made. It certainly doesn't take anything away from Lew's combo. It's a great one!"
696678,misfish,2012-05-15 23:33:00,29133, 
696679,mercman,2012-05-15 23:48:00,7054,My heart went pitter patter when i laid eyes upon that combo.So....whens the tackle purge Lew Congrats  
696680,Live2fish85,2012-05-15 23:54:00,1633,Awesome combo Lew. Can't wait to see what you bring in on it.
696682,Lungelarry,2012-05-16 00:09:00,294,"I bet within a year,your Compre will be up for sale.........."
696685,lew,2012-05-16 00:21:00,12766," I dunno Larry, I've still got 4 Compres and their incredible rods, but time will tell  As for the split grips, that seems to be the way alot of manufacturers are going right now. Supposed to make the rods lighter, but I don't think there's enough difference to be able to tell. All I know is, when I hold this new St. Croix it just feels absolutely perfect in my hands.  I'm not one for gimmicks, but I know what I like."
696690,Joeytier,2012-05-16 00:34:00,3990,Cream of the crop when it comes to musky tackle.  I am definitely jealous!
696693,Ron,2012-05-16 00:36:00,1683,"Here's looking to sore ribs for you Lew. (I mean that in a good way).  Cheers, Ron..."
696695,manitoubass2,2012-05-16 00:42:00,11391," Lew doesn't post pics very often, might be a long wait, lol.  Sweet combo Lew, if it feels perfect, it is perfect!!!  That price tag is well worth it over the long term   "
696697,esoxansteel,2012-05-16 00:43:00,1307,"  Not much lighter, at least not noticable, its just cheaper to build with less cork which is at least 5.00 per inch on a rod, and more expensive on a musky stick with a larger diameter ring. Lots of companies are going back to Eva foam as well to totally eliminate the high cost of quality cork, which you would think that large companies like Shimano, StCroix and so on would have large volume buying discounts."
696700,Rizzo,2012-05-16 00:49:00,4754,congrats on the new purchase! Now time to start counting the days!
696702,esoxansteel,2012-05-16 00:51:00,1307,"I love my Compres too, but they dont come even close to the St. Croix Legend Tournaments, and the new compres are very tip heavy in the 8ft 6in and 9in models, and fatigue will be a factor throwing big baits with them im sure, a very sweet combo Lew, just 18 short days to load er up with the slime factor."
696712,Gregoire,2012-05-16 01:24:00,1397,Sweat rod. I'd kill for that combo...not literally though.
696714,mercman,2012-05-16 01:27:00,7054,  Yes you would...............
696717,bigbuck,2012-05-16 01:38:00,2449,Nice Lew!! That's the Cadillac of musky setups. We have to get out and wash a lure or two this summer.
696719,Pigeontroller,2012-05-16 01:42:00,2793,"They are nice, I have 3 of them, and I like the split grip! Even have some Bass rods with it."
