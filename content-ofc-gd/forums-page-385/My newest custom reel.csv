715959,ah_long,2012-07-19 04:15:00,354," all the parts could be sourced from tacklewarehouse, plat, japan tackle  the TDZ is an MG reel so anodizing won't be an option and I want a pearl effect  milling knobs sounds interesting, if you can turn out some titanium knobs, I'll definitely be interested"

715021,The JAY,2012-07-16 19:35:00,239,"Very nice work... I do custom airbrush painting on bikes, cars, and anything else that will stand still long enough, even my dishwasher... Never thought to do a reel. Is it automotive grade paint? Clear? etc? Thanks for showing...."
715022,mike rousseau,2012-07-16 19:44:00,4661,i gotta ask  how much did it cost for the reel and the custom work?
715036,cynmar,2012-07-16 20:18:00,169,I must be sooooooo cheap because if I had reels like that they'd never see the light of day. They'd be sitting on a pedestal by my desk so clients could ooohhhhaahhhhh at them.

715529,Dan668,2012-07-17 22:54:00,1120,"Thanks, looks like ill be purchasing the boca"
715708,krixxer,2012-07-18 14:22:00,274," Nice work but why the auto paint???   this stuff should be done using a single stage polyurethane over epoxy.   best yet, anodize all the AL bits before the primer.    . . . after the season I'll make a step by step from stripping to anodizing to paint. Might even mill out some knobs .....  where do you get all them shiny bits? can you post a few links where I could get some ideas?"
