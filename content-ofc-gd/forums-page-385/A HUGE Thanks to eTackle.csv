715135,nroadrunner,2012-07-17 00:21:00,113,Well I placed an order a couple weeks ago with etackle.  Needed some line for the new baitcaster I bought and also a few new Live Target frogs.   My wife got a call from Phil last week that the order was returned to him.  He was very apologetic and insisted he would throw something in for the troubles.  Turns out it was a shipping label issue.  Package arrived today with everything I ordered along with some FREEBIES. I would have been happy with a package of hooks but no here is what arrived  Package of saft baits  2 hard baits package of line  Very unneccessary but greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot Phil for the great customer service.  Now if I could get you to carry everything I use I would never have to order any where else LOL    Thanks again    Ian
