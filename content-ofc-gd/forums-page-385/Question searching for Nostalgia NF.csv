715183,backbay,2012-07-17 02:24:00,773," Thanks pal, most of us were talking about the 60s!, maybe earlier! Personally, I enjoy my brews from a glass, though....."
715194,dave524,2012-07-17 02:43:00,4508,"Lots of old soda bottles from this region here, some milk bottles too that you other old timers may remember  http://www.ecbw.ca/tim_maitland_collection/index.htm"
715200,Default User,2012-07-17 02:54:00,72,Surprised you guys remember the 60's LOL. (I've heard the stories)
715211,bigugli,2012-07-17 03:30:00,6138,"I still have my original 300 and the glass rod. It was my first, very own, rod and reel"
715263,bushart,2012-07-17 12:32:00,2628,"  I still have a cork handled red coloured glass rod and Johnson Skipper reel (does'nt work so great anymore)---was the 1st outfit my Dad bought me in 67  I'm not a hoarder by any stretch---but ya never get rid of those things  And once in a while I make sure I put a Red rod in a paintin  ""Obsessive Compulsive"""
715269,dave524,2012-07-17 12:38:00,4508,"I've still got the first spinning reel that I bought with my own money, a JW Young Ambidex #4, everyone has Mitchell 300's back in the early 60's , I wanted something different   My dad was a avid fisherman and tournament caster, so he got me good stuff when I was younger, my very first spinning reel back in the late 50's was an Airex Spinster, built by the Lionell model train people"
715276,bushart,2012-07-17 12:47:00,2628,Fast Fact.....Lionel Trains is now owned by Neil Young  apparently a huge model train buff
715279,Harrison,2012-07-17 12:50:00,2202,"Love Vernors.  I get mine at Metro.  Killer with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream (the real stuff).  A treat for me once in a blue moon.  My girls do not drink pop, but I got a good chuckle when each of them had their first sips of vernors"
715295,bushart,2012-07-17 13:16:00,2628,O-Fish-All Vernors update  I called a local Metro store---thinkin if they carried down south then maybe???  Apparently they tried and are unable in this area---so I'll see if the bros will deliver
715297,Harrison,2012-07-17 13:18:00,2202," IF not, I have a good deal with some couriers.  Just let me know."
715300,dave524,2012-07-17 13:30:00,4508," Haven't had it in a long time but remember it being pretty zippy for a ginger ale, closer to the old ginger beers."
714976,bushart,2012-07-16 16:46:00,2628,"Back in the 70's my family used to visit in a little town in Southwestern Ontario called ""Arkona""  Quaint little place---straight out of a Rockwell painting  Anyway----I always enjoyed going to the little gas station store there complete with the wood floors and gettin a (glass bottle) of Vernors Ginger Ale---loved it  Anyway years passed and I never found it around much at all-----Until we moved back here to the Ottawa Valley  Now when we 1st went to the Renfrew Wal Mart---low and behold---they sold it in cans-----BINGO!!---bought it all the time  Till they changed it to a Superstore---no more bingo  Anyway my Bros are comin for a visit from The Hammer---anybody ever see this available out there in the Hamilton area?---then they could haul me up some.  "
714978,Spiel,2012-07-16 16:53:00,9065,"Love Vernors Gingerale Terrence, takes me back to my youth fishing with Grampa and stopping in those little country stores where you pulled a bottle right out of ice water!  But given that I don't think you'll find bottled Vernors, but most every grocery store in Hamilton has 12 packs of canned Vernors, your brothers only need to look for it.  Oh and it does taste every bit as good, just lacks the nostalgia.  Add in....A quick search shows Metros carries it locally here in Hamilton"

715020,The JAY,2012-07-16 19:32:00,239,"I don't remember seeing it as a wee one, back in the '70s, but I remember it appearing at the corner store around the time Wishing Well disappeared.... Just reminiscing... LOL    As Spiel said, Vernors is available at most grocery stores, and most 'variety' stores as well. You might just find it in bottles at the smaller ones too... But plastic, not glass, sorry...."
715025,bushart,2012-07-16 19:48:00,2628,Thanks Jay  Yeah I could go on about the good ole days forever----makes me sound like the old geezers talkin when I was a kid
715042,misfish,2012-07-16 20:24:00,29133, Thanks for making me feel old.
715055,bushart,2012-07-16 20:51:00,2628,C'mon Bri-----all us old guys know---pop was best outta that water cooler in a glass bottle----Pepsi or RC Cola  A dream I have is to just drive an old pick up through the country--say early 60's---shifter on da floor  Summer day----elbow out the window---just cruise
715065,misfish,2012-07-16 21:22:00,29133,"  Ok,you just made me feel young again Terrance.   Anyone see the drink ""TAB"" around?"
715067,Roy,2012-07-16 21:25:00,13728,Sure I remember TAB  It's not that old...early 60's is when it came out I believe.

715080,Joey,2012-07-16 21:46:00,9122,"I remember several years ago I went to the Domican Republic and took a bottle of vodka with me.  I figured I could buy some sprite at the main gift shop of my hotel.  Well, lets just say, the gift shop lacked many things, and when I asked for Sprite or 7-Up and explained the reason why, they went to the back room and brought back a dusty 24 pack of ""Teem"" bottles, the green ones with the dimples in them.  It tasted fine but I had not seem them since my youth.  Anyone remember Teem?"
715087,bushart,2012-07-16 22:03:00,2628,  Yeah---those must have been well aged
715094,lew,2012-07-16 22:35:00,12766, I remember back when we we're kids every once in awhile we'd get a very rare green  bottle outta the COKE vending machine and always considered that a bonus...for some unknown reason that long ago escaped me  We always called them American bottles but I have no idea why.  Seems to me we payed a whopping .07 cents for a COKE back then too.
715098,Roy,2012-07-16 22:56:00,13728," If you remember Teem, you remember Wink."
715102,Ben_Daniels,2012-07-16 23:11:00,435,"Not quite sure where you can find Vernor's, but I know its the oldest soda pop still being made, dates back to the 1800's"
715121,bigugli,2012-07-16 23:54:00,6138,"As a kid there were only 2 places to really get a good Verner's. At the Ex and at Eaton's Annex, bsmt level. You still got it poured out from the keg in the 60's and early 70's The ice cream waffles at the Annex and the Ex were damn good too!!   Boy do I miss that kinda stuff."
715126,mike rousseau,2012-07-17 00:01:00,4661,I found a bunch of old glass Coke and Pepsi glass bottles in the river while snorkeling... They musta been covered by sand for 50 years... Then when the current was right the sand was swept away and I found em...  They where from the 50s if I remember correctly
715130,fish_fishburn,2012-07-17 00:10:00,1311,Fanta anyone
715150,dave524,2012-07-17 01:20:00,4508,Any one remember Kist brand soda pop?
715158,backbay,2012-07-17 01:34:00,773,"I remember 'em all, but Verner's was a breed apart! That said, as a tyke, I used to love getting one of those little (absolutely freezing) bottles of Coke from the vending machine...."
715163,bigugli,2012-07-17 01:44:00,6138,You mean the old water filled pop coolers. Fingers would be chilled in a minute. Oh the days of running up to Gerry Bye's or Tolles and picking my 6  pack from the cooler and a pocket full of penny candies.
715169,bushart,2012-07-17 02:03:00,2628,Yeah Vernors had a taste apart from the rest  Now it reminds us of simpler times-----bamboo fishin poles---and Saturday night on the steps of the General Store in the summer---listening to the farm stories---and the crickets chirp
715170,backbay,2012-07-17 02:04:00,773," A Zebco spincaster, later, a Mitchell 300....."

But I do remember, and LOVE, drinking soda from glass bottles when I was younger. Which is kinda funny - because now I LOVE drinking my beer out of glass bottles LOL"
