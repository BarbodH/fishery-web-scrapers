700416,Headhunter,2012-05-28 13:48:00,5703,Great report! Some really nice pics as well.. HH
700417,johnnyb,2012-05-28 13:49:00,3413,Thanks for the kind words folks....glad you enjoyed...I'm still wishing I was back up there....bugs or not!     Paul you have to get into that spot....can basically go in circles from one shore to the other....always some springtime laker action in there   We tried for just a short bit trolling for eyes...probably should have gone out again after dark...oh well.  Next time    I think it was just dishwashing....no wait...it WAS a release shot   Oh yes...you know the lake   Glad I could oblige....and appreciated the friendly encouragement to get it posted.  But seriously.  DOOOOD.  This perogie pizza is insane!  They even give you sour cream for dipping....and after 3 slices the heat really starts to kick in.  It takes a backseat to no other pizza!

715635,irishfield,2012-07-18 05:46:00,26272,Honest.. it's a chocolate bunny that Leah sent me with so they had some tail to share!

699575,johnnyb,2012-05-25 19:03:00,3413,"Well this was supposed to be a well written, descriptive report that would make an attempt to capture the beauty and majesty of Temagami back country……but I've been busy all week and need to get this posted!  So here are the numbers, followed by the pics.  I like to yak, so there might be a little bit of commentary on the way   Friday before the May long weekend we rolled out of Mississauga – myself along with my cousins Bert (bicephalic on the board) and Brian.  Hit Muskoka by 11, had the tinner trailered up, received homemade sandwiches from my mom (bless her) and were rolling northward by noon.  Couple of stops to make in North Bay….Rodcaster and I swapped gear – trout spinners for me, and a sail to fit his canoe, for him.  Then Trouty, who was around the corner, insisted we take a bag of frozen smelt.  Good eats – can turn down an offer like that from the big Tee  Finally finally finally the cell phone signal started to fade and we hit the Temagami Access Road.  Jeep unpacked, got a nice close parking spot, and boat loaded up.  Well.  Loaded DOWN.  One of these years the waves crossing the hub are going to mess with us….but they stayed on the bottom side of the gunnels this year  Hit the portage, dragged everything, including tinner and 8hp (thank goodness it's a 2-stroke!) over the 200m or so portage, and then found a campsite.  At the portage, we bumped into a party that uh…how shall I say this….made us look real good.  2 little boats with a fair bit of water in them, 1 motor between the two, 2 adults a teenager and a young guy about 10.  No map…they had been lost on the big lake and given a map….but they were happy to be at the right spot!  We started moving their gear, not so much to be nice but more to get them out of the way as it's a tight squeeze on the trail.  By the time we caught up to them on the next lake, they were camped out with a roaring fire, prevailing wind blowing it right into their campsite.  Yes there was a fire ban.  Yes, they lit fireworks off that night.  Sigh.  Ah well….the point it…we made it to the lake and could get camp and our rods set up.  First camp.  Then a DELICIOUS perogie pizza that we packed in all the way from LuLu's in Callander.  TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!  Then we told the passing fishing boat that season wasn't open (different party than the maples firebugs) then we got ready for bed.  OK.  The rambling is out of control already.  If you haven't  scrolled down by now to look at the pics, I commend you.   HERE ARE THE STATS:  Trip in:  2hr 24mins moving time, 17.38kms travelled.  Avg. speed 7.2km/h….top speed of 11.1km/h  Trip out: 2hr 11mins moving time, 15.91kms travelled.  Avg. speed 7.3km/h…top speed of 13.4kmh/h  Notice it was shorter on the way out….I didn't have the GPS in my pocket at the portage.  Which means I went back and forth carrying stuff on the way in for 1.47kms…on a 200m portage    Also, we achieved a higher top speed….not as much due to wind directions as it was to having a lot less beer on board.  Day 1 – AM Session: 2 hrs trolling, 3.0km/h avg. speed, 6.94kms travelled.  Surface temp 54F  4/5 on lakers  -- most falling to a silver dartee with blue/red stickers 20-30 feet down, over 60-70FOW  We kept 2 for the pan, and of course as they were getting cleaned, Wayne showed up.  Impeccable timing I gotta say    We had a great visit with him….he even brought us some tail…which I don't have pictures of for some reason…..don't worry it was just a chocolate bunny  J  He took a few casts between chatting and eating, and popped his first fish of the season up there.  Good ol' Temagami mountain trout…aka OOS Smallmouth  Day 1 – PM session: 2hrs trolling/drift jigging.  Covered 6.6kms  Only went 1/2 on lakers, with the one we lost being the most painful.  Bert had it to the boat, and it looked like it was pushing the 10lb mark if not more.  The fish we did catch was Brian's first laker – saw it coming up on the screen as he reeled in from trolling….told him to drop the line back down and BOOM fish on!  Actually birdsnested the heck out of the leadcore spool he had, so the fish got hand lined in….it hit before he closed the bail…fun times!  It measured 22"", so we had it for lunch then went in search of gators for Bert to redeem himself with.  Day 1 – PM Session#2 – 3/3 on pike, with the biggest being a very thick 35""x15"" that Bert picked up as soon as we got into the back bay.  Spotted it, dropped a big jig to it, and it was ON!!  The most scarred up female I've ever seen… big bite marks on the back…skin flapping….but she was released strong.  Also looked like she may have eaten one of her suitors….serious bulge in the belly.  The other 2 pike were super healthy and clean specimens…both taken by me on a silver/black husky jerk…not sight-fished.  One low 30""s and another about 24""…perfect eating size.  AND SO TASTY   The last time we came to this bay, we caught almost everything by sight-fishing…seems that this year most of the spawners left the warm shallows already.  Water temps on the surface were 68F  Day 2 – AM session: 2 hrs, 6.2kms trolled, same areas as first day, water temps up to 56F  3/5 on lakers….2 small ones and a nice 23""er for Bert on a watermelon coloured spoon down at 40 feet, pretty much ticking bottom.  Day 2 – PM – we spent most of the afternoon without getting a bite.  ANYwhere…travelled 21kms in 7 hrs…trolling, jigging, casting to shore, and noticed that the surface temp was climbing into the mid 60's.  Finally found a 30 foot flat that we couldn't find the deep side of, leading into a bay that registered a chilly 56F so I put the cannonball down at 20 with a watermelon spoon out the back and popped a nice 22""er….thing peeled drag and gave a heck of a fight….thought it was going to be much bigger.  The next morning we packed up early in hopes that we would fish the big lake after unloading the boat, or possibly fish a bit further south, but it was not to be.  Ultimately, a wise decision, as long weekend traffic chewed up any extra time we had on the drive home.   Another May opener on the books in Temagami, and another fantastic trip leaving us wanting more.  Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed    Bring on the pics!!!!                                                                            "

699589,Fang,2012-05-25 19:58:00,1330,"Nice one Johnny, I never left the island up there all weekend. Took a while for me figure out that trolling route but then I saw which way the North arrow was pointing. Never fished in that spot before.  Did you manage a few trolls for walleye. How were the bugs??? I'm still scratching bites as they were brutal back around Spawning Bay at the place I was staying"

Thanks again for the sail. I'll bring it to the sportspal shop and see what they do about getting me the nessecary accessorie to make it work. I'm definitly not installing that huge sail without stabilizers!haha.  Thanks for putting up this report. I love seeing reports from that area... Gives me ideas for futures portages, too. Woo hoo."
