715432,misfish,2012-07-17 18:58:00,29133," PM sent.  You should look into a float tube too. That way, I wont be alone to catch all the fish this fall.LOL"
715433,Christopheraaron,2012-07-17 19:01:00,3525,"I'm planning on getting one too, it will be good for things like the grand, holland and maybe even the credit."
715434,misfish,2012-07-17 19:09:00,29133, Let me know how that rash works out for you.
715439,Christopheraaron,2012-07-17 19:20:00,3525,I got waders.
715459,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-17 19:52:00,10439, Or you could stumble on a high quality inflatable for stupid low $$$ like I did. My inflatable in the first pic is an older Southern Pacific inflatable (same kind of quality as a Zodiac). To purchase a new one (same model as mine but with aluminum floor instead of wood) is about $1500 US. I found mine at a garage sale for.......................wait for it.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................TEN BUCKS!!!!!!  I has a small leak in the floor but the air chambers are solid and there are zero patches on it!!! The motor was extra of course and I had to purchae oars for it.  Including the motor I have less than $900 in the rig.  There are deals to be had if you are in the right place at the right time.
715505,adolson,2012-07-17 21:30:00,783," *chimes in*  I love my 12-foot Sportspal that weighs like 35lbs and sits on top of my '97 Achieva quite nicely.  I am looking to get a 44lb 14-footer though, so I can fit a third person or up to 300lbs more gear and it'll have a keel or three so it stays a little straighter. And it'll fit on my van better.  I'd say make sure you have a keel at least (all the new ones have them, but my 12-footer is - I believe - one of the original 5000, and has none)."
715507,Christopheraaron,2012-07-17 21:34:00,3525," x2 mine doesn't have one and the thing is basically a sail, not much control."
715515,woodenboater,2012-07-17 22:25:00,2277,my old Kevlar has a small shoe keel but any new composite I would buy would be keel less. I'd rather have maneuverability than 'straight line tracking'. My paddle strokes provide all the control I would need vs keels. imo
715524,adolson,2012-07-17 22:41:00,783,"Yeah, well, we're talking about apples and oranges, here. You don't paddle a Sportspal. Or at least, I wouldn't! haha. Row it, maybe..."
715533,woodenboater,2012-07-17 23:06:00,2277,"ok, you got me there Dana but you shld check out other canoes before going for a longer Sportspal. Your arms will thank you"
715541,SirCranksalot,2012-07-17 23:28:00,3291, Amen!!
715543,adolson,2012-07-17 23:31:00,783,"Actually, my arms thank Minn Kota!"
715591,craigdritchie,2012-07-18 01:45:00,1586,"My old Zodiac was a 10 foot Cadet model that I bought used from some guy who had it advertised in the paper. They're expensive boats to buy new. The one I had was a bit older, but still worked perfectly fine. It had a multi-piece wooden floor, so it was a bit heavy. The newer ones have a fibreglass floor, I believe, so they should be a lot lighter weight.  Not sure who your closest dealer is, but you could probably Google their website and do a dealer search. Or keep an eye on Kijiji or eBay and see if you can pick up a used one. If you're not in a hurry, that's the best way to save a few bucks. Can't say enough good things about them, they really are great boats. But you definitely want an electric or a small gas motor. They're no fun to row.  My good friend Mark Krupa has one too. You would not believe the fish that he's hauled into that little boat of his. His fishing photo album would make a lot of guys cry."
715601,danc,2012-07-18 02:46:00,4677," I've seen his Labrador Brook Trout adventure in hd at least a dozen times , and I'll watch it again every chance I get. The best fishing show ever produced imho."
715623,Musky or Specks,2012-07-18 04:05:00,2710,"14 pounds that really freaking heavy for a float tube. If you want to back pack your float tube,waders,wading shoes,fins, fishing gear and camping equipment in anywhere you gotta go light this is mine Had it since 1994 and still works like a charm.  http://creekcompany.com/product.php?productid=16150&cat=249&page=1"
715669,Live2fish85,2012-07-18 12:44:00,1633," That is a great deal lol. I know that you can find good deals and that, just takes alot of patience and quick response.  My cousin loves them and is always buying them and fixing them up and sells them again for more then he paid.  I personally would love the second one you posted a picture of."
715680,Fish4Eyes,2012-07-18 13:11:00,1022,"As portable as they may be, I'm not a fan of inflatables simply due to the sense of security. Fishing requires sharp hooks and sharp hooks and thin inflated rubber just don't mix with me, especially considering the amount of money I have in my gear.  I would personally get a small 6-8' alumimum boat and transport it on your roof or a Porta-Bote (portable folding boat). The Porta-Bote's come in various lengths. A quick search discovered they are plentiful on kijiji: http://ontario.kijiji.ca/f-porta-bote-Classifieds-W0QQKeywordZportaQ20bote"
715713,craigdritchie,2012-07-18 14:31:00,1586,"Good quality inflatables are tougher than you think. They're used by navies all over the world, with guys jumping in and out all day long with machine guns, knives, and all kinds of other expensive, pointy stuff. They have no problem.  I agree some boats have thin skin, but not all. A Zodiac is just about indestructible."
715746,Fish4Eyes,2012-07-18 16:06:00,1022," Agreed, but certainly not a cheap option like the OP was asking for."
715748,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-18 16:08:00,10439," Yeah, quality costs money. My pontoon is about $1000 new and the inflatable is $1500 new."
715763,Musky or Specks,2012-07-18 17:00:00,2710,I got my Cimmeron Pontoon off Kijiji last Christmas for 170 Brand new in the box Its all about timing
715807,misfish,2012-07-18 18:52:00,29133, All spots are road side.The tube would eliminate the back packing.  Thanks for the link.
715208,hotsky,2012-07-17 03:12:00,400,"Almost every time I fish in a lake I find myself wishing I had a boat  and now I'm seriously considering getting something. The problem is I live in an apartment and it will be a at least a year or two before I'll own a house; so storage is an issue. Also, I don't have a truck (drive a Mazda 3) which makes towing anything big unrealistic. So when I say I'm need 'boat' ideas I'm pretty much looking at anything, including kayaks, or inflatable boats. Neither are ideal because I could imagine it would be hard to handle anything bigger from a kayak, and inflatable boat would need to have some kind of a seat and be sturdy enough not to pop if I hit a branch under water. (I have a small 2 person one that can hold 410lbs, I use at when I go to a beach for fun but I would never fish from it). Ideally I'd like to have a trolling motor so something like Pelican Predator 103 would be perfect, but i would have to figure out something for storage. Is there anything similar but even smaller and lighter?  Suggestions on any suitable small boats, kayaks or inflatables would be much appreciated."
715209,BillM,2012-07-17 03:14:00,17367,Pontoon.
715214,Default User,2012-07-17 04:06:00,72,"Seems like there's a few of us with Mazda 3's LOL  I actually got an inflatable earlier this year. Since then, I've googled and YouTubed ideas on how to make it more fishing friendly.  Sevylar and Intex have quite a few good iBoats that are made of thick vinyl. Many people have outfitted them with hard floors, seats and trolling motors.      I got the SeaHawk 4. Took it out and I'll say this much. Forget rowing - definitely need to get a trolling motor (30lb or more) Forget about Big lakes. And make sure the weather is in your favor (windy days suck)  They're great for calmer waters  Here's a pic of my Mazda and the SeaHawk to give you an idea of the size of it.   Transporting it is a breeze if you have a roof rack LOL.  Saves the trunk space for the cooler, gear (and the future trolling motor)  Manual Pumping can get tiresome especially on a hot day - or when your eager to get out there.  I just grabbed a Coleman electric inflater which gets it 95% full. Then fill it up with the hand pump."
715215,Musky or Specks,2012-07-17 04:11:00,2710,This is my bigger version of my U tube for when the water is colder and its not a super long hike. Fits in my Intrepid  http://www.the-boating-store-blog.com/review-cimarron-classic-inflatable-fishing-pontoon-boat/
715218,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-17 04:34:00,10439,Here's a couple of ideas fer ya!!    
715231,hirk,2012-07-17 10:49:00,571,"A float tube,why? Cheaper,better position control and hands free to fish while controlling/moving it, very comfortable."
715236,mercman,2012-07-17 11:13:00,7054,Theres a few guys on here with sportspal canoes.I'm sure the will chime in any time.They have presented some great reports out of these sturdy canoes.
715253,craigdritchie,2012-07-17 12:17:00,1586,"A good quality inflatable won't puncture from a tree branch. In fact, you would have a hard time pushing a hook through the better-made ones.  I had a Zodiac years ago, back when I lived in an apartment. Folded up to fit in a bag that I kept in a hall closet. It was an awesome fishing boat. With a battery and a small electric, you could go almost anywhere, and it all fit in a small car no problem."
715256,johnnyb,2012-07-17 12:22:00,3413,Terry used to have a Portabote....pretty sure he had good things to say about it.  Folds right up to the size of a surfboard.
715285,Christopheraaron,2012-07-17 13:01:00,3525,"This is not a obvious choice but what about a topper? they can handle slightly bigger water, if you get the smaller sizes they weigh about 80lbs, you could fit it into a storage locker, you can get it on a roof, they sell them at bass pro for $500."
715287,Warthaug,2012-07-17 13:04:00,30,"I've made a few of these: http://www.instructables.com/id/8-Folding-Kayak/  Cheap, work well, can be stored in even the smallest of apartments.  Add a rod holder or two and you're set...  Bryan"
715291,SirCranksalot,2012-07-17 13:08:00,3291,Canoe! Canoe! Canoe!
715294,smally21,2012-07-17 13:15:00,993,"I think its great the way guys don't let storage space or smaller vehicles or what have you get in the way of your fishing.  Hardcore, diehard, resourceful whatever you want to call it..  :clapping:  drifter those small lake fishing machines look awesome."
715310,Snidley,2012-07-17 14:27:00,620,I vote Sea Eagle Fold Cat http://www.seaeagle.com/FoldCat.aspx. Rolls up into your trunk plus I've seen one in person and they are very well made (unlike most inflatables). I've also seen something lately that bears investigation for kayaks. Personally I don't like canoes or kayaks for fishing because the  seated position is not optimal for casting. They are great if you like to troll but casting is just not that great from a canoe or kayak. Now Scotty downriggers has come up with stabilizers that attach to a kayak so that you can stand up and cast or flip. If they are good quality that could be a real find and you should look at the option if you are considering a Yak.
715311,woodenboater,2012-07-17 14:31:00,2277,I'm guessing they're a bit pricey but the Porta Botes look like a good concept. Nice small water type boat. Storage could be the issue however but they seem to move like stink with the right engine hanging off the back
715375,hotsky,2012-07-17 17:09:00,400,I'm still looking into different options but Sevylor FishHunter 4 perosn boat looks like it could work. It's ~ $200 which is cheap compared to most other boats. Leaves some cash for a trolling motor set up. Something like Yacht Tenders from Sea Eagle would be perfect but around $1000+ is a little pricy. Maybe I'll have to sell some things and up my budget! Anyone use them?
715377,Moosebunk,2012-07-17 17:13:00,3970,"Started with a float tube... and likely when I'm old and grey and they've taken my licenses away, I'll end in one too.  So many solid options but it's all based on your use and budget.  Pontoon boats if you're not hoofin' them in too far and have the car space are a better plan than a float tube really.  Good luck!"
715393,hotsky,2012-07-17 17:34:00,400,"Craig_Ritchie, which Zodiac did you have? and who sells them?"
715416,Live2fish85,2012-07-17 18:26:00,1633," If a $1000 is a bit high then a zodiac may not be your best bet. They aren't cheap. Specailly new, you can find them on kijiji for under a grand but for the most part they have been patched alot and I wouldn't really want to take a chance at that money.  As Moosebunk said the fishing float tubes are great, you can get them for a couple hundred even cheaper and if it is colder weather and water just get a nice pair of neoprene waders and ypur laughing."
715417,misfish,2012-07-17 18:34:00,29133,So what would one recommend for a good quality float tube?
715422,hotsky,2012-07-17 18:42:00,400,Anyone bought from i boats.com? They ship to Canada and give you a quote on their site when you put in a postal code.
715423,Moosebunk,2012-07-17 18:44:00,3970, Outcast for sure!!!  http://www.outcastboats.com/outcast/products/default.aspx?series=10

715428,misfish,2012-07-17 18:50:00,29133,"  Thanks Drew.  I,m seriously looking for one.For small lakes and the river."
715429,davey buoy,2012-07-17 18:53:00,5505," How about jump in my boat Saturday bud?.,have a good pair of glasses if need be.South Simcoe? eh."
