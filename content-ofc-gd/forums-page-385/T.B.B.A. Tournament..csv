Still waiting on final numbers and names....Anyway First i would like to say Thank you so much to those Gents & Ladies who kindly donated to our Donation box. It is very much appreciated. We are a non profit oganization as most of you are allready aware and we rely heavily on Donations,. Every single penny counts and makes a difference. Our purpose is to protect, Educate people and the future generations about conservation and live release. So that our Children there children & future Generations can enjoy our fantastic fisheries & the great out doors that we are so fortunate to have here in Canada. We are desperatley trying to raise funds of $2000 to make some very much needed repairs to the live release boat. This is the only live release boat in our erea plus we also travel to other tournaments outside of Norfolk county. We don't charge a fee which is why as i previously said! Donations are what we depend on. We will be reaching a mile stone next year. 25 years which in my oppinion is quiet an achievment. I am asking all my fellow fisherman & woman to please spread the word about what it is we do and any help anyone can offer us would be so much appreciated you truly have no idea.

This is only because of the Live release boat so please please we need your support . I have alot of photo's to sort through and will post a couple more so keep watching this space Thank you so much.
