715701,Harrison,2012-07-18 14:07:00,2202,"There's a sweet deal to be had you see First dibs on place with bedrooms three Is fishing there any good? Would you buy if you could? Please share your experince there with me  I was just offered a sweet deal and I'm researching it for my family who is thinking of going north. . I fished there years ago, but forget much of the expereince. I do remember having to launch at the Marina.  Is there other launches? Is it a busy lake?  Anyone have any bad experiences there?  Thanks, Phil"
715723,Jer,2012-07-18 14:54:00,1426,"I've fished there a few times, Phil.  Real nice lake, never seemed too busy (mind you I'm used to the traffic on Buckhorn). Most of the cottages are water access only. Did well for smallies and lotsa big rockbass. Lake trout in the lake too from what I understand though have never targeted them.  Plenty big for a cottage lake with access to Mephisto and St Ola lakes as well.  We launched (and camped once) at Limerick Lake Lodge (Martin's Landing), I think there is a ramp and marina in St Ola as well."
715726,jedimaster,2012-07-18 14:58:00,3472,One of my favorite lakes to fish for Bass. If you can get a good deal then go for it.

715740,ecmilley,2012-07-18 15:50:00,2163,decent fishing lake with easy access to the rest of the bancroft district when the bug to try a different lake bites. as far as i remember there is the launch at the marina one at the bottom of st ola lake and a rather rough on on mephisto. usually there is one clubby tournament a year there and there is a canoe route through there go for it nice area
715741,mercman,2012-07-18 15:50:00,7054,"I hear that the fishing is good  I would buy there for sure if i could  The Bass fishing is fine But you'll need some strong line  Cause the trophies abound, understood?    "

715839,Joeytier,2012-07-18 20:24:00,3990,"If you love bass fishing, you'll be in heaven.  Tons of classic smallie and largie structure, with real big fish.  The laker numbers are way, way down, as most of the lakes in the area are.  I've never seen more than a small handful of boats at a time on the lake.  I've always enjoyed my time there"

715845,soobnoob,2012-07-18 20:51:00,55,I was there bout 3 weeks ago. launched out of limerick lake lodge marina on the west side of the lake. Everywhere you go is submerged timber so watch your props. LOTS of bass (including rock bass). Apparently deepest part of the lake is about 90-100 feet.

715901,scott_f,2012-07-19 00:14:00,3,I've fished there but not for a number of years now. Also launched at Limerick Lake Lodge. I agree .... lots of timber with not much weed although there was some cabbage weed near the marina that held some really good largemouth. Killed them on a topwater one day in wicked fog ..... so thick that I didn't want to chance driving in it so I just put the trolling motor right at the marina and cruised out from there.  Also had some luck in Dark Lake which in connected to Limerick at the north end. Water is (was?) somewhat stained but there was a number of blowdowns that held fish.
