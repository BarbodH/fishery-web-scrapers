715144,ctranter,2012-07-17 00:46:00,543,"So many cross-curricular learning opportunities can be accessed as a result of this initiative - I love it!  The best part is that ""spec ed"" learners have been proven to be more engaged in their learning and retain more knowledge when animals (or other dependents, i.e. a plant) is present.  It's nice to see science ""in action"", rather than just restricted to the texts.  I'm sure the kiddies learn life lessons too, such as life and death and respecting nature.  If only we could get something like this in the TDSB, I would support a program like this in my classroom in a heartbeat."

715736,spinnerbaitking,2012-07-18 15:34:00,1622," I have a few picked out but only 1 confirmed that they want it so far, the Principal of the new Super School being built has said they would like 1 but since it won't be ready until next fall I think she will take it to the Wingham Public School that will have Grade 5/6 from the whole area, need to have a meeting with LHFC to confirm school & we need to have the Schools on board, since they are on summer break it might be hard to finalize before September Tight Lines SBK"
