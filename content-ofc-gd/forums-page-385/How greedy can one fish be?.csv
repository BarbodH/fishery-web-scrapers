715544,BillM,2012-07-17 23:36:00,17367,LOL!!!  Some of the giant whities I bring home from Simcoe look very similar filled with smelt/emerald shiners.

715573,danc,2012-07-18 00:52:00,4677,17 smelts in a Brook Trout is my most impressive story. Unless I include the T Bone that my co worker ate last winter in Dryden.
