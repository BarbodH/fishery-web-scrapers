716041,tomO,2012-07-19 13:51:00,363,I have an older trolling motor that was given too me. the propeller shaft is frozen so I took it apart and water had gotten into it and rusted. Can you lube the electric motor up too free it up or is it toast? thx.

716101,tomO,2012-07-19 16:51:00,363,Well I torn it apart and sprayed down good with electrical contact cleaner. then sprayed it with wd 40 let it sit for a couple of hours then started working it. It got to turning fairly easy so I put it back together hooked it up and it took off like new. So i'll see what happens when I try it out on the boat. thx.
