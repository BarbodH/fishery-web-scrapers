715777,Meely,2012-07-18 17:33:00,282,"Hello Gang,  Can anyone recommend a company they use to warranty/service their home furnaces? I am referring to the ones where you pay a fee each month and they will warranty your furnace should it break down and will even provide yearly cleanings etc. I have contacted Enbridge but they do not offer the service nor are they allowed to recommend anyone.  Secondly, can anyone recommend an licensed electrician in the Tottenham area? I have a simple job of replacing 3 or 4 ""fancy-dancey"" light switches with more simpler on/off ones. Should be a real quick easy job....... I dont ""fuddle"" with electrical.  Shoot me a PM if ya like!  Thanks for any help,  Meely"
