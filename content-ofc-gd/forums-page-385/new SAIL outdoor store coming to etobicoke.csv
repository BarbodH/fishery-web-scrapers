715784,snagged,2012-07-18 17:55:00,67,I was out buying dog food at Pet Smart across sherway gardens and noticed a sign saying SAIL outdoor store will be coming.  This is great news for me considering I'm only 5 mins away
715785,johnnyb,2012-07-18 17:57:00,3413,Nice...that'll be the closest one to me yet
715788,BillM,2012-07-18 18:14:00,17367,I'd cash in a few SAIL and BPS stores for a Cabela's.
715789,HTHM,2012-07-18 18:14:00,4082,"Funny, everyone says that the outdoors is a dying pastime, yet all these new stores are opening....  :dunno:"
715795,Stoty,2012-07-18 18:31:00,2910,    I'll be in Detroit on business all next week and I'm DEF hitting up the Dundee store!!! Can't wait!
715799,kickingfrog,2012-07-18 18:33:00,8333, I'm still hoping I can swing a trip there if I get to the winter classic.
715800,Stoty,2012-07-18 18:35:00,2910,"As a Red Wings fan... I am also in the lottery for those tickets, and yes that would be a repeat trip if that happens too! LOL  Cabela's are insane!! By far superior to anything else, IMO."
715802,snagged,2012-07-18 18:41:00,67,I've heard great things about Cabela's also.
715803,misfish,2012-07-18 18:42:00,29133, 
715814,JoshS,2012-07-18 19:24:00,729,Cabela's would be sweet. I like SAIL better the BPS however. Still nothing beats going to the small retailers if you can.
715933,musky_hunter,2012-07-19 01:51:00,328,Sail clothing sale this week. Great deals at 50% off.
715936,castgame,2012-07-19 01:55:00,161,i'd trade all the sails for a couple cabelas and more mountain equipment co-ops...
