714909,Hooked,2012-07-16 13:34:00,891,My brother is looking into buying either a 2012 Tracker Targa V-18 or a Pro Guide V-175.  Anyone here have any experience or advice I should pass on to him?

714920,Rich Clemens,2012-07-16 14:29:00,3131,"I currently have the 2010 pro guide v175.   So far, I've had no issues or Problems with it.  This is my 3rd tracker and never had a problem with the boat itself.  The only problem I,ve had us with the trailer tires.  The ones that came with it, had unusual wear problems - not due to over/under inflation.   Took a lot of phone calls and e-mails for tracker to finically admit a mfg defect and replace the tires.   The side guides are pretty cheap and I may look to get something better.    I looked at the new Targas 18' , but was really disappointed in the front casting deck.   Too me, it is way too small.   So far, I am satisfied with the boat.   Also upgraded to. A 4-stroke merc.  I've heard of others having structural problems with trackers - so far, I have not."
714922,cram,2012-07-16 14:32:00,1733,"Not sure of the model(s), but a lot of people have had hull issues with trackers.   As they say, trackers are crackers."
714977,bassassin,2012-07-16 16:53:00,152,im one of those people the hull is only covered for 5 years now because of all the problems they have had! our sentre seam gave so it had to be welded from front to back from the inside!!!!  If your a good brother you would inform him of all the issues to protect his $$$
714980,Hooked,2012-07-16 16:56:00,891," Haha, that's what I have been doing.  He has a bigger headache now, but he is steering clear of the trackers and onto more searching.  Could of possibly saved him bigger headhaches though.  Thanks everybody for your replies."
714989,Steve,2012-07-16 17:38:00,2075,"stay far away from trackers...  and for that matter, legends.  otherwise, he'll be fine!"
714991,Hooked,2012-07-16 17:42:00,891,"Any recommendations for new boat in the 25-30k range?  Would prefer something at least 17' long and a 90""+ beam.  And any marina's that maybe better than others to deal with?  Thanks."
714998,woodenboater,2012-07-16 18:20:00,2277,"I've been eyeing Lunds, Smokers, Legends and a few others so am curious why Legends should cause me to be wary. Specs look good other than the black camper top on some of their boats"
715002,Fang,2012-07-16 18:35:00,1330,Here's a link from my post about the Spring Fishing show  Larson  If I was buying anything I'd have a long look at this and try and go for a water test
715003,cityfisher,2012-07-16 18:42:00,959,"lunds, princecraft or crestliners over tracker annny day!"
715009,danbouck,2012-07-16 18:49:00,4380, They shouldn't
715019,craigdritchie,2012-07-16 19:32:00,1586,Legend is a nice boat. Never heard of anyone having a problem with one.
715038,Pigeontroller,2012-07-16 20:20:00,2793,Heard more bad stuff about Trackers and Tundras than any other make. I personally would never buy one based on what I've heard.
715039,Squid,2012-07-16 20:21:00,1656,"Legend tends to give the impression that they have a ""great"" deal for you. Selling you a boat 18' with a 40 hp. Looks like a great deal and is cheaper than anything around because of the low HP on the motor. Change that 40 to a 90 and now you have the same pricing structure as higher end boats. I did hear that Legend upped the HP because of so much pushback by customers.So in lieu of the 40HP they give you a 60."
715044,kickingfrog,2012-07-16 20:30:00,8333,Other boats will also list a price based on a motor towards the bottom end of the horsepower limit.
715046,Squid,2012-07-16 20:36:00,1656,Yes but to the extent that Legend does(did). My brother has had his 18 footer for 10 yrs and is very happy with it.
715047,Squid,2012-07-16 20:38:00,1656,And if you work for Legend and post on here (this thread) then its a bit of a biased opinion.
715076,spincast,2012-07-16 21:38:00,3279,"Bought a used 16 foot Starfire and love it. When its time to move up, likely be a Starcraft then too."
715147,hookerdown,2012-07-17 00:55:00,110,"My dad, brother (bassassin) and I own a Fisher (made by Tracker) and we had a few problems with them.  As my brother said the centreline weld cracked, we discuoved the crack 3 months after the warranty expired.  The service we got from Tracker and BPS was horrible.  Its to the point I won't spend another penny at BPS.  I did research through this and discovered that Tracker/Fisher are known for having problems with their welds, to the point where they are commonly referred to Crackers.  While installing downriggers I noticed that some of the screws missed supporting beams, the wiring harnesses are a cluster %uck, even how they install their radios is done half ass.  I wouldn't buy another one.  Tell your brother to do a Google search on Tracker cracked hull or Fisher cracked hull, there will be some interesting stories about Tracker's service and common problems.  Also tell your brother to look for a boat with a thick hull and quality ""wood free"" floor.  I don't think I would be another welded hull.  When a Rivet breaks, its just a matter of drill the rivit out and installing another rivit, as opposed to an expensive re-weld."
715148,gordy28,2012-07-17 01:03:00,638,"My post goes against the grain and perhaps we have just been lucky thus far but.. We have an 18.5 foot tracker targa-anniversary edition-no hull or major problem thus far A few things though-things like cup holders, rod storage etc were cheaply made-they fell out etc-not if you'd have the same issues with a Lund etc Customer service at BPS service (where we bought the boat) was bad- enough that my Dad lost the ""heed"" as we Scots would say and we have never been back. Boat does however run amazing and is a smooth ride even in rough water Cheers G"
715152,Hooked,2012-07-17 01:21:00,891,"Well the only good thing is if he goes with the Targa, he won't have to deal with BPS or Tracker directly, but the place where he may buy it from.  I think my brother just picked a bad time to buy a boat, pickings are slim. I provided him with a lot of info, thanks in large parts to you folks, and he can make the decision himself.  What ever he goes for I hope it works out for him.  Thanks for info everybody."
715165,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-17 01:45:00,540,"Honestly, call Marsh,s marina.  I searched for a boat for YEARS and these guys treated me the best!  You can get a sweet boat for that price.  Tell them what you want and what you are willing to pay.  They also deal with Suzuki motors which are bullet proof!"
715166,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-17 01:47:00,540,"Forgot to mention.  For that price, check out the Smokercraft proangler.  Sweet boat!"
