714663,Cudz,2012-07-15 13:42:00,2652,"I have used fireline before in both the black(smoke or whatever) and crystal. I find it to be very stong but does not cast like pp.  I am a regular PP user but both the crystal and regular and tracer braid is on for $15 at CTC. I have a bunch of CTC money so I was wondering which is better?  The smoke, the crystal or tracer braid.  The tracer braid looks so bright I can't see myself using it. Chime in here especially if you are a regular fireline user."
714677,Jigger,2012-07-15 14:51:00,1237,Ive been using the Crystal this season for Senkos and jerkbaits. No problems thus far. Its very easy to watch the line as its lying on the water. I got away from pp altogether unless its real high test for my muskie rigs.

714685,NAW,2012-07-15 15:26:00,4022,"Had my first break off yesterday with Fireline Black.  Totally my fault though.  Very old line, which should have been changed.  I use both the Crystal and Black.  6 1/12 12 of the other..  They're both decent lines.  I prefer the black personally, and usually only use the crystal in the winter."

714725,MCTFisher9120,2012-07-15 21:18:00,3761,"I use the Tracer Braid on my Spinning reels. Works well tying baits to the ""low vis"" spots and having the bright yellow is a plus. Casts well also.  When it comes to baitcasters I have some Super Slick braids and Sunline FC braids spooled up. All work well."
714761,Garry2Rs,2012-07-15 23:20:00,1425,"The Tracer is a much better line than the old fused black or crystal. Tracer is braided using 8 strands and is round and smooth.  Like all braids the flashy paint soon wears off.  I don't think bass mind the bright end, but if your worried, perhaps a leader might be in order."
715117,mike rousseau,2012-07-16 23:49:00,4661,I use hi vis yellow in original fireline for jigging walleye and love it... Walleye aren't bothered either...
715131,hirk,2012-07-17 00:13:00,571,"Tracer braid is a true braid (comes in green too),the only thing it has in common with fireline is the name they are two different lines."
715155,EC1,2012-07-17 01:27:00,930,"Tracer worked great for me. Not sure why tracer feels softer compared to the fireline braid. Fireline Braid on the other hand, has given me quite a bit of trouble... It sometimes decides to knot up into a huge ball that I can undo(Only on a spinning reel - feels almost like line twist), but not a fun experience when you're trying to catch fish.  Just my opinion...I used tracer about 2 years ago and was really happy with it, but am dealing with 30 and 50# fireline braid right now. Not so bad with baitcasters though."
