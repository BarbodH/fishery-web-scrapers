713200,bucktail,2012-07-10 01:20:00,1857,After kissing the bottom in Geo bay last week I think its time for a new prop. Mine has been fixed 3 times but its getting pretty thin now.  I know Michigan propellers has good prices but is there an Ontario guy who has good prices out there?  Just a new aluminum prop for my 2004 90hp Yamaha   Any help would be appreciated.!    darren
713204,Sebastian,2012-07-10 01:23:00,208,I am also needing one. Same motor and year. Was wondering the same...

713220,scugpg,2012-07-10 02:24:00,1373,I've had good luck with my turning point propeller was very reasonable
713247,UglyBug,2012-07-10 05:43:00,148,"Just search Google for Kawartha propeller repair shop. It's part of buckhorn marina. They do really sweet work. Not sure they sell new. They did my Tempest 23 could not tell,it had been tipped "

713264,ColdH20guy,2012-07-10 11:58:00,312,"  http://www.unitedpropeller.ca/  in Orillia never dealt with them directly, but I know a couple guys who have and loved them.."

713388,fish_fishburn,2012-07-10 17:46:00,1311,Kawartha Propellers does a fine job and quick turnaround.
714169,bucktail,2012-07-13 01:29:00,1857,Thanks guys  i have lost 5 miles an hour and a slight vibration so I guess its time!!
714170,strik,2012-07-13 01:33:00,175,  just got my old  prop  fixed what a great guy and great prices  i will deal with him again (price even included shipping to my door)
714221,davey buoy,2012-07-13 09:58:00,5505," Louis a great guy,and does nice work for sure. Can't beat his pricing."
714315,captpierre,2012-07-13 16:39:00,2521,I see lots of SS props out there but in my mind can't justify the huge difference in cost and inability to repair them.  Is the performance that much better?
714317,Spiel,2012-07-13 16:53:00,9065,"Make a phone call to Bay City Marine Darren (905-574-1222 ), they sell Yamahas.  I got a spare aluminium prop for my 2006, 75 Merc off them a few years ago for $100.00 though I did bargain with them for it."
714324,Terry,2012-07-13 17:13:00,14456," yes  and I have had SS props repaired  I am very hard on props, I have broken or bent aluminum props on wood and hard ground , it takes a rock to hurt my SS, so for me the cost balances out and I have better performance"
714325,BillM,2012-07-13 17:15:00,17367,"I'd rather sacrifice my prop then my lower unit if something bad ever happens.  I'll stick to aluminum.. 50mph is fast enough for me, lol."
714326,Court R,2012-07-13 17:17:00,213,"I have ordered a few from theses guy's, but there out of the states..http://www.ptprop.com/"
714340,CRUD150,2012-07-13 17:59:00,87,  What he said.
714346,Terry,2012-07-13 18:17:00,14456,never had the lower unit break because of the prop  but isn't that the reason for insurance
714526,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 16:39:00,5865, That all depends on how old your boat is.........I haven't had boat insurance on my vessel for over 15 years now......that insurance payment buys a lot of props and a lot of other fishing equipment....
714527,Terry,2012-07-14 16:43:00,14456,yup right up to the point that it sinks  had a fiend say the same about house insurance  and man did he save hundreds and hundreds    I think he is living on the street now
714531,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 16:55:00,5865, Well that's pretty stupid.........houses appreciate over time....boats DEPRECIATES once you take possession of it......who insures a 20 year old or OLDER boat......I don't....mine now 27 years old....but my home owners will cover it up to a point......and that's FREE...my favorite four letter word...
