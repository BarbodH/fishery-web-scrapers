715988,bucktail,2012-07-19 12:13:00,1857,The photo gallery doesnt seem to be working the last couple days for me.   Has anyone else had any luck uploading photos to it??  Darren
715989,Jer,2012-07-19 12:24:00,1426,"I had trouble a couple weeks ago. Wouldn't load at first, when i did get on it wouldn't show any thumbnails.  I went to Photobucket, much easier all around."
715991,Roy,2012-07-19 12:24:00,13728,"The gallery got hacked a while back and we're still working to get it running properly. As far as I know, it's working now but the thumbnails aren't showing."
715992,Spiel,2012-07-19 12:26:00,9065,"Nope, still not working Roy, I've been able to access my photos but can't upload any."
