715339,ehg,2012-07-17 15:16:00,2666,Great stuff there Jacques.  Eating them fish is what it was all about.
715341,Leecher,2012-07-17 15:22:00,7832," Thanks Will!!!  No problem, if you ever come up this way, I'll be glad to bring you to lake X   Thanks Erik!!!  You are so right my friend!  After a little bit of work and some driving, reward is so sweet"
715387,Moosebunk,2012-07-17 17:27:00,3970,Perfect panners Jacques.  Wicked fishing.  If my girls were just a little younger they'd have an aneurysm from the excitement of watching those little fish heads fry in the pan.
715504,Leecher,2012-07-17 21:25:00,7832," Thanks Drew!!!  More like ""Wicked Phenomenal"" how we felt yesterday in the brunt of it     When it was all said and done, asked him if he wanted to have another shot at them and his reply was.... well can't say it here   but we are working on another session"
715035,Leecher,2012-07-16 20:13:00,7832,"My good lord, what a session we had this morning   Brother in law and I got talking yesterday about going out to one of our local lakes for specks... told him to pick me up at 6h00am and bring a lunch.... no need to bring his fishing gear as I have everything covered   Spirits were high since he never caught a brookie before and that I was able to limit out my last time out  Well, to my surprise, even in this hot weather, the beauties were hungry  But first the details    We left my place at 5h45am, a couple of pit stops and the way we go.... destination North bound   Got to destination around 7h30am, got the first rod setup & ready for him, proceeded to setup my rod, when from the corner of my eye see the rod tip twitch    Say to him... you got a HIT  He tells me.... what??? didn't see it   I say ""SET THE HOOK""   He lands he first brookie   I get the fish unhooked and put it in the cooler, put another worm on, cast out and give him the rod  So I proceeded to resume setting up my rod again but he gets another hit, sets the hook and lands his second    I get the fish off the hook, put it in the cooler and.... well you get the picture    this went on for a while....  fast forward.... by then, he was 5 specks ahead and I hadn't setup my rod yet  Finally got mine setup   the action was none stop until we each reach our limit   At 10h00am we were done    Due to me acting as a guide on this outing, wasn't able to snap any pics while this was occuring    but was able to get this one back at home... the one and only.... the sync shot    Lures of choice was: slip bobber type rig that I make tip with dew worm All in all, fish for 2.5hrs, drove for 3.5hrs and each limit out Hope you enjoy Tight lines Now I'm exhausted and need a cold brew TJunkie"

Good luck on your brookie session... hope there's still hungry when you target them! Your right about the season... it's a short one.   I wouldn't keep a limit if they were native trout... those are all stocked... everyone of them had fins clipped"
715221,GreenCanada,2012-07-17 04:56:00,375,"I gotta say they do look tasty! 8-10"" are perfect for breakfast"
