712015,Pigeontroller,2012-07-05 21:47:00,2793,When I was out in May with the MNR Bios checking trap nets for Muskie I saw some incredible Smallies!!! Several 5-6 lbers!
712021,Ron,2012-07-05 22:34:00,1683,"I launched out of Coldwater, (Black Lake). Go through the stump mines and into Gloucster Pool. Fishing is great. So great that if you don't catch a muskie within the first 37 seconds of casting, you must be in the wrong spot!    This was the only time I have fished this lake and seriously, I pulled up to a spot that looked like it had potential. First cast with a twitch/slash bait, third pull and that is what I was rewarded with. A good number of Pike as well as Bass can be caught. Not difficult to find your preferred structure to fish."
712095,bigbuck,2012-07-06 02:55:00,2449,Beautiful body of water. I am planning on going thru the locks early one day and hitting GPool for some skis.
712106,skdds,2012-07-06 04:13:00,195," Nice Ski!, I am also headed back to the pool, never had any problem with bass-few reports on here.., but have come up short on pike and muskie, what kind of structure in gloucester pool will hold good pike and maybe a muskie this time of year? are they deep? shallow?-skdds"
712116,workwear,2012-07-06 09:17:00,592,thanks everyone for thier input....   especially the guys who put me onto the search feature....hehe..
712136,BillM,2012-07-06 11:57:00,17367," Fish the deeper weed edges 10-20ft, you'll have no problems finding pike.  I put one in the boat last weekend around 36inches.  No monster by any means but a nice fish for that lake."

712406,skdds,2012-07-07 02:44:00,195, thanks! will give it try-skdds
715578,skdds,2012-07-18 01:06:00,195,"Back from Gloucester Pool... Thanks to the advice on this thread I nailed this nice pike! right along the weedlines. The pool also gave up some great smallmouth bass-got them on my usual spinner rigs and drop shots,but also slip bobbers-a new technique for me that worked well and was a lot of fun. All on plastics, no live bait this year. My wife caught her first ""nice"" bass-light line and rod so she had a great fight! lots of fun for me and the kids to watch the action. Water temps were really warm (81degrees!) A few guys I spoke to did really well for largemouth with topwaters.  Highlight of the the week? Also nailed my first musky while trolling for more pike....took all the advice from you guys-good rod and reel, 80lb test braid and strong leader-had the incidentals as well if needed. Got the fish to the side of the boat but unfortunately did not land it as I was alone and could not get it into the net safely.  It was a good size though, hard fight-felt like I was trying to bring up an SUV from the bottom of the lake. The fish broke the hook itself and then swam off with lots of energy--a good release I guess!  If you have not fished the pool you should check it out, a beautiful shield lake, lots of structure, not far from T.O (1.5hours) and not too much boat traffic..during the week that is. -skdds  "
715586,NAW,2012-07-18 01:37:00,4022,"I was on the G-Pool last weekend as well for the first time.  Like others have mentioned earlier in this thread.  Possibly one of the most pressured lakes I personally have ever fished my in my entire life.  Every ""fishy"" spot that I pulled up to had at least 1, sometime 2 or 3 other boats fishing there.  Keep in mind there was a Jr bass tournament last weekend, but there was only 10 boats entered.  I must have seen easily 100 other fisherman on the lake that day.  Fishing was great for the first 2 hours of the day, then it died down when it got really hot out."
715587,livinisfishin,2012-07-18 01:39:00,661,Nice fish!
715604,skdds,2012-07-18 03:01:00,195,"  I did not have that problem during the weekdays, weekends? different story, very busy but not anglers..  "
715652,BillM,2012-07-18 11:33:00,17367,I've stopped fishing during the weekends unless I'm fishing salmon..  Way to much fishing pressure and boating/jetski'ing going on for me..  I'll stick to weekday evenings..  Glad you got into some fish!
