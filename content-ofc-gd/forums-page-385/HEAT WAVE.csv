715464,Spiel,2012-07-17 19:58:00,9065," Can't even compare to standing on the floor of a hot rolling mill turning bars with tongs and feeding the next mill, long johns required to keep your skin from burning.  Not to mention working next to the iron runner in the blast furnace or next to a steel making vessel wearing heavy heat reflective clothing."
