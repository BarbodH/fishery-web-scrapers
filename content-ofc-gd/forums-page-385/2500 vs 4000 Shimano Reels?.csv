715824,JoshS,2012-07-18 20:02:00,729,"The reel you buy all depends on what kind of fishing you're doing. You say you mostly fish pike - pike require bigger lures - then I'd go with the 4000.  4000 is not ideal for most applications for bass, walleye etc but for pike, 4000 is a better bet. I wouldn't worry about casting distance.  If you spend a lot of time fishing bass, walleye, panfish, trout, I'd get a 2500 because it is a better all round size. But for pike only, get a 4000."
715830,jedimaster,2012-07-18 20:09:00,3472," Yes, bring I have a 7 Foot heav XF compre in Spinning and casting. Both with 50 pound power pro, one with the symetre 4000 and one with a curado. Tried a dhsv 200 and an E. The symetre out casts both by a fair bit."

715956,Bernie66,2012-07-19 04:04:00,123,4000 reels usually have larger internal gears.  Larger gears translates to more cranking power and thats definitely something you want if you are retrieving large lures.

716029,smally21,2012-07-19 13:19:00,993,"if you wanted more cranking power and retreival speed, wouldn't you switch to a baitcaster? i would have thought so, but dont really know..."
716037,Bernie66,2012-07-19 13:42:00,123,"Even with baitcasters, the larger reels tend to have more cranking power.  Also, the burners with 7:1 ratio will have less power than the slower 5:1 reels."
715554,hotsky,2012-07-18 00:03:00,400,"I just picked up a Shimano Symetre 2500FJ reel and wondering if I should've gotten a 4000 one instead. The reason I went with 2500 is because of the lower weight, but (never used a 4000 so) not sure if I'm missing out. I use spinners and spoons a lot and thinking that with a larger diameter reel it would be less work cranking them in and would be able to do it faster.  Also I have a feeling that larger reel will cast farther. Or am I wrong? If I'm not, than faster/easier retrieve and extra distance will be worth putting up with little extra weight.  Should I keep the 2500 or exchange it for 4000 model??"
715555,danjang,2012-07-18 00:12:00,148,"It depends on what # line you'll be using. A 4000 reel will hold a lot of line. Casting distance won't be affected unless you underspool the reel. In terms of cranking, it's probably negligible. I have 4 2500 and they hold more than enough line for chucking spoons for salmon. A 4000 reel will just limit it's capabilities and you'll be forced to spend more money on line."

715565,salmon,2012-07-18 00:35:00,334,"IMO I would keep the 2500 series reel and look for 3000 series spare spools. There should be some on e-bay. That's what I did, now I can switch to the 2500 series spool for smaller stuff and the 3000 series spool for pier fishing. Hope this helps"
715566,pike slayer,2012-07-18 00:37:00,1177,i use shimano 2500s and they hold more then enough line for any type of fish in ontario and are light and comfortable. for the average general purpose fishing rod the 2500 is the way to go.
715567,hotsky,2012-07-18 00:39:00,400,Why is larger spool better for pier fishing?
715579,GreenCanada,2012-07-18 01:08:00,375,"I have a 2500 spooled with 10lb mono and it casts plenty far enough for salmon pier fishing with spoons, spinners, cranks, etc.  Great reel for the price point!"
715580,GreenCanada,2012-07-18 01:10:00,375,I just wanted to add that you should buy a spare 2500 spool for line variety or as a back up. Worth the 20 bucks.
715583,craigdritchie,2012-07-18 01:31:00,1586,"I use mainly 2000 or 2500 series reels (along with Daiwa 1300s) for most freshwater fishing. It's the right size and weight.  That said, I do use a 4000 series reel for chucking spoons off the pier. The bigger spool gives a bit more line capacity, and is a bit wider in diameter so I get a few extra yards of casting distance. I seldom pier fish for more than three or four hours at a time, so the extra weight is not an issue - not as it would be if you were holding it all day.  The only other time I ever use a 4000 reel is for special circumstances where I need extra casting range with lightweight lures. I have one spot where I can catch really big smallmouth, but it demands casting small, lightweight topwaters (Heddon Tiny Torpedos) a very long distance. Water is super shallow and super clear in this spot, so I'm only using 6 pound line. It flies off the big spool, and gives me probably an extra 30 - 40 feet, which can make a big difference some days."
715584,eman,2012-07-18 01:33:00,101,"What kind of line do you use? The larger spool will produce less line twist and nesting, especially with fluoro. Another trick to save on line cost is to spool have your reel with cheaper mono. I usually use 8lb big game for about 50 or 60 yards, tie A double uni knot, then spool the rest with better quality braid or fluoro."
715588,bigbuck,2012-07-18 01:40:00,2449,"The reason you need a big spool when pier fishing for salmon is that a big salmon can really peel off a lot of line when it goes for a run. A couple of hundred yards isn't unheard of. General purpose, 2500, salmon oFf the pier, 4000. I hope that helps."
715589,Bernie66,2012-07-18 01:42:00,123,"If you are pier fishing for lake O salmon with spoons, go with the 4000.  You can easily get spooled with a 2500 if you happen to foul hook a large chinny.  Seen it happen a few times at Port Hope and at the Whirlpool.  Also, the 4000 balances alot better with the heavier longer pier rods (9-11ft).  I have a 11ft Raven Specialist and a 10ft Shimano Convergence both matched with 4000 series reels.  2500s on those rods will make them feel very tip heavy."
715603,jedimaster,2012-07-18 03:01:00,3472,I have some 2500's and a 4000 rear drag symetre. I like them all. I use the 4000 for throwing gs for bass and lighter musky stuff. With a heavy action rod it works really welll. Super long casts and loads of line capacity. When I throw frog I like to bomb them out real far.
715605,jedimaster,2012-07-18 03:03:00,3472,"Also there is a bit more drag power, as well you can crank a bit better with the longer handle on bigger fish. I wouldn't dream of trying to real in amusky with a 2500 but the 4000 has brought in a number of fish without issue. I know some musky guys will complain at that but this is my experience."
715606,JoshS,2012-07-18 03:09:00,729,"I didn't know you could get 3000 spools on 2500 reels!! Didn't even think of that!  To the OP: 2500 is the best all round size for general fishing. I'd keep that if you're just starting out. Once you find yourself getting more into the sport, you'll get a baitcasting reel for bigger lures and want a few reels in the 2500 size."
715611,kickingfrog,2012-07-18 03:29:00,8333,"The rear drag reels (2500 v 4000) have much less difference in drag size, if any, compared to front drag reels ( 2500 v 4000). And if drag is a serious concern the front drag is the best option period."
715625,hotsky,2012-07-18 04:23:00,400,"  So I was right after all! I already have a 2500 Sienna ($35 reel) that I'll be keeping, but wanted to upgrade and get a new rod as well (7'1"" Abu Garcia Villian). I got Symetre because at that price point I figured it will be a step up so I don't have to spend more money on another reel anytime soon. I fish for pike mostly and especially now when it's hot would like to be able to get the lures as far out there as I can. Extra distance would be quite welcome. If it makes 10m difference (as mentioned in the previous post - which is a lot!) that alone might be worth putting up with the weight. I also find it most tiresome to quickly retrieve large spinners, over and over, that create a lot of resistance in the water, so again if larger reel cranks faster that would save me some energy. Oh and I do want to try musky fishing with it later this fall...hmmm"
715629,Ben_Daniels,2012-07-18 05:07:00,435,Without much research I bought a 4000 Shimano reel because I assumed that the larger spool would give me more feet of line retrieved per turn of the handle. Which it does but only by 2 inches http://www.basspro.com/Shimano-Symetre-Front-Drag-Spinning-Reels/product/102360/90736 . In retrospect I wish I had gotten the 2500.
715637,adempsey,2012-07-18 06:04:00,1498,"Did you look at the 3000?  I think that's what you want.  It's the same weight and gear ratio as the 2500, but holds more line and has the same drag as the 4000.  http://www.shimano.com/publish/content/global_fish/en/us/index/products/reels/spinning/Symetre_FL.html  I have two 3000's.  I use these set-ups for casting cranks/spoons and trolling.  The 2500's I use for everything, but mostly jigging, slip bobbers and lighter lures."
715661,smally21,2012-07-18 12:13:00,993,"before reading this post i never would go with a spinner over 2500, in fact i use a 1500 most of the time. but some very interesting points have been brought up regarding pier fishing/line weights, balance, etc.  i think the baitcaster takes care of every situation where i would need a larger spinning reel. when i was a kid we had giant clunker reels im guessing it was availability or cost..but looking back why did we perch fish with 4000 reels?"
715664,lew,2012-07-18 12:20:00,12766,"I haven't used a spinning reel for several years now, but the 2 I've got are both 4000 series. I only ever used them for trolling for pickeral and they worked well for that. Maybe it's just me but I just always felt the larger reels were more comfortable to hold."
715667,Live2fish85,2012-07-18 12:33:00,1633,I don't use Shimano spinning reels but with my pfluegers which I have a 30 and a 35 I have never noticed a difference in casting distance. I just notice the 35 is to large for most of my fishing and holds more line.  I would stay with the 2500.
715690,torco,2012-07-18 13:34:00,656,"I am shimano guy and have the stradic in the 2500 and 4000 series. Similar to most I basically use the 2500 series for most fishing and the 4000 is really more of a specialist vs. a generalist reel if I can use the phrase.  Right now I have my 2500 series spooled with 6 and 8lbs mono. The 4000 series is spooled with 10lbs mono and 20lbs powerpro which is almost exclusively used for salmon off the piers. I have been spooled on the 2500 series but never on the 4000 series.  I also find that once the diameter of the line is over 8lbs test mono that I like the bigger reel, just my personal preference."
715696,jedimaster,2012-07-18 13:46:00,3472," I have been using a baitcaster for a number of years and have used all sorts of good and cheap ones, but a spinning real will out cast a baitcaster. Thats why I use the 4000 for frog fishing. Alot of times you just can't get the boat as deep into the weeds as you want. a big spinning real and a long spining rod will help you get the extra oompf when you want it. Other than that Yah, if I want lots of line on the spool its a baitcaster."
