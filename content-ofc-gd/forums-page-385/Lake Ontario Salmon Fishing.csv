714899,Fish Farmer,2012-07-16 12:56:00,2234,Great report Bob and for eats you hit it on the head except I throw a few Speckies on the list of eats.
714993,Billy Bob,2012-07-16 17:48:00,5865, And I forgot to mention CRAPPIE.......they are the VERY BEST eating fish IMHO....
715520,skeeter,2012-07-17 22:36:00,1907,Way to go Billy Bob !!!  Nice fish and great report!
714476,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 13:20:00,5865,"I haven't been on Lake Ontario for a while, being a perch and walleye guy....but my perch/walleye fishing buddy kept hounding me to tag along on a trip he set up with a friend that runs a charter boat out of Rochester, NY......that's a 1.5 hour ride from my house but I said OK.......then he calls me and says the 4th guy dropped out and could I get someone to make the 4th guy...one call to my high school buddy John and he was in if he could get the day off......that was no problem....with Don living in Lockport and John and I living only 3 miles away we met up with Don and his youngest son Adam at the Genesee River at 5:15am.....not much sleep that night......  So we started trolling straight out of the river at 80 feet and it was constant action......we lost quite a few half way in or right after they hit....twice we had a triple header on, but only landed the 3 at once one time...the first time I lost a horse after having it on for about 5 minutes ...it came to the surface and rolled about 50-60 feet from the boat....but I did make up for that on the last fish of the day....it was Mr Ed, weighing in at 28 lbs....largest fish of the day....I also got the largest Steelhead....so a GREAT day to be on the water.....waves never broke 6"" and most times FLAT CALM.....  So I'll just let the pics do the rest of the story....        We weren't sure what the official total fish count was so the first mate Matt took them all out of the coolers and spread them out on the deck...also made a good opportunity to photo them.....well the count was 11 fish and while everyone was taking pics the far left rod that was a dipsy on wire sprang into action....  It was yours truely turn.......it was a heavy fish and wouldn't quit....with the peanut gallery  behind me warning me this could be a limit.....DON'T lose it, I fought it with caution.....nearly 6 minutes later we got a good look at this horse ""MR. ED"" he was named......but now he wanted to run under the boat.....LOTS of pressure on the rod kept him from doing that....and a minute or two later he came to the net... "
714480,Live2fish85,2012-07-14 13:33:00,1633,Nice work BB. That last one is a beauty. Almost beats Lake Erie perch and walleye.
714483,woodenboater,2012-07-14 13:37:00,2277,"What a great day on the water there BB and you guys boated some very nice ones.  btw, is the Genesee still a bit murky"
714487,Spiel,2012-07-14 13:46:00,9065,Awesome!
714488,BillM,2012-07-14 13:46:00,17367,Who eating those giants things?  LOL
714496,fishnsled,2012-07-14 14:02:00,3520,Very nice BB!!!
714508,SlowPoke,2012-07-14 15:18:00,2984,After a day like that I often wonder how anybody could go back to perch and walleye fishing. I guess I'd have to be a fish eater to appreciate it. Great pic's and post.
714509,Live2fish85,2012-07-14 15:25:00,1633,  I agree lol. I hate fishing perch and walleye. Only good thing about them is taste lol.
714536,esoxansteel,2012-07-14 17:09:00,1307,Should be some nice tight skein in a few of those
714558,Billy Bob,2012-07-14 19:48:00,5865, They have been filleted and steaked.....vacuum pack and now frozen solid to take to my daughter in-law in Cortland.......she loves salmon.....I like to smoke it so a couple packages will stay here.....once smoked we make a mean fish dip with it....great for parties.  Bob
714563,Gerritt,2012-07-14 20:06:00,6129,Nice fish!  But Ewwwww and Yuck for consuming them.... their flesh is not good at all.... especially at that size... more pale orange then pink would be by guess....   YUCK!  G
714574,Skipper D,2012-07-14 21:35:00,1970,"Way ta go Billy Bob , nice looking fish for sure ."
714590,davey buoy,2012-07-14 22:44:00,5505,What a great day you had!!!!.Nice to know the skipper/captain knows where to find them.
714591,spincast,2012-07-14 22:51:00,3279,"those are the days us Lake O addicts live for. Sweet day on the water BB. For us anything over 24"" is back to catch again unless its too far gone to revive  - but when you're paying for a charter it sure nice to take a little more than memories and pictures home at the end of the day.. Smoked, bbq or fried, nothing like today's fish. As for perch fishin - well, that's one I just don't get.  Way too much work in and out of the boat for that meal.  Each to his own"
714592,bassman87,2012-07-14 22:58:00,586, ok princess
714593,bassman87,2012-07-14 23:00:00,586,"if someone wants to eat it then let them eat it. why make them feel bad about doing so. besides, that dip does sound badass billy b"
714599,Billy Bob,2012-07-15 00:02:00,5865," And it's very easy to make........PAY ATTENTION....you hear me BillyM..LOL  After smoking. cool fish and put in the FRIDGE......not the freezer..  The day you are entertaining.....that means you have guest over...and you feed them....LOL................take the cold smoked fish and chop it up like tuna fish.......then add some Ranch Dressing.....make it the way you like...dry or not so dry....then add a little chopped onion......and put it back in the fridge....  Now get some more chopped onion, chopped hot peppers, sweet peppers, tomatoes and some nice crackers.........put the fish dip in the middle and surround it with all the condiments.....other condiments could be olives, pickles or whatever.....this has always been a great hit at all my deck parties....almost as good as my secret BBQ SHRIMP....ask Big Cliff or Simon about that recipe...."
714604,bassman87,2012-07-15 00:25:00,586,any good recipes for atlantic salmon from the credit?
714607,Billy Bob,2012-07-15 00:36:00,5865, YES.......but I don't think your serious...so I wouldn't bother.
