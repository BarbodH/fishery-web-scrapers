715068,Billy Bob,2012-07-16 21:27:00,5865, GUYS......FELLOW FISHERMEN.......lets not paint all fishermen with that BROAD brush that is NOT ALLOWED if we were to single out a class of folks.......  Just like when you read that a few crazy people went nuts at the concert last night....are all concert folks nuts or drunks or rowdy ????? of course not.....but here on this site we regularly hang each other then stick up for each other....divide and conquer is the best way to defeat us sportsmen.....
715099,Snidley,2012-07-16 22:57:00,620,"I find these types of post amusing in a pathetic sort of way. Many of the same guys that find this act of wasting 3 small Bass a shameful travesty that should be harshly punished, and they are right of course, would consider retaining the biggest of big Kings(or 5)  for ""the Derby"" to be righteous harvest in a lame attempt to cash a cheque. Tens of thousands of big salmon, including the very biggest fish, are slaughtered so a very few anglers, an even smaller number of charter captains and one despicable family  business can profit. The derby anglers along with roe anglers kill tens of thousands of much scarcer animals for what can only be considered the most colossal waste of a resource in this province. All with a nod and a wink that this is ok and that (the wasted Bass) is horrible. In fact it's the same thing with the caveat that the the slaughter of our pelagic s is massive and most anglers rightly catch and release Bass. Think it over before rationalizing your behaviors or pointing fingers."
715100,UglyBug,2012-07-16 23:03:00,148,With comments like those I suspect this post is going to get really interesting really fast.

715114,smally21,2012-07-16 23:48:00,993,"it is interesting that guys posing with suspended stringers of giant walleye is OK, massive coolers full of perch dumped all over the boat or front lawn is OK, a wheelbarrow full of lake erie bass from the opener is OK..but 3 bass on a riverbank is the worst thing ever.  one is wasted, the other enjoyed of course, and the pics are of legally obtained fish so no harm there...  i agree, BTW, with the original post of course and find the act disgraceful, but i can see another point being made during the thread."
715122,mercman,2012-07-16 23:55:00,7054,"Opinions are a dime a dozen.Fact. It is forbidden to allow a caught fish, fit for human consumption, to rot. It is this law that the OP witnessed being broken, and i am in complete agreement with him. All the other banter in this thread not pertaining to the original subject is irrelevant. "

Second if we stick to the original topic many of the threads on this board would not end up being locked, if you want to comment on another issue start your own thread.  To comment on a few of the earlier posts  No walleye within 40 km of this body of water   so shouldn""t have been a surpride they were catching bass  Never thougth to get the plate number as I never dreamt this is what they were doing and by the time  I found them they were long gone. Never considered taking them home to eat because a dog was munching on the other pile I did not photo so lord only knows what was on these fish  One of these days I will figure out how to quote so you know who I am responding to LOL  Thanks for all the comments    Ian"

715250,craigdritchie,2012-07-17 12:07:00,1586,"Bob,  I didn't say all fishermen. But I did say a huge number of fishermen, and I absolutely stand by that. Go visit any popular fishing spot and what do you see on the ground? Old styrofoam worm containers, discarded paper coffee cups, coils of old, dead fishing line, lure packaging. We've all seen scenes like this countless times. And, there are places like that all over the country. It's not just an isolated thing confined to a handful of ignorant people. It's a bigger problem that exists on a broad scale.  Sorry to say it folks, but it is the truth. If we want to continue to have access to water in the future, this kind of behaviour - the littering and leaving dead fish all over - needs to stop.  This isn't about divide and conquer. It's about admitting we collectively have a problem in our group. Isn't the first step in solving a problem to admit it even exists? Sweeping it under a rug won't help."
715258,UglyBug,2012-07-17 12:26:00,148,"Sorry Craig but there not part of my group. I hang out with people who are clean, respectful of others, and would never participate in this type of behavior. Not sure what group you hang out with."
715262,lew,2012-07-17 12:32:00,12766," Craig never said it was HIS group that was causing the mess, he was talking about a large group of people in general.  Didn't seem to me to be that hard to understand"
715265,BillM,2012-07-17 12:34:00,17367, Read his reply again.
715267,UglyBug,2012-07-17 12:36:00,148,It's about admitting we collectively have a problem in our group    Enough said    
715271,Harrison,2012-07-17 12:41:00,2202, You should see who Craig hangs out with.  Especially his past chums.  All loogans. Craig should read more on the internet and get really knowledgable about fishing.
715277,Rod Caster,2012-07-17 12:49:00,5784,"  Absolutely agree. People are generally bad behaving until they learn otherwise.  Until I litterally yelled at a guy for chucking a can of beans into the lake this weekend, the other ""newbies"" would have followed suit. After that they were all embarassed to do stupid things because they knew I'd snap, swim for the can of beans and put it in their pillow case. Their sense of ownership and love of the lake was very high afterwards...but they would not have taken that path without some pressure. This "" do what I want until someone catches me"" attitude is extremely prevalent. Needs to be addressed accordingly...South or North."

714787,nroadrunner,2012-07-16 00:22:00,113,"Went down to the Dam this evening to teach my 8 year old how to cast with a spinning reel and also to cool down a little.  A couple were already fishing our favorite spot so we moved 100 yards or so down shore and fished there.  The other couple were having some success no monsters but catching fish.  They left 20 minutes after we arrived and we decided to move up to where they were fishing.  It looked to me that they were keeping some fish which i have no problem with even if the biggest looked to be about 11 inches or so.  Upon arriving at the spot they were fishing I found out that they were indeed keeping the fish.  Problem was they were keeping them out of the water to die not to take home and eat as this is what they left behind.      There were at least 4 other fish 3 smallmouth 1 rock bass also left on shore to rot.  People like this piss me off.  Why bother fishing? These are the fish keep our fishery healthy.  The couple looked to be between 50 and 65 years old so  I can't even blame it on immaturity due to age.  My 8 year old was really ticked off at this he kept asking me why they would do it, and I had no logical answer for him that didn't involve swear words.    Well that's my rant thanks for letting me vent    Ian"
714791,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-07-16 00:30:00,310,They were probably fishing for walleye and were annoyed by all the dink bass that they were catching. Bass are what you catch by accident while fishing for every other species.
714793,Default User,2012-07-16 00:39:00,72,"I've seen this before too. Young ppl though, trying to prove it wasn't the same fish they kept catching and releasing.  They later threw the remaining of their minnows into the water before they left"
714796,LefroyFisherman,2012-07-16 00:46:00,602,That's just sad! people like this shouldn't be allowed to fish.
714802,mercman,2012-07-16 00:51:00,7054,  I know............Joking right? No fish should be left to rot on the bank like that.Not even walleye I bet they didnt even have a license  to fish.
714803,Rod Caster,2012-07-16 00:51:00,5784,"Yup, no logic at all. The same as this morning when a couple guys wanted to bonk a 12lbs pike even though they don't even like eating fish. I also got chastized for quickly releasing a big fish instead of waiting for a camera. In the end, I managed to educate a few guys on how to catch and care for fish."

714882,UglyBug,2012-07-16 11:49:00,148,I am a BASS fisherman and PROUD of it......  People who destroy natural resources like this are a disgrace to all fisherman and should be jailed. However sadly people like this are to stupid to even try to talk to. You just can't fix stupid  
714885,Harrison,2012-07-16 12:05:00,2202,"Too bad most idiots are not as easy to catch as a bass, they're everywhere too."
714886,craigdritchie,2012-07-16 12:07:00,1586,"I hate to say it, but a HUGE number of fishermen are complete and absolute morons who shouldn't be allowed to leave the house.  Took a walk along Bronte Pier last night with the wife. Lots of people out, including about four guys fishing. We walked to the end, and they were gone when we returned. The amount of garbage and crap these four idiots left behind (on the pier and in the water) was just disgusting. The rest of the pier was fine - totally clean. The area where the clowns were fishing was a disaster. I wasn't the only one who was disgusted.  And we wonder why we see more ""no fishing"" signs every year."
714887,bushart,2012-07-16 12:13:00,2628,Yeah this is about as blatant as it gets-----at least if they had taken them you'd think they would be ate????  But not a new phenomenon  Ive spent many years on the water and in the bush------Too many times I talked to hunters who took that shot they should'nt have on a deer or moose-----walked up---did'nt see immediate obvious blood-----Instantly assumed they missed---give up and head back to their truck  Only to find out later they did indeed hit the animal and it died later.---guess the wolves ate?   Another time I'm watching a weigh in at a local bass tourney------now one competitor brings in a limit of largies with 2 dead ones (l'il bigger than op's pic)---so to soften the look----the judge says---ok team #x---has a limit but 2 are sleeping I overheard one of the team members say they'd get rid of them on the road home-----wether they did....?????  Now this is just 2 examples but every once in a while most of us run across this scene if we spend enough time out there  Now you may or may not be able to fix stupid-----but sometimes you'd wish you could add electrodes to these individuals and give em a jolt when they did this till they learned respect
714888,lew,2012-07-16 12:14:00,12766, And I imagine that trend will continue too....sadly.

714950,Live2fish85,2012-07-16 16:01:00,1633,Out on Lake Ontario yesterday my friend and I seen a boat throw to good sized salmon over that were dead and stiff which they obviously had in the boat for a bit. We couldn't see there numbers on the boat and we had all of our rods down and they took off right after.  I think another boat seen and followed them though. Hope they report it to the mnr.
714953,fishnsled,2012-07-16 16:11:00,3520,That is disgusting and very sad to say the least. Can't imagine even doing that to a panfish. What the hell are people thinking.  I'd be letting the MNR know what was going on in the area.
714956,NAW,2012-07-16 16:15:00,4022,"That is brutal.  What did you do with the fish.  Knowing they where only there for a short period of time, they likely would still be good to eat, no?"
