714706,kickingfrog,2012-07-15 18:08:00,8333, I think this may have been photoshoped. There is no way dude would wear that shirt with those shorts.
714724,mike rousseau,2012-07-15 21:17:00,4661,Day 3 FAIL...  Beat by the Ottawa again....  Maybe you guys can photoshop to make this fish bigger...?...lol   
714731,mercman,2012-07-15 21:45:00,7054,"Geez Mike !!! That fish makes zack look 6 feet tall !!!!  I got shut out too, well almost....We struck walleye I brought my plan B tackle (i know you said dont give up)and we caught a couple jigging of all things"
714734,Christopheraaron,2012-07-15 22:01:00,3525,  
714735,Terry,2012-07-15 22:07:00,14456,it would be wrong to make the fish bigger   but  we could make everything else in the photo smaller         
714737,Christopheraaron,2012-07-15 22:10:00,3525, I beat you!
714742,mike rousseau,2012-07-15 22:35:00,4661,I shoulda stayed here... My brother caught this...
