He picked the rod out of the holder and told my buddy (who is  a less experienced fisherman than my son) that he had a good sized fish on. My buddy said ""No you don't."" Twice. MY son being an equitable fisherman was going to give Larry the rod, but after Larry told him twice that he didn't have a fish on, he decided to bring it to net by himself .  The look on Larry's face when the fish broke water 50' behind the boat said it all.  The boy was quite proud to show his fish off back at the Wiarton harbor.   "
