I rented a 24' pontoon boat from Lunge Haven (great service) and off we went.  I went out to the general area I had fished with Big Cliff last year, and hoped for the best   There were no big fish caught, although the older boy, 11 yrs, did get a nice little large mouth, so he was pretty happy, even if it wasn't a Walleye   This was the first time fishing with their grand parents, so they were pretty stoked.  Each boy managed a double header with one grand parent and everyone caught at least one fish.  After spending 4 hours out on the boat, we were fortunate enough to have permission to fish off Big Cliffs dock if the boys weren't ready to call it a day....of course they wanted to keep going.  It was a not stop perch/sunfish extravaganza   I could barely keep up with putting worms on and taking fish off...by the end of the day though, I had both boys doing it for themselves most of the time   The younger lad,8 yrs, also managed a small small mouth, his first, and the older one caught his first Blue Gill...  Overall it was a great day, with great company, and great weather....the boys asked at the end of the day if we could make this a tradition....hmmmm....I think I can manage that  Maureen"
715167,woodenboater,2012-07-17 01:52:00,2277, This part warms my heart immensely Maureen. Starting an annual tradition for the boys will lead to a lifetime of wonderful memories for everyone and give them something to look forward to.  Freddy
715182,Default User,2012-07-17 02:22:00,72,I totally agree with woodenBoater  I'm dying to get my nephews away from their video games and DVD movies and take them fishing. My 5 year old daughter loves it!  Hopefully we can rent a cottage large enough for 3 families so we can get 3 generations together casting

I was hoping to get a chance to see you but by the time I got home from work, you were already gone.  As far as making this a tradition; as long as I own this place you can count on it!"
715232,motv8tr,2012-07-17 10:50:00,2587,"Thanks Cliff, I would have really liked to have seen you too, but I was bagged and the boys were out of worms   You and I will get together at some point, of this I am sure  Maureen"
715347,Beans,2012-07-17 15:42:00,3339,Well done Maureen...Did you get some photos?  I imagine the boys are much bigger than in these pics   
715348,fishnsled,2012-07-17 15:48:00,3520,A great tradition to continue.  Thanks for the report!!
715388,Moosebunk,2012-07-17 17:28:00,3970,  For sure!
