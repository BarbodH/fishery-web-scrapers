715481,addy79,2012-07-17 20:29:00,573,Did Ray Emery sign somewhere? He looked good last year and was challenging  for top spot in Chicago...  And he lives in 'sauga so maybe he'd be up for it?!
715486,jedimaster,2012-07-17 20:46:00,3472,The leafs don't need a goalie they have reimer and scrivens.
715489,davey buoy,2012-07-17 20:50:00,5505," You keep believing that!!.lol.Sorry Jedi,I know your kidding."
715503,kickingfrog,2012-07-17 21:16:00,8333," Because history has proven over and over again, sound logic has no place here."
715653,jedimaster,2012-07-18 11:55:00,3472,"I was hoping for luongo, and if wend up with poggie? Oh think my blue blood may end getting a transfusion."

715679,grimsbylander,2012-07-18 13:08:00,3016,I think I've got an old Mr. Sieve in the garage. A coat of blue paint...who'll tell the difference?
709197,solopaddler,2012-06-25 22:49:00,8605," Well, like I mentioned earlier it wouldn't be for 9 more years.  No way is the guy going to play that long, he'll be retired long before that contract expires.  Because he signed it prior to turning 35 once he retires the contract doesn't count against the cap.  His cap hit is 5.3 mil, a very reasonable number for an elite starting goalie.  I'll take Lou at 5.3 per for the next 5-6 years any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  This caliber of goalie is not usually available, and under normal circumstances the cost would be way too much.  It's a unique situation that doesn't occur every day and here's hoping Burke can take advantage of it."
709203,kickingfrog,2012-06-25 23:00:00,8333,"The cap hit (per year or term) for bobby-lou really isn't the issue for me. It's what do the leafs trade for him? And what's with the 6 inches between his ears?  I'd really like JP's son in T.O. and he only costs you money, unlike Nash. The problem is, does he want to play here? And will the leafs give him the term that another team might offer him?"
709364,Stoty,2012-06-26 13:24:00,2910,JVR for Schenn?!!!!?!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  What the hell is Philly smoking there?!?!! Schenn is completely useless! Talk about a STEAL on JVR!  I was hoping that the Leafs would get something as good as a used puck bag or some new black tape for Schenn!
709378,TheLegend2012,2012-06-26 13:55:00,7,thing about luongo also is when the new CBA starts how/what kind of effect then will his contract have? pretty sure they are going to put a stop on these loooong contracts and/or make them honour them  luongo/erhoff/izgazlov and not to mention kovlachuk either (not spelt right and not looking up correct names...lol)  I do like luongo he is a top 5 goalie but I also have high hopes for reimer still call me crazy
709379,jedimaster,2012-06-26 14:02:00,3472,"I think louong for 2 years as a starter, take the heat off of reimer, and let him grow, then have lou backup for 3 more years while he fades away to retirement. Reimer can grow himself and find his game. He has talent, he needs to grow. With luongo the leafs will be good in goal for about 5-10 years. Presumming reimer pans out.  Then you have scrivens you can use topick up a draft pick at trade deadline for a team making a run without a backup.  I am not too sure what I would give up for luongo, maybe even scrivens and a draft pick for luongo, vancouver will need a backup for schnieder.  As for center, thats the big question mark in toronto as I think Luo is a lock. I would really like to see parise, but I don't think he will play here. I think nash is more likely. However that still leaves center open. I really think IF nash came here, both him and JVR would be tested on Center, and if that doesn't work then Burke will be shopping from a center around deadline day. I really wish he would have shelled out the coins for Richards."
709383,Squid,2012-06-26 14:14:00,1656,Nobody will willingly go to Toronto to play for the Laffs. They are better to work through their core of young players and build from there.
709384,BillM,2012-06-26 14:17:00,17367," Sure they won't, lol."
709396,jigsnreels,2012-06-26 14:30:00,133," You're crazy.  Luongo will go to Florida.  Fair weather and family ties - and a much better chance of making the playoffs.    Plus, the Panthers have more to offer in trades as well as a ton more cap space than the Leafs.  Burke better get cracking on a goalie deal, because unless they've made significant strides over last season, Reimer/Scrivens ain't going to cut it."
709399,uglyfish,2012-06-26 14:36:00,981," this has been the leafs problem for so many years!!!    its that mentality from fans and media that has pushed so many GM's in leaf land to make dumb moves to try and jumpstart a contender. they sell the future for some veterans hoping they can get the leafs in the playoffs.  but when burke unloads all those contracts and wasted roster spots, and starts getting young talent and they start drafting and developing players, then u all cry that they arent moving forward and they need to ""solve the problems"" by trading those players and getting guys like nash and luongo for a quick fix.  the marlies went to the calder cup finals, they had an excellant season, were a top team in the league and showed that the leafs were on the right track, developing players. burke has made some great moves. im not thrilled with the schenn deal, but kessel was a good pick up. 30+ goals each year for the leafs since being here, moved out all the big contracts he was left with, got lupol, gardiner, colborne, franson. the players they have drafted are all coming along very well and will only continue to improve.  if being an NHL GM was easy.,.. everyone would have the job."
709409,jedimaster,2012-06-26 15:27:00,3472,"Bringing in Luongo for the right deal, doesn't put us back at all. Reimer can't carry the team with the defense as sucky as it is for a whole season, he needs help for a few years. Of coure noone woul de happy to sell the farm to get luongo."
709431,uglyfish,2012-06-26 16:14:00,981," luongo wont help them either if theres no defense. keep in mind, it was a lack of defense that cost vancouver the cup  2 years ago, and ousted them from the playoffs this year. luongo let in bad goals, every goalie does, but without the guys in front of you playing.... the goalie wont make much of a difference. reimer can carry this team, and he will. trading anyone for a goalie would be stupid, its a waste of a player. if u want a veteran to back up, sign someone via free agency. u dont need to get  a 5 mil a yer guy like luongo to back up and mentor a young goalie. u get  a vet with solid mechanics and fundimentals. dont need to be the winningest goalie of all time, just needs to have a good head on his shoulders to show the kids the way to be a professional. and, as far as kids go, especially goalies.... good luck finding a more mature, level headed one the reimer."
709432,BillM,2012-06-26 16:16:00,17367,"I like Reimer, no reason to replace him."
709434,Jigger,2012-06-26 16:18:00,1237,"Team defense should be a little better under Carlyle. That said, i would think Reimer will have a better year as a result."
709453,jigsnreels,2012-06-26 17:12:00,133, Is he playing?
715437,Lip-ripper,2012-07-17 19:16:00,228,"""The Toronto Maple Leafs have reportedly made an offer for Jonathan Bernier.  In Toronto, Bernier would likely compete with James Reimer for the starting job and cost Ben Scrivens a roster spot. Bernier would give the Leafs another promising, but ultimately unproven young goaltender. Bernier wants to leave Los Angeles and Toronto would be a much better opportunity for him, but he might not be worth the cost for the Leafs. What the Leafs really lack when it comes to goaltending is an established and relatively safe starter. Bernier might develop into a great netminder, but he certainly doesn't fit into that category yet.""  IMO this would be a bad move... discuss amongst yourselves... "

715463,solopaddler,2012-07-17 19:57:00,8605, He has an obvious upside.  If the return was reasonable what's the problem?  There's not that many options floating around out there.

I think he has potental. He just isn't there yet. The leafs are going to go hard after Luongo and if they don't get him they are in big trouble. I hear florida is also gunning for lou"
709091,BillM,2012-06-25 17:53:00,17367,"Luongo will end up in Florida me thinks..  I don't care about the cup or even the playoffs in 12/13 for the Leafs.  I'd like to see Reimer have a complete season without injury, them beef up the front lines as well as the D.   Let Carlyle do his job.  Reimer played great before he sustained a concussion, it seems that people here are forgetting that."
709098,uglyfish,2012-06-25 18:16:00,981," lol ur kidding rite? u actually want the leafs to sell the farm to get luongo?? u want a goalie under contract for big money the next 10 years, who hasnt won anything in his career? hes a gret goalie, but not worth getting when u have 2 or 3 guys in ur system tht can win gmes for u for a long time. lets not forget that reimer and scrivens both plyed very well nd won the leafs games they shouldnt have won. the leafs biggest problems were a poor defense, and the need for another scoring forward down the middle.  even with JVR they still need a big skilled center.  trading schenn only hurt the tem as they now have only one stand up defensive dman, komisarek. phaneuf has been useless as a leaf. liles about the same, only served purpose on the power play. gunnarson is more of a puck moving dman, good in his own end, but not the bruising, shutdown dman they need. Gardiner is still young, has time to grow, more of an offensive thret, but plays well in his own end, considering his age.  problem is, as each year passes, people will point out his mistakes more and more... kinda like they did with schenn. gardiner made a lot of mistakes last year, giveaways, poor positioning, mental mistakes, but everyone let it slide because of his age, and the fact hes a rookie outta college.  young players need time to grow and learn, schenn is gonna be a force in philly, gonn play big minutes and will be an allstar this year or next.  JVR.... lets hope he can play a full season and maybe it'll be worth what they gave up to get him"
709099,Headhunter,2012-06-25 18:17:00,5703,"No Bill, I certianly am not forgetting he played well last year and for some of the year before as well... my biggest concern re Reimer is the same cocern I had a year ago... he hasn't even played 1/2 a season and the Leafs are putting him in this position? Talk about burn out the kid... HH"
709101,davey buoy,2012-06-25 18:28:00,5505, We still need a veteran goalie. At least for back up IMO.
709102,kickingfrog,2012-06-25 18:31:00,8333,L.A. and Phoenix had who for back-ups?
709105,solopaddler,2012-06-25 18:37:00,8605,"  I'm not sure the Leafs would have to sell the farm to aquire Luongo.  As far as Luongo the player goes, I believe he'd instantly make them a playoff team. The Leafs have plenty of deficiencies, but goaltending is their biggest.  Regarding Luongos contract being an albatross, I believe most are wrong on this point as well.  His cap hit is 5.3 mil. Check the salaries of pretty much any goalie with a couple of good seasons...you're looking at 6 mil plus.  As far as the length of the contract goes, so what? He'll retire long before that contract expires and that salary doesn't count against the cap since he signed prior to turning 35.  As far as I'm concerned it's a small price to pay for a franchise goalie.  Now if there is a larger than expected market for Lou and the Canucks are asking too much, then forget it.  I doubt that will happen though. Toronto is the logical destination now that Tampa has shored up its goaltending. I look forward to this aquisition big time."
709109,jedimaster,2012-06-25 18:50:00,3472,"I don't think a team will need to give up a tonne for Roberto. After all Vancouver has a huge contract on him to play as a backup. I wouldn't mind seeing riemer start 20 games and Roberto start 60 for the next 2 or 3 years. Reimer is not ready to stand on his own. neither was gustaf. As for the Center I still have hopes for nash.... So what do you guys think will be the asking price for Nash and Luongo? Woul dthat be enough to shore things up presumming JVR pans out. Don't forget losing schenn, is a no brainer for me. It wasn't working as expected and the leafs drafted imo a better defensive prospect than Schenn."
709112,solopaddler,2012-06-25 19:00:00,8605," Nash isn't a center, he's a winger. Don't think it's going to happen, the price will be too steep.  Looking at free agency Parise is more possible than Nash, after all it'd just be money involved.  Only problem is I doubt Parise would play here.  It honestly wouldn't surprise me if the Leafs picked up some tougher d men in free agency as well.  Suter is the obvious choice, but even though he's older I'd LOVE to see the Leafs sign Willie Mitchel. He's always been a tough steady player and was a big part of L.A.'s team this past season.  As far as a first line center goes they'll only get one through trade.  Personally I still think Stastny from Colorodo is a possibility, especially since Duchene is taking over as number 1."
709115,jedimaster,2012-06-25 19:06:00,3472,"I would think Nash would be tested out at center, just as JVR will be."
709121,solopaddler,2012-06-25 19:18:00,8605,"  Not a chance.  Nash has never played center, why would any team try and mess with his game?  Yes JVR played center in junior, but his skill set is not conducive to center in the NHL. Burke himself has already said he likes him right where he's been...on the wall."
709133,Grimace,2012-06-25 19:43:00,2020, You would think wrong.
709135,davey buoy,2012-06-25 19:47:00,5505, Burke should watch his back if he doesn't do anything with the goal tending issue.#1 job asap IMO.
709137,solopaddler,2012-06-25 19:51:00,8605, Agreed. Look 6 posts above yours for the answer.
709140,jedimaster,2012-06-25 20:06:00,3472,"If they don't find a center, phaneuf might be playing down the middle."
709142,davey buoy,2012-06-25 20:14:00,5505," Don't get me started on him,another one.lol."
709143,jedimaster,2012-06-25 20:14:00,3472,And beside even kessle started at center for a few games so to say jvr won't get a sniff or nashs if he did come here is a bit short sited. That's not to say it would stick or work. But I think its a posibility.
709150,Jigger,2012-06-25 20:34:00,1237,"Can see Burke throw the farm at Parise. He knows that he lost out on Richards by not going against his contract ""code"". I dont think hell have the same reservations with Parise.  Luongo, no thanks.  Semin, no thanks.  Nash, no thanks.  Parise, at all costs!"
709168,uglyfish,2012-06-25 21:55:00,981,Parise would be a great addition! I'm all for that.  And the reason luongo is still a canuck is because vancouver is asking a ton for him. And they won't move him unless they get what they're asking for. I wouldn't be shocked to see him stay where he is another year
709173,tb4me,2012-06-25 22:05:00,3295,"you hit the nail right on the head..Louongo should be moveable in a heartbeat, however with his contract they cant give him away..The problem for Vancouver is they want to resign Cory Schnider..He is looking to make 4.5 mill himself. What team has 10 mill set aside for their goalies alone? One of them will have to move. Somthin tells me it wont be LOU Go get Thomas for 2 to 4 years Burkie..I could personally care less if he is a freak..Great mentor for Reims"
709175,BillM,2012-06-25 22:08:00,17367,"Parise isn't leaving NJ, great thought but it's never going to happen.. They'd be stupid to not renew his contract.  July 1st should be an interesting day!"
709176,solopaddler,2012-06-25 22:12:00,8605," Gillis has grossly mishandled Luongo.  He publicly humiliated him which prompted Luongo to request a trade.  I believe Gillis is likely asking too much, but then it's his job as gm to do so.  But being backed into a corner and more or less forced to make a deal is his own doing.  It may not happen right away but Lou will be gone before next season, and no the return won't be huge for Vancouver.  That's the way I see it anyway."
709182,Jigger,2012-06-25 22:18:00,1237," Parise will only be in NJ when he's on the visitors bench. They have some major financial trouble going on there at the moment, and Kovalchuks contract absolutely hamstrung the Devils. Like I said, Burkes going to make a huge move for him, but I'm reading the Pens and Red Wings have the cap space and are considered his most likely destination. Also, Minnesota apparently has stated they will match any contract offered in terms of money and duration."
709184,TheLegend2012,2012-06-25 22:19:00,7,"like parise but he has NO interest in playing in Toronto + detroit has 20 million under the cap and will be going for parise and suter  luongo,I like him but Not for 9 more yrs,were stuck with reimer/scrivens--thomas is also out of the question he is playing head games with boston,only has 1-2 yrs left do U think he will come here on a team that probably wont make playoffs again next yr? we are far behind last yrs 8 playoff teams,then add in buffalo ,and tampa and the Canes,all who have improved this month,we have our work cut out for us there"

708522,kickingfrog,2012-06-23 17:27:00,8333,"The other possibility is that Thomas gets traded to a team that wants to save money and help to get to the cap floor.  Thmoas is due a million bucks or so I believe, his cap hit is five point whatever million dollars and if he doesn't report (as has been speculated) the team doesn't have to pay him but the money counts against the cap."

708613,Grimace,2012-06-24 00:56:00,2020," Absolutely correct.   JVR hasn't reached his potential yet, has underachieved as of late and has been injury plagued but we can all salivate over his performance in last years playoffs.  He was also rushed along.  That is the 'New NHL' as they like to call it.  Instead of a middle class they have a bunch of high priced stars and a bunch of young kids that have no business being there.  Hopefully both ships will be righted and both teams come out happy.  As for Brian Burke vomiting out more hyperbole by saying that if he picked number 1 he would have picked Reilly.   What a crap thing to say.  All he has to do is pick and shut up.  You do not have to 'up talk' your draft picks.  Give your fan base a little credit.  That boils my blood about Burke.   I do however love the picks he made today.  Reilly looks great, Finn was a steal at 35 as he was suppose to go 21 and he is a Storm player which I like.  Ryan Rupert was an absolute steal at 15sumthin.  I didnt see where the other Rupert kid went."
708628,muskymatt,2012-06-24 01:56:00,2608,Too bad JVR's career is over now that he's a laff!

708633,uglyfish,2012-06-24 02:07:00,981,Stupid trade... So much for improving the team. Guess having a dman that blocks shots and actually hits opposing players is bad for ur team... Good thing we still have phaneuf!

708447,kickingfrog,2012-06-23 00:45:00,8333, Staal is solid and young but my first thought is the Hurricanes gave up too much.

708456,kickingfrog,2012-06-23 01:41:00,8333,He is a ufa after this coming season I believe. He may be very motivated to re-sign but someone may throw huge cash at him.

A local news report showed pics of Sid the kid at our airport yesterday. The Staal bros. own a pretty nice cottage at a lake not far from town and I suspect that the team will be there on Saturday. A guy that I was working with today was going fishing at that lake tomorrow so I told him to do a drive by with a camera. Should be fun."

What about Buffalo?  Leafs finished only ahead of Isles and a bad habs team this year----so far---what's changed????  one trade won't cut it
708474,kickingfrog,2012-06-23 03:18:00,8333,"I don't know where Toronto will end up but the Rangers, flyers, devils and bruins will have a tough time getting as many points as they did in 11/12. Of course 1 or 2 of those teams will likely take some points from the others so a few may end up with more, they will only do it by taking away points from the other 2 or 3.  The caps, while not a strong team, play in a frequently weak division. Equals wildcard."

U can't fault a goalie that gets run by another player and gets hurt, or that has no help in front of him. Trading for a goalie would be plain stupid. Waste of prospects/draft picks/players. Staal will never come to the leafs, it wouldn't even be a thought to get him. Nash will cost too much, but we'll see how much burke could whittle down the jackets on their asking price. Parise is the only free agent really worth signing as a free agent.  Schenn is a solid dman, u want poor play, phaneuf was the worst on the blueline last year."

They need a number goalie. I don't think that can sit back and gamble on what they had last year this year again. I think Alaire was a big part of the problem as well, but the org has its hooks deep with him."

The guy gets no powerplay time at all. As a Pens fan it would suck to see him go because he's a very good all around player but I understand why he wants out, he'll always be stuck behind the 2 best centers in the league and his potential is too high to be 3rd line center for his entire career. But considering what Ray Shero got for Goligoski (Neal and Niskanen) it probably won't be cheap to get him."

There won't be a Stanley Cup team in Toronto until the fans, fired-up by the local sports press, stop screaming for quick fixes.  You have to except that neither Rome not a winning team is built in a day.  For almost 50 years the Leafs had traded the future for retreads to ""save the season."" Look how well it has worked!!!

I must say THANK YOU to the leafs for the start of last season as dad got to pass away with them on a good start towards the cup. I have heard him rolling around on the shelf here at home he must be watching them from the other side.
708249,GreenCanada,2012-06-22 04:38:00,375,"Come on boys, the Leafs are positioned to be able to make some moves and pull in some key pieces. Hopefully we are able to land a proven goaltender and a quality centre before the summer is out. I'm looking at tomorrow and July 1st to make some deals.  I wouldn't mind seeing Staal, Ryan, Parise, or Nash (not at the same asking price as at the trade deadline), in a Leafs jersey or even moving up in the draft to grab Galchenyuk. I have a strong feeling that Montreal will snag him before we get the chance, mainly so Toronto doesn't get him. Pretty petty, but I don't expect much else from the Canadiens.  Luongo would be a nice upgrade, but I'd rather make an offer sheet for Cory Schneider. $5 mill would only require a 1st and a 3rd I think. Not a bad deal and if the Canucks matched, then they would have no choice but to deal Luongo. No way they can keep over $10 mill in goalies going forward.  I don't want to see Schenn go as he is only 22 and Wilson basically messed the kid up. Same goes with Kadri.  That being said, I don't think there are many untouchables.  We should try and move up, but not if the price is ridiculous. We have been steadily getting better since Burke came, regardless of what the haters say. We had little to no prospects JFJ in charge and that has changed. It takes time to build a perpetual contender, but we are working towards that goal. It isn't an overnight accomplishment, but patience is not infinite. Burke understands this is likely his last year if they don't make the playoffs, so hopefully he doesn't do something for short term gain and longterm pain.  Go Leafs Go!"
708250,GreenCanada,2012-06-22 04:46:00,375," You can rent lots of mediocre players by trading draft picks, to just scratch the surface of the playoffs as JFJ often did.  We are miles ahead of where JFJ left us, we had to fix what he broke, first."
708253,Stoty,2012-06-22 05:00:00,2910," They've been in that position ever since Burke started...yet he seems to enjoy ""the pooch"", if ya know what I mean!   Schenn is the most useless player they Leafs have......unless you enjoy defensive zone blunders and a good 3-4 horrible turn-overs a game.  Kadri = GREAT pre-season/practice player!"
708273,d_paluch,2012-06-22 13:07:00,343,"You can't say that Stoty, Wilson had him playing 1-2 dman minutes, and he just isn't there yet. Then he basically got benched, which threw all of his confidence out the window.  I think (read, hope) Schenn can turn it around this year. Who knows.  One things forsure is I doubt Karlsson will have a repeat. Good dman, sure, but I don't think he will be a repeat ppg player"
708276,TheLegend2012,2012-06-22 13:19:00,7,"dont think Staal is worth the trade ONLY cuz he is a UFA after this yr and all signs are he is going to play with his bro in carolina,so to give up XX for a guy to leave in a yr isnt worth the gamble unless its a trade and sign deal to secure him here  Leafs are in no hurry to get luongo,its the Nucks who need to move him to be able to sign schneider + most other teams have already got their goalie like tampa did and Minny resigned theirs  Luv nash but cant see leafs getting him just not enough horses to part with"
708279,jedimaster,2012-06-22 13:33:00,3472,"There are some players I would like to see on the leafs that are available at some price point, Nash, Staal, Luongo... the list goes on. Listening to an interview Nonis and he is saying there are no talks going on about moving anywhere in the draft and that they won't likely be able to get the forward they want so they will settle for the best player available and that's likely going to be a defenseman. It doesn't really sound like any big moves will be made the leafs have the 5th and 35th, so hopefully they can pick someone up thats useful"

Of course we all know how they fell apart, the defense got exposed and so did the goaltending. Everyteam has a few guys that cough the puck up, its innevetable. The leneed to further tighten up the d line, and pickup a goalie. I would like to see a big time center as well."
