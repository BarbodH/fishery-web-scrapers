579806,bubbles,2011-05-05 11:49:00,591,"I work in the industry, that is a scary MSDS and nothing on there is doing the lakes you launch in any favours that's for sure. The reason they are using heptane and hexane is because they are oily and will ""stick around"" for a while.  NOT something you want in the lake."
579811,aplumma,2011-05-05 12:05:00,6896,Adding the chemicals in the parts per million is not going to damage even a small farm pond. Contact time of the trailer is... 2 min? Time you have your gas motor in the water running/contacting and exhausting into the water... couple hours lets not blow this out of prospective. If it was a worthy concern you would not need the product you would be more worried about the damage the actions of your sport does than the launching.    Art
579816,pikehunter,2011-05-05 12:33:00,1659,KABOOM! 
579856,Sinker,2011-05-05 15:14:00,8692,"I can winch mine off if I have to. Just run the strap from the winch under the front roller, then back to the bow clip on the boat. It will winch right off. If you don't have a front roller, add a pully/rolly there for your strap to roll on, and it will winch right off easily.  S."
579009,barrystrs,2011-05-03 14:50:00,75,"I have a new to me nitro bass boat, that seems to be a lot heavier than I am used to.  One of the places I like to launch has a very shallow ramp.  I won't be able to push the boat off the trailer.  Has anyone added rollers to a bunk trailer?  I have an idea in mind to use a threaded rod to raise a couple of centre rollers just when I need them.  Any comments or suggestions?  Thaks Barry"
579013,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-03 15:17:00,10439,"Barry You have a couple of options here. Either install a set of Roller Bunks or a set of Glyde Sticks, both will do what you want."
579041,Garry2Rs,2011-05-03 17:04:00,1425,"I have never had trouble launching off of bunks. If there's enough water to float the boat you can launch, if not, how do you get the boat back on the trailer?"
579069,SmokestackLightnin,2011-05-03 18:03:00,390," Yep, what 2rs said, and I have a Nitro."
579083,barrystrs,2011-05-03 18:41:00,75,"I have never heard of glyde sticks or the slippery pads, sounds like a great idea, I will try them.  Thanks"
579091,aplumma,2011-05-03 19:10:00,6896,Their is a product called liquid roller it is the greatest product made for launching a boat. I can not emphasize how slick this is it will dump your boat off the bunks on to the ramp without being wet. Always leave your strap or chain on till you are in place I kid you not. I saw two boats last year hit the ramp because of how effective this product is. The best part of it is your boat is supported fully on the boards of the trailer instead of on pressure spots were the glid-sticks (minor) or rollers (major)come in contact.   Art
579201,Billy Bob,2011-05-03 22:51:00,5865,Do any of you guys remember making fun at how I launch my boat (for over 25 years now)......well guess what...I have NO PROBLEM launching or retrieving my boat in shallow water conditions or deep water conditions...  Notice how high and dry the trailer is.....I do like to go just a bit deeper but I didn't want to get my feet wet...

579269,mikdor,2011-05-04 00:48:00,109,Were Would I find this Liquid roller and is it harmful to the environment or the boat. Sounds very interesting.Thanks mikdor

579368,aplumma,2011-05-04 11:59:00,6896, Here is a link for the product.  liquid roller link   msds link   I know that it stays were you put it on the rails for at least one season so far and their is no visible signs that it is released like an oil shine on the water. The boat shows no signs from the product and it does not attract dirt or dust to scratch the finish. If you don't want to order from the USA you can google the company name or product name from the link and get it locally I am sure.   Art
579377,Billy Bob,2011-05-04 12:41:00,5865,Looks like a idea product....one other option I have been doing for years is get a can of silicone spray and  use the whole can on the bunks once a year...sometimes you can get a can for about $2 on sale.
579390,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-04 13:24:00,4399,I would guess if yer power loading the bass boat with these slippery bunks ya might want to go easy on the throttle!
579405,pikehunter,2011-05-04 14:14:00,1659,"Liiquid roller sounds good. Go to the MSDS link that was also posted for list of contents, interesting. "

579636,Jer,2011-05-05 00:13:00,1426,  Not much different than the MSDS for many of your common household products.
579672,aplumma,2011-05-05 00:55:00,6896,The advantage that this product has over using a silicone based product is it does not attract dirt or dust. It dries with out residue. If their is a product that can mimic it it is Scotchgard water proofing spray. Since they are the same price about best to stay with the original since it won't stain the fiberglass or react with the gel coating.  Jer While the propellant and the carry agents are present in most oil penetrating fluids it is not similar in the important area of actual  active ingredients. You should never read the MSDS sheet as a way to find a substitute the same ingredients combined in different ratios can yield either liquid fertilizer or a bomb.    Art
