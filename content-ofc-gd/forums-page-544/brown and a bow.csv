578696,kickingfrog,2011-05-02 20:33:00,8333,I voted at the advanced poles last weekend so I went fishing this afternoon when I got off work.  Had a flash at the first pool I tried but that was it. Went quite a few pockets and pools before seeing any sign of another fish. It wrapped me around some wood and was gone before I was able to tell what type of trout it was.  Finally a small brown from a small hole that I helicoptered my spinner into.  First fish on my first rod made by spiel.    A few spots later I got this small bow. He was about 14 inches.    And with that I called it a day. Both fish were caught on a #6 panther martin brass spinner which you can see in the second photo.

578702,Spiel,2011-05-02 20:49:00,9065,"Very nice Rob, I love small stream trout on a small stream rod, makes 'em every bit as fun (perhaps more) as their bigger brethren."
