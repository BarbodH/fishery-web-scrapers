578987,umKthxbye,2011-05-03 13:02:00,247,Is it true you can only eat them once a month due to the mercury levels?
579053,ehg,2011-05-03 17:24:00,2666,Great report
579102,kenzy31,2011-05-03 19:49:00,261,"Beauty fish!  Great job out there. Were you using riggers, lead, or flat-lining those body baits?"
579177,greg1983,2011-05-03 21:53:00,20," fishing with planer boards and long lining I'm not sure how many of them you can eat actually.  The small ones seem okay, younger fish.  more just for the excitement."
