Or that it is ok for Harper to finagle tax cuts to large corperations in order to pad his pocket first??? At election crisis.??  As far as wasted money goes. conservatives are notorious for suporting corperate bank accounts. At the expence of lower middle class Canadians.  They are also well known for their arrogance and decete.  If you look at their reccord over the past you will see that conservative majority govrment leaves nothing but a wake of decete... And it always centres around MONEY... WHERE DID IT GO???  ???????? Oh ya the next goverment has to spend millions telling the public where it went. Then the pc have the audasity to accuse the current goverment of wasting taxpayers money ??? DECETE...  And no I do not support any of Canadas current political parties...  They are nothing but a joke as proved Monday nite..
579351,pikehunter,2011-05-04 10:34:00,1659," Agree.  I'm amazed by how so many forget Mike Harris and what he did. And Mulroney and the GST. Then the Fiberals promise of dropping the GST.  I am left minded, sorry if that offends those of you who are not but that is exactly why I vote and why this is the best place to live.  Doesn't matter who gets elected, we all know that they will do whatever it is to piss off the next guy.  We all need to go FISHING!

Us older conservatives have a plan you see, as I understand it smiling jack wants to double the pension so 4 years from now all us old right wingers that are close to retirement are going to stuff the ballot boxes with NDP votes and Jack is going to double our pensions and you young dummies as you call yourselves are going to pay for it.  And don`t worry being young and dumb in most cases does not last forever!!!"
579391,blarg,2011-05-04 13:26:00,289,"  What Bull, how much again did Chretien cut from health care in the 90's? how much did he spend on helicopters that he didn't buy? how many of the old ones fell out of the sky in the mean time? how much did he spend on the 2 million dollar registry? how much money was misplaced in the hrdc scandal? how many loans did he get for friends? how much money went missing during the sponsorship scandal? how many protesting kids were pepper sprayed at the APEC conference? ""For me, pepper, I put it on my plate."" Jean C. how much did he interfere with the tainted blood scandal? how much did he interfere with the investigation into the military's actions in Somalia? how about when he raided the ei fund to pay down the debt to the tune of 50 billion, that was ruled illegal btw. how about choking that protester, though I was with him on that one. The GST lie  I'm sure there is more, you know his nickname was little dictator? amongst others.  So look, all I am saying is that there is no point to this, Harper is not an angel, but he certainly has not reached the Chretien level of scandal yet, and he got 3 majorities, so lets take a breathe, accept that politicians are mostly cut from the same cloth with slight variations in their beliefs.  The sky isn't falling, nor will it."
579392,Warthaug,2011-05-04 13:27:00,30,"Harper was raising spending before the recession hit, which was clearly shown in the graph in the link I provided.  Had he held spending steady, at pre-harper levels, we'd never have gone further into debt during the recession.  I voted for Harper (literally, I lived in his riding at the time) when he rose to power.  Since then he has done nothing but stab in the back those who supported his first election bid.  Controlled spending - nope.  Smaller gov - nope.  No non-elected senators - nope.  Set election dates - nope.  Transparent government - nope.  Instead we have one of the most costly and secretive governments since the 1970's, a senate stuffed with conservative fund-raisers and party faithful, and record deficits at a time when we should be saving money for the demographic tidal wave we can all see coming.  I.E. he became, within weeks, exactly the same as the people he campaigned against.  In all likelihood, it was wasted.  Stimulus spending has a long history, in our own country and others, and yet, it has never once succeeded in its goals.  There is no reason to expect this time will be any different.  In the past, stimulus spending was too little, applied too late, to have any impact.  This time around there is no evidence to suggest this changed - at the time when the recession was technically over less than half the stimulus money had actually been spent.  Even assuming the full dedicated amount was spent, you're still talking an ""investment"" of ~0.8% to total economic loss Canada experienced during the recession.  Too little, too late.  And those ""new buildings"" you're so excited about are, assuming history repeats itself, going to cause more long-term harm than short-term good.  Stimulus spending like that used to build buildings creates a glut of temporary work, but at the same time depletes the ""pool"" of ongoing projects that are the bread-and-butter of construction companies.  Long term effect, historically, has always been the same - post-recessionary woes in the construction industry, due to a lack of new projects to sustain the industry.  Basically, this kind of stimulus steals from peter (i.e. the future) to sell paul (current voters) an illusion that something is being done.  But building infrastructure does give politicians something to point at, come election time.  And so long as people choose to ignore history and basic economics, those kinds of monuments to ignorance of history and basic economic theory will politicians votes.  As the saying goes, those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.  Bryan"
579395,bigbuck,2011-05-04 13:39:00,2449,"I've been involved in the political game since I was a teenager hammering in signs, knocking on doors, being a scrutineer, campaign manager, etc... Politics boils down to power and money. Don't ever forget that. The best government we could have would maintain the status quo. We just don't have the money to double pensions, spend billions and billions on infrastructure, give to the poor.  Do we need new fighter jets, yes we do, our current fleet of CF18's are coming to the end of their service lives. Buying items like that is not exactly cut and dried, the next generation of fighters need to be fully developed and that takes time and lots of money. They aren't cheap and it's not easy. Here in Canada, our politicians like to politicize every single big ticket defence purchase. Look at how much helicopters cost us. Hundreds of millions of dollars to cancel contracts and several crashed aging obsolete Sea Kings that are 30 years past their prime. How about submarines?? We went and bought old diesel subs from the Royal Navy that were not even seaworthy. I don't know about the rest of you but I want the men and women of the Canadian Forces to have good reliable equipment to defend my freedom, not old junk that nobody else wants. They don't need the Cadillac of equipment to do their jobs, the Chevy will suffice. The Halifax class frigates that are the backbone of our navy are getting older and we need to think about replacing them over the next 20 years, it takes time to develop weapons systems, hulls, electronics, engines, etc.... Our freedom that we don't fully appreciate comes with a price, don't ever forget that.  As for taxation, yes, big businesses need tax breaks, otherwise they will relocate elsewhere where taxes are more favourable to them. How many well paying jobs would we lose?? Manufacturing is all but dead in Ontario because we allowed business to leave. Businesses are necessary folks, they provide jobs for everyone. We already have a bloated public sector that costs us a fortune to keep up. We can't have lots of social services without lots of taxation. All those services need to be paid for. I could go on and on and on."

Our men and women in the CF do such an amazing job with the equipment they have because of the training they receive. That funding needs to be protected, and following Monday's vote, I'm more confident it will be."

I think it's great that Quebec voted for a real national party even though I don't agree with the left wing agenda. I hope this spells an end to the politics of ""power at any cost"" and group rights instead of individual rights. I am disappointed when people discussed the politics of the gun registry and nobody even bothered to mention the most offensive part which was the governments right to search and seize without a warrant. Gun owners in this country became second class citizens when the gun registry bill was passed. The right to protection from unreasonable search and seizure is a fundamental right in any free and democratic society. The Liberals showed their complete contempt for this in favour of garnering votes from the anti gun crowd and taking political advantage of the knee jerk reaction to the killings in Montreal. Fifteen years of a dark page in Canadian history is about to end."

Not that our other options were all that great.  In a few years it isn't going to matter.  Not counting promises made this election, over the next 20 years we have unfunded liabilities of ~2.1 trillion dollars.  What that means is the predicted cost of health care, cpp, old-age, etc, are expected to exceed our ability to pay for it by 2.1 trillion dollars (assuming tax rates stay the same, equivalent per-capita age-corrected spending, etc).  So no matter who gets in power, pretty soon they are going to be faced with a hard choice - they'll either need to cut somewhere between 16 an 19% in gov spending, or increase taxes by an equal amount.  Not one party has policies in place to deal with this problem; every party ran on platform which will aggravate this issue.  But hey, what do they care.  They'll all be retired when the feces hit the fan  Bryan"
579097,Governator,2011-05-03 19:20:00,879,"  No, you know what was stupid?  The opposition voting down the Government and having a reelection to begin with when the outcome was inevitable.  It costs Canadians $300 million dollars to run an election (We've had 4 in 7 years).  Money well spent for losing power in the house & putting us further in debt.  I'd rather have an extra couple fighter jets than a reelection any day.  False promises come from ALL parties including those that think they can magically change the landscape of education, healthcare, environment and all private organizations in just a couple of years without increasing taxes. Sadly that logic only works if they go after businesses to get money for it.  This of course backtracks us, raising unemployment rate and the closing down of small businesses.  You can't have it one way without hurting the other, the middle ground just doesn't exist no matter what lies they tell you."

The Conservatives have more seats than all other parties combined. That is a majority, pure and simple.  Nearly all of the that 60% is from the centre left.  That's not really true. About half of the seats (43) picked up by the Conservatives and NDP came at the expense of the Bloc Quebecois, which  is (was) a right-wing party. They split from from the Conservatives in 1991, and most of its senior leadership were MPs and cabinet ministers under Brian Mulroney (the Bloc had 47 seats prior to the election, they now have 4).  The conservatives received almost the same percent of the popular vote as the last election.  Yup, they got a two percent jump (39.6 percent in 2011 versus 37.6 percent in 2008).

Anybody who thinks things are going to be ""magically"" fixed is more delusional than can be explained.  Also agreed - magic doesn't exist, which is why I had a hard time with both Ignatieff's and Layton's spending commitments when neither of them had hard budgets to back them up.

579043,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-03 17:08:00,4399,  Justin Trudeau as Liberal party leader would help too ensure many more years of Conservative reign!!!
579044,irishfield,2011-05-03 17:10:00,26272,  I can see you eating those words in the next decade Gord!  Now can someone go fishing and post a report....

I will give you a hint EI."
579049,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-03 17:19:00,0,i forgot.  we on the left are fools who have yet to be enlightened.  shall i do that in school or at church? what's your magical explanation for a deficit?  is that the fault of the left too?
579052,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-03 17:21:00,4399,  Could be Wayne but I don`t think the Trudeau monicker would garner much support outside of Quebec!!!
579055,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-03 17:27:00,4399,"  ""we on the left are fools""  remember you said it not me, they say that admitting you have a problem is the first step to a cure!"
579058,Grimace,2011-05-03 17:33:00,2020," Just the facts mam.  When Mike Harris left office he was 4 billion in debt, and that was after he sold the 407.  And the junior teachers and government workers that once belly ached about Ray days were axed.  After Harris, those out of work would have gladly taken a Ray day here or there.  Justin Trudeau is a little puke, he objected to Canada's citizen guide describing honour killings as Barbaric.  He said he was uncomfortable with them described with such a 'perjorative'.   Oh gee you would not want to offend a possible honour killer.  I feel politically homeless as there is no choice of representation for my left leaning secular values.  Oh well, have a good day folks.  No matter what your politics have a good and healthy summer.   Bent rods and tight lines."

579063,ehg,2011-05-03 17:46:00,2666,"That is what i am talking about! Harper spent over a billion dollars on G20 security and Toronto still got trashed as security stood and watched. Geez, we have to wait 5 yrs. to tally up the losses after we get hoodwinked even though there is such transparency.  Couldn't picture Harper doing any fishing, especially if there is mosquitoes or bees around."
579065,Headhunter,2011-05-03 17:49:00,5703,"Hey Doc... Firstly, I am not slamming you or anyone who holds beliefs such as you... but maybe I can shed some light for you. When I was younger, I to, was somewhat left leaning. As I grew older, I found that my frustration with the left grew substancially as a result of what I preceived to be massive waste. I also continue to be frustrated by the amount of taxes I have paid over time, with very little evidence of proper spending. You may find that after you have paid huge amounts of taxes over a longer period of time, you to, will develop frustrations with politicians and their spending habits. Historically, the left has had a spend first ask questions later approach, IMHO, with the right at least seemingly being more ""conservative"" (for lack of a better term) in it's spending habits. HH  Drifter, I prefer this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsAeTfDeVHs&feature=related"
579066,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-03 17:56:00,0,"HH...  I'm actually a fiscal conservative with lefty environmental policy.  That's why billions on uncomplete jets and overblown G8/G20 spending during a recession seems irresponsible. Also, as a fisherman, I find it tough to justify voting for the party with the least worry about environmental issues.  I also think it's funny that you feel the need to be condescending by insinuating that voting for the left is some sort ""immaturity"" issue.  I'm 31 years old, not 18."

579072,Grimace,2011-05-03 18:08:00,2020," Lol.   I am glad you saw that as a joke. You never know how your going to come across in text.  Anyways get ready for middle class taxes to go up, corporate taxes to go down, bank deregulation and cutting everything that would benefit anyone without a million bucks in the bank.  Health cuts are imminent.  But hey, when he cuts corporate taxes I am sure they will pass the savings along.  Just like the jerks are passing along the savings from the HST (provincial yes but backed fully by Harper who actually gave Ontario some bonus money for it), and just like the jerk businesses that are not passing along the value of the high dollar.  Maybe his corporate tax cuts can create a bunch of jobs for 15 bucks an hour with no benefits.  Oh joy.  Oh boy, I really didn't want to rant.  No sense talking to you anyway, your a bloody Habs fan!!!   Lol."
579075,Headhunter,2011-05-03 18:19:00,5703,"Hey Doc, I didn't mean to be condescending, sorry if you took it that way... and at 31 years old, you got a whole heck of a lot of taxes to pay, before you'll move closer to the right! You are only now, beginning to enter your real ""earning years"". Start adding up all the taxes paid over the next 20 years and we'll have a chat then! LOL HH"

578976,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-03 12:19:00,4399,"  Isn`t that the truth, our NDP candidate in Dufferin County also worked in a bar in Capreol of all places. That probably has something to do with her not bothering to show for the debates or photo opps, no office,no signs nothing.  I am sure the NDP never expected to do so well so there were a lot of ""throw away"" canadidates that ended up winning by default. One thing you can say though is the house of commons is an equal opportunity employer!!! I am guess the good member because of her travel experience will have a shot at being the new foreign affairs minister.  Question period could be a very interesting place."

It personally worries me but its the mandate of the people, hopefully Harper delivers what you expect of him. "
578980,Headhunter,2011-05-03 12:37:00,5703,Bob Rae will be the new Liberal leader... then we will have two NDP leaders! HH
578982,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-03 12:40:00,4399,  You are so right Terry it is scary on so many levels but if the yanks can have wrestlers and actors in politics we can have our single mother bar maids in politics. I hope Ms Brosseau can find her way to her new office. 
578983,Beans,2011-05-03 12:43:00,3339, That would be the nail in the coffin for the Liberal Party in Ontario...We are not all senile yet and can remember him as Premier...   
578984,bigugli,2011-05-03 12:47:00,6138,"Bob Rae is no labourite. Anybody remember the service cuts made by ""Rae Days"" and public service layoffs. Hospital budgets were frozen and entire wards were closed to make up the shortfall. Hospital beds that never reopened. He is a political opportunist capable of speaking out of both sides of his mouth at the same time. He had that skill mastered by the time he left the U of T. Give him enough prep time and he could give a convincing debate as a proponent of the Nazi party or the Monarchist League. He was quite entertaining to listen to when debating."
578986,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-03 13:00:00,4399,If you want a chuckle check out Ms Brosseau`s Facebook page  . She does not even speak French in an all Francophone riding  You have to ask yourself how does the NDP find these people
578990,craigdritchie,2011-05-03 13:15:00,1586,"Ignatieff got exactly what he deserved. Call an election no one wants, and you will be the one to take the fall. Even a child could have seen that coming.  The Liberals need to get their house in order. They haven't had any kind of leadership since Chretien, and let's face it - Bob Rae or Justin Trudeau are not the answer here. The Libs need to figure out who they are and what they stand for. They went into this election with no platform. None! Asking people to vote for you ""because you're not Stephen Harper"" is not going to do it. That's not leadership, and it isn't offering a vision that people can grasp on to.  No wonder they got so few votes.  The only reason the NDP got as many seats as they did is because there was no one else to vote for if you didn't want the Conservatives. If the Liberals can get their act together over the next five years, they will send the NDP back to having maybe 30 - 40 seats, max. But if they can't do that, or if they trot out another loser of a leader, then they'll be finished.  God help us if the NDP ever get into power."

578994,bigbuck,2011-05-03 13:44:00,2449,"Bob Rae will probably be the next leader of the Liberal Party and like mentioned above, Justin Trudeau will lead one day. The Liberals got what they deserved this time around, they brought down a semi functional Parliament for no good reason other than a power play. Jack Layton squeezed himself in between the Liberals and thankfully brought down the Bloc, they won't qualify for federal funding next time around if there is one for them. It's because of the Bloc that we have had 3 successive minority governments, they split the vote in Quebec. At least Layton will be in Ottawa to keep the Tories honest. The Greens have a seat and Elizabeth May should make things interesting any time the environment is brought up in the Lower House. I hope the first order of business is to bring down the Long Gun Registry. The Second to be the elimination of Federal funding for qualifying Political Parties, I don't believe that my tax dollars should fund them especially a party that wants to separate from Canada. I'm not a firm believer of cutting my own throat."
578995,Vanselena,2011-05-03 13:49:00,269," I voted Conservative because the thought of an NDP lead coalition was way to scaryyyy!  The overall results were great. A stable Quebec = a stable country in the worlds eyes, meaning our economy should do better as more investment money flows into the country. Perhaps now Quebec will see an economic boost, it is a very pretty and historic province,,, oh and the food is awesome.  Was glad to see TO finally come to their senses. Hopefully TO votes blue when the provincial elections happen in October."
578997,craigdritchie,2011-05-03 14:15:00,1586,Well that didn't take long .... according to the CBC Ignatieff has officially quit as Liberal leader.
578998,torco,2011-05-03 14:19:00,656," I am pretty sure the Cons wanted this election they are masters at the political game and I think they played the Liberal party well.  I don't know the NDP at the provincial level (outside of Ontario) has done well a running government. Manitoba under Doer and Saskatchewan under Romanow probably being the best examples.  I didn't see any vision from Harper either, he just played doomsday scenarios and tried to scare people. He first got elected with a vision of accountability and transparency but never delivered on it.  Just to be straight with everyone I am not a member of any party but I am liberal with a small "" l"" in my beliefs. I will never be able to wrap my head around conservatism.

Hmmm the last conservative majorities federally and provincially i can think of were Mulroney and Mike Harris here in Ontario. The legacy of debt and recession left by them is sickening. Sort of like anti- Robin Hoods take from the poor and give to the rich. Harper looks like such a nerd. Couldn't picture him ever fishing unless it is photo-op. Oh well....

There was a lot of dislike for Ignatief and a lot of people didn't like the fact that someone who have been out of the country for 30+ years was leading the party.  I predict that with a new leader they will easily beat the NDP and maybe the conservatives too.  I think these results are one shot deal for the NDP.

The Bloc no longer have party status and don't qualify for funding.  The Conservative win was no surprise, but whether or not they got the majority was the question. The opposition parties forced an unnecessary election, spent hundreds of millions of dollars (our money) and in the end, 2 of the 3 were punished severely by the voters by giving the Conservatives a majority and NDP official opposition status.
