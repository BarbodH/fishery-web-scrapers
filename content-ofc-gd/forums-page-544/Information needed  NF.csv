577685,davew3,2011-04-29 18:03:00,430,Thanks Sinclair.  I will check it out.
577703,ADB,2011-04-29 18:44:00,444, If you give me a price range and style I can point you in the right direction.
577706,Fang,2011-04-29 18:48:00,1330,"For shows at Massey I parked at Victoria/Richmond St E. Google Massey Hall and there's parking 1-2 blocks south on Victoria. 2 nice tavern style restaurants right there, Had a couple good meals at Duggans but that was a few years ago. Enjoy the concert"
577708,davew3,2011-04-29 18:54:00,430,"  ADB,  price is not a problem for this night.  Looking for convienence and good food.  Thanks"
577710,davew3,2011-04-29 18:56:00,430,"  Thanks Fang,  will check this out as well."
577719,ADB,2011-04-29 19:27:00,444,Dave you have a PM.
577720,irishfield,2011-04-29 19:40:00,26272,Give yourself some time before the show and go down to Young and Front and eat at Houstons Steak House. Medium well for me please...  Find your parking place early and then walk down Yonge to Front is the best bet... or drive down Yonge.. left onto Front.. very next left and the underground parking garage is an unmarked entrance in the back of the building. $3 or something with supper receipt. Wish I'd know that before blowing $30 (twice) to park under the sports hall of fame.  Houstons is in the building on the N/E corner of Yonge/Front. Entrance is at the North end of the building on the Yonge face.

Figured we're only gonna be 5 blocks away sitting at the hosptial, so why not.  Ticket resellers at EIGHT times face value ($1448/seat floor).. I'll pull out the albums! What ever happened to Ontario's ticket face value laws?"
579036,davew3,2011-05-03 16:58:00,430,"Ya Irish, I know   ticket master sold out in seconds(?).  I was on hold with Massey Hall and exactly at 10 am I was cut off and had to buy the tickets through thier website at inflated prices.  But you know,  ""not doing anything illegal""  My wife is a big time Neil fan,  that is why I bit the bullet.  Have a good day all."
579042,irishfield,2011-05-03 17:06:00,26272,So where ya going to eat! lol
579082,davew3,2011-05-03 18:40:00,430,  At home
