578802,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-02 23:47:00,4399,"  Could you imagine Elizabeth May in the house of commons   she`d drive everybody freakin crazy, she`d have all the party leader`s so wound up they`d all be looking for a nice shiatzu massage!!!"
578804,12footspringbok,2011-05-02 23:49:00,459,Is it bad that my vote came down to eenie meenie miney moe?
578805,jedimaster,2011-05-02 23:51:00,3472,Just voted. Its not too late. This was my third time.... Lets go Jedi Party
578820,Jer,2011-05-03 00:15:00,1426,"  I think most ""blue liberals"" just might be voting Tory today..."
578821,Henricus,2011-05-03 00:17:00,118,"For those with children old enough to vote, review what happens to their eventual inheritance under each possible outcome.  That should clear up any confusion on which party gets their vote."
578824,mbosh1980,2011-05-03 00:21:00,349,Absolutely disagree.
578825,jedimaster,2011-05-03 00:29:00,3472,As a gun owner I really have no choice who to vote for. I will complain no matter who gets in though. Even if its the party I voted for.
578845,kickingfrog,2011-05-03 01:01:00,8333, I never thought of it that way. I'd actually like to see that because it would be entertaining.
578855,Handlebarz,2011-05-03 01:16:00,3790,Well I was kinda sad tonight as we usually bring the kids and Yes my 6 year old has seen way to many Fed elections already in his life. But this time he was sick so both kids missed getting to go and see how things are done.
578922,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-03 03:10:00,4399, You may get your wish Rob!!!

578594,Pikeslayer,2011-05-02 16:37:00,1443,That's all I got to say about that.  Slayer.
578603,bushart,2011-05-02 16:52:00,2628,Thanks PS---and double thanks for not tellin us who to vote for.  Cast mine this morn
578610,Roy,2011-05-02 17:01:00,13728,"Building and parking was full where I voted. From the time I parked till I was back in the car, not 10 minutes had passed. There was no one at my polling booth. PERFECT!"

578612,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-02 17:03:00,4399,I will be doing my part to keep the visiting professor and the champagne socialist from gaining power!!!

578629,Governator,2011-05-02 17:38:00,879,If you don't vote you can't complain.  Will be doing it this evening.
578635,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-02 17:44:00,0,"i'm encouraged by the amount of young people voting.  no quicker way to scare a bunch of bourgeoisie politicians than to see the youth turning out to vote.  and yes, thanks to anyone who didn't bring specific politics into this thread...  (i'm looking at you lookinforwalleye - no need for partisan jabs)"
578639,bushart,2011-05-02 17:49:00,2628,Right on da money Doc
578646,Grimace,2011-05-02 18:00:00,2020,I am voting tonight.  I have never missed a vote once.  I think that Facebook and sites like that help youth spread their ideas.  People in there early 20's are on there yacking back and forth and promoting thought and I think that is a good thing.  I think this could be a really good turn out.
578651,HTHM,2011-05-02 18:13:00,4082,"Voting or complaining? I have the honour of taking my just turned 18 year old son to the polls this afternoon. 2 more votes for our households party of choice. All of our children vote, it is un-thought-of to not vote."
578652,Headhunter,2011-05-02 18:16:00,5703,"Yes people, do get out and vote... however I do take issue with the above statement... in my mind, you have every right to complain, whether you vote or not, providing you PAY YOUR TAXES... that, in my mind gives you the right to complain. HH"
578654,EC1,2011-05-02 18:27:00,930,Did my part today. If you guys don't Canada might be IN DEBT SOON. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!

578663,irishfield,2011-05-02 18:56:00,26272,"We (5) all voted last Saturday. Jennifer and I stood in the advance poll line for over 40 minutes, with Jennifer tiring quickly as time went on and an older gentleman getting up and offering her the only spare chair in the place. If she can find the energy to exercise her civil liberty I challenge every one of you to get off your arse and vote. No ""party of choice"" in our household, they're all old enough to give it some thought themselves. Just because your father voted for a specific party doesn't mean it was a good thing !"
578665,Governator,2011-05-02 19:01:00,879,"  I meant you can't complain which party wins the race, not how your tax dollars are being spent.  Often races can be very close and if only 50% of a town voted than that means those that didn't can't complain because they could've made a difference."
578668,Spiel,2011-05-02 19:07:00,9065, I had the honour of taking my soon to be 19 year old daughter out for her first vote. I'm uncertain though if she followed in her fathers footsteps.
578670,Headhunter,2011-05-02 19:12:00,5703,I concur. HH
578680,HTHM,2011-05-02 19:52:00,4082,"Good on you all. As a parent it is my responsibility to discuss the issues at hand and give my children the tools they need to make a decision. If our dinner table discussions result in a single party being the one of choice, that is up to us as a family. Our party of choice does not even have a candidate in our riding, so we have to go to our second choice. It would be very nice if we could vote for whom we really wanted to vote for, but that won't happen until we move to the other side of the street. Our road is a borderline. My son and daughters are independant thinkers, they have pinned me to the wall many times with well thought out arguments. That makes me very proud of them and happy with the job my wife and I have done in raising them to be responsible adults."
578690,kickingfrog,2011-05-02 20:20:00,8333, Just what the this country needs... another green party voter.
578692,irishfield,2011-05-02 20:25:00,26272,HTHM.. you realize voting for your second choice just insures your first choice doesn't get in correct?
578693,splashhopper,2011-05-02 20:28:00,2931, agreed... and i do both
578708,HTHM,2011-05-02 20:57:00,4082,"When my first choice does not have a candidate in my riding, it is very difficult to vote for them. Ergo, second choice."
578711,Jer,2011-05-02 21:04:00,1426,   The Marijuana Party didn't have a candidate in my riding either...
