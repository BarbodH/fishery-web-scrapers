579379,Roy,2011-05-04 12:48:00,13728,You'll not be fishing because of one lake?
579381,Billy Bob,2011-05-04 12:54:00,5865,I'm heading up to my son's new house for the long weekend to do some work with him on the house...he's only 45 minutes from Oneida Lake....so it will be just a work party weekend....I will hopefully return in a few weeks to fish with him..
579412,blaque,2011-05-04 14:36:00,2419,Thats gotta be the worst case of bad luck ive heard in a while. Although you could always try the husky jerk bite from shore at dusk.
