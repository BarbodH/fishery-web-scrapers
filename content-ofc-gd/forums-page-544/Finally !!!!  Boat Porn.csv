578333,HTHM,2011-05-01 22:33:00,4082,WHAT! no water pressure gauge!?????
578338,irishfield,2011-05-01 22:45:00,26272,Have you not get that thing wet yet??? WTH ?

578394,kickingfrog,2011-05-02 00:37:00,8333,Get it wet! Get it wet! Get it wet! And then show us more pictures.
578405,mercman,2011-05-02 00:56:00,7054,Now the questions begin. Is a breaking in period really necessary?
578407,irishfield,2011-05-02 00:58:00,26272,Ah.. YES.. read the manual and follow the rpm suggestions as close as you can.
578408,mercman,2011-05-02 01:00:00,7054,Perfect.The salesman spent some time explaining the break in period so i just wanted to make sure it was a necessary step to follow.
578410,PikeMolester,2011-05-02 01:02:00,428,nice ride.
578465,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-02 02:55:00,1107,"Should have got a 2-stroke Paul no break in really gotta take it easy on the first tank of gas which needs to be mixed 50 to 1 then your all good and I'm on my third tank now ,ready for my first tourney this weekend still haven't got it slimed yet though  had this little guy land in the boat and hang out for a bit and then head back to were he was coming from we were right in the middle of Long Point Bay.

I am now looking at upgrading again to something with a full windsheild, bigger motor and all the tops and bling that go with it.  Guess what boat manufacturer I will be buying from?  You guessed it!  Princecraft makes one of the best boats hands down!  I will be a Princecraft owner for life.  Ab"
578626,corvette1,2011-05-02 17:36:00,1765,nice looking ride congrats
579297,skeeter,2011-05-04 01:41:00,1907,"Way to go Paul!!!!! I love the color of the boat. Your going to love that 4 stroke. Only problem with the 4 stroke is that when it is running you cant hear it,so before you turn the key to start it look first to make sure it's not already running and you forgot. Second problem is that they are so quite that all you hear is the water running out of the tell tail and that will make you pee every 10 minutes. I know this all to well...."
579304,mercman,2011-05-04 01:53:00,7054,  Roy said the same thing on Saturday.I better keep the bailing bucket under the console just for that reason
578138,HTHM,2011-05-01 04:04:00,4082,"Ya, but he has a tiller on the front..... Very nice ride Paul! I see why you were so excited."
578141,Rattletrap2,2011-05-01 04:15:00,1652,Very nice Paul! You can't go wrong with a Princecraft either! I really like the idea of the hand controlled (hand steered) bow mount trolling motor too. You should be able to just nudge it with your knee to keep things on course.  Enjoy your new baby and have some fun!
578149,Twocoda,2011-05-01 04:33:00,4130,Nice ride Paul...im miss the new boat feeling ...hope she serves you well for many years...what are ya going to name her?

I installed the electronics today.I put my Lowrance X135 on the bow, with the transducer on the trollling motor, and i installed the HB 587 Ci sonar/GPS on the console.

I saw this little gem in the showroom last summer, but decided to wait untill off season, and try tp save a bit.January 10 seemed like a good date.Walked in, told the salesman what i wanted and what i wanted to pay, and what i wanted for free. Told him when i would have the cash, and that was it Saved over 5K by buying off season. Here it is....finally.       Thanks to the Experts of Thomas Marine.They know how to make thier customers feels special"
