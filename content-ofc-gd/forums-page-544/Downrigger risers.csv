579520,anders,2011-05-04 20:04:00,1168,"hey guys...been a while since i last posted, but i got a question for the downrigger guys out there.  I just got my new boat (will post some pics soon) and i got two tournament walker downriggers. My question is does anybody know of any risers out there at least 8-12"" high that will fit the base of the walkers.  I know there are mounts out there that get to 6"", just looking for anything higher.  Thanks for the help."
