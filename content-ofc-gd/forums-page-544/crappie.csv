578752,skinny,2011-05-02 22:38:00,442,"well since so far my fishing season has been a bit of a bust creeks to brown ,port dover is brown, and my day out on long point bay in guess what brown water. I'm kinda guessing this might be the cause of the little to no action.  I have been thinking of going to a near by pond that is supose to have crappie in it to try for them. but I have never fished for them either what do you use for bait/tackle."
578756,miller,2011-05-02 22:48:00,223,minnows or microtubes under a slip float works well
578762,tb4me,2011-05-02 22:59:00,3295,we caught our crappies on a jighead with a 3 inch rubber minnow.
578768,kingofthesteelhead,2011-05-02 23:03:00,140,Make sure you fish shallow as opposed to some species which you fish just off the bottom.They are suspended and tend to look upward.Shad body and minnow body baits also work under a slip float and also just with casting under the surface.
578796,buckster,2011-05-02 23:33:00,530,I usually run my offering half (sometimes more than half) the depth of the water i'm fishing... For example 3 fow= 1 1/2 of lead or less.	Problem with crappie is that not all crappie lakes fish the same.  Good luck on your search!  
578830,splashhopper,2011-05-03 00:41:00,2931,garry2rs  put up a good thread about crappies a    ago
579140,Garry2Rs,2011-05-03 20:54:00,1425,"I use Crappie grubs that I buy from trout magnet in the USA. I also use their 1/32 and 1/16 oz. jigs as well. However any small tube or twister tail will work. In most cases 18 to 24 inches below a small float is about right. This past Saturday I was shore fishing.  It was sunny in the Kawarthas, the Crappie I found were around old Coontail type weeds in very shallow water at the back of the bay where the launch was.  On the Sunday it was overcast and blowing.  I found them in the back of windblown bays.  I speculated that the warmer surface water was piling up in these areas. If you are just starting out don't overlook live shiner minnows.  They are cheap and Crappie love them."
579143,skinny,2011-05-03 21:00:00,442,well once we get a weather break i may go try to get me some crappies I think I have the tackle required ( might buy some micro tubes) and i will try around the ponds in my area
