579011,fishnsled,2011-05-03 15:10:00,3520,Fishing plans already in place for those dates and a very hefty repair bill are stopping me from jumping on this. Have a great time gentlemen and will look forward to the report.
579144,Fang,2011-05-03 21:00:00,1330,"Oh Boy! this is the number 1 spot on my bucket list. I've got locked out from holidays at work from April to October as a new computer system is going in live for Sept 1. Wife is miffed as it means no summer plans can be made. Plus I just dropped a boatload getting the foundation dug up and waterproofed.  Have a great time guys! Be sure to take lots of pictures. For fun I just might pretend I'm going and pack up a tackle bag with several rod and reel combos. Now where did I put those Johnson spoons, bucktails and swimbaits  Solo, Grimsby tackle had some very cool large plastic baits in bulk when I was there last. All I thought was big pike way up north. I had to buy a bag of 8"" white sassy shads.  Very jealous guys - enjoy"
579160,solopaddler,2011-05-03 21:28:00,8605,"  It's a damn shame you can't swing the time off!  Seems to be a common theme although I'm sure the short notice doesn't help.  Thanks for the heads up on the plastic baits.  I'm good though. I've been tweaking, tinkering and accumulating gear for this trip since last September LOL!  Don't think I've ever been quite as ready for a trip as I am for this one."
579341,chris.brock,2011-05-04 05:15:00,4053,"it looks like a sunny, warm few days coming up for Nakina, should help melt some ice on Cordingly Lk"
579342,chris.brock,2011-05-04 05:19:00,4053,"I still wouldn't want to be booked for a lake, opening week north of Nakina/ Armstrong, anxiously watching forcasts and sattelite images  like solopaddler said, the big rivers will be fine though and could be a post spawn, pike feeding frenzy"
579348,solopaddler,2011-05-04 09:14:00,8605,  Fixed.
579349,lew,2011-05-04 09:44:00,12766,Your fishing tales are always fantastic Mike and I'm already looking forward to reading this one.  Good luck & have a great trip.
579380,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-04 12:49:00,2050, Ditto
579383,4x4bassin,2011-05-04 13:00:00,1025,"Ditto for me as well , You always have some great stories Solo and i'm sure this will be no exception ! Have a good one"
579394,Skud,2011-05-04 13:37:00,739,Looks like it will be 12 to 15 degrees for the next week up at the camp. That should do some damage to the ice and snow. I will still pack my parka though.
579426,Moosebunk,2011-05-04 15:17:00,3970," Never knowing that people would fall out of a trip, it actually pays if you can wait sometimes Mike, as things do happen.  Examples being, I remember when you asked me if I wanted to go and the price was $1500... now there's a deal at $1200.  Had I known then... or last year, Eddie offered up some last minute specials for OFC'ers at a great rate too...   It's the Skat people... good price offered and so loaded a pike fishery that even if they're on the spawn they'll be scarfing down your bucktail cheeseburgers while giving birth to millions of future trophy toothies.  And, if you've never had a quality Solo meal, I'm sure you'll be treated to awesome all week.  Sign on up!"
579625,RickOnt,2011-05-04 23:51:00,669,Hey MooseBunk  You are So Right!!!  When are you headed to Branson's aka Plummer's????  Rick
579655,solopaddler,2011-05-05 00:33:00,8605," Drew it's always been a hassle at least for me getting anyone to commit to a fly in, nevermind a group of 6.  Most people once they're committed aren't going to drop out.  Most outfitters Eddie included require a deposit to hold a booking.  So waiting in the hopes that someone might be able to make it is not a good idea.  Wish you were coming, we'd have a blast."
579664,Moosebunk,2011-05-05 00:45:00,3970,"I hear ya Mike.  Totally!  You and I should team up sometime, take on a place and see if we can get a dozen.  Imagine the stress. lol.  Will hopefully join ya one of these days, you know where I'd be happiest to do that.   Rick... looking like August.  Main Lodge and Tree again.  Boss' orders."
579717,RickOnt,2011-05-05 01:35:00,669,MooseBunk   You and Solopaddler  on the same trip!!!!  I am in!!  You only need 9 more!!!  Where do I send my deposit???   Rick
579751,chris.brock,2011-05-05 02:28:00,4053,"I'd like to read the report of that trip, Moosebunk versus Solopaddler, in the James Bay Watershed, in a head to head pike tournament  that's far more interesting than the NHL Playoffs so far"
579767,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-05 02:52:00,4399,pay per view Slime off 2011!!!
579808,solopaddler,2011-05-05 11:50:00,8605,"Both slots have been filled, thanks everyone!"
579825,fishnsled,2011-05-05 13:39:00,3520,"   Great news! Have a great trip, won't be hard to do. Looking forward to the report already."
579829,spinnerdoc,2011-05-05 13:56:00,556,Have a great trip guys hopefully a deatailed report. Tight lines
578540,solopaddler,2011-05-02 12:17:00,8605,"My group is slated to fish Eddie's main camp on the Attawapiskat river May 21-28.  Driving up on Friday the 20th, back (weather permitting) very late Sat night May 28.  We're the first group in camp this year and with this years water levels the trophy pike fishing will be as good as it gets.  Quite unexpectedly 2 members of our group of 6 were forced to cancel recently.  I've asked just about everyone I can think of with no interest so figured I'd post this publicly.  If anyone's interested in joining let me know!  Obviously 2 people that know each other would be best, but we can pair up two singles if need be.  Price is $1200 Canadian tax in for the week.  Cheers"
578573,Kingsalmon,2011-05-02 15:23:00,107,"Would love to go, but this damn thing called ""WORK"" keeps me from doing things I want to do.  I'm sure someone will grab the chance."
578575,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-02 15:28:00,0,If I wasn't going away the week after that I would have probably gone. Sounds like a great trip for anyone who has never been on a good early Pike Bite.
578583,Moosebunk,2011-05-02 15:46:00,3970,"The ice is flowing by Attawapiskat today.  Spring break-up isn't officially over I'm told, but close.  Cold water pike bite it will be.  Good luck gang."
578596,Abraxus,2011-05-02 16:37:00,104,Man you are killing me!  I have a wedding to attend on the May 24 weekend.  I was pissed that someone would plan their wedding for that weekend as is! Now I am rotten! lol  Ab
578599,Terry,2011-05-02 16:47:00,14456,if you posted it a week or so earlier I might have been able to swing it................that would be a great trip  I sure hope you fill the spots
578622,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-02 17:32:00,10439,  AWWW CMON TERRY!!! You can bask in the glow that is ME!!!! I'll even sign autographs!!!
578649,Terry,2011-05-02 18:08:00,14456,see another reason why I would want to go..... :+)
578691,solopaddler,2011-05-02 20:22:00,8605," You only live once.    Too bad Andy, bad timing.    A wedding? I'd bail on that for sure unless it was mine.  Still, someone I asked can't go because of a Gordon Lightfoot concert on the long weekend.   (Oh Gord...  )  Priorities gentlemen, priorities.    Just go for it Terry. Whatever's transpired in the last week can't be that important.     Easy now, you're going to scare everyone away!"
578698,rock34,2011-05-02 20:39:00,215,"Damn you Mike!!  I would LOVE to join you....Im in Vancouver for my annual conference. Have a good time....and give me warning when you post the report.  I will need lots of booze on hand to drink away my sorrows.  haha.  Dont get chances like this very often to those that can, take advantage!!"
578714,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-02 21:07:00,10439,"  While the report will fantstic I'm sure, but the HD video I'm shooting will be epic!!!!!"
578801,RickOnt,2011-05-02 23:47:00,669,Mike  Are you going into Beteau??? or Richter??  There is likely still ice on Richter!!  Rick
578809,irishfield,2011-05-02 23:55:00,26272,Damn chemo schedule and the unknown that goes with it...
578816,solopaddler,2011-05-03 00:06:00,8605," Too bad Rob, it would've been great if you could make it.    I'm sure we'll all bask in the glow of your video too, no doubt.   As mentioned Rick the main camp on the Attawapiskat river. (Beteau. Richter is not on the Attawapiskat.  )  No worries about ice.     If anyone has a good excuse not to go and also a real need for a trip like this it's you Wayne.    On another note for those who don't know, there is unlimited use of both satellite phone and internet at the camp.  A couple guys had expressed interest but were worried about being cut off from civilization for various reasons."
578819,danc,2011-05-03 00:15:00,4677,I don't know how you guys can't be concerned about the ice being out. I live hundreds of km's south of where you guys are going and have been iced out several times on May long. And it was one mother of a cold winter up here this year. Hope it all works out for ya's.
578823,solopaddler,2011-05-03 00:21:00,8605, The ice in the river won't be long before it's out Dan.  The only issue is the ice at the airbase in Nakina. It'll be out by then.
578834,misfish,2011-05-03 00:46:00,29133,"Thanks Mike for the offer.All the overtime money would of made it an affordable trip,but theres more work and overtime to be had. HAVE A GREAT AND SAFE TRIP GUYS.Look forward to the report and pics."
578857,RickOnt,2011-05-03 01:18:00,669,"Hey Mike  There should be enough water flow to move the ice on Beteau!!!  Not sure about Richter!!  Get the ""Big Guy""  The 50"" 'er is there!!!  I am working the 21st!!!   Trying to Save enough$$$ to go in 2012!!!   Who wants to go up in 2012?????   I have been talking to Eddie   We need Min 4, and preferably 6 to book a week!!!  More options if we have 6.   Mike do you or Doug want a Guiding Job!!!!!!  or Maybe I should get Doug's Dad!!!!  Rick"
578859,Handlebarz,2011-05-03 01:21:00,3790,This trip still sounds amazing and would be something to do before I die just not in the books this year.
578866,RickOnt,2011-05-03 01:33:00,669,Mike P  What about 2012???   Rick
578905,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-03 02:52:00,10439," Oh, it's pretty simple in this day and age Dan. A little thing they call the internet.  Here's some recent pics of the river. Attawapiskat PICs May 1 2011"
578909,irishfield,2011-05-03 02:53:00,26272, Someone could use some literary help though..
578915,lookinforwalleye,2011-05-03 03:05:00,4399,  Wayne if you read it backwards it makes perfect sense!!!
578925,danc,2011-05-03 03:16:00,4677," And here's the ice conditions in my neck of the woods, several hundred km's south of where you're headed, courtesy of the internet. I'm planning on fishing one of those white areas on the map. I still say that you guys are pushing your luck. I've been in blizzard conditions in mid June on the Winisk, not far from where you guys are going. Not wishing you guys any bad luck, but there was snow on my vehicles this morning and my furnace was running for much of the day here.  "
578955,solopaddler,2011-05-03 09:41:00,8605," I don't come cheap.  Living in Barrie I'm going to guess you must be a friend of Dougs?    Too bad Mike, would have loved to have you join us.  On the bright side your lures will be well represented up there this spring. They'll be put to the test."
