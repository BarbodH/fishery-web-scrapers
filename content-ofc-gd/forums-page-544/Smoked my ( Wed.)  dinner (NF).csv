I smoked & chopped some bacon for the dip, I dug some leeks in the morning, figured fresh ham & leek dinner would be good,especially in this ""tropical weather""   I made some leek dip,with leek bologna, crackers & swiss cheese, & ""taters-R-rotten"" ( Au Gratin), toss salad, & apple crisp ( sorry, only got a few pics)....
