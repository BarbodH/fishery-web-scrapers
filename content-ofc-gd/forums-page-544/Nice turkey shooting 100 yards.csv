She likes to play with the new cam more then me, and has had time to read the 150 page manual I printed off last night. Today she shot her first bird/birds.Toms and jakes.Frig me.  I think shes like to rub it in.  For those that know where I live,you know this is a 100 yard shot.Right from inside the condo. AMAZING.    They hang out in the bush by the A channel.      As I thought the pics were done,she says look at the last one on the cam.  SWEET, didnt even see it and it,s above my PC table. Thanks HUN.  Three generations.  "
