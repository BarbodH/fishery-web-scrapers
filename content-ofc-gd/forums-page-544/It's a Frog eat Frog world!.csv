578587,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-02 16:12:00,2050,Hey gang - I don't often post clips from The Show as I've gotten jumped on in the past for spamming... despite my continued support and participation on the board.... but I thought this was a fun clip from last summer!  We post vids like this at least once a week so check them out!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NK4nf_qIRE&feature=channel_video_title  Have a great week!  Ryan

578590,mercman,2011-05-02 16:24:00,7054,those big bully frogs will eat anything they can get into thier mouths ! I saw one eat a sparrow that landed too close one time. Never had a chance  
578591,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-02 16:30:00,0,Bull frogs eat baby snapping turtles. Another frog is just softer food...
578601,Roy,2011-05-02 16:50:00,13728,"Great clip, Ryan. Imagine if that frog would have turned into a prince though. Then Ol' Dave really would have had some splainin' to do not to mention the quart of Janitor in a Drum to wash his mouth."
578618,TJQ,2011-05-02 17:16:00,7806,"LOL.. thats pretty funny, and always remember, ""one mans spam is another mans klik"""
578619,TennesseeGuy,2011-05-02 17:19:00,957,"Hey Ryan, your dues are current, so keep bringin' 'em.  However................your boss kissing a frog is a bit kinky.  Kissing the frog that assumed the top position of a sex act is a lot kinky.  Might be a good idea to work on that one."
578695,splashhopper,2011-05-02 20:30:00,2931,This one didn't like my frog invading his pad  
579028,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-03 16:25:00,2050,lol say what you will about kissing frogs - Dave caught some pretty good fish that day after kissing that bull frog so if it worked for him.....
579040,newboykool,2011-05-03 16:58:00,81,"just bought 1 of those frog a couple of days ago, cant wait till bass opener"
