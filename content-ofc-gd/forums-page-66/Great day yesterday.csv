1027436,SirCranksalot,2018-04-26 02:17:00,3291,"Started dark and early---just enough light to see when we launched my friend Jim's 14 footer. Calm 'seas', just 1 more boat so far. Marked quite a few as we trolled 60-80 ft of water. Started with smallish body baits. I switched to Fire Tiger after about an hr and hit the first fish shortly thereafter. Jim switched to a similar color and hit several more. By the 'end of the day'---prob around 10 AM we had landed 7 and missed 2. It gradually became quite busy and Cap'n Jim got tired of dodging boats so we packed it in. Insert other media               "
1027450,Dutch01,2018-04-26 03:49:00,1431,Nice fish! Thanks for the pics.
1027470,BillM,2018-04-26 14:56:00,17367,"Nice!!!   I need to make it out that way, heard the fishing has been great since ice out.   How was the traffic mid week?"
1027473,SirCranksalot,2018-04-26 15:51:00,3291,"See my last sentence!  Mind you, Jim has little patience with crowds. He tends to seek out secluded spots---he's a canoeist, what more can I say??  ( I guess I can hijack. my own thread. What's your friend Borgerman up to these days? Some of Jim's buds are trying to talk him into a trip to the Sutton. I just sent him a link to MB's canoe trip report. I couldn't find any on his Dusey Lodge trip---just a foretaste here on OFC)"
1027474,BillM,2018-04-26 15:55:00,17367,I doubt he'll be back to the Sutton anytime soon.  Lots of stuff going on in his personal life unfortunately.
1027475,misfish,2018-04-26 16:06:00,29133,"That sucks. No hiding now Harold, I know what yer mug looks like now. LMAO Nice fish, but you are doing the bleed out, head detach, all wrong. HA HA HA"
1027476,SirCranksalot,2018-04-26 16:12:00,3291,"The blood is from Jim bashing it's head so we could safely remove the trebles. Bin dere, dun dat, got the scar!!"
1027477,jimmer,2018-04-26 17:02:00,2730,Thanks for a fishing report!  Nice to see someone getting out.
1027579,huzzsaba,2018-04-28 15:51:00,884,Very nice! Lake O was flat yesterday morning ! great day to be out on the boat.
1027582,SirCranksalot,2018-04-28 18:56:00,3291,Any luck? One of my friends has a boat on Lake O but says it's still to early? 
1027615,huzzsaba,2018-04-29 14:09:00,884,I was going to try fishing from the pier but the water was too muddy. No boat yet
1027666,BillM,2018-04-30 14:48:00,17367,Things should be heating up on the southern shore.  I know guys are starting to get into some chinooks.
1027669,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-30 15:41:00,2585,some serious chrome!  good job!  Cheers!
