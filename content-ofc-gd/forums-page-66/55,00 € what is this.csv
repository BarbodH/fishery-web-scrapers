1027638,adempsey,2018-04-29 20:06:00,1498,"Not sure what you're ordering, but I've ordered tackle from the UK many times. They ship standard post, so the shipping was always reasonable.  Maybe you can find what you're looking for there. Harris Sportsmail was always fairly decent. Most of my orders were from them. Although, the last time I ordered the exchange on the  British pound was relatively good (1.60 CDN = 1 pound; now it's about 1.77).  "

1027647,Tom S,2018-04-29 23:19:00,362,"I'm sure you can figure out something cheaper. Pair of binder clips for that matter. PS - some good deals can be had out of the UK & Europe. You're more likely to find a free shipping deal from Europe than from the US, they sometimes offer free international shipping and will honor it to Canada."
1027649,huzzsaba,2018-04-30 00:56:00,884,the other day I went to dollarama and the cashier accidentally gave a 2 euro coin instead of a toonie.  I noticed it many days later. I was surprised how similar it looks to the toonie. slightly smaller size but identical color with gold center
