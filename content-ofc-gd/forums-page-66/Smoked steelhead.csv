I froze in water but I can see some of the pieces are a bit freezer burnt. I'm not a huge fan of eating steelhead baked or grilled especially if I know it's been in the freezer that long. The question is can I save these fillets by brining and smoking them? I'm just curious if it's worth the time and effort. Have you guys had luck with finding older bags of fish and making them taste good by brining and smoking or is there a considerable difference in the taste. I don't want to throw them away. My experience with steelhead is that it doesn't freeze very well in ice for as long as I can freeze walleye and perch for. How long do you typically leave steelhead in the freezer for before it's unedible? Thanks!.....and yes I do own a vacuum sealer. I know ppl will definitely mention that haha

1027842,b_cdot,2018-05-04 02:55:00,270,any good wet brine recipes?
1027843,dave524,2018-05-04 10:16:00,4508,"Actually I've read that previously frozen fish works best for smoking, the freezing and thawing breaks down the cell walls allowing for better brine penetration. Go for it."

When a dry brine starts to cure the meat, the meat is being soaked in its own juices; not being deluded by water. Google dry brine for fish and you'll get a number of hits; that may sound good to your liking? Dan."
