1027537,Shloim,2018-04-27 17:23:00,515,"Was thinking of heading up, but have only been once before and can use some intel! "
1027546,BillM,2018-04-27 18:10:00,17367,Cats?
1027550,misfish,2018-04-27 18:56:00,29133,"Silly fella, Atlantics."
1027553,Bill Shearer,2018-04-27 19:44:00,456,"I'm betting that Monday will be the start of the better fishing. Was there last week, and caught a couple of cats"
1027556,LostAnotherOne,2018-04-27 22:40:00,956,Heading there Sunday.  Been a few years since last time.  New law i think that came out last year that you cant fish closer then 25 meters to dam.  All dams on the grand apparently.  Is this true?
1027559,G.mech,2018-04-27 23:35:00,830,"I think the rule you are referring to is not new, it's been around for a long time.  It is the second to last bullet on the bottom right side of page 8 of the current regs (snippit below).  There has always been a debate however whether a dam that is impassible to fish is considered an 'obstruction' or not as far as the intent of the rule goes.   The CO that I know insists that this rule is intended to protect fish that are trying to make their way upstream through a fish ladder or leap and that the if the dam is impassible, it's not a problem to fish there.  Many others do not share this opinion however.  "
1027560,LostAnotherOne,2018-04-28 00:09:00,956,Thanks for the info.   Cats are pretty much everywhere i think.  Guy i talked to at Fishmasters in Dunnville said it.
1027571,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-28 10:49:00,8243,"I was by yesterday, with all the rain the water at the dam looks like the US rapids above the Falls and the river is high and fast. I wait until the buds start on the trees to fish the river."
1027572,Rizzo,2018-04-28 11:45:00,4754,"I have a couple buddies there this morning, just got one small cat so far"
1027573,Rizzo,2018-04-28 12:45:00,4754,"just heard from them again...they are on, getting into a few"
1027639,LostAnotherOne,2018-04-29 20:12:00,956,First Dunnville cat caught today. 32.5 inches.  Love how it has its mouth open about to let out a roar lol.
1027643,Rizzo,2018-04-29 21:32:00,4754,if catfish weren't so gross I would call that one a beaut
