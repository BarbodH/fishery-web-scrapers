Jimbo turns to Bubba and says, ""You know, I'm tired of going through life without an education. Tomorrow I think I'll go to Community College and sign up for some classes."" Bubba thinks it's a good idea, and the two leave. The next day, Jimbo goes down to the college and meets Dean of Admissions, who signs him up for the four basic classes: Math, English, History, and Logic. 'Logic?' Jimbo says. 'What 's that?' The dean says, 'I'll give you an example. Do you own a weed eater?' 'Yeah.' 'Then logically speaking, because you own a weed eater, I think that you would have a yard.' 'That's true , I do have a yard ' 'I'm not done,' the dean says. 'Because you have a yard, I think logically that you would have a house.' 'Yes, I do have a house.' ' And because you have a house, I think that you might logically have a family.' 'Yes, I have a family.' 'I'm not done yet. Because you have a family, then logically you must have a wife. And because you have a wife, then logic tells me you must be heterosexual.' 'I am a heterosexual. That's amazing, you were able to find out all of that because I have a weed eater.' Excited to take the class now, Jimbo shakes the Dean's hand and leaves to go meet Bubba at the bar. He tells Bubba about his classes, how he is signed up for Math, English, History, and Logic. 'Logic?' Bubba says, 'What's that?' Jimbo says, 'I'll give you an example. Do you have a weedeater?' 'No' 'Then you're a queer.'"
