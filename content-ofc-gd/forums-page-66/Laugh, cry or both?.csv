I have just put my pressure washer in the bed of my truck and as she passes she says, ""oooooh, that washer looks different, is it a special kind?"" I replied ""no, I don't think so"", she says, ""maybe its just the handle, it looks different"", I say.......""maybe, but as far as I know it is just a regular gas pressure washer"", she then says, ""oh, thats probably why it looks different, we have a water one"".........lost for words I just smiled politely and carried on."
1027515,grimsbylander,2018-04-27 14:03:00,3016,"You really have to stop spraying gas! It's bad for the environment! So....the real question is, blond or brunette? lol"
1027518,limeyangler,2018-04-27 14:18:00,5204,blonde.
1027520,glen,2018-04-27 15:04:00,2641,Can I have her number.
1027521,limeyangler,2018-04-27 15:08:00,5204,She can't remember it..lololol.
1027523,AKRISONER,2018-04-27 15:24:00,5558,well...i hope shes attractive....
1027524,limeyangler,2018-04-27 15:29:00,5204,"Just for the record, I don't see her being a woman having anything to do with her dim wittedness, dummer observations and statements are made by blonde men regularly...just listen to Doug Ford for 2 seconds and you will see what I mean......lololol."
1027526,DanD,2018-04-27 15:51:00,2223,"Come on, she was hitting on you; why else would she be talking to you about your equipment? LOL Dan."
1027528,John Bacon,2018-04-27 16:40:00,3277,"Yeah, she thought his ""handle"" looked special"
1027529,grimsbylander,2018-04-27 16:42:00,3016,Is that your pressure washer or are you just glad to see me?? lol
1027530,manitoubass2,2018-04-27 16:45:00,11391,???
1027532,limeyangler,2018-04-27 16:54:00,5204,She was impressed by the girth of my hose.
1027578,SirCranksalot,2018-04-28 13:41:00,3291,She might have said 'you have a nice big one!' and the supermarket cashier said to me one time when she saw my big golf umbrella! 
1027584,misfish,2018-04-28 20:49:00,29133,"If she was, well then, 3/4 inch, must impress the wimen up there. LOL"
1027585,SirCranksalot,2018-04-28 21:27:00,3291,"How did you get that info, Brian? Did you measure it??"
1027586,GBW,2018-04-28 21:37:00,8460,At least she din't ask why or how you wash your gas...
1027587,misfish,2018-04-28 21:57:00,29133,I have a pressure washer SICKO.
