IT's  been a while since I have done the spring walleye . Any sign of the walleye coming in to the Bay Yet .?   Any info on conditions down that way would be helpful thanks ."
1026702,Stoty,2018-04-16 14:45:00,2910,Walleye have been in the Bay since November feeding all winter. If I were you head out of Hay Bay and into the main portion of the Bay near Thompson Pt & Sherman Pt and search for active schools of fish trolling with deep diving crankbaits and worm harnesses. Match the depth your bait is running to the depth of the biggest concentration of fish. Troll between 0.9-1.7 mph.
