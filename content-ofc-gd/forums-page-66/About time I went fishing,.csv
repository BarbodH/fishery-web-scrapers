1025650,bigugli,2018-04-04 00:24:00,6138,Finally got out after some crappie. Was a nice morning without wind or rain. 4 hours was all I could take in the cast.  Have to admit I love catching fish with my own jigs and floats.  
1025656,grimsbylander,2018-04-04 12:26:00,3016,Nice looking crappie. That's a slab down here.

1025679,crappieperchhunter,2018-04-04 20:06:00,2582,Well done Bruce!!!  I'm hoping to find some open water up this way on the weekend.
1025684,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-04 20:49:00,8243,"With the wind here if I decided to go fishing they would find me in NY. Nice fish Bruuuuuuce,"
1025694,Freshtrax,2018-04-04 23:02:00,2215,Nice feed.  Wish I had a local crappie spot.
1025697,misfish,2018-04-04 23:31:00,29133,You make floats now Bruce ?  Look at that  smile .
1025698,bigugli,2018-04-04 23:32:00,6138,With the Grand in your backyard???
1025699,bigugli,2018-04-04 23:32:00,6138,For a few years now. Simple balsa or cork
1025700,Freshtrax,2018-04-05 00:19:00,2215,Well ok...ive just been lazy and haven't really looked for em I guess. What areas of a river do they prefer?
1025701,PUMP KNOWS,2018-04-05 00:29:00,937,Nice one! I wish we had crappie of that size over here.
1025707,bigugli,2018-04-05 01:13:00,6138,At this timeof year look for the mouth of feeder creeks.
1025712,Moosebunk,2018-04-05 03:26:00,3970,"""bout time you went fishing! Hehehe!"
1026217,bigugli,2018-04-12 00:41:00,6138,Past week has been great for slab crappie and perch.  And its quality time I am spending with my daughter that is the best part.
1027137,bigugli,2018-04-22 11:54:00,6138,"Spent Saturday morning with the grandaughters. Got enough for a decent feed tween the 4 of us. We'll be doing a lot of fishing over the next 6 weeks as we registered into a 6 week multi species tournament with CFN.  DeeDee even got herself a 26""  carp "
1027139,DanD,2018-04-22 14:47:00,2223,"Great going Bruce!!!! My granddaughter is still way to young to come out with me yet; but I'll live the idea of via your posts; please keep your reports coming. On a side note. When your in London, I've got a box of wheel weights for you. Not a lot yet but the box is approx 12""X 4""X 3"" (LWH) and its all but full. Dan."
1027145,bigugli,2018-04-22 17:38:00,6138,"Guess I'll have to make a point of stopping by enroute to Windsor or Chatham.  Don't worry Dan, you'll be fishing with the wee one sooner than you think."
