1026632,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-16 00:25:00,2585,Last week I took these couple of pics.   So calm and amazingly beautiful.  It was a much different story today.  With the wicked winds and wind direction I heard the Lake Ontario Shore line in Oakville was getting hammered.  I took a drive down and wow I don't know if I have ever seen it this bad.  The waves are over the peer and the shorelines are washed out.  Pretty incredible power.  If you are from the area you will know where this is and understand how crazy this is.      Sadly this bass didn't make it.  This was 15ft washed in from shore to give you an idea of how far the water being washed in.   
1026634,b_cdot,2018-04-16 00:47:00,270,Great pictures
1026637,grimsbylander,2018-04-16 01:11:00,3016,Wow great shots!!! It's really hard to believe it's the same water. Who'd guess those last pics were taken in the middle of April??!! Worst spring I can remember.
1026642,huzzsaba,2018-04-16 01:21:00,884,woah!  that is where I fish usually.  Haven't caught anything yet lol.  Was there last week and it was smooth like glass! Have seen it crazy at this spot but never this crazy! Great shots!
1026644,Rizzo,2018-04-16 01:29:00,4754,wow those are some crazy waves
1026646,KawarthaAngler,2018-04-16 01:55:00,273,Very intimidating. 
1026649,HTHM,2018-04-16 02:33:00,4082,That's more than a walleye chop.
1026654,Dutch01,2018-04-16 03:52:00,1431,That's just scary. No way I'd want to be caught in that.
1026655,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-16 04:32:00,8243,Kooka munga surfs up. Those are some fantastic pics you got there my man.
1026664,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-16 09:21:00,2585,"hey I grew up fishing 16 mile creek and there are tons of fish there.  Bass, Walleye, Pike, Salmon, rainbows and browns just depending on the time of year.  All from shore!  Cheers!"
1026665,dave524,2018-04-16 09:40:00,4508,"Wasn't any better on the south shore either, I'm close enough that I can heard it and saw it from the end of the driveway, but I didn't venture out in that weather to have a looksee close up,  just heard it letting the dogs in and out. Nobody was fishing our  pier this weekend I assume. Just saw on CHCH 11 News some homes just west of the entrance to 50 Point Harbour getting hammered pretty good."
1026684,SirCranksalot,2018-04-16 13:08:00,3291,My buddy has got a 16 footer but it's a deep hull---so he should be OK out there!!
1026690,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-16 13:38:00,2585,To funny would love to see that.  I'm sure the coast guard wouldn't though haha.
1026752,huzzsaba,2018-04-16 22:13:00,884,"thanks for the heads up. will keep trying.  perhaps will bump into each other some day at the pier, or maybe we have lol."
1026848,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-18 03:15:00,2585,"hey there,  its been a while since i have fished the creeks and rivers in the area.  most of my fishing is done in parry sound and temagami now. I am down to the piers there just for the scenery now more then anything.  Pay attn to the birds.   if they move from the lake to inside the piers up the river a bit it means the baitfish they are feeding on was pushed into the creek.  if so that is the best chance at getting a day you will never forgot from shore."
1026851,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-18 03:21:00,8243,One Bass in the entire west end of the lake and it bit the big one.
1026854,dave524,2018-04-18 08:09:00,4508,"Actually there are quite a few bass in sheltered locations in the west end of Lake Ontario, mostly largemouth."
1026889,OhioFisherman,2018-04-18 17:04:00,6623,Lake Erie wasn't much better? http://fox8.com/2018/04/17/waves-damage-road-leave-debris-in-marblehead/
