1027498,OhioFisherman,2018-04-26 23:57:00,6623,http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Shimano_Sahara_FI_Spinning_Reels/descpage-SH.html http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Shimano_NASCI_Spinning_Reel/descpage-NASC.html Even the info on tackle warehouse indicates one is for freshwater one is for saltwater? Better seals? more money!
1027544,Tjames09,2018-04-27 17:47:00,664,I bought two 2500 Saharas last year. I really like them. Ive never one really high end spinning reels to compare it too though. But these were middle of the road pricing and the feel very nice.
1027554,Jds63,2018-04-27 20:15:00,1365,was looking at the higher end Shimano's but think i may go with 2 Sahara 2500's
1027555,boombap,2018-04-27 21:12:00,310,My new Daiwa fuego 2500 feels a lot nicer than my sahara 2500.. check it out.
