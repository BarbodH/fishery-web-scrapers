1027901,bigugli,2018-05-05 10:17:00,6138,We got away with minimal damage in our neighbourhood. 
1027903,DanD,2018-05-05 12:10:00,2223,"I lost a bunch of shingles on two areas of my roof. The first was at the back of the house and after the wind changed direction; the rest were off the side of the driveway. 5 grand worth of roofing 4 years ago all for nothing. So many other areas are partly flipped, I don't want to have it just patched; even though that's all the insurance will pay for. It is what it is; mother nature reminding us she's in-charge. Dan."
1027904,Tom S,2018-05-05 12:35:00,362,Yet those houses sell at prices that would justify plywood and metal roofs. Someone is going to make a lot of money in the next 20-30 year doing repairs to all these new houses.
1027906,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-05 12:58:00,8243,"Broken body and all we went and hit a few little white balls around yesterday on the north shore of Erie. I hit a drive 377 yards. Back into the wind the ball went maybe 75 yards! Buddy hit a wedge into the green and it ended up 20 yards behind him.  Yep fairly windy. Guys we have building houses in Hamilton like that since the early 80's. There was a time second levels could be 2X4 24"" on center. I'm surprised they are still standing. You can't buy one of them today for less than 600K. Many of those roofs and sheathing were replaced just 10 years latter. There was an entire sub division off of Upper Ottawa that had to replace everything 10 years latter. The residents filed a Class Action and the builder just went under only to re appear a few years latter under a different Corp. I'd rather buy a home build pre 78' then buy a house build between then and now. A fellow is building a place on the Lakeshore down the road, I asked him ""No Hurricane bracing?"" What's that? The shingles they put on 2 weeks ago are out in the bean field across the road."
1027910,huzzsaba,2018-05-05 15:14:00,884,Drove from Montreal back to Mississauga yesterday.  Most of the drive was just managing stay in my lane!  This was with a brand spanking new rental chrysler pacifica with 6 passengers in it.  Another guy I know was driving his semi from Quebec to Mississauga and had to stop in Kingston to rest cause his shoulders were hurting from fighting to keep the truck in control At one point we had to dodge pylons that were scattered all over the 401 causing major traffic jam eastbound near kingston.  Came home to find out gazebo canopy all mangled up  and other stuff thrown around. Weather has been pretty crazy in 2018.
1027918,PUMP KNOWS,2018-05-05 18:35:00,937,When did the winds start picking up for you guys? Just got power back 30mins ago and been out since 6pm. 
1027920,Lord Letto,2018-05-05 19:40:00,70,"I Think Power went out around 5-5:30ish , Came back on about 9:20-930ish PM so was out for about 4-4.5 hours"
1027868,misfish,2018-05-04 20:28:00,29133,The wind and the super gusts of up to 100 km so far is crazy. The CTV tower wires sound like a 747 is just outside here. Calling for even stronger gusts up to 115 km this evening.
1027869,Terry,2018-05-04 20:29:00,14456,Yup Crazy winds here
1027870,misfish,2018-05-04 20:46:00,29133,"What ever aint tied down or weighted down, Im watching fly down the road here."

1027874,grimsbylander,2018-05-04 20:54:00,3016,I had planned to fertilize the lawn after work. I'd probably end up doing all my neighbours lawns instead!
1027875,misfish,2018-05-04 20:57:00,29133,"I,ll bet theres 6 footers out on the lake here. Perfect for jigging lakers on the toon."
1027878,outllaw,2018-05-04 21:17:00,1232,that 25lbs I put on last winters saving me. I almost blew over.
1027879,John Bacon,2018-05-04 21:28:00,3277,It sounds like whatever you guys were getting just hit Scarborough now.  No evening fishing on Lake Ontario tonight.
1027880,irishfield,2018-05-04 21:41:00,26272,"I currently have 4 x 10,000 lb ratchet straps, 2 chains with bear traps on them diagonal across my hangars front door and 2 of my 3/8"" cross cables up to keep it from blowing over sideways. Direct West wind on 100 feet of 16' wall + the roof and I think the only thing keeping it upright is the fact my aircraft insurance is valid for 3 more days! Gusts are 90 to 100kph currently.."
1027881,Terry,2018-05-04 22:03:00,14456,My power just came back on  don't know how long it will last

1027883,dave524,2018-05-04 22:43:00,4508,"Lost power for 4 hours ,  2 sections of wooden fence blew off, just laying down and just need to nail it back , wife offered to help but told her too dangerous with this wind, we'll wait till the wind drops, I'll take the girls out on a leash until then.  "
1027884,misfish,2018-05-04 22:48:00,29133,"Looking out now, that wind has shifted, as the flags do tell. Direct out of the north. Here comes that cold front, and I do not like that mix."
1027887,pics,2018-05-04 23:20:00,1268,One gust at the Hamilton airport was reported at 127km/h.. all the new homes around us are losing shingles..of course they use OSB and cheap 3 tab shingles so what can you expect...
1027889,OhioFisherman,2018-05-04 23:33:00,6623,"http://www.cleveland19.com/story/38116640/thousands-without-power-across-northeast-ohio-as-50-mph-winds-rip-through-region Yep, hit here too!"
1027891,Spiel,2018-05-04 23:53:00,9065,It's all pretty quiet here just below the escarpment. Must be something going right over my head. 
1027892,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-04 23:57:00,10439,From a FB post on Ontario Tornado Watches page. A source is reporting to our own Sabrina vZ. that there is “HALF A HOUSE IN THE STREET” near King and Gage in Hamilton due to the winds. Has anyone else seen this or can share photos with us? Updates to come. - Brennen P.
1027893,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-04 23:59:00,10439,Good thing Mike doesn't work on Friday's. He would have been waaaaay busy taking measurements every 15 minutes with this blow!!

1027898,mikeh,2018-05-05 02:52:00,824,"a rental property on our street had new shingles put on in the last 4 years and the shingles were flying off the roof today, I noticed the plastic strips were still on the shingles, I always thought they were supposed to be removed before being nailed down."
1027899,HTHM,2018-05-05 04:07:00,4082,"Two fatalities in Southern Ont one in Hamilton, electrocution, DON'T TOUCH DOWNED POWER LINES FOLKS! and tragically an arborist in Milton."
