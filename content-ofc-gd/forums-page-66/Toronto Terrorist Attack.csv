1027366,Tom S,2018-04-25 14:20:00,362,"Awful to see. What dives a person to be so angry at themselves and others that they would want to do something like this? I'm glad that they did capture rather than kill, perhaps by exploring his motive and mindset there can be something done to prevent similar things from happening again. I'm not happy that we'll be housing and feeding him at tax payer expense, but if it prevents a death by similar motive then I'm for it. Besides, his problem is going to change from being Involuntarily Celibate to being Involuntarily Active."
1027367,Fish Farmer,2018-04-25 14:21:00,2234,Hope he gets his wish
1027368,Henricus,2018-04-25 14:25:00,118,At a cost of more than $100K a prisoner per year or approximately $6million (NOT accounting for inflation or including court costs) over his expected life span - the cop should have shot him.  That is one helluva cost for revenge against him getting his wish of being killed by police.  We should be able to opt out of taxes that cover this cost and those that are happy to see him rot in prison can volunteer to foot the bill.
1027373,FishFinder17,2018-04-25 15:49:00,139,"I understand that its' frustrating that we taxpayers are footing the bill for this idiot's jail term but remember that happens every single day. People get arrested, sentenced to jail time, and we pay for it. It's the way the system works. Not saying its right or fair, but it is what it is. I try to look at this from PC Lam's point of view. I highly doubt any of us on this board have been forced to take someone's life in the line of duty. It's more than just ""taking out a scumbag"". It's flashbacks, PTSD, judgement, time off work, and something he would have to live and deal with for the rest of his life. Instead he followed his training perfectly and we should all commend him for that. It's easy for us to sit in our armchairs and say he should have done this or that, but at the end of the day he did the right thing. Suggesting he should have shot him is giving police the power of judge and jury, and we've seen many instances where that doesn't end in an officer being celebrated. Just my POV,  FF17 "
1027375,AKRISONER,2018-04-25 16:05:00,5558,"does anyone here know why lesser dangerous criminals are not able to work back their debt to society like they are in the United Sates? I am just curious.  You drive down through the states and you see chain gangs cleaning up garbage out of highway ditches etc? Why dont we have these same programs in canada...man the 401 could use a good cleaning.  anyways...I think there is a line here that a large majority of people sit on where the death penalty is 100% ok.  I think my opinion is that in instances of open obvious mass indiscriminate murder the person revokes their ""life card"" and we just eliminate these individuals from the gene pool to try save some money. The problem is still that at the end of the day, its a damn hard job for someone to do, and someone has to do it. The logistics are not necessarily easy for the people involved to cope with.  Man oh man...that cop, what a brave brave brave guy he is. Incredible."
1027376,SirCranksalot,2018-04-25 16:49:00,3291,Excellent post FF17.
1027377,Dutch01,2018-04-25 17:16:00,1431,Excellent post. Agreed!
1027379,Henricus,2018-04-25 18:30:00,118,No doubt the cop acted incredibly and in hindsight did the right thing.  I'm sure many of the family members of the victims would have preferred a different outcome and had that different outcome prevailed we would very likely still be applauding him (the cop) for his actions. It is truly a unique circumstance and one that will be infinitely debated.
1027401,John Bacon,2018-04-25 21:04:00,3277,Government unions is probably one of the reasons.  They would consider that taking work away from the unionized city workers; and there is truth to that view point.
1027297,leaf4,2018-04-24 16:38:00,2466,Gotta wonder if he saw a large number of women on the sidewalk and just took the opportunity. Sad sad person.
1027304,OhioFisherman,2018-04-24 17:14:00,6623,"Hang him, dude should have got a blow up doll to take his frustrations out on!"
1027306,BillM,2018-04-24 17:53:00,17367,I hope we're not saying this is terrorism....
1027308,misfish,2018-04-24 18:06:00,29133,"Some will not like this read,  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-the-cop-who-didnt-shoot-shows-us-the-best-way-to-respond-to-terror/"
1027309,woodenboater,2018-04-24 18:21:00,2277,"curious, but why won't some like it ? police training and a cool head prevailed and is now an example of that for other forces. this is a huge win for TPS and deservedly so"
1027310,DanD,2018-04-24 18:27:00,2223,"I have mixed feeling about this. Yes shooting this prick, is what he deserved; but this cop did what is was supposed to do. He enforce the law and did it without becoming the executioner. Like someone else has already said, in cases like this, where there's no doubt the person did this crime; have him/her put to death. No insanity plea, if he's found criminally insane, there's no use for him in society. We put rabid dogs down; putting them out of misery? Dan."
1027311,Raf,2018-04-24 18:30:00,3495,"sounds like this kid was on the spectrum and his difficulty relating to people snowballed into something much much bigger and sinister. none of the above is an excuse for anything, it was a terrible act.  but certainly not terrorism."
1027313,Henricus,2018-04-24 19:16:00,118,"Condolences to those affected most. For every American cop that has seen the video he/she is saying ""...maybe in Canada but in my neighbourhood that cop is dead!"" "
1027319,SirCranksalot,2018-04-24 21:19:00,3291,"It sounds quite unlikely that it was a terrorist attack but let's see what the investigation uncovers ove rthe next months. I'm glad the police didn't shoot him. That's what he wanted. Let's give him lots of time for him to wish he was dead. Make the bugger suffer. ""bugger"" being a euphenism for the word I used! "
1027325,manitoubass2,2018-04-24 22:43:00,11391,"Agreed.  Just one twisted individual intent on killing.  Terrorism gets thrown around too much, as does mentally Ill  Ummmmm, if you kill people without a very very good reason obviously you are mentally ill. Thoughts and condolences to all those involved. And that police officer is one heck of a public defender."
1027332,BillM,2018-04-25 00:33:00,17367,"Yup, cop did a great job that's for sure.  Nice to see some praise instead of the constant bashing they receive."
1027338,Fish Farmer,2018-04-25 04:53:00,2234,Now we all have to pay for this individual for the rest of his life. Makes since to me. Did he feel for the innocent people he killed. The surviving families should be the judge.
1027339,Sinker,2018-04-25 06:34:00,8692,Agreed!
1027341,dave524,2018-04-25 10:55:00,4508," Naw , he will serve any sentences concurrently, he could be out in like 15 years    They will say he is no longer a threat if he stays on medication or some bullcrap."
1027342,lew,2018-04-25 11:01:00,12766,Just like the nurse that murdered the 8 seniors a couple years back. Everything to be served concurrently so basically she only got punished for killing the 1st person. I love this country but our justice system must be one of the worst and most lenient in the world.
1027343,woodenboater,2018-04-25 11:53:00,2277,"I have a feeling, since he's facing a huuuge stack of charges, that the prosecution will seek consecutive vs concurrent. I'll be surprised if he serves concurrent, if convicted of all ten first degrees and 13 attempted murder charges."
1027345,moxie,2018-04-25 12:13:00,1566,"Regardless off laws, given the sentiment I highly doubt he will evef see the light of day. Well maybe an hour a day."
1027353,Fish Farmer,2018-04-25 12:53:00,2234,"I think there's a lot of people thinking the cop should have squeezed one off. Now this peace of trash is going to think he's a martyr. Now the trash sits in jail getting 3 squares a day and full benefits that WE have to pay for. Are we not the victim in some way. Like to know what the cop really thought. we have to many cry me a river people. Wouldn't want a cops job, your a #$% if you do and a #$% if you don't. It could have went the other way if the trash had a real gun. 11 Dead. World is going down the pipe, how long before another trash wants to beat this trash. Sorry Bill, but this stuff really pisses me off, nothing against you bud."
1027354,woodenboater,2018-04-25 13:01:00,2277," Totally understand this sentiment but I'm glad he didn't. Btw, his father was an officer in Hong Kong so he must have learned lessons watching his father.  So let's say PC Lam did shoot and kill the driver, what that does is it leaves an extremely important question unanswered for the families of those who were struck. I know I'd need an answer to that question as it's part of the healing process and allows one to deal with what happened. If he's dead, that question will never be answered and will linger and simmer forever. I'd want, and need closure."
1027355,Fish Farmer,2018-04-25 13:19:00,2234,"You make a very good point. After said and done, Capital punishment comes to mind,  trash is 100% guilty."
1027356,SirCranksalot,2018-04-25 13:22:00,3291,he WANTED to be killed. Why should we give that scum what he wanted. Let his brain torture him for a few years!!! 
1027358,AKRISONER,2018-04-25 13:37:00,5558,i think its somewhat great that the guy didnt get his wish to die. He took an L in the end. I am sure that they have him in a nice padded room on suicide watch as well.
1027363,lew,2018-04-25 14:10:00,12766,"Another way to look at it is if he'd have been killed it would be over for him but if we can lock him up forever he's got everyday for many years to suffer in a tiny cramped cell with hopefully, NO chance of ever getting out. But unlike Bernardo, let's not allow him any comfort or enjoyment like TV or computer or anything to read....EVER."
1027364,NAW,2018-04-25 14:15:00,4022,Well this guy did all of this because he couldn't get laid.  Now he will be someone's bee-ach in jail for a long time.  Seems fitting.
1027365,Fish Farmer,2018-04-25 14:19:00,2234,"and food all out of date like 5 years old porridge, stale bread , rancid meat. dog food."
1027229,leaf4,2018-04-24 00:50:00,2466,Should've kneecapped him for fun
1027230,moxie,2018-04-24 00:57:00,1566,Exactly. Thats what i saw.
1027234,Acountdeleted,2018-04-24 01:42:00,2562,My co-workers mom saw the whole thing. She was a block away. Thank god she is alive but she says every time she closes her eyes she sees it.
1027240,leaf4,2018-04-24 02:10:00,2466,"I couldn't imagine that, I heard about a guy giving an interview shortly after it took place and he puked in the middle of the interview"
1027248,woodenboater,2018-04-24 02:50:00,2277,"I think we should hold back on the terrorist comments until we know the facts. Otherwise we call ALL people who commit mass murder terrorists, and I don't see that happening anywhere. What's interesting as well, there's possible Facebook postings that suggest he's part of the INCEL movement. Sounds extremely 'not a full deck' kind of thing and why he may have done this. Again, I can't see how he can do the math that leads to mowing down 25 people, leaving 10 dead and many who will suffer from ptsd. Can't even imagine the horror. Also wondered if he specifically chose that area of Yonge St. as it's also Koreatown and he possibly harboured hatred towards Asians. Dunno, but why Finch south ? "
1027253,chris.brock,2018-04-24 03:18:00,4053,"I appreciate your politically correctness, but mass murderer or terrorist, or Asian killer, whatever, same pos to me, this country is messed when a guy that does that gets defended, maybe he has a syndrome or something lol, it could have been your wife and kids mowed down, boggles my mind, I think it's sad what you're saying,I'm over and out on this one"
1027255,woodenboater,2018-04-24 03:31:00,2277,"def not a pc guy but I just don't like seeing that label thrown around so easily is all and no way am I defending him whatsoever. Very far from it. I was up there and saw the tarps and I've seen enough of this over the years that I'm losing faith in people as a species. Regardless, the guy deserves everything coming at him. Can't believe the cop showed incredible restraint apprehending him."
1027256,lew,2018-04-24 09:19:00,12766,"After the bus crash in Saskatchewan and now this cowards slaughter of so many innocent people, April has been a pretty sad month for Canada."
1027257,moxie,2018-04-24 10:07:00,1566,Ya if this happened to be for  the same reason as the one in the US a while back we have gone beyond senseless.
1027259,BillM,2018-04-24 11:37:00,17367,This wasn't a terrorist attack.
1027260,woodenboater,2018-04-24 11:52:00,2277,"absolutely and I really hope this is it for the rest of the year. please. I also see cities taking a hard look at open spaces and how they can be secured from these types of acts. Bollards and lots of them, esp at Dundas Sq"
1027261,Dutch01,2018-04-24 12:18:00,1431,"I'm with you on this one. To me a terrorist attack needs a political, religious or otherwise ideological motive. It appears that this was a lone loser hoping to take a few people with him while committing suicide by cop. Except he can't even do that right and got caught instead of killed. Of course, if info comes out later that he was connected to a terrorist group or motivated by ideological reasons, I will stand corrected. Until then though, I'm going with loner loser. "
1027262,BillM,2018-04-24 12:22:00,17367,We're on the same page Dutch
1027267,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-24 12:46:00,8243,"I don't get out much, I've never heard of this INCEL thing until last night. A similar motive in California a few years ago because some guy couldn't get laid. I don't get it. I'm sure glad I'm not in my 20's today. Thoughts and prayers to the victims, their families and those that had to witness this thing yesterday. Man what world do we live in today?"
1027269,AKRISONER,2018-04-24 12:54:00,5558,"ive heard that the whole ""INCEL"" angle might actually be a total hoax. from what I understand is that there is some issues with the timestamp of the postings vs the timing of the actual act. I guess it comes down to what people define as ""terrorism"" I stand corrected if terrorism absolutely has to be tied into a religious or political ideology. To me this individual committed a mass murder indiscriminately and inflicted ""terror"" on this entire city, hence I used the word terrorism. My girlfriend works where this all happened as well, she is very rattled by what she witnessed, multiple dead bodies bleeding out strung throughout the street. Not a good scene at all. So sad."
1027270,Headhunter,2018-04-24 13:01:00,5703,"My thoughts on this... there are a number of government buildings in the area and he may have been trying to make a point. There's a Government of Canada building, Armed Forces, TDSB Head Office to name a few. My wife's boss is at 5050 Yonge. Her comment via a tweet - ""Noone wants to see bodies laying on the street through there office window."" HH"
1027271,BillM,2018-04-24 13:12:00,17367,......or he's just a lunatic and wanted to be killed by police which seems like the case here.
1027277,Headhunter,2018-04-24 13:30:00,5703,"That's likely Bill, however is it a coincidence that he chose that street and that side of the street? The west side of Yonge from Finch to Sheppard is government row. HH"
1027278,BillM,2018-04-24 13:31:00,17367,I think it's just a coincidence.  But that's just my opinion.  Far better places to make a political statement then Yonge/Finch.

I'm all for labeling Islamic terrorism or white terrorism but this was a mass murder by  guy with a screw loose and an axe to grind.  	Also I don't buy the conspiracy hoax angle.

1027198,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-23 19:47:00,8243,Too early to say exactly the motivation but I think we sadly all know exactly what it was. Seconds ago CBC reports bodies seen on street covered in tarps. 1 man in his 20's arrested.
1027200,moxie,2018-04-23 19:57:00,1566,Do we know for sure? Scrap that heading till there is certainty ?. Thoughts go out to those affected and their families.
1027201,AKRISONER,2018-04-23 20:00:00,5558,"how is it anything but that? If hes white they might try and say he is ""mentally ill"" which is garbage...  The guy intended to do it, and now video is surfacing of him trying to get the cops to shoot him by repeatedly pointing something at them as if it is a weapon/gun...incredible to cops keep their composure and take him down. Theres no denial of intent here, he was driving down the sidewalk in a rental van running people over and then tried to get the cops to shoot him."
1027202,misfish,2018-04-23 20:17:00,29133,"WOW If the cops shot and killed, they would not get the answers they needed. Obviously the officer seen clearly what the guy was holding.  After that street car event, Im sure this is something that plays in the back of the heads of all officers."
1027203,AKRISONER,2018-04-23 20:22:00,5558,"2nd time since January toronto police have blown me away with their bravery.  A guy dropped a hand gun right in front of me on new years eve...I hear a cop say ""is that a gun?"" and then just absolutely levels the guy with a tackle...no weapon pulled and that was that...imagine seeing a guy with a gun and thinking, im gonna tackle him to stop him, balls of steel."
1027204,moxie,2018-04-23 20:28:00,1566,That was my first thought after the mention of three different incident scenes but to go there without confirmation But whether it is or not the only surprise to me would be why it took so long.  
1027205,AKRISONER,2018-04-23 20:36:00,5558,"the video now shows him literally saying ""kill me"" while aiming a cell phone or other object  to the cop, and ""shoot me in the head"" and the cop continuously tells him to get down. That about sums up the fact he did it on purpose...call him what you want. hes a terrorist in my eyes. Man the bravery...  Reports from law enforcement officials, the incident is being treated as deliberate."
1027206,leaf4,2018-04-23 20:44:00,2466,In our own backyard... Who would've expected it.  Amazing composure shown by TPS that's for sure
1027207,moxie,2018-04-23 20:49:00,1566,Again waz pretty obvious there was intent from the get go. given the three separate areas. long before we heard or saw any video or audio. Fact is there has been no confirmation.  Again thoughts to victims and loved ones.
1027208,moxie,2018-04-23 21:00:00,1566,All first responders need to be heralded here. They were on it hard and fast to help those in need.

1027216,misfish,2018-04-23 22:44:00,29133,"Dont get me wrong Chris. I would of like to see the dirt bag shot, but we have seen what happens to those that shoot and lose their jobs. So the the tax payers win, but the officer looses his job. CATCH 22 EH. I,ll take the, find what his demons were about, and the officer gets to live and have his job still. He did a great job IMO. Like I said, he was there and seen first hand, what was in his hand. All it would take is a close up of the guy holding a cell and being shot for it. Like I mentioned, Street car kid that was mentally ill."
1027218,misfish,2018-04-23 22:48:00,29133,"I will add, we need to bring back the death penalty for just this. If he is found not mentally challenged or it was terrorist, then death by injection."

1027224,chris.brock,2018-04-23 23:56:00,4053,Have you seen the video? It's a little different scenario than the kid by himself pacing around the street car for 20 minutes
1027225,Fisherman,2018-04-24 00:09:00,7201,"Yes, watched the video, looks like he is playing quick draw with the LEO, that is far beyond what I would have endured.  In the ascending order of use of force, it appears he is using an apex weapon (purported) pistol.  Double tap..the end. A completely different scenario that the lad with the knife, Sammy."
1027226,moxie,2018-04-24 00:16:00,1566,If it was a gun any of you think he would have been taken alive?  Like i said before. We dont know squat.
1027227,DRIFTER_016,2018-04-24 00:23:00,10439,It was his cell phone. Have read reports he was trying to get the cops to kill him by faking he had a gun.
