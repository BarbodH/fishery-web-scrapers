1026464,Tjames09,2018-04-14 20:03:00,664,"replacing my trolling motor this year from a motor guide 55lb to minn Kota 80lb. not sure if I should be going with 54 or 60"" length.  Boats a legend excalibur 16ft.  Edit: haha never mind, you cant buy a 54"" 80lb thrust. Mod you can delete this."
1026528,Garnet,2018-04-15 11:37:00,2056,Type of fishing you do most will determine what will work best for you.
1026538,moxie,2018-04-15 13:10:00,1566,"Ive been using a 70lb pd for the last 5 years. The previous one had a 54"" shaft and the new one a 60"" shaft. Good power and enough shaft so the prop stays in the water even with a decent chop. i believe they still come with a 54"" shaft."
1026542,captpierre,2018-04-15 13:20:00,2521,Can’t have a long enough shaft  ?
1026547,moxie,2018-04-15 13:35:00,1566,Thats what she said
1026562,OhioFisherman,2018-04-15 15:26:00,6623,https://minnkotamotors.johnsonoutdoors.com/powerdrive?id=13491  The shaft lengths available seem to vary by model and thrust.
1026563,Garnet,2018-04-15 15:31:00,2056,Most of you guys aren't watching FLW live today. All but 1 guy is using Fortrex cable steer because of what the are fishing. I will guarantee they all have the Unltrex and will use it if  type of fishing dictates.
1026568,OhioFisherman,2018-04-15 15:56:00,6623,"I'm not sure on what models that spot lock feature is available on, but it seems to be the new rage?"
1026577,Garnet,2018-04-15 16:41:00,2056,If T is a dock guy 60 inch could be wrong choice. Ultrex has spot lock could help but on docks they are noisy. Dragging tubes  or drop shot would go to Ultrex 60.  
1026603,Tjames09,2018-04-15 22:33:00,664," I was looking at getting the terrova 60"" 80lbs. Most of the models seem to all have the same/similar features. Looking for the spot lock/I-pilot features."
1026617,AKRISONER,2018-04-15 23:58:00,5558,"just like any lady will tell you, longer is better lol Let me know if you find any decent pricing, I am looking for the exact same motor for a good deal as we speak."
1026806,BillM,2018-04-17 15:44:00,17367,60in for sure.  You can always raise it... you can't lower a 54 any further then 54
1026811,Tjames09,2018-04-17 16:01:00,664,Best price I’ve seen is at sail. 2149 I think.
1026814,Lape0019,2018-04-17 16:12:00,647,"Seems like legend puts 54"" units on their boats right now. I would think that you would be fine with a 60"" though. I had one on my Bass Tracker and other than sticking way up in the are when I was getting super shallow, I never had a problem with it."
1026816,AKRISONER,2018-04-17 16:22:00,5558,"you will be able to beat this price, mark my words...i got one for our alumacraft for 1799 last year. 60 inch, ipilot, 80lb"
1026823,limeyangler,2018-04-17 18:54:00,5204,"I had the same problem last year when I upgraded, the decision was made easy, as you mentioned they only have the 60"" in the 80lb version, I was still anxious though that it would take up too much space/not fit right for my 16' Alumacraft, I need not have worried, it fits perfectly and the extra length comes in handy in choppy conditions. GO FOR IT!"
1026829,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-17 20:51:00,8243,"PG rated Brudder, but I almost fell out of my highchair. Good one, laugh of the week, thanks I needed that."

1026985,Garnet,2018-04-20 11:55:00,2056,I see a Tennrov  I Pilot on the CBF site for 1700. Sorry reread and it's a 36 volt. Couple more on BFB are 36.
1027034,Tjames09,2018-04-20 16:23:00,664,"I don't know what CBF is, elaborate?"
1027054,Garnet,2018-04-20 21:09:00,2056,Canadian Bass Federation you might not be allowed on site. The same one is on BFB.
