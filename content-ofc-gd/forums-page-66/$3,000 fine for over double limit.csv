1026761,mikeh,2018-04-16 23:10:00,824,"the first step should be to hit the ""REPORT POST' button to the right, or maybe PM the individual.  I would have liked to see the post in question edited but it's not my call. I think the $100 fine per fish is ok, banning someone for life for keeping too many crappie is excessive."
1026772,AKRISONER,2018-04-17 03:24:00,5558,huh??
1026803,BillM,2018-04-17 15:40:00,17367,"Wait, the 'White bucket brigade' is now a racist term?    lol so many precious snowflakes these days. The white bucket brigade is ANYONE loading their bucket full of fish, no matter the regs, season or species.   The nationality or background of that person makes no difference."
1026812,Acountdeleted,2018-04-17 16:02:00,2562,I think it was the ‘yellow bucket’ comment that is derogatory.  If white bucket is racist someone needs to fill me in on that one. My buckets are usually orange....... unless i’m Taking my own ‘black crappie’ in one.
1026830,John Bacon,2018-04-17 20:59:00,3277,"I can see where he's coming from.  	When people use the term ""white bucket"", white generally refers to the colour of the bucket.  White is a common colour for buckets.  	Yellow, is not a particular common colour for buckets.  So people interpret ""yellow"" as a reference to east Asians and implying that east Asians are the only ones that keep too many fish.  That was my thought when I first read the term ""yellow bucket""."
1026832,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-17 21:08:00,8243,"I couldn't agree more big guy. I have a question, what colour are the buckets of those of mixed race? Come on guys poachers do not have a specific ethnic background. Most are gone now but I have fished and hunted with guys that I loved dearly but they kept each and every fish they caught and each and every bird they shot. Their common denominator was they all survived the depression, WW2 and a few of them Prisoner of War camps, including my Uncle."
1026833,grimsbylander,2018-04-17 21:16:00,3016,"That's what I thought too. Oh well...if it insulted someone, it was not intentional on my part."
1026683,Mister G,2018-04-16 12:49:00,1429," Dutch needs to get control of himself as EVERYTHING ANYONE says that he doesn't like is racist to  him and should not be allowed because HE says so..........SAD... Now back to the problem at hand........just like many of us who fish in high priced boats, if we see a fish/game violation we do our best to report the violator to  the proper authorities. Time for those bucket shore anglers to do the same, don't you think ! ! !"
1026689,Dutch01,2018-04-16 13:32:00,1431,"You're welcome to your opinion. Until the mods put me on restrictions I'm entitled to mine too. Clearly at least some others saw it the same way I did as they commented as such. This is ""Ontario Fishing COMMUNITY"", comments that slander an ethic minority tell them they aren't welcome here, at least with some members. Is that the message OFC wants to be sending? And if you think there's no racism and I'm lifting up rocks looking for it, you are not paying attention. I often fish with visible minorities and you would be shocked at some of the things I've seen and heard. In the end, if you don't like my posts you're free to disagree or just skip on by them as I would do with posts that I don't find interesting. What I wouldn't do though, is tell you to ""calm down"" and try to tell you what you can and can't say. Unless you are making derogatory comments. Then I will chime in, but I'm sure you knew that already."
1026691,Mister G,2018-04-16 13:44:00,1429,"Well, now that YOU brought it up I would say not only do you lift rocks on any post looking for it but you also rake the sands to make sure everyone is on high alert from you. Again SAD......"
1026693,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-16 13:48:00,2585,The fine seems to match the crime in my eyes.  On our lake the ministry is telling us to take them out and not let them go as they are an invasive species.  (crappie are huge and tasty on our lake). That being said if you can't get a really good meal our of 30 crappie and feel you want to break the MNR laws then you should be fined and I am happy to see the CO catch this person and even happier to see he actually got fined.

1026708,lunkerbasshunter,2018-04-16 15:12:00,2585,"yep, not sure how a post about the MNR doing good has turned into an alleged racist thread with some trump thrown in for good measure but it happened sadly. We all need to go fishing I think!"
1026709,Acountdeleted,2018-04-16 15:15:00,2562,"Why don't they have a fine per fish? 1-2 fish over = $1000. Then $1000 per fish after that. This would have been $35-37g. That might hurt a little more. Although I like the idea of a lifetime ban, I get the idea people would just keep fishing anyways. 6 months community service or house arrest for repeat offenders? I dunno. Just spit balling ideas and my wish list."
1026710,Dutch01,2018-04-16 15:15:00,1431,I'm sorry if my post went over your head. There are racist comments on display right in this thread. You just seem to be unable or unwilling to see them. I asked you to spare us from an overused phase from a clown. It's not racist to say so to you as I don't even know you're white.
1026711,Dutch01,2018-04-16 15:17:00,1431,"On the day mods tell me I have to ignore derogatory comments I will do so. Posters who want to know how a thread about a fine goes awry need to look to those who made the comments, not to those who called them out."

1026716,farsider,2018-04-16 15:31:00,456,"We all take in information and filter it through our prism of lifetime experiences and personal biases. This thread was supposed to be about some enforcement for once. Most of all this frustration stems from lack of enforcement.  We see habitual poachers, call it in and nothing changes. Be it buckets or the gong show the river fisherman have to endure during the spawning runs for Trout in the spring and especially the fall Salmon run, or others.  Poaching with impunity and seemingly few repercussions. Little to zero enforcement breeds more frustration.  We play by the rules and respect the resource for future opportunities but see others abusing at will. I was glad that some enforcement was taking place. Although, the punishment seemed low, I guess there would be less guilty pleas if the vehicle was taken and fines where higher. I am glad Dutch has called in the habitual abusers he has encountered when he night fishes.  He must know first hand the frustration that results after nothing changes even after he has repeatedly called it in. Cheers, Mark "

1026351,grimsbylander,2018-04-13 18:44:00,3016,$3000 lol another joke fine and no fine. haha just typing the same thing!
1026352,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-13 18:52:00,8243,"I read about this on MNR Watch. Disgusting to say the least. It appears fines being levied now are much more punitive than I have read about in the past and still just a slap on the wrist. I believe they should throw the book at each and every poacher out there. Some of the fines to deter poaching is a joke, not just some I should say mostly all.  In the 3 years or so that I get the reports I have never ever heard of someone loosing their vehicles,  boats, sleds etc. A few have forfeited there guns. When punitive measures only really hurt the criminal will they get to the point it is a deterrent to poach for them and others. Big deal a guy gets a $500.00 fine and looses his Fishing license if he or she ever had one to loose in the 1st place. They sell the fish and game so a small fine is no big deal. Just a part of doing business to these morons. Rant complete. I highly recommend you all to get the monthly newsletter MNR Watch sends out if you already haven't. It may be disturbing. Hunting, fishing and environmental charges and fines are passed on to the public. They aren't affiliated with the MNR or MOE. They just pass on the news and MNR reports and rulings to you every month."
1026370,Tjames09,2018-04-13 20:47:00,664,Do they not care about the regs?
1026371,BillM,2018-04-13 20:53:00,17367,Does the white bucket brigade ever care about the regs?
1026373,grimsbylander,2018-04-13 21:07:00,3016,"They need to absolutely hammer one of them to send a message. This same old slap on the wrist stuff isn't working. He didn't friggin walk there...take his car, place a fine and take away his license. Trust me, the white brigade community will hear all about it."
1026414,Dutch01,2018-04-14 11:54:00,1431,"Before this thread goes off the rails, I see locals doing more damage to the fishery more often than anyone. I'm not saying I agree with this fellow keeping more than his limit, but it would be nice if people made it about his actions and not his race. I fish a river in the Kawarthas, always at night. I regularly (almost every time there) see white guys take off in their truck after catching a fish then come back in 5-10 minutes. I'm betting there are slot fish in their freezer at home but I don't blame all white people for their actions. Oh yeah, I'm white, live in Markham, and follow the regs. "
1026415,dave524,2018-04-14 12:16:00,4508,"Thought it a bit excessive, for a long time there was no limit on Crappie , they were considered an invasive species like Rock Bass in some lakes, a guy shoots a doe without an antlerless tag and gets $1250 on the same page , now that seems backwards to me."

1026500,buick14,2018-04-15 01:36:00,741,I will have to back up all of my “yellow bucket brigade” friends.  Too far.  Dirty arsed “white” buckets are as bad or worse IMO.  C’mon I assume you didn’t mean what u said.
1026534,Dutch01,2018-04-15 12:40:00,1431,I agree it's racist. Yellow or white bucket brigade is a derogatory term generally used to describe Asian shore fisherman and to imply they don't follow the regs and just fill their bucket. I think this site is meant to be for all and we shouldn't tolerate the furthering of stereotypes that could offend OFC members who are Asian. Of course that is up to the mods as I don't own the site.
1026535,Dutch01,2018-04-15 12:43:00,1431,"To be clear, I'm not saying ""hang 'em high"" and calling for a ban or anything. I'm just hoping people will think before they post."
1026550,AKRISONER,2018-04-15 13:37:00,5558,"No different than the dang white trash I see up north taking slot eyes all fall. Limiting out, going home, offloading and heading back out for another set of fish. It’s all the same friggin garbage and it needs to stop."
1026553,Dutch01,2018-04-15 13:56:00,1431,"I agree, and I have noted the same behavior in my post above. I also noted that I don't hold that against all white people.  We should be calling out behavior and not colors. I am certain there are Asian members of this site. I don't think they should have to tolerate derogatory comments in order to visit the site. Here are two ways one could respond to the original post, I know which one should be allowed here: ""dam yellow bucket brigade, always keeping over their limit. They should go back to Markham"" ""It really makes me sick seeing people not obeying the fishing regs. They ought to throw the book at him for keeping more than his limit"". One response calls out wrong behavior, the other is a knee jerk slur against an entire people in response to a report on the actions of one person. "

1026640,grimsbylander,2018-04-16 01:19:00,3016,I thought the white bucket brigade were the guys that fished live bait only and used those Home Depot style white paint buckets for minnows and to fill 'em up?? lol What does white bucket have to do with race?
1026653,Dutch01,2018-04-16 03:50:00,1431,"It's a pretty widely known reference. Most anyone I know or fish with would know what is meant by it. The comment about Markham (a very mixed ethnic community) appears to be meant to clear it up, in case anyone want sure. Glad to hear Akri, who I've talked to in PM before and know to be a good guy, didn't mean it that way."
1026656,scuro2,2018-04-16 04:39:00,904,As I have said before the only poaching of fish I've ever seen was done by Americans. I could say they were the cooler brigade ( beer goes into camp and a cooler worth of fish fillets leaves the camp ). I could harp on Americans every time an American is caught poaching fish....but then that would be really jerk like and why? Unless someone is going to state with evidence that the vast majority of all poachers are one group only can we just stop with racist tinged threads? That goes double for native racist tinged threads.
1026657,Old Ironmaker,2018-04-16 04:42:00,8243,"If you get the MNR Watch reports you will find that the most fined are not those with Asian surnames in the near north i.e. Nippising, most have French surnames. I personally didn't know what is meant by ""white bucket brigade"" other than those that fill them. Italian, Croatian, Serbian. Polish, French, Irish, Scottish, American, Klingon or anyone else."

1026679,pics,2018-04-16 12:08:00,1268,The fine seems to be in line with the offence this time.. 3 thousand dollars is a lot for too many crappie. They are one of my favourite fish but in most lakes they are actually invasive. Hopefully this sends a signal that limits will be enforced...
