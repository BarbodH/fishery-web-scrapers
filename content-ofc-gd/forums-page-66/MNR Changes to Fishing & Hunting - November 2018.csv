Details -> https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-outdoors-card#section-7  Items taken from the email newsletter: This November we're making updates to our licensing service. Our goal is to make it easier for you to buy fishing and hunting licences. A couple of exciting features in the new service include: Next, we're making improvements to some fishing and hunting rules. Fishing regulation changes will come into effect in November 2018, and hunting regulations will change in January 2019. Here are some things that will be different for hunters:"

1027382,AKRISONER,2018-04-25 18:56:00,5558,wouldnt you still need to be carrying your outdoors card though? I 100% would be on board for being able to display my stuff on my phone. I never go in the boat without a lifeline.
