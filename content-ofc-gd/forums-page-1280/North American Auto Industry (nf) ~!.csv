27398,OhioFisherman,2007-01-28 01:35:00,6623,"Cookslav, I had a 1986 chevette can`t say anything bad about it. I bought it used for like 1300 bucks and had it around 10 years. The timing belts would wear out but were easy to fix. Gas milage was good and I didn`t need to drive a fancy car to have it parked in the lot at work for 10 to 15 hours a day.  Never owned a foreign car, never had too many problems with the American built cars I have bought. I buy them used and drive them till they die or I find something better at a good price.  I am just guessing, but if chinese workers were allowed to speak they might not be real happy with their working conditions. A lot of the products you buy now come from countries that don`t let their workers have much say, or choice."

27605,bullybass,2007-01-28 15:30:00,144,I wholeheartedly concur that the big 3 are in definite trouble... however blaming things like worker salaries seems a bit ridiculous. The last time I checked it cost on average $300 000+ to purchase a house... $25 000+ to purchase a new car( nowhere near top of the line car ) how do we afford these things if our salaries are not commensurate with today's cost of living??? How many banks are going to say oh I see you work at the local restaurant making minimum wage plus tips... sure you qualify for a $300K mortgage... ya right. If the auto industry decided that the workers were getting too much and cut salaries and pensions what would happen?? Would the prices of their vehicles come down??? Heck no??? Their profits would soar and the upper management would reap the immense rewards that would no doubt come from this. If you look at the GM model... the union and company went to the members and in the face of Oshawa car plant shutting down asked for concessions on their current contract to secure future contracts and the members voted to do what they can to secure their jobs for the future of the company and of course for their future... so it is not all greed and  more more more!!!!  GM has seen that there are problems... like warranty and have done something about this finally. They now have the best warranty in the industry on all there products.  They are in fact listening to the consumer. Now they just need to think about their design department and realize that they need to make an impressive looking car in order for today's consumer to want it. Like say the Camaro.... hopefully it will not be priced way too far out of people's budgets.  Just my two cents.... may not be worth one but hey there it is.
27647,Gary George,2007-01-28 16:38:00,33,"Unionism was born out of communism.  We all know how successful that experiment was.  Ethics are the root of the problem overall.  Niether management nor unions apply quality ethics to the inustry.  That is the biggest thing that sets the successful companies apart in this.  President of Toyota, when told that his company was about to surpass GM replied with something to the effect of; that is not our goal, our goal is to make quality vehicles.  Being the biggest means nothing, being the best does and that is the glaring difference, the big 3 are far to focused on being the biggest."
27670,danc,2007-01-28 17:26:00,4677,"You have to consider planned obsolescence in the equation too. If they made vehicles that never needed repairs and  lasted forever, they wouldn't be selling many parts or new vehicles in the future. But just how far do you go with this? I'm sure they could put a much better product on the market if they really wanted to."
27678,fishforfun,2007-01-28 17:50:00,105,"There are 4 of us in my immediate family that work in the auto industry, we all drive NA vehicles. As a self employed tool maker I'm in and out of a lot of parts manufacturers plants as well as assemby plants. Quality Control is the highest priority in all these plants  but 100% inspection is impossible and that applies to all manufacturers not just the big 3. The 1st thing the NA manufacturers need to straighten out is the relationship they have with their dealers. The majority of people who have problems aren't upset with quality, you can replace defective parts, it's service. The dealership is the front line representing the manufacturer and personally I wouldn't have a lot of them representing me. Very good discussion with some good thoughts going on here!"
27680,seeking54,2007-01-28 17:51:00,11,"So true RivRat! The Japanese view their bottom line as satisfying a need! Remember the old saying: find something you're good at and the $$$ will follow?  Even that GM is a publicly traded company,  they’re backed by the U.S Government, they know it and the Unions know it, that explains why they are indifferent about their products ……….If their stock was doing well,  like my Bank stock which tripled in the last 15 years……one could say well I’m making money with their stock!! But that‘s another topic……bring on the service charges .  True, Dan…….we saw it with the GM 283.  The power train has to be bullet proof, and the vehicle safe. Everything else is of no consequence."
27748,glirw,2007-01-28 20:54:00,200,"Our last vehicle purchase was a Hyundai .  We walked into Ford first , aggressive sales person wanted to push us into buying and when we told him that we are still comparison shopping he said : "" okay go do your shopping then come back if you are still looking ""  I tried to tell him that we want to stay and see what ford has to offer for a compact SUV or station wagon , he said , no , please , come back and see us after you're done .  I will never set foot in that dealsership again  .  Nextt stop was Dodge , got into the caliber , it was small uncomfortable and felt very cheap , and they didn't have any other cars that were fuel efficient  and attractive.  Chevy had a decent station wagon , but after we test drove it we were turned off . loud  and uncomfortable compared to the Hyundai Tucson that we ended up buying . What's more , Hyundai gave much better warranty , and the car simply feels sleek , smooth  , very fast for a 4 cylinder , and fully loaded from the box so to speak . Yes the Chevy was a TAD cheaper , but not enough to justify switching . Besides , even if it's cheaper , the value for the money was still better at Hyundais.  My personal story anyway. To add onto that : Had a dodge caravan 1994 , good car ,  used it for a few years , upgraded to  a 2000 Chevy Venture , decent car , bad electronics (check engine 24/7) , unexpected service here and there (some valves that kept breaking , etc) , sold that and upgraded to a leased Tucson .  I still drive a 1996 Chrysler Cirrus  , it's an old car no doubt , with around 260,000 clicks , still going alright though  , but definately soon to be moved to the scrapyard."
27749,OhioFisherman,2007-01-28 20:56:00,6623,"Unionism born out of communism? I guess that is one way of looking at it, sort of like our Union of states? We got tired of unfair taxation and had a little revolution? LOL  Actually if you wait for your employer to better your standard of living it might be a long wait. Even when Henry Ford raised the Auto workers pay to 5 dollars a day he had reasons behind it. He couldn`t keep employees, employee turn over was near 50%, and there were standards you had to meet to get that pay, a social engineering project. China probably doesn`t have that problem, show up here, work, or don`t eat, if that doesn`t work we have stronger measures.  Not a communist myself, and from what I have seen and read there hasn`t really been any true communist countries, just people fighting for control and calling it that.  Great debate though, you can disagree, and stay civil, LOL and friends. Most of us are stuck with what happens around us."
27224,wuchikubo,2007-01-27 15:00:00,1114,"I'm definitely not a supporter for unions, after looking at how foreign companies (referring to mostly Japanese) that make cars that don't have unions, it makes more sense for large companies that can see the benefits of keeping their staff happy so that they don't have to think about unions. Having said that, workers also have to reflect upon how the employer looks at the situation, what would a worker do in the position of an executive since their on the front line but need to relook at how to keep the company moving forward instead of treading in water. In the Big 3 cases, it seems more like how fast they can bail water out as the ship is sinking.  Keep in mind that foreign companies have also built auto plants here in Canada and have been producing good product as well. And correct me if my knowledge is outdated, but the last time I heard of a japanese plant looking at unionizing it was voted against by the worker, thus no union!  IMO, non-unionized companies have provided better product, better service, and a better bang for the buck.  HF"
27231,Benthook,2007-01-27 15:47:00,56,I'm likely getting way ahead of myself now....imagine that eh  but the simple fact that there are no union's organized in these Japanese automotive plants keeps there employee's wages high enough and happy enough to work there...who on earth is to say that when the poop really hits the fan and at least one or two of the three American based companies goes down the drain that these companies like Toyota and Honda are at that point untouchable and won't have your happy go lucky jobs for you and replaced by there own ethnicity citizens of Canada hence the lack of job security set up through a union~?   but given that there probably smart enough not to do such a thing but grow all the trickle down business's at that point with us only pointing fingers at each other for all the mistakes we made~!
27234,Jer,2007-01-27 16:04:00,1426,I would hope that any major auto manufacturer (of any origin) wouldn't base their hiring practises on race (at least in this country). I'm sure that would be considered highly illegal and unethical and just wouldn't fly.
27236,Benthook,2007-01-27 16:18:00,56,"So true Jer....just all their business affiliates down that ladder could then benefit as they did. It's hard to set up a business and grow it and make it successful. It's easy however at that point to purchase off whomever you want for all your products, services, and supplies that makes your business run successfully. I for example buy from and support family and friends and close acquaintances...I'm only assuming they will do the exact same thing...perhaps not yet...cause that's part of there whole scheming ingenious plan and when they do get in that big of a power position to do so without us being able to do much about it but watch they will do it, hands down...that I promise~!  If my vending business grew to such a degree and my cousin opened a wholesaler local to me do you honestly think i'm going to support my cousin or do you think i'm going to keep buying off the wholesaler I have used up until that point  You assumed right I would choose my cousin in a heart beat  Or an even smarter approach would be to open my very own wholesaler because at that point I would own a huge portion of my existing business to then employ my family, friends, and/or acquaintances~!  Bottom line here is....fact of reality the Chinese are taking over strong and fast...so as far as I'm concerned if you work for or supply Ford or Chevrolet and something isn't done like insanely quick about this current situation you have better have wished you strap on your best padded hockey pants cause when the Chinese finally pull the carpet from under your skate's these highly priced jobs at these North American lack lustre companies you or someone you know is gonna hurt more then just their tailbones~!  I guess at this point it's just something we all have to come to terms with....sad reality~!"
27237,Tybo,2007-01-27 16:22:00,1373,"People that think N.A are crap have no clue what they are talking about. I'm a heavy equipment tech by trade. I work out of the CP intermodel yard in vaughan. A lot of the cp employees come up to ask us about vehicle problems. 90% are imports with low kms. Most are still under warranty, they just want to know what before they take it to the service mechanic so the job gets done right.   Recalls on N.A vehicles were unheard of until they started to use imported parts. No one can make steel like Canada can. Unfortunately it's expensive.  For the 07 year, Japan, Korea and Germany all had cars denied to the N.A market. Due to either not making emmission or safty standards. Remember these cars are built for export.  And here is another, 93 lumina sitting in my drive. The lumina was a piece of crap compared to imports. So why do you see more luminas on the road compared too old imports.  Also a lemon is a lemon. It doesn't matter whose tag is on it.   A 17 billion doller loss to a trillion doller corporation is like you losing 17 bucks.   HAVE A NICE DAY."
27256,Cookslav,2007-01-27 17:53:00,1457,"Totaly agree.  I drive nuthin but NA.. Chev actually, and I've never had any issues.  My First Car was a 83 Chevette I bought for $1200.... I drove that thing into the ground, and finaly had to give her up because an accident compriomised the frame, I think I'd still be driving that little spark plug if it wasn't for that accident...well maybe not now LOL  2nd car was a 1993 Chev Cavalier....ran it up to 375,000kms It was used I bought it for $5500, and The only thing I bought for it was Gas oil, and a couple of tires, then I had a family and needed something bigger, and I figures the time was right...but I could very well have gone years longer wioth that car.  Third car errr...Van is a 2001 Chevy venture I picked up for $9000....still going strong, high milage, not a single issue, not single complaint.  My Uncle is a mechanic... I buy all my cars from him, because he knows his stuff. He works on my cars for free...If I need anything done I pay for the parts. He refuses to buy foreign cars for that very reason. He doesn't want to spend all his free time fixing my car for free.  His confidence in NA cars speaks volumes...   Funny part is when I compare my dollar to years ratio versus most of my freinds... I've been driving Chev cars since 1992 and spent a grand total of $15,700 And maybe $2000 of maintenence.  I don't have a single friend or aquaintance to my knowlage who is not driving a car currently that they paid more then that for... And if not I gaurentee they doubled or tripled My dollar per year ratio driving imports...not mention twice the headaches. My wife is still driving her 1995 Sunfire...issue free. A few minor repairs such as windshied wipers, and a leak in a fuel line...but other wise still a good reliable cost effective car.  But I guess I could just be reeeeely lucky"

26850,SHAD,2007-01-26 15:42:00,134,"What's wrong with the N.A. Auto Industry, hmmmmm...TONS!  Today's consumer is alot different the last decade then it was 25-50 years ago.  We are in the information age, word of mouth is not just what your neighbour or co-worker has to say anymore.  The internet has made searching for a vehicle and finding vehicle reviews and consumer ratings at the click of a mouse.  What this boils down to; is consumer loyalty.  I have owned 4 vehicles in the last 15 years.  Of those 4 vehicles, one was a domestic, a 1987 Ford Tauras.  This was my first vehicle and the last Ford I will ever buy.  Since I've owned a Toyota Corrolla, Honda Civic SiR and currently own an Infinity QX4.  I don't think all of these import vehicle's combined have cost me as much in maintenance/repairs as that one Ford Tauras did.  My point, N.A. manufacturers will continue to lose money in N.A. because there business model is not constructed around the consumer.  Someone nailed it on the head in an earlier reply; N.A. manufacturer's have only a few staple models, they are constantly renaming a model or making a new model vehicle.  Look at Honda, Toyota and Nissan - all three have at least two main 4 cyclinder cars and one or two main SUV/trucks and they don't change or rename these main vehicles; they continue to improve them.  I honestly believe that N.A. manufacturer's build vehicle's that are designed to fail the consumer after x amount of km's.  That's just my belief but from my experience, I will never own a domestic vehicle the rest of my life (unless given to me or won, lol!).  I won't get into my opinion on Buzz or unions, that's for another day......"

Talking to some folks I know who have worked there for  the better part of twenty years... husband and wife who work opposite shifts, their combined income annually is closing in on $200,000.00!!!! Am I missing something? My current job has me working with I.T. professionals, most of which have many years of post secondary education under their belts. They work hard to maintain their skills, either paid by their employer or by them selves. They don't make that kind of money... many not even close!
