27365,cityfisher,2007-01-27 23:45:00,959,"Hey all,  Made my first trip of 07 on cooks. Slept in and made our way on the ice for 9 am.  Packed up all the gear and headed out.... Noticed a couple people driving their cars and LARGE TRUCKS on the ice....   no comment  stayed with one pack of huts for the first half of the day and did wel... Lots of small ones ( we only keep fish over 9') but managed 10 keepers including one MONSTER 14 incher ! ..Biggest perch i have ever seen !  Slowed down in the afternoon so we moved out away from the pack and had some great action!!! 10 more keepers  and we were on our way home.... Had the new Finder with me and never even bother to set it up...lol No need.... perch were everywhere ! !  A couple pics from today     "

27532,cisco,2007-01-28 11:26:00,597,Beauty of a perch! Sounds like you were fishing a bit deeper than the pack.
27586,Smokey,2007-01-28 14:56:00,1278,Nice fish. Congrats.
27637,cityfisher,2007-01-28 16:23:00,959,not too deep... 12-14 feet at both locations
27646,fishindevil,2007-01-28 16:37:00,6254,"wow great report and pics guys..  ..and that perch in your right hand is huge   well if you got a bunch of those you have enough for a HUGE FISH FRY, well i wish i was there   cheers"
27660,Carp,2007-01-28 16:59:00,1488,Nice catch CF.  Cars and trucks already ???
27715,cityfisher,2007-01-28 19:21:00,959, Yeah on the drive back to shore i noticed 4 cars and a couple Large trucks including some guy with a large work truck...
27793,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-28 23:03:00,4399,  Large heavy trucks on the ice now is not wise especially after one went in on Friday but you know ice fishermen are not the sharpest knives in the drawer OFC members excluded of course!  BTW nice perch!
27806,Joey,2007-01-28 23:36:00,9122,WOW!  Jumbo is the word for those perch for sure.  Great stuff.  Joey
27814,Fisherman,2007-01-28 23:53:00,7201,"Nice chunky sized ones, good catch"
