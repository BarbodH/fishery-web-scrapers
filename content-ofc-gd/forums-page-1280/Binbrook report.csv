Hard to locate numbers. 4 to 5 inches of good ice (easy to drill thru) this is the ""okay"" (ya he is little but he is my first of 07)........  and another shot of it  will try again next weekend somewhere else ......"
27866,mason05,2007-01-29 01:14:00,258,Not bad for your first outing man.  Better to catch something little than nothing.  Good to hear the ice is safe.  Corn Nug
27879,firefisher,2007-01-29 01:30:00,22,Hey Grog  Put about 2 hours in at binbrook this afternoon and came home with nothing.  Would have been nice to stay alittle longer but I brought the brother in law with me and he was getting cold.  Should have left him at home....LOL!!!!!  FF
27884,stasbrute,2007-01-29 01:36:00,206,Bah! it wasnt cold at all....some people!......
27887,Carp,2007-01-29 01:45:00,1488,Small fish is better than no fish.  Glad to hear people are getting out and finally doing some ice fishing.  I would have thought there would be more than 4 or 5 inches of ice.  Good luck next trip.
