26647,Fisherman,2007-01-25 23:49:00,7201,"26. Why are hemorrhoids called ""hemorrhoids"" instead of ""assteroids""?  Probably 'cause it has to do with ""hemo"", blood leaking out, otherwise if it was assteroids, well maybe your butt would fall out and then you'd be in a bad situation."

They seat themselves, and engage in animated conversation. The lady sitting behind them ignores their conversation at first, but her attention is galvanized when she hears one of the men say the following:  ""Emma come first. Den I come. Den two asses come together. I come once-a-more. Two asses, they come together again. I come again and pee twice. Den I come one lasta time.""  ""You foul-mouthed swine,"" sputters the lady indignantly. In this country we don't talk about our sex lives in public.""  ""Hey, coola down lady,"" said the man. ""Who talkin abouta sexa?

Johnny was working at the fish plant in Carbonear, Newfoundland when he accidentally cut off all ten of his fingers. He went to the emergency room in St. John's. The doctor looked at Johnny and said, ""Let's have da fingers and I'll see what I can do."" Johnny said, ""I haven't got da fingers."" "" What do you mean, you haven't got da fingers? Lord t'undrin Jesus it's 2006! We's got microsurgery and all kinds of incredible techniques. I could have put dem back on and made you like new! Why didn't you bring da fingers?"" Johnny says .. (Are you ready for this?????)      ""How da f___ was I suppose to pick dem up??"
27247,nautifish,2007-01-27 17:04:00,1416,"LOL ROY.  AND NOW FOR ANOTHER......LOL  A man and a woman were having dinner in a fine restaurant. Their waitress, taking another order at a table a few paces away noticed that the man was slowly sliding down his chair and under the table, with the woman acting unconcerned. The waitress watched as the man slid all the way down his chair and out of sight under the table. Still, the woman dining across from him appeared calm and unruffled, apparently unaware that her dining companion had disappeared. After the waitress finished taking the order, she came over to the table and said to the woman, ""Pardon me, ma'am, but I think your husband just slid under the table.""       The woman calmly looked up at her and replied firmly, ""No, he didn't. He just walked in the door."""
