27454,SlowPoke,2007-01-28 04:18:00,2984,"By 8PM we figured you weren't coming so everybody finished thier non-alchoholic beverages and headed home for a good nights sleep to be fresh for early mass in the morning. Okay, just kidding... The truth is we kept getting hit-on by a group of ravishing young ladies with facial hair fetishes... it was horrible. Riddled with guilt, we chose to call it an early evening and return home to our awaiting spouses. -Brian"

27627,Garyv,2007-01-28 16:05:00,547,"It was great once again to see some old faces and meet some new people.  Conversation was non stop and all seemed to enjoy themselves.  Bad weather held off so everyone could have a safe trip home.  I'm sure that if the weather would not have been so ""iffy""  we would have stayed longer.  It was super to hear that Fish and Chips will have an easier time this year at Silvr'y Moon I.E. more time for fishing!!!!  And by the way those burgers are called "" Brontausaurus  Burgers""  12oz of burger with cheese, grilled and raw onions, pickles, tomato and lettuce fries with gravy.   I had one last time and another yesterday, next G2G I'll have another!"
27737,Fishandchips,2007-01-28 20:11:00,72,"they did look pretty good Gary,and yes with 3 extra days fishing and no travelling to Sudbury it will be more like a vacation,especially for my wife and daughter who had to try and stay busy for 4 hours at the Mall ,good to see you and glad you made it back home ok, Brian"
