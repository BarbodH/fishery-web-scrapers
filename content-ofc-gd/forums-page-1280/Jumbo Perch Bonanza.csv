We went somewhere different and got lucky with lots of perch over 7 inches. We both kept our limits of Jumbos between 7 and 8 inches We now have 100 perch each to clean. .

27444,irishfield,2007-01-28 04:06:00,26272,What..a report with no pretty pictures so we can put a face to the name... and I presume you mean you have a 100 fish to clean between you..not each?  No problem finding bait ?
27504,cityfisher,2007-01-28 05:21:00,959,i kept 20 between 2 people today (over 9 inches today) and  that was More than enough Cleaning for one afternoon
27513,Clampet,2007-01-28 08:52:00,1947, I thought it was fifty per person.
27515,ch312,2007-01-28 08:59:00,1590," thats wut im sayin. obviously hes new to fishing if he thinks anything over 7"" is a jumbo. imho anything over 11 or 12 inches is a jumbo. lets just hope buddy didnt actually keep 100 perch each   teach him bout the regs guys"
27516,nautifish,2007-01-28 09:01:00,1416,So did i clampet.    I was thinking the same thing when he called 6-7 inches Jumbo's....lol...I am guessing this is his 1st post and as you said pretty new to fishing so thought i had best be gentle.
27518,Fish Farmer,2007-01-28 09:04:00,2234,"50 Per Person with regular licence, 25 with conservation licence"

27556,Gerritt,2007-01-28 14:08:00,6129,I say we let him clarify himself before we place the dagger in his back and start twisting.  Gerritt.
27564,Greencoachdog,2007-01-28 14:17:00,8163,"  Well actually a Jumbo is over 12"", and if they were just 7-8"" long... they were prolly stunted and needed a good ""cleaning out"". So you did good Cala!!!"
27569,Rich Clemens,2007-01-28 14:22:00,3131,"I can't imagine cleaning 100 fish ... take me dang near the entire afternoon, but I'll bet they're mighty tasty.    Sounds like a load of fun though."
27585,Terry,2007-01-28 14:49:00,14456,I think this 42 year old squid needs to tell us some more details lol
