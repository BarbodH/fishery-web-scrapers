They end up loseing the stick to push the gondula and are stuck yet again in the middle of a larger and wider river.  Anyway the end up sat in this thing all night freezing the buns off..foggy as hell and cannot see past there noses. ..thinking that the water is really deep. When victor wakes up the next morning they are still in the exact same place and a guy is stood right next to there boat in waders fly fishing...LOL.....  IF YOU SEE THE HONDA SONG CLIP WATCH IT....That was actually a hr long episode of the three of them stuck on the moterway in a traffic jam in the summer on a hot day sat in the car.
