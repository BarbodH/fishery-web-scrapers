27787,FishFinder,2007-01-28 22:54:00,481,"DSN, Do you have the portable or the normal version? http://www.basspro.com/servlet/catalog.Tex...arTarget=browse Thanks for the help, im probably going to go with the 320."
27791,dsn,2007-01-28 23:05:00,1018,  I have the portable one.   I friend of mine has the piranha. I also took a look at the Cuda before I decided on the Eagle Fish Mark 320. The Cuda is good. I like the bright colors and white background. But I wish they made a more horizontal screen instead of vertical. Just my prefference cause you get a wider screen.  dsn
