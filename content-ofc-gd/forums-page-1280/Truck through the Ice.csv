27152,cisco,2007-01-27 03:32:00,597,"He just needed to get a better run at it!  The thicker ice is a ways out so if he coulda just got er a bit further out to reach it he'd a bin a real smart guy, a real hero to all starin at him!   NOT!"
27163,kemper,2007-01-27 04:07:00,2232,one word comes to mind.  moron.

27206,Rich,2007-01-27 12:37:00,3927,Go figure. THat 1/4 ton pickup broke through 4 inches of fringe ice.
27229,bucktail,2007-01-27 15:34:00,1857,Awesome!!!! I guess someone had to be first and break the ice! Pun intended!!
27230,joonmoon,2007-01-27 15:40:00,528,"Well one things for sure.....the Polar Bear Club will be happy now.  Ice......Concrete......I think theres a similarity......hmmmm.......cement.....and head come to mind as well. I wonder about some peoples children. What a bafoon. We should all get together and head up there and when we get there we could all laugh and cheer, clapping our hands and chanting obsenities at the fool. Too bad he didn't get hurt, the dumbdonkey."
27252,Clampet,2007-01-27 17:33:00,1947,Interesting how the license plate was left out of the picture.
27280,walleyejigger,2007-01-27 19:05:00,876,"talk about lucky, i've seen much worse (deeper) where the truck disappears,  maybe it's ford shooting a new commercial ""built ford tough"""
27334,tinbanger,2007-01-27 22:16:00,1028,"well a least they got thier hut on the ice.  Kinda of a related storey from earlier this week when Pikeie and I spent a few hours on the ice.  There was a decomissioned APC (large rubbered tire vehicle , sand color with a 'turret' on top) stuck in the mud were the dirt bikers play about 500yds from the lake at the end of 89. Quite the expensive venture as the first Currie heavy tow truck( type use to haul 18 wheelers) got stuck as well and a second heavy tow was there when we left around 6pm trying to pull out both mired vehicles.  And I thought fishing was expensive."

27023,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-26 22:55:00,4399,"Dumb as brick,i wouldn`t put a hut out on 4.5 inches of ice let alone a heavy 4x4.  All it takes is a phone call or 2 too check conditions."
27026,xrap,2007-01-26 23:00:00,683,  LOL
27028,PatB,2007-01-26 23:12:00,104,"BigChev too funny......  Either to many cocktails before going out or just a little brain dead. I just don't understand people doing this kind of stuff, when all over the net everyone talks about ice conditions... Boggles my mind."
27030,Terry,2007-01-26 23:16:00,14456,yeah everyone knows he should have waited till saturday to drive a truck on the ice.....lol
27033,wuchikubo,2007-01-26 23:24:00,1114,"If they have a pick up, a ice hut, and probably proper fishing gear, you'd think they would drill a hole 50 ft from shore to check the ice thickness to be sure, but NOoooo, drive the truck onto the thin ice and make a fool out of themselves and make it look like ice anglers don't look too smart.  D#%b donkey!  "
27034,booda_11,2007-01-26 23:24:00,5, I think not only is the brain dead someone removed it for Dr. Frankenstien's research.   No Brains
27038,mattyk,2007-01-26 23:26:00,2110,"Well, atleast they are safe, but have some common sesne before going out there."
27039,Clampet,2007-01-26 23:26:00,1947,"I always said: "" When the fools stop breaking through, it will be safe to go out"". At least he was close to shore."
27064,express168,2007-01-27 00:06:00,327, you think guys this smart are capable of using a computer!
27068,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-27 00:10:00,2585,last year i think at the same spot about 10 cars went through while parked on the ice.  maybe we should send the guy the ice safety chart that we have floating around here!  Cheers!
27072,fishforfun,2007-01-27 00:15:00,105, Exactly Terry he probably saved a few the grief but no doubt there will be more that try in the am
27077,irishfield,2007-01-27 00:29:00,26272,"Tomorrow should be interesting....with many thanks to the A-Channel promoting 10"" of ice on the news tonight!"
27081,fishindevil,2007-01-27 00:33:00,6254,well   hes lucky he wasnt alot farther out on the bay   or the outcome might not have been so good....
27083,FinS,2007-01-27 00:34:00,463,lol some people will never learn
