27389,Rob,2007-01-28 01:01:00,467,"Well I went to see the surgeon the other day, had my splint and staples removed and new x-rays of my leg taken. The physiotherapist went through the exercise regime that I will do by myself, it is amazing how tight your muscles and tendons get after 10 days! The surgeon told me no weight bearing for 4 weeks and then some weight bearing after that. I have another appointment with him on March 1st. I will then start physio treatment after that date. I am to wear this new air pillow strut cast for 4 months but I will be able to walk with it after four to five weeks. I have 1 metal plate with 8 screws (4 above the break and 4 below) so far no sign of infection (very good!!!) I am still having some swelling and pain, more so when I do the exercises. The pics below tell it all. I am allowed to remove the cast for bathing, sleeping and exercises. Hope I don't make anyone queezy.  Rob C       "
