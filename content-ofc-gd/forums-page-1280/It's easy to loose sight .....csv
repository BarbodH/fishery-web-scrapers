I took a step back in the year 2006, and simply had FUN!  Here's some pics from 2006 highlighting some bright smiles and great friendships                      Here's to great friendships and tight lines in 2007!  (time for the leafs game)"

27434,tbayboy,2007-01-28 03:51:00,1497,"Wow, gotta agree with everyone else.  Perfectly said, its all about the friendship and good times, even if if the fish don't want to comply:    We still talk about how much fun that trip was."
27451,nautifish,2007-01-28 04:15:00,1416,I agree great post & i absolutley love the pictures.  Fishing has allways and will allways be about smiles and freindship for me. I  have met and made many great freinds just through fishing alone since i returned home to canada in 2001.
