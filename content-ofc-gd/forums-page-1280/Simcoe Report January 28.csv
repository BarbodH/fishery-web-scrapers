27785,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-28 22:51:00,0,"Corey and I finally got out on the ice for the first time in 2007.  Was dying to try our new hut as well as some recently acquired equipment.      It was pretty chilly but not too windy.  The bite wasn't overly strong but we didn't get skunked, a few small fellas who are still swimming but it was sure nice to get out.  There was probably about 8 inches of ice.  Anyways a few pics from the day....  Getting set up...   This one turn out pretty good...a cold morning sky....   The new hut....   I'm really happy with my float suit....   Here's a shot from the toque cam....   Mistyjr.....   Thanks for reading."

27789,dsn,2007-01-28 22:56:00,1018,Glad you made it out. That second shot is amazing with the fisher people in the background and that cloudy sky with the sun breaking through. Looks like a group meeting out there with the gatherings.  dsn

Glad to see some folks are finally able to get out for some hard-water action.   You got all that gear tested out.  The next time, you'll fill that little white bucket."

I forgot to mention, as we were coming off the ice, there was a CO there checking licences.    Told him it was good to see him there.  Had a nice chat with Peter of Ice Cabins as well.  Jim"
