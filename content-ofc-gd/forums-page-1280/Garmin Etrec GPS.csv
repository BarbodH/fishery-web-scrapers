The Etrec appears to suit what I need and I just wanted to hear from those who have one or has had one. Thanks."

But in that price range I would also consider A Magellan GPS unit, they are more accurate 3 to 5 meters (10 - 16 feet) and 14 channels when fog rolls in this would be helpful. The Garmin claims accuracy of 15 meters (49 feet) A considerable difference w/ a max of 12 channels  Just something to consider.  Here is a link for you too look over  http://www.magellangps.com/products/produc...amp;prodID=1268   Gerritt."
