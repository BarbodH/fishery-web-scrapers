27060,Pinch,2007-01-26 23:58:00,231,I just started to read the latest issue of Ontario Out of Doors and the first article that I read was the Letter of the Month by our very own Rick O'Banion.  An excellent letter Rick.
27063,Roy,2007-01-27 00:03:00,13728,Thanks Bud...I don't have a copy yet but I think TJ was going to scan the one he had. He's busy tonight so maybe someone else can do that for us.
27066,PatB,2007-01-27 00:08:00,104,"On my out to see if I can get a copy. This is one power full site, seems everyone is getting famous."

27104,Loonietoon,2007-01-27 01:27:00,1450,
27106,bigfish1965,2007-01-27 01:31:00,3382,Thanks guys. The original letter contained a link to the poacher thread we had here. That thread certainly generated alot of attention across the province and we could tell by the number of hits going in from government web servers. Let's hope someone is listening.
27116,troutologist,2007-01-27 01:55:00,951,Great job by Rick and OOD. With more and more publicity these problems will come to a head sooner than later.
27136,Bernie,2007-01-27 02:44:00,3190,Way to go Rick   Letters are still one of the best ways to get a response. More of us should write letters when we feel things are not right.
27146,Bly,2007-01-27 03:11:00,1556,Well done Rick  bly
27172,Whopper,2007-01-27 04:49:00,2174,Well done Rick!
27204,pigeonfisher,2007-01-27 12:28:00,696,Nicely put Rick
27221,OhioFisherman,2007-01-27 14:52:00,6623,"Nice job Rick, nothing gets done if nobody knows, and letters are harder to ignore than phone calls."
27238,Chris,2007-01-27 16:28:00,405,
27618,TJQ,2007-01-28 15:51:00,7806,I finally got to it.. ya good job rick.
27665,setomonkey,2007-01-28 17:21:00,872,"Nice letter, Rick, good way to publicize the issue...  wtg!  Mike"
27693,Carp,2007-01-28 18:36:00,1488,Excellent work Richard.  I'll bet those two guys from Lake St. Clair don't try that stunt again.
27836,cisco,2007-01-29 00:28:00,597,"Good article to reflect the feelings of the average angler in Ontario! Next time I hope all the folks with cameras spend the time to take pics of stuff MNR can use to aprehend the poachers. Shots of vehicle licence plate and boat registration along with clearer shots of the illegal lines they were said to be using and their faces. Otherwise it's a waste of scarce enforcement dollars. We have to self-police. I have my camera with me now on all trips afield and will take the needed time away from my joy of fishing or hunting to get the evidence.  To be clear, we must get photos of stuff that help MNR to easily track down the accused and gain a conviction/plea bargain on. Vehicle ID gets MNR to the door where the guys say it wasn't them or their lines were legit. But photos of their mugs and of the extra lines gives MNR the edge they need.  Please donate the extra time needed to gather this vital evidence, or else don't get upset if MNR can't do anything.  I bet considerable MNR resources went into that particular investigation......... just because a few close well-thought-out shots hadn't been taken by all the folks with cameras there who didn't know any better.  It's up to all of us folks!!!!!  Let's use our cameras better!"
