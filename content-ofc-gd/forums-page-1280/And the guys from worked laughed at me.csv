Chatham-Kent Police say the man attempted to walk across the Sydenham River last night. Apparently, he was 25-feet from reaching shore, when he fell through the ice, near James Street. The man was already out of the water when police arrived, and didn't require any medical attention. Police did say there was a bridge nearby.   I juess he should have taken a few more steps and used the bridge."
