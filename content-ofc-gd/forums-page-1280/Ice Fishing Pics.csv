27846,jediangler,2007-01-29 00:44:00,1923,"Too bad about your luck guys, and Happy B-Day Rich. I think all of you ice fishermen, yes even my brother Joonmoon, are nutcases. But if I was to go out on the ice with anyone it would be nutcases like Sleded, BBR & Joonmoon. The only thing that gets my goat is the apparent lack of breakdancing on ice pics."
27880,joonmoon,2007-01-29 01:30:00,528,Yes well said Nautifish.  And a happy B-Day to Rich.  21 Eh!  Hey Bro ya gotta try it with us some day it's a blast with some good guys and humour to keep you warm. Some times after fishin with the boyz I have had a sore gut from all the laughing and horsin around.  Where would the net be without all the joy these guys bring us. Hey Sleded sorry to bring it up again but gotta do it.  Now where's that link.....? Ah here it is.  http://www.zippyvideos.com/6094975132939106/dec30th1/
27886,joonmoon,2007-01-29 01:40:00,528,For those who may have missed it.  http://www.zippyvideos.com/6094975132939106/dec30th1/
27891,nautifish,2007-01-29 01:50:00,1416,LOL JOON THAT VIDEO IS PRETTY FUNNY....   IT just really niffs me when people get upset over something that really is not so much of a big deal..........Today i found out a very dear fishing freind of mine had a heart attack and is in the hospital.....Great guy with a vantastic wife...........Its sad and i am praying for them both.....So when you hear of news like this and then see some people get all irrate over some peanut shells  some young lads goofing around because its a special birthday 21 that is.....out on the ice   well i am gonna say no more....Takes alot to pish me off and right now i am pretty ticked OFF.
27895,joonmoon,2007-01-29 02:05:00,528,"Thats  a shame about your friend hope all is well. Ya know some people will always be stooges and try to bring others to there level, but you be bigger and let them look foolish, you be the bigger person so to speak. Thats all...look where its comin from...Once I have said my peace and did my rant I feel better besides they don't know the guys and we do. All is well and let fools be fools, they will never be anything more than fools."
27905,snag,2007-01-29 02:14:00,1932,"I have to take issue.  Once again your behaviour is appalling.  Animals are attracted to refuse.  If an elephant walked out onto 4-5"" of ice to eat your garbage,  What do you think would happen?  I'm calling the cops this time.  Your  ""Donesville""  buddy.  S."
27918,nautifish,2007-01-29 02:36:00,1416,"If an elephant walked out onto 4-5"" of ice to eat your garbage,  What do you think would happen?    I reckon the boys would have been taking a swim with the elephant......lol"
27953,Rich,2007-01-29 04:06:00,3927,The ice held us up.. no elephant could compare!
27967,snag,2007-01-29 04:48:00,1932,   Touche'
27976,camillj,2007-01-29 05:07:00,1988,Wow .. we are too tightly wound ... obvoiusly not enough ice time yet  I saw the pic... and actually I was trying to figure it out (peanut shells makes sense now) .. but I actually thought ... hey what a clever idea .. take some wood shavings out there to get better traction inside the hut (it normally gets pretty slippery in mine after a hard weekend of jiggin) .. and more than once I've twisted a knee sliding for a hookset ... I actually already have some woodchips to take with me for the next trip
27495,Rich,2007-01-28 05:14:00,3927,We found about 4-5 inches of ice in all the spots we tried today.. unfortunately not a fish in sight. IT was fun getting out and giving the hut its first test run.          
27543,Clampet,2007-01-28 13:10:00,1947,I think I see the problem. Can anyone else?
27545,snoil,2007-01-28 13:23:00,139,I can.It's usually a hot topic.
27548,joefish,2007-01-28 13:35:00,165,Outfits dont match? Right?????? Bad....Very bad!!!
27558,SMITH01,2007-01-28 14:09:00,3,I HOPED THEY CLEANED UP THEIR BLOODY MESS BR FORE THEY LEFT
27561,Clampet,2007-01-28 14:12:00,1947,"If I know BBR, he took that Pic on purpose just ta rile tha community...didn't ya, didn't ya."
27562,Rich,2007-01-28 14:12:00,3927,"Always do clean up our mess Smith.  And no Clampet, if I wanted to rile the community I would have posted the FULL report,  This is the censored, safe version."
27565,Clampet,2007-01-28 14:17:00,1947,"Eee doogies, youn feller, you mean there's more. Do share.  I need some ener tain ment"
27566,Rich Clemens,2007-01-28 14:19:00,3131,I see it ... a few containers of ANTIFREEZE lyin there.
27572,Clampet,2007-01-28 14:24:00,1947,"Your getting close. Now can anyone see why these three outgoing anglers have failed to pull one measly little perchy perch from that big ole Lake Simcoe.  Look again, it is kinda obvious."
27574,Rich,2007-01-28 14:25:00,3927,Probably cuz we werent fishing Lake Simcoe or anywhere near it.. just my guess.
27575,aniceguy,2007-01-28 14:26:00,1094,
27580,Rich,2007-01-28 14:29:00,3927,*Sigh* .. internet forums.
27582,mattyk,2007-01-28 14:35:00,2110,sorry dude about no fish. At least you guys were outside!
27635,joonmoon,2007-01-28 16:20:00,528,"Hey Rich, glad to see you were out and have decent ice there on lake X. I know you guys had fun and as far as a mess? I have fished with these fine young gentlemen in the past several times and when they leave so does all the garbage, so those of you who are bored and don't have anything to do but jump all over everyone while you sit on your butt at a computer....well you know where to ...  . And besides what mess are you refering to I don't see any??? Hey Sleded what were you guys using for bait? And what portable hut did yas get?  As far as the shoreline thats a natural shoreline and the branches lying around fall from the trees and ......well nevermind if you ever left your computer desk maybe you would know what nature looks like. I'm sorry if I sound irritated but I have had enough of the armchair bosses on here. Thats not what this board is for. GET A GRIP>"
27657,ch312,2007-01-28 16:53:00,1590,"lol i shoulda swung by with a few wobbly pops when i was done hunting....  when your facing the lake from the road, do you guys go more towards the left or the right? ive always seen people go towards the beach but ive never been over that way..."
27663,xrap,2007-01-28 17:17:00,683,Sucks about the no fish but atleast you had fun. Love reading your posts Rich there full of excitement and laughter WTG! Keep on posting don't listen to the jerks that only rag on people and don't have anything nice to say.
27667,Carp,2007-01-28 17:24:00,1488,"At least you got out, even if the fish weren't co-operating. You brought the BBQ too. Nice move. Just because the fish aren't biting, doesn't mean the anglers have to go hungry.  I guesss the pic(s) causing the stir have already been removed."
27727,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-28 19:48:00,2585,yeah i ddint see any pics that looked bad to me.  Well thanks for your report to bad you guys didnt get any fish but nice to be out anyway im sure!  THanks for the report!  Cheers!
27775,Canuck2fan,2007-01-28 22:27:00,1444,"Rich another great report sorry about you not folks not getting fish, but it looks like you had fun anyhow. BTW I was out steelheading and did get a 2"" sunfish today... which was kind of a let down LOL"
27794,nautifish,2007-01-28 23:09:00,1416,  amen joon  Blimey people really need to lighten up...Like there has never been  icefishing pictures posted on the net of guys out on the ice eating and drinking and there rubbish on the ice where they are fishing.....They took it with them  did not leave it they're......Never have i seen these boy's leave a mess anywhere they have fished.......with me....So give it a bloody rest.......Sad Sad little people........  You have nothing postive to say then keepo it to ur damn self or in private IE.....pm!  Yeah i am pished......Sick of seeing this crap on internet forums of late.
27800,Joey,2007-01-28 23:26:00,9122," I saw the pic, and see both sides here.  I think the real question is, what was the purpose of taking or posting that pic?  Just an observation.... not jumping on anyone or starting anything  Joey"
27802,Rich,2007-01-28 23:31:00,3927,"The purpose of the pic was to show all of the peanut shells all over the ""floor"" we had been munching on all day.. on my forum that is kind of our 'inside joke' cuz we always have a bag of peanuts for good luck.  I think we need to find a different good luck charm though ... we've used up all the lucky peanuts."
27803,Joey,2007-01-28 23:33:00,9122," Ahhhh, okay, I get it, thanks Rich.  Joey"
27809,nautifish,2007-01-28 23:40:00,1416,"I saw the pictures also Joey.  It was some pictures of some young lads out fishing having a good time on riches 21st birthday which is today...My gawd peanet shells........To get upset over some peanut shells.........Maybe next time they should take some table & chairs on the ice and some dinner plateswith knives and forks just to keep some people happy.  They cleaned it all up.......As i said they allways have when they have been out with me or anyone esle from what i hear.    Joey i know ur not jumping on anyone hun......Not sure what has happened on these boards of late what with people talking and starting crap of late...Maybe its cabin fever, Maybe these people should get of there asses and get outside who knows.....I just know that i have seen far worse on the net when it comes to what did someone say?  Slobs on the ice?  Puurrleasseeee!!!  Joey"
