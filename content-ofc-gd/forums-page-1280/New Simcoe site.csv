27736,dsn,2007-01-28 20:11:00,1018,  Thats an old map of the ice conditions.   There's no way the ice out at JPcan be 26 inches at this time. Last year it was late feb. and this year with the slow freeze up doesn't make sense.  But I'll call up and find out just incase!! I want out!!  dsn
27754,SlowPoke,2007-01-28 21:06:00,2984,I think its meant to read 2-6 inches
27796,dsn,2007-01-28 23:12:00,1018, ahhh bummer I'm dyin to get out that way for some lakers and white fish!!  dsn
