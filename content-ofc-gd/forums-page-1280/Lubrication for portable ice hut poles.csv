26819,Fishnfiend,2007-01-26 14:32:00,357,I have a clam and often is difficult to extend/compress the poles.  What type of lubricant shoud I put on the poles that will not be affected by extreme cold or a little moisture (when I run my heater)? I have had to resort to a BFH to compress them before...
26823,Terry,2007-01-26 14:41:00,14456,"I have the same problem and have be thinking about what can be used you don't want something that will stay wet like oil, or dirty like graphite or  wd40  that could gum it up over time..I have been thinking that a wax product might be the way to go..but I will be interested to see what people think"
26824,bigfish1965,2007-01-26 14:44:00,3382,The only liquid that might not freeze up that I can think of would be the -50 windshield fluid that has RainX in it. Just has teflon in it I think.

26834,Terry,2007-01-26 15:03:00,14456,"well...... this is what clam corp. has to say  Problem: The Pole Glide Technology is not moving smoothly. Possible cause: Although the poles are pre-lubricated at the factory, the lubrication can dry/evaporate prior to use.  Solution:  To maximize our Pole Glide Technology, we recommend spraying a small amount of WD-40Â® (or similar lubricant) into the openings (ends) of the Hoop Poles before assembling the shelter.  Next, turn the Hoop Pole over to let the excess lubricant drain off (stuffing paper towels into the ends of the tube before turning it over will help prevent the lubricant from dripping out onto the floor).  Finally, you may also want to lubricate the Seat Rail Tubes for easier back and forth seat movement."

27350,fishindevil,2007-01-27 23:16:00,6254,"hey guys what about dry graphite spray from a can...i use that stuff for everything,door hinges,trailer hitch etc....it doesnt run it sticks like glue,i think it should work on those poles i just read the can and it says to use on just about anything ...and its very waterproof...i got my can at canadian tire    hope this helps guys let me know what you think????"

27481,Sinker,2007-01-28 04:53:00,8692,I use WD-40 as well......just a shot here and there every once in a while. Makes a big difference too. I hate fooling with those stupid poles.......  Sinker
27492,charlied,2007-01-28 05:08:00,584,well if you have nothing do what I do with my fishing rods...run it thru your hair...those oils will not freeze....LOL.  And if your worried about dirt don't worry if your like me you shower as soon as you get home anyways!
27642,joonmoon,2007-01-28 16:30:00,528,If anyone has a baby you can try using just a little petroleum jelly around the sticky spots. Just a dab will do ya. Works for me and my grandson doesn't mind sharing a little jelly too.
