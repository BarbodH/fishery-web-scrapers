Any retailers in the GTA area selling them (coudnt see it on LBs site).  Maybe useful to me trying to find mid-lake structure and steep drop-offs etc. (forgot to mark waypoints last time out in the boat) without punching alot of holes."
27755,ChrisK,2007-01-28 21:10:00,2772,"Turtle, Looks like a real handy item to have in the boat and on the ice....  Heres the link http://www.strikemaster.com/polarvision.html"
27857,Greencoachdog,2007-01-29 01:03:00,8163,"I actually have one of these and have used it, it's ok and shoots thru the ice as advertised... but you have to clear all the snow off the spot you're gonna shoot and pour a little water on it before the unit will function properly.  I also used it in the rental boat at the Lakair G2G last year, stood it up in the rear of the boat next to the transom that had a little water standing and it shot thru the wooden hull and read the depths ok.  For the money (I paid $99 USD for mine) I would suggest getting a portable fishfinder like this one:  http://www.basspro.com/servlet/catalog.Tex...arTarget=browse  or this one:  http://www.basspro.com/servlet/catalog.Tex...arTarget=browse  I hope this helps!"
27996,turtle,2007-01-29 11:35:00,274,"Thanks for the replies, on the Cabelas site there was pretty much the same opinion-you have to drill a hole or get some water on the ice to make it work properly.  Sounds like it doesnt go through any ice surface as advertised (without qualification).  I have a couple of portable fishfinders that do the same thing (one less gadget is OK)."
