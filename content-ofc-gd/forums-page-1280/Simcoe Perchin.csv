27344,FishFinder,2007-01-27 23:01:00,481,"Went out ice fishing today with Uncle Buck. we got into quite a few fish thanks to his equipment..  Lots of people, but im used to worse on the rivers  We caught atleate 100 fish each, though i didnt really keep count.. Lots of small ones but heres the keepers.  Some close ups   And the biggest of the day   All my fish were caught on a small jig and a berkley power bait minnow. I used a float because i was no good at feeling the light strikes. Only problem is it was a fixed float, boy did people think i was crazy when i started running away from my hole everytime i hooked up. lol  Uncle Buck used minnows and a Jig and both seemed to produce equally well."
27356,Mike Pike,2007-01-27 23:26:00,1332,"Well, I'd say you did pretty good today, especially for your first time!  Guess it helps hooking up with a pro like Goran though, eh?  Congratz on the perch and you'll enjoy ice fishing even more once you fry yourself up some of that perch.  Thanks for that post."
