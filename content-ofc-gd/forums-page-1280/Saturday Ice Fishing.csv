Jeff caught 2 nice splake about 16"" and my buddy caught another, on spoons tipped with minnows. Personally I have a new white stripe on the back of my floater suit. Lots of hits throughout the day, last few trips out seems that noon is the active time. Despite the snow it was a great day to be out.  "

27960,Carp,2007-01-29 04:26:00,1488,Very nice colours on that fish. Looks more like a brookie than a splake.  Thanks for the report.
