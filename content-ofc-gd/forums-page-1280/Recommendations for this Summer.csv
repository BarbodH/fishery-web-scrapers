We are not fishing experts by any stretch , so we do not know where the best places to go are. We would like to catch Bass, and Walleye . Any suggestions within 4 hours of Sault Ste Marie? Thanks,"
26264,Bernie,2007-01-25 01:28:00,3190,Welcome on plkazoo.   Maybe you could try out TJ's new site. He's doing a beta test on it here. www.ontariooutfittersnetwork.com/

26408,Zib,2007-01-25 14:18:00,369,I went to Pine Portage Lodge (Kaby Lake) back in Aug. 2004. We caught a lot of walleye & pike. Even my father-in-law caught a lot & he's not a fisherman. Not many trophy fish (though they are there) but you will catch a lot. They don't have any bass but do have whitefish & perch. The food at the lodge is great & the people very friendly. Our group ran the lodge out of beer in less than 3 days.  Here's their link: http://www.fishthefinest.com/
