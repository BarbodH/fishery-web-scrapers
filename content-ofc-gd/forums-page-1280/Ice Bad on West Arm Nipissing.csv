27661,capt_hooked,2007-01-28 17:11:00,212,"I just did a tour, out in front and found only 4-5 inches of ice and lots of bad slush!  So it's not good... be careful if you are traveling this end of the lake.  There are some huts out already... but I would not advise putting out huts.... there just isn't enough ice, at least not in this particular area.  I understand there may be more ice over Calander Bay area?.... but only rumours I have heard...   stay safe............  the capt."
27691,FishFinder,2007-01-28 18:30:00,481,"trying to keep all the ice to yourself eh? lol jks, more people would probably notice this if you posted this in the main section"
27695,fishindevil,2007-01-28 18:43:00,6254,hey capt. thanks for the ice update for the awsome lake called the big nip...
27697,Carp,2007-01-28 18:49:00,1488,"With the recent cold temps, I thought there would be more ice than that. Could the currents be hindering the ice making proces.  ....and people are driving cars and trucks on L. Simcoe.  I don't get it.   Thanks for the update Capt. Hooked."
27698,irishfield,2007-01-28 18:51:00,26272,Thanks for coming out of hibernation Bud! Exactly what I told your son to tell the callers...so they leave their garbage at the other end of the lake..LOL

27724,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-28 19:43:00,2585,i heard that there is 10-12 inches on the east end of nipissing but people are warned to still be cautious out there.  THanks for the heads up about the west arm.  Cheers!
