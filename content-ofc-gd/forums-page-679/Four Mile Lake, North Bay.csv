469326,bow slayer,2010-05-25 02:46:00,1074," try the hydro pond in Powassan,lots of pike and walleye."

469721,bow slayer,2010-05-26 01:56:00,1074, It is a man made reservoir on the south river just outside powassan. It has a day use beach area. The lake itself has alot of flooded timber. Just ask at the Bait/tackle store in Powassan(the name escapes me right now) they will point you in the right direction.
469736,Nipfisher,2010-05-26 03:01:00,2449,Four mile lake has lots of little pike in it. Nothing too big but you can find the odd 3-4 pounders. I think maybe some smallmouth too. Also lots of rock bass.
469742,cram,2010-05-26 03:21:00,1733," Tackle store is Brushy's.  Pond is on the south side of 534, just west of hwy 11.  At least i think that's what bowslayer's referring to."
