470276,I'mHooked,2010-05-27 19:44:00,525,Good to meet you and Brook today.  Thanks for the help.   I really didn't think it was as quick & easy as you showed it to be.  I'm Hooked
470291,TC1OZ,2010-05-27 20:21:00,987,Heroin is pretty easy to get hooked on....  But seriously what did they help you out with? lol
470298,Joey,2010-05-27 20:42:00,9122,"Ya, thanks Spiel, whatever you did"
470316,Roy,2010-05-27 21:00:00,13728,I suspect that Spiel helped save the life of a troubled rod. I don't think Brook helped though....she hasn't started building rods yet has she?
470319,Spiel,2010-05-27 21:02:00,9065,"LOL, yep just a quick tip guide replacement for I'mHooked. Nice to have met you to Craig and thanks for the baits, I hope to put them to good use soon."
470325,aplumma,2010-05-27 21:16:00,6896,  Spiel builds rods???? I thought that Brook was the person and Spiel was the dog??? I will need to see which one of them has thumbs to believe that one Roy.   Art
470362,I'mHooked,2010-05-27 23:08:00,525," Well I can tell you which one was definitely the better looking one  Yes, the life of a troubled rod was saved. A rod so troubled in fact that it's tip was broken by an overzealous father-in-law who was checkng the action on a BRAND NEW rod that hasn't even had a reel on it yet!"
