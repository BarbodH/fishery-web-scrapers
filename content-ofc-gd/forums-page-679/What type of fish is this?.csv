469293,splashhopper,2010-05-25 02:03:00,2931,  I caught this yesterday and am stumped as to what it is.  It has the spots of a brown but could also be a speckled or a rainbow?  It was caught on the Sydenham river if that helps.
469295,Dutchy,2010-05-25 02:05:00,416,its a rainbow
469296,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-25 02:06:00,10439,Rainbow parr.
469320,NANUK,2010-05-25 02:37:00,797,That is a rainbow trout. Juveniles have those big spots around lateral line.
469381,BillM,2010-05-25 12:25:00,17367,"Yup, rainbow smolt.  If you are catching lots of them, you should probably move.  Those are future steelhead"
469713,splashhopper,2010-05-26 01:21:00,2931," Yep, I moved...."
