469751,oates,2010-05-26 04:34:00,151,"I have been fishing now for about 2.5 years, I have yet to bump in to a CO. I generally fish rivers so maybe that's why. I don't know how the COs could patrol all Ontatio waters, there is more water in Ontario than landmass in most countries. That being said, it isn't working. Not only do some people have no respect for the rules (which are obviously designed to help fish and fisherman alike) I see people throwing fish in the water (10ft way) or throwing them at their buddies whilst they also toss ciggarettes and crap in the river. I feel to get robocop on them but what am I gonna do, punch them out and get charged for assualt? Usually you get a dumb response to boot, no remorse.  From reading other posts in this thread, it would seem the only solution would be to fund the CO program more or incorporate the CO with the local police even on a minor level. To be honest, it doesn't seem to be the avid fisherman who is the problem, seems more like Joe Blow who fishes strictly when it is 25c or higher from May 24 to Aug 30.  Without funding, I don't see what can be done. Stiff fines doesn't scare people if they think the odds of getting caught are 10000 to 1."
469867,fishindevil,2010-05-26 15:17:00,6254,"well maybe all these idiots that are fishing for oos bass should see what happens to a basses eggs in the nest when a bass is pulled off,specially if the gobies are around they can clean out a nest in a few seconds....morons...they are on the nest for a reason...i have seen perch and rock bass all around bass that are on their nest just waiting to get in there..."
469890,wask,2010-05-26 16:23:00,174,   This is true... does the same apply if the spawn is over?  Does fishing for OOS become OK if it is done?  Does it then become excusable or permissible?  Just playing devil's advocate...
469892,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-26 16:30:00,3761," By that time the eggs are hatched and the bass will leave the nest as the fry will grow rapidly there fore fend for their selves...Perhaps with a cold spring/cool summer the bass would spawn later and then, no it would not seem ok but who knows. Fish are fish, we dont not target perch simply because they are food for bigger bass, pike, musky, walleye whatever. So are fry and baby fish.  It is right to fish when the season opens because usually(not always) the eggs are hatched."
469955,Billy Bob,2010-05-26 19:20:00,5865," I didn't fail to mention the funding NYS puts towards it's fishery when it comes to bass because it does not exist......to the best of my knowledge NYS does not stock any bass in the WNY area and I doubt they do anywhere in NYS...we have too many bass because no one here, especially in WNY keeps any bass...why would we...they are like eating slimy dirt compared to perch, walleye, crappie and other pan fish.  I didn't realize how many marine biologist we have on board here...  If catch and release is so bad on bass during the spawn why are we allowed to fish bluegills and crappies during the spawn not to mention perch  Bob"

Not really proud of it but it does happen once in a while. With regards to this quoate; ""they also toss ciggarettes and crap in the river""  I think that is just gross, and unhealthy.  Did they have gloves on when they threw the crap or do they do it barehanded.  Either way, peple should never throw crap.  Well almost never.

470137,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-27 13:38:00,932," So let me get this straight . . . your argument of why the American, specifically NYS, bass fishery is better than our Ontario bass fishery is because Americans have a more advanced pallet and simply don't keep any Bass because of their less favourable taste, while us Canadians are eating every Bass we can find.  I for one have never gone down to a Sobey's and seen Cajun Largemouth or Lemon Pepper Smallie.  In fact, in all my years of fishing, I have never even kept a bass.  I must be an anomaly among all these other Canadians who basically just pull the bass from our lakes and throw them down their throats"

NYS does not stock bass as you have implied or did Y O U - F O R G E T.

I personally would love to see more bass sanctuaries like on long point bay the bay gets absolutely raped bass opener and still has a amazing bass fishery there is always going to be poachers no matter what we do some people just won't follow the rules all we can do as responsible anglers is not fall into there ways and lead by example and educate as many fairweather fishermen as you can when ever you can"

I told him that I had only caught 1 walleye and a few panfish (jumbo perch etc).. and he was quick to reply no bass? I told him I had only caught 1 wich I did but I was not targeting bass as they are not in season.. he just laughed and said.. ""ya..."" I told him that its ilegal to fish OOS fish and you can be fined etc.. he just laughed and peeled off.. I was fishing alone and dont have a cell phone or else i would of reported him.. I continued fishing and about half hour later some guys in a seadoo boat pull up and they ask the same.. ""any luck?"" I told him the same.. 1 walleye.. few jumbos.. and like 2 crappie.. put all the fish back.. and they blew up.. they told me that I must be targeting walleye because i was 80 yards away from a patch of lillys and that i was fishing weedlines etc with ""Jigs"" .. I tried to explain that you dont have to troll to catch a walleye.. and that these methods have produced me fish in the past many times.. they went on how I was full of it. etc..

Also, it's a well known fact that the MNR only covers a fraction of the waterways that need to be reinforced, due to being severely underfunded.  At least, for me, I take solitude in the fact that these non-fisherpeople (because many are girls too!) are probably failing to catch anything because they are noobs.  That being said all you can do it make the call to report it, even it you know damn well no CO will ride in on a white horse to uphold the conservation laws.  Vigilante justice isn't the solution.  The family I stayed with this weekend didn't fish, but they also had a ""whats the big deal?"" attitude about OOS fishing.  Whenever I hear this I just teach the other party specifically why they are out of season (beyond the simplistic ""they're mating"" explanation)"

469507,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-25 17:03:00,932, Education in plain English is a great way to let people know why OOS fishing is wrong.  Explain it clear and concise so they remember it when they're talking to others in the future.
469513,Billy Bob,2010-05-25 17:15:00,5865, I see no problem with fishing for bass out of season...here in NYS it's legal and we have some of the best bass fishing in the world......many other southern states don't even have a season on bass...IMHO you guys are all over re-acting over this.  Bob
469518,spyder3g,2010-05-25 17:24:00,50," I don't target any specific kind of fish. Sometimes I take a fishing rod and come to the pond, take a worm and put it in the water and look at the floater. How can I determine that bass or trout or pike is taking my worm (usually sunfish)? Can you explain that?"
469519,Slimeball,2010-05-25 17:24:00,30,"It's unfortunate that some(poachers) knowingly target OOS species. Also unfortunate is the many anglers(many of them from the U.S. sadly) who dont take a few moments to read and understand the regs. The chain of thought seems to be that they can legally fish for out of season species ""as long as they release them"". Educating these people is key. I have even posted a regs section on the website of the lodge i stay at. Still amazes me that when an individual asks for tips on their upcoming trip and i ask them what species they will be targeting, the answer almost always includes a species that the season is closed for the time frame of their trip. From the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources: Fishing season opening and closing dates vary depending on the species and the area. It is illegal to attempt to catch fish for which the season is closed, even if you are going to release them. Fish accidentally caught during the closed season must be immediately released back into the water. Closed seasons protect fish at vulnerable times of the year, especially when they are spawning or protecting their young."
469524,BillM,2010-05-25 17:38:00,17367," Well perhaps you should start targeting fish that are in season.  If you are fishing for whatever (let's say sunfish, crappies and bluegill for example) and are repeatedly hooking into bass, one would think you'd pick up and move.  I don't think playing stupid will get you very far with the CO, although please give it a shot and let us know how big the fine is."
469533,Dutchy,2010-05-25 17:59:00,416," Yeah, good luck with that. Ignorance is no excuse. If you are catching bass OOS, move to another spot or use a different bait. I'd love to be there when you try to use your above rationale with a CO.  I nearly got fined by a CO for something far more minor than catching OOS fish. They don't care about what your intentions are or your Bull excuses."
469536,solopaddler,2010-05-25 18:00:00,8605, Floater?
469537,bucktail,2010-05-25 18:01:00,1857,I think its time they looked at changing the regs on bass. I read a study that stated almost all lakes in Ontario are near or at the carring capacity for bass. This problem happens every year but with limited CO's there is no way they can enforce it. Maybe all C&R from May 15th till openor. I dont think there is any fixes to this problem the way it is now.
469562,hirk,2010-05-25 18:42:00,571,"I think the known biology of LM/SM in terms of survival/recruitment related to spawning does support a early catch and release season in Ontario that would not have a negative impact on populations and I would like to see it atleast on a trial basis for a period of time that would allow for statistical anaylsis to validate it's acceptability.However the current laws as such clearly state it is illegal to target oos bass and it infuriates me when I see ass clowns that KNOW BETTER doing it just because they think they can get away with it.It's not ok to fish without a lic. because that's the law,why do these clowns think it's ok too break that law,I'd love to see CO's start dropping charges on em,pay up or let em tell the judge they were not targeting bass.Word gets around people are being charged and the jokers may find new respect for our laws.It takes a real sportsman with moral fibre to go in and pound LM/SM this time of yr.."
469586,ctranter,2010-05-25 19:19:00,543,"  100% agree.  Also, how do you account for newbies who put in some basic effort into regulations and seasons, but receive confusing information through the reg sheet.  Of course the typical banter is ""they are straight forward"", which is true, but more so after a lifetime of being familiar with them.  When I started fishing I became frustrated with the language and terminology used by the official documents.  How hard would it be for the ministry to make a user friendly site as the first search return on google, that gave generalized information to those typically unfamiliar with reading regs, or at the very least brought people up to speed with the process of following the regulations charts?  Just my 2¢"
469592,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-25 19:32:00,932," This would be a disaster in Ontario.  I agree that NYS has some of the best Bass fishing, but what you fail to mention is the amount of funding that NYS puts towards its fisheries.  We do not have that here in Ontario.  I think you would also be rather alarmed if you saw the differences in COs from NYS to Ontario.  The way the MNR has done it here is that they've made the rules to pre-emptively enforce the issue as opposed to funding enough COs to catch poachers and people who abuse the rules.  I also think it is kind of a joke to allow people to ""live release"" bass year round.  The fish get pulled off their spawning beds and their nests are easily disrupted.  Fish die to improper hooksets and mishandling.  Their eggs get eaten. Keep in mind, this is only for the people that are actually following the ""live release"" part of the rule (which would probably hover around 60-75%).  The main reason that the fisheries in the US are open year round is the amount of revenue it produces.  It is a simple case of putting the dollar first and the health of the fishery second.  What we have seen though is more money going back into the fishery in the US though (probably from more use of the fishery and the need to sustain it).  I'd be very interested to see a report on the health of these American fisheries vs the health of the same fisheries 5, 10, 20 years ago.  Regardless, if you give all the idiots free reign to fish for Bass whenever they want in Ontario, you'd be finding that the waters don't have bass for too long . . . even with the live release rule.  The fact is there just isn't enough funding to maintain the fishery after allowing all that pressure.  The money, followed by an improved fishery, needs to come FIRST.  It can't possibly come second."
469616,peterc,2010-05-25 20:35:00,28,"Please somebody educate me . Yesterday  I've been pitching a swimming jig  with a wire leader . I've caught 3 hammerhandles on this presentation but I also caught a shiphead ,a gar pike and 9 largemouth under 3 lb.Is it ilegal what I'm doing or some of you just like the politics of fishing?  Peter  "
469621,Dutchy,2010-05-25 20:55:00,416," The point would be that if you are in an area with lots of bass you should move. While you may not be specifically targeting them, if you are catching lots of them you should move location. Taking them off the nest is bad as it puts the eggs and fry in severe danger of being eaten. Bass will aggressively hit anything goes past their nest. They don't know there is a hook in it, so we have to exercise some caution on their behalf if we want to keep the fishery going. Its not politics, its common sense. They are OOS for a reason."
469636,timmeh,2010-05-25 21:45:00,609,"While our fishery may in fact be capable of supporting a year round C&R bass season there is 1 major reason I am strongly against it.  Bass are found in nearly every waterbody and caught by a variety of methods. So by opening bass year round you are saying you can fish any system anytime of year. So what would be stopping me from going to the upper saugeen, maity, or any steelhead trib and throwing on a mepps spinner or floating worms in march or april, for bass or course. And if a big run of steelies happen to be coming through and I start picking them off no problem right? As long as I release them.  Or maybe I'll go to my favorite walleye lake in april and bounce jigs for bass. And if I get a bunch of spawning walleye no biggie, I'll just let them go.  Our bass populations are in good shape and MAY be able to withstand the accidental pressure of catching a few during their spawning season while fishing for other species. But are the populations of other key game fish, like trout and walleye, capable of supporting the same pressure if they're caught by ""bass anglers"" during their spawn?"
469640,hirk,2010-05-25 21:58:00,571,I never suggested it should be a yr. round fishery.I think a c/r season from perhaps the 3rd wk in May until the current opening might work.I agree with the issue of tying it into other seasons.By late May in a typical yr. a high percentage of fish would have finished the spawn cycle and be off the beds and it has been proven in studies that nest recruitment from sucessful nests can offset the void of nest failure due to the balance of food/competion.
469641,Cudz,2010-05-25 22:00:00,2652,I spent a few minutes today looking at a floater. I had totally forgot that we ate corn last night.  Seems that I don't even chew my corn.

It was nice to see but honestly it happens. There are to many ignorant people targeting bass with plastics and other means.

If a bass is there it will probably strike, if I see it following or close to the area im targeting then i dont cast to it...simple.  Bass are bass and there are so many in our lakes these days.

I blatently called out two guys who were top water bassing.  They told me they could do whatever they wanted and I should mind my own business.  I bit my tongue and wished them well and hoped they got caught and fined.
469372,fish_fishburn,2010-05-25 11:53:00,1311,"As soon as you pull a bass of their nest the rock bass and other small panfish move in and chow down on the eggs. They can emty a nest in the amount of time that you hook, catch and release a bass. That is why they are so agressive and will hit anything that comes near them. I see people shore fishing on smallmouth spawning beds down the street from my house every spring. When I ask them what they are fishing for they say catfish. You can catch smallies every cast in this area. Must be pretty hard to charge someone for fishing out of season bass when they don't have any in there posession. Is there a fine for disturbing spawning fish thats closed to fishing? I have never seen or heard of a C.O. checking this location for people fishing bass but have seen them 300 mteters down the road at the boat launch, checking fisherman when they come off the water in the evening. Last year they introduced a slot limit on Walleye and are pinching a few people with illegal walleye."
469373,spyder3g,2010-05-25 11:53:00,50,"You can fish whatever is coming on your hook all year around, but you have to release bass now."
469379,BillM,2010-05-25 12:20:00,17367,"  Uh no you can't chief.  At least we found one person here that targets out of season fish.  Good job, you should be banned."
469394,bigugli,2010-05-25 12:54:00,6138,"There are far too many fishing the spawning beds. The same argument every time. ""If the Americans can fish the spawn why can't we? I just release them anyway"" Apparently 300 million Americans can't be wrong"
469407,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-25 13:36:00,932,"There are far too many people that just fish for ""whatever"" without caring about/understanding the implications of what they are doing.  Enforcement is only really executable if you find people with Bass in their white bucket or boat.  They can always say they are sunfishing or catfishing or piking.  Sadly, there are also too many people like this Snyper3G.  He thinks that because Bass isn't open yet that he is allowed to target them as long as he is throwing them back.  To make matters worse, the people who are fishing for ""whatever"" generally have less of an idea on how to handle the fish they do catch and use live bait more frequently (deeper hook sets).  It's pretty grim when you think about shorelines and boats for of idiots hauling out the guts of OOS fish and don't think twice about throwing their minnow or worm out again.  All we can do as concerned anglers is call the MNR or a CO if we are lucky enough to find one. You can say something to the people doing the fishing as well, but that is generally not well received. If they get enough calls on a certain body of water it will be patrolled more often and the regs for that area could even be changed."
469411,alphaalpha,2010-05-25 13:57:00,475," I'm not sure how using spinner baits in shallow waters is certainly targeting bass.  I was out on a friends boat in a smaller lake near muskoka and we were targeting pike with spinner baits.  we caught 7 or 8 pike and only one OOS largie, all in around 5ft of water.  We did promptly move after catching the one bass."
469423,jimmer,2010-05-25 14:32:00,2730,"When there are no pike in the lake!  Most of the kawarthas do not have pike, the central ones anyways.  So if I see someone throwing a spinner bait in shallows, I assume they are fishing for OOS bass."
469424,Flappn,2010-05-25 14:40:00,245,"My buddy has a cottage on Rice, him and I where chatting this morning. He said he was watching all the fisherman in front of his cottage with his binoculars catching bass after bass. What's the matter with people???"
469430,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-25 14:51:00,2690,"It's pretty sad to see people blatantly tearing them off the beds.  Saw a few boats on the reservoir in Woodstock yesterday, fishing right in the bass spawning beds.  Supposedly targeting pike. These same people will be the first ones to cry when there are no bass left."
469431,BillM,2010-05-25 14:54:00,17367, People are stupid.
469434,solopaddler,2010-05-25 14:55:00,8605, Actually for most of the province bass are open year round.  One of my favourite spring pastimes up at the camp is targeting spring smallies on topwater baits.
