468265,BillM,2010-05-21 01:05:00,17367,"My parents are about a mile or so where that took place.  Not a tonne of bears but it's not odd to see 1-2 a week.   They had one up on the porch last year that knocked over the BBQ and licked the grease off it for about 20mins or so, lol."
468276,bigugli,2010-05-21 01:48:00,6138,"Yes it is in the banana belt, and the politicians here avoid any and all discussions pertaining to hunting like the plague.  I grew up just outside Mactier, til 1970, when the family moved us to the ""festering sewer"". Couldn't get out of there fast enough. Never managed to find enough work to make moving back permanently a possibility. A good portion of the family is still strewn across the 'Skokas and Haliburtons. They were the smart ones."
468281,bigugli,2010-05-21 01:53:00,6138,"For most living in Toronto   anything north of Barrie is ""North"". After all they can't really travel south in their cars. There is this small pond in the way."
468308,jjcanoe,2010-05-21 03:12:00,744," Now thats where you're wrong, we did not vote to kill the spring bear hunt, nobody did, it was killed by the P3Ta wackos pressuring the Ontario gov't. it was not an election issue and the hunt cancellation was a HUGE suprise to all with very little (if any) public consultations, the general public had absolutly nothing to do with the cancellation regardless of where they live.  Also, if in fact that the majority of the vote is in the south as well as the population, doesn't that mean the majority of the hunters are also in the south? I find it unlikly that they would be the cause of this....  The hunt was killed by P3Ta wackos (a huge global entity and plenty live in northern Ontario)  jjcanoe"
468440,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-21 15:25:00,0,"I was out fishing yesterday when a guy came by and told me about the bear attack only a few meters from where I was fishing. Apparently the guy was crouched down doing gardening, and the bear took him for an animal.From what I understand the bear was not killed and the ministry relocated it.  The locals say it is possible the bear could have had a cub in the vicinity but still blame the call off of the spring hunt.  I guess they called off the spring hunt to make the bears do their thing, but still, I think it is time to thin out the population considerably, at least in the south. If not during the spring, during the fall."
468571,irishfield,2010-05-21 23:49:00,26272,"Planting a ""garden"" in a crown forest! Amazing how that smell brings everything in .. even bears it seems!"
468626,Cudz,2010-05-22 02:59:00,2652,I heard the same story.  What would you been planting on crown land?  Hmmm.  Not too sure.  Maybe just some flowers or rose bushes to spruce thing up a bit.
468758,NAW,2010-05-22 23:31:00,4022,Maybe he was using some Blood Meal for fertilizer.  Supposedly it works well
470227,cisco,2010-05-27 17:24:00,597,"Many deer hunters have started planting 'food plots' where they use atvs or even farm tractors to scarify the ground and plant seeds which attract and hold deer during late fall. Seems this victim was doing something like that when the bear attacked. Many forms of wildlife benefit from such plantings.... this bear did too unfortunately for the victim. Stuff like clover, wintergreen, turnips, other stuff. Many companies have started to promote such plantings to grow huge antlered bucks and such. I think some of the promo is 'Bull' but at least it gives a reason to go out and plant wildlife food plots which help many of our forest friends. I do believe that during deer season that deer are more prevalent near such plots vs on neighbouring properties. Does and their young go there so bucks will follow during rut."
470235,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-27 17:48:00,0,"  Geralds a good guy. I've known him for years. I was shocked to see his name/face in the paper. He works hard at everything he does. Gardening as well. If he was planting anything besides what is being assumed here, you would have heard about it no doubt. Missed seeing him out on the bay over the passed few weeks. I hope he heals fast."
467798,NAW,2010-05-19 13:46:00,4022,"""A man is in serious conditions after he was attacked by a large black bear yesterday evening.  OPP say the attack happened near Upper Big Chute Road, and Kinnear Sideroad in Severn Township around 6:30 PM.  The 48 year old man's injuries aren't life threatening, and he was airlifted from the scene to Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto.  OPP are now searching for the bear, with the help of the Ministry of Natural resources, who are setting up traps.  Police say people in the area should exercise extreme caution until the bear is located and trapped.  And anyone who sees the bear is asked to call 911""    So now, everyone who see's a Bear in Severn Township is going to call 911.  Not Likely...  How to tell if it's ""the"" bear.  I guess if it doesn't run away from you when you'r yelling at it.  But by that time, it may be to late to call 911."
467816,Musky or Specks,2010-05-19 15:21:00,2710,Time to call the London police
467818,bigugli,2010-05-19 15:32:00,6138,"Now if the victim had been one of them city types 80 kms south, the OPP SWAT team would have already hunted down every bear in a 20 km vicinity."
467820,ColdH20guy,2010-05-19 15:38:00,312,that is right around the corner from me! I saw one on the way to work the other day as well a few miles away from home....same critter maybe
467826,lew,2010-05-19 15:50:00,12766,"Be interesting to know what led up to the attack ??  Did the guy accidentely come on the bear on a trail or in the bush and surprise her, or was it an un-provoked attack or .....  It be good to know any further details if you have them."
467830,NAW,2010-05-19 15:53:00,4022,"There's a big conservation area there, and a quite a few homes.  Not a good spot to have a pissed off bear.  I saw a few bears there last year, but they where scared of me, that's for sure."
467835,ColdH20guy,2010-05-19 16:00:00,312,"The Star said he was just planting a garden with his wife but who knows..maybe a female protecting her cubbies  The victim, a 48-year-old Tay Township man, “appeared to be planting a garden” with his wife when the bear approached, said Ontario Provincial Police Const. Gerry Dwyer.  Dwyer said the man received cuts to his right foot, calf and arm. He was taken by air ambulance to Sunnybrook hospital, where he was listed Wednesday in serious condition.  According to Dwyer, attacks like this one are rare. “We’ve had a few in the past, but nothing major,” he said. “It’s not a consistent thing.”  Dwyer said the Ministry of Natural Resources is searching the area and has set up a trap to catch the bear if it returns.  “We’re advising anybody in the area to keep pets indoors and to exercise extreme caution until the bear is caught,” he said. “Make sure the kids are kept in.”  MNR spokeswoman Jolanta Kowalski said she couldn’t speculate on what might have spurred the attack, but said hunger was likely “not a contributing factor.”"
467837,ColdH20guy,2010-05-19 16:03:00,312,what is the conservation area you refer to FiSH?  not a ton of homes out there..
467880,NAW,2010-05-19 17:46:00,4022,"  My bad, it’s a provincial wildlife area, not a conservation area.  The attack happened near Kinnear sr. and Big Chute Rd.  There are lots of scattered country homes/farms in that aream and a dew cottages as well.  Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying it's a densly populated area.  Just that there are a quite a few homes in that area.  There's a sub-division with about 30 homes in it about 2 block away from where the attack occured."
467884,anders,2010-05-19 17:56:00,1168,Is saw 4 last night in a half hour span...1 was a giant cinnamon bear   I tried to shoot them all but with the dog barking i couldn't get a good shot...

467914,lew,2010-05-19 20:27:00,12766," Just yesterday I planted a garden in the backyard for my wife, only 150' from the edge of the woods.  Perhaps I'd best not show her this post"

467933,glen,2010-05-19 22:00:00,2641,It would have been cheaper to keep the spring bear hunt.  There is bears all over the place up there.  I hope they find the right one.
467941,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-19 22:57:00,10439,  I can see it now Bear Genocide!!! Mass graves in the bush where they toss all the bears they have gassed.
467950,ColdH20guy,2010-05-19 23:17:00,312,now they are saying he was looking for hunting grounds.....oops  FisH- its no big deal but I live about 3 miles from there and was unaware of any wildlife area or subdivision..drove by there today after cruising MacLean Lake for a few hours...  oh well
468074,jjcanoe,2010-05-20 05:35:00,744,"MY RANT.... 1st off I hope the guy recovers fully from his injuries. I guess it's ok to kill this bear since it's in the north, seems that the London police were doing they're job by preventing a bear attack, where were the Coldwater police? That guy should have used all his ""bearwise"" knowledge they drill into your head up north.  Why wasn't the poor bear trapped and brought to some happy place in the north rather than giving it the death sentence, was the nearest bear patrol officer 3 or 4 hrs away?  I guess what I'm trying to say is that a nusiance bear is a nusiance bear no matter where it is, don't give us ""southererns"" a hard time about our problems when you have the same problems which you told us you were ready to deal with (in the London bear post) right in your own back yard.  This is not a north south thing, it's a bear thing, Bring back the spring bear hunt!  jjcanoe"
468076,bigugli,2010-05-20 07:46:00,6138," First you have to convince ""Southern"" urban voters, and their political majority that banning the spring hunt was a mistake. That won't happen until there have been some maulings close to home."
468092,Fish4Eyes,2010-05-20 11:47:00,1022, What he said. People let their guard down way too much with bears in my opinion. It is rare for them to attack but that is not to say they don't.
468103,NAW,2010-05-20 13:09:00,4022,  You call Coldwater North????

468208,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-20 21:09:00,932,Perhaps the bear just couldn't handle the fact that a grown man was gardening as opposed to fishing . . .
