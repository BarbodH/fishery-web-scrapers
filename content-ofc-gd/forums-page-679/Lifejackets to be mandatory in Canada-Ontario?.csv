All I can tell you is the water is cold right now if you fall over and think you will swim for any length of time all the power too you. I for one if im underway Im going to be wearing it do I have a problem being told to wear it no its CDF you only live once and when it comes to someone finding you it is either rescue or recovery Ill take rescue thanks. I would like anyone arguing about this to walk into the water shoulder deep in may and just for poo and giggles see how long you can function swimming without a PFD oh you make sure you have a sane buddy with you. This really isnt a no brainer your rights arent being taken away its very costly to come out and find you only to find out your floating face down or a few empty PFDs floating around  or a couple of weeks later bloated and floating.(very nasty) if they pass ther law it is what it is and thats that. Either way Im okay with it JMO Peter

470302,JayZ,2010-05-27 20:44:00,18," are you for real?  the faster a boat moves, the less the wake. take a ride in a boat one time and you will see for yourself.  as for a 25 mph speed limit, i'd rather not spend 30 min to an hour traveling to my fishing spot throwing up a large wake the whole way there. try driving a 20' + boat at 25mph and see how much wake is thrown.  i've owned several personal watercraft over the years that will do in excess of 60mph on the water. i can honestly say that neither i nor any of my friends have ever run into other people on the water. you see, we are (pwc owners) for the most part safe and responsible boaters. there are a few that ruin it for the rest of us, but that is the same with any group of boaters. i have had more run ins and issues with other boaters while fishing than i have with seadoos.  if you are afraid of being put in danger every time you go on the water you should stay off. water can be dangerous just like driving on the 401. maybe you should not drive over 25mph either because that could put your life in danger."
470303,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-27 20:45:00,0," Not millions.  How many people do all those things you mentioned? Much less after they made it illegal. Thats for sure!  If canoeists knew that it was against the law, they would think twice about venturing out without a life jacket for fear of being fined. Its a simple as that! Therefore I disagree.  Are you saying that you want everyone that operates a water vessel, including a canoe, should attend a boaters class? If they are too dumb enough to understand why a flashlight is needed in case you break down, no amount of education will help these individuals. If you teach them and tell them that if you do it you will get fined? THEN they will understand. If not, they will understand quickly after they are fined. And the enforcement should explain it to them as well."

470307,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-27 20:48:00,0," If the boat is moving? What heat are you retaining? Care to explain that one?  The law from what I understand is for when the boat is in motion. And if your in rough waters? Chances are it will be very windy and you wont be retaining any heat.  Certain laws are put in place to save lives. Now if the odds are astronomical that is different, but there is a significant amount of boaters that are drowning each year because of no life jackets. If your fishing a place like Erie and you fall in the water on a windy day? Even if you are a good swimmer? You will be in danger.  Like I said. It does restrict fishing and it would be a hassle if your running and gunning, but I can see why this law is being considered."
470311,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-27 20:52:00,932," Yep, exactly like those tasty Crappies.  Go get 'em tiger.  Don't forget your PFD.  Sounds like you'll be needing them when you cross the border soon (provided you are still legal to cross into Canada).  Cheers and good luck with that pan-fare."

470387,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-28 00:54:00,0," What does the fact that the Gov has stated they have no intention of making it a law have to do with my reply?  You went from guys over heating to guys peeing off the side?  If you are drunk and/or taking a leek and you fall in the water with a PFD? Chances are you will live to see another day.  I have read and heard numerous incidents that had nothing to do with alcohol or peeing. The fact that the most drownings are from drinking or peeing is irrelevant. The fact that many drownings could have been prevented by a PFD is not.  I can guarantee, that if it was passed as law? Most of those people would be wearing the life jacket. Booze is a lot easier to hide than not having a life jacket on. Its like the seat belt thing. Lots of people still drink and drive but not many drive without wearing a seat belt since the law was passed.  Anyways, I have given my opinion and will leave it at that."

That is just a ludicrous statement in itself, not to mention it is not only the individual's life that is effected, but his/her entire family, friends, ect...  As far as stupidity not able to be legislated? I totally disagree. Many people that would speed, dont speed because they will be penalized, same thing goes with wearing a seat belt. Lets face it. Seat belts save lives. There is no question about that.  Laws like these are obviously not directed at the smart ones but are targeting the stupid ones! Who says it wouldn't be able to be enforced? After getting fined a few times, you will see how fast people start wearing their life jackets."
470086,Dara,2010-05-27 03:39:00,3052," So just how much do you think it costs to make a law.  How many people do you see still driving while talking on a cel phone...how many kids without helmets on bikes, how many people smoking with kids in the car. Its just another politician wanting a law named after him.  I just believe the money would be better spent on education rather than making laws. Have a proper boaters course. Educate people in the safety aspect of wearing life jackets. Those 2 canoeists still wouldn't have had safety gear in the boat no matter haw many laws you make. I hear so many people complaining that they have to have a flashlight in the boat in the daytime. Well guess what...if you break down, you will likely be out there broke till after dark. Maybe put that in a course instead of just grabbing a hundred bucks off somebody that still doesn't understand why."

470225,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-27 17:17:00,932,"My two cents:  ""Common Sense"" is an oxymoron.  With that said, we need reasonable laws.  Mandatory wearing of PDFs for MOVING vessels UNDER 6 meters in length is a reasonable law.  (Moving would mean all paddle boats, inflatables, canoes, kayaks etc.  These are fragile boats in tough conditions and can be high risk).  Naturally, this will be extremely annoying for trolling, but the law needs to be clear and concise.  The law needs to be enforceable, and from what I read, this law is easily enforceable.  This is a rarity for water-based laws.  Boaters can be caught from a mile away and it might aid in keeping them honest with other activities if they think people are looking for life jackets (alcohol, illegal fishing, poaching).  As always, this is another case of a smaller group of people ruining it for the whole (those of us who have enough sense to take our own safety into account).  The law is fine & with the growing list of tragedies, needed."

If/when a mandatory PFD law comes in effect I think a few classifications would be appropriate:  - all small vessels under 16' mandatory pfd all times - 16-24' mandatory pfd while vessel is engaged in motion and leaving a wake...ie not fishing but actually boating spot to spot,          as with tournament anglers - anything over that pfd's on board, not mandatory to wear"
470229,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-27 17:30:00,932," Sadly, that's just the way it goes.  You see a guy hoping into his canoe with a telephone pole and a winch fishing for browns with a twelve pack and no life jacket and you just think to yourself ""this ass is either going to kill himself or make anglers look like idiots.""  You also want to ask to check his fishing license, but you just don't have the authority and don't want to battle with someone who has likely already been in prison.  To play devil's advocate to your small lake argument:  People fall out of canoes all the time.  They tip.  If you're fighting a big pike or get caught in a snag, you could lose your balance and fall out.  You could fall out if you hit an obstruction in the water.  ANYTIME someone falls out of a moving water vessel their life could be in danger.  That is not disputable.  There are countless things that could unexpectedly happen.  You could fall victim to tree branches falling - things of that nature.  You can say these aren't likely to happen, but it truly can happen in a split second.  I don't even think you can make an argument against this, you can only argue that it encroaches on your freedom (and then you start to sound a little like Ben Roethlisberger - before he smashed his motorbike up without a helmet for the second time)."

There is no need of these ciggarette boats or bass boats running around public waters at 85 mph. Thats just rediculous. Bass boats racing for the best spot to fish?  Come on...if they had a 5 mph speed limit in the tournaments then it would be a level playing field, cost of gear would be way cheaper, and it would be about the fishing again instead of which guy has the biggest.........  We don't need personal watercraft running around at 60 mph either. They just run into other people...outlaw them first.

469888,Dara,2010-05-26 16:21:00,3052,"  But we had an old train engine at the park that kids played on for years. It is now fenced off so nobody gets hurt on it.  I'm just saying, think about the laws you make first.  Possibly drinking water should be regulated.  http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/cbc/100525/canada/consumer_con_bottled_bacteria_1"
469894,bare foot wader,2010-05-26 16:31:00,1354,"ummm, YES!!! bottled water should have way more regulation around it...it's really surprising where bottled water actually comes from..."
469898,Dara,2010-05-26 16:41:00,3052,"  See, they were busy making it illegal to smoke in a car with somebody under 18 present instead.  I like the part where an 18yo was busted for smoking with a 16yo present and while the cop was writing the ticket the 16yo lit up and it was perfectly legal.  But lets spend a few mil making it law that you have to wear a life jacket when the smarter people already do. Let the dumb ones die...its better for the human race in the long run."
469900,Tybo,2010-05-26 16:50:00,1373,8 million registered boats in Canada. Lets say 4 life jackets per boat. Taxes on 32 million life jackets. The cost of the law. Made a profit!
469901,Mike Pike,2010-05-26 16:52:00,1332,"I was in a fishing tourney a few years back and the rule was you had to have a life-jacket on while under way.  Once we stopped, the jackets came off and we'd start casting.  I honestly didn't think it was that big a deal."
469902,vince.bornais,2010-05-26 16:53:00,50,"I think you should have to wear a PFD if you are near 6 inches of water anywhere. Rivers, streams, lakes, bathtubs, hot tubs, puddles,.... Why stop at just boating. People die in bathtubs too!!! Maybe the shower too, just in case the drain backs up!?!"
469909,Dara,2010-05-26 17:20:00,3052," We already have to have them in the boat, so no extra profit except for you wear them out faster.    Not a big deal to do it....a very big deal that we are FORCED to do it."
469630,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-25 21:09:00,1107, LOL I slowed down just before I hit a piece of floating driftwood the owner a older gentleman said I wonder how fast this thing will go the lake was flat so I volenteered it was great till I hit that hunk of wood This was a few years ago I would never do that speed now that I have a little one to take care of. it should be mandatory while under power anyone that owns a boat knows how many clowns go flying around way to close to other boats all it takes is 1 collision were people weren't wearing lifejackets and 4 people drown cause they wanted to make their own decisions in life doesn't matter how good a swimmer you are if your knocked out. Life jackets save lives
469633,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-25 21:17:00,10439, Thank God I live in the NWT where you can pretty much do what ever the heck you want. Because I have enough crap on my little pontoon without all the stuff they want you to carry.    Now on my real boat I have all of the required safety stuff and more.
469635,JohnF,2010-05-25 21:24:00,3494,The process to get from talk to legislation is long and convoluted and little gets thru it as originally proposed. That link I posted is the law as it stands.  Not saying it can't happen but it will be a while if it does.  JF
469637,pike n' whities,2010-05-25 21:46:00,131,"I don't care much for wearing mine all the time. If i had one of the $200 inflatable ones. sure i'd wear that 24/7. at least it'd be comfortable! but I don't wear a life jacket unless the weather gets nasty or im doing a speed faster than trolling. other than that no life jacket. only 24/7 when im in a canoe. everyone here has a valid opinion. but it should all come down to personal choice. at least in the hands of an adult anyway. I don't bring young children in the boat anyhow.  anyway, thas my opinion...."
469642,HTHM,2010-05-25 22:01:00,4082,I seem to remember the same outrage at the seatbelt legislation. However it will make diving and swimming off the boat a little more challenging.

469649,irishfield,2010-05-25 22:11:00,26272,Depends on the boat in use.. the people on board and their driving experience.. the weather and what we are doing. 12' tinny or port-a-bote... always have our jackets on. 16' Steel work boat.. maybe. Sitting in a 22' long x high sided Lund... down rigging at 1.66mph with crew on board forget it! Alone.. jacket is always on... and I even tie the 15' mooring rope to my belt in case I take a header loading the down rigger! Hydraulic steering doesn't kick to one side so that the boat comes back to get you!!
469650,Terry,2010-05-25 22:16:00,14456,I wouldn't want to be the guy to tell the owners of 50ft yachts..that their guests have to wear lifejackets and sleep in them if they stay over night and nude sun bathing is out too  oh and you must leave them on while having sex in a boat........
469654,perchslayer666,2010-05-25 22:23:00,280,"I think this is a great idea it will save lives, even if the amount statically speaking is historically low - every life counts. I think some of the old timers on the board have a mind set from a different time and place, and hey guess what - Times change as do provincial laws. Is this seriously a big issue? It sounds like some people on here have an issue with authority and change. I mean the cost of a life jacket has come down immensely in the past few years (even the auto inflatable ones) where everyone who can afford to be out on the water can or should be able to afford one.  This should be praised as a preventative measure to save lives."
469655,Billy Bob,2010-05-25 22:26:00,5865, NYS has a stupid law that says starting Nov 1st to May 1st if aboard a boat smaller than 22' you must wear a life jacket when under way.....that makes the rich and famous who can afford large boats exempt from the law much like the police are exempt from wearing seat belts and Congressmen don't have to pay Social Security and can vote themselves raises.  FIGHT for your rights my fellow Canadian friends.
469667,lookinforwalleye,2010-05-25 22:56:00,4399,I don`t really have a problem wearing a PFD while running at cruising speed but wearing one while fishing would be very uncomfortable.  I would like to know what percentage of the drowning victims were liquored up or doing dumb things like swimming at night while drunk or canoeing at night while drunk.
469676,danbouck,2010-05-25 23:12:00,4380, swap the suit for a pfd
469718,Gerry,2010-05-26 01:37:00,257,"I always wear mine when the main engine is running. This is a rule in tournaments and I just got used to it. I think it is a good idea and long overdue, but only for boats under a certain size, like 22 ft or so. Lets face it, we all said the same when seat belts were made mandatory."

469734,Dara,2010-05-26 02:49:00,3052,Bleeding hearts wanting to save us from ourselves.  You can't regulate stupid.  We need a few more safety laws.  I like the one where kids under 16 must wear a helmet while riding a bicycle. How many kids do you see without them. Do you realize what it costs to make a law?  Millions of tax dollars. And millions of private dollars to update law books. To just not bother enforcing it......   Our city just built a skateboard park. Its made of concrete steps and steel pipe rails for kids to do dumb tricks on. Know why they made it...cause the kids whined till they got it.  Wanna know the regulations for helmets and proper gear in that park?  NONE...the city said it would always be open and if they made a helmet rule they would have to enforce it so they decided they they would just put up a sign recomending it.  Last week my nephew was there and fell and smashed his elbow. 5 hours of surgery to pick the bone fragments out and at 15 years old he will never straighten his arm again.  2 days later his friend ends up with a concussion at the same park. At least they had somebody to talk with in the hospital.   And you want to make a law ordering me to wear a life jacket?  Hands up...who wants to pay for this new law
469749,Sinker,2010-05-26 04:25:00,8692,"My grandfather spent over 70 years on the north atlantic...........as well as most of my family. None of them ever wore a lifejacket, and my Pop couldn't swim a stroke to save his life. A little common sense goes a long ways. Pop is still out there as much as anyone else, still no PFD.  He does, however, have his boaters license  S."
469778,bigugli,2010-05-26 10:58:00,6138,"You are right Chancho, we don't like the changes we see. We see common sense being thrown out the window. We see a new generation needing someone to perpetually hold their hand and wipe their   for them. We see a society that likes placing blame with everybody but themselves when things go wrong, with the usual argument that ""a law be passed to prevent this tragedy from happening again"". What is  there to like."
469779,vince.bornais,2010-05-26 11:10:00,50,"""A little common sense goes a long ways"". A very good saying, too bad alot of people don't have any, or repect for the water and the people that are on it. I have been reading this page for a few years now and decided to recently join. I find it hard not to comment on some of the topics anymore. There have been a number of topics from boat launching to boating etiquette while on the water and it all comes down to common sense & respect, and common curteousy to some extent. Some people just don't have it and it's the rest of us that have to pay for it. I for one firmly believe that failure to adhere to these 3 things should be painful, but why should we all have to suffer for it? People need to know there vehicles, what they can & cannot do, and they need to have a respect for the water."
469780,BITEME,2010-05-26 11:23:00,1968,Im ok with this I think there should be mandatory licensing tests as well the same as for a car to be completed at designated areas Good on the Government for this  Peter
469782,Tarzan's Jane,2010-05-26 11:33:00,1183,"I don't own a boat but neither would I get in one unless I had a PFD.  I don't trust anyone else's driving, (even on a bicycle built for two), nor mother nature.  I know how to float/drift/stay alive without the complications of injuries and without having to fight a current.  Don't be looking to me to help you out or one of your kids - I'm fighting for my own life.  Common sense differs with everyone!  Just wear it!"
469783,vince.bornais,2010-05-26 11:35:00,50,"Licensing tests won't do anything. The whole boaters exam is a farce & a tax grab. And as for car licensing, have you seen Canada's Worst Driver?"
469793,BillM,2010-05-26 12:06:00,17367," I really hope you aren't blaming the park for your nephews busted elbow, or his buddies concussion.  ........I also didn't realize you needed someone to TELL you to wear safety protection..   I did all those stupid things as well in my younger years (skateboarding, amateur BMX racing, motocross, etc) and did I get hurt?  You bet your ass I did... Did you see my parents blame anyone for it?  Of course not, it's called taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions."

But considering all the needless deaths we hear about every year? I am more for it(mandatory), than against it.  I hear they have new lifejackets they are making now that are alot more sleeker. Hopefully they do not impair your movement as the older bulkier ones.  The only thing is that I will have wierd tan lines. To go with my racoon eyes.lol"
469583,bigugli,2010-05-25 19:18:00,6138,What our dear deluded government needs is some good old horse sense. Not another layer of bureaucratic bumpf. Take the money and spend it on real boater education and a real operator licensing program based on that education. Another pathetic set of rules that do not curb stupidity will not help other than waste more tax dollars.

Lifejackets ,PFD's should ALWAYS be worn while under power.I wiped out on a sea-doo and the teather ripped off without killing the engine and I was knocked out cold and ejected from the machine at 70mph (I know too fast) but if it wasn't for the lifejacket I would have been toast. Even at slower speeds you can be thrown from a boat, doesn't happen to often but it can happen. I wear mine when ever the boat is running,the article says they want to make it mandatory for moving boats not all the time . for the more $$$ for the goverment comment they won't make any $$$ if people just follow the rules they suck sometimes but they are not always just a money grab.It takes you 3-4 extra seconds to take it off when you stop or take off .I was out this weekend and hardly anyone wears them, I have been stopped twice for saftey equip checks and both times they have commented on the fact that we are wearing our life jackets .Just watch the commercial with the 2 young kids abbandoned in a boat cause their dad went overboard both kids are wearing them but dad drowned cause he wasn't ."

But I noticed he was wearing a friggin float suit      I was sweating in a tank and shorts, so I asked if he was hot and he said ya but he had not brought his life jacket on board so had to wear the float suit.  Wonder how long before he passed out from heat stroke  As for it being mandatory for the general public, I think that is just not right!!!  Joey"

469605,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-25 20:00:00,0,"  Ohhh ok. Its only for when in motion. Makes sense. I'd be even ok with when its really rough weather(over 3-4 foot waves) on a large body of water even when still. It wouldn't take much to knock a person off the boat. But I don't know many people that would fish in 4 foot waves.  As far as that comment about Fantino? Retire? I like Fantino!  As far as accidents from boating incidents? How many did we hear about on this board alone about fishermen drowning who weren't wearing their life jackets? One too many!!  Its bad enough you see these people on 12 foot aluminums in 3+ foot waves(heading out), they should at least be wearing life jackets."

Anyone with a head on their shoulders will put a life jacket on in a dangerous situation. There are accidents throughout the year and they are just that, accidents.  If someone isn't drowning because they fell out of their boat without a PFD, they will die from heat exhaustion, hitting there head on a rock, hitting another boat at night without any lights, swimming off the back of you boat, etc. I don't want to live in a police state and that is where we're heading if our friend has his way."
469615,skeeter,2010-05-25 20:32:00,1907," as funny as it sounds terry, there is a law that you must be strapped into your bed at all times. if you are a team driving a truck, the driver that is off duty must wear the safety net while in the sleeper. its the same fine as not wearing your seat belt while driving."
