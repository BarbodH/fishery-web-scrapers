470015,ctranter,2010-05-26 23:13:00,543,"  This is a different book, called ""Le Chandail"", which is required for anyone with boys ,  On another note, Le Chandail is a great sociological example of the collective psychology within rural French Canadian society, prior to the quiet revolution.  A prof used it in a sociology class I took and decrypted it page by page, very interesting."
