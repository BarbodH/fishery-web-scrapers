This could contain the loose oil in the Gulf Coast until they figure out how to cap that well.   http://www.wimp.com/solutionoil   Please pass this on to anyone you can think of that will help this idea go Viral.
469772,Paully,2010-05-26 10:32:00,712,They would need alot of hay ... But it seems like a good way to clean up that whole mess.
469777,splashhopper,2010-05-26 10:53:00,2931,"  We have a lot of hay and it is a cheap and renewable resource...  Can you imagine, they could get 2-3 crops of fresh hay and keep shipping it down there and not use anymore chemicals to clean up the chemicals !"
469786,BITEME,2010-05-26 11:43:00,1968,I gotta tell you I was in enviromental remediation for a long time and things are not as easy as they seem especially when you get an unprecidented annomally like this
469791,aplumma,2010-05-26 11:59:00,6896,Sorry what looks like a simple solution actually is not. If you want to help shave your head and send the hair down to the Gulf it will absorb even more oil and will not sink when water logged. As far as using chemicals to collect chemicals being bad... remember even organic matter is made up of chemicals. The spill is a tough issue that we are dealing with and between the politics and the misinformation it is going to prove to have long term repercussions and then we get to try to restore the waters back to their former glory. At this point a prayer for the people impacted by this disaster and a donation to the organizations that are helping will do more than any amount of hay or hair.  Art
