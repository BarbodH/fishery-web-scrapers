470098,pikehunter,2010-05-27 09:39:00,1659,"A happy day to you too Lew  Off to work for me this A:M. Did get out fishing yesterday though, what a scorcher! Then came home and put the window AC units in so we would be able to sleep in comfort. Finally sat down at 'bout 7:00 and the pain in my knee reminded me that I forgot   to go to a doctor appointment for a follow up on it and prob another cortisone shot.  Enjoy the sunshine  today everyone."
