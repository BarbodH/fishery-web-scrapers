468255,splashhopper,2010-05-21 00:39:00,2931," Yep.. i remember seeing that and thought...."" i am pretty sure that ISN'T the way to carry a boat on the roof""...  But dutchy and were sure glad that RichB  offer that tinnie up for us and Ryan brought it over for the tournament.  Speaking of RichB.... where the heck is he ?"
468257,danbouck,2010-05-21 00:44:00,4380, Lots of it
468262,splashhopper,2010-05-21 00:59:00,2931, I loved that guys reports.... tell him to post one soon please
468278,Gerritt,2010-05-21 01:50:00,6129,Last I heard he and Sugarpacket split or something (he or she mentioned it here) and one of them moved down east ....  that was last year I think?  He seemed like a nice enough kid..
468760,ehg,2010-05-22 23:43:00,2666," Have been throwing a 12 ft. on top of a Caravan for over 20 yrs. Really makes most lakes accesible.  Hopefully the pictures will help.  First you have to buy about 5 of the largest, widest styro noodles available at Rona or CTC. Cut one straight line lenghthwise down four of the noodles then attach them to the boat. With a decently strong person at each end of the boat it can be hoisted on to roof.   Also need to get the strongest, largest, long racheted strap available at CTC and get it around the boat and vehicle. Now you can attach and tighten strap.   Cutting a flat section of the noodle and sliding it down the the strap on both sides of windows helps to further tighten and stops the strap from fluttering against window etc... Padding behind the ratchet also prevents scratching of paint and other things   Underneath, need to use folded cloth as the sharpness of metal there wiil cut through styro and strap.   Need to tie front of boat by opening hood and feeding quality rope around motor mount. From underneath pull both ends across hood, one end through some attachment on very front of boat then knot and secure.   Have done this hundreds of times and feel safer than trailering. Hope this helps!"
469151,splashhopper,2010-05-24 22:04:00,2931, Hey Thanks bro....     That took some effort... I appreciate it.  What about the stern of the boat?  Did you tie it to the back of the van too?
469584,ehg,2010-05-25 19:18:00,2666,"Don't need to tie the back of boat as long as you get the big ratchet strap, tie the front well, and use the largest noodles. Had to drill the main frame underneath a little to hook the strap secure. Hooking near the end of leaf springs didn't sit well with me. Everything outlined needs to be done for this to work efficiently This method should work for most mini-vans/SUV's."
469733,John Bacon,2010-05-26 02:39:00,3277,I have seen people use the plastic tie raps to secure steel pipes to roof racks to widen them.  Large tie wraps should work for 2x4's or 2x2's.  Just cut them off when you are done.
469764,splashhopper,2010-05-26 09:26:00,2931,"  That sounds pretty simple too. I am all for ""keeping it simple"".  Thanks"
470131,ehg,2010-05-27 13:11:00,2666,"Ya, good luck with that?! Have tried many different things(including above). When flying down a 400 series of highway to travel a few hours for good fishing, the way i outlined is only way to go, without trailer. Takes about 5 minutes to do once you have a couple of cheap investments. Geez, have fairly severe MS and still pull this off."
470138,wask,2010-05-27 13:39:00,174,"Last weekend we carried my 12 ft. aluminum tank in to a lake near Apsley while my brother in law drove his XL7 down the trail with the canoe on top.  Needless to say, a 3/4 mile hike down a snow mobile trail I wouldn't take my two wheel drive pickup down was a pain in the neck.  We didn't want to carry it back out, so we strapped the paddles to the luggage rack, loaded the boat and ratcheted down the front, back and one around the middle and it went fine.  Actually held on better than the canoe.  I'd go 2x4 though, the oars were a little too wide and hit a couple of trees, haah.    "
467651,splashhopper,2010-05-19 00:49:00,2931,"I just bought my first boat tonight.  A 12 ft aluminum...  The hull of the boat( i think that's the right term.. lol) is 52 inches across and the racks on the roof of my Grand Caravan are only 48""  I am thinking that I can put two 2x4's on top of the rack that are a little wider than the boat to rest it on.  How the heck am I going to attach the 2x4's to the rack.... not enough room under the racks to put a bolt through from the bottom?  Or, is there another way of doing this?  Pictures would help too.  Thanks again.  Splashhopper"
467652,solopaddler,2010-05-19 00:52:00,8605, I used to put a 14' tinny on the roof of my 2 door Blazer LOL!  All I ever did was bungee 2X4's to the roof rack. With the weight of the boat pushing down and tied down well it was solid. Never moved an inch.
467653,irishfield,2010-05-19 00:53:00,26272,DANG.. and I thought you'd be a duct tape kinda guy solo....
467654,danada,2010-05-19 00:55:00,31,we used 2x4 and duct tape them to the roof racks. its not pretty but it wont come apart.
467655,bow slayer,2010-05-19 00:57:00,1074,CT sells cargo racks for your van for wider loads.........you could also call the auto wreckers there is probably a van that has some already on you could pick up cheap.
467658,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-19 01:01:00,1107,Splash could you get a U-bolt under it I have seen that done before just drill through the 2*4 for the ends of the U-bolts size will depend on your roof racks.
467660,Pigeontroller,2010-05-19 01:03:00,2793,"Just remember to tie directly to the rack, not to the bungeed/duct taped 2x4s!"
467661,solopaddler,2010-05-19 01:04:00,8605, Good old 100mph tape. Use it all the time but not for this application.    That's the safest and best thing to do.  As mentioned the bungee cords worked just fine for me and I drove 1000's of km's with the boat on the roof.
467670,pike n' whities,2010-05-19 01:20:00,131,may i point out (since no one else has) that the roof has a maximum weight load.... the one on my olds silhouette is 75lbs max. cap. I considered puttin my 14' on but didnt after I looked that up. I'd invest in a trailer if i was you! theres alot of places i made it with my van. some VERY surprising places too. its too beat up to take those risks now though haha.  
467672,splashhopper,2010-05-19 01:26:00,2931," Might be able to do that... will give it a try,,, failing that.... I will put the duct tape on for a short drive... ( camo tape of course   )"
467676,Governator,2010-05-19 01:31:00,879,We do it all the time on my friends Jeep.  He has two 4x4s horizontally and he cut out a notch on the boards to fit on to the rack snuggly.
467677,splashhopper,2010-05-19 01:33:00,2931, Hmmmm... that sounds easy too
467686,Gerritt,2010-05-19 01:51:00,6129,  Bah! take a risk and live a little!  G
467687,splashhopper,2010-05-19 02:00:00,2931," We have used Grand Caravan's in our business for the past 4 years and have carried full sheets of 1/2"" plywood and drywall stacked 10 deep with no issues...  I would think they weigh a lot more than the tinnie"
467692,Muskieman,2010-05-19 02:14:00,2472,"Instead of using a 2x4 get a Montreal Canadiens Hockey stick ... seems to me and a lot of other people that they aren't using them properly.  You're on the right track. You can use the 2x4's with screw in eye bolts on either end with ratchet straps to secure the boat  A rope from the bow to the front bumper and one to the rear, she's not gonna move an inch.  RFS "
467711,Dara,2010-05-19 03:07:00,3052,Just don't forget to tie the front rope...if you forget it can get stuck under a tire when you drive away. DAMKIKT
467824,TC1OZ,2010-05-19 15:49:00,987,  Just put it on upright! Cuts through the wind lol...  Not the first time I've done it like this. I took Rich's 14 footer to Waterford the same way!  Make sure you strap it down from all sides...   If you don't want to look as ridiculous just use the 2x4's and strap the boat down to the rack/front/back of the van really really good and you don't need to worry about securing the 2x4's.
467849,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-19 16:33:00,1107,  Nice thats Hillbilly right there LMAO anything for a bent rod!!
467858,Roy,2010-05-19 16:57:00,13728," And check the weather forecast. If rain is expected, pull the transom plug or the load will get real heavy real fast."
467862,TC1OZ,2010-05-19 17:03:00,987, Damn straight! I moved to Fort Erie so I would fit in... St. Catharines people always looked at me funny!   Very good point Roy! Also don't leave your gear in the boat lolol.
467865,JohnF,2010-05-19 17:10:00,3494, Does yer van chine walk if you go to fast?  JF
467866,TC1OZ,2010-05-19 17:12:00,987," lol, I got up to 120 KM/H for a good stretch between the falls and fort erie and only slowed down because I realized its just safer... So I'm gonna say no, especially since its really windy in that stretch of QEW."
468070,irishfield,2010-05-20 04:56:00,26272,"OMG one $5 CTC 200 lb rated ratchet strap and a piece of twine...  Sure wouldn't wanna follow behind you..  As good as the utility trailer I followed very shortly today.. that had about 2 dozen 16 foot 2 x 6's  up on a 45* angle over the loading gate, like a huge nascar wing. He hit about 70 KPH and it lifted the tongue and the rear axle of his FWD van off the ground from the down force..   .. and thankfully there was nobody coming the other way as I weaved around him with my 34 ' deck trailer with an airplane on.."
468189,pike n' whities,2010-05-20 18:54:00,131,"  Well, I aint tryin to rain on your parade bud. but I just suggested you look into it. but by all means give 'er and have some fun.   And Gerritt, I have taken plenty of risks with my van. its still a daily driver till I can get my truck when contract negotiations are over. my old truck ('87 f-150 4x4 351 windsor with 8"" lift and a pair of 34"" Super Swamper SSR's) went through alot of stuff too! it finally died 4 years ago on me. alwyas good to take some risks and have a little fun eh?"
468213,splashhopper,2010-05-20 21:38:00,2931, Thanks Pike.... u do have me thinking btw ... lol  if it falls through.... i will try to flag a pickup truck down and bribe him to take me to the lake  Then deal with van later.... lol
