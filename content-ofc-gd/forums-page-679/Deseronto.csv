469881,PERCHER,2010-05-26 15:54:00,787,Head down to Bakers Baits in Napanee ang get yourself a couple spinners called the Canadain mint.They are on the left wall as you walk through the door.Place a large split shot on your line about 2 feet ahead of the spinner and tip the lure with a dew worm.Make sure all of the worm is on the hook don't leave it hanging off.Slow troll (1-1.5km) on the out side of weed edges.And also troll into the thick weeds anywhere from 4ft deep to 12 feet.In the high sun you will find walleye in the thick weeds.The mouth of the Napanee is a great place to start.In the evening try along the hydro lines.I hope this helps and good luck.
