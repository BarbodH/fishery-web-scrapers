I did it out of the usual courtesy I give canoes, only to get sworn at.  Have you ever made a positive post around here..."
469247,cram,2010-05-25 00:54:00,1733," Yeah, i make a few.  Anyway I did edit my post (obviously not before you saw it) but the thing is you preface your story with ""sometimes its a really good view"".  But then i don't know what you mean....so maybe i misunderstood.  I'm sure i'm not the only one.   Either way, its none of my business so i edited teh post.  But i still think no one deserves to be tipped.  I don't give a crap whether that's popular with you or not."
469327,Rattletrap2,2010-05-25 02:47:00,1652,"Yep, with all the long guns registered and everyone having their ""Boat Operators Card"", I have never felt safer! NOT!  Lew, we were taught common sense when our parents lead by example. My Dad always pointed out common courtesy to others when we were in the boat and it is just something we live by today. We follow the rules and look out for one another.  Somewhere along the way, our society has lost this.  Regardless of who has the right of way in a channel, common courtesy has to prevail and those Cops (blasting off in a pack of small boats) that acted like that should be dealt with for their stupidity! Plain and simple!"
469357,fish_fishburn,2010-05-25 10:27:00,1311,I hit the water here at 5am and was off by noon on both sat and sun just to avoid all that was mentioned above. The fishing was lousy anyways. People parking their vehicles 6 ft from each other in the vehicles with trailers only parking lot. Half the vehicles in the parking lot had no trailers. I watched one guy pull his new 3 seater Sea-Doo out of the water and it slid off the trailer half way up the ramp. Trucks stalled in the water because the water is to shallow to launch a big boat. People being towed in all weekend because they have hit rocks. I watched one clown use his big motor to help get his boat on the trailer in 1 ft of water and when he pulled his boat out his stainless prop was toast. Trucks getting towed out of the launch because they backed out to far and got stuck in the sand. It was a CIRCUS. I have heard of at least 15 boats hitting rocks or shoals this weekend. With the water being down about 5 to 6 ft here on the Ottawa things are not looking good. Now if I could only invent a pill for stupidity I would be a rich man. Like my dad said on the weekend common sense isn't very common anymore.
469368,pikehunter,2010-05-25 11:37:00,1659,"You're Dad's a smart guy, too bad there aren't more boat operators as smart as him.  Many of us have been that person in a canoe or any other type of small boat and had to deal with those lunatics kicking up a high wake. Doesn't matter if you are in open water or not, ""captains""   of bigger craft still have to be on the lookout for the safety of others. Even if it means you have to be inconvenienced by slowing down.  Two reasons I didn't fish this past Victoria day weekend, #1 is the idiots on the water, and #2 is the fact the one who wears the pants   in the family and I put in a new kitchen floor. I have tomorrow off anyway and will hook up and launch then when hopefully the morons are at work.  Wayne: Should have told her to wait right there while I shoot back to get my camera! Smart ass arrogant little carp eh!"
469405,ohhenrygsr,2010-05-25 13:28:00,947,Yep i don't ever go out on long weekends in the boat.  It's just not worth it.  I was at the town docks in Orillia and had a guy unload his boat and left his truck and trailer blocking the entire ramp while he was loading up his boat with gear.  A guy came over to him and asked him to move his boat over to the docks to load his gear so he did but never moved his truck.  I guess he never got the hint that the Boat launch is only for boat launching.  So the guy that asked him to move his boat got into his truck and moved his vehicle out of the way for the rest of the people waiting to launch.  It was quite funny.
469406,jimmer,2010-05-25 13:33:00,2730,"For those of you that weren't fortunate to fish lower Pigeon Lake this weekend, you missed the watersport events.   The loudest and most obnoxous were three boats that made a whole section their personal race track.  I doubt there was a fish for miles that would bite after their run.  Yes, everyone has the privileage of using the water, but can't they go in a straight line up the lake then back, while racing rather than constantly doing donuts and tearing up the weeds.  Had a buddy out with me and he was completely amazed at the disregard for other boaters and how close they were running around each other at high speeds.  I just replied that we would should stay ready to rescue them when they crashed.  The most unfortunate thing is that they live on the lake and we will have to endure this until freeze up! I don't think I will fish the kawarthas on the next Victoria Day Long Weekend."
469412,lew,2010-05-25 13:58:00,12766," Just to clarify, there were no other boats in the area and myself & the canoeist were the only 2 boats in sight. When the paddler saw me approaching, she was still on the edge of the channel and stopped to let ME pass, but seeing as there was nobody behind me and I didn't want to take ANY chance of causing her and her son  grief I motioned for her to go ahead and cross safely.  When the yahoo in the tinny approached from behind he had a clear and unobstructed view all around and could have gone a dozen  different ways to keep everybody safe, but instead decided to take the most direct route available and that was almost over the stern of the canoe.  Absolutely no need to do it other than the fact that he had NO concern whatsoever for the safety or well being of the people in the canoe.  I agree 100% that small vessels, or anyone for that matter, shouldn't be blocking or impeding the flow of traffic in a channel, but that definetely wasn't the case here."

I wish the OPP had both boats in the water in Honey Harbour, they could have gotten Ontario back in the black by handing tickets out to all the yahoos! I can't tell you how many dirty looks I got because I was putting along at 9km/hr or slower. Never mind out front of Picnic Island. I'd love to see a couple more OPP boats out there. Don't get me started on right of way either. Sailboats have the right of way, canoes should as well. It just makes sense."

And, by the way, your statement about less wake on plane than off is seriously flawed. Those who choose to be considerate to small craft and canoes can slow down sufficiently to avoid wake if there is no possibility to give them a wide berth."

470031,bass boater,2010-05-27 00:27:00,2,"  Hey John,  Thanks for your vote of confidents.  I can see by my comments that the truth hurts certain individuals, thus the removal of my post.  It seems that they can dish it out but they can't take it back.  Anyways, I guess I should not have mentioned the name of one of the contributors to this site, but I really hate being stereotyped because I own a bass boat that I am one of those guys who have no consideration for the small crafter.  This is not true at all, I welcome anyone and any size boat that they can afford, at least they are out there participating in water sports.  Since my post was taken off this site then to be fair I feel that fish farmers post should also be removed, which original got my back up, and felt that I needed to defend myself and fellow bass boaters.  I read the articles on this site frequently and the first comment that I make gets retracted, come on fair is fair, and we should all be free to state our opinions, as what most of what this board is opinions.    Before I end this post I would like to draw your attention the video link below regarding boat wake on and off plane.  I think that this will conclude my observation regarding smaller wake on plane verses off plane.  As you can seen in the first part of the video the 200 HP is throwing a wake while running at a moderate speed, as the tinie crosses the wake it grabs some air.  At the end of the video the 200 HP accelerates past the tinie and this time when the tinie crosses the wake it barely leaves the water.  Watch the video it is a fact and not just an opinion.    Next time you are on the water try it out for yourself.  I am not saying that you should not slow for a smaller craft, it is the law,  but sometimes slowing can create more of a problem.  I think what needs to be looked at more seriously is the wakeboard boats whose design is to create a wake, when they come close to a smaller craft, canoe,  they do not slow as was many cases I experienced this past week-end.  this is perhaps a post for another time.  Safe boating,  Bass Boater"
470039,Cookslav,2010-05-27 00:45:00,1457,"   Ya I didn't bother to fish either... I gave the boat a good run just to work out the cob webs from winter storage, but In truth I had no desire to fish in the midst of the chaos of jet ski's, tubes, and speedboats.  Just to much traffic for me....maybe next week"

469012,lew,2010-05-24 10:20:00,12766,"With yesterday being such a nice day my wife and I decided to put the boat in the water and go for a spin for a couple hours. We ran up Clear then cruised around Stoney then headed for home again. We were coming south in the channel thru Hells Gate just below the Church On The Rock and there's a lady and small boy in a canoe heading across the channel just ahead of me so I put the boat in neutral and waved to her to pass in front of us.  She waved thanks and proceeded across and just as she's about 60 - 70 feet in front of us here comes a guy in a 14' tinny wide open and heading right for us. I assume he's gonna pass behind me but nope, he goes right between us and the canoe and just keeps on flying and disappears behind the islands without a clue as to what he just did, infact he never even looked back to be sure they were alright. The lady and boy in the canoe both had a tight grip on their boat as they bounced in his wake and I thought for sure they were gonna tip, but fortunately everything turned out OK and they continued on their trip.  I spose maybe it's not a huge deal but it just shows how easily accidents can happen. This guy had absolutely no concern whatsoever for the safety of the lady and child in the canoe and didn't even take the time to look back as he flew past them not 30' away.  That's the whole story and I just felt like passing it on, but I'm sure every one of you has seen similar things on the water.  Be careful folks, specially in smaller boats, there's some real fools out there that we have to share the lakes with."

469021,Rich Clemens,2010-05-24 10:50:00,3131,I see that once in a while up on the French - lots of canoes and kayaks up there.  We'll drop it back to a slow 'trolling speed' as we come near and pass.  Sure would be easy for one of them to tip over and possibly have some bad results.  We've seen a few boats roar right past without the first thought of their safety.  Just have to shake your head in disbelief.   We too make sure they're OK.
469022,archer379,2010-05-24 10:54:00,277,it seems to me that the way people drive on the road has followed to the water as long as its not within a few inches of them car or boat its not there problem the things they are doing or the place they ae going is the most inportant thing in the world a beep the rest of the world. Last summer out on the ottonabee river south of peterborough in a small 14 tin  boat these 2 ass hats in these 25 footish boats come flying up the river (aera posted no wake ) the wake was big enuff to that when the bow came down we took on water there was a couple of guys in a canone they were close to shore and were able to hold on to a tree other wise i would have bet they would have been swiming
469023,lew,2010-05-24 11:08:00,12766," Actually this guy was probably in his late 40's, early 50's and was certainly old enuff to understand what he was doing.....at least you'd think so anyways."

469039,Fish Farmer,2010-05-24 12:56:00,2234,"Lew, rules and common sense come to play. This happened at the Orillia Perch Fest. On lake simcoe side, their was about sixty boats anchored canoes small 12'ers and so on Perch were right their near the end of the channel markers. Guys with their cruisers & big Bass boats with 250's just had to show off how fast they can go, roared close to the pack of small boats fishing. Like you said, big wake, boats rocking, canoes all most tipping. Going that fast, if a small tinny decided to move out of the crowd and he hit the 12'tinny with a couple little kid's, I wouldn't want to see the results  . Later, the Police boat came out checking boats for their safety equipment, I jumped right on him telling him he should be chasing those idiots roaring close to the small boats. The cop told me that they were in the right, soon as they get outside the channel they can go as fast as they want  . I felt like climbing all over that cop.    Safe Boaters Card makes me sick. After he checked the boats, just to be an idiot, the police boat roared by us as if he was proving something  .   One thing that is not in the boaters test, is they should have a courtesy common sense part of the test. ""Some"" of you Bass Boat guys, were fishing for perch, Bass season is closed. If your trying out for a TV show, your not starting on the right foot. Go roar some place else. I thought Bass boats were made for fishing."
469069,doubleheader,2010-05-24 15:06:00,497,"Boaters are responsible for their wake regardless of whether or not they are in a no wake zone. I had a talking with a couple kids on jet skiis just this weekend. They were running right into the launch almost wide open, causing all kinds of wake. The good news was they at least listened, most of the time people look at you like you're just a jerk. Also this weekend saw 3 different boaters securing their gear right on the launch incline. Kids playing behind their boat while the adults were stowing gear, no tire blocks or anything, one guy actually was crawling underneath his trailer while on this steep incline. People just don't think."

I was getting ready to go and help him when he finally quit. If he does it again I will call the OPP though, there might not be any law about STUPID but there must be some charge for reckless operation or something they could charge him with. Besides, no one could be that stupid without a few drinks in them!"
469075,POLLIWOGG,2010-05-24 16:32:00,835,"Actually Roy the canoeist may not be fault free by crossing a channel and impeding the flow of traffic. If the canoe swamped and this ended up in court it might go 50/50.  WE are so lucky in Ca. to have so much water available to us but we mistakenly claim to have a territory around our boat and judge others according to our feelings and not the boating regs.  I had a boat fly by me about 15' away and not rock my boat at all because the hull was out of the water, speed doesn't always = wake. Deep v's give less wake the faster they go.  Whenever you hear a complaint that starts I was in a channel its never that clear cut.  When I was commander of the local power squadron I'd get all kinds of complaints about the cops playing chicken and swamping boats trying to zip in and gotcha. You don't want to ever be  anchored from the side of your boat when the cops show up, a wake can flip you pretty fast."

What floors me is the more people don't end up paying for their, and others, mistakes with their lives more often.  BTW if you are in a canoe and run into problems DO NOT grab the gunwales, it always makes your situation worse, and almost guarantees that you will end up in the drink. Gunwale grabers kill.  And another thing while I'm on my high horse: It is spelled gunwale, but pronounced gunnel, like tunnel. Don't spell it gunnel and don't pronounce it gunwhale.

469083,Dara,2010-05-24 17:51:00,3052,"Its just too many people for me. I was in North Bay for the weekend. I wanted to fish nippising with my daughter for a bit. Turns out we didn't have a lot of time but we had a good visit. We went out in front of the sewer outlet friday night and joined the 30 or so other boats. No fish but i think its a bit early in the season...thats my excuse anyway. After waiting in the lineup we got out and one guy said he caught one.  Next day we heard Nosbonsing was a good choice so we decided to go there. While driving over I told my daughter that when her and her brother settled somewhere that possibly her mother and I would move close to them to keep us all together..Maybe North Bay area or whatever.  Well, we gets into the lineup to launch and head out onto the lake. There was a good wind blowing so it was pretty rough. We tours around and fish a bit. There are boats running around everywhere. Zing, zing, zing, zing. Then a couple parties start at cottages. Loud music and lots of people trying to be heard talking louder. I'm thinking...wow..If I lived or had a cottage across the lake from that...I looks at my daughter and says...Sarah...remember what I said about moving...skip it...I'm couldn't take this...she kinda smiled and agreed.  Next day we are walking along the North Bay waterfront in the morning. About 30 or 40 boats out near the sewage outfall again. We are walking along watching them...all of a sudden they are all bunched together...I says...hey, Sarah...look...somebody musta caught one.  And the drivers there are the same as the boaters you guys are talking about.  Our city council keeps trying to entice people to come live here...I feel like going to the next meeting and slapping all of them.  I'm heading out fishing at 4 this afternoon...I will be snacking on walleyes tonight.

I am referring to places were you can not see from shore to shore. I will come off plane for any boat that I will cause to be in distress by my actions but will also clue them in to how unsafe an environment they are playing in. This has nothing to do with the area you described and going on and off plane is expected and should be done.  Art
