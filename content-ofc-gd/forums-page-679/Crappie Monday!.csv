And we also caught enough sunfish to feed the entire town of Markham...LOL   a little bit exaggerated...but it was A LOT!!!!   . Unfortunately...we caught everything, but walley...Well...maybe I shouldn't say ""unfortunate"" because I caught a LOT OF FISH, and I had a lot of fun!!!! Yea it was a great day on the water...getting sun burn  lol "
