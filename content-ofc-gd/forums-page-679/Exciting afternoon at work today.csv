469664,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-25 22:45:00,10439,So here I am sitting in my office yaking on the phone with Solopaddler and all these sirens are going off as a string of fire engines go racing past my office to a fire about 3 or 4 blocks away. I look out the window and to my surprise it is an apartment building (not good). Thick black smoke is billowing out of the roof and there are flames to be seen in the smoke. Interesting to watch but I can only think where are all these poor people going to sleep tonight and where are they going to live when the fire is out? Sorry about the poor quality cell phone pics.

469666,irishfield,2010-05-25 22:49:00,26272,Well hopefully it's not an airplane on the roof with 2 dead like Buttonville this afternoon...
469681,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-25 23:22:00,10439,Here's a couple of videos of the action. In the second one there is a helicopter dumping water on the roof of the building.  http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/1003/DRIFTER_016/?action=view&current=ykfire.flv  http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/1003/DRIFTER_016/?action=view&current=ykfire3.flv

Infact there was a similar fire on top of a hi-rise in Toronto just a couple weeks back.  Lotsa fire, smoke and great photo ops, but relatively easy to extinguish and often with very little $$$$ loss.  Not saying fer sure that's the deal, but that's the way it appears to me from the pictures.  Be interesting to hear the whole story once you get the details Drifter."
469699,Cudz,2010-05-26 00:45:00,2652,lol. Just kidding.
469705,splashhopper,2010-05-26 00:59:00,2931,I didn't know they had hi rises in Yellowknife... I thought it was the land of igloos
469706,solopaddler,2010-05-26 01:01:00,8605,"So, what's the outcome?"
469707,danbouck,2010-05-26 01:01:00,4380," and they have cars?  , I thought they put wheels on the dogsleds for the summer!"
469724,Joey,2010-05-26 02:12:00,9122,"Wow, that is exciting.  I work in the Markham/Richmond Hill area and had the plane on the roof accident this afternoon.  Not too far from my office.  Very sad and as Wayne said, two people lost their lives  Hope everyone in the apartment was okay.  Joey"
469731,MJL,2010-05-26 02:34:00,2427,Hope everyone's OK...  The only exciting thing I ever saw while at work was watching a bad driver parallel park into the cars both in front and behind it X 3...Then turning the fire hydrant on the sidewalk into a fountain...Then driving off...
469737,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-26 03:02:00,10439,"  I'll update when I find out tomorrow.    Wheels on the dog sleds, PUHLEEEEZE!!!! We have separate summer sleds that already have wheels on them. They're called QUADS!!!"
469740,MJL,2010-05-26 03:12:00,2427, Like this?  
469743,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-26 03:28:00,10439,  Exactly!!! That's how they train the dogs during the summer.

469872,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-26 15:26:00,10439,"Here's some more video and pictures of the fire. We don't have a solid answer of what started it yet, but it started in an apartment on the 14th (top) floor and was sucked into the air handling system and spread to the roof.  Yellowknife Fire"
