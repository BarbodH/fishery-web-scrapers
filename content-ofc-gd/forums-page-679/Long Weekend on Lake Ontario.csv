469597,Jen,2010-05-25 19:40:00,833,"It was a great day on the Water on Sunday with Fishmaster ( Steve)  We did 6 for 8, after searching for the fish for a while we found them in almost 200 feet of water.  On a day when everyone was slow at catching we were managing to keep the lines peeling out on a fairly regular basis.  40' back 144 ' down running moonshine bloody nose did the best on the riggers for me this weekend.  Wire didn't hit at all.  We headed back in at around 3:00 to gas up the boat and unwind for the day... no such luck... left gas dock and a coupling went on the starboard engine... We had to haul the boat home...  A full maintenance check and she will be back in the Water for Charters this week...  Thanks for a great day out there Steve ... However early a start it was!   All fish today were released!  This is the first time I have personally seen an Atlantic caught on Lake Ontario.       "

469920,SlowPoke,2010-05-26 17:39:00,2984,"I can't believe Percher didn't comment on the Scotty downrigger being used to pull the engine!   It amazes me how one day all the hits will be on divers, the next day riggers, the next day leadcore and when I go out, they're not hitting anything!! LOL  If my north shore skunk continues I might have to give Fishmaster Charters a call and fish a little closer to the Equator. Great report, info and pictures as usual!  -Brian"
469929,PERCHER,2010-05-26 18:07:00,787,See I told you they could lift an engine Brian.
469956,SlowPoke,2010-05-26 19:48:00,2984,You were right! They do a good job lifting these too..  They almost weigh as much as the 4.3's in the Thompson!
