I had a good week for both total pike and large fish but it started out poorly.  After two days of frustration I abandoned the normally productive bays and concentrated on the entrances and nearby shorelines of these bays. When I made the switch I started hitting fish. If your are having trouble locating the pike you may want to try this.  I'm heading up again Friday. If I find something that is working I'll post it when I return. Did anyone establish a pike pattern this past week?"
