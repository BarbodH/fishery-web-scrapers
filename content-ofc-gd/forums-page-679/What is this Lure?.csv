469728,OhioFisherman,2010-05-26 02:30:00,6623,"Flatfish used to be a hot lure on lake erie when my dad was younger for walleyes and blue pike. Needless to say when we started going to Canada it was his lure of choice. LOL I never caught a walleye on one, pike seemed to love them and the occasional bass ate them. A lot of spin offs, and there where similar store brands sold here in the states.  They do have a good action to them, Beno also made a similar lure, (Mill Run products out of Cleveland Ohio)."
469738,Cudz,2010-05-26 03:07:00,2652,"Nope, dave524 got it correct. The lure you are looking for is the Luhr Jensen Fishback. Case closed. Here are 4 of them for sale on ebay.  Pretty cheap too. http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=280484112576"

470003,splashhopper,2010-05-26 22:26:00,2931, Dang... archie is 5 minutes away... i never thought of him and I will be dropping by for minnows from him soon too  Thanks
469222,splashhopper,2010-05-25 00:19:00,2931,"  ""Broken Bobber"" has a red and white one too and doesn;t know the name of it either.  Help us out now please.  Thanks"
469224,ColdH20guy,2010-05-25 00:22:00,312,looks like a canadian wiggler or similar.... http://canadianwiggler.com/ecom.asp?pg=canadianwiggler

469227,Tom McCutcheon,2010-05-25 00:26:00,627,Or a Flat Fish....
469229,ColdH20guy,2010-05-25 00:30:00,312,hmmm where did my first post go? canadian wiggler?
469231,Bly,2010-05-25 00:33:00,1556,"another to ponder, the kwik fish."
469232,Garry2Rs,2010-05-25 00:34:00,1425,I don't think it's any of those... CW had a concave head and no flare. Flat fish didn't have flared heads and neither did Ike's as I recall.
469237,cram,2010-05-25 00:39:00,1733,kwikfish or flatfish have the best action from that family of baits.  (at least for pike).
469258,Drock6687,2010-05-25 01:08:00,90,kwik fish
469262,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-05-25 01:20:00,0,canadian wiggler. flatfish has a much flatter head...  haven't heard of a lazy ike.  must be an old timer thing.
469265,splashhopper,2010-05-25 01:29:00,2931,hmmmmm... no consensus yet.... where are all the OLD guys ?
469269,Roy,2010-05-25 01:32:00,13728,Definitely none of the above.....might be a custom bait. I'll search.
469279,irishfield,2010-05-25 01:46:00,26272,Thanks for speaking up first Dad!
469285,splashhopper,2010-05-25 01:53:00,2931,  There are more ol boys than u two guys... maybe they went to bed already!  It doesn't look like a custom bait though... it looks old ... maybe Broken Bobber can take a pic of his and post it on this thread too.
469287,wankerjohn123,2010-05-25 01:55:00,117," Mine is up at the cottage, won't be there until next month.   "
469290,splashhopper,2010-05-25 01:56:00,2931, How old do u think it is ?  I think mine has to be at least 10 years or more
469318,Bernie66,2010-05-25 02:35:00,123,"   I have a couple of these lures in yellow.  I think they must date back to the seventies. If I remember correctly, they were made by Luhr Jensen.  I picked they up at a dumpy tackle shop down on Kingston Rd in east end Toronto called Rebbies a few years ago.  That place carries tonnes of out dated lures."

469360,dave524,2010-05-25 11:10:00,4508,"The one I have is the middle one on the right hand side, the glo phlorescent green, it has very stout galvanized hooks, probably got it for pier casting staging Kings at night. Flatfish type lures were at one time very popular for salmon in the lake, Heddon had one called a "" Tadpolly "" I did well with on spring Kings, Luhr Jensen had the ""Fireplug ""  a spring fishing staple in the late 70's,  "" Kwikfish "" was popular as it handled speed better then the Helin  "" Flatfish "" and my personal favourite was the ""Canadian Wiggler "" in the jointed model great on salmon and deadly on Erie eyes too, for eyes we would add a bit of nightcrawler to the front treble. There were probably others too."
469361,Spiel,2010-05-25 11:14:00,9065,"  Dang, you beat me to it Dave.    "
469415,solopaddler,2010-05-25 14:02:00,8605,"  Still have a couple of Fireplugs somewhere. Lots of Tadpolly's, they're deadly (and still sold).  Good call on the Fishback!"
469712,splashhopper,2010-05-26 01:20:00,2931,  The head of the lure looks a LOT wider on the one I have. But I think it's close.
469719,wankerjohn123,2010-05-26 01:50:00,117, YEP! That's it... The one I have is the bottom right. My old faithfull....ALWAYS catch Pike with it.  Thanks for finding that photo.
