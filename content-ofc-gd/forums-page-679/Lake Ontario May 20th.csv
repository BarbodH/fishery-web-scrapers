468429,limeyangler,2010-05-21 15:04:00,5204,wow.....great fish right there.  the water looks like glass....lol....the first and only time i went out from Erieau the conditions were like that too...my sandals were melting it was so hot.
468493,rock34,2010-05-21 18:22:00,215,Great repot.  Nicely done. Can I ask what you mean by wire divers?
468530,daking_eh2007,2010-05-21 20:30:00,31,Down 750ft!!! How long did he manage to reel that big fat chinook? Great report!
468540,TC1OZ,2010-05-21 21:15:00,987,"Awesome report, looks like fun!  I need to go on one of your charters as I know I'll never get the boat or gear for that!"
468546,wallacio,2010-05-21 22:16:00,475," This term usually refers to a diving disc such as a Dipsy Diver on a rod/reel with copper wire line and usually a flasher with a fly is used as the actual ""lure"".   It's a deadly combo as divers run out and away form the boat and you feel every headshake with that copper wire line.  Nice report Fishmaster - care to share any more details ie what depth of water you were fishing and in what general area of the lake?"
468556,rock34,2010-05-21 22:58:00,215, Cool thanks.  I am aware of Dipsey Divers but I have never used the wire aspect.

469398,anders,2010-05-25 13:04:00,1168,solid fish!
469469,PERCHER,2010-05-25 16:00:00,787,Now that's how it's done.Great job.I'll tell you if I ever was in need of a salmon charter you would be the man for sure.Nothing like a boat full of HAPPY customers.Good going Steve. Dan
469761,SlowPoke,2010-05-26 08:42:00,2984,Not many charters will put you on a day of big fish. Most are content with quantity not quality. Looks like Fishmaster can do both!
470384,Fishmaster,2010-05-28 00:39:00,920,I don't like catching small fish lol...and those Scottys are tough pulled 2 10lb balls up from 250 last week ...
