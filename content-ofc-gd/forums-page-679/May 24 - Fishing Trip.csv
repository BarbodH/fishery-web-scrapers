Felt good to disconnect for a few days, we had zero cell reception the whole time so that was a bonus for me.  Many thanks to BUSTER for sending me this location last year and we finaly took advantage it  We loaded up the Jeep and headed on our way    There are two access roads to the lake and we took the wrong one at the start.  However we were rewarded with a black bear running out of the bushes infront of our jeep.  He stopped on the other side to check us out for 5seconds and took off.  Sadly I missed the pic as he continued his jog before I could snap but it was an awesome moment.  Anyway we arrive at our destination and my buddy Ash starts unloading:     Our little island for camp was just 500' from shore on the left:     We setup camp and were on our way:     Our view:     Unfortunately the walleye weren't biting for us on day one.  I was sad:     Saturday Morning we started the day off with some bannock:     After a long day of fishing we both finally landed an 'eye from the same hatch, both about 21"".       It was dinner time for us:       We landed a couple more walleye over the weekend but most importantly it was a nice break from life. Here was a nice pic to end a peaceful trip:  "

469555,BUSTER,2010-05-25 18:25:00,1336,"oHH man thats awsome.. heck a friend and myself where talking about this spot on the week-end!!!!! All we cought over 4 days was lots of pike,we said ahh this wouldnt happen if we just went to ash lk.  Really happy you guys had a good time!!  When your ready for your next trip let me know!"
469816,Governator,2010-05-26 13:08:00,879,"  That's hilarious, if you went there you would've been thinking who are these jerks who stole our spot?  lol.  Would've been a heck of a boat ride to another island as we took 2 trips.  Thanks again for the spot, it was a nice bonus having amazing weather all weekend."

470157,Hedfish,2010-05-27 14:14:00,76,Nice trip and great report!
470285,ohhenrygsr,2010-05-27 19:56:00,947,Man that bannock looks awesome you have a recipe?  Awesome fish by the way
470287,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-27 20:08:00,0,Great Report. I fished in Sudbury and was told there were alot of bears in the area. We waited around at the dumpster but they never showed up!And that fish batter looks great! What is it??
470288,Governator,2010-05-27 20:15:00,879,"  Thanks it's pretty basic recipe really.  Something like this:  1 cup of whole wheat flour (Comes out tasting a lot nicer than white imo) teaspoon of baking powder tablespoon of milk powder tablespoon of sugar pinch of salt  I just throw all the dry ingredients in a ziplock bag.  When you mix in your water at camp try to keep it thick, should sort of look like a softball.  I just cook it in a bit of oil in the frying pan (on a low-med heat if possible).  Takes approx. 10min per side.    Just make sure you shake the frying pan until it seperates itself because if it sticks to it you're screwed (Happened to 1 of the 3 on the weekend, makes a crumbled mess)."
470290,Governator,2010-05-27 20:18:00,879," Yea it was cool to see the bear, just glad I never saw one around camp lol.  It was Fish Crisp Garlic Butter (new to us).  We added water to it, made it more pub style.  Honestly, not a big fan of it, has a strong bold taste.  I think I'll stick with beer batter or plain italien in future."
