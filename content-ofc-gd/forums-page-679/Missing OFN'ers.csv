470443,solopaddler,2010-05-28 10:33:00,8605,Whatever happened to Smokey? He dropped off the radar a while back..
470446,lew,2010-05-28 11:00:00,12766, He's doing fine Mike
470450,solopaddler,2010-05-28 11:16:00,8605, Well that's good to hear. I'm going to miss his fly in trip reports though.
470455,bigugli,2010-05-28 11:28:00,6138,The Sicilian fire department?
468842,Carp,2010-05-23 12:58:00,1488, I fit into that category as well  Paul.
468855,Jewelbee,2010-05-23 14:12:00,422,Where's that guy....you know.....the one.....Rick Obanion
468856,irishfield,2010-05-23 14:15:00,26272,Hey Erik... you missed an L ! lol
468857,Terry,2010-05-23 14:21:00,14456," LOL..yeah I knew, I didn't think many other knew"
468912,Photoz,2010-05-23 20:35:00,792,Yup . . .  .    I'm still here . . . .    healthy enough to be demoted to working indoors . . .   sorting mail . . . .   on the midnight shift .. . . .   a fate worse than death to someone who loves the outdoors. Been chasin' carp for the last couple weeks . . .   not catchin' many. I do check out the board when I have time. Speaking of poor ol' lost souls . . . .    anybody hear from CANADAVE lately . . . . .    I miss his musings & ramblings!
468915,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-23 20:50:00,0,Photoz............     
468935,pike slayer,2010-05-23 23:03:00,1177,i see nobody has missed me!!
468939,fishing n autograph,2010-05-23 23:23:00,2540, You were gone???
469146,danbouck,2010-05-24 21:57:00,4380,I know where a few guys are hiding.  Clamp it was on the Long Point page for a couple days
469152,splashhopper,2010-05-24 22:06:00,2931,"Hey, I forgot to ask about Bly... and here she is posting this weekend.  Sorry about that Bly... I love your reports too"
469155,camillj,2010-05-24 22:12:00,1988,And some of us have kinda run out of things to say ... that we havent already said before
469157,irishfield,2010-05-24 22:16:00,26272,"Exactly Jon! People have lives.. and lives to live.. families to deal with etc. Posting on a fishing forum isn't always at the forefront. Why do people feel the need to guilt them to post, when they obviously have other issues at hand that are much more important??"
469166,Bly,2010-05-24 22:45:00,1556," No worries   I hope to have at least one report before the summer is over  lol   Regarding being ""missing"".....what Wayne said."
469168,Tybo,2010-05-24 22:47:00,1373,"What you on about Wayne. My life isn't about going to a nasty job,so I can go fishing and buy fancy boats and gear!!!"
469185,Joey,2010-05-24 23:31:00,9122, Don't you mean Bigfish1965
469208,Jewelbee,2010-05-25 00:00:00,422,LOL! Yup.. that would be him
469371,pikehunter,2010-05-25 11:49:00,1659,Lew gotcha Dave. Someone had to do it.
469627,pike n' whities,2010-05-25 21:06:00,131,"I'm here! and TRYING to put up a speck report with pics. but the fish aren't co-operating, and when that happens I usually dont take pics.   It's amazing that Dangles still checks this site out once in a while"
469653,fishing n autograph,2010-05-25 22:21:00,2540, Yeah he got lucky...its the power of the mustache haha
470385,archie_james_c,2010-05-28 00:49:00,618, Wel...if it isnt little Whippy McWhippy The Whipped ex-fisherman.
470389,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-28 00:58:00,1107,  LOL I remember that didn't take long for him to disappear
470395,Nanook,2010-05-28 01:37:00,565,"Me a long time OFNer, but dont post too much.............and nobody misses me!"
470397,wask,2010-05-28 01:38:00,174,"I have to admit, I'm a fair weather OFC'er.  Once fishing is over, I spend all of my time on the West Virginia football and basketball message boards.  Love it when i'm here though."
470440,DT10Sam,2010-05-28 09:29:00,480,"I have resorted to sitting on the side lines since I am working overseas and at times can not really post on active threads due to the fact of being out of range for some satellite internet connections etc.  Presently I am in Melbourne Australia and finishing up my work here and then heading on Monday to New Zealand for 3 weeks and then Singapore and then back home to Ontario by mid July for some bass fishing and back overseas by the first week of Sept.  The worst part is that I have been trying to get together with a couple of guys here to go out on the ocean fishing and things just have not been able to materialize as of yet so when it does happen I will post from somewhere out on the ocean between Australia and New Zealand.  Talk to everyone soon, and I will sit on the side and read the threads every so often.  Best regards, Sam"
470441,lew,2010-05-28 09:49:00,12766,"Hey Sam, really good to hear from you my friend, it's been a long time. I wondered where the heck you were but never thought you'd be on the other side of the world  It'd be good to have you posting here again, you always added alot to this board !!"
468284,splashhopper,2010-05-21 01:59:00,2931,Where is RichB and his great reports?    Who else is MIA on OFC ?
468285,splashhopper,2010-05-21 02:00:00,2931,What about CCMT ?
468348,Tarzan's Jane,2010-05-21 10:55:00,1183,"What's his face....you know......darn, he likes to hunt and enjoys racing, is a Newfie, a grandpa, first name is Brian.  It just came to me....Misfish!  He taught me to look at men's shoes."
468361,lew,2010-05-21 11:59:00,12766,People come and go from these boards all the time for many different reasons and I couldn't even guess how many great members we've lost from OFC over the years.  Some leave quietly and just slip out the back door while others make a big deal of it and write long rambling good-byes.  Some come back after awhile and others are never heard from again.  Sad to see some leave and good to be rid of others.
468585,splashhopper,2010-05-22 00:21:00,2931,How about Holdfast and Spike>  Haven't heard from him lately either?
468591,PERCHER,2010-05-22 00:34:00,787,How true Lew
468596,buckster,2010-05-22 00:48:00,530,  Very well put!
468611,Cudz,2010-05-22 01:44:00,2652,What about GCD?  Have I missed a post regarding his whereabouts?
468612,Cudz,2010-05-22 01:45:00,2652,Misfish is still here.  His new handle is BrianB
468614,solopaddler,2010-05-22 01:48:00,8605,I know what's up with most of the guys except Snag.  I miss that guys reports!
468615,Tybo,2010-05-22 01:50:00,1373,"There still the ones that are here, But don't Say to much any more."
468616,misfish,2010-05-22 01:57:00,29133,"  Rat,,,,,"
468622,Cudz,2010-05-22 02:24:00,2652,"Damn, Sorry I blew your cover."
468631,Rattletrap2,2010-05-22 03:34:00,1652,"Strange, I was thinking the very sam thing this morning. I wondered where CCMT and Bly had got to. I figured something was up, but must have missed it. If you are out there guys, chime in every once in a while!  As for GCD, I understand he is on Sabbatical? Hope to see him back here soon....even if he is a crap disturber! LOL"
468632,Mykester,2010-05-22 03:49:00,241,"Jim... Only the real, long term members knew who he was."
468657,wormdunker,2010-05-22 12:13:00,1711,I'm still here!!  I don't post often but enjoy all the great reading on this site.  Thanx to the contributors!!
468670,Terry,2010-05-22 13:34:00,14456,what ever happened to pickeral paul  come to think of it  what ever happened to Clampett
468678,snoil,2010-05-22 14:07:00,139,Photoz?
468679,Roy,2010-05-22 14:11:00,13728, Steve was on here last night at 8:41.....and I really hope his health is better.
468732,JohnF,2010-05-22 20:07:00,3494, Jeez. If he was undercover he's the world's worst spy.  JF
468825,ehg,2010-05-23 11:50:00,2666," HaHa, PP/Clampett was the same guy as you probably know.  About 5 yrs. ago when you received an e-mail notification of a PM, someone queried me about fishing location at that time. The e-mail address was [emailÂ protected]. That guy still posts occasionally."
468831,fishing n autograph,2010-05-23 12:12:00,2540,I'm still here... But I don't think anyone was looking for me lol
468833,lew,2010-05-23 12:22:00,12766, We just assumed your were still sitting in Timmies
468835,fishing n autograph,2010-05-23 12:29:00,2540,Hahaha  Could be sitting beside the bbq getting ready for a nap with the Vaughan hose jockeys lol!!!
468836,fishing n autograph,2010-05-23 12:29:00,2540,Actually I haven't left the drive thru hahaha
