470077,irishfield,2010-05-27 02:33:00,26272,Shouldn't you be at camp or sumptin...
470156,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-27 14:14:00,932,"Wow is right . . . the ramifications from this are unimaginable.  God only knows what this will do to the global climate, keeping in mind that this thing isn't even close to plugged yet."
470165,cityfisher,2010-05-27 14:32:00,959,really sad....damn humans
470169,Chugger,2010-05-27 14:38:00,109,There are early reports coming out that the latest method they've tried to fix the problem has worked...BP is quiet so far.  Here's hoping they've donel it.
470187,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-27 15:31:00,932," Yeah, this needs to stop now.  Hopefully this is a Giant Albatross that big oil can't get away from resulting in higher safety measures BEFORE holes are drilled.  Have marine biologists even began to guestimate on how long this is going to take to clean up and cleanse itself?"
470196,Chugger,2010-05-27 15:47:00,109,"There's no real estimate on damage yet, but it won't be good.  On the flip side, BP's stock is very cheap and I'd be a buyer on takeover speculation alone!"
470213,Nemo,2010-05-27 16:45:00,727,Here are satellite images of the slick from space. Pretty devastating.  http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/event.php?id=43733  
470219,ctranter,2010-05-27 16:56:00,543,The spill area looks to be about the same size as lake Ontario
470221,cityfisher,2010-05-27 16:57:00,959,looks  like it MIGHT be capped. too bad the damage is already done
