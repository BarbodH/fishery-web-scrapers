265909,magicfingers,2008-11-09 21:28:00,37,"I dont own a new one but i do have a 2yr old king.Alls i can say is i love it. I have had islanders,ravens and a loomis.In my mind nothing compares  just my 2 cents  magic"
265928,solopaddler,2008-11-09 22:14:00,8605,"I've been running one of the new 5"" models all fall. Nice reel, worth aquiring if you prefer a 5"" reel which I do but it's not my favourite reel. I've had some minor problems with the clicker spring popping off but nothing that would disuade me from purchasing one."
265948,mark02,2008-11-09 22:58:00,27,Hi Solo.  I'm interested in knowing what is your favourite centrepin reel?  I've been reading your posts over the years and you're a very accomplished steelheader.  Your thoughts ...
265984,solopaddler,2008-11-09 23:53:00,8605," I find it hard to fish with anything less than a 5"" reel anymore which limits my options. That said of the 5"" reels I do own the top 3 would be  1.fully ported Mykiss, 2. 5"" Angling Specialties and 3. Kingpin  The Mykiss's startup is the best and it's incredibly light. Problem is they're somewhat hard to find...  I've got another custom 5"" reel currently on the way. Guy in Ohio made a small batch of 30 and the spec's seem pretty darn good so I'm cautiously optimistic it'll be a good one."
266024,buckster,2008-11-10 01:05:00,530,"Ive got a 5"" Angling Specialties and a kingpin.  They are both great pins.  The Angling spec is my fav but its also  more expensive than the kingpin. For the money the kingpin is great!"
266031,ironstone74,2008-11-10 01:15:00,201," This is slightly off topic, but Solo, why do you prefer 5"" centerpins to others???  The only cp I have used is my Islander which is 4.5"" and I am curious the difference in diameter makes in performance and weight.  Thanks Mike,  Paul"
266090,MJL,2008-11-10 03:57:00,2427," A 5"" diameter reel will generally retrieve more line per rotation of the spool than a 4"" or 4.5"" reel.  Good for catching up with fast running steel at the end of the line."
266098,jdmls,2008-11-10 04:50:00,575,"Fell in love with the Series 1 fully ported the first time I picked it up ..... Awesome reel, tolerance is golden and the startup is unbelievable for a  5"" ,  well 4 7/8"" but close enough..... There are very few,  if any 5"" reels that are as light as the new Series 1 ... Now if mine would just hurry up and get here from the UK , already !!!"
266200,kemper,2008-11-10 17:06:00,2232,"  Got out this weekend with Dave, he was talking about the Kingpin and from what I heard it seems like a sweet rig"
266266,silvio,2008-11-10 22:26:00,433,Daves will be very exotic  . I also picked up a kingpin not the 5 inch (not sure what size). It was sweet all second everything Dave said!!
