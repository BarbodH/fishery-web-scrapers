266484,cityfisher,2008-11-11 21:41:00,959,Congrats Great Buck !
266528,highdrifter,2008-11-11 23:30:00,2534,Very noice!!  Glad you retrieved him..  Must have been a very long night!  thanks for the report.  HD
266559,hammercarp,2008-11-12 00:37:00,964,That is a dandy. Congradulations.
266562,rickster,2008-11-12 00:44:00,495,Thanks all  Now the only decision is jerky? pepperettes? sausage? steaks? burger?  Or (and i am leaning this way)---all of the above
266588,huntervasili,2008-11-12 02:01:00,1604,"Nice buck, congratulations. All of the above is always a nice choice. I almost always make most meat (excluding tenderloins, Backstrap etc) into hamburger and a few roasts, and if time allows will get a couple of salamis made from it. Jerky, and sausage meat can be made at you're leisure from the ground meat or roasts after and if you decide you want it. Enjoy the deer, only a matter of time until I get to attempt again at one."
266614,cram,2008-11-12 02:47:00,1733,"a dumb question, but in the first pics...is he eating planted food?  Do hunters bait for deer? (i know nothing about hunting)"
266617,irishfield,2008-11-12 02:49:00,26272, Yes.. the ones around here keep the local orchards in business.
266621,jdmls,2008-11-12 02:57:00,575,Good to hear all went smooth the next morning..... Beauty Buck !!
266623,Mattones,2008-11-12 03:02:00,587,Very nice buck! congrads!
266634,rickster,2008-11-12 03:39:00,495, Thanks man I will post some pics of the hanging and skinning tomorrow. Too busy celebrating right now     Wooohooooo
266321,rickster,2008-11-11 01:13:00,495,Well fifteen minutes before legal hunting was ending he finally walked out for me. I am sure I made a good shot but with light going fast I decided to leave him for the night and go look for him in the morning. Not the biggest one I had trail cam pics of but he is a nice buck none the less here is a couple pics of him off my trail cam        Will post some pics tomorrow
266324,irishfield,2008-11-11 01:18:00,26272,Hope the wolves don't eat him for you tonight !
266325,Leecher,2008-11-11 01:19:00,7832,"rickster, when you shot it, did you notice the animal doing a funny move? were you able to locate any blood trail from the location you shot him?  Hope you find it cause this is a trophy buck  Jacques"
266329,rickster,2008-11-11 01:33:00,495,It looked like a good hit and when it ran off its tail was down(always a good sign) there was good blood where he was standing when i shot him but I always like to leave them for about an hour before going to look for them. supposed to get down to about minus 9 tonight so he will be ok til the morning  Didn't what to risk going in too early and jumping him and having him run deeper in the bush. The area he headed to is not far from a huge muskeg swamp and I don't really want to drag him out of that mess.
266331,bucktail,2008-11-11 01:36:00,1857,Good choice in waiting.... Good luck man!
266332,buckster,2008-11-11 01:36:00,530,Good move rickster....... Hope u find him in the morning....... I usually wait at least half hour
266333,Leecher,2008-11-11 01:40:00,7832,"Sounds like you had a good shot into him, tail down, a real good sign  Hope you get searching as soon as you can at sunrise and wish you the best of luck Looking forward to hearing back from ya Jacques"
266337,Gerritt,2008-11-11 01:51:00,6129,"forgive my ignorance.. I ask for my own education and in no way am I slamming you, but I have a couple questions..  Dont you have to place your tag on the animal as soon as it is down?  Will the guts not spoil the meat overnight?  what about other carnivores eating the carcass at night??  thanks for the info!  G"
266341,edmichit,2008-11-11 02:06:00,145,"Please get more pictures, a true trophy whitetail. Hard to tell, but looks to be 10 pts?"
266346,Leecher,2008-11-11 02:20:00,7832," G, for your first question, yes the tag must be affixed on the animal as soon as it's shot down, if the animal stays put.  Second, the guts will not spoil the meat unless it overheats, must be gutted as soon as possible Third, the only canivores that I would worry is the wolfes, coyotes and ravens / crows  Temps are dipping into the minus..... don't have to worry about the meat being spoiled. Jacques"
266348,rickster,2008-11-11 02:31:00,495,  Gerritt  The regs state that the tag must be attached immediately after the kill and at the kill site.  But if the animal is not dead yet and I spook him when trying to find him I may never see him.  The tag will be on him the minute I find him in the morning. With temps around minus 9 here tonight the meat should be fine.  I am just hoping nothing finds him tonight.  I haven't seen many wolves and coyotes the past couple years and have not seen any tracks in the last week or so since we got our first snow.  Keeping my fingers crossed though
266351,Mattones,2008-11-11 02:35:00,587,Now thats a nice buck! Congrads! hope you find the big guy tomorrow! Care to take me out hunnting! haha
266357,oxcowboy,2008-11-11 02:57:00,544,"thats a really nice deer, hope ya get him n the morn.  gonna go for a doe or better yet a buck in tomorow, 1st time out in a while, shot the bow a little this evening, everything looks to be good.    best of luck to all the guys going out in the morning.  jason"
266360,waterwolf,2008-11-11 03:08:00,556,"excellent call on this one . a pushed deer can run for hours , making a recovery almost impossible in poor light . let him find a quiet place to expire close by ,, undisturbed ,,is definitely the choice way to go. great deer .  confidence is a good friend . you'll find him."
266361,BUSTER,2008-11-11 03:08:00,1336,nice buck . looking forward to pics tommorow  .we shot a moose opening morn and couldnt find it...good luck
266401,Gerritt,2008-11-11 17:13:00,6129,thanks for the explanation guys!
266422,rickster,2008-11-11 18:33:00,495,Well I went out this morning at first light and there he was. Didn't go more than thirty yards into the bush and dropped among some cedars. Called my brother and he came over with his atv and we pulled it out into the edge of the field for some pics and the always cold job of gutting.  Here he is ..not the widest buck I have shot but he is the tallest and heaviest     
266430,Clampet,2008-11-11 18:49:00,1947,"Nice Venison! Now, fer goodness sakes put that tag on 'im afore you get Gerritt after you again!"
266431,rickster,2008-11-11 18:51:00,495,LOL    Don't worry he is tagged and hanging in the garage
266451,Leecher,2008-11-11 20:12:00,7832,Congratulation rickster  That is a beautiful buck.... Good job on findind it this morning Leechman
