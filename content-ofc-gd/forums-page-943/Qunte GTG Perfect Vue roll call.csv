257901,LeXXington,2008-10-13 02:06:00,1928," Yeap we are in the Vue, now if I could only remember the details.."
257912,Mike the Pike,2008-10-13 02:43:00,3421,Well my friend Kenny was in the T.O area so he dropped by Perfectvue on the way home took some decent pics .  It looks like alot of the docs were taken out of the water due to low water levels one main doc remains.  The launch is mostly sandy however there is another launch down the road that costs $2 you put your $$$ in a little box the honour system. I will see when I get there of course I have relatives and friends with 4 X 4 's  Kenny did not notice any BBQ's so I will phone Joann to find out if not I guess GlennK and I will be brininging the camping BBQ's.  I will also find out how much vacancy is available.  Looking forward to meeting so many new members .MTP

265424,Headhunter,2008-11-07 13:35:00,5703,"TED!!! My Brother from another Mother!!!!! Last year, before the the GTG, Ted connected with me regarding the trip. We had room for one in our cottage, and invited Ted... none of us in our cottage had ever met Ted before! He showed up mid after on the Friday, quick introductions and immediately put a lovely pork roast in the oven, just so we could have something ""to nibble on"" during our stay! Needless to say we hit it off immediately and after sharing a few pops, we found out that we have many similar life experiences! He's like the brother I didn't know I had! Lookin forward to seeing yah again Ted! Hopefully this year we'll spank those Pickereyes! HH"
