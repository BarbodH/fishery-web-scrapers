266102,jdmls,2008-11-10 05:32:00,575,"After yesterday's hard work with little return, I was pretty sluggish gettin out of bed this morning. I Walked a creek out east with Kemper for a few hours yesterday, but the water was rediculously low even with the rain from Friday, so we pretty much cut our losses and called it a day by mid morning ... Good times talking and walking new sections of the creek, anyway. We will get at em soon with a little rain in the near future.  With everything being so low out east , We decided to change it up from the usual tribs and try one that we tend to neglect , due to it being so far from home   ...Well I am glad we did !!!  We were down at the creek for first light, only to find the pool we trecked 30 minutes for was untouched !!  Water was gin clear but a good section of the pool had enough depth to give the fish a place to sulk...  Knowing the water was going to be extremely clear I didn't bother tying any roe bags for this outing. First drift with my cured single , and POW... Float gets sucked down not even 1/4 of the way down the pool.... I new thing were  about to get ugly, LOL !!  First beauty hen of the morning   Followed by this one not even 2 drifts later   After that it was one after another for a good 3 hours....We lost 2 or 3 brutes that were into double digits. I was cursing my St.Croix all morning, LOL ....  Here's SILVIO breaking in his new IMX he just picked up ....Sweeeet stick   First fish on his new rod...the smile says it all       Here's Berge puttin the boots to this chunky male with the SAGE ..... ""Engage the drag"" , LOL               The IMX that made me hate my St. Croix, LOL ..... Can't wait to pick one up             BLOOPER !!! Berge , you kill me !!!          What a day Boys... Until next week !!!"

266109,silvio,2008-11-10 06:17:00,433,  In this pic I am saying berge give me MY fish lol good hands Berge unlike me you dont let go lol.  And a prime example of how to make a fish look deformed lol Berge you kill me lol good times bud.   Good job boys. I know a few of you distinguish the background lets keep it hush. I got tons more pics but the background is super recognizable so I am not going to post them. We lost at least 4 fish over 10 all never forget my tug of war with ms.skyhigh tail walking bulldogging steel.  Enjoy P.S I sleep with my IMX and I am not scared to hide it lol one of the best rods.
