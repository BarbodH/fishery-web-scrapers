265114,ketchenany,2008-11-06 14:36:00,3229,I'm doing a tourisim publication for Ontario Tourisim and was wondering if there is a specific ICE FISHING  board for Ontario. We get great reports here but I'm looking for something more detailed.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry I have no prizes to give like Dave.
265116,Beans,2008-11-06 14:54:00,3339,"Unfortunately most websites are area specific...Lake Simcoe, Scugog, Cook's Bay Bay of Quinte etc.  Try doing a ""Google"" search..."
265134,DRIFTER_016,2008-11-06 16:05:00,10439,The biggest and best on the net!!! There is an Ontario Forum.  Ice Shanty

265150,jdmls,2008-11-06 18:05:00,575,www.lakesimcoemessageboard.com   gets out of hand once the hardwater is game .... The lake scugog on was happening last year throughout the winter as well.
265159,Disspatcher,2008-11-06 18:46:00,73,www.gofishont.com is a good one.. nice peeps there too.
265168,Roy,2008-11-06 19:24:00,13728," Especially since you're a mod there eh? I don't see anything wrong with folks helping other folks by directing them to something that could be helpful to them. But I do see something fundamentally wrong with fishing for members on someone elses' site. And no, I don't think it's just me."

265203,douG,2008-11-06 21:12:00,2693,"Roy, I read all sorts of fishing message boards.  I don't think that if I visit gofishont that I will read this board any less.  It's not a zero sum game, is it?"
265204,fishfarmer2,2008-11-06 21:17:00,76,Sorry i heard there isent going to be no ice this year thats what the farmers say ?? Please dont take this serious right aaaa

265440,Ranger22,2008-11-07 15:11:00,18,www.Icefishing247.com has an Ontario specific section on it's site thats how i found out about this site.
265446,tip-up,2008-11-07 15:45:00,94," Give me a break Roy  I suggest checking out IceShanty.com as well. All the info you will ever need regarding the sport of ice fishing, there are also a lot of fisherman from Ontario. Another month or so the forum should be really bumping.  Andrew"
265453,JorgeCarlos,2008-11-07 16:07:00,109,www.cooksbayfishingboard.com   great place and good info on Simcoe hard water fishing.  Jorge
265454,limeyangler,2008-11-07 16:17:00,5204,Iceshanty is a great site.
266116,Disspatcher,2008-11-10 11:59:00,73,"Sorry if I offended you Roy. I was just responding to a question asked. How many times have you seen me mention the other board here?.  Only when asked ..IF I have at all.....I have been a member here for 2 years or so far and if its ok, Id like to continue.  Just because I help those guys out, doesnt mean I dont enjoy frequenting other boards either. (3 or 4 others as a matter of fact)  I also mentioned ""nice people there too....too meaning, much like this board...good people...)  Anyway, sorry if i offened anyone.   Regards; Disspatcher"
266118,Roy,2008-11-10 12:04:00,13728,No worries Disspatcher......all's cool.
266139,DT10Sam,2008-11-10 13:43:00,480,"I don't have a forum on my site however, I do post what happens on the Bay of Quinte once the ice fishing starts up. Most of my info is where the fish are caught and where to stay away from due to poor ice conditions etc.  Regards, Sam"
