Really felt like steelheading, heck I even had corn bags tied up. Every logjam had 4 or 5 sitting behind it but they would spook if I got anywhere close enough to make a drift. Bout halfway on my journey I hooked one in a narrows probably 6lbs and my hook & float came flying back at me. This was a good time to realize I busted the point off my hook at some time earlier. Didn't hook another fish (but saw TONS) until the very other end of the river where I hooked a two pounder and I couldn't even keep HIM hooked as he darted into a bush instantly.  0 / 2 on CARP sheesh just a bad day. Was nice to walk the whole town of Simcoe again though. There really are some beautiful stretches of river there."

266193,Marko,2008-11-10 16:48:00,854,"Carping on a light gear is just awesome. At least you managed to hook into some. I didnt think they would put up much of a fight this late in a year, last few i hooked didnt really."
266514,Rich,2008-11-11 23:08:00,3927,"I find the biggest ones fight like logs this time of year, yet the small ones under 5lbs seem to still fight like crazy. Weird!"
266561,hammercarp,2008-11-12 00:42:00,964,Sounds like you had a nice day anyway.
