265728,Leecher,2008-11-09 04:23:00,7832,"Hello everyone, Been a while since I last posted a report and let me tell you, I manage to bag my personal best this season. Got up there Oct 31st and this is the view from the camp that greeted us....  What a beautiful place    and the view of the camp    This would be our home base for the next 8 days.... we strarted right away scouting our hunting area and did not look too promissing    no tracks to be found.  Deer was not moving but on Sunday afternoon, found some fresh tracks.  Got our hopes up     Deer was in the pre-rut.  Came Monday, my brother missed a buck that came within 15' of him, just could not shoot it  because the deer saw him and scoot out of there in a hurry  On Tuesday, had something behind my tree stand that sounded like a doe but could not positively identify and that was it......  Got me all pumped up  Managed a couple of pics of my tree stand when I got there      Wednesday morning was the same except , at around 10:15am, this huge buck decided to hit the road and walk towards me     Got the blood flowing for a while until it got within 60 yards from me.  Took aim and release the trigger...... BANG..... Dropped him right in it's tracks    Sorry for the blood on the neck but it's where I shot it.    A couple of shots with me and again, sorry for the blood      Back at camp, another shot of my PB    It weighted 152Lbs empty,  14 1/4"" in length in between the main beams.  8 Points..... Got him on the grunt call.  Hope you enjoy Leechman"

Did that too but too much snoring once I hit the pillow   Thanks Rob.... It was a blast out there   Thanks Steve..... don't know what the site changed to not being able to display the pics but did get a Photobucket account and much easier now.   Very sorry for not keeping the buck tail for ya      Will have to make it a must next time I get out there and bag one   Thanks Glen,  glad to be back and it sure will be good table fare for the next little while   Thanks bigugli.... much appreciated"

Thanks misfish.... that was the only shot I could take from that bucks position.... thank god I went to the range on Friday to try out the riffle before the hunt   Thanks Cliff.... it sure took / felt a long time for the buck to reach the 50-60 yards range.... just thank my lucky stars he gave me this opportunity   Thanks Roy.... the minute we arrived is when I started to decompress from the city stress and to be able to bag a PB was bonus   Thanks tibbs!   Thanks limeyangler!   Thanks Streamerguy.... Did not bring any gear because season is closed up there and plus it would not fit into the trcuk   Thanks Bernie!
