265770,solopaddler,2008-11-09 14:36:00,8605,"So, last Thursday night my buddy Fergie calls me to say he can't make it Fri/Sat. We had plans to head to Ohio to meet up with a friend of mine who lives down there for 2 days of fishing. Looong drive when you're alone, so I decided against going. Still, I had 2 free days. The kids were being dropped off at my sister's place for a sleepover and Joanne had things planned for both days herself. Couldn't possibly let this opportunity go to waste  .  Friday morning I started locally at Port D. The browns had been hitting pretty good earlier in the week so I thought why not? After arriving at the pier I noticed a familiar looking boat drifting in the current. Turned out to be a couple buddies of mine and they were more than happy to welcome me aboard. Excellent! I've got no pic's to show you mainly 'cause I didn't catch anything  . That's the way she goes sometimes! While I was with them the other boys caught a couple of browns and 1 lake trout though, but it certainly wasn't fast and furious. I did have a fat female brown on and right up to the side of the boat before the hook pulled free.  Around 11am I said my goodbyes and left the boys drifting. I shot home, packed the car and hit the hwy north.  Suddenly I had an urge to fish the Saugeen  . I figured it would be good as I'd heard a couple of reports that the water was up, in prime shape and the fish were in. The only concern was rain. I drove through a literal monsoon approaching Southampton and it never stopped from that point on. I arrived at 4:30pm so I didn't have much time to waste. I quickly donned my waders and headed to the dam. Not a spot I normally bother with, but time was of the essence..  The river was up, slightly off coloured and just rippin'. In the rainy, murky gloom I saw 3 guys with fish on at the same time, rods dancing and bucking as they struggled to follow these fresh powerhouse fish downstream. I managed to squeeze into a spot and with about 30 mins of light left my float shot under and I was suddenly attached to a bolt of lightning. The fish, a good one, shot through the tailout and sped downriver through another riffle before I could blink. Stumbling after it as best I could the fish made one wild leap and spit the hook... Ah well... I snapped a quick pic of the pool before the rain and approaching darkness drove me from the river:    Now I had decision to make, what to do? The 'geen is one of my favourite rivers, but with all the rain I was afraid Saturday might be a write off. Rather than potentially be faced with blown conditions I decided to head east to Georgian Bay. Those rivers (the smaller ones at least) would be a much safer bet in my experience...  Pulled into town around 8pm, checked into a motel, wolfed down some fast food and a beer and passed out.  The next morning I arrived at the mouth of the river in darkness. As best I could tell the water was up and off coloured but definitely fishable. Already both banks were lined with guys fishing with small glowsticks on their floats. I walked over to the east side and found a nice flat rock to stand on..  Now this is cool  . It was really still too dark to see my float, but I couldn't resist lobbing a cast out anyway. I threw it out there blindly, and after about 10 seconds I feel this huge tug on my line. I thought it was one of guys across from me that I was entangled with. Great start I thought.. I slowly pull back (no hook set) and a fish erupted right in front of me apparantly attached to the end of my line. Great start indeed  .    Ended up doing quite well. Without getting into numbers it was by far the best day I've had up there in a while.  Didn't get a ton of pic's, but I did get a few:              I just bought a smoker last week and decided that I'd keep a couple of these chrome beauties to try out. Near the end of the day I dispatched a couple and filleted them up. Check out the meat, yum!    Fantastic couple of days even being solo!  Cheers,  Mike"

265792,ccmtcanada,2008-11-09 15:43:00,7971,Great stuff Mike!  The places you fish are amazing compared to the little creeks I head to.  Went out yesterday morning...only managed a few small shakers.  Then the winds kicked up so much my float would almost peg me in the head after each cast...LOL.
265802,Beats,2008-11-09 16:12:00,543,Nice report there.  Must have put some miles on the car this weekend..   I'm surprised there wasn't more on the Saugeen at that spot.
265805,solopaddler,2008-11-09 16:28:00,8605," Well I only used it at the Saugeen, it's a big water stick as you know, so can't really say. Incredible power for such a thin blank that's for sure...  I'll give you the definitive rundown after the Michigan trip this week."
265814,tibbs,2008-11-09 16:41:00,650,Nice job!  Sounds like you had a fantastic time!

265978,GbayGiant,2008-11-09 23:43:00,1780,"Very nice Mike all the driving and solo trip payed off. Never leave home without a glow stick.  I miss river fishing bows it's been a while, but I use to be a night hawk when everyone was leaving I was just showing up with a pocket full of glow sticks and they hit all night long from dusk till dawn."

266111,solopaddler,2008-11-10 10:51:00,8605," Sadly, it was."
