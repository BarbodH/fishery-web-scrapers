265942,Mike the Pike,2008-11-09 22:49:00,3421,Shawn is right boat traffic can be a huge factor.I actually like the days when the weather is crap on the weekend because the boat traffic is minimal.  Each yr I now reserve 2 days before the weekend alot less traffic.  Oh and BTW Fishin Devil's other boat is a submarine with fish stun missiles
