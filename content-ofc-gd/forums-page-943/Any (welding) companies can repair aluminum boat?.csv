265866,Dondorfish,2008-11-09 19:43:00,1000,The best person to talk to is Wayne ( Irishfield ) - best on the board at aluminum info.  Don  
265869,misfish,2008-11-09 19:48:00,29133,OHHHHHHHHH WAYNE. Yer up.LOL
265870,irishfield,2008-11-09 19:54:00,26272,Cheques are in the mail guys.....  Linweir... can you get a picture of the damage... inside and outside?
265893,linweir,2008-11-09 20:50:00,202,Irishfield It's on outside. Boat bumped dock during a very windy night. Two huge nails on dock broke a piece of aluminum. Foam can be seen. Do you have email address? I can ask him to give a pic?  Thx for your help.
265910,irishfield,2008-11-09 21:29:00,26272,"Linweir.. if it's not accessible from the inside (ie foam showing) then you can't weld it (or you'll burn the boat up) and you can't solid rivet a patch either. I should have the required blind ""tank"" rivets though to make a leakproof seal and I do have the aluminum for sure.  I'll send you my email in a PM and you can get your buddy to email me from there with some pictures."
