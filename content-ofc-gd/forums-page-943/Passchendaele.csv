I would urge you all to see this before Nov 11, as it will give you a tiny glimpse of what that time was like. One thing that struck me was the fact that the entire audience remained in their seats in complete respectful silence as the credits rolled. That shows, in my opinion, just how powerful this movie is. Do take the time to see it!, and wear your poppies proudly."

My grandfather fought in the trenches in France with the British Army in WW1 and the stories he used to tell me were beyond belief and what those men went through was nothing short of horrendous.  The 2 big wars are ancient history to many people now and I think most kids have no clue about them, specially WW1, so hopefully this movie will give them at least a small idea of what it was all about.  From what I was told 1st hand from my grandfather though, I don't think any movie actor could portray the horror of what actually went on in those hell holes."

265763,bigugli,2008-11-09 13:36:00,6138,"My uncle Bob was with the horse arty in WW I. Fought the whole 5 years in France. Gassed twice, was at Ypres to hold the line when the French broke ranks to escape that big first gas attack. Drove their horses right into the gas cloud and kept their position til help arrived. They survived the gas by pissing on a piece of cloth and tying it over their face. He rarely talked about it. When he did, you could see in his face the emotions welling up. As if he was reliving another horrible moment. I can't imagine how much it hurt just to remember. He never went to the Legion for weepers, and would never leave the house on the 11th. I and a couple of cousins have been fortunate to have never seen combat, but I have lost friends in peacetime. I can understand why he did not want to remember. The faces of friends lost frozen in memory. Being one of the few original old sweats to actually survive pained him.  ...""At the going down of the sun and in the morning WE SHALL REMEMBER THEM"""
