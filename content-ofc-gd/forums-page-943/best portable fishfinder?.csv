Mine is crapped out and i need to buy a new one....the two i've owned are quite dated (portable ~7 yrs old, the one in my boat>10) so am not that familiar with how much better the new features are......suggestions?"

266293,PERCHER,2008-11-11 00:13:00,787,For ice fishing nothing compares to a good flasher.Such as a Vexlar. Just my 2 cents. Dan

266352,cram,2008-11-11 02:41:00,1733, Curious -- why???  Educate me.
266353,cram,2008-11-11 02:43:00,1733, Have heard that before.  Thing is i'll also use this on a canoe for back-lake canoe trips etc..  Curious though -- why is a flasher best for ice fishing?

Bay) and I wonder if this is the year it will konk out. And it performs without a hitch. When it finally dies, I'm buying another Eagle. Couldn't be happier with it."
266368,tschirk,2008-11-11 03:37:00,261,Lowrance x67c ice machine...great battery life & fast flasher. I use it as my bow mounted FF during summer.
266420,DANIMAL,2008-11-11 18:25:00,215,  It displayes in exact real time. So it shows how a fish reacts to how you present your bait with no hesitation. this can be a big advantage when the bite is tough.
266421,limeyangler,2008-11-11 18:33:00,5204,"Lowrance X67C is awesome! ok....its the only type i've used, but i have seen flashers in use on the ice....i much prefer the graph mode (the same mode you see when i use it on the boat in the summer) and for those who prefer, it has an LCD flasher mode too....not quite as good as an actual flasher iv'e heard...but it works."
266509,Rich,2008-11-11 23:01:00,3927,I've had a Humminbird 100SX for 10 years. It was my 12th birthday present. It still works. Though I think I will upgrade this winter to one that doesn't take two of the huge lantern batteries.
