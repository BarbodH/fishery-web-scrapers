Well it was a slow moring only one crappie and no bass. So i get a call from keith and he wants to come out and fish so i met him at the lanch and we headed out to get some crappies. The wind was blowing us all over and fianlly i broke out the ancher on a over hangin tree and it was non stop crappie! We put back a lot of small ones and kept a few for shore lunch!
