Decided to move out into deeper water and lower my trolling speed to 3mph.....I'm glad I did  Was able to have some fun with this healthy 45"" x 20"" gal....nice fall fatty for sure!!...a quick pic and off she went back into the river!!  Gotta luv fall fishing!  Now, gotta get back to raking leaves again....  "
