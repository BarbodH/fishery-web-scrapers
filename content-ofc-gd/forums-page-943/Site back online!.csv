It all seems to be fine now, but running a bit slow as all the servers come back online and the load sharing starts to kick in. Hopefully you used the time wisely...raked the leaves or talked to your spouse or sumthin."

For my own part I wuz way too occupied with getting my new real estate office up and running to fritter away the day talking to a bunch of fish-obsessed layabouts. I feel good about that - and really really lucky cuz it didn't happen on almost any other day of the year when I woulda been jonesing for a fix (of the OFC variety).  Just don't let it happen again. I hate when my wife sees me whispering sweet nothings to my baitcaster - for want of a better way to pass time.  JF"
