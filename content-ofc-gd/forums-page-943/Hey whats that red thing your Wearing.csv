266012,Beats,2008-11-10 00:42:00,543,"That first medal looks fantastic.  However, it's the Boer war, not ""boar"".  You certainly have a family history of military service.  Good to see you have kept the medals in such great shape."
266060,holdfast,2008-11-10 02:16:00,1813,Thanks on the spelling mistake.
266086,HTHM,2008-11-10 03:47:00,4082,"You are being a little too humble, show us some pics of your service medals."
266101,bigugli,2008-11-10 05:26:00,6138,"I believe the second set of medals belongs to Holdfast. The 3 campaign medals for peacekeeping are a hint.  Quite an appropriate moniker for someone who would stand to and ""holdfast"" the line for 25 years."
266112,HTHM,2008-11-10 11:05:00,4082,Brains never were my strong suit
266127,bigugli,2008-11-10 12:55:00,6138,"Don't feel bad. Most people wouldn't know.  My family serves and, I hope, will always serve.  There are three different types of military medal. 1)  campaign medals or stars which identify the military campaigns one was involved with. If you look at the bars on the Boer War medal, it has  added distinctions. 2) Battle honours which shows that, not only was the recipient in S. Africa for the campaign, he actually fought at certain major actions. 3) Then there are ""gongs"". These are the medals you read about in the news. These are the ones given out for distinct acts, leadership, bravery or sacrifice. The greatest distinction is the Victoria Cross, easily recognized  by the solid burgundy/maroon ribbon and the simple inscription ""For Valor"" I almost forgot to mention that the VC is such an esteemed award that the wearer of such an honour customarily receive a salute. Even if that means a general having to salute a lowly private. It is recognition of the honour and the recipients selfless sacrifice."
