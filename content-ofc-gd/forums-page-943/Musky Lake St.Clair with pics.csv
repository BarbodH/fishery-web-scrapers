265617,muskyhunter5150,2008-11-08 16:03:00,64,Nice muskies! I love how the lake st clair musky look. alot different from the kawartha fish for sure.
265618,irishfield,2008-11-08 16:03:00,26272,Great stuff Moemoe !!
265624,limeyangler,2008-11-08 16:41:00,5204,Awesome Moemoe.  Never caught a musky myself...wish i could though...lol.  That downrigger shot is fantastic.   Thanks for sharing.
265644,moemoe,2008-11-08 19:51:00,352,"Unsure of exactly how long the last fish was, I brought an old tape measure with, but it got stuck at 40""! and i discovered using a metal tape measure in the water is not that easy....i should have taken a pic of the other side of that fish, as it had one eye and busted jaw....real ugly sucker.....probably why it was so skinny"
265646,moemoe,2008-11-08 19:55:00,352,"One more thing that I want to add, is about some of the pin heads fishing from shore at the thames. one guy I saw caught a low 40's fish and another gent netted the fish for the guy, but the guy doing the netting purposely whips the fish out of the net onto to the gravel, doesn't want to touch the fish while he gets the hooks out and then kicks the fish back over the sidewall and 5 foot drop! If you don't want to touch the fish, don't fish for them!"
265648,johnnyb,2008-11-08 19:57:00,3413,Some people's children!
265695,fishindevil,2008-11-09 00:21:00,6254,Some very nice sized St.Clair muskies guys WTG !!!!  ...nice pics too...cheers
265755,outllaw,2008-11-09 12:41:00,1232,yes moe some folks have no respect. i have even heard stories of folks being threatened and  belittled for calling the mnr on flagrant violations.. the river mentioned is only 1 rod per angler.
265758,Bob Devine,2008-11-09 12:47:00,251,"Good job Moe. I hope to see you on the water soon. I have stayed away from the (zoo) but will make a trip or 2 during the wk days once in a while. Tell the gang I said ""Hi"". "
