266257,danbo,2008-11-10 22:00:00,2646,Good Job! Now a nice Oak Shield/plaque to put it on & you're set!
266258,misfish,2008-11-10 22:05:00,29133,How do you plan on rattling them? LOL  Nice rack. PERFECT.
266259,Mattones,2008-11-10 22:08:00,587,I really don't like saying this to peoples faces but.. Nice rack!   I hope to have mine this year
266261,Rich Clemens,2008-11-10 22:17:00,3131,That is a very well proportioned rack.   What's the spread on that one ?
266264,Leecher,2008-11-10 22:21:00,7832," Thanks Rich.... it was 14"" 1/4 appart from the main beams Check out my report http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=25354 Jacques"
266267,Rich Clemens,2008-11-10 22:27:00,3131,Sweet.   I had tried to view the report when it first came up.  I think that's when there was trouble getting the pics to show up.  Looking great now.     Thanks Jacques ... quite impressive.
266268,Leecher,2008-11-10 22:30:00,7832," Thanks danbo.... planning on choosing a nice plank of wood and roter it so to hang it on   Thanks misfish.... real proud of this trophy   Thanks Matt... Hope you get a beautiful buck..... If you need some pointers, be glad to help out"
266271,wuchikubo,2008-11-10 22:43:00,1114,Very nice.  Another post that's got me thinking I've got to pick up this sport.
266274,danbo,2008-11-10 22:47:00,2646,
266277,Leecher,2008-11-10 22:57:00,7832," Thanks HearingFish.... it's really a beautiful sport and in need a lot of patience not only for shooting it but also figuring out what to do after the animal been shot, registered, tagged and brought back from the hunt.  I just enjoy working on my trophy and extremely happy about the outcome Thanks again"
266279,Leecher,2008-11-10 23:07:00,7832, Thanks again Rich.... Real proud of it
266282,jwl,2008-11-10 23:24:00,1056,"that turned out pretty nice for sure, will look great on the wall.  When I lived up in the Soo and would tag along on a couple moose hunts, some of the guys there would take the head/skull of the moose and hang it up on a tree to let the ravens and such pick the crap out if it and clean it all up to expose thebones, I seen a couple really nice full skull/rack mounts that where dome this way"
266288,Leecher,2008-11-10 23:51:00,7832, Thanks jwl..... It's a lot of work once you chop it off the head and I'm sure that the ravens did a good job at picking the bones.... You should see the grey jay birds going for the pieces of fat once the deer is hung up on the tree  Thanks agian jwl much appreciated
266297,jwl,2008-11-11 00:27:00,1056, ya those Whiskey-Jacks are always on the lookout for an easy meal
266302,Whopper,2008-11-11 00:37:00,2174,"Just an obsevation here Leechman, most people here don't ever bother thanking anyone for a positive comment and you have thanked everyone that has commented. Well Done!  Congrats on your trophy rack!"
266308,Leecher,2008-11-11 00:48:00,7832," Thanks Whopper..... It's rewarding when you get positive comments on such an accomplishment and truly appreciate your positive input..... don't know if you hunt at all but if you do, looking forward to your reports too  Thanks again Jacques"
266311,Greencoachdog,2008-11-11 00:52:00,8163,Well done and beautiful trophy Jacques!!!
266313,Whopper,2008-11-11 00:52:00,2174,Your welcome!  Nah I don't hunt ...I'm dangerous enough with a fishing pole
266315,Leecher,2008-11-11 00:58:00,7832, Thanks Glen.... now got to wait until it's dry to proceed to the next step.... guess by Christmas will have it mounted on the wall   OK but still looking forward to your fishing reports
