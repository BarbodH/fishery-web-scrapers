266237,GBW,2008-11-10 20:49:00,8460,"Hi all.  I was fishing up at the cottage over the weekend when I noticed that the insert on the guide at the tip is missing.  My wife got the rod a few years ago at good old Walmart but I cannot find the bill.  Is there anywhere I can get it replaced or fixed?  I think all the Shakespear rod's have a 5-year warranty too so I'm not sure what to do, thanks.  Geoff"
266241,bassjnkie,2008-11-10 21:08:00,1101,"I went to a local shop got the eye replaced for $6, way cheaper than shipping the rod out. CTC has a tip replacement tip, comes with tip and glue. Oh, ya, instructions.   Daniel"
266242,misfish,2008-11-10 21:09:00,29133,Take it back to wal mart. No questions asked about replacing it.
266336,steverowbotham,2008-11-11 01:50:00,1800,"I wouldnt replace a rod thats a few years old at the store, too much grief.  You can replace the tip for about 6 bucks with a tip repair kit (Canadian Tire, Bass PRo etc.)  Ugly Stiks have a 7 year warranty through the company, costs way more than 6 bucks to ship it out."
266382,GBW,2008-11-11 05:07:00,8460,"Thanks all.   I wish I had your walmart here.  after I found the bill I tried to exchange it I was told ""no, it's after 90 days so it's up to you to chase down the mfg of the product as it's not our warranty"".  I felt like saying something rude but the person on the other side of the counter looked like she knows what an Ugly Stick was/is so I left it at that.  and I'm not talking fishing... I'm still mad (and that was 4 hours ago) after all the non stop money I spend there..."
266383,bigugli,2008-11-11 05:08:00,6138,"I have one of the earlier Uglystiks , and I still have the original pkg card that has the lifetime warranty printed on it."
266385,Raf,2008-11-11 05:42:00,3495,take it to tightlines in pickering.. for 5-6 bucks you will have a new tip.  maybe free if you buy a couple of items.  this may be a good opportunity to upgrade too!
266386,GBW,2008-11-11 05:49:00,8460,"tks, folks.  I have a busy work week so I'll think about it while I go from place to place...  tightlines though, I'll have to look them up, tks."
266458,misfish,2008-11-11 20:26:00,29133,  Never show the bill. LOL    I woud let wally world worry about it.
266469,marine5068,2008-11-11 20:55:00,26,"I would just glue a new tip-top guide on that you can buy at Wally Mart....ha,ha... back there again. The hard part will be cutting off the existing tip-top guide, ouch! At least you didn't pick up the rod from the tip as my buddy did last year with his rod in northern Algonquin Park. Sad to say he only brought one rod with him too, and I HATE lending my expensive rods...LOL."
266501,irishfield,2008-11-11 22:44:00,26272,Why cut it off... just heat it up and it will come off by pulling with pliers......and if you're quick the new one will go on into the melted glue.
