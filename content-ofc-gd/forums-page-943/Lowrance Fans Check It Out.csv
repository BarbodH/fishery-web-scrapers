265522,fishindevil,2008-11-08 00:32:00,6254,"WOW...thats amazing technology thats for sure,man i better start saving up for a new graph in the spring !!!! thanks for sharing that link,i already heard through a local tackle shop that lowrance was comming out with some top secret stuff,and now i know what that is....it looks like humminbird,will have to be back to the drawing board,they are always so far ahead of the competion...cheers"
265525,mbac31,2008-11-08 00:40:00,904,I think they will tell more in like 10 mhours or something.   How do you like those  Gary Parsons and Keith Kavajecz  design rods for trolling. I see that you have been down a couple of times.
265526,Uncle Buck,2008-11-08 00:43:00,1000,"great, they already cost an arm and a leg, i can only imagine how expensive these new ones are gonna be...  look good though..."
265544,DRIFTER_016,2008-11-08 02:43:00,10439,"       Me Likey!!!! Well I was going to get an LCX 113, but now I think I see an even sweeter toy!!!"
265552,irishfield,2008-11-08 03:23:00,26272,LOL Dave... just remember the 113 is not better than the 112 for use in Canada. The 113 just has more built in mapping of USA lakes than the 112.  As for the new one Smalliefisher... where does it stop! LOL  The fish finder part looks neat...but unless someone does some more hydrographic surveys of our Canadian lakes the mapping part is as good as it's going to get already. There are so many errors in the existing charting that it's pointless to upgrade at this point in time if you already have mapping on your unit. Dozen's of depth errors in yesterday's muskie troll alone...with places shown as 20 FOW actually 80 FOW...a few unmarked shoals in the middle of open water....etc
265576,mbac31,2008-11-08 04:35:00,904,Yeah. Takes a while to figure those mistakes out on all the lakes. Just make your own with Map Create software. Takes a long time though. The new ones will be out for this year for great lakes regions so we will be ablt to get that type of Definition. Cant wait.
265638,Billy Bob,2008-11-08 18:16:00,5865,Here's a LOT more info on the new Lowrance units that will be available come 2/09 with prices included. Of course these are US prices and I'm sure they will cost a bit more in Canada as everything else is.  http://www.cascadegps.com/store/home.php?cat=89   Bob
265835,GbayGiant,2008-11-09 17:52:00,1780,"That broadband adapter looks sweet, for $700cnd though ? it will be $300 in 2 years, damn inflation on new technology.   Yep, too many to count even with the best chip, gps is just a start point than it's all sonar, I just mark way-points all along the actual break lines of good musky trolls and go by that. This is why the 3D underwater views don't work either because they just follow the GPS contours and they aren't even close most times, I don't even turn the 3D on ever it's useless."
265840,DRIFTER_016,2008-11-09 18:18:00,10439," I think the new machines include broadband. I could be wrong though, I was once before..........June 10th 1979 I think.  I guess we'll know for sure in about 10 days."
265947,GbayGiant,2008-11-09 22:56:00,1780," The full new units do include it, but theres also seperate new adapter they have for all the older units you can plug in to your transducer at $600us if you want to upgrade your existing finder."
