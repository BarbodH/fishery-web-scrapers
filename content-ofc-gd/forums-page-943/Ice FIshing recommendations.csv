Just wondering if I could get some expert advice on where I should book a 4-6 man hut this year?  I'm hoping to get away for the weekend with the guys, we are willing to drive a max of 4 hours from Barrie for some good fishing.  I figure it's probably wise to book it now.  Target species - Pickeral and Panfish, the odd Lake Trout/Pike would be great too.  The reason why I need your help is that we are hoping to make this an annual event, so I'm hoping we can go to an excellent spot the first year.  Thank you in advance for your help!!  I truly appreciate it."

There's not much biting after dark anyway, we do the cottage on shore routine, nice warm relax, get fuzzy and don't have t hang your appendage out in that crazy cold."

266228,Jay T,2008-11-10 19:48:00,282,"  Yes Rob is ok and will try to get you on fish. I went with him for 5 years and it got worse every year with the fishing. There are many different outfitters with heated crappers and better accommodations IMO.  I will be going up to Nip Jan 16-18 with 9 other guys, going to try a different area of the lake.   Give this a look at there are many to choose from.  http://www.fishinontario.com/icefish.shtml#nipissing"
