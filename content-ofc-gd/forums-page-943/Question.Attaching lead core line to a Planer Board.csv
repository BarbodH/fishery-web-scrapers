266028,PERCHER,2008-11-10 01:11:00,787,I thought this was a lead core thread not one of Mike and his tiller.
266029,Mike the Pike,2008-11-10 01:14:00,3421,Keep it going it seems to get more posts than my fishing reports.  Something tells me Brian is going to ditch the center console shortly
266036,PERCHER,2008-11-10 01:23:00,787,It's o.k Mike I always thought I would be a tiller man until this showed up in my driveway.If it hadn't I would never had swiched either.But now there is no going back only forward 1850 Tyee here we come 
266110,SlowPoke,2008-11-10 09:47:00,2984," That's not in the cards anytime soon Mike! I really like the CC but I have to admit; fishing last weekend with a full windshield, top and heater took the edge off the skunk!"
266140,Headhunter,2008-11-10 13:49:00,5703,"Clipping the lead core to the board is not an issue. If you know anything about core, you know that the lead itself does not provide any of the strength of the line, only it's sinking properties. The plastic sheath surrounding the core is what provides it's strength. There are no issues using core on a board. HH PS... CONSOLE!!!!!!"

265104,Gerritt,2008-11-06 14:11:00,6129,I think Joe (Headhunter) does it all the time Mike
265105,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-06 14:11:00,1362,"I don't believe that it'll damage the line Mike, but you will definately need to double wrap it onto the first release clip to prevent the line from sliding and/or pre-mature releasing"
265107,Uncle Buck,2008-11-06 14:25:00,1000,i wouldn't do it...  not sure of the affect it will have...  what i did was i spliced a 10ft piece of mono in the middle of the 10 color core... then i can run it 5 colors or 10...
265121,Badger Shark,2008-11-06 15:11:00,291,"We do it all the time, no ill effects at all.  And as for the line slipping, try and pick yourself up locking clips for you boards this way your line will not come out until you release it."
265123,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-06 15:15:00,1362," Don, where can I get those locking clips from here locally??....Are they made by Off-Shore as well??"
265124,Headhunter,2008-11-06 15:16:00,5703,"Yup, been using Lead Core on offshore boards with the OR18 release clip (http://www.offshoretackle.com/prelease.htm) for years with NO problems what so ever. Now, if you want to see something really cool with lead core, you should see how I connect my leader to the core! HH Clips have been available at BPS... not cheap at around $18.00 per."
265126,Badger Shark,2008-11-06 15:19:00,291,"Steve we had to drive to Smiths Falls to Bennetts, I have four and I think he had two more left.  Bits and Baits had them but are sold out.  They are a bit pricey but well worth it.  The board will not come off."
265128,Fang,2008-11-06 15:29:00,1330,"I run the OR18 with 18# lead core. The pull on the board keeps the leadcore out of the water at all times from rod to board. Works very well  each color of 18"" gives me about 8ft depth of water with a 50ft flouro leader. I like to run the shallow minnow baits like rapalas and reefrunners with the lead core"
265129,Headhunter,2008-11-06 15:38:00,5703,"It's also very good at dialing in the bottom on flats in the 20 to 30 ft range. The no stretch aspect of core also makes board reading that much easier... just remember that lead core and reel drag systems don't get along very well, so bear that in mind while your holding on the that double digit Sheepie!!!!! HH"
265616,Mike the Pike,2008-11-08 15:55:00,3421,Well thanks for the quick responses guys fortunately for me I have 2 kinds of planer boards.  The walleye boards from church tackle and 2 offshore boards.  I will be using the church tackle boards to clip the lead core onto.  The line clip holds any kind of line including braid and fireline.  I always appreciate the helpful folks on this site thanks again.  I will be heading off to Quinte Thursday Novv 13th.  5 more sleeps  MTP
265630,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-08 16:56:00,1362, Good luck Mike!!!!!.....I may come down for the day either Thursday or Friday...
265680,Mike the Pike,2008-11-08 22:50:00,3421,Well Steve if you do you are welcome to fish in my boat I will pm you my cell phone number.  Mike
265692,silveradosheriff,2008-11-08 23:51:00,1025,"I prefer to use the braid, so I add segments.  Personal perference...."
265697,fishindevil,2008-11-09 00:26:00,6254,"Hey mike i have told you last year,and this year,in june when we were the the BOQ that i run lead-core of the offshore boards all the time !!!! silly boy...."
265698,PERCHER,2008-11-09 00:39:00,787,"Can  FISHNDRVEL,SLOWPOKE and myself fish in your boat as well ?Dont worry I allready have your cell phone #."
265699,Mike the Pike,2008-11-09 01:08:00,3421,Ya sure no problem just bring an extra matching seat I can use a net man with your experience  BTW you should take typing lessons
265709,taper,2008-11-09 02:00:00,611,I agree with running lead core off the boards but are you guys clipping directly to the lead? I thought this was a no no.
265714,PERCHER,2008-11-09 03:03:00,787,I will trade you fishn lessons for typing lessons
265716,Mike the Pike,2008-11-09 03:17:00,3421,If it gets me a boat upgrade your on.  BTW way back when there was lots of nice wimmins in typing class.  
265830,SlowPoke,2008-11-09 17:42:00,2984,Regretting the tiller already?
265850,irishfield,2008-11-09 19:06:00,26272,  LMAO !!
266009,Mike the Pike,2008-11-10 00:33:00,3421,  Regretting the tiller already?  No boyZ I still love my tiller cause I fish walleye 90 percent of the time and trolling with a tiller is the way to go.  Ok I have to admit it may not be my last boat and as I get closer to paying our house off a full wrap windshield may be in the near future.  Oh and Wayne I noticed you like pulling tubes from a tiller boat  MTP
266010,irishfield,2008-11-10 00:36:00,26272, LOL Mike... that's because they're all terrified to be pulled by a Lund with 275HP on it !!
266021,Mike the Pike,2008-11-10 01:03:00,3421,Now thats funny Wayne
