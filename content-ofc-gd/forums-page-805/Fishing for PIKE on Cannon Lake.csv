The lake is maybe 1.5km long, and 800m wide, but that's just a guess.  The lake used to be used to transport logs in the area by floating them down the small river that feeds the lake.  Now, the lake has a TON of sunken logs, which has created a very dark, clouded look to the water.  I've always done well fishing bass in that lake around the weed beds, even pulling in some decent 2pounders.  I always seem to catch small pike as well (a lot in the 23-28"" range).  My best success is with a med. spinnerbait with worm trailer.  My question to you is, if I want to give the centre of the lake, where there is a channel that runs from one end of the lake the next, and is approx. 20' deep, what would you suggest I use, given how unclear the water is?  Perhaps jig with some brighter jigheads?  Troll with small metalic=coloured spoons?  Thanks!!! Mike"
