370139,Jonny,2009-08-06 04:12:00,1380,"Canadian Lancaster Bomber, one of only two still flying worldwide, on a  2 hour visit to the North Bay, Ontario airport, August 5, 2009, en route from Winnipeg to its home base in Hamilton.  Definitely NF but so much a part of our heritage, and so impressive, I just had to share...    Quoted from:  http://www.warplane.com/pages/aircraft_lancaster.html  Details on Andrew Mynarski:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Charles_Mynarski  Details on Canadian Lancasters (from my personal site):  http://www.personainternet.com/hjtoby/lancast.html  I uploaded 3 video clips to youtube...  Clip 1 -    Clip 2 -    Clip 3 -    And these are a few of the photos I took...  Pic 1 -   Pic 2 -   Pic 3 -   Pic 4 -   Pic 5 - This old gentleman (veteran) was missing a leg and in a wheelchair, but was dressed for the occasion and proud to be there! "
370141,blarg,2009-08-06 04:30:00,289,"I hadn't even heard about this event until today, when i drove off the base I was suprise at the number of cars parked along the road and at the airport, i got to see it fly over on its way in for a landing."
370142,Jonny,2009-08-06 04:41:00,1380,"I caught the notice in the North Bay Nugget (online) a couple of days ago, and my wife and I decided we couldn't miss it.  I figure there must have been almost a thousand people there."
370182,Lunker777,2009-08-06 12:40:00,866,and to think... during the war there were HUNDREADS of them flying over head ! I couldn't imagine the sound of those engines all rumbling together..... Even the sound of one Lancaster flying is awsome !  To bad I couldn't of been there ! Beautiful plane !
370189,pikehunter,2009-08-06 12:51:00,1659,In Hamilton we always know when the Lanc is out for a spin. The roar of the engines flying overhead is amazing! Glad you got a chance to see the big roaring bird in N. Bay. The propellers on it were just replaced this year. Spectator article  and this one  props replaced    Thanks for the post.
370195,doack,2009-08-06 12:59:00,46,"Awesome stuff, I love the old WW2 planes, and that lancaster is in great shape, would love to see that.  I have seen my share during air shows in US, but never a Lancaster, that would be fun to see.  Thanks for posting."
370196,Mike Pike,2009-08-06 12:59:00,1332,"As Pikehunter said, all of us in Hamilton know that 'drone' and as soon as we hear it, run to a clearing and look up.  Lucky to have it based here!  It's really neat to see.  My Mom still talks about how incredible it was seeing( and hearing )hundreds in formation overhead when she was a little girl in Europe during the war."
370251,JohnF,2009-08-06 16:18:00,3494,I've been meaning to get down to see it. My uncle was a tailgunner in 'em. I'd like to see where he rode in real life.  JF
370263,Jonny,2009-08-06 16:46:00,1380," As you would know, the Lancs flew at night. I included the picture of the tail turret because that's one of the hardest positions to imagine manning on the bomber. The space is incredibly small for a man wedged in between the quad .30's, bundled up in cold-weather gear for the freezing temperatures at 20,000 feet. It's hard to imagine 8+ hours shoe-horned into that small space, in the dark and the cold, isolated from the rest of the crew, peering out for something to shoot at and probably not seeing it until it shoots at you."
370281,MuskyBill,2009-08-06 17:50:00,311,"Awesome, thanks for posting these cool pics!"
370294,Headhunter,2009-08-06 19:00:00,5703,I've seen and heard it flying over T.O. around the air show dates. It still gives me shivers to hear those engines roar! Nothing else sounds like that! Thanks for the pics! HH
370327,SBCregal,2009-08-06 20:27:00,688,i was at the warplane heritage museum for a tool/trade show a few months back and saw the plane there.  its amazing... ive been meaning to get back to the museum with my camera but havent gotten to it. i should change that.
370337,Lunatic,2009-08-06 21:05:00,536,"Always my favourite plane growing up as a kid. used to go to the air shows at mount hope when i was younger with my dad and i was always found around that bomber. i also used to make delieveries to mount hope and and got to be up close with the lancaster and other planes on a weekly basis. I could just shake my head every time i saw it sitting there with ""Shell"" gas logo on the tail fin. i know the purpose of it. but still,i cant wait for all the very rare war planes to become flying bilboards"
370375,bigugli,2009-08-06 23:48:00,6138,Nothing like the distinct roar of the Rolls Royce merlin engine. You hear her coming a good 2 minutes before you see her flying over Beamsville.
370401,JohnF,2009-08-07 01:26:00,3494," My uncle didn't talk a lot about it and that's about the only thing he didn't talk a lot about, so I figgered it was a traumatic kind of experience. He told me a few stories though, and it sounded scary. Of course, he was only 17 when he enlisted so he was fearless, and immortal - then.  JF"
370504,Parisite,2009-08-07 16:30:00,66,"Love the sound of those engines.  I knew growing up that my Grandfather was in the Air Force during the War but it wasn't until he passed away a few years ago that I learned he was a Tailgunner in a Lancaster.  During his funeral a story was told about his plane being shot down and only he and a few others survived the crash into water.  If you have members of your family that survived the war, make a point of talking to them about it.  I never did but I wish I would have.  They may not be interested in talking about it until someone asks them."
370513,Lunker777,2009-08-07 18:19:00,866," I love talking to the Veterans  My grandpa wasn't IN the war.... he lived in the UK and when the war was on he was only about 5 years old. We talk about the war all the time. When I was in college I used to come home every weekend and he would give me a ride back on sundays and that was usually the topic of conversation. He doesnt remember much because he was young but he studied it more than I did.... I think he could be a historian on the war ! He told me stories that he does remember and I just listen and try to put myself in his place. Crazy !  We went back to England last year for my grandparents 50th anniversary and my grandpa and I went to the imperial war museum and also we took a flight to poland and visited Auswich. Talk about a humbling experience ! We also visited the ""Western Aproaches"" which was the naval head quarters for the Allies during the war. There was some crazy things going on there aswell !  About an hour outside of Liverpool, there are HUGE HUGE warehouses..... They used to be the hangers where the Lancs were stationed during the war. I try to picture in my head the sight of the place when the war was on. The sight of hundreads of bombers just waiting for the moment to take off and fly over europe ! The feeling the boys musta felt when the time came to saddle up and go.... I can't even imagine !  I wish I could see the Lancaster fly as often as the hamilton folks do ! Its a Beaut !"
370541,Uncle Buck,2009-08-07 21:01:00,1000,"She's a beauty alright...  one of the nicer things that comes from Hammer... LOL  Like the rest say, the roar of the engine always put a smile on your face"
370571,Jonny,2009-08-08 00:51:00,1380, It's a shame that too many of those stories are lost.  The experiences of the ordinary person can add so much to the understanding of the history and the times.
370584,bigugli,2009-08-08 01:59:00,6138,"Sadly enough, it was hard for a lot of the 'Old Sweats' to talk about what happened. You'd hear enough at the Legion at the passing of a ""Comrade"". The stories would also come out at ""Weepers"", and around Remembrance Day. Much of the details they wished they could forget and never would. Faces of the fallen that haunt them in their sleep as they relive a moment in some living hell. Uncle Bob could never face Remembrance Day or visiting the Legion. Don't blame him considering his description of  Ypres and gas attacks."
370655,musky_man,2009-08-08 17:50:00,159,"Great aitrcraft for sure -- always know when it is around when you her the roar of the merlin engines.  I am not sure the part about bomb load is correct.  My dad crewed a Halifax in WWII and I know on one raid they tooka tall boy bomb .... the grand slam was definitely too big for the Halifax's bomb doors.  Cheers,  Mark  "
