No hotspots needed more fun finding them on my own"

The launch in Penetang I think charges 20 for non residents.  Fishing up here can be good, a Musky was caught in Penetang Bay, there are Walleye, Bass. Pike  and of course access to lots of water in G-Bay   if you have a boat that can handle bigger water.  Sorry I'm not too much help but I try...  Maureen"

I can ask her maybe later today if she is back how the park is. There might be a pond there too? not sure though. Will post again after i talk to my sister, gotta get the boat hooked up now, get to go fishing, yee haw, please no lightning....  John"

The campsites are not all bunched together, so you have at least a bit of privacy in that regard. Wife liked it better than me, for like I say its is really nice if you like bird watching and walking along nice trails.  The kids swam at the beach and didn't seem to mind it being rocky and natural.  At the time I had a 12 foot car topper and a 3 hp motor and as such didn't feel comfortable in the 'big water' of Penetang, which was the only place I could find that may have had fishing opportunities.  We had checked out a small lake that was in the park, can't recall its name now, but I don't think there was any fish in it, the park staff couldn't tell anything about it anyhow  I found it kinda boring after a few days, but again, if fishing is not the top of your priority list for a camping trip...then its a great park, IMO."
