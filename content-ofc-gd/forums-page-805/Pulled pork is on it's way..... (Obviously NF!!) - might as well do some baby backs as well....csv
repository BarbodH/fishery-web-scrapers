370535,GBW,2009-08-07 20:49:00,8460,"Thanks for the reply Burt. It turned out well, tks.  I am going to bring some to my grandmother next week and she is the taste tester to let me know if I did a good job or not. Now I have to print this page so I can try the ribs too, thanks!!!  The way I do Smoked Salmon: salmon cut to portion for dinner Marinade portions for 24HRS in brine (or whatever you want to call it) in the fridge before you smoke it. Brine is made up of a 4 to 1 ratio of 4 parts low sodium soy sauce to 1 part honey. Do not bring to a boil, just hot enough that all is mixed well, let cool and add some to a spray bottle. The rest goes in the Tupperware with the meat (again soaking for 24 or more HRS) Bring smoker to 200* (I use the Kingsford charwood) and then add the “apple” soaked wood chips. Add the salmon Spray with the mix in “sprayer” every 35 to 40 min to keep fish from drying out and you are done in 4 hours. Store in vacuumed sealed bag if not eating right away and can be kept for a few months."
370555,bigugli,2009-08-07 23:07:00,6138,Long live food porn!  You did a great job there Burt.        Almost tempted to lick the screen
370016,misfish,2009-08-05 23:51:00,29133, And they wonder why they dont get the same health coverage we do.HAHAHAHA   We tried dome pulled pork at the Barrie ribfest. The sauce was way to sweet.Turned me off.Like a bit of bite.   Looks good none the less.
370036,Fish Farmer,2009-08-06 00:33:00,2234,"Looks dam good to me, sauce even sounds good. Can't wait to see it served up. Trade you for a COORS Light for some on a bun"
370049,Jonny,2009-08-06 01:08:00,1380," But I guess that's why it's called ""pulled pork"".... i.e. ""pulled-apart"".  That way you get a mix of the smoked-and-seasoned rind flavour all through the meat."
370051,Paully,2009-08-06 01:11:00,712,That looks amazing!! good on you... ENJOY!
370057,Greencoachdog,2009-08-06 01:19:00,8163,"  In our BBQ joints down here you have a choice, sliced or chopped (Burt is serving chopped)  If you go with sliced you have 3 more choices... inside, outside, or mixed!... I choose sliced/mixed!!!"
370058,Jonny,2009-08-06 01:23:00,1380, That's purty high-falootin' table fare! A menu an' all.  Darn good eatin' any way you slice (pull) it.
370072,John,2009-08-06 01:42:00,2956," Brian, that Carolina vinegar based sauce is perfect, not too sweet, not to sour."
370093,Burtess,2009-08-06 02:09:00,901," Thats why I serve it plain, with sauces on the side.  Then you can choose the tomato based or the vinegar based sauce to go with it.  What I have still to try is the mustard based sauces of South Carolina....  Burt"
370230,Burtess,2009-08-06 14:48:00,901,"Well, I figured that I might as well do a couple of racks of baby backs to go along with the pulled pork......    Rubbed up...   Burt"
370243,John,2009-08-06 15:57:00,2956,"Burt, did I tell you why I dislike you.........."
370248,Greencoachdog,2009-08-06 16:07:00,8163,Can you say CHOLESTEROL?!!!  You may want to have a checkup soon dude!

370306,John,2009-08-06 19:42:00,2956," I have made a formal request to have this thread pulled, unless of course you post your address........"
370308,TC1OZ,2009-08-06 19:44:00,987,The pork was already pulled! (Trombone wahh-wahh sound)
370333,Lunker777,2009-08-06 20:48:00,866,"hahah Food looks great..... whens the G2G ???????  My pork butt is waiting for me at the butcher as we speak... going in the cooker tomorrow morning to soak up all the juices all day while im at work !  I usually just throw mine in a bath of dianas sauce to cook.... both times Ive done it, it turned out well !!!  again.... I wish I was there to try some of yours.... If you want I can PM my addy and maybe you could mail a sandwich to me ??? haha"
370342,Burtess,2009-08-06 21:12:00,901,Done and sauced....    Plated pics to come lol...  Burt
370360,Leecher,2009-08-06 22:43:00,7832,Somehow I'm starting to dislike you LOL  Looks real yummy Burt I guess I'll have to settle for lasagna tonight   LOL Thank for shar...........  WAIT..... my lasagna smells pretty good right now and I'm not sharing Leechman

370415,Governator,2009-08-07 02:15:00,879,This is the most jeleous I've ever been of a NF post..   My spaghetti was alright.
370421,Jonny,2009-08-07 02:35:00,1380,"Just so happens my son, daughter-in-law and grand-daughter were visiting tonight so for supper we had perch breaded with bread crumbs and pickerel breaded with Panko, so I don't feel too hard-done-by.  Still, that pork looks scrumptious!"
370439,GBW,2009-08-07 04:49:00,8460,"OH man that ALL looked so good!  Too bad there was a bit of the green stuff snuck on the plate...  Now, I need to know about the rib's.  how long and how hot?  anything in the pan below or is that the drippings from the meat?  I just did a salmon and trout on mine tonight and I didn't even see this thread over the past few days, HAHAHA."
370477,Burtess,2009-08-07 14:02:00,901," The wife makes me put the green stuff on there, she says it's good for me  For the ribs I rubbed in BRITU recipie rub (I cut the salt content and omit the MSG from the original):  Best Ribs In The Universe Rub - 1/4 Batch --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  1/4 cup sugar 1/8 cup non-iodized table salt 1/8 cup brown sugar, dried 4 teaspoons chili powder 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground 1 teaspoon granulated garlic 1 teaspoon onion powder  Used a full water pan.  Temperature 230-260F.  I generally follow the idea of the ""3-2-1"" method (you can Google it for more info), but change the times.  Six hours in total with the two in the foil will cause the ribs to fall apart, I don't like that.  About 2 hrs on the cooker, foiled for 1 hour (splash of beer in there), then back on unfoiled.  Usually for about an hour, when they are almost done (""tear test"" or the temp probe glides through between bones) I sauce them and give them another 15 min. for the sauce to set up. I like 4 parts KC Masterpiece + 1 part honey... but I ran out of KCM so this time I used Bullseye.  How was your salmon?  That's something I haven't done yet but must try....  Burt"
369625,Burtess,2009-08-05 02:08:00,901,Just put a couple of 9 pounders on the Smokey Mountain Cooker.....       Rubbed up nice.....     On the cooker they go.....    Burt
369631,Greencoachdog,2009-08-05 02:14:00,8163,Pulled pork sounds nasty Burt!... I used to do that in my younger days...
369632,Burtess,2009-08-05 02:15:00,901, I try to do it as much as possible.... and my wife loves it when I do it.....
369634,Cudz,2009-08-05 02:17:00,2652,yum!
369636,Jonny,2009-08-05 02:19:00,1380,That looks a lot like an H20 smoker I've got.  Any more details on how you seasoned that and cooked it up?  And maybe a picture of the completed result?
369639,Leecher,2009-08-05 02:22:00,7832,Looks real good Burt What time did you say I should get to your place again?? Leechman
369641,Burtess,2009-08-05 02:26:00,901, This would be somewhat similar the the H2O.... this is the Weber version of the bullet smoker.  Here is the rub I use:  Southern Succor Rub  1/4 cup ground black pepper 1/4 cup paprika 1/4 cup Turbinado sugar 2 Tablespoons table salt 2 teaspoons dry mustard 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper Mix ingredients thoroughly. Makes enough rub for one pork butt.  About a fist size of oak and a fist and a half of maple for wood.  Fuel is Maple Leaf lump.  Empty water pan (foiled).  Usually run around 250-275F lid temp.  These will probably take around 13-15 hrs until finished.... check back for more BBQ porn lol...  Burt
369646,Jonny,2009-08-05 02:37:00,1380,Thanks for the recipe!  I had to look up turbinado sugar...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbinado_sugar  What temp do you try to maintain for the cooking process? Obviously a low one considering the cooking time.  Whenever I smoke meat or fish at low temp with bbq briquets and wood chips it tends to be a long process suitable for a sunny day liberally lubricated with cold beer.  But I've never gone for 13-15 hours! I think I'd fall off my chair first!
369705,Burtess,2009-08-05 11:14:00,901,Going good so far at 7am.....    Burt
369712,John,2009-08-05 11:53:00,2956," Dang Burt, you sure know how to bring tears to a guys eyes!  I'm over on Head Street salivating over my Timmies, wanna deliver a morsel.........  J..."
369736,Lunker777,2009-08-05 13:07:00,866,hahah AWSOME !!! Pulled pork is a huge favourite of mine !  I actually just ordered a small pork butt from the local butcher to make some myself ! haha I should get the call around noon to pick it up.... then it will be in the slow cooker ALL DAY tomorrow....  I cook mine in Dianas sauce all day long.... tastes pretty freaking good to me ! hahah  Mind if I stop by for dinner tonight... yours looks like it will be off the charts !!!!
369745,Burtess,2009-08-05 13:22:00,901," John, I am seriously within half a KM of you, can you smell it????  Now Lunker, you're a bit farther away....  Burt"
369752,John,2009-08-05 13:48:00,2956, That sweet smokey smell is drifting into my office.....can't concentrate!
369753,Jonny,2009-08-05 13:49:00,1380,Looks great!  What internal temperature do you aim for?
369754,TC1OZ,2009-08-05 13:51:00,987,"I'm super jealous!  My wife makes an AMAZING pulled pork just on the stove top, but don't tell her I'm drooling over yours!  We just had ribfest in St. Catharines and that looks like its going to be tastier than anything they served up!"
369756,highdrifter,2009-08-05 13:52:00,2534,HOHOHOH!!  Instant cardiac arrest material right there.  I'd leave that slab on the counter and by the end of the day it would be gone!!  Glen you is a dirt mcgirt ain't ya??!!  YUMMMERS!  cheers HD
369757,Burtess,2009-08-05 13:53:00,901," Around 195F, right now the top one is as 182F.  I am used to a temp. plateau at around 175F, but the last few I have purchased from Foodland have stalled in the low 180's.  Burt"
369922,Burtess,2009-08-05 19:28:00,901,Done!  Like a couple of meteorites.... nice!   Butt #1   Butt #2   Into the fridge for tomorrow evening...  Now to make up a batch of Carolina Red sauce....  Burt
369924,TC1OZ,2009-08-05 19:30:00,987,You gotta kill this thread man...I'm starving!
369931,Burtess,2009-08-05 19:39:00,901, Nope..... not killing it..... going to post pics of sandwiches tomorrow evening LMAO...
369936,John,2009-08-05 19:44:00,2956, Carolina vinegar based sauce too......damn! You're killin' me Burt. At least have the decency to have the wind blow in the other direction!..
369937,Burtess,2009-08-05 19:50:00,901,The rest of the family likes the tomato based BBQ sauce but I have to run the vinegar.  This is the one I make up:  Carolina Red 2 cups cider vinegar 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup ketchup 2 TBSP worchestershire sauce 1 TBSP honey 1 TBSP brown sugar 1 tsp cayene pepper 1 TBSP fresh black pepper 2 tsp sea salt 1 TBSP margarine  Simmer 15-20 minutes.  Burt
369939,John,2009-08-05 19:54:00,2956, There's a place between Fayetteville and Lumberton NC that serves up the best BBQ. You know the kinda place where your arteries harden the minute you walk through the door. They make up to 20 gallons of that sauce a day.
369997,Jonny,2009-08-05 22:57:00,1380,I just ate a big supper and those pics still make me hungry!
370007,Greencoachdog,2009-08-05 23:35:00,8163," ... more like a Filthy McNasty eh!    Dude!!!... you mangled them!!!... I prefer mine sliced, but I'm sure those will be delectable nonetheless!!!"
