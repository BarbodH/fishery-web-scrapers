There are many small boat anglers interested in participating. We are going to postpone the tournament until Sunday Aug 16th, 2009.  Sorry for the inconvenience, but I hope this will save a few on gas driving down in the morning.  Please pass the word on to those interested. We will see you on the 16th."
