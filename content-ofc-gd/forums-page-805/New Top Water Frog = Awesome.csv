The only downside of it is it only has a single hook out the bottom of the frog which tends to result in alot more missed strikes. Im new and I missed alot.  Check it out  "

Just bought another frog with coiled legs that extend when jigged, heading out tomorrow morning to see it work its magic.  Will let everyone know how it goes."
