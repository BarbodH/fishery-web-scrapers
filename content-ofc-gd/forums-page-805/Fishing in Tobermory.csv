370285,bluesky1713,2009-08-06 18:10:00,107,I went there once and my Dad and I got a charter out of Lion's Head for salmon.  I believe the charter name was the Huron Dawn.  We had a good time.  Probably caught about 6 small salmon.  The boat was fantastic.

We'll be fishing one of the local lakes for bass tomorrow, I'm not into Rainbow fishing very much, Richard"
