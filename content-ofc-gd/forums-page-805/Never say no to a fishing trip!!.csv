Much to my surprise, my wife had other plans for me  I manage to fish a little bit and catch a musky or two, which I have posted in previous posts. Anyway, vacations are expensive, (specially when everything around the house breaks on the first day and you have to replace stuff, like pool pump, air conditioning, anyway lots of fun). So by the end of my first week my budget was dry.. leaving credit as my only friend.. yippy! Then the phone rings, and a buddy of mine was offering me a spot on one of his Salmon charters in Lake Ontario for 2 days! AWESOME!  -sorry bud cant afford it, broke!  So sitting at home on vacation, NOT fishing..  I get the pictures from the trip... which made things worse... here are couple pictures of the fish...   WOW!      To make me extra happy about not fishing... he also includes this picture...   never say no to fishing trips! :-) specially trips on big waters!"
