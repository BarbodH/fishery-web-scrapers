I have only caught 'vegetarian ' fishees there before....(a fish called a roach which eats friggin moss, Barbel...looks a bit like a carp, and of course...carp) but there are Pike, Zander(bigger cousin of the walleye) and some other toothy critters....and with what ive learned here i will try and put to good use out there....all else fails i'll get some sea bass hopefully on a charter i always take on the Basin D'Arcachon near Bordeaux on the atlantic coast...famed for its oysters (YUK!)   Should be back in 4 weeks, just as the walleye and musky start strappin' on the feebags...till then....tight lines!"
