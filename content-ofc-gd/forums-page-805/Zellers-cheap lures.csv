370675,Weeds,2009-08-08 19:20:00,782,"Just a heads up, I purchased 2 packs of Senkos (normally 9.99 a pack plus tax) 2 packs of Eagle wide gaps (maybe 3.49 plus tax a pack regularly) and a scum frog (maybe 4.50ish plus tax  reg) and including tax the lot cost me about 24 bucks. I've lost my receipt, it's a talent I have, seems to happen instantly but it looks like all fishing stuff is 30% off. I don't know if it is just here in Peterborough but a decent time to grab some stuff. I didn't realize till after I bought the stuff because there were no signs or anything."
370706,Greencoachdog,2009-08-08 22:20:00,8163,How's the boat running these days?.. and where are all the Pike and Musky???  Senko's and scum frogs don't sound much like Pike and Musky baits to me!

370870,Weeds,2009-08-09 12:18:00,782,"GCD: The boat has been kind of a no go so far. I mean it goes but last time out I ran into a few problems including snapping the key off in the ignition. I have not gotten around to getting a new one cut due to the fact that I finally discovered the joys of Bassfishing (smallmouth from shore). I haven't seen a musky since opening day.  Going camping tomorrow for a week, hoping to get into some pike and Largemouth, might even get some pics for once.  A2F: My pleasure."
