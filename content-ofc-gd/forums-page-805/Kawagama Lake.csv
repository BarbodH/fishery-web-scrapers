By the looks of things the weather's going to be ugly for the first few days. Any advice that will get us out of the cottage and into some fish is appreciated - we've never been on the lake or nearby before. We've got a boat and a few kayaks, so we can go anywhere there's water.  Tips on anything in the area is appreciated - we're not fussy about what we catch, as long as we're not catching cabin fever."
