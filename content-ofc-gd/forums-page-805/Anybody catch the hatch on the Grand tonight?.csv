At around 8:15 a hatch of white Mayfly like bugs started and continued to get more intense until dark.  They had white bodies wtih long tails; they appeared to emerge, flutter their wings on the surface, and then fly away.  It looked like it was snowing with bugs going upstream, downstream and in my ears.  The Bass were having a feast nailing these guys on the surface.  I would have loved to have had my fly rod and some drys.  Any guesses as to the name of these flys???  Paul"
