Here's a quick pictorial review of July... There are some OFNer's hidden here if you look closely...grin. These are mostly, but not all, on Lower Buckhorn.                                         So that was July...let's see what August has to offer. Garry2rs"
370128,EC1,2009-08-06 03:09:00,930,"the majority of time in ponchos or long sleeves! Yup, that was July alright.  Nice fish though Garry!"
370135,JohnF,2009-08-06 03:31:00,3494,Mine was actually the biggest fish. You just take out a lot of little bitty people.  JF
370151,Garry2Rs,2009-08-06 10:25:00,1425,"John, I saved your big fish for my August report, so you will have to wait until September to see it here...grin."
370194,JohnF,2009-08-06 12:59:00,3494," Well, I sure hope it ain't the biggest fish of the month. That would be disappointing for all proud Kawarthians.  JF"
