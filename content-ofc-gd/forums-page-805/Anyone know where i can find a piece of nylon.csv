370544,HTHM,2009-08-07 21:16:00,4082,Why not use a piece of 2 x 4 glued on with PL Premium. Not as pretty but it works....
370546,Greencoachdog,2009-08-07 21:33:00,8163,"Go to Wal-mart and buy one of the white cutting boards in the kitchen accessories dept, I think they're only 1/2"" thick but you can laminate them together with a good glue."
370552,misfish,2009-08-07 22:40:00,29133,"1 inch by what? If your not in a hurry,I believe I have a peice at the shop. Not there til Monday,but could slip in Saturday. Let me know."
370558,bassboy,2009-08-07 23:25:00,161,Metal Supermarkets also sells nylon and teflon I believe....   Bill
370574,NAW,2009-08-08 01:05:00,4022,"http://www.mcmaster.com/#plastics/=33al7z  I use Mcmaster Carr all the time.  If the link above doesn't work, then just google them, or go to McMaster.com and search through the Raw Materials section.  They have a decent selection of 1"" Nylon raw material.  You can have it delivered to your house.  You just need a credit card.  I've used them for work many times, and they've never let me down."
