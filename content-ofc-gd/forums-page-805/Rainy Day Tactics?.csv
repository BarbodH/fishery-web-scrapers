370699,Greencoachdog,2009-08-08 22:00:00,8163,"I find that the fish will usually be shallower and pretty active if it's just a steady or light rain, unless it's really going to storm... then they'll be cowering in the depths!  Checkout their shallow haunts, if they aren't there use your sonar to locate them in the depths."
370733,Leecher,2009-08-09 00:24:00,7832,I would definitely use a crank bait such as BigO in this type of condition. Leechman
