We've got it down to Island Lake in Orangeville or Deer Creek (UrbanFisherman intrigued with his pictures for the charity event).  The only thing is, we haven't fished either place before, so we're looking for some input from some people who have.  We're after bass primarily, but wouldn't mind some pike (Island Lake) or trout (Deer Creek).  Let me know what you think - thanks."
