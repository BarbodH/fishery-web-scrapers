370309,John,2009-08-06 19:45:00,2956,"Looking to buy a VHF marine radio. Any comments or recommendations, handheld vs fixed mount, brand etc etc.........."
370341,fishdawg,2009-08-06 21:11:00,912,fixed mount all the way John...    we'll talk later
370350,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-06 21:34:00,10439,"Fixed, way more power and range. I put a new radio in last year that is very good, very small and waterproof. For under $200 US it's a fine radio with lots of features. Also make sure you buy a decent antenna.  ICOM M304 Marine Radio    I flush mounted mine in the console of my 18' Fisher.  "
370364,Terry,2009-08-06 23:10:00,14456,"it depends on what/where you want to use it if you are only going to use it in one boat, then a fix mount is the way to go but if you want to use it in other boats or at home or on the ice, a portable is the way to go, you can buy a portable with just as many features as a fixed mount, you can buy a amplifier to get top watts if needed and most important of all is the antenna. It is really what makes or breaks a radio the better the antenna the better the radio will work and there is an adapter so your handheld hooks up to a fixed mount antenna"
370371,Billy Bob,2009-08-06 23:31:00,5865,"Driftwood, nice install job......now you just need to replace that LMS 350A unit with a HDS unit.  P. S. a steering wheel would also be helpful....."
370404,John,2009-08-07 01:31:00,2956,"Thanks guys...as I only intend to use it in the one boat, it seems that I am going fixed mount.  Any brands to avoid? Who can steer me in the right direction as far as antenna choice?"
370409,Terry,2009-08-07 01:49:00,14456,"unless size is a problem, I would go with a 8' fiberglass , it would probably have about 6db gain"
370414,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-07 02:08:00,10439," An HDS 10 with side imaging is in the future (maybe with next years income tax refund)  I got a wheel, it's Italian and it's purdy.  "
370454,Billy Bob,2009-08-07 12:12:00,5865,I have been hearing great things about the HDS units....a bit on the pricey side but nice.....I have a LMS 520c unit on the bow and console which is also a nice set up (networked together).
370543,Uncle Buck,2009-08-07 21:13:00,1000,"fixed base John,  Emil and I were stranded out on Erie due to motor problems...  couldn't reach guys making their run in with my little handheld...  make sure you get your ROC card, they are cracking down on it now..."
370548,Terry,2009-08-07 21:56:00,14456, did you have a full size fix mount antenna or just the rubber ducky antenna any radio is only as good as it's antenna
370640,Uncle Buck,2009-08-08 15:43:00,1000,Little rubber ducky...
370725,camillj,2009-08-09 00:00:00,1988,Just wondering about proximity to your compass ... one of the boater card questions made reference to VHF interfering with compass ... have you had any trouble with that on your setup Drifter ?
370738,Billy Bob,2009-08-09 00:33:00,5865, It did on my compass but I have a compensation adjustment on the compass that corrected most of the problem.
370803,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-09 02:29:00,10439,"  Adjustments on the compas took care of it.  With my antenna being so close to my depthfinder it really messes with it during transmitting. One of these days I'll relocate the antenna, maybe when install my new finder."
