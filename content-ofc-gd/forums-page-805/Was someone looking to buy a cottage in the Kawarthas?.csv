PM me if you are interested, it should be going on the market in the next few days."

370313,Beans,2009-08-06 19:53:00,3339,Geeze Cliff...after the problems of the other day I thought you and Sue were so p/o'd that you were selling your ranch...

370385,Big Cliff,2009-08-07 00:19:00,6899,"No, it isn't winterized but the price is good and it is a nice piece of property, besides it comes with a neighbour who knows the lake and where and how to fish it, can fix most anything and knows where to find what he can't fix LOL. Actually, houses on both sides of it are assessed at about double what they are asking for this so I think it will go quickly."
