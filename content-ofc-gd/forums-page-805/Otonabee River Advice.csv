I have the new boat now and can venture around.  I was planning on launching about 6 km's up from Rice Lake.  Any advice/info would be appreciated.  Looking for bass and walleye.  Also, if you have any other suggestions on where to go for a day trip that would be cool.  Coming from Stoney Creek.  I enjoy fishing the stumps and blowdowns for bass, so that is why I picked the Otonabee.  Thanks in advance."

Bite was a little slow but ended up with a bunch of decent bass by the end of the day.  My only advice is put the trolling motor and go.  There are miles and miles of fallen trees.  Just keep fishing the trees and you will get bit."
