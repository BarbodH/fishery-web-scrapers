I have actually not been on Balsam since last September, so with the wacky water temps this year, I had a few ideas, but the 25k winds out of the west kind of ruined those plans.  Went to plan B and started on a sand flat in about 6 feet of water.  I started with a popper, but after Kelli put 4 smallies in the boat in 20 minutes on a fluke, I made the change.  We landed almost 30 smallies by 11am, but most were in the 1 - 1.5 pond range with only a couple 2 pounders.  We were having fun, but it wasnt going to win the tournament by any means.  We made a move to some deep weeds and pulled out the heavy gear.  I started throwing a 5/8 oz jig into thick weeds in about 8 feet of water.  Within minutes I slammed a 5/0 hook into a solid fish and put a 4+ pounder in the livewell.  A few 12-13 inch fish followed, no help.  With about 20 minutes left in the day I got a 2.5 pounder on the jig and that added almost a pound to our weight.  We caught over 40 fish today, but only 1 good fish.  We weighed about 13 pounds and placed 3rd.  We also took Big Fish honours with a 4.34 pound largie.  Tough day all around it seemed with the winners weighing just 14.54 pounds.  "

370365,steverowbotham,2009-08-06 23:14:00,1800," Didnt really allow it to lol.  With the small limit we had, I had that fish in the boat within 5 seconds of hooking her, no net, just craned in QUICKLY.  Gotta love heavy braid!"
370373,Leecher,2009-08-06 23:38:00,7832, Right on Steve!!!  Yes braid is one tough line and I can see her doing 90 degrees upward and into your boat Leechman
