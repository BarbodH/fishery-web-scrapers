370170,bigzinc10,2009-08-06 12:05:00,38,"Wow, white seems to be very popular. Is that colour spinner primarily for bass?? I just purchased a chartreuse spinner online, so havent tried it out yet. I am primarily going for bass.  Will chartreuse spinner work well for bass or just under specific envirnomental conditions (ie. certain colour water and visibility)?"
370173,Rich,2009-08-06 12:13:00,3927,"White is popular, yes. It simulates pretty much the majority of baitfish found in most waterbodies so no doubt it's gonna get smashed.  That being said, there is no spinnerbait color I've ever purchased that didn't catch fish. Chartreuse has it's days."
370181,Lunker777,2009-08-06 12:37:00,866, Im going on to my 4th Chartreuse with double willow leaf Booyah in 2 weeks !!   I cant seem to NOT catch anything on that bait haha Well execept last night   only a couple !  But in my neck of the woods.... White and Chartreuse are the go to colors !  I have about 7 or 8 different variations that include chartreuse in the skirt..... Works GREAT !
370190,bigzinc10,2009-08-06 12:52:00,38,"Good to know. I have all this good tackle and not a good place to fish...its so sad. I live in the brampton, mississauga area and dont have any decent spots...the only areas are conservation areas in the caledon and orangeville area, but they have daily fees...i dont find paying $5 now and again but I'd like to fish 3-4 week so that adds up....I dont have a boat, so I will primarily be doing shore fishing...looks like I will have to drive a bit north, or pay the fees to get a godd days fishing    You guys with prime fishing spots in your backyards have it so good!!!!!!!"
370191,Rich,2009-08-06 12:52:00,3927,"Yea, I think the location has a lot to do with it too for some reason. Maybe to do with PH levels, clarity, who knows. I know when I fish Cameron for bass it's pretty hard to beat a chartreuse/white skirt. Plain chartreuse, plain white catch fish.. but chart/white will outfish them like 5 - 1 most days. Use chartreuse/white down here and you'll get a couple fish.. but plain white is definitely tops. For bass anyway.  Pike fishing's a whole different game."
370456,Lunker777,2009-08-07 12:31:00,866, Yea I agree..... I fished with a buddy the other night and I threw on the plain chart. and he had plain white and I boated probably 2-1 or 3-1 ...... all bass..... then the other day I threw on a fire tiger and had pike following me the whole time.... no bass.... so I think the pike bite here is on perch ! ahhah theres lots of perch in our bay so maybe thats what the pike like !
370503,kemper,2009-08-07 16:26:00,2232,"Northam, but I make my own.  Recently dealt with Frank actually and he helped me out big time when I accidentally shipped my baits to my residence at university...and I am at home for the summer"
370507,wask,2009-08-07 16:46:00,174,What are the northam ones?  Where can they be purchased?
370512,Jonaton,2009-08-07 17:33:00,72,"http://www.northamfishing.com/  Unfortunately they are not carried by many stores, many people just order them online."
369385,Lunker777,2009-08-04 13:36:00,866,"I have been fishing with spinner baits ALOT this year..... I ALWAYS used Booyahs but I decided to try the terminator ""titanium"" ones to help with keeping the bait true..... I find the Booyah baits to bend very easily !  Well when I attempted to order the terminators... I accidentely orders Strike king spinners. I have NO IDEA how I mixed the two of them up ! IDIOT !!    They add stinger hooks to them and the profile of the head of the bait is weird and seems to get caught up alot more than the Booyahs. Needless to say the strike kings have been demoted to use when guests are on the boat ! That way if they lose one to a pike, Im not worried ! haha  I wish Booyah would come out with a titanium frame spinner bait... that would be sweet !  What type of spinners do you like to use ? and why ?"
369390,Rich,2009-08-04 13:44:00,3927,"I alternate between Boo-Ya and Terminator spinnerbaits. Boo-Yas are nice but hard to find larger ones. Not to mention a couple of pike and they're toast. However they do have very well plated blades and detailed skirts.. they catch a lot of fish. If I know I'm in a place (ie Long Point Bay) where I'm gonna be nailing a bunch of 12 inch bass all day, I'll opt for the Terminator because I know it won't fall apart."
369399,bassjnkie,2009-08-04 14:09:00,1101,"I use the Boo Ya, Strike King and Terminators. I use the Terminators where there are a lot of pike that like to kill regular wire spinner baits. Boo Ya and Strike king, I use these mainly for bass because I can bend the wire to create actions."
369404,Roy,2009-08-04 14:25:00,13728,"I don't buy them off the rack anymore. For the best quality large muskie spinnerbaits, I think TEP (Jef) makes the best quality there is. For bass, pike and muskie, Bill Cameron (Osprey baits) is hard to beat. Lately, I've been ordering  a few baits from Joey right here on the board. Whatever size or colour combo....she makes."
369477,wallyboss,2009-08-04 18:09:00,1095,"I use Northamfishing spinnerbaits most of the time,"

369506,Fishing 24/7,2009-08-04 19:46:00,709,go with northam.  i dont know why anyone would use anything else.  if the bait fails. wich never happened.  but if it does. contact frank and he will personnaly s.end you a new spinner bait EXPRESS!  try doing that with strike king or booyah.  you will cry to your mother after 2 month worth of waitting.
369543,tip-up,2009-08-04 21:47:00,94,Mostly throw Terminators when fishing spinnerbaits...Northam follows close behind
369548,dheitzner,2009-08-04 21:55:00,314,"I've been trying the new KVD spinnerbaits as of late and have been pleasantly surprised.  They are a bit pricey but they have thicker gauge wire, nice skirts with 'tails' (and a trailer hook) and have brought me a nice smallie that was pushing 7lbs a few weeks ago. Also got me 4 muskies on Sunday(3 landed) and a bunch of bass all on the same one.  This bait still fishes like it is right out of the package (minus the eyes that came off after the second 'ski). I use Booyahs quite a bit, Stanleys occasionally, no-names a little and Terminators the very odd time, I find that the blades on the Terminators foul a lot."
369553,misfish,2009-08-04 22:14:00,29133,"Boo Ya,Stanley spinner baits here.  Franks a local and I need to get some from him and give them a try."
369563,Burning Babies,2009-08-04 22:41:00,150,"Strike King Premier Pro Models in 3/8 and 3/4 oz are my go-to spinnerbaits.  I play around with a lot of different brands though.  Nichols are great, and I've done pretty well with BPS Lazer Eye Pro's recently (although I hate the quick change clevis).  I've been playing with Revenge (nice compact ultra-heavies), Punisher, and War Eagle as well this year.  I don't like the trailer hooks on the Strike King Plus series, but only because I think they're too small.  You need to be fishing spinnerbaits with trailers, IMO.  They account for probably 1/3 of my spinnerbait bass, and don't substantially increase my fouling.  I generally like BPS 2/0 XPS trailers for performance and value, although with some baits, I find I need a long shank hook for the blade to work properly."
369564,richyb,2009-08-04 22:47:00,774,I just go up the road to tromblys tackle and get the ones they have 3 for 10 bucks. Havent had one break yet. After a whack of fish the lead heads start to get loose but i just crimp em back with pliers .

369574,singingdog,2009-08-04 23:08:00,1047,"Custom made from Kawartha Lakes Bait and Tackle. He makes a titanium frame spinnerbait, with Gammy hooks for less than what a Booyah will cost you."
369583,bigugli,2009-08-05 00:00:00,6138,I use the same ones.  Black Fly Lures is the company. Very decent and great colour combos. We run into each other a couple times a year doing the small shows.
369592,Cudz,2009-08-05 00:57:00,2652,I am not really fussed.  I have caught fish on $0.99 spinnerbaits and they are almost as effective as $5 spinnerbait.  I laughed at a buddy of mine who just bought 2 spinnerbaits at $15 a pop.  They were Lucky craft spinnerbaits and he threw them a lot and didn't catch a thing. I like 3 colours WHite Black Firetiger  In that order
