7147,FishHeadRic,2006-12-01 01:12:00,226,I never agreed with shark fishing. It's really gotta have a serious effect wiping out the top predator of an eco-system. I've seen first hand what goes on in shark tourneys. There is no C&R! All fish caught are killed. On top of that a  lot of the sharks that are killed by commercial fisherman are just having their fins cut off and being sent back alive with no fins. It's messed up what we're doing to our oceans. It's messed up what we're doing to sharks. There's a total disrespect going on and our kids and grand kids will be the ones who will suffer the consequences.  FHR
7159,mepps,2006-12-01 01:48:00,1301,An amazing fish for sure...   As for the phone number - It cold be a phone number from an old owner of the fork lift.  I saw machinery in the Virgin Islands with Canadain numbers and flags on em.
7162,ShaunB,2006-12-01 01:52:00,73,These guys probably killed it because it is a bit of an odity and it is eating the fish they make their living off of.  My 2 cents
7163,Crazyhook,2006-12-01 01:58:00,1154,Mako meat is very expensive and tasty.. not sure what one that big would taste like though
7174,POLLIWOGG,2006-12-01 02:29:00,835,We've got bigger ones in BOQ so be carefull when you pee over the side.

370661,camillj,2009-08-08 18:16:00,1988,  And a fork-n-knife !
370662,Dutchy,2009-08-08 18:18:00,416," Couldn't agree more.  The amount of fish sharks eat is tiny compared to what we take out of the ocean, so that argument about ""protecting commercial fishing"" is non-existant. Most sharks that size are after things like seals etc anyway. Long-line commercial fisherman are one of the main killers of sharks unfortunately. Like FishHeadRic says, removing a predator from the eco-system is never a good thing, and often many other species die off as well as a result.  It would have been much better to have cut the line and let the shark go. Sheesh, if you want to see a MAKO, and alive at that, go to an aquarium."
370670,lhousesoccer,2009-08-08 18:57:00,442,"They were only in danger, as you say, because the idiots TIED the shark to their boat.  There's no reason in the world to kill a shark.  If they were commercially long-lining for dogfish and caught the shark by accident, cut the line, don't rope it to your bloody boat and wait for it to drown itself, and possibly you along with it.  That's just a pathetic waste of majestic marine life.  Some people clearly need their heads examined.  No wonder shark populations are in decline ...."

370692,Kinger,2009-08-08 20:45:00,351,"Not even Pronger would take it on...         All kidding aside, thats a Mako shark. The color and teeth and head shape give it away. Such a waste killing that beautiful killer."

6536,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-29 20:33:00,0,"Just received this from a coworker, thought I would pass along.....   Caught off Ucluelet BC   While the ocean vessel 'Dawn Raider' was commercial fishing for dogfish, this Great White was hooked in the mouth but only resisted slightly for 15 minutes before it came up alongside the boat to have a look; long enough for one of the crew members to slip a rope around it's tail And that's when the s**t hit the fan!!. The Shark took off towing the 42 foot fishing boat backwards through the water at about 7 Knots.Just like in JAWS, the boat was taking on water over the stern and the crew watched in horror as the shark would actually jump completely out of the water at times. This went on for an hour before the shark finally drowned. She weighed in at 1035 LBS. It is suspected she followed a weak El Nino current into local waters in search of food. Although mid 60 deg. water is considered ideal for these sharks, the larger ones can  tolerate water in the low 50s.    "
6537,bassmaster4,2006-11-29 20:37:00,801,thats one hell of a shark once in a lifetime for sure its mouth is all gushy

6542,douG,2006-11-29 20:56:00,2693,"This is from Snopes.com.  Shark Catch in Yarmouth Nova Scotia  This Mako was hooked in the mouth, only fought slightly for 15 minutes, came up along side of the boat to have a look, long enough for one of the crew to put a rope around it tail!!! That's when the s**t hit the fan!!  The female mako shark pictured here was hooked in August 2004 during the Yarmouth Shark Scramble (an annual shark-fishing derby) by 28-year-old Jamie Doucette of Wedgeport, Nova Scotia, who battled the monster fish for 40 minutes before landing it. According to one newspaper account of the event:  In a scene reminiscent of ""Jaws,"" the fish tugged the boat sideways [and] surged to the surface near the bow, a mako with a broad head and rows of razor teeth, chewing through steel leader.  Doucette reeled it in and other anglers wrapped it in ropes as the shark chewed through the knots. One loop circled its torso, the other the tail; one man leaned over the boat and slit its throat as Jaws thrashed for something to bite. It died 20 minutes later.  The shark was officially measured at 10 feet, 10 inches (3.3 meters) and 1,082 lbs. (492 kg), netting $3,000 in prize money for Doucette, who said:  I felt bad that we caught her at the prime of her reproductive cycle. When they get to be this massive they call them queens of the sea. I would have let her go if I had been by myself, but it's different when you have four or five other guys on the boat. You've got to win.  As chronicled at the Magazine Yarmouth web site, other circulating versions of these photographs erroneously place the shark catch on the wrong coast of Canada, warning readers to stay away from Port Albion, Ucluelet, and Barkley Sound in British Columbia.  Note the phone number on the jib crane.  902 area code is Nova Scotia, and 481 is a Dartmouth exchange."
6544,Guest mistyriver1,2006-11-29 21:04:00,0,"I noticed the phone number on the crane too Doug, but thought maybe it was just where the crane was made.  Oh well, never said I was verifying the story, but the pictures are still cool."
6545,kemper,2006-11-29 21:08:00,2232,"Theres a (902) in the background of the first picture as well. I think its on the boat.  It also looks like a mako and not a great white, but WOW whats a fish!"
6546,douG,2006-11-29 21:09:00,2693,"You're right, Mistyriver1.  I added absolutely nothing to your story. Amazing day on the water for a few folks for sure."
6551,Fang,2006-11-29 21:32:00,1330,Thanks for the detective work guys. After seeing the head and teeth I thought no way Great White. They have much more conical teeth and different dorsal but then started doubting as it's been a long time for me.  Was fascinated with sharks as a kid and used to read everything I could get my hands on.  Very impressive fish no doubt.
6552,setomonkey,2006-11-29 21:33:00,872,Now I don't know what to believe when someone posts a story...  Mike  p.s. Too bad they killed that shark.
6554,Whopper,2006-11-29 21:37:00,2174, Don't feel bad Mike I feel like that everyday about a lot of things.    Whopper
6561,steve_paul,2006-11-29 21:58:00,658,"Pretty cool pics Misty, thanks.  Not sure where it was caught but if that thing popped its head out of the water near my boat I think I would leave a soil stain from Dartmouth to Ucluelet."
6568,Jigger,2006-11-29 22:40:00,1237,"Thats a BC story from last year. My Dad scanned the original newsprint, but I've switched from Rogers to Bell and lost all my old emails. Definately in BC, definately a G.White shark."
6575,Rizzo,2006-11-29 22:45:00,4754,"whatever the heck it is, much bigger shark than I thought could be found anywhere near Canadian waters"
6596,irishfield,2006-11-29 23:31:00,26272, Then why is the phone number on the crane from the East Coast?
6617,Carp,2006-11-30 00:16:00,1488,Now dats a fish !!!
6626,FishHeadRic,2006-11-30 00:24:00,226,  Actually that is a Mako. The shot of the teeth give it away. Lower jaw has the multiple rows in front.  Plus the body isn't right for a White. It's a very large mako though.   FHR
6631,fishindevil,2006-11-30 00:31:00,6254,"WOW...talk about a monster, holy crap  i can imagine what the crew and the ship went through trying to get that shark subdued,   thats quite a catch"
6643,Jigatollah,2006-11-30 00:47:00,53,"If you go to google images and type in mako shark, those exact pictures are there."
6672,Clampet,2006-11-30 01:28:00,1947,I read the link info and it sure is a awesome fish.  1335 lbs!!
6703,Mako,2006-11-30 02:29:00,25,"Yep thats a Mako, as Ric said the teeth give it away.....it also has the blue tint to it. This one is huge and at first glance looks like a white ....but they are rare around Nova Scotia. Here is a link to a white thats had been caught off PEI: http://nautilus.mathstat.dal.ca/shark/english/white.htm  The yarmouth village paper is onto the hoax http://www.yarmouth.org/magazine/urban.htm Info on Makos and other east coast sharks http://www.newenglandsharks.com/shortfin.htm http://nautilus.mathstat.dal.ca/shark/english/mako.htm"
6709,Jigger,2006-11-30 02:51:00,1237,"Thanks for the links guys, I could've swore it was what the article said. The pics in the original article were very grainy, and the only pic, I think, that was in it was the second one. I stand corrected."
6716,Pete Maina,2006-11-30 03:17:00,213,Now that's a whopper ... I can't wait for spring!  Pete
6721,BabyHerc,2006-11-30 03:31:00,285,"The teeth are a dead give away it's a mako, but the size?!?  I didn't think makos get that big.  WOW!"
6750,Mike the Pike,2006-11-30 04:38:00,3421,Yes its not safe to fish in BC anymore or maybe the maritimes.Nice observation Wayne
6831,Basskicker,2006-11-30 13:54:00,421,"Actually it's pretty sad that another creature of our vast oceans has to die.  Drowning.....think about it.... how sad is that, a shark drowns while in the water.....I'm sure they could have released it (cut the line) or something.....hopefully it was feed to those you need it....and not thrown it the garbage.....my little rant for this morning.....cheers  Jason"
