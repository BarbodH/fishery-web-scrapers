370202,DANIMAL,2009-08-06 13:18:00,215,I am thinking about trying georgian bay for for my first time for musky this weekend.       I have a good map of the severn sound area. Would this be a good area to start?        And generally what type of structure should I be looking for? And any other tips and tricks anybody is willing to offer would be great. Feel free to PM me if you dont want to post. Thanks.
370204,BillM,2009-08-06 13:26:00,17367,"GBay is a really tough tough place for musky, unless you know where you are going..  Good luck.  If you wanted fish, hit one of the Kawartha lakes."
370215,Raf,2009-08-06 13:49:00,3495,"deep water, rocks, weeds.. in that order.  step back, have a look at your map and you'll be able to identify likely spots (ie. points, islands, saddles, shoals)."
370217,DANIMAL,2009-08-06 13:53:00,215,Yeah I've been fishing the Kawarthas for a few years now and have had some good days for numbers of small to decent size fish. Now I want to try for a giant.
370218,DANIMAL,2009-08-06 13:56:00,215,"Thank raf. And what's deep for the bay, maybe 20-30 ft."
370223,Raf,2009-08-06 14:00:00,3495,"you can be spitting distance to a rock that'll take your lower unit off but be in 60' of water.   there are times we have the boat sitting in 40'+ casting at a shoal a few feet beneath the surface.  don't be afraid to cast to the deep side too.  i'd say though, for you 1st time up there, there's no better way to start picking apart teh water than trolling.  you will find spots to cast."
370252,tdotfisherman,2009-08-06 16:19:00,317,Georgian Bay Musky fishing.. hopefully you are a patient man..  On G-Bay we consider ourselves lucky if we raise one Musky or get one follow in an entire day of fishing..  Good luck.

That's my new water thinking too.  Best of luck, Hope to here some good news on your return!"
370447,musky66,2009-08-07 10:05:00,273,Took us three years of camping at Massassauga to get a couple of skis in the boat- well worth it though! Don't overlook trolling with blade baits- produces for me all season long.
370476,Johnny Dadson,2009-08-07 14:02:00,7,Georgian Bay is one of the most beautiful places in the world and one of the toughest bodies of water to catch a Musky.  Especially a quality fish...  Keep in mind that alot of good anglers only take a handful of fish per season and have fun.  Anything can happen on the Bay.  Johnny
370563,farsider,2009-08-07 23:59:00,456,"And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you can run two rods per person if you are trolling.  Cheers, Mark"
370564,camillj,2009-08-08 00:29:00,1988,Wrong !
370629,Terry,2009-08-08 13:47:00,14456, consider yourself corrected ...LOL  not on Georgian Bay
370663,farsider,2009-08-08 18:26:00,456,"I had to go and recheck the regs for myself (after I posted, doh!).  Sure enough, I was mistaken.  It states in the exceptions on p.65 regarding zones 13 & 14, although this is clearly marked as an exception for zone 13  listed under waterbody  listed under exception details  Why even bring up Georgian Bay or the North Channel(zone 14)?  Just cite Zone 13 and exclusions therein.  On a totally different bent, why can't you run two lines on Georgian Bay?  Its allowed on most of the Great Lakes and even the Lower Niagara. It just seems so arbitrary.  Ain't government grand.  Cheers, Mark"
370672,Terry,2009-08-08 19:05:00,14456,"that's so true  but, it is the law"
370682,SBCregal,2009-08-08 20:05:00,688,what about pike up in georgian bay? are they a bit more common than catching musky?
370708,musky66,2009-08-08 22:23:00,273,"Yes, plenty of PIke, and very tasty!"
