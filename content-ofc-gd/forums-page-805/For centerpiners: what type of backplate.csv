370687,blue pickeral,2009-08-08 20:22:00,267,Found a $10 tin of compressed air - Can Tire/Radio Shack - cleaned up reels really well. Just keep it out of the sun.
370742,tibbs,2009-08-09 00:38:00,650,My Islander has a few hole in it and sometimes gets sand in it but i just rinse it in the water and it comes right out.
370289,okumasheffield,2009-08-06 18:40:00,318,"Hi all,  I noticed that I always get some sands in my Okuma Sheffield after every outing no matter how careful I am.  No, I dont put reels on the ground and I always put it in the pouch even just walking from point A to point B ... wonder how it is possible  Do you think centerpins with sold backplate have less chance to have such a problem?"
370290,BillM,2009-08-06 18:43:00,17367,Never had a problem with sand or debris in my AngSpec and it has a solid backplate.
370307,John,2009-08-06 19:43:00,2956,"Ahhhhhhh, it was a nice summer while it lasted......."
370354,charlied,2009-08-06 22:00:00,584,"i have a sheffield and mine gets sand inside too.  I just wash it out after or when I am not lazy!!  I really don't worry about it, and can't afford a better one."
370390,ironstone74,2009-08-07 00:45:00,201,Had that issue with my Islander in the Spring.  It was easy enough to take it apart  and wipe it down.  It has a ported back plate.  Paul  It's almost that time again boys!  I'm starting to get the itch
370391,danbo,2009-08-07 00:51:00,2646,Stop laying it in the water or on the ground just to take pictures of your fish!
370394,ironstone74,2009-08-07 00:59:00,201, Don't be jealous because he catches fish.  Haha.
370397,solopaddler,2009-08-07 01:18:00,8605,Ported backplates have never been a hindrance. In fact their lighter weight is a big plus. As far as sand and grit go...the reels are meant to be fished not babied. If any debris does get in via the backplate a quick shake and spin underwater takes care of the problem. It's only an issue when the temps dip below freezing. If you dunk your reel in minus temps it'll freeze solid so you've got to be extra careful...
370440,rbaquial,2009-08-07 04:53:00,968,I'm SO NEW to this type of fishing - I have no idea what's going on! What the heck is a backplate? (I assume its solid looking?) Is it something you can 'BUY' to ADD to the floatreel/centrepin? Or is it a specific STYLE of Floatreel/Centerpin?  I'm such a n00bie to this fishing style!
370441,KelfuN,2009-08-07 05:14:00,246,"only happened once with my kingpin.. a quick wipe did the job.  btw, my pin is solid back plate"
370445,rbaquial,2009-08-07 05:59:00,968,"I apologize it I sound really noobi3 - but I have this stupid willingness to want to learn more about this style of fishing... Anyway, this is my floatreel.... stupid question? but this is considered Backplated?   :dunno:    "
370449,MJL,2009-08-07 11:38:00,2427," It's literally the backside of the reel...In your case, it's the piece of metal with the word MATRIX on it.  My islander has a ported backplate - Meaning there are holes drilled into the back of the reel "
370467,craigdritchie,2009-08-07 13:31:00,1586, Couldn't have said it better - basically a non-issue.
370470,BillM,2009-08-07 13:50:00,17367,Ported Backplate:    Solid Backplate:  
370478,blaque,2009-08-07 14:04:00,2419,"I have a solid backplate, and its a rare occasion that i bind up on a piece of grit.  Now iced up tips, thats a different story lol"
370486,BillM,2009-08-07 14:36:00,17367," As a newb to float fishing, this drives me up the wall."
370502,kemper,2009-08-07 16:24:00,2232," Bill, buy a blistex lip chap for two bucks and put it in the pocket of your vest.  Chap up the guides the night before and the morning of and say bye bye to iced up tips. It saves you from having to ask your buddy to suck on your er...tip?  Right Dave?"
370505,craigdritchie,2009-08-07 16:32:00,1586,PAM cooking spray also works. Spray it on a Q-Tip and wipe down the eyelet.
370506,aniceguy,2009-08-07 16:33:00,1094," yup but Mike I think Im giving up te long stick and drag free drifts and will ply the waters with these, I just need to make a decision on colors   lol"
370508,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-07 16:56:00,10439,I like my solid back plate reels. I tend to lie them in the dirt and river when releasing fish and have fewer issues with grit. But as Mike says a swish and spin under water usually fixes 'er up.
370519,rbaquial,2009-08-07 18:37:00,968, Thanks MJL for clarifying such a n00bi3 question....
370550,KelfuN,2009-08-07 22:23:00,246,or you could spend some money and get size 6 guides for the first 3 guides..then ice will not be a problem 
370551,BillM,2009-08-07 22:30:00,17367,"  I'd hate to rip apart my GL3 and Loomis IM6 in order to install new guides, lol  I think I'll give the chapstick idea a try!"
370612,solopaddler,2009-08-08 10:28:00,8605," You've got the right idea but not the right size. 6 is extremely small. Most guys finish off their rods with 7's, to avoid ice 8's are a bit bigger..."
370614,Spiel,2009-08-08 11:50:00,9065," Exactly right Mr. Mike and the job of replacing a few guides on the tip end is no biggy, Bill, even on your Loomis'."
