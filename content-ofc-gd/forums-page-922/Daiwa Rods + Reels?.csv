I've been looking at buying a new baitcasting combo for spinnerbaits lately and have been looking at some Daiwa rods and reels.  Any of you guys have used these?  Daiwa Tierra Rod  Id get the 7' Med. Heavy rod.  Daiwa Exceler  Any opinions on the would be great.  Or if you have any other suggestions on a rod and reel combo for less then $150 that would also be great.  Thanks a lot,  Tibbs"

284802,danbo,2008-12-28 18:27:00,2646,Don't skimp on the reel! Get a better one like the TD 153 HSTA.. I luv mine!
284814,NANUK,2008-12-28 19:08:00,797,"The rod you mentioned would be fine, as for the reel go with TD Advantage 153 HSTA like mentioned above. great reel!!"
