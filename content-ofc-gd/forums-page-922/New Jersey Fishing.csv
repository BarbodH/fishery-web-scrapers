122445,Chrispy,2007-10-11 13:14:00,168,"Hey Mepps, was there last year and got out fishing on the ocean.....I took a party boat with a bunch of Buddies from Brick New Jersey.....it was a really great time!!!  We fished for fluke....we ended up with about 20 or so between the 5 of us we also got a ton of small sharks, ocean robins and a couple other types that I didn't know what they were??  It was really cool a couple of Japanese fishermen were with us and they caught a couple of fish and we had fresh sushi right on the boat....make sure to bring your lunch and a bunch of beers and have a blast!!!!  Not too sure about the fresh water fishing??  I know one of my Buddies goes to New York State for bass and musky but not sure how far away you would be to good fishing???  Hope you get out!!!   Chrispy! "
