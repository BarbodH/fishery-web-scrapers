I do have a considerable amount of pics though, and that's all I need!!!  I feel that a pic captures the moment far better than a mount or replica."

284088,Radnine,2008-12-26 17:46:00,1538,Just how expensive are these pieces of art anyway? Jim
284094,jwl,2008-12-26 18:18:00,1056," my musky was just over $400..and that was a great deal actually..it was around $7/inch, plus the driftwood log it is mounted on and an engraved little plaque with my name,date and location caught ect"
284221,ch312,2008-12-27 01:58:00,1590,not many replicas actually look real. skin mounts always look better when done by a GOOD guy.
284236,waterwolf,2008-12-27 02:51:00,556,"don't have any mounts myself , being mostly a c&r fisherman , but i think seeing a great fish on the wall knowing it 's still alive out there would be a decent feeling . iced a decent pike last sunday 34 in. or so [no tape ,fishin' solo] fought like a freight train, felt just as good releasing that wolf. rep.'s get my vote. visit advanced facilities if you any questions ,they'll walk you thru the whole process ,show you some amazing  mounts you'd swear were just pulled live from the lake . lie 'bout the fish you got mounted?? ,, who could look up at that everyday just to remind yourself you're a liar?? that would suck."
284309,Spiel,2008-12-27 12:22:00,9065," ....ooooh, a tad harsh Glen. In my case not all of the mounts are large (old fish) and the meat was saved for consumption in four of them. The other two, a pair of large cohos (male & female) were destined for a non productive spawn and certain death in a few months from capture. Any good taxidermist will save the meat for you if you ask or as in my case I removed it myself. First thing I asked myself (and so should everyone) in each case was ""could the fishery support the removal/harvest"".  As for vanity well I have a mirror."
284412,profisher25,2008-12-27 19:06:00,185,"I think if you want the most realistic mount, go for a skin mount, but make sure your getting a good taxidermist!  ... but if your looking more towards just having a fish mounted, then go for replica! Lots of replicas look pretty realistic... if you want though the most realistic replica, that all depends on you! For a realist mount, you want to get the exact Measurements, get many pictures of the front, back, n sides of the fish, Give all that information to your taxidermist, and you should have yourself a very realistic replica!"

As for preference on ""real deal"" or ""replica.""...i can only associate this with real boobs or  breast implants....who cares....they are both satisfying either way ...i dont have a problem looking regardless   Thats replica bait in his mouth...."
284540,camillj,2008-12-28 00:38:00,1988,"  I have a skin mount for a 11lb 8oz Pickeral from 1983 ... still my Personal best (and not from Quinte - it was from Calabogie) ... it still looks awesome ... and fresh ... and real... it was done by the now deceased ""best in world"" Jack Wilson .. so perhaps I am basing my opinion on a rare breed...   I also have a 1lb 10oz Speck which was done by Advanced about 5 years ago .. it looks Speck-tacular (considering its a fake) ... but personally the skin mount looks and feels more authentic .. the replica (even though the fish was sacrificed to the cause) ... just doesn't look as real... but thats just  me."

I know that one method is little more expensive and I know that by choosing the replica method, you are releasing a trophy back into the water to be caught again in the future.  Does a replica look fake? Does a skin mount look more realistic? Any thoughts would be graetly appreciated.  Thanks, DIRK...................."
283584,bucktail,2008-12-24 17:17:00,1857,"Quality replicas cannot be topped, they dont age, dry or crack. I have 2 from Advanced and they are just awesome. I would never consider a skinmount again!  My largemouth from Advanced      My pike from my avatar     "
283585,trapshooter,2008-12-24 17:18:00,1234,Check out Advanced Taxidermy's web site and have a look at some of their replicas.  www.advancedtaxidermy.com  Skin mounts deteriorate over time and look awful after a number of years on the wall.  When I decide to get something mounted there's no question it will be a replica.
283586,Fang,2008-12-24 17:18:00,1330,"If you get to the Spring Fishing or Sportsman show, go around the booths and look at their mounts - ask who did theirs. The finished mount really depends on whose doing the work not whether it's skin or fiberglass. Replicas look pretty much the same way from day one.  I for one would go replica as the work I've seen is really good. The detail in the molds and ability to spray a realistic colour pattern is worth the money. My buddy has a half dozen from Advanced Taxidermy and not much compares to theirs"
283588,Beats,2008-12-24 17:23:00,543,I'm expecting my replica from Advanced to be done sometime around the first of the month.  I'll be sure to post pics when it arrives.
283590,jwl,2008-12-24 17:30:00,1056,I have seen some great work either way..depends on the artist who paints it up.  My only beef with a replica mount is...it's not your fish..anyone can take a pic. over exagerate by a few inches on lenght and gerth and they will do you one up...there's no lies with a skin mount
283608,Leecher,2008-12-24 18:13:00,7832,"I only have one skin mount and it's still looking good after all these years....    I will definitely get a replica done next time I catch a trophy It's loads of fun to hook into a big fish, take a few pics and measurements but also rewarding to release it so it can be caught another day.  I agree with jwl that anyone can take a pic but to avoid this would mount the replica on a big wooden plaque and get the photo laminated and stick it to the plaque.  Just my thoughts Leechman"
283613,jwl,2008-12-24 18:34:00,1056,yes the pic thing is a great idea to put on or around your mount for sure.  The guy who did mine has won many awards and I don't see my mount deteriorating any time soon 
283616,Leecher,2008-12-24 18:41:00,7832, Right on Jack    right on    very nice
283621,musky_man,2008-12-24 18:58:00,159,"JWL,  No lies with a skin mount?  Oh yea, there is .... not in length, but in girth."
283622,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-24 19:04:00,0,I had one skin mount done by GÃ¼nter's Taxidermy in Parry Hoot. Had it fixed by Advanced.....  I've had two replicas done by Advanced as well.  You tell me what you would do. See for yourself.        The only thing is that ya gotta keep the kids away from the......lol. The Ski has no teeth ....lol...and the Largemouth has come off the wall a few times...with help....lol. I have to say that the skin mount even bring touched will destroy it easily. The others can take some good KID punishment and still survive....LMAO
283625,diggyj,2008-12-24 19:28:00,548,"Great looking pics! Thanks all. I will definately be looking for vendors at the Sportsman show in March. I have also heard that turn around time for a mount is up to and over a year, is that correct? Obviously good work takes time."
283626,jwl,2008-12-24 19:30:00,1056," really in a skin mount, most likely the girth will come out smaller than the fish actually was because the skin shrinks when dried..this is the ""before"" pic of my fish, it wasn't mounted with the big buldge in it's stomach,which turned out to be a 15 1/2 inch cat fish   , the only way to stuff a fish way bigger would be to leave a huge gap at the back where it was stapled together and covered with felt, then the fins ect would not line up correctly on the fish and it would look a little off kilter when done.

283627,misfish,2008-12-24 19:31:00,29133,WHAT no whitefish mounts?????????????????  Nice fish Andy.

Don't know what it weighed. Im not one for guestimates but the measurements were 24 by 18  .........  . doesnt look any bigger than Bucktails fish..."
283679,bucktail,2008-12-25 00:22:00,1857,"I can say with certainty we are pretty well tied. 24 x 18 was the measurement on mine as well. Caught it many years ago. Have caught a few 23""s and change since then but they didnt have the bulk of this dude.  Real picture of the pike, I dindt take any girth measurements on her so I let the guys at Advanced figure it out but she was 48     Here is the bass. Only got the one photo of her but did all the measurements. I am not sure if the bass is fat or I was just skinny back then!  "
283685,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-25 00:54:00,2038,  Well they are both serious looking Bass 6lbs 10 oz to Maybe 7lbs   Congrats to both of you guys
283695,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-25 01:51:00,0,I guess so..... but I wouldnt put a 7 lber on my wall..  ..
283707,trapshooter,2008-12-25 03:30:00,1234,  7lbers are for the dinner table eh Andy. hahaha.
283774,Spiel,2008-12-25 12:01:00,9065,....I have six skin mounts of which three are over thirty years old and they look as good as the day they were done. If the taxidermist is good skin mounts are good. Mind you when I had four of my mounts done Advance Taxidermy was not around.  Now I like the work I've seen from Advance and would consider it in the future but I kind of like the idea of having the origional fish on the wall.
283929,danbo,2008-12-25 22:24:00,2646,"Skin mounts are way cheaper usually, but why kill a nice bass when a replica will remind you of that great day. Damaged fins can be repaired/repainted too. A nice Wood Slab with bark is cool,  as is a piece of local driftwood. I used to do Taxidermy & really miss it now.Best of Show in '83 Amateur."
283936,Greencoachdog,2008-12-25 22:47:00,8163,Skin mounts are fine!... if you don't mind murdering large and very old fish for doing nothing other than biting you bait and giving you their best fight for their life... all for your own vanity.
283952,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-26 00:02:00,2038,"    You don't neccassarly have to murder it ,, just leave it out of the water for an extended peroid of time"
