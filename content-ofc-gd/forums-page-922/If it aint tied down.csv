284727,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-28 15:29:00,0,You will find it down the lake. I know that some operators up on Nipissing have lost huts to this wind. Won't say who.  ... Its nasty out there. Phone and check your bookings later today. Was up to cooks bay this morning and watched a guy slide down the lake a mile or two as he had no cleats. He's just lucky the wind wasn't pushing him to open water. He picked up speed as he went...on his hands and knees....nothing he could do. Caught two fish....rain started.....wind picked up with gusts to 60 mph or more......that was enough for us.... Ice wasn't to bad really.

284737,Terry,2008-12-28 15:36:00,14456,yeah I didn't think it would be good to go today so I sat at home  I bet they lose all the huts on simcoe that are not well tied down
