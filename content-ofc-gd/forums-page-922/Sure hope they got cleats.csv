And it hurts when ya fall on yer    out there.  Pretty cool though,lightning and thunder in December. Nothing like a free car wash.LOL"
284358,irishfield,2008-12-27 16:37:00,26272,"Absolute down pour up here.. snow is taking a beating and turning to fog !  As for cleats... bought some rubber strap ones in ""as seen on TV"" store the other day."
284367,johnnyb,2008-12-27 16:57:00,3413,Yup -- LakerJessy unwrapped a pair of cleats for Christmas this year....she can't wait to try 'em out.  I got a few new lures which will hopefully help me keep pace with her and her fish catching ways....

284386,tjsa,2008-12-27 17:51:00,1578," We didn't get any downpour up here, but it did lightly rain from about 2 pm until 8 pm yesterday. It is a bit foggy today, but about 1 km visibility on the roads in town. Its supposed to go down to -11C tonight from a high of +1C overnight. Should be nice and slippery tomorrow.  I have had cleats for over12 yrs, have needed them 3 or 4 times over the years."
