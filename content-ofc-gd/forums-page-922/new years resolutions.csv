284543,pike slayer,2008-12-28 00:42:00,1177,hahaha you better have a good 4x4 truck or 4wheeler cause im a wild driver in the bush haha

284574,pike slayer,2008-12-28 01:23:00,1177,you dont exactly need a new years resolution or have to stick with it. more of what are you short term(one year) fishing goals. and good to hear barbless get out and often you need to make up for 2008!
284623,Leecher,2008-12-28 03:39:00,7832,"Mine is simply to get out there as much as I can..... last year was one of the best softwater & hard water season as far as fish quantity.... not the biggest but a lot of them  That being said, wouldn't mind hooking into some big eyes or channel cats Leechman"
284627,Hubbard,2008-12-28 04:02:00,22,"Mines gonna be just to get out on the water as much as possible, maybe buy a boat and hopefully catch my PB LMB, this year was a PB Walleye."
284632,bigugli,2008-12-28 04:12:00,6138,"Get out as often as I can and enjoy every minute of it.  Learn a few new things. Fish new water. Introduce a couple more kids to the fun in fishing.  Keeping it simple, and keeping it fun."
284685,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-28 13:29:00,2585,mine is to get out fishing with my wife and son a few more times this year!  My son is going ot be 3 we fished off shore a few times and he caught rockbass and small smallmouth.  it was a blast!  My wife has been fishing with me once in 10 years (this past summer) so im gong to get her out with me agian this year!  Cheers!
284694,huey graphite,2008-12-28 14:27:00,362,I'm determined to get out more this year. In 2008 only got my boat on the water twice and fished neither time. In order to do so will mean a change in employers and that should happen any day now.
284729,pike slayer,2008-12-28 15:31:00,1177,great goals guys! nobody has a plan to catch a pb or anything?
284751,Radnine,2008-12-28 16:18:00,1538,"I couln't have said it much better myself. Fishing last year (and 1st year as a boat owner) helped me to get to know my brothers-in-law better, patch up a bit of a rift with an old friend, and give my son another reason to look forward to hanging out with his old man. I have got four cottages booked for next summer and am praying for the winds to lay down a bit more on Erie. In other words I am looking forward to a great softwater season. And, as Biggy said, learning a few things. Jim"
284755,tibbs,2008-12-28 16:24:00,650,I want  to get out on the water more and maybe learn to hunt this year.
284758,danbo,2008-12-28 16:34:00,2646,"Well..since I already quit drinkin',dopin',smokin',fightin',speedin'...guess I'll just be a good boy & catch a monster Smallie in me kayak this summer."
284902,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-28 23:48:00,3761,I was the luckyiest 16 year old i think this year. I managed to catch 5 new species and gather up 6 PB's...Fishing a grand total of 83 days this year i was again very lucky and fortunate. So my years resolution is to catch a PB largemouth bass...not a pb bass for a certain lake(i had 3 of those) but a all around PB! With new gear and inspitation i am ready and determined to catch the big one!  Wish me luck everybody
284905,purekgw,2008-12-28 23:51:00,585,my new years resolution is to catch a nice big musky out of my kayak
284906,Leecher,2008-12-28 23:54:00,7832, Oh.... I forgot about that one.... catching my first musky would be the ultimate Thanks for reminding me Pure
284963,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-29 01:51:00,2038,"Catching a 7lb plus LMB on a scum frog with 75 feet of line out, twitch.... twitch .....Boom    Softwater can't come any sooner"
