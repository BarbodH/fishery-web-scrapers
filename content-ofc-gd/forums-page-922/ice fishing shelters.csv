284670,big daddy,2008-12-28 12:39:00,15,"I'm looking for a 2-man shelter than can be easily hauled by hand, if there is such a thing.   I looked at the Bass Pro 2 man huts, they go around 75 to 95lbs, depending on the ""thermal"" or regular material, and I wonder if they are too heavy to pull without a machine?  thanks & good fishing,  Brian"
284673,medmart,2008-12-28 12:44:00,587,Don't forget to add 30 to 50 pounds on that for your gear  Rob
284676,Woodsman,2008-12-28 12:47:00,1286,Brian: Yes there pull able depending on the distance & ice conditions. Don't forget you will also have loaded your fishing gear & bait adding to the weight. But if two of you are going you can share the load.  Rick

284836,sfgibson1,2008-12-28 20:54:00,6,I bought one of the BP 2-man shelters (regular one not the insulated one).  It's only 45 lbs.  Used it last week - fair bit of snow on the lake I was on but it wasn't too bad to pull.  I don't think I'd want to pull it around for a full day if there was a lot of snow on the lake but if you're going to stay in one or two spots it's ideal - lots's of room.  One drawback is that in heavy winds it may tip over if you don't have enough weight in the sled (but if your sitting in sled it's not a problem) It does weigh less than the Clam FIsh Trap.  CM
