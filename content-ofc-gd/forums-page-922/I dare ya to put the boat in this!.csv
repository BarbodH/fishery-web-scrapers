285130,POLLIWOGG,2008-12-29 15:59:00,835,I was up to the point (L.Ont.)yesterday around noon. Had to lean into the wind to walk and my hands were cold enough to fall off in a minute. Waves weren't real high but they were breaking everywhere.
285157,jwl,2008-12-29 16:55:00,1056,"that keeps up Chilli, and we can launch the boat from my driveway soon   , I am glad I already caught some respectable fish this December because I am itchin to get out big time....once this clears up and the river is green again the fishing is going to be just nuts.  specially since everything in Lake Erie, and the Upper River just got spilled over to the Lower River, so now there are about 10 million more fish on the Lower"
