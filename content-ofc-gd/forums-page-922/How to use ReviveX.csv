Needless to say, the weather got really bad after 12:00pm but we were stubborn enough to keep fishing in the heavy rainfall  While hanging my garments for drying, I noticed that my brand new Simms L2 wader did not have any 'wet spots' on surface whereas half of my Simms jacket looked wet.  wonder if it is because the DWR has been worn out and decided to get myself a bottle of ReviveX http://www.simmsfishing.com/site/revivex.html#  The instruction says to spray it on and tumble dry it .. here are my question:  1) Will the hand-warmer fabrics be damaged when undergoing the heat? 2) Will there be any damages to my Simms? 3) Can it be hair-dryered instead of drying machine?  Thanks!"

Waders are another story, you have to hand wash with a Synthetic Fabric Cleaner first. After the waders are washed and thoroughly rinsed, saturate the outside of the waders with RevivexÂ® or other water repellent treatment. Allow product to drip-dry. ""Set"" the treatment with heat using a blow dryer or iron (low setting), avoiding the stockingfoot attachment area."
