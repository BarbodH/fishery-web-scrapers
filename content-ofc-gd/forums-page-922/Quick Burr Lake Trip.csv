As things turned out my buddy had a medical emergency in the family and could not come.   I ended up going and got into a ton of perch but had to wait til the last bite of the day for a walleye. Was nice that the perch were being aggressiv today....made for a lot of running between my two lines, keeping me occupied as i waited for the walleye to show up. I was going to move but never did as time was limited.   Anyway, got a couple of nice fillets of walleye in the end, wasn't cold, and was kept busy. (i would have kept some perch as they were big enough, but i was noticing a lot of worms in the flesh around the gills and mouth.   All fish in 17 - 19 FOW on jig and plain hook with split shot sinker.     TONS OF THESE GUYS         ONLY WALLEYE FOR TODAY  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_2540.flv"">     Best wishes for the new year to you all."
