271705,JohnF,2008-11-25 14:37:00,3494,"Drinking is an interesting study. Some folks just plain shouldn't drink, but surely that doesn't apply to any in our little group of partiers here, and for those of you who shouldn't, and don't, my hat's off to you for your self-control.  Some guys are faithful to the end to one brand of beer or liquor and deviate hardly at all from their enjoyment of it. Others, as we've already read here, have one fave in the beerish world and one in the distilled world. Then there are those who drink only the cheapest lager when paying for their own, but suddenly become single malt drinkers when someone else is buying.  Me, I'm an alcohol slut. I go with whatever's available. At home I tend to favour robust (cheap but decent) red wines and Famous Grouse, with occasional side trips to the basement fridge for whatever brew happens to be there. Recently Lakeport Ale continued to miraculously appear and disappear there but I realized that I had gained a few pounds in too short a time and had to kick it out and go back to wine and scotch as goto beverages. Beer is great for young active guys but us old sedentary farts should stick to lower carbs and calories. Each Christmas season I seem to settle on a new fave from the liqueur cupboard. Drambuie, Cointreau, Sambuca, Grand Marnier and various brandies have all had their moment in the sun but once Christmas has passed they are relegated to the cupboard until the next December rolls around.  Cheers JF"

271865,Bernie,2008-11-25 22:50:00,3190,"In one episode of 'Cheers', Cliff is seated at the bar describing the Buffalo Theory to his buddy, Norm. I don't think I've ever heard the concept explained any better than this:  'Well you see, Norm, it's like this . . . A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first .. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.  In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Now, as we know, excessive intake of alcohol kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. And that, Norm, is why you always feel smarter after a few beers.'"
