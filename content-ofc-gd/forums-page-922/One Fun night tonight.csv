284457,richyb,2008-12-27 20:55:00,774,BOY OH BOY  is this going to be a fun one ... First off is a bit of a fish fry ... Then my 2 favourite hockey teams are going to do battle in the Habs vs Pens game ..... Then later on is the MAIN EVENT... UFC 92....  My predictions are ....   Griffin vs Evans ------  GRIFFIN Nogueira Vs Mir ------ Nogueira Jackson vs silva ----- silva by a big a$$ knockout Dalloway vs Massenzio -----  WHO CARES Kongo vs Al turk -----  Al turk Okami vs Lister ---- Okami ( this should be on the main card what were they thinking? ) Hardonk vs Wessel ----- Hardonk Hamill vs Andy ----- Hamill Chonan vs Blackburn --- Chonan Evensen vs Barry ----- Evensen  Should be a great night and some wicked fights....
284458,BillM,2008-12-27 20:56:00,17367,"Yup, really looking forward to this one!!"
284460,Terry,2008-12-27 20:58:00,14456,yup already pre-ordered the fight can't wait
284462,danbo,2008-12-27 21:02:00,2646,I'll take Jackson & Mir & Evans
284465,misfish,2008-12-27 21:06:00,29133,"    Ok with that said . Rich go eat your fish and rethink tis one...............   Kongo vs Al turk ----- Al turk  Are you dang joking me here.  Of all your picks,well except the Grif one (toss up),this one is way off.  Enjoy yer fish fry,may I not eat crow after this.LOL  Mir no way. Jackson is out to lunch."
284467,richyb,2008-12-27 21:12:00,774,yeah i know i know  kongo is a machine ... but i just dont like the guy .. he seems too stiff like a robot and he seems lost on the ground .... Only time ive seen al turk is for the weigh ins and hes a short stocky guy... likely knock kongo out with a flying uppercut because thats theonly way hes gonna reach kongos face.
284472,irishfield,2008-12-27 21:21:00,26272,Party's at Terry's !!!
284473,Terry,2008-12-27 21:27:00,14456,yeah but the main events are so late at night I pass out I mean fall asleep before they start....LOL
284476,misfish,2008-12-27 21:40:00,29133,"  I was thinking the same thing Wayne,but Im going to head out for a kick at a deer in the AM, with all this snow being knocked down.  You leave them floaters on today? LOL"
284487,Mike Pike,2008-12-27 21:56:00,1332,"I hear ya Terry!  The key is to pace yourself, Bud."
284527,Twocoda,2008-12-27 23:23:00,4130,FIGHT FOOOOREST FIGHT !!!!!! but i think he is going to come up short in this bout....hope he wins though ...
284544,Mark Kulik,2008-12-28 00:42:00,348,I'm all set for the fights too!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Griffin vs Evans ------ Evans Nogueira Vs Mir ------ Nogueira Jackson vs silva ----- I think Jacksons going to pull it off. Dalloway vs Massenzio ----- Daloway Kongo vs Al turk ----- Kongo Okami vs Lister ---- Okami ( this should be on the main card what were they thinking? ) Hardonk vs Wessel ----- Hardonk Hamill vs Andy ----- Hamill                  with MMA its hard to really predict but it looks like a good card!
284545,richyb,2008-12-28 00:43:00,774,  good luck with the deer in the am !!!!  have you seen many this year ? i was on a bit of a streak 10 days and seen 21 deer... the 21st sure does taste good
284546,misfish,2008-12-28 00:47:00,29133," He aint no boxer ya know bud.LOL He,s done. IMO.   Thanks. I have seen tracks,LOTS, of them.LOL"
284588,Twocoda,2008-12-28 01:46:00,4130,Although i think Spiders time is comming for a rude awakening ....i honestly dont think Jackson is the man to deliver it ....credit to both of them no doubt ...but for this one ...my money is on Spider...
284606,steverowbotham,2008-12-28 02:48:00,1800,My predictions are .... Griffin vs Evans ------ GRIFFIN decision Nogueira Vs Mir ------ Nogueira 3rd round TKO Jackson vs silva ----- Rampage by TKO 3rd round Dalloway vs Massenzio ----- Dollaway Decision Kongo vs Al turk ----- Al turk Ground and Pound TKO Okami vs Lister ---- Okami boring decision Hardonk vs Wessel ----- Hardonk TKO Hamill vs Andy ----- Hamill TKO Chonan vs Blackburn --- Chonan by decision Evensen vs Barry ----- PAt Barry by KO
284609,steverowbotham,2008-12-28 02:48:00,1800, Wrong Silva bud
284617,Terry,2008-12-28 03:08:00,14456,"see, they haven't started fighting yet and I am getting sleepy ...going down for the count"
284618,irishfield,2008-12-28 03:10:00,26272,What happens when you're old bud....
284634,BillM,2008-12-28 04:33:00,17367,They are trying to fill the 4 hours with prelim fights because most of the features have ended quickly.
284651,richyb,2008-12-28 06:41:00,774,well i sucked the hind end tonight !!!!!!  i think i only  picked 3 fights right... lost 9 bucks but got my drink on ..... so not a bad night .. so now im sippin on a nice strong rye watching some hunting shows on wild tv ....  man i thought griffin was doin good untill he doesnt remember getting hurt but he remembers waking up !!!!!!!!
284767,danbo,2008-12-28 17:00:00,2646,What can I say..
284810,dobee,2008-12-28 18:57:00,301,i won 80$ tonight.  picked the winner from every fight!  was a great ufc.. cant wait for mir vs lesnar 2!
284869,Mark Kulik,2008-12-28 22:59:00,348,"I picked one wrong-big Nog, I guess Mir was ready for him! I knew Evans was going to pull it off, while Forrest is a total warrior, I don't believe he has the natural talent of Evans, Rashad just seems better , stronger, and more confident with each fight!"
284875,richyb,2008-12-28 23:13:00,774,I have to admit i was very impressed by Frank Mir .. Man did he look fast for a HW ... I hope hes fast enough for lesnar !!!!!
