Going to be shopping at walmart and i'm adding 2, maybe 3 more Xraps to the box regardless. Walmart will not have every colour there, so i'm taking what is available, aside from the colors i already have what are some productive colors that have worked well with this particular lure.  Colors i have: Clown,gold,and olive green. A must color that i will get will be the purple ghost color(providing it's there)  Thanks for any suggestions  Looking at getting XR10's, fishing for small & large mouth bass."
284004,purekgw,2008-12-26 03:38:00,585,it all depends where you will be fishing
284005,forrest,2008-12-26 03:39:00,1032,Perch...   What size(s) are you getting?
284006,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-26 03:39:00,3761, Large and smallmouth bass.
284007,trapshooter,2008-12-26 03:40:00,1234,The pearl white colour catches fish everywhere I've tried it.
284008,purekgw,2008-12-26 03:44:00,585,i ushaly use the shad and always work or the gold
284010,jwl,2008-12-26 03:47:00,1056,these ones  
284013,Fang,2008-12-26 03:58:00,1330,90% of my fish come on purple back and green back minnow. I primarily fish clearer northern waters. haven't thrown them much around southern waters.
284020,Northhunter,2008-12-26 05:40:00,214,"I've always done well with either perch or the silver/blue with the orange belly. Gold/black too - but looks like you've got it.  It's supposed to be a decent pattern, but I've got a husky jerk in clown that's been in my box for about 5 years. I make a conscious effort to get it wet every once in a while, because I'm pretty sure it has yet to catch anything lol. I have one in bright orange (x-rap) that's been in there for 2 years as well. It has one OOS smallie and one northern to it's credit. That's it. The freakin' rock bass won't even eat it."
284023,profisher25,2008-12-26 06:19:00,185,"01 silver, or 02 gold... umm clown is nice to try out, n perhaps perch pattern.. though, if you want .. experiment with the hook colors.. replace the 2 treble hooks with Razor Sharp red treble hooks!"
284339,Mike the Pike,2008-12-27 15:16:00,3421,"Mike a must in your box is the pink X-RAP.Just ask my boy he has caught bass,walleye,pike,perch,sunfishand lake trout with this lure."
284350,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-27 15:50:00,3761," I have room on my ""Got To Get"" list for bass pro, if it there it's mine!"
284380,steverowbotham,2008-12-27 17:36:00,1800,"one thing you'll learn over time, which I learned the hard way, is that you dont need every colour out there.  I now stick to about 4 colours of each bait, and buy multiples of the same colour."
284388,pike slayer,2008-12-27 18:05:00,1177,"i have a tackle box with around 50-60 xraps in every size and colour. for smallies up here in the sault i found the #6 white/blue,pink,and clown xshad raps, and the #8 white xrap did the best. different lakes can be different. i suggest a few different colours and sizes and it can change throughout the day. i find xraps to be the best lures out there, they have turned my fishing world upside down. the only species of fish i didnt try with them is specks. take a look at the new suresets with the new colours!"
284413,richyb,2008-12-27 19:07:00,774,today i picked up my 2 first x raps in colour olive green and hot steel....  figured after hearing everyone talk so much about  them id get a couple.
