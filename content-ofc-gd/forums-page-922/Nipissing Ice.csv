285189,Bernie,2008-12-29 18:35:00,3190,Recent mild weather will have significantly reduced ice thickness since dec 25th. A young fellow that works with us here reported Wasi lake open in the center this morning. Talked to Mark from Anglers Haven a few minutes ago. He will give me a report as soon as he goes out to check things out today or tomorrow.
