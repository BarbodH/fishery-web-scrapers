284362,fishinfool,2008-12-27 16:44:00,366,I'm planning on going to Nippissing to do some hardwater fishing on the 23rd of Jan and I am trying to research bungalows in the area. There are probably tons of guys from this site who have had good and bad experiences with different outfitters. I'm hoping to get some of these experiences to aid in my decision making by the end of the weekend and hopefully I can book it tomorrow evening.  Thanks in advance guys and gals.  Stan

284515,mistyriver1,2008-12-27 22:37:00,600,Don't stay at Chilly Willy's..............all I will say from last year's experience....one bag for 6 guys for the entire weekend doesn't work.  Nuff said.   Give these guys a try...going back there this year.  http://www.icebungalows.com/
284529,Woodsman,2008-12-27 23:41:00,1286, Stan: If you have not booked already you may be too late. All the good spots will already be booked unless there is a short notice cancellation. Most places with good service book early and if you can book a week-end on short notice it's because of a last minute cancellation or lack of return customers. Mid-week openings should be available.  Best Wishes: Rick
284531,Bernie,2008-12-27 23:48:00,3190,Dennis at Icebungalows is a good spot as mistyriver says. Marc at Anglers Haven is also a good operation. www.anglershaven.ca Also new last year was Paul Toswell at the South Bay as well. sbaybungalows.ca/directions.php
284672,fishinfool,2008-12-28 12:42:00,366,"Well I went on the Lake Nipissing Ice Fishing site and South Shore Ice Condos came highly recommended by numerous members as did Rob Hyatt. I called them and as Woodsman suggested, they were booked up solid. They made a few recommendations and told me to stay away from a few places. I opted to go with Lake Nippising Ice Fishing Charters, their huts are on the reef and they will go out of their way to get you on fish where some of the others just drop you and you're on your own. Apparently they just took over this business in the last little while and are hungry for building a happy return customer base. Has anyone here heard of them or done business with them? Now I have 3 weeks or so to get the tackle together lol. I will do the big report with lots of fish porn (if I chose the right place) when I get back.   Thanks for all your help   Stan"
