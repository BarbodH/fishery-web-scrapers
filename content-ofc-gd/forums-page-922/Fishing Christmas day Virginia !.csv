284034,Slyatv,2008-12-26 14:15:00,45,"In Virginia Bay ..Lake Simcoe .. the first operator has hit the ice .. He Now has two huts out and Plans on a couple more SOON ...  I would guess so..  DAVE'S IS OPEN !  I went out this morning ...with all the intention of hitting the ice by 8 am......... so at 10:45 am I did as a matter of fact, finally did hit the Ice ! Man I love the WIlcraft ! Makes Life SO EASY !    That's where were going ... Would be a long walk !  But ZOOM ZOOOM ZOOOM    Lake shore .. Never took a step !    SO I heard there was a bunch of Slush out there ! ! I did Find spots that were even ten inches of SLUSH .. this is NOT everywhere just in the deep drifts..  SO we went out and set up .Took a while to get out as I don't use a gps ... Just go by that ""PLAN"".  I figured 9 ft of water ...    But those huts are way out there ! Bettcha they're on fish ! ! LMAO !  Set up here .. and We'll see ! ! was good to actually run an AUGER ...and need it !          Catch that .. a solid 8 inches of Black Ice out there ... This is VERY consistent as I find it ...  We drilled several holes today !  Yes there is Sleds Running around And quads ! But the ferry is still running .. BE AWAREof that area..  All Tucked in ..  Fishing !   On Christmas day !  Catching fish !   Only wanted a taster .. but still ..  managed to do that !    Scottydag and his Christmas smile !     The Mine LOL..  So that's the Catch of the day ! a few little sweeties !    Gotta love the ease involved in Fishing the Wilcraft !  Simple to move and set up ..  Just get out          Then Back Home ..No sweat ,no sore back ,no wet feet ,just a great day !"

284038,glen,2008-12-26 14:24:00,2641,They are calling for warm temps on saturday and sunday.  I might not be able to get out until tuesday or later now.
284042,Slyatv,2008-12-26 14:35:00,45,Oh I'll be out .... The Ice is protected pretty well up here .. And the Wilcraft won't sink Proved it a few times ...on purpose .in the summer.. test test test .. She's tight ! ..  Where's those Fish ! ?
284044,jwl,2008-12-26 14:59:00,1056,"nice going on getting out there Sly....that's quite the fishin machine you got there, we should be seeing a tonne of reports from some of you guys soon  You should tell Scotty not to look so darn cheery man"
284047,misfish,2008-12-26 15:17:00,29133,"Sweet ride there Sly. With the long wheel base,do you think it will have a problem with the drifts? Getting stuck on top of them?  Thanks for the report."
284051,Meely,2008-12-26 15:27:00,282,"Hey Sly..... How soon do you figure before ""Sly-ville"" opens up this year? Referring to the Whitey spot a wayyyyyyyyy out there on Simcoe. Is the train leaving from Salvation Army again this year?  Meely"
284053,Slyatv,2008-12-26 15:31:00,45,"Actually it's SMOOTH FLAT bottomed and has 11 inches of Movement/Clearance ...  With the tracks and the ski's I don't see any issues at all . Never bother to mount the Hardware for this type of weather but I will If I have any issues out there I will. !! So far a set of studs in the wheels and I've been good.. two people sitting on the drive wheels and the front just sort of glides over..  Gonna mount the Skiis for a while and check that out ! Fun ""PLAYING""with something new ....   Something to remember the whole macjhine only weighs 450 lbs ... SMOOTH bottom and Electric lift wheels ...   Usually just lift the wheels and slide the machine around ""NORMALLY""  ... just for set up ! I dropped it through the ice and it only took 7 minutes and WE were up and driving again ! ! This Machine has had all the tests done .. Now it's the learning curve of user error !"
284072,buckster,2008-12-26 17:03:00,530,Nice report and pics sly........ im not much of a perch fisherman but i sure am getting the itch to get out there......... come on cold weather and safe ice for them whities and lakers.  Good to see u posting on here!
284078,Radnine,2008-12-26 17:27:00,1538,"Would this by chance, be a FINFO-MERCIAL?"
284081,misfish,2008-12-26 17:33:00,29133,My pop was asking the price of this machine Sly? I went to the site and couldnt find it. Also where did you get it? Thanks
284083,Big Cliff,2008-12-26 17:39:00,6899,"So nice to see you posting again and that is one nice machine you have there. Just out of curosity if you do go through the ice, how do you get back up on top again?"
284104,misfish,2008-12-26 18:49:00,29133,http://www.thewilcraft.com/videos.php
284109,Big Cliff,2008-12-26 19:31:00,6899,"From what I saw in the video, the operator had to use a pole to push it, that is OK if: you have a long pole with you and it is shallow enough to use one."
284111,brickNblock,2008-12-26 19:35:00,598,"Great report Shane! Been a long time Bud.....How the heck you feeling these days....I hope a full recovery was the end of the story. I dont know exactly when, but I will make it up this winter for some whitely action for sure....Ill be in touch long before that day.. Its got to be a trade off though...I'd like to see you and wifey out my way on Quinte for some walleye action on the ice too.. Theres room at the inn now that we've renovated so you dont have to worry about returning the same day. Take care Bud...we'll talk soon Pete  BTW...seasons greetings and a safe NewYears buddie...Sincerely Glad your still up on your feet slaying them and enjoying your new water ride. Drop me a PM when you've the chance."
284132,Big Cliff,2008-12-26 21:54:00,6899,"Thank you for the PM answering my question, makes sense and looks good. Just had a friend over and he would like to know ""how much?"" and what is the delivery like on them."
284136,Slyatv,2008-12-26 22:41:00,45,"Well without this being a commercial ... But since you asked ...  The Retail Price is $10,495 U S FUNDS ! That is for a basic machine .. as explained on the website .. I will be glad to send an option List with prices off the Board to anyone with interest ! There are several options but the most expensive option is of course the Tracks .. This has yet to be even attached to see if it fits LOL... on mine .. I see no need so far ! Studded tires and Posi trak axle .. Please Just E-mail or pm me UNLESS IT's OK that I post this HERE ! ! .. I don't wanna wear out my welcome ! lmao !    Shipping is pretty easy .

284142,Big Cliff,2008-12-26 22:57:00,6899,"Thank you! I and misfish DID ASK so if anyone has a problem with you answering a question, that is their problem!  It is a little more than I can afford right now but had I known about it before buying my ATV I think this is a lot more versitile.  Thanks again!  Big Cliff"
