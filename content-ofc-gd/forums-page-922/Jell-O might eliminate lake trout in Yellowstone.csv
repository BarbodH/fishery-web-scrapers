Lake trout were introduced illegally into the park and threaten native cutthroat trout in Yellowstone Lake.   To find the best way to destroy lake trout eggs, Al Zale received a grant from the National Park Service.   He and his collaborators will analyze several potential solutions and recommend the best.   If Jell-O is chosen, Zale says it would probably be unflavoured.   He says workers could spread it over the fish eggs to smother them.   Zale adds it would seem efficient to get rid of the eggs during spawning season, which occurs primarily during late fall."

284417,forrest,2008-12-27 19:18:00,1032,Some dramatic and questionable tactics have been used to eradicate fish before. Has any fish ever been successfully eradicated?  forrest

284439,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-27 20:15:00,182,"Whats so bad about lake trout?, I know there not native there, what are they like eating the cuttys?,"
284440,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-27 20:15:00,182,"lol, I'm stupid aren't I?"
284442,forrest,2008-12-27 20:18:00,1032," You are talking about over harvesting, correct?  I have read about attempted eradication of Carp and Pike in water systems.  Things like poisoning the whole system and then restocking have taken place only to have the unwanted fish return in big numbers.  I guess people keep quite when things go as planned.  forrest"
284449,irishfield,2008-12-27 20:44:00,26272,  Yes Marcus... I was in Yellowstone in '04 and was told that the lakers are decimating the cut throat population.
284451,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-27 20:47:00,182,"THAT SUCKS!, well hopefully the jello will pan out lol, and they'll get rid of the lakers."
