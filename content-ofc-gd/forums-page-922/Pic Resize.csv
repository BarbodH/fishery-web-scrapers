I used to have one for my old notebook with windows  xp and it was as simple as a right click and resize,but I cant seem to find one that works that easy with vista.    Any help would be great."
284974,forrest,2008-12-29 02:19:00,1032," Try Irfanview.....its a viewer that has resizing capabilities.  or a full blown graphics program Gimp: http://www.gimp.org/windows/ I don't know if it works with vista. There is a computer section under ""extra resources"".  for rest"

284991,douG,2008-12-29 02:34:00,2693,"Use Fotosizer, of course."
