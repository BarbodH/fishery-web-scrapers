283995,irishfield,2008-12-26 02:59:00,26272, Nope.. dead center between Midland and Penetang Harbour Mouths. His window looks straight across at Present. Green ship channel marker is straight out from his dock.  Looked like a good 8 inches deep of slush. Not sure if it got the total melt down before the temps returned below 0C
283997,ciceri,2008-12-26 03:08:00,535,"o ok, i didnt enlarge them before, but i see it now.  the ice in the bay was about 7-8 inches, then 2-6 inches of slush depending where you were."
284118,krawler,2008-12-26 20:40:00,167,Have any fish been caught there recently?  i know it can be good at first ice.  ill be up there for the next week.  hoping the rains wont damage the ice too much.  if not ice fishing then im sure there are a few bows swimming the shoreline.
284167,ciceri,2008-12-27 00:22:00,535,"no idea man, should be some caught today, bunch out there today, i broke down in the bay today without my gear, i was sitting there for 4 hours before i got a tow home."
284170,irishfield,2008-12-27 00:26:00,26272,"Sorry to hear that Ciceri... but a good thing that didn't happen while ""puddle"" jumping...."
284174,ciceri,2008-12-27 00:33:00,535,"its not the first time, lol. This time its not so bad i think, i was riding and my throttle stuck open so i shut it down for a bit and when i went to start it, the knot in the pull handle came  undone and flew back into the recoil. Tried for hours to get it going with a strap around the clutch.  Last year the pin for the piston let loose and pinched my piston and cylinder.  Atleast tomorrow is gunna be warm and i can work on it.  Lets all hope the rain doesnt do too much damage!!!"
284176,irishfield,2008-12-27 00:37:00,26272,"Yep 9C tomorrow... I'm gonna use the day to get my floats off and my wheel/ski gear on, so I can start spotting some out of the way places to ice fish."
284178,ciceri,2008-12-27 00:38:00,535,do you fly around Penetang?
284179,irishfield,2008-12-27 00:40:00,26272,Not much choice when my strip is on Tay/Midland Point ! LOL  ..and no I don't live here .... (although many think I should !)  
284183,ciceri,2008-12-27 00:47:00,535,"haha nice, theres a guy in Penetang Bay with a few planes.  Find me any spots that look good for ice fishing?"
284514,ciceri,2008-12-27 22:35:00,535," so much for that, one dead clutch side cylinder"
280687,ciceri,2008-12-17 03:49:00,535,"For you guys that ice fish Penetang Bay, im wondering what you guys usually hook into around first ice?  last year i went, and i caught a 3 pound largie, and some nice sized perch, but this was January because i didnt get into it till then, but now i have everything and cant wait to wet my line.  Oh, and the bays frozen all the way to Beauseleil Island for those that know the area and were wondering. I snowmobile there so i know the lake alright and im always looking for new places to fish.   Good luck to everyone this season  Thanks"
280690,steverowbotham,2008-12-17 03:51:00,1800,usually some nice pike kickin around
280692,irishfield,2008-12-17 03:52:00,26272,"..and if you think that bay's all ""frozen"" you'd better keep that sled pegged to the bar !"
280695,ciceri,2008-12-17 03:54:00,535,"well, its never all frozen, i know where the weak spots are, i've been up there my whole life, so i've gotten to know the lake pretty good. And i like to skip the open part by the park with my sled, lol."
280696,Cudz,2008-12-17 03:54:00,2652,sandbars with current.  Get ya everytime.  Hope you don't have an Arctic Cat. Everyone knows cats don't swim.
280700,ciceri,2008-12-17 03:56:00,535," LOL! i know better than that, SKI-DOO all the way!!! for those of you that fish there, im sure you'll see me pull up and drill a hole and drop my minnow down while sitting on my sled."
280703,irishfield,2008-12-17 03:57:00,26272," Just trying to make sure you extend that ""whole"" !  By the looks of your avatar I've been here longer than you've been alive. The bay is full of springs. Fine flying at mach 1... but not something to stop and play on at this point. There aren't any huts down there yet for a reason."
280705,ciceri,2008-12-17 04:02:00,535," oh, by no means am i wanting to get out this weekend or anything. I usually dont ride it till i see people going from the Jug City gas bar on Champlain Rd. into the bay or out to B Island.   But a few people are already to go, they've got their huts by the water on Champlain.  And yea, im 17, but my family has lived up there for about 80 years or more, and the knowledge has been passed down"
280708,BassAsin,2008-12-17 04:05:00,806,hahah i was thinking the same thing wayne! there are times when the seasoned veteran can learn a trick or two from the rookie but its the other way around for the most part!  so theres a year old bull moose and an old bull moose about 10 years old standing on the top of a hill lookin over a gully full of cows.  the young bull says to the elder lets run down and screw one!  in a low deep voice the old bull replies with how about we walk down and screw them all!
280714,ciceri,2008-12-17 04:14:00,535, thats what i am hoping for.  Hopefully i can catch some lake trout and whitefish in Midland Bay aswell.
280719,irishfield,2008-12-17 04:17:00,26272,Ciceri... do you have a hydrographic map of the bay? If so take a look where sucker creek comes out near the N/E point of Tay Point.. out from it is a 60/70 foot hole. That's where I would start in a search for Lakers....they've got a nice deep hole to hide in and bait coming from the creek. I keep saying I'm gonna do it myself..but never seem to get there.
280771,ciceri,2008-12-17 13:06:00,535,"Yea i think we have a couple. I'll have to check it out, do you know when the bite for whitefish and lakers usually starts? i have no idea, i havent even caught one during open water."
280809,irishfield,2008-12-17 15:27:00,26272,Season is open... give it a whirl as soon as the ice is safe out there.
280840,BassAsin,2008-12-17 17:44:00,806,i normally do well for lakers in early january slowing down a bit then picking up reall well in mid march
280934,krawler,2008-12-17 22:48:00,167,"I fished penetang bay last xmas and did ok on pike, 2 in 6 hours, maybe not great but fish is a fish. I tried in january those holes irish was talking about off of sucker creek pt in 60-70fow, no luck but marked something on bottom.  actually caught a perch in 55 fow out there in mid feb.  ive fished midland bay and ive caught pike, herring, perch, lakers and whities, never know what your going to get but by no means do u catch fish in numbers.  i bought a sled this year so i plan to scour severn sound seeking pike, eyes and lakers this winter.  anyone keen on hooking up , pm me."
281002,ciceri,2008-12-18 01:31:00,535,"i thought some of you would like to read this.  Georgian Bay Snowriders. CLOSED. Volunteers are out preping trails.

281048,irishfield,2008-12-18 03:08:00,26272,Thanks fella... they seem to do that every year just when the ice is getting good.
281107,ciceri,2008-12-18 13:15:00,535,yea it sucks. last year me and my grandpa rode our sleds into midland bat to see the breaker and freighter.
281243,tonka-toy,2008-12-18 21:44:00,139,"Sounds like good advice ,but I would never screw a moose................again."
282225,HTHM,2008-12-21 04:54:00,4082,So this means that ice fishing in the area cannot be done on the 27th?
282229,irishfield,2008-12-21 05:14:00,26272,"Absolutely not Albert. Grain ship or stone ship always makes a trip to Midland Harbour this time of year to put in stock to get thru the winter... sometimes even mid winter they make a trip if lack of thick ice allows. Generally busts no more than a 50 foot wide slot from the main lake.. past the mouth of Penetang Harbour and on into Midland Harbour. They bust considerable ice to getting turned into the grain elevator or the sand factory.  You just have to be mindful of staying away from the ""slot"". One sledder found the broken up ice in the dark last winter and got busted up pretty good."
283684,irishfield,2008-12-25 00:48:00,26272,All I can tell you... is you don't wanna venture out on the lake now!  These are shots from 3PM today (Christmas Eve) looking out towards Present Island from my F-in-laws. That's not ice... it's SLUSH!
283751,motv8tr,2008-12-25 09:02:00,2587,"Also, the ships are coming in I think they said next week...things won't be safe for another couple of weeks I imagine..  Maureen"
283827,irishfield,2008-12-25 14:49:00,26272,Coast Guard is supposed to break a channel today. Sounds like both the grain ship and the stone ship are coming in.
283994,ciceri,2008-12-26 02:55:00,535," that looks like its around kookanack (spelling)  put yea, the freighter went in today, stopped by present, and the ice breaker did the rest to the docks, the breaker went back out around 7-730. the freighter will leave tomorrow im guessing.  Me and my dad went fishing today in the bay, didnt get anything but weeds and bark, lol. we werent out long, but i'll be back out soon."
