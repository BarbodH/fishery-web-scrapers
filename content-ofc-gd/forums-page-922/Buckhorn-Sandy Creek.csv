283499,big daddy,2008-12-24 11:04:00,15,"I have a question for those who fish the top end of Buckhorn in the open water season (if they haven't all fled to Florida!).  Can anyone tell me if Sandy Creek is navigable past the bridge which goes over the road at the north end?  I'm looking for property on the creek but I'm not interested in this area unless I can take my fishing boat (18 Ft Lund) out to the lake easily.  thanks,  Brian"
283526,Jer,2008-12-24 14:17:00,1426,I'm not sure...but I don't think so.
283542,kemper,2008-12-24 15:01:00,2232,Im gonna say no... I have driven over it past that point (I believe) and its pretty small and shallow)  Great lake for fishin though!
283593,highdrifter,2008-12-24 17:39:00,2534,"It's navigable with a canoe, but I doubt it's wide enough for the lund..  Great bass water around those parts though!  HD"
283704,Nanook,2008-12-25 03:17:00,565,"Last I heard, you will have to work hard to get thro' to Buck. Lake, even with a canoe. Its the Bull rushes y'know"
284665,big daddy,2008-12-28 12:27:00,15,"Thanks for the info guys, looks like I'll wait for spring so I can motor up there in person to be sure."
284819,GoneFishin,2008-12-28 20:08:00,349," The water levels will drop through the summer. They seem to raise and drop the water levels a lot , so I don't think it would be a good idea to decide in the spring based on the water level."
