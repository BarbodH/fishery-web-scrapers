284821,Roy,2008-12-28 20:15:00,13728,"We were talking about Boxing day specials earlier. I didn't really need anything and I didn't really feel like crowd fighting but, J saw a special on filet mignon that she wanted. So, off we go. The stuff was $4.99 a pound. They had them all sliced up etc .. so I asked the dude if I could buy the whole loins. He said yes. Ok so I got 3 of them and cut them to the thickness that we wanted and vacuum packed them. That was a good deal. Then, good ol' J says there are also lobsters on special let's see what they're like. There were a bunch of cookie cutter size lobs at $5.99 EACH. These were all 1 3/4 pounders. Good deal so I thought I'd take a dozen but there were only 9 so I asked the dude (a new young guy) how much the larger ones were per pound. He said, ""same as the small ones...$5.99 EACH."" That was a crazy price but I took some large ones anyhow and when the seafood manager came into sight, I asked HIM what the price of the larger ones was and he told me the same thing. UNBELIEVABLE!  So, I took 6 of the large ones and headed off to the checkout. I felt like that commercial  thing...""Step on the gas Ethel!"". Anyhow, here are two pics of the difference in size. The first pic is the 'cookie cutter' size. The second pic is the size of the large ones. Best lobster deals I've ever gotten. We had a big feed of them last night and left the rest alive to have tonight......I'd better call up some folks to come to help us eat those.   <a href=""http://s300.photobucket.com/albums/nn28/Bassigan/?action=view&current=DSC01455.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn28/Bassigan/DSC01455.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s300.photobucket.com/albums/nn28/Bassigan/?action=view&current=DSC01456.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn28/Bassigan/DSC01456.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  ps.

284824,Roy,2008-12-28 20:20:00,13728,"Yeah, I'm still hearing about that muskie/lobster story Dan."
284826,kickingfrog,2008-12-28 20:23:00,8333,"The lobster market has almost completely crashed. There should be lots of goods deals. Great for us, crappy for the lobster fishermen."
284828,kickingfrog,2008-12-28 20:28:00,8333,  Have you seen Roy??? I say that those are the 1 3/4 lb lobsters.
284833,Roy,2008-12-28 20:39:00,13728, Pipe down Canoe Crack!
284842,Squid,2008-12-28 21:32:00,1656,"Man oh man Roy, excellent score bud!!"
284849,Joey,2008-12-28 21:53:00,9122,"Sweet Deal Roy.  I just made my famous lobster bisque and I bought three cookie cutter lobsters to the tune of $30.00 total.  Oh well, it was good and all enjoyed.  Enjoy your second round tonight hon  Joey"

284880,Greencoachdog,2008-12-28 23:19:00,8163,At least the Lobsters are smiling.... little do they know that the garlic butter isn't for them to eat!
284884,chickenhawk,2008-12-28 23:21:00,612,mmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm........so should i bring anything?
284887,HTHM,2008-12-28 23:28:00,4082,With lobster the smaller the better taste
284914,douG,2008-12-29 00:07:00,2693,Smaller lobsters taste better.
284917,Roy,2008-12-29 00:10:00,13728,If you say so. I'll keep all the large ones for OFC company.
284918,irishfield,2008-12-29 00:10:00,26272,You just let them run around the house for the night Roy... or did you tie them up to your table saw in the garage??
284919,Roy,2008-12-29 00:18:00,13728,I lined them up on the couch and threw on a Jacques Cousteau DVD for'em bud.   As far as the the smaller lobsters being better. I think that was just a rumour started by folks who couldn't afford the larger ones.
284920,John,2008-12-29 00:18:00,2956,"Hey Roy, wanna buy me a couple of dozen and put them on the next flight west?  Great deal my friend. Even though the lobster market is tough right now they still bring $7.99+ a pound here for markets."
284922,John,2008-12-29 00:24:00,2956," We used to fly in 500 lbs of canners every year and split them with the rest of the street. It was pretty reasonable just packed in seaweed, no ice. They were as lively as if they just came out of the water. Tasted great but you needed about a dozen each.......  I still think that 2 - 2 1/2 pounders taste the best."
284933,Roy,2008-12-29 00:44:00,13728," Don't know if you have plans for the 4th weekend in May but if you're in the area, I may have a few 2- 2 1/2 pounders here then."
284966,John,2008-12-29 01:56:00,2956, You bin talkin' to someone?
284967,shane,2008-12-29 02:01:00,652,Put them in the bath tub and feed them bacon.  You can turn those 1 3/4 pounders into 10 pounders in a couple months.  I saw it on TV somewhere.
