283985,Skud,2008-12-26 02:42:00,739,"Went out from Gilford at 12:30pm today. Very few people out there, maybe thirty max.  All grouped together straight out from Gilford Rd. in about 15 fow.  The bite was on till about 2pm and died out until 3pm when they started hammering the jigs again. Very aggresive hits, swallowing my spoon right down every time. The average was bigger then the last few winters. We didn't use any live bait and three of us did very well. I just finished cleaning up a few dozen. The family will enjoy eating them for breakfast.  Will be out again tomorrow from 2pm till sundown. The ice is a solid 5 inches with some slush on top near shore but that will probably be hard by morning."
283989,Terry,2008-12-26 02:48:00,14456,thanks for the report  I hope the ice stays with the warm weather coming

284052,Spiel,2008-12-26 15:28:00,9065,....Good to see you out enjoying yourself Doug whilst I be stuck here at home....
284095,dsn,2008-12-26 18:18:00,1018,May I ask what was the ice thickness roughly? Might be taking out precious cargo this year.( 6yrs old neice). Would like to know its really safe before of even thinking heading out.  DSN  Thanks
284120,Laker272,2008-12-26 20:46:00,45,"Just got back from Cook's on the Gilford side. The ice is the best we could hope for. About 7"" of clear solid black ice. No drifts, a little bit of standing snow in places. The walk out is a piece of cake. Lots of guys out there. The perch were on real good."
284124,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-26 21:10:00,2585,"some very warm weather and rain coming this weekend so be careful out there, good ice will turn to bad ice very fast with these temps coming in.  cheers!"
284125,dsn,2008-12-26 21:13:00,1018,Thanks for the update Clamp-it and Lakers272. I'm just curious how it going for now. Won't be out there til January sometime.  Thanks  DSN
284182,Joey,2008-12-27 00:45:00,9122,Nice to see you got out there Doug.  Hopefully we'll be heading out there soon as well.  Joey
