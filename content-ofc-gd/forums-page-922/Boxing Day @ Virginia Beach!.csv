All I can say is    to the numbers.  I set up just about parallel to the huts but not further out.  I found a little hole that was about 10 - 12 fow.  Within one minute I had fish on.  Followed by another.  It slowed a bit and I got about a dozen keepers in an hour and through back about as many small ones.  Then the bite died off for about an hour with only about half a dozen in total with 5 of those going back down the hole.  Then a heavy snowsquall came over the area with some gusty winds as well.  Not enjoyable weather except......the bite turned on as the light dimmed.  I then got, in the next hour and a half, about another 50 keeping in total for the day 40 keepers and about 40 - 50 throw backs.  All from the same 2 holes.  I got two jumbos about 12 inches or so.  I saw two other guys out there who had some real hogs.  About 15 inches +.  Most of the slush had hardened overnight with some again being found around the snow drifts.  In total there were about 20 - 25 people out and for the most part everyone I talked to caught fish .  Hope the weather stays cool for you guys who are venturing out tomorrow.  Cheers,  Tony."

284436,tjsa,2008-12-27 20:10:00,1578,"Hey Tony, glad you are getting out, and having success. Haven't really seen you around this board much for a bit. But, then again, I am not around here much also. Read it daily, but just skim over most posts unless something really catches my eye. Right now, being off work until Jan. 2nd, I have a bit more time to read everything.  Hope to have reports with pictures starting sometime in January, if work permits."
