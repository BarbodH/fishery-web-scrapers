284752,rbaquial,2008-12-28 16:18:00,968,"I quit smoking almost 3 weeks ago. It hasn't been easy - a lot of times I've had cravings, but in the end reminded myself of 2 major factors...  1) Health 2) Cost  I must admit though, I did collapse to temptation last weekend - So, I had one. Best part was, after the 2nd and 3rd puff - I threw it out! Gave me an immediate headache, and I felt really raspy in the throat!! I'm soo glad I quit!! I hope this lasts as long as my last time (almost 4years!)  Don't PLAN to QUIT, just DO IT and GET IT OVER WITH!! It's totally worth it!!"

284765,JerseyDog,2008-12-28 16:54:00,190,"I quit last year on December 29th, so if I can stay off smokes for the remainder of the day, I will have a full  year off the smokes and honestly, I don't miss them a bit. In fact, once I got over the physical withdrawal - 6-8 weeks of hell, I never looked back.  What I notice with many folks is they still yearn for a cigarette and quitting for them must be next to impossible. You need to do the research so you understand that nicotine and cigarettes are not your friend and what you think the cigarettes do for you is actually an illusion based on your nicotine additction and nothing more. Once I finally realized that the smokes didn't do what I thought they did, quitting was actually simple (although again, the first few weeks are painful).  I used the following resources:  Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Quit Smoking www.whyquit.net www.quitnet.com (sign up for the daily emails!)  I wouldn't smoke a cigareete right now if it was my last day on earth and I used to LOVE smoking.  Good luck."

Smoking & tobacco  Quitting smoking    How to quit Quitting smoking may be one of the hardest things you'll ever do. But it gets easier with practice. Research shows that every time you try to quit, you boost your chances of quitting for good. Your chance of success is even higher if you combine quit methods like counselling, nicotine replacement (""the patch"") or other medications.  Quitting smoking is a process that requires careful planning, courage, discipline, and commitment. You can succeed by following this advice:    Four steps to quitting smoking   [*]Work your plan  [*]Celebrate your success    Proven quit smoking methods Most people who quit smoking use a combination of quit methods. Research shows people are more likely to succeed in quitting smoking if they combine several supports<a href=""http://www.lung.ca/protect-protegez/tobacco-tabagisme/quitting-cesser/how-comment_e.php#f1"">1.  For example, you can join a support group, and also have some gum or patches on hand to overcome cravings. You will need to find the combination of supports that works best for you.  Here are some of the most common quit methods:   Support groups/counselling Most people find it helpful to join a support group, get counselling or read self-help books. This type of support will help you understand what to expect and better cope with withdrawal symptoms. Contact your provincial Lung Association to find out more about support groups and programs offered in your community.   Nicotine replacement therapies Nicotine replacement therapies come in many different forms: skin patches, gum, sprays and inhalers. They have small amounts of nicotine in them and can help take the edge of cravings. These products work by slowly reducing the amount of nicotine delivered to your body to help you handle withdrawal symptoms more easily. Research shows these are effective in helping people to quit smoking, especially when combined with counselling or self-help.  More about nicotine replacement therapies   Antidepressant drugs Bupropion SR (Zyban) is a prescription antidepressant drug that can reduce the urge to smoke in some people.

More about medication to help you quit smoking   Unproven methods to quit smoking Acupuncture and related therapies: Acupuncture is based on traditional Chinese healing.

Some related therapies that have also been used as quit smoking aids are:   There is not enough evidence to recommend these therapies to quit smoking2. More studies are needed before we can say if acupunture or related treatments help people quit smoking.3. It's best to check with your doctor before spending money on these therapies.  Hypnosis: Hypnosis or hypnotherapy is often promoted as a way to help people stop smoking. There are different types of hypnotherapies - some are meant to lessen the desire to smoke and others aim to increase the will to quit.  There is no evidence to show that hypnotherapy works as a treatment for helping people quit smoking4.   Nicotine withdrawal Withdrawal is your body's response to being without the drug nicotine. Everyone who quits smoking should expect some withdrawal symptoms.   Common withdrawal symptoms:  Symptoms of withdrawal and how long they last are different for everyone. In general, symptoms begin within hours of stopping smoking and can be worse in the evening. Symptoms tend to decrease over the first 4-5 days. Some people have stronger symptoms than others."
282392,Bernie,2008-12-21 17:54:00,3190,"Been 8 weeks for me now. Quit cold turkey- nothing other than a solid determination to quit. Big cravings have now gone. And no more weird dreams about smoking (you were right on with that Daplumma). Was at our Christmas party last night and admit it was tempting but didn't do it.  When  I quit I was away from normal routine for a week at the hunt camp. Then a week of normal routine and back to the hunt camp for another week. It's a habit, a really bad one too, so a different routine really helped me. Drink your morning coffee at a different time or better yet change to orange juice. Take a lunch with good things to eat in it. Carrot sticks are a good idea. Do different things than what you normally do, like maybe visit the library or build something or go for a walk (you get what I mean). Support from friends (including here) and family are critical, really listen to them and what they are trying to tell you. They tell you these things because they care and do not want to see you continue something that is hurting you. Create yourself a definitive mindset. I AM GOING TO BEAT THIS!! And stick with it man! DO IT !  Am I ever happy to see this post from you G !"
282584,camillj,2008-12-22 00:10:00,1988, If you are serious ... I  mean really .. had enough serious ... butt the smoke thats in your hand right now out .... and put your lighter in your breast pocket as a reminder of your one-time habit. (I still have my bowl of matches and lighters right beside the dining room table) ... and 10 packs of smokes on the stove ... trophy's and reminders of my past ... I dont hate smoking .. I am just finished with it ...  Pull that lighter out ... play with it... and reminisce whenever you need to ... but thats the end of it... and by the way Congratulations !!!! Here's to a long healthy and happy life.     otherwise .. I wish you the best of luck...

283258,Squid,2008-12-23 17:58:00,1656,"Gerritt, I wish you the best of luck in quitting smoking. I quit on Jan 22 08 so I am coming up to a year. We are here for you as was everyone when I quit. Go for it, you will not regret it. I still have to buy a gift to myself for quitting but I will wait for the Muskie Odessey to but a new reel."
283265,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-23 18:13:00,10439,"Gerritt I quit, cold turkey 10 years ago and it was very tough but I managed. One thing that helped me believe it or not was Extra Strength Fisherman's Friend lozenges. I don't know why but the feeling when you breathe in seemed to get rid of the cravings. Pretty wierd huh?? I had my last smoke on January 10th 1999, so I will be nicotene free for ten years in a few weeks. Now if I could only get rid of the extra 100 pounds I gained since I quit!!!!!   One more thing, food and beer taste much better and you can smell again. Plus you find out how repulsive smoking makes you smell when you are not smoking any more. When someone who smokes walks by you after you have been off smokes for a while it smells like a dirty old ashtray walking by!!!"
