502605,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-09 13:02:00,2050,"Hey Gang,  My old man took a couple of kids out fishing this past weekend on Nepewassi Lake near Sudbury.  First off they absolutely SMASHED them with 38 fish caught, almost all bass with a few walleye mixed in.  All caught on Gulp.  Here's the funny thing, my dad get's checked by a CO who tells him that he's got a nice livewell full of SMALLIES?!?!?!?! and then goes on to tell him that there's no largies in the lake!    SERIOUSLY?  You be the judge! haha    Just thought I'd post it as I thought those were some funny lookin' smallies!  Cheers, Ryan"

502609,fish_fishburn,2010-09-09 13:08:00,1311,I think that CO should be sent back to school.
502610,jbailey,2010-09-09 13:14:00,866,haha thats just sad - i'm sure he does the same thing with pike and muskie lol
502612,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-09 13:18:00,2690,"Wow...pretty scary when our CO's don't know the difference. That being said I respect the job they do, and, believe we should have more of them. Maybe your dad should have handed him the ministry regs with the fish identification section highlighted!!!!"
502615,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-09 13:21:00,0,Maybe he meant small bass and that there were no big ones?
502640,jbailey,2010-09-09 14:32:00,866, valid point! but are you sure they aren't salmon? haha
502710,WeedLine,2010-09-09 19:54:00,322,Aren't those Atlantics?
