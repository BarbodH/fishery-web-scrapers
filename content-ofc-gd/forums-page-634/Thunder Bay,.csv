501800,cwpowell,2010-09-06 17:09:00,265,"So couple weeks ago, I went up to Thunder Bay to do some camping, I drove up with my girlfriend and it was a beautiful drive, I have never really ventured too far past about Barrie, so it was a new experience for me, as we neared Sudbury we started to see the deer signs start turning into moose signs, and as soon as we saw that we started to see the rigs start to appear with giant bush bars and until we got to the town of Marathon I had never really acknowledged the sheer size of a moose. My god, what a magnificent creature. Anyway we made it from Hamilton in about 15.5 hours after google maps took me down a gruelling closed log road.  We stayed at my Aunt and  uncles house in oliver paipoonge  and waited for my parents plane to get in and the next day we would head up to the camp on a lake off of the boreal road.  I'll keep it short. Fishing was amazing, and it was pretty depressing when we went out fishing when we got home because we couldnt go out and not catch our limit for the day up in Thunder Bay. My uncle is a trapper so he owns the only cabin on the lake, I didnt believe that till I saw it. Hope you enjoy the pics. I will post some more up when my girlfriend gives me the other camera.                      "
501801,cwpowell,2010-09-06 17:13:00,265," I had to keep this guy because he was hooked bad, the lake has a lot of  big pike, this one was about 6 pounds but you can find quite a few 20 pounders. The only fish in the lake are pike and walleye.          "
501804,cwpowell,2010-09-06 17:22:00,265,"Bald eagle. out front of his nest was a honey hole we caught a lot of fish there, also lost a lot of lures there too lots of boulder piles, that we saw after a little snorkelling trip to try and find my dads magic lucky lure haha. we threw the eagle a small pike every other day was very cool to watch him scoop a pike off the water 20 feet from the back of the boat. ive never really seen one in the wild these guys are HUGE birds, in the mornings you could see the little eaglets in the nest chirp chirp chirping.

501814,Gregoire,2010-09-06 17:55:00,1397,Those are some nice pics. Thanks for the report.
501820,nroadrunner,2010-09-06 18:10:00,113,Excellent shots. My fater in law also is a trapper here in Muskoka and he too has a cabin that sits alone on the lake.  They must have different rules up north as no one is aloud to stay in the trap cabin overnight unless they are trapping.  I believe even my father in law is limited to how long he can stay in the cabin when it is not trapping season.  Which sucks because my wife and I were going to spend the weekend with my six year old and do some fishing.  Some nice fish you caught  Ian
501834,Joey,2010-09-06 19:11:00,9122,Really great pictures.  Looks like you all had a great time.  Bet those pickerel were mighty tasty  Joey
501900,Bly,2010-09-06 22:19:00,1556,"Nice pictures, thanks for posting them all up.  There are so many beautiful areas of Ontario that I really need to start getting out to see."
501905,tjsa,2010-09-06 22:37:00,1578,"Great stuff, awaiting the rest of the pictures."
502031,corvette1,2010-09-07 12:05:00,1765,sweet trip congrats
502327,Sis,2010-09-08 12:50:00,24,"Glad you had a good time up here.  Dan and I travel those roads often and never fail to appreciate the rugged beauty of our little corner of the world. Hopefully you're already planning another trip minus the detour down the logging road lol.  Next time you're up this way, send us a message and we'll arrange a meet.  It's always nice to meet other members. Cheers Sis"
502331,johnnyb,2010-09-08 13:07:00,3413,"Wow...never been past Barrie, and you blow it wide open by going all the way to T-Bay.  Nicely done!  Looks incredible...I'll get up there one day   Great pics and report"
502333,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-08 13:17:00,2690,Couple of really great shots + some awesome fishing.  Got to love having a lake to yourself.
502337,adempsey,2010-09-08 13:56:00,1498,"That looked like a perfect getaway to me.  I think you should visit your uncle more often!  My first trip this year Google directions also sent me down a logging road.   Although, it actually wasn't that bad since it was recently leveled and [luckily] there were no trucks on it.   It's that logging road that goes to Sultan (connects 560 to 129), I am sure many here have been on it.  Anyway, from now on I am making sure the directions include only paved roads unless I have no alternative.  Cheers."
502346,limeyangler,2010-09-08 14:27:00,5204,"Great report, great pics....  I really must get up north one day too"
502368,cwpowell,2010-09-08 16:04:00,265," That is the road I am talking about. I drove it before they ""re-smoothed"" it! When I turned onto it there were signs posted ""Closed by police order"" And all I had were my google directions so I didn't want to get off the beaten path and get lost with no cell phone reception and not a person in sight! I drive a Honda Civic that has been lowered a couple inches and it was a Thunder Storm! I was not happy!"
502369,cwpowell,2010-09-08 16:05:00,265,"Thanks for all the replies guys, and gals."
502387,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-08 17:24:00,0,WoW! That looks like a true north fishing trip if i have ever seen one. That water looks like a fisherman's paradise!
502524,Leecher,2010-09-09 01:55:00,7832,WOW long trip    and what a beautiful place up there Great report and pics cwpowell Loved the stringers of eyes Thanks for sharing Leechman
502529,danc,2010-09-09 02:07:00,4677,The first picture I know very well. Candy mountain. 10 minutes from home and I've shot my share of grouse right there over the years.
502532,TerryC,2010-09-09 02:20:00,196,"Great post, thanks for sharing. I too will make it that far north someday.   Clarence"
