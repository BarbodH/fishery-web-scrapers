502276,Fisherpete,2010-09-08 02:21:00,1814,"Ever hoped that the weather was lousy on a holiday so that the lake would not be busy? Cool... rain... windy... perfect day for a muskie hunt. Patrick joined me at the last minute. We had a curfew of 6pm, so we discussed our game plan and headed out. We were on the water by 7am, and within 5 minutes, I had my first muskie! Just a baby ski, but hopefully a sign of things to come...   As my grandfather used to say when he let a small fish go: ""Send your daddy!"".        A few hours passed before I got the second of the day, another little fella around 25 inches... barely hooked, so a boatside release with no pics. Moved to another area of the lake and targeted a few other species for a bit, and got a few, but nothing picture worthy.  Around noon, we headed to my honey holes, and it wasn't long before Patrick was into a fish. She was feisty and put up a great scrap... decent length at 37.5"" but not very thick. Man-o-man was she an ugly muskie! I call ones that look like this ""swamp skis"", as they just look plain'ol nasty... must be some sort of bacteria in this area of the lake or something, as their fins, skin and eyes just don't look healthy. I have caught a few of these swampies myself, all from this same area. Patrick's was also blind in one eye... but it sure didn't stop her from feeding or fighting hard!            Moments after, Patrick got another... which turned out to be the smallest muskie that I have ever seen landed! CUTE WIDDLE GUY!!! Need a hand reeling in that bad boy Pat?      Pat got another hit at boatside moments later by a mid-30's fish, but she hit the blade instead of the hook! At this point, it had been quite a while since I caught a fish, and while I like to be an obliging host, I also like to catch fish... I put on one of the new lures from the muskie lot that I just bought from carponthefly, and moments later almost had the rod torn from my hand! WICKED hit! I soon escorted her into the cradle, and she measured in at a healthy 37"".        We had half an hour left at this point, and spent it at one of my more productive all-time areas... no takers. Oh well, it had been a pretty productive day, no complaints. With 5 minutes to go, we started trolling in the general direction of the launch, putting lures and gear away as we went... ZZZZZZZZIIIIINNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG!!!!!! The Tekota starts screaming off drag, and I keep that puppy locked down! I pried the rod out of the holder and voom-voom-voom the big side to side headshakes of a good fish shook my arms! She took to the air twice, and made a few drag-peeling runs, but I got her in pretty quick. 44 inches and heavy!!! Know what I am still doing 24 hours later? Yup, smiling!!! This is the fish I was after all day, and she shows up with 5 minutes left... gotta love it! She took a few minutes to revive, but swam off nice and strong at the end.                                Where-o-where could my 50 be... I will find her this fall!!!"
