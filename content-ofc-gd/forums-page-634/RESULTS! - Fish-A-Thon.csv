501540,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-05 14:27:00,2050,"Hey guys!  I have to keep this quick and simple because I've got a house to tidy and a date with my kids at Bayfest!  First off I have to thank all of our AMAZING prize donators, pledgers, fish-a-thon participants, my family for the awesome dinner, and everybody who helped with putting things together.  Thanks to Dan and Shawn for helping with getting the prizes and organizing things for this awesome day.  Our TOTAL for the day was close to $4500.00!  It isn't set in stone yet as I have a couple more pledges straggling in so it might be a tad higher than that.  We had more prizes than participants - the members of this board who made prize donations and companies from all over stepped up to the plate in a BIG way!  I'll try to list them all here but DAN and SHAWN if I missed any that you picked up please add them to the thread ASAP!!!!  Dave Mercer Outdoors donated over 30 Facts of Fishing shirts AND a lure and tackle prize pack! www.factsoffishing.com  Dixie Dairy Bar and Tackle Shop donated hundreds of dollars in gear! www.dixietackleshop.com  Knock Out Lures - a HUGE Spoon Prize pack!!! www.knockoutlures.com  Lloyd - U & Me Guiding service donated a  $350 value guided trip http://www.stevemorissette.com/uandme/index.html  Mike P.  from ONFC - Donated Musky Baits [emailÂ protected]  TJ - www.ontariofIshing.net Donated all kinds of cool stuff from shirts to mugs and stickers!

I was on the water at 5:30 a.m. and managed my personal best, 23 inch pig of a largie in the dark!!! (re-measured once I got the picture on my computer and zoomed in)    How's this for getting the hook out! haha   After the excitement of getting my PB largie wore off it was full steam ahead with the fish-a-thon!  We had an insane cold front, it was windy at heck, and we even had a little rain at one point.  Our fish-a-thon'ers toughed it out for the the whole day and earned their pledges!  I'll let all the pictures the the rest of the story!  Most of the gang...       Dave even made it out! haha                         Chad was my fishing partner for the day - good times buddy, you're welcome in my boat anytime!
