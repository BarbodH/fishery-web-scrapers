502096,10point,2010-09-07 16:09:00,165,Thinking about going to Dog Lake next year. Anyone here know anything about the quality of the fishing there? Through a connection of my Dad's we would get free lodging so I am thinking I can't pass this up if the fishing is good.

Your investment is very low, and who knows, may be it was an off year! Good luck. I hope you have better luck ! Durf."
502135,anders,2010-09-07 17:29:00,1168,its a great lake...im in Wawa and talk to guys that frequent the lake on a regular basis...been awesome this year
502150,johnnyb,2010-09-07 17:56:00,3413,Free lodging in that area = no brainer.  You gotta go!
502234,ctdd2006,2010-09-07 23:57:00,531,biggest pair of pike (caught back to back to boot) I can remember seeing live was out of Dog Lake one May 24 weekend with my parents.....mind you I was only about 10 y/o but those monsters remain in my mind today!

502386,pacman,2010-09-08 17:23:00,6,What time of year are you planning? There are excellent opportunities for most species - walleye/pike/bass/lake trout/perch and whitefish. It definetly pays to have a little knowledge of the lake for more consistent fishing as there is a lot of water spread over many bays channel etc. Dannys bait is a good starting point as he will provide you with some good info. I fish Dog lake every summer usually the end of July and have great success usually targeting walleye. In addition there are some giant lakers hiding in the deeper areas. If you want some general areas shoot me a pm.

Murray Lake and McMurty Lake I think they are called?  We only targetted pike, bass and some pickerel, and did alright.  We enjoyed the back lakes most.  If you have a chance to fish any, do it, no matter how small they are.  The one tiny lake produced some nice size pike, biggest at 14lbs.  Lots of water to cover, lots of exploring.  Free lodging can't go wrong..."
