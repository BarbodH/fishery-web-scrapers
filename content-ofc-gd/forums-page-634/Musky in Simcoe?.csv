502514,Michael_Brown,2010-09-09 01:14:00,411,"Easy boys.  Everyone has their own opinions but sometimes it may be better to not post it. Volunteering to support the numerous fishery projects that are ongoing in the province is a crucial element to the success of the projects. We may not all agree or disagree with the funding or policy but we should always respect the time, effort and intentions of these projects.  We all want quality fisheries for all species, we may just disagree how to get there.  I personally applaude anyone who gives up their time to help out by volunteering.

502554,crappieperchhunter,2010-09-09 04:09:00,2582, Pretty much how I have felt on the topic since day one as well.
502561,trophypikehunter,2010-09-09 05:23:00,89,I've done a little research on Simcoe Musky and between 1868 and 1904 they were commercial fished and after 1904 the sale of muskie was prohibited.  There was also alot of poaching in the Holland Marsh during the spawn which was difficult to control..  In the 1930's pike became abundant and took over..   In the last 4 years of Pike fishing exclusively in Cook's Bay I have caught a few hundred pike and this July I scored a 7lb walleye but have yet to see a Musky..  The picture shows 3 Musky that had been seized from poachers in the Holland Marsh the musky weighed between 38-42 pounds 
502641,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-09 14:33:00,0,Hopefully they start stocking pickerel too(in the holland)! But from what I hear? Pickerel are now being consistently caught all year on Simcoe by a local.
502051,jedimaster,2010-09-07 13:23:00,3472,Hey just wondering if there is any Musky in Simcoe? I haven't ever heard of anone catching musky on Simcoe just wondering. It would seem if the got a foot hold there they would get enormous with all the perch in the lake to feed on.
502059,MuskieWannabe,2010-09-07 14:02:00,79,There is currently a Simcoe Musky restoration program underway to help them regenerate.
502062,BillM,2010-09-07 14:23:00,17367,The MNR is working on it
502067,linweir,2010-09-07 14:30:00,202,"A couple of months, we caught a 30~32 inch muskie at south of Georgia Island. Sadly we saw another similar size dead muskie on bottom of lake. Water was so clear."
502082,Gregoire,2010-09-07 15:14:00,1397,As was previously mentioned there is a stocking program in lake simcoe. Presently musky fishing is closed on the lake. I'm sure more knowledgeable member will provide more accurate info or correct me on the following: The Musky that are being stocked in simcoe are the Georgian Bay variety. Apparently they spawn in deeper water than Pike giving them a better chance of coexisting with Pike. I think I read on a website that the natural population of musky was decimated by the invasion of pike. If you caught a 32 inch musky that is a good sign as they apparently can start to reproduce at thus size. What was the colour pattern of the musky (banded or spotted)?
502090,linweir,2010-09-07 15:55:00,202,Pretty sure it was banned.
502103,Terry,2010-09-07 16:32:00,14456,years ago simcoe/cooks bay had a great monster muskie population...then came bad water low oxygen and silting in of their spawning areas in the marsh area of cooks bay/holland river...they could get in to spawn some years but the smaller canals where they spawned in were drying up before the young of the year could get back to the lake......things are better now and I hope some day we have a great muskie fisheries again  I believe they are the same gene pool as the Georgian bay muskie
502134,muskeybugged,2010-09-07 17:29:00,282,I think.... Mike The Bass Fisher is at Fleming College which is heading up the restoration program.  Ruffling his feathers for info would be the best bet.
502141,Alumacraft,2010-09-07 17:33:00,139,Here's a link that will give you all kinds of info on the joint restoration project between Muskies Canada and the MNR  http://www.muskiescanada.ca/lsmrp/2007_LSMRP.pdf  Rob
502173,jedimaster,2010-09-07 19:40:00,3472,"Thanks, I think I do remember reading about it now. Not sure why it came across my mind, but its just one of those things.  Good to hear they are working on bringing them back."
502179,BillM,2010-09-07 20:11:00,17367,I was out with the MNR 2-3 years ago helping them net muskies on Little Lake and Gloucester Pool in order to use the eggs for the Lake Simcoe Muskie restoration project.  Let's hope they are making some headway...
502199,Musky or Specks,2010-09-07 21:37:00,2710,A put and take musky fishery similar to the lake trout and whitefish could probably be established but because of human impact on the bio-physical aspects of the lake I hold no hope of a self sustaining population.
502214,jedimaster,2010-09-07 22:57:00,3472,Its a shame because the lake is so big with so much baitfish I would think that it could really produce monster world record type musky. I mean look at all those big bass they could eat.
502217,Terry,2010-09-07 23:04:00,14456,"the lake is in better condition then it's been in 50 years  lake trout and whitefish are spawning again successfully , walleye are being found up the rivers trying to spawn again....I will hold out hope that the lake can sustain population of muskie and sturgeon will once again swim our waters too"
502241,Musky or Specks,2010-09-08 00:32:00,2710,I hope your right but I'm a negative nelly on this one.
502265,Tom McCutcheon,2010-09-08 01:40:00,627,Another part of the Lake Simcoe Muskie project is to try and establish natural spawning areas. The MNR and Muskies Canada are working together on this and hopefully these spawning areas MAY be protected from future destruction. We can only try. Tom.
502294,Sinker,2010-09-08 05:05:00,8692,There's enough gobies in there now to feed them too. Dammit!!  S.
502300,dave524,2010-09-08 07:12:00,4508," Grew up fishing Erie in the late fifties, it was good, sixties were going downhill. seventies were a complete bust, rapid improvement in the eighties, for 20 years now it has been a fish producing machine. I assure you Simcoe never sunk to the lows of Erie, I would be optimistic."
502312,Musky or Specks,2010-09-08 11:24:00,2710,Two very different problems.
502446,jimmer,2010-09-08 20:44:00,2730,"I doubt that Simcoe will ever be a put and take fishery for muskie.  They will protect them, even if the restoration project is successful, which they should.  I see a catch a release fishery or a 50"" limit when all is said and done. I agree that the lake can produce huge muskie, and I'm sure that's why they are attempting to restore the muskie fishery."
502449,Musky or Specks,2010-09-08 20:51:00,2710,By put and take I mean no natural reproduction. Musky have had access to Simcoe from Couch for a long time and have never managed a toehold despite all the forage available to them. Money and resources could be spent more wisely no matter the altruistic intentions.
502498,Ron,2010-09-09 00:40:00,1683,"   Here's an idea,  How about you form a club, raise money towards a project of sorts. It could be side road garbage clean up for that matter. There has been many volunteer time spent on this project, a lot of money raised by volunteer clubs and then you have people dissing the very chance of something being productive and benificial to the fishing community.  I am going to take a stab at this and say you don't want the Atlantic Salmon Project to succeed either.  Cheers, Ron..."
502504,Musky or Specks,2010-09-09 00:58:00,2710,
502505,Musky or Specks,2010-09-09 01:01:00,2710,Oh and I do support the Atlantic project but it should be scaled down to just one system. Say Shelter Valley or another small system install upwelling boxes and prevent the return of adult steelhead.
502507,Musky or Specks,2010-09-09 01:07:00,2710,And a put and take Musky fishery on Simcoe isn't a bad thing just recognize it for what it is. Most of the fisheries in the US are this. Ah if only we had wallop breaux.
