502469,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-08 23:02:00,0, I think tea coloured like the rest of the Kawartha's. Closer to clear than stained.
502471,sandmann,2010-09-08 23:06:00,51,"thanks JohnnyBass. For those that fish lower buckhorn alot, do you have better luck with bright colours (ex: chartreuse) or more subtle/natural presentations?"
502750,Bass Tard,2010-09-09 22:12:00,128,I use white/black/green/brown on lower buckhorn!
502775,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-09 23:36:00,0,"How did you do sandman? Honestly, every colour seems to work on buckhorn. But black and/or white seem to work best."
502793,smally21,2010-09-10 00:24:00,993,"i used a lot of twister tails last week on buckhorn, white worked better than a dark color. dirty water has light colored fish and clear water has dark, so really you should use dark colors.  the large amounts of sunfish and rock bass will let you know right away if they like your baits."

Me and the guys started throwing spinners, traps, and other faster presentation lures but the fish weren't very active.  We slowed things down and ended up catching 8 Large mouth all on white senkos.  Not the most exciting type of fishing but it was good getting out on the water.  None of the bass were super big, 2-3lb at best.  Nothing really worth taking a pic of."
