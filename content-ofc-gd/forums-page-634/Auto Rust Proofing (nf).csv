16644,lookinforwalleye,2006-12-28 18:00:00,4399,My personal opinion is that rust proofing is one of the biggest wastes of money going. I prefer to just look after my vehicles keep them washed and keep the nicks touched up and add a good wax.
16645,irishfield,2006-12-28 18:01:00,26272,They are on most plow/salt/sand trucks. That would suggest they have some merit.
16708,setomonkey,2006-12-28 22:06:00,872,"They are supposed to work, and they're less expensive in the long run than doing the rustproofing sprays every year.  Mike"
16713,fishindevil,2006-12-28 22:15:00,6254,"yes they supposedly work,but if you regualily was the belly of your car quite often at those coin spray's carwash it will keep the salt off just as good,just spray it down 2 times or more a week in the winter and it helps alot ,most people neglect the underside of their cars ,and the wheel wells and thats where most of the salt will do its damage,thats what an autobody guy told me,my car is almost 10yrs old and very little rust on her belly"
16956,jediangler,2006-12-29 14:25:00,1923,"I'm a Krown guy. Have been for years. I'm always driving older vehicles so I believe it really makes the body of the car last. They are the only ones who drill holes so they can get to all inside areas of your body. If you want it to last, start Krown as soon as your warranty allows."
16957,sologill,2006-12-29 14:32:00,9,"Just sold my 97 Civic. No rust proofing, just washed regularly including spraying the underside and wheel wells. Not a spec of rust on it."
17005,hawkeye,2006-12-29 16:46:00,162,The way they are building cars these days after market rust proofing is just a waste IMHO  I've got a 97 and an 02 CRV not a speck of rust. Just wash um every month or so
17049,Bernie,2006-12-29 18:45:00,3190,Been fixing cars for a long time..It has been my experience that some types of undercoating can be worse than not applying. Some types will get dry and harden and will seal moisture between it and the body surface. However the undercoating that stays thin like krown does is definitly/positively well worth the yearly application. last week we had a 03 chev pickup in to replace rusted out brake lines to the rear. Incredible!.   This would have been prevented with krown or rust check. By the way-I dont undercoat in my shop---Way too messy. By the way--Those electronic devices do work .
