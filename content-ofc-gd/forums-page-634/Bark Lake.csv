502094,vinnimon,2010-09-07 16:09:00,2593,  Bark lake near barrys bay?
502316,Stoty,2010-09-08 12:03:00,2910,"Yes, near Barry's Bay"
502463,Stoty,2010-09-08 22:44:00,2910,Anyone?
502464,bucktail,2010-09-08 22:46:00,1857,"talked to my buddie who has been there a few times this year and he said it was really slow, no patterns to give you....sorry. Most of his action came really shallow but that was a month ago."
502511,Oggie,2010-09-09 01:10:00,588,It must be really low because there is a well publicized battle going on between the cottagers and the whitewater kayakers below the dam that controls the level in Bark Lake.  The cottagers are howling because it's too low and the kayakers are howling because they don't have enough water to play in.  Ontario Hydro can't win.  I surveyed it for the MNR back in the 70's and there was a good lake trout population in the lake back then.  Dan O.
