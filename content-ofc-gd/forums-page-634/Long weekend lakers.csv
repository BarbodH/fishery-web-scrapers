502432,jayess,2010-09-08 19:47:00,187,"Went backcountry again this weekend. A fair bit of slogging with canoes and gear paid off in fish. Nothing big, but great eaters. Fish were caught over 40-60ft of water, with a few hitters at 30ft on the sides of dropoffs. We used 2oz-3oz weighted setups, one guy used a jet diver at 40ft. Mepps, wablers, and the usual suspects.  A shot of the lake    Our first couple of fish    Some more         And our rewards fried up with salt, pepper, garlic powder and butter  "

502653,jayess,2010-09-09 15:04:00,187," Hey cwpowell, I shoot with a Canon 40D. This trip I used a 24-105mm f4 and 10-22mm for wide.  I shoot raw so that I can touch up any exposure issues, but these ones worked out pretty well straight out of the camera. I add a touch of vibrance in some shots though to take away from what was otherwise very dismal, dull colours due to the wet weather!   We were in Algonquin Park on this trip, southeast side."
