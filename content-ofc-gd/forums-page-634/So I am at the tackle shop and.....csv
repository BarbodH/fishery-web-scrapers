I look at him and ask him what kind of fish he is trying to catch with marshmallows.  He tells me salmon.  I shake my had and laugh.  Then I ask him if he is flossing (obviously) and he answers yes.  I tell him that cigarette buts work just as well and that isn't really fishing.  I must admit that I did not know what flossing was until about 2 or 3 years ago and I never did it as a kid fishing on the river.  Now I know, I would never even try it.  Maybe people who do it don't realize it is kind of like cheating or snagging.  Is it possible if they were more informed that they would stop doing it?"
