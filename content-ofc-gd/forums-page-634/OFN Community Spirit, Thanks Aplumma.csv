502253,Daplumma,2010-09-08 01:19:00,1961,  I will be insufferable WHEN the caps win the cup..Art does not follow the Caps but insufferable just the same.
502256,Paully,2010-09-08 01:23:00,712,"I nominate this post for  "" Sappiest post of the year..""  Too many friendly people overload.... This is the internet people!"
502263,Roy,2010-09-08 01:36:00,13728," Actually, it's called a ""thread"". As for the sappy part, only you would know. I hope that none of this is making you feel too guilty."
502290,HTHM,2010-09-08 03:32:00,4082,Send it to me as well...
502305,brickNblock,2010-09-08 10:45:00,598,"From Lew.....""Art's a good dood for sure Spiel  Couple years back I'd mentioned that one of my favorite musky baits was a large jailbird coloured Suick.  Awhile later, we were all up at Lakair for the June g2g and Art surprised me with a gift of an 11"" jailbird Suick....that he'd custom made himself.  A good friend indeed !!""    EXACTLY Lew.... ..and exactly the very same lure I was fortunate enough to receieve from Art that same weekend, as well as 2 other suicks. Yes..ssssir...Them boys are one of a kind but lets not forget Spiel either....more then deserving for what that man has given and kept on given. Thanks to all 3 of ya's...Thoughts of U guys bring happy memories."
502318,aplumma,2010-09-08 12:10:00,6896,As some of you know most of the things done by Joe and I are shared he has certain people he is in charge of to keep an eye on and I have mine. We then fill each other in on the ebb and flow of our friends lives and that way we get twice as much enjoyment.Just like Hockey he is in charge of wishing for the Caps to win and I watch Martial Arts Contests. We both tend to stick to our specialties both in our business and personal lives it seems to work and if a few people get our names or quotes wrong their is no harm nor foul I am proud to be confused with Joe he is after all my brother.   Art
502326,Sis,2010-09-08 12:38:00,24,"Well said Roy!! I don't like seeing attitudes like that on here especially since our ""sappiness"" is a huge part of what holds us all together."
502334,Handlebarz,2010-09-08 13:17:00,3790,Good job on the lure hunt its nice to here these stories and Ebay is great for finding that special something heck that's how I found this place I was sick of looking on Ebay and searched Ontario fishing and sorry but your all stuck with me since.
502335,TJQ,2010-09-08 13:45:00,7806,"Dont be too hard on shorelunch, i think that comment was made tongue in cheek...."
502367,Sis,2010-09-08 15:51:00,24,I promise to play nice lol
502607,Rattletrap2,2010-09-09 13:07:00,1652,"Well, I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting either Joe or Art in person, there is no doubt in my mind that they are indeed a couple of the finest! Of course Spiel is a deserving recipient and all around good guy too!"
502106,Spiel,2010-09-07 16:47:00,9065,"Back in July I had gone out on Lake O with Fish Farmer for a little trout and salmon action and Fish Farmer had put up this post....  http://www.ofncommun...=1entry482072  In the post it was mentioned I had lost my fave down rigging spoon. TJSA had asked in the thread what was the spoon I lost and I mentioned it was a Bronte Flutter spoon, out of production I believe for some time now.  Well good friend and all round good guy Aplumma endeavoured to replace it for me, he actually found 4 brand new, still in the package Bronte Flutter spoons on E-bay. Two white and two black which he promptly bought and shipped up to me last week.  How swell is that. A big heart felt thank you to you Art (aplumma), totally awesome of you!"
502110,Roy,2010-09-07 16:58:00,13728,"That's very nice, Chris. Both Art and his brother Joe are kings in my book."
502111,capt bruce,2010-09-07 17:03:00,820,"THats what this place is all about (one of my favs too , the flutter spoon has been a main stay on my boat for years , still got a few stashed ,I bring them out on tough days , great minds think alike) we may have our tiller vs consol , merc vs honda , 2 stroke 4 stroke ETC. debates but when ya need some help , this is the place to ask , GREAT group of people . Aplumma your a class guy , in a world where class guys are getting harder and harder to find ."
502114,lew,2010-09-07 17:05:00,12766,"Art's a good dood for sure Spiel  Couple years back I'd mentioned that one of my favorite musky baits was a large jailbird coloured Suick.

502115,Sis,2010-09-07 17:06:00,24, See?  We have the worlds biggest family here It's things like this that keep us coming back!
502116,crappieperchhunter,2010-09-07 17:07:00,2582,Nice to come on here and hear of  things like that. One of the main reasons I'm still here.  Good on you Art. You just gave someone a priceless gift.  Spiel now we wanna see some fish porn with one of your new lures stuck in it's yap.
502117,Spiel,2010-09-07 17:08:00,9065," True enough Roy, both class acts and if you ask 'em they'll tell ya, Art's the smart one and Joe's the good looking one.....LOL That's how I tell 'em apart."
502119,Bly,2010-09-07 17:10:00,1556,"Art  Speil, hope you get a chance to use the new spoons soon"
502120,Spiel,2010-09-07 17:11:00,9065,"  Doesn't surprise me at all Lew, that's probably the same year he gifted me one as well.   "
502128,ontariofisherman,2010-09-07 17:24:00,52,friends like that are hard to come by.
502132,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-07 17:27:00,2690,"That is pretty darn, cool!!  Good stuff."
502145,MJL,2010-09-07 17:40:00,2427,"WTG Art  I never under-estimate the generosity and kindness of OFC members.  Earlier this spring, I was reunited with a certain magazine issue that I lost a few years ago, containing perhaps my favourite article of all time. A certain, generous OFNer shipped it from Hamilton to Scarborough for free   .  I’ve read it at least 2-3 times a week since it arrived in my mail box  . karma does exist and what went around definitely came around to the right person.    When I joined in 2005, I came for the tips but stayed because of the people (and Tuesday night chats )"
502147,SlowPoke,2010-09-07 17:46:00,2984,Those s.o.b's (south of the borderites) will never cease to amaze me. Good on ya Art; not only did you make Chris' day but we all benefit by your kindness.
502152,I'mHooked,2010-09-07 18:07:00,525,"I don't know Chris, sounds kind of ""fishy""   to me!  Didn't he just send you a message about the next rod he would like you to build with 'extra thick grips'  Sounds like a smart man ""greasin' some wheels"" if you ask me!   (Not that anyone did, or will)  ...and when was it you needed that new rod by Art?    By the way Chris, that new rod tip held just fine on my 1st 3½ lb smallie early in the summer!   Thanks again!"
502154,Spiel,2010-09-07 18:12:00,9065,"   LOL, I hadn't connected the 2 but now that you mention it....  I'm pleased that the rod is functioning for you, may your next smallie excede that by 3lbs.  "
502161,aplumma,2010-09-07 18:47:00,6896,Now why couldn't I be smart enough to figure out the lure/rod connection.... Thanks for the help IM HOOKED.  I found the lures on E bay out West now how they got their I have no idea. I can tell you that if you printed out this thread you would be spending more than the price of the lures. Even if they were much more it is still a cheap price for a friend who has welcomed you into his home and given you his last beer. Our thanks and gratitude for everyone who has touched our lives and we look forward to meeting you sometime in our lives.   Art and Joe
502166,Joey,2010-09-07 19:10:00,9122,"Art, you are a peach  You and Joe have made this community one of the best places on the interenet.  You're both so selfless and giving it just amazes me.  I'll always have OFC to thank for knowing you  Joey"
502168,I'mHooked,2010-09-07 19:20:00,525,"   Glad I could intrude, er...point out the obvious, I mean, be a pain in the   ,  (yes, 6½ lbs is definitely a goal worth working towards...just having trouble doing it from shore!)"
502177,kickingfrog,2010-09-07 20:02:00,8333,I'll add my thumbs-up to Art now as well.  'Cause y'all know he'll become an insufferable son-of-a-gun if the Caps ever win the cup.
502209,fish_fishburn,2010-09-07 22:43:00,1311,Thats simply awesome.

502223,camillj,2010-09-07 23:33:00,1988,Nice Job Art !  And thanks for the little PM you sent me 3 and a half years ago when I was contemplating quitting smoking ... it worked
502225,TJQ,2010-09-07 23:38:00,7806,They are definitely the fruit of the loom... I mean salt of the earth...
502239,mercman,2010-09-08 00:18:00,7054,"as a relative newcomer to the board, i have been in awe of the relationship most of you seem to have with one another. i spent part of the afternoon with Roy the other day and i felt like i'd known him for years. Thats how at ""home"" he made Barb and i feel. This seems to be the norm on this incredible forum. As i read the posts in this thread and others sharing personal tradgedy or utter elation, i get a warm fuzzy feeling, and i know that i am in the right place, and if the opportunity arises, i will lend a helping hand to anyone who needs it.  cheers to all of you, and Art, you are a gem of a man for doing such a thing.
