I will be using senkos and plastic swim bait for the most part, but i like to experiment. I usually carry a spare setup that can be used to experiment with. what do you think is the best idea"

502539,Garry2Rs,2010-09-09 02:36:00,1425,"I understand you want to use Senko type worms or soft swimbaits.  I assume you aren't talking about anything over about 1/2 an ounce in weight...  I'm not sure where on the line you want to use this swivel or what type and weight of line you're using.  If you are using a fluorocarbon leader and the swivel is just a connection, throw it away and use a uni-uni or an Albright knot to join the two lines.  If you are talking about a snap-swivel, it's not appropriate for these baits.  Just tie the hook directly to the line or to your leader.  Some guys use a swivel on Split-shot rigs and a swivel is part of the heavier Carolina rig.  These are rigs that you drag slowly across the bottom...However, I don't think that's what you were asking about. Garry2R's"
