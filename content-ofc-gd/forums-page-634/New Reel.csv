502085,Harrison,2010-09-07 15:16:00,2202,"Without having the book in front of me Terry, I would wager you bought that reel for less then a retailer here could get it wholesale."
502101,Terry,2010-09-07 16:27:00,14456, I would not doubt it but it makes me mad that we can't get the same prices here minus the dollar exchange   and  Sorry Joe when the going gets tough....blame it on someone else..you were my escape goat....LOL
502105,markiemark70,2010-09-07 16:46:00,158,"One huge difference that has not been mentioned is the difference between the experience of buying online, vs buying from a brick and mortar.  You know your reels and are comfortable buying a reel online. The average joe (and me) likes to go and touch and try something before they make a major purchase. Of course many people have no qualms about going to a retail location, taking up a salesmans time, trying out gear and then going to buy it online at the cheaper price. That is a pretty recent option that has opened up to people with the advent of the internet, but in the truest sense, people that do this are being ""dishonest"" (I use this term loosely because I am not totally comfortable saying that, but I believe it to be true. For example, you wouldn't walk right into the store during your fact finding phase and boldly state that you have no interntion of buying it there, would you? If no, then you are being dishonest)  The other major factor is that presumably the store is going to provide some service in order to earn the markup. For example, I don't have a store, but I sell and install CCTV systems. Last few years everyone wants to show me printouts of websites or Costco ""cctv"" systems and ask me to match the price. My standard answer is always the same: OK but when it breaks, you go up the ladder, take it off the wall, put it in a box and ship it to me (on your dime) and I will have it repaired and shipped back to you in 4-6 weeks. Sound good?  It is easy to undercut and sell things as cheap as possible when you never want to hear from the people again, and all you need is a few points on a product to pay for data entry clerks. It is much harder to provide real service and keep your customers happy by having knowledgeable staff and a retail location.  That is what you are paying for."
502112,Terry,2010-09-07 17:04:00,14456," in some cases your statement is true however  when I want a new reel I have no problem going into a Canadian retailer and checking out the product that I want to buy, I tell them up front I am looking to see what product I want to buy and to check on the price of the product and that I will be buying form the lowest price I can find.....and I do, sometimes it's over the internet  I do the same thing when I buy a new car, I have never bought with out checking out 3 different dealers........  and funny thing I bought my complete cctv security system online and installed it myself and if I have a problem with a camera I remove it and send it back for repair and install my spare camera till it comes back.......love my cameras, I might go for a PTZ next"
502307,alexmedic,2010-09-08 11:02:00,186,"I totally agree with looking around and do not think the ""Big Box"" stores will always give you the best price.  I was in the market for a new Okuma level wind counter and BPS wanted $84.99.  A little shop in the Muskoka sells the exact same reel with a full spool of 20lb line and 25 feet of flouro for $69.99!  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge supporter of BPS, just ask my wife!!  P.S. if if anyone wants the know the name of the shop, feel free to PM me. (I just don't want to be called a spammer!)"
502310,lew,2010-09-08 11:23:00,12766," With  the exception of a few folks around here, there's never been a problem with sharing info on stores that give good service and prices."
502434,aplumma,2010-09-08 19:52:00,6896,   Good point you are correct the more hands in the pie the greater the burden on price. Well in the mean time USPS is here to help you.   Art
502592,thefireman,2010-09-09 12:31:00,51,You have to STATE clearly that you want it shipped USPS and not UPS.  UPS always has brokerage fee's and import fee's.  USPS does not.  I have bought countless items on ebay and have been dinged a few times and every time it's UPS.  Most times even with the fee's it still cheaper (but not by much) Nice reel by the way!
502638,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-09 14:22:00,0," That's capitalism for you. So many hands getting a slice of the pie and by the time it reaches your hands, the price is outrageous. In the end your paying $50 for a $5 item....That's why middle men love capitalism. Money for nothing and your chicks for free(well not free.lol)...  Plus the US companies buy bulk and are rewarded for their large investments. If we(Canada) had one major company buying directly from the manufacturer and distributing to ALL the stores, the local baitshop store would be able to compete with the big stores, though there would be no incentive for big companies to buy bulk, but that's they way it should be.I guarantee cheaper prices, more sales, more production and more jobs."
502671,Terry,2010-09-09 16:28:00,14456, I always get them to send it USPS or I just don't buy however I have had some who sent it and UPS after I made sure they would send it USPS and when I contact them they tell me well I thought I would speed up delivery and send it UPS but don't worry I didn't charge the extra........and it cost me 100 bucks more when you pay the rip off prices of UPS and their license to steal for Canadians
502688,Headhunter,2010-09-09 17:34:00,5703,"Which is exactly why I will not buy anything that I cannot put in my hand before purchasing. Call me old fashioned, but for me topart with any dough, I gotta feel the product in my hand and that goes for virtually everything. E-commerce would go under in no time if it was up to me! HH"
502691,Roy,2010-09-09 17:45:00,13728,"Dang Joe, you gotta invite me over the next time you renew your hydro contract. I'll bring my camera."
502694,Headhunter,2010-09-09 17:55:00,5703,I use my tongue for that stuff Roy! HH
502700,Terry,2010-09-09 18:48:00,14456," I feel them first, then I have faith that the one I buy on-line is the same ..so far things have been as advertised"
502729,Duckie,2010-09-09 20:59:00,305,"count me in as another one who must actually handle the reel I actually buy. so that means online retailers are out.  its also easier if you do have a problem to return it.  I ordered a team daiwa tierra spinning reel from cabelas that was out of balance right out of the box (had a distinctive wobble to it which it wasn't supposed to have).  Cabela's customer service is  very good, so it was no problem, but still, it finished me from buying another reel without playing with it first.  the replacement was fine though."
503011,Guest 2uniq,2010-09-10 18:32:00,0,"buying from the US is good and all with their ""lower"" prices.... until you get them to Canada which will then be charged with customs and taxes. It's still cheaper than buying in Canada, but for some items (including a reel that I bought a couple of months ago) the difference in price is so little, that it may not be worth the waiting and return if there's anything wrong."
503016,Terry,2010-09-10 22:29:00,14456,"well I saved about 1 third the cost of the reel in canada with all taxes and shipping there was no duty... that is no small change,,,,it's like 80 bucks  and I have sent reels , cameras and others back to the US for repair and I find it just about as fast as buying them here and getting them repaired here.....  I wish the over all cost was about the same, I would love to buy in canada, but in my world I save a great deal of money buying from our friends to the south  any my buck stops here  look how everyone started buying vehicles from the US..so they lowered the price here..  and I started buying form the US almost 30 years ago when I started fishing bass tourneys..many lures, rods and reels could not be bought in Ontario and if they were here they were double the price ........prices have got closer on many products, but they need to get the same - + the exchange rate............  ..  I hope that soon all retailers/distributors will catch on and revise their pricing"
501206,Terry,2010-09-03 19:42:00,14456,"so I was given some bucks to buy a reel  the only thing I could think of was something for icefishing and maybe some UL fishing I hate the really small reels they sell for light line icefishing, I needed something just a bit bigger someone told me the Shimano Stradic 1000F Spinning Reel would be the perfect  and when I checked into it it was just what I was looking for, I mean it was exactly what I had in mind......dang, they are not cheap, but was within the amount given to me....I was reading about them on a USA website but the price was much cheaper..so I started looking around and man they are cheaper down there...... so I decide it just doesn't make sense to buy up here.....I really like to buy in Canada but..money is money  as I am looking for where I will buy it an Ebay auction pops up...oh yeah good price...Oh wait they have a Shimano Stradic CI4 1000F Spinning Reel buy now cheaper then the Shimano Stradic 1000F Spinning Reel in Canada..Ok what is a Shimano Stradic CI4 1000F Spinning Reel...I like it even more, I found an auction for one put in a bid  and wouldn't you know it , I win the very first one I bid on  today I get it delivered to my door $210.00 all in...210.00 bucks all in to my door.............how the heck can you go wrong with that  any ways I didn't know much about it but it does seem sweet and it is so light it floats I mean you set it down and you find it 6"" off the floor just floating there waiting to be used....ok not that light but , you hold it in your hand and with your eyes closed you don't know if there is a piece of paper in your hand or the reel...yeah light   so I am happy with the reel and POed I can't buy it in Canada unless I want to pay about 80 more bucks....  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=aaajpg.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/aaajpg.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
501214,Sandbag,2010-09-03 19:53:00,533,"Beautiful reel Terry...  Ya it sucks that you can't buy it in Canada for even close to the same price, but like you said ""money is money"".  Make sure you tie that reel to your sled when your ice fishing this year.  Cheers  Craig"
501215,MCTFisher9120,2010-09-03 19:53:00,3761,"Awesome purchase. That's funny about the price difference. Sometimes it's worth it to buy that way or atleast ordering online from a retailer like BPS or Cabelas.  Anyway, get that reel in action. A 2500 would be sweet"
501222,Bill Shearer,2010-09-03 20:23:00,456,"Apparently, the retailers, and etailers, in this country, have not heard that the US dollar and ours, is only a nickel, (5%) different. Even if you take into account our import duties and taxes, it doesn't come anywhere close to the reality!  I will buy Canadian produced goods, over the imports, when quality and pricing is the same, but on goods that are manufactured offshore anyways, how can there be so much of a difference?  Just look at BPS south of the border and here, for the exact same articles.  Just my opinion, FWIW"
501227,Duckie,2010-09-03 20:38:00,305,good catch.  they retail for $250 at Fishingworld in Hamilton which has competitive prices.
501261,Tybo,2010-09-03 23:01:00,1373,Nice reel. To bad you're going to break it.
501265,Terry,2010-09-03 23:07:00,14456," Oh, so you know me....LOL"
501268,Cudz,2010-09-03 23:12:00,2652,"Hey Terry, I have purchased 3 reels via ebay and they were all around the $100 mark.  Everytime I get them sent to me I end up paying duty and another bogus canadian handling fee.  How do you get around this?"
501270,Terry,2010-09-03 23:17:00,14456,"well I always do well having them ship them USPS and not UPS....I contacted the seller and he agreed  I have been real lucky often like this time they don't even charge me the Canadian tax......if it was UPS or others it would be duty, broker fee and tax......"
501277,Leecher,2010-09-03 23:45:00,7832, Hey Terry.... I sure hope it doesn't go POUFFFF next time you go out on the ice in your clam Nice real for sure dude Leechman
501577,cpguy29,2010-09-05 18:18:00,148,Money talks. I saved some coin buying a Curado from the USA. Will do it again.
501588,tb4me,2010-09-05 19:27:00,3295,I thoght toys were exempt from duty charges at the border...
501589,Terry,2010-09-05 19:31:00,14456,"LOL  this one was  I wish the wind would stop so I can give it a try, my cat is getting tired of chasing the lure around the house and I can get much of a cast going"
501611,fishhunter,2010-09-05 22:08:00,604,LMAO WONDER HOW IT WILL LAST WHEN HE KICKS IT ACROSS THE ICE AFTER HE MISSES THE FISH
501612,Terry,2010-09-05 22:15:00,14456, what are you trying to say there????LOL I would only do that if I spent 14 days on the same lake and never got a fish  but what are the chances of that happening......LOL  after all my names not Joe  oh...and the caps lock key is on the left side of the key board and should be in the off position...LOL
501617,fishhunter,2010-09-05 22:25:00,604,LMAO TERRY YOU DO MAKE ME SMILE
501633,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-05 23:35:00,2690,"  Quick edit- forgot to add, sweet reel Terry...would love to have one of those for ice fishing...JULI DO YOU HEAR ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
501665,Cypher,2010-09-06 01:26:00,20,Good thing you didn't get taxed! Good price. Ive got a pair of the 2500s and I find they are perfect for finesse fishing. You wont be disappointed.
501671,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-06 01:34:00,0,"nice reel...  i hate the disparity in pricing as well but this is what i've started doing...  if a local merchant stocks the item i want i bring him a printout of what i can get it online for with shipping and see what he'll do.  it doesn't happen often, but certain stores in town have come close to matching prices with shipping...  i'm gonna have to check out ebay.  i bet if you're patient you can get amazing deals like this one on pretty much anything!"
501728,aplumma,2010-09-06 13:13:00,6896,It would seem if the merchants can price match and make a profit then they are the ones jacking the price.I think that most of the time they are using the Manufactures Suggested Retail Price and I am sure they will not complain since it is extra profit in their pockets.Some of the merchants down here also do the same thing but the competition usually causes them to make deals as their inventory stops moving.In the mean time find the item down here and ask them to ship it USPS so far it has worked well for the items I send up North.   Art
501743,Terry,2010-09-06 13:41:00,14456," it seems the retailers I talk to, many tell me in the US most retailers buy right from the Manufacture, but up here almost product has a Canadian distributor, wanting a piece of the pie raising the price"
501746,lew,2010-09-06 13:46:00,12766," You don't need to look to the States for big price differences compared to Canada, cause we've got some crazy differences right here at home too.  I bought a trolling reel from JB's a couple years back for $385, regular price,  and the exact same reel was selling at BPS in Vaughan, the same day and also regular price for $515.......$130 different for 2 stores only a couple miles apart.  Certainly pays to shop around."
501750,Terry,2010-09-06 14:00:00,14456,you are right there Lew I always check 3 stores or more before I buy any major purchase ....the difference in prices is mind blowing.....for my life style anything over 80 bucks is major...LOL
502049,Headhunter,2010-09-07 13:13:00,5703,"Hey, how the heck did I get dragged into this? LOL Nice reel Terry... maybe Lloyd could borrow it as he seems to need a quality reel more than you and I! HH"
502083,Harrison,2010-09-07 15:15:00,2202,Inventory for CDN retailers simply costs more to buy from distributors here then in the US.  An example is the difference in price in CDN and US $ for books and magazines.
