501854,TennesseeGuy,2010-09-06 20:22:00,957,Nice.  50's don't come by accident.
501887,fishnsled,2010-09-06 21:53:00,3520,What a beauty!!  Congrats!!
501904,glen,2010-09-06 22:34:00,2641,"Nice fish but your already in the 50"" club.  Now your just hogging all the big ones for yourself   :clapping:"

501965,Leecher,2010-09-07 01:30:00,7832,Excellent job Jim She's a real beauty Leechman
501974,alphaalpha,2010-09-07 02:12:00,475,"simply awesome, nice work on the self pic!"
502003,fisherboy,2010-09-07 04:53:00,48,"Wow, very nice ski indeed.  I haven't had any luck this year. Only landed one that was only a few pounds heavy when targeting walleye..."
502025,spinnerbaitking,2010-09-07 11:39:00,1622,Very nicely done congrats Richard
502045,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-07 12:47:00,0,That a nice solid Musky! Thanks for sharing!
502046,John,2010-09-07 12:49:00,2956,Great job Jim....I heard the rumours. If it was anything like the conditions in July up there you did well! Congrat's.......
502050,mistaredone,2010-09-07 13:15:00,913,
502068,mistyriver1,2010-09-07 14:37:00,600,Thanks for the kind words folks.  Thanks for the 50 Terry  cwpowell- I dont normally weigh them and I didn't get a girth measurement on her cause I was trying to get it back in the water as quickly as possible.  She was a similar size to one I got their two years ago and it had a girth of 23 inches which would put it in the 30-35 pound range I beleive.  Jim
502076,Squid,2010-09-07 14:58:00,1656,Very nice fish there Jim!
502190,muskymatt,2010-09-07 20:51:00,2608,sweet....very nice fish...congrats!!
502204,Fisherpete,2010-09-07 22:03:00,1814,"That is a tank... congratulations, and great job on getting a decent pic by yourself - not an easy task by any means with a beast in the boat! I got a really nice one yesterday too (post will be up tonight) but I still am not a member of your club"
502336,johnnyb,2010-09-08 13:49:00,3413,Amazing fish -- that's gotta give you the shakes
502365,JimC,2010-09-08 15:47:00,86,"from one 'Jim' to another ... Congratulations on an awesome fish.   Getting that picture with only you in the boat is pretty praise worthy as well.  As a once (or twice) a year fisherman,  and only in NW Nipissing,  I've been lucky enough to be in on two (accidental) Muskie catches,  so I know they're around;   you of course,  just proved it in spades.    Well done."
502599,Whopper,2010-09-09 12:46:00,2174,"Can't really think of a more deserving person to have this happen too, Jim you earned it"
502614,jbailey,2010-09-09 13:18:00,866,nice pic! that things a monster
501757,mistyriver1,2010-09-06 14:42:00,600,The family and I just got back from our annual trip from the West arm of Nippising.  Water levels were crazy low and the fishing was tough for the week ....with one exception !!  Caught this big girl one morning on my own.  Self timer shot...   Centered.   She swam away good and strong.
501758,lew,2010-09-06 14:49:00,12766,You already know my feelings Jim
501759,Jer,2010-09-06 14:51:00,1426,"Nicely done, it's a beauty."

I'm leaving this Saturday for a couple weeks on the French - sure would be nice to run into one of these while I'm there.
