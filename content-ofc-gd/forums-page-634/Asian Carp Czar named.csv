502394,tb4me,2010-09-08 17:35:00,3295,its about time they did somthing over there..Lets hope its not already to late.
502425,aplumma,2010-09-08 19:31:00,6896,O great the cats out of the bag now.... you all figured out of plot to destroy Canada...O and our own fisheries. Some days I am still amazed at the comments here between the Two Greatest Nations on issues that effect BOTH OF US. When 2 nations sharing a border have an issue of this magnitude you will appear wiser if you read ALL of the information out their on the subject and then comment instead of reading just one sides information and snipping at the other side.

502443,Ben_Daniels,2010-09-08 20:43:00,435," As a Canadian/American dual citizen I agree that its both countries that will NEED to act on this situation to protect our fisheries, not just the Americans.  In all fairness I can see where people are coming from saying it's the Americans responsibility contain the problem seeing as the carp are in American waters first and gunning for our waterways which are Asian Carp free, but its not a time to say whose responsible its a time to act.....There sure is a lot of new Czars....Bed Bug Czar, Health Czar, Car Czar, Housing Czar etc. http://gothamist.com/2010/07/27/mayor_calls_for_bed_bug_czar.php I just hope the Asian carp czar has more funding than the half million that the bedbug czar has to work with.  -Ben"

502461,Billy Bob,2010-09-08 22:28:00,5865,We'll probably spend a zillion dollars preventing the Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes while some yahoo's do it themselves....
502681,John,2010-09-09 16:59:00,2956," By ""over there"" I think he means Asia Art...."
502693,aplumma,2010-09-09 17:49:00,6896,  Even by the wildest stretch of my imagination I'm betting not.  Art
502696,jedimaster,2010-09-09 18:05:00,3472,I don't care what the americans do to there water. We got the best water here. If they are doin somethin that wrecks my fishing its time to go to war. So if those yankee scum know whats best they better get to fixing this mess they created.....  MUAHAHAAA   JK of course. Anytime anyone puts effort into fixing a problem it cant be bad. Good work you southerners.
