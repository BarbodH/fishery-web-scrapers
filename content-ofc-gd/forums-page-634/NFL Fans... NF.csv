502732,jedimaster,2010-09-09 21:09:00,3472,So two comments. I am picking The vikings tonight...  And did anyone hear if Tom Brady was being chased down the road by a woman with a golf club when he got in the accident?
502734,snoil,2010-09-09 21:22:00,139,Vikes Lose.Nah she was throwing footballs.GO LIONS GO!!!
502742,tb4me,2010-09-09 21:40:00,3295,Go Vikes! Farve in the game tonight?
502745,danc,2010-09-09 21:44:00,4677,"Long time Vikes fan here. Yes, Favre will be playing tonight. And the Vikes will win IF Peterson can hang onto the ball."
502748,tb4me,2010-09-09 21:58:00,3295,Long time vikes fan here too! I miss the Moss and Carter days! some exciting ball thats for sure!
502764,jedimaster,2010-09-09 22:58:00,3472,"Fin fan here, but always liked farve so I am rooting he tosses 300 yards tonight."
502782,ctdd2006,2010-09-09 23:51:00,531,I pick the Saints and hope Favre twists his ankle!  Go Packers!
502802,Gregoire,2010-09-10 00:48:00,1397,Brees with a TD...at least I managed to get him on one of my fantasy teams
502868,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-10 04:07:00,932,Huge Near-Life-Long Packers Fan (saw home opener in 1993 @ Lambeau) and tonight was a good start en route to the division win.  Vikings D-Line and passing game looked pathetic.  (I wonder how pathetic the Green Bay offense will look on Sunday?  Maybe just 400 total yards this time).
