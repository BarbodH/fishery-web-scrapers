Cumulus rod felt fantastic too, hit some small bass and a perch aswell........ Someday, hopefully soon, I will post a beast........     "

502658,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-09 15:27:00,0,"  very true, got my new baitcaster reel coming soon so i hope to hit the waters and feed the beast that is hungry!"
502663,tb4me,2010-09-09 16:06:00,3295,"Hey I have a question. I have always wondered about thos yaks. Do they tip over easy? what if they do is everything locked down? Is the fish finder water proof? Im seriously considering purchasing one of these beautys! I have been in a kyak before but it wasnt the greatest. Went over and wasnt impressed..lol Hope you dont mind the thread hijack just alwasy wondered. Thanks ,Ron"
502727,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-09 20:59:00,0,"  This style of kayak (Malibu Stealth14) does not tip easy, I actually have a casting platform that I can stand and I stand often even in rough conditions. I'm sure if I tried I could get it to tip but Id rather not. U can get cable locks to attach to ur rods which is probably a good idea but I have been without for 2yrs. I slao have a 30lb thrust trolling motor that is great for trolling  (of course) and ithelps get around alittle quicker to the hot spots, this is a whole different story but u should definitly look into the fishing kayaks. Been having a great time!"
502857,justwannafish,2010-09-10 03:06:00,82," Go check out the Hobie website. http://www.hobiecat.com/fishing I bought the Pro Angler just over a month ago and have been nothing short of ecstatic with it. The thing is a beast. If you're in the market and want something that's specifically fishing oriented, this is the way to go as far as I'm concerned anyway. It's even got room behind the 'Captain's Chair' for a stubby lawn chair for someone else. I've taken three different people out on three different occasions with it and they all loved it. Here's a couple pics........I'm 6'1"" btw  "
502858,justwannafish,2010-09-10 03:06:00,82, And one more pic that wouldn't fit in the last post.......
