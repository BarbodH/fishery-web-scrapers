502664,hammercarp,2010-09-09 16:07:00,964,Imagine climbing into your tree stand in the dark and bumping into this guy.

502666,Roy,2010-09-09 16:14:00,13728,Oh they're armed alright. Deadly at close range.
502667,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-09 16:21:00,2690,"Holy ----!!  That is too funny!  Next they will be wearing camo, and trying to get the ""spring human hunt"" back!"
502668,tb4me,2010-09-09 16:24:00,3295,Thats awesome! What a great shot!!
502675,LucG,2010-09-09 16:46:00,779," Are these your photos? Where abouts were they taken?  But most importantly, did you/he/she drop the bear? lol"

502692,aplumma,2010-09-09 17:46:00,6896,Who needs coffee when you got that waitin for you.   Art
502722,kickingfrog,2010-09-09 20:43:00,8333,You know it had to be 2 days before the season opened. You'd swear the animals a read the regs.
502724,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-09 20:52:00,932,"Hahahaha, that's priceless HC.  Nice pics!"
502726,IndySKS,2010-09-09 20:58:00,134,Are you sure you didn't misunderstand the baiting instructions  The bait goes under the stand not on it.  lol
502758,rylan,2010-09-09 22:33:00,134,that would make for a very fast hunt---
502761,BUSTER,2010-09-09 22:55:00,1336,
502777,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-09 23:42:00,0,What's scary is I think it was tracking human scent.
502818,Dave Bailey,2010-09-10 01:26:00,1641,"I'm not against hunting, but it's good to be reminded that the tables can be turned, and that we are a part of nature too."
502835,archie_james_c,2010-09-10 02:00:00,618,"HA! Great shots. Don't think I could kill a tree'd bear, but if you're hunting for food, drop that sucker and call the season DONE!!!!!!"
