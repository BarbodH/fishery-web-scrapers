502030,smally21,2010-09-07 12:04:00,993,"  got a tutorial from MM and now i can post images. too bad i never take a picture of fish i catch, but i do take alot of bbq porn!    and the occasional boat pic - this was how every morning started on lower buckhorn lst week.  "
502034,Roy,2010-09-07 12:16:00,13728,There's some good lookin' food for you. Great looking morning shot too! Those chickens don't look too comfortable though eh?
502039,smally21,2010-09-07 12:28:00,993,they kinda look like a couple of hobos warming their hands by the fire - but i dont think that's what you meant by 'uncomfortable' is it?  it helps to buy them a drink before you put the cans in....

502052,Fish Farmer,2010-09-07 13:24:00,2234,"You just make me ""Hungry""- to go -  just had to throw that in. My wife just said, why doesn't my ribs and chicken look like that. my excuse is to her is I cook blackened Cajun. Man, that food looks good."
502098,justwannafish,2010-09-07 16:20:00,82,"Hahahaha, hobos by the fire! That picture looks hilarious now!  Lower Buckhorn is where I pulled that musky in my profile pic out of in august! That lake is RAMMED with smallies"
502113,smally21,2010-09-07 17:05:00,993,"its also RAMMED with weeds (not quite what im used to).  great musky, i had a lot of followups on smallies i was catching.  average smallie is on the small side, but ive had a few nice ones.  giant pumpkinseeds and crappy to keep us busy."
502427,aplumma,2010-09-08 19:35:00,6896,If those ribs and chicken taste half as good as the picture suggests I would be honored to sit at your table.   Art
502448,jimmer,2010-09-08 20:47:00,2730,Those ribs look awesome!!!

502606,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-09 13:03:00,0,Yup. Made me hungry too! Never targeted bass on buckhorn. It would be cool to see a musky nail one!
502621,bigbuck,2010-09-09 13:33:00,2449,"Looks Dee-li-cious!! Beer can chicken rocks!! Garlic salt, pepper and a bit of paprika for colour and that's it!! Gotta love cooking on charcoal, gas just doesn't give you the flavour."
