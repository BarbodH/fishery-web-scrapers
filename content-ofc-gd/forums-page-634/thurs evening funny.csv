He tells the rancher, ""I need to inspect your ranch for illegally grown drugs."" The rancher says, ""Okay , but do not go in that field over there,"" as he points out the location.  The Police officer verbally explodes saying, "" Mister,  I have the authority of the Federal Government with me.""  Reaching into his rear pants pocket, he removes his badge and proudly displays it to the rancher.  ""See this badge old man?  This badge means I am allowed to go wherever I wish.... On any land..  No questions asked or answers given.  Have I made myself clear?  Do you understand? ""  The rancher nods politely, apologizes, and goes about his chores.  A short time later, the old rancher hears loud screams and sees the Police officer running for his life chased by the rancher's big Santa Gertrudis bull...... With every step the bull is gaining ground on the officer, and it seems likely that he'll get gored  before he reaches safety.  The officer is clearly terrified. The rancher throws down his tools, runs to the fence and yells at the top of his lungs......  ""Your badge. Show him your ""BADGE""!"
