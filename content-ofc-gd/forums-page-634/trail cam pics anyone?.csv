502706,richyb,2010-09-09 19:25:00,774,Ive had the cams out for a couple of weeks now and ive got a neat buck hanging around. I call him crooked horn. These 2 seem to be hanging out together because ive got pics of the 2 of them on another cam a mile away from this location. I got rid of my compound bow this year and I have a crossbow coming in the mail. Has anyone else been gearing up for deer season?  any trail cam pics ?
