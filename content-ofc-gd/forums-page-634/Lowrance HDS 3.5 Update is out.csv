502466,Rich Clemens,2010-09-08 22:53:00,3131,Yup - Downloaded an installed the updates a few days ago.
502496,scugpg,2010-09-09 00:30:00,1373,I flashed the update tonight and I noticed right away it seems more snappy when I press the pages button to change what I want on the screen. Haven't got a chance to test in the water yet.  My biggest complaint is that the HDS's are noticeably slower than the LMS units so this is a plus.  That Sonichub looks pretty cool as well.
502522,Jack-of-all-fish,2010-09-09 01:44:00,53,Thanks Scugog. Just loaded the update onto my SD card. Will upload onto my unit when/if it ever stops freakin raining up here!
