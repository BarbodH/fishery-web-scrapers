502380,JMahon,2010-09-08 17:06:00,48,"Headed out for a few hours Monday night to a ""Lake Huron trib"", & managed only 1 salmon (11 1/2 lbs) & lost a nice brown.....lots of fish jumping!  Also, went trolling outta Port Credit last week, but only managed 2 'bow's, biggest about 6 lbs, & 2 small Chinook, with 5lbs being the biggest (I know, pretty pathetic in size, but it tasted good & sure beat a skunk!)  Maybe, ""barefootwader"" can post his pics of the bow's when he reads this!!   "

502389,bare foot wader,2010-09-08 17:26:00,1354," here's a pic the 1st bow (pic being singular due to camera getting soaked and no more pics that day)....second bow was a few lbs bigger  not bad for only 3rd or 4th experience downriggin...  nice salmon bud, would've been nice to be home a week longer, sounds like everything is running solid right now "
