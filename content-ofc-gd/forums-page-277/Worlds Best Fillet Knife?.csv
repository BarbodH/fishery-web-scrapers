811872,Fang,2013-10-09 17:33:00,1330,"Ron Post Knives, South River Ontario  I have 3 hand made knives from him (and looking for a few more). Finally bought a fillet knife last year and as you already posted I have used the old rapala's for years (Have 6 of them)  This was strictly a TO ME - FROM ME gift.  He does have a web site and sells his stuff at several shows through the year. He's always at the Toronto Fishing shows and does some of the hunting/trapping shows up north too. Best if you can see all the handles he can do. I pick my knife blade and then tell him what color/design handle I wanted. The top is a different type of skinning knife he's now making - was made this summer and shipped direct to my door for me. Gonna give it a test drive hopefully next week moose hunting  best to give him a call to find out if he might be doing anything local to you  "

811923,Ron,2013-10-09 21:59:00,1683,PM Mike P. There is a company near his way (Chatham) that produces fine quality knives. Outlaw might know the name of them too.

811937,Handlebarz,2013-10-09 23:20:00,3790,Yes Ronnie is right I know a guy down my way he makes killer knives. He is a hunter and fisherman and uses what he makes Ron has one of his knives my wife has two of them. have a look at his site it does not have every thing but you will get the idea  http://www.skipscustomknives.com/knives-for-sale.html  He also has a cool holder for the fishes tail for cleaning them its a neat thing to use I guess ( I don't clean fish)  If you go with him tell him I sent you he will treat you good
811949,Canuck2fan,2013-10-10 01:05:00,1444,"It is such a subjective thing. I love using cheap rapala knives because they ARE CHEAP LOL. I can drop em and I don't care. I can hand it over to some hack on the pier who will hack the rocks as he cleans his fish. I keep em sharp and they do the job.  However my dad decided he was going to get me a quality knife as a gift for my birthday a year ago. Well it got lost in shipping so he panicked and picked up a fancy looking Berkley set that had a sharpener and pliers. Long story short it sat in the closet until one day I arrived home with 30 perch to clean and I hadn't been to sleep in over 30 hrs (don't knock insomnia my friends you can get a lot done if you don't sleep). Having a major brainfart I couldn't find my steel or sharpener so I decided to open up the Berkley knife and try it.  WORST piece of crap I have ever held in my hand to ""fillet"" a fish, and I have worked in kitchens for over 35 yrs using Nella knives so I know crappy knives. I was like stunned at how bad it was at filleting way to flexible and the curve from the tip was just all wrong.... I sharpened it just in case and that made it worse somehow. Anyhow since I was working alone I decided to fillet all the fish just using my trusty but getting duller by the minute rapala and remove all the skins after.  As luck would have it I accidently picked up the Berkley and before I realized what I was doing I used it when I started skinning. All the things that made me hate it for filleting made it just about perfect for skinning perch. WHO KNEW?  If I ever get rich I will sit down with a knive artisan and have them make me 2 knives for cleaning fish. One normal 6.5"" or 7"" for trout, small mouth and walleye. Then a 4"" blade but with the exact same handle as on the bigger knive for perch. I don't get why all the manufacturers insist on matching small blades with tiny handles. Balance be damned I want something I can hang on to but with a smaller blade for smaller fish."
811991,spooner_jr,2013-10-10 11:26:00,193,"Canadian company, guaranteed forever. Mine got a knick in it, I sent it in and they replaced the blade for free.  Blade extends from 6""to 9"".  http://www.cutco.ca/products/thumbnail.jsp?category=130  It's the ""Fisherman's Solution""."
