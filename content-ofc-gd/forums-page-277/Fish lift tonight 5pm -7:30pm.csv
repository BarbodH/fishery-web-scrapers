812628,Twocoda,2013-10-13 17:06:00,4130,ask that question to the people that are responsible and exploit their incompetence with the timeline of why they have been delaying the project...i agree they shouldnt do anything while the fish are in the river but does it make sense  its on hold right now because of concern to killing fish??? FIsh lying dead on the dam apron or caught in the fence are hardly natural deaths..I think the MNR should be charging the owner of the Dam for violations to the  habitation/ migration of the salmon...wasted time and effort that so many have worked so hard to achieve a thriving salmon fishery....
812630,Twocoda,2013-10-13 17:11:00,4130,Sinker ......ill pitch the story to a couple of  outdoor columnists i know...see what happens if anything ....but its better to do something than nothing ...good on ya for being involved!
812649,Garnet,2013-10-13 18:32:00,2056,Sinker is right and they are having trouble hiring a contractor.
812712,Sinker,2013-10-14 01:51:00,8692,"Yeah, the original contractor had to back out due to time constraints(late start), and they can't find one now to do the job within their budget.  Its not even fisher people that are doing it. I'm not sure how valleys 2000 got involved, but they are holding the money. Supposedly.  This is the second season its been closed. Last fall, this past spring, and now this fall. I heard a rumour that something may happen mid-late october, but who knows.  Its a mess down there, that's all I know.  The sad part is they had good intentions. The new fishway is going to be a huge improvement. Most of the material is there already too.  I wish they'd just blow it up and leave it natural, but that's just my opinion.  S."

812849,FloatnFly,2013-10-14 20:35:00,1640,"was down there today.....what a mess, and way too many people fishing.   no construction while fish in the river....so that means it won't be done til next summer, since the steel are moving in now"
812968,ChasinTails,2013-10-15 20:29:00,90,"was down there today.....what a mess, and way too many people fishing.   no construction while fish in the river....so that means it won't be done til next summer, since the steel are moving in now why not divert the flow around the dam buy cutting trough the groung, tnt the dam and block off the diversion, problem solved lol"

811887,redpearl99,2013-10-09 18:56:00,259,does anyone know if they'll be doing the lift again tomorrow or the next day? possibly next week too?
811952,pidge,2013-10-10 01:15:00,438,"Sorry for my ignorance, but I'm not on the face book and never heard of a fish lift. If I were to guess from your short description of a dam nearby I'm guessing its opening a dam to allow fish upstream or physically getting them and releasing them upstream. Am I correct? Just curious. Like I said I've never heard of the term."
811954,Sinker,2013-10-10 01:21:00,8692,"Its at the bowmanville creek. The fishway has been shut down, so volunteers have been lifting them over the dam manually. They have a pulley system set up where they net the fish, put them in a bag, and hook them on the pulley. They're released upstream. I've helped a couple nights down there now. Its quite a mess, they need all the help they can get.  S."

811979,gogu392,2013-10-10 04:16:00,142,How many decades do they need to build that ladder for fish?
811985,fishindevil,2013-10-10 07:20:00,6254,The fish ladder is there and been in place for many years !!!! For some reason it's not in service and needs repairs !!!! So they are doing it manually like sinker said !! And yes it's at the old good-year dam just a mile south of hwy 2 in bommanville can't miss the place !!!!
811986,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-10-10 08:36:00,83,These are a few videos I've taken over the last 2 years of the Bowmanville Dam. There are a lot of good people trying to get this this new ladder built.

812005,mattybculp,2013-10-10 13:07:00,388,Is this happening again tonight ? I Could try to make it down and do my part. Just waders and a large net needed ?
812010,Christopheraaron,2013-10-10 13:31:00,3525,"I'd like to help too, when is it happening again?"
812038,esoxansteel,2013-10-10 17:45:00,1307,"1.1 billion would have built a decent fish lift, or at least repaired the broken one."
812067,Sinker,2013-10-10 19:43:00,8692,"The fish ladder was never broken, it just wasn't big enough for the chinooks.  I think this valleys 2000 group is screwing with the money for the ladder myself, but I could be wrong.  Its sure taking a long time to get anything done, and nobody seems to have a straight answer on whats happening.   S."
812071,ChasinTails,2013-10-10 19:53:00,90,"how can i help and is it any other day, id like to know as i frequent that river"
812094,fishindevil,2013-10-10 22:26:00,6254,It seems like they are doing it when they can get all the volenteers together ?? I believe there is bomanville steelhead members on this site so they would know I was just passing the info on I seen on Facebook as I know Pete seto so I thought it was a good thing to pass on to our great bunch of people here !!! I hope they keep lifting there's a ton of fish there
812097,Christopheraaron,2013-10-10 22:28:00,3525,"I don't know why it took them so long to get started, there's obviously a tonne of people wanting to help, they should have been doing this since August when the first big runs came in!"
812099,pidge,2013-10-10 22:35:00,438,Good description Sinker. Thanks.
812105,Garnet,2013-10-10 23:02:00,2056,"The old fish ladder was installed in 1988 and never was intended for salmon. At that time MNR would not admit that the Chinook could or would reproduce in any of our rivers.  We were also limited to 25% of summer mean flow by Goodyear. They were still using the dam for cooling.  As you can see the old fish ladder was wildly successful.  Looks like some bad planning shutting the old ladder down before  the control channel was ready, good thing the right guy showed up with the right plan or we really would have a disaster."
812120,FloatnFly,2013-10-10 23:51:00,1640,"I don't know why it took them so long to get started, there's obviously a tonne of people wanting to help, they should have been doing this since August when the first big runs came in!   they have been, just 2 seasons of manually lifting fish is a pain in the arse cause of a little red tape"
812156,Christopheraaron,2013-10-11 01:23:00,3525,"Sorry I know that they did a couple lifts early, but it still seems that they could have saved a lot more of those fish. Of course this shouldn't be their responsibility, I can't imagine it takes that long to put up a ladder"
812195,FloatnFly,2013-10-11 11:42:00,1640,"the ladder is there, theres  just red tape preventing it from being finished"
812257,Sinker,2013-10-11 16:23:00,8692,"Chris, they've been lifting fish since late august as often as possible. I think almost 10,000 fish have been lifted so far.  S."
812260,ChasinTails,2013-10-11 16:29:00,90,"down with the tape i say. what is it anyway like a ribbon to cut lol just open the dam, dam already"
812261,Sinker,2013-10-11 16:31:00,8692,"They have the water diverted from the fishway. Its essentially dry right now.  Valleys 2000 is the group responsible for most of this, contact them and raise hell.  S."

812351,Twocoda,2013-10-12 02:20:00,4130,There you go boys...find out who the private owner of the dam is ....start protesting ...get involved...make some noise...there are alot of good videos in this thread to shock the everyday average people ....put faces to the problem and put more faces to the people with the solutions...this is total Bull in my opinion...for all the people that volunteer...Good on ya !!!
