Had 4 fish interested in the fly, 3 on figuer 8s at boatside, and 1 large fish picked up the fly about 65 ft out, and swam with the fly towards the boat, i tried strip setting 5 times but the fish was always moving towards the boat faster then the sets, and basically never even felt the attempted hook sets, and when the fish got to the boat just spit the fly, with the clear water i could see the hole show, which was cool too see, tomorrows another day, with a front coming through, and another go at it,"

Good luck   Absolutely a workout, which is another reason to give the conventional tackle a try, just to give your arms a rest. Recently the fish have shown a preference for the smaller 7 to 8 inch streamers,(easier on the arms) instead of the tandem hook 14 inchers i make as well. For anyone interested in this, Icelandic sheep hair is really soft and pulses like maraboo steelhead flies when twitched, over the standard course Yak hair i usually use to get the 10 to 14 inch streamers, much cheaper on the wallet then the sometimes hard to get Yak hair as well."

I do small water though....rivers.  We should consider a musky trip swap next season man!  I'd have to agree with the icelandic sheep material.  Nothing better.  I posted this a while back, but here it is again just for kicks....  "
