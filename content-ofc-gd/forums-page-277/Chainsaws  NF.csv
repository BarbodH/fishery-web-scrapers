810700,woodenboater,2013-10-03 11:52:00,2277,"I'd actually use a nose guard if working in thick brush or limbing but remove it if things are wide open and I might need to plunge or bore. I know some people look down on them but if can minimize kick back, I'm cool with it."

810846,Bernie,2013-10-04 00:14:00,3190,"Hey Art, I was honest. I thought the Poulan I bought sucked. Ha!"
810849,jedimaster,2013-10-04 00:51:00,3472,"I have a poulan, and have had it now for about 6 years and I use it every year when I go hunting to cut downed trees and clear lanes etc... I haven't ever had a problem with it. Its pretty light and as long as you have a sharp chain it cuts. My cousin has a Stihl and its a far better machine but I haven't seen anything his could cut through that mind couldn't. Just depends how much you want to spend. If you got the coin Stihl and you can't go wrong. the anti vibe is awesome. Far better than any Husq or Echo I have used. Mind you the echo's and Husq are better than poulan, but really, mine I prime it 5 squirts, pull the choke out all the way give it three yanks push the choke in half way and it starts every time. Even after sitting for a year waiting for hunting season."
810854,Sinker,2013-10-04 01:37:00,8692,"Sure, any chainsaw will clear trails or brush, but when your felling. Trees, bucking them, and sawing cord after cord of hardwood, those lower end saws will let you down.  If your just going to use it occasionally for light duty, but a cheapie. If you plan to use it a lot, get one that will last, or you will just pay less twice, rather than more once. You do get what you pay for.  S."
810877,Rod Caster,2013-10-04 11:30:00,5784,"Oh, and don't bother with a used chainsaw. I bought a high-end used one and turned out to be a potential money pit so I bought new. Chainsaws are just one of those things you dont' buy used...unless you can test it out for free for a week haha."
810950,aplumma,2013-10-04 18:49:00,6896,"We have 3 saws 2 husq 1 stihl all have a specific job. One husq 268 has a 20"" bar and a professional chain (no anti kickbath teeth full on cutting) it flat eats wood as fast as you can feed it. The saw is heavy but with the torque and high RPM's it processes large wood easily. The stihl 260 has the same chain and bar and while it runs as well it has 20% less torque (less CC motor also) but is lighter and is easier to fell trees with. The last husq is a 55 with 14"" bar which is light and high RPM's and will limb out trees all day without being to heavy. None of them are the perfect saw...all of them will cut down a tree... each one has it's shining point's. The less you spend on a saw the less saw you will get. I have seen saws that will not pull thru wood with a good sharp chain because it has little torque. Once it dulls down the RPM's pick up and it is not ripping chunks out of the tree but making rough sawdust. It sounds impressive and the job gets done and you are happy because it has cut the wood. One day you will see a high end torque ladened motor pulling huge chips and flying thru the logs and you will see the difference. Spend as much as you can on quality and take good care of it and it will last a very long time.   Art"

812207,woodenboater,2013-10-11 13:32:00,2277,"Well time for an update.  Ended up getting a Husky 435 with 18"". Came down to this or the Stihl 235/250. Both had great features but a few details (access to sparky and air filter, side tensioner etc) on the Husqvarna tipped the scale. But honestly, any of the choices mentioned would have worked so it was kinda tough deciding.  Picking it up today after it's tuned up by the shop. Will be getting a bar that can take a nose guard for brushy/tight spaces. Grab some chaps, take a safety course and good to go.   thanks for all the advice, it helped immensely !  WB"
812219,Rod Caster,2013-10-11 14:21:00,5784,"Sweet. You may find the 18"" bar is a bit big for most of your uses. Unless your felling huge trees, I'd go to a 16"" bar. More control, less weight, more power. Just a thought; the shop will exchange to a 16"" for free."
812221,woodenboater,2013-10-11 14:25:00,2277,"Was planning on alternating between 2 bars, depending on the task at hand. Looking at getting the 13"" or 14""with a low profile chain."
812225,Rod Caster,2013-10-11 14:41:00,5784,"Nice, that'll work.  I'd like the same setup, but a 70cc saw isn't good for limbing no matter what bar is on it  I need a small echo for that."
812228,woodenboater,2013-10-11 15:00:00,2277,shop had ms170 stihl for a nice price
812291,aplumma,2013-10-11 18:15:00,6896,"Yaa did fine keeping the same size bar on it will make chain purchases easier. We run 20"" bars and have 12 chains at various ages it makes it easy to run thru 11 chains and then sit down and sharpen them at once on a CS sharpener. Good choice and use quality oil in the saw and special Chainbar oil to keep them happy for a long time.   Art"

However, for $400, and the light duty you plan an doing, I'd get a cheaper Echo and use the extra $$ to buy accessories.

810141,wormdunker,2013-09-30 23:23:00,1711,"Go with aplumma's advice.  Parts availability is important.  I have a husquvarna - great saw.  It's a model 353 - 5 years old - no issues.  It's only a 16"" bar but I don't plan to cut huge trees - getting too old to haul 100 lb pieces.  I like it also because it's lightweight easy to handle.  Cuts very fast due to high RPMs - can't remember the RPMs.  I owned a Craftsman 20"" bar for 25 years - too heavy.  Do your self a favour at the time of purchase.  Make sure you buy the safety equipment as well, such as the loggers chaps, hard hat with face screen & ear muffs, loggers gloves,  & the jacket to protect yourself."
810142,woodenboater,2013-09-30 23:51:00,2277,"Thanks all.  I have 11 acres so will need to maintain that as well lest it goes crazy and becomes too much work. Actually leaning towards Echo and Jonsereds for the work I'll be doing. Don't need pro saws and have heard good for both of these two. Much will depend on the local dealer/service network in the GTA.  Have the bucket and mask, just need the chaps and gloves. Undecided about regular steel toes (which I have) or boots with instep protection as well. Will also probably take a safety course this fall or next spring.  Chris, never heard about Poulan buying Husky. All I hear is that the plain Jane Poulan's aren't a good buy but the Pro's are very underrated and good value."
810143,Rod Caster,2013-09-30 23:56:00,5784,I heard the same thing chris...I was told only to buy the Husky's make in Sweden.
810145,Bernie,2013-10-01 00:02:00,3190,"About 3 years ago I bought a medium small Poulan from one of our suppliers. It runs OK, but it's not a very good saw. Small fuel tank, isolation springs bent, fuel cap hard to turn plus a few other nags.We have a small Echo that has been around for years that is twice the saw. Been problem free, small and lightweight, starts easy.No problem recommending an Echo product of any kind."

If a Sthil was the same price I'd probably gotten that, but for the price and the amount I use it which is enough times a summer clearing downed trees on trails and collecting fire wood it's been great. It's got the easy chain tensioner thingie and hasn't cause an issue. I don't know however whats better the easy tension or the bolt and tool tension. Bottom line it's been great for me and would recomende it if your on a budget. My 2 cents."

810198,blue pickeral,2013-10-01 09:49:00,267,The Stihls are good saws - however particularly loath the sliding plastic switch between choke-run-off. I can't count how many times a work gloved thumb has inadvertantly slipped on the grip and shut the saw down mid cut. Poor design. The couple I have have also had problems with rubber fuel lines rotting and splitting.

I got a new Poulan 3 years ago for some light duty stuff. Happy with it so far but I gotta stress that I have only ran 3 tanks of gas through it...so it doesn't get much use and tackles nothing tough.
