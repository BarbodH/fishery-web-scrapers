812339,RangerGuy,2013-10-12 01:16:00,564,"So while I was stuck on a development problem. I needed something to take my mind off of it for awhile the other day.  So extracted the gps track records from my last trip to LakAir.  It recorded 37 miles. I figure I burned 27 Litres.  So I was running my 18' Alaskan with 75hp yamaha spinning a customized 17p 3 blade aluminum.  Carrying a 19 US Gallons of fuel (full tank), roughly 25 lbs of decoys , 2 - 65 lb dogs, avery duckblind, 3 batteries, fishing gear and myself.  Here is the break down "
812343,buick14,2013-10-12 01:56:00,741,"Taking everything into consideration I'd say that sounds about right...I wouldn't complain with those #'s for a 75 on a packed 18' at all, especially if 2stroke......Mind you I don't have experience with 4 stroke, which I assume that's what you have...but it sounds about right to me"
812344,krixxer,2013-10-12 01:58:00,274,"I did a 42 mile run one day at near WOT; started sputtering at the dock  16 foother, 25 L tank loaded with 2 guys , fishing gear and 3 batteries I run a  30 year old 50hp 2stroke"
812349,irishfield,2013-10-12 02:14:00,26272,"Mileage.. on a boat... hmmm..     All I know for SURE.. I use less than half the fuel per season with my 275 Verado and 9.9 kicker, on the 22' Baron, than I did with my 115 Johnson 2 stroke on a 17' Glastron and that's using the Lund at least 40% more!"
812363,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-12 03:21:00,10439,I ran about 25 miles at 7/8 to full throttle with my 18' Fisher with 115 Merc 4 stroke and burned about 18 liters of fuel last Sunday. It gets much better if I can cut my RPMs back to 4K or under (I eas running 5-6K) I should get good mileage tomorrow as it's gonna be chilly in the AM. Supposed to drop to -5C by then. Doug out the rabbit fur bomber hat and snowmobile suit for the morning run.
812376,RangerGuy,2013-10-12 11:04:00,564,"Thanks guys,  Me watching fuel is about the fuel its about the condition of the motor, mileage is a good indicator of something's not right :-)  I have nothing to compare it to, since I would fill my old ranger 680 12 gallons and bring 2 25L gas cans for a long weekend and come home empty  I'm certainly way ahead :-)"
812377,lew,2013-10-12 11:13:00,12766,You'll be very pleased with that Yamaha for as long as you own it Greg.  It's  a fantastic motor.
812402,BillM,2013-10-12 14:14:00,17367,I find our F115 Yamaha just sips when the water is really really cold.  Tends to eat up more fuel the warmer the water gets.
812428,RangerGuy,2013-10-12 17:05:00,564,I'm very happy with it Lew or absolutely right!  just it seems my mileage has dropped since last year but I raised the motor again and balanced and cupped the prop so that could be it :-)
812437,Sinker,2013-10-12 18:03:00,8692,"I don't know anyone who pays as much attention to fuel mileage, and little details on a boat as you. I couldn't tell ya what my boats mileage is like, but I know when I'm out in it, its worth EVERY penny  S."
