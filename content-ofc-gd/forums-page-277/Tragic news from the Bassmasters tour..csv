Johnson was in Jackson to compete at the Bassmaster Central Open on Ross Barnett Reservoir scheduled to begin Oct. 17.  Johnson was staying with his wife at a Motel 6 on Frontage Road near Interstate 55. Jackson Police Department spokesperson Colendula Green said the department received the call of the shooting at 7:48 p.m. Sunday.  Jackson police are looking for a black male suspect that appeared on security camera footage.  Chris Bowes, senior tournament manager for the Bassmaster Opens, said in a release that a friend of Johnson discovered someone burglarizing his boat. The shooting took place shortly thereafter. His wife was not injured.  When contacted Monday afternoon, Green said the investigation was still on-going.  ""There was some sort of violent altercation near his hotel room door,"" Bowes told The Clarion-Ledger  Johnson, of Ganado, Texas, was 11th in Central Open standings after two events. The top five anglers from each of three open divisions qualify for the elite series. Johnson was in the top five percent of the nearly 200 fisherman who have competed in the central division this year, according to Bowes.  Johnson entered the final open event of the season with a chance to qualify for the highest division in 2014.  â€œJimmy was a terrific angler, as he has shown through the Bassmast........"
