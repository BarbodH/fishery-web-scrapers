812315,Sinker,2013-10-11 20:40:00,8692,"Rubbing two sticks works, but its not easy. I've done it for fun, but in a survival situation, I wish you good luck. Its not easy. I'll take my bic lighter every time. S."
812342,Nipfisher,2013-10-12 01:35:00,2449,spinning a stick with a bow to create smouldering works. You just need a rock or wood to hold the top of the stick.
812405,blaque,2013-10-12 14:34:00,2419,"I also was just experimenting for fun at the time. I gave the bow and arrow technique a pretty good effort and failed. I was using woods from the shop, pines and poplars.......obviously was doin something wrong lol"
812482,Gallie,2013-10-12 22:12:00,1215,"Always have a lighter since i smoke, rarely do i not have a flashlight that i can destroy to make a fire plus the battery in the boat which i can always get a spark off of. Usually have lighters hidden in other places too in case one dies."
812502,Sinker,2013-10-13 00:27:00,8692,"It absolutely works, its just not easy. You need the right materials for sure, or its not going to happen. A bic lighter works much better.  S."
812851,jedimaster,2013-10-14 20:37:00,3472,I have used wood to start a fire several times. Altough this was under ideal circumstances doing it just for fun. Could I do it in an emergency? Yes. Would I want to? No. What do I carry? A pack of waterproof strike anywhere matches and a knife. No need to carry tinder in north america. There is tinder everywhere. Especially in Ontario. Cedar and birch trees are everywhere. When I hunt I have a piece of firesteel with me and I can light a fire no problem with that either in rain or snow.
812894,Ainsley,2013-10-15 02:05:00,142,I use cotton balls soaked in Vaseline and light it with a Ferro rod. I made starters with a Ferro rod attached to an aluminum pill capsule. I can fit about four cotton balls in there. They're super compact and keep one on an emergency key chain along with a whistle and compass. In my full blown kit I carry a film container with the balls and a few sticks of fat wood. I also carry a Ferro rod on my knife sheath.
812142,npt1,2013-10-11 01:01:00,220,"Hello Everyone,  I always have a fire starter kit with me when I am fishing or portaging into a back lake. It consists of wooden matches with waxed over heads, magnifying glass, corks soaked in rubbing alcohol and sealed in plastic zip lock bag, and if all else fail due to wet conditions, a can of sterno. Its light weight and easy to carry.  What do you use?"
812146,Rod Caster,2013-10-11 01:10:00,5784,I bought a magnesium block for spark and I have some dried chaga mushroom as tinder. That stuff holds a spark very well.
812147,Sinker,2013-10-11 01:13:00,8692,Bic lighter. Always. Everywhere I go.  S.
812148,Fisherman,2013-10-11 01:14:00,7201,"0000 oiled  Steel wool in a zip lock bag,  lights with a match and burns hot and fast.  Dryer lint,  it's loaded with wax from the dryer sheets."
812149,Old Ironmaker,2013-10-11 01:14:00,8243,"A Zippo kept in a good Ziploc bag. Or no bag. Never had a problem. Worked outdoors on the docks, in the rain, waves pounding on the wharf, and us. You can't radio the First Mate on the ore laker and tell him we'll dock your boat when the wind and rain die down.  What's the magnifying glass for? If it's to use the Sun to burn , if everything is wet it's probably raining and overcast. A lighter works great."
812154,bigugli,2013-10-11 01:19:00,6138,Waterproof matches and striker along with a wax cone starter
812158,big guy,2013-10-11 01:40:00,414,"I always have a roll of toilet paper in the boat, inside an ice cream container and a lighter. The paper can serve two purposes. If I am going some place that doesn't have cottages along the shoreline, I also carry Ronson's lighter fluid and a blue tarp for an emergency shelter."
812168,irishfield,2013-10-11 02:44:00,26272,"I usually have about 40 gallons of Avgas with me!!... but always have a lighter in my pocket and a ziplock bag of dryer lint in my flying vest, just in case I swim to shore one day."
812179,woodenboater,2013-10-11 03:53:00,2277,char cloth and a sparker in an altoids type tin or ziplock.
812194,RangerGuy,2013-10-11 11:38:00,564,I carry a lighter and flint rock...
812204,outllaw,2013-10-11 13:07:00,1232,a lighter and the fuzz in my belly button. endless supply
812215,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-11 13:58:00,0,i make pucks out of dryer lint and vaseline.
812216,Freshtrax,2013-10-11 14:12:00,2215,"Cotton balls in a pill bottle soaked in Vaseline ,  always in the snowmobile and the canoe ."
812220,blaque,2013-10-11 14:24:00,2419,"I feel like im watching an episode of survivorman..........A Bic lighter has never failed me.  Ill add the question.......Has anyone ever successfully created fire ""rubbing two sticks together"". Theres many techniques, and ive tried a couple with ZERO success lol"
812230,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-11 15:10:00,10439,Zippo lighter here too. Only lighter you can drop in the lake and light the second you pull it out. I also carry a magnesium fire starter.
812231,woodenboater,2013-10-11 15:14:00,2277,"I found the only problem with lighters is that if you're freezing cold and near hypothermic, getting your fingers to grasp and trip the lighter is pretty tough. magnesium sticks and dry tinder also work well. ymmv"
812234,Old Ironmaker,2013-10-11 15:22:00,8243,"I like the dryer lint trick. I'm going to try it on the fire asap. Steel Wool has manganese in it, burns very hot but for a very short time. Like I said as many others have mentioned a lighter works great.  I always shake my head when I watch Les Stroud, why didn't you bring a lighter!!!!!!!! My wife always reminds me it's a TV show. That goes for all the other survivalist shows out there. I love the one with the former US special forces guy with the pretty British blond wife. She's always screaming about some bug or snake she has to kill and eat."

I like them all.......Survivorman, Dual Survival (with the old partner Dave, dont like the new guy), Man/Woman/Wild is the one with the hysterical british lady lol. I cant blame her, the guy made her drink his urine once. Not big on bear grylls but ill watch him in a pinch."

If you like a good survival show, check out naked and afraid on discovery channel its crazy. No clothes, minimal filming crew( maybe 1 or 2 people), they each get one item to bring, and its 28 days of survival in places like Africa, Borneo, Amazon etc"

Maybe next is a survival show with more than 1 ex wife for 28 days. How about a show where everyone is a multiple amputee. Please no cards or letters. It's a joke."
812248,FishTracker,2013-10-11 16:03:00,47,"I'll always bring a lighter, which is the primary method for speed and efficiency.  I also bring a flint striker to throw a spark as well.  You don't have to worry about fuel or about it getting wet.  To go along with those two methods, I also bring a small sealed container with a few cotton balls.  Just need a small amount (< 1/10th of one) and the spark from the flint or flame from the lighter catches quickly.  Some people prefer to soak the cotton in vaseline first, which keeps the flame a bit longer.  Sock lint works well too!  Just be sure to have lots of dry tinder to keep it going!"
812290,SirCranksalot,2013-10-11 18:13:00,3291,Birch bark will light readily even when wet.
812295,JoshS,2013-10-11 18:49:00,729,"Bic lighter. Always. Everywhere I go.  S. I agree, Bic's are the best. They can be submerged and still work. They always work! I always have a few bics around."
