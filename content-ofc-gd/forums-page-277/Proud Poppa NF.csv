812030,DanD,2013-10-10 16:42:00,2223,Well I just can't help myself and had to post this; my little girl has accomplished her dream of becoming a lawyer. The best part is the firm she's working for is right here in London. She stops in at home 2 or 3 times a week and she's not asking for money anymore. LOL Way to go Michelle!!!!!!!!!   Dan 
812031,kickingfrog,2013-10-10 16:50:00,8333,I can't imagine what that feels like. I well up with emotion when my son prints his name and none of the letters are backwards.
812032,Roy,2013-10-10 16:54:00,13728,Congrats to Michelle and to you and the family for supporting her. It's now your turn to pass by her place for a few bucks from time to time.  Thanks for the good news.
