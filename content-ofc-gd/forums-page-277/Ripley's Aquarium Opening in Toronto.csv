812669,irishfield,2013-10-13 21:20:00,26272,The Shedd Aquarium in Chicago is $28.95 US for admittance and worth EVERY dime... can only hope that this is in the same level of interest and puts Toronto on the map in a similar fashion. I first went to the Shedd in 1988 and have been back 4 times since to spend money in Chicago. Hopefully many do the same in Toronto.

812784,SirWhite,2013-10-14 14:43:00,210,I went in two weeks ago. There are a lot of Sharks and hall walk way underwater viewing. Looks pretty classy though. Also has two shark images on tile on roof it's gonna look good for aerial shots during Leaf Games and Blue Jays games.
