Kind of irked me.  Maybe just embarrassed?"
812715,Joey,2013-10-14 02:11:00,9122,"We spent another week up on Nipissing this past week and enjoyed the beautiful fall colors and amazing weather most of the week.  The trees had turned and lost more leaves than I had expected, but there was still plenty of color to enjoy.  We arrived Saturday afternoon and it was dreary out.  We fished for pickerel in the afternoon staying pretty local to our cabin at Lakair, but didn't get a sniff.  It was rainy and dull out, but I took a few photos.  This loon was very cooperative, but the camera did not like the dull conditions.        This shot turned out kind of neat in the weather conditions.  Ignore the out of focus birds head in the forefront     Took Ralphie for a nice walk and enjoyed the scenery.        Sunday was windy and dreary again, lots of rain on and off so we stuck close by again and did a bit of worm drowning and casting for pike.  I ended up with 2 perch and a pike and Paul got 2 pike.  Only took a shots that day.  Again, crappy photography weather.                Monday was a write off.  It was very, very windy and we tried trolling with the kicker for either pike or pickerel but we ended up having to troll too fast or we'd get blown too close to the shore/rocks.  Once the wind gusts hit 50, we called it a day and went back and watched movies at the cabin.  My only shot of the day was this poor gull on the dock with a wounded leg.    Tuesday was very cold in the morning, but the fog made for a lovely morning.        Target for the morning was musky, and I got a beauty, actually, my PB.  I casted out and saw the swirl and the side of a large fish take a swipe and miss my lure.  I reeled a bit and saw the lure just covered in weeds so yelled for Paul to cast out there.  I reeled in as fast as I could, cleared the weeds off and casted out again, nothing     Casted out once more and BAM, fish on.  And what a strong fish.  Went on two good runs and did a nice jump out of the water, then Paul netted it like a pro.  It came in at 48"" and was a nice heavy beast.  I tried to get a picture standing but I decided sitting down with it would be much easier with it's weight.  Paul took a few pics and it wriggled a bit and I lost my gill grip and could feel some teeth and gill plate on my fingers, but did not let go.  Paul measured it and I carefully put it back in the net to revive.  I then realized it had crapped all over my shirt, pants and the boat floor.  So I was cleaning that mess up and noticed there was now blood mixed in with it all and realized my hand was bleeding pretty good.  I ended up getting it everywhere, on the camera when I was putting it away, the dog while I tried to keep him out of the crap, what a mess  So Paul did the tail release and it swam away good and strong.  What a beauty and I was thrilled!!!              I think it managed to get every finger on the hand, either front or back!!           We went for pickerel later that night and I got a nice keeper       Ralphie looks terrified of it     Too bad the shot was out of focus!!!     All in all we ended up that I got the musky, a pike, the pickerel, a perch and a bluegill and Paul got a pike and a perch.  That night we got back to camp and there was a scheduled power outtage.  It was actually kind of fun eating by battery light.  Since there was no power to the area, the stars were amazing and we sat outside and stargazed and even saw a shooting star.  Got some nice sunset pics that night too             Continued......."
812716,Joey,2013-10-14 02:11:00,9122,"Wednesday was a beautiful day.  Warm and sunny.  Shorts and t-shirt weather.  Unfortunately, it changed the fishing and they turned off.  We were skunked for the day.  I did get a nice musky follow first thing in the morning.  I'd estimate a 46""er, but it seems it was not hungry.  Just kind of hung there, didn't follow the figure 8, just submarined down after awhile.  I got bored and tried to get a pic of Paul's lure hitting the water.  Not an easy task actually, but this was the best I could do.     Thursday was another beauty day.  We managed some pike that day.  2 for me and 3 for Paul.  I also had two more musky follows, but they were still not taking the bait.             So here's a story.  The CO's came over for a visit.  Nice fellas.  Checked our licences etc. and asked if we had safety equipment, alcohol on the boat etc.  All was well.  I took a pic of them leaving after they checked another boat down the bay, nice craft.       They took off like a bat out of hell and them BAM, hit a rock!!   Oooopsie.  I took a shot right after when the engine up and them scratching their heads     We saw them later and I asked if they did any damage.  The one guy says ""what do you mean?"" with a sheepish grin.  I said ""when you hit that rock"" and he says ""what rock?"" and then ""Oh you heard that eh, ah just a little scratch on the skeg.""  Hmmmmmmmmm   Went out for pickerel that night and only got a rock bass each.  Friday morning was the foggiest morning up there.  First time I have not been able to see the island looking toward Warren's Bay, and it was a long, slow ride out to Muskrat.              The fog was in patches and got really bad as we passed Memquisit, then as we came into the bay, it cleared all up, but we could see it in the distance.  It slowly rolled over us.  Was pretty cool, and eerie at the same time.         It made a halo effect in front of you, like a rainbow kind of.        Paul managed to be the pike master that day, catching 4 and one at a nice 30""     The sunset was absolutely gorgeous that evening              Paul took a picture of me taking a picture of the sunset.  Turned out kinda cool.     Saturday was sunny but with an east wind.  We only fished half the morning as TJ and Monique invited us to their annual turkey hang.  Paul managed 1 pike and I was el skunkarood.  I really didn't care at that point as my back was so sore from casting lures all week it was hard to do it anymore.  We had an absolute blast at the turkey hang and ate like kings.  Thanks so much TJ and Monique for a great time and fine food and company.                             We headed back this morning and stopped at my sisters in Bradford for Thanksgiving dinner.  So two turkey dinners in two nights.  Very lucky indeed!!!  Here are some other shots I took in no particular order.  Sandhill cranes flying over TJ's backyard     Cormorants on the rock     Ralphie falling asleep in the boat sitting up     A Bonaparts Gull        Feathers floating on the bay       Our home for the week.      Garter snake                      Brown water snake, that actually bit me when I picked it up.  I'm usually pretty good at it.  Guess I've lost my touch.                             Rusty Blackbird        Thanks Leslie for all your hospitality and a wonderful stay once again.  Sorry we missed Kevin this time.  We'll be back in June as usual.  Hope you all enjoyed.  Joey "
