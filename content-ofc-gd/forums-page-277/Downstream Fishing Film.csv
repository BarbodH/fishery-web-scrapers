812012,fish_finder,2013-10-10 13:56:00,370,"A while back I posted a trailer to a fly fishing film that a few of us put together.  The film was accepted into the International Fly Fishing Film Festival a couple of years ago.  While it was in the festival, we had to keep the full length film under wraps.  Now however, we've released the film for free public viewing.  I chatted with Mister Spiel, rod building master, and he seemed to think it would be a great idea to post the full film here for folks to view.  So here it is!  The entire film was shot in southwestern Ontario, primarily in the Grey/Bruce region.  Downstream Vol. 1  ~ Testing Trout   Info on the who's and what's in the film can be found here:  http://www.flyfishontario.ca/fly-fishing-videos/other-fly-fishing-videos/downstream-vol-1-testing-trout.html  We have another film in the works as well.  Downstream Vol. 2 ~ Chrome Highlights.  We are still looking for a few key actors in the depths of our great lakes tributaries for this one  We'd love to hear your feedback on the first film!"

812055,Christopheraaron,2013-10-10 18:44:00,3525,"Nice job! What I'd like to see in the next one is a little more commentary, some sort of a story maybe, if you look at the best IF4 films they all have that. Keep it up!"

812081,RDR,2013-10-10 20:56:00,125,Great video! Nice to see the hardcore guys at work on some really nice water
812213,fish_finder,2013-10-11 13:52:00,370,"Thanks folks!  Nice job! What I'd like to see in the next one is a little more commentary, some sort of a story maybe, if you look at the best IF4 films they all have that. Keep it up!  You'll probably be interested in the rod building film that's in the works.  It follows a local rod builder searching for antler sheds for reel seats and feathers for inlays straight through to fishing the rod and describing the passion of fly fishing from end to end.  Great video! Nice to see the hardcore guys at work on some really nice water  Nice water indeed!  We're lucky to have access to some stretches of water that see no pressure whatsoever."
812266,Musky or Specks,2013-10-11 16:39:00,2710,I know Ken's big net is a Fournier but are all the nets used in the film Fournier's. Chris would be interested to know.
812284,fish_finder,2013-10-11 17:43:00,370,Just Kens net.  Is Chris still making them?  Several of us would be interested if so.  I've seen quite a few fish end up in that particular net
812314,Musky or Specks,2013-10-11 20:37:00,2710,Are you looking for the canoe model like Ken's or the smaller nets I think they might still be available at the gallery in Elora but I'll ask.  Also http://www.cflandingnets.com/
812327,fish_finder,2013-10-11 22:46:00,370,"Cool.  I live right outside Elora, so I'll check it out.  For some reason I thought he was done making them."
