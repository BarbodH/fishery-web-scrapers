It seems I have to pick up a piece of metal every month when I drive into Hamilton. Same thing last night. Best part.. the new hole is beside an existing plug and they don't have the tire available til after the holiday. It's been 4 years since I last got a tire to last more than 50k"
812621,crappieperchhunter,2013-10-13 16:33:00,2582,You are not having any luck that's for sure. I had a nail this summer that I heard clipping on the pavement when I was driving slow in town  with the windows down. It was short enough that it never punctured all the way through. In 34 years of driving that is my only metal ever in my tires.
812624,lew,2013-10-13 16:46:00,12766,My last flat was in 2005 and the day after I took delivery of a brand new truck. The tire had about 20 miles on it and was ruined by a large drywall screw that went through the sidewall.
812627,ChasinTails,2013-10-13 16:59:00,90,"last time that happend to me was when i hit  glass bottle on the highway, it took me down to florida a couple times it had about 80k miles on it"
812629,lew,2013-10-13 17:08:00,12766,"last time that happend to me was when i hit  glass bottle on the highway, it took me down to florida a couple times it had about 80k miles on it  In your intro a couple days ago you said you were 14, so were you riding your bike on the hiway ??"
812631,Terry,2013-10-13 17:11:00,14456," In your intro a couple days ago you said you were 14, so were you riding your bike on the hiway ?? x2"
812632,i2cool2fool,2013-10-13 17:12:00,349,I just replaced the rubber on my RAM. I am knocking on wood 1) no metal issues 2) I get 95k on these like I did with ones I just replaced
812634,leaf4,2013-10-13 17:23:00,2466,hahahaha
812637,ChasinTails,2013-10-13 17:39:00,90," In your intro a couple days ago you said you were 14, so were you riding your bike on the hiway ?? my dads car"
812655,outllaw,2013-10-13 19:41:00,1232,tires I did them for chrylsers on the truck fleet. I have seen some grisly puntures. best though was a live 303 round casing and all. as personal issues I always get sidewall bit. new tire then.
812674,Richie Razor,2013-10-13 21:42:00,536,You gotta be pretty darn unlucky to constantly get your tire damaged when driving into Hamilton. If I were you I'd bus it in and avoid the hassle and save some tire repair later.
812679,leaf4,2013-10-13 22:22:00,2466,lol where are you driving that you are getting nails in so often scrap yards?  haha no one I know ever has this problem
812683,irishfield,2013-10-13 22:33:00,26272,"Right side tires Bruce??? if so, stop hugging the curb!"
812691,Bernie,2013-10-13 23:08:00,3190,Years ago I once removed a customers tire to repair it.I found 5 nails in the tire. I think that we sold him a new one.
812692,glen,2013-10-13 23:13:00,2641,We're they the same type of nail?
812693,Bernie,2013-10-13 23:14:00,3190,Nope. All different and some appeared like they were in it for a while.
812695,bigugli,2013-10-13 23:34:00,6138,Burlington st. and the Redhill have a lot of scrap haulers running the roads constantly. Sadly those are my main routes into the hospitals. Every tire has been patched at least once. I had the same problem when I worked in construction. Trades were always sloppy when reloading their pouches with nails and screws. That only stopped when I (the site super) started docking anyone we caught dropping metal on the road. We were paying out $400 in tire repairs to new home owners with nail punctures
