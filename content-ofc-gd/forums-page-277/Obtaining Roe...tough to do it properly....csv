812826,John Bacon,2013-10-14 18:21:00,3277,"look for a adipose fin clip or removal...then you have a stock fish....co incidentally are getting harder to find (from my experience )  While a clipped fish is most certainly a hatchery fish; an unclipped fish is not necessarily wild.  I am not sure about Lake Huron on Georgian Bay; but very few hatchery fish stocked in the Lake Ontario watershed are clipped.  I am with Metro East Anglers and we stock unclipped bows, browns, cohos, and Atlantics.  I don't think that Credit River Anglers clips their fish either.  There was a period of about five years for which all Chinooks stocked in Lake Ontario were clipped.  Prior to this Chinooks stocked at pen sites were clipped.  To the best of my knowledge there is currently no clipping of Chinook salmon stocked in Lake Ontario.  I am not sure if the MNR is currently doing any clipping on fish stocked in the Lake Ontario watershed.  Currently, any mature hatchery Chinooks in Lake Ontario will likely be clipped, so an unclipped mature Chinook from Lake Ontario is most likely wild.  However, this was not the case in the past, and will not be the case in the future.  Even now there may be some unclipped males, especially jacks, running the rivers.  Clipping has never been a reliable way to determine whether a bow, brown, Atlantic, or coho was a wild fish.  There have always been unclipped fish being stocked.  Many atlantics at too young of age (sometimes with their yolk sacks still attached) for clipping to be practical.  So no, you cannot always differentiate between wild and hatchery fish by looking for a fin clip."

Since the purpose of clipping the fish was to be able to identify stocked versus wild fish, there was no point in clipping only the Ontario stocked Chinooks.  Also, most of the clipping was done with the automated stocking trailer owned by New York state.  This trailer was no longer going to be available.  There was no point in Ontario manually clipping ~540,000 Chinook if the U.S. was going to be stocking in excess of a million unclipped Chinook each year.  So far, there has been no reduction in the number of Chinook stocked on the Canadian side of Lake Ontario.  The annual target remains at 540,000 fish per year.  Cohos have not been stocked by the MNR for many years.  The MEA stocks the cohos and they are not clipped.  I don't believe that MNR was clipping the cohos when were stocking them.  There were a few years were cohos were not stocked and it took a great deal of effort to find enough fish to provide eggs for the hatchery.  They are recovering now that stocking has been going on for a few years now.  They were definitely not doing well enough to sustain a fishery without stocking.  I have not seen any official results of any studies done on clipped versus unclipped Chinooks in Lake Ontario.  Based on anecdotal evidence, I would say it has been about 50/50 wild versus stocked."

Case in point, this lovely fish from 2010. I was convinced it was a natural fish - until I got home and looked at the pics on the computer (note the clipped pelvic fin!) The first fish is definitely a stocker, and you can compare with the second on which you can definitely see the huge pelvic fins are intact. The stocker far outperformed the other...  but even so, not all stocking programs clip their fish's fins - so they might both be stockers!

I for one agree that more education is needed for all river anglers. It's kind of like a shoot first ask questions later mentality most river anglers have.  There is definitely a demographic change in steel heading. A lot more young and uneducated (as it pertains to river dynamics) anglers out on the river.

If milking out I assume you're using unured eggs.  I rarely if ever use loose mature eggs. Almost always mature skeined eggs. They're softer and have way more scent. And yes they tend to milk out quickly and require more constant changing.  I use a very light cure as well. If you don't cure them at all they'll turn white almost instantly especially in cold water.  Color is critical at times as well.

For a heavy egg user, its expensive, and limits the option to whatever cure is thrown on the eggs by the seller, or the hatchery he is purchasing from.  I don't want to be limited to one cure.  I want natural uncured, pro-cured eggs, salt cured, boraxed and on and on.  They all serve a different purpose to me under different water conditions.  I also want some skein, some scraped skein, some loose etc.  I make absolutely no bones about harvesting a few salmon and a few trout every year.  What I don't do is then go on the internet and gripe about lack of conservation measures by fellow fishermen.  I know I'm going to kill some fish to keep fishing, and I won't sugar coat it for anyone.  I make sure I take my fish home, and that they get put to use.  All trout are consumed.  Late salmon might be composted if they are inedible.  Fresh ones with skein get smoked.  But in reality, those are the only migratory fish I keep all year, and all else are released, so I am probably killing way less fish than the average fellow going out for dinner fish.  I will never complain about the guys that want to harvest some trout for food though, as they are the ones that will keep us fishing when the pure catch and release advocates would put us in a position that fishing with no purpose other than enjoyment could be deemed cruel.  Further, I seldom release a legal pickeral, unless its into a pan of hot oil, so who the heck am I to judge.  Steelhead are put on a pedestal because they are pretty, and will give you a good fight, but make no mistake, they are a fish like all the others.  Heck at one time, I knew an old cat that kept every legal musky he caught.  Do I understand it, no not really but it was legal, and he ate them, so more power to him.  Anyway, my 2 cents!"
812737,Twocoda,2013-10-14 04:57:00,4130,"On a somewhat related note I fished the Geen yesterday and was appalled at the number of fish being roped. I'll bet 80% of the fish caught on that river are killed, catch and release is almost non existant. One older gent killed a beauty 10lb hen right next to me his only comment being ""hope this one has some good eggs"".  It's so early in the fall season there's no way the eggs in that fish will be anywhere mature enough. Total waste.  Education is sorely lacking among many of our fellow anglers.   most of the people that come to the geen havent a clue as to what they are doing so alot go home empty handed ...but when it is hot fishing and a novice fisherman does manage to catch a fish...9 times out of ten they are eating that fish just because the caught one ....what really ticks me off is when the semi novice fishermen think they are doing good by releasing the fish after having their fingers up in the gill plates... when i see it i usually sit and shoot the crap with them for a bit ... politely get them at ease and then educate them explaining mortality rates to fish that have been handled in that manner....with the comparison as what it like for a human to run a distance with a hole in their lungs...yes they can run away out of eye shot (which looks like they are swimming away ) ....but they bleed out and die, When i leave them to fish ...not only have i made a new acquaintance to say hello to when i see them again but i also ask them if they could pay the new education forward to someone else. i wont get into all the other issues i see on a daily basis,Every little bit helps when it comes to education of handling with good intentions of releasing...Mike i know you know your stuff as do the guys you fish with ...im just throwing this out there for the people that read the forum because as i said...every little bit helps  Cheers"

812382,solopaddler,2013-10-12 12:27:00,8605,"On a somewhat related note I fished the Geen yesterday and was appalled at the number of fish being roped. I'll bet 80% of the fish caught on that river are killed, catch and release is almost non existant. One older gent killed a beauty 10lb hen right next to me his only comment being ""hope this one has some good eggs"".  It's so early in the fall season there's no way the eggs in that fish will be anywhere mature enough. Total waste.  Education is sorely lacking among many of our fellow anglers.  I have nothing against keeping fish, but not indiscriminately. All the great work being done on that river by the Ontario Steelheaders and others is constantly being undermined and it's sad to see."

I do agree,but will never happen.   Im all for C&R,BUT IT IS THEIR RIGHT  MIKE.,but I hear what yer saying. This time of year is for meat,not eggs,  Good work by the local clubs there. When I seen it for myself last fall,it was amazing. Guess I,ll just keep fishing the C&R part of my riv,knowing I,m doing my part.  Then again,I did have a request for a small fish,and hit a C&K. part of the riv.  I didnt feel to bad about it,as it was a clone 3 pounder."

811558,Familyfisherman,2013-10-08 00:05:00,188,"So I went fishing with a few friends on Bronte last week.  What an eye opener...  Everyone I saw was basically trying to snag the salmon in the mouth...as if this was a completely acceptable practice?  Clearly it was what anyone who ""caught"" fish was doing, because I drifted singled eggs, yarn, Jensen eggs, etc past fish all day without even a sniff except from a small male brown late morning.  I walked quite a ways and watched 3 separate people snag fish, land them, on 2 instances cut them and take the roe and then just chuck the fish...which was obviously not an isolated thing as there were dead fish with cut open bellies every 30 feet on the creek.  The place reeked.  So, my question is, how do people actually get roe?  From my brief experience you can't actually catch a fish with loose roe, as they showed absolutely no interest in anything I had with me...I'm also thinking any fish at the mouth earlier on who actually might bite wouldn't have loose roe?  I have to say that was one of the worst ""fishing"" experiences I've ever had...I won't be back for late season salmon.  I realize they die anyway, but flossing fish trying to spawn just has no sport in it in my opinion...  Glad for some feedback.  "
811561,Burtess,2013-10-08 00:24:00,901,"I am going to be honest here.....  I use roe amoungst many other baits for steelhead, the last salmon I harvested for roe came was a pier fish with a looser skein taken 4 years ago.  I ran out this spring.  So I am not a very heavy roe user.  I needed to replenish the stock for the next couple years or so...... so I went out this past weekend and spent an hour catching a female salmon, perfectly just to the side of the nose inside the mouth, on a single Jensen egg in cherise.   Landed her, bonked her on the head, triple garbage bagged, and into the backpack.  I am not very keen on slitting them up on the river bank, best to do that stuff at home.  So a perfectly legal fish but did it actually hit the bait, I highly doubt it.  How did the hook get in the mouth?  Angler skill?  Lol whatever....  I am just glad I don't have to fish that flow again until November when the trout start coming in.  Definitely no sport in that!!  Burt"
811564,BillM,2013-10-08 00:27:00,17367,If I need roe I either go to the states and get some from the mutant stockers that don't reproduce or get them trolling out in Lake O while they are staging before the run starts and will still readily smash a SD/fly combo.
811566,Salmonidstalker,2013-10-08 00:31:00,265,"Have you thought about buying roe?  There are a few web-based companies that offer it at a decent price.  As for loose roe, legally, you must keep the entire fish and not let the carcass spoil.  Harvest your eggs at home.  What you witnessed at the river was illegal....but nothing new to salmon fishing.   Its too bad you had a terrible experience, the river can be an amazing escape from the every day urban environment, even in the GTA.  When it gets cold, head back down.  There will be a lot less of what you saw and a lot more silver fish around."
811568,MJL,2013-10-08 00:35:00,2427,"You’re probably a little late now but hit the fish cleaning stations where the charter boats come in. 99.9% of the time you get skein in the cans but it saves you the time and hassle of catching a fish yourself just for eggs.  In my case, this year my neighbour asked me for a fish to try on his new BBQ. Middle of last month I caught a smaller chrome hen off the pier on a crankbait (smallest fish of the night – I didn’t want to carry the bigger ones back to the car).  I brought it home, kept the eggs and gave him the meat…Have to thank Young_One for the fillet job he did for me that night  "

No you don't, you can legally strip a fish and release it..  That roe counts as 1 fish towards your limit, unless they've changed the regs recently.  However, you're correct about discarding the rest of the fish if it is in face dead (ie leaving it on the bank)"
