812126,Rustic-Fisher,2013-10-10 23:59:00,826,"FREE........ (though the dog that points and retrieves them them may require a treat) Every year I have loads of pheasant , grouse and woodcock feathers along with rabbit fur that just gets tossed when field dressing the animals . Theres lots to go around. If someone can use the feathers or fur let me know and its yours. Hate wasting any part of an animal. Cheers. Ryan  "
