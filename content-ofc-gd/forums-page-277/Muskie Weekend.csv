812546,Jen,2013-10-13 04:12:00,833,"I got away for a couple of days of Muskie fishing with my dad, son and uncle.  The weather did not really co-operate as you can see from the picture, however no one seemed to mind.  Nice to have a cover on the boat for days when the rain just won't let  up.  After a couple of hours of trolling and a few small pike on the first day, my Uncle caught our first and only muskie of the trip.  Christian did a great job on net and release.  The next morning after a great breakfast prepared and served by dad we headed out.  We spent a good part of the day changing lures and then all of a sudden on a perch coloured storm I caught my PB pike.  Christian did an excellent job netting, holding it up, and releasing it for me. A wonderful group effort by all.  The two days we spent away together was wonderful.  A time none of us will quickly forget.  There is nothing like wanting to catch fish, catching the ones you want, and doing that with the people you love."
