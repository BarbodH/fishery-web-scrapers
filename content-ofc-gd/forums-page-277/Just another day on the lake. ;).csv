T'was a tad on the brisk side but you gotta earn your biguns.\    All of the small pot hole lakes and ponds were already frozen over so tomorrow may be my last open water trip of the season, time will tell.  Ended up boating a bunch of small pike in the 5-7# range and a couple of 6-8# lakers.      Luckily it warmed up to a balmy +4 degrees so I could ditch my parka and snowmobile pants.    Now onto the best fish of the day. This big girl came out of 6 FOW on a large black dot Wolverine spoon. When it hit, I thought I was hooked up on the rocks and until I had pulled the boat to the fish I still thought I was on bottom. Once I got on top of the fish we had drifted over deeper water and I spied her about 8' down and new she was a goodun'. Didn't weigh or measure her but I figure mid 40"" and mid 20# range.        Back at it again in the morning."

812578,solopaddler,2013-10-13 12:42:00,8605," Great report Dave. You lead a charmed life.  Mike, it says that Wolverine spoons are available here:   Not the same spoon Roy, the one's Dave uses are only sold in Yellowknife.  He's been teasing me with them for years."
