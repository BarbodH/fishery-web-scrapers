809412,Twocoda,2013-09-25 15:21:00,4130,very enthusiastic report...i can relate with the adrenaline rush given the size and energy of the kings even at my age (it never gets old) ....its the best way to test out your equipment and a whole lot of fun to boot (pun intended)...we do an annual pilgrimage down to Lake O for floating upstream during the day and chucking hardware till all hours of the morning creating sleep deprivation and mishaps galore that become bonds shared with the pals...Our recent 4 day trip consisted of 12 hours sleep in total gallons of energy drinks and coffee and probably enough beef jerky to support a special delivery to our main supplier while we were in the area...good on ya guys !
809417,landry,2013-09-25 16:42:00,1005,"I was not aiming any slight towards the original poster. Looks like you had a great time! I once fished the salmon run enthusiastically. After a while, most steelheaders tire of river salmon fishing. I meant no offense. I don't know Bill and he is likely a great guy - I just thought his post was smug and all-knowing. Like I said he is likely a good man. I rarely river fish anymore after being a diehard for 20 years. I got sick of the competitiveness, bravado and territorial pissing. I enjoy being out in a boat far more these days. Have not really steelheaders much for the last 8 years or so."
809420,BillM,2013-09-25 17:14:00,17367," You need to not let the opinions of some random guy on a internet fishing forum bug you so much.   Really man, OP had a good time, I'm sure he doesn't give a rats ass at what I think about it, lol.    Hopefully he gets out on Lake O in July and experiences these fish at their prime, once he does he'll figure out why a lot of us don't bother with them once they are zombies and roaming the rivers."
809422,msp,2013-09-25 17:38:00,1336,"Now now Bill. Be nice Why is fishing for salmon any different than fishing for steelhead ? I mean come on, how hard is it to catch a fish that returns to the same river every year ? Not much of a challenge in my opinion. Good times anyway  Well done to the O.P. Nice report and pictures !"
809427,highdrifter,2013-09-25 18:13:00,2534, Mike are you saying you've given up on steelies?  Say it ain't so...
809429,msp,2013-09-25 18:30:00,1336,"Yes,  standing shoulder to shoulder on a riverbank and driving thousands of Km's for a bit of chrome does not really apeal to me anymore. BTW "" what you dont know can fill a bus """

809461,landry,2013-09-25 21:16:00,1005,Bill. I wasn't bothered by your post. Just felt bad for the guys as they were proud of their day/post. I like this board. We r approachable and welcoming unlike some other boards out there.

809343,BillM,2013-09-25 01:23:00,17367,Dirty boots in 2ft of water..  Did they even have a chance?
809351,Bassassins,2013-09-25 02:20:00,111, We are unclear of what you mean by this BIllM??   Captpierre - I am sooo glad you were wrong... lol  Thanks guys ... glad you liked it!
809353,solopaddler,2013-09-25 02:27:00,8605,Ironically you actually might get salmonella poisoning if you ate one of those things.  Glad to see you boys had fun.
809358,Bassassins,2013-09-25 02:50:00,111,CPR Mike ... Always practice CPR - its just safer

809362,landry,2013-09-25 03:43:00,1005,You are right on that comment but you were there once so way rain on their parade. That was rude and all mighty sounding.
809367,Bassassins,2013-09-25 04:49:00,111,What are we missing here boys???  
809368,Richie Razor,2013-09-25 05:04:00,536,"Some of the ""Holier than thou"" river fisher peeps frown on fishing small frogwater runs for zombie chinooks. I guess it isn't sporting enough for them unless you got the gear and the looks, and target a species that doesn't die after they do their thang....  Personally I don't care for it, but it looks like you guys had a blast !!! Great report and awesome pics. Don't let anyone rain on your parade.  DAS BOOT!!!!!!!"
809374,spincast,2013-09-25 09:34:00,3279,"Cool report. Doesn't matter where you catch 'em, they are the king of adrenaline. Some great photos."

809380,Christopheraaron,2013-09-25 12:00:00,3525,"Haha, just realized the first one is spitting eggs."
809383,Bassassins,2013-09-25 12:13:00,111," Thank you for explaining and thanks for what you said.  We have to say we don't know how ""zombie"" they all where when a few of these fish took 20 plus minutes to land and numerous fish had no problem breaking us off.  Assuming we stepped into a bigger ""issue"" here on this forum again... so much drama lol like sponsors and fishing location should we now modify our salmon report just for this forum that only has the little fish that eat the roe and run back down river?! **eye rolling**  Thanks everyone else for reading and enjoying."
809389,BassMan11,2013-09-25 12:51:00,583,You guys put together some great FISHING reports. Hopefully a few negative comments don't detour you from doing the same in the future. Keep it up!!
809390,Moosebunk,2013-09-25 13:04:00,3970,"Fished with both these fellas and will say that in person they are as much fun and enthusiastic about fishing as they come across on line.  As far as salmon fishing... if thousands of put-and-take fish with less chance for successful C&R can be taken for sport or money or fun by those able to do so on the lake, then a few lads enjoying some C&R with end of life river fish should certainly be nothing to smite.  Some salmonella poisoning can be infectiously fun."
809393,adolson,2013-09-25 13:31:00,783,"Lots of cool pics, and lots of nice fish!  I've only caught salmon once in my life, and luckily I am still healthy. I'm really careful now about where I stick my lure."

809396,Richie Razor,2013-09-25 13:54:00,536, Totally Agree

Kinda of like the living dead...."
809398,BillM,2013-09-25 13:56:00,17367, Can I get this engraved on my next rebuild?  I like the ring to it.   Or perhaps 'Zombie slayer?'
