812305,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-11 19:54:00,10439,There's a launch at the Queenston area.
812309,buick14,2013-10-11 20:18:00,741,That's where I launched last weekend for bass/pike etc....was hoping closer to the bar at the lake if possible....might not be possible though
812316,HTHM,2013-10-11 20:40:00,4082,That is the only Canadian launch open to the public in that area. All launches in NOTL are private.
812321,Luke V.,2013-10-11 21:12:00,286,HTHM is 100% correct Queenston is the only launch U have to be a member of the yaught Club in NOTL to launch there  It's not that far of a run I do it regularly in my 14 footer Takes me 15 mins max
