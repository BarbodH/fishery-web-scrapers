Took a few more shots of my land so I could PS my cabin and dock design onto the lot to get an idea of what the place would look like when finished.  A wide view of the site shot from the middle of the bay using my 250mm telephoto lens. This view shows the top dome of rock that you can't see from closer to the site.    Same view with dock and my preliminary cabin design Photoshopped into position.    Closeup view of the cabin.    This designing and planning is fun!!!"
812831,Jds63,2013-10-14 18:50:00,1365,"awesome, beautiful spot"
812832,davey buoy,2013-10-14 18:51:00,5505,That will be very nice for sure. You could almost move into that place lol. Wasn't thinking you were building something that nice and big .Can hardly wait till you start!!
812833,misfish,2013-10-14 19:08:00,29133,Windows face sunrise or sunset?    Like it matters. LOL   Nice.Dave.
812834,kickingfrog,2013-10-14 19:26:00,8333,Windows face sunrise or sunset?    Like it matters. LOL   Nice.Dave.  Neither... In the summer.
812835,Richie Razor,2013-10-14 19:28:00,536,Holy crap that's sweet!!! Is it a private lake whereas you are the only one on it? Road/boat/sled access? What's the cost to build something like that up there?
812836,lew,2013-10-14 19:30:00,12766,"That's gonna be fantastic Dave, but you need to Photoshop your boat to the dock to get the total picture"
812838,misfish,2013-10-14 19:40:00,29133, Neither... In the summer.     Not familiar with the area. I must be a dumb  .
812844,kickingfrog,2013-10-14 20:00:00,8333,"    Not familiar with the area. I must be a dumb  . Being near the Arctic Circle it would not have a sunset/sunrise in the summer or in the winter for that matter. Not exactly true, just meant to be a silly comment."
812865,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-14 23:34:00,10439," Holy crap that's sweet!!! Is it a private lake whereas you are the only one on it? Road/boat/sled access? What's the cost to build something like that up there?  There are other leases but they are minimum 300 meters apart. Boat in summer, ice road and sled in winter. Don't know until I build it. The good news is I have a friend that can get me windows and doors at cost. So that will cut costs. They are also working on a new multi-story building in town and they have been bringing me the syrofoam SM off cuts (3"" thick) to use in my floor insulation. I'm ordering my dock hardware from the South as well as my siding. Save a bunch of $$$ that way. May bring up my lumber too. Not sure yet.  Here's a map of Yellowknife and my lake. The red X is where my lease is. The lake is 14kms long and 3 1/2kms wide. It is over 300' deep at it's deepest spot.  "
812866,BillM,2013-10-14 23:42:00,17367,That's a long walk to the dock!
812868,Rich Clemens,2013-10-14 23:53:00,3131,I know where the next OFC GTG will be.  :-)
812869,i2cool2fool,2013-10-14 23:58:00,349,Wouldn't that be an awesome G2G and cabin warming party!
812870,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-14 23:59:00,10439,Windows face sunrise or sunset?    Like it matters. LOL   Nice.Dave.  North East so I can see the Northern lights during the dark months.
812875,Richie Razor,2013-10-15 00:34:00,536,"Also, you never addressed what types of fish the lake holds.... Pike and lakers I assume?"
812885,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-15 01:12:00,10439,"    And there are ciscoes, whitefish and ling.  "
812888,kickingfrog,2013-10-15 01:20:00,8333,Don't you hate it when a lake is loaded with nothin' but little ones.
