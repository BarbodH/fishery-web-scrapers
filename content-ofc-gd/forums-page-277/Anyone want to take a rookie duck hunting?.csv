811430,Sinker,2013-10-07 13:31:00,8692,"Gagnons just had some Tanglefree layout blinds on sale, worth a look.  Its a blind you lay down in for hiding in a field, in case you don't know.  Water spots are sacred, a field is a little different. If/when I get a field and need a guy, I'll get in touch.  S."

810337,TEP,2013-10-01 19:20:00,68,"My gun licence finally showed up in the mail. Bought a shotgun. A couple calls. Decoys.. Some camo. And a 14' boat I plan to paint up. I've done plenty of net research, but would appreciate any input from anyone who is in the know. I've also been to the range(trap) a couple times to test out the new toy. I'm told 14/25 is pretty good for a rookie. I live in Courtice if that matters. But willing to make a drive. Thanks!"
810339,chris.brock,2013-10-01 19:30:00,4053,"you have the gun licence (PAL), did you get your hunting, small game and migratory bird licences?"
810340,TEP,2013-10-01 19:32:00,68,Yessir! Turkey too.
810341,TEP,2013-10-01 19:33:00,68,My goal this season was to drop a couple ducks and god willing a turkey too. From what I hear neither is an easy task.
810342,TEP,2013-10-01 19:35:00,68,"But hey, I have devoted the last 15 years to muskies so I'm full of perseverance!!"

810369,TEP,2013-10-01 20:58:00,68,Well thanks Roy! I figure I have taken quite a few fellas off this site fishin over the years... Maybe I will have some good karma and get a volunteer!
810370,Rustic-Fisher,2013-10-01 20:59:00,826,"Fall means two things for me upland hunting and steelhead fishing . My self and short haired pointer pursue pheasants , grouse, rabbits , and ducks ( headed out in a minute actually) Your welcome to come a long on a hunt. It's tough getting started . PM me and we'll work something out. Cheers, Ryan"
810371,TEP,2013-10-01 20:59:00,68,Made some life long friends too. Just been crazy busy with kids and sports and that kinda stuff. Not alot of time for the net surfing...

810377,chris.brock,2013-10-01 21:16:00,4053,"Yessir! Turkey too.  nice, a 12 pack of beer and you're good to go (hahaha)"
810379,NAW,2013-10-01 21:24:00,4022,I'd love to take you out.  But I have been finding it really hard to get out these days.  Just to dam busy! How far are you willing to drive?
810506,mike rousseau,2013-10-02 13:57:00,4661,If you want easy duck hunting come down and try the st lawrence in December.... They're everywhere... And very limited hunters.... I'm in the Cornwall area and could share a couple spots with you if you like....   I should add... I don't hunt...I just know the river and where to hunt... My brother hints ducks...   ...

810515,ch312,2013-10-02 15:08:00,1590,Congrats on getting your PAL and hunting license it's always nice having more people join the hunting and shooting crew.
810541,TEP,2013-10-02 18:13:00,68,"I thank you all for the replies. I look forward to taking you all up on the offers! As far as the drive goes anything within 2 hours of the Oshawa area would work fine for me.  If I had a gun, ammo, camo clothes, decoys/weights, a couple calls, and a boat, what else would I need?"
810549,Spiel,2013-10-02 18:57:00,9065,"And for those of you who don't know ""TeamEmptyPockets"", He's as solid as they come.  I'll second that ten fold or my name isn't Spiel!"
810611,Sinker,2013-10-03 00:00:00,8692,"That's all you need man. The kawarthas are loaded with waterfowl. Spend some time scouting the lower ends of pigeon, sturgeon, chemong......any of the kawarthas really. Find a spot, set your decoys, and learn to shoot.  I know your a good guy, I've met you a couple times. I am a hardcore waterfowler. Its what I eat sleep and breath, but I've been burnt so many times by taking guys out that I've kind of stopped doing it. I went out for my first shoot yeaterday morning, and a guy I had taken out a couple years ago had bult a blind right in the spot I took him. I have a bit of a bad taste in my mouth right now, I hope you understand. Maybe if the guy didn't leave a half garbage bag full of garbage, and empty hulls laying there, I wouldn't feel this way, but that kind of crap really burns my butt!!  If you'd like some better info on hunting around here, PM me and I'd be glad to help you out, and maybe even get you out for a shoot once I cool off a little.  Sorry for the rant, but being the nice guy has come back to bite me a few times now.  S."
810620,NAW,2013-10-03 00:21:00,4022,Sorry to hear that Sinker.  That guys got some serious go-nads pulling a move like that...
810669,TEP,2013-10-03 02:20:00,68,I'm trying to upload a pic of the new paintjob on the boat(with my iPhone) how do I resize it?
810670,Skud,2013-10-03 02:24:00,739,Cool! What gun did you buy?
810674,Sinker,2013-10-03 02:28:00,8692,"TEP, get yourself a layout blind. I'd take a guy out on a field hunt, no problem. I'm a little leary about my local water spots, no offense, I don't even take my friends to those spots!  S."
810859,ch312,2013-10-04 02:06:00,1590,"I thank you all for the replies. I look forward to taking you all up on the offers!

Have you considered hunting upland? If so, you're welcome to join the hound and I 15 minutes from Brantford for a day of rabbit and grouse hunting once the snows flies. Maybe even see if we can get a coyote to come play"
811371,TEP,2013-10-07 01:07:00,68,A layout blind? Any suggestions?
811372,TEP,2013-10-07 01:10:00,68,BTW was out yesterday till noon. I didn't get one but my buddy did. Of the shots I could have taken neither were really good. Ill get one next time. Definitely hooked tho!!
