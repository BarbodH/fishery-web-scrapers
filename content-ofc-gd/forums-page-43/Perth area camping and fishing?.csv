1047378,Hack_Fisherman,2019-07-23 01:33:00,720,I might have the opportunity to get away in the Perth area for some camping and fishing one weekend late August Any suggestions for on good places to camp and really nice fishing lakes? I’ll be going solo. Prefer camp sites with hydro as I will need to charge my trolling battery. I’d either be taking my tent trailer and canoe with electric motor or roughing it with a tent and bringing my boat for gas and electric motoring. Both Silver Lake and Sharbot Lake PP’s are all pretty much booked right up (electric sites) Thanks in advance
1047384,smitty55,2019-07-23 02:14:00,928,Have you checked out Charleston Lake PP? 20km East to Smith Falls then a half hour south gets you to the village or a tad further around the lake to get to the park itself. It also has water access campgrounds but there wouldn't be hydro there. Lakeline Lodge has cabins for rent as well and possibly some camping spots. Kelsey's trailer park is right there as well. It's a gorgeous lake. https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/charlestonlake https://lakelinelodge.com/  Cheers 
1047432,Hack_Fisherman,2019-07-24 02:05:00,720,"Thanks, I hadn’t considered that one but it does look like a beautiful lake. I’ve picked a tough weekend to go it seems, nearly all booked everywhere. I may have to tent it and take my boat with a kicker. Anyone know how fast a trolling motor charges with a Coleman solar panel?"
1047444,Rich Clemens,2019-07-24 09:51:00,3131,"MUrphy's Point is just outside Perth if I remember correctly.  Never stayed there, but may be worth checking out"
1047447,Terry,2019-07-24 10:46:00,14456,"MUrphy's Point  gives access to Rideau lakes , trout bass pike crappie"
1047473,akaShag,2019-07-24 14:43:00,2073,"Yes, very close to Perth, between Rideau Ferry and Perth.  Don't recall if they have electrical sites."
1047475,Terry,2019-07-24 15:31:00,14456,yes they have power to some sites link its about 8 km to the ferry by boat seems there was a fish sanctuary near the park  maybe im thinking of somewhere else  check regs. if you stay there
1047512,Rich Clemens,2019-07-25 00:11:00,3131,"We fished out of Rideau Ferry for quite a few years.  Lots of hammer handles, but did quite well on bass. LM and SM.    Haven't been there for about 5 years or so though"
1047514,Terry,2019-07-25 00:22:00,14456,"yup, family had a cottage at the Ferry right beside the yacht club, which was really just a boat ramp at the time , but spent some good times fishing there"
1047517,Hack_Fisherman,2019-07-25 01:25:00,720,"Thanks guys, lots to look into here"
1047546,Sinker,2019-07-25 12:55:00,8692,"Check out some marinas and trailer parks in the area. Lots of great places in the land o lakes. Frontenac county has some awesome camp sites as well, but no hydro. S."
1047593,Hack_Fisherman,2019-07-25 23:03:00,720,Thanks again  anyone know how long it takes for a small solar panel to charge a deep cycle battery in optimal conditions?
1047612,irishfield,2019-07-26 04:13:00,26272,8 weeks..
1047617,Terry,2019-07-26 10:11:00,14456,8 weeks with 24 hr a day sunlight
1047663,Hack_Fisherman,2019-07-26 22:08:00,720,"Wow, that’s pitiful. You guys serious??"
1047664,Terry,2019-07-26 22:18:00,14456,Yes most small solar panels put out less then one amh so it will charge a battery 1 amp every hour of full direct sunlight if it put out 1 amp under perfect conditions ..so say 15 hours of sunlight today  you raise the battery by 14 amps  on a dead 120 amp battery so  8 days to charge full but if clouds much longer 
1047677,Hack_Fisherman,2019-07-27 03:42:00,720,"Wow, that’s not worth it. I can get full sized panels for a couple hundred bucks. I wonder how well they would work. (Not for camping per se, but for daily charging at home"
1047681,Terry,2019-07-27 10:47:00,14456,You need minimum 50 watt panel and daylight  it is hard to fish all day and then try to charge with only a few hour of daylight left..chargers charge over night  solar doesnt
1047685,Hack_Fisherman,2019-07-27 12:24:00,720,I have a few deep cycle batteries that I can cycle through the day
1047691,Terry,2019-07-27 13:34:00,14456,that will work minimum 50 watts ...   not millwatts
