1047870,gino,2019-07-31 01:47:00,400,"Hey Brian, that's a great set up you have . Can't get any closer to the water. Nice lakers also. How do you deal with those speed boats darting on the water?? ??"
1047882,misfish,2019-07-31 10:01:00,29133,Thanks  There was a bass tourny on. . They were out sat and sun. I have my net way up in the air. Hope they see it. ?  I found it funny that all the boats went to the  east side. Guess there are no bass on the west side. LOL

1047929,Old Ironmaker,2019-08-01 02:50:00,8243,"Brian I was leery to open this thread. If I  read Broke Back anything I think of the movie Brokeback Mountain Ever seen it? you should. Great video though, you sure have a Pro set up there. Way to go Go Pro. Have you ever heard the saying?  ""You have a face for radio."" "
1047930,AKRISONER,2019-08-01 03:05:00,5558,"I wonder if the Johnstons fished the west side ? Thats a big time bass tourney, big money, big names, and here you are out catching mutated greasers lol The loony tooner strikes again!"
