1004059,Colorcrazy,2017-05-21 17:44:00,1,Anyone catch any big fish in Canal Lake?  We went there for the first time and all we got is weeds.  
1004062,Big Cliff,2017-05-21 18:34:00,6899,"There are walleye and (I am told) pike. 3/8 oz jig and a white grub should, do put some fish in the boat for you"
1004099,danteiv,2017-05-22 02:11:00,28,"Never caught walleye, but I do caught bass (large and small mouth) there last season."
1004122,Rizzo,2017-05-22 03:13:00,4754,"haven't fished there in years, but we did find it riddled with hammerhandle pike when I was last there (20 years ago?)"
1004133,buick14,2017-05-22 12:45:00,741,There are some good fish in there if you know where to look...
1048099,cdub,2019-08-06 02:30:00,2,"Heading up for a quick trip this weekend.  Either to Canal Lake or Dalrymple.  Fishing with my two boys, all catch and release but want it to be fairly productive.  Which lake would you pick? "
1048103,ehg,2019-08-06 10:00:00,2666,"Dalryrmple by far. Caught crappie on small bass topwaters there. Smallish lake north end better less weed,"
1048112,cdub,2019-08-06 12:42:00,2,"Thanks ehg,  will Balsam be more productive or just be a bigger lake?  Sorry, usually I am much further north. "
1048114,Reef Runner,2019-08-06 13:27:00,980,My folks live on the lake and I fish it at least once-twice a month.  There are big bass in Canal.  Both smallies and largemouth. The pike population cooled off a bit from years before.  Walleye are pretty much non-existent; I've caught maybe 5 the past ten years.  It's a shallow lake so the best fishing is on overcast days; bright blue-bird skies like we had this past long weekend the fish will be buried in the weeds hiding from the sun.  It's an awesome lake if you're bringing kids for pan fish as they are everywhere and non-stop action with a simple worm under a float.
1048327,David Chong,2019-08-12 00:13:00,836,We fish a Pike tournament there every year hosted by the Aurora Bassmasters and the pike population seems pretty stable with some in the 10+ lbs. range! Bass fishing should still be pretty good but the walleye population as in most of the Kawarthas is down! it is a weedy lake though! LOL
