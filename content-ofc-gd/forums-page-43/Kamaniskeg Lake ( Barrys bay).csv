1047697,tomO,2019-07-27 15:35:00,363,Was talking to a friend that said he fished there back in the 80s. Just wondering how the fishing was now a days. If anyone is familiar with it. Thanks

1048207,AKRISONER,2019-08-07 17:59:00,5558,decent bass fishing for sure.
1048210,Reef Runner,2019-08-07 18:14:00,980,Spent entire summers there (Polish family).  Lew's right about Wilno Tavern...check it out. Kaminiskeg is a great bass fishery.  We also did well with lakers down rigging gang trolls with a minnow threaded on the end.
1048212,dave524,2019-08-07 20:50:00,4508,I haven't been to Barry's Bay in over 50 years but what I do remember is that every business seemed to be owned by some one with the name Yakabuski ?
