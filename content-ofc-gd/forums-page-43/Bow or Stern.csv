1047968,wkrp,2019-08-02 13:34:00,656,Which is your your office on your boat. Personally I prefer the stern.
1047969,grimsbylander,2019-08-02 14:01:00,3016,I guess it would depend more on the boats layout and what type of fishing your doing. For me it’s the bow.
1047970,dave524,2019-08-02 14:30:00,4508,"I ran a centre console, so neither ?"
1047971,misfish,2019-08-02 14:53:00,29133,So do I. Mine is port side. ?
1047973,jimmer,2019-08-02 16:14:00,2730,"Depends if I have to use the bow mount.  I find I use it less now that I'm getting older.  I tend to like to drift around with my feet up, so I would sit in the stern."
1047974,porkpie,2019-08-02 16:15:00,2521,"Im a troller, I’m at the back of the boat 80% of the time."
1047976,DRIFTER_016,2019-08-02 18:12:00,10439,When I need to use my TM I just drop it into the water and chill with the remote hanging around my neck. ? If had one of those fancy new auto deploy jobs I wouldn't even have to get it up off my butt!!!!   ?
1047978,kickingfrog,2019-08-02 19:46:00,8333,Depends on how much alcohol has been consumed. 
1047979,jimmer,2019-08-02 20:08:00,2730,"Well, that must be nice.  That's exactly what I need, just a little dear for me."
1047980,Sinker,2019-08-02 20:42:00,8692,I run everything from the tiller.  S.
1047981,lew,2019-08-02 20:53:00,12766,I was primarily a caster so I was always at the bow. 
1047982,Rizzo,2019-08-02 21:47:00,4754,mainly trolling...so at the console
1047983,misfish,2019-08-02 21:59:00,29133, Baggy pants Lew.
1047985,lew,2019-08-02 22:27:00,12766,You gotta have freedom to move fast when those big slimers come out to play Brian LOL
1047986,misfish,2019-08-02 23:20:00,29133,"Thats why I wear them baggy shorts Lew.  They work as a towel after landing them greasers.  Sometimes I have to take them off for a wash out there, but hey, no ones watching. ?"
1048087,BillM,2019-08-05 22:02:00,17367,Bow for sure.
