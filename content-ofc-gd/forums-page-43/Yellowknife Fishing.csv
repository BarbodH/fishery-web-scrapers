1047765,DRIFTER_016,2019-07-29 14:54:00,10439,There's one or two in town. When you going to be up here?
1047776,ketchenany,2019-07-29 16:36:00,3229,"Dave  will exchange construction help for guiding, Just a thought Dave!"
1047815,DRIFTER_016,2019-07-30 04:12:00,10439,I'll take him out anyway. As long as he doesn't mind down rigging for lakers. As long as our schedules match up.  
1047816,smitty55,2019-07-30 04:33:00,928,"If he's smart he'd take you up on that offer, I sure would."
1047822,misfish,2019-07-30 10:46:00,29133,Now that is an offer I would not pass up on. Do you not jig for them as well Dave ?
1047857,DRIFTER_016,2019-07-30 20:58:00,10439,I do but when I find a good  concentration of them. Last night would have been a good night for jigging but I took my jig rods out of the boat as I have been doing well downrigging. Last night they were super active and aggressive. They were coming up 30 or more to hit my spoon. Had 3 smack the cannon ball.
