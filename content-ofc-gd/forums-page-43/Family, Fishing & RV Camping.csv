I know it's last minute but I'm hoping to get out for 4 - 5 days with the family for some relaxation and maybe to do a little fishing. Being that it's so late, most of the (well known) provincial parks are full. Hoping to find somewhere quiet to bring the trailer(within 3-4 hours of Toronto, maybe a bit more if it's worth it) do a little fishing with the kids. Any suggestions? I have a small zodiac, being able to fish from that would be a bonus."
