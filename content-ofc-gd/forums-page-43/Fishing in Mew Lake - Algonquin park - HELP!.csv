1047476,Jds63,2019-07-24 15:36:00,1365,its not much more than a backyard pond ... better off hiking into Provoking and trying your luck there
1047497,woodenboater,2019-07-24 19:13:00,2277,"only if you want to stare at the line all day. there *may* be some itsy bitsy panfish, but really not worth the effort. as well as provoking (never fished it), I'd try the madawaska river. lots of pools and eddies. pretty scenic as well."
1047588,lgkhan,2019-07-25 21:25:00,6,Thank you so much. I appreciate your feedback. as woodenboater suggested i will try madawaska ﻿river.. Once again Thank you so much for your time.
1047599,lgkhan,2019-07-26 01:16:00,6,madawaska﻿ ﻿river is far from Algonquin park. i might try some other time. Any good fishing spot in Algonquin park ? Please advise.
1047607,woodenboater,2019-07-26 03:06:00,2277,"the Madawaska starts in the Park and runs to the Ottawa River. It flows right beside the campground, more or less. take the trail to Provoking and you'll cross it. follow it upstream and it'll take you to Cache Lake, after passing through a number of smaller bodies."
1047608,lgkhan,2019-07-26 03:09:00,6,Thank you very much for your prompt reply. Highly appreciated.
1047625,woodenboater,2019-07-26 12:52:00,2277,"my bad. don't take the bike trail that takes you to Provoking (and eventually Rock Lake). You're going to want to turn right at the rail bed (might be signs saying Track and Tower xx kms away). You'll come to a bridge that will take you across the river. There might be a trail to Starling Lake, but I've never walked that one."
