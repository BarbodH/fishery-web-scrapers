1046749,AKRISONER,2019-07-06 22:50:00,5558,I was not aware a perch tournament existed? Is it catch and release like a bass tournament? Artificial bait only?

1046751,grimsbylander,2019-07-06 23:54:00,3016,"I know I’m contradicting the masses here but imho, upsizing baits between now and late September isn’t key. After the water cools (turnover) is the time to upsize baits. The cooler water gets the fall feed bag going and fish want maximum calorie intake per meal. During the summer months, get your bait in areas not normally hit by the average angler and make sure your tackle is prepped for big fish. Regrets last a very long time."
1046753,grimsbylander,2019-07-07 00:05:00,3016,"This is why you got the reaction you did for the Erie comment. Not because Erie guys are overly sensitive, but because you have no experience with the lake, understanding of its features or how it’s fished. I was fishing Gbay while you were still on the boob so I know exactly what the differences are between the two lakes. Anglers that are unfamiliar with Erie fly right by a 1 foot ledge on the graph because they’re  looking for a Gbay style dropoff. On Erie, that spot will hold fish. So it’s not featureless, it’s just not as obvious to the untrained eye. Personally, I like 6lb smallies regardless of what structure they’re holding on "
1046760,AKRISONER,2019-07-07 02:52:00,5558,"I quite literally had no idea that perch tournaments existed, I know there’s “perch festivals” and “perch derbies” where you either catch tagged perch, or i guess there may be a prize for a biggest fish, but they have always just been kind of free for all’s. Kids categories etc etc i had no idea there were FLW MLF BASS BFL bass style tournaments for perch."
1046763,Garnet,2019-07-07 11:38:00,2056,The 60Hp and under series had the 1st crappie tournament I'm aware of on Percy Boom. I won it seems to me it was 2K for 20 crappie. Then they had Simcoe Perch/Crappie I was 3rd. Then Rice think I was 8th witch was huge disappointment. Lots of the bass clubs have perch and crappie tournaments my Port Perry club had both for about 12 years you weight your 15 and can keep your eaters. I can only guess that I won 8-10 so each likely paid 4-500. And really good perch/crappie anglers.
1046780,AKRISONER,2019-07-07 22:13:00,5558,"Definitely knew about the crappie tourneys the Americans down south are intense. The guys in Alabama we’re fishing them on spider rigs and especially at night with big LED set ups all stuff that’s not even legal in canada. down in South Carolina they punch for em on huge poles. I’d never seen anything like it, punching heavy surface vegetation (maybe hyacin *spelling I have no clue) with a float and a 10 foot noodle rod. Rods, tackle, etc  id never ever seen before seeing it in person."
1046784,Garnet,2019-07-08 08:18:00,2056,I retired from the bigger Crappie/Perch Tourneys after the 1st year and only fished clubys. Because all that 1st year I ate no crappie and only fall perch. When my club Port Perry Bassmasters started crappie/perch tourneys I pushed the weight your 15 and keep your eaters. O I was Pres. NGTA has a big open perch tourney think guaranteed money also keep your eaters.
1046785,msp,2019-07-08 12:46:00,1336,The number one big bass bait of all time is a flipping jig with trailer. Try a 1/2 oz flipping jig in brown or black and blue with a zoom chunk. Stick with it and be confident. I guarantee you will catch the big ones with it. 
1046790,AKRISONER,2019-07-08 14:29:00,5558,"i never had confidence in the jig until this year when i just decided to force myself to use it until i caught fish because if its that notoriously famous its gotta work...sure enough, all of sudden you are like wow, this bait that i never though could work is actually one of the most simple yet versatile ways to fish, you can flip jigs into absolute crap, or fish em deep. They catch big fish, they catch small fish even though they seem huge. Ive been loving throwing brown with blue with a nice craw trailer. I use craws with the floating claws, it just gives it that extra wobble when it hits the ground."
1046809,Whitespinnerbait,2019-07-08 22:44:00,2038,???
1046843,msp,2019-07-09 13:21:00,1336,"The flipping jig is very versatile. you can fish it deep, shallow, fast , slow. experimenting with weight and rate of fall is more important than colour. 5/16 oz 1/2 oz and 9/16 oz are all standard weights. switching out your chunk/trailer makes a huge difference with the rate of fall. For example, a 5/16 oz jig with a large trailer with flapping craw type trailer will have a very slow fall rate. This was key for me last weekend to getting bites. Sometimes it the exact opposite. a 9/16 oz jig with a small chunk with little action could be what the fish want. ( more of a reaction bite ) as the fish don't have time to inspect and just react to the fast fall. Sketty55- PM sent"
1046878,David Chong,2019-07-10 01:30:00,836,"The Mark Mckeown Memorial Perch Tournament takes place every April on Lake Simcoe, artificial baits only!"
1046879,David Chong,2019-07-10 01:32:00,836,"As for the original question, a flipping jig would be my first choice and other options that I like would be a Chatterbait or large Swimbait! Then throw it to where the BIG Girls live which is usually the thickest cover available!"

1046886,SirCranksalot,2019-07-10 11:56:00,3291,"Are you guys talking about reg lead or tungsten jigs used for walleye etc, or something special for bass. Also, what's a typical trailer? thx"

1046889,AKRISONER,2019-07-10 13:00:00,5558,Wanna know how to fish bass? These guys have more information than any person should ever know.  
1047088,OhioFisherman,2019-07-15 04:03:00,6623,"I don't think there is one lure to use, although I normally had a rod or two set up with some type of jig and trailer combo on them, location seems to be more of a factor to me. Our club fished a lake in New York annually that was only around 300 acres in size, and most years the winning bag came from the same area."
1047394,colin519,2019-07-23 13:29:00,101,"Run a search bait like a 1/8oz  jig and minnow that will hook up easily and let you figure out structure.  Fish through the area and then return with your big plastics 10-30 minutes later 6” senko, fished as slow as possible, target casts to sighted fish or long casts to undisturbed water, this is why you fish through once, so you can return and fish with purpose. I find it’s important to drift in quietly, cast to in new water with a soft plastic. In the summer the bite during the day can slow down, so those bigger senkos will produce more big fish than say a crawfish bait or a tube because are a big soft bodied meal with low risk. Big bass in the summer are not always aggressive because insects and crustacean type food is available so keep those plastics easy to consume. The most recent big bass I’ve seen caught on one of my trips was on a 1” purple twister tail with a tiny 1/16 Oz jig head. It was about 5 inches from a rock beside short in 18 inches of water and was 5.5lbs-6lbs. I was fishing with a friend who was using a stiff cheap bass rod, and bunch of big ‘american’ bass baits, 15lb test. I put him on a 5’6” st croix ultralight with that 1” jig and he caught it. Look at the patterning you’ve done. Chances are between your info and these tips you can find a pattern for next time. Two rods can help a lot, also I use 4lb, 6lb or 8lb mono max OR buy an ultralight rod so that every 4lb bass becomes a 6lb bass. Anything that makes it more likely for a wary fish to feel comfortable.  Another tip: more oxygen entering the water, the fish will be more energetic. A spring or river fed bay can be fished more aggressively than a back bay in my experience."
1047403,fish_fishburn,2019-07-23 16:32:00,1311,First I long cast the white mouse or rat and reel it in really fast. Any blowups get the follow up a 5 inch flipping tube rigged weedless on a 5/0 GWG or a 10 inch black worm rigged the same way as the tube. Oh yeah and hang on brother.
1047420,Sketty55,2019-07-24 00:23:00,52,"Hey all. I just got back from my trip and wanted to thank you all for the suggestions. This year, the bass were smaller than normal....the biggest i hooked in to was about 3lbs. I tried chatterbaits (not hits), chatterbait with a shrimp as the trailer (I saw a guy get a big smallie last weekend at simcoe using an uncooked pink shrimp....no hits), larger topwater frog in the pads (decent amount of hits but hooking in to them was another story). I had the most luck on orange\copper senko's. My buddy got another 6lb'er on the opener and showed me a pic. I think it's time for new friends. lol."
1047431,grimsbylander,2019-07-24 02:03:00,3016,"Still sounds like you had a blast! Awesome. Want a pig, throw a jig."
1046484,Sketty55,2019-07-02 14:51:00,52,"Hi all. I have a friend with a cottage on a private lake just north of Bancroft. It's a small lake full of largemouth and every year he sends out a pic of his big catch which looks to be around 7lbs. I only get up there once a year and have good success on senko's and scum frog's in the morning, however these have been more in the 3-4lb range. I'm hoping to target one of the trophy size fish, so my question is.....what lure and technique do you suggest for that big bass? I went to Cabela's and the staff suggested using a larger topwater frog like a Lunkerhunt. After reading a few articles online I see suggestions for larger swimbaits, jig and trailer combo's but I really have no idea else to try. My time is limited out there, so I won't have time to experiment with everything. My buddy caught his on mostly different lures each time."
1046486,grimsbylander,2019-07-02 15:35:00,3016,I would have to show you in person. ?
1046497,lunkerbasshunter,2019-07-02 17:52:00,2585,"large baits for sure. You may not catch many but the ones you do will be big.  If you read up on the lakes that produce large bass over 10lbs in the US they all use huge baits.  Large swim baits, small snake like baits.  All that said, nothing wrong with a day of 3-4lbers on regular sized baits. Cheers"
1046502,KawarthaAngler,2019-07-02 18:13:00,273,If live bait is allowed ... large minnows.  Big ones.  Large bass will smash them if you are in the spot.
1046509,Garnet,2019-07-02 19:10:00,2056,The best fish will own the best areas. The bait you use will be secondary to finding the right area. And the area will repeat.
1046510,Musky Plug,2019-07-02 19:40:00,398,"X2. This has been my experience as well. Locations are primary, baits and presentation are secondary."
1046512,AKRISONER,2019-07-02 19:55:00,5558,"gotta know the ""big bass spots"" they for whatever reason always seem to produce. As weird as it is any time ive hit a 20lb bag or close to it its been within a small range of water. Go outside of that range and you will never have the same consistency. When i think about it overall, its probably just because that structure and area is just literally the best area of the lake for the fish with access to every single kind of structure, bait, water temperature and hiding spots. its like the perfect storm."
1046514,Big Cliff,2019-07-02 20:00:00,6899,"We have been having really good success using large (7"") plastics, and a rather large plastic craw fish. we try to get them in tight to the weed edges or into pockets in the weeds. A couple of small pieces of split shot helps get them to drop deeper into the weeds and we rig them up so they are weedless. Works for us!"
1046519,misfish,2019-07-02 20:36:00,29133,"We could team and give him all our knowledge. LOL Spinner baits,buzz baits. Works for me. Deep weed pockets jig and pig."
1046522,grimsbylander,2019-07-02 20:52:00,3016,There's a solid 10 minutes!!!
1046525,aplumma,2019-07-02 21:20:00,6896,Location is key and getting the bait to the fish is just as important. Some of the biggest bass I have caught have been deep in the slop. I like to find coontail weeds that have open pockets  and lower a 3/4 oz pig and jig down in and jump it around. another area is under docks and blow downs. As you look at the lay of the land look for points and channels if you do not have a depth finder then you can usually visualize what the land leading down to the water most likely continues in that pattern.  If I have no idea what is going to work them I use a fast search bait like a spinner bait or crankbait depending on the weed growth. Once fish are located I will then start to work the area with a slower bait that can get further back into the cover that is around. Art
1046526,misfish,2019-07-02 21:50:00,29133,"I,ll be glad to give my 2 minutes of fame."
1046534,Sketty55,2019-07-02 23:52:00,52,"Great advice, so find the structure and use large baits. The lake is quite small and the water is deep and dark so I can only locate  the pads\weeds (where I have gotten all my fish) and the dock across the lake. I'll give it a shot at the end of the month and post pics....this includes any 1lber's which I hold up right against the camera lens and tell you guys it's 5lb's. lol. Appreciate all of the advice!"
1046544,smithy97,2019-07-03 03:39:00,70,"Upsizing baits is good, but location and timing are everything. Once you have the spot nailed down, try sizing up your bait for the situation you are in at that moment. Example, if you've locked down a big fish spot in the morning, throw a 5'' walking topwater as opposed to a 3.5'', or a 3'' frog instead of a 2''. Throwing a 5-8 inch glide bait is a great option if you have any, like the River 2 Sea s-waver 168 or 200. But, finding where they are holding is everything."
1046574,Sketty55,2019-07-03 17:45:00,52,Just looked up the River 2 Sea s-waver. Looks pretty cool....and big! Where can you buy these in Ontario? I don't see anywhere online and they are out of stock at Bass Pro.
1046578,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-03 18:27:00,8243,"Big bait big fish. Live bait might be cheatin'""to some, not  I. C&R anyway. Find good healthy green coontail and and cabbage then you will find the big Moma's. They got big for a reason, they aren't fooled by hardware or plastics."

1046718,smithy97,2019-07-06 12:52:00,70,"Check smaller shops that carry JDM stuff, like Megabass, Duo Realis, etc. Often these stores will have swimbaits from different brands there. I believe you could order the bait thru Cabelas or Bass Pro site and have it delivered to your place. I order everything from Tackle Warehouse or other American sites when they run sales. Then I ship to a shipping depot in Port Huron MI and go over and pick them up myself."
1046719,Garnet,2019-07-06 12:56:00,2056,I've won many perch tournaments usually takes 15 big perch or crappie never on live bait.
