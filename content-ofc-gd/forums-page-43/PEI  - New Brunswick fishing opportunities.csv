1040567,fishdawg,2019-02-19 03:13:00,912,"Hey all, been a while... Family road trip happening in August.  Was wondering what fishing opportunities could be available, preferably saltwater from shore? Dont really want to book a big charter. Possibly could be interested in maybe getting on a small boat or a couple hours of jigging perhaps. Staying a few days each in Sackville NB, and Sherbrook PEI. Thanks! Dawg"
1040569,bigugli,2019-02-19 04:13:00,6138,In PEI get on one of the party boats for mackeral
1040570,pics,2019-02-19 06:42:00,1268,I will be there in August as well.. Usually when I go to Nova Scotia I fish off the wharf for flounder. I am bringing my fishing rod with me so I am also interested in places to fish at that time of year..
1040575,fishdawg,2019-02-19 14:14:00,912,Right on What set up /bait would you use for flounder and/or other wharf species?
1040579,bigugli,2019-02-19 18:22:00,6138,"In summer months, it's all about timing.  Don't know if you could still get squid off the docks in August. That is a hoot in itself.  Find rivers and streams running into the ocean and fish the tidewaters in the surf. Ron Ferguson would be the only go to I have left on good spots down east. All the rest have passed on."
1040580,craigdritchie,2019-02-19 19:46:00,1586,"We have a summer house in PEI, there are lots of opportunities for mackerel, flounder, sea-run brookies and stripers. Shoot me a PM, let me know where you'll be and when, and I can point you in the right direction."
1040581,John,2019-02-19 19:48:00,2956,We were in PEI in September and went out on party boat for mackerel and Cod. Not a big mackerel fan unless they are on the barbie but the cod were amazing.
1040582,misfish,2019-02-19 21:12:00,29133,Are you just traveling and staying at hotel/motel or B&B out there ? Would like to hear how your trip went when you return.
1040635,scuro2,2019-02-21 02:44:00,904,"Apparently there are Muskie in one NB river. Mackerel,...if you hit it right, tossing Cleos will get you as many Mackerel as you want. Giant schools of them right from the dock."
1040649,pics,2019-02-21 16:20:00,1268,I go to the grocery store to get fresh live clams. Use a good weight to get your bait to the bottom and the flounder will find it..
1040655,misfish,2019-02-21 17:50:00,29133,Do you drill a small hole to  put on the hook ?
1040659,fishdawg,2019-02-21 21:53:00,912,"great thanks everyone! we are staying a few days with friends in NB then a couple days at a motel in Cavendish PEI. Getting a cod, striper and flounder would be pretty cool!"
1040660,lew,2019-02-21 22:24:00,12766,"Have a great trip Mark, the Maritimes are fantastic and Diane and I are  heading back down again in September for  our second trip in 2 years."
1040686,BillM,2019-02-22 16:01:00,17367,"Tuna opens Aug 1st, I'd pay the $$$ to go and catch one of those monsters."
1040689,fishdawg,2019-02-22 16:57:00,912,"Thanks Lew hope your keeping well. Bill,tuna will definitely happen but next time."
1040692,Garnet,2019-02-22 19:47:00,2056,Pugwash pier mackerel on high tide. Just a 6-6 spinning rod and those flea flicer flys with a bell sinker. Worked on most creeks couple years ago. The Pugwash pier has a live camera on it so you can watch for action.
1040719,David Chong,2019-02-23 13:51:00,836,"The Striper fishing when the run is on is insane down east! I'll be down at the New Brunswick Sportsman Show at the end of March, will see what else is worthwhile!"
1040746,misfish,2019-02-23 22:43:00,29133," Looking at their floor plan, Barrie could take a lesson from it. I have always said to use the outer walk around."
1040760,pics,2019-02-24 11:37:00,1268,Bring a small rock to smash the shell.. Yeah it gets a little ugly..
1046824,fishdawg,2019-07-09 02:42:00,912,Hey Craig please check your inbox for PM
1047755,BrentS89,2019-07-29 02:44:00,13,A couple years back we were in NB casting off the pier and catching mackerel on bare 3/0 chrome treble hooks. Put two on a line with a sinker and jig the line as you reel in. Lots of fun bringing two fish in at a time.
