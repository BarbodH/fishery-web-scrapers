1047790,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-29 21:17:00,8243,100's of fish? I don't get that.  Maybe restate the sentence. Operators are whom? Sort of like when the Firefighters here in town hold their annual Perch Fry. Who is in possession of the several hundred Perch? Last year I was told they served over 300 folks and each plate had 5  Perch. That's over 1500 Perch. Mortality rate was 100%!!!
1047792,G.mech,2019-07-29 21:32:00,830,And they were commercially caught fish so recreational limits do not apply.
1047823,Garnet,2019-07-30 11:01:00,2056,The live release boat has 1 or maybe 2 people working on it. There limit would be 6 bass each or in an walleye tournament 4 each. So the permit allows them to posses all the fish for live release purposes. That maybe 100's of fish. I will not comment on what happen this time except it's fixable. 
1048145,David Chong,2019-08-06 21:37:00,836,"WOW, I could write a novel about this but I'll try to keep it direct to the point! Tournaments are not perfectly but most strive to do the best that they can as far as fish care is concerned as do tournament anglers. I have fished quite a few tournaments over the years and the vast majority of them are very well run and live release rate is very high. I really do hope that this is blimp that happened for a wide variety of reasons that I am not 100% privy to because I was not there. I have talked to many who were but will not pass on those comments as things can get twisted very quickly! I just returned from the Thousand Islands Open and were there a few fish lost? Yes, but Dr. Bruce Tufts and his students from Queens University were there to help with the fish care. The fish that did expire were kept for research purposes at Tuft's lab. The limits at this tournament was reduced to 4 fish this year in order to put less fish at risk. No one cares about this fishery than the anglers themselves. If you were to inspect the boats at this event, I can guarantee you that the anglers did everything possible to keep their fish alive. They have the properly functioning live wells, outfitted with additional aerators, Oxygenators, foam covers and bilge pumps with hoses to obtain water from beneath the surface. They carry loads of ice and additives like G-Juice, they are all well versed in fizzing fish when they suffer from barotrauma. All this being said, the B1 event is definitely not the norm especially on the Canadian side of the border! But this will bring more attention to proper fish care and higher standards that all tournament organizations should be held to! BTW anybody who fishes bass deep on larger bodies on water should know how to fizz a bass, this is probably one of the best videos demonstrating this procedure: "
1048148,Fisherman,2019-08-06 21:47:00,7201,"Admit it, if it wasn't for the money and bragging rights, I'm sure there wouldn't be as much interest.  As much as fish in general may be on the low end of the proverbial totem pole, they are a food source for other species.  I find it sad that man has to go around ""just because"" he can, wasting a resource.  If they were required to keep what they catch with no culling and injuring fish, there's still 4,5 or 6 fish to tally up and enter.  Then go eat them. Oh, for those who wonder, I'm not a P3TA freak, if I catch some, I eat them, unless they're out of the legal size."
1047637,jimmer,2019-07-26 15:08:00,2730,"I always liked the idea of smaller limits for tournaments, even if it's just when the conditions are not suitable. "
1047641,grimsbylander,2019-07-26 16:24:00,3016,"Exactly. My point remains, there are other ways to mitigate risk of dying fish versus targeting the concept of catch and release tournaments."
1047666,BillM,2019-07-26 23:01:00,17367,"No need to be driving around with a livewell full of fish all day.   Why not a marshal for each boat, weigh and release?"
1047676,OhioFisherman,2019-07-27 03:37:00,6623," https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=28+degrees+celsius   Weather was sunny and 28 degrees celsius on both days.  From the link, hot but not really excessively for days in July. Our club had a tournament on Sandusky Bay years ago off of Lake Erie, we had a self imposed area limit that only allowed us to fish in the bay itself and not go onto the main lake. Another bigger tournament launched from the same ramp as us and they had no area limits and most went out into Lake Erie for the big smallies. We were headed to the ramp shortly after the big tournament ended and their fish were released, a lot of the big smallies they had released, 4+ pound fish, were struggling on the surface of the water getting picked apart by seagulls, either not fizzed or not properly fizzed. 20 years ago we had self imposed 3 fish limits on some waters of Lake Erie, but we didn't have sponsors to keep happy with impressive catches of 25+ pound bags of bass? I fished a tournament years ago at Mosquito Lake here, it was sponsored in part by that areas local Walmart. So after launching at the state park, fishing all day, you had to trailer your boat, er and fish to the weigh in at the Walmart store 3-4 miles from the lake? Never fished that one again, just seemed more risk to the fish than I wanted to be a part of? Because you can run 60 or 80 miles on some bodies of water is it the best plan for maintaining a healthy fish population?"
1047687,dave524,2019-07-27 12:56:00,4508,These mortality numbers do not take in the numbers of culled fish during the day who don't make it. Is any competitor going to keep a smaller fish when a larger is caught even if it's survival is questionable ?
1047689,dave524,2019-07-27 13:27:00,4508,"I recall years ago a big pro bass tourney out of Port Colborne, seems more than a few boats at blastoff made the run to Long Point targeting largies, so they got released at the end of the day with the smallies at Port Colborne, not really a good idea in my estimation."
1047690,woodenboater,2019-07-27 13:34:00,2277,"Went to the Bassmaster Classic in Lake Hartwell in 2015 and iirc, they had to drive back to Greenville for the weigh ins. That's a hella long drive with fish in the live well. Large and smallies looked fine and feisty at the weigh in...but still and still wish Ike had come out on top"
1047693,dave524,2019-07-27 13:42:00,4508,"At least that is illegal here in Canada, transporting live fish overland."
1047694,woodenboater,2019-07-27 13:49:00,2277,"I never asked, but am presuming this is how the fish got to the final day weigh ins. It was a big show with everyone sitting in their boats that were trailered into the arena. People went crazy when the local had his haul weighed. Insane. and Mercer was the emcee so he really got the crowd pumped ! Hopefully someone with BM Classic experience can fill us in if I got it wrong."
1047695,Terry,2019-07-27 13:56:00,14456,its only illegal in canada without a permit i did a tourney some years ago and they did have a permit and the final weigh in was at another location
1047720,b_cdot,2019-07-28 09:12:00,270,Maybe I read this wrong but what is the point of cooling your tank down to 13 degrees? Youre taking bass from a livewell that might be cooled by ice or might be continually aerated. It's not likely one of those livewells was 13 degrees when they got to weigh in. Whatever fish made it to the tanks was probably then killed from over chilling those tanks. I could be totally wrong but too much ice can kill fish just as quick as not enough. Mortality rate was actually higher the 2nd day they decided to cool the water even more. I've fished a few tournaments and unfortunately I've also had fish die. I am always caring for my fish and always trying to find new ways to take better care of them. This is the part of tournament fishing that sometimes makes me not want to participate anymore.
1047721,Garnet,2019-07-28 10:57:00,2056,Well I don't have Basmasters Classic experience. I was part of both Bassmania Classics that we trailered to Memorial Park in Peterbourgh. We weight our fish at Bensfort Bridge  and then top 10 trailered to arena for the big show. Most boats where provide a Rapala portable air . I always carried one with clips to run off battery's. I was last boat to trailer both years and don't remember being offered the rapala one. So my boat had the recuirc and my Mr Bubbles plus ice and cosser  salt. Both years my fish where in good shape but the fish where already weight so my big worry was over. You don't win tournaments with dead fish penalties.
1047725,woodenboater,2019-07-28 13:31:00,2277,thanks Garnet. I imagine the Classic would be run similarly. Can't recall if they also had weigh ins at the launch leading up to the final day.
1047726,colin519,2019-07-28 14:46:00,101,"I agree. I'm thinking a combination of long days, the temperature changes you mentioned and people not pumping enough water in on long runs with big fish in the wells all day. Those fish are expelling waste into those tanks and if you are doing a long run back without pumping water then the oxygen is gonna be lower.  Imagine an aquarium in the size of a toolbox, put it in a greenhouse, cover the top and add 5 more big fish and that's a livewell....Imagine how big a fish tank you'd need to keep a 5lb smallie at home healthy in an aquarium... How many boats pumped before the run back? Or even the most concerned anglers would probably flip it to recirculation and drive back with out stopping"
1047730,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-28 16:54:00,8243,I've only gotten through 1/2 the article about the Bass Guru Mike Long and am enthralled to say the least. As well as the forensic investigation by Mr. Roelofsen and Akrisoner concerning the young woman and her claims. I  have been a member here for around 10 years I think. This has to be one of the most interesting if not the most interesting threads we have ever had in my opinion.
1047760,Garnet,2019-07-29 13:20:00,2056,"Bassmasters doesn't have on site weight they do have a person look in livewells so they can coordinate the weight in show. The last few years they bring the leader up on hot seat and weight fisherman 9-2 much more realistic. In most tournaments the anglers are responsible for the fish until the are weight in. From that point on, if the angler got no penalty's the promoter has the reasonability. Stopping to refill livewells is common with all bassboats they all lose water. It's just another thing you take into account. I also carried the wife's pee bucket so when I stop pumps on max and manual bucket. Most big water guys have those sponge matts cut so the float on top of livewell water to stop sloshing. What I'm saying is angler will do what ever necessary to get fish in alive. Unfortunately all these little things are learned usually the hard way. My 30 years of tournament fishing I can remember about 5 dead fish penalty's."
1047761,Rattletrap2,2019-07-29 13:36:00,1652,"I have followed tournament Bass fishing since the mid '80's and always enjoyed seeing the fish. Personally, I don't have enough competitive spirit in me to want to fish one myself! lol I would say that ""seeing"" the fish is the major reason why I fish! I snorkel a lot to do just that! As of this past couple of years, I became a huge fan of Major League Fishing on TV. Those fish are released immediately. Granted the cost of having camera crews and scrutineers in each boat would cost them more than the way these B1 and other tourney's are run, but the mighty dollar should not dictate what is good for the industry and the reputation of tourney's in my opinion. I looked at the photo's of the young woman holding up those fish in all different (sponsor themed) outfits. Just pathetic! Unfortunately, this is what the fishing industry wants though. Anyways, very interesting thread, but also very infuriating!"
1047766,_al87_outdoors,2019-07-29 14:55:00,22,Are the women holding the fish at the end the anglers or are they just for show on the final stage ?
1047767,Terry,2019-07-29 15:09:00,14456,????????????????? dont know what you mean by that
1047768,grimsbylander,2019-07-29 15:22:00,3016,Her pics are not associated with tournament angling. There’s at least three separate topics all running under one article about the mortality rate at one bass tournament. Hence the confusion. Read comments that start with “Garnet” and you’ll be good. ?
1047773,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-29 16:21:00,8243,I am assuming this tourney was not in Ontario. As it was  pointed out it is illegal to transport live fish here in Ontario.
1047774,G.mech,2019-07-29 16:30:00,830,"Only partly true OI, it is illegal to transport live fish over land without a permit.  Many of these tourneys get permits and take special precautions to ensure the fish survive."
1047775,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-29 16:31:00,8243,"Didn't know that, got it thanks."
1047783,Garnet,2019-07-29 20:31:00,2056,"Those permits are why angler responsibility end at your weight in, most tournament. Now the classics where we put them back into livewell and transport them to Memorial Park in Peterbourgh are a little grey area because I remember the legality's being talked about and the 10 boats where under the permit. And the permit is to posses more than a limit. Even in a live release boat the operators might have 100's of fish.   "
1047784,Garnet,2019-07-29 20:41:00,2056,"The typical dead fish penalty is 4oz/per fish so if all your fish where "" fish care penalty's"" (dead Fish) that's 1.4 lbs. You are not winning any tournaments with that loss.  "
1047470,AKRISONER,2019-07-24 14:36:00,5558,"https://fishb1.com/f/st-lawrence-river-report?fbclid=IwAR3svmbOVRCbs8x0F7U_69q2kfEnFm2p9XYSaCyfk6l1NsQ7et9ZldtXmCc  So this happened a couple of weeks ago. Not a good look for tournament fishing at all, 96% mortality rate for smallmouth...ouch IMO its a combo of lack of fizzing by anglers and furthermore something specifically wrong with the live tanks at weigh in. They definitely need to fix this. Holy cow if I was a St Lawrence Bass angler I would be absolutely livid. Not only did they kill 183 bass, they killed 183 of the biggest bass in the area. Not good not good at all."
1047474,Fisherman,2019-07-24 15:02:00,7201,Maybe it's time to stop playing C&R with this resource.  Nature paying the price for the amusement of humans.
1047479,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-24 16:04:00,8243,I read the link. There seems to be many steps and procedures' in place to ensure mortality rate is aimed at zero. Something within the entire process from fish first hooked until release has failed. I find the report woefully lacking any data that would explain why. That would include a necropsy be done on many of the fish that died as well as an investigation of all the systems in place to ensure zero mortality. rate.  I know that would cost big bucks. I am sure an investigation of that magnitude is not in a tournaments budget. If it is not then that tournament should not be held. Does the MNR act as a watchdog during these tourney's to ensure mortality rates are zero? Are charges pending? I wouldn't want to be the person that signed on the dotted line on the tournament application. I don't think we have heard the end of this. I hope not.
1047480,grimsbylander,2019-07-24 16:14:00,3016,"Yeah stop catch and release. Just go to catch and keep within the limits of the law...46 teams x2 days with a 5 fish limit = 460 dead fish with a 100% mortality rate. In my opinion, a much more common sense approach would be to regulate limits by the size of the body of water and current weather conditions. I will guarantee that super hot humid weather played a huge role in the mortality rate. Why not run the tournament with a 3 fish limit for example?? People read articles like this and instantly focus on that one number without looking at the big picture. Want to save 183 bass quickly? Cut the catch and keep limits down to 3 fish across the province. You’ll save 183 bass first day on Erie alone!! And every Saturday thereafter. Knee jerk reactions rarely ever work out well. "
1047481,Terry,2019-07-24 16:26:00,14456,As they said most tournaments 1 to 7 % so one blip means nothing they can turn it into a derby and have it catch and keep. They have every right to. 
1047482,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-24 16:34:00,8243,"Who wants to keep and eat a wormy Smallmouth? I will eat smaller bass from Erie but not a 5 pound er here or from a small hot lake up north or a lake or river around here, especially during summer. Regs say if you kill a fish you can't waste it which means eat it to me."
1047483,ecmilley,2019-07-24 16:37:00,2163,Preliminary report I got was oxygen levels were to low in release tanks. . One thing I can say for Andy pollata of the csfl he really cares about the fish and image of tournements and will reschedule if it looks like a highmortality rate or dangerous weather
1047484,OhioFisherman,2019-07-24 16:38:00,6623,"I personally disliked fishing deep ( 20+) feet for smallies or bass in general, just seen too many issues unless they were released very quickly after a catch. I am guessing it was a lack of proper fizzing issues?"
1047486,jimmer,2019-07-24 16:40:00,2730,"It's definitely not the first tournament that had a high mortality rate. I don't think there are any real answers to avoid something like this happening other than cancelling the tournament if the conditions are not suitable for a successful live release (That won't happen!), OR changing the whole structure, which I doubt will happen either due to costs, required volunteers, security, field size, etc. They are what they are until the MNR feels it needs to stop them and I can't see that happening. So many anglers enjoy the competition and will defend tournaments in any way possible. Catch and keep is not an option for tournaments in my opinion. "
1047533,J Roelofsen,2019-07-25 10:18:00,84,"Sounds like temperature shock could have been a factor.... I'm not a huge fan of most tournaments. The entire idea of just doesn't sit well with me. When money and sponsors are on the line the fishery takes a back seat IMO.....just check out these pics I found on a rather popular anglers Instagram page.....yup, same 2 fish with 6 different outfits.....this kind of overhandling and needlessly stressing fish out for a paycheck is perfect ammo for anti fishing groups. If your gonna eat a fish, cool, bonk it and be done. If your gonna release it then snap a quick pic and put it back. Simple.          "

Similar pattern on each fish... check Same water chop in every picture... check Same background in at least 4 of the photos... check Same shadow in 5 of 6 pictures... check Last one is a big deal imo, it means the boat was in the same orientation, and the sun was in the same position for each photo. The two pictures showing time and battery power have the same LTE network, same signal strength, same notifications, and a 4% battery drain over 20 minutes... However I think you're weakening your case by pointing out distinctive features on the fish, to me the entire pattern of the fish looks the same."

Honestly makes me wonder a lot about tournament fishing in general. I actually fish a small derby every year and as weird as this is, theres one particular guy that fishes it solo every single year, he never is around at take off, and he puts the fish back in his livewell at the end of weigh in. He also has literally won every single derby that hes participated in....weve always had suspicion that something is up, and this just makes me feel really weird about the whole situation now. It really is, far too easy...and the fact that this guy has literally won 6? times in a row now..Id like to believe that hes a local from the lake and is just that good, but at the same time, doesnt someone have to have an off day at some point?
