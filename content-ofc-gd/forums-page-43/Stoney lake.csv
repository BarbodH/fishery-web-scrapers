1047368,Ralph Zettler,2019-07-22 20:55:00,10,Planning a trip to Stoney lake in Aug  with my son wondering if I could get some pointers Never fished this lake but heard good things thanks in advance
1047392,Garnet,2019-07-23 11:56:00,2056,If in boat be very very carefull. And the maps don't trust them.
1047398,Pigeontroller,2019-07-23 14:20:00,2793,"A good GPS and nav chip, used with a dose of caution is a must!"
1047410,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-23 19:48:00,8243,If you don't know Stoney or don't have the best E maps bring an extra prop. I have fished it many times up towards Burley Falls. There are plenty of Walleye there which we fished for. We would troll our go to spots to find the fish then drifting with a simple jig and minnow was our ticket to success. Get as vertical as possible. No exact depth day to day. Clear Lake off of Stoney is good too.
1047411,AKRISONER,2019-07-23 19:52:00,5558,"the only lake i have been on and witnessed 2 people within an hour of eachother absolutely smoke rocks at speed. One was a yacht that actually beached himself on a shoal and needed help getting pushed back off of it. Stick to the drive lines on your graph and if you want to venture off of them, throw in the trolling motor and take its slow. The water is very very clear due to the zebra muscles, but its also a navigation nightmare. If you dont have a graph...good luck"
1047413,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-23 20:01:00,8243,"I have a theory as far as navigating goes. If I didn't hit anything on the way out and I follow my track line to the T on the way back I won't hit anything coming back in, usually. Oh and I have never even gone 3/4 throttle on Stoney, that includes the old 9.9 with the tilt pin out."
1047414,AKRISONER,2019-07-23 20:07:00,5558,"ive tournament fished it 3 times now, and leisure fished it multiple times but never as the driver, and never in my boat. Im scared this year because its my turn to drive."
1047417,David Chong,2019-07-23 20:41:00,836,"Beautiful lake where rocks seem to grow overnight! LOL Today's Navionics charts are pretty good, although I have fished it hundreds of times I wouldn't go there without a Navionics chip in my unit! Smallmouth & Largemouth Bass fishing is pretty decent, lots of small Smallies! Walleye fishing is okay too but make sure that you'are aware of the slot! Good population of Muskies as well! Endless islands and rock points to fish, I like rock weed transitions where you can almost catch anything! Good luck!"
1047584,bigcreekdad,2019-07-25 20:22:00,546,"I fished Stoney for over 20 years starting in the late 60's. No avionics then, so we just had to be darn careful. Quit fishing it when it started to get way too busy. But, the fishing was very good."
1047622,DanD,2019-07-26 11:01:00,2223,A good friend of mine fished it once. After the lake ate his boat's prop and took a bite out of the skag; he swore to never return. LOL  So i guess the lake got its name for a reason?? Dan.
1047627,pidge,2019-07-26 13:17:00,438,"As others have posted, be VERY careful. I haven’t fished it in a few years, but use to do so on the regular. I never had any GPS device, but would creep when outside the channel markers. Once outside them it isn’t to hard in calm water to see why it’s called Stoney. Be careful and have fun!! -Pidge"
