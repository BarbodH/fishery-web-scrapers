Last time we went out (several hundred feet from shore off of Nicholson's Point) the fish finder picked up several fish down between 15ft - 40ft of water (and also what appeared to be possibly schools of bait fish, or random debris?). I'm wondering what type of fish are present to this area? And at depths up to 60 feet of water?  Has anyone here fished in Lake Ontario near Kingston? And if so, what have you typically caught out there?   "

Elevator Bay (Dupont / Invista) for carp, pan fish and at times, good pike. 1000 King St area behind buildings and townhouses for pike and bass. Portsmouth Harbor used to be good at the end of the long wharf area and along it for pike and bass. I've caught some great fish pretty much all around this area and in the latter summer / fall, walleye will come into harbor in the evening."

And what you found, arent they talking about directly fishing from the shore? I mean do panfish, pike, or carps really go down to 30+ feet of water several hundred feet from shore in Lake Ontario?"
