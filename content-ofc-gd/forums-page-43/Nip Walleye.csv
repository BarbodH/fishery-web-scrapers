1048062,kickingfrog,2019-08-05 14:20:00,8333,Heading up there next week with the family.
1048065,NAW,2019-08-05 14:53:00,4022,Nice Chad!
1048068,Moosebunk,2019-08-05 14:57:00,3970,Great eye for a generally small eye fishery!
1048070,Marty,2019-08-05 15:09:00,873,"Nice fish.  They keep bumping the minimums on Nip and the fish are getting bigger.  We had a fantastic time up there last week.  Multiple 40-50 fish days with plenty of keepers, all between 9:30 am - 3:30 pm.   We fished muskies before breakfast and after dinner.  Most walleyes were in the 15-18 inch range but we went home with our limit of keepers."
1048074,lew,2019-08-05 15:41:00,12766,How'd you make out with the muskies Marty ?
1048076,Marty,2019-08-05 16:02:00,873,Don't want to hijack this thread but I just posted a report from our trip.  How's it going Lew?
1048077,lew,2019-08-05 16:26:00,12766,"Doing great Bud, I'll check your post shortly."
1048094,BillM,2019-08-05 23:37:00,17367,"Nice man!  I was in Hartley Bay all of last week.   The walleyes were on fire.  40-50 fish days were easy, although getting something bigger then the 23.6in slot was tough.   All deep for the most part to, 25-50ft.   Couldn't crack that nut all week.   I got 2 blowups when fishing muskies and that's it for me.   Thinking of trying the West Arm the next time I get a week off."
