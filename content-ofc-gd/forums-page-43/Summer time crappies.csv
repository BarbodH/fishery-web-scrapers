1047477,KeithK,2019-07-24 15:41:00,5,"Hi All, I'm new to the Kawarthas on Pigeon Lake near Emily Provincial Park.  I was catching some nice tasty slab crappies during the spring time, but they all seem to have disappeared.  Anyone have any idea where I can find them on Pigeon Lake?  I only have a small aluminum boat with a 9.9 outboard, so can't go far.  I would appreciate any information on where and how to find them. Thanks, KeithK"
1047487,jimmer,2019-07-24 16:44:00,2730,They are more than likely suspended in the deeper water to the north.  It's rare to catch a crappie in the south end once the spawn is over. Most people don't target them in the summer because they are very tough to locate and catch. Just my opinion though.
1047490,AKRISONER,2019-07-24 18:32:00,5558,funny enough the only time i caught a crapola in the summer time on pigeon was on a topwater in the evening..i wouldnt necessarily call it a pattern lol
1047495,KawarthaAngler,2019-07-24 19:04:00,273,Yup.  So hard to find I never hear of anyone targeting them in the summer.  They certainly get caught by surprise.  I brought one into the boat that wasn't too bad 3 weeks ago on Chemong on a dropshot with a small artificial minnow in approx 8ft weed.
1047496,Reef Runner,2019-07-24 19:11:00,980,Harder to target in the summer as they disperse into heavier and deeper weeds.  In the summer my go-to crappie bait is a jointed rapala minnow J05 in either fire tiger or yellow perch pattern.  Slow retrieve over 5-8 foot weed in 10-14 fow.  Light action rod with a lot of give so you don't come up with nothing but lips on the hook set lol.
1047499,KeithK,2019-07-24 19:53:00,5,"Thanks to all the members for responding.  The reason for my inquiry was that I caught a nice slab last week on a wacky rig catching largemouth bass.  I thought maybe someone might know if they are still in the river but in deep weed.  As a quote on my tee shirts says ""A bad day of fishing is better than a good day of work"". Gone Fishing."
1047500,AKRISONER,2019-07-24 19:56:00,5558,"ive caught them in August on the kawarthas on a crankbait suspended off a deep rock break wall, but who knows whether thats a consistent thing either. I was fishing bass and ran into a school of crappies."
1047506,BillM,2019-07-24 21:54:00,17367,I've been laying the smack down on big slabs since the start of July.  I can't catch them in the spring for ****!   Weed edges in the 8-15ft range morning and early evening.  It's a gongshow one minute and the next it's over.    I've catch them in the exact same spots year after year.   Also bonus walleyes as well.    I find they much prefer edges compared to being deep in the thick stuff.   And they'll definitely suspend over open water as well.
1047548,KeithK,2019-07-25 13:14:00,5,"I was hoping to hear that Bill, are you able to share with us where on Pigeon Lake are you catching them slabs.  Any hints would be much appreciated.  Thanks!"
1047551,AKRISONER,2019-07-25 13:31:00,5558,"lol i guarantee thats a no, especially with fish that have a 30 fish limit."
1047556,KeithK,2019-07-25 14:58:00,5,"LOL!! Hey, it doesn't hurt to ask.  How many slabs do you need for a dinner?  30 fish limit is too high anyway.  I only want to keep 4-5, just enough for our family dinner."
1047562,BillM,2019-07-25 15:30:00,17367,"It's not pigeon, but if you find those weed edges I'm willing to bet you'll find the crappies.   Lunker City fin-S minnows are my fav on a 1/8oz head."
