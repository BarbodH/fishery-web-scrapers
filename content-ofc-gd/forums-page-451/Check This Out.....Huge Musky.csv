I for one would love to know what he has forgot.  Paul"
132437,Roy,2007-11-11 15:02:00,13728,Great post Larry. Thanks for taking the time. It seems as though some people (very very few) are one with the fish and their surroundings. Mike Lazarus is certainly one of those people.
132440,Dano,2007-11-11 15:07:00,719, You've been here a year?
132493,PAZE,2007-11-11 18:04:00,132,"Oh Ive been here alot longer then a year. Ive been through three or four board changes, just because I dont post don't mean that I have not been around. Do I need 1800 post to be recognized.???  Paul"
132501,stuntman,2007-11-11 18:34:00,96,I don't buy it.....there is no way that guy is from Quebec.  Its for sure that the toque and red snowmobile suit are photoshopped in.  On the other hand that fish looks pretty authentic.
132504,Dano,2007-11-11 19:24:00,719, Apparently....
132598,ehg,2007-11-12 00:39:00,2666,"I remember Mike Lazurus got a huge fish with Ed Barbosa a few years ago in the late fall, next to O'Breins it was the hugest musky i've seen. Tried to post picture a few times in last few years but not allowed to do so.  That guy must be good.   ehg"
132674,snag,2007-11-12 03:41:00,1932," O.k. I don't know Dano but he caught my interest.  I trust Mr.Lazurus is a legend.  From the pathetic fish I've caught that are dwarfed by his mastery, I am curious about why there aren't those fatty indentations where he's holding them?  I guess I expected to see a bit of fat around the fingers at the front and bottom.  Just wonderin'"
132800,ehg,2007-11-12 15:12:00,2666,This is one of the largest muskies i've seen. Probably C&R record musky. Mike Lazarus and Ed Barbosa (in red).  Don't think photoshoping is a tool for this guy.  
132804,Guest gbfisher,2007-11-12 15:40:00,0,I'm not so sure. Obrien at 5.8 and two guys holding a brute that DWARFS it.....  I would think ....ah never mind what I think lol........   THATS A GREAT BIGGUN....WTG LAZ.....
132818,Moosebunk,2007-11-12 16:39:00,3970," Did TM fit the bill for high profile???  If so, did he agree with the others or tell ya the best is he?"
132979,muskymatt,2007-11-13 00:30:00,2608," Absolutley fits the bill Bunk.  And he holds ML in the highest regards.  And a few other honorable mentions as well....(he may not get along with them all but acknowledges their ability)  Personally ....all the ego crap and slinging aside I regard TM as .........up there.  A great family man, good businessman, honest person and good friend.  Matt"
132992,addict,2007-11-13 00:53:00,475,that guy stole my fish from my live well
133017,gozwob,2007-11-13 01:36:00,34,....beauty 'ski!........'nuff said.
133151,ehg,2007-11-13 16:33:00,2666,The 49 lb musky above looks tiger musky-esque. Unbelievable fish.   ehg
656463,thepositer,2012-01-14 02:02:00,3,Fantastic fisherman and also known for using multiple lines per angler.
656468,Pigeontroller,2012-01-14 02:22:00,2793,"And just like that, the picture is gone...The Legend continues..."
656470,Terry,2012-01-14 02:28:00,14456,well the thread is from 2007  people do clean up their photoalbums
656471,irishfield,2012-01-14 02:31:00,26272, I was just surprised that a newbie dug up a 4 year + old post to take a shot at a Musky charter guy!  ..well maybe not that surprised.. but..
656480,muskymike,2012-01-14 03:46:00,772,"What is that smell??  Its funny though, you look back at some of the names that posted in this thread...its a shame that a lot of these guys are not around anymore. I know Paze still lurks in the darkness...Paul, if you read this, shoot me a PM."
656493,Pigeontroller,2012-01-14 04:52:00,2793,I hate it when that happens...I usually notice the date...
656495,Muskieman,2012-01-14 05:09:00,2472,Is this the picture?  
656512,Roy,2012-01-14 13:41:00,13728, Wow! Burned your supper last night did you? You've been here three months and already a keyboard hero. You obviously don't know Mike Lazarus. We'll be watching your posts from here on in. It shouldn't be too difficult.
656582,craigdritchie,2012-01-14 20:10:00,1586,"Mike Lazarus has been pretty highly respected in the muskie community for at least 20 - 25 years. He doesn't need Photoshop to make his fish look big, nor does he need to prove anything to anyone. The guy knows how to catch big muskie, and he's very, very good at it."
656585,BillM,2012-01-14 20:20:00,17367,I can't believe guys call out someone like Mike Lazarus.....    Sounds like nothing but jealousy to me.
131811,Basskicker,2007-11-09 13:23:00,421,"I found this on another board......Anybody hear about this guy.....Mike Lazurus?  Quoted  Thats is the greatest musky fisherman alive, thers not even a close second, you'll be lucky to ever see an other picture buy this guy on the internet. He never exposes pictures unless your in his boat, and getting in his boat is almost imposible. I was shocked to see this one on the other site.  i've only heard about him, but i've heard the same thing...he doesn't need to PIMP himself on the internet.... He has american clients who book him up years in advance.... If there is an angler who has a legend and respect among the hardcore anglers, its Lazurus.   What I know of Laz is that he has something like 12-14 main clients a year, they fish the same weeks that they book year after year, if you cant make it, theres an opening and he'll call you for that fill in, but theres a catch.....theres piles of guys in line waiting to get out with him so the odds of you getting out are very,very slim. The last I heard he was charging $600 a day, but worth every single penny, If you ever see a picture with Ed Barbosa in it holding cows and a grey/blue ranger, there with Laz almost 95% of the time. It does not matter where he fishes G-bay, the Ottawa, The Larry he puts you on fish all the time, if anybody has figurd out the musky secret its Laz. The ones who know him know what Im talking about, hes a machine, I would love to see this guy write a book.  just for an info.he has 386 musky last year.... and more then 5000musky under is belt... some numbers.wow..but he wont brag about the numbers here. and dont think you will fish wit him.if my source are good..no locals people only american....about local people gething is spot and so on...smart move. suposely just the best in the world. for musky. there is a great article on him in sentier chasse et peche...i think it was oct 2007...the nu bers are in there..386...mabe even more if my mind is playing..    That's a monster.....how much do you figure it weighs?   40-50lbs maybe???  Jason"
131814,Guest gbfisher,2007-11-09 13:25:00,0,He and Thorpe fish the same areas..............I think  HOG for sure
131815,fishindevil,2007-11-09 13:30:00,6254,"WOW...Thats a huge musky !!!!!   And if thats all true numbers,thats just incredible !!!!!! ....and you say nobody has ever heard of him before,i sure havnt...well good for him,and maybe he will get the next world -record musky..  .thanks for sharing that about him,....cheers"
131818,SlowPoke,2007-11-09 13:37:00,2984,"I think this is the guy that is so good... he collects his guiding fees, leaves his clients on the dock, fishes all day and then tells them the stories when he gets back."
131819,mattyk,2007-11-09 13:39:00,2110,thats one huge musky!
131820,Roy,2007-11-09 13:41:00,13728,Mike Lazarus is very well known in the muskie world. He is very good at what he dose.
131821,irishfield,2007-11-09 13:46:00,26272,  HAHAHA.. you've seen that too aye Brian ! LOL  Never met him..just heard the stories.
131822,Jigger,2007-11-09 13:47:00,1237,Too bad the guy in the pic doesn't have any taste in headgear. Awesome fish!!!
131824,Terry,2007-11-09 13:54:00,14456,if a tree falls in the forest and there is no one around to post pictures on the internet does it still make a sound
131825,JohnF,2007-11-09 13:54:00,3494, That toque probably used to be blue or black. The sun has burned it. I can't explain the silly looking logo though.  JF
131978,PAZE,2007-11-09 22:06:00,132,"  I take it you have never heard of him? trust me he leaves know one on the dock, and theres no fish stories coming from Laz. The numbers are off, there much higher from what I recall, his yearly catchers are out of this world. Like the quote says ""Theres not even a close second"".  Paul"
132001,SlowPoke,2007-11-09 22:58:00,2984, It's an inside joke...you had to be there.
132002,PAZE,2007-11-09 23:06:00,132,"Kind of glad I wasnt, mabe I would have been left on the dock LOL"
132010,SlowPoke,2007-11-09 23:32:00,2984, LOL! Good one!
132019,silveradosheriff,2007-11-10 00:03:00,1025,"Lovely fish! The one thing I know for sure is that Marc Thorpe does an awesome job of handling and releasing his Musky. Maybe, we should team up Cronzy with him?  "
132026,solopaddler,2007-11-10 00:16:00,8605,The man is a legend...
132028,Crazyhook,2007-11-10 00:26:00,1154,that fish went 49 pounds.... a real beauty!  the Hat... not a beauty
132037,muskymatt,2007-11-10 01:16:00,2608,Although I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mike Laz. I have however polled every high profile muskie guide and highly experienced angler I could.  The question was ....Who is the best Muskie guide...period   And every single one answered Mike L.   I have searched high and low for info on him ...but it seems he just likes to quietly go about catching fish for clients the likes of which is shown above.
132068,BillM,2007-11-10 02:38:00,17367,What I would do to spend a day fishing with someone that had some good experience with muskie.   For some reason it's always been 'the fish' with me.  That thing is a monster.
132135,Dano,2007-11-10 11:02:00,719,"I dont know, somehow that pic just doesnt look right. Look at his hands on the fish, he doesnt even have it by the jaw and the right hand seems to hardly dent the fish where he is supporting it. I dont buy it."
132223,PAZE,2007-11-10 20:25:00,132," Yup that is the post of the year right there LOL, you have got to be kidding me.  Paul"
132247,SlowPoke,2007-11-10 22:47:00,2984,"I was skeptical about the photo too... looks like a photoshop job. I mean really, who would allow themselves to caught on film with a habs hat. The fish looks legit. -Brian"
132336,Musky or Specks,2007-11-11 05:18:00,2710,I was lucky enough to attend a Musky Fishing Seminar by Mike. The guy really knows his stuff. I feeel very privledge because I understand he doesn't do them to much anymore. We had him speak at our KW MCI club meeting and there was guys there from the states and Quebec just to hear him talk.
132391,Greencoachdog,2007-11-11 12:22:00,8163,Fat Fish!!!
132406,Larry Ramsell,2007-11-11 13:13:00,5,"I am one of those fortunate few that get to fish with ""That Lazarus Man"". I have been in the muskie game for over 50 years and in my opinion, he is the best muskie fisherman that has ever set foot on this planet! Don't get me wrong. There are many who are ""very good"" in this muskie game, but Laz is the ""Dean"".  The posted photo (surprised me it got out) is truly a giant 49-pounder that most would kill for. While not real common even for Laz, that is far from many of his larger ones. His stats would blow the mind of even the most seasoned of muskie hunters and I won't detail them here. I did dedicate 4 pages in Volume II of my revised 3rd Edition book ""A Compendium of Muskie Angling History"" to him (with his hesitant permission) that ""touch's"" on his accomplishments in the muskie game.  A truly amazing gentleman who hasn't left me on the dock...yet! I consider it a privilege to occupy a space in his boat. As for his choice of hats, it only accentuates his ""hate"" of the miserable beasts...LOL  Muskie regards, Larry Ramsell www.larryramsell.com"
