Failed to start when I needed it last winter.'Took it to Hyundai repair centre, they finally got it started. Crappy carb system, very difficult to start. Later starter rope broke. I lost WalMart receipt so no warranty coverage. I had to mod air breather with tube to spray ether into carbs to start. Honda & Yamaha aren't cheap but definitely worth the premium when you need power."
