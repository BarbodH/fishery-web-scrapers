656817,fishdawg,2012-01-15 18:00:00,912,   no  I dont think so
656820,danbouck,2012-01-15 18:02:00,4380,I burst out laughing when I saw the title. There may be no fishing at all this winter on LPB
656822,kickingfrog,2012-01-15 18:11:00,8333, How about from a boat?
656827,tb4me,2012-01-15 18:30:00,3295,thats brutal..oh well wishfull thinking I supose....Im glad I was good for a laugh there Dan...
656872,BillM,2012-01-15 21:23:00,17367,"Zero ice anywhere, was down at 9th line this morning, what a joke.   We won't be out until Feb if we are lucky."
656893,danbouck,2012-01-15 22:46:00,4380," There is ice on Puslinch lake an little lake,  people are out on it ice fishing"
656919,BillM,2012-01-15 23:31:00,17367," Dan, I thought the OP was asking about Simcoe, lol!  Yeah there's other ice up here to fish..  But I got the itch for lakers and whities!"
656922,danbouck,2012-01-15 23:39:00,4380,It was for Long Point Bay and I mean Little Lake beside Puslinch lake
656927,BillM,2012-01-15 23:45:00,17367, I figured that out after you replied   I might have a case of winter fever.
656931,ketchenany,2012-01-15 23:52:00,3229," Pour ""something"" over ice cubes and YOU will be cured! If you fall what you'll hit all be warm and dry!"
656933,BillM,2012-01-15 23:56:00,17367,"I've got some Gibsons Finest Rare 18 year on top of the fridge, that might just be the cure"
656935,ketchenany,2012-01-16 00:14:00,3229," I never touch the ""hard stuff"" but I do collect it. My oldest is a 64 Crown Royal and a Kings Ransom that was 12 years old when my daughter was born and that was in 77. Now that's warm.  Be careful out there, I was the same, not worth your life. Memories of ninth line."
