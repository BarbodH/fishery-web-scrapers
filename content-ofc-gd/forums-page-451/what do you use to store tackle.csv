655590,skinny,2012-01-11 15:14:00,442,Ok so I have mainly a plano softside with 43 or 4 trays in it. then I have a soft bait bag and a specialmates box of lures. I recently bought a bunch of lures from an ad on Kijji and have put them into the mates box. but to do so ment I had to remove the spinnerbaits and buzzbaits I had in it (they didn't fit well). so right now I have a pile of spinner and buzz baits all over my bench. I need to figure out a simple way to house them as I already have my hands full loading up all I have now. so looking for ideas I used the little plastic boxes for a bit but found them to be a pain to carry around too
655598,bigmac1984,2012-01-11 15:30:00,193,I have used boxes like this before and they worked well:  http://www.basspro.com/Plano-FTO-Elite-FTO360-Series-Utility-Box-Spinnerbait/product/10210353/56532 http://www.basspro.com/Plano-FTO-Elite-FTO370-Series-Utility-Box-Spin/Buzzbait/product/10210361/121993
655600,bassjnkie,2012-01-11 15:42:00,1101,"I have the Falcon buzz/spinnerbait boxes. Plano FTO boxes are exactly the same. The boxes have separate spaces that lock in the bait and arm, no tangles, no mess. Worth the money."
655641,mercman,2012-01-11 18:15:00,7054,I use the paper cd covers with the plastic window.Easy to store and you can see whats in them.  
655663,manitoubass2,2012-01-11 19:31:00,11391," I do the same, and mine are right in a cd holder from wal-mart I got for like $4. Zipper it up, it's compact, light and very convenient  downside, it doesnt hold more that about 12 spinner baits    "
655666,mercman,2012-01-11 19:35:00,7054,Great minds think alike
655670,lew,2012-01-11 19:48:00,12766,Storage becomes somewhat more of a problem when the baits are larger than bass sized lures.  I use Tupperware type boxes and just lay the baits on top of each other and sort them out as needed. I normally only carry what I need so the tangles aren't usually too bad.  
655673,skinny,2012-01-11 19:52:00,442,really I think I should get better at trying to decide what I'm going to use before going out. at this point I usally take it all incase I want something
655675,kickingfrog,2012-01-11 19:57:00,8333, That's 11 more then any reasonable person could possibly need?
655701,smally21,2012-01-11 21:03:00,993,"i was thinking the same, sometimes the best tackle storage ideas start with reducing the quantities we carry.... i like the cde case idea, well done. i have a plastic tub that supports them all upright, fits about a dozen (guilty)"
655713,manitoubass2,2012-01-11 21:35:00,11391,"  I do own a dozen, but I only use three, lol. Haven't bought a spinnerbait in years either, and won't until I need to replace one of those three"

655741,MCTFisher9120,2012-01-11 23:11:00,3761,I'm just using a Shimano Worm binder made for plastics...I pack the pairs and triples of same color/size in the ziplock bags it came with...seems to work better than the bulky traditional spinnerbait containers.
655826,Twocoda,2012-01-12 02:39:00,4130,i normally store all my tackle on the bottom of the river but every so often ...i do manage to bring one or two lures home and they generally end up in the truck glove box....
655891,Djeep,2012-01-12 13:09:00,199,I've went through 3 spinnerbaits in an outing just from smallies crushing them and ripping blades off so I started using terminators and then muskies started stealin them.. so I always carry close to 10 spinnerbaits haha I use a small spinner box for storage at home and a cd case on the go
655941,msp,2012-01-12 16:36:00,1336,I just use regular plano tackle trays. I use a sharp sturdy knife to cut small notches in the upright plastic on a couple of compartments and lay the spinnerbaits in with the blades in one compartment and the skirt and hook in the other. The wire sits nice in the notch.
655958,adempsey,2012-01-12 17:37:00,1498,"I purchased some Plano 3503 Spinnerbait boxes for my spinnerbaits and buzzbaits:    Never liked them much since they were too large IMO and didn't fit well with my other storage boxes.  I switched over to a Falcon FTO spinnerbait wallet, it's much more compact:    Those Plano FTO boxes look good too.  Looks like Plano bought Falcon."
