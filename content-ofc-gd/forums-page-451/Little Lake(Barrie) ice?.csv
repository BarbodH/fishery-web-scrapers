650805,Sebastian,2011-12-24 21:55:00,208,Any ice on the lake? Should be frozen over at least. Hopefully these cold temps stay even through long range forecast does not look too promising.
650807,misfish,2011-12-24 21:59:00,29133,"  If there is,I,ll be on it. I got the itch real bad."
650822,Fisherman,2011-12-24 22:55:00,7201,"It's covered, but not thick enough.  Somebody else was down there for a look today."
651023,fisherman7,2011-12-26 14:03:00,325,"I drive by it every day. It's got ice, but just. Going to warm up in Barrie so won't be safe for some time."
651035,Fisherman,2011-12-26 16:06:00,7201,"Ya, took an other peek this morning, doesn't look good yet.  Looks more like end of the season crumbly sugar ice with water patches on top.  It's pretty bad when this place doesn't have anyone out there fishing by Boxing day."
651069,J-M,2011-12-26 21:56:00,65," Yeah, little lake is usually loaded with fishermen at this time itching to get out on some ice! We had our hut on about 6"" or more by this time last year on Little Lake. The 14 day looks a bit depressing still..."
651070,misfish,2011-12-26 22:09:00,29133,"Had to pick up the son and grandaughter today.They live close to the lake. OPEN water was seen. Glad I have to work,this week."
651339,Sebastian,2011-12-28 11:36:00,208,Still nothing? We've had some cold nights. Planning to get out somewhere by friday. I have the itch!
651348,misfish,2011-12-28 12:19:00,29133,"  It wont be this week,thats for sure.This heavy snow and wind will make sure of that."
651350,Live2fish85,2011-12-28 12:31:00,1633,In a sense I am happy that the ice isn't forming yet around this area. If it were  the reports would make me go nuts as I can't get out.
652825,johnnyb,2012-01-03 03:46:00,3413,"I was on Little Lake last week....Dec. 29th.  Walked out from Duckworth popping holes as I went....small group of guys pulled up as I was heading out....they joined me....we were definitely the first ones to go out based on any tracks. Must have encouraged someone to get a bit crazy because a snowmobile took a quick zip out from the trailer park....never went far though and headed back in. After all that rain, then snow....I've no clue what it's currently like"
652965,davey buoy,2012-01-03 21:14:00,5505,"Swung by this afternoon,saw a couple of huts out,it may be finally time:clapping:"
652972,misfish,2012-01-03 21:20:00,29133,Thanks Davey.  That will scratch my itch for now.
656356,BucktownAngler,2012-01-13 19:20:00,582,anyone been lately? hows the ice/fishing?
656448,Rizzo,2012-01-14 01:22:00,4754,"I haven't seen the lake in a week or 2, but I did go past the marina in Barrie today and it no longer looked safe, a good portion of the marina had opened up. Super cold the next couple of days should really help"
656475,J-M,2012-01-14 03:20:00,65, Things should  lock up after this weekend and hopefully it stays that way....
656522,Rizzo,2012-01-14 14:28:00,4754," I think you're right. Its really cold for the next day or 2, get a bit above zero for a day or 2, then back to really cold again by Wednesday. I bet even Kemp. Bay freezes over the next day or 2 unless the wind is really howling"
656532,BillM,2012-01-14 15:18:00,17367,We aren't going to be fishing for whities on Simcoe until Feb.
656614,misfish,2012-01-14 23:35:00,29133,"I will say yes,it is safe now. We were out there last weekend and the ice was 4-5 inches. I was surprised (with the weather we been having). The bite is hot from dark til sun up. After that,grab a cold one and chat with each other. The lake is not like it use to be.   Bill,I,ll be on the riv around nineish. Give the sun time to hit my shore, to keep me warm.LOL  Grips,I didnt get a fish til after 11,so whats the rush."
