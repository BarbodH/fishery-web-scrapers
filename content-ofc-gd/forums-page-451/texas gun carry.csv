Since you made it back to Ontario alive? You didn`t get the full tour. One of the reasons I live 35 miles away and rarely go there, I lived there until my 23 birthday, that was enough fun for me."

Do you think those gangbangers would have cared at all?  Not a chance!   Who's a non supporter of guns?  I've got half a dozen shotguns downstairs...  I'm an avid hunter... Does that mean I need to agree with something like concealed carry in Ontario?    And that's my point... Why does anyone think that if Ontario had a conceal carry law that wouldn't have happened.."

Sure, it's no where near a sure thing that things would have turned out differently but there is a far better chance with one or more of the good guys armed than without.  The most important thing is being well practiced and proficient with your firearm. If you aren't you're no better than the bullet spraying banger."

Annually we have a company sponsored ""Men's Day"" outing, and we have shooting contests of every conceivable nature, from black powder to clays to hand guns and archery. Points are scored and tabulated in every category and then an overall Top Gun is crowned. After the morning shoot we eat, have drinks, play horsehoes and a variety of other contests. There is always a lot of fire power on hand, and everyone enjoys a great day on the range. the gals do something too, that seems to vary from year to year. Anyhow, we also have this very strict policy in our HR handbook, and it reads, ""in order to bring a firearm to work you must have your supervisor's approval"".   It is quite frequent that someone will bring in a unique firearm for everyone to see and admire. Maybe it's just a coincidence but we have zero gun crime i our town of 15,000."

I could not believe the types of weapons or the numbers that I saw openly carried and displayed. People were walking the isles carrying rifles and hand guns. I guess they were looking to sell, trade, whatever? Just something I'm not accustomed to seeing.

While being in one of the first classes we learned the Texas State Laws governerning the use of deadly force and illegal weapons.  Some of the funny ones are listed below;  These are some funny haha, funny strange State Laws on the books in Texas concerning the use of deadly force and illegal weapons….  1.  You can use deadly force for malicious mischief at time of night - but not during the day.  A Ft. Worth Police Office and his son ambushed a group of teens in their front yard that were vandalizing their home over the past couple of days.  The ambush was staged from the roof of their home shooting the teens while they were in their front yard after they had damaged the garage door.  No changes were filed by the Ft. Worth Police Dept or the D.A….  Civil case pending, I bet….  2.  You can shoot through your home door and kill someone for banging on it and threating you at time of night, but not during the day….  Darn, this would certainly keep them thar sales people away, now wouldn't it….  3.  You can not use deadly for to prevent someone from committing suicide.  Well Dah, that's what he/she would be shooting for isn't it?  Can't even wound him/her just a little bit, go figure….  4.  If someone comes up to you and says ""give me your money"" you can use deadly force.  But if he says he's going to kill you - you can't until he tries to.  When a person says ""give me your money"" he is in the commission of a crime….  Hells Bells - If someone threatens to kill me I guess I will just toss him my wallet and then shoot him….  Solves that problem….  5.  When is a stick a stick and not an illegal club?  Easy, a stick is a stick as long as you don't fashiona handle with tape or attach a landyard to it.  Unless of course you just happen to have an axe handle in your truck or a baseball bat designed for a specific use….  Well, that clears that up now doesn't it?  I'll be carrying a baseball bat in my truck and my PPK - da hell with that stick….  "

Permissive open carry states  A state has passed full preemption of all firearms laws. They permit open carry to all non-prohibited citizens without permit or license. Open carry is lawful on foot and in a motor vehicle. Shown on the map to the right as ""Gold Star"" states; the term carries a pro-gun bias, as gun-control advocacy groups like the Brady Center generally give these states very low ""scores"" on their own ratings systems.  Licensed open carry states  A state has passed full preemption of all firearms laws. They permit open carry of a handgun to all non-prohibited citizens once they have been issued a permit or license. Open carry of a handgun is lawful on foot and in a motor vehicle.  Anomalous open carry states  In these states, open carry of a handgun is generally lawful, but the state may lack preemption or there may be other significant restrictions. Shown in the map legend as ""Open Carry Friendly"" states; the term is questionable as the limitations and/or lack of pre-emption means that certain of these states are, in their judicial system and law enforcement societies, not very ""friendly"" towards the practice.  Non-permissive open carry states  In these states, open carry of a handgun is not lawful, or is only lawful under such a limited set of circumstances that public carry is prohibited. Such limited circumstances may include when hunting, or while traveling to/from hunting locations, while on property controlled by the person carrying, or for lawful self-defense  When we would travel to the states for competitions there were a few dual citizenship guys that would open up the lock boxes and strap on their pistols right after we got out of customs, the rest of us Canucks left them politely in the triple locked box til the range...."
655900,doubleheader,2012-01-12 14:08:00,497,"  There are a lot of states that reciprocate, allowing individuals with conceal carry permits to travel between these reciprocating states unemcumbered; NYS is not one. That said, even in states with reciprocating agreements and a the castle doctrine, those castle doctrine laws vary greatly. There has been a very big spike in individuals in the US securing conceal carry permits, and interestingly enough a very large decline most recently in the murder rate, which in the interest of objective discussion has been on a general decline for years. Most people that carry do so concealed. I have a pocket 9MM that i carry, a little smaller caliber than I'd prefer, but it makes for lightweight packing."

I am not a supporter of O. C. It leads to trouble in most cases. I got my CCP due to the local differences in the laws. The NRA sponsored CCP program give you lots of O. C.

You shouldn't carry open firearms in these states just to avoid a charge of bringing terror to the people which only requires a citizen to see you carry open firearms and saying they are in fear. You will get charged."

655982,Billy Bob,2012-01-12 19:09:00,5865,"About 2 years ago our local TV news had a story that a man was walking down the street with a shotgun or rifle and police picked him up after someone called them....they never followed up on the story....problem was they probably couldn't as no laws were broken....yes, it is against the law to discharge a firearm in many villages and even some towns here...but possession of a firearm (long gun) is not a crime.....but don't have a loaded long gun in a vehicle or even leaning up against a vehicle while hunting...that's a no no that's going to cost you dearly."
655983,Billy Bob,2012-01-12 19:11:00,5865, ALL firearm purchasers must have a instant background check before the firearm can be sold.

655985,smally21,2012-01-12 19:29:00,993,its likely a bad idea to correct a guy carrying a gun.....we'll just go with whatever you say.
656004,blaque,2012-01-12 20:43:00,2419,"I remember a few years back at Oak Orchard while fishing alone at the bend, hearing rocks crunching behind me. I turned figuring another fisherman has arrived (it was like 15 degrees in the middle of winter so at that point i was the only dummy out on the water lol)  So when i turn around its some guy walking with some sort of long barrel gun resting up against his shoulder. Me, not being familiar with gun laws or hunting seasons, i was a bit startled to see a guy down there with a gun. Regardless, even if there were some sort of bird season, im pretty sure ya just cant go down to the water to hunt in that location.  He ended up walking past to the end of the island downstream and i heard him crunching around in the reeds. I eventually moved upstream and had my head on a swivel all morning wondering what this dude was all about. Never did find out.  All i know is it made me uneasy knowing somebody was prowling around the area i was fishing with heat lol"

656025,Billy Bob,2012-01-12 21:33:00,5865,"This September I was untying my boat at Erie Basin Marina launch to do  some late season walleye fishing....just starting to get a bit light when all hell broke out...bang bang bang bang and so forth....the security guard came running over to me asking me where the shots are coming from...(now for those not familiar with Erie Basin Marina, it's in downtown Buffalo). The last time this many shots where heard in downtown Buffalo 4 were killed at the City Grill after a wedding....but this time I knew all the shots came from the lake.....after we launched we putted out of the harbor only to hear and this time see these yahoo's banging away at Canada Geese from inside the outer harbor....that's city limits even by the longest Redneck's imagination....those are the guys that give real hunters a bad name..."
656026,OhioFisherman,2012-01-12 21:35:00,6623,"I bought a semi automatic pistol, 3 magazines, and 350 rounds of ammo a couple of months ago. It took about 15 minutes in the sporting goods store, background check and some paper work and I was out the door.  The US had record gun sales over the Christmas holidays. I can legally shoot any legal weapon in my back yard."
