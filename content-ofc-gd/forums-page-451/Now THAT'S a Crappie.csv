656393,Dan668,2012-01-13 21:38:00,1120,"Still a nice fish either way, my dad caught a 15"" crappie in the kawarthas last year. Thing was huge for a panfish. Have to dig through my pics and find it."
656394,Roy,2012-01-13 21:40:00,13728,"Agreed, Art. But sometimes you just consider the source."
656395,jedimaster,2012-01-13 21:40:00,3472,"Its the old adage, post a pic or post the size but don't do both. Unless its scale worthy. Especially if your giving the Monster Fish Stretch hold. I don't think anyone said its not a good or a great crappie, but to post a size beside that is just crazy. I would expect the same bask a roo if I did that."
656397,Roy,2012-01-13 21:42:00,13728, Looking forward to seeing it Danbob....measuring my fingers as we speak.
656402,aplumma,2012-01-13 21:48:00,6896, It was just a quick rant   :D    I'm better now.    Art
656405,lew,2012-01-13 21:50:00,12766, About 3 years between my last 2 fishing reports Art.
656406,jedimaster,2012-01-13 21:52:00,3472,"Lew, I liked your last one with all them big muskies."
656436,Billy Bob,2012-01-14 00:18:00,5865,I don't believe Nipfisher the OP said that this is his fish but rather he see this pic somewhere and posted it...
656544,OutdoorDan,2012-01-14 16:35:00,325,"   I think if it was a member's report people would be a lot more lenient.  But some degree of criticism is still needed when it comes to huge exaggeration, because people need to be held accountable for lying.  People not posting reports is probably because everyone is becoming more and more secretive of their spots and also because they feel like members (and even more so unregistered lurkers) who contribute nothing shouldn't benefit from free information.  It's definitely not because of negative feedback - if you go and look through all the recent posted reports every one of them has many replies thanking the OP and congratulating him for a nice outing.

656865,northernpike56,2012-01-15 20:53:00,717,dude thats HUGE!!!!
656878,JoshS,2012-01-15 21:31:00,729,Nice sized crappies!
656960,Rattletrap2,2012-01-16 01:48:00,1652," Yes, Dr. Bruce Condello is a Dental Surgeon from Nebraska that is very well known and respected for raising huge strains of Bluegills. He catches tons of em (and evidently, huge Crappie as well!) and this fish most likely came from a private lake or pond. He has the opportunity to fish some very exclusive waters."
655434,Nipfisher,2012-01-11 00:10:00,2449,"  Larger picture    Off of FB.  18""  3 pounds!"
655437,Leecher,2012-01-11 00:17:00,7832,"18"" Crappie    WOW man... simply WOW"
655440,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-11 00:26:00,2690,"Holy crappie.  He's definitely mastered the hold them out and make them look gigantic hold, but, that is a really nice fish."
655458,crappieperchhunter,2012-01-11 00:58:00,2582,Could be 18...looks more like 15-16 to me. Nice fish none the less.
655460,BillM,2012-01-11 01:01:00,17367,Atlantic.
655466,NAW,2012-01-11 02:01:00,4022,Yikes..  Nice fish.  Hopefully I'll get a few half that size this weekend
655468,Nipfisher,2012-01-11 02:05:00,2449,"  I followed the link to his FB page and he holds all his fish ""out"" for the camera. Still a big fish. The angler lives in Nebraska."
655474,Rizzo,2012-01-11 02:31:00,4754,that is a nice fish but the hold is a bit silly
655491,MJL,2012-01-11 02:53:00,2427,Nice hands...They're huge!  Here’s a fact for the guys that straight arm fish towards the camera: Big fish don’t need help looking big...They are big
655494,OutdoorDan,2012-01-11 02:59:00,325,"His fingers would need to be about 1.5"" wide for that fish to be 18"".  It's a nice fish no doubt, but it's not 18""."
655509,mike rousseau,2012-01-11 03:55:00,4661, Lol
655596,Stoty,2012-01-11 15:28:00,2910,"Wow, that's a tank! My buddy and I got one out of Scugog last year that was 16"" and 2.1 lbs. That thing makes our's look like bait! The 18"" and 3 lbs is a pretty accurate guess I'd say."
655609,Billy Bob,2012-01-11 16:28:00,5865,"I have to wonder how long are his arms....  It's a shame that some do this but I have seen it MANY times here before.  Really takes away from how big the actual fish is....like MJL said, big fish need any help looking big. But it's still a very nice looking specimen.  My old fishing buddy's father always said....""All Fishermen are LIARS, except You and Me...and I have my doubts about YOU..."
655624,Roy,2012-01-11 17:24:00,13728,"There's nothing at all wrong with the hold on that fish. It's a fish picture folks, meant to highlight a great looking fish.....not the angler nor the surroundings. Heck I don't even see a shiny expensive reel in there, not even a sponsor's logo or decal. It's perfect. But, in keeping with the general path of this thread I could say that I don't like his shirt much.  Thanks for posting this great catch."
655631,Billy Bob,2012-01-11 17:54:00,5865," Roy, that makes you sound JEALOUS (of his shirt)...."
655632,BillM,2012-01-11 17:58:00,17367,You could make that fish look like 30lbs if you actually used a UWA lens wide open.  Nothing wrong with that pic.
655651,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-01-11 18:58:00,535,"Nice crappie. Every spring and fall a guy from work and myself rent some cottages with a bunch of guys and have a bit of a tournament. Fall of 2010 was just a slow, slow weekend though. The 2nd largest fish caught was a 15.5"" crappie, biggest I've seen personally. Funny cause there's rarely any crappie caught there."
655739,Jer,2012-01-11 22:51:00,1426,I think this one's bigger...  
655773,aplumma,2012-01-12 00:48:00,6896, The only reason the fish looks big is because you chopped off the guys legs and painted the hut grey.  :wallbash:    (nice fish)   Art
655805,wormdunker,2012-01-12 01:54:00,1711,"Come on guys/girls,  that is a nice crappie!  Give credit where credit is due."
655898,Nipfisher,2012-01-12 13:39:00,2449,Here are some monster crappie with measurements.  Huge Slabs
656154,Abberz,2012-01-13 02:12:00,140, Ive got to agree with Jer on this one.  I have many pictures of crappie in the 14-16 inch range that weighed 1.5-2.0 lbs that look bigger than this 3lber in question.
656366,jedimaster,2012-01-13 20:07:00,3472,Here is your evidence of this NOT being 18 inches...  
656380,OutdoorDan,2012-01-13 20:56:00,325,"Yep, and the eye of the fish would have to be well over an inch in diameter for it to be even close to that big."
656391,aplumma,2012-01-13 21:34:00,6896,"I just don't understand why people don't post their fishing reports anymore????  :wallbash:  If you see a nice fish say ""nice fish"" if you don't agree on the size do what you normally do in a face to face situation say "" nice fish"". Why we all have to hack and cut at people who stretch the size or weight on a fish on the internet has cost us to miss out on a lot of wonderful trips thru someone else's eyes. The time and effort to post a report is rewarded with this crap is why you see so few of the fishing adventures I have down here.   Art"
