It is actually more dangerous now because there is a skim of thin ice over these areas so you cannot see where they are.  This is not intended to scare anyone away, I have been on the ice since opening day and the ice is thick in most places.  If you don't know the lake follow someones path.  I know the lake well, but I won't travel at night this year as there are just too many bad spots, and it is very easy to get disoriented when it is dark."

656891,GBW,2012-01-15 22:46:00,8460,"all I can add is USE CAUTION!  I was out on the lake yesterday and it's far from good ice where I was with Sinclair.  Slick and not thick for the most part (the ice you dirty old minds out there and you know who you are ).  I had to keep my spikes on my boots all day so I wouldn't slide away in the wind...  *edit* I need a new keyboard, this one is junk"
