656362,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-13 19:57:00,10439,This weekend we are going to see our first stretch of Arctic winter weater. Hopefully some of it will blow your way so y'all can hit the ice. By next weekend they are calling for highs in the -40's. I'm going into hibernation on Sunday and will emerge when the temps are more favourable and the chance of damaging equipment lessens. Until then I have a couple of rods that need building.  
656363,Fish4Eyes,2012-01-13 20:02:00,1022,Do Canada Goose jackets even cut it up there?
656364,bushart,2012-01-13 20:04:00,2628,Back in 1980 I was on a flight from Edmonton to Inuvik  They made a stop in Norman Wells----the pilot announced the outside air temp was -55  Then I'm wonderin if this was a good plan
656368,manitoubass2,2012-01-13 20:10:00,11391,"Winter seems to be setting here as well in NW Ontario. Not too cold but highs of -10-15 for the extended forecast.  Drifter, I use to work in northern Alberta, and it would get insanely cold too. Sometimes with the windchill it could reach -60 no problem. But the air was much drier there, and it wouldn't feel as cold as in NW Ontario.  Does that hold true for Yellowknife as well??? I mean it's still bloody cold, just a different kind of cold.  I'm just curious"
656369,mike rousseau,2012-01-13 20:13:00,4661,Highs of -20 saturday and -22 Sunday here...  Better bring the extra propane
656371,mercman,2012-01-13 20:20:00,7054,I froze my retinas just reading those temps Sheesh !!!!
656372,kuhaman,2012-01-13 20:26:00,503,That's what ya get for livin in Yellowknife   At least there's no snow in the forecast.
656373,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-13 20:30:00,10439,"  Yep, same kind of dry liquid nitrogen cold here as in Alberta."
656375,manitoubass2,2012-01-13 20:33:00,11391," lol, thanks for the reply. Thats actually a good way of putting it, lol.  It's always bad when your using a tiger torch on your own body to keep warm. Not such a good idea"
656378,misfish,2012-01-13 20:48:00,29133,"Like how they say REAL FEAL, not like here,wind chill makes it FEAL LIKE.   Like saying touch them,they feal real.LOL"
656379,Rod Caster,2012-01-13 20:48:00,5784,-26 in the AM here. That just means I'll have to build a fire near shore.
656381,troutologist,2012-01-13 20:56:00,951,Thats getting there! I'm hoping when I head north this winter its a little milder than that...not interested in sleeping in a tent in -50 or -60c.   On the home front I'm welcoming the cold as the ice on L Wpg has been unpredictable and a few trucks went through in the last few days. Warm and cold = cracks/ridges. A good year for the portable ice shacks.   Stay warm Dave!
656385,wormdunker,2012-01-13 21:09:00,1711,"minus 18 here in Sudbury with a windchill of -28C.  6"" of snow last night.  Now the sledders R all smiles.  High winds today, had to shut the crane down."
656415,Tybo,2012-01-13 22:14:00,1373,Don't know why the wind chill has anything to do with it.  How many nudist weather forecaster do you see in the WINTER.  :rofl2:
656417,wormdunker,2012-01-13 22:24:00,1711,U R right! There should be alot more (females)
656489,SirCranksalot,2012-01-14 04:25:00,3291,You folks new here? This is Canada---it's winter---it gets cold---it snows---get used to it!
656491,Skipper D,2012-01-14 04:34:00,1970,  Duc! i just thru a snow ball ......
656520,Rizzo,2012-01-14 14:26:00,4754,its ignorant cold out there this morning. Fingers were stinging within minutes of clearing the driveway...I guess next time I'll put on some gloves
656616,misfish,2012-01-14 23:42:00,29133,  Ya think
656639,JoshS,2012-01-15 01:08:00,729,"Wow, crazy temps.  Was just thinking about how last weekend was picking pike out of open water in light jacket.. miss that."
