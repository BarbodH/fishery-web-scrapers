655992,Pigeontroller,2012-01-12 20:09:00,2793,What exactly are you looking for? Leader material?
655995,Curtisss,2012-01-12 20:25:00,25,"Sorry, should have specified. I want it for tackle-making, both for spinner forms and through-wire for wooden baits."
656000,cheaptackle,2012-01-12 20:31:00,849,"Luremaking.com is a good place to order, if you know your specs try Brafasco or Fastenal.  Michael"
656015,Curtisss,2012-01-12 21:04:00,25,"That would work, but I learned long ago that I'm far too irresponsible for credit cards. So online ordering is out."
656037,bubbles,2012-01-12 22:16:00,591,"  We should all be so lucky, good for you."
656039,Billy Bob,2012-01-12 22:25:00,5865,"Tackle stores is probably the easiest place to start but you might find some for less money elsewhere....are you planning on selling the lures and need a lot or just a little for your own use.....what about hardware stores and maybe a piano/music store/repair shop...with Toronto being a very large city, you should be able to find some without a problem....get the diameter measurement and start calling around by using the yellow pages."
656040,Roy,2012-01-12 22:27:00,13728,"Curtisss, you don't need a credit card with Luremaking.com. Go to their site, have a look at what you need in their online catalogue and order it. These are the payment methods for Canadian customers. I buy my stuff from them too for the most part. Great service and super turn around time.  PAYMENT (Canada) Real Pro's SportFishing suggests payment by Visa, MasterCard, business cheque, personal cheque, or money order. All C.O.D. orders are cash only and available only to Canadian shipping addresses. Maximum C.O.D. is $999.00. All C.O.D.s are cash only."
656081,Tybo,2012-01-12 23:44:00,1373,Just make sure you ask for S.S cable. S.S wire is very expensive and it would't work very well for your use.
656262,bassjnkie,2012-01-13 14:41:00,1101,"I would definitely order from Lurmaking.com, great products and service."
656270,Curtisss,2012-01-13 14:54:00,25,Thanks everyone. I'll try out luremaking.com.  They're Canadian as well aren't they?
656273,Roy,2012-01-13 14:58:00,13728," Yes, they're in Hepworth, Ontario."
