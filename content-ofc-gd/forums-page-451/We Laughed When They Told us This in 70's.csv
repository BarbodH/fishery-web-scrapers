656282,bushart,2012-01-13 15:26:00,2628,Yup a car that runs on air---going into manufacturing in India  Another company in Austrailia working on it as well  I don't know how to do links--maybe somebody can help out?  
656283,danbouck,2012-01-13 15:27:00,4380,
656284,bushart,2012-01-13 15:28:00,2628,Thanks Dan---You da man
656285,Terry,2012-01-13 15:37:00,14456,"man that's a lot of pressure  I almost had my head blown off by a tire, I can not imagine what that"
656289,Jds63,2012-01-13 15:54:00,1365,"Neat video .... whether  its a great idea or dumb idea that remains to be seen , but as they said at the end of the video  …when the mainstream carmakers choose a direction of technology its hard for the small guy to convince a change of thought  I have driven the Volt and was impressed, its not for me but certainly for urban commuters it has its application. As with anything new in production , tweaking and refinement on the batteries will only get better (lighter and longer lasting).  The good thing is that manufacturers are spending more on R&D.  The next ten years cars will come with more in-dash technology than you can ever imagine (infotainment), and somehow they will convince everyone that they need to have it … LOL"
656291,Roy,2012-01-13 16:01:00,13728,"You could even have a trickle hose off the main air tank to keep your minnows alive in the back, eh?"
656294,cuzza,2012-01-13 16:14:00,467," For EVs and Hybrids I agree because of the batteries but can running a compressor to fill those air tanks really create as much pollution as a car doing 120 miles (bearing in mind that most cars in India are non-catalysed antiques).  My concern would driving around in a fibreglass box bolted to six aluminium pipes with 3 compressed air tanks at 4300psi underneath me, I know they're designed to vent forwards and backwards in the event of failure buit all that energy has to go somewhere. Tata tried to get a city car into Europe a few years ago and it failed every crash test woefully, I can't see this fairing any better."
656296,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-13 16:18:00,2690,  LOL...comment of the week goes to Roy.
656297,Billy Bob,2012-01-13 16:19:00,5865,NO NO NO....it was suppose to be a car that ran on WATER....see here...  http://www.videosurf.com/video/government-has-a-car-that-runs-on-water-man-1282394043?vlt=
656298,asdve23rveavwa,2012-01-13 16:21:00,2690," Store the minnows right in the ""fuel"" tank...even better."
656302,bushart,2012-01-13 16:27:00,2628,Whatever it is---it's heading in the right direction
656305,bushart,2012-01-13 16:37:00,2628,Here's the Austrailia story (Shorter)  Again if someone can help with the link  
656311,bushart,2012-01-13 16:53:00,2628,Well couple times they mentioned solar..but it's a start  I was just sharing a story about something kind of neat----not trying to start WWIII on wether or not it's a good idea or the pro's and cons of climate change and co2
656313,Fish4Eyes,2012-01-13 17:01:00,1022, I have herd of a guy who invented a engine that runs on water. He disappeared shortly after. Interesting
656321,cuzza,2012-01-13 17:30:00,467, Bushart - sorry  The technology is fascinating and the Australian application for forklifts etc. seem much more viable  This should do the embedding....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud1ofQVm6Fw&feature=endscreen&NR=1
656325,bushart,2012-01-13 17:39:00,2628,Thanks Cuzza--you also da man  this is still in it's infancy and will not change the world overnight---but it is heading in a positive direction  And like the saying goes---every journey starts with a single step
656327,_Ra_,2012-01-13 17:43:00,16,"   Electric cars/Hydrogen cars/Compressed air... its all the same concept, the energy still comes from a power plant which is most likely powered by fossil fuels. New power plant running on natural gas or other clean fossil fuels are more efficient and cleaner than an otto or a diesel engine. But energy storage adds extra ineffciencies to the equation. So you have Power Plant ineffeciency (40-50%)x Storage mean inefficiency (25-80%) vs Engine inefficiency (30%). <--- just some rough numbers. In the end its very hard to say which one is more efficient or cleaner without doing a study. They're probably equally bad."
656329,bubbles,2012-01-13 17:53:00,591,"They have to keep trying, I wonder what the comments were when the gas powered engine was first designed, I will bet that guy was nuts too!!!!  I wish I could find that forum."
656331,bushart,2012-01-13 17:57:00,2628,Quick somebody throw a net over Orville and Wilbur----those fools think they can fly
656333,Skipper D,2012-01-13 18:04:00,1970,"All i know is , if you want to see one of those little air cars get up and bogie , just take a hammer and knock shut off vavle off her ........ zooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom  "
656387,Big Cliff,2012-01-13 21:13:00,6899,Time for a group hug me thinks!
656388,ecmilley,2012-01-13 21:15:00,2163,I though for sure you were gonna say the leafs were winning the cup..............
656445,pics,2012-01-14 01:14:00,1268,We can charge our electric cars with solar on our roof tops....Oh crap..that means we would all have to work nights so the car is home during the day....nevermind..
