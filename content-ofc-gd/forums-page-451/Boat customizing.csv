656105,irishfield,2012-01-13 00:54:00,26272,I'm sure it's a good product used in the right circumstances cosmos. I wouldn't want to be painting a boat with rattle cans though. I'm a firm believer in following a paint system from start to finish. That means using a manufactures complete system from start to finish. Not one companies primer.. anothers paint.

656261,Sinker,2012-01-13 14:39:00,8692,"When I painted my aluminum, I just sanded what was there, cleaned it with an acetone soaked rag, and applied paint. That was 5 years ago, and its holding up pretty good. If your painting bare aluminum, you need a self etching primer for sure. The only place the paint came off mine was on the tops of the gunnels, where it was bare aluminum, and I didn't use primer on it.  I just used paint from Rona. I think it was called expressions or something. Exterior paint. I wanted ultra flat, in the colour of dead grass. They colour matched it for me from a handful of dead bullrushes. So far so good. There are a few spots on the inside that get a beating where the paint has been scraped off, but I would expect that from any paint job.  S."

655528,Ainsley,2012-01-11 04:55:00,142,"Gave your pics a good look and they do look very similar. I wish mine had a split windshield, I end up climbing around the side of the windshield to cast off the bow.  I'm planning on getting some Teak or an alternative (Iroko or Ipe) and doing the trim around the interior as well as some other little accent pieces. I've contemplated putting an electric trolling motor on her but have yet to decide if it would be better with a foot control or 'tiller' style. It would definitely need to go on the stern and I would have to make up some kind of bracket or plate in aluminum.  I ended up finding out that the transom had some rot around the motor mount bolt holes so after i removed as much of the punky wood as I could I injected epoxy to stabilize the remaining rot and then installed a stainless plate to strengthen the whole area.

656045,Skipper D,2012-01-12 22:32:00,1970,"  You should be fine if thats what your planning on doing and yes thats simple and afordable , touch the aluminum making it bare and your into a hole new game to where you have to prep the aluminum to take paint other wise it will never stick for any amount of time , in that case there is an acid wash that needs to be done , then a vinyl coating to apply before panting , last one i did would have been mid 90's and now who knows what the new process in ."
656051,irishfield,2012-01-12 22:41:00,26272," Remember the top coat is only as good as what's underneath it! If the old paint is ""loose"" in anyway the top coat will come off as well... so I'd be putting the aluminum compatible stripper to it and then after throughly cleaning a self etch primer and PPG top coat.  If you have a good base.. sure scuff and top it. Pending how old a Lund.. it's probably PPG Concept or the lastest version of same. Find a shop with the PPG paint rail to mix for you or just swing in with the boat and have them shoot it... with paint that is."

656095,irishfield,2012-01-13 00:18:00,26272,Heat gun the decals off.. clean it.. scuff it and shoot some new paint where needed. If it doesn't go to bare spots I don't know what you need if any primer at all.. I don't paint I just deliver my stuff to the local shop and go pick it up! lol. PPG does have a self etch primer for aluminum though... so you use their entire system. Any GOOD paint shop knows what to do with aluminum these days with it on so many cars.
