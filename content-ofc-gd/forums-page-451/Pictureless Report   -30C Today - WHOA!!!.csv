Felt like the lake had been fished out  I got to check another lake on my way down and to my surprise, no fishing huts in sight    Guess will have to wait another couple of weeks to target walleyes  So this is my report for today and looking forward to heading back out there Safe ice is not upon us yet for some... please play it safe!!! Tight lines Leechman"
656975,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-16 03:00:00,0,apparently their ontario cousins weren't biting either leech.  i made a long ski into some excellent brook trout lakes and only caught 2 fish in the last hour.  the only pics we took were of the icicles hanging off our beards when we got to the lake. i hope next weekend is better for both of us.

656978,bigugli,2012-01-16 03:25:00,6138,The bite will probably turn on with the start of the next thaw tomorrow
656979,Leecher,2012-01-16 03:27:00,7832, Could very well be Bruce
656984,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-16 03:58:00,0,i'm sure they'll bite great all week while i'm at work!
656989,Rod Caster,2012-01-16 05:26:00,5784,Rainbows were completely silent in the -25 temps on Saturday as well. What's the saying.... a bad day fishing is better than a good day working.
