656390,BillM,2012-01-13 21:29:00,17367,  Tell me about it!
656400,misfish,2012-01-13 21:45:00,29133,"Might be a tough go this weekend though. I,ll be out sunday. Gotz to work saturday."
656413,BillM,2012-01-13 22:11:00,17367,"I'm oncall all weekend, I'll get out early next week hopefully..  At least we are getting 4-5 days of below zero weather.  That should help lock things up (Although Simcoe is going to take a while)"
656499,lakemaster,2012-01-14 08:20:00,36,Good info now I am on my way to lake Simcoe this year when the ice harden and start snagging those white fish with the side hooks. I didn't know you can snag them while jigging hard I got to try that out this year thanks for the tip guys. I will let you guys know how many white fish I will snag this year. Just one question is it better to snagg them in the bottom or put the jig couple of inch of the bottom please let me know I want to snag one seriously. Lol jokes
656507,limeyangler,2012-01-14 13:22:00,5204,Ive only ever caught one thing on a williams whitefish thingy. A pretty impressive catch though i think. I jigged this guy up live on the ice from 60'FOW!    
656548,Eazy,2012-01-14 16:49:00,260,"Caught, snagged, or foul hooked???......Just joking!"
656549,OutdoorDan,2012-01-14 16:51:00,325,"Looks like the little guy is holding on himself!  60FOW that's crazy, I had no idea they lived that deep."
656593,kickingfrog,2012-01-14 20:59:00,8333,That's cause you don't snorkle that deep.
656613,misfish,2012-01-14 23:29:00,29133,UMMM garlic butter. Just need another 30 or so.
656651,Familyfisherman,2012-01-15 01:32:00,188,"Interesting comments.  The Williams ice jig is the top of the list for anyone targeting whitefish on Simcoe.  Also works for lakers, but the strategy is a bit different.  The side hooks can snag a fish, especially if, like many do, you rip the jig 6 feet off bottom.  If you fish it this way, you won't get half the fish, and you'll snag most of them.  The lure is to be used in the bottom 6 inches....slooooowly.  Most often as stated the fish press it to bottom or just barely tap it while it rests near bottom.  Use braid, flouro leader (6 or 8lb) and lift up, let it down, always hitting bottom.  Most fish will be on the treble, a few will have both the treble and the side hooks.  If you take them off you'll miss a few, but it still works fine.  No pearls, no minnows -- not necessary.  Hammered half and half is best imo.  Other strategies work, but I use this lure 85% of the time every time out...cause it works.  The gong show in spring when the fish school off Jackson's Point is a different story...TONNES of snaggers all ripping jigs and keeping illegal fish...it's rediculous.  But this isn't the lure's fault, it's the so called ""fishermen""..."
656661,NAW,2012-01-15 02:01:00,4022, That's because you got those side hooks pushed in to the center of the lure.  You need them right out on the edge of the spoon!   You said it Kev.  I couldn't agree more.
656790,Eazy,2012-01-15 15:18:00,260, For lakers you just fish higher in the water column?
656794,BillM,2012-01-15 15:34:00,17367," I've caught most of my lakers right off bottom, but yeah usually 10-15ft above bottom with a big tube or larger sized Willians spoon...  I get all my lakers on the chase..  I've had fish come out of 100ft of water after I've dropped my lure in the hole, hitting it 10ft below the ice..  The best is watching them on the graph coming up for the kill!!!"
655929,BillM,2012-01-12 16:15:00,17367," Great, so you aren't ganking whitefish like the other guys out on the lake.  But if you think that doesn't happen, you really need to spend more time out on the ice and witness it with your own eyes..  I spent enough days out there last year to see MANY fish come up ass first then be thrown on the ice.  I'm a good fisherman because I spend time on the water, it's got nothing to do with steelheading   But I appreciate the kudos."
655930,GbayGiant,2012-01-12 16:19:00,1780,  Bill has taken offense to what you have said because he practices what he preaches. I agree with you. It is very hard to snag something you cannot see when it is 90 feet away from you. Just because you see a fish on your fish finder does not mean it is right under you.
655933,BillM,2012-01-12 16:29:00,17367," I really haven't taken offense to anything..  Myself and many other have seen legitimate snagging of whitefish out on Simcoe..  Ask around to anyone who spends a decent amount of time on the ice chasing these things...  If anything, it's EASIER through the ice because you're presentation is completely vertical.. A big weighted treble + some braid and it really doesn't matter how deep you are fishing..  Does it happen by mistaken?  Absolutely it does, but are people out there doing it on purpose?  You better believe it.."
655940,richyb,2012-01-12 16:35:00,774,   Your right I dont spend very much time on simcoe. Once there is safe ice I might miss 1 day before the end of the season. This year I will try to make it out everyday IF we ever get some ice. I dont like fishing close enough to people to tell if their fish is coming out of the hole backwards or not. Its a big lake I dont need to be that close to someone.
655956,Nipfisher,2012-01-12 17:36:00,2449,Isn't this thread about Williams spoons?
656181,Eazy,2012-01-13 03:14:00,260,Yeup!......Looks like its been jacked!
656182,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-13 03:15:00,10439,  
656186,richyb,2012-01-13 03:20:00,774,"  Sorry about that. It is still about the ice jig and views on using it. Dont worry if you leave on the side hooks and use it in deep water jigging, only a small % of people will call you a snagger. I leave mine on when fishing on the ice and take them off when fishing in my hut. I take them off in the hut because I use a net and they are a pain in the butt to get un tangled."
656189,Eazy,2012-01-13 03:24:00,260, LMAO!
656190,BillM,2012-01-13 03:24:00,17367," Whoops, I guess we should get back on topic, lol!  I usually remove mine because I find the fish tend to wrap up in them and get hooked in the eye/face/whatever."
656192,Eazy,2012-01-13 03:29:00,260,"Without the hooks, wouldn't they basically be a normal Williams Whitefish,turned upside down,an excellent lure nonetheless!"
656195,GbayGiant,2012-01-13 03:38:00,1780,Wasn't the 'Williams ice jig' designed for Lake Simcoe orginally? The side hooks were added just to help catch whitefish with how they feed off bottom.   
656206,OutdoorDan,2012-01-13 05:05:00,325," BillM,  You started with a good argument but then you shifted goalposts from side hooks on a lure to big weighted trebles with braided line and now your argument has lost all meaning.  Whether you choose to leave on or take off the side hooks on a the Williams does not make you any more or less of a snagger.  The way you jig the lure might, but it has little do with the choice of what to do with the side hooks.  The thread started with a great question and good input on the pros and cons, then you came in and put people that leave on the side hooks into the same bucket as people that rip trebles off the bottom with braided line."
656208,BillM,2012-01-13 05:13:00,17367," I'm sorry you couldn't follow along, my apologies."
656209,Freshtrax,2012-01-13 05:16:00,2215,I guess the mnr should ban all hooks bigger than size 8.  Hey you musky and pike guys should change your trebbles to barbless trout hooks so you dont get one stuck in the fish's eye/face/whatever  during battle.  Nothing personal bill just trying to point out the hooks are useful and legal.
656210,BillM,2012-01-13 05:26:00,17367," No one said you were out there snagging whities on purpose.  You asked a question, you got an answer..   The fact is the side hooks do snag whitefish once in a while.  No big deal, reel them up, unhook them and put them back down the hole.  I'm not quite sure how people got confused between unintentional snagging (which happens to all of us) and the guys ripping giant trebles off the bottom and bringing the fish up ass first."
656212,Freshtrax,2012-01-13 05:40:00,2215,Thankyou for removing us of those who catch fish on the sidehooks from the same  bucket as snaggers.  Now if someone could tell me how to catch more lakers on a williams ice jig i am all ears.. I get the odd one but i am in no way confident in using it to target lakers with i get most of my lakers on live bait.
656214,BillM,2012-01-13 05:47:00,17367," Dude, the lakers don't like me either.  Don't take it personally, lol."
656215,manitoubass2,2012-01-13 05:53:00,11391, My 8 year old son has landed 6 more lakers then me. We have gone for them twice...   
656221,OutdoorDan,2012-01-13 09:53:00,325," I did follow along fine and I'm on your side with regards to intentional snagging on Simcoe a) happening  being despicable, it's just that I don't think any of that belongs in this thread... As you can tell from some of the replies people get worked up about being grouped with people that do unethical/illegal things just because of technique.  As a steelheader I'm sure you are very familiar with the stigma some people get when they use a technique other than floatfishing, but why open that can of worms?  If people want to snag they will find ways to do it side hooks or not.  However I believe a good majority of people who are doing the 4 foot swoops with their rod on Simcoe are doing it out of lack of knowledge and not because of bad intentions.  Anyways my point is that side hooks are really not the root of the snagging problem on Simcoe, and that the goal should be to educate people the proper technique with them, not get rid of them.  Good luck on the ice this winter.    "
656260,Sinker,2012-01-13 14:32:00,8692,"You can snag them just the same with a meegs/badboy type lure too.  If its hooked in the face, its dinner. Get a camera down there and have a look at what they're doing while your jigging. You would be surprised how many times they miss your lure. I've also seen them hover over the jig, like Harrison mentioned.  It happens, there's not much you can do about it. I find it more fun to make them bite myself, but I see plenty of people out there rip jigging them, and keeping them. IMO, keeping the foul hooked fish is probably better than releasing them. AFter you fight a foul hooked fish, they are beat. I'm not sure if many of them survive.  S."
656267,GbayGiant,2012-01-13 14:51:00,1780,Foul hooking and snagging are two different animals. Snagging means you are purposely hooking fish the wrong way. Foul hooking is by accident. So when you say that people are unintentionally snagging. It's none sense.  
656280,Harrison,2012-01-13 15:12:00,2202," I rarely get the lakers on the metal. The odd time if one comes in hot and spun and just smokes it.  IMO, the flash brings them in and the plastic (tube, swimbait etc.) or live bait is usually what they eat once in the area."
656290,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-13 15:54:00,10439, I stick a shiner or chunk of cisco on the treble hook to increase my laker hooking percentage. You will catch fewer whitefish though.
656301,Rustic-Fisher,2012-01-13 16:25:00,826,"I take them off,  seem to always be in the way. Having said that, if someone watched me they may think I'm ripping fish. Aggressive jigging (3-5' jigs) to create a bunch of flash to bring them on the screen and than its either back to the bottom for those finesse fish or reeling it away from them and getting a strike 30' up over 70' ofw for those aggressive fish. When on bottom my jigs are nothing more than steady flutters right on bottom to stir the sediment up. Eyes glued to the electronics the whole time. Every year in Temagami thou I do try and jig up a few lakers on the stick just to do it old school. R"
655702,Freshtrax,2012-01-11 21:06:00,2215,"Like i said i ""get allot of stikes while its laying on the bottom"". How can i snag a fish while the lure is not moving just curious?"
655709,Spiel,2012-01-11 21:21:00,9065," Answer, they come into look at the lure, brush against the line, rod tip twitches.....set the hook, dang....fouled, it does happen, often."
655710,BillM,2012-01-11 21:26:00,17367, We've got a winner!!!
655712,kickingfrog,2012-01-11 21:31:00,8333,"A fish not caught in the mouth or very near the mouth is ""snagged"". It is possible to snag a fish unintentional. The fish is required to be released, whether is was snagged unintentional or not. ""Snagging"" or ""snaggin'"" is a term often used to describe when people are intentionally trying to snag fish.   Another note: Some other areas do allow snagging of some fish, or some fish at certain times."
655714,kickingfrog,2012-01-11 21:41:00,8333," I also suspect sometimes that hooks that are in the mouth come lose during the fight. Fish do ""miss"" the lure sometimes, at least the business end. I'm sure most of us have watched a fish strike at, and miss a crankbait over and over? Sometimes they get the trebles in the cheek."
655721,fishnsled,2012-01-11 21:59:00,3520," Yep but explain this one. I had a tip up with a minnow on it. I was walking over to check it when the tip up goes down fast. Grab the line and start pulling, feels like a good fish. The fish comes up the hole and on the ice and I go to unhook it. The problem is that the fish in not hooked, instead it is lassoed around it's body once.  I'm guessing it rolled and the hook popped out but caught the line and made the lasso around the body and the pectoral fins. When pulling the fish up I just noticed the line and figured it had swallowed the hook. What was strange was the fight felt like a normal hook up.  As for the side hooks, I leave them on and don't seem to have a problem with them. A snap on the spoon and swivel a couple of feet up. I've had whities with the spoons T-boned in the mouth and the side hooks is what got he fish. Might try tying direct as Aaron and Tony showed in the video that Aaron put up. That's if we get some decent ice to get out on."
655722,BillM,2012-01-11 22:06:00,17367,"I think whities do all kinds of stupid stuff when they're hooked.  I've had them hooked in the side of the face after jigging them up 40ft from the bottom, lol."
655723,misfish,2012-01-11 22:08:00,29133,I lassoed a rainbow one spring.True story.Blew my mind how that could happen.Released it.
655724,BillM,2012-01-11 22:09:00,17367,"Brian, I've had hooks pop only to gank them in the side.  That small fish sure turns into a big fish in a hurry"
655731,misfish,2012-01-11 22:23:00,29133,lol
655737,Freshtrax,2012-01-11 22:50:00,2215,I catch about 20 every year on the sidehooks on the INSIDE of the mouth..yes i get  the occasional foul.  What i think happens is the whitefish mouthes the lure as its laying on the bottom of the lake realizes its a hunk of metal down there not a baitfish and  tries to spit it out but the oversized hooks catch on the way out.  8/10 times there hooked in the verry front of the mouth when i get a strike on the bottom..simalar idea to using circle hooks on catfish  Edited for spelling
655742,misfish,2012-01-11 23:15:00,29133,  Good post.Very true.
655814,Eazy,2012-01-12 02:12:00,260,"Probably be a good spoon for Lakers, as good as any other williams lure.."
655821,Sinker,2012-01-12 02:31:00,8692,"If your jiggin a william whitefish with the side hooks properly, you don't foul hook many fish. Sure, it happens, but not very often. The truth of the matter is, most guys have no clue how to work them, and just end up ripping them, and snagging fish.  S."
655848,NAW,2012-01-12 03:49:00,4022, Exactly what I was thinking.
655894,Nipfisher,2012-01-12 13:19:00,2449,"  Brian, You can have all of our herring from Nipissing for all I care. They are a pain in the butt when targeting walleye and they stink up the hut."
655904,BillM,2012-01-12 14:47:00,17367,Open herring so I can use them as dead bait in the spring for pike!
655908,misfish,2012-01-12 15:08:00,29133, What a waste. I love my smoked herring.    I hear their wormy.

655913,johnnyb,2012-01-12 15:31:00,3413,I pulled a wormy herring out of Nip this year....but just the one...didn't have others to compare it to.  Next time I'll likely chuck'em in the freezer and save them for the pike
655914,BillM,2012-01-12 15:34:00,17367," I can't eat fish, so using them to catch bigger fish is the next best thing!"
655918,richyb,2012-01-12 15:43:00,774,"I find it funny that you guys think that someone is trying to snag fish in 80, 90 fow. People have been JIGGING on simcoe for how many years? They dont call it JIGGLE YOUR SPOON ON BOTTOM. I Just us a flick of my wrist and jig the spoon maybe 6-8 inches at a time in a constant jig always keeping the spoon moving. Sure I get foul hooked fish ( everyone does) but trying to snag in 90 FOW?  give me a break. Everyone has a different style of jigging and just because some of you guys diddle your spoon on bottom doesnt mean you can call out everyone else for snagging. Tip ups are likely the biggest % of snagging there is. Lots of times the fish will take a run at it, hit the line and the angler hooks the fish in the belly. Are they trying to snag fish ? no but it happens."
655921,BillM,2012-01-12 15:52:00,17367,"Yeah you're right.  No one snags whitefish on Simcoe...  Are you one of those guys with the big wooden stick ripping your 'dressed' treble hook 2-3ft of the bottom?  If so, I can tell why you might take this thread personally, lol!!!!"
655922,johnnyb,2012-01-12 15:52:00,3413,"The way I read it, it didn't sound like they were calling ""everyone else"" out for snagging.  The guys ripping 2 and 3 feet up....when they know there's a school of fish there (easy to do with electronics) are the one's they're talking about.  Lots and lots of people fish Simcoe...no question there is a lot of rule breaking going on...same as the way the salmon run brings them out.  "
655926,richyb,2012-01-12 16:04:00,774,  I dont dress my treble with anything and my jig is only 6-8 inches long. Yes I use a jigging stick because thats the way it started on simcoe and it works so why change it? Id rather get a hit on the stick than a rod. Your a steelheader so I guess your the much better fisherman and are always right because steelheaders are a breed of their own.
655158,Eazy,2012-01-10 04:11:00,260,"Do these hooks really serve their purpose?......Seem to have a lot of ""hog-ties"" with this bait, wondering if other members find the same?"
655159,BassAsin,2012-01-10 04:15:00,806,"the williams whitefish always came with them, i can't stand them,  make a mess in the line while jigging, always tangled, never have i have i had a fish come up with just one of them hooks holding the fish, toss em and use a trailer hook."

Have you tried a leader that's more stiff?  Maybe bump up to a higher # fluo leader.  I've never had significant problems with line getting tangled in the hooks.  It is extremely annoying when those side hooks catch the side of the hole, though."
655179,Sinker,2012-01-10 05:41:00,8692,"If its getting tangled, your doing something wrong. I never use a snap swivel. Always just a snap, with an inline swivel a couple feet above it.  It wont work right with the side hooks if you tip it with a minnow. Jig it clean.  If your tipping with minnows, take the side hooks off.  I would never take them off for whities, but most other fish, I tip with a minnow, so take them off and upgrade the trebles one size. Whities will pick that spoon up from the bottom, and the side hooks get them in the face every time. I also like to pull the side hooks out to the sides as far as I can, and pinch them good with pliers so they stay there.  I wouldn't ice fish if I couldn't jig a williams!!! Go to lure for EVERYTHING!!  S."
655181,Freshtrax,2012-01-10 06:21:00,2215,Lol i replace them with huge oversized sidehooks a whitie cant even look at it without getting a facefullof hooks.  I get allot of hookups while it is laying on the bottom on the lake.  They like to pushdown on the lure into the lakebottom

655676,NAW,2012-01-11 19:58:00,4022,"I keep them on.  I've caught a few fish on the side hooks (in the mouth).  Last year was weird, I didn't get a single foul hooked fish using a Williams.  I usually get a few throughout the year."
655679,Grimace,2012-01-11 20:01:00,2020,I have witnessed it on Simcoe many times.  The schools get pretty thick.  They open those hooks up on the side of the Williams and just reef on them.   Lots of them come up on the side of the face or like Bill says by the tail or back.
655682,NAW,2012-01-11 20:06:00,4022,"  Ya, Simcoe is really bad for guys ripping on Williams spoons.  Big, long, fast, hard cranks.  Blatantly obvious they're snagging fish.  When I jig a williams, it's just short little pops off bottom.  Maybe an 2 or 3"".  You see some of these guys out there ripping them 2 or 3 meters off bottom...."
655683,misfish,2012-01-11 20:11:00,29133,"  LOL Yea,then they all huddle around the hole so no one can see it,s snagged.  I had one where I could see it was fouled,and a guy even still tried to gaff it for me. Told him to get the faway."
655684,Harrison,2012-01-11 20:11:00,2202,"While I have no doubt some folks do intentionally foul hook some fish.  I've iced quite a few whitefish foul hooked, usually under the mouth or in the belly.  I watched on a camera one time why this happens.  Most the time they would come flying in on the bait and either lose it or protect it from others by hovering themselves over it.  Jsut a theory, but it sure looks that way.  Guys who have seen them on camera have possibly witnessed the same thing."
655686,Grimace,2012-01-11 20:23:00,2020,Interesting.  That would explain why I get the odd one foul hooked and I don't reef up on the bait.  I do see lots of guys trying to (successfully I might add) snag them.  That could be a reason why they are so successful.
655693,BillM,2012-01-11 20:49:00,17367,"I've got a couple in the side of the head, you can really tell when you can't get their heads up into the hole.  There is blatant snagging (guys reefing 3ft with their wooden sticks) then the fish that circle and hit and get wrapped up..  It happens.."
