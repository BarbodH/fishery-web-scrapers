656228,lakerguy,2012-01-13 12:51:00,224,Would anyone happen to know if there is a motel in Powassan?  Close to snowmobile trails would be great  Or that general area  Any help would be great Thanks
656232,Roy,2012-01-13 13:08:00,13728,"PM Bernie, he should be able to point you in the right direction."
656233,lakerguy,2012-01-13 13:13:00,224,Ok Thanks Roy
656251,vance,2012-01-13 14:08:00,719,They tore down the last motel this summer and I think the nearest is in Trout creek (10k)south or in north bay.  vance
656263,ketchenany,2012-01-13 14:43:00,3229,"I have a Windsor Hotel listed in my Ontario Accommodation Guide, if they are still around.  507 Main Street POwassan ON 705.724.2029.  There is also a B&B  Satis House B&B 258 ENglish Line 705.724.2187"
656271,Rod Caster,2012-01-13 14:54:00,5784,Nothing left in the town of Powassan. Your best bet is probably Terrace Suites in Callander. They are right near the trail system and offer snowmobiler packages.
656287,lakerguy,2012-01-13 15:42:00,224,Thanks for the help fellas  I just found out the place in trout Creek isnt very close to a trail. Will give the Callender a try
656307,woodenboater,2012-01-13 16:40:00,2277,South River too far south from your trails ?
656314,Ron,2012-01-13 17:05:00,1683,Moesey ON Inn is the place you want to stay at. We leave from there right onto the trails and they have no problem with us leaving the truck and trailer behind as we do a 5 or 6 day trip.
656318,bassman87,2012-01-13 17:22:00,586," its because of the stripclub ron, no need to lie"
656319,Terry,2012-01-13 17:24:00,14456,"OH OH  from the stories I have heard, OFC OFC and strip clubs don't mix well  don't ask"
656322,Headhunter,2012-01-13 17:30:00,5703,Is it because of the poles Terry! HH
656360,lakerguy,2012-01-13 19:38:00,224,"LOL I been there a few times  This run is with my son,hes 12"
656370,Ron,2012-01-13 20:17:00,1683, Even better!  He can gain the experience of snowmobiling ethics during the day and understand why it is important to KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT when you get back home to talk to Mama!
656419,lakerguy,2012-01-13 22:32:00,224, Haha I hear ya...  Cheers  Thanks all for the help
