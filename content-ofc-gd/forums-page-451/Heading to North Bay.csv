656633,squirrel761,2012-01-15 00:57:00,30,We're heading up to North Bay from goderich next weekend and was wondering if anyone could tell me where a good place to park the car and walk out onto the ice. i've fished Callendar Bay quite a bit in the summer but always stayed at a friends cottage. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
656653,spud7378,2012-01-15 01:43:00,68,you can park at the government dock in callander and walk out from there! fishing is not great but we are getting a few and its easy to walk out in the bay!!  http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&tab=wl
656655,NAW,2012-01-15 01:46:00,4022,There's a nice park in downtown Northbay.  Lots of parking.  Waterfront.   Oh ya..  Welcome to OFC.   Your from Godrich eh..  I was raised near there.  How'd ya hold up against that tornado?
656660,squirrel761,2012-01-15 01:59:00,30,Thanks Kevin. I know the docks. We usually troll along the front of the point in the summer and out to the A frame. Our friends cottage is at Green Roads. I see that a lot of the operators are out by the A frame. Looking forward to going.We usually do Cooks Bay on Simcoe but it's just got to the point of being able to walk on it so we're going to wait a couple of weeks before we head there. Tight lines to everyone
656664,squirrel761,2012-01-15 02:06:00,30,"Hello Nick. We are staying at a hotel near Sunset Park. It looks to be on the water. May try that as well. We were about 5 blocks from the main part of the storm. Lost a couple of sections of fence, that's all. I work at the Salt Mine and we'll be ages getting everything put back together. Town sure looks different with over 1000 trees missing. I'm originally from the big town of Brussels     Thanks for asking and the info"
656665,NAW,2012-01-15 02:10:00,4022, I was raised in Swingin Wingham...  Lots of buddies in Brussels.  Spent many a drunkin night there.  So..  How many DUI's have you got..  Everyone from Brussels has had atleast one.
656812,bow slayer,2012-01-15 17:21:00,1074,you could try parking in Callender along the water and walking out .There is usually parking at marina and beach and you won't have far to walk out by the lighthouse.If you are feeling ambtious enough you could also walk out to the group of huts out in the middle of the bay.

656885,squirrel761,2012-01-15 22:21:00,30,Thanks Bowslayer. I know the lighthouse  and depending how cold it is I don't mind the walk. I like to move around and with a 2 man Clam it's not that bad. Sounds like it's going to be great ice making weather up there so counting down the days.
