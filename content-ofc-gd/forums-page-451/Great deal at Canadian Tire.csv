656213,Freshtrax,2012-01-13 05:45:00,2215,I paid almost that much for my otter pro draw bar and hitch for the sled. Great deal indead
656224,Billy Bob,2012-01-13 11:27:00,5865,Not a deal.....sounds like a STEAL....
656231,Rod Caster,2012-01-13 13:06:00,5784,Hmmmmm??? Should I?
656237,kickingfrog,2012-01-13 13:47:00,8333,"I'd consider it, but it's January 13th and Kempenfelt Bay is wide open. I already dropped $500 on gear I haven't used yet."
656252,johnnyb,2012-01-13 14:10:00,3413,That really is a fantastic deal....wonder how many stores have it in stock?

656274,johnnyb,2012-01-13 14:58:00,3413,"Is that for real, Bubbles?  Did you call and ask?    Wouldn't surprise me"
656279,Skipper D,2012-01-13 15:08:00,1970,  Wonder if any diehards are still putting boats in and out ?
656286,Lunker777,2012-01-13 15:37:00,866,guys fishing out of tinnys down here near Chatham I have been told.
656309,quickme,2012-01-13 16:48:00,261,"  Probably doesn't apply to you Johnnyb but the CT at McCowan and Sheppard is sold out ( No Rainchecks either.  They have 1 in pickering, 1 in Uxbridge and 2 at Markham and 14th.  this was at 11:30.  Too bad its too far for me to drive there during my lunch.  Seems like a good deal.  I would love to hear some feedback from anyone that has one or buys one.  Nick"
656310,Harrison,2012-01-13 16:52:00,2202, Fishing from a tinny tomorrow.
656328,GoneFishin,2012-01-13 17:49:00,349,That's a hell of a deal! I wonder what this weather is going to do for ice fishing sales. Might want to save some money for the end of season boys. They might have to clear a lot more product the expected lol.
656330,bubbles,2012-01-13 17:55:00,591,  no but if history is any indication and I was a betting man.....
656347,I'mHooked,2012-01-13 18:48:00,525,Just picked up the only one on the shelf at the Burlington Mall location. Hmmm....which room to play in...dining room or living room?   I'm sure Simcoe will freeze one of these days!
656358,cityfisher,2012-01-13 19:23:00,959,on the website still shows the REG price  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Fishing/IceFishing/PRDOVR~0787717P/Eskimo+Ice+Fishing+Value+Pack.jsp?locale=en
656398,I'mHooked,2012-01-13 21:42:00,525,"Well here's mine set up! Had to open it in the basement...much better half wouldn't allow anywhere else.    It's much more robust than I was expecting. All the windows are a very soft pliable plastic that are removable. It has a blackout lining on the inside. With all windows closed it's black inside! I'm quite pleased. Just have to figure out how get both people AND the sled it came with in the car! The sled is 60"" long, includes a nice cover and the chair is quite sturdy and rated 250lbs.  Looking forward to trying this baby out! Woohoo!  Oh, and it did ring in at $199 at the till."

656426,Roy,2012-01-13 22:59:00,13728, Wanna scare the bejeezus out of her. Wait until she's asleep tonight and fire up the power auger down there.
656437,I'mHooked,2012-01-14 00:28:00,525," Aw, ya mean now I've got to go get a power auger?  Yay! I'll tell her Roy said it's ok!"
