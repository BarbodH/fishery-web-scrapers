Use a glow bead, or natural egg colour, instead of a white pearl on a spreader or just above live bait rig?  Heck if it's on fire, maybe even lower down a single bead rigged up with the single egg hook behind it a few inches.  Hopefully Simcoe is frozen by February and I might give some beads a try."
