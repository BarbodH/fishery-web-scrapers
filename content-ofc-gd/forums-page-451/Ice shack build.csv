655968,Mikeyfish,2012-01-12 18:25:00,21,"I'm new a member and triing to figure this site out.I spent 3 years figuring out my shack (6x8 )to the way I wanted and it is built very comfortly for two, never have to block it up, never bank it with snow and it lifts up and ready to move in less than 30 seconds even when it is froze in the ice 3 inches, usuing a battery operated drill. I have atempted to make videos and will get better at them and I building the site too,it's slow but you can see my shack On the Winter Video page click on the (Fishing Mikey Style) video and there is another ( raising the shack) And the (ideers) page is the ice hut ideas good luck  www.fishingmikeystyle.ca"

655978,fishnsled,2012-01-12 18:44:00,3520,Awesome idea on the raising and lowering. That shack sure looks great and well thought out!
655986,Jds63,2012-01-12 19:33:00,1365,Wow that looks like a great rig !!! The shack is awesome too
655987,discophish,2012-01-12 19:37:00,392,"Wow, that's an awesome lift system.  Great job with the design.  Can this be installed on my Jeep?"
655996,bubbles,2012-01-12 20:26:00,591,That is Fantastic
656022,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-01-12 21:26:00,83,"Very clever, nice interior as well."

656102,woodenboater,2012-01-13 00:48:00,2277,"GOOD GOD MAN !!! If this is how you normally roll, I'm supremely impressed    Never thought I'd ever see office chairs in a hut but they definitely look better than benches or milk crates lol.  Would love to see the truck in action with those tracks under it and hauling the 'office'."
656156,Mikeyfish,2012-01-13 02:21:00,21,"  Thanx  I read the rules again and I didn't think I was spaming and I'm sorry for that.I looked all over to re edit my post and could not figure out how to do this.It's funny I don't think of this as a real busness  because I have never charged a person a penny for fishing, I make my toys interesting and I charge a small fee for a bussiness to hang their decales,helps pay for some gas and my home made toys ,there is more time invested in making them than there is any money to be made. I can see someone thinking this is a real fishing business.This is all fun for me catching fish, building toys and now sharing some of my ideas .Again I apoligise Exuse my spelling but I can't find the spell check here"
656161,irishfield,2012-01-13 02:26:00,26272,"No spell check here.. that I can find at least... and the brunt of many jokes around here for some.  Welcome aboard, some great looking inventions on your site. Why I linked direct to the Youtube video address so all could see your hut jacks and such easily."
656178,Nipfisher,2012-01-13 03:08:00,2449,Great Job Mikey. Just curious what you do for a living? Must be a mechanic of sorts?
