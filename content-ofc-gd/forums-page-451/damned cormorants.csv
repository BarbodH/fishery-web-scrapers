We've already established the “do you eat them” question is a bit moot on 2 angles.  Angle 1- There are MANY species open to hunting/trapping which we don‘t traditionally eat.... Both native & invasive species alike are currently hunted legally in Ontario purely for sporting 	fun. Really anyone expecting the birds unpleasant flavour to be some sort of  valid reason for 	being granted sanctuary….your jest has been answered as irrelvant by a LONG standing precedent.  Angle 2- Who cares? If I wants to blast the bird for fun does that make me a crazy cold hearted Red neck jerk.... Before you label me you should ask your self if you ever fished with live bait.

They are native and should be allowed to exist and will find a balance in their numbers eventually. (remember the passenger pigeon anyone?) As far as their range goes, the weather patterns have changed on the past several decades which have allowed all species to increase their range further north than in the recent hisyorical past. There is proof of this everywhere. This is not my opinion-it is fact. It is good to hear that the MNR is doing some culling but IMO some areas need to be more aggressive in this area. It is true that the tree huggers will protest if outright culling occurs publicly. The best bet is to open them to a hunting season. All my 2 cents"

I am drawn towards Docs ideas on this matter.Nature will take its course eventually.The problem with that, is that nature moves very slowly, and our lifespan is like a mere spec in time. Most of us live for instant gratification in this life. The only times when ''Nature'' seems to move quickly, is when man has a hand in it. Bob mentions Skunks and rabid racoons, and i personally have had many problems with them over the last couple of years.But i look around my neighborhood, and i see all the greenspace and forests that use to surround my home are all gone, and filled with unsold condos.These creatures certainly do not like living under my shed or deck, nor do they like being in contact with my two dogs. Eventually, they will disappear, whether it takes months or years.Its up to me to deter them from living in my space. The world of Political correctness that we live in, dictates how we deal with situations like the cormorant, or any other living creature that gets out of control. Do i like the Cormorants? Hell no.Do i believe we should hunt them down like we did with wolves years ago? Hell no.Do i think that something should be done to give mother nature a hand in stabilizing the population of thse birds? Hell yes. We have to leave the methods up to the people we put in charge of this problem.It is their mandate, and we should be letting them know how we all feel about it."

655950,troutologist,2012-01-12 17:13:00,951,"Without a doubt there are changes occurring in the natural environment in recent history. New/invasive species colonizing, once expatriated species recolonizing, extinctions etc. These are tangible changes to be readily observed by astute individuals that spend time in the woods and waters. If folks frequent an area for a number of years, its natural they will notice trends and make comparisons between years, decades etc.  No doubt that for the reasons mentioned previously, lets throw in changing climatic conditions as another driver here, the changes in populations, food chain dynamics and finally ecosystems are happening at a rate faster than previously recorded. This is a fact that hurts scientific rigor insomuch that by the time the process of a study is carried out, further changes may have occurred, leaving a whole new set of questions.  In my line of work, hearing local ecological knowledge is important since the holders of said knowledge are much closer to the resource and can give clues to its changes or trends. What is often lost from this local knowledge or anecdotal observations is the WHY. Saying there are less fish around is one thing, but getting to the root of why this has happened is another issue completely.  There are always ""sexy"" issues in the media, the spring bear hunt, cormorants, invasives etc. Before undertaking something like mass culling the Gov't no doubt needs to have a number of scientific questions answered, so they can make the best decision (with the information available at that time). Focusing on border issues, like nutrient loads, sedimentation, habitat loss and other anthropogenic outputs will be much better issues to lobby various levels of Gov't about.  Good that folks are concerned about the resources, maybe it will turn out cormorants need artificial population controls, but before culling or introducing another cormorant eating bird, I'd like to wait for someone to ask the appropriate questions and go about answering them in a careful, analytical manner."

As far as these birds, it's considered different because they influence what we like to partake in, fishing and wilderness.  It's a problem for  us, because we view them as depleting our past time, and our so called resource. In reality it's not really our resource, it belongs to all of nature. Not just our ""just for me mentality"".  On the other hand, we depend on unbiased scientist to count and decifer the data. They never actually do anything to correct or worsen the situation. The information is handed off to organizations etc to be dealt with. That's where the biased always enters, whether it be policy, money or whatever, scientist just tell us the numbers, and possible problems/solutions etc.  As far as numbers go, it's vital that anglers play a part. If anglers are noticing increased numbers or absurd numbers then listen to them. Anglers watch everything on the water (for the most part) and IMO have a solid reference to what they see/experience. Anglers are like a skateboarder. A skateboarder sees an angled piece of concrete with a rail attached, he thinks ""cool, I can grind that"". An onlooker merely walks by without noticing the rail. Anglers are the same way on the water, noticing very detail, take their experience to further credibility.  Dr. Sal, no personal attack, but alot of times you don't take anyones personal experience into account. And at times, come off as a real ""know it all"". If you actually follow science, then maybe listen and take all things into account. After all, thats what a good scientist would do, correct?  Good thread here, carry on.  "

Agreed by most I suppose is that there is no way we could have a free-for-all on cormorants, however a lot of fuss is being made over how should they be controlled. Science is the all encompassing rule of how research is conducted and results are processed in biology-pretty straightforward.  Think about the time that realistically may go into this process (in an academic realm):  6 months-1year: Researcher(s) comes up with a proposal for a study (cormorants), seeks approval and funding before even starting. 5 years(ballpark): Researcher(s) conduct fieldwork i.e. tracking, capturing, observations, and data collection/calculations. 6 months- Researcher(s) compile results, compare, contrast and make generalizations, suggestions and proposed control method. 1-11/2 years-Review process, final report sent to other various experts in the field to approve of the findings and so on.  7-10 year process right there...again I cannot wait for the day (if it may ever come) where I can blast every cormorant that comes within 50 yards of my duck blind, but we can't go saying they're not doing anything. When the reps from the Ministry say ""we're working on it"", well they are. Its a drawn out process that takes longer than we'd hope, but hopefully the work being done (I am by no means an expert on the matter) will result in some positive solutions for the issue and right decisions."

Sinker and myself have been hunters and fishermen for a very long time....we have actually experienced the ups and downs of wildlife in our rivers, lakes and hunting areas...not read about them in books. We can recognize a threat or a down turn WAY before our so called government ""experts"" acknowledge the problem.....I have seen crappie populations CRASH in my favorite lake all while the DEC said nothing is wrong...then at the same lake a few years later I witnessed the walleye population crash all while the DEC said the fishermen are not fishing the lake properly....LOL....guess what...we now have strict size and bag limits on both those species...something the sportsmen were BEGGING for all while the DEC was in denial.  For those who want to wait for your MNR to compile a crap load of data (see lots of money for lots of government jobs) on the cormorant invasion think how effective our two governments have been in preventing/controlling all the invasion species that are now in our waterways (see zebra mussels and gobies for small example). Now we are being threatened by Asian Carp invading our Great Lakes....should we just let it happen and study it until I'm dead....I think not...I hope not.  Money talks and Bull walks....Tree Hugging groups have tons of money to spend on the protection of the Great Cormorant and I'm sure they are in the back pockets of MANY of our government officials....if you don't realize that, then hopefully you will in time."

655890,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-12 13:07:00,0,"not sure what ""real"" experience is, but to me it sounds like you have observed a fisheries decline in your lifetime.  i don't doubt that for a minute.  what i doubt is that the cormorant is the sole or primary contributing factor in this decline.  when science determines a cull or season is required, i'll be right there with you with my wingmaster.  until then, i'm sticking with the scientific community.  nothing personal, but they are the real experts.    they are good people and they believe in what they do.  the only thing that troubles me is that having faith in the scientific community makes me the ""know it all"".  meanwhile, the people claiming to know better than the experts aren't given the same tag."
655901,GYPSY400,2012-01-12 14:15:00,191,"I believe I'm the gentleman in which the OP was referring to when he started this topic.. Up here in Northern Ontario and also Manitoulin Island the cormerant issue has become quite an epidemic. 10 years ago I didn't even know what a cormerant was, now they are everywhere.. Since they have arrived, fishing has depleted significantly -faster than any environmental issue could have wiped them out.. On my own lake in which I live on, the sightings of the birds pretty much directly coincides with the lack of fish caught.. In the winter of 05-06 perch fishing was amazing, you could catch a perch before your lure hits bottom, if your line was in the water for more than 5 minutes without a fish it because your minnow was gone.. This was like this all day, everyday..  ( now that doesn't mean I kept every fish I caught) Now fast forward to 2011... Fishing isn't even worth going out for, you really have to try all day to catch enough for a meal for one.  Please explain to me how the fishery could decline so rapidly - and NO, there aren't that many fisherman on the lake - maybe 15 - 20 huts total.  Also on Manitoulin island on lake wolesly.. Cormerants are feeding on the farmed rainbow trout and the native perch.. The MNR Has granted the rainbow trout farmer permission to shoot the birds so he can protect his investment.. But why do the perch have to change their spawning habits??  Perch on Lake Wolesly do NOT spawn in shallow water like they do in other lakes, instead they spawn deep, most likely under the rainbow farm nets... Why? To hide away from the cormerants!!  Please explain to me why a species has to change its spawning habits on one specific body of water in order to survive? And whoever stated that a cormerant eats 1lb of fish a day, I believe it's a lot more than that.  Or there's a lot of birds that go unnoticed because they are wiping out small lakes up here in a matter of years, not generations like sport fishing would. So I for one believe the cormerant issue needs taking care of NOW before it's too late, because things are declining Fast!!  For all of those who are pro-cormerant and feel I'm misinformed - flame away at me..  But before you do - come live in my region and see for yourself."

655789,Cookslav,2012-01-12 01:31:00,1457,"Well...hear is my non expert rant LOL!  Its a Bird not known to be native to southern Ontario, but its here non the less Its a bird widely suspected to be adversely effecting the fish populations. There are NO scientific studies that prove they are adversly effecting the fish population outside of any Natural occurance but their are documented studies of vegetation damage. There are also NO scientifc studies that prove a cull would be effective OR ineffective, but there are documented culls that so far....appear to have been effective in single locations(as Lew pointed out)  All I know is this, This is a bird that is not native to the area whose population is quite obviously on the rise. This same bird is known to eat about one pound of fish per day sometimes less...sometimes more. So it is common sense to assume this Bird IS effecting the fishery on some level currently.  In small scale culling appears to have worked with out any adverse effects. I know personally that there was a cull on Lake Opeongo Algonquin park in 2008 that did well...so far Basically put...there is even less evidence suggesting that culls are harmefull or ineffective then there is supporting a cull.  There fore, In my completely unproffessional opinion we should open them up to hunters for a few years and measure the success. There is certainly no more harm in that then sitting on our behinds doing what we are right now.  The ONLY ""potential"" negetive is if the Cull doesn't work and the population rebounds stronger.... In which case we've simply sped the proccess up and correct me if I'm wrong but the anti's in this case are suggesting we allow the population to overpopulate, and let nature takes its course(disease etc..)  Either way we end up at the same out come, so why not indulge in a little sport and give her a good 'ol college try?"

655811,Sharkbait22,2012-01-12 02:05:00,297,"Not taking side on this. Science can help make informed decisions, understand trade-offs, risks, and should point to uncertainties in understanding. Socio economic and political factors weigh in heavily too.  My understanding is that the birds fly far and wide such that seeing many birds in one area doesn’t mean they are always there.  Huron birds are Quinte birds are Kawartha birds – they get around. So understanding abundance is tricky. I’ve also read that we have helped the birds in ways such as pollution control but also by fishing out large predatory fish. In doing so smaller fish are more abundant for them to eat. I know one thing, don’t release dazed fish near a cormorant or it will be gone.  Get them recovered well and if possible get away from the bird."
655813,Spouph,2012-01-12 02:10:00,115,"  Well funny story , I worked with the Kyuquot native tribe and Interfor logging as a hatchery, co-ordinator for a couple of years with a very simular conclusion.  Not enouph money for the effort and to many political boundries to devide.  The project was to restock the kyuquot river, for the native band paid for by the logging co to ensure the money was put to it's intended us third party was involved ie me, and no government involvement.  One day I was working in the river pulling nets gathering coho to get eggs, and a C.O officer jumps in the back of the truck making us get out of the truck he rumaged through all our gear,I was in fact fishing for Coho Salmon when there was a Ban on fishing for Coho, for all the pacific coast of B.C.  No permit were ever taken out.  I was quite sure that I was going to prison for the night, I had a 30 foot tangle net, in my truck which is what I used and had a holding pen with 16 ripe female coho in it.   I just mentioned the Cheifs name snd that was it , he took my information and I never heard from him again, he just said have a nice day.  A few years later and several provinces away I recieved a phone call from the Cheif at the time to thank me for the efforts and that all my little babeis were back but grown up the stock numbers were good (realistically I know I may of had little to some impact), but we had to go against gov regulations to make an impact.  This is the reason I started this topic, the option of a cull is a little red neck I agree, but it is along the same lines of stocking in a penny saved is a penny earned kind of logic.  There are a couple thing I learned out west.  One if you want somthing done where red tape is involved, the goverment does not interfere with the native bands, and If you see a decline or incline in stocks, somtimes you just have to do somthing.  I don't know the right answer as far as the cormerants are concerned and I do respect your opinion.  I honestly dont think our little conversation on this forum will yeild any results.  Just an interestin topic."
655815,Sinker,2012-01-12 02:26:00,8692," Why would you think we don't?   This isn't getting personal HTHM, its getting passionate.  All I know is we need a solution to the cormorant explosion before its too late. If we leave it up to the MNR, it will be too late, I will bet on that.  I don't think there is a single person who can disagree with the fact that there are a lot more of them around than there needs to be. I don't want to kill off the species, just keep them in check before we're in too deep to fix it.  I hunt geese for 4 months every year. We kill a pile of birds. The goose population still rises every year..........so whats the big deal with killing some cormorants?? Why are some people so protective of them? Is it because they don't crap in the parks, and on the docks like geese do? I don't get how anyone could/would defend them. Post up something to sway me that way, and I may agree, but until then, I say open them up to hunting. I would be willing to bet hunters couldn't kill enough of them to even make a difference. At least we could have some fun trying, and do our little part to help protect the fishery.  S."
655816,Twocoda,2012-01-12 02:28:00,4130,"problen solved!!!!!! for the people that have a hard time catching fish...catch and train a commorant to do it for you...  Cormorant fishing is a traditional fishing method in which fishermen use trained cormorants to fish in rivers. Historically, cormorant fishing has taken place in Japan and China from around 960 AD.[1] and recorded from other places throughout the world.  To control the birds, the fishermen tie a snare near the base of the bird's throat. This prevents the birds from swallowing larger fish, which are held in their throat, but the birds can swallow smaller fish. When a cormorant has caught a fish in its throat, the fisherman brings the bird back to the boat and has the bird spit the fish up. Though cormorant fishing once was a successful industry, its primary use today is to serve the tourism industry.  The types of cormorants used differ based on the location. In Gifu, Japan, the Japanese Cormorant (P. capillatus) is used; Chinese fishermen often employ Great Cormorants (P. carbo).[2] Darters (Anhinga), which are very close relatives of cormorants, are also used for this fishing technique on occasion."
655817,Sinker,2012-01-12 02:28:00,8692,Forgot to mention all the money that would be generated from cormorant licenses that would go back into the resource. Hunting them is a win/win. Whats the big fuss with killing off a few thousand?  S.
655824,Cookslav,2012-01-12 02:37:00,1457,"  I agree with you 110%...where is the harm? This is a non native species to Southern Ontario that has no known positive contributions to the fishery or the ""foreign"" ecosystems it is spreading to, it ""could"" be harmfull to our fishery, and IS harmfull to shoreline vegetation, trees etc...  If there are people willing to hunt them why not have the MNR use the opportuntiy to make a bit of cash while getting valuable data. Seriously somebody throw me bone here... If there is a down side I'm all ears.....persuade me?"

655830,Grimace,2012-01-12 02:50:00,2020," So why do you think that shooting cormorants would have any significant effect on the population if it doesn't work for geese?  If you just want to hunt them for the fun of hunting them, come out and say it but don't pretend that you are shoot them to save the fish or make the world a better place.  If you admit that it wouldn't do much to diminish the cormorant population then what is the point.  At least you eat the geese.  I just do not understand why you would want to run around the country just to shoot a bunch of ugly birds and no food to show for it, just carcasses.  I am not what you would call a 'tree hugger'.  I am not an enemy of hunting by any stretch of the imagination.  But you seem to be talking out of both sides of your mouth.  A - We have to do something before it is too late!!! and B - We won't effect them anyway so what's the harm in letting us have fun doing it?   The point you are making with example B makes example A moot.  Example A is what all the fuss is about."
655831,Sinker,2012-01-12 02:51:00,8692,"  Well, my fishing/hunting licence and my equipment is worth more than that.  You guys know much about snow geese, and the problems with them?? I hope the cormies don't get as out of hand as they are now. They've just, finally, opened a spring hunting season in Ontario for them, starting this year. I can't wait to get a crack at them too!  S."
655832,Twocoda,2012-01-12 02:53:00,4130,crows are open for hunting....i dont think anyone eats them....personally i dont eat the geese....but i love the hunt
655833,Grimace,2012-01-12 02:58:00,2020," Then let us skip point A and get right to point B then.    You guys want to hunt cormorants because you think it would be fun and sustainable and have little negative effect.  Okay then, talk about that possibility, but do not suggest that you guys want to hunt them to save the fish stocks if admittedly the hunt will have little effect on the population."
655836,Sinker,2012-01-12 03:02:00,8692," Oh boy, where to start.  The geese are a whole different animal.  The ""authorities"" let them get to the numbers they are at, before they increased limits, and lengthened seasons. Now they are kicking themselves and don't know what to do with them. They've even tried shipping them out of the city in a truck......that's laughable. They can fly for god sakes.  Start a hunting season now, and maybe, just maybe we can keep them in check. Beat around the bush getting something going, and we're going to be stuck with so many of them we won't know what to do with them and a hunting season isn't going to do jack........ kinda like the geese are now.....see what I'm getting at???  People cry the blues to protect them, but as soon as they are a problem to them personally, the tune changes.  Tell me this...what is the harm in a hunting season for cormorants as a tool for population control? Its proven to work for many, many other species of wildlife. Why are we protecting these things???  S."
655837,Cookslav,2012-01-12 03:07:00,1457," Personally I think it would have an effect...just my oppinion, but it comes as a rsult of personal experience. I've seen dramtic results in 2 area's I fish since the culls, one being Quinte, one being Algonquin park....of course thats only a personal oppinion but sometimes seeing is believing they say.  And I'd rather see us trying to thin the population and fail as opposed to waiting and doing nothing. There really is no harm in trying...worst case scenario puts us back at the drawing board and the MNR gains a new perspective.  It seems like a win/win situation to me."
655838,Twocoda,2012-01-12 03:11:00,4130,and the bonus is ....fisherman will benefit....the hatchery fish will stand a much better chance upon their release to the wild....mortality rates in house are tolerable ....to see cormorants gobbling up a winters labour isnt tolerable (sickening actually)
655628,Billy Bob,2012-01-11 17:47:00,5865, SO....where's your science of these black flying fish eating rats.... ...what good are they ?!?!?  Enquiring anglers want to know....not when it's too late....until then BANG goes the 12 gauge....  BTW the USA and Canadian governments have reacted on this problem by oiling the eggs of these flying rats....it's their way of trying to keep everyone (see tree huggers) happy without really controlling the problem. Much like closing the open window to keep out the bugs all while both doors remain wide open...
655630,hirk,2012-01-11 17:51:00,571,"Agree 100%, I personally wouldnt shoot them, its not my place to do anything. The science has shown there is a problem that requires intervention which is way there have already been actions taken by the govt. in Ontario to reduce the numbers."
655634,captpierre,2012-01-11 18:02:00,2521,"Grimace, your science argument likely doesn't work well in the real world.  Good, hard science is not easy to come by and takes lots of time.  In the face of an outbreak of disease or potentially a harmful population explosion, by the time science gets it right, and everybody in the scientific community agrees, it's too late.  Also, our decision makers have to contend with getting re-elected and therefore are sometimes reluctant to make the right decision if it makes for controversy, or might cost them votes.  So the status-quot is maintained.  Our fishery is already under significant stress due to the reduction of the tiny organisms that make up the bottom of the food chain, thanks to the invasive mussel species introduced.  I have no problem with a modest number of cormorants.  Everybody has the right to make a living.  I just struggle with a potential additional stress on the fishery being left to get out of control, while being protected by a government that has seen them recover back very healthy numbers.  my two cents"
655635,manitoubass2,2012-01-11 18:05:00,11391," I agree, you have to let science dictate if it's actually an issue or not.  But science pretty much ends there, it's the organizations that the science is presented to that have to do something (or nothing) and that's where the problems arise.   "

655647,mpt,2012-01-11 18:28:00,158,I'm concerned about these birds my self. All the Fish and Wildlife types say they don't even make a dent in fish populations but they are trying to reduce their numbers in northern Michigan with nest oiling and more severe measures and fish populations are making a comeback. A cormorant eats at least a pound of fish per day. This doesn't seem like much but they can only eat smaller fish which reduces the total numbers of a fish population quickly and effects of reproduction may not be noticed for years and then it's too late. I wrote this last year. http://drdownriveroutdoors.blogspot.com/2011/04/cormorants.html The following month after I was told the  birds in the Detroit River were only juveniles and weren't mating I posted this(middle of article) http://drdownriveroutdoors.blogspot.com/2011/05/river-trip.html I was urging people to report sightings of these birds which we were urged to do as part of the Downriver Walleye Federation but the same person that told me there was no mating in the area also told me the reports weren't compiled or followed up on so don't waste your time. We're told there's only about 20K mating pairs in Michigan but I think that number is very low.
655650,Grimace,2012-01-11 18:43:00,2020," I don't mean in any way to be disrespectful but I must ask.  You think that the scientists are mistaken and there are more than 20 000 mating pairs in Michigan, correct?   What data are you basing your position on?  What do you feel are the flaws in their data collection techniques that are leading them to this false conclusion?  What way do you claim your data collection to be more accurate than theirs?"
655652,Grimace,2012-01-11 18:59:00,2020,"Don't get me wrong. I hate the bloody things.  All I am trying to say is before anyone orders or agrees to the systematic destruction of a species of animal in any region, the science has to be correct."

655756,Twocoda,2012-01-12 00:10:00,4130,"Cormorant Recipe  Having shot your cormorant, hold it well away from you as you carry it home; these birds are exceedingly verminous and the lice are said to be not entirely host-specific. Hang up by the feet with a piece of wire, soak in petrol and set on fire. This treatment both removes most of the feathers and kills the lice.  When the smoke has cleared away, take the cormorant down and cut off the beak. Send this to the local Conservancy Board who, if you are in the right area, will give you 3/6d or sometimes 5/- for it. Bury the carcase, preferably in a light sandy soil, and leave it there for a fortnight. This is said to improve the flavour by removing, in part at least, the taste of rotting fish.  Dig up and skin and draw the bird. Place in a strong salt and water solution and soak for 48 hours. Remove, dry, stuff with whole, unpeeled onions: the onion skins are supposed to bleach the meat to a small extent, so that it is very dark brown instead of being entirely black.  Simmer gently in seawater, to which two tablespoons of chloride of lime have been added, for six hours. This has a further tenderising effect. Take out of the water and allow to dry, meanwhile mixing up a stiff paste of methylated spirit and curry powder.  Spread this mixture liberally over the breast of the bird.  Finally roast in a very hot oven for three hours.  The result is unbelievable.  Throw it away. Not even a starving vulture would eat it. Why would you let your dog?"

655768,Spouph,2012-01-12 00:39:00,115," I absolutly agree with you.  There seems to be a few people suggesting let nature take it's course, but the subsequent concequence on us as fisherman is huge.  Selfish as a fisherman, but I have valunteered my time to hatcheries, spent time restocking rivers in B.C with Coho when numbers are down, and given money to groups to help fisheries.  I give more than I take....I do in fact take alot and enjoy the afterall I am a part of the food chain, but hopfully as a species, we arent so stupid as to eat all of our food, with no plans for the future get sick and die.  The one thing that you said that may be overlooked is the transfer of disease, from one lake to another...VHS anyone, the sad truth is that that comment is probally void due to the fact that the fish population is so low, that the disease wont transfer through low density.  Stupid birds,  aswesome creatures actually."

655775,Spouph,2012-01-12 00:56:00,115,"  My two cents on this is that goby's are invasive, and when they first appeared years sgo they were not reconised as a food fish for native species such as bass and walleye, subsequently, there population exploded.  there was a huge panic.  Since that has occoured the bass have reconised goby as a food source, and perch and other native species are on the rise.  Goby plastic baits are now quite popular on lake erie.  Saying that I have yet to see any benifit from the cormerants, years ago I could see golbies as a potitntial food sorce, but I don't see the birds benifit.  I am educated with a scientific background, and practial feild experience in fisheries and wildlife... I ask the questions as a sort of research.  saying that my opinion is simular to yours."

655565,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-01-11 13:18:00,0,cormorants do eat fish but we are the only ones who put fish stocks at risk.  they do make a convenient scapegoat for finger pointers though don't they?
655566,Sinker,2012-01-11 13:21:00,8692," I only shoot if I can get more than one with one shot  I know this guy who has a cormorant band....he found it dead on a beach   Poor little bird. We're not sure what happened to it. Must have choked on a baby walleye or something  I don't think there is a C.O out there who would lay a charge for shooting one. It would take some bleeding heart, P3TA freak to cause a ruckus in order for anyone to get charged.  In all honesty, there sure are a lot of them. This year while duck hunting we saw literally tens of thousands. I'd take the boat thru a flock of 1000 of them just to get them moving.(right in front of cliffs house too!!) Just think of all the fish 1000 of them will eat in a day, a week, a month ....a year. Its incredible. I've witnessed them eating walleye, perch and crappies in the kawartha lakes. Just think what 1000 of them will do!! 10 years ago, I didn't even know they existed. Just wait another 10 and see how many there are!!  I think they will eat themselves out of food, start to starve, and then we will have to re stock our lakes. By the time anything gets done about it, we will have no fish to catch, and an infestation of sick, dying birds to deal with. I wonder how much disease they carry with them? I have this funny feeling some of our invasive species, and fish virus's are carried around by them as well.  Just thin them out a bit now, and it will save us a lot of work down the road. I'm not saying kill them all, but keep them in check. Look at the numbers of canada geese we have....and there are plenty of opportunities to hunt them, as well as annual egg oiling....but the population still rises every year.  It will be the same as everything else with the MNR. Too little, too late. By the time anything gets done, there will be no fish left, and millions of cormorants to feed. Whats more important, the fishery in ontario, or some cormorants? The answer is a simple one in my eyes.  S."
655567,lew,2012-01-11 13:32:00,12766,We used to do alot of fishing around an island in Bay Of Quinte just north of the ferry. Eventually the cormorants discovered it and took up residence on the end of the island and within 2 years everything was white with their excrement and all the trees they used appeared dead.  A few years back there was a cull in the area and if I recall correctly they eliminated 6000 birds.  There were no longer ant birds on the island and the trees regained their foliage and to see them today you'd never know there was any sort of problem.  Just thought some may find that interesting.
655568,Billy Bob,2012-01-11 13:34:00,5865,"Sinker is RIGHT.......by the time the USA and or Canadian governments do anything it will be too late....just look at the snow geese problem....our government is just STARTING to address the situation....but a lot of damage has already been done to breeding grounds of other waterfowl.  I have never seen our government ""ACT"" to something that needs to be done, but rather ""REACT"" to something that should of been done years ago.  Now where did I put that cormorant shotgun of mine.....  Oh, here it is....."

655577,Grimace,2012-01-11 14:16:00,2020,"Pitchforks, torches, blind ignorance.  So what do we have here?  People running around shooting birds that are protected because it is perceived by many to be a population explosion based on nothing more than casual observation?  If the pesticides from OUR population explosion killed a great many of these birds before any of our lifetimes and they are now making a comeback because of a positive change in OUR policies then we should probably not make judgements in their numbers based on a sample of 10-30 year fishing experience.  There sure does seem to be alot more of them now than 15 years ago but then again I was not around in the year 1900 to see how many there use to be.  Is the complaint here that they eat too much fish mass? If the fish weren't there to eat they couldn't eat them.  Is the complaint that they crap on trees?  Yes, it is pretty unsightly.   I guess my point is that unless you have scientific evidence you should put your gun down and stick to whatever you do for a living."
655579,mike rousseau,2012-01-11 14:23:00,4661,Like I said earlier...  The government is paying people to help control their numbers...

655581,cram,2012-01-11 14:24:00,1733,"Considered native here, but also expanding their range considerably beyond where they were historically. They're a problem that'll probably balance out, but if not we have a real mess on our hands."
655583,Dave Bailey,2012-01-11 14:45:00,1641," Well said. Instead of blaming cormorants for just doing what comes naturally, let's try to find out WHY their numbers have rapidly increased in the past few decades. No species exists in isolation,something has changed in the environment that has allowed them to flourish. What if we found out that they are pigging out on, and thereby controlling, round goby populations. Would we be so eager to kill them then?  With all the technological advances in fishing gear sport fisherman have it better today than we have ever had it in history. We complain because cormorants eat fish? Here's a shock for you - FISH EAT FISH! Guess we should control all predatory fish species too, which is... um... oh, all of them. I don't think there are any vegetarian species in Ontario, but I am willing to be corrected on that."

655588,Sinker,2012-01-11 15:06:00,8692,"If fish populations were rising as fast as the cormorant population, I'd have no problem. Whats gonna happen when we run out of fish?? We all suffer, not only cormorants.  I have no doubt they're eating gobies in some lakes, but around here, we don't have them, so I'd say they're feeding on sportfish primarily. They will probably drop a few gobie eggs in the kawartha's though....isn't that just gonna be great!!  I have no problem with cormorants as a species, its the massive boom in thier population i have a problem with. They need a bit of help in controlling it. As long as we have lots of fish, the population will continue to rise.....do the math.  Sure, give it 10 or 15 years and let them thin themselves out, but what about our fish stocks?? We gonna let them thin out as well?? I don't think its worth it for a few dirty birds. Their negatives, by far, out weigh the positives.  I like the idea with the natives. That is a great idea IMO.

655626,Grimace,2012-01-11 17:29:00,2020,Scientific evidence should be making these decisions.  Science doesn't have an opinion.  All it has is evidence and truth.  The only concern that science has is that it is producing factual knowledge and reasonable solutions.  These decisions should not be made by arrogant and ignorant individuals with no evidence or education to decipher evidence in the particular field of discussion.  There should not be an armed uprising of the unqualified running around the countryside shooting everything they deem to be overpopulated or generally a detriment to their view of society.

655404,Spouph,2012-01-10 23:07:00,115,"I was talking to a fellow the other day about the cormerants cleaning the perch out of his lake.  It seem to me that 5 years ago I donated a little money to the federation of anglers and hunters on a phone call by them for eliminating nor reducing the cormerants.  Subsequently I recieved a call for the next 3 years asking for the same thing.  I did not give anymore and I think I asked them to stop calling.  Now my question to you all is, has anything been done to cull cormerants.  I have not heard or been paying attention, I understand that it takes a lot of money to lobby the goverment, I am just as much at fault I could of given more.   But has anything been done by anyone.  I was boating across lake Erie and there was a flock of cormorant that had to be in the thousands strong,  when I went through the center of them, some were so full, they could not fly.  From what sounds like the northern ont lake are getting hit hard as well.  I have a thought, tell me if you think this is ignorant or not.  But I think we should raise a ton of money and have the Native canadians, go on a free for all.  They have no restrictions on what they hunt.  It would eliminate all the red tape assioated with the cull, and the job would get done.  Id rather give a million dollars to a native tribe, than to a politician, atleast something would get accomplished. let me know what you think.  "
655411,Rod Caster,2012-01-10 23:33:00,5784,"If the natives agreed to it, then sure, I'm all for it too. We cull geese all over the place for the reason of overpopulation...why not cormorants if they are indeed a problem."

I'm sure they eat a lot of perch and other panfish too, but I have to admit I love the loons being there.  They are native.  The cormorants aren't.  Opening a hunting season would certainly help.  Politically tricky."

There is no reason to cull them nature will run its course sure it will take 5 or 10 years but if we don't then the populations will never become stable and we will always have this problem.
