So cool I had to talk about it. Now can you guys tell me what are some of the cool aps for fishing or to just waist time lol. I love the fact I can get OFC on here.

Brought me right to where I dropped my phone in the bush, 2 hours before our first snowfall.  http://www.apple.com/iphone/built-in-apps/find-my-iphone.html"

656595,Joey,2012-01-14 21:09:00,9122,Airport Mania is my favorite.  I have alot of wind ones for the big lakes and Starmappro is cool too.
656689,GYPSY400,2012-01-15 03:09:00,191,"My iPhone is surgically attached to my hand!! I use a lot of the GPS apps ( motion X) and I-Fish Ontario is pretty good for finding out what kind of fish is in what lake.  Im also a Kijiji wh_re... Can't afford anything, but can't help but look..  Question:  How is the navionics app for inland lakes in Ontario ?? I was thinking of getting it, but the coverage map looks like my area is not documented."
656706,Handlebarz,2012-01-15 03:43:00,3790,The flash light was the first one I got. I was driving the wife nuts the strobe is cool.
656776,Harrison,2012-01-15 13:46:00,2202,"Mike, if you are a guitar player check out the ""gString Free"" tuner. I use it when tuning down, works great.  Also, ""Jango"" streaming radio, use it a lot as well."

656998,Live2fish85,2012-01-16 11:17:00,1633,There is one called Ufindfish it is were people share there fishing spots and tips( not all that good in that sense) but the map can be used almost like google earth its pretty neat. Plus its free.
