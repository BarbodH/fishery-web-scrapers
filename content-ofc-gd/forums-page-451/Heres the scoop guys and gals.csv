I am finally starting a new chapter in my life in which started out with a bang:angel: Personally it felt like new years eve with good friends and many good folks . Enough of that, now for the fishing end of things. I payed our nice friend jocelyn today a visit, to pick up a few items, and some extras  After grueling over what fishfinder I want, I picked up an hds7 insight. All I can say WOW! I took another look around and thought quitely too myself ""my riggers are on their way out, they are old"" Sooooooooooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 2 new electric riggers plus a few more items:rolleyes: Why not  Anyhow, tommorow morning I will get back to what is most important in my life, my two little darling angels:)     Thanks again for everyones moral support, I appreciate it tremendously. So, fish on, rock on or what ever that turns your crank to make your day that much better   Ps I will make a formal post for the OFC funniest ice fishing photo contest, for all to submit their photos in a day or two."
