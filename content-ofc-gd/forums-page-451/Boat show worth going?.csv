656744,GYPSY400,2012-01-15 07:15:00,191," LOL.. I wish I could feel your pain!! My wife is the polar opposite!!  She's still upset about the bow mount trolling motor I put on my new Legend.. Her words: "" what do you need a motor on the front for? You already have one on the back!!"" I couldn't help but laugh!  But to get back on track.. If your a serious buyer, I would go.. It's good to see products in person as sometimes Internet pictures don't do it justice. You can also jump into a Lund, then a crestliner, then a etc. etc. without driving all over town.. Take the saleman with a grain of salt.. They'll tell you what you want to hear"
656772,skeeter99,2012-01-15 13:26:00,109,  all my buddies say that my wife is great (and she is trust me) so I am pretty lucky I cannot complain
657035,Lunkerhunter,2012-01-16 14:49:00,455,i also went on friday to the special preview night. alot of great boats to look at including some new models etc. i found it very helpful being able to check out all the outboard companies and speak with the reps to find out some answers to the questions i had. they were very helpful.  i ended up purchasing the new princecraft xpedition 170 SC. paired it up with a 115 merc 4 stroke and 9.9 pro kicker. cant wait for the spring now! hahah the guys at princecraft had some great deals and were very helpful.  i would say it is def worth the day/afternoon to look around.
657038,lew,2012-01-16 15:01:00,12766,"Congrats on the new boat, sounds like a beaut.  My bud  has had a 17' Princecraft with a 115 Evinrude for quite a few years now and he's really happy with it and has never had an issue with anything."
657042,cityfisher,2012-01-16 15:16:00,959,Sounds like the best wife ever! Dont complain!
657043,Grimace,2012-01-16 15:17:00,2020,Congrats on your new boat.   You must be thrilled.   That is a very sharp looking unit.  Get the drill out and make sure your measurements are right!
656341,ah_long,2012-01-13 18:24:00,354,"I want to ask the people who have been to past boat shows and I'm wondering if it's worth going.  I'm not looking for a new boat, I'm just looking for deals on accessories.  I'm looking for a 3 bank onboard charger, new batteries, and possibly some other boating accessories  I'm thinking whether I should go to this one AND the boat and fishing show in feb or just go to the boat and fishing show"
656342,Skipper D,2012-01-13 18:28:00,1970,YES ! .......... I need some new swivle seats for my project ....lol.  I hope there are deals .
656351,kickingfrog,2012-01-13 18:59:00,8333,For what it's worth there is a groupon for mid week passes to the boat show.
656355,lew,2012-01-13 19:19:00,12766,"Even if you don't find any bargains at the Boatshow it's still a great way to spend an afternoon. Always lotsa good stuff to look at and  see what's new on the market.  Just be careful though, cause if you lose your willpower it can become a VERY expensive day."
656359,ah_long,2012-01-13 19:28:00,354,the groupon is only for two...  but do u guys know if there are better deals for this show or the boat and fishing show?
656361,troutologist,2012-01-13 19:49:00,951,I'm curious to see the new 1775 and 1875 Pro V's. Haven't had a first hand look at them yet.   I look forward to the boat show in Wpg each year.
656374,Tom McCutcheon,2012-01-13 20:30:00,627,"I have always found it a great place to look at and compare similar products from different manufacturers. If you know in advance the retail prices, then you know if there are deals to be had or not at the show. I haven't missed a show in probably 25 years."
656421,wormdunker,2012-01-13 22:41:00,1711,"Great way to spend a day looking at all the toyz! Factor in all the costs, U could have 1 new free battery.  Gas expense, admission, parking (outrageous), lunch, snacks, pop (X 2 if your wife accompanies U).  I prefer to deal with the local guy, he'll be there when I have a question or a problem.  Alot of  the vendors at these shows don't even have a store front.  They just travel from one trade show to the next with their inventory. This doesn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling."
656442,Skipper D,2012-01-14 00:56:00,1970,"If theres three or four guys from the Barrie area that would like to go down , i can do the driving , i have the four door King cab  , the fuel and the ride are on me ,  just send a PM to set some thing up"
656490,Radnine,2012-01-14 04:33:00,1538,"  Um, DUH! If you don't go to the boat show you are missing out on an opportunity to answer many questions (first hand) that you would otherwise have to rely on random people whom you really don't know (from forums for instance) to answer. Spend the money, go to the show! Jim"
656526,woodenboater,2012-01-14 14:53:00,2277,"Are all the fishing boats usually clustered in one part of the centre or will I need to put on the walking shoes ?  and on the off chance I win the lottery this weekend and buy a boat there (show special only for example), I presume I've got till the end of the show to haul it away ? "
656529,skeeter99,2012-01-14 15:02:00,109,"  nope  I have bought 2 bass boats at the toronto show, each time I picked it up in april (I requested that) and usually they will send back to there shop to do pdi and licensing and u can pick up a week or so after the boat show"
656540,lew,2012-01-14 15:56:00,12766," I also bought my current boat at the show on the agreement the dealer store it for me at his place for the winter and have it all rigged & ready when I picked it up in May, which they did."
656547,woodenboater,2012-01-14 16:39:00,2277,"Thanks for the info Skeeter and Lew !  C'mon 6/49, need a new boat for 2012"
656551,BillM,2012-01-14 17:08:00,17367,Might check it out for some goodies for the Lund.
656552,Tybo,2012-01-14 17:13:00,1373,"Trade show are not what they use to be. With computerized billing and inventory it's harder too push product out the back door. Their is also a very high over head at shows now also. Alot of vendors need to higher temp sales staff for the show also longer travel or stay in motels. This is all monies that the vendors has to recover. 30 years ago a trade show was a smorgasbord of deals,Not so much now."
656561,Tybo,2012-01-14 18:04:00,1373, By any chance are you a sales man.Because they will say anything to make a deal.So how are your question being answered first hand. Myself would take the word of a product user  or a tech over the word of a salesman.
656568,Radnine,2012-01-14 19:06:00,1538," I am not a salesman, but I do play one on TV! I just love the boat show, even when I am not looking for anything. I love it from the minute I walk in and think that for straight value for your state of mind, it is worth the trip. But I think that it is invaluable for buying boats or accessories. In terms of being able to sit in a boat, making direct comparisons, or holding a paddle in your hand, it can't be beat. You can ask ""Lowrance or Humminbird or Garvin?"" Or you can go and demo all three. Jim"
656579,craigdritchie,2012-01-14 19:59:00,1586," Hard to answer that since I have no idea what deals you might find at another show that won't happen for another month. But I would expect most of the deals to be similar, as they have been in the past.  I walked through the Toronto Boat Show Friday Nnight during the charity preview evening. I didn't look at the accessories so much as aluminum fishing boats .... there are a LOT of nice aluminums to drool over.  Since it's not exactly an expensive day, I'd say it's worth going, especially if you're a serious buyer."
656580,skeeter99,2012-01-14 20:00:00,109,"  Dont go !!!!!!!!!!!   it is a horrible place , my wife forced me to buy new bass boast on 2 ocassions  1st time  she hoped up on the bicycle seat of the purple skeeter and said ""my purple rhinestone bikini will match""	.......... 1 hour later I own it  second time  she layed on the rear casting deck and gave me the look ......  1 and a half later I own it   so either dont go or dont bring your wife, she is the worst influence encouraging me to buy all the new boats and electronics, it is horrible every time we go to bass pro or a tackle shop she makes me buy on average $300 bucks worth of stuff"
656591,Tom McCutcheon,2012-01-14 20:55:00,627,Braggin or complainin
656594,ah_long,2012-01-14 21:06:00,354,not looking to buy a new boat as I just got one.. just wanna figure out how to score the best deals on batteries and on board chargers..  I'll probably go on a weekday and see
656600,woodenboater,2012-01-14 21:41:00,2277," now just saying , usually with my buds I would say 'pics or it's made up'   j/k  and btw, I think most  guys here would kill to have a wife like yours...2 boats @ 2 shows ? dayum !  if my wife was at the show and saw I lusted for a boat that cost around + $20k  she'd be laughing all the way to the exit "
656603,Grimace,2012-01-14 22:02:00,2020,All the boats under one roof.   You can jump in and out of them and do a real good job of comparing them.  It's better than driving all over the country and trying to remember how the boat you were in the other week compares with the one you are in now.   That's what I liked about being a buyer at the boat show.   Plus when I bought new they had done good deals.  I picked up my boat for 28 and it would of been 32 outside the show.  I have not seen very many good deals the last few years though.  Now I just go for the fun of it.   Its cheaper than going to the movies.  Lol.
656605,hirk,2012-01-14 22:44:00,571," If you just want batteries and a charger dont waste your time. I guarantee there wont likely be either there to buy and if there was they wouldnt be any cheaper than if you went into any dealer and bought them in fact you would likely get a better price from a dealer that sold both as a ""package""."
