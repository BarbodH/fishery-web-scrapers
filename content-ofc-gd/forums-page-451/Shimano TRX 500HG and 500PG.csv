There is free shipping and a $50.00 discount available on orders with an after discount net of $500.00, but you have to ask for it.  American Legacy Tackle Link   Now Taking Orders On The Shimano TranX EXTREME BAD ASS Low Profile Reel.........    You can't hardly go to any credible fishing blog or tackle test web site that isn't all abuzz about this truly ""Bad Ass"" Low Profile ""Big Fish"" Reel called the Shimano TranX. If you're a musky fisherman or fish for other big, bad fish such as stripers, wahoo, steelhead, salmon, or any variety of other bad fish and have always wished you could find a more comfortable low profile casting reel then this, my friends, is your reel!    These reels are made tough as nails and will out perform many of the ""round reels"" so common (and at times cumbersome and uncomfortable) today. They are available in 6.6:1 and a 4.6:1 retrieve ratio and weigh in at about 20 oz., so don't think of them as dainty or something you'll use in Uncle Norm's farm pond. These guys are for fish with attitudes. Big fish that don't want to be caught!    Shimano TranX reels have a revolutionary design and shape that provides the comfort of low profile with the capacity of a conventional reel. Shimano TranX is offered in high gear (HG) and power gear (PG) models to cover a wide range of applications. Here are the details per Shimano:    X-Ship provides an extra smooth retrieve with superior durability; HEG - a larger drive gear and pinion gear increase cranking efficiency; SF - Superfree Bearing supported Pinion Gear eliminates friction with spool shaft for better freespool; E.I. Surface treatment on the spool protects against corrosion from saltwater soaked braided line; S A-RB coating protects bearings from rust in saltwater use; Super Stopper eliminates handle back play; VBS Brake System effectively reacts to spool rotation speed to provide ideal brake force at all times during cast; Dartainium II Drag Washer provides incredibly smooth drag performance with durability; and an Ergonomic Power Handle for better leverage.    There are two models:    TRX500HG has a 6.6:1 retrieve ratio, 43 in. line retrieve per crank, 25 lb Max Drag, 7 S-ARB Bearings and 1 Roller Bearing, 30/160 - 40/120 - 50/100 mono line capacity, 50/420 - 65/270 - 80/210 Power Pro braid line capacity. Price is $499.99    TRX500PG has a 4.6:1 retrieve ratio, 30 in. line retrieve per crank, 25 lb Max Drag, 7 S-ARB Bearings and 1 Roller Bearing, 30/160 - 40/120 - 50/100 mono line capacity, 50/420 - 65/270 - 80/210 Power Pro braid line capacity. We're guessing you could probably winch you car out of a ditch with this baby! Price is $499.99    Now we do not have these new reels in stock yet, but we have them listed on our web site where you can order them to make sure you get some of the very first reels that arrive which should be early March 2012. Pre-release buzz is that the Shimano TranX will be THE HOT REEL for 2012, so if you really want one of these bad boys order now to make sure you don't have to wait until Fall to get one. Do-It-Now.....please!"
