656134,Grimace,2012-01-13 01:46:00,2020, In a very hard core case of espionage when Colonal Harland Sanders was at gun point he was told to release his secret recipe.  With eyes full of tears and a soul emptied of self respect he gave in and uttered those three things.  They didn't believe him.  RIP Harland.
