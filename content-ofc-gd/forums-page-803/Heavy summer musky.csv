371127,fishingisliving,2009-08-10 03:30:00,170,"A quick report of my buddy Rob's memorable evening of fishing.  After spending a couple hours fishing the milk run, Rob had originally planned to fish with his sister and brother in law in hopes to catch them a big one! Unfortunately sometimes plans do not always work out, that’s life! Rob was by himself with his trusty camera enjoying a nice evening of calm winds warm weather and sunny skies. He managed to hook a small musky which he just released by the boat without taking any pictures (I guess after a few years the little ones do not thrill us anymore? Yeah we are spoiled!).  Sometimes the little fish remind us to pay attention to what we are doing and although we are used to doing something it does not mean we should take things for granted. These fish are strong, feisty and often times are uncooperative. It is always important to remain focused when it’s time to manipulate one, or you just might lose it before you can take any pictures of it!  In fact the second musky of the evening was not a giant, but Rob was reminded to stay focused and always have a strong grip on the fish and to never let go. The fish kicked just as it was being pulled out of the net when Rob’s hand let go and the fish fell right in the water. What if that had been a giant?? No pictures, no witnesses, gone! You did not lose the fish during the fight, you netted it, unhooked it and are ready for a picture this is the easy part right? Yes, but don’t be fooled things can still go very wrong!  Luckily, Rob was given another chance. Robs fishing rod bent violently and the drag screamed, and pulled out 60ft of line in seconds. This was not an average fish, this was not a lazy fish, this was an all star MVP. Usually big fish tend to stay down deep and give a bunch of head shakes, this fish was splashing at the surface like smaller ones tend to do, yet when it gave a head shake, Rob felt them all the way to his guts! When the fish showed itself, Rob was in awe: “ WOW!” Thankfully the beast was cooperative at boat side and was easily put in the net.  ...  "

Kudos to your buddy on the great catch and release of a fish of a lifetime. That fish must be 57-58 inches long, i guess."
371224,darsky,2009-08-10 14:52:00,586,"A true giant and mid summer no less.57-58 seems about right and I am guessing 47-49 lbs,probably 53-55 lbs in Nov."
