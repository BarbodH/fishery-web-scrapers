371684,Oktravis,2009-08-11 18:23:00,62,"my buddy and i (OFC member jonaton) went up to cooks bay after the storm in the morning. hoping for  a couple of hours of fishing before the afternoon storm.  we fished for an hour Jon cough a little bass (pic is still on my camera.) then it happened i tripped over my tackle box and got hooks caught in my shoe and all over so i picked up my lures and stuff and decided i would get a drink from the cooler. i turned around and i was one rod short i looked around and no sign of it. we turned the boat around and started looking in the water.after a half an hour with no luck i gave up.       i don't have a trolling motor so we were just drifting when it went in.i have no idea where it went in to the water. now somewhere in the water is a 7 ft HM shimano clarus with a shimano cruxis reel.it was my favorite rod.i guess off to lebaron for a new one I'm still in disbelieve that its gone, live and learn i guess  Travis"
