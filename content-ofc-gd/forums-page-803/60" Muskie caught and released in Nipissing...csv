372018,Rich Clemens,2009-08-12 16:12:00,3131,Just gimme one half that size and I'd be a happy man. Aw heck ... Just gimme one of those.
372188,Jonny,2009-08-13 00:57:00,1380,"Maybe he didn't know how to hold the fish but he did let it go, so kudos to him. I would wager that if the fish had gone belly-up he would have retrieved it."
371821,Muskieman,2009-08-12 00:50:00,2472,http://photos.nugget.ca/mycapture/enlarge....ategoryID=16615   Let it live another day..........  Now who will be the first ...?   RFS 
371822,richyb,2009-08-12 00:53:00,774,Sweet on a spinning rod to boot !!!!  I guess there is no need for the 100lb line and boat wenches on a telephone pole for a rod to reel in a monster.  Sweet fish
371830,Greencoachdog,2009-08-12 01:00:00,8163,Oh hell yeah!!!... I catch them in 'Bama all the time!!!  ... but me and Roy feel the same way...   ... y'all just aint worthy of a report!
371836,curlrap,2009-08-12 01:14:00,58,Pretty sure the article said he caught it while fishing bass and pike in 4 feet of water.
371843,bow slayer,2009-08-12 01:23:00,1074,nice fish..........am I the only that has a problem with the way he is handling this fish?
371847,Musky or Specks,2009-08-12 01:26:00,2710,No Ive got a problem with it as well but the guy has probably never musky fished so you gotta forgive it. Now if he was a musky fisherman I would be first in line calling for a public stoning
371850,Greencoachdog,2009-08-12 01:26:00,8163,  What???... I don't see a gaff!!!    Maybe y'all would prefer the wet index finger inserted into the anal vent hold???
371851,ctdd2006,2009-08-12 01:31:00,531,"  I love fishing for musky and always respect the fishery....but shoot me if I become a ""musky firsherman""!  Congrats to he who captured the beast!  Remember all......pictures don't always tell the whole story!"
371855,HTHM,2009-08-12 01:33:00,4082,Gasp! A VERTICAL hold!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
371856,highdrifter,2009-08-12 01:34:00,2534,Another mammoth released...  Looks like we may have a trend developing here.  Looking good!!  Thanks bud! HD
371857,Muskieman,2009-08-12 01:38:00,2472,  Happens every time.....
371903,ciceri,2009-08-12 03:19:00,535,"I can forgive him for holding it like that, you can tell he's not a musky fisherman by the boat he's in."
371906,Joey,2009-08-12 03:25:00,9122,He just didn't want to get his shirt slimey  Looks like he's having a heck of a time just hoisting it.  What a beauty.  Joey
371910,mistaredone,2009-08-12 03:42:00,913,Looking at that guys gear 7 foot med action rod probably 20lbs test tops id really like to hear the story of how he landed that fish.  Im sure it didnt fit in his little bucket nut.  Crazy fish.  Hope its still swimming.
371914,John Bacon,2009-08-12 03:49:00,3277," Having a ""wench"" on the boat can be nice sometimes..."
371916,TJQ,2009-08-12 04:12:00,7806, Ditto....  but not all are enlightened..  some slack in necessary.
371917,GBW,2009-08-12 04:12:00,8460,"JEBUS!!!!!!!!!!!  Nice fish for sure no matter what gear he was using! PS, I just want one no matter the size..."
371923,jediangler,2009-08-12 05:00:00,1923,"He had noble intentions, and released the fish. Definitely a fish of a lifetime."
371931,musky_man,2009-08-12 07:32:00,159,"Rich,  Yes there is a need.  The point of heavy tackle is so you can get the fish in when it still has some life in it.  If you play a fish that size until it is completely spent, in warmer (July) waters, then hold it vertically for several pictures, then think that fish has a high chance for recovery when you release it, your dreaming.  It is (was?) a beautiful fish ... lets hope that with all the errors that fellow made, the fish made it too.  Cheers.      "
371977,Joey,2009-08-12 13:35:00,9122,"Here's the full article, and some pretty nasty comments after.  North Bay Nugget Article"
371984,fishingisliving,2009-08-12 14:05:00,170,"Person is just not that experienced in holding fish like that, not only is the hold harmful for the fish, but it's not the most flattering shot of the fish either.  but 60 inches.. that's loooong, would of loved to see a side shot to get a look at the belly and the colors."
371992,ehg,2009-08-12 14:29:00,2666,"I didn't think there was huge musky in Nipissing, the last few years have seen many caught. That is good.  Obviously this fish was caught incidentally by a non musky fisherperson, so he was lucky. 20 years ago that fish would have been on shore dead. Seems like landing and releasing edumacation is trickling into the general public."
371993,capt_hooked,2009-08-12 14:35:00,212,"GCD... I like you idea on the holding technique... you're a funny guy....!   ..  Nipissing fish are big.... I've personally have seen two, over the years, that would make that baby look somewhat small...  just so you know... they can get even bigger...!  What a beautiful fish though... !  And good for the guy for releasing it.   But now... if you were to catch a world record... would you release it....?????? As a camp owner (to help guarantee my kids' college funds) I would be very tempted to keep it and mount that baby...  On the other hand as just some joe fishing ... I'd probably let her go...?  btw... if you really feel sorry to the poor musky.... my suggestion is don't fish for them...! Leave them alone... !  "
371999,F_ast,2009-08-12 14:54:00,154,"I would release it.  The only way to guarrentee there will be trophic fish four the generations is to always put them back.  If every trophic that was caught was kept, all you would ever see who be hammer handles.  There is something special about slipping a giant fish back into the water and watching it disapear.  As for mounting, there are more than enough companies out there that can generate replicas without needing the fish.  The ministry unfortunitely will not grant it to be a new world record without the fish though unfortunitely... if they did, the new world record would have been caught by Dale MacNair last November 28 of of the St.Lawrance near Gananoque Ontario.   Pretty sure it was a 57x33.  "
372005,oates,2009-08-12 15:39:00,151,"going up there next week, will try to get it for you guys."
