A few pan sized smallies.   Plus a few WGSF. Dropped off some fishing gear for the rehab department. Apparently my daughter is going to teach others the basics of fishing. Kind of funny cause 2 weeks ago she still had me tying on all her tackle    I'm hoping I'll get a few pics of these sessions to share.
