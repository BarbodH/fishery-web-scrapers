371755,myst,2009-08-11 22:16:00,57,"Hi, a group of 6 of us want to do a last minute 3 or 5 night stay at a fairly remote lodge not more than 6-7 hours from Ottawa. We want to go for the nights of August 25-27ish.  We are after big pike, bass, walleye, whatever we can catch we just want to have a great time! We haven't had much success on Nipissing, we'd like to try something new this year.  I tried a few places on Lady Evelyn Lake, I'm waiting to hear back from them but they might be booked solid.  Does anyone have other suggestions? Thanks in advance!!!"

I really don't have any suggestions as far as where to go    maybe the French River?  Good Luck!
