She will probably spend the day rueing the fact that she saddled herself with such a creature as I, while I will be astounded that she has been able to tolerate me for so long. She is an amazing woman, as anyone who has ever met her can attest to. The worst is, business has been so slow, I can't even get a good steak for the BBQ."

My son and I came home from fishing for the day and wife says oh I sent out for a pizza, if you want I saved a couple of slices for you two. I still didn't know, then the phone rang.
