Both were caught on a 6'' dipstick worm texas rigged in about 5-7 FOW      And a couple pics of the area i was fishing    ive found the fishing here pretty tough as of late, maybe ill get lucky next weekend as well"
371557,TC1OZ,2009-08-11 12:45:00,987,Looks exactly like where we were fishing on the weekend.   Text book bass fishing area....but where the hell are all the fish?? lol
371573,Radnine,2009-08-11 13:35:00,1538, I think the problem is that the bass don't read the text book. We casted our behinds of in water that looked the same last week and came up with nothing. Jim
371592,TC1OZ,2009-08-11 14:12:00,987,  I guess this is where the phrase a bad day on the water beats a good day at work....I am currently at work living proof of that statement!
