Fishing the thick weed edge with spinnerbait, buzzbait and senko type have caught plenty for me. I actully caught my personal best this yr at the same location with white spinnerbait, 4.5lb. The best part was probably letting it go and knowing its still swimming in the lake. (Sorry no pictures)  Not sure if this is appropiate for the General Discussion section, I have a spot or two for my tomorrow's fishing trip. Anyone interested for some fishing at Rice tomorrow, let me know ASAP!   Planning to fish Rice Lake tomorrow afternoon (Thurseday Aug 13). Will be targeting Largemouth Bass in the weeds, was at the same spot on Tuesday, the fishing was pretty good. I'm driving from Toronto area, so will take the HWY 401 and exit at Cobourg. Pick up near the highway only. Chip-in for gas  I'll check my PM until 1pm Thurseday Aug 13.  Thanks"
