I have currently been using an assortment of streamers with minimal success. Any tried tested and true patterns,colours...etc that anyone would be willing to share would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,"
371874,Marko,2009-08-12 02:08:00,854,I am no fly fisherman by any means but have you tried egg imitations for big browns? I know salmon and bows will hit them i don't see a reason why browns would not.

371905,highdrifter,2009-08-12 03:22:00,2534,Fly fishing for browns lake side.  Now there's something I'd like to see!!  Have you tried alewife patterns?  A lefty's deceiver tied in white materials on a 2/0 with a bit of herl for the collar is a great fly.  Or maybe a clouser.  I'd include pics but I'm out.  This clouser looks fairly straightforward to tie.  clouser  Love to know your set-up though.  Do you cast a shooting taper?  Is a clear tip necessary?!  cheers HD
