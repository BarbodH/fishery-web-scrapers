371975,JohnF,2009-08-12 13:34:00,3494,"I'm not going to read all the replies, just offer my own opinion.  If a person does not have a high comfort level with deep water they should wear one. IOW if you can't pass some kind of basic swimming test and still want to be out in a boat, wear a pfd.  When I say high comfort level I mean something like this. It really isn't too much to expect of oneself. To get a scuba cert most or all of the agencies require a demonstration of reasonable swimming proficiency. As I recollect we had to be able to swim something like 300 yds (any stroke, no time limit), tread water for 10 or 20 minutes, and be able to remove and replace our dive gear on the bottom in 10-12' of water surfacing between the doffing and donning. This was done without fins and mask.  Perhaps a swimming test should be part of the Boater Card test. I'm joking of course.  I don't like the idea of mandating pfd use at all times. If we allow gov't to do all our thinking for us before long we'll just be drones. When do we draw the line - when the gov't mandates condoms for all single men when dating?  As several have already stated wearing a pfd should be a matter of common sense. If one can't swim adequately well or is nervous about it then wear a pfd when on the water. If the conditions are adverse (current, wind, waves, temps) then wear a pfd. If one is in a vessel that is prone to capsize (canoes & kayaks in certain conditions or fast boats being driven fast).  Wearing a pfd should be a personal decision inviting no negative commentary from others. I'll reference scuba diving again. Smart competent divers have an expression I'll paraphrase ""Anyone can thumb a dive any time, no questions asked, and no criticism allowed."" IOW if I don't feel right about a dive I can end it or cancel it and my buddy goes along with my decision like it or not. The same thinking should apply to wearing a pfd. If I want to wear one regardless of the conditions and circumstances it's my decision solely and no one else has a right to an opinion about my choice except the operator of the boat who is within their rights to insist that any or all passengers wear pfd's.

From the responses it's pretty obvious that we are for the most part responsible and use common sense, as to when and where we wear our PFD. It's important in my estimation to bring up topics like this as to ensure the community is aware of the possibility of more unnecessary government interference, and take a stance against it, if necessary. We should not all lose our freedom of choice because of a few who were reckless and shouldn't have been on the water in the first place."
372062,Jonny,2009-08-12 19:01:00,1380," Exactly.  But the regulation-happy crowd often use that ""If it only saves one life"" argument. Pretty stupid.  If we really wanted to manage all risks, we'd start by reducing the maximum speed on our highways to 60 km/h.

372119,JohnF,2009-08-12 21:46:00,3494, I agree. As a potential boat owner I really don't want to be told I must wear a pfd every minute I'm on the water and it's only by keeping it in front of the involved public that boat owners will avoid apathy/complacency setting in. There's nothing our respective levels of gov't like better (other than an easy tax grab) than unnecessary safety legislation that makes them look proactive. We're letting them get away with the HST obfuscation. That should be enuf apathy for a few years or more.  JF

372194,oates,2009-08-13 01:29:00,151,"I didn't wear a jacket before, I remember the boat getting shaky (with two guys 250LB + moving around), almost falling in - never really cared, can't swim well, probably could survive floating and swimming but 50/50 - I should try it in shallow water (like 5ft) to see if could swim 300 yards or float for 10 mins at a time to rest.  I now always wear it? Why you may ask? Because I got swept downstream whilst wading and ended up losing my rod and drowning fast before having to swim to shore in a current wearing waders which were filled with water down to the boots, I made it to shore - not a fun exp. it was so tiring it took me 10 mins to get my breath.  So I learnt from that, don't underestimate the water, unless you can swim like a fish then no worries (but what if the water temp is like 12c? can you still swim 5km?)  I like the idea like they do with bicycles, helmet is mandatory to a certain age, then optional - I think by doing this, kids will grow up with it and maybe 20-30% of them will keep doing it as adults, it will cut down some occurences and still leaves people the option, I don't think it should be treated like seatbelts because honestly, it is extremely rare unless alchohol is involved.

During 1996-2000, the same number of boaters not wearing PFDs still drowned as in the previous five years—643 victims. Most boating victims were not wearing a PFD (85% of those for whom PFD information was available). And one-third of victims did not even have a PFD in their boat (31% of deaths for which PFD information was available). Stronger measures appear needed to motivate more Canadians to wear a PFD  Almost all boating victims are male (91%). Half (48%) of all boating victims are 35 to 64 years of age. One-third (33%) of boating victims are 18 to 34 years of age.  http://www.lifesaving.ca/content/english/p...ingRepFinal.pdf  google US boating accident stats....much more US content than CDN available  bottom line is very simple.....pfd's help save lives....the push to enforce them will only get stronger  I wasn't wearing my seatbelt and I got hit with 2 points and 115 fine....but I didnt' carp about it, I knew better  so I sucked it up and I damn well wear my seatbelt every second in my car now....hit my wallet and it is effective enforcement.....so maybe someday that will end up saving my life....  somebody said this, "" It's a matter of managing risks. YOU CAN'T MANAGE THEM ALL""  that is exactly the point....but you can manage/reduce your own risks....and wearing a pfd helps reduce your risk....most boating accidents occur while the vessel is engaged in motion...aka there is a much higher risk of being ejected from your vessel on the water than in your car....in that split second before impact how many are going to grab and fasten their pfd????  everybody on this board I'm assuming would consider themselves to be experienced on the water...so we possess a better safety awareness/common sense on the water.....but the bulk of deaths occur with recreational boaters, novice boaters....sunny, good weather days also have the most deaths/accidents.....  it's purely an inconvenience of comfort to anglers but overall has potential to seriously reduce deaths in the big picture of things.  legislating mandatory pfd's would be aimed at reducing preventable death on the water......it's not a tax grab, it's not spoon feeding the weak/dumb/can't think for themselves....there's public interest behind it, perhaps not anglers or anybody else on this forum, but there is a public push for more enforcement.....  would you call a minimum 2k fine a tax grab for speeding 50km over?....it's applying enforcement where it makes a difference and people will actually be scared of the consequence and prevent them from repeating those same actions...it's no different than wearing a seatbelt....  you can't argue that using common sense ""should"" be able to prevent everything....common sense is a great idea in concept but it never works in reality because it simply doesn't exist in reality....and that's where the mandatory thing steps in....  ""Almost all boating victims are male (91%). Half (48%) of all boating victims are 35 to 64 years of age""........I'd say it would be very interesting how these stats would relate to the popular opinion on this board....."

In order for that information to be of any use what so ever we would have to know both the percentage of people who wear PFD's and the percentage of drowning victims who were wearing PFD's.  Even then it would have limited use if no stats for size of boats and whether conditions, etc. were not factored in.  Based on your information, 15% of drowning victims were wearing PFD's.  If, 10% of boaters wear PFD's and 15% of victims wear PFD's, that would indicate that wearing a PFD makes you 50% more likely to drown.  On other hand if 30% of boaters wear PFD's and 15% of victims were wearing a PFD, that would indicate that wearing a PFD makes you 50% less likely to drown.  Knowing that 85% of victims were not wearing a PFD without knowing what percent of boater were wearing a PFD is 100% useless information."

371652,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-11 16:15:00,1022," FYI airplanes and boats are two totally different things. You need hundreds of hours in a plane to become a pilot, whereas you need a few hours studying a book to receive your boaters license or learn how to swim. People who canoe and don't know how to swim should be well aware that a canoe can tip as easy as somebody leaning over to fart."
371654,Radnine,2009-08-11 16:22:00,1538," Amen to this post. Common sense also should have dictated that people wouldn't light up in an elevator or over a salad bar or in a car or office with others, but it didn't. The only thing common about sense is that people don't use it, so laws have to. Jim"
371656,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-11 16:26:00,1022," You set regulations saying children under the age of XXX to wear life jacket at all times. The swimming certificate/card you could get just like getting your drivers license. They would test you to see if you can swim. And like you mentioned if you don't know how to swim or your physical condition does not allow you to swim, then you are required to wear a PFD at all times. They could enforce it by doing patrols on the water like they do now for limits, licenses, safety gear. This change would create more jobs, although society would need to pay to play. They would have a may day handing out tickets, but the change could also steer people away from boating since they are being legislated to death. Theres pros and cons for anything."
371662,TJQ,2009-08-11 16:38:00,7806, When have I ever been a good example....
371666,TJQ,2009-08-11 16:46:00,7806," To me the entire thing is not about whether you should wear a lifejacket.. that's pretty obvious.. the thing for me is that in 50 years there are going to be so many regulations that you'll be breaking the law all the time cause you wont know whats legal and whats not.  I tell you if you get stopped by a CO and an OPP officer, if they spend enough time going through the boat and asking questions, they will soon enough find something that you are not compying with.  As far as Im concerned it all began with seatbelts.  yes they should be worn, no they shouldnt be madatory. started out as a ticket... now its point on your licence.   heres the next thing... if they ban the use of cell phones and the use of gps units, whats next.. i tell ya having a boiling hot timmies coffee in my hand is just as dangerous, so thats next no more drinking in the vehicle, and then.. next... if you get caught without both hands on the wheel.. you'll get a ticket.  Im not saying these things are not common sense, im just saying that the regulators never take a break.. next is (and i dont smoke) you wont be able to smoke in your own house if there is someone under 16 in the house.. dont think it cant happen??  Think again...  There's a reason my camp is so far in the bush.   PS.. it was only very recently that I found out its not mandatory for the kids to wear a life jacket.  Diod I make them wear them.. sure I did."
371668,theRJ,2009-08-11 16:48:00,55,Swimming test is useless. I can swim 1k across and 1k back across a lake without any problems (With a PFD towed behind me for the record). But if I have been knocked out for some reason that ability is meaningless. If you trip on a tackle box/rod/whatever and crack your head on the way out of your boat you're outta luck no matter how skilled you are in the water.  RJ
371669,Bernie,2009-08-11 16:50:00,3190,Please! No more legislation! Enough out there now. Time for people to be responsible for themselves instead of passing the buck to somebody else too.  I like your way of thinking TJ.
371674,Headhunter,2009-08-11 17:08:00,5703,"Amen Bernie and TJ, amen! For the life of me, I can't understand the mentality of some folks. They act like they are not capable of making a sensible decision in their life, without the government providing ""guidance"". The only thing we need more of, is less government! HH"
371675,dagoat_1,2009-08-11 17:38:00,72,"Enough with the regulations....... I never wore one (allways had one in reaching distance) until I bought a mustang this year so now i dont have an excuse not to and noticed the OPP boats pass right by me when doing their routine checks.   As TJ stated earlier, with all the regs. pretty soon wew ill all have something they can get us with if they look hard enough and if that day comes will you really be enjoying yourself out there what for mamy might be a few times a season? or too busy worring that you are complying with all the newly formed laws?"
371683,DanD,2009-08-11 18:20:00,2223,"Well I dive like a shovel and swim like a brick; do I wear my jacket all the time, no and I know I should; but for some reason its the last thing I think of as we're heading out, on a nice sunny day. Like a lot of people have already said; be aware of what’s happening around you. If it’s rough out or I’m in a boat with a cowboy showing me his stunts; the PFD is the first thing I look for; then I rake the guy over the coals for being an idiot. As for the analogy of being bonked on the head as you’re falling out of a boat; well with a PFD you’re still out of luck; only a true lifejacket will right you face up. Can you imagine trying to cast all day with one of those on? I really like the idea of the inflatable vests; but like someone else here has already mentioned; how do you know for sure it will work? Is there an expiry date or some form of pressure gauge on them?  Dan."
371685,Mattones,2009-08-11 18:24:00,587,Everytime I go out onto the water I ALWAYS wear a life jacket. I'm a good swimmer but I think I would have a panic attack if i had to swim half a mile to a mile to shore. Its one of my biggest fears being so far out and having to swim to shore. :|
371687,Jonny,2009-08-11 18:27:00,1380," The chance of being involved in an auto accident is FAR greater than the chance of falling into the water from a boat, and far more life-threatening. It's a matter of managing risks. YOU CAN'T MANAGE THEM ALL. And you can't enforce an ever-growing body of intrusive regulations.   Do you really think we need more government employees running around checking up on every little thing?  Here's something else to consider... you're out in your boat without your jacket on, and some goody-two-shoes takes a picture of you clearly not wearing a jacket, and your boat registration, and a time-stamp on the photo, and submits it to the OPP. You think that couldn't happen? I've got an 18x telephoto on my camera and I could take your picture without you even being aware of it.  There are too many people around who find some pleasure in meddling in other people's business. These part-time vigilantes don't need more grist for their mill."
371689,Jonny,2009-08-11 18:41:00,1380," Don't forget --- your boat can't sink. Proper flotation for boats (canoes, kayaks, any water craft) was regulated a long time ago.  I'm wondering what kind of catastrope you envision? If you wear your PFD when under power, you're safe (i.e. hitting a deadhead or a shoal). If you wear your PFD in rough water, you're safe. How likely is it you would have to swim to shore from an accident if you are fishing with the motor off or you are trolling?  Not that I'm downplaying your anxiety. If you feel uncomfortable, by all means wear the PFD at all times. It's just that I'm aghast at the number of people here who think that it should be mandatory for everyone at all times --- not that you specifically said that, but I gather you would be OK with it."
371692,Jonny,2009-08-11 18:47:00,1380,Here's the perfect PFD for those who feel the need to wear one and yet don't want the discomfort of a vest or the interference it causes when handling a fishing rod. Note that your upper torso has a perfectly free range of movement. 
371693,Raf,2009-08-11 18:47:00,3495,i'm a aghast by the number of people who need their hand held by the gov't in order to feel safe on the water.  use common sense folks!  stop the needless legislation.
371711,Joey,2009-08-11 20:10:00,9122,"  You're also S.O.L. if you trip and crack your head on the side of the tub while taking a bath, but we can't all walk around with bubble wrap taped to our bodies!!  Wear one if you want to, don't if you don't want to, its a personal choice and should stay that way.  Joey"
371714,Radnine,2009-08-11 20:21:00,1538," This is an interesting take Raf, but I don't want legislation to make me feel safe, I take care of that by wearing my PFD. The argument has become about legislation in general. And saying that all legislation is bad is painting with a very wide brush. So is assuming that everyone has common sense, because common sense would tell you to have your life jacket on all the time. I mentioned it earlier and will bring it up again, I don't think it is that much of a stretch to see the insurance companies being the ones to drive through some sort of ruling; Drown while wearing a PFD, Pay - Drown without one, not so much.

371483,kickingfrog,2009-08-11 03:21:00,8333,Now life jackets? The government is always getting in my way of fun.  Seat belts stopping for school buses motorcycle helmets speed limits crumple zones in cars asbestos in our buildings traffic laws criminal code building codes  I am tired of it. Why don't they just go back to something they're good at... wasting our tax dollars?
371487,John Bacon,2009-08-11 03:32:00,3277,They should definitely not be mandatory.  At least not for adults.  If it is a nice hot sunny day I don't want to be wearing a life jacket all day.  I think I can make that decision for myself.
371501,Rattletrap2,2009-08-11 04:42:00,1652,I wear mine whenever the boat is moving under power or if wind/water conditions warrant it. I do take it off when I am fishing though. These same rules go for whoever is in the boat with me.
371503,Jonny,2009-08-11 05:09:00,1380,"Mandatory? Definitely not!  I can judge the conditions for me and my passengers by myself, thank you very much.  I only wear mine when under power at high speed (not trolling), or in rough conditions. Kids in my boat always have to wear them."

My kids wear thiers all the time, and if they're in the boat, I  wear mine........usually.  Its all about common sense. My grandfather spent 60 years on the north atlantic. Couldn't swim to save his life, and has never had a PFD on. He's still alive and well for some reason?  You can't legislate common sense.  Stuff happens, life goes on.

371533,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-11 11:33:00,1022,They should make it mandatory that people who boat need to know how to swim. The only exception being seniors or disabled and they should be forced to wear a life jacket at all times. It is beyond me how somebody does not know how to swim
371546,Garnet,2009-08-11 12:14:00,2056,I were a hydrostadic inflatable when fishing alone. Very comfortable.  Garnet

371564,Headhunter,2009-08-11 13:09:00,5703,"Manditory wearing of PFD's will amount to nothing more than yet another government tax grab. I can see it now, your trolling around on Quinte in the fall and get ""pulled over"" for the 3rd time that day, because the OPP spotted someone on the boat that didn't have their PFD on. Now, this will happen, shortly after the first and 2nd pullover; checking licenses and then checking saftey equipment. And don't try and tell me that law enforcement isn't above hiding in the weeds, waiting for you to take your PFD off and nailing you for a $100.00 plus fine. This is typical knee jerk reaction to some rather unfortunate incidents that have taken place this summer... but really, is this much different than any other summer? If you HAVE to legislate, why not make it a requirement that anyone under the age of 16 must wear a PFD when on a vessle? At 16, many can't even spell common sense! That would appease, for the time being, those calling for legislation... until next summer when the whole thing is regretfully, repeated. Less government, more common sense is the answer if you ask me... and those without common sense, well they'll either get it or pay the price for having not taken an interest in their surroundings. It aint all a bowl of cherries, now is it! HH"
371565,POLLIWOGG,2009-08-11 13:14:00,835,I think your going to see it for canoes for sure and smaller craft with a cut of point at bigger boats just guessing around 20' or 24'.

It has become as natural as putting on a hat (can't fish without a hat). The gov't perhaps should not mandate it, but if I owned an insurance company I might think about adding a stipulation about it. I would have to think that most drowning deaths could have been avoided with a PFD. Jim"
371576,friarfish,2009-08-11 13:48:00,5,"I'm sure the same argument was made about seatbelts before they were made mandatory.  Now I wear mine without thinking about it - No big deal.  I wonder how many people would even carry a lifejacket in the boat if it wasn't law?  Accidents happen and they don't happen the way you'd expect them to.  If you fall out of the boat and knock your head on something, you're toast.  A life jacket might improve your odds of surviving - I say make it mandatory."
371578,Jonny,2009-08-11 13:50:00,1380," Did you mean to say, ""They should make it mandatory that people who boat need to know how to swim, or else must wear a lifejacket"" ?  What about children?  Even so, I think you would want to re-think that. How would you ever enforce it?  It would be just one more useless, intrusive piece of regulation, IMO.  I can just imagine an enforcement officer stopping a boat... ""OK, you, you and you with no lifejacket on... jump in and I'll see if you can tread water."""
371579,Flappn,2009-08-11 13:53:00,245,"I never wear my life jacket and I do not want anyone telling me I have to...I have had enough of the Government ruling my life.  My daughter wears her life jacket every time she is in the boat under power or not. It's all about double standards, my dad did it to me he never wore one and I always had to. My daughter is in swimming lessons and can swim better than most her age. Any person who decides to venture on the water should know how to swim. Accidents happen wear swimming won't help but car accidents happen as well...that's why we call it an accident.  Accidents happen, people have to stop and think. Is it wise not to wear my life jacket maybe..but it's my choice. I get Claustrophobic and do not like to be in tight spots or wear tight fitting items. I have the same issue with seat belts in my vehicle."
371580,Jonny,2009-08-11 13:57:00,1380," While we're at it, why don't we make it mandatory that swimmers (whether on supervised beaches or elsewhere) have to wear lifejackets? I think more people drown while swimming than boating."
371582,Bob,2009-08-11 13:59:00,370,"Sure let's legislate it.  In the same bill we should outlaw sky-diving because no one with a lick of sense would jump out of a perfectly good airplane for sport.  Let's also legislate the wearing of leathers for all motorcyclists regardless of temperature, to save them from roadrash if they're dumb enough to drop it.  While we're at it let's restrict all boats to 30 mph, it's a fairly safe speed and you could still water ski.  Hang-gliding?  Mountain climbing?  Sorry, I'm with TJ on this one.  Too much legislation already."
371583,Jonny,2009-08-11 14:02:00,1380,"And let's legislate that all outboard motors have to have a kill switch. At one stroke we could ""outlaw"" countless thousands of outboards."
371589,craigdritchie,2009-08-11 14:06:00,1586,"Like many others who have already replied, I wear one some of the time - it depends on the boat and the season. In a small boat or a canoe, it's always on. In a bass boat, I wear it when underway, and usually slip it off to fish. On a big-water boat trolling for salmon, I generally don't wear one at all. Regardless of the boat, I always wear a survival suit early and late in the season.  Common sense, really.  The inflatable models are really comfortable, and totally worth the additional cost."
371369,knightfisher,2009-08-10 22:46:00,237,"There has been a very high casualty rate for boaters/fisherman in Ontario recently. It's been in the papers and on the news. Most of the people were not wearing a life jacket.  I personally always wear mine whether in the canoe or tinny. I may take it off if I'm going to anchor for while, however if there are rough waters or wakes from other boats the life jacket stays on.  Do you wear one ? Do you think it should be mandatory ?  This question has probably been asked before.  Just curious about your views."
371377,SBCregal,2009-08-10 23:01:00,688,"i saw an article in the star about this today.  myself, i rarely wear mine when im in the boat, unless it starts getting rougher out.  probably not ideal, but its what seems to happen.  im not quite sure how i feel about making them mandatory... its probably a good idea as well, but i dont know if making them mandatory will change much.  seems like many of the accidents that ive heard about in the news involve alot more factors than just not wearing a lifejacket (speed, carelessness, intoxication)"
371378,timmeh,2009-08-10 23:01:00,609,"Whenever I'm in the kayak I wear it 100% of the time, no questions about it. If I'm fishing from a boat I will wear it when the waters rough, but honestly I will take it off if I'm fishing a spot for a while.  I personally do not think it should be mandatory. You can't protect people from everything and you need to be responsible for your own actions. And if you feel you don't need one that's your choice, and it shouldn't be forced upon you. With no disrespect meant at all to the victims, and while life jackets likely would have saved some of their lives, most people end up in trouble because they made bad decisions on or before they went out on the water, unrelated to wearing a life jacket.  Also would everyone follow the law all the time if it were made? And would wearing a life jacket convince to take more risks on the water (ie. more speed, rough water) because they feel safer?"
371386,misfish,2009-08-10 23:12:00,29133,"It all comes down to commen sence. Most of the drownings were from not thinking.

Friends venturing into wild waters and not knowing the conditions.Non swimmers again.Sad news.  The other was a guy speeding in his boat.Speed kills.Sad news.  Think of what your doing.

I think the big increase  in boating and water accidents come from what we call ' cityits' all the urban families who get into boating or fishing and become cocky. i remember when we used to have a cottage up muskoka and it used to be great,lots of fun and the local police were veryyy cool about certain things,like having a 6 pack on a tinny ect. all the party kids from the city come up,get drunk and go swiming or boating,and end up on the news. now the police are strict up there.  speaking of cityits, we had a bunch across our camp site  on the weekend and they had loud techno and dance music blasing all day and night. what kind of camping is that!?!?!?"

It's very sad that these accidents happen but they could have been avoided. Swimming beneath a raging falls from recent rain in frothing white water is not a good idea with a life jacket or not. One knock on the head and the life jacket won't be much help either. Having a child swim in a current and slowly drift from shore without constant adult supervision isn't a good idea. Deciding to go on a boat ride at 3am while intoxicated with a bunch of buddies....etc. It's all about common sense and to take preventative steps. I personally don't wear a life jacket when fishing but if it's rough, late at night or speeding I'll throw one on just in case, even though I'm a competent swimmer.  Be safe"

371440,Dutch,2009-08-11 00:58:00,831,"I think the laws need to change and make it mandatory.  However, I think it would be just like poaching far too many people would skirt the law and do what they wanted anyway.  It is unfortunate.  As far as I am concerned - I wear mine under power of the big motor, when I am alone, when the water is chilly or when it is windy as they do a good job of keeping you warm.  I also wear it on water in which I am not all that familiar with.  This year, I probably have worn it 60%+ of the time.  A good tip - attach your kill switch to your life jacket.  Can't start the boat without the PFD on that way.  I also think there needs to be some support from the manufacturers of the manual/auto inflate jackets to bring the prices down so that everyone can afford them.  More people would wear PFD's if they aren't as heavy and cumbersome.  Not everyone has $200-$300 to drop on a mustang vest."
371441,Musky or Specks,2009-08-11 00:58:00,2710,3. Fishing water colder than 60*F  Thats when I wear mine and generally its my floater suit. Ive gone in by accident many times. Thats why I learned to swim when I was small somehow I sensed that I wouldnt have much sense as an adult. And I NEVER mix alchohol and boating /swimming/water activities.
371443,TJQ,2009-08-11 01:01:00,7806,"I wear mine occasionally, and make the kids wear them when we are underway.  To me making it mandatory is just one more way the government can control my actions, based on a knee jerk reaction to a flurry of fatalities. (Like the gun registry and boaters cards, which have both proven themselves to be useless.) I tell ya what, they can mandate whatever they want, it doesn't mean ill do it.  It may not be politically correct, but its the way I feel."
371445,Greencoachdog,2009-08-11 01:09:00,8163,"  Alcohol is for the end of the day, when all the fishing and boating is finished and it's time to shoot the ship around the campfire or internet!    If you make the kids wear one... shouldn't you wear one as well?... to be a good example?"
371451,HTHM,2009-08-11 01:21:00,4082,I put my inflatable on at the same time as I put the plug in the boat. It doesn't come off until I cinch down the stern.
371462,Greencoachdog,2009-08-11 01:33:00,8163,  Is that because you make Bean soup while out on the water???
371467,crankbait,2009-08-11 01:38:00,82," I never fish alone but if I was older, fished alone on a boat and near dams. I too would wear a pfd all the time."
