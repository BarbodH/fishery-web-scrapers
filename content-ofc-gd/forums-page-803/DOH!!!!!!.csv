The music was really, really loud, so I timed my farts with the beat.  After a couple of songs, I started to feel better. I finished my lunch and noticed that everybody was staring at me.  Then I suddenly remembered that I was listening to my iPod."

371663,bassman87,2009-08-11 16:39:00,586," Don't wanna come of rude, but that sounds like an ignorant thing to say. I'm pretty sure ""eskimos"" or shall I say Inuits and Mexicans would feel alittle offended by your comment."
