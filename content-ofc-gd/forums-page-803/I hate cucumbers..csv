371374,bigugli,2009-08-10 22:53:00,6138,"To quote a song; ""to everything... there is a season...""  Summer harvests mean canning season. Feels kinda weird doing all this stuff without the Mrs. around. We usually work on this together through the season.  Anyhow, after 8 hours effort we went from this:  A lot of prep work:   to produce this:   I don't want to look at another cuke for a month  , But I'll be staring at em again in another week or so."
371381,misfish,2009-08-10 23:05:00,29133,I think there should be a market/selling pinned thread for this kinda stuff. Im in for 5 jars atleast.  Nice work Bruce.
371387,BUSTER,2009-08-10 23:12:00,1336,"ill take 5 jars , great for the duck blind!"
371388,misfish,2009-08-10 23:15:00,29133,"Now if you could can moose,well then,you could make a fine dollar from me.LOL"
371389,danbouck,2009-08-10 23:16:00,4380,I'm in for 5 jars
371395,bigugli,2009-08-10 23:23:00,6138,"Heck, that first 50 jars barely gets us through til next summer.  Thanks for the compliments guys. Just hope they taste as good as when wifey was doing them. Usually I do the washing and prepping while she does the actual preserving and mixing."
371398,ciceri,2009-08-10 23:25:00,535,"Thanks for reminding me, just ate like 15 baby dills.. But those look great, do you sell them?"
371399,Leecher,2009-08-10 23:26:00,7832,I'll take a 5 pack for sure     They look yummy!!!! Jacques
371431,crappieperchhunter,2009-08-11 00:40:00,2582,"It's a lot of work, but those gleaming jars look oh so nice when they are all full. If I get down again this winter for smelt I'd be honored to do a taste test to see if your pickle skills are as good as the bosses. The ones I had last winter where bang on!"
371435,hammercarp,2009-08-11 00:44:00,964,That looks great. I hope they taste great for you too.
371449,bigugli,2009-08-11 01:18:00,6138,"They look good, but,,,, I gotta wait 6 weeks before they are ready to taste."
371454,Daplumma,2009-08-11 01:22:00,1961,"Good stuff there bud.I'm getting over run with Tomatoes,Okra,Squash,Beets ,Raspberries and Blackberries.We should have a thread of garden pics here. Joe"
371457,keram,2009-08-11 01:28:00,585,"Looks good  . I do not hate them, I love them  . I'm ready for the weekend  ( the yearly entertainment)   Usually I do  about 100 jars. Busy for few hrs.. Opened last one from previous year. I do not know your recipe, but I use also 1/2 ts of pickling spices, bay leaves and horse radish. I cannot buy this ""jewel"" in the store"
371470,keram,2009-08-11 01:43:00,585, Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Tooooooooooooo Loooooooooooong   I enjoy mine in about two weeks  Before the weekend I'm  going to check how wild mushrooms are doing in the forest.  Hopeing for this    this     and this  
371473,POLLIWOGG,2009-08-11 01:49:00,835,"We picked 4 bushel today but if you want cucumbers don't wait, with this weather they could blight and be gone in no time."
371521,bigugli,2009-08-11 10:37:00,6138, All depends on the recipe. We used to do fermented dills. 10 weeks.  Gave up on that process. Some decades back woke up in the middle of the night to gunshots  . Go down to the basement to see pickle jars exploding everywhere.   The house reeked for days.  There is an old oak leaf recipe my Mom has that I have to try again. A distinct flavour.
371560,keram,2009-08-11 12:49:00,585,"To prevent ""gunshots""   I stop fermentation process after about 7-10 days ( depends on temp) by putting jars in big container  with water, then bring the water to the boiling point, remove jars and cool them down in upside-down position. This prevent the air going inside and make a very tight seal."
371601,TC1OZ,2009-08-11 14:32:00,987,  Some of those look magical
371665,keram,2009-08-11 16:43:00,585,"Magical ???? what kind ????? I do not pick m-rooms that make ( after eating them)1.5 lb bass looks like 6.5 lb bass   ( wrong kind of magic)  , but there is some magic in it, if you compare the taste and smell ( particularly dried) to store bought m-rooms (what I personally call ""toilet paper shaped like m-rooms"", you will notice the difference. After 40 years of enjoying them I know the difference"
