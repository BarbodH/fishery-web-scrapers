372039,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-12 17:34:00,1022,Try to read up on their feeding patterns during the specified time of year. It will also depend on what food sources are available on a particular lake. Hope this helps.
372042,Syn,2009-08-12 17:53:00,519,"When I catch my first fish there then that's a good indication, based on the colour and type of lure I used to catch the fish. brown, maybe crawdad, white- shiner, yellow green -perch and panfish (pike fishing). Sometimes I get lucky and the fish coughs up its lunch and then I can tell for sure what they are feeding on.  Also I'm always mindful of seeing the small fish and try casting using a similar lure in the area in case the bigger fish are feeding on them. ok that last part was common sense."
372046,diggyj,2009-08-12 18:11:00,548,Knowledge from locals is key.  If you are hitting a new body of water ask the locals or any of the tackle shop owners. They should be able to give you some great advice since they have probably been fishing those waters for several years.  Dirk
