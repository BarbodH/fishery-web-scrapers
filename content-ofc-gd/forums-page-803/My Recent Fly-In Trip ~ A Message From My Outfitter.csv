372051,F_ast,2009-08-12 18:21:00,154,"Again, I am not complaining or agruing the fact that their locations are secret or that ""someone rubbing their sucess in someones face"", I value the opinions and concerns of the people that are trying to preserving natural and wild gems.  I get it.  But, any time you post up a topic names ""Lake of a Million Walleye"", ya you are going to get questions and comments and hell have someone ask you for your secret spot, colour pattern, time of day time of year... whatever.  Just asking that you not carp about it.   Solo, I am not really directing this at you becasue i know you are just trying to relay a concern felt by others, as well as yourself, and i understand these areas are precious to many.  BillM, I am sorry that I do not have enough posts for you to recognize me as someone with something to share; I didnt realize that 50 post was the time you were able to contribute of give comments.  Thats unfortunite.  I do frequent these forums, more purpose/ species driven than this one.  I am a new member to this particular forum though.  Excuse me for not replying to every new topic with a response of ""great job"".  But I tend to spend more of my time constructively doing the things I love... not so much reading about them.  ^^^ look the equivilant of 100 posts right there."

372055,brw,2009-08-12 18:31:00,101,"Solo: I loved your post and got quite a vicarious kick out of it. I understand completely why you didn't divulge location, and it makes more sense now as I read the outfitter's e-mail. Ontario is a huge, wonderful place full of honey holes. I've found a few and had a few days like you had recently, and I hope to find some more. And it makes it all the sweeter when you find them yourself."
372057,blaque,2009-08-12 18:38:00,2419," Your original response to ""Lake of a million walleye"" OOZED a tone quite different than.... ""I'm good with the choice of Solo not to divulge the location/outfitter.""  That report deserved a heckuva lot more than the taste of..........""so wheres this lake at, whatta u afraid someones gonna fish there too""  The time it took them to document the report amidst all the hard work they put in, dirty, sweatin, wind, weather etc......upload all of the images onto a photo server once at the comforts of home, arrange all the photo links in sequence to compose a report.........narrate the whole story, .......just so i can take a look and witness it. Deserves a whole lot more than a complaint.  Wasting space on the forum with idle congrats? Thats just someones way of saying, hey, i took the time to look at your report and just wanted to acknowledge the work you put into it. Expressing a gripe about someones hard work to share something that I've never experienced is in my opinion, the waste of space.  I dont care how many posts someone has, as long as one of them isnt one with an ingrateful tone."

372061,TJQ,2009-08-12 18:59:00,7806,"Great report... .. if you don't think people flyin to these lakes.. here's a story for you. This is absolutely true!!  4 or 5 years ago, Monique, I and the two kids were on a weeklong flyin at a spot we went to every year.  We had been in for three or four days, when around noon, a small float plane lands on the lake.  He moors on shore across the lake, unloads a portaboat, and with a kid they get in and start fishing. Well being the friendly folks we are we get in our boat to go out and ask if he wants to have a shore lunch with us.  As we put over and get about 50 feet from him, I say Hi!!... he says ""HEY!! your that family I always see on the internet!!""  I was actually a bit flattered.  I asked him if he came often and he said it was his first time that he had just watched our video from the year before and flew in from Timmin's to try it out.  He asked me where the pickeral were, and I told him truthfully that there was no pickeral in the lake, but it was LOADED with pike, which is the reason we liked it, lots of action.  His kid then proceeds to proudly pipe up and say, ""well no big deal, Dads got a freezer full of pickeral at the cottage anyway!!""  As soon as he found out there was no pickeral in the lake, he putted back to the plane and promptly took off.  The guy wasnt a dick or anything.  I dont blame the outfitter at all."
372070,T-Bone,2009-08-12 19:48:00,160,"Okay....I give Blaque...if you have to be right, so be it....  Solo...awesome report, really...probably one of the best, if not the best, I've ever read. As a communications director, I understand that what you did in your report is not easy to do. You put your audience inside your experience and made everyone feel like they were there...and wishing they were there...with you.  I appreciate your efforts in detailing the trip, and I appreciate your position to keep the outfitter and location to yourself and your trusted friends.  With some work and some keen observance, I'd bet someone out there could 'figure it out' based on your pictures and the outfitters prose. I don't have time for it myself, so wherever it is won't see my shadow anytime soon.  Good luck with the remainder of your soft water season. Be safe out there."

372106,T-Bone,2009-08-12 21:11:00,160,"Thought you'd like that. But, in reality and after reading my first response, you were right to a degree. And I meant everything I said to Solo in my last post...I do appreciate it."
372111,BillM,2009-08-12 21:23:00,17367,"  Ah, so by trying to make a point, you go out of your way to insult people that actually enjoy saying 'nice job!' and 'well done!' on other people's threads?  I'm sorry if you fit the mold of the low post count/hungry for information type poster.   If you really aren't here for that, try making some contributions to the site and become an active member....  I was out on the water close to 100 days last year, shouldn't I have a low post count to?  "

372142,ctdd2006,2009-08-12 23:01:00,531,"Good for you solo!   Glad you guys had a great trip.  I for one personally know three guys with float planes that would love to know your spot.....and I for one am glad you kept it private.  I love hearing reference of the Great George T.   I had the honour of meeting him, fish and golf with him.  Great man.  Surprisingly a great golfer too!  Cheers."
372156,Jonny,2009-08-12 23:35:00,1380," I guess you have your reasons for targeting that area, but having grown up in Sudbury/Sturgeon Falls and having lived in Timmins for 32 years before moving to North Bay, I would suggest that you might also look at the Soo-Sudbury-North Bay corridor. The fishing opportunities are somewhat limited in Timmins/Cochrane compared to further south. Much fishing requires long drives, and because there are many fishermen and relatively few accessible lakes, the fishing pressure is often quite high. Also I think the fishing opportunities are more varied further south.  That's my take, anyway.  Nothing against the Timmins area, I enjoyed it, but given a choice I would consider the ""Near North"" as well."
372164,bucktail,2009-08-12 23:49:00,1857,"I have it on good info that it really was Little Lake near a town called Barrie, but I could be wrong!"
371951,solopaddler,2009-08-12 12:18:00,8605,"Over the last few days I have received several negative comments from some members both in reply to my post and also via pm wondering why I didn't include the details on where I went on the fly in trip. I tried to explain my reasoning in my trip post but this explains things much clearer and I thought you might be interested in reading this.  The following excerpt was copied and pasted from an email sent to me last night from my outfitter:   ""If you could please do me a huge favor in return I would ask that you don't give out the lake name of the camp you were at. The problem is that once people find out about an amazing fishing spot they will go to incredible ends to cut trails or will fly their own airplanes in. I've seen it happen many times and the outcome is never good. We protect our lakes hoping to pass them down to our children one day. The reason flying in is so amazing is the fact that local people do not disturb the lake but when the lake name gets out it can be disastrous. Imagine as a customer, paying to fly in, only to find other people already fishing your private lake. People may also walk the river during the spawning periods and disturb the eco balance of both lakes.  I am really truly impressed that you had the foresight not to include the lake name in your report saving me a lot of grief.  Thanks again so much!""   Yes I have provided the info to some of those who pm'd me asking. Not all though, only those who I either knew or felt I could trust.  I've run into the same negative reaction before from members who want info handed to them. Perhaps this might help make them understand.  Cheers,  Mike"
371959,blaque,2009-08-12 13:02:00,2419,"No explanation needed on my end. Its funny, but i never even thought to ask where you were lol.  Its funny how most that get upset about lack of details are the ones that just came to the forum with a handful of posts."
371960,Roy,2009-08-12 13:02:00,13728,"Good post Mike and yes, it is completely understandable."
371965,Spiel,2009-08-12 13:13:00,9065,"I can't honestly say (never having met the ""outfitter"") whether the the ""outfitters"" purpose is one of genuine concern for the fish or his ability to exploit the fishery (no debate on this is needed!). He obviously has a vested interest in it and if he's asking Mike not to mention the lake by name then so be it. What I do gain from this is that Mike is a guy who can be trusted. Knowing this would certainly allow me to freely share info with Mike (not that I could offer much....LOL).  If I was interested in going on such a trip I'd simply ask Mike if he'd share the name of the ""outfitter"" with me, nothing more."
371970,tonyb,2009-08-12 13:26:00,1637,I thought everyone would have recognized the lake from the backgrounds...it was Lake Ecks for sure
371985,gdelongchamp,2009-08-12 14:06:00,199,"In my years in the north, ""Red Lake"", and my connections with most outfitters with fly-in outposts, they all to-day share the same concerns as those expressed by your outfitter.  I have been to numerous outposts, by canoe, on my travels in the north and also managed outposts for up to 6 monts of the year.  Fishing that you encountered at your fly-in is quite typical with most fly ins. However, the defining factor is whether the fisherman is willing to put in the extra effort one day of the week or five or seven days of the week to enjoy the rewards. You obviously enjoy working for your fish and that pleases me to see. You will get more out of your trips.  Your posts remind me of my days in the bush in the far north be it the Red Lake area amd near the Territories.  ""The smaller shore lunch size ""3 pounders"" were everywhere you dropped a line.  If you hadn't found the fish by mid morning, at shore lunch we would take the time to explore your tecniques as you were doing something wrong.  Because the tourists were in camp for seven days we required all guides to fish a different lake every day.  This would help ease the pressure on the larger mature walleyes.  In our outposts we completely discouraged the use of live bait, it wasn't necessary and of course fish finders as they could too easily locate the larger schools of mature walleyes and would receive considerable pressure by six or eight fishermen over a period of five days. ""The lazy fishermen.""  Walleye are elusive and we all know it. Here to-day and gone tomorrow.  I am convinced that the fish finders are and have been the major factor in the detriment of the walleye fishery in Ontario in the Sudbury area and south.  As for the fly-ins, if the outfitter has not managed the resources well then he will be left with a dormant outpost. No return business. In time however that will change when the new crew who fish the lake with new ideas and determination will find the treasures that have been laying dormant for a few summers.  Please forgive the ramble on aspect of this post. I enjoy your posts as they bring back many fond memories of my days in the bush and in the the far north near the territories."
371987,craigdritchie,2009-08-12 14:11:00,1586,"Mike,  Now you know one of the reasons I walked away from a pretty good career as an outdoor writer. Keep a good spot under your hat and you catch flak for it. Name the place, and you contribute toward wiping it out. You can't win."
371989,solopaddler,2009-08-12 14:21:00,8605," Thanks for that insight, very interesting.    That's a shame then Craig. Personally I've always enjoyed reading what you had to say. You may not remember this but I met you a couple years back at the Catt. At that time you said you were freelancing for several different Stateside mags?"
371995,T-Bone,2009-08-12 14:44:00,160,"  I wasn't trying to cause a mess out here...or consciously break etiquette...and I wasn't being negative...I was just wondering. Yes...the catch was impressive. The price is downright cheap (I would've guessed $1500+). If you don't want to divulge the info in public, I understand. Like you, I have hundreds of profiles on outfitters from Quebec to Saskatchewan and hundreds of hours in the 'homework'.  However, if someone asked me ""where should I go if I want to catch a lot of quality walleye...""...I'd give them the info I have...seems petty to say, ""go do the homework yourself and find your own locations..."". It's up to them whether they want to spend the money or go through the rigamaroll of a fly-in.  Neither position is right or wrong...just different."
371996,craigdritchie,2009-08-12 14:47:00,1586,"Thanks, I appreciate that. And I do remember speaking with you by the river ... that was a pretty good day as I recall. Lots of friendly silver fishies.  I've written for a bunch of US fishing magazines over the years ... Fishing Facts, In-Fisherman, Outdoor Life, Saltwater Sportsman, Bassmaster, and a bunch of other little regional rags no one has ever heard of. They all paid fairly well, but one catch was that they would always forward letters and emails from readers asking for more info, and it took so much time to deal with those that in the end it just wasn't worthwhile. At one point a junior editor at In-Fisherman accidentally listed my home phone number at the end of a story, and I got calls at all hours of the day and night for months afterward. The now ex-wife was definitely not amused."
372000,solopaddler,2009-08-12 14:56:00,8605,"  Sorry but that's kind of funny. I can envision my wifes reaction in the same situation LOL! Even now when the phone rings she says ""You get it, it's probably one of your fishing friends"" If the phone woke her up in the middle of the night there'd be hell to pay."
372001,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-12 15:00:00,10439,Sorry Craig I have to admit that the editor putting your home # in the story is pretty funny. What the heck was he thinking!!!!! Were you compensated for the stupidity of this person?? ?? ??
372002,F_ast,2009-08-12 15:12:00,154,"I totally understand wanting to keep a lid on your top secret spot, or you little piece of tranquility... but why bother posting about and writting up a review?  Keep it to yourslef if you and others dont want people to know about it.  If you are going to go on about a place, dont be so negative to people who want to learn of you discovery.  Not fighting you, just a suggestion."
372003,craigdritchie,2009-08-12 15:27:00,1586,Drifter ..... he made amends last year - at Ruth's Chris. best steak I've had in a long time.
372009,LeXXington,2009-08-12 15:50:00,1928,"Great post, No issue with not telling,  If your outfitter wanted lots of business he can post here  if he/she prefers too keep it quiet thats a business choice.  No one owns the lake so I would keep it quiet"
372014,BillM,2009-08-12 16:05:00,17367,Anyone else notice it's the guys with less then 50 posts which are whining about the lake info not being given out?
372015,lookinforwalleye,2009-08-12 16:10:00,4399,I don`t know maybe I just have a hard time understanding things. The operator says our lakes does he mean his lake or does he mean our as in you me and the guy next door? Is this a private lake or is the lake on crown land. To me it seems kind of silly to suggest that if the name of the lake gets out there will be a squadron of float planes decending on on the lake and floatila of boats pounding the fishery.I certainly see why the operator has concerns after all he is making his living off our resource. For many different reasons most fishermen will never have the opportunity to fish the remote north and that is to bad because it looks like a great experience. I myself have never been on a fly-in trip but it is on the bucket list and as a matter of fact the wife and I are seriously looking at buying a summer home in the Timmins/Cochrane area to enjoy our beautiful resource.  BTW I hope you keep posting reports of your trips they are spectacular.
372022,Jay T,2009-08-12 16:23:00,282,"People need to grow up, you don't need to know deal with it. I really like your posts and that one reminded me of one of my fly-in trips.  Jay"
372024,solopaddler,2009-08-12 16:57:00,8605, Just a suggestion but you may want to re read my statements. As I mentioned several times I've told numerous people the specifics about the trip via pm.
372030,Nemo,2009-08-12 17:09:00,727,Secret Spots are as much a part of fishing as bragging about the big one and other fish stories. All part of the fun IMHO.  Great report. Seeing how hard it was to get in there you deserve everything you got. Kudos on the hard work and thanks for sharing.
372033,solopaddler,2009-08-12 17:14:00,8605," As is the case with all outpost camps the outfitter has a land use permit from the mnr to operate a commercial outpost on the lake. Beyond that the lake is surrounded by crown land and anyone can access it and fish, camp, etc. There's an unwritten code of honour amongst outfitters that they won't fly into each others lakes. They are ""his"" lakes in the sense that he's more or less the unofficial caretaker of the resource, both for his own commercial interests and also out of genuine care for the state of the fisheries.    There's a big difference between say an outpost camp 100km north of the Albany river waaay beyond the last logging roads and an outpost located in northern Algoma near Chapleau. Make absolutely no mistake, if locals found out about the quality of the fishing the lake would be decimated.  If you'd like to read an incredibly interesting book check out Trespassing In Gods Country by George Therriault. It's about the life and times of a well known Ontario outfitter and bushpilot and he touches on this very topic. His son still runs air ivanhoe out of Folyet...great people and outfitters btw.  Cheers"
372037,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-12 17:29:00,10439,Mike I think you should post the co-ordinates of your hot spot on the internet for all to see just like the Fishin' Canada guys do.
372043,Spiel,2009-08-12 17:57:00,9065,"  You're kidding right?  Personally I enjoy reading about members fishing trips. As for the where they fished, it never needs to be mentioned. It's the report that the posters have taken the time to put together, for our enjoyment, complete with photos that matters to me.  Thanks Mike, again great report!"
372044,T-Bone,2009-08-12 17:58:00,160," Once again, I'm good with the choice of Solo not to divulge the location/outfitter. Completely up to him.  As for post totals, I'd have about 2,000+ now if every time I read a post I'd reply something lame like ""Great report...thanks for sharing."" Stuff like that accounts for 98% or more of most members' totals. I've been a member for years, I just choose not to waste the space with idle-congrats to bloat the ""perceived"" value of my opinion.  Blaque, do you really value the opinion or insights of someone that has 5,000 posts MORE than someone that has 50? Really? If so, that's a shame and speaks volumes about you."
