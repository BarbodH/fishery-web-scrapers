Any Info would be greatly appreciated.  Also we will be in the area 1-2 days prior to our scheduled trip.  Any suggestions on nearby lakes to fish? We will be bringing our own boat (Lund Pro-V 1775 )  Thanks in advance"

371881,jblack,2009-08-12 02:29:00,2,Thanks for the info we are going to rainbow point. Wish I had thought to look for this site first before booking. The owners of Rainbow Point have however been great so far.   Have purchased a lake map as a starting point.  I appreciate the info on the musky.  How was the walleye and smallmouth? Any starting points that worked well for you?  Did you perch fish at all?  Again thanks for responding.  I have had 62 people look but only one response.  Any additional info would be great.  Also how is the trip between the 2 lakes (1775 lund with a 75 hp honda )  Any depth problems in that channel.  Thanks
