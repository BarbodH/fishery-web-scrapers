If your anything like me you have tons of pictures after a trip and love showing them off, with Facebooks new policy on ""Having full rights to use your picture in any context they would like"" Some precautions must be taken.  So I introduce to you, http://www.picthefish.com  This site is solely dedicated to fishing images. You can be assured your site will not be intermingled with unsuitable images.  Feel free to join for free and start uploading all your fishing pictures  Take care everyone"

371869,splashhopper,2009-08-12 01:57:00,2931," If all us old guys are using photobucket now,, it won;t be ""kewl"" much longer.... just ask my daughters"
371876,Syn,2009-08-12 02:11:00,519,"picthefish is a great idea.  I'm tired after fishing all day, so I use picassa and upload the pics and video to my gmail account. IIRC they give you 1 gig to use and I can just send one link to the whole photo album for the fishing trip  (private or public viewing) to a buddy.  lol Where can I find fishing buddies like those."
371925,jediangler,2009-08-12 05:06:00,1923,"Come on GCD, they're consenting adults. I like to check it daily to see what kind of fish are being caught all over the world. Usually between 36 and 50 pics a day go up. That's good fish porn."
