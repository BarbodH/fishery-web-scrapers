372192,Jonny,2009-08-13 01:15:00,1380," Nope. If you're not happy with what they're doing, you might as well say so.  Somebody might pick up on it for next year."
372196,solopaddler,2009-08-13 01:31:00,8605,"  Exactly!  No one likes to be twisted, pulled, squished and pushed around like GUMBY by their local government!  Oops you said ""NIMBY"" cocept.  Nevermind."
371769,misfish,2009-08-11 23:16:00,29133,"Sent a letter to the BARRIE ADVANCE today.  ENOUGH BARRIE  Yes enough. As a tax payer and having to put up with event after event here in Barrie I have finally had enough. The past two weekends we have had Kempenfest and a triafilon.Now this weekend we have carafest.A run off of carabana. The problem here is,they take our parking place for our trucks/cars and trailers where we park after we launch to put midways and last weekend was for bikes.Parking is bad enough as it is with all the new construction going on. Barrie needs to look at the plan much better then they are right now.   Dont get me wrong,we enjoy the events,but dont take up parking spaces.  Signed  We just want to go boating.   Am I wrong here?"
371774,Greencoachdog,2009-08-11 23:25:00,8163,Try not to be so whiny... it detracts from your manliness!
371777,misfish,2009-08-11 23:29:00,29133," I,ll bet if it was your back yard,you wouldnt be so happy."
371778,Terry,2009-08-11 23:30:00,14456,well that sucks don't it you should take thursday off work and go smallmouth fishing with me in protest
371780,Fisherman,2009-08-11 23:33:00,7201,"I once suggested they do their biking, running and walking down the middle lane of the 400 on a Monday morning at 700am and see the results.  I agree, it's a major PITA."
371781,misfish,2009-08-11 23:33:00,29133, The midway is already set up in the lot.5 friggn days of this.

371784,solopaddler,2009-08-11 23:37:00,8605,"Seems to me it's a sign Barrie is thriving and that's got to be good.  Hey listen, my town of Grimsby is ridiculous as far as traffic and parking within the town goes on a daily basis. You take the good with the bad that's life."
371786,Greencoachdog,2009-08-11 23:39:00,8163,  Urban life sux big time!!!  ... might as well suck on the exhaust pipe of a Beamer eh!

371788,misfish,2009-08-11 23:42:00,29133,"Not when they take the only place to park.    I can smell Cow dung,if thats what you mean. LOL"
371793,solopaddler,2009-08-11 23:51:00,8605, Pretty much do that everyday on the QEW on my way to work.  Nothing worse than A types in their Beamers who think they own the road swarming around everyone like killer bees...
371794,Greencoachdog,2009-08-11 23:54:00,8163,"  It's yer upper lip Bubba!!!  When you have a driveway, you don't have to worry aboot a place to park!"
371812,misfish,2009-08-12 00:24:00,29133,"Brings me back to an ole thread,,,,,,,    NEVER MIND. Little people dont matter.  I,ll trailer up to Orilla. Much nicer folks up there."
371814,Gerritt,2009-08-12 00:25:00,6129,"I think you lost me as a reader of you're editorial.... with ""triafilon""  LOL..  Just joking Brian! good on you for standing up in what you believe in!  G"

371861,misfish,2009-08-12 01:51:00,29133," Why are you busting my balls?  You dont live here or know whats up.   That is our next move.Turning into little Toronto up here,"
371865,Lunatic,2009-08-12 01:51:00,536,"ya,move. then that town expands....move again to another one, untill that one expands too. all the cityits invade!! anyone seen waterdown the last 10 years? its not what it used to be.  the song- write about it - lynyrd skynyrd"
371868,misfish,2009-08-12 01:57:00,29133,"Interestering reponse from one viewer.  this song is about all of our homes, and neigborhoods, and we are losing that to to much gov't"
371884,2kj,2009-08-12 02:37:00,77,Next time rent a big ass uhaul and park it right where they would set up one of their stupid mid way rides.  Thats got to be worth the price of the rental!
371892,Greencoachdog,2009-08-12 02:56:00,8163,
371929,Mattitude,2009-08-12 05:27:00,155,You know you're welcome in O-town anytime!
372133,misfish,2009-08-12 22:39:00,29133," Me mudder would kick yer   Love the port Matt. Were off next week and will be making a stop before heading to Sparrow,then where ever, after that. To bad the casino didnt put something in for the boaters. Or is there?   Guess I should of been more clearer on my post.  The city was fineing people for parking in places that were meant for trailers. The part that got my hide up was they seem feel free to take the whole lot when they seem fit. WRONG.   Anyways,here endith the rant. Great weather coming and going to make the best of what ever comes our way."
372143,xkempx,2009-08-12 23:02:00,84,"Go and get some Pylons and construction tape and rope it off in the middle of the night.  Say closed for Construction from this date to that date. If they take it away, Do it again. By the time it goes back to city hall and find who the contractor is the event will be over.  Thats all.  "
372177,Dutch,2009-08-13 00:32:00,831,"Events like the ones you name bring in thousands, if not millions into the local economy.  Government knows this and that's why the events are sanctioned.  It may upset the locals to a degree, but the benefits to the local tourism trade and economy far outweight the concerns of the locals.  Ever heard of the NIMBY concept - this is it.  Not saying you are wrong, it is your opinion after all and you can't have an opinion that's incorrect."
