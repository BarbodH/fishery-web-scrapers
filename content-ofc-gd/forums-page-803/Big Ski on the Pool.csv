370835,Doctrt,2009-08-09 04:05:00,141,"Just got back from  a trip to the Pool and I think I made the right call.  I had the option to fish tomorrow aft or today aft and with the stable conditions of late and impending rain tonight, it was a no brainer.  Get to big musky water ASAP!  I hit the water around 4pm and started casting one of my favorite weedbeds with a big spinnerbait, where I had seen some big fish in the past.  Notta.  I moved over to cast a nearby island to see if I could scare up a pike or two and was again disappointed.  As the chop began to pick up a bit I decided to return to the weed flat that I had hit about an hour earlier.  I started throwing a topraider and didn't get a sniff.  I went to my old faithful, a 9"" sledge that I had landed some huge ones with, in the past. On my 5th or 6th cast I hit a small pike about 2-3lbs.  On closer examination, I realized he had some gashes on him, possibly from those big muskies.   On my first cast back to the same spot - Wham!  Big Fish!  When it got closer I realized it was very big.  Not my biggest, but very big!  After about a 10 minute fight, I slid the cradle under her and got a few quick measurements and pics.  I put her back in the cradle as I readied the camera for some holds.  You never know how they're gonna turn out when you're on your own but they didn't turn out too bad.  I took great care to ensure that she kicked away strong and I took one more underwater shot as she did.  She came out at about 53.5"" with no pinch in the tail and 23"" in girth.  Enjoy the pics.

370836,Jacques,2009-08-09 04:08:00,97,Awesome fish.  Well done!
370837,Paully,2009-08-09 04:11:00,712,That last pic makes it look like a monster! Nice fish Bud..
370841,Leecher,2009-08-09 04:21:00,7832,That is a big fat ski for sure Congratulations Doctrt Thanks for sharing those awesome pics!!! Leechman
370842,Flatbackdreamer,2009-08-09 04:21:00,17,"Nice timme, dave's a little pissed about you not calling,he was bobbing around in his belly-boat a couple of miles from you.I,m at Wills now drooling at your post,great catch and beauty shots."
370848,tonka-toy,2009-08-09 06:23:00,139,"Tim just on my way out now,all fired up after your post.I have one of your ""old faithfuls"" in the boat somewhere,I just may have to give her a good washing tomorrow.Great shots and I can't believe the bulging stomach on her.It's one thing to land a big girl like that and another to do it ""Han Solo.""Glad to hear she swam away strong too."
370855,cram,2009-08-09 09:22:00,1733,beautiful fish.  Curious - how do you use a cradle by yourself?  i find it impossible.
370879,Doctrt,2009-08-09 13:39:00,141," I made a 57"" cradle with tubing that floats and a weighted rubberized mesh.  I've got one of the tubes tied to the boat with small ropes so when I'm landing a fish, I throw it over board and steer the fish over the openning.  It's not simple but it works!"
370880,ravinerat,2009-08-09 13:45:00,64,"Zoweeeeeee, Shes a beauty. Good job on solo landing. I'd like to see some pics of your cradle.  RR"
370893,Sinker,2009-08-09 14:23:00,8692,"Nice fish for sure. I use a cradle solo too, but I can fit one side of it in my rod holders that run the side of my boat. I need one hand to hold the other side open though.......and one hand on the rod. Its tricky, but doable.  S."
370901,bassman87,2009-08-09 14:44:00,586,"Awesome catch, way to go man."
370904,Joey,2009-08-09 15:27:00,9122,"Wow, what a beauty, congrats.  Joey"
370911,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-08-09 16:01:00,0,"Well done on the solo effort, its always rewarding when your plan or decision of where and when to fish comes together with a big beautiful fish like that. I fish muskies alot and this has been my toughest year to date, took a break and fished walleyes one weekend to help build my confidence back up a little. Fish like yours and other board members only help to boost confidence even more. Thanks for the confidence booster, and congrats on the release"

370917,BillM,2009-08-09 16:20:00,17367,That thing is an absolute monster!!!!  Congrats man
370918,cram,2009-08-09 16:20:00,1733," You prefer it to a net?  I have a cradle, no musky-sized net, but was going to pick one up because so many of my trips these days are solo...."
371071,ccmtcanada,2009-08-10 01:18:00,7971,Wow...incredible looking musky!!!
371076,Wendel,2009-08-10 01:23:00,213,nice fish!
371082,lunkerbasshunter,2009-08-10 01:34:00,2585,monster musky pal!!!!!  Cheers!
371216,ehg,2009-08-10 14:22:00,2666,Real nice chunky Pool musky! It's  tough landing musky when alone.
371217,fishingisliving,2009-08-10 14:29:00,170," my craddle's handles float. no problem to do it by yourself, just have one end tied to the rod holder with a small bungie cord or something so it doesn't float away when you release the fish.  great fish!!  I would not of bothered with the measurement pictures on the bottom of the boat, you have nothing to prove to anyone, it's a big fish, nough said. but again, NICE FISH MAN!"
371287,TC1OZ,2009-08-10 18:23:00,987,Awesome catch!
371718,Doctrt,2009-08-11 20:25:00,141,"I was asked to add this on to my thread.  Tonka-toy and our buddy Davey were inspired after seeing my fish as they said above.  After only a few hours of fishing the next evening, Dave was rewarded with his new personal best, this 50"" x 23.5"" beauty.  Looks like those fish really love the prestorm bite.  This one was so big that Dave, at 6 foot 3 couldn't even look.  Kinda reminds me of the old Six Gun Justice spots from SCTV.  Congrats Boys!!  "
