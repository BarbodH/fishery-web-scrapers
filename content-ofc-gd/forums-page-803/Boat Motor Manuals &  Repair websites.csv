Thanks  Splashhopper"
370886,Fish Farmer,2009-08-09 14:07:00,2234,Thanks for posting. Would be nice if there was a Trouble shooter site. A friend has a 25 Johnson 3 cylinder. The motor is a night mare  . He has spent $1500.00 to fix it and still has the same problem  . Motor runs great for a couple hours then has no power. The mechanic's are scratching there heads  .
370892,Black_Blade,2009-08-09 14:22:00,258,  There is a great trouble shooter site for outboard motors etc The Marine Doctor  I have used this guys site several times and have recieved excellent help for an old 9 hp Viking outboard I had as well as some tips on servicing my little 3 hp Johnson.  Hope this helps.

371055,NAW,2009-08-10 00:37:00,4022,http://www.crowleymarine.com/  I don't know what your exact definition of a help site is.  The link above have a large variety of free exploded/assembly drawings tons of motors/components.  It's helped me work on my motors many times.  Not all makes are on tihs website though.
