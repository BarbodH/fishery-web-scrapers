371587,mizzmo,2009-08-11 14:06:00,30,Hello All I have rented a cottage on the mighty burnt river between Cameron Lake and Four Mile Lake (but closer to four mile).  Just wondering what fish species i might encounter or how the fishing is in this area of the river.  Thanks for now.  Mizzmo
371853,mizzmo,2009-08-12 01:33:00,30,I have read maybe some walleye but definately smallies and muskies.  Can anyone confirm this
371872,GBW,2009-08-12 02:02:00,8460,yes  I haven't found the time to drive up to the river from 4 mile lake (in the car to go fishing as we are on the warter) BUT I have a few bud's that fish is for musky all the time.  the musky are not big but DANG fast.  Might want to try North of the bridge in Kinmount too

371958,mizzmo,2009-08-12 12:58:00,30,"thanks for the replies guys, we are actually staying about 5 km south of Kinmount.  Mizzmo"

372049,mark_74,2009-08-12 18:19:00,24,Yes there is a dam in Kinmount
372112,Rich,2009-08-12 21:27:00,3927,Some of the back canals and eddies have some excellent slop fishing opportunities for big largemouth as well. Keep a scum frog tied on.
