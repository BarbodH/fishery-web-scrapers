But when the boat's in water, there's always a bit of water in the livewell.  Is there anyway I can permanently seal the connection to the lake closed?  I could put a lot of gear in there if it weren't always a bit wet."
371593,bassjnkie,2009-08-11 14:13:00,1101,I use my live well for storage most of the time. I just plug the bottom drainage hole.
371636,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-11 15:53:00,947,dunno if a wine cork will be big enough for the whole but it's worth a try and you can silicone the cork in place too
371650,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-11 16:14:00,10439,I have little plugs like the transom plug for your boat that fit my livewell drains.  Like These Ones  
371670,tomO,2009-08-11 16:56:00,363,You can go to a hardware store and get rubber stops like a cork.
371680,fishinggeek,2009-08-11 18:16:00,325,Thanks everyone.  But how do I stop water from coming in through the sprinkler if I accidentally press the livewell fill button?
371681,Bitsmith2k,2009-08-11 18:17:00,396, does the switch have a fuse?
371695,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-11 18:53:00,947,Yea i would remove the fuse unless you have 2 livewells and you just need one.  Then i would just take off the end of the spout and get a end cap at any hardware store.
371724,fishinggeek,2009-08-11 20:40:00,325,Fuse?  Brilliant!  Thanks everyone (again).  Nice to have more storage on the ship.
371758,Cast-Away,2009-08-11 22:37:00,790,Don't forget to plug the overflow hole as well. Sometimes water washes in there.
371986,fishinggeek,2009-08-12 14:06:00,325, Thanks.  Going to the plumbing section to find a plug with the same diameter and threading as the overflow.
372010,LeXXington,2009-08-12 15:52:00,1928,"I went too Home Depot and got a over size cork for mine, Works great!!  Yes I get a few laughs when people see the cork but I find the livewell is great for keeping stuff cool and dry"
372048,Spiel,2009-08-12 18:17:00,9065,My boat has two livewells and I can isolate them by turning the inflow outlet clockwise to close and counterclock wise to open. Perhaps yours is similar?
