443037,tb4me,2010-03-12 20:02:00,3295,Interesting how the damn Beaver got up on the bridge in the first place..I feel for the dude thou..I have had to beat the beaver off of me with a wrench too!!! Now thats funny! On a more serious note. I was once fishing in the Grand River here in Brantford. I was wearing my waiters and standing in about 3 to 4 foot of water. A white jig head with a white mr.Twister catchin pickerell. all of a sudden I look right beside me and there is this huge big thing swimming upstream about 4 to 5 inches from my leg..It scared the hell outta me. Yikes! as it turned out it was a beaver when I jumped it scared him too and the big dude soaked me..Not somthing your used to seeing right beside ya! wow
