HEY!!the yote ran but wasn't too concerned about my presence until i yelled.they seemed to be a little more timid not too long ago.  problem is i get a kick out of seeing anything wild while i'm flying across the 407 , deer, gosset hawks or coyotes. forget your in the city for  a minute. setting traps or snares is one way to go but it's kinda sad.  ofcourse i understand the concerns from all sides,,  but it's just another huge workboot stompin' down on another fragment of inter-city wildlife.  late night rant"

They need to run a sterilization program, or something else that enables killing (or scaring the bejeezers out of) the urban coyotes."
