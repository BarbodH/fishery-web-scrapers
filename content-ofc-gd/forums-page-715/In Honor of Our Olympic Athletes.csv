442410,Leecher,2010-03-11 02:42:00,7832," You're too much   :lol:   Thanks Shore_Lunch!!!   Thanks Doug!!!  The start of the game is from the blue ring where you see 2 arrows pointing in their respective directions, double skunk in the black and yellow as dots and skunk in the red and green rings.  The end is in the red in between the 2 arrows pointing at each other.  Certainly not your traditional looking layout but that's what I was inspired doing when I first started working on the pattern  I don't think I will add any numbers to it but will add some additional touches in the final 10% of this work Will keep you posted on that"
442411,bushart,2010-03-11 02:45:00,2628,Looks great Jacques---also looks like a lot of work---good job
442412,Leecher,2010-03-11 02:51:00,7832, Thanks Terry!!!  Yes it's a lot of work.....  going on day 4 now    and tonight decided to take a break from it.

440568,Leecher,2010-03-06 04:52:00,7832,"After seeing such an outstanding performance by our athletes, just could not pass the opportunity to make something in the work shop to honor them..... and had a good idea what I wanted to make.  Here's what I have done so far      About half done Will keep you posted on the development Leechman"
440596,tjsa,2010-03-06 11:25:00,1578,you can hang a bunch of baits from that when its done and mounted on a wall   :D  :D
440603,Radnine,2010-03-06 12:00:00,1538,"Drill a bunch of holes in it and call it Olympage or Cribbics. Nice scroll saw work (I assume). On a side note Jacques, I have never seen a guy that gets more man time than you. I am not sure how you have managed it, but good on ya! Jim"
440624,Leecher,2010-03-06 14:02:00,7832," Now there's an idea      Thanks Tom!!!   Thanks Jim!!!  Used the jigsaw for that one..... just a couple of hours     Now I got some serious sanding to do The idea of drilling a bunch of holes came to mind     but once I'm finished with the sanding part, I will proceed to the next step and..... you'll just have to wait for the final results  Thanks again Jim Jacques"
440626,Twocoda,2010-03-06 14:12:00,4130,Jacques ....you should make 14 rings together and paint them all gold...NOBODY in the world would understand it but Canadians would
440678,Leecher,2010-03-06 17:36:00,7832, Thanks Twocoda!!!  Too bad it wasn't 15...... cause that would be very possible    would only need to make another 2 of those
