442591,sandmann,2010-03-11 18:52:00,51,"With the nice weather quickly approaching its time to get fishing gear in order. How low will you let the line on your spool get before changing, spinning and casting reels? Thanks in advance for your input."
442593,xeon,2010-03-11 18:56:00,350,New line every season. During the season if it gets half way I join the two lines and top er up.
442609,mepps,2010-03-11 19:25:00,1301,All depends on the target species for me. I have a few smaller reels I typically use for bass that dont have a lot of line on em. I'm into my 3-4 season with the same spool of braid with no issue to speak of.
442618,bare foot wader,2010-03-11 19:46:00,1354,"braid is diff than mono, last a lot longer....mono def replace start of every season, if you fish a lot then replace when needed throughout the season  I generally replace mine when the spool gets low enough to affect casting distance...also a matter of personal opinion, myself I like to keep spooled up right to the lip"
442621,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-11 19:50:00,2690,"I will second that.  Also type of line, are we talking mono, braid, etc... I try to not let my line get very low at all on certain reels where I want casting distance.  For instance I use a 4000 series Shimano for chucking hardware on Lake Huron piers...you want a full spool to get that distance as the fish start moving out later in the morning."
442634,timmeh,2010-03-11 20:22:00,609,"Along with type of line, you need to consider the fish you'll be after. If it's larger fish and that can take off on longer runs you will need to have enough line that you won't get spooled."
442635,Fang,2010-03-11 20:22:00,1330,For regular mono line I really like fresh line. I change up every couple of trips  I have most of my spinning reels with about 1/2 the spool filled with backing. I like the red or yellow Raven so it's very visible. Then I fill the rest of the spool with my line weight and type needed. A simple blood knot joins the main line to my backing. I usually get up around 3 spinning reel refills out of a single spool of line so changing up is actaully more affordable for me  On reels were I might actually get into the backing once in a while I fill from a bare spool but still change at least every season  Like Mepps said some of my braid outfits are getting to be 3+ years now. I remember last year finally pulling off some 50lb Fenwick Iron Thread. Who knows how old that stuff was
442637,vinnimon,2010-03-11 20:30:00,2593,"It depends.On my regular users I replace the line religiously,Even if it sat and never been used.On that note, I do save the line and use it on my other reels,esp the ultra lights."
442715,smally21,2010-03-11 23:11:00,993,i like to keep my braid for a few years and i find reversing it gets me line that has never seen the light of day.
442772,archie_james_c,2010-03-12 01:14:00,618,"I change my line out when it gets down to 3/4 of the reels spool. That's braid or mono, and either is changed atleast once a year...line is one of the cheapest expenses an angler has, AND it's the ONLY thing keeping your next trophy fish on...why skimp?  Also get int he habit of clipping 1-3 yards of line off before every day of fishing or after catching a big toothy critter. Nothing is worse than losing a fish cuz you were too lazy to tie one measly knot!  "
442796,asdve23rveavwa,2010-03-12 02:14:00,2690,"Extremely good advice...especially the clipping of 1-3 yards before fishing...when steelheading I will clip  close to a yard after every fish above 2-3 lbs.  They aren't exactly toothy critters, but, sometimes roll in the line (like a laker) especially in colder water.  Better safe than sorry. Line and hooks are soooo important and both are relatively inexpensive in the scheme of things."
442833,archie_james_c,2010-03-12 04:20:00,618,"  You got that right Frank. I never understood guys who fish out of a 14,000$ boat or who fish with 450$ rod/reel combos being so cheap as to not keep a relatively full spool of line that costs 9-20$ or a hook that costs cents...  People...the line and hook...IS THE ONLY THING KEEPING THE FISH ON!!!"
