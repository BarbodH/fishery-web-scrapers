442949,mistaredone,2010-03-12 15:57:00,913,Last season I spent alot of time fishing a lake with a beach launch and only realised at the end of the season the damage I had done to my keel on my fiberglass boat.    Im looking at getting a keel guard for this season and was wondering if I should repair the keel before aplying the keel guard?  Also I was wondering if anyone had a cheeper solution they have used rather than buying a Keel Shield at bass pro for $140.  The price seems crazy of 6' of sticky plastic.  Thanks

442965,Gerry,2010-03-12 16:33:00,257,"If you're beaching a fiberglass boat you do need a keel guard/keel shield. The keel guard is the more expensive version but can't tell you why. I've always had a keel guard on my glass boats. I'm not sure if the keel needs to be repaired as the guard will actually cover that area. I do know that they should be professionally installed, they use some special glues to keep them fastened. I had one come loose on a bassboat and the dealer didn't want to touch it, they got a company rep fix it."

442974,lew,2010-03-12 17:01:00,12766,"I went with the Keel Shield when I bought my new glass boat last year and so far I'm very happy with it. Fortunately I don't normally have to beach my boat, but I spend alot of time on both Stoney and the West Bay of Nippissing so it's nice to know it'll be there if I ever accidentely troll across one of those unseen islands  Very easy to install as long as you follow the instructions EXACTLY and do it on a warm day.  I bought mine from Genco Marine on the Toronto waterfront.  http://www.gencomarine.com/"
