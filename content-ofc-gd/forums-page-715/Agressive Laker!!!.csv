442663,vinnimon,2010-03-11 21:20:00,2593,"Dont worry about it T J, keep the vids coming.   We had a discussion at TYLERS TOURNEY about me wanting to set up something while downriggen., and how to do it, thats all."
442732,TJQ,2010-03-11 23:48:00,7806, LOL.. I get ya.. I do know that the camera companies usually have clips to put the camera on the downrigger cables!!
442753,Leecher,2010-03-12 00:15:00,7832,Awesome footage TJ      Aggressive fish for sure Did you eventually get a hook up with it?? Leechman
442754,camillj,2010-03-12 00:21:00,1988,I actually drag mine backwards from the tail piece (like when Ice fishing) ... and I drilled a hole in the lead weights and attached a great big rigger release ... that way I can clip my leade line/ lure to the release and watch it while I am trolling ... having said that I am not sure how to make a video (unless I just use a camcorder  and plug it into the monitor (never tried that yet) ...  Anyhow ... the first thing that comes to mind TJ is for goodness sake .. SHARPEN THOSE HOOKS!  Great video bud !
442758,TJQ,2010-03-12 00:30:00,7806,"LOL.. I dont think I landed it...  I was doing a bunch of pike video on Shoal Lake, and I actually wound up taking the hooks off the baits cause i got sick of having to take the fish off....   anyway more to come over the next month or two while I redo everything."
