442470,Roy,2010-03-11 11:37:00,13728,"I first met Jack several years ago at Beans and Maribeth's house on Pigeon Lake. It was a great visit and I had a wonderful time with the likes of Big Cliff, Pigeon Fisher, Lew and of course Jack. Well, on the 7th of this month I received an email from Jack which read:  Hi Roy, Been having a problem with backaches since  mid January. I mentoin this to my Eurologist, who immediately sent me for a  Catscan.It shows that my Cancer is on the move again and got into my Pelvic and  lower backbone. Hence the aching.Apparently it built up an immunity to the drug  I've been having for 2 yrs. Apparently, people with this kind of cancer have an  average of 2-3yrs as there is no cure as yet. I go for a bonescan on Mon. then on to chemo to  slow it down a bit. Sorry to load you up with this, but thought I'd let  you know befor the 'grapevine' started up LOL, Hope all is well at your end, see you at  L'air. Jack  I didn't post this to the board out of respect for Jack and Jackie's need for privacy. I've since been forwarded an email from Beans (Norm) and here it is:  Norm, I dont mind who you want to tell about me, the more it's in the open the easier to handle. Never did like secrets LOL. I was going to put it on the 'Board, but  did'nt want anyone think i'm looking for sympathy. Ah well, crap happens. As an update; after reading up on Chemo and getting lots of info from the hospital, I've [we] have decided NOT to go thro' with the Chemo. I'm told it wont cure it, only slow it down. With all the negatives, destroying good blood cells, open to any infections going around, weakness, tiredness [ sounds like HIV dont it] and on a 3 week cycle for the rest of my natural, we dont think its worth it. Sooner live a short time having fun, than a bit longer being miserable. There is another Hormone treatment thay we have to talk with the Doctor about, so we will go from there. Not the best of new's but we will make the best of it. Will you pass this along to Cliff as he wants to be kept up to date. Cant wait for the soft water fishing to start again TTYL.........Jack  So, whether you know Nanook or not, please, please offer a prayer to help him and Jackie get through this. If you don't pray, no worries, a positive thought will go a long way to making things better for them.  Jack, please know that I will help in any way I can to help you through this. I'm having trouble with words here Jack. Just know that your extended family will do what they can.  Be well.  Roy  And yes, I WILL see you at Lakair in June."
