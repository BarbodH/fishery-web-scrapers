442189,Syn,2010-03-10 17:41:00,519,"hey, lets not talk about flouro by making a thread called ""Fluorocarbon Advantages""  This thread makes perfect sense if you totally disregard logic.   edit: Thread hijack! Just cause 2 demo is out and its soooo much fun http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c51eL5l9g6E&"
442192,rock34,2010-03-10 17:52:00,215,"This thread makes absolutly NO sense.  If you dont want to talk about it then my best advice is dont click on the thread titled ""Flourocarbon vs. mono"".  Clearly some people find it informative."
442193,cheaptackle,2010-03-10 17:53:00,849,"  Would that also include braid, musky baits, limited budget for pike lures, knots, and oh I dunno, anything to do with exchanging ideas about the hardware involved?  And that was the SHORT list.... LOTS to learn from on this board, and a great place to find answers.  I for one don't mind if I look like a real greenhorn when asking, and I certainly do find a lot to consider from ALL the posts, keep 'em coming!  Michael"
442196,highdrifter,2010-03-10 17:58:00,2534,This question is way too general..  Narrow it down a tad and explain your intended application.
442292,archie_james_c,2010-03-10 23:00:00,618,I see some guys don't share the same sense of humour. I apologize to the line junkies   I demand you all go and fondle your favourite Float Rod/Jiggin stick/baitcaster PRONTO!
