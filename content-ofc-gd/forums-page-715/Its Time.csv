Has anyone had much luck yet, I was out a few days ago for an hour and managed to catch one and also had a follow. It was great to get out after that long winter we had (joke). One thing I noticed is the water levels being really low, I wonder how thats gonna effect the fishing, I have a few fav spots I like to fish on sunny days where the pike come in and take in the sun, this year there almost too shallow, looks like Ill have to explore and find some new spots. To the people who have had the chance to get out there, what has been your lure of choice?"
