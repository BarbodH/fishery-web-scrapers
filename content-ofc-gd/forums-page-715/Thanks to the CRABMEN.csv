443126,Fang,2010-03-13 00:23:00,1330,Aw Brian you had to mention that. Looks like a trip to Fortinos in the morning. I hate getting these cravings. Worst part is my son eats as much as I do with this stuff so it's double the price. I think I can still get 2 pounds of king crab for $18. Oh what the heck it's a four pound night and maybe I'll even splurge for name brand beer as the leafs will extend the winning streak  Dynasty of the future Stahlberg Caputi  That's just pitiful!
