441058,kuhaman,2010-03-07 18:13:00,503,I want to take my boy ice fishing for a few days during the march break and Im having a hard time finding a spot . We would like to fish for walleye and need a cottage and hut. Everything in southern ontario is closed for walleye but I dont mind driving 6 to 8 hours if thats what it takes. Any suggestions?

Suspect they're pulling up lakers/whities and 'eyes.. depending on the time of day. Motel style accoms, or cabins.. and they drive you out to the huts each day (or you could drive out yourself if you have a truck). Tell them the nut job, with the green and white airplane parked across from their docks, sent ya...  www.temagamishores.com"

I'd go with Wayne's recommendation, cause I would need the exact same help if I were down that way during that time frame. Whether or not you have success is always a gamble, but I believe you will catch fish."
441094,kuhaman,2010-03-07 19:32:00,503,"Thanks Irishfield, I'll send them an email. I thought zone 11 was closed on the 15th, man I gotta read the regs more often. Any walleye tips"
441098,irishfield,2010-03-07 19:34:00,26272,"Was last year... because of 3rd Sunday... the 1st was a Sunday unfortunately..ending the season on the 15th.  Wish I had time to go up again myself...  Warm weather hasn't been an issue so far.. -12's at night... but long range might make it iffy for travel, but T Shores will get you out there as the ice will still be thick and they have a sun sheltered shoreline to get onto the ice."
