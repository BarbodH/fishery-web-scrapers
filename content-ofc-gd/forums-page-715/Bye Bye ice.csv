The funniest was a wee 10"" pike pretending he was a muskie.  Went to check it out this morning and most of the shoreline had broken up. My buddy Bill got out with his spud to test a few spots. The hard 10-12 inches is now an opaque soft green and the spud goes through with 4-5 whacks. With the rains coming there won't be any safe ice in Niagara"
