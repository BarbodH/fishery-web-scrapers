442971,scuro2,2010-03-12 16:52:00,904,"My wife said that she heard on the news that the 70 year old man had a headshot wound and that there was another officer in the police car who fired the fatal shot that eventually killed the man. I heard on the radio that this was a ""domestic dispute"". The man had recently separated from his wife. Not to much to wonder about here. Domestic disputes are very dangerous calls for police officers and it is a tragedy for all of society that some men simply can't let go and move on when their spouse no longer wants to be in a relationship."
443028,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-12 19:37:00,348,"The worst call for any police officer to go to is anything that is domestic related, because you never know what can happen.  The fact this guy had a loaded rifle in his vehicle should tell you something about him.....  You're nothing but a bleeding heart and have absolutely no clue what you are talking about.   "
443068,jonnybass,2010-03-12 21:35:00,346, Nice.
443081,irishfield,2010-03-12 22:06:00,26272, He was pretty nice.. considering where his wife works!
443173,fishing n autograph,2010-03-13 01:44:00,2540,Amen!  The old man brought a rifle to his ex wife's house...do you think he was looking for trouble?  It looks more like suicide by cop than anything else. But regardless of his mental state what he did was wrong and three young children lost their father. That is my biggest fear everyday I go to work.  I feel bad because I was not able to attend the funeral. I did go to the funeral of the Peel Officer.  Its been a real bad month in Ontario for coppers...3 dead is a tragedy...
443175,vinnimon,2010-03-13 01:55:00,2593,My heart goes out to the officer and his family.  May God rest your soul in peace.
441466,NAW,2010-03-08 20:16:00,4022,"An OPP officer was shot in the head this morning around 10:00am just north of Winthrop (about an hour north of London)..  They have not released his name, but said he was air lifted to a hospital in London where he is in grave condition.  Supposedly he has been on the force for some 20 years.  This happened only a short distance from my hometown where I was raised, so it hit close to home.  Lets all hope the officer survives this disaster..  Though it really doesn't sound good.  The gunman was hit in the gunfight, but is not in as suvere condition as the officer..  There will be a press conference today at 4:00."
441510,Big Cliff,2010-03-08 22:53:00,6899,"A very sad day indeed! I sure hope he makes it, I understand he has 3 young boys. A prayer for the whole family!"
441517,lew,2010-03-08 23:05:00,12766,The news reports now that the officer has died of his injuries.....so sad
441518,irishfield,2010-03-08 23:07:00,26272,Sad to hear Lew! OFC is always ahead of the news.. just reported 30 seconds ago still in critical condition.
441519,duxbware,2010-03-08 23:08:00,102,He just past away. My thoughts and prayers are with with family and his OPP family.
441526,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-03-08 23:20:00,1362,Terrible news...he was a father of 3 children and on the force for 15yrs....his assailant is a 70yr old male who is in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound

441665,skeeter,2010-03-09 04:13:00,1907,this is very sad 3 young boys now without there father a wife without her husband   and a 70 year old man that will get a suspended sentence because of his age-- ( if that even )
441669,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-09 04:17:00,0,things were pretty somber today around our place  after hearing of this.  kept checking the news today for updates. very sad news for sure.

Hit's very close to home for us, our son-in-law and his brother are both OPP's, one in Markdale and one in Walkerton. Can't imagine what this HERO""S family must be feeling, can only envision our daughter and grandkids and what they face daily when he ""goes to work"" God bless them and thank them for their service to us.!"
441913,bare foot wader,2010-03-09 21:56:00,1354,"when I first read of this online and saw his picture I thought he looked very familiar....then I read this later on:  ""He was an avid hunter and fisherman, and he always had his boys with him doing outdoor things with them. They were involved in hockey and soccer and whenever you saw them, they were always together,"" she said.  I believe I may have chatted with him for a few mins on the maitland last season, he was a stand up guy, shared some info on the bite....  very sad loss, my condolences to his family and friends   has anybody read anything further as to what caused the old man to start shooting?"

The globe and mail is flushing out details tonight on the 70 year old man. More here. http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/nation...article1495642/
442090,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-10 04:56:00,348,"What is truly dispicable is that the newspapers are already putting their own ""twist"" on it by continuing to report the piece of crap (I don't care how old he is) as an ""elderly suspect"" in the newspapers as if to draw sympathy because of his age. Makes me want to vomit.  I'll most likely be attending the funeral, which will probably be on friday. RIP."
442150,fishing n autograph,2010-03-10 14:37:00,2540,"Another hero lost this week and my third police funeral in the last few months.  I will be honoured to march in the memory of PC Pham.  He was a local guy who grew up in Elmira. A friend of mine went to school with him and said he was one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.  Heroes in life, not death."
442161,NAW,2010-03-10 15:41:00,4022,"I was raised in Wingham, however moved away for school before Officer Pham came to town.  I know lots of people who know him.  Everyone says he was an incredible man and father.  I have never heard any bad words about him.  The population of Wingham is going to triple the day of the funeral..  (If they have the funeral in Wingham)"

I have to admit, I'm a little torn on what to think about his death.  The rest of his life in prison, or him being killed?  I would never wish death on anyone, but what this guy did what horrible.."
442844,waterwolf,2010-03-12 06:00:00,556,an incredible tragedy.  report with some sensitvity.
442853,jonnybass,2010-03-12 10:20:00,346,"RIP to both men who died. Tragic.  I don't know all of the facts involved, none of us do, so I have mixed emotions.  We don't know for certain which of these men, who by all accounts were good human beings, were in the wrong here.  I caution those who would blindly support either individual to wait until the facts of this case are brought to public light. Police are not incapable of wrong-doing, nor are artists/politicians."
442862,Fishnwire,2010-03-12 11:13:00,983,"  Who knows all the detals of what happened?  No one will.  What really sucks is that a working person died while on the job.  No matter what you do for a living, you'd almost certainly rather be somewhere else than at work...to go in and do your job and not be able to go home at the end of the day is a tradegy.  I hope it doesn't turn out that something could have been done to avoid this tradegy, but if that's the case it won't make it less of one."
