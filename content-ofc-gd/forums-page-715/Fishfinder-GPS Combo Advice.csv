442567,Gutpile,2010-03-11 17:44:00,27,I'm looking at buying a new fishfinder/GPS combo for my Crestliner 1750 Fishhawk.  I'm looking at either a Lowrance HDS5 or a Hummingbird 788ci.  What would you recommend and why.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Then, compare both units. And yes, they are almost the same.  Personally I've used the Hbird 1100SI series, 900SI series, 700 series, and 500 series in action on the water. I've played with a demo HDS, but haven't seen the HDS on the water... YET. I've used a bunch of the ""older"" lowrance LMS 520c, 110c, ect. on the water for most of last years season. Now that lowrance is releasing its new down+side imaging its pretty much the same as the hbirds as they too now have down imaging standard on their SI units.  The sonar capabilities of the units will be roughly the same. The down and side imaging should also NOT be purchased for a 5'' unit as you wont be able to see enough detail. At the end of the day, these units are so similar it pretty much comes down to price. Also don't let the ""HD"" thing fool you, its pretty much just a marketing gimmick, theres higher resolution on the birds.  Heres one on the HDS 5 and 700 http://www.walleyecentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=160441 Heres an ok discussion between the HDS8 and 900 series humminbird. http://www.walleyecentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=162672  What am I buying for this season? I have absolutely no idea yet and I've been researching the units for about 3 months straight."
442597,scugpg,2010-03-11 19:00:00,1373,Lots of info on this subject but I'd personally go with an HDS 5 or HDS7. Really like the screen detail & resolution of the units and features have been extremely happy with my older Lowrance so far.
442599,troutologist,2010-03-11 19:02:00,951,"I would argue that the sonar on the Lowrance is sharper. I've had both units in my boat last year.  That said I'm leaning back to the HB because of customer service and having everthing in in one, no add ons required.  For the money the 898si seems like a very good unit.  The split screen on the HDS 5 is small and makes it tough to read."

442706,Big Cliff,2010-03-11 22:47:00,6899,I have an HDS5 and love it!
