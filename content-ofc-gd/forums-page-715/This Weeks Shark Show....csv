I had no idea we had such a wicked fishery (sharkery?) right here in Canada and I can tell you I'm going back again for sure.... With or without Dave!  Enjoy the rest of your week guys - Hopefully this weather holds out for the weekend!  Cheers, Ryan"

442536,The Urban Fisherman,2010-03-11 15:52:00,2050,"UflyFish,  Just make sure you listen to Captain Art and follow his rules for not getting sea sick.  I DIDN'T and had a few wobbly pops the night before which resulted in this right at the end of our day out on the ocean...    "
