442421,Fisherman,2010-03-11 03:10:00,7201,I'm making another fish finder box and am looking to purchase a some closed cell foam anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.  Anyone have any idea where to get it? Thanks.
442426,cheaptackle,2010-03-11 03:19:00,849,Check Kijiji for a start. Then Fabricland (don't ask!) Upholstery shops probably be your best bet (auto or furniture)  Michael
442432,Fisherman,2010-03-11 03:30:00,7201,Fabricland..like the sewing shop? Will call them then tomorrow.
442435,cheaptackle,2010-03-11 03:38:00,849,"aaaarrrrgggghhhhhh!  Yes, the sewing place! Also a good place to buy (or it was at one time) different vinyls and other materials. Good Luck!  Michael"
442444,Gerritt,2010-03-11 03:55:00,6129,to line a box? Would SM help? you can find it @ just about any hardware (ie. home depot etc) store...
442455,carp-starter,2010-03-11 06:49:00,253,"Fisherman, I will soon use closed cell foam. But I do not know if my foam is the same type that you would use and need.  I fly tie and foam is one of the materials that can be used – I have so far not tied a foam fly.  But I have bought 4 sheets.  There are 2 places where foam can be bought.  It is sold at the dollar store or at Michaels or at other craft stores.  Foam that fly tiers use starts at about 1/8 inch to whatever. I was not aware that they come in ½ inch thick. Foam that I would buy comes in sheets.  As word gets out, more and more American tiers buy their materials at the craft stores because the cost is a fraction of the cost at fly shops.  carp-starter"
442485,Fisherman,2010-03-11 13:00:00,7201,"Yes, going to line the F/F box with it, that stuff is a pretty good shock absorbing material and it doesn't absorb a lot of water."
442514,Fang,2010-03-11 14:52:00,1330,"Head to a dollarama and go down the summer aisle. They sell 2 items for the summer thant might help you. They have a thin closed cell foam bed roll for camping. I think it's a bout 1/4-1/2 thick. Also in the gardening area they have a 8""x14"" kneeling pad for working in the garden. It's about 1"" thick and I've used a few of these just re4cently to lock in my fish finder battery inot my small cooler so it doesn't bounce around.  You also might find small swim boards there too."
442547,Fisherman,2010-03-11 16:30:00,7201,"Tried Fabricland, they don't stock any anymore up here, the thin camp mat or hunt seat might be next, Dollarama, next stop down the road."
442563,HTHM,2010-03-11 17:15:00,4082,"Heck, cover the fish finder with plastic and shoot some ""Great Stuff"" in the box. It will mould to the the Fish Finder perfectly."
