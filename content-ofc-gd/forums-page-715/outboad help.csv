442487,west lake charlie,2010-03-11 13:12:00,40,My 2stroke  6hp Mariner Kicker motor has a constant discharge that looks like chocolate milk. I was told to use a quality oil and have switched to johnson oil and still have the discharge. The motor runs fine though.  Anybody ever had a similar problem? 
442497,scugpg,2010-03-11 13:56:00,1373,I would guess you have a seal leaking somewhere? You should get it looked at that's probably oil going right into the water.
442551,Fisherman,2010-03-11 16:38:00,7201,"That's part of the pollution that 2 strokes make, just unburned oil from the gas mix rising to the surface.  You will see it in the barrel because you not ""getting away from it"" like in the lake when moving.   Get yourself some high quality synthetic like Amsoil Saber 100:1 premix or HP Injector for 50:1.  CTC carries some, other Motorsports shops carry it to.  virtually no plug fouling and clean running engine.  BTW, Johnson doesn not make oil, they buy it from whomever and put their own lable on the containers."
442556,Spiel,2010-03-11 16:44:00,9065," Yep, just unburnt 2 stroke oil. My old 76 Johnson was just like that. I switched to a quality (supposedly) smokeless oil, I believe it was Johnson brand and ran it a little leaner than 50-1. Wasn't perfect but it was a lot better."
442576,boatman,2010-03-11 18:19:00,350,+3 for synthetic oil. Don't change the mix ratio. Stay with 50:1 and use Amsoil HPI. I've used a few synthetic oils in my antique outboards and its my favourite.
442720,smally21,2010-03-11 23:22:00,993,i've run a zilliion different two strokes and have never seen a discharge like that.  no idea what it is but it can't be normal.  look at the thick soup in the barrel.  if all two strokes ran like that you'd be getting chased by the sea shepherd!!!
442724,lew,2010-03-11 23:39:00,12766,"Back in '99 I bought a brand new 6 HP Merc 2 stroke to use as a kicker and it did the exact same thing, spewing out that filthy brown slimey mess. I've owned quite a few 2 stroke motors over the years but never saw anything like that mess before.  I took it back to the dealer and was told it was perfectly normal. I only kept that motor for one year then got rid of it."
442730,glen,2010-03-11 23:47:00,2641,Is everyone here seeing the tan coloured oil coming out from the exhaust just below the cowl?  What is it and where is it coming from?
442734,irishfield,2010-03-11 23:49:00,26272,I'd suspect a cracked head.. water/oil washing cylinder and going out exhaust.
442739,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-11 23:58:00,10439,Do a compression check on it and I think you'll find you have one cylinder low on compression due to a cracked head as irishfield suggests. Also pull the plugs and lets have a look at them. The double double Tim's look is not a good thing.
442744,glen,2010-03-12 00:05:00,2641,I can barely remember a problem i had with an old evenrude one time.  I saw oil that colour and it was from the lower unit. It may be leaking though the drive shaft seal and coming out the exhaust.
442747,Bernie,2010-03-12 00:11:00,3190,Yep.....It appears like that one has a bad head gasket. Water is entering the combustion chamber and is mixing up water oil and gasoline like whipped cream.
442759,Bigfisherman,2010-03-12 00:37:00,100,"Also if you winterized it last year using fogger oil usually after you start it for the first time it spews out that extra oil. just a thought, if it still does it then could be something else."
442851,west lake charlie,2010-03-12 08:19:00,40,"I may look into the head gasket.  The seals in the bottom end are fine, there was no water when I changed it last fall.  thanks for your help"
442891,llpp,2010-03-12 13:18:00,30,"Did you use different plugs, use the ones specified to engine,might not be running hot enough ,, and the oil is a problem also,, good luck,"
442917,BITEME,2010-03-12 14:35:00,1968,Discharge......Penicillian
