442462,SlowPoke,2010-03-11 09:09:00,2984,Some call it a bad day but think of it this way; You were able to be at your friends side when he needed you most and you able to protect a stranger when she needed you most. It says a lot about a man. Pretty good day in my opinion.
442463,Big Cliff,2010-03-11 09:44:00,6899,"You were there when a friend needed you most! You saved another man's life, and you prevented a person you didn't even know from being beaten by some jerk.  Any one of those things would make it a trying day for me.  I am so sorry for the loss of your friend but happy to hear that he had someone like you by his side when it was his time to leave. His body may be gone but his spirit will be with you for the rest of your life.  Congratulations on saving one if not two more lives that very same day. I am really looking forward to meeting you some day soon. I'd like to buy you a beer!"
442465,Spiel,2010-03-11 11:00:00,9065,Indeed a very trying day Randy but you can be proud that you faced it with both compassion and courage!  My condolences on the loss of your friend.

442841,Muskieman,2010-03-12 05:13:00,2472,"There was a blind girl who hated herself because she was blind. She hated everyone, except her loving boyfriend. He was always there for her. She told her boyfriend, 'If I could only see the world, I will marry you.'   One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her. When the bandages came off, she was able to see everything, including her boyfriend.   He asked her,'Now that you can see the world, will you marry me?' The girl looked at her boyfriend and saw that he was blind. The sight of his closed eyelids shocked her. She hadn't expected that. The thought of looking at them the rest of her life led her to refuse to marry him.   Her boyfriend left in tears and days later wrote a note to her saying: 'Take good care of your eyes, my dear, for before they were yours, they were mine.'  This is how the human brain often works when our status changes. Only a very few remember what life was like before, and who was always by their side in the most painful situations.  Life Is a Gift  Today before you say an unkind word - Think of someone who can't speak.  Before you complain about the taste of your food - Think of someone who has nothing to eat...  Before you complain about your husband or wife - Think of someone who's crying out to GOD for a companion.  Today before you complain about life - Think of someone who went too early to heaven..  Before whining about the distance you drive Think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet.  And when you are tired and complain about your job - Think of the unemployed, the disabled, and those who wish they had your job.  And when depressing thoughts seem to get you down - Put a smile on your face and think: you're alive and still around..   My brother sent me this as an E-Mail  after I told him my story.   Thanks again guys!!!!!!  RFS "

442299,Muskieman,2010-03-10 23:10:00,2472,"I work as a caregiver for Community Living West Nipissing.  Today I was working at the hospital caring for an 'Ol Pal who was very sick with liver failure.  At 10:55 this morning the nurses an I made him comfortable in bed.  A few minutes later I noticed that he was gonna check out... I followed protocol by pressing the bell button and following the list of ""must calls"" including the priest.... he had a DNR order so the nurses nor I  could do a thing.  I then made my friend comfortable and climbed in bed and layed along side him, hugged him and held his hand 'til his last breath... my old pal passed away in my arms this morning at 11:15.  Shortly thereafter my manager showed up to relieve me for a bit and give me some ""Me"" time... I walked the hallway for a few minutes... @ about 11:35 a ""code"" went off at the hospital 2 doors down from where I was working... I assisted a Nurse to perform CPR on a 62 years old man... He'll make it  Then @ 12:50 on the corner of Russell and Coursol.. I stopped domestic violence dead in it's tracks.. I witnessed a guy slap his G/F Wife in the face and push her to the ground..I slammed on my brakes and jumped out of my truck and charged towards him..  I literally picked him up and bodyslammed him onto the street and dragged him to the shoulder of Coursol Rd .I said/roared "" Stay the   down or I'll make ya stay the   down It's your choice Man!"" He had no clue what kind of mood I was in or what had just hit him for that matter. The police were there in less that 15 seconds..  Turns out that this had been going on for over 10 minutes a Russell street resident had already called the police, they were on their way and the caller was still on the line with them when I showed up.  They quickly tossed him into the cruiser.. while the victim walked home with a neighbor.  I got a big kiss and a hug from the victim and a handshake from a couple of Cops.  Appreciate every minute you have and be nice to others!!!!  My wife and kids all got big hugs when they got home  even the dogs.  I am now drinking a beer and relaxing.  Randy.  "

442391,rob v,2010-03-11 02:06:00,535,Sounds like a day you'll remember for a long time.  You were a good friend to a couple of people today.   Regardless of what the bum does or doesn't do through the courts you did what you needed to do.  At least you gave him  a choice and restrained yourself from doing more.  You probably did what lots of us hoped/wished we would do in a situation like that  Good on ya.

Nobody is ever prepared for such things and nothing can be more gut-wrenching than to have your hands tied when you are unsure what the right thing to do is. But most importantly  - you were there.  As for the other scenario - hats off for reacting to the the situation as many of us would - come what may .... and hopefully your actions will be supported by both the victim and the law.  As for it being the most trying day of your life ... I hope it was... sounds like you deserve  not just a beer but the good Karma that comes with doing the right thing when it matters.
442407,vinnimon,2010-03-11 02:36:00,2593,"They may ask him to join the force!!!!!!Assault charge?Maybe, but I dont think it will ever stick,esp if an officer is shaking his hand.Way back when, myself and others have been in similiar situations and handed the purp over to the officers.There have been some brusing and whatnots, all in all we were doing the community a favour as well as the hwpd.Never a charge laid on us.My bud even ran a guy down with his dirtbike.Never a charge.I do recall working in a variety store and some nimbrod tried to rob me,little to knowledge,The lot was mine and my friends hang out.I did a twirl with my hand and the so called robber couldnt leave the store.I gave him 2 options, me or the door.I told him the front door was less harmfull(ten guys waiting and 1 mad chick).I had a bat and some."
