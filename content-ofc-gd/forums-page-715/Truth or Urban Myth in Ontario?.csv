442186,cisco,2010-03-10 17:34:00,597,"IMO the OMNR should be called in and with the evidence/police testimony use the new hunting harrassment law to address the issue. I'm not sure whether a fine structure is in place to support this relatively new legislation, but by simply being charged the media will become interested and hopefully will expose the neighbour for the buffoon he is and this should affect his political aspirations.  If the local CO is unwilling/unsure/unable to assist then call the head office in Peterborough and speak to the head of enforcement to get the ball....and chain... rolling."
442198,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-10 18:06:00,0,"Marty....I think you have a  little backwards when it comes to posting No hunting on a property. If a property is posted 'no hunting' it can be designated as a no hunting area by the mnr. If no hunting is posted to keep hunters out then yes, the owner can't hunt it either. It's best to post the property every 25 yards with 'no trespassing'. Harassing someone while they are hunting is a NO NO..Even the MNR will not bug someone when they are hunting. Its not safe. hunting accidents happen..  . Have buddy charged. I'm sure your friend can make up a charge and have it stick.   Two against one and law enforcement usually works..."
442202,Dusky,2010-03-10 18:15:00,310,"Perhaps, you can invite Dick Cheney for a hunting trip at your friends property."
442204,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-10 18:22:00,348,"Some good points fellas....and for the record.....whether its a red dot or not is irrelevant. If a landowner posts No Hunting and/or No Tresspassing signs on his property, they and anybody he gives permission to can still hunt that property. The posting is for other hunters/peoples/tresspassers, not for the landowner. Think about it. This was confirmed by the CO's, as well as the Crown Attorney a few days ago. It's an Urban Myth....."
442207,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-10 18:28:00,0,"Another regulation ambiguity.....lol..I was told other wise....  I was also told that the OMNR could make it a no hunting area  knowing it was posted ""NO HUNTING""....My buddy didnt end up posting no hunting signs but instead posted the hell out of the property making it very clear that there was no tresspassing..."
442209,irishfield,2010-03-10 18:29:00,26272,Now did you ever get WRITTEN permission.. from the guy with the no tresspassing signs on his property.. to hunt !
442213,Dara,2010-03-10 18:46:00,3052,  I believe on Manitoulin Island you have to carry written permission from the landowner. There was talk of doing that here on St Joeseph Island as well
442245,irishfield,2010-03-10 20:19:00,26272,"I was razin Marty for hunting on my posted land Dara! ... but I always thought you needed written permission, to present if questioned by a CO, when not hunting on Crown Land."
442250,Harrison,2010-03-10 20:43:00,2202,"I used to sign a ""permission"" form to hunt a piece of private property.  It actually was a tool I could use if I ran into other hunters who were tresspassing.  It was also written that they were in no way liable for any injury or accident on their property.  Added piece of mind for them."
442315,irishfield,2010-03-10 23:44:00,26272, OFAH has the exact form you mention Phil... I have a couple on my fridge for guys I've given permission to hunt our property. It's a two way thing.. gives the hunter a copy to show authorities/others that they have permission to be there.. and gives the landowner a copy to state the hunters name and when they can hunt and what they have permission to hunt for on said property.
442322,Terry,2010-03-10 23:56:00,14456,I was told that if no hunting signs are posted then no one not even the owner could hunt and even if you take the signs down you can not hunt the property for the rest of the year or season
442418,richyb,2010-03-11 03:06:00,774,"Yep, if theres no hunting signs even the land owner cant hunt his own property."
442419,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-11 03:07:00,348,"Ha Ha....   I have recording of your voice giving me permission  Andy, certainly if the landowner posts his land no hunting, with the intent that there actually be no hunting, the mnr, in conjunction with the landowner can then declare the land no hunting. But, a landowner who hunts his own property, who puts up a no hunting sign in order to keep other people out, can still do whatever he likes with his own property.  "
442430,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-11 03:27:00,0,Well then there are two MNR officers contradicting each other...  How come that doesn't surprise me?... I thought I was taught that in the hunting course I took years ago as well.....
442431,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-11 03:30:00,348,Andy....you may not remember the exact wording....that was back in ur younger days when things were a little hazy
442436,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-11 03:39:00,348,"  Okay than! Crown Attorney must be wrong:) After all they're the ones who make the decision to prosecute, not the CO's....but what do they know, eh?"
442441,irishfield,2010-03-11 03:51:00,26272,"If the land is posted no tresspassing.. or no hunting.. in either case the land owner has to request for the charge to be laid.. as it is his land, not the crowns. Can't see anyone laying the charge against themselves!!!  However.. I do understand that down east New Brunswick way.. no hunting means just that to fish and wildlife officers "
442442,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-11 03:53:00,348,That's what I'm talking about!  I think PEI is the other province that this applies to.  It does not apply to ontario.
442445,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-11 03:57:00,0,It's hazy now! Everything was clear back then.... But then you'd know the feeling.   Don't get me goin about CO's or Crown attorneys now.....
443053,fish-miester,2010-03-12 20:42:00,864,its against the law to interfere with some one hunting or to try and scare away any animals from a hunter.. ontop of that theres vandalism.. there for if I was you i'd set up a few bush cams. and try and catch him in the act
441998,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-10 00:30:00,348,"There are people out there that believe the following:   When a landowner posts the red circles (no hunting / no trespassing) on their property.....   .....that not even the landowner or anyone he has given permission.......   .....is allowed to hunt.   Thought I would post this, because one of my good friends is having problems with his neighbour (P3TA activist), who is 100 percent against hunting. My friend has 150 acres and utlizes this property primarily for hunting. This neighbour (who is running for mayor) harasses them constantly, takes their pictures, films them every time they go into the property. He also has been banging pots and pans, broken tree stands and ladders, but has yet to be ""caught"". Because he cannot prevent them from hunting, he  stooping to this new level saying that the deer that they harvested in december, were ""poached"" (on his own property) because he posted ""No Hunting"" on it.  Funny thing was....the police had to actually research it and finally figured it out.....there was no basis to that argument and that these postings are intended for trespassers, not landowners and the people they give permission to.  Some activists are just insane I guess!!"
442004,Sinker,2010-03-10 00:34:00,8692,"Red dots mean no tresspassing, not no hunting.  I'll post my land any way I want, and I""ll do whatever I want on it too. I would be in touch with local authorities regarding a neighboor who is harrassing me, and interferring with lawful hunting. If the guy is taking pictures and video, that's almost stalking isn't it? I would be over there having words with him for sure, that's total Bull, and I wouldn't have any part of it.  S."
442007,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-10 00:40:00,10439,"  Yep, and if he ever came on my land he would be pushing up daisies!!!!"
442012,xeon,2010-03-10 00:43:00,350,"  Just set up a treestand in the neighbors view and hide a couple trail cams that are chained to a tree. If he takes one step on the property he's trespassing and can be charged. If he is caught damaging anything he can also be charged and it will look terrible on him as mayor.  Just have your friend say this to your neighbor ""Now I'm not sure if it is you that is going on my property, but I'm setting up 10 of my new wireless BuckEye trail cams up sometime next week that have the ability to send pictures directly to my computer. So if you do trespass illegally on my property your picture is going to be sent directly to my pc before you can even destroy the camera. And there WILL be charges laid.""  I doubt you'll have a problem after that talk, even if it is just a big bluff."
442016,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-10 00:50:00,4399,There are people out there you would just like to smack wouldn`t you!!!  I like the trail cam idea!!
442018,TJQ,2010-03-10 00:58:00,7806,Yup... cheapo game cameras everywhere are the way to go!
442021,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-10 01:14:00,348,"They've tried everything to get this guy to stop....one of the guys who maintains the property is a copper....and even he can't do anything about the picture taking and video's....  The reason why i posted this, was because when I had talked to some people they actually thought that if a landowner posted no hunting, that they couldn't even hunt it.  I did a little research and in fact in two provinces to our east, that IS actually the case. Crazy isn't it?"
442024,xeon,2010-03-10 01:26:00,350, Time for an ol' fashion ass kicking.
442026,MJL,2010-03-10 01:30:00,2427,"Trail cam idea is neat.  One thing to consider is to ensure that whatever pictures the cam takes involves your property and your property only if you plan on using it for photo evidence.  You may violate constitutional privacy rights otherwise.  I’m certainly no lawyer but I remember a case last year of a mother and daughter who set up a surveillance camera in their backyard – I believe it was somewhere in St. Catherines.  Their neighbour (a peeping tom) ended up being captured on video on the mother and daughter's property doing some unpleasant things to himself.  Case got dropped due to violations of privacy because the neighbour’s yard (belonging to the perpetrator and his family) and back of the house was captured in the video.  As for interfering with hunters and anglers, doesn’t the Ontario fish and wildlife conservation act covers that?  Obstruction of hunting, trapping or fishing 13(1) A person shall not interfere with lawful hunting, trapping or fishing by,  © engaging in an activity, for the purpose of interfering, that disturbs or is likely to disturb wildlife or fish.  Wouldn’t banging pots and pans be a likely cause to disturb wildlife and interfere with hunting?  Surely after a number of complaints, the ministry or the cops would key in on the pattern.  I've seen some real nut jobs while out fishing. Can't imagine the weirdos you meet when you're out hunting cute animals like deer or rabbits.LOL"
442028,BillM,2010-03-10 01:35:00,17367,I think the best idea is just to shoot the neighbour and bury him in the backyard.
442037,AzuluSpookd,2010-03-10 01:57:00,348,"  I really like you're way of thinkin' Bill   We're all aware MJL of what constitutes interfering with fishing and hunting, but trying to prove it is another story!  They're working on it!!"

442100,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-10 06:59:00,158,"I think a restraining order or whatever it is called that makes it law to keep them away by however many feet.  Also some trailcams like everyone is suggesting, set them up with some sort of bait ie something the person can't resist destroying. catch that on camera and you will have tresspassing as well as destruction of property, hell even build a small shack with a lock on it and nail them for breaking and entering. Use this idiots boldness against them."

442123,hookerdown,2010-03-10 12:04:00,110,"Since the guy is interfering, well actually harrassing your buddy while in the act of hunting, I would charge him with harrassment.   I agree that the P3TA activist is boardering on stalking as well.  Either way, if your buddy decides to charge or just make it known what this guy is doing, I would think it would put a damper on his Mayoral wishes."
442131,Harrison,2010-03-10 13:31:00,2202,"What a pain.  We were walking into a property with bows in hand and lady pulled over and cried "" Your not going to kill those deer are you"" I responded ""no, we are going to try and harvest one"".  She freaked and said "" You have NO RIGHT to do that, they are beautiful creatures and you can't hunt here""  Caught off gaurd I said "" then you have no right to drive on this road because I said so and every right to close your eyes and pretend you didn't see us becasue I said so"" She called the police and in a round about way, won , as I got a ticket for an expired sticker on my plate and she disrupted our evening hunt.  As for your buddy Zulu, it's unfortunate, but the neighbour will always be a pain.  However, you can return the favour.  I would hold some weekly skeet shooting events.  Right close to the propery line, especially during the summer and on Sunday afternoons."
442132,cranks bait,2010-03-10 13:37:00,721,As far as I know and remember from my hunting course and just finished reading my girlfriends book as she is taking the course right now.  The red dot is NO TRESPASSING not no hunting.  As for the P3TA ( I know I didn't use a 3 but don't you think they have caught onto and look for that  by now as well?) neighbor.  Don't let your buddy stoop to his level.  Have him record everything.  Write it in a book and date it as to what the neighbor is doing.  The neighbor is harassing it sounds like and that is illegal and he can/should be charged.  With a book of everything going on will only help in the case for your buddy.  He is doing nothing wrong and should continue to hunt in peace and happiness as that is what it is all about.  Just be ethical about it and don't do it right in the neighbors face.  If your buddy cannot do anything about the neighbor taking his picture your buddy should return the favour and start taking pictures back.  Sounds like the two of them should get together for some beers (not too many though) and talk about what they are doing and their lifestyles.  Sadly this usually never ends happy though.
