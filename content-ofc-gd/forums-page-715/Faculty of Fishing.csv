442270,troutologist,2010-03-10 21:56:00,951,Has anyone seen this? Faculty of Fishing  Lots interesting info by the looks of things.
442279,tightline,2010-03-10 22:29:00,322,I got there card at the fishing show...have a look at there prices and tell me how interested you are
442284,raptorfan,2010-03-10 22:39:00,126,"I really don't think those prices are very unreasonable if the content of the course is good.  It is about the same price as a good book, but here you have people to answer your questions on the curriculum."
442285,cheaptackle,2010-03-10 22:45:00,849," But but but...they're on sale 1/3 off!     Act now and be enrolled in the points program, PLUS get a 75.00 graduation gift when you pass all 4 modules. tightline, how could you pass it up? hee hee hee  Michael"
442288,Terry,2010-03-10 22:52:00,14456,I guess if you never fished before or didn't know about OFC then it might be a good thing
442289,Roy,2010-03-10 22:53:00,13728,My faculty of fishing is right here.
442291,xeon,2010-03-10 22:55:00,350,"$100 for hours of straight information isn't bad at all. I actually really like the idea, and can definitely see this being pretty handy for people who are just starting out."
442295,Mykester,2010-03-10 23:03:00,241,"How many points do you get for referring someone? I also don't see why ANYONE would buy something from their online store, it's basically a huge advertised stamped on your body. These courses might be okay for someone who is new to fishing, but it's much easier (and cheaper) to just ask questions on this site. They would have more success if they can get this course certified by the Ministry of Education so that it can give out high school credits for completion of the program."
442296,raptorfan,2010-03-10 23:05:00,126,"I agree Roy, to a point.  It is better if you are part of the ""in"" crowd, or have been here for 4 years and made thousands of posts, and gone to the get togethers..  For people who are still relatively new though, getting info or advice can be like having a root canal sometimes, and others it is just not worth the embarassment some people give you for asking a question they think is obvious but to someone new to the game is valuable."
442302,Roy,2010-03-10 23:15:00,13728,Faculty of fishing might also want to look into any copyrights on the tune they're using on the site. Ray Carrignan has been using that tune for his shows since 2000 and the entire show is held under copyright.
442310,xeon,2010-03-10 23:29:00,350," 1 point/package. If you refer 5000 people and they each take the 4 course package, they'll buy you a new boat. Problem is you have to buy the course first yourself..."
442393,Fisherman,2010-03-11 02:09:00,7201,"Hmm, maybe another e-mail harvesting site, take the test, but they don't give you the results without signing up.."
442400,xeon,2010-03-11 02:28:00,350, Most likely not.  Kind of sounds like you're getting tons of spam everyday?
442406,Fisherman,2010-03-11 02:35:00,7201,"Got that problem of SPAM solved,  goes directly into the spam box and doesn't get downloaded anymore."
442660,Terry M,2010-03-11 21:13:00,1,"Hey Folks, Just wanted to follow-up on the discussion regarding Faculty of Fishing.  We have put a lot of effort towards trying to bring a reputable and informative program to the fishing industry.  For the beginner angler - we hope to help accelerate their knowledge base and ultimately their success and passion for the sport. For the more advanced angler – all in the eyes of the beholder, but we feel that re-enforcing of information and even the possibility of learning more is something that any angler would respect.  There are many good mediums available to help deepen the fishing knowledge and we are simply introducing a new alternative.  It will appeal to some and may not be for others.  Regarding the pricing, we do not feel that we are overpriced for what you get.  The content is presented through photos and illustrations, animation, narration and video. The introduction course is representative of how the - 13 plus hours of content is presented to the student.  This course might not be for everyone, but those that have been through it - like it and hopefully we will gain the reputation as being a solid product to help angler’s learn more.  PS – store items were created because our students liked the logo and asked for it.... and regarding website music...we hold the license to use it, the referral program does not require any purchase of our course - you can register for it with-out buying and lastly - promise no e-mail harvesting.  Thanks Every One, Terry"
442668,Mykester,2010-03-11 21:30:00,241,"Definitely not over priced, my friend spent around $400 for some course that only lasted a couple hours while he was up in Muskoka. Oh and they were promised to fish in a pike hot spot, but no one was able to catch a thing."
442682,solopaddler,2010-03-11 21:56:00,8605,I'm amazed that anyone would sign up for something like this.
442709,raptorfan,2010-03-11 23:06:00,126, Why is that solo?  I am gonna register on the weekend.
442717,bare foot wader,2010-03-11 23:17:00,1354,although I'd have to agree with the vast majority of opinion here that this course wouldn't offer much value to myself(being an expert of course and know everything..ha) but I think it's fair priced and would offer valuable info for a beginner.  would be very cool to see this type of program offered in public school level....and props to them for posting on this thread too...
