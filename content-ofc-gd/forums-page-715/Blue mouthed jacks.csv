The fact is that in the Spanish waters is something usual, maybe not usual but not rare at all, to fish northern pikes with this blue mouth coloration.    Is this also going on in the waters you fish? I have ask also in some other European forums and it seems to be pretty located in the Iberian Peninsula.  Thanks in advance for your answer."

443024,bare foot wader,2010-03-12 19:20:00,1354,nice looking lure by the way...what is it?

443080,Guest Hauki,2010-03-12 22:02:00,0," The information that I have about that matter is that the blue coloration in mouth, and fins is caused by liver and biliar problems. That blue coloration is fish is something very similar to the human jaundice. If you can find any information about that matter I will really appreciate. It would be nice to contrast my information.  I don´t know which lure was using my friend, but I am almost sure that it´s not Salmo."
