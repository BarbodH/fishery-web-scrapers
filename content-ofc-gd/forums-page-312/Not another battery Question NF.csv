Go to 2amp,will not go green.It's too bad ,picked this up at a closing of a customer which I bought this new for ,not 2 years ago. When it's off charge the meter reads 12.2 volts. Just clicks like a bad ground or bad terminal connection.Swapped with the other battery to see if it was a cable thing,fired right up. Surprised it's a nautilus 730ca,160 reserve. I'm thinking the battery was mis charged,the water levels are good. Any ideas,or just trash.Thanks guys in advance. "
783562,aplumma,2013-04-30 21:02:00,6896,Sorry but it is trash. To read 12.2 means it has a dead  cell. If you take it and put a load on it it will drop voltage like a rock. I am sure a local battery seller can load test it if you want to chance them selling you a new one.  Art

783771,Fish4Eyes,2013-05-01 17:35:00,1022,Canadian Tire will load test it for you for free. It sounds like it won't hold a charge and is pooched.

783781,aplumma,2013-05-01 18:45:00,6896,Bulging can also occur if a battery discharges and freezes it is the reason I leave my boat plugged in in the winter.   Art
