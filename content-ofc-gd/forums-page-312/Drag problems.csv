782966,Jarfish,2013-04-28 23:48:00,20,"Hey Guys  I was wondering if any of you fine folks could help me with some problems I'm having with my drag. I have 3 winch type reels that I use for down rigging, and it seems that after reeling in for awhile, the drag starts to slack off. This gets to be very annoying having to tighten the drag every time I reel in. I have a Okuma Magda Pro and a Shimano Triton 300 and I don't know what the other one is.  Any ideas on what the problem could be?  Thanks  Jake"
782968,Jarfish,2013-04-28 23:53:00,20,I should also say I've never had the reels apart at all
782975,Roy,2013-04-29 00:14:00,13728,Are you using braid with no backing?
782977,kickingfrog,2013-04-29 00:18:00,8333,I haven't had that particular problem but I'm sure someone will have an idea.  One tip that I was given a while ago to help keep my drags happy was to back off the tension when the reel wasn't in use.
782978,danc,2013-04-29 00:23:00,4677,Good advice Rob.
782992,Jarfish,2013-04-29 00:50:00,20,"I'm using Mono and I started backing off my drag last year. I've tried to find an answer online, but Google has let me down. So hopefully someone with greater knowledge then me will know the answer lol."
782993,dhickey,2013-04-29 00:54:00,1038,It may be posible that your setting your drag to lite? That will destroy any reel in no time. What line are you using?  Mono has lots of give to it. Tighten up yor drag to the point you think it would break then back off 1/4 turn.
782999,Jarfish,2013-04-29 01:15:00,20,"Awesome, I'll give that a try next time. It's Trilene XL 20# if I remember correctly. I usually have the drag up pretty good as too get the fish in as fast as possible, but I'll try the 1/4 turn next time I'm out."
783065,Fish4Eyes,2013-04-29 12:03:00,1022,You sure the line is not slipping on the spool?
783066,Floren Lukatsky,2013-04-29 12:16:00,23,it sounds like the line is slipping on the spool to me. use a piece of electrical tape when you tie the knot to the spool.
783071,Fish4Eyes,2013-04-29 12:46:00,1022,"A good way to test if the line is slipping on the spool is to let out alot of the line, and then simply pull on it. If you don't hear the drag, then you know the line is slipping."
783110,Jarfish,2013-04-29 15:45:00,20,Ok I will defiantly try taping the knot next time I spool up.
783336,buick14,2013-04-30 01:14:00,741,"If fighting fish, maybe u need to grease or clean/replace your drag , or maybe its not sealed waterproff drag and its getting wet and shuddering if it isn't your line slipping......you service the reel lately and install the stacks wrong?"
