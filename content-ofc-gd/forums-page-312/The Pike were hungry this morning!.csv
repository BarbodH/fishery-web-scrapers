783906,irishfield,2013-05-02 03:49:00,26272,I've never seen so many pike in one morning... and the odd HUGE OOS Bass... so hungry to swallow big spoons and 6/0 hooks down to the gill plates. Great day on the water... fishing in a T shirt from 10am on... and celebrating Andy's birthday on opening day. Can't beat that!  One of many double headers.. before 10 am!

784092,irishfield,2013-05-03 01:58:00,26272,Bass.. YES.. lol.. 5 lbs  Pike.. I think about 30 inches was the best.
784094,Moosebunk,2013-05-03 02:00:00,3970,Snarlin`Darlin pike.  Sounds like a blast and of course with you two yahoos in one boat it`d be just that.
