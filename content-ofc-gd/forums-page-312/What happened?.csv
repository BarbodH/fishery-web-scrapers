783711,Roy,2013-05-01 10:27:00,13728,Sorry it was marked as SOLD in the early evening yesterday. Lots of good deals in the classifieds here and they go pretty quickly.
783718,Radnine,2013-05-01 11:36:00,1538,"That was a great deal and the people I had turned onto it would have bid more than he was asking, and driven up there to pick it up today! I have forwarded the other 14'er with the 15 hp out of the classifieds. Hopefully it will suit their needs. Jim"

783888,kickingfrog,2013-05-02 01:55:00,8333, Sort of how it went with our house. It wasn't on the market 12 hours and we had a firm offer at 97% of our asking price.
