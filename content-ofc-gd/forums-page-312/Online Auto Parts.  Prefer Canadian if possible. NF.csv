783788,Harrison,2013-05-01 19:20:00,2202,cool thanks
783791,irishfield,2013-05-01 19:36:00,26272,"Parts Monkey (in London I believe) www.partsmonkey.com ... quick and easy, but you might find the local carquest is cheaper for a set of hubs once you pay shipping."
783796,Harrison,2013-05-01 19:46:00,2202,"Thanks Wayne.  Found a bunch on eBay too, free shipping... not sure on quality however. Can't beat the $ though.  http://www.ebay.ca/itm/FRONT-WHEEL-HUB-BEARING-ASSEMBLY-GMC-JIMMY-S15-T15-1999-2000-2001-2005-513124-/200920691936?pt=Motors_Car_Truck_Parts_Accessories&hash=item2ec7ce74e0&vxp=mtr"
783797,irishfield,2013-05-01 19:51:00,26272,"Front hubs... don't mess around. Carquest sells an economy and a good one with timken bearings in it (Moog). Spend the extra for the work involved in changing them. Considering Leah's Sporttrac ate the first ones at 62,000 km... and I made them redo the left front a 1000 km later.. and I just did it again at 155,000 km. Make sure they're the good ones.  .. I have to thank Bernie for holding my hand through me doing Leah's truck. You get one shot at tightening the spindle / shaft nut to the proper torque."
