783211,muskymatt,2013-04-29 22:09:00,2608,"Sunday marked the beginning of the 2013 boating season for me.  A three hour 5am drive from Ottawa to Lake O to hit the Browns was the order of the day. We trolled for about 6hrs before the 3 hr drive back to Ottawa.  One heck of a day trip but we did manage this beauty.    My good buddy JM with his first ever Brown Trout. Congrats bud, that'll be tough to top for a while.  "

Thanks for sharing  we used to flatline j-9 and j-11 rapalas and sometimes the offshore yellow boards on the shoreline side and get them as shallow as 10-15 fow !!!!!! Cheers
