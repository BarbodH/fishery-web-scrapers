What do you guys think about using a salt water spinning real for a freshwater application.  There is a sexy reel I would really like get.   love to know if there is any negatives or postives Thanks.

784050,aplumma,2013-05-02 22:32:00,6896,No issues the saltwater reels are normally built with more corrosion resistant parts and better seals. The down side is they are usually slightly more expensive. I am using a few of the okuma saltwater series in fresh for big Catfish with no issues in 5 years.   Art
