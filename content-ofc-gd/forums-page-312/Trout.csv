783393,Freshtrax,2013-04-30 02:57:00,2215,In the net?
783395,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-30 03:11:00,10439," Yes. My buddy has a commercial license. I could get a personal use permit and net myself if I wanted to. Things are different up here.  FYI, there are only 16 commercial licensed fishermen operating on the lake. The lake is 27,200 sq kms and 480 kms long by 109 kms wide. It's also the deepest lake in North America @ 2,010 feet at it's deepest."
