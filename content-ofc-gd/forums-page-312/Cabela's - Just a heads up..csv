783075,Roy,2013-04-29 13:06:00,13728,The Dundee location will be closed until further notice because of an electrical fire. I was just wondering if any of you who live not too far away from there could benefit from a fire sale or something of the sort.
783077,mr blizzard,2013-04-29 13:23:00,1589,"Thanks, I wish I was, Roy could I do some damage to my wallet there."
783139,grt1,2013-04-29 17:52:00,638,"Winnipegs new Cabelas opens on May 9th, it is in the southern end of the city and is almost double the current size store"
783146,Roy,2013-04-29 18:20:00,13728,Winnipeg is the center of Canada...what can I say...
783174,misfish,2013-04-29 20:32:00,29133,"I did my first online order with them out west. I went snails mail,and had my new boots in 6 days. Also to add,,the boots were on sale last week,and they gave me the 20 buck savings back,no questions asked. Thats service."
783193,mr blizzard,2013-04-29 21:11:00,1589,"I have also found them to provide outstanding customer service, glad u saved 20 bucks."
783347,Rattletrap2,2013-04-30 01:25:00,1652,Thanks for the heads up Roy. That particular store was hit by a tornado a couple of years back as well. I'll be heading there in August. Probably back up and running long before then. I can't see them staying closed for long.
783364,wildeye rainbow,2013-04-30 01:45:00,123,I'll be golfing near there in 3 weeks - hopefully there'll be a chance to pick up some more stuff there (to add to my collection in the garage...)
783449,Lunker777,2013-04-30 13:03:00,866,Man that location hasn't had the best of luck. First hit by a tornado a couple years ago and now burnt by fire.  maybe that's why I cant catch any fish with the gear I buy from there..... its jinxed !! lol
783599,Handlebarz,2013-04-30 23:18:00,3790,I love that store I would detour up there just to walk around and look at the fish tanks way better then any BPS.
783798,Uncle Buck,2013-05-01 19:53:00,1000,I agree with Mike  Cabelas rocks!!!!
