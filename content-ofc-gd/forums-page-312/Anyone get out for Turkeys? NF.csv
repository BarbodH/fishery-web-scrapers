782340,Rustic-Fisher,2013-04-25 23:00:00,826,Hit a field this AM for some turkey hunting with a buddy. We're both rookies when it comes to Turkeys but managed to call in a few just outside our shooting distance. 10x smarter then I ever gave them credit for LOL! Anyone else get out?
782345,kickingfrog,2013-04-25 23:12:00,8333,"No, but I saw one fly across lakeshore drive just east of the southshore centre in Barrie today at 3:30pm."
782356,Sinker,2013-04-25 23:36:00,8692,"I got out for a couple hours before work. Had a couple respond to calling, but ran out of time."
782367,irishfield,2013-04-26 00:09:00,26272,I just sit on the front porch and wait from them to walk by...
782403,Radnine,2013-04-26 02:13:00,1538," Look at her, walking inside of the pylons! What a turkey. Jim"
782406,Christopheraaron,2013-04-26 02:25:00,3525,"Nope, but if anyone gets one ill gladly take all the feathers off you, pm if you have"
782416,Freshtrax,2013-04-26 04:49:00,2215,"Gobble, gobble, not mine a good friend got this bird down south in NC last week  man I miss that place sometimes."
782421,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-26 05:56:00,8243,"I saw one flying over the tree line today while on the way to Caledonia, I knew they could fly and have seen plenty but this guy was way up there at least 30 feet. Nearly got attacked just this past Tuesday going from the 11th hole to number 12 on the golf course, one would think that after all these years we would remember they are nesting there every year. Man they can be mean. Not knowing anything about hunting Turkey have they had their litter by now? Very cool bird to see in the wild and better on the table.  I usually see the weigh station open in May here in Haldimand County, they may be out of season, otherwise I might have laid a 9 iron on her, who am I kidding, that's as close to a birdy I had all year.  Hey Irishfeild, what's all that white stuff on your lawn, hasn't anyone told you guys up there it's been spring now for a few weeks? Come on (weather) man..........the jokes over. Snow flurries Saturday and golf Tuesday in short sleeves."
782541,Rustic-Fisher,2013-04-26 21:50:00,826,"  Nice, Out again today, spooked two out of their roost on my way in, then spooked another heading to a Different location. And if that's not enough I had me walk right in from of my jeep on Hwy 27. Thinking I'll stick with rainbows in the spring LOL"
782543,misfish,2013-04-26 21:58:00,29133,"  LOL Bud.  Stay at it. You,ll get one. Alot of mateing has been done.The big toms have done their bussiness,BUT Those horny jakes are still looking for a easy hen."
782573,Out4Trout,2013-04-26 23:49:00,98,"I went out this morning for a few hours. Was fortunate to harvest a decent Tom. Keep at it fellas, the challenge makes the reward of getting one even sweeter."
782575,Rustic-Fisher,2013-04-26 23:59:00,826,"Thanks Brian, Your just saying that to keep me off your rivers !! ;-) LOL"
782576,Rustic-Fisher,2013-04-27 00:02:00,826,  WOW!  That's motivation !! Nice one !!

782579,Christopheraaron,2013-04-27 00:11:00,3525,"found a tonne of those iridescent back feathers today on the river, but I'd still like some of those tail feathers"
782589,beagle dad,2013-04-27 01:10:00,224,headed out in the am have a field alive with birds just need to get close enough to take the big guy with a bow
