I have a separate deep cycle (that's tired as well) for the trolling motor (55pd 12v) and graph up front.  Should I be looking at a marine cranking battery, a combo cranking/deep cycle or just deep cycle.  A small 24 series deep cycle is what was in there before.  For the front, Deep Cycle only.  27 or 31 series?  I am guessing the difference is how much reserve power I have."
784220,bigbuck,2013-05-03 18:40:00,2449,You are fine with another Group 24 CRANKING battery. If you were running a trolling motor then you go with a Deep Cycle. Hopefully your TM battery lasts this year for you.
