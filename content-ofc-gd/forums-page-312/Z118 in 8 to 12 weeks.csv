783217,StarTzar,2013-04-29 22:15:00,51,It's time to trade in the Stratos for a Ranger. Our 2004 Stratos 275XL Pro was our first bass boat. Served us well for the past two years. Now we're getting a Z118 Comanche Ranger. The waiting period is 8 to 12 weeks.
783222,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 22:20:00,93,"Bye Bye Stratos, you won't be missed!    Hellllloooo Ranger  (please note picture is showing the 520 model, we got the exact colour scheme in the Z118 model)  "
783233,StarTzar,2013-04-29 22:28:00,51,Nice
783235,lew,2013-04-29 22:30:00,12766,"Nice boat there boyz, congrats  !!"
783236,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 22:30:00,93,Thanks Lew!

783242,StarTzar,2013-04-29 22:37:00,51, You have a typo in your post.... batmobile should be BassMobile
783246,Chance,2013-04-29 22:44:00,420,"You will love the Ranger, I made the switch years ago and happy I did. They are not the fastest hull on the market but have an awesome ride. I fish Erie quite a bit and have no issues hitting the big waves ."
783249,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 22:47:00,93," That's what we got told, not the same hull as the Stratos, which is more speed oriented, but as you mentioned the ride on the Ranger is much more stable on choppy windy days.  I have no doubt we will enjoy the Ranger to it's fullest."
783257,StarTzar,2013-04-29 22:59:00,51,Hey Maverick..... Hopefully you'll be using the Ranger livewell more than you did the Statos's
783260,StarTzar,2013-04-29 23:01:00,51, 55 mph is good enough for us. We are looking forward to the stability the Ranger will give us in rough water.

783415,fishindevil,2013-04-30 09:52:00,6254,Awesome new rig guys !!! What are you putting on her for power???
783416,fishindevil,2013-04-30 09:53:00,6254,Getting a few talons as well or a power pole ???
783421,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-30 10:30:00,8243,"What do you mean nice? It's your post. Why don't you post a classified here for her unless the deal for a trade is done? She sure is clean looking. I know the Ranger will serve you well for a couple of Bassassins.  Was that you passing me last opener doing 50? Do you know how many smallies you ran over?  I might not be going fast but get nervous when the capt. tells me to put on a crash helmet in a boat!!!!!!!!!!!  You won't believe a fish just jumped 12' from shore as I was typing, it surely must be a sign from above. Might not be a bass but it's a fish. That 9 AM T time would be cancelled if I had a battery in the boat today."

783423,TheMaverick,2013-04-30 10:33:00,93, We previously had a Power pole on the stratos so we'll be trying out a Talon this year.
783436,StarTzar,2013-04-30 11:46:00,51,"Old Ironmaker,  The Maverick is my Son and the Stratos is going as trade in."
783442,Chance,2013-04-30 12:25:00,420,"Nah ,not me I was doin 75    Go fast,burn gas,catch bass!"
