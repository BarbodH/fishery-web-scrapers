783742,mike rousseau,2013-05-01 14:12:00,4661,For lots of people the fishing season really starts this weekend...  Considering our chilly spring... Just remember some fish may not have spawned yet... I'm pretty sure ill be catching some walleye full of eggs... So use your heads if your keeping fish... Try to release fish that look like they're full of eggs... It would be a shame taking a limit home and throwing thousands of eggs in the garbage....  Just my opinion...
783745,aplumma,2013-05-01 14:18:00,6896,Good Opinion Mike. Be safe on the water it is still really cold.   Art
783752,Roy,2013-05-01 14:47:00,13728,"Walleye doesn't open 'til May 10th here. We can never rely on opening dates as far as spawning fish are concerned so yeah....good tip, Mike. And not only for walleye."
783822,Nipfisher,2013-05-01 21:11:00,2449,3rd Saturday in May here Roy. Zone 11 SUCKS bad. No pike or bass year round when our lakes are polluted with them? Nipissing closed to all fish fromm March 15th to 3rd Sat in May?????? Lake Trout closed from 3rd Sunday in March to 3rd Sat in May in most lakes with a few exceptions???????
783832,irishfield,2013-05-01 21:41:00,26272,"Yah.. they really messed that up when Pike were originally open ALL year on Temagami...unfortunately I was correct when I said they would take the most restrictive regulation from a specific lake/zone and make it the regulation when they combined many zones into less and larger zones. I hear what Mike is saying and sure it's great food for thought, although I'm sure the MNR knows what they are doing with respect to the seasons. At least they sure told us so when we question why in the hell they were box trapping Muskie, on the 1st of May, in the Green Islands today."
783834,fishindevil,2013-05-01 22:23:00,6254,Some years on the Ottawa river we still get fish that have not spawned right up till the end of may !!!! That's why now you really cannot keep any till June 15th !!!!! It took years for the MNR to listen to us anglers and change the opening dates !!!! But yes it's hard to know the spawning dates every year depending on the winter the water levels the temps !!!! It all has an effect !!!! For example 2 yrs ago we were catching crappies on our lake April 1st  well this year the ice only went off April 16th so it varies greatly but good tip for sure mike!!!! I can't wait to have a fresh feed of good ole marble eyes !!!!!!! Another week to go here.....
