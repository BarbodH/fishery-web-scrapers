783926,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-02 11:10:00,8243,"Mat,  Take a look at Cozy Cove cottages on Callendar Bay, on the south shore of Nippissing  Nice little sandy beach. Play area with swings etc. It is on a small bay loaded with panfish that is sheltered from the big lake that can get bad scary fast. Many places to visit just a short ride to North Bay, everything to do on a rainy day. Matinees at the theatre, restaurants, Mickey D's, big grocery stores and shops. Dionne quintuplits museum at the top of the road. Across the road you can have them pick wild blueberrys all day long. I don't know if the blueberries they eat or the excersize but they will be asleep all night long. There's always the dump for Bear watching. Really good safe boats with electric starts on them. The cottages were spotless..  If you want to venture out on the bay less than a 1/2 mile a great shoal for smallies, pike and walleye.  I hereby declare that I have no affiliation in any way associated with this resort, it's management, ownership, board of directors et all .  Sorry I just couldn't help it. I can be such an A hole sometimes."
783937,mattyk,2013-05-02 12:10:00,2110,Thanks iron maker!
783968,SmokestackLightnin,2013-05-02 15:54:00,390," This is the reason I suggested Wright Point Resort.  Big sand beach that faces southwest for sunsets over the water.  Lots of kids toys on the beach also has volleyball net.  The beach has an enclosed (roped off) swimming area that has a very large floating island with a kid launcher.  The launcher is at one end and a kid sits on it, then someone from the trampoline part of the island jumps to the opposite end of the launcher and you go flying up in the air an into the water.  I am not affiliated with the resort but my cottage is close to it.  There are usually families with kids up every week in the summer so the opportunity to make friendship with other families is possible.  This place is geared toward families with kids.  The fishing for walleye, pike and bass is pretty good."
783969,SmokestackLightnin,2013-05-02 15:55:00,390,There is a virtual tour of the property on their Website and you can see the beach:  http://www.wrightpointresort.com/Virtual_Tours/Resort/index.html 
784105,Henricus,2013-05-03 02:47:00,118,"I will 2nd Pine Vista.  We stayed there a number of years in a row.  Cottages are clean, nice sand beach,  nice pool, kids programs, frog catching, canoeing, great fishing with plenty of panfish for kids and bass walleye and musky for Dad.  We even rented one of their pontoon boats and toured the lake for the day.  It's a beautiful lake.  If you are a golfer, as a guest you are able to play Wildfire which is expensive but a spectacular course...and you can get there by boat.  Full disclosure:  no affiliation, haven't been since '07."
782630,mattyk,2013-04-27 12:42:00,2110,Howdy folks. Looking for any suggestions for a cottage resort that is family friendly with a nice beach and some half decent bass/pike and panfish for the kids. Looking for somewhere about 3.5 hours from Newmarket. Thank you.
782631,Ralph Field,2013-04-27 12:56:00,1018,Silver Glen Cottages on Doe Lake at Katrine has what you are looking for.
782809,can u fish,2013-04-28 10:11:00,326,Shebe resort cottages check us out on line @ www.sheberesort.com  great bass fishing  with a lot of small pike the kids will catch panfish all day and we still have walleye in the lake also a nice sandy beach.   Cheers Mitch.....
783168,T-Bone,2013-04-29 20:20:00,160,Cozy Camp Cottages on Lake Nosbonsing sounds like it'd be perfect for your needs. Good fishing...nice place...nice people.  http://www.cozycampcottages.com/index.htm
783296,pidge,2013-04-29 23:50:00,438,"When I was a wee one Dad use to take us to Jakes Blue Roof Cotages. I havent been there in probably 4-5 years, but they had a beach, fishing, and The town of Campbellford right their. Maybe someone can confirm if the choclate factory is still there and theres also a Provincial park of some sort near by as well. We always had great service.....hmmm reminds me I should book."
783318,wildeye rainbow,2013-04-30 00:53:00,123,"If you want a camp that runs a bit of a children's program (such as scavenger hunts, kids fish derby, bingo, etc), I would try Dry Pine Camp on the French River in Alban.  They don't have a beach but have an inground pool.  It's also fairly close to Sudbury where you can visit Science North.  Some local attractions are the French River visitor centre and the French River Trading Post where you can have lunch, or buy a t-shirt, or take a picture of your kids with the Hungry Bear and/or Blueberry Hound (that was an annual thing for us with the kids who are now in their 20's)"

783324,Roy,2013-04-30 01:00:00,13728,No spam here. Matt asked for suggestions and folks are giving their opinions regardless of their affiliation to the cottage resort.
783329,Gerritt,2013-04-30 01:07:00,6129,"meaning the owners of said resort... Perhaps the admin team needs to update the rules then, removing spam from them and allowing every business to post in every thread offering their services..  I fully expect when I ask truck questions about which brand I should be looking at, I can expect Chevy, Ford and Dodge dealers offering to sell me one and direct me to their website.  Or when I ask about a BBQ, to have purveyors offer to sell me one here in public.  The rules need to be amended if that is the case and how OFC operates now Roy.  Just say'in  G"

I dont believe Matt asked about this lodge... it was a very general question  So can we have every lodge that visits here offer their service to this member? for every post a member makes looking for advice on a lodge?  Or boat dealers offering to sell boats to members that ask general questions like ""what size boat is right for me""  I hope this is not the case.   G"

783348,Gerritt,2013-04-30 01:27:00,6129,a general question Rob.. could you imagine if every outfitter replied to every post a member makes asking about resorts? or every truck dealer replied to every post about trucks? Or every boat dealer offered to sell a boat to a member here?  Guess I am alone in this...  No commercial listings in the classifieds... but the main forum is free game.. Where do you draw the line..  I give up... not my board not my worry. Run it the way they see fit.  G

783632,mattyk,2013-05-01 00:14:00,2110,Thanks for all the feedback!
783638,Whopper,2013-05-01 00:31:00,2174,Matt if your looking for outstanding panfish fishing for the youngsters Rice Lake is the place I'd steer ya. There's plenty of resorts to choose from. Whispering Pines outside of Keene is really nice and close to some outstanding fishing spots. They don't have a beach but do have a nice pool for the wife and the kids. There's a place right down the bank called Anglers Retreat that has a beach but it's not near as nice. Good luck in your search
783748,mattyk,2013-05-01 14:27:00,2110,Thanks Phill will check it out.
783767,T-Bone,2013-05-01 15:59:00,160,"Another good one that we've been to a few times is Pine Vista Resort on Stoney Lake outside of Lakefield, Ontario.  Great kids programs (give the parents a break) and 'grown-up' programs if you want to take advantage of them. Nice in-ground pool and awesome beach area.  Check it out...  http://www.pinevista.com/"

783818,Rod Caster,2013-05-01 20:56:00,5784,A little further north at Beaverland Camp in Marten River? Lots of good reviews and the owners seem like upstanding folks.  http://www.beaverland.on.ca/site/index.php?page=activities
