These photos were from last week.  Nipfisher focusing hard on the shiny fish     Part of the catch!!    I only kept about 100 fish this year.... 25 for bait, 25 already eaten and the rest will get shared with family. I've learned that I don't like frozen smelt all that much and there is no point in wasting. For all the effort I put into smelting, it's more about the experience than the numbers."
783749,musky_hunter,2013-05-01 14:29:00,328,i've seen guys with buckets last week...is there a limit for smelt?
783753,Rod Caster,2013-05-01 14:48:00,5784,No possession limit... But after cleaning a couple hundred you may have a personal limit hahah
783757,musky_hunter,2013-05-01 15:06:00,328,people just fry them without cleaning!

783814,SirCranksalot,2013-05-01 20:48:00,3291,No need to eat the guts.. Just peel the flesh away from the spine and belly.
783817,Rod Caster,2013-05-01 20:50:00,5784,"Last year, I froze them whole and just cleaned them as I used them. I learned not to wait till they are completely thawed.... gross hahaha."
