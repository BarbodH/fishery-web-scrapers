Don't forget Pappa Gretzky had the boys on the ice at 18 months. By the time the little guy isn't so little he might be buying you a new boat with his winnings.  He has actually changed a lot since you 2 were power drinking together this past winter. I forwarded that pic from here to Japan and Europe to old friends and family and these are going as well. He's not 9 months and already an international sportsman. Insert smiley face here."
783428,NAW,2013-04-30 11:07:00,4022,"Old iron maker,  reading your post this morning made me smile ear to ear!!!   It made my morning..  Thanks man!!"
783465,quickme,2013-04-30 14:29:00,261,awesome pics!!!
783483,aero_ball,2013-04-30 15:45:00,19,"Awesome post and great pics! I Surely warms my heart! Can't wait for my turn to bring my son out (he just turned 2) to fish for the first time this summer.  Enjoy the trips to come and take lots of pics! My wife's comment: ""such a cutie!"" Keep it coming bud! : )"
782735,NAW,2013-04-28 00:08:00,4022,So my son is only 8 months old. But he loves getting packed in the snugly and going for walks in the woods. I know a few local places with a good solid shoreline. Gunna head out in the afternoon weather dependant. Cast a few spinners. See what happens.! Have any of you guys done this before? Any last minute pointers / comments?
782736,Gerritt,2013-04-28 00:12:00,6129,"bring bubbas, and a cozy blanket to lay him on when he falls asleep...  and he will!  Ohhh diapers for him and wipes for him and perhaps you as well.... when you gotta go you gotta go!  have a good time man, my opener starts tomorrow with my son as well.  G"
782749,NAW,2013-04-28 00:39:00,4022,Thanks Gerrett!  I have my camp pack converted into a diaper bag.  Good call on the cozy blanket.
782804,mike rousseau,2013-04-28 06:21:00,4661,Something for the sun....  It's one thing if your face gets a bit pink... But I imagine a sunburn on a baby would be a terrible experience...
782830,NAW,2013-04-28 12:08:00,4022,Sunscreen - check!   We picked some up last week.
782885,mr blizzard,2013-04-28 15:20:00,1589,"Take a camera, memories are priceless"
782989,NAW,2013-04-29 00:45:00,4022,"I made it out with my son for a few hours today.  He was a champ.  Just the best little guy I could possibly ask for.  He didn't make a peep the entire time out.  I had a nice report written up...  But I accidentally closed the webpage, and lost it all. (flipping back and forth between PB)..  I don't have time to write it up again  SO..  Here's a pile of pictures.  I hope you enjoy.  I sure did!!  This was his first time going fishing with Dad!  The fish count sucked...  Lost 3 at the shore.  Landed Zero.        Looks YUMMY!!!   Oh Ya..  That's GOOD!!!!   Mouth Watering!   Back for seconds..     He was interest in my reel.     Nap Time..     Some promo shots for Roy!      He's a cute kid! "

783005,Handlebarz,2013-04-29 01:31:00,3790,That's what it's all about. Just like our kids brainwash them into the fishing world.
783009,NAW,2013-04-29 01:35:00,4022,"He has a striking resemblance to his mother. Thank God!!!  I am pushing it as on option, there's no doubt about that!!  Fresh air is good for them!"
783021,porkpie,2013-04-29 01:57:00,2521,He is a cute kid!  Congrats!
783028,The Urban Fisherman,2013-04-29 02:11:00,2050,BEST report I've seen in a while! I have some of those exact same pictures - it won't be long before he's driving the boat... Averie's only 6 but it feels like yesterday that I was carying her around like that strapped to my chest.... keep up with taking pics because time flies!  Thanks for the post!
783041,Joey,2013-04-29 02:38:00,9122,Awww what a little cutie.  Love the camo outfit
