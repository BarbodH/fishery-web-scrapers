Tried a couple of different spots with limited success then happened to see an osprey dive about 100 yards from me and come up with a fish. Within 15 minutes I had watched a total of three osprey hit the same area. It was a little hard to tell if it was crappie for sure but they did have that silver look to them.  I moved over to that spot, water was 59Â° and first cast and it was crappie on. I fished for about 2 hours and landed easily 100 of them, mostly small to medium but a few really nice slabs thrown in just to keep things exciting.  I had to pack it in at 9:30 because I had promissed to help a friend with some stuff but all in all a stellar morning of fishing! "
