783376,danc,2013-04-30 02:11:00,4677,Sure. Straight off the spool and twisting as your bail rotates. Think about it. Simple physics. Try the garden hose experiment that I suggested and let me know how that works out for you.

783378,danc,2013-04-30 02:15:00,4677,"Sorry to go to this extreme Sinker, but someone wanted to know how to correctly respool a spinning reel without line twist. I'm just letting him know how to do it correctly."
783381,mercman,2013-04-30 02:30:00,7054,"I have a berkley spooling station and it has 2 positions for spoolng. one for baitcaster, where the line comes off the side of the spool, and one for spinning reels, where the line comes of the face of the spool, DanC explained it beautifully, and that the way i have been doing it for years, with zero problems."
783388,solopaddler,2013-04-30 02:41:00,8605,  Thanks for explaining I guess I've been doing it all wrong for 45 years.
783389,mercman,2013-04-30 02:44:00,7054,"happens to the best of us sometimes   I been doing IT wrong for years, but recently learned to do IT right"
783390,Nipfisher,2013-04-30 02:46:00,2449,"Just saw your post Mercman, you beat me to it. Maybe I'm doing IT wrong too   What about using the Berkley line spooling station. With Spinning reels the spool faces towards you in line with the reel. When spooling a casting reel the reel faces the side and you pull from underneath with tension on the spool.  http://www.berkley-fishing.com/products/tools-and-equipment/classics/spooling-station-portable  I bought one many years ago at a garage sale and never had a problem since."
783409,solopaddler,2013-04-30 09:31:00,8605,"I find this to be totally nitpicky topic, and really who cares??  But still it's an interesting conversation.  If one takes the spinning reel out of the equation and simply looks at line coming off the filler spool, if one was to pull it straight off the spool with a pencil through the middle is that line not perfectly straight with no twists? (yes of course it is!)  Spinning reel out of the equation again, simply pulling the line off a filler spool laying flat the line is also twist free (although you may have more memory involved pulling it off that way).  Mono is round, it's not flat. No one can deny that pulling the line off a filler spool in either manner it comes off straight and true with no twist. That is undeniable.    Now what happens after that point when it's pulled off the spool straight and twist free and spool it onto your spinning reel is out of your hands.  I can only assume that line manufacturers have always insisted on laying the spool flat with the line spooled on your reel in the same direction it's going on your reel because if you turn the spool the wrong way and reel it on that's the only scenario where you are going to get twist!!  That's the way most people spool their line so it behooves them to explain how to do it properly when laying flat."
783481,bare foot wader,2013-04-30 15:34:00,1354,"I spool up by laying the spool flat on the ground and making sure the line is coming off correctly, or by using the pencil method...both methods work equally well for me  most mid/high end reels have roller bearings in the line roller, keeping that clean and lightly lubed at the start of each season will help with the line twist situation  http://www.shimano.com/publish/content/global_fish/en/us/index/customer_service0/reel_maintenance_instructions.download.-mainParsys-000105-downloadFile.html/QFI%20Bail%20and%20Line%20Roller.pdf  steve in lambeth has a good setup for spooling, if anybody is familar, other shops have them too...zero line twist"
783671,Lukasaurus,2013-05-01 02:24:00,19,"When you lay the spool flat on the floor, how do you keep tension on the line?  I use the pencil method. I hold the spool between my feet and create tension by pressing the spool again the carpet. Never had a problem in 40 years."
783676,danc,2013-05-01 02:38:00,4677,"Just for fun, and also to ensure my own sanity, I did a little experiment at work today. I strung out about 20 feet of half inch rope, making sure that there were zero twists in it. I tied one end to a 6 inch round shaft, told my partner to hold the other end and not let it roll in his hand (as would be the case with the pencil method) as I proceeded to simulate a spinning reel bail and wrap it around the shaft with a gloved hand. With about 5 feet of rope left to go of the 20 feet, it was twisted up like a pretzel. What I learned from all of this is today that my sanity is just fine. And that was a big relief to me."
783680,danc,2013-05-01 02:47:00,4677,"I just use my thumb and finger about a foot above the reel for tension. The line just falls off of the spool, but because there is almost zero twisting, except for the fact that the line and reel spools are most likely different diameters, there's no problems with the line free falling off of the line spool."
783688,solopaddler,2013-05-01 03:00:00,8605," Not comparable at all, try it on a spinning reel."
783696,danc,2013-05-01 03:33:00,4677,"Wow. I thought that this would have sealed the deal for sure. But apparently not. I have tried it on a spinning reel once or twice. Maybe even 3 times. The only thing that I could have done differently to duplicate the scenario exactly would have been to wind the 20 feet of rope onto some kind of spool and have a rod of some sort through the spool. But the results would have been the same. By either holding the rope and not let it counter effect the need for twisting or putting a pencil through the spool, there is no way to counter effect the fact that the bail is twisting the line with each revolution. You'd have to flip your pencil held spool once for each turn of your bail to counter act any twisting. Or use the easier way of laying the spool on the floor and have it come off of the spool the same way that your bail is turning. That's not an opinion. That's a fact.  Anyways, I'm done with this thread. The OP wanted to know how to respool without line twist. I told him. He can use your method, which involves less line twist than spooling completely backwards, or he can use mine which involves the closest thing to zero line twist that any normal person could hope to achieve. That's up to him."
783699,Sinker,2013-05-01 03:50:00,8692,Dan has explained this quite clearly. I'm not sure what there is to not understand.  The best way to avoid line twist is to use a quality inline swivel on your line.  Spool it whatever way you want!!  S.

783703,sauce,2013-05-01 05:24:00,219,I know what works for me. Some might think its the best way. Others might feel the need to try and convince me otherwise. It can be done wrong. So its a matter of how wrong is acceptable to you. Just sayin...
783708,solopaddler,2013-05-01 09:34:00,8605, The reason I find this thread so interesting is because of Dan's insistence that there's only one way to put line on a spinning reel correctly. There are two correct ways at least imo.

782672,206,2013-04-27 20:05:00,563,"Apparently different manufactures spool their line in different directions, spooled 2 reels the first was fine the second is backwards, after inspection the line on second brand was spooled in opposite direction.  My question is what can i do now to get the line on the right way...I'd rather not waste the line  Any suggestions?"
782674,Raf,2013-04-27 20:23:00,3495,"are you concerned it is twisted?  if so, let it all out with nothing attached to it and troll it for 5-10 mins.  retrieve it under tension and it will be twist free.  otherwise, i'm not sure i understand why you are concerned."
782680,Garnet,2013-04-27 20:47:00,2056,"Not in a boat ? Tie to fence walk it off cut, walk back to fence and reel it back on reel."
782687,SlowPoke,2013-04-27 21:02:00,2984,Am I missing something here? Why didn't you just flip the spool so it comes off in the right direction?
782693,kickingfrog,2013-04-27 21:22:00,8333,My brother used to have an ultra-lite abu spinning reel that was like that. Only spooled up once at a tackle store the wrong way.
782694,kickingfrog,2013-04-27 21:33:00,8333,"Uh reread it.   It's not the reel spool but the line manufactor's spool that is the problem. As above, let it out in the boat or in the park and reel it in. The boat, if an option, is much easier I find. Mark the line spool for next time if there is still line on it and just flip it over like Slowpoke said."
782698,lew,2013-04-27 21:55:00,12766,"When your putting new line on a spinning reel, just crank on a few layers, then drop your rod tip down till the line goes limp. If it twists up like crazy it means it's going on backwards, so simply flip it over.  If it just basically lays limp when you put the tip down, your doing it correctly."
782706,misfish,2013-04-27 22:48:00,29133," BINGO  I also like to put the spool in a bucket of water,before spooling. Cuts down on friction."
782715,206,2013-04-27 23:04:00,563,"Thanks guys  I will try the boat trick tomorrow, I feel stupid, but like i said...had both spools label facing me never even thought to check which way the manufacturer spooled it I guess i'm batting 500 which is better then the Jays"
782733,Rod Caster,2013-04-27 23:36:00,5784,"Don't feel stupid, I can't count how many spools of mono/fluoro I've wasted due to horrible twisting. I still have a hard time re-spooling with mono.... another reason I love braid."
782739,Leecher,2013-04-28 00:18:00,7832,"Not sure what type of line your using but for mono, I use a pencil that I place thru the middle of line spool, ask someone to hold it with both hands with a piece of paper towel to avoid burning their finger tips and make sure that the line comes off the spool from the bottom.  If by yourself, use the pencil as above and place between your knees and again... make sure the line comes off the bottom.  Works everytime for me   Never had any problems what so ever"
782798,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-28 04:46:00,8243,"No stupid questions here. I spool lines on backwards all the time, used to be called stupid by my parents and all the teachers, now I'm called dyslectic."
782806,Garnet,2013-04-28 09:00:00,2056,Stand spool up. start spooling. With in 3-4 turns you will see how the spool wants to fall. That's the right way.
782905,Beans,2013-04-28 18:31:00,3339,I get rid of line twist by walking off the entire spool und rewind it back on under tension of a finger and thumb with nothing on the end of the line...
782961,danc,2013-04-28 23:32:00,4677,"Lay the spool on the floor and start cranking. Any decent quality line will have a notch in the spool that will flip it over to the correct side. In fact I've never come across any line that doesn't have this built in auto correct feature in decades. If you somehow spooled up incorrectly, do what Raf said. And never, ever do what TroutJunkie suggested."
782995,Leecher,2013-04-29 01:05:00,7832, Why???
783018,danc,2013-04-29 01:50:00,4677,"Assuming that we are talking about a spinning reel here, you are adding twist to the line with your method. It has to come off of the line spool in the same direction that it is going onto the reel. Simply lay your spool of line on the ground and look down at your rod as if it were a shotgun. Your reel should be turning counter clockwise. If the line is coming off of the spool counter clockwise, and it should be with the notched spool, you are adding minimal twist to your line. Because the reel and line spools are different diameters, you will still be adding minimal twisting. To reduce this, do as Lew said and lower your rod tip to the spool and see if it twists. If it does (and it will) simply flip the spool over for a few cranks until there is no more twisting. On the other hand , your method is perfect for filling a bait caster."
783232,Leecher,2013-04-29 22:27:00,7832, That's good to know Dan!  Thanks   Just in case I'm haven't explained myself properly about making sure to feed the new spool line from bottom... made a little sketch of what I was trying to say   with the help of someone or by yourself... works great everytime  
783278,Rod Caster,2013-04-29 23:21:00,5784,Good stuff Dan. That was very well explained.
783298,solopaddler,2013-04-29 23:52:00,8605,"Never in my life have I spooled up any of my spinning reels by laying them flat. I put a pencil through the spool and reel it on that way, same as a baitcaster. If anyone can explain to me logically how that method will twist your line I'm all ears. I'd love to hear what I've been doing wrong for over 40 years LOL!"
783303,kickingfrog,2013-04-30 00:00:00,8333,The very design of a spinning reel imparts a twist to the line. The key is to try to keep it to a minimum and going in the same direction.
783304,solopaddler,2013-04-30 00:07:00,8605," I can definitely see how your line would be twisted if you lay the spool flat and reel it on in the wrong direction, that's obvious. But spooling it on with a pencil through the spool, it's coming straight off the spool, there is no twist. I've spooled thousands of spinning reels that way over the last few decades with zero issues."
783325,danc,2013-04-30 01:01:00,4677,"It's simple physics Mike. When reeling in from a pencil, every turn of your bail adds some twist. That's not hard to figure out. The old story was to reel in with the line spool label up, but line manufacturers have since added the fail proof notch on the spool that flips it to the correct side. Why would they do this if it doesn't matter? Why don't they just say to use the pencil method? That would be so much easier if it didn't matter. It may be a small detail, but with your attention to detail about so many other things, I'm surprised that you can't understand this. Try your method with a 100 foot garden hose on a 12 inch hose reel and see if you can keep the far end of the hose from turning (twisting) as it comes in. Clearly something has to give. Is this logical enough? LOL!"
783371,solopaddler,2013-04-30 01:53:00,8605," It's not simple physics Dan, there is no twist when you spool it on that way. It's coming straight off the spool, think about it.  Anyhow In all my years I've never had any line twist and that's good enough for me.  As for why the line manufacturers suggest spooling it on in the way you describe I have no idea. It's always been one of lifes greatest mysteries to me, not unlike the Caramilk secret LOL!  I'd suggest to anyone who doesn't agree to try it first before you denounce it."
783373,Sinker,2013-04-30 02:02:00,8692,"I didn't realize it was such a task to fill a reel with line. I've done it both ways with no issues, but usually lay the spool flat on the floor and wind it on.  S."
