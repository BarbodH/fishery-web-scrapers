779878,Headhunter,2013-04-15 16:22:00,5703,"So, I think I have this right though I am sure that someone here will correct me if I am wrong!LOL So, ultimately we will either have the status quote, where the Ontario Government continues to run the park or we will have First Nations running the park. Myself, as much as I have little to no respect for our elected officials, atleast we can vote them out of office... same can't be said for First Nations. The devil you know, vs the devil you don't. HH"
779880,fishnsled,2013-04-15 16:49:00,3520," Just another government I don't trust.  The finacial mismanagement of Attawapiskat is a recent example of this with “An average of 81 per cent of files did not have adequate supporting documents and over 60 per cent had no documentation of the reason for payment,” in the recent audit.  Perhaps they would do a better job of governing these lands then the present government.   I have no confidence that this will happen. Just words out of another politcians mouth to get a ""vote"" imo.   We all need to stand for something and as a community shouldn't we be taking a stand for what we love to do (fish and hunt),  to protect what we have."
779881,fishnsled,2013-04-15 16:52:00,3520," I don't think we know either devil that well but you are correct, at least we can vote them out in the next election."
779884,Rod Caster,2013-04-15 16:57:00,5784,I'm fine with the Algonquins operating the park...just not under the current ambivalent and detail-void proposed terms! I'd also be fine with status quo as long as the Algonquins get a settlement they deserve/was promised.
779895,Headhunter,2013-04-15 17:39:00,5703,"Yah, I can see it now... welcome to Algonquin Park, unfortunately several of our other demands are not being met by various levels of governement, so, the park is closed until we get what we want... and everyone knows how quickly the feds work with regard to first nations! LOL HH"
779898,jedimaster,2013-04-15 17:48:00,3472,"Guess what happens to the small towns that rely heavily on traffic generated from travelers that go through the east gate if there was a blockade? Towns like Apsley, Bancroft, Whitney would all stand to lose a lot.  Having the FN's control the land at the gate is big trouble IMO. To be honest, extending there land treaties I am totally fine with, but messing with the Park that almost every single one of us grew up going to is real bad news."
779900,Headhunter,2013-04-15 17:56:00,5703,"We keep hearing and reading about First Nations rights.. they have the right to_________, well you fill in the blank. Why would anyone believe that the Algonquins would be any different then any other First Nations group, when it comes to ""enjoying their rights""?  Whether those rights include netting the lakes, mining or forrestry, why or why would they be any different? I have to agree with some of the above posters... history has shown us the First Nations people are no better than anyone else at managing resources... including the resources they receive by way of government payments. Don't agree, take a drive by ANY first nations reserve... bring a garbage bag! HH"
779902,fishindevil,2013-04-15 17:59:00,6254,well once they net all the lakes who will re-stock them ???

Segregated people with no proper infrastructure tend to be a bit lax about cleaning. Furthermore look at any poverty stricken area, including parts of the towns we all live in. To blame the First Nations for our problems seems pretty petty. Everyone knows the history.  I myself am 9th gen Canadian (via U.K.) and carry 1/64 Mohawk blood. I am very proud of that, give me three acres please lol"
779913,Headhunter,2013-04-15 19:06:00,5703,"It's human nature to not hold dear, that which is un-earned. One could argue that mis-mangement has extrapolated a problem, but then labels would be given to those who speak... On a side note, I wonder how the M.E.C. type folks are going to react when knowledge of this becomes more wide spread? I bet they won't like the Algonquin Casino and Resort very much... HH"

You'll find a private access road for First Nations driving in to hunt on the East Side or to fish Radiant Lake.  They're ALREADY messing with the Park. They've hunt the Eastern half of the Park for more than 10 years, quietly mind you. Dan O. Dan O."

They are certainly not in it for us but in it for themselves and the great pay increases.    The worst part is they don't fear the people that put them in power until the next election.  At that point they hope we have forgotten how they screwed us over, make some promises that if we are elected we will .   It is time for a wake up call.  I'm all for occupying MEC..."

Hey, Phil, next time you send that PC promo literature out (junk mail), I'll be sure to pass it on too. Not what I pay you for my friend. I recieved this from the Minister of Abroginal Affairs. Canned, spammed and devoid of  any form of material content: . Premier Kathleen Wynne shared with me your message to her regarding the preliminary draft Agreement-in-Principle (AIP) for the Algonquin land claim negotiations.  I am pleased to respond.  Our government appreciates learning about your concerns.  We recognize that hunting and fishing are important activities for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.  Ontario will be seeking workable solutions that respect the interests of all society, provide continued public access to Crown lands and natural resources, and protect biodiversity, resource sustainability and conservation.  The preliminary draft AIP is not a final product.  Ontario will continue to consult with the public and stakeholders to ensure that their interests are understood and considered fully as part of these negotiations.  There are still several years of work ahead before a Final Settlement Agreement can be reached. The provincial negotiation team will continue to consult extensively with:  You also asked about the 2007 Algonquin Land Claim Declaration Order.  The order is a process through which all affected Ontario government ministries will screen and evaluate potential environmental effects and carry out public, agency and Aboriginal consultation.  The public consultation related to the 2007 Algonquin Land Claim Declaration Order will take place after a draft Agreement-in-Principle has been ratified and approved by all three parties.  I encourage you to review the full content of the preliminary draft AIP, the other resource materials, and to keep up to date on the latest developments in the Algonquins of Ontario negotiations through the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs’ web site.

There is still quite a bit of time before things get finalized, but at this point in time, it seems, our Governments aren't doing a great job at negotiating on non-aboriginals behalf.  As the speaker (Mr.Winters) said, I think the best thing to do is to raise awareness with friends, family, groups and governments. The land claim area is important to A LOT of people and we should all get something out of the negotiation.  "
779387,edmichit,2013-04-13 01:08:00,145,"interesting that the claim areas, just happen to be the entry points to the park...hmm"
779401,Twocoda,2013-04-13 02:53:00,4130,The Algonquin are aware of the gold and will not let the park turn into a mine for corporate Canada.... John states there needs to be a modern day treaty.... I think that is a reference to one that the Government will actually honour... Pfffft... Like that is even possible with the conditions and situations such they are creating today
779525,Rod Caster,2013-04-13 21:31:00,5784,"ya, I don't trust the gov anymore than I trust the algonquins to be honest...everyone has their own agenda, including me, really. Hopefully the fact that there are Municipal, Provincial and Federal govs that a well-written, well-negociated ""modern day treaty"" will actually be something that we can all respect and honor."
779543,mr blizzard,2013-04-13 23:14:00,1589,Its interesting that some people who want land claims and have been seen on tv  protesting are the same ones who do not work but can run up a 500 hundred dollar liquid refreshment tab on a Friday night and run them at midnight to a dry settlement and triple their profits but I am sure that only applies to the arctic
779563,Rod Caster,2013-04-14 00:13:00,5784,I'm so glad that wasn't Mr.Winters opening line. Did you listen to the presentation? Voice your concerns/ideas about the proposed AP land claim settlement to your government(s) if you have any...

Your government(s) is/are in theory here to represent you and that's what we should be forcing them to do in this instance.  I've spoken with a few FN members in the Shawanaga area....they are part of the Williams treaty, which will be updated/re-assessed soon as well. This one covers a much larger section of Southern Ontario including the Kawarthas and they surely will use the AP land claim as precedence."

My initial thought on all this was it'll take years... but at the rate our present day Government is slaughtering the environment I don't think so anymore.  Like you, (and after listening to that video last night) I am quite worried for where Canada's head is at right now, and where our dictators are leading us.  In the long run... Harper is doing an excellent job now of ensuring big business can do as they please.  And in future with the Native land owners, it'll be much cheaper for businesses to pay out 10,000 folks here or there in order to obtain whatever's needed on their lands.  Thanks for posting the video, it was educational... and disturbing."
779645,fishnsled,2013-04-14 14:57:00,3520," Now is certainly the time to speak up!  It is very disturbing how fast this seems to be moving along.  What other hidden agendas lie underneath of all of this.  I've never trusted any politician but Harper more than any other.  Can you imagine Algonquin Park as a mining quarry instead??  The thought of all this land being handed over with little to no stipulations in place is just not right.  The ""we'll sort that out later"" mentality is unacceptable!!  We need an agreement that we can all live with and ALL can use for many generations to come."
779648,Rod Caster,2013-04-14 15:15:00,5784,"My sentiments exactly, Will.  The idea that right now there are no ""written"" restrictions for building cabins, roads, driving around the park, mining etc etc is very disturbing and AMATEUR!"
779682,Gerritt,2013-04-14 18:08:00,6129,"It was a great presentation, with as it seems some dire consequences... why sign an agreement and make amendments afterwards? We the Canadian people are the only ones to lose here...  We need to get the word out, We need to stand united,  This is a VERY sad state of affairs if this happens... and it will.....  Dont get me wrong... I believe our native people deserve better... but to what limit? and to exclude the rest of us as a nation? taking over parks that generations have enjoyed... I think 117,500 acres is absurd... and that is the minimum the will accept.  add to that that is only the one sect of the algonquins.. there are overlying claims... It will become ALOT larger, and this treaty will set precedence for future treaties  A modern treaty can only work if it benefits all peoples... both native and non... otherwise it equals even more segregation and will further strain ties between native and non-natives.  These people claim to be stewards of the land, Have you ever been on a reserve? if you haven't I urge you to go for a drive through one..  Look at the maps... Algonquin park will become no more.. (PS they WILL hold the mineral rights, in addition to the land gained and money given) 550,000,000.00 as a start, for what? the color of their skin?  What will you say when Algonquin Park becomes an open pit mine ran by our indigenous? What will you say when there are no more Moose or Deer left in Ontario, When the lakes have been netted out.. What will you tell your children and their children about how Ontario ""Used"" to be..  And us? well... we lose our heritage as well....  Sickens me.  Please keep this civil...  Write your elected politicians.. Let them know your voice matters. But it might be too little too late as it looks like it is a done deal... now it is just the details...  Why is it we cannot stand together... but the voice of a few can? I hate to think we are cowards...  G"
779687,Rod Caster,2013-04-14 18:31:00,5784,"Algonquin park already gets netted and hunted, the difference now, is that there in Provincial involvement and an actual management plan. Regardless, Algonquin Park really isn't the wilderness some of us think it is. Without a management plan moving forward, things look even more bleak for the park.  I think a lot of the issues (pollution etc) on reserves are due to the treatment of the First Nations in our Canadian history. Their extremely poor treatment is NOT that far behind us.... I think, that once they settle some long-overdue issues, start putting things like residential schools, third-world treatment behind them  that they will actually become the stewards of the land, which they claim they are now... I think that they will keep connected to their original culture much more than the average Canadian ever would.  The MNR, the MOE, Env Canada and other agencies, should all work very closely with the First Nations to help them develop well-accepted methods of environmental management...let's take some time to do it right since we have a HUGE opportunity in front of us right now.  I'm not a pro on everything FN, so I really hope I'm not making hugely incorrect statements and if I am, it's out of sincere concern and consideration."

779748,Twocoda,2013-04-15 01:01:00,4130,Gerrit the Algonquins arent staking claim to the park to rape it of its resource...they are staking claim to protect it from Harpers agenda to rape it...Mr Winters does a fairly decent job of walking a non bias line...but the bottom line is....its ALL of ours and there for everyone to share regardless of skin colour...not for corporate Canada to accommodate the 1 percents bank accounts

Few if any, including most here on this site will do much more than complain or sign a meaningless online petition.you can bet if the govt was proposing to take land away from the FN's that they would be organized into protests and riots. This will go through with little organized opposition. Its unfortunate. How many non natives here would actually join in on a march, a rally, a sit in, or a protest?"

I agree with what your saying though... even though most of us probably wouldn't agree with the proposal, few of us would actually act on it. I think a couple dozen, a couple hundred, a thousand letters to MP's would make some noise though...hence the reason why I posted this."
