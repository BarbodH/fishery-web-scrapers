Cheaper and it only took me a split second to see this and said thanks, but no thanks. Yes they are curved, but there is only about a 1/4 inch of cutting blade, and yes, the price was the same as the FB 3. $119. This was the 6"". I did buy more fly tie stuff, as it 20% off.  BPS had no stock of quality hand augers. Just their straight blade brand. Both stores were light with patrons.  With that said, I will be ice fishing Christmas day, somewhere.  Sorry pizan for not getting to you. Im a dumb ass. "
