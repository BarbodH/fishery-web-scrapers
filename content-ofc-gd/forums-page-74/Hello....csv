But now I'm back in. Have been reading for the last to couple hours to catch up but only got as far as October. Glad to be back... "

Sell the place on Belmont?  I have fished it a tonne since that first time with ya, but never did as well as the one night at dusk with the smallies hitting those top waters!  Non stop action and nice ones too.  I still tell (true) stories about that night.  Take care bud.  I heard the fishing is good on the River there. Go get 'em."

Yes sold the cottage on Belmont this August and have my boat on the Ottawa but didn't get much fishing in cause it was later in the season, was working at the Cabela's up here till end of September but finally officially retired. Ya that time we fished Belmont was 2008, wow doesn't seem like 10 yrs ago... "
