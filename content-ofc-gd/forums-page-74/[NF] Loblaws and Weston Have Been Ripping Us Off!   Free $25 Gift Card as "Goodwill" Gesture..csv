1019987,Garnet,2017-12-20 10:36:00,2056,I would give $25 for a billion! Give me my thousand's back. Just another sum bag billionaire.
1019989,buick14,2017-12-20 11:51:00,741,"https://loblawcard.ca/  I used 5 different email accounts on that thing , and it says they are all invalid ...loblaws psshhhj!"
1019991,grimsbylander,2017-12-20 12:38:00,3016,"You were so excited at the thought of getting $25, you flew past the first page!! lol ""Registration for the Loblaw Card Program will open on January 8, 2018. Please check back then."" Hey, this reminds me I have a $25 BPS gift card I need to use!"
1019992,Garnet,2017-12-20 12:38:00,2056,Jan 8 is approximant day your email will work. They are just gaging if this enough damage control for stealing. 
1019999,chris.brock,2017-12-20 14:15:00,4053," Come January 8th, how are they going to control the same person from registering multiple times with different email accounts? Loblaws participated in the price fixing for 14 years, then recently ratted out the other companies involved to avoid criminal charges, hahaha, what a bunch of snakes. "
1020042,lookinforwalleye,2017-12-20 21:06:00,4399,outside of the money they get off Scott free....small retailers and consumer groups should band together and launch class action law suits.....I hate billionaires!!!
1020045,manitoubass2,2017-12-20 21:16:00,11391,"I agree  I heard on the radio the ""estimated"" amount was between $75-125 million. And they know damn well they planned it out, that's criminal in my eyes No fines or charges either since they admitted guilt, seriously????"
1020049,lookinforwalleye,2017-12-20 21:46:00,4399,What they should do is take the board of directors from all those corporations that were involved and send them on little vacation to the crow bar hotel!!!
1020057,Meely,2017-12-20 22:49:00,282,"Im sure when everyone gets their instructions on Jan 8 there will be some sort of disclaimer stating you forgive any wrong doings on their part and that you wont take part in any future class actions that may be filed. Pretty cheap way (for them) to cover their ""assets"". Meely"
1020059,manitoubass2,2017-12-20 23:16:00,11391,"I don't have a Loblaws near me, and I'm not bummed about that.  Also, this is a great reason for people to learn to make their own bread. It's alot cheaper that for sure! And it's easy"
1020062,glen,2017-12-20 23:47:00,2641,So if you say your sorry you never do jail time?
1020064,GBW,2017-12-21 00:02:00,8460,"Just so you also know, Loblaws is changing the name of it's Artisan Bread to ""The Art of Sin"" for what they have done..."
1020066,ketchenany,2017-12-21 00:17:00,3229,They may be under a different name!!!!  I had the best homemade bread last Sunday. (Calabrese) The man is a millionaire and makes his own bread.  Sooo good . Hopefully he teaches our new grandson how it’s done.   
1020070,misfish,2017-12-21 01:05:00,29133,"That home made bread, with your home made salami , with some fromage and olives and dried tomatoes.  MOTO BENI.  Barrie SUCKS, to find good eats like that."
1020084,manitoubass2,2017-12-21 04:40:00,11391," Nah, our grocery store is locally owned and been here for 115 years.  But yeah in cities and such I'm sure they own many other names!!!"
1020092,dave524,2017-12-21 12:39:00,4508,"Seriously, everyone wants to jump on Loblaws for price fixing on bread, but forget about all the government sanctioned price fixers/ marketing boards for eggs , milk , wheat, fuel etc, sorry but I really don't see a difference."
1020093,manitoubass2,2017-12-21 12:55:00,11391,"There isn't Dave, but maybe this will open some eyes and draw attention to the issue. And that's a good thing IMO I'm sure all the major retailers are in on it too.  Ahem, gas prices anyone?"
