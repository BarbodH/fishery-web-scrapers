1020304,bigugli,2017-12-25 17:34:00,6138,"With our growing family I had to bake 2 batches of pulla.  One batch done as sweet rolls. The grandkids like it Frenchie style, smothered in icing (yeecchh). Must get it from their 1/2 French mother. The second batch done as loaves on Christmas eve which we will have for breakfast tomorrow slathered in butter. One thing I'm not used to any more is getting up at 5 am with the grandkids bouncing off the walls."
