1019359,Chuck Enwinde,2017-12-12 11:58:00,247,For what it's worth I agree completely.  I think it's a bit ironic to complain about NF threads 3 pages deep in one of the most NF related topics I've seen here.   I skipped over the thread for about a week then I guess I got bored cause here I am.  Glad I got to read Lew's story

Him and I were pretty close for a few years until I found out that he was a compulsive liar. I just couldn't believe his overlapping stories anymore. He actually started to believe some of the things he made up about himself...  We reconnected about 6 months before he was to be married and I ended up as his best man. 9 months after he was married his wife committed suicide by running a hose into her car from the exhaust. We believe that she found out about a girl he had on the side who also had his child... Fast forward a couple of years and once again him and I were estranged and he had yet another girlfriend and a young son.. This is the girl who goes missing.. He says that she ran off with a new guy but it turns out that he killed her,  cut her into pieces and buried her in a couple of different places.... I believe he's up for parole in 5 years or so..

1018652,lew,2017-12-01 17:38:00,12766,"My bud's son-in-law raped and murdered a small boy 30 years ago but that's all I'll say about that. My own little brush with bad doods happened in 1963. I was 16 years old and me and a pal were driving down Birchmount Rd. in Scarboro to get a pizza. When we reached Birchmount Arena there were cops,  paddy wagons and bikers everywhere  and there was a huge fight going on in the parking lot. Being the inquisitive type I parked the car to go get a better look even though my friend said to stay in the car. The cops were grabbing everybody and handcuffing them and tossing them in the paddy wagons. Guess I was a bit too close to the fun and they grabbed me, snapped the cuffs on and tossed me in too. They hauled us all up to the Birchmount & Eglinton Ave jail and unloaded us into the cells. Naturally I tried to explain I wasn't a biker, wasn't in the fight and was just a nosey kid but of course the didn't listen. Spent Saturday night in the cells with dozens of bikers and then Sunday morning they loaded us all in the paddy wagons again and off we went to the Old Don Jail where we were finger printed and tossed in more cells. I was charged with ""obstructing police"" and bail was set at $500 which was a huge pile of cash back in 1963. My folks were away for the weekend and couldn't be reached so I called a rich aunt who came down and bailed me out. We went to court a few weeks later and while all the bikers were sent away for extended visits in the ""big house"" the judge believed my tale and all charges were dropped and away I went. I never blamed the cops because it was a full blown riot  down there and several cops were badly injured in the fight they did a great job breaking it up even though they grabbed me. The Old Don Jail was the worst rat hole I've ever been in and sure hope I never experience another weekend like that again."
1018654,AKRISONER,2017-12-01 17:41:00,5558,gotta love the olden days when a fight was still a fight...if that happened today there would have been multiple shooting victims.  I could only imagine being locked up in the Don jail with a bunch of bikers at 16 years old...holy cow how you survived that alone is a feat!

Often it's the hardest road.  I took the right one when I met the woman I have been with for 25 years now. The stupid thing was I wasn't making any money with these guys because I wasn't doing what they were doing but was ""associated"". Many times I excused myself from the table when they started talking business. When they often asked where was I going it old them away from anything you say here because if some information somehow gets out from what is said here you all know it wasn't me. When the s&*t hit the fan they knew it wasn't me that ratted because I had nothing to rat. 5 of that crew are dead now. Those stories stay with me, many are still alive, and fish."
1019308,DJGeneral,2017-12-11 20:46:00,163,Yeah Ironmaker i had to make decision and i chose the right one i also felt as if i could be a target just for hanging with these guys i thank my girlfriend everyday for opening my eyes a bit and steering clear of them!
1019337,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 01:32:00,8243,"You know exactly what I'm saying. I'm not saying I don't miss many of them because I grew up with most of them that I do miss , some were good guys that would do anything for you and still will I bet. They say people don't change but drugs and alcohol will change people."
1018506,Woodsman,2017-11-29 23:30:00,1286,"No one is sugesting you start a forum for a "" place for people to argue and bash each other"". What is being suggested is a place for non fishing discussions subject to forum rules. Now as it is, they appear in the ""General"" area and continue to appear and yes at times get out of line. That way those not interested don't have to scroll past the non fishing posts they are not interested in."
1018508,Woodsman,2017-11-29 23:58:00,1286,"Just looking now the first 4 out of 5 threads have nothing to do with fishing. Ammo, jobs, criminals & hockey are the top 4. Maybe a ""fishing related discussion only place"" is warranted on a fishing forum?"
1018509,aplumma,2017-11-30 00:13:00,6896,"The system of NF has worked for 14 years enjoy the site for what it is one of the friendliest fishing site that topics move quickly on. Many sites have lots of niches and slots for different forums. The more cut up they are the slower the topics move. I saw one site so cut up that it would take up to a week to get something new to read.  Worse is that we have a wealth of information here that would be losted because  people didn't see the threads. If you look at the NF threads most of the time it is either requests for information or telling people of the triumphs and the tragedies that have befallen them. Many times behind the scenes we have had people who have privately helped someone and in a few cases they have been life changing. This is what we are proud of here, this is what makes the time and effort we put into the board worth it all. This is why no one has been banned in 5 years, modQed yes but they can come back if they apologize and follow the rules. This is why you can be proud of being here most everyone has made a few new friends that they would never have bonded to if it was just fishing reports.  The fishing trips that are posted are because they want to share the experiences with his friends and some are close enough to be called family. This is why I am proud to be here and grateful to everyone of the people I have met and will met in the future."

Yes I post NF as well as others, but I do think a NF section is warranted these days. I have seen many regulars leave. New faces show up, and like said, they are gone pretty quick. Do we want lurkers, or do we want members ?  I would like to see a fishing related section. I have been seeing a lot of others sites that are doing their best to go this route.  They have Fishing reports Fishing tactics Fishing tackle and reviews No where is there, where are you fishing. No GPS or exact locations allowed. There is also a seperate place to talk as you wish, but keep it clean and respectful.  From what I gather, Face Book is killing these types of forums. I am not a fan of FB and nor am I going to become  a fan or member of FB. I get my fill through fishing and hunting boards.   And as I click, post, I see there is no changing. Go with the flow. The river flows fast and slow.  I really do believe, a strong fishing section, would be best. JMO. Everyone has NF reports, just nice to have a separate section. JMO    "

We ended up hanging out and chatting at my campfire for a couple hours at night, slamming beers. I would put my beer down on the picnic table and walk to the edge of the bush when I had to pee. Suddenly, like a switch was thrown, I was high as a kite and my head was spinning. I said gonna call it a night, he said ok, good night and disappeared quickly. I stumbled a few steps and collapsed into the dry, desert dirt. I rolled over on my back and I could see the guy standing over me in the flickering fire light, then I passed out. A very weird drug. I was conscious but immobile. I knew what was happening and was sure I was going to get killed or raped but I wasn't panicked, it was as if I was watching it all unfold from outside my body, if that makes any sense.  "

1018534,AKRISONER,2017-11-30 14:52:00,5558,"Chris that is probably one of the scariest stories I have heard. Your comment about him ""practicing"" is friggin terrifying. My best friend was in thailand and got roofied as well. He thinks it was possibly intended for his girlfriend because she gave him her drink. His recollection basically has him getting the drink from his girlfriend and then waking up the next day on the beach, he was missing one shoe and his passport and wallet were stolen. We had a serial killer in Flin Flon growing up, dude was dating an underage girl that was my brothers classmate's sister. Lucky for this little girl she was at school when dude decided to take out her entire family. I think only one of the victims survived. Anyways the family did not approve of the relationship and dude's solution was to get rid of them all and kidnap his girlfriend. He then subsequently had the police on a manhunt for a couple of weeks and the scariest part was that being in Flin Flon, the police locked down the two highways in and out of town almost immediately. Meaning if you took the highway out of town you went through a police stop check where they searched your vehicle. Everyone pretty much knew that this guy that had just shot a whole bunch of people was in the vicinity of town, but no one knew where. There were constant thermo helicopter patrols circling town, Flin Flon is 200k from the nearest town so there was no chance in hell that dude was going to be able to run on foot. Finally a couple of weeks after the murders a worker out at a site heard noises coming from a cement truck on the outskirts of town. He immediately contacted the police and sure enough there was dude with his ""girlfriend"" hiding in the back of cement truck."

1018548,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-30 17:12:00,8243,"Yea, but I have 30 years on you. I do know the per capita crime rates are much higher in the North, that's for sure. We don't hear about it in the media down here. Even here in Haldimand with a population of only 45,000 some crazy stuff happens that don't even make our weekly paper or the news in Hamilton that borders our county. If it happens on any of the 2 reservations it gets reported including Hamilton and sometimes Toronto, but when it happens off the rez often it gets a few lines, maybe. That in itself can be deemed racist."
1018551,manitoubass2,2017-11-30 17:24:00,11391,"Damn! I got caught in some teenage gangbang scuffle in grande prairie and it was scary stuff! All I did was cross the road and two cars started firing on each other and I happened to be in the middle of it. No idea how close but I could hear the bullets so pretty darn close! Also, around age 17-20, my uncle robbed the beer store and did 9 months lol. Worst attempt ever! Broke in the front, couldn't get to the beer, surrendered as soon as he heard sirens (cop shop is like 5 blocks away)  By the way my uncle is super friendly and everyone loves the dood. But, when he was in jail over that beer store incident, he was bunked up with this guy that was like 80's personified. They both were getting out the same day so me and my buddies bought beers. They get home(had zero idea this other dood was coming) and we party. Both them pass out REALLY quick They get up and start drinking again. This weird dood starts getting riled up and he's fighting with my buddy so we kicked his you know what and threw him out 2 days later I hear he was arrested in Duluth Minnesota where he escaped jail (I think in Minneapolis?) For stabbing a guy to death  Also, when heading back to work from fort Frances to grande prairie, I was supposed to take the bus the same day of the beheading on the bus in Manitoba. I just happened to not be ready and delay my ticket by a day. Man you should have seen the security after that!"

1018559,AKRISONER,2017-11-30 18:27:00,5558,this story just shows how messed up people get in their heads when they do something absolutely nuts. Like why bother going through the trouble of wrapping someone up and throwing them off of a bridge into a river when its painfully obvious that someone is going to find the victim within a couple of days. Not to mention believe that you will get away with it and get the insurance money!
1018395,AKRISONER,2017-11-28 19:42:00,5558,"A great thread has sparked up on another bass forum that I frequent. The thread asks about who you may have known that ended up being a hardcore felon or criminal. pretty intriguing and interesting stuff, especially because the majority of people claim that you would never suspect so and so of being a murderer or bank robber etc etc. Personally my uncle has been in and outta the slammer his whole life but his stuff is just from hanging with a tough crowd i.e. bikers etc. and suffering from alcohol addiction. My dad worked with a guy at the mine who ended up murdering another co-worker on the job because ""voices told him to do it"" My dad is still thankful that when it happened it wasnt his shift (he was the safety supervisor) He had already experienced on his first day as a young engineer at the plant what happens when the slag pot ends up getting poured on someone, he said it was something he would prefer to not experience again. Some of the stories though that guys are sharing, one guy's grandfather's moving company got hired by jeffery Dahmer to move...they found out later that he had unknowingly helped Dahmer move a number of bodies from one residence to the next! Another guy met a guy at a gas station on the interstate, hung out with him for a bit and it turned out that very same guy from the gas station was in the process of driving down to Florida with his dismembered wife in the trunk to dispose of her! CRAZY Anyone else have any wild stories? I feel like Iron has known some people lol."

When you are born, raised, educated and worked in Hamilton your entire life until retiring to the country everyone is bound to know both petty and serious criminals. I had more than a few convicted criminals in my crew at the Steel plant. Including arsonists and murderers, nice eh? Back then guys could get early parole if they could get their jobs back at the plant. Years ago my sis in law was called for jury duty for a murder trial. She was very upset because she remembered meeting the accused at my place. All she had to do was mention that at jury selection and the defence couldn't get her out fast enough.  My Fathers moved from Hamilton to Abruzzi Italy when he was 3 years old in 1930 with Nani his 2 brothers and sister. My Grandfather apparently went to College for 15 to 25.  That's all you are getting from me Acree, you are going to have to buy the book when it comes out. The ironic thing about moving away here on the Lake is everyone else from Hamilton thought it was a great idea too. More Hamiltonians in Selkirk than Selkirkians. The voters list looks like a docket at the John Sapinka Courthouse."

1018411,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-28 22:36:00,8243,"Maybe time for a forum for other stuff. I am a member of a serious boating site and they have a forum called ""Dock Side Chat"" where anything other than race, religion, politics and boats are talked about. Just a suggestion.  I'm sure the powers that be have thought about it. I do have empathy for the hardcore fishing guys here that put this site on the map. Perhaps some that were here but left will come back, hopefully."
1018413,Woodsman,2017-11-28 23:22:00,1286,I have no problem with that idea of a separate section for non fishing talk.
1018416,OhioFisherman,2017-11-28 23:33:00,6623,"I got to work one day and they had the parking lot cordoned off with yellow tape and a cop standing guard, everyone had to park in another lot nearby.  I asked the cop what was up with that? You don't know? Dude, I just work here, I know nothing! A couple guys got blown up by a bomb when they started their car."

All our family and his we're friends. One night I went out with a buddy to shoot hoops at like 2am since it was so hot earlier. Got home around 4 ish  Woke up to ambulances and police everywhere. Jamie(my friend) was shot in the guts with a 12 gauge, he said by an old uncle drug addict visiting from the US Turns out he(Jamie) murdered his own parents while they slept in their beds. Then shot himself Google search Jamie perlett fort Frances murders  I've got plenty more but this one was gnarly"

1018444,Garnet,2017-11-29 10:41:00,2056,"I worked in GM Oshawa with 20k in production lot's of story's wife murders, Brinks Robber that his job back after prison . Down at the Ganny guy shot fellow ice fishing friend 11 times. Think the jury didn't believe the reloading part. Part of his condition was he could fish at ganny. We listen to radio reports with him on the trial. Just weird. "
1018445,glen,2017-11-29 10:58:00,2641,This is kind of like the question who would you eat lunch with. How close can you be before you condone it.
1018449,Cast-Away,2017-11-29 13:20:00,790,We must be in between soft water and hard water fishing seasons for threads like this to start up.
1018453,AKRISONER,2017-11-29 14:10:00,5558,"By no means did i mean to offend anyone. In fact this is the rare type of thread where everyone can agree on the subject matter...we all agree that crime is bad...and if you dont you probably are not posting here about it lol I posted the thread in the ""General discussion"" There are threads about hockey and trucks and whatever other stuff, I saw how interesting the other thread on the other forum was, I didnt mean any harm by it here. Its definitely Non Fishing, but its interesting.  Iron that story about your sister would be terrifying, especially if buddy gets off on a technicality! Manitou, are you saying you were playing some B Ball with the dude and then he went home and did the crime? or were you playing with someone else and when you came home you found out something happened?"

1018456,OhioFisherman,2017-11-29 14:53:00,6623,"Actually I was a city - local area - dock man for a number of trucking companies, a few times I even made road trips, although short ones by most standards. The different companies and the way their terminals were located used different definitions of their local areas. Ya, Youngstown and any other place within 100 miles of Cleveland were destinations, it made for long work days. Once you get outside of the tourist destinations any city has it's "" problem areas ""? I didn't get paid to be a tourist, so I saw it all! LOL When you work with 50 - 100 + guys can you really know what some are up to? It's best to limit your involvement?"
1018460,grimsbylander,2017-11-29 15:43:00,3016,Blasphemy!!!! Lol
1018487,aplumma,2017-11-29 20:40:00,6896,"I will say it again we the owners have discussed this in length we are not going to start a forum place for people to argue and bash each other. If it does not fit in a place where anyone can read it then it is being discussed at the wrong forum. If you want to read and bicker religion, political, over the edge topics there are lots of sites that promotes these types of things because they produce lots of views and a bucket of money for the sites. We just spent a wack load of money and countless hours bringing the site current so it is safe and stable for everyone to use. I guess it still is not enough. Remember that we are a family site it is NOT being run for the money but as a place for long time friends to keep in touch and meet new like minded friends.  This thread can go one as long as no one names the person or identifies them in any way  or it goes down hill.  Art"
1018490,grimsbylander,2017-11-29 21:01:00,3016,"Honestly, I don't think anyone really cares if there is or isn't a separate spot for NF and you shouldn't care if it gets mentioned or joked about. Everyone on OFC with regularity appreciates the site and the work that goes in to it. Keep smiling Art, it's all good."
1018491,AKRISONER,2017-11-29 21:02:00,5558,"Thanks Art  absolutely no intention of starting conflict, discussing politics or the like here. The thread on the other forum is now 6 pages in and there has not been a single negative comment or even disagreement yet. Perhaps one of the cleanest big threads I have ever seen. The stories that some of the guys have though holy smokes, shows you how people that you think you know, you dont really know at all! Sometimes i begin to wonder myself, just how close have I come into contact with a dangerous person, when you really think about it it almost guaranteed that youve crossed paths with one even if you dont know it!"
1018499,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-29 21:48:00,8243,"It was just a suggestion on my part. A discussion amongst mature adults need not be immature. I mentioned it because the many sites I frequent are going that way, and I reiterate NO Politics, Religion or member bashing of any kind are allowed there either, and there isn't any of the aforementioned. Things like announcing a new child, a milestone anniversary, a vacation, just non fishing related stuff many guys here do not appreciate and are vocal about it at times. It is called ""General Discussion""  here not ""Fish Discussion"" for a reason I imagine. Just my observation that some here do not appreciate anything non fishing and I get that. If you owners are good with the status quo we are all good."
1018502,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-29 22:14:00,8243,"I have a no show employee at 7PM so I call the home. Kid answers the phone and I ask where is so and so?  Kid starts crying and I get his wife on the phone, she starts bawling and can hardly speak. He was just sentenced to 7 to 10 years for sexual abuse to a minor and the minor was his step daughter. Say what? One of the best guys I had on my crew. He did tree cutting for many guys in the dept. for years, everyone knew him. What are you supposed to say after someone tells you that?  3 years latter my boss, his boss and his boss calls me in to say he will get parole if  we give him his job back and he's going on my shift.  I could have been fired for insubordination after I went off on them, he would be killed on the job if they brought him back to his original dept. Usually the ex cons were shipped to the opposite side of the plant. My managers were Engineers airlifted into their positions from University and no clue how things worked on the floor. I gave them an education as I went through the entire employee list, 10% to 20% at least were ex criminals or criminals with court cases ongoing and or gang members of one ilk or another. We had 12,000 hourly Union employees then and 5000 salaried employees. 400 in our dept. Many of these ex cons claimed Comp after they fell down the stairs unexpectedly. In the 70's and 80's it was The Wild, Wild West there. FishFarmer remembers those days. But nowhere as bad as a plants I went to in Gary Ind. Armed guard escorted you to the restroom, in the main office building. How can one limit involvement when you are their supervisor or manager. I could write a book, oh wait I am."
1018504,GBW,2017-11-29 22:40:00,8460,"When I was 17'ish a guy 2 homes over from me I found out was a BAD MAN.  I'd see his car's not parked right some times (in the snow bank or even on the lawn) and figured he had a few and drove.  He has seen me on my dirtbike so he came over one day and asked me to help him break in his new Ninja 750R so I said sure I'll come get the keys in 1 hour.  I went, went in the house to be brought to the basement to get the helmet and key.  Well that was in a hidden room that had many, MANY gun's and items.  He gave me gas money and said bring it back in two days.  So of course I did what I was asked after seeing what I had seen.  So I show up and he opens the door and said ""come back in after 8pm as I don't want you to meet the people in my house"" yet all I needed to do was hand him the key and helmets.  So again I listened. A few days to a week later I'm trying to get home to my folks place and SWAT had a bunch of trucks there and told me I couldn't get any closer to the area.  I left and called my dad to tell him I won't be there for dinner.  He went out and spoke to them and told my dad (he's an ex-cop) to escort me through the area if I cam back right then and there. I'm now home and in the backyard having a smoke and I hear a voice say ""get in the house now!"" so I  say ""dad I'm just having a smoke"" to get a reply from the other side of the fence saying ""I'm not your dad"" and he flashed a flashlight off and on quickly. So turns out the guy 2 door down went to an Apt building and blew a shotgun hole through a door looking for someone.  Oh and he was a drug lord..."
