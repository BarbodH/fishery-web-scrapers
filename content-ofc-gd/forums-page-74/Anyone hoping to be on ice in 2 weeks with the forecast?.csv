1019965,akaShag,2017-12-19 22:08:00,2073,"My main hard water fishing partner said he heard somebody drowned up north, went through the ice, but he did not know where. We did have some good cold weather here in K-town, but the last couple days have been above freezing and there is a fair bit of snow.  Looks unlikely I will get out before 1 January - and of course there are still 12 days of bow season left! 	Doug"
1019972,Woodsman,2017-12-19 23:44:00,1286,Doug that may have been the incident near Perth. ATV through the ice. 
1019981,irishfield,2017-12-20 01:46:00,26272,"12"" of ice on Cassels Woodsman!"
1019996,AKRISONER,2017-12-20 13:54:00,5558," This makes me feel a lot better about how things went out at our place....i wasnt sure if it was where we were fishing, or if something with the weather had the bite off...i mean it was -20 and crystal clear most of the day so that could be factoring in.  Im glad i get another opportunity Friday Saturday and sunday this weekend to try get it going again."
1020032,Tjames09,2017-12-20 19:14:00,664,Went out on a more northern Kawartha lake. Still 3” mostly. About 1” white 2” black. Made it about 100 yards before spud bar went through on one hit. So it’s only safe for the first 100 yards then it’s paper thin. The warm weather and rain really reversed all the cold we had.
1020034,AKRISONER,2017-12-20 19:39:00,5558,was this today ? you are a brave man 
1020039,Tjames09,2017-12-20 20:42:00,664,"Yesterday. Ya its not really the most safe. Near shore is 4"" and solid, but it gets thin fairly fast. I have a float suit and spud bar my way out.  Im actually hoping that the rain yesterday melted a lot of the snow on the ice and now we have several days of cold weather could really help the lakes."
1020046,AKRISONER,2017-12-20 21:28:00,5558,"if you are desperate head north...its been absurdly much colder north of huntsville than it has been down here.  On sunday morning it was -25 in pointe au baril, but only -11 once i got to barrie an hour later. Not sure why the huge difference but its been substantial. We had a few nights last week that got down to -28...theres a decent amount of ice, much better than what i am hearing from down south."
1020067,MJIG,2017-12-21 00:30:00,227,"The warm, wet day did get rid of most of the snow on some of the Kawartha Lakes but then some new snow fell within 24 hours. There’s a special weather statement out now for 5-10 cm Thursday night and Friday morning (Special weather statement)."
1020068,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-21 00:36:00,10439,No need to panic y'all. This is coming your way.   You're welcome!!!!
1020069,misfish,2017-12-21 00:58:00,29133,"I sure in the hell hope so Dave. My gear is sitting here waiting. I cant stand the ice rods and river ones, yelling at each other. One of them needs to be put a muzzel on. It,s driving me crazy."
1019526,misfish,2017-12-13 23:45:00,29133,"Aint no whities out there me bye. But you know where they are, UP HERE."
1019528,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-14 00:09:00,8243,"Dave, yesterday after we got our 8"", -15C and then the south winds off the lake started drifting it I said and I quote ""I will embrace the winter this year rather than fight it."" Probably because we are flying to Florida at the end of the month and I have an open ticket until March 1st. Tich has 2 weeks off and then flying back. I don't plan on staying too long because I want to open the front door when I return before the locks are changed. Me no stupida. It would be great to get on the lake, it's been years since we had ice here. Buddy built a 5 star ice hotel a few years ago to leave on the ice at St. Williams. Complete with wood stove, solar panels, porta potty, full propane kitchen, bunk bed, 40"" HDTV and HD aerial,  no ice since he built it!! It's still snowing right now and the Lakeshore Rd. here is a mess. I'm trying to stay positive, I'm positive I'm not going out."
1019532,Fish Farmer,2017-12-14 00:48:00,2234,"I hope I make it up just once bro, going through a few health issues."
1019533,Fish Farmer,2017-12-14 00:52:00,2234,"Keeping my fingers crossed Johnny, might get a few St. Williams trips in. Love ice fishing the bay. Only problem is you get a sore neck looking down the hole"
1019534,Joeytier,2017-12-14 01:54:00,3990,"There were a whole bunch of skidoo tracks on the northeast arm today.  I was on 7+"" on a small lake North of Temagami."
1019535,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-14 02:21:00,10439,"Yes, I'm hoping to be on the ice over Christmas. Been too busy to get out of the first 6 weeks of the season!!!!"
1019537,irishfield,2017-12-14 04:50:00,26272,Then they're keeping them pegged.. as my place is within sight of the highway!
1019563,Joeytier,2017-12-14 19:33:00,3990,Don't need much ice when ya got er right to bar I guess...I still had to do a double take when I saw that lol
1019564,AKRISONER,2017-12-14 20:16:00,5558,"you guys are too much ahahhaha I had a year is PSSD where I was on a stake lake but I was totally lost and starting to get low on gas...All i knew was that If i continued north Id run into the C104d trail that runs east west...well wouldnt you know it the stakes stopped...pinned it, and started seeing some really bad ice, those are the days you hope your belt doesnt decide to blow."
1019591,irishfield,2017-12-15 00:55:00,26272,"There was ZERO ice on Midland Harbour on Tuesday, with 2 foot waves. Today, 48 hours later, there are three sled tracks ripping past the coal dock for Port !! Darwin awards coming soon...."
1019624,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-15 16:08:00,10439,Had a guy sink his truck a couple of weeks ago when he drove into open water at night. The spot is known for current and bad ice to all except this mensa candidate.   The guy took the red route (bad) VS the green route (good)  Then there's this guy that drove onto ice in another current area yesterday. 
1019630,Tjames09,2017-12-15 17:04:00,664,"yikes....  well the ice isn't forming that quickly. even with several days of -20 its only 2"" thick and mostly white ice which is very soft. Lots of spots one spud bar hit goes right through. I didn't venture out far."
1019659,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-15 20:51:00,8243,"No way Dave. I hope you are feeling better soon. We bust our Corleones off for 30 plus years in that place, get out in one or two pieces and then we get old. I didn't take a single pill when I took my pension, now I have a box full. Not fair."
1019694,pics,2017-12-16 01:36:00,1268,"I put a thin layer of water on my daughters ice rink last night.. The temperature was - 15 but since it was snowing it was slushy in the morning.. Once I shoveled it, bang.. Frozen!! Snow has incredible insulating qualities.."
1019695,pics,2017-12-16 01:41:00,1268,"Geeze Dave, hope you are feeling better soon.. And I hope the bay freezes this year.. It's a much nicer drive than Simcoe.."
1019718,Fish Farmer,2017-12-16 11:45:00,2234,"Thanks Johnny, still lots of fish to be caught. Thanks Phil, you got that right, St. Williams this year I hope and as you say the Bay for those Walleye."
1019861,pics,2017-12-18 02:31:00,1268,It's not looking good for ice at Long Point with this week's forecast.. There's some out there but it will need some time to thicken up.. Snow cover isn't usually a problem due to the wind blowing it away.. . The last good season for ice was the really cold  year we had in 2014? Or was that 15??
1019868,AKRISONER,2017-12-18 12:37:00,5558,"couple folks were out on little lake yesterday when i was driving through barrie...no idea what the ice was like there. We had 2 inches of solid black ice plus another 2 of grey ice in PAB...ice was a little softer moving out though, but it dropped to -25 over night so things solidified up pretty good. I wouldnt venture very far yet though but it felt great to get out there. The fishing on the other hand was terrible lol. Not sure whats changed from this year to last? Maybe we are just a bit earlier? But last year the weekend of christmas was one fire...this year we fished all day caught 6 perch and 1 pike...rough go. "
1019917,misfish,2017-12-18 22:14:00,29133,"-20 sunday, + 2 today. WTH. Best part is the fluffy snow will get packed down. Calling for rain to add more moisture to the packed snow, then cold again. That will stiffen it up. Thanks for the pic AK."
1019920,misfish,2017-12-18 23:10:00,29133,You called it. Guess the Dragon wasn't  fast enough.

At least the kid in Penetang had some brains, nice picks around his neck!"
1019957,Tjames09,2017-12-19 20:03:00,664,The two days of warm weather really softened up the Kawartha. Already lost the top inch.

But when we tried to get further out, we lost the top 3"", and were left with 1.5"" of black.    That's when I turned tail and ran...  back to my 4.5"". 4 groups out fishing all day.  And not one single fish caught.  But it was a beautiful day on the ice!"
1019960,Woodsman,2017-12-19 21:33:00,1286,A report from Temagami yesterday said that snowmobiles where running on both Snake Island & Cassels lakes. 
1019397,Tjames09,2017-12-12 19:44:00,664,"14 day is showing minus double digits every night, and decent minus degrees during the day. Snowfall might slow down the ice though.  Hoping within two weeks ice will be relatively safe"
1019399,Acountdeleted,2017-12-12 20:11:00,2562,"Simcoe, Cooks and VB will be cutting it close but smaller lakes should be safe very soon."
1019405,Tjames09,2017-12-12 21:07:00,664,Hoping to be up in Huntsville or gravenhurst.  The weather seems cold enough but the amount of snow could make it dangerous and really slow production.
1019407,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 21:14:00,8243,"If the cold keeps up like last night and today Long Point Bay may even freeze, not in 2 weeks but eventually. I hope so.  The thermometer on the lake side deck says -15C."

She froze up last Thursday, but we have had a butload of snow so the ice may be just a pile of slush...We fished last year on 6 inches of slush...it was sketchy as hell lol We have had a couple of nights down to -23 now though, tonights windchill is -33 so hopefully we get enough to sneak out on."
1019415,irishfield,2017-12-12 22:12:00,26272,"Safe ice isn't going to happen anytime soon around Midland / Penetang. This is the hood of my plow truck an hour ago... it was clean after I plowed at 4PM yesterday. The Sound is wide open as of 3pm today.. if it wasn't for the snow I should get the boat down there for Musky on open water!  Temagami I have had no report from Neighbours to say it's safe to sled out to the island, but by Christmas we should be good for a trip! "
1019416,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 22:21:00,8243,"Make sure you don't tie off to the bumper of your vehicle. Someone may get the great idea to go get a coffee in town. Wayne I thought the 8"" we got here last night was too much, that's crazy. More snow last night than all last winter. I think we are in for a Duesenberg this year. I can't wait for the winds to start blowing off the lake. "
1019457,Joeytier,2017-12-13 03:01:00,3990,"People have been ice fishing north of 17 for 2 weeks now.  Big lakes are firming up nicely now, too."

1019468,Acountdeleted,2017-12-13 13:40:00,2562,can you let me know if Stucco is safe? Been meaning to fish that lake for years now. Just always forget/Get distracted by Quinte.
1019471,AKRISONER,2017-12-13 13:45:00,5558,"nothing will be ""safe"" yet but there will be opportunities for the careful and brave."
1019472,Acountdeleted,2017-12-13 13:51:00,2562,That neck of the woods is weird. I was on Quinte on Christmas Eve last year and it was 6 inches of solid ice straight across. I was shocked because cooks was still wide open. 
1019475,chris.brock,2017-12-13 14:12:00,4053," The temperatures are good in cottage country but it's the continual accumulating snow that's not good . The back lake we were at in Haliburton last Saturday had 1 inch of crappy ice, and now there's probably a thick layer of snow on top."
1019479,AKRISONER,2017-12-13 15:03:00,5558,"the difference for us was that the lake didnt even freeze up until last thursday, so i didnt expect any ice...theres a thick blanket of snow now but its been -20 every night and -27 last night. Something has to give! if anything I will be out floating on 6 inches of slush like last year lol literally no solid ice at all. we were able to dig through it using the strainer spoon."
1019481,jimmer,2017-12-13 15:21:00,2730,The snow always ruins my plans for ice fishing over the Christmas holidays. Cold enough but the snow slows down the freeze.
1019483,Fish Farmer,2017-12-13 15:30:00,2234,Next week temps Johnny is in the pluses. I hope we get out there this year.

1019504,irishfield,2017-12-13 20:46:00,26272,Just heard that my neighbour from across the channel on Temagami fell through the ice today trying to walk to my side so I guessing not safe anytime soon. And to think I drove my truck to his island 9 years back to pick him up on Dec 17th!
1019510,Tjames09,2017-12-13 21:24:00,664,"just checked the ice near me. three spud bar hits and broke through. measured about 1.5""-2"". But its ugly ice, surprised its slushy considering its -16 out."
1019512,cisco,2017-12-13 21:46:00,597,Maybe since the freezing water absorbed the overlying snow creating a kinda sponge cake consistency.
1019514,misfish,2017-12-13 22:06:00,29133,Thats the year Terry and I ice fished little lake end of November. That was a great ice fishing season. Ice til Mid April.
1019521,dave524,2017-12-13 23:18:00,4508,Why is everyone giving temps on the Cillyazz  scale and then giving the ice thickness in inches
