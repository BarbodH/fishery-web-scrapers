1020535,turtle,2017-12-31 13:16:00,274,I have a probably 15 year old Jiffy model 3o that ran OK last time used (2015) but is beat up & could use service & replacement parts like the gas tank cap.  Is there a repair shop/dealer  that you could recommend?  I am north east of the GTA.  Thank-you.

1020553,turtle,2017-12-31 17:24:00,274,I got it running fairly easily and it didn't look too bad apart from the gas cap.   Funny how some small engines start up after sitting for two years with zero maintenance (I have a snow blower like that) and some like to be difficult (one of my two Stihl chain saws).  Maybe just a new gas cap.  Looks like I'll be needing the gas auger this year.
