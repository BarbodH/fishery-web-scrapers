Well we still need a bunch of snow as the trails are very rough with many rocks still sticking out of the snow. Guess I'll have to stick to the lakes for a while. The lights work great though so there is some good news. The new light bar is attached to the bumper using bar clamps and is hooked in with the high beams.  I replaced the halogen head ligh bulbs with new LEDs. These are the low beams.  These are the high beams along with the light bar.  Guess I'm ready to sled out to the cabin and maybe drill a few holes now. Well after I get the hut and tackle ready. "

1020249,Rod Caster,2017-12-23 21:22:00,5784,Guys 30 years ago wouldn't believe the quality of some headlights (or lightbars) nowdays. My stock '98's headlight was considered 'good' at the time; now it would be considered dangerous.
