Send me a PM if you're looking for someone to walk out with (safety in numbers and all) I have all my own gear and a one man flip FYI. Good luck on the ice this weekend all! Dutch"

1020446,crappieperchhunter,2017-12-29 18:14:00,2582,Check your Pm's Dutch. I'm going somewhere tomorrow as the boss is working. Can't stay home on a free fishing day.
1020447,Dutch01,2017-12-29 19:04:00,1431,Done!
1020518,Dutch01,2017-12-30 21:35:00,1431,"So my bro in law and I met up with fellow OFC'r crappieperchhunter this morning in PB. Always nice to meet up with other board members to fish. We started out at 25' and found 7-8"" of good ice. There were lots of sleds and atv's out (not a recommendation!).  the action was slow at first, just a few dinks here and there. After awhile crappieperchhunter decided to go look for the fish, while the lazier among us decided to wait for the fish to come to us. Neither strategy worked out the well sadly with 3 keepers in total, but hey, it was a day of fishing, who's  complaining? Not me."
1020519,Dutch01,2017-12-30 21:37:00,1431,"No fish worth photographing, but here's the view from my new flip. Which I love. But daaamn it's heavy..... "

1020523,Dutch01,2017-12-30 21:59:00,1431,Touche!
