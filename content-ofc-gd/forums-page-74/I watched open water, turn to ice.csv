1020369,misfish,2017-12-27 18:50:00,29133,-19 this morning and I was lucky enough to watch one of natures wonders. Open water turned to ice.   
1020370,Terry,2017-12-27 18:53:00,14456,bring on opening day
1020373,manitoubass2,2017-12-27 20:24:00,11391,"i get to watch this every year on rainy river and it never gets old. i watched last night, was -47 here. it was forming very quick and the sounds are so cool!"
1020374,irishfield,2017-12-27 21:17:00,26272,"I can't believe the lack of snow 35 miles away! There'll be no safe ice up here anytime soon...  I've been plowing daily for the past week. Christmas day was 16"" of fairly light stuff and yesterday was 12"" of heavy compacted snow that came down similar to sleet. Almost thinking I live in PA right now!! That's my matching plow truck under there.. see the mirror.. "
1020379,captpierre,2017-12-27 22:56:00,2521,Won’t be long now for you Simcoe hard water types
1020381,Fish Farmer,2017-12-27 23:47:00,2234,"Hey Bro,  your starting to look like Terry, it's not the beard that catches, it's the technique that catches. Terry, don't tell him, the Noof will figure it out. Happy new year guys."
1020382,Terry,2017-12-27 23:53:00,14456,lol 
1020384,Fisherman,2017-12-28 13:04:00,7201,"Well if it ain't froze by now, it never will, -34/39 here this morning.  Brass nuts cold. Just looked at the Barrie cam, white as far as you can see.  https://www.barrie.ca/City Hall/Webcams/Pages/default.aspx"
1020390,misfish,2017-12-28 14:44:00,29133,Seems the whole lake has tighten up. Opener looks promising. Here whitey whitey .
1020391,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-28 14:57:00,8243,"I have seen it form many times here in the last 21 years, including yesterday and today, I kind of take it for granted. 3 hours since there was a skim along the shore it is all water now with ice further out about a mile. Smooth as a skating rink which isn't common here, slight offshore or no winds and sub zero temps. The coolest thing to see and hear is the giant moguls that form along the shore melt in spring. It sounds like shards of glass sliding into a dumpster. If you watch the hour hand on a clock closely you will see it move too. Brudder, you better get back to work soon before you start watching a clock. Happy New Year to all."
1020392,NAW,2017-12-28 15:13:00,4022,I am officially getting excited for some K-Bay fishing!!
1020394,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-28 16:34:00,8243,About this time tomorrow we should be disembarking the plane at the Miami Int. Airport. I won't go fishing until Saturday. I have a charter booked with my new Brother In Law out of Isla Mirada in the Keys for the 2nd with an option for the 3rd.  I have more tackle packed than clothing. Everything I need to wear is at Walmart. You guys ice fishing don't forget the Sunscreen.
1020398,misfish,2017-12-28 17:01:00,29133,"Oh great, now I need to have eyes in the back of my head. LOL  Check yer cell on the weekend bud. Always good to have numbers when testing the ice."
1020402,NAW,2017-12-28 18:57:00,4022,"Saw to guys today on my lunch break try to go out on Kemp.  They parked at the Go Stn and walked across.  Tried to get on the ice by where all the ducks hang about between the tiffen st launch and the south shore center...  Anyone who has walked the water front knows that little patch stays open all year.....  They didn't go far, then turned back..  No floater suites.  No rope..  Donkeys.."
1020403,Fisherman,2017-12-28 19:10:00,7201,"No, the word starts with an A."
