1019328,Fisherman,2017-12-11 23:05:00,7201,Why?
1019348,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 03:15:00,8243,"You got that right Terry, I don't know about everyday but, I did a 3 week job in England 5 years ago and put on 2500 miles. Some folks I met said they don't put 2500 miles on their cars in a year. Having a car in Europe is a luxury not a need like e do. Then again there are countries you can drive from one side to the other in a few hours or less, like England. Nova Scotia isn't too much different. They plan for 2 days to drive 2 hours across the Province. B-I-L from Halifax flipped when I had to go pay a bill in Hamilton, a short 45 minute drive, he couldn't believe it. When he saw the line of red tail lights on the cars in bumper to bumper traffic at night on the 401 coming from Pearson he wanted to go home. It must be something for someone that has never seen TO traffic to see for the first time. He must have taken 50 pictures and texted them home by the time we went a mile."
1019363,pics,2017-12-12 13:40:00,1268,I always replace the rims and tires at the same time because my white rims usually have a lot of paint peeling after 6 years.. That and it's almost cheaper to buy a set of mounted tires ready to go..
1019378,glen,2017-12-12 15:39:00,2641,The two on my trailer are galvanized but my spare is white.  I want to change them all out and get radials.  But I ain’t doing it till the tires need replacing.
1019476,bigbuck,2017-12-13 14:13:00,2449,Just get it repaired properly. Spend the 30 bucks. It's piece of mind. Doing it half arsed will end up stressing you while pulling it around because you will begin thinking about the bloody tire. Slime is meant to be a temporary fix. It is not meant to last for a couple of years.
1019522,ch312,2017-12-13 23:23:00,1590,"Actually, many people put the stuff in their tires to prevent flats from happening in the first place. I think it's good for 2 years in the tire..."
1019543,DanD,2017-12-14 12:05:00,2223,"Yea I've seen this as well and I have had to listen to people complain, when I tell them that this tire repair has just tripled in price. Cleaning that stuff out of the tire, would easily be compared to trying to wipe baby crap off a blanket. If the tire isn't 100% clean, the proper repair of a patch will not adhere to the tire. Dan."
1019545,Garnet,2017-12-14 12:52:00,2056,This could be as simple as a value stem leak. Would take about 20  seconds to diagnose take cap off and some saliva on finger put it on valve stem. Look bubbles. If you can't diagnose the problem just pay.
1019823,ch312,2017-12-17 17:22:00,1590,"Slime = hard to clean Tire Ject = super easy Guys I know run the stuff in off roading truck tires and ATV's, not road vehicles. It's pointless running in road tires as the odds of a puncture are so low and adding some sealant and air on the side of the road is usually a non issue.  Out of curiosity, why is it necessary to charge 3x the price? I have patched two slimed tires from the inside and just cleaned the slime from about 1/4 worth of the tire and the patches didn't leak for a few years before the truck was sold. Added about 5 minutes to the process."
1019842,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-17 20:49:00,8243,A piece of sand paper and a can of Tremclad and you have some toonies left over to buy more tackle pics.
1019857,pics,2017-12-18 01:57:00,1268,I can go to the Hitchman on Grimsby mountain where premounted tires are cheaper than just buying tires and paying to have them mounted. I don't have a big fancy boat.. Just a 14 footer... My enclosed trailer will need tires in a year or so and I will go there as well.. If you have ever tried to paint those white spoked rims you would know what a pain in the arse it is to make them look decent..
1019864,DanD,2017-12-18 11:34:00,2223,"The minute I touch that tire, to perform a repair, I am libel (sp?); if that repair fails. So every bit of that crap gets washed out, so that a proper inspection can be performed. If I'm taking on whatever job for a customer; its done to the best of my ability or we don't do it. The customer is informed of the extra cost involved and then it's their choice to allow me to continue. Dan."
1019876,Loonietoon,2017-12-18 14:26:00,1450,Well said and put Dan. Like you said they will come back with a LAWYER OH YA
1019889,ch312,2017-12-18 15:50:00,1590," True, I wasn't looking at it from that angle and it's honest to inform the customer up front.  How often do you see this Slime or other sealants in street vehicle tires? Have you any experience with TireJect, which is a whitish color and more fluid than Slime? I've played with both a few times and Slime will/should be obsolete when TireJect starts gaining ground and taking market share. Slime and other similar products have made many people strongly dislike these sealants which makes it harder for a better product to gain ground as the stigma of tire sealants being a huge PITA is already there.  I threw a brand new bottle of Slime in the garbage after trying Tireject. I couldn't bring myself to give that crap away...."
1019915,glen,2017-12-18 21:31:00,2641,the tire on the Bush buggy is holding it’s going to get a workout with all the snow.  Just filled the back tires on my car. Only three more tires to do.
1019939,pics,2017-12-19 13:23:00,1268,I have a bush buggy and the tires leak from cracks in the sidewall..if I can find a cheap tube I might go that route but otherwise the hitchman sells those tires for a great price.. tire sealant might not work on a cracked sidewall...
1019138,glen,2017-12-09 18:36:00,2641,Slow leak boat trailer tire around the rim.  Anyone use green slime?  I see it’s about $50 for 3.78l at crappy tire.  Does it put the tire out of balance a lot?   Does the repair last?  Does it work every time? I have burnt out a bunch of 12volt tire pumps over the years.  When you want to jump in and go it sucks to have to wait for a tire to fill up.
1019139,lew,2017-12-09 19:13:00,12766,Why not just buy a new rim & tire Glen and be done with the aggravation ?
1019140,Garnet,2017-12-09 19:14:00,2056,Is it a rim leak or do you have a nail in it. Get  a spray bottle water and dish soap and find out.
1019141,Woodsman,2017-12-09 19:15:00,1286,The tire shop will hate you if you bring in a tire after ading Slime. Maybe consider have the tire shop add a tube.
1019144,ketchenany,2017-12-09 19:21:00,3229,I had a snowblower with the same problem. Tube did it and that was 20+ years ago.
1019145,dave524,2017-12-09 19:28:00,4508,"I burned out a few of those, do yourself a favour and get a small compressor for not a lot more money, you'll find it handy for a lot of other thing than just inflating tires even with out airtools , cleaning air conditioners, vacuums and other dust collectors."
1019149,glen,2017-12-09 20:35:00,2641,I’m going to put new rims and tires on in 2or3 more years. Just want to limp it till then.  Now that I count them  I’ve got about six other slow leaks on off road buggy’s and trailers.
1019156,Fisherman,2017-12-09 22:51:00,7201,"Unscrew the valve core, pop the bead, I use a couple of big wood clamps.  Get some 0000 steel wool and shine up the bead surfaces on the rim, both sides, no need to take off the tire.  spread a really thin coat of petroleum jelly(vaseline or pam) on the tire beads and re inflate and replace the valve core.  Slime is only for emergencies.  If you do use a tube make sure it's whatever the tire is, radial or bias ply."
1019158,misfish,2017-12-09 23:07:00,29133,"Oh Glen, what to do with you ? LOL"
1019159,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-09 23:17:00,8243,"No, no, no. Those trailer tires are more important to be of a fit condition than the tires on your tow vehicle. You sound like my 90 year old Father. Buy them now or at least a new tire and rim at least for God's sake. The only limping you may be doing is on the broken leg you received in an accident. Hopefully that's not all. You are smarter than that Glen. Of course I have a story. I was about 18 and my brother and I shared a 69 VW Beetle with Dad. The tires were Baldinis. There was a used tire place on Gage Ave. and Lawrence Rd. In Hamilton. Went in with Dad and he wanted used tires, for 5 bucks each as advertised on the sign. The guy told him he could put 4 used on for ""50 bucks all in"", my dear Father says, "" Come on, they are only for my Boy's to use!"" I swear on his 90 1/2 year life."
1019163,Garnet,2017-12-10 00:24:00,2056,I use hair spray on the bead and rim. Tie a rope around  tire and with a large screwdriver wrap rope until bead tight on rim hit with air. Find leak first spray bottle dish soap.
1019170,Pikeslayer,2017-12-10 01:29:00,1443,Why would you knowingly trailer your rig with a defective tire/rim in order to buy 2 or 3 more years @ the risk of innocent others when you potentially blow a tire ?? Sorry to say but that sounds totally irresponsible to me  Youre putting others @ risk!!!
1019181,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-10 05:13:00,8243,"Exactly. If you insist on being cheap that's your call but if you insist on towing with poor trailer tires and injure someone I care for I will hunt you down like a dog Glen, maybe if someone I don't even know.  Come on man that is just being stupid! If you do injure someone like innocent children for example you deserve sleepless nights for a very long time wondering if your 300 pound cell mate is asleep. What is really surprising to me are there are responsible guys here suggesting fixes for a bad wheel and or tire."
1019183,glen,2017-12-10 06:38:00,2641,Well the boat tire only needs air about once a month so it’s a pretty slow leak. I could put the spare on but the rims are a different colour. Does that matter. As you can’t see both sides at the same time  lol. Maybe I’ll slime some  of the off road tires and see how that goes. I wonder if there is a stay in foam that goes solid 
1019184,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-10 07:45:00,8243,OK I'm tapping out.
1019196,barrystrs,2017-12-10 13:41:00,75,"It does not say anywhere that the tire is in poor condition!  If there are no cracks and there is tread left with no visible defects, add slime.  It works great,  I usually only add about half of how much it recommends on the bottle.  I have had a nail hole in a riding lawnmower that the slime was coming out, then I didn't need to add air for 2 years. It comes on sale a couple of times a year at crappy tire."
1019207,DanD,2017-12-10 17:34:00,2223,"How old are the tires? If they're any older then 7 years old; you should think about getting them off the road. In many European countries, it is law that a tire 5 years old must come off and there's talk of that coming here.                       Here's a pic and a description of how to read the date code. If by chance the date code on your tires are 6 digits; you know its 10 plus years old.  If the tires are young enough; take them into a garage and have them repaired.  For rim leaks we take the tire off the rim, wire wheel the rust away from the bead and valve stem areas. Apply a bead sealer (liquid rubber)  to the cleaned rim and install a new valve stem. $15.00. For a puncture, we do all the same as above; along with patching the tire from the inside. $20.00                                                                                                                                                                                        With both repairs, we can check the tire's condition inside. A tire driven half flat (even only 1 klick) will chew out the sidewall; right down to the cords and you cannot tell from the outside. So you're willing to chance turning your trailer into a drag-er for 15 or 20 bucks? Sorry but that's back assward thinking. Dan."
1019221,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-10 21:54:00,8243,"I nearly killed us both on HWY 11 near Sundridge going up north over 30 years back. I had a slow leak on the front right and was too lazy to repair it properly, put in a can of that fix a leak crap. The belt ripped right off the tire . From the belt slapping inside the fender it tore the fender up until it wrapped itself around the CV joint at 120KPH. No control whatsoever. Ended up in the oncoming traffic ditch. I learned my lesson. A tire with a slow leak is a tire that needs to be repaired properly or replaced. After seeing my life pass before my eyes I was and still am anal about tire pressure. Besides that tires aren't cheap and keeping them at the proper tires pressure saves money for many reasons including fuel savings and longevity. My take is a tire with a slow leak is a tire in bad condition Barry."
1019237,glen,2017-12-11 00:45:00,2641,I got a 3l or whatever  size the big jug is.  Easy to use I did a tire on my trail buggy.  She was fun today in all the snow the slime reminds me of the blood from predator.
1019284,Mister G,2017-12-11 15:53:00,1429,Just buy new tires every spring with a  collection from those who are so concerned.  . . . . .
1019295,ch312,2017-12-11 18:34:00,1590,"Try some TireJect It's the same idea as Slime, but is so much better and advanced that it makes Slime seem like an old obsolete product from 50 years ago. Less product is used, seals bigger holes, much easier cleanup, and just better in every way. Works awesome for sealing beads that just won't seal. A few buddies have been using it in their truck and ATV tires and the stuff is unbelievable. No issue running a tire with a slow leak as long as you keep an eye on the pressure and there is no heavy cracking, bulging, etc."
1019297,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-11 18:48:00,8243,"I know for a fact in Italy a vehicle must go through a very intensive safety check every 5 years, less if a commercial vehicle. Far more detailed than our safeties here in On. You don't see many if any vehicles over 7 years old in many European countries. The cars that don't make the cut are sold en mass to Africa, India and 3rd World nations. Compared to many European countries some cars and many commercial trucks we have on the roads here make us look like a 3rd World country. It's one of the first things visitors from there comment about. The driving conditions in Europe is by far more difficult than here in Canada. 2 vehicles share on roads in mountain regions that don't have enough room for 2 North American cars or especially trucks. Picture driving in the Rockies every day or super highways like the Autobahn in Germany or the Autosrada in Italy without speed limits. You better have good tires to get home alive there. I'm sure we all know guys that have 4 different makes of tires on their old hoopdies."
1019305,Terry,2017-12-11 20:12:00,14456,I know people here that drive farther to work and back every day then some Europeans drive every year lol
1019310,Fisherman,2017-12-11 20:50:00,7201,"That's cuz they're taking the scenic route in and out of ditches, through the rhubarb patches and everywhere else except the road.."
1019325,pics,2017-12-11 22:38:00,1268,I don't take chances with a tire that has cracks along the tread lines but if there aren't any and its simply a slow leak then I would use the slime.. Trailer tires and rims usually have to be replaced at the same time unless they are the fancy aluminum or galvanized ones. One thing that I started to do is to put old tires and rims on the trailer in the off season so I can store the good tires indoors.. The frequency of new tires also depends on if you are traveling on the highway versus secondary roads..
