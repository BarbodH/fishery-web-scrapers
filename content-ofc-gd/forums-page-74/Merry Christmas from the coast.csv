1020318,BITEME,2017-12-26 03:14:00,1968,All good Brian certainly has us thinking of a generator back up I have a welder generator but it’s dirty power the fridge runs in waves  leave it up long enough to cool down some more  and not enough unf for the water pump having to hand bomb water  all in all it could’ve worse so a good  5000+ watt Honda generator and switch will be going in very quickly to power necessaries http://outagemap.nspower.ca/external/default.html power is  down across Nova Scotia looks like we will be down till Wednesday dinner time any body that wants to pipe in on generator back up feel free I’m way open to suggestions like I said I will be moving on this very quickly cheers peter brian if I put them on the line I’d be looking for them mid Atlantic someplace
1020319,BITEME,2017-12-26 03:22:00,1968,Keep in mind guys I want to keep this around the $5000 mark just basics water pump water heater fridge possibly the heat pump and some lights as a way out  the washing machine thanks 
1020320,lew,2017-12-26 09:38:00,12766,If you've got natural gas or propane at your place Pete a permanent stand-by generator is the way to go. They hook-up to a separate panel in your home and when the power goes out they automatically fire up and when the power comes back on they go back into stand-by mode until the next time it's required & no need to keep filling them with gas either. Also remember that if your power is out the gas stations in your area my have no power either. I installed a Generac about 7 years back and it was some of the best money I ever spent and it sure is reassuring knowing when the power goes out at 20 below in the dead of winter everything continues to work normally. You can get smaller units to run a few items or you can get huge units to run your entire house. Just a thought for you. 
1020325,BITEME,2017-12-26 14:21:00,1968,Thanks Lew appreciate the response no natural gas here and propane could be an option would need to get a tank hooked up we will be looking at it this week and have been eyeballing generacs If you don’t mind can you message me what it cost you just the generator and the panel propane may be the way to go as a back up On another note     Lew I hope all is well for you and your wife and that you are enjoying a well deserved retirement I wish you great health and happiness. Merry Christmas Lew!!! cheers peter
