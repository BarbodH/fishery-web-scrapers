1020510,LostAnotherOne,2017-12-30 20:34:00,956,Just a question bud.  My bro and i are in a tournament in february on kemp and was wondering what would you use for bait to catch pike?  Biggest fish wins so i dont even want any perch even if its 15 inches. Planning on using a swedish pimple with a minnow head attached to it.
1020512,Terry,2017-12-30 20:56:00,14456,it was fun here is my take on it  
1020513,misfish,2017-12-30 21:16:00,29133," I fished the first one. 8"" perch won me a chain saw. Pike, yer going to have to have a Horse Shoe. Perch,white fish, herring and lakers. Even smelt, and they won a prize as well. Dont over think. Im on the fence to fish it this year.  We always have a good time buddy. Thanks for hanging"
