Seems like a really nice floater especially for the price. They had about 8 of them in inventory. Lots of other Rapala stuff as well, including some of their cheaper float rods like Shift for $125 and Classics fpr $50. The Classics are brutes but probably good for Chinooks. They even have Classic baitcast floatrods for $50. Heavy my mom hates me though."
