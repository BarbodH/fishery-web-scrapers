1020194,Joeytier,2017-12-23 00:51:00,3990,They can be an absolute blast when you can get onto them.  We try to go a couple times each winter.  Heavy glow spoons and half a shiner on bottom (or very close) catches pretty much every one for me.  Always fun!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oycyJPhlPjw&t=103s 
1020195,Joeytier,2017-12-23 00:53:00,3990,"Okay folks, what's the (probably obvious) secret to embedding content on the new layout?  The old Youtube embed codes seem to be obsolete?"
1020197,Acountdeleted,2017-12-23 01:23:00,2562,Nicely done bud.  Loce catching em. Love eating em but haven't had a ton of success in the past. I'll have to find a good lake for them in the future.
1020199,EC1,2017-12-23 01:33:00,930,Nice! Thanks for sharing. Do between 5-10 trips for them a year once the ice is ready. Looks like you’re fishing fairly shallow for them! I myself have found areas but haven’t really come across a night where it’s non stop.
1020200,Terry,2017-12-23 01:34:00,14456," you had the link to the page, yoi need the link to the video  "
1020201,misfish,2017-12-23 01:35:00,29133,Nice going. What he said DANG WERE QUICK.
1020206,Joeytier,2017-12-23 02:26:00,3990,"I was in about 20 feet, but very close to a deep trough."
1020216,Rod Caster,2017-12-23 13:37:00,5784,"Yeah they were really ON that night. When fishing in daylight isn't enough, go ling fishing! Nice video."
1020227,Headhunter,2017-12-23 15:39:00,5703,That looks like a ton o fun! Thanks for sharing... anyone got a recipe? HH
1020228,manitoubass2,2017-12-23 15:41:00,11391,"Nice!  I hammer em at night(actually never caught one in daylight)  20-25 fow off a mudflat, when the walleye bite dies the ling turn on!  Super fun, I just hate the dinks that barely move the rod tip and by the time you check your lure it's wrapped the line 1000 times around itself lol"
1020231,BillM,2017-12-23 16:42:00,17367,I've got two this year while vertical jigging lakers.    Really cool looking fish but you gotta fizz them or they'll never make it back down from deep water.  
1020236,Joeytier,2017-12-23 17:36:00,3990,"Cool!  Guess they'll occupy the same waters as lake trout in the summer, they just can't regulate their bladders.   Ive never fished for them in more than 25 feet."
1020238,BillM,2017-12-23 17:50:00,17367,That one was from over 100ft if I'm not mistaken.  Smashed my jigging rap like crazy lol.
1020241,misfish,2017-12-23 18:36:00,29133,"Fizz ? When and if I get one, it,s going to be steamed and smothered in garlic butter, with a side of hot sauce. Thanks Bill. I will be looking forward to getting one now, that they will hit a rap. "
1020256,moose,2017-12-23 23:44:00,266,we used to use tip up with spreader and minnows
1020257,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-24 00:03:00,10439,Fizz is the sound they make when you drop them in boiling oil!!!
1020260,Pikeslayer,2017-12-24 01:53:00,1443,My one & only....
1020261,NAW,2017-12-24 01:55:00,4022,Thats a great Video!  Looks like an absolute blast!
1020266,Joeytier,2017-12-24 14:02:00,3990,A spreader is a good idea...ill have to try that sometime
1020271,Woodsman,2017-12-24 15:40:00,1286,I learned one important thing. When fishing in a hut only one line per angler. If someone hooks one everyone else get their lines out ASAP otherwise your fishing halts until the tangled mess is dealt with.
