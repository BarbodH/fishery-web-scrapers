He's looking for water proof (or at least very water resistant) boots. Non, or thin insulation. The issue is finding something that fits over his calves so the muck style boots haven't worked.  Thnks"

1020417,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-29 00:11:00,10439,I have Rocky gortex hunting boots. They aren't as high as rubber boots but are higher than hikers. A mid calf design. And they lace up so are adjustable on the calves. Mine are similar in design to these but mine are no longer made as I have had them since the 90's. The ones I have also have more insulation then these but you asked for little insulation and these are the lowest @ 200 grams of thinsulate. http://www.rockyboots.com/rocky-mens-boots/rocky-bearclaw-3d-gore-tex-waterproof-200g-insulated-outdoor-boot/FQ0009237.html?dwvar_FQ0009237_color=20#prefn1=productFeatures&sz=12&start=13&prefv1=20&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyZLSBRDpARIsAH66VQKgOtANm1dmwarrBpQvaIja_iF9sDRGDNGz8QN9nzk5CrPy4bbPYF0aAoEeEALw_wcB&kwid=34592641x15637065787x250866187
1020453,kickingfrog,2017-12-29 20:09:00,8333,I'll pass along the info. As it turned out I was in Canadian Tire in the south end today and saw these:   They might be the compromise that he needs.

1020486,dave524,2017-12-30 14:12:00,4508,"I've always worn boots of the LL Bean boot style for early upland game hunting, 10 inch non insulated, bottoms are good for wet situations but little ankle support if in hilly country, best on level ground.
