569251,highdrifter,2011-04-05 20:33:00,2534, That's an 11'6 meat stick that I use for chucking hardware..  Nothing like big river lakers to put some arc into it!!  thanks brah.
569253,highdrifter,2011-04-05 20:37:00,2534," Yep, darkest ever fish for me.  This lake is reputed to have really dark fish..  Water is crystal clear too.  She might have been a deep roamer.."
569254,highdrifter,2011-04-05 20:39:00,2534, Thanks bud.  Big G couldn't make it out that time.  He's been having great success though..  Maybe he'll indulge us a little!
569255,misfish,2011-04-05 20:41:00,29133,Sweet pics HD.  Truely enjoyed. TFS.
569257,highdrifter,2011-04-05 20:41:00,2534,Thanks for all the replies guys..  More to come!
569381,l2p,2011-04-06 01:13:00,346,Gotta love the niagara! nice feesh.
569384,Rattletrap2,2011-04-06 01:20:00,1652,Beautiful fish and even better pictures! Thanks for  posting. I'm absolutely drooling!
569434,steelie hunter,2011-04-06 02:41:00,55,"Quite the catch, gotta love the trout trifecta (browns/lakers/bows). Does that first one have a clipped dorsal fin? Stray NY fish?"
569466,highdrifter,2011-04-06 04:44:00,2534, Yep dorsal was clipped by the looks of it..  Which is a shame.  Didn't seem to affect it much.  I suppose the fish would have to learn to compensate quickly.  She sure was well fed.
569467,Jet,2011-04-06 04:52:00,364,Love the variety of species HD. Great stuff.
569827,WeedLine,2011-04-07 02:21:00,322,Great fish and pics there Fidel. Some real beauties
569871,Moosebunk,2011-04-07 08:06:00,3970,Solid winter dood!  Great pics.  I like seeing the Niagara lakers caught that way.
568859,highdrifter,2011-04-04 02:34:00,2534,"Hey gang,  Been a great winter. I'll let the pics do the talking.         Quillback      Berkley Ripple Shad with a 1/4oz jighead... deadly.          This big durtie followed right in...  I dropped again and she crushed it right at my feet.    One for Mark too..    He couldn't be happier..      Got into these trouts while chasing poikes..      Some darker, smaller, prettier lakers..          eelpout!    A PB for my brother in law.    My first Toronto pike through the ice!    Wallacio with a prime fish.  Good to meet you brother.      Almost stepped over this guy.  He munched away just feet from me as I was drifting..    Be safe out there.  cheers HD"
