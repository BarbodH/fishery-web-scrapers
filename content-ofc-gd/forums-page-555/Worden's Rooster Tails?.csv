568837,Eazy,2011-04-04 01:44:00,260,"I've got a few of these in my box, look to be fantastic little spinners as to regarding overall appearance, but, for the life of me, can't seem to get the blade spinning while retreiving?????......Is it just me or is this a common problem with these baits?"
568888,Roy,2011-04-04 03:31:00,13728,Are you sure they're authentic Wordens? I've got a whackload of them and they all work flawlessly.
568906,solopaddler,2011-04-04 10:49:00,8605,"IMO that's a common problem with that blade style. One of my favourite spinners for trout, I've got tons of them, but you really have to give them a sharp tug to get the blade spinning.  I've found not using a snap swivel helps immensly for whatever reason."
568907,singingdog,2011-04-04 11:05:00,1047,"Solo is right, no swivel will help get them started....that works with all spinners. Last year, I canned the roostertails I had  because I was sick of jerking on them to get them to start spinning."
568909,bushart,2011-04-04 11:23:00,2628,Beauty spinner though---those and panther martins---have caught lots for me
568953,Mike Pike,2011-04-04 14:21:00,1332,Do you find problems with line twist when you don't use a swivel with the roostertails Solo?
568957,solopaddler,2011-04-04 14:44:00,8605, Yes.
569354,mbac31,2011-04-06 00:04:00,904,"Wordens lures are awesome, Im sponsored by them infact. I use them all the time and find that they need to be used on very light line and have to be tugged to get them started usually. I find that if I place a saporo barrell swivel on it first it tends to stop the line twist and makes them run better."
569357,solopaddler,2011-04-06 00:10:00,8605,"  Do you put the barrel swivel on the lure Marvin?  I neglected to mention earlier when I'm fishing with Rooster Tails as mentioned I tie the line directly to the lure but usually run a barrel swivel inline about a foot and a half above the spinner.  Side note, check your pm's."
569442,Eazy,2011-04-06 03:06:00,260," Funny you should mention that......looked at the package yesterday and it said to do exactly that, but once you get them spinning do you have to really burn 'em in fast to keep the blade spinning?"
569585,Beans,2011-04-06 16:02:00,3339,I gots a friend down in Alabama that swears by Worden's Rooster Tails...his favorite is the Green Coach Dawg...
