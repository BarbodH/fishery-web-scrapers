569715,Tybo,2011-04-06 21:55:00,1373,"basically to make sure the tach and engine is reading the same. Not changing my oil this year. sample from last change came back good. Will change the plugs,Like every year."
569719,irishfield,2011-04-06 21:59:00,26272,I'm the other way.. I blow the $100 on oil (now down to $72 with the Verado specific out now) and my plugs are original. They fire fine... they're not electrode worn. Oil takes a beating in a Supercharged engine running 225F oil temps on every run.
569726,Tybo,2011-04-06 22:07:00,1373,You put alot more hours on.I likly have less then 100 hours from last change.
569747,aplumma,2011-04-06 22:51:00,6896,  I am surprised that they run that hot. I have (2) 318 inboard motors that will not get up to 180F at 4000 rpm but they are made different than an outboard. I know on all of my turbo charged cars they have a beefed up cooling circuit on the water and oil coolers that are in the water jacket to get the heat out before it does damage.    Art
569752,irishfield,2011-04-06 22:58:00,26272,"OIL is usually 222/223 Art, after any significant run. Not a real issue. Even in my aircooled aircraft engines I don't get worried unless I go past 250F. I find with Supercharged engines that the oil gets black/dirty faster than conventional engines. I found that back in my 6-71 blower days and in my '90 TBird SC, as I do now with my Verado. Suprised that Paul isn't seeing this if he has 100 hours on his... I don't put 100 hrs on mine most summers and mine was black when I drained it in October."
569795,Tybo,2011-04-07 00:32:00,1373,When I checked the oil in Dec  it was a dark tan colour.The oil I sent to the S.O.S lab last year was a darker brown and it checked out O.K. When I'm running higher speed 40-50mph it's only for 15 minutes or so. 90% of the time I let the super charger cool down before I shut the engine down.
569799,Rombo,2011-04-07 00:42:00,39,Oil is cheap insurance. I change my outboards every 50 hours or so. My truck gets changed every 5000km even though i use full synthetic in every thing and quality filters.  I put the same castrol 10w30 in every four stoke i own. It goes on sale at CT at least twice a year and i will buy 15 liters at a time.
569803,Tybo,2011-04-07 00:55:00,1373,Change the oil in my truck at 7000km. Use a blend from Hamilton(can't remember the name right now) Same 15-40 we use in the equipment at work.Trucks almost 9 years old.
569153,chromermo,2011-04-05 00:53:00,2,Need to service my Mercury 75EFI 4 stroke but have no idea where to take it or how much is the total cost. Any ideas?Sugestions?
569156,Roy,2011-04-05 00:59:00,13728,You can't take it to where you bought it?
569158,dhickey,2011-04-05 01:06:00,1038,sounds like you need to find a good mechanic? where do you  live/  better yet what area is close to you boat? im shure somone would be able help you out.
569166,chromermo,2011-04-05 01:23:00,2,Live in Toronto. Just wondering how much should I expect for this kind of service. Willing to drive to Simcoe or Scugog area. First time doing this.
569178,steelhedrmatt,2011-04-05 01:44:00,278,"If the motor's not under warranty still, Its quite easy to do yourself."
569181,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-05 01:48:00,4399, What year is it?what service are you looking for?
569182,irishfield,2011-04-05 01:50:00,26272,It's just as easy when it's under warrantee...  $4 pump from Princess Auto.. $16 quart of High Performance Merc lower unit oil. One $12 oil filter.. and not sure but probably a gallon of Merc outboard oil. Not sure what the EFI takes. Somewhere between $25 and $50  Of course this should have all been done BEFORE winter!
569193,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-05 01:58:00,2050,"$153.00 is what they're charging at Hully Gully in London just for the sake of a price range... I believe they said that includes all the oils, filters and new spark plugs... I thought changing the plugs seemed kinda weird if they're already in working order...."
569198,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-05 02:02:00,4399,"If we are talking fluids,filters and plugs do it yourself trust me if I could do basic service then anybody can!"
569206,Dara,2011-04-05 02:18:00,3052,Plugs? Maybe at 10 years old
569252,Fisherman,2011-04-05 20:36:00,7201, I wouldn't take my worst enemies toys to Hully Gully after some of the horror stories I've heard about that place.
569291,danbouck,2011-04-05 22:04:00,4380, Merc manual says to replace the first set after the first year.  I would budget $200-$250 for the first service
569293,GBW,2011-04-05 22:08:00,8460,I'm so happy I have a nice Jhonson...  google is your friend for how to do things if you have the tools and skills to do so.
569297,Whitespinnerbait,2011-04-05 22:15:00,2038, Nothing but a CASH GRAB
569478,fish_fishburn,2011-04-06 10:01:00,1311,Theres an oil filter on a EFI? Where would that be?
569480,danbouck,2011-04-06 10:30:00,4380," Under the cowl, can't miss it."
569529,irishfield,2011-04-06 13:30:00,26272, I'm presuming so on a 4 stroke 75HP
569567,Pikeslayer,2011-04-06 15:22:00,1443," A good mechanic is a certified mechanic. There are a lot of 'marine mechanics' in the GTA who are not current certified. Good certified mechanics (others are not) are busy this time of year so don't delay. Good certified mechanics are your friend. They charge the same hourly rate and warranty their work. Two springs ago, while phone shopping for tune up pricing everyone was within 10% and I chose the shop that could do the service right away. In total, it turned out to be A Big Fat $1000 Mistake A couple of weeks later, I ended up at my current mechanics shop and have been there ever since and will keep my future business there. I have sent you a PM with a referral for the good guy and a warning for the other.  Regards, Slayer"
569569,torco,2011-04-06 15:31:00,656,"My brother in-law is a marine mechanic and works at City Marine on the queensway in toronto. You could give that shop a call, I know they are mercury dealer.  Sorry I don't have a clue on what they charge though."
569636,Spiel,2011-04-06 19:44:00,9065," I have the same motor and I can assure you there is definitely and oil filter. As previously mentioned, it is a 4 stroke."
569655,Big Cliff,2011-04-06 20:31:00,6899,"Do you buy car insurance, life insurance, house insurance? Buy piece of mind insurance!  A good, certified marine mechanic will do a whole lot more than just change the oil, filter, and plugs. He will run the engine up, he has the scanner to tell him what the engine is and has been doing, he will tweek it if required and be able to spot any potential problems before you get left stranded. I am a licensed small engine mechanic and I take my merc to a dealer for service. Save a few bucks now?? What did that motor cost you? What will it cost you if you have to get towed off the lake. I like Buckhorn Marine in Bobcayegon, they have always been fair with me and I like the quality of work that they do. They will give you an estimate.  Oh and before some smart ass claims I'm just trying to promote the trade, I pay full shop rate when I take it in and I do know where the oil filter is and then some!"
569669,Black_Blade,2011-04-06 20:52:00,258,"If your handy with tools and its not under warranty anymore, you might be interested in The Marine Doctor.  He has gave me great advice in the past.  If not handy though...I agree with others posters and take it to a certified mechanic for sure!"
569680,Tybo,2011-04-06 21:06:00,1373,"I do my own, then take it in to be scanned."
569698,irishfield,2011-04-06 21:35:00,26272,"What are you getting scanned Paul?? What's it tell you? I know how many hours are on my motor...it runs fine.. what's the scan tell you?  I know more about my Verado than the last two ""certifed"" Verado techs at the Marina. I had to show the first Verado Certified fella that there IS actually a drain plug for the engine oil.... but I did so after he attemped to suck the reservior dry with a suction gun."
569711,Black_Blade,2011-04-06 21:52:00,258,Sounds like something you would experience if Canadian Tire opened up a marine service bay...
