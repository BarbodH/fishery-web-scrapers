569234,LucG,2011-04-05 20:09:00,779,Made it out on the ice one last time for some splake. I think it has been almost three times i've said that...lol  There was still lots of ice and plenty of snow in the bush. We could'nt have had better weather. I was even in a t-shirt for a while. Though I'd share a few pics. Check out this splakes stomach contents.
