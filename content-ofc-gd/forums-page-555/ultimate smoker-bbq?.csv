The hardcore fisherman and hunter has invented his ultimate outdoor cooker — the Hook and Cook.  The towable barbecue comes with skies or tires and can be hooked to a snowmobile or ATV.  ""The original one was made about 10 years ago . . . it was basic with just skis,"" says Michaud, 52.  But it was feedback of those who have seen the concept that pushed him to look at it in a different light.  ""My son (Ryan) said 'why don't we patent it because everyone who has seen it really liked it?'"" he Michaud recalls  A welder by trade, Michaud has always tinkered with metal, fabricating and developing new ideas.  After having used his first model for about a decade, he decided to improve it before applying for a patent.  The Hook and Cook's grill moves up, down and rotates easily, and the lid doubles as a table.  Michaud enjoys cooking on an open fire so much, he uses his year round.  The new model can be equipped with skis or tires, and comes apart for storage.  Michaud is also working on a storage container accessory that would allow for transportation of goods including fishing tackle and food.  ""That way there people can bring gear, the stove and they're ready to go,"" he says.  With only two Hook and Cooks in existence — the original and the newest model — Michaud hopes to find a company interested in manufacturing and marketing the idea.  ""I am looking for a company to work with me to get this on the market,"" he says, ""like a business partner.""  He believes there is a market out there, he just needs to get his cookers built.  ""If something comes of it, great. If not, I told me wife we will have one heck of a nice barbecue,"" he laughs.  Michaud can be reached at [email protected] or 705-776-1012.
