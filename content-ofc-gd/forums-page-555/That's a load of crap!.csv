569148,mike rousseau,2011-04-05 00:45:00,4661,Not yet but after this nice weather they should start soon...

569161,ehg,2011-04-05 01:09:00,2666,I would be under the impression most places that are worthwhile are still frozen as well.

569190,Michael_Brown,2011-04-05 01:55:00,411,I've been catching them in open water for two weeks now. You just need to know where to look but that is always the case.  Good Luck.
