515050,darsky,2010-10-26 22:02:00,586,that turn around did not take long.
515051,skeeter,2010-10-26 22:08:00,1907,so they have the first tee off time again this year??
515052,solopaddler,2010-10-26 22:12:00,8605,"Guess you better start planning the parade route eh?  twit for tat.  It's a long season, enjoy the turnaround while it lasts."
515053,Gregoire,2010-10-26 22:23:00,1397, Wouldn't the first tee off time be reserved for teams that did not make the playoffs?
515070,PikeMolester,2010-10-26 23:15:00,428,lol leafs fans were making floats when they were 2-0. They don't know  what winning is...so unfamiliar with it. And Skeeter that makes no sense because we went to the conference finals not to play golf before playoffs like the Leafs.
515079,daryl0815,2010-10-26 23:53:00,225,"haha nobody should care who is in first place after 8 or 9 games. I mean does anyone think Nashville is going to finish #1 (where they sit now)?  I know that T.O and Montreal fans are both guilty of it, and its easy to get excited with all of the media attention that hockey gets up here, but after the all star break then lets talk results, and even then its only half way there.  I love hockey, but I try not to get too wrapped up in standings until they really mean something nearer the end of the season."
515105,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-27 01:33:00,0,"Ummmm, the leafs!!!"
515118,skeeter,2010-10-27 01:53:00,1907," You are right,, it doesnt make sense. stop living in the past, this thread is about now not last year. BTW: the LEAFS won tonight!!!!! when this season is over i will be there to lead the parade for Montreal.    "
515228,ehg,2010-10-27 17:05:00,2666,Didn't the Canadiens knock Washington and Pittsburgh out of the playoffs last year. This year they look like a better team. Just sayin

515237,jjcanoe,2010-10-27 17:45:00,744,"seems that they are TIED with The Leafs for first in the NE division..... well lets see, what's the first tiebreaker.... Oh it's head to head meetings..... HMMMM have they played each other this year?? I believe they did.... and who won that game??? I've got such a short memory... Oh it was The Leafs.... That means Montreal is SECOND place....."
515245,Kinger,2010-10-27 18:12:00,351,"Goals for determines who is ahead when two division rivals have the same record,i think."
515251,Mike Pike,2010-10-27 18:28:00,1332,"Here, in order, is the tied-breaker criteria.  Although it's probably a little more relavent after 82 games.  lol  1) Wins: Most total wins among the tied teams. 2) Head-to-Head Record: Most points in games against each other among the tied teams. 3) Goal Differential: Using the total goals scored during the regular season, the greater positive differential between goals for and against among the tied teams."
515305,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-27 21:45:00,0,montreal is in first?  wow!  screw planning the parade solo!  let them plan their riot!
515312,muskymatt,2010-10-27 21:54:00,2608,The only thing Montreal fans should be happy about at this time is that they are not leaf fans!!  Go Sens Go

569589,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-06 16:23:00,4399,Props to the Leafs they were one of the best teams in the league after they discover Reimer!!!  I would have loved to see them give Philly a run for their money in the first round!!!  Maybe next year.
569837,Chance,2011-04-07 02:39:00,420,I am hoping philly gets their act together soon to make a go of it.They look awful lately...Pronger anyone??
