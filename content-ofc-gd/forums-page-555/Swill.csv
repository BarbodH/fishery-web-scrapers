The Strait Line Anglers Club will be having its next monthly meeting on Tues April 5 at 7pm @ the Grimsby Legion. As allways, all are welcome to attend. While we are a multi-species club, the focus that evening will be on Spring Salmon as we are happy to have guest speaker Karl Chmilnitzky (captain of Team Twofish & the 2010 Scotty King Of The Lake series)on hand to share some tips, stories and also have a little Q&A  We will be in the basement but the bar will be open upstairs. We plan to start promptly at 7pm.  directions & more info www.straitlineanglers.com or look up our facebook page  hope to see some of you there"
