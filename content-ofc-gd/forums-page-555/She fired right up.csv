569644,lew,2011-04-06 20:11:00,12766,"It was such a gorgeous day today that I decided to finally bring the boat outta the garage and putz around with it. I hooked up the water pressure gauge 1st then it was time to start the engine for the 1st time this year. I hooked up the motor muffs, primed the bulb a couple times and hit the key. Before the motor even made a complete revolution the 150 horses kicked in & the big girl was purring like a kitten.  Gotta luv those Yamaha 4 strokes  I spent an hour just puttering around with it then gave it a good wash stem to stern to get rid of the winter dust and now she's all set to go once the water softens up a bit.  Can't wait for the 1st run up the lake !!"
569653,danbouck,2011-04-06 20:30:00,4380,Mine did the same thing on Sunday
569654,irishfield,2011-04-06 20:31:00,26272,Great stuff Lew... I rotated and charged all my batteries today and gave all my trailer wheels a good spin and side play rock yesterday. I'm ready to roll when and if the time permits.
569656,Big Cliff,2011-04-06 20:33:00,6899," Did you use fuel stabilizer in your gas?  BTW, the only down side to using muffs is that you are applying water under pressure and it won't show you if the impeller is in good shape or not. Just make sure that when you put the motor in the lake it does pee properly before you head away from the launch."
569662,Tybo,2011-04-06 20:40:00,1373,"Holy crow!I thought, I would never see the day that Lew had his boat started. Even before mine is on the ground."
569666,lew,2011-04-06 20:50:00,12766, You just need to start gettin up earlier Paul
569672,lew,2011-04-06 20:55:00,12766, I run stabilizer all the time in all my gear Cliff.
569674,bubbles,2011-04-06 20:59:00,591,"Have been putzing with mine for a week, tomorrow we hit the water for some big fat female eyes! (If they co operate with my plan, hopefully they got the memo)"
569681,bigbuck,2011-04-06 21:07:00,2449,"I'll be picking mine up some time at the beginning of May depending on when my Tach gets shipped up from the States from Faria (Lifetime warranty on their guages so if you have Faria guages and one dies, you can send it back to them to be rebuilt for a nominal charge - 40 bux US is what I paid for a multifunction guage). With any luck, the weather in May will be decent and we can get out for a couple of pleasure/spring shakedown cruises and maybe some fishing."
569684,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-06 21:11:00,4399,Yes when I had my Yammy 4 it always started first crank in the spring and I am hoping the Opti will do the same this spring!
