569091,irishfield,2011-04-04 23:16:00,26272,"Got a letter today... Service Bulletin 2011-03 / OEM Service Bulletin 2011-02  Replacement of the shift bell crank. Your authorized Mercury dealer will replace the shift bell crank and the stud of the upper shift shaft without charge.  Reason: Potential for corrosion cracking at the base of the shift control studs of both the shift bellcrank and the upper shift shaft.  There are no specifics as to what years this covers, so I'm assuming all of them. My motor is a 2007 - mfg Dec 2006.  Great to see Merc sending these out ""in the interest of your continued satisfaction with our product"". Mine's now out of warranty so they probably don't have to even notify me.  So any of you running a Verado.... watch the mail for your letter, as even though it has no serial number/model number or even my name on it... I'm supposed to present it to my dealer for service. So if you need a copy...."
