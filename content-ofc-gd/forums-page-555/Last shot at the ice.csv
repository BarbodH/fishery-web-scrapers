Made the push on Sunday to get on the ice before it's gone....hit up Vernon for a few hours and got nada....except my pal who had this ugly thing swim out of his hole:    Could mark fish on the screen, but couldn't get them to move....so by noon I was packed up and headed to Rosseau...on my own by now as my pal had to leave.  Couldn't QUITE get to my spot....but landed within a few feet of it....separated by an old pressure crack that was uncrossable.  Settled for 45FOW and after a couple of hours and a few different lures,  figured out how to make them chase a LimeyAngler special...got 2 small ones....but they put a huge grin on my face! Now the ice gear is put away and I don't mind      See you on the softwater!!"

569533,highdrifter,2011-04-06 13:38:00,2534,Atta boy Johnny!  Tomorrow's our last ice trip too.  And that's a giant water scorpion.  A true bug of the hemiptera family.  Nasty looking bugger!!
