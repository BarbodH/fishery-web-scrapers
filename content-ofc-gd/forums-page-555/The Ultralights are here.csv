568668,Leecher,2011-04-03 12:47:00,7832,Excellent work Mike Those toothy critters don't stand a chance!!!
568670,Roy,2011-04-03 12:57:00,13728,"Very nice, Mike. That Angel Wings is especially appealing."
568675,GBW,2011-04-03 13:46:00,8460,"NICE, Canada Day rocks!"
568676,outllaw,2011-04-03 13:51:00,1232,nice stuff mike. i bet building lures makes life a little more complicated eh lol.
568698,Handlebarz,2011-04-03 16:27:00,3790,Thanks everyone I hope to have a chance to get out and use some thins year myself for early season pike.  Roy I thought about calling it frosty but after the picture it gave the color a new name.  George its still fun so I can deal with the complicated stuff maybe not in two weeks LOL.  I am just leaving the house to deliver the first batch of Ultralites.
568764,camillj,2011-04-03 21:28:00,1988,"Yep, I'm with Roy on that one .. Angel's wing for sure .. specially for ice-out specks !"
568904,Handlebarz,2011-04-04 10:41:00,3790,Never thought about bigger spinners for them we always used very small ones for the rivers. I guess if your fishing a lake they might do the trick.  I did also learn today that some guys will use musky sized lures for walleye here on lake Erie looking for them big buggers.
569274,esoxansteel,2011-04-05 21:26:00,1307,"  delivering the first batch of ultra lites eh, if im not home ill leave the door open you should make it in about 5 hours, cold beer peporettes and jerky are in the fridge, dont touch the walleye or bluegill fillets   they look great MP"
569452,Handlebarz,2011-04-06 03:52:00,3790,I must say the fish fillets are going to be safe as I still have not figured out why people would want to eat fish in the first place.  You had me for the delivery until I read Beer if the offer was for some nice crown I would have been there by now
569453,irishfield,2011-04-06 03:55:00,26272,I have a bottle or three of Crown in the cupboard Mike....
569483,Handlebarz,2011-04-06 10:34:00,3790,Dang Wayne I say screw Canada Post I think a road trip is in need   I would so love to head up your way for a visit and one of these days I hope the wife kids and myself get to move up north a bit so we can get to more OFC events.
