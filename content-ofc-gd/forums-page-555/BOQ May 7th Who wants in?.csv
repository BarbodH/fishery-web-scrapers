554541,e-z-out,2011-02-23 03:09:00,1052,Well guys just got off the phone with Lloyd and on May 7th I'll be heading to BOQ for a boat ride if we catch any fish that's a bonus.  Looking for 3 others to split the cost with me.   Remember fish are a bonus but when you fish with Lloyd you know the fishing is going to be good. Good times and good friends make a fun day Thanks again Lloyd for the great offer for myself and 3 other OFC members
554685,fishhunter,2011-02-23 16:04:00,604,"After talking to you last night, I thought I would add another hour to your charter making it 10 hours for you and your group. Look forward to seeing you and your group in May"
554960,e-z-out,2011-02-24 02:40:00,1052,Now there is a killer deal for anyone that hasn't fished with Lloyd as of yet.
554962,irishfield,2011-02-24 02:43:00,26272,He's just adding an extra hour so he has time to prepare your fish!! lol
