569369,danbouck,2011-04-06 00:42:00,4380,I am going to by this for the new GPS but it doesn't list Erie as being on the Canada one only Eastern US. Does anybody know if Long Point Bay or parts of Erie are on it?
569371,SlowPoke,2011-04-06 00:46:00,2984,Erie should be on the Lowrance base map (built in). I know it is on my 525 and 522. I'll check my hotmaps Canada... will reply shortly.

It on the Great lakes map"
