How is simcoe's ice , wish i could get ouot to check myself but the family conditions are preventing me from doing anything right now. Spwans are going to be late by 2-3 weeks I think unless it drastically warms which is not in the forecast it looks like its going to be a cold slow openor. Last year I had already been out a few times for Lake O browns. I havnt even taken the cover off yet....grrrrrrr"
569367,Terry,2011-04-06 00:39:00,14456,"well on a clear day you get a good satellite photo of the lakes here http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/modis.cgi/modis?region=h&page=1  which will give you a good idea of how the lakes are doing  but, Georgian bay should be great for May 1"
569380,Rizzo,2011-04-06 01:10:00,4754,kempenfelt bay still ice covered but doesn't look too safe (starting to get dark). I would guess a couple good days of 5-10 degree weather and the ice will be gone
569414,irishfield,2011-04-06 02:05:00,26272,You can follow me out Darren !!! That'll be the week before Jen's #9 and I plan on being on the water that week. Gonna give the planner mast a whirl this time...  BTW.. Midland Harbour is now pretty much ice free after the ice breaker came in to get the grain boat out on the 29th. Heavy rain the other night took care of most of the rest..
569428,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-06 02:35:00,0,  I have a better idea.    The ice will be out over the next two weeks and will be prime for getting some Big Fish. Last of the weekend openers for the next 5 years.  YEAHHHH....lol.....
