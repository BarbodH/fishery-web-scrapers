569020,zman,2011-04-04 20:49:00,179,Well I wanted to get out and try the new boat I was woundering what drifting the Niagara for some steelhead this time of year would be like
569033,canadadude,2011-04-04 21:36:00,769,"Good to fantastic, the ice boom hasn't let go yet, lots of hold over browns a steelies area around . If your new the boat ramp at queenston is fine fish the back drift out front, there will be some fish there, if you want to travel up to the power dams, ask a the dudes out there or follow they'll show you the way. It's a crazy ride somtimes the first few times you do it, but the fish'in and sweet drifts is worth it."
569043,craigdritchie,2011-04-04 21:45:00,1586,Uh huh. Should be stellar for a few weeks.
569053,canadadude,2011-04-04 22:05:00,769,"Hey z-man even fish'in some down river drifts may pay out, lots of bows in the river now, water is good , clear wind isn't effecting to much, now is killer time"
569075,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-04 22:48:00,10439, Definately!!! The drift by the old launch ramp just down stream can be pretty good.
