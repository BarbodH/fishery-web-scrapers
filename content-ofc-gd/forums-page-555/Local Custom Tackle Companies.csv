With that said, I was wondering if anyone knew of any local manufacturers. I figured, why not give the local guys a shot. It might give you something that not every fish has seen already.  Websites with pictures would be great .  Thanks!"

I am just finishing up a order right now of the Ultralites they are lighter version of my double 8's I am making them with lighter wire and smaller hooks that are extra sharp. There is a thread here with some of them or check the site I added them over the weekend. I will be getting the other colors up soon.
