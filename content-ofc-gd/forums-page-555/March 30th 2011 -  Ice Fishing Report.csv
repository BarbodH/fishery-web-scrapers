568308,Leecher,2011-04-01 22:16:00,7832,"I know I had said in my last report that it was my last time out   but on Sunday, me and Paul talked about going back and just could not resist    Decided that Wednesday was the day  Temp wise, it was looking great and a good reason to get out of the office    The plan was to leave around noon and fish til sunset  Wednesday came around, got our gear ready and left around 12:30pm, picked up CPrince on our way up and the way we go..... Got to destination around 2:30pm, temperature was +6C sunny and very mild winds from the East  Drove right on the lake..... lots of people fishing, our first targeted spot was busy so we decided to drive across to the honey hole and get setup    good call, Paul got a whitie when we just got there then an OOS laker  CPrince aka Craig got a couple of hits but could not land them  He also got a new specie and personal best (wooden lingker)    I got a strike and that was it on a buck shot..... Oh and a snag that had my heart stop for a split second     Tried Mr Champ, buckshot and Swedish pimple.  No pics this time, just raw video footage of the action we got.   It sure was nice to be out fishing in the lovely weather and amongst friends  Departure was just before the sun had set over the mountains... bite had turned off    Saw a couple of deers on the road on the way back, took a couple of pics but they were too far into the bush and cannot see them   zoom on the camera not powerful enough  That was around 7:30pm and got home at 9:30pm.... Thank you Paul and Craig for an awesome time  Here's the video compilation I made.... Enjoy!!!

568875,Joey,2011-04-04 02:58:00,9122,Really great vid
568903,Handlebarz,2011-04-04 10:37:00,3790,The vid is not working here but I can imagine it was nice just from the report. I sure do miss them spring ice fishing days heck we had our ice gone so long I dont remember when it left.
569115,Leecher,2011-04-04 23:49:00,7832, Thanks Carole!!!  Glad you liked it   Thanks Joey!!!   Thanks Mike!!!  Those are the days I truly enjoy and makes for a very long day.... cause I just don't want to leave until we just have to
569127,limeyangler,2011-04-05 00:08:00,5204,"AWESOME!!!!!  Always enjoy your reports Jacques...but had to admit when you'd make the leap to 'live' footage.  Great report, and silky editing/production skills (did i just use the word 'silky?...lol)"
569134,Leecher,2011-04-05 00:17:00,7832, Thanks Simon!!!  LOL yeah raw silky footage is the best for video editing but only available when the fish don't bite my lures
