I've got a friend that's got a machine shop so getting it done wouldn't be a problem. I guess I'm wondering if they cause problems down the road, like break right off while your towing your boat or something like that."
214958,icefisherman,2008-06-13 02:31:00,952,"I've done it last Nov. on the trailer/boat I just bought back then. It was the only way to get it in my garage. Even then I had to remove my staircase to the house... Used Fulton kit, works like a charm, never had a problem with it. Did it for about an hour on the driveway. Easy!  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
214967,forrest,2008-06-13 03:12:00,1032, What did you use to cut down the existing tongue? Regular hand hacksaw?  forrest
214969,Sinker,2008-06-13 03:15:00,8692,A sawzall would cut that like butter......even a skill saw with a good blade would cut thru that with ease....just taker slow.  Sinker
215105,icefisherman,2008-06-13 13:45:00,952,"I've used my Reciprocating Saw. It got done for no time at all.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
215114,Wendel,2008-06-13 14:04:00,213,"ah, I've got a Sawzall, maybe I can do it right in my driveway, thought it had to be welded to."
215134,icefisherman,2008-06-13 14:36:00,952," No welding anywhere. Just drilling and bolts tightening. Assuming you have the kit it'll come with the extra support pieces to mount on the inside of the tube. It also comes with template for drilling the holes.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
215222,perodimi,2008-06-13 18:15:00,124,I put one of these on my Shorelander trailer for my Legend boat and so far it works well:  Fulton Swing Hitch Kit    They're in Milton and it cost around $100.00 or so including delivery. I used a sawsall and the bolts provided.  Peter  P.S: Don't forget to remove the wires before you cut!
215258,Zamboni,2008-06-13 19:38:00,235,"If your trailer has the coupler attached to a smaller square tube that slides into a larger tube there's a 'poor man's' conversion if you just need a foot or so off trailer length. Drill 2 holes where the 2 tubes overlap, the smaller one will be at least 4"" into the larger tube....you will put bolts (at least 1/2"" grade 5) in those holes. Now grind off the weld holding the 2 tubes together, the peice with coupler will slide out. Clean up the weld, make sure there's nothing you will cut yourself on and its done.  My buddy used pins instead of bolts to be easily removable but it rattled around too much."
