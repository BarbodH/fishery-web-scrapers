There was no match  ....we hammered them and gained another victory for the trout hunters  Every Laker that was landed today, weighed over 5lbs!!...the bite was constant...at one point we had a double header', but they both got off as well as a few others that were missed...  Here's some pics to share...            "
214788,Raf,2008-06-12 22:14:00,3495,"nice job!  good looking fish.  i see riggers, all deep?"
214789,Musky or Specks,2008-06-12 22:14:00,2710,"Those are some very nice lakers where were you finding them. Deep , middle of the water column or up top."
214790,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-12 22:19:00,1362,I caught the first 2 on lead core....my buddy followed and quit using the rigger....10 colors out ~ 50' + another additional  some with the bait we were using...water temp was a surprising 68F...we marked lots between 50' and 120'....thermacline was at the 50' mark which explains the action we got
