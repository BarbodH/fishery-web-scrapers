214242,BillM,2008-06-11 18:35:00,17367,"I think you'll really need to key in on new weed growth.  I just got back from 3 days on the French (Main Channel, Dry Pine Bay, etc) without even a follow.  The high water levels and weather has really stunted the weed growth this year.  Hopefully, by the time you get out there things are a little more inline with what they should be."
214246,Reef Runner,2008-06-11 18:40:00,981,"Another french musky hunter.  Well an OFNer went this past weekend, without much success.  It is a hard place to fish and hard to find them.  Look for weed growth adjacent to deeper water.  I think a Km or so South of the Dokis reservation there are a couple of cabins (Brian's place, don't remeber the lodge but the owner was unforgettable, great guy btw) with a dock wrapping around the lakefront.  That little bay in there has plenty of weed growth and we got a HUGE ski follow but no takey.  Good luck,  reefrunner  P.S.  beat me to it BillM, lol"
214253,addy79,2008-06-11 19:14:00,573,It was Casa Blanca Lodge and Bryan is AWESOME...  we need to go back Reefrunner!
214260,Reef Runner,2008-06-11 19:26:00,981,"CASA BLANCA.  No doubt, Brian is a class act, in a class of one. lol.  I would go back in a heartbeat."
214336,Daplumma,2008-06-11 23:02:00,1961,"I can third that was casa blanca.Great place to stay,he can clue you in on some spots for Muskie. Joe"
214359,steve_paul,2008-06-12 00:32:00,658,Saw that he is selling off all the cabins at Casa Blanca.  I am assuming he is keeping the main lodge but the cabins are up for sale for $80K each.
214396,Daplumma,2008-06-12 01:29:00,1961,Last I saw he was trying to sell off the whole place.Dont know how well the cabin sale will go. Joe

214542,Reef Runner,2008-06-12 13:13:00,981,"Yup, when we went last year he tried selling us the cabin we were staying in.  lol.  In the lodge itself, he's got some massive stuffed ski's, awsome place for sure."
214544,BillM,2008-06-12 13:17:00,17367,"  You just wait, I will curse your boat soon enough!!!!!!!!!!!!   :)"
215092,DonC,2008-06-13 13:06:00,36,"Enjoyed good times at Casa Blanca the past 2 years with Bryan.   We did the American Plan.  Food was very good.  Fishing for smallmouth is great.  Caught smallmouth up to 20 inches.  A lot of fun fishing below Chaudiere Dam for smallmouths.   Caught some 15 inch white bass for the first time which surprised us.  Never knew they were in the system.  Hooked a 40+inch muskie there too but could not hold it more than 2 minutes in the current from shore.  Fish the docks behind Sandy Island at the mouth of the French for smallmouth.  Sad to see the lodge owners struggling with business.  The gas prices, exchange rate and creel limits are doing a job on them over all Canada.  Personally I agree with improving the fishery with slot and creel limits.  Have a great time, Don"
