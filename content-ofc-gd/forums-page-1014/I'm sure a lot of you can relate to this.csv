206146,limeyangler,2008-05-25 22:23:00,5204,"Just been browsing the topics here for a while, and cant help getting excited about the next time i can get out fishing. I found myself chuckling insanely at myself for getting so excited. I never, ever ,ever tire of fishing!! No matter how , where or for how long the expedition is, as soon as i know i'm going the buzz is there.  My wife laughs at me and says i'm like a 5 year old on xmas eve the night before i know i'm going on a days mission. She's not wrong either, i litterally cant sleep for excitement at the prospect and promise of an awesome day. Many a time even though i have been up till 1 or 2 am getting my gear perfectly organised, thinking i must get some sleep cuz we're leaving at 5am, I lie in bed and wake up every 20 mins or so to see if its time to go yet!  I just thought i'd write it down as it was on my mind, maybe some of you can relate, maybe not, i suspect a lot of you will though. Tight llines all   PS...although new to this site...love it already!"
206152,Sinker,2008-05-25 22:40:00,8692,I think they call it addicted.  I also suffer the same sickness. You'll get used to it....don't worry  Sinker

206154,Gerritt,2008-05-25 22:43:00,6129,I do get excited to go out.... especially on a big trip.. to the point where I almost vomit.. LOL... call it nerves.  G
206157,HTHM,2008-05-25 22:47:00,4082,"And that is a bad thing, why? I think we all have that to some degree."
206173,fish_finder,2008-05-25 23:12:00,370,    More than one case here!!
206175,ccmtcanada,2008-05-25 23:17:00,7971,"Yep...can relate to it for sure!  Especially if it's a new lake, or to target a new species!  You are not alone...that's for sure!"
206182,jwl,2008-05-25 23:27:00,1056,"I spend between 150-200 days out there fishing for something every year,sometimes more over the years,and yep get excited every time, as a matter of fact I been sittin here all day with ants in my pants waiting for my wife to call that she is done work so I can head up to my trailer for a couple days of fishing...and heck this my 11th season camping/fishing there"
206249,limeyangler,2008-05-26 01:18:00,5204,"ahhhhh...i knew i was not alone....and yeas i'm addicted, obsessed...call it what ya like lol...but i dont wanna be cured"
206404,cranks bait,2008-05-26 12:45:00,721,Add another to the list.  Especcially when I get to go to the cottage.  I have those feelings all the time even though I get to fish an average of 4 times a week.
206410,bigcreekdad,2008-05-26 12:53:00,546,I go thru the same thing at least twice a year......45+ years now
206440,bullybass,2008-05-26 13:59:00,144,I think that I may have it the worst... every time that My Bro=in-law and I decide to go out I can't sleep and am excited beyond belief... the trouble is that 40% of the time my Bro-in-law flakes out and decides not to go....   problem is he is the one with all the toys... man I need a boat!!!!
206718,Hookset,2008-05-26 23:32:00,367,"Yep...can't sleep the night before either until about a half hour before it's time to get up then I pass out  That's usually just on the special days like opening weekends, tourneys and such now days though. So on those days I stay on the couch with the alarm clock set. Fully dressed. Coffee pot programmed. All gear loaded. Alarm goes off, stand up, pour coffee, and walk out the door...perfect.   Hookset."
206771,Sinker,2008-05-27 01:04:00,8692, Hahaha......I see we have the same system going

214744,Gerritt,2008-06-12 21:03:00,6129,Knowing I am leaving Saturday for one week of fishing bliss... is killing me! Saturday cannot come soon enough.. I already have the jitters.. tomorrow I will be a bloody wreck!  G
