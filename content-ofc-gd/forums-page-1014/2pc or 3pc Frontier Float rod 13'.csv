214450,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-12 03:41:00,0,For the same Frontier 13' float rod .. would you prefer 2pc or 3pc?  3pc seems to be heavier ... not sure if I am being crazy or ..  Thanks!
214472,linweir,2008-06-12 04:56:00,202,Definitely 2 pc. I have one custom made. Frontier is light but has alot of backbone. I think most of 13 ft rods are 2 pc.
214483,canadian_copper,2008-06-12 10:51:00,925,2 PIECE IS BETTER (1 LESS STRESS POINT) BUT 3 IS MUCH EASIER FOR PEOPLE WITH SMALLER CARS!!!
214541,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-12 13:13:00,0,"Size-wise, i know 3pc is alot easier to carry around.  what about weight-wise?  what about in terms of the stiffness? it seems the 3pc is stiffer since it has more reinforced sections  what do you think?"
214600,jdmls,2008-06-12 16:55:00,575,"exactly what CC said...plus 2 piece is less to align when puting the rod together, although 3pc is easier to get to the tip to take ice off the guides when you only have to take off a 3 ft section...mainly preference"
214609,MJL,2008-06-12 17:05:00,2427,"I've used my dad's 3 piece Frontier and like the action.  I believe John Collina (of JC tackle) mentioned on another web-site that the 2pc was designed with more backbone than the 3pc.  On most mid to high end rods sold today, I personally can't feel the difference between 2, 3 and 4 pc rods. I favour multi-piece rods because of all the traveling I do on the bus/subway and small car.  IMO, ferrule technology has advanced to the point where I can pick up an entry level 4pc Sage fly rod, a 3pc Lamiglas float rod or a 3pc St. Croix travel spinning rod and not notice flat spots when I flex it or load it up during the cast.   The only people I can imagine who might feel the difference are professional rod designers and tournament distance casters like Mark Hutchinson, Terry Edmonds, Steve Rajeff and Jerry Siem whom cast or fish their rods every single day 365 days a year.  From my experiences, the 13' 3pc Frontier is a nice smooth rod.  The only downside to a 3pc rod is it doesn't break down easily when it's rigged up.  The guides on the 2pc and 3pc frontiers are also different.  From my understanding the 3pc uses PacBay SIC's while the 2pc uses Aluminum oxide.   If you use braid (which some people run on their pin or spinning reels), aluminum oxide does groove over time.  Hope this helps"
214666,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-12 18:51:00,0,What I also noticed is the price difference  3pc is $60 more expensive than 2pc is ... wonder why .. i guess the guide difference is the reason ...
214676,Canuck2fan,2008-06-12 19:11:00,1444, I don't know what is better and can't add anything to what has already been mentioned. However if you are looking at 13ft rods do yourself a favour and look at a Streamside for about 100 bucks it will blow you away. Very similar in quality and features to rods costing up 4X as much.... They only come in 2pc but might just change you mind about what you need to spend. Josh in Woostock has them and highly recommends them when he could sell you a much more expensive rod.
214682,highdrifter,2008-06-12 19:16:00,2534, More components.  Frontier uses the same high end guides on all there noodlers I believe..  Get the 13' in a 2 piece if you can manage.  You'll be glad you did!  HD
214993,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-06-13 06:09:00,0,Went to buy the 3pc 13' Frontier today and compared with my 13' Sheffield Select side-by-side ...  could not notice any weight difference .. or the weight distribution ..  in terms of action ... Frontier is alot more softer than Sheffield ..  started wondering if it is just the name I spent the money on or i am just not good enough to appreciate its true value
