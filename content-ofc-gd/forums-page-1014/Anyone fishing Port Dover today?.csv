215152,shane,2008-06-13 15:01:00,652,It's Friday the 13th!  We went down once a couple years ago just to see what all the fuss was about.............What a freak show!
215155,Raf,2008-06-13 15:11:00,3495,Yep.. may be down there setting up a stage this eve.. then I'm outta dodge!
215184,Rich,2008-06-13 16:53:00,3927,"I was there last night, just slaying the perch .. then the boats showed up. Never did understand why people that live in town have to bring their boats to the pier rather than just walk or drive in (they have residence passes anyway). Anywho, cut our perchin' short. Report to come though. It was already a nut house on Tuesday night, last night unbearable. Won't catch me in town on the 13th. Been through that enough when I lived there!"
215187,BFSC Kevin,2008-06-13 16:57:00,1351,  can you fill me in? some kind of event goes on or something on friday the 13th?
215191,Rich,2008-06-13 17:01:00,3927,"It's called ""biker's night"" where all the bikers from across Canada come to Port Dover and party 'er up. The Port Dover board of trade has actually franchised ""Friday 13th"" as booths coming to sell merchandise during the event have to sell 'official' sanctioned Friday 13th apparel. It costs 25 bucks a t-shirt at wholesale - do the math on how much profit they make. Bah-humbug. I hate Friday 13th. Why can't the bikers just go where everyone else goes - Toronto!"
215201,Canuck2fan,2008-06-13 17:37:00,1444,I can understand the locals not enjoying it very much. It was interesting though to hear on the radio that EVERY organized charity in Norfolk county makes more on this one day than they do canvassing for the whole rest of the year..... So more power to them I say but then I am not there fighting the crowds LOL.
215312,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-13 22:19:00,2585,i hear fishing for beer cans and cigerette butts this weekend is totally non stop action!  just kidding its a good time if you have never been but once was enough for me.  They do raise alot of money for charities so its a good event in my eyes.  just happy its not in my town lol  cheers!
215316,Clampet,2008-06-13 22:33:00,1947,They covered it on the 6:00 O'Clock News.
