214891,Marko,2008-06-13 00:59:00,854,"Was supposed to meet up with Bill and John yesterday for some fly fishing but work got in the way, typical. Sorry i couldnt join you yesterday, next time for sure, if work lets me lol. Decided to head out today myself, had to clear my head. Went to Elmira to my carp pond lol and what do you know they are swimming around, not minding me one bit. Got there around 4 ish, sun was up and a little windy. They would come up and stick their heads out look at me and go down, all day long. Last time i went there i caught about 30 bullheads in 2 hours on canned corn. Today i went to sobeys and end up buying corn on a cob, thinking i am gonna try it. I read some reports on here that carp prefer sweet corn over canned corn, decided to give it a try. Here are results for couple of hours i was there:   baby lol        I am guessing this is some kind of mirror carp, never caught one like this before  another closer shot of the same fish,  last fish of the day   There is no bigger thrill then watching fish take your bait as its sinking. Took my sinker off at one point and just casted single hook with some corn on it and let them hit it."

214982,wolfville,2008-06-13 04:15:00,396,"Wow, that's pretty good for a few hours.  Yes, that was a mirror. I also found the fish in the 2nd picture interesting. Did it have whiskers?"
215059,Victor,2008-06-13 11:55:00,1609," I agree ... possibly a crucian?  Great job, little ones still put up quite a scrap. Love the look of that mirror carp ... man i need to get myself one."
