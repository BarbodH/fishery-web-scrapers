Simple question, where would I be looking for the largest SM bass at that time of year? It has a shallow shoreline with lots of weeds and reeds and a deeper middle section."
215207,Reef Runner,2008-06-13 17:50:00,981,"I would head for structure closer to the deeper water, ie., rock piles, underwater reefs.  Bang around the depths with a white with silver flake tube jig."
215208,purekgw,2008-06-13 17:56:00,585,shoals are always good
215216,Stoty,2008-06-13 18:07:00,2910,"I agree with Reefrunner. Try to find some ""irregular"" spots in the deeper water.  Humps on bottom that might only rise/drop 3-4 feet, small rocky shoals, where 2 different bottoms mix...etc. Anything ""different"" in the deeper water should hold the biggest bass that time of the year."
215272,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-13 20:28:00,2585,"find deeper water that has structure.  often the big fish are in or very close to depe water.  close to rock piles, sunken logs, humps etc.....using a tube is the easiest way to find active fish.  If fish are finiky then try live bait like leeches.  Cheers!"
