Using blue/silver and Copper/silver flat lining out to about 40 FOW not marking many bait fish.trolling back and fourth across the plant.Water temps 48-49 deg. 2.0-2.4 mph. No luck and only marking 2-3 fish at 10 ft. Gave up and started into the plant flow water temps up to 62.0 deg. close in and down to 53.0 deg. outside. Many follows but nothing biting."
214581,Greencoachdog,2008-06-12 15:40:00,8163,.. and that's why they call it fishin' and not catchin'.  Better Luck next time!
214667,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-12 18:51:00,0,That sucks. I'm surprised you didn't even catch a sheep head. The area seems to be full of them. Lots of pike follows? You should have slowed down your retrieve or paused a few times!
214669,ccmtcanada,2008-06-12 18:59:00,7971,Thanks for the report.  It's not always about the catching....good luck the next time out and hopefully we'll see some fish pics!!
214680,Pachone,2008-06-12 19:15:00,276,Ptown eh......... ill b down @ the waterfront casting from shore on sunday...only if Darymple doesnt work out.
214759,mike hagan,2008-06-12 21:32:00,50,"Did stop the retrieve jerked tried every possible tactic,except net them when they where at the boat, Had two pike follow right to the boat stopped 2 times in and the pike stop right behind the lure started realling and it followed brought every fish within nets reach and all they did was follow right to the boat and then calmly swam away.Had one smallie just look at my suspended lure for over a minute ,just left it there and the dumb/no smart fish just stayed right behind it . Without exaterizing must of been over 30 follows right to the boat , Salmon/Trout,smallies , Pike ,Carp, Damn Fish,LOL The lake was nice thought."
