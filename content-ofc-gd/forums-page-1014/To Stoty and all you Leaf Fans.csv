Datsyuk didn't come to North America until he was 23, and Zetterberg was 22 in his rookie season. Johan Franzen was a third-round choice in 2004, when he was 24."
214878,oncogene,2008-06-13 00:50:00,154,ok maybe i'm not a Leaf fans... but what do those have to do with the Leafs?

214882,Greencoachdog,2008-06-13 00:54:00,8163,Is it true that the little black thing they smack around on the ice with them curved willow branches is reallly a frozen Moose turd?
214889,danbouck,2008-06-13 00:58:00,4380, tis true!
214890,bucktail,2008-06-13 00:59:00,1857,lunkerbasshunter....exactly!!!!!

214909,Cookslav,2008-06-13 01:21:00,1457,"Leafs suck because they sell out even when they suck.... Managment is a joke.  They play for a playoff birth every year so they can fill a few more seats, when they should be dumping the whole lot, bite the bullet, and rebuild already....  You think pittsburg has been great the last 5 years stong?...no sir Do you They picked up early draft pick gems like Crosby, Malkin, Staal, Malone, Orpik, Fleury by having great seasons, and lengthy playoff runs?  Hell no! They had some bad seasons, saved their draft picks, invested in their scouting, develpoed young talent on the farm, and when the time was right they brough the right talent in via their draft picks to strengthen their emerging ""YOUNG"" and talented team. They picked up a few key Vets and went to work....  Look at Detroit with young up and commers like zettleburg, datsyuk, and Cleary... Cripes you need depth, and to get depth you need youth to develop.  Toronto's biggest issue is they are always looking for the hero...that one or two guys to be our salvation who always tend to be Vets? Sure Sundins great but he's only one man???  Simply put The Leafs biggest issue is the ""TORONTO FAN"" Not to be confused with a Leaf fans... You know...the guys and gals that will cheer for Toronto pro teams in every sport, no matter how bad they are. The same guys and gals who know nothing of the sport but will still buy the seats with their corporate credit cards, and go to the odd game even though they have seasons tickets... The same Guys and gals that think Sundin, and Tucker are the greatest hockey players in the game but if you asked them they couldn't name another player on the team.  The true leaf fans know we suck, and know their needs to be a big change before we can get better. Petty has got to go first....we need a true hocket owner as well, not a union retirement group.  thats my 2 cents... I feel much better now"
