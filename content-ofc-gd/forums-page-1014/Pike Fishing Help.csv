198973,huntervasili,2008-05-09 02:25:00,1604,Some very good and informative info on there FHR!
198995,danc,2008-05-09 03:08:00,4677,"Northern Ontario version. Tie whatever on to your line. Cast. Retrieve. Pike on.  Equipment?? Whatever you happen to be using.  Extra info. Try to shake the said creature off of your hook before you have to land it. You don't want to  bring it into your boat. They stink to high heaven. They're worthless. If you're like me, you'd rather not catch one than catch one. But. To each their own."
199002,tbayboy,2008-05-09 03:17:00,1497,Great post - wonderful primer for everyone looking to get into the urban pike fun.  Thanks for the laugh Dan (if only it weren't so true)
199003,irishfield,2008-05-09 03:20:00,26272,Dan... you're so spoiled !!! How many days 'till August??? lol  Ric.. great write up for the pike challenged.
199004,mistyriver1,2008-05-09 03:22:00,600,Great post Ric.  thanks for taking the time.
199008,bpsbassman,2008-05-09 03:33:00,941,Great seminar Rick!  Thanks for taking the time to put all that together. Much appreciated.  Can't wait to try out some of those strategies when I get out Pike Fishing in a few weeks.
199015,jediangler,2008-05-09 03:41:00,1923,"You're the man FHR, very unselfish, what this board needs is more people like you."
199016,Raf,2008-05-09 03:44:00,3495,"Nicely done Ric..  I wouldn't pay too much attn to what Dan said, he'd rather fish for bait."
199019,Greencoachdog,2008-05-09 03:52:00,8163,  Yer such a wet blanket on the Pike porn Dan!!!   Excellent write up Ric!!!
199024,mepps,2008-05-09 03:57:00,1301,nice job Ric!
199028,johnnyb,2008-05-09 04:11:00,3413,"wow Ric...that's a great post!  I wandered downtown the other day, and my biggest problem was where to park, but, I did find a few spots.  A post like that is a real confidence booster, which really helps when you're down there and not sure if you're in the right spot or not.  Thanks!"
199030,FishHeadRic,2008-05-09 04:13:00,226,"Hey guys, Thanks. Dan, what can I say, I just love the toothy critters. Even if we had the brookies you've got up there I'd still be going after the pike  Ric"
199034,Benti_11,2008-05-09 04:26:00,13,"That was great,ill be heading out tomorrow and hope i can use some of what you said to help"
199036,ehg,2008-05-09 04:29:00,2666,"That's a lot of work and a good primer on urban pike fishing, there FHR. With water high and weeds down through most of S. Ontario, one could probably use the deep diver x-rap or other slightly deeper presentations as well this spring.  The cool thing is catching decent fish at the foot of CN tower.  There are some GTA brook trout spots no one goes to, but you must know that.  Real nice job,  ehg"
199040,Benti_11,2008-05-09 04:39:00,13,What if i was to use a J-7 Rap that goes only a few inches under the water would that still work? or should i use something deeper?
199043,FishHeadRic,2008-05-09 05:03:00,226,"Benti, Your best searching lure would be a #5 Mepps spinner or a spoon like a 5/8ths cleo. Just point the rod tip down to keep the lure low. When they were deep I'd drag the bottom to find the green weeds. Once l'd find these weeds keep working through them with the Mepps or put on a longer leader that would sink an X-rapps or HJ-12 down there. (l make my own floro leaders) Another lure to think about would be the rapala count down, a shad-rap or a rat-l-trap.  FHR"
199044,tdotfisherman,2008-05-09 05:29:00,317, That better be the case when I go up to Sioux Lookout at the end of May...
199045,mikeymikey,2008-05-09 06:30:00,376,thank you (again).
199057,The Urban Fisherman,2008-05-09 11:06:00,2050,"brookies are for woosies!  Just kidding Dan - FHR, awesome write up dude.  I don't even live in the GTA anymore, or plan to pike fish in the area anytime soon but I still couldn't stop reading until the end.  I'm sure it'll help out a fair bit of people.  Cheers"
199058,Clampet,2008-05-09 11:06:00,1947," I am of the same mind when it comes to Pike... but heh, Fishead Ric, you sure put together a very good article on the Pike scene!"
199060,motv8tr,2008-05-09 11:12:00,2587,"Ric, as always, excellent post.  After reading it I don't think that only those who fish in the city will benefit from it  Maureen"
199061,Victor,2008-05-09 11:23:00,1609,That's alot of great info FHR! Thanks for sharing it with everybody.
199149,007,2008-05-09 13:48:00,537,Thanks for a great pike fishing write-up - I think a lot of people will find it useful.  I bet having written that you wish you were out on the lakeshore or islands catching those toothy critters - I know I am.  007
199155,FishHeadRic,2008-05-09 14:03:00,226,"Mr Bond, There's nothing l'd like more then the fresh smell of irony  fish-slime on my hands but the 30-40 lb stripers flooding out of the Hudson right now will help me in my rough time Maureen, hope things have been good with you. Victor, np thanks. Jed, Dan's just upset cause he knows l'd live-line brookie under a slip float, if I could"
