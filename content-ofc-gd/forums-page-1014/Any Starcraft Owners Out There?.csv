214849,Andy,2008-06-13 00:14:00,330,"Gonna look at a 2006 Starcraft Starfish in the next day or two. Not much on the web about them. Any help? Thx in advance, Andy."
214857,Sinker,2008-06-13 00:24:00,8692,"I have a starcraft. Its a 16ft aluminum. Tough as nails. It takes a beating like you've never seen. I hunt and fish from it, from ice out until I have to break ice with it. I'll be keeping her forever.  Sinker"
214858,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-13 00:24:00,314,"Got one here, When neighbour moved i bought it.  Seems fine...      new neighbour was at marina pricing boats as he wants one to and said there wasnt much difference in price between mine and a lund.  Im sure someone here will have better input.   Mines just a river runner"
214859,Sinker,2008-06-13 00:27:00,8692,"Mine is built by Brunswick. A lund the same year, is the same hull I believe."
214860,Clampet,2008-06-13 00:27:00,1947,I've been out in their 22' Islander and it was great! They used that boat for 25+ years.
214861,rpsmith,2008-06-13 00:28:00,28,I too have a 16 footer and hunt and fish out of her----the hull is truly strong....

214865,Dondorfish,2008-06-13 00:32:00,1000,"I have a 22 foot Islander - and love it!  It handled the big waves on Quinte, last November, like a trooper!   Hope this helps  Don  "
214868,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-13 00:37:00,314,"One comment the dealer made to my neighbour about my starcraft was the amount of rivits used.....   LOTS  I noticed a princecraft that was here a few weeks ago had only about half the amount and walls seemed paper thin.  I picked up boat, motor(20hp evinrude), trailer, fish finder, life jackets, all saftey stuff and extra prop for 1500$  Boat and motor are a 1991 mint shape.  Almost no marks on it."
214870,Dondorfish,2008-06-13 00:40:00,1000,"Not sure  if this link will come through, but check it out.  http://www.trader.ca/powerpage/details.asp...mp;adid=7012470  Looks like a nice boat! Don     SORRY  WRONG BOAT  LOL!"
214932,bow slayer,2008-06-13 01:51:00,1074,I have a 2001 starcraft starfire 160  side console. I love the boat seems to be quality made. I have been out in some friends boats  one a princecraft the other a smokercraft and all of us prefer mine for a number of reasons. No complaints.
214946,Kerry,2008-06-13 02:10:00,383,Mines a 72 16' bowrider. I've seen the same hull design as mine in ones as new as the early 90's.The only real difference is the interior layouts and extra goodies installed.Solid Solid boats.I also trailer mine exclusively and don't have leakage problems whatsoever.Can't ask for much more out of a 36 yr old hull. Kerry
214988,Mike the Pike,2008-06-13 04:51:00,3421, I don't know about getting one of these this owner is getting skunked alot since his purchase.  I remember his other boat lots of reports with fish pics.  Hey did I take that second pic lol.  Don
215004,Dondorfish,2008-06-13 09:32:00,1000,"   Hey Andy - pay no attention to this guy - he's one of those ""TILLER GUYS"" - LOL  - and Mike: I thought it was Percher who took the picture.   Don   "
215010,lew,2008-06-13 09:59:00,12767,I bought a new Starcraft tiller in '86 and another new one in '90 and they were both excellent boats and it's a make I would highly recommend to anyone.
215055,Disspatcher,2008-06-13 11:52:00,73,I run with a 1991 19.5' SFM190 w/115hp MM and 15 hp kicker...awesome great lakes boat! 
215109,Mike01,2008-06-13 13:51:00,378,"I have an 2006 D-star, takes everything that Nipissing can dish out!  The interior is kinda cheap though.  Does 32mph with full gas and two people with a 50 merc. "
215131,Andy,2008-06-13 14:29:00,330,"Your responses have been helpful.  Everyone says that the boat's are solid and well built. I looked at a used one a couple months ago, and did think that the instrumentation didn't seem as fancy or polished as some other makes. I hope to check it out in the next day or two. Andy"
