213628,lew,2008-06-10 15:40:00,12767,"They used to have an excellent reputation  at one time and nobody could touch their prices on motors. When I bought my 90 Merc in '99 I shopped all over and Boatland beat the lowest price by $400.  I think  over the years though,  the good name has slipped and I've heard some bad stuff from different friends who have purchased from them so you may want to get some opinions before you make any big $$$$ purchases.  My brother purchased a new boat/motor/trailer package from them a few years back on the condition they included a spare trailer tire & mounting bracket but when he went to pick up  his new rig  a week later they refused to give him the spare, even though it was written in the purchase agreement.  After a lengthy arguement, they offered him a USED spare and it was only after a lot ""discussion"" that they finally agreed to honor their end of the deal and include the lousy $100 spare & $20 bracket.  I also have a friend who purchased a new 30' house trailer from them and had  trouble getting warranty work covered on items that didn't work the FIRST DAY he received to trailer.  Would I recommend a purchase from Boatland Canada ?? ....NOPE....but thats only my opinion."
213640,Pigeontroller,2008-06-10 16:08:00,2793,I would highly recomend Bay City Marine in Hamilton.
213644,edmichit,2008-06-10 16:20:00,145,"their merc motor pricing is still the best in the market. Well at least it was last summer, when i needed a new motor in a hurry."
213674,Rich,2008-06-10 17:29:00,3927,"My dad bought his bass boat from Frank at Boatland about 12 years ago, when they were still in Bowmanville. Always dealt well with them afterward when it came to repairs, customizations, etc. Thought he hasn't dealt with them for a few years now."
213680,bassjnkie,2008-06-10 17:34:00,1101,"Bought my boat in 2004 from boatland, never again. I paid for a Lawrance finder and Minn trolling moter, he said that the contract said Motorguide and the finder Humminbird 100 LOL. On a good note I paid my boat $5000 cheaper than BPS. But do not buy from Boatland, you will regret it.  Daniel OCH"
213689,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-10 17:43:00,0,"I bought my boat from Boatland and I couldn't be more pleased. I had absolutely no issues with my boat, so I'm not sure how their customer service is but their prices cant be beat and the boats are in excellant condition. I recall them throwing in a few things after also. Good guys."
213723,Meely,2008-06-10 18:25:00,282,"I bought a boat from them back in 2000. Price was great....post purchase service ....horrible. I had oredered a cover for my boat at the time of purchase. 8 weeks later, I still did not have it. When I followed up with  the sales rep he told me it was on back order. What the rep did not know was I had already spoken with the manufacturer and they told me no mooring cover had ever been ordered with the boat. I mentioned this to the sales rep later....... funny....had the cover in 2 days.  If price is all you want...go for it....if you are looking for post purchase service.....I probably would say no.  Meely"
213801,JorgeCarlos,2008-06-10 20:02:00,109,"i should have asked this before i put money down....  hope boat will be on time, they told me mid June  is a Q5f Tahoe"
213846,Sinker,2008-06-10 21:30:00,8692,"  Good luck with that!!!!  I'm one concession south of them, and I wouldn't go in there for spark plugs!!!  I got royally screwed around by them.......I would never go back, and I tell everyone I know the same!!!!  Sinker"
214266,fishnpro,2008-06-11 19:38:00,93,I went there to go and get my motor inspected by them and they told me you need a new motor......he even had one priced out already when I came back to pick it up. Id stay far away from that place if I we`re you.
214276,tonyb,2008-06-11 19:58:00,1637,Ditto! Just ordered my Lund from them and they had good prices compared to some other Lund dealers.  Ask to speak with Clarence  Tony
214282,JorgeCarlos,2008-06-11 20:15:00,109,Tony i did not see a single Lund the times i been there
214322,Gerritt,2008-06-11 22:16:00,6129,Look at the quote he posted... he is talking about Bay City Marine.  G
214335,sonny,2008-06-11 23:00:00,511,"AHHH   boatland,,,,been waiting a long time to tell the story..My first boat should have been a 16 foot tritan instead of the legend boat that i have now,,,((in retrospect i have a much better boat then i would have))  This is the story  My father went to the boat show that year and saw the boatthat we would buy,,,he worked out the deal,,and put down a large deposit,,,,,now from the time the paperwork was signed and picking up the boat they kept loosing paperwork and fishy things happening,,, now that spring arived my father called and told them we'd be picking up the boat the following week,,,we called the night before and the next day when we arived they scrambled for a half an hour looking for our boat,,,then finally thay pull it up from the back yard with water,,,and i mean alot of water pouring out of it,,,,then they informed us that it was not ready,,hmm  no kidding,,and they had taken the motor off it and anouther one had to be put on it,,,asked us to come back in five hours to pick it up,,,after our 2 hour ride to get there,,,so off we headed to the casino and back in five hours,,,,boat is all ready,,,Great i thought,,,we go in to do all the paperwork,,,the deal that my father HAD IN WRITING was changed to the tune of 7200.00,,over the course ofthe payments,,,,this is called a bait and switch,and illegal,,  so short and short my father asked for his deposit back,,,and unhook the boat from his truck,,,,,  was a terrible day for us,,,,one that should have been great  If you would like this type of day,,,,by all means buy a boat from boatland!!"
214337,misfish,2008-06-11 23:19:00,29133,"You got to be direct and tell them what you want and DO NOT BACK DOWN. I dont care who the dealer is. My pop ,as some now know, bought his new Lund. He bought the demo(from the Sportsmens Show) ,but it got damaged during it,s travels. They had no problem telling him this,and they gave him a brand new one. Saddly the sales guy that was at the show is no longer employed by them , pop was having a bit of a fight on his hands with getting what was promised,but they are doing thier best to make his purchase right. To me thats service, and if you want your customers to come back,this is what you do. Oh the retailer is Baysville Marine. They have a 2  :  from me."
214351,Sinker,2008-06-11 23:56:00,8692," If I had a nickel for everytime I heard a story like that about boatland!!  I'm tellin ya, STAY AWAY from them!!  Sinker"
214493,Jer,2008-06-12 11:26:00,1426,"I bought a new 70 hp Johnson from them in 2000...by far they were the best price, by as much as $1500 if I remember correctly.  Never had a reason to go back, thank goodness. I've heard alot of similiar stories as above since."
214510,aniceguy,2008-06-12 12:08:00,1094,"  cant beat his attitude, and service...was there yesterday, more lunds then any thing else..."
214511,aniceguy,2008-06-12 12:08:00,1094,tony when does the Lund come??
214530,tonyb,2008-06-12 12:49:00,1637,"Don't mean to hijack this thread or veer off topic but... They said mid-august but I'm banking on more like mid-september...Lund hasn't even updated their website for the 2009 models yet.  I think they change to the next model year sometime in July???  Either way, I don't imagine they will be changing much from the 2008 to the 2009 1900 Pro-V.  Right now I'm busy buying all the safety gear, electronics, rod holders, etc"
215019,pikehunter,2008-06-13 10:44:00,1659," I'm impressed! Five hours in a casino and you still had money left to buy a boat!  Sounds like this is a dealer that has a lot to learn about service, the old saying holds water doesn't it? ""You get what you pay for."" Service comes at a cost, it isn't free, the lowest price isn't always the best price."
