The bartender asks, “What’s wrong?” Dawg looks at the bartender through Teary eyes and between sobs says, “I married a beautiful woman two days ago. She’s a natural blonde, twenty-five, intelligent, a marvelous cook, a meticulous housekeeper, Extremely sensitive to my wants and needs, very giving, my best friend, and intensely passionate in bed.” The bartender stares at Dawg for a brief moment and says, “But that sounds great! You have what every man wants in a woman, so why are crying?” Dawg looks at the bartender and says, “I can’t remember where I live!”"
