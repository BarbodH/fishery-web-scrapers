214517,Billy - Curtiss,2008-06-12 12:31:00,241,Does anyone know where I can purchase tackle in the Markdale/Traverston area? I'm heading up to the Rocky Saugeen tomorrow and need some of those Panther Martins!

214534,Billy - Curtiss,2008-06-12 13:00:00,241, Ha! Thanks. I will have my tourney sign! I'm hoping for better luck....my May 24 northern excursion for lakers turned out to be a snow / hail filled skunking.

214604,Billy - Curtiss,2008-06-12 16:58:00,241, Thanks. I actually opted to do just that and have just returned from Canadian Tire. Less $100.00 of course!
214606,Billy - Curtiss,2008-06-12 17:00:00,241, That'd be amazing dude! I tried calling you moments ago. Answer your phone! Today is prime for Harbour pike. Let's hit it brah!
