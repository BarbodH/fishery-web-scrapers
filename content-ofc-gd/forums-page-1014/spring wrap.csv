212232,Raf,2008-06-07 08:29:00,3495,"remember this?  really wasn't that long ago.      thought i'd throw that in for our first heat wave.  spring has been a pretty soggy one here.   other than the wknd we broke ice, it's been cold and wet.  we've fished trout and a bit of walleye and pike with some success.. no luck on huge pike this year.   so hear are some troot.   this wknd is the muskie opener and so, season II begins.  day one, 10 mins into openwater season.    10 mins later - peel back the layers its sunburn time.                    "
212242,mattyk,2008-06-07 11:30:00,2110,"some great looking fish, thanks for the report! Good luck on the musky season!"
212244,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-07 11:51:00,1362,Dang those are some nice lookin' lakers!!!!! GL with the skies  I've gotta wait until June 20th here on the Ottawa for the season to open
212247,Smokey,2008-06-07 12:15:00,1278,Great stuff Raf. Thanks a for all the great pics.
212263,johnnyb,2008-06-07 13:24:00,3413,"beyootie trout, eh!  But, no,  I DON'T remember pulling a laker that nice out of the ice...    But I do remember the ice fishing....hard to believe it wasn't that long ago compared to today's temp."
212334,Greencoachdog,2008-06-07 19:29:00,8163,Nice fat Troots!!!
212369,Raf,2008-06-07 22:29:00,3495,thank boys. i've been fighting a cold for the better part of a week now.  my muskie opener is on hold.  the action tends to improve as the season wears on anyhow (in my experience).  the trout fishn is a great way to kick off the season.
214965,ehg,2008-06-13 03:10:00,2666,"Great bunch of lakers, excellent photos! Missed this post somehow originally. Thanks for posting, ehg"
214977,TennesseeGuy,2008-06-13 03:56:00,957,Nice going with the lakers.  Thanks for bringing us the report.  Also a pretty good stable of fishing partners there.  Sometimes the odds are against the fish.
215065,Joey,2008-06-13 12:09:00,9122,That is one huge trout you got there Raf.  Your season is starting out great again by the looks of it.  Super report and pics.  Joey
215100,Reef Runner,2008-06-13 13:21:00,981,Amazing photos Raf.  Thanks for sharing.  Did you have to tweek the ripplin'redfin when you switched to single hooks? Better hookups?
215112,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-13 14:03:00,0,Some very Impressive trout there! And the lake has some amazing looking shoreline!
215188,tonyb,2008-06-13 16:58:00,1637,"Very nice Raf, gotta love the colours on the inland lakers, just beauty!"
215200,Whopper,2008-06-13 17:25:00,2174,"Raf, JP and Ben's spring laker report from last year was one of the best reports that I have ever read.  Don't mean to step one anyones toes here but, Besides that one and a couple others from Raf & JP as well as Moosbunk & Solopaddler's reports they don't come any better than that.  TG your a very wise man!"
215206,Raf,2008-06-13 17:49:00,3495,"^^^^^  I did not pay him to say that  reefrunner, we switch out trebles for singles on all our lures for spring trout.   be they body baits, spoons, spinners etc.  we don't bring most into the boat, just unbutton them boatside like the 2nd last pic.   if we photoed every single fish, there'd be way too many pics in this thread.  trebles and trout are like velcro and they end up getting them in the eyes, gills... not so good if you are planning on releasing them.  my opinion, the lures have more action with singles too.  other than swapping the hooks, no further modifications."
