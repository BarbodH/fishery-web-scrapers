213197,rickster,2008-06-09 20:31:00,495,Just saw on tsn that ctv bought the rights to the song after CBC opted not to renew Looks like the song will live on TSN now
213199,Kirk,2008-06-09 20:36:00,347,I think they have Dave Hodge as well...all they need is Maclean and Cherry and the silent takeover is complete.
213258,misfish,2008-06-09 22:08:00,29133,"Maclean and Cherry  I was wonder if they would even bring them back.  Maclean not sure,but Cherry sells."
213261,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 22:14:00,7971,"Seems wrong....but I wonder what the ramifications are....  So, can it be called the HNIC theme if HNIC is owned by CBC?  If the theme is synonymous with HNIC can someone else use it for hockey?...is it part of the identity of the show?  Hmmmmm......  Then again, it's just a song right?"
