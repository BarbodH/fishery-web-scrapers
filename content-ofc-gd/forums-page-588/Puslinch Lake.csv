538185,danbouck,2011-01-11 23:58:00,4380,Anybody been out to Puslinch lately and know how thick the ice is. I'm going out with with my 4 year on Saturday. If the ice is safe I will take out the quad otherwise I'm gonna hit Shades Mill.
538187,kevin booth,2011-01-12 00:01:00,57,i was out 2 weekends ago and theres lots of ice 12 to 14 inches and lots of bike and sleds and dirt bikes on the ice we had our quad out as well.
538189,danbouck,2011-01-12 00:14:00,4380, Was that before we had the warm couple of days?
538199,vinnimon,2011-01-12 00:44:00,2593,"I spoke to someone yesterday that fishs puslinch often. The ice is aparantely 8 to 9"" according to him. Maybe more"
538210,basketclam,2011-01-12 00:58:00,115,"Haven't been on Puslinch itself, but over the Christmas break there was a good 8 inches of ice on a couple of ponds very nearby.  Made for a couple of good games of shinny with the in-laws.  This was before the couple of days of rain, but we've had cold weather since then so I'd be surprised if the ice wasn't in good shape."
538250,danbouck,2011-01-12 01:50:00,4380,I'll keep checking the rest of the week. Don't want to take any chances especially when my son is with me.
538254,Cookslav,2011-01-12 02:00:00,1457,"My bro was out there on the weekend, said he was on a solid 7"" Fishing was slow, but he managed a couple dinks. Good luck out there"
538539,jediangler,2011-01-12 22:08:00,1923,"For safety sake I'd be taking the little one to Shade's as he won't have to dodge nutcases on their sleds. Seriously, you stand a much better chance of being injured by sleds on Puslinch than any issues with ice thickness. You also won't have to breathe carbon monoxide all day."
538573,danbouck,2011-01-12 23:31:00,4380, We were gonna take the quad    Can't get enough of the smell of 2 stroke!

540436,Spiel,2011-01-17 14:42:00,9065," I was going to post that as well. Puslinch is best avoided for fishing IMHO especially with young'ns. Little lake right beside it would be a safer bet or as JA mentioned, Shade's Mills or perhaps Valens."
