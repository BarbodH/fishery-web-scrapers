540768,skeeter,2011-01-18 03:56:00,1907,"  i went out sunday and came back today. i caught 2 perch on sunday. so i decided i was going to lower the size for monday and keep the ones that were over 8"" and had some good meat to them. Monday seemed to prove very good for me, anything under 8 1/2"" went back, anything over that was good went for a ride to scarborough--LOL. It wasnt until i got home that i pulled them out of the bag to count them. good thing i quit when i did. It was -28 over night, but the hut was nice and warm!      even the cats were impressed!! "

540914,fishnsled,2011-01-18 16:15:00,3520,"Nice going Dann. That cat picture reminds of a story. I was getting some perch all laid out and ready to be cleaned up outside. There was this cat hanging around and keeping an eye on my catch. Went into to the house to grab a beer and when I came out the cat had grabbed his dinner and was running away.  Oh well, it was a stray and I'm sure he could have used a good meal."
