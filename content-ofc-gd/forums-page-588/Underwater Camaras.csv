540132,moosehead,2011-01-16 19:29:00,90,"i am looking for info from people that have them and what models they have and if they are happy with them or not, also a good place to buy from. Would be using it ice fishing as well as from the boat in summer. Which one should i be looking at? Anyone have the new one from vexilar?"
540134,vinnimon,2011-01-16 19:42:00,2593,"  My aquaview scout srt has been good to me, no issues on my part so far. Had it for a few years. Mind you I take very good care of it. The only thing I dont like is the tripod and ball for the cable. I ordered 4 of them today, just the rubber ball. They pop off very easily and down the hole they go!"

540139,Dondorfish,2011-01-16 20:05:00,1000,Wait for Terry to get in from fishing Simcoe - he does some amazing videos with his camera - I think he has a marcum.  Tracker (Don)
540141,johnl,2011-01-16 20:08:00,197,I have the fish tv it works pretty good for ice fishing.It's black and white and it's a bit of a pain to spin the camera but it makes finding the fish way easier and the price is cheap.If you get a rechargeable 12 volt your good to go sometimes you do have to put your hand over it to block the glare.all in all not bad.
540163,Terry,2011-01-16 21:18:00,14456,I have a colour marcum and it works well I hear the now have even a better camera on it and it gives depth and temp...max cable I could get was 60 or 80 ft can't remember right now  what I am plying with now is this it has 150ft of cable  http://cgi.ebay.ca/100ft-Underwater-Video-Camera-Motorized-0-360-View-/350388806182?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item5194cce226     
540209,Tdel,2011-01-16 22:56:00,393,"I have been looking at underwater camera's for quite a while now and couldn't decide which camera I wanted. All cameras seemed to be the same so just before Christmas as a last resort I decided I wouldn't spend a lot of money and was going to get the Fish Tv7.  It had what I wanted and 100ft cable. I was concerned about the infrared lights, viewing screen in sunlight, optics etc.  I had looked at the Marcum VS625SD camera when it first came out but didn't want to spend that much on a camera at the time. Before buying the fish tv7 I took another look at the Marcum and thought this is the one for me.  It is a new model this year and there aren't a lot of reviews but all the ones I found were positive.  I have read about the Sony camera that is on previous models of Marcum, Cabela's and Vexilar cameras. The reviews said good things about the Sony optics. The VS625SD (6 inch screen) has Sonyâ€™s New Super HAD II CCD optics which is the same as the VS825SD model (8inch screen). It also has an auto adjusting iris for bright or dark situations. You can also switch from colour to black and white. It has on-screen camera depth, temperature, camera direction, and battery status. It comes with 75ft of cable.  Measurements can be converted to metric if desired.  I would have preferred 100ft of cable but the 75ft will do me just fine.  I believe Young_one has either this model(VS625SD)or the VS825SD.  Tom."

540497,moosehead,2011-01-17 17:18:00,90,"the marcums look good and definately on my short list, also really interested in the new one from vexilar the fish scout-1000 anyone have one?"
540506,Terry,2011-01-17 17:56:00,14456," it sounds really good but on simcoe 100ft of cable is more usable.. oh and they state prolonged exposure to extreme cold will affect the monitor ...extreme cold, welcome to canada"
540515,BillM,2011-01-17 18:16:00,17367,"Terry, how does your camera work in 80+ft of water?"
540546,Uncle Buck,2011-01-17 19:11:00,1000,"junk, got rid of mine after the first year...  would never buy one again..."
540550,Terry,2011-01-17 19:24:00,14456," really really depends on water clarity and snow cover  this is mine from Sunday.. one and a half ft of snow on top of the ice 85ft of water  and the view on the monitor was better then what my cheap recorder records  <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_jlzaQ_4I8?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_jlzaQ_4I8?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_jlzaQ_4I8?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>  this one the long version   <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znA0cLP3v0M?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znA0cLP3v0M?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znA0cLP3v0M?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>"
540628,moosehead,2011-01-17 23:09:00,90,nice videos! was that with the marcum or the one from e-bay you posted above?
540630,Terry,2011-01-17 23:14:00,14456,"that was my eBay one  the reason I didn't take the marcum is with it being 85 ft deep and the marcum having only 80 ft of cable, well you can see the math  and it was the first time I had a chance to try the new eBay one in deep water"
540810,Rich,2011-01-18 11:31:00,3927,I had a Fish TV. It was cheap but did the job just fine. Lasted 3 seasons of hard use and abuse before it finally bit the dust.
