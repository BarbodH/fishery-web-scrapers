I spent 6 hours on Friday fishing the 2nd line of Oro, ice was anywhere from 2.5-4 inches thick depending on location.  In 6 hours, I caught 12 herring fishing various depths from 65-113, no lakers or whities to be seen.  Terribly slow, I never skunked once last year, and my first time on the laker grounds this year I skunked... UH OH. Yesterday I head to Big Bay Point and immediately saw action on my screen in 100feet of water.  I dropped down a laker taker and had fish all over it, but soon realized they were just herring again.  Lost two good fish on the laker taker, they were short biters, one was a whitie that I saw about 20 feet down before she unbuckled.  Finally switched to a williams spoon and caught a few more herring, 4 smelt and finally but a couple lakers on the ice.  I stayed in the same spot for 5 hours yesterday, didnt feel like moving because A) It was freezing out and  I have a slipped disc in my back and dragging a 100lbs hut through 1.5 feet of fresh snow was not fun at all.  Tough Week, there's TONS of bait out there! Let's hope the fishing picks up!  "
540429,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-17 14:30:00,2690,"Ouch, on the back.  Nice on the lakers.  Looks like the herring are coming back, big time...should start seeing some really big lakers in the next few years, I would think."
540432,BUSTER,2011-01-17 14:32:00,1336,  Ummmm Lakers  Let me know when you want to head out again.
540434,misfish,2011-01-17 14:36:00,29133,"Nice fish Steve and report.Lot of snow to be dragg,n thats for sure.  Was there much action below the 2nd? Angler wise?  Good spot for a short walk if I can get off earlly.Bar and rod in hand.   See the idiot out in the middle with all the huts.  Tried to tell me theres 7""-8"" out there."
540448,alphaalpha,2011-01-17 15:27:00,475,"Sucks about the skunk but at least you got into some the next outing, nice work!  How thick was the ice out of BBP?  2.5-4"" out of oro is too thin for my comfort level."
540451,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-17 15:32:00,2050,"Nice Lakers buddy!  I miss those slimy old dogs... Grew up ice fishing them on Lake Wanapetei... It's good to see that even a seasoned angler such as yourself takes a hit from time to time though! haha  Cheers, Ryan"
540452,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-17 15:35:00,3761,"Hey man great job, can't wait to get out there!"
540480,steverowbotham,2011-01-17 16:27:00,1800,Ice at BBP was also in the 2.5-4 inch range.  I had so many people try telling me they were on 6-7 inches of ice... hope they dont measure their fish the same way... lol
540483,BillM,2011-01-17 16:43:00,17367,"Ice off of 2nd was really dicey, thinnest I've seen all year (This includes BP)...  At least the ice at BP is nice and black, 2nd line is a real mix.   Same thing with my yesterday (fished BBP)..  Lots of herring, lots of smelt and lost a brute of a laker right at the hole.   I can't believe the amount of herring this year, it's crazy..  And yes, that snow made for a very interesting walk yesterday pulling my Clam, lol.  Good job Steve!"
540505,alphaalpha,2011-01-17 17:56:00,475,"  Thanks, still definately too thin for me.  Hopefully tomorrow's impending warm spell doesn't do too much damage to it and I can get out next weekend."
540514,BillM,2011-01-17 18:14:00,17367,"Hopefully the warmth melts some of that snow, then it locks up again.   Quick and dirty way of gaining 2inches of ice"
540519,Spiel,2011-01-17 18:21:00,9065, A good quick melt down of snow followed by some frigid temps is just what we need.
540533,12footspringbok,2011-01-17 18:47:00,459, No way we need something to keep them walkers close to shore....
540587,ehg,2011-01-17 21:45:00,2666,Nice lakers there Steve
540603,misfish,2011-01-17 22:23:00,29133," Hey,I know yer fadder,you be nice.LOL  Yeah,a nice melt down of that fluffy stuff would be nice and a quick freeze."
540829,steverowbotham,2011-01-18 12:59:00,1800,lol
