540419,mistaredone,2011-01-17 13:52:00,913,I'm not sure how I got on their mailing list but my best guest would be when I sighned up for thier rewards program.  Flyers once a month and a catolouge once year!  The only better mail is Musky Hunter mag:) 
540527,PainInTheBass,2011-01-17 18:33:00,102,I believe it is sent to you when you join their rewards program.  I also got mine.  This is bad when you want to save money...
539735,JohnF,2011-01-15 16:08:00,3494,Isn't it funny how much pleasure we can get from perusing a nice thick shiny fishing tackle catalogue? I'm not even a big BPS shopper. Why bother when you have good local shops? But that doesn't mean I won't get hours of pleasure from looking at all the pretty pictures and checking out the latest gear offerings.  Happy reading y'all JF
539736,Garry2Rs,2011-01-15 16:13:00,1425,Beware of the Bait Monkey! He lives in those shiny pages...HAHAHA.
539737,Rod Caster,2011-01-15 16:14:00,5784,Pretty pictures and shiny lures! That is good entertainment. haha.
539738,JohnF,2011-01-15 16:18:00,3494, Having a nice thick catalogue to peruse is a lot like staying at yer place. Your stuff just has fingerprints on it - and you probably have more line than any BPS store - and the dvds are already open and ready to watch without paying for 'em.  JF
539752,Roy,2011-01-15 16:43:00,13728,I haven't received a BPS catalogue since they opened shop in Vaughan. That used to always be one of my best mail days......WAYYYYYYYY up on the list compared to property taxes.
539766,uglyfish,2011-01-15 17:31:00,981,haha got mine yesterday too. me and my 2 year old son have been pawing through the pages making mental notes of all the goodies we want.

539803,mistaredone,2011-01-15 19:35:00,913,I got real excited on the boat prices then realized they at in US dollars. Bummer
539807,Muskieman,2011-01-15 19:49:00,2472, the Canadian $  is now worth  1.00959 USD... go south and you'll actually save more.  Randy 
539813,Roy,2011-01-15 19:59:00,13728,Wow! 95 cents on the $100!!!
539815,SlowPoke,2011-01-15 20:05:00,2984,Don't joke Roy! You know how much savings that would be on a good used Queen Mary II? Neither do I.
539826,GBW,2011-01-15 20:39:00,8460,I got one too I had to get my kids to hide it from me...
539827,kickingfrog,2011-01-15 20:42:00,8333,I got mine in the mail early this week. I didn't realize how much stuff I was going to need for my fly-in in September. ' Cause none of the gear I currently have is suitable.
539844,Billy Bob,2011-01-15 22:07:00,5865, And after the bank transfer fees it will still be less per dollar...
539967,pikehunter,2011-01-16 10:44:00,1659,"Got mine a few days ago too. That quote reminds me...When I was a small little guy I used to look forward to the day the Sears catalogue would show up in the mail hmmmm, the pretty pictures eh   :rofl2: Maybe ya have to be old to understand..."
539976,lew,2011-01-16 11:28:00,12766,"It's funny,  I've spent a fair bit of $$$$ @ BPS yet I don't think I've ever received a catalogue from them, yet I've only purchased a couple items from Cabelas and receive catalogues from them regularily, infact even when I moved north I still get them even though I never informed them of the move."

540268,pikehunter,2011-01-17 01:05:00,1659,"Lew, I joined up for a comp (point)card this past year, 2010, maybe that's why they sent me a catalogue."
