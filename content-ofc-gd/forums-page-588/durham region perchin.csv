540292,kingofthesteelhead,2011-01-17 01:55:00,140,Decided to go icefishing today but did not want to travel far.Went to an area about 25 minutes from home.Was not disappointed as I ended up with 14 decent perch and numerous small ones. All fish were caught on small plastic shad bodies and tiny jigs tipped with power maggots.Was fishing in 5-6 feet of water.

540658,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-18 00:19:00,2582,Good stuff.....nice clean looking perch Ted. Couch has been good but as you know you have to cull through the ones with the yellow grubs in them.  I'd love to get out there with you next weekend. I love sight fishing them shallow from inside the fish trap.  Enjoy the fish fry
