540181,walleyemaster,2011-01-16 21:57:00,325,"Hi guys would like to see how you carry your stuff  I had this aluminum box made. i measured the back of my machine then i had my buddy make me up a cad drawing, i bought a sheet of aluminum 4X8 and i had a guy cut and weld the box for me..it cost me about $260 in total i know its kinda costly but it should last a long time.. i could have cheaped out and bought the regular aluminum instead of the checker plated kind, but i think it looks much better.. i can fit all my tackle, fishing rods, drinks and live bait bucket with lots of room to spare.. the best part of all is there are no holes in my machine and i can remove box when i want..    "

540903,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-18 15:59:00,10439,  I've gone as fast as 130K with my stuff not falling out. That's what all the cam & ratchet straps ar for.
