540321,ehg,2011-01-17 02:48:00,2666,"Every winter would try to get out on L.Ontario for some primo fishing, when the wind was light and right direction. Haven't done it yet this year but hope to when it all falls into place. With the lack of fishing reports thought i would post some past winter fish from 2003-2009. Wish i was there fishing now...       Browns...   It is cold out there       White Bass...        Many doubleheaders     Walleye       Bass are caught mostly OOS    Lots of sheepshead     Even carp hit lures in winter      Over half a decade of winters mixed here. Looking to get out to give this a try again soon."

540330,irishfield,2011-01-17 03:08:00,26272,Hope you can get out again this year .... many here (including myself)could learn from the drive that you have !!

540340,ehg,2011-01-17 03:24:00,2666,"Thanks Jacques, couple of hardy french canadian boys there enjoying fishing.  Thanks Wayne, look after my daughter first getting out fishing is close second. That gives me the drive"
540359,SlowPoke,2011-01-17 03:58:00,2984,I always look foward to those reports! I've got my fingers crossed for ya.
540372,l2p,2011-01-17 07:26:00,346,hey where can i get me one of those footballs?
540455,majorlifts,2011-01-17 15:44:00,171,"Ya wow! some of those are really dated eh. fantastic pics though, gets the juices flowin."
540464,WeedLine,2011-01-17 15:56:00,322,"Good fish guys. The colder, the better."
540465,beginner,2011-01-17 15:58:00,542,wow those are some good lookin fish..
540468,Harrison,2011-01-17 16:01:00,2202,"Hey Erik, it's been alittle ""tougher"" then yrs past there.  Been out a couple times this winter.  I will throw you a PM next time we go and you can hop in with us.  Good stable boat.  Have an eye on your PMs as you know it's just getting ready to heat up there."
540590,ehg,2011-01-17 21:54:00,2666,Thanks for all replies!  Most of those fish were caught in 2008 and 2009 where i am wearing the black hoodie. We will get out this winter no doubt when the conditions are right.  If you can do it i will go. Hard to launch a big boat with Frenchmans Bay frozen. Your buddy with the Alumacraft had to break ice at Bluffers then go for the long haul across lake just to fish there.   It was worth it he said.
540616,lew,2011-01-17 22:38:00,12766,"Hope you get a chance to get out there this winter Eric, I've always enjoyed reading your soft water winter reports over the years.  I still recall a very fat pike you hauled in a few years back."
540618,Terry,2011-01-17 22:42:00,14456,it looks damn cold out there  but some real nice fish out there too
540711,ehg,2011-01-18 01:58:00,2666,"Thanks Lew, glad you enjoyed the former reports. The pike were caught at Leslie Spit end of March back in 2003 Time sure flies. Here is a pic of the fattest buddy Dave caught. "
540806,lew,2011-01-18 10:31:00,12766,"Yeah, that's the picture I was talking about Eric, a real chunky fish, thanks for posting it again.  Hard to believe it's  already 8 years ago"
540862,craigdritchie,2011-01-18 14:33:00,1586,"Pretty fishies, but dude, if you haven't done it already go buy a survival suit!!!!!"
540918,Spiel,2011-01-18 16:28:00,9065," Might have been a good shot today, sure does fell warm out there."
