540620,Garnet,2011-01-17 22:46:00,2056,I did 20 years full time on the steelhead creeks now just small stuff from time to time. If the young bucks don't step up I will let it die.
540624,bigugli,2011-01-17 22:54:00,6138,"But you still help out some 20 years later. As we get older it is harder to do what we once did, like dragging shopping carts, etc... out of creeks. We still can play a part. For me it usually means hauling out garbage from time to time, and participating at the club level."
540761,Garnet,2011-01-18 03:40:00,2056,"For me picking other peoples garbage just piss me off. I hang signs take your trash or lose your fishing spot.  For me MNR needs about 100 meetings to make a plan for there next meeting, just don't have the patience.  Some of the most rewarding things I've done were conservation project related.  I was instrumental in having all creeks in Durham Region open to CNR all season. 25 years ago. Run into people every week that got into fishing because Oshawa creek was open 24/7."
539573,canadadude,2011-01-15 01:36:00,769,"Sorry Dan but OFAH has gotten you too HAHAHAHAHAH,.......think about it Dan seriously I know your a big OFAH fan, I also know you a big fisher/angler advocate so just look who you crawl into bed with. We may disagree but I still apreciate your opinion. I'm glad you commented on my opinion, it's good to here from you!! Again we may not always agree but I know how passionate you are and I still enjoy your thoughts on everything regaurding the outdoors"

539596,canadadude,2011-01-15 02:12:00,769,"Dude there better then opseu hahahahaha.........the OFAH they got there own TV show sucking us in, there Hollywood, no stone unturned for them, they bought a legitment concerned group of anglers/hunters and turned it into a money making enterprise and I mean big $$$$$, those dudes do crap and are walking out with 6+ figures. Keep on suporting the OFAH the dudes need 1000 acre's up in dryden for some chocolate buck racks. SCAM"
539608,chilli,2011-01-15 02:24:00,199,I delivered an OFAH hatchery to the Stevensville school today. This is a definite plus for the OFAH. These sheltered kids who get driven to school and locked indoors actually care about the water quality by the end of this program. If you look for negatives in any org you'll find them. Make sure you stop and check for positives while your at it.
539621,canadadude,2011-01-15 03:12:00,769,"This all sounds great but getting back to Aron's point perhaps we need a voice in govenment, a lobbying voice to get the fishers concerns out. The OFAH provides a cheap hatchery thats sweet, but we need a voice in government to protect thess kids fishery. A hatchery is a cheap toy, it sucks us all in, ain't that sweet' yayayayayaay, it's going to turn every dead beats life around. Come on dudes what the fishery/ natural resources needs is a lobby group an the OFAH ain't it, it was but they laid down for $$$$$$$$. They claim there spokeperson for fishers but do they lobby for us???? you be the judge. Fisheries in schools is cute but no steelies when I'm drifting sucks.No access to lakes up north sucks, no pens sucks, no stocking sucks, no hatcheries sucks, .  All I want to say really is the OFAH claims to be the voice of the Ontario/Hunter then lobby the government and do so quit linning your pockets and bring the OFAH back to what it was intended to do"
539622,canadadude,2011-01-15 03:16:00,769,"I could start a thread on the OFHA .......how long would that last hahahahah, Hey Roy start an OFHA thread, I'm scared heheheh"
539623,chilli,2011-01-15 03:22:00,199,"Remember that the OMNR has a huge budget and it deals with several divisions. Many think the OMNR is only responsible for fish and wildlife but a look at their website will show you that is only one department. This is the department our licence fees were meant to enhance but as mentioned before they reneged and now we're stuck with that user fee. Dropping that user fee could be a campaign platform though, especially seeing as anglers and hunters have a higher rate of volunteering with OMNR than the other sectors.  Some even think C.O's only deal with fish and wildlife but no. They have to deal with aggregate issues as well as illegal logging etc.  From the MNR website:  As for education I think they're pulling their hair out. They can't change the regs like the bait travel ban until it's been to the feds and it takes a minimum of two years to make such a change. They have partners such as the OFAH who drive home the invasive species and so do member clubs but still at our kids derby in St Catharines parents can be seen pouring bait buckets with unused bought bait into the harbour. Some people you just can't reach. Even though the MNR puts forth this effort they have no control over invasive laden ballasts of ships dumping into the great lakes and then refilling with fresh water for sale over seas. New laws might be on the way to stop this but globalization will worsten the toll.  The MNR and province are spending a great deal of energy on protecting our watersheds. It gets harder everyday as we grow but they don't. If you compare frontline mnr staff per capita now with lets say back in 1970 it will the 70's staff would likely dwarf todays. I agree more frontline staff such as co's and on the ground bio's should be funded. However the fight they have right now to protect headwaters and wetland is way bigger than ever before at least in my lifetime. Ask a farmer if the MNR is doing anything to protect watersheds. The MNR is willing to excuse them of their land rights to do so.  I agree with you that more/better cleaning stations, ramps etc would boost fishing tourism further but is that up to the mnr? Right now the Niagara Parks Commision is looking for feedback from the public. Submit your concerns and ideas for the new admin/board and don't stop with the NPC. Take this to your municipal government. That launch in Crystal Beach was lobbied for by anglers and hunters and built with partnerships. The St Catharines Game and Fish had that excellent ramp built not the OMNR or the province. If you can convince the City of Welland to reopen the ramps on the rec canal you've got a great start but then show them the facts on a good ramp verses that little stone ramp they put in the Welland River and they may see the investment return is similar in scale for both. Crappy ramp=crappy return.  As for garbage cans if you can find a way to keep the youth from tossing them in the water then your likly to be a good candidate to solve many of our urban problems :/  Great topic Aaron. It's always good to keep these discussion going."

540615,bigugli,2011-01-17 22:38:00,6138,"For those who feel the OFAH is worthless. A few questions.  1) What alternative is there?  2) Are you stepping up to start something better?  3) Where are the funds coming from to aggressively lobby the province?  4) If you are suggesting OFC carry the ball, are you suggesting that TJ do so out of his own pocket, or are you willing to pay a membership fee?  Like they say, talk is cheap. Look at a lot of your local clubs. The average age of membership in many is 60+. I don't see many younger anglers swelling the ranks, but I hear lots of them demanding action. Active membership creates action. Passive members sit and wait for others to do things for them and get nothing. It is that simple. For those who claim "" I did my part 20 and 30 years back"", what have you done lately. You still use the resource and it is still in need. More so now that fewer are willing to volunteer and pitch in. As for the politicians and their minions at the MNR.  If you want them to pay attention. Make them take notice. That means action. They may not like you, but they will not ignore you."

535443,bigugli,2011-01-06 18:01:00,6138,"As I had stated previously, our opposition is very well organized. We could do to learn a few lessons from them. We need to take up memberships in sporting clubs and use those clubs as our lobbying force. The OFAH is one umbrella lobby organization, but it is not enough. Clubs also have to develop a positive public presence with lots of media attention. We like our quiet and isolation when fishing and that is good, but our public image must be loud and visible."
535450,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-06 18:33:00,655," I believe that organizations like OFAH is very important and do a good job of lobbying, as well as the smaller clubs. I'm not trying to take anything away from them. Getting involved with OFAH and/or local groups help. I think it would only help our cause to add additional lobbying from anglers here, as the unique visitors on this site is substantial and mostly from Ontario."

539486,canadadude,2011-01-14 22:27:00,769,"Great thread Aron and you are absolutely right in what you're trying to say. The fisheries in Ontario have never been in worst shape in history under the current government,I'm 49yrs old and I worked for the MNR for 9yrs in the 80's and I thought things were bad then, but to be honest I never thought our fishery would end like this. Not only is our great lakes fishery privatly responsible for raising and stocking our streams the MNR is now putting a stop on our pen rearing releases. The fisherman of Lake Ontario raise and stock the salmon going into our lake, we want to pen the fish, the MNR has steped in and refused anymore Pens untill further study, which means screwed up no more pens.Even if we go on our own to improve our fisheries the MNR will put a cease order on it, you can't win, giving them more $$$ is not the answer they have to much power and not enough knowledge now . As to DrS,s is post you hit the nail on the head the current minister is out for a few tourist opertators, she's not the minister of natural resources but the minister of thanks for the $$$$$$$$$$,"

Being newly married and such it may be time to change your perspective, I hope you still keep your love for the outdoors the problem you have now your old job and working outdoors is going to haunt you always, I hope you come to grips with it, you'll never be happy again untill your working for the resources.Good luck welding......money good , life crap...keep trying  your passion money crap.. life great and that really is what it's all about."

539516,canadadude,2011-01-14 23:34:00,769,"I completly agree they take millions of dollars and lobby for nothing they have turned into the biggest scam in Ontario history. They in fact lobbied for the fishing licsense to enhance our fishery, once it was made it our fishery suffered. The OFAH is one of the biggest scams in the province, there a profit organisation, that has done little to nothing to improve fisheries.They say there the voice of the Ontario angler but I wonder at 2 million a year our voice is not heard. It's a scam they prey on our disgruntlness(new word maybe)but never do anything.....unless they get a government kickback. They sleep with the enemy the OFAH is a scam"
539530,Roy,2011-01-14 23:58:00,13728,"MHO is that OFAH is the only voice (of any consequence) that Ontario anglers and hunters have. If you cut them down, you'll be shooting yourself in the foot. Maybe work with them to bring positive ideas and results to the table?"
539540,chessy,2011-01-15 00:18:00,610,"i have tried that roy. and if it does not profit them they dont want it .. for instance this case is not fishing but hunting . the northumberland county forest was doing update on activities to be held on the land . one mayor ask the ofah to attend . the ofah said they would participate and there suggestion was that ever hunter have a ofah membership to hunt there . the commitee voted that down . then at the end the mayors of the county asked for a meeting and the ofah said they would be there , You guessed it no one showed . the mayor said if  ofah could not show up than hunting must not be a big deal and we lost hunting in certain areas. The mayor had emails from the ofah saying they would come . when they did not i asked why and they said they did not know about the meeting . when the documents were presented they said oh that meeting and said there was a family emergency . i could see that but not one other person could not show..... this is just one of many situations i have been involved with ."
539545,canadadude,2011-01-15 00:29:00,769,"The OFAH has lobbied the fishing & hunting comunity into think there the only voice we have, they have created a monopoly and such have used the ontario, hunters& fishers to line there pockets with $$$$$$$$.I do in fact relise the need for a voice but we should not keep fund a corupt organisation. The voice is not being herd although the OFAH says they are doing there best it's a scam. The OFAH lays down with government and other organisations continually they do not fight for the hunter's and fishers of the province, if a win for us takes place they take full credit when it's ussually a local club or organisation that made it happen.The OFAH is a freaking money grubbing scam they have nothing to lobby legislation in Ontario government,roll over on ontario tax payer legislation. As far as local legislation there no where to be seen, it's up to our local clubs to change minds, however if we do get a win the OFAH is all over it. There a scam and should be gone or in need of an overhall, I think GONE!!!!"
539546,canadadude,2011-01-15 00:31:00,769,EXACTLY....but they come to collect the $$$$$ the OFAH never misses the $$$$$$$
539561,canadadude,2011-01-15 01:08:00,769,"This is somthing that may open your eyes, When the ontario fishing licsence was lobbied for by the OFAH the intent was to enhance our fishery not to pay for the entire fishery. The MNR at the time relied on monies from the big pot, they were given a budget, well the OFAH said lets have a licsence to give more $$$$ to the fishery, hence the fishing liscence was established with the agreement the extra revenue would enhance the fishery. Since that big stupid mistake the government decided the MNR will be funded by liscence fees and no monies from the big pot will be given to the MNR. So instead of enhancing our fishery& hunting oportunities with province we in such shot our selves in the foot, we lost $$$ the fishing liscence was ment to enhance the province but they used the extra to fit the whole bill we lost big time. In fact we still loose because any hatchery of use to the province is privatly done by volunteers and local persons.  Now then my problem with the OFAH is they know as much as I do how the provinces fishery has been stollen from us anglers, they were in fact the one's who lobbied for the provincial fishing liscence. Yet since then they have never in fact riased a voice when the monies were taken from the budget, not a peep, they knew we were getting screwed from the start but still loobied for a liscence.They were a big player in getting a provincial liscence , they got the angler aproval at the time but they lied and scewed the us, and to this day they still use there monopoply for being a voice to screw the anglers/hunters of ontario.They sleep with enemy for $$$$$$"
539563,chilli,2011-01-15 01:14:00,199,What a load of dung dude. They throw that in the governments face every chance they get. That and the bear hunt. They call the government out on the broken promise because the government promised to match the funding raised by anglers dollar for dollar. The government reneged and the OFAH will not only never let them forget it but they lobby constantly for the province to restore funding and honour their side of that deal.  This isn't the only scenario where the government has done this to us. Think about where the licence plate sticker was supposed to go. Right back into the roads. Do you think all of our licence fees go back into the roads or the general pot?
539571,canadadude,2011-01-15 01:32:00,769,"Come on Dan, it's not a load of dung, they fall over to the government consistantly, they lost on the fishing liscence, again on the spring bear hunt, when are you going to relise the OFAH is just out for your $$$$$, they clain to lobby for the angler/hunter but give me a break they win the odd local battle just enough to keep it legitatment. There a scam they fund each other for guided deer hunts and phesent shooting on Pele island, not to mention there sweet camps up north. At one time the OFAH was a force they lost it when the provincial fishing liscence was established. They were bought out then and it's been a scam on every OFAH member since,they have not sucessully lobbied for anything since and in fact they have gave more of our rights to the government then they have protected"
534946,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-05 17:18:00,655,"Unfortunately, I don't believe that our Ontario Liberal government realizes or cares enough about the economic benefits that fishing brings to this Province. Many of the States have always been light years ahead of Ontario catering to anglers, and even many other Provinces cater to angling a lot more IMO.  In the States and other Provinces, they add many good launch ramp facilities to popular lakes and rivers, fish cleaning stations and access points with parking to rivers and creeks. In Ontario, good launch ramp facilities and fish cleaning stations are rare, and access points to rivers and creeks seem to be dissapearing quickly with all the building.  Fish rearing for Great Lakes tributaries in NY is tremendous compared to Ontario. This is very evident when you see rivers full of fish and anglers in NY compared to our tributaries in Ontario (this year was one of few good years). Some tribs in Ontario have good natural reproduction which is great, but the tribs that don't should be heavily stocked IMO.  It's a shame, because Ontario is a great place with so many angling opportunities. I would like to see improvements, wouldn't you?  My wife purchased a fishing licence at CTC early last year and didn't get her card until about November. Stuff like this shouldn't happen.  Don't take this post the wrong way, I am not bashing our OMNR. I think they are doing a good job considering the lack of funding and manpower they have. I believe that change will only happen if political candidates hear from a good number of anglers from Ontario.  We need to let the politicians hear our voice in the next Ontario Provincial election. The more voices that political candidates hear from anglers will help. Municipal elections should be treated the same way. Whenever I got a knock at the door during my last municipal election from political candidates, I took the time to speak to them about adding more access points to Bronte Creek and launch ramp facilities on Lake Ontario in Burlington. I am only one voice that can easily be brushed off though.  I believe that I can still do more and plan to, by drafting a letter and sending it to all future political candidates in the next election. Change for the better can happen with enough political pressure, and there is enough anglers here on OFC alone to make a difference.  Remember these points during the next political election campaign. I realize that most of us lead busy lives, but it will not take that much time to send a few letters and speak to political candadites that knock on our doors. Every bit helps.  - inject more funding into the OMNR (i.e. more Conservation Officers) - More public education/awareness (i.e. regulation changes or public awareness on differentiating species etc.) - Protect our watersheds - More/better launch ramp facilities - Fish cleaning stations at popular launch ramps - More/better access points to rivers and streams with parking and garbage cans  Sorry if this topic has been on here recently and I missed it.  Aaron"
534962,Terry,2011-01-05 18:37:00,14456,"I agree with you  however change cost money who is going to pay..taxes....triple the cost of our license    in many cases it local gov that controls boat ramps and parking and they are reducing them not increasing or maintaining them. the local home owners/cottagers want less traffic at their ramps or on their lakes and less garbage and the local gov listens to the voters.....   I guess if we can show/convince them that more fishing opportunities = more tax dollars, = more jobs and is good for local economy, we might get a gov to make some changes"
534963,GBW,2011-01-05 18:39:00,8460,"Aaron, you should get Cronzy on your show (now that he's called it quits) and talk to him about it too..."
534965,I'mHooked,2011-01-05 18:53:00,525,"Hey Aaron, you're ALMOST a guide! Only 10 more posts to go! You excited?  ...oh, and agree with what your thoughts."
534978,LeXXington,2011-01-05 19:33:00,1928,Easy change OCT 6th 2011..  Already budgeted for and ready. Call and ask all the candidates what they are going to fix the issue's.
534997,hammercarp,2011-01-05 20:18:00,964,John Q Publics and his politicians image of the average fisherman.  This why things won't change.
535006,BillM,2011-01-05 20:42:00,17367,Some of the rivers and streams are way to delicate for public access areas and big parking lots.  They get enough pressure as is.
535015,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-05 20:58:00,3761,"I agree with your statements, and honestly whats a extra $10 or 15 or 20 on our fishing license if it means we see garbage cans at our already ""fishing"" parking lot's. That dam causeway in Port Perry is first off disgusting and so are the people that make it this way. Things simple as the Conservation Authority running a truck by to take garbage cans would be good and would eliminate lot's I'm sure.  Another thing I can point out is a increase of CO's. To add another 10 or 20 guys out there would make a strong difference and yes there is a price to pay but whats the price if we don't have more enforcement....it's amazing how many people fish for sportfish and don't care or are not informed on the importance of respecting seasons and limits(myself included a few years back) As far as protect the rivers and sensitivity I'm all for that, however if there is a small 4-12car parking lot there, throw down some new gravel and a few tin cans for garbage to jazz up our spots.  We don't need to change much, just adapt to the new and ever growing fishery with simple but effective ways to keep out populations up, our garbage and pollution down.  I can only imagine how many bags of garbage I will fill picking up trash around a few spots I fish close to home.  Aaron good post bud."
535019,justin elia,2011-01-05 21:01:00,151,"When you look at the NYDEC fisheries budget, it dwarfs ours.  No wonder every ditch gets choked with stockers.  Im sure if the MNR had the money NY does to put into its fisheries, we would have the same opportunities.  Its simply comes down to money.  My advice would be to do as Aaron mentioned or lend a hand with a conservation group to seriously make a difference."
535054,kickingfrog,2011-01-05 22:38:00,8333,"All levels of government, and flavours, do not put enough emphasize on the environment. Some of the reasons for this are: The difficultly in quantifying and qualifying the value of return on investment. The length of time, and money, needed to properly observe and evaluate the results of environmentally initiatives, or the lack of. And our general lack of interest in paying for it via taxes, user fees, pulling tax $ from elsewhere, etc.  Even if the environment is a priority for one flavour can't be properly managed on 3, 4 or 5 year mandates. It needs to be near the top of the list, ALL the time and for every flavour of government.  The quotes goes: In a democracy you always get the government you deserve. The voters (that's us) need to make our feelings known, and then hold the governments responsible."
535058,kickingfrog,2011-01-05 22:47:00,8333, NY state's population is about twice as much as Ontario. That bigger tax base is used on a land mass that is a small fraction of Ontario. I am all for doing more for the environment (see my post above) but its hard to make an apples to  big apples comparison sometimes.
535061,bigugli,2011-01-05 22:54:00,6138,"Canadians like to talk change but won't foot the bill or the consequences.  That is why we allow ourselves to be lied to every election. Every election promises are made, and after every election the same limp excuses of ""priorities"", "" no money left in the budget"", ""poor economic times"", ""change of political climate"",...... Don't get me wrong. I'm no better. In fact I'm worse. I used to write the campaign dribble you were being fed during some elections."
535070,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-05 23:14:00,2582,I think they hear our voices just fine. The problem is there are other voices out there that represent more of the population so they hear them MUCH BETTER. And IMO this will never change.
535126,POLLIWOGG,2011-01-06 00:38:00,835,"Make fishing legal!  Drop the resident fishing license, save the wasted $ given to foreign private co.  to administer the license and free up the co's from being meter maids so they can do the real co work they want to do. Support the mnr through general rev. and save the administration and enforcement cost of licensing. If Ontario's natural resources are available to be used by everyone they should be supported by everyone."
535177,vinnimon,2011-01-06 02:04:00,2593,"I agree with you aaron, totally. I asked a few of the same questions to a friends father, way back( a biologist). The centre for inland waters is right here! A ramp and a cleaning station would be great for their studies, on their side for public use."
535253,Garry2Rs,2011-01-06 03:27:00,1425,"Two points... It is a mistake to involve government in anything you don't want screwed up! Governments first job is self perpetuation.  Therefore they like to create committees, who then appoint officials and hire staff.  The staff do studies, which they sent to the committees to study.  New committees will be formed to study the studies and report back to the committee.  Since those people who oppose any use of the outdoors or don't want you on ""their"" river, lake or shore, are better connected and more politically savvy than you, these studies will be heavily influenced by people who don't want what you do.  If you want it done, be prepared to do it yourself. Join or form an organization.  Collect private money to do these improvements.  Speak to the lowest possible level of local government about donating your cash, time and labour to accomplish your goals.  The closer you get to the grass roots, the more likely you are to find folks like yourselves."
535283,mercman,2011-01-06 03:59:00,7054,"  things wont change,because in the general population,we are a minority, and minorities get the crappy end of the stick."

535330,outllaw,2011-01-06 11:31:00,1232,"HI not to be negative, Sportfishing is down near 50 per-cent, along with boating.. back in the 1980 period the federal goverment put forth grat money for municipaltys for breakwalls, ramps and marinas. they now sit well under capacity. lost revenue from vacant boatwells. the mnr stance is to attempt to maintain not enhance the fisheries. the age old argument of lost opportunitys , will fall upon deaf ears. goverments after being downloaded upon from ottawa are cash strapped. lost jobs, no growth equal maintaing whats there at best. if you want ramps, parking areas they need to be maintained. citys and townships have to earmark tax dollars for these projects.. i live in southern ontario and have witnessed countless closures of marinas and sports good stores.  my only postive things i see that have a viable outcome is to lobby and maintain whats available now. sportsfishing is in damage control."
535342,Billy Bob,2011-01-06 12:39:00,5865,"Our NYS DEC said you can't raise walleyes above the fry stage because Blah blah blah....well a private club did it ""The Niagara River Association"" and it's been a huge success for many years. Bottom line they (DEC) were geared for stocking salmon and trout and have only one walleye hatchery on Oneida Lake....total expenses were (a few years ago) $30,000.00 TOTAL...and 85% of those walleye FRY went back into Oneida Lake where only 1% survived as per there info...  Everytime I went to the French River I was stopped and asked by biologist for scale samples and they would ask many questions....at the time I thought I was helping out the fishery there...but after a while I started to tell them NO, sorry, I'm fishing right now..(the bite only last so long and I don't need to waste time and the big bucks I was spending to fish there answering a survey every time)........so how did all that scale sampling and survey questions work out...last I heard the French is much worse now then 25 years ago...  We have biologist here in NYS that ask you those same questions at the boat ramp while I'm tying down my boat and it's only one person, not 3 in a boat. Does this help....yes, some political connected young man has a gravy job for the year...that's how it helps (him).  Water access is what we need here, especially on Lake Erie where there are NO free access points to launch at even though we bought the land and put in the launch on Catturagus Creek through our license money...  ...the DEC bigs that launch out to a private contractor who charges the going rate.....go figure....again watch what you wish for !  !  !  We have many gun clubs and fishing clubs here and most belong to a Federation and put political pressure on our DEC and elected officials that way...we do see some good things because of that. I would be surprised if your cottage/fish camp industry doesn't have a similar organization to pressure your politicians and fish and game department. But it seem like a lot of these older fishing camps are now targeting the family vacation crowd, not the dirty old fishermen like us...  Again, like Garry2rs said....do it yourself or it wouldn't get done or wouldn't get done right. Money talks old smelly fishermen walks...  Good Luck, Bob"
535429,OhioFisherman,2011-01-06 17:22:00,6623,"It takes money to do anything? Like some one mentioned New York`s population is almost 1/3 of all of Canada`s? While it may seen very important to locals there is a whole nation`s, whole province`s fisheries to fund? Even Ohio with roughly 1/9 the land area has a relatively similar population, and far less water related issues to fund.  I inquired some years ago about buying a home on a lake in New York, just a small bungalow, but lakefront property, which made it a luxury subject to a 25% tax on the purchase price. The postage stamp property, maybe 50x120 carried a property tax burden of over 5500.00 a year in property taxes.  Ohio passed state taxes to acquire land for parks and such, some lakefront. Some local communities have also realized the added value of sport fishing and boating minded tourism and acquired land on their own through local taxes."
535430,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-06 17:26:00,655,"Well, I figured this topic may become controvercial and have some negative feedback. I can understand why many people feel that no matter what we do it will not make a difference. The government does not have the best track record at times.  The bottom line is, we are a special interest group, and not a small one. I feel that we are a large enough special interest group that lobbying the government can make a difference. Other special interest groups lobby the government successfully all the time. Even a bunch of small improvements for anglers annually can be a victory for us. We shouldn't expect everything to be solved overnight and be all better with a few letters. We are not asking the government to do the impossible, just continue to make improvements for anglers and let them hear our voice.  We live in a democratic society that allows free speech and lobbying our government. Why not utilize the tools we were given to try and help make our passion in life even better.  What do we really have to loose? A small amount of our time to send a few letters may put our sport in the spotlight in Ottawa a little more, create more awareness and add political pressure to make improvements. Remember the old saying ""the squeeky wheel gets the greese""?  I believe that we can help make a difference if we all work together. There is another old saying ""united we stand tall, divided we fall"". I don't want to just sit and watch further degradation of our great sport. I really love fishing in Ontario and would like to see improvements. Don't we all?  Who knows, if there are improvements to fishing in Ontario and more public awareness, it just may get more people into our great pastime and grow. Growth for our sport would be a good thing.  I can spend the time to draft a letter and post it here, but we need real support from anglers in order to make this work. One squeeky wheel 100 miles from Ottawa will not be heard.  Aaron"
535432,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-06 17:36:00,655,"We live in the wealthiest Province in Canada, our government has the money. They just need to spend it wisely and adjust their budget to the voters' best interest."
