539125,bassnass,2011-01-14 01:54:00,174,... I'm afraid to ask.
539139,mercman,2011-01-14 02:29:00,7054,yup............thats the funniest picture i've seen so far in here.You should enter it in the Funniest Icefishing Photo contest i saw in here somewhere Still gives me a chuckle when i see it.
539570,bassnass,2011-01-15 01:29:00,174,lol
539685,I'mHooked,2011-01-15 12:35:00,525," Your English teacher wouldn't be happy.   It's an incomplete sentence.  ""I love satin panties...on my wife/girlfriend when I walk in the door""  That's kinda what you meant...right?"
540064,bassnass,2011-01-16 16:14:00,174,"I'm confused.  You want your girl to wait for me in satin gitch?  I mean, I'm not gonna say no... but...  End mi Enlesh is juzt fin thanx."
540125,I'mHooked,2011-01-16 18:51:00,525,"Was trying to help dig you out of a hole after you said you like satin panties!   If you completed your sentence as noted, it wouldn't have come across as anything other than normal heterosexual manliness.  I was beginning to think you love wearing them!"
540417,bassnass,2011-01-17 13:42:00,174,SMoooth & supportive!
537942,bassnass,2011-01-11 14:47:00,174,                      The End --LincolnG Ps Censorship sucks!
537944,Headhunter,2011-01-11 14:52:00,5703,"A pixel is a terrible thing to waste! LMAO Looks like you guys had a great time! Maybe next trip, try and take some pics! LMAO HH"
537946,Nipfisher,2011-01-11 14:56:00,2449,"Good report Lincoln...I think it is finished now. How many eyes were caught for the trip and how many slot sizers? Did you get many ""cigar"" eyes? Only 50 fish...or 50 walleye? You have like 100 pictures of fish.  That aside..thank you for puting up such a great post. It is like I was there on the trip with you (I can actually smell the farts) lol."
537951,Roy,2011-01-11 15:02:00,13728,Well that was short...where's part 8?
537955,bassnass,2011-01-11 15:14:00,174,"Honestly, I never feel like I take enough pix when I'm fishin'.  Fishing usually wins out.  Really, we only had one cigareye - the rest of the pickereyes were just below the slot or right in there.  We caught quite a few walters - probably 20-30.  I think we were 53 'countable' fish on the trip - a few walleye under 10"", few more perch under 8"", and the rockbass didn't get counted.  Poor shunned little species.  Part 8 will be a fishporn montage of the trouts from this past fall/winter."
537959,mercman,2011-01-11 15:18:00,7054,"You sure tell a mean story in Pics !  Looks like you guys has an AWESOME trip .Thanks for the great pics.  PS, who's the one in the spiderman panties !!!!!"
537988,Gregoire,2011-01-11 16:25:00,1397,Thanks for the report and the abundant pics. A solid time wasting read.
537996,I'mHooked,2011-01-11 16:49:00,525,"Wow, looks like a fun trip!  Mmmmm....fried breaded protien!!!   Looks good! (probably contributed to a little increase in greenhouse gas emmissions   )  If you scroll through the 20-30 pictures of the guy drinking the Gingerale real quick, it looks like a little movie!  Nice that you got into some swimmers too.  Man, if that isn't the life...being able to lay in bed reading OOD, havin a drink and Whamo, fish on!"
538054,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-11 19:23:00,2690,"Great ""little"" re-cap,   Definitely looks like a great time was had + some decent ""walter"" fishing as well.  Have heard nothing but, good things about Rob's outfit."
538092,ctdd2006,2011-01-11 21:19:00,531,great trip and recap!  CHEERS!
538127,stubbex1,2011-01-11 22:03:00,164,"wow great report!  The lack of pictures however leaves alot to the imagination  I've been reading up on these bungalow ice fishing trips, they look like they are a blast!"
538129,bigugli,2011-01-11 22:06:00,6138,"Looks like you guys had a great trip. Fun, friends, food, rerfreshments and lots pf fish to boot. Lying in bed catching fish sure sounds sweet."
538130,alphaalpha,2011-01-11 22:09:00,475,Thanks for taking the time and effort to post a great report!  looks like you had an awesome time and congrats on the big fish honors!
538161,irishfield,2011-01-11 23:03:00,26272,Thanks Lincoln... looked like a GREAT time. Next time try to remember it all would ya...  FYI for next time... as I know how long that took to put together... Do your whole report in Word.. enter it into the post new thread upload box.. hit preview. It will show you how many pics will come up and then cut the rest off.. so you cut it off there.. copy the remaining overload and then delete it from the box.. paste that into a reply post box.. preview again.. see what it cuts off.. copy and cut the extra.. post... repeat and you can usually get them all in before anyone replies to put the thread all in one place.
538177,bassnass,2011-01-11 23:38:00,174,"Thanks, Irish - much appreciated.  I did put the thing together in Word - but just ""eye-balled"" how much would fit into a post -- the preview would be good to know 'zactly how much will fly.  Cheers, again - & I hope your daughter's gettin' fat! (That normally wouldn't sound like a good thing, would it? lol)  All the BEST for 2011!"
