526557,aniceguy,2010-12-08 21:15:00,1094,pentax optio w90 is pretty much the best waterproof camera out there.  I bought one it didnt suit the needs I wanted it for so I have it for sale

526561,irishfield,2010-12-08 21:25:00,26272,Even more of a bonus if they float!
526563,Chrispy,2010-12-08 21:31:00,168,I got the Fuji FinePix....the one that Dave Mercer is sponsored by....works great!!  And right around your price point...they make a better one now that you can take with you ice fishing and not worry about it freezing either....mine has been all over the islands and in the swamps of Florida.....No problems and good pics!!   Chrispy!
526568,bare foot wader,2010-12-08 21:46:00,1354,"there was a great, long thread about this a month or so back...try searching for it, lots of good info there  my next one will be sony or panasonic but pretty much all the big manufacturers have a waterproof model, all in about the 200-400 mark, all pretty comparable....pentax and olympus both have good models as well"
526569,Kanuck,2010-12-08 21:56:00,13,"I researched as as well..  took Canon D10  to mexico.  Salt water ,under water video with the stingrays,beautiful!! Bought the floating wrist strap as well,really didnt need it to float but made easier to keep on wrist. Also lots of pics around tropical fish coral etc, fantastic. Cant go wrong ! Cheers"
526573,scugpg,2010-12-08 22:07:00,1373, The Sony TX5 is a great camera if you're not going 10ft or deeper. Super compact as well with touch screen. http://sonystyle.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=20153&catalogId=100803&langId=200&productId=8198552921666122654

If you're a simple point and clicker this will work great for you. The timer is nice as you can position the camera, push the shutter and you've got 10 seconds to pose with the fish (but this doesn't always work well on bright days)."

526665,timmeh,2010-12-09 01:47:00,609," If you've got the money you can definitely do better than the fuji (but it's good for $150 or so). At work I have an olympus tough, not sure of the exact model, and it's good too."

526768,squiggs,2010-12-09 14:04:00,10,"I have the pentax optio W90 and highly recommend it. Very quick on start up, all the usual features of any point & shoot, built in macro lights, comfortable in the hand and fits well in any pocket. The only downfall I have found is that the view screen glass will get scratched as it sits proud of the rear surface of the camera. Avoid the Olympus, terribly slow on start up. Canon was a close second but it is very bulky. Fuji seemed cheap to me, my brother in law has one, I don't know how he's making out with it. Cheers"

I love NCIX, always have some sale going on specifically when I'm looking for a product. Bought a pair of Koss Portapros for $30 off. Anyways, just a heads up to those who are interested in a cam, I'm still going for the TS2, which is about $14 more expensive, but the D10 is too bulky."

For underwater, they work great down to 33 feet, which is good for snorkelling. I would much prefer canon over Olympus and the SD memory would have been comparable with my other Canon equip. Olympus uses XD with an adapter to Micro SD."

540752,Jet,2011-01-18 03:22:00,364,This is definitely a case of getting what you pay for. The panasonic is one of the priciest (used to be $400) but has won most every comparison for a reason. I bought one mostly because it takes the best videos so when I hook that fish of a lifetime it will look great.
