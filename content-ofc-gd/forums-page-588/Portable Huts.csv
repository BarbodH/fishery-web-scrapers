540165,Terry,2011-01-16 21:20:00,14456,"his hut was so hot I couldn't sand too close to the window to talk to him, started melting my clothes but man is it a nice hut"
540167,irishfield,2011-01-16 21:21:00,26272,You guys walk or sled out there?
540171,Terry,2011-01-16 21:33:00,14456,zoom zoom  no walking
540176,tb4me,2011-01-16 21:55:00,3295,"ha this brings back memories from. Fishing with Vince and Hooknlip on LPB before Xmas. We rented the ""cube pop out""  and had to set it up in a 25kmh wind....lol.. At least the wind was blowing towards shore.Never did have it blow away thou. once setup and iced in it was a diecent hut..No floor though. Made for cold feet after 6 or so hours."
540178,Big Cliff,2011-01-16 21:56:00,6899,"Well, my SubZero might be hard to set up in the wind but after reading some of the tips on how to, I can't see it being much of a problem, anchor the corners before you try to expand it. It is light, roomy, and comfortable with a small heater in it.  Some of the flip overs I have fished out of I found were very small and I found the seats hard to get up out of because you are sitting so low (and I am old).  If you are not sure which way to go then try fishing out of both for a day then make your decision.  For me, portability and comfort were big issues, being able to stand up in it to stretch was a bonus."
540185,Big Cliff,2011-01-16 21:59:00,6899, A friend mentioned using one of those roll up imitation bambo mats on the ice and that that made a huge difference for keeping your feet warm. They don't absorbe water and they are light and easy to transport.
540361,SlowPoke,2011-01-17 04:02:00,2984,"LOL!!! Don't look inside, you might find a few 8"" holes through the floor and some dull blades on your auger."
540373,toca,2011-01-17 07:40:00,274,too lazy to lug around a heavy suitcase
540412,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-17 13:19:00,2690," Love mine, too.  The only drawback is if two guys the size of Brian and I were in it with fishfinder, heater, etc...it gets a bit cramped. The set-up/stability/transportability are great!"
540036,SlowPoke,2011-01-16 15:31:00,2984,"A recent trip to the fishing store with jjcanoe and scugog has me wondering. I'm not on the market for one (yet) and I can see the advantages for both. If someone DID NOT have an ATV or Snowmobile, which design would you recommend and why?  Pop-up   Flip-over    I'm still open minded on this but I'm leaning towards the pop-up design. - will fit in any vehicle - easy for storage - quick to deploy and take down - versitile (leave it in the car year 'round for shelter instead of van camping  ) - back pack it, toss it in a sled for walking out or leave it in your car to drive out"
540038,Grimace,2011-01-16 15:34:00,2020,I have a 2 man flip up.  I would not want to drag it around without a sled.
540041,Jer,2011-01-16 15:39:00,1426,"Without a sled or ATV, go for the pop-up. For all the reasons you already mentioned."
540043,Sinker,2011-01-16 15:44:00,8692,"I voted flip before reading the actual question.  Now that I've read it, I think a pop up is your answer.  I have a one man flip which is great for one guy walking. I can put all my gear in it, and away I go. I get to my spot and flip it over my hole, and bobs your uncle. If I want to move, everything is already packed in the sleigh, just flip the tent and I'm gone again. No muss, no fuss. Very quick, easy, and effective.  A two man is a whole different story though. Two guys, with all thier gear in a two man flip........you need a machine to haul it. I got rid of a two man for just that reason. More of a PITA than anything, I hardly used it.  S."
540044,BFSC Kevin,2011-01-16 15:44:00,1351,"pop out pros -small so it can fit into almost any vehicle (my 3 man eskimo can fit into my 2 seater car) -lightweight -cheaper to buy -you can stand up in it -lots of room for you and gear if you go solo with it   cons -you need to set it up/ take down. Taking down takes a minute and packing it back into the bag takes two. -once you set up, it seems to be a hassle to re position -how durable are the rods/nodes/flex points? with it popping in and out all the time?   flip over pros -its on a sled -just need to flip over the top and you're ready to fish -small area, can be pro or con, but it will be easier to keep warm/heated in there  cons -you better make sure it can fit in your vehicle (my clam fish trap scout can only fit into a SUV, truck or hatch, no regular cars  ) -heavier -higher purchase price  If you are going with people, I'd say pop up. If you are going solo, I'd say flip over so you can do more exploring.  edit: btw  I'm on foot too."
540046,misfish,2011-01-16 15:46:00,29133,"Brian Like I stated in another thread. If I had looked closer at the pop ups,Wayne would still have this flip I got off of him.  My next purchase will be the pop up. Easier on the back. Will still need a small bog for the extras,but that will be easy to pull."
540047,splashhopper,2011-01-16 15:48:00,2931,"hmmm..... that van camping seems to be the deal breaker for me, but then again, I like to move around  when I am fishing, so maybe the flip over is for me.  We shall see, Dutchy just bought a pop up and we are anxious to take it out soon."
540050,scugpg,2011-01-16 15:53:00,1373,"SlowPoke haha nice to see this thread. A pop-up was really tempting for me yesterday but I think I've decided on a 1.5 man or a light 2 man flip-over as the way to go....2 man will have to wait until a new vehicle though....unless I can find a small utility trailer  I fish mostly small ponds and lakes that have no quads/sleds allowed and like to move around, so I see moving the Flip-over to the next spot much easier. That and the pop-up looks to me a pain to setup in the wind!  I think you could pull the 2 man pretty easily if it was outfitted with sliders or even skis.  I really like the look of the Shappell rover 1.5sp http://www.shappell.com/rover15spshelter.html"
540053,bigugli,2011-01-16 15:59:00,6138,"Have to admit I'm liking my flip up, but there has to be someone with me to lift it in and out of the van. Cube just has so much more work to using it if you like being mobile. It's a real PITA to handle in high winds. I've seen a few go airborne the past couple of years."
540054,BFSC Kevin,2011-01-16 15:59:00,1351,"I pulled a 2 man clam nanook with someone, with his gear, my gear and gas auger.....Very little walking to the spot... I was about to pass out We're young dudes too, in the 20s."
540055,BFSC Kevin,2011-01-16 16:01:00,1351,  I tried re-positioning my pop up during 15-20k winds. It was a parachute! My friend had to come over and hold it down in order for me to anchor it down.
540056,scugpg,2011-01-16 16:01:00,1373, ugli what one do you have? The wind thing and mobility is a big deterrent. I don't need a shelter if it's not windy out 95% of the time
540061,BFSC Kevin,2011-01-16 16:12:00,1351,"  True- when it is not windy out, you don't need one but it is nice to shield your eyes from the bright sun/snow. Also with a hut, if the water clarity permits, you can even see the fish!"
540094,tb4me,2011-01-16 17:08:00,3295,you can build one thats very solid and light! all for under 75 bux.. check it out here..Its best for the cheap guys like me! Going to build one this week...! http://waterandwoods.net/2009/01/build-a-portable-ice-shelter/all/1/
540102,irishfield,2011-01-16 17:43:00,26272,Flip over... about 75% of the time that I have ice fished in the last 6 years you would have been Mary Poppins trying to set up one of those Tents before you'd even got it screwed down..
540114,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-16 18:24:00,10439,"I have one of each. A 3 man (better for 2) pop up and a Frabill Trekker II. I use the pop up early in the season when I have to walk on and switch to the flip over when the ice gets safe for snowmobile travel. My buddy nad I hauled out my flip over by hand and it was a hell of a lot of work. If travelling on foot I would not suggest a flip over, even a light one like the Trekker II. IMHO"
540116,bigugli,2011-01-16 18:24:00,6138,"My son got me the HT Magnum 2 man for Christmas. Very roomy, but it is bulky and does weigh 80 lbs, hence the difficulty sliding it in and out of the mini van."
540129,Fish Farmer,2011-01-16 19:14:00,2234,"Agree 100 o/o on clear ice no problem but ice with snow forget it, maybe if your a Young buck but add a few years, Dead Man Walking.  I f I had to do it over, I'd go with the Clam Scout 1 man. I have the 2 man Guide and I would trade in a min."
540131,scugpg,2011-01-16 19:20:00,1373,Are there any large 1 mans out there other than the shappell rover 1.5
540133,vinnimon,2011-01-16 19:35:00,2593,"I have a clam 2000 hut, and very happy with it. Quicker setting it up, than a cube pop out and flyaway parachute hut."
540144,Terry,2011-01-16 20:27:00,14456,flip up for me but if I do much more walking I might have to get a small pop up I am just toooooooooo old to pull that 2 man flip up all over the place
540145,irishfield,2011-01-16 20:30:00,26272,That was a short day...
540158,Rizzo,2011-01-16 21:07:00,4754,you can take these things fishing? Mine is mainly a fort in the basement for the kids
540160,Terry,2011-01-16 21:10:00,14456, up at 4 50 back home at 330  that long enough...pulling the camera cable up to move to another spot my hands got real cold and I never really got them warm again so I left  whitefish would have warmed me up..but they would help today
540162,irishfield,2011-01-16 21:17:00,26272,What.. Lloyd didn't have a 30*C hut that you could go in for a bit?
