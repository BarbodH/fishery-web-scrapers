540319,KelfuN,2011-01-17 02:46:00,246,"Hey guys, was wondering if anyone here are familiar with Humminbird sonars..  I was on the ice today and all of a sudden the sonar goes blank, so i gave it a reboot. After it has rebooted it gave me ""transducer not connected"" and goes right to demo mode. Ever since then I couldn't get it back to normal! Could it be a defective transducer? I just picked up this unit last month and it would really be a pain in the rear end if I had to send it out for repairs already  Thanks!"
540331,irishfield,2011-01-17 03:09:00,26272,Sounds like a broken wire to the trans.. hopefully someone close has one you can hook up and test to see if it's that simple.
540409,Woodsman,2011-01-17 13:14:00,1286,"Just about any 83/200 kHz transducer from Humminbird will fit, it as most units use the same transducer. Borrow one if you can & if it works then you know it's your transducer."

540457,KelfuN,2011-01-17 15:44:00,246," Thanks for the offer! Im just going back to where I bought it and see what they'll do for me.  Vic, your 585 ducer doesn't fit mine?"
540461,Victor,2011-01-17 15:50:00,1609," I got the 587, No it doesn't, mine is far more superior   haha.  You're also welcome to try mine if you happen to pass by where I live/work."
540635,Woodsman,2011-01-17 23:32:00,1286,"Your right your 345 is only a single 200 kHz beam & the dual beam is not the transducer you need. As for ""Im just going back to where I bought it and see what they'll do for me""  I hope it works for you but don't hold your breath. Your manual should state: PLEASE DO NOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT TO STORE FOR SERVICE Call: 1-800-633-1468 or www.humminbird.com  & click Support Although I have never required to go this route I've heard they will give you a North bay # to call. All reports I've seen are that North Bay # will look after you quite well."
540645,Victor,2011-01-17 23:52:00,1609," Hummingbird 345c  Woodsman, it should be a dual beam model."
540741,KelfuN,2011-01-18 03:06:00,246,Thanks for all the advices guys..  I found out it was the transducer giving me the problem. I called the Humminbird Service Center at North Bay and they are going to mail me a new transducer for free of charge.
