There's always a pessure crack at the point and it may look safe until you walk on it. Hopefully this day of warmth will help melt some of the snow in order to make some good ice from here on in. It hasnt been a good year so far for making ice no matter what you have heard from other people. It's not worth risking your life for herring or smelt...."
