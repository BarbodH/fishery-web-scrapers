540732,sticky,2011-01-18 02:49:00,33,I was wondering if anybody knew of some great spots or websites of ice fishing info for the kawarthas. Want to go there but I would need a hut and accommodation and don't know where to get the info
540751,Michael_Brown,2011-01-18 03:20:00,411,Here is a post with some Rice Lake info.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=49004  The perch bite has been great on Rice Lake lately with good numbers of 10-13 fish.

541032,Big Cliff,2011-01-18 22:00:00,6899, I went to that board about a year ago. I won't go into details but I wouldn't go back if there wern't any other boards. Just be careful what you post or PM anyone. PMs are not private if you are the moderator. Funny how some private information suddenly became common knowledge! I'm not accusing anyone of anything but it sure seemed like a strange coincidnce!
