See my roe bag snagged on the twig just in front of her?  Yeah.  Humpy male I lost at the net, then again out of the net – nearly scooped him after he came off and was swimmin’ away.  Beautiful!   Re-enacting the breading that would be this little guys fate  Pretty purple poisson!       Close one!  This old fella was bustin the ice off the pool he wanted to fish and found this one frozen into the anchor ice!  He spent a lil TLC on it.    Yup.  Creek’s a lil durrty today.  (I still managed to scrape up a couple of fish this day ;] )   The bag-poppers are pretty.       This big girl was loose – a fall spawner, I guess!      Almost pan-worthy.     One of several fish I encountered this day that was ASLEEP.  Water was low and clear.  I almost could have hand-landed this fish.  There were others I got my hand right around their caudal peduncles before they woke up.   Fishing was not great, this day. Lol      "
