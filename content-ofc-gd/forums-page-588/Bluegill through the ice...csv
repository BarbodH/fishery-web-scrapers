540607,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-17 22:28:00,2050,"For the past three years Averie and I have enjoyed what I consider one of the best bluegill fisheries you can find in Ontario.  From ice-out to ice-up we absolutely hammer on these 8 to 12 inch aggressive, hard fighting (for their size) tasty little fish, and occasionally get into some good crappie and rock bass that are mixed in the school as well.                  Up until now, we've spent most of our ice fishing targeting perch either on Longpoint Bay, or on our local pond in 25+ FOW.  If we can't get the perch to bite, I usually take her to her Goby hole just to keep her interested in the sport.              Now, after having a tough perch bite yesterday, I've decided I'd like to do some exploring and see if we can find some of our bluegill during the hardwater season.  I'm sure if we were able to dial them in like we can in the summer we'd have an ice fishing heaven right on our doorstep!  So my question is, during the winter of course.... Where, When and Why?  I've got the baits covered, just need to find the fish!  Cheers, Ryan & Averie"

540643,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-17 23:51:00,1107,I still think the majority go back into the deeper inlets closer to there spawning areas but I cantch seem to catch the darn things anytime so I could be totally wrong LOL
