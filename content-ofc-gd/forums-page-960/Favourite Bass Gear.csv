I'm doing a little research poll here for something I'm working on, please select all that apply  What is your favourite lure(s) to use for bass, and your favourite rod(s) to fish them with.  My favourite overall bait is the zoom superfluke, I fish it on a 6'6MH Johnny Morris Spinning Rod."
253606,bucktail,2008-09-29 16:42:00,1857,I got a 7 foot medium Loomis Crankbait rod this year and it is awesome. My hookup percentage on cranks is way up with its slower action!
253609,eyefish,2008-09-29 16:48:00,135,Long live the Jig...fished on a 7 foot heavy shimano crucial!
253614,ecmilley,2008-09-29 16:58:00,2163,"hmm so many choices, I guess right now my favorite set-up is a 7'2 carrot stix drop shot rod, but when I am in the thick of it I have a quantum pro-tour flippin stick that's awesome with worms and pigs and a chronarch reel, my favorite tube rod is a 6'3 morrum rod (have to upgrade that soon though) and a couple st.croix premier that i use for spinner baits in the 6.6 mh.... i can go on but it's way to hard to make a choice on favorite stuff it's all good"
253675,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-29 19:06:00,3761,"I use my Yum Dingers for under water and my Fishing Snakes for top water, the best strikes are on the snakes, you need to see it to beleive it!"
253899,singingdog,2008-09-30 10:15:00,1047,"I answered 'favourite' as opposed to 'most productive'. I know I can catch fish on a senko most of the time, but my favourite is a wake-bait. The hits are great, and it seems to be a big fish magnet....very few dinks hit that thing."
253924,Wild,2008-09-30 12:42:00,704,While not overly popular fly and ultralight rods were left out. Have to love the thrill of  topwater hits.
