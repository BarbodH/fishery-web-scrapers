251226,Leecher,2008-09-19 18:28:00,7832,"Two of my favorite guitarist are Alex Lifeson from Rush  Here an excerp of the Hemispheres Album, La Villa Strangiato song:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQYOfMuPHug  and Kim Mitchell   from Max Webster which I was fortunate to see live at the Civic Center in Ottawa a while back on his Universal Juvenile tour:  Here a video of the Original Max Webster Reunion - The Party song    Leechman"
251307,perodimi,2008-09-20 00:32:00,124,"Hi Leechman,  Just a little Rush trivia if you're a Lifeson fan. In the early eighties, I was working as a dispatcher and learning to fly at Buttonville Airport in Markham Ont. and Alex was also learning to fly so I got to know him fairly well. The song ""YYZ"" was inspired by the morse code for the same;  Y = -.-- and Z = --..  In those days, we used to have to positively identify the radio beacons or in this case, the Toronto VOR (YYZ VOR) by audio transmision. (Now our instruments are digitally identified). While Alex was airborne during a lesson getting his instrument rating, he was inspired by this identifier as the introduction beat to the song ""YYZ"":  _ . _ _    _ . _ _   _ _ . .  Next time you listen to the song you'll see what I mean.  This would have been around the time ""Permanent Waves"" came out. If I remember correctly, he mentions his instructor on the next album ""Moving Pictures"" where ""YYZ"" first appeared. I met Geddy a few times but he didn't care for flying. Alex was a wonderfully friendly guy and by the way, that's just his show name...  Peter"
251401,Leecher,2008-09-20 17:46:00,7832," Hi Peter,  That's a very good question but you got me on that one    Cool that you gotten to know him and met Geddy  Back in my younger days as a teen, I had a getto blaster that I would bring with me everywhere I went and play the rush songs that I had recorded on tape......aaahhhhhh the good old days  Next time I listen to that song, I will pay more attention  Jacques aka Leechman"
253218,Greencoachdog,2008-09-28 14:37:00,8163,This is what Rednecks like to listen to: 
253241,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-28 16:50:00,241," Who you callin' a redneck?! I absolutely love David Gilmour, but I've got to say, I prefer Jeff Beck. The guy is just phenomenal.  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Z92YPKtzHr0&...feature=related"
253335,CLofchik,2008-09-28 22:40:00,854," Why oh why can't we get Jon Bon Jovi on a helicopter..........c'mon get in Jon.....yeah yeah there's a hairdresser in there, really, now get in......   Heh, anybody hear of Funtwo? http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=QjA5faZF1A8   Lol this guy is pretty fun too  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM"
253374,holdfast,2008-09-29 00:30:00,1813,Jeff Beck is good but for smoothness take this 
253507,blaque,2008-09-29 12:16:00,2419," Thanks for that Holdfast.......that was an AMAZING video, now THAT..........is a stage show worth paying for.  Thats what ya call giving your fans their moneys worth!!!"
253510,BITEME,2008-09-29 12:25:00,1969," The show was absolutely phenominal, I doubt in my lifetime anyone will even be able to come close to it and to boot it was the most elaborate stage pink floyd ever produced(even the wall) SONIC AND VISUAL MASTERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
253515,holdfast,2008-09-29 12:49:00,1813,"As you know I got this from U-tube which is a copy of either the concert PULSE or the DVD.  IF you Like music, 5.1 stereo you must get this DVD.  By far my favorite out of my collection.  Just awesome sound and theatrics.  Probably one of the best Fidelity DVDs out there for your Home Theatre.  Id love to see this on Blueray.  As far as Im concern What he is holding is David Gimour.  He is the Guitar.  doesn't need a Jumpsuit, Look like hes in pain or make the feminine rock star poses."
253539,Headhunter,2008-09-29 13:50:00,5703,"Very nice example of some of the best players there are! Now, as a bass player, I have a bit of a different on this"" There can be only one! Ladies and gentlemen, I give you.... THE OX!  HH"
253547,BITEME,2008-09-29 14:18:00,1969,LONG LIVE THE OX!!!!!!!!!   Notable mention   Geezer Butler Lemmy Steve Harris Geddy Lee

250505,ccmtcanada,2008-09-17 15:16:00,7971,AWESOME version of this classic tune.  Jeff Healy did a pretty good job on one as well....
250510,Roy,2008-09-17 15:54:00,13728,"Anytime Albert Lee is involved in something, there's a good chance you'll have a winner."
250539,kentooley,2008-09-17 17:18:00,208,"Wow!! A George Harrison classic!! I remember seeing that tribute show and I got goosebumps again. For you younger guys, that was his son in  white. Pretty cool!!  Thanx man!!"
250587,Terry,2008-09-17 20:50:00,14456,very cool when and where did you go to see them live
250589,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-17 20:54:00,241, Too true! I only wish that he was playing his Telecaster and tearing it up. That dude has ridiculous chicken pickin' skills.
250609,holdfast,2008-09-17 22:16:00,1813,Not bad for a bunch of fossils
250647,perodimi,2008-09-17 23:35:00,124,Here's another great guitar solo:  
250663,Pigeontroller,2008-09-18 00:02:00,2793,"Thats an awesome concert! I have the DVD and the CD. George's best friends(and his Son), one year after his death, playing their hearts out!"
250723,holdfast,2008-09-18 02:58:00,1813," Great solo for sure.  But for me, the best guitarist in the world by far is David Gilmour.  Im in awe listening to his stuff.  Check out his DVD or Pink Floyds Live DVD. Just awesome"
250791,BITEME,2008-09-18 12:06:00,1969,   I will second that
250823,Headhunter,2008-09-18 14:10:00,5703,"My intention is not to hijack this thread, but I just can't help myself... bought a new bass guitar on the weekend and I haven't been able to put it down since! Here's a link to the shop's web site where he has posted pics of the bass hanging in his shop! It seems to play itself! Has incredible variance of tone and as you can see, it's a looker!!!!! Just had to show off a bit! http://www.clubbass.ca/instock/LG3000.html HH"
250826,Roy,2008-09-18 14:19:00,13728,"Wow! Nice bass indeed, Joe. What did get her on?"
250832,blaque,2008-09-18 14:34:00,2419," I enjoyed this more than the stage full of artists actually. I like when someone can perform....oneman, one instrument, and just send out goosebumps with the music. The percussion toward the end of the clapton crew got the foot tappin, but if it werent for that section, i dunno.....i was bored lol. ......and I will third that Dave Gilmour, has got a definite gift to evoke emotions out of a 6 string, ive tried to get that sound out of mine, and its just not there.......of course, a bus full of sound and studio equipment does wonders!!"
250839,Headhunter,2008-09-18 14:43:00,5703,"""Wow! Nice bass indeed, Joe. What did get her on?"" I got her on ""The Queensway!"" Not sure who got hooked here, but so far, I'm not fighin it into the boat!LOL HH"
250844,Rich,2008-09-18 14:55:00,3927,If you like some incredible metal guitar check this out:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A3X1nk_sS4  BFMV greatest metal band ever!
250860,blaque,2008-09-18 15:40:00,2419, Its amazing the talent that has evolved in metal aye Rich? No more getting away with just some distorted power chord riffs and crunching the E string as fast as you can with a double bass pounding in the back. (as good enough as that is lol)  The Melodic Metal scene has EXPLODED and you can fill an 80GB i-pod with it in no time with the amount of bands that have surfaced.  Right now im full up on:  Lamb of God All that remains In this moment (female vocals) Killswitch Engage BFMV In Flames Opeth it goes on and on
250867,BITEME,2008-09-18 15:55:00,1969,  NOT!!!!!!!!!!!  saw them open for a band a few years ago and was not impressed..thought they sucked backside JMO
250893,bigfish1965,2008-09-18 17:14:00,3382, Gilmour depresses me so much. I watch him play a song and thing..that don't look so tough..then I try it and loose my mind..lol
250895,danbouck,2008-09-18 17:18:00,4380,Great Vid! Saw Clapton play last year and still can't believe that I actually witnessed guitar playing like that!
250901,blaque,2008-09-18 17:31:00,2419," Thats exactly how it is too!! Ive picked up the music for Comfortably numb like 10 times in the last few years, sayin, this is it, im GOING to learn these solos. And i just cant get them licked, not enough to enjoy playin them anyway. This thread had me youtubin gilmour today at work, and im going to go home again today and pull out the tabliture, and im sure ill be puttin it back in the filing cabinet yet again within an hour lol, but like you said, it doesnt look that hard......thats the thing, they are so good that they MAKE it LOOK easy lol. Dave makes it look so effortless."
250907,JohnAB,2008-09-18 17:39:00,178,"No doubting Ole Slow Hands guitar prowess.  One performance I have always enjoyed and seen live is Mark Knopfler doing Sultans of Swing. From minute 5 till the end it is magical in my mind.    Or Eddie Van Halen doing the Eruption solo.    But then again Gilmour, Hendrix, Page, Lifeson, BB King etc are all very good when it comes time to make their guitar sing."
250917,Headhunter,2008-09-18 18:14:00,5703,"Ok... you guys asked for it! The above players are all great players, Slow Hand for his style, Glimour for his sound, Eddie for bringing Holdsworth to the masses, Knopler for getting his chicks for free, but if you really like guitar players, you will be hard pressed to find two better, than these two! Every time I hear this song (incredible album by the way) I feel like it's time to take up the drums! Enjoy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ypeZ6R-t0  HH"
250925,huey graphite,2008-09-18 18:46:00,362,"  Gotta agree with you. Gilmour is one of a kind. I love the classic rock guitarists...Gilmour, Van Halen, Lifeson, Rik Emmett, Steven Stills .....but one of my favorites is Joe Satriani."
251088,ehg,2008-09-19 02:52:00,2666,"Gotta agree with Headhunter on the Di meola, De Lucia, McLaughlin concert. Had to be the pinnacle of guitar playing at the time. I played that album alot.  But Eddie Van Halen was rocking fer sure as well. That Van Halen video must be over 25 yrs. ago. Makes me feel old. lol "
