My ""cousin-in-law"" is over from the Netherlands, and is fascinated with the trout/salmon coming up stream to spawn, and I would like to get him a DVD to go home with before he leaves in a few weeks that is a documentary-type about them.  Anyone have an idea if these are available, if yes...where could I get one?   Thanks in advance.  *Stoty"

253707,BillM,2008-09-29 20:49:00,17367,Your best bet is going to be ordering an older National Geographic/PBS or Nature episode...  I am sure they sell their episodes on DVD.
253736,Beats,2008-09-29 22:04:00,543,"I dont know about DVD's but I know that over at gettinghooked.net they have downloadable episodes on trout and salmon fishing.  I particularly remember one called Dropback Steelhead.  I know, as well, that Bob Izumi's site Realfishing.com has streaming episodes of steelhead fishing in the Meaford area.."
