253438,chris.brock,2008-09-29 02:42:00,4053,"it's pretty safe boating if your running down the middle  the walleye seem to be tough, I'm pretty sure there is big ones in there, it's a huge lake, there is almost always a period of fast action just as the sun is going down, but almost all the fish are really small, they don't seem to want a jig and plastic (mr twister), they seem to only take a worm/ leach/ or minnow  the pike are hard to target, we only seem to catch them while walleye fishing  never fished for the whitefish but have heard of people doing well, I think I've marked them down deep while looking for lakers  beautiful, large lake, nice camp, great owners, good price but we won't go back because the fishing isn't good enough"
