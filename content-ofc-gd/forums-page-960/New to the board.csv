252443,Streamerguy,2008-09-24 20:26:00,121," Now if i told you,i'd have to kill ya"
252892,Rich,2008-09-26 14:51:00,3927," I can tell you're from around here originally man.. there's no such thing as a ""silver bass"" that's Norfolk county slang .. they're white bass. White perch are smaller and the stripes are less defined.  Great intro Streamerguy, glad to have ya here.  Oh yeah, and there was only 1 musky pic, the first little guy. The rest were pike."

253412,ehg,2008-09-29 02:03:00,2666, Usually i'm decent at identification but what is this thing?
253419,snag,2008-09-29 02:14:00,1932, Looks like a white sucker.  (I recognize my own kind)
253560,ehg,2008-09-29 14:54:00,2666," Ha! Ha! SNAG, i don't think it's a white sucker i've seen millions of those. they are long and skinny not stout. Thinking maybe a black or silver redhorse sucker, the light spots and mouth are weird. "
253591,TJQ,2008-09-29 16:16:00,7806,Welcome.... when are ya gonna start doing some fishing??
253718,Streamerguy,2008-09-29 21:27:00,121," I was told it was a sucker and that's about all i wanted to know about it,pretty ugly looking fish if ya ask me.About it being stout? think it was a female carrying eggs!!!Anyhow here's another pic of it      TY TJ... and i already have bud, but i'm having a little dilema!! Went out friday night and my buddy caught an 18lber,I caught 3 ...2 PB and my 16th species for the year and 2 PB last friday,well i showed the sturgeon but i also caught a 7lb catfish(sorry no pics).But this friday went VERY well and i'm afraid if i post it and people recongnize the area,it could turn into a zoo by NEXT friday!!! It was at night but very distintive to someone who knows the area  the pros and cons of posting?   any advise would be appeaciated. The report is rdy to go,but do i wait a day/week/month to get my fishing in without bumping shoulders when the zoo arrives??   or Just post it and say the hell with it ? i got strong shoulders...  let me know,cheers Streamerguy"
253727,ctdd2006,2008-09-29 21:43:00,531,"I'd say based on some of the conversations I've had here with some folks that the bit of company you might find yourself in on the bank would be welcomed company.   There are a lot of good people here....I wish more of you were from my way!  Keep up the great work!  Also, you could always edit the pic to disguise the area I suppose.  Cheers."
251570,Streamerguy,2008-09-21 18:18:00,121,"Hello All,   New to the boards and wanted to say hello to all of you fine anglers out there. I have been lurking this site for sometime now and have really enjoyed all the report's, pics conversations and overall attitude of the members here,I am impressed with the wealth of knowledge and information,always willing to share,excellent job and site.  My first experience with fishing was when i was 11 yrs old and went on vacation with my family back home to paspebiac,Quebec (i was born in bonaventure,Quebec but lived here in niagara falls ,Ontario since i was 2 months old) Mom had me when she was on vacation, Well my grandpops would take me out every morning by 7am and leave me on the pier and by noon he would bring me something to eat and then pick me up around dinner time,this was the best fishing ive ever had to date 24 flounder in 1 day.(still havent seen numbers like that) After that i more or less stopped fishing when i hit my teens to chase girls,hang with friends,play sports(mostly hockey).  Back in march /06 i fractured my tibia plateau and had knee surgery to repair it (5 screws,steel plate and a 3inch donor bone to do the trick),the doc told me ""no weight bearing for 3 months"" after the 3 months my left leg lost alot of muscle and mass,my sport playing days are over...so i needed something to do,get out of the house, something that i could do standing for a few hours a day to work the muscles in my leg, well that's when i decided to start fishing again.But wait i have no fishing gear at all, (except for the old tackle box i had when i was a kid)so off to the tackle shop and buy a rod and reel combo,line,hooks,sinkers etc...oh and most importanly SENKO'S   Within a year and half,I now own 5 rods and have more tackle than i can use (fishing is very addicting,lol)...I also had more luck in the fish species and PB this year IN /08,so i would like to show you all a few pics  first up stipped bass / SM Bass         next a couple pike     a few Muskie             my 2 eyes     1 and only brown   lakers and bows             sheephead (freshwater drum)    and last but not least i caught my 1st on friday night first pic he did this    I hope you enjoy the pics as i did catching these guys,all pics are from april /08 to present day and ALL from shore..thats what i call a great 6 months for me  cheers Streamerguy"

251835,ehg,2008-09-22 17:34:00,2666,"Yes, i would concur with reefrunners statement. Think the first couple of fish are considered white bass."
251995,mikeh,2008-09-23 02:35:00,824,"that was a great intro, keep the pictures coming."
251998,chickenhawk,2008-09-23 02:42:00,612, they are actually silver bass.....or white perch i believe.......either welcome to the board Streamerguy it'll be a pleasure to have you on here.....   Hawk

I hope to see more of your musky pics but please take care of these guys and try not to let them lay in the dirt even the small ones like that need care. Glad to see you hunt for alot of different fish up your way.
252168,Streamerguy,2008-09-23 21:13:00,121,"WOW....I really don't know what to really say here guys...... but What a Welcome TY  This OFC Community is awesome guys, i really appreaciate you taking the time to say Hello!!

252189,Beats,2008-09-23 22:19:00,543,"That's a white bass.  Unless you are fishing fairly close to salt water, I wouldn't think you would be seeing many striped bass."
252201,Streamerguy,2008-09-23 22:34:00,121," Thank-you for the correction,  white bass is it then........like i said before they have a beautiful chrome to them and are alot of fun to catch,caught 4 of them and all were chrome & very clean fish and all released.  cheers Streamerguy"
