I had no success with any of these techineques. I then used a Strike King bass jig tipped with a Yum Chunk and started flipping the jig very close to any cover i could find. After about 10 minuted i brought my jig in quickly and a nice size bass slammed it. This would count to be my FIRST largemouth bass on a bass jig  . I guess you could say i was ""swimming"" the jig. The bass weighed 2.8lbs.  "
253283,Paully,2008-09-28 20:32:00,712,Your a brave man fishing scugog from shore... lots of weeds. But i guess it paid off for ya! nice bass!
253351,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-28 23:06:00,3761," O ya thats for sure. I didn't get to fish it as much as i would of liked this year, i was there just after bass season opened and maybe once during the summer. I should be there a few more times before the season is done. Wish me luck!"
