When I got home there were 1,  then 2, bushels of tomatoes, a 1/4 bushel of peppers, and a 1/2 bushel of pears waiting on the doorstep. So much for any fishing plans.  Round one produced the following. 4 pans of pear cobbler  1 1/2 gallons of salsa  Plus I managed to bag and freeze another 60lbs of tomato. I am now on round two. In the pots are 4 gallons of pasta sauce and another gallon of my ""Roadkill Chilli""  Once I get that done I still have this to process.   It can be a long cold winter, but we won't starve   I'll surely need to go fishinh tomorrow after this is all done."
