253069,Cast Adventures,2008-09-27 15:29:00,74,"Well it's that time of year again!  With water temps yesterday morning at 66.5 on the upper we decided to try our luck for steelhead. We ended up hooking some nice little steelhead and landing these ones.   In the past three days we've landed steelhead from Navy Island to just above the peace bridge. Steelhead are now spread through out the whole system! Lots of room and fish to go around for both shore and boat anglers! Guys from shore are starting to hit fish around the fort erie area. Floatfishing and casting spoons seems to be working.      We landed our 1st steelhead on the lower    Roe that we purchased from FISHIN NIAGARA has worked the best for me! Thanks again denis for all your help! If you've never fish the upper niagara for steelhead before, stop by the store and talk to denis! He has all the tackle needed to catch fish and he might even share a few spots to get you started!  It's a big river with LOTS of fish to go around! go get em'!  see you on the river,"

253279,Cast Adventures,2008-09-28 20:10:00,74,"  Bassfighter,  The Smallmouth and Largemouth fishing on the river have been very productive! Bigger smallmouth are showing up again in the river and really starting to put the feed bag on! In this past week we've witnessed largies in school of 15 or more along different weedlines and shore lines. (mostly smaller fish, 1.5-to-2.5lbs) Talking with different local anglers reports of  catching smallmouth bass in depths from 10 to 60 feet from lake erie seem to be the norm.  good luck"
