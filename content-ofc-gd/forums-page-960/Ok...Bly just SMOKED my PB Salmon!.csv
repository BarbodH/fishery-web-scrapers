252929,fatherof3,2008-09-26 17:32:00,1769,wtg Bly! That is a nice one for sure.
252934,snag,2008-09-26 17:43:00,1932,Double Dang!  Is your nail polish scented Carole!!!!   
252943,Bly,2008-09-26 18:30:00,1556,"Thank you everyone!!  I must thank my net man also....if it weren't for Cliff, the battle may have ended differently!        I haven't a clue how to keep a fish like that still but I do have an excellent camera man     I lifted the fish maybe 18 inches and realized there was no way I was going to be able to safely hold it with my arms alone, it was resting on my legs for the picture.   The power was amazing, I cannot even imagine fighting a fish like that in it's prime.   Not likely   Still have so very much to learn   Bill, I'd be happy to trade that salmon for some of the gorgeous brookies that you catch   We share many things but that is not one of them.....my polish is strictly off limits to him   Thanks Rich, that fish was caught off a pier in about 15-20' of water.  I tried the trib a couple of times last year for salmon and didn't care for it.  Prefer the piers, using the canoe in the harbor or wading out into the lake for them.   "
252963,Terry,2008-09-26 20:39:00,14456,"well I am sure the local moron who has been dumping on me about photoshopping will have something negative to say but here goes anyway           <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=bly.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/bly.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"

252804,ccmtcanada,2008-09-26 02:32:00,7971,"One night after I said on the board that I just couldn't break the 40"" mark with Salmon, Bly completely destroyed it!!!  Anyhow...first the story.  We got to the same spot as last night...we could hear and see salmon jumping close by.  Once again, those glow in the dark cleos did the trick!  We were feeling strikes, but no hookups....until Bly suddenly says ""Ok...fish on!"".  This fish would NOT come up at first and she wasn't able to make any headway on it.  She managed to turn it's head around a few times to keep it under control, but lose 10 feet in the process....this went on for a good 10 minutes.  Suddenly, it goes on a straight run away from her....line is peeling from her reel like there's no tomorrow.  I look down and see her gently thumb her spool and sure enough....the little added pressure did the trick, and she got it turned around and started to reel it back in.  When I looked down and saw the fish I told her it was a HUGE one!  It barely fit in our net....but we got it out of the water.  Here it is...not the prettiest fish, but a BIG one!  It measured in at 45"" and weighed a whopping 34 pounds 1 ounce!! "
