"
253123,PatrickGG,2008-09-27 22:54:00,562,"Nice Smallies, I haven't had the opportunity to hit Cooch this year but hopefully next year it will be on my hit list lake to fish."
253134,Cudz,2008-09-28 00:34:00,2652,Cool stuff.  Can't wait to see that show. I picked up some slammers at Simcoe Bait today.  They had very few left and she was surprised they were in such short supply.  I picked up a smoke with copper and pumpkinseed with red flk.  The smoke copper should work well for me on Simcoe.  I will let you know. I also bought some size 1 circle hooks and I alsready have a bunch of octopus hooks at home.  I will try the circle hooks first.
