253619,anders,2008-09-29 17:14:00,1168,"Well, as in the title i broke my 7 ft Shimano Izumi series baitcaster this weekend   at a point were the rod tip cannot be saved, so i have to get a new one  .  The old rod was a two piece, and it was a great rod, lots of backbone and a great tip.  However i found a Fenwick HMX on line but its a one piece.  What the difference between a two piece and a one piece (besides the obvious for all you quite witted folks out there) in quality and performance, and does anyone have any experience with both.  Thanks a million  Anders"
253635,steverowbotham,2008-09-29 17:33:00,1800,"A one piece rod offers more sensitivity and strength as there is no ""break"" in the unit.  The only true advantage to a 2 piece rod is travel and storage convenience"
253637,maybo,2008-09-29 17:36:00,86,"if you want a decent baitcaster, get a one piece rod. suggest you get a shimano compre, rod has lifetime warranty."
253649,bbog,2008-09-29 18:06:00,665,If I'm not mistaken the Bob Izumi signature series also came with a lifetime warranty. Be interesting to see what the replacement would be given that these rods are no longer available.
253654,anders,2008-09-29 18:18:00,1168,"yeah...i havent been able to make any contact about the warrenty, plus half the rod went down the drink when it snapped"
253664,chickenhawk,2008-09-29 18:45:00,612,Definately go with the one piece......my suggestion is St. Croix though.....amazing rods!  Good luck with ur decision...  Hawk

253672,bucktail,2008-09-29 19:01:00,1857,My last two St Croixs have broken at the ferrule. Makes me wonder if they have changed manufacturing techniques. I have picked up 3 Loomis's over the last year and am super pleased with them.
253676,danbo,2008-09-29 19:06:00,2646,Berkley Series 1 or Tactix are OK .
253678,Wild,2008-09-29 19:07:00,704,Shimano has a limited lifetime warranty so be aware of that. if anyone has experience dealing with Shimano please speak up. If you have problems then send your rod to Bob
253682,Oktravis,2008-09-29 19:29:00,62,i had the same bob izumi rod.when it broke i took it to ackmanns in mississauga ( i dont think i spelled that right)after the 3rd brake he could not supply that rod anymore so he upgraded me to a 1 piece shimano clairus.that rod hasn`t broke yet  even if you dont have the broken piece you should still take it in to see what he can do  i dont have the address or phone number(they are at confedration and dundas in mississauga)im sure someone one the board has that info  good luck travis  i just noticed where you are located so ackmanns is probably out but i would still check into warenty
