253246,ehg,2008-09-28 17:22:00,2666,"Was supposed to go out for muskies this weekend but buddy had some things come up. Too bad. Had some free time Sunday morning so took a little drive northwest of Toronto and tried for some brook trout before the season closed instead. Sure looked like fall out there this morning.   Especially on the dirt roads   The river looked inviting though   Caught a few little brookies there only took picture of one little guy   Did catch a couple of nicer ones   This one was nicest one of morning   Caught a nicer more colourful fish prepared to get picture of it and then it shook off i was taking pic by the water so it flipped in and swam off. Thats why last fish is more on shore. Looks like last outing for me for brookies till next year.  At least the muskies will be feeding good for next couple of months. Cheers, ehg"

253260,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-28 18:33:00,241,Congrats! Looks like you a had a great morning out there!
253266,BillM,2008-09-28 19:22:00,17367,"Erik, good job man!  I am going to give brookie one more shot on Tuesday, then it's back to bass/muskie and steelhead in the colder months!"
253365,douG,2008-09-28 23:50:00,2693,Specks are only like my favorite fish ever.  Very nice catching.
253409,ehg,2008-09-29 01:49:00,2666,"Thanks for replies!  Those brook trout are real beauts. Done all the fishing from steelheading to musky to Quinte eyes etc... But this is probably my favorite fishing despite their size. Real gifts from nature these fish.   Always C&R these fish now, have ate some in the past, they are delicious fer sure.  Thanks again, ehg"
253423,camillj,2008-09-29 02:23:00,1988,Pretty fish .. thanks for sharing ... and yes I can honestly say they are the best tasting fish (followed closely by Pickeral and rainbows) ... but I agree the populations in the smaller streams are really not able to sustain the fishing pressure unless the ministry really ups the ante on stocking .... on the other hand some of those real deep woods back lakes are special
253427,snag,2008-09-29 02:26:00,1932,I'm pretty sure that a stream that runs behind my parents place holds specs.  I'll have to give it a go when I visit next.  Thanks again
253442,Mike the Pike,2008-09-29 02:48:00,3421,Very pretty little fish and ya can't find them in St.Bruno
