252858,bassman,2008-09-26 12:43:00,384,Are you allowed to use two rods per person on Lake Erie?  Thanks in advance
252861,jwl,2008-09-26 12:55:00,1056,"in open water you can..not the St Claire or Detroit Rivers,not marinas and harbours and such..just in the open water of the lake"
252890,Rich,2008-09-26 14:45:00,3927,Most sheltered bays are also excepted. For instance you can't use 2 rods within the inner bay of Long Point Bay. The rule is basically for people trolling open water.
252960,Billy Bob,2008-09-26 20:21:00,5865,DUMB rule you have there. We can fish two rods anywhere.  Bob
253036,Rich,2008-09-27 09:54:00,3927,A dumb rule by the OMNR?! Unheard of!
253040,Fisherman,2008-09-27 11:52:00,7201,
253044,bigugli,2008-09-27 12:52:00,6138,"I don't remember which states, but some allow the use of up to 8 rods for crappie fishing. I've  seen the rig they mount them on across the bow of the boat. There is no sport in that at all. However, as they say, to each his own. I can only cast one rod at a time."
253077,Billy Bob,2008-09-27 16:35:00,5865," OH, we have MANY dumb rules here, too many to list. But when you are trolling the Great Lakes you really need a presentation of many lures/baits in the water column.  I myself only use more than one rod while Great Lake trolling. Even though we can use two rods in our inland lakes I find it a hindrance more than helpful while for example crappie fishing. Even when I am perch fishing on Lake Erie I  only use one rod because I can better concentrate on the light biters and I don't want to make fishing a chore. When I was younger I always used two rods but I think I catch more fish using only one now."
253091,forrest,2008-09-27 18:06:00,1032,  hahahahahahaha
253104,StrealHeader,2008-09-27 21:39:00,56, So then what exactly makes it a dumb rule?
253227,Billy Bob,2008-09-28 15:27:00,5865," If you're referring to the one rod rule in some of the Great Lake waters in Canadian waters while Canada still allows gill net fishing for commercial fishermen. That's one of the reasons it's IMHO a dumb rule. The US outlawed gill netting YEARS ago on the Great Lakes.  Here in NYS most waters have a 15"" minimum rule for walleye. But while deep water jigging during the LATE fall walleye bite I catch many fish just under 15"". Since they are caught in very deep water, sometimes as deep as 70' the release survival rate is low. It would be much better to just have a 5 fish limit of any size during this time of the year. That way I wouldn't catch 15-20 fish to get five keepers. Another dumb rule IMHO.  Bob"
