253045,Chris Cross,2008-09-27 12:54:00,46,On Wed. 4 of us drove to Parry sound and flew out to a lake for the day. They have boats and motors there. We spent the day catching bass and pike. Good times indeed. With tax in it cost $250 per man. The flight was worth it!!!!! We are going back next year for sure.CX
