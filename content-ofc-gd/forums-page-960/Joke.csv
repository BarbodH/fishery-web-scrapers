'I'm calling to report 'bout my neighbor Jack Murphy...He's hidin' marijuana inside his firewood! Don't quite know how he gets it inside   them logs, but he's hidin' it there..'  'Thank you very much for the call, sir.'  The next day, twelve Police Officers descend on Jack's house. They search the shed where the firewood is kept.  Using axes, they bust open every piece of wood, but find no  marijuana.  They sneer at Jack and leave.   Shortly, the phone rings at Jack's house. 'Hey, Jack! This here's Floyd....Did the Police come?'  'Yeah!'  'Did they chop your firewood?'  'Yep!'  'Happy Birthday, buddy!'  (Newfies know how to get'er done)"

The lawyer asks if he would like to play a fun game. The Newfoundlander is tired and just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and tries to catch a few winks.  The lawyer persists, says that the game is a lot of fun. ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me only $5. You ask me one, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.""  This catches the Newfoundlander's attention and to keep the lawyer quiet, agrees to play the game.  The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?""  The Newfoundlander doesn't say a word, reaches in his pocket pulls out a five-dollar bill, and hands it to the lawyer.  Now, it's the Newfoundlander's turn. He asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?""  The lawyer uses his laptop, searches all references. He uses the Air phone. He searches the Net and even the Library of Congress. He sends e-mails to all the smart friends he knows, all to no avail. After one hour of searching he finally gives up. He wakes up the Newfoundlander and hands him $500. The Newfoundlander pockets the $500 and goes right back to sleep.  The lawyer is going nuts not knowing the answer. He wakes the Newfoundlander up and asks, ""Well, so what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four?""  The Newfoundlander reaches in his pocket, hands the lawyer $5 and goes back to sleep."
