253200,aniceguy,2008-09-28 13:14:00,1094,"While some guys are multi species anglers, I have generally been a 2 species sort of guy....With hot chrome being the first obsession and then bass as a close second to that.  Around this time of year in past years I find my longsticks get a lot of use while the shorter stout rods become a part of an ornimental rod rack along the entire wall of a garage( of course with the usual what the heck do you need 30 rods for bass) coming from non angling friends, this year with the new boat and such I found my self thinking greens and browns a lot more.  Anyhow as summer turns to fall and the long stick will begin to dominate and while there are several bass trips still in the plan I thought I would post some pictures from the summer..enjoy                    of course I simply cant toss in all the bass without a few of my fav species out in the lake      thanks for reading and here is a small video from the summer  http://ca.youtube.com/miloman1001"
