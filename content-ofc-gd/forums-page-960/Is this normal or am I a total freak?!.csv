253474,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-29 10:26:00,241,"It's been about 1 year now or so since I rediscovered this obsession with nearly all things fishing. And now it seems to have made its way into my sleep state as well. I have fishing related dreams at least 3 days a week and it's gotten so absurd that I often find myself waking to the sounds of my own laughter! I have one recurring dream where I hook about a 46' northern, bring it into shore only to have it snap the line and swim off to freedom right as I'm about to snap a picture. Am I insane? Should I seek therapy? Or do others share my sickness?!"
253475,Cudz,2008-09-29 10:36:00,2652,I often have fishing dreams.  I never get the same one twice though.  lol
253477,Greencoachdog,2008-09-29 10:43:00,8163,I think you're havin' one of these Billy:  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=0Yp9ASVUg_A
253479,Dondorfish,2008-09-29 10:49:00,1000,Sounds to me like the after-effects of GCD's moonshine - did you perhaps sample it at Lakair?  Don  
253480,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-29 10:51:00,241, 'Sample it' is a HUGE understatement. I reckon I was one of those blind mice that Joey was referring to! To the detriment of my liver...
253481,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-29 10:52:00,241, Ha ha ha ha!!
253485,ccmtcanada,2008-09-29 11:24:00,7971,Recurring dream huh?  Ok...that's weird...LOL.  Glen...where do you find these videos?
253508,Spiel,2008-09-29 12:20:00,9065, ....Yes!   ....Yes!   ....and yes!
253529,Wild,2008-09-29 13:19:00,704,"Anyone who dreams of hooking a 46 ft northern does have fishing issues especially when you start detailing your lures, cleaning your reels and when you start polishing your rod your ready to be committed for life!"
253530,snag,2008-09-29 13:23:00,1932,You're a nutter
253593,Rich,2008-09-29 16:17:00,3927,"You know what's odd? Since I was like 3 I've been obsessed with fishing, but to the best of my knowledge I've never once in my life had a dream that had anything to do with fishing."
253594,kemper,2008-09-29 16:20:00,2232,"You are fine, I on the other  hand have the real issue...  When I close my eyes hoping for sleep, any first person type dream-thoughts I have I am wearing skates. ALWAYS  does not matter if I am fishing in my dream or running or swimming, I have SKATES ON.  VERY frustrating, and has kept me up all night many times"
253665,highdrifter,2008-09-29 18:45:00,2534,You're absolutely off your rocker!!  That's why we hang duude..  H to the D
253670,chickenhawk,2008-09-29 18:49:00,612,I too have found myself day dreaming about fishing.....just sitting there staring off into space thinking about fish that i caught in the past and stuff.....i love it!!! lol  Hawk
253671,ehg,2008-09-29 18:58:00,2666,"Don't worry Billy it only means you like fishing  Had a dream not long ago that i caught a world record smallmouth bass right in front of my house while fishing in a sewer here in downtown Toronto. Best, most memorable dream ever."
253684,ozaibak1,2008-09-29 19:43:00,401,"I had a bunch of recurring fishing dreams during winter time, it was interesting as I would be at the same lake each time and fish different parts of it each dream. I believe I had caught muskie and walleye but no bass. I catch bass a lot but never caught a muskie or walleye... go figure."
