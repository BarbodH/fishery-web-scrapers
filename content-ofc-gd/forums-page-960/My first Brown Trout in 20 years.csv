253252,Cudz,2008-09-28 17:45:00,2652,"One of my children had a bday party to attend and I noticed that the party was near a creek I used to fish about 20 years ago.  I decided to bring some worms and a rod.  I dropped her off and had about 1 hour to fish. I know this creek used to hold browns but I wasn't sure if they were still there.  I was walking quite far away from the creek and trying not to make noise as it is not too big and very clear.  Despite my best efforts I did spook a small trout and darted away from me.  I walked a bit further downstream.  I saw a nice log in the middle of the creek so casted my weightless piece of warm.  To my surprise a little missile came out of the opposite bank and smaked the worm.  It was funny because I was fishing the log and the trout came from the other shore bank nowhere near the log. Anyway, I haven't fished for these for 20 years so it was cool getting one.  She was small but very pretty.  I released her to be caught another day. "

253264,bigugli,2008-09-28 19:17:00,6138,Kinda neat going back to an old haunt and finding the fish are still there
253287,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-28 20:43:00,3761,"Nice fish man, congrads"
253334,Cudz,2008-09-28 22:39:00,2652,"I've been told the cake was a princess ballerina cake (chocolate).  Apparently it was very good.  I no longer fish streams so I have nothing light.  I was using a ML 6'6"" spinning rod with a medium sized reel.  8 pound mono.  This is actually my drop shot setup.  It was about the lightest combo I could come up with."
253340,Wild,2008-09-28 22:47:00,704,Well Cudz the cake sounds great but just remember that next party you have to bring back a slice for everyone! Err at least for me   I just bought a 5 ft ultralight and fitted it with a micro reel now that would have been really fun with that brown.
253368,Cudz,2008-09-28 23:58:00,2652,That would have been nice. I used to have 2 of them but I think somehow my dad inherited both and they are with him in Edmonton.
