1047038,Terry,2019-07-13 16:35:00,14456,nice going 
1047039,crappieperchhunter,2019-07-13 16:37:00,2582,Persistance pays off Brian. Beauty morning to be out on the water and you where rewarded  with  a nice one. Well done and thx for sharing.

1047043,misfish,2019-07-13 18:30:00,29133,Their a lot more elusive then those whities I chase Steve. Atleast I know their areas when the temps are right. These lakers will travel any where this time of year. Water temps seemed to have dropped a bit if you can believe that. 19.2 C this morning. Probly the wave action the past week.

1047047,David Chong,2019-07-13 21:11:00,836,Nice greaser!
1047048,aplumma,2019-07-13 21:24:00,6896,Very nice fish Brian glad you had time to get out and fish a little. Art
1047050,SirCranksalot,2019-07-13 23:27:00,3291,So did you get any tips from that son of yours???
1047056,Rattletrap2,2019-07-14 03:12:00,1652,"Geez, that thing is a monster! Great going Brian!"
1047076,ecmilley,2019-07-14 19:50:00,2163,Simcoe  has to be the toughest lake to pattern some.days just make no sense when you can drag a laker and a smallie off the same baitfish cloud in July in 35 ft of water
1047099,LeXXington,2019-07-15 19:17:00,1928,Nice to see
1047101,misfish,2019-07-15 20:09:00,29133,I have heard they are chasing the gobys as a food source.
1047102,muskymatt,2019-07-15 22:12:00,2608,Very nice!
1047103,ecmilley,2019-07-15 22:51:00,2163,As a apex predator lakers pretty much eat anything. We had lakers puking up gobys 20 years ago in port hope
1047105,misfish,2019-07-15 23:00:00,29133,Interesting. I figure they are coming up from steep drops to feed .
