1046375,porkpie,2019-06-29 14:23:00,2521,There is usually a big hatch in north bay right about now!
1046406,Rattletrap2,2019-06-30 12:38:00,1652,"40 years ago, we used to go to North Bay and if you went to see a movie or anything in town, when you came out, you would nearly slip and fall on them! The cars would be covered and so would the street. They always called them Shad Flies, but same thing as you pictured. We get them here on the pond as well, but not this year yet."

You try to get gas after a hatch and your going to be squishin shadflys by the hundreds.  Go in to Tim’s for a coffee and they’ll be a ton of them inside the restaurant lol.  It’s something to see.  The amount of larvae on the sonar screen when out fishing is unbelievable as well.
