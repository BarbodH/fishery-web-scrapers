BP was another one I wanted to do but didnt have the capital to get in at such a high share price. When the oil spill happened but they finally got things under control I wanted to buy because the stock value took a total beating, the fundamentals of the company havent changed, the company will still make money so theres always a clear upside.  Most recently once again i didnt have the capital to invest, but when nike dropped the colin kapernick ad and all of the racist investors bailed outta the stock I told my friends to all buy, sure enough the stock hit an all time high about a week later.

DIY investing is inherently risky, and as long as your not playing with your retirement funds and your prepared to lose the funds you have allocated to it, the go for it.

My retirement funds are safely invested elsewhere in a balanced portfolio of 60% equities (growth) and 40% fixed (bonds etc) .......set it, and forget it, except to rebalance as required to keep the 60/40 mix. No GICS, No Mutual Funds.....and the btw, the Bank is not your friend.  Here’s my personal approach to DIY “investing”, and I used quotations, because I don’t consider it as really investing.....it’s more like playing the market. Buy good stuff when it’s on sale. When everyone is buying or selling, consider doing the opposite. Don’t let other people’s emotions drive your decisions i.e. FOMO When you buy a stock, immediately create a sell order with a “stop limit”, so if your fortune reverses, at least it will sell before your your shirt.....and keep adjusting as it rises in value, but leave some room for ‘noise’.

There are companies working on drug identification numbers which would make medicinal mj covered by your drug plan.  Some insurers already cover it for certain ailments.

Since 90' and a big loss divorce in 90' (6 digits to my former wife and living in a flea bag motel in Hammertown) I have invested in Real Estate and only that. I want to see it, touch it, and smell it. Even keep me dry when it rains and warm when it's cold. Tangible assets. I have done not bad in real estate, took my 25 years and out pension at the plant at 45 and haven't missed any meals since.

He's talking 100K for him, another 50K for his 70 something Mom and another 100  his brother is going to invest. I suggest we take a road trip to BC. A few days, see the sights and visit the offices of this company, what's to lose, flights are a few hundred with the new airline West Jet. This is 1991. Long story short, there are no offices, the address is a parking lot. This happens all the time, especially when times are tough. People get really stupid when they are in need. "

Those that work hard at it, are diligent, research the company (like flying across the country to visit the plant) generally these are the ones that are successful in an ever changing market. I'm the touchy feely type of investor. Burned 1 too many times by a slickster including a Ponzy scheme when I was desperate and greedy, stupid too. I will never get over that dough head move. Don't get greedy. It happens. See my by line below."

If you like to play ""sometimes you win and sometimes you lose,""  it's fun and the more educated you are about the company the better shot you have. If the returns sound too good, chances are the need suckers to keep buying. Check if they still offer TFSA in stock trading account.  They did for a while until some guys were making big money tax free.  The fed's got wind and were going to put stops in place. TD stock trading is good but expensive they do offer reports etc that really help.  Lots of low cost trading accounts but you get what you pay for . Have fun   "

In the finally months Nortel went to .50 and I bought 6000. My profit goal was 100% and I sold at $1.15 . Never looked back don't care that it went to $7.90 it went to zero shortly after.

1022022,G.mech,2018-01-29 16:04:00,830,"The only issue with TFSA's is that there are limits for how much you can put in each year.  If you are starting at zero, you can go back to 2009 (when they were invented) and top up to the $52,000 accumulated maximum.  The annual limit was recently reduced to $5500 from $10,000.   There are also lots of rules about frequency of trades & types of holdings within TFSA's too that need to be considered. The guy mentioned earlier who turned his TFSA from about $40k into $1.5M since 2009 did fairly well it would seem as he has achieved about 3600% over the 8 years (or 400% or so annualized).  I would get investing advice from him."

1022200,Dan668,2018-02-03 18:00:00,1120,Ive been out of weed stocks for the past month. It was fun while it lasted.
1022203,grimsbylander,2018-02-03 18:23:00,3016,It's not gone forever. The retail cannibis market hasn't even begun yet so there's lots of room for natural growth. What may be gone is the sudden increases caused by volume demand and not by actual value. It's now an investment market as opposed to a trading market. I'd have ZERO issue buying stock this week at a corrected value with a long position.
1022205,Raf,2018-02-03 18:41:00,3495,"agree.  i own WEED and APH, long term I'm still bullish on these two.  now if I bought at the highs maybe i'd be pooping bricks but my average cost is still below current prices.  i see a lot of consolidation in the sector in the next few weeks and maybe some sideways movement.  i do believe we're close to or at the end of the sell-off for the time being and expect a bounce monday.  let's not forget the entire market was beaten down this week, not just this sector."

1022293,Moosebunk,2018-02-04 21:50:00,3970,"Started ""gamble"" investing in weed this December.  Wonderfully I was up 40% in two weeks before the New Year and cashed out some before a big downslide but, things have certainly fallen across the board since then, especially in the last week.  Reality is though, I don't really know squat.  This is all just a feeling and it may work out, may not, but if it crashes down I'm not out on the street at all.  My roommate here in Nunavut turned his first $10,000 investment in weed at $0.18 last April into a return of $100,000+ when he cashed it all out in October at $1.93.  That peaked my interest in all this and so decidedly I felt it was time to take some risk.  We've been talking about weed stocks daily, following and learning what we can.  His instincts (and luck) are better than mine and even though some might say that people should have been in on weed last year, we would beg to differ.  How anyone can believe that legalization isn't going to create some real long term winners, is crazy.  Heck, the short term day trading game is working great for some too.  Markets are down right now.  Check your balls and buy up some stocks in weed."

If you truly know what you are doing, read (and understand) research, think about where sectors are in the cycle, understand which companies in a sector are better run or have better assets, buy value and buy and sell with discipline -----  then you are investing. If you are picking stocks based on what someone else says they bought or without reading and researching, ---- you are gambling, not investing.  You might as well be ""investing"" in pro-line or go to Vegas. Back in the late 80's day trading got really popular because the markets had been on a long bull run.  The monkeys were making a little money day trading, thinking they were ""investors"".  I won't tell you how that ended.  Do your own research."
