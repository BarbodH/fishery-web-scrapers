1046244,Sketty55,2019-06-26 02:54:00,52,I live in Mississauga and often drive past 16 mile creek as it crosses Britannia (near Terra Garden Center) or on Lower Baseline\Trafalgar. I only fish bigger lakes but i always wonder what species are available aside from Salmon and Trout and where fishing is allowed along the river in Milton and Oakville. I don't see any signs posted in these areas mentioned above. Appreciate any guidance. Thanks!

Tons of easy ways to get down there.  Lions valley, the mouth of Lake O.  "
