1046072,Headhunter,2019-06-20 13:35:00,5703,My niece taught high school in Prince Rupert for a number of years. She had many first nations friends who would take her out with them... here's a pic of one of their catches... HH  
1046074,DanD,2019-06-20 13:59:00,2223,I'd be happy with just one to take home; but wouldn't mind practicing catch & release after that. LOL Nice haul for your niece and company! Thanks for posting the pic HH. Dan.
1046075,Headhunter,2019-06-20 14:03:00,5703,"Take a look at the large white coloured fish,those are Halibut. They come in the same way they lay on the lawn, sideways! Hence the dinner platter comment. Darker coloured fish are BC cod and considered a delicacy on the west coast. I won't bother posting the pics of their crab fishing adventures! Enjoy your trip Dan! HH"
1046077,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-20 16:46:00,8243,"Dan, you the Man. You must feel like you just won the lottery. Always wanted to fish British Calabria, it's on my to fish bucket list. My kid brother who can count on 1 hand how many times he fished actually fished the Fraser while visiting in-laws. Even he slayed the Cut Throat. Way to go Dan. A 100 tip for 2 days is fair, that is if you feel the guide did a great job. Not all guides deserve a tip but if they have a job at this resort they must be good. I always leave a tip for housekeeping the day I check in and the day I check out, as well and don't forget your servers and kitchen staff. Check with your fellow guests to see what they intend on tipping, if anything. I usually earmark 200 to 300 bucks for a week for tips, maybe too much but I know how tough it is working hospitality and they depend on tips to pay the bills. Usually working for minimum wages."
1046078,AKRISONER,2019-06-20 16:58:00,5558,"was blessed enough to spend some time salmon fishing in Haida Gwaii Needless to say that there is more than just fishing to do. Just a day in the boat is a bloody adventure. I remember sitting one day as we trolled along, I was staring at the snow capped mountains of alaska, while Whales, Porpoises and sea lions could all be seen. A really incredible place."
1046093,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-21 00:51:00,8243,"An oldtimer told us stories about his great fishing adventures and prowess from around the world. He said to get ready to catch Halibut out west the would tie a line to a refrigerator on 1 side of the house, go to the other side and try and reel it up and over the roof. Are you ready? Get to the gym bucko. I just read your by-line. I have a buddy from way back in high school that will serve  you anything you want at his home, that is as long as it's a Rusty Nail. By the time you are ready to leave you have to Uber ride home."
1046126,Rattletrap2,2019-06-21 16:15:00,1652,Enjoy Dan! Awesome trip of a lifetime! Congrats!
1046237,David Chong,2019-06-25 21:37:00,836,Great prize to win! Could be that trip of a lifetime!
1046474,DanD,2019-07-02 13:05:00,2223,"Just back from my BC trip and all I can say is amazing!!!!!! I cannot find one thing that I could complain about with Duncanby Lodge. The fishing again was amazing, I have no idea of how many chinook that I caught;  I lost count? Anything under 10lbs we released; along with anything above 30lbs (Called a Tyee)  due to their genetics of being that big. I was lucky enough to be on a boat where one of the guys landed a Tyee at 32lbs We were able to release it after about 10 minutes of hard work for it to swim away strong.  The lodge owner and guides were very pro catch and release of these large fish. To make it even more appealing they offer up a hand carved center pin reel to anyone that releases a Tyee.  My largest fish was 20lbs and all fight; it and the others came out of the water 5 or 6 times trying to shake the hook. Being barb less hooks just added to the fight. I have never fished with a center pin before; so it was also a bit of a challenge; but now I'm looking to buy one. We also fished for ling cod and rock fish (sorry no pics) . I was reeling in about a 3 lb rock fish and a ling cod grabbed it and had my fish half way down its throat by the time I landed them both. Here is one of the 20lbers that I caught. If anyone here ever is offered a trip to fish the West coast of BC; do not hesitate to go. Just amazing fishing. Dan.  "
1046475,lew,2019-07-02 13:12:00,12766,Fantastic Dan and good to hear the trip was as much fun as you'd hoped for.
1046477,Big Cliff,2019-07-02 13:24:00,6899,Trip of a lifetime ?
1046478,Terry,2019-07-02 13:32:00,14456,wow looks like a great trip
1046491,misfish,2019-07-02 16:02:00,29133,"Awesome Dan,just awesome. Glad you enjoyed your trip. So,when you going back ? LOL"
1046545,DanD,2019-07-03 10:48:00,2223,I'd go back in a heart beat; if I had that kind of money sitting around. 
1046727,BillM,2019-07-06 14:55:00,17367,"Dan, those mooching reels are a riot to fish!   Glad you had a good time!"
1046835,DanD,2019-07-09 11:28:00,2223,Just order one off of amazon. Hope it gets here before my trip up North? Dan.
1044117,DanD,2019-05-07 17:51:00,2223,"Just got the news about an hour ago. I won a spot to go fishing in British Columbia, at the Duncanby Lodge. Man am I ever pumped!!!!! Anyone that knows me; they'll tell you I don't get excited or I don't show it. When my sales rep from my main parts supplier, told me the news; I jumped up from my desk, ran over to her and gave her a big old hug. Don't know all the travel arrangements yet; other then we fly into Vancouver and then take a float plane to the lodge. We (other draw winners) leave mid June for four days. I've entered this draw for the last 6 years, (since it started) and never thought I'd actually win a spot. BUT I""M GOING TO FISH THE BC COAST!!!!!!!!   LOL!!!!!!! Here's a link to the lodge's website Duncanby Lodge Dan. NO HAPPY HAPPY DAN!   LOL"
1044118,Terry,2019-05-07 18:06:00,14456,Nice going you will have a great time
1044119,DanD,2019-05-07 18:09:00,2223,Thanks Terry 
1044121,lew,2019-05-07 19:17:00,12766,"Fantastic Dan, really great news !! Does the prize include airfare to BC and back ?"
1044122,DanD,2019-05-07 19:52:00,2223,"Yeah; whether we fly out of London or TO everything is included. A friend that went on this trip a couple years ago; said to only take tip money for the guides and any souvenirs you may want. Meals, beverages, rain suits, safety gear, tackle you name it it's covered. Not sure about booze; but I'm not going to fog any part of this trip (not to remember it) because of it. LOL I can't believe I'm going. My wife also did the happy dance when I told her. Not sure if it were for the same reasons though??? LOL On a side note Lew; what do you think is a decent tip for a guide (that you're pleased with) at this level of lodge? I have never and could never (with the wife's permission LOL) afford this kind of trip. I want to be fair and can afford a few hundred bucks per session; but want to be informed as to what is a ""normal/usual'  well earned tip? Dan."
1044123,irishfield,2019-05-07 19:58:00,26272,Do you get to take a gear caddy with you.. I'm not tooo busy!! LOL
1044124,misfish,2019-05-07 20:01:00,29133,"Nice score Dan  All meals and snacks, including house beer and wine"
1044125,DanD,2019-05-07 20:01:00,2223,Wish I could Wayne; it be good to have a friend with me.
1044126,misfish,2019-05-07 20:03:00,29133,A guy like bunk or Mike B would know for sure.
1044127,DanD,2019-05-07 20:06:00,2223,"OK I guess I can splurge and buy a few rusty nails for myself. LOL Bold and brown, the Rusty Nail is the kind of cocktail your grandfather might’ve sipped before dinner while leafing through “The Saturday Evening Post.” Invented in 1937 for the British Industries Fair trade show, the two-ingredient classic highlights Drambuie, a scotch-based liqueur flavored with honey, herbs and spices, the precise combination of which remains a closely guarded secret. What we do know is that the word Drambuie is derived from Gaelic, meaning “the drink that satisfies.” The same could be said about the Rusty Nail itself."
1044128,lew,2019-05-07 20:54:00,12766,"Can't really help you with the tip Dan, we only ever hired a guide once years ago and it seems to me we gave him $100 for the 2 days."
1044129,DanD,2019-05-07 21:00:00,2223,"That's why i asked you Lew; I truly respect your opinion. If anyone else would like to chime in, on what a reasonable tip is; please do. I'm cheap but do not want to disrespect a guide and his work to get us on fish. Dan."
1044130,BillM,2019-05-07 22:03:00,17367,"Oh man, this is a trip of a lifetime!!"
1044131,GBW,2019-05-07 22:05:00,8460,Congrats Dan!
1044169,lew,2019-05-08 20:03:00,12766,"Thanks for that Dan, very nice of you to say."
1044172,DanD,2019-05-08 20:51:00,2223,It's easy to say/feel when you're talking about a man like yourself Lew. Dan.
1044182,grt1,2019-05-08 23:53:00,638,"when I guided in northwestern Ontario we would consider 100 bucks for 2 or3 days a good tip  but I would think in one of the higher end lodges 50 a day would be in line with what the guides expect. also if you take them some goodies, like product samples ie: baseball caps or tshirts they would be tickled too. this  was when we were paid 100 a day by the lodge to guide."
1044185,Rizzo,2019-05-09 00:48:00,4754,congrats you will love it
1044202,Headhunter,2019-05-09 14:19:00,5703,Just wait until you hook up with a 100lb+ Halibut! It'll be like trying to reel in a 100lb serving plate from 150ft! HH
1044241,bigugli,2019-05-10 11:29:00,6138,Dream trip os a lifetime. Enjoy.                                                                                                                                                                 Now if only i could be so lucky.
1044254,FishFinder17,2019-05-10 14:24:00,139,"Congrats on the win! I was lucky enough to have a work trip to Sonora Resort in BC a few years ago - similar idea, fly to vancouver, take a float plane/heli jet in. We did a 6 hour fishing derby and it was incredible. The scenery is like nothing we have around here. Managed to catch a 15lb salmon and they cleaned and freezer packed it for me...took it home as a carry on and was still frozen solid when I got back to Toronto!  You'll have a blast - be sure to post some pics!  FF17"
1044306,DanD,2019-05-11 12:30:00,2223,Thanks FF17 I’m still spinning from the news. I know a number of other mechanics who have been on this trip and not a bad word from anyone. So far there are three guys that I know very well that are going this year. Makes for an extra bonus having friends along. Dan.
1046066,DanD,2019-06-20 12:09:00,2223,"I leave tomorrow on this trip; longest month of my life waiting.  Why I brought this thread back up; is that I'm looking for any tips on halibut fishing. Watched a bunch of videos and read a ton of articles on fishing for them; but would like to hear from anyone's first hand experiences?  I've done a lot of down rigging, here on Lake Erie. So the salmon fishing won't be as much a mystery to me; as what bottom bouncing for halibut is going to be. Dan.  "
1046069,Headhunter,2019-06-20 12:52:00,5703,It will be like trying to reel in a dinner platter from 150ft straight down Dan.... expect sore arms and shoulders. HH
1046071,BillM,2019-06-20 13:15:00,17367,Hopefully you're fishing mooching setups all week for salmon   Non of this levelwind garbage!  lol!
