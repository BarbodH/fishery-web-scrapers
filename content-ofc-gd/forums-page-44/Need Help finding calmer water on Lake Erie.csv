1046427,dave524,2019-07-01 00:14:00,4508,"Glad you had a good day,  you can go a long ways up river and it's an enjoyable cruise. I really only fished walleyes there and would get them trolling the deeper channels with worm harnesses years ago, recommended more on being a safe bet you could get out no matter the wind, but there is almost everything in that river."
1046429,GaraldT,2019-07-01 00:37:00,52,"Yes, sorry, I meant to say crap shoot for me lol i see tons of guys online on Erie have huge smallie days. I get so jealous. im learning winds now and taking lots of advice from you guys so eventually ill get the hang of it and know when to be out there to slay. Thanks for the tips!"
1046430,spincast,2019-07-01 00:43:00,3279,"Good news on the outing with your Dad, some solid info from along time member there - every one of those outings is worth a hundred solo trips.. As for your initial question -  hitting the big lake in an 18 ftr, its not a problem, so long as you are willing to invest a little time to learn what the water conditions will be like based on the available information  -- and respect the resource I hit both big lakes regularly with my 18ftr.  The internet has a ton of info. I like Windfinder personally. It misses once in a while, but not often. Learn what wind speeds and directions on your forecast site mean on the lake. And if you are going out on a day when a couple Ks change in the wind makes a difference to your safety - ask yourself why? If I have a west wind at 5k, and it doubles, or even triples, depending on where I am I know I don't have to worry. If it says 25k, there's other things to do with my life.   I also have a VHF, and at this time of year when the heat and humidity can drive storm cells up from nowhere in a flash I am listening to the weather channel, the anglers, and watching the lake and skys for signs I gotta get off. I have been chased off a couple times, so far, so good, an nothing serious or even white knuckle worthy. Just time to go.Have I pulled off for nothing more than once. Yup. But you only get one chance to do it too late.  Don't play games with the water - a fish ain't worth it. There are incredible fishing opportunities on the big lakes you can't get anywhere else around here. Just respect the winds, waves and water. If you are interested in Erie at this end, spend some time on the long point forum, or there are a few facebook pages that are pretty easily discovered or, send me a PM, and I'll take you out one day and we can chat."
1046431,GaraldT,2019-07-01 01:56:00,52,Will definitely look into those places.  thanks!
1046432,GaraldT,2019-07-01 02:02:00,52,"I got a lot to learn! I use that windfinder site now and noticed the areas in Erie that I wanted to fish were about 15mph today so I backed off and I understand things can change quick when you’re on the water, so I have to learn for signs to look for like you say.  thank you for your offer, I might take you up on that soon!"
1046451,GaraldT,2019-07-01 17:46:00,52,Hey guys is 12mph SW on Nanticoke safe enough today?
1046452,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-01 17:46:00,8243,"Fantastic you got out with your Dad. It wasn't even windy yesterday/ Windy is when there are white caps on the river, going upstream. You were on the wrong side of the dam for Bass GT. The section downriver of Cayuga to the dam is loaded with Smallies. I've never seen a Largemouth taken from the river. I'm not saying they aren't there I just haven't caught 1. The lake was boatable yesterday. Smooth as glass in the AM. About a 2 foot chop right now, perfect Walleye chop. I take it you only are able to get out on weekends. I haven't fished on a weekend for a few years. The launches around here is sheer entertainment, like going to the Zoo."
1046455,GaraldT,2019-07-01 18:30:00,52,"Ok I’ll try it out, taking the wife out for a few hours now, do you know a good launch there?"
1046461,spincast,2019-07-01 21:19:00,3279,"Port Colborne Buoy. Add it to the info from Windfinder. Gives you now versus forecast,  Add that to your personal experiences  from the lake. Understand how topography will affect the winds where you want to launch, and how far out you want to head.. Overtime you can predict pretty close what it is gonna be."
1046468,GaraldT,2019-07-02 01:04:00,52,"Saved it, thanks for the help!"
1046473,Squid,2019-07-02 12:58:00,1656,bellwood lake in Guelph.
1046481,GaraldT,2019-07-02 14:30:00,52,"So I launched off Main Street on the right side of the dam this time like you suggested and you were right, much better there. There’s a 30-35 foot drop right there. My wife used worms and caught a bunch of sheep head, one was about 7lbs, she was loving it, her first time fishing on a boat. Couldnt find any bass though but had a great day. thanks again"
1046482,GaraldT,2019-07-02 14:30:00,52,Gas motors allowed on there?
1046487,grimsbylander,2019-07-02 15:36:00,3016,Yes
1046493,Squid,2019-07-02 16:12:00,1656,yes the last time i was there.
1046543,GaraldT,2019-07-03 02:44:00,52,"I’ll definitely check it out, thanks. Noticed the last time I was out that my motor wasn’t shooting out water through the little hole so the engine wasn’t cooling. I did some tests but looks like it might be my impeller. I have to call a few shops tmw to see if they can fix it. I hope it’s not anything serious."
1046294,GaraldT,2019-06-26 21:46:00,52,"Ok great, thanks for the help. Ill definitely check this out soon!"
1046303,Mister G,2019-06-27 11:01:00,1429,"North winds might give you calmer waters but the fishing usually sucks......north winds come after a cold front has passed and put fish down and off the bite. Normal SW winds are good and really just about any south wind produces a good bite.... East winds fish bite the least while West winds the fish bite the best. Now the best for no waves is when the winds are blowing straight down, you can tell if these winds are blowing when the flag is hanging straight down.......LOL Get yourself a Weather Rock and you will never need the weather idiot again . . ."
1046311,GaraldT,2019-06-27 15:42:00,52,"I had to google weather rock. LOL but thanks for the info, really helping me out. I just wish there were some smaller calmer lakes not far from me that allow gas motors. It’s just hard hitting these big lakes with a bass boat. I know a bunch of smaller lakes but they all don’t allow gas motors which sucks."
1046319,dave524,2019-06-27 18:36:00,4508,"I'm not understanding the apprehension of hitting Lake Erie with an 18 footer with a 140 on the back , a 14 foot tinner with a 9.9 yes,  but your boat is very capable of a lot of days on Erie."
1046320,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-27 18:44:00,8243,"Sorry Gerald but the place you describe doesn't exist on Erie. We bought on the lakeshore 23 years ago and have lived here full time for 20. Long Point bay can turn in a moments notice. I wouldn't venture far in your Bass boat. We don't see many in the open lake. Long Point Bay yes for largemouth. I would suggest you boat and fish around the bay at Nanticoke. I suggested to a member looking for Smallmouth  Bass just last week to work the shoreline of Peacock Point which is a stones throw from Hoover's Marina in Nanticoke .  He slayed them. From Nanticoke you can venture out to 5 mile reef. You might find some local Walleye there but no Erie monsters, they are still in the eastern basin. Directly across from Selkirk Provincial Park not far from the east shore of Peacock is a spot called Westlawn. Not far from shore you might find Jumbo Perch in 8 to 12' of water. The folks at Hovver's Marina will direct you and sell you Emerald Shinners. The perch will no bite on anything else. Look at all your weather and wind sites and heed the. Windfinder.com and Sailflow.com are my faves. Be careful, especially for a novice boater with children aboard. In fact my best advice is for you is to NOT boat Erie until you are much more experienced and know your boat capabilities inside and out. Many an experienced boater has drowned in that water. 2 of which I knew personally a few years back, in Long Point Bay in fact.  IF I were you I would boat and fish The Grand River south of the Dunnville dam. There are fish and much, much safer conditions. Launch at Fishmasters in Dunnville."
1046321,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-27 18:51:00,8243,
1046338,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-28 13:01:00,8243,"If the wind predictions are less than 1 meter get out at dawn and plan to be back by 11AM at least. Or if you see the windturbines shift directions. A change in wind direction usually means she's going to kick up.. Going out in a SW wind is doable, coming back in a NW wind can be brutal and plan on getting wet. Get into the habit of wearing your PDF's 100% of the time. Invest in inflatables for the kids and yourself. I don't even realize it is on they are so comfortable, in fact have realized I still had mine on driving the truck home."
1046363,GaraldT,2019-06-29 01:01:00,52,"@Old Ironmaker thank you so much for all your help. I did not mention that I would never take my kids on Erie or any big lake just to be safe. I’m new at boating and would never risk the safety of my kids especially on water like that. When I do decide to bring them on a boat it will be a smaller, calmer lake further away like inland like the Kawartha Lakes you mentioned. Also, for me, I personally hate big choppy lakes but it seems that I have to drive at least 2 hours to get to a calmer, smaller lake to fish. When I do go out to Erie I also like to stay pretty close to shore. I don’t trust the winds and waves on my bass boat to venture off. I also always wear my vest when I’m on lakes this big. I’m also with at least one or two people. I would never ever go out on my own no matter how calm the water is there. I will check out Nanticoke and peacock bay though when I get a chance. Oh and I target bass the most but thank you very much for your help and advice. I appreciate it."
1046382,GaraldT,2019-06-29 17:47:00,52,"Does anybody know what would be the closest smaller, calmer lake from the Hamilton Burlington area? Don’t mind driving an hour or two."
1046384,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-29 18:07:00,8243,Your welcome GT. When all we had was a 12' tinny we fished Jordan Harbour. Never had choppy water there. I was in Hamilton then. It's about 40 mins down the QE. Good sized Large Mouth Bass were in there then and Perch. Good luck stay safe.
1046386,GaraldT,2019-06-29 18:21:00,52,"I wanted to go to the spots you told me on Erie tmw but the windfinder site is saying about 15 mph for tmw, don’t know how accurate that is. I looked up the Jordan harbour and it’s saying 15 mph as well with north west winds, is that too windy or is it a lot better there than Nanticoke ? i plan on taking my father tmw so want to have a good experience and not worry about controlling the boat so much from the wind. Also thank you so much for your help!"
1046387,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-29 18:25:00,8243,"I'm looking out the patio door right now at Erie, we live here as I mentioned. It's less than 1/2 meter chop, no white caps. But that is now, in a hour who knows. That's the nature of this water. 15 mph NW wind on Jordan is doable. It is protected by the Niagara Escarpment. I'll check Windfinder for here tomorrow, give me a few mins."
1046388,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-29 18:30:00,8243,Calling for NW wind gusts to 20 mph tomorrow here by 11AM. I wouldn't be going out on Erie tomorrow. Even in Nanticoke bay getting back to the Marina will be an adventure and you will get soaked without a full windshield. Don't forget when they predict a wave to be 3 feet or 1/2 meter that's a 6 foot swell from belly to crest.
1046389,GaraldT,2019-06-29 18:41:00,52,"Ya that would be too much for me on Erie tmw And when you say “doable” would that mean still being able to control the boat with the trolling motor in the Jordan harbour with 15mph or that’s pushing it? Also, where would the launch be for Jordan harbour? appreciate it! "
1046390,dave524,2019-06-29 18:55:00,4508,"Jordan Harbour is a no go. It has pretty well silted in and extremely shallow since the 80's. Campbell's Marina on the harbour side is long gone with the boat launch, the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority now has it and I'm not so sure that they even allow power boats there anymore even if there was a launch ramp.  The Grand River if you launch in Dunnville above the dam gives many miles of calm boating and various warm water species."
1046393,GaraldT,2019-06-29 20:55:00,52,Thanks for the info good to know. Is the water very shallow at the grand above the dam? Are there bass and where would the launch be? 
1046401,dave524,2019-06-30 02:36:00,4508,"I used to launch here , it was free and you can run over ten miles up to Cayuga, I targeted walleyes but there are bass , pike and panfish as well. edit : click on the satellite view in the bottom left and zoom out  "
1046402,GaraldT,2019-06-30 03:28:00,52,"Perfect, thank you very much!!"
1046405,cisco,2019-06-30 11:25:00,597,"Grew up in Kitchener. We never went to Erie since it was well known that going there was a crap shoot. Hit Owen Sound for bows/salmon, Port Severn area for pike and walleye, Rice for walleye. Never targeted bass but got them anyplace close to shore or along the Nith/Grand below rapids. To me the extra drive to waters you know are sheltered and safe is a better way to go about using your 18fter. Three times over the past 10 years I've hit Erie for fishing and only once was tolerable.  IMHO you pretty much have to live right there to take advantage of calm waters. To drive from Burlington to Lake Erie as a long term plan for open water fishing will involve way too many disappointments. Like said above the river is best but you should consider different directions than towards Erie. Be safe and all the best!"
1046413,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-30 16:35:00,8243,Wow I have to get out more Dave. What a difference 40 years makes! Yep it's been that long. It's too bad I loved Jordan Harbour in our little Sears car topper. Got some nice Perch there in winter too. I would say the Grand is Geralds best bet without driving through TO traffic. As far as depths of that river it changes. I know spots near the dam 30 feet deep. I have gotten hung up on sandbars that weren't there a few weeks before. That's the nature of rivers.
1046421,GaraldT,2019-06-30 21:53:00,52,Ya you’re absolutely right about Erie being a crap shoot. It sucks we have no smaller lakes around here that allow gas engines. Thanks for the help
1046422,GaraldT,2019-06-30 21:58:00,52,"So I ended up taking my dad to the Grand in Dunnville where @dave524 suggested and the water was great even though it was windy. Normal chocolate milk water but easy to fish in, deepest part there is about 10 feet. My dad caught a few catfish off worms but I struck out using my bass lures. I tried chatterbaits, jigs with craw trailers, jerk baits, drop shot some roboworms, crankbaits and a lipless too but couldn’t get a bite. Even got closer to shore where there were lily pads and threw a couple frogs but no luck. But still had a great day taking my dad out. "
1046423,lew,2019-06-30 22:46:00,12766,And that's what it's all about right there.
1046425,grimsbylander,2019-07-01 00:09:00,3016,"Glad you had a good day out with your Dad! I have to weigh in on the Lake Erie idea. First, going to Erie is not a crap shoot. Not if you take 5 mins and do some homework looking at wind forecasts. The good sites were already posted. Secondly, it’s not written anywhere that you have to run out to the middle of the lake to catch fish. You can catch smallies all day within a few hundred yards of the shoreline. In fact you can stay under 10 mins from the boat launch all day and still not go deeper than 15’ of water. I drive to the Fort Erie / Crystal Beach area and always plan my trip using a wind forecast. Don't be nervous and avoid the lake just because you’ve never been there. The people that get in trouble on Erie do so because they don’t respect the lake. No preparation, don’t know their limits, and don’t put safety first. Go and enjoy the lake! After a few visits, your confidence will go up and you’ll wonder why you waited. "
1046426,sauce,2019-07-01 00:11:00,219,Have you thought about belwood or conestogo lake? Both have bass pike perch crappies and walleye. I have been out on Belwood in strong wind and it only gets choppy in the open middle section. Both lakes have lots of protected shoreline to fish if the wind is howling.
1044394,GaraldT,2019-05-13 14:25:00,52,"Hi everyone, So this will be my first year with a boat, so excited. I was wondering if any of you can help me out and let me know where on Lake Erie to go for fishing with a little calmer waters? Ill be bringing my kids sometimes so want to be safe. I live near Burlington but willing to drive. Someone told me about a place called Sugarloaf Marina in Port Colborne but I have no idea if it’s any good. Spots that have walleye and bass when season opens up is what I’m looking for. Any help would be appreciated either here or PM’d.  Thank you so much!"
1044398,AKRISONER,2019-05-13 15:10:00,5558,niagara river man or watch the wind and fish it in a north wind.
1044402,GaraldT,2019-05-13 15:35:00,52,Any specific boat launch locations there? Thanks!
1044406,dave524,2019-05-13 16:21:00,4508,"Inner Bay at Long Point is somewhat protected. Bass , Pike and various pannies. Edit : grew up near Port Colborne and fished it since the early 60's, definitely would take Long Point over fishing inside the breakwall at Port Colborne. now, if you are willing to venture open lake on a good day, I'd take Port Colborne. "
1044410,grimsbylander,2019-05-13 17:59:00,3016,"You should include what kind of boat/size/power you and the kids will be in. Helps to define ""calm"" on Erie."

1044418,GaraldT,2019-05-13 19:13:00,52,"Sorry, you’re right. I have an older nitro boat, 18 footer with a mercury 140 engine. Definitely capable of handling the lakes but I’m new to boating and still learning a lot so just want to be safer especially when I’m with the kids."
1044421,grimsbylander,2019-05-13 19:35:00,3016,"Good to know. With a west, northwest wind you're good to go all along the north shore of Erie and there is no need to venture out too far for smallies. Lots to keep the kids happy in 15' of water."
1044422,GaraldT,2019-05-13 19:48:00,52,"Any locations specific. Sorry for my ignorance, Lake Erie is new to me. thank you for your help!"
1044424,grimsbylander,2019-05-13 19:57:00,3016,"Honestly, pick a spot based on where you want to launch. There are fish from the Niagara to Long Point...just go where it's convenient to you! Any marina or boat launch has smallmouth and perch within a 3 minute drive. Have fun!"
1044436,sauce,2019-05-13 21:31:00,219,"Grand river below dunnville dam. 8 or so miles of river to fish. Lots of sheepshead and enough walleye to make it worth fishing for them. If you are into catfish, you can catch bullheads and big channel cats. You also have access to Erie. Best part is that you can always fish the river if the lake is too rough."
1044446,GaraldT,2019-05-14 00:56:00,52,Got it. appreciate the help!
1044447,GaraldT,2019-05-14 00:57:00,52,Actually more into bass. Are there bass there? thanks!

1046272,LeXXington,2019-06-26 18:50:00,1928,"Lake Erie is a finicky lady -  I would stay within a few kilometers from a launch  until you get more comfortable.  She can blow up in a hurry and calm down just as fast. from the South is harder to hide from the waves. From the north its calm in shore (close to bass fishing) Really If I see the wind predicted to be over 20k, I pass.  "
1046274,Headhunter,2019-06-26 19:02:00,5703,"And I'll add to Lexx's comment, watch for in coming thunder storm, they can move pretty fast. HH"
1046281,Squid,2019-06-26 19:38:00,1656,If its a north wind you can launch out of port maitland on the grand where it meets the lake. Go out into the lake  in 15 feet of water or so and turn west. About one KM west there will be  a lot of large flat rocks. This area is where my young boys killed it so bad that they had enough fishing for the day. Jigging worms ( plastic too) or using small deep divers works very well. Good luck
1046293,GaraldT,2019-06-26 21:45:00,52,Appreciate the help guys. I have a nitro bass boat so any choppy water sucks. And it seems like Erie is known for this. i wish there was some close smaller calmer lakes that would allow for a big motor like mine. I know a few not too far from me but only smaller trolling motors allowed in them.
