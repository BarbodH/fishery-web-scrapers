1045918,seanmcd13,2019-06-17 15:16:00,1,"Hello everyone, I recently moved to Toronto from Winnipeg for the summer. I'm an avid bass fisherman and have been doing my research but would love some input from everyone. Does anyone have suggestions on bass fishing locations within a couple hours of Toronto that are accessible to fish from shore? Thank you!"
1045922,dave524,2019-06-17 16:14:00,4508,Port Colborne east to the mouth of Niagara River for smallies anyway.
1045926,BillM,2019-06-17 18:49:00,17367,I'd be fishing every pier on the north shore.
1045929,NAW,2019-06-17 20:25:00,4022,If you can get your hands on a canoe or kayak.. Pretty much every lake of decent size in this province will hold bass.  Just pick one and giver! I can't help you with the shore fishing spots though..  Welcome on Ontario! 
1045932,David Chong,2019-06-17 22:06:00,836,"Lots of access points in the Kawarthas for shore fishing but there is some pretty good bass fishing on the Toronto Islands, Grenadier Pond in High Park etc. in the city"
1045936,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-18 00:29:00,8243,"Fish the shore along the north shore of Lake Erie in Haldimand County. PM me and I will give you a few good spots. It was only last week I watched the males move along the shoreline looking for a good spot to make a bed. This is very late. They should have already had little Smallies by now on their nests, very late."
1046221,CharlieY,2019-06-25 10:21:00,3,Do you mind let me know which side of Toronto Island you’re fishing ? do you know any boat ramp around?
1046235,David Chong,2019-06-25 21:32:00,836,Ashbridges Bay has a nice ramp! You’ll have to get a Harbour licence to boat in the Toronto Harbour!
1046530,Cando,2019-07-02 22:12:00,90,My friend hasn't fished their in years but he said he use to catch bass at the park right at Kipling and Lakeshore. I don't know how good the fishing is as I haven't been there. Checkout a map for the Port Hope area. There are some good bass spots there according to one of my friends. Like a lot of others said. A lot of small lakes in the Kawartha lakes areas.
1047095,muskybw,2019-07-15 17:53:00,116,"i fished EAGLE,CRANBERRY in west guilford, on the 3 day weekend, lots of bass, few wally's."
1047096,CharlieY,2019-07-15 17:59:00,3,"@mushybw, you mean Gilford Beach? "
1047097,jimmer,2019-07-15 18:08:00,2730,West Guilford is not on lake Simcoe. It's about 2.5 - 3 hours from Toronto.
1047098,CharlieY,2019-07-15 18:15:00,3,thanks @ jimmer.  should be here: 
1047106,muskybw,2019-07-15 23:30:00,116,"i'm sorry for not say exactly, i was staying at Bushwolf lake, fished Eagle & Cranberry lakes, that are on the way 2 HALIBURTON via highway # 118. Eagle lake village, is on eagle lake rd., the lake is right there & Moose lake beside it ."
