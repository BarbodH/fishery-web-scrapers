1046960,Tjames09,2019-07-11 17:10:00,664,"This went sideways fast. Ranger makes all kinds of boats, mainly fibreglass but not necessarily bass boats. They make lots of deep boats for big water, along with deep v aluminum. And they make just as many multi species boats as bass boats, just because it says ranger doesn't mean its a ""bass boat""  I think he meant you don't see trolling rigs on a two seaters bass setup."

1047010,BillM,2019-07-12 16:18:00,17367,I'd love a Ranger 621S.  Drooooooooool
1047011,AKRISONER,2019-07-12 16:34:00,5558,"That’s more like what some people are now calling a “Walleye boat”  theres a guy up in pointe au baril in the fall that drives a nitro one. I’m pretty sure it’s even described as a Walleye boat and is marketed as such by nitro. they have a transom capable of mounting a kicker unlike a bass boat. If you’ve got a full windshield, it ain’t exactly a bass boat anymore. You are talking fiberglass multispecies then.That’s just my opinion."
1047013,misfish,2019-07-12 16:47:00,29133,"I will give you that one,but you missed the red one. Full blown bass boat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1047014,Terry,2019-07-12 16:50:00,14456,"Hell, I have downriggers and rod holders on my bass boat  and a kicker motor too"
1047030,grimsbylander,2019-07-13 01:53:00,3016,I'm with you on that Bill. Big water beast.
1047044,misfish,2019-07-13 18:35:00,29133,"Yup, he trolled right past me this morning. Guys got it rigged just right."
1046714,AKRISONER,2019-07-06 02:24:00,5558,Can we really trust guys that choose to fish that featureless puddle above all of the other lakes in Ontario though? I personally have never seen rod holders on a bass boat.
1046720,Sinker,2019-07-06 13:13:00,8692,"Again, close minded. You realize Erie is a world record class fishery, right? It even has world record sized bass for you. Some of the best anglers out there are running Ranger boats with more rod holders than I can count. Featureless bowl? Seriously? Dude, get out of your box. Precision trolling is an art that most will never understand. S."
1046725,craigdritchie,2019-07-06 13:53:00,1586,"Featureless? Seriously? It's pretty clear you haven't spent any real time fishing Erie, or you wouldn't say such a thing. There's a ton of structure and cover if you know what to look for. The lake is an amazing place to fish, especially if you like big bass. Not sure if they still run it or not but there used to be an opening weekend smallmouth tournament that ran out of Buffalo ... it was a two-fish limit and if you didn't have 12 - 13  pounds, you wouldn't even crack the top 10. The problem ... if you want to call it that ... was culling four and five pound smallies one after another, all day long, while trying to get a bigger limit. I can't think of too many other lakes in Ontario where you have that kind of trouble. Walleye fishing on Erie is legendary. It coughs up some of the biggest muskies caught in Ontario every year. Summer trolling for steelhead is mind-boggling, and the east end of Erie has some of the biggest lake trout this side of Nunavut. It has jumbo perch, big pike, some major slab crappies ... man alive, what more do you want? And yeah, Sinker is absolutely right - you see huge numbers of high-end bass boats out there that bristle with rod holders. Some of the US boats like like porcupines. If you've never seen rod holders on a bass boat, then you need to try fishing somewhere other than the Kawarthas."
1046728,grimsbylander,2019-07-06 15:01:00,3016,"The US side of Erie allows for multiple rods (2) per angler....hence the rod holders. That featureless puddle produces DOCUMENTED big tournament weights of smallies all summer and fall. As opposed to the unofficial we caught over 20lbs blah blah. You do it on a proper scale or it didn’t happen. For shear numbers and variety of gamefish, Erie is hard to beat. Though, Eastern Lake O and the St.  Lawrence is, in my opinion, right up there."
1046737,dave524,2019-07-06 18:37:00,4508,"Last I knew 2 rods were allowed if boating on Lake Erie and Erie is anything but a featureless puddle going out of Port Colborne inside of 40 or so feet of water, lots of reefs and shoals to take out a lower end many yards from shore, but yes once you hit the main basin outside of 40/50 feet of water the bottom virtually straightlines picking up only a few feet of water every mile or so out."
1046743,outllaw,2019-07-06 21:22:00,1232,"I am chuckling. I build baits. yes you can buy the 150 dollar beautys. most never use them. trolling a lure at 4mph the baits travelling 6-7ft per second. its about action,then a contrast feature. how many seasoned guys use chewed up everyday baits. as for fancy swimbaits,the juries still out. hookups are lo on the scale.."

It’s one of, if not the warmest of the Great Lakes? Resulting in increased metabolic rates and bigger fish. Wait did you just make my argument for me? Lol relax guys. You can have Lake Erie and share it with the Americans, enjoy! love the “get out of the kawarthas” comment. If I fished anymore lakes than I already do then I’d definitely lose my job and my girlfriend hahaha"

1046761,porkpie,2019-07-07 02:54:00,2521,"Things have changed Dave.  I’ve fished north and south shore Erie for many years.  Spent a fair bit of time steelheading on the south side in the glory days.  It’s always been a remarkable fishery, with some lean years here and there for both pickerel and steelhead.  I’m not sure when your last trip to Erie was, but it’s gone from good fishing, to holy crap I can’t believe it!  As I said, the good old days for walleye are right now for anyone wanting to get out there.  60 fish days are common place if you follow the fish and know what your doing.  You should hitch up that boat!"
1046762,AKRISONER,2019-07-07 02:57:00,5558,Is that your catch or someone else’s on a different forum. Either way that’s a solid day on the water. Forget the numbers that is some serious size.

But I do find it amusing that so many younger anglers, and bass anglers in particular, get totally sucked in to this whole ""newer has to be better"" marketing hype. If you want to blow $50 on a crankbait, hey man, fill your boots. The tackle companies will love you for it.  "

The old timers I fished with in the 80's went through the depression and WW2. They kept everything they caught and you caught as well. I remember Ozzie telling us whoever caught a big Pike keep it. He would stuff it with OOS Bass and Pikereye fillets and freeze it. I've seen him keep 10"" Largemouth Bass. If we had to eat meat from a bloated rotting dead horse on the side of the road as a Nazi POW we might keep each and every fish we caught too. They lived in a time we just cannot fathom. Dad was the last of the oldtimers in our Family, he passed this passed April just 4 days after his 92nd birthday. Reposo en Pacce Pa. Young fellas out here on Erie couldn't care if they caught a 8 pound Smallie, it's all Walleye and it all goes on the table. Never less than as many keepers in the freezer along with the Moose, Deer and Rabbit as allowed at any given time. Maybe less young Walleye anglers where you are Akri, not down here."
1046852,AKRISONER,2019-07-09 15:37:00,5558,"Same thing no? Grandpa was a 2nd generation canadian Uki and great grandma came from Warsaw when she was 13 after her whole family died from the spanish flu. Making me both, so its a double whammy The angling population up in my neck of the woods is weird. In a lot of ways it feels like it might fall of a cliff, or there will be a strange re-emergence. But thats purely for walleyes in the fall. During the late spring and summer its shocking how few anglers there are around. The only consistent angling traffic is driven by the local lodge, the only guys that seem to fish are people that actually live in pointe au baril and obviously that population is very very small. That area of G bay is just full of extremely wealthy American's that seemingly come up to the area to sit, drive around in million dollar boats and read on their docks while wearing big hats. Thats all they seem to get up to for the 2 months they spend a year on their private islands. They seemingly also pay the local contractors hand over fist to not have to do any of their own work at all either lol, Everything just seems to be ""done"" when they get there. Heck I wonder if they would even cook their own fish if they caught one...i doubt it lol"

Rail lines provided them transportation to and from and no, they don't like to do things themselves, they don't at home, why would they here? Nothing wrong with it, they helped pay the way to better infrastructure and jobs locally, which helped to open the the north. Let's not forget the taxes they pay. Where we take our vacation, the vast majority of the cottages are American owned. They are almost always empty. Makes for a nice quiet stay for us. Sorry for the off topic response.... I think musky baits are just swell! Especially the furry ones! HH "
1046916,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-10 21:10:00,8243,"1/2 Ukrainian and 1/2 Polish, that's some good stock you have there. I know many friends who's Mom's and Pop's were exactly that. Come to think of it my SIL. If I had the $$ I wouldn't lift a finger either. Maybe to polish one of my Ferrari's, maybe. Let's hope all that American money keeps coming here. A pal has a property with 2 nice cottages on it on a small lake somewhere near Point Au Baril. They slam the Walleye, Smallmouth and big Pike. All they do is fish, they never fished until they bought there. It's an adventure just to get to the place on the path they call a road. Then down the 45 degree hill to the cottages precariously perched on the hill. The 1st time my brother went he tore the exhaust system off his new Beemer. I thought I knew what bad black flies were. That is until I had to wear a face net to eat dinner, in the cottage. That is just crazy. I have politely declined an invitation a few times now. I will never disclose where, it could be fished out by a few boats that know how to."

1046641,dave524,2019-07-04 17:49:00,4508,"Years ago the MNR put them in the lake dad had a cottage on in Haliburton. None of the cottagers wanted them in a bass/pickeral lake, bunch got caught and none released, actually,  while not as good as walleye on the table they were on a par with the bass on the table, bony though and smaller than the crazy minimum size limits on some waters, maybe a slot limit for eaters would make sense."

1046644,lew,2019-07-04 19:23:00,12766,We used to have some great discussions here a few years back about keeping or releasing muskies and I don't think anyone ever won the argument LOL
1046645,grimsbylander,2019-07-04 19:35:00,3016,"I'll bet! Obviously, I'm joking about the eating part though I'm sure it happens and truthfully, that's personal preference. But they're such amazing creatures it's great to know most get to swim away."
1046646,AKRISONER,2019-07-04 19:38:00,5558,"lolll i dont know a single person under the age of 50 that would even consider eating a musky hahaha. not surprisingly it was that crazy polish guy Henry Waszchuk that had a musky recipe in his personal recipe book lmao. As Taro Murata said when he found out my family and I were polish but were cool with releasing the majority of our fish  ""I thought caught fish is polish steak"" I still honestly wonder what is going to happen to the fishing industry when all of the guys that grew up or lived in the 80's the era of actual fishing boats and the explosion of technique and target specific gear showed up on the market for the first time are gone. The mentality is just so vastly different. All you have to do is look at the guys that fish walleye up near my place every fall. The older guys grew up keeping everything have somewhat learned to let a few go from time to time, while the younger crowd may take one fish if they really care to filet it. Then you have musky fishing. There are definitely a few younger guys that are really into it, but when you are talking about the large majority of anglers under the age of 35, most are bass fishing these days, the population of walleye anglers is falling off of a cliff."
1046648,lew,2019-07-04 19:57:00,12766,I actually killed & ate the 1st musky I ever caught way back in the early 70's as that's just what folks did back then...unfortunately. I've caught & released many 100's of muskies in the decades since then but to this day I still wish I'd released it. I had it mounted and hung on the wall of my trailer for a very long time but then I gave it to a friend who owns a fishing camp up on Nippising who now has it hung in his office.  
1046650,Sinker,2019-07-04 20:06:00,8692,I feel there is a lot more musky fisherman now than ever. Is it just me? I see way more people fishing for them. Waaaay more. S.

Not saying they haven't caught fish however my best lures have been the believer, blades and bulldawgs. On the OP with musky fishing dying off with people under fifty, I disagree. When I goto the Kawarthas I've seen many young guys out there fishing musky."

When was the last time you rigged up rod holders on a bass boat? It can be done its not ideal. Thats what my aluminum is for."
1046699,misfish,2019-07-05 21:38:00,29133,"Wrong. Guys that fish Erie from bass boats,have rod holders rigged up. Do some research. I know,as I was on bass boats for 3 days on Erie with pros. Their set ups were very slick."

Not nearly as much as bass but there’s always been plenty of bass guys. Lots of walleye fishermen around here, too.  As for baits, most of my best baits just look stupid in the water and you wonder why a fish would go for it, yet they work."
1046564,AKRISONER,2019-07-03 14:32:00,5558,"So the other day im fishing with my buddy who likes to collect swimbaits for bass and it occurs to me...Why in the heck are musky fishermen still using such oldschool weird looking baits? For those not aware, there is a big movement in the bass industry especially amognst younger anglers that is simply called the ""swimbait movement"" Quite literally though, this same movement just does not exist in musky fishing. The oldschool baits, Yes...i get it, they work, Ive caught musky on blades and weird looking stuff, but ive also caught musky on big rubber paddle tails that to put plainly, just look like poop when in comparison to what we are seeing on the bass swimbait market these days. Am I on to something here? Is musky ""swimbaiting"" the next frontier? or is it deeper than that, is musky fishing dying off with the 50+ crowd and boomers? Is musky fishing just not as ""cool"" anymore? Whats your take on this?"
1046568,lew,2019-07-03 14:44:00,12766,"If it ain't broke don't fix it. I said it for years, you don't need fancy to catch muskies and some of my favorite baits were the ones with most of the paint worn off or the big spinnerbaits with hardly any hair left on them."
1046571,North Channel Cottages,2019-07-03 17:15:00,18,"Most of the lures look amazing because they need the people to buy them, it's like a shiny new car or polished tools."
1046572,BillM,2019-07-03 17:17:00,17367,"If you can find a swimbait that pushes water and makes as much commotion as burned Double 10 does, I'm all ears"
1046576,AKRISONER,2019-07-03 18:20:00,5558,"then you get exactly what I am talking about. Absolutely, you can go and throw a mister twister on a lead jig head and smack smallies, or you can go throw a jackall neko flick with a tungsten nail weight and gamaktsu octopus hook. Of course, if it ""aint broke dont fix it"" is the classic adage, its not as if people didnt catch bass in the days before JDM tackle and swimbaiting, but in the era of ""getting the edge"" its surprising to me that no one out there is making incredible looking musky baits? Maybe its simply due to the fact that theres really no such thing as a tournament industry that causes anglers to one up the next angler? A lot of talk about pressure as well has people coming up with all sorts of ways to rig baits to provide a ""different look"" I dont see this sentiment at all in the musky business. Kinda blows my mind to be honest, we are talking about one of the hardest freshwater fish to catch, yet no one thinks, hmmm maybe if we go with stuff that looks more realistic, i can get the upper hand or advantage?"
1046579,lew,2019-07-03 18:45:00,12766,"Not really sure what your talking about when you refer to ""incredible looking baits"" as there are so many different baits on the market you couldn't count them all. Many of them work extremely well and many just catch fishermen. I had boxes full of baits but I knew what worked for me on the waters I was going to be fishing on a certain day and time of day or night. As for muskies being the hardest fish to catch, that's more to do with the the skill of the angler in a lot of cases. In the Kawarthas they're relatively easy to catch when you know where and when to fish for them and getting multiple fish in a day is very common. For many years I kept a log and usually caught between about 80-100 fish per season and my best year was 115 fish in the boat not even counting the ones my fishing partners caught. One morning I went out at 7:30  and by 10:00 I'd boated 9 fish. Bigger bodies of water like the St. Lawrence or Nippising don't hold as many fish but if you know what your doing and where & when to go you can still do well. The ""fish of 10,000 casts"" is only for those that don't understand the fish."
1046580,BillM,2019-07-03 18:47:00,17367,"Lew, that log book going up on Ebay anytime soon?  GPS coords included?  lol!"
1046581,Weeds,2019-07-03 18:48:00,782,"Musky baits already cost a fortune. I can only imagine how much they’d be if they were ultra realistic. Musky (in my little experience) don’t really seem to care how a bait looks, more how it acts. Probably bass too but what do I know. I do see where your coming from but I think probably the majority of hardcore musky fishermen are indeed a little older and more likely to go with what is known to work already. Pretty sure you could find some highly realistic musky lures if you looked hard enough, just don’t think they are huge sellers and would probably set you back an arm and a leg"
1046582,AKRISONER,2019-07-03 18:50:00,5558,"the bass ones are musky size...and do costs an arm and a leg, doesnt stop bass fishermen though lol.  Some of the trout swimbaits coming out of california are $200 and up! for bass!!"
1046583,North Channel Cottages,2019-07-03 18:50:00,18,"I think your line ""hardest fish to catch""  is the key thing in all this. In my experience of owning this lodge(3 seasons) people are happy just to catch something and don't want to spend all day just for one even if it would be big. The no tournament scene definitely limits the muskie lure production as well, no big money behind this stuff unlike the bass market. Which is just fine in my opinion. Muskie fishing is a very niche market, we don't cater to the hardcore fishing guys as some lodges do but even after specifically advertising to muskie fisherman because our season opens earlier than Nipissing we had little interest. I think the younger generation or say the generation with kids in the pre teen stages also don't want to go out all day and maybe catch one. It's not very fun not catching fish of course for younger people."
1046584,Weeds,2019-07-03 19:06:00,782,"I defer to Lew, the man knows his stuff. Still have some of his old Suicks, tangled up in my musky ball. The ultimate lure, maybe 50 treble hooks intwined. A bit like a Rubik’s cube, a lot like the hellraiser cube. The potential pain involved in unraveling it is huge."
1046585,Tom S,2019-07-03 19:21:00,362,"I think it has to do more with market forces than anything. Muskie-sized baits are a niche thing already, much smaller market than bass-sized baits. There may be a niche within the niche for super-realistic muskie baits, but it's not something a larger-scale manufacturer will pick up. More likely out of someone's garage. Also, the bass angling market is geared towards people looking for fast action, large numbers of fish. They're told they need the edge with the latest and greatest of boats, electronics, baits, and tactics. Muskie anglers tend to be the opposite - they realize they'll have a lot less fish but will patiently wait for the ones that are worth it. They could spend the whole day without a follow. That mentality is going to lend itself to throwing proven baits in situations where you know it's going to work."
1046586,BillM,2019-07-03 19:38:00,17367,"Guys are paying a lot more then that for muskie baits, especially ones that are discontinued."
1046589,misfish,2019-07-03 20:14:00,29133,"Think I made about 60 casts to get my first 2 Lew. Then again,they were just 30"" fish. Nothing big. On medium size spinner baits."
1046595,AKRISONER,2019-07-03 21:34:00,5558,"my first muskies were accidentals bass fishing, but my first ""real"" muskys definitely took a lot of casts and they were on pigeon lake. It was worth it though. That first 40+ fish 46 to be exact made my sore ass arms feel better in no time lol. Funny i caught it on the last cast of the day after casting blades all day for 8+ hours too."
1046596,porkpie,2019-07-03 21:55:00,2521,"I know walleye guys that have 6 special mates filled with multiples of custom painted cranks.  A couple boxes deeps, couple boxes mids and shad baits, couple boxes of shallows.  Each box maybe a couple grand all in?  I have a fair Arsenal of tackle including some custom stuff, and more tied up in rods and reels than I want to admit.  But theirs no way I’m stepping over the edge into that abyss.  The minute tournament is mentioned, guys go off the deep end.  Mega imaging, huge screens, boxes of tackle that would make a small independent shop jealous, trolling motors worth more than a used car.  They need something to spend money on, and guys are gadget crazy to begin with.  I don’t mind it, your going to have some sort of hobby and may as well keep the fishing industry healthy!  But anyone that thinks they need these ultra lifelike lures and all the other stuff that comes with it in order to catch fish,  bass, musky, pickerel or otherwise is fooling themselves so they can really sell it to the better half!  Some of it for sure makes it easier by a landslide, gps, gps trolling motors.... I’m like an addict for that stuff, I literally need it now and get pissed off if I have malfunctions lol.  You can’t take it with you!"
1046617,AKRISONER,2019-07-04 02:28:00,5558,"ill admit, im a bit of a nutcase when it comes to tackle, yes i use $30 lures to catch bass and rods...too expensive than i care to admit lol.  But all of that I thought was crazy until i bought my bass boat. just a game changer when it comes to dropping cash. Believe it or not I used to catch bass out of a 14 foot tinner with a retrofitted casting deck and a basic minkotta power drive...but lets get serious ripping across the lake at 100kmh and seeing clouds of bait on down imaging just makes everything more fun. I seriously wonder though, is the musky and perhaps even the walleye industry a dying breed as less and less people are catching to eat regularly? I personally think that the boat industry is on a course of destruction with the prices of boats these days. Yes i get it, the boomers have a pile of money and equity that they gathered while things were good, but for a 30 year old, owning a 100,000 bass boat while houses start at a half million dollars is a pipe dream. Not sure what the future holds, but I think the fishing industry is in for a massive massive change in the very near future, infact in a lot of ways I think it has already started with it really showing in Canada where walleye and pike ruled for a long time, and now people are thinking more about fishing bass. Can you blame people though? Id rather catch 10 smallies over walleye any day of the week. Talk to anyone my age that fishes and only a few have the patience to fish musky, and even then its a ""special occasion"" type deal. Maybe our attention spans just arent of that of our predecessors"
1046623,singingdog,2019-07-04 11:32:00,1047,I have fished musky with ultra-realistic lures and they just don't produce like traditional lures. I have some absolutely beautiful glide baits and jointed swim baits that just don't get follows. I have a couple of custom painted lures that look like they are breathing. A bumblebee or strawberry (2 of the weirdest paint jobs in the world) believer will outfish them everytime on my waters.
1046625,lew,2019-07-04 12:04:00,12766,"2 of my most productive lures ever were Bumblebee. One was a 10"" Believer that I removed the rattles from and the other was a Double ""D"" twitch bait that I hand painted. Strawberry Sledge was another great bait that also put many nice fish in my boat. Both incredible colours for sure."
1046626,woodenboater,2019-07-04 12:29:00,2277,"kinda going OT here, but since it was semi-mentioned here... What if someone held a tourney, no graphs and maybe 5-10 lures. Each boat has the same set of cranks/spinners etc.. But back to muskies. I think the younger gen of musky hunters are not digging the forum thing, instead they're all over Insta and FB. There's a cohort of younger women that throw huge arse streamers on sink tips etc.. Otherwise as everyone said, marketing, and bass fishermen are drawn to shiny objects, so to speak."
1046627,craigdritchie,2019-07-04 12:45:00,1586,"There are basically two types of anglers in the world. There are those who like to catch fish. And there those who like to spend money on gear. You see it in every segment ... bass fishing ... steelhead fishing ... fly fishing ... saltwater ... and yes, muskie and walleye fishing. Frankly, I couldn't care less if a muskie bait looks terrible or not. Does it catch fish? To me, at least, catching fish matters far more than appearances or keeping up with whatever some marketing campaign says I can't possibly live without. "
1046631,Sinker,2019-07-04 13:27:00,8692,"I""ve had the same musky lure on since last season, and still using it. Last year I got 61 musky, this year so far I have 13. How many have you got on the fancy, lifelike, glitter rigs that cost a fortune?? Simple is usually more effective. Just because It costs more doesn't make it better. That said, i think you are out of the loop on custom musky lures. There are PLENTY of custom lure makers who make some beautiful gear, and no, its not cheap. Generally bass guys, and musky guys are two different breeds, that don't really mingle well in most cases.  I don't buy much of my musky gear at tackle shops. Most is ordered, straight from the lure maker, in the colours and patterns I want made.  S."
1046634,JoshS,2019-07-04 15:14:00,729,"I kind of get what you are saying.. the innovation in musky lures doesn't keep up with bass etc, but it doesn't make sense for it to come close if you think how much smaller the market is. The musky sector has grown however a lot recently with a lot more anglers getting into it and some lure innovation from both manufacturers and customer bait makers. There have been a good handful of swimbaits introduced recent years and a swimbait ""movement"" maybe relative to bass if you consider the breadth of the musky market compared to bass. Musky swimbaits didn't really exist prior. There has also been explosive popularity in custom baits as of recently. So it's there just not to the same level as the bass industry nor should it. Not sure I would like that to be honest. And it's very true that the old proven baits consistently produce."
1046636,aplumma,2019-07-04 15:34:00,6896,"I have fished for muskies with some of the finest musky friends and guides and I still have a perfect record of zero. I have beat them all using all kinds of old school lures. I will watch them  cast or troll there second best lures after making sure they have giving me the best in the boat. I always win , they usually are letting me cast first to the choice spots and willing the fish to attack but I have a secret weapon it is anti musky magic. I am not sure any lure no matter how good it looks will increase the odds of me catching a musky. I still say to all of those people who have tried to make me catch a musky Thanks it is always a pleasure to spend time with my friends in a boat talking and fishing. Art"
1046638,grimsbylander,2019-07-04 17:10:00,3016,"Doesn’t matter what you catch a musky on, they still taste lousy."
