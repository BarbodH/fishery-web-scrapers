Bass is offically on fire now as well.  Small mouth is king here as there are millions of them.  My best friend with her first walleye of the year and the first in the boat this year.  She was mad I cut her face our of the the picture.  I think she understands now that its all about the fish not the person. hahahaha  My son with his first fish of the year.    My buddy with a smaller table sized fish   First Pike was very late this year coming well into June.   some good fish.   e Yes Im throwing a pic of my girls on this thread cause well they are amazing fishing partners.    Last night water crept up on some parts of the lake to 74.  I was on the water at 6pm and didnt get a bite till 910pm.  However it was fast and furious then died down to nothing at 10pm.  I got into some good walleye, some small bass and smaller walleye (good sign to see the small ones). Maybe about 10 to 12 fish all right after each other minus a ten minute battle with a treble hook in my rubber net (only me I tell you). So the fish look way bigger than they are in this pic.  They were both 17.5 inches and just shy of 2lbs.  I let the bigger ones go right away so didn't get pics as the action was fast and I didnt want to take time taking pics for them unless it was a true trophy.  For me I let anything go over 3lbs (unless deep hooked) and keep the smaller ones for the table.   I will end with this shot from last weekend.   I had a 10 minute boat ride back right into this beauty of a sunset.  What a night! "

I think people are letting a lot more go back these days too, especially the big ones and its having a major impact. With the slot of G bay we never keep overs anymore. 15 inchers are the best table fare anyways. smallie season is indeed upon us and holy cow was it on fire on opener. Some absolutely epic remember for the rest of your life type days."

1046591,misfish,2019-07-03 20:19:00,29133,Real nice pic of the sunset. Fish and smiles to boot.
1046618,Cando,2019-07-04 03:26:00,90,"Nice fish. Good to see the area is coming alive again. When I use to fish up that way, well over 20 years ago, the commercial net fishing almost killed the area I fished in. The did get rid of the commercial fishing nets and did a restocking but I haven't been back in over 20 years. We use to pull up the nets and release all the healthy walleye, pike and bass. They where suppose to release those fish but we all know thy wouldn't."
1046647,AKRISONER,2019-07-04 19:41:00,5558,talking to my neighbor thats lived in the area since the 50's the fishing now is the best it has ever been in his life. Thats really saying something.
1046661,lunkerbasshunter,2019-07-04 22:36:00,2585,That is amazing to hear.  I had a similar story here today.  The guy has been fishing this lake since he was a teenager and showed me old pics of stringers of huge 8-10lb fish.  He realizes that back then was the reason why fishing was depleted quickly.  Anyway he said this year has been the best year he has had in 30 for numbers so that’s very promising. Now water temps are up to almost 80 from 74 a couple days ago so wonder if that slows things down a  bit? I’m heading out this evening to find out! Cheers
1046662,lunkerbasshunter,2019-07-04 22:37:00,2585,Thanks sunset and sunrise is my favorite time to be on the water.  No traffic fish are biting and the views are amazing! Cheers
1046779,Cando,2019-07-07 21:01:00,90,That's great to hear. We caught some pretty big and a lot of fish when we fished there.
1046781,AKRISONER,2019-07-07 22:15:00,5558,"Can’t wait to get back up and get back on em, even with the heat they are still eating, just a little deeper."
