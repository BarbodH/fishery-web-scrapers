Thanks! Hook_settr"

1046247,Squid,2019-06-26 11:12:00,1656,Yeah fish for muskies.
1046253,bigbuck,2019-06-26 12:46:00,2449,"Great smallie fishing, great walleye fishing, great pike fishing, great muskie fishing.... LOTW has it all in spades. Have fun, I'm jealous, it's been 10 years since I was up there last."
1046258,BillM,2019-06-26 14:28:00,17367,I'd toss nothing but topwaters all day.
1046339,Sinker,2019-06-28 13:08:00,8692,"Theres smallies in there? Why go there for bass? I will never understand bass fishermen. You know LOTW has muskie, right? And walleye? And pike? I spent a week up there in 2017. Didn t catch any bass. I was in the nestor falls area.  S."
