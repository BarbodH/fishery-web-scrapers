1046411,Rod Caster,2019-06-30 14:52:00,5784,Very toxic to aquatic life. Basically vaporizing pesticides. From the MSDS 3. HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION This pesticide is highly toxic to fish. Do not apply directly to water. Drift from treated areas may be hazardous to organisms in adjacent aquatic sites. Harmful if inhaled.
1046433,captpierre,2019-07-01 02:26:00,2521,Kinda like my bucktail jigs ?
1046434,pics,2019-07-01 02:35:00,1268,The spray I got is for horses and says that it is toxic to fish as well as people...
1046488,JMFJMF,2019-07-02 15:43:00,18,"Sorry for the delay in responding, I was away from my computer. Unfortunately I misplaced the item and have been unable to find it so I can't honestly give you a quote. But they seem to be available in stores for around $30. When factoring in shipping cost, I am not sure it makes much sense to buy used ones."
1046517,Fisherman,2019-07-02 20:31:00,7201,No problem I've got one. 
1045448,captpierre,2019-06-05 02:16:00,2521,Mosquitoes bad this year. Likely to do with all the moisture. The reviews are mostly positive on the Thermacell units. Butane heats a pad that gives off a repellant. Not so good in the wind unless you put up wind of where you are. What’s the scoop?
1045449,smitty55,2019-06-05 02:22:00,928,"Pretty well every post I've ever seen on those units has been positive, whether sitting out on the deck in the evening with the lads or out in the boat anchored on a shoal. If it's calm they work well.  Cheers"
1045451,desship,2019-06-05 11:56:00,96,Works great with no wind.
1045452,woodenboater,2019-06-05 12:42:00,2277,"found them pretty decent but after a season, the igniter button on the portable-ish one, stopped working. I like the larger boxy one as it's also a battery powered area light"
1045466,big guy,2019-06-05 16:32:00,414,"Very good, will clear my 18 x 30 garage in 10 minutes when I place one unit in the middle of it. Work great as well when placed behind us when having a backyard fire. When camping, usually place 2 on either side of the main activity area and they make life so much more enjoyable. Highly recommend. Canadian Tire now sell the unit that fits on a butane cylinder, supposed to give you 140 hours of burn time."
1045467,Fisherman,2019-06-05 16:41:00,7201,"What the others said,  I put mine under my lawn chair by the fire, keeps the little buggers away."
1045508,bigbuck,2019-06-06 12:41:00,2449,"They definitely help. Used MIne for years while still fishing on Gbay. Still have it at the cottage and thanks for reminding me, I need to grab some pads and fuel cartridges for it."
1045509,BillM,2019-06-06 12:55:00,17367,"If there's no wind it will work fine.  If there's wind, forget it."
1045511,Terry,2019-06-06 13:01:00,14456,The good thing is the more wind the harder it is for bugs to bug you anyways
1045514,Sinker,2019-06-06 13:13:00,8692,I swear by it. It really does work. S.
1045525,smitty55,2019-06-06 16:30:00,928,I haven't checked this out personally but I heard you can get similar butane cartridges made for portable hair curlers for a lot cheaper at places like Walmart.  Cheers
1045559,fisherman7,2019-06-07 15:49:00,325,Love mine!
1045561,captpierre,2019-06-07 16:24:00,2521,Bought this at CT. $70.  Comes with cartridge that lasts 12 hrs. Rechargeable lithium battery. Rather than the other units that use butane. Can buy a cartridge that lasts 40 hr for $30. Will let y’all know what I think. Stay tuned.  
1045566,Oggie,2019-06-07 19:04:00,588,"I really like mine for keeping the ankle bitters off when I'm in the boat. The repellent seems to sit nicely in the bottom of the boat, right where the ankle bitters like to sit!  My spaniel thinks it's awesome because she gets hammered under the console unless the thermacell is on."
1045660,David Chong,2019-06-10 18:49:00,836,"Great to see these comments, looks like I'll have to get one!"
1045823,Pigeontroller,2019-06-14 02:17:00,2793,"French River Muskie trip coming up, I'm getting one!"
1045984,bigbuck,2019-06-18 13:54:00,2449,The Thermacell cartridges ARE the same as those that go into the butane fueled curling irons. They are made by and labelled Thermacell so that is kinda cool. I have found that I ran out of fuel before running out of mats. A 2 pack of cartridges is 10 bucks at Can Tire or Amazon.
1046020,JMFJMF,2019-06-19 13:31:00,18,"I found it to be similar to mosquito coils or a repellent candle, but I have been disappointed by the very high cost of running the unit so I retired it. I will try to sell it. Hopefully a rich guy with plenty of money to throw away will take it."
1046262,Freshtrax,2019-06-26 15:50:00,2215,mine works wonders while hunting.
1046270,Fisherman,2019-06-26 18:37:00,7201,Well how much?
1046322,bassboy19,2019-06-27 19:29:00,15,"They work great, wouldn't be out camping without them."
1046345,mamona,2019-06-28 14:18:00,597, Any links? The original cartridges seem to be very expensive.
1046367,Hack_Fisherman,2019-06-29 02:04:00,720,Definitely on my pick up list. I didn’t know these existed
1046368,Fisherman,2019-06-29 02:11:00,7201,"Check any pharmacy or Walmart, here too, https://www.amazon.ca/Conair-tc2bc-Butane-Refill-Cartridges/dp/B00006ISER"
1046410,Joeytier,2019-06-30 14:11:00,3990,"Don't expect them to do anything for horseflies and the like, but they work excellent on mosquitos."
