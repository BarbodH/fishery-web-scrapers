1046263,mamona,2019-06-26 16:27:00,597,"I have a small puzzle. I need to replace oil filter in my Tohatsu. 	Dealer says to go with original ones. Sure, no problem, the thing is they are not available in Canada What replacements would you guys recommend? 	This page lists a few, I am just not sure which one would be best https://www.tohatsu.com/accessories/oil.html "
1046269,Fisherman,2019-06-26 18:33:00,7201,"Amsoil EAOM103,  WIX 51365 or any of the Yamaha 13440 series.  WIX will probably be the cheapest but good quality. Any of the Honda 15410 series also fits,  easy to get at any motorcycle shop.  Avoid FRAM like the black plague."

1046275,mamona,2019-06-26 19:02:00,597,"@Fisherman, thank you so much! Fram seemed to be the only available (Canadian Tire)... all other ones way overpriced on Amazon 	It looks like I may have Amsoil dealers nearby. They may not have the filter in stock though... Damn, I would love replace it before damn weekend. 	Any ideas where else I could try to find them in Mississauga area?"

1046279,mamona,2019-06-26 19:32:00,597,"Tried to call them, I could only leave a message. Hopefuly they will call me back. 	All the shops seem to be too busy to pick the phone."
1046282,mamona,2019-06-26 20:05:00,597,"Any idea if WIX 51365XP will fit? https://www.amazon.ca/Wix-51365XP-WIX-Oil-Filter/dp/B00C5TCEMG/ Or Sierra (pricier a bit) https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004DX1KC2/ Calling all shops around, no luck so far. 	What if I changed the oil now and the filter after the weekend?"
1046283,misfish,2019-06-26 20:19:00,29133,"How many hours do you have on it ?  If it,s just for the weekend,I wouldn't do anything. JMO"
1046284,mamona,2019-06-26 20:24:00,597,"I have no clue how many hours, it seems like 20HP does not show. Thing is I already drained the oil. Then got busy with damn filter."
1046286,misfish,2019-06-26 20:28:00,29133,"You just got this motor then ?  Top with oil and go.  Worry about filter next weekend.  What is your location ? I will do some searching as others have. And, if you really want a filter, go with the fram for the weekend, but get rid of it tootsweet."

1046288,mamona,2019-06-26 20:33:00,597, Yes. I was not just sure if it is a good idea to replace the filter a bit later than the oil.  I am in Meadowvale area. Thank you for your help!
1046289,misfish,2019-06-26 20:38:00,29133,Call all the walmarts in your area.LOL

1046299,TennesseeGuy,2019-06-27 02:23:00,957,"Take your used filter for comparison, and a cross reference chart to your Mercury dealer. Tohatsu manufactures 20 hp mercury 4 cycle. I get my 20 hp Tohatsu oil filters off the Walmart shelf. "
1046301,mamona,2019-06-27 03:07:00,597,Thank you guys for all the tips.  Powersports was not picking up the phone at all. And not responding to messages. It looks like they are my the only hope! Lucky you! I hope I will share similar experience once I figure all crap this out.
1046327,TennesseeGuy,2019-06-28 01:09:00,957,"FYI:   You can order a Tohatsu from a U.S. dealer, have it delivered to General Delivery near border, no tax, free shipping.  Work out the sales tax in Canada and own a great outboard motor at a very competitive price. Or buy a Mercury 30HP and under that's the same thing, but higher price. Paid for mine with check, rather than cc and got a 2% discount.  "
1046329,Fisherman,2019-06-28 01:29:00,7201,"Seriously, with the money exchange rate that would be the last thing I'd do. Secondly,  a lot of manufactures will not honour warranty across the border, then you'd have to take it al the way bad, not a chance."
1046331,mamona,2019-06-28 02:23:00,597,"I would like to thank you everyone for the help. Dealing with Amsoil warehouse was an amazing experience. Very professional service, including having access to a specialist who was recommending filter options. Everything over the phone. 5min later my order was placed and ready for pick up. Ended up buying Amsoil EAOM103, which seems to be excellent choice. My motor is finally ready for the weekend! Thank you guys."
1046350,TennesseeGuy,2019-06-28 15:54:00,957,"What is your cost (Canadian Currency) for a 20 HP, electric start, 4 cycle, Mercury? About warranty, Tohatsu manufactures a great share of all outboard motors. Several years ago I looked into purchasing a new Honda Odyssey in Canada.   Seems the only way was to have a Canadian friend make the buy, keep it 6 months and turn over to me.   Would have paid both Canada tax and U.S. tax.   Wouldn't have been worth the effort."
1046352,Fisherman,2019-06-28 17:28:00,7201,"$3544.00 CDN, add another 30-35% for exchange."
