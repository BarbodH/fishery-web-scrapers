Many great prizes the past couple of years doing the king of the drift. I taught him everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, NOT LOL  Thanks pal, hope yer getting out."
1046904,Rattletrap2,2019-07-10 16:05:00,1652,"WOW! That is fantastic! But coming from such good fishing genes, it was inevitable that this would happen!"
1046905,misfish,2019-07-10 16:24:00,29133,Thanks Mr.B.
1046914,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-10 20:52:00,8243,"I once had my middle finger of my right hand amputated at the top knuckle in a industrial accident. Comp awarded me 3 grand in a payout, I'm left handed. I wanted to buy a 14' tinny and a 9.9. Before I found the boat she spent it on drapes and vertical blinds. I went fishing a few months later and never came home. That was exactly 30 years ago and my finger still hurts."
1046917,SirCranksalot,2019-07-10 21:18:00,3291,"So if you had said ""I got a boat for my wife"" I'd say ""Good deal""??"
1046920,SirCranksalot,2019-07-10 21:22:00,3291,"You mean as in ""I showed him everything I know and he still don't know nuttin'"" ??"
1046921,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-10 21:22:00,8243,"If I had the money the Judge awarded her I could have a great big boat, and a cottage. That was then and this is now and I couldn't be happier."
1046923,SirCranksalot,2019-07-10 21:24:00,3291,My first marriage lasted nearly 20 years but it felt a lot longer with the wind chill factor!! 
1046924,misfish,2019-07-10 21:26:00,29133,"He will out fish me on the rivers now. He is up to snuf. Then again,I do have a couple of flys up my sleeve."
1046925,SirCranksalot,2019-07-10 21:29:00,3291,The flies are no good up your sleeve---you gotta tie them on the end of your line!! 
1046932,akaShag,2019-07-11 00:48:00,2073,"John Slade, RIP indeed.  I fished with him a number of times, what a great guy! Doug"
1046933,dave524,2019-07-11 00:59:00,4508,"Everyone that steelheaded back in the 70's/80's knew of John, one of the founding members of the ""Ontario Steelheaders"" and one of the best outdoor writers on the subject of Steelheading. Always enjoyed talking to him, passed too early last summer. "
1047058,Fish Farmer,2019-07-14 10:49:00,2234,"Great news Bro, happy for your son.. Don't get on here much anymore, follow a few other sites from my area."
1047154,Cando,2019-07-17 02:39:00,90,"Congrats to your son. I use to go down to the boat ramp in port credit every night with Timmies in hand and watch them bring in the fish. I haven't been down there in a few years, but I don't think they can launch their boat there this year. At the start of the berby, the water was still halfway up the parking lot. "
1047160,misfish,2019-07-17 09:44:00,29133,"Bluffers is no different. Water is in the lot there as well. He got another nice one on the weekend, "
1047183,Cando,2019-07-17 17:32:00,90,Wow that one didn't make the top 10 or can you only win 1 prize. I haven't fished the derby much. Just once when we went on a charter but the lakes was too rough and our day was cut too short. The old saying when the wind come from the east is when you catch the least.
1046729,misfish,2019-07-06 16:40:00,29133,Boy oh boy. Dat me boy. Nice fish me son.  Just under the 30 lb mark.    http://greatontariosalmonderby.ca/daily-updates/

1046733,BillM,2019-07-06 17:00:00,17367,"Man, I remember when the winning fish was a few lbs over 40 as a kid.   Let's hope he can get some $$$ out of that thing!"
1046734,misfish,2019-07-06 17:04:00,29133,"He won the weekly 10 g,s Bill Talking to him this morning,he was pretty burned out. His cell never stopped.  "
1046736,Headhunter,2019-07-06 18:31:00,5703,Awesome Brian! Congrats to all! HH
1046739,dave524,2019-07-06 19:26:00,4508,"Congrats to him ?, me too Bill, my best was a oz or so shy of 35 back then , I watched as it slowly dropped on the weekly leader board till it finally won a couple of bulk spools of Blue Stren in the old Star Derby, think it was '86 , the same year John Slade RIP. won it and I had to pass that prize winning boat and truck every day on the way to work ?"
1046740,misfish,2019-07-06 19:57:00,29133,Wish I caught a $1 laker today.LOL
1046741,lew,2019-07-06 20:07:00,12766,"Outstanding Brian, really nice to hear !!"

1046746,porkpie,2019-07-06 22:16:00,2521,"Congrats to your son, that’s pretty awesome!  Make sure he takes you out for dinner!!"
1046748,AKRISONER,2019-07-06 22:49:00,5558,"Bill as sad as it is, tyee on the west coast used to be 50lbs as well and now it’s 30. That’s an insane difference!"
1046755,glen,2019-07-07 00:47:00,2641,Great fish.   Wtg Brian’s son. Do they post the details or do you have some.
1046756,glen,2019-07-07 00:50:00,2641,I found in the link it says caught on a flasher and fly.  
1046770,misfish,2019-07-07 16:03:00,29133,"Ya I was like,that's old school and still working. Take note AK. LOL After the inspection of the fishes inners ( to clarify no cheating of adding weight ) it was confirmed he was indeed the big weekly winner.  He is also qualified for the 4 hour shoot out at the end of the derby.The fish was on ice,so all the meat was still good. He said it had a real nice orange color to it. He shared with the other half's family and  I will be smoking the tail section of meat. Sure hope I don't mess up a $10,000 salmon. Maybe make a sign for out front. FOR SALE SMOKED SALMON. $344 LB."
1046773,Rustic-Fisher,2019-07-07 16:53:00,826,Awesome stuff Brian !!!
1046802,Sinker,2019-07-08 20:19:00,8692,When I saw the name on the leader board i wondered. That's awesome!!! He must be just stoked!! Good for him!!  S.
1046803,Terry,2019-07-08 20:28:00,14456,so your kid gets 10 thousand bucks and you get a piece of tail interesting
1046804,Old Ironmaker,2019-07-08 21:21:00,8243,"The Apple don't fall far from the tree. Dat der fish could pull you and your toon around all day and not break a sweat. Do fish sweat? That there is one nice Salmon and kudo's to the offspring. The very 1st absolute first Salmon I caught on a charter years ago, in the early 80's was on a charter out of LaSalle Marina in Burlington. It was my turn so I took the rod. 32 lb. King. I was on the board for a few days for the old Salmon Hunt, I think it was the TO Star. No weekly 10G's then, just your name n the paper. I did get a small prize for being in 1st for a while, I believe I ended up 40th or so. The winner was a 40 some pounder, new truck and boat was 1st prize. My former spouse would have made me trade it in for new furniture or stuff. The guys that had been Salmon guys for years weren't to impressed with my luck and it was sheer luck but I landed her. It felt like reeling in a VW Beetle that was in reverse gear. I remember my Uncle telling me once that when you think when a Salmon is off reel like a bugger, they will run towards you, he was right."

1046873,SirCranksalot,2019-07-10 00:34:00,3291,"Great fish, Brian. Maybe he can give you a few tips!! "
1046876,Moosebunk,2019-07-10 01:23:00,3970,Hey!  The kid's got serious skills... or luck... or both!  That apple fell real far from the tree. lol. JOKING!!! Congrats to the lad.
