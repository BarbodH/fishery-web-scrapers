1045944,Freshtrax,2019-06-18 01:06:00,2215,"Been busy guys, havent posted in a while.  My first child was born in feb so no ice fishing this year and only a few quick trips on lake o this year. But its that time of year again for my boys week up north. We added 2 new faces this year ( one was my dad  which was amazing) and an extra boat.    We had amazing weather minus the 40k winds on arival day that caused us to change our plan drasticly. amazing camping weather after that minus dodging a few thunderheads.  Had to fish hard to get results and we did some looooooong runs this year and put well over 100 miles on the boats burning 340l of fuel. Pounded the brookies and lakers pretty good and got a few nice gators too.   I will let the pics do the talkin from here. j                           "
1045945,Freshtrax,2019-06-18 01:11:00,2215,few more                          
1045950,Tomcat,2019-06-18 01:56:00,395,Great pics!! Thanks for sharing.
1045957,chris.brock,2019-06-18 03:01:00,4053,"Awesome. The picture of just the campfire appeals to me the most. I've never been, but I know how special Nipigon is. I wanna be sitting at that campfire on that nice evening, if that makes any sense."
1045958,Freshtrax,2019-06-18 03:26:00,2215,make complete sence... I spend hundreds of hours 358 days a year thinking about that place. Go chris!
1045962,spincast,2019-06-18 09:45:00,3279,"nice trip Ace - looks like you did very well on the target species!  340 litres! that is some serious running (& $$$), especially on a lake with no charts and structure that'll come out those depths to the surface in seconds.   Nipigon is an anglers heaven for sure."
1045967,crappieperchhunter,2019-06-18 12:09:00,2582,"Lotsa great shots but just like Chris that campfire shot really spoke to me too. Lotsa fish, lotsa friends and lotsa great memories. Thanks for sharing it all with us."
1045969,jimmer,2019-06-18 12:23:00,2730,"Amazing, thanks for sharing your memorable trip with all of us!"
1045978,mamona,2019-06-18 13:21:00,597,Just wow (typing from my cubicle)
1045979,AKRISONER,2019-06-18 13:32:00,5558,"i think this is what many of us work for a living for...those few special days a year that seem to just ""fill us up"" thats a lot of fish caught. Very well done!"
1045980,JoshS,2019-06-18 13:34:00,729,Looks awesome thanks for putting up all the pics. A trip I've always wanted to do and will one day soon. One of my favourite times' of any camping/fishing trip is the wind down by the fire after a long day on the water. Relaxing just thinking about it!
1045982,Jds63,2019-06-18 13:40:00,1365,Wow some great pics there .. thanks for sharing Congratulations on the new baby !!!
1045983,BillM,2019-06-18 13:50:00,17367,"Nice man!  If I wasn't in the middle of getting my house ready for sale I would have seen you up there.  Great spot for a campfire, that nice reef there isn't a bad brookie spot either I'm hoping to get up in August, maybe Sept but who knows.  Next spring for sure. "
1045986,Freshtrax,2019-06-18 14:30:00,2215,head on a swivil at all times.. travel routes are planned out ahead of time via satelite images and plugged into gps.  had our fair share of butt puckers only kissed bottom once. The new 115 fourstoke drank way less than i thught it would.  Adams 2 stoke on the other hand.....  all in all cheap entertainment.  wasnt the plan to camp there we were planning on a spot mid lake more central to the areas we wanted to explore but when you get high wind warnings on that lake you go with the flow.    we had 3-4 fters just getting to that site.  aint that the truth..
1045995,offgriddin,2019-06-18 17:52:00,39,"sounds like a fantastic trip!especially having your old man there....thats where great memories are made my friend  btw,that fist laker is damn gorgeous!beautiful color and markings"

1046001,BillM,2019-06-18 20:25:00,17367,That's definitely not a lake to mess around on.   You made a good choice.
