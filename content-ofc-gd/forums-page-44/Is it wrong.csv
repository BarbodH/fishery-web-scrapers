1046815,DRIFTER_016,2019-07-09 01:04:00,10439,If I remember correctly that was Blue Thunder's slip. I mated on 4 of the boats that docked there back in the day.
1046819,smitty55,2019-07-09 01:42:00,928,Yep I had of those too that I got from Dougie with all the paper rolls. Somehow it disappeared after the fire along with some other things. Never trust those guys.  Cheers
1046851,AKRISONER,2019-07-09 15:30:00,5558,what the heck do you do when it rains running a paper graph? lol
1046856,smitty55,2019-07-09 15:50:00,928,"The window is well sealed, not a problem."
1046858,misfish,2019-07-09 18:30:00,29133,I believe you are right. 2 up from that was the Big Chief . That boat was HUGE. And smoked like crazy when it fired up.
1046861,David Chong,2019-07-09 20:03:00,836,"Some pros are now running 16"" units but many have 4 12"" units, 2 at the driver's console and 2 at the bow of the boat! I know that as our eyes age the bigger screens are helpful! LOL"
1047157,Cando,2019-07-17 04:52:00,90,"I think I'm going to rig up my 40"" 3D tv to a FF and watch those big eyes blow me a kiss the turn and swim away from my bait"
1047158,Chuck Enwinde,2019-07-17 05:16:00,247,Why do I get the feeling he's on the phone to tech support?
1047161,lifeisfun,2019-07-17 09:55:00,99,"""Where is the power button on this TV?"""
1047162,lifeisfun,2019-07-17 10:00:00,99,"On the other hand, without side imaging  I'm pretty sure we would have missed this fish the other day ...   "
1047174,AKRISONER,2019-07-17 14:16:00,5558,"when i win the lottery, I honestly would switch from a hummimbird man right over to garmin, especially seeing that new trolling motor they brought out at icast.  "
1047180,lifeisfun,2019-07-17 16:54:00,99,"Don't see any reason my self to upgrade, SI works perfect for what I do And the new trolling motor better gets tested before I shell out that kind of money. "
1046296,DRIFTER_016,2019-06-26 22:46:00,10439,To have fishfinder envy?   ? 
1046297,misfish,2019-06-26 22:52:00,29133,"LOL  I am sure they are working on 36"" screens.  I would buy that. LOL"
1046300,vance,2019-06-27 02:48:00,719,the neighbours wife has 38's but that doesn't make her better just bigger !!!!  ?
1046312,jimmer,2019-06-27 16:39:00,2730,"Don't you think that some of this is just getting a little too much for catching fish the size of bass?  I'm sure it helps to catch fish and can be fun at times, but....I guess I don't know what I'm saying.  Way too much money sitting in front of him....probably the value of my whole boat. LOL"
1046313,Fisherman,2019-06-27 16:47:00,7201,"Well for some people there is no limit to extreme.  While f/f may show the fish,  they don't put them on the hook.   That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. ?"
1046314,woodenboater,2019-06-27 17:22:00,2277,"I've used electronics but I probably wouldn't go this far. I'm not a tourney fisherman, and I kind of prefer enjoying the scenery. wolsley bay and the west arm are stunning enough that all I worry about are the granite prop killers   to each their own I 'spose"
1046317,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-27 17:59:00,8243,Good one Vance. If you notice the fisherguy looks to be an older gent. That's about the size of screens I need to be able to see them now. Too far away for cheater glasses and too close for distance specs.
1046323,dave524,2019-06-27 19:43:00,4508,"Bass fisherman ?‍♂️Probably never fishes deeper than 20 feet most of the time, fish are displayed at 1/4 scale ?."
1046324,BillM,2019-06-27 21:09:00,17367,"I could muck around with those units all day and still be happy after I put the boat on the trailer, who am I kidding"
1046334,porkpie,2019-06-28 12:35:00,2521,"I love having current electronics, and I’m a big believer in redundancy.  But..... that might be taking it a touch far lol.  I run twin 7’s and can see pretty much all I need to!"
1046335,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-28 12:51:00,8243,If it's in the budget I say go for it cause you can. It got us talking.
1046337,AKRISONER,2019-06-28 13:00:00,5558,"Bit of an electronics junkie myself twin 7’s at the console and a 9 at the front. Wish I could go bigger but I’m also not sponsored lol chris zaldain has close to $20,000 in electronics on his boat. If I was running his boat and the electronics were free I’d be doing the same thing."
1046342,Sinker,2019-06-28 13:13:00,8692,That should be illegal. Distracted driving 100%.  S.
1046343,BillM,2019-06-28 13:36:00,17367,lol now that's funny
1046351,smitty55,2019-06-28 16:59:00,928,"What I'd like to see is a tournament where no electronics are allowed, then we'd really get to see who the best fishermen are. Now that would be interesting.  Cheers"
1046364,ecmilley,2019-06-29 01:13:00,2163,If it was in my budget would have 4 16 Lowrance graphs . Don't knock it till you try it ! Currently run a 10 and a 8 not bad then used a boat recently with 12s HDS live iam sold old eyes.see it better lol. As for the 20ft deep remark maybe here in Ontario over 20 ft bass fishing isn't overly common but try staying on ledges and sunken timber in 60-80 ft of water in southern USA reservoirs all this technology gets developed in conjunction with pro s and then it's a trickle down effect to us weekend warriors
1046424,grimsbylander,2019-06-30 23:47:00,3016,Some interesting comments. What isn’t understood must be unnecessary.
1046440,misfish,2019-07-01 15:13:00,29133,"Looking at my 5"" screen this weekend and trying to see the depth on the graph is a pain at times. Have to zoom in but lose alot of area. I am waiting for the 55 inch wide screen HD to come out. I will manage some how, to mount it to the toon. LOL"
1046444,dave524,2019-07-01 16:24:00,4508,"Somewhere in the basement , there is a 40 year old Lowrance 1510B that runs 4 inch thermal paper if anyone want to go retro. ?"
1046783,smitty55,2019-07-08 01:39:00,928,I have one also but I only have 2 rolls of paper left. I had picked up a good bunch of rolls from Shag but they got lost after a fire and I can't find them anymore.
1046793,DRIFTER_016,2019-07-08 16:03:00,10439,My first good finder was an X-16 paper graph.
1046795,dave524,2019-07-08 16:48:00,4508,"Today you can get a HiTech 7inch with GPS for about what we paid for those back then and even at that they ate a 5 buck roll of paper every couple of trips, but at least you could fill up a 5 gal tank for less than $10. The X16 came out in 85, think I got the 1510B in '80 or '81, had it a year or 2 before I got the boat in '82, got it at Shortwave Marine in Port Credit when they were still on Stavebank."
1046797,DRIFTER_016,2019-07-08 17:27:00,10439,I ended up trading mine in at Shortwave for an LMS-350A. Got a decent deal on it with the trade in. I was the first guy in my circle with GPS.
1046799,dave524,2019-07-08 19:05:00,4508,"I went to another paper graph, a Sitex HE357, had a wide angle 50 khz transducer ,  actually, in the end preferred the narrow 192 khz of the Lowrance, even for downrigging, ended up with both on the centre console. Yeah , Loran C sucked, never owned one but had some experience with it on a buddy's charter."
1046807,misfish,2019-07-08 22:09:00,29133,"I remember the hardware store in the port. That guy carried everything for the salmon guys. Also remember Short wave. I was a shore guy back then,but stopped in there to see the fancy stuff. The first dock at the bridge west side , was my hot spot for the run. Thanks Dave for triggering the memory."
