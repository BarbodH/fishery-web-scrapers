1046159,OhioFisherman,2019-06-23 01:39:00,6623,"Hello all. disappeared due to a sudden hospital stay and I am now in an extended stay rehab - nursing home facility for an unknown period of time. Trying to learn to use a lap top computer, new deal for me and a bit different than my trusty desktop. Hope everyone is well and  fishing!"
1046160,Jmeyer,2019-06-23 01:55:00,83,"Wishing you a speedy recovery, hopefully you can wet a line this summer as well"
1046163,dave524,2019-06-23 02:50:00,4508,"Hope all turns out OK,  we are the same age if I remember correct."
1046164,Big Cliff,2019-06-23 10:39:00,6899,Get well soon!
1046165,lew,2019-06-23 10:45:00,12766,"Best of luck Paul, hopefully this is just a bump in the road."
1046166,ehg,2019-06-23 12:02:00,2666,I have the same disease Paul.  Have not fished for 7 yrs. because of it. Power wheelchair with me in it weighs about 400 lbs. I will never fish again. MS is nasty.. Hopefully you get out of hospital. Everywhere here  is wheelchair accessible thankfully. MS is very progressive 
1046167,pics,2019-06-23 15:08:00,1268,Not fishing much but I will post a trip report soon. I never really thought about how many people are on here that no longer fish but still want to be a part of the community. ..
1046169,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-23 16:00:00,8243,"Get better, that's an order from headquarters. I enjoy our PM bull sections."
1046170,misfish,2019-06-23 16:31:00,29133,Keep your spirits up Paul. You will get the hang of the lap top.
1046171,lew,2019-06-23 16:56:00,12766,"Best wishes to you too Eric, both you & Paul have been more than inspirational over all these years with how well you've handled this disease and I don't ever remember either one of you actually whining about the hand you were dealt. Lots of folks whine about every ache or pain but not you two."
1046172,Old Ironmaker,2019-06-23 17:30:00,8243,"Being from Hamilton everyone would talk about ""tough guys."" This guy paddy stacked 5 guys outside a bar, that guy can bench 500 pounds, that guy did 10 years standing on his head,"" on and on. A tough guy is someone like Paul. Dealt a bad hand in life and doesn't miss a beat. Never complains and inspires others. I know many real deal ""tough guys and gals."" And I know guys that had to go home early from work because they had the sniffles."
1046188,jimmer,2019-06-24 14:03:00,2730,Hope you're up and about soon. Get well! 
1046198,Squid,2019-06-24 17:04:00,1656,Get well soon Paul!!
1046448,OhioFisherman,2019-07-01 16:53:00,6623,"Thanks for the well wishes guys, hoping to bust out of this place Wednesday, it has been a learning experience!"
1046449,bigugli,2019-07-01 17:28:00,6138,"Nobody really expects what age and disease will do to many of us. All I can say is keep fighting. I know its not easy, But what's the alternative???  I'm not into sitting back and waiting for death to win. No matter how many times you fall, fight back. There's still lots of life to enjoy."
1046537,bassman87,2019-07-03 00:31:00,586,get well my man
1046619,Cando,2019-07-04 03:41:00,90,Get well soon my friend.
1046620,misfish,2019-07-04 10:40:00,29133,Hope yer home in your comfort zone Paul.
1047046,OhioFisherman,2019-07-13 20:37:00,6623,"Yep Brian, home since last Thursday night and glad to be here!"
