The office I work out of is a shared executive envirnoment (We rent an office space in a much larger office environment) and one of the other clients in our space is .... The Miss Universe Canada Pagent! Well, our collective receptionist just informed me that they will begin the ""interview"" process at 3:00 today for contestants for the 2007 Miss Universe pagent. This has been going on here for the last 4 years I've been working here and the best is yet to come!!! First, they interview them, create a short list then, they have the bathing suit competition in a couple of weeks... in the board room, two doors down from me!!! I recall a couple of years ago, they had to teach one of the girls (eventually worn the Miss Universe Canada pagent) how to walk in heels! Oh... did I mention she was in a bikini walking the halls for a couple of hours... didn't get much work done that day! Guess I'm gonna have a good start to the weekend! Cheers! HH"
