4146,Dabluz,2006-11-23 02:06:00,701,"  For hard water fishing, I also stay away from wearing gloves or mitts when I'm holding my fishing rod.  When it gets around -10 or colder, I will wear thin wool gloves.  If the bite is very slow, I set my rod on my plastic pail and watch the rod tip while my hands are in the pockets of my parka.  There is no magic formula.  All depends on temperature, wind, type of fishing equipment used, etc, etc.  However, the big thing is to have 3 or 4 different pairs of gloves and mitts to cover any situation and lots of hand towels to keep the hands dry.  I have a bit of N.American Indian in my blood.  That means that I have a few more fine blood vessels close to the surface of my skin.  This has kept my hands warmer than the average fisherman over the years.  But a few years ago, I found that even after fishing on some cold days of summer, during the drive home, my hands would start to itch like mad when they got warmed up in my vehicule.  I found out a bit later that I am diabetic.  This means that I was experiencing the first symptomes of loss of blood circulation.  I'm taking pills now and my blood sugar levels are great.  I have no numbness in my hands or feet but I do realize that I am not as immune from the cold as I used to be.  It now takes only a matter of minutes for my hands to get cold and they tend to stay cold for a longer period before warming up again.  Same goes for my feet.  For any of you guys who have athletes foot, jock itch, slight numbness and easily get cold feet or hands, I recommend a check up to see if they have a bit of a problem with blood sugar levels in their blood.  Since being on medication, all of those symptomes have disappeared."

I'll have to get that checked it can be -20 and a wind, i dont feel the cold until i get into the truck or the cottage then my hands burn and itch. as long as i have my big fur hat on Im as warm as toaste in the oven!!!!  PAss the perch!!!! or spread the laker juice!!!!!  besides if your wearing gloves and you jigg up a laker from 60 feet, by the time you set the hook and try and take off your gloves the fish is gone as well as your bait!!!  You guys need to get your hands use to the Cold!!!! try this..........come home late three nights in a row and put some fine perfume on befor you you get to the door, give the wife a big hug or run for the shower and let her get a wiff of the sweet smell.................Whammmo sub zero in two second, then just put your hands on her back for a few days and you will be good to go!!!!!!"
4544,Bly,2006-11-24 05:37:00,1556,"My husband and I want to thank EVERYONE who posted with great advice in this thread.  We took a little from everyone's post and decided on a few new pairs that we bought have used in the last few nights.  We made sure to take lots of spares with us as well.  Because of this, I was able to stick it out fishing for longer than I normally would have.  If you have a minute,  check out ccmtcanada's post called ""Walleye Report - Nov 23"" to see how you all helped!!!"
4618,wuchikubo,2006-11-24 14:18:00,1114,so which gloves did you end up getting that worked the best? Please do tell.
4652,Terry,2006-11-24 15:35:00,14456,you wear heavy mittens  but use an underwater camera to see the bite.... you don't have to feel anything......lol
4737,Bly,2006-11-24 19:07:00,1556,"  I did purchase the Manzella bow hunting gloves that I mentioned.  I went to the store and tried several kinds while taking into consideration all the great tips from here.  These gloves are thinner and waterproof, maybe not as much as others but they outlasted the neoprene and they did not break my budget.  With all the talk of layers, extra gloves and so on, I wanted a glove that would be warm and waterproof on it's own but allow me to confidently handle my rod and that I could add layers under and/or over so I could adapt them to weather conditions fairly easy.  The manzella's held up great last night   Thanks again! Blyght    My brother is always yelling at me about feeling the bite...""Do you want to be warm or do you want to catch fish?""  Well, being me, I want both  LOL"
4740,wuchikubo,2006-11-24 19:09:00,1114,Thx
4745,Headhunter,2006-11-24 19:18:00,5703,"Another suggestion... take up the guitar! The more circulation you have in your hands, the warmer they'll feel and playing guitar will push more blood to your hands! (And the girls like it too!) HH"
4748,Bly,2006-11-24 19:22:00,1556,"  I know that the ""girls"" like it, I am one and my husband plays the guitar    Maybe I should have him teach me to play."
3682,raysfish2005,2006-11-22 03:04:00,163,"HHHHHHHHHHHhhmmmm i must be doing something wrong?  i dont wear gloves when i'm fishing..............and yes i'm talking hard water, how the heck do you feel a bite when your hands are in a pair of mitts?  I do use them for walking out to the fish or for pulling a sled, but to jigg with ............nope ask BILL.  I still have the same pair off mitts my kids gave me for Xmas 8 years ago crappy can specials, black with fake wool inside."
3692,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 03:09:00,7971," Yes...well...where we fish (shore of Lake O), the cold air is usually accompanied by 30km/h winds!!!!  We need 30 pound gloves to avoid being blown into the water."
3699,tjsa,2006-11-22 03:14:00,1578,"The knit gloves I am talking about, you can feel bites with, they are not a thick knit, but a tight knit. Not those ones that allow you to pull your fingers out of while still wearing them. Those things are thick, too thick, will keep your fingees warm when worn, but not really practical up here."
3707,Blake,2006-11-22 03:25:00,418,Look into the Ice Armour Gloves
3709,Big Swede,2006-11-22 03:28:00,23,"I used to use mitts (with a retractable finger cover) but I always ended up getting hooked and trebs and wool do not get along all that well  Just recently I bought a $20 pair of boating gloves at BPS (they were on special) and was very pleased with them. They're waterproof and worked like a charm when fishing, specifically trolling. But I even left them on when casting my baitcast reel. At worst, I took my reeling hand glove off and left a heat pack in my pocket. The weather was cold (less than 5 degrees) and windy at times but I couldn't complain about having real cold hands."
3713,Rizzo,2006-11-22 03:47:00,4754,"no sir, I don't wear gloves.  I used to stick my hands down my pants but that would make ""general sherman"" cold, now I just stick em down others' pants.  Seems to work"
3725,ccmtcanada,2006-11-22 04:18:00,7971," Remind me never to shake your hand, wear my belt tight, and not to let my wife fish with you....then we're fine!"
3764,smellin fishy,2006-11-22 11:59:00,21,"I just got a pair of Carnhart insulated waterproof gloves.  they are really awsome.  I stuck my hand in the water with the gloves on and they didn't get wet.  They aren't neopreme but made with the same material as a good waterproof jacket.  They are really warm, light and waterproof.  Oh ya,  pretty pricey too dammit."
3937,Bly,2006-11-22 18:43:00,1556,"  These sound very interesting, don't suppose you have a good picture of them or know anyone that might have the pattern etc to make em??  My daughter loves to knit and thinking I might convince her to try and make some."
3946,douG,2006-11-22 19:37:00,2693,"Remember that if you aren't wearing enough on your head and neck, your hands and feet will get cold no matter how good your boots and gloves are.  If you can keep most of the heat in your body that would leave from the top and core, you will be surprised how easy it is to keep your pinkies and tootsies toasty.  You just can't beat toasty tootsies.  My float suit has built in side pockets on the chest that are sorta like those hand muffs that you strap on your waist.  I could probably put one of those handwarmer packets in there too."
4004,aplumma,2006-11-22 21:49:00,6896,No one has mentioned Hand muffs that you strap on your waist and they have openings for you to stuff your hands in. I use it when I go hunting with a handwarmer packet in it and thin shooting gloves.  Art
4022,misfish,2006-11-22 22:19:00,29133," You didnt see Rizzos post then.LMAO.  Yep I got one of them for in the stand.Throw in a hand warmer pad and your all toasty.  Sorry blyght, dont have a picture of the mitts I was talking about.Im sure if you search the web.Maybe eastcoast wool mitts or something like that you may find them. I,ll see if I can find a site or picture for you.  My brother may still have his pair.I,ll check with him also."
