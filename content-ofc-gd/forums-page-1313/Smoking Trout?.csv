2898,Dabluz,2006-11-20 21:24:00,701,There are a bunch of sites on the internet.  I usually let my filets soak for only a couple of hours at the most.  I only use salt...maybe some onions too.  I let dry the filets a good while before putting in the smoker.  I let the filets smoke about 1 hour.  It's one of those Canadian Tire smokers and there is quite a bit of heat so the trout get cooked too.  I don't like a real heavy smoke flavour.
2911,Daplumma,2006-11-20 22:04:00,1961,"Thanx,That sounds about right.I did some online searching also and looking for something simple.Sounds like you have the same type of  smoker as I do.Does more cooking than smoking. Joe"
2914,ChrisK,2006-11-20 22:06:00,2772,"Joe, This one is one of my favoourites... Smoked Salmon Deluxe(or Rainbow Trout) 1/3 cup of sugar 1/4 cup non iodized salt 1 cup water 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp pepper 1/2 tsp of tabasco sause 1 cup dry white wine  Brine Salmon or Trout chunks 8 or more hours,keep refrigerated Put through smoking process......enjoy !!!  Good Luck !!"
2921,Woodsman,2006-11-20 22:19:00,1286,After removing the fish from the brine I recomend you let them tack up before putting in smoker. This lets the sugars in the brine form a glaze on the outside of the fish & also starts the drying process. It is a simple process  where you put the fish on racks to let air circulate arround the fish & place in fridge for 8-12 hrs. Also using brown sugar in the brine works excellent.  Good Luck: Rick

3129,Nemo,2006-11-21 03:25:00,727,I heard they are bad for your health and habit forming. Please don't inhale....har har har
3174,Dabluz,2006-11-21 05:15:00,701,"There was a while there where I was eating lots of smoked trout and salmon.  I was even smoking the trout and salmon sold in grocery stores....you know the inexpensive stuff at about 1.50 a lb.  I was letting them soak for a long time in fancy brine mixtures and smoking them a long time in the smoker.  Too much of that heavily smoked fish is hard on the stomach.  Since I went to a more delicate smoke flavour, I really got to like it that way.  Everybody who tastes my smoked trout and salmon really like it that way too."

4303,Fisherman,2006-11-23 17:21:00,7201,"I think the only other one that got it right is dabluz, brining is using nothing more than salt to dehydrate and firm the meat, I've been led to believe that adding all the other stuff leads to marinating and imparts a whole different taste to the fish."
4306,Daplumma,2006-11-23 17:29:00,1961,"I brined them in salt,water,honey and brown sugarfor about 6 hrs.Rinsed them off a bit and I let them dry and firm up for about 12 hrs in a 40 degree garage with a cileing fan circulating the air.Smoked them in apple chips for 3 hrs,1st two hours on very low 90 100 degrees.The last hour was at 200 degrees or so.They came out perfect!Thanx for the help! Joe"
