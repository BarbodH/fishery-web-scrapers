I have never fished for Lake Trout, perhaps I should try Lake Temagami.  Having a lake such as Lake Nipissing available is to my liking, never been skunked there. Where are you going and why???????????? Have a great day. Sarmoti,)))))))))))"

4172,Rizzo,2006-11-23 02:52:00,4754,will head for a few different small lakes just south of parry sound that always issue lots of action for hammerhandles
4183,irishfield,2006-11-23 03:14:00,26272, Keep in mind you can only fish Lakers on Temagami from Feb 15 to Mar 15. This will also LIKELY be the time frame for every other lake North from Nippissings South shore when the new 2007 regs come out...unless the lake has been stocked in the last couple years.
