4390,just2manylures,2006-11-23 21:14:00,144,"Mulit Species is tough to find.  I like to buy 1 or 2 species specific mags a year and they are usually packed with so much info that I can't try it all out in the short summer we have...not to mention the fact that my wife makes my summer even shorter. By the lack of response to this post would it be safe to say that mags are out and internet in?  Do you hear the ""Technology Train"" rolling by?  my 2 cents  2many"

I used to subscribe to Fly Tyer and Canadian Fly Fisher, great mags, but I dont have time for fly tying or fishing any more. I just chuck hardware for now."
