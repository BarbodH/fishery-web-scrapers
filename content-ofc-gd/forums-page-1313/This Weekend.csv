4500,charlied,2006-11-24 02:25:00,584,"I plan on fishing alot this weekend...fri, sat, sun...total of about 25 hours of fishing...can't wait......LOL"
4578,SlowPoke,2006-11-24 12:45:00,2984,"Hey Mike, give me a shout if you're looking for company. I still owe you for the coffee and timbits from the last time out! -Brian"
4582,Mike the Pike,2006-11-24 13:05:00,3421,You in the same boat as me Wayne.You have to do your chores and please the wife.
4596,irishfield,2006-11-24 13:39:00,26272, Yes Mike...I have to do chores but only because I like to be warm in my shop...not to please the wife! LOL  She'll be splitting wood right beside me as always...good exercise and a tractor/hydraulic splitter isn't something you should be doing without a partner...just like fishing.
