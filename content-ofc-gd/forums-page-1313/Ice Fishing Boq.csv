4241,DT10Sam,2006-11-23 13:51:00,480,"Hi Everyone,  I have been getting some emails asking about the ice fishing on the BOQ.  I will be pleased to inform all those interested when the ice is on the Bay and what areas the fish are in etc. when it happens.  Right now one of my employees and I seem to have to fight to see who gets what days off to go fishing...LOL....he forgets I sign his pay cheques  I sound tough but he is really a great guy and very knowledgeable of the Bay, his name is Glen Hales and he is also the photographer for Canadian Fly Fisher magazine  Canadian Fly Fisher  Glen will be doing some guiding during the hard water season.  I also have a deal with Rob Coolahan from Hooked on Outdoors where he has packages with accomodations at the Ramada Inn.  Hooked on Outdoors  When things begin we will post with pics as proof and maybe we can get a g2g happening this winter on hard water as well.  Feel free to send me a PM and I will be pleased to answer and help you out.  Best regards, Sam"

4265,ehg,2006-11-23 14:49:00,2666,"Ice fishing at BOQ was my fave through the 90's. The fishing took a bit of a dive around 2001, I've gone once a year since then. Still caught fish however. Emerald shiners on jigging raps or Swedish Pimples were the key. Here is a coupla fish from around 2000 at Long Reach.(scanned)   cheers,  ehg"
