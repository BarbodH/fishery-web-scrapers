I was thinkin of a cottage type place with possibley a hut out on the lake, but dont have a snowmobile to get to and from. Is there such a place to rent a sled/cottage/hut all wrapped in one or am I dreamin? What do most of you people do just drive your truck out? From my understanding fish go deeper in the hard water season, how far from shore do you usually have to go I'm not really up to the idea of lugging fishing gear across a lake by foot know what I mean? Any advice would be great as I'm new to ice fishing and am excited to get out.  Any recomendations? Thanks Greg Sheppard.   "
