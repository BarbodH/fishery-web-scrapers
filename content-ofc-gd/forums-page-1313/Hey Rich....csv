4197,BabyHerc,2006-11-23 04:15:00,285,"Great Rockies, guys"
4204,crappieperchhunter,2006-11-23 05:25:00,2582,"Sorry it took me so long to get the pics to you Beans. It sure is a beauty. The biggest one I saw this fall for sure. Next fall when we get in there it will be even BIGGER. Gotta love those ""Red Eyes""."
4287,Seahag,2006-11-23 16:30:00,19,Rockies are killing the lake where i fish in the fall.  The pickerel river system near golden vally.  comanda area.  We used to catch walleye in the hundreds.  released most of them and only took enough for a shore lunch once a year.  This area of water is not heavily fished and only one camp is on the system and it mostly goes to hunters.  In recent years we catch rockies 30 or 40 to every 1 pickerel.  The lodge owner says kill them all.  These rockies are huge and bigger then anything i see on this board.  In lakes like this where they are taking over is it ok to kill them.  Will killing the ones ya catch really make a difference.  I resent them becuase  we catch pickerel where we catch the rock bass except i spend tons on minnows to weed out the rockies.  it's getting expensive.  minnows are not cheap anymore.    Rock bass are great to catch for fun and guranteed action for kids.  but it's killing the walleye and bass populations in this lake.
4308,wuchikubo,2006-11-23 17:30:00,1114,"Seahag,  sounds like we need to set up a rockbass tourney up there!  Honestly, this is the first time I've heard of rock bass being the invasive species.  Maybe have the MNR have muskie introduced into the lake to munch on them."
4321,Woodsman,2006-11-23 17:58:00,1286,Heres my PB.    Heck anyone can catch the big ones. It takes skills to catch the little ones.
4388,just2manylures,2006-11-23 21:09:00,144,Rockies are one of my personal fav's in the pan.  A twist of lemon and a pinch of salt.  Keep it simple and your taste buds will thank you  my 2 cents  2many
