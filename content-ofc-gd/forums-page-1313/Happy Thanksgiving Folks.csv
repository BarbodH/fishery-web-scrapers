I retired from 32 years being a CPA in June, and now work part time in fly fishing department at Cabelas in Dundee......paid to talk fishing all day!! A special gift for us this year as my son drew random R&R and is with us from Iraq, where he is a combat platoon leader with 10th Mountain Division. Life is indeed good, and much to be thankful for. Best to all out there.  Let me know if pics don't come thru."
