3901,mpt,2006-11-22 17:22:00,158,Thanks everyone of you. I just wish I had a dish to get the 3rd game.
3904,1leggedangler,2006-11-22 17:32:00,364,"All the best to our Southern neighbours for the Thanksgiving Holiday!!! Now back away from the table slooowly. Any of you guys doing the deep fried bird thing?  Cheers, 1leg"
3907,Whopper,2006-11-22 17:42:00,2174, No 1leg it's gonna be traditional at our house. I can cook a lot of different things but I've tried the turkey frying twice and both times it wasn't pretty.  Whopper
3909,bigfish1965,2006-11-22 17:44:00,3382,"Happy Turkey Day! Deep fried turkey has to be yummy, but it should likely come with a defibrillator."
3916,John,2006-11-22 17:54:00,2956,"Actually Rick its pretty much ""greasless"" if there is such a word. We did one for Canadian Thanksgiving and it turned out wonderful. Eighteen pounder from raw on the counter to cooked on the plate in 50 minutes. Just need to be safety concious and stay away from the wobblies until after it is cooked. Fifteen litres of oil (recycled to use again). Anyone wants a set of printed directions and safety tips, let me know.  The results are magnificent. Perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.  John..."
3917,setomonkey,2006-11-22 17:55:00,872,"Happy T-day!  I'm still hoping to try turducken one of these days: that's a deboned turkey that's been stuffed with a deboned duck, that's been stuffed in turn with a deboned chicken.  Mmmmmmmm....  Turducken on Wikipedia    Mike"
3928,bpsbassman,2006-11-22 18:11:00,941,"Will be crossing the border tomorrow to help our American friends celebrate. The wife is all pumped for Black Friday. Are we nuts The plan though is to go somewhere for a relaxing breakfast while the idiots beat up on each other for the Door Crashers and hopefully pick up a few bargoons later in the day. We haven't been away together since spring, so I can't complain given all the fishing I did all year. All the best to our American OFNers!!"
3935,setomonkey,2006-11-22 18:36:00,872,"I can't get my mind off turducken, esp. if you add bacon...    Mike"
3948,John,2006-11-22 19:42:00,2956,Now that makes the arteries harden just looking at it!
3972,Daplumma,2006-11-22 20:56:00,1961,"Thanks Guys,lookin forward to some real good eating.art and I usually fry a turkey and tradtionally cook one turkey.Gonna skip the frying this year cause we dont have as many people as usual people coming over and its supposed to rain.Rain and hot oil do not mix and I wont fry one anywhere other than the gravel driveway.

Already have an appointment set up with the men in white coats to come over 1/2 hour before they all arive.  Total chaos coming our way."
