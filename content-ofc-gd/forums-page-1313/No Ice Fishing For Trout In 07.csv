4409,irishfield,2006-11-23 22:13:00,26272,Yep...It's what I keep repeating here...but pretty sure there will a month from Feb 15 to Mar 15 that you'll be able to fish for Lakers (like Lake Temagami has been for about a decade). If the lake has been stocked in the last couple years you will be able to fish it all winter...but if not Feb 15 to Mar 15 only.  Hopefully for those that want to fish this winter...the regs will be 4 months late coming out (and possibly part of why they are late coming out...simply to buy another year before the protests really start)
4446,BabyHerc,2006-11-24 00:26:00,285,"Don't fret, Outahere, it's for the better.  You should be catching more and bigger trout in the future as a result of proper regulations, provided they are adhered to."
4452,fishindevil,2006-11-24 00:32:00,6254,"what about the lakes around the bancroft district lots of them are natural production lakes and the season opens jan 1 so will they now be subject to those new regs,or will it remain the way it already is?????/does anybody know that"
4495,knotaclue,2006-11-24 02:10:00,136,"i read"" it's to stay the way it is for now and i think there late on printing or something, it'l all come out in the wash soon i'm sure"
4504,outahere,2006-11-24 02:50:00,6,"Fishindevil....it will apply to all of S. Ontario.   If you like ice fishing for trout, you had better start making noise now.   If it passes like this....it will be too late.   The MNR says their mandate is to manage the fishery.  Why should only summer fishermen have access to the trout.  There is no ""one month fishing"" in the pending regulations.  The MNR claims ice fishermen are responsible for releasing undesireable species into the lakes (minnows).  Thats why they want the winter season closed."
4519,irishfield,2006-11-24 03:19:00,26272,I think your outfitter is slightly misinformed Earl. The meetings I sat thru in Temagami this spring/summer stated what I have typed. If you didn't speak out over the last year or so of public input....you're a day late and Laker short of doing anything about it.  Like Darryl Choronzey says...how do you get 4 MNR biologists in a boat? Offer a free trip and the case of beer. Doesn't matter what season or species you are after...anglers use minnows caught in other water bodies to fish with
4521,BabyHerc,2006-11-24 03:22:00,285,"HA!  ""Why should only summer fishermen have access to trout"".  It's much harder to locate and coax mid-summer trout than in winter, and spawning seasons in still-waters are still fairly protected.  And if the MNR makes the claim about dumping unwanted species, shouldn't we respect that?"
4634,tonyb,2006-11-24 14:56:00,1637,"If they think people will stop fishing those lakes in the winter for trout they are only fooling themselves.  Yet another reason why more enforcement is needed at times like this, when there are regulation changes.  Tony"
4646,BabyHerc,2006-11-24 15:24:00,285,"Good point Tony, regulations mean nothing without enforcement."
