4688,wuchikubo,2006-11-24 16:49:00,1114,"Yeah, I figured that out by looking up their website.  I guess I'll have to purchase an OFC hat if I get called.  Of course I mentioned seeing it here!"
4793,just2manylures,2006-11-24 20:55:00,144,Wait you don't have an OFC hat.  If it weren't for OFC clothing I would be naked 6 out of 7 days a week.  my 2 cents  2many
4795,Kirk,2006-11-24 20:59:00,347,"hmmm, so you have to have a house...it has to be presentable on TV, that eliminates Port Perry LOL"
4805,Joey,2006-11-24 21:23:00,9122,"Okay, I signed up    Maybe they'll prefer a chick    As for the OFC hat, that bad luck omen that has been haunting my boat for years TJ, I don't know about that  Wish me luck.  Joey"
4820,Dave Mercer,2006-11-24 22:18:00,148,"Hey everyone! I just got off the phone with the folks at WFN. They are getting great response!  Just goes to show the power of the OFC nation. Whoever the people are that are chosen by WFN to do this, I guarantee you one thing - we will be having lots of fun! So if you haven't signed up yet, and you want to have lots of laughs and share a few fishing stories, make sure you do.  A few days ago, there was a topic running on all the different guys that host TV shows that are on this site. I can't believe you guys were shocked that some of us were on here all the time. This site is one of the most informative and entertaining fishing sites around. Some of the best anglers in Ontario are on this site and I check in as regularily as I can. Just because some of us host TV shows and work in the biz doesn't mean that we are any less fishing freaks than anyone else (just ask my wife)!  Anyways, keep up the great site and I hope to see some of you for my WFN special and take care!   Regards, Dave Mercer www.factsoffishing.com"
4827,bigfish1965,2006-11-24 22:29:00,3382,Don't live in Toronto or Port Perry...can't afford to move for just a week...dang.
4828,mepps,2006-11-24 22:35:00,1301,So close yet so far...
4838,Dave Mercer,2006-11-24 23:13:00,148,"Hi Folks, Even if you live outside of there indicated area I would still enter. I will be pushing for them to pick a few real hard core fishing freaks and if that means a bit of a drive then I say let's do it. Just let them know how hard core you are!!!!!!  Regards,  Dave Mercer www.factsoffishing.com  P.S Don't forget to tell them that The Facts of Fishing is the greatest LOL!"
4840,Joey,2006-11-24 23:22:00,9122,Thanks Dave.  I hope Richmond Hill is close enough to Toronto.  See you soon  Joey
4861,motv8tr,2006-11-25 00:50:00,2587,"Sounds like a great opportunity, but alas I do not get WFN as I can't afford to upgrade my dish at the moment    and wouldn't you know both those days are my days off  , I have an OFC hat, t-shirt and jacket even    (we need a crying emoticon here)...  Good luck to those who enter...  Maureen"
