4072,Pinch,2006-11-23 00:25:00,231,"Hi all,  I am going to find myself in Toronto next week with a bit of spare time throughout the week and am looking to do a bit of fishing.  Can anybody give me any idea's as to where is a descent river to fish for steelhead? Notice I said river and not 'your secret fishing hole.""  A general area/body of water would be nice.  Thanks"
4075,setomonkey,2006-11-23 00:34:00,872,"Depending on how far you are willing to travel while in Toronto, the closest river would probably be the Humber, towards the west end. Haven't heard anything about it on the new board, there were some salmon reports on the old board I think.  There've been some reports on the Credit River, in Mississauga.  Lots of other tribs too -- Bowmanville, Oshawa, etc. but check the regs on where you can still fish.  Haven't been out myself so I can't give you any more advice than that.  Mike"
