Don't be worrying so much about others, know who your reel buddies are and enjoy life. Congrats on the 12 lber, did you  end up having it for supper, hanging it on the wall or releasing it back into the bay after alll those great trophy pictures? Glad it was a good trip and thanks for sharing."
4056,irishfield,2006-11-22 23:43:00,26272,All fish were released in much less than a minute from time of netting to swimming again. We had cameras already on...OFC sticker in pocket and ready to shoot.
4078,fishhunter,2006-11-23 00:37:00,604,"great pics!!! and once again guys had a blast and want you both outthis summer for salmon and trout. Nice to enjoy a day with two great guys that know how to enjoy a day on the water rain or shine. I'm sorry about the weed fish will work on that next time lol. just a note to all, think of the fish first pics second if you not ready let him go and take pics next round we saw fish out of water for 5 min then put back in the water thats way to long . see if you can hold your breath that long."

4209,Deg,2006-11-23 06:04:00,51,Nice pics Wayne. Are you having a 'Good-bye' party for the old Glastron?  Sounds like a reason to have a Midland swill.

3762,Whopper,2006-11-22 11:54:00,2174,"Great report Wayne and congrats on a PB. Glad to see you have a great time considering the conditions. Don't want to offend anyone else here but if the was one person that deserved a good outing with a personal best it was you Wayne. Thanks for taking the time to put your report together it was a good one. It amazes me the fish that come out of there, and to think that a 27"" is just a little fella  Thanks  Whopper"

I read in the help thread that the limit for pics had to be increased for you for posting!!!!  I just live less than 2 hours west down the 401, so if there is a BOQ trip next year, I have no excuses!!!  Is the BOQ trip usually a fall trip?  Are there Spring trips planned too?  Sounded like everyone had a great time."
