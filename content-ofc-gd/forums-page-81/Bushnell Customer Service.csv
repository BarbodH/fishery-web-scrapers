1013941,mikdor,2017-09-22 00:02:00,109,"I had a pair of Bushnell 10x25 non waterproof binoculars for a minimum of 10 years. In early August I got caught in a real downpour and forgot them in my rainsuit,The next morning they were fogged up really bad. So I phoned Bushnell Canada to see if anything could be done, They said as gesture of good company service I should send them in and they would replace them at no cost. If I wanted to update to a waterproof model to let them know and they would bill Me accordingly, well I didn't let them know and today I recieved a brand new set of Bushnell 10X25s H2O waterproof Binos free of charge. Now that is customer service like I have never seen. From now on if I need optics Bushnell will be My choice. THANK YOU"
1013965,floater,2017-09-22 10:35:00,220,Yes they have a great Customer Service Department. I had a scope for over 12 years that stopped working properly. I took it in to a place near the Airport and they gave me a brand new upgraded scope for free. I didn't even have the receipt with me!
1014111,Jon,2017-09-24 09:22:00,209,I had the strap connector break on a pair of Bushnell binos a few years after I bought them. Took them to Bushnell near Jane and the 407 and they said it couldnt be repaired. End result was a free replacement to the current model. Would I buy Bushnell again simply because of the customer service? Absolutely!
1014118,BillM,2017-09-24 13:57:00,17367,And folks this is why people keep using the same company over and over.  Love threads like these!

If one can afford the high end stuff, who is one to argue ? Hope you get the same service, if needed dave.  I bought a USED, bushnell 3-9X 40 MM scope 15 years ago.  Did I say used ?? Put on my my  Rem 30-06 Semi at that time. Knocked it a  few times,sat in down pours during moose and deer hunts. Never did I need to adjust the sightings.  All the rest of the gang had the high end scopes. I still managed to take 4 deer with that scope, without adjusting. It was still spot on new, when I handed it over to my younger brother . 2 years ago."
1014145,Rodbender,2017-09-24 20:11:00,1027,Love my Bushnell Bino's I just bought a new set set gave my sister my 8X42 natureviews and bought the Legend E 8X42 went in looking for the Nikon's but bought the Bushnell
1014167,glen,2017-09-24 23:37:00,2641,I've got a bushnell bino that doesn't have any focus on it. Just set it to width of you eyes and it's clear.   Great for people of different eye sight.
1014258,akaShag,2017-09-26 00:25:00,2073,"I have had a number of dealings with Bushnell service over the years, and always positive.  Most recently (last month) I asked if they could find a set of scope adjustment knob caps for an OLD Bausch & Lomb scope.  Yes, indeed, and FREE!  I have also had exceptional service from Burris, including stuff that was my fault, all repaired or replaced for FREE.  The ONLY time I asked Leupold for a warranty repair it was turned down (and I know the guy at Korth!)  Doug"
