HEY, that remark resembles me............."
1009437,Dutch01,2017-07-19 18:21:00,1431,"I regularly witness people catching Walleye at night in the Kawarthas, yelling over loud about how it's legal, then run to their car or truck and drive off. Five minutes later they're back fishing again. It's not ""foreigners from Toronto"" doing this (not saying that doesn't happen too)."
1009438,manitoubass2,2017-07-19 18:24:00,11391,I see it here too. Camp is 1000 yards from a great fishing hole. They just make runs back and forth over and over again
1009543,fishermccann,2017-07-20 16:55:00,655,"Most of the poaching I have seen in my lifetimes, is-was, not done by the white bucket crowd, but 'locals' who think because they have lived  there  for generations the law does not apply to them. No season , no limit, no slot."
1009560,RangerGuy,2017-07-20 18:50:00,564,Doesn't really matter who it is... the issue is our government... we live in a country where the bleeding hearts rule and criminals have far more right than they deserve... You can even fight against our country and get a nice retirement package if you fight hard enough.  Things will never change in our country... we are WAY to soft on people that break the law!
1009563,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-20 19:21:00,8243,"Being legal and being a good steward of our resources are not one in the same.  I do agree all ethnicities of our society that may be poaching. I just pointed out the majority seem to share the same cultures, that's just a fact. However he majority of those charged and convicted of hunting and fishing violations in eastern Ont. seem to be of French decent. But the majority of the population is of French decent. So it might be demographics and just that. Close to GTA one group, close to another area, another group. I'll admit when I am off base, never wrong though (tongue in cheek)."
1009564,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-20 19:23:00,8243,This is going to get political real fast. I shall remain silent but want to comment. I am a good soldier and follow orders like a good Canuck.
1009565,Dutch01,2017-07-20 19:25:00,1431,This is a gross misrepresentation of what occurred. The Supreme Court issued two decisions condemning the Government of Canada for breaching the Charter Rights of a Canadian citizen. Said citizen then filed a lawsuit using the SOC decisions to buttress his argument. GOC lawyers decided they would likely lose the case so they settled out of court to reduce their exposure.

Agreed they settled so could say they didn't loose or have to pay more. I'm still perplexed how a person who was proven to have joined an opposing force which puts the very people fighting to protect that citizen gets to keep their citizenship to begin with. Anyways to stay on point the fact is, we have a very soft legal system..  You can kill a family driving drunk and  not even spend 10 yrs in the slammer, when you should see the needle!  Apologies if I hijacked the thread!!!!..this nonsense has just been really irking me lately!!! Probably because I'm in a battle with our town over them trying to take our land for free, so I'm generally just not pleased with our government all round!!!"
1014054,scuro2,2017-09-23 03:30:00,904,"I respectfully disagree that those most or secondmost charged with fishing (or hunting) violations are from a couple of cultures. There are quite a few Canadian sounding names in the reports in the link below.  http://mnrwatch.com/category/offenses/  Jon  Last names only on those charged from the website above: Slough, McCormick, Mr. and Mrs Terry, Galliott, Gauthier, four US fishermen from the north central US, Oâ€™Kelly, Welsh, The Funks, Marr, Zhang, Mihailovic, Martin, Lui, Yu, Wen He, Wu, and Luu.  While I have seen ""white bucket"" fishing there is nothing that makes this illegal. Generally they fish in groups which would allow for larger catch limits. It is their right to keep as many fish as their license allows. The only poaching I have ever directly witnessed was by a older Polish immigrant and twice I have seen American tourists at fishing camps filling coolers with excess fillets destined for the freezer.  Isn't it racist to unfairly single out certain ethnic groups only when it comes to poaching? "
1014055,DanD,2017-09-23 06:05:00,2223,There's just not enough media for the general puplic to care or even know about what the MNR are trying to enforce. If it were law that every offender's name and offence were to be puplished on mainline media it would make more people realize how important it is to keep this resource safe. It would make people think twice if they knew their name and offence would be broadcast on the national news for all to see and hear. Humiliation hurts a lot more then a few bucks out of your pocket.  Dan.

I think they have it right now....I wouldn't mind increased fines and if the fishing community thinks that poaching is a real problem to have more MNR officers hired."
1014276,BillM,2017-09-26 04:27:00,17367,"Targeting fish out of season isn't the same as forgetting your license at home.  One is on purpose, the other is an accident."

Couldn't both be accidental or on purpose? 1) You are not sure where your license is but think it must be in your home...so you fish anyways thinking you could produce it if you had too. 2) You fish bass out of season catch one, move much deeper into weeds and catch another."

In a very few serious cases they can seize vehicles, boats etc.  Even if this does happen, the items are usually returned when the perp goes to court unless the court orders that they be forfeited to the crown which very rarely happens except in very serious cases.  The key is the difference between seize (temporary) and forfeit (bye-bye for good).   Anyway, maybe it would be a bit better penalty in many cases."
1008963,dave524,2017-07-14 22:00:00,4508,"How about both?  Seriously though, I thought it was common to confiscate vehicles?  Pretty sure before they can confiscate a vehicle the offenders have to transport their illegal catch in the vehicle to make it fair game, sitting on the shore with a white bucket of OOS fish and the vehicle parked in the lot , they can't."

I release blue gills too. Did this morning for a matter a fact. Well it,s cousin the sun fish any ways. Hit a top water of all things.              Now, If he caught a nice 4 pound steel head, what would you tell him?"
1009057,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-15 21:51:00,8243,"I started a thread for the exact same event. These fines are more than many I read about on MNR Round Up site. Bigger fines are hunting related. And a majority of those guys charged are guides and outfitters swapping tags. Never have read about forfeit of vehicles and weapons.  It's better than a slap on the wrist. To think fines are a deterrent is being naÃ¯ve. If there is money to be made they will continue doing it. Cost of doing business. I watch Northwoods Law, a reality show about the guys and gals of Fish and Game Wardens in Maine. They are just as lenient as our MNR is, even more if that's possible. More warnings than fines."

1009363,grimsbylander,2017-07-18 16:04:00,3016,"I think there's a lot of room to expand fines before introducing jail sentences. However, having a dividing line between minor and major offenses with jail time for the latter makes sense. Examples: minor - took the skin off a limit of fish. major - illegal/unattended gill nets. One of these is a fine, the other should see jail time. Yes? No?"
1009364,manitoubass2,2017-07-18 16:14:00,11391,I'd agree
1009367,jimmer,2017-07-18 16:26:00,2730,"That makes sense to me.  I wasn't suggesting that minor offenses face jail time, but illegal netting, importing Asian carp, selling game fish, continued illegal action (limits or out of season fishing) could be threatened with jail time."
1009368,Old Ironmaker,2017-07-18 17:17:00,8243,"I know I am going to catch Hell for saying this from some Libs. but it is right there in black and white. Those that are regularly charged for fishing offences are of the same cultures. And the second most individuals charged are from another culture. It is a cultural thing and that is difficult to change peoples mind sets. It is difficult to change cultural paradigms. Hopefully 1st or second generation Canadians with Canadian educations will not carry on these traditional mind sets and hopefully things will change in the near future. I think it will.  I know this first hand. I fished years ago with a guy from the plant and he started putting 8"" Bass in a bucket. I said what the F are you doing? No way no how you could educate him. Good guy but he went through the depression and WW2, no way no how he was going to change in this lifetime. His boat, his charges, he was never caught and he was a life long poacher, and he wasn't the only one I knew back then. I didn't fish with them again but continued to be their friend, these were really good guys except the fishing thing."

1008841,jimmer,2017-07-13 17:54:00,2730,Jail time might be the only way to stop poaching out of season or in sanctuaries.  People sure aren't getting it with just the fines that are handed out.  There is a lot of efforts being made to bring back the walleye in the Kawarthas and this just makes me sick when a few can negate all the positive efforts.

1008850,jimmer,2017-07-13 19:24:00,2730,"Not, sure. But this is a yearly issue around here, so I'm sure fish are being kept."
1008851,GBW,2017-07-13 19:39:00,8460,Did they keep any fish or were they just fishing in a sanctuary? more than likely kept fish so this way the MNR has photo proof to back up the charges one would guess
1008855,PUMP KNOWS,2017-07-13 19:55:00,937,"If that's the case, shouldn't the fines be more?"
