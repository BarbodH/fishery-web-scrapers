1014067,Carp,2017-09-23 15:38:00,1488,"Reaching out to my fellow OFC'ers for help.  I do volunteer work with an air cadet squadron in Mississauga, ON. We are in need of a large shipping container for storage. Preferably a 40 ft. model, but all will be considered.  We are a non profit charitable organization and can issue a tax receipt for a donation or possibly purchase a used container if the price and transportation cost are within our limited budget.  I've also thought about using an old transport trailer. 40 to 53 footer. However, this depends on whether our supporting legion will allow us to put it on their property. A shipping container's lower profile is less of an eyesore to the legion and it's neighbours and much more likely to get approval.  Something similar to the one is this link would be ideal: https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/shipping-container-isolated-white-realistic-vector-illustration-46849227.jpg  Anybody have a connection or idea how we can make this work ?"

Since it is for an air cadet squadron you might get a break or donation of one? I am not sure how they would deliver one outside of a facility meant to deal with them, every time I picked one up they used a crane or huge outdoor forklift to place it on the transport frame.  You could try calling some of the listed sellers and trying for a deal?"
1014074,Fisherman,2017-09-23 18:06:00,7201,You might want to try Borden and see where they get theirs from.  We have them scattered around for storage.

Waiting for a couple of places to get back to me with a quote, but I doubt the numbers will be favourable for us.  You might want to try Borden and see where they get theirs from.

1014180,Carp,2017-09-25 06:53:00,1488,Thanks Meely. Another possibility.
1014255,aplumma,2017-09-25 23:39:00,6896,This should be moved to announcements but since it is for a charitable cause I will let it stay here until someone complains.  Good luck with your search  Art
