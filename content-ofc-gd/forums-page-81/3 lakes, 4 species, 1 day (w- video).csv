1013689,Joeytier,2017-09-18 19:11:00,3990,"For anyone who liked my backlake fishing reports in the past here, I have a YouTube channel for documenting our adventures now. Our first serious video was uploaded today (our first upload was just a quick trial run). We fish 3 lakes in one day, catching brook trout, lake trout, smallies, and pike and enjoy a killer shore lunch breakfast. We're not professionals but we're both happy with the outcome, hopefully some of you will enjoy!"
1013690,Joeytier,2017-09-18 19:15:00,3990,"The video shows up in the preview, but not in the actual post, just my browser??  If it's not working, could anyone embed it in a comment instead?   "
1013692,misfish,2017-09-18 19:39:00,29133,  Welcome to the you tubies club   Great video

1013694,Joeytier,2017-09-18 19:53:00,3990,"Thanks a lot Brian, apparently I'm imcompotent at embedding lol!  Thx Terry, I definitely do.  These are all under 40 km from my driveway."
1013695,the spirit of fishing,2017-09-18 20:13:00,141,"The link worked.Nicely done video of a great 3 lakes in one day outing.Liked how you gave some knowledge about tackle,depths and techniques.I suspected I would really like it and I did.Thanks for sharing."
1013763,aplumma,2017-09-19 19:40:00,6896,very nice video but due to the title I have a you tube channel it has been moved to announcements. The site does not want to become a you tube begging site for views. Please change the title to something like my fishing trip and I will be happy to move it back to the general section as you have requested.  Thanks  Art
1013789,spincast,2017-09-19 22:45:00,3279,beauty water. Nice vid.. Hope to have access to that kind of fish when the retirement gets here.
1013791,OhioFisherman,2017-09-19 22:52:00,6623,"Nice job on the video for a first time, thanks Art for the explanation, wondered why that moved."

1013869,Sinker,2017-09-21 03:26:00,8692,"Cool man....subscribed. I like your style. Real fishing, nothing fancy, no Bull....good stuff.  S."
1013897,JoshS,2017-09-21 18:33:00,729,"I like it. Agree with Sinker... refreshing seeing plain old fishing and no buff's, logo's, and all the other stuff the cool kids are doing.  I never do that kind of fishing. Gotta love our country! I'll be tuning in..."
1013917,Joeytier,2017-09-21 20:54:00,3990,"Thanks!  That was our aim, do it how we do it all the time, and if you're truly passionate, likeminded people will see it.  No sponsors or buffs neccesary haha!"
