Can't speak to the longevity but it is definitely the smoothest reel I've ever used. I bought a cool stand so I won't have to lay it on the pier like my usual shore fishing rods.  The Daiwa Revros on clearance for $49.99 at CT is a good deal too. It's no Stradic, but you won't find a smoother reel for $50.00.  anything in 500 or 1000 series size now that the friggin siennas ara 60 bucks ridiculous."
1013729,Duckie,2017-09-19 12:51:00,305,"if you are determined to stay brand new, another option for $200 is the Shimano Ultegra. its a stradic minus one bearing. it also has the direct drive (screw in) handle that the stradic has but that the cheaper shimano's don't.  I have played with this reel in store and it is awesome. about $70 less than a Stradic."

1013734,captpierre,2017-09-19 15:08:00,2521,Look at the Shimano website. They have reworked their better reels with new technology in last year or two. Lots of new stuff. Like NASCI. Maybe gimmicky but likely not. They make good stuff.
1013766,Musky Plug,2017-09-19 19:53:00,398,"I'm throwing another ticket in for the stradic, I own one and it's definatley worth the extra cash. Also used the NASCI all weekend on my last trip definitely worth considering as well. If you're looking for something a bit cheaper the new Sedona is pretty decent. Picked one up for the gf and I've used it a few times, also worth a look."

1013837,J Roelofsen,2017-09-20 21:16:00,84,"I've been using the 40 size spooled with 25lb braid for Chinook this season, best reel I've used for that application hands down  For spinning reels I used to be a Shimano fan but switched to purchasing mostly Pfluegers a few years back as they offered better performance and value. These new Abu's are again a step ahead of Pfluegers (both Pure Fishing companies) in bang for your buck IMO. Still love the Patriarch and Supreme XT's for lightweight setups tho...  I haven't torn down one of the Abu's yet but I'm guessing the internals are similar to the Pfluegers, simple and reliable. As someone who does their own reel maintenance and servicing what that means to me is less things to break, wear out or go wrong when compared to other manufacturers  Josh"
1013839,grimsbylander,2017-09-20 21:21:00,3016,Pfluegers are good reels but I'd argue they offer better performance than Shimano.
1013848,huzzsaba,2017-09-20 22:06:00,884,"I am still using budget rod/reels made by shimano.  The most used is my shimano Zuraca 2500 reel which surprisingly only has one ball bearing in it.this combo came came with a 6.6 medium power rod and sold for anywhere from $35-40. Toobad its discontinued now and veryhard to find.   Have caught 4 big 15-20 lb salmon on it , as well as many other fish.(knock on wood) hope it lasts a long time!  The drag is amazing and very smooth reel.  I can only imagine how good the higher end reels are!"

1014070,Sinker,2017-09-23 16:10:00,8692,"I have lots of OLD shimano spinning reels that still work perfectly to this day. I have 2 pfleugers that dont work any more. I really liked the pfleugers when I got them, but they just don't hold up like a shimano does.  I have a few diawas that are tough too.  For me its all about getting gear that can take a beating. If it doesn't last, I don't want it, especially reels. I can get away with cheaper rods, but the reel is important.  S."
1014072,manitoubass2,2017-09-23 17:12:00,11391,"Yep. I have two pfluegers and awesome reels outta the box but mine bit the dust after 3-4 seasons  CI4 is hands down my best reels, but those stay in the boat and don't take a beating like my shorefishing reels do  For shorefishing my best reels are okuma avengers, only like $40-$50 and take a heavy beating and still work like the day I bought them. I'd highly recommend them for shorefishing or even for the kiddos rods(if they still make them that is)"
1014133,J Roelofsen,2017-09-24 19:05:00,84,"Maybe I'm just lucky with the Pfluegers I have. Or maybe it's the winter maintenance  that all my abused reels get   I havent had a Pflueger spinning reel fail me yet  I did have a freind that was about to throw out a 5-6yr old President that was locking up on the retrieve, gave it a 5min clean and lube and he said it was better than new.

1014207,Lape0019,2017-09-25 14:43:00,647,"Congrats on the Pflueger Supreme XT. It is a wicked reel. Dad has had his for at least 4 years and still loves it. He doesn't maintain it at all and it is still going strong. I will say though I doubt he uses it the same way we do.  I was extremely impressed with it when he bought it (well, I picked it out for him) and to this day, it is still smooth as silk. I just prefer my stradics."

If you can fund a used one in your price range, you could always send it out for a cleaning and Shimano will replace any worn pieces while in there.  If you are looking for new, I bought my father a Pflueger Supreme XT a few years ago and it is really nice to use as well. He loves it and the few times I've used it, I can't complain either."

Watch the classifieds, have cash in hand and don't dicker when the price is right just jump on it.  If it weren't for that, I'd still be fishing with ugly sticks!
