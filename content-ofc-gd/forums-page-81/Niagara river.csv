Last Sunday and this morning I've finally had time to hit the water with my son. Last Sundaymorning we we vertically jigging smalljaws. Not big numbers, but a dozen odd respectable fish.   THis morning we were on the lower river and it was a tough bite. 4 fish tween 3 of us, but all quality. Biggest fish goes to my 73 year old mother with a 26"" walter. I pulled another walter at 22"" and the son popped 2 small jaws."
