1014206,Sterling,2017-09-25 14:43:00,477,"Title, looking for recommendations on a wide aluminum boat for trolling medium to large sized lakes. I like a wide transom boat as this allows room to negotiate riggers etc.  Reason being my boat has been destroyed and I'm shopping for a replacement (lol).  Edit for more details:  - Would prefer wide gunwales. - I generally fish with 1 or 2 people."
1014213,John,2017-09-25 15:16:00,2956,"Maybe a little more information would help. Budget, new or pre-owned, full console and top, power etc? Sometimes this topic is a little like the Ford, Chevy, Dodge debate. You will get lots of opinions. Go out and look at many, reduce it down to a few based on your personal criteria and then do a little more research/ask questions to narrow it down to one or two.  Good luck, John"
1014214,KraTToR,2017-09-25 15:19:00,506,"This ^^^^  Plus - Deadrise is also something to consider. Sure, width is indicative with stability but in bigger water, having a high Deadrise (deep V) will be just as important.  Take a bass boat for example.  Plenty wide but a nightmare in big waves.  Regarding wide gunwales, absolutely - especially with riggers but these come at a cost.  Without getting into to much detail, it looks like you should have a look at the Lund impact 1775 or larger.  I recall taking a 1875 for a test run and was very impressed with the layout and stability."
1014215,OhioFisherman,2017-09-25 15:33:00,6623,Tiller or side console?  
1014224,porkpie,2017-09-25 16:53:00,2521,"Starcraft Superfisherman 17 would meet your requirements.  I have the 18, and it's near perfect for a trolling boat in my opinion."
1014227,dave524,2017-09-25 17:08:00,4508,"I ran one of these for over 20 years, except I had an 90 V4 Johnson and a 9.9 Rude on the back trolling the Big O for salmonoides and Erie for eyes with riggers and multiple rodholders for other lines, as a strictly troller I'd prefer this layout to the dual console fishing boats. The front deck was only used for a big cooler and the front seat socket for a planer board mast and a bimini.  It had good interior depth and ran rougher water well for a tinner.  http://centerpointeservice.com/boats-for-sale/1983-sylvan-18ft-center-console-pewaukee-wisconsin-5792742/?print=1&full=1"
1014228,BillM,2017-09-25 17:17:00,17367,There are a few Lund tiller models that would fit the bill.

Go out and look at many, reduce it down to a few based on your personal criteria and then do a little more research/ask questions to narrow it down to one or two.  Good luck, John  I'd go up to 20-22k, pre-owned. Too much premium on new boats.  This ^^^^  Plus - Deadrise is also something to consider.

1014234,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-25 17:55:00,8243,I am considering selling my StarCraft Superfisherman 190. A lot of boat for the money. 115 and matching 15 HP Merc. Mariners.
1014235,dave524,2017-09-25 18:31:00,4508,"West coast style boats with forward consoles and a big dance floor at the back tickle my fancy for trolling with lots of toys on the transom, don't see these Lunds and Smokers here much but I like  http://www.lundboats.com/boat-models/1800-sport-angler/  http://www.smokercraft.com/showroom/2017/americanangler"
1014254,OhioFisherman,2017-09-25 23:20:00,6623,"Sterling, they make that boat in a side console model, as I recall Lew from the board had one. Every boat mfg probably makes a similar boat, I had a Smokercraft 17 pro angler, but it was a 1987 and only 73 inches wide, that extra foot plus wider on newer boats of the same style makes a huge difference."
1014329,Rizzo,2017-09-26 22:55:00,4754,When I was looking for a boat I found Smoker Craft had some very wide models...but they lacked in other details. I ended up buying an Alumacraft...not as wide but far more sturdy. Neighbour of mine bought the Smoker craft I had considered and he is not overly pleased with how it handles
