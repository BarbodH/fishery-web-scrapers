1013530,Dutch01,2017-09-16 16:33:00,1431,"Imo, old school caps look bad on new trucks, even if painted. It's a style thing, it just doesn't look right. If these are 2014 or newer caps destined for the style of my truck for $200 (or even $1200) I'd be all over that of course.  When my truck is ten years old I'm sure I'll be less concerned about style too."

1013414,Dutch01,2017-09-14 20:55:00,1431,Just looking for some opinions from cap people. I have a 2015 Silverado with the Undercover Flex Tonneau cover. It's a low profile trifold and it's pretty convenient. I'm happy with it but it's not going to last forever.  The main reason I'm looking at caps is the ability to sleep in one. Anyone use theirs for sleep? I'm curious if it's worth it because caps are crazy expensive.
1013415,misfish,2017-09-14 20:59:00,29133,"I have the tunno cover. It,s nice, but when I find a cap for the truck, it,s going on, I want for the same reason as you.  And yes, they are priced dearly."
1013416,leaf4,2017-09-14 21:00:00,2466,"Depending on how often you plan on using it to sleep in, and if you intend on leaving it on the truck...

1013423,Dutch01,2017-09-14 21:43:00,1431,The problem with the truck tents as I see it is you have to take everything out of the truck first to set it up. A FlipPac would be great if I were building an expedition truck. I just want to throw an old air mattress in the back. Never slept in one though so not sure what the cons are.
1013425,Raf,2017-09-14 22:24:00,3495,If you never use the truck bed to carry large items that would otherwise not fit with a cap on then I think a cap make sense. Taking off the cap to move a fridge would be a giant pita where a tonneau is pretty easyto remove. But if you don't need the bed space why not just get a SUV?   Edit: there's also these https://www.softopper.com

1013437,Dutch01,2017-09-14 23:31:00,1431," My ice fishing sleds (yes plural, and no, not the kind with a motor) barely fit under the tonneau now.

I just layer them along the side, over the wheel well and back of the box. Once the cold comes, they set in place. Never move.  With a cap, I could make a frame for patio stones to lay on the bed.."
1013440,Terry,2017-09-14 23:40:00,14456,my portable hut did not fit under my  tonneau cover nor did my toon now i have a cap
1013441,Raf,2017-09-14 23:44:00,3495,Lol I have no problem saying no.  I've only owned my truck for a few weeks and found a need to remove the tonneau and load it up above the roof line a couple of times for my own personal use - two minutes to pop it off and two to put it back on and I can do it solo - but if you guys don't then a cap makes sense. I kind of like the idea of the softtopper for me but not sure how durable the canvas would be.

1013459,lew,2017-09-15 08:58:00,12766,I normally use an Xtang Tri-Fold hard tonneau but when we travel and carry alot of bulky stuff I figured a cap would be much better for the extra room.  I only use it a few times a year so bought a used one in excellent condition from Easton Truck Caps on hwy 115 for a great price and then had a local body shop paint it to match the truck.  Plenty of room inside now and has sliding windows with screens for extra ventilation.    I built a frame work at the back of the yard hidden behind the garage and I can easily remove the cap or re-install it myself in about 30 minutes and the Xtang goes back on in 5 minutes.   
1013469,Dutch01,2017-09-15 12:01:00,1431,"That looks like the perfect setup, Lew. Sadly I'm in an apartment in the city so no room to have both (I already keep my kayak in my living room!)"
1013481,GBW,2017-09-15 15:13:00,8460,When I would play in ball tourney's I'd just drop the tailgate and leave it open with a tarp covering the open end and I'd sleep under the cover I had.  Now the (now ex) refused due to the trapped feeling as the cover isn't too far from you...  If you are not afraid of the space then why spend more...  And yes USED is a good option.  I found snow tends to build up between cap and the back window of the truck when I had a cap.
