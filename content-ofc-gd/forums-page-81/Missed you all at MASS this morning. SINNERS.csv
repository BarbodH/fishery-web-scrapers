I used to go out from hooters and go down there, but resident pass don't count in that lot. Go figure. Plus I knew it was going to get hot fast, and really didn't want the long row back.  Ah the days of fishing and hunting cut short do to hockey. Been there with 2 boys."

If you're open to suggestions, try to raise your camera and tilt it downwards so that we can still see you but we'll be able to see the fish thrashing at your feet as well. I remember you losing a few fish at your feet recently."

They thought I was CRAZY!  But just think of it, a car jack wit with a rod, and  the corners 2x4 had hole drilled into them, put the jack in and crack it up. can be done alone and I have done it!  Thinkers."
