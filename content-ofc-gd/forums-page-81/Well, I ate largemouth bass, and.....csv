Caught 2 nice keepers (1.5lbs or so) and put the fillets in a beer/egg mixture, then into garlic and butter fish crisp. Fried in vegetable oil over the coleman stove and ate them up with my cousin on our campsite. Memorable meal for sure. I remember some folks on here mentioning to stay away from the belly meat, and I can see why now. I tried a bit of it didn't care for it. The fillets were fantastic, no grubs to be found. I'll be eating more of them in future for sure!"

1013592,mike rousseau,2017-09-17 18:03:00,4661,Lmao!!!  Now that I re-read that I should have worded it better  ?
1013663,AKRISONER,2017-09-18 15:51:00,5558,i havent laughed out loud at a forum post in a while...but this one got me
1013673,Governator,2017-09-18 17:25:00,879,Tried SMB but for whatever reason (probably my cooking) it tasted very greasy.  The one time I cut in to a LMB it had grubs in them and decided there are a lot better options for a feed so I don't bother with bass anymore.  Was in Temagami on the weekend and grilled walleye over the fire with a little spice around midnight.  Was delicious.  Not worth doing a report but here's a pic or two.    
1013682,blaque,2017-09-18 18:42:00,2419,"I dont keep a ton of fish to eat........basically walleye only a couple times a year. Having said that, i was with a large group in the 1000 islands and everyone insisted we bring back some fish for ""fry-day"" and smallmouth were the target for the weekend so a buddy and I  brought some back and cleaned them up for the group.  All the while, kinda rolling our eyes as we cleaned these fish , after all these were not eyes' or perch we were about to put on their plates.  So, later that evening......the smallmouth came out the fryer......and everyone was raving how delicious it was. Sure enough, i dug in and low and behold........it was freakin outstanding. Whoda thunk....."
1013683,Joeytier,2017-09-18 18:42:00,3990,I'll have to give them a shot next time i get into some smaller ones.

1013719,HTHM,2017-09-19 02:49:00,4082, As good as muskie? No they taste more like Pike.
1013720,manitoubass2,2017-09-19 03:20:00,11391, Sorry in advance for the crappie post
1013748,AKRISONER,2017-09-19 16:21:00,5558,Pike or grass pickeral? Or american pickeral aka Walters? Lol  Sorry in advance for the crappie post

1013815,jimmer,2017-09-20 15:11:00,2730,"I think many people have starting keeping bass in the Kawarthas, due to the difficulty in catching walleye for a meal."
1013856,gordy28,2017-09-20 23:43:00,638,"At one of the lodges we visited at the mid week fish fry there is a blind taste testing that's a tradition All fish are breaded and battered and fried.  You sample 1 to 4 pieces that were supposed to be pike, walleye, bass and whitefish. You eat , guess and rank each piece. My favorites blind ended up being Small mouth (swore it was walleye) pike then walleye and finally whitefish Turned out there was no whitefish and my least favourite was also pike lol. Now I have have bass and walleye grilled and much prefer walleye but think the lesson learned was fried right.  They all taste the same He said people are always amazed that a) they choose something other than walleye and  they can't really tell the difference Cheers Gordy"
1013871,AKRISONER,2017-09-21 11:27:00,5558,The way my family has always cooked fish definitely shows the difference a lot more. Pike is definitely stronger tasting than walleye. Bass the meat is slightly different.  Im not much of a fish eater so when i do i try to simply hit the fish with some hires and throw it on the fire as is. If im doing this its gotta be walleye.
1013875,Sinker,2017-09-21 14:02:00,8692,I've shocked many people with bass and pike that thought it was walleye. Any FRESH fish is good....if you like fish.  S.

Try pan fried, baked or steamed and you will taste the diff."
1013884,manitoubass2,2017-09-21 16:19:00,11391,Yep  And bass is still gross lol
