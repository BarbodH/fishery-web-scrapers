1013494,bassfighter,2017-09-15 17:24:00,366,"I actually posted it on 5 fishing  board plus Kijiji. I have a feeling the odds are high to find its owner. The Owner ends up being a member here.  The Owner has picked up the rod and reel combo and J -13 crankbait on monday.  Thanks for all your kind word.   THANKS TO THE OWNER, FOR THE TIMMY""S GIFT CARD AS A REWARD!"
1013499,aplumma,2017-09-15 18:59:00,6896,Good on you for trying t find its owner.  Artt

1013502,jimmer,2017-09-15 20:01:00,2730,Good on you!
1013564,huzzsaba,2017-09-17 01:50:00,884,Thanks Bassfighter. I did leave my backup rod reel combo there.  Very kind of you to try and find the owner.  Sent you a PM.
1013567,cheaptackle,2017-09-17 03:03:00,849,One of you had better post if this turns outl!  The suspense is killing me - if H really does get his gear back from BF this is gonna be one of those one in a million stories!  Well?  I'm waiting....   (LOL)  Michael
1013572,Rizzo,2017-09-17 12:36:00,4754,I may have lost around a hundred different combos out that way so I am going to send you a hundred different descriptions  In all seriousness would be neat if you could find the true owner
1013578,huzzsaba,2017-09-17 14:32:00,884,Its confirmed that its mine. Just waiting for my friend in North York to pick it up for me.
1013583,ketchenany,2017-09-17 16:38:00,3229,"Some great people out there. Send a thank you reward   many years ago getting into a boat in Medford In rough water I dropped a plastic lure box, down between two large boulders, box opened as it hit, gone! One of the guys I was with felt for my loss. I had to borrow to fish  A few months later I get a call and asked if  I wanted my lures back! I asked him how can this be? HE was able to get a powerful magnet and went back, lowered it between the boulders and scooped them all out, he was sorry for the box!"
1013603,bassfighter,2017-09-17 20:24:00,366,"Owner is coming to pick up the combo on monday.  There were more people that passed by that rod combo, when it was left behind, if I did not pick it up after I finish fishing, it would have been gone."
1013604,leaf4,2017-09-17 20:44:00,2466,Awesome!
1013617,huzzsaba,2017-09-18 00:11:00,884,"Owner is coming to pick up the combo on monday.  There were more people that passed by that rod combo, when it was left behind, if I did not pick it up after I finish fishing, it would have been gone. When I got home, I realized in the pile of rods that mine was missing.  I had a feeling someone trustworthy would find it and make the effort to return it back.  For this I am truly thankful!"
1013678,huzzsaba,2017-09-18 18:16:00,884,"My friend picked up the rod today.Ketchenany, thanks and yes done."
1013790,misfish,2017-09-19 22:49:00,29133,"If it aint yours, it aint yours. Thankfully in today's age, we have the web. Back before the web, it was kept and nothing said.  Glad both parties, enjoyed the ending.  I found a drill/auger set up last year. Oh I tried it out during my outing, but soon posted when I got home, in the lost and found on fishing sites. Found the owner. Nothing was asked for a reward.  KARMA"
