1013613,limeyangler,2017-09-17 23:27:00,5204,"Hi all, headed up to Lac Seul on Friday to shoot some birds and catch some fish. The grouse were playing shy but I got lucky on the way out when I spotted 3 right at the landing, did not see another single grouse apart from those. I wanted to target bass and they did not disappoint. I also target some walleye which were less enthusiastic than the bass but abundant none the less. The Bass were shallow, the walleye deep and the grouse DELICIOUS!   "

I picked one up at a swap meet and will be trying it this fall They are fantastic. great for in my minnow tank too to separate species/sizes of minnows, I have three of them. They also came in handy in the tropics, good to keep fresh caught live bait in, or even transport while wading. The fact they fold down to nothing is great too.  another rough day for day, huh?  wicked bass spot  where's those drone shots? so cool when you spliced those in with that scenery   It was drizzling on and off, the drone is not weather proof so decided to leave it at home."
