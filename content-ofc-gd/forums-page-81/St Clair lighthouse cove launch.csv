1014112,Carp,2017-09-24 11:43:00,1488,"Well done ! Never fished Lake St.Clair, but it's on the bucket list. I have a lot of buckets ! "
1014113,Rizzo,2017-09-24 12:27:00,4754,Right on! Did you head out in the lake or just fish the rivermouth/channel heading out?
1014282,Kaytar,2017-09-26 13:12:00,7,nope def fishing out in the lake...spoke to several boats and very few even had a hit that day...maybe to hot and super flat..fishing into the dark as well...all in all a fun day!
