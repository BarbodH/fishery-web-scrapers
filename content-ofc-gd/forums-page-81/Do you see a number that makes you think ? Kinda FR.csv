I could go to a shrink and you guys would never know about this, but,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  It,s been driving me crazy.  For the past 3 months or so, I have seen 2 sets of  numbers on the stove clock, bed clock,truck clock. The bed side one freaks me out, as I wake up and there the number stares right at me.  4:44.  Mostly  in the AM,  Sometimes I see 2:22  Which adds up to 4:44  I have been searching these numbers on the web and nothing comes up as a meaning.  I can tell you for sure, the number 4.44, is a number that means something to me.  When I was doing bass tournys, I won big fish on Six Mile. Small mouth weighing, 4.44 lbs  Why is this number haunting me?  Is it a sign?  There is no way I am going to buy another bass boat and fish tournys again.   It,s driving me loonie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  My next search for this number,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  Is the Bible     I'm just thankful, there is no 666      "

1014092,fishing n autograph,2017-09-23 23:06:00,2540,I always see 11:11... different theories but really it's your.m brain looking at the clock and thinking there's something going on when there isn't. Synchronicity

1014101,ketchenany,2017-09-24 01:03:00,3229,"Brian if you were Chinese you're in deep poo! Here  is good one for you. I worked for an agency, we had the Lexus account and always had one in the garage to look at or use with permission. Licence plates Lexus 1, 2, 3 and 4! We had 4! The account exec wanted to use it as his Toyota was in the shop. He was  Chinese, amazing guy. The marketing VP asked him are you sure you want to us this one. LEXUS 4, NO problem. HE takes his wife to dinner at Bayview Village came out of the restaurant at 10 pm and it was gone! HE thought he had misparked it but after a while York' finest showed up and went to the spot and all they found was the lock on the pavement. A Alexus LS 400 with a plate LEXUS 4 was never found!  Change to a analog clock!"
