My nephew's prop on his 75 hp Mercury hasn't been hit or anything; it's just starting to get ratty around the edges with a bunch of hairline cracks starting. Figured I'd get it fixed for him before one of those cracks turns into a chunk missing. Or does anyone have a recommendation for another shop?  Dan. "
1011921,AKRISONER,2017-08-23 12:20:00,5558,i feel like a replacement prop on a boat that size would cost nearly the same to get one repaired. I recently picked up a prop for $110 shipped out of the states

1011945,DanD,2017-08-23 15:40:00,2223,Thank you ^^^^
1011947,AKRISONER,2017-08-23 15:52:00,5558,wasnt meant as a negative dan! i just feel like to get anyone to fix anything these days it costs half of what a brand new one costs...its crazy.  I hope these guys help you out.
1011952,DanD,2017-08-23 16:24:00,2223,Negative? I didn't take it that way; always open too suggestions.  Dan

1011955,mistaredone,2017-08-23 18:37:00,913,City Wide did a shredded pro and a broken skeg a few years ago for me.  Great price and the prop and skeg still look new today
1011985,lowerunit,2017-08-24 00:14:00,53,Just had mine done at City Wide.  I am assuming yours is a stainless prop.Minimum $150 for repair does great work and timely.
1012013,DanD,2017-08-24 16:20:00,2223,Thanks guys will check them out.  Dan.
1012017,OhioFisherman,2017-08-24 16:47:00,6623,"A spare prop isn't a bad thing to keep in the boat, even if it's not an expensive one. You can waste a lot of time looking for a replacement on a vacation."
1012035,Chuck Enwinde,2017-08-25 04:51:00,247,"Another vote for Citywide, though it's listed as Citywide Propeller Repair now.  Buddy took off most of his skeg and most of two blades.  He ordered a new prop and went to Citywide to get the skeg repaired.  For no additional charge he fixed the prop that my buddy assumed was toast.  Within a couple hours of dropping it off it was as if it never happened."
1012036,DanD,2017-08-25 11:05:00,2223,OK you guys talked me into it; Citywide it is. LOL It's not going to be busy here at the shop today and the 50 Chevy needs to stretch her legs and blow the cobwebs out her exhaust. All I have to say is.  ROAD TRIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Dan.

1014306,DanD,2017-09-26 16:36:00,2223,An update on the prop repair. Just opened the box that Citywide Prop Repair had sent the prop back to me in. The thing looks brand new; no signs of weld marks and the curvature of the blades all look exactly the same. Very happy with the way it turned out. $69 bucks taxes in. Welders here in town won't turn their welders on for less then a $100.00! Thanks to all that suggested having the prop repaired by Louie.  Dan.
1014331,DRIFTER_016,2017-09-26 23:06:00,10439,Told ya they do stellar work. Do great work rebuilding skegs too.
