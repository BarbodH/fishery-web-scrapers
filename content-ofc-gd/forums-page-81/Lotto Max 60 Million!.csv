A few street rods and a place to store.  I also need to buy a buddy his Corvette and my other buddy a blown bass boat. He already has the blown bass boat so likely what the vette cost in cash.   The only waste of money totally un necessary I would buy a bad ass backhoe I mean everything with a float and dump truck snow blower ,mowers, posthole digger, brush hog everything.

I know an older guy, lets call him ""Fred"", who won $1 million and quit his job within minutes of finding out he won. The next day Fred went to claim the money and was denied as there was a lawsuit filed against him by a family member who claimed that Fred told them he would give them money if he ever won the lotto. It took 8 or 9 months for everything to get sorted out and he finally received his money. Fred's employer refused to rehire him so he was forced to work a near minimum wage job until he received his money and could finally retire.  Do NOT tell anyone you will give them money if you ever win as you'll be forced to pay up if they can prove you said this. Do NOT tell anyone you have won until your check clears."

By the time you buy your new house, cottage, vehicles and boat there'd be nothing left and you'd have to keep working to be able to afford the taxes, insurance and upkeep. Also, there wouldn't be 60 x $1,000,000 prizes as there'd be far less people buying the tickets as winning $1 mill is far less appealing than the chance of winning $50-60 million."
