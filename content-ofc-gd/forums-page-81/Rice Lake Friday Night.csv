Anyways we managed to land two Nice keeper eyes one measuring 18"" and the other at 15"". We also had 2 over the slot limit which were safely released and 2 that got away because my brother in law decided it was a good idea to leave the net at home! Not one single crappie all night we fished till about 5am and then decided to leave for the creek. We got to the creek suited up and rigged up by 6am after an hour fishing our favourite pool my dad lands a beauty bow on the most smelliest roe bag i ever smelt in my life LOL. After that nothing much was really happening for us, we hooked into a couple salmon but couldn't seem to land them without a Net  , so we decided we needed some sleep and we still had fish to clean when we get home!
