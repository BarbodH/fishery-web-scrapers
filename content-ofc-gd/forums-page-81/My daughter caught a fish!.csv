1013959,OhioFisherman,2017-09-22 02:51:00,6623,"She says it was a black tipped shark? I can only tell it is some kind of shark. She lives on Florida's east coast, a far cry from the bluegill and bass she used to catch! LOL"
1013960,manitoubass2,2017-09-22 02:54:00,11391,Well I know nothing about sharks lol  Just threw a dart there hahahah  Awesome catch nonetheless!!!!
1013962,OhioFisherman,2017-09-22 03:07:00,6623,"LOL, I'm surprised she got that close to it! Never fished in saltwater myself, and never had a desire to. Live release!"
1013978,jimmer,2017-09-22 13:27:00,2730,NICE! That would be so cool to catch one of those.
1013981,OhioFisherman,2017-09-22 14:03:00,6623,"jimmer, I have no idea what kind of tackle they were using, but she said it peeled out like 250 yards of line and took her 40 minutes to land, she didn't want to catch two in a row! Powerful fish? Just imagine a big one?"
1014021,jimmer,2017-09-22 18:58:00,2730,"Cool, I can feel the arms burning."
1014032,aplumma,2017-09-22 20:26:00,6896,Very cool Shark fishing is a blast. We spent many nights sitting on the beach with a fire going until we got a pull down. The whole area is black and you have no idea what you are fighting until you get it in the surf.   Art
1014034,spincast,2017-09-22 20:54:00,3279,"very cool    shark's pretty tasty, too"
1014035,misfish,2017-09-22 20:59:00,29133,Sweet fish. Grats to her.

I have eaten shark fillets, Mako I believe, it wasn't bad. She lives about as far from the Big O and Stick Marsh as I do from Cedar Point, if i could get around I know where I would be visiting!"
1014104,FloatnFly,2017-09-24 01:44:00,1640,"That's awesome, you brought her up right,  That is a black tip shark,  black tipped fins is how they get their name.  Very powerful animals."
1014107,OhioFisherman,2017-09-24 02:47:00,6623,"Float, just from what I see on wiki that is a pretty small one, I can only imagine how long a 150 - 250 pound one would keep you busy for?  LOL, no credit to me, i am sure fishing for them was her guys idea!"
1014212,PUMP KNOWS,2017-09-25 15:08:00,937,Congrats and it was a shark too!?
1014278,Hank Jr,2017-09-26 10:16:00,146,Nice fish maybe now she will take Dad shark fishing
1014284,OhioFisherman,2017-09-26 13:21:00,6623,"Nice fish maybe now she will take Dad shark fishing  LOL, it's a nice thought, but dad knows his limitations! My fishing days are over!"
