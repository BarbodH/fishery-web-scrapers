I have to start with saying how darn hot it was, which eventually sent these two older guys to shore in search of shade. The super hot pepperette didn't help. LOL We started off like gangbuster, but eventually came down to earth.  The smallies seemed to be on and we caught 4 of those on unlikely structure in the first hour.  Caught 4 of them on a chug bug and added one later on a fluke.  We did get some largemouth to add to the total.  Not bad for an afternoon of fishing. "
1013888,DJGeneral,2017-09-21 18:04:00,163,i commend you on going out in this heat! Nice smallie too!
1013889,AKRISONER,2017-09-21 18:05:00,5558,im shocked you were getting em on the chug...was fishing stoney last weekend and couldnt get a sniff on the top water. Nice to see the south end of the lake producing...but smallies? even more confusing lol   well done!
1013893,jimmer,2017-09-21 18:20:00,2730,"Yes, it's mind boggling.  I hadn't done well with surface baits unless it was in the evening, so it was strange to see midday surface bites."
1013921,Sinker,2017-09-21 21:18:00,8692,"I was out yesterday afternoon too. Fished 3 hours, drank 4 bottles of water, caught 3 musky, and got cooked! I hate this heat. 75 degree surface temp... say what? The fish seemed to not mind....  S."
1013932,misfish,2017-09-21 22:16:00,29133,"Ok, Im trying to figure out this, You guys got hot,baked. I was on Simcoe  yesterday morning til 11am. Rollers still from the N/E. Breeze was coming from the E/S.  Started to calm by 10:30. Oh wait, you guys are the afternoon shift fishers. LOL  Nice fish jimmer. Top water hit will get better I like the small spooks myself. Just a light side to side motion to them. No need to wake up the hood with splashing baits."
1013950,OhioFisherman,2017-09-22 01:40:00,6623,Nice! Ya hot! 92f here at 2pm broke an almost 90 year old record.
1014042,Sinker,2017-09-22 22:43:00,8692,"Some of us had to work the day!!! LOL  I love fishing after work though. Hot or not....its my therapy. The 3 muskies didn't hurt either. 30, 37, and 44"" ers....not a bad way to spend 3 or 4 hours. The sunset was absolutely gorgeous that night too!!"
1014194,jimmer,2017-09-25 13:36:00,2730,"Well, I couldn't get near that spot on the weekend.  I get the sense people watch me with binoculars. LOL"
