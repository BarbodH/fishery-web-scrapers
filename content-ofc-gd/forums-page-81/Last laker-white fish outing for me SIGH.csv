One could not ask for better conditions to be floating out on a toon. Next Saturday is the closer on Simcoe for these fish. I,ll pass on that and go play with some fall bass and look for some fall perch. Thats if fall ever gets here. My goodness. It was 28 deg by 10:30 this morning. Any other time, I would be wearing my neoprene's and a hoodie out there.  The season opens up Jan 1st. Lots of other fish to chase til then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,       "
