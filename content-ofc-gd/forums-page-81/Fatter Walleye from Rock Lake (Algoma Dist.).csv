Fishing seems best so far in 9-15 feet of water pulling perch/fire tiger spinners with GULP, minnows or worms behind them.  Heres my buddies 5 pounder   Here he is with his 5 and 3 pounder...   Heres my Fathers Day 21""er caught on a Baitfish Image Clown Spinner and my new Mojo Bass...Mojo Bass...not just for Bass anymore   . "
356558,Leecher,2009-06-29 00:49:00,7832,Real nice eyes archie.... Congratulations and thanks for sharing Leechman
356573,bucktail,2009-06-29 01:27:00,1857,"Nice eyes! Bet you like that Mojo rod, got one last yearand am really impressed with them for there price and performance."
356589,Dara,2009-06-29 01:46:00,3052,Nice catch Archie..just remember...Rock Lake fish are fairly toxic. Don't be eating the big ones
356600,archie_james_c,2009-06-29 02:13:00,618,  Toxic? Details please..I'm new to this lake...and have loved it so far..but not if I'm eating dirty old garbage pickerel   .
356602,TDunn,2009-06-29 02:18:00,680,Nice fish man but Dara is correct....High mercury levels in rock and surrounding lakes I believe.....I think it is a result from a mining but I could be wrong..The fish consumption guide explains it better but i can not find a copy here.....Hope this helps   TDunn
356624,pike slayer,2009-06-29 03:05:00,1177,"oh ya showing off again eh arch! nice walleyes though, we gotta head out again soon and catch bigger ones then spins 5lber. and i've been told there was a mine shaft or something going under rock and it collasped and theres a really deep spot in the lake. i hear whatever rock they were mining reflects the sun alot and heats up causing the lake to raise to higher temperatures, maybe as a result you get more bacteria in the water do to higher temperature levels. i could be out in left field but thats just what i heard through the grape vine."
356668,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-29 04:55:00,0,eat 1 lbers instead of broodstock and you have nothing to worry about!
356672,archie_james_c,2009-06-29 05:09:00,618," :P     Its a good thing theres lots of 1 pounders in that lake   ....or atleast, thats all I can catch   ."
356679,limeyangler,2009-06-29 07:03:00,5204,"Your really getting into the eyes now AJ.....nice fishes.  They look a bit pale, is the water very stained in that lake? Its just they look very similar in colour to Wabigoon lake walleye where i live, The lake here is the colour of a Timmies Double, Double. We got mercury in our Lake too, but apparently its all on the other side of the mill dam, i think they call the fish WALLEYE, EYE, EYE....genetic deformities....lol.  Great report man......still waiting for one caught on the floating jig though"
356683,archie_james_c,2009-06-29 08:27:00,618,"  The water doesn't seem too bad for clarity Lime. I've been told our area's Walleye are actually some mutant fish/hybrid, but I have no idea nor do I care...  I will bust out the floating jigs soon   . I gotta get them to stop hitting the trolling spinners long enough for me to still fish for a bit   ."
356930,Dara,2009-06-29 22:14:00,3052," Linky http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/en/water/fishguide/guides.php  It doesn't list walleye for Rock right now, but I remember reading years ago that they are pretty bad there. There are some old gold mines upstream..Havilah mine I believe. Stick to eating the smaller ones, if any. There are plenty other lakes to eat from"
357018,pike slayer,2009-06-30 01:48:00,1177,but thats the only lake archie can catch walleyes in!   haha just bugging buddy!
357025,Dara,2009-06-30 02:06:00,3052,  OK..now thats funny
357045,archie_james_c,2009-06-30 04:38:00,618," Thanks Dara, how was your trip?     OUCH!! Next time we're fishing and I land a fish for you, your hooks are gonna get ""tangled"" in the net before the fish is in   ."
357083,Dara,2009-06-30 12:55:00,3052,"Great trip thanks Archie. Newfoundland is a pretty neat place. Saw iceburgs, whales, eagles, the whole works. Gros Morne national park is amazing"

1014169,huzzsaba,2017-09-25 00:32:00,884,"I started reading this thread from the top not paying attention to the date it was posted and I am thinking, I have never seen these many members from sault post on one thread lol. Later realized its from 2009!  Hope you get the answer to your question Pitch55. Sault Folks are great!"
