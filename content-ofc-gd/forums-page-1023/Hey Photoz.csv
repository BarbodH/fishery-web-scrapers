These things, when ya make 'em mad, will sometimes come right up on shore, and attack offending fisherpersons . . . .     this is a VERY dangerous sport . . .     do you have a good stout billy-club, or better still, a side-arm for protection? You need at least ONE high end rod & reel to donate to the carp Gods, before you even start. Do you still REALLY wanna risk it?  P. S. We only use trout or salmon, OVER 10 pounds for bait! Just last week I saw a lady walking a big pit-bull beside some carp infested waters . .     there was just a big splash, several yelps, then erie silence . . . .    no more pit bull!"

I have great memories of fishing with you..."
