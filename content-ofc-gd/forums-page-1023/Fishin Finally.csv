Pike decided not to co-operate much but me and my buddy both had a few really good strikes and a few good fights that didn't end in success, but Ryan did get one little guy  So we figured heck we'll try and get some of the panfish and so we did. Ended up keeping 9, the largest being about 10"", and released a few more. They're going to be some beauties on the BBQ tomorrow. Any recipe ideas? "
