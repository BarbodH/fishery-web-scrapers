207636,Carp,2008-05-28 16:01:00,1488,"I actually get the flyer delivered in my mail box, but it's always nice to go through it again online. Nice for the folks who haven't seen it yet.  Thanks Fang"
207666,BillM,2008-05-28 17:59:00,17367,I think I might pick up one of those $15 rainsuits.
207694,Raf,2008-05-28 19:31:00,3495,ahh.. the incredible crotchless rainsuits.. i'll give ya two hours before they look like this... you can try buying a few sizes too big that hsould help.  i think i went through 4-5 of sets before i dished out the coin on proper bibs.  the jackets will hold up though!

207703,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-28 20:08:00,3761,Love their sales i always find something that is on SALE at basspro. Thanks for the link!!!
208551,Fang,2008-05-30 12:13:00,1330,If anyone's looking for a high end rain suit take a walk over to the shooting gallery. The BPS Gortex stuff is there and last week they had a clearance rack. I picked up a $259 Gortex Pro Qualifier jacket for $170. Had to walk around the store and think about this for a while as that was a lot of cash. So glad I did though.  Raf's pictuire says it all. There is no worse experience fishing than being wet and uncomfortable or cold. As I get older I would rather spend more on clothing myself with the proper gear than getting the latest greatest rod/reel or tackle.
