208512,jace,2008-05-30 07:54:00,472,"  cool.  almost matches the pacific halibut.  The largest i've personally seen are in the 350# range.  the largest I've brought in myself is only 135#.  Although I've never seen pictures, I've heard atlantics several 100#'s heavier are around and have been caught, just not on a rod and reel."
