208105,Rich,2008-05-29 15:44:00,3927,"""All you need is a Panther Martin #2""  These fish are loaded in every spot I have fished so far locally. Gotta love it. I'm not sure if they're stocked or if the last 2 colder springs have just brought awesome year classes, either way brookie fishing is awesome. No live bait required!      "
208110,Musky or Specks,2008-05-29 15:50:00,2710,That middle one is OINK OINK!!!
208148,Reef Runner,2008-05-29 17:10:00,981,Beauty fish.  Job well done Rich!
208150,Roy,2008-05-29 17:14:00,13728,"WTG! Rich, when I was a kid that was almost the only kind of fishing I did. There's a fair amount of specks here. I should give it  a few tries this season. A peaceful pastime and a truly nice fish."
208153,BillM,2008-05-29 17:21:00,17367,"I am jealous...  The stream I went to check out yesterday just didn't hold any deep pools.  So I ended up drowning worms in a muddy river trying to catch bullheads, lol"
208154,jwl,2008-05-29 17:22:00,1056,"nice to see the little speckies like that, little rooster tail type spinners always work pretty good for those  guys..I try to use ones that have brown hair on them, seems to work pretty good and gold colour patterns"
208232,ehg,2008-05-29 20:48:00,2666," You are right brookie fishing is great. They are fine little scrappers and the odd one i ate was super fine. Don't have to lug much just a few spinners and refreshments.  If they are stocked the flesh is lighter in colour. Had to use the Panther Martin #4 on larger waters.(Saugeen, parts of ganny, etc...)  Nice fish,  ehg"
208237,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-29 20:56:00,0,"I also caught my very first seckles yesterday and they were pretty much the same size shown in pictures above.  What is it so special about thm? say, vs rainbow and others?"
208247,steverowbotham,2008-05-29 21:14:00,1800," They are a native species with a lower, more vulnerable population. and they are beauts"
208269,rhare,2008-05-29 21:58:00,387,nice fish!!    Its funny how they seem more elusive then rainbows yet there is a higher keep limit on them ???

208317,Guest robw,2008-05-30 00:07:00,0,Those are nice. It defenitaly makes me want to go to some of my old speckle spots to see if they're still around.
