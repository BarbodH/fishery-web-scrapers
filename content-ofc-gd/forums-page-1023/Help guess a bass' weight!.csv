207537,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-28 11:23:00,1362, .....good one Roy!!
207601,charlesn,2008-05-28 14:33:00,551,"I'd call that hawg an honest 6 all day long.  I might be wrong or an outright liar, but that's what I'd call it!  Charles"
207604,The Urban Fisherman,2008-05-28 14:38:00,2050,"dude that's a big bass - I've seen 22 inch (SKINNY) smallies weigh 6.25lbs and that thing's 23inches....well over 6 in my opinion - probably over 7.  Anybody who tells you it's a 4.5 to 5.5 lber is nuts!  Cheers, UF"
207622,Cudz,2008-05-28 15:22:00,2652,"I am pretty sure that thing has a larger girth than 14"".  I bet you it is 17"".  If that is the case it would be well over 7 pounds."
207625,Reef Runner,2008-05-28 15:28:00,981,I would give it 6.5lbs but no more than 7.
207626,blaque,2008-05-28 15:29:00,2419,"Id say around 6ish  But nevermind the fish, how incredibly tall is the guy who took the picture and likes to stand in mud lol"
207657,Whitemikeca,2008-05-28 17:07:00,138,Nice catch!  I can't wait until bass season opens here dammit.  The bass in my avitar was 7.4 pounds on my digital scale.  I didn't measure the lenght but it looks about similar to yours.  I am 6 foot about 250lbs.  Yours looks a little bit skinner so I would say 6.5lbs or so.
207677,Musky or Specks,2008-05-28 18:27:00,2710,"I caught one that was 23"" on a memorial day weekend in Michigan. It was pretty beat up and skinny from the spawn and on digital scale still weighed 6 lbs 9 oz if I can find the photo I will post it."
207679,solopaddler,2008-05-28 18:31:00,8605,6.4 lb's
207681,Fish Farmer,2008-05-28 18:43:00,2234,7 1/2 LB.s
207761,steverowbotham,2008-05-28 22:35:00,1800,5.5 - 6 pounds
207762,misfish,2008-05-28 22:44:00,29133, Thats the kicker eh chuck.LOL Nice fish.
207775,Puckhead,2008-05-28 23:27:00,377,It's a bucket - 4.5lbs.
207778,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-28 23:30:00,0,Looks like a 5 1/2 lb bass.
207791,setomonkey,2008-05-29 00:27:00,872,"I'd say around 5 to 5.5 lbs based on the size of that mouth relative to your hand and 24"" length.  Nice catch!  Mike"
207897,barracuda,2008-05-29 02:57:00,41,"Thanks for all the input guys. It's unreal how big of a weight difference people put on it. Guess I'll hafta get a digital scale for next time.  In response to a few of the comments: -it was caught way down south in the U.S -it was hooked from an elevated fishing pier/dock thingy and i had to jump down to land it, the camera girl took pics from above -it had a huge head and was long but as many of you have said, it wasn't particularly fat  For now, I'll happily accept it as possibly a PB bass. Thanks again everyone!"
207916,drunksmurf,2008-05-29 03:30:00,5,"I'll say it's an even 10 pounds.  Not because it is 23"", rather 'cause you don't look any more than 5 feet tall.  Who you trying to fool, that's a double digit bass..."
208180,Fisherpete,2008-05-29 18:14:00,1814,6 to 7 lbs would be my guess. Nice fish!
207271,barracuda,2008-05-27 22:53:00,41,"Hey Guys,  Caught this bass legally while down south a few weeks ago on a LC Sammy 85. It was definitely big by my standards but I'm kinda curious as to how much it weighs. I'm 5'11"" and the fish was about 23"" long. Anyone care to guess?    Thanks in advance!"
207272,Raf,2008-05-27 22:55:00,3495,"23"".. but doesnt look super fat.   i'd say 4.5-5.5#  there are probably more qualified people than me to answer your question tho."
207273,Victor,2008-05-27 22:57:00,1609,it's gotta be 5+ ... JMHO
207274,Nemo,2008-05-27 22:57:00,727,4.5 lbs
207277,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-27 22:58:00,3761,"5-6lbs. 23inch is just under 2 feet, thats a long fish even up to me. and it looks fairly chunky....good catch man!"
207283,Mike01,2008-05-27 23:04:00,378,I'd guess around 5
207288,richyb,2008-05-27 23:07:00,774,7.2 lb
207306,Clampet,2008-05-27 23:43:00,1947,"5.25 lbs. Because I am the same height, and caught a smallmouth of that weight, and it looked sorta like the same size as yours."
207313,Rombo,2008-05-27 23:56:00,39,i'd give it 6 lb
207328,johnnyb,2008-05-28 00:06:00,3413,"I would go 4 lbs, 15 ounces...it's broad, but doesn't look terribly fat in the belly....bee-yooo-tiful fish though"
207333,bassmaster4,2008-05-28 00:16:00,801,6.5 pounds about
207339,forrest,2008-05-28 00:21:00,1032,2.5Kg
207340,MuddyWater,2008-05-28 00:22:00,218,4-5 lbs your holding it out far and your elbow is extended  good ol camera trick
207341,Rich Clemens,2008-05-28 00:23:00,3131,Bettin around 5 to 5 1/2 pounds.   Dang nice bass regardless of the weight.
207342,richyb,2008-05-28 00:23:00,774,a roland martin 12 pounder
207348,Clampet,2008-05-28 00:38:00,1947,That'd be 5 1/2 lbs.
207353,barracuda,2008-05-28 00:42:00,41," Lol, no denying that! Wanted a good pic! Tis why I included the fish's length.  Thanks for the guesses so far guys and keep em comin!"
207405,danbouck,2008-05-28 01:34:00,4380,I'd say between 3 and 8 pounds
207407,Mike the Pike,2008-05-28 01:38:00,3421,6 to 8lbs  
207427,sharper,2008-05-28 02:10:00,279,"It looks long but not much girth, so I would say 7lbs."
207479,gone_fishin,2008-05-28 03:39:00,481,"i'd say somewhere around 6ish!, long but not very fat..... nice fish though! Great Catch!"
207489,Cudz,2008-05-28 03:55:00,2652,Wasn't the old calculation length x girth x girth  /  850  ? or something like that?  maybe it was 800.  If your fish was 23 inches long and had a 16 inch girth it would weigh about 7 pounds but that seem high.  Maybe you have to divide by 900. Can't actually remember my guess is 5.5-6lbs
207514,OhioFisherman,2008-05-28 09:29:00,6623,"Down south? Ohio fish 6-6 1/2, south of the Mason Dixon line add maybe a half a pound."
207531,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-28 11:07:00,1362,"Here's a link to a weight calculator.....if you give that fish a girth of 14""...the estimated weight is 5.6lbs....  http://www.ontarioanglerawards.com/Weight.cfm"
207534,Roy,2008-05-28 11:20:00,13728,It really is a fine looking bass.  I no longer trust fish weight calculators. My height and girth puts me at 64 lbs. That's WAY off.
