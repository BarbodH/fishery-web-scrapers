207771,Puckhead,2008-05-28 23:22:00,377,Black/Silver (white?) Perch Clown  The split rings are junk though - it's worth changing them out (along with the trebles) if you are going after bigger fish - they open up in a hurry...
208218,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-29 20:11:00,3761,"Wen't out to the local store and wow a lot of these baits were sold out. I bought 1 for now to try. Thanks for the good tips and the next one i get will be the perch pattern. Will be sure to make a report as soon as i take a nice fishing trip. My next trip is a month from now. Thanks for the info.  Mike     Thats the color i got. The white one, looks like a typical baitfish and will cover most situations.."
208234,misfish,2008-05-29 20:52:00,29133,I like that one .
208274,Billy Bob,2008-05-29 22:09:00,5865, I agree with one exception and that would be on overcast days use a GOLD color lure. This has worked time and time again over the years for me

208319,shane,2008-05-30 00:13:00,652,Get whatever color they have at the store.......then take it home and paint it black.
208321,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-30 00:20:00,3761, I thought black was only good at night.
208327,Crazyhook,2008-05-30 00:31:00,1154,"dark lures dark days, bright lures bright days !"
208333,Burning Babies,2008-05-30 00:39:00,150,"Generally, I think color is far overrated.  My system is usually to purchase a gradient of a couple colors from realistic and subtle to bright and gaudy.  For hardbaits, I usually buy a silver/dark back finish, a white finish, and a predominantly chartreuse pattern.  I make my selection based on overall visibility of the bait, as influenced by water color, clarity, and sunlight.  I'm generally looking for something that that fish can locate fairly easily, but not see clearly enough to pick up flaws."
207362,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-28 01:00:00,3761,I know you need many different colors of lures just wondering if someone has had more success with one color than another on the Rapala X-Rap Shad. Im only getting 1 for now to try out. So what color should i start out with please?  Mainly for large and small mouth bass.
207383,knotaclue,2008-05-28 01:16:00,136,Perch works well for me
207387,bassjnkie,2008-05-28 01:21:00,1101,"I purchased 3, and perch is my fav., it's a classic. The bass in my pond love the perch.  Daniel"
207388,danbouck,2008-05-28 01:22:00,4380,Perch
207390,Greencoachdog,2008-05-28 01:22:00,8163,"If I was going to use it for Pike I'd get the Perch pattern, but the orange one is a consideration too."
207395,MuddyWater,2008-05-28 01:24:00,218,whenever im in doubt i get a blue or bluish colour. all fish like blue
207430,sharper,2008-05-28 02:13:00,279,Can't go wrong with perch pattern.
207449,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-28 02:39:00,698,perch like others have mentioned. I also like firetiger and clown.
207491,HTHM,2008-05-28 03:58:00,4082,Why not wait untill you win the private tourney....I will be sending the winner a shadrap and from the way you're talkin' you got this wrapped up.
207493,kemper,2008-05-28 04:01:00,2232,"I find colour to have almost no effect when it comes to x raps, it seems to be all about the presentation for me."
207494,gone_fishin,2008-05-28 04:02:00,481,"i've caught a few pike and oos largies in the last couple weeks on the perch pattern. clown is another option that usually works well for pike... at least on the lakes that i usually fish it works well.  if you use them as a jerk bait, and not just a straight retreive, any colour should work... they have a great action if worked properly."
207496,GBW,2008-05-28 04:07:00,8460,"Same, and the Storm ThunderStick is good for less $.  The # 76 LUMINOUS GREEN HERRINGBONE for me (other then Perch)..."
207526,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-28 10:52:00,3761," or yes i could do that. got to make a new thread a little closer to tourny time. The old one got pretty big, and we got to do a poll and stuff."
207541,Garry2Rs,2008-05-28 11:34:00,1425,"Here's some theory... In clear water, use baits that match the hatch, baits like Silver, Gold, Olive green, and Perch, etc .. When in doubt match the colour of the bottom, because the bait fish will have adapted to that colour for camouflage. In dirty water use bright colours, Fire-tiger, Clown, Hot Steel, Hot head, Hot Pink etc. On bright days, use metallic finishes. On overcast days there is no sun to activate the metallic finish, so switch to painted bright colours like Chartreuse, Clown, Fire-tiger etc. If I could only have one, I think it would be Silver or Silver Blue."
207562,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-28 12:43:00,698,  Garry-> I aways learn so much from your posts. Thanks for taking the time to share some of your vast knowledge with everyone here. I know I appreciate it.
207564,Reef Runner,2008-05-28 13:04:00,981,"Garry2rs makes a couple great points.  I, as many others here, like perch but would also suggest looking at a hothead colour.  reefrunner"
207579,The Urban Fisherman,2008-05-28 13:42:00,2050,"Hey team mate -  Garry2rs gave some great advice!  I know that like many of us you're on a budget when it comes to buying gear.  So take Garry2rs advice and buy a few different colors to match different scenario's. (over time or course)  I always buy my confidence colors first.  For x-raps I get the silver/black x-rap first because it's a good imitator of most baitfish in the area's that I fish.  So be it a sunny day, rainy day, or wether the water's clear or murky, at the end of the day it still looks like a minnow to any fish it crosses paths with.  Whereas if it's a bright sunny day, in crystal clear water and you've only got a firetiger x-shad...well you get the point....My second choice would be a perch patterned x-shad (which I've seen catch plenty of walleye and pike).  If you're looking for numbers, don't go with a GIANT sized x-shad.  Get a smaller to mid-sized bait.  Bigger fish will eat smaller baits as well, and you'll even catch some smaller fish to keep you going in-between.  And keep in mind, size does matter.  Earlier in the year, your baitfish, and perch etc. are going to be smaller than in the fall so a smaller sized bait might just ""match the hatch"" a little better.  After that it's all about experimentation.  I don't have any x-shads in any other colors right now, but pink x-raps have given me much more success in muddy water than clown...just my experiences though....best thing to do is just keep trying and experimenting.  And even though having different colors for different situations can be important, don't forget about presentation.  Sometime the way you work your bait is the ticket.  So get out there and grab an x-shad.  Work the crap out of it until you start catching some fish with it (and you will eventually figure it out) then you'll gain confidence in it and use it on a regular basis.  I went down south a few weeks back and a buddy of mine said he wasn't going to throw anything but flippin' jigs all day just to get the hang of using them and to build up confidence.  At the beginning of the day I was switching up like crazy, got 1 fish on a spinner bait, a couple more on a swim bait etc. etc.  He wasn't catching much on his jig, missed a few fish, but stuck with it.  By around dinner time (8 hours later) he had finally figured out the bait and in about hour or so he came back a whoped my butt catching fish after fish.  anyways - good luck and keep us posted!  cheers, UF"

207701,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-28 20:07:00,3761,Those are the two colors i have for the x-rap slashbaits. Im thinking silver blue for the first crank than the perch pattern for the second. Thanks for all the info on chooseing color and feel free to keep adding comments.
207708,Dusky,2008-05-28 20:26:00,310,Garry2rs - This is some good info from a novice point of view. Will keep this in mind next time I am on water!
207709,Zubris21,2008-05-28 20:28:00,563,I've had success for pike with clown colour patterns in all types of water.  I've never owned an x-rap in that colour but I would be tempted to get one...  Also I like patterns that imitate baby game fish like perch or bass.
207731,misfish,2008-05-28 21:29:00,29133,"  This one works awwwwwwwsome. If you can find the white one,you got a great combo. The perch one, is I have to say, my fav of all. But I just use it for pike. Very strong baits. I will aggree with others that there are lower costing baits that will work just aswell.  BTW,Buy extra replacement back trebles. They do lose thier fedders.LOL"
