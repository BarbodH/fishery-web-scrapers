207734,misfish,2008-05-28 21:32:00,29133,Want or need a partner ?
207737,Jigger,2008-05-28 21:45:00,1237,"Beat me to it, misfish!"
207739,misfish,2008-05-28 21:48:00,29133,Just by this much. LOL
207873,bucktail,2008-05-29 02:07:00,1857,"Got a patrner but if he doesnt want to I would be happy to have you Brian.  I need 2-3 more quality spots on Muskoka to compete. The limit is no problem but you have to have 2-35 inch fish to win, i usually average 1-2 every second trip. That wont do it."
208038,Muskoka editor,2008-05-29 13:37:00,1,"You can also find some results and photos at the Gravenhurst Banner -- http://www.gravenhurstbanner.com/muskokanews/article/105876 and the Muskokan http://www.muskokan.com/.

208231,musky66,2008-05-29 20:47:00,273,"Anyone notice how the same few anglers place high every year? I have been in it several times- I thought the 5 Pike limit would be a breeze with the time I had put into that Lake- boy was I humbled! My son and I placed as high s 15th one year- took a full stringer of 30"" fish to get there- it is certainly harder than it looks. Mike seems like a nice guy but he sure seems to know the lake better than most. I don't donate my money anymore."
