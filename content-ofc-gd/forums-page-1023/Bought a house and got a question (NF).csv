208031,fishinggeek,2008-05-29 13:20:00,325," I am exactly the same way.  For an insurance policy to be profitable, it must be actuarially fair or better, which inevitably means the consumer loses something to buy ""peace of mind"".  By avoiding insurance altogether, we will all be more wealthy, on average."
208093,kickingfrog,2008-05-29 15:24:00,8333,"Hi Joey, I only read the first couple of responses so I might be covering some of the same ground here.  Don't go with the bank's option. The basics are the banks owns the policy and you pay the premium (good for the bank, bad for you). As stated the bank (if it does pay out in the unfortunate circumstance) will only pay off the balance of the mortgage, your premiums were based on the full amount borrowed(good for the bank, bad for you). A term policy through a life insurance company is owned by you and is based on your health at the time it is written. If your health situation changes the policy is still valid. If your bank owns the policy they may not allow you to continue when your mortgage is renewed (or the new premiums will be based on your new heath situation (good for the bank, not good for you)).  Term insurance is cheaper than permanent insurance and is best used for temporary situations (mortgages, business loans and raising young children). In many cases you can switch all or part of your term policy to permanent at a later date and again it is based on you original health situation.  Disability is much more grey. Get your life insurance situation taken care of first and foremost. If after that, if you think you want/need/ can afford disability insurance get it through an insurance company, not the bank and talk about the options.  Insurance is not a fun topic, no one likes thinking about it. It is necessary however.  In short: get term through an insurance company. If you include house, car and mortgage through one company you can save some cash as well.  I would have responded sooner, but I was fishing.  Rob"
207028,Garyv,2008-05-27 15:07:00,547,"Congrats on the house.  For what it's worth I'm not a mtg lover, and prefer a PLC instead, however what we did was save a whole lot of dollars years ago when we were buying and selling property by using term insurance.  Another way to really save dollars in the long term is to make double payments a month. You will be surprised how much interest you will save and the time duration that it cuts off until paid in full."
207042,fishnsled,2008-05-27 15:43:00,3520,"Everything has been pretty much covered so I'll just add my congrats to you and Paul!  I should add here that I do also have the insurance you are asking about.  Mainly for piece of mind should I have a heart attach, cancer etc the mortgage will be paid off and one less thing to worry about."
207050,icefisherman,2008-05-27 15:53:00,952,"I am against any insurance in general and only buy them when have no other choice...like car insurance....about to renew my mortgage and have never had /will never have insurance on it. Better spend the same amount on paying your mortgage faster  Congratulations on the new house!  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
207058,BITEME,2008-05-27 16:12:00,1969,CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!
207089,Joey,2008-05-27 17:03:00,9122," Thanks Mike, and if it were only $12 per month I'd have no problem with it, but, in fact, it is $170 per month, which I think is almost highway robbery.  I'd be better putting that toward my morgtage each month.  Then on top of that they want the disability at $135.00 per month.  This is why I'm having my second thoughts about it.  Joey"
207091,Headhunter,2008-05-27 17:07:00,5703,"Joey, those numbers are way off the mark! I'm sure that with some investigation, you could do much better than that! HH"
207096,Squid,2008-05-27 17:18:00,1656,Congrats Joey and Paul on buying a new home!!
207097,fishnsled,2008-05-27 17:19:00,3520,"I'd agree with Joe on this as well.  I think I'm paying around $40 a month, I'm with TD."
206568,ketchenany,2008-05-26 17:43:00,3229,"Congrats on the house, great move. I was actually told by the bank not to buy theri insurance i.e. cost was a  and the payout factor. I got a great rate on my own and covers everything just incase something does happen.  Now if we all could ""lock"" in on gas prices"
206572,Entropy,2008-05-26 18:04:00,747,"I choose not to take it, but YES they do pressure you to sign for it.  When I was signing my mortgage, the woman at the bank was getting mad at me for saying NO after each time she went through a different 'talk'.  If I die my life insurance through my employer, will end up covering the cost of my house, my wife will be ok.  In the mean time we have an extra $50 a month to invest in the house or an investment.  If you don't need it get rid of it.  I figure there is a point at which the costs and benefits of life insurance meet. For me that is looked after through my employer and my wife's employer.  We are not worth millions dead, but should be ok if something were to go wrong in our grand scheme of life.  Entropy"
206573,rob v,2008-05-26 18:05:00,535,"mortgage life and disability insuarance through a bank is priced similar to group insurance to keep prices manageable and coverage simple.   Premiums are based primarily on your age, the amount and ammortization of your mortgage and in some cases whether you smoke or not. Typically there aren't alllowances in the premiums for other health aillments ie they don't charge you a premium for less insurable risks like some private policies might.   As someone pointed out, depending on your age at the start of your mortgage the coverage you get vs cost may actually be cheaper than private coverage, but as your mortgage gets paid down your coverage decreases vs the stable premium.  Having said that, most private policies have premiums that increase with age for the same coverage, but your coverage doesn't usually go down.   The other thing about private coverage to keep in mind, once you've got it and you keep your premiums paid you keep it.  With creditor insurance, if you should happen to change homes and take out a new mortgage if it isn't with the same lender/insurance company you may or may not qualify for coverage then - for things like health reasons etc.  In other words private insurance is a bit more portable/flexible. As well, if something should happen, with private coverage your beneficiary gets cash instead of a paid off house - which could be important at a time like that.  Arranging insurance through your bank is usually much simpler than private coverage (one stop shopping).   bottom line, as someone else mentioned, it's not black and white, and not just about cost.  Many people are taking the private insurance route, and many others take their insurance out through their lender.  But you shouldn't feel pressured by your bank - bank's have to be careful about ""tied selling"" , ie. giving their customers the impression their mortgage approval is contingent on you taking their insurance also. Most of the time life insuarnce overage arranged through the bank is supposed to be an optional thing - and if the bank insists that your mortgage be life insured you still have the option of taking out a private policy and assigning if necessary. Just a little insite from someone in the industry.  Rob V ."
206578,Terry,2008-05-26 18:11:00,14456,"way to go on the new house   I don't believe in buying the Mortgage insurance, life insurance is cheaper and I  have disability insurance at work, I told them no thanks the broker said they may not be able to get me a mortgage without it so I said, then I will go else where ......they changed their tune real quick when I said that"
206580,ecmilley,2008-05-26 18:12:00,2163,"congrats on the house, I deal with life insurance, rrsp and debt management on a part time basis if you have any questions shoot me a pm I'll be happy to help ya out"
206582,KyleM,2008-05-26 18:14:00,218,"We needed to put up (I believe) 24% to avoid CMHC so in lots of cases it does not apply. Also, as posted earlier, CMHC has nothing to do with the buyers...all your doing is picking up the bill for your lender.  Joey, I feel for you...All this is new for us and I have a feeling we're about to discover what we needed and what we dont."
206589,fishing n autograph,2008-05-26 18:29:00,2540,"My wife and I thought that it was a good idea to get it...basically heart problems and cancer run in both of our families...so, if one of us gets sick..bye bye mortgage....  My wife's uncle bought a house 295k house and in 2 years had a heart attack...so now he has no more mortgage payments and life is a little easier for him and his family"
206591,BillM,2008-05-26 18:32:00,17367,"Just a sec, he had a heart attack, didn't die and they paid off his mortgage?"
206598,lew,2008-05-26 18:46:00,12767,"Congratulations on the new home Joey, that's really great news !!"
206629,Billy Bob,2008-05-26 19:41:00,5865,"LOTS of info for you to thrash through but the bottom line is if the ""seller"" is pushing hard it's never for your benefit but rather theirs.  Think about it rash-ably, on each mortgage payment you are paying a mortgage insurance  payment that will pay less and less for each month going forward. Now on a  ""Term Life"" insurance policy the payout is the same no matter when you die AND you can do whatever you wish with the money once your second half has moved on to better life unlike a mortgage insurance payment where it has to go to pay off the lender NOT you.  No one has tried to steer you in the wrong direction but this is something you must spend more time on that you realize because the decision can get pricey. DON'T just throw money at a problem but do it rather well inform so you know you have made the best decision possible."
