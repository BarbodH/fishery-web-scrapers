207481,ehg,2008-05-28 03:43:00,2666,Ha Ha! Thats pretty funny I thought this was a post about dead muskies.  The main thing is that the fish excrement is 'organic'

207650,fish_finder,2008-05-28 16:29:00,370,Hatchery waste.....  I've been using that stuff for years on my veggies and annual plants........its actually extremely good fertilizer!
207768,Terry,2008-05-28 23:10:00,14456,"ok I contacted the company and their spokesperson told me they net the muskie  and put diapers on them, they release them , netting them later to remove the diapers and retrieve  the  waste   I asked how long before they can go without changing the diapers they told me depends.....depends  never mind"
207777,Joey,2008-05-28 23:29:00,9122," Hahahahaha, thanks for the laugh Terry  Joey"
207789,ChrisK,2008-05-29 00:14:00,2772,"Joey, Ive been using the stuff for years in the liquid form. Works great for indoor and outdoor plants but does have a slight odour of fish when used indoors......Its not really made out of muskie's though,just a gimic name....but it is is fish fertelizer of some kind for sure..."
