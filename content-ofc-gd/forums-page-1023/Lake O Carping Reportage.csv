There were fish jumping and splashing around all over the place but very few takers.  Last night made last minute plans to go night fishing for carp out east.  Stop #1: Rouge River Park 3AM - Gates Closed, Damn! Walked down, and saw more skunks and racoons down there than we wanted to deal with.  Stop #2: Whitby - again. Killed 2-3 hours here, chummed plenty, stayed until sun rise. Again, no takers. Was getting frustrated at this point.  Stop #3: Pickering - Frenchmans Bay. Went down to the bottom of Liverpool Rd and a couple of other water access points, killed about an hour fishing with again no takers.  Stop #4: Rouge River Park. Lots of people fishing, not many fish caught, and again, skunked. It was about 11AM when we decided to call it a trip.  Where will I get skunked next? Stay tuned for the report...."

208545,Rich,2008-05-30 12:05:00,3927,"No worries Greg. Even the carp down here are still on and off. After a few good days I think they are in for good, then the next 2 days nothing. Need the warmth to stick around a little longer!"
