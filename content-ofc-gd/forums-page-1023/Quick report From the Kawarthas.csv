207157,snagmaster,2008-05-27 19:24:00,250,"Hey guys, Hit the Kawarthas this weekend with my buddy Nick to chase some eyes.......we did alot of chasing but not alot of catching...lol....Fished everything you can imagine...The water temps are still low and the weeds are not really up yet...All the spots I fished last year at this time were not ready yet...Impossible to find a good weed edge....we fished for 4 hours with only a few jumbos and crappy hooked...Talked to some other boats and locals and they siad the same thing( the weeds arent up yet and in a few weeks it will be good)....I hope this warm weather sticks around so next weekend is better.....   After 4 hours of peppering jigs I managed to hook this beauty 26""... 5lb 11 ounce walleye   After that My buddy got one 1 and a half lber and that was it.   Was wondering how everyone else has been doing so far this year in the Kawarthas? I might Hit Gbay next weekend for pike until the weeds are up in the kawarthas  Goodluck on the water"
207158,Stoty,2008-05-27 19:28:00,2910,"Nice fish!  I have done pretty well for eyes on Stoney so far. Hitting Stoney up again in the morning, to see if I can keep the streak alive!  Snap jigging in the weeds seems to be the trick."
207160,snagmaster,2008-05-27 19:31:00,250,Got to try stoney...have never fished it...I fish the north western kawartha lakes mostly......thanks stoty
207163,Stoty,2008-05-27 19:37:00,2910,"No worries. Before you head to Stoney let me know, and I will hook you up with some maps/spots."
207165,Reef Runner,2008-05-27 19:43:00,981,"I fish the North-Westerly Kawarthas regularily.  Only went once this year so far, with no eyes to show for it.  Was dropping GULP leaches in pockets and edges, to be outdone by OOS largies.  Trollng jointed rapalas above the weeds, to be outdone by Crappy.  The water is still cold and levels are down about 6 to 10 inches.  Nice report.  reefrunner"
207169,snagmaster,2008-05-27 19:55:00,250,I will forsure Stoty...thanks again man....same goes for you if you head up the way I fish.    Those GULP leaches are sweet...I catch most of my fish on grubs.....Last year at this time the fishing was hot already...Guess its PIKE time!! They fight better anyway...lol and to be honest almost taste the same if your looking for a shorelunch in my opinion
207175,johnnyb,2008-05-27 20:02:00,3413,"Water up in Muskoka is the same thing...cold, no weeds...few walleye...At least you got one nice one!"
207200,Victor,2008-05-27 21:35:00,1609,nice fish!  Great job for keeping the shirt on despite the real nice looking weather
207246,mbac31,2008-05-27 22:21:00,904,Very tough. I managed to get a few  on Thursday in the Kawarthas. Worked hard for them.  No weeds yet. Walleye were in very shallow water. Got most of them in 4 ft or less. Roaming looking for food.
207249,Sinker,2008-05-27 22:26:00,8692,"Fish the shallow flats near river mouths. The first weeds will be shallow, and the fish are still using the current. We're still a couple weeks behind right now......this is how it should be for opener. Shallow running cranks over any weeds you can find should get you some fish.  Nice fish you got there though.....What kind of structure did you find her in?  Sinker"
207298,Big Cliff,2008-05-27 23:29:00,6899,"Sinker is right on the money, think shallow, cranks or jigs tipped with a minnow, silver meps, #2 or 3, I like to tip mine with 2 white twister tails but the key is shallower than normal for this time of the year. There is some weed growth just starting to form and if you can find that, you will find walleye. My best results have been in 3-4' of water so far with a few fish coming from a little deaper."
207436,kingofthesteelhead,2008-05-28 02:24:00,140,"Sorry to contradict some of you guys,but could not find anything shallow at Stoney on Sunday,but 5 half decent walleye in 51 feet of water vertical jigging with a 3 inch yellow tail tipped with a a worm. Steve alias crappieperchunter you know where we were if you are reading this!"
207447,Sinker,2008-05-28 02:37:00,8692," I don't doubt that. I caught mine on opener out of 42FOW. Honestly, I haven't fished the kawartha's since......I'm just going by what usually works in years passed.  Sinker"
207522,Big Cliff,2008-05-28 10:28:00,6899,"You can contradict all you want,   I don't fish Stoney but I do fish Sturgeon lake and so far all the walleye I have caught this year have come from shallow water, mind you, I haven't tried deeper water. I haven't really kept track but I think I am averaging about two walleye per hour of fishing so far this year but I haven't fished for about a week now so things might have changed, I do know that the water level has dropped about 6"" below normal, that may change things a bit too."
207705,snagmaster,2008-05-28 20:12:00,250,Thanks for the tips guys. I got that fish in 6 FOW in a coontail weedflat.....Most of the day I fished between 5 and 12 FOW...Maybe I should of went a little shallower.....Might give it another shot this weekend
207746,ozaibak1,2008-05-28 22:06:00,401,"Yep was fishin Stoney last Saturday and sighted two walleyes in very shallow water about 4 feet, and had a hell of a time trying to find weed growth."
207752,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-28 22:18:00,0,Nice pickeral.I've been finding pickeral on fresh green weed growth on bottom in 4-8 FOW(depending on sunlight). And dragging my jig over it and snapping it free or lifting it when caught up and this triggers the hits. Good luck on the pike!
207878,HTHM,2008-05-29 02:11:00,4082,Nice catch! I hope to be able to do the same on sat. I have a real hankerin' for a fish dinner.
