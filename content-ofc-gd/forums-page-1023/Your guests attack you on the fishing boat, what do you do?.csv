207974,Fish Farmer,2008-05-29 11:39:00,2234,"If they own the river, why would they ask you to take them for a ride. I don't think anyone can own a river. One of the guys is your neighbor   Was this a hit your neighbor planned. Something still missing in this story, as everyone thinks. It sure sounds that you ticked someone off.  . Everyone having a good time and the last minute a murder. Sounds like a movie I watched ( Deliverance ) Squeal like a pig."
207975,Sinker,2008-05-29 11:39:00,8692,"I think I""ve finally heard it all now.  Thanks Burgerdude!  Sinker"
207983,jonnybass,2008-05-29 11:57:00,346," I asked you if they were paying you because like everyone else in this thread, I'm trying to understand your story. If you really wanted advice, you should have explained the story better from the get-go. You keep adding bits and pieces to the story, but it still doesn't add up. That's why you're getting flamed. People are assuming that you caused it.  My advice to you is that you start from the beginning and write the story again, this time with every little detail of what happened from beginning to end. Then read your story, see if it makes any sense, fill in the missing pieces and then and only then ask for advice.  (Otherwise it appears to everyone that you're hiding something)"
207984,Roy,2008-05-29 11:58:00,13728,"Burgerdude, you're a troller. Both on the net and on the water. The only part of your story which might sound kind of plausible is that you may or may not own a boat. This is a waste of bandwidth."
207876,BFSC Kevin,2008-05-29 02:09:00,1351,  LOL glen!
207879,Moosebunk,2008-05-29 02:22:00,3970,I can probably think of 3 people I'm likely better off never knowing.
207882,JerseyDog,2008-05-29 02:26:00,190,What I find a little funny is you asked what you should do if this happens again.  I think once in a lifetime is strange enough.
207888,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 02:35:00,15," I can only hope it happened once in a lifetime, I just would like to know what your rights are as a captain and or individual in this type of situation.  I would recommend calling the police.... if it ever happened again.  I am still getting reprecussions from the incident though and the attacker actually asked me to fight him. I told him I had no reason to fight him. I don't think he really understands that he was in the wrong at all. I also cannot identify the person other than his first name if it even is his first name. No idea where he lives other than the general area. It just happened to be a coinsidence that I ran itno him last weekend. I did not drive up with my tow vehicle or I might have been in a similar situation."
207889,brickNblock,2008-05-29 02:39:00,598,"No Offence Gerrit... But like you, there are times where I'd welcome the chance to put YOUR size 13 boots to work but in this case..... I think I'd really put this to rest and rather sense that something doesnt really ad up here at all. Believe me Gerritt...Ive seen a mite more then you Bud..however my first reaction would be something like your'N Burger guy.......something you aint telling us bud????? If your straight up...... You best start choosing your passengers a lil better to be sure....or the company you keep. Sounds like everyone was on serious drugs to me....... If not.. Then a medical situation at least....WOW..that was insane Everyone is supposed to be grown past them stages."
207890,Greencoachdog,2008-05-29 02:40:00,8163,  You can either shoot him now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHAFx2uVdKc...feature=related  Or find another body of water to fish.

207896,holdfast,2008-05-29 02:55:00,1813,"Was one of them Female.  Were they both male?  Something wierd about your story.  Did you not pick up any vibes during any conversations.  Im with Gerrit, if not now, then later for payback.  As far as Cops are concerned, your word against theirs.  Next time someone grabs your neck for nothing.  THROAT PUNCH HIM just kidding call the cops."
207898,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 03:01:00,15," Everyone aboard is male. I do understand that it would be my word against theirs. I did not pick up any vibes during the conversation until the last 20 feet of the trip, The river had pushed the boat slightly downstream from the dock and struggling to get it back up stream seemed to start the uproar. The electric trolling motor was a 36 volt minn-kota terrova and had been running for quite a while, apparently the current was a bit stronger near the dock then it had been all the way down the river."
207903,Greencoachdog,2008-05-29 03:19:00,8163,Does this give you any ideas? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T09XWRkq5M
207910,Tinman,2008-05-29 03:23:00,376,"one word, TAZER"
207912,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 03:29:00,15,"Pretty funny you post that particular Youtube flick, You may have apoint though. I do have a much better fishing rig than either of these two could ever dream of owning. It could have been extreme jealousy on their part. Could it have been that my electric trolling motor with auto pilot and co-pilot actually got these two angry enough to consider physical violence?  Would you advise I just return to my old motorguide trolling motor that hafd a big click when it runs and only had high speed?  Obviously there is some truth in the humor you presented or you would not have presented it.  Thank you for considering that angle."
207914,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 03:30:00,15, I think a well placed tazer or cow prod might have worked well. I will consider that.
207915,danbo,2008-05-29 03:30:00,2646,I'd challenge them to a Badminton tournament! Against these guys..  
207933,OhioFisherman,2008-05-29 05:24:00,6623,"I would expect proper behavior from a guest, client, ect., including a fishing buddy, hands on me means walk the plank dude. Yelling, screaming at me? you don`t know your place dude, but this ain`t it!.  A numbers question for police, 2 dudes telling one story, you with another, unless you have evidence?"
207936,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 06:11:00,15,"In response to Greencoachdog, I thought I would add a video of my own. They call it the Buddy Plan, and it sounds good to me.    Have fun with that one"
207937,danbo,2008-05-29 06:43:00,2646,You try Ann Landers?
207953,Chris,2008-05-29 10:44:00,405,Introduce them to the back of your hand. That's what I do and this kind of thing happens to me every week.
207954,love2fishhave2work,2008-05-29 10:47:00,212,"So let me get this straight.  You picked up some guy who ""owns the river"" for a joy ride and that ride seemed to go bad.  I guess that happens when one cruises for strangers in the woods.  After reviewing a number of your posts, I am not surprised they did not throw you out of the boat, throw you a rope and tow you to shore.   Had to be said.  Now I am going fishing for 4 days and will try to avoid drunk captains who pick up strange men and offer them boat rides for kicks."
207958,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 11:11:00,15," Nice try! I was not drinking, one of the guests was a neighbor. They did not seem drunk when they left the dock. Thank you for making itr evident that you practice ""Flaming"" new members  Read the posts again you missed several points. Thank you for your comments  Happy fishing and good luck!"
207963,Billy Bob,2008-05-29 11:22:00,5865,This post is a GOOD reason we need a non fishing sections
207964,lew,2008-05-29 11:23:00,12767,"I'm afraid I have to admit to being a bit confused .......  You take a couple guys out for a boat ride somewhere and for no apparent reason the beat you up, so rather than going straight to the police to file a complaint, you join a fishing website and tell your tale to a bunch of total strangers"
207966,jonnybass,2008-05-29 11:28:00,346,"They were paying you, correct?"
207970,Whopper,2008-05-29 11:33:00,2174, Exactly  Something doesn't add up here.  Lew how many hours do you think youv'e logged behind the helm? ever had anyone choke ya
207972,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 11:36:00,15," No I was not being paid in any way shape or form, I had pulled up to the nearest adjacent property to where i store the boat. The dock owners are very good friends of mine and I am very welcome to use the dock. The neighbor that asked for the ride lives more inland and up the road. I was asked if I would take them up stream a bit.  I am asking the opinion of other boaters here. The general discussion area.  I am not asking for ""flaming"" at all. Please stop doing so. Johnnybass the flaming statement was not directed towards you.  Good question though."
207811,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 01:11:00,15,"Hello, I need to express my story and ask for your opinion as to what you would do in these circumstances. I had the unfortunate experience of being choked over the gunwale of my fishing boat after a 3 hour tour. I was wondering about maritime or inland water laws pertaining to abusing the captain physically. I really had not caused any type of attack nor was it warranted. I simply took the guests for a ride on my fishing boat. The boat was executing a good rate of speed heading up river, but to save fuel I used the trolling motor to glide us back downstream on the return trip. Upon return to the original dock one of the guests began screaming. Get me to shore NOW!!!, I did the best I could to accomodate the guest and knowing the water was too shallow for the big motor I used the electric and gas trolling motor to get the boat to the dock. I asked the screaming guest to calm down and once the boat was docked the other passenger jumped over the screaming guest and choked me over the gunwale. I waited for them to get off the boat and then let the boat drift offshore a bit before regaining my composure. Two against one in the middle of a dark river was an equation that made me think it was a life or death situation which I did not want to see the equality of. Ever since then I have been told that I was not well liked by both of these guests. I really do not understand this, They did all the bad behavior, I did not cause any of the conflict, I even went so far as not causing conflict by remaining passive during the attack. This weekend I was approached by the guy who choked me, while I was on shore. I was informed that he had been on the river since age zero and I quote, ""He ran the river"". I really cannot understand how what he said about running the river is suppose to affect my use of the river or nearby inland waters. My question is how would you handle this situation within reason?"
207812,Weeds,2008-05-29 01:14:00,782,Police?
207815,silveradosheriff,2008-05-29 01:17:00,1025,Interesting intro....
207816,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 01:18:00,15,"Police would have been a good solution, however, being it was dark and I needed to get my boat out of the water I drove back to the launch and trailered my boat back to storage. The event happened last year sometime, mid to late season. I had forgotten the date exactly. I really need to know how I deal with this in the future. Do I report this now? or is it too late?"
207817,2 tone z71,2008-05-29 01:18:00,1311,"HAHAHAHAH nice first post ,ill keep my negative ,hick ,bad boy ,red neck comments to myself on this one ,ill let the more growed up mature members handle this"
207820,Rizzo,2008-05-29 01:23:00,4754,"I would suggest padded gunwales, will be much gentler on the neck should these cretins get fresh with you again"
207821,huntervasili,2008-05-29 01:23:00,1604,"You can use whatever ""reasonable means"" necessary to keep you're self safe. If hes choking you you can push him off or sock him one or until the threat is gone. when hes crying on the ground is when you cant hit him anymore and call the cops to get him charged... If he attempts to charge you you can claim self defense but ensure you don't go overboard and kick the crap out of him"
207824,danbo,2008-05-29 01:24:00,2646,Try Karate lessons..
207825,live2fish,2008-05-29 01:25:00,70,if a guy attacks me on my boat without me doing anything to deserve it hes not going to be getting to shore by boat maybe a life jacket or a floating ring. Unless he could over power you in that case you have to let them handle the situation and hope it doesnt end badly. Police would have been good but i dont understand what would provoke this outburst and why was he on your boat in teh first place just for a cruise? did he seem nice before you took them out and did u do somethign to scare or upset the passengers.  lots of blanks.  Bowen
207835,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 01:32:00,15,"The only way I can see they got upset is when I told them they could not drive the boat. I paid good money for the boat, repairs and insurance and if anything happened on or to the boat I wanted to be sure it was me who caused the damage and it would not end in an ""Oh I am sorry"" where I would have to pick up the bill anyway."
207839,huntervasili,2008-05-29 01:36:00,1604,ohh and there's always the flaregun
207843,Blue_Axela,2008-05-29 01:38:00,88,Wow...messed up story.  So many missing pieces to it tho.
207844,huntervasili,2008-05-29 01:39:00,1604," Thats how it seems, unless this guy was on some sort of drugs or forgot to take them that morning"
207852,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 01:43:00,15,"I can mention it really has changed my experience as a boater. The lack of respect by those guests in particular seems to have changed my attitude in general toward inviting any other people on the boat. I know now that if a person has been drinking or seems intoxicated in any way they are not getting on my boat, no way, no how."
207853,Terry,2008-05-29 01:44:00,14456,"well, guest please define? friend, paying customer,  someone off the street, were they drinking if I needed to get to shore NOW, I would not stop and fight the only guy who can get me to shore NOW.....   anyway there is not enough info to give you an opinion, that would mean anything.......I would call the police under most circumstances.....  there are 3 sides to every story yours his and the truth"
207856,huntervasili,2008-05-29 01:44:00,1604, You answered you're own question... don't let drunk strangers on you're boat and you won't have this problem
207857,Burtess,2008-05-29 01:45:00,901,"I agree, too many holes in the story....  Did they ask you for a ride in your boat or did you ask them?  Did they hire you? Did you have a nice conversation on the way up river? How did you know these guys before the ride? Age of you and the other guys? Alcohol or drugs involved?  Give us more details...  Burt  Edit:  Wow, flury of posts in last 5 min, some of those questions have now been asked or answered..."
207860,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 01:50:00,15," They asked for the ride, The conversation was great all the way up and all the way down until the last 20 feet to the dock. I knew one guy as a neighbor and I did not know the attacker at all. I am 44 yrs old, the screamer is 54 yrs old and the attacker was 38 yrs old. I was not drinking, the other two seemed to have been drinking."
207862,Gerritt,2008-05-29 01:52:00,6129,There is NO way I would have sat there and let someone put there hands around my neck first off.. and I have no issue in saying that once they were laying in their own blood I would have zero issue in smashing every single one of their teeth out with my size 13's.. down or not...  that is if they made it off the boat..

207865,huntervasili,2008-05-29 01:55:00,1604," I wouldn't have a problem with it either, its the courts who do..."

207868,HTHM,2008-05-29 01:59:00,4082,"It is not too late to press charges, and I suggest you do, provided the facts are as you have stated."
207869,Markus,2008-05-29 02:00:00,25,Did you attempt to put your hands around anything of his prior to them demanding to get to shore?
207871,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 02:05:00,15," Absolutely not, I did not touch either of these passengers. I did the best I could within reason to get them to shore asap. As I said I found it was too shalow for my Big motor and actually dinged the prop on the rocks trying to expedite the trip to shore, after the Ding, I lowered the kicker and ran the electric motor as a bow steer to get us back to shore."
207874,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 02:07:00,15,"I do appreciate all these replies I am suprized to see that so many actually watch these posts so closely. I do appreciate all the help.  How do I adress the fact that those two think they ""RUN"" the river?"
