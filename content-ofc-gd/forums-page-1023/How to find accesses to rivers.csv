The ones I know are from people on the board or friends met on rivers .. but sometimes I want to have a little adventure ..  This is what I have tried. - Look at maps to see where the river goes - Drive to closest spot where I might be able to park and realize those are all private properties .. which is not marked on the map ...  For example, I wanna try Whitesville on Duffins Creek ... but still couldnt figure out how to get down there  Thanks!"
207685,Marko,2008-05-28 18:48:00,854,Try google earth. Find a river that you want to fish and you should be able to zoom in enough to see trails and paths that go along the river.

I did this on the Grand River once and the people kindly let me fish what looked like a great stretch of river that I could only get to off their property.  I also made sure to show 'em the bag I had tucked into my fishing vest and let them know that I would pick up any garbage I found along the river bank.  I really think stuff like that fosters good will and shows you will respect their property."

Approach them nicely offer to bring out any garbage you find, and for me I always stress that I practice catch and release. I have an anglers card(kinda like a business card) that I got made up years ago. Im sure it would be even easier now with a computer and a printer to do it yourself. On the card are my name, my phone number, my address, the conservation groups I am a member of, and my fishing practices and beliefs. I respectfully approach the property long before I go to fish it, dress conservatively and explain my purpose for being there. If the owner is willing I make an appointment to come and fish the property that is suitable for him. If he is unwilling I thank him for his time and move on. I have cultivated access to many stretches of private water this way. Again I stress dont show up in your waders, pole in hand. A lot of these owners cant stand fisherman on their property because of past poaching/tresspassing incidents. The forethought and care of my approach seems to ease their fears of yahoo's being on their property."
