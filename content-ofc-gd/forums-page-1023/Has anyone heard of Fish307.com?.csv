Has anyone ever heard of this site or purchased from it? Do the price is $40 cheaper then anywhere else thats why I am concerned. I have never seen it for this low, its usually $180 across the board or more expensive. Anyone have any experience with them?  Thanks,  Mike"

205719,limeyangler,2008-05-24 17:29:00,5204,"Hey Mike,  I've never bought anything from them but i have definitely heard of them. In fact they are the sponsors of an ice fishing forum i use , and the guys on there use it. In fact they also give out gift vouchers from that company as tourney prizes and i have never seen any complaints about them on the forum."
205723,Fang,2008-05-24 17:38:00,1330,Mike  I've order parts for my downriggers through these guys sevral time. I found shipping was a tad high but prices and hard to find stuff made up for those charges. Everytime I need a part I usually pick up a lure or 2 just to make shipping $ better deal  Anyone with downriggers should check this site out. They have a great parts page and have the schematics for easy reference.  Stuff is at my door within the week.
