207807,workwear,2008-05-29 01:03:00,592,hiya everyone.......was wondering if someone can shed some light on this my trailer has a 5 prong attachment......my buddy wants to tow it on friday...but he has only a hard wired 4 prong went to canadian tire this aft and they looked at us like weve been smokin something illegal.....has anyone ever heard of a converter for a 4 prong from his truck  to a 5 prong to my trailer......im assuming the extra prong is for the surge brakes  any help would be greatly appreciated ......
207813,Fisherman,2008-05-29 01:14:00,7201,"Nope, can't say I've ever seen a 4 to 5 adapter in either direction.  If your trailer had surge brakes, then I'm pretty sure it does not need electricity, it's activated by deceleration, if it is electric brakes, then your vehicle will have an electric brake controller.  Your vehicle plug, White=ground, Brown=running/park lights, Green=right, Yellow=left, what is the other wire?  What are the wire colours on your trailer?"
207850,workwear,2008-05-29 01:43:00,592,colours on the trailer prongs black green yellow white brown.....  trailer has surge brakes....  thxs peter
207859,Terry,2008-05-29 01:49:00,14456,"well the newer trailers with surge brakes use the white wire to kill the brakes while backing up and if they are disc brakes you need that  but there is no reason why you can't buy  a 5 wire vehicle plug and the 4 wire trailer plug and just wire them together and you have an adapter  you could run the wire wire to the back up lights, if the white wire is for the brakes and it will work I don't think you meant electric brake so it will work"
207872,Fisherman,2008-05-29 02:05:00,7201,Terry...are you sure about the white wire?  White is always or just about always ground(12V-)
207906,Sinker,2008-05-29 03:20:00,8692,"If your trailer has surge brakes with a 5 prong plug, you can just plug into the 4 way on the vehicle, and leave the last hole empty. The 5th wire is for electric brakes.  Sinker"
207945,Terry,2008-05-29 09:28:00,14456,yeah you might be right about the white...my bad
