208238,GBW,2008-05-29 20:58:00,8460,Hey all.  So I have a 8HP Honda that is about 6 years old (or less) and has a High Output Charging option. Info from Honda: The BF8 provides 2 Amps at 1000 RPM and an amazing 12 amps at only 3000 RPM to maintain the battery charge or keep electronics going even at trolling speeds.  Is this option worth the money to charge my batt. to power my sonar and minn kota?  has anyone used one?  Thanks...  Geoff
