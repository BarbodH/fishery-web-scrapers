207029,theRJ,2008-05-27 15:09:00,55,Does anyone know of a reliable shop to find 1/2oz titanium spinnerbaits? I live in Mississauga and dont mind a little driving. I found 3/8oz ones at Lebaron a couple years ago.  Every time I go to BPS they are sold out and LeBaron only carries 3/8oz ones.  Any help out there?  RJ  PS I hate the 1/2oz SS ones because I have had pike and bass strike them and put them out of true without being hooked.

207053,kentooley,2008-05-27 15:59:00,208,I bought a couple at Lebaron 2 weeks ago. They had both when I was there.
207100,theRJ,2008-05-27 17:25:00,55,I was kind of hoping to get it for this weekend and International orders are generally 7-10 days. I will have to check LeBaron on the way home.  RJ

207553,OhioFisherman,2008-05-28 12:15:00,6623,"The rubber core sinkers work pretty well for adding weight to a spinnerbait, just pull out the rubber core and crimp to the hook."
207653,gone_fishin,2008-05-28 16:46:00,481,"ebay always has good deals on fishing lures - you just have to watch the shipping prices. i just won 2 separate auctions (3 terminator spinnerbaits in each auction - first set of 3 were the titanium series, and the other set was the stainless series). got the whole lot for $18 + $7 shipping... $25 for 6 terminator spinnerbaits... can't beat that! works out to just over $4 a piece!"
207744,misfish,2008-05-28 22:04:00,29133,"I have bought many lures off of E bay. Some good,some crap."
207758,BabyHerc,2008-05-28 22:29:00,285," Amen to that.  Been doing it for years.  Especially good with keeping smaller profile baits down deep for smallies on shield lakes.  Shhhhhh, don't tell anybody..."
