I know they are few and far between in southern ONT, and especially SE ONT.  but I was hoping someone could point me in the direction of a nice stream and or back lake (canoe accessible) where I might be able to hook into a couple.  I live in Kingston and would be looking for something within 1-1.5 hours drive from here.  I don't need specific spots (I like the adventure of searching), maybe just some water body names...  PM's welcome  Thanks in advance -fwf"
208644,Danubian,2008-05-30 16:00:00,65,I just PM'd you.
208647,BillM,2008-05-30 16:11:00,17367,"If anyone would like to PM me regarding Brookies, please feel free  BTW, I'm 100% catch and release (allergic to fish, so no choice)  Not asking for your honey holes, just a general area I can check out.  I haven't caught a brook trout since fishing Algonquin over 15 years ago."
208669,troutologist,2008-05-30 17:17:00,951,Call the district MNR Office and ask for a stocking list....lake names and coordinates. Nice part is most stocked lakes are fairly accessible.
208671,Sinker,2008-05-30 17:32:00,8692,"there are hundreds of Put and  Take stocked brookie lakes, that are easily accessed in Ontario. Get a map, and a stocking list. Do a little research, and go exploring. 9 times out of 10, you won't be dissappointed.  BTW, check your PM's.  Sinker"
