148205,Terry,2008-01-05 17:07:00,14456,most of the time an internal is as good as an external because people don't or can't put the puck in a really good spot but if you have a clear high spot on your boat the external can/will make a difference  looks like a good unit you will need to add maps

148213,Gerritt,2008-01-05 17:56:00,6129,Hopefully I win this auction and have a new sonar.... I figured I might as well see if I can pick it up for less... otherwise I will purchase it for 350.00  G
148214,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-05 18:01:00,0,Some external pucks need power. Not really a big deal.  My old 104c did not require power. Units after that did. Who knows. They change so fast. My 104c was discontinued a year after I bought it. No BUYERS REMORSE HERE.... Looks like a very good deal. Says NEW!
148215,Gerritt,2008-01-05 18:02:00,6129,"GB Fisher, He has 20 of them for sale  alot of OFC'rs could replace their old units for that price!  G"

148229,lew,2008-01-05 19:19:00,12767,"It's only my personal opinion Gerritt, but for big ticket items like your looking at, I've always preferred going to a reputable dealer like Radioworld or something similar and purchasing from them, rather than chancing a sale from some stranger like your considering, who may be in Romania, or maybe the States, or wherever.  You'll know your dealing with folks who have a great reputation for service and will stand behind their product, and if it's busted right outta the box, you'll just return it for another.  You may pay a bit more going my route, but at least you'll know your satisfaction is guaranteed with whatever you buy.  I know alot of folks swear by Ebay deals and maybe I'm just old fashioned, but that's the way I look at things.  Good luck with whatever you decide though, bud."

207901,Burgerdude,2008-05-29 03:17:00,15," The 3D imaging of the bottom works well if you are looking for structure at trolling speed. I have last years 997c SI model, paid huge bucks for it and even more for the platinum maps.  Amazingly the maps only work in the great lakes and Lake of the Woods. I believe it helped my fish spotting in general. The newer 1197c SI has a larger screen but other than that I am not real sure if it has that many more features. Some of the accessories I own are the barometer and Remote sonar green thingie with the antenna for spotting fish where the boat cannot go. The speed and water temp sensor never seemed to have worked properly yet. The cartography on the chart plotter can be off at times but can be adjusted as needed. There is a 3D option for looking at the contour of the lake when trolling. The Hummiongbird has the option of adding up to 6 high end DT/HS cannon downriggers to it and the ability to control the motion of the electric downriggers from the hummingbird. Some day I may buy the downriggers compatible with the system.  I recommend considering the humming bird brand, but I also think the other folks in this forum may know of better brands.  Good luck with your purchase"
208547,corvette1,2008-05-30 12:10:00,1765,hi gerritt  just found this lcx-27c gps/sonar 749.99 marine general free shipping
146680,Greencoachdog,2007-12-31 07:14:00,8163,You may want to give these some consideration: http://humminbird.factoryoutletstore.com/c...4042&chid=1  Lowrance Lowrance Lowrance  I don't see anybody on this board catching more fish with their Lowrance ubits than I do with my Humminbird.  You get a much bigger bang for the buck with 4000 watts with a Humminbird as opposed to the 2400 watt Lowrance for about the same price.  I'm personally lookin' at the 747c
146681,Vanselena,2007-12-31 11:09:00,269,"The difference between colour and b&w is colour shows the strenth of signal using different colours.  If you are fishing in water less then 100 feet then you don't need more then 1000 peak to peak watts using a 200khz unit, if you are fish deeper then 200 feet then you need a unit with greater then 1000 p2p watts and should be using a 50khz unit. You should also consider that too much power in shallow water spooks fish."
146692,mbac31,2007-12-31 12:12:00,904,"http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true  Here is a link to Cabelas. You will have a hard time finding that unit for cheaper. Small and compact, doesnt have the ability to take the navionics cards though. Dual purpose. Spend another $80 here and you will have the best of both worlds for hard and soft water. $80 is for a new longer normal transducer."
146710,SlowPoke,2007-12-31 13:18:00,2984,Shop wisely Gerritt. That $399 price does not include transducer or GPS puck. You can probably get it cheaper locally when you factor in shipping. Great machine though. -Brian
146712,scuro,2007-12-31 13:28:00,386,I saw a new Hummingbird unit that gave you a 3-d impression of the bottom of the lake. It looked interesting. Anyone have one of these units?
146717,Greencoachdog,2007-12-31 13:52:00,8163, Yup! the HBs come with or without the transducer and free shipping in the U.S.
146718,glen,2007-12-31 13:54:00,2641,They have had the 3D ones out for a long time but i aint used them.  Vanselena how do you know the stronger fish finder spooks fish in shallow water???
146748,Pigeontroller,2007-12-31 15:39:00,2793,"  Glen, if you're expecting the fishfinder to catch the fish for you your doing it wrong...Hummingbird is known for its cheap units, not that they don't make  better quality ones...But they make alot of crap too!"
146750,Greencoachdog,2007-12-31 15:45:00,8163," I've been looking for a 10,000 watt model, 2 or 3 slow passes over the Crappie hole and they'll float to the top already microwaved! Just lift the skin off, salt and pepper to taste, and enjoy!!!  Actually, all sonars will spook fish in shallow water. You will do better if you KNOW fish are holding in a certain to turn off all of your electronics and fish the area quietly."
146759,irishfield,2007-12-31 16:05:00,26272, Watch how it's priced Gerritt... add the 3000 GSP puck and 200 skimmer transducer and it's $649
146817,glen,2007-12-31 18:32:00,2641,I would like to see some data on the fish being spooked by the fish finder.
146836,cork soaker,2007-12-31 19:14:00,23,"It really depends what your fishing. If your a kawartha lakes guy, you'll never need more than that $200 lowrance at bps, but its nice to have the bells and wistles.  If it where my 500 I'd get the $200 job and a Lowrance H2OC portable GPS.  Combo is nice, but  I'd rather have em separate.  Especially if you ever fish out of friends boats as well."
146867,irishfield,2007-12-31 20:54:00,26272, Dah.. TICK TICK TICK of the transducer. Loud out of the water...only louder under it.
146880,Sinker,2007-12-31 21:17:00,8692,  I've outfished guys using thier flashers for perch in s hallow water LOTS of times. Those vex's make a racket......and for sure will spook fish if they're in a bad mood!  Sinker
146892,danbo,2007-12-31 21:58:00,2646,
146893,PERCHER,2007-12-31 22:02:00,787,Humminbird all the way.For the price they cant be beat.Humminbird has come along way .I have a 767 and it has 4000 watts of power and gps mapping.For 419.00 at Le baron.Add another 60.00 and you can get the same unit in colour.They also come with the gps puck and a dual beam transducer.To buy the same unit in a Lowrance you would pay almost double the price.So take a look you will be supprised at what you get for your money.Lowarance are no doubt good units but I think dollar for dollar Humminbird is a far better buy. Just my 2 cents. Dan

146981,Vanselena,2008-01-01 02:48:00,269,"Try fishing with a sounder on and then fish with the sounder off, you will notice a huge difference. The higher the watts the more power going to the piezo electric element and the louder the sound. The US military did some tests with this and unfortunately killed some whales. You can also do some research on the net and I am sure you will find tons of info on this. This link should give you a starting point.  http://www.whales.org.au/news/tyack.html"
146983,Corey,2008-01-01 03:05:00,355, Does this mean that greenpeace is gonna start targetting us poor fisherpeoples who use sonar? Think you can design a whale safe fishfinder to protect us from the eco warriors?

148202,Gerritt,2008-01-05 16:56:00,6129,LOL... I just dont feel like buying something only to find out it is not what I thought it would be... but for the link I provided... that units is 600.00+ retail... he has 20 of them for 350.00 including free shipping....   so my question remains...  is an internal antenna as good as an external one?  G
146506,Gerritt,2007-12-30 14:20:00,6129,"Ok Guys... Time for me to bite the bullet and make a purchase.. as the unit I have will NOT cut it next year....  I have what I consider i decent budget budget for this purchase no more then 500.00 or so.. but if I can get a decent unit for alot less then I would be even happier  I have had my eyes on the Lowrance x96 @ BPS for 199.99 is there any drawbacks to this unit? Why is it so inexpensive? And why is the x135 200.00 more? for what seems to me to be minor differences..?  I just want a decent unit that is within my means.. I have no brand loyalty but at the same time dont want to start a brand war here..  Colour is not important to me... unless you can explain to me why is is needed and not just a fashion statement for lack of a better term  thanks in advance guys,  I am willing to purchase from the company that offers the best price but service is also important  Bill's Bait N Tackle has always been fair to me.. even if I have to wait for it to come in... they service they provide makes it worth waiting a couple days..  so I could really use your opinions guys as I need to pull the trigger.  G."
146528,Mike the Pike,2007-12-30 14:58:00,3421,Well Gerritt although I do like Lowrance products I find them a little over priced.  When I purchased my boat in 2004 I made the mistake of buying a unit without a built in GPS.Yes I am happy with my Lowrance X-51 but I should have opted for the GPS.  You should contact Percher you can a pretty nice quality Hummingbird that falls into your budget.A good bang for the buck.  
146529,Roy,2007-12-30 15:06:00,13728,"The big difference 'tween the two units Gerritt is 1,500 vs 4,000 watts. Whatever you get, trust me, go 4,000 watts as a minimum."
146530,trapshooter,2007-12-30 15:30:00,1234,"Spring for a colour and GPS combo unit now and you won't be putting up a similar post in 2 years.  Trust me, both are invaluable and you can only understand why after using such a unit.  Oh yeah... LOWRANCE"
146536,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-30 16:44:00,0,color vs non color is the difference between night and day.
146538,Mark Kulik,2007-12-30 16:47:00,348,"Couldn't of said it better, Gerrit, Lowrance all the way! the colour is much easier to see regardless of light conditions, the color also helps you interpret the soundings more accuratly, like Roy said the power is the reason for the price diff, sometimes the resolution-pixel count also is considered in price, as for Gps, is it necassary, ?Depends what you want out of it-I wouldn't want to get out without GPS, I have the 2 Lowrance 520 on my rig, as far as fishfinding is concerned -Lowrance is the best -period-and Ive used others! Also service is here in Mississauga.  Mark"
146539,Bob Devine,2007-12-30 17:04:00,251,I second what Mark Kulik said. Lowrance for sure and colour is great for interpreting and you will want GPS too. I have owned all the other brands and Lowrance's fish finding is unmatched. Good luck with your shopping!
146540,Mike the Pike,2007-12-30 17:25:00,3421,Well here we go alot of recommondations for a very expensive colored Lowrance which yes I agree Lowrance is the way to go.  BUT Lets not forget Gerritt has a budget for $500 so what can he get that would be decent in that price range?
146541,Gerritt,2007-12-30 17:29:00,6129,I have found the 520 for 369.00 USD.... and Vatordude is in Michigan so I could have it shipped there... seems like a decent price...  The Hunt continues...  G

146546,glen,2007-12-30 18:15:00,2641,Pardon me but.  How many more  fish is an expensive fish finder going to find compared to a cheap one???
146547,irishfield,2007-12-30 18:20:00,26272,Didn't help us did it Glen! LOL
146555,Pigeontroller,2007-12-30 19:12:00,2793,"I would pick that 520 up for that price! And yes, colour is better for the above stated reasons! Not just as a fashion statement."
146556,Mark Kulik,2007-12-30 19:14:00,348,"Again it depends on what you are doing Glen, if your a begginner or not really fishing structure, or just simply fish every second weekend, it may not be for you, but you would be surprised how much more you see with a high quality unit!"
146557,Sinker,2007-12-30 19:33:00,8692,"I've got an X96 that I bought in the spring. Its a good unit for the price. If there are fish, it marks them. I bought it because I had an old eagle portable unit, and this one fits right into it.....so now I use it icefishing as well as on the boat. Works great on the ice too.....an improvement for sure.  I have no complaints whatsoever with it. You can't find a better unit for the price IMO.....in that power range, with the same pixel count. It marks  bottom at WOT in my boat (30mph).....Good size screen......I like it, and it does what I need it to do.  I'm with the guys who say its not the fishfinder that catches the fish. If you can locate structure, and know how to catch fish, its all you need. Spend the rest of your budget on tackle.  Sinker"
146558,Fisherman,2007-12-30 19:35:00,7201,"I do think there is a bit of difference between basic and high end units, one of them being quality. My old Lowrance X-40, about 20 years old now is still ticking, meanwhile I've seen the Humminbuzzard recycle pile getting bigger."
146562,Bernie,2007-12-30 19:49:00,3190,"Gerritt, if you make a decision on what you would like let me know and I will find out what $ for you. For what its worth, Lowrance seems to be the top choice by most, including me. I will be looking at getting one in the spring with colour and GPS capability."
146564,Spiel,2007-12-30 19:58:00,9065,"....If money is limited (as it always is) I think I'd forgo colour in favour of the highest quality sonar you can afford. Colour will cost you more than the equivalent non-colour. You know I have 2 Lowrance x-135's and they are pretty sweet. Got one of them for a song and dance, if you want to call me I'll explain how and where.  I also prefer to keep my GPS unit seperate for a number of reasons."
146576,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-30 21:16:00,0,Could always WAIT!!! Save and get the color model........  Hey now...what an idea???!!! lol I know a few who have bought the back and white.  It is not easy to see what is water and what is land when it is bright outside. Specially if the lake is NEW to you and you dont know your way around. Big difference. Check them out!!. There's no comparison.
146585,Mark Kulik,2007-12-30 22:11:00,348,"True GB, if i never used color, I wouldn't know what I'm missing, Its just so much easier on the eyes!, I even have my Lowrance ice fishing machine in color, great viewing in a dark clam!"
146587,Bernie,2007-12-30 22:22:00,3190,On second thought maybe if you wait till next year there will be an on-line model so you can give updates to us all as you catch em' .
146590,AzuluSpookd,2007-12-30 22:58:00,348,"I love Lowrance products...I have the X67 and the iFinder H20...however....when I wanted to upgrade this summer to a GPS/Sonar...I did a lot of research and I opted for the Humminbird 797c2. This unit is better than I could have imagined....no changing card files if you go into a different area...no need for a different power source for the external antenna and the ultimate feature is the Birds Eye view. This is amazing. I love it. If you can see the demo of that view online, check it out. Plus...buying it on Ebay saved me 300.00"
