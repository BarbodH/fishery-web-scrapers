Obviously, I will have to hand-craft it.....any suggestions?  Thanks,  Meely  DAILY THOUGHT: SOME PEOPLE ARE LIKE SLINKIES - NOT REALLY GOOD FOR ANYTHING BUT THEY BRING A SMILE TO YOUR FACE WHEN PUSHED DOWN THE STAIRS."

208146,ccmtcanada,2008-05-29 17:06:00,7971," Just add to Zamboni's post...colour of boat as well.  Also, ask if the buyer would want the boat and motor priced separately on the receipt."
