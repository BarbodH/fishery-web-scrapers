208351,mikeh,2008-05-30 01:19:00,824,I think you can launch at the town launch at the south west area of Kempenfelt bay.
208359,Scott S,2008-05-30 01:31:00,203,The end of Tiffin St is a public boat launch and it's free. Scooter
208460,Cudz,2008-05-30 03:48:00,2652,If you use the launch by the marina and you are confident they won't make you pay.  Barrie residents don't pay.  Otherwise use tiffin launch athe the south west corner.  It is good as well but not as good as the main launch.  If you get there before 8 am you can launch at the marina launch for free anyway.
