Saw sledded with his woman Jen out for a stroll tonight also.....It was funny actually cuz he was trying to tell the perch queen how to fish i handed him my rod and not so much as a nibble all the time he was stood they're with my rod....LOL.....  I pulled in a right dandy perch tonight I'm guessing 13"" if not its bloody close cuz this perch was a pig.  The winds were brutal of course lots of people fishing  shoulder to shoulder which drives me bonkers. ;D  But in all a good evening and 23 nice sized perch for when my mom & Lil sis fly in from the UK on Monday. Thats all i have been hearing from my mom of late ."" you had best have some perch when i get there"".......SHEESHHH!..LOL  So here is a pic of my piggy perch.   I never realized how much sun i have caught till i saw this picture.  Now would you not say that was a pretty big perch?  Of course i cannot forget a picture of moi kissing my perch. ;D   and here is our catch.   ;D"
