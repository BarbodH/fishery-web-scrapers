208553,Rich,2008-05-30 12:15:00,3927,"When I see hordes of coontail as far as the eye can see and then a really distinct drop in the weeds (not a transition, simply a drop in depth), well I know I'm in for just about anything that swims. The secondary weedlines that nobody seems to fish. That's where my confidence bursts."
208676,Musky or Specks,2008-05-30 17:40:00,2710,For Largemouth give me superthick surface slop in two -three feet of water with old trees breaking up the pads here and there. I want it so thick that the average Joe angler takes one look and says anyone would be crazy to fish in there. Call me crazy Ill go in and cover it quick with a jawbreaker spoon with some pork on it. After that Ill slow it right down and pitch a jig and pig to all the logs.
207931,jwl,2008-05-29 04:57:00,1056,"I see some great choices...tough one to answer really..I guess it depends on alot of factors for me..species targeted,time of year, water temps, available structure, forage base.  I like fishing any big transition point in an area, but again the above factors come into play as well.  For example if I am fishing winter steelies on the Niagara, in the boat I am fishing current breaks and looking to find the fish in about 15 fow for the most part in areas adjacent to about 25 fow..if I am fishing the banks I look for back eddy areas that the fish will rest and feed in with a decent drop off to deeper water."

208086,Musky or Specks,2008-05-29 14:59:00,2710,I know for me just writing down the description of the spots brings back excellent memeroies of successes and gets me pumped to go fishing.  For stream fishing brown trout give me a pinch down where the stream goes to a third of its width in a riffle and then take a hard turn scouring out the bank and creating a pool thats deepest next to the bank. Add in a big logjam that sits on the bank as well and I KNOW that holds a brown. I'll stand above the riffle in the push and cast a wooley bugger or Bow River Bugger down into the turn and hold it and pump it in the current until senior brown gets ticked off enough to hit it.
208127,setomonkey,2008-05-29 16:39:00,872,"Great thread guys, I'm learning a lot just reading previous posts, esp. from guys with way more experience than me fishing for muskie or trout.  My fave spot on spot has to be a rocky point with deep water on one side and sandy, weedy shallower water on the other. Hold off it with the trolling motor, cover it with a fast lure like a spinnerbait or crankbait, then fish it more slowly and carefully with a jig.  Had some great times on these kinds of spots...  Mike"
