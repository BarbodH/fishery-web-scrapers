207810,walleyemaster,2008-05-29 01:09:00,325,i was just thinking about my favorite lure..it was a cc shad from cotton cordell..it was blue on the back silver and pink on the bottom...and it had a black dot on its tail...this lure caught me every species of fish...i dont have it anymore..i have many cc shads..with a blue back but siver and orange on the bottom....not siver and pink...they dont work as good.. and i have not been able to get that color again..i have searched the world over...i dont know why it worked so well..but that lure was the best..my best fishing buddy stole it out of my box and he got it snagged on a rock shoal and it was gone forever...

208091,CLofchik,2008-05-29 15:20:00,854,"  Original 6"" Cordell Redfin, in copper.  Has a looser wobble instead of Rapala's tight wiggle.  Made out of hollow plastic, so you can drill or melt a small hole, inject 4-5cc's of water, then seal it up again.  The original X-Rap!  Work it like a topwater, troll it, cast it.  On inland lakes I pretty much only fished for bass & pike, great searching tool for both.  Worked really well pier casting in spring for rainbows, browns & coho's back when Lake O still had a smelt run, the water injection made it cast like a brick."
208100,setomonkey,2008-05-29 15:36:00,872,"The first lure I ever bought was a Rapala floating minnow. Caught lots of fish, and still one of my fave lures.  Mike"
