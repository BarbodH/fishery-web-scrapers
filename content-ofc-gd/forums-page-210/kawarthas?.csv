876347,skdds,2014-10-12 03:39:00,195,"Hi Guys,  Hoping to get the Yak out Monday for a quick day trip...can't go too far from T.O. so was thinking Scugog or Rice lake for whatever has been biting. I have not fished this late in the season before either. Anyone been out there recently? Any suggestions? Happy Thanksgiving!  Thanks,  Skdds"
876353,Paudash,2014-10-12 12:54:00,273,I gave up and put the boat away yesterday
876355,Parnelly,2014-10-12 13:03:00,108,"Was out on Rice yesterday. Spoke to an older gent from Toronto, at the launch. He said it was slow for him yesterday and they only landed 2 pickeral. We spent the afternoon in the chop, and only boated 1. Dress warm."
876361,skdds,2014-10-12 14:27:00,195,This does not sound good...how are water temps? Do these lake turn-over or are they too shallow?  ..Maybe I should head to Barrie for some perch?
876362,Steve,2014-10-12 14:29:00,2075,i've heard rice is fishing very tough right now.  our last trip to seymour was very unproductive.  I was out on Hamilton Harbour yesterday and didn't see much action from myself or any of the other boats....including a few bass boats who were as puzzled as I was.

Do these lake turn-over or are they too shallow?  ..Maybe I should head to Barrie for some perch?    12 degrees on the surface.  Yes Rice does turnover and I believe that has already happened.  A friend of the girlfriends, said he was out on Rice earlier this past week and boated 15 one evening. I also heard they were on fire up at Stoney Lake. Havent been to Stoney myself though."
876380,Weeds,2014-10-12 18:03:00,782,"Fished little  lake here in Peterborough yesterday with a buddy for about 4 hours. One solid bite, musky perhaps, nothing else at all. Spoke to another group of fishermen who'd been out all day and had 2 smallmouth and a handful of perch between them. Lake was looking pretty lifeless."
876420,skdds,2014-10-12 22:55:00,195,"Thanks for the info, may look to barrie instead for the perch bite.."
876432,misfish,2014-10-12 23:52:00,29133,"Thanks for the info, may look to barrie instead for the perch bite..  Thats a tough one as well.  It has slowed down big time with the huge amount of shinner feed that has moved in. 5 hours to keep 7 keepers."
876433,Steve,2014-10-12 23:54:00,2075,friends are stilling hitting perch in good numbers on lake erie....  however ... with a Yak....you might be waiting until next year before you get a day to get out.....
876438,skdds,2014-10-13 00:27:00,195,Guess I'll be going to the supermarket for my fish dinner...
