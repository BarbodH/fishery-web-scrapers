Migratory trout and salmon enter and leave the rivers throughout certain times in their lives. Steelhead often return multiple times to a river to spawn and Pacific Salmon spawn once and then die. Steelhead - Prime times are October 1st to December 1st and the 4th Saturday in April until about May 15th. Some other great fishing can occur from December to the end of May and we've had 30 fish days during January, February and March. Brown Trout - Migratory brown trout over 20lbs can be caught in some of our rivers at certain times. Prime time - October -November Pacific Salmon - Pacific Salmon up to 40lbs enter the rivers in late summer and early fall. Prime time is September and early October. Atlantic Salmon - Atlantic Salmon are not yet legal to fish in the rivers but accidental hook up often occur between September and December. Bass, Pike and Musky - We recommend booking trips for these warm water species in July and august which seam to be the most productive times in the rivers. Late June can also be productive once the season opens up."
