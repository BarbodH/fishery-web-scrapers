Always wondered how many fish I spook with the gas motor though, especially in shallower water? Always curios about what others guys use and open to better ideas or set-ups."
876557,Terry,2014-10-13 22:50:00,14456,I never found using  the electric to increase my catch....  back trolling is ok if you have a tiller  my kicker motor does a fine job at slow trolling  and a drift sock if needed going with big waves
876573,porkpie,2014-10-14 00:35:00,2521,"I troll with bowmount.  I use a copilot from stern where my finder is mounted, but before that just used my foot pedal on the seat beside me.  Much less backsplash in a chop, and almost as much control."
876595,Joeytier,2014-10-14 05:32:00,3990,"I use a small motor and can get 1.0 - 1.3 mph trolling in forward gear, but have not found the gas motor to affect my catch rate in shallow water."
876607,BillM,2014-10-14 11:44:00,17367,I usually put the kicker down and steer with the bowmount.
876628,Beavertail,2014-10-14 14:15:00,331,"Thanks for the feedback guys. This raises another question for me...so if the gas motor doesn't seem to affect the bite in shallower water, what's the point in using side planers for suspended walleye? Are they more skittish in open water? I'm new the walleye/boating scene, excuse my ignorance."
876633,BillM,2014-10-14 14:29:00,17367,With planer boards you've just covering a lot more water.
876666,Terry,2014-10-14 17:43:00,14456,Yup just water covered
876868,Spanky80,2014-10-15 21:06:00,152,"I have a bow-mount Terrova with iPilot, and troll much of the summer with bottom bouncers and harnesses in 10 to 35 feet of water.  Works great."
