876893,ecmilley,2014-10-16 00:40:00,2163,Was owed for a job and was payed with a outboard low hrs cleam engine didnt even have paint scratches on the prop Its. 2001 yamaha 15hp longshaft full electric start and electric trim/tilt . Seems its a bit of an odd ball trying to figure a price on it
876897,Moosebunk,2014-10-16 00:54:00,3970,"If you're happy with the payment, that's what it's worth.  Dunno what that'd have cost."
876901,porkpie,2014-10-16 01:09:00,2521,"Original motor would've been over 3K.  It's only 13 years old, so if in good shape should make a good solid motor for someone.  I sold a 1993 Johnson 15hp with electric start for $900 in mid winter.  I'd watch kijiji for a while, that should give you a feel for it!"
876910,Rodwrap,2014-10-16 02:26:00,130,If it starts easy & runs good....priceless !
876926,spincast,2014-10-16 09:28:00,3279,"probably about 15 - 20% less than in June. Check out a couple of the trolling sites (spoonpullers, LOU etc), should be pretty easy to find something comparable."
876947,bigbuck,2014-10-16 13:32:00,2449,"It would make a nice kicker for someone. How bout a case of beer and a bottle of nice scotch for it???? Seriously though, you should be able to get 1200-1400 bucks for it."
876991,Joeytier,2014-10-16 20:54:00,3990,"Very nice motor.  If it were shortshaft i'd even be interested!  I would say $1500 is fair if it's in great shape, which it seems to be."
877034,FloatnFly,2014-10-17 00:27:00,1640,"was going to say $1500 from what i've seen, i would ask for $2000 but have 1500 as your bottom price, gives some room for negotiating.  everything is worth only what someone is willing to pay for it"
