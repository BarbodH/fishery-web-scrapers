876375,leaf4,2014-10-12 16:27:00,2466,I don't see why? the government actually paves roads with that money instead of burning tires and blockading streets lol

876377,Old Ironmaker,2014-10-12 16:50:00,8243,How is it every time a discussion starts about gas prices the conversation morphs into burning tires and blockades of roads? Off to the rez to fill the truck.

I think I should give up. She looks at a piece of meat in the display case and divides the price by 2, that's what each of our meals will cost??????? If it's 5 bucks each or less she buys it. Oh my lord!! I surrender. I don't know how a young working family with children let alone teens can survive these days. Dave we were born in the right time. Get off the bus on Burlington Street and get a job for 30 years and even get a pension, for how long I'm not sure, but today, furgit aboud it."

876232,Gerritt,2014-10-11 04:37:00,6129,Yup low gas prices are going to hurt us!  http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/topstories/oil-price-at-85-costing-provinces-and-economy-billions-1.2795062  Seems our government could care less. They wAnt the $$$$&  G
876233,Rod Caster,2014-10-11 04:55:00,5784,"Good. A reality check for those that think our economy should rely too heavily on oil and oil movement. There should always be a hedge in place for when things don't go the way you expect them to. Hopefully this remains for a while (without dropping through the floor) and Ontario manufacturing, mining and transportation get a boost.  Watch your stocks and investments (mutual funds and stocks) if this continues. The TSX has been at an all time high and bullish for a while, and a correction would be natural. Time for me to place some of my higher risk investments into volitility shelters. I'll re-invest when things are lower."

876263,northernpike56,2014-10-11 16:10:00,717,"Only 97.9 in Oshweken when I was there, thought it would be lower"
876267,ch312,2014-10-11 16:28:00,1590,"Only 97.9 in Oshweken when I was there, thought it would be lower  I wouldn't pay $.097 per liter for any reserve gas as so many places out there have poor quality gas that makes my ATV and enduro run like crap. On top of that, I have native friends who have filled up at certain stations resulting in two trucks failing to even start and run on the stuff. Both trucks started and ran like tops immediately after being drained and topped up with good gas.   Anyways, this sudden drop in prices has me shaking my head as I am amazed by the number of people who think we're now getting ""cheap"" gas when in fact we're still paying far more than we should be.  Jack prices sky high for a while to get people use to paying the high price and make it seem normal, lower prices to make people think they're getting it really cheap, then jack prices even higher than the initial high price as people will think our current prices are dirt cheap. I guess they need to keep prices in the triple digits to justify spending all that money to update all those signs a few years back...   I'm still commuting on my enduro 35 minutes each way and will continue to do so until the cold is unbearable. $3/day for gas is great"
876268,Lape0019,2014-10-11 16:29:00,647,From what I heard on CBC this all stems from a correction that was long overdue. It doesn't sound like it will last long though so fill up your toys now

876297,Mister G,2014-10-11 23:19:00,1429,But without that tax how much would a doctor visit cost you.

876301,2 tone z71,2014-10-11 23:39:00,1311,All there trying to do is shut down our Pipeline Project..because our spineless quivering bleeding heart government finally had the balls to step and say enough!!! ..by 2018 our gas costs will be stable and reasonable

876318,Old Ironmaker,2014-10-12 00:38:00,8243,"I regularly get our fuel on the rez. Not a problem ever, but, and I repeat but, I have friends there and they tell me which ones to use and which to avoid. If I can buy anything for less as long as it isn't a federal offence and is not morally wrong and the quality is equal I will buy it. From Gas to green beans. Politics be damned.  For anyone that frequents the 6 Nations or New Credit reserves PM me and I will pass that info on.  Jack prices to $1.50 then drop it 25 cents and we are all jumping for joy like the little sheep we are. Up to 10 years or so a liter of gas was always 1 percent of the price of a barrel of oil. How they come up with what the cost of a liter of gas is now is far beyond me. Is there anyone here that could enlighten me somewhat as to how they come up with gas prices today or must one be a forensic accountant to know the formula?"
