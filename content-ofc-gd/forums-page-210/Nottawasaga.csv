876999,Ontario Longbow,2014-10-16 21:44:00,1,Anyone having any luck on the Notty? I've been out twice ( in Wasaga) but no hits. Frank
877024,BillM,2014-10-16 23:43:00,17367,No fish in the Notty.
877027,ketchenany,2014-10-16 23:54:00,3229,Yup. He is right on the money. The poor man hasn't caught a fish there in years.  Just goes to look at the pretty trees at this time of year. Comes back and goes again. When will he ever learn!
877028,steelhunter,2014-10-17 00:02:00,81,Lol lots of fish up stream in the notty Pm me I'll give u some tips
877030,Salmonidstalker,2014-10-17 00:12:00,265,"Youre fishing the wrong area. With warm water, early season steelhead fly through rivers until it gets cold; move upstream."
877032,ketchenany,2014-10-17 00:17:00,3229,"he goes where ""no other man has ever gone before"" May cost you an extra $40.00 if you are not careful. BillM lives with the gods"
877049,BillM,2014-10-17 01:27:00,17367,"he goes where ""no other man has ever gone before"" May cost you an extra $40.00 if you are not careful. BillM lives with the gods  All the fish are in my bathtub."
877055,buckster,2014-10-17 01:55:00,530,Ya wasaga is the wrong area  stay away lol.
877058,BillM,2014-10-17 02:00:00,17367,"Ya wasaga is the wrong area stay away lol.  It's definitely not typical steelhead water and if you don't catch a pod of fish you'll be having a fun day doing nothing, lol."
877059,buckster,2014-10-17 02:08:00,530,It's defiantly not holding water that's for sure.  Not the easiest fish for a novice steelheader.
877079,12footspringbok,2014-10-17 09:11:00,459,Just fire me a pm and I'll let you know where Billm was parked Tuesday and Wednesday afternnoon.....                             Nah just kidding...
877080,misfish,2014-10-17 10:06:00,29133,"Thanks for the morning chuckle fellas.   Where ever Bill is parked,I just go bye. The next spot will be much better.LOL"
