876625,BillM,2014-10-14 13:44:00,17367,People are slobs.  The amount of line/coffee cups/whatever I pick up while steelheading is insane.
876626,AKRISONER,2014-10-14 13:48:00,5558,"Its also ridiculous that the government doesn't allow low risk inmates to go out and pick up trash. I guess keeping them institutionalized and not working does better for them and society.  Take a look at the the ditch the next time you drive down the 401, it looks like a landfill."

Should not be needed at all. Our snack bags and empty water bottles go back in our tackle bags. Funny thing. Here, there are little to none out on the shorelines fishing. Its all from boats throwing their garbage in the river. Then the water drops and current focus it up on shore in certain points/shallows etc. Almost everytime we go out we leave with tackle bags, sometimes fish if we plan a meal, and at least one xl garbage bag. Sad really. And probably 80% of that garbage is beer bottles, whisky bottles and beer cans. Nice and classy"
876637,DanD,2014-10-14 14:57:00,2223,I know this isn't dumping in the woods; but it's bad here in town as well. People see a business's dumpster and they think it's a free for all to put their crap in it or more times then none all around it. I got so fed up with these people leaving all this junk here; I started opening up the garbage bags (gross) and looking for addresses. People that do this cannot be all that smart; because there is almost always an address or a phone number to be found in this garbage. I would call the people and ask when I could deliver a package that was dropped off here accidentally or asked if they'd like to pick it up? More times then none they'd be here within a half hour to collect their package; I loved the look on their face when they saw what the package was. LOL  Dan.
876639,Steelheadphycho,2014-10-14 15:05:00,470,That's brilliant!!!  I'm gonna break out the latex gloves and try that some time!

876748,Rod Caster,2014-10-14 23:58:00,5784,"My little river gets all kinds of tires, worm buckets, styro etc etc wash up on shore after the spring freshet. A lot of it comes from the highway about 4 kms upstream, and the abandoned tire yard that is right off the banks of the river near the highway"
876801,fishindevil,2014-10-15 10:05:00,6254,"just like the kawartha lakes ...go look at any dam or shore fishing spot on the kawartha lakes...just a giant garbage dump....i pick up so much garbage both on the water and boat ramps,its disgusting....."
876837,icceman,2014-10-15 16:44:00,36,Just to put my two cents in.  One of my biggest pet peeves is people flicking cigarette butts in the water.  I always provide my guests on the boat a water bottle half empty to dispose of butts but yet always see them flicking them in the lake.
876859,Steve,2014-10-15 20:12:00,2075,"personally, the biggest, most disgusting example of garbage is the condition of lake near the end of ice fishing season.  the amount of garbage left on the ice by ice fisherman is worse than anything I've ever come across...whether that be shorelines, camp sites, etc."
