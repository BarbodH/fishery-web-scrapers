876656,AdamS,2014-10-14 17:27:00,161,Interesting looking lure. Looks like its got potential. Good luck with the project!
876714,pylon,2014-10-14 21:42:00,68,"Your not really giving your money away rod. If it goes into production you are charged what you ""donate"" But will receive product. Therefore think of it as a pre order   and yes they do work very well"
876719,Locnar,2014-10-14 21:51:00,645,"If I donate, do I get a lure in return?"
