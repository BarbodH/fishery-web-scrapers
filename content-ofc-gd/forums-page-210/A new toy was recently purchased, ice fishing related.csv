"
876587,manitoubass2,2014-10-14 02:47:00,11391,I think you did well!
876593,Joeytier,2014-10-14 04:08:00,3990,"Wow, what is that?  Enticer 410 or VK?  Or is trapper the model name?  Looks like a great sled but dont you already have a bravo?  I'm getting antsy waiting for the snow to fly, still gotta get my safari and fix a couple things on the polaris in the next little while"
876600,misfish,2014-10-14 10:05:00,29133,"Are you getting rid of the Bravo?  BTW,Care to share how the truck got stuck? Did a Dodge have to pull you out?"
876602,Sandbag,2014-10-14 10:27:00,533,Chris  I can already picture your Haliburton back lake winter reports.  That will be a great sled for what we have seen you do in the past.  Enjoy  Cheers Craig
876605,BillM,2014-10-14 11:08:00,17367,I love the redneck handwarmers  :)  Great pick up!!!
876608,chris.brock,2014-10-14 12:03:00,4053,"It's another Bravo long track Joey, Hahaha,  I don't know what I'm going to sell, likely my Phazer  And Bri, the Dodge got stuck in the tractor rut which eventually pulled out the Ford, and the Dodge, equal opportunity"
876610,Beavertail,2014-10-14 12:14:00,331,Looks good to me although I'll admit I don't know much about sleds. I DO KNOW that it beats the hell out of walking and dragging your ice fishing kit onto the ice! Good purchase.
876629,Rod Caster,2014-10-14 14:16:00,5784,You did very well. Harder and harder to get parts for this machines but lots of guys want to keep them around.  I picked up an 89 tundra for $125! Actually runs really good and in good to decent shape. A family purchase

A family purchase  that's a steal Chad!  is it a long track? 3 cottage friends have older tundra LTs and love them, classic bush sleds  post a pic when you get a chance"
876642,solopaddler,2014-10-14 16:04:00,8605,"Awesome, another sled to explore the back lakes in NW QC this winter."
876645,Rod Caster,2014-10-14 16:27:00,5784,"Yep it's an LT, at least I'm pretty sure. I'll get some pics up when I next start her up"
876650,chris.brock,2014-10-14 16:59:00,4053,"Awesome, another sled to explore the back lakes in NW QC this winter.  yeah, lets do it!  now we have a Trapper each, we are unstoppable!"
876676,Joey,2014-10-14 18:08:00,9122,"Sweet, you'll have lots of great ice fishing trips with that.   Good score"
