876574,LeXXington,2014-10-14 00:39:00,1928,"I decided to go to Barbados for a last min trip as the price was right and I have a friend that lives there.  While down there I wanted to do some deep sea fishing for the first time.  I checked out a bunch of the very high priced large fishing charters and was completely dejected.  While down there I asked my friend if he could recommend someone around that does a reasonable fishing charter and the first name that came up was Bluefin Fishing Barbados. Word was Rob is a stand up guy and looks after his guest.  All I can say is best advice ever!!  Captain Rob and first mate Joseph was top notch hosts. They had no problem answering any of my questions. The boat was more than big enough to handle the sea. Rob was both every entertaining and knowledgeable.  Now the fishing. Rob knows the area and where the fish should be. We tried a few place with no luck then he took us to a different spot. The tides changed and wham!!! Bite after bite for the next few hours. We were at the right place at the right time!  We had lost so many fish that would just bite the bait in two but would miss the hook we thought he was just feeding them to entertain us.  Quick change in the bait setup and then it was hook up after hook up.  I ended up catching the fish of a life time!  I did the full day Fishing and it was a good thing as things turned on about mid way through. If you’re going to do this type of fishing I think it’s better to go for the full day rather than wish you had.  Rob also does Sea Turtle tours (swim and feed turtles) etc but that was not my thing I just wanted the fishing and Rob at Bluefin Fishing delivered.  Although Lloyd from U and Me Guide Service, has set the bar on knowledge and service for Ontario.  I think Rob at  http://www.bluefinfishingbarbados.com is a good competition in Barbados.   How they load your gear for you.   You have to walk out to the boat.. When the water is 30C at 6AM and the air is 32C not really an issue    Water temp and depth.. Barbados you hit deep water about 1 mile off shore   My biggest fish. This fish is called a wahoo.    Some more fish     Full Days catch  "

876614,LeXXington,2014-10-14 12:35:00,1928,"After the trip Rob asked us if we want the fish, but we declined it went to the fish market to make extra cash for the Captain. Rob is on the south coast by the ""St Laurence GAP"""
