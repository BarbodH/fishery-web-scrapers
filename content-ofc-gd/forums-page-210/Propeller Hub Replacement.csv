I noticed late this summer that I seemed to have lost a few mph of top speed and occasionally thought my prop was over-revving. When I pulled it off this weekend and checked it, I could see that the rubber hub is badly worn, so it has been slipping. My motor is a 1989 35HP Merc, and other than this is in terrific shape. Any reccomendations on where to get the hub replaced? I live in the Gueplh area and work in the Mississauga / Oakville area."
