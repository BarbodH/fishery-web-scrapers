876261,Roy,2014-10-11 15:53:00,13728,"WOW!!! Mike, that WALL-eye could reach the ceiling, I was floored when I first saw it! Thanks for sharing the pic. I'm a little squeamish  at those sights but this one is ok."
876264,northernpike56,2014-10-11 16:20:00,717,"Ive caught a couple with huge tumors as well...... Why is it that they're like the only fish that gets them, and does that affect consumption?"
876266,MJL,2014-10-11 16:27:00,2427,They're evolving towards having x-ray vision to see anglers' hooks  That's what walleyes of the future will look like
