876782,2 tone z71,2014-10-15 03:26:00,1311,what a beauty..well done congrats
876813,LucG,2014-10-15 12:33:00,779,"Big fish, was that taken with a GoPro or something?  FOV reminds me of my ultra wide angle 10-22mm.  Good eye Bill! Yes it was taken with a GoPro, so you do get a bit of embellishment, but none the less she was real fat and a true trophy. Hope to catch her again someday hahaha  Would have liked to get it on film, but we caught it 5 minutes into our day, hadn't had the chance to setup the camera yet and FISH ON."
876815,LucG,2014-10-15 12:36:00,779,"Holy crap Luc! Hahaha  I caught a big sheepshead one while fishing for walleye in Nip and got excited about it. This is jn a league of its own as ""surprise catch""  Definitely a real surprise catch!  Even though he had it hooked on the end of his line, the pressure was on me to grab the beast, our little bass net was waaaay under sized. lol  Got her on the first grab! haha"
876821,jbailey,2014-10-15 13:03:00,866,wow what a beast! that must have had the adrenaline pumping!!!

I bet you're kicking yourself for not getting measurements   GoPro or not, that's a cow!"
876834,Carp,2014-10-15 16:07:00,1488,SAWEEETTTTT !!!!  Congrats on the beauty fish.
876843,LucG,2014-10-15 17:46:00,779," I bet you're kicking yourself for not getting measurements   GoPro or not, that's a cow!  Meh, not really. I know it wasn't a record by any means, and whether its 48 or 52 dosen't change the fact that it was a great fish."
876862,davey buoy,2014-10-15 20:25:00,5505," Meh, not really. I know it wasn't a record by any means, and whether its 48 or 52 dosen't change the fact that it was a great fish. A true fisherman here ,not trying to get the extra glory.Well done sir !!!!.A beast is a beast."
876888,bigbuck,2014-10-16 00:15:00,2449,At the end of the day that is a supertanker muskie. Must have been interesting trying to get it into the boat. That has got to be a 40lb class fish.
876942,LucG,2014-10-16 12:59:00,779,"A true fisherman here ,not trying to get the extra glory.Well done sir !!!!.A beast is a beast.  Thanks Dave!"
876943,LucG,2014-10-16 13:03:00,779,"At the end of the day that is a supertanker muskie. Must have been interesting trying to get it into the boat. That has got to be a 40lb class fish.  As I mentioned it was caught on bass gear, so she put up a good fight. Several line peeling drags later she tired out a bit and with one quick grab by yours truly she was in the boat. Quick pic, followed by a perfect release."

876660,LucG,2014-10-14 17:35:00,779,"Made it out on Nipissing for one last kick at the can for some late season smallies.  Was tough to find fish, but when you did, it was easy to catch a few out of the school. Weather was cold and windy so slow moving tubes and drop shot presentations were a must.  Even tho no big bass were caught, we did however manage to catch a fish of a lifetime when my partner sets hook on a giant muskie using a spinnerbait.  Gotta love fall fishing!   "

876686,LucG,2014-10-14 19:04:00,779,"Whoa!! You got measurements for that beast?  Unfortunate no measurement. I would put it at roughly 50"" give or take an inch or two. But was she ever FAT!"
