875944,bawbag,2014-10-08 22:53:00,48,Can anyone recommend a place to stay on or near lake st clair? Looking to get a few days of fishing in with some friends. Search of the internet didn't return much.
875949,bow slayer,2014-10-08 23:17:00,1074,"google rooms in Chatham it is your best bet.  The Saxony Motel in Chatham is cheap and very clean. We got a room there last year for 45 bucks for the night with a continental breakfast,2 queen beds,satelite tv and free wifi."
875953,Pigeontroller,2014-10-08 23:27:00,2793,"Belle River Yacht Club, and Petit Dragon Motel, both in Belle River."
875961,sofabed,2014-10-08 23:58:00,119,There is a place across from Mitchel's Bay Marine unfortunately I forget the name of it. The rooms are cheap and the place is clean
875968,mistaredone,2014-10-09 01:08:00,913,"Parkside cabins in Mitchelles Bay is a great place to stay if your sharing a room with a few guys and it's attached to a good diner. Holiday in in Chatham has lots of parking space if your trailering a boat and is a nice clean 3 1/2 star. The Petite Dragon is cheap with good location, food walking distance away.  Quality Suites downtown windsor is a great spot but you have to arrange docking at a marina and parking for your trailer at the marina"
