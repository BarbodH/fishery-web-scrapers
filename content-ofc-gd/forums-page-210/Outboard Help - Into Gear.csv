When I shift the throttle into forward I hear the rpms increase but it didn't engage into gear....give it a tad more or less throttle and BANG into gear it went.  If I had a passenger standing they would go for a tumble + it can't be good for it to jump into gear at higher rpm's.  1994 40hp (get ready for it) Force by Mercury.  Lets save the Force bashing for another thread  Any tips would be appreciated."

Pop the cowl and move the lever back & forth to see the action of throttle and shift, shift should occur before the throttle advances (make sure the fast idle lever is all the way down on the remote).  Look for the shift cable not being seated right and/or try a bit of adjustment on the threaded portion (might have to unclip it and remove it to adjust).  Also check the lower unit gear oil - see if it's really dirty (ie ground up gears) but I'd think that would really show in performance when in gear as well.  IF none of that helps get it back to the mechanic that did the lower unit - could be an issue in there as well.  Michael"

Possible the fast idle was not all the way down...i'll double check that and hope that is all it was .  Performance regardless is fine.  Speed, planning etc..all normal so I am leaning towards a hopeful adjustment that some how changed while out last weekend."
876984,aplumma,2014-10-16 20:11:00,6896,check the lock nuts on the shifting cables as well the brackets to make sure they are tight. The fast idle lever should have locked out the ability to shift on alot of outboards.  Art
876986,Roe Bag,2014-10-16 20:15:00,246,"Who swapped out the lower unit? There is a linkage rod that runs to the gear case. In order to remove the lower unit the linkage rod must be disconnected. Over the years I've encountered similar problems after replacing a water pump impeller. Sounds to me like the linkage rod may need a little tweeking. Cables have been known to slip over time. They too can prevent forward and reverse from properly engaging. Given the recent replacement of the lower unit, I'm betting it's just a matter of adjusting the linkage rod. Hope this helps and good luck."

Some solid advice hear,good luck with problem..Hopefully no problem soon."
