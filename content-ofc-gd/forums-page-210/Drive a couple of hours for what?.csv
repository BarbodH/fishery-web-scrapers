I PACKED the winter leggings and the parka. Too old to be cold is my motto now. I am also going to wear the boots with liners too. Don't even care who laughs at me, I figure I can fish better without my teeth chattering. LOL.  I was going wading out in the lake and fish the beach until my buddy remembered his pair of waders has a huge hole in the seam where things would get mighty uncomfortable LOL. He is driving, so the pier it is."
