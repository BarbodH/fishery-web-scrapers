876421,Fisherman,2014-10-12 22:58:00,7201,Watching Terry and Brian's videos of fishing.
876463,OhioFisherman,2014-10-13 01:58:00,6623,With those as the choices? The DVD player would get a workout.
876470,Canuck2fan,2014-10-13 02:16:00,1444,"I would just watch any of the series that I haven't seen that magically have appeared on a harddrive I have. I am doing that right now. Wonders of the Monsoon.  I gave up satellite last month because I got sick of paying for so many duplicates of the EXACT same programming. The give you 180 channels but only 15 different shows, at a time, you would even consider, 10 of which are reruns. Great scam for the providers though.  Out of the choices listed though? It is close but Breaking Bad over Walking Dead by the brim of Heisenberg's hat at the finish line."
876752,Rod Caster,2014-10-15 00:13:00,5784,"New season of trailer park boys in Netflix . Fantastic entertainment, especially with the tiny amount of tv I watch nowadays"

876871,Gerritt,2014-10-15 21:31:00,6129,Orange is the new black..... Best show I have seen in a long time. But out of the shows you listed... I would choose breaking bad.  G
876879,Canuck2fan,2014-10-15 23:01:00,1444,"Tonight for me is catching up on episodes #4 and #5 SOA,what a nice show .LOL  SOA is wrapping up a lot of loose ends quickly this season."
