877060,mistaredone,2014-10-17 02:09:00,913,With the current forecast. I wouldn't be out there on Sat in my boat. 30-40km winds
877092,Consigliere,2014-10-17 13:10:00,121,Mitchell Bay might give you some protection from the wind but not a lot.  There are some in there.  In the channels between the reeds there are big walleye and catfish and bass if you get blown off.
