875820,john from craa,2014-10-08 00:29:00,39,"Some of the best resident brown fishing I have enjoyed is on the Salmon River, upper and lower fly zone, and even below in the bait section.  Big, fat browns up to 8 lbs on caddis and stone flies.  And good numbers too.  And that section is wide open to the lake.  Pere Marquette is world renowned for browns...and wide open to lake fish.  Like it or not, Pacific salmon are part of our ecosystem now, as are steelhead, browns, in addition to the native species like brookies, lakers, and perhaps one day Atlantic's, plus bass.  The sad thing is all these dams screw up bass populations and all species of minnows, suckers, dace, etc.  Some of our healthiest rivers have few if any barriers...Wilmot, Bowmanville, Pine, Bighead, etc.  The Bighead has some tremendous resi brown and brookie fishing...and yes, in sections wide open to lake run fish.

875836,John Bacon,2014-10-08 01:56:00,3277,"As for stocking atlantics,They have been doing it for many years. Probly longer then most think. Unless they were stocking back then,stopped and started again in the late 90,s.  I can remember fishing a stretch of the credit at Eldorado park.(again,dating myself here) Up at the rail bridge. I was catching them 6 to 10 inches long. An older fella stopped bye and I showed him one.He told me what they were,I got away from that spot.  Left them alone.  They have been stocking the LeHave strain of Atlantics for a long time.  The LeHave strain are domesticated inbreds.  How successful do you think Ontario's turkey reintroduction would have been if they had used inbred farm turkies?  Stocking of new strains such as the Sebago lake strain is quite recent.  I think we need to give the new program a chance rather than scrap it based on the lack of success of previous approaches to atlantic stocking.  I also wouldn't count on an increase in stocking of other species if the altantic program is ultimately scrapped."

While I appreciate your enthusiasm you absolutely cannot compare resident fisheries in NY and Mi with On. The supplemental stocking done by both states is astronomical and not all naturally produced like here in Ontario. I have no problem with steelhead sharing water with browns as both are non native species. My concern are the brook trout tribs put impassable barriers on them and you got yourself a deal.Edit : Some of my favourite Nith river BT tribs have been overrun with rainbow YOY and smolts since they started getting all the way up to New Hamburg from Erie."

875733,John Bacon,2014-10-07 16:09:00,3277,"Where are they stopped now?  There is a dam on the Kraft property at Streetsville.  The CRAA operates a fish berrier there.  Bows are sent over the dam but cohos and Chinook are not.  Some salmon may make it past the dam on the their own; but that is a pretty big jump.       I think the salmon fishery on the credit is maintained by stocking.  I don't think there is a lot of successful spawning for these species in the credit.  I would like to see them at least let the coho past the dam.  The Chinook fishery can easily be maintained via stocking.  Rainbow are stocked in the credit as well.  So it is hard to say if they need help or not.  We don't know how they would be doing without help.  As far as reducing the atlantic program to help chinook/steelhead/cohu; much the money raised for the Atlantic program has been raised specifically for restoring the atlantic salmon.  These funds would not be available for stocking of other species if the atlantic program was scrapped.  So, eliminating the atlantic program will not benefit other species."

Why use a hatchery to grow chinooks when you could let them spawn on thier own.

875801,john from craa,2014-10-07 22:13:00,39,"Musky or Specks - your note (19) proves the need for allowing access past Norval.  Temperature!  The Credit River hits 82-84F at Norval in summer.  Too hot for steelhead, coho or browns and Atlantic's.  Only during cold wet summers can salmon and trout survive in decent numbers below Norval Dam.  Water temps in Streetsville now peak at 87F.  CRAA has made great progress by planting 470,000 trees along the river and tributaries to shade the river, but the rapidly expanding urban areas are destroying tributaries and further reducing the lower river (below Norval) health.  Beeton Creek is also a very different system.  It is fed by localized groundwater inputs from the north side of the Oak ridges moraine, along with drumlin fields and other smaller moraines with a surficial geology of sandy loam, sand, and gravel.  Beeton Creek's limiting factors are agricultural drains, weeping tile, deforestation of the riparian zone and low gradient for much of the system.  The lower Credit's geology is 100% clay and shale.  The groundwater transmisivity of the Credit watershed downstream of Norval and east of the Credit to Inglewood is 1/1000 to 1/10,000 compared to the upper river above and west of Norval.  Bottom line, the Credit River below Norval has virtually no ground water inputs, no springs, no aquifers and no cold water tributaries that are needed to support juvenile trout and salmon.  The very limited potential the area had was destroyed in the early 1800's by deforestation and erosion of the top soils and damage is further amplified by parking lots, roof tops and roads in Brampton and Mississauga.  Water temps in the Credit peak around 74F from Inglewood to Terra Cotta.  Groundwater from the northwest side (Escarpment and Amabel formations) maintain cool water that is heated by the sun from reduced forest cover, widening stream channel and agricultural impacts.  From Terra Cotta to Glen Williams water temps now peak about 77F.  CRAA's reforestation of three farms has dramatically improved this reach.  One farm had no trees over 700m with water temps increasing by 5F.  This farm was the start of the thermal kill zone that lasted all the way to Port Credit before we planted it.  18,000 trees in that single 700m section alone and trout could live throughout it (if they could get there).  The last major groundwater input to the Credit occurs from where the CRAA hatchery is downstream for 3km.  Huge alluvial deposits allow groundwater from the west to enter the river where temps actually drop 2F.  The river then enters the Queenston shale section (red clay/shale) with no ground water where it flows for 7km to Norval.  Water temps shoot up through here and in the head pond at Norval where the river becomes lethal to trout.  Silver Creek adds some cool water, but not enough to lower temps below 80F.  From Norval to Port Credit the river flows through the Georgian Bay clay and shale formation with no groundwater to speak of.  The river is wide, poorly forested and heats up in the sun.  Our efforts to reforest the river have helped...but undoing the damage of 200 years will take a century or more for the river to recover, narrow, deepen and mature old growth trees to shade it.  There is plenty of spawning habitat, but the fry/parr normally die from heat stress by late June.  Winter survival is reduced due to anchor ice.  Egg survival is reduced by high sediment from farms, development and roads.  A large part of CRAA's efforts have been using temperature loggers to monitor stream temps.  It is maximum temperature and overnight recovery that are of primary concern.  Max Temps (now (2013 and then 1998)  Inglewood        74F/23.3C  (2012-13)                    76F/24.4C (1998)  Good overnight recovery Terra Cotta      74F/23.3C (2012-13)                     77F/25C  moderate overnight recovery Terra Cotta - Rogers Creek  72-74F (2012-13)       85-88F (30-31C) (1998)  Removal of dams and online ponds (2003-2009) Glen Williams  76F/24.4C (2012-13)                       86F/30C (1998)  moderate recovery Norval              82-84F/28C (now)                             87F/30.5C (1998)  poor recovery Huttonville        85F/29C                                            89F/31.7C (1998)    poor recovery Streetsville       87F/30.5C                                         95F/35C (1998)  poor recovery  As you can see, all sites below Norval have peak summer temps that are lethal to trout.  There are no cold water tributaries and no ground water discharges to create micro habitat survival.  The only chance are storm sewer discharges that come out of cement pipes that cool water until a storm hits and the fish seeking refuge are killed by a blast of hot water from road and parking lot runoff.  The Credit's chinook run is 10-15% wild based on clip returns (recent years).  It was higher (20-40% wild) prior to 2004 (based on PhD study) when more chinooks passed Streetsville before DFO changed the dam to stop lamprey.  Chinook runs were 20-30,000 in the late 80's, and have now declined to 5-10k at best.  Reduced stocking and reduced survival of stocked chinook because of massive wild chinook numbers are the primary causes IMO.  Bowmanville's chinook run is twice as big (and all wild), yet the Credit is 11 times larger (watershed size).  The steelhead run is now around 20,000.  This is due to CRAA's adult transfers past Norval and the cold summers of 2009 and 2010.  Transfers have been reduced and typical summers (hot/dry) in 2011, 2012 and 2013 mean returns will drop quite a bit in the coming years.  Cohos are sustained through stocking because they cannot access adequate habitat.  Brook trout and resident brown trout that drop below dams are trapped and would die from heat stress too.  Dams and deforestation destroyed a run of between 100,000 and 300,000 Atlantic salmon in the Credit.  Yet a few people seem to think keeping those same dams around is a good thing.  The US is removing dams every day from their rivers.  Check out the Elwha or Condit Dam videos on YouTube.  John"
875809,Salmonidstalker,2014-10-07 23:19:00,265," I too enjoy resident brown trout fishing; however I do believe, in my own opinion, that all trout can live together and can benefit from each other just as they intermingle successfully on many many other rivers like the Beaver River, the Bighead River, the Ganaraska River, Wilmot Creek, Bowmanville Creek, the Nottawasage River just to name a few.  I believe that it would be of benefit to the river to see all fish have a barrier free environment.  All of those rivers I've named boast fantastic populations of steelhead, salmon, along side a healthy population of resident trout.  ALL, due to the fact that fish have unrestricted access to prime spawning waters."
