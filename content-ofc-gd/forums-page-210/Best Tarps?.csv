Although they are considerably more expensive, I started buying the heavier tarps that are sold at feed/farm supply stores and I don't mean TSC. Just bought my second one this year only because the one I bought 5 years ago was just starting to have grommet problems. Here in Owen Sound, I buy them from the  Co-op ( Huron Bay Co-op. ) My new 20 ft X 30 ft was $ 107. + tax but worth every cent."

876450,Fishinbum,2014-10-13 01:27:00,9,Our tarps are from trucking companies.  Used to cover lumber and other stuff during shipping. we actually have post and beam out building built from these that are 10 years old.  With tons of trucking companies around stop in at a few and ask. A pickup truck load cost us $50
