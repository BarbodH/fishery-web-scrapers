I have heard that some people are getting out on st. john but I don't want to head out on 2"" of ice.   As for Couch it probably isn't safe but you never know.  If anybody has any info on these lakes that would be great.  Post of PM, whichever you like  JFish"
24380,crappieperchhunter,2007-01-20 01:24:00,2582,Planning a run up to Couch Sunday for a look see. If I make it up I will report...good or bad...what I see.

I was hoping for at least one report on the ice up there but I guess it might not happen, lol.  It's very hard to get reports of ice on couch I have found.  Not sure if it's just that not many people live around it or if they just don't want to post.  JFish"
