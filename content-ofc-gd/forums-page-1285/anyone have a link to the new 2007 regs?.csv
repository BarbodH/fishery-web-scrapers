24435,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-20 06:00:00,1351,I can't seem to find the regulations for the 2007 season. I've been to canadian tire to ask for them but they told me they won't be getting them for another month or so. So.. what should i do?

24529,BabyHerc,2007-01-20 17:54:00,285,The new regs have been postponed.  MNR has advised us to use the 2006 regs for this year as well.
