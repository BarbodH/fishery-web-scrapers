24277,Pope29,2007-01-19 17:56:00,29,"Can anyone give me a heads up on the ice conditions on the northern inland lakes. Anywhere between Elliot lake and Wawa, I'm willing to travel a bit if I have to. Will be in Sault Ste Marie and fishing Sun and Mon if anyone wants to hook up to do some Speck fishing.  Pope"
24281,Roy,2007-01-19 18:10:00,13728,"I have no idea what ice conditions are in that area.  I'd imagine that smaller lakes would have 4"" at the very least.  BTW....you can fish Tuesday and Wednesday as well if your campfire spews white smoke. It means you've been replaced back home and you no longer have a job."
24302,Pope29,2007-01-19 19:18:00,29,  What a blessing that would be
24347,Pope29,2007-01-19 23:05:00,29,Bump...no Northerners here???
24357,smitter,2007-01-19 23:28:00,106,"Lots of safe ice on all the small to medium sized inland lakes. Went out last weekend just north of town. 8"" of clear solid ice. Still, be careful, lots of lakes up here are spring fed and can have weak spots. We've had a bit of snow in the last couple of days so it could be hiding some bad ice."
24361,Pope29,2007-01-19 23:42:00,29,Hey Smitter...thanks for the reply..I lived up there for the first 19 years of my life so I'm familiar with the lakes I have in mind. Heard any reports from Robertson or Sil at all???
24379,troutologist,2007-01-20 01:18:00,951,Ice is safe up there my buddies have had sleds on the lakes for 2 weeks now.  Sil has always been better early in the year than robertson for me. but i know some nice fish have came out of there. luck
24414,smitter,2007-01-20 03:27:00,106,"I got nothin' on those 2 lakes, but everyone at work is reporting that lakers and specks are both hitting good right now."
24420,Pope29,2007-01-20 03:46:00,29,Thanks for the info guys....feel better bout driving all that way now...thought I might get stuck at mom in laws for two days
24479,Bob,2007-01-20 14:52:00,370,"Yep, lotsa ice in the Elliot Lake area. Just stay away from currents."
