A couple of my other forum sites have the option and its great.......itll only show me new replies to my posts? I can go in and not have to locate or fish thru to find if theres any unread responses to my posts......just hit a button and there they are. Then i can go hit the new unread posts and ALL new unread posts that everyone else has posted throughout the day, or since i last logged on are up for me to peruse thru?"
