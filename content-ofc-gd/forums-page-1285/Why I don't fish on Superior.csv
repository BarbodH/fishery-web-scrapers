24506,nelly,2007-01-20 16:28:00,256,Those photos were amazing Dan. That is why I like to fish inland lakes.
24188,SlowPoke,2007-01-19 08:51:00,2984,"Dan, You just need a bigger boat http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8859132516960951251  Nauti, with all due respect I don't think there is enough water in Lake Erie to make waves like that.  -Brian"
24189,lew,2007-01-19 10:06:00,12767,"Thanks Dan, some great pictures there and there's nothing more impressive or powerful, than BIG storms on BIG waters, and Superior certainly comes by her name honestly !!  I've had the pleasure (usually) of crossing the Atlantic Ocean quite a few times and it's absolutely incredible how rough it can be sometimes. Storms can, and often do,  last for days and the worst I ever saw was 75' waves, which is pretty undaunting when your ship isn't much more than 300'  One minute your riding the top of the mountain, and then seconds later your bow is stuffed under a wall of water the size of an apartment building.  Not sure if the term to describe massive waves is exhilarating or terrifying  Again Dan, thanks for the great pictures and rekindling some awesome memories."
24192,misfish,2007-01-19 11:17:00,29133,"I have heard a few scary stories about how Erie can man a mouse out of ya,but those waves would make ya crap yer pants.   Now I wonder, how many of the bass guys would love to jump those waves.   Nice photos Dan."
24199,crappiesteve,2007-01-19 12:19:00,220,"...Wow,must be a new way to wash the ships,cause thats one hell of a rinse cycle. Steve"
24201,Marc Thorpe,2007-01-19 12:22:00,621,Only questions I have Did tha boat sink or come out from under the wave?
24203,solopaddler,2007-01-19 12:31:00,8605,Look's like my kinda water. Time to grab the kayak
24204,SlowPoke,2007-01-19 12:33:00,2984,"I'd imagine so, we probably wouldn't be seeing pictures otherwise. I've seen some pretty wild footage on TV and unless they break in half, they'll go through just about anything!  -Brian"
24205,dheitzner,2007-01-19 12:46:00,314,"   so true!  check an atlas and see how many eries you could fit in superior, not to mention the depth!!!"
24224,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-19 14:15:00,0,"Incredible pics Dan, Wow."
24245,BITEME,2007-01-19 16:09:00,1969,Cool shots Dan makes me all tinglely  Im with Lew once upon a time I would have considered that a nice day on the water You understand life in 100 footers WATER THE ULTIMATE POWER
24246,Headhunter,2007-01-19 16:16:00,5703,"Now that's what I call a Walleye Chop! Great shots! I'm assuming that one would troll down wind in that?   the run back up those waves though, would certainly separate the men from the boys! HH"
24280,Nemo,2007-01-19 18:10:00,727,"Hmm same shots different forum.  http://www.myccr.com/SectionForums/viewtopic.php?t=20431  ""found out after I posted this pictures that were taken on the North Atlantic-not Superior as I was lead to beleive. Sorry about that!! ""  Still neat shots though..."
24299,Pigeontroller,2007-01-19 19:13:00,2793,"WOW!   The legend lives on from the chippewa on down Of the big lake they called gitche gumee The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead When the skies of november turn gloomy With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more Than the edmund fitzgerald weighed empty. That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed When the gales of november came early."
24300,hawkeye,2007-01-19 19:14:00,162,"Awsome pic's, reminds me of the good old days. USS Parle and USS Daniel A Joy. They were both the flagships of the, now get this, Great Lakes fleet. WW2 DE's 1500 tons 300 ft long. The ""fleet"" consisted of one of them, a few mine sweepers and believe it or not a sub. Parle was the last US Navy ship stationed in the lakes. Homeported out of Detroit.  I saw some rough weather on Erie and Ontario but nothing like the pictures. Worse I ever saw was off Hatteras when the Parle took a 45 degree roll. The old hands said that she'd go to 55 degrees and still come back but I would not want to see that. Talk about walking on the bulkheads and some soiled skivvies   thanks for the pic's"
24305,dwc67,2007-01-19 19:26:00,140,take a couple of dramamine and turn on the bilge.
24306,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-19 19:28:00,4399,Note to self...Stay off Superior.  Awesome pictures thanks for sharing!
24330,Guidofisherman,2007-01-19 22:14:00,206,"I also lived on the shores of Lake Superior all of my life and have a lot of respect for the power of this vast lake. I've been caught in waves large enough to launch a 23 foot boat clear out of the water and even more scary is the fog. On one trip, several 20 ft+ boat went to Isle Royale for several days of fishing. When I got back I happened to tell my dad and did he get mad saying,""Was I nuts...that lake gets rough!' He used to be a helmsman on the lakers that Dan pictured and said the wheelhouse on the laker was 32 feet above the waterline and he had seen waves break over it. Its 'fair weather fishing from now on"". Alan"
24333,mattyk,2007-01-19 22:34:00,2110,Lake S is pretty much a fresh water ocean. Those are some nasty waves!
24349,danc,2007-01-19 23:11:00,4677,"  Could very well be Nemo. The photos arrived in my e mail stating that they were taken on Superior. But you know how the stories get twisted around on the internet these days. On the other hand, if Superior can snap the Edmond Fitzgerald in half, (one of the theories) it can certainly wash over a boat as the photos show."
24359,Rich Clemens,2007-01-19 23:36:00,3131,I hear stories of the feroceous storms on Superior.  Scary looking pics there ... not a place I would want to be.
24372,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-20 00:56:00,2585, I met an older guy at lebarons in missasuaga a few years ago and he was telling me that he was on on the crew of the anderson and said that the 2 scariest things he has gone through is fog on superior and storms on superiour.  He then went on to tell me how he would take the north atlantic's rough waters anyday over superiors rough water!  Cheers!
24411,Garyv,2007-01-20 03:23:00,547,Angus Graham was a Esso Captain and a customer of ours after he retired.  He was out the night the Fitzgerald went down and heard the inter ship communications.  He claimed that in all his years on the Great Lakes he never saw a storm as bad as that day.  He also felt that the mistake the Fitz made was trying to save time and outrun the worst part of the storm by cutting through an area that in calm conditions took skill and manuaverability as there was a rocky bottom that was shallow in spots and required constant monitoring. He said the ship probably came into contact with the bottom and fractured the hull and eventually stressed to the point where she broke.  His feelings I believe have been confirmed by underwater photos and video's over the years.
24428,Nemo,2007-01-20 04:22:00,727,DanC not questioning your post.  Cool pics as I said regardless.  As you say the internet is always twisting stuff  Funny thing is chances are what I posted is Bull as well.  Just wanted to make sure OFNer's had all the details.
24434,dustink,2007-01-20 05:53:00,526,"uh, yeah....that's scary.  dk"
24436,POLLIWOGG,2007-01-20 06:01:00,835,"If you like this sort of stuff, go down to your library and see if they have a copy of the video, I think its called Around Cape Horn, by Irving Johnson.  Irving took a movie camera on one of the last clipper ships way back when the cameras where a new thing.  He shows a storm on the north Atlantic but the real storm was going around the horn. You got huge waves going over the ship and this guy films it from the top of the mast.  Its a great video showing life at sea at the turn of the century and the numbers on the ship are amazing as one sail would weigh into the tons and all rigged by hand.  Gary I don't think the Fitz had a depth finder. Radar was the amazing new technology of the day so the didn't bother with a depth finder."
24049,danc,2007-01-19 02:24:00,4677,"It's nice living on the shores of Lake Superior. It's the cleanest and the largest of the Great Lakes and the fishing is fantastic. I've lived on her shorelines my entire life, but I've only fished on Superior a few times.  Here's why.          "
24055,tjsa,2007-01-19 02:30:00,1578,"Chicken.....................................LOL.  Been out in less than half that weather, and scared the bejeessus out of me. Lucky to still be here to even post this response.  Did ya land anything Dan??? I figger the net man had to be really , really , good!!"
24056,Fisherman,2007-01-19 02:30:00,7201,"No detailed explanation required for me, thanks.  Man that is beyond nasty."
24057,Crazyhook,2007-01-19 02:30:00,1154,Is that the Atlantic?!
24063,nautifish,2007-01-19 02:38:00,1416,We get those big tankers here to on lake E dan that go out to hydro @ nanticoke with coal and such. & The weather gets just as bad if not worse. Which is why we  have a memorial for all the fisherman that have lost there lives on this lake here in port dover.
24070,Bernie,2007-01-19 02:47:00,3190,Wow   No wonder Gordon Lightfoot wrote the song.
24072,Carp,2007-01-19 02:50:00,1488,There must be some days when the weather is calm enough ? That last pic is amazing.  Big Lake. Lots of room for winds to pick up speed.
24073,tjsa,2007-01-19 02:51:00,1578,"No, Naughti, Superior can be much worse than down south.  The Edmund Fitzgerald fell fate to Superior 30 yrs. ago, in probably much worse weather.  Gordon Lightfoot's haunting song about it is a testament to its loss."
24078,Grimace,2007-01-19 02:53:00,2020,Great pictures.  thats awesome power.  those waves have to be 50 feet high
24079,Rich,2007-01-19 02:55:00,3927,I dont understand.. where's the downriggers?
24080,Crazyhook,2007-01-19 02:56:00,1154,they replaced white buckets with Red bins
24083,Rich,2007-01-19 02:58:00,3927,"Yes CH, that's one of my favourite mods to the Bass Hound 2007 Edition."
24085,nautifish,2007-01-19 02:59:00,1416,  Ohhh Tjsa trust me i know that song like the back of my hand. WHEN I USED TO LIVE ON MAIN STREET GOT TO HEAR A LOCAL HERE sing it every sunday afternoon here in PD & i mean every single sunday afternoon through the season because the bar across the street used to put speakers outside on the front step.  But yes we do get really nasty weather here on lake E and it can change at the blink of an eye. I do have some pics some where gotta try N find em.  & CRAZY.....LMDAO.
24089,GbayGiant,2007-01-19 03:05:00,1780,Looks more like an ocean in those pics.

24099,ShaunB,2007-01-19 03:21:00,73,Those are some crazy vids.  My uncle was the first officer on the HMCS toronto and told me stories of them being in such rough water that when the boat listed you could walk on the walls of the ship!!!!
24109,ccmtcanada,2007-01-19 03:37:00,7971,Wow...the power is just unbelievable!!!  I wouldn't want to be on that boat...fishing or not!!!
24111,Nemo,2007-01-19 03:40:00,727,Cool Mepps. Here is a vid that shows what happens inside the ship.    You can see the ship flexing from bow to stern from the inside.
24112,Crazyhook,2007-01-19 03:43:00,1154,rough for a 14 foot tinny
24137,Joey,2007-01-19 04:03:00,9122,Surf's Up!!!  Really cool pictures Dan.  Joey
24186,steverowbotham,2007-01-19 07:16:00,1800,"That is a mean looking lake.  I have fished on Erie and Simcoe in 7 footers, but that is zero compared to that! WOW!"
