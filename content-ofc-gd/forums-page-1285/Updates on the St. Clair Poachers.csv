23822,mattyk,2007-01-18 15:59:00,2110,Thanks for the effort. This just shows that we all need to vigilant to protect our resources.
23853,fishnsled,2007-01-18 17:20:00,3520,"Thanks for your efforts Ron.  As dwc67 said.....   Just razzing ya.     I guess there's an arguement for having a camera with more megapixels.  Now if you can explain that one to the wife you'll be good to go.  A new SLR digital with 10 megapixels and a kick donkey zoom lens. Not only will you get better pictures of these poachers, just think of the owl shots you'll get!  Thanks again Ron."
23888,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-18 19:15:00,0,"Thanks for the update Ron, it's nice to see your efforts acknowledged."
23976,setomonkey,2007-01-18 23:49:00,872,"It was a good effort, hopefully the attention from this site and the knowledge that there are people out there who will take photos and will contact the MNR will make a few think twice about purposefully breaking the regs...  Mike"
23987,keiths,2007-01-19 00:15:00,30,"I don't see any registration numbers in that pic. But I do see a couple thieves trying to make off with what they shouldn't. After all, poaching is stealing, and they are stealing from the rest of us."
23991,huntervasili,2007-01-19 00:23:00,1604,I am gonna post this pic on all the forums I am a member of ..If a new lead/pic arrives i will let you all know... as well if anyone has a problem with this please PM me...
24517,nelly,2007-01-20 17:12:00,256,It's just a matter of time before this boat and these guys will be spotted. Big brother and OFC'er will be watching.
23553,Ron,2007-01-17 21:30:00,1683,"I just received an email back from the Conservation Officer who I had sent an affidavit and photos to in regards of the 2 guys fishing with several rods.  In my eyes, these poachers were very fortunate of the conditions (weather, time of day, etc...)  Here is the email I received.  Greetings:  I would first like to thank you all for taking the time to get involved and assist us with this investigation. Most people wouldn't bother.  Unfortunately I will be unable to lay any charges against these individuals.  I submitted every possible combination of registration numbers I could think of to Canada Customs and unfortunately came up empty. I then submitted the digital photos you folks provided to the Technical Services Branch of the OPP to be enhanced. I was advised by them that the number of pixels in the photo were not of a sufficient enough number for their programs to be able to clarify the registration numbers.  We will have to be satisfied that the exposure you provided on your website regarding this matter got the message out loud and clear that this activity is unacceptable. I believe that it also put people on notice that they never know who may be watching them and taking photos.  Once again I would like to thank you and I hope you will not hestitate to work with us in the future.  Yours truly,  ****** **** - Conservation Officer Ministry of Natural Resources  Next time, these guys won't be so lucky "
23557,dwc67,2007-01-17 21:35:00,140,"nice try ron  ""I then submitted the digital photos you folks provided to the Technical Services Branch of the OPP to be enhanced. I was advised by them that the number of pixels in the photo were not of a sufficient enough number for their programs to be able to clarify the registration numbers.""  next time don't buy such a cheap camera"
23559,Terry,2007-01-17 21:36:00,14456,damn...oh well like he said lots of people have seen the photos and they may think twice before doing it again
23562,snag,2007-01-17 21:50:00,1932,Maybe we should start a contest here with a prize/reward for information that leads to a conviction?  Someone has to know these guys?
23563,wuchikubo,2007-01-17 21:50:00,1114,And here I was hoping that this would be news that they caught the poachers.  I hate it when poachers get away with it when almost everyone else plays by the rules!
23566,lew,2007-01-17 21:57:00,12767,"It was a good try anyways Ron.  I remember watching them launch that boat and head out from the harbour while we were all sitting in the restaurant having breakfast that day on the pier.  I'm sure they've somehow got wind of this ongoing investigation by now, so I doubt if we'll see them in the area again, but if we do, they can be sure there'll be ALOT more cameras pointed at them next time !!"
23567,blaque,2007-01-17 21:59:00,2419,Thats classic that the one guy is looking back right at the camera. Wheres the rest of the pics.
23569,Crazyhook,2007-01-17 22:01:00,1154,hopefully that officer is angry about not being able to track them down and will find them next season doing the same thing
23571,TAH,2007-01-17 22:03:00,133,thanks for trying Ron
23573,Joey,2007-01-17 22:07:00,9122,"Thanks for the update Ron.  We should all carry a wallet size photo of them in our boats this year and see if we recognize them, then get the proper numbers that the authorities need.  Joey"
23575,Grimace,2007-01-17 22:11:00,2020,he certainly wont be outrunning anyone with that 30 horse  Next CO thats see's him can swim over and bust him
23583,Gerritt,2007-01-17 22:39:00,6129,Ron I also just got in and just got the same email from Conservation Officer Dietz... it is a shame they could not finger the pricks...  I gave them what I had... hoping it would help...   Well I would not hesitate in the future to do the same again!  sucks they didnt get caught though....may they burn in hell.... as the will do be doing it again.  Gerritt.
23587,GbayGiant,2007-01-17 22:50:00,1780,"To crazy, I hope they caught no fish and got the worst tangle in the history of fishing."
23593,mason05,2007-01-17 23:14:00,258, I like the cut of your jib snag.  That is an excellent idea.  What do you say Admin???  Corn Nug
23601,dheitzner,2007-01-17 23:29:00,314, LOL  good work ron
23619,huntervasili,2007-01-17 23:52:00,1604,well if we see em we could just toss a chain or some rope in theyr prop till the co comes... no matter how long it takes...
23625,Roy,2007-01-18 00:22:00,13728,I think that the good people involved in the attempted apprehension of these two guys have already done more than could have been expected. The attempt should and will at least serve as a reminder to other people that folks are watching them now. I'm quite certain that these two guys won't be trying the same stunt anytime soon.  There's also the possibility that this investigation is far from over and that MNR wanted the sent email to go public.  Personally I would leave this one as it is and just encourage people to be more vigilant.
23629,danc,2007-01-18 00:41:00,4677,"This should be looked at as a victory for all involved. Surely these creeps are aware of our efforts here and will think twice next time. They're probably breathing a collective sigh of relief today. But as Roy said, it's not over 'til it's over. Hats off to everyone involved. Good work guys. You made a difference. We'll get them next time."
23642,Pigeontroller,2007-01-18 01:07:00,2793,"I will gladly donate one new Muskie lure to the next/best picture of this particular boat, anyone else?"
23648,jjcanoe,2007-01-18 01:23:00,744,"8 rods and 2 guys, maybe there were some leprechans in the boat?  jjcanoe"
23659,bigfish1965,2007-01-18 01:33:00,3382,Like Officer Dietz said..this is in no way a defeat. The poachers know we have a myriad of people watching and we are not afraid to report. Kudos to all those involved.
23668,fishindevil,2007-01-18 01:46:00,6254,well at least the effort was made and that it sent a message that is very clear...YOU ARE BEING WATCHED..POACHERS  thanks for trying     cheers    shawn
23677,Carp,2007-01-18 01:59:00,1488,"[quote name='snag' date='Jan 17 2007, 04:50 PM' post='23562'  Someone has to know these guys?      I'm sure these guys have heard or seen that they were photographed and reported to the MNR. I'll bet that boat has been well hidden since that day. Lots of people will be looking for it.  I have a new cell phone that does the picture thing as well as video. Look out poachers."
23746,steverowbotham,2007-01-18 05:35:00,1800,"I have the MNR Crimestoppers logged into my cell phone, I cant stand poaching!  Which is also why I'm at Fleming College studying to be a C.O."
23813,Puckhead,2007-01-18 15:08:00,377,"Unfortunate that it didn't work out. In my opinion though, the exposure on OFC surely has made a lot of people who would do the same, think twice about it.  Which is the goal at the end of the day anyway so good work guys!"
