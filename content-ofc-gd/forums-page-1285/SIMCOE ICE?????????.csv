23078,gforce,2007-01-16 18:50:00,63,A friend had invited me to go ice fishing on Simcoe last summer.....  We picked January 27th for kicks!  Well..... looks like we did not see this coming.  Any projections of when the ice will be safe?
23089,Rich,2007-01-16 19:23:00,3927,"January 14th, 2014"
23090,Terry,2007-01-16 19:26:00,14456,"you didn't say what part of lake simcoe there should be places to fish on cooks bay by that date and there will be places to fish near orillia, snake island georgian island the following weekend but some parts of the lake may not have safe ice to well into feb. if at all"
23092,dwc67,2007-01-16 19:29:00,140,it depends on what your definition of safe is. mine is 4 inches and i will likely be on cooks bay that weekend
23132,PERCHER,2007-01-16 21:29:00,787,My guess would be the same as Terry's.
23135,Clampet,2007-01-16 21:33:00,1947,Once the first bunch of anglers stop breaking through voila - it is now safe  .
23136,urbanangler1990,2007-01-16 21:38:00,933," easy to do, all ya gotta do is observe"
23218,FinS,2007-01-17 00:27:00,463,if the cold stays with us it should be good by the beginning of february
23231,bucktail,2007-01-17 00:59:00,1857,January 17th 7am!
23237,ccmtcanada,2007-01-17 01:11:00,7971,Lorissa posted this link about Simcoe Ice Fishing....  http://www.originalicefishingcontest.com/ontario.htm  They've cancelled the tourny there that was scheduled for Feb 3rd because of lack of ice.
23253,RickOnt,2007-01-17 02:01:00,669,To-Day at the end of the Gilford Looking south it is ice as far as you can see!!!  Looking to Crates there is about 200'-300' of ice then open water.  Looking to the North there is ice out past Kon Tiki's Red and Green buoy. Then all open water.  Right now -13C in Gilford and no wind and light snow.  If the temps stay down and no wind we could be Perch fishing by the End of Jan.
23353,misfish,2007-01-17 11:11:00,29133,COOK BAY THIS SATURDAY. HERE FISHY FISHY
23355,Terry,2007-01-17 11:22:00,14456,I think I just might wait one more week before I hit cooks
23358,misfish,2007-01-17 11:41:00,29133," Yeah,you should wait.LOL  Check yer pm,s later dude."
23464,Kirk,2007-01-17 17:16:00,347,The traditional time for me when Jacksons Point is a parking lot for a few days.  (Or the first van from Scarborough goes thru...)
23477,steverowbotham,2007-01-17 17:50:00,1800,"Cook's Bay is completely frozen over now, and Kempefelt Bay froze over last night.  The ice is still not safe though.  If this cold keeps up, you'll probably be okay to fish on the 27th.  But please check with hut operators and bait shops before venturing out.  Hopefully the ice will be good!"
24292,gforce,2007-01-19 18:53:00,63,thanks for all the replys!  patience is the key for now.
