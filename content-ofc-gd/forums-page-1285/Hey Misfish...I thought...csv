24233,Roy,2007-01-19 14:53:00,13728,"Wayne, I'm trying to imagine the size of the eagles out your way from eating Christmas dinner everyday."
24240,Puckhead,2007-01-19 15:36:00,377,Those pics are making me hungry... mmmmmm....  I think I'm going to have a turkey sandwich for lunch today
24513,nelly,2007-01-20 16:59:00,256,"93+ turkeys will be more than plenty for the M&G. (LOL) Irishfield, where were these pictures taken from? And how high can turkey fly."
23915,irishfield,2007-01-18 21:25:00,26272,They are getting worse than Canada Geese! HELP !

23929,irishfield,2007-01-18 21:49:00,26272, Glad I could bring you out of hiding TJ ...LOL  Them that in the picture (32 of them) is minor....counted 93 in the line following each other thru the forest yesterday..and I'm sure I missed a few.
23931,Greencoachdog,2007-01-18 21:54:00,8163,"There's a bag limit on them yanno... and my favorite kind of Wild Turkey is for drinkin', not shootin' or eatin'."
23932,Terry,2007-01-18 21:55:00,14456,maybe you should have a OFC m&g there and everyone has to catch or shoot their own lunch.......yum fresh turkey
23933,fishnsled,2007-01-18 21:58:00,3520,I'm on my way!!!     
23936,Clampet,2007-01-18 22:13:00,1947,Thank you for sharing some pictures we seldom see of wild turkeys in their own enviro. Looks like they are doing well.
23939,lew,2007-01-18 22:19:00,12767,"Hey Clampet, I thought fer sure you'd be offering up one of Grannies backwoods recipes for those gobblers"
23941,motv8tr,2007-01-18 22:33:00,2587,"Ya, I got them here too, have to dodge them as I head down the road...not quite that many though, maybe a dozen or so...  Maureen"
23943,irishfield,2007-01-18 22:39:00,26272,4 years ago it was only one Hen in the yard Maureen. Wait till next year and you'll be able to swerve for fresh meat every night on the way home!
23946,Bernie,2007-01-18 22:43:00,3190,Better get a male shipped in from another area to prevent too much inbreeding. Any input on this Clampet?
23951,irishfield,2007-01-18 22:55:00,26272,Lots of Toms with these Hens. But you are right..they are going to get like the three legged / dumb deers of Oro-Medonte a few years back from inbreeding.
23955,pameladallaire,2007-01-18 22:57:00,470,I just showed my husband the picks.  He said fill the plane and drop them off at our dock.  Pam
23963,POLLIWOGG,2007-01-18 23:17:00,835,"Not very often you see them walk in line, usually  if 93 birds cross a grain field there will be 93 paths accross the field.  If you shoot a half dozen of them in the head they'll learn not to come back for a while, I sometimes have to take out a few to keep them out of the sweet corn."
23986,crappiesteve,2007-01-19 00:13:00,220,"Wayne,you must be a tom,   cause thier all hens man,from what I see nail a few I,ll deep fry them,for you.  Steve"
23989,irishfield,2007-01-19 00:19:00,26272,I was takin pics thru the back window as they ran away so didn't get a good look. Don't think there were any Toms in with the 32 today. Maybe one. There's usually about 7 Toms out with the Ladies. Those birds are a LOT bigger in person than they look in those shots. I bet they each go 15 to 20 lbs.
23997,crappiesteve,2007-01-19 00:39:00,220,"...yeah thats normaly thier wieght Wanye,but there are some biigger ones. Saw some tracks in back of my place,but was only one walking threw,unusaual for this time of year.it,s good to see them .  Steve"
23999,Bernie,2007-01-19 00:39:00,3190,I wonder with the climate warming up if they will eventually make their way up in this territory. Not sure what they taste like yet but i bet they would be great done up in the deep fryer.   Maybe bag one or two up there Irish and bring it to Lakair.
24010,tjsa,2007-01-19 00:48:00,1578,"Guess what, there are wild turkey seminars going to be held up here in Thunder Bay, and we ain't got no turkeys here, other than the usual 2 footed types, but who knows with the weather now. Heard reports of people pheasant hunting(not sure its legal) down south of us toward the minnesota border. Only pheasants I have seen have been in the minneapolis area, but who knows, some people buy them and breed them, some escape. Some people up here have a small herd of Hart Deer!!!!!!    Why, who knows. They occasionally escape, and make the news."
24015,danc,2007-01-19 00:59:00,4677,"  Better have a closer look Tom. They're here, but in small numbers. I haven't seen any personally, but I know several people that have."
