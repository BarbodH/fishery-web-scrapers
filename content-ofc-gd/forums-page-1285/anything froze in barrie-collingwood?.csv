24574,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-20 20:06:00,1351,"lol, i was thinking of that.. haha"
24577,steverowbotham,2007-01-20 20:13:00,1800,"I just got a report that there is about 2 inches of blue ice and about an inch of white ice, so pretty much... they are dumb haha.  But, it will be super cold tonight so who knows for tomorrow.  At least there are always docks there, and perch all around you."
