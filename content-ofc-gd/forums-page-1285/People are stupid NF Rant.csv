23962,smellin fishy,2007-01-18 23:16:00,21,"1.   Zach, how did they get your #? 2.   Who are these people? 3.    Where are they calling from.     4.    I have had a tellemarketer calling my house daily for the last month.  They call, and when I pick up the phone, I hear ""click"" and nobody is on the other end of the line.  It's the same number every time.  So there I am..... Falling asleep after my midnight shift and the phone rings long distance.  It's my tellemarketer buddy.  Now I'm pissed absolutly F%*%G FREAKING OUT  .  I lost it.  I was in another world.  I was in such rage thet I could have body slammed a grizzly bear.  So I call the tellemarketer.  Long story short; i'm on the  ""Don't call list-an absolute trigger happy nut job lives at that adress and he scares the poop out of me list""  Steve"
24008,Peter Panfish,2007-01-19 00:48:00,46," Yeah I definately know what you mean lew, and I wouldn't complain if the people who were calling were being nice about it, but the people who I had to deal with were just a step off of being barbaric about it. I totally don't have a problem with anyone calling, even if I've never met them, as long as they are polite.  Edit:  Got shouted at about something so I take that back nevermind."
24081,Rich,2007-01-19 02:57:00,3927,"Tell us the ice conditions, you idiot!  Just kidding!!"
23884,Squid,2007-01-18 18:39:00,1656,Hey Zack. How about writing down some of the callers numbers and handing them out to callers who ask for ice conditions. Tell them that the number is a hotline for conditions. That will learn them
23902,~CK~,2007-01-18 20:24:00,30,"That's horrible.  OK I'm going to admit to something and hope I don't get shot... *DEEP BREATH* I was once a telemarketer.  Having said that out loud, I can tell you from experience that there is a law in place currently in the US and soon to be launched in Canada called the National Do-Not-Call List.      Just to clarify- most telemarketers are hooked into a computerized system that automatically dials your number from a list of names that are either A ) current clients of the company in question, B ) previous clients of the company in question, or C ) you signed up for something (possibly entered a contest or draw) where they take your name and information and sell lists in bulk to these companies for a profit.  Telemarketers have no way of knowing who you are and are not personally attacking you so PLEASE- instead of yelling at them or cursing and threatening or creating loud noises to hurt their ears (they are, after all, just doing their jobs, someone has to do it)... Just simply tell them to ""PUT ME ON THE DO NOT CALL LIST"" and BY LAW they are required to enter your name and phone number into a National Registry on the computer and NO TELEMARKETER can call you after that unless they feel like paying a hefty fine.  Keep in mind it takes 31 days to go into effect so you MAY get calls from the same company between the time you register and the time the computer recognizes your name and takes it out of the system. ALSO keep in mind that you should tell them if you have other numbers (I.E. Fax, cell, etc.. ) that you want put on the list. They are trained to ask you if there are any other numbers that you want added to the list but sometimes they forget (they are only human).  Anyway, once you've requested that all your numbers be added to the DNCL just sit back and wait, after about a month those pesky calls should stop coming in. You can find more information about this by going to https://www.donotcall.gov/default.aspx.  You can also register your numbers there.  Good luck!"

23906,irishfield,2007-01-18 20:46:00,26272,"Thanks Citty Kitty...appears to be USA based though. Won't take 705 area codes.  I'm currently putting a tape together..so I can call back ""Heather from Collingwood Escapes""... so she can listen to a taped message every day for over 2 months and the phone number for her to call back will be 1-800-eat-s...."
23907,~CK~,2007-01-18 20:48:00,30,LOL!! Good one..  On Topic- OP is your number listed or unlisted?
23908,Uncle Buck,2007-01-18 20:54:00,1000, Pete hit the nail on the head!!!!
23910,Roy,2007-01-18 21:05:00,13728,"Yeah, I like that too. A self-help group for thick seekers."
