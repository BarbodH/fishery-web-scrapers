I'm in Markham, just outside of Toronto.  I'd consider the Haliburtons but I don't know the area.  Fishing tribs is another option, but I've never tried it during the winter.  I don't need to know anyone's ""honey hole"", just a general area.  If you don't want to post it here, please PM me.  Thanks, Stan"
