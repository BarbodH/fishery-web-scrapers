24374,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-20 01:06:00,2585,its been cold enough up there that there is ice but the question is how thick is the ice?  THis years warm weather is going to be tough to judge the safety of the ice.  All the best and be safe out there!  I have fished sand in the summer before.  let me know how you make out if there is safe ice!  Cheers!
