Any info you can give me id appreciate.  -Fishnpro
24077,Bernie,2007-01-19 02:53:00,3190,There are approximately 8 inches of ice on Callander Bay. But not everywhere. The Wasi river runs into the bay and is a place to avoid. There are other areas on the bay that are known for having thin ice so caution MUST be taken. I dont fish Callander Bay so not too sure about where to fish..But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE leave your minnows at home. Dont spread the virus!!! There are bait dealers up here..!!!

The ""river"" is a different animal than the rest of the lake. I was on it last year in late Dec. / early Jan. and the ice in spots had me a little worried, even though it was plenty thick enough where we fished. We came across two open holes where there was no current."
24215,bassman,2007-01-19 13:49:00,384,"The report from West Nippising Resort this week is 4-5"" of ice. Stillnot thick enough for the huts, but may be OK for walking."
24216,trapshooter,2007-01-19 13:52:00,1234,"You can walk on from the town beach in Callander.  Walleye, pike, perch.  You'll see the huts to give you an idea of where to set up.  Leave your southern ontario bait in southern ontario!"
