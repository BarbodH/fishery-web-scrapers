7255,bpsbassman,2006-12-01 13:04:00,941,I looked on the new board and can't find his old handle.  Is he here under a different name? Has anybodyheard how his son Chris is doing?
7257,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-01 13:06:00,0,Was wondering the same thing Roger....
7280,just2manylures,2006-12-01 14:10:00,144,I hope all the old guys join up here.  Its a shame to lose people like speedtroll and spiltshot to name a few.  my 2 cents  2many
7364,irishfield,2006-12-01 17:49:00,26272,I've talked with him but not since the new board switch over. I was working on a flight relay to get his son up to Geary's lodge for ice out (without a lot of success). I think something else is in the works but I'm not a liberty to say.
7390,lew,2006-12-01 18:37:00,12767,"I talk to Rob a fair bit, but haven't heard from him in a little while now, but I think he's just more concerned with his son right now, rather than posting here. He'll be back when he's ready."
7391,ccmtcanada,2006-12-01 18:39:00,7971,Perfectly understandable why he hasn't been on the new board.  I probably wouldn't be either.
8194,bpsbassman,2006-12-04 14:45:00,941," I hear ya Lew, but if anybody is in touch with him, let him know that there are many of us here still thinking and praying for his son Chris."
24316,speedtroll,2007-01-19 19:56:00,52,"hello all  I haven't been around for a long time. Just spending as much time with the kids as possible   , while trying to keep the business afloat and the ex off my back.    (great life)  Just to give a quick update, we had a great christmas together. Chris was in good health. I took two weeks off and we had a blast. I got him a mini ATV (birthday/ christmas present) The kid is a natural (maniac).  However, two weeks ago he was rushed into the hospital with a bad blood infection and we have been there ever since. If they can't get a handle on it by the end of the weekend, they are going to take him down to Sick kids. This warm weather has just played havoc with a host of viruses floating around while his immune system is depressed. It looks like we are going to have to keep him out of school now which is going to be tough on him.  Anyway, thanks again for all the thoughts and prayers. I know it helps a lot. He is one tough little dude.  Take care Rob"
24317,Steve,2007-01-19 20:13:00,2075,"I know your busy right now, but thanks for taking the time to give us an update.  Try your best to be strong right now. You have a great son whose strength is unparalleled.  Take it easy my friend.  Steve"
24318,lew,2007-01-19 20:17:00,12767,"Hey Rob, if your in Toronto next week and need a shoulder, gimma a call bud."
24324,JFR,2007-01-19 21:24:00,498,"I know your family takes precident over some silly fishing board, but it was nice of you to take a minute and give us an update.  I hate to sound like I'm mimicking Lew, but if you what support or a strong shoulder, give me a PM before you leave.  I'll gladly share your burden.  You are in our prayers.  John"
24327,irishfield,2007-01-19 21:47:00,26272,"Same here Rob....  ...and if that far North Trip plan doesn't come together for the spring, I do know of a place in the Temagami Landscape where you and Chris are more than welcome to spend a weekend on me in the Spring.  Wayne"
24328,motv8tr,2007-01-19 21:49:00,2587,"Rob, thanks for the update, like you said, Chris is one tough little dude.  I'm glad you guys had a great Christmas.  Like the others said, if you need anything we'll be there for you.  I am in T.O. several times a week, even when I'm on vacation.  Maureen"
24447,Big Cliff,2007-01-20 11:37:00,6899,"I know you have a lot to contend with right now and really appreciate you taking the time to let us know what is going on. It really means a lot to so many of us who have been praying for you and Chris through all of this.  I never go to Toronto unless I really have to but if you ever needed me there...... well, you already know the answer.  We'll keep praying, keep us posted when you can."
24480,bpsbassman,2007-01-20 14:55:00,941,Glad to hear that you had a great Christmas with Chris. He (and you) are constantly in my prayers. Take care and let me know if there is anything that i can do.
