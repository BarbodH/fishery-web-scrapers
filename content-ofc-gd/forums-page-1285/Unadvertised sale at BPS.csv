Maureen,  Thought I’d let you and the OFNers know we’re having an unadvertised Store Clearance at our Vaughan (Toronto) location . . . this includes select Ice Fishing, Marine, Apparel and up to 40% on some Hunting Clothing items throughout the store. This is ongoing through to the 28th I believe. Have yourself a great weekend. Again, all the best at your event on the 24th.    Kind regards,  George Wallace  Canadian Market Manager"
