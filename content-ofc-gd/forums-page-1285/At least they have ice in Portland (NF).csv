24262,Joey,2007-01-19 16:42:00,9122,Check out this ice storm video.  A least they have ice  My Webpage
24263,ccmtcanada,2007-01-19 16:44:00,7971,"Saw this video yesterday Joey...unbelievable footage!  Couldn't help but laugh cause of the ""slow motion"" accidents!"
24269,wuchikubo,2007-01-19 17:12:00,1114,"Wow, that looks like a bad combo of strong winds, icy roads and no snow tires.  I hope nobody got too badly hurt.  HF"
24376,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-20 01:09:00,2585,lol the driver hit the gas in that video.  panicing always makes it worse!  CHeers!
24377,Gerritt,2007-01-20 01:14:00,6129,not fast and furious but neat to see... wow... seems odd seeing cars skating sideways like that...  thanks for sharing!  Ger.
24417,Garyv,2007-01-20 03:35:00,547,"Hills and Ice don't mix well to begin with.  Add drivers that are not used to these weather conditions, and don't have proper tires etc and it's a recipe for disaster.  Reminds me of some old business trips to Vancouver during the rare snow or ice storms there in the past."
24469,nautifish,2007-01-20 14:27:00,1416,I cannot beleive people were stupid enough to be even walking around down there.  ACTUALLY YEAH I CAN.
24502,Carp,2007-01-20 16:19:00,1488,WOW !!!  I guess the driver's just don't know enough to slow down. Shouldn't be on the roads at all in those conditions.
24585,Smokey,2007-01-20 20:26:00,1278,Good one Joey. Thanks
24595,lew,2007-01-20 20:54:00,12767,Unbelievable !!  Sorta looks like the DVP during a normal rush hour  ...........even without the ice
24596,BFSC Kevin,2007-01-20 20:56:00,1351,i dont see why there are people standing around on the streets and the person stepping on the gas?
24598,fishindevil,2007-01-20 21:07:00,6254,its neat when its in slow motion and all you are waiting for is the crunch.....  thanks joey
