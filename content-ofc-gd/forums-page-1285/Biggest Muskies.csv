You're a great guide on the water and a great guy off the water! Cheers, and hope you get onto some even bigger fish this year!  Stan"
22331,Darrell,2007-01-14 19:41:00,27,"Thanks everyone on the great feedback of the show. Upon talking with Aaron after they boated the second fish, he knew what the odds of that ever happening where let alone being caught on video, and was extatic that he would be able to share it with everyone. Being a fisherman and editor for the show I couldnt belive the footage that was handed to me. Like with all our shows what you see is what happend on that day reguardless of species, or in the case of ""Day of the Giants"" 30 mins out of 3 days fishing less some bleeps LOL. Thanks Darrell"
22384,Marty,2007-01-14 21:26:00,873,That was pure musky porn.  Way to go guys.  I watched it online and it was as good as TV.
22385,Daplumma,2007-01-14 21:30:00,1961,Where can I see it online?Dish dropped OLN a while back and I miss it! Joe

22421,lew,2007-01-14 22:41:00,12767,"Excellent show boyz !!!!  Anytime you can share a boat with Marc for a few days, you know your in for both fun times and a great learning experience !!"

22599,Marc Thorpe,2007-01-15 12:00:00,621,"Thanks all for the nice comments,for a couple of years now I've fished with Aaron on the Niagara for Steelhead and lakers,I was introduced to Aaron by a very close Friend Darren Goldenberg (Darsky) a few years ago on our very first trip out to Niagara.Steve Bedarf was the very first person I went to to revive the Lake Simcoe restoration project during my tenor as President of MCI,during our works together all 3 of us became very good friends . For those who dont realize how big Steve is,I could curl in a fetus position and fit in his belly All fun aside,both guys are great wonderfull people and whom better to share prob one of the best days ever filmed on Tv with,I would suspect the 2 biggest true measured muskies ever filmed,a unique moment in the history of Muskellunge fishing We all hear stories but these were true and both were not tail pinched as tail pinching is the legal method of measuring fish but in my perspective its an un-natural form and length added of approx 1 inch. Although I seldom girth fish unless I see a valid reason for this extra handling,I always do all my measurements in the water,it is the truest natural form of measuring fish in their natural state We have no idea what the weight was,I would suspect both were in the 40 pound range  Very glad everyone found it informative,Aaron and Darrel did a spectacular job and placing forth this info  Lew,Obessive ,compulsive behavior,thats why we do what we do  Mrs Eh,why I sound like I do,if you remember Drooppy in the cartoons of days long gone As Steve Bedarf would say ""I 'm Happy""  Those interested in reserving days,I have started taking reservations for 07 dates,first come first serve The show will be on Aaron site and my site along with many others I've done  Thanks to TJ and the Mods and all OFC'er's for allowing us to show you this and many other unique moments we experience throughout the season and years  Maybe we could see the Gillesp with Maina in action in the near Futur,ever see anyone jump like a little girl  Those who missed it http://www.gettinghooked.net/Episodes.htm  Be well marc"

21437,Roy,2007-01-11 18:56:00,13728,"This is gunna be a MUST watch on Sunday morning folks. If you want to see 3 professionals at work, tune in to OLN this Sunday morning January 14th at 8:30 then again at 10:30. The show is ""Getting Hooked"" with Aaron & Barry. If you're into muskies at all and fishing in general, you must not miss this one. I don't want to give away the plot here but there are 5 stars in the lineup. There's Aaron Shirley, Steve Bedarf, Marc Thorpe, Mrs. 57"" and her sister, Mrs. 58"".  Hope we can all get to see it. I'll bump this thread on Saturday night."
