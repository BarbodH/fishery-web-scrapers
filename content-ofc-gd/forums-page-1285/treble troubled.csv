24287,wkrp,2007-01-19 18:35:00,656,I am considering replacing the treble hooks on some of my musky baits to the red coloured type . Would this be worth my while or should I stick to the bronze type?. Iam not pleased with the saltwater hooks that came with the baits.
24293,lew,2007-01-19 18:53:00,12767,"I've never been sold on red hooks myself and If I get a bait with them, I replace them with Mustads.  Most of the larger red hooks I've seen always seemed to be very soft and of extremely poor quality, specially the ones on Suicks.  I use Mustads on all my musky baits, but it's just a personal preferrence and something that I know works well."

24298,Roy,2007-01-19 19:07:00,13728,I'll guess bronze.
24301,lew,2007-01-19 19:16:00,12767, Yup
24370,GbayGiant,2007-01-20 00:50:00,1780,"Mustad or VMC are what I use, I have the red hooks on a few lures haven't noticed them being any better or worse but I have'nt  really used the red hooks to much."
