24463,lew,2007-01-20 13:29:00,12767,"Anybody ever try these locks for your electronics ??  I know it'll only keep the honest thieves from grabbing your stuff, but it may deter them from trying if your boat is left unattended for awhile.  Saw them in the Cabelas catalouge for $17 each and thought somebody may be interested.  Pretty sad that we even have to think this way though, isn't it ??  "
24464,Pigeontroller,2007-01-20 13:49:00,2793,"I don't know about the locks Lew, but I have the Ram mount on my console unit and its great, brings the unit up and into a perfect location for viewing/using."
24466,Dondorfish,2007-01-20 13:50:00,1000,"Nope Lew - Don't do it. When I am on the boat ,  my Fishstrike 2000 is never more then 8' 1  1/2 "" from me ( 16' 3"" boat ). With the setup  in the picture there is still only 4 small screws holding it to the boat ( in the base ). They will  just yank the whole unit right out of the boat, screws and all, and will figure out how to remove the locks later. If you leave the boat - take it with you - or someone else will!   Don"
24472,lew,2007-01-20 14:32:00,12767," Thanks Don, and I agree with you,  I wasn't getting one myself but just saw it and thought someone may be interested.  And Dax, I picked up a Ram mount just the other day infact."
24473,Smokey,2007-01-20 14:35:00,1278,"I think if they want it the locks won't hold it, so your better to taking it off and locking in the boat when you have to.  I know its a pain but you'll probably have it longer if you keep it hidden."

24475,Carp,2007-01-20 14:41:00,1488,"I never leave my sonar/GPS unit in the boat, unless I'm within view. Even when renting cottages, I'll leave it in to eat lunch, but when I get in for the night, I park at the dock and take out sonar, tackle and rods and anything else that may grow legs and walk away.  The locks look pretty neat though. I'm sure they would help deter thieves and the cost is minimal compared to your Lowrance unit."
24476,Dondorfish,2007-01-20 14:41:00,1000,     Not a great picture of my mount - but you'll get the drift - works awsome - can be turned to be viewed at any position in the boat I consider it money well spent - and removes in a heartbeat.    Don
24477,lew,2007-01-20 14:42:00,12767," Proboat, a Ram mount is that upright piece in my picture that the GPS is sitting on.  It swivels at both ends and allows you to move your electronics into different positions."
24490,TAH,2007-01-20 15:34:00,133,thanks Tracker and Lew
