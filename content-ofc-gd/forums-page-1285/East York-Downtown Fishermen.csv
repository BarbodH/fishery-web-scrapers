Maybe we will run into each other down at Ashbridges bay or the Toronto Islands.  I try to get out as much as possible to these places, also the humber, Grenadier Pond, and Bluffers park.  Always looking for new fishing buddies.  Happy Fishing!"

We fished the Island for the first time 2 weekends ago while interested to get in with their residential lease agreements.  No fish, no property.   Perhaps one day I will give it another shot.
