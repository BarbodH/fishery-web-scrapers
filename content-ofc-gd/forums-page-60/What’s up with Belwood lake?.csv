1031208,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-15 23:02:00,720,"Hey guys, new to the board here. I hope to get some help as I can’t catch fish in the lake to save my life. I’ve tried targeting bass, pickerel and pike. I’ve been hitting this lake hard for the last 3 - 4 weeks with nearly everything in my kit.  Embarrassed to say only  ONE FISH!  HELP"
1031411,huzzsaba,2018-07-20 01:50:00,884,did you try live bait?
1031412,bigugli,2018-07-20 01:53:00,6138,Belwood can be a tough reservoir to figure out. Present water levels are well below the norm from accounts I've heard.
1031478,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-21 11:55:00,8243,"Might not be any fish left in this heavily fished smallish body of water. P.L.P. Population, location presentation."
1031487,Acountdeleted,2018-07-21 13:25:00,2562,"I’ve only had success in reservoirs like that when the water is at its highest. I find when it goes down, structure is tricky and fish are hard to target."
1031500,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-21 17:13:00,720,"That's what I have been trying to figure out. Where to look and when. I go to where I think they may be and then I find nothing. Or see Carp or catfish. I'm seeing this and not just in myself. Guys running around in beautiful 40k boats but with long faces. I'd not be happy either. Most guys at the launch saying they only caught a few if any. One guy a few weeks back reported a 1/2 doz each of smallies and eyes. If I see that guy again I should try hiring hi as a guide lol. I usually avoid it and try plastics, spoons and crank/jerk baits. Have tried worm harnesses but no luck as of yet (or this year at least)  I do see people getting perch or cats. Neither is my preferred however. If I thought the fish might be good eating, I'd look for perch, but the water quality of this lake is kind of gross looking (suspended algae or sediment) And thanks for your help guys. I'm going to keep working it. If nothing changes, I'll start focusing on Conestoga instead"
1031680,lureme,2018-07-25 13:25:00,21,"Oh Bellwood is still alive but because it's a reservoir  you have to be patient and versatile. Keep it simple and stick with the basics. Do you have any electronics? Maybe you need to hook up with me  to get some pointers, always like to share some ideas .   "
1031730,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-25 23:13:00,720,"Thanks for that, I just might take you up on that sometime. Any specific colours/patterns that seem to stand out?"
1031737,lureme,2018-07-26 01:43:00,21,"pumpkin seed and dark colored tube jigs, i/8th once tube sinkers to allow slow drop."
1031744,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-26 09:50:00,720,"Awesome, thanks! Hope to see you out there, I’m in a 70’s Starcracaft Supersport. White and blue with an equally antique merc on it"
1031772,spyder3g,2018-07-26 16:32:00,50,The best time to fish there is in the middle of September when the 70% of water from the reservoir is gonna be drained into Grand river. You do not even need a boat at that time. SM basses and pikes will attack your lures like crazy. You can see that on the lureme’s pictures (2nd and 3rd).
1031830,Rattletrap2,2018-07-27 20:19:00,1652,"Bellwood is a tough nut to crack for me too! We did okay last year for Pike opener, but during the summer, seems the fish are scarce. I know a guy with a cottage on the lake that swears the Walleye fishing is still good, but it mystifies me."
1031864,lureme,2018-07-28 04:16:00,21,Yoy have a 70's Star-craft ss? So do I ! mine has a 90 hp Evenrude and all the fishing stuff you need. We should hook up someday and look like a pair of twins on the water.
1031873,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-28 13:55:00,720,Oh cool! Are you the guy with the light green one? We’ll have to do that
1031893,lureme,2018-07-29 02:53:00,21,"+nope mine is exactly like yours, white with blue accents. I have a bimmy top swivel seats and electric trolling motor up front. I will be on the lake this Tues morning. I could give you my phone # and we could share some ideas and stuff if you like? My E mail address is       [email protected]"
