1029244,aplumma,2018-06-04 21:40:00,6896,The price of a raw material is incorporated in the end price. This is  either artificially dropped by a merchant accepting a lower profit margin or by streamlining the cost of producing an item. Both are bad for a business. A drop in profit is not acceptable because it is a cut in working capitol that the company needs. A streamlining is where hours and employee are cut back on or worst the benefits that previously enjoyed are cut or eliminated. To limit this type of slippery slope a tit for tat type of attitude should be avoided. The Governments will make up a limited list and this will go forward as to what tariffs we will impose/trade till both parties feel they have equally punished each other. The pendulum will swing the other way and return to status quo. A business that reacts and cuts orders and friendships that they have cultivated over the years will not be able to return to status quo when the correction occurs. If I were a merchant that sold across the border an explanation of what caused the price increase as well as a promise to not cut quality or timely product delivery would keep the business happy. The person who is hurt by the tariffs is the end product user who has no one to pass the cost on to. Art
1029245,craigdritchie,2018-06-04 22:10:00,1586,"Bingo. The problem with reporting on this issue is that it consistently ignores the fact that the Canadian and US economies are completely and totally integrated. Everyone talks about a 10% tariff on aluminum. Consider this ... A mining company in Canada digs up some raw ore and sells it to a smelter/refiner in the States. It crosses the border - boom, tack on 10%. The smelter will pay it. The smelter in the US turns that rock into aluminum bars. They're sold to a company in Canada that makes boat equipment like cleats, hinges, windshield frames or whatever. The stuff crosses the border. Tack on a second 10%. The component manufacturer will pay it. Aluminum bar gets turned into a boat cleat, and sold to Boston Whaler. Back it goes across the border to the Boston Whaler factory, where en route it gets taxed yet again - 10% for the third time. Boston Whaler will pay it. Boston Whaler makes a boat, and sells it to a dealer in Canada. Guess what? That's right, another trip across the border and another 10%. Dealer marks up the boat accordingly. Before it even gets to the dealer showroom, that aluminum cleat has been taxed and tariffed four times. You, the guy who buys the boat, ultimately pay for it all. Sound ridiculous? Perhaps. But that scenario is very real, it's not an exaggeration at all. And it applies to all sorts of things that we buy. If you think a boat is complex, try keeping track of all the components in a car. The big issue with these tariffs is that it's not necessarily just a simple 10% price increase. In some cases, because of the way manufacturing works in North America, the surcharges will be much, much higher than that."

1029088,craigdritchie,2018-06-01 12:35:00,1586,"I think most people are aware that Trump has went ahead and imposed new tariffs on steel and aluminum that's exported from Canada into the US. I think most also know that in retaliation, Canada has outlined something like $16 billion on tariffs on various products coming into Canada from the US. The official list of products specifically includes boats, both aluminum and fibreglass. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT BUYING AN AMERICAN-MADE BOAT, you better get on your horse and do it asap. Effective July 1, those new Canadian tariffs come into effect and the cost of your boat will go up by 10 percent. Beyond that, the cost for dealers to replace inventory that's on their lot today will also go up by an additional 10 percent (at a minimum) since boat builders in the US are now paying 10 percent more for the aluminum they import from Canada. The net result is that the retail price of US-made boats sold in Canada could increase by 20 to 25 percent by mid-summer. Barring a sudden flip-flop by Trump,  or a deal on NAFTA, boats and engines are going to become much more expensive. If you're in the market, do the deal now before the new taxes come into effect and save yourself some serious coin."

Marine engines are not specifically identified in the tariff list but there is a line that mentions ""other miscellaneous products"" that are made primarily out of aluminum.
