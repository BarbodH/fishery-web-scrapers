1031610,riddickulous,2018-07-23 19:29:00,27,Ridiculous. That's like having toilet paper with the directions written on it.
1031613,mamona,2018-07-23 19:48:00,597,Here is the full list of winners this year http://www.wideopenspaces.com/icast-2018-new-product-showcase-award-winners/
1031620,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-24 02:56:00,937,Thanks
1031646,Lape0019,2018-07-24 16:37:00,647,Youll have one in no time then lol. I have a Metanium DC. I like it but don’t notice any gains in casting. My wife who is a newb to baitcasters absolutely loves it though.
1031650,Snidley,2018-07-24 18:13:00,620,"I know that Tackle Tour always felt the biggest advantage to DC reels was that you got max distance as well as accuracy without extreme casting effort. This would probably save the occasional cast off. Those DC Curado's will be $349 in canada I'm told. Cheaper but not cheap by any means. SAW A NEW CANADIAN COMPANY DOING A HIGH END CRANK, STICK, JIG AND DROP SHOT MINNOW AT ICAST . https://www.nishinelureworks.com/collections/nishine-lure-works-jerkbait/products/jerkbait-erie-115md-alewife-chrome That stickbait looks like a fancy Ripplin' Redfin which is not a bad thing. The crank looks nice too. If I see them out and about I would buy one."
1031661,LittleWorm,2018-07-24 22:26:00,122,That Hollow Body Craw looks amazing!
1031014,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-11 22:02:00,937,Anyone following it? See anything you like? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUL9d_vSte4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9klOJZLCCnU I wanna try the new Shimano Curado DC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd8qsbdJnPQ    The new Livetarget Hollow Body Craw looks interesting https://youtu.be/EE174byBGhc     
1031015,misfish,2018-07-11 22:07:00,29133,"JP . Nice to see ya. Ditch creek fishing. LMAO, That was funny. When will they come out with a float reel? "
1031016,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-11 22:25:00,937,"Thanks, I was having a hard time with the links. Before they would just pop up but they weren't doing that for me today"
1031017,misfish,2018-07-11 22:32:00,29133,No worries. Always willing to help a brother out pump.
1031018,kickingfrog,2018-07-11 23:57:00,8333,"I thought maybe I could swing something and go, but my contact is in Vegas on vacation."
1031085,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-12 20:33:00,937,I want this 
1031086,misfish,2018-07-12 20:41:00,29133,I want this  
1031109,AKRISONER,2018-07-13 11:08:00,5558,Zoom's TRD Craw is by far the best thing I have seen so far. The only company making realistic craws at this point was OSP and they were charging $20 + a pack.
1031116,mamona,2018-07-13 13:35:00,597,"Yeah, Pelican is probably the cheapest pedal drive. I love Hobie's Guardian Shield  "
1031130,Snidley,2018-07-13 20:48:00,620,They lifted the Hobie drive almost unchanged since patent protection is done. Overall it's probably a much cheaper option since Pelican is made here and Hobie is made stateside. The price of the Hobie's has reached ridiculous levels. The Hobies are also heavy making it a pain to hoist them up on to your cartop. This one is 85lbs so it's reletively easy to get them up. The only problem I see is that they look cheap and that somtimes indicates that they are poorly made. I expect to see them at Sail soon. I read it's $1495 USD which is cheap compared to the Hobie and other like driven kayaks. It will be interesting to know if they copied the old Mirage Drive with bushings or the new Mirage drive that uses berrings
1031131,misfish,2018-07-13 21:31:00,29133,I have a question. Can one buy the pedal drive separate? I'm sure I could made a bracket on my toon to set one up. That would be cool.
1031132,mamona,2018-07-13 21:36:00,597,"Sure you can, it's ~$1000 I think ?"
1031133,misfish,2018-07-13 21:43:00,29133,So why are not selling the yaks for $200-$400 then ? LOL
1031134,Terry,2018-07-13 21:48:00,14456,"US bucks so thats 10,000.00 CND"
1031140,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-14 03:11:00,8243,I want it all. When I win the big Lotto I will get you that barge Brian. I promise and a promise from me is a signed contract. I'll get you other guys those lures.
1031148,woodenboater,2018-07-14 15:12:00,2277,"If the Shimano DC really works, imma gonna drop some coin and get one. Not that I don't love picking at nests lol"
1031155,misfish,2018-07-14 18:12:00,29133,"Since when does a reel need to have a computer in it?. This is what I call STUPID CRAZY, OVER THINKING c hit. Improve the basics, no issue here. Maybe they are caught up in today's world. Make it simple stupid."
1031156,woodenboater,2018-07-14 18:17:00,2277,"yup. learning how to throw with a baitcaster is fundamental but that doesn't mean we can't adapt or use newer tech. I'm happy to see a company that's doing more than just keeping on, keeping on"
1031157,misfish,2018-07-14 18:31:00,29133,"I guess if you have the coin to ADAPT, then all the power to ya. I wonder how many more fish it will catch?"
1031158,woodenboater,2018-07-14 18:32:00,2277,"with my luck, not much. but it would make for a more efficient lure washer lolol"
1031159,misfish,2018-07-14 18:38:00,29133,LOL
1031163,OhioFisherman,2018-07-15 00:00:00,6623,"Pssst, you need a 250hp motor to catch fish! LOL"
1031202,BillM,2018-07-15 20:55:00,17367,Shimano has been making 'DC' reels for a long time.  This one is just affordable
1031418,riddickulous,2018-07-20 03:15:00,27,The new Hobie has reverse so Pelican is copying the earlier version of the hobie mirage drive. There are lots of pedal style kayaks coming out in iCast. It is good to have some competition. Hobie really is over priced.
1031507,mamona,2018-07-21 18:09:00,597,"RTD, Rod Threading Device, so cool   "
