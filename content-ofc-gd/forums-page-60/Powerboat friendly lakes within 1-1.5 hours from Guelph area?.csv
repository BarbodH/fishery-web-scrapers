1031257,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-16 23:54:00,720,"Hey guys, looking for suggestions on powerboat friendly lakes or rivers in the Southwest or central Ontario. Sorry, let’s add “productive” to that list. I’m a novice boater with only a 16’ aluminum bow rider (with a flinstones era motor) so big water is not great idea for me. I’m adding a 9.9 hp kicker so small lakes with 9.9 restrictions might work too. Prefer a  1-1.5 hour drive from Guelph or Fergus area  Thanks in advance "
1031258,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-17 00:20:00,8243,Google map how far Dunnville is from you. Fish the Grand from the bridge to Lake Erie .
1031259,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-17 00:28:00,720,"Thank you, that’s a spot I have considered and it’s within range."
1031283,Woodsman,2018-07-17 13:41:00,1286,Adding a kicker may not help on restricted lakes unless you remove the larger motor. Wildwood just outside of St. Marys may fit you requirements but it gets to be quite busy on the weekend afternoons with water skiers and wake boarders.
1031289,lunkerbasshunter,2018-07-17 16:06:00,2585,"erie, Ontario,  Grand river at the mouth of Erie.  Simcoe (maybe pushing 1.5hours). Lake Eugenia? GBAY on the south end?  Good luck"
1031334,grimsbylander,2018-07-18 16:10:00,3016,"Sure it will. Just leaves the keys to the big motor in the truck and you're fine. I have fished and know lots of guys that fish Guelph Lake(no gas motors) with bass boats that have 250's hanging off them. Just run the electric, trim up the big motor and don't have the keys handy."
1031345,porkpie,2018-07-18 21:12:00,2521,You don't even need to leave the keys to the big motor in the truck.  Just don't run the big motor and your golden! .
1031347,grimsbylander,2018-07-18 23:11:00,3016,Yeah I know but since I can't control who reads these posts I thought I'd say that to remove their temptations! Lol
1031353,Woodsman,2018-07-19 03:37:00,1286,"Guys there are some lakes you will not get on period if a motor over the limits is on the boat. ""I won't run it"" doesn't cut it as the've heard that before only to get burned. Don't assume you can without at least confirming it with the controlling authorities for the particular lake."
1031362,grimsbylander,2018-07-19 12:33:00,3016,What lakes?
1031409,Woodsman,2018-07-20 01:26:00,1286,When I worked for Upper Thames Conservation (years ago) on Fanshawe if the motor was there forget it. All I said was confirm it's OK before assuming. A day would be spoiled if they were turned away because they thought it was OK to find out differently.
1031479,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-21 12:01:00,720,Thanks for the ideas guys. True that Guelph lake works by honour system (doesn’t make you take them off)
1031683,lureme,2018-07-25 13:48:00,21,"Try Bellwood lake motor boats welcome. But if you really want some hot action for large smallies try Lake Erie out of Cristle beach area . You do not need to go off shore far at all, just fish the shoal's and rock ledges. "
1031688,Acountdeleted,2018-07-25 14:14:00,2562,"If you can leave the big motor at home and slap on a trolling motor, I'd go to Island Lake in orangeville. I love that body of water. Enough spots and species to keep anyone busy for a day. I'd also consider Goderich at the mouth of the Thames. (I think its the thames?)"
1031708,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-25 16:19:00,720,"Thanks, I think that is the MAitland I hadn’t considered Orangeville"
1031753,Woodsman,2018-07-26 12:22:00,1286,Goderich is on the Maitland River. Not much river to boat in though and if the lake is rough you are quite limited for space.
1031907,Rattletrap2,2018-07-29 14:04:00,1652,Island Lake in Orangeville will let you on with the big motor still attached. Just trim it up and use electric only. 
1031922,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-29 21:19:00,720,Great to know. I’d like to check it out. Need to pick up a bigger transom mount elec troller or fix my front mount 50lb
1031927,Acountdeleted,2018-07-30 01:51:00,2562,I did not know that. Good to know. I honestly love island lake. It’s big enough to find lots of hidden spots without being in peoples back pockets.
