1031263,SirCranksalot,2018-07-17 01:44:00,3291,"  These seem to be all over the net. Why so popular? I see anything too special about the jigs apart from the barbs. Does the shape of the jighead---more or less spherical like a normal jig, or more like a hemisphere as these are---really make much diff? I can see the point of the  NED rig in letting one end of a Senko worm, or similar, sit in the bottom. The other similar rig I've seen has a special screw(no doubt at a special price if you'll excuse my cynicism) inserted into one end of a Senko, again to let one end sit on the bottom.  Have any of you tried these? Comments?   https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/z-man-finesse-shroomz-jigheadz  "
1031265,David Chong,2018-07-17 02:10:00,836,"The Ned Rig is not just half a Senko on a jighead. The Ned Rig involves a Z-Man TRD bait which is made of ElaZtech which is extremely buoyant, soft & supple. Rigged on a ShroomZ jighead this property enables the bait to stand straight up and quiver off the bottom.  Watch this video and you'll see the difference! https://zmanfishing.com/cms/zman_tv.php"
1031269,OhioFisherman,2018-07-17 03:18:00,6623,"David, I seem to recall that some years back they came out with a floating plastic that wasn't compatible with other types of plastics? Same stuff?"
1031270,OhioFisherman,2018-07-17 03:23:00,6623,"Sir, I used these for a long time, not weedless though. http://www.gophertackle.com/mushroomjig.html"
1031273,David Chong,2018-07-17 11:34:00,836,"Similar, if not the same! You definitely don't want to mix an ElaZtech plastics with any other type of plastic. You also don't want to put them in a Plano-type box, just keep them in the original package. Don't put a used one back in either but they last so long, not sure why you would have to. LOL I sort my Z-Man plastics in Bass Mafia Money Bags, one for my dropshot baits, one for my punch baits, etc."
1031275,msp,2018-07-17 12:02:00,1336,"I started experimenting with the Ned rid this season. As mentioned above, the original Z mans TRD performs much better than half a senko or dinger due to its buoyancy. I have had moderate success on highly pressured fish or during post front finicky fish. I have been using a medium light rod with 10 pound braid with a 10 pound flouro leader. The light jig head provides a super slow fall fish cant resist. Works well in my opinion."
1031278,AKRISONER,2018-07-17 13:00:00,5558,"Z man came out with a craw specifcally made for the ned at ICAST, it looks friggin incredible for smallies."
1031279,SirCranksalot,2018-07-17 13:03:00,3291,"thx, guys-I'll need to do a bit more watching and reading. I think it was the the screws I saw used with Senkos."
1031282,AKRISONER,2018-07-17 13:06:00,5558,you are thinking of the Neko Rig then.  That involes a nail weight with basically a senko whacky rigged.  
1031286,OhioFisherman,2018-07-17 14:38:00,6623,"What's old is new again! Ya, as I recall that was the issue, I remember craw tubes too, they looked like a crayfish. I started fishing area bass tournaments in the 70's and I used and saw a lot of other guys throwing soft plastics on light jigheads, they could still be productive when I had to stop fishing."
1031417,riddickulous,2018-07-20 02:58:00,27,"Why special? It's because sometimes finesse fishing works best when the bite is off. Its a combination of a do-nothing baits like senkos + small plastic on jig + shakeyhead. The difference with a special ned jig is that it's 1) light, like 1/15 oz or even lighter and 2) thin gauge and large (for the weight) hook for rigging 3 inch baits. I've tried this year on a tough bite and it got me fish when other techniques weren't working. I tried with a senko, but the Z man plastics that float are supposed to make a big difference. Those new iCAST TRD CrawZ look amazing."
1031523,bobowski,2018-07-22 03:15:00,360,Anyone know if Bass Pro or Cabelas stock these baits?
1031524,OhioFisherman,2018-07-22 03:52:00,6623,the bass pro in vaughan shows them.
1031526,Chuck Enwinde,2018-07-22 11:41:00,247,Sail carries them if you don't find what you're looking for at BPS.
1031527,singingdog,2018-07-22 11:53:00,1047,"I wasn't prepared to buy into the ned rig mania, but have become a bit of a convert. Does it outfish 1/2 a senko on any decent jighead? Only if you are fishing it on the bottom, which I rarely do. The big benefit to the Zman plastics is the durability: 20+ fish on one plastic is common if you do a good jog of glueing on the plastic. That makes a huge difference when the rockbass are trying to pull the plastic off of every jig you throw in the water. I prefer other jigheads to the gopher head, but it's tough to find quality hooks on such light heads. I rarely use the TRD, prefer the hula sticks. I mainly use it as a slow mid-column presentation, or as a river presentation. It catches fish, and not just bass. On a couple of local rivers, I routinely go out with nothing but ned rigs: rainbows, 'eyes, smallies, carp, and musky (biteoffs) all fall for it. This spring, it was one of my best 'eye lures, outfishing any hand-tied jig I tried. Fall smallies: best thing I have ever tried, which is hard to say since I love tieing and fishing hare/hair jigs."
1031534,bobowski,2018-07-22 14:25:00,360, Thanks guys
1031553,Dutch01,2018-07-22 18:34:00,1431,Solely Outdoors in the old LeBaron location in Markham also carries Zman.
1031609,riddickulous,2018-07-23 19:27:00,27,Can be found also on Amazon (price not so good but convenient). Locally - Gagnons is a good place to go.
1031619,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-24 02:55:00,937,I've experienced Elaztech melting my other platics before but what happens when you put a used one back in the original bag? I have a bunch of Elaztech plastics but I haven't used them much.
1032295,Old Ironmaker,2018-08-06 23:10:00,8243,Looks familiar to something we used in the late 70's. A do nothing jig that worked great for Northerns believe it or not. We lost many a jig and fish because they did not work on one of those 2 ton steel cables called leaders back then. We experienced a glob of plastics in the trays of our Steel and Aluminum tackle boxes. They could melt the compartments right through. What a mess you would find in the spring.
