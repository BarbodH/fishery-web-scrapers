1031684,Raycaster,2018-07-25 13:52:00,528,"Got back from Lake St. Clair and launching from Jeanettes Creek finally pushed me to think of improving my boat trailer as I'm tired of getting wet and struggling in low water launches. I have a pontoon boat and built my retrofitted tandem trailer for the boat with great success (or so it seemed). Basically I need a ""CLIFF"" boat launch for smooth launches as the boat sits high on the trailer. I could adjust the bunk brackets down maybe 2"" but I think the simple solution is a 6' extension just used for launches, not travel. My idea was a simple 6' 2"" square tube with 6"" doubled up for ball height and the peg holes drilled in the other end for the truck receiver. THIS IS NOT A TRAVEL HITCH, JUST USED FOR LAUNCHES. I have read that it will put a lot stress on hitches but mines pretty solid. Probably a hassle on and off but way better then having the truck 3/4 into each lake! Under $100 for metal at Princess Auto I think, will have to look around. "
1031699,DanD,2018-07-25 15:15:00,2223,Like you said there will be a lot of stress on the extension bar at the trucks receiver. I'm thinking if you were to put a joint in the bar; which will allow the bar to move up and down. That should take care of the possible bending of the bar at the receiver end.  Dan. 
1031706,Raycaster,2018-07-25 16:13:00,528,"Like the way you think DanD, I will give that some thought."
1031711,DanD,2018-07-25 17:18:00,2223,Here's another thought. Not sure if my crappy diagram will make any sense? But I think this design would likely hook up a lot easier and relieve some of the stress on the bar? 
1031715,Terry,2018-07-25 17:54:00,14456,Are you driving it onto the trailer you may need to beef it up more. But if you are whinching it on I think it should be ok
1031728,misfish,2018-07-25 22:05:00,29133,"Why not make a retractable sleeve over your existing trailer tongue? Your only talking 6"" Those heavy duty locking pins will hold for towing as well. No dif then a swing hitch. "
1031731,Fisherman,2018-07-25 23:37:00,7201,"Nooo, he said 6 feet. "
1031732,misfish,2018-07-25 23:39:00,29133,"Me bad My idea was a simple 6' 2"" square tube with 6"" doubled up for ball height and the peg holes drilled in the other end for the truck receiver."
1031733,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-26 00:16:00,720,Suggest a heavy wall tube. Stronger to use 2.5” tube with 2” stub into your receiver.  How much tongue weight?
1031734,Fisherman,2018-07-26 00:38:00,7201,"But, he want's a quick detach item so he can still tow with the original setup.  DanD's setup will work, very quick and simple."
1031738,wdodgetruck,2018-07-26 02:12:00,27,You can buy your steel a lot  cheaper at a local steel supplier  than princess auto.
1031758,Raycaster,2018-07-26 13:17:00,528,How about this? I can leave my hitch on this way and have 2 swivel points. Those ball clamps hold pretty tight right? No chance if disengaging if locked? 
1031762,DanD,2018-07-26 13:47:00,2223,"With two pivot points, it will be very difficult to back that rig up. Not impossible; but everything you've learned about backing up a trailer will be backwards. Dan"
1031763,Terry,2018-07-26 13:58:00,14456,You will never back it down with 2 pivot points 
1031766,Fisherman,2018-07-26 15:29:00,7201,"Nope, the rear attachment would likely drop to the ground, has to have the rear point stay up, you need that pin connection DadD originally posted."
1031767,Raycaster,2018-07-26 15:29:00,528,"Yup, your right, 1 pivot is good."
1031807,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-27 00:26:00,720,Like pushing a rope
1031914,Fisherman,2018-07-29 16:48:00,7201,Only if it's frozen and pointing down.
1031921,John Bacon,2018-07-29 21:19:00,3277,"Wouldn't that cause the trailer tongue to sit on the ground?  I think that he needs a rigid bar to hold the tongue off the ground. If he added a pivot then I think he would also need to add a wheel to suppor the tongue.  The trailer jack may work, but their wheels are usually pretty small. "
1032016,wkrp,2018-07-31 20:28:00,656,Try Metal Supermarket. A lot cheaper than the Princess
1032022,Hack_Fisherman,2018-07-31 22:22:00,720,Most welding shops will sell off cuts for cash. Even better deal ?
