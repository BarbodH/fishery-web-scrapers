The kids are the children of an extended family that have been coming to the camp for 30 years, really nice clan. A real pleasure to take these guys out and see how much they enjoyed our adventure, been a while since I've sat in a tinner back trolling, gonna have to do more of it...pretty fun. Kid's all got on some nice fish, we had shore lunch and a swim and got home by 6pm, exhausted but full of stories, and of course they have a nice video they can show their kids.  "
