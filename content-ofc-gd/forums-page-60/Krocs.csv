1031595,AKRISONER,2018-07-23 16:32:00,5558,"i think you did it colin, you found the one pair of footwear in the world that is as hideous as my crocs"
1031599,BassMan11,2018-07-23 18:02:00,583,"Big fan of them - Garage Crocs - Boat Crocs - Back door Crocs - Camping Crocs Although I will say, getting them wet with bare feet and then trying to walk is a nightmare."
1031601,colin519,2018-07-23 18:21:00,101," hahaha yup i didn't say they were fashionable, just functional. i got into some camping/canoing gear a few years ago after doing a few portages and some pieces of gear just stick with ya. I use the water shoes with my hiking boots https://www.scarpa.com/kailash-gtx when back packing. some people use the trail shoe, some sandals, crocs. i like to have boots to deal with mud and carrying a boat and swimming/camping/boating/fishing are perfect for the water shoe. i don't think i could carry a boat over an obstacle in a croc but the watershoes are fine. inow i can see fishing in crocs but i'd want them in realtree or hunters orange so everyone knew they were chosen on their technical merits. "
1031616,crappieperchhunter,2018-07-23 21:26:00,2582,Have a pair of these at the cottage for everyone in my family. You only have to step on a zebra mussel once while swimming  to understand why.
1032167,JoshS,2018-08-03 15:24:00,729,"Funny post! Crocs are the best shoes ever invented IMO. My wife hates that I wear them everywhere lol.  In my opinion all spring/summer casual footwear should be the same material! Nothing beats the breathability other than no shoes at all, the comfort and that you can run them under the sink for a quick clean and they dry in 5 mins. The first pair I had ($5 knockoffs) lasted me 10 years -I thought they'd never die and used to preach to my city counterparts that they're the shoes that last 100 years and everyone should wear them, who cares what they look like - until I wore through the big toe area on the sole from putting 100000 miles on them. I like the softer plastic knockoffs more as I can control my TM speed easier through the shoe. Best shoes ever invented. I generally wear them from the first spring trip until mid fall, colder days just add merino socks. I really like moosebunks idea of neoprene socks for a rain shoe!"
1032238,Boyd,2018-08-05 13:08:00,16,"Never had a pair, never will, buddy had them for years and aching knees. Told him about DAWGS which you can get in Canada and he got a pair. Knees are still a little grumpy but he has noticed a vast improvement. They have lots of styles and colours for all family members, (golfers too lol ).  Wife has six pairs for around the house, garden and even work. Check it out."

1032386,Rattletrap2,2018-08-09 02:47:00,1652,"Well, I have to admit that I have several pair. I'm sportin the camo versions right now! I have two pairs of these. They work great for getting in the water at boat ramps. No problem with wet grass either. Love 'em!"
1032388,_al87_outdoors,2018-08-09 03:06:00,22,"As a lady angler, my opinion crocs were once a horrible fashion but they have excellent purpose. Lightweight, dry quick, come in many styles now... mine are a boat shoe and supposedly they are excellent for your back and stability ... can’t go wrong in my opinion ?"
1032395,OhioFisherman,2018-08-09 14:00:00,6623,If you like them it may pay to stock up? There could be changes coming? https://fox8.com/2018/08/09/crocs-closing-last-of-manufacturing-facilities-ceo-resigning/
1032399,AKRISONER,2018-08-09 15:06:00,5558,I think they are struggling to compete with the knock offs now available everywhere.  Their price point wasnt too friendly when you can grab a pair from the dollar store.
1032400,OhioFisherman,2018-08-09 15:28:00,6623,"Walmart velcro fasten track shoes and walmart flip flops were always good enough for me, I did buy decent work shoes and boots because at times I chose pounding the concrete dock for 10 hours over being stuck in a truck for up to 15 hours. LOL, I save a lot of money these days on shoes, I don't wear them!"
1032405,jimmer,2018-08-09 16:28:00,2730,I bought a pair of Birkenstock all plastic sandals and they are great.  A little more expensive than the knock off crocs though.
1032415,Sterling,2018-08-09 20:00:00,477,Love me some crocs. Saw my dad snowblowing the driveway in -10 weather in crocs once. He loves them too.
1032457,Sinker,2018-08-10 14:22:00,8692,I wear mine all winter too. A nice pair of merino wool socks and I'm good to go! Not so great in slush though...lol  S.
1032460,AKRISONER,2018-08-10 14:50:00,5558,lmao this is epic.
1032464,dave524,2018-08-10 16:12:00,4508,I swap the crocs for duck shoes for taking out the trash and letting the dogs out in winter.
1031126,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-13 18:49:00,8243,"A great way to turn an ankle, no support and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'll stop there. When I get new runners I would cut the heel out of the old ones then turned an ankle bad. I've sprained my weak ankles wearing steel toe work boots laced to the top let alone those abominations called footwear. I have a pal that is extremely homophobic, bad way to think, I told him they were popular amongst those that he doesn't understand, he threw all 3 pair out including the camo pair. There is another fishing forum in Ontario the only way to get booted is to admit wearing those things and Copyright infringement whatever that is."
1031128,KawarthaAngler,2018-07-13 20:18:00,273,I got on sale for 50% off the Canadian Tire Outbound Shore Sandal.  They are great.  They are the same as the Croc Sandal and Shimano Sandal. I use them for boating so that I can easily jump in the water if needed and not care. I've fished all day tourny's in these and they have been comfortable.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/outbound-shore-sandal-black-green-men-s-1870285p.html#srp
1031129,bigugli,2018-07-13 20:36:00,6138,There's only one tyrue Canadian outdoor shoe. It is called a mocassin.

1031136,aplumma,2018-07-13 23:47:00,6896,No Crocs in my world. A good pair of tennis shoes for traction and support. If I am fishing I am usually barefoot since the deck on the boat is carpet. Boots are used when running equipment on the farm or riding the motorcycles. Art
1031137,grimsbylander,2018-07-14 00:29:00,3016,There's holes in those wellies! lol
1031138,Old Ironmaker,2018-07-14 02:58:00,8243,"Any boaters and fishermen out here that have heard of Deck Shoes. I have a few pair. Great support, comfort, traction and water resistant. None come in Camo and none made in Vietnam. You won't find a good pair at Giant Tiger or Wally World. My wife and her sisters call Giant Tiger GT Boutique. Many of my T shirts, jammies, underwear, socks, wooly hats, jackets, hoodies, watches, gloves, KD, eggs, butter, canned corn and sweats to name a few garments and stuff come from there, I'm no fashion or foodie snob. If you like Krocs God bless you, you aren't getting in my boat though. And don't think you are sneaking them onboard. I check for contraband, booze and footwear."
1031141,OhioFisherman,2018-07-14 03:18:00,6623,"I haven't worn more than flip flops in about 8 years and the last time I wore those was about 3 years ago for a trip to the emergency room. LOL, never did crocs, velcro fasten track shoe from wally world or flip flops, work shoes or boots when I was working."
1031143,chris.brock,2018-07-14 03:22:00,4053,"We're getting off topic with GT Boutique etc, but my wife and I recently wandered into Jackson's Square in the Hammer, that was my first experience with Hart Stores, I didn't have a lot of time, but it was pretty cool, Huk fishing shirts for $10 etc. I've got a lot of different kinds, but my favorite summer time, slip on shoes, no socks, are Sanuks. They're good for nothing, get sweaty and stinky but I love the things.   "
1031146,Garnet,2018-07-14 13:44:00,2056,Crocs Slip on! Don't get stones in them! Can walk in water! And I'm not cool!
1031147,Fisherman,2018-07-14 14:53:00,7201,I only wear them for launch and retrieving the boat.
1031150,Moosebunk,2018-07-14 15:57:00,3970,"They're great for having in the boat for sure. Do like them with a pair of neoprene socks on trips.  Crocs and neoprene socks are instant, dry rubber boots. They pack super light or can be kept tucked in the boat. Big downpours they become part of the rain suit. Portaging through muck and mire they're handy too."
1031153,Sinker,2018-07-14 17:26:00,8692,I love my crocs. I wear them with socks just to piss off the haters. I wear them EVERYWHERE all year long.  No shame at all. S. 
1031172,Beans,2018-07-15 15:00:00,3339,I wear mine without socks around the house all the time...I find them much cooler than slippers...My foot doctor recommended that I wear socks with them while outdoors as I am diabetic ( same with my running shoes)
1031183,pics,2018-07-15 16:50:00,1268,"Got a pair for the shower at work but they aren't good for traction.. I also have a pair for launching the boat.. Not real ones, just the cheap knock offs.."
1031212,Tim Mills,2018-07-16 10:59:00,476,I just replaced a pair  of croc flip flops I had for around 15yrs. I 've had  regular crocs too. Good for hard work and camp shoes on canoe trips.
1031225,SirCranksalot,2018-07-16 15:37:00,3291,Good until  you slip on a wet rock and go A over teakettle!!

1031312,206,2018-07-18 01:33:00,563,on my 3rd pair of the original crocs skutes...Anyone have a pair of these in M13 or M14 I will pay more than top dollar for them!!! they quit making them years ago

1031081,jimmer,2018-07-12 19:52:00,2730,I saw Old Iron slightly rant on another post about someone wearing krocs and I was just wondering how many guys on this forum wear them? It would interesting to know.
1031082,Garnet,2018-07-12 19:54:00,2056,I wear crocs.An who cares what Iron said says does do's they are great.
1031083,crappieperchhunter,2018-07-12 20:27:00,2582,Have 2 pairs. Love them for wearing around the cottage in the summer. Also have a pair at the front door at home that are my slip on something quick to go get the mail or take the garbage out shoes. However they are downright dangerous if you have wet feet or your walking on ground with a steep grade. 
1031084,PUMP KNOWS,2018-07-12 20:29:00,937,How about these joints?

1031094,glen,2018-07-12 23:03:00,2641,Just as a quick slip on to go on the deck or ioutside for a minute.  Launching when I need to go in the water.  But running shoes go on for in the boat because I like the traction.
1031095,moose,2018-07-12 23:35:00,266,if I could wear at work I would wear all yr 
1031096,bigugli,2018-07-13 00:08:00,6138,Definitely not a shoe for farmers

1031099,SirCranksalot,2018-07-13 01:45:00,3291,"Ha---a side benefit!!?I wear them at the beach---not too much chance of slipping there. Also on pavement. They are treacherous anywhere slipping is a prob  deck of a boat, rough terrain. "

1031104,smitty55,2018-07-13 02:50:00,928,I had to laugh at that one.  You might be surprised. I went and picked up some eggs at the farm down the road at 6:15 this evening. Two pairs of real dirty crocs at the door. I see them there all the time. Easy to hose off. I don't think they wear them at milking time though.  Cheers
1031106,bigugli,2018-07-13 09:34:00,6138,My buddy used to wear them while watering down the rows of tomatoes. That was until he did a 2 and a 1/2 gainer with a twist after hitting a patch of greasy mud. No traction at all
1031107,Garnet,2018-07-13 10:11:00,2056,When new Crocs have great traction. Only cheapos keep wearing them when the treads get wore down.  New pair every year.
1031108,AKRISONER,2018-07-13 10:53:00,5558,"hate to say it folks, but they are the best damn fishing shoes you can buy. I dont wear them much outside of the house because yes, they shouldnt be worn anywhere in public...i still somehow manage to find myself wearing them more than i should because they are so comfy and easy to put on. mine are real tree HD as well lmaooo  Drives the GF absolutely nuts"
1031110,grimsbylander,2018-07-13 12:16:00,3016,Never had a pair. A record I intend to keep intact.
1031114,John,2018-07-13 13:12:00,2956,Crocs are awesome. Have a pair outside the front side and back doors of the house! A pair in the trailer and I think one or two others kicking around somewhere!
1031115,gordy28,2018-07-13 13:27:00,638,Love my crocs - they are ugly but comfortable and great for around the cottage Drain water easily and are cooler than running shoes
