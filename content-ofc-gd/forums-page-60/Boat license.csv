1031855,Mr.Topwater!,2018-07-28 01:22:00,81,Hey everybody. I'm buying my first boat (new). Does the dealer usually do the licensing stuff for the buyer? Thanks. T.
1031858,Rattletrap2,2018-07-28 01:42:00,1652,"Yes, if it is new from a dealer, they should register the boat and install the numbers on the hull. If there is a trailer involved, they should get the plate for that as well unless you already have a trailer plate for it."
1031928,David Chong,2018-07-30 01:53:00,836,Any decent dealer should take care of this for you!
1031950,Lape0019,2018-07-30 14:35:00,647,"I know mine did. When I bought my first boat used, I had to transfer everything myself but the dealer for the new one took care of everything."
